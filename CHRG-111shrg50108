CONSUMER  PROTECTION 
AND  THE  CREDIT  CRISIS 
THURSDAY,  FEBRUARY  26,  2009 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:03  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Senator  John  D. 
Rockefeller, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We’ll  come  to  order.  As  I  think  I’ve  said  before 
to  Members,  I  will  give  an  opening  statement  and  Senator  Wicker 
will give an opening statement if he wishes to. But that will be all 
because the whole philosophy is to get to the witnesses, and to lis-
ten to the witnesses and hear what they have to say. 

Then  we’ll  go  into  a  period  of  questions.  The  questions  will  be 
based upon first come, first serve, so to speak. The people who have 
statements  can  work  that  into  their  questions.  Then  we’ll  have  as 
many  rounds  of  questions  as  we  need,  except  for  a  vote  which  is 
coming up at 10:30. And we’ll handle that. 

So  we’re  having  our  first  policy  and  oversight  hearing  of  the 
111th  Congress  today  in  the  Commerce  Committee.  What  we’re 
going to do is to highlight and to uncover what I think are abusive 
practices that take advantage of American families. 

I decided to hold the first hearing on this topic as the new Chair-
man for a very specific reason. We have a lot of huge subjects that 
we look at in terms of aviation, transportation, oceans, atmosphere, 
climate  change,  all  kinds  of  things.  But  the  most  important  aspect 
of  what’s  going  on  in  America  right  now  is  the  suffering  of  the 
American people. 

And  that’s  true  in  my  State  of  West  Virginia.  It’s  true  in  your 
state.  It’s  true  in  your  state,  Senator.  We  have  to  be  sensitive  to 
that.  We  want  to  expose  that  and  see  what  we  can  do  about  that. 
In  spite  of  our  broad  jurisdiction  I  want  the  American  people  to 
know  that  what  is  going  to  be  a  big  part  under  my  Chairmanship 
is  people.  People  in  trouble.  People  that  are  hurting  and  how  we 
can  help  them.  We’ve  got  to  do  that  as  we  do  all  the  other  large 
NASA-like subjects that we have to do very thoroughly as well. 

Families  are  hurting  all  across  the  country.  We  all  know  that. 
They’re  counting  on  Congress  to  help  them  out.  I  sincerely  hope 
that  this  committee  will  always  focus  attention  on  that,  on  people 
who  are  just  hurting.  There  are  just  so  many  and  it’s  going  to  get 
worse before it gets better.

2 

It  sickens  me  to  say  that  during  these  extremely  difficult  times 
there  are  really  some  outrageous,  from  my  point  of  view,  fraudu-
lent practices happening every single day to people that aren’t nec-
essarily  prepared  to  combat  them.  We  have  identified  some  of  the 
worst  offenders  operating  under  the  guise  of  providing  consumers 
with  assistance,  with  the  intention,  in  fact,  of  doing  anything  but 
that.  Deceitful  fraudsters  are  aggressively  working  to  attract  con-
sumers with false promises, offering misleading credit repair, credit 
counseling,  debt  management  and  mortgage  rescue  services.  It’s 
really quite stunning in fact. 

As  the  financial  crisis  increases  by  the  day  and  families  do  all 
they can just to survive and individuals, what I would say are peo-
ple  with  criminal  instincts  who  are  looking  to  make  big  dollars 
through illegal channels, they also increase. When more people are 
in  distress,  more  people  want  to  take  advantage  of  the  people  in 
distress.  The  plummeting  markets  have  encouraged  many  with  ill 
will  to  create  multiple  opportunities  for  both  sophisticated  institu-
tions  and  criminal,  in  my  judgment,  activity  to  take  advantage  of 
people in desperate situations. Nothing concerns me more than the 
cold, hard reality that hard-working Americans are being swindled. 
Imagine  a  family  where  the  parents  are  working  two  or  three 
jobs just to make ends meet. The money coming in just barely cov-
ers the cost of food, cost of the mortgage, cost of clothing while the 
debt  in  the  meantime  is  piling  up  as  they  struggle  to  pay  for  pre-
scriptions, the broken appliance or other things which they have to 
do. Can’t avoid but doing, but can’t do. 

And  all  of  a  sudden  the  phone  rings.  Someone  on  the  other  line 
is promising a chance for a way out. They use slick advertising, lots 
of it, television, radio. 

Confusing language and rushed tactics to lure these folks in. But 
it’s  all  a  lie.  The  family  is  swindled.  Swindled.  They  could  lose  it 
all and many do because they’re innocent of what these tactics en-
tail and how they can counter them. And they feel alone and help-
less. 

During  this  period  of  unfathomable  uncertainty  families  are 
thinking  more  thoughtfully  about  their  spending  habits.  They’re 
seeking  out  advice  from  experts  if  they  know  them  to  help  them 
manage  their  finances.  Often  these  financial  services  help  keep 
families afloat. It works. Sometimes they do not. 

That’s why we’re here today—to weed out the good from the bad 
and  discuss  ways  that  we  can  protect  as  many  consumers  as  pos-
sible in the months and years to come. So we’ve gathered an expert 
panel of witnesses, as always, to discuss what’s happening to fami-
lies once they pay for services to help them manage their debt, re-
pair their credit scores or to try to or refinance their homes. 

We  have  a  West  Virginia  witness  here  today,  I’m  very  proud  to 
say,  whose  testimony  will  typify  the  type  of  abuse  that  we  aim  to 
tackle. I look forward to hearing her testimony in person and work-
ing  with  my  colleagues  to  consider  what  steps  we  might  take  to 
make sure that these kinds of things don’t happen again. 

You  know,  the  Committee  has  the  authority  to  help  people  have 
real opportunities to participate in the American dream. The ques-
tion  is  are  we  using  it?  Do  we  wish  to  use  it?  Do  we  have  the  will 
to  use  it  and  to  live  healthier  and  safer  lives?  With  today’s  eco-

nomic  circumstances  it’s  even  more  important  that  the  Congress 
step in, speak up and protect those who need it most. 

Ms. Nancy Dix from Ansted is here today to testify about a fore-
closure  rescue  scam  that  nearly  cost  her,  her  home.  And  I’m  anx-
ious to hear it. Mrs. Dix, thank you for appearing before this com-
mittee. 

We’re also going to hear from Professor Prentiss Cox of the Uni-
versity of Minnesota Law School. Where’s Professor Cox? OK, good. 
He is one of the preeminent experts in the land on mortgage fraud 
and  consumer  protection  and  is  the  former  head  of  consumer  pro-
tection for the Minnesota State Attorney General’s Office. 

Following  Professor  Cox  will  be  Travis  Plunkett,  Legislative  Di-
rector for the Consumer Federation of America. Mr. Plunkett is an 
expert  on  issues  involving  credit  counseling  and  the  debt  manage-
ment market and has been doing significant work in this area. 

Finally,  we  will  hear  then  from—don’t  worry,  Madam  Chair-
person, I haven’t forgotten you. We’ll hear from Bill Himpler, Exec-
utive  Vice  President  of  the  American  Financial  Services  Adminis-
tration. 

I thank all of you for agreeing to testify. 
First,  however,  I’d  like  to  call  on  FTC  Commissioner  Pamela 
Jones  Harbour.  The  FTC  is  the  Federal  Government’s  agency 
charged  with  protecting  consumers  from  these  scams.  I  know  the 
Commission  has  been  actively  trying  to  protect  consumers  from 
these  abuses.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  what  Commissioner  Har-
bour’s perspective is on the scope of the problem and what the FTC 
is doing about it. 

What I’d like to do is to have all the witnesses come to the table. 
Let’s listen to all of the witnesses’ testimony; there are not so many 
of  them,  and  they’ll  be  talking  about  things  which  have  common 
threads. Then we can ask them questions. 

So Commissioner Harbour, I turn it over to you. 

STATEMENT OF HON. PAMELA JONES HARBOUR, 
COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Ms. HARBOUR. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator 
Wicker,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  Pamela  Jones  Har-
bour, a Commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. And I ap-
preciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the 
FTC’s efforts to protect consumers in this time of financial distress. 
I would first like to emphasize that although the views expressed 
in  my  written  testimony  represent  the  views  of  the  Commission, 
my  oral  presentation  and  responses  to  your  questions  will  be  my 
own views and not necessarily those of the Commission or any indi-
vidual  Commissioner.  As  Members  of  the  Committee  are  well 
aware,  many  American  consumers  are  now  struggling  financially. 
With  the  downturn  in  the  economy  the  national  unemployment 
rate  last  month  was  7.6  percent.  The  highest  it  has  been  in  many 
years. 

Consumers also are sinking further and further into debt. In the 
third  quarter  of  2008,  the  percentage  of  borrowers  who  are  60  or 
more  days  past  due  on  their  mortgage  loans  increased  for  the  sev-
enth straight quarter. Similarly in January 2009 late payments on

credit cards in the United States topped record levels. And defaults 
rose sharply. 

Unfortunately  experience  teaches  that  some  bad  actors  will  seek 
to take advantage of consumers when they are down. These bad ac-
tors  make  false  promises  to  consumers  about  the  credit  they  can 
obtain,  the  home  foreclosures  they  can  avoid  and  the  debt  burden 
they  can  ease.  Our  mission  at  the  FTC  is  to  protect  the  consumer 
from  being  harmed  by  these  false  promises,  a  mission  that  has  in-
creased  relevance  and  poignancy  when  consumers  are  in  financial 
distress. 

At the FTC we protect consumers at every stage of the credit life 
cycle,  from  when  debt  is  first  advertised  to  when  debts  are  col-
lected.  The  Commission  does  this  by  enforcing  Section  Five  of  the 
FTC  Act  which  prohibits  unfair  and  deceptive  acts  or  practices  as 
well  as  by  enforcing  a  number  of  special  statutes  governing  finan-
cial services including the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Debt Col-
lection Practices Act and the Credit Repair Organizations Act. 

Pursuant  to  these  statutes  the  FTC  investigates  and  brings  law 
enforcement actions against brokers, lenders and others who decep-
tively and unfairly advertise or offer credit, creditors and servicers 
who  misrepresent  fees  and  amounts  owed  and  abusive  debt  collec-
tors,  credit  repair  companies,  debt  settlement  firms  and  mortgage 
foreclosure  scam  artists  who  target  delinquent  consumers  or  those 
who  are  in  default.  Responding  to  the  current  financial  crisis  the 
FTC has increased its focus on preventing harm to consumers who 
are  already  in  debt  by  stepping  up  its  law  enforcement  activities 
relating  to  foreclosure  rescue  scams,  debt  relief  services,  credit  re-
pair  and  debt  collection.  We  also  have  created  and  distributed  ex-
tensive consumer education materials about these and other finan-
cial  services  topics  to  assist  consumers  in  taking  steps  to  protect 
themselves. 

The  Commission  has  conducted  cutting  edge,  empirical  research 
on mortgage disclosures as well as engaged in comprehensive policy 
development  activities  relating  to  debt  collection  and  debt  settle-
ment.  In  particular,  the  FTC  today  is  issuing  its  debt  collection 
workshop  report.  This  report  takes  a  comprehensive  look  at  how 
the  debt  collection  industry  has  changed  in  the  last  30  years  and 
recommends  a  number  of  changes  in  the  law  to  modernize  into  re-
form the debt collection regulatory system. 

The  FTC  believes  that  its  past  efforts  have  provided  important 
protections  to  the  American  consumer  in  financial  distress.  The 
Agency  recognizes,  however,  that  it  must  do  more.  To  allow  the 
Commission  to  perform  a  greater  and  more  effective  role  in  pro-
tecting  consumers  in  financial  distress,  the  Agency  recommends 
that Congress permit the FTC to employ notice and comment rule-
making  procedures  to  declare  acts  and  practices  relating  to  finan-
cial services to be unfair or deceptive in violation of the FTC. 

The CHAIRMAN. Can you repeat that sentence, please? 
Ms. HARBOUR. The Agency, the FTC, recommends that Congress 
permit  us,  permit  the  FTC,  to  employ  notice  and  comment  rule-
making  procedures.  That’s  APA  rulemaking  authority,  to  declare 
acts  and  practices  relating  to  financial  services  to  be  unfair  or  de-
ceptive in violation of our FTC Act.

The  Agency  also  recommends  that  Congress  authorize  broader 
civil  penalty  authority  for  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  and  au-
thorize  it  to  bring,  in  Federal  court,  suit  to  obtain  civil  penalties. 
The  Agency  also  recommends  that  Congress  authorize  the  FTC 
to  promulgate  rules  to  implement  the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Prac-
tices Act. 

And  the  Agency  also  recommends  that  Congress  provide  us  with 
substantial additional resources to assist the FTC in increasing its 
law  enforcement  activities  relating  to  consumer  financial  services 
and  expanding  its  critical  empirical  work  on  the  efficacy  of  mort-
gage disclosures. 

With your help the FTC can and will do more to help consumers 
in financial distress. I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  other  Members  of  the  Committee  for  the 
opportunity to speak today. And I would be very pleased to answer 
your questions. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Harbour follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. PAMELA JONES HARBOUR, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

I. Introduction 

Chairman  Rockefeller,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison,  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee, I am Pamela Jones Harbour, a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion  (‘‘FTC’’  or  ‘‘Commission’’).1 I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you 
today to discuss the Commission’s efforts to help consumers in financial distress. 

The  Commission  protects  consumers  from  harmful  acts  and  practices  at  every 
stage  of  the  credit  life-cycle,  from  when  credit  is  first  advertised  to  when  debts  are 
collected. At the early stages of the cycle, the FTC protects consumers from the un-
fair, deceptive, or otherwise unlawful acts and practices of brokers, lenders, and oth-
ers who advertise or offer credit. The agency also protects consumers at the middle 
stages  of  the  credit  life-cycle  from  the  unlawful  conduct  of  creditors  and  servicers 
who  collect  payments  from  consumers  who  are  current  on  their  debts.  At  the  later 
stages of the cycle, the Commission protects consumers who are delinquent or in de-
fault  on  their  debts  from  the  unlawful  acts  and  practices  of  debt  collectors,  credit 
repair companies, debt settlement firms, and mortgage foreclosure scam artists. 

Although the agency protects consumers throughout the credit life-cycle, the FTC 
recently  has  increased  its  focus  on  preventing  harm  to  consumers  who  are  already 
in  debt.  Consumer  debt  is  now  at  historic  levels.2 Moreover,  the  recent  economic 
downturn  has  made  it  even  more  difficult  for  consumers  with  high  debt  levels  to 
remain current on their mortgages, credit cards, and other types of debts.3 In short, 
many American consumers are now in financial distress. 

Consumers  in  financial  distress  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  unfair,  deceptive, 
and  otherwise  unlawful  business  practices.  Some  debt  collectors  use  unfair,  decep-

1 The views expressed in this statement represent the views of the Commission. My oral pres-
entation  and  responses  to  any  questions  are  my  own,  however,  and  do  not  necessarily  reflect 
the views of the Commission or any other Commissioner. 

2 Between 1985 and 2007, outstanding household debt in the United States increased from ap-
proximately 60 percent of annual disposable income to more than 125 percent, a jump due most-
ly to increased mortgage debt. See Federal Trade Commission, ‘‘Collecting Consumer Debts: The 
Challenges  of  Change,  A  Report  by  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,’’  at  16  (Feb.  26,  2009).  The 
ratio of household indebtedness to annual disposable income peaked at 126 percent in the third 
quarter of 2007. Since that time, the latest available data indicate that, as of the third quarter 
of 2008, the ratio has declined slightly to 123 percent. This remains well above typical indebted-
ness levels in the past two decades. See id. 

3 For example, the percentage of borrowers 3 who are 60 or more days past due on their mort-
gage  loans  increased  for  the  seventh  straight  quarter  in  the  third  quarter  of  2008,  reaching  a 
national average of 3.96 percent. Press Release, TransUnion, Mortgage Loan Delinquency Rates 
Rise for Seventh Straight Quarter (Dec. 8, 2008), available at http://newsroom.transunion.com/ 
index.php?s=43&item=502.  This  figure  is  approximately  54  percent  higher  than  the  figure  for 
the  third  quarter  of  2007.  Id.  Similarly,  in  January  2009  late  payments  on  credit  cards  in  the 
United  States  topped  record  levels,  and  defaults  rose  sharply  to  just  below  all-time  highs.  Al

tive,  or  abusive  practices  such  as  threats  of  imprisonment  or  harassing  calls  to  try 
to  compel  consumers  to  pay  their  debts.  Some  debt  settlement  firms  promise  for  a 
fee  to  negotiate  settlements  with  creditors  that  will  result  in  consumers  owing  less 
than  the  full  amount  of  the  balance  on  their  credit  cards,  but  in  fact  these  firms 
do not negotiate the promised reductions. Some credit repair companies promise for 
a fee to be able to remove delinquencies, bankruptcies, and other negative informa-
tion from the credit reports of consumers, but these companies cannot remove such 
information  if  it  is  truthful  and  accurate.  Finally,  some  scam  artists  target  con-
sumers facing home foreclosure and promise that for a fee they will be able to nego-
tiate a deal with lenders or servicers that will allow the consumers to stay in their 
homes.  However,  consumers  later  learn  that  no  one  has  taken  steps  to  save  their 
homes  from  foreclosure,  resulting  in  many  consumers  losing  both  the  fee  and  their 
homes. 

The  Commission  has  used  all  the  tools  at  its  disposal  to  increase  its  protection 
of  consumers  in  the  later  stages  of  the  credit  life-cycle.  The  FTC  has  brought  law 
enforcement actions against those who engage in unfair or deceptive acts and prac-
tices  in  violation  of  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act,  as  well  as  against  those  who  violate 
specific  credit  statutes,  such  as  the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act  (‘‘FDCPA’’) 
and the Credit Repair Organizations Act (‘‘CROA’’). The agency has created and dis-
tributed  extensive  consumer  education  materials  about  debt  collection,  debt  relief 
services,  credit  repair,  foreclosure  rescue  scams,  and  other  financial  services  topics 
to assist consumers in financial distress in taking steps to protect themselves.4 The 
Commission has conducted cutting-edge empirical research on how to improve mort-
gage disclosures and engaged in comprehensive policy development activities related 
to debt collection and debt settlement. 

The  FTC  believes  that  its  past  efforts  have  provided  important  protections  to 
American consumers in financial distress. The agency, however, also recognizes that 
it  must  do  more.  To  allow  the  Commission  to  perform  a  greater  and  more  effective 
role in protecting consumers in financial distress, the agency recommends the enact-
ment of legislation that would: 

• permit  the  FTC  to  employ  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  procedures  to  de-
clare  acts  and  practices  relating  to  financial  services  to  be  unfair  or  deceptive 
in violation of the FTC Act; 
• authorize the FTC to obtain civil penalties for unfair or deceptive acts and prac-
tices  related  to  financial  services,  and  authorize  the  FTC  to  bring  suit  in  Fed-
eral court to obtain civil penalties; 

• authorize the FTC to promulgate rules to implement the FDCPA; and 
• provide additional resources to assist the FTC in increasing its law enforcement 
activities  related  to  consumer  financial  services  and  expanding  its  critical  em-
pirical work on the efficacy of disclosures. 

This testimony will provide an overview of the FTC’s consumer protection author-
ity related to financial services, describe how the Commission has used its consumer 
protection  tools  on  behalf  of  consumers  throughout  the  credit  life-cycle,  and  rec-
ommend changes in the law and resources to enable the FTC to do more to protect 
consumers in financial distress. 
II. Overview of Commission Authority 

The  Commission  has  law  enforcement  authority  over  a  wide  range  of  acts  and 
practices  related  to  financial  services.  The  agency  enforces  Section  5  of  the  Federal 
Trade  Commission  Act,5 which  prohibits  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices  in  or 
affecting  commerce.  In  addition,  among  other  specific  financial  services  statutes,6 
the  FTC  enforces  the  FDCPA,7 which  prohibits  unfair,  deceptive,  or  abusive  debt 
collection practices by third-party debt collectors. It also enforces the CROA,8 which 
prohibits credit repair firms from making false statements about their ability to im-

4 The  FTC  also  participates  in  the  governmental  Financial  Literacy  and  Education  Commis-
sion and has contributed its expertise to the production of MyMoney.gov and Taking Ownership 
of the Future: The National Strategy for Financial Literacy. 

5 15 U.S.C. § 45(a). 
6 The FTC enforces numerous consumer protection statutes that govern financial services pro-
viders, including the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1601–1666j), the Consumer Leasing Act 
(15  U.S.C.  §§ 1667–1667f),  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act  (15  U.S.C.  §§ 1681–1681x)  (‘‘FCRA’’), 
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C.  §§ 1691–1691f), the Electronic Funds Transfer Act 
(15  U.S.C.  1693–1693r),  and  the  privacy  and  pretexting  provisions  of  the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 6801–6809).

prove  the  credit  rating  of  consumers  and  from  charging  an  advance  fee  before  pro-
viding  credit  repair  services.  The  FTC  Act,  as  well  as  the  FDCPA  and  CROA,  pro-
vide  the  fundamental  authority  that  the  Commission  uses  to  take  law  enforcement 
action  against  those  whose  acts  and  practices  harm  consumers  in  the  later  stages 
of the credit life-cycle. 

Although  the  Commission  has  the  authority  to  take  action  against  a  wide  array 
of acts and practices in the financial services arena, some financial service providers 
are  exempt  from  the  FTC’s  jurisdiction.  Banks,  thrifts,  and  Federal  credit  unions 
are specifically exempt from the Commission’s jurisdiction under the FTC Act.9 The 
FTC’s jurisdiction under the FTC Act extends only to non-bank financial companies, 
including  non-bank  mortgage  companies,  mortgage  brokers,  and  finance  companies. 
Similarly, under the FDCPA and CROA, the Commission has jurisdiction over non- 
bank  entities  covered  by  these  statutes,  including  debt  collectors  and  credit  repair 
organizations, respectively.10 

In  conducting  its  law  enforcement  and  other  activities,  the  FTC  often  cooperates 
with  other  agencies,  such  as  the  Federal  agencies  who  have  authority  over  banks, 
thrifts,  and  Federal  credit  unions.  Even  more  significant  in  the  context  of  assisting 
consumers  in  financial  distress,  the  FTC  has  a  history  of  close  cooperation  with 
many state attorneys general and state banking departments on issues such as debt 
collection, foreclosure rescue scams, and credit repair. 
III. The FTC’s Protection of Consumers During the Credit Life-Cycle 
A. Marketing and Advertising of Consumer Credit 

A consumer’s credit life-cycle begins when he or she initially shops for a mortgage, 
credit card, auto loan, or any other form of credit. In the area of marketing and ad-
vertising  of  credit,  the  FTC  has  brought  numerous  enforcement  actions  challenging 
deceptive or illegal marketing by lenders, brokers, or other advertisers of consumer 
credit in violation of the FTC Act or the Truth in Lending Act.11 In mortgage adver-
tising,  for  example,  the  Commission  has  brought  actions  against  mortgage  lenders 
or  brokers  for  deceptive  marketing  of  loan  costs 12 or  other  key  loan  terms,  such  as 
the existence of a prepayment penalty 13 or a large balloon payment due at the end 
of  the  loan.14 Most  recently,  the  Commission  announced  settlements  with  three 
mortgage  lenders  charged  with  using  ads  that  touted  low  interest  rates  and  low 
monthly  payments,  but  failing  to  adequately  disclose  that  the  low  rates  and  pay-
ment amounts would increase substantially after a limited period of time.15 

The FTC has also brought enforcement actions against credit card marketers and 
advertisers.  In  June  2008,  the  FTC  sued  a  credit  card  marketing  company, 
CompuCredit  Corporation,  for  allegedly  deceptively  marketing  its  credit  cards  to 
subprime  consumers  nationwide,  primarily  through  solicitations  that  misrepre-
sented  the  amount  of  available  credit  and  failed  to  adequately  disclose  the  cost  of 
that  credit.16 Last  December,  CompuCredit  agreed  to  settle  this  case  for  an  esti-
mated $114 million in credits as redress to consumers.17 

The  Commission  believes  the  CompuCredit  case  provides  valuable  insight  into 
consumers’  experiences  in  procuring  credit  and  going  into  debt.  Deceptively  mar-
keting  the  costs  of  a  credit  product  can  have  long-lasting  consequences  for  many

17, 2009); In the Matter of Michael Gendrolis, FTC Dkt. No. C–4248 (Feb. 17, 2009). 

16 Although  the  credit  cards  were  issued  by  16  various  FDIC-regulated  banks,  CompuCredit 
created, designed, and distributed the credit card marketing materials that the Commission al-
leged were deceptive. As discussed above, the Commission does not have jurisdiction over banks, 
which issue nearly all credit cards in the United States. The FTC, however, does have jurisdic-
tion over non-bank entities that market or advertise credit cards. The Commission worked close-
ly  on  this  case  with  the  FDIC,  which  brought  a  parallel  action  challenging  this  deceptive  con-
duct.

consumers.  In  this  case,  for  instance,  the  deceptive  marketing  led  many  consumers 
to believe they would receive $300 in available credit, but instead they were charged 
$185  in  fees  and  therefore  initially  received  only  $115  in  credit.  Many  consumers 
were  pushed  over  their  credit  limits  almost  immediately  because  they  did  not  have 
as  much  credit  as  they  thought  they  would  have.  These  consumers  were  sent  into 
a  debt  spiral  from  which  they  could  not  recover,  and  as  a  result,  their  debts  were 
charged  off  by  CompuCredit,  in  turn  worsening  their  credit  scores  and  further  lim-
iting their financial options. 

The CompuCredit case also highlights what happens as more and more consumers 
face growing debt. Debt collectors are developing innovative approaches to collecting 
charged-off  debt.  CompuCredit  and  Jefferson  Capital,  its  debt  collection  subsidiary, 
allegedly  marketed  a  credit  card  specifically  to  consumers  with  charged-off  debt. 
This  type  of  program  encourages  consumers  to  enroll  in  a  debt  repayment  plan  in 
order  to  obtain  a  credit  card.  Once  a  consumer  pays  down  a  specific  amount  of  his 
or  her  outstanding  debt,  the  consumer  is  eligible  for  a  credit  card  with  a  minimal 
amount  of  available  credit.  These  debt  repayment  offers  may  be  marketed  to  con-
sumers  whose  debts  were  discharged  in  bankruptcy  or  whose  debts  are  no  longer 
reportable pursuant to the FCRA.18 As a consequence, consumers who receive debt- 
transfer  credit  card  offers  may  be  induced  to  re-validate  an  old  debt,  for  which  col-
lection action might not otherwise have been possible. Because of its impact on con-
sumers  in  financial  distress,  the  FTC  will  continue  to  monitor  the  marketplace  for 
this type of debt collection practice. 
B. Mortgage Servicing 

In  the  mortgage  market,  servicers  collect  payments  for  lenders  and  other  owners 
of  mortgage  loans.  The  FTC  has  challenged  deceptive  and  unfair  practices  in  the 
servicing of mortgage loans, addressing core issues such as failing to post payments 
upon receipt, charging unauthorized fees, and engaging in deceptive or abusive debt 
collection  tactics.  For  example,  in  September  2008,  the  FTC  settled  charges  that 
EMC Mortgage Corporation and its parent, The Bear Stearns Companies, LLC, vio-
lated  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act,  the  FDCPA,  and  the  FCRA  in  servicing  consumers’ 
mortgage  loans,  including  debts  that  were  in  default  when  EMC  obtained  them.19 
Among  other  practices,  the  complaint  alleged  that  the  defendants:  (1)  misrepre-
sented  the  amounts  consumers  owed;  (2)  assessed  and  collected  unauthorized  fees; 
and  (3)  misrepresented  that  they  had  a  reasonable  basis  to  substantiate  their  rep-
resentations  about  consumers’  mortgage  loan  debts.  The  complaint  further  alleged 
the  defendants  made  harassing  collection  calls;  falsely  represented  the  character, 
amount, or legal status of consumers’ debts; and used false representations and de-
ceptive means to collect on mortgage loans. 

The  EMC  settlement  required  the  defendants  to  pay  $28  million  in  consumer  re-
dress, barred them from future law violations, and imposed new restrictions on their 
business practices. In particular, it required EMC to establish and maintain a com-
prehensive data integrity program to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data 
and  other  information  about  consumers’  loan  accounts  before  servicing  those  ac-
counts. 

In  addition  to  law  enforcement,  the  Commission  provides  mortgage  borrowers 
with  tools  to  protect  themselves.  For  example,  the  FTC  distributes  consumer  edu-
cation materials on mortgage servicing,20 what to do if you are having trouble mak-
ing  your  mortgage  payments,21 and  how  to  manage  your  mortgage  if  your  lender 
closes or files for bankruptcy.22 The Commission also uses innovative approaches to 
reach out to consumers in other ways. This January, the FTC included a bookmark, 
‘‘Numbers to Know & Places to Go,’’ with contacts for more information about assist-
ance  with  financial  services  along  with  the  redress  checks  sent  to  over  86,000  con-
sumers as a result of the Commission’s settlement with EMC. 
C. Debt Collection 

Consumer  credit  is  a  critical  component  of  today’s  economy.  Credit  allows  con-
sumers  to  purchase  goods  and  services  for  which  they  are  unable  or  unwilling  to 
pay the entire cost at the time of purchase. By extending credit, however, creditors 

18 15  U.S.C.  §§ 1681–1681x.  Section  605(a)(4)  of  the  FCRA  prohibits  credit  reporting  agencies 

from reporting charge-offs that are more than 7 years old. 15 U.S.C. § 1681c.

take  the  risk  that  consumers  will  not  repay  all  or  part  of  the  amount  they  owe.  If 
consumers  do  not  pay  their  debts,  creditors  may  become  less  willing  to  lend  money 
to  consumers,  or  may  increase  the  cost  of  borrowing  money.  Creditors  typically  use 
independent  or  third-party  collectors  to  try  to  recover  on  debts  to  decrease  the 
amount  of  their  lost  revenues.  Debt  collection  thus  helps  keep  credit  available  and 
its cost as low as possible. 

Some debt collection activities, however, also may harm consumers. In 1977, Con-
gress passed legislation to protect consumers from harmful debt collection practices 
and  to  protect  ethical  collectors  from  competitive  disadvantage.  The  result  was  the 
landmark  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act,  which  established  specific  standards 
of conduct for the collection industry. Consumer groups, labor groups, state and Fed-
eral  enforcement  officials,  and  collection  industry  trade  associations  supported  the 
law’s passage. The Commission is the primary governmental enforcer of the FDCPA. 
Consumers also may file their own actions against debt collectors. 

The FDCPA prohibits abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices, and 
specifies  numerous  practices  that  are  barred.  The  FTC  receives  more  complaints 
about  debt  collectors  than  any  other  industry.23 The  consumer  complaints  include 
demands  for  payments  that  are  not  owed  or  larger  than  owed,  harassment,  false 
threats  of  legal  or  other  action,  impermissible  calls  to  the  consumer’s  place  of  em-
ployment, revealing debts to third parties, and other law violations. 

Since  1999,  the  FTC  has  brought  21  lawsuits  for  illegal  debt  collection  practices. 
In these cases, the Commission has obtained strong permanent injunctive and equi-
table  relief,  including  substantial  monetary  judgments  and,  for  some  defendants, 
bans  on  collecting  debts.24 In  addition,  the  FTC  has  held  more  individuals,  rather 
than  just  companies,  liable  for  unlawful  debt  collection  practices.  As  an  example  of 
the FTC’s current approach to law enforcement, in November 2008, Academy Collec-
tion  Service,  Inc.  (‘‘Academy’’)  and  its  owner,  Keith  Dickstein,  agreed  to  pay  $2.25 
million in civil penalties to settle charges that they violated the FDCPA and Section 
5  of  the  FTC  Act.25 This  is  the  largest  civil  penalty  that  the  Commission  has  ever 
obtained in an FDCPA case.26 

Although  the  Commission  has  provided  effective  protection  for  consumers  within 
the  current  confines  of  the  law,  the  FTC  recognized  that  the  law  may  need  to  be 
modified  to  provide  consumers  with  even  stronger  protection  against  abusive  debt 
collectors.  In  October  2007,  the  Commission  therefore  hosted  a  two-day  workshop, 
entitled ‘‘Collecting Consumer Debts: The Challenges of Change,’’ to explore changes 
in  the  debt  collection  industry  and  examine  their  impact  on  consumers  and  busi-
nesses since the FDCPA was enacted in 1977. 

The  FTC  is  releasing  its  debt  collection  workshop  report  today.  Based  on  the 
workshop  record  and  its  experience,  the  Commission  concludes  that  debt  collection 
law  needs  reform  and  modernization  to  reflect  changes  in  consumer  debt,  the  debt 
collection  industry,  and  technology.  The  Report  discusses  these  changes  and  sets 
forth the modifications to the law the FTC believes are needed to provide better con-
sumer protection without unduly burdening debt collection. 

Among  other  things,  the  Report  concludes  that  major  problems  exist  in  the  flow 
of  information  within  the  debt  collection  system.  The  law  needs  to  be  changed  to 
require that debt collectors have better information, making it more likely their at-
tempts to collect are for the right amount and are directed to the correct consumers. 
The  Report  also  recommends  that  collectors  be  required  to  provide  consumers  with 
better information explaining their rights under the FDCPA. 

The  Commission  also  concludes  that  debt  collection  laws  must  be  modernized  to 
take account of changes in technology. The Report recognizes that the law generally 
should  allow  debt  collectors  to  use  all  communication  technologies,  including  new 
and emerging technologies, to contact consumers. However, it is important that the 
law  be  carefully  crafted  and  applied  to  avoid  collectors’  use  of  communication  tech-

at 4, available at http://www2.ftc.gov/os/2008/03/P084802fdcpareport.pdf. Note that, although 
the FDCPA generally does not cover the conduct of creditors collecting on their own debts, Sec-
tion 5 of the FTC Act’s prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices does apply to such 
conduct. 

24 See,  e.g.,  FTC  v.  Check  Investors,  Inc.,  2005  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  37199  (D.N.J.  July  18,  2005)

nologies in a manner that causes consumers to incur charges, or otherwise subjects 
them to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. 

The workshop record also revealed that certain debt collection litigation and arbi-
tration  practices  appear  to  raise  substantial  consumer  protection  concerns.  Because 
the  workshop  record  does  not  contain  adequate  information  for  the  FTC  to  deter-
mine the nature and extent of these concerns, the Report announces that the agency 
will  convene  regional  roundtables  this  year  with  state  court  judges  and  officials, 
debt  collectors,  collection  attorneys,  consumer  advocates,  arbitration  firms,  and 
other  interested  stakeholders  to  obtain  more  information  about  these  concerns  and 
develop  possible  solutions.  The  participation  of  state  officials  in  these  roundtables 
will be critical, because debt collection litigation and arbitration involve many issues 
of state as well as Federal law. 
D. Debt Relief Services and Credit Repair 
Foreclosure Rescue Scams 

With the rapid increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, the FTC has 
intensified  its  efforts  to  protect  consumers  from  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue 
scams.27 There are many varieties of mortgage foreclosure rescue fraud, but in most 
cases  the  perpetrator  makes  misleading  promises  that  a  consumer’s  home  will  be 
saved  from  foreclosure  and  that  the  consumer’s  loan  can  be  modified.  These  scams 
share at least two common characteristics. First, the fraudulent schemes target con-
sumers  who  are  facing  foreclosure  or  delinquency  on  their  mortgage  and  who  have 
limited time and resources to save their homes. Second, these schemes falsely prom-
ise  that  they  can  save  consumers’  homes  from  foreclosure  or  obtain  a  loan  workout 
or modification chiefly by negotiating directly with the mortgage lender or servicer. 
Many  consumers,  however,  ultimately  lose  both  their  homes  and  the  money  they 
paid to scammers. 

In  the  past  year,  the  Commission  has  brought  six  cases  targeting  mortgage  fore-
closure  rescue  scams,28 including  a  case  announced  earlier  this  month.29 In  these 
cases, the Commission alleged that the defendants promise to stop foreclosure in ex-
change for an up-front consumer payment, ranging from $500 to $1,200. After a con-
sumer  makes  the  payment,  the  defendants  do  little  or  nothing  to  stop  the  fore-
closure.  This  fraud  deprives  consumers  not  only  of  much-needed  funds  but  also  of 
the  opportunity  to  explore  realistic  options  to  avoid  foreclosure,  including  with  the 
assistance  of  a  non-profit  housing  counselor.  In  one  case,  the  Commission  alleged 
that  the  defendants  enticed  consumers  into  a  second  mortgage  or  home  equity  line 
of credit on very unfavorable terms without fully disclosing the costs, risks, and con-
sequences of doing so.30 

In tandem with its recent law enforcement actions against alleged foreclosure res-
cue scams, the Commission initiated a stepped-up outreach initiative on foreclosure 
rescue fraud. The FTC is involved in Federal, state, and local task forces in several 
regions  where  foreclosures  are  most  prevalent  both  to  coordinate  enforcement  and 
develop consumer outreach strategies. In addition, to warn consumers about the red 
flags  for  scams  and  inform  them  about  the  legitimate  resources  available  to  them, 
the  Commission  has  undertaken  a  variety  of  other  outreach  initiatives.  The  FTC 
submitted  a  series  of  radio  public  service  announcements,  in  English  and  Spanish, 
to stations in cities hardest hit by mortgage foreclosures. The Commission also dis-
tributed  an  article  adapted  from  its  mortgage  foreclosure  scam  consumer  education 
brochure to a national syndicated news service, which in turn, sent it to more than 
10,000 community newspapers across the Nation for inclusion in their publications. 
2. Debt Settlement 

With  historically  high  levels  of  consumer  credit  card  debt,  many  consumers  are 
looking for ways to manage or reduce their debt. For decades, credit card debt relief 
was  almost  exclusively  the  province  of  non-profit  credit  counseling  agencies 
(‘‘CCAs’’). Beginning in the mid-1960s, creditor banks initiated the current model of 
non-profit credit counseling to reduce personal bankruptcy filings. Under this model,

CCAs  work  with  consumers  and  creditors  to  negotiate  a  repayment  plan  of  prin-
cipally  credit  card  debt  (a  ‘‘debt  management  plan’’  or  ‘‘DMP’’)  and  also  assist  the 
consumer  in  developing  a  manageable  budget  and  educational  tools  to  avoid  debt 
problems in the future.31 If the consumer cannot afford a repayment plan, the credit 
counselor explores other options, including referral to a bankruptcy attorney. 

The  historic  levels  of  consumer  debt  necessarily  have  affected  the  services  CCAs 
can provide. Non-profit credit counselors have told the Commission that the number 
of  consumers  contacting  them  about  debt  has  increased  by  over  a  third.  However, 
they  also  have  said  that  the  number  of  consumers  who  meet  the  income  require-
ments  to  enroll  in  debt  management  plans  has  decreased  substantially,  which 
means that there are more consumers in debt who are looking for relief but cannot 
obtain that relief from non-profit credit counseling services. These reports from cred-
it counselors are consistent with what the Commission has observed in the market-
place as part of its law enforcement activities related to debt settlement.32 

The increased demand for debt relief options resulted in the recent growth of for- 
profit  debt  settlement  companies.  The  term  ‘‘debt  settlement’’  refers  to  services  for- 
profit companies market that promise to obtain lump sum settlements of consumers’ 
unsecured  debt—principally,  credit  card  debt.  These  companies  typically  promise 
that  they  will  negotiate  with  creditors  to  obtain  settlements  in  amounts  less  than 
the  full  balance  owed  by  the  consumer.  The  for-profit  debt  settlement  business 
model  typically  encourages  consumers,  even  those  who  are  current  on  their  pay-
ments, to become delinquent on credit card debt to encourage creditors to accept less 
than full payment of principal as a form of loss mitigation. Unlike DMPs, debt set-
tlement  companies  do  not  consolidate  credit  card  debt  or  arrange  a  monthly  pay-
ment plan to pay off the debt over a period of years. Rather, the goal of debt settle-
ment  is  to  save  enough  cash,  while  not  paying  creditors,  so  that  the  creditors  will 
offer  to  take  a  fraction  of  the  balance  owed  as  settlement  in  lieu  of  the  full  debt. 
Since  2001,  the  Commission  has  brought  14  cases  against  both  sham  non-profit 
credit  counseling  agencies  and  for-profit  debt  settlement  companies.33 In  these 
cases,  defendants  allegedly  deceive  consumers  who  are  seeking  workout  options  for 
credit  card  debt  into  paying  large  upfront  fees  for  debt  relief  services  which,  for 
many consumers, are nonexistent. Other allegations include deceptive promises that 
debt collectors will stop trying to collect from consumers enrolled in their programs 
and  that  stopping  payments  to  creditors  under  their  program  will  not  hurt  con-
sumers’ creditworthiness. 

Earlier this month, the Commission brought a contempt action against an alleged 
sham  non-profit  credit  counseling  company  and  its  principal  for  violations  of  an 
order a Federal court entered against them in 2008.34 The defendants, Express Con-
solidation  and  Randall  Leshin,  misrepresented  their  non-profit  status,  charged  hid-
den  fees,  and  misled  consumers  about  the  benefits  of  enrolling  in  a  debt  manage-
ment  plan,  according  to  the  Commission’s  underlying  action.35 The  2008  order  pro-
hibited them from the illegal conduct and from operating in states where they were 
not qualified to do business. Notwithstanding being subject to a Federal court order, 
the  defendants  continued  to  do  business  in  states  where  they  were  unqualified  and 
to  collect  fees  from  consumers  who  had  canceled  their  debt  management  plans.  On 

31 To  negotiate  a  DMP,  the  credit  counselor  first  obtains  the  consumer’s  full  financial  profile. 
Then,  the  credit  counselor  contacts  each  of  the  consumer’s  creditors.  Based  principally  on  the 
consumer’s  debt  load  and  available  income,  the  creditor  then  determines  what,  if  any,  repay-
ment options to offer the consumer. Repayment options, or concessions, include reductions of the 
interest rate on the credit card and elimination of late or over-limit fees. After negotiations with 
all of the consumer’s creditors, the credit counselor calculates a consolidated and reduced month-
ly payment to enable the consumer to repay the balance in full over a period of years, typically 
three  to  5  years.  The  consumer  sends  the  payment  to  the  credit  counselor,  which  then  distrib-
utes payments to each of the consumer’s creditors.

February  17,  2009,  the  court  found  the  defendants  in  contempt  based  on  this  con-
duct. The Commission currently is seeking an order reimbursing consumers for any 
fees collected in violation of the 2008 order. 

As  part  of  its  research  and  policy  development  initiatives,  the  Commission  con-
vened  a  public  workshop  in  September  2008  to  examine  the  debt  settlement  indus-
try, including the role of creditors, and the consumer protection issues that the for- 
profit  business  model  raises.  As  a  result  of  this  workshop  and  the  FTC’s  law  en-
forcement experience, the Commission is considering what initiatives, in addition to 
continued aggressive enforcement, are needed to further protect consumers from de-
ceptive and unfair practices by purported debt relief companies. 
3. Credit Repair 

Another  consumer  protection  challenge  exacerbated  by  the  economic  downturn  is 
the  effect  of  delinquencies,  bankruptcy,  or  other  negative  credit  information  on  a 
consumer’s  credit  report.  Fraudulent  credit  repair  companies  falsely  promise  to  be 
able  to  remove  for  a  fee  accurate,  negative  information  from  consumers’  credit  re-
ports.  This  false  promise  particularly  appeals  to  consumers  with  poor  credit  his-
tories who are seeking a job, a car loan, or a mortgage. 

Consistent  with  its  efforts  to  combat  other  types  of  financial  fraud,  the  Commis-
sion has acted aggressively against such ‘‘credit repair’’ scams. Since 1999, the FTC 
has  brought  42  cases  against  defendants  that  allegedly  misrepresented  the  credit- 
related services they would provide. Most recently, in October 2008, the Commission 
and  24  state  agencies  announced  a  crackdown  on  33  credit  repair  operations—enti-
ties  that  deceptively  claimed  they  could  remove  negative  information  from  con-
sumers’ credit reports, even if that information was accurate and timely.36 The law 
enforcement sweep included ten FTC actions charging companies with violating the 
FTC Act and the CROA by making false and misleading statements, such as claim-
ing  they  could  substantially  improve  consumers’  credit  reports  by  removing  accu-
rate,  negative  information  from  credit  reports.  The  agency  also  alleged  that  the  de-
fendants  violated  the  CROA  by  charging  an  advance  fee  for  credit  repair  services. 
The sweep included 26 state actions alleging violations of state laws and the CROA. 
Our partnerships with state authorities have increased significantly the reach of the 
Commission’s  law  enforcement  efforts  to  promote  broader  compliance  with  the  law. 
IV. Enhancing FTC Consumer Protection Efforts 

As  described  above,  the  FTC  has  used  a  vigorous  program  of  law  enforcement, 
consumer  education,  and  research  and  policy  development  to  protect  consumers  of 
financial  services.  The  current  economic  crisis,  however,  demonstrates  that  more 
needs  to  be  done.  As  the  Nation’s  consumer  protection  agency,  the  Commission  is 
well-positioned to provide the additional protection that is needed. The FTC can pro-
vide  greater  protection  to  consumers  in  financial  distress  through  enhanced  and 
streamlined  authority  to  promulgate  rules,  including  rules  to  implement  the 
FDCPA,  increased  monitoring  and  oversight  to  assess  compliance  with  the  law,  ex-
panded authority to obtain civil penalties against those who violate the law, and in-
creased  policy-oriented  research  on  financial  services  subjects.  To  exercise  these  re-
sponsibilities in the robust manner necessary to confer greater consumer protection, 
the Commission will need substantial additional authority and resources. 
A. Rulemaking Authority 

The  Commission  would  be  able  to  be  develop  rules  concerning  financial  services 
more  quickly  and  effectively  if  the  procedures  required  for  issuing  such  rules  were 
streamlined;  that  is,  if  the  FTC  were  permitted  to  use  standard  government-wide 
notice and comment rulemaking procedures under Section 553 of the Administrative 
Procedures Act (‘‘APA’’) 37 to declare acts and practices to be unfair or deceptive. The 
FTC  currently  must  use  the  burdensome,  complicated,  and  time-consuming  proce-
dures  of  Section  18  of  the  FTC  Act  (‘‘Magnuson-Moss  rulemaking  procedures’’)  to 
promulgate  such  rules.38 Commission  rulemakings  subject  to  Magnuson-Moss  rule-
making  procedure  requirements  typically  take  anywhere  from  three  to  10  years  to 

36 See  Press  Release,  FTC’s  Operation  ‘‘Clean  Sweep’’  Targets  ‘‘Credit  Repair’’  Companies, 

available at http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/10/cleansweep.shtm. 

37 5 U.S.C. § 553. 
38 Section  18,  for  example,  includes  requirements  that  the  FTC  must  publish  an  advance  no-
tice  of  proposed  rulemaking  and  seek  public  comment  before  publishing  its  notice  of  proposed 
rulemaking; it must provide an opportunity for a hearing before a presiding officer at which in-
terested  persons  are  accorded  certain  cross-examination  rights;  and,  where  there  are  numerous 
interested  parties,  the  FTC  must  determine  which  have  similar  interests,  have  each  group  of 
persons  with  similar  interests  choose  a  representative,  and  make  further  determinations  about 
representation for those interests in the cross-examination process. 15 U.S.C. § 57a(b).

complete.  For  example,  the  proceeding  to  promulgate  the  FTC’s  Credit  Practices 
Rule 39 took almost 10 years. 

The cumbersome requirements of Section 18 of the FTC Act do not apply to other 
Federal agencies when they promulgate rules to protect consumers of financial serv-
ices from unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Most significantly, under the FTC 
Act itself, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (‘‘FRB’’), the Office 
of  Thrift  Supervision  (‘‘OTS’’),  and  the  National  Credit  Union  Administration 
(‘‘NCUA’’)  may  use  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  to  promulgate  such  rules  for 
banks, thrifts, and Federal credit unions, respectively.40 The FTC, by contrast, must 
use the onerous and lengthy Magnuson-Moss rulemaking procedures to address the 
exact  same  unfair  and  deceptive  acts  and  practices  by  financial  entities  within  the 
Commission’s  jurisdiction.  Changing  the  law  to  allow  the  Commission  to  use  the 
same  process  under  the  FTC  Act  as  used  by  the  Federal  banking  agencies  would 
promote  expedition  and  consistency  in  the  promulgation  of  rules  to  protect  con-
sumers of financial services. 

Similarly,  expeditiously  promulgating  rules  to  address  the  acts  and  practices  of 
debt collectors would be very beneficial in protecting consumers in financial distress. 
Section  814  of  the  FDCPA  specifically  prohibits  the  FTC  from  promulgating  rules 
concerning  the  collection  of  debts  by  debt  collectors.41 In  the  debt  collection  work-
shop  report  that  the  Commission  is  issuing  today,  the  agency  concluded  that  the 
debt collection legal framework should be changed to enable the FTC to issue rules 
to  implement  the  FDCPA  to  respond  better  to  changes  in  technology  and  the  mar-
ketplace.  As  with  the  rules  under  the  FTC  Act  that  address  unfair  and  deceptive 
acts  and  practices  related  to  financial  services,  the  Commission  would  be  able  to 
issue rules to implement the FDCPA quickly and effectively if the agency were able 
to  use  notice  and  comment  rulemaking  procedures  under  the  APA  to  promulgate 
them. 
B. Expand FTC Ability to Obtain Civil Penalties for Law Violations 

Civil penalties and other forms of monetary relief are vital to the effectiveness of 
the  Commission’s  law  enforcement  program,  because  they  punish  noncompliance 
and deter future violations. The FTC, however, does not have the authority to seek 
civil  penalties  for  violations  of  some  of  the  laws  that  it  enforces,  most  notably,  the 
FTC Act.42 Even in circumstances in which civil penalties are available to the FTC, 
the agency may not bring an action in Federal court seeking penalties without first 
referring  it  to  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  to  file  on  behalf  of  the  Commis-
sion.43 

First,  in  the  context  of  financial  services,  enhanced  civil  penalty  authority  would 
increase  deterrence  of  would-be  violators  within  the  FTC’s  jurisdiction.44 Equitable 
monetary  remedies,  such  as  redress  and  disgorgement,  may  not  be  appropriate  or 
sufficient  in  certain  cases,  and  the  availability  of  civil  penalties  against  the  wrong-
doers would likely achieve greater deterrence. 

The  Commission’s  recent  settlements  with  mortgage  advertisers  discussed 
above,45 for  example,  contained  no  monetary  relief.  The  FTC  did  not  seek  redress 
or  disgorgement  because  of  the  difficulty  in  quantifying  and  proving  consumer  in-
jury  attributable  to  the  particular  ads  challenged  in  those  cases.  Deterrence  of  un-
lawful  conduct  likely  would  be  increased  in  these  types  of  cases  if  civil  penalties 
were available as a remedy. 

In  addition  to  authorizing  civil  penalties  for  violations  of  all  consumer  protection 
laws  related  to  financial  services,  changes  to  the  process  required  to  obtain  those 
penalties would make law enforcement more effective. Giving the FTC independent 
litigating  authority  when  it  seeks  civil  penalties  would  allow  the  Commission—the 
agency with the greatest expertise in enforcing the FTC Act—to litigate some of its 

39 FTC Credit Practices Rule, 16 C.F.R. § 444. 
40 See 15 U.S.C. § 57a(f). 
41 See 15 U.S.C. § 1692l(d). 
42 Currently,  the  FTC  may  seek  civil  penalties  against  any  entity  that  knowingly  violates  a 
trade  regulation  rule  promulgated  by  the  FTC  or  that  violates  an  FTC  cease  and  desist  order. 
See  15  U.S.C.  §§ 45(l)  and  (m)(1)(A).  In  addition,  recognizing  the  importance  of  civil  penalties, 
Congress has specifically authorized the FTC to seek civil penalties for violations of certain stat-
utes, e.g., the FDCPA. 

43 15 U.S.C. § 56. 
44 If  the  Commission  brings  an  action  in  Federal  court  seeking  civil  penalties  for  violations 
of  the  laws  it  enforces,  the  agency  should  be  permitted  to  obtain  injunctive  relief  in  such  an 
action. In instances where there is a need to bring ongoing unlawful conduct by a financial serv-
ices provider to a swift halt to protect consumers, and where both equitable relief and civil pen-
alties  are  appropriate,  the  FTC  should  have  the  option  of  directly  filing  an  action  in  Federal 
court seeking both equitable relief and civil penalties.

own  civil  penalty  cases,  while  retaining  the  option  of  referring  appropriate  matters 
to  DOJ.46 Conferring  this  authority  on  the  Commission  also  would  increase  effi-
ciency.  Currently,  if  DOJ  declines  to  participate  in  the  name  of  the  United  States 
or otherwise fails to act within 45 days on such a referral, the Commission may file 
the  case  in  its  own  name.  This  process  requires  extra  time  and  delay,  even  under 
the best of circumstances. Moreover, once DOJ accepts a referral, the FTC normally 
assigns  one  or  more  of  its  staff  attorneys,  at  DOJ’s  request,  to  assist  in  litigating 
the  case.  Despite  excellent  relations  and  coordination,  the  use  of  personnel  at  two 
agencies inevitably creates delay and inefficiencies. This is particularly true in cases 
where  the  FTC  is  simply  referring  to  DOJ  a  civil  penalty  settlement  to  be  filed  in 
Federal court. 

The  FTC  Act  therefore  should  be  amended  to  expand  the  agency’s  independent 
litigating  authority  to  allow  the  FTC  to  bring  actions  for  civil  penalties  in  Federal 
court  ‘‘in  its  own  name  by  any  of  its  attorneys,’’  without  mandating  that  DOJ  have 
the  option  to  litigate  on  the  FTC’s  behalf,  as  is  currently  required  in  most  cases. 
C. Increase Vital Empirical Research 

One of the most challenging current policy issues in consumer protection is under 
what  circumstances  the  disclosure  of  information  allows  consumers  to  make  ade-
quately  informed  decisions  about  products,  including  financial  goods  and  services. 
The  FTC  has  long  recognized  that  the  disclosure  of  information  often  can  empower 
consumers,  but  that  such  disclosures  may  not  be  effective  in  some  circumstances. 
In  particular,  the  agency  has  recognized  the  challenges  of  conveying  information 
about  complex  products  and  topics  via  disclosures.  This  challenge  is  an  especially 
important one to address in the financial services area, because mortgage and credit 
products have become much more complex in recent years. 

Statutory  and  regulatory  schemes  related  to  financial  services  include  a  host  of 
requirements  mandating  that  information  be  disclosed  to  consumers.  Some  have 
questioned  whether  these  disclosures  provide  consumers  with  the  information  they 
need to properly understand the financial services they are purchasing. Specifically, 
some  have  argued  that  current  disclosure  requirements  are  inadequate  in  light  of 
the  advent  and  expansion  of  new  financial  services,  such  as  alternative  mortgages. 
The  Commission  has  a  long  history  of  conducting  empirical  tests  of  the  efficacy 
of disclosures in a wide variety of commercial contexts.47 Most recently, in 2007, the 
FTC’s Bureau of Economics published a seminal research report concluding that the 
current  mortgage  disclosure  requirements  do  not  work  and  that  alternative  disclo-
sures should be considered and tested.48 As policymakers assess the utility of disclo-
sures for financial products and services, the FTC has an opportunity to play a piv-
otal  role  in  the  debate.  The  Commission  has  the  experience  needed  to  conduct  reli-
able  studies  of  disclosures  and  report  the  results  of  these  studies  to  policymakers 
and the public to better inform the debate. Focusing more attention on and devoting 
more  resources  to  such  vital  empirical  work  is  needed  so  that  the  FTC  can  foster 
the development of sound consumer protection policy. 
D. Increase in Resources 

The  FTC  has  a  broad  consumer  protection  mission  that  extends  far  beyond  the 
financial  services  area,  protecting  consumers  from  identity  theft,  false  advertising, 
malware, business opportunity frauds, telemarketing fraud, and more. Over the past 
few  years,  the  Commission  has  responded  to  the  need  for  more  financial  services 

46 Other independent Federal agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the  Commodity  Futures  Trading  Commission,  are  able  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  their  own 
expertise by independently bringing administrative or judicial actions for civil penalties. 

47 In  2004,  for  example,  the  FTC  released  a  study  showing  that  broker  compensation  disclo-
sures  that  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  had  proposed  confused  con-
sumers,  leading  many  of  them  to  choose  loans  that  were  more  expensive.  See  Federal  Trade 
Commission,  Bureau  of  Economics  Staff  Report,  The  Effect  of  Mortgage  Broker  Compensation 
Disclosures on Consumers and Competition: A Controlled Experiment (February 2004). 

48 See  Federal  Trade  Commission,  Bureau  of  Economics  Staff  Report,  Improving  Consumer 
Mortgage  Disclosures:  An  Empirical  Assessment  of  Current  and  Prototype  Disclosure  Forms 
(June 2007), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2007/06/P025505mortgagedisclosurereport.pdf. 
In  this  empirical  study,  the  FTC  staff  tested  currently  required  mortgage  cost  disclosure  docu-
ments, as well as developed and tested a prototype mortgage cost disclosure document. The FTC 
staff  study  concluded  that  the  current  document  ‘‘failed  to  convey  key  mortgage  costs  to  many 
consumers,’’ while the prototype document ‘‘significantly improved consumer recognition of mort-
gage costs, demonstrating that better disclosures are feasible.’’ Id. at ES–1 and ES–5. Following 
up  on  this  research,  in  2008  the  FTC’s  Bureau  of  Economics  convened  a  conference  to  evaluate 
how  mortgage  disclosures  could  be  improved.  See  Federal  Trade  Commission,  ‘‘May  15,  2008

enforcement by shifting consumer protection resources to the financial services area 
to  the  fullest  extent  possible.  There  is  a  great  deal  more  that  the  FTC  can  accom-
plish in protecting consumers of financial services and we are prepared to do more. 
To accomplish this goal, the FTC needs significant additional professional staff. 
V. Conclusion 

The Commission is committed to protecting consumers throughout the credit life- 
cycle,  including  preventing  harm  to  the  many  American  consumers  who  struggle 
with mortgage, credit card, and other debt. The agency has used its traditional con-
sumer protection tools of law enforcement, broad-based research and policy develop-
ment, and consumer and business outreach to provide important protections for con-
sumers of financial services. However, the Commission must do more. To enable the 
FTC  to  perform  a  greater  and  more  effective  role  protecting  consumers  in  financial 
distress,  it  recommends  changes  in  the  law  and  resources  to  enhance  its  authority 
to promulgate needed rules and prosecute cases against law violators. The Commis-
sion  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the  FTC’s 
work and your consideration of its views. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you.  Thank  you  very  much,  Commis-

sioner. 

STATEMENT OF NANCY DIX, CONSUMER, 

ANSTED, WEST VIRGINIA 

I’m  very  proud  that  Nancy  Dix  is  here  this  morning.  I  really 
want to thank you for coming here, from coming up from West Vir-
ginia. It’s not far away, but it’s a long trip, isn’t it? 

Mrs. DIX. Yes, it is. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, it is. From what I understand from your tes-
timony  is  that  you  were  in  danger  of  losing  your  home  and  so  you 
turned to a company called, Mortgage Rescue. 

Mrs. DIX. Right. 
The CHAIRMAN. Is that correct? 
Mrs. DIX. Yes. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  it  doesn’t  sound  like  this  company  rescued 

you from anything. 

Mrs. DIX. They didn’t. 
The CHAIRMAN. In fact, it sounds like this mortgage rescue com-
pany  just  made  your  financial  situation  even  worse.  You  paid  this 
company $921 for their services. 

Mrs. DIX. Right. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  And  their  expert  advice  to  you  was  to  pay  the 

lender a $5,000 deposit to stop the foreclosure. Is that correct? 

Mrs. DIX. Yes. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Of  course  they  knew  that  you  couldn’t  afford  to 

make this payment. 

Mrs. DIX. Right. They knew it. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  So  Mrs.  Dix,  one  of  our  responsibilities  in  this 
committee  is  to  protect  consumers  against  fraud,  against  people 
who call you up. They contacted you on the telephone? 

Mrs. DIX. Through the mail. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Through  the  mail  and  you  were  looking  for  help 

and so you kind of, were eager to see what they had to say. 

Mrs. DIX. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. I don’t know all of the facts about your case, but 
it sounds to me like this company promised you something it knew 
it could never deliver to you. 

Mrs. DIX. Right.

The CHAIRMAN. Based on your experience can you give this Com-
mittee any guidance about what we can do to make sure that other 
families don’t have to go through what you have gone through? 

Mrs.  DIX.  Yes,  sir.  If  they’re  not  sure  about  a  company  like  that 

they need to come talk to our Attorney General. 

The CHAIRMAN. To the Attorney General? 
Mrs. DIX. Yes, of their state. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes,  and  in  this  case  that  worked  out  for  you, 

didn’t it? 

Mrs. DIX. Yes, it did. It kept me from losing my home. 
[The prepared statement of Mrs. Dix follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF NANCY DIX, CONSUMER, ANSTED, WEST VIRGINIA 

Good morning, my name is Nancy Dix. I am sixty-seven years old. I live in a dou-
ble-wide  manufactured  home  in  Ansted,  West  Virginia.  After  my  husband  died  of 
a heart attack in 2001, I was contacted by lenders to refinance my home with prom-
ises  of  saving  me  money.  My  husband  had  always  handled  things  like  loans  so  I 
did  not  know  much  about  mortgages  and  loans.  I  trusted  the  people  I  dealt  with 
because  I  thought  they  were  professionals  looking  out  for  my  best  interests.  I  later 
found out that I was actually being taken advantage of by predatory lenders. 

In  the  spring  of  2002  I  spoke  with  a  mortgage  broker  called  Infinity,  which  told 
me it would save me money. Infinity sent an appraiser out to my house and valued 
the  property  for  $97,000.  I  later  learned  that  it  was  actually  worth  about  $59,000. 
After  the  appraisal,  Infinity  told  me  a  man  would  be  coming  to  my  home  with 
papers  to  sign.  When  the  man  came,  I  learned  for  the  first  time  that  my  payments 
would be $800 a month. This is higher than what I was expecting and a lot for me 
to  afford  on  my  fixed  income.  I  asked  about  the  payments  and  was  told  that  in  a 
few  months,  they  would  lower  my  payments  to  $600.  The  signing  was  rushed,  and 
no  one  explained  the  papers  to  me.  I  admit  I  was  confused  by  all  that  paperwork 
and simply trusted that I was being treated honestly. 

The loan ended up with a bank called Flagstar. The total amount of the loan was 
for $86,700.00 with an APR of 9.481 percent. Under the loan I was required to make 
payments of over $245,000.00 over thirty years. 

After  the  signing  I  began  making  payments.  I  contacted  Flagstar  after  a  few 
months to lower my payments. Flagstar told me that I would have to come up with 
more  than  $8,000  out  of  my  pocket  before  they  would  lower  my  payment—money 
I  did  not  have.  I  struggled  to  make  payments  over  the  years  and  was  forced  ulti-
mately into bankruptcy. When I tried to catch up my payments with Flagstar, they 
wanted  me  to  pay  large  amounts  that  I  could  not  afford  on  my  fixed  income. 
Flagstar  wanted  me  to  pay  over  $1,800  a  month  when  my  income  was  only  about 
$2,000. Also, Flagstar force placed expensive insurance on my account, which made 
me further behind and increased my monthly payment. 

In  July  2005,  Flagstar  started  sending  my  payments  back  to  me.  Eventually,  my 

home was sent into foreclosure, with a sale set for December 15, 2005. 

Around  this  time  I  was  contacted  by  an  outfit  from  Houston,  Texas,  called  Mort-
gage  Rescue.  They  told  me  to  send  them  some  information  about  my  finances  and 
$921 and they would stop the foreclosure. So on November 8, 2005, I sent them the 
information  and  money.  They  responded  to  me  by  a  letter  I  received  only  days  be-
fore  the  foreclosure.  The  letter  said  for  me  to  call  Flagstar  and  work  out  a  forbear-
ance  agreement,  but  I  would  have  to  pay  the  total  amount  I  was  behind  and  a 
$5,000  deposit  to  Flagstar  to  stop  the  foreclosure.  Mortgage  Rescue  knew  I  did  not 
have this money. I could have worked out this deal with Flagstar at anytime, with-
out  sending  Mortgage  Rescue  $921.  Basically  they  took  my  money  for  nothing.  I 
later found out that Mortgage Rescue was not even licensed to do business in West 
Virginia. I never got my money back from them. 

Luckily, I was able to call the West Virginia Attorney General, who had the fore-
closure put off. I was then sent to Mountain State Justice, a non-profit legal services 
office, and they worked it out so I could keep my home. 

If I had not called the Attorney General or found Mountain State Justice, I would 
have  lost  my  home.  I  would  be  in  my  late  sixties,  retired,  widowed,  with  nowhere 
to  live.  I  think  at  times  about  other  people  who  sent  their  hard-earned  money  to 
scam  artists  like  Mortgage  Rescue.  I  hope  you  are  able  to  do  something  to  prevent 
these crooks from taking advantage of people who are desperate, like I was, because 
they are facing loss of their homes. Thank you.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Let  me  now  go  on  to  Professor  Cox  before  my 

time runs out. Nothing is clicking here. Is the clock running? 

MALE SPEAKER. I think they’ve reset it, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, that’s not proper. Professor Cox according to 
your testimony, Mrs. Dix’s experience is disturbingly common. You 
say  it’s  difficult  for  consumers  to  get  objective  information  when 
they fall behind on their loan payments. They’re in danger of losing 
their homes. 

Why is it so difficult for people to find the assistance that might 

keep them in their homes? 

STATEMENT OF PRENTISS COX, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF 
CLINICAL LAW, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA LAW SCHOOL 
Mr.  COX.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  difficult  because  they 
get  bombarded  with  solicitations  promising  the  homeowner  that 
the  family  will  be  safe  from  foreclosure  by  signing  up  with  this 
white knight who is going to take care of the problem. 

And  if  you’re  looking  for  an  area  where  there’s  a  problem  with 
consumer  protection?  Try  to  find  something  where’s  there’s  lots  of 
money,  complexity  of  a  transaction  and/or  vulnerability  of  the  con-
sumer. Foreclosure rescue fraud pins the meter on absolutely every 
one of those items. 

So you’ve got desperate homeowners who are trying their best to 
save their homes, their largest investment, often all they have. And 
we’re  dealing  with  an  extremely  complex  transaction.  So  it’s  dif-
ficult to sort out what’s right and what’s wrong when you’re in that 
position. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  OK.  I  went  out  of  order  there  deliberately  be-
cause  I  wanted  to  be  able  to  ask  Nancy  some  questions  before  I 
have  to  go  down  and  vote  at  which  point  I  will  then  turn  it  over 
to Senator Lautenberg. I will go vote and will come back. This hap-
pens  often  on  the  Committee.  And  it’s  not  particularly  wonderful, 
but it’s the way at least we can keep the testimony going. 

So  maybe  what  I  should  do,  Mr.  Cox,  is  just  to  ask  you  to  give 

your testimony. 

Mr. COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be extremely brief. I un-

derstand the time pressures. 

The CHAIRMAN. No, don’t worry about that. 
Mr. COX. OK. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  We  don’t  have  that.  We  just  have  a  vote.  That’s 

different. Small pressure. 

Mr.  COX.  There  are  two  types  of  scams  here  that  we’re  dealing 
with.  The  one  that  Mrs.  Dix  was  taken  advantage  of  is  called  a 
foreclosure  consultant  and  other  similar  names.  That  has  become 
more popular with the change in the market lately. 

The  other  kind  is  called  a  foreclosure  reconveyance.  And  that’s 
where  the  homeowner  is  in  foreclosure  and  has  equity  in  their 
home  and  they  are  convinced  to  give  a  title  to  the  property  to  a 
scam  artist  who  is  going  to  save  the  house.  The  scam  artist  then 
gives back some sort of interest to the homeowner, typically a land 
sale  contract  or  a  lease  with  purchase  option.  That’s  called  a  fore-
closure reconveyance scam. 

I had the privilege of doing all the major predatory lending cases 
with the state attorney generals in the national leadership, wheth-

er it was First Alliance Mortgage, Household or Ameriquest, for 10 
years.  During  that  time,  about  2002–2003,  we  began  to  see  home-
owners  who  were  coming  in  who  were  in  foreclosure  and  didn’t 
know why they were being told that they could be evicted from the 
home  they  thought  they  owned.  Well,  these  were  reconveyance 
scams. 

The market, if you will, for that kind of reconveyance scam in the 
early  2000s  existed  because  there  was  a  historic,  incredible  appre-
ciation of home values, which meant that the majority of people in 
foreclosure had equity in their homes, sometimes really substantial 
equity  in  their  homes.  And  these  scams  flourished  during  that  pe-
riod.  Since  that  time  I  don’t  think  you  need  to  look  at  the  graphs 
that were attached to my testimony to know that home values have 
plummeted. 

I hope you do look at the foreclosure graph because even though 

you all know it, it is unbelievable. It looks like a hockey stick. 

And  when  you  look  at  it  on  isolated,  regional  areas,  you’re  just 
floored.  In  Hennepin  County,  which  is  the  county  including  Min-
neapolis and the suburbs, there was a very steady 20-year average. 
It’s  up  nine  times.  I  mean  we’re  talking  an  unbelievable  explosion 
in foreclosures that has devastated communities. 

As the market shifted and housing values plummeted, the equity 
disappeared  from  many  of  those  transactions.  So  even  though  we 
have nine times more homeowners than foreclosure, the number of 
people  with  equity  is  much  lower,  but  still  exists.  And  those  re-
conveyance scams are still going on. 

During  the  last  year  or  two,  there  is  an  increasing  prominence 
of  the  kinds  of  scams  that  Mrs.  Dix  fell  victim  to,  which  is  these 
foreclosure  consultant  scam.  In  2004  in  Minnesota,  we  got  ahead 
of  this  curve  and  passed  a  state  law  dealing  with  the  foreclosure 
consultants,  which  was  modeled  on  an  old  California  law.  And  we 
invented  from  scratch  a  law  to  attempt  to  regulate  reconveyance 
transactions. 

It  has  been  very  successful.  And  it  has  been  adopted  in  almost 

20 states now. And another 15 states have it pending. 

These  state  laws  work.  In  my  experience  working  on  predatory 
lending, back when I had to explain to people what subprime mort-
gages were, and back to when I was a really bad dinner table con-
versation  because  I  was  saying,  you  don’t  realize  how  bad  this  is, 
people. This is disaster brewing. It was like, yes, yes, shut up. 

Back  in  those  days,  at  the  state  level  we  were  doing  almost  all 
the work on this. We got some support from agencies like the FTC. 
But  we  actually  had  to  fight  the  Federal  Government  and  particu-
larly the OCC, the Office of Controller of the Currency, the OTS— 
the depository regulatory agencies. In fact, I had a case where they 
filed an amicus brief against us where the data was overwhelming 
about the fraud. 

So the first thing I would say in terms of what the Federal Gov-
ernment  can  do  here  is  don’t  preempt  the  states.  The  states  are 
working really hard on this. We were way out in front on this. 

We’ve  passed  laws.  We’re  attempting  to  solve  the  problem.  Fed-
eral  preemption  on  the  subprime  mortgages  was  really,  really  not 
helpful  in  attacking  that  problem  when  we  were  trying  to  do  it  at 
the state level.

19 

The second thing I would say in terms of what the Federal Gov-
ernment  can  do  to  help  attack  these  scams  is  I  support  Commis-
sioner  Harbour’s  testimony.  The  FTC  works  very  well  with  state 
attorney  generals.  In  fact  when  I  walked  in  I  saw  some  familiar 
faces here from the FTC from those days. 

But the FTC, to move quickly to attack scams as opposed to more 
delicate  policy  questions  and  established  industries,  needs  swifter 
authority.  They  need  to  get  more  of  a  cop  mentality  when  it’s  a 
scam,  and  it’s  not  a  complicated  policy  issue.  And  they  need  that 
APA  rulemaking  authority  and  not  that  cumbersome  Magnuson- 
Moss authority. 

And then finally two other quick things. First, fund of legal serv-
ices.  At  our  local  level  we  established  a  committee  of  people  that 
had a very effective public/private partnership. And the legal serv-
ice attorneys were at the fore in taking cases like Mrs. Dix and oth-
ers and resolving the problems. 

And  second,  there  is  a  possibility  to  adopt  an  analogous  federal 
law  to  the  state  foreclosure  consultant  laws  that  would  set  a  floor, 
not  a  ceiling,  a  floor,  to  protect  consumers  who  are  subject  to  that 
type  of  solicitation.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify,  Mr. 
Chairman and Members of the Committee. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Cox follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PRENTISS COX, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL LAW, 

UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA LAW SCHOOL 

Thank  you,  Chairman  Rockefeller  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  including  my 
home  state  Senator  Amy  Klobuchar,  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  Nation’s 
consumer  protection  agenda  in  the  wake  of  this  great  flood  of  foreclosures.  While 
there is much to say about why we have a human-made disaster of this proportion, 
millions  of  American  families  are  just  desperately  trying  to  cope  with  the  reality  of 
default or foreclosure on their mortgage loans, or are worried about looming difficul-
ties in meeting their mortgage payments. I will try to address the unfair and decep-
tive  practices  targeting  homeowners  in  foreclosure  and  how  government  can  help 
protect these families in a time of intense distress. 

Prior  to  joining  the  University  of  Minnesota  Law  School  faculty  in  2005,  I  had 
the privilege of working as an Assistant Attorney General and Manager of the Con-
sumer Enforcement Division in the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office. A primary 
focus of my work in that Office was combating mortgage fraud and attacking preda-
tory  conduct  against  homeowners  in  foreclosure.  Along  with  my  colleagues  Giulia 
Palumbo and Julie Aoki-Ralston, I worked with homeowners in foreclosure who had 
succumbed  to  solicitations  promising  to  save  their  homes.  These  homeowners  often 
faced  eviction  as  a  result  of  complicated  and  frequently  fraudulent  transactions.  In 
2004,  we  helped  draft  legislation  enacted  by  the  Minnesota  legislature  designed  to 
regulate these foreclosure rescue scams. Since that time, I have worked with numer-
ous state legislators and consumer advocates seeking to pass similar legislation and 
with  legal  aid  and  other  attorneys  engaged  in  litigation  to  help  foreclosed  home-
owners. 

I also have been asked to appear before you on behalf of the National Association 
of Consumer Advocates (NACA), a non-profit association of consumer law attorneys 
and  consumer  advocates.  NACA  members  include  attorneys  from  a  variety  of  types 
of  practice,  including  the  public  sector,  legal  services,  fee-generating  attorneys  and 
the academy. NACA is a remarkable efficient and strong advocate for the protection 
of consumers in the marketplace. 
I. Anatomy of Foreclosure Rescue Scams 

Foreclosure  rescue  scams  target  homeowners  at  their  most  vulnerable  moment. 
Perpetrators of these scams use fraud and false promises to take desperately needed 
cash from these homeowners. 
A. Experience of Homeowners Entering Foreclosure 

If  you  want  to  find  an  area  ripe  for  consumer  fraud,  look  for  one  or  more  of  the 
following three factors: substantial amounts of money at stake; complexity of trans-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

20 

actions;  and  vulnerability  of  the  consumer.  Families  in  foreclosure  present  all  of 
these characteristics in one place. The largest and most important investment made 
by  the  typical  American  family  is  their  home.  It  is  almost  impossible  to  find  a  con-
sumer  transaction  more  complex  than  the  financing  and  legal  obstacles  facing  a 
family  in  foreclosure.  And  these  families  often  are  desperate  to  save  their  homes. 
Foreclosure  rescue  scams  provide  a  ready-made  opportunity  for  the  perpetrators 
of scams because the potential victims appear in the public record of foreclosure fil-
ings, and critical information such as estimated home value and the amount of liens 
on  the  property  also  are  readily  available  in  the  public  record  or  on  the  Internet. 
As  soon  as  a  house  enters  the  foreclosure  process,  the  homeowner  in  foreclosure 
typically is subject to an avalanche of mail, phone calls and personal visits from peo-
ple promising to help the homeowner. 

It  is  difficult  to  describe  the  desperation  felt  by  many  homeowners  with  whom  I 
have  worked  who  were  facing  the  loss  of  their  homes  through  foreclosure.  My  col-
leagues and I worked with one family that had three small children and their home 
had been passed through two prior generations of the family. I recall another home-
owner  who  had  personally  built  most  of  his  home.  He  and  his  wife  and  children 
were  evicted  by  a  foreclosure  rescue  buyer  on  Christmas  Eve.  We  were  eventually 
able  to  help  them  regain  possession  of  the  home.  More  than  one  homeowner  with 
whom we worked succumbed to the stress of the foreclosure process. 
B. Two Types of Foreclosure Rescue Operations 

The  individuals  and  companies  that  descend  on  homeowners  in  foreclosure  have 
a common theme of purporting to help the homeowner ‘‘save your home’’ and ending 
the  nightmare  of  foreclosure.  Acquirers  claim  to  have  special  expertise  to  help  the 
homeowner resolve the foreclosure. A typical solicitation letter is as follows: 
We lookout for your interests. 
We can stop the foreclosure process. 
We can help you restore your credit. 
We can help you save your homestead. 
. . . Let us try and help you figure out solutions so you can sleep at night.1 

Many  foreclosure  rescue  operations  also  rely  heavily  on  affinity  appeals,  such  as 

race or religious similarity. 

Foreclosure  rescue  operations  can  be  grouped  into  two  broad  categories:  fore-

closure reconveyance transactions and foreclosure ‘‘consultants.’’ 
1. Foreclosure Reconveyance Transactions 

Foreclosure reconveyance transactions involve the transfer of title from the home-
owner  in  foreclosure  to  a  ‘‘purchaser’’  and  an  alleged  second  transfer,  or  reconvey-
ance, of an ownership interest back to the homeowner. There are several variations 
of  this  type  of  reconveyance  deal.2 In  some  instances,  the  ‘‘purchaser’’  promises  to 
return  ownership  to  the  homeowner  through  a  land  sale  contract  or  a  lease  with 
purchase  option.  Other  forms  of  the  reconveyance  scheme  involve  a  third  party 
‘‘white  knight’’  who  takes  title  to  the  home  and  promises  to  complete  the  reconvey-
ance to the homeowner. 

A  substantial  number  of  these  transactions  involve  outright  fraud.  Forged  signa-
tures  on  deeds,  blatantly  false  representations  about  the  character  of  documents 
presented  for  signature  by  the  homeowner,  and  false  statements  that  the  deal  is 
really  a  mortgage  refinancing  are  common  in  these  transactions.  For  example,  I 
worked with a Saint Paul, Minnesota family in foreclosure who were told that they 
would  receive  a  mortgage  loan  refinancing.  The  person  soliciting  them  referred  the 
family  to  a  company  representative  who  gave  them  a  business  card  stating  ‘‘loan 
administrator’’  and  an  appraiser  was  sent  to  the  home.  In  reality,  the  person  con-
ducting  the  scam  fraudulently  obtained  a  warranty  deed  from  the  family  by  telling 
them  that  the  documents  they  were  being  asked  to  sign  were  paperwork  to  get  the 
refinancing  loan  started.  Without  the  family’s  knowledge,  the  perpetrator  of  this 
scheme transferred the property to a third party who obtained a mortgage loan that

provided cash to the perpetrator. The family was told the refinancing was complete 
and they even made a few payments to the perpetrator before they received a ‘‘rent’’ 
demand  from  the  third  party  who  purportedly  held  title  to  the  home.  After  many 
difficult  months  for  the  family  and  countless  hours  of  investigation  and  litigation, 
we were able to have the title restored to the family. 

Many  of  these  reconveyance  transactions,  however,  do  not  involve  such  blatant 
fraud—the foreclosed homeowner knows that some sort of reconveyance transaction 
is  occurring.  But  these  deals  are  designed  to  fail  for  the  homeowner.  The  perpetra-
tors  of  the  schemes  use  the  desperate  hopes  of  the  homeowner  combined  with  mis-
leading promises about future refinancing opportunities, or the like, to obtain agree-
ment  to  complex  transactions  that  would  be  hard  to  grasp  for  most  average  home-
owners even in the best of circumstances. Unlike the type of loan modification that 
makes  sense  for  these  homeowners,  based  on  the  principles  of  restructuring  pay-
ments cognizant of the payment ability of the homeowner, foreclosure reconveyance 
almost  invariably  increase  the  homeowner’s  monthly  payment  over  the  payment 
amount that led to foreclosure. One missed payment means the deal is quickly can-
celed and the home is gone. 

The loss of homeowner equity in these reconveyance transactions can be substan-
tial. The typical loss in these deals exceeds $20,000, in my experience. Some victims, 
such as elderly homeowners with modest mortgages, have lost in excess of $100,000. 
Foreclosure  reconveyance  transactions  occur  partly  because  these  deals  almost 
never  involve  cash  investment  by  the  ‘‘purchaser’’  in  the  foreclosed  property.  The 
‘‘purchaser’’  simply  takes  title  to  the  property  from  the  homeowner,  or  arranges  for 
a  third  party  to  take  title.  Once  title  is  transferred,  the  ‘‘purchaser’’  or  third  party 
title  holder  obtains  a  mortgage  refinance  loan  and  pulls  cash  out  of  the  property. 
So there is an up-front pay-off for these actors. After the homeowner is evicted, the 
perpetrators  of  the  scheme  sell  the  home  and  may  profit  from  a  ‘‘back-end’’  of  the 
deal, as well. 
2. Foreclosure Consultants 

The  other  type  of  foreclosure  rescue  operation  involves  solicitation  of  foreclosed 
homeowners  by  ‘‘consultants’’  who  promise  to  assist  the  homeowner  in  negotiating 
a  resolution  of  the  problem  with  the  foreclosing  lender.  The  foreclosed  homeowner 
has  to  pay  a  substantial  advance  fee  for  these  services,  usually  about  a  thousand 
dollars or more. While the monetary loss to these homeowners is not as substantial 
as with the reconveyance transactions, a four figure sum of money usually is a crit-
ical amount for homeowners trying to maintain control of their homes and pay other 
debts. 

Unlike  foreclosure  reconveyance  scams,  there  are  many  worthwhile  providers  of 
foreclosure prevention services who offer important help to homeowners attempting 
to  evaluate  the  difficult  choices  presented  by  the  initiation  of  a  foreclosure  pro-
ceeding.  The  non-profit  organizations  affiliated  with  the  National  Federation  of 
Credit  Counselors,  for  example,  have  an  excellent  reputation  for  providing  advice 
and services to mortgagors and other consumers in debt. 

Yet  deceptive  and  unfair  conduct  is  pervasive  in  this  area.3 As  discussed  below, 
state  attorneys  general  have  brought  dozens  of  actions  against  foreclosure  consult-
ants since the onset of the foreclosure crisis. Some of these companies just disappear 
with  the  money.  Even  when  the  company  is  not  a  complete  sham,  the  services  pro-
vided  often  are  of  little  use  to  the  homeowner  and  the  outcomes  promised  at  the 
time  of  solicitation  are  illusory.  Better,  affordable  services  generally  are  available 
to foreclosed homeowners through legitimate non-profit counselors. 

Foreclosure  consultants  thus  present  a  very  similar  regulatory  problem  to  debt 
settlement  services.  While  the  underlying  service  is  useful,  often  vitally  important, 
the  degree  of  fraud  and  misleading  promises  in  the  industry  make  it  likely  that  a 
homeowner  who  pays  up-front  for  these  services  will  be  losing  cash  desperately 
needed to manage the foreclosure process or its aftermath. 
II. The Changing Reality of Foreclosures and the Market For Rescue Scams 
Consumer  protection  regulators  and  advocates  began  to  see  a  sharp  rise  in  fore-
closure reconveyance scams in the early 2000s. A wave of problems with foreclosure 
consultants  appeared  later,  rising  concurrently  with  the  foreclosure  crisis  that  be-
came apparent within the last 3 years. This shifting pattern is largely explained by 
the gyrations in the real estate market. 

Attached  as  Exhibit  A  to  this  testimony  is  a  graph  of  median  home  prices  over 
the  last  twenty  years.  You  probably  don’t  have  to  look  to  know  what  it  shows.

Steady but slow appreciation gave way in the late 1990s to an ahistoric, sharp rise 
in  home  prices,  followed  by  a  crash  in  values  starting  in  mid-2006.  This  pattern, 
likely  not  coincidentally,  closely  mirrors  the  explosion  and  collapse  of  nonprime 
mortgage lending.4 

The  graph  of  foreclosures  attached  as  Exhibit  B,  on  the  other  hand,  looks  like  a 
hockey stick. Foreclosures began a slow rise through the 1980s and 1990s, then rose 
exponentially  starting  in  2005.  While  we  all  understand  this  pattern,  the  rapidity 
and height of this foreclosure explosion is startling. 

Putting  this  information  together  explains  the  change  in  the  most  common  type 
of  foreclosure  rescue  scam.  The  ‘‘market’’  for  perpetrators  of  foreclosure  reconvey-
ance  transactions  was  as  ripe  as  it  may  ever  be  in  the  early  to  mid  2000s.  Fore-
closures  were  slightly  higher  than  the  historic  average,  but  foreclosed  homeowners 
owned  properties  that  had  substantially  appreciated  since  the  loan  in  foreclosure 
was  originated,  and  their  properties  were  continuing  to  appreciate  almost  by  the 
month. 

Therefore,  the  number  of  homeowners  in  foreclosure  with  substantial  equity  in 
the  property  was  at  an  historic  high  during  the  early  2000s.  This  is  the  necessary 
condition  for  a  foreclosure  reconveyance  transaction  to  yield  proceeds  to  the  perpe-
trator  of  the  deal.  The  purchaser  obtains  an  upfront  payment  from  the  deal  only 
if there is sufficient equity to yield proceeds after the purchaser closes on his or her 
mortgage  loan.  During  the  high  tide  of  foreclosure  reconveyance  transactions,  the 
inappropriately  loose  underwriting  criteria  of  most  lenders  and  the  failure  of  self- 
regulation  by  appraisers  and  others  involved  in  real  estate  settlement  services  con-
tributed to the ease of completing foreclosure reconveyance transactions. 

Conversely,  the  current  environment  is  ideal  for  foreclosure  consultant  schemes. 
Foreclosure  consultants  thrive  when  the  number  of  foreclosures  is  high  and  when 
foreclosed  homeowners  feel  that  they  have  few  options  for  dealing  with  the  situa-
tion.  Plummeting  real  estate  values  have  left  the  overwhelming  majority  of  home-
owners in foreclosure with negative equity. Credit markets have tightened in many 
sectors, but have all but disappeared for foreclosed homeowners. Various public sec-
tor and industry pronouncements about purported loan modification programs have 
added  to  confusion  on  the  part  of  foreclosure  homeowners  about  their  available  op-
tions.  In  this  situation,  foreclosed  homeowners  are  ripe  for  ‘‘consultants’’  promising 
big results while demanding upfront payment. 
III. Consumer Protection Enforcement with Foreclosure Rescue Scams 

Consumer protection regulation is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It is essential 
to  tailor  the  regulatory  requirements  to  the  problem  at  hand.  The  problem  of  fore-
closure  rescue  scams  presents  a  challenge  of  drafting  appropriate  substantive  re-
strictions  on  the  conduct  and  ensuring  that  enforcement  of  those  laws  is  effective 
and efficient. State legislatures and state attorneys general have already taken sig-
nificant steps in addressing these issues. 
A. The Right Tool for This Job: State Laws Attacking Foreclosure Rescue Scams 

The Federal Trade Commission (‘‘FTC’’) and multiple states have used their broad 
UDAP  (unfair  and  deceptive  acts  and  practices)  authority  to  attack  the  problem  of 
foreclosure  rescue  scams.  Starting  in  the  early  2000s,  state  attorneys  general 
brought  a  series  of  UDAP  actions  against  entities  engaged  in  foreclosure  reconvey-
ance  schemes.5 When  the  foreclosure  crisis  spawned  a  flood  of  foreclosure  consult-
ants,  state  attorneys  general  brought  UDAP  cases  against  these  parties.6 More  re-
cently,  the  FTC  has  initiated  multiple  legal  actions  against  deceptive  foreclosure 
consultant conduct.7 

One disadvantage of UDAP cases is that they usually require extensive investiga-
tion and resources to prosecute. States have tackled this problem by enacting legis-
lation to restrict the conduct of foreclosure purchasers in reconveyance transactions

and  restrict  the  behavior  of  foreclosure  consultants.  In  2004,  Minnesota  enacted  a 
law  regulating  both  types  of  foreclosure  rescue  scams.  Maryland  enacted  this  law 
in 2005, followed by New York and Illinois in 2006. Massachusetts and the District 
of  Columbia  have  regulations  prohibiting  foreclosure  reconveyance  transactions. 
Today,  more  than  20  states  have  laws  regarding  foreclosure  rescue  scams,  the  vast 
majority based on the Minnesota model. See Exhibit C (listing state foreclosure res-
cue scam laws). 

The  key  to  the  Minnesota  model  law  regulating  foreclosure  reconveyance  trans-
actions is substantive restrictions on the deals. The foreclosure purchaser must have 
verified  proof  that  the  homeowner  in  foreclosure  has  the  ability  to  pay  for  the  land 
sale  contract  or  purchase  option  required  for  the  reconveyance  end  of  the  trans-
action.  If  the  deal  fails  to  result  in  the  return  of  title  to  the  property  to  the  fore-
closed  homeowner,  the  law  requires  payment  by  the  purchaser  to  the  foreclosed 
homeowner if total consideration paid to the homeowner is 82 percent or less of the 
home’s value. The law has numerous other protections, including a required formal 
closing of the transaction and an extended right to cancel the deal.8 

State foreclosure consultant laws also attack the core of that problem. The crucial 
protection  in  this  part  of  the  state  foreclosure  rescue  scam  laws  is  a  prohibition  on 
the  foreclosure  consultant  receiving  ‘‘. . .  any  compensation  until  after  the  fore-
closure  consultant  has  fully  performed  each  and  every  service  the  foreclosure  con-
sultant contracted to perform or represented he or she would perform.’’ This require-
ment obviously provides simple recourse against the scammer who just takes money 
and  never  promises  the  service.  This  requirement  also  puts  the  homeowner  in  con-
trol of whether to pay foreclosure consultants who perform far fewer or less effective 
services than promised. 

These  state  foreclosure  rescue  scam  laws  provide  state  attorneys  general  and 
other  state  enforcement  entities  with  an  efficient  and  swift  means  of  attacking  the 
rescue  scam  problem.  States  that  have  brought  actions  against  foreclosure  rescue 
scams  in  the  last  few  years  have  relied  primarily  on  violations  of  the  express  re-
quirements of these statutes rather than having to prove UDAP violations.9 

Enacting  these  laws  clearly  did  not  eradicate  the  problem  of  foreclosure  rescue 
scams. Enforcement resources rarely are sufficient to stop every violator of the law. 
Of  course,  the  entities  conducting  these  scams  purposefully  or  inadvertently  find 
loopholes  in  the  law,  which  has  led  states  to  evolve  these  laws  to  adapt  to  the 
changing patterns of the rescue perpetrators. Yet the laws put the right tools in the 
hands  of  state  consumer  protection  enforcement  authorities  to  efficiently  pursue 
most foreclosure rescue fraud scams. State attorneys general retain UDAP authority 
as a basis for action against any exceptional conduct. 

In  addition  to  public  enforcement  actions,  numerous  private  attorneys  have  con-
tributed  substantially  to  helping  foreclosed  homeowners  caught  in  rescue  scams. 
Most of these laws also include a private right of action so that homeowners in fore-
closure  have  remedies  to  recover  losses  suffered  in  these  transactions.  The  size  of 
the  loses  with  foreclosure  reconveyance  transactions,  combined  with  the  existence 
of  an  immovable  asset  that  cannot  be  moved  beyond  the  reach  of  the  homeowner’s 
attorney, have made it possible for private attorneys to effectively utilize these laws 
in  many  cases.10 Legal  services  attorneys  have  been  on  the  forefront  of  this  work. 
Many  of  the  earliest  cases  attacking  foreclosure  reconveyance  transactions,  for  ex-
ample,  were  brought  by  local  legal  aid  offices  attempting  to  help  seniors  and  other 
homeowners who had lost control of their homes and their home equity. 

In  Minnesota,  we  have  established  a  highly  successful  collaborative  approach  to 
attacking  these  scams.  The  Minnesota  Equity  Stripping  Task  Force  was  organized 
in  2003  by  the  Volunteer  Lawyer’s  Network  (VLN)  and  Mid-Minnesota  Legal  Serv-
ices. Task Force membership includes local legal services attorneys, pro bono attor-
neys,  private  attorneys  handling  cases  for  a  fee  and  representatives  of  public  agen-

cies.  Cases  are  accepted  by  an  appropriate  Task  Force  member  based  on  legal  aid 
income eligibility, the potential for fee generation and the concerns of public enforce-
ment  agencies.  The  2004  Minnesota  foreclosure  rescue  scam  law  has  been  used  ef-
fectively by attorneys on the Task Force to assist homeowners victimized by preda-
tory foreclosure reconveyance deals. 
B.  A  Lesson  from  Federal  and  State  Consumer  Protection  Enforcement  Relating  to 

Mortgage Origination 

An  analysis  of  the  past  failure  of  the  regulatory  system  to  control  problems  in 
mortgage origination is beyond the scope of this testimony. But one lesson from this 
failure is directly relevant to confronting the problems for consumers resulting from 
the  current  credit  crisis.  We  need  to  use  all  the  resources,  talents  and  creativity  of 
both  state  and  Federal  authorities.  Accordingly,  there  is  no  place  for  Federal  pre-
emption of state consumer protections and state enforcement efforts. 

The explosive rise of abusive nonprime mortgage lending in 1998 was not accom-
panied by a substantial enforcement reaction from public regulatory authorities. The 
exception was a small group of state attorneys general and state financial regulators 
who pursued a series of cases against the largest of the nonprime mortgage origina-
tors—First  Alliance  Mortgage  Corporation  (state  actions  from  1998–2005),  House-
hold  International  (state  investigations  and  action  in  2001–2002)  and  Ameriquest 
Mortgage Corporation (state investigations and actions in 2003–2006). 

It is not a coincidence that state entities with a central consumer protection focus 
were  the  only  public  agencies  that  made  substantial  efforts  to  identify  and  address 
rampantly  imprudent  mortgage  lending  practices  in  the  period  from  1998  through 
2006.  These  consumer  protection  enforcement  actions  typically  arise  from  observa-
tions  and  reflected  experience  of  individuals  who  work  closely  with  consumers  who 
are in distress. In the case of nonprime lending, consumer protection regulators re-
ceived complaints showing a pattern of mortgage loans whose terms revealed a dis-
connection  between  cost  and  risk,  and  in  which  homeowners  repeatedly  expressed 
misperception  of  the  actual  terms  of  the  mortgage.  These  state  entities  receive  and 
evaluate large volumes of complaints by borrowers, and have expertise in analyzing 
such  data  for  patterns  of  conduct.  The  more  aggressive  state  agencies  also  have 
close ties to credit counselors, legal aid organizations and other public interest orga-
nizations  who  reflect  the  experience  of  an  even  larger  number  of  borrowers.  State 
actions  against  nonprime  mortgage  lenders  were  brought  despite  limited  resources, 
limited  legal  authority,  and  a  wide  range  of  competing  consumer  protection  con-
cerns. 

Federal entities with authority to establish rules for residential mortgage origina-
tion, especially the Federal Reserve Board, made little or no contribution to attack-
ing  the  problems  in  nonprime  origination.  Federal  banking  regulators  were  worse 
than idle. They actively impeded state actions by expansively interpreting their au-
thority to preempt state consumer protection laws and declaring that state agencies 
had  no  authority  to  enforce  non-preempted  state  laws  as  to  federally-chartered  fi-
nancial institutions or even operating subsidiaries of those institutions.11 

The FTC, which has a positive history of cooperating with state attorneys general 
in UDAP enforcement, did not take a leadership role in confronting mortgage origi-
nation abuse by nonbank institutions. 

A constructive Federal role in tackling consumer problems arising from the credit 
crisis  should  recognize  the  importance  of  fully  empowering  state  consumer  protec-
tion  enforcement  efforts  and  the  creative  learning  potential  from  allowing  states  to 
experiment with varied approaches to regulating unfair and deceptive practices. 
C. Possible Federal Action on Foreclosure Rescue Scams 

There are numerous options for Federal action related to this problem. Examining 
the  problem  of  foreclosure  rescue  scams  offers  an  opportunity  to  review  the  tools 
and  resources  available  to  the  FTC.  While  FTC  UDAP  authority  can  be  and  has 
been brought to bear on the problem, the experience of the states is that regulation 
aimed  directly  at  this  conduct  is  more  efficient  than  treating  each  case  as  a  new 
UDAP  investigation.  The  FTC  began  to  bring  actions  against  these  scams  substan-
tially after state attorneys general had attacked the problem and after state legisla-
tures had developed statutory restriction on their operation. 

Current FTC rule-making on UDAP matters is restricted to cumbersome and slow 
Magnuson-Moss  procedures.  Foreclosure  rescue  scams  are  prolific  in  number  and 
often  rapidly  adapt  solicitation  strategies.  Reform  of  FTC  rule-making  authority  to

make it more flexible and prompt would allow for a stronger and more effective Fed-
eral response to this and similar consumer protection problems.

The Federal Government also can support proven, effective work by legal services 
attorneys  that  have  been  the  front  line  of  defense  for  embattled  homeowners. 
Unwinding  or  otherwise  providing  remedies  for  individual  homeowners  subject  to 
foreclosure rescue scams, especially reconveyance transactions, can require substan-
tial  legal  resources.  In  many  situations,  these  are  not  cases  that  fee-generating  at-
torneys are likely to undertake. Legal services attorneys have been a reliable source 
of assistance for victims of rescue scams. A substantial number of the early warning 
cases in this area were brought by legal services attorneys. 

Congressional legislation could assist with controlling foreclosure rescue scams in 
at  least  two  areas.  First,  a  Federal  law  patterned  on  the  state  laws  that  have  ad-
dressed these issues could be helpful for both FTC enforcement actions and by pro-
viding  recourse  for  state  enforcement  agencies  and  individuals  in  states  lacking  a 
foreclosure rescue regulatory scheme. It may prove more difficult, though not impos-
sible,  to  enact  Federal  foreclosure  reconveyance  restrictions  because  they  are  more 
closely  tied  to  state  real  property  regimes.  Foreclosure  consultant  regulation,  how-
ever,  is  clearly  amenable  to  Federal  action.  In  terms  of  coordinated  Federal  and 
state  regulations,  this  type  of  law  could  be  similar  to  the  relationship  between  the 
Federal  Credit  Repair  Organizations  Act  (CROA)  and  state  credit  services  laws.  As 
noted  above,  it  would  be  crucial  to  ensure  that  any  Federal  law  sets  a  floor  on  the 
conduct of foreclosure consultants, rather than preempting in any way state protec-
tions or enforcement efforts. 

Second,  and  of  less  current  importance,  Congress  could  consider  clarifying  that 
foreclosure  reconveyance  transactions,  including  sale-leaseback  arrangements,  are 
clearly  within  the  scope  of  the  Home  Ownership  Equity  Protection  Act  (‘‘HOEPA’’). 
Current  HOEPA  language  and  rules  make  this  result  possible,  but  not  certain,  de-
pending on the structure of the reconveyance transaction. 
IV. Conclusion 

Foreclosure  rescue  scams  can  be  constrained  by  concerted  efforts  at  the  Federal 
and  state  level.  Distressed  homeowners  deserve  a  government  response  to  rescue 
scams better than the largely unregulated approach to mortgage lending that helped 
create  the  reality  of  an  extraordinary  number  of  foreclosures  facing  America  today.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Consumer  Federation  of  America,  for  those 

28 

who’ve come in. 

Mr.  PLUNKETT.  Travis  Plunkett.  I’m  the  Legislative  Director  at 
the  Consumer  Federation  of  America.  I’d  like  to  move  now  from  a 
discussion  about  debt  reduction  scams  involving  secured  credit 
mortgage  and  home  mortgage  lending  to  unsecured  credit,  so  pri-
marily credit card loans. 

And of course Consumer Federation of America and many others 
have  expressed  great  concern  about  irresponsible  and  aggressive 
lending  practices  by  credit  card  companies  which  have  run  up  the 
amount of debt that people have taken on and left them vulnerable 
to  these  scams.  And  when  we’re  talking  about  unsecured  credit, 
two  primary  forms  of  assistance  short  of  bankruptcy,  traditional 
credit  counseling  and  a  newer  and  much  more  harmful  variant 
called debt settlement. So I’ll mention both of those separately. 

Credit  counseling  can  be  very  effective  if  it’s  delivered  by  legiti-
mate non-profit counselors and credit unions. The good news about 
credit counseling is that thanks to the efforts of the Federal Trade 
Commission and the IRS and state regulators, we aren’t seeing the 
kinds of abuses that we saw at the turn of the century. Consumers 
who see a non-profit credit counselor can now be pretty certain that 
the agency isn’t going to overcharge them, isn’t going to try to sell 
them  harmful  ancillary  products  and  isn’t  going  to  try  to  funnel 
their  fees  to  for-profit  affiliates.  That’s  the  very  good  news  about 
credit counseling. 

The  bad  news  is  that  the  value  of  the  assistance,  the  effective-
ness  of  the  assistance  that  credit  counselors  offer  and  this  is  pri-
marily a consolidated credit card payment plan, is less helpful now 
because  creditors,  the  credit  card  companies,  have  not  been  as  ag-
gressive  as  they  should  have  been  in  lowering  the  interest  rates 
that consumers pay to credit counselors in credit counseling. So we 
have a lot of people who are showing up with very high debt loads 
who simply can’t be helped in credit counseling. So they’re turning 
elsewhere. And this is the great concern. 

You  probably  have  seen  advertisements  for  debt  settlement  out-
fits  that  don’t  offer  to  help  you  pay  your  loan  off  over  3  to  5  years 
like credit counseling. They say that they’re going to get you a set-
tlement,  a  one  shot,  lump  sum  payment.  That  they’re  going  to 
bring  your  credit  card  companies  to  their  knees.  And  they’re  going 
to lower what you owe your credit card company by 50 or more per-
cent. If you, like me, occasionally are watching late night cable tel-
evision, you know what I’m talking about. 

The  business  model  used  for  these  companies  is  fatally  flawed 
and  very  harmful  to  consumers.  Let  me  just  tick  off  a  couple  of 
problems.  They  often  mislead  consumers  about  the  likelihood  of  a 
settlement. 

Once  again,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  is  out  front  here. 
They shut down a settlement organization called the National Con-
sumer  Council  in  2004.  We  discovered  that  under  2  percent  of  the 
consumers  that  were  being  supposedly  helped  by  this  company, 
under 2 percent of those consumers were settling their debts, were 
actually reaching settlements with credit card companies. 

A second problem. Unlike credit counseling agencies, these firms 
have no arrangements with creditors. In fact some credit card com-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

29 

panies won’t even deal with them. So they can’t guarantee a settle-
ment  despite  their  advertisements.  That  puts  them  right  on  the 
brink  of  fraudulent  advertising  at  the  very  beginning  of  the  proc-
ess. 

Third, settlement firms often mislead consumers about the effect 
on  their  credit  worthiness  of  the  plans  they’re  offering.  It’s  a  long 
process. You have to save up money to offer a settlement. 

Meanwhile  your  creditors  are  still  trying  to  collect.  Your  debts 
are piling up. They may go to court. Your credit worthiness deterio-
rates. 

And  these  outfits,  these  debt  settlement  companies  are  telling 
people,  don’t  worry.  We’re  going  to  take  care  of  this.  We’re  going 
to get you a really good deal. And in the long run that will improve 
your credit worthiness. 

Fourth  problem.  These  firms  charge  such  high  fees  the  con-
sumers  can’t  save  money.  Remember  these  are  people  in  really  se-
rious debt trouble. 

Fifth. Consumers targeted by these companies are the least like-
ly to benefit. These are the folks facing serious hardship with very 
high  debts.  They  can’t  afford  these  high,  upfront  fees  or  high  back 
end settlement fees. These are the fees they charge as a percentage 
of what they save you. 

So  we  have  a  number  of  policy  recommendations,  starting  with 
some  good  state  laws  that  aren’t  being  enforced.  So  our  first  rec-
ommendation  is  the  states  that  have  good  laws  should  enforce 
them. 

Second  recommendation  is  that  Congress  should  consider  a  min-
imum  standards  law.  Sticking  with  what  Mr.  Cox  just  said,  the 
states  are  doing  some  good  work.  There  are  some  gaps  and  some 
states  don’t  have  the  resources  to  enforce  the  law.  So  let’s  put  a 
minimum  standards  law  on  the  book  that  does  not  preempt  the 
deals with a number of these abuses. 

Fourth,  we  need  some  help  from  banking  regulators  to  create  a 
legitimate  alternative  to  debt  settlement.  There  clearly  is  demand 
here.  Consumers  want  something  that  gives  them  more  assistance 
in  credit  counseling  that  stops  short  of  bankruptcy.  And  right  now 
we have some regulatory hurdles that have not allowed credit card 
companies to create that legitimate alternative. 

And  finally  the  card  companies  themselves  have  to  immediately 
work  to  provide  more  benefits,  more  concessions  they’re  called, 
lower interest rates to consumers in credit counseling. So they can 
get  some  help  and  aren’t  turning  to  these  debt  settlement  firms 
that can hurt them. 

Thank you very much.

sumer  Federation  of  America  (CFA).1 I  am  testifying  today  on  behalf  of  CFA,  the 
National  Consumer  Law  Center,2 on  behalf  of  its  low-income  clients,  and  U.S. 
PIRG.3 I commend the committee for investigating the adequacy of consumer protec-
tions for families with distressed finances. The number of Americans who cannot af-
ford their consumer or mortgage loans is increasing sharply. Many of these families 
are desperately seeking debt reduction assistance short of bankruptcy. 

Effective  assistance  that  helps  some  consumers  reduce  their  unsecured  debts  is 
available  from  legitimate,  non-profit  credit  counselors  and  credit  unions.  However, 
some  creditors  have  reduced  the  value  of  the  ‘‘concessions’’  they  will  allow  agencies 
to offer to debtors in credit counseling at a time when debt problems are increasing. 
Meanwhile,  scam  artists  (including  some  calling  themselves  credit  counselors)  are 
promising to quickly and painlessly reduce the amount of credit card debt that con-
sumers  owe  through  a  variety  of  expensive,  harebrained  and  harmful  schemes. 
Much  more  needs  to  be  done  by  state  and  Federal  policymakers  to  stop  these  abu-
sive  debt  reduction  practices  and,  in  conjunction  with  creditors,  create  legitimate, 
effective debt management alternatives to these harmful ‘‘services.’’ 
Background:  Reckless  and  Irresponsible  Lending  Practices  Have  Caused 
Household Debt Levels to Skyrocket and Left Consumers Vulnerable to 
Debt Reduction Scams 

For  fifteen  years,  CFA  and  many  others  have  warned  that  credit  card  issuers 
were irresponsibly pushing cardholders to take on more debt than they could afford, 
and then using unfair and deceptive tactics to increase debt loads and issuer profits. 
There is considerable evidence linking the rise in bankruptcy in recent years to the 
increase in consumer credit outstanding, and, in particular, to credit card debt. For 
example, research by Professor Ronald Mann of Columbia University has found that 
an increase in credit card spending in the U.S. and four other countries has resulted 
in  higher  credit  card  debt,  which  is  strongly  associated  with  an  increase  in  bank-
ruptcy filings.4 To make matters worse, credit card companies have become far more 
aggressive  in  implementing  questionable  fees  and  interest  rate  practices  in  recent 
years.5 The  upshot  of  these  practices  is  that  penalty  interest  rates,  high  and  accu-
mulating  fees,  and  interest  on  fees  can  push  consumers  with  high  debts  into  the 
hands of debt reduction scam artists or into bankruptcy.6 In fact, consumers in debt 
trouble  sometimes  owe  as  much  or  more  in  fees  and  penalty  interest  charges  as  in 
principal. 

The  growth  of  revolving  debt  in  this  country  to  $964  billion 7 has  obviously  not 
affected  all  Americans  equally.  The  extraordinary  expansion  of  the  credit  card  in-

dustry in the 1990s was fueled by the marketing of credit cards to populations that 
had  not  had  widespread  access  to  mainstream  credit,  including  lower-  and  mod-
erate-income  households,  consumers  with  seriously  blemished  credit  histories,  col-
lege  students,  older  Americans  and  minorities.  For  example,  U.S.  PIRG  reported 
last year that the amount of debt held by students who carry credit card debt more 
than  doubles  between  their  freshman  year  and  senior  year  in  college,  from  $1,301 
to $2,623.8 

In  a  practice  widely  known  as  risk-based  pricing,  creditors  charged  riskier  con-
sumers  more  to  cover  potential  losses,  usually  in  the  form  of  higher  interest  rates. 
To make the assumption of debt more attractive to these households—and to entice 
them  into  carrying  debt  for  longer  periods—creditors  lowered  minimum  payment 
balances  from  around  5  percent  of  principal  to  just  over  2  percent.  As  a  result,  an 
estimated  eighty  percent  of  all  households  now  have  at  least  one  card.9 According 
to the Federal Reserve Board, about 42 percent of cardholding households pay their 
credit  card  bill  in  full  every  month,10 which  means  that  the  remaining  50  million 
or so families that carry debt owe an average of about $17,000.11 

Moderate  and  lower  income  households  that  are  more  financially  vulnerable 
shoulder  a  higher  level  of  debt  relative  to  their  incomes.  In  the  current  economic 
climate, these households are also under financial pressure from many external fac-
tors,  such  as  flat  wages,  rising  unemployment,  skyrocketing  home  foreclosures  and 
increasingly  unaffordable  health  insurance.  In  other  words,  the  ‘‘democratization  of 
credit’’  has  had  serious  negative  consequences  for  many  Americans,  putting  them 
one unexpected financial emergency away from bankruptcy. 

As the economy has worsened and home foreclosures have increased to record lev-
els,  consumers  are  increasingly  having  serious  difficulty  paying  their  credit  card 
bills.  One  widely  watched  measure  of  financial  health,  the  amount  of  credit  card 
debt  paid  off  by  Americans  monthly,  is  now  at  one  of  the  lowest  levels  ever  re-
corded.12 Credit  card  charge-offs,  the  percentage  of  the  value  of  credit  card  loans 
removed  from  the  books  (net  of  recoveries),  or  ‘‘written  off,’’  have  been  persistently 
high for most of the last thirteen years and are now approaching the highest levels 
on record. During the decade between the end of 1995 and the start of 2006, credit 
card  charge-offs  were  not  below  4  percent  in  a  single  quarter.13 They  increased  to 
more than 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 and broke 4 percent again during 
the  latter  half  of  2007.  Since  then,  charge-offs  have  escalated  sharply  to  5.62  per-
cent  in  the  third  quarter  of  2008.  There  is  a  very  good  chance  that  charge-offs  will 
keep  rising  because  the  number  of  delinquent  credit  card  payments—an  early  sign 
of payment difficulty—are also approaching historically high levels. Thirty-day cred-
it  card  delinquencies  are  now  at  their  highest  point  in  6  years,  since  the  last  eco-
nomic recession ended.14 Moreover, a number of major issuers have reported fourth 
quarter charge-offs that indicate that borrower defaults and issuer losses will exceed 

Reserve,  Statistical  Release,  ‘‘Consumer  Credit  Outstanding,’’  Table  G.19.  Although  this  figure 
is  often  used  as  a  proxy  for  credit  card  debt,  most  experts  believe  that  outstanding  credit  card 
debt is slightly lower. First, approximately 5 percent of consumer revolving credit is not on cred-
it  cards.  Second,  between  4  to  9  percent  of  the  debt  does  not  truly  revolve.  It  is  repaid  to  the 
credit card issuer before the next billing cycle starts. Taking these two factors into account, out-
standing credit card debt at the end of 2008 was between $829 and $877 billion.

those  of  the  last  two  recessions.15 The  difficulty  that  many  families  are  having  af-
fording their credit card bills has been exacerbated by the mortgage crisis. As home 
values have dropped sharply, Americans have been unable to use home equity loans 
and  home  refinancing  to  pay  off  their  credit  card  debts.16 Moreover,  some  families 
in financial trouble are continuing to use their credit cards to pay for essential pur-
chases  and  are  therefore  attempting  to  stay  current  on  their  credit  card  loans  but 
not their mortgage payments, a shift in behavior from past economic crises that will 
likely lead to further deterioration of their financial condition.17

Growing problems with the affordability of unsecured debt has not only led to an 
increase  in  the  number  of  consumers  who  are  seeking  personal  bankruptcy  protec-
tion.  Consumer  demand  for  debt  reduction  or  debt  management  assistance  has  in-
creased  too,  especially  in  the  last  2  years  as  the  economy  has  deteriorated.19 Many 
non-profit  organizations  and  for-profit  businesses  have  jumped  in  to  ‘‘help,’’  includ-
ing  non-profit  credit  counseling  agencies  and  for-profit  debt  settlement  companies. 
Credit  Counseling:  Abuses  Have  Declined,  but  so  has  Value  of  the  Debt 

Reduction Offered 

The  credit  counseling  industry  was  created  in  the  mid–1960s  by  credit  card  com-
panies,  which  saw  an  opportunity  to  recover  overdue  debts.  Creditors  initially  pro-
vided  the  bulk  of  the  funding  needed  to  keep  the  agencies  in  business.20 At  first, 
most of the agencies were nonprofit. Debt management plans or DMPs were the fea-
ture service offered by credit counseling agencies, which also provided financial and 
budget  counseling  and  community  education  sessions.  With  DMPs,  a  consumer 
sends  the  credit  counseling  agency  a  lump  sum,  which  the  agency  then  distributes 
to  the  consumer’s  creditors.  In  return,  the  consumer  is  supposed  to  receive  a  break 
in  the  form  of  creditor  agreements  to  waive  fees  and  lower  interest  rates.  Con-
sumers also gain the convenience of making only one payment to the agency rather 
than having to deal with multiple creditors on their own. Through a creditor policy 
known  as  ‘‘fair  share,’’  DMPs  provided  substantial  revenue  for  the  agencies.  Credi-
tors  returned  to  the  agency  a  set  percentage  of  the  funds  that  are  disbursed  to 
them. Over the years, creditors have reduced the amount of fair share funding they 
offer  or  moved  away  from  it  entirely  by  distributing  grants  that  are  not  explicitly 
tied  to  the  amount  of  DMP  funding  collected.  In  response,  agencies  curtailed  some

tied  to  the  amount  of  DMP  funding  collected.  In  response,  agencies  curtailed  some 
free counseling services and raised consumer fees for DMPs. 

The  National  Consumer  Law  Center,  the  Consumer  Federation  of  America,  and 
U.S.  PIRG  were  among  the  first  to  warn  that  the  nature  of  credit  counseling  had 
also  begun  to  dramatically  shift  in  ways  that  were  very  harmful  to  debtors.  In  the 
late  1990s,  a  new  class  of  agencies  emerged  that  aggressively  marketed  DMPs  and 
related services, dramatically raised consumer fees, and had extensive relationships 
with  for-profit  vendors  and  consultants.  Complaints  about  deceptive  practices,  im-
proper  advice,  excessive  fees  and  abuse  of  non-profit  status  sharply  increased.21 
Federal  and  state  regulators  and  policymakers,  who  had  largely  ignored  the  rise  of 
these new agencies, and the problems they had created, began to investigate.22 

By late 2006, the IRS had investigated 63 agencies that brought in more than half 
the revenue of the entire credit counseling industry for violating their non-profit sta-
tus.23 The  Federal  Trade  Commission  had  begun  taking  legal  action  against 
AmeriDebt  and  other  phony  non-profit  agencies  for  a  variety  of  deceptive  practices 
(see Addendum B). State attorneys general had launched a number of similar inves-
tigations and state lawmakers were putting new laws on the books to stop deceptive 
practices and prevent excessive charges.24 

In  July  of  2006,  Congress  created  a  new  section  501(q)  of  the  Internal  Revenue 

Code that imposed standards on non-profit agencies, including the following: 

ees or those who benefit financially from agency activities. 

sumer’s inability to pay or unwillingness to enroll in a DMP. 

• Agencies  may  not  refuse  to  provide  credit  counseling  services  due  to  a  con-
• Agencies must have reasonable fees. 
• Agencies must have a governing body that is not dominated by agency employ-
• Agencies must not exceed a phased in cap of 50 percent of revenues on creditor 
fair  share  contributions  by  2011.  (The  cap  for  the  2009  tax  year  is  70  percent.) 
About the same time, the Executive Office of the United States Trustees (EOUST) 
began  implementing  a  requirement  of  the  new  bankruptcy  law  that  required  those 
who  wish  to  enter  personal  bankruptcy  to  receive  credit  counseling  prior  to  filing 
and a debtor education course before being discharged.25 Consumer groups have se-
rious  questions  about  the  efficacy  and  necessity  of  a  credit  counseling  session  for 
debtors on the verge of bankruptcy, many of whom have suffered a severe reduction 
in  income  or  a  sharp  increase  in  medical  expenses  not  covered  by  insurance.  How-
ever, the EOUST has done a good job of setting standards to help ensure that debt-
ors  headed  to  bankruptcy  are  counseled  by  legitimate,  non-profit  agencies  that  will 
not harm them or delay their bankruptcy filing. 

An  initial  phase  of  research  directed  by  the  Consumer  Federation  and  American 
Express  has  found  that  credit  counseling  can  be  effective  in  helping  consumers  to 
improve  their  credit  worthiness  over  time.26 Consumer  groups  often  advise  con-
sumers  that  a  DMP  could  be  helpful  in  reducing  some  unsecured  debts,  depending 
on  whether  the  financial  condition  of  the  debtor  is  stable  or  deteriorating,  and  on 
the interest rate reduction offered by creditors. 

However,  CFA  has  also  found  that  some  major  creditors  have  actually  increased 
the  interest  rate  they  charge  in  credit  counseling,  while  others  have  kept  these  in-

terest  rates  high  for  many  consumers.  For  example,  when  CFA  surveyed  interest 
rates in credit counseling in 1999 and 2003,27 Bank of America was a model for the 
rest  of  the  industry,  charging  0  percent  APR  for  those  in  a  DMP.  Now,  they  have 
a  range  of  interest  rates  from  1  percent  all  the  way  up  to  16  percent.  There  is  not 
a  single  major  credit  card  issuer  right  now  that  charges  less  than  5  percent  APR 
for  all  of  its  clients  in  DMPs.  (JP  Morgan  Chase  comes  the  closest,  at  6  percent.) 
Capital  One  charges  a  15.9  percent  rate,  unless  the  client  enters  counseling  with 
a  lower  rate.  Discover  charges  a  range  of  rates  that  go  as  high  as  15.9  percent  as 
well. 

As more consumers struggle to continue to pay their credit card loans, it is becom-
ing  increasingly  clear  that  the  DMP  is  a  less  viable  tool  in  helping  consumers  sig-
nificantly reduce their unsecured debt because creditors have kept interest rates too 
high.  While  some  credit  card  issuers  appear  to  have  increased  the  reductions  they 
offer  customers  in  individual  ‘‘workout’’  plans,  such  reductions  can  only  be  helpful 
in stabilizing a consumer’s finances if the person does not have multiple credit card 
debts,  as  many  people  in  debt  trouble  do.  Credit  counseling  executives  are  now 
openly acknowledging that creditor concessions have not kept pace with growing in-
debtedness,  ‘‘. . .  given  the  high  levels  of  unsecured  debt  outstanding,  bankruptcy 
will  be  the  only  option  available  to  many  of  these  families—unless  the  credit  card 
industry provides relief through better concessions, so that a greater number of con-
sumers can qualify for Debt Management Plans.’’ 28 

The  refusal  by  credit  card  issuers  to  significantly  lower  interest  rates  for  con-
sumers  in  credit  counseling  is  perplexing  because  there  are  signs  that  the  industry 
does realize that if it moves aggressively to significantly reduce what consumers owe 
them, it such assistance would likely benefit card issuers in the long run by keeping 
consumers from discharging much or all of their credit card debt in bankruptcy. As 
mentioned  above,  some  issuers  appear  to  be  offering  greater  unilateral  concessions 
to customers who enter workout programs. Moreover, the Financial Services Round-
table  has  recently  collaborated  with  CFA  in  an  effort  to  reduce  or  eliminate  regu-
latory  hurdles  that  currently  inhibit  issuers  from  authorizing  DMPs  that  signifi-
cantly  reduce  the  principal  (not  just  the  interest  charges)  that  consumers  owe.29 
CFA hopes to work with Congress and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
(OCC)  to  quickly  create  a  regulatory  path  that  would  allow  and  encourage  issuers 
to  offer  reduced  principal  DMPs.  Such  a  pathway  would  also  need  to  eliminate  or 
reduce  the  tax  liability  that  consumers  must  pay  on  reduced  principal  settlements. 
Reduced principal DMPs could not only help many families in debt trouble stay sol-
vent,  but  also  create  a  legitimate,  pro-consumer  alternative  to  debt  settlement 
scams (see next section.) 
Debt  Settlement:  Business  Model  is  Inherently  Harmful  to  Vulnerable 

Consumers 

Debt  settlement  involves  negotiating  with  creditors  to  reduce  the  principal 
amount  the  consumer  owes  and  to  pay  this  reduced  amount  over  a  fairly  short  pe-
riod, usually in one or two lump sum payments. Unlike most credit counseling agen-
cies,  debt  settlement  and  debt  negotiation  companies  are  usually  for-profit  busi-
nesses.  Settlement  services  are  different  from  credit  counseling  (or  debt  manage-
ment) mainly because settlement companies do not send regular monthly payments 
to creditors. Instead, these agencies generally maintain a consumer’s funds in sepa-
rate  accounts—or  direct  consumers  to  deposit  savings  in  an  account  that  they  can 
observe  but  do  not  control—until  the  company  believes  it  can  settle  the  consumer’s 
debts  for  less  than  the  full  amount  owed.  Typically,  debtors  can  only  afford  to  pay 
off their creditors sequentially, saving up enough money (after upfront fees are paid) 
to  make  an  offer  to  one  creditor,  then  saving  again  until  there  is  enough  to  offer 
a second settlement, and so on.

some  credit  counseling  agencies  to  offer  some  consumers  reduced  principal  DMPs  over  a  period 
of  up  to  60  months.  Current  guidance  requires  that  reduced  principal  ‘‘settlements’’  must  gen-
erally be paid in full within three to 6 months. Multi-year, reduced principal payment plans are 
not allowed unless the issuer charges off the entire loan before offering the settlement.

Many  companies  have  advised  consumers  to  stop  paying  debts  as  a  condition  of 
participation in the program. Debtors pay a variety of fees for this service, including 
enrollment  fees,  monthly  maintenance  fees  and  a  settlement  fee,  which  is  usually 
a percentage of the forgiven amount of debt. 

The  Federal  Trade  Commission  and  attorneys  general  in  at  least  six  states  have 
begun legal action against debt settlement firms throughout the country. Addendum 
A provides significant details about the range of deceptive, fraudulent, and harmful 
practices that these companies used that the FTC has uncovered, which can be sum-
marized as follows: 

1. Settlement firms often mislead consumers about the likelihood of a settlement. 
Evidence  from  debt  settlement  investigations  indicate  that  a  large  number  of 
consumers  never  complete  a  debt  settlement  program.  One  North  Carolina  as-
sistant attorney general estimates that 80 percent of consumers drop out of debt 
settlement  plans  within  the  first  year.30 A  receivers’  report  on  the  National 
Consumers  Council,  a  purported  non-profit  debt  settlement  organization  that 
was  shut  down  by  the  FTC  in  2004,  found  that  only  1.4  percent  of  NCC  cus-
tomers  settled  with  all  their  creditors.  43  percent  of  their  clients  canceled  the 
program  after  incurring  fees  of  64  percent  of  the  amount  remitted  to  NCC.31 
2.  Unlike  credit  counseling  agencies,  settlement  firms  cannot  guarantee  to  con-
sumers  that  the  creditor  will  agree  to  a  reduced  payment  if  certain  conditions 
are met. In fact, some creditors insist that they won’t negotiate with settlement 
firms  at  all,32 or  that  they  will  initiate  a  collections  action  if  they  learn  that 
a debt settlement company is negotiating on behalf of a consumer. 
3.  Settlement  firms  often  mislead  consumers  about  the  effect  of  the  settlement 
process  on  debt  collection  and  their  credit  worthiness.  Withholding  payment  to 
settle  multiple  debts  is  a  very  long  process.  Meanwhile,  additional  fees  and  in-
terest  rates  continue  to  buildup,  creditors  continue  to  try  to  collect  on  unpaid 
debts,  and  consumers’  credit  worthiness  continues  to  deteriorate.  Some  firms 
still  advise  consumers  not  to  pay  debts,  either  implicitly  or  explicitly.  Others 
firms  say  they  never  tell  consumers  not  to  pay  their  debts  but  only  accept  cli-
ents  who  have  already  done  so.  Moreover,  many  settlement  firms  have  not  fol-
lowed  through  with  promises  that  they  will  stop  collection  calls.  In  fact,  under 
the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act,  consumers  can  only  request  that  third 
party  collection  efforts  stop,  not  collection  attempts  by  a  credit  card  company 
on its own behalf. 
4. Settlement firms charge such high fees that consumers often don’t end up sav-
ing much to make settlement offers, which is why so many drop out of settlement 
programs.  Debt  settlement  firms  typically  require  consumers  to  pay  fees  of  be-
tween 14 and 20 percent upfront (and as high as 30 percent) before they receive 
a settlement. It is often not made clear to consumers that a hefty portion of the 
payments  they  make  in  the  first  year  will  go  to  the  firm,  not  to  their  reserve 
fund or creditors. Many firms also charge monthly fees to maintain accounts as 
well  as  a  ‘‘settlement  fee’’  of  between  15  and  30  percent  of  the  amount  of  debt 
that has been forgiven. 
5. As a result of high fees, consumers targeted by debt settlement companies are 
generally  the  least  likely  to  benefit.  Some  firms  will  work  only  with  insolvent 
consumers  who  are  unemployed  or  those  in  a  hardship  situation.  Many  have 
minimum  debt  requirements  of  $10,000  to  $12,000.  Consumers  facing  serious 
hardship with very high debts are, of course, the least likely to be able to afford 
the  hefty  payments  that  are  charged.  Settlement  firms  also  appear  to  make  no 
distinction, as a good attorney would, between consumers in these hardship sit-
uations who are vulnerable to legal judgments to collect and those who are not. 
6.  It  is  unclear  what  professional  services  most  debt  settlement  companies  offer 
to assist debtors while they save money to pay for a settlement. Serious negotia-
tion  with  creditors  cannot  commence  until  a  significant  settlement  amount  is 
saved,  which  could  take  years  once  high  fees  are  paid.  A  persistent  complaint 
by  consumers  is  that  settlement  companies  do  not  contact  creditors  at  all  in 
some cases.

The  combined  impact  on  consumers  of  these  practices  can  be  devastating.  To  get 
a sense of the impact on the many indebted borrowers for whom the debt settlement 
business model does not work, CFA examined some of the thousands of debt settle-
ment complaints that are on various consumer review websites. Here are a few sum-
maries of the stories we found (all from the past 5 months): 

• One  (anonymous)  consumer  was  convinced  by  a  debt  settlement  company  that 
it  had  strong  relationships  with  major  creditors  and  that  its  services  would  be 
a good alternative to bankruptcy. After she signed up with the settlement com-
pany, she was instructed to stop making payments to creditors. She later found 
out that the extent of the settlement company’s involvement amounted to send-
ing ‘‘power of attorney’’ letters to the creditors. Without help from the company 
she hired, she is now facing at least two collections lawsuits alone. 

• One woman was persuaded to stop paying her creditors and to start paying the 
debt settlement company over $800 a month with the promise that her creditors 
would stop their collections calls and that she could reach a good settlement on 
her credit card balance. The settlement company took the money, but no settle-
ments  ever  took  place,  and  creditors  never  stopped  calling.  After  7  months  of 
no progress with her accounts, she stopped paying the company’s fees. Without 
being able to get a refund of the more than $5,000 she paid in fees, she is now 
saving money for a bankruptcy lawyer. After a legal firm later acquired her ac-
counts,  she  discovered  that  the  original  settlement  company  routinely  dealt 
with other customers in the same way. 

• After  hearing  nothing  from  his  debt  settlement  company  for  several  months, 
Chris  from  Maryland  attempted  to  respond  personally  to  a  credit  card  collec-
tions letter. The debt settlement company later scolded and threatened him be-
cause  he  contacted  the  creditor  directly.  He  realized  that  the  company  was  not 
keeping  up  its  end  of  the  bargain,  and  he  decided  that  the  $300/month  he  was 
paying  in  fees  was  not  money  well  spent.  He  has  tried  to  sever  his  ties  with 
the settlement company, but they continue to ignore his requests. 

• ‘‘T’’  from  Arizona  regularly  saw  television  advertisements  for  a  particular  debt 
settlement  company  and  thought  they  appeared  legitimate.  He  called  the  com-
pany  and  was  promised  that  his  payments  would  be  only  $300  a  month.  The 
company collected his personal financial information and instructed him to stop 
paying his creditors. After 4 months and over $1,500 in fees being automatically 
drawn  from  his  bank  account,  the  consumer  found  out  that  no  creditors  had 
been paid. He eventually had to put a ‘‘stop payment’’ order on his bank account 
to  prevent  the  settlement  company  from  automatically  withdrawing  what  they 
pleased.  The  consumer  is  now  stuck  with  a  damaged  credit  report,  excessive 
fees, and no debt settlements. 

• Frank  from  New  York  was  directly  contacted  by  a  debt  settlement  company 
after visiting the company website. After a promise that the company would set-
tle his debts, he decided to accept the $250 per month fee. Nearly a year later, 
with  no  progress  in  debt  settlements,  he  stopped  hearing  from  them.  After 
many  unanswered  calls  and  e-mails,  he  finally  received  a  response  from  the 
company  that  he  would  get  a  partial  refund.  Since  then  the  company  has  ig-
nored his efforts to receive the refund and his debts remain unsettled. 

Creditors obviously must share some responsibility for the growth of the debt set-
tlement industry. For one thing, some credit card issuers are knowingly doing busi-
ness  with  these  firms.  For  another,  there  clearly  is  consumer  demand  for  a  legiti-
mate  debt  reduction  approach  that  offers  more  relief  than  traditional  credit  coun-
seling but is not as far reaching as bankruptcy. As stated above, creditors have not 
lowered interest rates in credit counseling. On a positive note, as mentioned above, 
creditors  have  now  taken  steps  to  get  permission  from  Federal  regulators  to  offer 
reduced principal, multi-year payment plans. The 2005 bankruptcy act attempted to 
provide  an  incentive  to  creditors  to  offer  ‘‘60/60’’  plans  (60  percent  of  what  the  bor-
rower owes paid off over 60 months.) 33 

Ultimately,  it  appears  clear  that  the  business  model  for  debt  settlement  is  struc-
turally  flawed.  The  essential  promise  made  by  debt  settlement  firms  to  the  public, 
that  they  can  settle  most  debts  for  significantly  less  than  what  is  owed,  is  often 
fraudulent.  There  is  a  general  consensus  that  credit  counseling,  if  done  well,  can 
provide  significant  benefits  for  some  financially  distressed  consumers.  No  such  con-
sensus  exists  for  debt  settlement.  Debt  settlement  firms  should  have  to  prove  that,

37 

in the face of significant evidence to the contrary, their business model can and does 
actually help more than a few financially distressed consumers. 
Recommendations 
Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, and the States 

Debt  settlement  is  regulated  primarily  at  the  state  level.  Seven  states  have 
banned debt settlement.34 Four more have adopted limited restrictions on the prac-
tice  proposed  by  the  National  Conference  of  Commissioners  on  Uniform  State 
Laws.35 A  number  of  other  states  have  restrictions  on  debt  management  or  adjust-
ment  that  do  not  explicitly  pertain  to  the  practice  of  for-profit  debt  settlement,  but 
cover it. States can also deploy laws regarding credit repair, the unauthorized prac-
tice  of  law,  and  unfair  and  deceptive  practices  (UDAP)  against  selected  debt  settle-
ment practices.36 

Regarding  laws  at  the  Federal  level,  some  debt  settlement  firms  appear  to  have 
violated the Federal Credit Repair Organizations Act by claiming that they will im-
prove consumers’ credit. The Federal Trade Commission has used the FTC Act well 
to pursue settlement firms that have used unfair and deceptive practices. 

We  recommend  that  state  and  Federal  policymakers,  regulators  and  enforcement 

offices consider taking the following steps: 

1.  The  Federal  Trade  Commission  and  state  attorneys  general  should  continue 
to  enforce  UDAP  laws.  We  also  urge  the  FTC  to  immediately  use  its  subpoena 
power to examine the records of the largest debt settlement firms in the country 
to determine if these firms are or are not making fraudulent claims about their 
ability to deliver large settlements for most of their customers. 
2.  UDAP  prosecutions  can  be  time-consuming  and  costly,  so  it  is  essential  that 
state  lawmakers  in  particular  begin  to  more  aggressively  enforce  debt  manage-
ment  and  other  laws  that  regulate  the  practice  of  debt  settlement,  including 
tight limits on what firms are allowed to charge. 
3.  Congress  should  consider  the  enactment  of  a  Federal  law  setting  a  strong 
minimum standard based on the best state laws directed specifically at debt set-
tlement, which states could exceed if local conditions warrant such a move. This 
would bring the power and reach of the Federal Government in enforcing tough 
standards  throughout  the  country.  At  the  very  least  such  minimum  standards 
should: 

debts are settled, except for a small enrollment fee. 

• Prohibit  debt  settlement  firms  from  collecting  any  fees  from  consumers  until 
• Prohibit firms from misrepresenting the settlement process’ impact on the credit 
• Place a cap on back end settlement fees, based on the settlement services actu-
• Require  that  any  debt  serviced  by  a  settlement  firm  must  be  settled  within  12

months. 
4.  In  order  to  help  facilitate  the  creation  of  a  legitimate  alternative  to  third- 
party  debt  settlement,  banking  regulatory  agencies  should  take  steps  to  allow 
creditors  to  offer  multi-year,  reduced  principal  payment  plans,  consistent  with 
sound  accounting  principals.  If  regulators  cannot  agree  on  a  solution  that 
achieves this goal quickly, Congress should step in to offer one. 
5.  As  it  has  done  in  the  mortgage  lending  context,  Congress  should  consider 
waiving  or  reducing  the  tax  liability  that  consumers  must  pay  for  the  forgiven 
amount of any debt settlement (above $600).

Credit card issuers should act to immediately lower interest rates charged to con-

Complaint alleged that the defendants: 
• Falsely  claimed  that,  for  a  non-refundable  fee  of  up  to  15  percent  of  a  con-
sumer’s  unsecured  debt,  they  could  reduce  all  of  their  unsecured  debts,  includ-
ing credit card balances and medical bills, by as much as 40 percent to 60 per-
cent. 
• Falsely  represented  that  they  would  contact  consumers’  creditors  immediately. 
• Charged a nonrefundable fee of 12–15 percent of the total debt. 
• To  the  extent  that  they  initiated  negotiations  with  creditors,  these  settlements 
typically  began  only  after  a  consumer  paid  30  percent  to  40  percent  of  the  fee. 
This could take up to 3 months after a consumer followed the advice of the set-
tlement firm and stopped making payments to creditors. 
• Rarely negotiated settlements with all of a consumer’s creditors, and even when 
they  have  successfully  negotiated  an  account,  in  many  cases,  the  settlement 
amount is significantly more than 60 percent of what consumers owe. 
• Caused most consumers, who typically left the program within 6 months of en-
rolling  without  completing  it,  to  incur  larger  debt  as  a  result  of  penalties,  fees, 
interest, and other charges. 
• Failed  to  adequately  disclose  the  likelihood  that  consumers  would  be  sued  if 
• Falsely  advised  consumers  that  negative  information  that  appeared  on  their 
credit  report  as  a  result  of  participating  in  the  defendants’  program  would  be

40  to  60  percent  and  that  consumers  would  stop  receiving  collection  calls  from

failure  to  pay  their  creditors  will  demonstrate  a  ‘‘hardship  condition’’  that  will 
enable BBFS to negotiate on their behalf and instructed them to set a bank ac-
count into which to deposit a specific amount each month to cover the fees and

Complaint alleged that: 
• The  Canadian  telemarketer,  Select  Personnel  Management,  Inc.,  falsely  told 
U.S. consumers that they could reduce their credit card interest rates and that 
they were affiliated with the consumers’ credit card companies, violating Section 
5 of the FTC Act and the FTC’s Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR). 
• The  telemarketer  promised  consumers  to  effect  credit  card  rates  between  4.75 
percent  and  9  percent,  thus  saving  consumers  at  least  $2,500,  and  that  if  con-
sumers did not save that amount their money would be refunded.

eventually  resulted  in  three-way  telephone  calls  with  the  telemarketer,  con-
sumers  and  their  credit  card  companies  where  the  companies  were  asked  to 
lower their interest rates. The requests were usually denied and that was often 
the extent of the services provided.

And  we’ll  see  the  testimony  is  there.  I  appreciate  the  fact  that 
you’ve  done  that.  That  we  have  your  words  in  print  and  I  have  a 
chance to look it over. 

The situation you describe is of a serious emergency nature. And 
just  adds  fuel  to  the  fire  that  this  country  is  now  in  front  of  us. 
So please, Mr. Himpler, we’d like to hear from you. 

And you don’t have to be concerned about where you’re glancing. 
It’s—I am now the acting Chairman. So I’ll try to act patiently and 
listen very keenly. Thank you. Please. 
STATEMENT OF BILL HIMPLER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

AMERICAN FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION 

Mr. HIMPLER. Thank you, Mr. Acting Chairman. My name is Bill 
Himpler.  I’m  the  Executive  Vice  President  at  the  American  Finan-
cial Services Association, the national trade association for the con-
sumer  credit  industry  protecting  access  to  credit  and  consumer 
choice. 

We  want  to  commend  the  members  of  this  Committee  for  con-
vening  this  important  hearing  to  explore  what  can  be  done  about 
unscrupulous  actors  who  exploit  consumers’  fears  about  their  debt 
obligations and worse still, the fear of the possibility of losing their 
home.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  consumer  protec-
tions  for  people  with  distressed  finances  who  are  trying  to  nego-
tiate  to  avoid  bankruptcy.  Let  me  state  at  the  outset  that  AFSA 
shares  the  concerns  of  Congress  and  the  members  of  this  com-
mittee about the growing number of consumers who are having dif-
ficulty  making  payments  on  a  variety  of  debts  and  organizations 
that scam consumers with fraudulent credit repair and rescue pro-
grams. 

Not  only  do  these  scams  affect  individual  borrowers  like  Mrs. 
Dix.  They  also  affect  creditors  and  the  broader  market  to  the  ex-
tent that they promote the removal of accurate and timely informa-
tion  from  consumer  credit  reports.  This  results  in  inaccurate  as-
sessments of the true credit standing of consumers and thereby un-
dermines  the  legitimate  efforts  to  assist  consumers  in  resolving 
their credit difficulties. 

We believe instances of these scams can be reduced through four

And  more  widespread  enactment  of  the  Uniform  Debt  Manage-

ment Services Act. 

And I’d like to touch on each of these. 
AFSA  member  companies  routinely  cooperate  with  legitimate 
consumer  educators  and  advocates  such  as  the  National  Founda-
tion  for  Consumer  Credit  Counseling  Services.  In  conjunction  with 
various CCCS organizations, most creditors offer a variety of stand-
ardized,  in-house  hardship  plans  and  work  out  programs  to  assist 
troubled consumers in dealing with temporary and permanent situ-
ations.  These  programs  require  no  third-party  involvement  and  no 
negotiation.  All  the  consumer  has  to  do  is  contact  his  or  her  cred-
itor, explain his or her situation and ask what options are available 
to him or her. 

Getting  the  consumer  to  admit  that  they  are  in  trouble  in  the 
first  place  and  make  the  initial  call  remains  our  chief  obstacle. 
Minimizing  this  problem  requires  education  of  consumers  about 
their  options  and  promoting  financial  literacy.  Along  these  lines 
AFSA  is  a  long-time  advocate  for  personal  finance  education  that 
helps people make informed decisions as well as avoid scams. 

Today that need for consumer education is greater than ever be-
fore  as  products  are  more  complex.  Our  association’s  education 
foundation  has  developed  an  array  of  financial  literacy  brochures 
in  English  and  Spanish  in  partnership  with  other  trade  organiza-
tions,  regulatory  groups  and  governmental  agencies.  All  of  these 
brochures are provided at no cost to the consumer. 

We also want to bring to your attention the fine work of the FTC 
in  developing  an  excellent  series  of  simple,  informative  pamphlets. 
These pamphlets educate consumers on how to help themselves, ex-
plain their rights as consumers and describe various financial prod-
ucts and how various financial products and credit reports operate. 
These pamphlets also warn consumers about scams and specifically 
advise them on how to spot scams and how to avoid become victims 
of them. 

Equipping  consumers  with  the  information  they  need  to  obtain 
legitimate  help  is  clearly  the  most  effective  method  for  preventing 
harm to consumers. Yet because some consumers cannot resist the 
promises of easy solutions like the ones that my good friend, Travis 
mentioned  on  late  night  cable  that  are  very  alluring,  effective  en-
forcement must also continue. 

AFSA  fully  supports  the  government’s  efforts  to  crack  down  on 
fraudulent consumer assistance scams and lauds the FTC’s work in 
this  area.  A  prime  example  is  the  FTC’s  Operation  Clean  Sweep 
announced last October which cracked down on 33 credit repair or-
ganizations. The FTC partnered with 22 states to pursue organiza-
tions  engaging  in  activities  such  as  claiming  the  ability  to  perma-
nently remove negative information from consumers’ credit reports, 
even when that information is accurate and non-obsolete, requiring 
advance payment for such services and failing to provide the man-
dated  Federal  and  state  notices.  Operation  Clean  Sweep  sought  to 
enjoin these fraudulent and illegal practices and force these organi-
zations to repay consumers. 

The  FTC  has  also  pursued  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  compa-
nies which have falsely claimed the ability to stop foreclosure in re-
turn  for  a  fee.  As  you  can  imagine  this  has  rarely  happened.  In-

stead  consumers,  like  Mrs.  Dix,  were  put  in  worse  financial  posi-
tion,  deprived  of  options  and  made  to  suffer  avoidable  injury  to 
their  credit  standing  because  of  delays  in  starting  negotiations. 
AFSA  has  supported  the  FTC  in  these  efforts  and  last  year  the 
FTC held a workshop entitled, ‘‘Consumer Protection and Debt Set-
tlement  Industry.’’  We  submitted  comment  letters  in  response  to 
the  FTC  noting  that  debt  settlement  companies  often  block  or  dis-
courage  consumer  communication  with  lenders.  However,  in  many 
cases  a  debt  settlement  company  can’t  even  be  reached  leaving 
lenders without a means to resolve the debt with the borrower. 

Additionally  AFSA  believes  that  states  should  be  encouraged  to 
enact  the  Uniform  Debt  Management  Services  Act.  It  provides  the 
states  with  a  comprehensive  act  governing  these  services,  and  will 
mean  a  national  administration  of  debt  counseling  and  manage-
ment in a fair and effective way. 

In  closing,  Mr.  Chairman,  AFSA  believes  the  availability  of  le-
gitimate credit counseling services and consumer education can re-
duce  incidence  of  scams  targeting  vulnerable  consumers.  We  be-
lieve  that  the  FTC  in  conjunction  with  state  law  enforcement  offi-
cials  is  best  equipped  to  address  the  need  to  protect  consumers 
against  these  unscrupulous  actors.  AFSA  supports  allocating  addi-
tional  resources  to  the  FTC  to  continue  its  enforcement  actions 
such as Operation Clean Sweep. 

In addition, we encourage the FTC to utilize its authority to pro-
mulgate  a  trade  rule  against  deceptive  and  misleading  ads  that 
promise  secret  programs  that  will  reduce  a  consumer’s  obligation 
by  60  to  80  percent.  With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I’d  be  happy  to  an-
swer any questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Himpler follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BILL HIMPLER, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 

AMERICAN FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION 

Chairman  Rockefeller,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee, good morning. My name is Bill Himpler, and I am the Executive Vice Presi-
dent  at  the  American  Financial  Services  Association  (AFSA).  AFSA  is  the  national 
trade  association  for  the  consumer  credit  industry,  protecting  access  to  credit  and 
consumer  choice.  The  association  encourages  and  maintains  ethical  business  prac-
tices and supports financial education for consumers of all ages. AFSA has provided 
services  to  its  members  for  over  90  years.  AFSA’s  350  member  companies  include 
consumer  and  commercial  finance  companies,  ‘‘captive’’  auto  finance  companies, 
credit  card  issuers,  mortgage  lenders,  industrial  banks,  and  other  financial  service 
firms that lend to consumers and small businesses. 

Mr.  Chairman,  AFSA  commends  you  and  your  colleagues  for  convening  this  im-
portant hearing to explore what can be done about unscrupulous actors who exploit 
consumers’ fears about their debt obligations, or worse still, the possibility of losing 
their  homes.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  provide  testimony  to  the  Members  of 
the Committee on consumer protections for people with distressed finances who are 
trying to negotiate mitigation strategies so that they can avoid bankruptcy. 

Let me state at the outset that AFSA members share Congress’ concern about the 
growing number of consumers who are having difficulty making payments on a vari-
ety  of  debts  and  organizations  that  scam  consumers  with  fraudulent  credit  repair 
and  rescue  programs.  Not  only  do  such  scams  affect  individual  borrowers,  but  they 
also affect creditors and the broader market to the extent that, among other things, 
they  promote  the  removal  of  accurate  and  timely  information  from  consumer  credit 
reports.  This  results  in  inaccurate  assessments  of  the  true  credit  standing  of  con-
sumers, promoting inaction and delay, thereby undermining legitimate efforts to as-
sist consumers in resolving credit difficulties. 

We  believe  instances  of  these  scams  can  be  reduced  through  four  measures:  (1) 
the continued availability of legitimate counseling and hardship plans, (2) consumer

education  that  helps  people  make  wise  financial  decisions,  (3)  enhancement  of  the 
Federal  Trade  Commission’s  initiatives  to  crack  down  on  bad  actors  and  (4)  more 
widespread enactment of the Uniform Debt- Management Services Act (UDMSA). In 
the time that I have, I’ll touch upon each of these areas. 
Credit Counseling and Hardship Plans 

Distressed  consumers  are  particularly  susceptible  to  rosy  claims  of  fraudulent 
credit  repair  and  mortgage  rescue  organizations.  They  are  lured  by  too-good-to-be- 
true  claims  of  easy  solutions  to  tough  problems  and  empty  promises  of  help  when 
they feel overwhelmed. As the Federal Trade Commission has observed, ‘‘only time, 
a  conscious  effort,  and  a  personal  debt  repayment  plan’’  can  improve  a  consumer’s 
credit report. Similarly, only time, a conscious effort and commitment to a personal 
debt repayment plan can resolve a difficult financial situation. 

AFSA member companies routinely cooperate with legitimate consumer educators 
and  advocates  such  as  the  National  Foundation  for  Credit  Counseling  (NFCC)  and 
Consumer  Credit  Counseling  Services  (CCCS).  For  example,  assistance  plans  are 
pre-negotiated  between  individual  creditors  and  various  CCCS  organizations.  Dis-
tressed consumers can easily participate in these plans with little or no negotiation 
necessary.  The  consumer  simply  needs  to  show  eligibility  by  explaining  the  source 
and extent of distress. 

Most  creditors  offer  a  variety  of  standardized  in-house  hardship  plans  and  work-
out  programs  to  assist  troubled  consumers  in  dealing  with  temporary  and  perma-
nent situations. These programs require no third-party involvement and no negotia-
tion. As established programs, again, all a consumer has to do is contact his or her 
creditor,  explain  his  or  her  situation  and  ask  what  options  are  available.  Getting 
consumers  to  admit  that  they  are  in  trouble  and  make  the  first  call  or  engage  a 
creditor’s  customer  service  or  collections  personnel  can  be  problematic.  Minimizing 
this problem requires educating consumers about their options and promoting finan-
cial literacy. 
Consumer Education 

AFSA  is  a  long-time  advocate  for  personal  finance  education  that  helps  people 
make informed decisions as well as avoid scams. Today, that need for consumer edu-
cation is greater than ever before, as products are more complex with variable rate 
loans, adjustable rate mortgages, credit card loans, various derivatives and the like. 
The AFSA Education Foundation has developed an array of financial literacy bro-
chures in English and Spanish in partnerships with other trade organizations, regu-
lator  groups  and  government  agencies  for  use  by  adult  consumers  and  AFSA  mem-
bers in the areas of vehicle financing, mortgage loans, personal loans, and personal 
financial  management.  All  of  these  brochures  are  provided  at  no  cost  to  consumers 
upon request, as well as downloadable online at www.afsaef.org. 

Each educational piece includes information on what to do if a person encounters 
difficulties  in  meeting  financial  obligations.  First,  you  should  contact  your  creditor, 
explain your situation and work out a repayment schedule. Second, if your situation 
requires  addition  help,  contact  a  non-profit  budget  and  credit  counseling  agency, 
often  called  a  consumer  credit  counseling  service.  These  agencies  can  work  directly 
with consumers and their creditors to help resolve debt problems. 

We also want to bring to your attention the fine work of the Federal Trade Com-
mission  (FTC)  in  developing  an  excellent  series  of  simple,  informative  pamphlets. 
These pamphlets: 

is not necessary, even if occasionally helpful); 

• Educate  consumers  on  how  to  help  themselves  (again,  third  party  involvement 
• Explain consumers’ rights; and 
• Describe how various financial products and credit reports operate. 
The  pamphlets  also  directly  warn  consumers  about  scams—specifically  advising 
them  on  how  to  spot  scams  and  how  to  avoid  becoming  victims  of  them.  These  re-
sources  are  freely  available  from  the  FTC  on  its  Website  and  can  be  printed  and 
distributed as educational handouts and pamphlets by various organizations. Equip-
ping consumers with the information they need to obtain legitimate help and avoid 
becoming  victims  is  clearly  the  most  effective  method  of  preventing  harm  to  con-
sumers. 
Enhancement of Ongoing FTC Initiatives 

Nonetheless, because some consumers cannot resist promises of easy solutions, ef-
fective  enforcement  must  also  continue.  AFSA  fully  supports  government  efforts  to 
crack down on fraudulent consumer assistance scams, and lauds the FTC’s work in 
this area.

A prime example is the FTC’s ‘‘Operation Clean Sweep,’’ announced last October, 
which  cracked  down  on  33  ‘‘credit  repair’’  organizations.  The  FTC  partnered  with 
24  state  agencies  in  22  states  to  pursue  organizations  engaging  in  activities  such 
as:  (i)  claiming  the  ability  to  permanently  remove  negative  information  from  con-
sumers’  credit  reports,  even  when  the  information  is  accurate  and  not  obsolete,  (ii) 
requiring  advance  payment  for  credit  repair  services,  and  (iii)  failing  to  provide 
mandated  Federal  and  state  notices.  ‘‘Operation  Clean  Sweep’’  sought  to  enjoin 
these fraudulent and illegal practices, prohibit further violations and force these or-
ganizations to pay reparation to consumers and forfeit ill-gotten gains. Other similar 
efforts were announced before and after this particular operation. 

The  FTC  has  also  pursued  mortgage  foreclosure  ‘‘rescue’’  companies  which  have 
falsely claimed the ability to stop foreclosure in return for a fee. In many instances, 
these  ‘‘rescue’’  companies  promised  a  refund  of  all  fees  if  unsuccessful  in  avoiding 
foreclosure. This rarely happened. Instead, consumers were put in a worse financial 
position,  deprived  of  options  and  made  to  suffer  avoidable  injury  to  their  credit 
standing  because  of  delays  in  starting  negotiations  and  poor  or  nonexistent  follow- 
through  with  negotiations  when  begun.  The  FTC’s  actions  have  sought  to  prohibit 
further  deceptive  behavior  and  to  compel  such  companies  to  pay  consumer  redress 
and forfeit fraudulently obtained funds. 

AFSA  has  supported  the  FTC  in  these  efforts.  In  September  2008,  the  FTC  held 
a  workshop  entitled,  Consumer  Protection  and  the  Debt  Settlement  Industry,  to  ex-
plore  the  growth  of  the  for-profit  debt  settlement  industry  and  to  analyze  how  its 
model is affecting consumers and businesses. AFSA submitted two comment letters 
in response to the FTC’s request. In the first letter, we noted that many debt settle-
ment  companies  actually  do  harm  to  both  consumers  and  creditors  by  engaging  in 
questionable  practices,  abusing  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting  Act,  abusing  the  power 
given to them by consumers, perpetrating fraud, delaying in remitting payment, en-
gaging in deceitful actions, and facilitating false complaints. 

AFSA staff attended the workshop and learned that the FTC was looking for spe-
cific  information  from  lenders  on  debt  settlement  companies.  In  response,  we  sub-
mitted a follow-up letter, which is included as part of this testimony. During discus-
sions  with  its  members,  AFSA  learned  that  debt  settlement  companies  often  block 
or discourage consumer communication with the lender. However, in many cases the 
debt  settlement  company  cannot  be  contacted  and  no  further  communication  is  re-
ceived  from  them.  Thus,  the  lenders  are  left  without  a  means  to  resolve  the  out-
standing debt. 

One  of  AFSA’s  members  noted  that,  with  the  exception  of  one  debt  settlement 
company,  once  customers  got  involved  with  a  debt  settlement  company,  generally 
one  of  two  things  will  happen:  (1)  They  realize  that  their  credit  is  being  affected 
and the debt settlement company is not doing anything but taking their money and 
they will start making payments again; or (2) the lender never hears from the cus-
tomer again and the account is written off to bad debt. 
Greater Enactment of the UDMSA 

In  addition  to  the  measures  I’ve  discussed  so  far,  AFSA  believes  that  the  states 
should  be  encouraged  to  enact  the  Uniform  Debt-Management  Services  Act 
(UDMSA), which was promulgated by the Uniform Law Commissioners. It provides 
the  states  with  a  comprehensive  act  governing  these  services  that  will  mean  na-
tional  administration  of  debt  counseling  and  management  in  a  fair  and  effective 
way.  UDMSA  also  provides  fairer  and  better  services  to  debtors.  Four  states  have, 
to  date,  adopted  the  UDMSA.  In  March  2008,  several  important  amendments  were 
made to the Act; with these amendments, up to 20 states are expected to introduce 
the Act in 2009. 

In  closing,  AFSA  believes  the  availability  of  legitimate  credit  counseling  services 
and  consumer  education  can  reduce  incidents  of  scams  targeting  vulnerable  con-
sumers.  We  believe  that  the  FTC,  in  conjunction  with  state  law  enforcement  offi-
cials,  is  best  equipped  to  address  the  need  to  protect  consumers  against  these  un-
scrupulous actors. AFSA supports allocating additional resources for the FTC to con-
tinue  its  enforcement  actions,  such  as  Operation  Clean  Sweep.  In  addition,  we  en-
courage the FTC to utilize its authority to promulgate a trade rule against deceptive 
and  misleading  ads  that  promise  ‘‘secret  programs’’  that  will  reduce  consumer  obli-
gations by 60 to 80 percent. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be happy to answer any questions. 

The  CHAIRMAN [presiding].  Mr.  Himpler,  sorry  for  the  inconven-
ience  everybody.  People  are  going  back  and  forth  and  voting,  and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

48 

lots  of  major  committees  are  meeting  right  now,  so  it  just  makes 
it complicated. 

Mr. Himpler, I would think it would be safe to assume that your 
organization  was  involved  in  lobbying  for  the  Bankruptcy  Abuse 
Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005? 

Mr. HIMPLER. That’s correct. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  There  are  several  provisions  of  that  legislation 
that bother me greatly. I’d like to ask you about them. But I want 
to discuss one in particular that puts consumers at great risk. 

A  number  of  your  members  offer  credit  cards  with  significant 
credit  lines  to  people  that  have  just  emerged  from  personal  bank-
ruptcy. This makes no sense to me especially when you look at the 
bankruptcy bill which prevents a person emerging from bankruptcy 
from  having  credit  card  debt  discharged  again  for  8  years.  It’s  the 
law. 

You  now  have  a  truly  captive  market  of  consumers  who  would 
get  no  relief  if  they  get  into  trouble  again.  By  not  handling  this 
credit wisely, no fault of their own, adding to the people susceptible 
to be swindled. So my question is in light of predatory behavior en-
gaged  in  by  some  of  your  credit  card  issuers  which  creates  more 
desperate  people  susceptible  to  financial  fraud,  would  you  support 
making  these  card  issuers  bear  the  risk  of  their  lending  decisions 
and  let  these  debts  be  discharged  if  the  consumer  needs  bank-
ruptcy protection again? 

Mr.  HIMPLER.  I  do  believe  that  the  Act  affords  consumers  that 

very protection. But obviously we would support that. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  You  would  support  that.  Commission  Harbour 
and  Mr.  Himpler  both,  I  would  like  to  ask  you  both  to  respond  to 
the following questions. Both the FTC and the AFSA, your organi-
zations  are  engaged  in  education  and  fraud  prevention  activities 
where your message has reached limited audiences. 

On  the  other  hand,  you  know,  you’re  trying  to  make  your  state-
ments for whatever reason but if people don’t have Internet, you’re 
targeting fraudulent advertising to people who need your help and 
advice  but  may  not  have  the  means  to  receive  it.  So  my  questions 
are,  to  each  of  you,  if  the  fraudsters  have  the  ability  to  reach  the 
broadcast  scope  of  distressed  consumers  why  can’t  your  organiza-
tions? 

Ms. HARBOUR. I would like to respond to that. The Federal Trade 
Commission has a three-prong approach to reaching consumers and 
eradicating  fraudulent  behavior.  We  have  targeted  law  enforce-
ment. We have our consumer education and outreach and we have 
our research and empirical policy studies. 

You’re  speaking  to  the  education  and  outreach  prong.  We  dis-
seminate  information  to  consumers  in  many  ways.  And  I  under-
stand  a  keen  issue  of  yours,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  the  digital  divide. 
Not  everyone  has  access  to  high  speed  broadband.  And  your  con-
cern is, is our information reaching your constituents? 

Well,  we  deliver  and  disseminate  information,  not  only  through 
the FTC website but we send it to consumers who call our toll-free 
help line. We also do it through the media. 

The CHAIRMAN. How do they know about that? 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  May  I  go  through  everything  we  do  to  reach  the 
American consumer? I believe that we are unparalleled in reaching

49 

out  to  the  American  consumer  to  inform  them  about  ways  to  help 
them  in  this  area.  We  have  a  network  of  over  1,000  community- 
based organizations that link to our materials or can order our ma-
terials. 

We  do  have  limited  resources.  But  our  strategy  is  to  be  whole-
salers of the information rather than retailers. And because of this 
we  work  through  10,000  community-based  groups  that  distribute 
information to members, to clients and to constituents. 

We  also  use  very  innovative  approaches  to  reach  out  to  con-
sumers. For instance in January when we settled the Bear Stearns 
case  for  $28  million,  we  sent  redress  checks  back  to  86,000  con-
sumers. And in those redressed checks we put an educational book-
mark about mortgage servicing in each one of those envelopes with 
checks. 

Another  thing  that  we  have  done  is  develop  a  series  of  edu-
cational  materials  that  are  unparalleled  in  this  area  on  how  to 
manage  a  mortgage  if  the  lender  files  for  bankruptcy.  We  have  a 
real  estate  market  glossary  on  how  to  talk  the  talk  for  consumers 
who may not be as versed in that area. We’ve developed a number 
of  educational  materials  regarding  deceptive  mortgage  advertising. 
The CHAIRMAN. Commissioner, I hate to say this, but I’ve got—— 
Ms. HARBOUR. OK. 
The  CHAIRMAN.—minus  2  seconds  left.  And  I  want  Mr.  Himpler 

to answer also. 

Mr.  HIMPLER.  Mr.  Chairman,  welcome  back.  Our  association 
agrees with you that more needs to be done. The Commissioner hit 
the  nail  on  the  head  in  terms  of  resources  being  limited.  We  also, 
through  our  Education  Foundation,  produce  pamphlets  that  are 
similar  to  the  ones  that  the  FTC  does.  And  we  like  the  ones  that 
the FTC does that our companies use in terms of their transactions 
with consumers. 

At the end of the day, however, going back to something that Mr. 
Plunkett  said  regarding  in  particular  cable  TV  and  late-night  TV 
where these ads are bombarding consumers. That is a heck of a lot 
of resources to go up against. We would fully endorse Congress ap-
propriating  additional  funds  for  the  FTC  to  increase  its  enforce-
ment,  and  to  also  promulgate  a  trade  rule  in  terms  of  deceptive 
and misleading advertising in this area, particularly in the state of 
the economy that we’re in right now. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  My  time  is  up.  And  there’s  nobody  else.  So  I’ll 

go right ahead. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Increase  the  resources.  Now  it’s  sort  of  my  im-
pression  you’ve  got  what,  about  1,100  to  1,400  people  working  for 
you including 40 full-time lawyers. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  We  have  1,094  employees  at  the  Federal  Trade 

Commission. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  So  the  question  in  my  mind  is  that  everybody 
says well, we need more resources. As one of our Senators said ear-
lier,  maybe  what’s  needed  is  there  has  to  be  a  different  mentality. 
I mean, there’s obviously not a shortage of people. 

If  we  gave  you  another  300  people  what  would  be  the  chance  or 
the  promise  that  we  would  get  a  big  result?  I  mean,  maybe  being 
more of a cop and less of a monitor mentality is better.

Ms. HARBOUR. When I gave you the figure of 1,094 I believe that 
is  lawyers  and  non  lawyers.  In  the  consumer  protection  area,  the 
area  we’re  speaking  about  now,  we  have  270  lawyers.  But  in  that 
area  we  have  a  very  large  footprint,  and  financial  services  is  one 
of  our  many  important  areas  where  we  protect  the  American  peo-
ple. We have advertising practices, health fraud, Do Not Call, tele-
marketing, rebates, business opportunity scams. 

This  is  a  small,  but  very  important  area  which  we  enforce.  So 
what  we’re  asking  for,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  not  only  additional  re-
sources,  we  are  asking  for  streamlined  APA  rulemaking  authority 
so  that  we  can  strategically  go  in  there  and  stop  this,  so  that  we 
can have rules and standards so that people and fraudsters under-
stand where and what and what they cannot do. 

We  are  asking  for  expanded  civil  penalty  authority  so  that  we 
can  get  monies  from  these  wrongdoers.  And  that  would  serve  as  a 
deterrent. We are asking for rules to implement the Fair Debt Col-
lection Practices Act. 

We  are  also  asking  to  expand  the  authority,  independent  liti-
gating  authority,  so  that  we  can  go  into  district  court  and  ask  for 
our  own  civil  penalties  against  these  wrongdoers.  It’s  not  just  the 
additional  FTEs  and  funding.  It’s  the  additional  authority  so  that 
we can be more effective at what we do. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  OK.  How  many—there  have  not  been  a  great 
many  cases  that  you  have  solved.  There’s  something  like,  you’re 
averaging about 1.5 cases a year. Correct me if I’m wrong. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  The  Chairman  is  never  wrong,  but  that  one 

doesn’t sound quite accurate to me. 

[Laughter.] 
Ms. HARBOUR. 1.5 in what area, sir, in? 
The CHAIRMAN. 25? 
Ms. HARBOUR. Let me just say this. In the area of financial serv-
ices,  what  we’re  talking  about  today,  we  have  been  active  in  this 
area for decades. 

Now  it  is  true.  I  know,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  had  some  concerns 
about the number of cases that have been brought in the mortgage 
rescue  foreclosure  area.  Understand,  the—and  I  want  to  say  that 
we feel that we should be bringing more cases and we are bringing 
more  cases.  In  fact,  in  the  credit  repair  area  right  now  we  have 
nine pending litigations, four confidential investigations going on in 
the  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  area.  We  have  16  confidential  in-
vestigations going on. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Aren’t  there  a  couple  million  people  out  there 
who  are  facing  these  kinds  of  problems?  I’m  just  trying  to  figure 
out what the bulk of the problem is out there, and then how many 
folks that you’re working on. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  It  is  true.  There  are  millions  of  consumers  who 

are in need of help. And there are many bad actors out there. 

But  let  me  put  this  in  context,  Mr.  Chairman.  The  downturn  in 

the economy happened—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes,  that’s  just  going  to  increase  the  number  of 

people. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Yes,  in  2008,  we  saw  the  trends  coming.  And  we 
have been increasing our cases in litigation in this area. But what 
that  means  when  we  see  that  there’s  more  of  a  need  in  the  finan-

cial  services  area,  we  shift  some  of  our  work  from  the  ad  practices 
area,  from  the  Do  Not  Call  area,  that’s  necessary.  And  it  is  being 
done. 

So  there  are  even  more  cases  in  the  pipeline  now.  Last  year,  in 
2008,  in  the  area  of  credit  repair  we  brought  nine  cases.  But  we 
now have 13 cases pending. We will have more. We are on the look-
out. We are being vigilant. 

But  what  it  means  is  we  are  moving  resources  from  some  of  the 

other areas to this very important increase—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  But  how  do  I  deal  with—you’ve  got  13  cases 
pending.  The  recession  is  getting  worse.  That  means  there  are 
going  to  be  more  people  in  trouble,  more  people,  therefore,  getting 
scammed. As the people in trouble go up, the number of fraudsters 
will go up. 

So why am I meant to be impressed by 13? 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  Well  I’m  definitely  not  trying  to  impress  you  be-

cause I said we certainly could do—— 

The CHAIRMAN. However you interpret the question. 
Ms. HARBOUR.—Can do more here. But as I had said earlier, we 
approach  these  cases  in  a  three-prong  manner.  We  do  it  by  tar-
geted  law  enforcement.  We  also  do  it  by  consumer  outreach  and 
education. And we try to do it with policy and where the law needs 
to be changed so we can be more prophylactic. 

In the area of foreclosure rescue scams we have a task force that 
we have joined with. We have seven task forces that we have either 
joined  or  created  with  state  and  local  officials.  We  are  in  some  of 
the  areas  that  are  hardest  hit.  And  we’re  trying  to  be  strategic  in 
that way. 

We  have  a  task  force  in  Atlanta,  Tampa,  Cleveland,  Michigan. 
We’re working with the local enforcers on trying to see trends. And 
work to identify solutions. 

Yes, we will be increasing some of the cases that we bring in this 
area.  But  as  I  was  saying,  this  acute  downturn  in  the  economy 
happened  September  2008.  We  saw  this  trend  coming.  We  imme-
diately started shifting more resources to this area. 

We  have  a  large  footprint.  And  when  we  shift  resources  to  this 
area,  we  bring  resources  from  some  of  the  other  areas.  We’re  say-
ing we would like a little more resources. And we would like great-
er authority under the law to be more—— 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  hear  your  words.  The  Chairman  of  the  Con-
sumer  Protection  Subcommittee  is  here,  Senator  Pryor.  And  you 
may have some questions. I’m sure you do. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  your 

leadership. 

The CHAIRMAN. Take your time. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you. As you know we all had to rush over 

and vote. And we appreciate the panel for being here. 

Ms. Harbour, let me ask you if I may about the state and Federal 
relationship.  It’s  my  understanding,  I’ve  been  in  contact  with  my 
state’s  Attorney  General,  Dustin  McDaniel.  It’s  our  understanding 
that there is a good working relationship there. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

52 

I’d  like  to  get  your  thoughts  on  that  relationship  with  all  the 
state  attorneys  general  and  other  state  agencies  and  entities  out 
there  that  you  work  with.  And  also  would  like  your  ideas  on  how 
to improve it if it needs to be improved. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Senator,  you’re  asking  the  right  person.  I  was  a 
state  enforcer  for  13  years.  And  I  believe  I  was  in  the  New  York 
Attorney  General’s  office  when  you  were  Attorney  General.  So  I 
think the Federal/State relationship is just swell. 

We work together very well. In fact in the area of mortgage fore-
closure rescue scams, as I was telling the Chairman, we are work-
ing  with  a  number  of  state  attorneys  general  and  local  and  state 
officials on our task force where we’re trying to fight mortgage res-
cue scams. We have done this in some of the areas that are hardest 
hit—Atlanta, Tampa, Cleveland. 

I believe we have a Southeast regional office that is working with 
a  state  attorney  general  to  investigate  and  prosecute.  I  think  that 
we  should  always  keep  the  door  open  for  joint,  parallel  Federal/ 
state investigations. I think it helps the American consumer. 

You  have  more  cops  on  the  beat  looking  out  for  their  interests 
at  the  state  level  and  at  the  Federal  level.  And  I  am  in  favor  of 
a  strong  and  healthy  working  relationship  between  state  and  Fed-
eral Government. 

Senator PRYOR. Let me ask this. You talked about how when you 
saw  the  recession  and  the  financial  crisis  happening  in  late  last 
year  you  shifted  resources.  Do  you  need  more  resources  in  your 
agency? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Absolutely,  Senator.  Absolutely.  As  I  was  telling 
the  Chairman,  we  have  a  very  large  footprint  at  our  agency.  We 
do quite a bit. 

We have 270 lawyers in the Consumer Protection area. And we— 
financial  services  is  one  of  many  areas  that  we  enforce.  And  just 
to name a few, telemarketing, business opportunity, pretexting, Do 
Not  Call,  our  data  security  and  identity  theft  cases.  We  all  have— 
these are very important areas as well. 

But  in  order  to  respond  to  the  unprecedented  number  of  con-
sumers  who  are  at  risk,  in  harm’s  way,  we  just  need  more  re-
sources.  It  is  frustrating  that  we  cannot  bring  100  cases  to  help 
consumers in foreclosure. We don’t have the resources to bring 100. 
We  try  to  be  targeted  in—well,  maybe  I  shouldn’t  say  that.  Maybe 
we can. 

We’re  looking.  But  we  know  that  we  want  to  be  even  more  vigi-
lant. And we are looking to bring more cases. And we feel that we 
will do more and we want to do more in this area. 

Senator PRYOR. Let me ask on the resource issue. Do you see the 
states  as  part  of  your  resources,  kind  of  an  extension  of  what  you 
can do out there in the states? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Absolutely.  In  fact,  in  the  mortgage  foreclosure 
rescue  area  what  we’ve  seen  is  that  a  lot  of  these  companies  are 
local  and  regional  in  nature.  In  fact  some  of  the  scammers  are  op-
erating  in  actual  neighborhoods.  And  the  state  attorneys  general, 
you  guys  are  the  cops  on  the  beat.  You’re  the  closest  to  the 
scammers. 

And  when  we  partner  I  think  it  provides  more  effective  law  en-
forcement to the American consumer. So I would advocate for hav-

ing  an  even  closer  relationship  with  the  state  attorneys  general  in 
this area. 

53 

Senator  PRYOR.  You  mentioned  the  task  force  that  you  have  on 
financial—mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  scams  task  force.  And  I  as-
sume  you  have  a  pretty  healthy  representation  of  states  there  on 
that task force. Has that been working well? I mean, are there les-
sons learned there? Things we need to be doing better? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  I  think  the  task  force  is  working  very,  very  well. 
As  I  said  it’s  operating  in  Atlanta  and  Tampa,  Cleveland,  Michi-
gan,  Northern  California,  Los  Angeles  and  Illinois.  Perhaps  there 
is  even  room  to  expand  it.  It  is  a  seven-region  task  force,  but  if 
there  is  interest  by  the  attorneys  general  in  other  regions.  I  can 
say that the FTC would be interested in joining those as well. One 
of  the  most  important  things  is  getting  the  word  out  to  the  Amer-
ican  consumer  about  some  of  these  scams.  Also  bringing  targeted 
law enforcement and working with the state attorneys general. 

Senator  PRYOR.  The  Chairman  has  mentioned  that  one  of  the 
things that the Committee should be working on is the FTC Reau-
thorization bill this year. Do you feel like the FTC needs more stat-
utory authority in this area or do you have enough? It’s just a mat-
ter of resources. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  It’s  both.  What  we’d  like?  We  would  like  stream-
lined APA rulemaking authority. We would like expanded civil pen-
alty  authority.  We  would  like  rules  to  implement  the  Fair  Debt 
Collection  Practices  Act.  And  we  would  also  like  to  expand  the 
FTC’s independent litigating authority. 

This way we could go into court, district court, and we could seek 
injunctive  equitable  relief  and  we  could  seek  civil  penalties.  This 
would  give  us  more  enforcement  tools  to  help  the  American  con-
sumer.  Even  if  we  were  to  get  a  lot  more  resources  today  without 
this additional APA rulemaking authority and civil penalty author-
ity,  we  would  not  be  as  effective  as  if  we  got  the  whole  package. 
Senator PRYOR. I know that I have other colleagues waiting. But 
I  did  just  have  one  last  question  for  you  Madam  Commissioner. 
And  that  is  that,  as  an  example,  West  Virginia  and  Arkansas  and 
other  states  have  large  rural  areas.  And  Internet  access  is  hard 
and  sometimes  getting  information  in  those  areas  is  harder  than 
it is in more urban, densely populated areas. 

How do you feel your outreach is going with regard to rural areas 
and  with  people  who  don’t  have  access  to  the  Internet  or  can’t  af-
ford access to the Internet? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  And  just  to  address  that  question  briefly.  The 
Commission  gets  information  out  to  consumers  in  a  number  of 
ways. And in states that perhaps are not—where the digital divide 
is in play and there is not high-speed broadband and other Internet 
access  for  your  consumers,  we  can  actually  send  our  pamphlets  to 
consumers or they can call our help line, our toll-free help line. But 
we  also  work  with  community-based  groups.  10,000  community- 
based groups that distribute our information to members, to clients 
and to constituents. 

We  also  work  with  libraries  all  across  the  Nation.  And  if  you 
have  an  idea  that  we  haven’t  thought  of  to  help  disseminate  the 
word to your constituents and to your consumers, we would be very 
happy to hear it. Our education and outreach at the Federal Trade

Commission is award-winning. Our information reaches consumers 
and it helps them. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  Committee  appreciates  Senator  Pryor.  I 

want to call on Senator Lautenberg. 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thanks,  Mr.  Chairman.  It’s  so  discour-
aging when we look at what’s happening to our people by the forces 
at  work  in  terms  of  the  losses  of  homes  and  property  and  assets 
and spirit. It’s a terrible dilemma for us. 

And among the worst things is to perpetuate the abuse by having 
these  scoundrels  take  advantage  of  our  people.  And  Mr.  Plunkett, 
you  don’t  have  to  just  see  the  tube  at  night.  I  don’t  watch  a  lot  of 
television  but  during  the  day  we  kind  of  watch  the  news  and  even 
there the advertisements really kind of had me scratching my head 
and say how are you going to do it? You’ve got all these things and 
just one thing and we’ll take care of it and get you up to date and 
so forth. 

And Mrs. Dix, we heard what you had to say. It was very impor-

tant that you brought that experience here. 

And Mr. Chairman, I’m delighted to welcome to this panel Com-
missioner  Pamela  Jones  Harbour.  We’ve  worked  together.  And  I 
know  how  concerned  and  industrious  you  are  about  trying  to  stem 
the tide of these fraudulent happenings. 

So  the  witnesses  were  valuable.  And  it  seemed  like  we  weren’t 

listening. But we will be reading. And we did listen also. 

It’s  difficult  I  know,  Commissioner  Harbour,  for  most  consumers 
to  know  the  difference  between  a  scam  and  a  legitimate  program. 
People  are  desperate.  They’re  reaching  out  for  help  however  they 
can  get  it.  And  to  watch  their  obligations  mount  in  front  of  them 
while  their  opportunities  for  income  decline.  So  I’m  pleased  that 
the  FTC  has  implemented  outreach  programs  to  try  to  tell  people 
about the legitimate resources available to them and warning them 
about these possible scams. 

When did the outreach efforts begin? When did the FTC start to 

be alert to this? 

Ms. HARBOUR. We are always reaching out to consumers. Now in 
the  financial  services  area  we  have  always  had  educational  mate-
rials. When the scams shift and when we learn about other aspects 
of fraudulent behavior going on out in the marketplace then we tai-
lor our educational brochures to those activities. 

In  fact,  I  believe  that  we  are  going  to  update  all  of  our  relevant 
written  materials,  and  develop  what  is  called  a  micro-site  on  our 
website. And this is going to focus on very extensive tips on saving, 
spending,  budgeting,  dealing  with  debt,  debt  collection,  debt  nego-
tiations,  settlement  repair,  advance  fee  loans,  and  your  home.  It’s 
going to be very, very comprehensive. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Has  the  volume  of  effort  picked  up  sub-

stantially or has this been an ongoing program that—— 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Our  consumer  education  is  ongoing.  In  fact  I 
think  the  more  we  do  it,  the  better  we  get  at  it.  And  we’ve  won 
awards for this.

55 

And  as  I  said,  we’re  small  but  mighty.  We  only  have  staff  in 
seven  states.  Yet,  we  disseminate  absolutely  nationwide.  And  I 
think maybe even outside of our borders as well. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. How effective do you think it’s been? How 

do you measure something like that? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Well  I  don’t  have  the  stats  about  how  many 
awards  my  staff  has  won  on  their  education  and  outreach.  But  I 
know  that  they’ve  won  some  major  awards  for  the  substance,  the 
effectiveness  and  the  thoroughness  of  our  education  and  our  out-
reach to the American consumer. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Your testimony talks about the FTC’s dis-
tribution  of  educational  materials.  And  it  recommends  steps  that 
consumers  can  take  if  they  have  trouble  meeting  their  mortgage 
payments.  How  do  you  distribute  these  things?  How  do  you  get 
widespread coverage? 

Ms. HARBOUR. Again, we have relationships with 10,000 commu-
nity-based  groups  that  will  distribute  our  information  to  members 
and  constituents  and  clients.  In  fact  we  also  have  a  relationship 
with Members of Congress, I believe. We make our materials avail-
able for your newsletters. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  don’t  want  to  keep  you  on  this  but  per-
haps  you  could  give  us,  send  in  a  report  about  how  you  measure 
effectiveness because those are the things we talk about constantly. 
Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  might.  I  have  a  question  for  Mrs.  Dix.  May 

I do that? 

The CHAIRMAN. You may. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Mrs. Dix, you testified that if you had not 
called  your  state’s  attorney  general  to  find  a  company  to  help  you, 
your home would have been lost? 

Mrs. DIX. Yes, it would have. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Had you heard of this company before, this 

Mountain State Justice before calling the attorney general? 

Mrs. DIX. No, sir. I didn’t. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Did  you  get  any  material  from  your  mort-
gage  lender  suggesting  that  you  try  to  contact  a  legitimate  fore-
closure rescue company? 
Mrs. DIX. No, I didn’t. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  So  you  felt  like  you  were  left  hopeless  out 

Mrs.  DIX.  Yes,  until  somebody  told  me  about  the  attorney  gen-

there? 

eral. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. We’re happy that you did finally get some 
relief  there.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  my  opening  statement 
be included in the record. 

The CHAIRMAN. So ordered. 
[The prepared statement of Senator Lautenberg follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding today’s hearing on consumer protection. 
Let  me  begin  by  welcoming  our  witnesses,  particularly  Commissioner  Pamela 
Jones Harbour, whose home is in New Jersey and understands how tough the credit 
crunch and economic slowdown have been on our state. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

Commissioner Harbour is a strong advocate for consumers at the FTC and I want 
to  thank  the  Chairman  for  bringing  her  here  to  testify  today.  This  is  clearly  a  crit-
ical time for our government to be standing up for consumers. 

The  unemployment  rate  in  our  country  is  the  highest  it’s  been  in  16  years.  And 
those men and women who do have a job are working longer, working harder—and 
after getting less for their labor. That means more Americans are struggling to pay 
their mortgages, which is one reason New Jersey’s foreclosure rate increased 75 per-
cent from 2007 to 2008. 

It  means  more  Americans  are  struggling  to  pay  their  expenses,  from  credit  cards 
to utilities, which means bills are piling up and collection agencies are calling. And 
because they’re vulnerable and will take any help they can get, Americans are more 
susceptible to scams. 

Scam  artists  that  have  no  problem  taking  advantage  of  anyone,  anywhere,  any-
time—the.  people  running  foreclosure  scams,  for  example—are  coming  out  of  the 
woodwork.  Some  companies  have  demanded  illegal  up-front  payments  from  con-
sumers  for  their  services—and  then  never  deliver  what  they  promised  or  what  the 
cash-strapped consumer paid for. 

We must crack down on these crooks and the scams they are running. 
I know this Committee will do its part. Mr, Chairman, I look forward to working 
with you in partnership with Commissioner Harbour and the FTC to protect Ameri-
cans from these criminal scams. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 
Thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing.  Thank  you  to  all  of  you  for 
being here. 

Thank  you,  Mrs.  Dix,  for  sharing  your  story.  And  Commissioner 
Harbour, it’s good to see you again. And Mr. Cox, from Minnesota, 
thank  you.  He  actually  has  done  several  forums  in  Minnesota  on 
consumer  issues  with  me.  And  is  a  renowned  expert  in  our  state. 
So thank you for doing that. 

I  actually  wanted  to  ask  you,  Mr.  Cox,  as  my  home  state  guy  a 
few  questions  about  your  work.  When  you  look  at  the  relationship 
between  the—I  know  you’ve  done  a  lot  of  work  in  the  foreclosure 
area,  between  foreclosure  rescue  fraud  and  other  types  of  fraud 
we’ve been discussing today such as credit repair scams and credit 
and debt management. What is the relationship between those that 
you see, the foreclosure fraud and some of the other kinds of credit 
repair scams that we see? 

Mr.  COX.  Thank  you,  Senator  Klobuchar.  I  thought  as  Min-

nesota’s only Senator you might get more time. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  That’s  right.  And  I  am  asking  the  Chair-
man  for  10  minutes.  I’m  actually  considering  amending  the  D.C. 
Voting Rights bill to give me two votes. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Because  we  sort  of  have  taxation  without 

representation. But please, go on, Mr. Cox. 

Mr.  COX.  Alright.  Foreclosure  rescue  scams  really  fall  into  two 
categories.  And  almost  all  of  them  you  can  put  into  these  arche-
types  and  it  works.  Even  though  market  values  are  tanking,  there 
are  people,  particularly  elderly  people,  who  are  still  in  foreclosure 
who  have  equity  in  their  homes  and  the  reconveyance  scams  are 
still occurring. 

That  doesn’t  have  much  relationship  to  these  debt  settlement 
and  credit  repair  problems.  That’s  its  own  unique  thing  and  re-

quires legal services attorneys and others who can help individuals 
as  well  as  these  state  laws.  The  foreclosure  consultant  scam  is  a 
very  parallel  problem  from  a  consumer  protection  regulatory  per-
spective to the debt settlement, debt management problem. 

It’s  a  vital  service.  People  need  foreclosure  prevention  services. 
And  the  National  Federation  of  Consumer  Counselors  groups  do  a 
fantastic  job.  I’ve  worked  with  those  people  for  many,  many  years 
in helping borrowers in foreclosure. 

The  problem  is  that  the  complexity  of  the  transaction  and  the 
difficulty of getting accurate information to people makes it so that 
there’s  also  going  to  be  these  scams.  So  the  foreclosure  consultant 
scams, and the debt settlement scams are very similar. I think that 
we  need  the  kinds  of  swift  rulemaking  and  standard  setting  in 
order to address that. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  What  do  you  think  the  best,  briefly,  what 
are  the  best  provisions  you  think  in  Minnesota  law  or  other  laws 
around the country that would be helpful for Federal law? 

Mr.  COX.  Well  the  foreclosure  consultant  law  has  one  key  provi-
sion.  You  don’t  get  to  take  anyone’s  money  up  front.  You  have  to 
provide  the  service  before  you  can  get  the  money  because  almost 
all  the  legitimate  counselors  are  non-profit  that  doesn’t  affect  the 
legitimate service providers. 

It,  however,  prevents  people  from  getting  their  money  taken  be-
cause  at  the  end  of  the  process  they  just  won’t  pay  if  they’re  in  a 
situation like Mrs. Dix. So that’s the key provision. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  That’s  not  in  the  Federal  law  right  now? 
This  idea  of  having—that  you  wouldn’t  have  to  pay  up  front  for 
services? 

Mr. COX. There is no Federal law specifically related to that. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Yes.  OK.  Another  idea  that  you  would  like 

Mr.  COX.  Well,  there  was  a  provision  in  the,  I  believe  one  of  the 
states  passed  a  law  that  I  thought  added  an  interesting  provision 
which  made  these  organizations  fiduciaries,  which  again  makes  it 
easier  to  bring  these  legal  actions.  And  also  we  need  to  redefine 
what  foreclosure  is  to  bring  in  people  who  are  in  distress,  which 
those laws did as well which brings more of the services within the 
context. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  OK.  Very  good.  Thank  you.  Mrs.  Dix,  just 
from your practical experience what do you think would be the best 
way  to  get  information  out  to  people  both  so  they’re  not—I  mean 
we’ve heard a lot from our leaders here of how they think it should 
be done. But if you think about your circumstance and other people 
you  know,  what’s  the  easiest  way  to  try  to  get  that  information  so 
you call the right person? 

Mrs.  DIX.  I  think  maybe  going  out  to  the  public,  TVs,  more  ad-

to see? 

vertising, a little bit more. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  So  that  you  can  actually  see  it.  You’re 
watching  a  show  and  you  see  a  commercial.  Hey,  if  you’re  in  this 
kind of trouble watch out and call this number? 

Mrs. DIX. Right. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Because  I  haven’t  seen  that  much  of  that. 
Mrs. DIX. I haven’t either.

Senator KLOBUCHAR. I’ve seen a lot of like prescription drug com-
mercials,  but  I  haven’t  seen  a  lot  of  this  trouble  that  people  have. 
Alright. Good. 

Mr.  Himpler,  AFSA  is  the—I  know  the  work  that  you  do,  your 
national  trade  association  for  the  consumer  credit  industry.  I  be-
lieve  that  my  staff  talked  to  you  about  this  before.  But  could  you 
talk  about  how  you’re  good  actor  people  that  work  with  you  that 
haven’t  done  bad  stuff,  how  they’ve  been  impacted  by  the  bad  ac-
tors? And how you think you solve that? 

Mr.  HIMPLER.  Thank  you,  Senator.  I  think  everything  that  both 
Mrs.  Dix  and  the  Commissioner  and  Mr.  Cox  have  mentioned  is 
right  on  the  money  because  when  these  scam  artists  take  advan-
tage  of  consumers  like  Mrs.  Dix  and  often  times  they  encourage 
consumers  to  end  all  communications  with  lenders.  Then  as  lend-
ers,  the  lenders  can’t  find  these  organizations  to  work  out  any-
thing. 

So  the  lender  is  left  without  any  way  to  do  any  sort  of  work  out 
with  the  consumer.  Everybody  loses.  The  consumer’s  credit  falls 
into  disrepair.  And  a  true  accurate  depiction  of  what  their  credit 
standing  is  left  disabled  by  this  entire  transaction  with  credit  re-
pair organizations like these. 

So  we  do  need  to  do  a  better  job  of  getting  the  information  out 
to  the  consumers,  PSAs,  the  brochures  that  the  FTC  and  other  or-
ganizations  and  our  education  foundation  put  out.  But  in  these 
tough economic times, not enough can be done in this area. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Alright.  Very  good.  Thank  you,  all  of  you. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you,  Senator.  Senator  Begich?  And  then

Senator  BEGICH.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  Is  that

Thank you all very much. And I get the bird’s eye view here. I’m

Senator  BEGICH.  The  Chairman  did  offer  me  to  move  up.  And  I 

good. 

The CHAIRMAN. Can you see the witnesses? 
Senator BEGICH. I like this. I feel like I could be a witness or ask 

questions. So it depends on what’s going on. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BEGICH.  So  that’s  a  real  little  kids  table.  That’s  very 

Let  me  ask.  And  Mr.  Chairman  we  rode  on  the  train  just  a  sec-
ond ago. And I’m going to give this for the record. This is an inter-
esting—this  is  one  of  those  promotional  cards  from  a  very  rep-
utable  organization,  a  company.  And  the  effective  annual  percent-
age rate is 51.65 percent. 

I  mean,  you  know,  most  people  would  look  at  this  company  and 
not consider them, you know part of the scam. But the fact is that 
you  have  that  kind  of  interest  rate  is  a  loan  shark  rate.  I  mean, 
it’s outrageous.

So  I’ll  give  this  if  I  can  to  the  record.  It’s  just  an  unbelievable, 
you know, I consider it a scam. But I’m sure the company that as-
sociated  with  the  credit  card  company  didn’t  think  it  was.  It  was 
a promotional 51 percent. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  information  will  be  included  in  the  record.

Senator  BEGICH.  There  we  go.  Thank  you.  And  I’ll  give  this  for 

the record. 

Does  the  FTC  have  kind  of  the,  for  the  financial  advisors  or  the 
people that are helping folks get out of the non-profits, do you have 
almost  like  a  Good  Housekeeping  seal,  someone  that  you  can  turn 
to? You know, when I buy a toaster I know a UL is a good product. 
Without  the  UL  it’s  a  piece  of  junk.  If  you  have  that  I’m  going  to 
be frank with you, I never hear it. 

And  so  do  you  have  something  that  a  consumer  can  say,  you 
know,  if  you’re  not  this  than  I’m  not  even  going  to  waste  my  time 
talking to you as a work-out person.

Ms. HARBOUR. Senator, you don’t hear about it because we don’t 
have  that.  We  do  not  put  a  Good  Housekeeping-type  stamp  of  ap-
proval on businesses or on brokers or on lenders. 

Senator  BEGICH.  I’m  more  interested  in  the  people  that  are  try-
ing  to  help  out  folks  to  get  out  of  the  situations  they’re  in.  You 
know  you  hear  all  the  advertisements.  Come  to  us,  we’ll  solve  all 
your  credit  problems  then  sometimes  they’re  scamming  you  or 
they’re not. 

And then there are some of the good ones, the non-profit organi-
zations that I’m familiar with are very good organizations. But you 
know,  how  does  the  consumer—I  mean,  I  heard  an  ad  a  couple 
days ago. And I thought, wow, this is a good company. Then I find 
out it really is another business trying to take your money. 

Ms. HARBOUR. No, that’s an excellent question. And as I was pre-
paring  for  this  hearing  I  asked  myself  that.  As  a  consumer  how 
would  the  American  consumer  know  whether  these  companies  are 
legitimate  or  not?  And  then  I  thought  about  it  and  I  went  over 
some things and I came up with three ways. 

First is you contact your state attorney general. 
Senator BEGICH. Assuming that a consumer knows that. 
Ms. HARBOUR. Assuming, that’s right. 
Senator BEGICH. It’s not a high likelihood. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  Or  you  contact  the  Better  Business  Bureau  and 
see  if  there  were  any  complaints  about  that  particular  business  or 
you  could  go  to  your  local  consumer  protection  agency.  But  the 
issue  is  that  we  need  to  educate  the  American  consumer  about 
these  options.  Otherwise  they  will  fall  prey  to  these  scam  artists. 
And  they  will  fall  prey  in  greater  numbers  because  the  American 
consumer really is in financial straits now. 

Senator BEGICH. But do you think that you have a role? 
Ms. HARBOUR. Absolutely. 
Senator  BEGICH.  To  create  that  kind  of  list?  Because  the  con-

sumer—— 

Ms. HARBOUR. Oh. 
Senator  BEGICH.  I  mean,  you  know,  the  consumer  is  busy.  I 
mean,  Mrs.  Dix  your  whole  issue.  I  mean  you  were  dealing  every 
minute  of  your  life  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  solve  this  problem 
and  by  a  chance  and  circumstance  you  were  able  to  be  told  to  call 
the AG. 

The average consumer—— 
Ms. HARBOUR. Senator, my absolutely was, absolutely we have a 

role, but not absolutely creating that list. 

Senator BEGICH. Why not? 
Ms. HARBOUR. I would push back on that. 
Senator  BEGICH.  I  know  more  about  toys  and  what’s  good  and 
bad  from  the  Federal  Government  than  I  do  about  what  consumer 
organizations. 

Ms. HARBOUR. Well how I would answer that question? Through 
our  outreach  and  our  education,  we  can  get  at  that  through  the 
back  door.  For  instance,  with  the  fraudulent  mortgage  foreclosure 
rescue  scams  we  have  some  red-flag  pieces  of  advice  that  we  have 
available to every consumer in America telling them what to watch 
out for. For instance we say avoid any business that guarantees to

62 

stop foreclosure processes, no matter what. Usually they’re going to 
be fraudulent if they say 100 percent certain. 

We  say  avoid  any  businesses  that  are  going  to  instruct  you,  the 
consumer,  not  to  pay  your  lender  or  your  lawyer  or  your  housing 
counselor.  Any  business,  that  collects  a  high,  upfront  fee  before 
they  do  anything  for  you  between  $300  to  $5,000,  that’s  the  way 
we reach the American consumer. 

Senator BEGICH. Let me ask you something. I have to watch your 
clock  there  because  I  don’t  have  one.  So  I  think  I  have  about  30 
seconds left. 

So  let  me  try  to  ask.  I  know  you  mentioned  the  success  of  your 
education  was  measured  by  awards  you’ve  received.  But  how  do 
you measure from the consumer end, the real consumer? 

How  do  you  know  it’s  reaching  them  other  than,  you  know, 
you’ve  got  some  awards  for  good  advertisements  and  so  forth? 
What data can you show me? What data can you show me that con-
sumers who needed this information actually got it in their hands? 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  That’s  a  very  good  question.  And  what  it  sounds 
like  you’re  asking  for  do  we  have  any  empirical  research  that  has 
actually  seen  the  effect  of  our  work.  I  want  to  get  back  to  you  on 
that. 

That could be a study that we do. How do we measure how effec-
tive  we  are?  Certainly  our  desire  and  our,  you  know  and  our  zeal 
to  help  the  American  consumer  is  there,  but  you  need  more  of  a 
metric than that. 

Senator BEGICH. Right. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  And  that’s  a  very  good  question.  And  let  me  get 

back to you. 

Senator  BEGICH.  OK.  I’d  be  very  curious.  I  know  that  we  do  a 
lot  of  that.  I’m  a  former  mayor  and  we,  you  know,  just  figure  out 
effectiveness  of  the  products  and  delivery  of  information.  It’s  all 
about which consumer group we’re trying to hit. And then what re-
sult we get out of it. 

And  again  that  would  be  very  interesting.  I  have  some  other 
questions,  but  I  know  my  time  is  up.  And  I’ll  just  wait  if  there’s 
another round. 

Ms. HARBOUR. Thank you. 
Senator BEGICH. Thank you very much. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Begich. Senator Warner? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK WARNER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator  WARNER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  panel,  I’m 
sorry  I  missed  the  first  half  of  this  hearing.  But  I  want  to  follow 
up  on  some  of  my  colleagues’  comments,  Senator  Begich  and  Sen-
ator Klobuchar. 

Commissioner  Harbour,  I  understand  that  you’ve  got  a  report 
coming  out  today  based  off  some  workshops  you’ve  been  doing 
about the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. 

Ms. HARBOUR. That’s correct. 
Senator  WARNER.  And  as  we  talk  about  how  we  inform  con-
sumers of what assistance is out there, the flip side of that is often-
times  how  do  some  of  these  debt  collection  groups  actually  legally 
check  the  box  that  they’ve  notified  the  consumer?  And  one  of  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

63 

things  I  saw  or  at  least  referenced  to  in  the  testimony  that  you 
were  talking  about  using  new  technologies.  And  I’ve  heard  some 
kind of wild stories about people saying they’ve, the debt collection 
folks  have  met  the  notification  requirements  by  using  Facebook 
and  using,  you  know,  some  technologies  that  might  not  be  tradi-
tional. 

Have  you  all  thought  through  from  both  a  kind  of  an  outreach- 
to-consumer  standpoint  and  then  how  you’re  going  to  use  these 
new  technologies,  particularly  web-based.  And  from  the  reverse 
standpoint  of  what  would  qualify  as  legal  notice  going  back  out 
from the debt collectors to the consumer how robust these organiza-
tions  can  be  in  using  these  new  technologies  on  the  outward  con-
tacting? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Our  report  that  issued  today  was  a  result  of  a 
two-day  workshop  that  we  held  last  year.  And  the  report  contains 
a number of recommendations, legislative recommendations to pro-
tect  consumers.  What  we  found  from  our  workshop,  we  found  two 
problems. 

Well,  we  found  more  than  that,  but  the  two  problems  I  want  to 
identify are that debt collectors have inadequate information when 
they try to collect from consumers. So in our report what we’re rec-
ommending  is  that  the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act  be 
amended  regarding  those  validation  notices.  Those  are  the  notices 
that are required to be sent out by the collectors. 

But  what  we’re  recommending  is  that  those  notices  should  dis-
close the name of the original creditor because a lot of times there’s 
inadequate  information  that’s  being  given  to  the  consumers  by  the 
original  creditor.  We  recommend  that  the  debt  be  broken  down  by 
principal,  by  interest  and  by  any  other  charges.  This  way  the  con-
sumer  knows  what  it  is  that  they’re  being  asked  to  provide,  we 
think that this would solve the inadequate information problem. 

The  second  issue  that  I  wanted  to  talk  about  that  was  raised  in 
the  workshop  was  that  debt  collectors  generally  don’t  provide  ade-
quate  information  to  consumers  about  their  rights  under  the  Fair 
Debt Collection Practices Act. So what our report is recommending 
is that the notices that are sent should include the two rights that 
consumers  have  under  the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices  Act.  And 
that  is,  first,  and  a  lot  of  consumers  do  not  know  this,  the  right 
to demand that the debt collector cease communicating with them. 
And  then  second,  the  right  to  be  free  of  attempts  until  the  debt  is 
verified.  And  consumers  can—they  have  to  ask  for  that  in  writing. 
But  as  far  as  the  specific  part  of  your  question  that  talks  about 
new technologies. We also recommend that the FDCPA is amended 
to prohibit debt collectors from collecting—contacting consumers by 
way of their mobile phones unless the consumer says, yes, you may 
contact  me  by  this  way  of  new  technology.  And  the  reason  we  be-
lieve  this  is  important  is  because  a  lot  of  times  the  debt  collectors 
will  call  up  or  text  the  consumer  and  the  consumers  have  to  pay 
for the text. 

Senator WARNER. Right. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  It  doesn’t  make  any  sense.  So  unless  a  consumer 
wants  to  be  solicited  by  a  debt  collector  and  wants  to  pay  for  the 
charge  on  the  mobile  phone  we’re  recommending  that  it  not  hap-
pen. And I guess that’s with all the other new technologies——

Senator WARNER. Well think about it if you, you know, the rami-
fications  if  you  were  to  make  a  posting  on  Facebook  or  a  posting 
on  some  of  these  community-based  sites.  It  seems  to  me  that  this 
should  be  a  relationship  between  the  debt  collector  and  the  con-
sumer.  And  until  it  is  fully  verified,  all  the  debt,  you  don’t  need  it 
to  be,  in  effect,  broadcast  widely  and  distributed  widely  over  some 
of the common shared sites like Facebook. 

Ms. HARBOUR. And also, Senator, the—— 
Senator  WARNER.  So  have  you  looked  at  how  you  might  restrict 
the use of some of these technologies. It might be good communica-
tion  devices  but  actually  might  be  sharing  this  information  on  a 
broader level or a more inappropriate—— 

Ms. HARBOUR. Well, I think that that’s an area that we are look-
ing at. And if we were able to amend the Fair Debt Collection Prac-
tices  Act  that  is  something  that  we  certainly  would  be  giving  a  lot 
of thought to and coming up with something legislatively. 

Senator WARNER. Great. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  Also  there  are  statutory  penalties  that  have  not 
been amended since 1977. So we would want to look at that as well 
and recommend that they’re upgraded. 

Senator  WARNER.  Great  new  tools,  but  they  can  be  abused  in 

terms of some of these new technology communication devices. 

Ms. HARBOUR. Yes. 
Senator  WARNER.  So  I’d  love  to  hear  back  some  more  on  that. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Warner. Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator  THUNE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  for  holding  the  hear-
ing  on  a  topic  that’s  often  overlooked  and  is  a  consequence  of  the 
economic  recession  and  that’s  consumer  protection  laws  and  how 
those  impact  people  out  there  who  are  struggling.  I  think  anybody 
in this economy whether you’re a factory worker or a senior citizen, 
somebody who is trying to live on a reduced income, trying to con-
tinue  to  make  a  mortgage  payment.  Everyone  feels  the  effects  of 
the recession. 

And  I  think  one  of  the  consequences  of  that  or  affects  of  that  is 
and we’re seeing that is the historically high number of home fore-
closures,  increasing  number  of  consumers  and  small  businesses 
who  are  filing  for  bankruptcy.  And  any  time  you  have  those  kinds 
of  things  going  on,  a  record  number  of  consumers  who  are  facing 
financial  distress,  the  risk  of  fraud  and  abuse  is  greatly  elevated. 
And  so  particularly  in  these  times  it’s  important  that  consumer 
protection laws are in force as intended by the Congress. 

I think it’s important that consumers be aware of the protections 
that  are  afforded  them  under  the  law.  And  that  those  who  seek 
debt  counseling  and  financial  management  services  are  not  victim 
to  the  fraudulent  activities  of  bad  actors  that  are  out  there  in  the 
debt  servicing  sector.  And  I  guess  what  I  would  like  to  come  back 
to  is  something  the  Senator  from  Alaska  was  talking  about  and 
that  is  if  there  isn’t  this  sort  of  gold-standard  list  that  exists  out 
there  of  good  actors  is  it  possible  to  work  with  some  of  the  people

at  the  table  and  based  on  some  of  the  testimony  this  morning  to 
put together a series of sort of voluntary standards? 

Not something that we would necessarily legislate, but that peo-
ple  could  go  to  and  say,  OK,  if  you  meet  these  certain  standards 
you  get  on  this  list.  You  get  on  this—you  become  someone  who  is 
recognized  as  being  a  legitimate,  high  quality  actor  with  regard  to 
this industry. And is that something that might be considered? 

I mean I think there has been some good testimony this morning 
about  some  of  the  suggestions  of  things  that  could  be  a  part  of 
those  included  in  that  list  of  standards.  Is  that  something  that 
would make sense? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  My  response  to  that  is  I  would  like  to  work  with 
or  speak  to  the  Better  Business  Bureau.  My  sense  is  that  is  more 
in line with what they perhaps would do. Would that be helpful to 
the  American  consumer  to  know,  which  businesses  are  legitimate 
and which businesses are not? Absolutely, especially in this climate 
of economic downturn, absolutely. 

And  perhaps,  you  know,  that’s  something  we  can  look  into  and 
see  if  it’s  not  our  agency  who  comes  up  with  that  list  if  there  is 
an agency that can do that. So we can get back to you on that, Sen-
ator. 

Senator THUNE. OK. 
Well  and  I  don’t  know.  Even  if  it’s  not—I’m  not  saying  it  nec-
essarily,  the  Better  Business  Bureau  is  good  too.  And  they  maybe 
can compile some of that type of data already. 

But  if  the  FTC,  which  is  the  agency  of  government  that  most 
consumers  look  to  for  these  types  of  protections  were  to  compile  a 
list based upon a sort of agreed upon set of standards that are con-
sidered to be, the gold standard, so to speak and again, based upon 
recommendations  from  people  like  those  who  have  testified  this 
morning.  That  I  guess  was  I’m  just  throwing  that  out  there  as  an 
idea  because  I’m  not  trying  to  suggest  that  Congress  ought  to  get 
in  and  legislate  those  standards.  But  that  there  are  things  based 
upon  industry  input  that  say  these  are  good  actors  and  these  are 
the things that good actors do, you know, just a thought. 

Ms. HARBOUR. So you’re saying a best practices list? 
Senator THUNE. Yes. Yes. Exactly. 
Ms. HARBOUR. In a way. That’s certainly something that is more 

in our footprint. 

Senator THUNE. Right. 
Ms. HARBOUR. And I will definitely look into that. 
Senator THUNE. OK. 
Mr.  PLUNKETT.  Senator,  could  I  throw  out  a  thought  on  your 
question?  I’m  Travis  Plunkett,  the  Legislative  Director  of  the  Con-
sumer  Federation  of  America.  And  I’ve  worked  with,  in  the  credit 
counseling  area  in  particular,  a  number  of  legitimate  operators  on 
the issue of voluntary standards. 

And one thing we encountered and one risk I see for the Federal 
Trade  Commission  there  is  the  question  of,  you  know  you  may  be 
a  good  actor  today.  You  change  your  business  practices  and  in  6 
months you’re not. So it’s the question of keeping up with and mon-
itoring the situation. 

I  mean  if  you’re  talking  about  individual  companies  as  opposed 
to  general  principles  you  offer  to  consumers,  you  know,  avoid  this

kind  of  company.  But  if  you’re  saying  here’s  the  list  of  good  guys 
and  if  you’re  not  on  the  list  you’re  a  bad  guy  then  boy,  what  an 
enforcement trick that is to try and keep up with month to month. 
Who’s on and who’s off and are they complying and did they comply 
6  months  ago,  but  they’re  not  now.  That  could  be  an  enforcement 
drain. 

Senator THUNE. Well I don’t disagree with that. I guess the only 
suggestion  I  would  make  is  that  there  are,  it  is  not  like  if  you’re 
on  the  list  you  fall  off  the  list  because  you’ve  fallen  into  the  bad 
actor  category  or  you’re  doing  something  that  is  fraudulent  out 
there.  To  me,  it  would  be  more  of  an  incentive  for  inducement  for 
companies if you had a set of these. 

These  are  recommendations  that  you  do  this,  this,  this  and  this. 
And obviously if it’s a fairly straightforward list of things that com-
panies  would  do  to  stay  on  that  list,  sure,  I  mean,  companies  that 
could fall off the list. I suspect it’s going to be somewhat self-polic-
ing. People are going to find that out fairly quickly. 

And  it  may  not  be  100  percent,  entirely  current,  100  percent  of 
the time. But I think it would at least present for a consumer some 
sort of indication of which companies out there are going about this 
in  the  right  way  and  following  these  practices  and  those  that 
aren’t. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Another  way  to  approach  that  Senator;  we  had 
asked  for  rules  to  implement  the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices 
Act. And if were allowed to implement rules in a sense that is best 
practices and if they fell short we could actually go after them. 

So  rules  in  this  area  might  achieve  the  objective  that  you’re 

speaking of. 

Senator THUNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Thune. I’m going to ask that 
some  graphs  be  passed  out  to  the  witnesses  and  also  to  the  two 
Senators if they wish to have this.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Commissioner,  you’ve  been  doing  most  of  the 
talking  this  morning.  And  that  has  been  a  little  bit  frustrating  to 
me  because  I  want  to  hear  from  Mrs.  Dix,  but  I  also  want  to  say, 
to  ask  Professor  Cox  and  Mr.  Plunkett,  who  haven’t  had  much 
chance to talk.

The figures we’re looking at here show the FTC total actions filed 
by  the  FTC  over  a  period  on  foreclosures  over  a  period  of  2  years, 
six.  Over  a  period  of  6  years,  14.  Over  a  period  of  10  years,  42.  I 
mean  it’s  just  the  credit  repair—well  you  can  see  the  thing  before 
you. 

You’re  saying  how  good  things  are  going  and  if  we  had  a  little 
bit more money and we had some more lawyers and this and that, 
we  could  have  a  bigger  footprint  and  do  more  things.  But  all  I’m 
looking  at,  unless  this  is  incorrect  which  I  want  you  to  tell  me. 
There  isn’t  much  happening.  There  is  not  much  happening.  There 
are very few people being helped because I assume that, you know, 
total actions filed by the FTC is a fairly heavy statement. Now I’m 
finished. 

Mr. Plunkett, I want to ask you too and Mr. Cox, if you feel that 
the  FTC  is  as  effective  as  they  purport  to  be  in  what  I’ve  listened 
to this morning or are they not? Be frank. 

Mr. PLUNKETT. Would you like me start, Senator? 
The CHAIRMAN. Sure. 
Mr.  PLUNKETT.  My  area  would  be  credit  counseling  and  debt 
management.  And  the  sort  of  model  case  is  the  one  you  cite  here, 
the  Ameridebt  case.  And  my  opinion  is  they’ve  been  effective  on 
credit counseling. The numbers don’t tell the whole game. 

The Ameridebt case was huge. They were the poster child for bad 
credit  counseling.  And  because  of  this  case  and  the  simultaneous 
enforcement efforts by the IRS to drive phony non-profits out of the 
business of credit counseling, the situation, as I testified to, is bet-
ter. It’s not perfect. There are still problems. Better on credit coun-
seling. 

On  debt  settlement  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  been 
playing  a  catch-up  game.  This  business  appears  to  have  exploded 
in  the  last  three,  4  years  because  there’s  such  incredible  demand 
by consumers for these services. They’re looking for something that 
helps  them  more  than  credit  counseling  because  credit  counseling 
can’t keep up, but is short of bankruptcy. And there really is noth-
ing  legitimate,  so  I’d  like  to  see  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  do 
more there. 

I know these cases are expensive. But I think there’s a lot to do. 
The  ultimate  problem  though  is  they’re  playing  a  catch-up  game 
and  we  need  to  get  out  front  with  strong  bright-line  laws  that 
make their enforcement job easier. 

They’re  not  just  looking  at  what’s  unfair  or  deceptive.  They  can 
go  in  and  say,  you  are  not  complying  with  the  law  because  you’re 
offering  a  service  and  charging  for  that  before  you  deliver  on  that 
service. And that’s where Congress can help. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Cox? 
Mr.  COX.  Thank  you.  One  of  the  nice  things  about  being  a  pro-

fessor is you can say exactly what you think. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  COX.  I  agree  with  everything  Mr.  Plunkett  said.  I’ll  tell  you 
from  having  worked  for  more  than  a  decade  with  the  FTC,  they 
were truly the shining light of Federal/state cooperation. You know, 
I  had  relationships  with  those  people.  You  could  call  them.  We’d 
work together. We’d say, you do this, I do that.

So  it  was  the  exact  opposite  of  trying  to  work  with  bank  regu-
latory agencies that were utterly hostile to consumer protection, in 
my  experience,  and  to  state  cooperation.  Having  said  that,  I  agree 
with Commissioner Harbour completely. The FTC needs better au-
thority.  They  need  to  be  able  to  move  swiftly  and  they  need  to  be 
able  to  pass  rules  without  cumbersome  Magnuson-Moss  restric-
tions. 

What I will also say is the FTC needs to differentiate more clear-
ly,  in  my  experience,  between  when  they  have  a  scam  which  is 
what  Ameridebt  was.  I  actually  started  that  case  and  passed  all 
our files over to the FTC many years ago in Minnesota along with 
another state. I believe it was Missouri. 

You know, the FTC just needs to move more quickly and act like 
a cop when they need to act like a cop. And for instance we’re talk-
ing about the education materials. Forget brochures. 

I mean, that’s really nice. That’s fine. But you have to think like 
the bad guy. You have to figure out how you’re going to get on TV 
and  say,  don’t  listen  to  the  rest  of  these  commercials  if  you  want 
to do effective education. 

So  I  just  think  you  got  to,  you  know,  you’ve  got  to  have  a  more 
aggressive  mind  set  when  it  comes  to  these  kinds  of  scams.  And 
then you have to be sophisticated and understand when you’re reg-
ulating  in  a  more  established  industry  where  the  businesses  are 
mostly  credible  you  have  to  have  a  different  touch.  And  you  have 
to think about where you are. 

But when it comes to the things on this chart, just get out there. 
And get out in front of it. I mean, we’re really, we’re 5 years ahead 
of the FTC on the foreclosure rescue issues. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Ok.  Thank  you.  With  Senator  Begich’s  permis-
sion,  Mrs.  Dix  could  you  just  kind  of  walk  us  through  what  you 
went through? 

Mrs.  DIX.  Yes.  I  have  a  statement  here.  As  you  know  my  name 
is  Nancy  Dix.  I’m  67  years  old.  I  live  in  a  double-wide  manufac-
tured home in Ansted, West Virginia. 

After my husband died of a heart attack in 2001 I was contacted 
by  a  lender  to  refinance  my  home  with  promises  of  saving  me 
money.  My  husband  had  always  handled  things  like  this  one.  So 
I didn’t know much about it. 

I  trusted  the  people  I  dealt  with  because  I  thought  they  were 
professional, looking out for my best interest. I later found out that 
I’d actually been taken advantage of. In the spring of 2002 I spoke 
to  a  mortgage  broker  called  Infinity  which  told  me  it  would  save 
me money. 

Infinity  sent  an  appraiser  out  to  my  house  and  valued  my  prop-
erty  at  $97,000.  I  later  learned  that  it  was  actually  only  worth 
$59,000. After the appraisal Infinity told me a man will be coming 
to my house to sign the papers. 

When  the  man  came  I  learned  the  first  time  that  my  payments 
would  be  $800  a  month.  This  is  higher  than  I  expected  and  a  lot 
for me to afford on a fixed income. I asked about the payments and 
was  told  that  in  a  few  months  they  could  lower  my  payment  to 
$600. 

The  signing  was  rushed  and  no  one  explained  anything  to  me. 

And I signed the papers. And I was confused.

The loan ended up at the bank called Flagstar. The total amount 
of the loan was $86,700 with an APR of 9.48. Under this loan I was 
required to make payments of over $245,000 over 30 years. 

After  signing  I  began  making  payments.  I  contacted  Flagstar 
after  a  few  months  to  lower  my  payments.  Flagstar  told  me  that 
I  would  have  to  come  up  with  $8,000  out  of  my  pocket  before  they 
could lower my payments. Money I did not have. 

I struggled to make payments over the years and was forced ulti-
mately  into  bankruptcy.  When  I  tried  to  catch  up  with  my  pay-
ments  with  Flagstar  they  wanted  me  to  pay  a  larger  amount  than 
I  could  afford  on  my  fixed  income.  Flagstar  wanted  me  to  pay 
$1,800 a month and my income was $2,000. 

Also,  Flagstar  forced/placed  expensive  insurance  on  my  account 
which  made  me  further  behind  my  monthly  payment.  On  July 
2005,  Flagstar  said  it  started  sending  my  payments  back  to  me. 
Eventually my home was sent to foreclosure with a sale for Decem-
ber 15, 2005. 

Around  this  time  I  was  contacted  by  an  outfit  from  Houston, 
Texas called Mortgage Rescue. They told me to send them some in-
formation  about  my  finances  and  $921.  They  would  stop  the  fore-
closure. 

So  on  November  8,  2005,  I  sent  them  the  information  and  the 
money. They responded to me by letter I received only days before 
the foreclosure. The letter said for me to call Flagstar and work out 
a  forbearance  agreement,  but  I  would  have  to  pay  the  entire 
amount  I  was  behind  and  a  $5,000  deposit  to  Flagstar  to  stop  the 
foreclosure. 

Mortgage  Rescue  knew  I  did  not  have  this  money.  I  could  have 
worked out a deal with Flagstar at any time without sending Mort-
gage Rescue $921. Basically they took my money for nothing. 

I later found out that Mortgage Rescue is not even licensed to do 
business  in  West  Virginia.  I  never  got  my  money  back.  Luckily  I 
was  able  to  call  the  West  Virginia  Attorney  General  who  had  the 
foreclosure  put  off.  I  was  sent  to  Mountain  State  Justice,  a  non- 
profit,  legal  service  office.  They  worked  it  out  so  I  could  keep  my 
home. 

If I had not called the attorney general or found Mountain State 
Justice  I  would  have  lost  my  home.  I  would  be  in  my  late  60s,  re-
tired,  widowed,  with  nowhere  to  live.  I  think  at  times  about  other 
people  who  have  given  their  hard-earned  money  to  scam  artists 
like Mortgage Rescue. 

I hope you are able to do something to prevent these crooks from 
taking  advantage  of  people  who  are  desperate  like  I  was  because 
they are facing loss of their homes. Thank you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Senator Begich, I thank you for your 
indulgence.  When  you  have  finished  your  line  of  questioning  I’m 
going  to  ask  Mr.  Plunkett  and  Mr.  Cox  and  Mr.  Himpler  to  com-
ment  on  what  Mrs.  Dix  said  because  I  think  it’s  profound.  I  think 
it’s all over this country. And I think it’s horrible. 

Senator  BEGICH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  didn’t  realize 

that she had not given her testimony. That was very——

Senator BEGICH. No problem, Mr. Chairman. I read it. I thought 
it was very interesting because I have heard of Infinity before and 
some other actions. 

But  let  me,  I  hate  to  keep  banging  on  this  issue.  And  I  under-
stand from the consumer folks that it might be difficult to manage 
and  so  forth.  Now  I  come  from  the  real  estate  industry.  We  know 
who the good characters are and the bad characters. 

When  I  was  Mayor  of  Anchorage  we  had  people  who  were  run-
ning  B  and  B  operations,  (bed  and  breakfasts)  and  we  sorted  out 
the  good  and  the  bad.  And  we  created  a  list.  It’s  not  complicated. 
And  the  consumer  needs  as  much  information  as  possible  to  know 
who’s right. 

So  let  me  reverse  it.  This  list  here  which,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  was 
going to ask a similar question. So thank you for this information. 
And  I  was  asking  your  staff.  I  had  them  screwing  around  and  I 
apologize. 

I  was  asking  another  question  was  out  of  all  these  people  who 
are  still—or  these  people  that  have  had  claims  or  actions  or  in 
process of having actions. I’m assuming some of these probably are 
still in business. And that’s my point. 

If  you’ve  already  started  issues  with  them,  consumers  should 
know that. Because it’s one more bit of information that they need 
to  know  who  is—because  how  do  you  get  information  of  all  these 
folks  that  you  have  litigation  on.  How  do  you  get  that  to  the  con-
sumer? 

Do  you  have  it  on  a  website  that’s  not  in  the  legalese?  I’m  not 
a lawyer. And you know, do you have a list that says these are the 
folks  that  we  have  pending  actions  against  at  this  time,  settled  or 
not. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  We  usually  have  press  releases  whenever  we  set-

tle matters. It’s up on our website. 

Senator  BEGICH.  I  understand.  Do  you  have  a  list  that  a  con-
sumer  could  go  to  your  website  and  say,  ah,  these  are  the  people 
at the FTC are busy—— 

Ms. HARBOUR. Yes, we do. We do have a list. 
Senator  BEGICH.  And  are  they  written  in  this  format,  ‘‘FTC 
versus blah, blah, blah’’ or is it listed as ‘‘these are companies we,’’ 
in  very,  simple,  my  language,  English,  not  lawyer  language,  that 
says—— 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Well,  I’ll  get  back  to  you  on  the  lawyer  language. 
But I know there are listed. I know it’s listed. But I will definitely 
get  back  to  you  whether  it’s  listed  in  lawyer-like  language  or 
whether it’s in plain English. 

Senator  BEGICH.  And  then  those  groups  that  you  associate  with 
and  I  forget  the  numbers,  thousands.  Do  you  send  them  the  list 
that  says  these  are  organizations  that  we  are  currently  inves-
tigating or have had settlements with? So those organizations who 
actually do the work with consumers, do they know this? 

Ms. HARBOUR. I will get back to you on that. I can’t answer that 

question right now. 

But if I could just address this paper which I suppose is pointing 
out  what  the  FTC  hasn’t  done  enough  of.  I  would  like  to  say  that 
we  do  have  in  the  foreclosure  rescue  area,  we  do  have  16  pending

investigations today. In the credit repair area, we have 13 matters 
today. In the debt counseling area, we have seven. 

We  get  it.  You  know,  we  shift  resources  when  the  need  occurs. 
The downturn happened September 2008. It was an acute economic 
downturn.  We  responded  immediately.  In  fact  we  had  been  re-
sponding anyway because we saw the trend. 

In  2007,  credit  issues  were  number  10  on  the  list  of  complaints 
in  Consumer  Sentinel.  In  2007,  number  10;  I’m  sure  most  of  these 
cases have been started before then. We are always the cop on the 
beat. We’re always pursuing these cases. 

Your  quibble  with  us  is  we  didn’t  do  enough  of  them.  We  have 
always  been  in  this  game.  Once  the  economic  downturn  occurred 
we  immediately  shifted  resources  and  the  numbers  that  you  don’t 
see are the numbers of what we are doing confidentially. 

I  even  had  some  push  back  to  even  mention  what  we’re  doing 
confidentially. But I knew Senator, Chairman, that it was very im-
portant  to  you  to  make  sure  that  we  are  being  responsive  to  the 
American  consumer.  So  yes,  there  are  16  investigations  right  now 
in  the  foreclosure  area.  There  are  13  in  the  credit  area.  There  are 
7  in  the  debt  counseling  and  there  are  10  in  the  Fair  Debt  Collec-
tion Practices Act. 

As  far  as  returning  value  to  the  American  consumer.  In  the 
CompuCredit  case  we  returned  $114  million.  This  was  settled  in 
September  2008.  Bear  Stearns,  $28  million.  So  this  piece  of  paper 
does not—— 

The CHAIRMAN. You’re using up all the Senator’s time. 
Ms. HARBOUR. Oh, I’m so sorry. 
The CHAIRMAN. I mean—— 
Senator BEGICH. Let me—I appreciate it. My point is at any level 
trying  to  inform  the  consumer  is  what  I—when  I  saw  the  hearing 
on  the  schedule,  to  me  is  very  important.  It’s  how  the  consumer, 
how  would  someone  like  Mrs.  Dix  know  what  to  do  and  not  to  do, 
and  not.  And  the  first  stage  is  who  is  a  good  character/bad  char-
acter. That’s my issue. 

And then my flip-back is over to the Association. And I know I’m 
out  of  time.  But  to  the  Association,  you  have  an  obligation  and  a 
responsibility. 

And  I  don’t  know  what  your  procedures  are.  So  if  you  could  get 

to me at some point. I know we’re going to run out of time. 

The CHAIRMAN. No, go ahead. 
Senator  BEGICH.  I  would  just  want  to  know  as  an  association, 
when  you  have  like  this,  you  know,  Mortgage  Rescue  which  may 
not  have  been  part  of  your  association.  But  if  you  have  ones  that 
have caused these issues what do you do to get them out? And get 
them out quick? And then how do you notify? 

Mr.  HIMPLER.  We  represent  the  lenders,  not  the  debt  collectors. 
Senator  BEGICH.  Well  your  assumption  is  all  lenders  are  good. 
I’m  asking  the  broader  question  here.  Today  we  have  major  prob-
lems. And I tell you in Alaska we just did a huge case against sev-
eral  lenders  for  fraud.  So  I’m  just  trying  to  let  me  broaden  it  then 
to lenders. 

As an association how do you clear the deck? 
Mr. HIMPLER. I think the basic point that both of you gentlemen 
have  made—the  Commissioner  has  tried  to  respond  to  in  terms  of

setting  a  minimum  standard  threshold  above  which  the  FTC  and 
other regulatory agencies can say, these are good actors. We, as an 
association have a best practices voluntary standard that all of our 
companies have to meet to be members in good standing. Those are 
posted on our website. 

Any  consumer,  any  Senator  or  any  regulatory  body  can  take  a 
look  at  those.  And  that  is  how  we  ensure  that  our  lenders  are 
above reproach. 

Senator BEGICH. I will stop, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  What  do  you  do  when  somebody  goes  from  non- 
profit  to  profit?  Do  you  measure  that?  Do  you  say,  you  can’t  do 
that? 

Mr. HIMPLER. I’m not sure I follow you, Senator. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well  the  eight-year  rule  I  was  talking  about  in 

the beginning in my first question to you. 

Mr. HIMPLER. I apologize. I’m not following you, Senator. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Alright.  Let  me  get  back  to  what  I  said  I  was 
going to do. And that is call on Mr. Plunkett and Mr. Cox and you 
to comment on Mrs. Dix’s situation. How did that come to be? How 
could that have been stopped? 

We’ll start with you, sir. 
Mr. PLUNKETT. Senator, we should, the entire consumer commu-
nity  and  this  includes  the  enforcement  community,  need  to  do  a 
better  job  of  educating  consumers.  But  I’m  appalled  at  what  I 
heard from Mrs. Dix. I heard a lot about these scams. 

And  it’s  a  losing  battle  unless  we  can  get  out  front  with  strong 
laws  that  and  good  enforcement  resources  that  agencies  like  the 
FTC can use to stop these scams before they start. Otherwise we’re 
just playing catch-up. We’re scrambling to inform consumers about 
businesses that they should never have had to deal with. 

The CHAIRMAN. Please? 
Mr.  COX.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  agree  with  Mr.  Plunkett. 
You  need  bright  lines  because  that  allows  for  clear,  efficient  law 
enforcement. You have to bring everything as a UDAP case, it just 
takes  way  too  long.  And  you  need  to  get  way  out  in  front  and  en-
force them. 

And  again,  when  you’re  dealing  with  scams,  I  think  you  need  to 
arrest  people  and  put  them  in  jail.  You  just  have  to  have  a  more 
aggressive  mentality.  Now  that’s  not  the  FTC’s  job.  But  we  need 
to,  you  know,  we  need  to  develop  a  comprehensive  enforcement 
strategy where we take the worst of the worst, we put them in jail. 
We put them on TV. And we parade them. 

In  2004–2005,  I  was  screaming  we  should  be  doing  that  with 
subprime  mortgage  lending  companies.  And  I  think  I  was  right 
about  that.  I  mean,  we  just  have  to  put  the  fear  of  God  in  people 
when  they  are  doing  that  kind  of  level  of  bad  practice.  Mrs.  Dix 
never should have been subjected to that. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Before  I  call  on  you,  Mr.  Himpler.  I  so  relate  to 
what  you’re  saying,  Mr.  Cox.  I  think  this  is  an  ‘‘under  the  radar’’ 
world or an underworld, if you want to call it. Nobody knows about 
it except the victims who get clobbered by it. 

In  spite  of  all  the  words  from  the  Commissioner  and  you’re  a 
very  good  Commissioner.  I  fully  recognize  that.  I  am  just  appalled 
by these figures. I mean, I’m just appalled by them.

This  is  over  a  ten-year  period,  six-year  period,  two-year  period. 
And  you’ve  got—what  do  you  have?  How  many  do  you  have?  Do 
you have 1,400 people working for you or is it 100? 

Ms. HARBOUR. 270 consumer protection attorneys. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I’m  not  talking  about  attorneys.  I’m  talking 

about people. 

Ms. HARBOUR. Oh, people, 1,094. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  OK.  So  that’s  a  lot  of  people.  And  we  could  give 

you more people. I don’t know whether it would do any good. 

I  just,  I  so  relate  to  what  you’re  saying.  It’s  like  anything  which 
is out of sight, but tremendously damaging to people. If you do not 
hold people accountable. If you do not send people to jail. If you do 
not hold somebody up for ridicule. 

I won’t get into some things I’d like to, but I think that’s the only 
way  it  works.  That’s  the  only  way  it  works  because  then  the  word 
begins  to  get  around  in  that  underworld  that  if  you  do  this,  you 
will  go  to  jail.  Because  there  is  a  combination  of  states  who  are 
doing a very good job working with the FTC which says it can’t do 
that. States can. 

You  know,  attorney  generals  can.  I  think  that’s  got  to  happen. 
It  has  got  to  happen  in  order  for  people  like  Mrs.  Dix  not  to  have 
to go through what she went through. 

It won’t stop it because it’s unfortunately the nature. It’s human 
nature that when the crisis gets worse, more people are in trouble. 
More bad actors jump in to take advantage of them. 

I  mean  America  has  that  side  of  it  which  nobody.  That’s  why 
we’re  having  this  hearing.  We’ve  never  had  a  hearing  like  this  be-
fore.  It  makes  me  very  angry.  It  makes  me  very  upset  that  Mrs. 
Dix had to go through this. 

She  wasn’t  particularly  thrilled  about  coming  up  here  to  testify. 
In  fact  that  was  about  the  last  thing  in  the  world  she  wanted  to 
do.  And  then  Mr.  Plunkett  who  has  this  enormous  Consumer  Fed-
eration  of  America  says  he  shocked  by  what  he  hears.  So  we  have 
to do something about that. 

Mr. Himpler, what is your reaction to Mrs. Dix’s situation? 
Mr.  HIMPLER.  I  am  equally  appalled.  And  Mrs.  Dix,  I’m  truly 
sorry you faced this. I share the sentiments expressed by all of the 
witnesses. 

But  I  will  return  to  something  that  I  think,  Mr.  Cox  said.  As 
much  as  we  want  to  utilize  written  materials  to  get  information 
into  the  hands  of  consumers  and  again,  I  commend  the  FTC  for 
their  fine  work  in  this  area,  we  are  at  a  very  critical  stage  with 
the current situation in our economy. 

We need to get information to consumers on the airwaves, on the 
radio, on the TV. That has just got to happen because they’re being 
inundated. And I’m sure going home at night listening to the radio, 
Senator,  you  probably  here  four  or  five  every  time  you  commute. 
I know I do. And they’re very attractive ads. 

But we need to pull out all the stops in this area. And if I could 
beg  your  pardon  for  just  one  moment,  not  necessarily  right  in  the 
jurisdiction  of  this  committee.  But  one  of  the  things  we’re  working 
on  with  the  depository  regulators  that  Mr.  Cox  mentioned,  there’s 
an effort to do loan modification with respect to mortgages.

We’ve also got a crisis, if you will, in the auto sector. And a num-
ber  of  our  members  that  provide  auto  financing  through  lines  of 
credit  through  banks  are  having  trouble  keeping  those  lines  open, 
particularly  when  they  try  and  do  the  same  sort  of  work-outs  that 
are being encouraged on the mortgage side. 

I guess my last comment would be as we are trying to encourage 
lenders  to  do  work-outs  with  consumers  like  Mrs.  Dix,  we  need  to 
make  absolutely  clear  that  working  with  your  lender  is  absolutely 
important in terms of any sort of loan modification, rate reduction, 
payment  reduction  and  the  like.  Because  while  folks  read  about  it 
in  the  paper  all  of  the  fine  work  the  Administration  and  Congress 
are  doing  to  encourage  lenders  to  do  work-outs.  It  gets  very  con-
fusing  if  they  see  ads  late  at  night  for  people  encouraging  them  to 
follow up on those initiatives and they’re not the same people. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I’m  not  sure  Congress  is  doing  any  particular 

fine work on that. But it’s nice of you to say that. 

Mr. HIMPLER. I want to be invited back. 
[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. We have a lot of work to do here. Let me ask the 
Commissioner  this.  Why  can’t  we  find  a  means  to  send  the  most 
vulnerable  consumers,  like  consumers  who  have  missed,  let’s  say, 
one or two or maybe even three mortgage payments some informa-
tion  about  the  kinds  of  fraudsters  who  may  be  trying  to  seek  and 
take  advantage  of  them  before  they  come  under  the  spell  of  those 
fraudsters? There’s got to be some mechanism to do that. 

Do you keep track of people who are getting in this kind of trou-

ble? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  There  are  millions  of  consumers  now  that  are 
probably  facing  foreclosure.  I  am  trying  to  think  of  some  way  we 
could warn them other than what we are doing. Perhaps television 
advertising, I don’t think we’ve ever done that. Maybe that is some-
thing we can look into. 

The CHAIRMAN. You probably can’t afford that. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  Exactly.  Let  us  give  some  careful  thought  to  this 

and we will get back to you. 

The CHAIRMAN. Please, please, please. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  We  know  how  important  this  is  to  the  American 

consumer and to this committee. 

Mr. HIMPLER. Senator, to that point starting last fall the lending 
community  worked  with  the  Administration  and  formed  a  group 
called Hope Now that—— 

The CHAIRMAN. The former Administration? 
Mr.  HIMPLER.  The  former  Administration.  And  one  of  the  prin-
ciples  was  identifying  at-risk  borrowers  who  were  either  on  the 
verge  of  missing  a  payment  or  had  missed  a  payment  or  two  to 
take aggressive action in terms of the lenders reaching out to those 
borrowers  to  work  with  them  to  bring  them  current  and  work  out 
the situation directly. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  you  know,  I  don’t  know  what  it’s  going  to 
take.  But  we’re,  on  this  committee,  we’re  going  to  work.  And  no-
body is sacred except you, Mrs. Dix. 

[Laughter.] 
Mrs. DIX. Thank you.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Nobody  is  sacred.  We’re  not  doing  our  jobs.  You 
say  Congress  is  doing  its  job.  The  Congress  is  not  doing  its  job. 
This committee is not doing its job to be helpful. 

This is a massive problem where people kind of disappear under 
the  water  silently.  I  remember  watching  my  son  when  he  was  2 
years or a year and a half old, a year old or half a year old, sitting 
in  a  swimming  pool,  top  of  the  steps,  so  it  was  up  to  about  his 
throat.  And  my  wife  and  I  were  sitting  on  opposite  sides  of  the 
swimming pool reportedly each of us keeping an eye on him. 

But  for  a  moment  we  didn’t.  And  then  he  suddenly  just  sort  of 
floated down underwater. And fortunately I saw him and I went in 
and I got him and he was OK. But it was one of the scariest things 
I’ve  ever  been  through  in  my  life  because  you  tend  to  love  your 
children.  And  I  have  a  feeling  this  is  what  Mrs.  Dix  brings  to  this 
hearing. 

Didn’t  particularly  want  to  come.  Is  probably  angry  as  the  dick-
ens and doesn’t know where to turn, happened to get bailed out by 
an attorney general. That might have been lucky. 

How  you  two  got  together  I  don’t  know.  But  that  was  lucky.  I’m 
really  happy  about  that.  But  that  is  not  happening  to  millions  of 
people out there. 

And in the meantime I’m still holding this up. And I’m absolutely 
shocked.  And  I  appreciate  the  effort,  but  that  doesn’t  count  any-
more. 

It’s  like  the  Stimulus  package  or  the  Banking  package  or  the 
Health Care Reform or energy. You’ve got to do it right. It has got 
to work or else it doesn’t mean anything. 

People  will  just  keep  slipping  underwater  and  nobody  will  know 
about  it  because  newspapers  won’t  write  about  it  and  the  press 
won’t  cover  it  because  it’s  not  a  murder.  It  is  a  murder.  It’s  just 
a murder without blood. 

I  don’t  know.  So  we’re  going  to  keep  working  on  this  thing.  I 

want you to know that. We will be aggressive. 

I  thank  all  of  you  for  coming  here  today.  I  think  it’s,  frankly  I 
think  it’s  great  that  the  Commerce  Committee  has  this  kind  of 
committee.  Commerce—everybody  says  well,  that  must  be  you  do 
the  economy  of  the  United  States.  Well,  we  do  hundreds  of  huge 
things  from  oceans  to  skies  to  aviation,  transportation,  railroads, 
all  kinds  of  things.  But  we’ve  got  to  focus  on  this  too  and  maybe 
this foremost. 

So  for  the  information  of  all  Senators  who  were  not  here,  but 
their  staff  might  be.  We’ll  leave  the  record  open  until  the  close  of 
business  on  Friday,  March  6,  2009,  for  any  questions  or  state-
ments. 

In  the  meantime  we’re  going  to  try  and  figure  out  how  we  can 
put  a  fire  under  the  FTC  and  under  the  American  people  and 
maybe  get  some  public  service  TV  going.  Everybody’s  going  broke. 
Radios  are  going  broke.  TV  is  going  broke.  Everybody  is  going 
broke. It’s a great world and that doesn’t matter. 

We  have  an  obligation  to  the  Mrs.  Dixes,  we  flat  out  do.  And 
we’re not fulfilling it. We’re not even noticing it. We’re not even no-
ticing it.

And I’m interested in these states. Maybe more of this should go 
to  the  states.  The  problem  is  a  lot  of  states  wouldn’t  care.  They 
wouldn’t do a thing. 

Minnesota  would.  A  lot  of  other  states  wouldn’t.  So  anyway,  on 

that tender note, this hearing is adjourned.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 
Thank you, Chairman Rockefeller, for holding this morning’s hearing. The effects 
of  the  troubled  economy  are  being  felt  nationwide  with  rising  unemployment  rates, 
a  distressed  housing  market,  and  depleted  retirement  savings.  We  are  witnessing 
a visible increase in the number of consumers who have mounting unpaid bills and 
they are losing their homes. This is alarming in and of itself, but more disconcerting 
is  the  fact  that  some  individuals  may  use  this  opportunity  for  their  own  gain  and 
prey on those in trouble. 

Financial distress—especially the worry of losing a house—can lead to desperation 
and  it  is  imperative  that  disreputable  companies  not  be  allowed  to  profit  from  the 
misfortune  of  others.  There  are  a  number  of  Federal  laws  aimed  at  protecting  the 
public  from  dishonest  conduct  in  the  financial  services  industry  and  the  FTC  is 
tasked  with  the  responsibility  of  stopping  such  practices  when  the  need  arises.  Be-
sides  shutting  down  bad  actors,  it  is  essential  that  consumers  be  knowledgeable 
from the start so they can make responsible, educated financial decisions, and know 
what  their  options  are  if  they  ever  find  themselves  in  trouble.  They  should  know 
how to reach trustworthy help and be aware of the warning signs of any fraudulent 
companies that may promise to help them. 

I  want  to  thank  all  of  the  witnesses  for  agreeing  to  be  here  today  and  I  look  for-

ward to a constructive conversation. 

MICHAEL C. DILLON, 
Manchester, NH. 
Hon. JAY ROCKEFELLER,

RE: ‘‘CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE CREDIT CRISIS’’ FEBRUARY 26, 2009 

Dear Mr. Chairman, 

Admittedly, I am at somewhat of an advantage in that I have been able to study 
previous testimony and address it at my leisure but I feel that I need to rebut some 
of the Commissioner Harbour’s testimony given during this hearing. 

I am nothing more than a consumer living in New Hampshire. However, I am one 
of  the  281,1000  Federal  Trade  Commission-certified  victims  of  mortgage  servicer 
Fairbanks  Capital  Corp.  n/k/a  Select  Portfolio  Servicing  Inc.  as  certified  for  USA  v. 
Fairbanks  in  2003/2004.  My  personal  experience  with  and  observance  of  Federal 
Trade  Commission  actions  differs  from  the  portrait  that  Commissioner  Harbour 
painted for you during her testimony. 

It  is  my  personal  experience,  and  that  of  many,  many  other  Fairbanks/SPS  vic-
tims, that the Federal Trade Commission did little to originally protect homeowners 
victimized  by  Fairbanks/SPS  or  to  enforce  the  terms  of  the  settlement  of  USA  v. 
Fairbanks.  While  the  class  action  was  settled  back  in  2004,  I  hear  from  Fairbanks/ 
SPS victims attempting to save their homes from illegal foreclosures via my website, 
GetDShirtz.com,  literally  to  this  day.  Some  of  these  victims  have  been  dealing  with 
Fairbanks/SPS’  illegal  and  fraudulent  servicing  actions  for  ten  or  more  years.  One 
disturbing complaint that I hear more often than I care to is that Fairbanks victims 
never received notification of the class action and therefore were unable to preserve 
their legal rights by opting out of it. 

Despite  the  fact  that  this  has  been  brought  to  the  Federal  Trade  Commission’s 
attention on more than one occasion, the FTC has taken no apparent action. In fact, 
the Federal Trade Commission has received more than 500 pages of complaints from 
consumers/Fairbanks  victims  post  USA  v.  Fairbanks  settlement  and,  to  the  best  of 
my knowledge, has only taken action to modify the original settlement to the benefit 

(77)

78 

of  Fairbanks/SPS  in  September  2007.  To  this  day,  no  action  has  been  taken  by  the 
Federal  Trade  Commission  to  enforce  the  original  settlement  terms  or  protect  con-
sumers/homeowners harmed by Fairbanks/SPS’ actions. 

The Federal Trade Commission has, in its possession, approximately 60–100 boxes 
of information and/or evidence that it has collected through its investigation of Fair-
banks/SPS.  Yet,  when  asked,  it  is  the  Commission’s  position  to  deny  the  very  vic-
tims  it  portends  to  protect  and  the  public  in  general  access  to  the  vast  majority  of 
this  information  despite  the  fact  that  this  information  may  very  well  assist  home-
owners/victims to prove their own cases of illegal foreclosure brought by Fairbanks/ 
SPS  against  them.  Through  a  Freedom  Of  Information  Act  request  I  have  been 
granted access to a supposed total of six of those boxes of information. Much of what 
I have been given is simply consumer complaints. The remainder of the information 
is  largely  media  coverage  of  the  investigation  and  several  private  actions  filed  by 
consumers that have been redacted to ‘‘protect’’ victims’ identities. How the Federal 
Trade Commission can legally redact publicly filed court actions I am not sure. But 
the  bottom  line  is  that  it  has  been  my  personal  experience  that  the  Federal  Trade 
Commission is, in fact, not doing everything it can to protect consumers or help con-
sumers protect themselves. 

Commissioner  Harbour  stated  that  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  needed  addi-
tional authority to bring actions against corporations for violations of The FTC Act, 
FDCPA,  TILA,  and  the  CRO  Act.  The  fact  is  that  the  Commission  already  has  this 
authority  and  has  used  it  many  times  in  the  past  against  those  corporations  that 
choose to violate the acts. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the Commission does 
not  seem  to  want  to  enforce  these  laws  and  regulations  to  their  fullest  capacity.  In 
2008 the Commission waived all but $8,000.00 of a $1.2 million civil penalty levied 
against  a  mortgage  XXX  because  of  ‘‘the  defendants  inability  to  pay’’  the  fine.  This 
is  an  extremely  disturbing  trend  that  can  be  tracked  via  the  Commission’s  own 
website  at  www.ftc.gov.  A  search  of  the  phrase  ‘‘defendants  inability  to  pay’’  at  the 
FTC  site  reveals  approximately  280  instances  where  defendants  have  been  given 
waivers  of  civil  financial  penalties  because  of  the  defendants  inability  to  pay  them. 
How could civil action from the Federal Trade Commission serve as any kind of de-
terrent  of  ‘‘bad  acts’’  if  corporations  can  expect  to  have  the  financial  penalties 
waived by the Commission? 

Commissioner  Harbour  cites  FTC  v.  EMC/Bear  Stearns  as  one  of  the  Commis-
sion’s  ‘‘success  stories’’  in  informing  consumers/victims  of  the  Commissions  actions. 
Based  on  my  own  limited  knowledge  of  the  case,  combined  with  conversations  that 
I  have  had  and  comments  that  I  have  read  by  EMC  victims,  FTC  v.  EMC/Bear 
Stearns  should  be  considered  an  embarrassment  to  the  Commission  as  opposed  to 
anything  even  remotely  resembling  victory  or  evidence  of  the  Commission’s  efficacy 
in protecting consumers. I say this because FTC v. EMC/Bear took place more than 
4  years  after  the  settlement  of  USA  v.  Fairbanks.  If  USA  v.  Fairbanks  had  been 
any  kind  of  deterrent  to  the  mortgage  servicing  industry,  the  Commission  never 
should have had to bring charges against EMC/Bear Stearns to begin with. The fact 
of  the  matter  is  that  USA  v.  Fairbanks  was  viewed  by  the  servicing  industry  as 
nothing  more  than  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  the  United  States.  The  lack  of  en-
forcement  of  the  Fairbanks/SPS  settlement  did  absolutely  nothing  to  deter  other 
servicers  from  committing  virtually  identical  illegal  practices  in  their  own  business 
models. 

The Commission brought virtually identical charges in FTC v. EMC/Bear to those 
brought  against  Fairbanks/SPS.  There  may  actually  have  been  more  charges 
brought  in  FTC  v.  EMC/Bear  than  were  brought  in  USA  v.  Fairbanks.  But,  for 
some  reason,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  chose  to  settle  EMC/Bear  for  nearly 
half of the $40 million settlement obtained in USA v. Fairbanks. Additionally, EMC/ 
Bear was settled before the actual number of victims involved in the case was even 
determined.  The  day  after  the  EMC/Bear  settlement  was  announced,  I  received  a 
return telephone call from FTC Attorney Lucy Morris’ office as I had inquired about 
the  number  of  victims  involved  in  EMC/Bear.  I  was  told  that  that  number  had  not 
been  determined  as  of  that  time  but  the  FTC  was  expecting  ‘‘tens  of  thousands’’  of 
victims  to  be  included  in  the  action.  How  could  the  Commission  accurately  deter-
mine  the  amount  of  restitution  and/or  redress  that  needed  to  be  extracted  from 
EMC/Bear  if  the  Commission  had  no  idea  how  many  victims  were  actually  affected 
by EMC/Bears’ illegal actions? 

Commissioner  Harbour  cited  the  fact  that  the  fact  that  the  Commission  used  the 
redress checks from FTC v. EMC/Bear as a measure of ‘‘reaching out’’ to the 86,000 
consumers eventually determined to be victims of EMC/Bear Stearns. There are sev-
eral  serious  problems  in  utilizing  this  method  of  informing  consumers/victims.  I 
have personally heard from at least one EMC victim that, to this day, has not been 
notified of the action or received any kind of restitution. This despite EMC’s attempt

79 

to literally rewrite her chain of title at her county registry of deeds. This victim has 
provided  evidence  of  this  action  taken  by  EMC  to  me  so  I  do  not  state  this  in  any 
kind  of  uninformed  or  speculative  manner.  If  the  Commission  failed  to  inform  one 
victim, how many others did the Commission miss? 

Secondly, the 280,000 victims certified in USA v. Fairbanks were required to give 
up  any  legal  rights  to  pursuer  Fairbanks/SPS  in  any  further  legal  action  in  order 
to  obtain  their  redress/restitution.  In  providing  restitution/redress  checks  to  the 
86,000  consumers  that  the  Commission  deemed  to  be  victims  of  EMC/Bear  were 
these  victims  required  to  do  so  as  well?  Was  this  properly  explained  to  the  86,000 
victims  before  they  cashed  their  redress/restitution  checks?  Did  the  86,000  victims 
fully  understand  the  legal  ramifications  of  accepting  the  redress/restitution  checks? 
Did they, in fact, give up any legal rights in accepting those checks? 

Most  importantly,  we  are  only  now  finding  out  the  necessity  to  have  servicers, 
note holders, trustees and others involved in bringing both judicial and non-judicial 
foreclosure  actions  prove  that  they  have  legal  standing  to  bring  those  actions.  It  is 
becoming increasingly apparent that more and more original notes have been ‘‘lost’’ 
or  are  otherwise  unable  to  be  produced  by  the  supposed  owners  and/or  foreclosing 
entities. Such being the case, did the Commission due proper diligence in confirming 
that  EMC/Bear  had  the  proper  legal  standing  to  be  servicing  each  of  the  86,000 
loans involved in FTC v. EMC/Bear Stearns or did the Commission simply assume 
that EMC/Bear had proper legal standing at the time of settlement? 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  all  for  laws  and  regulations  that  protect  consumers  in  any 
manner, shape and/or form. In my own humble opinion, there are already sufficient 
laws and regulations to protect consumers from the ‘‘bad actors’’ that Commissioner 
Harbour and the Federal Trade Commission supposedly prosecute. The problem lays 
in  the  enforcement  —or  more  precisely  the  lack  thereof—of  these  laws  and  regula-
tions. To the best of my knowledge, the Federal Trade Commission is a civil enforce-
ment entity. Herein lies the problem. Any ‘‘civil’’ penalty brought by the Commission 
has  the  potential  to  be  waived  if  a  corporation  is  determined  ‘‘unable  to  pay’’  the 
penalty or any portion thereof. Even if a corporation is held to the full civil penalty 
imposed by the Commission, in many cases the penalty is so insignificant compared 
to the corporation’s income that it is viewed as nothing more than the cost of doing 
business  in  the  United  States.  In  the  years  leading  up  to  the  Commission’s  inves-
tigation  of  Fairbanks,  Fairbanks  was  reportedly  making  upwards  of  $100  million 
per month. A review of their financial records or The PMI Group’s SEC filings may 
be  able  to  confirm  this.  Fairbanks/SPS  ‘‘voluntarily’’  settled  USA  v.  Fairbanks  for 
between $40 and $55 million. Of that amount, Fairbanks’ majority shareholder, The 
PMI  Group,  guaranteed  $35  million.  The  minority  shareholder,  Financial  Security 
Assurance,  provided  an  additional  $10  million.  Testimony  was  provided  in  USA  v. 
Fairbanks stating that Fairbanks/SPS was in such poor financial condition that de-
fense counsel, plaintiff counsel and the Commission expressed concern as to whether 
Fairbanks would survive beyond the class action. Yet, 6 months after the settlement 
was approved, Fairbanks/SPS was purchased by Credit Suisse and immediately ob-
tained  $6  Billion  in  servicing  business.  If  a  corporation  cannot  provide  proper  res-
titution as a result of a Federal Trade Commission investigation, settlement or ver-
dict,  why  is  that  corporation  given  the  opportunity  to  continue  to  do  business  via 
reduced fines or ‘‘waivers’’ of monetary penalties as opposed to being dissolved? De-
spite  the  Commission  having  the  ability  to  seek  additional  restitution  from  defend-
ants  if/when  their  financial  situations  improve,  the  Commission  does  not  always 
seek to do so, as in the case of USA v. Fairbanks/SPS. 

As  long  as  corporations  have  no  fear  of  any  criminal  prosecution  by  the  Federal 
Trade  Commission  or  other  enforcement  body,  these  ‘‘penalties’’  levied  by  the  Com-
mission  will  be  viewed  as  nothing  more  than  the  cost  of  doing  business.  It  is  also 
my  opinion  that,  as  long  as  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  is  allowed  to  function 
in  the  manner  in  which  it  has  for  at  least  the  last  10  years,  consumers  have  no 
hope  of  being  properly  protected  or  compensated  for  the  illegal  acts  perpetrated 
against them by corporate greed. 

I  would  be  more  than  happy  to  attempt  to  answer  any  questions  that  the  Com-

mittee may have at any time. 

Sincerely, 

MICHAEL C. DILLON

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 
Washington, DC, March 23, 2009 

Hon. JAY ROCKEFELLER, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Rockefeller, 

I am writing to follow-up on questions that were raised during the Federal Trade 
Commission’s February 26, 2009 testimony regarding the credit crisis and consumer 
protection  and  questions  for  the  record  that  were  provided  by  Senator  Warner  and 
Senator Boxer. I welcome this opportunity to provide the information requested and 
also  to  provide  some  additional  information  about  the  FTC’s  consumer  protection 
mission. 
I. The Bureau of Consumer Protection 

As you know, the Commission has two law enforcement missions: competition and 
consumer  protection.  On  the  consumer  protection  side,  the  FTC  has  270  attorneys 
who are responsible for enforcing more than forty Federal consumer protection laws 
and regulations. In Fiscal Year 2008, the Commission filed 68 new consumer protec-
tion  law  enforcement  actions  in  Federal  district  court,  on  issues  ranging  from  the 
financial matters we discussed at the hearing, to telemarketing fraud and false ad-
vertising, data security and violations of the National Do Not Call registry. In 2008, 
Commission staff obtained orders providing monetary redress for consumers totaling 
$215  million,  and  obtained  orders  requiring  an  additional  $14  million  in  payments 
to  the  U.S.  Treasury  for  civil  penalties  and  the  disgorgement  of  ill-gotten  gains.  In 
2008, the Commission’s law enforcement actions stopped ongoing illegal conduct vic-
timizing  millions  of  consumers.  In  addition  to  litigating  cases,  attorneys  in  the  Bu-
reau  of  Consumer  Protection  are  conducting  numerous  ongoing  rulemakings,  inves-
tigating and preparing significant reports, such as the 2008 study on food marketing 
to  children  and  adolescents  and  reports  on  behavioral  advertising  and  debt  collec-
tion, providing guidance to industry to help them comply with the rules we enforce, 
engaging  in  outreach  to  stakeholders  through  workshops  and  seminars,  and  pro-
viding support to other law enforcement agencies, including criminal authorities. 

Unlike  other  agencies  that  do  not  litigate  their  own  cases,  FTC  staff  are  respon-
sible for investigating and litigating almost all o f the consumer protection cases we 
bring.  Investigating  fraud  cases  can  be  quite  challenging  and  resource-intensive, 
and  FTC  staff  have  developed  the  skills  needed  to  track  down  recalcitrant  defend-
ants,  unravel  complex  corporate  webs,  locate  bank  assets  and  other  hidden  funds, 
find  witnesses,  and  develop  a  sufficient  evidentiary  record  to  allow  us  to  convince 
a  Federal  court  to  issue  injunctions  to  stop  the  fraud  and  ultimately  redress  con-
sumers. 

The consumer protection cases brought by the FTC often proceed to litigation, and 
substantial staff resources are dedicated to litigating these cases that do not settle. 
Indeed, at the moment, the Bureau of Consumer Protection is actively litigating ap-
proximately 55 cases. Many of these cases are complex litigations with sophisticated 
opposing counsel and require the agency to devote substantial resources to extensive 
discovery,  motions  practice  and  ultimately  trials.  To  best  leverage  its  limited  re-
sources, Commission staff work closely with other state, local, and international law 
enforcement  agencies  and  we  occasionally  coordinate  law  enforcement  sweeps  with 
these  other  agencies.  Additionally,  Commission  staff  frequently  work  with  criminal 
law  enforcement  agencies  to  encourage  the  criminal  prosecution  of  crimes  arising 
from acts investigated by the Commission. 
II. Follow-up Requested at the Hearing 
A.  Is  it  advisable  for  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  to  compile  a  list  of  bad  actors 

so consumers know which companies to avoid? 

It  would  be  extremely  difficult  to  compile  and  maintain  an  accurate  and  reliable 
nationwide  list  of  bad  actors.  In  the  first  instance,  it  would  be  difficult  to  create 
such  a  list,  given  the  scope  of  the  marketplace  and  the  types  of  businesses  under 
the  FTC’s  jurisdiction.  Any  such  list  also  would  be  out  of  date  quite  soon  because 
bad actors committing fraud change their names and lines of business very quickly. 
In addition, there are legitimate companies that the FTC has charged with violating 
the  law,  and  in  some  instances  in  very  serious  ways,  but  nevertheless  they  later 
change their business practices and comply with the law. Such a company could re-
main mistakenly on a ‘‘bad actors’’ list even after it has come into compliance. 

The  FTC  does  inform  the  public  of  companies  and  individuals  who  have  been 
named  as  defendants  in  Commission  law  enforcement  actions.  The  agency  specifi-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

81 

cally publicizes and makes available on its website the names of companies and in-
dividuals that the Commission has named in its lawsuits. However, the agency only 
does so after it has developed evidence sufficient to provide at least reason to believe 
that they have violated the law. Consumers may consider this information in decid-
ing whether to do business with a company or an individual. 

Overall,  however,  the  best  strategy  to  warn  consumers  about  bad  actors  is 
through  consumer  education  about  bad  business  practices.  That  is  why  the  FTC’s 
multi-media  consumer  education  campaigns  give  consumers  the  tools  and  informa-
tion  they  need  so  that  they  can  independently  assess  each  company’s  marketing 
practices, spot red flags, and stop before paying a had actor for any promised service 
that may not be provided. 
B. Why doesn’t the FTC engage in television public service advertising? 

Commission staff have not found the production of video public service announce-
ments (PSAs) for network or cable TV to be a cost-effective use of our limited budg-
et. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, released in January 2008 (see http:// 
www.kff.  org/entmedia/entmedia012408nr.cfm),  found  that  TV  stations  donate  an 
average of 17 seconds per hour to public service advertising, and only 9 seconds per 
hour in prime time. 

Much  of  that  PSA  time  is  given  to  messages  produced  by  the  networks  them-
selves, on issues they choose. An example of this is the ‘‘The More You Know’’ cam-
paign  by  NBC  Universal.  Nevertheless,  many  large-scale  public  education  cam-
paigns  still  include  a  TV  PSA  component,  so  there  is  intense  competition  to  get 
PSAs on the air, even though available time slots are not ideal and are ad hoc. 

The  Commission  has  had  success  with  other  types  of  public  service  announce-
ments.  We  have  created  PSAs  to  run  in  the  classified  advertising  sections  of  news-
papers  and  other  print  publications,  and  we  have  created  PSAs  for  magazines  on 
request. We also have produced PSAs for radio—both announcer copy and produced 
spots. We have anecdotal evidence that announcers read our public service copy and 
get  it  into  their  rotations—and  that  they  download  our  produced  spots  from  our 
website  and  use  those  as  well.  These  radio  spots  often  have  led  to  news  interviews 
with  FTC  staff  attorneys.  We  have  created  videos  for  distribution  on  the  web  that 
local  cable  access  shows  have  aired.  Cable  access  stations  are  much  more  generous 
than  networks  at  placing  PSAs,  but  their  viewership  is  relatively  low.  Some  of  the 
FTC’s videos can be seen at www.YouTube.com/FTCVideos. 

Video is, nonetheless, a critical component of most successful outreach efforts, and 
I  believe  that  producing  informational  videos,  posting  them  to  the  web,  and  releas-
ing them to the press and to interested partner organizations is one of the most effi-
cient  and  cost-effective  ways  for  us  to  reach  a  wide  audience.  Our  recent  videos  il-
lustrate the power and reach of our efforts in this area: we released two videos tell-
ing  people  that  AnnualCreditReport.com  is  the  one  authorized  source  for  the  free 
credit  reports  that  the  law  entitles  consumers.  One  week  following  the  release  of 
the  videos,  we  have  reports  indicating  they  were  the  subject  of  almost  100  influen-
tial  blogs  as  well  as  news  stories  in  37  markets.  Many  of  the  stories  and  posts  in-
cluded  embedded  videos,  and  all  included  a  link  to  either  www.FTC.gov/freereports 
or  www.YouTube.com/FTCVideos.  At  this  writing,  the  videos  have  logged  some 
40,000 views on the FTC’s YouTube channel. 
C. How does the FTC measure the effectiveness of its consumer education campaigns? 
The  FTC  produces,  promotes,  and  disseminates  educational  messages  and  mate-
rials to the widest possible audience through multi-faceted communications and out-
reach  programs.  These  efforts  involve  the  use  of  print,  broadcast,  and  electronic 
media,  the  Internet,  special  events,  and  partnerships  with  other  government  agen-
cies, consumer groups, trade organizations, businesses, and other organizations. We 
design  our  materials  and  campaigns  to  be  relevant  to  the  specific  audiences  most 
affected by the topic at hand. 

Commission staff have developed creative and effective ways of reaching all types 
of  consumers  to  arm  them  with  the  information  they  need.  Indeed,  the  form  in 
which  the  information  is  presented  is  important  to  consumer  education  campaigns 
and,  therefore,  the  FTC  uses  a  variety  of  products  to  educate  consumers  and  busi-
nesses.  For  example,  the  FTC  uses  print  materials,  mini-CDs  containing  all  of  the 
FTC’s  credit  materials,  websites,  videos,  radio  public  service  announcements,  book-
marks, and signs on public transit vehicles. 

The FTC uses a number of ways to measure the reach of various aspects of a con-
sumer education campaign. For example, we track the distribution of printed publi-
cations—what  publications  are  ordered,  how  many,  and  by  what  organizations.  We 
also track visits to the websites we host that provide information online. In so doing, 
we are able to monitor the type of information that is of most interest to businesses 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

82 

and  consumers.  The  FTC  also  tracks  media  usage  of  its  consumer  education  infor-
mation,  and  we  pay  close  attention  to  what  consumers  report  to  our  counselors  on 
our  toll-free  help  line  and  to  our  website.  This  information  is  helpful  in  tracking 
trends  in  fraud  and  other  consumer  protection  issues  over  time.  In  addition,  the 
FTC  has  conducted  two  national  telephone  surveys  about  consumer  experiences 
with  fraud,  and  other  quantitative  and  qualitative  opinion  research  on  specific  con-
sumer experiences. 

However,  the  U.S.  and  global  marketplaces  are  incredibly  dynamic—with  many 
factors  at  work—so  it  is  difficult  to  attribute  changes  in  behavior  and  awareness 
over time to a single factor, such as a specific consumer education campaign. More-
over,  it  is  often  unclear  whether  an  increased  number  of  consumer  complaints  re-
flects the fact that a practice is becoming more widespread or that consumers have 
an  increased  awareness  about  where  they  should  report  the  unlawful  practice.  Al-
though the FTC can monitor certain aspects related to its consumer education cam-
paigns, such as the number of visitors to a ‘‘branded’’ website, the number of publi-
cations  ordered,  the  partner  organizations  ordering  information  to  disseminate  on 
our  behalf,  or  the  media  pick-up,  it  is  difficult  to  extrapolate  from  those  numbers 
the extent to which preventive efforts have been effective. 
D.  What  specific  outreach  is  the  FTC  doing  regarding  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue 

scams beyond online consumer education? 

In  February  2008,  the  FTC  started  to  use  a  variety  of  methods  to  alert  people  to 
mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  scams.  Working  with  the  media,  Federal,  state  and 
local  agencies,  partner  organizations  and  others—to  help  us  extend  our  reach  and 
get the biggest bang for our buck—the FTC produced and distributed public service 
announcements  for  print,  online  and  radio;  produced  brochures  that  have  been  dis-
tributed  by  law  enforcement  partners,  placed  articles  in  community  newspapers 
across  the  nation,  encouraged  Congressional  staff  to  run  the  information  in  their 
own  constituent  newsletters;  and  participated  in  local  law  enforcement  task  forces. 
Indeed,  FTC  staff  sent  an  article  adapted  from  our  consumer  education  materials 
to  a  national  syndicated  news  service,  which,  in  turn,  sent  it  to  more  than  10,000 
community  newspapers.  The  English  version  of  the  article  generated  more  than 
1,000  placements  in  more  than  30  states  with  a  readership  of  more  than  127  mil-
lion. The Spanish version has generated more than 35 newspaper articles in 5 states 
with a readership of more than 2.6 million. 

Educating consumers about these scams remains a high priority and we are work-
ing  with  coalitions  of  mortgage  servicers  and  others  active  in  the  mortgage  arena 
to do targeted foreclosure rescue scam prevention education throughout the Nation. 
Additionally,  moving  forward,  our  outreach  plans  on  foreclosure  rescue  scams  and 
loan  modification  scams  include  using  public  transportation  systems  to  get  out  the 
HOPE  Now  telephone  number  and  related  websites,  and  producing  videos  for  the 
Web and for use at events about foreclosure rescue and loan modification scams. 
III. Question for the Record from Senator Warner 

Question.  A  recent  FTC  report  recommends  that  reforms  to  the  Fair  Debt  Collec-
tion  Practices  Act  are  warranted  with  respect  to  ‘‘new  and  emerging  technologies.’’ 
Specifically,  the  report  recommends  that  debt  collectors  be  permitted  to  contact 
debtors  by  cell  phone  if  they  have  prior  consumer  consent.  However,  I’ve  heard 
about  debt  collectors  using  social  networking  websites  such  as  Facebook  and 
MySpace  to  contact  and/or  harass  debtors.  Other  than  the  issue  of  contacting  debt-
ors  by  cell  phone,  what  are  the  FTC’s  plans,  if  any,  to  protect  debtors  from  over-
zealous debt collectors with respect to social networking websites and other ‘‘emerg-
ing’’ technologies? 

Answer. In the FTC’s Debt Collection Workshop Report, entitled ‘‘Collecting Con-
sumer  Debts:  The  Challenges  of  Change,’’  the  Commission  stated  that  third  party 
collectors (‘‘debt collectors’’) generally should be permitted to use all communications 
technologies,  including  new  and  emerging  technologies  such  as  social  networking 
sites, to contact consumers. The FTC emphasized however, that debt collectors who 
use  such  new  technologies  to  contact  consumers  must  not  engage  in  unfair,  decep-
tive,  or  abusive  acts  and  practices  in  violation  of  the  Fair  Debt  Collection  Practices 
Act (FDCPA), and creditors collecting on their own debts must not engage in unfair 
or deceptive acts and practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. 

While the FTC’s report concluded that the FDCPA should be modernized to adapt 
to  changes  in  new  technology,  current  law  clearly  prohibits  certain  practices  now. 
For  example,  a  debt  collector  would  violate  the  FDCPA  if  it  posted  information 
about  a  consumer’s  debt  on  the  public  portion  of  his  or  her  page  on  a  social  net-
working site. Section 805(b) of the FDCPA generally prohibits collectors from reveal-
ing  the  existence  of  a  debt  to  anyone  other  than  the  consumer,  the  consumer’s 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:52 Jun 15, 2009 Jkt 050180 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\50108.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

83 

spouse, or the consumer’s attorney. Section 806(3) of the FDCPA also generally pro-
hibits  collectors  from  publicizing  lists  of  consumers  who  allegedly  refuse  to  pay 
debts.  A  collector  rho  posts  information  about  a  consumer’s  debt  on  the  public  por-
tion  of  his  or  her  page  on  a  social  networking  site  likely  would  violate  one  or  both 
of these FDCPA provisions. 

The  Commission  intends  to  closely  monitor  the  use  of  new  technologies  by  debt 
collectors to make sure that they are complying with the law. With regard to social 
networking sites, in particular, the FTC has received very few complaints about col-
lectors  contacting  consumers  via  social  networking  sites  or  posting  information 
about  consumers  on  these  sites.  State  officials  who  enforce  laws  similar  to  the 
FDCPA  likewise  report  an  absence  of  debt  collection  complaints  relating  to  social 
networking  sites.  Although  there  currently  appear  to  be  few  consumer  complaints 
about this topic, because communication through social networking sites is likely to 
continue  to  increase,  the  FTC  will  monitor  this  area  to  prevent  collectors  from  vio-
lating  the  law  in  connection  with  using  this  method  of  communication  to  contact 
consumers. 
IV. Questions for the Record from Senator Boxer 

Question  1.  Where  does  the  FTC  rank  combating  mortgage  foreclosure  scams  on 

its priority list? 

Answer. Combating mortgage foreclosure scams is a top priority. We have brought 
cases  against  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  scams  targeted  at  homeowners  facing 
foreclosure,  and  are  now  seeing  companies  make  deceptive  loan  modification  offers 
to  borrowers  who  are  not  yet  in  foreclosure.  We  are  devoting  substantial  resources 
to law enforcement and consumer education initiatives in this area. 

Question 2. What are you seeing that is new with respect to mortgage scams? 
Answer.  With  the  advent  of  the  array  of  Federal-sponsored  or  supported  loan 
modification  programs,  marketers  are  now  touting  loan  modification  programs  in 
addition to the prevalent foreclosure assistance scams. Some loan modification firms 
recruit  unemployed  mortgage  brokers  who  know  the  mortgage  market  and  can  im-
press borrowers with their technical knowledge. 

Question 3. Is additional legislation needed to address mortgage fraud? 
Answer.  The  FTC  has  used  its  existing  authority  under  Section  5  of  the  FTC  to 
reach unfair or deceptive acts or practices in this area. The omnibus budget bill just 
passed  by  the  Congress  directs  the  Commission  to  initiate  a  rulemaking  regarding 
mortgage  loans.  We  anticipate  using  this  new  authority  to  address  unfair  or  decep-
tive  loan  modification  or  foreclosure  assistance  practices,  in  addition  to  other  prac-
tices related to mortgage loans. 

Question 4. The State of California has taken steps to discourage mortgage fraud 
by working to prohibit mortgage brokers and real estate agents from collecting fees 
before rendering services. Would the FTC support this type of legislation? 

Question  5.  Have  you  found  cases  where  attorneys  are  participating  in  mortgage 
foreclosure rescue fraud? Is there legitimate work being performed by either brokers 
or lawyers that would merit an advanced fee? 

Answer.  In  response  to  questions  4  and  5,  I  agree  that  advance  fees  charged  by 
companies purportedly offering mortgage loan modification or foreclosure assistance 
services are extremely problematic as many consumers report that, after paying the 
fee, the companies do little or nothing to help consumers as promised. However, we 
know  that  some  state  laws,  such  as  California’s  law,  exempt  attorneys  from  cov-
erage of the advance fee ban which has led to some companies either adopting ‘‘law 
firm’’  in  their  name  or  affiliating  with  a  law  firm  or  lawyers  to  take  advantage  of 
the exemption. We are discussing the effect of these state laws with state enforcers 
and  are  exploring  uses  of  the  FTC’s  existing  authority  to  determine  the  best  way 
to address this practice. 

Question 6. Have you seen an increase in cases where homeowners who have not 

received Notices of Default are being targeted in mortgage fraud? 

Answer.  Yes,  as  discussed  in  response  to  Question  2,  above,  marketers  are  now 
touting  loan  modification  services,  particularly  in  light  of  both  private  and  govern-
ment-backed  loan  modification  plans  that  are  being  widely  publicized.  Generally, 
based  on  our  enforcement  experience  in  mortgage  foreclosure  fraud,  both  home-
owners in foreclosure as well as homeowners who were not in financial trouble have 
consistently been targeted. 

Notices  of  Default  bring  up  a  troubling  problem.  Some  states  have  an  expedited 
non  judicial  foreclosure  procedures  (e.g.  Georgia)  such  that,  when  homeowners  re-
ceive  notice  of  default,  it  is  almost  too  late  to  do  anything  to  save  the  mortgage 
other  than  pay  the  entire  arrearage  plus  fees.  Promises  of  foreclosure  assistance  in

those  instances  are  particularly  pernicious  given  that  the  chance  of  averting  fore-
closure is unlikely.
