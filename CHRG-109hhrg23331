HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

NOAA Hurricane Forecasting

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2005

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose:

On October 7, 2005 at 10:00 a.m., the House Science Committee will hold a hear-
ing  on  hurricane  forecasting  by  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administra-
tion  (NOAA).  The  Committee  is  holding  the  hearing  to  better  understand  the  pre-
diction  of  hurricanes  and  the  outlook  for  the  remainder  of  the  2005  hurricane  sea-
son.

The Committee plans to explore several overarching questions:

1. What are the different responsibilities of the National Hurricane Center and
local  weather  forecast  offices  when  a  tropical  storm  or  hurricane  threatens
the United States?

2. What  were  the  timelines  of  Katrina  and  Rita  progressing  from  tropical  de-
pressions  to  major  hurricanes  and  when  were  warnings  issued  to  the  public
and to federal, State, and local officials? Was there any difference in how the
National  Weather  Service  forecast  and  issued  warnings  for  these  two  major
hurricanes?

3. What  is  the  outlook  for  the  remainder  of  the  2005  hurricane  season  and  for
the  next  five  to  10  years?  Are  we  in  a  period  of  increased  hurricane  fre-
quency and/or intensity? If so, what is the likely cause of this increase?

4. What can be done to improve prediction of hurricanes, both in the short-term

and in the long-term?

Witnesses:
Brigadier General David L. Johnson (ret.), Director of NOAA’s National Weath-
er Service.
Mr. Max Mayfield, Director of the National Weather Service’s National Hurricane
Center.

Background:
What Are Hurricanes?

The  terms  ‘‘hurricane’’  and  ‘‘typhoon’’  are  regionally  specific  names  for  a  strong
‘‘tropical cyclone.’’ A tropical cyclone is the generic term for a low-pressure weather
system  over  tropical  or  sub-tropical  waters  with  organized  thunderstorm  activity.
Tropical  cyclones  with  maximum  sustained  surface  winds  of  less  than  39  mph  are
called  ‘‘tropical  depressions.’’  Once  the  tropical  cyclone  reaches  winds  of  at  least  39
mph,  it  is  called  a  ‘‘tropical  storm’’  and  assigned  a  name.  If  winds  reach  74  mph
then  the  storm  is  called  a  ‘‘hurricane’’  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  or  a  ‘‘typhoon’’  in  the
Pacific Ocean. Typically, the more intense a tropical cyclone is, the less area it cov-
ers. Hurricane Katrina was unusual in that it both was very intense and very large
(400 miles across).

The United States utilizes the Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale to give an
estimate  of  the  potential  flooding  and  damage  to  property  given  a  hurricane’s  esti-
mated intensity. The scale is summarized in Appendix A.
How Hurricanes Are Forecast

In  the  United  States,  the  Atlantic  hurricane  season  is  from  June  1  to  November
30. The National Weather Service (NWS), which is part of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the Department of Commerce, has responsi-
bility  ‘‘to  provide  weather,  hydrologic,  and  climate  forecasts  and  warnings  for  the
United  States,  its  territories,  and  adjacent  waters,  for  the  protection  of  life  and
property  and  the  enhancement  of  the  national  economy.’’  The  National  Hurricane

Center in Miami, which is part of NWS, monitors and forecasts tropical storms and
hurricanes in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans.

The  National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  compiles  data  about  ocean  temperature,
wind  speed  and  direction,  barometric  pressure,  and  other  factors  and  enters  that
data  into  computer  models  to  forecast  hurricanes.  This  data  is  obtained  from  sat-
ellites,  ocean  buoys  and  radars.  Also,  a  large  amount  of  data  comes  from  sensors
dropped  by  ‘‘hurricane  hunter’’  airplanes  as  they  fly  into  the  storms.  Hurricane
hunters are flown by the Air Force and NOAA out of Keesler Air Force Base in Mis-
sissippi  and  MacDill  Air  Force  Base  in  Florida.  The  planes  are  modified  to  carry
weather instruments to measure wind, pressure, temperature and dew point and to
drop  instrumented  sensors  into  hurricanes.  When  a  storm  is  within  three  days  of
potential landfall, hurricane hunters fly into the storm once every six hours.

When tracking a tropical storm or hurricane, the NHC issues official forecasts and
warnings every six hours. As a storm nears landfall, the forecasts are updated more
frequently.  The  information  goes  out  to  the  public  via  the  Internet  (http://
www.nhc.noaa.gov/)  and  through  NOAA  Weather  Radio.  NOAA  Weather  Radio  is  a
nationwide  network  of  radio  stations  broadcasting  continuous  weather  information
from  nearby  National  Weather  Service  offices.  Every  six  hours,  the  NHC  also  pro-
vides (via conference calls and the Internet) ‘‘technical discussion products’’ tailored
to federal, State, and local emergency managers and decision-makers. Local weather
forecast  offices  use  the  information  from  the  NHC  to  provide  advisories  tailored  to
their  region.  An  example  of  a  tailored  hurricane  advisory  from  the  New  Orleans
weather  forecast  office  is  provided  in  Appendix  B.  Whenever  a  hurricane  threatens
U.S.  territory,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA)  activates  the
Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT). This team consists of federal, State and local emer-
gency  managers,  NWS  meteorologists  and  computer  specialists  who  help  the  NHC
rapidly  exchange  information  with  federal,  State  and  local  emergency  managers.
The HLT works directly out of the NHC in Miami. For Hurricane Katrina, the HLT
was activated on Wednesday, August 24.
Timeline  of  Hurricane  Katrina  and  Hurricane  Rita  and  NWS  Warnings  to  Federal,

State and Local Officials

Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the southeast corner of Louisiana at 6:10 am
Central  Daylight  Time  (CDT)  on  Monday,  August  29  as  a  Category  4  storm  (max-
imum  sustained  winds  of  145  mph)  that  was  unusually  large,  measuring  approxi-
mately  400  miles  across.  At  5:00  pm  (CDT)  on  Friday,  August  26,  56  hours  before
Katrina made landfall, the National Weather Service forecast the storm hitting near
New Orleans as a Category 4 or 5 hurricane. NWS was very accurate with its fore-
cast  and  the  final  landfall  location  was  only  20  miles  off  from  Friday’s  forecast.
Since meteorological conditions that affect the track and intensity of the storm were
relatively stable, NWS was especially accurate in forecasting Katrina.

Between 7:00 and 8:00 pm CDT on Saturday August 27, 35 hours before landfall,
the  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center  called  State  officials  in  Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama. At 7:00 am on Sunday, August 28, NWS advisories stated
that  Katrina  was  a  ‘‘potentially  catastrophic’’  storm.  A  more  detailed  description  of
Katrina’s development from tropical storm to hurricane and the associated warnings
are provided in Appendix C.

Hurricane Rita made landfall near Port Arthur, TX around 2:30 am CDT on Sat-
urday, September 24 as a Category 3 storm (maximum sustained winds of 120 mph)
and  measuring  170  miles  across.  At  4:00  pm  CDT  on  Tuesday,  September  20,  the
National  Weather  Service  began  warning  that  northwestern  regions  of  the  Gulf  of
Mexico should prepare for a major hurricane.
Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita Compared to Previous Major Storms

While  Hurricane  Katrina  was  over  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  NOAA  measured  winds
reaching  175  mph,  making  it  the  strongest  hurricane  ever  measured  in  the  Gulf  of
Mexico.  By  the  time  it  hit  the  Gulf  Coast,  Katrina’s  winds  decreased  to  145  mph,
down to a Category 4 level but still a very strong storm. There have been three pre-
vious  Category  5  storms  (1935  Labor  Day  storm,  Florida  Keys;  1969  Camille,  Mis-
sissippi; and 1992 Andrew, south Florida) to hit the U.S. and six previous Category
4  storms  (2004  Charley,  1989  Hugo,  1961  Carla,  1960  Donna,  1957  Audrey,  1954
Hazel)  to  hit  the  U.S.  The  last  major  storm  affecting  New  Orleans  was  Hurricane
Betsy in 1965, during which winds hit 125 mph before equipment failed. Hurricane
Camille  (August  1969)  was  also  a  major  hit  but  made  landfall  east  of  the  city  and
was a more compact storm than either Betsy or Katrina. Hurricane Katrina was un-
usual in that it was both very intense and large.

Typically,  major  hurricanes  begin  in  the  eastern  Atlantic  ocean  near  Cape  Verde
in western Africa, providing forecasters many days to track, study, and warn of the

storms  before  they  threaten  U.S.  coasts.  Since  records  have  been  kept,  85  percent
of  major  Atlantic  hurricanes  have  originated  from  the  eastern  Atlantic.  However,
this  year  all  nine  tropical  depressions  that  developed  intro  hurricanes  did  not  form
until the systems were west of 55 degrees longitude (near Barbados), providing fore-
casters  only  a  couple  of  days  to  study  the  storms  and  citizens  less  time  to  prepare
their homes.

The last time such a large percentage of hurricanes formed in the western Atlan-
tic was in 1969, when 10 of 12 hurricanes formed west of 55 degrees latitude. That
was the year Hurricane Camille struck New Orleans. Scientists can determine after
the fact that the factors favoring quick formation of hurricanes in the Caribbean are
a  combination  of  favorable  wind  patterns  and  sea  surface  temperatures,  but  sci-
entists cannot predict these patterns ahead of time.
Outlook for Future Hurricanes

Hurricane Rita was the 13th named storm of the 2005 hurricane season. Typically
the  month  of  September  is  the  peak  month  for  hurricane  activity.  Through  Novem-
ber  30  (end  of  hurricane  season),  NOAA  expects  seven  to  10  additional  named
storms,  of  which  one  to  three  could  be  major  hurricanes  of  Category  3  strength  or
higher.  The  chance  of  one  of  those  major  hurricanes  making  landfall  somewhere  in
the  U.S.  is  21  percent.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  exactly  where  a  hurricane
would  hit  because  the  path  of  a  hurricane  is  primarily  determined  by  day-to-day
weather  patterns.  Historically,  weather  patterns  in  October  push  tropical  storms
north from the Caribbean and back out to sea, decreasing the chances that the Gulf
Coast  will  be  hit  by  another  hurricane.  However,  there  is  still  a  chance  that  the
Gulf could see another storm this year.

Most scientists agree that the Atlantic Ocean is currently in a period of increased
hurricane activity, which is part of a natural 25- to 40-year cycle known as the ‘‘At-
lantic multi-decadal signal,’’ a shift in the sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic.
Warmer  sea  surface  temperatures  combined  with  optimal  wind  conditions  cause
more  tropical  depressions  to  develop  into  hurricanes.  Scientists  are  unsure  of  the
cause  of  the  natural  temperature  and  wind  shifts  in  the  Atlantic.  The  last  period
of high tropical Atlantic activity was 1920–1966. The average number of hurricanes
in  a  warm  period  is  10  per  year,  while  the  average  number  of  hurricanes  in  a  cold
period  is  six  storms  per  year.  Today,  many  more  people  live  in  hurricane  prone
areas  than  during  the  last  period  of  high  tropical  activity,  meaning  that  today’s
storms  will  affect  more  people  and  cause  more  damage  than  historical  storms.  Ap-
pendix  D  contains  more  detail  on  the  Atlantic  multi-decadal  signal  and  hurricane
frequency.

While  most  scientists  agree  that  the  current  increase  in  hurricane  frequency  is
not  due  to  global  climate  change,  over  the  next  50  years  hurricane  intensity  (not
frequency) could increase as ocean temperatures rise. Also, two recent studies have
shown  some  evidence  that  current  hurricane  intensity  has  slightly  increased  since
1970.  The  first  study,  published  in  Nature  in  July,  looked  at  the  North  Atlantic
Ocean  and  found  that  hurricane  intensity  has  increased  50  percent  in  the  past  50
years.1 The  second  study,  published  in  Science  in  September,  looked  globally  at  all
oceans  and  found  that  the  number  of  Category  4  and  5  hurricanes  has  nearly  dou-
bled  each  decade  since  1970,  while  the  total  number  of  hurricanes  has  remained
constant.2
Improving Hurricane Forecasts

In  1954,  the  NHC  first  issued  one-day  forecasts  of  hurricanes.  Since  1964,  the
NHC  has  provided  three-day  hurricane  forecasts.  In  2003,  the  forecasts  were  ex-
tended  to  include  five-day  predictions.  Appendix  E  contains  examples  of  the  five-
and three-day forecasts for Hurricane Katrina. Today, a three-day forecast is as ac-
curate  as  those  issued  for  a  two-day  prediction  in  the  late  1980s.  While  NHC  has
significantly improved the forecast of where a hurricane is likely to go, the forecasts
of hurricane intensity have not improved at the same pace.

NOAA currently supports research in its own labs and provides grants to univer-
sities  to  try  to  improve  hurricane  forecasts.  Other  agencies  that  support  this  type
of  research  include  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  the  National  Aeronautics
and  Space  Administration.  The  most  useful  information  to  researchers  comes  from
taking observations from hurricane hunter airplanes and ocean buoys during a real
hurricane,  which  can  be  used  to  develop  new  forecasting  models.  As  Congress  de-
bates supplemental spending and regular agency budgets, some experts think an ad-
ditional  hurricane  hunter  airplane  equipped  with  research  sensors  would  help  re-

searchers  improve  computer  models  of  hurricane  intensity.  (Also,  NOAA  lost  some
facilities  during  Hurricane  Katrina  and  may  require  additional  funding  to  rebuild
those facilities.)

• 10:00  am  CDT  Saturday  August  27:  At  44  hours  before  landfall,  the  NWS
issued  a  hurricane  watch  including  New  Orleans.  A  hurricane  watch  advises
of  possible  hurricane  conditions,  with  the  objective  of  providing  36  hours  no-
tice. The watch for Katrina surpassed that objective by eight hours.

• 4:00 pm CDT Saturday August 27: At 42 hours before landfall, the hurricane

watch was extended to Mississippi and Alabama.

• 7:25  pm  CDT  Saturday  August  27:  Max  Mayfield  (Director  of  the  National

Hurricane Center) called Gov. Blanco of Louisiana.

• 7:35  pm  CDT  Saturday  August  27:  Max  Mayfield  called  Bill  Filter,  Chief  of

Operations for Alabama Emergency Management Agency.

Orleans.

• 10:00  pm  CDT  Saturday  August  27:  At  32  hours  before  landfall,  the  NWS
issued a hurricane warning that included New Orleans. A hurricane warning
advises  that  a  hurricane  will  likely  hit,  with  the  objective  of  providing  24
hours  lead  time.  The  watch  for  Katrina  surpassed  that  objective  by  eight
hours.  Every  NWS  warning  beginning  Saturday  evening,  32  hours  before
landfall,  stated  that  ‘‘Preparations  to  protect  life  and  property  should  be
rushed  to  completion’’  and  predicted  coastal  storm  surge  of  at  least  15  to  25
feet.

• 7:00 am CDT Sunday August 28: Every NWS warning beginning 23 hours be-
fore landfall, began with the headline indicating that Hurricane Katrina could
be  ‘‘Potentially  Catastrophic.’’  Due  to  the  advanced  warning  provided  by
NWS,  a  mandatory  evacuation  was  put  in  place  for  New  Orleans  on  Sunday
morning (24 hours before landfall) and the President declared a state of emer-
gency  on  Sunday,  meaning  that  Louisiana  could  use  federal  resources  before
the hurricane hit. Typically, the President waits until after an event.

Chairman BOEHLERT.Thank you for being here today at this long
awaited  hearing.  We  had  hoped  to  have  this  hearing  back  in  Sep-
tember but we postponed it twice, once because Hurricane Ophelia
was  developing  and  once  to  give  the  chance  for  the  Select  Com-
mittee to get started with its investigation.

I participated in the Select Committee’s hearing and I made clear
then that the Science Committee retained all of its jurisdiction and
interest  in  this  subject  and  that  we  would  be  rescheduling  our
hearing  today  and  that  is  why  we  are  here  today.  Unfortunately,
because  of  the  Energy  Bill  on  the  Floor,  my  attendance  today  will
be  intermittent,  but  my  focus  will  not.  And  incidentally,  that  is
calling  the  attention  of  so  many  of  our  colleagues  because  of  the
significance of the bill on the Floor.

The National Weather Service is probably the agency we oversee
that has the most impact on the every day lives of our constituents,
and  we  want  to  make  sure  we  do  everything  we  can  to  make  sure
it  is  in  top  form.  Based  on  its  recent  performance  trialed  by  water
one  might  say,  I  do  not  think  we  have  too  much  to  worry  about
when  it  comes  to  the  Weather  Service.  Let  me  repeat  what  I  said
at  the  Select  Committee’s  hearing.  The  National  Weather  Service
performed  magnificently  in  tracking  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita
and  in  providing  information  before,  during,  and  after  the  hurri-
canes  made  landfall.  Max  Mayfield  was  the  indispensable  man  in
the  lead  up  to  the  storms  and  we  owe  the  entire  staff  of  the  Na-
tional Weather Service a debt of gratitude and that comes with all
the sincerity that I can command.

The  men  and  women  of  the  Weather  Service  and  the  men  and
women of the Armed Forces who fly into hurricanes to get data on
storms get no special perks if they have had a rough couple of days
or a bad season. They have to be ready for the next storm.

I was talking the other day to Deputy Secretary Sampson of the
Commerce Department and he had just been down to visit the Na-
tional Hurricane Center. He said that morale at the center was suf-
fering because the staff felt so saddened that Katrina had produced
such  suffering.  That  speaks  volumes  about  the  kind  of  people  we
have working for us down there.

In  all  reality,  all  the  Weather  Service  can  do  is  provide  the  best
information they can, which in the case of Katrina happened to be
especially  accurate  because  conditions  were  ideal  for  monitoring
the storm. In short, the Weather Service can lead officials to infor-
mation but they cannot make them think or act, I might add. Now
that does not mean of course that nothing can be improved, we will
want  to  see  and  hear  today  about  any  steps  the  Weather  Service
is  taking  to  ensure  that  Federal,  State,  and  local  officials  are  re-
ceiving  the  information  that  the  Weather  Service  is  putting  out.
But  it  is  not  the  Weather  Service’s  job  and  it  can’t  be  to  ensure
that others are heeding its warnings.

So  I  hope  we  will  not  be  asking  our  witnesses  today  questions
that  fall  beyond  their  purview.  I  also  hope  that  we  can  ask  ques-
tions beyond rehearsing the prelude to the most recent storms. We
should  be  looking  for  information  about  the  rest  of  the  hurricane
season,  it  is  not  over  yet,  about  what  is  behind  the  increased  fre-
quency  and  intensity  of  hurricanes.  And  most  important,  about
what  tools  the  National  Weather  Service  needs  to  continue  to  im-

prove  its  ability  to  forecast  and  track  storms.  If  nothing  else,  the
horrifying events of recent weeks have underscored the value of the
National Weather Service. We need to work together to make sure
that the Weather Service can provide the best information possible.
With that, it is my pleasure to recognize the distinguished Rank-

ing Member, Mr. Gordon of Tennessee.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I  want  to  thank  everyone  for  being  here  today  at  this  long  awaited  hearing.  We
had hoped to have this hearing back in September, but we postponed it twice—once
because  Hurricane  Ophelia  was  developing  and  once  to  give  the  Select  Committee
a chance to get started with its investigation.

I  participated  in  the  Select  Committee’s  hearing,  and  I  made  clear  then  that  the
Science  Committee  retained  all  its  jurisdiction—and  interest—in  this  subject  and
that we would be rescheduling our hearing. And that is why we are here today.

Unfortunately, because of the Energy Bill on the Floor, my attendance today will
be  intermittent,  but  my  focus  is  not.  The  National  Weather  Service  is  probably  the
agency  we  oversee  that  has  the  most  impact  on  the  everyday  lives  of  our  constitu-
ents, and we want to do everything we can to make sure it is in top form.

Based on its recent performance—trial by water, one might say—I don’t think we
have too much to worry about when it comes to the Weather Service. Let me repeat
what  I  said  at  the  Select  Committee’s  hearing:  the  National  Weather  Service  per-
formed magnificently in tracking Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and in providing in-
formation before, during and after the hurricanes made landfall. Max Mayfield was
the  indispensable  man  in  the  lead-up  to  the  storms,  and  we  owe  the  entire  staff  of
the National Weather Service a debt of gratitude.

The  men  and  women  of  the  Weather  Service  and  the  men  and  women  of  the
armed forces who fly into the hurricanes to get data on storms get no special perks
if  they’ve  had  a  rough  couple  of  days  or  a  bad  season.  They  have  to  be  ready  for
the next storm.

I  was  talking  the  other  day  to  Deputy  Secretary  Sampson  of  the  Commerce  De-
partment,  and  he  had  just  been  down  to  visit  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  He
said that morale at the Center was suffering because the staff felt so saddened that

tions  were  ideal  for  monitoring  the  storm.  In  short,  the  Weather  Service  can  lead
officials to information, but they can’t make them think. Or act, I might add.

Now  that  doesn’t  mean,  of  course,  that  nothing  can  be  improved.  We’ll  want  to
hear  today  about  any  steps  the  Weather  Service  is  taking  to  ensure  that  federal,

questions that fall beyond their purview.

I  also  hope  that  we  can  ask  questions  that  go  beyond  rehearsing  the  prelude  to
the  most  recent  storms.  We  should  be  looking  for  information  about  the  rest  of  the
hurricane  season,  about  what  is  behind  the  increased  frequency  and  intensity  of
hurricanes,  and  most  important,  about  what  tools  the  National  Weather  Service
needs to continue to improve its ability to forecast and track storms.

If  nothing  else,  the  horrifying  events  of  recent  weeks  have  underscored  the  value
of  the  National  Weather  Service.  We  need  to  work  together  to  make  sure  that  the
Weather Service can provide the best information possible. Thank you.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  let  me  concur  with  your  comments  and  certainly  your  com-
pliments  to  the  Weather  Service  and  the  team  they  have  put  to-
gether.

This  hearing  today  is  vitally  important.  We  have  recently  been
reminded of both the power of weather and weather prediction and
I  look  forward  to  exploring  these  topics.  Over  the  years,  we  have
spent billions of dollars on the Weather Service to improve our ca-
pacity  to  predict  the  weather.  We  do  it  not  simply  because  it  is

good  science,  but  because  we  can  save  lives  if  we  provide  accurate
warnings  for  severe  weather  events.  We  have  also  spent  hundreds
of billions of dollars on homeland security. We do it to enhance our
capacity to stop terrorist attacks and to mobilize our nation’s forces
in  cases  of  catastrophic  incidents,  whether  by  terrorists  or  by  nat-
ural disaster.

The  goal  of  both  of  these  sets  of  expenditures  is  to  keep  Ameri-
cans  secure  and  to  come  to  their  aid  when  they  most  need  it.  In
the  last  few  weeks,  it  appears  that  one  of  these  systems  worked
and  one  of  these  systems  failed.  And  failure  has  consequences.  In
this  case,  some  of  those  who  died,  and  we  do  not  yet  know  how
many, they died because the Federal Government did not get there
in  time.  As  Walter  Maestri,  the  Emergency  Management  Chief  of
the Louisiana Jefferson Parish put it, ‘‘The cavalry did not arrive.’’
Information  regarding  the  power  of  Hurricane  Katrina  went
right  to  the  top.  One  of  our  witnesses  here  today  conducted  brief-
ings  that  included  President  Bush,  Secretary  Chertoff,  and  Under
Secretary Brown. May I have the first chart?

Chertoff  is  the  head  of  that  center  and  information  is  supposed  to
flow up to the secretary from its work and also to President Bush.
So  the  information  from  the  Weather  Service  was  flowing  to  our
emergency  response  leaders  through  two  paths,  and  yet  our  Gov-
ernment  seemed  taken  by  surprise.  FEMA  Head,  Michael  Brown
said  on  CNN  on  August  31  and  I  quote,  ‘‘I  must  say,  this  storm  is
much bigger than anyone expected.’’

Is  it  possible  that  the  Weather  Service  simply  wasn’t  being  ar-

think that to be true, but we have a chance today to confirm it. Ap-
parently,  one  of  our  witnesses  didn’t  think  it  was  true  either.  Mr.
Mayfield, according to the St. Petersburg Times story on August 30
based  on  an  interview  with  Max  Mayfield  in  Chart  3  and  I  will
quote that. ‘‘On Sunday night, Mayfield was so worried about Hur-
ricane  Katrina  that  he  called  the  Governors  of  Louisiana,  Mis-
sissippi,  and  the  Mayor  of  New  Orleans.  On  Sunday,  he  even
talked about the forces of Katrina during a video conference call to
President Bush at his ranch in Crawford Texas.’’ ‘‘I just wanted to
be able to go to sleep that night knowing I did all I could do,’’ said
Mr. Mayfield.

On  Sunday,  Mr.  Mayfield  conducted  his  regular  presentation  to
the  Hurricane  Liaison  Team/FEMA  conference  call.  According  to

Mr.  Mayfield’s  press  account  and  the  government’s  records,  the
President  and  Secretary  Chertoff  and  Undersecretary  Brown  were

sources that President Bush and Chertoff were both on the line on
the August 28 briefing.

On  the  screen  is  a  photograph  released  by  the  White  House  of

In an article printed in the September 4 Times Picayune of New
Orleans, Mr. Mayfield said reacting to the claims by some that the
storms  surprised  them  in  its  veracity  and  consequences,  Chart  5,
and  I  quote,  ‘‘We  were  briefing  them  way  before  landfall.  It  is  not
that  this  is  a  surprise.  We  had  advisories  that  the  levee  could  be
topped.  I  kept  looking  back  to  see  if  there  was  anything  else  we
could do, could have done, and I just don’t know what it would be.’’
So I hope today in your testimony, Mr. Mayfield, you can address
whether anything else has come to your mind that could have been
done to get the attention of our emergency response leaders.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
This hearing today is vitally important. We’ve recently been reminded of both the
power of weather and weather prediction, and I look forward to exploring these top-
ics.

Over the years, we’ve spent billions of dollars on the Weather Service to improve
our  capacity  to  predict  the  weather.  We  do  it  not  simply  because  it  is  good  science,
but  because  we  can  save  lives  if  we  provide  accurate  warnings  of  severe  weather
events.

We  have  also  spent  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  on  homeland  security.  We  do
it  to  enhance  our  capacity  to  stop  terrorist  attacks  and  to  mobilize  our  nation’s
forces  in  cases  of  catastrophic  incidents—whether  by  terrorism  or  by  natural  dis-
aster.

The  goal  in  both  sets  of  expenditures  is  to  keep  Americans  secure  and  to  come

to their aid when they most need it.

In  the  last  few  weeks,  one  of  these  systems  worked  and  one  of  these  systems
failed.  And  failure  has  consequences—in  this  case  some  of  those  who  died,  and  we
do  not  yet  know  how  many,  they  died  because  the  Federal  Government  did  not  get
there in time. As Walter Maestri, the Emergency Management Chief for Louisiana’s
Jefferson Parish put it: ‘‘the cavalry didn’t arrive.’’

The information regarding the power of Hurricane Katrina went right to the top.
One  of  our  witnesses  here  today  conducted  briefings  that  included  the  President,
Secretary Chertoff and Under Secretary Brown.

The  other  witness  heads  an  agency  which  has  placed  an  employee  inside  the
nerve  center  for  the  Federal  Government’s  response  to  catastrophes:  the  Homeland
Security Operations Center (HSOC).

As the graphic on the screen demonstrates, Secretary Chertoff is the head of that
center  and  information  is  supposed  to  flow  up  to  the  Secretary  from  its  work  and
also to the President.

So  the  information  from  the  Weather  Service  was  flowing  to  our  emergency  re-
sponse  leaders  through  two  paths  and  yet  our  government  seemed  taken  by  sur-
prise.

FEMA  head  Michael  Brown  said  on  CNN  on  August  31,  ‘‘I  must  say,  this  storm

is much bigger than anyone expected.’’

Is  it  possible  that  the  Weather  Service  simply  wasn’t  being  articulate  about  the
nature  of  the  threat  posed  by  Katrina?  I  don’t  think  that  to  be  true,  but  we  will
have a chance today to confirm it.

Apparently one of our witnesses didn’t think it was true. Mr. Mayfield. According
to  a  St.  Petersburg  Times  story  on  August  30,  based  on  an  interview  with  Max
Mayfield:

‘‘On  Saturday  night,  Mayfield  was  so  worried  about  Hurricane  Katrina  that  he
called  the  Governors  of  Louisiana  and  Mississippi  and  the  Mayor  of  New  Orle-
ans.  On  Sunday,  he  even  talked  about  the  force  of  Katrina  during  a  video  con-
ference call to President Bush at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.’’
‘‘I just wanted to be able to go to sleep that night knowing that I did all I could
do,’’ Mayfield said.

On Sunday Mr. Mayfield conducted his regular presentation to the Hurricane Li-
aison  Team/FEMA  conference  call.  According  to  Mr.  Mayfield’s  press  account  and
government  records  the  President,  Secretary  Chertoff  and  Under  Secretary  Brown

were  on  calls  either  Saturday  or  Sunday  and  we  know  from  other  sources  that  the
President and Chertoff both were on line for the August 28 briefing.

pating  in  this  video  teleconference.  On  the  screen  in  front  of  the  President  is  Max
Mayfield  and  over  Mr.  Mayfield’s  shoulder  is  an  image  of  a  powerful  storm:  Hurri-
cane Katrina.

In  an  article  printed  in  the  September  4  Times  Picayune  of  New  Orleans  Mr.
Mayfield  said,  reacting  to  the  claims  by  some  that  the  storm  surprised  them  in  its
ferocity and consequences.

‘‘We  were  briefing  them  way  before  landfall.. . .  It’s  not  like  this  is  a  surprise.
We  had  the  advisories  that  the  levee  could  be  topped.  I  keep  looking  back  to  see
if there was anything else we could have done, and I just don’t know what it would
be.’’

I hope in your testimony Dr. Mayfield you can address whether anything else has
come  to  mind  that  you  could  have  done  to  get  the  attention  of  our  emergency  re-
sponse leaders.

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Dr. Ehlers.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In  the  last  six  weeks,  two  of  the  strongest  hurricanes  ever  re-
corded in the Gulf of Mexico hit the Gulf Coast region. Hurricanes
Katrina  and  Rita  left  a  wake  of  devastation  and  destroyed  the
homes  and  disrupted  the  livelihoods  of  countless  Americans.  My
prayers  continue  to  go  out  to  the  victims  of  these  horrible  events.
Experts  agree  that  the  Atlantic  Ocean  is  in  a  natural  period  of
increased  tropical  storm  activity.  The  last  time  were  in  an  active
period  like  this  was  1920  to  1966.  Obviously,  these  are  very  long-
term  cycles.  However,  today  many  more  people  live  in  hurricane-
prone  areas.  To  help  prepare  and  respond  better  in  the  future,  it
is  urgent  for  us  to  understand  the  forecasting  of  Katrina  and  Rita
and  what  future  hurricane  seasons  may  hold.  In  that  vein,  I  am
pleased  that  Chairman  Boehlert  organized  today’s  hearing  about
NOAA’s hurricane forecasting.

As the Chairman of the Environment and Technology and Stand-
ards  Subcommittee,  I  am  proud  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  At-
mospheric Administration’s Weather Service. The Weather Service,
in  particular  through  its  National  Hurricane  Center  in  Miami,
Florida, did an excellent job forecasting Katrina and Rita. Weather
Service  employees  worked  countless  long  hours  to  ensure  that  fed-
eral,  State,  and  local  officials  and  the  public  have  the  most  accu-
rate  and  up  to  date  information  about  dangerous  weather  events.
I applaud their hard work and look forward to learning more about
how they do it. And I also am very anxious to find out how we can
possibly  alert  the  public  anymore  than  has  already  been  done  to
make  certain  the  public  responds  and  doesn’t  take  it  for  granted.

I yield back.

am pleased that Chairman Boehlert organized today’s hearing about NOAA’s hurri-

As Chairman of the Environment, Technology, and Standards Subcommittee, I am
proud  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration’s  (NOAA)  National
Weather Service. The Weather Service, in particular through its National Hurricane
Center in Miami, Florida, did an excellent job forecasting Katrina and Rita. Weath-

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Dr. Ehlers.
Mr. Wu.
Mr.  WU.  As  Ranking  Member  of  the  Environment,  Technology,
and  Standards  Subcommittee,  I  would  like  to  begin  by  yielding
time to one of my several good friends who were affected by Hurri-
canes Katrina and Rita, in this case, Mr. Melancon, the gentleman
from Louisiana.

Mr. MELANCON. Thank you, Mr. Wu, I appreciate it.
As  you  all  know,  my  district  suffered  catastrophic  losses  and
damage, lots of lives during Hurricane Katrina. It is hard to relate
in  words  the  situation  that  Katrina  left  behind.  The  challenges  to
rebuilding  and  putting  the  South  Louisiana  area  back  together
again are complex and the progress will be slow.

The  loss  of  life,  livelihood,  homes  and  communities  defy  descrip-
tion but the courage and the resilience of the people of South Lou-
isiana  is  all  evident.  We  have  taken  a  mighty  blow  from  Mother
Nature  and  we  are  stunned,  but  we  are  still  standing  and  we  are
going  to  recover  from  this  and  restore  our  communities  but  we
have  a  long  and  hard  road  ahead.  The  Federal  Government  must
work  with  the  State  and  local  governments  to  rebuild  our  commu-
nities,  our  livelihoods,  and  the  natural  and  manmade  structures
that protect us from these storms.

We have heard criticism of the Government’s response at all lev-
els.  In  the  midst  of  all  this  finger  pointing,  however,  I  think  it  is
important  that  we  highlight  the  many  local  officials  who  took  care
of their people when the network to support them collapsed. If not
for  the  efforts  of  these  heroes,  many  people  would  not  have  been
evacuated and many of those who did not evacuate would not have
survived.  My  constituents  are  not  interested  in  partisan  bickering
or  Monday  morning  quarterbacking.  They  need  their  immediate
needs  addressed  and  they  need  to  have  help  to  rebuild  their  lives.
As  federal  officials,  we  need  to  ensure  the  Federal  Government
is  ready  to  respond  rapidly  to  future  situations  where  citizens  are
victimized  by  natural  or  manmade  disasters.  State  and  local  gov-
ernments cannot be expected to provide sustained response and as-
sistance  from  within  a  vast  devastated  area.  The  Federal  Govern-
ment  is  the  only  organization  with  the  resources  to  provide  the
type of emergency assistance our citizens need.

We can learn from some of the federal agencies that did perform
well,  such  as  the  National  Weather  Service  and  the  U.S.  Coast-
guard.  The  National  Weather  Service  worked  cooperatively  with
State  and  local  officials  and  with  the  media  to  get  information  out
to  the  public.  Their  forecasts  were  accurate  and  their  warnings
were clear. Without these forecast and warnings and the lead time
they  provided,  we  would  not  have  been  able  to  evacuate  as  many
people as we did and the loss of life would have been much greater.

Their  performance  emphasizes  the  need  for  Congress  to  ensure
that this agency stays adequately funded.

To  the  American  people  and  my  fellow  Members  on  this  com-
mittee,  I  thank  you.  You  have  reached  out  to  me  and  my  district
these  past  days  and  your  generosity  has  not  gone  unnoticed.  Rest
assured  with  your  help,  Louisianans  will  survive.  We  will  rebuild
and our state will be strong again.

On behalf of my constituents, I thank you, Mr. Mayfield and the
other employees of the Hurricane Center and the National Weather
Service  for  your  fine  work.  I  am  anxious  to  work  with  my  col-
leagues  on  the  Committee  to  ensure  that  NOAA  has  the  resources
it needs to continue to improve hurricane forecasting. Additionally,
I  would  also  want  to  ensure  that  NOAA’s  other  branches  have  the
resources they need to help us rebuild our coastal wetlands and our
fisheries.

On  behalf  of  the  people  of  Louisiana  and  I  would  believe  on  be-

half of the people of the entire Gulf Coast, I thank you.

With that, I yield back my time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  examine  hurricane  forecasting  by  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Admin-
istration  (NOAA).  The  devastating  affects  of  hurricanes  are  familiar  to  all  of  us.  In
the  wake  of  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita,  it  is  important  to  gain  a  better  under-
standing of the prediction of hurricanes and determine what can be done to improve
prediction of hurricanes, both in the short-term and the long-term.

Within  the  NOAA,  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  and  the  National  Hurri-
cane Center (NHC) predicted the severity of Hurricane Katrina and issued multiple
warnings  for  the  Gulf  Coast  as  early  as  5  pm  on  Thursday,  August  25th.  By  late
Sunday  night,  early  Monday  morning,  August  29th,  the  National  Hurricane  Center
issued  an  advisory  stating  ‘‘coastal  storm  surge  flooding  of  18  to  22  feet  above  nor-
mal tide levels. . .locally as high as 28 feet.. . .Some levees in the greater New Orle-
ans  could  be  overtopped.’’  This  is  not  an  instance  where  science  failed  us.  The
science  of  hurricane  prediction  has  increased  dramatically  with  observational  work
and research done by NOAA.

For  decades  FEMA,  the  Army  Corp  of  Engineers,  academics  and  other  federal,
State and local agencies have performed simulations and analyses to determine the
affect  of  a  hurricane  on  the  New  Orleans  area.  These  analyses  overwhelming  con-
cluded that should a Category 3, or higher, hurricane strike New Orleans, the result
would  be  catastrophic  flooding,  loss  of  property  and  life  with  or  without  a  levee
breach.  Simple  overtopping  of  the  levees  alone  was  predicted  by  the  Red  Cross  to
result in between 25,000–100,000 lives.

Hurricane Katrina revealed that despite billions of dollars in emergency response
preparation  and  a  complete  overhaul  of  the  federal  domestic  security  system  em-
bodied  in  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  Americans  are  not  secure  today
from the ravages of nature. Thus, within this chaos, one thing is clear; this disaster
was not the fault of the NOAA or their sub-components the NWS or the NHC. The
aftermath was not due to a failure of science to predict. The aftermath was a failure
of emergency response to act on sound engineering, oceanographic and atmospheric
science that predicted that Katrina could be devastating and the Gulf region in par-
ticular, New Orleans, because the city sits below sea level and is dependent on lev-
ees and pumps to keep the water out.

I  thank  the  witnesses  for  their  testimony  and  look  forward  to  hearing  what  the
outlook  is  for  the  remainder  of  the  2005  hurricane  season  and  for  improving  hurri-
cane predictions in the short- and long-term.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  devastated  thousands  of  lives  in  New  Orleans,

southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and other parts of the Southeast.

I am anxious to hear about how NOAA and the National Weather Service predict
hurricanes  and  how  we  as  legislators  can  remove  barriers  so  that  you  can  do  your
important work to the best of your ability.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, thank you for hosting this hearing.
I  am  pleased  that  the  Science  Committee  is  taking  this  very  important  step  to
exercise its oversight role, particularly after such horrific natural disasters have oc-
curred.  We  owe  it  to  the  American  public  to  do  everything  possible  to  make  sure
this type of tragedy never happens again.

After  reviewing  the  written  testimony  of  our  witnesses  it  is  clear  to  me  that
NOAA,  the  National  Weather  Service  and  the  National  Hurricane  Service  did  an
outstanding job predicting the course of Hurricane Katrina and the ensuing devasta-
tion  that  followed.  To  prevent  another  Katrina,  we  must  equip  the  National  Hurri-
cane  Center  and  keep  it  as  strong  as  it  is  today.  But,  we  must  also  look  outside
this  committee  and  revisit  many  of  the  policies  promoted  by  the  Bush  Administra-
tion,  reform  FEMA  and  ensure  that  funds  directed  toward  emergency  management
are held accountable.

General Johnson and Dr. Mayfield, we are pleased to have you with us and I look

forward to hearing your testimony.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Mr. Chairman, let me first thank you for holding this important hearing on hurri-

cane forecasting.

It  was  about  five  weeks  ago  that  we  first  heard  reports  of  a  hurricane  building
in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  and  heading  towards  our  coast.  We  had  heard  this  warning
many times before, but the size and the scale of this one was different. There hasn’t
been  a  hurricane  this  big  and  this  powerful  in  decades,  and  it  was  heading  toward
one  of  the  most  vulnerable  cities  in  the  country.  We  have  since  witnessed  the  awe-
some  destructive  power  Mother  Nature  still  commands  over  mankind.  Few  could
have  imagined  the  immense  devastation  and  human  suffering  Katrina  would  bring
to our shores.

If  there  is  something  positive  we  can  take  from  this  disaster,  however,  it  will  be
our collective national resolve to never allow this to happen again. While this event
is  still  fresh  in  our  memories,  we  must  learn  from  what  we  did  wrong,  strengthen
what  we  did  right  and  strive  to  find  new  ways  to  ensure  the  safety  of  the  citizens
of this country.

On  the  forefront  of  this  effort,  of  course,  are  the  fine  people  of  the  National  Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Administration.  Their  state-of-the-art  forecasting,  detection
and  tracking  systems  saved  hundreds,  if  not  thousands  of  lives  this  past  month.
Their  accuracy  in  the  forecasting  of  Katrina  was  outstanding,  and  very  impressive
in  Rita  as  well.  Questions  remain  to  be  answered  regarding  what  the  proper  re-
sponse  to  NOAA’s  warnings  should  have  been,  but  it  is  very  apparent  that  in  the
case  of  Rita  and  Katrina,  NOAA  performed  extremely  well,  and  we  commend  them
for that.

NOAA’s  impressive  performance  in  this  instance,  however,  serves  only  to  further
emphasize  the  need  for  more  work  in  the  area  of  hurricane  forecasting.  We  can’t
ever  expect  to  conquer  Mother  Nature,  or  turn  back  hurricanes  with  the  press  of
a  button.  In  the  wake  of  this  disaster,  however,  we  need  to  constantly  be  asking
each other ‘‘What more could we have done?’’

The  Committee  posed  some  very  difficult  questions  for  our  distinguished  panel,
that  I  hope  we  can  explore  today.  I  hope  those  questions  are  appropriately  ad-
dressed, with special attention to what can be done to improve forecasting of hurri-
canes in the future.

Thank  you  very  much  for  being  here  today.  I  am  sure  this  hearing  will  be  very
productive,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  testimony  from  the  panelists  as  well
as from my fellow colleagues.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Let me welcome our two distinguished visi-
tors,  Brigadier  General  David  L.  Johnson,  who  is  Director  of  the
NOAA  National  Weather  Service;  and  Mr.  Max  Mayfield,  who  is
the  Director  of  NOAA’s  Tropical  Prediction  Center  and  National
Hurricane  Center.  And  let  me  say  to  both  of  you  gentlemen,  I  can
speak, I think, for my colleagues of all persuasions from all regions
of  the  country,  we  appreciate  the  magnificent  performance  of  your
people  in  this  tragic  incident  and  we  are  so  proud  of  what  you  do
and do so well.

The purpose of this hearing, though, is not to give you additional
pats on the back, well deserved though they are. It is to go forward
and  to  try  to  determine  what  more  you  might  need,  what  assist-
ance we might be able to provide. But I stress my strong, personal
feeling  that  you  have  been  magnificent  in  the  performance  of  your

job.  I  cannot  say  that  about  every  other  official  at  every  level  of
government but I can say it about you two and all the people that
you represent. Thank you.

With that, our first witness, General Johnson, Director of the Na-

tional Weather Service. General, the Floor is yours.

STATEMENT  OF  BRIGADIER  GENERAL  DAVID  L.  JOHNSON
(RET.),  ASSISTANT  ADMINISTRATOR  FOR  WEATHER  SERV-
ICES;  DIRECTOR,  THE  NATIONAL  WEATHER  SERVICE,  NA-
TIONAL  OCEANIC  AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION,
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
Mr.  JOHNSON.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I
am  David  Johnson,  the  Assistant  Administrator  for  Weather  Serv-
ices at NOAA and Director of the National Weather Service. Thank
you  very  much  for  inviting  me  here  today  to  discuss  NOAA’s  role
in  forecasting  and  warning  the  public  about  hurricanes.  And  Mr.
Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  personally  and  all  of  the
Members of the Science Committee for your leadership in this area
and  for  your  support  last  year  when  you  provided  funding  to  get
us seven additional buoys and provide dollars for the Air Force Re-
serve  to  put  some  urgently  needed  instrumentation  on  their  air-
planes.  They  are  working  towards  getting  me  one  airplane  for  the
’06 season and then additional airplanes after that.

I am accompanied by Max Mayfield, my Director of the National
Hurricane  Center.  He  will  be  focusing  on  Hurricane  Katrina  and
Rita,  communicating  our  forecasts,  as  well  as  the  outlook  for  the
future. I will be focusing on our role in hurricane tracking and fore-
casting, as well as, ongoing and future research efforts.

NOAA’s  forecast  and  warnings  for  Hurricane  Rita  and  Katrina
pushed  the  limits  of  state-of-the-art  hurricane  prediction  and  our
current  continuous  research  efforts  including  observations,  mod-
eling, and expanded computational resources at NOAA and in part-
nership  with  other  federal  agencies  lead  to  our  current  predictive
capabilities  and  improved  ways  of  describing  uncertainty  in  pre-
diction.  But  NOAA’s  work  does  not  stop  there.  NOAA  assesses
damage  from  storms  and  evaluates  waterways  to  assist  dredging
operations,  reopening  our  nation’s  ports  and  waterways  impacted
by  the  storms.  NOAA  also  assesses  the  impact  to  area  fisheries,
supports  hazardous  materials  containment  and  abatement  efforts,
and we provide environmental data critical for post storm recovery
operations.

The mission of the National Weather Service is to issue weather,
water,  and  climate  forecasts  for  the  protection  of  life  and  property
and  the  enhancement  of  the  economy.  Nowhere  is  that  more  evi-
dent  than  in  the  hurricane  program.  Various  components  of  the
National Weather Service play important roles in the overall hurri-
cane  forecasting  and  warning  process  and  the  National  Hurricane
Center  within  the  NWS  has  been  the  centerpiece  of  our  nation’s
Hurricane Forecast and Warning Program for 50 years.

The National Hurricane Center, ably led by Max Mayfield, is re-
sponsible for predicting the path and intensity of the storm, issuing
coastal  hurricane  watches  and  warnings,  and  describing  broad  im-
pacts to the areas impacted, including projected storm surge levels.

After  each  hurricane  season,  your  Weather  Service  undertakes
an  effort  to  improve  how  we  can  communicate  our  information
more  clearly.  For  example,  after  the  2004  season,  we  focused  on
how to improve the communication of uncertainty. Again this year,
we  have  several  experimental  products  on  our  website  for  review.
We  will  do  a  hot  wash  after  this  season  to  see  how  we  can  do  our
job better.

Local National Weather Forecast Offices and River Forecast Cen-
ters also play a critical role in this process. They use their local ex-
pertise to refine National Hurricane Center advisories and provide
specific  detailed  information  about  storm  impacts  from  the  hurri-
cane to their local forecast area of responsibility.

Weather  forecast  office  staffs  have  detailed  knowledge  of  the
local  terrain  and  impacts  and  provide  this  information  through  di-
rect interaction with local emergency managers via their local fore-
cast  products  and  messages.  This  detailed  information  is  used  by
local  emergency  managers  in  their  evacuation  and  other  prepared-
ness decisions.

Using a combination of atmospheric and ocean observations from
satellites,  aircraft,  and  all  available  surface  data  over  the  ocean,
NOAA  conducts  experiments  to  better  understand  internal  storm
dynamics  and  interactions  between  a  hurricane  and  the  sur-
rounding  atmosphere  and  oceans.  Through  greater  understanding
of  the  physical  processes  in  advanced  hurricane  modeling,  NOAA
continually improves models for predicting hurricane intensity and
track.  These  numerical  modeling 
improvements,  once  dem-
onstrated,  are  then  transitioned  into  operations.  Our  track  fore-
casts  have  shown  consistent  improvement;  however,  we  have  not
seen a comparable improvement in our intensity forecasts.

From  a  scientific  point,  the  gaps  in  our  capabilities  fall  into  two
broad  categories.  First,  our  ability  to  measure  and  assess  the  cur-
rent  state  of  hurricane  and  its  environment  doing  that  analysis,
and second, our ability to predict the hurricane’s future state, that
is the forecast. We need to enhance our observation network. Many
of  the  enhancements  required  to  improve  hurricane  analyses  par-
ticularly  over  the  data  sparse  ocean  areas  will  be  addressed
through such programs as the Global Earth Observation System of
Systems or GEOSS, a ten-year international endeavor of which the
United States is a member and NOAA a key participant.

Predicting  hurricane  intensity  remains  an  acute  challenge.  Even
though we knew conditions were favorable for the storms to inten-
sify,  we  do  not  know  why  the  storm  underwent  its  rapid  inten-
sification  once  it  passed  the  Florida  Peninsula  and  reentered  the
gulf. We are now at the point in improving intensity forecasts that
we were at a decade ago with the track forecast. Our 2005 version
of  our  high  resolution  model  improved  some  of  the  intensity  fore-
casts over the current statistical models when we run them on last
year’s 2004 hurricanes. So we have potential there.

To  advance  hurricane  prediction,  especially  hurricane  and  size
forecasts,  NOAA  is  developing  the  Hurricane  Weather  and  Re-
search  Forecasting  System.  The  Weather  Service  works  with  the
research  community  to  incorporate  advanced  model  physics  into  a
hurricane  model  which  integrates  the  physical  interactions  of  the
atmosphere, land, and oceans into a single model. Our goal here is

to  couple  an  advanced  wave  model  with  a  dynamic  storm  surge
model  to  better  predict  coastal  impacts  of  waves  and  the  storm
surge.

Mr.  Chairman,  while  there  are  no  quick  fixes,  we  are  very  opti-
mistic  that  we  will  continue  to  make  advances  in  our  operational
forecast of tropical cyclone intensity, wind structure, size and rain-
fall in the near future.

So in conclusion, the government’s ability to observe, predict, and
respond  quickly  to  storm  events  is  critical  to  public  safety.  At
NOAA, we will continue our efforts to improve hurricane track and
intensity  forecasting  including  wind,  storm  surge,  and  rainfall
amounts.  We  will  also  continue  to  provide  the  technical  tools  and
planning expertise to states and local governments to help mitigate
future  natural  disasters  and  provide  our  assistance  for  response
and recovery.

With  that,  sir,  I  am  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  may

have.

[The  prepared  statement  of  Brigadier  General  Johnson  follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL DAVID L. JOHNSON

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  General  David  L.  Johnson,
Assistant  Administrator  for  Weather  Services  at  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  (NOAA)  in  the  Department  of  Commerce.  Thank  you  for  in-
viting me here today to discuss NOAA’s role in forecasting, and warning the public
about hurricanes, as well as NOAA’s essential role and activities following landfall.
The devastation along the Gulf Coast from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita
is like nothing I have witnessed before. It is catastrophic. Words cannot convey the
physical  destruction  and  personal  suffering  in  that  part  of  our  nation.  However,
without NOAA’s forecasts and warnings, the devastation and loss of life would have
been far greater.

NOAA’s forecasts and warnings for Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita pushed
the limits of state-of-the-art hurricane prediction. In partnership with DOD, NASA,
NSF,  and  other  federal  agencies,  the  long-term  continuous  research  efforts,  includ-
ing  observations,  modeling,  and  expanded  computational  resources  have  led  to
NOAA’s current predictive capabilities and improved ways of describing uncertainty
in  prediction.  But  NOAA’s  work  does  not  end  there.  NOAA  assesses  damage  from
storms and evaluates waterways to assist dredging operations, allowing our nation’s
ports and waterways impacted by the storm to open. NOAA also assesses the impact
to the areas’ fisheries, supports hazardous materials containment and abatement ef-
forts, and provides necessary data critical for post storm recovery operations.
The  Role  of  the  National  Weather  Service  in  Tracking,  Forecasting  and

Communicating the Threats of Hurricanes

The  mission  of  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  is  to  issue  weather,  water
and  climate  forecasts  and  warnings  for  the  protection  of  life  and  property  and  the
enhancement  of  the  national  economy.  Nowhere  is  that  more  evident  than  in  the
hurricane  program.  Various  components  of  the  NWS  play  important  roles  in  the
overall  hurricane  forecasting  and  warning  process.  The  National  Hurricane  Center
(NHC)  within  the  NWS  has  been  the  centerpiece  of  our  nation’s  hurricane  forecast
and warning program for 50 years. The mission of the NHC is to save lives, mitigate
property  loss,  and  improve  economic  efficiency  by  issuing  the  best  watches,  warn-
ings, and forecasts of hazardous tropical weather and by increasing the public’s un-
derstanding of these hazards.

NHC  tropical  cyclone  forecasts  are  issued  at  least  every  six  hours,  more  fre-
quently  during  landfall  threats,  and  include  text  messages  as  well  as  a  suite  of
graphical  products  depicting  our  forecasts  and  the  accompanying  probabilities  and
‘‘cone  of  uncertainty,’’  as  it  has  become  known.  The  NHC  is  responsible  for  pre-
dicting the path and intensity of the system, issuing coastal hurricane watches and
warnings,  and  describing  broad  impacts  to  the  areas  impacted,  including  projected
storm surge levels.

Local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) also play a crit-
ical  role  in  this  process.  The  WFOs  use  their  local  expertise  to  refine  NHC
advisories and provide specific, detailed information about the impacts from the hur-

31

ricane  to  their  local  forecast  area  of  responsibility.  Weather  forecast  staff  have  de-
tailed  knowledge  of  the  local  terrain  and  impacts,  and  provide  this  information
through  direct  interactions  with  local  emergency  managers  and  via  their  local  fore-
cast  products  and  messages.  This  detailed  information  is  used  by  local  emergency
managers  when  making  their  evacuation  and  other  preparedness  decisions.  The  ef-
fects of hurricanes can reach far inland and it is the responsibility of the local WFO
to  issue  inland  hurricane  and  tropical  storm  warnings  and  describe  the  local  im-
pacts  here  as  well.  These  inland  impacts  include  flood  and  flash  floods  as  well  as
tornadoes.
Tracking and Forecasting Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina began as a tropical depression near the southeastern Bahamas
on  Tuesday,  August  23,  2005.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted
it  would  become  a  Category  1  hurricane  before  making  landfall  near  Miami.  The
storm  deluged  southeast  Florida  with  16  inches  of  rain  in  some  places,  causing
downed trees, flooding, and extended power outages as it passed across the southern
portion of the state.

Once  Katrina  re-emerged  into  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  NOAA  hurricane  forecasters
correctly  predicted  re-intensification  of  the  storm.  Katrina  intensified  more  quickly
and became stronger than initially predicted. Within nine hours, Katrina intensified
from a tropical storm, with winds of 70 miles per hour, to a Category 2 storm with
100 mile per hour winds.

As you can see in the graphic below, our forecast track from Friday night (August
26),  about  56  hours  before  landfall,  had  the  storm  curving  northward  and  headed
directly  toward  southeastern  Louisiana  and  Mississippi.  The  projected  path  of
Katrina  aimed  directly  at  southeast  Louisiana,  and  the  prediction  was  for  Katrina
to  make  landfall  as  a  Category  4  hurricane.  The  actual  track  would  deviate  little
from  this  and  subsequent  forecasts  for  the  rest  of  Katrina’s  approach.  On  average,
NOAA  forecasts  of  where  Katrina  would  go  were  more  accurate  than  usual,  with
all  of  the  forecast  tracks  during  the  last  48  hours  lining  up  almost  directly  on  top
of  the  actual  track.  This  forecast  beats  the  Government  Performance  and  Results
Act goal established for NOAA hurricane forecasts this year.

At 10:00 am Central Daylight Time (CDT) Saturday morning, August 27, the Na-
tional Hurricane Center posted a hurricane watch for southeast Louisiana, including
the city of New Orleans. The hurricane watch extended eastward to Mississippi and
Alabama that afternoon. A hurricane watch means hurricane conditions are possible
in  the  specified  area,  usually  within  36  hours.  Messages  from  the  National  Hurri-

32

cane Center highlighted the potential for this storm to make landfall as a Category
4 or Category 5 storm.
Tracking and Forecasting Rita

Rita  began  as  a  tropical  depression  at  10:00  pm  CDT  Saturday,  September  17,
2005,  east  of  the  Turks  and  Caicos  Islands  north  of  the  Caribbean.  The  National
Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted  the  center  of  the  storm  to  pass  just  south  of
the  Florida  Keys  as  a  hurricane  on  Tuesday,  September  20,  and  predicted  it  to  be-
come  a  major  hurricane  as  it  moved  over  the  warm  waters  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.
Hurricane Rita continued to intensify in the Gulf of Mexico and became a Category
5 hurricane at 4:00 pm CDT Wednesday, September 21 with winds of 165 miles per
hour.

On Thursday, September 22, approximately two days before landfall, the forecast
track was shifted eastward to just west of the Louisiana/Texas border. Rita’s actual
track  would  deviate  little  from  this  and  subsequent  projections.  As  Hurricane  Rita
neared  landfall,  the  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted  its  decrease  in
intensity. Hurricane Rita made landfall as a Category 3 storm just east of Port Ar-
thur, Texas, near the Texas/Louisiana border.

Storm Surge

Storm  surge  has  caused  most  of  this  country’s  tropical  cyclone  fatalities,  all  too
vividly  evident  in  the  past  several  weeks,  and  represents  our  greatest  risk  for  a
large loss of life in this country. Following Hurricane Camille in 1969, NOAA estab-
lished a group that developed and implemented a storm surge model called SLOSH
(Sea,  Lake,  and  Overland  Surges  from  Hurricanes).  The  SLOSH  model  calculates
storm  surge  heights  resulting  either  from  historical,  hypothetical  or  actual  hurri-
canes.  SLOSH  incorporates  bathymetry  and  topography,  including  bay  and  river
configurations, roads, levees, and other physical features that can modify the storm
surge flow pattern. Comprehensive evacuation studies, conducted jointly by the Fed-
eral  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA),  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,
NOAA, and State and local emergency managers, are based on the simulated surges
computed by SLOSH.

The  National  Hurricane  Center  introduced  storm  surge  forecasts  for  the  Gulf
Coast  in  public  advisories  at  10:00  pm  CDT  Saturday—32  hours  prior  to  Katrina’s
landfall in Louisiana. The initial forecast (10:00 pm CDT, Saturday, August 27) for
storm surge was predicted at 15 to 20 feet, locally as high as 25 feet, and that fore-
cast  was  updated  the  following  morning  to  a  range  of  18  to  22  feet,  locally  as  high

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

33

as  28  feet,  when  the  forecast  intensity  for  landfall  was  increased.  ‘‘Large  and  bat-
tering’’ waves were forecast on top of the surge. In addition, the 4:00 pm CDT public
advisory  issued  by  the  National  Hurricane  Center  on  Sunday,  August  28,  stated
that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Actual storm
surge values are being determined at this time.

Storm  surge  values  for  Rita  were  also  issued  well  in  advance  of  landfall.  At
10:00am  CDT  on  September  22,  40  hours  before  landfall,  the  National  Hurricane
Center predicted a storm surge of ‘‘. . .15 to 20 feet above normal tide levels, along
with  large  and  dangerous  battering  waves,  can  be  expected  near  and  to  the  right
of  where  the  center  makes  landfall.’’  While  exact  levels  of  the  surge  are  still  being
determined,  the  damage  from  the  surge  was  similar  to  damage  witnessed  in  Mis-
sissippi and Louisiana with Katrina.

In  the  case  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  there  have  been  news  reports  that  Max
Mayfield,  the  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  notified  FEMA  that  the
New  Orleans’  levees  would  be  breached.  In  fact,  he  did  not  say  this.  He  indicated
in his briefings to emergency managers and to the media the possibility some levees
in  the  greater  New  Orleans  area  could  be  overtopped,  depending  on  the  details  of
Katrina’s  track  and  intensity.  This  possibility  was  also  indicated  in  the  National
Hurricane Center advisory products and local weather office Hurricane Local State-
ments  and  has  been  discussed  at  conferences  and  briefings  with  emergency  man-
agers, media, and the public for many years.
Communicating Our Forecasts

The FEMA/NWS Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT), established in 1996, coordinates
communications between NOAA and the emergency management community at the
federal  and  State  levels.  Membership  consists  of  FEMA  Hurricane  Program  Man-
agers and Disaster Assistance employees as well as National Weather Service mete-
orologists  and  hydrologists.  The  Hurricane  Liaison  Team  is  activated  by  FEMA,  at
the request of the Director of the National Hurricane Center, or his or her designee.
The HLT is activated a few days in advance of any potential U.S. hurricane landfall.
Once  activated,  FEMA  hosts  the  daily  HLT  audio  or  video  conference  calls.  FEMA
invites State and local emergency managers in the potential impact area to partici-
pate in these calls. The National Hurricane Center, as an invited participant, opens
each  call  by  providing  an  updated  forecast.  After  consulting  with  our  local  weather
service offices and the National Hurricane Center, emergency managers make evac-
uation  and  other  preparedness  decisions.  The  HLT  provides  an  excellent  way  to
communicate  with  the  large  number  of  emergency  managers  typically  impacted  by
a  potential  hurricane.  This  is  a  critical  effort  to  ensure  emergency  managers  and
first responders know what to expect from the hurricane.

The  reported  evacuation  rate  during  Hurricane  Katrina  of  near  80  percent,  how-
ever, far exceeds the 25–50 percent rates usually noted. This large evacuation saved
many lives and did not happen by accident. Rather, it resulted from a long working
relationship  and  open  communication  between  NOAA,  the  emergency  management
community  at  all  levels,  and  the  media.  This  collaboration  is  especially  close  and
complementary during a hurricane threat. For example, since the 1970s, NOAA has
been delivering and updating thousands of storm surge simulations it generates for
the  entire  vulnerable  coast  from  Texas  to  Maine  long  before  any  specific  event.
These  simulations  are  the  basis  for  the  evacuation  plans  and  storm-specific  deci-
sions  made  by  the  communities  there.  In  addition,  NOAA  provides  real-time  storm
surge information.

I believe the high evacuation rate for Katrina was also due to the broad distribu-
tion  and  diverse  formats  of  National  Weather  Service  text  and  graphical  forecast
and warning products, the 471 media interviews conducted by NHC staff, the more
than  2.3  billion  ‘‘hits’’  the  National  Weather  Service  forecast  products  received  on
our  public  website,  and  the  interactions  of  local  National  Weather  Service  offices
and  the  National  Hurricane  Center  with  emergency  managers  in  the  days  prior  to
landfall.  For  Hurricane  Rita,  National  Hurricane  Center  staff  provided  935  media
interviews.  In  addition,  National  Weather  Service  web  activity,  as  supported  by
NOAA’s  web-mirroring  project,  registered  over  2.9  billion  ‘‘hits’’  during  Hurricane
Rita.

On Saturday evening, August 27, Max Mayfield personally called the Chief of Op-
erations at the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, as well as the Governors
of  Louisiana  and  Mississippi  and  the  Mayor  of  New  Orleans,  to  communicate  the
potential meteorological and storm surge impacts from Hurricane Katrina.
NOAA Aircraft Support Efforts

NOAA  Aircraft,  the  W–P3  Orions  and  the  Gulf  Stream  IV  ‘‘Hurricane  Hunters,’’
provided essential observations critical to the National Hurricane Center forecasters

and  supplement  U.S.  Air  Force  Reserve  Command’s  53rd  Weather  Reconnaissance
Squadron flights. A specialized instrument flown on one of the W–P3s, the Stepped
Frequency  Microwave  Radiometer  (SFMR),  provided  essential  hurricane  structure
and  surface  wind  data  to  hurricane  forecasters  for  both  hurricanes.  The  Military
Construction  Appropriations  and  Emergency  Hurricane  Supplemental  Appropria-
tions  Act,  2005  (P.L.  108–324)  provided  $10.5M  to  the  Air  Force  to  outfit  the  com-
plete  fleet  of  Hurricane  Hunters  with  this  instrument,  the  first  of  these  additional
units should be available during the 2006 Hurricane Season.

The  Military  Construction  Appropriations  and  Emergency  Hurricane  Supple-
mental Appropriations Act, 2005 also provided funding to NOAA for seven hurricane
buoys,  which  NOAA  deployed  this  past  year  in  the  Caribbean,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,
and the Atlantic. These new buoys provided us with critical information during this
active hurricane season.
NOAA’s  Activities  After  Hurricane  Katrina’s  and  Hurricane  Rita’s  Landfall
Immediately  following  Hurricane  Katrina’s  second  landfall,  and  also  following
Hurricane Rita’s landfall, several NOAA ships and aircraft were tasked with assist-
ing  in  the  hurricane  response.  Our  aircraft  flew  damage  assessment  flights  using
a  sophisticated  digital  camera  to  collect  imagery  to  assess  damage.  Over  10,000
high-resolution  images  were  collected  by  NOAA  aircraft  for  the  areas  impacted  by
Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita.  These  images  are  assisting  emergency  managers  and
other agencies in recovery operations and long-term restoration and rebuilding deci-
sions.  They  are  also  publicly  available  on  NOAA’s  website  to  allow  those  displaced
by the storms to view their homes and neighborhoods via the Internet.

It  is  also  NOAA’s  responsibility  to  assess  the  damage  to  the  commercial  fishing
industry  in  those  sections  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  We  are  working  closely  with  each
of  the  impacted  State  resource  agencies  and  commercial  entities  to  assess  the
storm’s impacts to the longer-term social and economic viability of local fishing com-
munities. NOAA employees also are assisting recovery efforts by working with other
federal agencies in planning, organizing, and conducting oil spill and hazardous ma-
terial response and restoration in the impacted areas of the Gulf.

NOAA vessels are tasked with surveying critical ports and waterways for depths,
wrecks and obstructions for navigational safety. NOAA Navigation Response Teams
were on the scene before both hurricanes hit to survey for hazards and help the U.S.
Coast  Guard  and  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  re-open  waterways  to  commercial
and  emergency  traffic.  Our  ships  use  highly  specialized  hydrographic  equipment  to
survey  near  shore  and  mid-water  areas  to  assess  potential  obstructions  to  naviga-
tion  caused  by  Hurricane  Katrina,  and  Rita.  The  efforts  of  these  NOAA  ships  are
critical  to  rebuilding  the  Gulf’s  economic  infrastructure  by  enabling  vessels  of  all
sizes to pass safely through these waterways thereby allowing emergency materials,
oil, and commercial goods to make it to their destinations.
Outlook for the Future

Today is October 7; to date we have had seventeen tropical storms, nine of which
have  become  hurricanes,  five  of  those  have  been  major  hurricanes  at  Category  3  or
stronger.  We  believe  we  will  continue  to  have  an  active  season,  with  a  total  of  l8–
21 tropical storms. We believe this heightened period of hurricane activity will con-
tinue  due  to  multi-decadal  variance,  as  tropical  cyclone  activity  in  the  Atlantic  is
cyclical  and  tied  to  fluctuations  in  sea  surface  temperatures  and  other  characteris-
tics  of  the  coupled  ocean-atmosphere  system.  The  1940’s  through  the  1960’s  experi-
enced an above average number of major hurricanes, while the 1970’s into the mid-
1990’s  averaged  fewer  hurricanes.  The  current  period  of  heightened  activity  could
last  another  10–20  years.  The  increased  activity  since  1995  is  due  to  natural  fluc-
tuations/cycles  of  hurricane  activity,  driven  by  the  Atlantic  Ocean  itself  along  with
the  atmosphere  above  it.  The  natural  cycles  are  quite  large  with  3–4  major  hurri-
canes a year on average during active periods and only about 1–2 major hurricanes
annually during quiet periods, with each period lasting 25–40 years.
Current and Future Research Efforts

Through  greater  understanding  of  physical  processes  and  advanced  hurricane
modeling, NOAA continually improves models for predicting hurricane intensity and
track, in collaboration with federal partners, academic researchers, and commercial
enterprises.  These  numerical  modeling  improvements,  once  demonstrated,  are
transitioned into operations.

NOAA  is  focused  on  improving  the  forecasting  of  hurricane  frequency,  track,  and
intensity  as  well  as  predicting  hurricane  impacts  on  life  and  property.  We  depend
on  numerous  critical  research  activities  inside  and  outside  NOAA.  Our  track  fore-
casts have shown continued improvement. However, we have not seen a comparable
improvement in our intensity forecasts.

From  a  scientific  standpoint,  the  gaps  in  our  capabilities  fall  into  two  broad  cat-
egories: first, our ability to measure and assess the current state of a hurricane and
its  environment  (analysis),  and  second,  our  ability  to  predict  a  hurricane’s  future
state (the forecast).

36

Many  of  the  enhancements  required  to  improve  hurricane  analyses,  particularly
over  the  data-sparse  ocean  areas,  will  be  addressed  through  such  programs  as  the
Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS),  a  10-year  international  en-
deavor  of  which  the  United  States  is  a  member  and  NOAA,  NASA,  and  USGS  are
key participants.

Using  a  combination  of  atmospheric  and  ocean  observations  from  satellites,  air-
craft, and all available surface data over the oceans, NOAA, NASA, NSF and other
federal agencies conduct experiments to better understand internal storm dynamics
and  interactions  between  a  hurricane  and  the  surrounding  atmosphere  and  ocean.
Much  of  NOAA’s  improvement  in  tropical  cyclone  forecasting  is  attributed  to  ad-
vances  in  Numerical  Weather  Prediction  (NWP).  In  collaboration  with  many  sci-
entists  and  developers  in  the  domestic  and  international  operational  NWP  centers,
the NOAA Environmental Modeling Center develops state-of-the-art numerical mod-
eling  systems.  Predicting  hurricane  intensity  remains  one  of  our  acute  challenges.
For  example,  even  though  we  knew  conditions  were  favorable  for  the  storms  to  in-
tensify, and we forecast strengthening, there was some error for both storms in the
intensity  forecast  for  the  eastern  Gulf  due  to  their  rapid  intensification.  Through
our  NWP  advancements,  our  2005  version  of  our  high-resolution  model  improved
some intensity forecasts over the statistical models when run on several 2004 Atlan-
tic  storms.  To  advance  hurricane  prediction,  especially  hurricane  intensity  and  size
forecasts,  NOAA  is  developing  the  Hurricane  Weather  and  Research  Forecasting
(HWRF)  system.  The  HWRF  system  uses  a  collaborative  approach  among  the  re-
search community and will apply advanced model physics as HWRF couples the at-
mosphere,  land,  and  ocean  into  an  integrated  model.  Our  goal  is  to  couple  an  ad-
vanced wave model with a dynamic storm surge model to better predict coastal im-
pacts of waves and storm surge.

We  have  increased  our  efforts  to  transfer  research  into  operations.  The  United
States  Weather  Research  Program  (USWRP)  Joint  Hurricane  Testbed  (JHT)  was
formed in late 2000. The mission of the JHT is to facilitate the transfer of new tech-
nology,  research  results,  and  observational  advances  of  the  USWRP,  its  sponsoring
agencies,  the  academic  community,  and  the  private  sector  for  improved  operational
tropical cyclone analysis and prediction.

While  there  are  no  quick  fixes,  we  are  very  optimistic  that  we  will  continue  to
make advances in operational forecasts of tropical cyclone intensity, wind structure,
size, and rainfall in the near future.
Conclusion

The government’s ability to observe, predict, and respond quickly to storm events
is  critical  to  public  safety.  We  must  now  look  ahead  to  post-storm  redevelopment
strategies  for  communities  impacted  by  Katrina,  Rita  and  future  storms,  to  help
manage  and  anticipate  these  extreme  events.  NOAA  has  the  expertise  in  coastal
management and hazard mitigation, and is committed to working with our partners
to  reduce  the  Nation’s  vulnerability  to  hurricanes  and  other  coastal  storm  events.
It  is  critical  that  we  work  to  protect  and  restore  natural  features  along  the  Gulf
Coast,  such  as  dunes,  wetlands,  and  other  vegetated  areas  that  offer  protection
against coastal flooding and erosion.

Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will not be the last major hurricanes to hit a vulner-
able  area,  and  New  Orleans  is  not  the  only  location  vulnerable  to  a  large  disaster
from  a  land-falling  hurricane.  Houston/Galveston,  Tampa  Bay,  southwestern  Flor-
ida,  the  Florida  Keys,  southeastern  Florida,  New  York  City/Long  Island,  and  New
England,  are  all  especially  vulnerable.  And  New  Orleans  remains  vulnerable  to  fu-
ture hurricanes.

In  partnership  with  NASA,  NSF,  and  other  agencies,  NOAA  we  will  continue  ef-
forts  to  improve  hurricane  track,  intensity,  rainfall  and  storm  surge  forecasting.
NOAA will also continue to provide technical tools and planning expertise to States
and  local  governments  to  help  mitigate  future  natural  hazards  and  provide  our  as-
sistance for response and recovery efforts.

With that, I’ll be glad to answer any questions Members may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR DAVID L. JOHNSON

David L. Johnson serves as the Assistant Administrator, National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA) for Weather Services (National Weather Service).
Johnson  heads  the  Nation’s  weather  service  and  is  responsible  for  the  day-to-day
management of NOAA’s domestic weather and hydrology operations.

Prior to joining NOAA, Johnson served as the U.S. Air Force director of weather.
He retired from the Air Force as a brigadier general, after a 30-year military career.
As Director of Weather, he was one of ten directors at the Headquarters Air Force,
Air  and  Space  Operations,  and  was  responsible  for  developing  doctrine,  policy,  re-
quirements and operational organizations to support Air Force and Army operations
worldwide. He also served as one of NOAA’s military deputies.

Notably, he organized, trained and equipped forces for the war in Afghanistan and
the war in Iraq, and managed a steady flow of accurate and focused environmental
information to battlefield commanders. He was a key advisor in the development of
the National Polar-orbiting Environmental Operational Satellite System (NPOESS).
Johnson’s career is marked by his strong management and fiscal capabilities. Dur-
ing  his  time  as  Director  of  Weather,  he  led  a  massive  re-engineering  effort  that  re-
vised  the  organizational  structure,  training  and  operations  of  the  4,000-person  ca-
reer field. Under Johnson’s steady hand, retention of weather-career airmen and of-
ficers grew to 97 percent, up from 74 percent previously.

Johnson  guided  the  planning,  programming  and  budgeting  process  implementa-
tion  at  the  highest  levels  in  the  Air  Force  and  in  the  Department  of  Defense.  He
has  a  world-wide  perspective,  having  served  in  leadership  positions  on  the  Joint
Staff with planning portfolios in Europe/NATO and Asia/Pacific. He secured funding
for  a  new  facility  for  the  Air  Force  Weather  Agency  to  house  collection,  analysis,
modeling and career-field supervision functions.

Prior  to  his  service  as  the  Director  of  Weather,  Johnson  flew  fighter,  transport
and special operations aircraft. He has over 3,800 flying hours including 78 combat
sorties. Johnson commanded airdrop and air/land operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina
and was deputy commander of the Joint Task Force for Operation Support Hope in
Rwanda. He was selected for early promotion three times.

Johnson is an honor graduate from the University of Kansas with a degree in ge-
ography, and earned his Master’s degree in human relations from Webster’s Univer-
sity.  He  is  a  graduate  of  the  National  War  College,  Maxwell  School  of  Citizenship
and  Public  Affairs  at  Syracuse  University,  and  from  the  Paul  Nitze  School  of  Ad-
vanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, General.
Mr. Mayfield.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MAX  MAYFIELD,  DIRECTOR,  NOAA  TROP-

ICAL PREDICTION CENTER/NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I
am  Max  Mayfield,  the  Director  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center
and  National  Hurricane  Center  which  is  a  part  of  the  National
Weather  Service  at  NOAA.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  here  today
to  discuss  NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service  role  in  forecasting
and warning the public about hurricanes.

The  catastrophic  devastation  along  the  Gulf  Coast  from  Hurri-
cane  Katrina  is  like  nothing  I  have  ever  witnessed.  Words  cannot
convey  the  physical  destruction  and  the  personal  suffering  in  that
part  of  our  nation.  However,  without  NOAA’s  National  Weather
Services forecasts and warnings, the loss of life could have been far
greater.

Hurricane  Katrina  began  as  a  tropical  depression  near  the
Southeast Bahamas on Tuesday, August 23rd. The National Hurri-
cane Center’s tropical cyclone forecasts were routinely issued every
six hours with intermediate updates as necessary and included text
and  graphical  products.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately
predicted  Katrina  would  become  a  Category  1  hurricane  before
making landfall near Miami.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Sorry for the interruption.
Mr. MAYFIELD. That is okay.
Chairman BOEHLERT. We are just getting these buzzers now. You
conclude  your  opening  statement  and  then  we  will  have  to  take  a
recess  and  go  to  the  Floor  and  vote  and  we  will  be  back  shortly
thereafter.

Mr. MAYFIELD. Thank you.
Once Katrina emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hur-
ricane Center forecast correctly predicted a re-intensification of the
storm. Within nine hours, Katrina intensified from a tropical storm
to  a  Category  2  hurricane.  It  later  reached  Category  5  status.  Our
forecast  track  from  Saturday  morning,  August  the  27th,  about  two
days before landfall, had the storm curving northward and heading
directly towards Southeast Louisiana and Mississippi. And the pre-
diction was for Katrina to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane.
The actual track would deviate little from this and subsequent fore-
casts for the rest of Katrina’s approach.

The intensity forecast would also prove to be very good. At 10:00
a.m.  central  daylight  time,  Saturday,  August  27th,  the  National
Hurricane  Center  posted  a  hurricane  watch  for  Southeast  Lou-
isiana,  including  the  City  of  New  Orleans.  We  issued  additional
watches and warnings for Louisiana to the Florida panhandle soon
thereafter. After reaching Southeast Louisiana, Katrina made final
landfall along the Louisiana/Mississippi border on Monday morning
as a Category 3 hurricane.

I  should  also  briefly  mention  the  tracking  forecasting  on  Hurri-
cane  Rita.  Rita  began  as  a  tropical  depression  on  Saturday,  Sep-
tember 17th over the Atlantic east of the Turks and Caicos Islands.
The  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted  the  center  of
the storm to pass just south of the Florida Keys as a hurricane on
September  20  and  predicted  it  to  become  a  major  hurricane  as  it
moved  over  the  warm  waters  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  Later,  Rita,
just like Katrina, strengthened to Category 5 status. On Thursday,
approximately  two  days  before  landfall,  the  forecast  track  was
shifted  eastward  to  just  west  of  the  Louisiana/Texas  border.  Rita’s
actual  track  would  deviate  little  from  this  and  subsequent  projec-
tions.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted  Rita
would  weaken  before  landfall  but  still  come  ashore  as  a  Category
3 hurricane.

It  is  critical  that  we  effectively  communicate  our  forecast  infor-
mation  to  everyone.  The  Hurricane  Liaison  Team  is  a  partnership
between  the  National  Weather  Service  and  FEMA.  The  team  is  a
cadre of federal, State, and local emergency managers and National
Weather  Service  meteorologists  and  hydrologists.  As  tropical  sys-
tems  threaten  the  United  States,  the  HLT  deploys  at  the  request
of  the  National  Hurricane  Center  to  assist  in  coordination  efforts.
The  team’s  mission  is  to  support  hurricane  response  operations
through the rapid exchange of critical information between the Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center  and  emergency  managers  at  all  levels.
Once  activated,  FEMA  hosts  and  facilitates  audio  and  national
video  conference  calls.  On  these  calls,  FEMA  advises  State  and
local  emergency  managers  in  the  potential  impact  area  to  partici-
pate.

The  National  Hurricane  Center  is  an  invited  participant  and
opens each call providing an updated forecast. The Hurricane Liai-
son Team provides an excellent way to communicate with the large
number  of  emergency  managers  potentially  impacted  by  an  ap-
proaching  hurricane.  After  consulting  with  our  local  weather  serv-
ice  offices  and  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  emergency  man-
agers make evacuation and other preparedness decisions.

The media is also an essential partner and helps us get the infor-
mation widely distributed to the public. The media provided an in-
valuable  service  to  the  people  of  the  impacted  Gulf  Coast  by  com-
municating National Hurricane Center forecasts and warning infor-
mation  about  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita.  In  addition,  National
Weather  Service  web  activity  as  supported  by  NOAA’s  premiering
project  registered  over  2.3  billion  hits  during  Katrina  and  2.9  bil-
lion hits during Rita.

Today is October 7, hopefully on the downside of this year’s hur-
ricane season. To date, we have had 19 tropical storms, 10 of which
have  become  hurricanes  and  five  of  those  have  been  major  hurri-
canes  of  a  Category  3  or  stronger.  This  season  has  already  been
one  of  the  most  active  on  record  and  we  still  have  another  seven
weeks to go. We believe the heightened period of hurricane activity
that  we  are  in  will  continue  due  to  multi-decadal  variations,  be-
cause  tropical  cyclone  activity  in  Atlantic  is  cyclical  and  tied  to
fluctuations  in  sea  surface  temperatures.  For  example,  the  1940’s
through  the  ’60s  experienced  an  above  average  number  of  major
hurricanes  while  the  ’70s  into  the  mid-’90s  averaged  fewer  hurri-
canes.  The  current  threat  of  heightened  activity  could  last  another
10  to  20  years.  These  natural  cycles  are  quite  large  in  amplitude
with  an  average  of  three  to  four  major  hurricanes  per  year  in  ac-
tive periods and only one to two major hurricanes annually during
the quiet periods with each period lasting 25 to 40 years.

While  we  must  focus  our  energy  on  addressing  the  impacts  of
Hurricane Katrina, we also need to look at the future. Katrina will
not be the last major hurricane to hit a vulnerable area. And New
Orleans  is  not  the  only  location  at  risk  to  a  large  disaster  from  a
hurricane.  Galveston/Houston,  Tampa  Bay,  southwestern  Florida,
the  Florida  Keys,  southeastern  Florida,  New  York  City  and  Long
Island,  and  believe  it  or  not,  New  England  are  especially  vulner-
able.  And  of  course,  New  Orleans  will  be  hit  again  by  a  hurricane
some day.

At  NOAA,  we  will  continue  our  efforts  to  improve  our  hurricane
track,  intensity,  precipitation  and  storm  surge  forecasting  and
work with our partners to ensure the best possible outcome during
future hurricane events.

With that, I will be glad to answer any questions from the Mem-

bers of the Committee.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mayfield follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MAX MAYFIELD

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  Max  Mayfield,  Director  of
the  Tropical  Prediction  Center/National  Hurricane  Center.  The  National  Hurricane
Center  is  a  part  of  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS),  of  the  National  Oceanic
and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  in  the  Department  of  Commerce.  Thank
you  for  inviting  me  here  today  to  discuss  NOAA’s  role  in  forecasting,  and  warning

the  public  about  hurricanes,  as  well  as  NOAA’s  essential  role  and  activities  fol-
lowing landfall.

The  devastation  along  the  Gulf  Coast  from  Hurricane  Katrina  is  like  nothing  I
have witnessed before. It is catastrophic. Words cannot convey the physical destruc-
tion  and  personal  suffering  in  that  part  of  our  nation.  However,  without  NOAA’s
forecasts and warnings, the devastation and loss of life would have been far greater.
NOAA’s  forecasts  and  warnings  for  Hurricane  Katrina  pushed  the  limits  of  the
state-of-the-art  of  hurricane  prediction.  Our  continuous  research  efforts  at  NOAA,
and  in  partnership  with  other  federal  agencies,  have  led  to  our  current  predictive
capabilities and improved ways of describing uncertainty in prediction. But NOAA’s
work does not end there. NOAA does extensive work assessing damage from storms
and  evaluating  waterways  to  assist  dredging  operations,  to  open  our  nation’s  ports
and waterways impacted by the storm. NOAA also assesses the impact to the areas’
fisheries,  supports  hazardous  materials  containment  and  abatement  efforts,  and
provides necessary data critical for post storm recovery operations.
Tracking and Forecasting Hurricane Katrina

The  National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  within  the  NWS  has  been  the  centerpiece
of  our  nation’s  hurricane  forecast  and  warning  program  for  50  years.  The  mission
of the NHC is to save lives, mitigate property loss, and improve economic efficiency
by issuing the best watches, warnings, and forecasts of hazardous tropical weather,
and by increasing the public’s understanding of these hazards.

NHC  tropical  cyclone  forecasts  are  issued  every  six  hours  and  include  text  mes-
sages as well as a suite of graphical products depicting our forecasts and the accom-
panying probabilities and ‘‘cone of uncertainty,’’ as it has become known. Hurricane
Katrina began as a tropical depression near the southeastern Bahamas on Tuesday,
August  23.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted  it  would  become  a
Category 1 hurricane before making landfall near Miami. The storm deluged south-
east  Florida  with  16  inches  of  rain  in  some  places,  causing  downed  trees,  flooding,
and  extended  power  outages  as  it  passed  across  the  southern  portion  of  the  state.
Once  Katrina  re-emerged  into  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  NOAA  hurricane  forecasters
correctly  predicted  re-intensification  of  the  storm.  Katrina  intensified  more  quickly
and became stronger than initially predicted. Within nine hours, Katrina intensified
from a tropical storm, with winds of 70 miles per hour, to a Category 2 storm with
100 mile per hour winds.

As  you  can  see  in  the  graphic  below,  our  forecast  track  from  Saturday  morning,
August  27,  about  two  days  before  landfall,  had  the  storm  curving  northward  and
headed  directly  toward  southeastern  Louisiana  and  Mississippi.  The  projected  path
of Katrina aimed directly at southeast Louisiana, and the prediction was for Katrina
to  make  landfall  as  a  Category  4  hurricane.  The  actual  track  would  deviate  little
from  this  and  subsequent  forecasts  for  the  rest  of  Katrina’s  approach.  On  average,
NOAA  forecasts  of  where  Katrina  would  go  were  more  accurate  than  usual,  with
all  of  the  forecast  tracks  during  the  last  48  hours  lining  up  almost  directly  on  top
of  the  actual  track.  This  forecast  beats  the  Government  Performance  and  Results
Act goal established for NOAA hurricane forecasts this year.

At 10:00 am Central Daylight Time (CDT) Saturday morning, August 27, the Na-
tional Hurricane Center posted a hurricane watch for southeast Louisiana, including
the city of New Orleans. The watch extended eastward to Mississippi and Alabama
that  afternoon.  A  hurricane  watch  means  hurricane  conditions  are  possible  in  the
specified area, usually within 36 hours. Messages from the National Hurricane Cen-
ter highlighted the potential for this storm to make landfall as a Category 4 or Cat-
egory 5 storm.

Predicting  hurricane  intensity  remains  a  challenge.  Even  though  we  knew  condi-
tions were favorable for the storm to intensify, there was some error in the intensity
forecast  for  the  eastern  Gulf  due  to  its  rapid  intensification.  While  we  accurately
predicted the intensity at landfall, there is still more work to be done in improving
intensity prediction, especially for rapidly intensifying or rapidly weakening storms.
Storm Surge

Storm  surge  has  caused  most  of  this  country’s  tropical  cyclone  fatalities,  all  too
vividly  evident  in  the  past  two  weeks,  and  still  represents  our  greatest  risk  for  a
large loss of life in this country. Following Hurricane Camille in 1969, NOAA estab-
lished a group that developed and implemented a storm surge model called SLOSH
(Sea,  Lake,  and  Overland  Surges  from  Hurricanes).  The  SLOSH  model  calculates
storm  surge  heights  resulting  either  from  historical,  hypothetical  or  actual  hurri-
canes.  SLOSH  incorporates  bathymetry  and  topography,  including  bay  and  river
configurations, roads, levees, and other physical features that can modify the storm
surge flow pattern. Comprehensive evacuation studies, conducted jointly by the Fed-
eral  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA),  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,
NOAA, and State and local emergency managers, are based on the simulated surges
computed by SLOSH.

The  National  Hurricane  Center  introduced  storm  surge  forecasts  for  the  Gulf
Coast  in  public  advisories  at  10:00  am  CDT  Saturday—32  hours  prior  to  Katrina’s
landfall  in  Louisiana.  The  initial  forecast  (10:00  am  CDT,  Saturday,  August  28)  for
storm surge was predicted at 15 to 20 feet, locally as high as 25 feet, and that fore-
cast  was  updated  the  following  morning  to  a  range  of  18  to  22  feet,  locally  as  high
as  28  feet,  when  the  forecast  intensity  for  landfall  was  increased.  ‘‘Large  and  bat-
tering’’ waves were forecast on top of the surge. In addition, the 4:00 pm CDT public
advisory  issued  by  the  National  Hurricane  Center  on  Sunday,  August  28,  stated

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

46

that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Actual storm
surge values are being determined at this time.

I  know  there  have  been  recent  news  reports  that  I  notified  FEMA  that  the  New
Orleans’  levees  would  be  breached.  In  fact,  I  did  not  say  that.  What  I  indicated  in
my briefings to emergency managers and to the media was the possibility that some
levees  in  the  greater  New  Orleans  area  could  be  overtopped,  depending  on  the  de-
tails of Katrina’s track and intensity. This possibility was also indicated in our advi-
sory products.

Communicating Our Forecasts

The FEMA/NWS Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT), which is activated at NHC a few
days  in  advance  of  any  potential  U.S.  hurricane  landfall,  coordinates  communica-
tions between NOAA and the emergency management community at the federal and
State  levels.  The  HLT  was  established  in  1996.  After  consulting  with  our  local
weather  service  offices  and  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  emergency  managers
make  evacuation  and  other  preparedness  decisions.  The  HLT  provides  an  excellent
way  to  communicate  with  the  large  number  of  emergency  managers  typically  im-
pacted  by  a  potential  hurricane.  This  is  a  critical  effort  to  ensure  emergency  man-
agers and first responders know what to expect.

The  media  is  our  most  essential  partner  and  helps  us  get  the  information  to  the
public. Without the media, it would be very difficult to get the information as widely
distributed. The media provided an invaluable service to the people of the impacted
Gulf  Coast  by  communicating  National  Hurricane  Center  forecast  and  warning  in-
formation  about  Hurricane  Katrina.  From  Thursday,  August  25,  through  Katrina’s
landfall  in  Mississippi  on  Monday,  August  29,  NOAA’s  Tropical  Prediction  Center/
National  Hurricane  Center  provided  a  total  of  471  television  and  radio  interviews,
through their media pool or via telephone.

On  Saturday  evening,  August  27,  I  personally  called  the  Chief  of  Operations  at
the  Alabama  Emergency  Management  Agency,  as  well  as  the  Governors  of  Lou-
isiana and Mississippi and the Mayor of New Orleans, to communicate the potential
meteorological  and  storm  surge  impacts  from  Hurricane  Katrina.  In  addition,  the

47

National  Hurricane  Center  web  activity,  as  supported  by  NOAA’s  web-mirroring
project, registered 900 million hits during Katrina.
NOAA Support Efforts

NOAA  is  focused  on  improving  the  forecasting  of  hurricane  frequency,  track,  and
intensity as well as predicting hurricane impacts on life and property. Using a com-
bination  of  atmospheric  and  ocean  observations  from  satellites,  aircraft,  and  all
available surface data over the oceans, NOAA conducts experiments to better under-
stand  internal  storm  dynamics  and  interactions  between  a  hurricane  and  the  sur-
rounding  atmosphere  and  ocean.  Through  greater  understanding  of  physical  proc-
esses and advanced hurricane modeling, NOAA continually improves models for pre-
dicting  hurricane  intensity  and  track,  in  collaboration  with  federal  partners,  aca-
demic researchers, and commercial enterprises. These numerical modeling improve-
ments,  once  demonstrated,  are  transitioned  into  operations  at  the  National  Hurri-
cane Center.

NOAA  Aircraft,  the  W–P3  Orions  and  the  Gulf  Stream  IV,  provided  essential  ob-
servations  critical  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center  forecasters  and  supplement
U.S. Air Force Reserve Command’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron flights.
A specialized instrument flown on one of the W–P3s, the Stepped Frequency Micro-
wave Radiometer (SFMR), provided essential hurricane structure, surface wind and
rain  rate  data  to  hurricane  forecasters  right  up  to  and  following  landfall  in  Lou-
isiana  and  Mississippi.  The  Military  Construction  Appropriations  and  Emergency
Hurricane  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act,  2005  (P.L.  108–324)  provided  $10.5M
to  the  Air  Force  to  outfit  the  complete  fleet  of  Hurricane  Hunters  with  this  instru-
ment, the first of these additional units should be available during the 2006 Hurri-
cane Season.

The  Military  Construction  Appropriations  and  Emergency  Hurricane  Supple-
mental Appropriations Act, 2005 also provided funding to NOAA for seven hurricane
buoys,  which  NOAA  deployed  this  past  year  in  the  Caribbean,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,
and the Atlantic. Those new buoys provided us with critical information during this
active hurricane season.
NOAA’s Activities After Hurricane Katrina’s Landfall

Immediately  following  Hurricane  Katrina’s  second  landfall,  several  NOAA  ships
and aircraft were tasked with assisting in the hurricane response. Our aircraft flew
damage  assessment  flights  using  a  sophisticated  digital  camera  to  collect  imagery
to assess damage. Over 5,000 high-resolution images collected by NOAA aircraft are
assisting  emergency  managers  and  other  agencies  in  recovery  operations  and  long-
term restoration and rebuilding decisions.

It  is  also  NOAA’s  responsibility  to  assess  the  damage  to  the  commercial  fishing
industry  in  that  section  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  We  are  working  closely  with  each  of
the  impacted  State  resource  agencies  and  commercial  entities  to  assess  the  storm’s
impacts  to  the  longer-term  social  and  economic  viability  of  local  fishing  commu-
nities.  NOAA  employees  also  are  assisting  recovery  efforts  by  working  with  other
federal agencies in planning, organizing, and conducting oil spill and hazardous ma-
terial response and restoration in the impacted areas of the Gulf.

NOAA  ships  are  tasked  with  surveying  critical  ports  and  waterways  for  depths,
wrecks and obstructions for navigational safety. NOAA Navigation Response Teams
were  on  scene  before  the  hurricane  hit  to  survey  for  hazards  and  help  the  U.S.
Coast  Guard  and  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  re-open  waterways  to  commercial
and  emergency  traffic.  The  THOMAS  JEFFERSON,  a  highly  specialized  hydro-
graphic survey ship equipped with multi-beam and side scan sonar and two 28-foot
launches  for  near  shore  and  mid-water  surveys  will  be  surveying  the  entrances  to
Pascagoula  and  Gulfport,  Mississippi.  Another  NOAA  ship,  the  NANCY  FOSTER,
is  outfitted  with  survey  technology  and  is  presently  conducting  wreck  and  obstruc-
tion  surveys  in  Mobile  Bay,  Alabama.  The  efforts  of  these  NOAA  ships  are  critical
to  rebuilding  the  Gulf’s  economic  infrastructure  by  enabling  vessels  of  all  sizes  to
pass safely through these waterways thereby allowing emergency materials, oil, and
commercial  goods  to  make  it  to  their  destinations.  Other  NOAA  ships  and  aircraft
are  assisting  directly  with  the  recovery  effort  by  providing  fuel,  communications,
and  supplies  to  NOAA  facilities  as  well  as  temporary  office  space  for  local  emer-
gency responders.
Outlook for the Future

Today is September 21, near the historical peak of the hurricane season. To date
we  have  had  fifteen  tropical  storms,  seven  of  which  have  become  hurricanes,  four
of  those  have  been  major  hurricanes  at  Category  3  or  stronger.  We  believe  we  will
continue to have an active season, with a total of l8–21 tropical storms. We believe
this heightened period of hurricane activity will continue due to multi-decadal vari-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

48

ance,  as  tropical  cyclone  activity  in  the  Atlantic  is  cyclical.  The  1940’s  through  the
1960’s  experienced  an  above  average  number  of  major  hurricanes,  while  the  1970’s
into the mid-1990’s averaged fewer hurricanes. The current period of heightened ac-
tivity  could  last  another  10–20  years.  The  increased  activity  since  1995  is  due  to
natural  fluctuations/cycles  of  hurricane  activity,  driven  by  the  Atlantic  Ocean  itself
along with the atmosphere above it and not enhanced substantially by global warm-
ing. The natural cycles are quite large with on average 3–4 major hurricanes a year
in  active  periods  and  only  about  1–2  major  hurricanes  annually  during  quiet  peri-
ods, with each period lasting 25–40 years.

While  we  have  made  significant  progress  in  hurricane  forecasting  and  warnings,
we  believe  we  have  more  work  to  do.  From  a  scientific  standpoint,  the  gaps  in  our
capabilities  fall  into  two  broad  categories:  first,  our  ability  to  assess  the  current
state  of  a  hurricane  and  its  environment  (analysis),  and  second,  our  ability  to  pre-
dict a hurricane’s future state (the forecast). Finally, we would like to improve pub-
lic preparedness.
Conclusion

The government’s ability to observe, predict, and respond quickly to storm events
is  critical  to  public  safety.  We  must  also  now  look  ahead  to  post-storm  redevelop-
ment  strategies  for  communities  impacted  by  Katrina  and  future  storms  to  help
manage  and  anticipate  these  extreme  events.  NOAA  has  the  expertise  in  coastal
management and hazard mitigation, and is committed to working with out partners
in reducing vulnerability to hurricanes and other coastal storm events. It is critical
that  we  work  to  protect  and  restore  natural  features  along  the  Gulf  Coast,  such  as
dunes,  wetlands,  and  other  vegetated  areas  that  offer  protection  against  coastal
flooding and erosion.

While we must focus our energy on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Katrina,
we  also  need  to  look  to  the  future.  Katrina  will  not  be  the  last  major  hurricane  to
hit a vulnerable area, and New Orleans is not the only location vulnerable to a large
disaster  from  a  land-falling  hurricane.  Houston/Galveston,  Tampa  Bay,  southwest
Florida, Florida Keys, southeast Florida, New York City/Long Island, and believe it
or  not,  New  England,  are  all  especially  vulnerable.  And  New  Orleans  remains  vul-
nerable to future hurricanes.

At  NOAA  we  will  continue  our  efforts  to  improve  hurricane  track,  intensity,  and
storm  surge  forecasting,  as  well  as  provide  technical  tools  and  planning  expertise
to states and local governments.

With that, I’ll be glad to answer any questions Members may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MAX MAYFIELD

Max  Mayfield  has  served  as  the  Director  of  NOAA’s  Tropical  Prediction  Center,
National  Hurricane  Center,  which  is  part  of  NOAA’s  National  Centers  for  Environ-
mental  Prediction/National  Weather  Service  since  2000  and  has  been  a  NOAA  em-
ployee since 1972.

Mr.  Mayfield  is  a  Fellow  of  the  American  Meteorological  Society  (AMS)  and  has
presented invited papers at several scientific meetings and lectured in several World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) sponsored training sessions, as well as provided
numerous interviews to electronic and print media.

In  1996,  he  was  awarded  the  Francis  W.  Reichelderfer  Award  from  the  AMS  for
exemplary  performance  as  coordinator  of  hurricane  preparedness  presentations  by
the National Hurricane Center to emergency preparedness officials and the general
public. He received an Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2000 National Hurri-
cane  Conference  for  the  development  of  an  innovative  approach  to  expand  the  edu-
cational  opportunities  to  State  and  local  officials  in  hurricane  preparedness,  and
was  awarded  the  Richard  Hagemeyer  Award  at  the  2004  Interdepartmental  Hurri-
cane  Conference  for  his  contributions  to  our  nation’s  Hurricane  Warning  Program.
Also  in  2004,  Mr.  Mayfield  was  presented  the  Governor’s  Award  by  the  National
Academy  of  Television  Arts  and  Sciences’  Suncoast  Chapter.  This  Emmy  Award  is
given  to  someone  who  has  made  extraordinary  contributions  to  television  and  who
is not otherwise eligible for an Emmy.

Mr.  Mayfield  has  been  recognized  by  the  Department  of  Commerce  with  Gold
Medals for his work during Hurricanes Andrew and Isabel, with a Silver Medal dur-
ing  Hurricane  Gilbert,  and  was  awarded  a  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad-
ministration  Bronze  Medal  for  the  creation  of  a  public/private  partnership  in  sup-
port of disaster preparedness for the Nation.

He  is  the  current  Chairman  of  the  WMO’s  Regional  Association—IV  Hurricane
Committee which consists of 26 members from the international community. He has
played  a  key  role  in  forecast  and  service  improvements  at  the  National  Hurricane
Center.

Mr. Mayfield is married, has three children, and resides in Miami, Florida.
Chairman. BOEHLERT. Thank you for your testimony.
We will have to recess briefly to allow Members to go to the Floor
to  vote.  We  have  two  votes  so  we  will  presumably  be  gone  15  to
20 minutes. We will reconvene as soon as the vote is over.

[Recess.]

DISCUSSION

Mr.  EHLERS.  [Presiding]  We  will  call  the  hearing  to  order.  We
thank  the  gentlemen  for  their  testimony.  We  will  begin  the  ques-
tioning  period.  Five  minutes  per  Member  for  questions  and  an-
swers. And because there are quite a number of Members here and
I know they are anxious to have their questions answered, we will
attempt  to  stick  to  the  five  minute  rule  as  much  as  possible  and
I will try to be ruthless. And the Ranking Member laughs.

LESSONS LEARNED

General  Johnson,  based  on  lessons  learned  from  Katrina  and
Rita  is  the  National  Weather  Service  going  to  change  anything
about the way you communicate forecasts and warnings to federal,
State, and local officials?

Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman.
At the end of each hurricane season, we do a pretty extensive hot

wash. We go through and review all of our procedures and——

Mr.  EHLERS.  Could  you  explain  for  the  record  what  a  hot  wash

is?

Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir. We get people who participate in commu-
nicating those threats, those warnings, those watches to the Amer-
ican public. We get media, we get emergency managers, we get peo-

ple  from  the  Hurricane  Center  all  together  and  say  how  could  we
better communicate?

I  appreciate  very  much  Mr.  Melancon’s  characterization  of  us  as
accurate and clear this year but I believe, sir, that there is always
room  for  improvement.  And  last  year,  we  had  a  pretty  unprece-
dented significant season, probably a better word, in five land fall-
ing  hurricanes.  And  at  the  end  of  last  year,  we  decided  that  we
needed  special  emphasis  on  the  communication  of  uncertainty.  I
think you remember, sir, the assertion of the skinny black line. We
wanted  to  address  uncertainty  so  we  redoubled  our  efforts  on  un-
certainty. At the end of this season, sir, we will go through and re-
view  all  of  our  procedures  and  see  if  there  is  a  better  way  to——

COMMUNICATION WITH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

OFFICIALS

Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay.  The  question  then  is,  to  my  understanding
there  is  no  mechanism  in  place  for  NOAA  and  the  Hurricane  Cen-
ter  to  confirm  that  officials  at  agencies  such  as  FEMA  and  other
State  and  local  agencies  have  received  all  the  national  and  local
hurricane forecasts issued by the Weather Service. Shouldn’t there
be  some  sort  of  confirmation  mechanism  that  you  get  affirmation
or  confirmation  from  these  folks  that  they  got  the  message,  that
they are going to act on it? Is there anything you can do along that
line?

Mr. JOHNSON. I will defer to Max on the specific operation of the
Hurricane Liaison Team. But the weather forecast offices also com-
municate with local emergency managers and we participate in for
example  the  Louisiana  Emergency  Operations  Center  and  actually
have  people  positioned  in  that  facility  to  facilitate  the  communica-
tions  of  that  environmental  information.  So  we  routinely  provide
discussion in trying to further the understanding of the message at
different intervals always at the six hour intervals when the hurri-
cane center issues.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Mr.  Mayfield,  would  you  expand  on  that?  And  also
if  it  appears  useful,  do  you  have  intermediate  reports  between  the
six hour reports? I would appreciate your comments on this.

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Right.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  takes  the
big  picture  and  we  routinely  issue  a  five-day  forecast  every  six
hours.  When  we  have  watches  and  warnings  in  effect,  we  will  go
to a two or three-hour cycle, depending on how close it is and how
well defined it is on radar. If there is something unexpected in the
track  or  intensity,  we  will  do  what  we  call  a  special  advisory  and
we did that, we certainly did that a few times on both Katrina and
Rita. So there is a continual flow of information from the hurricane
center  and  as  General  Johnson  said,  it  is  really  important,  too,  to
get  down  to  those  local  decision-makers.  And  the  local  weather
forecast  offices  do  a  tremendous  amount  of  handholding  with  the
commanders in their local area. They are under their area respon-
sibility.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Now  do  you  get  confirmation  from  everyone  that

they have received the message and the warning?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  They  are  actually  talking  to  them.  I  mean  these

are actually telephone——

Mr. EHLERS. Okay.
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  We  are  there  to  provide  the,  you  know,  the  best

back to work.

Mr. EHLERS. Do you do some sort of a role call to make sure they

are actually on the phone and listening?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  That  is  for  the  local  office,  I  am  not  sure  how
they  do  that  but  I—we  can  find  out  about  that.  But  the  National
Hurricane  Center,  we  are  indeed  an  invited  participant  on  those
Hurricane Liaison Team briefings. And FEMA headquarters, as far
as I know, they do not take an individual role call but they do take
an office role call. In other words, they will—when I come in, I will
hear them say, you know, it is the hurricane center on line, FEMA
Region 6, FEMA Region 4, Louisiana Emergency Operating Center
are you on line? So they at least do that, yes, sir.

Mr.  EHLERS.  And  when  you  come  back  two  hours  later,  do  they

report at all what they have done to——

Mr. EHLERS. All right. My time has expired.
I will turn to the Ranking Member, Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  think  with  all  the  information,  it  is  on  the  public  record  now,
it  has  become  pretty  evident  of  two  things.  One,  that  the  Weather
Service  did  an  excellent  job  in  predicting  the  hurricane  and  in  the
accuracy of doing so. I think we also know that FEMA and the Fed-
eral Government did not react well. And I am trying to find where
was that disconnect. And so, Mr. Mayfield, I am wondering wheth-
er  that  in  addition  to  the  accuracy  of  the  forecast  there  was  also
adequate information about the consequences of the hurricane. And
as  you  know,  we  have  asked  you  to  bring  your  briefing  materials
from  the  August  28  briefing  with  President  Bush  and  Secretary
Chertoff.  And  if  you  would  present  that  to  us  at  this  time,  we
would appreciate it.

Mr. MAYFIELD. I would be glad to if we can get that—okay. This
is  exactly  what—these  are  the  briefing  slides  that  I  used  on  that
Sunday,  August  the  28th  briefing,  you  know,  from  the  National
Hurricane  Center.  And  I  do  not  have  a  transcript  but  I  am  pretty
sure  I  will  be  very,  very  close  and  the  briefing  I  would  give  today
would be very close to the briefing I gave before, although probably
a little condensed version here.

That first slide, I showed just to demonstrate the—or make sure
they knew the size of the hurricane and not only is it well defined
but  it  is  not  a  small  hurricane,  it  is  a  very,  very  large  hurricane.
The next slide, please.

That was a visible picture. This one is an infrared and very, very
distinct eye. When you have that, you always have a powerful hur-
ricane  and,  in  fact,  this  was  a  Category  5  hurricane.  And  I  said
that not only is this a Category 5 hurricane like Andrew, but there
is a big, big, difference. And the difference is that it is a much larg-
er hurricane than Andrew was.

And  I  also  made  a  comparison  to  Hurricane  Lily  back  in  2002
that struck Louisiana. Lily had been a Category 4 hurricane in the
middle  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  It  weakened  down  to  a  Category  1
hurricane.  There  was  a  big  difference.  With  Lily,  we  had  a  very,
very small eye. We call it a pinhole eye. And when you have those
small eyes like that, typically they just do not persist for very long.
And  I  did  say  that  given  this  more  typical  sized  eye,  we  really  do
not expect significant weakening like Lily did. The wise thing to do
here would be to prepare for a Category 5 hurricane.

The  next  slide  is  a  water  vapor  loop  and  we  were  also  showing
animations  of  these  I  might  add  on  the  video  teleconference.  And
I  show  this  one  just  to  talk  about  the  future  motion.  There  was  a
trough  coming  in  from  the  west  that  was  eventually  going  to  turn
this  up  more  to  the  north  and  eventually  northeast.  And  the  com-
puter  models  differed  somewhat  on  when  that  turn  will  occur  and
it  makes  a  big,  big  difference  whether  it  happens,  you  know,  right
at  landfall,  or  before  landfall,  or  well  inland  there.  And  what  I
would  have  said  was  that  no  one  can  tell  you  exactly,  you  know,
where  Katrina’s  going  to  make  landfall  but  again  I  emphasized  it
was a large hurricane and wherever it made the actual landfall, it
was going to impact a very large area.

Then  the  next  slide  is—this  is  a  Hurrevac  slide  and  that  is  a
software  program  actually  developed  by  a  former  Weather  Service
employee  paid  for  by  FEMA  after  he  retired  and  this  is  a  really
nice  package  here  that  you  can  animate  this,  you  can  do  all  types
of  displays  here.  And  I  would  not  have  taken  the  time  to—I  mean
they use this—we show this at every single briefing we give but for
your  information,  that  red  area  there  that  you  see,  the  bright  red
from  Morgan  City,  Louisiana  over  to  the  Florida/Alabama  border,
that  was  where  the  coastal  hurricane  warning  was  in  place.  We
had  tropical  storm  warnings  and  hurricane  watches  on  either  side
of  that.  And  then  you  can  see  the  forecast  track  of  the  center  of
the  hurricane  and  we  always  and  General  Johnson  mentioned
there,  we  do  not  like  to  poke  attention  to  that  skinny  black  line.
We  have  that  cone  of  uncertainty  based  on  our  previous  10-year
forecast  errors  showing  where  the  center  of  the  hurricane  can  be.
And when I showed this, I said that this is not just a coastal event,
the  strong  winds,  the  heavy  rains,  the  tornadoes  will  spread  well
inland.  But—and  I  am  also  sure  that  I  said  this,  I  want  to  make
absolutely  clear  that  the  greatest  potential  for  large  loss  of  life  is
also  from  the  storm  surge.  And  that  transitions  over  to  the  next
slide.

This  is  a  storm  surge  simulation  from  the  actual  forecast  that
was  available  at  that  time.  This  went  along  with  the  11:00  a.m.
eastern daylight time advisory and this was for that noontime east-
ern  daylight  time  Hurricane  Liaison  Team  briefing.  And  I  think
you can see Lake Pontchartrain there and certainly the Mississippi
coastline  and  much  of  the  Louisiana  coastline.  The  colored  areas
are  areas  that  are  indeed  inundated  from  that  specific  forecast.
Now  again,  we  are  doing  this  every  six  hours  based  on  the  most
recent  forecast  but  the  point  here  is  that  those,  the  light  greens
and  the  yellows,  those  were  all  storm  surge  valves  of  over  20  feet.
And  I  would  have  explained  the  circulation  around  the  eye  of  the
hurricane goes counterclockwise so that means that we would have
northerly  flow  over  Lake  Pontchartrain.  And  I  did  say  that  no  one
can  tell  you  with  absolute  confidence  if  the  levees  would  be  over-
topped but it was obviously a very grave concern there. And I also
would have said that if the track had shifted a little bit to the west
or to the left there, it would have been even worse than on our cur-
rent forecast track there. I really do not want anyone to think that
we could give a perfect forecast.

And then the last two very quickly here, the storm surge in Mo-
bile.  This  showed  seven  to  eight  feet  of  surge  there.  I  was  con-
cerned that we had that much with Hurricane George in 1998 and
that  was  only  a  Category  2  hurricane.  So  I  did  not  know  for  sure

if the storm surge model really did justice to that. Wind speed also,
I  asked  that  that  be  run  a  little  further  to  the  east.  And  the  next
to  the  last  slide  there,  this  actually  shifted  the  track,  I  believe  15
to 30 miles to the east and this gave us 10 to 11 feet of storm surge
even  up  into  the  northern  portion  of  Mobile  Bay,  Dolphin  Island,
portions  of  the  Gulf  Shores.  Most  of  the  Gulf  Shores  are  under
water.  So  those  are  the  exact  slides  that  I  shared  on  that  Sunday
briefing.

This was a FEMA conference call and they invited the Hurricane
Liaison  Team  to  participate.  This  was  a  daily  call  and  it  was  held
during Katrina. Every day it was held at noon eastern time.

Mr.  GORDON.  At  noon.  And  when  did  Katrina  actually  hit  the

City of New Orleans with its maximum force?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Well  the  first  landfall  there  on  the  mouth  of  the
Mississippi  and  south  of  Buras,  Louisiana  was  about  7:10  a.m.  on
Monday  morning,  the  29th  and  then  by  the  time  it  made  the  final
landfall  near  the  Louisiana/Mississippi  border,  that  would  have
been about 10:00 or 11:00 a.m., so shortly before that.

DIRECTING HURRICANES

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay,  all  right.  Thank  you  very  much.  Mr.

Chairman, first of all let me apologize.

I  have  a  mark  up  in  another  committee,  International  Relations
Committee that I will have to attend afterwards. This has been so
enlightening  already  and  I  hate  to  miss  the  rest  of  the  questions
but let me just proceed with a few of my own.

Let me note, these photographs and the tracking that NOAA and
the  National  Weather  Service  forecasts  have  been  utilizing  are
based  on  space  based  assets  that  this  committee  has  supported
over  the  years  and  have  given  the  American  people  a  tremendous
leverage  in  terms  of  preventing  the  death  and  destruction  from
hurricanes  like  this.  And  I  want  to  pat  us  on  the  back,  Congress
on  the  back  for  actually  doing  their  job  in  terms  of  providing  this
type  of  technology  and  also  a  pat  on  the  back  for  the  National
Weather Service and NOAA for the terrific job that they did in this
and  in  other  weather  based  dangers  that  we  faced  during  my  two
decades  of  service  here  in  Congress.  You  have  always  done  a  ter-
rific job and this is yet another example.

Where  we  seem  to  have  had  a  breakdown  as  we  have  indicated
by  the  Ranking  Member’s  comments  that  there  may  have  been
some sort of breakdown somewhere on the governmental level out-
side  of  the  knowledge  base  but  in  terms  of  the  coordination  base.
I would not put that all on the Federal Government; however, I do
believe  that  the  President  by  the  time  of  this  briefing  at  noon  had
already talked to the Major of New Orleans and asked that people
be  evacuated  and  that  the  efforts  on  the  part  of  the  people  in
charge  at  that  level  of  government,  did  not  move  forward  with  the
type  of  speed  that  was  consistent  with  the  danger  that  was  being
explained.  So  although  let  us  just  say  whether  it  is  the  local  level
or the national level, there needs to be better coordination on both
sides.

And  this  is  not  towards  you  folks  but  it  just  appears  that  there
is not an emergency plan. We have got an emergency warning sys-
tem  but  we  do  not  have  an  emergency  plan  that  is  in  place  that

63

you  go  this  is  Step  1,  2,  3,  4  and  this  is  what  has  happened.  Now
much of that has to be done at the local level but the Federal Gov-
ernment  could  have  or  our  FEMA  directors  could  have  had  that
plan in place to be working with the local officials and said are you
now  on  Stage  2,  Stage  3,  Stage  4.  That  obviously  did  not  happen
especially considering the 2,000 buses that were parked in New Or-
leans rather than used for evacuation purposes.

There  has  been  a  lot  of  talk  about  whether  or  not  these  hurri-
canes  while  we  cannot,  you  know,  everybody  says  you  can  talk
about the weather, you cannot do anything about it. I have actually
seen some reports and some in Scientific American and other mag-
azines suggesting that in the future we might be able to direct the
path  of  hurricanes  and  what  do  you  guys  have  to  say  about  that?
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  You  know  that  question  has  been  around  for  a
long, long time if man can, you know, mitigate the hurricanes and
it  is  very  difficult  to  get  some  people  to  understand  both  the  size
and  the  tremendous  power  of  a  hurricane.  And  you  know,  nature
can  do  a  lot  of  things  on  its  own.  The  United  States  Government
used to have a program called Project Storm Fury where we would
see, we would fly the NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft through the
hurricane,  seed  silver  iodide  on  the  outside  of  the  eye  wall  of  the
hurricane with the intent being to weaken——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, before my time totally runs out, let me

ask you specifically.

Mr. MAYFIELD. Sure.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  We  have  already,  you  know,  seen  what
science can do to alert us and give us emergency signs of these hur-
ricanes  to  understand  they  are  coming.  Do  you  think  in  20  years
from  now  we  will  be  able  to  use  space-based  assets  perhaps  to
warm  the  water  or  cloud  seeding  to  actually  help  direct  the  path
of  a  hurricane  to  prevent  the  type  of  landfall  that  we  just  had  in
Katrina?

Mr. MAYFIELD. Well, it is great to have a vision to do something
like that but I am a very pragmatic type of guy and I am certainly
not going to hold my breath for that.

Mr. EHLERS. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Yeah, could I ask unanimous consent to have

the general answer that question for less than a minute?

Mr.  JOHNSON.  Yes,  sir.  There  is  a  massive  amount  of  energy  in
a hurricane and I think the efforts of man will be a very small in-
finitesimal amount of the——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thank you very much, General.
You now have told us that we—to alter the course of that hurri-
cane, we are going to have to all learn how to pray, I think. Thank
you very much.

Mr. JOHNSON. A higher power, yes, sir.
Mr.  EHLERS.  I  suspect  that  is  good  advice.  As  a  physicist,  I  can
tell you that you could explore 120 megaton bombs in that and the
hurricane  would  not  even  notice  it  so,  a  very  depressing  thought.
On  that  cheery  note,  we  will  turn  to  the  gentleman  from  Colo-

rado, Mr. Udall.

COMMUNICATION WITH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

OFFICIALS (CONT.)

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to also extend my gratitude to the panel for your presence

here today and your compelling and enlightening testimony.

I  intend  to  yield  to  the  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Gordon,  but  I  did
want  to  just  remind  all  the  Committee  Members  here  in  the  audi-
ence  that  in  my  district  which  includes  the  City  of  Boulder  where
we  are  fortunate  to  have  a  NOAA  facility  which  is  a  tremendous
asset.  I  cannot  think  of  a  harder  working  cohort  of  people  and  I
want  to  pay  tribute  to  them  and  the  good  work  they  do  and  the
role  they  play  in  weather  forecasting,  as  well  as,  the  climate  stud-
ies that are undertaken in Boulder.

So thanks again to the panel. With that, I would like to yield the
remaining  amount  of  my  time  to  the  gentleman  from  Tennessee,
Mr. Gordon.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Udall.
Once  again,  Mr.  Mayfield,  you  have  been  mentioned  a  variety  of
times, thank you for your service to the country, thank you for that
powerful presentation.

Let  me  ask  you,  you  told  them  to  prepare  for  a  Category  5.  Is

that correct in that presentation?
Mr. MAYFIELD. That is correct.
Mr.  GORDON.  Did  you  explain  or  did  they  understand  the  con-

sequences of a Category 5? Did you explain that to them?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Those  briefings,  Congressman,  are  not—you
know,  it  is  really  not  the  time  to,  you  know,  to  teach  a  course  in
meteorology  101  but  they,  the  folks  on  that,  the  emergency  man-
agement  folks  on  that  conference  call  certainly  should  understand
what a Category 5 hurricane can do.

Mr.  GORDON.  And  though  just  a  short  time  before  that,  through
that PAM exercise, they had a chance. It was not a five but a four
so you would know what was going on there.

So would you tell us, then, would you describe what are the con-

sequences to that region for a Category 5?

Mr. MAYFIELD. Well you have to deal with all the hazards of the
hurricane.  The  first  is  the  storm  surge.  It  is  a  dome  of  water  that
comes in near to where the center makes landfall. Very unique set
of circumstances there in Louisiana that it is just so low lying and
of  course  the  city  itself  being  like  a  bowl  and  much  of  the  city
below sea level. That has always been a concern with a storm surge
in that area.

Number two, of course, are the strong winds and the winds were,
you  know,  a  Category  4  or  5  hurricane  can  do  tremendous  wind
damage.  And  we  have  also  learned  over  the  years  that  the  winds
are stronger aloft. We put a statement in our advisories on Sunday
saying  that  being  that  the  windows  could  be  blown  out  in,  you
know, high rise structures. Then you have to worry about the rain-
fall.  And  this  is  a  team  effort.  We  have  the  rainfall  experts  within
NOAA,  the  Hydro  Meteorological  Prediction  Center.  And  I  did  not
mention this earlier but they actually were on those Hurricane Li-
aison Team briefings with us every day. I would do the basic mete-
orology and then they would chime in on the rainfall forecast. And

65

then,  of  course,  the  fourth  main  hazard  would  be  the  tornadoes
that can spread well inland and can be well removed from the eye
of the hurricane.

Mr. GORDON. Thank you, sir.
As I quoted earlier, Michael Brown said, ‘‘I must say, this storm
is  much  bigger  than  anyone  expected.’’  Was  it  bigger  than  you  ex-
pected and bigger than you predicted?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  We  briefed  routinely  and  then  in  every  advisory
we  issued,  we  would  give  the  size.  Are  we,  you  know,  differen-
tiating  between  the  size  of  the  hurricane  and  the  intensity?  There
is a difference. You can have a large powerful hurricane or a large
weak  hurricane  or  a  small  powerful  hurricane  or  small,  you  know,
weak hurricane so those are two different things. I am not sure ex-
actly  what  Mike  Brown  meant  by  that  if  he—I  suspect  he  meant
it was, you know, an extreme event. I am not sure he really meant
large  in  terms  of  size,  but  that  I  will  think  you  will  have  to  ask
him what he actually meant from that.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Udall.
Mr. BONNER. [Presiding] I believe the Chair controls the time but
the gentleman from Minnesota has another appointment so I would
now recognize Mr. Gutknecht.

HURRICANE MULTI-DECADAL CYCLE

Mr. GUTKNECHT. I thank the Chair.
Mr.  Mayfield,  I  would  like  to  switch  gears  for  just  a  minute  be-
cause  we  have  heard  from  some  other  experts  and  I  would  like  to
hear  it  right  from  the  top  guns  here.  That  we  may  expect  more
hurricanes this year and we are in a hurricane cycle where we may
see  more.  First,  a  simple  question,  how  many  more  hurricanes
should we expect this year?

Mr. MAYFIELD. I wish I could tell you for sure about that. I can-
not  be  exact.  Our  seasonal  forecasters  were  calling  even  back  in
early  August  18  to  21  named  storms,  we  have  already  had  19.  We
were  calling  for  nine  to  11  hurricanes  and  we  have  had  ten.  And
we were calling for five to seven major hurricanes and we have had
five.  I  think  the  best  way  I  could  answer  that,  if  you  go  back  the
last  40  years  or  so,  we  typically  averaged  two  or  three  named
storms  in  October  and  November.  I  would  like  to  say  we  could
count  Stan  and  Tammy  on  that  but  I  really  do  not  think  we  can.
I think a reasonable expectation would be for another two to three
named  storms.  One  or  two  of  those  might  be  hurricanes.  I  think
one  of  the  important  things  is  that  and  I  just  checked  on  this.  If
you  go  back  to  1995  when  this  active  period  began,  we  have  had
eight  major  hurricanes  in  the  month  of  October,  two  major  hurri-
canes  in  the  month  of  November  so  we  are  averaging,  you  know,
one major hurricane per year in October and November in this ac-
tive period.

Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  Now  you  have  just  touched  on  this  and  I  am
sorry, I had an agricultural hearing and a markup and some of us
are in and out and that does not mean that it is not important, but
can you talk a little bit about those cycles? I mean, we hear about
that on the news. Where do you think we are in the cycle and how
long will it last?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Well  we  have  got  some  not  very  good  news  here.
These  cycles,  you  know,  will  go  10  to  30  or  40  years  and  you  can
go  well  back  in  the  record  books  here  to  look  at  these  cycles.  And
if, for example, the ’50s and ’60s indeed were very, very active with
a  lot  of  major  hurricanes.  And  we  need  to  remember  that  most  of
the  loss  of  life  and  most  of  the  damage  occurs  from  these  major
hurricanes, Categories 3, 4, and 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane
Scale. Then in 1995, somebody seems to have thrown a switch here
and it has really gotten active. We have had a tremendous number
of major hurricanes. And the research meteorologists unfortunately
are  telling  us  that  this  active  period  will  very  likely  last  another
10 or 20 years or more.

Mr. GUTKNECHT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. BONNER. Thank you.
The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman  from  North  Carolina,  Mr.

Miller.

FUNDING FOR HURRICANE RESEARCH

Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I agree with Mr. Gordon that certainly NOAA’s performance was

probably the best one we had in the Federal Government.

General Johnson, when you count your life’s blessings, count the
fact  that  there  was  never  a  moment  on  National  television  that
President Bush said to you, Johnny, you are doing a heck of a job.
You  all  certainly  did  a  much  better  job  than  other  agencies  of  the
Federal Government. But I am very concerned about our continued
ability  to  do  a  good  job  and  to  do  a  better  job.  And  certainly  there
seems  to  be  room  for  improvements  in  the  technology,  in  the
science  forecasting  even  if  we  do  not  look  to  that  millennial  day
when we can actually control hurricanes, we certainly could do bet-
ter  in  forecasting  their  exact  path,  their  intensity,  their  rainfall,
the inland flooding that they cause.

General Johnson, the difference between the House and the Sen-
ate  budget  for  NOAA  is  $1  billion.  What  would  the  House  budget
due  to  NOAA’s  ability  to  improve  upon  the  science  or  even  main-
tain what you have, to maintain or improve the buoy system, to im-
prove  upon  science?  I  understand  that  the  scientists  at  NC  State
by  the  way  did  a  better  job  of  forecasting  the  path  and  intensity
of  the  storm  because  they  are  using  more  advanced  methodology.
General  Johnson,  what  would  that  budget  difference  due  to
NOAA’s ability to improve or even keep what you got?

Mr.  JOHNSON.  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  look  at  the  House

mark and the Senate mark at a very conceptual level.

Mr.  MILLER.  I  sort  of  thought  that  would  get  your  attention,

yeah.

Mr.  JOHNSON.  Yes,  sir.  There  is  a  significant  different  there  and
we  are  anxiously  awaiting  the  conference  and  what  really  comes
out of that. There is always an opportunity to do better and to im-
prove.  And  I  think  in  my  opening  statement,  we  talked  about  ob-
servations,  opportunities  in  modeling,  and  my  written  statement  I
highlight some of those as well.

how  we  can  continue  to  serve  the  American  public  with  accurate
and timely advise and forecasts like we have been.

Mr. MILLER. What are your feelings, Mr. Mayfield?
Mr. MAYFIELD. If I could just say one thing and I need to say this
very carefully for the folks who were impacted. In both Katrina and
Rita,  to  some  extent,  we  were  fortunate  because  they  were  both
major  hurricanes,  in  fact,  Category  5  hurricanes  well  before  they
made  landfall.  You  know,  if  you  look  at  all  the  storms  and  hurri-
canes that hit the United States, only about 20 percent of them are
major  hurricanes,  Category  3,  4,  and  5,  yet  that  20  percent  causes
over  80  percent  of  the  damage.  Most  major  hurricanes  become
major hurricanes by going through some rapid intensification cycle
that  we  simply  do  not  understand  yet.  And  both  Katrina  and  Rita
did this rapid intensification fortunately well, you know, away from
that landfall point. If that rapid intensification had happened right
at the time of landfall, in other words, people are going to bed pre-
paring for let us say a Category 1 or 2 hurricane and then if they,
you  know,  awaken  to  a  Cat  4,  I  would  not  be  sitting  here  today  I
suspect.

Anyway,  we  do  need  help  especially  with  that  rapid  intensifica-

tion.

LOCAL FORECASTS

Mr.  MILLER.  You  would  be  testifying  before  the  Government  Re-

form Committee rather than the Science Committee.

Mr.  Mayfield,  in  my  state,  you  said  someone  threw  a  switch  in
1995.  My  district,  not  just  my  state,  but  my  district  and,  in  fact,
my house has been affected by Fran and Floyd. And the great bulk
of  the  damage  has  been  inland  flooding,  tornadoes.  It  has  been  a
local forecast that would be most helpful in preparations and in re-
sponse.  How  important  or  what  is  the  current  status  of  our  ability
to  do  local  forecast  and  how  will  the  proposal  to  cut  the  number
of  the  local  offices  from  I  think  122  to  maybe  20  or  30,  how  will
that affect your ability to do the local forecasting?

Mr. JOHNSON. Let me take that one.
Mr. MILLER. Okay.
Mr.  JOHNSON.  We  are  constantly  looking  at  opportunities  to  im-
prove  the  way  we  provide  products  and  services.  And  one  of  the
things  that  I  am  looking  at  is  our  concept  of  operations.  We  have
122 weather forecast offices and 13 river forecast centers that pro-
vide  services  for  America.  I  am  looking  at  economies  and  effi-
ciencies  in  how  can  we  best  provide  those  products  and  services.
There  is  no  proposal  to  cut  the  number  of  offices  at  this  time.  We
are  looking  at  how  we  can  use  the  resources  we  have  and  be  good
stewards of the taxpayers dollars. So there is no proposal out there
to cut numbers of offices.

EVACUATION DECISION

Mr. BONNER. The gentleman’s time has expired.
I  will  reclaim  my  time  and  I  want  to  express  as  others  have.  I
would be remiss if I did not. As someone who lives in Mobile, Ala-
bama  and  since  last  September  with  Hurricane  Ivan,  has  experi-
enced the good fortune of relying on both of you two gentlemen and

the  many  men  and  women  who  work  with  you,  our  thanks  for  the
great job you all do and for the service you render our entire coun-
try  in  terms  of  giving  us  adequate  warning  that  a  storm  is  immi-
nent.

I  would  like  to  go  back  to  a  question  I  think  Mr.  Gordon  raised,
but  others  have  as  well,  and  that  deals  with  the  issue  of  shelters.
Because  we  experienced  during  Hurricane  Ivan  and  we  certainly
did during Hurricane Dennis where the Governor of our State, Bob
Riley  ordered  a  mandatory  evacuation  of  Mobile  County,  Alabama
and  the  coastal  area  of  Baldwin  County  and  turned  both  lanes  of
I–65 northbound, the first time we had done that. It was successful
in  terms  of  evacuating  a  lot  of  people.  Fortunately  for  us  in  Ala-
bama, Dennis veered a little bit to the right, unfortunately for our
friends  in  Florida,  but  as  a  result,  we  had  a  good  lesson  on  evacu-
ation.

But  General  Johnson,  Mr.  Mayfield,  is  there  ever  a  time  when
a community, a state, or the Federal Government should encourage
people to stay in an area when a Category 4 or a Category 5 storm
is  coming.  Using  New  Orleans  as  an  example,  should  any  official
of  government  have  recommended  that  people  stay  in  a  city  with
a Hurricane 4 or a Hurricane 5 coming into that city?

Mr. JOHNSON. The role of the National Weather Service is to pro-
vide that accurate timely and focused information. We refer to our
colleagues over in Emergency Management side on evacuation deci-
sions  and  whether  they  should  shelter  in  place.  We  do  work  with
them in the off season to see how much time would be required and
available.  That  is  part  of  the  hot  wash  at  the  end  because  evacu-
ations  from  certain  areas  take  much  longer  than  others  depending
on the infrastructure but I would defer to them.

Mr. MAYFIELD. And that doesn’t mean we do not care about those
things.  I  mean  it  is  a  real  team  effort,  the  Nation’s  Hurricane
Warning  Program,  you  know,  it  consists  of  the  forecasters,  the
emergency  management,  the  community,  and  the  media.  The
media  is  a  big  part  of  this.  And  we  certainly  care  about  that  and
our  message  has  been  so  consistent  in  urging  every  individual,
every family, every business, and every community to develop that
hurricane plan and know what to do. But as General Johnson said,
the  roles  are  defined.  And  our  role  is  to  provide  the  best  forecast
that we possibly can.

Mr. BONNER. But even with your role, you still have a wealth of
knowledge. Mr. Mayfield if you had been in New Orleans watching
TV,  the  reports  that  your  office  and  that  you  in  fact  were  the  one
that  was  on  national  TV  recommending,  would  you  have  stayed  in
that city?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I  think  that  I  would  hope  that  the  mayors  and
the  governors  were  not  telling  me  how  to  forecast  and  I  am  sure
they would appreciate me not telling them how to evacuate.

Mr. BONNER. The next question goes to the gentlelady from Cali-

fornia, Ms. Woolsey.

HURRICANE LIAISON TEAM

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you very much.
First  of  all,  congratulations  for  both  of  your  agencies  for  pro-
viding—using  federal  funds.  And  we  have  to  take  credit  for  that.

We invested in the right thing so that you had weather service. In-
formation  that  was  timely,  accurate,  and  focused.  And  thank  you,
thank  you.  It  proves,  I  believe,  that  we  can  achieve  our  goals.
When there is a will, there is a way. And now I think we have the
opportunity  to  know  how  your  good  information  was  used.  So  I
have a couple questions about that.

Mr. Mayfield, I know you do not keep a log of who is on the daily
Hurricane Liaison Team, the HLT, on the calls, but would you say
there is good participation or there was by the State and local folks
on these calls in general? Could you tell? Did you know?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I  am  not  sure  if  you  were  in  here,  Congress-
woman,  but  as  far  as  I  know,  FEMA  does  not  take,  you  know,  an
individual  role  call  but  they  do  and  I  mean  I  am  talking  about
these daily video teleconferences now. I mean, there is a lot of addi-
tional coordination. But they do have a role call of offices. In other
words,  they  would  come  and  ask,  ‘‘hurricane  center,  are  you  on
line?  FEMA  Region  6,  are  you  on  line?  Mississippi  EOC,  are  you
on  line?’’  They  would  do  that  so  that  information  I  would  think
would be available from FEMA. I did not take role though.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Okay.  Well,  we  have  used  this  process  for  a  long
time  now  and  you  know  so  much  more  know  than  we  ever  knew,
you  know,  in  previous—in  years  passed.  So  would  you  say  this
process  has  provided  a  good  forum  of  information  or  an  exchange
between  the  various  levels  of  government  or  is  there  a  way  that
you  would  suggest  changing  the  process  based  on  the  post  hurri-
cane season and get local government more involved?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Congresswoman,  you  know  if  there  is  anything
that  we  could  have  done  differently  or  better  on  our  end,  I  assure
you  that  I  want  to  know  exactly  what  that  is.  I  can  tell  you  that
FEMA  sponsored  a  briefing,  the  noontime  video  teleconference  in-
volving the Hurricane Liaison Team. That was done the same way
in  Hurricane  Katrina  that  it  was  done  in  all  the  hurricanes,  all
four of those hurricanes that hit Florida last year, and done exactly
the  same  way  with  Hurricane  Rita.  That  process  did  not  change.
Ms.  WOOLSEY.  But  should  it  go  lower  to  get  the  local  folks  more

involved?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Oh,  you  are  asking  should  the  local  folks  be  on

that video teleconference?

I have absolutely no objection to that. If I could give you my own
opinion on that, this is a big picture of sort of the real big picture,
the  overview.  The  locals,  I  think  are  best  served  by  that
handholding  going  on  in  their  local  community  by  the  local  Na-
tional Weather Service offices. Right before every forecast is issued
from  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  we  have  a  hurricane  hot  line
call  with  all  of  our  potential  impacted  local  Weather  Service  fore-
cast offices, the river forecast centers, the rainfall forecasters of the
Hydro  Meteorological  Prediction  Center,  the  tornado  forecasters
and the Storm Prediction Center. The Department of Defense is on-
line.  They  would  be  Norfolk,  Jacksonville,  Pensacola,  and  others.
NASA  is  on  that  line.  So  we  do  a  tremendous  amount  of  coordina-
tion.  And  those  local  forecasters,  you  know,  in  the  local  commu-
nities,  they  know  everything  we  do  right  before  the  advisory  goes
out.  And  then  they  turn  around  and  do  that  handholding  with  the
local emergency management and other officials. And I know these

folks in Slidell and in Mobile and I have known them for years and
I know that they did their job. If there is something else that could
have been done, I am sure they will want to know that too.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT

Mr. EHLERS. [Presiding] The gentlewoman’s time has expired.
General  Johnson,  were  any  of  your  vital  facilities  or  equipment
damaged or destroyed in Katrina and Rita? If so, what is the status
of  those  facilities  today  and  what  are  you  doing  to  maintain  capa-
bilities in the short-term?

Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, sir. We had some significant damage to facili-
ties.  We  had  a  back  up  plan  in  place  so  that  when  we  lost  power
in  the  Slidell  office  for  example,  the  Mobile  office  picked  up  those
requirements. I was down there yesterday, Mr. Chairman, checking
out how operations were going and there is some roof damage and
some other things that we need to address. I know we lost services
of  a  couple  of  buoys,  some  NOAA  weather  radios,  those  kinds  of
things, sir, and we are in the process of assessing those right now.
Mr. EHLERS. Do you have the resources to do—to make these re-
pairs and get back on line during the rest of the hurricane season?
Mr.  JOHNSON.  Sir,  with  the  start  of  the  fiscal  year  and  a  con-
tinuing resolution I am going through an assessment right now and
we are looking forward to the ’06 ability to get an infusion of funds
to address those.

Mr. EHLERS. All right.

LONG-TERM OUTLOOK

Mr.  Mayfield,  I  am  interested  in  a  little  futurism  here.  What  is
the future outlook with respect to both hurricane frequency and in-
tensity  during  the  next  50  to  100  years?  Do  you  have  any—and  I
know that is very long-term but what factors contribute to the fre-
quency  and  intensity  and  what  do  you  see  developing  that  could
have an impact on both frequency and intensity?

Mr. MAYFIELD. Well, I would like to jump right to the bottom line
but  I  will  hold  that  for  a  little  bit.  One  of  the  biggest  correlations
that we have with hurricane activity in the Atlantic is the sea sur-
face  temperatures.  And  just  as  the  sea  surface  temperatures  have
cycles  of  warm  and  cold,  warm  and  cold,  so  does  the  hurricane  ac-
tivity  so  I  cannot  tell  you  with  any  certainty  what  the  future  will
hold  other  than  these  cycles  will  very,  very  likely  continue.  Ten  to
40  year  cycles  are  active  and  then,  you  know,  followed  by  inactive
periods there.

But this is important, too. We need to remember that you do not
have to be in an active period to have that one powerful hurricane.
And 1992 was well below the average number of storms and hurri-
canes.  This  was  not  in  a  warm  period,  it  was—we  only  had  six
storms  that  year,  only  four  of  those  were  hurricanes,  but  yet  we
had that one little hurricane called Andrew. So no matter what pe-
riod we are in, active or inactive, the bottom line from my perspec-
tive  is  that  we  need  to  be  prepared.  We  need  to  have  those  hurri-
cane  plans  in  place.  And  everyone  down  to  that  individual  taking

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

71

that  personal  responsibility  needs  to  know  what  to  do  before  the
next one comes.

Mr. EHLERS. So in other words, the frequency follows certain cy-
cles  but  there  is  no  relationship  between  intensity  and  frequency?
Mr. MAYFIELD. No, there is, I am sorry, sir. I did not understand
that.  Yeah,  in  the  active  periods,  we  do  tend  to  have  more  major
hurricanes  so  that  obviously  is  a  concern.  I  was  just  trying  to  say
that even in the inactive periods you can still have that——

Mr.  EHLERS.  Right,  okay.  But  there  is  some  correlation  between

frequency and intensity. Okay.

And  much  of  it  is  related  then  to  the  cycling  of  the  surface  tem-
peratures  in  the  gulf  and  in  the  western  Atlantic.  Is  that  correct?
Mr. MAYFIELD. Right. We typically look at our main development
region, the tropical Atlantic, the Caribbean and part of the Gulf of
Mexico.

You  know,  you  can  correlate  a  lot  of  different  things  with,  you
know,  the  activity  and  that  sea  surface  temperature  is  one  of  the
best things that we have.

Mr. EHLERS. Well at least you have not tried to correlate it with
full moons which seemed to be the favorite thing people like to cor-
relate things with.

My time has expired. We recognize the gentlewoman from Texas,

Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee.

TIMELINE

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Let  me  thank  the  Chairman  and  the  Ranking  Member  for  what
I  think  is  both  a  vital  and  timely  hearing,  and  allow  me  to  thank
both  General  Johnson  and  Mr.  Mayfield  for,  I  know  a  grateful
America for the existence of NOAA but also its technology. For that
reason, allow me for a line of questioning that again may take you
over  the  timeline  that  I  view  is  so  very  crucial  to  the  component
of saving lives.

Backtrack for me again if you would, the time that you began to
assess Hurricane Katrina. And I may interrupt you and forgive me
only  because  I  have  a  series  of  questions  and  I  know  my  time  is
short.  So  when  I  look  at  sort  of  the  end  of  August,  how  far  back
did you begin tracking Hurricane Katrina?

Mr. MAYFIELD. Well we were tracking the disturbances, the trop-
ical waves come off the coast of Africa every three or four days just
like clockwork all through the hurricane season and we were track-
ing a tropical wave that really did not form. It became a depression
on Tuesday, the 23rd of August. I asked for activation of the Hurri-
cane  Liaison  Team  to  start  on  the  24th.  It  was  activated  at  7:00
a.m.  on  Wednesday,  the  24th,  became  a  storm  on  the  24th,  and
then it became a hurricane just before it made landfall on the 25th
near Miami.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. And it was what category at that point?
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  A  Category  1  hurricane  when  it  made  landfall
there.  And  it  became  at  Cat  1  just  an  hour  or  two  before  landfall.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. A measure or two.
At that time, were you on any kind of large conference calls with
all necessary parties including the President or his representatives
starting at that point?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

72

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I  honestly  do  not  remember  when  the  President
was on it except I know for a fact that he was on that Sunday, Au-
gust  the  28th  as  it  was  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  I  do  not  remember
and quite honestly some time ago on the video teleconference mon-
itor will have nine or more little pictures there and it may say the
White House or it may say, you know, Louisiana Emergency Oper-
ations  Center  and  I  really  cannot  see  exactly  who  is  there  in  each
of  those  offices.  But  the  video—well  on  Wednesday  the  24th,  we
had  a  telephone  conference  call  with  FEMA  and  by  the  time  it  hit
Florida  there  on  the  25th,  we  had  the  video  teleconferences  going
daily at noontime. And I am sorry but I cannot tell you exactly, you
know, which individuals were on there.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  But  you  know  that  he  was  on  on  the  28th,

which was that Sunday?

Mr. MAYFIELD. That is correct.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. And were local officials on as well?
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  The  local  officials  were  not  on  but  the  States,
Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia emer-
gency  operation  centers  were  on  that  big  picture.  Again,  that  the
big  picture  called  there  on  that  video  teleconference.  Of  course
FEMA  headquarters  facilitated  the  call  and  then  FEMA  Region  4
out  of  Atlanta,  Georgia  and  FEMA  Region  6  out  of  Denton,  Texas.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  How  much  guidance  do  you  give  as  you  are
providing the science of these Cats 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 5? How much
direction  can  you  give  to  FEMA  or  how  much  direction  are  they
seeking  from  you  as  partly  the  agency  dealing  with  natural  disas-
ters,  the  National  FEMA  as  opposed  to  State  emergency  agencies?
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Well,  a  fair  question  but  the  roles  are  defined
here  and  our  role  is  to  provide  the  best  forecast  that  we  can.  So
we  would  be  reporting,  I  would  be  briefing  on,  you  know,  the  cur-
rent location and strength of the hurricane, the future track of the
hurricane,  the  future  intensity  forecast,  the  potential  storm  surge,
rainfall, tornado activity. Our role is to provide the best, you know,
weather information that we possibly can.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  But  at  some  point,  the  human  factor  must
play  in  where  somebody  takes  a  deep  breath  to  say  guys  this  is  a
Cat  5,  we  have  got  to  move.  I  am  sure  sometimes  in  the  course  of
conversation that happens. Is that correct?

Mr. MAYFIELD. Well, we certainly said that this was a Cat 5, you
know,  when  it  became  a  Cat  5  and  I  did,  I  mean,  I  firmly  believe
that people understood the potential that this hurricane held.

Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  General,  let  me  ask  you  this.  With  the  work
that you have done, my understanding is that there is a difference
of  $1  billion  between  the  Senate’s  mark  and  the  House  mark  as  it
relates  to  NOAA.  This  Committee  has  always  been  a  strong  advo-
cate  of  funding  for  NOAA  but  it  baffles  me  as  to  what  you  will  do
with that shortfall.

And  then  let  me  raise  this  with  you.  Clearly  as  Mr.  Mayfield,
said  there  is  a  point  where  there  is  an  exasperation  or  an  exas-
perated voice saying, you know, this is a Cat 5 and you are speak-
ing  to  I  call  it  level  folk  that  are  at  the  level  of  State  government
but  the  Federal  Government  is  there.  Do  we  need  to  legislate,  if
you  will,  a  stronger  role  for  NOAA  as  it  relates  to  the  interaction
between agencies like FEMA because we all know that despite the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

73

local  responsibility  and  the  state  in  natural  disasters  when  NOAA
is on the line saying with its refined science there is a Cat 5, some-
body  at  the  top  level  should  act.  In  the  case  of  Hurricane  Katrina,
it is well known that they did not act. Do we need to provide some
greater  cohesion  so  that  the  Federal  Government  can  be  working
more  effectively  together  and  get  people  out  and  save  lives.  But  I
ask that question in the cut in your seemingly proposed cut in the
dollars that are going to you this time around.

Mr.  EHLERS.  The  gentlewoman’s  time  has  expired.  Please  give  a

brief answer.

Mr. JOHNSON. Ma’am, we are an important part of the team and
weather service characterizes the storm and provides that accurate
timely  information.  We  also  pay  very  much  attention  to  the  Na-
tional Hurricane Center that takes that very big picture and takes
the  larger  view.  The  local  weather  forecast  offices  translate  that
view into specific local topography, bathymetry, and specific events.
You know, characterizing, you know, where the effects are going to
be  held.  We  also  in  the  messages  that  we  put  out  through  NOAA
weather  radio  and  all  of  our  communication  techniques  and  capa-
bilities,  emphasize  paying  attention  to  your  local  emergency  man-
ager because they are an important part of the team as well.

Right now, I am hopeful that the Conference Committee will find
a good accommodation and take care of the requirements for NOAA
and the Weather Service and allow us to continue to do the job that
we are capable of doing.

FIVE-DAY FORECASTS

Mr. EHLERS. The gentlewoman’s time has expired.
Question  for  either  one  of  you,  you  can  decide  who  is  to  answer.
But  you  have  introduced  a  five-day  hurricane  track  prediction,
where  as  I  recall  last  year  you  were  doing  three-day.  What  has
your  experience  been  so  far  and  I  am  curious  why  do  you  believe
the  data  has  improved  sufficiently  you  can  now  give  accurate  five-
day reports and do you plan to continue to do that or have you dis-
covered some weaknesses?

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Mr.  Chairman,  we  really  do  listen  to  our  users.
You  know,  most  coastal  states  now  have  a  yearly  hurricane  con-
ference.  We  have  a  national  hurricane  conference,  we  have  inter-
departmental  hurricane  conference.  There  are  a  lot  of  venues  that
allow customers to, you know, share with us what they would like.
And that five-day went well into effect here in 2003, I believe after
a  couple  of  years  of  testing.  And  that  was  actually  stated  as  a  re-
quirement  by  the  United  States  Navy.  And,  you  know,  we  cannot
produce  a  product  with  taxpayer  money  and  just  give  it  to  a  few
chosen  people.  With  the  public/private  partnership  we  have  when
we  create  our  product,  we  make  that  available  to,  you  know,  any-
one and everyone.

The feedback that I have gotten on the five-day has been on the
most  part  very  positive  though  the  truth  is  a  five-day  forecast  is
as  accurate  as  the  three-day  forecast  was  just  15  or  so  years  ago.
We  put  out  on  our  graphical  products  a  cone.  That  cone  at  the  ex-
tended periods of four and five days is very, very large because we
have these large areas. But for most people, for the public, the only
thing  I  ask  is  that  if  you  are  within  that  large  cone  at  those  ex-

tended  time  periods,  just  start  thinking  about  what  you  might  do
if  the  hurricane  continued  to  head  toward  your  community.  Most
people do not need that four- and five-day lead time there but there
are  some  users,  NASA  if  the  Space  Shuttle  is  on  the  launch  pad
or  the  Navy  with  all  their  aircraft  carriers  in  Norfolk  for  example
and  they  have  to  get  people  back  from  shore  leave  and  get  the
ships  ready  and  underway  and  away  from  the  coast  before  the  ar-
rival,  you  know,  of  high  seas  and  storm  force  winds.  So  there  are
some  customers  who  indeed  make  very  good  use  of  that  four-  and
five-day forecast.

REBUILDING NEW ORLEANS

Mr.  EHLERS.  And  may  I  ask  both  of  you,  do  you  have  any  in-
volvement  in  the  rebuilding  of  New  Orleans?  Are  you  making  any
recommendations? What is your relationship with the local officials
on that?

Mr.  JOHNSON.  Sir,  NOAA  is  actively  involved  in  restoration,
clearing  the  shipping  channels  to  allow  the  port  to  reopen,  looking
at the ecosystems and what needs to be done to restore those. Your
weather  service  continues  to  provide  information  on  post-Katrina,
the Rita impacts, as well as, the daily forecast to all the people who
are  down  there  working.  And  sir,  they  are  paying  attention  to  the
forecast. So, yes, sir, we are actively involved at all levels of NOAA.
Mr. EHLERS. It would be nice also if you could persuade them not
to rebuild in areas below sea level but I will leave that to your dis-
cretion.

My time has nearly expired. Mr. Davis?
Mr.  DAVIS.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much  for  recognizing

me. I will not make a large speech.

But  I  think  as  we  observed  what  happened  with  the  hurricane
that  came  through  the  gulf,  perhaps  tells  all  of  us  in  Congress,  as
well  as,  those  who  live  in  the  area  and  certainly  NOAA  that  we
need to make a serious visit to the predictions. Obviously, the abil-
ity  that  you  have  and  a  way  to  protect  those  who  live  in  an  area
where  the  hurricanes  often  frequent  in  the  gulf  or  other  areas  in
Florida.

I  represent  an  area  that  is  in  Tennessee.  Obviously,  we  get  a
goodness  many  times  from  the  hurricanes  because  we  get  rainfall
that comes in that helps our farmers have the rainfall that is need-
ed.  But  also  coming  with  those  many  times  are  tornadoes  that  are
spawned  from  the  high  winds  and  as  a  result  of  that,  we  have
small  footprint  of  damage  and  destruction  that  was  observed  in  a
large  footprint  across  the  gulf—down  the  road  would  be  the  wooly
warm  would  be  dark  on  one  or  the  other  or  all  the  way  through
would  mean  a  rough  winter.  The  thickness  on  the  bark  of  a  tree
or where a wasp or a hornet would hang their nest, how low in the
trees it would be.

Obviously,  we  have  greatly  expanded  and  improved  upon  pre-
dicting the weather and how forceful, how almighty it can be, how
damaging, and how harmful it can be. And it is my hope that those
of  us  who  serve  in  Congress  realize  that  continued  funding  for  the
predictability  of  weather  that  will  save  lives  is  certainly  a  home-
land  security  issue  to  us.  I  do  believe  that  people  throughout  this
nation  today  have  had  a  taste  of  the  damage  of  the  hurricane  for

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

75

a  reason.  The  lesser  amongst  us  who  lived  along  the  coast  in  Ala-
bama,  Mississippi,  and  New  Orleans  have  been  displaced  because
their  economic  conditions  would  not  permit  them  to  rebuild  or  did
they  live  in  an  area  where  they  could  move  to  a  family.  And  as  a
result of that, we have seen evacuees throughout this nation be dis-
lodged from their home. I do not believe there is a state in this na-
tion  that  has  not  accepted  evacuees.  Those  who  have  lost  their
homes  and  everything  that  they  have  and  the  ability  even  to  sur-
vive  and  in  many  cases,  the  retirees,  their  small  Social  Security
check that can help them have some means of living in many cases
to  them  what  would  appear  to  be  almost  a  foreign  country  moving
from  their  home  in  the  gulf  inland  to  states  all  across  this  nation.
I  think  all  of  us  have  felt  and  have  been  made  aware  of  and  can
see the damage that has occurred.

So  it  is  my  hope  that  those  of  us  here  in  Congress  realize  that
it  is  our  responsibility  as  a  nation  to  be  sure  that  we  adequately
fund the weather predictors which is NOAA and that we do not cut
dollars  in  that  area.  I  applaud  the  efforts,  I  applaud  the  accuracy
of the agency that has provided us with a safety net in many cases
for  those  to  escape.  That  happened  when  Rita  visited  the  area  of
Texas and we saw lesser at least personal harm done to those.

Having  said  that,  I  would  yield  the  remainder  of  my  time  to  a
Ranking  Member  with  permission  from  the  Chairman  to  Rep-
resentative Bart Gordon from Tennessee.

COMMUNICATING WITH MEDIA

Mr. GORDON. I thank my friend from Tennessee.
There  is  a  variety  of  things  that  we  do  not  know  but  I  think  a
couple  of  things  that  we  do  know  is  that  it  is  unfortunately  inevi-
table  that  there  will  be  another  catastrophe  of  this  magnitude  or
worse  whether  it  is  by  force  of  nature  or  force  of  man.  And  the
other  thing  that  we  know  is  that  on  the  federal,  State,  and  prob-
ably  local  level,  our  governments  did  not  serve  us  as  well  as  they
should  and  we  would  hope  for  them  to  do.  So  it  is  important  that
we look at what went right, look at what went wrong, try to make
preparations  for  the  future  to  get  the  wrongs  to  the  right.  I  think
in  doing  that,  it  is  important  that  we  have  transparency.  I  think
it  is  also  important  that  we  have  an  independent  commission  that
will  review  the  various  information  and  try  to  make  non-partisan,
non-bias  suggestions.  But  again  to  do  that,  it  has  got  to  be  trans-
parent.

And  so  I  want  to  get  a  few  things  on  the  record  because  I  am
confident  that  in  trying  to  do  the  right  thing  we  will  have  this
independent commission later. So General, if you would, let us see,
would you put up the memo, please?

General,  just  again,  just  for  the  record,  I  cannot  speak  to  the
truth  or  not  of  this.  This  was  on  a  blog  supposedly  leaked  from
NOAA  staff.  It  is  concerning  a  memo  that  went  out  on  Thursday,
the  29th  of  September  2005  from  a  Jim  T-e-e-t,  is  that  how  you
pronounce that, his name?

Mr. JOHNSON. I believe so, sir.
Mr.  GORDON.  Okay.  And  you  can  tell  me  whether  this  is  accu-
rate.  ‘‘Good  day  all.  I  have  been  informed  that  any  request  for  an
interview  with  a  national  media  outlet  reporter  must  now  receive
prior  approval  by  DOC,  Department  of  Commerce.  Please  ensure

77

everyone  on  your  staff  is  aware  of  this  requirement.  Any  request
for  an  interview  requires  that  the  following  information  to  be  for-
warded to me immediately so this process may begin. The name of
the  reporter  and  their  affiliation,  their  deadline,  the  contact  num-
ber,  the  name  of  the  individual  being  requested  for  the  interview,
the  purpose  of  the  interview,  additional  background  information
about  the  interview  subject,  and  expertise  of  the  requested
interviewee  on  the  subject.  The  request  will  be  forwarded  through
NWS, NOAA to DOC. However, the individual to be interviewed ul-
timately will be determined by DOC.’’

Is that an accurate memo?
Mr.  JOHNSON.  Sir,  I  would  say  that  memo  did  go  out.  It  is,  in

fact, a——

Mr.  GORDON.  That  is  fine.  This  was  what  I  wanted  to  know
whether  that  was  accurate  so  it  was  not  just  something  very——
Mr. JOHNSON. No, sir. It is a statement of a long standing policy.

The term now is an unfortunate choice of——

Mr. GORDON. I think it is also unfortunate that as we try to have
transparency and find out what went wrong that apparently mem-
bers of your organization have to go through some type of a buffer.
I  think  that  is  unfortunate,  too  but  let  me  continue  to  try  to  get
some things on the record here.

I want to note that we asked on this side for several things that
we  have  not  been  delivered.  We  have  requested  for  the  reports  in
whatever  form  they  may  take  that  are  produced  by  NOAA  em-
ployee who works at the NOAA desk in the Homeland Security Op-
erations Center. My understanding is the Department of Homeland
Security  is  raising  objections  to  this  request  as  are  counsel  at  the
department.  So  I  want  to  deliver  a  formal  request  for  those  docu-
ments  today  and  they  will  be  given  to  you.  Go  ahead,  Leigh  Ann.
This  letter  also  asks  that  the  department  make  available  to  our
staff  the  person  who  was  assigned  to  the  HSOC  desk  so  that  we
may  interview  that  person.  We  asked  that  earlier  but  again  there
has  been  national  security  objections  hinted  in  the  refusals.  Gen-
eral  Johnson,  I  hope  you  will  do  all  you  can  to  shake  these  things
loose.  It  is  silly  to  think  that  there  is  anything  referred  to  in
NOAA’s  work  on  Hurricane  Katrina  that  could  in  any  way  com-
promise national security.

Further, I ask that two letters be entered into the record. I have
written  to  the  White  House  asking  for  the  transcript  of  the  HLT
briefing  the  President  participated  in.  I  also  asked  for  the  names
of any White House staff who communicated with NOAA regarding
Katrina.

In the second letter, you will see that I have asked FEMA to re-
lease  any  reports  they  maintain  of  the  HLT  briefing  from  August
27  and  August  28.  I  have  not  received  any  sort  of  response  to  ei-
ther letter. [See Appendix 2: Additional Material for the Record.]

Now General, my interest is not playing a game of got you. It is
trying  to  do  legitimate  oversight.  As  we  said,  this  is  going  to  hap-
pen  again  in  some  way  or  the  other.  We  need  to  be  prepared.  My
wife and daughter live here in the District and I suspect that a va-
riety  of  your  employees,  maybe  your  family,  Members  here  today
have  family  here.  It  is  very  likely  that  this  region  could  be  one  of
those  hit  with  a  catastrophe,  more  likely  the  man  kind  than  the

sons, try to prepare. This is a matter of life and death.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Mr. EHLERS. The gentleman’s time has more than expired. I was
generous  in  giving  him  extra  time  because  as  a  Ranking  Member
he  is  entitled  to  a  closing  statement.  That  may  not  have  been  a
wise decision but we appreciate your efforts to get at some of these
issues.

Just a quick question to wrap it up and then I will have a closing
statement. I would like to ask you is there anything that you need
from the Congress, anything that the Congress could do that would
help you do a better job forecasting and warning about hurricanes.
In  other  words,  do  you  in  your  experience  of  the  past  few  years  of
this,  has  anything  come  to  mind  where  we  are  getting  in  the  way
rather than helping the process?

Mr.  JOHNSON.  Sir,  in  my  opening  oral  testimony  I  thanked  you
and  the  Committee  for  your  support  after  last  year.  The  oral  re-
marks  also  talked  about  modeling  and  observing  and  we  can  al-
ways do a better job. I am anxious for the Air Force to get the sen-
sors modified and airplanes up to speed. And I look forward to the
’06 budget, as well as the other activities that can help support us
overall.  We  are  very  appreciative  of  what  you  have  already  done.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you.
Mr. Mayfield, do you have anything to add?
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  No.  We  certainly  appreciate  everything  that  you
have done. And those buoys that the Congress helped us get at the
end of last year have been very, very, very useful already in several
storms  and  hurricanes  already.  And  we  certainly  will  appreciate
the additional support here as we continue to improve.

Mr. EHLERS. Well thank you.
And I would like to just make a few closing comments along the
lines  of  Mr.  Rohrabacher  and  Mr.  Davis  pointing  out  how  far  we
have come. We often neglect that, but I must say as I watched this
unfold  on  my  own  TV  screen,  I  could  not  help  but  marvel  at  the
changes  from  my  childhood.  I  grew  up  on  the  plains  of  Minnesota
and  we  used  to  have  what  we  called  cyclones  then  not  tornadoes.
No  warning  whatsoever.  Everyone  just  watched  the  sky  and  when
it  got  bad  enough,  you  headed  for  the  basement.  And  sometimes
you miscalculated. Some real tragedies occurred as a result. Today,
we have tremendous warning systems for hurricanes, floods, torna-
does  and  particularly  the  satellites.  And  we  often  hear  complaints
from the public about wasting our tax money, et cetera. I think this
is  a  good  example  of  good  use  of  tax  money.  Obviously  it  costs
much,  much  more  to  run  the  National  Weather  Service  relatively
speaking  than  it  did  40  years  ago,  but  I  would  maintain  that  in-
vestments in science such as we are doing in this case have a very
good rate of return. I am certain that the lives saved even property
damage  averted  as  a  result  of  the  work  that  you  do  and  that  you
have done not just in forecasting but making us aware of the dan-
gers of nature, the tax money has more than paid for itself and the
extra  information  provided  in  particularly  in  the  saving  of  lives.
And I think that is a very important point to note.

I  also  would  comment  there  was  some  comment  made  earlier
about the lack of funding for NOAA and what happens in the budg-
et. Unfortunately, NOAA frequently in the past has been the target

84

of  what  we  politely  here  call  earmarks  in  which  money  is  diverted
from a good cause such as the Weather Service or other areas and
assigned  to  some  other  cause  which  in  the  eyes  of  the  earmarked
is more appropriate and more important. I think it is time that the
Congress  and  the  Nation  wake  up  and  realize  NOAA  is  really  im-
portant. This is not a little pork barrel that people can dip into and
move  the  pork  somewhere  else.  The  work  you  do  is  extremely  im-
portant  to  the  livelihood  of  our  nation,  particularly  in  agriculture
and shipping but in other ways as well and we certainly appreciate
what you have done.

I hope that the new satellites we are putting up are going to help
you even more and do a better job. The new supercomputers which
this  committee  has  initiated  the  funding  for  will  help  you  do  a
more accurate reporting and forecasting. I think if you hold a simi-
lar  hearing  ten  years  from  now,  I  do  not  expect  to  be  here  but  I
am sure that my successors will find even more astonishing results
and even better forecasting in the future.

So I want to thank you for being here today, for testifying before
the  Committee.  It  has  been  a  highly  educational  hearing.  And  you
have given this committee a lot to consider about the role of NOAA
in  hurricane  prediction.  If  there  is  no  objection,  the  record  will  re-
main open for additional statements from the Members and for an-
swers  to  any  follow  up  questions  the  Committee  may  ask  of  the
panelists.  Without  objection  so  ordered.  The  hearing  is  now  ad-
journed.

[Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Brigadier General David L. Johnson (ret.), Assistant Administrator for
Weather Services; Director, The National Weather Service, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce

Questions submitted by the Majority
Q1. What  are  the  various  notification  systems  the  National  Weather  Service  uses  to
disseminate  weather  warnings  and  information?  For  each  notification  system,
please  explain  how  Federal,  State  and  local  government  officials  receive  the  in-
formation.  For  each  level  of  government  (Federal,  State  and  local),  please  ex-
plain how the National Weather Service (including its local weather forecast of-
fices)  confirms  that  government  officials  received  emergency  messages.  Do  these
procedures  change  in  case  of  an  ‘‘incident  of  national  significance’’  declared  by
the Department of Homeland Security?

A1. National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  warnings  are  distributed  through  a  vast  dis-
semination  network.  These  systems  include  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards
(NWR),  which  can  reach  anyone  in  the  area  who  has  a  NWR  receiver;  NOAA
Weather  Wire  Service;  Emergency  Managers  Weather  Information  Network
(EMWIN); Internet; local paging systems to emergency managers; high-speed direct
communications with users of large volumes of weather data (i.e., commercial mete-
orological firms) connected by landlines (Family of Services), by satellite broadcasts
(NOAAPORT),  or  both.  The  media  uses  one  or  more  of  these  feeds  to  receive  the
information  and  then  rebroadcast  it.  Federal,  State,  and  local  officials  typically  re-
ceive  weather  warnings  and  information  from  different  combinations  of  the  above
systems. Some officials also obtain information from the private sector.

These dissemination systems do not have a mechanism in place to verify the user
received the message. However, each state emergency operations center has a direct
feed  from  the  NOAA  Weather  Wire  Service,  paid  for  by  the  NWS,  to  help  ensure
NWS  warnings  and  other  information  are  received  by  emergency  managers.  The
State  emergency  managers  then  redistribute  the  data  and  information,  as  appro-
priate, to local emergency managers. Government officials also typically receive mes-
sages  from  several  systems  (listed  above).  During  major  weather  situations,  many
NWS offices or regional headquarters send a meteorologist to State emergency oper-
ations  centers,  or  place  phone  calls  to  these  centers  to  ensure  emergency  managers
have the most current information and interpretation possible.

These procedures do not change for an ‘‘incident of national significance.’’

Q2. For  each  notification  system  described  in  the  answer  to  question  one,  please  ex-
plain  how  often  the  National  Weather  Service  and  its  local  forecast  offices  test
the  systems  to  make  sure  they  are  working.  Are  the  notification  systems  redun-
dant  to  such  a  degree  that  no  significant  communications  capability  would  be
lost if any one of the notification systems fails to function during a severe weath-
er event?

A2. Each  local  weather  forecast  office  tests  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  All  Hazards
(NWR)  Network  in  its  local  area  once  a  week  to  ensure  the  system  is  operating.
Other  dissemination  systems  are  monitored  continuously  at  the  National  Weather
Service  Telecommunication  Gateway  and  any  communications  outages  are  ad-
dressed immediately.

If  a  NWR  transmitter  becomes  inoperable,  messages  are  not  transmitted  to  the
NWR  receivers.  NOAA  is  working  to  further  increase  the  reliability  of  NOAA
Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR) transmitters to allow operation in adverse condi-
tions,  when  normal  communications  systems  can  fail.  Nearly  $5M  in  funding  pro-
vided  to  NOAA  in  the  FY  2006  hurricane  supplemental  will  be  used  to  provide
backup electrical power for NOAA Weather Radios and Automated Surface Observ-
ing Sites in coastal areas. Not only is NWR network reliability important, increasing
the  number  of  individuals  who  own  NWR  receivers  is  also  critical.  NOAA  works
with  the  private  sector  to  promote  the  use  of  NWR  receivers  and  recently  worked
with  FEMA  and  the  Department  of  Education  to  distribute  16,000  NOAA  Weather
Radios  to  public  schools  across  the  country.  Also,  with  $1M  in  additional  funding
provided  in  the  supplemental,  NOAA  will  expand  the  NWS  Weather  Wire  Satellite
Communication  System  to  improve  communications  capability  at  coastal  Weather
Forecast  Offices  for  timely  transmission  of  weather  warnings  to  the  public  and  the
media.

One benefit of having multiple dissemination systems is redundancy. If one meth-
od is non-operational, others still disseminate important information. However, this

87

strategy  is  successful  only  when  recipients  have  access  to  multiple  dissemination
systems.  Redundancy  is  one  of  the  items  stressed  in  the  National  Weather  Service
StormReady  program,  to  ensure  communities  and  emergency  managers  can  receive
warnings and information different ways. Communities can receive NWS and emer-
gency messages through NWS dissemination systems which include NOAA Weather
Radio All Hazards (NWR), which can reach anyone in the area who has a NWR re-
ceiver;  NOAA  Weather  Wire  Service;  Emergency  Managers  Weather  Information
Network  (EMWIN);  Internet;  local  paging  systems  to  emergency  managers;  and  via
commercial meteorological or communication (e.g., phone) companies.
Q3. What  are  NOAA’s  back-up  procedures  during  severe  storms  if  a  radar,  buoy,  or
entire  local  weather  forecast  office  is  destroyed  or  cannot  communicate?  Please
explain  the  circumstances  that  would  trigger  back-up  procedures.  Were  any
back-up  procedures  triggered  during  Hurricanes  Katrina  or  Rita?  If  so,  please
explain what happened and what NOAA is doing to fix any damage.

A3. The National Weather Service (NWS) has robust backup procedures in place to
ensure  continuity  of  operations.  The  NWS  radar  network  was  designed  to  provide
radar coverage for the contiguous United States to ensure radar coverage for severe
weather,  including  hurricanes.  Should  a  radar  fail,  adjacent  radar  stations  and
other  observation  systems  provide  sufficient  coverage.  Other  observation  systems,
such  as  satellites  and  surface  observation  stations,  provide  a  sufficient  level  of  cov-
erage to assist meteorologists in the forecast and warning function. NOAA operated
WSR–88D radars have an operational availability of 99.1 percent.

NOAA/NWS  recently  added  connection  to  four  Federal  Aviation  Administration
Terminal Doppler Weather Radars—Orlando, FL; West Palm Beach, FL; New Orle-
ans,  LA;  and  Houston,  TX—in  hurricane-prone  areas  as  another  mechanism  to  en-
sure  weather  radar  data  are  available  to  forecasters.  During  both  Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita all radars remained operational, providing data to the local weath-
er forecast offices.

NOAA/NWS  buoys  have  redundant  wind  sensors  and  barometers  that  provide
data  if  the  primary  instrument  fails.  Several  of  the  large  buoys,  including  three  in
the Gulf of Mexico and the seven new buoys deployed with FY04 Hurricane Supple-
mental  funds  have  a  complete  second  operational  system  on  board  that  serves  as
a  back-up.  Should  a  buoy  suffer  catastrophic  damage,  which  rarely  occurs,  NOAA
maintains  a  network  of  large  buoys  which  provide  some  overlapping  coverage.  Fur-
ther, other weather observation systems (for example satellites and hurricane recon-
naissance  flights)  also  provide  coverage.  Repairing  buoys  is  a  high  priority  but  de-
pends  on  ship  availability.  NOAA  fixes  damaged  buoys  within  the  Atlantic  Hurri-
cane  Basin  as  quickly  as  possible,  usually  within  a  few  months.  NOAA/NWS  can
also  provide  manual  backup  should  an  automated  surface  observing  system  fail  at
a Weather Forecast Office (WFO) or major airport.

During  Hurricane  Katrina,  the  NWS  implemented  backup  coverage  for  the  New
Orleans, Louisiana; Lake Charles, Louisiana; and Jackson, Mississippi offices when
communications  to  and  from  the  offices  were  lost  due  to  an  MCI/communications
backbone  failure.  The  FY  2006  Hurricane  Katrina/Rita  Emergency  Supplemental
provides NOAA $1M to improve (harden) hurricane-prone WFOs communication ca-
pabilities via backup satellite communications. The NWS offices in Mobile, Alabama;
Houston,  Texas;  and  Huntsville,  Alabama  assumed  forecast  and  warning  responsi-
bility for the area normally covered by the New Orleans, Lake Charles, and Jackson
offices,  respectively.  During  Hurricane  Rita,  the  NWS  implemented  backup  oper-
ations for the Lake Charles, Louisiana WFO when the office lost its communications
just after landfall. The backup service was provided by the WFO in Houston, Texas.
Q4. In your testimony you mentioned that at the end of each hurricane season NOAA
leads  a  ‘‘hot  wash’’  to  review  all  of  its  hurricane  procedures  with  emergency
managers  and  weather  forecasters.  Please  provide  the  following  information
about the annual hot wash:

Q4a. Who from Federal, State, and local government agencies participates in the an-
nual  hot  wash?  Who  from  the  private  sector  participates?  Do  you  solicit  input
and/or participation from non-governmental organizations and the public?

Q4b. What is the process for selecting participants?
Q4c. What is the process for reviewing and prioritizing recommendations that result

from the hot wash?

Q4d. What  is  the  process  for  providing  resources,  if  needed,  for  implementing  pri-

ority recommendations?

Q4e. What  ‘‘hot  wash’’  recommendations  were  made  in  the  last  three  years?  Which
of these recommendations have been implemented and which have not been im-
plemented?  If  applicable,  please  explain  why  recommendations  were  not  imple-
mented.

A4a,b,c,d,e. Answer:  The  ‘‘hot  wash’’  (a  colloquialism  for  a  series  of  agency-directed
reviews)  is  a  review  and  analysis  of  the  past  hurricane  season  and  occurs  on  many
levels.  The  first  is  an  internal  NOAA  examination  of  operations  and  procedures  to
see  what  went  well  and  where  improvements  could  be  made.  The  second  is  the
Interdepartmental  Hurricane  Conference,  an  internal  Federal  Government  review,
which includes NOAA, the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment  Agency,  NASA,  the  National  Science  Foundation,  and  others.  And  finally,  a
National Hurricane Conference is conducted which includes all levels of government,
as well as emergency managers, private sector meteorologists, and media represent-
atives.  Participation  in  the  National  Hurricane  Conference  is  open  to  everyone.
Local Weather Forecast Offices also conduct more informal analyses of hurricane op-
erations  and  work  with  their  local  emergency  management  counterparts  to  identify
best  practices  and  where  improvements  in  the  overall  hurricane  program  can  be
made.

Attached  are  summaries  of  the  recommendations  from  the  NOAA  review  and  the
Federal  Government  review  for  the  past  three  years  (included  as  Appendix  1  and
2, respectively). It is a high priority for NOAA and the NWS to implement as many
of the recommendations as possible for the next hurricane season using existing re-
sources and follow normal funding request procedures if necessary.
Q5. Is the ability to forecast marine wave height and wind speed important for pre-
dicting storm surge and inland flooding? If so, please explain why. What are the
current  capabilities  of  NOAA  to  forecast  marine  wave  height  and  wind  speed?
Does  NOAA  require  additional  observational  equipment  to  improve  wave  fore-
casts?

A5. Storm surge predictions are based on the size of the storm, the strength of the
winds  and  the  bathymetry  of  the  ocean.  Predicting  the  size  and  strength  of  the
storm  remains  most  critical  to  storm  surge  prediction.  Winds  push  water  ahead  of
the storm, causing the water level to rise along the shoreline. The stronger the wind
and  the  larger  the  wind  field,  the  larger  the  storm  surge  will  be.  Waves  are  also
driven  by  surface  wind  speed.  NOAA’s  operational  numerical  computer  wave  model
(WAVEWATCH) provides predictions of wave height for NOAA forecasters to use as
they prepare storm surge forecasts. Wave predictions from the WAVEWATCH model
at  24  hours  are  accurate  to  within  about  1@  feet  during  the  summer  and  about  2c
feet  on  average  during  the  stormy  winter  months.  The  WAVEWATCH  model  will
eventually  be  coupled  to  the  Hurricane  Weather  Research  and  Forecasting  Model
to provide an advanced storm surge model. Battering coastal waves also push water
up  along  the  coastline.  In  fact,  the  battering  waves  that  were  on  top  of  the  storm
surge were responsible for the extensive damage along North Carolina during Isabel
and  the  catastrophic  damage  along  the  Northern  Gulf  of  Mexico  coastline  during
Katrina.  $2.5M  was  provided  in  the  FY  2006  hurricane  supplemental  to  accelerate
storm  surge  forecasting,  which  includes  improvements  to  the  Sea  Lake  and  Over-
land Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model.

Additional  observations,  such  as  those  planned  under  the  Global  Environmental
Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS),  will  help  improve  model  predictions.
NOAA  is  working  with  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  to  de-
velop  new  observing  technologies,  such  as  a  scanning  radar  altimeter.  When  flown
on the NOAA P–3 aircraft, this new technology can provide valuable information as
was  demonstrated  during  Hurricane  Rita.  Data  from  the  instrument  were  used  to
help measure significant wave height and transmit that information directly the Na-
tional Hurricane Center.

Inland flooding associated with hurricanes is generally due to freshwater flooding
from hurricane-related rainfall, not wind driven storm surge or waves. With funding
provided  in  the  FY  2006  hurricane  supplemental  ($2.5M),  we  are  accelerating  the
development  of  new  localized  flood-forecast  products  and  services  for  hurricane-
prone states.
Q6. What  is  the  status  of  all  marine  buoys  in  the  Caribbean  and  Gulf  of  Mexico?
According  to  an  article  in  the  Miami  Herald  on  October  9,  2005,  the  National
Hurricane Center needs 13 additional marine buoys ($250,000/buoy) to improve
its  hurricane  forecasts.  Why  has  NOAA  not  requested  funding  for  additional
buoys?

89

A6. All  of  the  marine  buoys  in  the  Caribbean  and  Gulf  of  Mexico  are  operational.
NOAA  used  funding  from  the  Military  Construction  Appropriations  and  Emergency
Hurricane  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act,  2005  (P.L.  108–324)  to  deploy  seven
buoys  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  Caribbean  Sea  and  Atlantic  Ocean.  These  buoys  pro-
vided critical data to help forecasters accurately track and predict the intensity and
path  of  hurricanes  during  the  2005  hurricane  season.  With  incorporation  of  the
eight  buoys  provided  in  the  FY  2006  hurricane  supplemental,  NOAA  believes  the
current  configuration  is  adequate.  Additional  observations,  are  also  being  planned
under the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) to further improve
predictions.
Q7. According  to  an  article  in  the  Miami  Herald  on  October  9,  2005,  older
dropwindsondes fail at least half the time in strong winds but it would only cost
$1  million  to  fully  upgrade  to  newer,  more  resilient  dropwindsondes.  What  are
the  failure  rates  for  old  and  new  dropwindsondes  in  high  winds?  When  will
NOAA’s old supply of dropwindsondes be depleted such that the agency will only
rely  on  newer  dropwindsondes?  If  NOAA  has  known  that  it  would  only  take  $1
million to upgrade the dropwindsondes, why didn’t NOAA fix this problem soon-
er?

A7. Failure  of  older  dropsondes  in  high  winds  occurs  primarily  in  the  very  lowest
level winds (about 500 feet altitude), when wind speeds exceeded 100–112 miles per
hour. NOAA worked with the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Air
Force Reserve Command to test an updated dropsonde in 2004 that performed more
reliably  in  these  high  wind  situations.  These  new  dropsondes  were  mass  produced
by  the  primary  vendor  (Vaisala)  and  used  for  most  of  the  2005  hurricane  season.
Preliminary  indications  are  that  the  new  dropsondes  performed  in  2005  as  well  as
they did in the tests in 2004, with no failures reported in high winds. However, we
are  still  evaluating  their  performance  to  ascertain  whether  these  new  dropsondes
have  any  limitations  of  their  own.  NOAA  has  only  220  of  the  older  dropsondes  in
stock which will be used before the next hurricane season.
Q8. For  the  past  five  years,  what  is  the  annual  number  of  Doppler  radar  failures
due to lightning strikes? Where did these failures occur geographically? What is
the  justification  for  not  pursuing  the  $3.5  million  fiber  optic  solution  for  pro-
tecting Doppler radars from lightning strikes? What lightning protection projects
has NOAA completed or is NOAA planning to complete in lieu of the fiber optic
solution? What has been or is predicted to be the cost of those projects?

A8. On  average,  25  of  158  operational  WSR–88D  radar  systems  have  been  dam-
aged,  apparently  due  to  lightning  strikes,  annually  during  the  last  five  years  (17
in  2005;  33  in  2004;  27  in  2003;  34  in  2002;  and  12  in  2001).  Radars  in  all  areas
of  the  contiguous  United  States  have  received  lightning  damage;  this  type  of  dam-
age is not any more or less prevalent in any one geographical location. Radar towers
are  usually  the  tallest  structure  in  the  local  area,  making  them  a  likely  target  for
lightning strikes. NOAA operated WSR–88D radars have an operational availability
of 99.1 percent. The average time to repair a radar is about 6.5 hours.

Recognizing early in the program that radars are susceptible to lightning strikes,
NOAA/NWS  took  aggressive  action  to  make  the  radars  more  robust.  We  focused  on
actions  that  would  have  the  most  immediate  and  largest  payback.  NOAA/NWS  has
completed  several  lightning  mitigating  projects  as  part  of  sustaining  engineering
and retrofit actions:

(1) Stocking lightning sensitive spare parts at field sites and in a ‘‘lightning kit’’
maintained at our logistics centers, to reduce radar down time due to await-
ing parts delivery.

(2) A  retrofit  of  the  grounding  grid  at  radar  sites  in  1993–1998  ($1.9  million)
greatly  reduced  lightning  susceptibility  and  reduced  the  number  of  light-
ning-damaged radar parts by an estimated 50 percent.

(3) Surge protection devices were added to the radar shelters in three different

projects ($732,000).

(4) Replacement  of  aging  copper  communication  lines  with  fiber  optic  commu-
nication lines which are less susceptible to lightning damage/interruption in
2004–2005 ($1.6 million).

(5) Preventative  maintenance  inspections  have  been  refined  to  mitigate  light-

ning impacts.

(6) Depot-level engineering visits to the occasional sites that appear to have an
unusual  susceptibility  to  lightning  have  corrected  a  number  of  small  issues
and  subsequently  reduced  the  occurrences  of  lightning  induced  damage.  A

visit  of  this  type  was  conducted  at  the  Miami  WSR–88D  last  year  after  we
noticed  an  anomalously  high  number  of  lightning  failures.  Since  the  engi-
neering team visit, there have been no lightning failures.

(7) Transition  power  maintenance  systems  were  installed  in  1998–2003  ($45.3
million).  These  systems  enable  the  ‘‘ride  through’’  of  commercial  power  out-
ages until engine generator power becomes available and they condition the
commercial  power  to  eliminate  ‘‘spikes’’  due  to  nearby  lightning  strikes.
These features reduce the likelihood of lightning induced radar damage.

(8) A  National  Severe  Storm  Laboratory  study  in  2000  showed  the  current  ra-

dome lightning rod configuration is the most effective design.

These  initiatives  have  been  very  effective  and  made  the  radars  more  resilient
under  lightning  conditions.  It  is  important  to  note  that  it  is  not  possible  to  make
the  radars  lightning  proof  against  a  direct  strike.  However,  we  are  taking  all  steps
necessary  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  lightning.  On  those  occasions  when  radars  fail
due to a direct lightning strike, the adjacent radars are positioned to provide backup
coverage.
Q9. Please  provide  a  funding  history,  including  number  of  full-time  employees,  for

the Hurricane Research Division for the past twenty years.

A9. The first table below summarizes the funding history of the Hurricane Research
Division  for  the  past  twenty  years.  Non-base  support  includes  other  NOAA  support
received  through  funded  proposals  to  Hurricane  Research  Division  scientists
through  projects  such  as  the  Joint  Hurricane  Testbed.  Non-base  support  also  in-
cludes extramural support from other federal agencies, including the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The second table summarizes Hurricane Research Division staff history broken into
FTEs and cooperative institute (CI)/contract personnel.

NOAA  conducts  hurricane  research  not  only  at  HRD,  but  also  at  its  Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and Environmental Modeling Center. Through its hurri-
cane  research  program,  NOAA  develops  new  technologies  for  observing  hurricanes,
further  improves  its  models  for  predicting  hurricane  track  and  intensity,  and  pro-
vides  critical  assistance  to  forecasters  at  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  All  to-
gether, these efforts resulted in the vast track improvements over the past 20 years.
Q10. According  to  an  article  in  the  Miami  Herald  on  October  10,  2005,  Hurricane
Research  Division  scientists  use  sensors  called  Airborne  Expendable
Bathythermographs to measure the temperature of the ocean down to 1,000 feet.
But,  researchers  can’t  get  the  data  to  forecasters  because  they  need  to  develop
software to use the data (estimated software cost is $200,000). Is this character-
ization  accurate,  and  if  so,  why  has  NOAA  not  provided  the  funding  for  the
software development?

A10. The  October  10,  2005  Miami  Herald  article  is  correct  per  se,  in  that  software
needs  to  be  developed  to  get  the  data  to  forecasters;  however  the  article  is  inac-
curate in its implication that NOAA has neglected to fund software development as
there is no current operational requirement for the observations/data from the ocean
probes.  The  ocean  probes  used  were  acquired  from  the  Navy  surplus  by  the  Hurri-
cane  Research  Division  (HRD)  for  use  in  research  missions.  The  HRD  maintains
software to process and quality-control these data for research purposes. After these
data  are  collected  and  processed  for  quality  control,  they  are  sent  to  NOAA’s  oper-
ational modeling center to determine utility of the data.
Q11. When  does  NOAA  plan  to  completely  upgrade  all  102  stations  in  the  weather
balloon observation network? What is the failure rate for weather balloons and
what could be done to reduce the failure rate?

A11. NOAA  oversees  102  upper  air  stations  in  the  United  States  and  throughout
the  Caribbean.  Our  FY  2006  operating  plan  supports  the  upgrade  of  78  of  those
sites, which are scheduled to be upgraded by the end of Fiscal Year 2010.

During  the  period  of  October  2004  through  October  2005,  98  percent  of  launches
have  reached  the  minimum  successful  height  of  400  hecto  Pascals*  (standard  is  90
percent),  and  66  percent  of  launches  have  reached  10  hecto  Pascals*  (standard  is
60  percent).  The  system  is  meeting  the  NWS  performance  requirements.  (*Hecto
Pascals is a standard of pressure measurement used by the National Weather Serv-
ice.  At  10  hecto  Pascals,  the  balloon  is  at  a  height  of  approximately  100,000  feet.)
Q12. NOAA  has  acknowledged  that  some  hurricane  research  software  still  runs  on
old computers because the software has not been converted to run on newer ma-
chines.  Are  there  plans  to  update  the  software  to  run  on  newer  computers?  If
so, when will that update be completed? If not, why not?

A12. The  Hurricane  Research  Division  manages  a  4–5  year  information  technology
(IT)  strategy  to  upgrade  and  replace  all  IT  equipment  in  order  to  meet  NOAA’s  IT
security requirements. NOAA completed the third year of this strategy in 2005 and
we  have  replaced  or  upgraded  our  complete  network  infrastructure,  most  of  our
servers, and 67 percent of our desktop computers. Our strategy calls for completion
of the server and desktop upgrades in 2006, and completing the software update in
2007.  All  of  our  processing  software  runs  on  our  recently  upgraded  UNIX  servers,
and  we  currently  are  upgrading  some  of  the  software  that  will  run  on  the  aircraft
to  process  and  quality  control  observations  in  real  time  to  run  under  LINUX  (Air-
craft Operations Center’s preferred operating system). Last year, the Aircraft Oper-
ations  Center  provided  a  LINUX  server  for  HRD  to  use  and  we  are  purchasing  a
new  LINUX  server  this  year  to  accommodate  this  transition.  NOAA  is  working  to
streamline and upgrade the SATCOM data transfer from the aircraft to the ground
as  part  of  our  strategy  to  provide  more  data  from  the  aircraft  to  our  operational
partners.  As  part  of  this  upgrade  we  are  working  to  define  requirements  for  data
transfer  and  quality  control  of  the  data  to  ensure  the  IT  infrastructure  on  the  air-
craft meet all NOAA’s needs.

Questions submitted by the Minority
Q1. For  Hurricane  Katrina,  the  weather  forecasting  offices  that  were  in  the  main
path  of  the  hurricane  were  the  New  Orleans  forecast  office  in  Slidell,  LA;  the
Mobile  forecast  office  in  Mobile,  AL;  Jackson,  MS;  and  Lake  Charles,  LA.  For
Hurricane  Rita,  Houston,  TX  and  Lake  Charles,  LA  were  in  the  main  path  of
the storm.

According to NOAA’s daily Incident Coordination Center reports for Katrina, at
least  four  other  local  offices  were  at-the-ready  or  engaged  to  provide  backup  for
these  offices—Shreveport,  LA;  Huntsville,  AL;  Houston,  TX;  and  Tallahassee,
FL.  For  Rita,  it  appeared  to  be  the  Fort  Worth,  TX  WFO  acting  as  the  backup
office.
The  Southern  Region  Headquarters  also  provided  additional  personnel  to  the
local  forecast  offices,  the  State  emergency  operations  centers,  and  coordinated
the backup plan and response for the offices in the hurricane path.
It  appears  NWS  met  its  goal  of  maintaining  continuity  of  weather  forecasting
capabilities  overall  for  the  affected  areas  during  these  hurricanes  even  as  some
of the local offices were experiencing communication and other equipment failure
problems.  It  appears  NWS  had  a  good  internal  preparation  and  response  plan.
What  is  your  assessment  of  the  performance  of  the  NWS  internal  preparation
and  response  plan  for  these  storms?  What  changes,  if  any,  are  you  considering
to  further  improve  the  procedures  for  maintaining  continuous  NWS  forecasting
capabilities  during  hurricanes?  What  is  the  current  status  of  the  impacted
NOAA offices and equipment damaged by these two storms?

A1. The National Weather Service (NWS) plans for continuity of forecast and warn-
ing  operations  worked  well  during  Hurricane  Katrina.  Our  procedures  worked  well
but  we  are  working  to  address  some  technical  issues,  such  as  phone  line  failures,
to make these systems even more robust during natural disasters.

The  National  Data  Buoy  Center  (NWS),  the  National  Coastal  Data  Development
Center (NESDIS), and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) laboratory lo-
cated at John C. Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, MS, sustained damage. The
NWS  Weather  Forecast  Office  (WFO)  in  Slidell,  LA,  was  constructed  to  be  able  to
withstand  a  Category  3  hurricane  (with  an  internal  room  able  to  withstand  a  Cat-
egory  5),  and  sustained  minimal  damage  from  the  storm.  Power  and  communica-
tions were quickly restored to the facility. NWS WFOs in Mobile, Lake Charles, and
Houston provided backup forecast and warning services while communications were
compromised.

Additional  NOAA  facilities/equipment  which  sustained  damages  include  the
NMFS  lab  in  Pascagoula,  MS,  and  the  Office  of  Marine  and  Aviation  Operations
(OMAO) port office and warehouse, personal offices co-located at Halter Marine, and
the NOAA ship, OREGON 11, all located in Pascagoula. Also, two NOAA lab facili-
ties  in  Miami,  FL,  sustained  damage  and  two  National  Water  Level  Observation
Network (NWLON) stations are being replaced.

Ten  NWS  Automated  Surface  Observing  Systems  (ASOS)  were  impacted  by
Katrina,  mainly  by  loss  of  communications  or  power.  Two  systems  were  destroyed;
two  systems  sustained  damage  and  continue  to  have  intermittent  communications
and power problems. The Doppler radar at Slidell remained operational throughout
the storm. Once communication was restored, data were available to all users. Five
buoys  and  four  Coastal  Marine  Automated  Network  (C–MAN)  stations  were  dam-
aged  or  destroyed  by  the  two  storms.  The  buoys  and  one  of  the  C–MAN  stations
have  been  repaired.  The  offshore  platforms  containing  the  other  three  C–MAN  sta-
tions  were  demolished,  and  will  be  repaired.  The  FY  2006  Hurricane  Katrina  Sup-
plemental provides funding to repair or replace the ASOS and C–MAN stations that
remain down. We are currently awaiting local infrastructure restoration (restoration
of  commercial  power  and  communications  to  the  area)  before  we  can  address  these
repairs.
Q2. How  does  the  declaration  of  an  Incident  of  National  Significance  by  the  Sec-
retary  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  change  the  operations  of
the  National  Weather  Service  with  respect  to  regional  forecasting,  participation
in  HLT  conference  calls,  local  forecasting  or  the  other  standard  operations  of
NWS for a hurricane?
How  does  the  flow  of  information  between  NOAA  and  the  Homeland  Security
Operations  Center  (HSOC)  at  DHS  change  if  an  Incident  of  National  Signifi-
cance is declared for a hurricane?

A2. The  operations  of  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  units  do  not  change  when
an  Incident  of  National  Significance  is  declared.  Our  operation  procedures  are  de-
signed to ‘‘automatically’’ include incident escalation. NOAA/NWS responds to simi-
lar  situations  whenever  a  thunderstorm  becomes  severe  or  produces  a  tornado,  or
when  a  strong  winter  storm  develops.  To  keep  up  with  the  latest  information,  the
NOAA  Watch  Desk  at  the  Homeland  Security  Operations  Center  (HSOC)  coordi-
nates  closely  with  the  NOAA  Incident  Coordination  Center  (NOAA  ICC)  or  the  ap-

propriate  NWS  Regional  Operations  Center.  Important  products  such  as  watches,
warnings and advisories especially for significant meteorological events such as tor-
nadoes, flash floods, and blizzards—are automatically routed directly from the main
NWS  communications  center,  the  NWS  Telecommunication  Gateway,  and  trans-
mitted  via  e-mail  to  the  NOAA  Watch  Desk.  Additionally,  for  a  selected  group  of
these products, such as tornado warnings, flash flood warnings, hurricane forecasts
and  statements,  information  is  sent  directly  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Secu-
rity Senior Watch Officer in the HSOC.
Q3. The  Slidell  office  managed  to  get  a  flash  flood  message  out  about  the  levee
breach  in  New  Orleans  at  8:14  am  Central  Daylight  Time  the  morning  Hurri-
cane Katrina made landfall. The office lost its communication capability a short
time later.
The  top  of  the  Bulletin  has  a  line  that  reads:  EAS  Activation  Requested.  What
action does that request set into motion?
What systems would transmit this message and who would receive a flash flood
message of this type (e.g., the Emergency Operations Center in Baton Rouge; the
Region  VI  FEMA  office;  NWS  Southern  Regional  Headquarters)?  Please  trace
the path of this message.

A3. Transmitting the message ‘‘EAS Activation Requested’’ initiates the Emergency
Alert  System.  The  Emergency  Alert  System  (EAS)  is  designed  to  provide  the  Presi-
dent with a means to address the American people in the event of a national emer-
gency. Through the EAS, the President would have access to thousands of broadcast
stations,  cable  systems,  and  participating  satellite  programmers  to  transmit  a  mes-
sage  to  the  public.  The  EAS  and  its  predecessors,  CONELRAD  and  the  Emergency
Broadcast System (EBS), have never been activated for this purpose. But beginning
in  1963,  the  President  permitted  State  and  local  level  emergency  information  to  be
transmitted using the EBS (now EAS).

Once  activated,  the  EAS,  depending  on  the  message,  generates  tone  alerts  on
radio  stations,  crawls  or  programming  interruptions  for  television  broadcasts,  and
immediate retransmissions by ‘‘intermediaries’’ (e.g., private weather companies, tel-
evision  stations,  web-based  organizations,  etc.)  to  cell  phones,  e-mail  messages,
Internet  notifications,  etc.  The  message  is  also  immediately  broadcast  on  NOAA
Weather  Radio  All  Hazards  (NWR).  State  Emergency  Operations  Centers  are
equipped  to  receive  these  warning  messages  through  various  methods,  including
NWR,  Internet,  Emergency  Managers  Information  Network  (EMIN),  and  NOAA
Weather Wire Service (NWWS). NOAA’s responsibility is complete once the message
is transmitted; we do not verify receipt of transmission.

The flash flood warning message was transmitted by the Slidell Weather Forecast
Office  and  routed  immediately  onto  NOAA  Weather  Radio.  From  there,  the  Emer-
gency  Alert  System  was  activated,  with  the  message  and  EAS  activation  request
reaching media within seconds. The message was also transmitted through all other
NWS  dissemination  systems,  including  NOAA  Weather  Wire  Service  (NWWS),
Emergency  Managers  Weather  Information  Network  (EMIN),  NOAAPORT,  Inter-
net, Family of Services, and others.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. What role does NOAA play in providing information to the Army Corps of Engi-
neers  regarding  the  potential  and  magnitude  of  flooding  and  storm  surge  that
would  factor  into  setting  construction  standards  for  the  New  Orleans  levee  sys-
tem? How often is this information updated?

A1. NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  runs  the  SLOSH  (Sea,  Lake,  and
Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model in simulation studies to estimate potential
hurricane  storm  surge  flooding.  This  work  is  done  as  part  of  comprehensive  hurri-
cane  evacuation  planning.  Data  from  these  model  simulation  studies  are  used,  in
addition  to  other  relevant  information,  to  develop  evacuation  plans.  NOAA/NWS
also  runs  the  SLOSH  model  for  post-storm  analysis,  using  the  exact  track  of  the
storm, to help assess storm impacts.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and FEMA are the primary Federal
agencies  providing  funding  for  these  SLOSH  simulation  studies.  NOAA  is  respon-
sible  for  running  the  simulations.  The  Atlantic  and  Gulf  coastlines  of  the  United
States,  from  Texas  to  Maine,  can  be  divided  into  41  geographic  regions,  or  basins.
SLOSH updates are generated for each of the 41 basins, including the New Orleans
area,  according  to  a  list  of  priorities  established  by  the  Interagency  Coordinating
Committee  on  Hurricanes  (ICCOH),  of  which  the  USACE,  FEMA,  and  NOAA  are

95

members. The ICCOH determines when the SLOSH model studies are updated, and
makes the request to NOAA. These NOAA simulations are used primarily for evacu-
ation  studies  and  planning.  NOAA  conducted  SLOSH  model  simulation  studies  for
the  New  Orleans  area  in  1989,  1994,  and  2002.  These  studies  are  not  done  on  a
scheduled basis, but when levee data or upgrades to the storm surge model physics
warrant,  and  as  resources  permit.  SLOSH  is  used  primarily  by  the  USACE  to  sup-
port evacuation studies and emergency response activities.

For  engineering  studies  and  flood  protection  structure  design  the  USACE  uses
NOAA wind fields and other storm meteorological data as well as bathymetric map
products to drive high resolution storm surge and wave models.

At  the  request  of  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  NOAA’s  Office  of  Oceanic
and  Atmospheric  Research  provides  post-storm  analysis  of  wind  fields  to  assist
USACE post-storm analysis of storm surge modeling and impact.

NOAA 2003 Hurricane Conference Action Items

Recommendation:  Add  the  GPS  dropwindsonde  splash  time  to  the  TEMP  DROP
62626 section. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Identify  simplest  mechanisms  to  get  P–3  the  data  to  the  GTS.
Implemented.
Recommendation:  Attendees  to  make  decisions  regarding  Tropical  Cyclone  Wind
Team  for:  what  type  of  34-,  50-,  and  64-kt  wind  distribution  should  be  represented
for  tropical  depressions,  tropical  storms,  and  hurricanes;  whether  a  wind  team  is
needed, and whether the team charter should be continued and why. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Include  three-  to  five-day  tropical  cyclone  information  in  the
Offshore Waters Forecasts. Implemented.
Recommendation:  NWS  grids  need  to  be  consistent  between  coastal  WFOs  and
OPC. Implemented.
Recommendation:  WFOs  need  to  ensure  consistent  information  when  re-issuing
NHC products. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Rerun  the  SLOSH  model  ‘‘MOMs’’  using  larger  storm  wind
fields,  farther  west  tracks,  climatologically  curved  tracks,  and  for  time  periods  that
extend well beyond the storm center’s passage. Implemented.
Recommendation: Redo  the  PC  SLOSH  version  of  the  Chesapeake  Basin  used  by
WFOs with these modifications. Implemented.
Recommendation: Make storm specific SLOSH output available to the field offices
24 hours prior to landfall. Output from several runs with tracks both to the left and
right of the official forecast track, and perhaps of different categories, would be val-
uable. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Allow  WFOs  to  run  storm  specific  surge  models  locally.  Not
Implemented—Computer  resources  not  available  locally,  and  differing  solutions
could hamper preparedness actions.
Recommendation:  Work  in  partnership  with  the  academic  sector  to  develop  a
more sophisticated storm surge model. Implemented.
Recommendation: Work  in  partnership  with  the  academic  sector  to  develop  prob-
abilistic methods of displaying storm surge forecasts. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Work  in  partnership  with  the  academic  sector  to  develop  high
resolution storm surge inundation mapping. Implemented.
Recommendation:  When  forecasting  positions  over  land,  decay  the  winds  accord-
ing to model guidance. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Reword  Section  6.1.1  of  NWSI  10–601  to  clarify  requirements
of  offices  designated  as  ‘‘inland’’  by  regions,  for  issuing  and  updating  NPWs  for  In-
land Tropical Storm/Hurricane Watch/Warnings. Implemented.
Recommendation: An automated solution needs to be found so all approved break
points  are  handled  by  the  NHC  software  and  so  in  the  future,  it  correctly  plots
watches and warnings affecting the Chesapeake Bay area on the NHC Web site. Im-
plemented.
Recommendation: Develop a method for allowing local offices to correct erroneous
tropical  issuances,  bearing  in  mind  this  includes  web  based  products.  Will  be  Im-
plemented—Awaiting  AWIPS  software  build  to  establish  a  national  standard  map
and removal process by product cancellation.
Recommendation:  NWS  internet  software  should  use  FFA  to  paint  flood  watch
maps  and  NPW  to  correctly  plot  wind  warnings/advisories  during  tropical  weather.
A  product  should  be  developed  to  correctly  plot  tropical  weather  flags.  This  would
also  solve  the  problem  of  automated  NOAA  Weather  Radio  dissemination.  Imple-
mented, with modifications to use other products at this time.
Recommendation: Could TPC issue a product that would include the coastal coun-
ty codes within the TC Watch and/or Warning areas, as well as a simple line of text
detailing  the  breakpoints  of  the  watch/warning  area?  This  product  could  then  be

sent  over  AWIPS  and  used  by  the  appropriate  WFOs  to  send  to  their  CRS  broad-
cast. Will be Implemented in a future AWIPS software load.
Recommendation:  Make  surface  data  received  at  NHC  from  mobile  platforms
available  to  the  coastal  WFOs  through  AWIPS. Implemented to the degree pos-
sible—Supplemental/experimental  wind  information  data  from  non-NOAA  sources
will be accessible via the Internet, when possible.
Recommendation: Using input from TAFB, OPC and local WFOs, NHC advisories
should  include  a  statement  advising  not  just  ‘‘marine’’  interests,  but  the  public,  to
be alert for dangerous surf conditions including rip currents. Implemented.
Recommendation: Once TPC commits to beginning an advisory package for a new
system, a DSA should always be issued to inform all users. Implemented.
Recommendation:  TPC  should  be  more  diligent  to  place  additive  information
below  the  $$.  NWR  automation  software  could  also  be  modified  to  search  for  key
words  and  remove  such  from  being  broadcast.  NHC  will  make  all  efforts  to  place
product  ID  information  regarding  on-going  storms  at  the  bottom  of  the  TWO.  Im-
plemented.
Recommendation:  Determine  if  a  national  model/standardized  gHLS  format/soft-
ware should be developed for use by all WFOs. If yes, work towards developing the
national model/standard. A team approach might be most effective to move this ini-
tiative  along.  Not  Implemented—A  national  implementation  of  a  gHLS  or  some
form  of  graphical  hurricane  hazard  representation  will  not  take  place  for  the  2004
season.  OS21  talking  with  regions  about  forming  a  team  to  look  at  implementation
of  some  form  of  graphical  hurricane  hazard  product  in  2005.  Update  of  this  team
will be made at the 2004 Hurricane Conference.
Recommendation:  Initiating  and  receiving  agencies  should  coordinate  in  the  for-
mulation  of  best-track  positions  to  avoid  discontinuities  or  discrepancies  near  the
point of transfer. Implemented.
Recommendation: Expand TCU and TCE product header information to associate
these  products  with  the  particular  tropical  cyclone  they  describe.  Introduce
MIATCUATx,  MIATCEATx,  MIATCUEPx,  MIATCEEPx,  where  x  varies  from  1–5
along with the associated tropical cyclone. Implemented.
Recommendation:  TPC  and  WFOs  will  complete  their  coordination  on  the  list  of
secondary  breakpoints.  When  complete  for  a  given  year,  TPC  will  post  the  list  on
its  web  page  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  standard  breakpoints.  TPC  will  coordinate
with OCWWS, NCO, and FSL to develop a scheme for communicating via the WWA
product  breakpoint  information  (e.g.,  county  and  lat/lon)  for  any  site  not  on  the
standard and secondary list. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Change  wording  in  last  sentence  of  NWSI  10–601,  7.5  to  ‘‘The
appropriate  regions  will  ensure  Tropical  Cyclone  Center(s)  obtain  significant  infor-
mation  (e.g.,  deaths  and  damages)  from  WFOs  not  preparing  formal  post-storm  re-
ports.’’  WFOs  should  clearly  label  those  reports  which  are  unofficial  in  the  PSH,
Internet and other information source outlets. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Delete  the  definitions  of  ‘‘advisory’’  and  ‘‘hurricane  local  state-
ment’’ from NWSI 10–604. Implemented.
Recommendation: For a well forecasted storm, such as Isabel, it would appear the
New  York  City  OEM  would  usually  be  best  served  if  the  storm  that  is  handled  in
a  non-tropical  fashion  during  the  watch  phase  continued  to  be  handled  in  a  non-
tropical  fashion  during  its  warning  stage.  Similarly,  tropical  issuances  should  gen-
erally  follow  in  the  warning  phase,  if  initially  introduced  during  the  watch  stage.
However,  all  things  considered,  the  New  York  City  OEM  would  generally  opt  for
tropical versus non-tropical issuances if the situation is a ‘‘toss-up.’’ Implemented.
Recommendation:  There  needs  to  be  a  standard  operating  procedure  to  address
medium range tropical cyclone forecasting. Implemented.
Recommendation: Clarify the standard for handing off a tropical cyclone from the
TPC to the HPC. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Change  the  National  Hurricane  Operations  Plan  (NHOP)  re-
garding deployment of drifting buoys. Implemented.
Recommendation: Initiate an annual Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT) review of the
past  season’s  ‘‘lessons  learned’’  and  implement  suggested  ‘‘best  practices’’  prior  to
the beginning of the tropical season. Implemented.

Recommendation:  Develop  a  comprehensive  package  of  geographical  locations,
pronunciations and tropical related impacts pertinent to each coastal WFO. Provide
the package to the detailed HLT prior to arrival at NHC. Not Implemented—East-
ern  and  Southern  Regions  will  provide  WFOs  and  RFCs  with  templates  for  devel-
oping  standardized  information  guides,  to  include  tropical-related  impacts  and  geo-
graphical  pronunciations.  Regions  will  complete  guides  prior  to  beginning  of  2006
season with the final guides available to TPC/NHC for HLT activations.
Recommendation: Fabian, Isabel and Juan will be retired. Replacement names to
be decided at WMO RA–IV meeting. Implemented.
Recommendation: The Navy run the GFDN at 0, 6, 12, and 18Z out to 126 hours.
Forward to IHC. Implemented.

NOAA 2004 Hurricane Conference Action Items

Recommendation:  Change  NWSI  10–601  to  establish  a  ‘‘Hurricane  Eye-wall
Warning’’  product  with  unique  PIL  and  EAS  code  to  be  issued  by  WFOs  for
landfalling tropical cyclones with distinct eye-wall and inner rainband features with
destructive winds. Implemented.
Recommendation: To increase the visibility of the inland hurricane (wind) hazard,
create a new PIL (IHW?) for Inland Hurricane (Wind) Watches/Warnings to elevate/
distinguish  the  watch/warning  from  the  more  universal  non-precipitation  weather
(NPW)  PIL.  Not  Implemented—Existing  products  must  be  more  effectively  used
to communicate the potential threats.
Recommendation:  To  better  align  terminology  between  the  coastal  and  inland
watches/warnings, change the name for the (WFO issued) interior watch/warning to
‘‘Inland Tropical Storm/Hurricane Watch/Wanting.’’ Implemented.
Recommendation:  Regions  will  identify  WFOs  exempt  from  the  requirement  of
section 7.3.3.3 of NWSI 10–601. Implemented.
Recommendation: To better align NHC and WFO product issuance times, change
watch/warning  criteria  in  NWSI  section  7.3.2.2.  to  read:  A  watch  is  valid  up  to  48
hours  after  the  issuance  time.  The  valid  time  (event  start  and  end  times)  is  de-
scribed in the watch headline. A warning is valid up to 36 hours after issuance time.
The valid time (event start and end times) is described in the warning headline. Im-
plemented.
Recommendation:  To  help  direct  customers  to  NWS  WFO  products  that  empha-
size  tropical  storm  hurricane  impacts  over  non-coastal  areas,  NHC  should  include
a  general  reference  within  the  TCP  product  of  wind  impacts  occurring,  or  projected
to occur, along coastal and inland areas. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Inland  offices  may  issue  HLS-type  products  using  the  HLS
when tropical cyclone conditions are expected within part or all of the CWA. Imple-
mented.
Recommendation: Reinstate language in 10–601 Section 7.1.2.2 to allow WFOs to
issue HLSs as needed to dispel rumors or to clarify tropical cyclone related informa-
tion for their CWA. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Restructure  NWSI  10–601  to  encourage  WFOs  to  write  single
purpose  HLSs,  to  emphasize  a  specific  hazard  which  is  imminent  and/or  will  have
a potentially life-threatening impact, or to describe a significant and critical change
of short-term hazard impacts. Implemented.
Recommendation:  All  HLSs  should  include  at  least  one  headline.  Implemented.
Recommendation: Allow WFOs the flexibility to issue Special Marine Warnings on
an as needed basis during tropical storm/hurricane watches. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Use  the  standard  tropical  storm  symbol  for  subtropical  storms
on  the  NWS  unified  surface  analysis.  This  will  be  consistent  with  warning  head-
lines,  which  use  the  phrase  ‘‘. . .Tropical  Storm  Warning. . .’’  for  subtropical
storms in OPC/TPC high seas forecasts. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Decide  method  to  provide  required  information  in  header.  Im-
plemented.

Recommendation: OS21 will investigate requirements needed to expand the prod-
uct  bins  for  NHC  numbered  products  from  5  to  10.  We  will  keep  JTWC  in  mind.
Not implemented—Will be discussed at the 2005 NOAA Hurricane Conference.
Recommendation:  At  least  one  of  the  two  P–3s  will  be  operationally  configured
and  available  to  respond  within  24  hours  to  reconnaissance  taskings  from  1  June
through 30 November. The minimum operational configuration for the P–3 includes
the  SFMR  and  the  Airborne  Vertical  Atmosphere  Profiling  System.  Implemented.
Recommendation:  Decide  on  a  consistent  and  appropriate  way  of  indicating  wind
speeds for tropical cyclones in WFO text forecast products. Implemented.
Recommendation: TPC should stop producing the gridded TCM. If the current pri-
mary  FSL  hurricane  wind  tool  does  not  work,  the  new  generic  cyclonic  wind  tool
could be used as backup. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Allow  TPC/NHC  to  declare  Critical  Weather  Events.  Imple-
mented.
Recommendation:  TPC  coordinate  with  DOD  contacts  to  develop  document.  For-
ward  to  Interdepartmental  Hurricane  Conference.  Not  implemented—Rec-
ommendation withdrawn.
Recommendation:  Meet  with  Executive  members  of  the  NHC  Electronic  Media
Pool  to  assess  the  scope  of  costs  and  impact  on  local  operations;  explore  means  for
resolving  the  problem  in  the  public  interest  (convenience  and  necessity).  Realign  or
redefine resources and rules of engagement, as necessary. Implemented.
Recommendation: Initiate a low-cost pilot project to demonstrate the feasibility of
a  local  (WFO)  level  II  data  archive.  The  Melbourne,  Miami,  and  San  Juan  offices
will participate in the pilot project. TPC will coordinate among the participating of-
fices and ROC. Implemented.
Recommendation: Retire  2004  storm  names  at  the  annual  WMO  RA–IV  meeting.
It  is  likely  that  Charley,  Frances,  Ivan,  and  Jeanne  will  be  retired.  Implemented.
Recommendation:  SAB  continue  to  provide  Dvorak  satellite  classifications  for
tropical  weather  systems  in  the  Atlantic,  eastern  and  central  north  Pacific  basins.
Implemented.
Recommendation: Determine  best  method  to  use  NHC  radius  of  maximum  winds
in SPC tornado watches’ ‘‘Mean Vector’’ line. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Ensure  revised  NWS  Hurricane  Directives  are  annually  avail-
able to the field by June 1st. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Include  a  landfall  point  in  the  TCM  product.  Both  Hurrevac
and the TCM tool could be modified to incorporate this additional point and improve
the  transition  between  water  based  points/radii  and  land  based  points  which  have
already  taken  land  effects  into  account  in  their  radii.  Not  Implemented—TPC/
NHC agrees to provide guidance on landfall intensity during the Hurricane Hotline
Coordination calls.
Recommendation:  Reiterate  the  need  to  NWS  headquarters  for  ASOS  backup
power to ensure no loss of data. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Make  a  request  to  the  observation  branch  of  OCWWS  to  up-
grade  the  structural  integrity  of  ASOS  system  in  hurricane-prone  areas,  making
them more resistant to high winds. Implemented.
Recommendation: The need for a PSH in these circumstances should be based on
a  stated  need  by  TPC  for  the  data,  and  not  an  all  inclusive  directive  which  takes
no notice of whether the data is actually needed or useful. Implemented.
Recommendation:  Due  to  possible  urgency  implied  in  a  Tropical  Cyclone  Update
(TCU),  it  is  requested  that  TPC,  using  the  Hurricane  Coordination  Hotline,  alert
WFOs and other users that a TCU is about to be issued. Implemented.
Recommendation: Push SLOSH Rex files to WFOs via the AWIPS SBN. Not Im-
plemented—Action  forwarded  to  TPC  communications  specialists  in  the  Technical
Support  Branch  for  comment  and  feasibility  due  to  band  width  limitations  of  SBN.
Recommendation:  Port  the  SLOSH  software  to  the  LINUX  environment  and  im-
plement  it  for  operational  runs  on  AWIPS.  Not  Implemented—A  LINUX  version
of  this  program  already  exists,  but  it  runs  rather  slowly.  TPC  will  ask  MDL  (Will
Shaffer’s  group)  to  work,  as  time  and  resources  permit,  to  improve  the  efficiency  of
the  LINUX  SLOSH  display  software,  with  the  intent  to  migrate  eventually  to

AWIPS.  WFO  Miami  and  TPC  will  investigate  using  an  alternative  data  trans-
mission mode via the AWIPS FTP server.
Recommendation:  WFOs  need  clarification  on  the  convention  that  NHC  will  use
in  the  SLOSH  runs  to  ensure  appropriate  interpretation  of  the  product.  Imple-
mented.
Recommendation: Make operational a probabilistic storm surge model available to
forecasters that can be relayed as information to customers farther in advance than
the current approximate 12-hour practice. Implemented.
Recommendation: Make corrections to NHOP. Implemented.

2005 NOAA Hurricane Conference Action Items

Note: The 2005 NOAA Hurricane Conference occurred in December, 2005. The fol-

lowing recommendations came from that meeting and are being addressed.
Recommendation:  Discuss  pros  and  cons  of  issuing  tropical  storm/hurricane/ty-
phoon  warnings  when  conditions  are  expected  over  land,  or  along  the  coast.  Ac-
tion—Change  wording  of  first  paragraph  to  ‘‘along  the  coast.’’  Make  parallel
changes in NHOP if necessary.
Recommendation:  Update  the  directives  to  formally  extend  lead  time  of  tropical
cyclone  watches  to  48  or  60  hours.  This  will  better  support  evacuation  orders  pro-
vided by local emergency management. Action—No action required.
Recommendation: Format the Repeat section of the Tropical Cyclone Public Advi-
sory  in  the  current  paragraph  form  or  a  list.  Whatever  method  is  used,  consistent
formatting, words, dots, spaces is required. Add wind gusts. Status—open.

1. TPC will not add gusts in the public advisory.
2. OS  will  provide  documentation/examples  on  ‘‘Repeat’’  section  inconsistencies

to TPC.

3. TPC  will  take  steps  to  ensure  the  ‘‘Repeat’’  section  is  formatted  consistently

in the current narrative fashion.

Recommendation:  Add  storm  identification  numbers  to  the  TCP.  Action—Accept
Recommendation for TCP. TPC will also add storm identification number to all TPC
text products. A Public Information Statement will be disseminated.
Recommendation:  In  10–601,  stipulate  the  use  of  English  and  metric  system
measurements  in  the  TCP.  Recommend  this  include  the  storm  direction  in  km/hr,
maximum  sustained  winds  in  km/hr  and  extent  of  hurricane  and  tropical  storm
winds in km. Action—Section 1.1.3.3.a already specifies when TPC should use met-
ric  units  in  the  public  advisories.  This  section  will  be  modified  to  delete  the  part
about ‘‘except when the United States is the only country threatened.’’
Recommendation:  Delete  the  breakpoint  at  Fort  Walton  Beach.  Action—Accept-
ed. Fort Walton Beach will be deleted as a primary breakpoint, but will be retained
as a secondary breakpoint. Update NHOP.
Recommendation:  Eliminate  the  Currituck  Beach  Light  breakpoint,  and  replace
it  with  Duck,  NC.  Action—Accepted.  ERH  will  provide  latitude  and  longitude  of
Duck  breakpoint  to  OS21  and  TPC.  Update  NHOP.  Currituck  Beach  Light  will  be
retained as a secondary breakpoint.
Recommendation: Suggest substituting Card Sound Road Bridge as a replacement
break point. Card Sound Road Bridge is on the Miami-Dade/Monroe county line and
is a very tall bridge, well known by anyone in our area. By having Card Sound Road
Bridge,  tropical  cyclone  watches  and  warnings  can  then  specify  the  entire  south
coast  (Florida  Bay  coast)  of  mainland  South  Florida  in  an  appropriate  manner  (for
example—East  Cape  Sable  to  Card  Sound  Road  Bridge).  Action—Florida  City  will
be deleted as a primary breakpoint and will be retained as a secondary breakpoint.
Card Sound Bridge will become a primary breakpoint. SRH will provide latitude and
longitude of Card Sound Bridge to OS21 and TPC. Update NHOP.
Recommendation: Provide SLOSH output (MEOWs) for east moving storms in the
Morehead  City  Basin.  And  include  forward  movements  of  10  mph,  20  mph,  and  30
mph  as  options  available  to  choose  from  when  selecting  storm  variables.  Action—
This  action  will  be  prioritized  with  ICCOH  with  respect  to  other  basin  restudies.
When resources are available, NHC will work with MDL, WFO Morehead City, and

103

emergency  managers  to  test  the  Recommendations  and  incorporate  those  that  are
critical in the next restudy of the Pamlico Basin.
Recommendation:  Use  zero  (0)  as  the  baseline  water  level  during  real-time
SLOSH  runs,  which  would  then  provide  output  that  is  ‘‘pure’’  surge,  and  can  be
more  easily  inserted  into  WFO  products,  and  conveyed  to  the  public.  Action—TPC
previously  agreed  to  make  the  real-time  SLOSH  runs  at  a  0  ft  base  tide  level  for
the U.S. East Coast. TPC accepts the Recommendation. Exceptions will be arranged
by TPC and the affected WFOs based on coordination during the, event.
Recommendation:  Provide  training  material  for  real-time  SLOSH  runs.  Update
SLOSH display manual to include clear explanation of tide datum used for real-time
runs,  MEOWs  and  MOMs.  Action—A  Call  for  forecaster  attendance  at  the  Train
the Trainer course was provided to ERH and SRH in November 2005. Additionally,
written  training  material  and  distance  learning  formats  will  be  explored  by  the
Warning  Decision  Training  Branch  for  the  Tropical  Cyclone  Operations  Course.
ERH will work with NHC and MDL concerning updates to the SLOSH display man-
ual, to be approved by NHC and MDL.
Recommendation:  Based  upon  the  work  and  Recommendations  by  the  Tropical
Cyclone  Extreme  Wind  Team,  the  conference  needs  to  decide  future  actions.  Ac-
tion—For the 2006 season implement Phase II as follows:

• Add new VTEC Phenomenon Code EW,
• Develop template for WARNGEN ready by 2006 season,
• Change MND Product Type Line to Extreme Wind Warning,
• Ensure Standard Format of 1St Bullet by all WFOs,
• Use of the ‘‘Go to the lowest floor’’ Call to Action at WFO discretion,
• WFOs will follow guidance in Directive 10–601 section 7.2,
• Issue a Public Information Statement in early 2006,
• Make  decision  for  experimental  vice  official  product  addressed  by  Head-

quarters, and

• Team to begin actions for Phase III.

Recommendation: Conference to decide the future direction the wind team should
pursue or disband the team. Action—The Wind Team should continue into 2006 to
address  issues  related  to  the  usage  of  TPC’s  wind  speed  probabilities  product  in
WFO products.
Recommendation: Modify the TCV to allow local input so the counties in question
can  be  removed  as  conditions  warrant.  Action—The  action  was  subsequently  over-
taken  by  the  next  item.  All  WFOs  to  review  the  existing  ‘‘county  translation  table’’
and respond to Michelle Mainelli (TPC) by 1 February 2006 if any changes are need-
ed for 2006.
Recommendation:  Consideration  should  be  given  to  use  ‘‘Zone’’  codes  versus
‘‘County’’ FIP codes in the TCV before it is even considered to make the TCV official.
Action—For  2006  the  TCV  will  use  Zone  codes  instead  of  county  codes,  if  the  nec-
essary software changes can be made. Regions will coordinate with their WFOs and
provide  TPC  with  a  list  of  zone  codes  to  include  in  the  TCV  by  1  February  2006.
Recommendation:  Just  as  SPC  issues  watches  for  Severe  Weather  for  adjacent
coastal  waters,  NHC  needs  to,  at  minimum,  issue  guidance  as  to  the  appropriate
Watches  and/or  Warnings  that  need  to  be  taken  concerning  coastal  waters.  In  this
era  of  heightened  awareness  and  coverage  of  Tropical  events  by  the  news  media,  a
more structured approach is required. STATUS: Closed (see next item).
Recommendation:  There  needs  to  be  clarification  in  either  10–601,  granting  spe-
cific  area  responsibility  for  warnings  (by  zone  definition,  not  just  breakpoint),  or  in
10–310,  which  would  grant  the  WFO  authority  over  tropical  cyclone  watches  and
warnings  for  coastal  marine  zones.  Note  that  granting  WFO  authority  over  coastal
marine  zones  within  20  nm  may  result  in  increased  consultation  with  NHC,  since
there  can  be  a  serious  perception  issue  when  warnings  from  coastal  marine  zones
and  adjacent  coastal  land  zones  disagree.  It  is  the  opinion  of  this  WFO  that  the
warnings  and  watches  between  a  coastal  land  zone  and  an  adjacent  coastal  marine
zone  (within  20  nm)  must  agree.  Implemented—WFOs  have  full  responsibility  for
watches  and  warnings  in  their  coastal  waters,  and  will  coordinate  their  issuance
with TPC and adjacent WFOs. NWS 10–310 2.3.5 will be clarified to reflect this pol-
icy.

104

Recommendation:  To  preserve  the  existing  policy  in  10–310,  there  needs  to  be  a
choice  to  use  the  phrase  Small  Craft  Should  Remain  in  Port  that  holds  the  active
Small Craft Advisory VTEC in a continuation until the tropical cyclone watch is up-
graded  to  a  warning.  As  a  second  less-preferred  item,  we  can  require  that  Small
Craft  Advisories  be  maintained  if  necessary  (and  headlines  as  such)  until  the  trop-
ical  cyclone  watch  is  upgraded  (if  necessary)  to  a  warning.  Action—Issue  will  be
resolved  through  ongoing  OS21  update  of  NWSI  10–310.  Modify  appropriate  direc-
tives.
Recommendation: Seek agreement from OPC leading to OPC and TAFB products
stating ‘‘Maximum significant wave height XX ft. Some individual waves much high-
er.’’ Change marine directive as necessary. Action—For year-round High Seas Fore-
casts  from  OPC,  TAFB,  and  WFO  Honolulu,  the  following  statement  will  be  in-
cluded in the synopsis portion: ‘‘Seas Given In Significant Wave Heights.’’
Recommendation: Allow WFO forecast grids to more closely match TCM grid out-
put,  even  if  it  is  in  conflict  with  existing  watches/warnings.  Implemented—WFO
grids should match TCM gridded output.
Recommendation:  NHC  should  be  more  judicious  about  and  less  apt  to  issue
watch/warning combinations. Action—None required. There will be occasions when
a Tropical Cyclone Warning/Hurricane Watch combination is needed.
Recommendation:

1. Enlist  the  assistance  of  NHC/TPC  and  their  associations  with  the  engineer-
ing/academic communities to aid NYC OEM towards incorporating up-to-date
information for residents of high rise buildings. This then needs to be incor-
porated into the official ‘‘hurricane plan’’ for NYC.

2. Address  the  ‘‘canyon  effect’’  one  would  see  down  New  York  City  main  Ave-
nues,  which  we  haven’t  yet  seen  with  a  landfalling  hurricane.  Could  this
make a large difference in actual wind speed and ultimate destruction poten-
tial?

3. As a result of this, ascertain if each residential building in NYC should have
its  own  ‘‘hurricane  plan’’  detailing  the  safe  zones  in  that  building,  (e.g.,
. . .from  the  3rd  to  the  8th  floor  hallways)  and  have  this  information  deliv-
ered to all tenants annually?

Action—WFO Upton will contact several organizations, such as the NOAA Air Re-
sources Laboratory, who have technical expertise in this area.
Recommendation:  HPC  generated  forecast  maps  through  Day  6  should  include
remnants for tropical systems. Implemented.
Recommendation: Eliminate issuing separate products NPW/FFA except for short
fused warnings for inland areas. Action—Members of this conference, led by David
Manning,  WFO  Sterling,  are  tasked  to  write  a  short  white  paper  that  recommends
consolidation  of  the  current  suite  of  WFO  tropical  cyclone  products,  including  seg-
mentation of the HLS, and submit to OS21 by 1 February 2006.
Recommendation: Delete forecasting wind gust from cyclones after they transition
into  an  extra-tropical  low.  Action—OPC  will  check  for  user  feedback  before  any
changes are made.
Recommendation:  Improve  hurricane  local  statements  for  clear  headers,  place
most  important  sections  first,  do  not  repeat  the  TCP  advisory,  omit  sections  not
needed,  do  not  use  headline  ‘‘updated  Storm  Information,’’  and  the  HLS  does  not
need to have all sections. Will be Implemented for 2006 Hurricane Season.
Recommendation:  Make  the  HLS  a  segmented  product  in  time  for  the  2006  sea-
son.  Action—It  is  desired  for  HLSs  to  become  segmented  in  2006.  WFOs  have  the
option  to  produce  single-segmented  or  multi-segmented  HLS  products.  Eastern,
Southern and Pacific Regions will work with selected WFOs to provide examples of
both  formats.  Regions  and  WSH  will  seek  customer  input  regarding  segmented
HLSs.  Mark  Tew,  OS22,  will  work  with  software  developers  to  ascertain  the  level
of effort required for HLS segmentation, and provide a feasible implementation date
as soon as possible.
Recommendation: Require that ‘‘New Information’’ be the initial header in all but
the first HLS. Action—If used, ‘‘New Information’’ must be the initial section head-
er in the HLS.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

105

Recommendation: Allow the flexibility to shorten the HLS to include only the New
Information  header  for  life-threatening  events  within  six  hours  of  occurrence.  Ac-
tion—Will be Implemented for 2006 Hurricane Season.
Recommendation: Eliminate the requirement to include the entire CWA, for Flor-
ida  counties,  in  an  HLS  that  affects  a  small  portion  of  the  CWA.  Recommendation
from  OS21:  Rewrite  in  directive  10–601,  section  7.1.2.2  to  read  (changes  in  italics):
7.1.2.2  Issuance  Criteria.  The  following  WFOs  will  issue  HLSs  when  their  area  of
responsibility  is  affected  by  a  tropical  cyclone  watch/warning  or  evacuation  orders.
HLSs  may  also  be  issued  as  needed  to  dispel  rumors  or  to  clarify  tropical  cyclone
related information for their CWA. Coastal WFOs have the option to include inland
counties  in  the  HLS.  WFOs  also  have  the  option  to  include  or  not  include  coastal
and  inland  counties  not  affected  by  a  tropical  cyclone  watch  or  warning.  Action—
Change 7.1.2.2 to read: The following WFOs will issue HLSs when their zone areas
of  responsibility  are  affected  by  a  tropical  cyclone  watch/warning  or  evacuation  or-
ders.  HLSs  may  also  be  issued  as  needed  to  dispel  rumors  or  to  clarify  tropical  cy-
clone-related  information  for  their  CWA.  Coastal  WFOs  have  the  option  to  include
inland counties in the HLS. WFOs may exclude zones not affected by a tropical cy-
clone watch or warning.
Recommendation:  Require  impact  statements  for  both  NPW  and  HLS,  based  on
life-threatening impacts of wind, surge, or inland flood. Emphasize judicious use for
each  case.  For  wind,  the  lower  limit  should  be  sustained  Category  2  (96  mph  or
greater). Impacts for surge and inland flood may be locally defined. Action—WFOs
will have the option to include strongly-worded impact statements in NPW and HLS
products.  Judicious  use  is  recommended,  commensurate  with  the  threat,  to  ensure
the continued effectiveness of such statements.
Recommendation: Make improving tropical related GHG formatters by next hurri-
cane  season  a  top  priority.  Action—Recommendation  accepted.  OS21  will  forward
to  FSL.  FSL  to  ensure  function  to  capture  text  from  previous  HLS  works  correctly.
Recommendation:  Tropical  Storm/Hurricane  Wind  Impacts  should  be  base  lined
as  a  Cal  1To  Actions¥Tropical¥Overrides  file  in  future  IFPS  builds.  Action—Rec-
ommendation  accepted.  WFO  Slidell  will  forward  files  to  OS21.  OS21  will  forward
to FSL.
Recommendation:  Pursue  an  agency  effort  which  builds  upon  the  work  under-
taken at WFOs Miami and Melbourne to include enhanced wording within the ZFP
and  CWT  text  products  as  generated  by  the  GFE  formatter.  Action—Accepted.
Wind  Team  will  coordinate  the  experimental  use  of  probabilistic  wind  information
in the 2006 season. Team will make final Recommendations for the ZFP, CWT, and
PFM products.
Recommendation:  Provide  ‘Hurricane  Hotlines’  for  inland  office  commonly  im-
pacted  by  tropical  systems.  Action—SRH  will  submit  a  formal  letter  for  these  in-
land WFOs to OS21.
Recommendation: NWS  directives  need  to  better  define  areas  which  are  included
in  NHC  watches/warnings,  and  areas  which  are  considered  inland,  thereby  falling
under  the  realm  of  inland  tropical  cyclone  watches/warnings.  Action—OS21  will
form  a  team  with  representatives  from  Southern,  Eastern  and  Pacific  Regions,  and
TPC, to address this recommendation and the next, as well as associated issues.
Recommendation: To improve the delivery and clear communication of local WFO
tropical cyclone watch/warning information to customers in their area of warning re-
sponsibility,  change  the  headline  in  segmented,  VTEC  ready,  NPW  products  for
coastal  zones.  This  improvement  would  extend  to  all  local  WFO  issued  NPWs  for
tropical  storm/hurricane  watches  and  warnings  that  affect  coastal  zones.  Action—
See previous item.
Recommendation:  The  NHC  should  provide  appropriate  error  cone  radius  num-
bers for each forecast time on TCM and possibly TCD products. Also, NWS tropical
web sections (WFOs, NHC, Regional and National HQ, etc.) need to include a good,
concise definition and explanation of the error cone and how it should be used. This
explanation  should  be  non-technical  and  geared  more  toward  the  public  and  EMC.
Action—TPC/NHC  will  modify  their  web  page  text  description  to  include  average
error values and a better definition of the cone of uncertainty.
Recommendation:  TPC  should  produce  an  internal  pre-TCM  flat  file  just  before
conference call time. This file would only be available to WFOs and would give them
an  hour  lead  time  on  producing  wind  grids.  If  necessary,  WFOs  can  run  the

106

TCMwind  tool  if  there  are  changes  between  the  preliminary  pre-TCM  flat  file  and
the  final  version  of  the  TPC  Tropical  Cyclone  Marine  Forecast.  Action—At  con-
ference  call  time,  this  forecast  information  is  typically  available  only  in  hard  copy
form  on  an  advisory  composition  worksheet.  TPC/NHC  will  investigate  the  possi-
bility  of  using  an  electronic  tablet  to  produce  this  worksheet,  so  that  a  file  con-
taining the information can be transmitted to the WFOs and the DOD, when avail-
able.
Recommendation:  A  simple  solution  to  ‘‘retiring’’  Greek  Alphabet  names,  if  nec-
essary,  is  to  have  a  floating  alternate  or  secondary  name  list  available  that  could
be  placed  into  service  if  the  primary  Atlantic  Cyclone  name  list  is  exhausted.
Named  storms  from  the  secondary  or  alternate  list  that  require  retirement  could
easily  be  replenished  based  on  Recommendations  from  the  WMO.  Action—Rec-
ommendation  accepted.  Will  be  proposed  at  the  upcoming  WMO  RA–IV  hurricane
Committee meeting.
Recommendation:  Add  Pacific  Region  ASOS  sites  to  be  considered  for  backup
power.  Action—Pacific  Region  will  forward  a  list  of  ASOS  sites  for  consideration
in this initiative.
Recommendation:  Forward  to  IHC  to  request  action  completed  by  CARCAH,
USAF 53rd WRS and NOAA AOC prior to start of 2006 hurricane season. Action—
Recommendations accepted. Will be forwarded to IHC.
Recommendation:  Forward  to  IHC  to  request  action  by  Air  Force  prior  to  start
of  2006  hurricane  season.  For  TP..10  KGWC  WMO  Fix  Message.  Action—Rec-
ommendation Accepted.
Recommendation:  Obtain  input  from  the  coastal  forecast  offices,  and  deliver  re-
vised plan prior to start of 2006 hurricane season. Action—Recommendation accept-
ed.
Recommendation: Change Subtropical Cyclone Definition in Operational Manuals.
Action—Recommendation  Accepted.  Forward  to  IHC  and  WMO  RA–IV  Hurricane
Committee.
Recommendation: Standardize Post-Tropical Cyclone Reports:

1) In all issuances of the PSH, follow the existing format in Instruction 10–601
unless and until the format is revised, in particular providing only wind ob-
servations with at least gusts of 34 kts or greater, wind speeds in kts, times
in UTC, anemometer heights, and sustained wind speed averaging durations.
2) Create  a  team  of  TPC,  WFO,  and  NWS  Headquarters  personnel  to  agree
upon  the  format  of  a  more  standardized  PSH  and  to  recommend  procedures
and/or any software enhancements needed to compose the product in the new
format.  This  could  be  similar  to  how  WFOs  input  Local  Storm  Reports  into
AWIPS.  Recommended  standardizations  for  the  team  to  consider  would  in-
clude but are not necessarily limited to the following:
a. Standardize  the  placement  of  key  data  values,  more  specifically  than
just the order of major sections, to facilitate automated parsing and con-
version of the PSH product for multiple uses.

b. If  an  instrument  failed  during  the  event,  or  if  data  is  otherwise  incom-
plete,  specify  the  time  of  the  last  available  observation  and  the  reason
for the data outage (e.g., power failure, storm surge, capsized).

c. For unofficial and/or mobile observation sources, provide the latitude and

longitude of the listed observation, if available.

3) Determine  if  it  is  possible  for  the  National  Data  Buoy  Center  (NDBC)  to
issue a PSH product or otherwise produce a text product in the same format
as the PSH. The product would include similar information in the same for-
mat as WFO-issued PSHs for each NDBC site with observed data satisfying
the same wind and/or pressure threshold criteria during the tropical cyclone
event.

Action—Recommendation  (1)  is  already  covered  by  existing  policy.  Recommenda-

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Max  Mayfield,  Director,  NOAA  Tropical  Prediction  Center/National

Hurricane Center

Questions submitted by the Majority
Q1. In  your  testimony  you  explained  that  while  progress  has  been  made  forecasting
hurricane  tracks,  there  is  much  room  for  improvement  in  forecasting  hurricane
intensity. Non-governmental experts have suggested that the Federal Government
could improve its ability to forecast hurricane intensity by conducting additional
observations  and  research.  Some  of  the  additional  activities  suggested  by  these
experts include:

Q1a. Hurricane  observation  flights  in  the  upper  troposphere  (current  flights  do  not

go to that altitude);

Q1b. Improved  numerical  prediction  models  that  include  both  ocean  and  atmos-

pheric observations; and

Q1c. More or improved observations of hurricane cores.

Do  you  agree  that  conducting  the  additional  observations/research  listed  above
would  likely  lead  to  an  improved  ability  to  forecast  hurricane  intensity  in  the
short-term and/or in the long-term? If not, why not?

A1a,b,c. Currently  NOAA  is  pursuing  all  three  of  these  activities  to  improve  fore-
casts of hurricane intensity and structure.

• The  NOAA  Gulfstream-IV  aircraft  operates  a  high  altitude  sampling  of  the
upper troposphere surrounding hurricanes as part of operational surveillance
missions.  We  are  also  conducting  special  research  flights  into  the  inner  por-
tion  of  hurricanes  including  the  upper  regions  in  the  eye  of  the  hurricane.
NOAA  has  partnered  with  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administra-
tion  (NASA)  on  three  experiments  over  the  past  seven  years,  the  latest  con-
ducted  this  past  summer,  to  obtain  high  altitude  aircraft  observations  of  the
inner core of a number of hurricanes and tropical storms from the NASA DC–
8 and ER–2 aircraft. These observations, combined with those from the NOAA
P–3 aircraft, have provided numerous insights into storm intensity and struc-
ture.
• NOAA currently is developing a next generation hurricane prediction system,
the  Hurricane  Weather  and  Research  Forecasting  system.  The  Hurricane
Weather and Research Forecasting system consists of (1) advanced high-qual-
ity  observations  for  both  atmosphere  and  ocean;  (2)  advanced  data  assimila-
tion  techniques;  and  (3)  the  next  generation,  coupled  air-sea-land  prediction
system  with  advanced  representation  of  physical  processes.  This  model  is  in
the testing stage with implementation planned for 2007.
• The  NOAA  P–3  aircraft  operate  in  the  core  of  the  hurricane  at  altitudes  be-
tween  1,000–20,000  feet.  These  aircraft  have  been  used  since  1976  to  collect
research  and  operational  data  sets  to  improve  our  forecasts  and  under-
standing of tropical cyclone track, intensity, and structure. As a result of this
research,  a  number  of  new  technologies,  sampling  strategies,  and  concepts
have  been  transitioned  to  operational  use.  The  most  recent  of  these  is  the
Stepped  Frequency  Microwave  Radiometer  (SFMR),  which  provides  surface
wind  estimates  that  are  a  direct  measure  of  the  storm  structure  and  inten-
sity.  We  are  in  the  midst  of  transferring  a  new  technology  into  operations,
the  airborne  Doppler  radar,  for  use  in  initializing  and  evaluating  the  new
operational modeling system.

Q2. In  your  opinion,  what  other  areas  of  additional  research  or  observations  are
needed  to  help  understand  and  forecast  hurricane  intensity  in  the  short-term
and in the long-term?

A2. Investing  wisely  in  science  and  technology  is  the  prudent  approach  toward  im-
proving  hurricane  understanding  and  prediction.  Observations  and  research  are  es-
sential  for  developing  advanced  operational  numerical  systems.  Research  and  oper-
ations  are  linked  to  achieve  improved  understanding  and  prediction  of  hurricanes.
Requirements to better understand and forecast hurricane intensity include numer-
ical weather prediction model guidance of high resolution derived from cutting edge
science  and  advanced  data  assimilation,  as  well  as  a  real-time  observing  network
of  greater  resolution  and  reliability,  especially  over  ocean  areas  for  forecaster  anal-

ysis  and  short-term  forecasts.  The  FY  2006  hurricane  supplemental  request  in-
cluded over $31M in new investments to improve hurricane warnings and forecasts.
Ocean  observations  will  be  expanded  by  deploying  8  new  buoys  and  re-engineering
dropwindsones.  The  completion  of  the  new  Hurricane  Weather  and  Research  Fore-
casting System (HWRF) will be accelerated. The Global Forecast System (GFS) will
be  enhanced  to  improve  forecasts  of  hurricane  intensity  (strength)  and  structure
(size).
Q3. In  your  opinion,  what  are  the  five  highest  priority  areas  of  additional  research
or  observations  needed  to  improve  hurricane  intensity  forecasts  and  models  in
the  short-term?  Similarly,  what  are  the  five  highest  priority  areas  to  improve
this  capability  in  the  long-term?  What  are  the  estimated  costs  of  implementing
theses priority areas? Why has NOAA not implemented research or observations
in these areas? Are there plans to move ahead with these activities?

A3. NOAA  is  working  to  address  its  five  highest  priority  areas  for  both  short-  and
long-term research and observations needed to improve hurricane intensity forecasts
and models. These areas include:

1. Increase  computational  capacity  to  run  sophisticated  high  resolution  numer-

ical weather prediction models.

2. Research  for  more  detailed  representation  of  small  scale  features  in  hurri-

canes and coupling of the wave and hurricane prediction models.

3. Expand the current network of coastal and deep-ocean buoys.
4. Develop and deploy satellite sensors on NOAA geostationary and polar-orbit-
ing  satellites  that  would  significantly  improve  wind  force  and  vector  meas-
urements of hurricanes and severe storms.

5. Add  additional  flight  hours  for  the  high  altitude  NOAA  Gulfstream-IV  air-

craft.

Hurricane modeling is necessary for studying storm dynamics and for forecasting
hurricane  track,  strength,  and  intensification.  One  of  the  limiting  factors  in  hurri-
cane  modeling  in  both  the  short-  and  long-term  is  computational  power.  The  devel-
opment  of  higher  resolution  models  that  provide  more  detailed  representations  of
hurricanes is dependent on having the computational power to run these higher res-
olution models.

While  the  above  list  of  priorities  includes  both  short-  and  long-term  research
goals,  additional  efforts  in  the  long-term  need  to  focus  research  on:  the  effect  of
upper  ocean  processes  on  hurricane  intensity  and  structure;  the  role  the  atmos-
pheric  environment  plays  in  hurricane  intensity  and  structure  change  (e.g.,  how
very low humidity in the lower troposphere or very strong vertical shear of the hori-
zontal wind affect hurricane intensity and structure); improving observations of the
inner  core  (eyewall)  processes;  the  role  of  rain  bands  in  hurricane  intensity  and
structure  change;  and  developing  and  testing  of  new  advanced  models  that  (1)  pro-
vide a more detailed representation of the inner-core dynamics of the storm and the
interactions  between  the  storm  with  its  environment  and  (2)  provide  an  optimal
forecast framework to help quantify the uncertainty in the forecasts.

Through the Joint Hurricane Testbed, funded primarily through the U.S. Weather
Research  Program,  the  National  Hurricane  Center  has  devoted  considerable  time
identifying the most pressing needs and priorities. A complete list of program prior-
ities

Sufficient resources for operations, research and observations have been provided.
We  strive  to  continue  to  improve  our  products  and  services,  particularly  hurricane
intensity forecasting. NOAA continues to implement research to operations and pro-
gramming,  planning  and  budgeting  activities  have  identified  and  include  the  nec-
essary  resources  to  keep  up  with  this  demand.  We  appreciate  your  continued  sup-
port of the President’s annual budget requests.
Q4. In developing a hurricane forecast, you use weather data collected from a variety
of  sources,  including  NOAA  satellites,  radar,  buoys,  hurricane  hunters,  etc.  For
each  of  these  sources  of  weather  data,  please  briefly  describe  the  nature  of  the
data  you  receive  and  what  role  it  plays  in  developing  a  hurricane  forecast.  In
addition,  please  identify  any  weather  data  that  is  currently  available  to  you
from only one source.

AIRCRAFT:
NOAA Gulfstream-IV

110

Deploys  dropwindsondes,  which  measure  pressure,  wind  speed,  wind  direction,
temperature  and  dew  point,  providing  a  vertical  atmospheric  profile  from  wherever
it  is  dropped  by  aircraft  to  sea  surface.  Data  are  used  to  increase  accuracy  in  nu-
merical model predictions.
NOAA P–3

Deploys dropwindosondes; provides radar images, visual report of sea surface and
estimated  surface  winds,  center  position  and  pressure,  wind  radii  and  maximum
winds/intensity; Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) provides surface
wind  data;  Expendable  Bathythermograph  (XBT)  provides  ocean  temperature  pro-
files. Some data is used by the forecasters, in numerical model predictions, and used
extensively for research activities to increase accuracy and improve physical under-
standing  of  ocean  and  marine  interface.  NOAA  operates  two  P–3  aircraft,  and  will
purchase a third with funding from the FY06 hurricane supplemental.
U.S. Air Force Reserve C130–J

Deploys dropwindsondes; provides visual report of sea surface and estimated sur-
face  winds,  center  position  and  pressure,  wind  radii  and  maximum  winds/intensity.
Data is used by numerical models as well as forecasters. The Military Construction
Appropriations  and  Emergency  Hurricane  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act,  2005
(P.L.  108–324)  provided  the  U.S.  Air  Force  $10.5M  to  install  SFMRs  on  its  fleet  of
10 C130–J aircraft.

SATELLITES:
GOES—Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites

Primary  data  is  provided  by  GOES–10,  GOES–12,  and  METEOSAT–7  (VIS,  IR,
WV  every  15–30  min).  Interpretation  of  the  satellite  data  provides  a  classification
and analysis of the tropical system and helps determine the center of the storm and
its intensity. Images, or ‘‘pictures,’’ from GOES allow everyone to see what the hur-
ricane looks like. It is these images that track the storms and are what is so promi-
nently shown by the media.
POES—Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite

NOAA Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) with the advanced micro-
wave  sounding  unit  (AMSU)  and  the  advanced  very  high  radiometer  (AVHRR)  pro-
vide:  precipitation  estimates,  qualitative  estimates  of  storm  intensity  trends,  sea
surface  temperatures,  storm  center  position,  convective  structure  and  atmospheric
temperature/humidity profiles.

Note:  POES  are  not  always  over  the  storm  since  these  satellites  orbit  the  globe;

this is in contrast to the GOES which are stationary relative to Earth surface.
Other Low-Earth Orbiting Satellites

• The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, using the special sensor micro-
wave/imagery (SSMI) suite of instruments, provides information on ocean sur-
face  wind  speed,  precipitation,  sea  surface  temperatures,  center  position  and
convective structure.

• The  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration’s  (NASA’s)  Tropical
Rainfall  Mapping  Mission  (TRMM)  satellites,  using  the  TRMM  microwave
imager  (TMI),  provide  precipitation/rain  rate,  center  position,  convective
structure, ocean surface wind speed and sea surface temperatures.

• NASA’s  OuikSCAT,  using  the  SeaWinds  scatterometer,  provides  wind  speed,

wind direction, center location and wind radii.

• The  NASA  AQUA  satellite  mission  uses  the  moderate  resolution  imaging
spectroradiometer,  the  advanced  microwave  scanning  radiometer  and  the  at-
mospheric  infrared  sounder  to  provide  precipitable  water,  water  vapor,  sea
surface  temperatures,  center  position,  convective  structure  and  atmospheric
temperature/humidity profiles.

• European Research Satellite (ERS–2), using a wind scatterometer and a radar
altimeter,  provides  the  National  Weather  Service  with  wind  speed  and  direc-
tion, storm center location, wind radii and wave heights.

RADAR:

U.S. WSR–88D—Doppler NEXRAD network provides extensive data as the storm
approaches  land.  Wind  speed  data  is  available  within  125  miles  of  the  coast  and
conventional reflectivity data is available out to 250 miles away from the radar.
UPPER AIR OBSERVATIONS:

Observations  from  soundings  of  the  atmosphere  are  available  from  10  U.S.  sta-
tions along the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico. These observations (taken twice per day
or  every  six  hours  when  a  hurricane  is  approaching  land)  provide  temperature,
moisture, wind speed and direction from the Earth’s surface to as high as 10 miles.
Data is also available from other countries in the region covering Central and South
America  and  the  Caribbean  nations,  although  this  data  is  not  available  as  consist-
ently as data collected from U.S. sites.
BUOYS:
Drifting

Drifting  buoys  provide  sea  surface  temperature  and  some  wind  speed  and  direc-

tion data.
Moored

Moored  buoys  provide  wind  speed  and  direction,  air  and  sea  temperature,  baro-
metric  pressure,  and  wave  height;  and  the  newer  buoys  provide  wave  direction.
These buoys provide coverage for the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Atlan-
tic  Coast.  Specifically,  NOAA  operates  and  maintains  12  moored  weather  buoys  in
the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  three  in  the  Caribbean,  and  14  along  the  Atlantic  Coast  from
Florida to New York, all critical to the Atlantic hurricane program. Forecasters use
data from moored buoys operated and maintained by other federal, State, local and
private entities as well.
LAND-BASED SURFACE OBSERVING EQUIPMENT:
Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)

This  system  measures  temperature,  wind  speed/direction,  precipitation,  present

weather, cloud height, visibility, and barometric pressure.
Private sector wind portable wind towers

These  are  portable  towers,  mostly  deployed  by  universities  involved  in  hurricane
research  efforts.  These  data  are  used  in  post-storm  analysis.  Data  are  usually  tem-
perature, wind speed/direction, precipitation, present weather, and barometric pres-
sure.
OIL PLATFORM OBSERVATION STATIONS:

Oil  platform  observation  stations  can  provide  data  on  temperature,  wind  speed/

direction, precipitation, and surface pressure.
SHIPS:

Data  collected  on  ships  can  include  temperature,  wind  speed/direction,  wave

height, precipitation, present weather, cloud height, visibility, and pressure.
TIDE GAUGES:

Tide gauges provide information on the level/height of the water. This information

is most useful for observing, not forecasting, storm surge.
C–MAN:

C–MAN  stations  provide  data  on  barometric  pressure,  wind  direction,  speed  and
gust, and air temperature. Some C–MAN stations are designed to also measure sea
water  temperature,  water  level,  waves,  relative  humidity,  precipitation,  and  visi-
bility.
COMPUTER MODELS:

The National Hurricane Center relies extensively on computer model output from
various  numerical  weather  prediction  centers.  These  data  provide  guidance  on  the
future  track  and  intensity  of  tropical  cyclones.  Other  computer  models  used  by  the
National  Hurricane  Center  help  predict  potential  storm  surge  the  storms  could
produce.

While  some  sources  of  data  are  unique,  NOAA  has  backup  or  contingency  plans
in place to continue the stream of essential data. For example, there is overlapping
WSR–88D (NEXRAD) radar coverage—if one goes down, data is provided by an ad-
jacent  site;  newer  models  of  data  buoys  have  redundant  sensors;  and  NOAA  uses

FAA Terminal Doppler Radar data at coastal sites where data are available to pro-
vide another layer of backup information.
Q5. If  data  from  polar-orbiting  weather  satellites  was  not  available  to  you,  how

would that affect your ability to forecast hurricanes?

A5. Data  from  polar-orbiting  weather  satellites  provides  information  essential  to
computer  model  forecasts.  This  data  is  the  only  source  that  provides  information
from over the oceans. Internal studies show that lack of polar-orbiting satellite data
would  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  forecasts,  potentially  reducing  forecast  accu-
racy by 15–20 percent.
Q6. If  NOAA  had  a  second  Gulfstream  jet  for  studying  hurricanes,  what  improve-
ments  could  be  made  to  NOAA’s  hurricane  forecasting  capability?  How  long
would  it  be  before  those  improvements  could  be  incorporated  into  operational
prediction  models?  How  much  would  it  cost  to  procure  a  second  jet  and  what
funding would be required for annual operating costs for a second jet?

A6. NOAA routinely operates the Gulfstream-IV (G–IV) aircraft twice a day on suc-
cessive  8.5  hour  missions  during  hurricane  season.  Internal  studies  show  data  pro-
vided  by  the  current  Gulfstream-IV  jet  have  improved  track  prediction  by  about  20
percent,  primarily  during  the  hurricane  watch/warning  phase  (when  the  storm  is
within a day or two of landfall). A second jet would allow more missions to be flown.
This  could  be  valuable  during  an  active  hurricane  season  when  numerous  hurri-
canes threaten the United States and data from nearly continuous flights would im-
prove predictions.

A  new  Gulfstream  jet,  complete  with  essential  equipment,  would  cost  approxi-
mately $80 million, assuming the aircraft is purchased under an existing Air Force
contract.  We  estimate  that  it  would  cost  $5  million  per  year  in  operating  costs  for
crew, maintenance, dropwindsondes and fuel.

Any  single  observational  platform  needs  to  be  put  into  the  proper  context  with
all  other  investments  in  observations.  Currently  the  most  important  observations
needed to improve hurricane intensity and structure forecasts come from the radars
flown  on  NOAA’s  P–3s.  The  U.S.  Air  Force  will  use  funds  from  the  FY  2005  hurri-
cane  supplemental  to  install  these  Stepped  Frequency  Microwave  Radiometer  sen-
sors  on  its  fleet  of  10  aircraft,  the  first  of  which  will  be  available  late  in  FY  2006.
The  FY  2006  hurricane  funding  supplemental  provided  $9M  for  an  additional,
equipped P–3 aircraft to improve observations of hurricanes.
Q7. You have stated that today’s average hurricane track forecast errors are only 94
nautical  miles,  compared  with  average  forecast  errors  of  230  nautical  miles  in
1987. Have we reached the theoretical limit of track forecasting with the 94 nau-
tical miles error, or could that error become smaller? If the error could be made
smaller, what resources (i.e., observing equipment, computers, research funding,
etc.)  does  NOAA  need  to  improve  track  forecasting  and  what  is  the  estimated
cost of those resources?

A7. While  we  may  be  nearing  the  theoretical  limit  of  track  prediction,  we  continue
to  work  to  improve  our  track  forecasts.  Track  predictability  depends  on  being  able
to  predict  larger  scale  atmospheric  conditions  and,  on  average,  we  have  been  suc-
cessful  at  predicting  the  features  that  ‘‘steer’’  the  hurricane.  However,  storms  like
Wilma  (when  it  was  in  the  southern  Caribbean)  and  Ophelia  (when  stationary  off
the  coast  of  Florida)  highlight  that  we  have  room  for  improvement  when  it  comes
to predicting tracks for the ‘‘outlier’’ storms that stall or take very erratic paths.

To  improve  track  forecasts  we  must  continue  our  research  efforts  and  computer
modeling  development.  NOAA  is  currently  developing  a  next  generation  hurricane
prediction  system,  the  Hurricane  Weather  and  Research  Forecasting  (HWRF)  sys-
tem.  We  expect  the  improvements  embodied  in  the  HWRF  system  will  lead  to  re-
duced  track  forecast  error.  Funding  provided  in  the  FY  2006  hurricane  supple-
mental will accelerate the completion of the HWRF system. Additional observations,
such  as  those  planned  under  the  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems
(GEOSS), would also help in defining the conditions for hurricane predictions.
Q8. A recent article in the Miami Herald asserts that key countries in the Caribbean
are  not  launching  weather  balloons  regularly,  despite  an  agreement  with  the
United  States  to  launch  balloons,  because  the  countries  did  not  have  all  the
equipment  the  U.S.  had  promised.  Would  additional  funding  or  other  actions
help  ensure  that  weather  balloon  equipment  is  provided  to  Caribbean  countries
in a timely manner and that the countries launch the balloons as needed?

A8. We  face  many  different  challenges  when  collecting  meteorological  data.  All  re-
quired  equipment  and  supplies  have  been  provided  to  the  appropriate  countries,  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:47 Jul 08, 2006 Jkt 023331 PO 00000 Frm 00116 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\100705\23331 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

accordance  with  our  agreements.  During  Hurricane  Wilma,  four  of  the  sites  experi-
enced system malfunctions (hydrogen generator and/or tracking system), which have
now been corrected. Releasing weather balloons, using the tracking equipment, and
transmitting data back to the international data collection hubs is the responsibility
of  each  country.  Issues  such  as  local  power,  communications,  and  maintenance  are
challenges  that  vary  from  country  to  country,  which  has  at  times  made  it  difficult
to collect meteorological data from balloon launches. While these data are important
and  NOAA  will  do  all  it  can  to  ensure  the  data  are  available,  dropwindsonde  data
from hurricane reconnaissance flights provide similar types of data used by our hur-
ricane forecasters and hurricane models.
Q9. In  your  opinion,  if  additional  funding  were  available  for  hurricane  forecasting,
what are the five highest priority areas of where additional resources would im-
prove operational hurricane forecasts and models?

A9. The  highest  priority  for  hurricane  forecasting  is  to  improve  our  prediction  of
storm intensity. There are many components accompanying that element, including
continued  improvements  in  track  forecasts  and  the  prediction  of  the  size  of  the
windfield, as well as being able to predict when and how quickly storms will inten-
sify and how strong they will become. Additionally, we need to develop a better un-
derstanding  of  the  uncertainty  associated  with  our  forecasts  of  storm  intensity  (in
particular rapid intensification of storms), as well as storm structure/size. These pri-
orities  can  be  addressed  through  continued  research,  increased  development  of  our
next  generation  operational  hurricane  models,  and  additional  observations,  such  as
those  planned  under  the  Global  Environmental  Observing  System  of  Systems
(GEOSS).  With  funding  provided  in  the  FY  2006  appropriation,  we  will  add  four
new hurricane forecasters, who will also enhance operational hurricane forecasts.

Additional  priorities  are  provided  in  Joint  Hurricane  Testbed  Announcement  of

Q10. What  is  the  difference  between  data  received  from  hurricane  reconnaissance
flights in NOAA’s Gulfstream jet, NOAA’s P–3 Orions, and the Air Force’s WC–
130  cargo  planes?  What  factors  determine  which  aircraft  is  flown  to  observe  a
storm? What factors determine how frequently flights are made with each type
of aircraft?

A10. The  Gulfstream-IV  jet  is  used  to  obtain  data  from  the  environment  sur-
rounding  the  hurricane.  These  data  are  then  assimilated  into  NOAA’s  operational
forecast  system  to  better  define  the  atmospheric  conditions  and  steering  currents
that  influence  the  future  track  of  the  hurricane.  The  data  collected  by  the  Gulf-
stream are also used to help forecasters identify general conditions for storm inten-
sification.

In  contrast,  the  P–3s  and  the  WC–130s  provide  data  from  inside  the  hurricane,
including  windspeed,  and  hurricane  eye  positions,  among  other  vital  information.
The P–3s are equipped with research instruments to help NOAA and other research
scientists  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  inner  workings  of  hurricanes  and
help  to  develop  improved  forecast  capabilities,  including  hurricane  intensity  fore-
casts  predictions.  The  P–3s  also  serve  as  platforms  for  testing  new  observing  tech-
nologies,  such  as  the  Stepped  Frequency  Microwave  Radiometer  (SFMR),  which
measures  over-ocean  wind  speed  and  rain  rate,  and  Global  Positioning  System
(GPS) dropsondes.

As  outlined  in  the  National  Hurricane  Operations  Plan  (NHOP),  the  National
Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  requests  aircraft  reconnaissance  data  through  the  Chief,
Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH). The CARCAH then
allocates reconnaissance missions among the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command and
NOAA as appropriate. Typically, most missions are carried out by the U.S. Air Force
Reserve Command.
Q11. Do  other  missions  for  NOAA’s  P–3  Orions,  such  as  air  quality  research,  inter-
fere with the National Hurricane Center’s hurricane forecasting capabilities? If
not, why not?

A11. Flight  hours  for  the  P–3  Orions  are  assigned  in  accordance  with  NOAA’s  Ma-
rine  and  Aviation  Operations  Allocation  Plan  and  coordinated  by  NOAA’s  Aircraft
Operations  Center.  In  situations  when  there  are  competing  requests  for  P–3  usage,
the  National  Hurricane  Center  has  priority  access  to  the  P–3  flights  for  hurricane
reconnaissance.  In  many  cases  we  are  able  to  conduct  hurricane  research  on  these
reconnaissance flights. Additionally, non-hurricane research missions typically occur
in areas that would allow the P–3s to be recalled to MacDill AFB within the range
of  one  flight,  so  they  could  be  redirected  to  conduct  hurricane  reconnaissance  if

needed. Further, the non-hurricane research missions are usually flown in the early
part of hurricane season, to reduce the number of competing requests for P–3 flight
time during the more active portion of the hurricane season. The FY 2006 hurricane
supplemental  provides  NOAA  with  an  additional  P–3  aircraft;  this  should  help  en-
sure adequate coverage.

United  States  Air  Force  Reserves’  53rd  Weather  Reconnaissance  Squadron  main-
tains  and  operates  a  fleet  of  10  C130–J  aircraft  to  conduct  most  hurricane  recon-
naissance missions and provide storm location and data, including hurricane inten-
sity.  The  Air  Force  will  use  funding  from  the  Military  Construction  Appropriations
and Emergency Hurricane Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108–324) to
outfit  its  ‘‘Hurricane  Hunter’’  aircraft  with  Stepped  Frequency  Microwave  Radiom-
eter  sensors  beginning  in  late  FY  2006.  SFMR  provides  meteorologists  with  critical
data  on  the  hurricane  surface  wind  field,  and  in  particular  the  estimation  of  wind
maxima,  which  has  long  been  a  requirement  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center/Na-
tional Hurricane Center (TPC/NHC).
Q12. Recent  articles  in  the  Miami  Herald  assert  that  ‘‘in  2004  before  Hurricane
Charley. . .weather balloon readings were missing from countries all along its
path,  leaving  hundreds  of  miles  of  the  atmosphere  unmonitored.. . .Three
coastal  weather-observing  stations  between  the  Florida  Keys  and  northwest
Florida  were  malfunctioning,  denying  forecasters  clues  about  ocean  tempera-
ture and wind speed.’’ Is this assertion true and if so, why was this observation
data  unavailable?  Also,  if  the  assertion  is  true,  what  was  the  impact  on  fore-
casting Hurricane Charley?

A12. We  have  encountered  some  difficulties  in  obtaining  weather  balloon  releases
within  the  Caribbean  region  from  the  countries  with  which  the  United  States  has
agreements  due  to  issues  such  as  local  power,  communications,  and  maintenance.
These problems are being addressed. However, because there was nearly continuous
aircraft reconnaissance during Hurricane Charley, we do not believe the lack of data
from these sites impacted our forecasts. Our records indicate only one NOAA buoys
or  Coastal-Marine  Automated  Network  (C–MAN)  sites  was  out  of  service  prior  to
the  passage  of  Hurricane  Charley.  We  believe  lack  of  data  from  this  one  site  did
not impact our forecasts.

Questions submitted by the Minority
Q1. What  role  do  the  local  offices  play  in  distributing  and  refining  the  forecast  for
the hurricane prior to the storm and during the storm versus the role of the Hur-
ricane Center?

A1. Local  Weather  Forecast  Offices  (WFOs)  play  an  important  role  by  providing
more  detailed  forecasts  for  their  area  of  responsibility.  For  example,  the  National
Hurricane  Center  provides  a  broad  range  of  values  in  its  storm  surge  predictions;
the  WFOs  refine  those  storm  surge  predictions  by  identifying  vulnerable  areas  and
associating  particular  values  for  the  surge  in  those  areas.  Local  WFOs  also  refine
the  timing  of  the  onset  of  hurricane  conditions  in  their  area,  including  information
on  wind  speed,  storm  surge,  rainfall  amounts  and  the  potential  for  tornadoes.  The
WFOs also coordinate with and brief local emergency managers to ensure the man-
agers  have  the  latest  information  available  to  make  their  preparedness  and  evacu-
ation decisions.
Q2. The Hurricane Center participates in workshops and conferences after the hurri-
cane season with FEMA and State and local emergency managers and other or-
ganizations.  Does  staff  of  the  local  forecast  offices  also  participate  in  these
offseason  activities?  Why  are  multiple  annual  workshops  useful  in  maintaining
skills in preparation and response for hurricanes?

A2. Time  and  resources  permitting,  local  weather  forecast  offices  participate  in
workshops  and  conferences.  Multiple  workshops  provide  the  opportunity  to  train
more  individuals  than  a  single  training  session.  Our  workshops  are  coordinated,  to
the  greatest  extent  possible,  to  allow  emergency  managers  and  National  Weather
Service (NWS) forecasters from the same local area to attend the same session. This
creates  a  favorable  learning  environment,  and  builds/enhances  relationships  in
those  local  areas.  Beginning  in  2006,  in  partnership  with  the  Federal  Emergency
Management  Agency,  local  weather  forecast  offices  will  participate  in  training  ses-
sions  for  emergency  managers  on  how  to  use  NWS  products  and  how  to  interpret
and  understand  NWS  predictions  of  storm  surge.  The  emergency  managers  receiv-
ing  this  training  will  then  return  to  their  offices,  where  they  will  train  their  co-

workers  and  other  local  officials.  This  method  of  training  allows  for  efficient  use  of
funding and allows us to reach more local officials than possible otherwise.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. How  would  you  characterize  the  participation  by  State  and  local  emergency

managers in the Hurricane Liaison Team conference calls?
The HLT process has been used for a long time now. Would you say this process
has  provided  a  good  forum  for  information  exchange  between  the  various  levels
of government?
I  understand  the  Hurricane  Center  participates  in  a  series  of  workshops  and
conferences  after  the  end  of  the  hurricane  season.  How  would  you  characterize
the feedback regarding the HLT process in the post-hurricane season from State
and local government people?

A1. The  Hurricane  Liaison  Team  (HLT)  conference  calls  serve  as  an  excellent  co-
ordination tool and an efficient use of time. State emergency managers from poten-
tially impacted locations participate on the call listening to the weather briefing and
then  coordinating  emergency  management  activities.  The  HLT  briefings  provide  an
excellent  forum  for  the  National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  to  share  meteorological
information  with  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA)  and  State
Emergency  Operations  Centers,  and  also  for  the  NHC  to  understand  the  concerns
of  emergency  managers.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  has  received  positive  feed-
back  in  its  participation  in  the  Hurricane  Liaison  Team,  from  workshops,  the  Na-
tional Hurricane Conference, and State hurricane conferences.

The NHC is an invited participant in the HLT video teleconference briefings facili-
tated by FEMA. In addition to the NHC, FEMA typically includes State emergency
operations centers from the potential impact areas and regional FEMA offices on the
HLT briefings. The HLT briefings do not usually include local emergency managers.
Local  emergency  managers  have  access  to  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  warn-
ings  distributed  through  a  vast  dissemination  network  including  NOAA  Weather
Radio  All  Hazards  (NWR);  NOAA  Weather  Wire  Service;  Emergency  Managers
Weather  Information  Network  (EMWIN);  Internet;  local  paging  systems  to  emer-
gency  managers;  high-speed  direct  communications  with  users  of  large  volumes  of
weather  data  (i.e.,  commercial  meteorological  firms)  connected  by  landlines  (Family
of Services), by satellite broadcasts (NOAAPORT), or both. In addition there is close
coordination  that  occurs  between  the  National  Weather  Service  Weather  Forecast
Offices and local emergency managers.
