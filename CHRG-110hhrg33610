2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Wednesday, March 7, 2007 the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the
House  Science  and  Technology  Committee  will  hold  a  hearing  on  the  Department
of  Energy’s  (DOE)  fiscal  year  2008  Budget  Request  for  research  and  development
programs.
Witnesses
Dr. Ray Orbach is the Under Secretary for Science at DOE, where he has directed
the Office of Science since 2002. Prior to joining the Department, Dr. Orbach served
as Chancellor of the University of California at Riverside.
Mr. Dennis Spurgeon is the Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy at DOE. Mr.
Spurgeon was recently designated as the Acting Under Secretary for Energy, taking
the place of David Garman.
Mr.  Alexander  Karsner  is  the  Assistant  Secretary  for  Energy  Efficiency  and  Re-
newable Energy at DOE. Previously, Mr. Karsner served in the private sector as an
international  infrastructure  developer  and  entrepreneur  in  a  wide  range  of  energy
technology fields.
Mr. Kevin Kolevar is the Director of the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy
Reliability  at  DOE.  Prior  to  his  appointment  Mr.  Kolevar  served  as  Chief  of  Staff
to then-Deputy of Energy Kyle McSlarrow.
Mr.  Thomas  D.  Shope  is  the  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Fossil  En-
ergy.  Mr.  Shope  is  testifying  in  place  of  Assistant  Secretary  Jeffrey  Jarrett  who  re-
cently announced his resignation.

The $7.2 billion request for DOE civilian energy R&D funding in FY08 is divided
among the five offices represented at this hearing. The Office of Science (SC) funds
basic research at universities and 10 national laboratories, and is the single largest
federal  supporter  of  physical  sciences  research.  The  other  four  offices  focus  on  ap-
plied research and technology development in the fields of Energy Efficiency and Re-

newable Energy, Fossil Energy, Nuclear Energy, and Electricity Delivery. Appearing
for the first time in the President’s budget is the Innovative Technology Loan Guar-
antee  Program  which  would  provide  loan  guarantees  for  advanced  technology
projects  that  avoid,  reduce,  or  sequester  air  pollutants  or  anthropogenic  emissions
of  greenhouse  gases,  and  have  a  reasonable  prospect  of  repaying  the  principal  and
interest on their debt obligations.

OFFICE OF SCIENCE (Witness—Dr. Ray Orbach)

As part of the President’s American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), the FY 2008
budget  request  for  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  is  $4.4  billion.  This  represents  an  in-
crease of approximately $600 million, or 16 percent over the FY 2007 enacted level.
However,  this  falls  $189  million  short  of  the  funding  levels  authorized  in  Title  IX
of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  FY  2007  Joint
Funding Resolution (H.J. Res. 20) appropriated $3.8 billion for the Office of Science,
roughly $200 million more than the 2006 enacted amount, but far short of the $4.1
billion requested for 2007. The resolution requires that DOE report back to the Con-
gress  within  30  days  on  how  the  additional  $200  million  will  be  spent  within  the
Office  of  Science.  Otherwise  no  direction  is  given  as  to  increases  or  decreases  for
specific programs, making program comparisons between years difficult for the pur-
poses of this analysis.

The  FY  2008  request  for  Basic  Energy  Sciences  (BES)  is  $1.5  billion,  an  in-
crease  of  $388  million,  or  35  percent  above  the  FY06  enacted.  As  the  largest  pro-
gram  with  within  the  Office  of  Science,  BES  conducts  research  primarily  in  the
areas  of  materials  sciences  and  engineering.  In  FY  2008  BES  will  support  approxi-
mately 10,000 researchers in synchrotron light source and neutron scattering facili-
ties,  as  well  as  $279  million  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  five  Nanoscale
Science Research Centers.

The  budget  would  provide  $340  million  for  the  Advanced  Scientific  and  Com-
puting Research (ASCR), an increase of $112 million, or 49 percent over the FY06
appropriations.  This  includes  funding  to  continue  upgrading  the  Leadership  Class
Facility  (LCF)  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Lab  to  peta-scale  operations,  making  it  the
world’s largest civilian high performance computing system.

Biological and Environmental Research (BER) would receive $532 million, a
decrease  of  approximately  $32  million  from  FY06  enacted  levels.  This  decrease  re-
flects  the  omission  of  several  congressionally  directed  projects  in  the  BER  budget.
In  addition  to  the  role  of  BER  in  areas  such  as  genomics  and  climate  change  re-
search,  the  FY08  request  supports  the  startup  of  three  bioenergy  research  centers
to investigate biological processes for developing and deploying large scale, environ-
mentally  sound  biotechnologies  to  produce  ethanol  from  cellulosic  biomass  (plant
materials).

The  FY08  funding  request  for  High  Energy  Physics  (HEP)  is  $  782.2  million,
which  is  $84  million  or  12  percent  more  than  the  FY  2006  enacted  level,  but  only
a  one  percent  increase  over  the  FY  2007  request.  This  program  funds  fundamental

research in elementary particle physics and accelerator science and technology. Ap-
proximately  $80  million  is  requested  for  R&D  leading  to  the  International  Linear
Collider  (ILC),  a  project  which  could  cost  over  $7  billion  and  may  be  sited  in  the
U.S.

Fusion  Energy  Sciences  (FES)  receives  $428  million,  a  substantial  increase  of
$147 million, or 52 percent above the FY 2006 enacted. Of this amount, $160 million
would be dedicated to support the U.S. role in the International Thermonuclear Ex-
perimental Reactor (ITER).

Also of note, Nuclear Physics (NP) receives $471.3 million, an increase of $113.5
million,  or  31.7  percent,  over  the  FY06  enacted  amount.  The  request  for  Science
Laboratories Infrastructure is approximately $80 million.

APPLIED ENERGY TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS

While the total budget for energy R&D has risen in recent years it is still a frac-
tion of the robust levels seen when the Nation responded to the energy crisis of the
late 1970’s. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office the Department
of Energy’s budget authority for energy R&D fell 85 percent from 1978 to 2005 (in-
flation  adjusted).  Within  the  applied  programs  funding  varied  greatly  according  to
Administration and Congressional priorities as the chart below indicates.

Despite  heavy  investments  in  wind,  solar  and  geothermal  energy,  the  large  bulk
of  the  Nation’s  renewable  energy  portfolio  comes  from  hydropower  and  still  com-
prises  only  six  percent  of  total  electricity  generation.  The  Energy  Information  Ad-
ministration (EIA) projects that U.S. electricity generation will grow from 3,900 bil-
lion  kilowatt  hours  in  2005  to  5,500  billion  kilowatt  hours  in  2030.  Coal  will  make
up  most  of  this  growth  and  continue  to  provide  the  largest  part  of  U.S.  electricity
generation  for  the  foreseeable  future.  It  is  expected  that,  short  of  a  very  aggressive
resurgence  in  nuclear  capacity,  new  nuclear  plants  will  only  serve  to  replace  aging
existing plants in terms of overall electricity market share.

Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE)  (Witness—Alexander

Karsner)

EERE  is  requesting  $1.2  billion  for  FY08,  a  6.3  percent  increase  over  the  FY06
appropriated  level.  However,  the  request  is  significantly  less  than  the  amount  ap-
propriated  for  FY07  in  the  joint  funding  resolution  passed  on  February  15,  2007,
which  increased  appropriate  funds  more  than  $300  million  over  the  FY06  level  to
approximately $1.5 billion. As a result, the FY08 request actually represents a $237
million  cut  from  the  FY07  appropriated  amount.  As  with  the  Office  of  Science,  it
is not yet known how the Assistant Secretary for EERE will allocate the additional
$300 million. These allocations must be determined no later than 30 days after the
date of passage of the joint funding resolution. Since these allocations are yet to be
determined,  the  rest  of  this  analysis  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  the  FY08  request
and the FY06 appropriated amount.

Funding  for  priority  programs  continues  to  come  at  the  expense  of  other  lower-
profile  programs  where  significant  technological  gains  can  still  be  made.  The  FY08
request  contains  large  cuts  for  Weatherization  Programs,  the  Industrial  Tech-
nologies  Program,  and  the  Federal  Energy  Management  Program  (FEMP),
despite  a  Presidential  call  for  increasing  efficiency  in  all  three  of  these  areas.  The
Vehicle  Technologies  Program  also  suffers  a  slight  decrease.  The  FY  2008  request
also  proposes  to  eliminate  two  important  renewable  energy  R&D  programs—Geo-
thermal Technologies and Hydropower Technologies.

Biomass  and  Biorefinery  Systems  would  receive  $179  million,  almost  a  100
percent  increase  over  FY06  funding.  This  large  increase  is  intended  to  address  the
President’s goal of making cellulosic ethanol cost-competitive with corn-derived eth-
anol  by  2012,  and  also  enabling  a  supply  of  35  billion  gallons  of  alternative  fuels
annually in accordance with the Twenty in Ten initiative—a reduction of U.S. gaso-
line usage by 20 percent in the next ten years—as outlined in the 2007 State of the
Union  address.  While  the  general  goal  of  increasing  the  Nation’s  supply  of  alter-
native  fuels  is  widely  supported,  there  is  some  concern,  expressed  both  by  parties
within  DOE  and  in  the  renewable  fuels  community,  that  the  level  of  commercial
scale investment is too much too soon, given that the science of unlocking cellulosic
ethanol  is  still  uncertain.  Some  argue  that  some  of  that  funding  would  be  better
spent  in  the  short-term  investments  to  decrease  our  overall  energy  demand,  such
as technologies to increase vehicle fuel efficiency.

Solar  energy  would  receive  $148  million,  an  increase  of  81  percent  over  FY06
appropriations. This funding supports the President’s Solar America Initiative (SAI),
which  seeks  to  make  electricity  from  photovoltaic  cells  cost  competitive  by  2015.
Wind energy is slated for $40 million, essentially even with FY06 levels.

As in the 2007 budget request, the Administration would eliminate R&D in Geo-
thermal Power technologies. However, a comprehensive study released in January

by  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  found  that  the  large  amounts  of  heat
stored  in  the  Earth’s  crust  could  supply  a  substantial  portion  of  the  United  States’
future electricity requirements with minimal environmental impact and probably at
competitive prices. The primary obstacle to commercial development of this resource
was identified as lack of federal R&D support.

Hydropower R&D would also be eliminated, a category that includes funding for
ocean energy R&D (e.g., wave, tides, currents, etc.) despite explicit authorization in
EPACT 2005 for R&D in these technologies. According to the Office of EERE, in the
Pacific  Northwest  alone,  it  is  feasible  that  wave  energy  could  produce  40–70  kilo-
watts  (kW)  per  meter  (3.3  feet)  of  coastline,  yet  the  President’s  budget  requests  no
funds for R&D into this vast, clean, and renewable resource.

The Administration continues the inconsistent treatment of Energy Efficiency pro-
grams.  In  addition  to  the  Federal  Energy  Management  Program  and  the  Weather-
ization  program  several  cuts  are  made  throughout  the  budget.  Despite  mounting
concerns  about  the  role  vehicles  play  in  the  country’s  reliance  on  foreign  oil  the
FY08  request  for  Vehicle  Technologies  R&D  would  be  reduced  by  $2.2  million
over FY06, which includes funding for technologies for plug-in hybrid vehicles, light-
weight  vehicle  materials,  and  engine  technologies.  The  Industrial  Technologies
program, which aims to reduce the energy intensity of the U.S. economy by improv-
ing  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  Nation’s  industrial  sector,  would  decrease  by  $9.9
million,  a  decrease  of  almost  18  percent.  However,  Building  Technologies  would
rise  by  $18.3  million  compared  to  the  FY06  level,  a  27  percent  increase.  While  at-
tempting to pursue a balanced approach to developing clean energy technologies, the
EERE  budget  seems  to  exhibit  a  pattern  of  defunding  valuable  programs  to  fund
a few presidential priority projects, often with long-time horizons and uncertain pay-
offs.

Office of Nuclear Energy (Witness—Dennis Spurgeon)

Nuclear  Energy  (NE)  receives  $568  million  for  research  and  development,  with  a
large  portion  of  that  dedicated  to  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership  (GNEP).
For  the  Nuclear  office,  this  represents  an  increase  of  $347  million  (157  percent)
above the FY 2006 Congressionally appropriated amount.

The  Administration  unveiled  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership  (GNEP)  in
2006  as  a  plan  to  develop  advanced,  proliferation-resistant  nuclear  fuel  cycle  tech-
nologies that would maximize the energy extracted from nuclear fuels and minimize
nuclear  waste.  GNEP  has  been  very  controversial  in  Congress,  with  little  support
in the House where only token funding has been approved. For instance, the Admin-
istration  requested  approximately  $250  million  in  FY  2007  for  GNEP  (through  the
Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative—AFCI)  but  GNEP  will  likely  only  receive  roughly
$80  million  for  FY  2007  under  the  joint  funding  resolution.  Nonetheless,  the  Presi-
dent’s FY 2008 request for GNEP is $395 million.

Chief  among  the  concerns  about  GNEP  is  the  cost  of  implementing  the  program
(up to $40 billion) and then deploying a fleet of the required technologies on a com-
mercial  scale  (more  than  $200  billion),  and  whether  such  a  program  warrants  the
costs. There are also issues with premature selection of technologies before the com-
pletion  of  a  full  system-wide  analysis  of  what  would  be  required.  Many  are  con-
cerned  that  DOE  has  not  adequately  demonstrated  an  ability  to  carry  out  large
scale  construction  and  operation  of  such  a  project  without  major  cost  and  schedule
overruns.

Finally, the Nuclear Power 2010 program also would receive a considerable boost
with  an  FY08  request  of  $114  million,  which  is  almost  double  the  FY06  appropria-
tion.  The  increase  is  intended  to  continue  activities  in  new  reactor  designs  and  li-

Office  of  Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy  Reliability  (Witness—Kevin

Kolevar)

The  Office  of  Electricity  is  requesting  $115  million  for  FY08,  a  27  percent  reduc-
tion from the FY06 appropriation. Of the total for this office the Administration pro-
poses  $86  million  for  R&D,  a  $46.5  decrease  from  FY06  Appropriations.  This  con-
tinues  a  downward  trend  of  cutting  R&D  to  improve  the  reliability,  efficiency  and
security  of  the  Nations  electrical  grid  system,  improve  access  to  the  grid,  and  de-
crease price volatility in electricity delivery.

Many  of  the  EDER  programs  are  being  regrouped  and  consolidated  under  a  new
account  called  Visualization  and  Controls.  This  includes  Transmission  Reliability
R&D,  Energy  Storage  R&D,  GridWise,  and  GridWorks.  This  regrouping  hides  the
fact that most of these programs are being cut significantly.
Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program (LGP)

The FY 2008 budget proposes $8.4 million to fund the Office of Loan Guarantees,
which  will  administer  the  Innovative  Technology  Loan  Guarantee  Program  (LGP),
a $1.4 million increase above the FY 2007 enacted amount. The program was estab-
lished in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to provide loan guarantees for renewable en-
ergy,  energy  efficiency,  clean  coal,  advanced  nuclear,  and  other  innovative  energy
projects.  The  FY  2008  budget  request  assumes  a  loan  volume  of  $9  billion  for  such
projects.  Of  this,  $4  billion  is  set  aside  for  large  electric  power  generation  projects
such  as  advanced  nuclear  and  coal  gasification  with  carbon  sequestration.  An  addi-
tional $4 billion is set aside to promote biofuels and clean transportation fuels, and
$1 billion for new technologies in electricity transmission and renewable power sys-
tems.

Fossil Energy R&D (Witness—Thomas Shope)

Fossil  Energy  R&D  would  receive  $567  million  in  FY  2008,  a  decrease  of  almost
$14  million  or  2.5  percent  compared  to  FY  2007  appropriations.  Funding  increases
would  go  exclusively  to  coal  R&D,  including  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative
which  aims  to  develop  technologies  that  will  increase  efficiency  of  coal-fired  power
plants,  reduce  mercury  and  NOΧ emissions,  and  prove  carbon  capture  and  seques-
tration technologies. The FutureGen project, to demonstrate near-zero atmospheric
emissions electricity production, sees a substantial increase to $108 million, 500 per-
cent above the FY06 appropriated amounts. However, Fuels and Power Systems,
which  includes  R&D  on  advanced  coal  technologies  and  carbon  sequestration,  actu-
ally decreases to $184 million, 24 percent less than the FY06 appropriated amount.
While  the  carbon  sequestration  program  received  a  small  increase,  the  request
proposes conducting demos in only three or four sites across the country as opposed
to  doing  a  large  scale  demonstration  in  each  of  the  seven  regional  sequestration
partnerships. Many in the industry believe that, while federal investments have in-
creased  in  recent  years,  funding  for  this  program  and  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initia-
tive  may  be  woefully  inadequate  to  address  the  scale  of  challenges  facing  coal  as
it  continues  to  provide  approximately  half  of  the  Nation’s  electricity.  Potentially
forthcoming  greenhouse  gas  regulations  may  adversely  affect  the  coal  industry  and
some other sectors of the economy. Yet it is not clear that technologies are available
to cost effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the use of coal, and seques-
ter  carbon  dioxide  on  the  scales  required  for  a  national  greenhouse  gas  reduction
program.

The FY 2008 budget once again proposes to eliminate all oil and gas R&D, includ-
ing  $50  million  in  direct  spending  (mandated  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005)  for
unconventional  onshore  and  ultra-deepwater  offshore  natural  gas  exploration  tech-
nologies that would go largely to smaller independent oil and gas producers.

Chairman LAMPSON. This hearing will come to order. Good morn-

ing to everyone.

I  want  to  welcome  you  all  to  today’s  hearing,  entitled  ‘‘The  De-
partment  of  Energy  Fiscal  Year  2008  Research  and  Development
Budget Proposal.’’

We  changed  the  timing  of  this  meeting  this  morning  because  of
a  presentation  for  the  Joint  Houses  at  11:00,  and  we  wanted  to
make  sure  that  we  had  adequate  time  for  you  to  get  your  presen-
tations in, and hopefully, adequate number of questions.

I  will  proceed  with  my  opening  statement,  and  ask  unanimous
consent  that  when  the  Ranking  Member  comes  in,  that  we  inter-
rupt what proceedings are going on, if it is appropriate, to have his
opening remarks. Seeing no objection, that will stand.

I  would  like  to  extend  a  warm  welcome  to  all  five  witnesses.
Thank  you  for  being  here  today,  and  testifying  before  the  Sub-
committee  on  Energy  and  Environment.  The  focus  of  our  inquiry
today  is  the  President’s  2008  budget  request  for  research  and  de-
velopment programs in the Department of Energy.

Now, I know I don’t have to remind anyone in this room just how
high  energy  prices  and  costs  for  action  to  mitigate  climate  change
have  propelled  energy  to  the  forefront  of  public  debate  in  the  last
few  years.  Our  nation’s  energy  challenges  are  momentous  and  in-
credibly diverse, and I am pleased to see that the President’s budg-
et  request  for  fiscal  year  2008  takes  a  number  of  important  steps,
and  even  some  grand  leaps  in  pursuit  of  technological  solutions  to
these challenges.

However,  one  can’t  help  but  notice  serious  gaps  in  R&D  funding
for  certain  programs.  While  resources  are  lavished  on  some  high
profile research areas, other valuable programs are left to languish.
In a time of intense challenge, it is important that we keep all pos-
sibilities  on  the  table.  For  instance,  in  the  President’s  budget,  hy-
drogen, solar, and cellulosic ethanol are beneficiaries of major fund-
ing  increases.  This  is  encouraging,  but  this  encouraging  trend  is
offset  by  large  cuts  and  flat  funding  of  equally  valuable  programs
in  areas  such  as  geothermal,  hydropower,  ocean  wave  power,  ad-
vanced grid technologies, and even oil and gas research.

Furthermore,  the  Administration  continues  its  trend  of  slashing
funds for valuable energy efficiency programs, that help states, low
income consumers, industries, vehicle manufacturers, and even the
Federal  Government  use  energy  more  efficiently.  Efficiency  must
be  regarded  as  another  valuable  source  of  energy.  After  all,  the
cheapest,  cleanest,  most  secure,  and  most  domestic  energy  is  the
energy  you  never  have  to  produce  at  all.  Enormous  opportunities
exist to increase the efficiency, intelligence, and security of the Na-
tion’s  electricity  grid  without  simply  erecting  more  towers  and
stringing  more  wire.  However,  the  Nation  has  not  deployed  these
technologies  widely  yet,  and  research  and  development  funding  in
many  of  these  related  programs  has  been  cut  in  this  budget  re-
quest.

The  Administration  requests  a  very  aggressive  increase  in  fund-
ing  for  nuclear  energy,  primarily  to  fund  the  Global  Nuclear  En-
ergy Partnership, GNEP. Carbon-free nuclear energy may very well
play a vital role in addressing our climate crisis, and it is clear that
issues  of  waste  disposal  have  to  be  resolved,  but  the  Department

11

must convince this Congress and the public that the billions it will
cost  to  implement  the  program  and  deploy  a  fleet  of  these  tech-
nologies is warranted, and conduct full systems analysis for GNEP.
I am particularly disappointed to see that for the second year in
a row, the Administration insists on ignoring EPAct 2005 by failing
to  carry  out  vital  research  and  development  into  ultra-deepwater
and  unconventional  drilling  technologies.  This  illustrates  a  funda-
mental  misunderstanding  both  of  what  the  program  is  intended  to
do and the need to expand domestic resources of fossil fuels.

I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  special  role  of  the  Office  of
Science within DOE. Although sometimes overlooked in the greater
energy debate, the Office of Science, as the leading federal sponsor
of research in the physical sciences, plays a critical part in our na-
tion’s scientific and technological competitiveness.

The Office of Science has a longstanding role as steward of large,
world-class  scientific  research  facilities.  However,  construction  and
operation of facilities has come at the expense of funding for actual
research  at  these  facilities.  I  am  glad  to  see  Dr.  Orbach  plans  to
put this back on track.

Furthermore,  as  the  Department  pursues  plans  for  additional
large-scale  scientific  facilities,  demonstrable  measures  should  be
taken to assure due diligence in the areas of cost estimates and de-
sign.  This  gives  everyone  a  higher  level  of  comfort  when  multi-bil-
lion  dollar  research  machines,  such  as  the  ILC,  are  proposed  to
Congress.

The  fiscal  year  2008  request  makes  a  commitment  to  the  Office
of  Science  that  is  essential  to  maintaining  our  economic  competi-
tiveness,  drawing  a  new  generation  into  the  physical  sciences,  and
successfully  meeting  future  challenges,  whether  they  be  energy-re-
lated or otherwise.

In  the  end,  it  is  encouraging  that  the  President’s  Fiscal  Year
2008 budget request for DOE R&D programs takes a solid step for-
ward.  However,  it  is  important  that  that  step  forward  benefit  all
worthwhile programs, not just a few high-profile, exciting ones.

Today’s  witnesses  find  themselves  at  the  crossroads  of  intense
political  pressures,  and  the  technological  cutting  edge,  and  prob-
ably spend much of their time trying to reconcile the two, never an
easy  task.  Again,  we  thank  them  all,  and  look  forward  to  hearing
their testimony today.

And  at  this  time,  I  will  call  on  Ranking  Member  Mr.  Inglis  for

his opening statement.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

I would like to extend a warm welcome to all five witnesses. Thank you for being

able  programs  are  left  to  languish.  In  a  time  of  intense  challenge,  it  is  important
that we keep all possibilities on the table.

For  instance,  in  the  President’s  budget,  Hydrogen,  Solar  and  Cellulosic  ethanol
are beneficiaries of major funding increases. But this encouraging trend is offset by
large  cuts  and  flat-funding  of  equally  valuable  programs  in  areas  such  as  geo-
thermal,  hydropower,  ocean  wave  power,  advanced  grid  technologies,  and  even  oil
& gas research.

Furthermore,  the  Administration  continues  its  trend  of  slashing  funds  for  valu-

ministration  insists  on  ignoring  EPAct  2005  by  failing  to  carry  out  vital  research
and  development  into  Ultra-Deepwater  and  Unconventional  drilling  technologies.
This  illustrates  a  fundamental  misunderstanding  both  of  what  the  program  is  in-
tended to do and the need to expand domestic resources of fossil fuels.

when multi-billion dollar research machines, such as the I.L.C. are proposed to Con-
gress.

The  FY08  request  makes  a  commitment  to  the  Office  of  Science  that  is  essential
to  maintaining  our  economic  competitiveness,  drawing  a  new  generation  into  the
physical  sciences,  and  successfully  meeting  future  challenges,  whether  they  be  en-

ciling the two—never an easy job. Again, we thank them and look forward to hear-
ing their testimony today.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I got released from the American Legion, and now I am here, and
thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing,  and  thank  the  witnesses  for
being here.

There is a difference, seems to me, between simple spending and
thoughtful  investing,  and  that  is  what  I  hope  we  are  here  to  dis-
cuss  today.  Simple  spending  just  doesn’t—it  is  maybe  good,  it  cre-
ates  an  immediate  impact,  but  investing  creates  returns  in  the  fu-
ture.  And  so  I  am  very  grateful  for  the  work  of  the  Department  of
Energy in—on these kind of investments. It really could change the
game for us.

So,  as  we  discuss  the  R&D  budget  today,  we  are  really  acting
more  as  investors  here,  investors  who  are  looking  at  alternative
fuel industries, for example, and seeing the payoffs that they could
produce  for  us,  and  we  realize  that  we  have  a  great  need  to  break
free  of  an  addiction  to  oil,  and  some  of  the  work  that  you  all  are
doing could help make that happen.

So,  we  are  certainly  not  there  yet.  Obviously,  more  commitment
is needed, and we are going to need to spend good money to accom-
plish  the  objectives  that  we  have  set  out.  I  think  that  many  of  us
want  to  see  the  market  make  some  of  these  decisions  about  what
fuels  work  and  that  sort  of  thing,  and  I  trust  markets  mostly.  It
is also true that some basic research needs to be done, and the peo-
ple that are going to do that are in the Department of Energy and
places like that, so we thank you for your work.

I  am  particularly  excited  that  the  Chairman  mentioned  we  don’t
want  to  focus  on  just  the  high  profile  ones,  but  one  favorite  one  is
the President’s Hydrogen Initiative, because what a triple play op-
portunity,  to  do  three  things  all  at  once  that  every  American,  I
think,  wants  to  do.  One  is  improve  the  national  security  of  the
United  States  by  no  longer  being  dependent  on  the  Middle  East.
Second,  clean  up  the  air,  because  the  emissions  would  be  water.
And third, create jobs as we do that.

And  of  course,  South  Carolina  probably  isn’t  thought  of  as  a  car
producing  state,  but  that  is  what  we  are  now,  and  we  have  got  a
wonderful  company,  BMW,  that  stands  for  Bubba  Makes  Wheels,
and so, Bubba is making a lot of wheels in South Carolina, and we
hope that the BMW H7 starts sweeping the country, and if it does,
who  knows,  maybe  we  will  make  some  of  those  in  South  Carolina.
But  it  is  an  example  of  what  exciting  things  can  happen  when
people  put  money  into  research,  and  so,  we  are  looking  forward  to
hearing your suggestions about how to do that.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  want  to  thank  our  witnesses  from  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  for  appearing  here  today  to  discuss  funding  for  vital  research  and
development projects.

As  we  discuss  the  proposed  R&D  budget  today,  I  think  we  all  realize  that  we
aren’t  accountants  sitting  around  just  talking  numbers—we’re  investors.  The  alter-
native  fuel  industry  is  a  start-up  business  opportunity  that  promises  huge  payoffs
for  our  nation’s  security,  environment,  and  our  economy.  We  have  the  ability  and
opportunity  to  partner  with  this  promising  enterprise  and  lend  federal  resources  to
help establish the alternative energy industry.

We haven’t yet reached a place of energy security, nor have we scratched the sur-
face  of  what  economic  benefits  will  come  from  energy  advancements,  but  we  don’t
have  to  look  far  to  see  great  payoffs  from  today’s  investments.  For  that  reason,  we
must stay committed to providing our scientists, national labs, and other R&D pro-
grams  with  adequate  funding  to  continue  the  progress  already  made,  and  ensure
our nation’s energy security.

We should focus funding on a vast array of alternatives—hydrogen, biofuels, wind,
solar,  and  nuclear.  If  we  are  true  investors,  we  will  use  discretion  as  certain  alter-
natives  prove  to  be  more  valuable  than  others.  For  now,  there  are  many  roads  for
our  engineers,  inventors,  and  scientists  to  follow,  and  we  should  not  close  those
roads.  On  that  note,  I  have  specific  concerns  I  will  address  regarding  the  future  of
the  President’s  Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative.  For  example,  what  exactly  does  the  pro-
posal mean when it says that the budget request ‘‘completes the President’s commit-
ment  of  $1.2  billion  over  five  years  for  this  initiative?’’  I  hope  that  you  agree  with
me that $1.2 billion is a good start and certainly not the end of our efforts.

Thank you for the Department of Energy’s past, present, and future commitments

to research and develop tomorrow’s energy solutions.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  thank  the  Ranking  Member.  If  there  are
other Members who wish to submit additional opening statements,
your statements will be added to the record.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  morning.  I  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  appearing  before  our  sub-
committee  to  examine  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  fiscal  year  2008  (FY08)
Budget request for Research and Development Programs.

I  am  privileged  to  represent  the  12th  Congressional  District  of  Illinois,  a  region
rich in coal reserves and a proud mining tradition. Coal plays a vital role as an en-
ergy  source,  and  the  industries  involved  in  the  mining,  transportation  and  utiliza-
tion of coal provide thousands of jobs for Illinoisans and economic stability to many
communities across the State. Further, the Clean Coal Research Center at Southern
Illinois  University  (SIUC),  the  State  of  Illinois  and  its  energy  industries  are  com-
mitted  to  the  development  and  application  of  technologies  for  the  environmentally
sound use of Illinois coal. In addition, they have several programs, such as the Illi-
nois  Coal  Competitiveness  Program,  the  Illinois  Coal  Education  Program,  and  the
Illinois Coal Research Center, to further this mission.

As a senior Member of the House Science and Technology Committee and the En-
ergy and Environment Subcommittee, I have been a strong advocate for federal coal
initiatives  and  programs.  I  am  focused  on  increasing  the  funding  levels  for  Clean
Coal Research and Development (R&D) Programs for FY08 because coal is going to
be the mainstay for electricity generation well into the future. While federal invest-
ments  have  increased  slightly  in  recent  years  for  Coal  Research  and  Development
(R&D),  I  am  concerned  that  overall  funding  for  several  coal  programs  are  woefully
inadequate  to  address  the  scale  of  challenges  facing  coal  as  it  continues  to  provide
approximately half of the Nation’s electricity.

I  believe  clean  coal  technology  is  part  of  the  solution  to  achieving  U.S.  energy
independence, continued economic prosperity and improved environmental steward-
ship.  FutureGen,  a  275-megawatt  coal  fueled  power  plant,  is  an  example  of  an  im-
portant  DOE  clean  coal  R&D  and  demonstration  project  designed  to  turn  coal  into
both  electricity  and  hydrogen  fuel  with  minimal  air  pollution.  To  address  climate
change, FutureGen would also bury its heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions deep
underground.  No  project  of  this  magnitude  is  in  operation  anywhere  in  the  world
at a commercial scale. That is why I am concerned the President’s proposed budget
seeks  to  rescind  $149  million  from  the  Clean  Coal  Technology  account,  acting
against  prior  congressional  intent  to  defer  and  designate  the  un-obligated  Clean
Coal Technology funds for FutureGen.

Another  important  coal  program  in  the  President’s  Coal  Research  Initiative  that
complements FutureGen and seeks to drive down the cost of clean coal technologies
is  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  (CCPI).  CCPI  is  a  cooperative,  cost  shared  pro-
gram  between  the  government  and  industry  to  rapidly  demonstrate  emerging  tech-
nologies  in  coal-based  power  generation  to  help  accelerate  their  commercialization.
While CCPI received a slight increase in the President’s proposed FY08 budget, the
funding level is not sufficient. If Congress passes legislation to regulate carbon diox-
ide,  advanced  clean  coal  technologies  must  be  successfully  demonstrated  and  com-
mercialized.  This  is  the  goal  of  the  CCPI  program  and  Congress  and  the  Adminis-
tration  must  work  together  to  increase  its  funding  to  achieve  its  stated  purpose.
Further, I believe several large scale demonstrations of efficiency improvements and
carbon  capture  technologies  that  can  be  applied  to  the  existing  fleet  are  critical  to
continued  coal  use  if  we  are  going  to  achieve  meaningful  reductions  of  carbon  diox-
ide emissions in this country.

Finally, the Administration’s carbon sequestration program within the DOE is de-
veloping  a  portfolio  of  technologies  that  hold  great  potential  to  reduce  greenhouse
gas  emissions.  The  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Partnership,  of  which  we  have
one for the Illinois Basin, are providing the critical data that the U.S. needs to sup-
port carbon dioxide sequestration as a strategy for addressing global climate change.
The  DOE  had  put  out  a  request  for  proposals  for  Phase  III  large  scale  field  testing
of  geological  sequestration  in  December  but  then  canceled  it  when  the  President’s
FY08  budget  came  in  with  lesser  funds  than  needed  to  support  these  tests.  This  is
not  the  time  to  limit  the  amount  of  activities  DOE  should  be  undertaking  in  the
coal program. The budget for carbon reducing technologies must be realistic if Con-
gress  is  going  to  take  a  hard-fast  look  at  regulating  greenhouse  gases  in  this  coun-

try. Therefore, it is essential that a robust budget to develop clean coal technologies
and reduce carbon dioxide must be provided for FY08.

I look forward to hearing from our panel of witnesses.

STATEMENT OF DR. RAYMOND L. ORBACH, UNDER

SECRETARY FOR SCIENCE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Mr.  ORBACH.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson.  Mr.  Chairman,
Congressman  Inglis,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  grateful  for
the opportunity this morning to discuss the President’s Fiscal Year
2008 budget request for the Office of Science. I want to thank you,
Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Inglis,  for  your  kind  remarks  about  basic  re-
search and the Office of Science.

The  DOE  Office  of  Science  is  the  primary  agency  in  the  Federal
Government for energy-related basic research. The Office interfaces
with  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Applied  Research  programs,  rep-
resented  by  my  colleagues  here  this  morning,  upon  which  our  na-
tion  relies  for  both  energy  security  and  national  defense.  Our  goal
is  to  underpin  the  applied  research  programs  with  the  finest  basic
science,  and  at  the  same  time,  to  energize  our  basic  research  with
insights and opportunities from advanced applied research.

Transformational  basic  science  discoveries  are  essential  to  the
success  of  the  Department’s  efforts  in  hydrogen,  solar  power,  and
biofuels.  We  are  one  department,  and  we  have  been  working  very
hard  together  on  strengthening  the  relationship  between  the  De-
partment’s basic and applied research programs.

Let me say a few words this morning about the critical role that
basic  science  plays  in  addressing  our  nation’s  energy  challenge.
Two  examples.  The  first  is  cellulosic  ethanol.  To  make  this  biofuel
cost-effective, we must produce ethanol from cellulose directly. The
problem is that the lignins that surround the cellulose in plants in-
hibit currently available enzymes from breaking down the cellulose
into sugars that can be fermented into ethanol.

The Office of Science will be deploying three innovative new bio-
energy research centers, studying both microbes and plants, devel-
oping new methods on processes actually found in nature to create
the  breakthroughs  that  we  need.  For  example,  our  DOE  Joint  Ge-
nome  Institute  announced  this  week,  in  conjunction  with  the  U.S.
Forest  Service,  that  identification  of  the  metabolic  pathways  in  a
fungus found in the bowels of insects that holds the secret to effec-
tive  fermentation  of  the  sugar  xylose,  a  key  to  making  cellulosic
ethanol cost-effective.

Second,  consider  intermittent  sources  of  energy,  such  as  wind
and  solar  and  tidal.  The  key  to  base  load  electrical  contributions
from these renewable sources is electric energy storage. In April of
this year, we will bring together leading scientists and people from
industry for a major workshop to chart a transformational path for-
ward  for  electrical  energy  storage.  We  shall  be  considering  super-
capacitors and other innovative approaches based on the latest ad-
vances  in  materials  and  nanotechnology,  to  change  the  way  we
think  about  electrical  storage.  Solving  this  problem  is  an  enabling
key  for  renewable  energy  to  make  major  contributions  to  electric
base load generation.

These  are  examples  of  our  mission  in  the  Office  of  Science,  in-
vestment  in  basic  research  to  generate  transformational  scientific
breakthroughs  for  our  nation.  Supporting  transformational  re-
search  also  means  providing  cutting  edge  scientific  facilities
through  our  ten  National  Laboratories  that  will  allow  scientists
from universities and the private sector to do the analysis that will
give  them  advantages  over  their  colleagues  in  other  countries,
thereby  contributing  to  American  competitiveness.  It  means  edu-
cating,  training,  and  sustaining  a  world-class  scientific  workforce,
thousands  strong,  25,500  supported  by  the  Office  of  Science  in  our
fiscal  year  2008  budget  in  laboratories  and  universities  across  our
nation for the sake of our country’s future.

We are not doing this in a vacuum. Other nations are increasing
their  investment  in  basic  science,  because  they  know  that  those
who  dominate  science  will  dominate  the  Twenty  First  Century
global economy. To remain competitive, we cannot afford to fall be-
hind other nations in R&D. To remain competitive, the President’s
Fiscal Year 2008 budget request for the Office of Science is $4.4 bil-
lion, an increase of seven percent over the fiscal year 2007 request.
It  is  an  important  milestone  on  the  path  to  doubling  federal  sup-
port  for  basic  research  in  the  physical  sciences  over  the  next  ten
years,  and  an  indispensable  investment  in  our  nation’s  energy  se-
curity  and  America’s  continued  competitiveness  in  the  global  econ-
omy.

Thank you, and I will be pleased to answer questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RAYMOND L. ORBACH

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
testify  today  on  the  Office  of  Science’s  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2008  budget  request.  I  ap-
preciate  your  support  for  the  Office  of  Science  and  basic  research  in  the  physical
sciences, Mr. Chairman, and your understanding of the importance of this research
to  our  nation’s  energy  security  and  economic  competitiveness.  I  also  want  to  thank
the  Members  of  the  Committee  for  their  support.  I  believe  this  budget  will  enable
the  Office  of  Science  to  deliver  on  its  mission  and  enhance  U.S.  competitiveness
through  our  support  of  transformational  science,  national  scientific  facilities,  and
the scientific workforce for the Nation’s future.

The  Office  of  Science  requests  $4,397,876,000  for  the  FY  2008  Science  appropria-
tion, an increase of $600,582,000 over the FY 2007 appropriated level. The FY 2008
budget request for the Office of Science represents the second year of the President’s
commitment  to  double  the  federal  investment  in  basic  research  in  the  physical
sciences by the year 2016 as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. It also
represents a continued commitment to maintain U.S. leadership in science and rec-
ognition  of  the  valuable  role  research  in  the  physical  sciences  plays  in  technology
innovation and global competitiveness.

With  the  FY  2008  budget  request  the  Office  of  Science  will  continue  to  support
transformational  science—basic  research  for  advanced  scientific  breakthroughs  that

will  revolutionize  our  approach  to  the  Nation’s  energy,  environment,  and  national
security  challenges.  The  Office  of  Science  is  the  Nation’s  steward  for  fields  such  as
high  energy  physics,  nuclear  physics,  heavy  element  chemistry,  plasma  physics,
magnetic fusion, and catalysis. It also supports unique components of U.S. research
in climate change and geophysics.

Researchers funded through the Office of Science are working on some of the most
pressing scientific challenges of our age including: 1) Harnessing the power of micro-
bial  communities  and  plants  for  energy  production  from  renewable  sources,  carbon
sequestration,  and  environmental  remediation;  2)  Expanding  the  frontiers  of
nanotechnology  to  develop  materials  with  unprecedented  properties  for  widespread
potential  scientific,  energy,  and  industrial  applications;  3)  Pursuing  the  break-
throughs in materials science, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and other fields need-
ed  to  make  solar  energy  more  cost-effective;  4)  Demonstrating  the  scientific  and
technological  feasibility  of  creating  and  controlling  a  sustained  burning  plasma  to
generate energy, as the next step toward making fusion power a commercial reality;
5)  Using  advanced  computation,  simulation,  and  modeling  to  understand  and  pre-
dict the behavior of complex systems beyond the reach of some of our most powerful
experimental probes, with potentially transformational impacts on a broad range of
scientific  and  technological  undertakings;  6)  Understanding  the  origin  of  the  uni-
verse  and  nature  of  dark  matter  and  dark  energy;  and  7)  Resolving  key  uncertain-
ties  and  expanding  the  scientific  foundation  needed  to  understand,  predict,  and  as-
sess the potential effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide on climate and the environ-
ment.

U.S.  leadership  in  many  areas  of  science  and  technology  depends  in  part  on  the
continued  availability  of  the  most  advanced  scientific  facilities  for  our  researchers.
The  Office  of  Science  builds  and  operates  national  scientific  facilities  and  instru-
ments  that  make  up  the  world’s  most  sophisticated  suite  of  research  capabilities.
The  resources  available  for  scientific  research  include  advanced  synchrotron  light
sources,  the  new  Spallation  Neutron  Source,  state-of-the-art  Nanoscale  Science  Re-
search  Centers,  supercomputers  and  high-speed  networks,  climate  and  environ-
mental  monitoring  capabilities,  particle  accelerators  and  detectors  for  high  energy
and  nuclear  physics,  and  genome  sequencing  facilities  We  are  in  the  process  of  de-
veloping  new  tools  such  as  an  X-ray  free  electron  laser  light  source  that  can  image
single large macromolecules and measure in real-time changes in the chemical bond
as chemical and biological reactions take place, a next generation synchrotron light
source for x-ray imaging and capable of nanometer resolution, and detectors and in-
struments for world-leading neutrino physics research. SC will also select and begin
funding  in  FY  2007  for  three  Bioenergy  Research  Centers  to  conduct  fundamental
research on microbes and plants needed to produce biologically-based fuel

Office  of  Science  leadership  in  support  of  the  physical  sciences  and  stewardship
of  large  national  research  facilities  is  directly  linked  to  our  historic  role  in  training
America’s  scientists  and  engineers.  In  addition  to  funding  a  diverse  portfolio  of  re-
search at more than 300 colleges and universities nationwide, we provide direct sup-
port  and  access  to  research  facilities  for  thousands  of  university  students  and  re-
searchers. Facilities at the national laboratories provide unique opportunities for re-
searchers  and  their  students  from  across  the  country  to  pursue  questions  at  the
intersection  of  physics,  chemistry,  biology,  computing,  and  materials  science.  About
half  of  the  annual  21,000  users  of  the  Office  of  Science’s  scientific  facilities  come
from  universities.  The  FY  2008  budget  will  support  the  research  of  approximately
25,500  faculty,  postdoctoral  researchers,  and  graduate  students  throughout  the  Na-
tion,  an  increase  of  3,600  from  FY  2006,  in  addition  to  supporting  undergraduate
research internships and fellowships and research and training opportunities for K–
14 science educators at the national laboratories.

The approximate $600 million increase in FY 2008 from the FY 2007 appropriated
level  will  bring  manageable  increases  to  the  Office  of  Science  programs  for  long
planned  for  activities.  The  FY  2008  request  will  allow  the  Office  of  Science  to  in-
crease support for high-priority DOE mission-driven scientific research and new ini-
tiatives;  maintain  optimum  operations  at  our  scientific  user  facilities;  continuing
major facility construction projects; and enhance educational, research, and training
opportunities  for  the  Nation’s  future  scientific  workforce.  The  budget  request  will
also  support  basic  research  that  contributes  to  Presidential  initiatives  such  as  the
Hydrogen  Fuel  Initiative  and  the  Advanced  Energy  Initiative,  the  Climate  Change
Science and Technology Programs, and the National Nanotechnology Initiative.

The  following  programs  are  supported  in  the  FY  2008  budget  request:  Basic  En-
ergy  Sciences,  Advanced  Scientific  Computing  Research,  Biological  and  Environ-
mental  Research,  Fusion  Energy  Sciences,  High  Energy  Physics,  Nuclear  Physics,
Workforce  Development  for  Teachers  and  Scientists,  Science  Laboratories  Infra-
structure, Science Program Direction, and Safeguards and Security.

FY 2008 SCIENCE PRIORITIES

The challenges we face today in energy and the environment are some of the most
vexing and complex in our history. Our success in meeting these challenges will de-
pend in large part on how well we maintain this country’s leadership in science and
technology because it is through scientific and technological innovation and a skilled
workforce that these challenges will be solved.

President  George  W.  Bush  made  this  point  in  his  State  of  the  Union  Message  on

January 23, 2007, when he stated,

‘‘It’s  in  our  vital  interest  to  diversify  America’s  energy  supply—the  way  forward
is  through  technology. . ..  We  must  continue  changing  the  way  America  gen-
erates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind
energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research
for  plug-in  and  hybrid  vehicles,  and  expand  the  use  of  clean  diesel  vehicles  and
biodiesel  fuel.  We  must  continue  investing  in  new  methods  of  producing  eth-
anol—using  everything  from  wood  chips  to  grasses,  to  agricultural  wastes. . ..
‘‘America  is  on  the  verge  of  technological  breakthroughs  that  will  enable  us  to
live our lives less dependent on oil. And these technologies will help us to be bet-
ter stewards of the environment, and they will help us confront the serious chal-
lenge of global climate change.’’

In  2006,  the  President  announced  a  commitment  to  double  the  budget  for  basic
research  in  the  physical  sciences  at  key  agencies  over  ten  years  to  maintain  U.S.
leadership  in  science  and  ensure  continued  global  competitiveness.  This  commit-
ment received bipartisan support in both the House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate  and  the  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  Office  of  Science  represents  the  second
year  of  this  effort.  Through  the  FY  2008  budget,  the  Office  of  Science  will  build  on
its record of results with sound investments to keep U.S. research and development

at  the  forefront  of  global  science  and  prepare  the  scientific  workforce  we  will  need
in the 21st century to address our nation’s challenges.

Determining  and  balancing  science  and  technology  priorities  across  the  Office  of
Science  programs  is  an  ongoing  process.  Several  factors  are  considered  in  our
prioritization,  including  scientific  opportunities  identified  by  the  broader  scientific
community through Office of Science sponsored workshops; external review and rec-
ommendations  by  scientific  advisory  committees;  DOE  mission  needs;  and  national
and  departmental  priorities.  In  FY  2008,  we  will  support  the  priorities  in  scientific
research,  facility  operations,  and  construction  and  laboratory  infrastructure  estab-
lished in the past few years and outlined in the Office of Science Strategic Plan and
Twenty-year  Facilities  Outlook,  in  addition  to  national  and  departmental  priorities
and new research opportunities identified in recent workshops.

National  initiatives  in  hydrogen  fuel  cell  and  advanced  energy  technologies  will
be  supported  through  our  contributions  to  basic  research  in  hydrogen,  fusion,  solar
energy-to-fuels, and production of ethanol and other biofuels from cellulose. We will
also  continue  strong  support 
for  other  Administration  priorities  such  as
nanotechnology,  advanced  scientific  computation,  and  climate  change  science  and
technology.

The  Office  of  Science  will  support  three  Bioenergy  Research  Centers  in  FY  2008
as part of the broader Genomics: GTL program. These centers, to be selected in FY
2007  and  fully  operational  by  the  end  of  2008,  will  conduct  comprehensive,  multi-
disciplinary  research  programs  focused  on  microbes  and  plants  to  drive  scientific
breakthroughs necessary for the development of cost-effective biofuels and bioenergy
production. The broader GTL program will also continue to support fundamental re-
search  and  technology  development  needed  to  understand  the  complex  behavior  of
biological  systems  for  the  development  of  innovative  biotechnology  solutions  to  en-
ergy production, environmental mitigation, and carbon management.

The  Office  of  Science  designs,  constructs,  and  operates  facilities  and  instruments
that  provide  world-leading  research  tools  and  capabilities  for  U.S.  researchers  and
will continue to support next generation tools for enabling transformational science.
For  example,  the  Spallation  Neutron  Source  (SNS),  the  world’s  forefront  neutron
scattering  facility,  increases  the  number  of  neutrons  available  for  cutting-edge  re-
search  by  a  factor  of  ten  over  any  existing  spallation  neutron  source  in  the  world.
SNS  was  completed  and  began  operations  in  2006  and  in  FY  2008  full  operations
are supported and additional experimental capabilities continue to be added.

When  it  comes  on  line,  the  Linac  Coherent  Light  Source  (LCLS)  at  the  Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) will produce X-rays 10 billion times more intense
than  any  existing  X-ray  source  in  the  world,  and  will  allow  structural  studies  on
individual  nanoscale  particles  and  single  biomolecules.  Construction  of  LCLS  con-
tinues in FY 2008.

A  next  generation  synchrotron  light  source,  the  National  Synchrotron  Light
Source-II (NSLS–II), would deliver orders of magnitude improvement in spatial res-
olution, providing the world’s finest capabilities for X-ray imaging and enabling the
study  of  material  properties  and  functions,  particularly  at  the  nanoscale,  at  a  level
of detail and precision never before possible. Its energy resolution would explore dy-
namic properties of matter as no other light source has ever accomplished. Support
for  continued  R&D  and  project  engineering  and  design  (PED)  are  provided  in  FY
2008.

All  five  of  DOE’s  Nanoscale  Science  Research  Centers  (NSRCs)  will  be  operating
in FY 2008. These facilities are the Nation’s premier nanoscience user centers, pro-
viding  resources  unmatched  to  the  scientific  community  for  the  synthesis,  fabrica-
tion, and analysis of nanoparticles and nanomaterials.

We will fully fund the programs for advanced scientific computing, including: con-
tinued  support  for  high-performance  production  computing  at  the  National  Energy
Research  Scientific  Computing  Center  (NERSC),  which  will  increase  capacity  to
100–150  teraflops  in  FY  2007;  support  for  advanced  capabilities  for  modeling  and
simulation  of  scientific  problems  in  combustion,  fusion,  and  complex  chemical  reac-
tions  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory’s  Leadership  Computing  Facility,  which
should  deliver  250  teraflops  computing  capability  by  the  end  of  FY  2008;  and  sup-
port for the upgrade to 250–500 teraflop peak capacity of the IBM Blue Gene P sys-
tem  at  Argonne  National  Laboratory’s  Leadership  Computing  Facility  to  extend  ar-
chitectural diversity in leadership computing.

The Office of Science continues to be a partner in the interagency Climate Change
Science Program focusing on understanding the principal uncertainties of the causes
and  effects  of  climate  change,  including  abrupt  climate  change,  understanding  the
global carbon cycle, developing predictive models for climate change over decades to
centuries,  and  supporting  basic  research  for  biological  sequestration  of  carbon.  We
also  continue  to  support  research  in  geosciences  and  environmental  remediation  to-

wards the development of scientific and technological solutions to long-term environ-
mental challenges.

The Office of Science will continue to actively lead and support the U.S. contribu-
tions to ITER, the international project to build and operate the first fusion science
facility  capable  of  producing  a  sustained  burning  plasma  to  generate  energy  on  a
massive scale without environmental insult.

The  historic  international  fusion  energy  agreement  to  build  ITER  with  six  other

international partners was signed in November 2006.

We  continue  strong  support  for  experimental  and  theoretical  high  energy  physics
and the study of the elementary constituents of matter and energy and interactions
at  the  heart  of  physics.  Full  operations  at  the  Tevatron  Collider  at  Fermilab  and
the  B-factory  at  SLAC  are  supported  to  maximize  the  scientific  research  and  data
derived  from  these  facilities.  Full  operation  of  the  neutrino  oscillation  experiment
at  Fermilab  and  start  of  fabrication  of  a  next  generation  detector  are  supported  to
provide  a  platform  for  a  world-leading  neutrino  program  in  the  U.S.  International
Linear  Collider  (ILC)  R&D  and  superconducting  radio  frequency  technology  R&D
are  supported  to  enable  the  most  compelling  scientific  opportunities  in  high  energy
physics in the coming decades.

Our research programs in nuclear physics continue to receive strong support. Op-
erations  at  the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider  (RHIC)  and  additional  instrumenta-
tion  projects  for  RHIC  are  supported  for  studies  of  the  properties  of  hot,  dense  nu-
clear  matter,  providing  insight  into  the  early  universe.  We  will  also  support  oper-
ations  at  the  Continuous  Electron  Beam  Accelerator  Facility  (CEBAF),  the  world’s
most  powerful  ‘‘microscope’’  for  studying  the  quark  structure  of  matter,  and  project
engineering  and  design  and  R&D  for  doubling  the  energy  of  the  existing  beam  at
CEBAF  to  12  gigaelectron  volts  (GeV).  Support  for  R&D  to  develop  advanced  rare
isotope  beam  capabilities  for  the  next  generation  U.S.  facility  for  nuclear  structure
and astrophysics is also provided.

The  standard  of  living  we  enjoy  and  the  security  of  our  nation  now  and  in  the
future rests on the quality of science and technology education we provide America’s
students from elementary through graduate school and beyond. The FY 2008 budget
will provide support for over 25,500 Ph.D.s, graduate students, engineers, and tech-
nical professionals, an increase of 3,600 over the number supported in FY 2006. The
Office  of  Science  will  also  support  the  development  of  leaders  in  the  science  and
mathematics  education  community  through  participation  of  K–14  teachers  in  the
DOE  Academies  Creating  Teacher  Scientists  program,  formerly  the  Laboratory
Science Teacher Professional Development program. This immersion program at the
national  laboratories  is  an  opportunity  for  teachers  to  work  with  laboratory  sci-
entists as mentors and to build content knowledge, research skills, and lasting con-
nections  to  the  scientific  community,  ultimately  leading  to  more  effective  teaching
that  inspires  students  in  science  and  math.  The  year  2008  will  also  mark  the  18th
year  of  DOE’s  National  Science  Bowl®  for  high  school  students.  National  Science
Bowl®  events for high school and middle school students, which will involve 17,000
students across the Nation this year, provide prestigious academic competitions that
challenge and inspire the Nation’s youth to excel in math and science.
SCIENCE ACCOMPLISHMENTS

For  more  than  50  years,  the  Office  of  Science  (SC)  has  balanced  basic  research,
innovative problem-solving, and support for world-leading scientific capabilities, en-
abling  historic  contributions  to  U.S.  economic  and  scientific  preeminence.  American
taxpayers have received good value for their investment in basic research sponsored
by  the  Office  of  Science;  this  work  has  led  to  significant  technological  innovations,
new  intellectual  capital,  improved  quality  of  life,  and  enhanced  economic  competi-
tiveness. The following are some of the past year’s highlights:

Nobel  Prize  in  Physics.  The  2006  Nobel  Prize  in  physics  was  awarded  to  Dr.
George Smoot (DOE Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and University of Cali-
fornia,  Berkeley)  and  Dr.  John  Mather  (NASA  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center)  for
their discovery of ‘‘the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave back-
ground  radiation,’’  the  pattern  of  minuscule  temperature  variations  in  radiation
which allowed scientists to gain better understanding of the origins of galaxies and
stars.  These  two  American  scientists  led  the  teams  of  researchers  who  worked  on
the  historic  1989  NASA  COBE  satellite.  The  results  of  their  work  provided  in-
creased support for the ‘‘Big Bang’’ theory of the universe and marked the inception
of cosmology as a precise science. SC supported Dr. Smoot’s research during the pe-
riod in which he worked on the COBE experiment, and continues to support his re-
search  today.  One  of  the  principal  instruments  used  to  make  the  discoveries  was
built  at  SC-supported  facilities  at  Lawrence  Berkeley  National  Laboratory  and

DOE’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center supercomputers were
used to analyze the massive amounts of data and produce detailed visual maps.

Advancing  Science  and  Technology  for  Bioenergy  Solutions.  Harnessing  the  capa-
bilities  of  microbes  and  plants  holds  great  potential  for  the  development  of  innova-
tive, cost-effective methods for the production of biofuels and bioenergy. Sequencing
of  the  poplar  tree  genome  was  completed  as  part  of  a  DOE  national  laboratory-led
international  collaboration;  the  information  encoded  in  the  poplar  genome  will  pro-
vide researchers with an important resource for developing trees that produce more
biomass  for  conversion  to  biofuels  and  trees  that  can  sequester  more  carbon  from
the  atmosphere.  The  DOE  Joint  Genome  Institute  (JGI)  marked  a  technical  mile-
stone  this  year  with  the  100th  microbe  genome  sequenced;  Methanosarcina  barkeri
fusaro  is  capable  of  living  in  diverse  and  extreme  environments,  produces  methane
from  digesting  cellulose  and  other  complex  sugars,  and  provides  greater  under-
standing  of  potential  new  methods  for  producing  renewable  sources  of  energy.  A
chemical  imaging  method  developed  using  a  light-producing  cellulose  synthesizing
enzyme  allowed  researchers  to  observe  the  enzyme  as  it  deposited  cellulose  fibers
in a cell, providing greater understanding of the mechanism for cellulose formation.
Delivering Forefront Computational and Networking Capabilities for Science. Sev-
eral  2006  advances  in  computing,  computational  sciences,  and  networking  enabled
greater  opportunities  for  computational  research  and  effective  management  of  data
collected at DOE scientific user facilities. NERSC began to increase its peak capac-
ity  by  a  factor  of  100  and  the  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  (ORNL)  Leadership
Computing  Facility  doubled  its  capability  to  54  teraflops  to  provide  additional  re-
sources for computationally intensive, large-scale projects. The Energy Sciences Net-
work expanded in 2006 to include the Chicago and New York-Long Island metropoli-
tan area networks (MANs), bringing dual connectivity at 20 gigabits per second and
highly  reliable,  advanced  network  services  to  accommodate  next-generation  sci-
entific  instruments  and  supercomputers.  Chemistry  software  using  parallel-vector
algorithms  developed  by  researchers  at  ORNL  has  enabled  computations  40  times
more  complex  and  100  times  faster  than  previous  state-of-the-art  codes.  The  devel-
opment of a multi-scale mathematical framework for simulating the process of self-
organization in biological systems has led to the discovery of a previously unidenti-
fied cluster state, providing possible applications to modeling microbial populations.
Advances  in  Basic  Science  for  Energy  Technologies.  Current  and  future  national
energy  challenges  may  be  partially  addressed  through  scientific  and  technological
innovation. Some recent accomplishments in basic science that may contribute to fu-
ture  energy  solutions  include  the  following.  Basic  research  on  the  molecular  design
and  synthesis  of  new  polymer  membranes  has  lead  to  the  discovery  of  a  new  fuel
cell  membrane  that  is  longer  lasting  and  three  times  more  proton  conductive  than
the  current  gold  standard  for  proton  exchange  membrane  fuel  cells.  Computational
studies  showing  that  in  titanium-coated  carbon  nanotubes  a  single  titanium  atom
can  adsorb  four  hydrogen  molecules  opens  new  ways  that  the  control  of  matter  on
the  nanoscale  can  lead  to  the  creation  of  novel  materials  for  hydrogen  storage.  Re-
cent work demonstrating that visible light can split carbon dioxide into carbon mon-
oxide  and  a  free  oxygen  atom,  the  critical  first  reaction  in  sunlight-driven  trans-
formation  of  carbon  dioxide  into  methanol,  makes  it  feasible  to  consider  harnessing
sunlight  to  drive  the  photocatalytic  production  of  methanol  from  carbon  dioxide.
Demonstration of the effect known as carrier multiplication in which a single photon
creates  multiple  charge  carriers  during  the  interaction  of  photons  with  a
nanocrystalline  sample  could  lead  to  substantial  increases  in  solar  cell  conversion
efficiency.

Maintaining  World-leading  Research  Tools  for  U.S.  Science.  The  Office  of  Science
continues  to  construct  and  maintain  powerful  tools  and  research  capabilities  that
will  accelerate  U.S.  scientific  discovery  and  innovation.  The  following  highlight  a
few recent accomplishments. Construction and commissioning of the Spallation Neu-
tron  Source  (SNS),  an  accelerator-based  neutron  source  that  will  provide  the  most
intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and industrial de-
velopment,  was  completed  and  began  operations.  Full  operation  of  four  of  the  five
DOE  Nanoscale  Science  Research  Centers  began  in  2006,  providing  resources  un-
matched  anywhere  in  the  world  for  the  synthesis,  fabrication,  and  analysis  of
nanoparticles  and  nanomaterials.  A  nanofocusing  lens  device  at  the  Advanced  Pho-
ton Source at Argonne National Laboratory has set a world’s record for line size res-
olution  produced  with  a  hard  x-ray  beam  and  enables  such  capabilities  as  three-di-
mensional visualization of electronic circuit boards, mapping impurities in biological
and  environmental  samples,  and  analyzing  samples  inside  high-pressure  or  high-
temperature  cells.  A  new  record  for  performance,  a  77  percent  increase  in  peak  lu-
minosity in 2006 from the previous year, was achieved at the Tevatron, the world’s
most  powerful  particle  collider  for  high  energy  physics  research  at  Fermilab.  Evi-

dence  of  the  rare  single  top  quark  was  observed  at  Fermilab  in  2006,  bringing  re-
searchers a step closer to finding the Higgs boson. The Large Area Telescope (LAT),
a DOE and NASA partnership and the primary instrument on NASA’s GLAST mis-
sion,  was  completed  in  2006  and  will  be  placed  in  orbit  in  the  fall  of  2007  to  study
the  high  energy  gamma  rays  and  other  astrophysical  phenomena  using  particle
physics  detection  techniques.  During  the  2006  operation  of  the  Relativistic  Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC), polarized protons were accelerated to the highest energies ever
recorded—250 billion electron volts—for world-leading studies of the internal quark-
gluon structure of nucleons.
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE

The  path  from  basic  research  to  technology  development  and  industrial  competi-
tiveness  is  not  always  obvious.  History  has  taught  us  that  seeking  answers  to  fun-
damental questions can ultimately result in a diverse array of practical applications
as  well  as  some  remarkable  revolutionary  advances.  Working  with  the  scientific
community,  the  Office  of  Science  invests  in  the  promising  research  and  sets  long-
term  scientific  goals  with  ambitious  annual  targets.  The  intent  and  impact  of  our
performance goals may not always be clear to those outside the research community.
Therefore  the  Office  of  Science  has  created  a  website  (www.sc.doe.gov/measures)  to
better  communicate  to  the  public  what  we  are  measuring  and  why  it  is  important.
Further,  the  Office  of  Science  has  revised  the  appraisal  process  it  uses  each  year
to evaluate the scientific, management, and operational performance of the contrac-
tors  who  manage  and  operate  each  of  its  10  national  laboratories.  This  new  ap-
praisal  process  went  into  effect  for  the  FY  2006  performance  evaluation  period  and
provides a common structure and scoring system across all 10 Office of Science lab-
oratories. The performance-based approach focuses the evaluation of the contractor’s
performance  against  eight  Performance  Goals  (three  Science  and  Technology  Goals
and  five  Management  and  Operation  Goals).  Each  goal  is  composed  of  two  or  more
weighted objectives. The new process has also incorporated a standardized five-point
(0–4.3)  scoring  system,  with  corresponding  grades  for  each  Performance  Goal,  cre-
ating a ‘‘Report Card’’ for each laboratory.

The  FY  2006  Office  of  Science  laboratory  report  cards  have  been  posted  on  the

SCIENCE PROGRAMS
BASIC ENERGY SCIENCES
FY 2007 Request—$1,421.0 Million; FY 2008 Request—$1,498.5 Million

Basic  research  supported  by  the  Basic  Energy  Sciences  (BES)  program  touches
virtually  every  aspect  of  energy  resources,  production,  conversion,  efficiency,  and
waste mitigation. Research in materials sciences and engineering leads to the devel-
opment  of  materials  that  may  improve  the  efficiency,  economy,  environmental  ac-
ceptability,  and  safety  of  energy  generation,  conversion,  transmission,  and  use.  Re-
search in chemistry leads to the development of advances such as efficient combus-
tion  systems  with  reduced  emission  of  pollutants;  new  solar  photo-conversion  proc-
esses; improved catalysts for the production of fuels and chemicals; and better sepa-
rations  and  analytical  methods  for  applications  in  energy  processes,  environmental
remediation, and waste management. Research in geosciences contributes to the so-
lution of problems in multiple DOE mission areas, including reactive fluid flow stud-
ies to understand contaminant remediation and seismic imaging for reservoir defini-
tion.  Research  in  the  molecular  and  biochemical  nature  of  photosynthesis  aids  the
development of solar photo-energy conversion and biomass conversion methods. BES
asks  researchers  to  reach  far  beyond  today’s  problems  in  order  to  provide  the  basis
for  long-term  solutions  to  what  is  one  of  society’s  greatest  challenges—a  secure,
abundant,  and  clean  energy  supply.  In  FY  2008,  the  Office  of  Science  will  support
expanded  efforts  in  basic  research  related  to  transformational  energy  technologies.
Within BES, there are increases to ongoing basic research for the hydrogen economy
and effective solar energy utilization. The FY 2008 budget request also supports in-
creased  research  in  electric-energy  storage,  accelerator  physics,  and  X-ray  and  neu-
tron detector research.

BES also provides the Nation’s researchers with world-class research facilities, in-
cluding reactor- and accelerator-based neutron sources, light sources (soon to include
an X-ray free electron laser), nanoscale science research centers, and electron beam
micro-characterization  centers.  These  facilities  provide  outstanding  capabilities  for
imaging and characterizing materials of all kinds from metals, alloys, and ceramics
to fragile biological samples. The next steps in the characterization and the ultimate
control of materials properties and chemical reactivity are to improve spatial resolu-

tion  of  imaging  techniques;  to  enable  a  wide  variety  of  samples,  sample  sizes,  and
sample  environments  to  be  used  in  imaging  experiments;  and  to  make  measure-
ments  on  very  short  time  scales,  comparable  to  the  time  of  a  chemical  reaction  or
the  formation  of  a  chemical  bond.  With  these  tools,  we  will  be  able  to  understand
how  the  composition  of  materials  affects  their  properties,  to  watch  proteins  fold,  to
see  chemical  reactions,  and  to  understand  and  observe  the  nature  of  the  chemical
bond.  For  FY  2008,  BES  scientific  user  facilities  will  be  scheduled  to  operate  at  an
optimal number of hours.

Construction  of  the  Spallation  Neutron  Source  (SNS)  was  completed  in  FY  2006
ahead  of  schedule,  under  budget,  and  meeting  all  technical  milestones.  In  FY  2008
fabrication  and  commissioning  of  SNS  instruments  will  continue,  funded  by  BES
and  other  sources  including  non-DOE  sources,  and  will  continue  to  increase  power
towards full levels. Two Major Items of Equipment are funded in FY 2008 that will
allow  the  fabrication  of  approximately  nine  to  ten  additional  instruments  for  the
SNS,  thus  nearly  completing  the  initial  suite  of  24  instruments  that  can  be  accom-
modated in the high-power target station.

All five Nanoscale Science Research Centers will be fully operational in FY 2008:
the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the
Molecular  Foundry  at  Lawrence  Berkeley  National  Laboratory,  the  Center  for
Nanoscale  Materials  at  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  the  Center  for  Integrated
Nanotechnologies at Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Labora-
tory, and the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Labora-
tory.  In  FY  2008,  funding  for  research  at  the  nanoscale  increases  for  activities  re-
lated to the hydrogen economy and solar energy utilization.

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen-
ter  (SLAC)  will  continue  construction  at  the  planned  levels  in  FY  2008.  Funding  is
also  provided  for  primary  support  of  the  operation  of  the  SLAC  linac.  This  marks
the  third  year  of  the  transition  of  linac  funding  from  the  High  Energy  Physics  pro-
gram to the Basic Energy Sciences program. The purpose of the LCLS Project is to
provide  laser-like  radiation  in  the  X-ray  region  of  the  spectrum  that  is  10  billion
times  greater  in  peak  power  and  peak  brightness  than  any  existing  coherent  X-ray
light  source  and  that  has  pulse  lengths  measured  in  femtoseconds—the  timescale
of  electronic  and  atomic  motions.  The  LCLS  will  be  the  first  such  facility  in  the
world for ground-breaking research in the physical and life sciences. Funding is pro-
vided  separately  for  design  and  fabrication  of  instruments  for  the  facility.  Project
Engineering  and  Design  (PED)  and  construction  for  the  Photon  Ultra-fast  Laser
Science  and  Engineering  (PULSE)  building  renovation  begins  in  FY  2008.  PULSE
is  a  new  center  for  ultra-fast  science  at  SLAC  focusing  on  ultra-fast  structural  and
electronic dynamics in materials sciences, the generation of attosecond laser pulses,
single-molecule  imaging,  and  understanding  solar  energy  conversion  in  molecular
systems.  Support  continues  for  PED  and  R&D  for  the  National  Synchrotron  Light
Source-II  (NSLS–II),  which  would  be  a  new  synchrotron  light  source,  highly  opti-
mized to deliver ultra-high brightness and flux and exceptional beam stability. This
would  enable  the  study  of  material  properties  and  functions  with  a  spatial  resolu-
tion of one nanometer (nm), an energy resolution of 0.1 millielectron volt (meV), and
the ultra-high sensitivity required to perform spectroscopy on a single atom, achiev-
ing  a  level  of  detail  and  precision  never  possible  before.  NSLS–II  would  open  new
regimes of scientific discovery and investigation.

The Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program is a set
of  coordinated  investments  across  all  Office  of  Science  mission  areas  with  the  goal
of  using  computer  simulation  to  achieve  breakthrough  scientific  advances  that  are
impossible  using  theoretical  or  laboratory  studies  alone.  The  SciDAC  program  in
BES consists of two activities: (1) characterizing chemically reacting flows as exem-
plified  by  combustion  and  (2)  achieving  scalability  in  the  first-principles  calculation
of molecular properties, including chemical reaction rates.
ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING RESEARCH
FY 2007 Request—$318.7 Million; FY 2008 Request—$340.2 Million

The  Advanced  Scientific  Computing  Research  (ASCR)  program  is  expanding  the
capability  of  world-class  scientific  research  through  advances  in  mathematics,  high
performance computing and advanced networks, and through the application of com-
puters capable of many trillions of operations per second (terascale to petascale com-
puters). Computer-based simulation can enable us to understand and predict the be-
havior  of  complex  systems  that  are  beyond  the  reach  of  our  most  powerful  experi-
mental  probes  or  our  most  sophisticated  theories.  Computational  modeling  has
greatly  advanced  our  understanding  of  fundamental  processes  of  nature,  such  as
fluid flow and turbulence or molecular structure and reactivity. Soon, through mod-

eling  and  simulation,  we  will  be  able  to  explore  the  interior  of  stars  to  understand
how  the  chemical  elements  were  created  and  learn  how  protein  machines  work  in-
side  living  cells  to  enable  the  design  of  microbes  that  address  critical  energy  or
waste  cleanup  needs.  We  could  also  design  novel  catalysts  and  high-efficiency  en-
gines  that  expand  our  economy,  lower  pollution,  and  reduce  our  dependence  on  for-
eign oil. Computational science is increasingly important to making progress at the
frontiers  of  almost  every  scientific  discipline  and  to  our  most  challenging  feats  of
engineering. Leadership in scientific computing has become a cornerstone of the De-
partment’s  strategy  to  ensure  the  security  of  the  Nation  and  success  in  its  science,
energy, environmental quality, and national security missions.

The demands of today’s facilities, which generate millions of gigabytes of data per
year, now outstrip the capabilities of the current Internet design and push the state-
of-the-art  in  data  storage  and  utilization.  But,  the  evolution  of  the  telecommuni-
cations  market,  including  the  availability  of  direct  access  to  optical  fiber  at  attrac-
tive prices and the availability of flexible dense wave division multiplexing (DWDM)
products gives SC the possibility of exploiting these technologies to provide scientific
data  where  needed  at  speeds  commensurate  with  the  new  data  volumes.  To  take
advantage of this opportunity, the Energy Science Network (ESnet) has entered into
a long-term partnership with Internet 2 to build the next generation optical network
infrastructure needed for U.S. science. To fully realize the potential for science, how-
ever, significant research is needed to integrate these capabilities, make them avail-
able  to  scientists,  and  build  the  infrastructure  which  can  provide  cyber  security.
ASCR is leading an interagency effort to develop a Federal Plan for Advanced Net-
working  R&D.  This  plan  will  provide  a  strategy  for  addressing  current  and  future
networking needs of the Federal Government in support of science and national se-
curity  missions  and  provide  a  process  for  developing  a  more  detailed  roadmap  to
guide future multi-agency investments in advancing networking R&D.

ASCR supports core research in applied mathematics, computer sciences, and dis-
tributed network environments. The applied mathematics research activity produces
fundamental  mathematical  methods  to  model  complex  physical  and  biological  sys-
tems.  The  computer  science  research  efforts  enable  scientists  to  perform  scientific
computations  efficiently  on  the  highest  performance  computers  available  and  to
store, manage, analyze, and visualize the massive amounts of data that result. The
networking research activity provides the techniques to link the data producers with
scientists who need access to the data. Results from enabling research supported by
ASCR  are  used  by  scientists  supported  by  other  SC  programs.  This  link  to  other
DOE programs provides a tangible assessment of the value of ASCR’s core research
program for advancing scientific discovery and technology development through sim-
ulations.  In  FY  2008  expanded  efforts  in  applied  mathematics  will  support  critical
long-term  mathematical  research  issues  relevant  to  petascale  science,  multi-scale
mathematics, and optimized control and risk analysis in complex systems. Expanded
efforts  in  computer  science  will  enable  scientific  applications  to  take  full  advantage
of petascale computing systems at the Leadership Computing Facilities.

In  addition  to  its  research  activities,  ASCR  plans,  develops,  and  operates  super-
computer  and  network  facilities  that  are  available  24  hours  a  day,  365  days  a  year
to  researchers  working  on  problems  relevant  to  DOE’s  scientific  missions.  Invest-
ments  in  the  ESnet  will  provide  the  DOE  science  community  with  capabilities  not
available  through  commercial  networks  or  the  commercial  Internet  to  manage  in-
creased data flows from petascale computers and experimental facilities. In FY 2008
ESnet  will  deliver  a  10  gigabit  per  second  (gbps)  core  Internet  service  as  well  as
a  Science  Data  Network  with  20  gbps  on  its  northern  route  and  10  gbps  on  its
southern route. Delivery of the next generation of high performance resources at the
National  Energy  Research  Scientific  Computing  Center  (NERSC)  is  scheduled  for
FY  2007.  This  NERSC–5  system  is  expected  to  provide  100–150  teraflops  of  peak
computing  capacity.  The  NERSC  computational  resources  are  integrated  by  a  com-
mon  high  performance  file  storage  system  that  enables  users  to  use  all  machines
easily. Therefore the new machine will significantly reduce the current oversubscrip-
tion at NERSC which serves nearly 2,000 scientists annually.

In  FY  2008,  the  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  (ORNL)  Leadership  Computing
Facility (LCF) will continue to provide world leading high performance sustained ca-
pability  to  researchers  through  the  Innovative  and  Novel  Computational  Impact  on
Theory  and  Experiment  (INCITE)  program.  The  acquisition  of  a  250  teraflop  Cray
Baker  system  by  the  end  of  FY  2008  will  enable  further  scientific  advancements  in
areas such as combustion simulation for clean coal research, simulation of fusion de-
vices that approach ITER scale, and quantum calculations of complex chemical reac-
tions. In addition, further diversity with the LCF resources will be realized with an
acquisition by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) of a high performance IBM Blue
Gene/P  with  low-electrical  power  requirements  and  a  peak  capability  of  up  to  100

teraflops in 2007, and further expansion to 250–500 teraflops in FY 2008 will bring
enhanced  capability  to  accelerate  scientific  understanding  in  areas  such  as  molec-
ular  dynamics,  catalysis,  protein/DNA  complexes,  and  aging  of  material.  With  the
ORNL and ANL LCF facilities SC is developing a multiple set of computer architec-
tures  to  enable  the  most  efficient  solution  of  critical  problems  across  the  spectrum
of science, ranging from biology to physics and chemistry.

The Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program is a set
of  coordinated  investments  across  all  SC  mission  areas  with  the  goal  of  using  com-
puter  simulation  and  advanced  networking  technologies  to  achieve  breakthrough
scientific  advances  via  that  are  impossible  using  theoretical  or  laboratory  studies
alone.  In  FY  2006  ASCR  recompeted  its  SciDAC  portfolio,  with  the  exception  of  ac-
tivities in partnership with the Fusion Energy Sciences program that were initiated
in  FY  2005.  The  new  portfolio,  referred  to  as  SciDAC–2,  enables  new  areas  of
science  through  Scientific  Application  Partnerships;  Centers  for  Enabling  Tech-
nologies (CET) at universities and national laboratories; and University-led SciDAC
Institutes  to  establish  centers  of  excellence  that  complement  the  activities  of  the
CETs and provide training for the next generation of computational scientists.

Advancing  high  performance  computing  and  computation  is  a  highly  coordinated
interagency effort. ASCR has extensive partnerships with other federal agencies and
the  National  Nuclear  Security  Administration  (NNSA).  Activities  are  coordinated
with other federal efforts through the Networking and Information Technology R&D
(NITR&D) subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council Committee
on  Technology.  The  subcommittee  coordinates  planning,  budgeting,  and  assessment
activities  of  the  multi-agency  NITR&D  enterprise.  DOE  has  been  an  active  partici-
pant  in  these  coordination  groups  and  committees  since  their  inception.  ASCR  will
continue to coordinate its activities through these mechanisms and will lead the de-
velopment  of  new  coordinating  mechanisms  as  needs  arise  such  as  the  ongoing  de-
velopment of a Federal Plan for Advanced Networking R&D.
BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
FY 2007 Request—$510.3 Million; FY 2008 Request—$531.9 Million

Biological and Environmental Research (BER) supports basic research with broad
impacts  on  our  energy  future,  our  environment,  and  our  health.  By  understanding
complex  biological  systems,  developing  computational  tools  to  model  and  predict
their  behavior,  and  developing  methods  to  harness  nature’s  capabilities,  bio-
technology solutions are possible for DOE energy, environmental, and national secu-
rity  challenges.  An  ability  to  predict  long-range  and  regional  climate  enables  effec-
tive  planning  for  future  needs  in  energy,  agriculture,  and  land  and  water  use.  Un-
derstanding  the  global  carbon  cycle  and  the  associated  role  and  capabilities  of  mi-
crobes  and  plants  can  lead  to  solutions  for  reducing  carbon  dioxide  concentrations
in  the  atmosphere.  Understanding  the  complex  role  of  biology,  geochemistry,  and
hydrology beneath the Earth’s surface will lead to improved decision-making and so-
lutions for contaminated DOE weapons sites. Understanding the biological effects of
low doses of radiation can lead to the development of science-based health risk pol-
icy  to  better  protect  workers  and  citizens.  Both  normal  and  abnormal  physiological
processes—from normal human development to cancer to brain function—can be un-
derstood and improved using radiotracers, advanced imaging instruments, and novel
biomedical devices.

The  FY  2008  BER  request  continues  expansion  of  the  Genomics:  GTL  program.
This program employs a systems approach to biology at the interface of the biologi-
cal, physical, and computational sciences to determine the diverse biochemical capa-
bilities  of  microbes,  microbial  communities,  and  plants,  with  the  goal  of  tailoring
and translating those capabilities into solutions for DOE mission needs. In FY 2005
BER  engaged  a  committee  of  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  of  the  National
Academies  to  review  the  design  of  the  Genomics:  GTL  program  and  its  infrastruc-
ture  plan.  The  NRC  committee  report,  Review  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s
Genomics:  GTL  Program  was  released  in  FY  2006  and  provided  a  strong  endorse-
ment of the GTL program, recommending that the program’s focus on systems biol-
ogy  for  bioenergy,  carbon  sequestration,  and  bioremediation  be  given  a  ‘‘high  pri-
ority’’  by  DOE  and  the  Nation.  The  report  also  recommended  that  the  program’s
plan  for  new  research  facilities  be  reshaped  to  produce  earlier  and  more  cost-effec-
tive results by focusing not on particular technologies, but on research underpinning
particular  applications  such  as  bioenergy,  carbon  sequestration,  or  environmental
remediation.

In  response,  SC  revised  its  original  single-purpose  user  facilities  plan  to  instead
develop  and  support  vertically-integrated  GTL  Research  Centers  to  accelerate  sys-
tems  biology  research.  BER  will  support  the  development  of  three  Bioenergy  Re-

search Centers to be selected and initiated in FY 2007, and fully operational by the
end  of  2008.  All  three  centers  will  conduct  comprehensive,  multidisciplinary  re-
search  programs  focused  on  microbes  and  plants  to  drive  scientific  breakthroughs
necessary  for  the  development  of  cost-effective  biofuels  and  bioenergy  production.
These centers will not only possess the robust scientific capabilities needed to carry
out  their  broad  mission  mandates,  but  will  also  draw  upon  the  broader  GTL  pro-
gram  for  technology  development  and  foundational  research.  The  vertically-inte-
grated  GTL  Research  Centers  will  not  require  construction  of  facilities.  Moreover,
the competition to establish and operate them is open to universities, non-profit re-
search organizations, the national laboratories, and the private sector—an approach
that  is  new  for  the  Department.  The  first  three  research  centers  will  focus  on  bio-
energy research. The Department announced the solicitation for Bioenergy Research
Centers in August 2006, and proposals were due on February 1, 2007.

Development  of  a  global  biotechnology  based  energy  infrastructure  requires  a
science  base  that  will  enable  scientists  to  control  or  redirect  genetic  regulation  and
redesign  specific  proteins,  biochemical  pathways,  and  even  entire  plants  or  mi-
crobes. Renewable biofuels could be produced using plants, microbes, or isolated en-
zymes. Understanding the biological mechanisms involved in these energy producing
processes  will  allow  scientists  and  technologists  to  design  novel  biofuel  production
strategies  involving  both  cellular  and  cell  free  systems  that  might  include  defined
mixed  microbial  communities  or  consolidated  biological  processes.  Within  the
Genomics: GTL program, BER supports basic research aimed at developing the un-
derstanding needed to advance biotechnology-based strategies for biofuel production,
focusing on renewable, carbon-neutral energy compounds like ethanol and hydrogen,
as well as understanding how the capabilities of microbes can be applied to environ-
mental remediation and carbon sequestration.

In  2003,  the  Administration  launched  the  Climate  Change  Research  Initiative
(CCRI) to focus research on areas where substantial progress in understanding and
predicting  climate  change,  including  its  potential  causes  and  consequences,  is  pos-
sible over the next five years. In FY 2008, BER will contribute to the CCRI by focus-
ing on (1) helping to resolve the North American carbon sink question (i.e., the mag-
nitude  and  location  of  the  North  American  carbon  sink);  (2)  deployment  and  oper-
ation  of  a  mobile  ARM  facility  to  provide  data  on  the  effects  of  clouds  and  aerosols
on  the  atmospheric  radiation  budget  in  regions  and  locations  of  opportunity  where
data are lacking or sparse; (3) using advanced climate models to simulate potential
effects of natural and human-induced climate forcing on global and regional climate
and  the  potential  effects  on  climate  of  alternative  options  for  mitigating  increases
in  human  forcing  of  climate,  including  abrupt  climate  change;  and  (4)  developing
and  evaluating  assessment  tools  needed  to  study  costs  and  benefits  of  potential
strategies for reducing net carbon dioxide emissions.

In FY 2008, BER will continue to support research aimed at advancing the science
of  climate  and  Earth  system  modeling  by  coupling  models  of  different  components
of the earth system related to climate and by significantly increasing the spatial res-
olution  of  such  models.  SciDAC-enabled  activities  will  allow  climate  scientists  to
gain  unprecedented  insights  into  interactions  and  feedbacks  between,  for  example,
climate  change  and  global  cycling  of  carbon,  the  potential  effects  of  carbon  dioxide
and aerosol emissions from energy production and their impact on the global climate
system. BER will also add a SciDAC component to GTL and Environmental Remedi-
ation research. GTL SciDAC will initiate new research to develop mathematical and
computational tools needed for complex biological system modeling and for analysis
of complex data sets, such as mass spectrometry metabolomic or proteomic profiling
data.  Environmental  Remediation  SciDAC  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  sub-
surface  and  computational  scientists  to  develop  and  improve  methods  of  simulating
subsurface reactive transport processes on ‘‘discovery class’’ computers.

Research  emphasis  within  BER’s  Environmental  Remediation  Sciences  subpro-
gram will focus on issues of subsurface cleanup such as defining and understanding
the  processes  that  control  contaminant  fate  and  transport  in  the  environment  and
providing  opportunities  for  use  or  manipulation  of  natural  processes  to  alter  con-
taminant mobility. In FY 2008, BER will support the development of two additional
field  research  sites  (for  a  total  of  three),  providing  opportunities  to  validate  labora-
tory findings under field conditions. The resulting knowledge and technology will as-
sist  DOE’s  environmental  clean-up  and  stewardship  missions.  Funding  for  the  Wil-
liam  R.  Wiley  Environmental  Molecular  Sciences  Laboratory  (EMSL)  at  Pacific
Northwest  National  Laboratory  (PNNL)  will  be  increased  in  FY  2008  to  maintain
operations at full capacity.

Also continuing in FY 2008 is BER support for fundamental research in genomics,
medical  applications  and  measurement  science,  and  the  health  effects  of  low  dose
radiation in FY 2008. Resources are developed and made widely available for deter-

mining  protein  structures  at  DOE  synchrotrons,  and  for  DOE—relevant  high-
throughput  genomic  DNA  sequencing.  Building  on  DOE  capabilities  in  physics,
chemistry,  engineering,  biology  and  computation,  BER  supports  fundamental  imag-
ing  research,  maintains  core  infrastructure  for  imaging  research  and  develops  new
technologies to improve the diagnosis and treatment of psycho-neurological diseases
and cancer and to improve the function of patients with neurological disabilities like
blindness. Funding for Ethical, Legal, and Societal Issues (ELSI) associated with ac-
tivities applicable to SC, increases to support research on the ecological and environ-
mental  impacts  of  nanoparticles  resulting  from  nanotechnology  applied  to  energy
technologies.
HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
FY 2007 Request—$775.1 Million; FY 2008 Request—$782.2 Million

The  High  Energy  Physics  (HEP)  program  provides  over  90  percent  of  the  federal
support  for  the  Nation’s  high  energy  physics  research.  This  research  advances  our
understanding  of  the  basic  constituents  of  matter,  deeper  symmetries  in  the  laws
of nature at high energies, and mysterious phenomena that are commonplace in the
universe,  such  as  dark  energy  and  dark  matter.  Research  at  these  frontiers  of
science may uncover new particles, forces, or undiscovered dimensions of space and
time;  explain  how  matter  came  to  have  mass;  and  reveal  the  underlying  nature  of
the  universe.  HEP  supports  particle  accelerators  and  very  sensitive  detectors  to
study  fundamental  particle  interactions  at  the  highest  possible  energies  as  well  as
non-accelerator studies of cosmic particles using experiments conducted deep under-
ground, on mountains, or in space. These research facilities and basic research sup-
ported by HEP advance our knowledge not only in high energy physics, but increas-
ingly  in  other  fields  was  well,  including  particle  astrophysics  and  cosmology.  Re-
search  advances  in  one  field  often  have  a  strong  impact  on  research  directions  in
another. Technology that was developed in response to the pace-setting demands of
high energy physics research has also become indispensable to other fields of science
and has found wide applications in industry and medicine, often in ways that could
not have been predicted when the technology was first developed.

In FY 2008 HEP supports core experimental and theoretical research to maintain
strong  participation  in  the  Tevatron,  Large  Hadron  Collider  (LHC)  at  CERN  (the
European  Organization  for  Nuclear  Research),  and  B-factory  physics  program,  and
supports research activities associated with development of potential new initiatives
such as International Linear Collider (ILC) R&D, neutrinos, dark energy, and dark
matter.  HEP  places  a  high  priority  on  maximizing  scientific  data  derived  from  the
three  major  HEP  user  facilities:  the  Tevatron  Collider  and  Neutrinos  at  the  Main
Injector  (NuMI)  beam  line  at  Fermilab,  and  the  B-factory  at  SLAC.  HEP  will  con-
tinue  to  lead  the  international  scientific  community  with  these  world-leading  user
facilities  at  Fermilab  and  SLAC  in  FY  2008,  but  these  facilities  will  complete  their
scientific  missions  by  the  end  of  the  decade.  Thus,  the  longer-term  HEP  program
supported in FY 2008 begins to develop new cutting-edge facilities in targeted areas
(such  as  neutrino  physics)  that  will  establish  U.S.  leadership  in  these  areas  in  the
next  decade,  when  the  centerpiece  of  the  world  HEP  program  will  reside  at  CERN.
In  FY  2008  HEP  continues  to  support  software  and  computing  resources  for  U.S.
researchers  participating  in  the  LHC  program  at  CERN  as  well  as  pre-operations
and  maintenance  of  the  U.S.-built  systems  that  are  scientific  components  of  the
LHC  detectors.  R&D  in  support  of  the  proposed  ILC  is  maintained  in  FY  2008  to
support  U.S.  participation  in  a  comprehensive,  coordinated  international  R&D  pro-
gram and to provide a basis for U.S. industry to compete successfully for major sub-
system contracts, should the ILC be designed and then built. The long-term goal of
this  effort  is  to  provide  robust  cost  and  schedule  baselines  to  support  design  and
construction decisions for an international electron-positron linear collider. The ILC
would provide unprecedented power, clarity, and precision to unravel the mysteries
of  the  next  energy  frontier,  which  we  will  just  begin  to  discover  with  the  LHC.  In
2006 the ILC Reference Design Report was completed, and in FY 2007 further work
toward  the  design,  including  some  site-specific  studies  and  detector  studies,  will  be
performed. In FY 2008 further work on both accelerator systems and detector stud-
ies will be performed.

To  provide  a  nearer-term  future  HEP  program,  and  to  preserve  future  research
options,  R&D  for  accelerator  and  detector  technologies,  particularly  in  the  growing
area  of  neutrino  physics,  will  continue  in  FY  2008.  With  Tevatron  improvements
completed,  much  of  the  accelerator  development  effort  at  Fermilab  in  FY  2008  will
focus  on  the  neutrino  program  to  study  the  universe’s  most  prolific  particle.  The
Neutrinos  at  the  Main  Injector  (NuMI)  beam  allows  studies  of  the  fundamental
physics  of  neutrino  masses  and  mixings  using  the  proton  source  section  of  the

Tevatron  complex.  The  NuMI  beam  has  begun  operations  and  will  eventually  put
much  higher  demands  on  that  set  of  accelerators.  A  program  of  enhanced  mainte-
nance,  operational  improvements,  and  equipment  upgrades  is  being  developed  to
meet  these  higher  demands,  while  continuing  to  run  the  Tevatron.  Fabrication  of
the NuMI Off-axis Neutrino Appearance (NOνA) Detector, which was originally pro-
posed as a line item construction project in FY 2007 under the generic name of Elec-
tron Neutrino Appearance (EνA) Detector, is funded in FY 2008 and will utilize the
NuMI beam. This project includes improvements to the proton source to increase the
intensity of the NuMI beam. Meanwhile, fabrication will begin for the Reactor Neu-
trino  Detector  and  two  small  neutrino  experiments,  the  Main  Injector  Experiment
ν-A  (MINERνA)  in  the  MINOS  near  detector  hall  at  Fermilab  and  the  Tokai-to-
Kamioka  (T2K)  experiment  using  the  Japanese  J–PARC  neutrino  beam.  R&D  will
continue  for  a  large  double  beta  decay  experiment  to  measure  the  mass  of  a  neu-
trino.  These  efforts  are  part  of  a  coordinated  neutrino  program  developed  from  an
American  Physical  Society  study  and  a  joint  HEPAP/Nuclear  Sciences  Advisory
Committee (NSAC) subpanel review.

To exploit the unique opportunity to expand the boundaries of our understanding
of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, a high priority is given to con-
tinued  operations  and  infrastructure  support  for  the  B-factory  at  SLAC.  Final  up-
grades to the accelerator and detector are scheduled for completion in FY 2007, and
B-factory operations will conclude in FY 2008. HEP support of SLAC operations de-
creases  in  FY  2008  as  the  contribution  from  BES  increases  for  SLAC  linac  oper-
ations in preparation for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS).

As  the  Large  Hadron  Collider  (LHC)  accelerator  nears  its  turn-on  date  in  2007,
U.S.  activities  related  to  fabrication  of  detector  components  will  be  completed  and
new activities related to commissioning and pre-operations of these detectors, along
with software and computing activities needed to analyze the data, will ramp-up sig-
nificantly.  Support  of  an  effective  role  for  U.S.  research  groups  in  LHC  discoveries
will continue to be a high priority of the HEP program. R&D for possible future up-
grades to the LHC accelerator and detectors will also be pursued.

Enhanced support for R&D on ground- and space-based dark energy experimental
concepts,  begun  in  FY  2007,  will  be  continued  in  FY  2008.  These  experiments
should provide important new information about the nature of dark energy, leading
to a better understanding of the birth, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe.
For  example,  the  Super  Nova/Acceleration  Probe  (SNAP)  will  be  a  mission  concept
proposed for a potential interagency-sponsored experiment with NASA, and possibly
international partners: the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM). DOE and NASA are
jointly funding a National Academy of Sciences study to determine which of the pro-
posed  NASA  ‘‘Beyond  Einstein’’  missions  should  launch  first,  with  technical  design
of the selected proposal to begin at the end of this decade. JDEM is one of the can-
didate  missions  in  this  study.  In  FY  2008,  fabrication  for  the  Dark  Energy  Survey
Project will begin.

The HEP program re-competed its SciDAC portfolio in FY 2006. Major thrusts in
theoretical  physics,  astrophysics,  and  particle  physics  grid  technology  will  be  sup-
ported through the SciDAC program in FY 2008, as well as proposals in accelerator
modeling  and  design  to  be  selected  in  FY  2007.  These  projects  will  allow  HEP  to
use  computational  science  to  obtain  significant  new  insights  into  challenging  prob-
lems that have the greatest impact in HEP mission areas.
NUCLEAR PHYSICS
FY 2007 Request—$454.1 Million; FY 2008 Request—$471.3 Million

The  Nuclear  Physics  (NP)  program  is  the  major  sponsor  of  fundamental  nuclear
physics  research  in  the  Nation,  providing  about  90  percent  of  federal  support.  Sci-
entific  research  supported  by  NP  is  aimed  at  advancing  knowledge  and  providing
insights  into  the  nature  of  energy  and  matter  and,  in  particular,  at  investigating
the  fundamental  forces  which  hold  the  nucleus  together  and  determining  the  de-
tailed  structure  and  behavior  of  the  atomic  nuclei.  NP  builds  and  supports  world-
leading scientific facilities and state-of-the-art instrumentation to carry out its basic
research  agenda—the  study  of  the  evolution  and  structure  of  nuclear  matter  from
the  smallest  building  blocks,  quarks  and  gluons,  to  the  stable  elements  in  the  Uni-
verse created by stars, to unique isotopes created in the laboratory that exist at the
limits of stability and possess radically different properties from known matter. NP
also  trains  a  workforce  needed  to  underpin  the  Department’s  missions  for  nuclear-
related national security, energy, and environmental quality.

Key  aspects  of  NP  research  agenda  include  understanding  how  the  quarks  and
gluons combine to form the nucleons (proton and neutron), what the properties and
behavior  of  nuclear  matter  are  under  extreme  conditions  of  temperature  and  pres-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

29

sure,  and  what  the  properties  and  reaction  rates  are  for  atomic  nuclei  up  to  their
limits  of  stability.  Results  and  insight  from  these  studies  are  relevant  to  under-
standing  how  the  universe  evolved  in  its  earliest  moments,  how  the  chemical  ele-
ments were formed, and how the properties of one of nature’s basic constituents, the
neutrino,  influences  astrophysics  phenomena  such  as  supernovae.  Knowledge  and
techniques  developed  in  pursuit  of  fundamental  nuclear  physics  research  are  also
extensively utilized in our society today. The understanding of nuclear spin enabled
the  development  of  magnetic  resonance  imaging  for  medical  use.  Radioactive  iso-
topes  produced  by  accelerators  and  reactors  are  used  for  medical  imaging,  cancer
therapy,  and  biochemical  studies.  Advances  in  cutting-edge  instrumentation  devel-
oped  for  nuclear  physics  experiments  have  relevance  to  technological  needs  in  com-
bating  terrorism.  The  highly  trained  scientific  and  technical  personnel  in  funda-
mental nuclear physics who are a product of the program are a valuable human re-
source for many applied fields.

The FY 2008 budget request supports operations of the four National User Facili-
ties  and  research  at  universities  and  laboratories,  and  makes  investments  in  new
capabilities to address compelling scientific opportunities and to maintain U.S. com-
petitiveness in global nuclear physics efforts. In FY 2008 support continues for R&D
on  rare  isotope  beam  development,  relevant  to  the  next-generation  facilities  that
will provide capabilities for forefront nuclear structure and astrophysics studies and
for understanding the origin of the elements from iron to uranium.

When  the  Universe  was  a  millionth  of  a  second  old,  nuclear  matter  is  believed
to have existed in its most extreme energy density form called the quark-gluon plas-
ma.  Experiments  at  the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider  (RHIC)  at  Brookhaven  Na-
tional  Laboratory  (BNL)  are  searching  to  find  and  characterize  this  new  state  and
others  that  may  have  existed  during  the  first  moments  of  the  Universe.  These  ef-
forts  will  continue  in  FY  2008.  The  NP  program,  together  with  the  National  Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA), will continue construction of a new Elec-
tron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) to provide RHIC with more cost-effective, reliable, and
versatile  operations.  Research  and  development  activities,  including  the  develop-
ment of an innovative electron beam cooling system for RHIC, are expected to dem-
onstrate  the  feasibility  of  increasing  the  luminosity  (or  collision  rate)  of  the  circu-
lating  beams  by  a  factor  of  ten,  which  would  increase  the  long-term  scientific  pro-
ductivity  and  international  competitiveness  of  the  facility.  Support  for  participation
in the heavy ion program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN allows U.S.
researchers  the  opportunity  to  search  for  new  states  of  matter  under  substantially
different  initial  conditions  than  those  provided  at  RHIC.  The  interplay  of  the  dif-
ferent  research  programs  at  the  LHC  and  the  ongoing  RHIC  program  will  allow  a
detailed  tomography  of  the  hot,  dense  matter  as  it  evolves  from  the  ‘‘perfect  fluid’’
(a fluid with zero viscosity) discovered at RHIC.

Operations  of  the  Continuous  Electron  Beam  Accelerator  Facility  (CEBAF)  at
Thomas  Jefferson  National  Accelerator  Facility  (TJNAF)  in  FY  2008  will  continue
to advance our knowledge of the internal structure of protons and neutrons. By pro-
viding  precision  experimental  information  concerning  the  quarks  and  gluons  that
form  protons  and  neutrons,  the  approximately  1,200  experimental  researchers  who
use  CEBAF,  together  with  researchers  in  nuclear  theory,  seek  to  provide  a  quan-
titative  description  of  nuclear  matter  in  terms  of  the  fundamental  theory  of  the
strong  interaction,  Quantum  Chromodynamics  (QCD).  In  FY  2008,  the  accelerator
will  provide  beams  simultaneously  to  all  three  experimental  halls  and  funding  is
provided  for  engineering  design  activities  for  the  12  GeV  CEBAF  Upgrade  Project.
This  upgrade  is  one  of  the  highest  priorities  for  NP  and  would  allow  for  a  test  of
a  proposed  mechanism  of  ‘‘quark  confinement,’’  one  of  the  compelling,  unanswered
puzzles of physics.

Efforts  at  the  Argonne  Tandem  Linear  Accelerator  System  (ATLAS)  at  ANL  and
the  Holifield  Radioactive  Ion  Beam  Facility  (HRIBF)  at  ORNL  will  be  supported  in
FY  2008  to  focus  on  investigating  new  regions  of  nuclear  structure,  studying  inter-
actions in nuclear matter like those occurring in neutron stars, and determining the
reactions  that  created  the  nuclei  of  the  chemical  elements  inside  stars  and
supernovae.  The  GRETINA  gamma-ray  tracking  array,  which  continues  fabrication
in  FY  2008,  will  revolutionize  gamma  ray  detection  technology  and  offer  dramati-
cally  improved  capabilities  to  study  the  structure  of  nuclei  at  ATLAS,  HRIBF,  and
elsewhere.  The  Fundamental  Neutron  Physics  Beamline  (FNPB)  under  fabrication
at the SNS will provide a world-class capability to study the fundamental properties
of the neutron, leading to a refined characterization of the weak force. Support con-
tinues  in  FY  2008  for  the  fabrication  of  a  neutron  Electric  Dipole  Moment  experi-
ment,  to  be  sited  at  the  FNPB,  in  the  search  for  new  physics  beyond  the  Standard
Model.

Funds  are  provided  in  FY  2008  to  initiate  U.S.  participation  in  the  fabrication  of
an  Italian-led  neutrino-less  double  beta  decay  experiment,  the  Cryogenic  Under-
ground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE). A successful search for neutrino-less
beta  decay  will  determine  if  the  neutrino  is  its  own  antiparticle  and  provide  infor-
mation about the mass of the neutrino. Neutrinos are thought to play a critical role
in the explosions of supernovae and the evolution of the cosmos. A successful search
for  neutrino-less  beta  decay  will  determine  if  the  neutrino  is  its  own  antiparticle
and provide information about the mass of the neutrino.

Following  the  re-competition  of  SciDAC  projects  in  FY  2006,  NP  currently  sup-
ports  efforts  in  nuclear  astrophysics,  grid  computing,  Lattice  Gauge  (QCD)  theory,
and low energy nuclear structure and nuclear reaction theory. NP is also supporting
R&D in an international effort to develop a larger, more sensitive neutrino-less beta
decay experiment.
FUSION ENERGY SCIENCES
FY 2007 Request—$319.0 Million; FY 2008 Request—$427.9 Million

The  Fusion  Energy  Sciences  (FES)  program  advances  the  theoretical  and  experi-
mental  understanding  of  plasma  and  fusion  science,  including  a  close  collaboration
with  international  partners  in  identifying  and  exploring  plasma  and  fusion  physics
issues through specialized facilities. The FES program supports research in plasma
science, magnetically confined plasmas, advances in tokamak design, innovative con-
finement  options,  non-neutral  plasma  physics  and  high  energy  density  laboratory
plasmas (HEDLP), and cutting edge technologies. FES also leads U.S. participation
in  ITER,  an  experiment  to  study  and  demonstrate  the  sustained  burning  of  fusion
fuel. This international collaboration will provide an unparalleled scientific research
opportunity  with  a  goal  of  demonstrating  the  scientific  and  technical  feasibility  of
fusion  power.  Fusion  is  the  energy  source  that  powers  the  sun  and  stars.  Fusion
power  could  play  a  key  role  in  U.S.  long-term  energy  plans  and  independence  be-
cause  it  offers  the  potential  for  plentiful,  safe,  and  environmentally  benign  energy.
On  November  21,  2006,  the  DOE  signed  the  ITER  agreement  with  its  counterparts
in China, the European Union, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Russian
Federation,  formalizing  this  historic  arrangement  for  international  scientific  co-
operation.

The  U.S.  Contributions  to  ITER  project  is  being  managed  by  the  U.S.  ITER
Project  Office  (USIPO),  established  as  an  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  (ORNL)/
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) partnership. The FY 2008 request for
the  U.S.  Contributions  to  ITER  project  reflects  a  significant  increase  in  procure-
ment,  fabrication  activities,  and  delivery  of  medium-  and  high-technology  compo-
nents, assignment of U.S. personnel to the International ITER Organization abroad,
and the U.S. share of common costs at the ITER site in Cadarache, France, includ-
ing installation and testing. These costs are part of the Total Estimated Cost (TEC)
for  the  U.S.  Contributions  to  ITER  project.  There  is  a  second  category  of  costs,
Other  Project  Costs  (OPC),  which  is  for  the  supporting  research  and  development
activity for our U.S. Contributions. Together the TEC and OPC make up the overall
Total Project Cost which is $1,122,000,000.

In support of ITER and U.S. Contributions to ITER, FES has placed an increased
emphasis  on  its  national  burning  plasma  program—a  critical  underpinning  to  the
fusion  science  in  ITER.  FES  has  enhanced  burning  plasma  research  efforts  across
the  U.S.  domestic  fusion  program,  including:  carrying  out  experiments  on  our  na-
tional  FES  facilities  that  are  exploring  new  modes  of  improved  or  extended  ITER
performance  with  diagnostics  and  plasma  control  that  can  also  be  extrapolated  to
ITER;  developing  safe  and  environmentally  attractive  technologies  that  could  be
used  in  future  upgrades  of  ITER;  exploring  fusion  simulation  efforts  that  examine
the  complex  behavior  of  burning  plasmas  in  tokamaks;  and  integrating  all  that  is
learned  into  a  forward-looking  approach  to  future  fusion  applications.  The  U.S.
Burning Plasma Organization has been established to coordinate these efforts.

Section  972(c)(5)(C)  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  (EPAct)  of  2005,  required  the  Sec-
retary  of  Energy  to  provide  ‘‘a  report  describing  how  United  States  participation  in
the  ITER  will  be  funded  without  reducing  funding  for  other  programs  in  the  Office
of  Science  (including  other  fusion  programs). . ..’’  This  report  as  well  as  all  the
other requirements for FES in EPAct have been or are in the process of being com-
pleted. The Department’s FY 2008 budget provides for modest increases for all pro-
grams  within  the  Office  of  Science  and  supports  the  ITER  request  of  $160,000,000
from new funds in the FES budget request.

FES supports the operation of a set of experimental facilities. These facilities pro-
vide scientists with the means to test and extend our theoretical understanding and
computer  models—leading  ultimately  to  improved  predictive  capabilities  for  fusion

science.  Research  and  facility  operations  support  for  the  three  major  facilities  is
maintained  in  FY  2008.  Experimental  research  on  tokamaks  is  continued  with  em-
phasis  on  physics  issues  of  interest  to  the  ITER  project.  The  DIII–D  tokamak  at
General Atomics will operate for 15 weeks in FY 2008 to conduct research relevant
to burning plasma issues and topics of interest to the ITER project as well as main-
tain the broad scientific scope of the program. The Alcator C–Mod at the Massachu-
setts  Institute  of  Technology  will  operate  for  15  weeks  and  the  National  Spherical
Torus  Experiment  (NSTX)  at  the  Princeton  Plasma  Physics  Laboratory  (PPPL)  will
operate for 12 weeks. Fabrication of the major components of the National Compact
Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) at PPPL continues and assembly of the entire device
will be completed in FY 2009.

Funding  for  the  FES  SciDAC  program  continues  in  FY  2008  for  the  development
of  tools  that  facilitate  international  fusion  collaborations  and  initiate  development
of  an  integrated  software  environment  that  can  accommodate  the  wide  range  of
space and time scales and the multiple phenomena that are encountered in simula-
tions  of  fusion  systems.  Within  SciDAC,  the  Fusion  Simulation  Project  is  a  major
initiative  involving  plasma  physicists,  applied  mathematicians,  and  computer  sci-
entists  to  create  a  comprehensive  set  of  models  of  fusion  systems,  combined  with
the algorithms required to implement the models and the computational infrastruc-
ture to enable them to work together.

FES will issue a joint solicitation in FY 2008, with the National Nuclear Security
Administration  (NNSA),  focused  on  academic  research  in  high  energy  density  lab-
oratory  plasmas,  which  supports  the  Department’s  programmatic  goals  in  inertial
confinement fusion science.
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS AND SCIENTISTS
FY 2007 Request—$10.9 Million; FY 2008 Request—$11.0 Million

The  Department  of  Energy  has  played  a  role  in  training  America’s  scientists  and
engineers  for  more  than  50  years,  making  contributions  to  U.S.  economic  and  sci-
entific  preeminence.  The  Nation’s  current  and  future  energy  and  environmental
challenges may be solved in part through scientific and technological innovation and
a  highly  skilled  scientific  and  technical  workforce.  The  Workforce  Development  for
Teachers and Scientists (WDTS) program acts as a catalyst within the DOE for the
training  of  the  next  generation  of  scientists.  WDTS  programs  create  a  foundation
for DOE’s national laboratories to provide a wide range of educational opportunities
to  more  than  280,000  educators  and  students  on  an  annual  basis.  WDTS’s  mission
is to provide a continuum of educational opportunities to the Nation’s students and
teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

WDTS  supports  experiential  learning  opportunities  that  compliment  curriculum
taught  in  the  classroom  and  (1)  build  links  between  the  national  laboratories  and
the  science  education  community  by  providing  funding,  guidelines,  and  evaluation
of mentored research experiences at the national laboratories to K–12 teachers and
college faculty to enhance their content knowledge and research capabilities; (2) pro-
vide  mentor-intensive  research  experiences  at  the  national  laboratories  for  under-
graduate and graduate students to inspire commitments to the technical disciplines
and to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, thereby
helping our national laboratories and the Nation meet the demand for a well-trained
scientific/technical workforce; and (3) encourage and reward middle and high school
students  across  the  Nation  to  share,  demonstrate,  and  excel  in  math  and  the
sciences, and introduce these students to the national laboratories and the opportu-
nities available to them when they go to college.

In  FY  2008,  the  DOE  Academies  Creating  Teacher  Scientists  (DOE  ACTS)  pro-
gram,  formerly  the  Laboratory  Science  Teacher  Professional  Development  (LSTPD)
program,  will  support  the  participation  of  approximately  300  teachers.  All  17  of
DOE’s  national  laboratories  will  participate  in  this  program.  Each  national  labora-
tory  can  elect  to  implement  either  or  both  of  the  two  types  of  teacher  professional
development models in DOE ACTS: (1) Teachers as Investigators (TAI) is geared to-
wards novice teachers typically in the elementary to intermediate grade levels; and
(2) Teachers as Research Associates (TARA) for teachers with a stronger background
in science, mathematics, and engineering.

The  Science  Undergraduate  Laboratory  Internship  (SULI)  program,  which  pro-
vides mentor intensive research experiences for undergraduates at the national lab-
oratories, will support approximately 340 students in FY 2008. The Albert Einstein
Distinguished Educator Fellowships, the College Institute of Science and Technology
(CCI) program, the Pre-Service Teacher activity for students preparing for teaching
careers  in  a  STEM  discipline,  and  the  National  and  Middle  School  Science  Bowls
will all continue in FY 2008.

SCIENCE LABORATORIES INFRASTRUCTURE
FY 2007 Request—$50.9 Million; FY 2008 Request—$79.0 Million

The mission of the Science Laboratories Infrastructure (SLI) program is to enable
the conduct of DOE research missions at the Office of Science laboratories by fund-
ing  line  item  construction  projects  and  the  clean  up  for  reuse  or  removal  of  excess
facilities to maintain the general purpose infrastructure. The program also supports
Office of Science landlord responsibilities for the 24,000 acre Oak Ridge Reservation
and  provides  Payments  in  Lieu  of  Taxes  (PILT)  to  local  communities  around  ANL,
BNL, and ORNL.

In  FY  2008,  SLI  will  fund  four  construction  subprojects:  Seismic  Safety  Upgrade
of Buildings, Phase I, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL); Mod-
ernization  of  Building  4500N,  Wing  4,  Phase  I,  at  ORNL;  Building  Electrical  Serv-
ices Upgrade, Phase II, at ANL; and Renovate Science Laboratory, Phase I, at BNL.
Funding  for  FY  2008  includes  $35,000,000  held  in  reserve  pending  resolution  of
issues  related  to  capability  replacement  and  renovation  at  PNNL.  If  the  issues  are
resolved,  DOE  will  initiate  a  reprogramming  request  to  use  these  funds  to  replace
and/or  upgrade  mission-critical  facilities  currently  located  in  the  Hanford  Site  300
Area.  The  SLI  program  continues  funding  for  demolition  of  the  Bevatron  at  LBNL
in  FY  2008,  and  funding  is  also  provided  for  the  demolition  of  several  small  build-
ings and trailers at ORNL.
SCIENCE PROGRAM DIRECTION
FY 2007 Request—$170.9 Million; FY 2008 Request—$184.9 Million

Science  Program  Direction  (SCPD)  enables  a  skilled,  highly  motivated  federal
workforce to manage the Office of Science’s basic and applied research portfolio, pro-
grams,  projects,  and  facilities  in  support  of  new  and  improved  energy,  environ-
mental, and health technologies. SCPD consists of two subprograms: Program Direc-
tion and Field Operations.

The  Program  Direction  subprogram  is  the  single  funding  source  for  the  Office  of
Science  federal  staff  in  headquarters  responsible  for  managing,  directing,  admin-
istering,  and  supporting  the  broad  spectrum  of  Office  of  Science  disciplines.  This
subprogram  includes  planning  and  analysis  activities,  providing  the  capabilities
needed  to  plan,  evaluate,  and  communicate  the  scientific  excellence,  relevance,  and
performance of the Office of Science basic research programs. Additionally, Program
Direction  includes  funding  for  the  Office  of  Scientific  and  Technical  Information
(OSTI)  which  collects,  preserves,  and  disseminates  DOE  research  and  development
(R&D) information for use by DOE, the scientific community, academia, U.S. indus-
try,  and  the  public  to  expand  the  knowledge  base  of  science  and  technology.  The
Field  Operations  subprogram  is  the  funding  source  for  the  federal  workforce  in  the
Field  responsible  for  management  and  administrative  functions  performed  within
the Chicago and Oak Ridge Operations Offices, and site offices supporting the Office
of Science laboratories and facilities.

In FY 2008, Program Direction funding increases by 8.2 percent from the FY 2007
request.  Most  of  the  increase  will  support  an  additional  29  FTEs,  to  mange  the  in-
crease  in  the  SC  research  investment  that  is  a  key  component  of  the  President’s
American Competitiveness Initiative; four new FTEs to support NSLS–II, and ITER
project office activities; and 35 FTEs—the staff of the New Brunswick Laboratory—
transferring from the Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance. Twenty-
four  FTEs  are  reduced  across  the  SC  complex  in  FY  2008  consistent  with  SC’s  cor-
porate workforce planning strategy. The SCPD FY 2008 increase also supports a 2.2
percent  pay  raise;  an  increased  cap  for  SES  basic  pay;  other  pay  related  costs  such
as  the  government’s  contributions  for  employee  health  insurance  and  Federal  Em-
ployees’ Retirement System (FERS); escalation of non-pay categories, such as travel,
training,  and  contracts;  and  increased  e-Gov  assessments  and  other  fixed  operating
requirements across the Office of Science complex.
SAFEGUARDS AND SECURITY
FY 2007 Request—$71.0 Million; FY 2008 Request—$71.0 Million

The Safeguards and Security (S&S) program ensures appropriate levels of protec-
tion  against  unauthorized  access,  theft,  diversion,  loss  of  custody,  or  destruction  of
DOE  assets  and  hostile  acts  that  may  cause  adverse  impacts  on  fundamental
science,  national  security,  or  the  health  and  safety  of  DOE  and  contractor  employ-
ees,  the  public,  or  the  environment.  The  Office  of  Science’s  Integrated  Safeguards
and Security Management strategy uses a tailored approach to safeguards and secu-
rity.  As  such,  each  site  has  a  specific  protection  program  that  is  analyzed  and  de-
fined in its individual Security Plan. This approach allows each site to design vary-

ing  degrees  of  protection  commensurate  with  the  risks  and  consequences  described
in  their  site-specific  threat  scenarios.  The  FY  2008  budget  includes  funding  nec-
essary to protect people and property at the 2003 Design Basis Threat (DBT) level.
In FY 2008, funding for the Cyber Security program element addresses the promul-
gation  of  new  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  requirements
that  are  statutorily  required  by  the  Federal  Information  Security  Management  Act
(FISMA) to improve the Federal and Office of Science laboratory cyber security pos-
ture.
CONCLUSION

I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for providing this opportunity to discuss the
Office  of  Science  research  programs  and  our  contributions  to  the  Nation’s  scientific
enterprise and U.S. competitiveness. On behalf of DOE, I am pleased to present this
FY 2008 budget request for the Office of Science.

This  concludes  my  testimony.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any  questions  you

might have.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  DENNIS  R.  SPURGEON,  ASSISTANT  SEC-
RETARY  FOR  NUCLEAR  ENERGY,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF  EN-
ERGY
Mr.  SPURGEON.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Mem-
ber  Inglis,  Chairman  Gordon,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.
It  is  a  pleasure  to  be  here  to  discuss  the  fiscal  year  2008  budget
request  for  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Nuclear  Energy.
The  Office  of  Nuclear  Energy  has  made  a  great  deal  of  progress
in  the  last  several  years  in  advancing  our  nation’s  energy  security
and independence, in support of the Department’s strategic plan. It
is my near-term highest priority to enable industry to deploy a new
generation  of  nuclear  power  plants.  We  have  also  made  steps  for-
ward  in  developing  advanced  nuclear  reactor  and  fuel  cycle  tech-
nologies  while  maintaining  a  critical  national  nuclear  infrastruc-
ture.

Today,  103  nuclear  reactors  generate  roughly  20  percent  of
America’s electricity. U.S. electricity demand is anticipated to grow
by  50  percent  over  the  next  25  years,  the  equivalent  of  45  to  50
one-thousand  megawatt  nuclear  reactors  must  be  built  just  to
maintain  that  20  percent  share.  The  U.S.  is  at  a  critical  juncture
in  the  future  of  nuclear  power  in  the  United  States.  Unlike  many
of our international research partners, our nuclear industry has not
been  heavily  supported  financially  or  politically  over  the  past  30
years.  Today,  the  need  for  increased  electric  generating  capacity  is
clear, and hopefully undisputed. Fortunately, we do have a growth
option that allows us to have a diversified electric generation port-
folio  that  includes  a  significant  carbon  emissions  free  component,
and that is nuclear power.

To support near-term domestic expansion of the nuclear industry,
the  fiscal  year  2008  budget  requests  $114  million  for  the  Nuclear
Power  2010  program  to  support  continued  cost-share  efforts  with
industry to reduce the barriers to deployment of new nuclear power
plants  in  the  United  States.  We  anticipate  the  NRC  will  soon
vote—actually, I think it is tomorrow—on approval of the early site
permit for the Exelon Generation Company’s Clinton site in central
Illinois,  which  represents  a  major  accomplishment  in  the  Energy
Department’s  efforts  to  address  the  barriers  and  stimulate  deploy-
ment of new nuclear power plants in the United States.

With  nuclear  power  as  the  only  proven  base  load  producer  of
electricity  that  does  not  emit  greenhouse  gases,  it  is  vital  that  our

current fleet of reactors be expanded in order to meet our needs for
carbon-free, dependable, and economic electric power.

Any serious effort toward expanding global use of nuclear energy
will  inevitably  require  us  to  address  the  spent  fuel  and  prolifera-
tion  challenges  that  accompany  such  an  expansion.  To  meet  these
challenges,  President  Bush  initiated  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy
Partnership, or GNEP, a comprehensive approach to enable an ex-
pansion  of  nuclear  power  in  the  United  States  and  around  the
world,  to  promote  nonproliferation  goals,  and  to  help  resolve  the
nuclear waste issues.

Domestically,  GNEP  provides  a  solution  to  the  ever-growing
issue  of  spent  nuclear  fuel.  In  conjunction  with  Yucca  Mountain,
GNEP provides a solution which outlines a closed fuel cycle, where
energy  is  harvested  from  the  spent  fuel  before  the  end  product  is
disposed of in a permanent repository. The spent fuel will be recy-
cled in a manner that will be more proliferation-resistant than cur-
rent  processes  used  around  the  world.  A  closed  fuel  cycle  will  also
alleviate  some  of  the  burden  placed  on  Yucca  Mountain,  and  will
possibly  eliminate  the  need  for  a  second  geologic  repository
throughout  the  remainder  of  this  century.  We  reiterate,  though,
that no fuel cycle scenario will eliminate the need for a permanent
geologic repository such as Yucca Mountain.

Internationally,  GNEP  promises  to  address  the  growing  global
energy  demand  in  an  environmentally  friendly  way.  A  global  re-
gime  of  countries  able  to  provide  a  complete  portfolio  of  nuclear
fuel services, including Russia, France, and possibly Japan, China,
and Britain, will provide these services to countries wanting to use
nuclear  power  to  meet  their  domestic  growth  and  electricity  de-
mand  without  the  cost  and  risk  associated  with  nuclear  fuel  cycle
infrastructure.  By  providing  these  services  to  other  countries,  we
hope  to  dissuade  future  states  from  developing  domestic  enrich-
ment capabilities like we are encountering with Iran today.

The  fact  is  the  U.S.  is  not  currently  positioned  to  be  an  active
member  of  this  global  regime.  We  have  limited  enrichment  capa-
bilities and no back-end fuel cycle capabilities. Creating capabilities
needed to provide—to participate in the global expansion of nuclear
power  will  take  15  to  20  years,  meaning  that  in  order  to  become
an  active  participant  of  the  global  nuclear  expansion,  we  need  to
begin  now.  Taking  those  steps  necessary  enables  us  to  better  as-
sure  that  the  imminent  expansion  will  be  safe,  beneficial,  and  will
not  promote  the  proliferation  of  nuclear  weapons.  If  we  fail  to  act,
we will have little to say in the process.

The  Department  requests  $405  million  in  fiscal  year  2008  to
begin  work  on  developing  a  detailed  roadmap  for  implementing  all
aspects of the GNEP vision.

Mr.  Chairman,  we  appreciate  the  support  that  we  have  received
from  the  Committee  as  we  seek  to  address  the  challenges  sur-
rounding  the  global  expansion  of  nuclear  power.  We  remain  con-
fident  and  optimistic  about  the  role  of  nuclear  energy  in  providing
a solution to our nation’s energy stability and independence.

I would be pleased to answer your questions. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DENNIS R. SPURGEON

Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  it
is a pleasure to be here to discuss the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 budget request for The
Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy.

The  Department  of  Energy’s  strategic  plan  portrays  a  long-term  vision  of  a  zero-
emission  future,  free  from  the  reliance  on  imported  energy.  A  portfolio  of  nuclear
programs  is  provided  for  in  this  plan  for  near-term,  medium-term,  and  long-term
sustained advances in nuclear technology.

The Office of Nuclear Energy has made a great deal of progress in the last several
years in advancing our nation’s energy security and independence in support of the
Department’s strategic plan. The Department remains committed to enabling indus-
try  to  deploy  a  new  generation  of  nuclear  power  plants.  We  have  also  made  steps
forward  in  developing  advanced  nuclear  reactor  and  fuel  cycle  technologies  while
maintaining a critical national nuclear infrastructure.

Today,  103  nuclear  reactors  generate  roughly  20  percent  of  America’s  electricity.
U.S.  electricity  demand  is  anticipated  to  grow  50  percent  over  the  next  25  years—
the  equivalent  of  45  to  50  one-thousand  megawatt  nuclear  reactors  must  be  built
to maintain that 20 percent share. With nuclear power as the only proven base load
producer  of  electricity  that  does  not  emit  greenhouse  gases,  it  is  vital  that  our  cur-
rent  fleet  of  reactors  be  expanded  in  order  to  meet  our  needs  for  carbon-free,  de-
pendable and economic electric power.

Any  serious  effort  to  stabilize  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere,  while  pro-
viding  the  increasing  amounts  of  energy  needed  for  economic  development  and
growth,  requires  the  expanded  use  of  nuclear  energy.  This  will  inevitably  require
us to address the spent fuel and proliferation challenges that confront the expanded,
global use of nuclear energy. To meet these challenges, the Department initiated the
Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), a comprehensive approach to enable an
expansion of nuclear power in the U.S. and around the world, promote non-prolifera-
tion goals, and help minimize the amount of nuclear waste disposal.

GNEP  is  a  perfect  example  of  where  global  cooperation  is  required  to  address  a
changing  global  energy  landscape.  The  United  States  has  a  unique  opportunity  to
influence  global  energy  policy,  and  more  specifically  global  nuclear  energy  policy.
However, for the U.S. to have influence abroad, we must have an established domes-
tic policy supportive of a significant role for nuclear power in our energy future, an
aggressive  nuclear  research  and  development  program,  and  a  viable  nuclear  tech-
nology infrastructure. Through the GNEP program, we are pursuing in parallel the
development  of  the  policies,  technologies,  and  facilities  necessary  for  the  U.S.  to  be
a  global  leader  in  the  nuclear  energy  enterprise  and  to  ensure  our  energy  security
and national security objectives.

The Department’s FY 2008 budget request proposes an $874.6 million investment
in  nuclear  research,  development  and  infrastructure  for  the  Nation’s  future.  This
budget request supports the President’s priorities to enhance the Nation’s energy se-
curity  while  enabling  significant  improvements  in  environmental  quality.  Our  re-
quest  supports  development  of  new  nuclear  generation  technologies  and  advanced
energy  products  that  provide  significant  improvements  in  sustainability,  economics,
safety and reliability, and proliferation and terrorism resistance.

While  we  have  made  great  progress  in  all  program  areas,  much  remains  to  be
done.  Our  FY  2008  request  moves  us  in  the  right  direction  and  I  will  now  provide
you a full report of our activities and explain the President’s request for nuclear en-
ergy in detail.
NUCLEAR POWER 2010

To  support  near-term  domestic  expansion  of  nuclear  energy,  the  FY  2008  budget
requests  $114  million  for  the  Nuclear  Power  2010  program  to  support  continued
cost-shared  efforts  with  industry  to  reduce  the  barriers  to  the  deployment  of  new
nuclear  power  plants  in  the  U.S.  The  technology  focus  of  the  Nuclear  Power  2010
program is on Generation III+ advanced, light water reactor designs, which offer ad-
vancements in safety and economics over the Generation III designs certified in the
1990s  by  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC).  To  reduce  the  regulatory  un-
certainties and enable the deployment of new Generation III+ nuclear power plants
in  the  U.S.,  it  is  essential  to  demonstrate  the  untested  federal  regulatory  processes
for the siting, construction, and operation of new nuclear plants. In addition, design
finalization of two standard plant designs and NRC certification of these Generation
III+  advanced  reactor  concepts  are  needed  to  reduce  the  high  initial  capital  costs
of the first new plants so that these new technologies can be competitive in the de-
regulated electricity market and deployable within the next decade.

The  FY  2008  budget  request  continues  the  licensing  demonstration  activities
started in previous years. Activities include completion of the last Early Site Permit
demonstration  projects  and  continuation  of  the  New  Nuclear  Plant  Licensing  Dem-
onstration projects that will exercise the untested licensing process to build and op-
erate  new  nuclear  plants  and  complete  and  obtain  certification  of  two  advanced
Generation  III+  advanced  reactor  designs.  Engineering  activities  in  support  of  the
submission of two combined Construction and Operating License (COL) applications
to  the  NRC  will  continue.  In  addition,  two  reactor  vendors  will  continue  first-of-a-
kind design activities for two standard nuclear plants.

We  anticipate  the  NRC  will  soon  vote  on  approval  of  the  Early  Site  Permit  for
the  Exelon  Generation  Company’s  Clinton  site  in  central  Illinois,  which  culminates
a  four-year,  cost-shared  project  between  DOE  and  the  Chicago-based  Exelon  Cor-
poration.  NRC  approval  of  the  Clinton  Early  Site  Permit  would  represent  a  major
accomplishment in the Energy Department’s effort to address the barriers and stim-
ulate deployment of new nuclear power plants in the United States.

The  project  teams,  Dominion  Energy  and  NuStart  Energy  Development  LLC,  in-
volved  in  the  licensing  demonstration  projects  represent  power  generating  compa-
nies  and  reactor  vendors  that  operate  more  than  two-thirds  of  all  the  U.S.  nuclear
power  plants  in  operation  today.  As  a  result  of  the  Nuclear  Power  2010  program
and  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  financial  incentives  (e.g.,  standby  support),  fourteen
power  companies  have  announced  their  intentions  to  apply  for  combined  construc-
tion  and  operating  licenses.  Several  have  specifically  stated  that  they  are  building
on work being done in the Nuclear Power 2010 program as the basis for their appli-
cations.

The  U.S.  is  at  a  critical  juncture  in  the  future  of  nuclear  power  in  the  United
States.  Unlike  many  of  our  international  research  partners,  our  nuclear  industry
has not been heavily supported financially and politically over the past thirty years.
Today  the  need  for  increased  electrical  generating  capacity  is  clear  and  hopefully
undisputed.  We  have  only  one  growth  option  that  allows  us  to  have  a  diversified
electrical generation portfolio that includes a significant carbon emissions-free com-
ponent, and that is nuclear power. To realize this option, we are asking private com-
panies  to  build  plants  whose  collective  cost  will  likely  exceed  their  net  worth.  This
represents an enormous financial risk, the same risk that caused many U.S. compa-
nies to go into bankruptcy in the past.

If  one  accepts  the  fact  that  we  need  more  electrical  generation  capacity,  and  if
one  desires  to  have  a  component  of  that  new  capacity  that  is  carbon  free,  and  one
recognizes  the  financial  considerations  associated  with  such  a  large  private  invest-
ment  in  technologies  that  we  have  not  supported  in  thirty  years,  then  the  impor-
tance of this program to our future energy security is self-evident. These companies
will  be  building  new  generating  capacity  in  the  very  near  future,  but  the  question
they  must  first  answer  is  whether  this  generation  will  come  from  clean,  safe,  nu-
clear technologies or not.

If widely deployed in the U.S., these new technologies will create significant busi-
ness  opportunities  and  will  support  the  rapid  growth  of  heavy  equipment  fabrica-
tion, high technology and commercial construction industries in this country. More-
over, these American technologies and industrial capabilities will be highly competi-
tive  internationally  and  would  support  our  leadership  role  in  the  global  expansion
of safe, clean nuclear power.
ADVANCED FUEL CYCLE INITIATIVE

One  of  the  most  important  and  challenging  issues  affecting  future  expansion  of
nuclear  energy  in  the  U.S.  and  worldwide  is  dealing  effectively  with  spent  nuclear
fuel and high-level waste. For the medium-term, the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative
(AFCI)  will  develop  fuel  cycle  technologies  that  will  support  the  economic  and  sus-
tained production of nuclear energy while minimizing waste in a proliferation-resist-
ant manner. To support the development of these technologies, the FY 2008 Budget
request includes $395.0 million for AFCI.

AFCI’s  near-term  goals  are  to  develop  and  demonstrate  advanced,  proliferation-
resistant  fuel  cycle  technologies  for  treatment  of  commercial  light  water  reactor
spent  fuel,  to  develop  an  integrated  spent  fuel  recycling  plan,  and  to  provide  infor-
mation  and  support  on  efforts  to  minimize  the  amount  of  material  that  needs  dis-
posal in a geologic repository. AFCI conducts research and development of spent fuel
treatment and recycling technologies to support an expanding role for nuclear power
in  the  U.S.  and  to  promote  world-wide  expansion  of  nuclear  energy  in  a  prolifera-
tion-resistant  manner  as  envisioned  for  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership
(GNEP). AFCI is the U.S. technology component of the GNEP.

Specifically, in FY 2008, the Department intends to complete industry-led concep-
tual design studies for the nuclear fuel recycling center and the advanced recycling

reactor  Demonstration  Analysis.  Additionally,  DOE  will  continue  start-to-finish
demonstrations  of  recycling  technologies,  which  are  expected  to  produce  separated
transuranics for use in transmutation fuel development, as well as conduct systems
analysis  and  advanced  computing  and  simulation  activities  focused  on  a  variety  of
deployment  system  alternatives  and  supporting  technology  development.  As  part  of
GNEP  Technology  Development,  the  Department  also  intends  to  evaluate  small,
proliferation-resistant reactors for potential U.S. manufacture and export to reactor
user nations.

GNEP  seeks  to  bring  about  a  significant,  wide-scale  use  of  nuclear  energy,  and
to  take  actions  now  that  will  allow  that  vision  to  be  achieved  while  decreasing  the
risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and effectively addressing the challenges of nu-
clear waste disposal. GNEP will advance the nonproliferation and national security
interests  of  the  United  States  by  reinforcing  its  nonproliferation  policies  and  lim-
iting  the  spread  of  enrichment  and  reprocessing  technologies,  and  will  eventually
eliminate excess civilian plutonium stocks that have accumulated. The AFCI budget
request  supports  the  Department’s  goal  of  realizing  the  GNEP  vision.  AFCI  activi-
ties  in  FY  2007  and  FY  2008  are  focused  on  developing  a  detailed  roadmap  for  im-
plementing  all  aspects  of  the  GNEP  vision  and  informing  a  Secretarial  decision  in
June 2008 on the path forward for GNEP.

Long-term  goals  for  AFCI/GNEP  will  develop  and  demonstrate  an  advanced,  pro-
liferation-resistant closed nuclear fuel cycle system involving spent fuel partitioning
and  recycling  of  actinides  and  other  long-lived  radioactive  elements  for  destruction
through transmutation in fast reactors that could result in a significant increase in
the  effective  capacity  of  the  planned  Yucca  Mountain  repository.  This  increase
would come principally from the destruction of actinides that generate the heat that
limits  repository  capacity  that  the  Yucca  Mountain  repository  would  have.  This  ca-
pacity  increase  would  ensure  enough  capacity  to  accommodate  all  the  spent  fuel
generated in the United States this century from any reasonably conceivable deploy-
ment  scenario  for  nuclear  energy.  Yet,  under  any  fuel  cycle  scenario  a  geologic  re-
pository is necessary. Therefore, GNEP and Yucca Mountain are proceeding on par-
allel tracks.
GENERATION IV NUCLEAR ENERGY SYSTEMS INITIATIVE

The  FY  2008  budget  request  includes  $36.1  million  to  continue  development  of
next-generation nuclear energy systems within the Generation IV program. For the
long-term, the Generation IV program will develop new nuclear energy systems that
can  compete  with  advanced  fossil  and  renewable  technologies,  enabling  power  pro-
viders  to  select  from  a  diverse  group  of  options  that  are  economical,  reliable,  safe,
secure, and environmentally acceptable. In particular, the Next Generation Nuclear
Plant (NGNP) reactor concept will be capable of providing high-temperature process
heat for various industrial applications, including the production of hydrogen in sup-
port of the President’s Advanced Energy Initiative.

The  NGNP,  with  an  investment  of  $30  million  within  the  Generation  IV  Nuclear
Energy Systems Initiative, will utilize a Generation IV Very High Temperature Re-
actor  configured  for  production  of  high  temperature  process  heat  for  the  generation
of  hydrogen,  electricity,  and  other  industrial  commodities.  The  Energy  Policy  Act  of
2005  (EPACT)  authorized  the  Department  to  create  a  two-phased  NGNP  Project  at
the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  (INL).  The  Department  is  presently  engaged  in
Phase 1 of the EPACT defined scope of work which includes: developing a licensing
strategy,  selecting  and  validating  the  appropriate  hydrogen  production  technology,
conducting  enabling  research  and  development  for  the  reactor  system,  determining
whether it is appropriate to combine electricity generation and hydrogen production
in a single prototype nuclear reactor and plant, and establishing key design param-
eters. Phase I will continue until 2011, at which time the Department will evaluate
the  need  for  continuing  into  the  design  and  construction  activities  called  for  in
Phase II.

The  FY  2008  budget  request  maintains  critical  R&D  that  will  help  achieve  the
desired  goals  of  sustainability,  economics,  and  proliferation  resistance.  Further  in-
vestigation of technical and economical challenges and risks is needed before a deci-
sion can be made to proceed with a demonstration of a next-generation reactor.
NUCLEAR HYDROGEN INITIATIVE

Hydrogen offers significant promise as a future energy technology, particularly for
the transportation sector. The use of hydrogen in transportation will reduce U.S. de-
pendence  on  foreign  sources  of  petroleum,  enhancing  our  energy  security.  The  FY
2008 budget request for the Office of Nuclear Energy includes $22.6 million to con-
tinue to develop enabling technologies, demonstrate nuclear-based hydrogen produc-

39

tion technologies, and study potential hydrogen production strategies to support the
President’s vision for a future hydrogen economy.

Currently,  the  only  economical,  large-scale  method  of  hydrogen  production  in-
volves the conversion of methane into hydrogen through a steam reforming process.
This  process  produces  ten  kilograms  of  greenhouse  gases  for  every  kilogram  of  hy-
drogen,  defeating  a  primary  advantage  of  using  hydrogen—its  environmental  bene-
fits.  Another  existing  method,  electrolysis,  converts  water  into  hydrogen  using  elec-
tricity.  Electrolysis  is  typically  used  for  small  production  quantities  and  is  inher-
ently  less  efficient  because  electricity  must  first  be  produced  to  run  the  equipment
used  to  convert  the  water  into  hydrogen.  Additionally,  the  environmental  benefits
of  electrolysis  are  negated  unless  a  non-emitting  technology,  such  as  nuclear  or  re-
newable energy, is used to produce the electricity. The Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative
is  developing  processes  that  operate  across  a  range  of  temperatures  for  the  various
advanced  reactors  being  researched  by  the  Generation  IV  Nuclear  Energy  Systems
Initiative. These processes, coupled with advanced nuclear reactors, have the poten-
tial for high-efficiency, large-scale production of hydrogen.

The  objective  of  this  program  is  to  demonstrate  the  technologies  at  increasingly
larger scales ultimately culminating in an industrial scale that would be technically
and economically suited for commercial deployment. FY 2005 and FY 2006 activities
were focused on the validation of individual processes and components; FY 2007 and
FY 2008 are focused on the design, construction and operation of integrated labora-
tory  scale  experiments.  In  FY  2008,  the  Department  will  complete  construction  of
integrated laboratory-scale system experiments and begin testing to enable the 2011
selection of the technology that could be demonstrated in a pilot scale hydrogen pro-
duction experiment.
RADIOLOGICAL FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

The Office of Nuclear Energy’s FY 2008 budget request also includes $53.0 million
to maintain critical research and production facilities for medical isotopes and radio-
isotope  power  systems  at  the  Idaho  National  Laboratory,  the  Oak  Ridge  National
Laboratory,  the  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory,  the  Sandia  National  Laboratory,
and  the  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory.  This  request  also  includes  funding  for
University Research Reactors.

These  funds  assure  that  the  infrastructure  for  the  facilities  meet  essential  safety
and  environmental  requirements  and  are  maintained  at  operable  user-ready  levels.
Programmatic  activities,  including  production  and  research,  are  funded  either  by
other DOE programs, by the private sector, or by other federal agency users.

The  Department  seeks  $14.9  million  to  maintain  one-of-a-kind  facilities  at  the
Idaho,  Oak  Ridge,  Brookhaven,  and  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratories  for  isotope
production  and  processing.  These  isotopes  are  used  to  help  improve  the  accuracy,
effectiveness, and continuation of medical diagnoses and therapy, enhance homeland
security, improve the efficiency of industrial processes, and provide precise measure-
ment  and  investigative  tools  for  materials,  biomedical,  environmental,  archae-
ological, and other research. Actual operations, production, research or other activi-
ties  are  funded  either  by  other  DOE  programs,  by  the  private  sector,  or  by  other
federal agency users.

The  Department  also  maintains  unique  facilities  and  capabilities  at  the  Idaho,
Oak  Ridge,  and  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratories  that  enable  the  Department  to
provide  the  radioisotope  power  systems  for  space  exploration  and  national  security
applications. The FY 2008 budget requests $35.1 million to maintain the basic facili-
ties  and  associated  personnel  whereas  mission  specific  development  or  hardware
fabrication  costs  are  provided  by  the  user  agencies.  This  arrangement  is  essential
in  order  to  preserve  the  basic  capability  regardless  of  periodic  fluctuations  in  the
demand of the end product users.

Finally,  the  Department  requests  $2.9  million  in  FY  2008  to  provide  research  re-
actor  fuel  to  universities  and  dispose  of  spent  fuel  from  university  reactors.  Cur-
rently,  there  are  27  operating  university  research  reactors  at  27  institutions  in  the
U.S. Many of these facilities have permanent fuel cores and therefore do not require
regular  fuel  shipments.  However,  DOE  supplies  approximately  a  dozen  universities
with fresh fuel and shipments of spent fuel as needed.
IDAHO FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

The  Department  is  working  to  transform  Idaho  National  Laboratory  into  one  of
the world’s foremost nuclear research laboratories. As such, the FY 2008 budget re-
quest  seeks  $104.7  million  for  the  Idaho  Facilities  Management  Program  to  main-
tain and enhance the laboratory’s nuclear energy research infrastructure.

The  Idaho  Facilities  Management  Program  operates  and  maintains  three  main
engineering and research campuses and the Central Facilities Area at the Idaho Na-

tional  Laboratory.  The  three  main  engineering  and  research  campuses  are:  (1)  the
Reactor  Technology  Complex  which  houses  the  world-renown  Advanced  Test  Reac-
tor, (2) the Materials and Fuels Complex, and (3) the Science and Technology Cam-
pus.  As  the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  landlord,  the  Office  of  Nuclear  Energy  also
operates  and  maintains  the  Central  Facilities  Area  at  Idaho  National  Laboratory,
providing site-wide support services and from which various site infrastructure sys-
tems  and  facilities,  such  as  electrical  utility  distribution,  intra-laboratory  commu-
nications systems, and roads are managed and maintained. Also included within the
Central  Facilities  Area  is  the  Radiological  and  Environmental  Sciences  Laboratory
operated by the Office of Nuclear Energy.
IDAHO SITE-WIDE SAFEGUARDS & SECURITIES

The mission of the Idaho Site-wide Safeguards and Security program is to protect
the assets and infrastructure of the Idaho National Laboratory from theft, diversion,
sabotage,  espionage,  unauthorized  access,  compromise,  and  other  hostile  acts  that
may  cause  unacceptable  adverse  impacts  on  national  security;  program  continuity;
or the health and safety of employees, the public, or the environment.

The  FY  2008  Budget  Request  includes  $72.9  million  to  provide  protection  of  nu-
clear materials, classified matter, Government property, and other vital assets from
unauthorized  access,  theft  ,  diversion,  sabotage,  espionage,  and  other  hostile  acts
that  may  cause  risks  to  national  security,  the  health  and  safety  of  DOE  and  con-
tractor employees, the public or the environment.
UNIVERSITY REACTOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND EDUCATIONAL ASSIST-

ANCE

While the University Educational Assistance program has concluded, funding will
continue to be provided to the Nation’s nuclear science and engineering universities
through  our  applied  research  and  development  programs  by  means  of  our  Nuclear
Energy  Research  Initiative  (NERI).  NERI  funds  are  competitively  awarded  to  sup-
port  research  objectives  of  the  Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative,  the  Generation  IV
Energy  Systems  Initiative  and  the  Nuclear  Hydrogen  Initiative.  By  increasing  the
opportunities for university participation in our research programs, the Department
seeks to establish an improved education and research network among universities,
laboratories,  industry  and  government.  Approximately  $62  million  in  funding  for
universities is included in the research programs for FY 2008, a 21 percent increase
over the FY 2007 request.
CONCLUSION

This  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  Your  leadership  and  guidance  has  been
essential  to  the  progress  the  program  has  achieved  thus  far  and  your  support  is
needed as we engage the task ahead of investing in our energy security.

I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR DENNIS R. SPURGEON

Dennis  Spurgeon  was  sworn  in  on  April  3,  2006,  as  the  first  Assistant  Secretary
for  Nuclear  Energy  (NE)  at  the  Department  of  Energy  in  more  than  a  decade.  In
this capacity, Mr. Spurgeon is the senior nuclear technology official in the U.S. Gov-
ernment.

Mr.  Spurgeon  is  responsible  for  the  Department’s  nuclear  energy  enterprise,  in-
cluding  nuclear  technology  research  and  development,  management  of  the  Depart-
ment’s  nuclear  technology  infrastructure,  and  support  to  nuclear  education  in  the
United States. NE’s nuclear technology infrastructure is comprised of hot cells, test
reactors, accelerators and other highly specialized facilities that support nuclear re-
search  and  development,  materials  testing,  and  production  of  isotopes  for  medicine
and radioisotope power systems for space and national security users. He is respon-
sible for execution of a $536 million annual federal budget (FY 2006).

Mr.  Spurgeon  leads  the  recently-announced  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership,
a  comprehensive  strategy  aimed  at  accelerating  the  demonstration  of  a  more  pro-
liferation  resistant  closed  fuel  cycle  and  bringing  the  benefits  of  nuclear  energy  to
the  world  in  a  safer  and  more  secure  manner,  reducing  the  possibility  that  nuclear
energy could be used for non-peaceful purposes. GNEP is part of the President’s Ad-
vanced Energy Initiative.

Most  recently,  Assistant  Secretary  Spurgeon  served  as  Executive  Vice  President
and Chief Operating Office for USEC, Inc. an international supplier of enriched ura-
nium for nuclear plants. Prior to that, he served as Chairman, Chief Executive Offi-
cer  and  principal  owner  of  Swiftships,  an  international  leader  in  shipbuilding  for
commercial and military markets.

Assistant Secretary Spurgeon held posts in the Ford administration, including an
assignment  as  Assistant  Director  for  Fuel  Cycle  in  the  U.S.  Energy  Research  and
Development Administration. He was a member of the White House task force that
developed President Ford’s nuclear policy. Earlier in his career, as a U.S. Naval offi-
cer,  he  served  as  technical  assistant  to  Commissioner  Tommy  Thompson  and  later
to Dr. Glenn Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and predecessor
agency of the department.

He also held executive positions at the former United Nuclear Corporation, where
as  Chief  Operating  Officer  he  managed  the  manufacturing  of  reactor  cores  for  the

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ALEXANDER  KARSNER,  ASSISTANT  SEC-
RETARY  FOR  ENERGY  EFFICIENCY  AND  RENEWABLE  EN-
ERGY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Mr.  KARSNER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Chairman,  Rank-
ing  Member  Inglis,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for
the opportunity to testify on the President’s fiscal year 2008 budget
request  for  the  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy.
The  request  includes  $1.24  billion  for  EERE,  approximately  $60
million  more  than  the  fiscal  year  2007  request  to  Congress.  To  be
clear,  my  testimony  today  on  the  fiscal  year  2008  budget  request
is presented in comparison to the Administration’s fiscal year 2007
request,  not  the  final  amounts  that  were  eventually  appropriated
in  the  2007  Continuing  Resolution.  The  Department  of  Energy  is
in the process of preparing an operating plan for submittal to Con-
gress, as required. EERE received an increase in funding under the
CR, as you know, and I am grateful to Congress for its strong com-
mitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

The budget request addresses pressing energy security, economic,
and  environmental  challenges  facing  our  country  today.  Accel-
erating the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency
technologies will maximize rational utilization of our resources and
clean energy production. Much of EERE’s funding is integral to the
President’s  Advanced  Energy  Initiative.  The  AEI,  launched  in
2006,  aims  to  confront  our  addiction  to  oil,  reducing  our  depend-
ence  on  foreign  sources  of  energy,  and  commercializing  emission-
free  sources  of  power  generation.  The  technology  investment  is
meant  to  change  the  way  we  power  our  homes,  offices,  and  vehi-
cles.

In his 2007 State of the Union address, the President raised the
bar further by challenging our country to reduce gasoline consump-
tion  by  20  percent  within  the  decade,  and  advocated  the  ‘‘Twenty
in  Ten’’  plan.  The  budget  request  increases  funding  for  programs
to  help  the  Nation  achieve  the  Twenty  in  Ten  goal,  including  for
example, biomass and biofuels R&D, and expanding the availability
of alternative transportation fuels.

We  must  work  to  not  only  accelerate  R&D  for  new  energy  tech-
nologies, but speed the adoption of the technologies into commercial
products  that  can  become  more  widely  available  into  the  market-

place at a reasonable cost to all Americans. EERE is taking aggres-
sive  steps  to  catalyze  the  rapid  commercialization  and  deployment
of  critical  energy  advances  through  innovative  partnerships  with
lenders  and  investment  groups,  with  our  state  partners,  and  with
industrial leaders. EERE’s overall budget request reflects the fund-
ing needed to meet these goals.

The  fiscal  year  2008  request  for  Biomass  and  Biorefinery  Sys-
tems R&D is $179.3 million, an increase of approximately $30 mil-
lion. Biomass is the most viable renewable option for producing liq-
uid  transportation  fuels  in  the  near-term,  holding  great  potential
to help reduce our dependence on imported oil. EERE will continue
to  support  cost-share  efforts  with  industry  to  develop  and  dem-
onstrate  technologies  to  enable  cellulosic  biorefineries.  The  pro-
posed  increase  will  also  support  cost-share  projects  with  industry
for  enzyme  development  to  produce  low  cost  sugars  from  biomass,
and  for  improved  organism  development,  or  ethanologens,  for  con-
verting those sugars into ethanol.

For  the  Vehicle  Technologies  Program,  the  Department  is  re-
questing $176.1 million to advance development of increasingly en-
ergy-efficient  and  environmentally  friendly  flexible  platform  tech-
nologies  for  our  cars  and  trucks.  The  program  focuses  on  tech-
nologies that use significantly less oil, and enable the auto industry
to comply with reformed and modernized CAFE standards. Battery
technologies  have  made  significant  progress  towards  our  program
goals,  having  reduced  the  cost  of  next  generation  hybrid  vehicle
batteries in each of the past three years from almost $1,200 per ve-
hicle at the beginning of fiscal year 2004 to $750 per vehicle at the
end of fiscal year 2006. We expect to bring that down the cost curve
further  in  the  next  fiscal  year  to  $625  per  vehicle,  and  to  increase
our emphasis on batteries specifically optimized for plug-in hybrids.
EERE  seeks  to  have  battery  technology  ready  no  later  than  2014
that  will  enable  auto  manufacturers  to  widely  and  economically
produce  competitive  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles  having  a  40  mile  all
electric range.

Hydrogen  is  also  an  important  element  of  the  Nation’s  strategy
for energy security and environmental stewardship. The President’s
$309 million budget request for DOE and the Hydrogen Fuel Initia-
tive fulfills his commitment of $1.2 billion over five years. The por-
tion  that  is  under  my  purview  is  $213  million,  which  reflects  a
$17.2 million increase over the Fiscal 2007 budget request.

The  proposed  increase  will  accelerate  and  expand  the  efforts  to
research  and  develop  hydrogen  storage  systems  and  improve  per-
formance,  and  fuel  cell  materials  and  components  to  reduce  their
cost and improve their durability. Over the past four years, our re-
search  has  reduced  the  high  volume  costs  of  automotive  fuel  cells
from  $275  per  kilowatt  in  2002  to  $107  per  kilowatt  in  2006,  a
major step towards the ultimate cost target of $30 per kilowatt for
commercial production.

For  solar  energy,  the  budget  request  is  $148.3  million,  a  level
that is nearly twice that which was enacted in fiscal year 2006. To
lower  costs  more  rapidly  and  improve  performance,  the  Depart-
ment’s  photovoltaic  R&D,  for  example,  focuses  on  those  technology
pathways  that  have  the  greatest  potential  to  reach  cost  competi-
tiveness and grid parity by or before 2015.

And  we  are  emphasizing  efficiency  with  our  Building  Tech-
nologies  Program,  which  targets  a  long-term  goal  of  cost-neutral
net  zero  energy  buildings,  houses  that  produce  as  much  energy  as
they  use  on  an  annual  basis  by  2020.  And  in  the  near-term,  our
R&D has helped industry to produce a white Light Emitting Diode,
or  LED,  lamps  which  set  a  world  record  for  LED  brightness  and
efficacy in the use of a power chip.

Our Wind Program focuses on reducing wind power costs and re-
moving barriers to resource utilization to enable maximum market
penetration  of  wind  energy  technology  across  the  U.S.,  so  that  do-
mestic emission-free clean energy may one day contribute up to 20
percent of our national generation portfolio.

Our  Industrial  Technologies  Program  leverages  its  innovative
technology  transfer  practices  and  highly  successful  partnerships
with  energy-intensive  industries,  as  well  as  supporting  develop-
ment  of  next  generation  technologies  to  revolutionize  U.S.  indus-
trial  processes,  including  those  for  nanomanufacturing,  that  ulti-
mately  enhance  our  competitiveness,  and  deliver  dramatic  energy
and environmental benefits.

My written statement, of course, includes greater detail on these
and  our  other  programs,  but  this  concludes  my  opening  remarks,
and I would be happy to answer any questions the Committee may
have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Karsner follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALEXANDER KARSNER

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
testify on the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 budget request for the Office of En-
ergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).

The President’s FY 2008 budget request includes $1.24 billion for EERE, approxi-
mately  $60  million  (five  percent)  more  than  the  FY  2007  request  to  Congress.  To
be  clear,  my  testimony  today  on  the  FY  2008  budget  request  is  presented  in  com-
parison  to  the  Administration’s  FY  2007  request—not  the  final  amounts  appro-
priated in the 2007 Continuing Resolution (CR). In accordance with the terms of the
2007  CR,  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  is  in  the  process  of  preparing  an  oper-
ating  plan  for  submittal  to  Congress.  EERE  received  an  increase  in  funding  under
the  CR,  and  I  am  grateful  to  Congress  for  its  strong  commitment  to  energy  effi-
ciency and renewable energy programs.

The  FY  2008  budget  request  addresses  pressing  energy  and  environmental  chal-
lenges  facing  our  country  today  by  accelerating  the  development  of  both  renewable
energy  technologies  to  increase  the  amount  of  clean  energy  produced  in  the  United
States and advanced energy efficient technologies, standards, and practices that use
less energy. Much of EERE’s funding is an integral part of the President’s Advanced
Energy Initiative (AEI), launched in 2006 to confront our addiction to oil, lessen de-
pendence on foreign resources, and reduce emissions by developing clean sources of
electricity  generation.  Together,  new  technologies  can  help  change  the  way  we
power our homes, businesses, and automobiles.

In  his  2007  State  of  the  Union  address,  the  President  raised  the  bar  by  seeking
legislative  action  for  our  country  to  reduce  gasoline  consumption  by  20  percent  in
the next 10 years, the ‘‘20 in 10’’ plan. The FY 2008 budget request increases fund-
ing  for  programs  that  may  help  the  Nation  achieve  the  ‘‘20  in  10’’  goal,  including,
for example, biomass/biofuels R&D that may help to expand the availability of alter-
native transportation fuels.

EERE’s  applied  science  R&D  contributes  to  the  foundation  for  transforming  the
Nation’s  energy  options  and  energy  use.  For  example,  one  of  this  year’s  R&D  100
awards  went  to  the  Department’s  Idaho  National  Laboratory  for  its  work  with
Xtreme  Xylanase,  an  enzyme  produced  by  bacteria  found  in  the  hot,  acidic  waters
of  Yellowstone  National  Park.  Work  on  Xtreme  Xylanase  was  funded  in  part  by
EERE’s Biomass Program. The metabolic versatility of this enzyme (it breaks down
cellulose and hemicellulose over a broad range of temperatures and acidic pH condi-
tions)  could  help  make  cellulosic  ethanol  more  efficiently  and  economically.  In  the

field  of  solar  energy,  a  new  world-record  40  percent  efficient  concentrating  photo-
voltaic  solar  cell  was  developed  as  a  result  of  collaboration  between  DOE,  the  Na-
tional  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  and  Spectrolab.  For  general  lighting  applica-
tions with solid-state lighting, Cree, Inc., with DOE R&D funding, has released the
new  XLamp®  7090  power  white  light-emitting  diode  (LED),  setting  a  world  record
for LED brightness and efficacy (at 85 lumens/Watt) in a power chip.

It is essential, however, that, we work not only to accelerate R&D for new energy
technologies,  but  address  the  accelerated  adoption  of  technologies  into  commercial
products that are widely available at reasonable cost to all Americans. Thus, in ad-
dition  to  its  historical  role  of  leading  federal  applied  science  on  emerging  tech-
nologies,  EERE  is  taking  aggressive  steps  to  catalyze  the  rapid  commercialization
and deployment of critical energy advances through innovative partnerships and col-
laboration with lenders and investment groups, the States, and industry leaders. We
seek  to  help  enable  and  accelerate  market  transformation  toward  the  use  of  more
efficient and cleaner technologies.

EERE’s overall budget request reflects the funding needed to meet our goals. The
following EERE programs target and support sectors of energy use and supply that
will help lead our nation to a secure energy future:
BIOMASS AND BIOREFINERY SYSTEMS R&D

The FY 2008 budget request for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D is $179.3
million, an increase of $29.6 million, almost 20 percent above the FY 2007 request.
This  proposed  funding  increase  reflects  the  essential  role  of  the  Biofuels  Initiative
in  increasing  America’s  energy  security.  Biomass  is  the  most  viable  renewable  op-
tion  for  producing  liquid  transportation  fuels  in  the  near-term,  with  the  potential
to help reduce our dependence on imported oil.

The  focus  of  the  program  is  to  make  cellulosic  ethanol  cost-competitive  by  2012.
EERE will continue in FY 2008 to support its cost-share efforts with industry to de-
velop and demonstrate technologies to enable cellulosic biorefineries for the produc-
tion of transportation fuels and co-products. The FY 2008 funding increase also sup-
ports the validation of advancing biomass conversion technologies and feedstocks in
biorefineries at approximately 10 percent of commercial scale. This effort enables in-
dustry  to  resolve  remaining  technical  and  process  integration  uncertainties  for  the
‘‘next generation’’ of biorefinery process technologies being examined at a significant,
but less-costly scale.

Ultimately, 10 percent scale demonstrations have the potential to reduce the over-
all cost and risk to industry along with improving the likelihood of obtaining financ-
ing for commercial-scale facilities.

The  FY  2008  funding  increase  will  also  support  EERE  cost-shared  projects  with
industry  for  enzyme  development  for  producing  low  cost  sugars  from  biomass  and
for improved organism development or ‘‘ethanologen’’ for converting those sugars to
ethanol.  These  two  industry  cost-share  projects  address  major  barriers  to  meeting
the  2012  cost  goal.  Overall  knowledge  gained  from  Section  932  projects,  10  percent
validation  scale  projects,  enzyme  development,  and  ethanologen  R&D,  combined
with  other  key  R&D  activities,  should  accelerate  industry’s  ability  to  produce  cost-
competitive cellulosic ethanol.

To  address  biomass  resource  availability  and  feedstock  infrastructure  to  reduce
the  cost  and  improve  the  storage  of  delivered  biomass  in  different  geographical
areas  of  the  U.S.,  EERE  will  continue  to  support  the  Regional  Feedstock  Partner-
ship work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and land grant colleges.
These  partnerships  will  help  identify  the  regional  biomass  supply,  growth,  and  bio-
refinery development opportunities.

In  order  to  capture  and  coordinate  federal-wide  activities  supporting  the  Presi-
dent’s goal, the Biomass Program is developing a National Biofuels Action Plan com-
missioned  through  the  Biomass  Research  and  Development  Initiative.  The  Biomass
Program will also establish the framework for an ethanol reverse auction in accord-
ance  with  Section  942  of  EPACT  2005.  The  auction  will  award  incentives  on  a  per
gallon basis of cellulosic biofuels produced.
VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM

In  FY  2008,  the  Department  is  requesting  $176.1  million  for  the  Vehicle  Tech-
nologies  Program  to  advance  development  of  increasingly  more  energy-efficient  and
environmentally friendly, flexible platform technologies for cars and trucks that will
use  significantly  less  oil  and  enable  the  auto  industry  to  comply  with  reformed
CAFE  standards.  This  request  is  $10.1  million  higher  than  the  FY  2007  request,
and  will  advance  the  state-of-the-art  for  energy  storage  batteries,  power  electronics
and motors, and the hybrid drive systems and testing needed to accelerate manufac-
turing viability and delivery of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

Activities  in  the  Vehicle  Technologies  Program  contribute  to  two  cooperative  gov-
ernment/industry  activities:  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership  (where  CAR
stands  for  Cooperative  Automotive  Research)  and  the  21st  Century  Truck  Partner-
ship.  The  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership  is  a  collaborative  effort  among  the
U.S.  Council  for  Automotive  Research  (USCAR—representing  the  three  domestic
automobile manufacturers), five energy suppliers, and DOE for cooperative, pre-com-
petitive  research  on  advanced  automotive  technologies  having  significant  potential
to  reduce  oil  consumption.  The  21st  Century  Truck  Partnership  focuses  on  commer-
cial  vehicles.  The  partnership  involves  key  members  of  the  commercial  vehicle  in-
dustry,  (truck  equipment  manufacturers  and  engine  manufacturers)  along  with
three  other  federal  agencies.  The  R&D  centers  on  improving  advanced  combustion
engine systems and fuels and on reducing vehicle parasitic losses, meaning frictional
and  aerodynamic  losses,  extra  loads  like  air  conditioning,  and  other  vehicle  ineffi-
ciencies that increase fuel consumption.

Vehicle  Technologies  Program  activities  that  support  the  goals  of  the
FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership focus on high-efficiency and flexible platform ve-
hicle  technologies  such  as  advanced  combustion  engines  and  their  enabling  fuels,
hybrid vehicle systems (including plug-in hybrids), high-power and high-energy bat-
teries,  light-weight  materials,  and  power  electronics.  These  technologies  could  lead
to  substantial  oil  savings  if  adopted  by  industry  participants  and  included  in  their
manufacturing plans.

The  FreedomCAR  goals  include  reducing  the  volume  production  cost  of  a  high-
power  25kW  battery  for  use  in  hybrid  passenger  vehicles  from  $3,000  in  1998  to
$500 by 2010. In 2006 we projected through the modeling of research data that lith-
ium ion battery cost could be reduced to $750 per 25 kW battery system when pro-
duced in mass quantities. This year’s request increases the emphasis on plug-in hy-
brid  vehicle  component  technologies.  Cited  by  the  President  as  a  key  part  of  the
strategy  for  reducing  America’s  dependence  on  oil,  these  technologies  offer  the  po-
tential  to  make  significant  additional  improvements  in  petroleum  reduction  beyond
that achievable with standard hybrid configurations.

Combustion  engine  efficiency  has  made  good  progress  over  the  past  three  years
(2004–2006), with our R&D increasing the efficiency of light-duty passenger vehicle
diesel  engines  from  35  to  41  percent.  This  means  that  if  manufacturers  were  to
produce  these  more  efficient  engines,  a  car  that  previously  got  the  CAFE  average
of  27  miles  per  gallon  on  gasoline  could  potentially  get  37  miles  per  gallon  with  an
advanced, clean diesel. In FY 2008, we expect to reach 43 percent efficiency for pas-
senger  vehicle  diesel  engines,  approaching  the  2010  goal  of  45  percent.  These  ad-
vanced combustion engines have the potential to achieve the efficiency goals for cars
and trucks while maintaining cost and durability with near-zero emissions. Battery
technologies  have  also  made  significant  progress  toward  program  goals,  having  re-
duced  the  cost  of  next-generation  hybrid  vehicle  batteries  in  each  of  the  past  three
years,  from  almost  $1,200  per  vehicle  at  the  beginning  of  FY  2004  to  $750  at  the
end of FY 2006. In FY 2008, we expect to bring that down to $625 per vehicle, and
to increase our emphasis on batteries specifically optimized for plug-in hybrid vehi-
cles to have battery technology ready by 2014 that will enable automobile manufac-
turers to economically produce competitive plug-in hybrid vehicles having a 40 mile
all-electric range.

R&D  programs  will  also  continue  to  accelerate  materials  research  directed  at
light, strong vehicle structures to enable the production of lighter vehicles that could
result in higher efficiency fleets, and to develop thermoelectric materials for efficient
energy  recovery  from  heat.  Other  activities  will  focus  on  expanding  efforts  to  pro-
mote  the  adoption  and  use  of  petroleum-reducing  fuels,  technologies,  and  practices,
principally by working with industry partners, fuel providers, Clean Cities coalitions
and  their  stakeholders,  and  end-users  on  activities  ranging  from  using  more  alter-
native fuel vehicles and renewable fuel blends to driving smarter, minimizing waste-
ful idle time, and purchasing vehicles that get better fuel economy. Accordingly, the
Vehicle  Technologies  Deployment  budget  request  (including  Clean  Cities)  will  in-
crease by over 100 percent relative to the FY 2007 request.
HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM

Hydrogen  is  an  important  element  of  our  nation’s  long-term  strategy  for  energy
security  and  environmental  stewardship.  It  could  enhance  our  energy  security  by
providing a transportation fuel that may be produced from a variety of domestic re-
sources; and it should serve our environmental interests by allowing vehicles to op-
erate  using  fuel  cells,  without  generating  any  tailpipe  emissions.  The  Department’s
research is focused on pathways that produce and deliver hydrogen from diverse ori-
gins including emission-free nuclear, and renewable resources.

The  President’s  $309  million  FY  2008  budget  request  for  DOE  for  the  Hydrogen
Fuel  Initiative  fulfills  his  commitment  of  $1.2  billion  over  five  years.  The  portion
of  this  under  our  purview  in  EERE  is  $213  million,  which  reflects  a  $17.2  million
increase over the FY 2007 budget request. The proposed increase will accelerate and
expand  efforts  to  research  and  develop  hydrogen-storage  systems  to  improve  per-
formance, and fuel cell materials and components to reduce their cost, and improve
durability.  It  will  also  support  accelerating  cost  reduction  of  renewable  hydrogen
production technologies as well as critical delivery technologies.

Much progress has been made since the announcement of the Hydrogen Fuel Ini-
tiative  in  2003.  The  research  has  reduced  the  high-volume  cost  of  automotive  fuel
cells from $275 per kilowatt in 2002 to $107 per kilowatt in 2006—a major step to-
wards  the  ultimate  cost  target  of  $30  per  kilowatt.  In  FY  2008,  we  will  continue
projects  on  fuel  cell  catalysts  and  membranes,  and  cold-weather  start-up  and  oper-
ation.  In  addition  to  reducing  cost  and  improving  performance,  this  work  will  help
us achieve our 2010 durability target of 5,000 hours, which should enable a vehicle
lifetime of 150,000 miles.

We  have  also  achieved  our  2006  hydrogen  cost  goal  of  $3  per  gasoline-gallon-
equivalent  for  hydrogen  produced  by  distributed  reforming  of  natural  gas,  a  poten-
tially economical early market pathway. Our research will sharpen its focus to meet
the same objective through renewable pathways—including reforming of bio-derived
liquids  and  electrolysis.  We  are  also  working  with  the  Department’s  Offices  of  Nu-
clear Energy, Fossil Energy, and Science to develop nuclear-based hydrogen produc-
tion,  hydrogen  from  coal—exclusively  with  carbon  sequestration—and  longer-term
biological and photoelectrochemical hydrogen production pathways.

Our diverse hydrogen-storage portfolio is also showing promising results, with in-
novative  materials  being  developed  in  areas  such  as  metal  hydrides,  chemical  hy-
drides,  and  carbon-based  materials.  Research  conducted  at  our  ‘‘Centers  of  Excel-
lence,’’  and  by  independent  projects,  has  continued  to  increase  material  storage  ca-
pacity.  Substantial  breakthroughs  are  required  to  reach  our  goal  of  providing  con-
sumers  with  enough  storage  for  a  300-mile  driving  range,  without  compromising  a
vehicle’s interior space.

Developing hydrogen technologies that can be manufactured domestically will also
improve our economic competitiveness. Our manufacturing R&D effort addresses the
need  for  high-volume  fabrication  processes  for  fuel  cells  and  many  other  compo-
nents,  which  are  all  currently  built  one-at-a-time.  This  is  essential  to  lowering  the
cost of these technologies, and to developing a domestic supplier base.

In addition to these R&D activities, we are addressing other challenges significant
to  realizing  the  benefits  of  hydrogen  fuel  cells.  Our  Technology  Validation  Program
has  brought  together  teams  of  automobile  manufacturers  and  energy  companies  to
operate  and  evaluate  fuel  cell  vehicles  and  hydrogen  stations  under  real-world  con-
ditions.  To  date,  the  program  has  placed  69  fuel  cell  vehicles  on  the  road,  served
by 10 hydrogen fueling stations.

Furthermore,  we  are  working  to  ensure  safe  practices,  and—through  support  of
existing codes and standards development organizations—we are laying the ground-
work  for  developing  technically  sound  codes  and  standards,  which  are  essential  to
implementing hydrogen technologies.

Finally,  our  education  activities  focus  on  overcoming  the  knowledge  barriers  in-
herent in the introduction of new technology. Last month, we released a multimedia
web-based  course  that  introduces  hydrogen  to  first  responders.  In  the  coming  year,
we will continue to expand the availability of training and conduct outreach to raise
awareness of the technology.

The effects of the Department’s broad-based efforts in the Hydrogen Program are
being seen nationwide, and progress has been substantial. Investments are not only
occurring at the federal level, but also at state and local levels. These diverse invest-
ments  increase  our  probability  of  success  in  overcoming  existing  technological  bar-
riers,  which  will  allow  industry  to  make  fuel  cell  vehicles  that  customers  will  want
to  buy,  and  encourage  investment  in  a  hydrogen  refueling  infrastructure  that  is
profitable.
SOLAR ENERGY PROGRAM

The  Solar  Energy  Program  sponsors  research,  development,  and  deployment  of
solar  energy  technologies  and  systems  that  can  help  our  Nation  meet  electricity
needs  and  reduce  the  stress  on  our  electricity  infrastructure.  Through  the  Solar
America Initiative (SAI), the Solar Program aims to accelerate the market competi-
tiveness  of  solar  electricity  as  industry-led  teams  compete  to  deliver  solar  systems
that are less expensive, more efficient, and highly reliable. The Solar Program sup-
ports  three  technology  areas:  photovoltaics  (PV),  concentrating  solar  power  (CSP),

and  solar  heating  and  lighting.  The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  Solar  Energy  is
$148.3 million, a level that is nearly twice the enacted FY 2006 level.

To lower costs more rapidly and improve performance, the Department’s PV R&D,
budgeted  in  FY  2008  at  $137.3  million,  focuses  on  those  technology  pathways  that
have  the  greatest  potential  to  reach  cost-competitiveness  and  grid  parity  by  or  be-
fore  2015.  Industry-led  partnerships  with  universities,  state  groups  and  National
Laboratories,  known  as  ‘‘Technology  Pathway  Partnerships,’’  will  continue  in  FY
2008 to address the issues of cost, performance, and reliability associated with each
pathway. Work on PV modules, the heart of PV systems, will be conducted, as well
as other ‘‘balance-of-system’’ components.

To  catalyze  market  transformation,  DOE  will  promote  the  expansion  of  the  solar
marketplace  by  seizing  opportunities  for  growth  and  by  lowering  barriers  to  entry.
The  Department  will  provide  technical  outreach  to  States  and  utilities,  continue
pressing  work  on  codes  and  standards  issues,  and  solicit  new  applications  for  its
Solar America Cities activity. These market transformation activities help pave the
way  for  technologies  developed  by  our  industry  partnerships  to  enter  the  market-
place.

We will emphasize the importance of interconnection standard procedures and net
metering  regulations  that  are  designed  to  accommodate  solar  and  other  clean  dis-
tributed  energy  systems.  A  precondition  for  large-scale  solar  market  penetration  in
America  is  to  have  the  proper  means  for  homeowners  and  businesses  to  connect
solar  systems  to  the  grid,  as  well  as  to  be  paid  for  excess  electricity  they  feed  back
into  the  grid.  We  are  working  with  our  colleagues  in  the  Department’s  Office  of
Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy  Reliability  to  develop  ‘‘best  practice’’  recommenda-
tions for States to use as they undertake consideration of interconnection procedures
and  net  metering  regulations  and  make  implementation  decisions  pursuant  to  Sec-
tions  1251  and  1254  of  EPACT  2005.  FY  2008  funding  will  also  be  used  to  offer
technical outreach to States and utilities to enhance solar connectivity issues.

Work  will  continue  on  the  multi-year  solicitations  launched  in  FY  2007  that  pro-
mote  adoption  of  market-ready  solar  technologies  and  a  new  effort  will  support
benchmarking, modeling, and analysis for the systems driven approach, and market,
value  and  policy  analysis  needed  to  support  the  SAI.  EERE’s  PV  activities  are  in-
creasingly coordinated and when possible convergent with solar energy activities in
the  Building  Technologies  and  the  Federal  Energy  Management  programs,  and  the
research activities of the DOE Office of Science.

The FY 2008 budget request for CSP—systems that utilize heat generated by con-
centrating  and  absorbing  the  sun’s  energy  to  drive  a  heat  engine/generator  to
produce  electric  power—is  $9.0  million.  The  development  of  advanced  thermal  en-
ergy storage technologies will be expanded, along with continued support to develop
next  generation  parabolic  trough  concentrators,  solar  engines,  and  receivers.  For
distributed applications, research will focus on improving the reliability of dish sys-
tems  through  the  operation  and  testing  of  multiple  units.  Technical  assistance  will
be  provided  to  industry  in  its  development  of  a  1.0  MW  dish  system  in  California
that is expected to be the precursor of several much larger plants. Technical support
will  also  be  provided  to  the  Western  Governors’  Association  and  several  south-
western utilities to assist their CSP deployment activities.

The  Solar  Heating  and  Lighting  program,  a  $2.0  million  request,  will  focus  on
R&D to reduce the cost of solar heating in freezing climates. The program will also
support collaboration with EERE’s Building Technologies programs to integrate pho-
tovoltaic systems, solar water heating, and solar space heating into home design and
structure.  Such  deployment  efforts  will  help  to  seize  market  expansion  opportuni-
ties.
BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM

Energy  use  by  residential  and  commercial  buildings  accounts  for  over  one-third
of the Nation’s total energy consumption, including two-thirds of the electricity gen-
erated  in  the  United  States.  Addressing  that  significant  sector  of  energy  consump-
tion,  the  $86.5  million  requested  this  year  for  the  Building  Technologies  Program
represents a $9.1 million increase of 12 percent over the FY 2007 request. The fund-
ing  supports  a  portfolio  of  activities  that  includes  solid  state  lighting,  improved  en-
ergy efficiency of other building components and equipment and their effective inte-
gration using whole-building-system design technique, the development of codes and
standards for buildings and appliances, and education and market introduction pro-
grams, including ENERGY STAR and EnergySmart Schools.

Funding for Residential Buildings Integration aims to enable residential buildings
to use up to 70 percent less energy, and to integrate renewable energy systems into
highly  efficient  buildings  to  achieve  the  long-term  goal  in  2020  of  net  Zero  Energy
Buildings—houses  that  produce  as  much  energy  as  they  use  on  an  annual  basis.

48

During  FY  2008,  research  for  production-ready  new  residential  buildings  that  are
40 percent more efficient will continue for four climate zones.

The $19.3 million request for solid state lighting will advance development of the
organic and inorganic LEDs that has the potential to double the efficiency of fluores-
cent  lighting  technology.  The  FY  2008  requested  funding  will  be  used  to  develop
general illumination technologies with the goal of achieving energy efficiencies of up
to  93  lumens  per  Watt  with  improved  visual  comfort  and  quality  of  light  and  focus
on applied research that enables the industrial base to manufacture LEDs.

The  FY  2008  request  reflects  the  Department’s  commitment  to  clear  the  backlog
of  equipment  standards  and  test  procedures  that  had  accumulated  in  the  prior  12
years  and  meet  the  statutory  schedule  for  rule-makings  for  new  products  covered
by EPACT 2005. The Department will continue to implement productivity enhance-
ments  that  will  allow  multiple  rule-making  activities  to  proceed  simultaneously,
while maintaining the rigorous technical and economic analysis required by statute.
Funds  for  the  Building  Technologies  Program  will  also  support  development  of
highly  insulating  and  dynamic  window  technologies  and  integrated  attic-roof  sys-
tems  needed  to  achieve  long-term  zero  energy  building  goals.  Efforts  to  accelerate
the  adoption  of  efficient  building  technologies  by  consumers  and  businesses  include
expanded  ENERGY  STAR  specifications  and  labels  for  more  products,  promotion  of
advanced  building  efficiency  codes,  and  public-private  partnerships  to  advance  effi-
cient schools, hospitals, commercial lighting, and home building.
FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The  Federal  Energy  Management  Program  (FEMP)  assists  federal  agencies,  in-
cluding DOE, in increasing their use of energy efficiency and renewable energy tech-
nologies  through  alternative  financing  contract  support  and  technical  assistance,
and  coordinates  federal  reporting  and  evaluation  of  agency  progress  each  year.  As
the  single  largest  energy  consumer  in  the  U.S.,  the  Federal  Government  must  set
an example and lead the Nation toward becoming a cleaner, more efficient consumer
by  using  existing  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  technologies  and  tech-
niques.  On  January  24,  2007,  President  Bush  signed  a  new  Executive  Order  to
strengthen  the  environmental,  energy,  and  transportation  management  of  federal
agencies which includes a requirement for agencies to reduce their energy intensity
by three percent each year until 2015, compared with a 2003 baseline.

The  FY  2008  request  for  FEMP  is  $16.8  million,  a  slight  decrease  of  $0.1  million
from  the  FY  2007  request.  We  are  requesting  $7.9  million  for  FEMP  alternative  fi-
nancing programs that help agencies access private sector financing to fund energy
improvements  without  the  use  of  current  appropriations.  We  expect  to  achieve  not
less  than  $160  million  in  private  sector  investment  through  Super  ESPCs,  Energy
Savings  Performance  Contracts,  and  Utility  Energy  Service  Contracts  (UESCs),
which will result in about 15 trillion Btus in energy saved over the life cycle of the
projects.  Furthermore,  we  are  requesting  $6.5  million  for  Technical  Guidance  and
Assistance  to  help  federal  energy  managers  identify,  design,  and  implement  new
construction  and  facility  improvement  projects  that  incorporate  energy  efficiency
and  renewable  energy.  FEMP  will  assist  federal  agencies  in  meeting  the  increased
energy  efficiency  goals,  established  by  the  new  Executive  Order,  by  orienting  its
Technical  Guidance  and  Assistance,  Training,  and  Outreach  activities  towards  at-
tracting  private-sector  financing  for  investment  into  energy  efficiency  at  federal  fa-
cilities.  In  addition  to  the  focus  on  facility  energy  consumption,  FEMP  also  tracks
alternative fuel use in federal vehicle fleets.

In FY 2008, the Departmental Energy Management Program (DEMP) is being dis-
continued.  FEMP  will  still  provide  policy  guidance  and  technical  assistance  to  the
Department,  but  DOE  has  determined  that  the  management  of  energy  efficiency
and  renewable  investments  at  its  facilities  can  be  more  effectively  conducted  by
those facilities. While not reported separately, DOE national labs and other facilities
spend  significant  funding  (direct  and  indirect)  on  energy  efficiency  improvements,
while also using ESPCs and UESCs where appropriate.
WIND ENERGY PROGRAM

The  Wind  Program  focuses  on  reducing  wind  power  costs  and  removing  barriers
to  resource  utilization  of  wind  energy  technology  in  the  United  States.  The  pro-
gram’s FY 2008 request is $40.1 million.

As  a  result  of  thirty  years  of  R&D,  wind  turbines  can  now  provide  cost-effective,
reliable  clean  energy  in  high  wind  speed  areas.  While  we  will  continue  to  do  R&D
to  improve  wind  energy  technologies  in  low  wind  speed  areas,  we  are  also  focusing
on  near-term  actions  to  remove  existing  barriers  to  increasing  the  use  of  wind  en-
ergy,  building  on  the  current  robust  market  for  wind  energy  in  the  U.S.  These  ef-
forts  could  help  to  set  the  path  for  the  wind  industry  to  accelerate  its  penetration

49

of  delivered  emission-free  energy,  significantly  expanding  beyond  the  roughly  one
percent of installed electrical generating capacity today.

The  program  is  expanding  application  and  deployment-related  activities.  The
$12.9  million  requested  for  Systems  Integration  and  Technology  Acceptance  will
help  wind  technologies  entering  the  market  to  overcome  key  obstacles  such  as  grid
integration,  siting,  permitting,  and  environmental  barriers.  In  addition,  there  will
be increased support to address issues of pre-competitive turbine reliability and per-
formance  via  efforts  of  National  Laboratories  and  Cooperative  Research  and  Devel-
opment Agreements or ‘‘CRADAs’’ with industry. The Wind Program will also estab-
lish  a  federal  interagency  siting  group  to  minimize  regulatory  delays  on  wind
projects.

The  Wind  Program  is  funding  a  broader  effort  on  distributed  wind  technologies
and  applications  to  advance  the  full  scope  of  diverse  opportunities  for  wind  energy
on the distribution side of the electric power system.

A  U.S.  wind  industry-wide  roadmapping  analysis,  being  supported  by  the  DOE
wind  program,  is  underway  to  determine  the  technical  feasibility  for  wind  energy
to generate 20 percent of our nation’s electricity. To achieve this vision it would re-
quire  grid  modernization,  expansion,  and  integration,  and  removal  of  other  deploy-
ment  barriers.  Success  would  enable  delivery  of  more  than  300  gigawatts  of  new,
clean,  affordable,  and  domestic  production  capacity  to  our  urban  load  centers  and
be  a  substantial  contributor  to  economic  growth,  manufacturing,  and  rural  pros-
perity.  EERE  will  work  with  DOE’s  Office  of  Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy  Reli-
ability  on  several  studies  aimed  at  expanding  electricity  transmission  between  re-
mote wind resources and urban areas.
WEATHERIZATION AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM

In FY 2008, we are requesting $204.9 million for Weatherization and Intergovern-
mental Activities, a $20.1 million decrease from the FY 2007 request. The reduction
is primarily related to the decrease in the amounts requested for the Weatherization
Assistance Program, which will enable greater investments in advanced R&D within
the  EERE  portfolio  to  address  national  priorities:  reducing  dependence  on  foreign
oil,  accelerating  the  development  of  clean,  emission-free  electricity  supply  options,
and  developing  highly  efficient  new  technologies,  products,  and  practices  for  our
homes and buildings.

The  requested  $144  million  for  the  Weatherization  Assistance  Program  will  fund
energy  efficiency  audits  and  upgrades  for  at  least  54,599  low-income  homes.  DOE
works  directly  with  States  and  certain  Native  American  Tribes  that  contract  with
local  governmental  or  non-profit  agencies  to  deliver  weatherization  services  to
homes in need of energy assistance.

The $45.5 million requested for the State Energy Program provides financial and
technical  assistance  to  State  governments,  enabling  them  to  target  their  high  pri-
ority  energy  needs  and  expand  clean  energy  choices  for  their  citizens  and  busi-
nesses.  This  request  includes  $10.5  million  for  a  competitive  solicitation  that  will
seek  regional  and  state  partnerships  to  replicate  smart  energy  policies  and  pro-
grams among States. The regional context is outlined in EPACT and aligns with our
electricity transmission infrastructure.

Clean  electricity  generation  is  targeted  by  the  Renewable  Energy  Production  Ini-
tiative, which provides financial incentive payment to public and Tribal utilities and
not-for-profit  electric  cooperatives  for  renewable  generation  systems  that  use  solar,
wind,  geothermal,  or  biomass  technologies.  The  Tribal  Energy  Program  aims  to  fa-
cilitate the installation of 100 MW of renewable energy generation by Native Amer-
ican tribes by 2010.

The  Asia  Pacific  Partnership  (APP)  for  Clean  Development  and  Climate  requests
funding at the $7.5 million level. This international partnership is an important and
innovative  accord  to  accelerate  the  development  and  deployment  of  clean  energy
technologies among the six member countries: Australia, China, India, Japan, South
Korea, and the United States. Representing about half of the world’s economy, popu-
lation,  energy  use,  and  emissions,  the  six  countries  have  agreed  to  work  together
and with private sector partners to set and meet goals for energy security, national
air  pollution  reduction,  and  global  warming,  employing  policies  and  practices  that
promote  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  while  addressing  the
serious challenge of climate change.
INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAM

Industry  consumes  more  energy  than  the  residential,  commercial,  and  transpor-
tation end-use sectors, and it is also the Nation’s second largest emitter of CO2. Ad-
vancements in industrial energy-efficient technology could improve U.S. competitive-
ness,  and  contribute  to  our  national  effort  to  reduce  oil  imports,  alleviate  natural

50

gas  price  pressure,  and  preempt  the  need  for  new  power  plants  and  consequent
emissions.

The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  Industrial  Technologies  is  $46.0  million,  a  $0.4
million increase over the FY 2007 request. The program will leverage its innovative
technology  transfer  practices  and  partnerships  with  energy-intensive  industries,
while  shifting  toward  more  crosscutting  and  higher-impact  R&D  activities  that  will
bring innovative energy solutions to a much broader group of industrial companies,
at a more accelerated pace.

The Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) has a track record for moving innova-
tive technologies from R&D through commercialization and onto the floors of indus-
trial  plants.  In  2006  alone,  eight  technologies  funded  by  ITP  received  prestigious
R&D  100  awards.  New  technologies  emerging  from  ITP’s  R&D  program  are  being
adopted  to  help  solve  some  of  industry’s  toughest  energy  and  competitiveness  chal-
lenges.  In  many  cases,  this  is  occurring  through  the  industrial  energy  assessments
that  ITP  is  conducting  at  250  of  the  Nation’s  largest  energy-consuming  manufac-
turing plants as part of Secretary Bodman’s ‘‘Easy Ways to Save Energy’’ initiative.
We  estimate  that  ITP-sponsored  technologies  and  deployment  activities  have  con-
tributed to industrial energy savings of over $3.1 billion in one year (2004).

The  $7.2  million  requested  for  the  new  activity,  Energy-Intensive  Process  R&D,
will  support  R&D  in  four  crosscutting  areas  to  better  deliver  technology  solutions
for the industrial processes that consume the most energy. These four areas are En-
ergy  Conversion  Systems,  Industrial  Reaction  and  Separation,  High-Temperature
Processing,  and  Fabrication  and  Infrastructure.  One  example  of  a  technology  that
cuts  across  the  industrial  sector  to  deliver  savings  is  ITP’s  ultra-high  efficiency,
ultra-low emissions, industrial steam generation ‘‘Super Boiler.’’ Since steam is used
in  every  major  sector,  the  potential  benefits  are  tremendous.  The  Super  Boiler  is
10  to  20  percent  more  efficient  than  current  technology  and  can  reduce  NOΧ emis-
sions to below five parts per million, which represents an approximately 90 percent
reduction in emissions from a conventional boiler.

The  $4.9  million  request  for  the  new  Inter-Agency  Manufacturing  R&D  activity
working with the National Science and Technology Council will support the develop-
ment  or  adaptation  of  next-generation  technologies  that  can  revolutionize  U.S.  in-
dustrial  processes  and  deliver  dramatic  energy  and  environmental  benefits.  These
next-generation  technologies,  such  as  entirely  new  processing  routes  and  supply
chains,  can  have  broad  application  across  industry,  yet  they  typically  require  the
type of high-risk, high-return R&D that one industry cannot usually undertake. Our
initial  research  focus  will  include  development  of  techniques  and  processes  needed
for  nanomanufacturing.  We  aim  to  help  transform  industrial  processes  by  enabling
the  mass  production  and  application  of  nano-scale  materials,  structures,  devices,
and  systems  that  provide  unprecedented  energy,  cost,  and  productivity  benefits  in
manufacturing.

Deployment  efforts  such  as  ‘‘Best  Practices’’  activities  and  Industrial  Assessment
Centers will continue to deliver the results of energy-efficiency R&D and energy-sav-
ing practices to industrial plants nationwide. A vehicle for educational outreach, the
university-based  Industrial  Assessment  Centers  train  engineers  and  scientists  in
the energy field, providing opportunities for students to conduct energy assessments
at no cost to small and medium-sized manufacturing plants in the U.S.
FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

The  FY  2008  budget  request  of  $7.0  million  for  Facilities  and  Infrastructure,  an
increase  of  $1.0  million  from  the  FY  2007  request,  supports  the  operations  and
maintenance  of  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  in  Golden,  CO.
NREL  is  a  single-purpose  National  Laboratory  dedicated  to  R&D  for  energy  effi-
ciency,  renewable  energy,  and  related  technologies  that  provides  EERE,  as  well  as
DOE’s Office of Science and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability,
with R&D, expert advice, and programmatic counsel.
PROGRAM DIRECTION AND PROGRAM SUPPORT

The  Program  Direction  budget  supports  the  management  and  technical  direction
and  oversight  needed  to  implement  EERE  programs  at  both  headquarters  and  the
Project Management Center. Areas funded by this request include: federal salaries,
information  systems  and  technology  equipment,  office  space,  travel,  and  support
service contractors. The FY 2008 budget request for Program Direction totals $105.0
million,  a  $14.0  million  increase  over  the  FY  2007  request.  This  increase  reflects
EERE’s  updated  staffing  needs,  which  more  closely  align  critical  skills  to  mission
requirements and adds staff to support technical program staffing shortfalls and im-
plementation of the AEI and EPACT 2005 priorities.

51

The Program Support budget request provides resources for crosscutting perform-
ance  evaluation,  analysis,  and  planning  for  EERE  programs  and  for  technical  ad-
vancement and outreach activities. The information developed by the Program Sup-
port  components  provides  decision-makers  at  every  level  the  information  they  need
to make choices related to energy alternatives that can help the Department achieve
its  goals.  The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  Program  Support  activities  totals  $13.3
million, representing a $2.4 million increase from the FY 2007 budget request. The
increase  reflects  the  expansion  of  EERE’s  market  transformation  and  commer-
cialization  analysis  and  expanded  efforts  in  the  Technology  Advancement  and  Out-
reach Office.
CONCLUSION

Accelerating research, development, and deployment of America’s abundant clean
sources  of  energy  and  making  more  efficient  use  of  all  energy  consumed  is  central
to  EERE’s  mission,  and  to  a  secure  and  competitive  economic  future  that  enhances
our environmental well-being for our nation and our world. We believe the Adminis-
tration’s  FY  2008  budget  request  for  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  pro-
grams strategically positions the stepping stones that will continuously catalyze and
accelerate new energy sources, technologies, and practices into the marketplace, and
hasten  the  transformation  of  how  our  homes,  businesses,  and  vehicles  use  energy.
This  concludes  my  prepared  statement,  and  I  am  happy  to  answer  any  questions

the Committee Members may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ALEXANDER KARSNER

Alexander ‘‘Andy’’ Karsner was unanimously confirmed by the Senate as Assistant
Secretary  for  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE)  on  March  16,  2006
and sworn-in by Secretary of Energy Samuel W. Bodman on March 23, 2006.

Assistant  Secretary  Karsner  manages  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  $1.17
billion  EERE  office,  which  promotes  the  development  and  marketplace  integration
of renewable and environmentally sound energy technologies, as well as the preser-
vation  and  efficient  use  of  our  nation’s  valuable  resources.  Assistant  Secretary
Karsner  also  helps  lead  DOE’s  efforts  to  carry  out  the  Advanced  Energy  Initiative
(AEI), announced by President Bush in his 2006 State of the Union address, which
aims  to  accelerate  breakthroughs  in  the  way  we  power  our  cars,  homes,  and  busi-
nesses.

Previously,  Assistant  Secretary  Karsner  served  in  the  private  sector  on  a  wide
range  of  technologies  including  heavy  fuel  oil,  distillates,  natural  gas,  coal,  wood
waste/biomass, wind energy and distributed generation based upon renewable tech-
nologies.  He  has  been  responsible  for  and  taken  part  in  large-scale  power  projects
in  North  America,  Asia,  the  Middle  East,  North  Africa,  including  unprecedented
projects structuring in the Philippines and Pakistan.

In  2002,  Assistant  Secretary  Karsner  led  his  company,  Enercorp,  to  win  a  global
competition  to  develop  the  world’s  largest  private  wind  farm  outside  the  United
States at that time. He has worked with Tondu Energy Systems of Texas, Wartsila
Power  Development  of  Finland,  and  prominent  multinational  energy  firms  and  de-
velopers  including  ABB  of  Sweden,  RES  of  the  UK,  Tacke  of  Germany  (now  known
as GE Wind), and Vestas of Denmark.

Assistant  Secretary  Karsner  also  worked  on  behalf  of  the  International  Protocol
for  Hydrogen  Economy,  participating  in  meetings  and  ministerials  to  advance  the
President’s agenda for a new energy economy. He was played an integral role in ar-
ranging DOE’s U.S.-Morocco bilateral protocols for clean energy policy. Mr. Karsner
is currently co-leading the Department’s support for the Asia Pacific Pact to address
global emissions with market based mechanisms.

Assistant Secretary Karsner graduated with honors from Rice University, and re-
ceived  an  MA  from  Hong  Kong  University.  Mr.  Karsner  resides  with  his  wife  and
family in Alexandria, Virginia.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Karsner. Mr. Kolevar.

the  President’s  fiscal  year  2008  budget  request  for  the  Office  of
Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.

The mission of the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reli-
ability  (OE)  is  to  lead  national  efforts  to  modernize  the  electricity
delivery  system,  enhance  the  security  and  reliability  of  America’s
energy  infrastructure,  and  facilitate  recovery  from  disruptions  to
energy  supply.  These  functions  are  vital  to  the  Department  of  En-
ergy’s  strategic  goal  of  protecting  our  national  and  economic  secu-
rity  by  promoting  a  diverse  supply  and  delivery  of  reliable,  afford-
able, and environmentally responsible energy.

The  President’s  budget  includes  $114.9  million  for  OE  in  fiscal
year 2008, which represents an eight percent decrease from the fis-
cal  year  2007  request.  This  includes  $86  million  for  Research  and
Development  activities,  $11.6  million  for  Operations  and  Analysis
activities, and $17.4 million for program direction.

I  will  primarily  address  the  activities  of  OE’s  Research  and  De-
velopment program today. Our request of $86 million for fiscal year
2008 will fund the following four main activities: high temperature
superconductivity,  visualization  and  controls;  energy  storage  and
power  electronics;  and  renewable  and  distributed  systems  integra-
tion.  The  development  of  these  advanced  electricity  technologies
will  influence  the  future  of  all  aspects  of  the  electric  transmission
and distribution system.

The  first  activity  I  would  like  to  highlight  is  one  to  which  the
DOE  has  made  a  long-term  commitment.  This  is  the  science  and
development  of  high 
temperature  superconductivity.  Super-
conducting  cables  transmit  electricity  through  conductors  at  tem-
peratures  approaching  absolute  zero,  thus  preventing  resistance  to
electrical  voltage,  which  allows  large  amounts  of  electricity  to  be
transmitted  over  long  distances  with  little  line  loss.  Superconduc-
tivity,  therefore,  holds  the  promise  of  alleviating  capacity  concerns
while moving power reliably and efficiently.

Another  critical  piece  of  a  resilient  and  reliable  modern  grid  is
enhancing  the  security  of  our  control  systems.  Our  visualization
and  control  activity  focuses  on  improving  our  ability  to  measure
and  address  the  vulnerability  of  control  systems.  The  research  in
this  area  will  allow  us  to  detect  cyberintrusion,  implement  protec-
tive  measures  and  response  strategies,  and  sustain  cybersecurity
improvements over time.

Our  energy  storage  and  power  electronics  activity  is  a  mid-term
research endeavor to significantly reduce transmission system con-
gestion,  manage  peak  loads,  make  renewable  electricity  sources
more  dispatchable,  and  increase  the  reliability  of  the  overall  elec-
tric grid. This may be achieved through large-scale megawatt level
electricity storage systems, or multiple, smaller, distributed storage
systems.  Using  our  understanding  from  previous  energy  storage
demonstration  activities,  we  are  researching  and  developing  new,
advanced,  higher  energy  density  materials  and  storage  devices  for
utility  scale  application.  The  program  also  focuses  on  research  in
power  electronics  to  improve  material  and  device  properties  that
are needed for transmission level applications.

Finally,  in  fiscal  year  2007,  the  renewable  and  distributed  sys-
tems  integration  activity  completed  the  transition  away  from  gen-
eration technology activities, and will now focus on grid integration

53

of  distributed  and  renewable  systems  in  fiscal  year  2008.  This  is
a logical step in advancing clean energy resources to address future
energy challenges.

Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  know,  OE  also  carries  out  mission-critical
work within the Operations and Analysis Subprogram. These relate
principally to the implementation of EPAct requirements in energy
sector facility security and recovery.

In  his  2007  State  of  the  Union  Address,  President  Bush  empha-
sized the importance of continuing to change the way America gen-
erates  electric  power,  and  highlighted  the  significant  progress  we
have  already  made  in  integrating  clean  coal  technology,  solar  and
wind energy, and clean, safe, nuclear energy into the electric trans-
mission system.

Technologies  such  as  power  electronics,  high  temperature  super-
conductivity, and energy storage hold not only the promise of lower
costs  and  greater  efficiency,  but  also  directly  enhance  the  viability
of  clean  energy  resources  by  addressing 
issues  such  as
intermittency, controllability, and environmental impact.

We  cannot  simply  rely  on  innovative  policies  and  infrastructure
investment. We must also invest federal dollars in the research, de-
velopment, and deployment of new technologies in order to improve
grid  performance  and  ensure  our  energy  security,  economic  com-
petitiveness, and environmental well-being.

This  concludes  my  statement,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward  to

taking questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Kolevar follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF KEVIN M. KOLEVAR

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
testify  on  the  President’s  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2008  budget  request  for  the  Office  of
Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.

The mission of the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) is to
lead national efforts to modernize the electricity delivery system, enhance the secu-
rity  and  reliability  of  America’s  energy  infrastructure,  and  facilitate  recovery  from
disruptions  to  energy  supply.  These  functions  are  vital  to  the  Department  of  Ener-
gy’s  (DOE)  strategic  goal  of  protecting  our  national  and  economic  security  by  pro-
moting a diverse supply and delivery of reliable, affordable, and environmentally re-
sponsible energy.

The President’s FY 2008 budget includes $114.9 million for OE in FY 2008, which
is  an  eight  percent  decrease  from  the  FY  2007  request.  This  includes  $86.0  million
for  Research  and  Development  activities,  $11.6  million  for  Operations  and  Analysis
activities,  and  $17.4  million  for  Program  Direction.  As  DOE  is  currently  preparing
a  spending  plan  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  2007  Continuing  Resolution,
my testimony on the FY 2008 budget request reflects a comparison to the Adminis-
tration’s FY 2007 request.

When  Thomas  Edison  opened  the  Pearl  Street  Station  in  lower  Manhattan  on
September  4,  1884,  he  could  hardly  have  foreseen  of  the  role  electricity  would  play
in  the  development  of  American  society.  Although  the  demand  for  electric  lighting
and power initially drove the station’s construction, electricity ultimately stimulated
and  enabled  technological  innovations  that  reshaped  America.  Today,  the  avail-
ability and access to electricity is something that most Americans take for granted.
Most  people  cannot  describe  what  it  is  or  where  it  comes  from.  Yet,  it  is  vital  to
nearly  every  aspect  of  our  lives  from  powering  our  electronics  and  heating  our
homes  to  supporting  transportation,  finance,  food  and  water  systems,  and  national
security.

The Energy Information Administration has estimated that by the year 2030, U.S.
electricity  sales  are  expected  to  increase  by  43  percent  from  their  2005  level.  Al-
though  this  is  a  positive  indicator  of  a  growing  economy,  it  is  also  a  significant
amount of new demand on an electricity infrastructure that is already stressed and
aging.  With  this  in  mind,  OE’s  FY  2008  budget  request  reflects  a  commitment  to
implement  the  directives  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (EPACT),  support  re-

search  of  breakthrough  technologies,  and  coordinate  federal  response  to  temporary
disruptions  in  energy  supply  to  ensure  a  reliable  and  secure  electricity  infrastruc-
ture for every American in the coming decades.

Meeting our future electricity needs will not be solved by focusing only on expand-
ing  our  generation  portfolio  or  on  energy  conservation.  Perhaps  the  greatest  chal-
lenge  today,  as  it  was  in  Edison’s  time,  is  building  the  elaborate  network  of  wires
and other facilities needed to deliver energy to consumers reliably and safely.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The  FY  2008  budget  request  of  $86.0  million  for  the  Research  and  Development
(R&D)  program  within  OE  funds  four  activities:  High  Temperature  Superconduc-
tivity;  Visualization  and  Controls;  Energy  Storage  and  Power  Electronics;  and  Re-
newable and Distributed Systems Integration.

Over  the  past  eighteen  years,  DOE  has  invested  more  than  $500  million  in  the
science  and  development  of  high  temperature  superconductivity.  Superconductivity
holds  the  promise  of  addressing  capacity  concerns  by  maximizing  use  of  available
‘‘footprint’’  and  limited  space,  while  moving  power  efficiently  and  reliably.  It  also
supports  advanced  substation  and  interconnection  designs  that  allow  larger
amounts  of  power  to  be  routed  between  substations,  feeders,  and  networks  using
less space and improving the security and reliability of the electric system.

Today, the High Temperature Superconductivity activity continues to support sec-
ond generation wire development as well as research on dielectrics, cryogenics, and
cable  systems.  This  activity  is  being  refocused  to  address  a  near-term  critical  need
within  the  electric  system  to  not  only  increase  current  carrying  capacity,  but  also
to relieve overburdened cables elsewhere in the local grid. The superconductivity in-
dustry  in  the  United  States  is  now  at  the  critical  stage  of  moving  from  small  busi-
ness development to becoming a part of our manufacturing base.

Enhanced  security  for  control  systems  is  critical  to  the  development  of  a  reliable
and resilient modern grid. The Visualization and Controls Research & Development
activity focuses on improving our ability to measure and address the vulnerabilities
of  controls  systems,  detect  cyber  intrusion,  implement  protective  measures  and  re-
sponse strategies, and sustain cyber security improvements over time. The FY 2008
request reflects an increase of $7.75 million related to support this effort.

This activity is also developing the next generation system control and data acqui-
sition (SCADA) system that features GPS-synchronized grid monitoring, secure data
communications, custom visualization and operator cueing, and advanced control al-
gorithms. Advanced visualization and control systems will allow operators to detect
disturbances  and  take  corrective  action  before  problems  cascade  into  widespread
outages.  The  need  to  improve  electric  power  control  systems  security  is  well-recog-
nized by both the private and public sectors.

The  Energy  Storage  and  Power  Electronics  activity  proposes  an  increase  of  $3.80
million in FY 2008 to: 1) leverage understanding gained from previous Energy Stor-
age  demonstration  activities  to  research  and  develop  new  advanced  higher  energy
density  materials  and  storage  devices  for  utility  scale  application;  and  2)  focus  on
enhanced  research  in  Power  Electronics  to  improve  material  and  device  properties
needed for transmission-level applications.

Large  scale,  megawatt-level  electricity  storage  systems,  or  multiple,  smaller  dis-
tributed storage systems, could significantly reduce transmission system congestion,
manage  peak  loads,  make  renewable  electricity  sources  more  dispatchable,  and  in-
crease the reliability of the overall electric grid.

The Renewable and Distributed Systems Integration Research & Development ac-
tivity  completed  the  transition  away  from  generation  technology  activities  in  FY
2007 and will focus on grid integration of distributed and renewable systems in FY
2008,  which  is  a  logical  step  in  advancing  clean  energy  resources  to  address  future
challenges.
PERMITTING, SITING, AND ANALYSIS

In FY 2008, the Department is requesting $5.7 million for the Permitting, Siting,
and  Analysis  (PSA)  Office  within  the  Operations  and  Analysis  subprogram,  which
implements  mandatory  requirements  set  by  EPACT  to  modernize  the  electric  grid
and  enhance  reliability  of  the  energy  infrastructure  by  contributing  to  the  develop-
ment  and  implementation  of  electricity  policy  at  the  federal  and  State  level.  The
Permitting  Siting  and  Analysis  Office  is  also  tasked  with  analyzing  transmission
congestion, proposing energy corridors for the Secretary’s consideration, and coordi-
nating federal agency review of applications to site transmission facilities on federal
lands.

The  Department  published  its  National  Electric  Transmission  Congestion  Study
on  August  8,  2006,  in  compliance  with  Section  1221(a)  of  EPACT,  which  requires

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

DOE  to  prepare  a  study  of  electric  transmission  congestion  every  three  years.  The
study named more than fifteen areas of the Nation with existing or potential trans-
mission congestion problems. The study identifies Southern California and the East
Coast from New York City to Washington, D.C., as ‘‘Critical Congestion Areas,’’ be-
cause  transmission  congestion  in  these  densely  populated  and  economically  vital
areas is especially significant.

During the development of the study, which relied on extensive consultation with
States and other stakeholders, the Department provided numerous opportunities for
discussion  and  comment  by  States,  regional  planning  organizations,  industry,  and
the  general  public.  OE  intends  to  supplement  the  tri-annual  Congestion  Studies
study  by  publishing  annual  progress  reports  on  transmission  improvements  in  the
congested areas.

Section 1221(a) also requires the Secretary to issue a report based on the August
8  Congestion  Study.  In  this  report,  if  consumers  in  any  geographic  area  are  being
adversely affected by electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion,
the  Secretary  may,  at  his  discretion,  designate  such  an  area  as  a  National  Interest
Electric Transmission Corridor (National Corridor).

Because of the broad public interest in the implementation of Section 1221(a), the
Department  invited  and  received  over  400  public  comments  on  the  designation  of
National Corridors. The Department continues to evaluate these comments, and has
not  yet  determined  whether,  and  if  so,  where,  it  would  be  appropriate  to  propose
designation of National Corridors. Prior to issuing a report that designates any Na-
tional Corridor, the Department will first issue a draft designation to allow affected
States,  regional  entities,  and  the  general  public  additional  opportunities  for  review
and comment.

Another major effort involves the implementation of Section 368 of EPACT, which
requires  the  designation  of  energy  right-of-way  corridors  on  federal  lands  in  the
eleven contiguous Western States. An interagency team, with DOE as the lead agen-
cy,  conducted  public  scoping  meetings  concerning  the  designation  of  corridors  in
each  of  the  eleven  contiguous  Western  States.  The  agencies  plan  to  publish  a  draft
Programmatic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  the  designation  of  the  energy
corridors in late spring of 2007 and will solicit public comments.

In  August  2006,  DOE  and  eight  other  federal  agencies  signed  a  Memorandum  of
Understanding  (MOU)  that  clarifies  the  respective  roles  and  responsibilities  of  fed-
eral  agencies,  State  and  tribal  governments,  and  transmission  project  applicants
with respect to making decisions on transmission siting authorizations. DOE is pre-
paring to implement its responsibilities under the new section 216(h) of the Federal
Power  Act  to  coordinate  with  these  eight  other  federal  agencies  to  prepare  initial
calendars,  with  milestones  and  deadlines  for  the  federal  authorizations  and  related
reviews required for the siting of transmission facilities. DOE will maintain a public
website that will contain a complete record of federal authorizations and related en-
vironmental  reviews  and  will  work  closely  with  the  lead  Federal  NEPA  agency  to
encourage complete and expedited federal reviews. DOE is currently considering the
procedures it will use in carrying out this program.
INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AND ENERGY RESTORATION

The President has designated the Department of Energy as the Lead Sector Spe-
cific Agency responsible for facilitating the protection of the Nation’s critical energy
infrastructure.  The  Infrastructure  Security  and  Energy  Restoration  (ISER)  activity
of the Operations and Analysis subprogram is responsible for coordinating and car-
rying out the Department’s obligations to support the Department of Homeland Se-
curity in this important national initiative. The FY 2008 request is for $5.9 million
in funding for Infrastructure Security and Energy Restoration within the Operations
and Analysis subprogram.

The Infrastructure Security and Energy Restoration activity fulfills DOE’s respon-
sibilities as defined in Homeland Security Presidential Directives 7 and 8 for critical
infrastructure  identification,  prioritization,  and  protection  and  for  national  pre-
paredness.  In  times  of  declared  emergencies,  this  Office  also  coordinates  federal  ef-
forts  under  the  National  Response  Plan  to  assist  State  and  local  governments  and
the private sector in the restoration of electrical power and other energy-related ac-
tivities.

In  the  event  of  a  large-scale  electrical  power  outage  caused  by  natural  disasters
such  as  hurricanes,  ice  storms,  or  earthquakes,  DOE  personnel  will  deploy  to  the
affected region to assist in recovery efforts. During the 2005 hurricane season, DOE
was  specifically  deployed  to  respond  to  five  hurricanes:  Dennis,  Katrina,  Ophelia,
Rita and Wilma. In such instances, DOE coordinates all federal efforts to assist local
authorities  and  utilities  in  dealing  with  both  measures  to  restore  power  and  to  re-
solve other issues related to fuel supply.

56

The  Infrastructure  Security  and  Energy  Restoration  Office  also  fosters  greater
awareness of the regional scope of energy inter-dependencies by working with States
to develop energy assurance plans that address the potential cascading effects of en-
ergy  supply  problems.  Exercises  are  conducted  with  States  and  federal  partners  to
help sharpen this focus. Finally, staff work with States and DHS in emergency situ-
ations  to  help  resolve  issues  brought  on  by  temporary  energy  supply  disruptions,
such as the winter 2007 propane shortage in Maine.
CONCLUSION

In  his  2007  State  of  the  Union  address,  President  Bush  emphasized  the  impor-
tance  of  continuing  to  change  the  way  America  generates  electric  power  and  high-
lighted significant progress in integrating clean coal technology, solar and wind en-
ergy, and clean, safe nuclear energy into the electric transmission system.

Technologies  such  as  power  electronics,  high  temperature  superconductivity,  and
energy  storage  hold  the  promise  of  lower  costs  and  greater  efficiency,  and  also  di-
rectly  enhance  the  viability  of  clean  energy  resources  by  addressing  issues  such  as
intermittency, controllability, and environmental impact.

Federal  investment  in  the  research,  development,  and  deployment  of  new  tech-
nology combined with innovative policies and infrastructure investment, is essential
to improving grid performance and ensuring our energy security, economic competi-
tiveness, and environmental well-being.

This  concludes  my  statement,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward  to  answering  any

questions you and your colleagues may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR KEVIN M. KOLEVAR

In  February  2005,  Kevin  Kolevar  was  named  Director  of  the  Office  of  Electricity
Delivery and Energy Reliability at the United States Department of Energy. As Di-
rector,  Mr.  Kolevar  leads  the  development  and  implementation  of  national  policy
pertaining  to  electric  grid  reliability;  management  of  research,  development,  and
demonstration  activities  for  ‘‘next  generation’’  electric  grid  infrastructure  tech-
nologies; and leads federal efforts to help ensure and secure the reliable flow of en-
ergy.

Mr.  Kolevar  is  the  Department  lead  for  implementation  of  the  Electricity  Title  of
the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005.  His  responsibilities  have  included  analysis  of  elec-
tricity  congestion,  the  possible  designation  of  National  Interest  Electric  Trans-
mission  Corridors,  the  coordination  of  energy  corridors  across  federal  lands,  and

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  THOMAS  D.  SHOPE,  PRINCIPAL  DEPUTY
ASSISTANT  SECRETARY  FOR  FOSSIL  ENERGY,  U.S.  DEPART-
MENT OF ENERGY
Mr.  SHOPE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members
of  the  Committee,  it  is  my  honor  to  appear  before  you  today  to
present the Office of Fossil Energy’s proposed budget for fiscal year
2008.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

57

Fossil  Energy’s  $863  million  budget  request  for  fiscal  year  2008
will  allow  the  Office  to  support  the  President’s  top  initiatives  for
energy  security,  clean  air,  climate  change,  and  coal  research,  as
well  as  DOE’s  strategic  goal  of  protecting  our  national  and  eco-
nomic  security  by  promoting  a  diverse  supply  and  delivery  of  reli-
able, affordable, and environmentally sound energy.

Let  me  begin  the  presentation  of  our  budget  with  coal,  our  most
abundant  and  lowest  cost  domestic  fossil  fuel.  Coal  today  accounts
for  nearly  one  quarter  of  all  of  the  energy  and  more  than  half  of
the electricity produced in the United States. Because coal is so im-
portant  to  our  energy  future,  our  proposed  budget  of  $448  million
for  the  President’s  Coal  Research  Initiative,  related  fuel  cell  R&D,
and  program  direction  accounts—it  accounts  for  more  than  half  of
our total budget.

Our  overarching  goal  is  to  conduct  research  and  development
that will improve the competitiveness of domestic coal in future en-
ergy  markets,  allowing  the  Nation  to  tap  the  full  potential  of  its
abundant  fossil  energy  resources  in  an  environmentally  sound  and
affordable manner.

This year’s request completes, three years ahead of schedule, the
President’s  commitment  to  invest  $2  billion  on  clean  coal  research
over  ten  years.  Our  Coal  Research  Initiative  is  broken  down  into
the  following  components.  We  are  requesting  $73  million  for  the
Clean Coal Power Initiative, a cooperative, cost-shared program be-
tween the government and industry to demonstrate emergent tech-
nologies  in  coal-based  power  generation,  so  as  to  help  accelerate
commercialization.  Work  on  promising  technologies  selected  in  two
prior solicitations will continue in fiscal year 2008, and we plan to
announce a third solicitation during the year.

The first of a kind, high priority FutureGen project will establish
the  capability  and  feasibility  of  co-producing  electricity  and  hydro-
gen from coal with near-zero atmospheric emissions, including car-
bon dioxide. FutureGen’s proposed budget of $108 million for fiscal
year  2008  will  be  used  to  support  detailed  plant  design  and  pro-
curement and other preliminary work.

Technology  development  supporting  FutureGen  is  embodied  in
our  Fuels  and  Power  Systems  program.  The  program’s  proposed
budget  for  fiscal  year  2008,  of  $245.6  million,  will  fund  research
and  development  for  carbon  capture  and  sequestration,  membrane
technologies  for  oxygen  and  hydrogen  separation,  advanced  com-
bustion  turbines,  fuel  cells,  coal-to-hydrogen  conversion,  and  gasi-
fier-related technologies.

The  high  priority  Carbon  Sequestration  Program,  with  a  pro-
posed  budget  for  fiscal  year  2008  of  $79  million,  is  developing  a
portfolio  of  technologies  with  great  potential  to  reduce  greenhouse
gas  emissions.  The  goal  is  to  achieve  substantial  market  penetra-
tion  after  2012.  In  the  long-term,  the  program  is  expected  to  con-
tribute  significantly  to  the  President’s  goal  of  developing  tech-
nologies to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In  addition,  the  network  of  seven  regional  carbon  sequestration
partnerships  and  the  International  Carbon  Sequestration  Leader-
ship Forum, established by DOE in 2003, will continue their impor-
tant work, including vital, diverse, geologic CO2 storage tests.

Research  and  development  carried  out  by  the  Coal-to-Hydrogen
Fuels program, funded at a proposed $10 million, will make the fu-
ture  transition  to  a  hydrogen-based  economy  possible  by  reducing
the costs and increasing the efficiency of hydrogen production from
coal.

We  have  requested  $62  million  for  fiscal  year  2008  to  continue
the important work of the Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance,
the  goal  of  which  is  to  develop  the  technology  for  low-cost  scalable
and fuel-flexible fuel cell systems.

Consistent  with  the  2006  and  2007  budget  requests,  the  Petro-
leum  Oil  Technology  and  Natural  Gas  Technologies  Research  and
Development programs are proposed to be terminated in fiscal year
2008.  However,  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  will  continue  to  carry
out  important  responsibilities  in  the  oil  and  natural  gas  sector,
such  as  management  of  the  Ultra-Deepwater  and  Unconventional
Resources Research Program mandated by the Energy Policy Act of
2005.

In addition, Fossil Energy will continue to authorize natural gas
imports and exports, collect and report data on natural gas trades,
operate  the  Rocky  Mountain  Oilfield  Testing  Center,  and  oversee
the Loan Guarantee Program for the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline.
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes
my prepared statement on our research and development activities,
and I would be happy to answer any questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Shope follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THOMAS D. SHOPE

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, it’s a pleasure for me to appear before
you  today  to  present  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy’s  (FE)  proposed  Budget  for  Fiscal
Year 2008

Fossil Energy’s $863 million budget request for Fiscal Year 2008, one of the larg-
est  FE  requests  made  by  this  Administration,  will  allow  the  Office  to  achieve  two
fundamental objectives: first, to support the President’s top priorities for energy se-
curity,  clean  air,  climate  change  and  coal  research;  and  second,  to  support  the  De-
partment of Energy’s strategic goal of protecting our national and economic security
by  promoting  a  diverse  supply  and  delivery  of  reliable,  affordable,  and  environ-
mentally-sound energy.

More specifically, the proposed budget emphasizes early initiation of an expansion
of  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve;  rapid  development  of  technologies  to  manage
and  dramatically  reduce  atmospheric  emissions  of  the  greenhouse  gas  carbon  diox-
ide from fossil fuel use in power generation and other industrial activity; and design
and  other  preparatory  work  on  the  FutureGen  project  to  combine  in  one  plant  the
production of electric power and hydrogen fuel from coal with near-zero atmospheric
emissions.
THE PRESIDENT’S COAL RESEARCH INITIATIVE

I  will  begin  the  detailed  presentation  of  our  proposed  budget  with  coal,  our  most
abundant  and  lowest  cost  domestic  fossil  fuel.  Coal  today  accounts  for  nearly  one-
quarter  of  all  the  energy—and  about  half  the  electricity—consumed  in  the  United
States.  Because  coal  is  so  important  to  our  energy  future,  our  proposed  budget  of
$448 million for the President’s Coal Research Initiative, related fuel cell R&D and
R&D by federal employees within program direction accounts for more than half our
total budget.

I should mention here that our FY 2008 Budget focuses our research and develop-
ment on activities that support the President’s Advanced Energy Initiative and key
provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. These activities will be conducted large-
ly  through  cost  sharing  and  industry  collaboration.  As  a  result  of  the  evaluations
under the Research and Development Investment Criteria, and the Program Assess-
ment Rating Tool, activities throughout the program emphasize research and devel-
opment for technologies that will be used in the FutureGen project.

The goal of the overall coal program, which includes the President’s Coal Research
Initiative, is to conduct research and development that will improve the competitive-
ness  of  domestic  coal  in  future  energy  markets.  The  Administration  strongly  sup-
ports coal as an important component of our energy portfolio. This year’s budget re-
quest  completes  the  President’s  commitment  to  invest  $2  billion  on  clean  coal  re-
search over 10 years, three years ahead of schedule. Our coal budget request is bro-
ken down into the following components.
CLEAN COAL POWER INITIATIVE

We  are  requesting  $73  million  in  Fiscal  Year  2008  for  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Ini-
tiative (CCPI), a cooperative, cost-shared program between the Government and in-
dustry  to  demonstrate  emerging  technologies  in  coal-based  power  generation  so  as
to  help  accelerate  commercialization.  CCPI  allows  the  Nation’s  power  generators,
equipment  manufacturers  and  coal  producers  to  help  identify  the  most  critical  bar-
riers to coal use in the power sector. Technologies to eliminate the barriers are then
selected  with  the  goal  of  accelerating  development  and  deployment  of  applications
that  will  economically  meet  environmental  standards  while  increasing  plant  effi-
ciency and reliability. Work on promising technologies selected in two prior solicita-
tions will continue in Fiscal Year 2008, and we plan to announce a third solicitation
during the year, which will focus on advanced technology systems that capture car-
bon dioxide for sequestration and beneficial reuse.

Some  activities  of  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  will  help  drive  down  the  costs
of  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  (IGCC)  systems  and  other  technologies
for  near-zero  atmospheric  emission  plants  that  are  essential  to  the  FutureGen  con-
cept.
FUTUREGEN

FutureGen  is  a  high-priority  project  that  will  establish  the  capability  and  feasi-
bility of co-producing electricity and hydrogen from coal with near-zero atmospheric
emissions  including  carbon  dioxide.  FutureGen  is  a  public/private  partnership  de-
signed  to  integrate  technologies  that  ultimately  will  lead  to  new  classes  of  plants
that  feature  fuel  flexibility,  multi-product  output,  electrical  efficiencies  of  over  60
percent,  and  near-zero  atmospheric  emissions.  FutureGen’s  goals  include  electricity
at  costs  no  more  than  10  percent  above  power  from  comparable  plants  that  are  in-
capable of carbon sequestration. The capture and permanent storage of atmospheric
carbon  emissions  is  a  key  feature  of  the  FutureGen  concept,  as  is  the  capability  to
use  coal,  biomass,  or  petroleum  coke.  The  project  should  help  retain  the  strategic
value of coal—the Nation’s most abundant and lowest cost domestic energy resource.
FutureGen’s  proposed  budget  of  $108  million  for  Fiscal  Year  2008  will  be  used  to
support  detailed  plant  design  and  procurement,  as  well  as  ongoing  permitting,  pre-
liminary design and site characterization work.

To help fund both the CCPI and FutureGen projects in Fiscal Year 2008, our pro-
posed  Budget  redirects  $58  million  in  unexpended  sums  and  $257  million  in  de-
ferred appropriations from the original Clean Coal Technology program. Specifically,
the  Budget  proposes  to  transfer  $108  million  of  the  $257  million  deferral  to  the
FutureGen project, and cancel the remaining $149 million from the deferral. Of the
unobligated  balances  carried  forward  at  the  start  of  FY  2008,  $58  million  is  trans-
ferred to the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI).
FUELS AND POWER SYSTEMS

Technology  development  supporting  FutureGen  is  embodied  in  the  core  research
and  development  activity  of  the  Fuels  and  Power  Systems  program.  The  Fuels  and
Power  Systems  program’s  proposed  budget  for  Fiscal  Year  2008  is  $245.6  million.
Of this total amount, $183.6 million will fund research and development for carbon
capture and sequestration, membrane technologies for oxygen and hydrogen separa-
tion,  advanced  combustion  turbines,  coal-to-hydrogen  conversion,  and  gasifier-re-
lated technologies. The remaining balance of $62 million will support Fuel Cells.

The program breaks down as follows:

ADVANCED INTEGRATED GASIFICATION COMBINED CYCLE

With  proposed  funding  of  $50  million  for  Fiscal  Year  2008,  the  Advanced  Inte-
grated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  program  will  continue  to  concentrate  efforts  on
gas stream purification to meet quality requirements for use with fuel cells and con-
version processes, on impurity tolerant hydrogen separation, on elevating process ef-
ficiency,  and  on  reducing  the  costs  and  energy  requirements  for  oxygen  production
through  development  of  advanced  technologies  such  as  air  separation  membranes.

60

ADVANCED TURBINES

A  funding  request  of  $22  million  will  allow  the  Advanced  Turbines  program  to
continue its concentration on the creation of a turbine-technology base that will per-
mit  the  design  of  near-zero  atmospheric  emission  IGCC  plants  and  a  class  of
FutureGen-descended  plants  with  carbon  capture  and  sequestration.  This  research
emphasizes  technology  for  high-efficiency  hydrogen  and  syngas  turbines  and  builds
on  prior  successes  in  the  Natural  Gas-based  Advanced  Turbine  Systems  Program.
ADVANCED RESEARCH

The  Advanced  Research  program  bridges  basic  and  applied  research  to  help  re-
duce  the  costs  of  advanced  coal  and  power  systems  while  improving  efficiency  and
environmental  performance.  The  proposed  $22.5  million  budget  for  Advanced  Re-
search will fund projects aimed at a greater understanding of the physical, chemical,
biological and thermo-dynamic barriers that currently limit the use of coal and other
fossil fuels.
CARBON SEQUESTRATION

The  Carbon  Sequestration  program,  with  a  proposed  budget  for  Fiscal  Year  2008
of $79 million, is developing a portfolio of technologies with great potential to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. This high-priority program’s primary concentration is on
dramatically lowering the cost and energy requirements of pre-and post-combustion
carbon  dioxide  capture.  The  goal  is  to  have  a  technology  portfolio  by  2012  for  safe,
cost-effective and long-term carbon mitigation, management and storage, which will
lead to substantial market penetration after 2012. In the long-term, the program is
expected to contribute significantly to the President’s goal of developing technologies
to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The  Carbon  Sequestration  program’s  activities  in  Fiscal  Year  2008  will  con-
centrate on research and development projects for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and
storage, as well as measurement, monitoring and verification technologies and proc-
esses.

In  coordination  with  the  current  partnerships,  the  program  will  determine  the
‘‘highest  potential’’  opportunities  for  the  initial  expedited  round  of  large  scale  se-
questration  tests  in  saline,  coal,  and/or  oil  and  gas  bearing  formations.  This  work
will  begin  with  a  physical  characterization  of  the  surface  and  subsurface,  reservoir
modeling, and NEPA review.

The  Partnerships  will  also  move  on  to  the  next  phase  of  the  Weyburn  project,
where CO2 is being injected into a producing oil field. Weyburn’s success would de-
liver both decreased carbon emissions and increased domestic oil production.

Finally,  DOE  formed  the  international  Carbon  Sequestration  Leadership  Forum
(CSLF) in 2003 to work with foreign partners on joint carbon sequestration projects,
and to collect and share information. That work will in continue in FY 2008.

Several  members  of  the  CSLF  have  also  signed  on  to  the  FutureGen  project,  and
others  have  signaled  strong  interest  in  joining.  FUELS  Research  and  development
carried  out  by  the  Coal-to-Hydrogen  Fuels  program,  funded  at  a  proposed  $10  mil-
lion, will make the future transition to a hydrogen-based economy possible by reduc-
ing  the  costs  and  increasing  the  efficiency  of  hydrogen  production  from  coal.  This
program is an important component of both the President’s Hydrogen Fuel Initiative
and the FutureGen project.
FUEL CELLS

Within Fuel Cells, we have requested $62 million for Fiscal Year 2008 to continue
the important work of the Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance, the goal of which
is  to  develop  the  technology  for  low-cost,  scalable  and  fuel  flexible  fuel  cell  systems
that  can  operate  in  central,  coal-based  power  systems  as  well  as  in  other  electric
utility (both central and distributed), industrial, and commercial/residential applica-
tions.
RESEARCH BY FEDERAL STAFF

In  addition  to  the  funding  levels  reflected  for  Fuels  and  Power  Systems,  there  is
$20  million  provided  within  the  Program  Direction  account  that  directly  supports
the  President’s  Coal  Research  Initiative,  plus  $1  million  for  fuel  cells.  This  funding
supports  federal  staff  directly  associated  with  conducting  the  research  activities  of
specific Fuels and Power Systems subprograms.
PETROLUEM AND NATURAL GAS TECHNOLOGIES

Consistent  with  the  FY  2006  and  FY  2007  Budget  Requests,  the  Petroleum—Oil
Technology  and  Natural  Gas  Technologies  research  and  development  programs  will
be terminated in FY 2008.

61

The Oil and Gas group will manage the Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Re-
sources  Research  Program  mandated  by  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005.  However,  I
should point out that the 2008 Budget proposes to repeal this legislation, consistent
with the FY 2007 Budget Request.

In addition, FE will continue to authorize natural gas imports and exports, collect
and  report  data  on  natural  gas  trade,  and  operate  the  Rocky  Mountain  Oil  Field
Testing Center.

FE will also oversee the loan guarantee program for the Alaska Natural Gas Pipe-

line.
STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) exists to ensure America’s readiness to re-
spond  to  severe  energy  supply  disruptions.  The  Reserve  reached  its  highest  inven-
tory level—700 million barrels of oil—in 2005 the Energy Policy Act of 2005 directs
DOE  to  fill  the  SPR  to  its  authorized  one  billion  barrel  capacity,  as  expeditiously
as  practicable.  Additionally,  in  the  2008  Budget,  the  President  proposed  expanding
the Reserve’s capacity to 1.5 billion barrels.

Our  budget  request  of  $332  million  for  Fiscal  Year  2008—almost  double  last
year’s  request—will  fund  the  Reserve’s  continued  readiness  through  a  comprehen-
sive program of systems maintenance, exercises, and tests, as well as beginning ex-
pansion  to  one  billion  barrels  at  existing  and  new  sites  and  NEPA  work  to  expand
to  1.5  billion  barrels.  DOE  will  begin  immediately  to  fill  the  reserve  to  its  current
capacity  of  727  million  barrels  through  purchases  of  oil  with  available  balances  as
well  as  through  placement  of  the  Department  of  the  Interior’s  royalty  in-kind  oil
into the SPR.
NORTHEAST HOME HEATING OIL RESERVE

The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve was established in July 2000 when the
President directed the Department of Energy to establish a reserve capable of assur-
ing  home  heating  oil  supplies  for  the  Northeast  states  during  times  of  very  low  in-
ventories  and  significant  threats  to  immediate  supply.  The  Reserve  contains  two
million  barrels  of  heating  oil  stored  at  commercial  terminals  in  the  Northeast  and
is  in  good  condition.  The  current  five-year  storage  contracts  expire  in  September
2007. A request for bids was issued in February 2007. The proposed FY 2008 budget
requests $5.3 million for continued operations.
NAVAL PETROLEUM AND OIL SHALE RESERVE

The Fiscal Year 2008 budget request of $17.3 million for the Naval Petroleum and
Oil Shale Reserve (NPOSR) will allow it to continue environmental remediation ac-
tivities  and  determine  the  equity  finalization  of  Naval  Petroleum  Reserve  1  (NPR–
1);  operate  NPR–3  until  its  economic  limit  is  reached,  and  while  operating  NPR–
3, maintain the Rocky Mountain Oil Field Test Center.

Because  the  NPOSR  no  longer  served  the  national  defense  purpose  envisioned  in
the  early  1900s,  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  1996  required  the
sale of the Government’s interest in Naval Petroleum Reserve 1 (NPR–1). To comply
with this requirement, the Elk Hills field in California was sold to Occidental Petro-
leum  Corporation  in  1998.  Subsequently,  the  Department  transferred  two  of  the
Naval Oil Shale Reserves (NOSR–1 and NOSR–3), both in Colorado, to the Depart-
ment of the Interior’s (DOI) Bureau of Land Management. In January 2000, the De-
partment  returned  the  NOSR–2  site  to  the  Northern  Ute  Indian  Tribe.  The  Energy
Policy  Act  of  2005  transferred  administrative  jurisdiction  and  environmental  reme-
diation  of  Naval  Petroleum  Reserve  2  (NPR–2)  in  California  to  the  Department  of
the  Interior.  DOE  retains  the  Naval  Petroleum  Reserve  3  (NPR–3)  in  Wyoming
(Teapot Dome field).
ELK HILLS SCHOOL LANDS FUND

The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1996 authorized the settlement of
longstanding ‘‘school lands’’ claims to certain lands by the State of California known
as  the  Elk  Hills  Reserve.  The  settlement  agreement  between  DOE  and  California,
dated October 11, 1996, provides for payment, subject to appropriation, of nine per-
cent  of  the  net  sales  proceeds  generated  from  the  divestment  of  the  Government’s
interest  in  the  Elk  Hills  Reserve.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Act,  a  contingency  fund
containing  nine  percent  of  the  net  proceeds  of  the  sale  was  established  in  the  U.S.
Treasury and was reserved for payment to California.

To  date,  DOE  has  paid  $300  million  to  the  State  of  California.  The  first  install-
ment payment of the settlement agreement was appropriated in FY 1999. While no
appropriation  was  provided  in  FY  2000,  the  Act  provided  an  advance  appropriation
of $36 million that became available in FY 2001 (second installment). The next four
installments  of  $36  million  were  paid  at  the  beginning  of  FY  2002,  FY  2003,  FY

62

2004, and FY 2005 respectively. A seventh payment of $84 million was made in FY
2006.

The  Fiscal  Year  2008  budget  proposes  no  funding  for  the  Elk  Hills  School  Lands
Fund.  The  timing  and  levels  of  any  future  budget  requests  are  dependent  on  the
schedule and results of the equity finalization process.
FOSSIL  ENERGY’S  BUDGET  MEETS  THE  NATION’S  CRITICAL  ENERGY

NEEDS

In  conclusion,  I’d  like  to  emphasize  that  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy’s  programs
are designed to promote the cost-effective development of energy systems and prac-
tices that will provide current and future generations with energy that is clean, effi-
cient, reasonably priced, and reliable. Our focus is on supporting the President’s top
priorities  for  energy  security,  clean  air,  climate  change,  and  coal  research.  By  re-
evaluating, refining and refocusing our programs and funding the most cost-effective
and  beneficial  projects,  the  Fiscal  Year  2008  budget  submission  meets  the  Nation’s
critical needs for energy, environmental and national security.

Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared state-

ment. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have at this time.

BIOGRAPHY FOR THOMAS D. SHOPE

Thomas  D.  Shope  is  Chief  of  Staff  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy,  Office  of
Fossil Energy. The Office of Fossil Energy is charged with conducting technology re-
search,  development  and  demonstration  programs  that  will  ensure  that  the  United
States  can  continue  to  rely  on  clean,  affordable  energy  from  our  traditional  fuel  re-
sources.  Specific  responsibilities  within  Mr.  Shope’s  purview  include  the  manage-
ment  of  the  Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve;  oil  and  natural  gas  research  and  policy;
and the President’s $2 billion Coal Research Initiative, which includes the $950 mil-
lion FutureGen Program, to create a prototype zero-emissions coal fired power plant.
In his position, Mr. Shope serves as the principal advisor to Assistant Secretary Jef-
frey D. Jarrett.

In  July  of  2002,  Shope  began  his  tour  of  duty  in  Washington,  DC,  serving  as  the
Chief of Staff for the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Rec-
lamation and Enforcement. Shope served as OSM’s liaison to Secretary Gale Norton
and  her  senior  staff  within  the  Department  of  the  Interior.  Mr.  Shope  guided  and
directed the operations of the OSM in fulfilling its role of regulating active coal min-
ing operations as well reclaiming old abandoned mine lands. Mr. Shope played a key
role in the efforts to reform and reauthorize the Abandoned Mine Land program and
in  OSM’s  significant  enhancement  of  its  technology  transfer  activities  to  State  and
tribal regulatory authorities and other stakeholders.

A  native  of  Munhall,  Pennsylvania,  Shope  received  his  B.S.  degree  in  Economics
at  West  Virginia  University  in  Morgantown,  WV.  He  then  earned  his  J.D.  degree
from Duquesne University School of Law in Pittsburgh. After working with the Alle-
gheny  County  District  Attorney’s  Office  and  the  Pittsburgh  law  firm  of  Friedman
&  Friedman,  Shope  joined  the  Department  of  the  Interior  in  February  of  1991  as
an  Attorney  Advisor  in  the  Solicitor’s  Office.  During  his  tenure  with  the  Solicitor’s
Office,  Shope’s  practice  centered  on  various  mining  and  environmental  issues.  Mr.
Shope  was  extensively  involved  in  the  Department’s  Trusteeship  in  Natural  Re-
source  Damage  Assessment  and  Restoration  matters,  where  he  served  as  the  case
attorney on various prominent projects including the Nation’s largest Superfund re-
lated  project,  the  Tri-State  Mining  District  of  Missouri,  Kansas  and  Oklahoma.
Throughout  his  career,  Shope  has  been  recognized  for  his  ability  to  maintain  and
promote  sensitive  relations  with  Congress,  State  and  tribal  governments,  industry
and environmental groups.

DISCUSSION

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Shope.
At this point, we will open our first round of questions, and I am
going  to  recognize  myself  for  five  minutes,  but  I  will  yield  to  the
Chairman of the Science Committee, Mr. Gordon.

THE GLOBAL NUCLEAR ENERGY PARTNERSHIP (GNEP)

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  This  is  a  very

good panel, and this is very informative.

Dr.  Orbach,  you  are  the  only  member  of  the  panel  I  have  had  a
chance  to  work  with,  and  I  want  to  say  that  I  am  impressed  with
your  enthusiasm  and  knowledge  of  the  job,  and  I  look  forward  to
working with you.

Mr.  Spurgeon,  I  have  talked  with  a  variety  of  folks  inside  and
outside  the  nuclear  industry,  and  by  and  large,  I  get  the  feeling—
well,  I  don’t  get  the  feeling,  they  have  said  very  specifically  that
they are not happy with the GNEP program, that they feel like you
set—well, I won’t say you, but that there have been moving targets
set,  that  there  really  hasn’t  been  adequate  basic  research  done  be-
fore  the  potential  to  make  multi-billion  dollar  type  investments,
which might mean that we won’t maximize those investments, and
don’t  feel  like  there  is  enough  emphasis  being  put  on  Yucca  and
storage.

Do you feel that any of that is valid?
Mr.  SPURGEON.  Well,  obviously,  the  emphasis  on  Yucca,  there  is
nothing  in  this  program  that  does  anything  to  take  away  from  the
emphasis on Yucca Mountain. Yucca Mountain is critical to any re-
gime that we look at for nuclear energy going forward, as the ulti-
mate repository for nuclear—spent nuclear fuel.

But what we are doing with GNEP is creating a waste form, and
removing  the  long-lived  transuranic  elements  that  create  the  long-
term issue of fuel.

Chairman  GORDON.  So,  you  think  you  have  done  adequate  basic

research now?

Mr. SPURGEON. Sir, what—we have more research to do, but un-
derstand, we have been reprocessing fuel throughout the world for,
you  know,  for  30,  40  years.  There  are  active  reprocessing  plants,
recycle  facilities  in  existence  in  all  of  the  other  fuel  cycle  nations,
so the technology is something that has been commercialized. What
we  are  doing  is  taking  it  to  the  next  level,  taking  it  to  the  next
level of efficiency, and taking it to the next level of proliferation re-
sistance. In that, we are still doing research, and that is a big part
of what the budget request is all about.

Chairman  GORDON.  Good.  I  don’t  mean  to  be  discourteous.  Five
minutes  doesn’t  last  very  long,  and  I  am  going  to  be  submitting
questions  to  you  and  to  the  other  panel  members,  so  that  we  can
better  understand  what  you  are  doing,  and  better  do  our  job,  and
I hope that you will all be prompt in getting us responses.

EFFICIENCY STANDARDS CONCERNS

Mr.  Karsner,  in  your  prepared  statement,  you  acknowledge  that
the  backlog  of  equipment  efficiency  standards  and  the  test  proce-
dures that has developed over the last 12 years, with a little expla-
nation  for  why  and  how  this  backlog  has  started,  and  why  it  has
continued.  Over  the  last  12  years,  how  many  efficiency  standards
have been promulgated?

Mr.  KARSNER.  I  can  return  to  you  the  precise  number  for  the

record. I think it is under ten over the last 12 years.

Chairman GORDON. What about one?
Mr. KARSNER. Okay.
Chairman  GORDON.  Does  that  sound  about  right?  The  Central

Air Conditioning and Heat Pumps, maybe one out of sixteen.

Mr.  KARSNER.  My  impression  was  that  there  were  more  than  a

single standard that had been promulgated, but I——

Chairman  GORDON.  Do  you  have  staff  or  anyone  here  that  could

help you with that?

Mr.  KARSNER.  We  don’t  have  the  number  for  the  last  12  years.
Chairman GORDON. Okay.
Mr. KARSNER. We will have to report back for the record.
[The information follows:]

due?

Chairman  GORDON.  Okay.  It  is  my  understanding  it  is  one.  So,

how many more does that leave you to have to promulgate?

Mr. KARSNER. We have submitted a schedule to Congress to pro-
mulgate  up  to  17  over  the  next  five  years,  and  that  should  deal
with both the backlog and the Energy Policy Act requirements.

Chairman  GORDON.  Now,  in  that  aren’t  you  already  well  over-

Mr.  KARSNER.  There  was  recently  a  GAO  report  published  that
said we were overdue on every one of the standards for the 34 that
had  been  prescribed  for  the  last  30  years.  So  the  Department  has
acknowledged  that  particular  problem,  submitted  a  schedule  to
deal  with  that  backlog,  and  since  that  schedule  was  sent  to  Con-
gress  last  year,  we  have  been  100  percent  on  time  for  every  dead-
line that we have submitted.

Chairman  GORDON.  Mr.  Karsner,  I  am  sure  you  already  know
this. You know, even without being sworn in, it is a felony to mis-

lead  or  not  tell  the  truth  to  a  Congressional  committee,  so  let  me
just ask you, have you felt any pressure, in the short time you have
been  there,  not  to  move  forward  and  promulgate  these  rules  in  an
expeditious way?

Mr.  KARSNER.  I  have  felt  the  opposite  pressure.  It  is  a  top  line
priority of Secretary Bodman, and it is a top line priority of my Of-
fice,  and  we  will  continue  that  pressure  to  meet  those  deadlines
and——

Chairman GORDON. Has OMB slowed you down any on this?
Mr.  KARSNER.  There  is  a  procedure  to  go  through  concurrence.
The process is very time-intensive, and therefore, we have recently
submitted  legislation  to  the  Hill  so  that  we  could  shrink  and  col-
lapse  the  critical  path,  particularly  where  we  can  cultivate  con-
sensus.

Chairman  GORDON.  So,  you  are  being  told  full  speed  ahead,  do

it as quickly as you can. Is that correct?

Mr. KARSNER. And we are being given the highest priority atten-
tion  that  the—that  this  program  can  have  by  both  the  Secretary
and the Office of General Counsel.

Chairman  GORDON.  Yet  in  12  years,  you  have  only  promulgated

one rule, you are behind by statute in all the others.

Mr. KARSNER. Yes.
Chairman  GORDON.  And  I  think  the  Energy  Policy  Act  directed
the  Department  to  meet  statutory  timelines,  you  are  behind  in
those, too, aren’t you?

Mr. KARSNER. With all due respect, sir, it is obvious the Depart-
ment is behind, not just 12 years, 30 years. So something systemic
is  problematic  through  multiple  generations  and  Administrations,
and we are seeking to fix that.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  we  hope  you  can.  It  is  important  for
the  country,  and  I  will  also  be  submitting  some  questions  for  you.

How is my time? No, no, no. I don’t want to——
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Go  ahead  and  finish,  and  we  will  start  the

clock over when I start mine.

Chairman  GORDON.  No,  that  is  okay.  If  I  am  over  my  five  min-

utes, then I will——

Chairman LAMPSON. You are not. Please go ahead.

BIOENERGY RESEARCH CENTERS

Chairman  GORDON.  Okay.  Dr.  Orbach,  I  am  interested  in  the
Bioenergy  Research  Centers,  which  I  think  are  important,  and  I
am glad you have moved forward with, but it is sort of a new area
for  you.  It  is  going  from  research  to  actual  implementation  there.
And you are talking about bringing in private investors. I would
like  to  learn  a  little  more  about  that.  You  know,  what  kind  of
stakes  are  they  going  to  get  in  this,  what  kind  of  return  are  they
going  to  get  for  their  investment,  and  if  it  doesn’t  work  out,  what
is going to happen with these Centers afterwards?

Dr.  ORBACH.  We  are  currently  actually  evaluating  the  proposals
that  have  come  in,  which  indeed  have  included  the  private  sector.
We have given them a five year commitment for $25 million a year,
and  the  understanding  that  we  have  is  that  after  the  five  years,
we  will  assess  whether  they  have  been  successful.  It  is  a  new  con-
cept—you  are  quite  right—for  us,  and  so,  we  are  looking  both  at

procedures  at  effectiveness,  and  whether  we  can  deliver  on  the  in-
vestment.

That  is  the  reason  why  we  want  the  private  sector  involved.  We

want this to get to market.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  I  think  it  is  a  type  of  experiment  that
we need to be making, and as I said earlier, you seem to be on top
of your game, and I hope this will be successful.

Thank you for joining us today.
Dr. ORBACH. Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  At  this  time,  in
the spirit of fairness, I think I will recognize the Ranking Member
on the Full Science Committee, Mr. Hall.
Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And  to  Mr.  Shope,  I  don’t  have  my—I  can’t  see  that  far.  I  wish

you would bring that table a little closer to us, if you would.

Mr.  Shope,  I  have  some  questions  that  I  need  to  ask  you,  sir.  I
want  to  talk  to  you  about—do  you  know  what  I  am  about  to  ask
you about?

Mr. SHOPE. I am anxiously awaiting.

THE ULTRA-DEEPWATER AND UNCONVENTIONAL ONSHORE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

Mr.  HALL.  The  ultra-deep  provision  that  I  put  in  the  last  four
budgets, I put it in four times as a Democrat, and Republicans ac-
cepted it. This last time, I put it in as a Republican, and the Demo-
crats  accepted  it.  We  have  passed  it  and  sent  it  to  the  President.
He  signed  it,  and  now,  there  is  a  move  on  to  take  it  out  of  the
budget,  and  to  take  it  out  of  the  budget,  you  have  to  have  a  bill
go through here, and I love the President. I would absolutely jump
in the fire for him, but every now and then, I don’t agree with him,
and I think he is wrong in trying to move the ultra-deep legislation
and  take  it  off  the  books,  because  it  doesn’t  cost  anything,  it  is
going  to  get  reserves  that  are  known  there.  It  involves  technology
from  schools  and  universities.  It  is  more  of  a  research  bill  that  it
is  an  energy  bill,  but  it  pays  for  itself  in  known  quantities  of  en-
ergy  that  are  there.  We  just  can’t  get  them  up,  but  we  are  going
to  get  the  technology  to  get  some  up.  It  doesn’t  cost  anybody  any-
thing.  It  is  not  a  gift  to  Exxon  or  the  big  people,  because  they  are
not  the  ones  that  really  look  for  it,  and  they  can  buy  their  own
technology  if  they  want  to.  Independents  can’t,  but  independents
will do most of this work.

And it is just a win-win deal, and I have not been able to impress
anybody  over  the  White  House  with  that  situation,  but  everybody
else I know pretty well agrees with me.

Now,  I  guess  what  I  want  to  ask  you,  and  I  know  your  budget
calls for the repeal of the Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional On-
shore  Research  and  Development  Program,  and  that  is,  I  think,  is
the President’s request, and maybe, the gentleman that he got from
OMB,  that  is  there  advising  him.  And  wonderful  guys,  admire
them,  respect  them  both,  but—and  I  don’t  hate  the  sinners,  I  just
hate  their  sin  on  this  type  thing,  that  is  a  quote  from  Billy
Graham,  it  is  a  pretty  good,  all  old  guys  are  good  to  quote,  you
know.

I  want  to  ask  you,  though,  and  EI  assessment  of  EPAct  con-
cluded  that  this  was  one  of  only  a  few  that  would  increase  supply
and pay for itself through increased royalties. I just don’t know any
way  to  better,  it  is  going  to  get  over  $1  billion  more  in  12  years
than we have to spend for it, and we get maybe 70 years of energy
out  of  it.  I  cannot  understand  why  anybody  would  want  to  repeal
this.

They sent it, to of all people, Ed Markey, to repeal it, about three
months ago or four months ago or five months ago. Democrats and
Republicans alike gathered together and killed that bill, cleared off
a place and killed it right there on the floor about four months ago.
I  hope  we  are  going  to  do  the  same  thing  this  time,  and  I  don’t
think  we  will  have  a  lot  of  repercussions  from  over  there,  but  I
just,  you  know,  it  pays  for  itself,  and  until  that  happens,  it  is  the
law of the land, and it is to be funded on a yearly basis.

Can you please tell me what the status of that funding is at this

Mr. SHOPE. Yes, Congressman. And I appreciate and understand

time?

your comments.

There  is  a  difference  of  opinion,  however,  from  the  Administra-
tion,  as  to  whether  there  are  adequate  incentives  for  the  industry
to  do  this  research  on  its  own,  and  there  are  costs  associated,  in
the sense of foregone revenues, that will be going towards the pro-
gram.

So,  we  have  submitted  legislation  to  repeal  that  provision  of
EPAct  once  again  this  year.  That  being  said,  we  fully  intend  to
comply  with  the  law  as  it  exists,  and  that  currently  includes  oper-
ation  of  this  program.  We  did  issue  the  contract  to  RPSEA  last
year  in  December.  We  have  established  the  advisory  committees,
the  two  advisory  committees  that  are  required.  Members  are  now
being  appointed  to  these  committees,  and  the  program  is  moving
forward with all due diligence and full force, until it is repealed by
this body.

Mr. HALL. Please convey to George Herbert Bush’s son that I am
trying  to  help  him,  you  know,  like  the  little  Scout  helped  the  lady
across  the  street,  but  she  didn’t  want  to  go  across  the  street,  but
I  am  trying  to  help  him  here,  and  trying  to  get  a  supply  of  energy
that  might  keep  our  children,  your  kids  and  your  grandkids  from
having  to  fight  a  war,  because  this  country  will  fight  for  energy,
and we don’t have to. We have it right here, if we could just reach
out there and get it.

I  want  to  read,  and  I  am  not  being  a  smart-aleck  with  you  or
anything,  but  Section  99H.  Funding,  Oil  and  Gas  Lease  Income,
you  are  familiar  with  that  section,  aren’t  you?  I  think  there  are
seven  places  in  there  where  it  uses  the  word,  and  we  have  put  it
in  here  this  way,  and  used  the  word  ‘‘shall,’’  not  ‘‘may,’’  or  direct
that we prefer that they do that. It says, ‘‘and after distribution of
any such funds as described in subsection (c), $50,000,000 shall be
deposited  in  the  Ultra-Deepwater  and  Unconventional  Natural
Gas.’’ You know where that is.

Mr. SHOPE. Yes, sir.
Mr.  HALL.  A  little  bit  on  down  there  later,  it  says  ‘‘under  this
part  without  fiscal  year  limitation,  to  remain  available  until  ex-
pended.’’ Even on the next page, it says, in section (d) under Alloca-

time, sir.

tion,  from  the  federal  ‘‘Fund  under  subsection  (a)(1)  in  each  fiscal
year shall be allocated as follows.’’ Later, it says ‘‘32.5 percent shall
be  for  activities  under  section  999A.’’  A  little  later,  ‘‘7.5  percent
shall  be  for  activities  under  section’’—it  is  not  ‘‘may’’  or  precatory
words,  or  we  hope  you  will.  It  says  ‘‘shall,’’  and  I  think  we  are
going  to  defeat  the  bill  that  he  has  sent  over  here.  It  doesn’t  give
me  any  pleasure  to  do  that.  It  is  painful  for  me  to  have  to  try  to
do  that,  but  I  think  we  are  going  to  be  able  to  do  it,  and  maybe
we  get  underway  with  this,  and  I  would  like  to  work  with  you  in
working  this  out,  because  it  might  prevent  a  whole  generation  of
youngsters from having to get on a troopship and go take some en-
ergy  away  from  someone  when  we  have  got  plenty  right  here  at
home that is clean.

Thank you, sir. I respect you and I appreciate it. I yield back my

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  now  yield  my-
self  five  minutes,  and  I  want  to  continue  that  same  line,  if  I  may.
I  don’t  mean  to  be  piling  on  either,  but  RPSEA  happens  to  be  in
my Congressional district, and it is something that is important to
an awful lot of folks there, and I join Mr. Hall.

When  he  first  introduced  that  legislation  many  years  ago,  and
also  the  work  to  continue  the  effort  now,  because  we  do  recognize
that it is an important piece of legislation.
Mr. HALL. I am even glad you are back.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much. I am too.
And  obviously,  the  President  thought  that  it  was  important,  be-
cause he did sign it into law, and that is where I wonder about the
difference of opinion.

We did receive a letter from the Department and proposed legis-
lation  last  week,  asking  that  this  section  of  the  law  be  rescinded,
and given the enormous hydrocarbon resources in these fields, it is
foolish. So, what reasons does the Department have for eliminating
the Ultra-Deep program, especially in light of its elimination of oil
and gas research?

Mr. SHOPE. Congressman, the Administration believes that there
are  adequate  incentives,  particularly  with  the  current  price  of  oil,
for industry to invest in this research and development.

While  there  certainly  is  a  recognition  about  independent  opera-
tors, it is always a concern that they don’t have the ability to spend
these types of dollars. The service industry that supports them cer-
tainly does, and the Administration believes that when you have to
look at the total availability of dollars, as to where our highest pri-
ority work needs to be done with taxpayer funded dollars, this pro-
gram,  certainly,  there  are  other  incentives  to  have  that  work  ac-
complished, aside from using taxpayer dollars to do it.

Chairman LAMPSON. So, it is the belief that there is an adequate
research  being  done  by  those  companies  now.  If  Congress  doesn’t
rescind  this  law,  and  I  don’t  expect  it  is  to  do  that,  you  made  the
comment, and let me ask again, will the Department carry out this
research as it is instructed to do so by law?

Mr.  SHOPE.  Let  me  be  perfectly  clear,  Congressman.  We  abso-
lutely  will  do  that.  We  are  currently  doing  it,  as  I  mentioned.  We
are fully supportive——

69

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Then  can  you  tell  me  why  OMB  is  holding

up the money?

Mr.  SHOPE.  The  money?  Well,  right  now,  the  RPSEA  contract
is—money  is  starting  to  flow  soon,  so  we  have  the  plan  that  is  in
action, RPSEA is preparing the plan for review.

Chairman LAMPSON. Is it the Administration’s position that it is
complying  with  the  law,  then,  fully,  right  now,  the  OMB  has  re-
leased all the money it is supposed to have?

Mr. SHOPE. It has released adequate funds to begin that process.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  It  hasn’t  released  the  funds  that  the  law  is
saying that it should. The Administration proposes to cancel out oil
and  gas  research,  and  apparently,  the  reasoning  that  this  R&D,
with the reasoning that it can be done by industry alone, yet given
the cost of oil and gas research, only the biggest oil companies can
afford  to  do  this  research,  and  deploy  the  newest  technologies  in
the most technically challenging fields, so how can smaller firms le-
verage federal resources for oil and gas research?

Mr. SHOPE. Congressman, again, we believe that for independent
operators,  particularly  the  service  industries  that  provide  those
services to not only the independents but larger firms as well, will
be able to provide adequate investment, and continue research and
development.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Can  you  elaborate  on  areas  where  industry

maybe isn’t currently conducting research, or——

Mr.  SHOPE.  I  don’t—no  particular—no  particulars  are  coming  to

mind right now, Congressman. Of course, we——

Chairman LAMPSON. Any real industry effort to explore methane

hydrates that you are aware of?

Mr. SHOPE. There are international efforts that are ongoing with
respect to methane hydrates. The Department has funded some re-
search  in  the  past,  and  that  research  will  be  coming  to  a  conclu-
sion,  and  the  information  that  we  will  be  able  to  yield  from  that
research will further the research and development of hydrates.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  hope  that  you  will  convey  the  emphasis
that  at  least  Mr.  Hall  and  I  have  placed  on  this.  We  think  that  it
is  something  that  is  important.  I  personally  am  disappointed  with
the  manner  in  which  it  has  been  handled  at  this  point,  and  cer-
tainly would like to see things change, and change very quickly.

And at this point, I will recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Ing-

lis, for his questions.

THE AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS INITIATIVE

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Orbach,  the—as  I  recall,  the  Congress  made  a  commitment
to  doubling  funding  within  ten  years.  Is  that  right?  And  I  am  try-
ing to figure out where we are on that schedule.

Several  years  ago,  and  I  wonder,  and  this  is  a  seven  percent  in-
crease,  something  tells  me  if  it  were  gradual  over  that  time,  it
would  have  to  be  a  10  percent  increase  in  order  to  hit  the  ten
years,  but—doubling  within  ten  years.  Where  are  we  with  that
commitment?

Dr.  ORBACH.  The  President’s  commitment  to  double  the  funding
for the physical sciences is on track. The President’s request for ’07

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

We are——

was  a  14  percent  increase,  and  then,  a  trajectory  out  to  doubling.
And  so,  the  President’s  request  for  ’08  represents  that  trajectory.

Mr. INGLIS. So, you think we can get there.
And  the  Congress  made  a  commitment,  too.  Not  while  I  was

here, but——

Dr. ORBACH. There was, to my knowledge, the Congress and the
for  the  National  Science

President  signed  an  authorization 
Foundation——

Mr. INGLIS. Right.
Dr. ORBACH.—to double its budget. The President’s initiative, the
American  Competitiveness  Initiative,  focuses  on  the  physical
sciences,  which  includes  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  Of-
fice of Science, and also, the core research in NIST.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Right.  So,  you  are  content  that  we  are  on  schedule.

Dr. ORBACH. Yes, I am.
Mr. INGLIS. Could always use more, I suppose, but for instance—

I won’t make you answer that.

But now, let us see, the—now, Mr. Karsner spoke of the $1.2 bil-
lion, same sort of question. The President’s Hydrogen Initiative, we
are  on  track  there?  We  are—have  we  actually  appropriated  all  of
the $1.2 billion, or where do we stand on that?

Mr.  KARSNER.  This  would  be  the  year  that  we  would  fulfill  the

$1.2 billion, and we are on track.

Mr.  INGLIS.  So,  the  President’s  budget  request  would  put  us  on

track.

Mr. KARSNER. Correct.
Mr.  INGLIS.  The  question  is  whether  we  follow  through  here  in

the House to deliver on that.

Mr. KARSNER. That is correct, sir.
Mr.  INGLIS.  The  $1.2  billion.  And  of  course,  here  is  hoping  that
that  is  not  the  end  of  the  initiative,  right?  We  are  not  going  to  be
content at $1.2 billion? In other words, we have got to get, we have
got to break through, I suppose, as the——

Mr.  KARSNER.  I  wouldn’t—it  is  the  end  of  the  initiative,  the  five
year, $1.2 billion, but it is clearly not the end of the hydrogen pro-
gram,  and  its  robust  future,  that  we  expect  it  to  continue  growing
to meet its technological readiness milestones, which are necessary
over the next decade.

Mr. INGLIS. Right. Helpful.

NUCLEAR POWER

Mr.  Spurgeon,  what  is—what  holds  us  back  from  nuclear  power,

really pursuing nuclear power in this country?

Mr.  SPURGEON.  Well,  I  think  we  are  doing  it  at  this  point.  The
Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  was  a  major  breakthrough,  relative  to
starting  to  eliminate  some  of  the  barriers  that  have  been  standing
in the way of having new nuclear power.

There  has  been  an  uncertainty  of  the  regulatory  process  here-
tofore,  and  when  you  are  talking  about  major  $3  to  $4  billion  in-
vestments,  you  have  got  to  have  pretty  good  certainty  that  if  you
start down this path and try to finance this kind of a project, that
you  are,  in  fact,  going  to  be  able  to  get  a  license  to  construct  and
eventually operate the facility.

So,  the  Standby  Support  Provision  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act  is
very  important  in  that.  That  is  basically  an  insurance  policy  that
protects the sponsor against regulatory and/or litigation delays.

New  reactor  types,  standardization,  is  something  that  we  have
needed  in  this  industry.  That  is  something  that  we  now  do  have,
and  we  are  supporting.  What  the  Department  is  being  is  really  a
catalyst for leveraging our public money to encourage private activ-
ity  in  the  nuclear  arena.  So,  we  have  been  operating  under  the
2010 program as a 50/50 cost-share.

So  we  are  supporting  the  first  plants  through  the  regulatory
process.  We  are  also  supporting  the—both  from  a  standardization,
but from the early site permit standpoint, we are trying to get the,
some  of  the  environmental  issues  off  the  table  before  the  major
commitments for funds are made.

And then, finally, the last piece of this puzzle is to provide, even-
tually,  nuclear  energy  is  authorized  to  be  part  of  the  loan  guar-
antee program that would go forward, which looks for ways to then
allow plants to be financed, perhaps with a greater degree of debt,
as  opposed  to  equity,  which  lowers  the  cost  to  the  consumer  sub-
stantially, for the cost of bus bar electric power.

So, we have the tools now, and those tools are working. We have
some 30 new nuclear plants that are in one stage or another of con-
sideration, many of them in your region.

Mr. INGLIS. Yes, sir. Yeah.
Mr.  SPURGEON.  And  we  look  forward  to  the  first  applications  for

a new nuclear plant this fall.

Mr. INGLIS. Okay. Thank you, sir.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. McNerney. Recognized for five minutes.

ENERGY STORAGE

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to congratulate the board. Your testimony has been inter-
esting and informative, and I understand the difficulty of producing
a budget under these constraints. I have some questions though.

Mr.  Kolevar,  I  heard  both  you  and  Dr.  Orbach  refer  to  the  need
for  energy  storage,  for  superconductors,  and  for  the  distribution  of
electric  power,  but  your  budget  shows  an  eight  percent  decrease.
Now, I clearly understand the need for a good distribution system,
both in terms of reliability, as we have seen in the Northeast a cou-
ple  of  times  in  the  last  decade,  but  also  in  terms  of  distributing
wind  energy  and  solar  energy  that  are  intermittent  sources.  So,
how can you reconcile a decrease in the budget with the increasing
need for research and development in that area?

And  also,  is  there  any  plan  for  construction  of  distribution  sys-
tems  incorporating  this  new  technology,  or  is  this  still  a  paper  ex-
ercise?

Mr. KOLEVAR. Congressman, the decrease in the fiscal year 2008
budget is reflected in other programmatic activities, particularly in
the  High  Temperature  Superconductivity  program.  In  the  Energy
Storage  program,  in  that  activity  within  the  Office,  the  fiscal  year
2008  budget  proposes  a  doubling  of  resources.  As  I  mentioned  in
the testimony for pursuing both large-scale utility size applications
and  then  smaller  R&D  applications  that  would  benefit  principally
distributed energy systems and distributed electrical systems.

We do see these technologies in use today in limited applications.
There is a lot more work that needs to be done. The Office of Elec-
tricity Delivery and the Office of Science collaborate on storage ac-
tivities. Generally speaking, while we partner on these, you will see
the  line  drawn  with  respect  to  the  timeframes  involved.  The  work
undertaken in Dr. Orbach’s program is consistent with his program
more of a long-term focus.

The work that we have done in the Office of Electricity Delivery
has  been  really  to  demonstrate  now  the  feasibility  of  storage  pro-
grams,  test  them  into  the  system,  validate  their  capability,  con-
tinue  to  support  those  applications  to  increase  the  feasibility  of
these  applications.  And  having  pushed  a  couple  of  these  out  in
demonstration  programs  over  the  last  two  years,  I  expect  that  the
program  will  spend  more  time  on  research  and  development,  with
an eye toward rolling out some newer energy storage systems, such
as flow batteries, in the next seven to ten years.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  So,  is  that  consistent  with  the  decrease  in  the

sistent with the increase proposed by the President for these activi-
ties, a little over a doubling of the moneys involved.

budget?

GEOTHERMAL ENERGY RESEARCH

Mr. MCNERNEY. Okay. I am going to move on.
Mr.  Karsner,  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  zeroing  out  of  the
geothermal  studies  and  research.  My  understanding  is  that  there
is  a  report  from  the  MIT  that  shows  up  to  25  percent  of  our  na-
tion’s electrical energy can be produced from geothermal sources in
the  United  States,  and  this  would  form  a  baseline,  as  opposed  to
some other forms of renewable energy.

So, what is the justification for zeroing out that part, or that re-

search area?

Mr.  KARSNER.  Well,  the  study  that  you  refer  to  specifically,  the
Tester study on enhanced geothermal systems, obviously wasn’t out
or  taken  into  account  when  this  budget  was  formulated  in  excess
of 20 months ago, but—so to comment further on that, the historic
and conventional geothermal technology that has been the focus of
the  program,  as  a  legacy  of  a  program,  is  not  applied  to  the  en-
hanced geothermal systems potential identified in that study.

It  really  amounts  to  about  15  gigawatts  of  energy  nationwide.
That  15  gigawatts  is  being  right  now  very  proactively  exploited  in
the  marketplace,  very  profitably  by  participants  in  the  market-
place,  largely  based  on  Energy  Policy  Act  provisions  in  policy  that
induced  greater  development  and  exploitation  of  the  convention
geothermal.

We  will  not  foreclose  on  the  possibility  of  emerging  technologies,
and we are reviewing the results of that study, to see if it is worthy
of integrating into future considerations.

Mr. MCNERNEY. How is my time, Mr. Chairman?
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  Mr.  Bartlett  from

Maryland, five minutes.

ETHANOL POTENTIAL AND SUSTAINABILITY

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much.  Five  minutes,  five  panel-

ists, thank you very much for cooperating with short answers.

I might note, Dr. Orbach, that seven percent exponential growth,

does double in ten years, so you are on target.

We  are  producing  enough  ethanol  to  make  a  minimal  contribu-
tion  to  reducing  our  dependence  on  gasoline,  but  it  has  had  an
enormous  effect  on  corn  prices.  They  have  doubled  from  $2.11  in
September to $4.08 in December. Tortillas are increased in price in
Mexico, and they aren’t able to buy as many, and my dairymen are
dying because of these high prices.

Who  is  looking  at  the  potential  in  your  bioengineering  research
and  sustainability?  Is  that  your  responsibility  or  somebody  else’s?

Dr. ORBACH. It is the Department’s responsibility, and we——
Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  would  just  encourage  you  to  look  at  potential
and  sustainability,  because  you  know,  the  fact  that  you  can  do  it
doesn’t  mean  that  you  are  going  to  have  enormous  amounts  of  en-
ergy in the future. We still have to eat, and you know, that is going
to compete with the need for these, for this energy production.

MORE ON NUCLEAR POWER

Mr.  Spurgeon,  how  many  years  do  we  have  to  operate  a  nuclear
power  plant  to  get  back  the  fossil  fuel  energy  it  took  to  build  it?

Mr. SPURGEON. I don’t have that number——
Mr.  BARTLETT.  If  you  don’t  have  that  number  at  your

Mr.  BARTLETT.  I  get  wildly  divergent  numbers  as  to  how  long
that  takes,  and  I  would  like  to  have  it  from  the  experts,  what  it
really is.

Mr. SPURGEON. Be glad to give it to you, sir.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you. Thank you very much.

POWER PLANT SITING

Are you looking at siting future power plants in populated areas,
so  that  we  can  use  the  excess  heat  for  district  heating  and  with
ammonia  cycle  cooling  for  refrigeration  in  the  summertime,  rather
than  rather  stupidly  siting  them  where  we  have  to  use  drinking
water and cooling towers to dissipate precious energy?

Mr. SPURGEON. Most of the new plants that are being considered
today  are  located,  or  designed  to  be  located,  or  planned  to  be  lo-
cated,  I  should  say,  at  the  site  of  existing  reactor  facilities.  Most
of  our  reactor  sites  were  originally  designed  to  accommodate  more
units  than  currently  exist  on  those  sites.  So,  this  will  be  the  first
steps——

Mr. BARTLETT. I hope that when we are really siting new plants,
that  we  look  at  putting  them  where  people  live.  By  the  way,  if  I
sleep  four  feet  from  the  nuclear  power  plant  in  one  of  our  sub-
marines, I have less radiation than if I am laying out on the beach.
And we really need to be siting these in populated areas, so we can
use  the  district  heat.  It  is  really  pretty  dumb  to  use  drinking
water,  evaporate  drinking  water  to  dissipate  heat  that  we  des-
perately need in a world that is going to be increasingly energy de-
ficient.

ENERGY CONSERVATION

Mr.  Karsner,  I  had  the  privilege  of  leading  a  nine  Member  dele-
gation  to  China  just  over  the  break  at  Christmas  and  New  Year’s.
I  celebrated  New  Year’s  in  China.  And  they  began  their  conversa-
tion  on  energy  by  talking  about  post-oil.  They  seem  to  get  it.  We
are  having  trouble  getting  it.  And  they  have  a  five  point  program,
the  first  point  of  which  is  conservation.  You  didn’t  mention  that.
Is  conservation  included  in  your  efficiency,  or  who  has  responsi-
bility for promoting conservation in our country?

Mr.  KARSNER.  Well  conservation  and  efficiency,  of  course,  are
very  closely  linked.  Conservation,  getting  less  from  less,  efficiency,
getting  more  from  less.  And  but  the  idea  is  using  less  in  both  in-
stances.

So,  we  do  have  a  responsibility.  Our  Office  was  formerly  named
the  Office  of  Conservation,  before  it  was  changed  to  the  Office  of
Efficiency.

Mr. BARTLETT. Good. Well, you know, conservation is two people
riding  in  the  car.  Efficiency  is  using  a  Prius  rather  than  an  SUV.
So,  they  are  different,  but  both  of  them  have  the  same  goal,  that
is, using less energy, and still live comfortably.

ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PULSE (EMP) PREPAREDNESS

Mr.  Kolevar,  you  are  responsible  for  energy  distribution.  How
much  energy  will  you  be  able  to  distribute  after  a  robust  EMP
laydown? And I note there was an article just a couple of days ago
about the threat from China and EMP laydown. Sir, is the answer
none?

Mr. KOLEVAR. The answer would be zero electrical energy.
Mr. BARTLETT. You are correct, sir. And I would submit that this
ought to be a very high priority. A single weapon that made it 300
miles high over the center of our country would shut down all elec-
tric productivity for the foreseeable future. Am I not correct?

Mr. KOLEVAR. I do not dispute that. I don’t know those numbers

specifically, but the impact would be dramatic.

Mr. BARTLETT. Yes. Thank you very much.

POTENTIAL COAL SUPPLY

Mr. Shope, you mentioned coal. We have 250 years of coal. If you
just increase, use two percent, which we will have to do better than
that,  that  shrinks  to  85  years.  If  you  use  some  of  that  energy  to
convert  the  coal  into  a  liquid  or  a  gas,  you  have  now  shrunk  to  50
years,  and  since  energy  is  now  fungible,  and  it  moves  on  a  world
market,  if  we  share  our  50  years  of  coal,  just  two  percent  increase
with  the  world,  that  shrinks  it  to  12.5  years.  That  is  not  much,  is
it?

Mr. SHOPE. I am not sure I understand your question, Congress-

man.

coal.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Well,  you  know,  we  brag  we  have  250  years  of

Mr. SHOPE. Right.
Mr. BARTLETT. So, then, don’t worry about energy for the future.
But if you increase its use only two percent, that 250 years shrinks
to 85 years. And since you can’t fill your chunk of the car with coal

76

and go down the road, you are going to have to convert it to a liq-
uid or a gas. Now—and if you use the energy to do that from coal,
you  are  now  down  to  about  50  years,  and  since  all  energy  today
moves  on  a  global  marketplace,  and  we  are  going  to  share  that  50
years of coal with the world, now it shrinks, four into 50, it is 12.5.
So, now we are down to 12.5 years.

That  doesn’t  leave  me  very  sanguine  that  coal  is  going  to  solve

our energy future. Am I wrong?

Mr.  SHOPE.  Well,  Congressman,  of  course,  with  respect  to  coal,
that  is  one  of  the  main  things  we  are  working  on,  is  making  it
more efficient, the use of it more efficient, and that is what our pro-
gram  is  geared  towards,  is  to  get  more  energy  out  of  the  coal  re-
serves we have, and we do have ample coal supplies in the United
States. I think——

Mr.  BARTLETT.  You  think  12.5  years  at  only  two  percent  growth

is ample, okay? I am not sure it is ample.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.
I  am  apologizing  to  all  of  our  Members  for  the  timeliness  of  this,
because  of  this  joint  session  that  is  about  to  start,  we  are  going  to
try to rush through these as quickly as we can.

I will call next on Mr. Lipinski.

THE INTERNATIONAL LINEAR COLLIDER

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  would  appreciate  if
the panel members could answer some written questions that I am
going to submit.

Right  now,  I  just  want  to  raise  three  issues.  The  last  one  is  the
only  one  I  will  ask  a  question  on,  but  I  just  wanted  to  first  say,
to  Mr.  Shope,  I  am  concerned  that  the  $79  million  is  not  enough
for  carbon  sequestration,  and  I  just  want  to  raise  that  issue,  and
follow up with some questions on that.

Mr. Karsner, I just wanted to mention that Representative Inglis
and I have reintroduced our H Prize Act this year, to authorize the
Secretary  of  Energy  to  establish  monetary  prizes  for  technological
advancement  in  hydrogen  energy.  I  think  it  is  a  smart  way  to  go
about  doing  it.  I  am  happy  to  see  that  there  is  a  significant  in-
crease in hydrogen research also in the budget this year.

But the thing I really wanted to talk about and ask the question
is to Dr. Orbach. And I want to thank you and the Department for
advocating  for  the  International  Linear  Collider,  specifically  hous-
ing it there at Fermilab in Illinois. I think this can bring great ben-
efits,  and  it  is  very  significant  for  the  United  States  to  be  able  to
house  this  collider  in  the  United  States.  I  have  spoken  with  Con-
gressman  Hastert  on  this  issue.  Fermilab  is  located  in  his  district.
I talked to Dr. Oddone, who is the Director at Fermilab. Could you
elaborate  a  little  bit,  briefly,  on  the  progress  of  bringing  ILC  to
Fermilab, and the significance for our country of doing that?

Dr.  ORBACH.  Well,  it  will  be  very  significant  if  we  can  bring  it
here.  What  we  are  doing  in  our  ’08  budget  is  doubling  the  amount
of  funds  for  R&D  for  the  superconducting  cavities  and  the  other
elements  that  would  go  into  the  International  Linear  Collider.  We
are  in  the  process  of  developing  an  international  agreement,  or  an
international  relationship  that  would  enable  us  to  correlate  our

R&D with the research and development in Asia and in Europe, so
that we can make it truly international.

We  are  just  beginning  to  work  out  the  details  of  that,  and  we
hope  that  that  will  lead  in  a  few  years  to  the  availability  of  the
building blocks for the International Linear Collider.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you. I will yield back.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Lipinski,  and
now, I will recognize Ms. Biggert, the former Chairman of our sub-
committee.

MORE ON THE GLOBAL NUCLEAR ENERGY PARTNERSHIP

(GNEP)

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have  got  a  couple

questions I hope I can get in.

Mr.  Spurgeon,  you  know,  I  have  said  many  times  before  that  I
support  the  vision  of  GNEP,  namely,  to  develop  and  deploy  tech-
nologies,  reduce  the  volume  and  toxicity  of  nuclear  waste  by  recy-
cling  and  maximizing  the  energy  extracted  from  our  uranium  sup-
plies.

I  am  concerned,  and  I  am  not  convinced  that  the  Department  is
proceeding in a way that really is going to build public or Congres-
sional  support  for  this  important  program,  and  that  really  does
worry  me.  As  you  know,  I  would  be  a  lot  more  comfortable  with
DOE’s  plans  if  the  Department  had  completed  a  comprehensive
systems analysis.

And  I  know  that  you  mentioned  in  your  testimony  that  you  are
working  on  a  systems  analysis,  on  a  variety  of  deployments  sys-
tems  alternatives.  And  you  are  conducting  a  program  environ-
mental  assessment,  I  know,  because  there  was  one  that  was  held
in Joliet right near my district.

So,  why  can’t  the  DOE  conduct  a  similar  programmatic  systems
analysis  to  help  build  support  for  the  vision  of  GNEP,  and  why  do
you  still  believe  that  the  commercial  scale  demonstration  is  the
best way to proceed, rather than the engineering scale demo, espe-
cially since there hasn’t been a comprehensive systems analysis?

And  I  know  that,  you  know,  there  was  a  cut  in  the  budget  last
year  by  the  Appropriations  Committee,  because  there  hadn’t  been
this  analysis,  and  we  just  have  to  get  going.  It  really  concerns  me
that you say, what, 15 years before we are going to be set, and you
know,  I  think  this  is  so  crucial  to  our  energy  demands,  and  to  re-
duce our dependence on foreign oil.

Mr.  SPURGEON.  I  agree  with  you,  ma’am.  We  do  need  to  get
going,  and  that  is  the  whole  point  of  the  program.  We  are  con-
ducting  a  comprehensive  systems  analysis.  Some  of  the  decisions
are relative to precise scale, will be an outcome of that. We are pro-
ceeding  with  the  generic  environmental  impact  statement,  pro-
grammatic  environmental  impact  statement,  in  order  to  move  the
process  forward,  and  we  are  engaging  industry,  because  there  is  a
great deal of worldwide expertise in this arena.

So,  we  are  underway  with  cooperative  programs  currently,  with
Russia,  with  France,  with  Japan,  and  we  intend  to  exploit  the
worldwide  knowledge  in  this  area,  in  order  to  leverage  our  own
program,  to  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  technology  that  does
exist,  so  we  don’t  have  to  reinvent  all  of  the  wheels  here  locally.

about——

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Well,  I  guess  we  need  that,  since  we  are  25  years

Mr. SPURGEON. Yes, sir. Yes, ma’am. We certainly do.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  But  you  still  haven’t  answered  my  question,

Mr. SPURGEON. In terms of the scale?
Ms. BIGGERT. Yes.
Mr. SPURGEON. We believe that there are many pieces that need
to  be  demonstrated  yet,  and  that  is  what  the  R&D  program  is  all
about,  associated  with  this  program.  There  are  pieces  that  need  to
be demonstrated at the prototypic or demonstration scale, and that
is  what  we  intend  with  part  of  this  budget.  And  tests  that  will
demonstrate the entire process.

There are other pieces of the program. Because they are so simi-
lar  to  existing  facilities,  like  some  that  I  know  you  have  visited,
that  are  ready  for  commercial  scale  deployment.  Now,  the  precise
capacity  will  be  determined  as  a  result  of  our  this  year’s  evalua-
tion, and the systems analysis. It can, though, be built, these facili-
ties can be built in a modular fashion that allows us to get started
and expand to commercial scale as we go.

So,  that  is  your—the  conclusion  is  not  reached.  The  intent  is  to

move it as fast as we can, consistent with good science.

THE RARE ISOTOPE BEAM

Ms.  BIGGERT.  All  right.  I  just  want  to  thank  Dr.  Orbach  for  the
ACI.  I  think  you  and  Dr.  Bodman  have  really  pursued  that,  and
the research and physical sciences, and thank you so much.

I can’t leave this hearing without asking you about RIA or RIA–
Lite.  I  know  that  it  is  still  in  the  President’s  budget.  If  you  could
just tell me the status of that.

Dr. ORBACH. We will be, in fiscal year 2008, having a competition
for the design of what we now call the Rare Isotope Beam, and that
design competition will be the same as the siting. That is, whoever
proposes the best design, that is where it will be built.

We  have,  in—when  you  receive  the  outyear  budgets,  when  they
go  to  Congress,  you  will  find  PED  money  in  the  out  years  for  the
beginning the process, but the design right now is in a competitive
situation, and that is what we are pursuing.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you. Ms. Giffords.

SOLAR ENERGY

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  Karsner,  briefly.  I  was  pleased  to  see  the  President’s  ’08
budget when it came to solar. I believe there is about an 81 percent
increase, $148 million. Coming from Arizona, a state with an abun-
dance of sunshine, it is certainly very good news.

I  am  curious  about  the  President’s  initiative.  I  am  curious  if  it
is on track, the obstacles that possibly you are facing, and whether
or  not  by  2015,  we  are  truly  going  to  have  photovoltaic  cells  that
are  competitive  with  other  types  of  power.  So,  if  you  could  please
address that, I would appreciate that.

Mr.  KARSNER.  I  believe  it  is  not  only  on  track.  I  believe  it  holds
great  potential  for  getting  ahead  of  that  2015  timetable,  particu-
larly in places with—where we can unlock solar resources like Ari-
zona  and  the  Southwest,  not  just  through  photovoltaics,  but  you
might  note  that  we  have  also  increased  funding  for  concentrated
solar  power,  which  can  increase  base  load  generation,  and  shape
the  power,  in  collaboration  with  the  expected  results  from  storage
capacity that we expect from Dr. Orbach’s efforts.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman LAMPSON. All done? Thank you very much.
Well, I want to thank everyone, and as we bring this meeting to
a  close,  particularly  each  and  every  one  of  our  witnesses  for  testi-
fying before the Subcommittee. I think it has been a very informa-
tional hearing for everyone here, and our witnesses have given this
committee a better understanding of DOE’s plans and priorities for
the coming year.

If there is no objection, the record will remain open for additional
statements  from  the  Members,  and  for  answers  to  any  of  the  fol-
low-up  questions  that  the  Committee  may  ask  of  the  witnesses.
Without objection, so ordered.

This hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Raymond  L.  Orbach,  Under  Secretary  for  Science,  U.S.  Department  of

Energy

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. This  Committee  is  concerned  about  future  of  U.S.  high  energy  physics  and  the
prospects for siting the International Linear Collider on U.S. soil. While it is of
paramount  importance  that  the  U.S.  maintain  its  global  leadership  in  this  and
many  other  scientific  fields,  Congress  will  undoubtedly  exercise  extreme  caution
in moving forward with the development of facilities that may cost the taxpayers
billions.  We  need  only  look  back  as  far  as  the  Superconducting  Super  Collider
to see the pitfalls that must be avoided as the ILC concept ripens.

Q1a. Where  does  the  ILC  currently  rank  in  the  Department’s  priorities  of  proposed

projects and facilities?

A1a. The  Office  of  Science  Facilities  for  the  Future  of  Science,  A  Twenty  Year  Out-
look  report,  issued  in  November  2003,  ranked  the  International  Linear  Collider
(ILC) as the top priority in the mid-term category.
Q1b. What is DOE’S timeline for development of the ILC, and how does this compare

to the timeline laid out by the research community?

A1b. The  Department  of  Energy’s  Order  413.3A  provides  a  rigorous  series  of  mile-
stones, known as Critical Decisions, to provide checks and balances and controls for
the  management  of  construction  projects.  The  Office  of  Science’s  success  in  man-
aging  large  construction  projects  like  the  Spallation  Neutron  Source  has  stemmed
from  rigorous  observance  of  these  milestones,  enforced  by  intensive  use  of  both  in-
ternal  and  external  reviews.  The  Critical  Decisions  process  is  among  our  key  tools
for  determining  the  readiness  of  construction  projects,  correctly  costing  and  sched-
uling  the  projects,  and  keeping  them  on  time  and  within  budget.  The  Office  of
Science takes the requirements of Order 413.3A very seriously.

Briefly, the major milestones are as follows: Critical Decision–0—Approve Mission
Need,  Critical  Decision–1—Approve  Alternative  Selection  and  Cost  Range,  Critical
Decision–2—Approve  Performance  Baseline,  Critical  Decision–3—Approve  Start  of
Construction, and Critical Decision–4—Approve Start of Operation of Project.

Every construction project must meet requirements for approval of Mission Need,
Alternative  Selection  and  Cost  Range,  and  Performance  Baseline  before  a  start  of
construction can be approved.

The  ILC  has  not  yet  passed  the  Critical  Decision–0  (CD–0)  milestone—that  is,
Mission Need for the ILC has not yet been established. The Department is at a very
early  stage  in  this  project  planning.  Several  requirements  must  be  met  before  CD–
0/Mission  Need  can  be  determined.  Among  them  is  an  assessment  of  the  scientific
opportunities  potentially  represented  by  the  ILC.  This  assessment  will  await  anal-
ysis  of  early  physics  results  from  the  Large  Hadron  Collider,  which  are  now  ex-
pected about 2010–2011. The technical feasibility of core technologies will also have
to be demonstrated.

The  Global  Design  Group  (GDE),  a  self-organized  group  drawn  from  the  inter-
national  research  community  for  the  ILC,  issued  its  Reference  Design  Report  in
February  2007.  This  report  includes  the  desired  scientific  scope  of  the  project  and
a very early stage cost estimate using international methodology and assuming that
construction would occur from 2012 to 2019.

A  decision  to  go  forward  with  the  ILC  is  not  imminent.  Even  assuming  an  even-
tual positive decision to build an ILC, its schedule will almost certainly be lengthier
than  the  GDE  assumptions.  Completing  the  R&D  and  engineering  design,  negoti-
ating  an  international  structure,  selecting  a  site,  obtaining  firm  financial  commit-
ments, and building the machine could take us well into the mid-2020s, if not later.
Q1c. What are the current preliminary cost estimates for the ILC?
A1c. We do not yet have a preliminary cost estimate for the ILC that has been com-
missioned,  reviewed,  and  validated  by  the  Department.  The  Global  Design  Effort
(GDE), a self-organized group drawn from the international research community for
the ILC, issued a ‘‘Reference Design Report’’ in February 2007. This report includes
a  very  early  stage  cost  estimate  based  on  international  methodology  which  is,  how-
ever,  very  different  from  that  used  by  DOE  in  costing  projects.  For  example,  the
GDE  estimate  does  not  include  cost  for  detectors  at  the  facility,  construction  esca-
lation or inflation, contingency, engineering design, or a number of other costs that
DOE  incorporates  into  Total  Project  Cost.  While  the  GDE  Report  is  helpful  in  pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

83

viding the basic outlines of the scientific scope and initial design parameters of the
project,  it  does  not  provide  sufficient  information  on  such  key  elements  as  proof  of
core technology to allow a reliable cost estimate at this time.
Q1d. Will  the  Department  take  steps  to  record  the  history  of  the  failed  SSC  project

and develop from that a ‘‘Lessons Learned’’ document?

A1d. There  have  been  a  number  of  ‘‘lessons  learned’’  reports  on  the  Super-
conducting  Super  Collider  (SSC)  and  other  large-scale  science  projects.  The  Office
of  Science  is  well  aware  of  the  lessons  from  the  SSC  experience  and  has  identified
five areas that need very close attention for any such new project. These five areas
include: establishing a fully international basis for the project from the start; secur-
ing the broad support of the wider scientific community for the project; establishing
agreed  upon  practices  for  costing,  including  how  to  handle  issues  like  project
changes  and  escalation;  and  establishing  clear  and  strong  management  structures
with well defined reporting lines. The fifth area is close attention to any larger na-
tional  or  international  events  that  might  impact  project  costs  or  alliances.  These
‘‘lessons  learned’’  will  be  carefully  applied  in  developing  the  global  ILC  R&D  effort.
Q1e. What steps have been taken to educate Congress and the public on the relevance

of Elementary Particle Physics, and the ILC specifically?

A1e. The  call  for  better  public  outreach  on  the  goals  of  particle  physics  in  general
and the ILC specifically has been clearly made by Congress and others. The Depart-
ment has funded a number of publications in this area.

A  notable  contribution  to  informed  public  discussion  is  the  2006  National  Re-
search  Council  (NRC)  report  Revealing  the  Hidden  Nature  of  Space  and  Time:
Charting  the  Course  for  Elementary  Particle  Physics  (also  sometimes  known  as  the
‘‘EPP  2010  Report’’).  The  report  discusses  the  reasons  in  layman’s  language  for
maintaining  U.S.  leadership  in  elementary  particle  physics,  explains  the  scientific
opportunities potentially represented by an ILC, and recommends U.S. investments
in R&D for the ILC.

In addition, several initiatives by the elementary particle physics community have

improved and expanded public communication over the past few years.

Symmetry  Magazine  (http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/)  was  founded  in
2004  and  presents  a  broad,  human  account  of  the  aspirations  and  achievements  of
high energy physics.

The  Quantum  Universe  report  (http://www.interactions.org/quantumuniverse/
qu/)  is  an  exciting  and  readable  account  of  the  dramatic  new  questions  facing  the
field.  Its  sequel,  Discovering  the  Quantum  Universe  (http://www.interactions.org/
quantumuniverse/qu2006/),  lays  out  the  exciting  opportunities  to  be  addressed  by
the  ILC  and  the  ILC’s  relationship  to  the  Large  Hadron  Collider  soon  to  begin  at
CERN in Switzerland. The ILC Reference Design Report recently issued by the GDE
includes  a  30-page  illustrated  companion  document,  Gateway  to  the  Quantum  Uni-
verse  (http://media.linearcollider.org/ilc¥gatewayquantumuniverse¥draft.pdf),  that
explains the potential benefits of the ILC in non-technical language and outlines the
steps forward to achieve it.

In  recognition  of  the  need  to  explain  the  scientific  basis  for  the  ILC  to  a  wider
public,  the  GDE  has  set  up  a  network  of  communicators  in  the  U.S.,  Europe,  and
Asia. In addition to the Gateway document referred to above, they publish a weekly
ILC  Newsline  (http://www.linearcollider.org/cms/)  that  features  recent  news,  ad-
vances  in  the  accelerator  R&D,  and  articles  of  general  interest  relating  to  project
organization and outreach activities.
Q1f. What  steps  have  been  taken  in  the  development  of  the  ILC  plan  to  include  the
private  industries  that  will  ultimately  be  contracted  to  build  and  operate  the
ILC? Are you planning to develop an industrialization plan?

A1f. Two  years  ago,  a  not-for-profit  organization  called  the  Linear  Collider  Forum
of America (LCFOA) was formed by representatives from small and large U.S. com-
panies.  LCFOA  provides  a  formal  network  for  committed  members  to  reach  out  to
their  counterparts  across  U.S.  industry  to  educate  them  about  the  technologies
being  developed  for  the  ILC  and  the  potential  opportunities  for  new  business.
LCFOA holds two to three meetings per year and has recently hosted a symposium
and reception in the House Science Committee room to provide information and ini-
tiate a dialogue with Members of Congress and their staff.

LCFOA  is  planning  a  symposium  in  mid-May  that  will  bring  representatives  of
industry,  government,  and  the  research  community  together  to  help  identify  areas
where the accelerator technology can provide benefits that seed new industrial activ-
ity, research, and commercial applications. This symposium is organized around five
themes: the use of linear accelerators for medicine and industry; applications of the

84

superconducting  accelerating  technology;  high  power  radio  frequency  sources;
nanoscale  instrumentation;  and  detector  technologies  with  new  imaging  applica-
tions.  The  LCFOA  symposium  is  part  of  a  globally  coordinated  activity  to  develop
partnerships between industry and the research community.
Q1g. What  steps  have  been  or  will  be  taken  to  assemble  a  team  for  a  U.S.  bid  to

host the ILC?

A1g. The GDE Reference Design Report assessed the viability of sample sites in the
U.S.  (near  Fermilab),  Japan,  and  Europe.  These  sites  varied  in  detail,  but  all  were
found to be viable and of comparable cost to construct.

The Fermilab site builds upon the extensive infrastructure already in place at the
existing  laboratory.  Fermilab  is  taking  the  lead  in  developing  the  expertise  nec-
essary  to  prepare  a  bid  to  host  the  ILC,  and  has  established  a  regional  community
committee to support the ILC planning process and serve as a local outreach group
to describe the benefits and impacts an ILC could bring.
Q2a. The Office of Science funds some $800 million a year in grants. But it has been
said  that  only  one  of  ten  proposals  for  funding  to  DOE  Office  of  Science  get
funded.  Do  you  believe  this  is  the  right  proportion?  If  not,  where  should  that
proportion be in the next five years?

A2a. The  Office  of  Science  grant  funding  is  about  $600  million  per  year  primarily
to colleges and universities. These grants are awarded through open competitive so-
licitations  for  proposals.  A  rigorous  scientific  peer  review  process  is  the  standard
practice  for  the  Office  of  Science  in  order  to  ensure  the  highest  quality  research  is
funded.  The  standard  for  funding  proposals  should  be  the  quality  of  the  proposal
and not the proportion of proposals funded.

Thirty-two  percent  of  the  more  than  1,600  new  grant  proposals  received  during
FY  2005  were  funded.  Approval  rates  for  grant  renewals  of  funding  for  the  second
and third years of three-year grants and for supplemental awards were significantly
higher,  at  about  90  percent.  Combined,  about  half  of  the  proposals  received  during
FY 2005 were funded. While funding decisions for about 20 percent of the more than
1,800  new  grant  proposals  received  during  FY  2006  are  still  pending.  I  anticipate
that once all grant decisions are made, approval rates for proposals received during
FY  2006  will  be  similar  to  those  in  FY  2005.  I  believe  that  this  is  a  healthy,  com-
petitive percentage of proposals funded.
Q2b. How  do  you  balance  new  construction  versus  upgrading  of  existing  facilities

and university grant funding?

A2b. To  ensure  that  the  most  scientifically  promising  research  and  enabling  re-
search  tools  are  supported,  each  program  in  the  Office  of  Science  engages  in  long-
range planning and prioritization; regular, external, independent review of the sup-
ported research and scientific facilities to ensure quality and relevance; and evalua-
tion  of  program  performance  through  establishment  of  and  subsequent  measure-
ment against goals and objectives.

These  activities  rely  heavily  on  input  from  external  sources;  including  workshops
and  meetings  of  the  scientific  community,  advice  from  federally  chartered  advisory
committees,  intra-DOE  and  interagency  working  groups,  and  reports  from  other
groups  such  as  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences.  The  reports  and  advice  received
often  include  recommendations  on  new  scientific  opportunities  through  research  or
new  instruments  and  on  appropriate  levels  of  funding  to  develop  the  plans,  prior-
ities,  and  strategies  for  the  program  and  to  help  maintain  an  appropriate  balance
among  competing  program  elements,  from  new  construction  and  upgrades  of  exist-
ing facilities to new research initiatives and university grant funding.

Based on these inputs and other factors, including Department mission need and
Administration  priorities,  each  program  is  responsible  for  planning  and  prioritizing
all  aspects  of  supported  research  and  facilities  and  for  conducting  ongoing  assess-
ments to ensure a comprehensive and balanced portfolio.

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. The FY08 budget request proposes the development of three Bio-Energy Research
Centers  through  the  Office  of  Science.  Given  the  Office  of  Science  long-standing
role supporting basic research and the physical sciences, this could be considered
a  big  leap  into  the  realm  of  applied  energy  technology  development.  The  plan
is  to  run  these  centers  like  a  ‘‘biotech  startup’’  with  substantial  private  invest-
ment.  Private  investors  have  their  own  parameters  for  what  they  consider  to  be
a  worthwhile  investment  that  may  or  may  not  be  compatible  with  what  the  De-
partment envisions for these programs. The Committee would also like to ensure

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00088 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

85

that the centers maintain activities distinct from one another, and do not dupli-
cate existing efforts.

Q1a. Why  would  private  investors  be  compelled  to  put  their  ‘‘skin  in  the  game’’?
What  kind  of  return  on  investment  can  investors  expect  to  see  and  in  what
timeframe? Does this arrangement require negotiating unique intellectual prop-
erty contracts?

A1a. The  three  Bioenergy  Research  Centers  will  support  comprehensive,  multi-dis-
ciplinary  fundamental  research  that  is  expected  to  provide  the  scientific  foundation
for  development  of  cost-effective  biofuels  and  bioenergy  production.  The  nature  of
the  basic  research  to  be  supported  by  these  centers  is  believed  to  be  high-risk  to
the private sector. Its high potential pay-off, however, is expected to attract private
investors.  The  solicitation  for  proposals  for  the  Centers  was  announced  in  August
2006.  Proposals  were  due  February  1,  2007  and  are  currently  undergoing  peer  re-
view.  The  specific  nature  of  these  private  investments  and  the  timeframe  for  a  re-
turn  on  investment  is  not  prescribed  in  the  Funding  Opportunity  Announcement.
The  Centers  will  be  encouraged  to  explore  collaborative  opportunities  with  private
investors through the licensing of technology arising at the Centers and through en-
tering  into  a  variety  of  partnering  agreements  according  to  the  contract  provisions
that will be included in the agreement for the operation of the center.
Q1b. How would the research at these centers differ from what is conducted at other
labs and within industry? How will these centers be distinct from one another?
A1b. These  Centers  are  designed  to  fill  a  critical  void  in  the  Nation’s  efforts  to  de-
velop and deploy cost-effective, commercially viable methods for producing cellulosic
ethanol and other biofuels by focusing on basic research. Unlike industry-sponsored
research in this area, which typically aims at incremental improvements to current
technologies,  the  Centers  are  aimed  at  fundamental  breakthroughs.  Many  experts
in  this  field  believe  strongly  that,  absent  transformational  breakthroughs  in  basic
science,  it  will  be  extremely  difficult,  and  probably  impossible,  to  develop  a  viable
biofuels  economy.  Present-day  conversion  methods  are  simply  not  efficient  enough,
and  incremental  improvements  will  not  meet  the  need.  Experts  largely  agree  that
until  we  can  produce  ethanol  from  cellulose,  ethanol  will  not  be  cost-effective.  But,
breaking  down  cellulose  into  sugars  is  a  challenging  problem.  At  the  same  time,
many scientists believe that the biotechnology revolution and today’s advanced sys-
tems biology at the cutting edge hold out the promise of real solutions.

DOE  can  provide  advanced  scientific  resources  to  address  the  biofuels  challenge
which no other institution, research organization, or funding agency, private or pub-
lic, can match.

In  the  Funding  Opportunity  Announcement  the  Department  did  not  specify  any
particular  technology  focus  for  the  Bioenergy  Research  Centers.  Rather,  we  delib-
erately  requested  applicants  to  provide  their  best  scientific  roadmap.  While  we  did
put  a  certain  emphasis  on  cellulosic  ethanol  (and  liquid  transformation  fuels  gen-
erally), we largely left the research focus open. We are looking to the best scientific
minds  to  identify  the  best  approaches  and  we  will  not  know  the  specific  focus  and
approach of each Center until we have selected the three awardees.

Whatever the outcome of the solicitation, however, there are many advantages to
deploying multiple Centers. First, the existence of three Centers will create competi-
tion  in  the  race  for  real  solutions  to  our  energy  security  needs-and  experience  has
shown  competition  to  be  an  enormous  incentive  for  scientific  performance  and  re-
search  success.  Second,  multiple  Centers  will  enable  us  to  make  maximum  use  of
the  talent  available  to  address  this  problem  and,  third,  will  enable  us  to  explore
multiple avenues to a solution at the same time, thereby potentially hastening suc-
cess. And, finally, even as the Centers compete, they will also be able to learn from
one  another,  especially  as  we  facilitate  and  review  their  management  with  an  eye
to maximizing ‘‘best practices.’’
Q1c. What are the long-term prospects for these labs after their initial research goals
are  met,  or  deemed  otherwise  unattainable?  Will  they  cease  to  operate  or  con-
tinue indefinitely with DOE funding?

A1c. The  FOA  offers  no  DOE  commitment  beyond  the  initial  five-year  period  and
requests  that  the  research  program  described  in  the  application  be  limited  to  this
period.  Applicants  were  not  allowed  to  request  construction  funds  and  were  in-
structed  to  plan  for  having  the  Center  fully  operational  within  one  year  of  the
award  being  made,  so  that  completion  of  specific  short-term  objectives  could  be
made during the five years of the award.

Q1d. Please  provide  a  breakdown  of  all  the  teams  submitting  proposals  for  the  Bio-

energy Research Centers and, if possible, the current state of bid selection.

A1d. Applications for the Bioenergy Research Centers are currently undergoing sci-
entific  merit  review.  DOE  does  not  release  information  on  ongoing  financial  assist-
ance  activities,  not  even  the  identities  of  applicants.  Once  selections  are  made,  ex-
pected in summer 2007, the names of the selected applicants will be announced.
Q2a. Section  1102  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  mandates  that  the  Department
set  aside  0.3  percent  of  funds  for  research,  development,  demonstration  and
commercial  application  for  authorized  educational  activities.  It  was  intent  of
both  the  House  and  Senate  that  this  Fund  be  established  and  the  funds  in  it
be  expended  starting  in  FY  2006.  We  are  now  well  into  FY  2007  and  the  De-
partment  has  not  dedicated  funding,  has  not  been  able  to  tell  Congress  what
is  spent  on  research,  development,  demonstration,  and  commercial  applica-
tions, or what is spent on the allowable science education activities under Sec-
tion  1102  and  983  of  EPACT.  Can  we  expect  these  activities  to  be  underway
in time for teachers to receive training this summer under this program?

A2a. I  appreciate  your  interest  and  support  of  the  Department’s  contribution  to
math and science education in the U.S. We intend to reach the 0.3 percent funding
level  for  authorized  educational  activities,  if  in  fact  we  are  not  already  exceeding
that amount. We are currently in the process of determining the Department’s total
funding  for  research,  development,  demonstration,  and  commercial  applications  ac-
tivities  and  also  the  total  amount  the  Department  spends  on  education  activities.
We will provide those figures to you as soon as they are available.
Q2b. If not, what is preventing this program from moving forward?
A2b. DOE is moving forward on the authorized activities contained in Sections 1102
and 983 of the Energy Policy Act that have received appropriated funding from Con-
gress. We are in the process of establishing a plan for the development of new pro-
grams that take advantage of the Department’s unique capabilities for science edu-
cation  through  experiential  learning  opportunities.  Once  we  have  an  approved  plan
in  place  for  new  and  enhanced  programs  as  well  as  peer  reviewed  evaluation  of
those  programs,  the  Administration  will  propose  an  appropriate  funding  level  and,
if funded by Congress, programs like those envisioned in the Energy Policy Act will
move forward.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. I  understand  you  are  trying  to  balance  funding  between  facilities  and  core  re-
search,  can  you  please  explain  what  you  base  your  funding  decisions  on  and
what your plan is for the out years?

A1. The Office of Science scientific user facilities and its core research programs are
inextricably  linked.  Without  balanced  investments  in  both  facilities  and  research,
we would run the risk of limiting scientific productivity, missing windows of oppor-
tunity to advance areas of scientific research and innovation, and decreasing the Of-
fice  of  Science’s  effectiveness  in  addressing  DOE  mission  needs.  Therefore,  our
spending plan attempts to carefully balance priorities in facilities and core research
to promote a healthy and productive program.

To  help  maintain  appropriate  balance  among  competing  elements  of  program,
such  as  the  balance  of  funding  between  facilities  and  core  research  program,  each
program  in  the  Office  of  Science  engages  in  long  range  planning  and  prioritization;
regular  external  independent  reviews  of  the  supported  research  to  ensure  quality
and  relevance;  and  evaluation  of  program  performance  through  establishment  of
and  subsequent  measurement  against  goals  and  objectives.  These  activities  rely
heavily on input from external sources, including workshops and meetings of the sci-
entific  community,  advice  from  the  federally  chartered  advisory  committees,  intra-
DOE  and  interagency  working  groups,  and  reports  from  other  groups  like  the  Na-
tional  Academy  of  Sciences.  The  reports  and  advice  provided  often  include  rec-
ommendations  on  appropriate  levels  of  funding  to  develop  research  and  facility
plans, priorities, and strategies.

Each Office of Science program considers these external inputs and is responsible
for  planning  and  prioritizing  all  aspects  of  supported  research,  conducting  ongoing

tive  accomplishment  of  our  varied  and  complex  missions.  About  50  percent  of  the
users at our facilities come from universities and are funded by the Office of Science
or  other  federal  agencies.  In  the  out  years,  with  the  growth  proposed  in  the  Amer-
ican  Competitiveness  Initiative,  I  expect  to  make  substantial  progress  on  many  of
the  new  facility  and  facility  upgrade  projects  outlined  in  ‘‘Facilities  for  the  Future
of Science: A Twenty Year Outlook,’’ with the goals of maintaining at least an order-
of-magnitude lead in scientific capability over other facilities world-wide, and of op-
erating  our  suite  of  user  facilities  at  or  near  optimum  levels.  At  the  same  time,  I
also plan to grow our core research funding steadily at universities and national lab-
oratories  and  to  increase  support  for  existing  and  promising  new  research  in  areas
important  to  DOE  mission  needs  and  identified  by  advisory  groups  and  workshops
like the Basic Research Needs workshops which the Office of Science has been con-
ducting for the past several years.
Q2. What  is  the  status  of  ITER?  How  long  does  our  funding  commitment  last  for,

and when are we expecting to see results?

A2. The  seven  ITER  Parties,  including  the  United  States,  signed  the  ITER  Agree-
ment  on  November  21,  2006.  The  Agreement  provides  the  legal  framework  for  the
ITER phases of construction, operation, deactivation, and decommissioning. U.S. do-
mestic  and  international  ITER  activities  are  well  underway  to  complete  the  ITER
design  and  prepare  for  the  start  of  construction.  The  U.S.  Contributions  to  ITER
Project,  which  supports  the  construction  phase  of  ITER,  has  a  nine-year  funding
profile  with  a  cap  of  $1.122  billion.  It  is  a  Major  Item  of  Equipment  project  that
was  first  introduced  in  the  FY  2006  Budget  Request  to  Congress.  International
ITER  Project  activities  in  FY  2007  and  FY  2008  will  establish  overall  design  and
schedule baselines that may affect the U.S. Contributions to ITER Project. DOE ex-
pects  to  establish  the  cost  and  schedule  performance  baselines  for  the  U.S.  Con-
tributions to ITER Project in late FY 2008. The U.S. contributions consist of in-kind
equipment,  personnel  who  will  work  in  the  international  ITER  Organization,  and
cash for the ITER Organization central fund. The preliminary schedule for the U.S.
Contributions to ITER Project concludes in FY 2014. Afterward, the ITER Organiza-
tion  is  scheduled  to  complete  assembling  and  commissioning  the  ITER  facility  be-
tween  2014  and  2016.  It  is  anticipated  that  research  operations  at  ITER  will  begin
in about 2017 and extend over a 20-year period. Funding for decommissioning would
be furnished annually during the 20-year operation period. Deactivation would com-
mence around 2037. The funding for deactivation would be furnished during a five-
year period starting when ITER is shutdown around 2037.
Q3. What do you see as the future of the elementary particle physics program in the

United States and future of domestic facilities?

A3. Overall, the U.S. will play a leadership role in the physics of the Large Hadron
Collider  when  it  begins  producing  data  in  2008  and  in  world  leading  research  pro-
grams in neutrino physics and dark matter as well as a pivotal role in the develop-
ment of next generation accelerators through its strong program of technology R&D
for  future  accelerators.  This  research  program  will  be  carried  out  largely  through
strong collaborations involving both U.S. universities and the DOE national labora-
tories.  Office  of  Science  High  Energy  Physics  user  facilities  will  be  concentrated  at
Fermilab  after  the  Stanford  Linear  Accelerator  Center  (SLAC)  B-factory  completes
operations in 2008.

The  current  plan  is  to  continue  running  the  Fermilab  Tevatron  through  the  end
of  fiscal  year  2009.  This  is  based  on  input  from  the  Particle  Physics  Project
Prioritization  Panel  (P5),  a  sub-panel  of  the  High  Energy  Physics  Advisory  Panel,
in  December  2005.  The  schedule  for  turning  on  the  Large  Hadron  Collider  (LHC)
continues  to  evolve,  and  new  results  from  the  Tevatron  are  regularly  being  pub-
lished.  P5  will  meet  this  summer  to  consider  whether  their  recommendation  needs
to be revised on the basis of new information.

While  the  Tevatron  collider  program  will  be  completed  by  the  end  of  the  decade,
other  accelerator-based  facilities  at  Fermilab  will  continue.  In  particular,  the  accel-
erator-based  neutrino  program,  which  employs  Fermilab’s  powerful  proton  beam,
will  continue  to  be  a  world-leading  center  investigating  the  science  of  the  neutrino.
The  flagship  experiments  in  this  program,  MINOS  and  NOvA,  are  expected  to  run
well into the later part of the next decade.

As  to  the  longer-term  future,  although  we  may  eventually  be  able  to  make  a
strong scientific case for the ILC, it is premature to make that determination at this
time. While there has been some progress through initial international efforts, much
work  remains  to  be  done  before  the  U.S.  is  in  a  position  to  make  informed  evalua-
tions and decisions. Even assuming a positive decision in the future to build an ILC,
its  schedule  and  cost  will  almost  certainly  exceed  the  optimistic  projections.  Com-

pleting the R&D and engineering design, negotiating an international structure, se-
lecting a site, obtaining firm financial commitments, and building the machine could
take  us  well  into  the  mid-2020s,  if  not  later.  Within  this  context,  the  Department
has  started  to  re-engage  the  U.S.  particle  physics  community  in  a  discussion  of  the
future of particle physics by asking the question: were the ILC not to turn on until
the middle or end of the 2020s, what are the right investment choices to ensure the
vitality and continuity of the field during the next two to three decades and to maxi-
mize the potential for major discovery during this period?

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Dennis  R.  Spurgeon,  Assistant  Secretary  for  Nuclear  Energy,  U.S.  De-

partment of Energy

Questions  submitted  by  Chairman  Bart  Gordon  and  Subcommittee  Chair-

man Nick Lampson

Q1. The  Department  released  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership  (GNEP)  Stra-
tegic  Plan  this  year.  However,  neither  this  plan  nor  the  DOE  Budget  Request
provides sufficient justification for the significant increases in funding requested
for  GNEP.  The  plan  calls  for  research  and  development  of  advanced  reprocess-
ing  technologies,  commercial  deployment  of  evolutionary  reprocessing  tech-
nologies, and the commercial deployment of a fast reactor. In two years, the Sec-
retary  is  to  make  a  Record  of  Decision  regarding  the  path  forward  to  the  com-
mercializing of reprocessing and recycling. This is a pretty short period of time.
Q1a. How  does  the  Department  plan  to  spend  a  four  fold  increase  in  funding  for

GNEP in one year?

A1a. The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership
(GNEP) supports spending primarily in two areas: research and development (R&D)
involving experimentation and advanced computation and simulation ($297 million)
and, proposed facility definition and conceptual design ($92M).

The  R&D  category  includes  funding  for  university  programs  supporting  GNEP
($48.5M), continued work to improve our knowledge and confidence in advanced fuel
cycle technology, including spent fuel separations, transmutation fuel, systems anal-
ysis,  advanced  computer  simulation,  and  nuclear  and  materials  science  and  engi-
neering.

The  facility  funding  covers  laboratory-led  conceptual  design  activities  for  the  Ad-
vanced  Fuel  Cycle  Facility,  a  research  facility  to  be  located  at  a  DOE  site;  and  in-
dustry-assisted  studies  on  both  a  consolidated  fuel  treatment  center  and  an  ad-
vanced  burner  reactor.  The  remaining  $6  million  of  the  FY  2008  budget  request
from  the  Office  of  Nuclear  Energy  for  GNEP  would  go  to  support  transmutation
education and other support activities.
Q1b. What  is  the  balance  in  funding  between  the  R&D  activities  and  the  commer-

cialization activities?

A1b. The Department plans to use $45M of the FY 2008 budget request for industry
to  complete  conceptual  design  studies  of  facilities  suitable  for  commercialization;  to
document  cost,  schedule,  risk,  and  needed  technology;  and  to  develop  an  economic
analysis  that  shows  how  costs  would  be  shared  between  government  and  business.
Of  the  $297  million  requested  in  FY  2008  for  R&D  funding,  approximately  $133M
supports work to address scale up and end-to-end testing in order to move from lab-
oratory  to  commercial  scale.  This  includes  funding  to  invest  in  both  physical  and
intellectual infrastructure needed to support initiatives for closing the fuel cycle.
Q1c. In two years, industry can basically perform studies such as environmental im-
pacts for siting these facilities, designing these facilities, and economic analysis
for the facilities; how much are we going to spend on studies?

A1c. The  Department  plans  to  support  multiple  industry  studies  with  the  $45  mil-
lion  of  FY  2008  funds,  as  outlined  above.  The  ongoing  siting  studies  for  potential
locations for GNEP facilities will be completed with FY 2007 funds.
Q1d. GNEP as proposed will spend billions of dollars to develop the Advanced Burn-
er  Reactor.  Do  you  envision  that  this  reactor  would  be  a  U.S.  export  product?
is  planned  to  be  developed  to  destroy
A1d. The  advanced  burner  reactor 
transuranics  from  spent  nuclear  fuel  and  simultaneously  produce  electricity.  It  is
important to note that it is the Department’s goal that, through GNEP, that the ma-
jority of Advanced Burner Reactor costs would be funded by industry (including de-
velopment  and  construction).  The  Advanced  Burner  Reactor  could  be  produced  as
a U.S. export product to other fuel cycle states.
Q1e. Could the Advanced Burner Reactor envisioned by GNEP ever be converted to

a breeder reactor?

A1e. The Advanced Burner Reactor is currently planned to be designed and licensed
to  consume  plutonium  and  other  transuranic  elements.  As  such,  it  would  not  be
built to breed plutonium. Changing the internal configuration of such a reactor from
a  burner  to  a  breeder  configuration  would  be  difficult,  although  not  impossible.  Be-

cause  GNEP  envisions  using  this  technology  only  within  fuel  cycle  states  where
similar technology is already in place, proliferation concerns would be minimal.
Q2. Some  in  the  DOE  have  argued  that  in  order  to  lead  the  debate  on  how  nuclear
technologies are deployed worldwide, the U.S. needs to lead in all aspects of the
nuclear  fuel  cycle.  This  argument  has  some  merits,  but  the  rate  of  deployment
of nuclear technologies in the U.S. and worldwide needs to be considered. While
there is interest on the part of the nuclear industry, not one of these utilities has
actually submitted a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Q2a. What gives the DOE such confidence that the nuclear industry is going proceed
with  such  a  rapid  deployment  of  nuclear  power  plants  that  we  need  to  start
commercial  reprocessing  in  the  very  near  future,  when  the  industry  itself  has
indicated  that  a  good  estimate  of  the  rate  of  deployment  of  nuclear  power
plants will not be known until 2020 at the earliest?

A2a. Since  the  signing  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (EPAct),  it  is  our  under-
standing that the NRC has received letters of intent from 15 companies stating that
they  plan  to  submit  applications  for  combined  construction  and  operating  licenses
(COLs) for up to 33 reactors by 2008. The first COL is expected to be issued by late
2010  and  a  new  advanced  light  water  reactor  would  be  operational  by  the  2015–
2016  timeframe.  Based  on  the  success  of  EPAct  incentives  in  evoking  these  letters
of  intent  and  the  completion  of  the  final  design  tasks  through  the  Nuclear  Power
2010  projects,  we  believe  that  the  power  companies  will  have  the  confidence  they
need to begin building the next generation of new nuclear plants.
Q2b. What  indication  do  you  have  that  the  U.S.  nuclear  industry  is  committed  to

commercial reprocessing?

A2b. Several  private  sector  nuclear  industry  respondents  clearly  stated  that  they
were  interested  in  participating  in  the  development  of  domestic  commercial  reproc-
essing  facilities  in  response  to  the  Department’s  August  2006  Request  for  Expres-
sion of Interest in GNEP Facilities.
Q3. DOE  seemingly  concluded  that  fast  reactors  are  the  only  reactor  type  that  can
effectively  burn  nuclear  waste.  It  is  not  clear  that  the  Department  has  thor-
oughly examined the capability of other technology options such as the high tem-
perature gas cooled reactors.

Q3a. Can you please be specific as to how much has been spent and any documenta-
tion  that  has  supported  the  examination  of  other  waste  burning  technologies
such as high temperature gas cooled reactors?

A3a. A wide variety of fuel cycle strategies were investigated as part of the Depart-
ment’s  Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative  (AFCl)  and  predecessor  programs  with  an-
nual  funding  of  roughly  $5  million  over  the  time  period  of  2001–2006.  Approxi-
mately  $3  million  in  FY  2005  and  $2  million  in  FY  2006  was  devoted  specifically
to examining the gas cooled reactor (GCR) deep burn concept.

Extensive studies were conducted of the waste management impacts of alternative
fuel cycle strategies. A key finding of these studies was that the transuranic (TRU)
elements  (primarily  Pu,  Am,  Np,  and  Cm)  present  in  light  water  reactor  (LWR)
spent  nuclear  fuel  (SNF)  are  the  primary  contributors  to  the  waste  characteristics
that pose the greatest disposal challenges (e.g., long-term heat load, peak repository
dose, and radio toxicity). Thus, a critical goal of the Global Nuclear Energy Partner-
ship (GNEP) strategy is to exclude these materials from the waste in its final form.
In  a  closed  fuel  cycle,  the  TRU  are  separated  from  the  SNF  and  transmuted  into
fission products with more amenable waste characteristics; this process is commonly
called ‘actinide burning’.

The Department has evaluated the burning potential of existing LWRs, advanced
LWRs,  advanced  fast  reactors  (FRs),  accelerator-driven  systems,  and  the  complete
spectrum  of  Generation-IV  reactor  concepts  (including  high  temperature  gas  cooled
reactors  and  fast  reactor  alternatives).  The  key  distinguishing  feature  for  burning
potential is the neutron energy spectrum—thermal or fast.

Extensive  studies  of  multiple  recycles  in  thermal  LWRs  were  conducted  in  2001–
2005. The general conclusion was that LWRs could be utilized for the initial recycle
of  plutonium,  as  currently  employed  in  France.  However,  each  recycle  of  the  TRU
becomes  progressively  more  difficult  and  would  be  limited  by  fuel  handling  issues.
A modest heat load/radio toxicity benefit was observed for a variety of LWR recycle
strategies,  however,  a  complementary  fast  spectrum  system  would  still  be  required
to complete the burning mission and yield more significant benefits.

In summary, the burning potential of various reactor systems, including high tem-
perature  GCRs,  has  been  evaluated.  Thermal  recycle  systems  could  achieve  partial

91

burning  of  recycle  TRU,  but  would  require  a  follow-up  fast  reactor  to  complete  the
burning  mission.  GNEP  continues  to  investigate  these  mixed  (thermal/fast)  tech-
nology  options  as  alternate  deployment  strategies,  with  concurrent  development  of
a sodium-cooled fast reactor technology as the baseline approach.
Q3b. Which labs have been involved in this work?
A3b. The U.S. laboratories performing the advanced fuel cycle analyses include Ar-
gonne  National  Laboratory,  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory,  Idaho  National  Lab-
oratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratory.

The  LWR  recycle  analysis  was  conducted  in  collaboration  with  the  French  CEA
Laboratory to assure that the most recent international experience with LWR recy-
cle fuels and mixed oxide experience was reflected.

The  high  temperature  gas-cooled  thermal  reactor  fuel  cycle  analysis  was  con-
ducted  by  Argonne  National  Laboratory  and  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  in
close  collaboration  with  General  Atomics.  The  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  and
the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  have  also  been  involved  in  the  fuels  work  for  this
reactor type.
Q3c. Should more be spent on further work in this regard?
A3c. The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  GNEP  supports  continued  investigation  of
mixed  (thermal/fast)  technology  options  as  alternative  deployment  strategies.  The
extensive LWR recycle studies previously conducted were motivated by the fact that
LWRs will continue to dominate the U.S. nuclear fleet for the next several decades.
Using LWRs for a partial burning mission would require the development and dem-
onstration  of  recycle  fuels.  Furthermore,  some  modifications  to  conventional  LWRs
would be required to allow widespread application of recycle fuels. If high tempera-
ture gas-cooled reactors are deployed extensively for either process heat applications
or  electricity  production,  their  suitability  for  a  partial  burning  mission  would  also
be considered.
Q4. For reasons of balance of trade and U.S. influence on the non-proliferation front,
it  is  important  for  there  to  be  a  healthy  U.S.  owned  nuclear  industry.  As  does
DOD, DOE should consider the health of the U.S. owned nuclear industry when
making procurement decisions. There is growing concern about DOE issuing nu-
clear research and development contracts to foreign owned or based nuclear com-
panies  that  in  turn  receive  research  and  development  contracts  from  their  own
respective governments.

Q4a. Is reciprocal treatment afforded to U.S. companies?
A4a. Speaking only for the Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), the overwhelming major-
ity  of  DOE’s  Nuclear  Energy  Research  and  Development  (R&D)  funding  goes  to
American laboratories and universities. They are free to sub-contract work with for-
eign entities. NE seeks to ensure that research dollars find their way to the people
and  facilities  that  can  best  do  the  work  at  the  lowest  cost.  This  tends  to  favor  do-
mestic R&D except in cases where suitable facilities do not exist, such as fast reac-
tor  test  programs,  or  where  a  specific  expertise  or  facility  lies  outside  the  United
States.  A  special  situation  exists  in  the  Generation  IV  program,  where  U.S.  R&D
is augmented by research funded by other countries, with all participating countries
sharing the results of the research.

Developing recycling facility concepts and designs requires expertise and practical
experience  that  is  in  very  short  supply  in  the  United  States,  as  we  have  not  de-
signed  or  operated  such  facilities  on  a  commercial  scale  in  decades.  In  this  case,
DOE  may  rely  in  part  upon  foreign-owned  companies  that  are  typically  subsidized
by  their  governments.  Domestic  companies  may  participate  in  this  work  and  in  so
doing develop more domestic capability.
Q4b. What  is  your  assessment  of  the  current  state  of  the  U.S.  owned  nuclear  indus-

try?

A4b. With  the  lack  of  nuclear  plant  orders  in  the  United  States  since  1978,  there
has  been  a  consolidation  in  the  nuclear  industry,  and  many  nuclear  plant  compo-
nent  manufacturers,  suppliers,  and  construction  companies  are  no  longer  in  that
business.

Although  the  Nuclear  Steam  Supply  System  vendors,  Westinghouse  and  General
Electric,  have  continued  selling  reactors  overseas  and  servicing  the  currently  oper-
ating  reactors  worldwide,  many  U.S.  companies  have  not  been  similarly  engaged
and have not maintained their American Society of Mechanical Engineers N-stamps
(quality  assurance  programs)  which  are  needed  for  manufacturing  nuclear  plant

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

92

components.  A  large  number  of  nuclear  plant  components  will  have  to  be  procured
overseas. The prime example of this situation is that U.S. companies no longer have
the  domestic  capability  to  make  the  large  ring  forgings  needed  for  major  nuclear
components  such  as  reactor  pressure  vessels.  In  fact,  there  is  only  one  company
worldwide that can produce these forgings, The Japan Steel Works.

With announcements by 15 power companies of their intentions to submit applica-
tions  to  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  for  combined  Construction  and  Oper-
ating Licenses for as many as 33 new nuclear reactors, U.S. manufacturers are get-
ting ready to reacquire, or acquire for the first time, their N-stamps, but it will take
some  time  before  the  number  of  domestic  companies  holding  N-stamp  certification,
in the low one-hundreds today, is as high as when our current nuclear plants were
being built, just below 500.

As the market for new reactor orders solidifies and these companies retool, many
of  the  components  of  nuclear  power  plants  are  expected  to  be  built  in  the  United
States.  Until  such  manufacturing  capacity  is  expanded  domestically,  however,  com-
ponents  for  some  of  the  new  U.S.  reactor  plants,  especially  large  pressure  vessels,
steam generators, and pumps, will have to be built overseas.
Q4c. Does  NE  have  any  policy  of  giving  U.S.  owned  companies  any  preference  in

competition over R&D contracts?

A4c. Much of DOE’s research portfolio is aimed at support or stimulation of a public
interest, as opposed to buying R&D for the direct benefit of DOE, and thus is issued
as  a  financial  assistance  instrument  and  not  as  a  procurement  contract.  This  dif-
ferentiates DOE somewhat from DOD, which does R&D for the creation of weapons
systems  and  the  like  through  procurement  contracts.  More  commonly,  DOE  issues
contracts  for  the  management  and  operation  of  National  Laboratories  that  conduct
research,  or  DOE  issues  financial  assistance  instruments.  DOE’s  National  Labora-
tories  are,  of  course,  based  in  the  U.S.  and  conduct  virtually  all  of  their  operations
in  the  U.S.  We  discuss  the  statutory  policies  applicable  to  financial  assistance  in-
struments in the next section.
Q4d. Are there particular laws, regulations or policies that prevent DOE from giving

preferential treatment to U.S. owned nuclear firms in procurements?

A4d. There  are  no  laws,  regulations,  or  policies  that  explicitly  prohibit  DOE  from
giving preferential treatment to U.S. firms in procurements for nuclear research and
development  contracts.  However,  the  Competition  in  Contracting  Act  of  1984  gen-
erally  requires  that  agencies  procure  goods  and  services  using  full  and  open  com-
petition,  and  restrictions  must  be  justified  as  necessary  to  meet  the  agency’s  needs
or  as  falling  within  the  Act’s  stated  exceptions.  With  regard  to  nuclear  energy,  the
Energy  Research,  Development,  Demonstration,  and  Commercial  Application  Act  of
2005  (Title  IX  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005)  contains  two  provisions  that  re-
quires DOE, at the very least, to consider foreign participation:

• Section 952(c) of the Act mandates that DOE shall carry out a Nuclear Power
2010 Program. Specifically, Section 952(c)(2)(C) further states that the admin-
istration  of  the  program  shall  include  ‘‘participation  of  international  collabo-
rators in research, development, and design efforts, as appropriate.’’
• Section 953 of the Act, Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, mandates the conduct
of a program to evaluate proliferation-resistant fuel recycling and transmuta-
tion technologies. Section 953(c) specifically provides: ‘‘In carrying out the pro-
gram,  the  Secretary  is  encouraged  to  seek  opportunities  to  enhance  the
progress of the program through international cooperation.’’

Notably, Section 2306 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct 92), and its imple-
menting  regulations  at  10  C.F.R.  600.500  et  seq.,  required  an  affirmative  finding
that  a  financial  assistance  award  is  in  the  economic  interest  of  the  United  States,
and  a  further  finding  that  the  foreign  country  under  whose  laws  the  foreign  firm
is  organized  affords  U.S.  firms  comparable  participation  and  investment  opportuni-
ties  and  provides  adequate  protection  of  U.S.  intellectual  property  rights.  However,
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 05) does not contain any similar provision, nor
does it prescribe any blanket preference for U.S. firms for research and development
programs.  Current  DOE  programs  derive  most,  if  not  all,  of  their  direction  from
EPAct  05.  Hence,  the  requirements  of  Section  2306  of  EPAct  92  and  its  imple-
menting regulations are largely inapplicable to ongoing programs.

In  addition,  when  we  issue  a  research  and  development  financial  assistance  or
procurement  award,  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  35  U.S.C.  200  et  seq.  requires  that  small
businesses,  university,  and  non-profit  awardees  retain  ownership  of  new  inventions
subject  to  a  preference  in  any  exclusive  licensing  of  companies  who  agree  to  sub-
stantially manufacture in the United States. For awardees not subject to the Bayh-

Dole  Act,  DOE  owns  all  new  inventions  unless  a  waiver  is  granted.  In  negotiating
patent  waivers,  we  seek  to  have  provisions  that  maximize  benefit  to  the  U.S.  econ-
omy such as by seeking U.S. manufacture of any commercial exploitation of the new
inventions.
Q5. The relationship between the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) and GNEP
is  not  clear,  making  it  difficult  to  discern  a  comprehensive  nuclear  policy  from
the department.
a. Please outline the relationship between the NGNP project and GNEP?
b. Of these which is an industry priority?
c. Are you confident that U.S. companies will be willing to assume the cost-share

of NGNP?

A5. One  of  the  key  objectives  of  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership  (GNEP)  is
to  make  nuclear  power  an  attractive  alternative  to  fossil  fuels  for  developing  coun-
tries  around  the  world.  Because  the  power  generation  requirements  are  limited  for
these  countries,  they  will  likely  need  smaller  reactors.  A  Very  High  Temperature
Reactor  (VHTR),  such  as  the  one  being  developed  under  the  Next  Generation  Nu-
clear Plant (NGNP), is a small modular reactor design that could be very well suited
to meet the objectives of GNEP for global deployment of nuclear power to developing
countries.

In  the  meantime,  a  continuing  priority  of  the  Department  is  the  Nuclear  Power
2010  program  which  seeks  to  bring  new  nuclear  reactors  online  in  the  very  near
term. Domestically, NGNP is not currently considered a competitive base load elec-
trical  power  generation  technology.  Therefore,  continued  research  and  development
is  needed  before  it  is  of  greater  interest  to  the  nuclear  power  industry.  The  petro-
chemical  industry  and  other  energy  and  product  manufacturing  industries  are  the
most  likely  to  be  interested  in  NGNP  as  a  heat  source  for  energy  intensive  proc-
esses.  At  this  time,  these  industries,  while  expressing  interest,  have  not  expressed
a willingness to invest equally with the government in the licensing and deployment
of  NGNP.  They  are  interested  in  the  government’s  pursuit  of  this  technology  with
possibly  a  small  percentage  cost  share.  The  Department  remains  committed  to  the
timeframe  laid  out  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  for  development  of  the  NGNP
and is seeking to increase industry cooperation.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. You  point  out  that  45–50  1,000  megawatt  nuclear  reactors  must  be  built  over
the next 25 years to maintain nuclear’s 20 percent share of electricity generation.

Q1a. Will our current fleet last this long?
A1a. Most  of  the  existing  103  U.S.  nuclear  plants  are  expected  to  continue  oper-
ating  for  the  next  25  years.  As  of  today,  forty-eight  of  these  nuclear  reactors  have
received  license  renewals  for  an  additional  twenty  years  of  operation  with  another
eight currently under review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Should the entire fleet of currently operating nuclear plants receive only a single
twenty-year  license  renewal,  the  first  retirement  would  be  expected  in  2029.  By
2032, 12 reactors totaling 8,000 megawatts of capacity will have been retired leaving
in place 92 of the original 104 reactors with 94,000 megawatts of capacity. The rate
of  reactor  retirements  then  accelerate  in  subsequent  years  with  half  of  the  current
nuclear fleet retired by 2040 and only a handful of nuclear plants operating in 2050.
Q1b. Will  we  have  to  build  45–50  new  plants  and,  in  addition,  replace  our  current

103?

A1b. The  ‘‘45–50’’  gigawatts  (GW)  range  does  not  include  additional  new  plants
needed  to  replace  retiring  nuclear  plants.  The  45–50  new  plants  address  the  in-
crease  in  electricity  demand  over  the  next  25  years  (through  2032).  Additional  new
plants will be needed to replace the current operating plants when they are retired
in order to maintain nuclear’s share of electricity generation.
Q2. Is  the  Nuclear  Power  2010  program  on-schedule?  Between  this  program  and
EPACT,  are  they  sufficient  to  bring  on-line  the  necessary  nuclear  generation  we
need?

A2. The  Nuclear  Power  2010  program  is  on  schedule.  This  program  and  the  incen-
tives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will help offset the technical and financial
risks facing the ‘‘first movers’’ in building new nuclear power plants, and offer a sig-
nificant catalyst to get power companies to build new nuclear capacity. Over a dozen
power  companies  have  announced  their  intentions  to  apply  for  combined  Construc-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

94

tion  and  Operating  Licenses  (COLs)  for  over  30  nuclear  units.  The  reactor  designs
chosen, all being greater than 1,000 megawatts, represent as much as 46 gigawatts
of new capacity.

While  it  remains  uncertain  how  many  new  nuclear  plants  will  be  built,  as  new
nuclear plants are successfully placed into service on schedule and within projected
budgets, we can expect more orders to follow. However, these new orders are always
contingent on market conditions including factors such as the rate of growth in elec-
tricity demand, fossil fuels costs, manufacturing and construction infrastructure ca-
pability, and relevant environmental regulations.

Bringing  50–60  reactors  on  line  before  2032  would  dictate  a  pace  of  as  many  as
five per year over a 10–15 year period. Such a pace could be challenging, especially
if  there  is  a  delay  in  follow-on  orders,  as  utilities  await  successful  start-up  of  the
first  few  reactors  and  expansion  of  the  United  States  manufacturing  and  construc-
tion infrastructure.
Q3. One of the goals of the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative is to provide for prolifera-

tion-resistant technologies to recover the energy content in spent nuclear fuel.

Q3a. Is  this  program  creating  this  technology  or  does  it  already  exist  and  this  pro-

gram is expanding on it?

A3a. The  basis  for  a  proliferation-resistant  fuel  cycle  are  the  separations  processes
for  light  water  reactor  spent  nuclear  fuel  that  do  not  isolate  pure  plutonium;  fab-
rication of fuels and targets from the separated actinides for fast reactor transmuta-
tion; and recycle of spent fast reactor fuel, again without separating pure plutonium.
The technologies described above for a proliferation-resistant fuel cycle have been
demonstrated  only  in  small-scale  tests  conducted  at  the  national  laboratories,  but
the  results  are  encouraging.  AFCI  is  not  limiting  the  technology  to  domestic  use;
if applied world-wide, international proliferation risks would be greatly reduced.
Q3b. Is the 80 percent reduction in the volume of waste an accurate estimate?
A3b. The 80 percent reduction in waste volume resulting from application of the ad-
vanced fuel cycle technologies under development in AFCI/GNEP is a reasonable es-
timate  based  on  current  knowledge  and  experience,  as  well  as  numerous  assump-
tions regarding the nature of the wastes and the waste management processes used.
Q3c. Would  this  waste  require  the  same  conditions  for  burial  at  Yucca  as  the  waste

that is currently slotted to go there?

A3c. Assuming  deployment  of  GNEP  technologies  and  facilities  as  currently  envi-
sioned,  it  is  expected  that  the  volume,  heat  load  and  radio-toxicity  of  waste  to  be
disposed in a geologic repository will be reduced. The conditions for disposal of this
waste  have  not  yet  been  analyzed  in  detail,  although  it  is  possible  the  waste  pack-
ages  could  be  smaller  and,  because  of  reduced  heat  content,  more  densely  con-
centrated.

Question submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. Argonne  National  Laboratory  in  Illinois  receives  a  significant  portion  of  the
funds  for  GNEP.  Can  you  elaborate  on  the  Department’s  plan  to  utilize  the  re-
search at Argonne Lab to support GNEP as it moves forward?

A1. From its earliest beginning with the first nuclear pile at Stagg Field at the Uni-
versity  of  Chicago  in  1942,  the  history  of  the  U.S.  civilian  nuclear  power  program
has  been  supported  and  driven  by  the  technical  expertise  at  the  Argonne  National
Laboratory (ANL) and its associated facilities. The ANL expertise has been involved
in  virtually  all  U.S.  reactor  concepts  built,  or  envisioned,  up  to  this  time.  In  par-
ticular,  ANL  is  currently  supporting  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership’s
(GNEP)  advanced  spent  fuel  reprocessing  and  reactor  design  projects.  ANL  cur-
rently  receives  about  ten  percent  of  the  GNEP  funds  in  FY  2007  to  support  these
important  areas.  In  addition,  ANL  is  home  to  the  Advance  Fuel  Cycle  Initiatives’
national  technical  director  for  separations  and  the  campaign  manager  for  advanced
waste  forms  and  waste  management.  ANL’s  participation  and  contribution  to  the
GNEP effort is planned to evolve as the GNEP program is implemented.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Alexander  Karsner,  Assistant  Secretary  for  Energy  Efficiency  and  Re-

newable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy

Questions submitted by Subcommittee Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. Administration  support  for  renewable  electricity  technologies,  such  as  solar  PV
and wind, is much appreciated as concerns about foreign energy dependence and
climate change continue to increase. However, there is concern that the adminis-
tration seems to be picking winners, rather than providing broad-based support
across the entire spectrum of renewables technologies.
Section  931  of  EPACT  2005  specifically  directs  DOE  to  conduct  a  program  of
research,  development,  demonstration,  and  commercial  application  for  geo-
thermal energy.
Why  don’t  the  Department’s  FY07  and  FY08  budget  requests  reflect  the  direc-
tions given in EPAct for geothermal energy?

A1. Since the 1970s, the Department of Energy has conducted a research and devel-
opment  program  in  geothermal  technology  valued  in  excess  of  $1.3  billion.  That  in-
vestment  has  helped  to  produce  the  strong  market  for  geothermal  energy  we  see
today. Projects under construction, or which have both Power Purchase Agreements
and  are  undergoing  production  drilling,  amount  to  489  megawatts  in  eight  western
states.  Also,  the  industry  now  benefits  from  provisions  in  EPACT  providing  tax
credits and a streamlined leasing process.
Q2. The  Department’s  2003  Strategic  plan  included  geothermal  energy  research  as
part of its efforts to ‘‘improve energy security by developing technologies that fos-
ter  a  diverse  supply  of  reliable,  affordable,  and  environmentally  sound  en-
ergy. . .’’ Geothermal power was part of DOE’s ‘‘long-term vision of a zero-emis-
sion future in which the nation does not rely on imported energy.’’ But more re-
cently, the Department of Energy seems to not agree with this assessment.

Q2a. What  has  happened  in  the  past  three  years  to  apparently  change  the  Depart-

ment’s views of the geothermal resource base and its potential?

A2a. In  recent  years,  the  Department’s  Geothermal  Program  has  achieved  key  re-
search  objectives  for  conventional  hydrothermal  technology  development.  Geo-
thermal  power  production  from  high-temperature,  shallow  resources  is  now  a  rel-
atively  mature  energy  technology.  Projects  under  construction,  or  which  have  both
Power Purchase Agreements and are undergoing production drilling, amount to 489
megawatts (mw) in eight western states. Additionally, the Western Governors Asso-
ciation  geothermal  task  force  recently  identified  over  100  sites  with  an  estimated
13,000 MW of near-term power development potential.
Q2b. The  Department  indicated  in  2003  that  there  were  many  technological  chal-
lenges to achieving production from the vast geothermal resource base. Does the
Department  now  consider  these  challenges  are  solved  [sic],  have  new  informa-
tion  that  indicates  its  prior  assessments  of  geothermal  resources  are  incorrect
[sic],  or  has  the  Department  concluded  that  federal  efforts  and  technology  de-
velopment cannot overcome them?

A2b. Our  geothermal  program  has  achieved  its  key  research  objectives  for  conven-
tional  hydrothermal  technology,  and  has  provided  substantial  incentives  that  sup-
port  the  near-term  development  of  the  technology  and  deployment  of  the  large  geo-
thermal resource base.

The  Department  believes  that  recent  substantial  incentives,  many  authorized  by
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT), will do more to support development of the
conventional  hydrothermal  resources  than  technology  development  efforts.  For  ex-
ample,  geothermal  now  has  both  an  investment  tax  credit  and  a  production  tax
credit  that  will  improve  the  technology’s  competitive  position.  (Qualifying  facilities
can  claim  one  or  the  other,  but  not  both.)  EPACT  also  contains  provisions  that
streamline and accelerate the geothermal leasing process.
Q3. The  recent  MIT  report,  ‘‘The  Future  of  Geothermal  Energy’’  has  generated  sig-
nificant  interest  in  the  potential  for  Enhanced  Geothermal  Systems.  During  the
DOE  budget  hearing  on  March  7,  2007,  you  mentioned  that  DOE  had  not  had
the benefit of the MIT report in formulating the FY08 budget request.

96

Q3a. Having  now  had  the  opportunity  to  review  the  MIT  report,  does  it  in  any  way
change DOE’s assessment of the potential benefits to be gained from geothermal
R&D?

A3a. The MIT report, titled, ‘‘The Future of Geothermal Energy,’’ specifically points
to the potential benefits of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) as a long-term en-
ergy  option  for  the  Nation  and  it  is  a  significant  and  important  academic  contribu-
tion.  On  June  7&8,  EERE  conducted  a  workshop  with  industry,  also  entitled  ‘‘The
Future of Geothermal Energy,’’ to consider the findings of the report and hear from
stakeholders on research & development trends in the industry.
Q3b. How  does  DOE  view  the  potential  of  geothermal  resources,  especially  EGS  re-
sources  now?  Does  DOE  believe  EGS  merits  the  R&D  funding  support  rec-
ommended by the MIT report?

A3b. The  Department  is  using  some  of  the  FY  2007  geothermal  funding  to  conduct
a technology assessment of EGS to help industry prioritize its technology needs.
Q4. Congress recognized the need for R&D and deployment of new advanced hydro-
power  technologies,  when  in  Section  931  of  EPAct  2005,  it  directed  [sic]  Sec-
retary  to  conduct  a  program  of  research,  development,  demonstration  and  com-
mercial  application  for  Advanced  hydropower  technologies  to  enhance  environ-
mental performance and yield greater energy efficiencies.

Q4a. Why  don’t  the  Department’s  FY07  and  FY08  budget  requests  reflect  the  direc-

tions given in EPAct for hydropower?

A4a. The hydropower industry has demonstrated the ability to achieve efficiency op-
timization,  and  fish  survivability  performance  targets  without  further  DOE  direct
investment. In the fiscal year 2006 Appropriations Conference Report, the conferees
recommended  $495,000  for  hydropower  research  and  directed  the  Department  to
‘‘complete  integration  studies  and  close  out  outstanding  contracts  in  advanced  hy-
dropower technology.’’
Q4b. At  a  time  when  the  U.S.  is  looking  to  maximize  all  of  its  renewable  resources
because of the growing effect of climate change, why has the Department termi-
nated the hydropower R&D program?

A4b. The  Department  terminated  its  hydropower  program  in  fiscal  year  2005,  con-
sistent  with  congressional  direction  over  the  previous  years.  The  Department  com-
pleted  an  assessment  of  undeveloped  U.S.  hydropower  resources,  the  technologies
needed to develop the resources, and the feasibility of developing the resources, and
determined  that  the  Department  had  contributed  the  necessary  tools  to  industry  to
pursue development of these hydropower resources.
Q5. Preliminary  assessments  indicated  that  the  ocean  off  U.S.  coastlines  represents

a vast potential source of clean, renewable energy.

Q5a. Historically,  what  R&D  activities,  if  any,  has  DOE  conducted  in  the  area  of
ocean  power  (including  wave,  tidal,  current,  and  ocean  thermal  technologies)?
A5a. The  Department  had  a  program  that  ended  in  1994,  that  evaluated  Ocean
Thermal Energy which did not indicate commercial viability. DOE is currently sup-
porting a small project on wave energy technology R&D with one company and has
previously supported projects for ocean current and tidal technologies via the Small
Business Innovation Research Program.
Q5b. Given  the  early  developmental  stage  of  many  of  the  technologies  to  tap  the
ocean as an energy resource, why has DOE declined to request RD&D funding
to advance these technologies?

A5b. The  Department  is  monitoring  domestic  and  worldwide  progress  in  ocean  en-
ergy  technologies  in  collaboration  with  the  Electric  Power  Research  Institute  and
the  International  Energy  Agency.  Some  countries  with  higher  resource  potential
than  the  United  States,  relative  to  their  overall  energy  needs,  are  active  in  ocean
energy  R&D.  Ocean  wave  and  current  technologies  are  still  in  their  infancy  stage,
with  a  small  number  of  demonstration  systems  operating  worldwide.  The  Depart-
ment  will  continue  to  consider  emerging  technologies  like  ocean  energy  in  evalu-
ating  its  R&D  programs  based  on  assessment  of  national  potential  of  these  energy
resources,  results  of  R&D,  expected  technology  progress,  and  the  potential  benefit
from competing investments.

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon
Q1. There is enormous potential in deploying energy efficient technologies throughout
industry,  low-income  households  and  the  Federal  Government  itself.  Yet  pro-
grams  designed  to  do  exactly  that  (i.e.,  Federal  Energy  Management  Program,
Weatherization programs, Industrial Technologies) are being cut back.
Why is there an apparent lack of recognition by DOE of the need for greater em-
phasis on improving energy efficiency?

A1. The  Department  considers  energy  efficiency  as  a  critical  component  of  our  bal-
anced portfolio. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) pro-
grams  related  to  energy  efficiency  comprise  approximately  46  percent  of  the  total
EERE  proposed  FY  2008  budget  (including  program  direction  and  support  funds).
The Department is pursuing multiple programs to improve energy efficiency. Our
Federal Energy Management Program is actively promoting the use of Energy Sav-
ings  Performance  Contracting  (ESPC)  across  all  federal  agencies—awards  have  in-
creased  from  $36  million  in  2004,  to  $124  million  in  2005,  to  a  record  $321  million
in 2006. The Department provides education and outreach on nation-wide utility in-
centive  policies;  best  practices  on  demand-side  management  programs;  and  is  inte-
grating  energy  efficiency  into  utility,  State,  and  regional  resource  planning  activi-
ties.  To  assist  market  adoption  of  efficiency  measures,  our  Industrial  program  is
pursuing  a  number  of  voluntary  energy  savings  programs.  Our  ‘‘Save  Energy  Now’’
program  sends  energy  experts  to  the  nation’s  most  energy-intensive  manufacturing
facilities to conduct assessments on how these businesses can save energy.

The  Department  is  providing  funding,  tools,  and  technical  assistance  to  support
voluntary  energy  savings  programs  on  the  local  level  through  efforts  such  as  Re-
build America and the State Energy Program. Through these programs, many states
retrofit and update existing local government buildings, offices, and schools and also
inform  the  public  about  the  importance  of  energy  conservation.  In  addition,  our
Building  Technologies  Program  is  implementing  an  integrated  and  aggressive  plan
to  achieve  cost-neutral  Zero  Energy  Homes  by  2020,  and  commercial  buildings  by
2025. In addition, the Department helps accelerate the adoption of efficient building
technologies  and  products  in  the  market  through  the  EnergyStar®  rating  system.
Q2. The  Department’s  abysmal  record  on  promulgating  appliance  efficiency  stand-
ards  is  now  well  known  by  Congress,  consumers,  industry,  and  even  appliance
manufacturers.  It  has  come  to  the  Committee’s  attention  that  even  those  stand-
ards  that  DOE  has  promulgated  thus  far  are  considered  even  by  some  industry
representatives  to  be  ineffective  in  saving  energy  and  reducing  consumer’s  elec-
tricity  costs.  Though  the  exact  reasons  for  the  delays  and  the  promulgation  of
weak standards are not at all clear, the Committee appreciates that some atten-
tion is now being paid toward rectifying the situation at the Department.

Q2a. Please list all appliances for which DOE is required to promulgate standards.
A2a. Statutory requirements to promulgate standards cover the following categories
of  appliances.  Note  that  some  of  the  appliance  rule-makings  may  be  bundled  to-
gether for efficiency, so the number of final rule-makings may be lower. The Depart-
ment  is  on  schedule  to  complete  23  of  the  standards  by  June  2011  and  one  addi-
tional by 2015 (automatic ice makers).

Determinations are underway in the following categories:

• Battery Chargers and External Power Supplies (Determination Analysis)
• High Intensity Discharge Lamps (Determination Analysis)

Q2b. To date, how many standards have been promulgated since the Administration

took office in January 2001?

A2b. No  efficiency  standards  final  rules  have  been  promulgated  since  2001.  In  the
18  years  prior  to  the  January  31,  2006  report  to  Congress,  the  Department  issued
12  standards  for  products  other  than  those  directed  in  statute.  Congress  has  set
standards  in  legislation  as  recently  as  the  EPACT05  standards  for  15  additional
products.
Q2c. Of those standards that have been set or proposed by DOE, please specify when
the  standards  take  effect,  how  the  new  standards  improve  on  existing  stand-
ards, and the projections for energy and cost savings.

A2c. The proposed rule for Distribution Transformers was issued on August 4, 2006.
The  proposed  standards  would  take  effect  in  2010,  approximately  three  years  after
the  planned  issuance  of  the  final  rule.  The  Department’s  proposed  level  for  liquid-
immersed  and  medium  dry  voltage  distribution  transformers  would  save  2.4  Quads
of  cumulative  energy  over  29  years  (2010–2038).  In  addition,  the  cumulative  na-
tional net present value of total consumer costs and savings from 2010–2038 ranges
from  $2.52  billion  to  $9.43  billion,  depending  on  discount  rates.  The  proposed  rule
would improve on existing standards for transformers.

The  proposed  rule  for  Residential  Furnaces  and  Boilers  was  issued  on  October  6,

2006 with a standard effective date of 2015.

The  Department’s  proposed  standard  level  for  residential  furnaces  and  boilers
would save 0.41 Quads of cumulative energy over 24 years (2015–2038). In addition,
the cumulative national net present value of total consumer costs and savings from
2015–2038  ranges  from  $650  million  to  $2.48  billion.  The  proposed  rule  also  pro-

vided  an  initial  roadmap  for  states  to  petition  the  Department  for  exemption  from
preemption  of  the  federal  standards.  The  Department  recognizes  the  potential  for
additional energy savings that may be achieved under appropriately exempted state
standards.
Q2d. Please  provide  the  same  data  for  alternate  proposals  that  were  rejected  by

DOE.

A2d. First  to  be  clear,  the  Department  has  not  yet  issued  a  final  rule  for  furnaces
and boilers or distribution transformers. We are still in the process of analyzing the
proposed  rules  in  light  of  comments  received.  In  the  notices  of  proposed  rule-mak-
ing,  the  Department  considered  several  factors  for  economic  justification,  including
safety  and  regional  financial  impacts.  The  highest  standard  level  for  Distribution
Transformers  evaluated  is  estimated  to  save  9.8  quads  of  energy  but  is  estimated
to impose a net cost on consumers of $9.4 billion to $14.1 billion (2004$) in present
value  terms  at  three  percent  and  seven  percent  discount  rates,  respectively.  The
lowest standard level considered is estimated to save 1.8 quads and would save con-
sumers between $2.2 billion and $7.4 billion (2004$) in present value terms at three
percent and seven percent discount rates, respectively.
Q2e. Please  provide  details  on  the  perceived  limit  in  statutory  authority  to  develop

stricter standards that would ultimately save consumers billions?

A2e. The  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  directs  the  Department  to  establish
and amend energy conservation standards such that they achieve the maximum im-
provement in energy efficiency that is technologically feasible and economically jus-
tified.  Generally,  to  determine  whether  a  standard  is  economically  justified,  Con-
gress  directs  that  the  Department  determine  that  the  benefits  of  any  proposed
standard  exceed  its  burdens  to  the  greatest  extent  practicable.  Under  the  statute,
the Department cannot propose stricter standards if in so doing burdens exceed con-
sumer benefits.
Q2f. What  is  the  process  for  setting  these  standards,  which  federal  agencies  or  enti-
ties  are  involved  in  this  process,  and  who  makes  the  final  decision  on  setting
a standard?

A2f. As prescribed by the Energy Policy Conservation Act (EPCA), energy efficiency
standards generally are established by a three-phase public process: advance notice
of  proposed  rule-making  (ANOPR),  notice  of  proposed  rule-making  (NOPR),  and
final  rule.  DOE  seeks  public  comment  during  both  the  ANOPR  and  NOPR  phases
of the rule-making process. The last step in the rule-making process is the publica-
tion of a final rule in the Federal Register. The final rule promulgates standard lev-
els  based  on  all  of  the  analyses  and  explains  the  basis  for  the  selection  of  those
standards. It is accompanied by the final Technical Support Document.

In each rule-making, DOE must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and
executive  orders.  In  addition  to  the  statutory  criteria  that  must  be  considered  in
these rule-makings, the Department also analyzes and responds to public comment.
Additionally, the Department conducts reviews for the following 13 requirements:

1. Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, ‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review’’
2. Regulatory Flexibility Act
3. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
4. National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
5. E.O. 13132, ‘‘Federalism’’
6. E.O. 12988, ‘‘Civil Justice Reform’’
7. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995
8. Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999
9. E.O.  12630,  ‘‘Governmental  Actions  and  Interference  with  Constitutionally

Protected Property Rights’’

10. Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001
11. E.O.  13211,  ‘‘Actions  Concerning  Regulations  That  Significantly  Affect  En-

ergy Supply, Distribution, or Use’’

12. Section 32 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974
13. Congressional Notification

The Secretary of Energy makes the final decisions regarding all the Department’s

rule-makings.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. You  talk  about  the  technical  feasibility  for  wind  energy  to  generate  20  percent
of our nation’s electricity and to produce more than 300 gigawatts of production
capacity to our urban load centers.

Q1a. What is the time-frame for this goal?
A1a. The  time-frame  for  achievement  of  twenty  percent  production  by  wind  will  be
determined by the private sector in response to market signals.
Q1b. I  have  noticed  that  the  President’s  budget  did  not  include  an  extension  of  the
production tax credit. Do you see this as an impediment to reaching 20 percent
and 300 gigawatts?

A1b. Reaching  the  technical  feasibility  point  of  twenty  percent  generation  by  wind
will  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  private  sector  in  response  to  market  forces.
The Department works collaboratively with the Department of Treasury (which has
jurisdiction on these issues) on tax policy issues.
Q2. In  the  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership,  you  say  the  technologies  that  result
from it could lead to substantial oil savings if adopted by industry participants.
Is there a plan in place to encourage adoption?

A2. The  Partnership  focuses  on  the  high-risk  research  needed  to  develop  the  nec-
essary  technologies,  which  helps  reduce  costs  and  address  barriers.  However,  com-
mercialization  is  ultimately  industry’s  decision.  In  addition,  the  program’s  univer-
sity-oriented  activities  create  graduate  education  opportunities  working  with  new
technologies  and  encourage  undergraduate  engineering  students  to  gain  experience
with  hybrid  systems  technology  and  advanced  combustion  engines.  This  training
and  experience  can  help  ensure  the  work  force  has  the  necessary  expertise  to  help
industry such technologies to industry.
Q3. You  mention  in  your  testimony  that  R&D  on  combustion  engine  efficiency  will
allow ‘‘a car that previously got the CAFE average of 27 miles per gallon on gas-
oline  could  potentially  get  37  miles  per  gallon  with  an  advanced,  clean  diesel.’’

Q3a. Please explain what you mean by this.
A3a. Advanced  diesel  engines  can  provide  a  25–40  percent  improvement  in  fuel
economy relative to the average conventional gasoline engine of today, based on the
vehicle  type  and  application.  As  part  of  a  DOE  diesel  engine  development  project
for  a  light  truck/SUV  application,  a  fuel  economy  improvement  of  over  45  percent
was  demonstrated.  Hybridization  of  gasoline  passenger  vehicles  potentially  show
similar range increases in efficiency improvements. The mile per gallon figure stat-
ed above is an estimate and will vary depending on vehicle type and duty cycle.
Q3b. Is R&D being conducted on gasoline engines?
A3b. Yes,  R&D  is  being  conducted  on  gasoline  engines  with  the  goal  of  improving
their efficiency by 10 to 20 percent. Such R&D focuses on improving the combustion
process  for  higher  efficiency,  developing  catalysts  to  reduce  emissions  from  lean-
burn gasoline engines for passenger vehicle application, and enabling more efficient
use of ethanol.
Q4a. What biomass conversion technologies are available today for the production of

cellulosic ethanol?

A4a. The  conversion  technologies  that  are  available  today  can  be  categorized  into
two major types of processes, which each involve several types of feedstocks:

1. Biochemical  conversion  processes  combine  chemical  pretreatments,  enzy-
matic hydrolysis and fermentation to convert sugar from cellulosic feedstocks
into ethanol.

2. Thermochemical conversion processes aim to first convert the cellulosic feed-
stocks into synthesis gas or oil, and then convert these intermediate products
into ethanol either through fermentation or a catalytic reaction.

Q4b. How  long  will  it  take  for  these  conversion  technologies  to  become  cost  effective

for mass production?

A4b. The  Department’s  research  and  development  aims  to  make  both  biochemical
and thermochemical technologies cost competitive by 2012.
Q4c. How  are  we  going  to  move  from  10-percent  scale  demonstrations  to  full-scale

deployment by 2012?

101

A4c. The  Program’s  RD&D  reduces  the  overall  cost  and  risk  to  the  biomass  indus-
try,  and  improves  the  likelihood  of  obtaining  financing  for  full-scale  commercial  fa-
cilities.  Overall  knowledge  gained  from  the  10  percent  scale  solicitation  and  the
commercial  scale  Section  932  projects,  enzyme  and  ethanologen  development  R&D,
and  the  program’s  other  RD&D  is  aimed  at  accelerating  the  ability  of  the  biomass
industry  to  design  cost-competitive  cellulosic  ethanol  plants  to  meet  the  President’s
AEI 2012 goal.
Q4d. How  will  this  be  achieved  while  fulfilling  the  goal  of  making  these  cellulosic
based  biofuels  widely  available  to  the  public  at  reasonable  cost  to  all  Ameri-
cans?

A4d. We  believe  that  the  combination  of  the  accelerated  DOE  Biofuels  RD&D  pro-
grams,  the  President’s  legislative  proposals  to  implement  the  proposed  Alternative
Fuel  Standard  (AFS)  and  the  increasing  cooperation  with  USDA,  DOT  and  other
key  federal  agencies  to  facilitate  ethanol  deployment—are  part  of  a  coherent  ap-
proach needed to bring the costs in line with competing fuels. Then the market will
bring  the  benefits  of  cellulosic  ethanol  based  fuels  to  the  public  on  a  large  scale
within the next decade.
Q5. We’ve  heard  the  President  speak  of  switchgrass,  corn  stover,  and  wheat  straw
as feedstocks for cellulosic ethanol. Is enzyme research the Department is under-
taking going to be applicable across the spectrum of feedstocks?

A5. Yes. The enzyme research supported by EERE’s Biomass Program and the De-
partment’s  Office  of  Science  target  a  diverse  range  of  feedstocks  including
switchgrass,  corn  stover,  wheat  straw,  as  well  as  wood  chips.  In  recent  years,  the
Biomass Program’s research focused on using a combination of pretreatment and en-
zymes with corn stover as a model agricultural residue. This work is now beginning
to  focus  on  switchgrass  as  a  model  energy  crop.  One  of  the  Program’s  main  R&D
objectives  is  to  develop  more  efficient  enzymes  for  lignocellulosic  feedstocks  (e.g.,
woodchips)  and  make  them  a  part  of  an  integrated  process  that  minimizes  ethanol
costs.  To  this  end,  some  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act,  Section  932  selectees  will  work
with  leading  enzyme  companies  to  create  tailored  enzyme  preparations  for  their
feedstocks  of  interest.  Additionally,  a  new  solicitation  with  the  objective  of  increas-
ing  enzyme  efficiency  is  in  the  planning  stages  at  DOE.  It  is  envisioned  that  the
projects  awarded  from  this  solicitation  will  result  in  enzyme  systems  that  are  cost
effective for a variety of feedstocks.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. The  FY08  budget  request  calls  for  an  increase  of  38.8  percent  over  FY06  levels
for  hydrogen  technology  R&D.  How  does  the  Department  intend  to  spend  these
funds?

A1. The Department’s budget request of $307 million reflects the President’s Hydro-
gen Fuel Initiative commitment of $1.2 billion over five years (FY04 to FY08) to ac-
celerate  R&D  in  hydrogen  and  fuel  cell  technologies.  The  increased  funds  in  the
FY08  request  compared  to  the  FY06  appropriations  will  be  spent  on  basic  science
research through the Office of Science (an 83.1 percent increase) and on focused ap-
plied  R&D  through  the  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (an  in-
crease of 38.8 percent).
Q2a. I  am  disappointed  that  the  FY08  request  has  zeroed  out  funding  for  geo-
thermal.  Recently  there  has  been  a  great  deal  of  interest  in  deep  drilling  for
geothermal energy.
I  am  curious  to  know  whether,  in  making  the  decision  to  zero  out  geothermal
funding, there were any discussions about deep drilling potential?

A2a. Our geothermal program has achieved its key research objectives and has pro-
vided  substantial  incentives  that  support  the  near-term  development  of  the  tech-
nology  and  deployment  of  the  large  geothermal  resource  base.  The  FY  2007  oper-
ating  plan  for  the  Department  included  $5  million  to  support  geothermal  power  co-
produced with oil and gas demonstration efforts, for an evaluation of enhanced geo-
thermal  systems  to  help  industry  prioritize  its  technology  needs,  and  to  bring  to
completion  selected  projects  on  exploration,  drilling,  and/or  conversion  technologies.
Q2b. Has  there  been  consideration  for  a  demonstration-scale  project  of  an  under-

ground repository that you would mine for power generation on the surface?

A2b. Yes,  with  support  from  the  Department,  the  world’s  first  heat  mining  (also
called enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) project, where technology is used to cre-

ate  a  geothermal  reservoir,  was  undertaken  at  Fenton  Hill,  New  Mexico,  in  1976.
The initial work demonstrated the feasibility of extracting energy through heat min-
ing.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1a. Given  the  challenging  national  goals  being  set  by  Congress  and  the  President
for  increasing  the  role  of  renewable  energy  in  our  energy  mix,  what  are  the
long-term science and technology needs for solar, wind and biofuels?

A1a. The  Department  has  undertaken  a  thorough  review  of  these  needs  in  the  se-
ries of workshops around the topic of ‘‘Basic Research Needs to Assure a Secure En-
ergy Future.’’ The entire series of reports includes work on hydrogen, biofuels, solar,
nanotechnology,  etc.  and  is  available  at  this  website:  http://www.sc.doe.gov/bes/.
These  workshops  contributed  to  the  budget  and  policy  formation  processes  that  re-
sulted in the Advanced Energy Initiative and the American Competitiveness Initia-
tive.

Activities noted in the Advanced Energy Initiative (AEI) include lowering the cost
of  producing  cellulosic  ethanol,  improving  the  performance  of  lithium-ion  batteries
and  improving  the  cost  and  performance  of  wind  and  solar  technologies.  The  intro-
duction  of  these  advanced  technologies  in  the  marketplace  will  lower  the  costs  of
producing electricity from these renewable energies and will facilitate the growth of
a  productive  manufacturing  base  and  an  active  marketplace  for  renewable  energy
technologies.

As  identified  in  the  AEI,  long-term  science  and  technology  needs  for  solar  center
around  increasing  conversion  efficiency  and  lowering  costs,  including  the  develop-
ment  of  novel  compound  semiconductors,  polymers,  and  nanostructured  devices.
Work  is  also  needed  in  photoelectrochemical  materials  and  devices.  Solar  thermal
electric  systems  need  further  work  in  materials,  especially  thermal  storage  mate-
rials and high temperature working fluids. Thermochemical cycles are also of inter-
est  for  producing  fuels  such  as  hydrogen.  Improved  polymers  are  needed  for  low
temperature solar thermal applications.

Key activities for wind technologies will focus on research, development and test-
ing for improving the performance, cost effectiveness and reliability of large and dis-
tributed wind energy systems. For wind turbines, further long-term work is needed
for  meso-scale  atmospheric  modeling  to  improve  forecasting;  for  the  aerodynamics
of wind turbine blades such as turbulence, separation, stall, as well as improved ma-
terials  and  designs  for  turbine  blades,  gear-boxes  and  hubs;  and  for  power  elec-
tronics for converting power to 60 cycle line voltage.

For biofuels, further work is needed on both biochemical approaches for producing
biofuels, i.e., from cellulosic biomass—such as enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly for
systems  that  can  ultimately  enable  pretreatment,  hydrolysis,  and  fermentation  in
a  single  tank,  and  on  thermochemical  approaches  for  producing  biodiesel,  jet  fuel,
ethanol, and other fuels.
Q1b. Does the President’s budget for EERE strike the proper balance between invest-
ment  in  short-term  R&D  (e.g.,  improving  and  deploying  today’s  technology,
processes,  etc.)  and  investment  in  long-term  R&D  on  ‘‘game-changing’’  tech-
nologies (e.g., new biomaterials, PV nanostructures, etc.)?

A1b. Yes.  The  President’s  budget  request  for  EERE  strikes  the  proper  balance  of
short-term  RD&D  investments  and  longer-term  inquiries.  In  addition,  the  work  of
EERE  is  complemented  and  coordinated  with  that  in  the  Office  of  Science  to  maxi-
mize the benefit of the taxpayer’s investments.
Q1c. Please  describe  the  process  of  collaboration  between  EERE  and  the  Office  of

Science, if any.

A1c. In  addition  to  the  activities  mentioned  above,  EERE  and  the  Office  of  Science
(SC)  collaborate  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  technical  workshops,  roadmaps,
structured activities between SC and EERE, use by EERE-supported researchers of
SC  facilities,  and  joint  solicitations.  On  July  31,  2006,  the  Department  transmitted
to Congress, pursuant to Section 994 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a coordination
plan  detailing  a  variety  of  these  joint  activities,  including  a  number  of  workshops
conducted on basic science needs for EERE-related applied research.
Q1d. Is  there  an  established  process  whereby  basic  research  conducted  under  OS
programs  feeds  seamlessly  into  applied  research  under  the  auspices  of  EERE?
A1d. Yes. As discussed in the Section 994 report presented to Congress, the Depart-
ment periodically reviews science and technology activities, and provides an updated

coordination plan every four years. EERE also plans with SC, and manages a num-
ber of Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer
program (SBIR/STTR) activities for SC. Currently, EERE is managing six topics for
SC, with an annual value of approximately $15 million.
Q1e. Is the ‘‘balance’’ referenced above appropriate to strike within EERE? Or should
such a balance between short- and long-term research be struck between EERE
and OS?

A1e. Both.  As  part  of  its  balanced  portfolio,  EERE  pursues  near-,  mid-,  and  long-
term investment strategies for its applied research. The Office of Science is focused
on  basic  research,  but  new  technical  platforms  discovered  through  basic  research
can have a significant impact on EERE technologies in both the near-term and long-
term. We have strived to achieve a balance between the EERE and SC investments
to  ensure  technologies  are  proceeding  steadily  from  the  lab  to  applied  R&D  and  to
the marketplace.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Kevin  M.  Kolevar,  Director,  Office  of  Electricity  Delivery  and  Energy

Reliability, U.S. Department of Energy

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. I applaud your efforts to develop a comprehensive electric grid visualization ca-
pability  to  allow  improved  federal  response  during  emergencies  such  as  hurri-
canes and to identify regional and local impacts of energy disruptions. I under-
stand that the new transmission grid monitoring system that is now operational
at DOE enables situational awareness in the Southeastern United States.
• What  is  your  plan  to  extend  this  visualization  capability  across  the  United
• Could  additional  funding  and  other  resources,  if  they  were  brought  to  bear,

States?

help accelerate this process?

A1. I appreciate your interest in this important effort. Wide-area situational under-
standing is a key factor in managing the preparedness for and response to destruc-
tive events. The Department is partnering with the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, national laboratories, and industry to develop this strategic tool to enable real-
time status of the electric grid and to help identify the interdependencies with other
critical  energy  sectors.  Although  the  visualization  tool  is  now  operational  only  for
the  Southeastern  United  States,  we  are  working  with  other  major  utilities  in  mul-
tiple  regions  of  the  country  to  expand  real-time  status  information  on  a  national
level. Additional funding would accelerate the process.
Q2. In order for intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar to play a signifi-
cant  role  in  our  electricity  supply  system,  we  must  develop  technologies  to  store
the electricity when it is produced, then draw on it when we need it. As I under-
stand  it,  storage  is  one  of  the  major  obstacles  to  more  widespread  adoption  of
renewables.  There  is  a  significant  increase  in  R&D  funds  for  Energy  Storage,
but a commensurate decrease in funding for Renewable and Distributed Systems
Integration.
• Can you talk about the difference between the Energy Storage and the Renew-
able  and  Distributed  Systems  Integration  programs  and  why  one  is  being  in-
creased and the other cut?
• Can  you  comment  on  how  energy  storage  can  improve  the  value  of  renewable
• Why  is  funding  for  renewables  integration  falling  even  as  the  Administration
is  requesting  huge  funding  increases  for  technologies  like  solar  photovoltaics?
A2. In  FY  2006  and  FY  2007,  the  energy  storage  program  has  focused  on  dem-
onstrating and monitoring the performance of current state-of-the-art energy storage
technologies  in  partnership  with  the  California  Energy  Commission  (CEC)  and  the
New York Energy Research and Development Agency (NYSERDA). In FY 2008, the
Office  proposes  to  research  and  develop  the  next  generation  storage  concepts  to
lower  cost  and  improve  energy  density.  Under  the  Renewable  and  Distributed  Sys-
tems  Integration  activity  the  Office  proposes  to  coordinate  and  oversee  a  variety  of
demonstration  projects  that  integrate  renewables,  distributed  generation,  storage,
and advanced controls. This is in response to the recognition of the critical link be-
tween energy storage and renewables.

generation to the electric system?

The  decrease  in  funding  for  the  Renewable  and  Distributed  System  Integration
program  reflects  the  completion  of  turbine  and  engine  research,  which  will  now
transition to systems integration.

Energy  storage  can  significantly  increase  the  integration  of  renewable  sources  of
energy  into  the  electric  system.  Storage  increases  the  reliability  of  intermittent  re-
sources like wind and photovoltaics, allowing these sources to become relatively con-
stant sources of power. Renewable power produced in off-peak periods can be stored
and  used  during  periods  of  greater  demand,  thus  making  renewables  dispatchable.
Likewise,  energy  storage  can  bridge  the  gap  during  decreased  periods  of  renewable
production  and,  when  combined  with  appropriate  electronics,  it  can  also  eliminate
short-term flutters that decrease power quality and impact digital equipment on the
grid.

The Department has not had a dedicated integration program that brings together
renewables,  distributed  energy,  and  storage  with  advanced  communications.  In  FY
2008 the Office transitioned the focus of the Distributed Energy Research activities
to  Renewable  and  Distributed  Systems  Integration.  The  decrease  reflects  the  com-

pletion  of  distributed  generation  (microturbines,  reciprocating  engines)  activities  to
reflect  the  desire  of  the  Department  to  have  a  stronger  role  in  renewable  integra-
tion. In FY 2007, a solicitation was initiated that requested projects focusing on re-
newable systems integration such as photovoltaics.
Q3. One way to meet increased electricity demand is for utilities to build more wires
and  add  more  generation,  but  there  is  also  enormous  potential  that  we  have
barely begun to tap to increase the efficiency options for the grid itself, including
high  temperature  superconductors,  demand-side  management  technologies,  dis-
tributed generation and others.
• Why is overall R&D funding in these areas being cut?
• Could  you  discuss  how  your  office  is  pursuing  options  that  will  better  utilize

the existing infrastructure?

• Which national labs are involved in these efforts?

A3. We agree that there is enormous potential to increase the efficiency of the grid
itself  through  high  temperature  superconductors,  demand-side  management  tech-
nologies,  and  distributed  energy  technologies.  The  overall  cut  in  the  Office’s  R&D
funding occurred in two areas, High Temperature Superconductivity and Renewable
and  Distributed  Systems  Integration.  The  cut  in  High  Temperature  Superconduc-
tivity  funding  reflects  the  phasing  out  of  motor  research  and  completing  flywheel
cooperative agreements. The decrease in funding for the Renewable and Distributed
System Integration program reflects the completion of turbine and engine research,
which will now transition to systems integration.

The Office is pursuing three other paths in addition to High Temperature Super-
conductivity to improve/optimize the existing infrastructure. These include real-time
monitoring  and  control  of  the  grid,  advanced  energy  storage,  and  systems  integra-
tion research and demonstrations. Real-time monitoring and controls allow for faster
operations, which increases reliability, and reduced reserve margins. Energy storage
is  critical  overall  to  advancing  renewables  and  improving  grid  operations.  Renew-
able and Distributed Systems integration research is also demonstrating how to best
optimize grid asset utilization.

Many  of  the  national  laboratories  support  our  research  activities.  The  principle
laboratories  include:  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory,  Sandia  National  Laboratory,
Idaho  National  Laboratory,  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratories,  Lawrence
Berkley  National  Laboratory,  and  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory.  The  National
Energy  Technology  Laboratory,  a  federal  procurement  office,  provides  project  man-
agement activities for the Office.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  say  that,  ‘‘Superconductivity  holds  the  promise  of  ad-
dressing capacity concerns by maximizing use of available ‘footprint’ and limited
space,  while  moving  power  efficiently  and  reliably.’’  You  also  state  that  it,

• Given  the  importance  of  High  Temperature  Superconductivity,  can  you  please
explain  the  reasoning  behind  the  requested  35  percent  decrease  in  funding
from the FY06 level?

A1. The  cut  in  High  Temperature  Superconductivity  reflects  the  phasing  out  of
motor research and completing flywheel cooperative agreements. Approximately one-
third  of  the  $45  million  requested  for  the  High  Temperature  Superconductivity
(HTS)  subprogram  in  FY  2007  will  be  spent  on  research  of  wire  technologies:  2G
wire  development,  dielectrics,  cryogenics,  and  cable  systems.  This  represents  a  de-
crease  from  FY  2006,  when  approximately  half  of  the  HTS  subprogram’s  funding
was spent on these technologies, because these projects have successfully met mile-
stones, proven out their technological capabilities, and now move to the demonstra-
tion  phase  of  development.  In  contrast,  the  Office  expects  to  spend  approximately
two-thirds of the HTS subprogram’s funding on HTS applications in FY 2007, which
is  an  increase  from  FY  2006  when  just  half  of  the  funding  was  spent  in  this  area.
Since these applications, which include motors, have not performed as well, we will
now  focus  more  research  dollars  on  achieving  similar  successes  as  have  been  seen
with the wire technologies. Thus, the Department is focusing on a near-term critical
need within the electric system to not only increase current carrying capacity, espe-
cially  in  urban  areas,  but  also  to  relieve  overburdened  cables  elsewhere  in  local
grids.

Q2. In  regards  to  the  Infrastructure  Security  and  Energy  Restoration  activity,  FY08
recommends a decrease from FY07. Given the importance of this activity in pro-
tecting  the  Nation’s  critical  energy  infrastructure  and  assisting  State  and  local
governments  with  energy  disruption  preparation  and  response,  please  explain
the reasoning behind the reduced funding request.

A2. Although  there  is  a  slight  decrease  of  $219,000  in  the  FY  2008  budget  request
from  the  FY  2007  request,  the  Department  still  considers  its  obligations  to  protect
the  Nation’s  critical  energy  infrastructure  under  the  Homeland  Security  Presi-
dential Directives 7 and 8 to be extremely important. The Department’s involvement
with  current  critical  energy  infrastructure  programs  and  its  commitment  to  assist-
ing  State  and  local  governments  with  disruption  preparation  and  response  is  and
will  continue  to  be  a  priority.  There  is  presently  less  of  a  need  for  as  much  outside
support. Therefore, this decrease reflects the reduction of laboratory staff by one in
order to accommodate program priorities.
Q3. I  understand  that  Transmission  Reliability  R&D,  Energy  Storage  R&D,
Gridwise,  Gridworks  and  most  projects  in  Electricity  Distribution  Trans-
formation R&D programs are transferred to the Visualization and Controls sub-
account as of FY07. The FY08 request for this sub-account is $25.3 million, but
the  budget  for  these  five  activities  in  FY06  was  $83.9  million.  Please  explain
this.

A3. The  Visualization  and  Controls  sub-account  included  the  transfer  of  high-pri-
ority  projects  from  the  Transmission  R&D,  Gridwise,  and  Gridworks  programs.  In
FY  2006,  the  budget  for  these  three  (3)  activities  was  $22.6  million.  The  FY08  re-
quest  for  the  Visualization  and  Controls  sub-account  has  been  increased  to  $25.3
million,  which  includes  additional  funding  for  cyber  security  research.  Most  of  the
projects  in  the  Electricity  Distribution  Transformation  R&D  program  have  been
transferred to the Distributed Systems Integration sub-account.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. The FY08 request for High Temperature Superconductivity R&D is significantly
reduced  from  the  FY06  and  FY07  requests.  At  one  time  this  issue  was  viewed
as a great investment for potentially large energy efficiency gains.
• What is Department’s plan to continue research in this field?
• Does  the  Dept.  no  longer  see  the  promise  in  the  technology  that  it  had  pre-

viously, or are the major research questions essentially resolved?

A1. High  Temperature  Superconductivity  (HTS)  holds  tremendous  promise  for
maximizing  delivery  capacity  in  existing  rights-of-way  while  minimizing  energy
losses.  Over  the  past  20  years,  the  Department  has  stewarded  federal  resources  to
carry this technology from inception to commercialization. In the last year, we began
to  witness  the  returns  on  this  investment  with  the  demonstration  of  short-length
HTS  cables  at  multiple  sites  in  New  York  and  Ohio.  These  projects  reaffirmed  the
potential  benefits  of  this  revolutionary  technology.  In  FY08,  the  Department  plans
to  use  available  funds  to  continue  support  for  core  research  in  second-generation
wire  development,  as  well  as  to  sponsor  projects  that  enable  installation  of  longer-
length  HTS  cables  and  other  applications  that  address  many  of  the  research  ques-
tions that remain unresolved. The cut in High Temperature Superconductivity fund-
ing  reflects  the  phasing  out  of  motor  research  and  completing  flywheel  cooperative
agreements.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Thomas  D.  Shope,  Principal  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Fossil  En-

ergy, U.S. Department of Energy

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  established  a  research  program  for  Ultra-deep-
water  and  Unconventional  Natural  Gas  and  petroleum  exploration.  This  is  a
program  that  Congress  clearly  cares  about,  and  the  President  apparently  ap-
proved  of  by  signing  it  into  law.  However,  the  Department  sent  a  letter  to  Con-
gress  asking  to  rescind  this  section  of  law,  and  failed  to  include  funding  in  the
FY  2007  Operating  Plan,  effectively  killing  this  program.  Furthermore,  you  are
proposing to cancel out oil and gas research altogether, apparently with the rea-
soning that this R&D can be done by industry alone. This is surprisingly short-
sighted  on  the  part  of  the  Administration  given  the  enormous  hydrocarbon  re-
sources  in  these  fields,  and  the  fact  that,  because  of  cost  and  technical  com-
plexity of extracting these resources, only the biggest of oil companies can afford
to  do  the  research  and  deploy  the  technologies.  These  large  companies  simply
have priorities elsewhere.

Q1a. What  reasons  does  the  Department  have  for  eliminating  the  Ultra-deep  pro-

gram, especially in light of its elimination of oil and gas research?

A1a. The  Administration’s  request  to  repeal  this  program  is  based  on  the  fact  that
oil  and  gas  are  mature  industries  that  have  every  incentive,  particularly  at  today’s
prices,  to  enhance  production  and  continue  research  and  development  of  tech-
nologies  on  their  own.  There  is  no  need  for  taxpayers  to  subsidize  oil  companies  in
these  efforts.  The  Administration’s  Research  and  Development  Investment  Criteria
direct  programs  to  avoid  duplicating  research  in  areas  that  are  receiving  funding
from  the  private  sector.  We  believe  that  independent  producers,  as  well  as  the  ma-
jors,  will  continue  to  purchase  innovative  technologies  developed  by  service  compa-
nies.
Q1b. If  Congress  does  not  rescind  this  section  of  law  will  the  Department  carry  out

this very vital research program as it is instructed to do by law?

A1b. Yes,  the  Department  is  currently  implementing  the  program  according  to  the
requirements of the law and will continue to do so unless the law is repealed.
Q1c. Why  have  no  funds  been  apportioned  to  the  National  Energy  Technology  Lab-
oratory  for  carrying  out  the  activities  assigned  to  it  in  Subtitle  J  of  EPAct
2005?

A1c. The  $50  million  available  under  Subtitle  J  in  FY  2007  has  been  apportioned
to  NETL.  NETL  has  begun  work  to  produce  the  first  annual  research  and  develop-
ment plan, which is required under the subtitle before research solicitations can be
issued. Development and review of this plan, including review by two Federal Advi-
sory Committees, is proceeding.
Q1d. How  could  smaller  firms  leverage  federal  resources  for  oil  and  gas  research?
A1d. Small firms will be eligible for research awards under the Subtitle J program.
They  may  submit  research  proposals  themselves  or  team  with  other  organizations
such as research laboratories or universities to apply for federal funds. Small firms
may want to pay special attention to the portion of the solicitation for proposals that
will  deal  with  the  technology  challenges  of  small  producers,  one  of  the  research
areas specified by the law.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. In the President’s 2007 State of the Union speech he stated that ‘‘It’s in our vital
interest  to  diversify  America’s  energy  supply—the  way  forward  is  through  tech-
nology,’’  that  we  must  increase  the  supply  of  alternative  fuels,’’  and  that  we
should  ‘‘dramatically  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.’’  One  of  the  most
promising  ways  to  achieve  these  goals  is  through  development  of  coal-to-liquids
facilities.
• Why  is  there  so  little  funding  recommended  in  the  FY  2008  budget  for  coal-
• How does DOE justify this lack of funding of such a critical technology?

to-liquids programs?

A1. Although  past  Department  efforts  and  some  congressionally  directed  funding
has  focused  on  production  of  liquid  fuels  from  coal,  the  FY  2008  Budget  does  not
support these activities. Coal to liquids is a mature technology with evolutionary ad-
vances and incremental improvements possible, and therefore is not consistent with
the  Research  and  Development  Investment  Criteria.  Past  government  funded  pro-
grams  have  resulted  in  improved  processes,  catalysts  and  reactors,  but  there  were
no  realized  economic  benefits  because  the  technology  was  still  not  economic  given
other  business  risks  and  considerations,  indicating  that  the  obstacle  was  more  due
to  market  factors  than  technical  issues.  These  coal-to-liquid  processes  can  produce
clean,  zero-sulfur  liquid  fuels  that  are  cleaner  than  required  under  the  Tier  II  fuel
regulations. The fuels are compatible with petroleum fuels and can utilize the same
distribution infrastructure.

The  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  in  DOE  carries  out  an  extensive  research  and  tech-
nology development in coal gasification and hydrogen from coal. The targets of these
programs  are  improved  technology  for  clean  coal-based  power  generation  systems
(for  example,  integrated  coal  gasification  combined-cycle)  and  hydrogen  production
from  coal,  including  DOE’s  FutureGen  project.  Because  of  technology  overlaps  be-
tween CTL fuel systems and coal gasification-based power and hydrogen production
systems, nearly all of the President’s FY 2008 budget for the DOE programs in coal
gasification  and  coal  fuels  ($65  million)  and  a  significant  portion  of  the  $27  million
for advanced research support research and technology development that is relevant
to the production of CTL fuels.

A  major  concern  regarding  deployment  of  CTL  technology  is  the  potential  impact
on greenhouse gas emissions. The FY 2008 Budget provides $86 million for research
directed  at  carbon  capture  and  sequestration.  This  work  is  relevant  to  addressing
the  uncertainties  regarding  the  viability  of  CTL  fuels  production  if  carbon  dioxide
emissions  need  to  be  controlled.  The  Sequestration  Program  is  focused  on  applica-
tions for coal gasification power generation and hydrogen production.
Q2. OMB  and  the  Natural  Research  Council  of  the  National  noted  that  substantial
benefits  accrue  from  the  DOE  coal  R&D  program  and  from  the  continued  use
of  coal  in  the  energy  mix.  However,  OMB  and  NRC  have  repeatedly  criticized
DOE for failing to establish a consistent measurement system for the future ben-
efits  of  its  coal  research  program,  the  distribution  of  these  benefits  between  the
public  and  private  sectors,  and  the  methodology  and  assumptions  used  in  esti-
mating program costs and benefits.
• Why  has  DOE  been  lax  in  developing  these  measures  and  what  steps  will  be
• Does  DOE’s  continuing  failure  to  adequately  estimate  the  benefits  of  its  coal

taken to remedy this deficiency in FY 2008?

programs jeopardize future funding for these programs?

A2. DOE  has  made  significant  efforts  in  recent  years  to  develop  a  methodology  for
estimating  the  benefits  of  its  research  and  development  (R&D)  activities  that  can
be implemented on a consistent basis across all programs. Results from these efforts
are  included  in  the  FY  2008  budget  submission  to  Congress.  The  Department  is
working  to  improve  consistency  across  programs  in  the  methodology  and  assump-
tions used in estimating program costs and benefits. The assumptions and methods
underlying  the  modeling  efforts  have  significant  impacts  on  the  estimated  benefits.
Results  could  vary  significantly  if  external  factors  differ  from  the  baseline  case  or
alternative scenarios assumed for this analysis.

At the heart of the methodology is the National Energy Modeling System (HEMS),
which  DOE/EIA  uses  for  its  Annual  Energy  Outlook.  The  DOE  offices  of  Nuclear
Energy,  Fossil  Energy,  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy,  and  Electricity
Supply and Energy Reliability use a consistent NEMS framework in conducting ben-
efits analysis. Thus consistent policy assumptions are applied to all programs. Each
of  these  DOE  programs  are  evaluated  against  a  consistent  set  of  ‘‘success’’  and  ‘‘no
success’’  assumptions,  and  all  benefits  reporting  for  DOE  programs  are  based  on  a
consistent  set  of  metrics  for  economic,  environmental,  and  energy  security  impacts.
In December 2006, a group of external peer reviewers assessed the consistent policy
scenarios applied to all of these DOE programs. In addition to addressing comments
from  the  reviewers,  DOE  is  also  working  to  develop  consistent  methodologies  for
gathering cost and performance data for energy systems and for projecting this data
into the future.

There are two major challenges that DOE is continuing to deal with in its efforts

to improve its benefits estimates:

1. Making  benefits  estimates  intuitive  and  understandable  to  its  stakeholders,
in spite of the large number of major assumptions needed to predict how an

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:14 Jan 17, 2008 Jkt 033610 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\030707\33610 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

109

advanced  energy  technology  might  perform  and  compete  over  the  next  50
years.

2. Dealing  with  the  inherent  risk  associated  with  R&D.  One  simply  cannot
state with certainty how likely high-risk R&D, especially for major programs,
such  as  the  near-zero  atmospheric  emissions  coal  plant  (including  CO2 cap-
ture and storage), is to meet its time and performance goals. A further com-
plication is that in order to estimate the benefits of an advanced energy sys-
tem, it must be competed against other advanced systems that also have sig-
nificant risk associated with meeting cost and performance goals.

The  first  item  is  largely  a  communication  challenge,  and  we  are  working  on  new
ways  to  display  and  explain  our  results.  The  second  is  an  extreme  methodological
challenge.

The  Department  is  currently  pilot  testing  several  risk  methodologies  and  will  be

evaluating the results throughout FY 2007.

We do not believe that the methodological challenges to improve R&D benefits es-
timates  should  jeopardize  programmatic  funding.  In  some  cases  a  ‘‘rough’’  estimate
of  benefits  can  be  made  that  is  sufficient  to  justify  that  support  for  certain  R&D
should  be  a  priority.  For  example,  relatively  simple  analysis  that  considers  the  de-
gree  to  which  greenhouse  gases  will  need  to  be  reduced  over  time,  and  the  limited
number  of  options  for  effecting  major  greenhouse  gas  reductions,  strongly  suggests
that a variety of options will be necessary to tackle this problem, and that reducing
the  cost  of  these  options  will  have  huge  societal  benefits.  R&D  to  reduce  the  cost
of  coal-fueled  electricity  generation  that  includes  carbon  capture  and  storage  is
clearly one of the more promising options.
Q3. FutureGen  is  one  of  the  projects  at  the  forefront  of  the  new  technology  effort.
Central  to  the  success  of  FutureGen  is  the  ability  to  sequester  CO2 emissions.
Has the department explored possible storage sites for this sequestered CO2?

A3. Yes,  as  part  of  the  FutureGen  site  selection,  possible  storage  sites  for  the  se-
questered  CO2 from  FutureGen  is  being  explored  via  a  competitive  site  selection
process through a solicitation that was issued on March 7, 2006, by the FutureGen
Alliance,  our  industry  partner.  Twelve  sites  in  seven  states  submitted  proposals  to
host  the  FutureGen  site.  These  sites  had  to  pass  qualification  criteria  to  be  given
further  consideration  against  a  set  of  rigorous  site  evaluation  criteria.  The
FutureGen  Alliance  selected  four  finalist  sites  from  that  group:  Mattoon,  IL;
Tuscola, IL; Heart of Brazos near Jewett, TX; and Odessa, TX. A final site selection
by  the  Alliance  is  expected  to  be  made  later  this  year  after  the  completion  of  the
environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act.
Q4. Assuming it will be possible to inject the CO2 into the ground, what type of legal
and regulatory framework needs to be in place in order to ensure that these types
of plants will be built, and provide for safe long-term storage of large scale, long
lived sequestered CO2?

A4. It will be necessary to have legal and regulatory frameworks developed specifi-
cally  for  carbon  capture  and  storage  projects.  Frameworks  can  either  be  adopted  or
adapted  from  existing  regulatory  frameworks.  The  Department  of  Energy  has  been
working  with  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  and  the  Interstate
Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) in the review and development of regu-
latory frameworks for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

CCS  can  be  divided  into  four  areas:  capture,  transportation,  injection,  and  long-
term  storage  of  CO2.  It  has  been  suggested  that  the  existing  regulations  under  the
Clean  Air  Act  could  be  adopted  to  permit  modifications  necessary  to  capture  CO2
from power plants. Transportation of CO2 via pipelines, rail and trucks is currently
regulated  under  federal  and  State  statutes  through  their  respective  transportation
agencies  and,  therefore,  no  new  regulations  for  the  transport  of  CO2 are  necessary.
Frameworks  for  the  injection  and  long-term  storage  of  CO2 in  geologic  formations
could  be  developed  from  existing  analogous  regulations  such  as  the  Safe  Drinking
Water  Act  (SDWA)  Underground  Injection  Control  (UIC)  Program,  which  are  cur-
rently  implemented  by  federal  or  State  environmental  and/or  oil  and  gas  divisions.
CO2 injections  for  enhanced  oil  and  gas  recovery  are  currently  permitted  as  UIC
Class  II  operations.  The  EPA  has  recently  issued  guidance  to  the  EPA  regions  and
states that would allow the deep saline tests under the Regional Carbon Sequestra-
tion  Partnerships  to  be  permitted  as  Class  V,  experimental  projects.  The  lessons
learned from these research projects will provide the technical data to permit future
full  scale  CO2 injection  projects  either  under  the  existing  UIC  framework  or  as  a
new  well  classification.  Regulations  for  the  long-term  storage  and  liability  could  be

110

modeled  after  the  UIC  program  but  will  need  to  be  developed  before  sequestration
can be adopted as a commercial opportunity to mitigate Greenhouse Gases.
Q5. The  Administration  has  indicated  its  strong  interest  in  the  development  of  new
and alternative sources of energy. One of the goals of this new technology would
be to reduce carbon emissions.
• In  looking  at  the  situation  today,  what  would  you  estimate  the  cost  to  be  for

a power plant to install current CO2 capture and sequester technology?

• What is the availability of such technology? Is it easily obtained?

A5. The  capture  costs  will  vary  depending  on  the  type  of  power  plant  and  if  the
plant  is  existing  or  a  new  build.  The  costs  to  install  the  technology  include  capital
costs  for  equipment  and  operational  costs  and  can  be  displayed  as  increased  in  the
cost-of—electricity, incremental plant capital cost, and cost of CO2 avoided and cap-
tured. The following table gives estimated current costs. Actual costs could vary sig-
nificantly based on the specific plant configuration.

The increased costs of electricity for capturing and storing CO2 are significant and
the  Fuels  and  Power  Systems  Program  is  undertaking  extensive  R&D  to  reduce
these  costs.  The  current  costs  of  these  particular  scenarios  are  explained  in  more
detail in the paragraphs below.
Post-combustion CO2 Capture:

Installing  CO2 capture  on  a  new  super-critical  pulverized  coal  power  plant  using
current  state-of-the  art  amine  scrubbing  technology  (capable  of  capturing  90+  per-
cent of CO2 emissions) results in an incremental total plant capital cost (TPC) equal
to  $1,294/kW.  This  corresponds  to  an  incremental  increase  in  cost  of  electricity
(COE)  of  4.7cents/kWh  (from  6.4  cents/kWh  to  11.1  cents/kWh)  equivalent  to  $63/
ton  CO2 avoided  and  $41/ton  CO2 captured  [1].  The  current  state-of-the-art  amine
scrubbing  is  based  of  the  Econamine  FG+  carbon  dioxide  capture  process  being  de-
veloped by Fluor Corporation. Significant technical and economical improvements in
amine  scrubbing  have  been  made  in  the  past  10  years  with  the  leading  technology
developers being Fluor Corporation and Mitsubishi.
Pre-combustion CO2 Capture:

Installing  CO2 capture  on  a  new  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  power
plant  using  current  state-of-the-art  Selexol  scrubbing  technology  (capable  of  cap-
turing  90+  percent  of  CO2 emissions)  results  in  an  incremental  total  plant  capital
cost  (TPC)  equal  to  -$625/kW.  This  corresponds  to  an  incremental  increase  in  cost
of electricity (COE) of 2.5 cents/kWh (from 7.5 cents/kWh to 10.0 cents/kWh) equiva-
lent to $33/ton CO2 avoided and $26/ton CO2 captured.

As  of  2004,  there  are  more  than  30  small  amine  scrubbing  plants  currently  cap-
turing  CO2 from  flue  gas  sources  (post  NGCC  and  PC)  to  be  used  as  feed  sources
for enhanced oil recovery, the chemical industry and the food/beverage industry. The
size of the current installations range between 100 and 1,000 ton CO2 captured per
day-significantly smaller than that required for a full-size PC power plant removing
17,000  ton  CO2/day.  Although  Fluor  Corporation  is  offering  the  Econamine  FG+  at
this  full-scale,  it  is  clear  that  some  commercial  development  is  still  required  to  ex-
tend  the  envelope  of  commercial  availability  into  the  region  required  by  large  scale
power plants.

The  current  state-of-the-art  for  Selexol  Scrubbing  is  based  of  the  designs  devel-
oped  by  UOP.  There  are  55+  worldwide  Selexol  Scrubbing  processes  removing  CO2
from natural gas—the process is considered to be commercially available at the size
required for a full-scale Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plant.
Q6. Section  1407  of  EPACT  authorized  $100  million  a  year  for  three  years  for  high
temperature Oxyfuel technology. It was to go to two small and two large Oxyfuel
coal plants, both new and retrofits. The DOE has never funded that section nor
is there any money in the budget for Oxyfuel technology.
• Why has section 1407 not been funded and why is there no focus on retrofits?
A6. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) is the primary vehicle used by the De-
partment  of  Energy  to  fund  demonstration  scale  advanced  coal  technology  projects
such  as  the  high  temperature  Oxyfuel  technology  demonstrations  authorized  under
section  1407  of  EPACT  2005.  In  FY  2008,  the  Department  expects  to  complete  the
CCPI Round 3 solicitation and proposal evaluations. Both new projects and retrofits
are  eligible  to  apply  for  funding  as  part  of  this  vehicle.  The  solicitation  will  be  fol-
lowed  by  project  selections  to  assemble  the  initial  portfolio  of  advanced  technology
systems with carbon capture for sequestration and beneficial reuse. In addition, the
FY  2008  coal  budget  request  includes  $5  Million  for  Oxyfuel/Oxycombustion  R&D
to continue the work begun in FY 2007 and earlier.

Questions submitted by Representative Jerry F. Costello
Q1. Can you please give an update of the status of the FutureGen project?
A1. The  project  is  moving  forward  on  schedule.  We  have  completed  the  first  phase
of  the  project,  which  included  completion  of  the  initial  conceptual  design  and  the
initiation of the environmental review process as required under the National Envi-
ronmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA).  In  addition,  under  the  first  phase,  a  competitive  site
selection  solicitation  was  issued  on  March  7,  2006,  by  the  FutureGen  Alliance,  our
industry  partner.  Twelve  sites  in  seven  states  submitted  proposals  to  host  the
FutureGen site. The FutureGen Alliance selected four finalist sites from that group:
Mattoon, IL; Tuscola, IL; Heart of Brazos near Jewett, TX; and Odessa, TX. We are
aiming  to  complete  the  NEPA  process  this  year  to  be  followed  by  a  final  site  selec-
tion by the Alliance. We expect to continue preliminary design of the facility as well
as  further  site  characterization  on  the  specific  site  when  it  is  selected.  The  project
is on target for a 2012 start date for operations.
Q2. In FY 2007 the Administration requested $54 million for the FutureGen project.
Since the FY 2006 enacted level for the project was $18 million, does the Depart-
ment  intend  to  make  up  the  $36  million  shortfall  needed  to  keep  the  project  on
schedule?

A2. The Administration has requested and Congress has appropriated funds needed
to  keep  the  project  on  schedule,  consist  with  the  project  funding  plan  described  in
the  2004  FutureGen  report  to  Congress.  This  funding  stream  includes  $18  million
in FY 2006 and $54 million in FY 2007.
Q3. As  you  know,  the  President’s  budget  proposal  for  FY08  seeks  to  eliminate  funds
needed  for  FutureGen  in  the  out  years.  How  can  it  keep  its  construction  dead-
line?

A3. The President’s FY 2008 budget for FutureGen is $108 million, consistent with
the  project  funding  plan.  We  are  moving  forward  with  the  project  activities  with
construction  to  begin  in  FY  2009  and  start-up  of  operations  in  2012.  We  intend  to
request  the  necessary  funds  in  the  out  years  consistent  with  this  project  schedule.
Q4. Please  explain  why  DOE  reduced  the  number  of  carbon  sequestration  projects
around  the  country  and  how  DOE  will  decide  which  projects  to  cut.  How  does
the FY07 Operating Plan change this?

A4. The  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  has  been  focusing  its  efforts  on  implementation  of
twenty-five  field  validation  tests  through  the  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Part-
nerships  (RCSP)  Phase  II  initiative.  These  tests  are  designed  to  validate  promising
geologic  formations  in  their  regions  to  store  CO2.  The  tests  are  testing  the
injectivity, modeling the fate, and measuring the response of the CO2 in the forma-
tions.  In  addition,  these  tests  are  developing  the  protocols  for  site  characterization,
monitoring, infrastructure development, operations, and closure that will be used to
develop  future  large  scale  field  tests.  The  information  collected  in  these  tests  will
support  the  development  of  Phase  III,  Large-Volume  Testing,  and  provide  informa-

tion  that  can  be  used  to  inform  future  commercial  Carbon  Capture  and  Storage
sites.

In  FY  2008,  the  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Partnerships  (CSRP)  Field  Vali-
dation  Testing  activities  (Phase  II)  will  complete  and  publish  results  for  several  of
the  25  geologic  sequestration  tests  involving  CO2 injection  and  monitoring,  mitiga-
tion,  and  verification  (MMV)  operations  in  saline  formations,  depleted  oil  and  gas
fields, and unmineable coal seams. The Department will prioritize among its Phase
II  tests,  beginning  with  those  that  offer  the  greatest  potential  benefits.  The  initial
focus will be weighted toward saline formations, since they are expected to offer the
greatest  capacity  for  geologic  carbon  sequestration.  The  Department  will  also  ini-
tiate an expedited schedule for the multi-year Phase III of the Regional Partnership
Program.  In  FY  2008,  Phase  III  work  will  include  the  conduct  of  four  large  scale
field  tests,  including  completion  of  the  NEPA  Process  for  selected  sites,  and  other
work. In coordination with the current partnerships, the program will determine the
‘‘highest  potential’’  opportunities  for  the  initial  expedited  round  of  large  scale  se-
questration  tests  in  saline,  coal,  and/or  oil  and  gas  bearing  formations.  Due  to  the
increased  funding  level  in  FY  2007,  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  was  able  to
initiate Phase III in FY 2007, further expediting the schedule for these highest pri-
ority  tests.  The  Department  will  continue  to  apply  a  prioritization  process  to  expe-
dite the most important Phase II and Phase III tests. Several of the Phase 11 tests
are  being  strategically  conducted  to  support  Phase  III  activities.  In  addition  to  the
knowledge  gained  by  the  Phase  II  tests,  the  initial  work  on  well  construction  and
characterization may support the Deployment Phase should one of the sites used for
Phase  II  testing  provide  the  necessary  environment  for  Large-Volume  Deployment
Testing.

The  DOE  will  continue  these  field  validation  (Phase  II)  tests  through  FY  2008.
Starting  at  the  end  of  FY  2007  and  through  2008  the  DOE  will  complete  National
Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  activities  and  initiate  four  large  volume  seques-
tration tests through the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships. This will in-
clude  the  site  characterization  and  infrastructure  development  for  storage  projects
that will inject up to one million tons of CO2 per year for several years. It is possible
that  injection  could  occur  in  FY  2008.  We  are  also  working  closely  with  the  EPA
to assess requirements and procedures for permitting future commercial geologic se-
questration deployments.
Q5. Since last July, all the DOE Carbon Sequestration Partnerships have been con-
tributing to a thoroughly vetted capacity methodology that will result in a DOE-
produced  atlas  identifying  areas  in  the  U.S.  which  have  sequestration  capacity.
This atlas is scheduled to be published in May of this year.
• Are you aware of any shortcomings with the DOE Partnerships to identify and

• Second, do you believe additional funding is needed to identify more sequestra-

tion sites in the United States?

A5. The Atlas represents Phase I (2003–2006) of the Regional Carbon Sequestration
Partnerships  assessment  of  geological  storage  capacity.  The  Department  of  Energy
(DOE) is using existing funding to work on both historical and field data collection.
During  Phase  II,  which  will  last  until  2009,  the  Partnerships  are  gathering  addi-
tional  information  on  geologic  formations  throughout  the  United  States.  This  in-
cludes open source data gathered from Federal and State Geologic Surveys and pro-
prietary data from industry partners. The information collected during Phase II will
be  used  to  update  the  capacity  estimates  throughout  the  United  States  and  revise
and issue an updated version of the Atlas in 2009. DOE expects to continue the ef-
fort to characterize additional geologic formations after 2009 during Phase III of the
program.  In  addition,  the  data  collected  during  the  Phase  II  field  validation  tests
and  Phase  III  large  volume  sequestration  test  will  be  used  to  validate  the  capacity
estimates  presented  in  the  Atlas.  DOE  will  continue  to  use  its  resources  to  develop
technologies  and  evaluate  whether  projects  will  be  able  to  inject  and  store  the  nec-
essary volumes to make this a commercial technology to mitigate future greenhouse
gas emissions.

DOE has shown that adequate capacity exists through the United States to store
hundreds  of  years  of  future  emissions  and  additional  geographic  regions  will  be  in-
corporated into the DOE assessment by the end of Phase III of the Regional Carbon
Sequestration Partnerships Program.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski
Q1. Is  the  $79  million  request  for  carbon  sequestration  enough  to  ensure  that  the
proposed FutureGen plant can be constructed with this necessary technology? Do
you  believe  DOE  is  allocating  enough  resources  and  moving  quickly  enough  to
develop this crucial technology that will lead to reducing our emissions of CO2?
A1. The  FutureGen  Project,  as  part  of  its  site  selection,  has  conducted  initial  site
characterization of the geologic formations that will store the CO2 generated during
its  operation.  The  plant  is  schedule  to  be  operational  in  2012.  The  $86  million  in
the  2008  Budget  (including  $7  million  of  R&D  by  federal  employees  under  the  Pro-
gram Direction line item), plus the $105 million in the 2007 Operations Plan under
the Continuing Resolution (including $5 million of R&D by federal employees under
the  Program  Direction  line  item)  is  sufficient  funding  to  complete  NEPA  activities
for four Large Volume Deployment Tests by FY 2008 and also for its Core Program
to  continue  with  development  of  Monitoring,  Mitigation,  and  Verification  (MMV)
and  other  relevant  technologies.  With  these  activities,  the  sequestration  technology
should  be  advance  enough  to  be  part  of  FutureGen  and  also  utilize  FutureGen  for
technology verification.

DOE  has  accelerated  four  Large-Volume  Deployment  Tests  in  coordination  with
the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships. Funding from FY 2007 will be uti-
lized to initiate these tests so that starting at the end of FY 2007 and through 2008
the DOE will complete National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) activities and ini-
tiate  four  large  volume  sequestration  tests.  This  will  include  the  site  characteriza-
tion  and  infrastructure  development  for  storage  projects  that  will  inject  up  to  one
million tons for CO2 per year for several years.
