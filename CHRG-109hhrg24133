WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2005

11:00 A.M.–1:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  October  26,  2005,  at  11  a.m.,  the  House  Committee  on  Science  will  hold  a
hearing  on  the  key  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  National  Institute  of
Standard and Technology’s (NIST) investigation into the collapse of the World Trade
Center (WTC), how building and fire code organizations plan to implement the rec-
ommendations contained in that report, and what barriers exist to the development
and adoption of stronger building and fire codes.

Witnesses

The following witnesses will address the Committee:

Panel I:
Ms.  Sally  Regenhard,  Skyscraper  Safety  Campaign  (SSC),  New  York,  NY.  The
SSC  represents  families  and  survivors  of  the  WTC  disaster  and  supports  stronger
codes and practices for buildings and first responders.

Panel II:
Dr. William Jeffrey, Director, National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Ms. Nancy McNabb, Director  of  Government  Affairs,  National  Fire  Protection  As-
sociation  (NFPA).  NFPA  standards  are  extensively  referenced  in  the  NIST  rec-
ommendations on the WTC collapse.
Dr.  James  R.  Harris,  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  (ASCE).  ASCE  stand-
ards are extensively referenced in the NIST recommendations on the WTC collapse.
Mr.  Henry  L.  Green,  President,  International  Code  Council  (ICC).  The  ICC  is  an
association of State and local code officials, building mangers, and other parties that
collectively  maintain  the  International  Building  Code  (IBC),  the  most  widely  used
model  building  code  in  the  U.S.  Many  of  NIST’s  recommendations  reference  the
IBC.
Mr. Glenn Corbett, Assistant Professor of Fire Science, John Jay College of Crimi-
nal  Justice,  New  York,  NY.  Mr.  Corbett  is  a  member  of  NIST’s  National  Construc-
tion Safety Team Advisory Board.

Overarching Questions

The hearing will address the following overarching questions:

1. What  are  the  most  important  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  World

Trade Center Investigation report?

2. Are  the  NIST  recommendations  framed  appropriately  so  that  they  can  be

adopted into national model building codes?

3. What are the prospects for the adoption of the recommendations by the code
organizations?  What  is  NIST  doing  to  promote  this  process?  What  are  the
possible impediments to their adoption?

4. What  lessons  were  learned  from  this  investigation  that  could  be  applied  to

improve future investigations of building failures?

Background

4

On September 11, 2001, terrorists crashed two fuel-laden Boeing 767s into World
Trade Center (WTC) Tower 1 and Tower 2. While both 110-story buildings withstood
the  initial  impact,  the  subsequent  fires  weakened  the  already  damaged  columns  at
the periphery and core of the towers, both of which collapsed. More than 25,000 peo-
ple were safely evacuated from the towers, however 2,749 people were killed in the
disaster.  World  Trade  Center  7,  a  47-story  office  building  located  adjacent  to  WTC
1 and 2, was damaged during the disaster and collapsed later that same day.

Immediately  following  the  attack,  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency
(FEMA)  and  the  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  (ASCE)  began  planning  a
building performance study of the WTC. The week of October 7, as soon as the res-
cue and search efforts ceased, an ASCE team under contract with FEMA known as
the  Building  Performance  Assessment  Team  (BPAT)  went  to  the  site  and  began
their  assessment  of  why  the  buildings  had  failed.  This  was  to  be  a  brief  effort,  as
the  study  team  consisted  of  experts  who  generally  had  volunteered  their  time.  In
January  2002,  FEMA  asked  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology
(NIST)  to  take  over  the  next  phase  of  the  investigation  of  the  collapse  essentially
to  build  upon  the  BPAT  recommendations  and  conduct  a  more  thorough  investiga-
tion of the events leading to the collapse.

The  Science  Committee  held  two  hearings  in  2002  on  the  WTC  collapse,  one  on
March  6  and  the  other  on  May  1.  The  March  6,  2002,  hearing  focused  on  how  the
Federal Government investigates catastrophic building failures, and what had been
learned  from  the  collapse  of  the  WTC  1,  2  and  7.  Concerns  raised  at  the  hearing
included  the  lack  of  any  specific  federal  authority,  protocols,  or  funding  for  inves-
tigations  of  this  kind.  Concerns  were  also  raised  regarding  the  timing  of  the  BPAT
deployment (almost a month after the towers fell), its access to the site and building
records, premature disposal of evidence, and FEMA’s lack of regular communication
with the public about the investigation.

The BPAT released its report at the May 2002 hearing. The hearing also reviewed
plans for NIST to begin a more comprehensive investigation in view of the criticisms
of FEMA, and provided a forum to discuss proposed legislation to give NIST the au-
thorities  necessary  to  conduct  such  an  investigation.  The  BPAT  report  highlighted
potential reasons for why the two towers, almost identical in design, performed dif-
ferently  under  the  stresses  of  the  disaster.  It  also  identified  critical  features  that
enabled so many to evacuate, and the design elements that may have played a role
in  the  collapse  and  prevented  people  above  the  impacts  from  being  able  to  exit  the
buildings.  However,  witnesses  commented  that,  without  a  more  sophisticated  anal-
ysis of the evidence, no conclusions could be drawn that could be used to recommend
improvements in building and fire codes to prevent future loss of life.

Also at the May 2002 hearing, the witnesses commented favorably on draft legis-
lation  being  prepared  by  the  Science  Committee,  based  on  the  authorizing  legisla-
tion  for  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  (NTSB)  to  enhance  NIST’s  exist-
ing  authority  to  investigate  building  failures.  On  May  9,  2002,  the  National  Con-
struction  Safety  Team  Act  (NCST—H.R.  4687)  was  introduced  by  Congressman
Sherwood  Boehlert  and  Congressman  Anthony  Weiner.  The  NCST  was  signed  into
law  on  October  1,  2002.  Under  the  Act,  NIST  is  authorized  to  appoint  a  national
construction safety team to determine the causes of a building’s failure, evaluate the
technical  aspects  of  evacuation  and  emergency  response,  and  ‘‘recommend,  as  nec-
essary,  specific  improvements  to  building  standards,  codes,  and  practices  based  on
the  findings,’’  and  propose  any  research  needed  to  improve  building  safety  and
emergency  response  procedures.’’  The  law  gives  NIST  subpoena  power  to  ensure
that it has access to all evidence to support an investigation, but the results of such
investigations cannot be used as evidence in any subsequent litigation.

On August 21, 2002, NIST announced the appointment of a national construction
safety  team  to  investigate  building  and  fire  safety  in  WTC  1,  2,  and  7.  The  project
was funded through FEMA, and cost $16 million.
Building and Fire Codes

Building  and  fire  codes  are  established  and  enforced  by  State  and  local  govern-
ments,  which  generally  base  their  codes  on  national  model  codes  that  are  written
by  private  non-profit  standards  development  organizations  (SDOs).  These  organiza-
tions are generally are made up of members—individuals and groups—that have an
interest  in  construction.  Generally  make  their  money  through  membership  pay-
ments and selling their codes.

Building  and  fire  codes  and  standards  are  technical  descriptions  of  constructions,
materials, installations, equipment, or practices designed to achieve specific results,
such as safety or strength. Standards are very specific guidelines that describe sin-
gle elements of construction or safety. For example, a ‘‘fire rating’’ is a standard that

describes the amount of time a construction element such as a beam can be exposed
to  a  typical  fire  before  it  breaks  or  fails.  Other  examples  of  building  standards  in-
clude  hallway  or  stairwell  widths  deemed  necessary  to  evacuate  a  certain  number
of people in a certain amount of time, or the type of steel needed for a beam to sup-
port a certain amount of weight. NIST does not write building or fire codes, but does
participate  in  the  discussions  and  provides  technical  guidance  to  the  standards  de-
velopment organizations.

The  most  widely-used  model  building  code  in  the  U.S.  is  the  International  Build-
ing  Code  (IBC).  It  is  currently  the  basis  of  the  codes  in  45  states  and  the  District
of  Columbia.  The  IBC  is  developed  and  owned  by  the  International  Code  Council
(ICC). The ICC’s members consist of State and local building code officials, building
owners  and  managers,  and  private  sector  participants  from  construction  and  other
industries.  ICC’s  members  are  concerned  with  safety,  but  also  with  cost  and  other
economic  considerations,  and  these  are  reflected  in  the  outcomes  of  the  code  meet-
ings. The IBC is regularly updated in a deliberative, committee-driven process that
takes  about  eighteen  months.  The  deadline  for  submitting  proposed  changes  to  the
IBC, which begins the next eighteen-month cycle, is March 24th, 2006.

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), which develops many standards
related  to  fire  safety,  recently  produced  an  alternative  model  building  code,  NFPA
5000.  Experts  say  that  implementing  NFPA  5000  may  be  more  expensive  than  the
IBC  but  may  result  in  a  greater  level  of  safety.  NFPA’s  membership  is  different
from that of the ICC, with strong representation by fire protection officials and fire
equipment  manufacturers.  NFPA  5000  has  not  been  widely  adopted,  but  individual
NFPA standards are widely used in fire codes.
The NIST Investigation

NIST’s Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) carries out research in fire
science, fire safety, structural, mechanical, and environmental engineering. It is the
only federal laboratory dedicated to research on building design and fire safety.

The goals of the NIST WTC investigation of the WTC disaster were to investigate
the building construction, the materials used, and the technical conditions that con-
tributed to the outcome of the WTC disaster to serve as the basis for:

and used;

• Improvements  in  the  way  buildings  are  designed,  constructed,  maintained,
• Improved  tools  and  guidance  for  industry  and  safety  officials  for  safer  build-
• Recommended  revisions  to  current  building  codes,  standards,  and  practices,
• Improved public safety.

ings and better coordination in emergencies;

and

The specific objectives were to:

1) Determine  why  and  how  WTC  1  and  WTC  2  collapsed  following  the  initial

impacts of the aircraft;

2) Determine  why  the  injuries  and  fatalities  were  so  high  or  low  depending  on
location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior,
evacuation, and emergency response;

3) Assess what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction,

operation, and maintenance of WTC 1, 2; and

4) Identify  areas  in  current  building  and  fire  codes,  standards,  and  practices

that warrant revision.

To meet these goals, NIST assembled a team of in-house experts and outside spe-
cialists,  totaling  about  200  people.  The  team  compiled  and  reviewed  tens  of  thou-
sands  of  documents,  photographs,  and  films,  interviewed  over  a  thousand  people
who had been on the scene or who had been involved with the design, construction,
and maintenance of the WTC; analyzed 236 pieces of steel taken from the wreckage;
performed  laboratory  tests,  and  performed  computer  simulations  of  the  sequence  of
events that happened from the instant of the aircraft impact to the initiation of col-
lapse  for  each  tower.  In  addition,  NIST  held  several  public  meetings  in  New  York
City to report on the status of the investigation and solicit comments and additional
information that might further the investigation.

In  September,  2005,  NIST  released  its  draft  Final  Report  of  the  National  Con-
struction  Safety  Team  on  the  Collapse  of  the  World  Trade  Center  Towers  for  public
comment.  A  copy  of  the  executive  summary  of  the  report  is  attached.  This  report
summarizes  the  findings  of  the  investigation  and  includes  thirty  recommendations
to  improve  the  safety  of  tall  buildings,  occupants,  and  emergency  responders.  NIST
will publish its final report within the next two weeks.

NIST Findings

The  NIST  investigation  confirmed  and  expanded  upon  several  of  the  findings  by
the  initial  FEMA  BPAT  study.  When  built,  WTC  1  and  WTC  2  were  unlike  any
other skyscrapers in existence at the time, both in terms of their height and innova-
tive  structural  features.  These  consisted  of  a  ‘‘frame-tube’’  system  of  exterior  col-
umns  on  the  four  faces  of  the  towers,  linked  to  a  core  of  columns  by  light-weight
trusses  that  supported  the  floors.  In  spite  of  their  innovative  design,  WTC  1  and
2 met or exceeded the requirements of the New York City building codes.

The  NIST  investigation  determined  that  although  the  aircraft  did  considerable
damage  to  the  principal  structural  components  of  WTC  1  and  2,  the  towers  were
inherently  robust,  and  would  have  remained  standing  were  it  not  for  the  dislodged
fireproofing  which  exposed  the  central  columns  to  the  multi-floor  fires.  In  each
tower, a different combination of impact damage and heat-weakened structural com-
ponents  contributed  to  the  abrupt  structural  collapse.  The  fire  safety  systems  in
WTC  1  and  2  met  or  exceeded  current  practice  at  the  time  the  towers  fell,  but
played  no  safety  role  on  September  11th  because  the  water  supplies  and  electrical
systems  were  damaged  by  the  aircraft  impact.  In  WTC  1,  the  aircraft  destroyed  all
escape routes, and 1,355 people were trapped in the upper floors when the building
collapsed.  In  WTC  2  where  evacuation  had  already  commenced,  about  3,000  got
below  the  impact  zone  before  the  second  plane  crashed.  One  stairwell  remained
passable  for  a  short  period  of  time  and  eighteen  people  evacuated  through  the  im-
pact  zone.  The  remaining  619  people  perished.  WTC  2  collapsed  before  WTC  1  be-
cause  the  aircraft  did  significantly  more  damage  to  the  central  columns  and  the
fires were concentrated on the East side of the building, rather than moving around
as they did in WTC 1.
Major Issues Addressed in the NIST WTC Recommendations

NIST’s recommendations fall into eight groups:

• Increased Structural Integrity,
• Enhanced Fire Resistance of Structures
• New Methods for Fire Resistance Design of Structures
• Improved Active Fire Protection
• Improved Building Evacuation
• Improved Emergency Response
• Improved Procedures and Practices, and Education and Training.

These  recommendations  include  many  references  to  specific  SDOs  to  modify  or,
in some cases, completely overhaul those standards that apply to building construc-
tion,  evacuation,  testing,  and  fire  safety.  NIST’s  recommendations  also  refer  to  less
specific  audiences  such  as  building  managers,  building  occupants,  property  devel-
opers, and first responders to develop procedures and best practices to protect build-
ing occupants.

The  following  highlights  some  of  the  key  issues  referenced  by  NIST  in  its  rec-

ommendations:
• Increased Structural Integrity

The  NIST  investigators  found  that  the  existing  methods  of  calculating  the  effect
of  wind  and  other  stressors  on  tall  towers  produced  markedly  different  results
among the different tests, leading them to question whether these tests had a basis
in  fact  and  needed  to  be  re-designed.  NIST’s  report  also  focuses  on  the  concept  of
‘‘progressive  collapse,’’  where  the  weakening  of  one  structural  element  contributes
to the weakening of others. NIST raises the question of whether the current practice
of  testing  individual  building  components  such  as  columns  and  floor  trusses  gives
an  accurate  estimate  of  the  resilience  of  an  entire  building  assembly  to  fire,  wind,
and  other  stressors.  NIST  recommends  that  a  ‘‘structural  frame’’  approach  to  fire
resistance  ratings  be  developed  by  the  structural  standards  groups  such  as  ASCE.
However, progressive collapse is not well understood, and it may take time for these
groups  to  produce  a  standard  and  describe  the  appropriate  tests  against  which  to
judge whether structures are prone to progressive collapse.

The  recommendations  pertaining  to  structural  integrity  and  design  are  directed
largely at ASCE–7, and specifications developed by the American Concrete Institute
(ACI)  and  the  American  Institute  of  Steel  Construction  (AISC),  as  well  as  NFPA,
and  urge  that  the  latest  version  of  these  standards  and  specifications  be  adopted
by the ICC and NFPA into their model building codes.
• Improved Fire Resistance of Structures and Fire Protection

Over  the  years,  across  the  United  States,  there  has  been  a  gradual  reduction  in
rigor of building codes of fire rating requirements, i.e., how long something such as
a steel column can remain exposed to a fire before breaking or deforming. There has
also been a decrease in the compartmentalizing requirements for working and living
spaces.  Large  compartments  in  buildings  allow  more  air  to  flow  to  fires  and  allow
fires  to  spread  faster.  Large  compartments,  however,  means  more  floor  area,  more
tenants,  and  more  rent  for  the  building  owner.  A  lower  fire  rating  requirement  al-
lows  the  use  of  lighter  and  less  material  in  construction.  The  loosening  of  these  re-
strictions  has  been  compensated  for  by  increasing  requirements  for  sprinkler  sys-
tems,  which  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  quenching  typical  office  fires.  On
September  11th  however,  the  sprinkler  systems  were  disabled,  and  even  in  typical
fires, sprinkler systems do not always work. NIST recommends greater redundancy
in  sprinkler  systems,  and  more  compartmentalization  to  restrict  air  flow  to  fires.
These recommendations apply to several standards developed by NFPA.

The  reduction  in  fire  ratings  has  also  been  compensated  by  the  use  of  spray-ap-
plied  fire  resistive  materials  (SFRM)  on  structural  components.  This  was  the  foam
that  was  applied  to  the  columns  and  trusses  of  WTC  1  and  2  as  fireproofing.  After
the 1993 WTC terrorist bombing, it was recommended that the spray-on fire protec-
tion  on  the  steel  components  of  the  towers  be  thickened.  NIST  emphasizes  that,
were it not for the dislodging of the fireproofing from the structural steel when the
aircraft  flew  into  the  towers,  WTC  1  and  2  would  likely  have  withstood  the  subse-
quent  fires.  The  foam  on  WTC  1  and  2  was  shaken  or  blown  off  around  the  cores
and peripheral columns on several floors in both Towers on September 11th, mean-
ing  the  columns  reached  critical  temperatures  much  faster  then  they  would  have
normally. NIST recommends that the performance of this type of fireproofing needs
to be better understood, particularly its response to shock, aging, and method of ap-
plication, and new coatings should be developed.

NIST notes in its report that both the IBC and NFPA 5000 model building codes
have  since  changed  their  fire  rating  requirements  for  buildings  over  420  feet  from
two  hours  to  four.  The  report  also  says,  however,  that  the  technical  basis  for  fire
ratings is not strong, particularly since the typical contents of offices, and construc-
tion materials, have changed in the last 100 years. NIST recommends a comprehen-
sive review by all fire-related SDOs of fire testing procedures to ensure that fire rat-
ings  are  meaningful.  Structural  fire  resistance  is  closely  tied  to  the  outcomes  of
work  on  the  structural  frame  approach  for  large  buildings,  which  NIST  advocates
in  its  report  while  recommending  an  extensive  re-evaluation  by  national  building
code  committees  (ICC  and  NFPA)  of  the  dynamics  of  fire,  evacuation,  and  emer-
gency  response  for  skyscrapers  to  determine  what  fire  ratings  are  needed  for  tall
buildings.  In  the  case  of  re-evaluating  the  tests  steel  and  concrete  assemblies,  this
could be an expensive proposition. A typical full-scale fire test costs $30,000 or more
per test, and to validate a new test, experimental tests must to be run several times.
It is not clear who should be conducting these tests.
• Full Evacuation of Large Buildings

After  the  1993  terrorist  bombing  of  the  WTC  site,  it  took  four  hours  to  evacuate
everyone  from  WTC  1  and  WTC  2.  The  standard  evacuation  plan  for  skyscrapers
does not usually anticipate such a mass egress: fire-related evacuation plans assume
that occupants ‘‘evacuate in place’’ to higher and lower floors while first responders
fight  the  fire.  Although  this  approach  may  change  as  a  result  of  the  events  of  Sep-
tember  11th,  it  may  still  be  the  most  practical  and  safe  procedure  for  typical  sky-
scraper  fires.  Skyscraper  elevators  in  the  U.S.  are  not  generally  fireproof,  nor  are
they  intended  to  be  used  for  mass  evacuation.  Full  evacuation  via  stairwells  takes
a long time. On September 11th, with all elevators out of commission, it would have
taken  hours  for  firefighters  to  ascend  to  the  affected  floors  to  fight  the  fires,  or  as-
sist  survivors  down  the  stairs.  This  fact  has  provoked  some  re-thinking  of  how  ele-
vators should be designed and used for emergency purposes.

WTC  1  and  2  had  three  stairwells  each,  centered  at  the  core  of  the  buildings.
When  the  aircraft  crashed,  these  stairs  were  destroyed.  The  NIST  investigation
found that about six percent of the people in the towers had health problems or dis-
abilities that made taking the stairs difficult. Overall, it was found, people evacuate
buildings  twice  as  slowly  as  generally  thought.  NIST  recommends  structural  hard-
ening  of  elevators  for  use  in  large-scale  emergencies,  and  that  stairwells  be  spaced
further  apart,  although  it  does  not  say  by  how  much.  NIST  also  recommends  that
stairwells  should  be  widened  to  allow  more  people  to  descend  as  well  as  to  allow
counter flow from first responders going up the stairs. Most of the recommendations
apply  to  NFPA  101,  and  the  National  Model  Building  and  Fire  Codes  of  the  ICC.
• Communications and Emergency Response

For the approximately 1,000 emergency responders on the site on September 11th,
this  was  the  largest  disaster  they  had  ever  experienced.  Communications  networks
at  the  site  were  destroyed,  and  portable  communications  devices  such  as  walkie-
talkies  and  cellular  phones  were  overwhelmed  as  dozens  of  first  responders  at-
tempted  to  talk  at  the  same  time.  Walkie-talkies  performed  inadequately,  or  other-
wise  failed  to  function  inside  the  steel-concrete  construction  of  the  towers.  There
was  no  inter-operability  between  the  New  York  Police  Department  and  the  New
York  Fire  Department  equipment.  Although  there  had  been  significant  upgrades  to
the  fire  monitoring  and  communications  infrastructure  in  the  WTC  Complex  after
the  1993  terrorist  bombing,  incident  command  centers  established  inside  the  two
towers by first responders were still unable to provide a sufficient assessment of the
situation,  or  monitor  and  relay  information  to  other  first  responders  at  the  site  for
proper  coordination  of  their  activities.  First  responders  commented  later  that  view-
ers  watching  the  disaster  on  television  had  a  better  grasp  of  the  scope  and  nature
of the crisis than did anyone at the WTC site.

NIST’s recommendations on improved emergency response apply mostly to NFPA
standards, but also extend to the Department of Homeland Security, and state and
local  jurisdictions,  and  first  responders.  NIST  emphasizes  that  systems  need  to  be
effective  for  large-scale  emergencies  and  able  to  function  in  ‘‘challenging  radio  fre-
quency environments.’’ NIST also states that better procedures are needed for inte-
grating  information  from  multiple  sources  and  coordinating  a  unified  response
among different agencies and departments.
Additional Issues

• Follow-up funding is limited

In  many  instances,  NIST  has  recommended  research  and  testing  to  determine
whether  and  how  changes  in  building  codes  should  be  made.  It  is  not  clear  this  ef-
fort  will  receive  the  commitment  for  funding  it  requires.  In  order  to  implement
many  of  NIST’s  recommendations,  a  lot  of  research  and  collaboration  with  SDOs
and stakeholders will have to be done to provide a scientific and technical basis for
the  standards  changes  needed  to  meet  those  recommendations.  NIST  requested  $2
million  in  additional  funds  for  FY  2006  for  codes  and  practices  for  buildings  and
first  responders,  but  the  FY  2006  appropriation  has  not  yet  been  finalized.  If  ade-
quate funding for NIST’s research efforts is not provided, it is unclear what progress
will  be  made  on  implementing  those  recommendations  that  need  scientific  research
to be implemented.

• Future building investigations

It  is  unclear  what  role  NIST  will  play  in  investigating  future  building  failures.
FEMA  received  heavy  criticism  at  the  Science  Committee  hearing  March  6,  2002,
for  shortcomings  in  the  way  in  which  it  conducted  the  investigation  of  the  collapse
of  the  World  Trade  Center.  The  passage  of  the  National  Construction  Safety  Team
Act was supposed to address these shortcomings by creating the authority to inves-
tigate building failures at NIST and providing NIST with subpoena power to obtain
whatever evidence it needed to complete investigations. However, in the years since
September  11th,  although  several  building  failures  have  occurred,  Hurricane
Katrina  being  the  most  recent  event  causing  structural  failures,  NIST  has  not  in-
voked  the  NSTC  Act  to  launch  investigations,  but  rather  has  been  called  in  under
another agency: FEMA in the case of Katrina. NIST does not have a source of fund-
ing dedicated to pay for such activities and is apparently reluctant to act independ-
ently.  Outside  observers  note  that  NIST  is  a  research  institution  and  may  not  be
culturally suited to conduct investigations as does the NTSB, upon which the NCST
Act was based, or the Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Good  morning.  This  hearing  is  open,  and
we are pleased to welcome back one who strayed from the fold, Mr.
Weiner  of  New  York,  who  was  a  very  valued  Member  of  this  com-
mittee,  and  has  gone  onto  other  pursuits,  but  still,  fortunately,
within  the  Congress  of  the  United  States.  Mr.  Weiner,  welcome
back.

I want to welcome everyone to this important hearing, the Com-
mittee’s third on the tragic collapse of the World Trade Center. But
it won’t be our last. I want to promise and perhaps warn everyone
at the outset that this committee will be closely monitoring the fol-
lowup to the National Institute of Standards and Technology report
on the events of September 11.

That  means  we  will  be  watching  what  NIST  does,  what  other
federal  agencies  do,  and  what  the  code  writing  organizations  do.
We are obviously not technical experts, but we will be making sure
that  their  recommendations  are  considered  fully  and  thoroughly,
that  NIST  is  doing  everything  necessary  to  back  up  those  rec-
ommendations,  and  that  any  decisions  are  fully  justified  by  the
facts.

The issues raised in NIST’s report go far beyond a single horrific
terrorist  incident,  and  indeed,  beyond  terrorism  as  a  phenomenon.
The  report  raises  fundamental  questions  about  what  we  know
about  the  behavior  of  buildings  and  their  contents,  what  we  know
about the behavior of individuals in emergencies, and about wheth-
er  buildings  are  well  enough  designed  for  any  large  emergency.
This  is  not  about  making  every  building  strong  enough  to  survive
a plane crash.

That  said,  NIST’s  conclusion  that  the  Trade  Center  buildings
could have survived even the massive insult of a plane crash if the
fireproofing  had  remained  in  place,  is  at  once  both  chilling  and
promising,  chilling  because  the  massive  loss  of  life  was  not  inevi-
table, promising because it is an indication we can do more to pro-
tect lives in the future.

This  committee  will  be  asking  hard  questions  of  all  of  our  wit-
nesses  today,  to  make  sure  we  do  take  all  reasonable  steps  to  pro-
tect lives. We will be looking into whether NIST’s recommendations
are  written  in  a  way  that  will  facilitate  the  adoption  by  code
groups.  It  appears  that  they  do  not.  We  will  be  probing  whether
code  groups  are  prepared  to  fully  and  fairly  review  the  rec-
ommendations. On that, while the initial indications in today’s tes-
timony are promising, the jury necessarily is still out.

But our tough questions should not obscure the debt of gratitude
we  owe  to  NIST.  NIST  took  seriously  the  mandate  from  this  com-
mittee,  and  Mr.  Weiner,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  your  assistance
in that, and the Nation gave it in the National Construction Safety
Team  Act,  and  assembled  an  impressive  group  of  experts  that  pro-
duced  a  comprehensive  and  impressive  report.  But  our  focus  now
has to be on whether everyone is doing enough to translate the re-
port into specific, concrete steps that will prevent future tragedies.
The  protection  of  life  is  the  highest  responsibility  of  public  offi-
cials,  and  our  hearing  today  is  about  that  responsibility,  just  as
much  as  any  hearing  on  the  military  or  homeland  security  would
be. But the process in this case is far more complex, because of the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

22

way  it  involves  the  private  sector  and  every  level  of  government.
But complexity is not an excuse for inaction.

Before  I  turn  to  the  minority,  I  want  to  give  a  special  welcome
to Bill Jeffrey, who is making his first appearance before this com-
mittee.  I  say  first  public  appearance,  because  Dr.  Jeffrey  has  long
been  a  valued  advisor  to  this  committee  in  his  work  at  the  Office
of Science and Technology Policy, someone we have admired for his
intelligence, open-mindedness, and candor.

We could not be more delighted with his appointment as the Di-
rector  of  NIST,  and  we  very  much  look  forward  to  continuing  to
work  with  him.  Hopefully,  after  today,  he  will  still  feel  that  way
about us. This isn’t, perhaps, the topic any of us would have chosen
for  his  maiden  hearing,  but  there  is  none  of  greater  importance,
and this hearing underscores the importance of NIST and its need
for greater funding. But I won’t get started on that subject now; we
have more than enough to deal with today.

And  I  also  want  to  welcome  back  someone  who  has  been  so  in-
valuable  to  this  committee  as  counsel,  Sally  Regenhard,  Chair-
person of the Skyscraper Safety Committee. She is emotionally and
intellectually  involved  in  our  proceedings  in  so  many  different
ways, and she has been a source of strength and inspiration to us,
and  she  is  dogged  in  her  determination,  and  I  commend  her  for
that.  People  will  often  ask  me,  ‘‘When  you  go  to  Washington,  I  bet
you  meet  with  lobbyists.’’  And  I  say  ‘‘Sure,  I  meet  with  lobbyists.
Every  single  day.  Lobbyists  are  people  who  advocate  for  some-
thing.’’ And there is one of the best lobbyists in this town today in
Sally Regenhard. What she is advocating for involves the protection
of life.

So,  with  that,  let  me  turn  to  Mr.  Miller  for  any  statement  he
might  care  to  make,  and  then  we  will  have  our  first  panel  of  one,
Ms. Regenhard.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Boehlert follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  this  important  hearing,  this  committee’s  third  on
the  tragic  collapse  of  the  World  Trade  Center,  but  probably  not  our  last.  I  want  to
promise  (and  perhaps  warn)  everyone  at  the  outset  that  this  committee  will  be
closely  monitoring  the  follow-up  to  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Tech-
nology (NIST) report on the events of September 11.

That means we will be watching what NIST does, what other federal agencies do,
and what the code writing organizations do. We are obviously not technical experts,
but we will be making sure that the recommendations are considered fully and thor-
oughly, that NIST is doing everything necessary to back up those recommendations,
and that any decisions are fully justified by the facts.

The  issues  raised  in  NIST’s  report  go  far  beyond  a  single,  horrific  terrorist  inci-
dent, and indeed beyond terrorism as a phenomenon. The report raises fundamental
questions  about  what  we  know  about  the  behavior  of  buildings  and  their  contents,
what we know about the behavior of individuals in emergencies, and about whether
buildings are well enough designed for any large emergency. This is not about mak-
ing every building strong enough to survive a plane crash.

That said, NIST’s conclusion that the Trade Center buildings could have survived
even  the  massive  insult  of  a  plane  crash  if  the  fireproofing  had  remained  in  place
is at once both chilling and promising—chilling because the massive loss of life was
not inevitable; promising because it is an indication we can do more to protect lives
in the future.

We  could  not  be  more  delighted  with  his  appointment  as  the  Director  of  NIST,
and  we  very  much  look  forward  to  continuing  to  work  with  him.  Hopefully,  after
today,  he  will  still  feel  that  way  about  us.  This  isn’t  perhaps  the  topic  any  of  us
would  have  chosen  for  his  ‘‘maiden’’  hearing,  but  there  is  none  of  greater  impor-

tance. And this hearing underscores the importance of NIST, and its need for great-
er funding. But I won’t get started on that subject now; we have more than enough
to deal with today. Mr. Gordon.

Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to join Chairman

Boehlert in welcoming everyone to this morning’s hearing.

On the surface, today’s topic may sound dry and technical. How-
ever, what we are talking about here really is saving lives. The sole
purpose  of  the  National  Construction  Safety  Team  Act  is  to  save
lives  by  investigating  and  understanding  building  collapses,  and
then  improve  building  codes,  emergency  response,  and  evacuation
procedures.

The  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology’s,  NIST’s,
World  Trade  Center  investigation  and  their  recommendations  are
the first real result of the Act. The NIST report is a good first step,
but  really  a  lot  remains  to  be  done.  We  need  to  know  what  is  re-
quired  to  translate  these  NIST  recommendations  into  improved
buildings  and  emergency  response  and  evacuation  procedures.
Those changes will improve public safety, and otherwise, we would
have nothing to show, except another government report sitting on
a  shelf.  That  is  going  to  require  continued  oversight  by  this  com-
mittee as the process moves forward.

I also encourage the witnesses to give us their assessment of the
work that NIST has done during the last two years, and what they
think could be improved. And I want to mention that I am not only
interested  in  the  subject  from  the  Science  Committee  perspective,
but  also  how  it  relates  to  the  Terrorism  Risk  Insurance  Act,  TRIA,
which is now pending before the Financial Services Committee, and
whether  we  should  consider  the  NIST  recommendations  as  part  of
private sector preparedness, and how that affects TRIA.

Now,  I  would  like  to  yield  the  balance  of  my  time  to  a  former
Member  of  the  Science  Committee,  Anthony  Weiner.  Mr.  Weiner
has  no  small  interest  in  NIST’s  work  on  the  World  Trade  Center
investigation,  both  as  a  Member  from  New  York  City,  but  also,  he
was  the  co-author,  along  with  Chairman  Boehlert,  of  the  National
Construction Safety Team Act.
Mr. Weiner, welcome back.

ing.

I  want  to  join  Chairman  Boehlert  in  welcoming  everyone  to  this  morning’s  hear-

On the surface, today’s hearing topic may sound dry and technical. However, what
we’re really talking about is saving lives. The sole purpose of the National Construc-
tion  Safety  Team  Act  is  to  save  lives  by  investigating  and  understanding  building
collapses and then improve building codes, emergency response and evacuation pro-
cedures.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) World Trade Center
(WTC)  investigation  and  recommendations  are  the  first  case  of  implementation  of
the  Act.  The  NIST  report  is  a  good  first  step,  but  much  work  remains  to  be  done.
We need to know what is required to translate the NIST recommendations into im-
proved  building  codes,  and  emergency  response  and  evacuation  procedures.  It  is
these changes that will improve public safety, otherwise we will have nothing more
than  another  government  report  sitting  on  a  shelf.  This  will  also  require  continued
oversight by the Science Committee as the process moves forward.

I’m  also  encourage  the  witnesses  to  give  us  their  assessment  of  what  NIST  has
done  during  the  past  two  years  and  what  they  feel  could  be  improved.  I  also  want
to  mention  that  I’m  not  only  interested  in  this  subject  from  a  Science  Committee

perspective,  but  also  how  it  relates  to  Terrorism  Risk  Insurance  from  my  work  on
the Financial Services Committee.

Now  I  would  like  to  yield  the  balance  of  my  time  to  a  former  Member  of  the
Science Committee, Anthony Weiner. Rep. Weiner not only has a parochial interest
in the NIST’s WTC investigation, but he was a co-author, with Chairman Boehlert,
of the National Construction Safety Team Act.

Mr.  WEINER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Miller.  I  appreciate  it,  and  thank
you, Mr. Chairman, for continuing to keep the effort alive that was
one  of  the  ones  that  emerged  after  September  11  that  truly  drew
consensus  in  this  Congress.  I  want  to  welcome  back,  also,  Sally
Regenhard, who if it was the Boehlert-Weiner Bill, it really should
have  been  the  Boehlert-Weiner-Regenhard  Bill,  because  she  ac-
knowledged and called all of our attention to the notion that we all
agree  upon  now,  that  before  September  11  and  until  the  passage
of  this  legislation,  there  was  no  effort  by  government  to  do  any
kind  of  forensic  examination  of  why  buildings  collapse,  how  we
make  them  stronger,  and  how  we  make  sure  that  they  never  hap-
pen again.

That is just one of the things I think we agree upon at this point.
We also agree, and from learning, from reading the report and from
hearing  the  stories  of  those  that  were  inside,  and  those  that  were
engaged  in  the  largest  civic  rescue  in  our  nation’s  history,  there
were  some  tragic  flaws  in  the  design  of  the  World  Trade  Center.
There  were  also  some  remarkable  design  achievements  that  al-
lowed the buildings to stand despite remarkable stress.

But  we  also,  after  getting  the  report  back  now,  I  think  there  is
an  emerging  consensus  on  a  couple  of  other  issues  as  well.  One  is
that the study doesn’t go far enough. The study doesn’t include the
level of specificity that would truly make the report a handbook for
those  seeking  to  come  up  with  building  codes  in  the  future.  The
City of New York is involved in something it hasn’t done in a gen-
eration, which is rewriting its building codes. If I were to send this
report  to  the  City  of  New  York,  and  they  wanted  to  go  to  a  ref-
erence  and  say,  well,  how  do  we  follow  up  on  the  NIST  rec-
ommendation that we improve standards for fire resistance testing.
Is  there  a  standard  in  this  report?  And  the  answer  is  no.  If  they
want to follow up on the NIST recommendation that fire protection
and suppression redundancy be built into buildings, is there a spe-
cific  standard  that  they  can  take  from  this  report?  The  answer  is
no.  So,  I  think  that  we  have  fallen  short,  NIST  has  fallen  short  of
making  this  a  true  reference  manual  for  future  protection  of  big
buildings.  And  for  those  of  us  in  New  York  City  and  other  big  cit-
ies,  and  frankly,  even  medium  sized  cities  that  are  building  build-
ings of greater than twenty stories, it falls short.

And  I  also  think  something  else.  You  know,  we  in  government
have  a  certain  tolerance  for  the  slow  pace  of  things.  This  took  too
long.  It  took  too  long  for  NIST  to  produce  a  report  that  really
doesn’t  get  us  anywhere  past  the  50  yard  line  here.  We  are  not  in
the  Red  Zone.  We  are  not  getting  close  to  the  place  that  we  need
to  be.  And  I  am  prepared  to  introduce  legislation,  hopefully  with
the support of this committee and its great chairman, to say okay,
let  us  take  the  next  step.  Let  us  take  these  general  recommenda-
tions.  Let  us  take  the  general  forensic  examination  that  was  done
on  the  World  Trade  Center.  Let  us  take  the  general  propositions
that  are  suggested  herein.  Let  us  assume  they  are  correct,  but  let

25

us  take  the  next  step.  Let  us  produce  a  document  that  truly  has
some fairly specific standards. Let us incentivize, but not require—
I  don’t  believe  we  should  have  a  Federal  Buildings  Department—
that  incentivizes  cities,  states,  and  localities  to  adopt  these  things,
and also, allows families, allow legislators when considering things
like  TRIA  or  building  codes  in  Skokie,  Illinois  or  Brooklyn,  New
York,  to  have  a  reference  guide  that  they  can  use.  Only  then  will
the  true  goals  of  our  original  legislation  have  been  fulfilled,  and  I
think  that  that  is  something  that  we  should  point  towards  in  the
future.

And I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to sit in.
I want to thank all of the professionals at NIST. Mr. Jeffrey, I am
sure  by  now  you  have  gotten  to  know  the  Chairman.  You  and  I
haven’t  gotten  to  know  one  another.  I  am  sure  you  have  gotten  to
know  Members  of  this  committee.  You  would  be  wise  to  get  to
know  Sally  Regenhard  very  well,  because  whether  you  would  like
to  or  not,  you  are  going  to  have  a  very  big  file  with  her  name  on
it, and she has shown us one thing, you know, for those of us that
have lost loved ones, there are many ways that people express their
grief. The way Sally Regenhard and many of her friends and neigh-
bors  have  expressed  their  grief  is  by  making  sure  that  there  are
no  such  disasters  like  this  again  in  the  future,  and  doing  every-
thing we can to prevent it. That is something that Chairman Boeh-
lert  and  I  are  committed  to.  I  know  the  professionals  at  NIST  are
committed to that. Now we have to go and finally get that job done.

And I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  welcome  back,  and  just  let  me  say
how  pleased  I  am  that  you  are  finally  getting  to  meet  Dr.  Jeffrey,
because to know him is to like him, but more importantly, to know
what  he  is  all  about  and  his  mission  and  his  approach  to  the  job
is to know he is determined to follow through, as we are.

This  is  just  another  hearing.  This  is  not  the  final  chapter  in  a
drama  about  a  horrific  incident.  We  are  determined  to  follow
through, as is Dr. Jeffrey and the people at NIST working with the
National  Institute  of  Building  Sciences.  This  is,  by  no  means,  the
final chapter. This is another chapter, but we are determined to go
forward working together, and we welcome you back as part of the
team.

With that, let me present the first witness, and I—Dr. Ehlers.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  appreciate  you  calling
this hearing, and am very pleased to see the results that have been
achieved.  It  is  a  little  known  facet  of  NIST  responsibilities  to  do
this  sort  of  thing,  and  I  am  very  pleased  with  the  work  they  have
done. And I think is providing a very strong base on which to build
for the future.

I  want  to  thank  all  our  witnesses  for  coming  here  today.  In  par-
ticular, I want to congratulate Dr. Jeffrey, the new NIST Director,
on his first appearance before this committee, and on NIST’s latest
Nobel  Prize  for  Physics,  announced  this  month  to  Dr.  Jan  Hall,  a
former colleague from my days as a researcher at NIST’s Joint In-
stitute  for  Laboratory  Astrophysics,  better  known  as  JILA  at  the
University  of  Colorado.  And  I  have  known  Dr.  Hall  for  years,  and
he is certainly deserving of this honor. This increases Nobel Prizes
to  three,  demonstrating  that  NIST  continues  to  be  a  world  leader

in  research  and  theoretical  work.  I  might  also  add  that  now  that
a  physicist  is  heading  the  organization,  I  expect  the  output  of
Nobel  Prizes  will  increase,  and  so,  I  will  leave  that  to  you  as  a
challenge.  I  also  wanted  to  congratulate  Mr.  Henry  Green,  a  resi-
dent of my home State of Michigan, on his prestigious new position
as President of the International Code Council, and I have had the
pleasure of meeting with Mr. Green, and I am very impressed with
him  and  his  ability.  I  look  forward  to  great  things  from  him  and
his work on that Council.

The  National  Construction  Safety  Team  Act,  which  originated  in
this  committee,  gave  NIST  specific  authorities  necessary  to  com-
plete  the  monumental  task  of  understanding  the  collapse  of  the
World  Trade  Center  towers.  Today’s  hearing  will  give  the  Science
Committee  the  chance  to  learn  about  NIST’s  findings  and  rec-
ommendations,  and  obtain  comments  from  the  witnesses  about
these  recommendations  and  the  process  by  which  they  will  be  im-
plemented.

The publication of the NIST report may signal the end of the in-
vestigation  itself,  but  it  launches  a  new  phase  in  that  process
which  I  hope  will  result  in  safer  buildings.  NIST’s  recommenda-
tions  indicate  that  there  are  opportunities  to  make  buildings  safer
and  more  resilient  to  fires  and  other  incidents,  to  improve  evacu-
ation  routes  and  procedures,  and  to  improve  emergency  response.
However,  the  task  of  amending  the  building  codes  is  in  the  hands
of  the  private  sector  and  the  State  and  local  officials.  NIST’s  role
now  becomes  technical  advisor  to  the  code  development  process.
Congress  needs  to  understand  this  process,  and  must  support  the
research  and  testing  required  if  any  of  NIST’s  recommendations
are to become common practice. Congress also needs to understand
what  challenges  may  exist  in  implementing  NIST’s  recommenda-
tions. Finally, I hope we hear from NIST about how it plans to use
the  National  Construction  Safety  Team  Act  in  the  future,  because
I am certain we will have other occasions that this has to be called
into action.

I  want  to  thank  NIST  for  the  good  work  that  you  have  done.
Keep  this  up  as  we  continue  to  work  together  to  make  buildings
safer,  both  during  and  after  disasters.  I  will  have  to  apologize,  be-
cause  I  will  be  in  and  out  of  this  committee  meeting,  mostly  out,
because  I  have  two  other  committee  meetings  simultaneously,  and
we are marking up bills, so my presence is required for votes. And
I apologize to the Members testifying, the witnesses testifying, and
also to the Chairman, but I will be here as much as I can.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  now  that  you  are  making  some  ad-
missions,  in  the  interest  of  full  disclosure,  while  we  are  all  very
proud of that Nobel Prize in physics for NIST, in the interest of full
disclosure,  Dr.  Ehlers  is  a  physicist,  and  so,  he  is  particularly
proud.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good morning. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  discuss  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standard
and  Technology’s  (NIST)  investigation  into  the  collapse  of  the  World  Trade  Center
(WTC).

This  committee  has  held  two  hearings  in  2002  on  the  WTC  collapse  that  focused
on  how  the  Federal  Government  investigates  catastrophic  building  failures  and  the
lessons  learned  from  the  collapse.  Concerns  raised  at  the  hearing  included  the  lack
of any specific federal authority, protocols, or funding for investigations of any kind.
As we have learned from the catastrophic damages of Hurricane Katrina, coordina-
tion among federal agencies is critical for gauging our preparedness and responding
to  national  disasters.  In  order  to  address  these  concerns,  it  is  my  understanding
that  NIST  issued  a  draft  report  for  public  comment  that  summarizes  the  findings
of  the  investigation  and  includes  thirty  recommendations  to  improve  the  safety  of
tall  buildings,  occupants,  and  emergency  responders.  However,  for  NIST’s  plans  to
be  effective,  they  must  be  implemented  by  standards  organized  and  adopted  by
State  and  local  authorities  that  set  building  codes  and  standards.  I  want  to  know
how  NIST  intends  to  implement  its  research  and  recommendations  for  improved
building codes, emergency response and evacuation procedures.
I welcome our witnesses and look forward to their testimony.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
The  events  of  September  11,  2001,  changed  our  lives  forever.  That  day  changed

how we Americans prepare ourselves against terrorism.

Building  codes  and  safety  regulations  play  a  critical  role  during  a  disaster—nat-
ural  or  otherwise.  Smart  construction  can  mean  the  difference  between  life  and
death.

During  an  attack,  the  weight  of  collapsing  building  materials  and  heat  of  fire

challenge even the best building designs.

The  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  has  come  today  to  report  on
its findings and recommendations following its investigation into the collapse of the
World Trade Center.

I hope today’s discussion will underscore this key report and help the Committee
understand  how  building  and  fire  code  organizations  plan  to  implement  the  rec-
ommendations contained in that report.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Ranking  Member,  thank  you  for  hosting  this  important

hearing.

I  am  eager  to  learn  more  about  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Tech-
nology report recommendations. The World Trade Center collapse was a horrific epi-
sode for our nation and this report is another appropriate measure that revisits the
events and permits us to learn from the tragedy.

Building safety and emergency evacuation are issues that go well beyond the sub-
ject of terrorism. This terrible hurricane season is demonstrating all too well the ef-
fect natural disasters have on man-made structures and our communities.

I  represent  a  congressional  district  in  St.  Louis  City  that  runs  south  along  the
Mississippi  river.  Our  region  is  near  the  New  Madrid  earthquake  center,  which
struck  the  area  from  1811  to  1812.  These  sequences  are  the  most  powerful  earth-
quakes  ever  to  have  been  felt  on  the  North  American  continent.  The  New  Madrid
Fault  System  remains  a  threat  to  our  region,  and  thus,  I  am  eager  to  learn  more
about  the  steps  our  community  needs  to  take  to  better  prepare  our  structures  for
a possible earthquake.

To  the  multiple  witnesses  that  appear  before  us  today,  thank  you  for  your  time

and your efforts. I look forward to hearing your testimony.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

In  looking  at  what  are  the  next  steps  in  terms  of  building  codes  and  building
structures  and  integrity,  we  must  unfortunately  review  what  took  place  on  that
dreadful  day  know  as  September  11th.  Like  most  building  collapses,  these  events
were  the  result  of  a  combination  of  factors.  While  the  buildings  were  able  to  with-
stand  the  initial  impact  of  the  aircraft,  the  resulting  fires  that  spread  through  the
towers weakened support columns and floors that had fireproofing dislodged by the
impacts.  This  eventually  led  to  collapse  as  the  perimeter  columns  were  pulled  in-
ward  by  the  sagging  floors  and  buckled.  According  to  reports,  each  aircraft  severed
perimeter columns, damaged interior core columns and knocked off fireproofing from
steel as the planes penetrated the buildings. The weight carried by the severed col-
umns  was  distributed  to  other  columns.  Subsequently,  fires  began  that  were  initi-
ated by the aircraft’s jet fuel but were fed for the most part by the building contents
and the air supply resulting from breached walls and fire-induced window breakage.
These  fires,  in  combination  with  the  dislodged  fireproofing,  were  responsible  for  a
chain of events in which the building core weakened and began losing its ability to
carry  loads.  The  floors  weakened  and  sagged  from  the  fires,  pulling  inward  on  the
perimeter columns. Floor sagging and exposure to high temperatures caused the pe-
rimeter  columns  to  bow  inward  and  buckle—a  process  that  spread  across  the  faces
of the buildings which as a result caused the entire structure to collapse.

As  a  Member  of  the  Committee  on  Homeland  Security,  I  am  very  interested  in
hearing the testimony of our witnesses today. While there have been many theories,
no  one  really  knows  when,  where  and  if  another  terrorist  attack  will  take  place.  It
is  due  to  this  uncertainty  that  we  must  do  our  best  to  be  prepared  in  all  possible
aspects  of  homeland  security.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  September  20,  2005
report  released  by  NIST  includes  a  detailed  technical  analysis  of  the  root  causes  of
the  building  failures  as  well  recommendations  to  improve  the  safety  of  tall  build-
ings, occupants and emergency responders. I believe these recommendations fall into
eight  categories  of  thirty  recommendations.  Loosely  categorized  these  are:  1)  in-
creased structural integrity, 2) enhanced fire resistance of structures, 3) new meth-
ods  for  fire  resistance  design,  4)  improved  active  fire  protection,  5)  improved  build-
ing evacuation procedures, 6) improved emergency response, 7) improved procedures
and practices in the design, construction and operation of buildings; and 8) upgrad-
ing the education/training of building and fire safety professionals. In closing, I look
forward  to  the  statements  and  recommendations  of  our  witnesses  as  they  lay  out
a road map as to how to protect our nation’s structures.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS MOORE

More  than  four  years  after  the  devastating  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,
2001,  we  still  remember  too  well  the  horrible  images  of  that  morning:  the  citizens
of  New  York  and  Washington  D.C.  running  in  fear  and  confusion  from  the  site  of
the  attacks,  firemen  and  other  safety  personnel  bravely  ushering  men  and  women
out of harms way, and the skeletal remains of the Twin Towers silhouetted against
the bright September sky.

Within  hours  of  the  attacks  themselves,  the  Twin  Towers  collapsed,  killing  thou-

sands of individuals trapped inside.

While there were many factors that contributed to the catastrophic loss of human
life  our  country  suffered  on  9/11,  an  issue  that  demands  careful  scrutiny  by  this
committee is the circumstances that contributed to the collapse of the Towers them-
selves.

As co-chair of the Congressional Hazards Caucus, ensuring that our buildings are
properly  designed  and  constructed  to  handle  destructive  forces,  whether  they  are
terrorist attacks, hurricanes, or tornadoes is of utmost importance to me.

I appreciate the willingness of the panel to share their opinions with the Members
of the Science Committee on the findings of the National Institute of Standard and
Technology’s  (NIST)  report  on  the  collapse  of  the  World  Trace  Center  and  look  for-
ward to working with you in the future to ensure the continued safety and security
of not only our buildings, but of the American people.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Now,  with  that,  and  no  further  opening
statements,  let  me  present,  welcome  back  to  the  Committee,  Ms.
Sally Regenhard, Chairperson of the Skyscraper Safety Committee.
Ms.  Regenhard,  the  floor  is  yours,  and  she  will  have  a  very  inter-
esting statement, and so much of the commentary in her statement
will lead us to provide questions to the panel that will follow.

So, Ms. Regenhard, the floor is yours.

Panel I:

STATEMENT OF SALLY REGENHARD, CHAIRPERSON,

SKYSCRAPER SAFETY CAMPAIGN

Ms.  REGENHARD.  Okay.  Thank  you.  Good  morning,  Chairman
Boehlert and Members of the House Science Committee. It is truly
an honor and a privilege to address you today.

I must first begin by thanking Chairman Sherwood Boehlert and
this  committee  for  listening  with  compassion  and  concern  to  the
families  of  the  victims  of  9/11.  When  we  first  came  here  in  March
and May of 2002, we were desperately seeking leadership for an in-
vestigation  of  what  happened  to  our  loved  ones  on  9/11.  We  had
sought  this  on  the  local  level  in  New  York  City,  but  found  no  one
to  help  us  answer  the  painful  questions  regarding  what  happened
to  our  loved  ones  in  the  World  Trade  Center  on  that  dreaded  day
of infamy.

Chairman  Boehlert  and  the  Science  Committee,  you  have  re-
deemed our belief in the system, and renewed our faith in the proc-
ess  of  representative  government  in  our  beloved  country,  and  for
this,  we  profoundly  thank  you.  The  families  of  the  victims  as  well
as  the  American  public  remain  in  your  debt  for  your  efforts  in  au-
thorizing  a  WTC  investigation  through  the  National  Construction
Safety Team Act.

I  must  also  begin  by  thanking  NIST  for  interacting  with  us  on
a  regular  basis  over  the  past  three  years,  via  conference  calls  and
meetings, with myself and my SSC co-chair, Monica Gabrielle, who
is  out  of  the  country  and  cannot  be  here  today.  I  know  that  it  has
not always been easy to deal with me and with other victims’ fami-

lies,  but  I  appreciate  the  tolerance  and  respect  shown  to  us  by
NIST. I also appreciate the vast technical research abilities of this
organization  and  the  enormous  task  of  embarking  upon  the  WTC
investigation.

In  totality,  however,  while  some  very  valuable  results  were
achieved,  the  overall  mode  and  findings  of  the  investigation  was
not  what  I  had  hoped  for.  I  had  certain  hopes  regarding  NIST  in
the investigation, but I and others were somewhat disillusioned re-
garding  what  NIST  was  willing  and  able  to  do.  I  had  hoped  for
more  specific  and  comprehensive  recommendations  that  could  eas-
ily be translated into code reform and change, but this was not the
case.  The  recommendations,  I  feel,  are  very  general  and  lack  spe-
cifics.  I  feel  that  the  vagueness  of  the  language  was  influenced  by
a  need  for  political  correctness  and  a  general  reluctance  or  an  in-
ability to investigate, use subpoena power, lay blame, or even point
out the deadly mistakes of 9/11 in the World Trade Center.

The  following  are  five  areas  of  concern  of  the  Skyscraper  Safety
Campaign,  and  these  concerns  have  been  compiled  by  input  from
my professional advisors, as well as my own experience during the
last four years.

The first area of concern is the role of the Port Authority of New
York  and  New  Jersey  and  its  exemptions  from  immunities  and
codes. The failure of the NIST investigation to comprehensively ex-
amine  what  role  these  immunities  played  in  the  design,  construc-
tion,  maintenance,  and  ultimate  collapse  of  the  World  Trade  Cen-
ter, is of great concern to me.

Secondly,  the  lack  of  more  intense  emphasis  on  the  fireproofing
issues, the premature disposal of the steel evidence, the heavy reli-
ance  on  computer  modeling  for  the  fire  testing,  and  the  reluctance
to  focus  on  cause,  blame,  and  resultant  implications  are  troubling
to us.

Number  three,  the  reliance  on  the  voluntary  cooperation  of  key
figures  in  the  investigation  to  provide  needed  information,  putting
the  WTC  chief  structural  engineer  on  the  payroll  to  facilitate  his
involvement in the investigation, utilizing researchers to the exclu-
sion  of  true  investigators  going  into  the  field  to  obtain  evidence  is
also  problematic  to  me.  On  this  last  point,  I  want  to  note  that  I
have  been  married  to  an  NYPD  detective  sergeant  for  over  30
years,  and  I  can  recognize  an  investigation  when  I  see  one.  I  feel
the  inherent  character  of  the  NIST  as  a  research  rather  than  an
investigative agency was a factor in this situation.

Number four, the lack of focus on evacuation issues of the World
Trade  Center,  such  as  the  remoteness  of  the  exits,  the  behavior  of
fleeing  persons  in  the  stairwells,  and  the  avoidance  of  first  person
accounts  of  stairwell  evacuation,  and  the  length  of  time  it  took  to
evacuate the building was a shortcoming.

Finally,  the  relative  secrecy  of  the  investigation  and  the  with-
holding  of  all  materials  and  documents  used  by  NIST  to  arrive  at
the  study’s  conclusions  is  very  disturbing.  These  materials  should
be made available to professionals to further study and to analyze,
and  to  question  and  verify  the  findings  according  to  the  scientific
method.  And  they  should  not  be  locked  away  in  the  National  Ar-
chives  or  anywhere  else.  I  certainly  hope  that  I  could  call  on  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

31

Science  Committee  to  help  unlock  this  information  for  the  Amer-
ican public in the future.

In conclusion, for these and for other reasons, I feel that govern-
ment  must  take  a  larger  role  in  developing  stronger  codes  and
standards  for  building  and  public  safety,  by  being  a  true  resource
to the code industry. Government representatives should be part of
code  writing  groups,  to  provide  advice  and  guidance,  and  to  help
develop  standards  and  practices.  As  it  stands  now,  it  is  largely  a
battle  of  the  do-gooders,  like  me  and  the  Skyscraper  Safety  Advi-
sors,  versus  the  business  interests,  in  a  never-ending  conflict  re-
garding  public  safety.  The  NIST  investigation  should  not  be  an
end. It should be just the beginning of a new era, in which we see
the  real  and  meaningful  role  that  government  must  play  in  the
safety  and  wellbeing  of  the  American  people.  In  addition  to  the
laudable  creation  of  the  National  Construction  Safety  Team  Act,
this  participation  can  be  an  additional  legacy  for  the  innocent  vic-
tims  of  9/11,  including  my  beautiful  son,  Probationary  Firefighter
Christian Michael Otto Regenhard, whose godmother is holding his
picture here today. He continues to be the inspiration for the work
and the accomplishments of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign.

I  thank  you  all  for  this  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  today.  God

bless you all in your work.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SALLY REGENHARD

Good morning Chairman Boehlert and Members of the House Science Committee.
It  is  truly  an  honor  and  a  privilege  to  address  you  today.  I  must  first  begin  by

Chairman Boehlert and the Science Committee redeemed our belief in the system,
and  renewed  our  faith  in  the  process  of  representative  government  in  our  beloved
country, and for this, we profoundly thank you. The families of the victims, as well

The  following  are  five  areas  of  concern  for  the  Skyscraper  Safety  Campaign:
(While  I  have  an  understanding  of  these  issues  in  concept,  for  answers  to  specific,
technical  questions,  I  would  like  to  confer  with  two  of  my  technical  advisors  who
are with me here today.)

1) The role of the Port Authority of NYNJ and its’ exemptions from immunities
and codes. The failure of the NIST Investigation to comprehensively examine

what  role  these  immunities  had  in  the  design,  construction,  maintenance
and ultimate collapse of the WTC is of great concern to me.

2) The lack of more intense emphasis on fireproofing issues, premature disposal
of  steel  evidence,  the  heavy  reliance  on  computer  modeling  for  fire  testing,
and  the  reluctance  to  focus  on  cause,  blame,  and  resultant  implications  are
troubling.

3) The reliance on the voluntary cooperation of key figures in the investigation

neer on the payroll to facilitate his involvement in the investigation, utilizing

vestigation  when  I  see  one.  I  feel  the  inherent  character  of  NIST  as  a  re-
search rather than investigative agency was a factor in this situation.

person  accounts  of  stairwell  evacuation,  and  length  of  time  it  took  to  evac-
uate the building was a shortcoming.

5) The relative secrecy of the investigation, and the withholding of all materials
and documents used by NIST to arrive at the study’s conclusions is very dis-
turbing.  These  materials  should  be  made  available  to  professionals  for  fur-
ther study and analysis, to question and/or duplicate the findings, according
to  the  scientific  method,  and  should  not  be  locked  away  in  the  National  Ar-
chives  or  anywhere  else.  I  hope  I  can  call  on  the  Science  Committee  to
unlock this information for the American public.

In  conclusion,  for  these  and  other  reasons,  I  feel  that  government  must  take  a

of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign. Thank you for this opportunity to speak today.
God bless you all.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, and you continue to

be an inspiration to this committee.

Let me point out that now, the witnesses that will follow. I hope
you are going to be able to remain to listen to their testimony, and
to  listen  to  the  questioning.  I  think  you  are  absolutely  correct  in
pointing out that I think it is a shared interest in being more spe-
cific, rather than vague, in the report, but NIST, I think, has done
an  outstanding  job,  and  NIST  correctly,  as  you  identified  in  your
testimony,  is  not  an  investigative  agency.  It  is  a  research  agency.
I have found NIST to be most cooperative, but we are going to hold
their feet to the fire, and we are going to make certain they follow
through in their recommendations.

So, I think, hopefully, some measure of comfort will come to you
from  the  statement  of  Dr.  Jeffrey  and  his  expressed  determination
to  follow  through  on  this.  And  I  think  you  will  be  interested  in
what  some  of  other  witnesses  have  to  say.  These  are  people  with
whom  you  are  familiar.  And  finally,  I  just  hope  it  is  not  the  do-
gooders  versus  the  business  interests.  I  think  we  have  got  to  have
a partnership here. It is good business to make buildings safer, and
that does good in the process. So, we will all work together. Thank
you very much.

Ms. REGENHARD. Thank you very much.
Chairman BOEHLERT. The second panel today consists of Dr. Wil-
liam  Jeffrey,  Director  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and
Technology;  Ms.  Nancy  McNabb,  Director  of  Government  Affairs,
National  Fire  Protection  Association;  Dr.  James  R.  Harris,  Presi-
dent, J.R. Harris and Company, Member, American Society of Civil
Engineers;  and  Mr.  Glenn  Corbett,  Assistant  Professor  of  Fire
Science, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Member of NIST Na-
tional  Construction  Safety  Team  Advisory  Board;  and  for  the  pur-
pose  of  an  introduction  of  our  final  witness,  I  call  on  our  distin-
guished colleague, Mr. Schwarz of Michigan.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  not  frequently
that  I  have  the  opportunity  to  introduce  a  constituent  to  his  testi-
fying  before  this  committee,  but  in  this  case,  Mr.  Henry  L.  Green
not only serves as President of the Board of Directors for the Inter-
national  Code  Council,  but  as  an  expert  in  his  field,  and  as  a  con-
stituent of mine from Delta Township, which is just outside of Lan-
sing, Michigan. In 1989, Mr. Green was appointed Executive Direc-
tor  of  the  Bureau  of  Construction  Codes  and  Fire  Safety  for  the
Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth. Henry, they
keep  changing  the  names  of  the  departments.  That  was  what  it
was when I was in the State senate. He has worked in the Bureau
for more than 20 years, serving as Building Inspector, Chief of the
Barrier  Free  Design  Division,  Chief  Building  Inspector,  and  as
Deputy  Director  before  assuming  his  current  role.  He  also  serves
on the Building Officials Code Administration, BOCA, Board of Di-
rectors, serving as President in 1997.

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Green is eminently qualified to testify before
this  committee,  and  I  am  equally  delighted  that  he  is  here  and  a
constituent of mine from mid-Michigan, from the 7th District. Actu-
ally,  he  is  from  Spartan  Country,  not  Wolverine  Country,  but  we
will forgive him for that.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Mr.  Green  would  join  us  at  the  table,  and
thank you very much for that eloquent introduction. I have had the
pleasure  of  meeting  Mr.  Green,  and  I  want  to  welcome  you  here.
I  want  to  welcome  all  of  you  here,  and  I  want  to  thank  you  for
being  resources  for  this  committee.  I  particularly  want  to  welcome
Dr.  Jeffrey  in  his  maiden  public  appearance  before  the  Science
Committee, in his present capacity.

Dr.  Jeffrey,  the  floor  is  yours.  And  I  would  say  to  all  our  wit-
nesses,  we  would  ask  that  you  try  to  summarize  your  opening
statement in five minutes or so. We are not going to be all that ar-
bitrary, but that will allow more time for questions and interaction
between the panel and the Members. Dr. Jeffrey, the floor is yours.

Panel II:

STATEMENT OF DR. WILLIAM JEFFREY, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL

INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY

Dr.  JEFFREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  also  thank  you  for

your warm welcome remarks.

aster.  With  your  permission,  I  have  a  written  statement  for  the
record, along with our final report.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Without  objection,  so  ordered.  All  the

statements in their entirety will be part of the official record.

Dr. JEFFREY. And I will now summarize our work to date and our
plans  for  the  future.  We  announced  this  investigation  saying  it
would  be  thorough,  open,  and  result  in  meaningful  recommenda-
tions.

It was thorough. NIST was able to acquire and test enough steel
from the buildings to have confidence in our findings. We acquired
more  than  7,000  photos  and  150  hours  of  videotape.  We  inter-
viewed  nearly  1,200  survivors  and  first  responders,  and  we  gained
access to key information about the building’s design and construc-
tion.

It  was  also  open.  We  sought  public  comment  on  our  plans  even
before  we  began  the  investigation.  We  held  numerous  briefings  for
the  public,  published  reports  on  our  progress,  and  solicited  com-
ments. We sought input from an advisory committee of outside ex-
perts. We established a special liaison with the families of victims,
and  communicated  regularly  with  the  relevant  organizations  in
New  York  City.  This  was  no  academic  exercise.  We  were  charged
with  developing  meaningful  recommendations,  and  we  have  done
that.  Using  the  recommendations  from  this  investigation  to  make
improvements  in  the  way  people  design,  maintain,  and  use  build-
ings  has  just  begun.  NIST  is  working  vigorously  with  the  relevant
communities to turn the recommendations into action.

The  direct  link  between  the  terrorist-initiated  airplane  attacks,
the  ensuing  fires,  and  the  collapse  of  the  towers  was  established
through  extensive  testing,  analyses,  and  computer  modeling.  Here,
you  see  a  model  of  the  aircraft  as  it  enters  Tower  1,  and  the  dam-
age  that  was  inflicted  as  debris  and  jet  fuel  spread  over  multiple
floors.  These  models  helped  us  to  estimate  the  internal  damage  to
the  structure  and  fireproofing  that  was  not  visible  in  photos  and
videos taken from the outside.

The  egress  capacity  required  by  the  current  building  codes  is
based  on  evacuating  a  single  floor,  not  an  entire  building.  Fortu-
nately,  the  towers  were  only  one  third  to  one  half  of  full  capacity
that  morning,  allowing  87  percent  of  the  occupants  to  evacuate.
Had  the  buildings  been  full,  with  about  20,000  occupants  each,
roughly 14,000 people may have lost their lives. Radio communica-
tions  were  a  problem  due  to  three  factors:  first,  the  challenging
radio  frequency  environment  posed  by  buildings;  second,  the  scale
of  operations  that  overwhelmed  the  available  frequencies  and  ex-
ceeded the limits of the communication protocols; and third, the dif-
ficulty of transmissions between different organizations.

The recommendations we have made call for specific actions. We
made our recommendations as specific as we could, identifying the
parties that need to help take the next steps. The recommendations
do  not  prescribe  specific  systems,  materials,  or  technologies.  In-
stead,  NIST  encourages  competition  among  alternatives  that  can
meet  performance  requirements.  Within  these  recommendations,
NIST  has  identified  37  specific  national  model  codes,  standards,
practice guidelines, or regulations that merit consideration through
an open and consensus-driven process.

NIST’s  response  plan  consists  of  three  parts.  First,  the  building
and fire safety investigation. And today, we are releasing the final
version  of  43  reports  documenting  this  investigation,  and  plan  to
release draft reports in the spring documenting our investigation of
WTC 7. Second, our research and development program, and third,
a  dissemination  and  technical  assistance  program  to  facilitate
adoption of the proposed changes.

As  part  of  this  effort,  NIST  is  aggressively  working  with  the
model  building  code  organizations  and  others  representing  State
and  local  officials  to  facilitate  this  process.  Among  other  things,
NIST has held a major conference to focus attention on getting ac-
tion  on  these  recommendations.  We  have  contracted  with  the  Na-
tional  Institute  of  Building  Sciences  to  turn  the  appropriate  rec-
ommendations  into  draft  code  language  for  submission  to  the  na-
tional model code developers, and we have assigned a staff member
responsibility  for  following  up  on  each  and  every  recommendation.
Past  NIST  investigations  have  resulted  in  substantive  improve-
ments  in  building  safety.  For  example,  improvements  to  manufac-
tured homes were made following our work on Hurricanes Andrew
and  Camille.  Improvements  in  construction  safety  and  inspection
resulted from NIST’s investigation of an apartment building under
construction  in  Connecticut.  There  are  many  more  examples  of
NIST’s investigations resulting in improvements to building safety,
and  we  will  do  everything  possible  to  add  the  WTC  investigation
to this list.

Thank  you  for  your  support  and  this  opportunity  to  update  the

Committee.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM JEFFREY

Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee, I am William Jeffrey, Director of
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology.  I  am  pleased  to  appear  today
and  testify  on  the  building  and  fire  safety  investigation  of  the  World  Trade  Center
disaster  carried  out  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST).
NIST announced its building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade Cen-
ter  (WTC)  disaster  on  August  21,  2002.1 This  WTC  Investigation  was  then  con-
ducted  under  the  authority  of  the  National  Construction  Safety  Team  (NCST)  Act,
which was signed into law on October 1, 2002.

The goals of the investigation of the WTC disaster were:

• To investigate the building construction, the materials used, and the technical
conditions  that  contributed  to  the  outcome  of  the  WTC  disaster  after  terror-
ists flew large jet-fuel laden commercial airliners into the WTC towers.

• To serve as the basis for:

— Improvements  in  the  way  buildings  are  designed,  constructed,  main-

tained, and used;

— Improved tools and guidance for industry and safety officials;
— Recommended  revisions  to  current  codes,  standards,  and  practices;  and
— Improved public safety.

1 NIST is a nonregulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The purposes of NIST
investigations  are  to  improve  the  safety  and  structural  integrity  of  buildings  in  the  United
States and the focus is on fact finding. NIST investigative teams are required to assess building
performance  and  emergency  response  and  evacuation  procedures  in  the  wake  of  any  building
failure that has resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed significant potential of substan-
tial  loss  of  life.  NIST  does  not  have  the  statutory  authority  to  make  findings  of  fault  or  neg-
ligence  by  individuals  or  organizations.  Further,  no  part  of  any  report  resulting  from  a  NIST
investigation  into  a  building  failure  or  from  an  investigation  under  the  National  Construction
Safety Team Act may be used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter men-
tioned in such report (15 USC 281a, as amended by P.L. 107–231).

The specific objectives were:

1. Determine  why  and  how  WTC  1  and  WTC  2  collapsed  following  the  initial

impacts of the aircraft and why and how WTC 7 collapsed;

2. Determine  why  the  injuries  and  fatalities  were  so  high  or  low  depending  on
location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, occupant behavior,
evacuation, and emergency response;

3. Determine what procedures and practices were used in the design, construc-

tion, operation, and maintenance of WTC 1, 2, and 7.

4. Identify,  as  specifically  as  possible,  areas  in  current  building  and  fire  codes,

standards, and practices that warrant revision.

APPROACH

To  meet  these  goals,  NIST  complemented  its  in-house  expertise  with  an  array  of
specialists in key technical areas. In all, over 200 staff contributed to the investiga-
tion.  NIST  and  its  contractors  compiled  and  reviewed  tens  of  thousand  of  pages  of
documents; conducted interviews with over a thousand people who had been on the
scene  or  who  had  been  involved  with  the  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  of
the  WTC;  analyzed  236  pieces  of  steel  that  were  obtained  from  the  wreckage;  per-
formed laboratory tests that measured material properties, and performed computer
simulations of the sequence of events that happened from the instant of aircraft im-
pact to the initiation of collapse for each tower.

Cooperation  in  obtaining  the  resource  materials  and  in  interpreting  the  results
came from a large number of individuals and organizations, including The Port Au-
thority of New York and New Jersey and its contractors and consultants, Silverstein
Properties and its contractors and consultants, the City of New York and its depart-
ments,  the  manufacturers  and  fabricators  of  the  building  components,  the  compa-
nies that insured the WTC towers, the building tenants, the aircraft manufacturers,
the airlines, and the media.

The scarcity of physical evidence that is typically available in place for reconstruc-

tion of a disaster led to the following approach:

• Accumulation of copious photographic and video material. With the assistance
of  the  media,  public  agencies  and  individual  photographers,  NIST  acquired
and  organized  nearly  7,000  segments  of  video  footage,  totaling  in  excess  of
150  hours  and  nearly  7,000  photographs  representing  at  least  185  photog-
raphers. This guided the Investigation Team’s efforts to determine the condi-
tion  of  the  buildings  following  the  aircraft  impact,  the  evolution  of  the  fires,
and the subsequent deterioration of the structure.
• Establishment of the baseline performance of the WTC towers, i.e., estimating
the expected performance of the towers under normal design loads and condi-
tions.  The  baseline  performance  analysis  also  helped  to  estimate  the  ability
of the towers to withstand the unexpected events of September 11, 2001. Es-
tablishing the baseline performance of the towers began with the compilation
and analysis of the procedures and practices used in the design, construction,
operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  structural,  fire  protection,  and  egress  sys-
tems of the WTC towers. The additional components of the performance anal-
ysis  were  the  standard  fire  resistance  of  the  WTC  truss-framed  floor  system,
the quality and properties of the structural steels used in the towers, and the
response of the WTC towers to the design gravity and wind loads.
• Conduct simulations of the behavior of each tower on September 11, 2001, in

four steps:

1. The aircraft impact into the tower, the resulting distribution of aviation
fuel, and the damage to the structure, partitions, thermal insulation ma-
terials, and building contents.

2. The evolution of multi-floor fires.
3. The heating and consequent weakening of the structural elements by the

fires.

4. The response of the damaged and heated building structure, and the pro-
gression  of  structural  component  failures  leading  to  the  initiation  of  the
collapse of the towers.

For  such  complex  structures  and  complex  thermal  and  structural  processes,  each
of these steps stretched the state of the technology and tested the limits of software
tools and computer hardware. For example, the investigators advanced the state-of-
the-art in the measurement of construction material properties and in structural fi-

nite  element  modeling.  New  modeling  capability  was  developed  for  the  mapping  of
fire-generated environmental temperatures onto the building structural components.
The  output  of  the  four-step  simulations  was  subject  to  uncertainties  in  the  as-
built  condition  of  the  towers,  the  interior  layout  and  furnishings,  the  aircraft  im-
pact,  the  internal  damage  to  the  towers  (especially  the  thermal  insulation  for  fire
protection  of  the  structural  steel,  which  is  colloquially  referred  to  as  fireproofing),
the  redistribution  of  the  combustibles,  and  the  response  of  the  building  structural
components  to  the  heat  from  the  fires.  To  increase  confidence  in  the  simulation  re-
sults,  NIST  used  the  visual  evidence,  eyewitness  accounts  from  inside  and  outside
the  buildings,  laboratory  tests  involving  large  fires  and  the  heating  of  structural
components,  and  formal  statistical  methods  to  identify  influential  parameters  and
quantify the variability in analysis results.

• Combination  of  the  knowledge  gained  into  probable  collapse  sequences  for
each tower,2 the identification of factors that contributed to the collapse, and
a  list  of  factors  that  could  have  improved  building  performance  or  otherwise
mitigated the loss of life.
• Compilation of a list of findings that respond to the first three objectives and

a list of recommendations that responds to the fourth objective.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Objective 1: Determine why and how WTC 1 and WTC 2 collapsed following
the initial impacts of the aircraft.

• The  two  aircraft  hit  the  towers  at  high  speed  and  did  considerable  damage
to  principal  structural  components  (core  columns,  floors,  and  perimeter  col-
umns)  that  were  directly  impacted  by  the  aircraft  or  associated  debris.  How-
ever,  the  towers  withstood  the  impacts  and  would  have  remained  standing
were  it  not  for  the  dislodged  insulation  (fireproofing)  and  the  subsequent
multi-floor  fires.  The  robustness  of  the  perimeter  frame-tube  system  and  the
large size of the buildings helped the towers withstand the impact. The struc-
tural system redistributed loads from places of aircraft impact, avoiding larg-
er scale damage upon impact. The hat truss, a feature atop each tower which
was  intended  to  support  a  television  antenna,  prevented  earlier  collapse  of
the  building  core.  In  each  tower,  a  different  combination  of  impact  damage
and  heat-weakened  structural  components  contributed  to  the  abrupt  struc-
tural collapse.
• In WTC 1, the fires weakened the core columns and caused the floors on the
south side of the building to sag. The floors pulled the heated south perimeter
columns  inward,  reducing  their  capacity  to  support  the  building  above.  Their
neighboring columns quickly became overloaded as columns on the south wall
buckled.  The  top  section  of  the  building  tilted  to  the  south  and  began  its  de-
scent.  The  time  from  aircraft  impact  to  collapse  initiation  was  largely  deter-
mined  by  how  long  it  took  for  the  fires  to  weaken  the  building  core  and  to
reach  the  south  side  of  the  building  and  weaken  the  perimeter  columns  and
floors.
• In  WTC  2,  the  core  was  damaged  severely  at  the  southeast  corner  and  was
restrained  by  the  east  and  south  walls  via  the  hat  truss  and  the  floors.  The
steady burning fires on the east side of the building caused the floors on that
side  to  sag.  The  floors  pulled  the  heated  east  perimeter  columns  inward,  re-
ducing  their  capacity  to  support  the  building  above.  Their  neighboring  col-
umns  quickly  became  overloaded  as  columns  on  the  east  wall  buckled.  The
top  section  of  the  building  tilted  to  the  east  and  to  the  south  and  began  its
descent. The time from aircraft impact to collapse initiation was largely deter-
mined by the time needed for the fires to weaken the perimeter columns and
floor  assemblies  on  the  east  and  the  south  sides  of  the  building.  WTC  2  col-
lapsed more quickly than WTC 1 because there was more aircraft damage to
the  building  core,  including  one  of  the  heavily  loaded  corner  columns,  and
there  were  early  and  persistent  fires  on  the  east  side  of  the  building,  where
the aircraft had extensively dislodged insulation from the structural steel.
• The  WTC  towers  likely  would  not  have  collapsed  under  the  combined  effects
of  aircraft  impact  damage  and  the  extensive,  multi-floor  fires  that  were  en-

2 The focus of the Investigation was on the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft im-
pact  to  the  initiation  of  collapse  for  each  tower.  For  brevity,  this  sequence  is  referred  to  as  the
‘‘probable collapse sequence,’’ although it includes little analysis of the structural behavior of the
tower  after  the  conditions  for  collapse  initiation  were  reached  and  collapse  became  inevitable.

countered on September 11, 2001 if the thermal insulation had not been wide-
ly dislodged or had been only minimally dislodged by aircraft impact.

• NIST  found  no  corroborating  evidence  for  alternative  hypotheses  suggesting
that the WTC towers were brought down by controlled demolition using explo-
sives  planted  prior  to  September  11,  2001.  NIST  also  did  not  find  any  evi-
dence that missiles were fired at or hit the towers. Instead, photographs and
videos  from  several  angles  clearly  showed  that  the  collapse  initiated  at  the
fire  and  impact  floors  and  that  the  collapse  progressed  from  the  initiating
floors downward, until the dust clouds obscured the view.

Objective  2:  Determine  why  the  injuries  and  fatalities  were  so  high  or  low
depending on location, including all technical aspects of fire protection, oc-
cupant behavior, evacuation, and emergency response.

• Approximately  87  percent  of  the  estimated  17,400  occupants  of  the  towers,
and  99  percent  of  those  located  below  the  impact  floors,  evacuated  success-
fully.  In  WTC  1,  where  the  aircraft  destroyed  all  escape  routes,  1,355  people
were  trapped  in  the  upper  floors  when  the  building  collapsed.  One  hundred
seven people who were below the impact floors did not survive. Since the flow
of  people  from  the  building  had  slowed  considerably  20  minutes  before  the
tower  collapsed,  the  stairwell  capacity  was  adequate  to  evacuate  the  occu-
pants on that morning.

• In  WTC  2,  before  the  second  aircraft  strike,  about  3,000  people  got  low
enough in the building to escape by a combination of self-evacuation and use
of elevators. The aircraft destroyed the operation of the elevators and the use
of  two  of  the  three  stairways.  Eighteen  people  from  above  the  impact  zone
found  a  passage  through  the  damaged  third  stairway  (Stairwell  A)  and  es-
caped. The other 619 people in or above the impact zone perished. Eleven peo-
ple  who  were  below  the  impact  floors  did  not  survive.  As  in  WTC  1,  shortly
before collapse, the flow of people from the building had slowed considerably,
indicating that the stairwell capacity was adequate that morning.

• About six percent of the survivors described themselves as mobility impaired,
with  recent  injury  and  chronic  illness  being  the  most  common  causes;  few,
however,  required  a  wheelchair.  Among  the  118  decedents  below  the  aircraft
impact  floors,  investigators  identified  seven  who  were  mobility  impaired,  but
were unable to determine the mobility capability of the remaining 111.

• A  principal  factor  limiting  the  loss  of  life  was  that  the  buildings  were  only
one-third to one-half occupied at the time of the attacks. NIST estimated that
if  the  towers  had  been  fully  occupied  with  20,000  occupants  each,  it  would
have taken just over 3 hours to evacuate the buildings and about 14,000 peo-
ple  might  have  perished  because  the  stairwell  capacity  would  not  have  been
sufficient to evacuate that many people in the available time. Egress capacity
required  by  current  building  codes  is  determined  by  single  floor  calculations
that  are  independent  of  building  height  and  does  not  consider  the  time  for
full building evacuation.

• Due to the presence of assembly use spaces at the top of each tower (Windows
on the World restaurant complex in WTC 1 and the Top of the Deck observa-
tion deck in WTC 2) that were designed to accommodate over 1,000 occupants
per floor, the New York City Building Code would have required a minimum
of  four  independent  means  of  egress  (stairs),  one  more  than  the  three  that
were  available  in  the  buildings.  Given  the  low  occupancy  level  on  September
11,  2001,  NIST  found  that  the  issue  of  egress  capacity  from  these  places  of
assembly,  or  from  elsewhere  in  the  buildings,  was  not  a  significant  factor  on
that day. It is conceivable that such a fourth stairwell, depending on its loca-
tion  and  the  effects  of  aircraft  impact  on  its  functional  integrity,  could  have
remained passable, allowing evacuation by an unknown number of additional
occupants  from  above  the  floors  of  impact.  If  the  buildings  had  been  filled  to
their  capacity  with  20,000  occupants,  however,  the  required  fourth  stairway
would  likely  have  mitigated  the  insufficient  egress  capacity  for  conducting  a
full building evacuation within the available time.

• Evacuation  was  assisted  by  participation  in  fire  drills  within  the  previous
year  by  two-thirds  of  survivors  and  perhaps  hindered  by  a  Local  Law  that
prevented  employers  from  requiring  occupants  to  practice  using  the  stair-
ways. The stairways were not easily navigated in some locations due to their
design,  which  included  ‘‘transfer  hallways,’’  where  evacuees  had  to  traverse
from  one  stairway  to  another  location  where  the  stairs  continued.  Addition-

ally, many occupants were unprepared for the physical challenge of full build-
ing evacuation.
• The functional integrity and survivability of the stairwells was affected by the
separation  of  the  stairwells  and  the  structural  integrity  of  stairwell  enclo-
sures. In the impact region of WTC 1, the stairwell separation was the small-
est over the building height—clustered well within the building core—and all
stairwells  were  destroyed  by  the  aircraft  impact.  By  contrast,  the  separation
of stairwells in the impact region of WTC 2 was the largest over the building
height—located  along  different  boundaries  of  the  building  core—and  one  of
three  stairwells  remained  marginally  passable  after  the  aircraft  impact.  The
shaft  enclosures  were  fire  rated  but  were  not  required  to  have  structural  in-
tegrity  under  typical  accidental  loads:  there  were  numerous  reports  of  stair-
wells obstructed by fallen debris from damaged enclosures.
• The  active  fire  safety  systems  (sprinklers,  smoke  purge,  fire  alarms,  and
emergency  occupant  communications)  were  designed  to  meet  or  exceed  cur-
rent practice. However, with the exception of the evacuation announcements,
they  played  no  role  in  the  safety  of  life  on  September  11  because  the  water
supplies  to  the  sprinklers  were  damaged  by  the  aircraft  impact.  The  smoke
purge systems, operated under the direction of the fire department after fires,
were not turned on, but they also would have been ineffective due to aircraft
damage. The violence of the aircraft impact served as its own alarm. In WTC
2, contradictory public address announcements contributed to occupant confu-
sion and some delay in occupants beginning to evacuate.
• For the approximately 1,000 emergency responders on the scene, this was the
largest disaster they had even seen. Despite attempts by the responding agen-
cies to work together and perform their own tasks, the extent of the incident
was  well  beyond  their  capabilities.  Communications  were  erratic  due  to  the
high  number  of  calls  and  the  inadequate  performance  of  some  of  the  gear.
Even  so,  there  was  no  way  to  digest,  test  for  accuracy,  and  disseminate  the
vast amount of information being received. Their jobs were complicated by the
loss  of  command  centers  in  WTC  7  and  then  in  the  towers  after  WTC  2  col-
lapsed.  With  nearly  all  elevator  service  disrupted  and  progress  up  the  stairs
taking about two min. per floor, it would have taken hours for the responders
to  reach  their  destinations,  assist  survivors,  and  escape  had  the  towers  not
collapsed.

Objective 3: Determine what procedures and practices were used in the de-
sign, construction, operation, and maintenance of WTC 1 and WTC 2.

• Because  of  The  Port  Authority’s  establishment  under  a  clause  of  the  United
States Constitution, its buildings were not subject to any state or local build-
ing  regulations.  The  buildings  were  unlike  any  others  previously  built,  both
in  their  height  and  in  their  innovative  structural  features.  Nevertheless,  the
actual  design  and  approval  process  produced  two  buildings  that  generally
were consistent with nearly all of the provisions of the New York City Build-
ing  Code  and  other  building  codes  of  that  time  that  were  reviewed  by  NIST.
The loads for which the buildings were designed exceeded the New York City
code  requirements.  The  quality  of  the  structural  steels  was  consistent  with
the building specifications. The departures from the building codes and stand-
ards  identified  by  NIST  did  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  outcome  of
September 11.
• For  the  floor  systems,  the  fire  rating  and  insulation  thickness  used  on  the
floor trusses, which together with the concrete slab served as the main source
of support for the floors, were of concern from the time of initial construction.
NIST  found  no  technical  basis  or  test  data  on  which  the  thermal  protection
of the steel was based. On September 11, 2001, the minimum specified thick-
ness  of  the  insulation  was  adequate  to  delay  heating  of  the  trusses;  the
amount of insulation dislodged by the aircraft impact, however, was sufficient
to cause the structural steel to be heated to critical levels.
• Based  on  four  standard  fire  resistance  tests  that  were  conducted  under  a
range of insulation and test conditions, NIST found the fire rating of the floor
system  to  vary  between  d  hour  and  two  hours;  in  all  cases,  the  floors  contin-
ued to support the full design load without collapse for over two hours.
• The  wind  loads  used  for  the  WTC  towers,  which  governed  the  structural  de-
sign  of  the  external  columns  and  provided  the  baseline  capacity  of  the  struc-
tures  to  withstand  abnormal  events  such  as  major  fires  or  impact  damage,
significantly  exceeded  the  requirements  of  the  New  York  City  Building  Code

While  there  were  unique  aspects  to  the  design  of  the  WTC  towers  and  the  ter-
rorist attacks of September 11, 2001, NIST has compiled a list of recommendations
to  improve  the  safety  of  tall  buildings,  occupants,  and  emergency  responders  based
on its investigation of the procedures and practices that were used for the WTC tow-
ers;  these  procedures  and  practices  are  commonly  used  in  the  design,  construction,
operation,  and  maintenance  of  buildings  under  normal  conditions.  Public  officials
and  building  owners  will  need  to  determine  appropriate  performance  requirements
for  those  tall  buildings,  and  selected  other  buildings,  that  are  at  higher  risk  due  to
their iconic status, critical function, or design.

The  topics  of  the  recommendations  in  eight  groups  are  listed  in  Table  1.  A  com-
plete  listing  of  the  30  recommendations  is  provided  in  Appendix  A.  The  ordering
does not reflect any priority.

The eight major groups of recommendations are:

and  other  building  codes  of  the  day  that  were  reviewed  by  NIST.  Two  sets
of  wind  load  estimates  for  the  towers  obtained  by  independent  commercial
consultants  in  2002,  however,  differed  by  as  much  as  40  percent.  These  esti-
mates were based on wind tunnel tests conducted as part of insurance litiga-
tion unrelated to the Investigation.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The  tragic  consequences  of  the  September  11,  2001,  attacks  were  directly  attrib-
utable  to  the  fact  that  terrorists  flew  large  jet-fuel  laden  commercial  airliners  into
the  WTC  towers.  Buildings  for  use  by  the  general  population  are  not  designed  to
withstand  attacks  of  such  severity;  building  regulations  do  not  require  building  de-
signs  to  consider  aircraft  impact.  In  our  cities,  there  has  been  no  experience  with
a  disaster  of  such  magnitude,  nor  has  there  been  any  in  which  the  total  collapse
of a high-rise building occurred so rapidly and with little warning.

• Increased  Structural  Integrity:  The  standards  for  estimating  the  load  effects
of potential hazards (e.g., progressive collapse, wind) and the design of struc-
tural  systems  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  those  hazards  should  be  improved  to
enhance structural integrity.
• Enhanced  Fire  Endurance  of  Structures:  The  procedures  and  practices  used
to  ensure  the  fire  endurance  of  structures  should  be  enhanced  by  improving
the  technical  basis  for  construction  classifications  and  fire  resistance  ratings,
improving  the  technical  basis  for  standard  fire  resistance  testing  methods,
use  of  the  ‘‘structural  frame’’  approach  to  fire  resistance  ratings,  and  devel-
oping  in-service  performance  requirements  and  conformance  criteria  for
sprayed fire-resistive material.
• New  Methods  for  Fire  Resistant  Design  of  Structures:  The  procedures  and
practices  used  in  the  fire  resistant  design  of  structures  should  be  enhanced
by  requiring  an  objective  that  uncontrolled  fires  result  in  burnout  without
local or global collapse. Performance-based methods are an alternative to pre-
scriptive  design  methods.  This  effort  should  include  the  development  and
evaluation  of  new  fire  resistive  coating  materials  and  technologies  and  eval-
uation  of  the  fire  performance  of  conventional  and  high-performance  struc-
tural materials.
• Improved  Active  Fire  Protection:  Active  fire  protection  systems  (i.e.,  sprin-
klers, standpipes/hoses, fire alarms, and smoke management systems) should
be  enhanced  through  improvements  to  design,  performance,  reliability,  and
redundancy of such systems.
• Improved Building Evacuation: Building evacuation should be improved to in-
clude system designs that facilitate safe and rapid egress, methods for ensur-
ing clear and timely emergency communications to occupants, better occupant
preparedness  for  evacuation  during  emergencies,  and  incorporation  of  appro-
priate egress technologies.
• Improved  Emergency  Response:  Technologies  and  procedures  for  emergency
response should be improved to enable better access to buildings, response op-
erations, emergency communications, and command and control in large-scale
emergencies.
• Improved Procedures and Practices: The procedures and practices used in the
design,  construction,  maintenance,  and  operation  of  buildings  should  be  im-
proved  to  include  encouraging  code  compliance  by  non-governmental  and
quasi-governmental entities, adoption and application of egress and sprinkler
requirements in codes for existing buildings, and retention and availability of
building documents over the life of a building.

• Education  and  Training:  The  professional  skills  of  building  and  fire  safety
professionals should be upgraded though a national education and training ef-
fort  for  fire  protection  engineers,  structural  engineers,  architects,  regulatory
personnel, and emergency responders.

The  recommendations  call  for  action  by  specific  entities  regarding  standards,
codes  and  regulations,  their  adoption  and  enforcement,  professional  practices,  edu-
cation, and training; and research and development. Only when each of the entities
carries out its role will the implementation of a recommendation be effective.

The recommendations do not prescribe specific systems, materials, or technologies.
Instead,  NIST  encourages  competition  among  alternatives  that  can  meet  perform-
ance  requirements.  The  recommendations  also  do  not  prescribe  specific  threshold
levels; NIST believes that this responsibility properly falls within the purview of the
public policy setting process, in which the standards and codes development process
plays a key role.

NIST  believes  the  recommendations  are  realistic  and  achievable  within  a  reason-
able  period  of  time.  Only  a  few  of  the  recommendations  call  for  new  requirements
in standards and codes. Most of the recommendations deal with improving an exist-
ing  standard  or  code  requirement,  establishing  a  standard  for  an  existing  practice
without  one,  establishing  the  technical  basis  for  an  existing  requirement,  making  a
current requirement risk-consistent, adopting or enforcing a current requirement, or
establishing  a  performance-based  alternative  to  a  current  prescriptive  requirement.
NEXT STEPS

We  have  strongly  urged  that  immediate  and  serious  consideration  be  given  to
these  recommendations  by  the  building  and  fire  safety  communities  in  order  to
achieve  appropriate  improvements  in  the  way  buildings  are  designed,  constructed,
maintained,  and  used  and  in  evacuation  and  emergency  response  procedures-with
the  goal  of  making  buildings,  occupants,  and  first  responders  safer  in  future  emer-
gencies.

We  are  also  strongly  urging  building  owners  and  public  officials  to  (1)  evaluate
the  safety  implications  of  these  recommendations  to  their  existing  inventory  of
buildings and (2) take the steps necessary to mitigate any unwarranted risks with-
out waiting for changes to occur in codes, standards, and practices.

We  are  urging  state  and  local  agencies  to  rigorously  enforce  building  codes  and
standards  since  such  enforcement  is  critical  to  ensure  the  expected  level  of  safety.
Unless  they  are  complied  with,  the  best  codes  and  standards  cannot  protect  occu-
pants, emergency responders, or buildings.

I  have  assigned  top  priority  for  NIST  staff  to  work  vigorously  with  the  building
and fire safety communities to assure that there is a complete understanding of the
recommendations  and  to  provide  needed  technical  assistance  in  getting  the  rec-
ommendations implemented. We have identified specific codes, standards, and prac-
tices  affected  by  each  of  the  recommendations  in  its  summary  report  for  the  WTC
towers  and  already  begun  to  reach  out  to  the  responsible  organizations  to  pave  the
way for a timely, expedited consideration of the recommendations. Toward this end,
we held a conference September 13–15, 2005 that was attended by over 200 people,
including all of the major standards and codes development organizations.

We  have  also  awarded  a  contract  to  the  National  Institute  of  Building  Sciences
(NIBS)  to  turn  many  of  the  recommendations  into  code  language  suitable  for  sub-
mission of code change proposals to the two national model code developers.

In  addition,  we  will  implement  a  web-based  system  so  that  the  public  can  track
progress  on  implementing  the  recommendations.  The  web  site  will  list  each  of  the
recommendations,  the  specific  organization  or  organizations  (e.g.,  standards  and
code  developers,  professional  groups,  state  and  local  authorities)  responsible  for  its
implementation,  the  status  of  its  implementation  by  organization,  and  the  plans  or
work in progress to implement the recommendations.

We  are  releasing  the  final  versions  of  the  43  reports  on  NIST’s  investigation  of
the WTC towers, totaling some 10,000 pages, today. Our current plans are to release
next spring an additional five reports as drafts for public comment on the investiga-
tion of WTC 7.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  thank  you  and  the  Committee  again  for  allowing  me  to
testify today about NIST’s building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade
Center disaster. I would be happy to answer any questions at this time.

Appendix A. List of Recommendations
Group 1. Increased Structural Integrity
The standards for estimating the load effects of potential hazards (e.g., pro-
gressive  collapse,  wind)  and  the  design  of  structural  systems  to  mitigate
the  effects  of  those  hazards  should  be  improved  to  enhance  structural  in-
tegrity.

Recommendation  1.  NIST  recommends  that:  (1)  progressive  collapse  be  pre-
vented  in  buildings  through  the  development  and  nationwide  adoption  of  con-
sensus standards and code provisions, along with the tools and guidelines need-
ed for their use in practice; and (2) a standard methodology be developed—sup-
ported by analytical design tools and practical design guidance—to reliably pre-
dict  the  potential  for  complex  failures  in  structural  systems  subjected  to  mul-
tiple hazards.
Recommendation  2.  NIST  recommends  that  nationally  accepted  performance
standards  be  developed  for:  (1)  conducting  wind  tunnel  testing  of  prototype
structures  based  on  sound  technical  methods  that  result  in  repeatable  and  re-
producible  results  among  testing  laboratories;  and  (2)  estimating  wind  loads
and  their  effects  on  tall  buildings  for  use  in  design,  based  on  wind  tunnel  test-
ing data and directional wind speed data.
Recommendation 3. NIST recommends that an appropriate criterion be devel-
oped and implemented to enhance the performance of tall buildings by limiting
how much they sway under lateral load design conditions (e.g., winds and earth-
quakes).

Group 2. Enhanced Fire Endurance of Structures

The procedures and practices used to ensure the fire endurance of struc-
tures be enhanced by improving the technical basis for construction classi-
fications  and  fire  resistance  ratings,  improving  the  technical  basis  for
standard  fire  resistance  testing  methods,  use  of  the  ‘‘structural  frame’’  ap-
proach to fire resistance ratings, and developing in-service performance re-
quirements and conformance criteria for sprayed fire-resistive materials.

Recommendation 4. NIST recommends evaluating, and where needed improv-
ing,  the  technical  basis  for  determining  appropriate  construction  classification
and fire rating requirements (especially for tall buildings)—and making related
code changes now as much as possible—by explicitly considering factors includ-
ing:

structural integrity;

or the time required for burnout without local collapse;

• timely  access  by  emergency  responders  and  full  evacuation  of  occupants,
• the  extent  to  which  redundancy  in  active  fire  protection  (sprinkler  and
standpipe,  fire  alarm,  and  smoke  management)  systems  should  be  cred-
ited for occupant life safety;
• the  need  for  redundancy  in  fire  protection  systems  that  are  critical  to
• the  ability  of  the  structure  and  local  floor  systems  to  withstand  a  max-
imum  credible  fire  scenario  without  collapse,  recognizing  that  sprinklers
could be compromised, not operational, or non-existent;
• compartmentation  requirements  (e.g.,  12,000  ft2 1)  to  protect  the  struc-
ture, including fire rated doors and automatic enclosures, and limiting air
supply (e.g., thermally resistant window assemblies) to retard fire spread
in buildings with large, open floor plans;
• the effect of spaces containing unusually large fuel concentrations for the
• the  extent  to  which  fire  control  systems,  including  suppression  by  auto-
matic  or  manual  means,  should  be  credited  as  part  of  the  prevention  of
fire spread.

expected occupancy of the building; and

Recommendation  5.  NIST  recommends  that  the  technical  basis  for  the  cen-
tury-old standard for fire resistance testing of components, assemblies, and sys-
tems  be  improved  through  a  national  effort.  Necessary  guidance  also  should  be
developed  for  extrapolating  the  results  of  tested  assemblies  to  prototypical

1 Or a more appropriate limit, which represents a reasonable area for active firefighting oper-

ations.

building  systems.  A  key  step  in  fulfilling  this  recommendation  is  to  establish
a  capability  for  studying  and  testing  the  components,  assemblies,  and  systems
under realistic fire and load conditions.
Recommendation 6. NIST recommends the development of criteria, test meth-
ods,  and  standards:  (1)  for  the  in-service  performance  of  sprayed  fire-resistive
materials  (SFRM,  also  commonly  referred  to  as  fireproofing  or  insulation)  used
to  protect  structural  components;  and  (2)  to  ensure  that  these  materials,  as-in-
stalled, conform to conditions in tests used to establish the fire resistance rating
of components, assemblies, and systems.
Recommendation  7.  NIST  recommends  the  adoption  and  use  of  the  ‘‘struc-
tural  frame’’  approach  to  fire  resistance  ratings.  This  approach  requires  that
structural  members—such  as  girders,  beams,  trusses  and  spandrels  having  di-
rect  connection  to  the  columns,  and  bracing  members  designed  to  carry  gravity
loads—be fire protected to the same fire resistance rating as columns.

Group 3. New Methods for Fire Resistant Design of Structures

The  procedures  and  practices  used  in  the  fire  resistant  design  of  struc-
tures should be enhanced by requiring an objective that uncontrolled fires
result  in  burnout  without  partial  or  global  (total)  collapse.  Performance-
based  methods  are  an  alternative  to  prescriptive  design  methods.  This  ef-
fort  should  include  the  development  and  evaluation  of  new  fire-resistive
coating  materials  and  technologies  and  evaluation  of  the  fire  performance
of conventional and high-performance structural materials.

Recommendation  8.  NIST  recommends  that  the  fire  resistance  of  structures
be  enhanced  by  requiring  a  performance  objective  that  uncontrolled  building
fires result in burnout without partial or global (total) collapse.
Recommendation  9.  NIST  recommends  the  development  of:  (1)  performance-
based  standards  and  code  provisions,  as  an  alternative  to  current  prescriptive
design  methods,  to  enable  the  design  and  retrofit  of  structures  to  resist  real
building fire conditions, including their ability to achieve the performance objec-
tive of burnout without structural or local floor collapse: and (2) the tools, guide-
lines, and test methods necessary to evaluate the fire performance of the struc-
ture as a whole system.
Recommendation  10.  NIST  recommends  the  development  and  evaluation  of
new  fire-resistive  coating  materials,  systems,  and  technologies  with  significantly
enhanced  performance  and  durability  to  provide  protection  following  major
events.
Recommendation 11. NIST recommends that the performance and suitability
of  advanced  structural  steel,  reinforced  and  pre-stressed  concrete,  and  other
high-performance  material  systems  be  evaluated  for  use  under  conditions  ex-
pected in building fires.

Group 4. Improved Active Fire Protection

Active  fire  protection  systems  (i.e.,  sprinklers,  standpipes/hoses,  fire
alarms,  and  smoke  management  systems)  should  be  enhanced  through  im-
provements  to  design,  performance,  reliability,  and  redundancy  of  such
systems.

Recommendation  12.  NIST  recommends  that  the  performance  and  possibly
the  redundancy  of  active  fire  protection  systems  (sprinklers,  standpipes/hoses,
fire  alarms,  and  smoke  management  systems)  in  buildings  be  enhanced  to  ac-
commodate the greater risks associated with increasing building height and pop-
ulation,  increased  use  of  open  spaces,  high-risk  building  activities,  fire  depart-
ment response limits, transient fuel loads, and higher threat profile.
Recommendation  13.  NIST  recommends  that  fire  alarm  and  communications
systems  in  buildings  be  developed  to  provide  continuous,  reliable,  and  accurate
information  on  the  status  of  life  safety  conditions  at  a  level  of  detail  sufficient
to  manage  the  evacuation  process  in  building  fire  emergencies;  all  communica-
tion  and  control  paths  in  buildings  need  to  be  designed  and  installed  to  have
the  same  resistance  to  failure  and  increased  survivability  above  that  specified
in present standards.
Recommendation 14. NIST recommends that control panels at fire/emergency
command  stations  in  buildings  be  adapted  to  accept  and  interpret  a  larger
quantity  of  more  reliable  information  from  the  active  fire  protection  systems

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

46

that  provide  tactical  decision  aids  to  fireground  commanders,  including  water
flow rates from pressure and flow measurement devices, and that standards for
their performance be developed.
Recommendation  15.  NIST  recommends  that  systems  be  developed  and  im-
plemented  for:  (1)  real-time  off-site  secure  transmission  of  valuable  information
from fire alarm and other monitored building systems for use by emergency re-
sponders,  at  any  location,  to  enhance  situational  awareness  and  response  deci-
sions  and  maintain  safe  and  efficient  operations;  and  (2)  preservation  of  that
information  either  off-site  or  in  a  black  box  that  will  survive  a  fire  or  other
building  failure  for  purposes  of  subsequent  investigations  and  analysis.  Stand-
ards  for  the  performance  of  such  systems  should  be  developed,  and  their  use
should be required.

Group 5. Improved Building Evacuation

Building  evacuation  should  be  improved  to  include  system  designs  that
facilitate  safe  and  rapid  egress,  methods  for  ensuring  clear  and  timely
emergency communications to occupants, better occupant preparedness re-
garding  their  roles  and  duties  for  evacuation  during  emergencies,  and  in-
corporation of appropriate egress technologies.

Recommendation 16. NIST recommends that public agencies, non-profit orga-
nizations  concerned  with  building  and  fire  safety,  and  building  owners  and
managers develop and carry out public education and training campaigns, joint-
ly  and  on  a  nationwide  scale,  to  improve  building  occupants’  preparedness  for
evacuation in case of building emergencies.
Recommendation 17. NIST recommends that tall buildings be designed to ac-
commodate  timely  full  building  evacuation  of  occupants  due  to  building-specific
or  large-scale  emergencies  such  as  widespread  power  outages,  major  earth-
quakes, tornadoes, hurricanes without sufficient advanced warning, fires, explo-
sions, and terrorist attack. Building size, population, function, and iconic status
should be taken into account in designing the egress system. Stairwell capacity
and stair discharge door width should be adequate to accommodate counterflow
due to emergency access by responders.
Recommendation  18.  NIST  recommends  that  egress  systems  be  designed:  (1)
to  maximize  remoteness  of  egress  components  (i.e.,  stairs,  elevators,  exits)  with-
out negatively impacting the average travel distance; (2) to maintain their func-
tional  integrity  and  survivability  under  foreseeable  building-specific  or  large-
scale  emergencies;  and  (3)  with  consistent  layouts,  standard  signage,  and  guid-
ance so that systems become intuitive and obvious to building occupants during
evacuations.
Recommendation 19. NIST recommends that building owners, managers, and
emergency  responders  develop  a  joint  plan  and  take  steps  to  ensure  that  accu-
rate emergency information is communicated in a timely manner to enhance the
situational  awareness  of  building  occupants  and  emergency  responders  affected
by  an  event.  This  should  be  accomplished  through  better  coordination  of  infor-
mation  among  different  emergency  responder  groups,  efficient  sharing  of  that
information  among  building  occupants  and  emergency  responders,  more  robust
design  of  emergency  public  address  systems,  improved  emergency  responder
communication  systems,  and  use  of  the  Emergency  Broadcast  System  (now
known  as  the  Integrated  Public  Alert  and  Warning  System)  and  Community
Emergency Alert Networks.
Recommendation  20.  NIST  recommends  that  the  full  range  of  current  and
next  generation  evacuation  technologies  should  be  evaluated  for  future  use,  in-
cluding  protected/hardened  elevators,  exterior  escape  devices,  and  stairwell  de-
scent  devices,  which  may  allow  all  occupants  an  equal  opportunity  for  evacu-
ation and facilitate emergency response access.

Group 6. Improved Emergency Response

Technologies  and  procedures  for  emergency  response  should  be  im-
proved  to  enable  better  access  to  buildings,  response  operations,  emer-
gency  communications,  and  command  and  control  in  large-scale  emer-
gencies.

Recommendation  21.  NIST  recommends  the  installation  of  fire-protected  and
structurally hardened elevators to improve emergency response activities in tall
buildings  by  providing  timely  emergency  access  to  responders  and  allowing

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

evacuation of mobility impaired building occupants. Such elevators should be in-
stalled  for  exclusive  use  by  emergency  responders  during  emergencies.  In  tall
buildings, consideration also should be given to installing such elevators for use
by all occupants. The use of elevators for these purposes will require additional
operating  procedures  and  protocols,  as  well  as  a  requirement  for  release  of  ele-
vator door restrictors by emergency response personnel.
Recommendation 22. NIST recommends the installation, inspection, and test-
ing  of  emergency  communications  systems,  radio  communications,  and  associ-
ated  operating  protocols  to  ensure  that  the  systems  and  protocols:  (1)  are  effec-
tive  for  large-scale  emergencies  in  buildings  with  challenging  radio  frequency
propagation  environments;  and  (2)  can  be  used  to  identify,  locate,  and  track
emergency  responders  within  indoor  building  environments  and  in  the  field.
The  Federal  Government  should  coordinate  its  efforts  that  address  this  need
within  the  framework  provided  by  the  SAFECOM  program  of  the  Department
of Homeland Security.
Recommendation  23.  NIST  recommends  the  establishment  and  implementa-
tion  of  detailed  procedures  and  methods  for  gathering,  processing,  and  deliv-
ering critical information through integration of relevant voice, video, graphical,
and  written  data  to  enhance  the  situational  awareness  of  all  emergency  re-
sponders. An information intelligence sector2 should be established to coordinate
the effort for each incident.
Recommendation  24.  NIST  recommends  the  establishment  and  implementa-
tion of codes and protocols for ensuring effective and uninterrupted operation of
the command and control system for large-scale building emergencies.

Group 7. Improved Procedures and Practices

The  procedures  and  practices  used  in  the  design,  construction,  mainte-
nance,  and  operation  of  buildings  should  be  improved  to  include  encour-
aging  code  compliance  by  nongovernmental  and  quasi-governmental  enti-
ties,  adoption  and  application  of  egress  and  sprinkler  requirements  in
codes for existing buildings, and retention and availability of building doc-
uments over the life of a building.

Recommendation  25.  Non-governmental  and  quasi-governmental  entities  that
own or lease buildings—and are not subject to building and fire safety code re-
quirements  of  any  governmental  jurisdiction—should  provide  a  level  of  safety
that  equals  or  exceeds  the  level  of  safety  that  would  be  provided  by  strict  com-
pliance with the code requirements of an appropriate governmental jurisdiction.
To  gain  broad  public  confidence  in  the  safety  of  such  buildings,  NIST  further
recommends  that  as-designed  and  as-built  safety  be  certified  by  a  qualified
third  party,  independent  of  the  building  owner(s).  The  process  should  not  use
self-approval for code enforcement in areas including interpretation of code pro-
visions,  design  approval,  product  acceptance,  certification  of  the  final  construc-
tion, and post-occupancy inspections over the life of the buildings.
Recommendation  26.  NIST  recommends  that  state  and  local  jurisdictions
adopt  and  aggressively  enforce  available  provisions  in  building  codes  to  ensure
that  egress  and  sprinkler  requirements  are  met  by  existing  buildings.  Further,
occupancy  requirements  should  be  modified  where  needed  (such  as  when  there
are  assembly  use  spaces  within  an  office  building)  to  meet  the  requirements  in
model building codes.
Recommendation  27.  NIST  recommends  that  building  codes  should  incor-
porate a provision that requires building owners to retain documents, including
supporting  calculations  and  test  data,  related  to  building  design,  construction,
maintenance  and  modifications  over  the  entire  life  of  the  building.3 Means
should  be  developed  for  offsite  storage  and  maintenance  of  the  documents.  In
addition, NIST recommends that relevant building information should be made
available  in  suitably  designed  hard  copy  or  electronic  format  for  use  by  emer-
gency  responders.  Such  information  should  be  easily  accessible  by  responders
during emergencies.

2 A  group  of  individuals  that  is  knowledgeable,  experienced,  and  specifically  trained  in  gath-
ering,  processing,  and  delivering  information  critical  for  emergency  response  operations  and  is
ready for activation in large and/or dangerous events.

3 The  availability  of  inexpensive  electronic  storage  media  and  tools  for  creating  large  search-

able databases make this feasible.

48

Recommendation  28.  NIST  recommends  that  the  role  of  the  ‘‘Design  Profes-
sional  in  Responsible  Charge’’ 4 be  clarified  to  ensure  that:  (1)  all  appropriate
design professionals (including, e.g., the fire protection engineer) are part of the
design team providing the standard of care when designing buildings employing
innovative or unusual fire safety systems, and (2) all appropriate design profes-
sionals (including, e.g., the structural engineer and the fire protection engineer)
are  part  of  the  design  team  providing  the  standard  of  care  when  designing  the
structure  to  resist  fires,  in  buildings  that  employ  innovative  or  unusual  struc-
tural and fire safety systems.

Group 8. Education and Training

The professional skills of building and fire safety professionals should be
upgraded  though  a  national  education  and  training  effort  for  fire  protec-
tion engineers, structural engineers, and architects. The skills of the build-
ing  regulatory  and  fire  service  personnel  should  also  be  upgraded  to  pro-
vide  sufficient  understanding  and  the  necessary  skills  to  conduct  the  re-
view, inspection, and approval tasks for which they are responsible.

Recommendation  29.  NIST  recommends  that  continuing  education  curricula
be  developed  and  programs  should  be  implemented  for  (1)  training  fire  protec-
tion  engineers  and  architects  in  structural  engineering  principles  and  design,
and  (2)  training  structural  engineers,  architects,  fire  protection  engineers,  and
code enforcement officials in modern fire protection principles and technologies,
including  fire-resistance  design  of  structures,  and  (3)  training  building  regu-
latory  and  fire  service  personnel  to  upgrade  their  understanding  and  skills  to
conduct  the  review,  inspection,  and  approval  tasks  for  which  they  are  respon-
sible.
Recommendation  30.  NIST  recommends  that  academic,  professional  short-
course,  and  web-based  training  materials  in  the  use  of  computational  fire  dy-
namics  and  thermostructural  analysis  tools  be  developed  and  delivered  to
strengthen the base of available technical capabilities and human resources.

BIOGRAPHY FOR WILLIAM JEFFREY

William  Jeffrey  is  the  13th  Director  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and
Technology  (NIST),  sworn  into  the  office  on  July  26,  2005.  He  was  nominated  by
President  Bush  on  May  25,  2005,  and  confirmed  by  the  U.S.  Senate  on  July  22,
2005.

As Director of NIST, Dr. Jeffrey oversees an array of programs that support U.S.
industry  and  science  with  measurement  research,  standards,  technology,  and  tech-
nical assistance that strengthen the Nation’s innovation infrastructure and competi-
tiveness. The goal is to improve manufacturing, services, trade, safety and security,
and quality of life. Operating in fiscal year 2005 on a budget of about $858 million,
NIST  is  headquartered  in  Gaithersburg,  Md.,  and  has  additional  laboratories  in
Boulder,  Colo.  NIST  also  jointly  operates  research  organizations  in  three  locations,
which  support  world-class  physics,  cutting-edge  biotechnology,  and  environmental

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  NANCY  MCNABB,  DIRECTOR  OF  GOVERN-

MENT AFFAIRS, NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION
Ms. MCNABB. Good morning, Chairman Boehlert, and Committee
Members.  My  name  is  Nancy  McNabb,  and  I  am  Director  for  Gov-
ernment  Affairs  for  NFPA,  the  National  Fire  Protection  Associa-
tion, headquartered in Quincy, Massachusetts. I am an architect li-
censed  in  the  great  State  of  New  York,  and  was  formerly  the  As-
sistant  Director  for  Code  Development  and  Interpretation  there.  I
appreciate  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Committee  this  morning
regarding  the  report  of  the  National  Construction  Safety  Team  on
the  collapse  of  the  World  Trade  Center  towers.  Dr.  Jeffrey  and  his
team at the NIST labs have done outstanding work.

NFPA  is  a  109-year-old  private,  nonprofit  organization  whose
mission  is  to  reduce  the  burden  of  fire  and  other  hazards  on  the
quality  of  life.  We  achieve  that  mission  by  advocating  consensus,
codes,  and  standards,  research,  training,  and  education.  We  have
approximately  79,000  members  that  come  from  80  nations  around
the world.

I am here today to affirm our support for the efforts of NIST re-
garding their report. In most cases, resolution and implementation
of their recommendations will be a long-term process. We have pro-
vided  the  Committee  with  copies  of  our  detailed  responses  to  the
NIST study, portions of which I will speak to today.

The  NIST  report,  the  second  issued  under  the  authority  of  the
National  Construction  Safety  Team  Act,  shows  that  NIST  is  com-
mitted  to  providing  a  high  level  of  scientific  data  and  a  set  of  rec-
ommendations  for  future  consideration  by  codes  and  standards  de-
velopers. NFPA is pleased to see the work effort of NIST resulting
in  positions  on  many  controversial  and  sometimes  unpopular  sub-
jects.  However,  the  need  to  conduct  more  research  in  numerous
areas is clear.

The  loss  of  the  World  Trade  Center  complex  represents  an  un-
usual set of building performance circumstances, both independent
and interdependent. Fundamental questions, such as why did each
tower remain standing after the initial impacts, what factors influ-
enced  the  collapse  of  the  two  towers,  and  what  features  either  al-
lowed  so  many  occupants  to  escape,  or  prevented  occupants  from
escaping,  now  have  some  answers.  Other  difficult  and  anguishing
questions,  such  as  what  was  the  fate  of  mobility-impaired  occu-
pants,  and  why  were  the  local  communication  systems  over-
whelmed, and did this prevent or delay evacuation warnings to the
first responders, at least now have some explanation.

In June of 2002, when the intensive three-year Federal Building
and  Fire  Safety  Investigation  of  the  World  Trade  Center  Disaster
was  initiated,  our  President  and  CEO,  Jim  Shannon,  testified  at  a
public hearing held in New York City that outlined the NIST objec-
tives for their work plan, investigation approach, and intended out-
comes. It would have been easy for the Federal Government to sim-
ply say this was a one time extreme event, or we do not or cannot
design  buildings  for,  or  learn  anything  new  from  such  extraor-
dinary events. But that would be contrary to how the U.S. conducts
its  business,  and  how  NFPA  identifies  needs  and  emerging  issues
for  the  development  of  new  and  improved  safety  codes  and  stand-
ards.  Let  me  assure  you  that  NIST  has  accomplished  a  great  deal
with their studies, analyses, and recommendations.

Even those skeptics and critics of NIST and its report in the end
chose to submit constructive comments. The National Construction
Safety  Team  Federal  Advisory  Committee,  who  provided  guidance
to NIST during the investigation, the engineers and scientists from
NIST who provided support to this effort, and the group of private
organizations who served as contractors to NIST on various aspects
of  the  project,  are  to  be  commended.  They  have  provided  a  con-
vincing amount of evidence, rigorous analyses, hypotheses, and con-
firmation.

One critical test of effectiveness of the World Trade Center study
will  be  what  will  happen  with  the  30  specific  recommendations  in
the  final  report.  Some  of  them  have  already  been  implemented  in
several  NFPA  codes.  This  was  possible  because  of  the  open  ap-
proach  that  NIST  took  with  the  investigation.  In  particular,  Dr.
Sunder’s  commitment  to  provide  public  briefings,  opportunities  for
input  during  media  briefings  and  open  meetings,  and  making  crit-
ical  information  available  on  the  NIST  World  Trade  Center
website.  While  some  changes  have  been  made,  it  is  important  to
note that it is likely that after a thorough and detailed analysis of
the final recommendations, there may not be sufficient data, detail,
or compelling evidence to promulgate a change to a particular safe-
ty code or standard.

For  example,  the  ongoing  debate  about  whether  building  regula-
tions  should  address  events  associated  with  normal  building  haz-
ards  or  more  extreme  events  such  as  hostile  acts  and  explosions,
and what category of buildings should have these unique measures
imposed  upon  them,  will  have  to  be  settled  before  consensus  is
reached on many of the recommendations and findings.

Because  of  this  study,  NFPA  codes  and  standards  have  been
changed to include a number of things. A few are hourly fire resist-
ance  ratings  of  three  and  four-hour  duration  for  tall  buildings,  re-
quirements for wider stairs to address counterflow issues based on
occupant  load,  and  integration  of  performance-based  design  op-
tions.  A  number  of  long-term  initiatives  are  also  underway  to  ad-
dress  other  subjects,  including  the  protocols  used  to  evaluate  the
performance  of  building  structural  systems  under  fire  conditions.
Although  NIST  has  not  indicated  that  the  current  procedures  are
inadequate,  a  review  of  the  test  methods  and  structural  system
evaluations is warranted.

One  recommendation  that  should  receive  a  high  priority  is  the
consideration  for  elevator  use  in  high  rise  emergency  evacuations.

NIST  has  led  the  effort  in  this  area,  with  participation  from  the
private sector, to establish the circumstances and criteria for mak-
ing  this  a  reality.  And  again,  I  have  given  you  some  of  NFPA’s
comments  on  NIST’s  report,  and  a  list  of  the  changes  already  af-
fected by NFPA.

Beyond  this,  several  of  the  recommendations  refer  to  specific
identification  and  quantification  of  multiple  threats  or  hazards.
This implies the need for risk and hazard analyses, and the utiliza-
tion  of  performance-based  design  techniques.  Overall,  NFPA  sup-
ports these concepts for building and fire regulations. However, the
design  of  buildings,  the  assessment  of  the  existing  building  stock,
and the preparation of emergency response plans, must be an inte-
gral part of our collective mindset.

While  NFPA  recognizes  the  benefits  of  risk  and  hazard  analyses
and performance-based design, we note that many of the tools and
data  necessary  to  do  this  on  a  routine  basis  are  not  yet  available,
nor  are  they  sufficiently  understood  by  all  the  parties  that  rou-
tinely make decisions about building construction, occupant safety,
and  emergency  responder  operations.  We  have  to  make  sure  that
those  who  live  or  work  in  a  high  rise,  those  who  design  and  con-
struct  a  high  rise,  and  those  that  come  to  our  aid  in  a  high  rise,
are  aware  of  the  limitations  of  our  technology,  procedures,  and
codes.

While it is too early to establish the lessons learned from the re-
port,  we  have  made  a  significant  start.  We  have  much  yet  to  be
done.  Before  we  arrive  at  an  appropriate  best  practices  that  will
advance  the  level  of  safety  in  the  built  environment,  more  evalua-
tion is necessary.

I  can  assure  you  that  NFPA  will  continue  to  be  thorough  in  re-
viewing,  evaluating,  and  implementing  those  NIST  recommenda-
tions  that  are  directed  at  the  broad  issue  of  public  and  first  re-
sponder  safety.  After  the  comprehensive  study  that  NIST  has  pro-
vided  to  us,  to  learn  nothing  and  do  nothing  would  be  delinquent.
Likewise, it would be unthinkable if the private sector fails to act
with due regard for these recommendations, and if our government
institutions,  such  as  the  General  Services  Administration,  fail  to
recognize the opportunities to develop new building safety enhance-
ments.  NIST  has  provided  us  with  a  public  service  and  a  tremen-
dous  resource.  It  will  be  up  to  all  of  us  to  make  certain  that  we
do  not  waste  this  unique  opportunity  to  ask  ourselves  new  ques-
tions,  learn  lessons,  and  develop  better  building  safety  codes  and
standards.

Thank  you  again  for  allowing  me  the  opportunity  to  present  the
views  of  NFPA  this  morning.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  ques-
tions you may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF NANCY MCNABB

Shyam  Sunder,  Dr.  William  Grosshandler  and  their  teams  at  the  NIST  labs  have
done outstanding work.

NFPA  is  a  109-year-old,  private,  non-profit  organization  whose  mission  is  to  re-
duce  the  burden  of  fire  and  other  hazards  on  the  quality  of  life.  We  achieve  that
mission  by  advocating  consensus  codes  and  standards,  research,  training  and  edu-
cation.  We  have  approximately  79,000  members  that  come  from  80  nations  around
the world.

I  am  here  today  to  affirm  our  support  for  the  efforts  of  NIST  regarding  their  re-
port.  In  most  cases,  resolution  and  implementation  of  their  recommendations  will
be a long-term process. We have provided the Committee with copies of our detailed
responses to the NIST study, portions of which I will speak to today.

On September 11, 2001, we witnessed the most terrible acts of violence ever com-
mitted  in  our  country.  The  destruction  of  the  WTC  towers,  the  large  loss  of  life  of
building occupants and first responders demands answers from the Federal Govern-
ment. The first effort directed at this loss included the Building Performance Study
(BPS) that was conducted by FEMA. NFPA participated as a team member in order
to  contribute  to  the  collection,  observation  and  recommendations  process  sur-
rounding the sequence of events and triggering mechanisms that resulted in the cat-
astrophic building failures and loss of so many lives.

The FEMA study, completed in just eight months, established a series of prelimi-
nary  observations  including  credible  theories,  hypotheses  and  a  likely  sequence  of
events  that  led  to  the  progressive  collapse  of  WTC  1,  2  and  7.  As  thorough  as  the
FEMA  BPS  report  was,  almost  every  preliminary  recommendation  needed  addi-
tional study. This committee recognized the need to take action and passed the Na-
tional  Construction  Safety  Team  Act  under  Public  Law  107–231  (NCSTA)  in  2002
authorizing  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  NIST,  as  the  re-
sponsible  agency.  Congress  selected  the  premier  government  scientific  institution
that has the capability, resources and the capacity to conduct complex building loss
investigations.

The report, the second issued under the authority of the NCST, shows that NIST
is  committed  to  providing  a  high  level  of  scientific  data  and  a  set  of  recommenda-
tions  for  future  consideration  by  codes  and  standards  developers.  NFPA  is  pleased
to  see  the  work  effort  of  NIST  resulting  in  positions  on  many  controversial  and
sometimes,  unpopular  subjects.  However,  the  need  to  conduct  more  research  in  nu-
merous areas is clear.

The  loss  of  the  WTC  complex  represents  an  unusual  set  of  building  performance
circumstances,  both  independent  and  interdependent.  Fundamental  questions  such
as  why  did  each  tower  remain  standing  after  the  initial  aircraft  impacts,  what  fac-
tors  influenced  the  collapse  of  the  two  towers  and  what  features  either  allowed  so
many occupants to escape or prevented occupants from escaping now have some an-
swers. Other difficult and anguishing questions such as what was the fate of mobil-
ity  impaired  occupants,  and  why  were  the  local  communication  systems  over-
whelmed and did this prevent or delay evacuation warnings to the first responders,
at least now we have some explanation.

In June of 2002, when the intensive, three year Federal Building and Fire Safety
Investigation  of  the  World  Trade  Center  Disaster  was  initiated,  our  President  and
CEO,  Jim  Shannon,  testified  at  a  public  hearing  held  in  New  York  City  that  out-
lined the NIST objectives for their work plan, investigation approach, and intended
outcomes. It would have been easy for the Federal Government to simply say ‘‘This
was  a  one  time,  extreme  event,’’  or  ‘‘We  do  not,  nor  cannot  design  buildings  for,  or
learn  anything  new  from  such  extraordinary  events,’’  but  that  would  be  contrary  to
how  the  U.S.  conducts  its  business  and  how  NFPA  identifies  needs  and  emerging
issues for the development of new and improved safety codes and standards. Let me
assure  you  that  NIST  has  accomplished  a  great  deal  with  their  studies,  analyses
and recommendations.

Even those skeptics and critics of NIST and its report in the end chose to submit
constructive comments. The NCST Federal Advisory Committee, who provided guid-
ance to NIST during the investigation, the engineers and scientists from NIST who
provided  support  to  this  effort,  and  the  group  of  private  organizations  who  served
as contractors to NIST on various aspects of the project are to be commended. They
have  provided  a  convincing  amount  of  evidence,  rigorous  analyses,  hypotheses  and
confirmation.

One  critical  test  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  WTC  study  will  be  what  will  happen
with the 30 specific recommendations in the final report. Some of them have already
been implemented in several NFPA codes. This was possible because of the open ap-
proach  that  NIST  took  with  the  investigation.  In  particular,  Dr.  Sunder’s  commit-
ment to provide public briefings, opportunities for input during media briefings and
open meetings and making critical information available on the NIST WTC website.

While  some  changes  have  been  made,  it  is  important  to  note  that  it  is  likely,  that
after a thorough and detailed analysis of the final recommendations, there may not
be  sufficient  data,  detail  or  compelling  evidence  to  promulgate  a  change  to  a  par-
ticular safety code or standard.

For  example,  the  on-going  debate  about  whether  building  regulations  should  ad-
dress events associated with normal building hazards, or more extreme events such
as  hostile  acts  and  explosions,  and  what  category  of  buildings  should  have  these
unique  measures  imposed  on  them,  will  have  to  be  settled  before  consensus  is
reached on many of the recommendations and findings.

Because  of  this  study,  NFPA  codes  and  standards  have  been  changed  to  include:

• Integration of performance-based design options.
• Retroactive  requirements  for  installation  of  automatic  sprinkler  systems  in

high rise buildings.

• Hourly  fire  resistance  ratings  of  three-hour  and  four-hour  duration  for  tall

• Integration of the structural frame approach when determining fire resistance

• Requirements  for  wider  stairs  to  address  counterflow  issues  based  on  occu-

buildings.

• Mandates for the Installation of stair descent devices for persons with mobil-

A number of long-term initiatives are also underway to address other subjects in-
cluding  the  protocols  used  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  building  structural  sys-
tems under fire conditions. Although NIST has not indicated that the current proce-
dures  are  inadequate,  a  review  of  the  test  methods  and  structural  system  evalua-
tions is warranted.

One  recommendation  that  should  receive  a  high  priority  is  the  consideration  for
elevator use in high rise emergency evacuations. NIST has led the effort in this area
with  participation  the  private  sector  to  establish  the  circumstances  and  criteria  for
making this a reality.

Exhibit  A  provides  you  with  NFPA’s  comments  to  NIST’s  NCSTAR1  Report;  Ex-
hibit  B  contains  a  summary  of  changes  already  effected  by  NFPA  because  of  the
NIST study, or that are in progress at some level.

Beyond  this,  several  of  the  recommendations  refer  to  specific  identification  and
quantification of multiple threats or hazards. This implies the need for risk and haz-
ard  analyses,  and  the  utilization  of  performance-based  design  techniques.  Overall,
NFPA  supports  these  concepts  building  and  fire  regulations.  However,  the  design
of  buildings,  the  assessment  of  the  existing  building  stock,  and  the  preparation  of
emergency response plans, must be an integral part of our collective mind set.

While NFPA recognizes the benefits of risk and hazard analyses and performance-
based  design,  we  note  that  many  of  the  tools  and  data  necessary  to  do  this  on  a
routine  basis  are  not  yet  available.  Nor  are  they  sufficiently  understood  by  all  par-
ties  that  routinely  make  decisions  about  building  construction,  occupant  safety  and
emergency responder operations. We have to make sure that those who live or work
in  a  high  rise,  those  who  design  and  construct  a  high  rise  and  those  that  come  to
our aid in a high rise are aware of the limitations of our technology, procedures and
codes.

While  it  is  too  early  to  establish  the  lessons  learned  from  the  report,  we  have
made  a  significant  start.  We  have  much  yet  to  be  done.  Before  we  arrive  at  an  ap-
propriate  ‘‘best  practices’’  that  will  advance  the  level  of  safety  in  the  built  environ-
ment more evaluation is necessary.

I can assure you that NFPA will continue to be thorough in reviewing, evaluating
and implementing those NIST recommendations that are directed at the broad issue
of  public  and  first  responder  safety.  After  the  comprehensive  study  that  NIST  has
provided to us, to learn nothing and do nothing would be delinquent.

Likewise, it would be unthinkable if the private sector fails to act with due regard
for these recommendations, and if our government institutions, such as the General
Services  Administration,  fail  to  recognize  the  opportunities  to  develop  new  building
safety enhancements. NIST has provided us with a public service and a tremendous
resource. It will be up to all of us to make certain that we do not waste this unique
opportunity  to  ask  ourselves  new  questions,  learn  lessons  and  develop  better  build-
ing safety codes and standards.

Thank  you  again  for  allowing  me  the  opportunity  to  present  the  views  of  NFPA

this morning. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES R. HARRIS, PRESIDENT, J.R.

HARRIS & COMPANY

Dr.  HARRIS.  Good  morning.  I  am  pleased  to  appear  on  behalf  of
the  Structural  Engineering  Institute  of  the  American  Society  of
Civil  Engineers  as  you  consider  these  recommendations  made  by
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  arising  from
their study of the events at the World Trade Center.

ASCE/SEI has a robust program of national voluntary standards
produced  under  a  consensus  process  accredited  by  the  American
National  Standards  Institute.  Changes  in  some  of  our  standards
are  already  underway  that  address  a  few  of  NIST’s  recommenda-
tions,  and  we  plan  to  give  each  recommendation  that  is  pertinent
to the scope of our standards careful consideration.

My  name  is  James  Harris.  I  am  President  of  a  structural  con-
sulting  firm  in  Denver,  Colorado.  I  have  long  been  involved  in  the
development  of  standards  for  structural  engineering  practice  here
in the U.S. as well as internationally. I have chaired the ASCE/SEI
committee  that  prepares  the  standard  ASCE  7  Minimum  Design
Loads  for  Buildings  and  Other  Structures  for  the  last  three  edi-
tions. I am also a member of the American Concrete Institute Com-
mittee  that  prepares  the  standard  for  the  design  of  building  struc-
tures, and the American Institute of Steel Construction Committee
that prepares the standard for the design of steel buildings.

ASCE/SEI  commends  NIST  for  their  thorough  study  and  for  the
thought-provoking  findings  and  recommendations.  We  also  com-
mend  the  Congress  for  providing  the  funding  for  this  worthwhile
study. Even though the first lesson of September 11 is to direct re-
sources  to  prevention  of  such  attacks,  we  see  important  lessons
from  this  tragedy  for  improving  the  performance  of  buildings  in
emergencies that are more ordinary than the attacks of September
11.

ASCE  supports  careful  consideration  of  all  of  NIST’s  rec-
ommendations  by  the  broad  community  that  develops  standards
and  building  codes  for  this  country.  NIST’s  study  built  upon  and

extended  the  work  of  the  Building  Performance  Study  Team  that
ASCE formed and FEMA supported immediately after the tragedy,
and which produced their report in 2002.

The  detail  of  NIST’s  study  commands  respect,  and  the  events  at
the  World  Trade  Center,  as  well  as  at  the  Pentagon  that  day  de-
mand our attention. The standard ASCE 7 has long included provi-
sions  for,  or  guidelines  for  resistance  to  progressive  collapse  in  its
commentary.  We  look  forward  to  improving  the  technology  for  as-
sessing  such  resistance  in  the  process  of  building  design.  We  will
also  participate  with  interested  stakeholders  in  addressing  the  ex-
tent  to  which  such  properties  should  become  mandatory  require-
ments.

ASCE is close to issuing a draft for public comment of a standard
for  wind  tunnel  testing  that  will  address  some  aspects  of  NIST’s
second  recommendation.  More  work  on  building  a  wind  resistant
infrastructure  is  needed,  as  shown  by  recent  hurricanes,  and  we
urge  the  Congress  to  fund  the  recently  authorized  National  Wind-
storm Mitigation Program. ASCE and the Society of Fire Protection
Engineers  are  issuing  a  new  edition  of  their  joint  standard  on  cal-
culation  methods  for  structural  fire  protection.  ASCE  is  also  pre-
paring a new standard for blast loading on building structures, and
we are participating in the panel being formed by the National In-
stitute  of  Building  Sciences  that  will  look  into  implementation  of
all of the NIST recommendations.

We do see some risks if NIBS or NIST elect to bypass the stand-
ards upon which building codes rely by submitting changes directly
to the major model building codes. Although the standards process
takes considerable time, it builds a consensus of all affected stake-
holders. A risk to be considered is backlash if change proposals are
made  without  the  necessary  broad  consensus.  Some  of  the  rec-
ommendations  will  need  considerable  refinement  on  the  thorny
issue  of  dividing  the  population  of  buildings  into  classes  for  which
certain new requirements will apply.

Some  of  the  other  recommendations  will  require  considerable
time  to  develop  a  knowledge  base  in  the  affected  professions.  We
see  the  NIBS  panel  as  an  important  vehicle  to  coordinate  actions
in a fashion to avoid negative concerns. We also believe that NIST
should  continue  their  studies.  More  information  is  needed  on  the
performance  of  fire  insulation  under  various  environments,  and  on
the various fire scenarios that would be used in performance-based
design of structures for fire resistance.

In  conclusion,  we  welcome  the  opportunity  to  further  the  im-
provement of building safety, and we caution that the work to come
will  take  more  time  than  might  seem  necessary,  now  that  the
major study by NIST has been completed.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMES R. HARRIS

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

Good  morning.  My  name  is  James  Harris,  and  I  am  pleased  to  appear  on  behalf
of  the  Structural  Engineering  Institute  of  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers

(ASCE/SEI)1 as you examine ‘‘The Investigation of the World Trade Center Collapse:
Findings,  Recommendations,  and  Next  Steps’’  in  light  of  the  release  of  findings  and
recommendations  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  investiga-
tion.

The  events  at  the  World  Trade  Center  in  New  York  City  on  September  11,  2001,
were  the  worst  building  disasters  in  the  history  of  the  United  States.  The  National
Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  conducted  a  building  and  fire  safety  inves-
tigation  of  the  disaster  under  the  authority  of  the  National  Construction  Safety
Team  Act  (15  USC  7301  et  seq.).  As  a  result  of  its  WTC  Investigation,  on  June  23,
2005  NIST  issued  a  draft  report  with  recommendations,  and  invited  public  com-
ments on June 23, 2005.

ASCE/SEI  supports  a  thorough  review  and  deliberation  of  all  of  the  NIST  Rec-
ommendations  and  looks  forward  to  further  discussions  clarifying  the  situations  to
which the NIST Recommendations should apply.

ASCE/SEI  believes  that  engineers  must  avoid  over-optimistic  reassurances  about
building  safety,  and  agrees  that  increased  efforts  should  be  focused  on  preventing
terrorist  attacks.  That  said,  the  30  recommendations  presented  by  NIST  within
eight  categories  address  a  range  of  issues  that  we  at  ASCE/SEI  think  require  seri-
ous  discussion.  Many  of  the  recommendations  were  presented  by  NIST  as  ‘‘changes
to  codes  and  standards,’’  which  some  may  interpret  to  mean  that  the  painstaking
process  of  developing  consensus  code  and  standard  provisions  should  be  unreason-
ably accelerated. We believe that the consensus process, which is already underway
at  ASCE/SEI  for  some  of  the  concerns  NIST  has  raised,  is  essential  so  that  all  as-
pects  of  an  issue  can  be  considered.  All  of  the  issues  deserve  further  consideration
in that community.

In the view of ASCE/SEI, at least some of the NIST recommendations will require
development  of  new  technologies  and  close  examination  of  their  effects  upon  the
practice.  At  the  same  time,  the  existing  codes  and  standards  processes  that  are  al-
ready  in  place,  both  in  and  outside  ASCE/SEI,  provide  appropriate  mechanisms  for
advancing several of these discussions. Ultimately, the implementation of these rec-
ommendations  will  require  the  development  of  appropriate  thresholds  and  bounds
for their application. ASCE/SEI looks forward to taking an integral role in clarifying
the application of these recommendations.

In  fact,  some  of  the  NIST  recommendations  follow  actions  previously  initiated  by
ASCE/SEI.  For  example,  with  respect  to  Recommendation  #2,  ASCE/SEI  is  close  to
issuing  a  Wind  Tunnel  Testing  standard  and  anticipates  opening  it  for  public  com-
ment.  With  respect  to  Recommendation  #9,  ASCE/SEI  has  been  working  with  the
Society  of  Fire  Protection  Engineers,  and  has  already  prepared  a  draft  to  update
ASCE/SEI/SFPE  29–99  (Standard  Calculation  Methods  for  Structural  Fire  Protec-
tion), by incorporating performance-based fire resistant design. With regard to Rec-
ommendation  #27,  we  look  forward  to  engaging  ASCE’s  professional  practices  com-
mittee  for  comment  and  guidance,  though  our  initial  reaction  is  that  it  may  not  be
necessary  or  beneficial  to  all  parties  for  the  Engineer  of  Record  to  retain  all  docu-
ments  for  all  time;  our  preliminary  view  on  document  retention  is  that  the  owner
should retain the drawings.

ASCE/SEI  favors  the  development  of  tools  to  assist  engineers  in  addressing  the
issue of progressive collapse (Recommendation #1). The development of a consensus
document  providing  multiple  approaches  to  mitigating  progressive  collapse  would
benefit  the  profession  by  providing  concepts  and  techniques  upon  which  to  build.  It
is worth noting that GSA requirements have already advanced technology for evalu-
ating  progressive  collapse.  In  general,  ASCE/SEI  prefers  a  building-specific  and/or
owner-specific  approach  to  mitigating  progressive  collapse  rather  than  a  code-man-
dated requirement.

However,  also  with  respect  to  Recommendation  #1,  the  ASCE/SEI  reserves  judg-
ment on whether and how to develop standardized software to evaluate the suscepti-
bility of a particular structural system to progressive collapse. Not all buildings are
at  risk  of  being  exposed  to  the  type  of  events  commonly  associated  with  initiating
progressive  collapse.  This  NIST  recommendation  needs  study  of  its  application  and
its  effect  upon  the  profession  because  of  the  various  design  thresholds  involved.

1 ASCE, founded in 1852, is the country’s oldest national civil engineering organization. It rep-
resents  more  than  139,000  civil  engineers  in  private  practice,  government,  industry,  and  aca-
demia  who  are  dedicated  to  the  advancement  of  the  science  and  profession  of  civil  engineering.
ASCE  carried  out  Building  Performance  Assessments  of  the  World  Trade  Center,  the  Pentagon
and  the  Murrah  Federal  Building,  and  its  technical  assessments  following  earthquakes,  hurri-
canes, and other natural disasters. The New Orleans levee technical group includes representa-
tives  appointed  by  the  ASCE  Geo-Institute  and  ASCE  Coasts,  Oceans,  Ports,  and  Rivers  Insti-
tute. ASCE is a 501(c) (3) non-profit educational and professional society.

When  considering  possible  causation  events,  other,  non-structural,  solutions  are
sometimes effective. Having said that, we look forward to discussing who would de-
velop  and  maintain  the  potential  software,  who  would  distribute  it  and  who  would
take responsibility for training the profession in its use.

ASCE/SEI agrees that designing for fire performance of structures (Recommenda-
tions  #4–7)  needs  to  be  discussed  within  the  broad  engineering  profession,  and  is
interested  in  taking  an  active  role  in  supporting  studies  examining  these  rec-
ommendations.  A  draft  has  been  prepared  and  we  would  welcome  NIST’s  input  in
furthering  the  development  of  this  standard.  The  concept  embedded  in  Rec-
ommendation #8 of treating fire as a load case for structural design will necessitate
assumption  concerning  fire  protection  systems.  Their  historical  performance  will
need to be included in the discussions along with the technical and economic impact.
ASCE/SEI feels that some of the NIST recommendations need further clarification
and discussion. ASCE/SEI would like a clearer description of the rationale and moti-
vation  for  developing  limit  state  criteria  in  Recommendation  #3.  It  is  possible  that
serviceability, perception of motion issues, and existing seismic criteria on drift may
satisfy this recommendation. While much of Recommendation #25 appears to ASCE/
SEI  to  be  reasonable,  the  concept  of  certification  of  ‘‘as-designed  or  as-built’’  safety
needs  additional  discussion  and  understanding.  Without  further  understanding  of
the  envisioned  intent  of  this  recommendation,  its  implementation  may  face  numer-
ous  technical,  economic,  and  authoritative  hurdles.  Improving  safety  in  existing
buildings,  as  directed  in  Recommendation  #26,  is  certainly  a  laudable  goal  and  one
that  ASCE/SEI  supports.  While  the  existence  of  as-built  drawings  would  assist  in
the  rehabilitation  of  existing  structures  as  specified  in  Recommendation  #26,  a  re-
quirement  for  the  retention  of  a  broad  range  of  documents  would  not  improve  the
safety or performance of structures. Lastly, the roles of various professionals within
a  project  will  change  and  vary  from  project  to  project.  The  assignment  of  roles  and
responsibilities  is  an  issue  best  handled  by  the  contract  documents  rather  than
codes and standards, as proposed in Recommendation #28.

ASCE  also  supports  Recommendations  #29  and  #30  which  call  for  increased  con-
tinuing  professional  development  for  engineers  and  the  curriculum  be  expanded
strengthen  the  base  of  available  technical  capabilities  and  human  resources.  It  is
essential  that  practicing  civil  engineers  remain  current  with  issues  and  advance-
ments  in  technology.  ASCE  supports  the  attainment  of  a  Body  of  Knowledge  for
entry  into  the  practice  of  civil  engineering  at  the  professional  level.  The  Body  of
Knowledge prescribes the necessary depth and breadth of knowledge, skills, and at-
titudes  required  of  an  individual  entering  the  practice  of  civil  engineering  at  the
professional  level  in  the  21st  Century.  Establishing  innovative  solutions  to  protect
public health and safety requires coordination, training and sustained research and
development.

We  are  particularly  encouraged  by  the  recommendations  pertaining  to  education
and  we  enthusiastically  support  continuing  education  of  the  profession.  However,
specific  issues,  such  as  cross-training  of  fire  and  structural  engineering  profes-
sionals, need to be clarified in further discussions.

Our  profession  is  responsible  for  protecting  the  public  to  the  best  of  our  abilities
and  to  seek  new  technologies  to  help  us  meet  that  charge.  In  order  to  do  that,  we
feel it is important to draw a distinction between advancing the technology through
the  development  of  various  tools,  such  as  consensus  documents  on  progressive  col-
lapse  and  fire-structure  interaction,  and  potentially  adversely  affecting  the  profes-
sion  by  imposing  regulations  and  restricting  the  engineers’  freedom  to  develop  the
best  solution  for  each  individual  building  and  the  embedding  of  mandatory  provi-
sions in building codes.

While  not  every  NIST  recommendation  may  be  ready  for  enactment  as  is,  ASCE/
SEI is moving forward with discussion of the issues and their implications for struc-
tural engineering practice, and looks forward to working closely with NIST to clarify
the application of these recommendations.
NIST Recommendations Referenced:
Recommendation  1.  NIST  recommends  that:  (1)  progressive  collapse  should  be
prevented  in  buildings  through  the  development  and  nationwide  adoption  of  con-
sensus  standards  and  code  provisions,  along  with  the  tools  and  guidelines  needed
for their use in practice; and (2) a standard methodology should be developed—sup-
ported  by  analytical  design  tools  and  practical  design  guidance—to  reliably  predict
the  potential  for  complex  failures  in  structural  systems  subjected  to  multiple  haz-
ards.
Recommendation  2.  NIST  recommends  that  nationally  accepted  performance
standards  be  developed  for:  (1)  conducting  wind  tunnel  testing  of  prototype  struc-

59

tures  based  on  sound  technical  methods  that  result  in  repeatable  and  reproducible
results  among  testing  laboratories;  and  (2)  estimating  wind  loads  and  their  effects
on tall buildings for use in design, based on wind tunnel testing data and directional
wind speed data.
Recommendation 3. NIST recommends that an appropriate criterion should be de-
veloped  and  implemented  to  enhance  the  performance  of  tall  buildings  by  limiting
how  much  they  sway  under  lateral  load  design  conditions  (e.g.,  winds  and  earth-
quakes).
Recommendation  4.  NIST  recommends  evaluating,  and  where  needed  improving,
the  technical  basis  for  determining  appropriate  construction  classification  and  fire
rating requirements (especially for tall buildings greater than 20 stories in height)—
and making related code changes now as much as possible—by explicitly considering
factors including:

tural integrity;

pected occupancy of the building; and

the time required for burnout without local collapse;

• timely  access  by  emergency  responders  and  full  evacuation  of  occupants,  or
• the extent to which redundancy in active fire protection (sprinkler and stand-
pipe, fire alarm, and smoke management) systems should be credited for occu-
pant life safety;
• the  need  for  redundancy  in  fire  protection  systems  that  are  critical  to  struc-
• the  ability  of  the  structure  and  local  floor  systems  to  withstand  a  maximum
credible  fire  scenario  without  collapse,  recognizing  that  sprinklers  could  be
compromised, not operational, or non-existent;
• compartmentation  requirements  (e.g.,  12,000  ft2)  to  protect  the  structure,  in-
cluding  fire  rated  doors  and  automatic  enclosures,  and  limiting  air  supply
(e.g.,  thermally  resistant  window  assemblies)  to  retard  fire  spread  in  build-
ings with large, open floor plans;
• the impact of spaces containing unusually large fuel concentrations for the ex-
• the  extent  to  which  fire  control  systems,  including  suppression  by  automatic
or manual means, should be credited as part of the prevention of fire spread.
Recommendation  5.  NIST  recommends  that  the  technical  basis  for  the  century-
old  standard  for  fire  resistance  testing  of  components,  assemblies,  and  systems
should be improved through a national effort. Necessary guidance also should be de-
veloped  for  extrapolating  the  results  of  tested  assemblies  to  prototypical  building
systems.
Recommendation 6. NIST  recommends  the  development  of  criteria,  test  methods,
and  standards:  (1)  for  the  in-service  performance  of  spray-applied  fire  resistive  ma-
terials (SFRM, also commonly referred to as fireproofing or insulation) used to pro-
tect structural components; and (2) to ensure that these materials, as-installed, con-
form to conditions in tests used to establish the fire resistance rating of components,
assemblies, and systems.
Recommendation  7.  NIST  recommends  the  nationwide  adoption  and  use  of  the
‘‘structural frame’’ approach to fire resistance ratings.
Recommendation  8.  NIST  recommends  that  the  fire  resistance  of  structures
should be enhanced by requiring a performance objective that uncontrolled building
fires result in burnout without local or global collapse.
Recommendation 9. NIST recommends the development of: (1) performance-based
standards  and  code  provisions,  as  an  alternative  to  current  prescriptive  design
methods,  to  enable  the  design  and  retrofit  of  structures  to  resist  real  building  fire
conditions,  including  their  ability  to  achieve  the  performance  objective  of  burnout
without  structural  or  local  floor  collapse:  and  (2)  the  tools,  guidelines,  and  test
methods necessary to evaluate the fire performance of the structure as a whole sys-
tem.
Recommendation  25.  Non-governmental  and  quasi-governmental  entities  that
own  or  lease  buildings  and  are  not  subject  to  building  and  fire  safety  code  require-
ments of any governmental jurisdiction are nevertheless concerned about the safety
of  the  building  occupants  and  the  responding  emergency  personnel.  NIST  rec-
ommends  that  such  entities  should  be  encouraged  to  provide  a  level  of  safety  that
equals  or  exceeds  the  level  of  safety  that  would  be  provided  by  strict  compliance
with  the  code  requirements  of  an  appropriate  governmental  jurisdiction.  To  gain
broad  public  confidence  in  the  safety  of  such  buildings,  NIST  further  recommends

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

60

that  it  is  important  that  as-designed  and  as-built  safety  be  certified  by  a  qualified
third  party,  independent  of  the  building  owner(s).  The  process  should  not  use  self-
approval  for  code  enforcement  in  areas  including  interpretation  of  code  provisions,
design approval, product acceptance, certification of the final construction, and post-
occupancy inspections over the life of the buildings.
Recommendation  26.  NIST  recommends  that  State  and  local  jurisdictions  should
adopt and aggressively enforce available provisions in building codes to ensure that
egress and sprinkler requirements are met by existing buildings. Further, occupancy
requirements  should  be  modified  where  needed  (such  as  when  there  are  assembly
use  spaces  within  an  office  building)  to  meet  the  requirements  in  model  building
codes.
Recommendation  27.  NIST  recommends  that  building  codes  should  incorporate  a
provision  that  requires  building  owners  to  retain  documents,  including  supporting
calculations and test data, related to building design, construction, maintenance and
modifications over the entire life of the building. Means should be developed for off-
site storage and maintenance of the documents. In addition, NIST recommends that
relevant  building  information  should  be  made  available  in  suitably  designed  hard
copy or electronic format for use by emergency responders. Such information should
be easily accessible by responders during emergencies.
Recommendation  28.  NIST  recommend  that  the  role  of  the  ‘‘Design  Professional
in Responsible Charge’’ should be clarified to ensure that: (1) all appropriate design
professionals  (including,  e.g.,  the  fire  protection  engineer)  are  part  of  the  design
team providing the standard of care when designing buildings employing innovative
or  unusual  fire  safety  systems,  and  (2)  all  appropriate  design  professionals  (includ-
ing,  e.g.,  the  structural  engineer  and  the  fire  protection  engineer)  are  part  of  the
design  team  providing  the  standard  of  care  when  designing  the  structure  to  resist
fires, in buildings that employ innovative or unusual structural and fire safety sys-
tems.
Recommendation  29.  NIST  recommends  that  continuing  education  curricula
should  be  developed  and  programs  should  be  implemented  for  training  fire  protec-
tion  engineers  and  architects  in  structural  engineering  principles  and  design,  and
training  structural  engineers,  architects,  and  fire  protection  engineers  in  modern
fire  protection  principles  and  technologies,  including  fire-resistance  design  of  struc-
tures.
Recommendation 30. NIST  recommends  that  academic,  professional  short-course,
and  web-based  training  materials  in  the  use  of  computational  fire  dynamics  and
thermostructural analysis tools should be developed and delivered to strengthen the
base of available technical capabilities and human resources.

Jim  is  well  versed  in  structural  engineering  practice  and  research.  He  has  de-
signed  or  evaluated  hundreds  of  structures  ranging  from  dwellings  to  high-rise
buildings including industrial facilities, long spans, buildings in the highest seismic
zones,  excavation  bracing,  pile  and  pier  foundations,  vibration  issues,  and  renova-
tions  of  historic  buildings.  This  background  spans  nearly  all  types  of  construction
and  structural  materials  and  includes  responsibility  for  management  of  all  design
disciplines. His experience includes six years of full-time research. His research has
focused on the loading and response of structures, particularly earthquake and snow
loadings.  A  second  focus  is  on  improving  the  formulation  and  use  of  engineering
standards. He has written over 30 reports and journal articles on the results of his
research  and  practice.  He  is  an  active  member  of  several  committees  that  produce
national standards for structural engineering practice.

STATEMENT  OF  PROF.  GLENN  P.  CORBETT,  ASSISTANT  PRO-
FESSOR  OF  FIRE  SCIENCE,  JOHN  JAY  COLLEGE  OF  CRIMI-
NAL JUSTICE
Mr.  CORBETT.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert.  Chairman  Boeh-
lert and Members of the House Committee on Science, my name is
Glenn  Corbett.  I  want  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify
again before you concerning NIST and the World Trade Center dis-
aster investigation. Before I discuss the investigation, I would first
like  to  extend  my  thanks  to  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,  and  the
House  Science  Committee,  for  initiating  the  creation  of  the  Na-
tional  Construction  Safety  Team  Act,  and  shepherding  it  through
Congress to final approval by President Bush. The American public
is the beneficiary of this critical legislation, and will reap the bene-
fits of your labors through the savings of lives and the construction
of safer buildings.

Additionally,  I  must  also  note  that  although  I  am  a  Member  of
the Federal Advisory Committee to the National Construction Safe-
ty  Team,  I  do  not  speak  on  their  behalf.  My  testimony  represents
only  my  own  opinions.  I  recommend  that  the  House  Committee  on
Science  review  the  annual  reports  of  the  NCST  Advisory  Com-
mittee for details on their perspective.

Over three years have passed since NIST began its investigation
into  the  World  Trade  Center  disaster.  We  now  have  come  to  the
conclusion  of  this  $16  million  effort  of  a  search  for  answers  about
what  happened  in  the  twin  towers.  The  investigation  has  taken
much  longer  than  anticipated,  including  the  fact  that  the  World
Trade  Center  Building  Number  7  investigation  will  likely  not  be
completed until next summer.

Although  NIST  has  done  quite  a  bit  of  work  and  has  amassed
many  thousands  of  pages  of  useful  research,  I  feel  that  the  inves-
tigation has fallen far short of what is needed. From the beginning,
I had hoped for a true investigation with a tight set of specific rec-
ommendations at the conclusion, that could be immediately passed
to our national code writing groups and trade associations. Instead
of  passing  a  blazing  torch  of  detailed  recommendations,  this
lengthy marathon race has resulted in NIST giving our model code

writing  groups  only  a  handful  of  flickering  embers  that,  although
generally good in principle, are entirely too vague. The model code
writing  groups  now  have  to  wait  even  longer  while  NIST  hires  an
outside  organization  to  prepare  a  set  of  recommendations  that  ac-
tually can be assimilated into our construction codes.

During  the  course  of  the  WTC  investigation,  I  have  had  serious
concerns about some of the findings and conclusions that NIST has
drawn.  Other  individuals,  including  some  people  on  the  Federal
Advisory Committee, have also had concerns. While this hearing is
not  the  appropriate  place  to  debate  technical  issues,  I  would  sug-
gest  that  a  more  formal  mechanism  be  developed  to  officially  ad-
dress comments from the public. Such a protocol should include the
technical  basis  for  which  NIST  rejects  or  accepts  the  content  of  a
public comment.

Overall,  I  have  been  disappointed  by  the  lack  of  aggressiveness
that  has  characterized  not  only  the  World  Trade  Center  investiga-
tion, but the Rhode Island Station Nightclub investigation as well.
Instead of a gumshoe inquiry that has left no stone unturned, I be-
lieve the investigations were treated more like research projects, in
which  they  waited  for  information  to  flow  to  them.  In  both  inves-
tigations,  they  were  reluctant  to  use  the  subpoena  given  to  them
under the NCST Act. To some extent, this lack of assertiveness was
likely the result of legal opinions given to NIST by staff attorneys.
Recently,  this  situation  was  greatly  amplified  by  NIST’s  reluc-
tance to respond to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita under the banner
of the NCST Act. I suggested to NIST that they assemble an NCST
team  for  Katrina  before  it  struck  the  Gulf  Coast.  They  actually
sent a handful of people a week after Katrina hit, and only recently
sending a much larger group of researchers to the area. Curiously,
they have decided not to respond under the NCST Act.

To  their  credit,  NIST  has  brought  many  talented  people  to  the
WTC  investigation.  They  have  expended  a  tremendous  amount  of
effort, compiled a great deal of technical data, pushed the technical
limits  of  computer  models,  and  identified  the  general  areas  of  con-
cern  where  improvements  in  safety  regulation  and  practice  are
called  for.  They  are  to  be  commended  for  their  extraordinary  re-
search efforts, given the immensity of the project.

With  respect  to  the  30  recommendations  that  NIST  has  devel-
oped, despite being vague, they are areas of significant importance.
I feel the following particular ones deserve greater attention. These
recommendations  concern  enhanced  structural  fire  resistance,  re-
dundancy  for  fire  protection  systems  in  tall  buildings,  enhanced
egress capabilities, including dealing with stairwell counterflow, re-
moteness  of  exits,  and  full  building  evacuation  capacity,  hardened
elevators  for  egress,  as  well  as  robust  communication  capabilities
for emergency responders.

Where  do  we  go  from  here  with  regard  to  the  World  Trade  Cen-
ter?  The  ball  is  in  NIST’s  court,  and  it  is  up  to  them,  with  their
contractor,  to  quickly  whittle  the  desirable  but  too  general  rec-
ommendations  into  well-defined  code  language  that  can  be  quickly
moved through the model code review process. I strongly encourage
them to be bold, use their best engineering judgment, and come up
with  clear  and  concise  code  language.  High  rise  fire  safety  and
safety in general is held in the balance.

When  I  look  to  the  future  of  the  NCST  Act,  sadly,  I  find  it  nec-
essary to recommend that serious consideration be given to finding
a new agency to implement the Act. I don’t think that NIST is the
right  place  for  the  NCST.  Their  nonaggressiveness,  their  absence
of  investigative  instinct,  and  the  palatable  lack  of  interest  they
have  shown  in  the  Act  has  brought  me  to  this  conclusion.  NIST  is
an  organization  of  exceptional  scientists  and  engineers,  not  detec-
tives.

Short  of  creating  an  entirely  new  Construction  Safety  Team
Board,  I  would  recommend  that  serious  consideration  be  given  to
moving  the  NCST  to  the  U.S.  Chemical  Safety  and  Hazard  Inves-
tigation  Board.  They  are  a  close  fit.  They  investigate  explosions
and  chemical  disasters  in  and  around  structures.  They  deal  with
many of the same code writing bodies that NIST deals with, includ-
ing  some  of  the  organizations  represented  on  this  panel  today.
More  importantly,  they  are  solely  an  investigative  agency  that
issues recommendations. Perhaps their purview could be expanded
to include the NCST Act.

In  conclusion,  I  want  to  again  thank  you,  Chairman  Boehlert,
and the House Committee on Science, for taking the leadership role
in creating the NCST Act. The fact that it has drawn the attention
of  many  people  sitting  here  today,  and  the  organizations  included
on this panel today from the safety and construction fields, is a tes-
tament to its importance.

Thank you.

STATEMENT OF HENRY L. GREEN, PRESIDENT,

INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL (ICC)

Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning to you
and  the  distinguished  Members  of  this  committee.  It  is  indeed  a
pleasure  to  be  here  today  to  discuss  the  role  of  building  codes  and
standards  in  the  protection  of  the  public  through  enhanced  meas-
ures  in  building  safety.  I  am  Henry  Green,  President  of  the  Inter-
national  Code  Council,  and  immediate  past  chair  of  the  National
Institute of Building Sciences Board of Directors.

Through my testimony today, I hope to not only discuss how the
NIST  recommendations  can  be  employed  in  improving  building
safety across the country, but also to leave you with a broader un-
derstanding  of  the  International  Code  Council  and  its  role  in  pro-
tecting  the  public  health,  safety,  and  welfare  by  creating  better
codes and standards to make for better buildings and safer commu-
nities.

ICC,  as  you  may  be  aware,  is  the  product  of  a  consolidation  of
three regional code organizations, who came together at the urging
of public and private sector interests seeking a single set of nation-
ally  uniform  model  codes  for  use  in  this  country.  As  a  result,  the
ICC  now  provides  states  and  local  government  with  a  single  set  of
codes  upon  which  to  base  commercial  and  residential  building
standards for the safety of the public. It has also given the federal
sector a platform upon which to transition from the government de-
veloped standards to voluntary standards, as directed by OMB Cir-
cular  A–119  and  the  National  Technology  Transfer  and  Advance-
ment Act of 1995.

Today, virtually all states and localities using a model code adopt
codes developed and maintained through a governmental consensus
process  facilitated  by  the  International  Code  Council.  The  codes
bind  together  hundreds  of  building  standards  developed  by  vol-
untary sector standard developers, including many of those on this
panel,  and  NFPA,  ASTM,  ASCE,  ASHRAE,  and  others.  The  codes
provide  the  administrative  and  technical  language  necessary  for
meaningful  and  consistent  adoption  and  code  enforcement  and  re-
sults  in  the  protection  of  the  public’s  health,  safety,  and  welfare.
Because  we  are  all  focused  on  disaster  response,  I  would  like  to
take  a  moment,  if  I  may,  to  address  concerns  regarding  the  con-
struction  codes  and  standards  as  they  relate  to  the  recent  disaster
resulting  from  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita  and  now,  Wilma.  As
demonstrated in the hurricane that struck Florida over a year ago,
and from earlier high wind events that have caused devastation in
the United States, we have learned that compliance with codes and
standards  provide  benefits  in  securing  the  safety  of  the  public  in
the  built  environment,  as  well  as  reducing  mitigation  costs  in  re-
covery following these events.

ICC has worked with both federal and State agencies in assisting
in the recovery and rebuilding efforts in the Gulf region, and is es-
tablishing  a  resource  office  in  the  Gulf  region  to  assist  in  the  re-
building efforts. When codes and standards are used effectively, we
know  that  for  every  dollar  spent  in  prevention,  we  gain  a  residual
of $3 to $5 in savings in recovery efforts.

The  Committee  requested  a  brief  discussion  or  understanding  of
the  process  of  ICC,  of  how  ICC  facilitates  all  interests,  interested

parties in the preparation and the development of the international
codes.  While  I  would  enjoy  today  to  give  you  an  exhaustive  expla-
nation of that process, I am sure you wouldn’t sit through it, so we
will  forego  that.  My  extended  testimony  does,  however,  speak  to,
more to the point, for your reference. My oral remarks, may it suf-
fice  to  say  that  our  processes  both  predate  and  is  consistent  with
the principles embodied in NTTAA and the OMB A–119, as well as
internationally accepted practices, or principles in consensus devel-
opment.  As  with  any  democratic  process,  like  that  which  guides
this  body,  it  is  deliberative,  exhaustive  in  examination,  time-con-
suming,  and  requires  much  more  care  and  attention.  The  result  is
an  abiding  respect  for  both  the  process  and  the  resulting  quality
and  confidence  the  codes,  in  the  codes  that  our  members  produce.
I  would  like  to  proceed  to  the  questions  that  have  actually  been
posed  by  this  panel,  and  respond  to  those.  Does  ICC  support  the
recommendations of the NIST study? Events such as the structural
failure  of  the  World  Trade  Center  shake  to  our  core  our  faith  in
science,  engineering  standards,  and  means  of  ensuring  building
safety that we use to protect our lives, our property, and our econ-
omy.  The  ICC  has  worked  with  NIST  in  examining  the  collapse  of
the  World  Trade  Center  and  the  development  of  recommendations
for  reform  of  the  Nation’s  building  and  fire  codes  and  standards.
We  have  acted  in  support  of  the  NIST  recommendations  by
empanelling  technical  committees  of  member  experts  to  prioritize
the  recommendations  and  prepare  specific  proposals  that  will  be
addressed  by  our  code  development  process.  Also  in  support  of  the
recommendations,  ICC  responded  to  NIST  requests  for  review  of
the document, the draft report, earlier with extensive comments di-
rected  at  assessing  NIST,  assisting  NIST  in  the  clarity  of  its  dis-
cussion and findings.

The  majority  of  NIST  recommendations  on  the  subject  of  codes
and  standards  do  apply  to  the  international  building  code.  Again,
I would reference you to my pre-filed remarks for a summary of our
specific  remarks  on  the  NIST  report.  It  should  be  noted  that  the
questions  posed  by  the  committee  is  focused  on  new  construction
and  significant  renovation  of  existing  buildings.  As  we  focus  on
code  reform,  we  should  not  ignore  the  needs  to  address  the  safety
of ongoing use of our massive base of existing building stock.

What specific steps will ICC be undertaking to determine wheth-
er  and  how  to  incorporate  the  NIST  recommendations  into  the
codes?  Some  of  the  steps  associated  with  the  NIST  recommenda-
tions, we have already begun. As a result of the World Trade Cen-
ter attacks, the ICC formed an ad hoc committee on terrorist resist-
ant  buildings.  The  committee,  made  up  of  code  officials,  engineers,
architects, and other building professionals, is looking at the NIST
work  and  other  research  in  response  to  new  threats  that  we  know
now have to perpetually address.

In  addition,  we  have  charged  our  permanent  Code  Technology
Committee  to  specifically  prioritize  the  NIST  recommendations,
and to prepare them as code change proposals. In the two days just
before  this  hearing,  our  Code  Technology  Committee  has  been
meeting  with  the  National  Institute  of  Building  Sciences  to  coordi-
nate  the  work  in  developing  and  preparing  proposals  based  upon
the NIST recommendations.

As  to  timing,  the  next  code  development  cycle  begins  with  a
deadline of March 24, 2006, for any interested party to submit code
changes.  Through  a  multi-stage  process  of  technical  committee  ex-
amination, two public hearings, and two stages of public notice and
comment,  final  action  on  those  proposals  in  the  fall  of  2007  will
yield the 2007 supplement to the 2006 international building code.
This  process  is  repeated  every  18  months,  resulting  in  a  new  edi-
tion  of  the  code  every  three  years,  and  a  new  supplement  in  each
interim.

The most significant barrier to adoption, as with any code change
proposal, is having technical documentation for the membership to
review the consideration of specific code changes and the advanced
use  of  formal  and  informal  processes  of  discussion  and  review,  to
fully vet and analyze each proposal.

What  specific  actions  will  NIST  be  taking  to  help  organizations
incorporate  its  recommendations?  It  is  our  view  that  NIST  and
other  federal  agencies  already  do  participate  in  the  code  develop-
ment  processes  through  submission  of  and  advocacy  of  code
changes.  This  participation  both  adds  to  the  quality  of  the  review
of  all  proposed  changes,  and  helps  the  agencies  to  achieve  their
program  goals,  as  directed  by  both  executive  and  legislative
branches of the government. This sort of federal interagency coordi-
nation  is  precisely  what  is  necessary  for  NIST  to  advance  the  rec-
ommendations of the WTC report.

The  NIST  recommendations  do  not  need  to  be  reframed  in  a
manner  that  is  consistent  with  the  statutory  construction  of  the
ICC  codes.  In  the  simplest  terms,  the  probability  of  a  code  change
being  accepted  or  eventually  incorporated  is  dependent  on  the  de-
gree to which the existing code is changed, first, and life-cycle cost
impact associated with the change, availability of any required new
technology,  and  support  infrastructure  for  the  technology,  impacts
on  various  trade,  labor,  and  manufacturing  interests,  and  prod-
uct—and impacts on the interests of advocacy groups. This process
is quite similar to what you use here in this legislative body to de-
velop law and/or other regulations.

ICC has recommended to NIST that it further partner with inter-
ested  and  affected  parties  in  the  development  of  codes  and  stand-
ard proposals, as opposed to taking up the effort alone, and assum-
ing  others  will  take  the  lead.  In  addition,  ICC  has  also  stressed  to
NIST  that  without  their  involvement  and  leadership  in  this  proc-
ess,  there  are  two  probable  outcomes:  either  nothing  can  be  done
to implement the WTC findings in codes and standards; or multiple
and varied interests will each use the findings to their own advan-
tage, resulting in multiple and varied non-uniform code and stand-
ards  proposals,  that  will  be  much  more  difficult  and  time-con-
suming.

With  that  said,  there  are  some  certainties  associated  with  the
process.  Changes  that  are  not  enforceable,  and  require  specific
products  or  materials  by  name,  are  not  likely  to  be  accepted,  nor
are  the  changes  that  reference  codes  and  standards  that  have  not
been fully completed. We at ICC applaud the work of Congress and
support  of  Congress  in  this  matter,  such  that  was  conducted  by
NIST. We encourage continued support for such work by Congress,

and increased collaboration by the public and private sectors in en-
hancing public performance and safety.

Finally,  I  would  like  to  quote  one  section  out  of  the  NIST  report
that  I  think  is  really  focused  on  the  issue  of  codes  and  standards.
‘‘Rigorous  enforcement  of  building  codes  and  standards  by  State
and  local  agencies,  well-trained  and  managed,  is  critical  in  order
for  standards  and  codes  to  ensure  the  effective  level  of  safety.  Un-
less  they  are  complied  with,  the  best  codes  and  standards  cannot
protect occupants and emergency responders or buildings.’’

Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today, and I would

be pleased to answer any questions that you might have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Green follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HENRY L. GREEN

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee.  It  is
a  pleasure  to  be  here  today  to  discuss  the  role  of  building  codes  and  standards  in
protecting the public through enhanced measures in building safety.

I  am  Henry  Green,  President  of  the  International  Code  Council  (ICC).  Through
my  testimony  I  hope  to  discuss  how  the  NIST  recommendations  can  be  employed
in improving building safety across the country, as well as leave you with a broader
understanding of how ICC is protecting health, safety and welfare by creating better
buildings  and  safer  communities.  Certainly  the  subject  of  today’s  hearing  and  the
ICC’s mission is well-aligned. Aside from my elected position with ICC, I also serve
as  the  Director  of  The  Bureau  of  Construction  Codes  and  Fire  Safety  for  the  State
of Michigan.

I  am  participating  in  today’s  hearing  to  specifically  address  the  implementation
of the lessons learned from the world trade center (WTC) collapse. In more general
terms  my  comments  also  apply  to  and  stress  the  need  for  increased  collaboration
between Federal, State and local government in the development, adoption and im-
plementation of codes and standards to enhance the safety and performance of new
and existing buildings.

As  a  matter  of  background,  I  have  been  involved  with  building  codes  and  stand-
ards  development,  adoption,  implementation  and  enforcement  issues  at  the  inter-
national,  national,  State  and  local  level  for  almost  30  years,  serving  not  only  ICC
but  such  organizations  as  the  National  Institute  of  Building  Sciences  (NIBS),  of
which  I  serve  as  Past  President.  Briefly,  before  I  speak  to  the  questions  the  Com-
mittee  has  asked  me  to  address,  I  will  lay  a  foundation  for  a  better  understanding
of ICC’s responses to those three specific questions.

State and local government have relied on nationally recognized model codes, and
the  standards  referenced  in  those  codes,  as  a  basis  for  their  building  construction
regulations  for  almost  100  years.  Initially  many  State  and  local  government  agen-
cies wrote their own ‘‘home grown’’ provisions but over time they began to rely more
and  more  on  one  of  four  regional  model  codes  (the  BOCA  National  Code,  the  ICBO
Uniform  Code  and  SBCCI  Standard  Code  and  the  National  Building  Code  of  the
American Insurance Association). The AIA ceased maintenance of its model code al-
most  30  years  ago  and  just  recently  the  three  other  model  code  organizations
merged  to  form  the  International  Code  Council  (ICC).  The  merger  of  the  three  re-
gional  organizations  came  at  the  urging  of  public  and  private  sector  interests  seek-
ing  a  single  nationally  uniform  model  building  code  developed  through  a  voluntary
consensus process. The development of one family of model codes by the ICC, which
in turn reference standards from hundreds of building standards developers such as
ASCE,  ASME,  and  ASTM,  has  provided  State  and  local  government  with  a  single
national consolidated family of model codes upon which to base commercial and resi-
dential  building  construction  and  fire  safety  regulations.  It  has  also  given  the  fed-
eral  sector  a  platform  upon  which  to  transition  from  government  developed  stand-
ards  to  voluntary  standards,  as  directed  by  OMB  Circular  A–119  and  the  National
Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995.

Today the majority of State and local agencies adopt building and fire codes devel-
oped and maintained through the governmental consensus process facilitated by the
ICC.  Think  of  these  model  codes  as  a  coordinated  set  of  provisions  that  bind  sepa-
rate  and  distinct  building  component  standards  so  they  can  fully  address  the  tech-
nical and administrative aspects of building safety and performance. In most states
I-Code  based  building  codes  are  required  and  enforced  as  a  function  of  State-level
authority.  In  others,  such  as  Tennessee,  Maryland,  Colorado  and  Illinois,  the  au-

thority  to  adopt  and  enforce  codes  primarily  resides  with  local  government,  and  in
those  states  most  all  local  governments  adopt  ICC  model  codes  to  guide  residential
and commercial construction.

In parallel to the events leading up to the formation of the ICC and development
of  the  ICC  codes,  the  federal  executive  and  legislative  branches  of  government  es-
tablished  the  groundwork  for  the  federal  sector  to  increasingly  base  their  building
regulations  on  nationally  recognized  model  building  codes  as  opposed  to  writing
their  own  unique  provisions.  As  a  matter  of  national  policy,  established  through
OMB  Circular  A–119  and  the  NTTAA,  all  federal  agencies  are  encouraged  to  use
codes  and  standards  developed  in  the  voluntary  sector  and,  equally  important,  to
participate  in  the  voluntary  sector  code  and  standards  development  processes.  This
policy  eliminates  the  duplication  of  effort  and  conflict  in  application  that  occurred
when  federal  agencies  developed  and  maintained  unique  government  standards.
This policy also enhances voluntary sector standards development by infusing those
processes with the experience and resources of federal agencies such as NIST.

This  federal  policy  also  saves  time  and  money  and  ensures  consistency  between
public  and  private  sector  construction.  Such  consistency  is  important  to  designers,
contractors,  manufacturers,  and  other  entities  doing  business  with  both  the  private
and  public  sectors.  Consistency  is  also  imperative  where  the  structure  in  question
is  a  private  sector  facility  that  is  leased  to  a  federal  agency.  Such  a  facility  must
concurrently  satisfy  federal  as  well  as  State  and  local  building  requirements.  Most
importantly,  federal  sector  use  of  voluntary  sector  codes  and  standards  allows  for
public-private partnerships that can bring the result of building research and expe-
rience  to  bear  on  revision  and  enhancement  to  those  codes  and  standards.  Such  is
the case with the NIST investigations associated with the WTC.

In  summary,  what  not  too  long  ago  was  a  ‘‘crazy  quilt’’  of  differing  federal,  State
and  local  requirements,  each  supported  by  separate  and  distinct  educational  and
other  programs,  has  become  a  tapestry  with  a  singular  foundation  that  involves
public  and  private  sector  interests  and  allows  for  unique  federal,  State  and  local
threads without compromising the quality of the fabric of the tapestry.

As  we  are  all  focused  on  disaster  response  I  would  also  like  to  take  a  moment
to address concerns regarding construction codes and standards as they relate to the
recent  disasters  resulting  from  Hurricanes  Katrina  and  Rita.  As  demonstrated  in
the  hurricane  that  struck  Florida  last  year  and  from  earlier  high  wind  events  that
have  caused  devastation  in  the  U.S.,  we  have  learned  that  compliance  with  codes
and standards provides benefits in securing the safety of the public in the built envi-
ronment, as well as reducing mitigation costs in recovery following these events.

ICC has pledged to work with both federal and State agencies in assisting in the
recovery  and  rebuilding  efforts  in  the  Gulf  region.  We  believe  our  effort  will  assist
in providing a higher level of safety not only from such devastating events as hurri-
canes  but  in  prevention  of  fires  and  other  situations  that  plague  our  built  environ-
ment. When codes and standards are used effectively, we know that for every dollar
spent  in  prevention  we  gain  a  residual  of  three  dollars  in  savings  in  recovery  cost.
We will be providing a resource office in the Gulf Region to assist in the rebuild-
ing  efforts  by  furnishing  local  governmental  and  code  officials  with  the  resources
they  need  to  assure  the  reconstruction  is  completed  to  a  standard  that  will  assist
in minimizing damage and recovery cost.

Given  our  experience  and  the  working  relationship  we  maintain  with  federal
agencies, we would like to expand our relationship and further develop safety provi-
sions for the protection of America’s citizens.

In  addition  to  responding  to  the  questions  regarding  the  NIST  WTC  report  that
the committee put to the ICC it was asked that in my testimony I provide the com-
mittee with a brief description of the code development process used by the member-
ship of the ICC to build and maintain each of the 14 model codes, and with an un-
derstanding  of  how  and  where  the  model  codes  are  adopted  by  authorities  having
jurisdiction over the adoption and enforcement of regulations impacting building de-
sign, construction and maintenance.

The  widespread  national  application  of  the  IBC  and  other  ICC  codes  is  due  in
large part to the recognition of respect for the voluntary consensus process by which
the codes are developed. They are developed in a democratic process with input and
advocacy  from  both  private  and  public  sector  building  and  fire  safety  interests  and
any  other  interested  or  affected  party.  ICC’s  governmental  consensus  process  ad-
heres  to  the  guiding  principles  at  the  national  and  international  level  for  develop-
ment of consensus documents. These principles—openness, transparency, balance of
interest, due process, consensus and process of appeals are embodied in the govern-
mental  consensus  process.  The  uniquely  notable  quality  of  the  governmental  con-
sensus process is that it leaves final determinations on code provisions in the hands

of  public  safety  officials,  who,  like  myself,  are  charged  with  representing  the  public
interest  and  have  no  commercial  interest  associated  with  the  outcome  the  process.
In  this  process  any  interested  party  can  submit  a  change  to  the  codes  or  request
that  a  new  code  be  developed.  All  submittals  are  published  and  made  available  for
public  review.  All  submittals  are  then  published  and  made  available  for  written
comment  and  discussed  at  nationally  noticed  public  hearings.  At  the  first  public
hearing a committee of balanced interests listens to all testimony, reviews all infor-
mation submitted on each proposal, then votes to recommend approval, rejection or
approval  with  modification.  If  any  party  at  the  hearing  disagrees  with  the  com-
mittee  recommendation  the  process  provides  for  action  by  those  at  the  hearing  to
make and democratically act on a proposal for a substitute motion.

The results of the first hearing, both the committee recommendation and any sub-
stitute assembly action are published and disseminated in print and electronic form.
Anyone can then submit a public comment on those results and provide documenta-
tion supporting a different outcome. The committee recommendation and additional
public  comment  is  again  published  and  becomes  the  basis  for  the  agenda  of  a  final
action hearing at which time the proposed changes and public comment are consid-
ered.  At  the  final  action  hearing  the  final  vote  on  code  content  is  made  by  public
safety  officials,  which,  not  unlike  the  legislative  and  regulatory  processes  used  to
establish  federal  law  and  regulations,  is  made  by  Federal,  State  and  local  govern-
ment representatives who represent the public-at-large.

The  IBC  and  other  ICC  codes  are  used  by  Federal,  State  and  local  government
to ensure building safety through the adoption, implementation and enforcement of
these codes. Nearly every federal, State and local agency that enacts building codes
has  adopted  the  IBC  as  the  basis  for  jurisdictionally  controlled  building  laws  and
regulations.  Jurisdictional  adoption  occurs  through  legislative  or  regulatory  action
that  cites  or  directly  incorporates  the  IBC  and  may  also  include  amendments  that
specifically  tailor  the  code  to  the  needs  of  the  adopting  agency  or  jurisdiction.  For
instance, the U.S. Department of State adopts the IBC as a basis for U.S. Embassy
construction  worldwide  but  then  adds  provisions  to  address  security  needs  unique
to a U.S. diplomatic facility.

States  such  as  Michigan,  Minnesota,  Maryland,  Washington,  New  York,  Oregon,
North  Carolina  and  Utah  have  authority  in  the  executive  branch  of  government  to
develop  and  adopt  a  state-wide  building  code  and  do  so,  again  with  amendments
that  tailor  the  IBC  to  address  unique  geographic  and  climatic  issues  and  differing
legal  and  administrative  environments.  In  states  without  authority  to  adopt  state-
wide  codes,  or  where  local  governments  are  not  required  to  adopt  the  state  code,
the state adopts codes for state-owned buildings and leaves regulation of private sec-
tor  construction  to  local  government.  This  is  the  case  in  states  such  as  Tennessee,
Colorado and Illinois with local government having the authority to adopt codes and
Maryland that has a state code but does not have preemptive authority to mandate
local government action to adopt and enforce the code. Just as is the case with state
adoption,  local  adoption  is  effected  through  local  elected  bodies  or  regulatory  agen-
cies.

Subsequent to adoption, the IBC is used to ensure building safety through a num-
ber  of  mechanisms,  each  of  which  are  focused  on  ensuring  that  the  requirements
of  the  code  are  actually  adhered  to  in  the  construction  of  the  building.  Adoption  of
the code can be viewed as establishing a speed limit for highway travel. Though the
limit is set, it is meaningless unless the limit is posted and enforced to ensure traf-
fic safety. So too, federal, State and local agencies have ways to ensure code compli-
ance  and,  as  a  result,  building  safety.  Note  that  the  IBC  not  only  contains  design
and  construction  requirements  but  also  a  number  of  administrative  criteria  associ-
ated with inspection to ensure compliance in the field.

In  the  case  of  an  agency  that  adopts  the  IBC  and  is  also  the  building  owner—
such  again  as  the  U.S.  Department  of  State,  or  State  or  local  government  agency
responsible for State or local owned construction—the adopting agency enforces the
code  and  typically  does  so  as  a  function  of  the  contracting  process  that  governs  the
building  design  and  construction.  The  contractor  is  responsible  for  compliance  and
may be subject to inspection from the authorizing governmental agency, may be sub-
ject to inspection by other third parties or may be allowed to self-certify compliance
with penalties assessed in the future if non-compliance is verified.

For private sector construction, building safety is ensured through a review of the
building plans and specifications for code compliance by the applicable State or local
agency,  inspection  of  the  building  for  code  compliance  during  construction,  a  final
occupancy  inspection  and  continued  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  selected  issues
during the life of the building.

Now, to the questions the Committee asked that I address.

Does  ICC  support  the  recommendations  of  the  NIST  study?  Why  or  why
not?

72

Events  such  as  the  structural  failure  of  the  World  Trade  Centers  shake  to  our
core our faith in the science, engineering, standards and means of ensuring building
safety that we use to protect our lives, our property and our economy. The ICC, from
the  beginning  of  this  investigation,  has  supported  the  work  of  NIST  in  examining
the collapse of the WTC and the development of recommendations for reform of our
nation’s  building  and  fire  codes  and  standards.  The  NIST  investigation,  even  as  it
was  in  process,  began  providing  the  building  industry  with  information  which  has
been  used  to  develop  and  implement  new  criteria  in  building  codes  and  standards.
Last  year,  as  the  membership  of  the  ICC  began  the  process  of  evaluating  code
change  proposals  for  publication  in  the  2006  edition  of  the  codes,  a  proposal  ema-
nating from early understandings of the collapse was put forward, thoroughly evalu-
ated, discussed and approved. The IBC now requires buildings of 420 feet and high-
er  to  be  constructed  with  structural  components  having  at  least  a  three-hour  fire
resistance rating; the previous requirement was a two-hour fire resistance rating for
structural  components.  These  increased  requirements  match  the  changing  condi-
tions  we  face  in  providing  for  building  and  fire  safety  and  address  the  public  will
to afford higher levels of security and protection. In making these changes it is also
important to protect the integrity of the public deliberation inherent in maintaining
the  democratic  development  of  voluntary  consensus.  We  have  begun  to  infuse  post-
WTC  concerns  into  the  code,  and,  as  I  will  speak  to  in  addressing  the  committee’s
other  questions,  the  ICC  has  acted  in  support  of  the  NIST  recommendations  by
empanelled  technical  committees  of  member-experts  to  prioritize  the  recommenda-
tions and form them into specific proposals that can be addressed by our code devel-
opment process. In addition, we are working with other groups, such as the National
Institute of Building Sciences in efforts to assess the WTC findings and to effectively
develop proposals for change to the code.

Also  in  support  of  the  recommendations  ICC  responded  to  NIST’s  request  for  re-
view  of  its  draft  report  earlier  with  extensive  comments  directed  at  assisting  NIST
with  the  clarity  of  its  discussion  and  findings.  The  majority  of  NIST  recommenda-
tions  on  the  subject  of  codes  and  standards  do  apply  to  the  IBC.  These  are  noted
below with a brief indication of how ICC gauges their potential applicability.

• NIST calls for more rigorous enforcement of codes. ICC believes a more appro-
priate  term  than  enforcement  is  compliance.  Enforcement  is  a  means  to
achieve  the  goal  of  safe  buildings,  something  embodied  in  compliance.  There
are  other  ways  to  secure  compliance  such  as  incentives  or  labeling  that  not
only ensures the goal is reached but can secure results above and beyond sim-
ple enforcement of minimum codes and standards.
• NIST calls for well trained and managed staff and educational programs. ICC
agrees and feels that NIST and other federal agencies can and should become
more  active  in  working  with  the  private  sector  to  develop  and  deploy  pro-
grams that would strengthen the resources that support code compliance.
• NIST suggests an increased focus in structural issues from a design, construc-
tion,  and  operations  and  maintenance  standpoint.  The  IBC,  and  referenced
standards  therein  such  as  those  from  ASCE,  provide  a  basis  for  measuring
and  expressing  structural  performance  and  ensuring  some  agreed  minimum
level of structural integrity in buildings.
• NIST  suggests  an  increased  focus  in  the  fire  resistance  of  structures  and
methods  to  evaluate  and  determine  their  performance  with  respect  to  fire.
The IBC, and referenced standards therein such as those from ASTM, provide
a  basis  for  measuring  and  expressing  building  performance  from  the  stand-
point  of  fire  resistance  and  ensuring  some  agreed  minimum  level  of  perform-
ance.
• NIST suggests increased consideration of performance based criteria as an al-
ternate to prescriptive criteria. The IBC addresses this in two ways. In estab-
lishing minimum prescriptive criteria the IBC establishes a basis to evaluate
alternative  approaches  to  performance  equivalency.  The  IBC  also  references
the ICC building performance code, a stand-alone code that is completely per-
formance-basis oriented. It is notable that NIST staff has been involved in the
development of this performance-based code.
• NIST  suggests  development  and  use  of  new  materials,  coatings,  barriers  and
other  technology.  The  IBC  addresses  this  by  allowing  acceptance  of  alter-
native  materials  and  methods  of  construction  when  they  are  certified  to  per-
form  at  least  as  well  as  items  specifically  allowed  in  the  IBC.  Equivalency  is
based on evaluation reports developed through engineering analysis prepared

73

by entities approved by the authority enforcing the code. As new certified ma-
terials become more commonplace standards are proposed and adopted to spe-
cifically address criteria for their application and use.
• NIST  recommends  improvements  in  active  fire  protection  systems.  The  IBC
and  referenced  standards  therein,  such  as  those  by  NFPA,  provides  a  basis
for review and incorporation of such improvements.
• NIST recommends improvements in building egress and evaluation. As I have
discussed,  the  IBC  provides  a  basis  for  review  and  incorporation  of  such  im-
provements.
• NIST  recommends  improvements  to  emergency  response,  building  access,
communications and central controls. The IBC provides a basis for review and
incorporation of such improvements.

On the basis of the WTC investigation NIST has made a number of recommenda-
tions  to  improve  building  safety.  The  IBC  provides  a  basis  to  address  and  take  ac-
tion  on  proposals  for  these  recommendations  and,  through  adoption  as  previously
noted, ensure their widespread implementation throughout the U.S. In this manner
the NIST work on the WTC report can have a significant impact on future building
design and construction.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  question  posed  by  the  committee  is  focused  on  the
IBC, which is used to guide new construction and significant renovations to existing
buildings. There is also a need to address the safety of the on-going use of our mas-
sive  base  of  existing  buildings.  Through  the  ICC,  safety  requirements  for  these
buildings  are  addressed  through  documents  such  as  the  ICC  International  Existing
Buildings  Code  (IEBC)  and  ICC  International  Fire  Code  (IFC).  Through  the  NFPA
these issues are addressed in the Life Safety Code and the National Fire Code. Ju-
risdictional  use  of  these  codes,  coupled  with  incentive  programs  to  foster  enhance-
ment to existing buildings, can address building safety where it may not be possible
to legislate renovation.
What specific steps will ICC be undertaking to determine whether and how
to incorporate the NIST recommendations into its codes? How long should
that process take? What will be the greatest barriers in the process?

Some  of  the  steps  associated  with  taking  action  on  the  NIST  recommendations,
as  I  have  discussed,  we  have  already  begun.  As  a  result  of  the  WTC  attacks  and
the  need  to  consider  code  changes  to  address  terrorism-related  issues  in  the  built
environment,  the  ICC  formed  an  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Terrorism  Resistant  Build-
ings.  The  committee—made  up  of  code  officials,  engineers,  architects  and  other
building professionals—is looking at the NIST recommendations as well as other re-
search  related  to  responding  to  new  threats  that  we  now  have  to  perpetually  ad-
dress.  In  addition,  at  the  annual  assembly  of  our  membership  last  month,  the  ICC
charged  our  permanent  Code  Technology  Committee  with  a  corresponding  assign-
ment  to  specifically  prioritize  the  NIST  recommendations  and  to  prepare  those  rec-
ommendations  as  proposals  for  the  deliberate  review  of  our  code  development  proc-
ess.  In  the  two  days  just  before  this  hearing  our  Code  Technology  Committee  has
been  meeting  with  the  National  Institute  for  Building  Sciences  to  coordinate  work
in developing and preparing proposals based on the NIST recommendations.

For  the  next  code  development  cycle  any  recommendations  to  revise  the  IBC  and
other ICC codes can be submitted by any party, including NIST staff or parties with
whom  NIST  participates,  on  or  before  March  24,  2006.  The  recommended  changes,
as discussed, need to provide specific language and citations to amend the code and
need to be accompanied by supporting documentation. It is our view that the infor-
mation gathered and analysis conducted by NIST on the WTC collapse would prove
instrumental in development of changes and supporting documentation.

As  to  the  standards  referenced  in  the  IBC,  NIST  would  have  to  take  similar  ac-
tion  with  each  standards  developer  based  on  individual  procedures  and  deadlines.
The timeframe associated with the next cycle of the ICC code development process
is  from  March  24,  2006,  at  which  time  proposed  changes  are  due  as  noted  above,
to October 4, 2007 with the completion of the final action hearing. The result of this
process will yield the 2007 supplements to the 2006 editions of each code. This proc-
ess  is  repeated  every  18  months,  resulting  in  a  new  edition  of  the  codes  each  three
years and a new supplement each interim.

More  details  on  this  process  are  covered  in  a  PowerPoint  presentation  presented
and  discussed  with  NIST  staff  earlier  this  year.  The  objective  of  ICC’s  initiative
with  NIST  staff,  in  advance  of  release  of  the  WTC  report,  was  to  advise  NIST  of
the  full  extent  of  the  public  process  or  code  amendment  so  that  NIST  could  begin
to develop a strategy for implementing the WTC report recommendations in parallel
to  completion  of  the  report.  In  this  way  it  was  hoped  NIST  could  develop  specific

codes  and  standards  proposals  prior  to  the  March  2006  deadline.  One  such  sugges-
tion  was  for  NIST  to  not  only  take  the  lead  in  development  of  proposed  changes  to
the  IBC  and  other  ICC  codes  but  also  to  parallel  that  activity  by  submitting  those
changes  to  federal  agencies  and  key  State  and  local  government  for  early  consider-
ation for action.

The  most  significant  barrier,  as  with  any  code  change  proposal,  is  having  tech-
nical  documentation  for  the  membership  to  review  in  consideration  of  specific  code
change  proposals,  and  the  advance  use  of  formal  and  informal  processes  of  discus-
sion and review to fully vet and analyze each proposal.
What specific actions should NIST be taking to help code organizations in-
corporate its recommendations? Are the recommendations framed in a way
that facilitates their adoption by code organizations or are they too general
or too specific?

NIST, as well as a number of other federal agencies, do already participate in the
code  development  process  through  submission  of  and  advocacy  for  code  changes.
This  participation  both  adds  to  the  quality  of  the  review  of  all  proposed  code
changes  and  helps  the  agencies  to  achieve  their  program  goals  as  directed  by  both
executive and legislative branches of government. For instance the U.S. Department
of  Energy  has  submitted  changes  to  the  IBC  in  the  past  to  more  fully  address  the
structural and fire resistance aspects of buildings associated with certain radiation-
related  processes.  This  will  specifically  help  address  DOE  interests  as  a  building
owner  as  well  as  the  general  public.  This  sort  of  federal  interagency  coordination
is precisely what is necessary for NIST to advance the recommendations of the WTC
report  through  ICC’s  code  development  process,  as  well  as  the  code  and  standards
development  of  other  providers  of  voluntary  consensus  standards.  Another  example
is participation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in realization that the
ICC  codes  are  effective  vehicles  to  achieve  CPSC’s  public  safety  goals  where  they
may not have otherwise have rule-making authority.

As  I’ve  discussed,  the  recommendations  are  not  written  in  a  way  that  facilitates
direct  adoption  and  do  need  to  be  reframed  in  a  manner  that  is  specific  to  the  de-
sired  result,  consistent  with  the  statutory  construction  of  the  ICC  codes,  and  pre-
sented in a manner that provides citation to each section and subsection of the code
that  is  directly  or  collaterally  impacted  by  the  proposal;  not  too  much  unlike  the
manner in which legislation this panel reviews must be framed to be consistent with
the  standing  body  of  our  U.S.  Code.  The  prospects  of  the  adoption  of  any  rec-
ommended  change  to  the  IBC  or  other  ICC  codes  cannot  be  addressed  without  see-
ing  the  details  of  the  particular  change.  The  nature  of  the  process  to  develop  codes
and standards within the voluntary sector, in allowing for participation by all inter-
ested  and  affected  parties,  ensures  full  due  consideration  with  respect  to  all  views
and variables.

In the simplest terms, the probability of a code change being accepted and eventu-
ally  incorporated  into  the  IBC  or  other  ICC  codes  and  maintained  in  federal,  State
and  local  adoption  of  those  codes  is  dependent  on  the  degree  to  which  the  existing
code  is  changed,  first  and  life  cycle  cost  impacts  associated  with  the  change,  avail-
ability  of  any  required  new  technology  and  support  infrastructure  for  that  tech-
nology,  impacts  on  various  trade,  labor  and  manufacturing  interests,  and  impacts
on the interests of advocacy groups, among other factors. In this manner the effects
on  the  process  are  quite  similar  to  what  the  legislative  or  executive  branches  go
through  in  considering  laws  or  regulations  that  impact  U.S.  industry,  public  inter-
ests, the economy and the environment.

The ICC has recommended to NIST that, as the degree of revision associated with
changes to the codes and standards increases, NIST should consider partnering with
interested and affected parties in the development of codes and standards proposals
as  opposed  to  taking  up  the  effort  alone  or  assuming  others  will  take  the  lead.  In
addition  ICC  has  also  stressed  to  NIST  that  without  their  involvement  and  leader-
ship  in  this  process  there  are  two  probably  outcomes;  either  nothing  will  be  done
to  implement  the  WTC  findings  codes  and  standards,  or  multiple  and  varied  inter-
ests  will  each  use  the  findings  to  their  own  advantage  resulting  in  multiple,  varied
and non-uniform codes and standards proposals that will be much more difficult and
time consuming to sort out, address and eventually agree upon.

With  that  said,  there  are  some  certainties  associated  with  the  process.  Changes
that  are  not  enforceable  or  require  specific  products  or  materials  by  name  are  not
likely  to  be  accepted,  nor  are  changes  that  reference  standards  that  have  not  been
fully completed.

As an association comprised building regulatory and construction industry profes-
sionals who come together to establish model codes for use by the public and private
sectors, the ICC is focused on building and fire safety. The ICC codes provide a plat-

form  and  foundation  for  achieving  improved  building  safety.  The  process  for  their
revision and enhancement is open to all and affords NIST and all others the oppor-
tunity  to  take  the  results  of  research,  investigations  and  studies  and  have  them,
through the wide adoption of the ICC codes, put into practice.

We  at  ICC  applaud  all  the  work  supported  by  Congress,  such  as  that  conducted
by NIST. We encourage continued support for such work by Congress and increasing
collaboration  by  the  public  and  private  sectors  in  enhancing  building  performance
and safety.

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today.  I  will  be  pleased
to  answer  any  questions  you  have  or  provide  additional  information  you  may  need.

BIOGRAPHY FOR HENRY L. GREEN

In  1989  Henry  L.  Green  was  appointed  Executive  Director  of  the  Bureau  of  Con-
struction  Codes  and  Fire  Safety.  Henry  has  worked  in  the  Bureau  for  more  than
twenty years serving as a building inspector, Chief of the Barrier Free Design Divi-
sion,  Chief  Building  Inspector  and  as  Deputy  Director  before  assuming  his  current
role.

As Executive Director, Henry provides management and oversight for construction
and  fire  safety  programs  in  the  state  of  Michigan.  These  program  responsibilities
include  the  development  and  implementation  of  construction  codes  and  standards,
fire  fighter  training,  building,  and  fire  inspection  programs,  public  fire  safety  edu-
cation, and the state fire marshal.

Additionally,  Henry  serves  as  Project  Director  for  the  Michigan  Timely  Applica-
tions  and  Permit  Service  (MiTAPS),  an  on-line  processing  system  for  permits  and
licenses  issued  by  the  State  of  Michigan,  and  serves  as  President  of  the  Inter-
national Code Council Board of Directors, an organization of which he is a founding
member.

Henry has also served on the Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA)
Board  of  Directors  for  ten  years,  serving  as  President  in  1997.  He  also  serves  as
a  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  National  Institute  of  Building  Sciences,
recently completing a term as Chairman of the Board of Directors in 2004.

Over  the  years,  Henry  has  been  recognized  nationally  and  internationally  as  a
proponent  for  developing  and  implementing  building  and  fire  safety  initiatives  and
codes.  In  1990,  the  Automatic  Fire  Alarm  Association  (AFFA)  named  Henry  ‘‘Man
of  the  Year’’  for  his  contributions  to  life  safety  as  Chairman  of  the  BOCA  Ad  Hoc
Committee for Fire Protection. AFFA acknowledged, ‘‘under his fine leadership, the
committee  developed  numerous  code  changes  to  the  BOCA  National  Building  and
Fire Prevention Codes. . .and significantly improved life safety in both new and ex-
isting construction.’’

In  1998,  Henry  received  the  ‘‘Distinguished  Service  to  Government’’  award  from
the  Building  Industry  Association  of  Southeastern  Michigan  and  was  awarded  the
Walker  S.  Lee  Award  in  recognition  of  outstanding  service  to  BOCA  International
in 1999.

In  addition  to  serving  the  state  of  Michigan,  Henry  has  participated  in  national
and  international  code  forums  representing  building  code  officials  at  World  Organi-
zation of Building Officials conferences in Hong Kong and Australia.

A life-long resident of Lansing, Michigan, Henry serves as a member of the Trust-
ee  Ministry  and  Building  Construction  Committee  at  his  church,  Union  Missionary
Baptist Church. He is a former President of the Woodcreek Parent Teacher Associa-
tion and served on the Waverly High School Parents Advisory Committee.

He,  and  his  wife  Angela,  are  the  parents  of  two  grown  sons,  William  and  Jason.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Green.  As  all
of you have observed, we have been rudely interrupted by a call of
the  House.  The  Speaker  doesn’t  check  first  with  the  Science  Com-
mittee  to  see  how  we  are  doing  in  our  proceedings  before  deter-
mining whether or not we are going to be voting. So, we are going
to have to take a recess for about 20 minutes, while we answer the
call  of  the  House.  It  is  my  understanding  that  there  will  be  two
votes,  and  on  this  vote,  there  are  exactly  six  minutes  and  41  sec-
onds left for us to get over to the Capitol.

I  will  just  leave  you  with  a  couple  of  thoughts  before  we  come
back  and  begin  the  questioning  in  earnest.  I  think,  Mr.  Corbett,
you asked the most profound question of the moment. Where do we
go  from  here?  And  that  is  our  determined  effort,  to  determine
where  we  go  from  here,  and  how  we  get  there.  I  would  point  out
that Dr. Jeffrey didn’t direct the study or conceive it. He inherited
it,  and  he  is  the  new  guy  on  the  block,  and  we  have  got  to  deal
with that fact of life.

Secondly,  I  would  point  out  that  if  you  look  at  the  report,  some
observers  might  say  it  is  bold  and  comprehensive.  Others  might
charge  that  it  is  vague.  I  think  it  is  a  little  bit  of  both,  and  where
it  is  bold  and  comprehensive,  we  have  to  seize  upon  the  direction
and  guidance  given  us.  Where  it  is  vague,  we  have  to  flesh  out
some  of  the  details,  and  get  a  little  more  specificity.  And  that  is
what  we  are  going  to  direct  our  questioning  to,  as  we  return  from
this rude interruption.

And I will let the Speaker know that you all share my view that
he rudely interrupted this proceeding. With that, let us adjourn for
20 minutes.
[Recess.]
Chairman BOEHLERT. We will start again. Members will be drift-
ing  back  from  the  floor  activity.  Understandably,  our  focus  will  be
on  the  report,  and  particularly,  Dr.  Jeffrey,  your  commentary  will
be welcome. Doctor, several of the witnesses have implied, and Mr.
Green and Mr. Corbett have stated quite explicitly, that NIST rec-
ommendations  are  not  presented  in  a  specific  enough  form  to  fully
inform  the  code  writing  process.  This  is  obviously  a  very  serious
matter, and we recognize that. I am sure you do, too.

Let  me  ask  you  a  series  of  questions,  and  then,  I  will  shut  up
and  listen  to  your  response.  Why  did  NIST  choose  to  present  its
recommendations in this fashion, and why have you only now con-
tacted NIBS, the National Institute of Building Sciences, and when
will  NIBS’  document  be  completed,  and  to  what  extent  will  NIST
review  the  document,  and  finally,  and  very  importantly,  will  NIST
be making specific recommendations to the ICC prior to March, be-
cause  if  they  don’t  come  prior  to  March,  well,  that  just  adds  more
time to the whole process?

So,  I  know  it  is  a  tall  order.  I  have  asked  those  questions,  and
I  see  you  furiously  taking  notes.  And  let  me,  once  again,  acknowl-
edge the fact that I recognize that you didn’t direct this study. You
inherited it. But you are the guy on the block now, and you are the
point  man,  and  we  have  a  high  regard  for  you,  and  we  want  to
work cooperatively with you, but we want to do as much as we can
to eliminate vagueness and concentrate on specificity.

The floor is yours.
Mr. JEFFREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  did  inherit  this,  but  I  am  very  proud  of  what  I  inherited.  I
think  the  NIST  team,  and  working  with  the  outside  experts,  have
done a phenomenal job on this.

In  terms  of  the  first  question,  why  were  they  couched  in  this
fashion,  this  level  of  specificity?  The  actual  detailed  recommenda-
tions  are  in  the  end  of  the  summary  report,  Chapter  9,  and  so  I
hope everybody takes a look at that. That is where there is a little
bit more detail on them. But the real trade-off is we aimed for per-

formance-based. As I am fairly new to the codes and standard set-
ting organizations, I have learned to appreciate the process as they
go  forward.  And  this  is  very  much  of  a  give  and  take.  It  is  a  con-
sensus-building. It is a very open, consensus-built process, and the
point is to try to put forward the guidance as to what needs to get
done. And I believe that the NIST recommendations do a very, very
good job of defining the what in terms of the recommendations.

The  specifics  of  the  how  is  where  you  now  need  to  do  the  trade-
offs between different organizations, different vested interests, and
the  whole  process  of  how  the  standard  setting  organizations  and
the  code  model  organizations  define  this  is  this  give  and  take  be-
tween  the  different  vested  interests  from  the  builders,  developers,
engineers, public safety——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  am  going  to  interrupt  you  here,  and——
Mr. JEFFREY. Sure.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  But  just  let  me,  I  mean,  do  you  disagree
with  what  Mr.  Green  said,  specifically,  the  recommendations  are
not  written  in  a  way  that  facilitates  direct  adoption.  And  how  can
you have give and take on vagueness?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  I  believe  that  the  recommendations  are  specific  in
terms of the performance, but we now need to go through this con-
sensus  process  of  turning  those  into  the  specific  language  that  the
code  developers  can  use  in  their  national  model  codes.  And  this  is
that step of, now, using the National Institute of Building Sciences,
and  working  with  these  organizations  to  address  those  very  con-
cerns. That is the next step, and we are working with them. In the
process  of  being  very  open,  I  was  very  pleased  to  hear  several  of
the  witnesses  talk  about  actually  starting  this  process  during  the
investigation  itself,  as  some  of  the  recommendations  started  to  be-
come apparent.

And  so,  I  think  that  it  is  at  the  appropriate  level  of  detail  now,
as  I  believe  Mr.  Green  also  stated,  that  if  we  over-specified  them,
they  would  also  have  a  higher  risk  of  rejection.  So,  it  is  that  deli-
cate balance of trying to do the consensus. In terms of the timeline,
we  are  very  much  committed  to  meeting  the  requirements  as  ap-
propriate.  For  example,  right  now,  what  we  are  going  through  is
all of the recommendations, with NIBS and with others, to identify
those  codes  where  we  can  get  the  language  in  place  to  meet  the
March 2006 deadline.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So,  you  are  personally  committed  to  that

March deadline.

Mr.  JEFFREY.  Absolutely.  Some  of  the  recommendations,  as  has
been  pointed  out  in  the  documents  and  by  some  of  the  witnesses,
require  more  work  in  terms  of  some  of  the  research  and  develop-
ment,  and  so,  what  we  are  trying  to  do  is  separate  those  with
NIBS, to identify those that can go forward very quickly, those that
require a little bit more detail, in terms of the research.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  So,  when  is  NIBS  going  to  be  ready,  and
you are going to have their report, you are going to evaluate? What
is the timeline there?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  It  is  going  to  be  actually  more  of  an  ongoing  proc-
ess  where  we  would  expect  that  as  a  lot  of  the  language  becomes
available,  they  are  going  to  be  submitting  these.  As  I  said,  there
is  going  to  be  a  set  by  March  2006.  I  will  actually  defer  to  the  ex-

pert  here,  Shyam  Sunder,  who  ran  the  investigation,  and  is  run-
ning the NIBS contract, on is there a specific final deliverable and
a date. I am not trying to put you on the spot, Shyam.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  come  on  up  and  identify  yourself  for

the purposes of the record.

Mr.  SUNDER.  I  am  Shyam  Sunder.  I  am  Deputy  Director  of  the
Building  and  Fire  Research  Laboratory,  and  lead  investigator  of
the——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  We  will  provide  seats,  if  you  would  like  to

have a seat. You know, we don’t want you——

Mr. JEFFREY. You are more generous than I am, so——
Mr. SUNDER. Thank you.
There are—we will prioritize the recommendations, so that those
that  are  ready  for  the  March  deadline  will  go  to  the  March  dead-
line,  and  those  that  are  ready  for  the  next  three  year  cycle,  which
would  be  a  deadline  six  to  eighteen  months  after  that,  we  would
go for that. But the people on our committee, the NIBS committee,
do  represent  the  organizations  around  this  table.  So,  we  have  offi-
cial representatives from those organizations.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  All  right.  Let  me  ask  some  of  the  other
witnesses.  Mr.  Green,  Mr.  Corbett,  let  us  go  down  the  line.  What
is your reaction to what he said? Is that good enough?

Mr.  GREEN.  Well,  we  are  committed  to  working  with  them  and
NIST  to  make  sure  that  they  have  in  line  for  March  code  changes
that  are  appropriate,  to  the  degree  that  we  can  get  through  after
we  prioritize.  I  think  that  once  that  is  accomplished,  getting  it  in
the  context  of  submission  for  code  language  is  somewhat  easy,  be-
cause  we  will  have  the  experts  working  with  them  at  NIBS  to  put
it in that context. That is what we need to do.

The  language  that  is  used  in  the  report  is  not  here  is  how  you
would put it in the code body, and that is why we have the people
sitting at the people with them. So, I am confident that we can get
through  this  process,  albeit  we  may  not  get  through  all  of  the  rec-
ommendations,  but  those  that  we  can  get  through,  we  will  have
them ready for March.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Corbett, what do you say?
Mr.  CORBETT.  I  am  glad  to  hear  that  they  are  committed  to
March. I think everyone recognizes that the code development proc-
ess is a long one to begin with, and if we could have truncated this
somehow,  and  got  that  process  of  recommendation,  preparation,
started  during  the  investigation  itself.  Because  some  of  these,  I
think,  are  kind  of  no-brainers.  I  mean,  there  are  things  that  we
could have been doing perhaps a year and a half ago.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Yeah, but as you said so eloquently, where

do we go from here? So, we can’t re-create what——

Mr. CORBETT. Right, right.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—is already——
Mr. CORBETT. Well, I think——
Chairman BOEHLERT.—behind us.
Mr. CORBETT. I think, you know, from my perspective, if they are
committed  to  a  March  timetable,  I  mean,  that  is  a  pretty  quick
turnaround, I would think. I mean, from my perspective. As far as
having so many people involved here. I mean, NIBS is bringing 15
or 20 people into this process here, so——

Chairman BOEHLERT. But—let me ask you—and I will get to Dr.

79

Harris and Ms. McNabb.

Mr. CORBETT. Yeah.
Chairman BOEHLERT. My red light is on, so I will go to Mr. Mil-
ler in a second, but are you comforted by what Dr. Jeffrey is saying
in  his  testimony  now,  in  his  response  to  these  questions?  Do  you
feel that we are on-course and we are going to be timely with spe-
cific  recommendations,  and  there  is  enough  time  before  March  to
have  that  so-called  give  and  take  he  is  referring  to,  and  that  we
are going to produce something worthy of note?

Mr. CORBETT. Yeah. As I said, I think I had hoped that it would
have been a lot sooner, but I mean, this is a commitment they have
made,  and  I  appreciate  that.  I  think  it  is  telling,  also,  that  the
NFPA  and  ICC  both  have  made  changes  years  ago,  on  some  of
these  things  we  are  talking  about  today.  I  mean,  the  fact  is  that
this  investigation  has  gone  beyond  what  even  the  code  groups
themselves  have  done  on  their  own.  So,  I  think  that  is—we  have
got to shorten this process for the future.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Dr.  Harris  or  Ms.  McNabb,  do  you  have

any comment? Microphone.

Mr. HARRIS. Sorry. I am comforted by what Dr. Jeffrey says, and
if you recall, the last thing I said was, this process is going to take
a  long  time.  And  let  me  tell  you  why  I  said  that.  In  February  of
1970  or  ’71,  there  was  a  significant  earthquake  in  the  San  Fer-
nando  Valley  of  Southern  California,  and  it  demonstrated  that
buildings  built  according  to  the  then  most  current  building  codes
and  standards  would  not  perform  well  in  what  could  only  be  con-
sidered a moderate earthquake at the time. That got the attention
of  several  federal  agencies.  They  commissioned  some  studies  to  es-
sentially  realize  that  finding,  and  make  recommendations  that
building codes and standards needed to be brought up to the state
of  knowledge,  if  you  will,  that  existed  in  the  research  community.
That process took about a quarter of a century.

The knowledge base wasn’t intended to be expanded, per se, just
get  that  knowledge  base  into  mandatory  requirements  and  codes
and  standards.  It  happened  in  several  stages.  There  were  things
that  did  occur  within  three  years  of  that  event  in  interim  updates
to  some  building  codes.  About  six  years  later,  there  was  an  act  of
Congress  that  was  passed,  the  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduction  Pro-
gram. That took some time. Even following that, there was another
major  milestone  in  about  1988  in  the  building  codes,  and  another
one  in  1997.  It  takes  a  long  time  to  incorporate  some  of  these
changes.  Now,  some  of  the  ones  are  very  narrow  scope  detailed,
and I think you may see action on them beginning in March. That
is fine.

Some  of  them,  like  the  one  I  happen  to  be  the  most  concerned
with,  number  one,  increasing  the  structural  integrity  in  buildings,
and  providing  resistance  to  progressive  collapse.  That  is  not  an
easy nut to crack. In fact, there, we probably even need more basic
knowledge. And so, it is going to take a long time before everything
that  NIST  has  uncovered  and  recommended  is  addressed,  and  it
will not all happen in one fell swoop.

Ms. MCNABB. Yes. NFPA has already made a number of changes
to  our  codes  and  standards,  as  a  result  of  the  NIST  investigation.
We  don’t  really  need  the  NIBS  process,  because  our  process  is  a
consensus  one.  We  bring  together  all  the  stakeholders  in  our  proc-
ess,  so  it  is  not  just  the  enforcers  who  are  making  the  final  deci-
sion.  It  is,  you  know,  the  users  of  the  buildings,  the  laborers,  the
insurers,  the  design  professionals.  We  have  nine  categories  of
stakeholders that participate in our process. We have the technical
expertise.

And  after  the  NIST  investigation  began,  we  set  up  a  High  Rise
Safety  Advisory  Committee  to  look  at  high  rise  safety,  and  to  be
ready  for  the  NIST  report,  because  we  recognized  that  it  is  really
society’s role to take the recommendations, the science, and set the
thresholds,  and  determine  which  buildings  should  these  rec-
ommendations apply to, and to weigh that and balance the risk and
the safety as it is.

Were  we  frustrated  that  the  recommendations  were  not  more
specific?  In  some  cases,  yes,  because  the  other  investigation  that
we were familiar with was the Station Nightclub investigation, and
that investigation done by NIST was much more specific than that
World Trade Center investigation. So, we feel that they could have
been  more  specific  in  some  cases,  but  again,  you  know,  just  by  its
very  nature,  the  investigation,  the  largest  building  failure  inves-
tigation, I think, is going to come up with some science that needs
to be studied and thought about, and all the viewpoints need to be
brought in. And that is what we are doing.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  it  is  good  to  know  that  we  are  mov-
ing  forward  on  several  fronts,  but  we  are  impatient,  understand-
ably.  A  lot  of  people  are  impatient,  understandably,  and  a  lot  of
people  want  action  as  quickly  as  possible.  And  I  am  reminded  of
another issue, acid rain, which is one of my pet concerns, and peo-
ple  kept  calling  for  more  studies,  more  studies,  more  conversation,
more  give  and  take.  And  I  remember  Governor  Kean,  at  the  time,
who ironically headed the 9/11 Commission, Governor Kean saying
if  all  we  do  is  continue  to  study  the  problem,  we  will  end  up  with
the best documented environmental disaster in history.

So, I think we are all very anxious to get going with some degree
of  specificity,  with  something  that  is  tangible,  that  we  can  get  a
hold  of,  and  we  appreciate  the  fact  that  some  of  these  things  are
going  to  be  time-consuming,  but  time  is  a  wasting.  With  that,  Mr.
Miller.

Mr. MILLER. Thank you.
I understand that building codes are designed to be a balance be-
tween  risk  and  cost.  If  something  is  a  serious  risk,  we  will  expect
people  to  pay  money  to  provide  against  that  risk,  to  incur  expense
to provide against that risk. But if something is a real remote pos-
sibility, we will be less inclined to do that.

Dr. Jeffrey, I was struck by your testimony and by Ms. McNabb’s
about  whether  NIST  recommendations  for  building  codes  should
apply to every building, every commercial building the same. Most
of  the  discussions  about  our  terrorism  risk  have  assumed  that
there is some possibility that there would be truly a random attack
on  any  garden  variety  commercial  building  in  America,  but  the
most  likely  targets  are  what  homeland  security  has  called  iconic

buildings,  buildings  of  high  symbolic  value.  The  World  Trade  Cen-
ter. The Pentagon, obviously both of those. The John Hancock Cen-
ter.  The  Empire  State  Building.  Dr.  Jeffrey,  I  have  practiced  law
for  a  while,  in  a  garden  variety  six  story  office  building  in  the
North  Hills  area  of  Raleigh  called  the  Landmark  Center.  It  was
Class B space. That was fine. I had kind of a Class B law practice.
Why on Earth would you expect the Landmark Center on Six Forks
Road in Raleigh to have the same standards of preparation against
terrorist attack that the John Hancock Center would have?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Miller.  Actually,  the  actual  build-
ing  codes  that  get  adopted  are  at  the  State  and  local  level.  First,
you know, that is part of the political process within the State and
local  governments  as  to  what  is  appropriate  for  that  specific  set-
ting.

Secondly,  in  the  report,  NIST  does  recommend  that  the  owners
of  the  iconic  buildings,  much  like  the  ones  you  have  mentioned,
may  want  to  view  a  higher  level  of  preparedness  than  the  aver-
age—the  report  specifically  does  not  try  to  recommend  that  every
building  in  the  Nation  be  able  to  survive  an  attack  with  a  fully
loaded  747.  And  so,  it  does  try  to  make  that  distinction,  and  calls
out the iconic buildings separately.

Mr. MILLER. Should that be something dealt with by—that sliver
of commercial properties, that are the most likely terrorism targets,
should  those  be  dealt  with  by  Congress,  rather  than  leaving  that
to local building codes?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  I  am  not  sure  that  I  am  actually  qualified  to  re-
spond to where the State and local versus federal roles should plan.
Mr.  MILLER.  All  right.  Well,  Ms.  McNabb,  what  is  your  thought
on this? Do you think that the Landmark Center ought to have es-
sentially  the  same  standards  applied  to  it  that  apply  to  the  John
Hancock Center?

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Let  me  interrupt  here.  Now,  I  won’t  take
this  from  your  time,  but  you  know,  this  is  not  just  about  terrorist
attack.  It  is  about  wind,  it  is  about  fire,  it  is  about  a  whole  bunch
of  other  things  that  may  not  involve  any  terrorist  activity,  but  we
know  we  don’t  know  enough,  and  I  am  not  quite  certain  we  know
what  we  don’t  know,  but  we  know  we  don’t  know  a  hell  of  a  lot,
and with that, Dr. Jeffrey——

Mr. MILLER. Mr. Chairman, could you diagram that sentence for

me? Ms. McNabb. Dr. Jeffrey, did you want to respond now?

Mr. JEFFREY. No, I will wait.
Mr. MILLER. Okay. Ms. McNabb.
Ms. MCNABB. I don’t think you can make a building terror-proof,
and  I  don’t  think  that  you  can  have  a  code  that,  you  know,  sets
forth  terror-proof  regulations,  because  by  definition,  terror  is  find-
ing  out  what  people  have  planned  for,  and  then  doing  something
above  and  beyond  that  to  scare  them  or  hurt  them.  So,  I  don’t
think  that  that  is  reasonable.  I  do  think  that  there—that  after  9/
11, we see that it is important to set the threshold for some build-
ings  differently.  And  even,  I  will  say,  high  rise  construction  has
progressed  so  much  that,  you  know,  what  we  used  to  think  of  as
a  high  rise  now  is,  has  gone  very,  very  high.  And  so,  maybe  it  is
time to think about different thresholds for tall buildings.

82

That,  I  think,  is  part  of  what  we  want  to  do  when  we  bring  all
of  the  players.  Perhaps,  it  is  not  just  a  threshold  for  how  high  the
building  it  is  or  how  iconic  the  building  is,  but  where  it  is  located
in  terms  of  the  urban  fabric,  that  is,  that  surrounds  it.  So,  those
are all things that we need to take into consideration, and unfortu-
nately,  catastrophes  are  what  we  respond  to,  rather  than  common
sense.  I  mean,  we  could  be  moving  forward  on  this  on  a  regular
basis,  but  people’s  attention  isn’t  on  it  regularly,  even  though  the
science  progresses,  and  we  learn  more  about  how  to  provide  ele-
vators  for  tall  buildings,  and  we  learn  more  about  different  tech-
nologies that can help us construct buildings. We don’t move along
on the safety as quickly, I think.

Mr. MILLER. Okay. It is striking to me that there does not appear
to  be  a  sense  of  urgency  in  the  private  sector  about  agreeing  upon
a  standard  for  private  sector  preparedness,  of  what  is  expected  of
them. The 9/11 Commission devoted all of about a page and a quar-
ter to private sector preparedness, but essentially said it should be
the  law  of  civil  liability,  negligence,  and  insurance  considerations,
and  underwriting.  It  should  be  financial  incentives  that  moves
American  business  to  take  steps,  care,  that  are  appropriate  to  the
risks  they  face.  And  suggest  further  industry  standards,  which  it
seems NIST might very well be part of.

The  initial  estimate  of  the  insurance  loss  from  9/11  was  $40  bil-
lion. It turned out to be $32 billion. The difference was all liability
claims,  that  Congress’  compensation  for  victims  made  compensa-
tion  contingent  upon  waiving  liability  claims.  So,  everyone  except
the passengers on the airplanes, of their families, waived the liabil-
ity  claims,  because  those  were  very  uncertain  claims,  given  how
stunned  the  Nation  was  by  9/11  and  the  very  idea  that  we  should
have  anticipated  that  and  provided  against  it,  something  that
seemed  beyond  our  imagination.  It  won’t  be  beyond  our  imagina-
tion the next time.

I  would  think  American  business,  that  commercial  real  estate,
would  be  pushing  hard  for  an  industry  standard,  some  standard
that  makes  very  clear  what  should  be  expected  of  them,  not  just
so  they  can  do  the  right  thing,  and  so  that  they  will  not  go  to  bed
thinking that people died when people could have lived if they had
something different. But for the simple, pragmatic reason that they
will have a defense to a negligence claim to show that they met the
standard of care that was expected of them, that there was an hon-
est standard. But in this hearing, and in other discussions in other
committees, there seems to be no such urgency. Do any of you have
any,  do  you  sense  that  there  is  an  urgency,  and  if  not,  why  not?

Ms. McNabb.
Ms.  MCNABB.  We  have  a  standard,  NFPA  1600,  on  emergency
preparedness,  that  encourages  the  public  and  private  sector  to
come  together  and  ask  themselves  a  series  of  questions.  And  I
think  that  is  the  kind  of  thing  that  works,  because  you  and  your
facility,  if  it  is  located,  and  I  believe  it  is  being  used  in  New  York
City,  you  look  at  what  the  hazards  are  in  your  building,  what  the
population is, what the context is, and you answer a series of ques-
tions,  and  then  you  plan  for  those.  You  provide,  you  know,  your
employees  with  what  they  need,  the  information  they  need,  places
to  go  if  it  is  a  biochemical  event.  Places  to  go  if  it  is  fire,  if  it  is,

83

you  know,  and  if  follows  through  and  allows  them  to  plan  for  dif-
ferent kinds of emergencies. So, it is out there, and it is being used
and adopted.

Mr. MILLER. Mr. Corbett.
Mr. CORBETT. I will just add that I testified before the 9/11 Com-
mission  on  this  specific  issue,  and  I  think,  unfortunately,  they
missed  the  mark  as  far  as  the  other  piece  of  it.  We  have  talked—
she  just  mentioned  NFPA  1600,  which  deals  with  the  people  side
of preparedness for issues of terrorism, things like that. But what,
really,  they  missed  was  the  need  for  some  kind  of  document,  some
kind  of  ruler  to  measure  the  level  of  protection  provided  for  iconic
buildings,  with  specific  regard  to  terrorism,  because  the  code
groups  have  up  until  this  point  not  developed  anything,  and  I  ap-
plaud the ICC, because they actually did create a committee to ad-
dress  those  issues.  ASCE  has  a  committee  on  blast-resistant  de-
sign,  but  you  are  right.  There  has  been  no  rush  to  have  at  least,
again, not a requirement, but at least a set of guidelines or a ruler
that  you  can  measure  a  building  against  to  say  yes,  this  building
is  well  prepared  for  a  terrorist  attack,  versus  one  that  perhaps  is
not. Thank you.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  Dr.  Jeffrey,  does  NIST  have
any  estimates  of  the  costs  of  implementing  the  recommendations,
and  were  costs  a  factor  in  making  their  recommendations,  and  do
you  think  cost  should  be  a  factor  in  determining  whether  to  adopt
the recommendations?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  Thank  you.  Cost  was  not  a  factor  in  making  the
recommendations.  These  were,  again,  performance-based.  Part  of
the  process  of  having  all  of  the  different  groups  represented,  in-
cluding  the  building  operators,  the  engineers,  the  architects,  the
standard setting organizations, is for us not to specify that specific
solution, but for those trade-offs to be made, and to try to find the
best approach. And then, depending upon the situation, some of the
expenses  may  be  more  justified  than  others.  It  is  much  along  the
lines  of  the  sentence  that  was  trying  to  be  parsed.  There  has  got
to  be  a  risk-based  approach  to  this,  and  for  some  situations,  some
of  the  requirements  may  make  more  sense  than  others.  But  that
is part of what this next step is.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Ms.  Regenhard  made  some  recommenda-
tions  about  making  a  lot  of  the  information  more  available  to  the
public at large relating to the investigation.

One,  do  you  think  she  is  on  to  something,  and  two,  why  aren’t
more  of  the  deliberations  available  for  public  consumption,  and
three,  I  would  be  anxious  to  hear  what  the  other  witnesses  on  the
panel  would  say  about  if  she  thinks  that  recommendation  about
making publicly more information available?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  Thank  you.  We  are  actually  committed  to  make
publicly  available  as  much  of  the  evidence  from  the  investigation
as we can. A portion of the evidence we received from third parties
is  protected  under  nondisclosure  agreements,  and  we  are  actually
going  back  to  those  parties  to  try  to  figure  out  exactly  how  much
of that we can release legally.

In  addition,  a  lot  of  the  photographers  have  material  that  is
copyrighted, and so, we are working with them to try to make sure
that we have the proper, appropriate copyright protections in place,

84

as  that  data  gets  released.  And  also,  a  lot  of  the  interviews  that
were  taken,  we  are  going  through  all  of  that  information  to  redact
out  any  of  the  information  that  might  be  able  to  identify  the  indi-
vidual, to protect their personal privacy. But as we go through that
process,  we  are  going  to  be  releasing  a  vast  amount  of  that  data.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Let  me  ask  the  other  panel  members.
What do you think about that? I mean, should we have more infor-
mation publicly available for review and examination and comment
and response? Mr. Corbett.

Mr.  CORBETT.  Definitely.  The  answer  is  yes  to  that.  That  has
been one of my concerns on the advisory committee, is that for ex-
ample,  all  the  information  dealing  with  the  first  person  accounts,
the  interviews  that  NIST  had  conducted,  at  one  point,  there  was
discussion about destroying that information. No decision had been
made,  but  that  was  a  possibility  at  one  point,  and  I  think  now,
NIST has basically said at this point, it won’t be destroyed, but we
are  still  not  sure  how  it  is  going  to  be  disclosed.  And  I  think  for
the benefit of myself and other people that are, weren’t part of the
investigation,  that  we  are  kind  of  on  the  outside  looking  in.  This
is  critical  information  for  them  for  other  research  they  are  doing
also. But also, to verify the conclusions, the findings, and of course,
the recommendations that were, that come about. So, critically im-
portant  to  get  that  information,  as  much  of  it  that  can  be  given.
Unfortunately,  I  think  this  is  an  issue  with  the  Act  that  NIST
ended  up  in  a  position  of  having  to  sign  agreements  with  various
entities  to  not  disclose  this  information,  but  again,  this  is  diamet-
rically  opposed  to  that  whole  open  process  that  we  have  talked
about so many times here today, and also three years ago.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, you know, proprietary information, I
suppose  I  can  understand  that,  but  if  the  information  is  subpoe-
naed,  if  you  ask  for  information,  saying  ‘‘please  come  forward  and
give  us  all  the  information  you  have,’’  and  they  say,  ‘‘well,  we  will
sign  this  nondisclosure  agreement.’’  Why  would  anybody  sign  a
nondisclosure agreement unless there are instances, clearly, where
you can understand the need for that.

Mr.  CORBETT.  Totally  understandable,  and  I  think  this  is  a  crit-
ical,  critical  issue  that  you  have  brought  up,  because  this  was  cer-
tainly  an  issue  for  the  World  Trade  Center  investigation,  was  cer-
tainly  an  issue  for  the  Rhode  Island  Nightclub  investigation,  be-
cause the Rhode Island Nightclub investigation, in my opinion, was
effectively shut down because they had access to virtually informa-
tion  in  the  first  place,  the  witnesses  that  were  there  that  day,  be-
cause  the  Rhode  Island  Attorney  General  told  them  they  couldn’t
have  it,  and  NIST  really  from,  I  would  imagine  from  their  legal
staff,  decided  that  it  wasn’t  possible  for  them  to  have  open  hear-
ings, to solicit information, to issue subpoenas for that information,
and  that  is  critical.  It  is  critical  to  this  Act,  and  it  was  critical  to
what happened with these investigations, and——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  yeah.  There  is  always  a  balancing,

delicate balance in there——

Mr.  CORBETT.  There  is,  and  I  have  no  qualms  about  proprietary
information  and  personal  information.  That  is  not  at  issue  here.
But it affected, especially, that Rhode Island investigation, because
a  lot  of  the  accounts  that  are  recorded  in  the  investigation  report

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00088 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

85

are  from  the  Providence,  Rhode  Island  Journal,  the  newspaper.
They  are  newspaper  accounts.  So,  why  didn’t  we  have  access  to
people  that  actually  were  there,  like  the  Rhode  Island  Attorney
General,  and  I  think  that  these  whole  legal  clouds  that  have  been
over these investigations are particularly troubling.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Anybody  else  care  to  comment?  Ms.  Jack-

son Lee.

Ms. MCNABB. I think the more——
Chairman BOEHLERT. Or excuse me, Ms.——
Ms. MCNABB. I think the more sunshine on the process, the bet-
ter  it  is.  I  think  that  in  general,  in  America,  there  is  sort  of  a  dis-
connect between the science and the application of the science, and
knowing information, and then, knowing then what should be done
with that information.

In  Katrina,  for  example,  I  mean  the  last  NOAA  reports  that  we
had  when  they  were  talking  about  wind  speeds,  and  what  was
going to happen. It was hard to get people to understand the impli-
cations of the science, and they started saying things like dogs and
cats  will  be  living  together  and  it  is  going  to  shake  buildings.  The
more science that NIST can give us, and the more information that
we have, I think the better off it will be for the public, because they
will  understand  that  building  regulations  don’t  just  come  out  of  a
vacuum  and  from  the  building  police,  that  there  is  a  reason  for,
perhaps,  raising  the  cost  of  construction,  or  perhaps  making  some
trade-offs, or doing things differently.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  In  almost  all  cases,  more  information,
rather than less, is desirable if you are reviewing and serious about
making  recommendations  to  prevent  something  in  the  future  from
happening.

Did you want to add something?
Mr. JEFFREY. Just a short statement, that we are absolutely com-
mitted to that. We agree with that. I think the entire process that
we  have  tried  to  follow  has  been  as  open  as  possible,  as  described.
The  number  of  open  meetings,  the  number  of  comments  received.
And  we  are  committed  to  trying  to  release  as  much  of  the  data  as
we  legally  can,  and  so,  we  know,  we  approve  and  agree  with  the
statements.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Ms. Jackson Lee.
Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  I  have  been  on  this  committee  a  sufficient
number  of  years  to  remember  the  hearings  that  we  had  imme-
diately  after  9/11  to  discuss  a  number  of  elements,  including  the
question  of  the  building  safety  and  security,  but  also,  a  number  of
other  issues  dealing  with  interoperability  and  science,  that  could
have  been  affected,  particularly  in  the  area  dealing  with  fire  pro-
tection. So, I am gratified that we are now here for a hearing that
has to do with a report that has been rendered.

I am interested in the testimony of Ms. Regenhard. Are you able
to come to the table, or answer any questions? I would be delighted
to  have  you—let  me.  And  let  me  thank  you,  first  of  all,  for  your
testimony,  and  accept  my  tardiness  because  I  was  flying  in  on  a
late flight. But I thought this hearing was important enough for me
to  be  able  to  come  and  to  assess  the  testimony,  and  to  hear  from
you as well.

You  made,  I  think,  a  very  potent  point,  which  is  that  there  was
a  sensitivity  that  the  NIST  study  was  not  detailed  enough,  that  it
seemed  to  have  some  political  ramifications.  They  may  not  have
been  on  the  ground,  and  many  of  us  have  been  to  Ground  Zero.  I
serve  on  the  Homeland  Security  Committee,  as  many  of  the  Mem-
bers  of  this  Science  Committee  does,  and  we  have  a  very  visual
sense of the need.

Can  you  share  with  us  what  more  you  would  want,  would  have
wanted  NIST  to  do,  or  where  were  the  political  correctness  issues
that you think really didn’t do the appropriate, or did not give the
appropriate  response?,  particularly  as  you  have  faced  a  personal
loss  in  the  loss  of  your  son,  and  you  have  my  deepest  sympathy?

Ms. REGENHARD. Thank you very much.
First  of  all,  I  just  want  to  preface  my  comments  with  saying  I
often  introduce  myself  in  the  way  that  I  am  basically  just  a  little
mother  from  the  Bronx,  and  really,  that  is  what  I  am,  and  I  am
not a technical person. However, I do have, over the last four years,
you  know,  the  input  from  my  wonderful  technical  advisory  panel,
which  represents  some  excellent,  excellent  people  in  the  academic
fields,  and  certainly,  you  know,  in  structural  engineering,  fire  pro-
tection, architecture, and evacuation specialists.

So—but to get back to your question, you know, political correct-
ness.  I  have  seen,  and  the  other  families  of  the  victims  have  seen
the  aftermath  of  9/11  to  be  somewhat  definitely  flavored  by  polit-
ical  correctness  in  many,  many  ways,  in  so  many  ways.  But  cer-
tainly,  with  the  NIST  investigation,  I  mean,  I  understand  that  it
is  a  wonderful  organization  of  scientists,  and  scientists  are  not
trained to be like NYPD detectives. There is a professional and aca-
demic way that these kinds of organizations deal with one and with
other  entities.  And  you  have  other  professional  people  in  that  in-
vestigation  that  should  have  been  really  interrogated,  such  as  the
Port  Authority,  such  as  their  building  plans.  You  know,  the  Port
Authority never turned over their building plans until there was an
article  about  it  in  the  front  page  of  the  New  York  Times  con-
demning them, or not condemning them, but accusing them of real-
ly not coming forward. That is one of the examples. People like the
chief  structural  engineer  for  the  first  World  Trade  Center,  you
know, his work should have been investigated, because after all, he
was responsible for the design of that building, and the subsequent,
and  yet,  instead  of  that,  he  was  sort  of  dealt  with  in  a  friendly
basis,  and  he  was  actually  put  on  the  payroll  to  explain  his  plans
and all that.

So,  there  were  these  very,  you  know,  maybe  because  I  am  a
layperson,  I  can’t  understand  why  these  entities  that  should  have
been scrutinized and investigated were sort of taken in and became
part  of  the  investigation.  You  know,  that  is  just  one  of  the  exam-
ples  of  where  the  families  were  really,  really  deeply  concerned
about that. And also, the avoidance of certain things that were not
politically  correct,  like  the  avoidance  of  blaming  anyone  for  any-
thing. I mean, we all teach our children to obey the law, and to re-
spect authority, and not to break any laws, but yet, when we have
this investigation of the, I would say the needless deaths of nearly
3,000  people,  no  one  is  to  be  blamed.  It  is  handled  so  gingerly.  I
mean,  there  is  a  reason  why  nearly  3,000  people  are  dead,  and  I

feel the majority of them needlessly, but yet, the approach of these
investigations is very, very tentative, and no one wants to put any-
one on the line, and no one wants to look into what was the effect
of the Port Authority immunities from building and fire codes?

If someone said to me what are the two major grievous examples
of what went wrong on 9/11 in those buildings? I would say the two
things  are  the  Port  Authority  exemptions  and  immunities  from
New  York  City  building  and  fire  codes,  and  the  wholesale  failure
of  the  FDNY  radio  communications,  and  the  wholesale  failure  of
the  Emergency  Management  System  of  the  City  of  New  York  and
the  Port  Authority.  And  these  are  the  crux  of  the  matter.  This  is
the  bottom  line.  Yet,  these  are  the  issues  that  were,  you  know,
skirted around and, you know, tiptoeing through the tulips, instead
of—and  still,  today,  I  have  to  fault  both  the  9/11  Commission  and
the  NIST  investigation  for  not  taking  a  stand,  for  not  saying  that
in our country, no building should be above the law, especially the
Port Authority buildings that were the tallest and largest buildings
in  the  world,  that  at  that  time,  was  built  to  contain  the  largest
number  of  people  in  the  world,  and  yet,  those  buildings  were  al-
lowed  to  be  exempt  and  immune  from  building  and  fire  codes,  es-
sentially above the law, and now, we are allowing the Port Author-
ity to do the same thing all over again.

The new World Trade Center and the memorial, and every single
building  down  there  on  that  property  will  be  just  as  exempt  and
immune from every single New York City building and fire code as
the first one. That is an abomination. That is a sin. That is an out-
rage against humanity. And you know, I am sorry to get emotional.
I expected the NIST investigation and the 9/11 Commission to take
a  stand  on  that,  but  you  know  what,  it  is  only  the  average  Joe  Q.
Citizen. When we break the law, we have to pay the consequences,
but when we have these huge organizations breaking the law, I feel
they  are  not  held  to  the  same  standard  as  an  average  citizen,  and
that hurts.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. REGENHARD. Thank you. I am sorry. I am talking too much.

I am sorry.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you very much for giving us that testi-
mony.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  hope  that  in  the  course  of  this  re-
view, that Dr. Jeffrey of NIST and others who are representing the
fire protection community, Mr. Green, who has several ideas about
being  able  to  self-code  or  self-improve  your  buildings  against  wind
and  others,  the  Katrina  story  that  I  understand  that  you  shared
with  us,  can  respond  to  her  inquiry  about  building  codes  and  im-
munity. That seems to be an indictment of the report from the very
start,  and  I  hope  we  will  have  an  opportunity  to  review  that,  and
I  hope  Mr.  Jeffrey  will  have  an  opportunity  to  respond  to  that  in-
dictment.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you. The——
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Thank you.
Chairman BOEHLERT.—gentlelady’s time has expired.
I  would  report  that  we  anticipated,  in  developing  the  legislation
that  authorized  the  report  and  everything,  we  anticipated  that
there would be a reluctance on the part of some to provide informa-
tion.  There  would  be  inertia.  And  that  is  why  we  gave  subpoena

power  to  NIST,  to  go  in  and  get  the  information,  and  it  was  not
NIST’s  role  to  assign  blame.  It  is  NIST’s  role  to  investigate,  to  de-
termine what went wrong, to make recommendations on how to go
forward, and that is what we are determined to work cooperatively
with  Dr.  Jeffrey  and  the  NIST  people,  to  make  certain  it  happens
the  way  we  want  it  to  happen,  and  that  we  don’t  drag  our  feet,  or
we don’t issue a report, and sort of say gee, we did a great job. We
have  this  report,  and  have  it  not  as  specific  as  we  would  like,  or
there be a lack of follow through.

And  quite  frankly,  Congress  has  a  responsibility,  too.  We  have
got  to  conduct  more  meaningful  oversight  hearings.  It  is  all  well
and  good  for  Congress  to  pass  legislation,  and  then  put  out  our
press releases, and say boy, we passed this legislation dealing with
an important problem facing the people of the Nation we are privi-
leged  to  represent,  and  then  go  on  to  the  next  thing.  We  have  got
to pause now and then, and look back and say, is it working as in-
tended? How can we make sure it works more effectively?

And that is why we are having this hearing today. This isn’t the
first hearing or the second hearing, it is the third hearing, and we
are  going  to  have  more.  And  we  are  not  ignoring  Ms.  Regenhard
and  her  group.  They  are  very  valuable  resources  for  this  com-
mittee,  and  we  listen  to  them,  and  we  want  to  work  cooperatively
with them, but we want to work cooperatively with everybody.

So,  let  me  ask  you,  talking  about  our  responsibility,  Dr.  Jeffrey.
In  your  testimony,  you  haven’t  discussed  what  actions  should  be
taken by the Federal Government in response to your recommenda-
tions. It seems there are a number of steps, not only relating to the
General Services Administration, but to the agencies that run R&D
and  education  programs,  including  FEMA  and  NSF,  and  NIST
itself.  What  should  the  Federal  Government  be  doing?  Is  NIST
going  to  put  out  any  formal  document  on  this,  and  how  are  you
going to work with the other federal agencies on these matters?

Mr. JEFFREY. Thank you, sir.
There  are  a  number  of  actions  that  need  to  be  taken.  As  I  men-
tioned  earlier,  there  are  a  number  of  research  and  development
programs, for example, that are sure to come out in this report. In
fact,  the  report  actually  highlights  where  some  of  those  R&D  ef-
forts  are.  And  you  know,  a  lot  of  them  fall  under  NIST  to  try  to
execute.  We  have  made  a  plug  for  the  last—probably  the  last  cou-
ple of days I can make this plug, we have got a program in the FY
’06  President’s  budget  to  try  to  address  some  of  those  R&D  pro-
grams,  and  I  am  hoping  Congress  looks  kindly  on  that,  so  we  can
start to address some of those.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  No,  continue.  But  how  about  some  of  the

other agencies?

Mr. JEFFREY. On the other agencies, we need to get together. We
have  not  done  that  yet.  There  are  some  of  the  recommendations
that  involve,  especially  some  of  the  education  programs.  We  have
been  working  a  lot  with  the  private  sector  on  that.  We  need  to
bring  in  some  of  the  other  parts  of  the  Federal  Government  that
we have not yet done.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Because  you  know  what  happens.  You
know, you all march down the, you develop your budget, and then,
you  march  down  to  OMB,  and  say  this  is  what  we  want.  This  is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

89

what we can justify. Here is the documentation. And then, the cuts
start happening, particularly in the R&D area, and because that is
longer  range,  and  we  have  got  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  the  mo-
ment.

So, we are going to be helpful to you, with respect to NIST’s par-
ticular budget, and quite frankly, what an embarrassment the way
Congress treated you last round. This round, we are going to treat
you  better,  and  we  are  determined  to  see  that.  You  got  all  friends
here,  but  some  of  these  other  people,  we  have  got  to  convince,  or
don’t  even  know  what  the  hell  NIST  stands  for.  But  you  have  got
to  talk  to  some  of  the  other  agencies,  and  have  some  specific  rec-
ommendations  on  what  they  should  be  doing,  and  we  want  to  fol-
low through with you on that, to make sure we keep on their tails,
so to speak.

Mr. JEFFREY. Absolutely, and I would be very happy to follow up

with you and your staff on that.

Chairman BOEHLERT. All right. Now, I think it is fair to say that
NIST  is  making  some  pretty  far-reaching,  perhaps  even  revolu-
tionary  suggestions  here,  particularly  with  regard  to  full  building
evacuation.  All  of  you,  perhaps  understandably,  are  hedging  your
bets at best, in your testimony as to whether the recommendations
would  find  their  way  into  code.  Is  your  general  sense  that  NIST’s
approach  makes  sense?  Do  these  recommendations  have  applica-
bility beyond terrorism, to more—and I think they should and do—
to  more  routine  problems  encountered  in  the  field,  including  nat-
ural disasters?

Let  me  go  down  the  panel,  and  ask  who  wants  to  respond  first

to that? Dr. Harris.

Mr. HARRIS.—able to make these recommendations. The solution
to  the  terrorism  problem  is  not  to  really  make  buildings  stronger.
It  is  to  keep  airplanes  and  things  like  that  out  of  buildings.  This
event  has  created  a  tragic  misconception,  I  think,  in  the  minds  of
the  public,  that  buildings  actually  perform  better  than  typical
buildings  really  will  perform.  The  public  believes  that  when  a  big
airplane  flies  into  a  building,  what  happens  is  what  happened  at
the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon, that is, the plane dis-
appears  into  the  building,  and  there  is  a  hole.  Smoke  begins  to
come  out,  and  after  a  while,  some  portion,  or  maybe  all  of  the
building  collapses.  That  is  not  what  happens  when  you  fly  a  big
airplane into most buildings. What happens is——

Chairman BOEHLERT. They do know that the building was struc-
turally  sound.  It  was  the  insulation,  the  foam  that  was  blown  off,
and——

Mr.  HARRIS.  That  is  correct.  What  happens  with  most  buildings
is,  in  fact,  a  portion  or  maybe  all  of  the  building  collapses  imme-
diately. Their recommendation number one addresses that. But the
addressing  it  is  not  to  make  it  safe  for  an  airplane.  It  is  to  make
it  safe  for  a  satchel  bomb,  or  perhaps,  a  car  bomb  outside.  There
are completely different issues, all right.

But  that  is—the  real  value  of  the  study  is  we  do  need  to  think
about  that.  When  we  get  into  this  question  of  iconic  buildings,
there is not just going to be one dividing line, I do not believe. We
are going to have something for the next World Trade Center, cer-

tainly.  There  will  be  something  for  the  City  Hall  in  Denver,  Colo-
rado, for example. I had——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Well,  how  about  Mr.  Miller’s  six  story

building in Raleigh, because——

Mr. HARRIS. And Mr. Miller’s six story building probably will not
be affected by that recommendation, at least in my own opinion, it
probably would not. And that is not because I invest in real estate
or  construction.  It  is  just  I  don’t  think  it  will  be.  But  there  will  be
a  gradation,  and  that  is  what  is  going  to  take  time  to  come  to,  as
well  as,  on  that  particular  issue,  the  technical  substance  of  how
you  do  it  is  going  to  have  to  take  some  time,  too.  There  is  no  one
magic  recipe  there.  I  would  want  to  get  on  the  record  something
I had meant to say earlier, and commend the General Services Ad-
ministration for the leadership they have been taking on that issue
of  progressive  collapse,  with  the  construction  of  new  federal  court-
houses, where they are taking that issue very seriously.

And  I  would  like  to  make  one  other  comment,  while  I  have  the
mike.  And  that  is  I  saw  that  recommendation  number  25  actually
does respond to the issue raised by Ms. Regenhard of the Port Au-
thority  having  an  exemption.  It  is  an  important  recommendation
here  that  needs  to  be  carefully  considered.  There  are  all  sorts  of
legal ramifications about how you implement this, so it is not going
to come quickly, either. But I think the pressure of your bully pul-
pit,  and  Congress  in  general,  bringing  to  light  the  issue  of  various
entities  having  these  exemptions,  and  how  you  go  about  fulfilling
the  promise  that  I  am  trying  to  build  something  as  good  as  the
code  would  require.  How  do  you  go  about  that?  That  is  something
for, I think, all of us to focus. It is——

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Just  let  me  read  into  the  record.  It  won’t
take  me  long.  The  recommendation  number  25,  because  it  is  very
pertinent.  ‘‘Nongovernmental  and  quasi-governmental  entities  that
own  or  lease  buildings,  and  are  not  subject  to  building  and  fire
safety  code  requirements  of  any  governmental  jurisdiction  should
provide  a  level  of  safety  that  equals  or  exceeds  the  level  of  safety
that  would  be  provided  by  strict  compliance  with  the  code  require-
ments  of  the  appropriate  governmental  jurisdiction.  To  gain  broad
public confidence in the safety of such buildings, NIST further rec-
ommends  that  as  designed  and  as  built,  safety  be  certified  by  a
qualified third party, independent of the building owner or owners.
The  process  should  not  use  self-approval  for  code  enforcement  in
areas  including  interpretation  of  code  provisions,  design  approval,
product acceptance, certification of the final construction, and post-
occupancy inspections over the list of the buildings.’’ That is a pret-
ty good recommendation, I think.

Mr. Corbett, Mr. Green, do you want to comment on this?
Mr.  GREEN.  Well,  from  my  perspective,  I  think  that  we  should
encourage,  if  not  more  strongly  encourage,  states  to  establish
standards  for  buildings  in  their  areas  where  they  may  not  have
code enforcement.

Chairman BOEHLERT. But does this approach make sense to you?
Mr.  GREEN.  It  does  make  sense,  but  the  value  of  having  a  gov-
ernmental  entity  have  that  oversight,  I  think,  adds  value  to  the
safety  in  the  building.  I  am  not  so  sure  I  am  sold  on  this  third
party  element.  I  would  rather  see  that  the  third  party  would  be  a

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

91

governmental  entity  that  has  some  enforcement  responsibility,  to
assure that the building does comply. I don’t want to suggest before
this  committee  that  it  is  not  appropriate  to  have  third  party  in-
volvement,  but  you  are  assured  at  a  greater  level  when  you  have
governmental involvement for oversight to compliance.
Chairman BOEHLERT. What do you say, Mr. Corbett?
Mr.  CORBETT.  I  agree  totally.  I  might  also  make  a  couple  notes,
that the word governmental is missing from recommendation num-
ber  25.  The  Federal  Government,  State  government,  local  govern-
ment.  The  word  government  isn’t  in  there.  So,  that  is  a  whole
group  of  buildings  out  there  that  are  not,  obviously,  subject  as  we
stand  today,  with  local  and  State  regulations,  and  I  would  point
out,  it  is  ironic  that  you  mentioned  GSA  before,  because  I  know
GSA  actually  has  participated  in  the  code  development  process,
and  actually,  to  my  understanding,  was  stating  an  opposition  of
proposals  for  wider  stairs  in  high  rise  buildings.  So,  it  is  kind  of
ironic  that  on  one  hand,  you  know,  we  are  not—they  do  not  have
to comply with the code, but on the other hand, are able to partici-
pate in the process that affects other buildings. So——

Chairman BOEHLERT. Government has a way of doing that.
Mr.  CORBETT.  But  I  do,  I  agree  totally  with  Mr.  Green  that  my
own  opinion  that  I  would  have,  I  would  prefer  that  recommenda-
tion 25 not look for a third party, but look for that, again, that local
government  or  State  government,  whatever  it  is,  to  review  and  to
inspect  and  to  oversee  the  nongovernmental  and  quasi-govern-
mental entities.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  don’t  think  we  have  legal  authority.  But
government  is  in  the  habit  of  saying  don’t  do  as  I  do,  do  as  I  say.
Any  other  comment  on  that,  before  I  go  to  Dr.  Ehlers?  Ms.
McNabb, did you have something?

Ms.  MCNABB.  Yes.  In  terms  of  the  recommendation  25,  I  think
it is a good recommendation. We support it. In fact, the NFPA com-
ments  were  to  include  government,  but  understanding  that  that  is
a matter of Constitutional law, and perhaps, that is why NIST rec-
ommended  the  third  party,  is  that  is  an  easy  way  of  dealing  with
that issue, related to the Constitution.

In  terms  of  full  building  evacuation,  to  go  back  to  your  earlier
question,  I  think  that  it  is  inevitable  that  after  9/11,  even  though
it  is  not  required,  that  building  occupants  may  want  to  do  a  full
building  evacuation  or  drills  in  the  event  of  an  emergency.  NFPA
has  a  pamphlet  on  this,  but  we  think  that  it  should  be  looked  at,
because  full  building  evacuation  could  result  from  things  like  a
bomb  threat,  from  things  like  a  power  failure,  not  necessarily  ter-
rorism.  So,  it  is  something  that  I  think  needs  to  be  studied,  and
it is a good recommendation.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much. Dr. Ehlers.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  apologize  for  missing
much  of  the  hearing,  but  we  still  have  one  of  my  markups  going
on, and I will have to dash over there shortly.

On the issue of evacuation, I was amused in thinking about this
and  the  relationship  with  NIST,  but  when  I  spent  a  year  at  JILA
in Boulder, Colorado, as you know, there are a lot of mountaineers
in  that  area,  including  in  JILA.  I  went  into  one  of  my  colleague’s
offices  one  day,  and  he  is  up  on  the  ninth  floor  of  JILA,  and  saw

this 150-foot coil of rope there, and I said oh, going climbing later?
He  says  no,  no.  That  is  my  emergency  escape  route.  And  he  was
dead  serious.  If  anything  happened  down  below,  he  was  going  to
just rappel out the window, and go on down.

Dr.  Jeffrey,  I  have  a  question  for  you,  that  there  apparently  has
been  some  controversy  or  criticism  of  NIST  that  they  did  not  in-
voke  the  NCST,  and  did  not  send  their  NCST  team  down,  as  part
of  investigative  team,  to  the  Gulf  Coast  after  Hurricanes  Katrina
and  Rita,  but  instead,  used  your  standard  authority  for  that.  And
the  criticism  has  been  that  you  haven’t  exercised  your  leadership
role  in  the  federal  investigation  of  the  damage  to—hurricane-re-
lated  damage  to  the  buildings  in  that  area.  And  I  would  just  like
to  get  on  the  record  a  response  to  this.  Why  did  NIST  choose  not
to invoke the National Construction Safety Team Act when deploy-
ing  these  teams?  And  how  has  NIST  interacted  with  other  federal
agencies that are on the ground in the Gulf Coast states? And why
are you not leading the effort on building safety investigations?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  Thank  you,  sir.  The  authorities  that  NIST  has  to
do investigation are essentially the tools in our toolbox. And we are
going  to  use  the  best  tool,  the  most  appropriate  tool,  for  whatever
investigation  we  need  to  do.  And  for  the  Hurricane  Katrina  and
Gulf Coast areas, we have got authorities that are actually broader
than  the  NCST,  and  more  appropriate  for  the  kinds  of  investiga-
tions that we need to do.

For  example,  we  had  a  reconnaissance  team  go  down  there,  and
a  lot  of  the  things  that  were  identified,  in  terms  of  further  inves-
tigation, includes not just buildings, but includes other components
of the infrastructure, for example, water, and sewage plants. It in-
cludes  bridges,  tunnels,  et  cetera,  that  are  not  covered  under  the
NCST.  In  addition,  we  are  going  to  learn  a  lot  from  buildings  that
have not just failed, but buildings that were damaged, which again,
is not covered under the NCST. So, we are applying exactly the au-
thorities that we think we need to to try to get the job done.

In terms of leadership, from day one, we have been working with
FEMA as part of their emergency response, as part of the National
Response  Plan.  Within  the  first  week,  we  had  a  person  go  there,
a  roofing  expert  go  down  with  a  group  of  23  volunteers  to  Mobile,
Alabama,  to  look  at  roofing.  We  sent  out  a  team,  as  I  mentioned
just a second ago, in terms of reconnaissance, to try to look through
the  Gulf  region,  and  we  have  now  got  three  teams  that  are  under
NIST  coordination  that  are  made  up  of  16  different  private  and
government  organizations  of  experts,  that  are  going  around  the
Gulf region, doing detailed assessments now.

So,  we  believe  that  we  have  been  very  aggressive  in  the  teams
that  we  have  sent  down  there,  and  using  the  appropriate  authori-
ties to get as broad a view of the situation as possible.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you.  Does  anyone  else  wish  to  comment  on

that issue? Mr. Corbett.

Mr.  CORBETT.  Yes,  thank  you.  I  commented  on  this  during  my
testimony,  and  I  still  believe  the  NCST  would  have  been  useful
down  there,  especially  given  the  fact  that  the  problems  we  have
had with the World Trade Center investigation, you know, securing
evidence,  getting  evidence  early  on.  I  mean,  we  were  very  heavily
reliant  on  computer  models  to  tell  us  what  happened  to  the  Twin

Towers,  because  we  lacked  that  physical  evidence,  because  there
wasn’t an Act when the Trade Center was hit.

And I really believe that I would have preferred to have a much
more  aggressive  paratrooper  type  response  from  this,  with  recon-
naissance  teams  to  figure  out  what  are  the  buildings  we  have  got
to  study,  you  know.  The  Act,  I  believe,  does  include  provisions  for
investigating  building  disasters  that  had  the  potential  for  a  large
life  loss.  It  doesn’t  have  to  be,  my  understanding  that  it  has  to
have lives lost in the building. So, I just—I would have hoped that
we  could  have  done  under  the  Act.  I  understand  that  they  have
other  authorities  to  do  that  work,  but  I  had  always  hoped  that
NCST would skip to that same level as the NTSB, in terms of pub-
lic  recognition,  public  understanding  of  what,  you  know,  what  we
are looking for.

Mr. EHLERS. Dr. Jeffrey, let me just ask, couldn’t you have done
both?  Couldn’t  you  have  sent  down  an  NCST  team  to  investigate
those areas where they needed that type of authority, and used the
standard teams in other areas, where they needed their authority?
Mr. JEFFREY. They are the same people. I mean, we have got the
same  technical  experts,  and  it  is  actually  transparent.  As  long  as
they  have  the  authorities  to  do  the  job,  and  at  any  time  that  they
need  additional  authorities,  we  will  find  those  additional  authori-
ties within our legal limits, to provide them that. But it is the same
people. It is the same technical experts.

Mr. EHLERS. And did you at all invoke the authorities under the

NCST?

Mr.  JEFFREY.  Not  for  Hurricane  Katrina.  As  the  broad  scope  of
what  the  investigation  is  actually  fits  better  under  other  existing
NIST authorities.

Mr. EHLERS. But weren’t there some instances, as Mr. Corbett is
mentioning,  where  you  should  have  used  the  authority  of  the
NCST?

Mr. JEFFREY. The authorities that we have got would cover a lot
of  the  situations.  The  unique  authority  that  the  NCST  would  pro-
vide us is essentially the ability to legally require a release of docu-
mentation.  We  have  not  reached  a  situation  where  that  has  been
an issue for the Hurricane Katrina situation.

If,  at  some  point,  we  need  subpoena  authority,  and  it  fits  under
the  legal  guidelines  of  the  NCST,  we  will,  without  hesitation,  use
that authority.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  ex-
pired.  I  thank  all  of  you  for  being  resources  for  this  committee.  I
will end, Mr. Corbett, by answering your question. Where do we go
from  here?  We  are  going  to—eternal  vigilance.  We  are  going  to
keep  on  top  of  this.  We  developed  the  whole  legislation  to  make
possible this investigation. We are going to keep on it.

Dr. Jeffrey, we fully expect you and your team at NIST, we com-
pliment  you  for  all  the  good  work  you  have  done.  You  have  got  a
lot more to do, and we want to follow very closely your interaction
with  NIBS,  and  we  want  to  make  sure  you  get  recommendations
with  specificity  to  the  ICC  before  March.  There  are  a  lot  of  things
we want to make sure of, and so, this is not the end of the process.
We  are  somewhere  in  the  middle  of  the  process.  We  are  going  to
go forward.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  William  Jeffrey,  Director,  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Tech-

nology (NIST)

Questions submitted by the Majority
Q1. In your testimony you described how a staff member at NIST had been assigned
to  each  of  NIST’s  recommendations  to  ensure  that  they  are  carried  out.  Please
provide  the  Committee  with  a  list  of  the  recommendations  that  call  for  an  ex-
plicit  code  or  standard  change,  a  brief  description  of  the  steps  in  the  process  of
changing these codes and standards, where NIST is in this process, and the code
and standards groups with whom NIST is working on each recommendation.

A1. Please  see  attachment  A  which  identifies  the  affected  codes  and  standards  by
each  of  the  WTC  recommendations.  NIST  is  currently  pursuing  action  on  each  of
the WTC recommendations with an emphasis on meeting the March 24 deadline for
the International Building Code.
Q2. In her testimony, Ms. McNabb said that the recommendation related to elevators
may  be  one  of  the  most  important.  Do  you  agree?  How  difficult  would  that  be
to  codify  and  implement?  Can  you  give  the  Committee  a  sense  of  what  specific
next steps you would take to evaluate that recommendation and what additional
information you would need and from whom?

A2. NIST  agrees  that  improved  building  evacuation  overall  should  be  a  priority.
Buildings  should  be  improved  to  include  system  designs  that  facilitate  safe  and
rapid  egress,  methods  for  ensuring  clear  and  timely  emergency  communications  to
occupants, better occupant preparedness for evacuation during emergencies, and in-
corporation of appropriate egress technologies. Recommendations 16, 17, 18, 19, and
21 address these. The use of occupant evacuation and fire service elevators in emer-
gencies  is  a  key  element  of  these  recommendations.  Further,  Recommendation  20
recommends  that  the  full  range  of  current  and  next  generation  evacuation  tech-
nologies  should  be  evaluated  for  future  use,  including  protected/hardened  elevators,
exterior  escape  devices,  and  stairwell  descent  devices,  which  may  allow  all  occu-
pants an equal opportunity for evacuation and facilitate emergency response access.
As  part  of  the  implementation  process  for  the  WTC  report  recommendations,  the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers is addressing the use of elevators for oc-
cupant evacuation and fire service use.
Q3. How  many  people  does  NIST  have  working  on  WTC  investigation-related
projects  now  that  the  main  part  of  the  investigation  is  wrapping  up?  Will  the
Hurricane Katrina investigation take resources away from WTC follow-up?

A3. NIST  has  over  20  members  of  its  staff  continuing  to  work  on  WTC  investiga-
tion-related  projects  as  part  of  its  overall  WTC  response  plan,  which  includes  a  re-
search and development program and a dissemination and technical assistance pro-
gram.  A  key  part  of  this  effort  is  promoting  implementation  of  the  WTC  rec-
ommendations.  NIST  staff  continue  to  work  vigorously  with  the  building  and  fire
safety  communities  to  assure  that  there  is  a  complete  understanding  of  the  WTC
recommendations and to provide needed technical assistance in getting them imple-
mented.  The  Hurricane  Katrina  assessment  will  not  take  resources  from  the  WTC
investigation follow-up.
Q4. In your testimony, you said that NIST’s recommendations are achievable within
‘‘a reasonable period of time.’’ How long will that be? Will NIST set some bench-
marks to guide its activities to promote implementation?

A4. NIST  is  committed,  working  through  the  various  building  code  organizations,
to  meeting  the  March  deadline  of  the  next  code  development  cycle  of  the  Inter-
national  Code  Council  with  as  many  of  the  recommendations  as  appropriate  and
possible.  I  have  assigned  top  priority  for  NIST  staff  to  work  vigorously  with  the
building  and  fire  safety  communities  to  assure  that  there  is  a  complete  under-
standing of the recommendations and to provide needed technical assistance in get-
ting  them  implemented.  We  have  identified  specific  codes,  standards,  and  practices
affected by each of the recommendations in the summary report for the WTC towers
and already begun to reach out to the responsible organizations to pave the way for
a  timely,  expedited  consideration  of  the  recommendations.  We  also  have  awarded  a
contract  to  the  National  Institute  of  Building  Sciences  (NIBS)  to  convene  a  panel
of  building  code  experts  to  turn  appropriate  recommendations  into  code  language

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

97

suitable for submission of code change proposals to the two national model code de-
velopers.

The  timeline  for  achieving  the  recommendations  is  governed  by  the  established
development  cycle  for  each  of  the  impacted  national  standards,  codes,  practice
guidelines or regulations. For example, the model codes follow a three-year develop-
ment cycle with the next edition due in 2009. The IBC also will issue a supplement
in 2007 based on code change proposals submitted by March 2006. The next edition
of  ASCE  7,  a  key  standard,  is  due  in  2010.  Many  other  standards  have  an  ad  hoc
development cycle.

Working  in  partnership  with  NIBS,  NIST  will  target  the  IBC’s  2007  supplement
as  well  as  the  2009  editions  of  the  model  codes.  In  addition,  NIST  will  work  with
ASCE  and  the  other  standards  developers  to  target  their  appropriate  next  edition.
In  carrying  out  this  work,  NIST  recognizes  that  not  all  of  the  recommendations
will  have  an  impact  on  model  building  codes.  Many  will  impact  standards  that  are
referenced  in  model  codes.  Others  will  impact  stand  alone  standards  used  in  prac-
tice  but  not  referenced  in  model  codes.  A  few  will  impact  practices,  including  edu-
cation  and  training,  that  don’t  have  any  impact  on  codes  and  standards.  In  many
cases,  a  standard  will  need  to  be  developed  before  the  recommendation  can  be  im-
plemented in the model codes.

In  addition,  we  will  implement  a  web-based  system  so  that  the  public  can  track
progress  on  implementing  the  recommendations.  The  web  site,  which  is  already
operational, will list each of the recommendations, the specific organization or orga-
nizations  (e.g.,  standards  and  code  developers,  professional  groups,  State  and  local
authorities)  responsible  for  its  implementation,  the  status  of  its  implementation  by
organization, and the plans or work in progress to implement the recommendations.
The web site is available at http://wtc.nist.gov/recommendations/ and includes de-
tailed information on the work with NIBS. The web site will be updated with infor-
mation on plans and status by the end of January 2006.
Q5. In  terms  of  how  a  building  safety  investigation  should  be  conducted,  what  are
the  three  most  important  lessons  derived  from  NIST’s  experience  with  World
Trade Center buildings?

A5. The  experience  gained  from  the  WTC  investigation  will  help  NIST  to  better
plan and execute future investigations. Examples of the challenges include:

data from external sources.

• The  need  to  identify,  collect,  index,  review,  and  analyze  massive  amounts  of
• The need to model and validate extraordinarily complex and multi-step phys-
ical  and  failure  processes  in  large-scale  systems  that  required  advancements
in  the  state-of-the-art  and  tested  the  limits  of  current  commercial  software.
• The  need  to  design  first  person  interview  protocols,  based  on  rigorous  social
science methods, which could be used to draw definitive results and be gener-
alized  to  make  well  founded  recommendations  for  improving  evacuation  and
emergency response procedures.

Q6. You  testified  that  more  data  and  research  are  needed  to  implement  some  of
NIST’s  recommendations.  In  your  statement  you  said  ‘‘there  is  a  number  of  re-
search and development programs, for example, that come out in this report. In
fact,  the  report  actually  highlights  where  some  of  the  R&D  efforts  are. . .a  lot
of  them  fall  under  NIST  to  try  to  execute.’’  Please  summarize  NIST’s  research
plan based on the WTC report recommendations.

A6. NIST  has  a  number  of  on-going  research  and  development  projects  as  part  of
its  WTC  response  plan  which  address  needs  set  forth  in  the  WTC  report.  These
projects include:

erties

• Prevention of Progressive Collapse
• Fire Resistance Design and Retrofit of Structures
• Fire Resistive Coatings for Structural Steel
• Fire  Resistance  of  Uncoated  Structural  Steel  with  Improved  Thermal  Prop-
• Fire Resistance of Building Partitions
• Occupant Behavior and Egress
• Emergency Use of Elevators
• Equipment Standards for First Responders
• Standard Building Information Models for Vulnerability Assessment
• Technologies for Building Operations in CBR Attacks

98
• Cost-effective Risk Management Tools

In  addition,  NIST  has  on-going  research  in  areas  relevant  to  building  and  fire

safety. These include:

• High  Performance  Construction  Materials  and  Systems:  Enable  scientific  and
technology-based  innovation  to  modernize  and  enhance  the  performance  of
construction materials and systems.
• Fire Loss Reduction: Enable engineered fire safety for people, products, facili-
ties;  and  enhanced  firefighter  effectiveness  with  50  percent  reduction  in  fa-
talities.
• Enhanced Building Performance: Provide the means to assure buildings work

better throughout their useful lives.

Q7. In  written  testimony  submitted  to  the  Committee,  the  American  Institute  of  Ar-
chitects  points  to  the  lack  of  afire  test  facility  in  United  States—a  facility  large
enough to test components of a tall building—as a major shortcoming in the Na-
tion’s  ability  to  improve  skyscraper  safety.  Is  the  maintenance  and  operation  of
large-scale  fire  testing  capability  a  NIST  responsibility,  or  does  it  lie  elsewhere
in  the  Federal  Government  or  the  private  sector?  How  do  you  respond  to  the
AIA’s comments?

A7. NIST agrees with AIA that fire testing of large building components under load
conditions  is  a  vital  need  that  is  not  available  in  the  United  States  at  this  time.
Recommendation #5 recognizes this need by stating ‘‘A key step in fulfilling this rec-
ommendation  is  to  establish  a  capability  for  studying  and  testing  the  components,
assemblies, and systems under realistic fire and load conditions.’’

As  the  Federal  Government’s  principal  fire  research  laboratory,  NIST  maintains
some  of  the  country’s  best  and  most  extensive  fire  testing  facilities.  More  than  400
fire  experiments  are  performed  each  year  in  the  specially  equipped,  27m  (90  ft.)  x
37m  (120  ft.),  Large  Fire  Research  Facility.  However,  this  facility  is  not  capable  of
conducting fire tests under load conditions currently.

NIST  has  held  discussions  with  the  major  fire  testing  laboratories  and  the  aca-
demic  community  to  help  define  the  requirements  for  such  a  fire  testing  capability
in  the  United  States.  In  addition,  NIST  is  considering  how  its  Large  Fire  Research
Facility could be modified to meet this national need.
Q8. Some critics argue that, since most fires that result in fatalities occur in residen-
tial buildings, particularly homes, the focus on skyscraper safety is a distraction
from more common threats to life and property. How do you respond to this crit-
icism?

A8. We  do  not  believe  the  focus  of  the  NIST  investigation  into  the  collapse  of  the
buildings  at  the  World  Trade  Center  is  a  distraction  from  the  impact  of  or  need  to
address the losses from residential fires. NIST has an assigned responsibility to en-
able better fire safety for people, products, and facilities; and to enhance fire fighter
effectiveness  and  continue  to  place  a  high  priority  on  programs  and  activities  that
impact the threats from residential fires. The U.S. annual losses attributable to fire
are nearly 3600 lives, 22,000 serious injuries, $10 billion in direct property loss, and
$128 billion total cost. NIST’s fire research programs work to: enable safer and more
effective  fire  service  operations  through  new  technology,  measurement  standards,
and  training  tools;  develop  effective  strategies  for  cost-effectively  reducing  the  Na-
tion’s  fire  losses  (both  human  and  financial)  by  limiting  fire  growth  and  spread  in
and  to  residences;  provide  the  fundamental  knowledge,  algorithms,  and  measure-
ment techniques necessary for advancing engineered fire safety for people, products,
facilities, and first responders; and provide the infrastructure necessary to facilitate
the  transfer  of  NIST-developed  technology  into  practice  through  participation  with
codes  and  standards  organizations,  maintenance  of  the  premier  international  re-
search bibliography and electronic data for the fire community, and the development
of  laboratory  facilities  with  a  premium  on  accurate,  innovative  and  safe  large-scale
fire experiments.
Q9. Testimony  submitted  to  the  Science  Committee  by  the  Building  Owners  and
Managers Association (BOMA) calls for the development of cost-benefit analyses
on  the  implementation  of  NIST’s  recommendations.  Do  believe  this  is  a  good
idea?  Why  or  why  not?  If  so,  what  would  NIST  do  to  develop  these  analyses?
A9. The  NIST  recommendations  do  not  prescribe  specific  systems,  materials,  or
technologies.  Instead,  NIST  encourages  competition  among  alternatives  that  can
meet performance requirements. The recommendations also do not prescribe specific
threshold levels; NIST believes that this responsibility properly falls within the pur-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

99

view of the public policy setting process, in which the standards and codes develop-
ment process plays a key role. Cost-to-benefit would be an inherent part of this proc-
ess.

Only  a  few  of  the  recommendations  call  for  new  requirements  in  standards  and
codes.  Most  of  the  recommendations  deal  with  improving  an  existing  standard  or
code  requirement,  establishing  a  standard  for  an  existing  practice  without  one,  es-
tablishing the technical basis for an existing requirement, making a current require-
ment  risk-consistent,  adopting  or  enforcing  a  current  requirement,  or  establishing
a performance-based alternative to a current prescriptive requirement.
Q10. Attached  is  testimony  submitted  to  the  Committee  from  the  Building  Owners
and  Managers  Association  (BOMA).  Please  review  this  testimony  and  provide
the  Committee  with  comments  on  the  issues  that  BOMA  raises  on  the  rec-
ommendations.

A10. The review of the WTC recommendations contained in BOMA’s testimony was
received and reviewed by NIST during the public comment period for the draft WTC
reports.  Based  on  the  comments,  it  appears  BOMA  concurs  with  or  is  in  general
agreement  with  11  of  the  30  recommendations,  did  not  have  a  comment  on  seven
recommendations, was concerned with six of the recommendations (e.g., due to cost
or  risk  justification),  considered  two  recommendations  to  be  vague,  and  requested
clarification or did not adequately understand four of the recommendations.

In  a  few  cases,  BOMA  cited  a  lack  of  history  to  suggest  that  tall  buildings  face
increased risk. First, the excellent safety record of tall buildings that is cited by crit-
ics is based mostly on data from roughly the past 30 years. Such historical statistics,
however,  do  not  adequately  capture  rare  design  events  due  to  a  lack  of  data  at  the
tails  of  probability  distributions.  For  example,  buildings  which  have  useful  lives  of
as  much  as  100  years  are  often  designed  for  a  500-year  hurricane  or  a  2,500-year
earthquake. Statistical data over, for example, a 30- to 50-year period would not be
able to adequately capture the rare events that should be considered in design. Sec-
ond, the aim of design is to anticipate rare design events in a rational manner. Un-
anticipated  events  have  surprised  the  design  community  in  the  past,  most  notably
after  the  1994  Northridge  earthquake  when  safety  concerns  were  identified  in  a
widely  used  type  of  steel  building  and  the  industry  had  to  improve  building  codes
and  standards  for  such  buildings.  Third,  for  a  given  threat,  the  risks  increase  with
building  height  since  the  consequences  of  the  threat  become  more  severe  with
height.

Some  of  the  WTC  recommendations  were  considered  by  BOMA  not  to  be  ade-
quately  specific.  The  NIST  recommendations  do  not  prescribe  specific  systems,  ma-
terials,  or  technologies.  Instead,  NIST  encourages  competition  among  alternatives
that  can  meet  performance  requirements.  The  recommendations  also  do  not  pre-
scribe  specific  threshold  levels;  NIST  believes  that  this  responsibility  properly  falls
within  the  purview  of  the  public  policy  setting  process,  in  which  the  standards  and
codes development process plays a key role. The issue of specificity will be resolved
as  part  of  NIST’s  ongoing  efforts  with  NIBS  in  support  of  model  code  changes  (one
of  the  NIBS  building  code  experts  is  a  BOMA  representative)  and  with  standards
organizations.

The  basis  for  some  of  the  WTC  recommendations  was  not  adequately  understood
by BOMA. NIST is working actively with the standards, codes, and industry organi-
zations, including BOMA, to develop a shared understanding of the basis for the rec-
ommendations and to provide needed clarification and justification. The private sec-
tor  inputs  will  lead  to  requirements  that  are  appropriate  for  adoption  in  standards
and codes.

In a few instances, BOMA suggests an incremental approach to adopting the rec-
ommendations.  NIST  believes  that  strong  industry  commitment  to  working  such
issues will lead to early implementation of acceptable solutions.

Please see the answer to Question 9 that address cost concerns with a few of the

recommendations.

Questions submitted by the Minority
Q1. Dr.  Jeffrey,  what  interactions  and  information  has  NIST  shared  with  the  Gen-
eral Services Administration (GSA) about the findings of its World Trade Center
investigation. Could this information be useful for the development of standards
for federal buildings at risk such as embassies?

A1. NIST has had several interactions with GSA on its WTC response plan, includ-
ing  the  WTC  investigation.  Most  recently,  six  members  of  the  GSA  staff  attended
the  WTC  Technical  Conference  held  at  NIST  September  13–15,  2005.  GSA  also  is

co-funding  a  multi-year  research  and  development  project  at  NIST  on  emergency
use  of  elevators.  NIST  has  an  agreement  with  GSA  to  implement  a  demonstration
project  in  a  federal  building  where  protected  occupant  evacuation  and  fire  service
elevators  will  be  installed,  meeting  all  of  the  proposed  standards  and  code  require-
ments  based  on  the  WTC  investigation.  In  addition,  NIST  is  working  with  GSA  to
collect occupant behavior data during evacuation drills within GSA buildings. NIST
has working relationships with GSA and State Department staff on its research and
development  program  to  prevent  progressive  collapse  in  buildings.  Staff  from  these
agencies  have  participated  in  NIST  workshops  and  provided  reviews  of  draft  guid-
ance documents.
Q2. Dr. Jeffrey, NIST believes that its recommendations are achievable within a rea-
sonable  period  of  time.  In  your  view,  what  is  the  shortest  time  period  that  the
NIST recommendations could be implemented?

A2. NIST  is  committed,  working  through  the  various  building  code  organizations,
to  meeting  the  March  deadline  of  the  next  code  development  cycle  of  the  Inter-
national Code Council with as many of the recommendations as possible. I have as-
signed top priority for NIST staff to work vigorously with the building and fire safe-
ty  communities  to  assure  that  there  is  a  complete  understanding  of  the  rec-
ommendations  and  to  provide  needed  technical  assistance  in  getting  them  imple-
mented. We have identified specific codes, standards, and practices affected by each
of  the  recommendations  in  its  summary  report  for  the  WTC  towers  and  already
begun  to  reach  out  to  the  responsible  organizations  to  pave  the  way  for  a  timely,
expedited  consideration  of  the  recommendations.  We  have  also  has  awarded  a  con-
tract  to  the  National  Institute  of  Building  Sciences  (NIBS)  to  convene  a  panel  of
building code experts to turn appropriate recommendations into code language suit-
able  for  submission  of  code  change  proposals  to  the  two  national  model  code  devel-
opers.

The  timeline  for  achieving  the  recommendations  is  governed  by  the  established
development  cycle  for  each  of  the  impacted  national  standards,  codes,  practice
guidelines or regulations. For example, the model codes follow a three-year develop-
ment cycle with the next edition due in 2009. The IBC also will issue a supplement
in 2007 based on code change proposals submitted by March 2006. The next edition
of  ASCE  7,  a  key  standard,  is  due  in  2010.  Many  other  standards  have  an  ad  hoc
development cycle.

Working  in  partnership  with  NIBS,  NIST  will  target  the  IBC’s  2007  supplement
as  well  as  the  2009  editions  of  the  model  codes.  In  addition,  NIST  will  work  with
ASCE  and  the  other  standards  developers  to  target  their  appropriate  next  edition.
In  carrying  out  this  work,  NIST  recognizes  that  not  all  of  the  recommendations
will  have  an  impact  on  model  building  codes.  Many  will  impact  standards  that  are
referenced  in  model  codes.  Others  will  impact  stand  alone  standards  used  in  prac-
tice  but  not  referenced  in  model  codes.  A  few  will  impact  practices,  including  edu-
cation  and  training,  that  don’t  have  any  impact  on  codes  and  standards.  In  many
cases,  a  standard  will  need  to  be  developed  before  the  recommendation  can  be  im-
plemented in the model codes.

In  addition,  we  will  implement  a  web-based  system  so  that  the  public  can  track
progress  on  implementing  the  recommendations.  The  web  site,  which  is  already
operational, will list each of the recommendations, the specific organization or orga-
nizations  (e.g.,  standards  and  code  developers,  professional  groups,  state  and  local
authorities)  responsible  for  its  implementation,  the  status  of  its  implementation  by
organization, and the plans or work in progress to implement the recommendations.
The web site is available at http://wtc.nist.gov/recommendations/ and includes de-
tailed information on the work with NIBS. The web site will be updated with infor-
mation on plans and status by the end of January 2006.
Q3. What specific plans does NIST have to inform local officials about the safety im-

plications of it recommendations?

A3. NIST has been and is reaching out to all communities involved in building and
fire  safety.  We  have  strongly  urged  that  immediate  and  serious  consideration  be
given  to  these  recommendations  by  the  building  and  fire  safety  communities  in
order  to  achieve  appropriate  improvements  in  the  way  buildings  are  designed,  con-
structed,  maintained,  and  used  and  in  evacuation  and  emergency  response  proce-
dures—with  the  goal  of  making  buildings,  occupants,  and  first  responders  safer  in
future emergencies.

We  are  also  strongly  urging  building  owners  and  public  officials  to  (1)  evaluate
the  safety  implications  of  these  recommendations  to  their  existing  inventory  of
buildings and (2) take the steps necessary to mitigate any unwarranted risks with-
out  waiting  for  changes  to  occur  in  codes,  standards,  and  practices.  We  are  urging

State  and  local  agencies  to  rigorously  enforce  building  codes  and  standards  since
such  enforcement  is  critical  to  ensure  the  expected  level  of  safety.  Unless  they  are
complied  with,  the  best  codes  and  standards  cannot  protect  occupants,  emergency
responders, or buildings.

NIST  experts  have  been  meeting  with  state  and  local  officials  over  the  past  year
providing them with information on NIST’s investigation. In September, NIST held
a  conference  attended  by  over  200  experts  from  standards  developing  organization,
state  and  local  officials,  fire  fighting  organizations  and  builders.  Throughout  the
course of our investigation, NIST’s work has received major media coverage—includ-
ing  by  media  outlets  followed  closely  by  building,  fire,  and  other  emergency  pre-
paredness and response officials.
Q4. Dr. Jeffrey, what will be the impediments to translating the NIST recommenda-
tions to improvements to building codes and emergency response and evacuation
procedures?

A4. There  are  a  number  of  features  intrinsic  to  the  building  and  fire  safety  regu-
latory system in the United States that affect the speed and outcome of the change
process for codes, standards, and practices.

a large number of private sector standards development organizations.

• First, building and fire safety regulations, promulgated and enforced by State
and  local  jurisdictions,  are  based  on  national  model  codes  developed  by  pri-
vate sector organizations.
• Second,  the  model  codes  adopt  by  reference  standards  that  are  developed  by
• Third,  the  process  and  schedule  for  consideration  of  changes  differ  for  each
• Fourth,  changes  to  codes  and  standards  are  based  on  the  review  and  con-
sensus  approval  of  committees  comprising  a  spectrum  of  interests  and  per-
spectives.

code or standard.

The  above  process  accommodates  the  inputs  and  concerns  of  a  wide  range  of
groups—including  architects,  engineers,  developers,  owners,  operators,  users,  emer-
gency  responders,  State  and  local  regulatory  officials,  policy-makers,  and  concerned
citizens.  Incorporating  these  inputs  into  regulations  is  complex,  but  the  system  has
evolved  into  one  that  balances  the  sometimes  contradictory  desires  of  the  various
groups while providing for public safety and welfare.

NIST  has  identified  37  specific  national  model  codes,  standards,  practice  guide-
lines,  or  regulations  impacted  by  its  recommendations.  We  have  called  on  the  var-
ious  organizations  for  a  timely  consideration  of  these  recommendations.  We  have
hosted  a  conference  where  every  major  standards  and  code  developer  was  rep-
resented,  we  have  hired  NIBS  to  assist  in  converting  the  appropriate  recommenda-
tions into draft code language, and we are working with organizations representing
local and State authorities to assist in their adoption and enforcement.
Q5. Dr.  Jeffrey,  how  much  funding  will  NIST  require  to  carry  out  its  follow-on  du-

ties in the area of research during the next three years?

A5. The  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget  requested  $2M  for  NIST  to  carry  out
research  to  enable  development  and  adoption  of  cost-effective  technical  solutions  to
enhance  safety  and  avoid  major  disasters  through  improved  first  responder  equip-
ment,  better  evacuation  and  emergency  response  procedures,  and  risk-sensitive  na-
tional  practices  for  building  safety.  The  FY  2006  Commerce,  Justice,  State  and
Science Appropriations Act does not contain funding for this request.
Q6. Dr. Jeffrey, for two years the National Construction Safety Team Advisory Com-
mittee  has  reiterated  that  successful  implementation  of  the  National  Construc-
tion  Safety  Team  (NCST)  Act  is  dependent  upon  the  creation  of  a  NCST  office
funded  at  $2  million  and  the  establishment  of  a  $2  million  reserve  fund.  Why
hasn’t NIST acted upon these recommendations in its budget request?

A6. NIST  believes  that  it  has  responded  appropriately  to  all  significant  disaster
events  worthy  of  investigation.  The  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget  requested
$2M  for  NIST  to  carry  out  research  to  enable  development  and  adoption  of  cost-ef-
fective  technical  solutions  to  enhance  safety  and  avoid  major  disasters  through  im-
proved first responder equipment, better evacuation and emergency response proce-
dures,  and  risk-sensitive  national  practices  for  building  safety.  The  FY  2006  Com-
merce,  Justice,  State  and  Science  Appropriations  Act  does  not  contain  funding  for
this request.
Q7. Dr. Jeffrey, the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Advisory Committee
has  recommended  that  the  Act  be  invoked  after  any  natural  disaster  such  as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

102

earthquakes, hurricanes and other windstorms, floods and wildfires. Why didn’t
you  invoke  the  Act  after  Hurricanes  Katrina,  Rita  and  now  Wilma?  In  their  re-
ports to Congress the Advisory Committee has generally been critical that NIST
has not invoked the Act more often. Why do you disagree with the recommenda-
tions of the Advisory Committee?

A7. NIST authorities are ‘‘tools’’ by which we can conduct an investigation. We will
always  pick  the  best  tool  to  get  the  job  done.  In  response  to  Hurricane  Katrina,
NIST is using authorities that are broader than under the NCST Act and better fit
the specific situation.

In  addition  to  major  buildings  and  residential  structures,  the  current  effort  in-
volves  key  infrastructure  facilities  (electric  power,  water  and  wastewater,  oil  and
gas,  and  communication)  and  transportation  (ports,  pipelines,  bridges,  roads,  and
airports) which are not covered by the NCST Act.

Moreover,  NIST  is  interested  in  assessing  the  performance  not  only  of  facilities
that ‘‘failed’’ but also those that sustained ‘‘damage’’—and hence not covered by the
NCST.

In  addition,  NIST  is  assessing  the  damage  not  only  to  structures  but  also  other
building  systems  (e.g.,  the  roofing  system,  fire  safety,  and  HVAC)  which  are  not
specified in the Act.
Q8. Dr.  Jeffrey,  some  of  Ms.  Regenhard’s  and  Dr.  Corbett’s  criticisms  of  NIST’s  re-
luctance  to  use  the  full  authority  of  the  National  Construction  Safety  Team
(NCST)  Act  are  echoed  by  the  NCST  Advisory  Board.  What  is  your  response?
A8. NIST believes that it has used appropriately the authority of the National Con-
struction Safety Team Act. NIST has obtained all available documents and evidence
essential  to  carrying  out  a  thorough  and  credible  technical  investigation.  NIST  be-
lieves the findings from its investigation are well justified on the basis of those doc-
uments and evidence.

A  large  number  of  individuals  and  organizations  provided  materials  and  docu-
ments, including the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Silverstein Prop-
erties, the City of New York and its departments, the manufacturers and fabricators
of the building components, the companies that insured the WTC towers, the build-
ing tenants, the aircraft manufacturers, the airlines, the public (including survivors
and  family  members),  and  the  media.  NIST  officials  reviewed  tens  of  thousands  of
pages  of  documents,  conducted  interviews  with  over  a  thousand  people;  and  ana-
lyzed  236  pieces  of  steel  that  were  obtained  from  the  wreckage.  At  no  time  was
NIST reluctant to use the full authority of the NCST.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Nancy McNabb, Director, Government Affairs, National Fire Protection

Association

Questions submitted by the Majority
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  said  that  NIST  takes  some  positions  on  ‘‘controversial
and  sometimes  unpopular  subjects.’’  What  do  you  have  in  mind?  What  should
NIST do to make sure that controversy doesn’t block progress?

A1. I would point to subjects such as progressive collapse design, wind tunnel test-
ing and the recommendation to include fire protection engineers on the design team.
NIST has set an agenda for codes and standards organizations and the private sec-
tor to determine how best to manage change (if any) in all 30 areas. NIST can best
serve  as  an  advisor  to  those  groups  and  when  necessary,  fund  research  in  the  pri-
vate sector to establish additional information and possible solutions.
Q2. In your testimony you stated that ‘‘the need to conduct more research in numer-
ous  areas  is  clear.’’  What  are  the  top  three  priority  areas  where  additional  re-
search  and  data  are  needed?  Which  specific  entities  should  be  doing  this  re-
search? Which recommendations are most hampered by lack of data?

A2. Elevator  Use:  These  criteria  are  very  close  to  being  finalized.  The  reality  is
that  elevator  use  is  the  only  practical  way  to  ensure  timely  building  evacuation  in
very  tall  (40-story)  buildings.  Additional  research  may  also  benefit  disabled  occu-
pants by providing equal access to self evacuation capability in many types of multi-
story buildings. The current ASME/NIST research project, in which NFPA has been
a significant participant, has been underway since 2003.
Coordinated communication capabilities: This is an Achilles heel in most major
events including many high rise fires. Major natural disasters also present commu-
nication challenges between the various responding entities. Research groups: NFPA
and IEEE.
Fire  test  procedures/materials:  Reliability  of  the  test  procedures,  materials  and
field  applications  are  all  interrelated.  Innovative  materials  have  potential  use,  but
progress on all of these issues may be stymied absent additional data demonstrating
clear  cost  effective  advantages  associated  with  such  new  materials  or  deficiencies
with the current materials and test methods. Research groups: FPRF/ASTM/UL
Q3. Building  trade  associations  have  raised  concerns  that  the  implementation  of
some  of  the  recommendations  will  be  expensive.  Which  of  the  recommendations
do you believe will be most costly? Would these costs be justified in terms of their
expected outcomes?

A3. Building  trade  associations  and  building  associations  such  as  BOMA  are  likely
concerned that any change to building safety requirements will increase cost. Short-
term costs associated with building safety should not be the prime concern. BOMA’s
tenants and the public at large are a good barometer of how safe our buildings need
to  be  and  they  do  not  generally  object  to  initial  costs  for  providing  long-term  build-
ing and life safety.
Q4. In  written  testimony  submitted  to  the  Committee,  the  American  Institute  of  Ar-
chitects points to the lack of a fire test facility in United States—a facility large
enough to test components of a tall building—as a major shortcoming in the Na-
tion’s  ability  to  improve  skyscraper  safety.  Is  the  maintenance  and  operation  of
large-scale  fire  testing  capability  a  NIST  responsibility,  or  does  it  lie  elsewhere
in  the  Federal  Government  or  the  private  sector?  How  do  you  respond  to  the
AIA’s comments?

A4. The  private  sector  should  retain  control  and  operation  of  the  largest  fire  test
facilities.  NIST  may  best  work  in  a  private/public  sector  partnership  role  to  assist
with  funding  of  expanded  test  facilities  at  Underwriters  Laboratories  (UL)  or  Fac-
tory Mutual (FM) or preferably both.
Q5. Testimony  submitted  to  the  Science  Committee  by  the  Building  Owners  and
Managers  Association  (BOMA)  calls  for  cost-benefit  analyses  to  be  developed  on
the  implementation  of  NIST’s  recommendations.  Do  you  believe  this  is  a  good
idea? Why or why not? If so, who should develop these analyses?

A5. Cost-benefit forecasts for safety related issues are a no win approach to chang-
ing  codes,  standards  and  protocols.  As  repeatedly  expressed  by  BOMA  at  federal,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00117 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

114

State and local hearings, their primary concern seems to be initial construction costs
rather  than  long  tern  sustainability  or  safety  of  their  tenants.  Cost-benefit  can  al-
most always be used to argue a change in any direction. It is NFPA’s view that cost
benefit analyses should not be a primary consideration in the debate for implemen-
tation of these potential changes.
Q6. Which  recommendations  do  you  think  most  require  action  by  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment, particularly with respect to research, and which agencies should be re-
sponsible?

A6. At this point, it is NFPA’s view that the private sector, with funding from fed-
eral  agencies  (including  NIST)  are  in  the  best  position  to  pursue  the  level  of  detail
needed  to  move  towards  change.  Competition  to  develop  better  materials,  methods
and designs can be driven by code-related change and social awareness; no one enti-
ty should have a sole source advantage for building research.

Questions submitted by Democratic Members
Q1. Ms.  McNabb,  your  organization  has  moved  forward  on  a  number  of  the  NIST
recommendations.  How  have  the  NFPA  code  changes  been  greeted  by  the  user
community—for example, states and localities and the building industry?

A1. NFPA  code  changes  have  been  met  with  mixed  reaction  by  various  interest
groups.  For  example,  various  groups,  including  the  U.S.  General  Services  Adminis-
tration (GSA) filed appeals against some of the new changes such as the provisions
to  increase  the  stair  width  for  certain  buildings.  NFPA’s  Building  Code  has  been
met with resistance by a number of jurisdictions and trade associations representing
the  economic  building  owner  interests.  Many  of  these  groups  are  designated  as
‘‘Code  Partners’’  of  the  ICC  thus  they  align  themselves  with  technical  provisions
that  are  more  traditional  and  in  many  cases,  several  years  behind  what  the  NFPA
codes  require.  First  responders  and  tenant  representatives  have  embraced  NFPA
code  provisions  as  they  reflect  the  state  of  the  art.  The  NFPA  code  development
process  ensures  broad  representation  for  all  of  the  construction  community  stake-
holders  including  first  responders,  tenant  representatives  and  those  designated  as
‘‘code partners.’’
Q2. Ms.  McNabb,  you  mention  that  ‘‘it  is  likely,  that  after  a  through  and  detailed
analysis  of  the  final  recommendations,  there  may  not  be  sufficient  data,  detail
or  compelling  evidence  to  promulgate  a  change  to  a  particular  safety  code  or
standard.’’ What is the timeframe for this analysis? Also, which of the NIST rec-
ommendations do you think most likely to fail this analysis?

A2. Some  of  the  analyses  will  be  complex  such  as  Recommendation  1  concerning
progressive  collapse  criteria.  We  believe  that  work  will  take  several  years  because
it requires the development of a design approach (supported by analytical tools and
practical guidance) to determine how much of a building’s structural support system
will be lost and an expectation of how long the structure must remain standing.

The  recommendations  concerning  fire  test  protocols  will  require  approximately
two years of review. At present, the main concern seems to be that ‘‘the test proce-
dures  have  been  used  for  90  years,’’  the  implication  being  that  we  should  be  doing
something  different.  There  is  no  obvious  reason  to  change  the  fire  test  protocols;
after  thorough  study  and  review,  we  may  determine  that  the  status  quo  is  accept-
able.
Q3. Ms.  McNabb,  could  you  give  us  an  idea  of  the  follow-on  work  required  before

we can arrive at an appropriate ‘‘best practices’’ for the built environment?

A3. Best practices are always moving forward. In the last few years, changes to the
NFPA  codes  such  as  increases  to  hourly  fire  resistance  ratings  for  structural  sys-
tems in high rise buildings, wider stairs and provisions that have been in our codes
for a longer time such as requirements for automatic sprinkler retrofits in high rise
buildings, are all examples of best practices for the built environment that were ini-
tially determined by NFPA technical committees.

Code  changes  such  as  greater  use  of  elevators  for  building  evacuations  by  occu-
pants  and  first  responders  will  likely  be  ready  for  consideration  in  the  code  change
cycle  within  the  next  year.  One  issue  that  must  be  addressed  is  that  of  liability.
After  decades  of  indoctrinating  building  occupants  that  use  of  the  elevator  in  a  fire
emergency is prohibited, there will naturally be concerns about reversing that mes-
sage.  Likewise,  concerns  related  to  elevator  equipment  malfunction  during  emer-
gency conditions must be overcome.

Mass  notification  systems  discussed  in  Recommendations  22  and  23  will  be  a  re-
ality  in  2006  when  the  technical  provisions  for  these  systems  have  been  proposed
to be incorporated in the next edition of NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Code.

The  largest  obstacle  to  establishing  best  practices  will  be  the  extent,  if  any,  to
which  such  code  changes  will  affect  the  existing  building  stock.  Such  implementa-
tions  are  often  initially  expensive  or  technically  infeasible.  The  U.S.  General  Serv-
ices Administration (GSA) could provide an example for the commercial building in-
dustry  by  embracing  this  opportunity  to  include  new  building  safety  enhancements
in their construction plans and leasing agreements.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by James R. Harris, President, J.R. Harris and Company; Member, Amer-

ican Society of Civil Engineers

Please note that these responses are, in general, confined to the subject of structural
engineering.  Some  of  the  recommendations  made  by  NIST  concern  subjects  outside
the expertise of civil and structural engineers.

Questions submitted by the Majority
Q1. In her testimony, Ms. McNabb said that the recommendation related to elevators
may  be  one  of  the  most  important.  Do  you  agree?  How  difficult  would  that  be
to  codify  and  implement?  Can  you  give  the  Committee  a  sense  of  what  specific
next steps you would take to evaluate that recommendation and what additional
information you would need and from whom?

A1. Most  of  the  issues  surrounding  this  recommendation  do  not  concern  structural
engineering. The primary structural issue here is the provision of strong shaft walls,
and  that  is  not  particularly  difficult.  Ms.  McNabb  may  have  been  referring  to  pro-
tection  of  the  elevator  and  its  controls  from  fire  where  it  would  be  intended  to  use
the  elevator  to  pass  through  stories  with  uncontrolled  fire.  This  is  a  phenomenon
that  should  be  tested  to  verify  potential  solutions  before  any  code  requirement  is
implemented, but it is not, fundamentally, a structural issue.
Q2. In  your  testimony,  you  suggested  that  codes  are  not  necessarily  the  best  way  to
promote  changes  in  practice.  What  is  the  problem  with  using  codes?  What  are
the  alternatives?  What  NIST  recommendations  should  be  implemented  through
means other than codes?

A2. Codes  are  a  useful  and  effective  mechanism  to  assure  a  minimum  level  of  pro-
tection where proven technologies exist. However, they are not particularly effective
where  the  issue  requires  development  of  new  technology.  I  will  use  performance-
based  design  for  fire  resistance  as  an  example.  Here  the  codes  can  be  used  as  an
incentive,  by  allowing  the  possibility  for  performance-based  design,  but  the  method
will  not  be  an  effective  tool  until  several  things  happen:  an  extension  of  present
knowledge  through  targeted  research,  a  critical  mass  of  the  profession  becomes
properly educated and trained to implement the methods, and a change in the legal
climate  to  remove  disincentives  to  this  expansion  of  professional  practice.  This  will
require  changes  in  the  basic  curriculum  to  educate  engineers  of  the  future  as  well
as a broad continuing education program to train practicing professionals.

The  interaction  of  professional  practice  and  tort  law  is  a  matter  of  public  policy
that  requires  careful  consideration  before  the  potential  benefits  of  performance
based fire design can be realized. Prescriptive codes effectively shield structural en-
gineers and architects from tort, and the prescriptive codes for fire resistance do de-
liver  buildings  with  successful  fire  resistance  in  the  vast  majority  of  cases.  There
is  no  incentive  for  engineers  to  become  responsible  for  fire  safety  and  there  is  a
major  disincentive  in  the  form  of  potential  liability  for  fire  damage  and  injury  in
a building designed to a performance standard. These obstacles need to be removed.
Q3. You  testified  that  data  and  research  are  needed  to  implement  some  of  NIST’s
recommendations.  What  are  the  top  three  priority  areas  where  additional  re-
search  and  data  are  needed?  Which  specific  entities  should  be  doing  this  re-
search? Which recommendations are most hampered by lack of data?

A3. From the structural engineering point of view three areas do stand out: improv-
ing  the  general  structural  integrity  of  building  (improve  the  resistance  to  progres-
sive collapse), improving the design of structures to resist wind loads, and perform-
ance-based  design  for  structural  response  to  fire.  The  research  in  the  first  area  is
likely  to  be  a  long-term  effort  before  tools  are  developed  that  will  be  usable  in  rou-
tine  design  practice,  but  it  is  highly  likely  to  bear  fruit.  Structural  connection  de-
tails  that  are  faster,  better,  cheaper  can  readily  be  developed  in  a  program  of  aca-
demic  research,  large  scale  testing,  and  support  of  the  creation  of  technical  provi-
sions  in  codes  and  standards.  The  steel  connection  details  for  improved  seismic  re-
sistance  that  emerged  from  FEMA’s  SAC  project  are  an  example  of  what  can  be
done for a relatively small outlay (overall, this research program will likely be larg-
er, owing to the many different types of construction that must be considered). Pro-
gressive  collapse  resistance  also  needs  a  component  of  social  science  research  in
order  to  better  define  the  needs  and  our  objectives.  The  second  area  will  be  en-
hanced  if  funds  are  appropriated  for  the  already  authorized  National  Windstorm
Mitigation  Program.  Wind  effects  on  buildings  are  a  complex  topic  that  has  long

been  shorted  in  the  federal  research  budget.  NIST’s  findings  and  the  hurricanes  of
the past two years should persuade the Federal Government to be proactive in sup-
porting  wind  research.  The  third  area  requires  close  coordination  between  special-
ists  in  fire  and  structural  engineering  in  order  to  assure  that  the  two  professions
are  communicating  meaningfully,  and  the  disincentives  described  in  the  answer  to
Question 2 should be addressed before large research programs here are funded.
Q4. You expressed a concern about the ‘‘unreasonable acceleration’’ of the codes proc-

ess. What’s your concern? Do you see any indication of that happening?

A4. The concern is that premature attempts to change building codes without thor-
ough  vetting  in  the  voluntary  standards  communities  and  without  compelling  sub-
stantiation  could  create  somewhat  of  a  backlash  or  stigma  around  these  rec-
ommendations,  which  could  ultimately  delay  widespread  implementation.  Realize
that the model building codes, and the standards upon which they rely, are not de-
veloped  by  elected  governmental  bodies  operating  on  a  simple  majority  vote.  They
are  developed  in  voluntary  bodies  that  operate  with  a  formal  consensus  building
procedure, which is necessary to generate the support in industry for successful im-
plementation  of  change,  and  significant  change  requires  significant  time.  In  my
opinion  the  objectives  of  the  NIBS  panel  should  be  to  coordinate  efforts  among  the
many  standards  developing  organizations  and  to  provide  a  forum  for  discussion  of
issues  across  technical  disciplines.  For  most  of  the  issues  of  concern  in  the  struc-
tural  engineering  community  it  is  premature  to  prepare  changes  to  model  building
codes.
Q5. Building  trade  associations  have  raised  concerns  that  the  implementation  of
some  of  the  recommendations  will  be  expensive.  Which  of  the  recommendations
do you believe will be most costly? Would these costs be justified in terms of their
expected outcomes?

A5. In the long run those costs associated with construction, maintenance, and eco-
nomic use of facilities will far overrun the initial costs of educating and training en-
gineers,  architects,  and  building  officials,  although  in  the  short  run  the  latter  costs
will be significant and will likely slow implementation. Reasonable resistance to pro-
gressive  collapse  will  not  cost  much  for  some  structural  systems,  while  in  others  it
will  be  very  costly,  which  will  change  the  relative  market  share  among  competing
products  and  systems  for  those  structures  for  which  resistance  to  progressive  col-
lapse  is  deemed  necessary.  Such  changes  are  usually  slow  to  come  to  fruition.  The
imposition  of  a  limit  on  lateral  drift  under  wind  (Recommendation  Number  3)  will
increase  the  cost  of  structural  framing.  Changes  that  affect  the  economic  use  of
space, such as the provision of larger egress paths (stairwells) can impose very real
costs.  Some  changes  hold  the  potential  for  cost  savings,  such  as  improved  under-
standing of wind effects on buildings and the use of a performance approach for de-
sign  for  fire  resistance.  It  is  likely  that  the  impact  on  construction  cost  for  those
items that do increase the cost will be limited to a few percent of construction cost.
Where these kinds of change are applied equally to all competing products in a mar-
ket, the change may not be as slow.
Q6. In  written  testimony  submitted  to  the  Committee,  the  American  Institute  of  Ar-
chitects points to the lack of a fire test facility in United States—a facility large
enough to test components of a tall building—as a major shortcoming in the Na-
tion’s  ability  to  improve  skyscraper  safety.  Is  the  maintenance  and  operation  of
large-scale  fire  testing  capability  a  NIST  responsibility,  or  does  it  lie  elsewhere
in  the  Federal  Government  or  the  private  sector?  How  do  you  respond  to  the
AIA’s comments?

A6. The  lack  of  a  facility  large  enough  to  test  structural  components  of  practical
size is not limited to tall buildings. Common components of low-rise buildings suffer
the  same  problem.  Some  private  sector  furnaces  in  this  country  have  closed  due  to
a lack of economic demand. Canada and Japan are examples of countries with larg-
er  facilities,  and  those  facilities  are  government  facilities.  That  does  not  mean  that
a  government  test  facility  is  the  only  possible  solution  here,  but  at  the  very  least
there  will  be  a  need  for  government  support  and  incentives.  International  coopera-
tion should be explored.
Q7. Testimony  submitted  to  the  Science  Committee  by  the  Building  Owners  and
Managers  Association  (BOMA)  calls  for  cost-benefit  analyses  to  be  developed  on
the  implementation  of  NIST’s  recommendations.  Do  you  believe  this  is  a  good
idea? Why or why not? If so, who should develop these analyses?

A7. Some aspects of limited cost analysis is commonly necessary to persuade mem-
bers  of  standards  bodies  to  implement  changes,  however,  such  analyses  are  rarely

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00121 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

a rigorous economic study, especially on the benefit side. It is not easy to assess the
true cost of new technology before implementation. Benefits are particularly difficult
to predict. The normal approach is to rely on the judgment of informed professionals
developed in a consensus building process. FEMA funded one moderately large cost
study in the early 1980’s as the Nation was considering the adoption of a new gen-
eration of provisions for seismic safety in construction. A cost-benefit analysis on the
same  topic  has  recently  been  completed  at  the  request  of  the  Congress.  Requiring
formal  cost-benefit  analysis  for  every  change  is  not  typical  in  the  field  of  building
codes and design standards, and it would probably unduly slow implementation.
Q8. Which  recommendations  do  you  think  most  require  action  by  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment, particularly with respect to research, and which agencies should be re-
sponsible?

A8. The bulk of the research described in the answer to Question 3 will require fed-
eral  funding.  Among  the  agencies  that  I  would  expect  to  fund  such  research  are
NSF,  NIST,  and  FEMA.  NIST  has  historically  not  been  able  to  fund  significant  ex-
ternal  research  in  the  building  sciences  area,  and  FEMA’s  future  role  is  not  well
defined as it adapts to its incorporation inside DHS. Perhaps most importantly, the
funding  for  structural  engineering  research  in  the  CMS  (Civil  and  Mechanical  Sys-
tems)  area  of  NSF  is  projected  to  be  reduced  by  a  mere  pittance  compared  to  past
levels.  This  situation  must  be  reversed  to  see  real  progress  in  developing  the  im-
provements recommended by NIST.
Q9. In  your  testimony  regarding  Recommendation  #1  on  progressive  collapse,  you
said that the recommendation needed further study of its application and its ef-
fects  upon  the  profession  because  of  the  various  design  thresholds  involved.
Please explain what you mean by this, what the major points of the study would
be, and who should carry out this work.

A9. NIST  has  tentatively  proposed  a  definition  of  high-rise  buildings  at  420  feet,
which  is  apparently  related  to  common  limitations  on  pumping  water  for  fire  sup-
pression.  There  has  been  discussion  of  using  this  same  threshold  for  application  of
a requirement for resistance to progressive collapse. It is not clear why the two top-
ics need to be correlated. There are many lower buildings that should probably have
such resistance. The General Services Administration has been requiring a measure
of  resistance  to  terrorism  attack  and  progressive  collapse  for  most  federal  court-
houses built in the past several years, and the Department of State has been doing
the same for most of our new overseas embassies, yet none of these buildings would
be more than 420 feet tall. Considerations beyond occupancy and size, including lo-
cation,  will  likely  be  involved.  A  careful,  and  probably  long,  public  discussion  is
needed  to  achieve  a  comprehensive  classification  of  buildings  for  which  this  resist-
ance  is  going  to  be  required  by  law  (as  opposed  to  being  implemented  by  option  of
the  owner).  This  discussion  should  be  supported  by  research  in  the  social  science,
economic  policy,  and  insurance  areas.  Congress  should  lead  at  least  some  of  this
public discussion, because the Federal Government is obviously spending heavily in
response to the September 11 attack, and improving our resistance to other terrorist
attacks  should  be  guided  in  part  by  intelligent  approaches  to  limiting  such  outlays
in the future.

Questions submitted by Democratic Members
Q1. Dr.  Harris,  what  is  the  timeframe  for  your  organization  to  act  upon  the  NIST
recommendations?  How  long  will  it  take  for  any  ASCE  code  revisions  to  occur?
A1. These  recommendations  will  be  a  focus  of  our  activities  for  several  years  to
come.  We  are  in  the  process  of  collecting  public  comment  on  our  new  standard  for
the use of wind tunnel testing in determining design wind loads on buildings, which
is  responsive  in  part  to  a  NIST  recommendation.  In  that  process  we  have  formed
an ad hoc committee to give specific consideration to making our new standard even
more  responsive  to  that  recommendation.  We  expect  the  standard  to  be  formally
issued in 2006. We have just issued the 2005 edition of our standard Minimum De-
sign  Loads  for  Buildings  and  Other  Structures.  This  standard  defines  basic  wind
loads,  among  other  actions  on  structures,  and  contains  guidance  for  resistance  to
progressive collapse. The committee will be reformed in 2006 as we prepare to issue
anew edition in 2010, and plans are already underway to focus specific task groups
on  the  NIST  recommendations.  Should  specific  items  gather  the  necessary  con-
sensus in time, we will be prepared to issue a supplement to our 2005 edition. While
it is reasonable to predict that the 2010 edition will have changes stimulated by the
NIST  recommendations,  it  is  also  true  that  there  will  probably  be  continuing  ad-

vancements in knowledge and therefore in our standards for many years after that.
We  will  also  plan  to  update  our  standard  Structural  Design  for  Fire  Conditions  as
more  information  about  performance-based  design  is  developed.  We  also  have  a
large  number  of  technical  committees  that  operate  to  advance  the  state  of  knowl-
edge in a many areas of interest to structural engineers, and we will be encouraging
such committees with a focus on structural integrity and on wind loads to carefully
review the research needs implicit in the NIST recommendations.
Q2. Dr. Harris, ASCE believes that some of the NIST recommendations need further
clarification  and  discussion.  What  interaction  did  your  organization  have  with
NIST  during  the  course  of  its  investigation  and  while  it  was  drafting  this  re-
port?  For  example,  did  ASCE  participate  in  the  public  sessions  that  NIST  held
in  the  course  of  its  investigations?  Since  the  report  has  been  made  public  have
you had any follow-up conversation with NIST? Do you feel that NIST has been
un-responsive to your concerns?

A2. Recall that our World Trade Center Building Performance Study issued in Sep-
tember 2002 as FEMA report 403 identified many issues needing further study and
served  as  a  starting  point  for  the  NIST  study.  Key  members  of  our  team  behind
FEMA  403  provided  input  as  the  NIST  program  was  being  defined,  and  many
ASCE/SEI  members  have  been  involved  with  review  of  the  NIST  work  at  many
stages. During this year a select group from our Board of Governors had a day-long
briefing  from  the  NIST  leadership  team  in  the  spring,  then  an  electronic  update
shortly  before  the  draft  was  issued  as  the  conclusions  were  firmed.  We  submitted
comments on the draft during the summer, and we have had one additional briefing
as NIST has prepared strawman proposals for changes to the International Building
Code.  It  is  worth  repeating  that  we  believe  NIST’s  study  is  well  done  and  provides
much  to  advance  the  cause  of  public  safety.  NIST  actively  solicited  our  comments
and has listened carefully and respectfully.
Q3. Dr.  Harris,  one  of  the  recommendations  that  ASCE  strongly  endorses  is  con-
tinuing education. This seems an important recommendation as structural mate-
rials  and  techniques  have  changed  so  dramatically  over  the  past  twenty  years.
Currently, what type of courses does ASCE sponsor for the continuing education
of its members? I also noticed from your biography that you are a certified Pro-
fessional Engineer, what does the National Society of Professional Engineers do
in  the  area  of  continuing  education  for  its  members?  What  sort  of  continuing
education courses do you think are needed?

A3. ASCE has an active continuing education program. Among the popular courses
for structural engineers currently being offered are:
• Analysis and Preservation of Historic Bridges
• Bridge Inspection
• Bridge Rehabilitation
• Cable-Stayed Bridges: Key Design, Construction, and Management Issues
• Connection Design for Steel Structures
• Dam Safety and Rehabilitation
• Design and Renovation of Wood Structures
• Design  and  Strengthening  of  Shallow  Foundations  for  Conventional  and  Pre-

Engineered Buildings

• Design of Foundations for Dynamic Loads
• Design of Metal Buildings: Avoid Pitfalls in Specifying and Procuring
• Design, Construction, and Renovation of Masonry Structures

We  also  have  several  popular  Webinars,  and  we  are  planning  a  new  series  of
courses illustrating the new edition of ASCE 7 that we plan to take to a large num-
ber  of  cities.  I  am  not  as  familiar  with  the  continuing  education  program  of  NSPE,
but it is my impression that their continuing education can be divided into two gen-
eral  categories:  technical  information  for  young  engineers  who  are  preparing  for  li-
censing  exams  and  less  technical  information  for  licensed  professionals,  where  the
emphasis tends to be on ethics, professional practice, and similar topics. I would be
happy  to  forward  a  request  for  information  to  NSPE  so  that  you  get  more  accurate
information  about  their  programs,  if  you  desire.  With  respect  to  changes  in  con-
tinuing  education  for  the  future  as  influenced  by  the  NIST  recommendations,  I  be-
lieve  that  analytical  prediction  of  structural  performance  under  fire  conditions  is  a
subject that will be in great demand. More detail about this subject is in our answer
to the general questions for the record.

I would also like to point out that I am registered, not certified, as a professional
engineer by the State of Colorado, among others, and registered as a structural en-
gineer  by  the  State  of  California.  Our  profession  encourages  State  governments  to
recognize  that  structural  engineering  is  a  profession  essential  to  protecting  public
safety, that it requires highly trained specialists with substantial experience for suc-
cess in the endeavor to protect the public, and that these facts justify separate licen-
sure of structural engineers.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Glenn  Corbett,  Assistant  Professor  of  Fire  Science,  John  Jay  College
of Criminal Justice; Member, NIST National Construction Safety Team Advisory
Board

Questions submitted by the Majority
Q1. In her testimony, Ms. McNabb said that the recommendation related to elevators
may  be  one  of  the  most  important.  Do  you  agree?  How  difficult  would  that  be
to  codify  and  implement?  Can  you  give  the  Committee  a  sense  of  what  specific
next steps you would take to evaluate that recommendation and what additional
information you would need and from whom?

A1. Yes,  I  agree  that  the  use  of  elevators  for  egress  in  very  tall  high-rise  buildings
is an important recommendation. Several industry meetings have been held and re-
search has already been conducted on this topic (some of it prior to September 11th,
2001).  1  would  suggest  that  NIST  convene  a  summit  to  establish  what,  if  any,  ‘‘re-
search  holes’’  still  exist  and  quickly  fill  them.  I  believe  we  could  swiftly  move  for-
ward with a model code recommendation if NIST takes this proactive stance.
Q2. If  NIST  had  taken  more  of  a  ‘‘detective’’  approach  to  its  work,  how  might  that

have affected its recommendations?

A2. If  NIST  had  taken  a  more  ‘‘detective’’  approach,  we  may  have  obtained  more
facts that are critical for gaining support for the code recommendations. In addition,
other code-related issues may have surfaced.
Q3. In  terms  of  how  a  building  safety  investigation  should  be  conducted,  what  are
the  three  most  important  lessons  derived  from  NIST’s  experience  with  World
Trade Center buildings?

A3. The  NCST  lessons  of  the  WTC  investigation  (and  the  Station  Nightclub)  are:
quickly  get  to  the  scene  of  the  incident,  quickly  secure  evidence  (critical  steel  was
lost at the WTC prior to enactment of the NCST), swiftly establish an investigation
plan, utilize a ‘‘can-do’’ legal staff that aggressively gains access to information and
physical  evidence,  and  move  forward  to  the  ultimate  goal  of  the  investigation:  spe-
cific recommendations to changes in codes and practices.
Q4. The  WTC  report  concludes  that  some  recommendations  require  more  data  and
research  to  be  implemented.  What  are  the  top  three  priority  areas  where  addi-
tional research and data are needed? Which specific entities should be doing this
research? Which recommendations are most hampered by lack of data?

A4. In  my  opinion,  the  three  priority  areas  are:  1).  the  development  of  a  new  fire
resistance  protocol  to  replace  the  ASTM  E–119  test  standard,  2)  the  development
of more robust fire-resistive coatings for steel members, 3) the development of a reli-
able  radio  communications  system  for  emergency  responders  in  high-rise  and  other
‘‘problem’’ locations. While NIST could be a coordinator for such research, there are
other governmental and private sector organizations that should be involved. In my
opinion, the first two priority areas that I have identified (fire resistance testing and
fire resistive coatings) are the recommendations most hampered by lack of data.
Q5. Building  trade  associations  have  raised  concerns  that  the  implementation  of
some  of  the  recommendations  will  be  expensive.  Which  of  the  recommendations
do you believe will be most costly? Would these costs be justified in terms of their
expected outcomes?

A5. More often than not, new code provisions have a cost associated with implemen-
tation.  Some  of  the  recommendations  will  likely  be  expensive.  Although  I  am  not
a  structural  engineer,  it  is  my  understanding  that  the  ‘‘progressive  collapse’’  rec-
ommendation  is  one  of  the  most  costly.  Although  that  may  be  the  case,  the  loss  in
terms  of  lives  of  another  progressive  collapse  like  the  WTC  disaster  or  the  recent
Madrid high-rise fire is totally unacceptable.
Q6. In  written  testimony  submitted  to  the  Committee,  the  American  Institute  of  Ar-
chitects  points  to  the  lack  of  a  fire  test  facility  in  United  States-a  facility  large
enough to test components of a tall building—as a major shortcoming in the Na-
tion’s  ability  to  improve  skyscraper  safety.  Is  the  maintenance  and  operation  of
large-scale  fire  testing  capability  a  NIST  responsibility,  or  does  it  lie  elsewhere
in  the  Federal  Government  or  the  private  sector?  How  do  you  respond  to  the
AIA’s comments?

A6. I  agree  that  a  test  facility  that  tests  all  components  as  a  group  (similar  to  a
facility  in  Great  Britain)  is  desperately  needed.  Then  current  ASTM  E–119  test
standard is not realistic and needs to be replaced. Unfortunately, there is no incen-
tive for the private sector to develop such an expensive facility. Despite the fact that
building safety is a local government function, it would be inappropriate and fiscally
impossible for cities and states to fund such a facility. It is only logical that the Fed-
eral  Government  assume  such  a  responsibility  and  locate  the  facility  within  NIST.
Q7. Testimony  submitted  to  the  Science  Committee  by  the  Building  Owners  and
Managers  Association  (BOMA)  calls  for  cost-benefit  analyses  to  be  developed  on
the  implementation  of  NIST’s  recommendations.  Do  you  believe  this  is  a  good
idea? Why or why not? If so, who should develop these analyses?

A7. The use of a cost-benefit analysis is not currently utilized (to any great extent)
when preparing the hundreds of codes and standards developed by the NFPA, ICC,
and other groups. While I agree that such a process could be desirable for all codes
and  standards,  I  do  not  believe  we  should  start  with  the  WTC  investigation.  The
use of a cost-benefit analysis must first be debated on a national level, ensuring that
the public (typically left out of the current code development process) has input into
the decision of what is ‘‘too costly.’’
Q8. Which  recommendations  do  you  think  most  require  action  by  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment, particularly with respect to research, and which agencies should be re-
sponsible?

A8. I  believe  that  my  response  to  Question  4  above  answers  this  question.  I  would
add,  however,  that  the  radio  communications  issue  is  one  of  great  importance  to
emergency  responders  and  crosses  over  several  lines  of  jurisdiction  within  the  Fed-
eral Government. An serious attempt must be made to take control of this issue and
move it forward to resolution.

Questions submitted by Democratic Members
Q1. What is your assessment of how well NIST has carried out its duties under the
National  Construction  Safety  Team  (NCST)  Act?  Do  you  feel  that  NIST  should
invoke  the  ACT  more  often,  for  example  should  NIST  have  invokes  the  Act  to
investigate  Hurricane  Katrina-related  infrastructure  failures?  Does  NIST  have
clear  criteria  for  when  it  should  invoke  the  National  Construction  Safety  Team
(NCST)  Act?  When  reading  the  comments  of  the  NCST  Advisory  Committee  I
have  the  impression  that  they  are  frustrated  that  NIST  is  not  doing  enough
under the authorities provided by the Act.

A1. I feel that NIST has not made a substantial effort to implement the NCST and
have shown little interest in it. While NIST has worked to develop response criteria
to  establish  when  teams  will  be  organized,  they  have  done  little  else.  For  example,
they  have  not  established  an  NCST  office  within  NIST  and  have  not  developed  a
detailed  investigation  protocol  manual  for  actual  investigations.  To  my  knowledge,
they  have  not  published  a  list  of  actual  potential  team  members  (including  individ-
uals from the private sector).

NIST  should  have  responded  to  the  Chicago  E2  nightclub  disaster  of  2003,  the
Florida  hurricanes  and  California  wildfires  of  2004,  and  most  certainly  hurricane
Katrina in 2005. These were all substantial incidents where the NCST should have
been deployed. All of them fall within their own ‘‘when to respond’’ criteria.

It  is  critical  that  NIST  respond  to  such  disasters,  and  they  use  the  NCST  to  do
it.  The  NCST  provides  two  critical  elements  not  contained  under  other  NIST  au-
thorities:  the  ability  to  investigate  without  having  to  have  local  officials  ask  NIST
to do it and requires NIST to prepare code recommendations.
Q2. Mr.  Corbett,  you  feel  that  NIST  took  to  long  to  complete  its  investigation.  What
do  you  think  would  have  been  a  more  reasonable  timeframe?  Why  do  you  think
it took so long to complete the investigation?

A2. NIST  frequently  moved  their  target  completion  dates  further  and  further  back
(the  World  Trade  Center  building  7  investigation  is  still  not  complete).  While  this
is  somewhat  understandable  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  investigation,  a  com-
pletion  target  of  two  and  a  half  years  would  have  been  more  reasonable.  From  my
perspective,  it  seems  that  it  took  too  long  to  get  out  of  the  starting  gate,  too  long
to get to the actual investigation initiated. It also seems to be due to legal problems
as  well.  For  example,  some  of  the  delay  in  the  evacuation  investigation  was  due  to
problems  in  obtaining  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  approval  for  the  oral  inter-
views.

Q3. Mr.  Corbett,  you  are  critical  of  the  NIST  recommendations  for  being  too  vague.
Would you give us some examples of where you see problems? What should have
been done differently?

A3. NIST  should  have  begun  developing  code  recommendations  months  ago.  The
fact that they are now only hiring the National Institute of Building Sciences to pre-
pare  them  is  inexcusable.  I  consistently  advocated  for  development  of  recommenda-
tions in ‘‘tight’’ code language well over a year ago. For example, NIST should have
easily  been  able  to  come  up  with  specific  language  for  increasing  minimum  high-
rise stairwell widths and providing secondary water supplies for sprinkler/standpipe
systems in acceptable code text.
Q4. Mr. Corbett, you believe that NIST was not assertive enough in its investigation
and  you  lay  the  blame  at  NIST  staff  attorneys.  How  should  have  NIST  been
more assertive? What leads you to believe it was bad counsel by staff attorneys?
A4. NIST legal staff should have exhibited a more ‘‘can-do’’ attitude to the WTC and
Station  Nightclub  investigations.  Instead  of  spending  time  identifying  all  the  road-
blocks  to  getting  information,  NIST  legal  staff  should  have  spent  more  time  estab-
lishing  ways  of  legally  getting  the  information  NIST  needed.  In  addition,  NIST
should  have  used  its  subpoena  power,  especially  in  the  case  of  the  Station  Night-
club. NIST relied almost exclusively on newspaper accounts of club survivors for its
‘‘investigation’’ rather than actual interviews—totally unacceptable.
Q5. Mr.  Corbett,  the  NIST  recommendations  are  just  the  first  step  in  the  process.
They  have  to  be  implemented  by  building  code  organizations  and  adopted  by
states and localities. How do you see the process moving forward? I understand
that  New  York  City  is  currently  revising  its  building  codes,  are  they  using  the
NIST report and recommendations in this process?

A5. The process will move forward ever so slowly. The model code groups and local
jurisdictions  (like  NYC)  need  tight  code  language  for  consideration,  not  material
that  they  have  to  further  refine.  The  model  code  development  process  itself  takes
a  long  time  as  does  the  adoption  process  by  local  governments.  The  fact  NIST  took
so  long  to  complete  the  investigation  (and  continues  to  in  the  case  of  WTC  7)  only
extends  this  timeline.  The  National  Air  Disaster  Alliance  has  said:  ‘‘safety  delayed
is  safety  denied.’’  I  think  this  statement  is  appropriate  in  the  case  of  the  NCST
WTC investigation.

Responses by Henry L. Green, President, International Code Council

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by the Majority
Q1. When is your committee that is prioritizing the NIST recommendations going to
complete  its  work?  Will  that  committee  then  be  putting  any  of  the  recommenda-
tions into play for the upcoming ICC review process? How is it determining pri-
orities?

A1. The  ICC  has  two  committees  at  work  on  NIST/WTC  related  issues,  the  ad-hoc
committee on Terror Resistant Buildings (TRB) and the permanent Code Technology
Committee (CTC). These committees met together in early December to continue co-
ordination  of  activities  in  advance  of  the  March  24,  2006  deadline  for  submission
of  code  change  proposals  for  the  2007  supplements  to  the  2006  editions  of  the  I–
Codes.  Each  of  the  two  committees  will  continue  the  process  of  preparing  inde-
pendent  proposals  based  on  each  committee’s  unique  charter  and  in  review  of  the
NIST/WTC  recommendations.  In  early  February  the  CTC  will  meet  to  formally  re-
ceive  the  recommendations  of  the  TRB,  and  has  scheduled  to  issue  a  report  on  the
consolidated  work  of  the  two  committees  in  advance  of  the  March  24  deadline.  As
is addressed more fully in responses to questions below, some of the NIST/WTC rec-
ommendations  require  preparation  of  additional  technological  and  economic  assess-
ments.  In  immediate  prioritization  the  committees  are  focused  on  those  measures
for which documented supporting evidence is available by the March 24, 2006 dead-
line for the next code cycle.
Q2. In her testimony, Ms. McNabb said that the recommendation related to elevators
may  be  one  of  the  most  important.  Do  you  agree?  How  difficult  would  that  be
to  codify  and  implement?  Can  you  give  the  Committee  a  sense  of  what  specific
next steps you would take to evaluate that recommendation and what additional
information you would need and from whom?

A2. Full  exploration  of  the  technological  feasibility  and  costs  and  benefits  of  this
recommendation  are  a  priority.  At  this  time,  however,  it  should  be  observed  that
it  appears  unlikely  that  cost/benefit  findings  based  on  this  recommendation  will  be
available in advance of the deadline for the next code development cycle. At present
the  CTC  awaits  reporting  from  the  American  Society  of  Mechanical  Engineers
(ASME)  regarding  the  technological  and  economic  issues  associated  with  this  rec-
ommendation.  Upon  availability  of  findings  from  ASME,  ICC’s  CTC  will  be  able  to
issue advice regarding the potential timing of a code change proposal related to the
use of elevators in occupant evacuation and emergency response access.
Q3. In  your  testimony,  you  suggested  that  codes  are  not  necessarily  the  best  way  to
promote  changes  in  practice.  What  is  the  problem  with  using  codes?  What  are
the  alternatives?  What  NIST  recommendations  should  be  implemented  through
means other than codes?

A3. My  view  in  this  respect  is  this,  that  the  quality  and  value  of  building  codes  is
meaningless  unless  the  enactment  of  these  codes  is  followed  up  by  local  and  State
code  officials  with  the  proper  training,  equipment  and  action  by  these  officials.
Building  codes,  as  uniformly  enforced,  both  ensure  the  public  of  an  adequate  min-
imum  standard  of  safety  in  any  building  they  or  their  family  may  visit,  and  also
provide  a  level  economic  playing  field  for  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  our
personal and public facilities.

As I closed my testimony before the Committee, I share the emphasis of the NIST/

WTC report on recommendations on building regulations:

Rigorous  enforcement  of  building  codes  and  standards  by  State  and  local  agen-
cies,  well  trained  and  managed,  is  critical  in  order  for  standards  and  codes  to
ensure  the  expected  level  of  safety.  Unless  they  are  complied  with,  the  best
codes  and  standards  cannot  protect  occupants,  emergency  responders,  or  build-
ings. NIST NCSTAR 1, Section 9.1, p. 202

Q4. How  did  the  ICC  determine  that  a  three-hour  fire  rating  was  appropriate  in

light of the NIST recommendations?

A4. The increase of the fire rating on structural systems for buildings greater than
420  feet  in  height  was  adopted  in  final  form  by  ICC’s  membership  at  its  final  code
action hearings held in September 2003, and first became a requirement in the 2004
Supplement  to  the  2003  International  Building  Code.  This  action  was  taken  in  the
early  stages  of  the  NIST/WTC  review,  well  before  issuance  of  recommendations.

This  significant  change  in  the  fire  rating  of  structural  systems  of  high-rise  struc-
tures  was  made  with  the  understanding  that  it  will  impose  considerable  additional
expenses  to  the  construction  of  new  high-rise  buildings.  In  my  view  this  change  is
not a product of new scientific understanding; it is a result of our society’s profound
new realization of the attractiveness of such structures to terrorist attack.
Q5. You say that recommendations related to specific products will have trouble get-

ting through. Have any been made?

A5. That observation I shared from generalized experience with ICC’s code process,
but I am not aware of any WTC event inspired code change proposals related to spe-
cific  products.  It  should  be  noted  that  because  the  NIST/WTC  final  report  was
issued  well  after  the  August  2004  deadline  for  code  change  proposals  in  the  cycle
just completed, we have not yet received or acted upon code change proposals based
on the issuance of the final NIST/WTC report.
Q6. You testified that we need more data and research to implement some of NIST’s
recommendations.  What  are  the  top  three  priority  areas  where  additional  re-
search  and  data  are  needed?  Which  specific  entities  should  be  doing  this  re-
search? Which recommendations are most hampered by lack of data?

A6. In  my  view  the  top  three  areas  of  need  for  scientific  research  relative  to  code
regulations in conjunction with the recommendations of the NIST report are:

1) A  comprehensive  scientific  analysis  of  egress,  fire  ratings  and  fire  proofing

for high-rise structures.

2) Specific technical and cost/benefit analysis, in conjunction with ASTM Inter-
national,  of  the  serviceability  of  elevator  systems  for  fire  event  occupant
egress and fire services access for high-rise buildings.

3) Specific  scientific  investigation,  in  conjunction  with  the  American  Society  of
Civil  Engineers,  of  the  cost  and  benefit  of  enhanced  structural  provisions
necessary to address structural stability and progressive collapse.

Those  questions  most  hampered  by  lack  of  data  relate  to  fire  event  egress;  espe-
cially  the  technological  potential  and  the  cost/benefit  calculations  of  developing  ele-
vator  systems  designed  to  operate  during  fire  evacuation  and  fire  suppression
events.
Q7. Building  trade  associations  have  raised  concerns  that  the  implementation  of
some  of  the  recommendations  will  be  expensive.  Which  of  the  recommendations
do you believe will be most costly? Would these costs be justified in terms of their
expected outcomes?

A7. It  is  clear  that  implementation  of  many  of  the  recommendations  would  signifi-
cantly  increase  the  cost  of  construction  and  operation  of  new  buildings,  as  well  as
reduce the percentage of leasable space in new construction. It seems that the most
expensive  of  the  recommendations  relate  to  enhanced  egress  measures,  especially
provisions  for  refuge  floors  and  the  construction  and  operation  of  elevator  systems
that  could  be  relied  upon  for  occupant  egress  and  fire  services  access  during  fire
events.  Considerable  additional  construction  costs  would  also  come  with  providing
secondary  water  systems  for  fire  suppression  and  the  additional  complexity  of  con-
structing enhanced structural systems to mitigate potential for progressive collapse.
Without new data presenting technical feasibility and cost/benefit analysis, it is not
possible  to  suggest  the  likely  outcome  of  a  code  change  recommendation  based  on
any of these measures.
Q8. In  written  testimony  submitted  to  the  Committee,  the  American  Institute  of  Ar-
chitects  points  to  the  lack  of  a  fire  test  facility  in  the  United  States—a  facility
large  enough  to  test  components  of  a  tall  building—as  a  major  shortcoming  in
the  Nation’s  ability  to  improve  skyscraper  safety.  Is  the  maintenance  and  oper-
ation  of  large-scale  fire  testing  capability  a  NIST  responsibility,  or  does  it  lie
elsewhere in the Federal Government or the private sector? How do you respond
to the AIA’s comments?

A8. It is important to observe, in context of this question, that the NIST report con-
veys a clear understanding that the structural failures of Tower 1 and Tower 2 were
a result of the profoundly unique and unprecedented conditions associated with ter-
rorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In this respect the NIST report (page xli) sum-
marizes:

The tragic consequences of the September 11, 2001 attacks were directly attrib-
utable  to  the  fact  that  terrorists  flew  large  jet-fuel  laden  commercial  airliners
into  the  WTC  towers.  Buildings  for  use  by  the  general  population  are  not  de-

signed to withstand attacks of such severity; building regulations do not require
building designs to consider aircraft impact. In our cities, there has been no ex-
perience  with  a  disaster  of  such  magnitude,  nor  has  there  been  any  in  which
the  total  collapse  of  a  high-rise  building  occurred  so  rapidly  and  with  little
warning.

The AIA states in its testimony that:

The NIST report and recommendations raise powerful issues about how best to
achieve building safety and security. The AIA encourages NIST to further inves-
tigate  areas  such  as  actual  building  occupant  loads  and  develop  data  on  actual
building performance through additional testing of full-sized components. NIST
provides  an  ideal  platform  to  investigate  and  report  fairly  these  issues.  How-
ever, it will be necessary to gather much more data to verify any change in the
direction of model building codes. The AIA continues to believe that the best way
to ensure that building codes protect the public is to ensure that model codes are
developed through an open consensus based process. (AIA testimony, page 7)

The  ICC  concurs  with  the  AIA  that  any  NIST  recommendation  that  leads  to  a
code  change  proposal  should  be  considered  through  a  voluntary  consensus  based
code and standards process and be accompanied with data from a thorough scientific
evaluation  of  the  change  in  materials,  technology,  building  design  or  fire-resistance
testing and rating processes that are proposed. In assessing questions regarding the
responsibility  for  and  the  value  of  increased  scaling  of  fire-testing,  as  well  as  the
capacity of present public and private sector testing facilities to do such, it is imper-
ative  to  frame  the  NIST  recommendations  as  specific  proposals  for  change  to
present  codes  and  standards.  At  this  writing  the  ICC  is  in  receipt  of  a  concept,  or
‘‘Strawman’’  proposal  prepared  by  NIST  which  suggests  additional  consideration  of
scaling  on  fire  resistance  standards  when  test  specimens  are  less  than  c  actual
scale. In conducting real fire testing for the WTC examination NIST found that the
largest facility in North America provided testing up to 30 feet; one-half of the size
that  would  have  been  necessary  for  full-scale  testing.  NIST  has  observed  that,
worldwide,  there  may  be  only  one  or  two  facilities  with  furnaces  capable  of  testing
connected structural elements, at designed load, with up to 60 foot spans. Given our
present  understanding  of  the  unique  character  of  the  conditions  under  which  such
full-scale testing would enhance the safety of high-rise buildings it may, as the AIA
suggests,  be  incumbent  on  the  Federal  Government  to  undertake  to  construct  and
operate such a unique facility.
Q9. Testimony  submitted  to  the  Science  Committee  by  the  Building  Owners  and
Managers  Association  (BOMA)  calls  for  cost-benefit  analyses  to  be  developed  on
the  implementation  of  NIST’s  recommendations.  Do  you  believe  this  is  a  good
idea? Why or why not? If so, who should develop these analyses?

A9. As  a  first  measure  the  public  safety  benefit  of  any  recommendation  must  be
clearly  evidenced  and  supported,  and  the  ICC  welcomes  the  results  of  the  NIST/
WTC report as significant science in the consideration of improving the defensibility
of our public structures. At the same time it is necessary, in putting forward build-
ing  code  changes  based  on  those  recommendations,  to  clearly  understand  the  eco-
nomic consequences of each specific proposal. It is ICC’s view that NIST, along with
all federal agencies with responsibilities impacting the built environment, should be
active  participants  in  offering  building  code  amendment  proposals,  whether  based
on the NIST/WTC report, or through the general course of involvement in operating
in or regulating the built environment. As with any code change participant or advo-
cate,  this  includes  participation  in  the  development  of  both  the  scientific  evidence
supporting  a  change,  and  analyses  of  the  economic  cost  and  public  policy  justifica-
tion for the change.
Q10. Which  recommendations  do  you  think  most  require  action  by  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment,  particularly  with  respect  to  research,  and  which  agencies  should  be
responsible?

A10. As suggested in my testimony to the Committee, and my observations regard-
ing  other  follow-up  questions,  the  ICC  believes  that  federal  agency  involvement  in
ICC’s Governmental Consensus process is critical in providing a full range of inter-
ests in the proposal of code change recommendations, and in providing scientific and
economic  evidence  that  allows  for  a  fully  considered  debate  on  those  recommenda-
tions. In this manner the federal agency representatives participate, consistent with
federal  policy  guidance  in  OMB  A–119  and  the  NTTAA,  as  colleagues  in  the  vol-
untary  sector  model  code  development  and  amendment  process.  This  participation
should reach as well to all standards developing organizations (SDOs) that maintain

standards  which  have  been  identified  by  NIST  as  addressed  by  the  NIST/WTC  re-
port. These developers include the American Concrete Institute, the American Insti-
tute of Architects, the American Institute of Steel Construction, the American Soci-
ety of Civil Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, The Associa-
tion of the Wall and Ceiling Industry, ASTM International, the International Orga-
nization  for  Standardization,  the  National  Fire  Protection  Association,  and  Under-
writers  Laboratories.  The  work  of  each  of  these  SDOs  is,  as  well,  referenced  in  the
International  Codes.  This  being  said,  recommendations  22,  23  and  24  of  group  6
‘‘Improved  Emergency  Response’’  have  direct  and  unique  impact  on  the  regulatory
responsibilities  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  Federal  Commu-
nications Commission, and would require consideration in federal rule-making proc-
esses.

Questions submitted by Democratic Members
Q1. Mr. Green, the ICC recommends closer collaboration between Federal, State and

local governments on building code issues. What needs to be improved?

A1. Consistent  with  the  spirit  and  purpose  of  OMB  Circular  A–119  and  the  Na-
tional  Technology  and  Transfer  Act  of  1995,  U.S.  federal  agencies  need  not  only  to
look  to  the  private  sector  for  standards  to  utilize  in  governmental  application,  but
also  to  participate  in  these  standards  development  processes.  Federal  Government
agencies  do  have  a  history  of  participation  in  the  Governmental  Consensus  Process
utilized by ICC. That participation should continue to grow along with the agencies’
growing  reliance  on  ICC’s  model  building  codes  both  to  guide  federal  agency  con-
struction, as well as in facilitation of federal rule-makings. Together with expanded
participation  in  proposing  and  advocating  independent  amendments  to  the  model
codes,  the  agencies  should  actively  coordinate  the  federal  perspective  on  code
changes that will be considered in ICC’s code development process, regardless of the
source of the proposal.
Q2. The  ICC  agrees  with  NIST’s  recommendations  for  continuing  education  for
building industry professionals. Currently what professional development activi-
ties  does  ICC  sponsor?  What  new  activities  do  you  envision  being  developed  in
cooperation with NIST and other federal agencies?

A2. Below is ICC’s published training schedule for the coming year. These programs
are  routinely  attended  by  local,  State  and  federal  officials  with  responsibilities  in
facilities construction or in regulating the building environment.

Beyond  putting  forward  these  professional  training  programs  conducted  by  ICC’s
training professionals, and assistance to agencies directly utilizing I–Codes in facili-
ties  construction,  ICC’s  on-going  work  with  NIST  and  other  federal  agencies  in-
cludes  policy  development  coordination  with  ICC’s  Federal  Government  relations
staff.

A short list of ICC’s collaborative work includes initiatives with the Departments
of  Justice  and  Housing  and  Urban  Development  in  addressing  elimination  of  bar-
riers to building access and egress, and providing HUD’s Partnership for Advancing
Technology  in  Housing  (PATH)  with  technical  support  on  building  regulations.  ICC
initiatives  with  the  Department  of  Commerce  include  work  with  the  International
Trade Administration in hosting foreign delegations researching U.S. standards, and
similarly  with  NIST’s  Office  of  Standards  Services.  ICC  is  working  with  the  U.S.
Chemical Safety Board in dissemination of results from investigations of dust explo-
sions, and in presentation of CBC findings to codes and standards amendment proc-
esses.  Collaboration  with  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  includes
work with the Centers for Disease Control on a program related to CDC’s objective
of elimination of residential fire deaths by 2020.

Q3. Mr. Green, I understand that your organization just included a general meeting.

What were the general reactions to the NIST report by your membership?

A3. It  should  be  noted  that  the  main  focus  of  ICC’s  meeting  in  Detroit  in  Sep-
tember, 2005 was the final action hearings on code change proposals that were sub-
mitted in August 2004—well before the release of either the draft or final NIST re-
ports. As such no review of the report was undertaken by the body at-large. I would
observe,  however,  that  the  membership  welcomes  the  NIST/WTC  report  and  recog-
nizes  that  some  of  its  most  significant  recommendations,  such  as  those  addressed
in  my  responses  to  the  other  questions  from  the  committee,  will  require  additional
review, evaluation and findings from standards developers in order to have complete
information on technological feasibility and in order to fully evaluate the cost/benefit
balance of specific proposals. As I discussed in my testimony, affirmative action was
taken  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  directing  the  ICC  Code  Technology  Committee
to work with NIST and parties in order to prioritize the recommendations and pre-
pare  specific  code  change  proposals  in  advance  of  the  March  24,  2006  deadline  for
submission to our next 18 month code change cycle.
Q4. Mr. Green, why do you feel that without NIST involvement and leadership that
either  nothing  will  be  done  to  implement  their  recommendations  or  that  they
may be misinterpreted?

A4. It is my view that NIST has and continues to carry forward its responsibilities
effectively.  NIST  will  have  a  critical  role  in  elaborating  the  intent  and  substan-
tiation  of  its  WTC  recommendations  during  discussion  of  code  change  proposals
stimulated  by  the  WTC  report.  NIST’s  role  will  be  crucial  in  ensuring  that  ICC’s
technical committees and the membership at-large receive a full and accurate inter-
pretation  and  basis  for  the  NIST  recommendations.  With  the  public  circulation  of
the  NIST/WTC  report,  we  do  expect  that  a  number  of  additional  interested  and  af-
fected  parties  will  use  the  report  as  the  foundation  for  specific  code  changes  pro-
posals. To further stimulate this process NIST has already demonstrated leadership
through the issuance, in late November, of a set of ‘‘Strawman’’ model building code
change  proposals  which  present  the  NIST/WTC  recommendations  in  a  manner  con-
sistent with submissions for actual code change proposals. The Strawman document
is  already  being  evaluated  by  ICC’s  TRB  and  CTC  committees  in  preparation  of
their  report  on  the  development  of  code  change  proposals  based  on  the  NIST/WTC
report.

STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS

The  American  Institute  of  Architects  is  pleased  to  provide  written  testimony  for
the House Science Committee’s hearing on ‘‘NIST’s Investigation of the World Trade
Center Collapse.’’

The AIA represents more than 76,000 licensed architects, emerging professionals,
and  allied  partners  who  are  fully  committed  to  the  highest  professional  standards
in  the  design  of  the  Nation’s  built  environment.  As  the  AIA’s  public  policies  state,
‘‘Architecture profoundly affects people. The work of architects is essential to human
well being, and architects must embrace their ethical obligation to uphold this pub-
lic trust.’’

This  testimony  is  based  on  the  AIA’s  public  comments  on  NIST’s  Final  Report  of
the  National  Construction  Safety  Team  on  the  Collapses  of  the  World  Trade  Center
Towers.  When  NIST  released  its  report  last  June,  the  AIA  invited  its  members  to
provide  input  to  the  Institute  about  the  draft  report  and  recommendations.  These
comments reflect the views expressed by the AIA’s members.

The  AIA  cannot  overstate  the  accomplishments  of  the  NIST  investigating  team
and  the  substantial  body  of  information  they  gathered  and  organized  in  response
to  one  of  the  worst  catastrophes  in  American  history.  The  results  are  a  definitive
historical record of the largest and most devastating building disaster ever. The AIA
was  honored  to  participate  in  this  process  by  having  one  of  its  members  serve  on
the National Construction Safety Team Advisory Committee.

Recognizing the superior design and performance of the twin towers during an un-
precedented  terrorist  attack,  the  data  that  the  investigating  team  compiled  should
not  only  help  identify  deficiencies  but  also  serve  as  a  testament  to  the  buildings’
ability  to  stand  long  enough  after  the  attack  to  allow  thousands  of  occupants  to
evacuate.

We owe it to the victims of the September 11 attacks, and to the millions of Amer-
icans who use buildings every day, to ensure that our built environment is safe, and
that any changes to how we design and construct buildings come about as the result
of an open, deliberative and rational building code and regulation development proc-
ess.
The Investigation: Demonstrating the Robustness of the Towers

On  September  11,  2001,  the  World  Trade  Center  towers  were  subjected  to  an  al-
most unimaginable attack from hijacked, fuel-laden 767s flying at such high speeds
that  one  of  the  jets  nearly  broke  apart  in  mid-air.  Following  its  Congressional  au-
thorization to investigate the circumstances that contributed to the towers’ collapse,
NIST  lauds  the  success  of  the  design,  construction  and  materials  for  their  excep-
tional performance. The report finds that the buildings would have survived the cat-
astrophic  event  were  it  not  for  the  fact  that  the  aircraft  caused  extensive  damage
to  the  buildings  and  their  fire  protective  systems  (both  passive  and  active),  and  ig-
nited  extensive  fires  that  were  limited  only  by  the  amount  of  combustible  material
they could reach.

The  report  presents,  in  its  Executive  Summary,  the  following  findings  regarding

the design, construction and materials of the towers:
1. . . .the  towers  withstood  the  impacts  and  would  have  remained  standing  were
it  not  for  the  dislodged  insulation  (fireproofing)  and  the  subsequent  multi-floor
fires. The robustness of the perimeter frame-tube system and the large size of the
buildings  helped  the  towers  withstand  the  impact.  The  structural  system  redis-
tributed  loads  without  collapsing  in  places  of  aircraft  impact,  avoiding  larger
scale damage upon impact.

2. The  WTC  towers  likely  would  not  have  collapsed  under  the  combined  effects  of
aircraft impact damage and the extensive, multi-floor fires if the thermal insula-
tion had not been widely dislodged or had been only minimally dislodged by air-
craft impact.

3. Since the flow of people from the building had slowed considerably 20 min. [sic]
before the tower [WTC 1] collapsed, the stairwell capacity was adequate to evac-
uate the occupants on that morning.

4. As in WTC 1, shortly before collapse, the flow of people from the building [WTC
2]  had  slowed  considerably,  indicating  that  the  stairwell  capacity  was  adequate
that morning.

5. The fire safety systems (sprinklers, smoke purge, and fire alarms,) were designed

to meet or exceed current practice.

6. For  the  approximately  1,000  emergency  responders  on  the  scene,  this  was  the
largest disaster they had even seen. Despite attempts by the responding agencies

139

to work together and perform their own tasks, the extent of the incident was well
beyond their capabilities.

7. . . .the  actual  design  and  approval  process  produced  two  buildings  that  gen-
erally  were  consistent  with  nearly  all  of  the  provisions  of  the  New  York  City
Building  Code  and  other  building  codes  of  the  time.  The  loads  for  which  the
buildings were designed exceeded the code requirements. The quality of the struc-
tural  steels  was  consistent  with  the  building  specifications.  The  departures  from
the building codes and standards did not have a significant effect on the outcome
of September 11.

8. On  September  11,  2001,  the  minimum  specified  thickness  of  the  insulation  was
adequate  to  delay  heating  of  the  trusses;  the  amount  of  insulation  dislodged  by
the  aircraft  impact,  however,  was  sufficient  to  cause  the  structural  steel  to  be
heated to critical levels.

9. . . .in  all  cases  [during  NIST’s  testing  of  fire  rated  assemblies],  the  floors  con-

tinued to support the full design load without collapse for over two hours.

10. The  wind  loads  used  for  the  WTC  towers,  which  governed  the  structural  design
of  the  external  columns  and  provided  the  baseline  capacity  of  the  structures  to
withstand  abnormal  events  such  as  major  fires  or  impact  damage,  significantly
exceeded the requirements of the New York City Building Code and selected other
building codes of the day.

The  North  Tower.  The  first  account  of  the  performance  of  World  Trade  Center  1
(the  north  tower)  is  found  in  Chapter  2  of  NIST’s  final  report.  Following  a  detailed
description  of  the  extent  of  damage,  the  report  states,  ‘‘Even  with  all  this  damage,
the building still stood.’’ Ignition of the building contents by the explosion of 10,000
gallons  of  jet  fuel  is  addressed  in  the  account  of  WTC  1,  which  finds  that  the  igni-
tion  of  the  contents  of  the  building  and  airplane  caused  a  fuel-controlled  fire,  cre-
ating  an  exposure  that  is  not  typical  of  any  condition  that  is  considered  when  de-
signing buildings.

The  report  finds  that  the  aircraft  impact  virtually  destroyed  the  fire  protection
systems.  The  report  states  that  the  system  was  designed  to  supply  water  to  about
eight  sprinkler  heads  at  one  time,  enough  to  control  the  flames  from  as  much  as
1,500 square feet of burning material. The water supply was likely sufficient to con-
trol  fires  up  to  triple  that  size.  However,  the  fires  caused  by  the  aircraft  impact
were far larger than those envisioned by any imaginable fire protection system.
The  South  Tower.  World  Trade  Center  2  (the  south  tower)  was  subjected  to  a
similar  event,  but  faced  a  number  of  factors  that  were  distinct  from  WTC  1.  Those
factors  resulted  in  a  larger  overall  fraction  of  the  occupants  surviving,  despite  the
fact that WTC 2 collapsed in a shorter period of time. According to the report, with-
in  five  minutes  of  the  impact  on  WTC  1,  half  of  the  occupants  of  WTC  2  had  left
their  floors,  and  the  number  of  evacuees  subsequently  increased  rapidly.  Based  on
their  perception  of  events  occurring  in  WTC  1,  approximately  3,000  people  in  WTC
2 escaped in the 16 minutes between the aircraft impact on WTC 1 and the impact
on WTC 2.

The  report  goes  on  to  state  that  WTC  2  ‘‘swayed  more  than  one  foot  back  and
forth in each direction on the impact floors, about one-third the sway under the high
winds  for  which  the  building  was  designed.’’  Nonetheless,  just  like  WTC  1,  WTC  2
absorbed  the  aircraft  strike  and  remained  standing  for  nearly  an  hour.  Similar  to
the  circumstances  of  WTC  1,  jet  fuel  played  a  critical  role  in  providing  an  extraor-
dinary ignition source to the fuel load in WTC 2, contributing to the ultimate failure
of the structural system.

The  World  Trade  Center  collapse  provided  the  design  and  construction  industry
with  an  opportunity  to  evaluate  and  reexamine  its  processes  and  practices.  Based
upon the outstanding success of these buildings under extraordinary circumstances,
it is clear that the design community can be trusted to create redundancies for typ-
ical  building  emergency  situations,  that  codes  are  developed  in  a  manner  that  pro-
vides  sufficient  input  from  all  quarters  to  ensure  adequate  life  safety  for  typical
emergency  situations,  and  that  no  upgrading  of  code  requirements  is  warranted
given the performance of these buildings.
The Recommendations: Missed Opportunities

Although the report provides significant information regarding the performance of
the buildings, their occupants and the extraordinary efforts of the responding emer-
gency personnel, the AIA believes that a number of the recommendations in the re-
port are not supported by the findings of the investigation. Other recommendations
suggest  reforms  that  have  already  been  addressed  by  the  design  and  construction

industry  or  the  model  code  organizations.  The  Appendix  to  this  testimony  provides
a detailed analysis of NIST’s recommendations and the AIA’s responses.

At  the  same  time,  the  AIA  believes  that  the  report  misses  opportunities  to  make
recommendations  that  would  improve  the  understanding  of  how  buildings  perform
in extreme events. Developing that understanding in order to protect building occu-
pants must be a fundamental mission of all organizations that work to create a bet-
ter built environment.

One  such  area  is  fire  testing.  NIST  developed  advanced  fire  modeling  techniques
to  evaluate  the  complex  circumstances  at  the  World  Trade  Center,  examining  the
spread of fire and its impact on structural members. This may become an important
tool  for  designing  safer  buildings,  although  their  ability  to  integrate  known  condi-
tions into the modeling currently used in the marketplace was a major problem even
for  NIST  when  it  evaluated  the  2003  fire  at  the  Station  nightclub  in  Rhode  Island.
The AIA believes that improved fire testing is a vital need, and opportunity, that
must  not  be  ignored.  The  Institute  is  therefore  troubled  by  the  fact  that  there  are
no  test  facilities  in  the  United  States  that  can  accommodate  the  larger  lengths  or
sizes of elements such as those found in the twin towers. If the Federal Government
is truly committed to understanding the effects of such fire hazards on the built en-
vironment, it is critical that it provide for adequate testing facilities at home.

The  AIA  strongly  encourages  this  committee  to  consider  authorizing  funding  to
construct  new  testing  facilities  or  retrofit  existing  facilities  that  can  address  the  full
range of building conditions present in the United States.

In  addition,  NIST  should  be  encouraged  to  take  advantage  of  its  position  as  the
preeminent  research  facility  in  the  United  States  to  examine  innovative  materials
and processes and assure that they meet the most rigorous of standards appropriate
for their use. Performance codes, which the AIA believes are the future direction for
building  codes  and  regulations,  are  sorely  in  need  of  supporting  information  on  the
actual  performance  of  buildings  and  building  systems.  Without  this  data,  designers
are left to make assumptions based on limited resources.

Furthermore,  the  AIA  believes  that  NIST  should  facilitate  opportunities  to  de-
velop  ‘‘smart’’  building  systems  that  would  better  advise  first  responders  of  actual
building  conditions  and  situations.  The  current  efforts  to  improve  the  use  of  ele-
vators in an emergency are an example of the dramatic changes that will take place
to the guidance provided to building occupants.
Building Codes: An Accountable and Comprehensive System

The  major  finding  of  the  NIST  report  is  that  the  design  and  construction  mate-
rials  of  the  World  Trade  Center  did  not  contribute  to  the  disaster;  they  performed
exceptionally well. Despite this fact, the report offers several recommendations that
are not supported by the investigation, nor are they backed by substantive research.
In fact, the premises of some of the statements appear to be in error.

For example, in section 9.1 (‘‘Building Standards and Codes: Who is in Charge?’’),
the  report  states,  ‘‘Very  few  members  of  the  general  public  and  building  occupants
participate  in  [the  code  development]  process.’’  Although  this  is  true  of  most  stand-
ards  development  groups,  including  NFPA  and  IAPMO,  it  is  not  true  for  the  Inter-
national  Code  Council’s  family  of  codes.  State  and  local  code  enforcement  officials
(building, fire, plumbing, electrical, etc.) are a driving force behind code changes and
have  the  controlling  votes  on  all  changes  to  ICC’s  codes.  These  officials  are  public
officials  who  represent  their  states,  counties  and  cities,  and  do  not  fall  within  any
of  the  categories  that  NIST  lists  as  ‘‘influencing  the  practices  used  in  the  design,
construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings in the United States.’’

The code enforcement community has been extraordinarily aggressive in pursuing
education  and  certification  for  their  members.  Many  states  and  local  jurisdictions
have  worked  diligently  to  assure  the  credibility  of  their  enforcement  programs  by
requiring certification of training obtained by their code enforcement officials.

The  question  of  ‘‘who  is  in  charge’’  regarding  the  development  and  application  of
codes and standards is well established and recognized by 45 states as the code offi-
cial  using  the  International  Building  Code,  and  in  36  states  as  the  code  official
using the International Fire Code.

The AIA believes that State and local governments must retain the authority to de-
termine  appropriate  building  regulations.  The  AIA  does  not  agree  that  the  Federal
Government  is  in  a  position  to  supplant  the  voice  or  the  rights  of  local  and  state
jurisdictions  by  presuming  to  speak  for  the  public  that  is  given  the  constitutional
authority through police powers to determine what is appropriate for building regu-
lation in their communities.

The fundamental challenge regarding codes and life safety today is the lack of an
understanding or an appreciation by users of the safety features designed and built
into  modern  buildings.  This  includes  building  owners,  managers,  tenants  and  serv-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:09 Mar 20, 2006 Jkt 024133 PO 00000 Frm 00144 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\102605\24133 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

141

ice providers who often unintentionally subvert life safety features out of ignorance
about how they work. This was most evident in the Rhode Island nightclub tragedy,
where  modifications  that  were  made  to  the  interior  of  the  building  and  the  use  of
pyrophoric  materials  in  the  facility  were  both  major  violations  of  the  applicable
codes.  Had  the  owner  or  the  user  of  the  space  been  more  knowledgeable  about  the
potential hazards associated with such actions, that disaster would likely have been
averted.
Conclusion

NIST  has  undertaken  an  extraordinary  effort  to  investigate  and  understand  the
consequences  of  the  most  devastating  terrorist  attack  in  our  nation’s  history.  It
should  be  reassuring  to  the  public  that  the  report  concludes  that  the  World  Trade
Center towers were well within the contemporary norms of design and construction,
and that the buildings were able to stand long enough to allow thousands of people
to escape.

But  the  terrible  loss  of  life  that  day  demands  that  we  study  the  results  of  this
investigation  closely  to  learn  what  the  design  and  construction  professions  have
done right, and where improvements can be made to better protect people in build-
ings.

The recommendations in the NIST report are useful guidelines towards that end.
However,  the  AIA  believes  that  at  times  the  recommendations  overlook  measures
and  technologies  that  are  already  in  practice,  or  go  in  directions  that  are  not  sup-
ported by either the investigation or scientific research.

The  need  to  protect  the  health,  safety  and  welfare  of  people  who  use  buildings
is  not  a  subject  of  debate.  This  is  why  the  AIA  requires  its  members  to  adhere  to
the  highest  professional  standards  and  take  at  least  eight  hours  of  health,  safety
and  welfare  continuing  education  classes  each  and  every  year  throughout  their  ca-
reers in order to remain members in good standing.

The  NIST  report  and  recommendations  raise  powerful  issues  about  how  best  to
achieve  building  safety  and  security.  The  AIA  encourages  NIST  to  further  inves-
tigate  areas  such  as  actual  building  occupant  loads  and  develop  data  on  actual
building performance through additional testing of full-sized components. NIST pro-
vides an ideal platform to investigate and report fairly these issues. However, it will
be  necessary  to  gather  much  more  data  to  verify  any  change  in  the  direction  of
model  building  codes.  The  AIA  continues  to  believe  that  the  best  way  to  ensure  that
building codes protect the public is to ensure that model codes are developed through
an open, consensus based process.

The AIA commends NIST for making education a focus of its efforts. The AIA en-
courages the design and construction industry, and everyone who uses buildings, to
take  advantage  of  opportunities  to  gain  a  greater  understanding  of  how  buildings
affect our lives and our communities.

Appendix: Recommendations and Responses

The report states that NIST’s recommendations (Section 9.2) are based on:

1. Findings  related  to  building  performance,  evacuation  and  emergency  response,
and  to  procedures  and  practices  used  in  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and
maintenance of the buildings;

2. Whether  these  findings  relate  to  the  unique  circumstances  surrounding  the  ter-
rorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or to normal building and fire safety consid-
erations (including evacuation and emergency response);

3. Technical solutions that are needed to address potential risks to buildings, occu-
pants,  and  emergency  responders,  considering  both  identifiable  hazards  and  the
consequences of those hazards; and

4. Whether  the  risks  apply  to  all  buildings  or  are  limited  to  certain  building  types
(e.g., buildings that exceed a certain height and floor area or that employ a spe-
cific  type  of  structural  system),  buildings  that  contain  specific  design  features,
iconic/signature buildings, or buildings that house critical functions.
NIST’s recommendations are broken down into eight groups. The AIA’s comments

follow each recommendation.
Group 1: Increased Structural Integrity

Group  1  (Increased  Structural  Integrity)  calls  for  improved  standards  to  enhance

structural integrity for estimating load effects of progressive collapse and wind.
Recommendation 1. NIST recommends that: (1) progressive collapse should be pre-
vented  in  buildings  through  the  development  and  nationwide  adoption  of  consensus
standards  and  code  provisions,  along  with  the  tools  and  guidelines  needed  for  their
use  in  practice;  and  (2)  a  standard  methodology  should  be  developed—supported  by
analytical  design  tools  and  practical  design  guidance—to  reliably  predict  the  poten-
tial for complex failures in structural systems subjected to multiple hazards.
Recommendation  2.  NIST  recommends  that  nationally  accepted  performance
standards be developed for: (1) conducting wind tunnel testing of prototype structures
based  on  sound  technical  methods  that  result  in  repeatable  and  reproducible  results
among  testing  laboratories;  and  (2)  estimating  wind  loads  and  their  effects  on  tall
buildings for use in design, based on wind tunnel testing data and directional wind
speed data.
Recommendation 3. NIST recommends that an appropriate criterion should be de-
veloped  and  implemented  to  enhance  the  performance  of  tall  buildings  by  limiting
how  much  they  sway  under  lateral  load  design  conditions  (e.g.,  winds  and  earth-
quakes).
AIA Response

It  should  be  noted  that  nothing  in  the  NIST  report  criticizes  nor  questions  the
structural integrity of the World Trade Center towers and their design. In fact, the
report finds that the buildings were more robust than would have been required by
any code in force at the time they were designed and constructed. NIST’s report fo-
cuses on the varying results they received when different consultants examined the
buildings’ wind design. It is the lack of a consensus method for evaluating buildings
that NIST’s recommendations address, not providing additional requirements for the
design of structures.

A  recent  article  by  Jesse  Beitel  and  Nestor  Iwankiw,  Ph.D.,  P.E.,  from  Hughes
Associates,  Inc.,  in  SFPE’s  Fire  Protection  Engineering  (Summer  2005)  documents
a ‘‘Historical Survey of Multistory Building Collapses Due to Fire.’’ The data in the
article  was  taken  from  a  NIST  survey  performed  in  2002  that  focused  on  buildings
four or more stories tall. The survey covered the time period between 1970 and 2002
and  discovered  a  total  of  22  buildings  that  had  either  full  or  partial  collapse.  The
article states, ‘‘While the number of fire events may appear low (average of one per
year), these fire events are high-consequence occurrences with respect to loss of life,
injuries,  and  economic  costs.’’  When  examining  those  statistics,  five  of  the  fire
events  were  the  result  of  the  September  11  attacks,  and  13  of  the  buildings  were
four  to  eight  stories  tall.  There  were  only  three  ‘‘high-rise’’  buildings  that  involved
any collapse scenario.

The Beitel/Iwankiw article states:

Almost  60  percent  (13/22)  of  the  cases  are  in  the  4–8  stories  range,  with  the
remainder  affecting  much  taller  buildings.  Six  collapses  occurred  in  buildings
over  20  stories,  and  three  of  these  were  the  WTC  steel-framed  buildings  (1,  2,

and 7). At least four of these fire collapses had occurred during construction or
renovations of some kind, when the usual expected architectural, structural and
fire protection functions were still incomplete or temporarily disrupted.

It is common knowledge that a construction site is an unsafe and dangerous envi-
ronment. Additionally, the research for this study does not include any information
determining  whether  the  buildings  conformed  to  any  code  or  standard.  Based  on
NIST’s own study, it appears that the recommendation to increase structural integ-
rity is due to fire events in a total of four collapsed structures four stories or taller
over  a  32-year  period.  Assuming  that  one  of  the  collapses  is  the  Murrah  Federal
Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in which the collapse was the result of a ve-
hicle-borne explosive, this leaves a total of three such fire events worldwide that re-
sulted in collapse or partial collapse of a high-rise building.
Group 2: Enhanced Fire Resistance of Structures

Group  2  (Enhanced  Fire  Resistance  of  Structures)  recommends  that  the  proce-
dures and practices used to ensure that the basis for classification of fire resistance
in buildings should be enhanced.
Recommendation  4.  NIST  recommends  evaluating,  and  where  needed  improving,
the  technical  basis  for  determining  appropriate  construction  classification  and  fire
rating requirements (especially for tall buildings greater than 20 stories in height)—
and making related code changes now as much as possible—by explicitly considering
factors including:

• timely access by emergency responders and full evacuation of occupants, or the

time required for burnout without local collapse;

• the  extent  to  which  redundancy  in  active  fire  protection  (sprinkler  and  stand-
pipe, fire alarm, and smoke management) systems should be credited for occu-
pant life safety;

• the  need  for  redundancy  in  fire  protection  systems  that  are  critical  to  struc-

tural integrity;

• the  ability  of  the  structure  and  local  floor  systems  to  withstand  a  maximum
credible  fire  scenario  without  collapse,  recognizing  that  sprinklers  could  be
compromised, not operational, or non-existent;

• compartmentation  requirements  (e.g.,  12,000  ft2)  to  protect  the  structure,  in-
cluding  fire  rated  doors  and  automatic  enclosures,  and  limiting  air  supply
(e.g., thermally resistant window assemblies) to retard fire spread in buildings
with large, open floor plans;

• the impact of spaces containing unusually large fuel concentrations for the ex-

pected occupancy of the building; and

• the  extent  to  which  fire  control  systems,  including  suppression  by  automatic
or  manual  means,  should  be  credited  as  part  of  the  prevention  of  fire  spread.
Recommendation 5. NIST recommends that the technical basis for the century-old
standard for fire resistance testing of components, assemblies, and systems should be
improved through a national effort. Necessary guidance also should be developed for
extrapolating the results of tested assemblies to prototypical building systems.
Recommendation  6.  NIST  recommends  the  development  of  criteria,  test  methods,
and standards: (1) for the in-service performance of spray-applied fire resistive mate-
rials (SFRM, also commonly referred to as fireproofing or insulation) used to protect
structural  components;  and  (2)  to  ensure  that  these  materials,  as-installed,  conform
to  conditions  in  tests  used  to  establish  the  fire  resistance  rating  of  components,  as-
semblies, and systems.
Recommendation  7.  NIST  recommends  the  nationwide  adoption  and  use  of  the
‘‘structural frame’’ approach to fire resistance ratings.

AIA Response

Enhanced fire resistance was not an issue in the World Trade Center collapse, as
the buildings would have survived even the massive fires caused by the aircraft had
the planes not dislodged fire proofing materials.

Recommendation  4  implies  that  structures  should  be  designed  for  an  aircraft  im-
pact, which does not comport with NIST’s findings. In fact, the lead investigator for
NIST has stated that it is far easier to ensure that airplanes are not used as weap-
ons  against  buildings  than  to  design  for  such  an  event.  As  noted  earlier,  the  in-
stances  of  structural  failure  due  to  fire  are  extremely  rare  and,  in  a  fully

144

sprinklered  building,  even  rarer.  These  facts  do  not  indicate  a  need  for  enhanced
levels of fire resistance in building design.

One  of  the  concerns  expressed  with  regard  to  construction  methods  involves  the
application of spray-on fireproofing. This debate is not new and has been well docu-
mented. It is of concern that, with such a large focus in the report on the fire resist-
ance  of  materials  used  in  the  buildings,  there  is  no  mention  of  the  appropriateness
of  test  standards  such  as  ASTM  E605–00  (Test  Method  for  Thickness  and  Density
of  Sprayed  Fire-resistive  Material  (SFRM)  Applied  to  Structural  Members)  and
ASTM  E736  (Cohesion/Adhesion  of  Sprayed  Fire-Resistive  Materials  Applied  to
Structural  Members),  both  of  which  are  referenced  in  the  International  Building
Code, and thus presumably ‘‘required by code’’ and enforced.

Similarly  lacking  is  reference  to,  or  a  measure  of  the  appropriateness  of,  ASTM
E759 (Effect  of  Deflection  on  Sprayed  Fire-Resistive  Materials  Applied  to  Structural
Members), ASTM E760 (Effect of Impact on Bonding of Sprayed Fire-Resistive Mate-
rials  Applied  to  Structural  Members),  ASTM  E761  (Compressive  Strength  of
Sprayed  Fire-Resistive  Materials  Applied  to  Structural  Members),  ASTM  E859  (Air
Erosion  of  Sprayed  Fire-Resistive  Materials  Applied  to  Structural  Members),  or
ASTM  E937  (Corrosion  of  Steel  by  Sprayed  Fire-Resistive  Materials  Applied  to
Structural Members).

In  recommendation  5,  NIST  suggests  reevaluation  of  the  ASTM  E119  procedure.
The  AIA  believes  that  a  better  approach  would  be  to  take  the  research  performed
by  NIST  using  recognized  testing  procedures  to  explore  how  the  large-scale  testing
compares  with  results  obtained  using  small-scale  tests.  The  fact  that  the  unre-
strained assembly outperformed the restrained assembly is still unexplained. It ap-
pears  that  design  is  still  taking  place  under  the  assumption  that  a  restrained  as-
sembly will outperform an unrestrained assembly.

NIST specifically refers to the AIA in recommendation 6, suggesting that it is im-
portant ‘‘to develop criteria, test methods and standards for the ‘in-service’ perform-
ance of spray-applied fire resistive materials.’’ NIST suggests that MasterSpec is the
appropriate  forum  for  such  activity.  Architects  in  general,  and  MasterSpec  in  par-
ticular, do not have that sole responsibility establishing such standards. Other agen-
cies  or  organizations  develop  standards,  which  are  then  included  in  MasterSpec
where appropriate as requirements for the construction of buildings. Architects and
specifiers often participate in the development of standards, which is appropriate to
assure the applicability of the resulting standards. But it is the collaborative devel-
opment  of  standards  that  should  be  encouraged.  With  the  lack  of  specific  direction
on the use of the standards that even now are found in building codes, it is unclear
what NIST is recommending be done.

Lastly, recommendation 6 suggests adoption of a structural frame approach to de-
sign throughout the United States. However, the requirement for design of a struc-
tural  frame  has  already  been  accomplished  by  the  adoption  of  the  International
Building Code in 45 states.
Group 3: New Methods for Fire Resistance Design of Structures

Group 3 (New Methods for Fire Resistance Design of Structures) recommends that
procedures used to design the fire resistance should be enhanced by considering un-
controlled  fires  to  burnout.  This  recommendation  suggests  that  new  coatings  and
technology for evaluating them be developed to enhance conventional and high-per-
formance structural materials.
Recommendation 8. NIST recommends that the fire resistance of structures should
be enhanced by requiring a performance objective that uncontrolled building fires re-
sult in burnout without local or global collapse.
Recommendation  9.  NIST  recommends  the  development  of:  (1)  performance-based
standards and code provisions, as an alternative to current prescriptive design meth-
ods,  to  enable  the  design  and  retrofit  of  structures  to  resist  real  building  fire  condi-
tions, including their ability to achieve the performance objective of burnout without
structural or local floor collapse: and (2) the tools, guidelines, and test methods nec-
essary to evaluate the fire performance of the structure as a whole system.
Recommendation  10.  NIST  recommends  the  development  and  evaluation  of  new
fire resistive coating materials, systems, and technologies with significantly enhanced
performance and durability to provide protection following major events.
Recommendation  11.  NIST  recommends  that  the  performance  and  suitability  of
advanced  structural  steel,  reinforced  and  pre-stressed  concrete,  and  other  high-per-
formance  material  systems  should  be  evaluated  for  use  under  conditions  expected  in
building fires.

Recommendation 8 suggests consideration of designing to allow ‘‘uncontrolled fires
to burnout.’’ Such circumstances may be a consideration, but are not appropriate in
most  circumstances.  Even  where  there  have  been  uncontrolled  fires  that  caused  a
‘‘burnout,’’ there is no evidence that current procedures are inadequate. In the arti-
cle  by  Beitel  and  Iwankiw,  which  uses  NIST  data,  the  rationale  is  not  present  to
warrant such a major change in building code requirements.

Recommendation  9  reflects  actions  taken  by  both  the  ICC  and  the  NFPA  in  the
development  of  performance  code  criteria.  What  is  currently  lacking  are  the  tools
and  background  information  on  responses  of  buildings  and  the  performance  of  the
elements  within  them  for  any  given  event.  The  AIA  believes  that  NIST  could  pro-
vide  a  significant  resource  to  the  industry  by  examining  actual  fire  scenarios  more
closely  and  developing  guidelines  for  understanding  such  events.  With  that  kind  of
data  available,  designers  would  be  able  to  utilize  a  performance  approach  to  build-
ing safety that is informed by real world evidence.

The  AIA  questions  the  logic  behind  recommendations  10  and  11.  The  report  fre-
quently  expresses  doubt  about  ‘‘innovative’’  design  materials  and  methods  in  its
evaluation  of  the  floor  truss  systems  in  the  World  Trade  Center.  Yet  those  innova-
tive floor framing systems performed as anticipated and were proven to be adequate
based on the tests that NIST performed. Industry will continuously develop innova-
tive  materials  and  systems,  and  the  AIA  believes  that  NIST  can  and  should  play
a vital role in encouraging them by facilitating more realistic testing that would rep-
licate actual construction.
Group 4: Improved Active Fire Protection

Group  4  (Improved  Active  Fire  Protection)  calls  for  enhancements  to  sprinklers,
standpipes,  hoses,  fire  alarms  and  smoke  management  systems,  including  redun-
dancy.
Recommendation  12.  NIST  recommends  that  the  performance  and  redundancy  of
active  fire  protection  systems  (sprinklers,  standpipes/hoses,  fire  alarms,  and  smoke
management  systems)  in  buildings  should  be  enhanced  to  accommodate  the  greater
risks  associated  with  increasing  building  height  and  population,  increased  use  of
open  spaces,  available  compartmentation,  high-risk  building  activities,  fire  depart-
ment response limits, transient fuel loads, and higher threat profile.
Recommendation 13. NIST  recommends  that  fire  alarm  and  communications  sys-
tems  in  buildings  should  be  developed  to  provide  continuous,  reliable,  and  accurate
information  on  the  status  of  life  safety  conditions  at  a  level  of  detail  sufficient  to
manage  the  evacuation  process  in  building  fire  emergencies,  and  that  standards  for
their performance be developed.
Recommendation  14.  NIST  recommends  that  control  panels  at  fire/emergency
command  stations  in  buildings  should  be  adapted  to  accept  and  interpret  a  larger
quantity of more reliable information from the active fire protection systems that pro-
vide  tactical  decision  aids  to  fireground  commanders,  including  water  flow  rates
from  pressure  and  flow  measurement  devices,  and  that  standards  for  their  perform-
ance be developed.
Recommendation 15. NIST recommends that systems should be developed and im-
plemented for: (1) real-time off-site secure transmission of valuable information from
fire  alarm  and  other  monitored  building  systems  for  use  by  emergency  responders,
at  any  location,  to  enhance  situational  awareness  and  response  decisions  and  main-
tain safe and efficient operations; and (2) preservation of that information either off-
site  or  in  a  black  box  that  will  survive  a  fire  or  other  building  failure  for  purposes
of subsequent investigations and analysis. Standards for the performance of such sys-
tems should be developed, and their use should be required.

AIA Response

NIST’s  concerns  about  the  redundancy  of  active  and  passive  fire  protective  sys-
tems are valid in circumstances where all such systems may be rendered ineffective
or inoperative. However, such circumstances are extremely rare, as was the case in
the unprecedented aircraft attack on the World Trade Center. The ICC Performance
Code  for  Buildings  and  Facilities,  NFPA’s  101  Life  Safety  Code  and  5000  Building
Code  already  include  this  approach  to  fire  protection  design  in  their  performance
guidelines. Although the World Trade Center was not designed for such complex cir-
cumstances, it nevertheless performed remarkably well.

Recommendations  13,  14,  and  15  include  opportunities  for  significant  improve-
ment  in  the  performance  of  fire  protection  systems  by  installing  smart  building  de-
vices.  Where  there  is  a  reasonable  risk  of  natural  or  manmade  hazards  to  a  par-

ticular structure, every effort should be taken to ensure the security of the facilities
and protection of the occupants.

Group 5: Improved Building Evacuation

Group  5  (Improved  Building  Evacuation)  addresses  communications  systems  and

the design of means of egress.
Recommendation 16. NIST recommends that public agencies, non-profit organiza-
tions  concerned  with  building  and  fire  safety,  and  building  owners  and  managers
should  develop  and  carry  out  public  education  campaigns,  jointly  and  on  a  nation-
wide  scale,  to  improve  building  occupants’  preparedness  for  evacuation  in  case  of
building emergencies.
Recommendation 17.  NIST  recommends  that  tall  buildings  should  be  designed  to
accommodate timely full building evacuation of occupants due to building-specific or
large-scale emergencies such as widespread power outages, major earthquakes, torna-
does,  hurricanes  without  sufficient  advanced  warning,  fires,  accidental  explosions,
and terrorist attack. Building size, population, function, and iconic status should be
taken into account in designing the egress system. Stairwell and exit capacity should
be adequate to accommodate counterflow due to emergency access by responders.
Recommendation  18.  NIST  recommends  that  egress  systems  should  be  designed:
(1) to maximize remoteness of egress components (i.e., stairs, elevators, exits) without
negatively impacting the average travel distance; (2) to maintain their functional in-
tegrity  and  survivability  under  foreseeable  building-specific  or  large-scale  emer-
gencies; and (3) with consistent layouts, standard signage, and guidance so that sys-
tems become intuitive and obvious to building occupants during evacuations.
Recommendation  19.  NIST  recommends  that  building  owners,  managers,  and
emergency  responders  develop  a  joint  plan  and  take  steps  to  ensure  that  accurate
emergency  information  is  communicated  in  a  timely  manner  to  enhance  the  situa-
tional  awareness  of  building  occupants  and  emergency  responders  affected  by  an
event.  This  should  be  accomplished  through  better  coordination  of  information
among  different  emergency  responder  groups,  efficient  sharing  of  that  information
among  building  occupants  and  emergency  responders,  more  robust  design  of  emer-
gency  public  address  systems,  improved  emergency  responder  communication  sys-
tems,  and  use  of  the  Emergency  Broadcast  System  (now  known  as  the  Integrated
Public Alert and Warning System) and Community Emergency Alert Networks.
Recommendation  20.  NIST  recommends  that  the  full  range  of  current  and  next
generation evacuation technologies should be evaluated for future use, including pro-
tected/hardened  elevators,  exterior  escape  devices,  and  stairwell  navigation  devices,
which  may  allow  all  occupants  an  equal  opportunity  for  evacuation  and  facilitate
emergency response access.

AIA Response

Recommendation  16,  though  well  intentioned,  misses  a  key  element  of  building
safety.  While  ensuring  proper  egress  during  an  emergency  is  important,  too  many
building  owners,  managers  and  occupiers  fail  to  prepare  for  emergencies  before  the
fact.  Examples  of  malfunctioning  or  failed  systems  (such  as  burned  out  exit  sign
lights or fire doors that are blocked by furniture or boxes) are routine, leaving occu-
pants in jeopardy. It is therefore just as important to educate users about maintain-
ing  the  many  life  safety  elements  in  a  building  so  that  they  are  functioning  as  de-
signed when an emergency happens.

Recommendation 17 suggests wider stairwells and greater exit capacity to accom-
modate regarding counter-flow from first responders. This raises a concern about or-
derly  and  controlled  egress.  No  research  is  cited  regarding  the  effect  wider  stairs
may  have,  or  the  possibility  that  evacuating  occupants  will  simply  fill  the  larger
stairwell.  Faster-moving  individuals  will  tend  to  pass  slower  people  descending  the
stairs, potentially leading to conflict and disruption of an orderly egress process.

Regarding the distribution of exits, the current model codes address the minimum
remoteness  issue.  Had  the  stairs  been  more  remote  from  each  other  at  the  World
Trade  Center  there  is  no  guarantee  that  even  hardened  stair  enclosures  would  not
have  been  totally  incapacitated  had  the  aircraft  impacted  the  buildings  at  or  near
the  more  remote  stair.  Placing  stairs  further  outside  the  core  of  buildings  reduces
their level of hardening and leaves them more vulnerable to abuse by the occupants
of the building.

Recommendation  20  calls  for  hardening  of  elevators  and  stairway  enclosures  as
well  as  additional  devices  that  aid  egress.  Unfortunately,  the  hardening  issue  can
be  a  catch-22.  Although  hardening  may  help  in  maintaining  an  element’s  viability

147

in  certain  emergency  situations,  the  hardened  features  may  be  difficult  for  occu-
pants  to  manage  if  they  are  damaged.  Reports  have  emerged  about  individuals
caught  inside  elevators  at  the  twin  towers  who  used  various  devices  to  escape  by
cutting  their  way  through  the  drywall  shaft.  Would  that  have  been  possible  in  a
hardened shaft? Furthermore, the occupants who discovered the single stair that re-
mained  partially  open  to  the  upper  floors  in  WTC  2  would  not  have  been  able  to
remove ‘‘hardened’’ debris and egress those stairs.

Technology for aids to egress are encouraged. However the most promising devel-
opment to assist egress in a tall building is a functioning elevator system, as proven
in WTC 2.

Group 6: Improved Emergency Response

Group  6  (Improved  Emergency  Response)  recommends  technical  and  procedural
changes to gain access to buildings and maintain effective communications and com-
mand and control in large-scale emergencies
Recommendation  21.  NIST  recommends  the  installation  of  fire-protected  and
structurally  hardened  elevators  to  improve  emergency  response  activities  in  tall
buildings  by  providing  timely  emergency  access  to  responders  and  allowing  evacu-
ation of mobility-impaired building occupants. Such elevators should be installed for
exclusive use by emergency responders during emergencies. In tall buildings, consid-
eration also should be given to installing such elevators for use by all occupants.
Recommendation 22. NIST recommends the installation, inspection, and testing of
emergency communications systems, radio communications, and associated operating
protocols  to  ensure  that  the  systems  and  protocols:  (1)  are  effective  for  large-scale
emergencies  in  buildings  with  challenging  radio  frequency  propagation  environ-
ments; and (2) can be used to identify, locate, and track emergency responders within
indoor building environments and in the field.
Recommendation 23.  NIST  recommends  the  establishment  and  implementation  of
detailed procedures and methods for gathering, processing, and delivering critical in-
formation  through  integration  of  relevant  voice,  video,  graphical,  and  written  data
to enhance the situational awareness of all emergency responders. An information in-
telligence sector should be established to coordinate the effort for each incident.
Recommendation 24.  NIST  recommends  the  establishment  and  implementation  of
codes  and  protocols  for  ensuring  effective  and  uninterrupted  operation  of  the  com-
mand and control system for large-scale building emergencies.

AIA Response

Recommendation 21 largely duplicates recommendation 20. Existing elevator tech-
nology  recalls  all  elevators  for  emergency  use.  Whether  hardening  is  appropriate  is
a  serious  question;  it  has  not  been  proven  to  be  appropriate  or  even  desirable  in
those locations where it has been attempted.

Group 7: Improved Procedures and Practices

Group  7  (Improved  Procedures  and  Practices)  addresses  code  compliance  by  non-
governmental  agencies,  adoption  of  egress  and  sprinkler  requirements  in  codes  for
existing buildings and maintenance of building documents over the life of the struc-
ture.
Recommendation 25. Non-governmental and quasi-governmental entities that own
or  lease  buildings  and  are  not  subject  to  building  and  fire  safety  code  requirements
of  any  governmental  jurisdiction  are  nevertheless  concerned  about  the  safety  of  the
building occupants and the responding emergency personnel. NIST recommends that
such entities should be encouraged to provide a level of safety that equals or exceeds
the level of safety that would be provided by strict compliance with the code require-
ments  of  an  appropriate  governmental  jurisdiction.  To  gain  broad  public  confidence
in  the  safety  of  such  buildings,  NIST  further  recommends  that  it  is  important  that
as-designed  and  as-built  safety  be  certified  by  a  qualified  third  party,  independent
of  the  building  owner(s).  The  process  should  not  use  self-approval  for  code  enforce-
ment  in  areas  including  interpretation  of  code  provisions,  design  approval,  product
acceptance, certification of the final construction, and post-occupancy inspections over
the life of the buildings.
Recommendation  26.  NIST  recommends  that  state  and  local  jurisdictions  should
adopt  and  aggressively  enforce  available  provisions  in  building  codes  to  ensure  that
egress  and  sprinkler  requirements  are  met  by  existing  buildings.  Further,  occupancy

148

requirements should be modified where needed (such as when there are assembly use
spaces  within  an  office  building)  to  meet  the  requirements  in  model  building  codes.
Recommendation  27.  NIST  recommends  that  building  codes  should  incorporate  a
provision  that  requires  building  owners  to  retain  documents,  including  supporting
calculations and test data, related to building design, construction, maintenance and
modifications  over  the  entire  life  of  the  building.  Means  should  be  developed  for  off-
site storage and maintenance of the documents. In addition, NIST recommends that
relevant  building  information  should  be  made  available  in  suitably  designed  hard
copy  or  electronic  format  for  use  by  emergency  responders.  Such  information  should
be easily accessible by responders during emergencies.
Recommendation  28.  NIST  recommend  that  the  role  of  the  ‘‘Design  Professional
in  Responsible  Charge’’  should  be  clarified  to  ensure  that:  (1)  all  appropriate  design
professionals (including, e.g., the fire protection engineer) are part of the design team
providing the standard of care when designing buildings employing innovative or un-
usual fire safety systems, and (2) all appropriate design professionals (including, e.g.,
the  structural  engineer  and  the  fire  protection  engineer)  are  part  of  the  design  team
providing the standard of care when designing the structure to resist fires, in build-
ings that employ innovative or unusual structural and fire safety systems.

AIA Response

Recommendations  25  and  26  call  for  the  adoption  and  use  of  codes.  The  AIA  has
long  advocated  that  every  jurisdiction  in  the  Nation,  at  all  levels  of  government,  to
use  a  modern  building  code  that  is  comprehensive,  coordinated  and  contemporary.
The  AIA  believes  that  the  ICC  family  of  codes,  in  conjunction  with  the  NFPA  elec-
trical code, provide the ‘‘bookshelf’’ of codes that should be endorsed by all legislative
and  quasi-legislative  agencies  for  application  on  all  projects.  Adoption  of  a  single
‘‘bookshelf’’  of  codes  utilized  by  all  designers,  builders  and  operators  of  buildings
across  the  Nation  has  been  a  long  sought  goal  of  the  AIA  to  avoid  confusion  in  the
creation of the built environment.

Recommendation 28 calls for the ‘‘design professional in responsible charge’’ to as-
sure  that  the  appropriate  professionals  are  included  on  each  design  team.  This  is,
and  has  been  for  a  long  time,  standard  practice  in  this  country  and  is  demanded
by  the  licensing  criteria  in  all  states.  There  appears  to  be  a  presumption  that  fire
protection  engineers  and  structural  engineers  are  somehow  excluded  from  ‘‘innova-
tive  or  unusual  fire  safety  systems.’’  It  is  most  likely  that  these  designers  are  the
ones  who  are  proposing  innovative  solutions  to  innovative  designs.  It  would  be  un-
ethical  and  unprofessional  to  fail  to  include  a  fire  protection  engineer  or  structural
engineer in such projects.

Group 8: Education and Training

Group  8  (Education  and  Training)  calls  for  the  skills  of  building  and  fire  profes-
sionals  to  be  upgraded  through  education  and  training  of  fire  protection  engineers,
structural engineers, and architects.
Recommendation  29.  NIST  recommends  that  continuing  education  curricula
should be developed and programs should be implemented for training fire protection
engineers  and  architects  in  structural  engineering  principles  and  design,  and  train-
ing structural engineers, architects, and fire protection engineers in modern fire pro-
tection principles and technologies, including fire-resistance design of structures.
Recommendation  30.  NIST  recommends  that  academic,  professional  short-course,
and  web-based  training  materials  in  the  use  of  computational  fire  dynamics  and
thermostructural  analysis  tools  should  be  developed  and  delivered  to  strengthen  the
base of available technical capabilities and human resources.

AIA Response

Recommendations 29 and 30 call for education of members of the design and con-
struction  industry.  As  the  only  professional  organization  in  the  industry  that  holds
its  members  to  a  standard  of  education  (accredited  degrees)  and  continuing  edu-
cation  (18  hours  of  continuing  education  per  year,  of  which  at  least  eight  must  be
related to health, safety and welfare), the AIA applauds NIST’s call to others in the
field to gain additional education.

However,  education  is  only  valuable  if  the  information  is  readily  understood  and
can be incorporated into every-day practice. While computational fire dynamics and
thermostructural  analysis  tools  may  be  helpful  in  certain  circumstances,  they  must
be  of  use  to  those  that  will  make  the  decisions  associated  with  fire  resistance  and
fire protection and design.

STATEMENT BY JAMES G. QUINTIERE

PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PROTECTION ENGINEERING

UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

In  my  opinion,  the  WTC  investigation  by  NIST  falls  short  of  expectations  by  not
definitively  finding  cause,  by  not  sufficiently  linking  recommendations  of  specificity
to  cause,  by  not  fully  invoking  all  of  their  authority  to  seek  facts  in  the  investiga-
tion,  and  by  the  guidance  of  government  lawyers  to  deter  rather  than  develop  fact
finding.

I  have  over  35  years  of  fire  research  in  my  experience.  I  worked  in  the  fire  pro-
gram at NIST for 19 years, leaving as a division chief. I have been at the University
of Maryland since. I am a founding member and past-Chair of the International As-
sociation for Fire Safety Science—the principal world forum for fire research. I have
followed  the  investigation  from  onset  of  the  incident,  as  I  was  about  to  teach  fire
investigators  at  the  ATF  Academy  (FLETC)  in  Georgia  on  the  morning  of  9/11.  I
joined  the  SSC  team  of  Sally  and  Monica  after  we  mutually  discovered  each  other
by  speaking  our  concerns  on  the  WTC  collapse.  I  have  published  in  the  area  of  the
WTC  incident,  our  students  built  a  scale-model  of  the  fire  on  a  floor  of  the  North
Tower,  and  I  have  followed  the  NIST  activities  from  before  their  special  funding.
I  assisted  NIST  early  in  2002  in  viewing  photographs  and  video  held  by  the  NY
Times. I had wished for clear and complete analyses and evidence to determine the
full  cause  of  the  factors  behind  and  the  reasons  for  the  collapse  of  the  WTC  build-
ings,  as  they  bear  on  the  fire  safety  design  of  current  and  future  buildings.  I  am
also concerned about the lack of sufficient government support for fire research and
its implementation in fire safety design, codes and standards.
Concerns about the NIST Investigation

Scientists  at  NIST  should  be  commended  for  their  individual  efforts  in  rising  to
the  occasion  of  the  WTC  investigation.  NIST  should  be  commended  for  organizing
an activity of this scale for the first time. However, there are some issues of concern
that  I  will  summarize.  All  of  these  have  been  submitted  to  NIST,  but  never  ac-
knowledged or answered. I will list some of these.

1. Why is not the design process of assigning fire protection to the WTC towers
fully called out for fault? The insulation thickness of the truss members var-
ied  from  0.5  inches  at  its  construction,  changed  to  a  specification  of  1.5
inches  in  1995,  and  was  taken  on  its  face  as  2.5  inches  for  the  North  tower
fire  floors  based  on  a  PA  report.  This  extraordinary  range  of  thicknesses
bears an in depth investigation. Why were no hearings held or witness testi-
monies heard on this critical design process?

2. Why  were  not  alternative  collapse  hypotheses  investigated  and  discussed  as
NIST  had  stated  repeatedly  that  they  would  do?  Their  current  explanation
for  the  collapse  of  the  towers  is  critically  based  on  an  assumption  that  the
insulation was removed from the steel in the path of the aircraft, particularly
the  core  columns.  NIST  does  not  show  calculations  or  experiments  to  satis-
factorily confirm that the insulation was removed in the core. As some large
aircraft components went directly through the buildings, and NIST indicates
the  others  were  splintered  on  impact,  can  they  explain  why  these  small
splinters could still denude the steel?

3. Spoliation  of  a  fire  scene  is  a  basis  for  destroying  a  legal  case  in  an  inves-
tigation.  Most  of  the  steel  was  discarded,  although  the  key  elements  of  the
core steel were demographically labeled. A careful reading of the NIST report
shows that they have no evidence that the temperatures they predict as nec-
essary  for  failure  are  corroborated  by  findings  of  the  little  steel  debris  they
have. Why hasn’t NIST declared that this spoliation of the steel was a gross
error?

4. NIST used computer models that they said have never been used in such an
application  before  and  are  the  state  of  the  art.  For  this  they  should  be  com-
mended  for  their  skill.  But  the  validation  of  these  modeling  results  is  in
question.  Others  have  computed  aspects  with  different  conclusions  on  the
cause mechanism of the collapse. Moreover, it is common in fire investigation
to  compute  a  time-line  and  compare  it  to  known  events.  NIST  has  not  done
that.

5. Testing  by  NIST  has  been  inconclusive.  Although  they  have  done  fire  tests
of  the  scale  of  several  work  stations,  a  replicate  test  of  at  least  @  of  a  WTC
floor  would  have  been  of  considerable  value.  Why  was  this  not  done?  Espe-
cially,  as  we  have  pointed  out  to  NIST  that  they  may  have  underestimated

the  weight  of  the  furnishings  in  the  North  Tower  by  a  factor  of  3.  As  fire
effects on structure depend on temperature and time, this likely longer burn-
ing  time  is  significant  in  the  NIST  analyses.  Other  tests  of  the  trusses  in
the  UL  furnaces  show  that  the  steel  attains  critical  temperatures  in  short
times,  and  these  temperatures  correspond  to  NIST’s  own  computation  of
truss  failure  for  a  single  truss.  Why  have  these  findings  seemingly  been  ig-
nored in the NIST analyses?

6. The critical collapse of WTC 7 is relegated to a secondary role, as its findings
will not be complete for yet another year. It was clear at the last NIST Advi-
sory Panel meeting in September that this date may not be realistic, as NIST
has  not  demonstrated  progress  here.  Why  has  NIST  dragged  on  this  impor-
tant investigation?

On the Recommendations

The  eight  group-headings  of  the  NIST  recommendations  are  not  specific,  as  they
cannot  connect  directly  to  their  findings.  Instead  they  speak  to  developing,  improv-
ing or advancing technology for safety from fire. Hence, they really cry out for more
research,  technology  adaptation,  and  education  with  respect  to  fire.  This  is  under-
standable as the NIST role has been to be a leader in research, and a source of new
knowledge  for  codes  and  standards.  The  Science  Committee  and  the  Congress
should  take  note  of  the  needs  underlying  the  nature  of  these  recommendations.
They are more a need for research to assist standards.

NFPA testified at the Hearing that the implementation of new performance-based
codes  requires  tools  that  have  not  yet  been  developed  and  nor  are  there  sufficient
people  to  understand  how  to  use  them.  Congressman  Boehlert  pointed  out  to  Sally
Regenhard  many  are  ‘‘do-gooders’’  that  serve  on  the  standard  committees,  but  few
come  to  the  table  with  technical  information  that  is  needed  for  a  full  discussion.
This transfer of technical information for standards in fire safety is only a role that
government can effectively support. The Science Committee should thoughtfully con-
sider how that support could be implemented.

I point out some alarming facts. The fire program at NIST received a boost in the
1970’s  under  the  confluence  of  several  forces:  NSF  advancing  $2  million  per  year
for  fire  research,  consumer  product  safety  legislation  (CPSC),  and  the  funding  ad-
vanced  by  industry  and  government  agencies  for  fire  research  (about  $  2–3  million
per year). This funding has considerably dropped in real dollars. The NIST fire pro-
gram continues to survive by taking contracts from government and the private sec-
tor  that  could  otherwise  support  academic  or  private  industry.  The  extramural  re-
search program of NIST, inherited from NSF, has shrunk from effectively $2 million
to  about  $500k  in  1970  dollars.  The  NSF  has  defaulted  a  fire  program  to  NIST  so
investigators  in  academia  have  no  program  to  turn  to  at  NSF.  The  NASA  micro-
gravity  program  had  taken  up  the  slack  in  fire  research  beginning  about  1985,  but
its  current  fire  research  budget  has  been  decimated  in  a  shift  from  space  station
needed research to a Mars human flight program. The Science Committee has over-
sight over NSF, NASA, and NIST. It should investigate how it can best support the
needed fire research.

NIST speaks to the need for education. I left NIST to contribute to that goal. The
U.S. produces about 50 fire protection engineers per year when about 500 are really
needed.  If  the  fire  service  would  incorporate  fire  engineers  this  number  would  dou-
ble.  There  is  a  big  lack  of  knowledge  here,  and  it  contributes  to  an  infrastructure
of  fire  safety  that  is  currently  fraught  with  good  intentions,  special  interests,  and
ignorance. The Science Committee should recognize this deficiency.

Fireproofing Blown Off Twin Towers

REPORT DETAILS 9/11 COLLAPSE IN N.Y.

BY MICHELLE GARCIA

SPECIAL TO The Washington Post

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 6, 2005; PAGE A03

NEW YORK, April 5—The hijacked airplanes that struck the World Trade Center
hit  with  such  force  that  the  resulting  explosions  blew  the  fireproofing  off  the  steel
columns, accelerating heat buildup and weakening the structural core—contributing
to the towers’ eventual collapse, according to a report issued Tuesday.

The  process  was  hastened  by  fires  outside  that  consumed  the  buildings’  face  and

caused the exterior columns to bow in, according to the report.

Still,  the  study  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  concluded

that no amount of fireproofing could have saved the buildings.

Poor  evacuation  procedures,  lack  of  communication  and  weak  staircases  cost  the
lives of civilians and emergency workers at the towers, as workers waited for direc-
tions and were slow to leave after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, the report said.

Only  two  of  the  198  elevators  in  the  towers  survived  the  initial  explosions—forc-
ing  most  survivors  to  escape  down  emergency  stairwells,  which  had  suffered  exten-
sive damage. The report found that building codes lacked requirements sufficient to
protect the structure of emergency stairwells.

Had such codes been in place, said S. Shyam Sunder, the lead investigator of the

Institute, ‘‘there would have been greater opportunity for people to evacuate.’’

Another  federal  report  issued  Tuesday  found  that  the  economic  impact  of  the  at-
tacks  was  less  than  New  York  officials  had  originally  estimated.  After  the  attacks,
State and city officials said the loss of tax revenue could approach $5.8 billion.

But the Government Accountability Office said the loss attributable to the attacks
was  closer  to  $2.9  billion  and  cited  the  city’s  recession,  which  had  begun  to  take  a
toll before Sept. 11, for the rest of the loss.

The  institute’s  report  on  the  building  collapse  was  long  awaited  by  city  officials.
The institute based its analysis on extensive interviews with about 1,000 survivors,
computer modeling, recovered steel and communications records.

The  Institute  will  use  the  findings  in  the  3,000-page  report  to  formulate  rec-
ommendations—expected for release in September—for changes in national building
codes for office towers. A spokesman at the Port Authority of New York & New Jer-
sey, which owned the World Trade Center, said local and State officials will review
the recommendations and use them to guide reconstruction at Ground Zero.

‘‘Whatever  recommendations  are  adopted  we  will  follow,’’  said  authority  spokes-
man Steve Coleman. ‘‘Our engineering department has oversight over the buildings
[and] will ensure the codes are followed.’’

In the past, city safety codes for office buildings often were a sort of informal com-
promise  between  safety  and  commercial  imperatives.  In  1968,  New  York  City  offi-
cials drastically reduced the number of required stairwells in skyscrapers, at the re-
quest  of  the  real  estate  industry,  to  increase  the  amount  of  available  rental  space.
New York was, in fact, fortunate that the attacks took place in the morning, when
most  people  had  not  yet  reached  their  offices.  If  the  building  had  been  fully  occu-
pied,  the  report  found,  a  full  evacuation  would  have  taken  four  hours  and  cost
14,000 lives.

The agency interviewed survivors and found that, although most had participated
in  a  fire  drill,  nearly  one-half  had  never  used  the  stairwells  in  the  buildings  before
the attacks. In fact, New York City prevents the use of stairwells during fire drills.
‘‘I’ve  never  heard  of  another  jurisdiction  having  such  a  prohibition,’’  Sunder  said.

Staircases in Twin Towers Are Faulted

BY JIM DWYER

The New York Times

APRIL 6, 2005

he  staircases  in  the  twin  towers—their  number,  location,  and  the  weak  walls
around  them—emerged  as  critical  factors  in  the  deaths  of  many  of  those  killed  in
the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, according to a federal safe-
ty  report  released  yesterday.  The  findings  will  be  used  to  shape  federal  rec-
ommendations for building-code changes across the country.

And  after  more  than  two  years  of  intensive  research,  investigators  uncovered
what  they  said  was  an  elementary  shortcoming  in  the  trade  center  towers:  neither
building had enough staircases to meet any of the major building codes in the coun-
try, including New York City’s.

For  nearly  every  man  and  woman  on  the  upper  floors  of  the  towers,  the  lack  of
intact  staircases  meant  that  they  could  not  get  out  after  the  planes  struck.  Clus-
tered  in  the  centers  of  the  buildings,  those  staircases  were  encased  in  lightweight
drywall that was immediately destroyed. Sturdier walls around staircases that were
remote from each other ‘‘might have provided greater opportunities for escape,’’ said
the lead investigator, Shyam Sunder.

In  a  sobering  lesson  drawn  from  one  of  the  day’s  great  successes—the  escape  of
nearly  everyone  below  the  points  of  impact,  about  14,000  people—the  report  said
that  it  had  taken  about  twice  as  long  to  go  down  a  single  flight  of  stairs  as  had
been projected by the current engineering standards for tall buildings. The buildings
were  only  half  full,  investigators  said,  and  if  the  attack  had  come  at  a  time  when
they were filled to occupancy, the evacuation would not have been successful. Thou-
sands more people were likely to have been trapped on the stairs, Mr. Sunder said.
The  report,  issued  by  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  also
formally  confirmed  what  had  long  been  identified  as  a  significant  failure  on  that
day: the leaders of New York’s Police and Fire Departments did not coordinate their
efforts that morning. The investigation suggested that many of the rescuers died be-
cause they simply did not know what was happening around them.

‘‘A  preponderance  of  evidence  indicates  that  a  lack  of  timely  information  sharing
and  inadequate  communications  capabilities  likely  contributed  to  the  loss  of  emer-
gency  responder  lives,’’  the  report  stated.  It  cited  an  interview  with  an  unnamed
firefighter  who  told  the  investigators,  ‘‘If  communications  were  better,  more  fire-
fighters would have lived.’’

The  findings  were  included  in  a  draft  final  report  from  the  institute,  a  branch  of
the  United  States  Commerce  Department  that  was  given  authority  by  Congress  in
2002 to investigate the towers’ collapse, the evacuation and the emergency response.
The findings total some 10,000 pages, of which 3,400 were made public yesterday.
The  remainder  will  be  released  later  in  the  spring,  according  to  Mr.  Sunder.  The
institute will make recommendations on improvements in the areas it studied.

Building-code  changes  are  decided  by  local  governments,  generally  using  model
codes  developed  by  technical  experts  who  work  with  the  insurance  and  real  estate
industries.

In  a  presentation  yesterday  at  a  Times  Square  hotel,  Mr.  Sunder  outlined  the
techniques  used  to  project  the  sequence  of  events  that  led  to  the  collapse  of  each
tower. Although each building was hit by virtually identical planes, the south tower
collapsed in 56 minutes and the north tower in 102 minutes.

A combination of common factors shaped the course of events, he said. The planes
plunged  through  the  exterior  curtain  of  each  building  and  fragmented  as  they
passed  through  the  building,  with  parts  emerging  on  the  other  side.  The  impacts
killed hundreds of people instantly. In the north tower, American Airlines Flight 11,
moving  at  443  miles  per  hour,  took  .685  seconds  to  pass  through  the  building;  in
the south tower, United Airlines 175, hitting at 542 miles per hour, passed through
in .58 seconds.

The impact changed tower structures in two critical ways, Mr. Sunder said. First,
of  the  47  columns  in  the  core  of  each  building,  nine  were  either  severed  or  badly
damaged  in  the  north  tower,  and  11  in  the  south  tower.  Second,  the  impact  dis-
lodged the fireproofing that was sprayed on the floors and the columns. As the fires
ignited by the jet fuel burned, the floors were weakened.

The floors played an important role in the structures, because they connected the
exterior  supports—the  pinstripe  columns  that  gave  the  towers  their  distinctive  ap-
pearance—to  the  columns  hidden  in  the  cores  of  the  buildings.  As  the  unprotected

196

floors were weakened by fire, the exterior columns bowed inwards, the investigators
reported.  In  the  north  tower,  a  photograph  showed  they  had  moved  55  inches  off
center  a  few  minutes  before  the  collapse;  in  the  south  tower,  they  were  20  inches
off center. As those columns became unstable, the building load shifted, but the in-
stability was too great and the cascade of collapse began.

Much  of  the  jet  fuel  burned  outside  the  buildings  in  a  fireball,  but  enough  re-

mained inside to ignite the office furnishings and building contents.

In  its  early  phases,  the  investigation  by  the  institute  raised  serious  questions
about  the  adequacy  of  the  original  fireproofing  applied  to  the  steel  in  the  towers,
and Mr. Sunder said those concerns remained. But, he said, in the areas where the
fires  were  most  severe,  the  amount  of  fireproofing  that  originally  had  been  applied
was ‘‘moot’’ because whatever had been there was knocked off by the planes.

Hundreds of people were trapped above the impact, on floors where there was no
immediate  damage.  This  made  escape  routes  an  important  part  of  the  agency’s
study.

During  the  design  of  the  trade  center,  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New
Jersey  had  decided  to  use  a  new  version  of  the  city  building  code  that  did  not  re-
quire  as  many  staircases  as  the  earlier  edition.  Instead  of  six  staircases,  including
a  specially  reinforced  fire  escape,  the  trade  center  had  three  stairs  in  each  tower.
The  investigators  determined,  though,  that  even  the  liberalized  code  required  a
fourth  staircase,  to  accommodate  the  more  than  1,000  people  expected  in  the  res-
taurant  at  the  top  of  the  north  tower  and  at  the  observation  deck  atop  the  south
tower.

As  an  interstate  agency,  the  Port  Authority  is  not  bound  by  local  building  codes,
but  it  had  publicly  pledged  to  ‘‘meet  or  exceed’’  the  city  code  in  building  the  trade
center. However, the institute investigators determined that the Port Authority had
not supplied enough staircases.

‘‘Once  you  go  over  1,000  people  on  a  floor,  you  need  to  have  a  fourth  stairway,’’
said  Richard  W.  Bukowski,  a  senior  engineer  with  the  institute.  A  spokesman  for
the  Port  Authority  said  its  engineers  believe  that  the  findings  are  mistaken.  New
York City building officials who reviewed the trade center plans, both in the 1960’s
and after the 1993 terrorist bombing, had not raised any questions about the miss-
ing staircase.

Glenn Corbett, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and an adviser
to  the  institute  investigation,  said  he  had  asked  about  the  exits  for  the  restaurant
and  the  observation  deck.  ‘‘Imagine  what  a  staircase  in  the  right  spot  might  have
done for people that day,’’ Mr. Corbett said.

One of the documents included in yesterday’s report showed that the Port Author-

ity was eager to cut down on the amount of space devoted to stairs.

‘‘The tower core should be redesigned to eliminate the fire towers and to take ad-
vantage  of  the  more  lenient  provisions  regarding  exit  stairs,’’  wrote  Malcolm  P.
Levy, the Port Authority’s chief planning engineer, who is now deceased.

In  the  impact  area  of  the  north  tower,  the  three  staircases  were  about  70  feet

apart and were destroyed immediately.

In the south tower, the plane hit on floors where the three staircases were about

200 feet apart, and one of them survived at least partially intact.

3-Year Federal Study of 9/11 Urges Rules for Safer Towers

197

BY JIM DWYER AND ERIC LIPTON

The New York Times

JUNE 22, 2005

After  an  exhaustive,  three-year  study  of  the  collapse  of  the  World  Trade  Center,
a  federal  panel  will  call  for  major  changes  in  the  planning,  construction  and  oper-
ation  of  skyscrapers  to  help  people  survive  not  only  terrorist  attacks  but  also  acci-
dental or natural calamities, according to officials and draft documents.

The  recommendations,  to  be  made  public  tomorrow,  include  a  call  for  a  funda-
mental change in evacuation strategies for tall buildings: that everyone should have
a  way  out  in  an  emergency,  replacing  the  current  standard  of  providing  evacuation
capacity for a few floors near a fire or emergency. The panel also called for sturdier
elevators  and  stairways,  and  found  that  current  standards  for  testing  fireproofing
of steel for tall buildings are flawed.

Taken together, the recommendations, by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology,  are  likely  to  open  an  intense  national  debate  over  the  costs  of  such
changes  and  whether  lessons  for  other  skyscrapers  can  reasonably  be  drawn  from
the extraordinary events of Sept. 11.

The  agency’s  proposals  are  not  binding,  but  are  meant  to  influence  the  policies
of  cities  and  states  across  the  country.  Many  of  them  have  become  public  in  draft
form  during  the  three-year  inquiry  and  have  prompted  fierce  lobbying  or  objections
from  prominent  engineers,  building  industry  professionals,  and  the  Port  Authority
of  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  which  built  the  trade  center.  While  the  agency  has
revised certain aspects of its findings on what precisely happened at the trade cen-
ter, the package of recommendations makes it clear that the agency has essentially
held  firm  on  its  emphatic  and  demanding  safety  agenda  for  the  next  generation  of
tall buildings in America.

S.  Shyam  Sunder,  the  engineer  who  oversaw  the  inquiry  for  the  agency,  said  the
investigators  worked  to  identify  issues  of  ‘‘safety  for  the  vast  majority  of  buildings’’
in fires, earthquakes, power losses and sudden hurricanes. The costs of the changes
are unknown, but structural engineers suggested they would add two to five percent
to development costs of ordinary buildings.

The  study  disclosed  that  critical  design  benchmarks  and  code  standards  used  in
the construction of the trade center—the time it takes to walk down stairs, the dis-
tance  separating  stairways,  and  the  fire-resistance  tests—turned  out  to  have  little
relationship to the experiences or needs of people inside the towers. These findings,
Dr. Sunder said, have broad application to buildings everywhere.

The investigation also found that most building codes do not recognize that people

on high floors are isolated and easily cut off from help during an emergency.

The inquiry, conducted by more than 200 technical experts and contractors work-
ing  for  the  agency,  amounts  to  a  10,000-page  autopsy  of  the  trade  center  collapse.
The  report  includes  25  pages  of  recommendations,  which  will  be  released  for  the
first time as a full set in New York tomorrow.

‘‘The whole purpose of the investigation was to make building occupants and first
responders safer in future disasters and to learn whatever we could from what hap-
pened  on  9/11,’’  Dr.  Sunder  said.  ‘‘The  recommendations  will  be  reasonable  and
achievable.’’

In the United States, building codes are generally adopted by local and State gov-
ernments that use models developed by private groups like the National Fire Protec-
tion Association, established by the insurance industry, and the International Build-
ing Code Council, an organization of government construction regulators. Those two
groups have set up committees to evaluate the recommendations.

‘‘Will  all  the  recommendations  be  accommodated  verbatim  in  building  codes?  I
think the answer is no,’’ said Mohammed M. Ettouney, a principal at Weidlinger As-
sociates,  a  New  York-based  structural  engineering  firm  that  is  doing  the  security-
related design work on the Freedom Tower planned for ground zero. ‘‘But it will act
as a lightning rod for a debate that will now really get under way.’’

The trade center towers, where 2,749 people died in the Sept. 11 attack, were only
one-third  occupied  that  morning.  If  the  buildings  had  been  full,  it  is  likely  that
12,000  more  people  would  have  died  because  of  limited  evacuation  capacity,  the  in-
vestigation found.

Already,  a  proposal  for  wider  exits—making  it  possible  for  people  to  leave  faster
but  reducing  the  amount  of  rentable  space—has  been  rejected  by  one  major  code-
writing organization.

Others  have  suggested  that  it  is  folly  to  think  different  rules  might  have  fore-

stalled the collapses.

‘‘They  are  leading  the  public  down  the  wrong  path,’’  said  Jon  Magnusson,  whose
Seattle-based  structural  engineering  firm,  Magnusson  Klemencic  Associates,  is  the
descendant of the company that designed the twin towers. ‘‘They are saying we are
going  to  fix  the  codes  in  order  to  deal  with  Sept.  11th.  The  physics  say  that  you
can’t do that.’’

Dr.  Sunder  says  that  is  a  mistaken  reading  of  the  investigation.  The  agency,  he
said, does not suggest that buildings should be able to stand up to airplane impacts.
‘‘It is more cost effective to keep terrorists away from airplanes, and airplanes away
from buildings,’’ he said.

The  trade  center  was  built  by  the  Port  Authority,  which  is  not  subject  to  any
building codes. Despite promises by the Port Authority to ‘‘meet or exceed’’ the New
York City code, the federal investigation found that the trade center had fewer exit
staircases than required and that the Port Authority never tested the fire resistance
of  the  floors.  It  also  found  no  evidence  that  a  rigorous  engineering  study  supported
the  authority’s  repeated  public  assertion  that  the  towers  could  stand  up  to  the  im-
pact of a fully loaded commercial airliner.

In recent presentations, Dr. Sunder suggested that agencies that are exempt from
building codes, such as the Port Authority, should have an independent party certify
their compliance with codes, rather than simply deciding for themselves.

The  three-year,  $16  million  federal  investigation  was  broken  into  two  primary
parts.  Using  computers  to  reconstruct  the  attack,  engineers  found  that  when  the
towers  were  struck,  they  redistributed  load  to  surviving  columns.  Once  the  fire
weakened  those  remaining,  extremely  stressed  columns,  whose  fireproofing  had
been knocked off by the planes, the structures collapsed, the report says.

That research found no flaw in the design of the towers that was a critical factor

in the collapse, Dr. Sunder said.

As  the  computer  reconstruction  of  the  towers  proceeded,  others  worked  on  a  sec-

ond inquiry: identifying weaknesses in building codes.

For example, investigators determined that if the towers had been fully occupied,
it would have taken about four hours for survivors to exit, more than twice the time
either tower stood and twice as long as planners had estimated. That led to the call
for changes in evacuation planning.

At  least  some  elevators  in  tall  buildings  should  be  built  with  more  robust  shaft
walls  and  with  electrical  systems  that  will  not  fail  if  exposed  to  water,  the  report
says, so that they can be used to evacuate people who cannot descend long distances
and to take firefighters to high floors.

The  investigation  also  raised  hard  questions  about  the  usefulness  of  a  century-
old  furnace  test  that  measures  the  fire  resistance  of  structural  components.  Last
summer,  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  arranged  a  furnace
test  of  a  17-foot  piece  of  steel  and  concrete  floor,  the  standard  requirement  at  the
time  that  the  towers  were  erected.  The  floor  passed  the  test.  However,  the  tower
floors  were  built  not  with  17-foot  lengths  of  floor,  but  with  35-  and  60-foot  lengths.
When  a  35-foot  length  was  tested  in  the  furnace,  the  floor  failed  the  fire-rating  re-
quirement.

The  recommendations  also  say  that  tall  buildings  should  be  designed  to  prevent
‘‘progressive  collapse,’’  avoiding  a  cascade  of  failures  that  can  bring  down  a  tower
in seconds.

The study found that sprinklers, which can replace or reduce other fire-protection
systems,  should  have  a  redundant  water  supply  or  power  backups,  to  avoid  being
knocked out with one blow. Requirements for how well spray-on fireproofing should
adhere to the steel columns also must be clarified, Dr. Sunder said.

The  debate  over  integrating  the  proposals  into  building  codes  and  practices  will
undoubtedly  be  intense.  Mr.  Magnusson  serves  on  the  special  eight-member  com-
mittee  set  up  by  the  National  Fire  Protection  Association,  along  with  Sally
Regenhard, Chairwoman of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign, who is one of the Na-
tion’s  most  vocal  advocates  for  tougher  building  codes.  She  and  Monica  Gabrielle,
a  co-founder  of  the  skyscraper  campaign,  lobbied  Congress  to  finance  the  agency’s
investigation and have demanded that the institute not dilute its findings.

‘‘We  have  to  restore  the  public’s  perception  of  safety  in  skyscrapers,’’  said  Ms.

Regenhard, whose son, a probationary firefighter, was killed in the attack.

The  International  Building  Code  Council  moved  last  year  to  require  that  towers
taller than about 40 stories have three hours’ worth of fireproofing on structural ele-
ments,  instead  of  two  hours,  but  rejected  proposals  that  would  require  wider  stair-
wells and reinforced concrete or masonry walls in buildings over 25 stories.

The National Fire Protection Association, meanwhile, is expected to act in August
to  require  stairwells  that  serve  2,000  or  more  people  to  be  a  foot  wider  than  cur-
rently mandated, an official at the organization said.

regulators. It is the International Code Council, not the International Building Code

9/11 Firefighters Told of Isolation Amid Disaster

BY JIM DWYER AND MICHELLE O’DONNELL

The New York Times

SEPTEMBER 9, 2005

The  firefighters  had  29  minutes  to  get  out  of  the  World  Trade  Center  or  die.  In-
side  the  north  tower,  though,  almost  none  of  them  realized  how  urgent  it  had  be-
come to leave.

They  had  no  idea  that  less  than  200  feet  away,  the  south  tower  had  already  col-
lapsed  in  a  life-crushing,  earth-shaking  heap.  Nor  did  the  firefighters  know  that
their  commanders  on  the  street,  and  police  helicopter  pilots  in  the  sky,  were  warn-
ing that the north tower was on the edge of the same fate.

Until last month, the extent of their isolation from critical information in the final
29  minutes  had  officially  been  a  secret.  For  three  and  a  half  years,  Mayor  Michael
R.  Bloomberg  refused  to  release  the  Fire  Department’s  oral  histories  of  Sept.  11,
2001. Under court order, however, 12,000 pages were made public in August.

On close review, those accounts give a bleaker version of events than either Mayor
Bloomberg or former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani presented to the 9/11 Commission.
Both had said that many of the firefighters who perished in the north tower realized
the  terrible  danger  of  the  moment  but  chose  to  stay  in  the  building  to  rescue  civil-
ians.

They made no mention of what one oral history after another starkly relates: that
firefighters in the building said they were ‘‘clueless’’ and knew ‘‘absolutely nothing’’
about the reality of the gathering crisis.

In  stairwells  or  resting  on  floors,  they  could  not  see  what  had  happened  or  hear
clearly  stated  warnings.  Even  after  the  south  tower  fell,  when  few  civilians  re-
mained in the lower floors of the north tower, throngs of firefighters lingered in the
lobby and near the 19th floor as time ran down, the survivors said.

‘‘That’s  the  hard  thing  about  it,  knowing  that  there  were  so  many  other  people
still left in that lobby that could have got out,’’ Firefighter Hugh Mettham of Ladder
Company 18 said.

Although no official summary specifies where the 343 firefighters died in the res-
cue effort, a review by The New York Times of eyewitness accounts, dispatch records
and  federal  reports  suggests  that  about  200  perished  in  the  north  tower  or  at  its
foot.

Of 58 firefighters who escaped the building and gave oral histories, only four said
they knew the south tower had already fallen. Just three said they had heard radio
warnings  that  the  north  tower  was  also  in  danger  of  collapse.  And  some  who  had
heard  orders  to  evacuate  debated  whether  they  were  meant  for  civilians  or  fire-
fighters.
‘Not in My Wildest Dream’

‘‘Not in my wildest dream did I think those towers were coming down,’’ said David

Sandvik of Ladder 110.

The  point  made  by  both  Mr.  Giuliani  and  Mr.  Bloomberg  to  the  9/11  Commis-
sion—that  firefighters  died  because  they  delayed  their  own  departures  while  trying
to  save  the  lives  of  civilians  and  other  firefighters—is,  in  one  sense,  fully  corrobo-
rated by the oral histories.

Even  so,  measured  against  the  waves  of  details  in  those  accounts,  those  valiant
last-minute  efforts  explain  just  a  fraction  of  the  firefighter  deaths  in  the  north
tower, a small vivid thread running through the broader fabric of the day.

No  one  in  the  Fire  Department  has  tried  to  use  the  oral  histories  to  reconstruct
the events that led to its human losses that day. Although more than 500 interviews
were conducted, just about 10 percent of them involved people who had been inside
the  north  tower.  (No  firefighters  in  the  south  tower,  which  fell  first,  are  known  to
have  survived  its  collapse.)  Many  who  escaped  from  the  north  tower  did  not  give
histories. Few follow-up questions were asked of those who did.

The ragged character of the records does not yield a clear explanation for the iso-
lation of the rescuers within the building, and whether it was because of radio fail-
ure,  a  loss  of  command  and  control  or  flaws  in  the  Fire  Department’s  management
structure. Some firefighters described receiving a radio message to evacuate; others
used strong language to characterize the communications gear as useless.

Despite  their  spottiness,  the  oral  histories  fill  out  incomplete  chapters  in  the
sprawling  chronicle  of  what  happened  in  New  York  that  morning,  much  of  which
took place far beyond the sight of television cameras and their global audience.

Firefighters  wondered  aloud  how  they  could  have  attacked  a  fire  reached  at  the
end  of  a  four-hour  climb.  They  marveled  at  the  decency  of  office  workers  coming
down the stairs, at the bellowing, dust-coated chief on the sidewalk who herded the
firefighters  clear  of  the  collapse  zone,  at  the  voices  of  experience  that  brooked  no
hesitation.

The final moments of the department’s senior leaders also rise from the histories
as a struggle to rescue dozens of firefighters trapped in the Marriott Hotel after the
south  tower’s  collapse.  As  they  worked,  the  north  tower  crashed  down,  killing,
among  others,  Chief  of  Department  Peter  Ganci,  First  Deputy  Commissioner  Wil-
liam Feehan, and Battalion Chiefs Ray Downey and Lawrence Stack.

Precisely  29  minutes  earlier,  at  9:59  a.m.,  the  fall  of  the  south  tower  shook  the
north  tower  and  stopped  the  slow,  muscular  tide  of  rescuers.  By  then,  the  north
tower firefighters had been on the move for more than an hour. Each carrying about
100 pounds of gear, only a few had climbed much higher than the 30th floor. Some
recalled hearing radio messages from individual firefighters who had made it as far
as the 40’s.

The calamity next door—the collapse of one of the biggest buildings in the world—
was  heard  but  not  seen;  felt  but  not  understood.  The  staircases  had  no  windows.
Radio  communication  was  erratic.  Few  firefighters  even  knew  a  second  plane  had
struck the other building.

From  the  street,  Chief  Ganci  twice  ordered  firefighters  to  evacuate  the  north
tower,  according  to  Chief  Albert  Turi,  but  it  was  not  clear  who  inside,  if  anyone,
heard  him.  Even  Chief  Turi,  standing  a  few  feet  away,  said  it  had  not  come  over
his radio.

Still, many decided to leave after hearing a rumor of a partial collapse some floors

above them, or because they assumed another plane had hit.

On the 37th floor, Daniel Sterling, of Engine Company 24, had stopped with fire-
fighters from Ladder 5 and Engine 33—who did not survive—when the building rat-
tled. A moment later, Firefighter Sterling said, Chief John Paolillo appeared.

‘‘He thought there was a partial collapse of the 65th floor of our building and that

we should drop everything and leave,’’ Firefighter Sterling said.
‘Get Up and Go, Go, Go’

A few floors below, around the 30th or 31st floor, Chief Paolillo was spotted again.
‘‘He  was  yelling,  ‘Leave  your  equipment  and  just  get  up  and  go,  go,  go,’  like  that,’’
Lt. Brian Becker of Engine 28 said. Chief Paolillo died.

The word to leave was passed to the 27th floor, where many firefighters were rest-
ing,  including  Michael  Wernick  of  Ladder  9.  ‘‘I  know  that  there  was  no  urgency  at
that point trying to get out of the building,’’ he said.

‘‘Do  you  think  anyone  around  you  was  aware  that  the  other  building  collapsed?’’

an interviewer asked.

‘‘No,’’ he replied.
One exception was Firefighter John Drumm with Engine 39, who said that on the
22nd  floor,  he  heard  a  transmission:  ‘‘Imminent  collapse  of  the  north  tower.  Imme-
diate evacuation.’’

Then  he  made  a  point  repeated  in  nearly  every  interview:  ‘‘From  what  I  saw  on

the way down, very, very few civilians were left.’’

Firefighter  Sterling  said,  ‘‘There  was  nobody  in  the  staircase  on  the  way  down.’’
Lieutenant  Becker  said,  ‘‘There  were  no  civilians  to  speak  of  in  our  stairway.

There were a couple of stragglers being helped by somebody or other.’’

Probationary  Firefighter  Robert  Byrne  of  Engine  24,  working  his  first  fire,
reached  the  37th  floor.  ‘‘I  remember  going  up  the  stairs  took  us  over  the  hour,’’  he
said. ‘‘Getting down the stairs took maybe 10 minutes, not even.’’

Also  on  37,  Capt.  John  Fischer  of  Ladder  20  discovered  that  two  of  his  company
had  gone  up  ahead.  ‘‘He  was  screaming  at  them  for  them  to  get  back  down,’’  said
Lt. Gregg Hansson of Engine 24, who was with Captain Fischer. ‘‘Then he went up
to get them.’’ Captain Fischer and his men died in the collapse.

Firefighter  William  Green  of  Engine  6  was  one  of  the  few  who  said  he  knew  the
other  tower  had  fallen.  On  the  37th  floor,  ‘‘someone  opened  the  door  from  the  36th
floor  and  said  Two  World  Trade  Center  just  fell  down,’’  he  said.  Over  the  radio,  he
heard ‘‘Mayday, evacuate.’’

Slowed  by  firefighters  entering  the  staircase  below  him,  he  switched  sides.  ‘‘In

hindsight, I think that’s what saved my life,’’ he said.

He did not dawdle. ‘‘Around the fourth floor, I passed this civilian—he might have
been  450  pounds,’’  Firefighter  Green  said.  ‘‘He  was  taking  baby  steps  like  this.  I
walked right past him like all the other firemen. I felt like a heel when I’m walking
past him, and I’m thinking to myself, what does this guy think of me?’’

Yet  other  chronicles  show  that  a  very  heavy  man  in  that  location  was  eventually
dragged to safety by rescuers who included Firefighter Pat Kelly of Rescue 18. Hav-
ing  helped  move  the  man  outside,  Firefighter  Kelly  was  the  only  member  of  his
squad to survive. He did not give an oral history.

Elsewhere, crowds of firefighters lingered.
Lt. William Walsh of Ladder 1 said he heard a Mayday to evacuate when he was
around the 19th floor, but did not know that a plane had struck the other building,
much less that it had collapsed. As he descended, he saw firefighters who were not
moving.
No Rush to Get Out

‘‘They were hanging out in the stairwell and in the occupancy and they were rest-
ing,’’  Lieutenant  Walsh  said.  ‘‘I  told  them,  ‘Didn’t  you  hear  the  Mayday?  Get  out.’
They were saying, ‘Yeah, we’ll be right with you, Lou.’ They just didn’t give it a sec-
ond thought. They just continued with their rest.’’

Three  court  officers  reported  seeing  as  many  as  100  firefighters  resting  on  the
19th floor minutes before the building fell, but they were not questioned by the Fire
Department.

Mayor Bloomberg, in a letter to the 9/11 Commission, wrote: ‘‘We know for a fact
that  many  firefighters  continued  their  rescue  work  despite  hearing  Maydays  and
evacuation orders and knowing the south tower had fallen.’’

Asked to reconcile this statement with the oral histories, the city Law Department
cited the accounts of eight firefighters and said that each of them surely had spread
the word about the collapse of the other tower. In fact, in six of those oral histories,
the firefighters specifically said they did not know the other building had fallen.

In the lobby, just yards from safety, survivors said that uncertainty doomed many

firefighters.

John  Moribito  of  Ladder  10  said  there  were  maybe  ‘‘40  or  50  members  that  were
standing  fast  in  the  lobby.’’  Roy  Chelsen  of  Engine  28  said,  ‘‘There  were  probably
20  or  30  guys  down  in  the  lobby  mulling  around.’’  The  interviewer  asked,  ‘‘They
weren’t trying to get out?’’

‘‘They were just—no, no,’’ Firefighter Chelsen recalled.
His officer, Lieutenant Becker said, ‘‘There was chaos in the lobby. It was random
people  running  around.  There  was  no  structure.  There  were  no  crowds.  There  was
no—no operation of any kind going on, nothing. There was no evacuation.’’

Firefighters  with  Ladder  11  and  Engine  4  came  down  together  to  the  lobby,  but
not  all  made  it  out.  ‘‘Everyone  is  standing  there,  waiting  to  hear  what’s  going  to
happen next, what’s going on,’’ Frank Campagna of Ladder 11 said.

His  company  left,  and  a  moment  later,  ‘‘it  came  down  on  top  of  us,’’  Firefighter
Campagna  said.  ‘‘Four  Engine  obviously  didn’t  make  it  out.  They  were  with  us  the
whole time, so I’m assuming they were still in the lobby at that time.’’

The  firefighters  of  Ladder  9  lingered  briefly,  and  most  were  clear  of  the  building
for  less  than  a  minute  when  it  fell.  Firefighter  Wernick  remembered  seeing  two
members  of  his  company  in  the  lobby,  Jeffrey  Walz  and  Gerard  Baptiste.  They  did
not escape. The funeral for Firefighter Baptiste, whose remains were identified this
year, was held on Wednesday.
A Figure Coated in Dust

Over and over, firefighters who had left the building in those final minutes, bewil-
dered  by  the  sudden  retreat,  the  ruined  lobby,  the  near-empty  street,  mentioned  a
chief covered in the dust of the first collapse, standing just outside the north tower
on West Street.

Some knew his name: Deputy Assistant Chief Albert Turi.
‘‘He  was  screaming,  ‘Just  keep  moving.  Don’t  stop,’ ’’  Firefighter  Thomas  Orlando
of  Engine  65  recalled,  adding,  ‘‘I  still  didn’t  know  the  south  tower  collapsed.’’  Chief
Turi, he said, ‘‘saved an awful lot of people.’’ The chief has since retired.

In  blunt  speech,  free  of  the  mythic  glaze  that  varnished  much  9/11  discourse,
some firefighters wondered why an endless line of rescuers had been sent to an un-
quenchable fire that raged 1,000 feet up.

‘‘I  think  if  this  building  had  collapsed  an  hour  later,  we  would  have  had  a  thou-
sand firemen in there,’’ said Firefighter Timothy Marmion of Engine 16, who carried
a woman on a stretcher from the staircase to an ambulance.

‘‘If it would have collapsed three hours later,’’ he said, ‘‘we would have had 10,000

firemen in those buildings.’’

Had the buildings not fallen, the gear-laden firefighters would have needed about
four  hours—almost  as  long  as  it  takes  to  fly  across  the  country—to  reach  workers
trapped on the high floors.

‘‘We were just as much victims as everybody that was in the building,’’ Firefighter

203

Derek Brogan of Engine 5 said.

‘‘We  didn’t  have  a  chance  to  do  anything,’’  he  added.  ‘‘We  didn’t  have  a  chance

to put the fire out, which was really all we were trying to do.’’

BUILDING SAFETY: Directing the Herd: Crowds and the

Science of Evacuation

BY JOHN BOHANNON

Science, Vol. 310, Issue 5746, 219–221

OCTOBER 14, 2005

No  skyscrapers  are  designed  to  be  able  to  disgorge  all  their  occupants  in  a  dire
emergency  like  the  attack  on  the  World  Trade  Center  towers.  Can  they  be  made
safer?

VIENNA,  AUSTRIA—In  the  hour  and  42  minutes  that  elapsed  between  the  first
airplane  strike  on  the  World  Trade  Center  (WTC)  on  11  September  2001  and  the
collapse  of  both  towers,  more  than  2000  people  failed  to  escape.  Roughly  500  occu-
pants  are  believed  to  have  died  immediately  upon  impact,  and  more  than  1500
trapped  in  upper  floors  died  in  the  aftermath.  The  toll  might  have  been  far  worse,
according  to  studies  presented  here  at  the  International  Conference  on  Pedestrian
and Evacuation Dynamics on 28 to 30 September. Had the same attack come when
the  towers  were  at  their  full  capacity  of  20,000  people  each,  says  Jason  Averill,  a
fire  safety  engineer  at  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)
in Gaithersburg, Maryland, the staircases would have quickly grid-locked, resulting
in some 14,000 deaths.

No  tall  building  is  designed  to  be  fully  evacuated.  Instead,  regulations  typically
require  that  a  few  floors  be  emptied,  assuming  nothing  worse  than  a  localized  fire.
‘‘This  has  to  change,’’  says  Shyam  Sunder,  Deputy  Director  of  NIST’s  Building  and
Fire Research Laboratory, ‘‘because in the lifetime of a building, there will be situa-
tions where you’ve got to get everyone out.’’

But  getting  everyone  out  of  harm’s  way  will  require  a  deeper  understanding  of
the collective behavior of crowds, says Jake Pauls, a veteran building safety consult-
ant now based in Silver Spring, Maryland. Researchers are ‘‘just scratching the sur-
face,’’  says  Averill,  although  they  have  made  leaps  and  bounds  over  the  past  few
years. Studies presented at the meeting offered a glimpse of how evacuations could
be conducted more safely.
Modeling mobs

Until  recently,  there  was  little  science  in  emergency  planning,  says  Ed  Galea,  a
fire  safety  engineer  at  the  University  of  Greenwich,  U.K.  That  is  changing  as  sci-
entists try to capture the behavior of crowds using computer simulations. A diverse
effort is under way to refine these models with real-world data. For example, a team
led by Jean Berrou, a computer scientist at the Maia Institute in Monaco, has been
secretly filming pedestrians in 10 different cities around the world, analyzing nearly
1000 hours of video to measure different cultural patterns of walking. For example,
he says, ‘‘pedestrians in London are faster than those in New York.’’

The goal is to find rules that individual pedestrians unconsciously follow to navi-
gate  crowded  spaces.  ‘‘What’s  amazing  is  that  people  don’t  collide  with  each  other
more  often  on  a  typical  city  sidewalk,’’  says  Jon  Kerridge,  a  computer  scientist  at
Napier  University  in  Edinburgh,  U.K.  On  a  scale  of  microseconds,  people  negotiate
priority  with  cues  transmitted  through  body  language.  ‘‘If  we  can  understand  how
that works,’’ he says, we might learn why certain geometries of corridors and portals
work better than others.

The  next  step  is  to  understand  how  an  emergency  changes  everything.  Research-
ers use a parameter called drive to define the level of motivation people have to go
from  A  to  B.  ‘‘This  is  where  things  get  very  difficult  to  model,’’  says  Kerridge,  ‘‘be-
cause we’re talking about innate, personal factors.’’

Strange things happen when fear is added to the mix. Take the paradox that the
more  urgently  people  want  to  leave  a  crowded  room  with  a  narrow  exit,  the  longer
it  takes  to  get  out.  That  occurs  in  part  because  of  a  breakdown  in  normal  commu-
nications. Daniel Parisi and Claudio Dorso, computer scientists at the University of
Buenos  Aires,  Argentina,  have  found  that  the  optimum  exit  speed  is  a  fast  walk  of
about 1.38 meters per second.

Such  studies  reveal  that  ‘‘the  fundamental  unit  of  a  crowd  is  not  the  individual
but  the  cluster,’’  says  Kerridge.  This  is  because  ‘‘the  first  thing  we  do  in  an  emer-
gency situation is look to each other for support and information.’’ But that response
slows movement dramatically. On a larger scale, people form groups similar to ani-
mal herds in which individuals let the crowd do the navigating, often passing right
by exits within clear view.

Learning  to  predict  and  control  these  behaviors  may  save  lives—and  not  just  in
big  buildings.  The  main  killer  when  people  mass  is  not  trampling,  as  is  commonly

thought,  but  ‘‘crowd  crush.’’  When  two  large  groups  merge  or  file  into  a  dead  end,
the density makes it impossible to fall down, says Pauls. But the accumulated push-
ing  creates  forces  that  can  bend  steel  barriers.  ‘‘The  situation  is  horrible,’’  he  says:
‘‘Suddenly  everything  goes  quiet  as  peoples’  lungs  are  compressed.  No  one  realizes
what’s  happening  as  people  die  silently.’’  Dangers  like  these  make  designing  archi-
tecture  and  procedures  for  evacuation  like  a  tightrope  walk,  says  Pauls:  ‘‘You  have
to get people out fast, but safely.’’
Revisiting 9/11

Armed  with  these  insights,  two  separate  groups  have  been  trying  to  model  the
WTC evacuation to see what lessons can be learned. In 2002, the U.S. Congress or-
dered  NIST  to  investigate  the  WTC  safety  and  emergency  response,  and  the  U.K.
government commissioned a team led by Galea, which has paved the way for a larg-
er  study  called  HEED.  ‘‘This  was  one  of  the  largest  full-scale  evacuations  of  people
in modern times,’’ says Galea.

To  build  a  minute-by-minute  chronology  of  the  event,  the  NIST  team  has  con-
ducted  more  than  1000  interviews  with  survivors  by  telephone,  and  Galea’s  team
is set to do up to 2000 face-to-face interviews next year. One of the most surprising
discoveries,  says  Galea,  is  the  long  lag  time  between  the  first  attack  and  the  start
of  evacuation.  Galea’s  team  found  that  although  77  percent  of  survivors  began  the
egress  within  five  minutes  of  the  impact,  it  took  another  hour  for  the  next  19  per-
cent to get going, and four percent stayed in their offices for over an hour. ‘‘In some
cases people were more worried about saving their computers,’’ he says.

Both  teams  have  incorporated  these  data  into  a  model  called  EXODUS,  designed
by  Galea.  When  the  NIST  team  used  the  model  to  play  out  the  WTC  disaster  with
full  occupancy,  it  estimated  roughly  14,000  deaths,  most  among  those  stuck  on  the
stairs. This didn’t surprise Pauls.

‘‘Those stairs were not designed to handle a full evacuation,’’ he says. ‘‘In fact, no
tall building is prepared for it.’’ Sunder says NIST is pushing to include full evacu-
ation  for  many  tall  buildings  in  the  next  review  of  U.S.  building  codes  in  2008.
‘‘There  is  a  lot  of  resistance’’  to  requiring  full  evacuation  capability  even  after  the
WTC attacks because people ‘‘believe that was a one-time-only event,’’ he says. But
he  notes  that  a  building’s  typical  lifetime  is  a  century;  designers  should  be  pre-
paring for other ‘‘extreme events’’ like multi-floor fires, earthquakes, and hurricanes.
Until  the  existing  tall  buildings  are  replaced  with  a  new  generation,  experts  say,
improvements  will  have  to  come  through  better  emergency  procedures  and  retro-
fitting.  For  one,  elevators  should  be  made  usable  during  emergencies,  says  Sunder.
WTC  tower  number  2  emptied  far  more  efficiently  than  tower  1  because  its  ele-
vators were available before it was hit by the second plane, the studies found. New
elevator  systems  that  include  independent  power  supplies  and  computers  that  pre-
vent them from opening on a burning floor will be available within a few years, says
Averill.  Galea  suggests  another  possible  innovation:  adding  sky  bridges  to  create
new  escape  routes  linked  to  other  buildings.  His  simulation  of  a  WTC  evacuation
with the towers linked by a bridge was far more efficient.

Evacuation  experts  say  they  are  continuing  to  look  at  all  kinds  of  evacuation
backups, even far-out ones. For example, a pole system that can be attached to the
outside  of  buildings  is  being  tested.  By  strapping  into  a  vest  attached  to  the  pole,
people could slide down safely using electromagnetic brakes. Another option: People
could  jump  into  fabric  tubes  and  bounce  their  way  down  to  the  bottom—although
this would likely cause friction burns. Even parachutes have been proposed as a last
chance resource.

‘‘But  really,  the  best  thing  we  can  do  to  make  these  buildings  safer,’’  says  Pauls,

‘‘is to focus on the basics.’’ That means better stairs, elevators, and fire drills.
