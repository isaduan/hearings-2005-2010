RECENT  SETBACKS  TO  THE  COAST  GUARD 

DEEPWATER  PROGRAM 

WEDNESDAY,  FEBRUARY  14,  2007 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON OCEANS, ATMOSPHERE, FISHERIES, 
AND COAST GUARD, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:38  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building.  Hon.  Maria  Cantwell, 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Good  afternoon,  the  Subcommittee  of  the 
Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation  Committee  on  Oceans,  At-
mosphere,  Fisheries,  and  Coast  Guard  will  come  to  order.  I  thank 
my colleague, Senator Snowe, for being here. I know we’ll be joined 
by other colleagues during this hearing, and I thank the witnesses 
for being here today, as well. 

As the Chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fish-
eries, and Coast Guard, I’m proud to welcome you to our first hear-
ing of the 110th Congress. It’s going to be a busy year for this Sub-
committee,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  Senator  Snowe,  as 
well as Senators Inouye and Stevens on how we address issues af-
fecting our oceans and our coasts. 

I  appreciate  that  our  witnesses  are  taking  time  from  their  busy 
schedules,  and  no  one  was,  basically,  shooed  away  by  a  little 
weather  in  Washington,  D.C.  and  that  you  have  made  an  oppor-
tunity for us to hear from all of you. 

I  want  to  thank  you,  Admiral  Allen,  for  joining  us  today.  I  look 
forward  to  your  testimony,  and  I  want  you  to  know  that  I  believe 
that  we  are  allies  in  getting  the  Coast  Guard  the  assets  that  it 
needs.  And  in  our  conversations,  you  have  always  struck  me  as  a 
man  of  true  action,  a  problem  solver,  and  a  respected  leader.  And 
we  owe  you  a  debt  of  gratitude,  both  as  the  Atlantic  Area  Com-
mander  during  9/11,  and  for  your  heroic  efforts  in  the  aftermath 
of Hurricane Katrina. So, thank you. 

I  also  want  to  thank  Mr.  Skinner  and  Mr.  Caldwell  for  being 
here, as well. Welcome, and thank you for providing Congress with 
the  critical  information  needed,  and  the  oversight  role  and  respon-
sibilities  that  we  are  here  to  hear  about  today.  I  look  forward  to 
your expert testimony.

2 

Obviously,  our  Nation  needs  a  strong  Coast  Guard,  for  our  na-
tional  security,  and  our  domestic  security.  The  Coast  Guard’s  key 
mission  of  maritime  safety,  aiding  navigation,  protecting  natural 
resources,  ensuring  national  security,  are  of  enormous  benefit  to 
our  country.  It  is  the  Coast  Guard  that  ensures  that  vessel  traffic 
moves smoothly, that our ports are secure, and our fishery laws are 
enforced, and our shores stay clean. 

I  think  I’ve  said  this  at  this  hearing  before,  Senator  Snowe,  and 
others—there’s  no  agency  that  does  more  with  less  in  the  United 
States  than  the  Coast  Guard,  and  we  thank  them  for  their  added 
responsibilities  post-9/11.  I  know  well,  in  Washington  State  with 
Puget Sound, which is one of the most busy, complex waterways in 
the  world—the  Port  of  Tacoma  being  the  third-largest  port  in  the 
Nation. It moves about 11,000 cargo containers daily, and we have 
cruise ship traffic that makes for a very demanding sea port. 

Last  year,  2,000  oil  tankers  and  tank  barges  made  more  than 
4,000  trips  across  Puget  Sound,  which  makes  oil  transportation 
safety  very  important.  Our  passenger  ferry  system,  which  the 
Coast  Guard  helps  us  on  with  security  today,  carries  more  people 
on an annual basis, I believe, than Amtrak does. That says nothing 
of  other  complexities  of  that  waterway  with  fishing  and  rec-
reational boating. 

So,  all  of  this  is  to  say  that  the  Coast  Guard  is  very  important 
to  us,  as  a  nation,  and  I  very  much  understand  its  importance, 
along  with  its  international  border  and  drug  interdiction  missions 
and responsibilities. 

Today,  we  are  here  to  discus  problems,  though,  that  we  have 
seen  with  the  Deepwater  Program.  And,  to  look  for  ways  to  move 
forward. 

Before  we  begin,  I  want  everyone  at  this  hearing  to  know  that, 
in  my  opinion,  all  options  are  on  the  table.  And  that  is,  that  we 
will  look  at  the  Deepwater  Program  and  the  challenges  that  we 
have  seen  in  the  last  several  years,  and  I  believe,  do  whatever  it 
takes  to  correct  the  problems  and  give  the  resources  and  assets  to 
the Coast Guard that they need. 

Four  recent,  independent  reports  now  show  us  that  the  Deep-
water  Program  is,  indeed,  in  deep  trouble.  The  Program  is  not  de-
livering  as  promised.  If  someone  thought  this  was  a  creative  way, 
an  experiment—which  I  think  was  the  original  intention—I  think 
that  it  has  shown  a  failure  at  a  cost  of  millions  of  dollars  to  the 
taxpayers. 

Today,  the  Deepwater  Program  has  failed  to  deliver  on  key  as-
sets—a  123-foot  patrol  boat  conversion,  the  8  Coast  Guard  patrol 
boats  that  are  now  out  of  service,  and  $100  million  is  in  question. 
After  spending  $25  million,  the  Coast  Guard  suspended  the  Fast 
Response  Cutter  Project,  because  the  contractor  design  failed  to 
meet testing requirements. The first two National Security Cutters 
are  at  least  $500  million  over  budget,  and  the  current  design  and 
construction  fails  to  meet  the  Coast  Guard  performance  goals,  and 
I  know  we’re  going  to  hear  a  lot  about  that.  And  the  Deepwater’s 
unmanned  aerial  vehicle,  Eagle  Eye,  has  huge  delays,  and  prob-
lems with the prototype. 

Obviously,  there  are  issues  and  concerns  about  the  National  Se-
curity Cutter, and the cost. I believe that if the current Deepwater

contract  isn’t  delivering  the  results—which  I  believe  that  it  isn’t— 
then  we  must  look  for  a  new  approach.  I  am  concerned  that  the 
contract  gives  industry  too  much  authority  to  grant  contracts  to 
itself  without  open  competition.  This  offers  little  incentive  to  con-
trol  costs,  and  sidelines  the  Coast  Guard  when  it  comes  to  over-
sight. 

Just  this  last  week,  the  Department  of  Defense  Acquisition  Uni-
versity—an  organization  of  experts  on  defense  contracting—re-
leased  a  report  on  Deepwater,  I  believe  it  was  released  February 
5.  The  report  makes  key  recommendations  for  improving  Deep-
water,  and  also  points  out  the  positive  steps  the  Coast  Guard  has 
already taken to reform their acquisition process. It specifically rec-
ommends  that  the  Coast  Guard,  ‘‘define  and  implement  a  revised 
acquisition  strategy  that  does  not  rely  on  a  single  industry  entity 
or contract to produce or support all, or the majority, of U.S. Coast 
Guard capabilities.’’ 

Today,  I  hope  we  can  begin  to  move  forward  quickly  and  con-
structively  on  that  revised  strategy,  so  that  the  Coast  Guard  re-
ceives  the  ships,  planes,  and  technologies  that  it  needs,  and  at  a 
fair price to the American taxpayer. 

I am committed to doing all that is necessary to ensure that this 
program  gets  on  the  right  track,  that  the  Coast  Guard  gets  what 
it needs in upgrading its fleet and air assets, in order to carry out 
its mission of safety, security on our Nation’s coastlines and water-
ways. 

This  hearing  is  an  opportunity  for  a  fair  and  honest  discussion 
about  Deepwater—both  the  successes,  as  well  as  the  failures—and 
how  we  can  move  forward  on  getting  the  resources  that  we  need 
for  our  coastal  areas  of  our  country.  So,  I  look  forward  to  working 
with my colleagues who are here today, and I want to again, thank 
them  for  joining  us,  and  I  would  like  to  turn  to  my  colleagues,  if 
they  would—Senator  Snowe,  if  you  would  like  to  make  an  opening 
statement. 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I certainly appre-
ciate  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  you  on  assuming  your  posi-
tion  as  chair  of  this  subcommittee.  It  is  a  critical  subcommittee  in 
terms  of  the  jurisdiction  over  the  Coast  Guard,  and  the  contribu-
tions  that  you  have  made—you’re  not  unfamiliar  with  all  the 
issues, the programs that are involved, and I appreciate the leader-
ship that you’ll be providing on this subcommittee. 

I  just  want  to  say  a  few  words  about  one  of  the  reasons  why  we 
are here today, and as chair of this subcommittee for, pretty much 
all  of  my  career  in  the  U.S.  Senate  thus  far.  We’re  here  to  discuss 
the single-most vital Homeland Security acquisition program that’s 
confronting our Nation. That is, of course, Deepwater. 

Regrettably,  despite  the  tremendous  urgency  of  upgrading  the 
Coast  Guard’s  assets  on  the  water  and  in  the  air,  we’re  compelled 
to  focus  our  attention  to  the  Coast  Guard’s  apparent  failure  man-
aging this multi-billion, multi-year project. 

I  know  that,  Madam  Chair,  you  share  my  concerns  about  the 
troubling  panic  that  developed  and  emerged  concerning  the  mis-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

management  of  this  program  over  a  number  of  years.  It  was  dis-
closed, initially, in The New York Times, and obviously the Inspec-
tor General, whom we’ll be hearing from as well, discovered and re-
vealed, and it’s indisputable that we must restore accountability to 
the  Deepwater  Program,  for  the  sake  of  our  critical  Coast  Guard 
service, and our homeland security. 

I’m  deeply  troubled  that  this  mismanagement  was  a  breach  of 
trust,  with  the  American  people  and  also  undermines  a  program 
that is so vitally important to our future. 

First,  we  must  understand  exactly  what  happened,  in  order  to 
move  forward,  and  why.  And  starting  with  the  National  Security 
Cutter.  As  was  revealed  in  the  initial  reports,  back  on  December 
9,  in  The  New  York  Times,  and  by  the  Inspector  General  last 
month,  ‘‘the  Coast  Guard  was  fully  aware  of  the  significant  design 
problems with this cutter since at least 2004, if not earlier. The in-
vestigators  found  that  the  design  of  the  ship,  if  not  corrected  at 
considerable cost to the United States taxpayer may not allow it to 
meet a 30-year fatigue-life.’’ In addition, they reported that the de-
sign and performance deficiencies were fundamentally the result of 
the Coast Guard’s failure to exercise its technical and management 
oversight. 

And  now,  I’m  profoundly  troubled  with  further  reports  that  the 
Coast  Guard  intentionally  omitted  problems  of  the  National  Secu-
rity  Cutter,  when  submitting  documents  to  the  Inspector  General. 
Unquestionably, the Coast Guard has further jeopardized the trust 
that  is  so  essential  to  the  support  of  this  vital  program,  if  this  is 
true. 

Indeed, I’m not only troubled to learn of the Coast Guard’s prob-
lem  with  managing  Deepwater  and  working  with  the  Inspector 
General,  I’m  equally  distressed  about  how  these  transgressions 
may have damaged the Coast Guard’s relationship with those of us 
in Congress, who have been the champions of this program. I have 
been,  as  I  said,  the  chair  of  this  oversight  subcommittee,  for  more 
than 10 years. 

Deepwater  has  been  the  subject  of  numerous  hearings  since 
2001, under my leadership. In addition, I have requested two GAO 
audits of the Coast Guard’s Deepwater oversight. I asked Secretary 
Chertoff  to  conduct  a  best-practices  review  of  Deepwater  manage-
ment,  inserted  language  in  three  separate  Coast  Guard  authoriza-
tion  bills  directing  the  Coast  Guard  to  report  on  Deepwater  assets 
and  time-lines.  In  fact,  last  October  my  staff  visited  the  Northrop 
Grumman  Shipyard  in  Mississippi,  where  the  Coast  Guard  gave 
them  a  tour  of  the  National  Security  Cutter  from  stem  to  stern. 
They received no indication of any problems, whatsoever. 

Despite the numerous means by which we exerted our oversight, 
the  Coast  Guard  failed  to  alert  us  to  any  allegations  or  investiga-
tions into the problems with the Deepwater Program. Not once dur-
ing these hearings, briefings or visits, was there any mention of the 
significance of structural design issues, or fatigue-life concerns. 

Not once did the Coast Guard relate to Congress the intensity of 
the  debate,  and  the  seriousness  of  the  issue  within  the  Coast 
Guard  itself.  And,  of  course,  with  the  Inspector  General—even 
though it was a pending report, even though it had not been final-
ized—surrounding what many have called the flagship of the Deep-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

5 

water  effort—the  failure  to  inform  us  of  such  serious  structural 
failings  of  the  National  Security  Cutter  was  unprecedented,  and 
unacceptable. 

It’s  simply  unconscionable  the  Coast  Guard  did  not  bring  these 
issues  to  light  prior  to  December  2006,  and  again,  it  was  a  result 
of a story that was disclosed in The New York Times. 

Transparency and accountability are essential to any program of 
this  enormity  and  magnitude,  and  even  more  so  given  the  innova-
tive nature of Deepwater’s public/private partnership. And yet, the 
Coast  Guard  has  had  considerable  difficulties  with  oversight  and 
execution  of  the  Deepwater  acquisitions.  Here  we  are,  stunned  by 
the scale and the scope of management failures that threaten to de-
rail  the  entire  program.  Our  taxpayers,  our  national  security,  are 
not  well-served  by  the  ‘‘ruthless  execution’’—and  I  put  that  in 
quotes,  because  that’s  what  we  were  told  repeatedly—that  the 
Coast  Guard  has  demonstrated  in  charging  forward  on  the  Na-
tional Security Cutter, despite grave concerns with the ship. 

Admiral,  understanding  what  went  wrong  in  all  of  these  in-
stances  is  only  the  first  of  many  steps  essential  to  correcting 
Deepwater’s course. The second step is for all parties to hold them-
selves  accountable  for  their  roles  and  decisions.  Admiral,  I  appre-
ciate  that  you’ve  assured  me  in  writing,  and  of  course,  in  our  sub-
sequent  meetings  and  telephone  calls,  that  you  hold  yourself  per-
sonally  accountable  and  responsible  for  all  of  the  Coast  Guard  ac-
tions, regardless of when the decisions were made, and I appreciate 
that.  It  will  be  critical  that  the  commitment  to  reorganize  Coast 
Guard  leadership  that  you  expressed  in  yesterday’s  State  of  the 
Coast Guard Address comes to fruition to help stem the tide of poor 
decisions that brought us to this point. 

Moreover,  in  light  of  the  recently  released  report  of  the  Defense 
Acquisition  University,  recommending  changes  in  Deepwater’s  ac-
quisition strategy, contract structure and management, I expect the 
Coast  Guard  to  develop  and  present  to  Congress  a  detailed  plan, 
outlining  its  strategy  for  regaining  control  of  this  program,  before 
coming to a final agreement with the ICGS in the next Deepwater 
award term. 

Any  new  strategy  must  include  the  Coast  Guard  improving  its 
acquisition  procedures  and  re-asserting  its  oversight  responsibil-
ities.  To  do  anything  less,  places  the  entire  Deepwater  Program  in 
jeopardy,  and  does  a  profound  disservice  to  the  brave  men  and 
women  of  the  Coast  Guard  who  desperately  require  these  re-
sources. 

As  for  the  allegations  of  stonewalling  and  finger-pointing  in  the 
IG’s  investigation,  I  will  introduce  legislation  that  directs  the  De-
partment  of  Homeland  Security  to  develop  an  audit  plan,  so  that 
the Inspector General would not be encumbered in his future work. 
It  is  simply  unacceptable  that  lack  of  clarity  in  the  Inspector  Gen-
eral’s authority should hamper investigations on such a critical na-
tional security program. 

The  reasons  we  need  to  improve,  and  perhaps  even  reform,  the 
Deepwater  process  are  rooted  in  the  urgency  for  modernizing  the 
Coast  Guard  fleet.  I  chaired  the  April  2004  budget  hearing,  when 
your  predecessor  brought  in  a  thin,  rusted  piece  of  metal  from  the 
hull  of  a  Coast  Guard  cutter  to  make  his  point  about  the  state  of

the  fleet.  It  has  been  almost  3  years,  and  those  decaying  vessels— 
some  up  to  64  years  old—are  still  patrolling  the  waters  off  our 
coast. 

But, despite the degrading conditions of its assets, just last year, 
the  Coast  Guard  responded  to  over  28,000  mariners  in  distress, 
and  stopped  more  than  140,000  tons  of  cocaine  from  reaching  our 
shores.  Clearly,  our  Nation  must  have  a  Coast  Guard  that  is 
equipped,  trained,  and  ready  to  meet  our  maritime  and  homeland 
security challenges. 

We have all had a chance to see firsthand the Coast Guard’s tre-
mendous dedication, as well as your outstanding leadership, Admi-
ral Allen, during Hurricane Katrina. And we will never forget that. 
And  I’ve  been  enormously  impressed  with  the  can-do  spirit  of  the 
Coast  Guard,  and  the  leadership  you  exhibited  during  Hurricane 
Katrina,  and  I  know  the  leadership  that  you  provide  now,  during 
this troubling period, for the Coast Guard. 

And I say all of this, because I do think it’s important, to under-
stand  what  went  wrong,  why  it  went  wrong,  and  how  we’re  going 
to  move  forward  in  the  best  way,  that’s  in  the  best  interest  of  the 
Coast  Guard,  for  our  national  homeland  security  interest,  for  the 
Congress,  and  for  the  taxpayer.  And  I  am  deeply  disturbed,  but 
we’ve  had  many  conversations  about  this.  But,  the  fact  that  we 
were  never  presented  with  any  indication  or  evidence  that  there 
were  serious  problems  with  the  National  Security  Cutter,  in  fact, 
the Coast Guard told me it was a success story. When my staff was 
down  there  at  the  shipyard,  in  October,  there  was  no  revelation 
whatsoever. 

I  say  all  of  this  because  as  we  move  forward  I  know  I  can  place 
my  trust  in  you,  Admiral  Allen—that  we  will  have  an  open  and 
transparent  relationship,  and  one  of  accountability,  regardless  of 
who  is  asking  these  questions.  It  is  so  important,  because  we’re 
talking  about  a  $24  billion  program,  and  assets  that  are  des-
perately needed, and the men and women of the Coast Guard des-
perately  deserve  them.  And  so,  I  say  that  knowing  that  we  will 
have  to  work  together  to  determine  what  is  the  best  way  forward, 
given the circumstances that we’re now confronting. 

So again, I thank you, Madam Chair, I thank you, Admiral Allen, 
Mr.  Skinner,  Mr.  Caldwell,  and  subsequent  panel,  for  all  that 
you’re  doing  to  making  contributions  to  ensure  that  this  is  a  pro-
gram that can somehow move forward in the way that’s consistent 
with the interests of this country. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Senator  Snowe,  and  thank  you 
for that statement, and your willingness to work on this issue, and 
again,  I  enjoyed  the  short  tenure  that  we’ve  had  in  working  to-
gether on this subcommittee. 

Senator Lautenberg, would you like to make a statement? 

STATEMENT OF THE HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Madam Chairman, I thank you very much 
for  holding  this  hearing,  and  as  I  look  around  this  table,  I  see  all 
the  states  that  have  enormous  connections  with  the  Coast  Guard, 
enormous dependence on the Coast Guard. We respect the men and 
women of the Coast Guard greatly. I have always been an admirer

of the Coast Guard’s leadership and courage, and their importance 
in  terms  of  protecting  us  from  all  kinds  of  ills.  However,  the  port-
folio of their responsibilities continues to expand, even as we short-
change their budgets. 

It’s  surprising,  Madam  Chairman,  when  we  look  at  the  setbacks 
that  we  have  here,  caused  by  lack  of  oversight  and  neglect  by  the 
Administration.  The  nearly  9  million  residents  of  my  home  state 
expect  the  Bush  Administration  to  be  smart  stewards  of  our  tax 
dollars,  but  I’m  concerned  that  they  failed  in  the  oversight  of  the 
Deepwater Program. 

And  it  fell  so  short  of  expectations.  The  Deepwater  contract, 
originally  projected  to  be  $17  billion,  with  final  delivery  slated  for 
2018,  has  since  blown  up.  The  figures  are  familiar  to  everybody. 
But  it’s  worth  repetition:  now  Deepwater  will  cost  more  than  $24 
billion, with 9 years longer to complete action. 

There’s a report that was done at the request of the Navy about 
what  our  sea  situation  might  be  in  the  latter  part  of  this  century. 
And  the  assignments  broaden  out  to  a  whole,  different  array  of 
things, including protecting our shores from refugees seeking high-
er  land,  and  seeking  faster  ships  and  improved  defense  readiness. 
The impact of this mess and delay, combined with the Administra-
tion’s under-staffing and under-funding of the Coast Guard, means 
the  men  and  women  of  the  Coast  Guard  don’t  have  the  tools  to  do 
their  jobs.  And  the  men,  women  and  children  of  America  are  not 
as safe as they should be. 

By  way  of  example,  if  we  look  at  the  HH–65  helicopter.  More 
powerful  engine,  they  can  carry  more  people—we  saw  these  heli-
copters and their crews in action during Hurricane Katrina. Every-
one was struck by the heroism of the Coast Guardsmen—the risks 
they  were  willing  to  take  to  help  others  by  taking  stranded  resi-
dents from rooftops. With more of these helicopters in service, more 
Americans might have been evacuated. 

So,  I  support  the  funding  for  Deepwater,  but  I  don’t  support  the 
complacency  that  has  been  exhibited  by  the  Administration  when 
it  comes  to  its  contracting  oversight.  And  I  saw  it  as  a  member  of 
the  Homeland  Security  and  Government  Affairs  Committee  when 
it had to do with Halliburton. We couldn’t get an oversight hearing 
there,  and  I  wrote  five  letters  requesting  one.  The  response  from 
leadership was that it would have been duplicative. 

So,  Madam  Chair,  once  again,  thank  you  for  delving  into  this 
problem.  It’s  one  that  we  must  solve,  not  only  for  our  protection, 
but also our consciences, as stewards. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. 
Senator Lott? 

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TRENT LOTT, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Senator  LOTT.  Thank  you,  Senator  Cantwell,  and  good  luck  to 
you  and  your  leadership  of  this  very  important  Subcommittee.  I 
look  forward  to  working  with  you,  as  Chair,  along  with  the  rest  of 
this subcommittee. 

As  was  just  observed  by  Senator  Lautenberg,  this  is  a  heavily- 
laden  Coast  Guard-dependent  subcommittee.  We  all  have  coast-
lines,  and  we  know  how  important  the  Coast  Guard  is,  so  I  think

this  is  a  very  appropriate  hearing.  Our  goal  is  to  work  with  the 
Coast  Guard  and  Department  of  Homeland  Security  to  upgrade 
and improve the Coast Guard’s capabilities across the board. Obvi-
ously, developing a National Security Cutter is a key component of 
that. 

Admiral  Allen,  I  also  thank  you  very  much  for  your  leadership 
of  the  Coast  Guard.  Thank  you  for  what  you  did  after  Hurricane 
Katrina,  when  you  helped  bring  order  out  of  a  lot  chaos  in  those 
states  that  were  hit  by  Katrina.  I’m  very  proud  to  see  you  in  the 
position you now have as Commandant of the Coast Guard. I have 
a lot of faith in you. 

With  regard  to  the  particular  issue  here,  I  think  it’s  important 
that we learn from you what has happened, and what you’re doing 
about  it,  and  what  your  goals  are.  And,  I  think  it’s  also  important 
we understand from the Deepwater contractors what really goes on 
in  a  program  like  this,  what  effort  is  underway  to  get  it  in  better 
shape,  and  to  correct  some  of  the  misunderstandings,  misinforma-
tion,  and  hyperbole  that  we  have  seen  in  some  of  the  news  media 
about what’s going on with the program. 

I  suspect  that  the  people  who  are  going  to  testify  on  this  panel, 
and the next one, know more about ships, ship conversion and cut-
ters  than  anybody  in  The  New  York  Times,  or  anybody  who  talks 
to  The  New  York  Times.  So,  I  hope  we  can  get  the  record  straight 
here today. 

Now,  I’ve  worked  with  this  program  for  years.  We  should  have 
started the Coast Guard’s asset replacement back in the 1990s, but 
we  didn’t.  And  then  when  we  started  moving  into  it.  The  original 
funding parameter was set at $500 million over 20 years, and was 
unrealistically  low.  So,  we  are  now  pushing  aggressively  to  catch 
up  with  replacing  these  aging  assets,  and  getting  modern  cutters. 
Not  being  realistic  in  time  or  cost  expectations  has  led  to  some  of 
the Deepwater Program’s problems. 

There’s no question that there have been some mistakes made in 
how this program has been managed. I also know from experience, 
in  working  with  the  Coast  Guard,  the  Navy  and  all  kind  of  ship-
builders  in  my  own  state  and  neighboring  states,  that  there  has 
never been a new ship class design that didn’t undergo some prob-
lems, some modifications, and some changes. In the case of the Na-
tional Security Cutter, changes were required as a result of the ad-
ditional  national  security  and  homeland  security  requirements 
after  September  11.  You  put  requirements  on  this  cutter  that  no-
body had originally anticipated. 

So,  there  are,  I  think,  some  legitimate  explanations  of  some  of 
the problems. There’s no question in my mind that the contractors 
have  got  to  do  a  better  job  of  working  with  the  Coast  Guard,  and 
that  the  Coast  Guard’s  contract  management  capabilities  need  to 
be improved. This is a big program. The Coast Guard doesn’t have 
a lot of experience with this size of vessel, or the number and cost 
of these vessels. 

Now, some people are saying, ‘‘Oh, we may need radical surgery, 
we need to cancel the Deepwater contract.’’ Do we want this cutter 
or  not?  Do  we  want  to  move  forward  and  modernize  the  Coast 
Guard  or  not?  Do  we  need  to  make  changes?  Yes.  But,  I  think  we 
need to be careful that we don’t do anything rash, which will wind

up  costing  more,  and  delaying—even  further—the  replacement  of 
an aging fleet with modern capability and technologies. 

Unfortunately,  I  have  a  commitment  that  I’m  going  to  have  to 
fulfill, so I won’t be here for the testimony. But I’m glad that we’re 
going to have the opportunity to hear from you, Admiral Allen, and 
from  the  contractors.  We’ll  have  a  better  understanding  of  what 
has  gone  on,  and  what’s  going  to  be  done  differently,  and  better, 
in the future. 

And thank you, Madam Chair, for allowing me to make this kind 

of statement. Thank you. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Lott. 
Senator Vitter? 

STATEMENT OF THE HON. DAVID VITTER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 

Senator VITTER. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
And, I also want to start by thanking Admiral Allen for his lead-
ership  after  Katrina  and  for  the  heroic  service  of  the  Coast  Guard 
immediately  after  Katrina,  actually  starting  during  parts  of 
Katrina.  There  were  choppers  in  the  air  during  the  significant 
winds, beginning to rescue people from their rooftops, so we deeply 
appreciate that. 

I, Madam Chair, have been a strong supporter of the Deepwater 
Program,  and  I’ll  continue  to  be,  because  of  the  need,  because  of 
the  absolute  necessity  of  developing  this  new  fleet.  But,  like  all  of 
the  Committee  members,  I’m  very  concerned  about  some  of  the 
problems  with  regard  to  the  patrol  boats  that  have  come  up.  And 
I’ll  obviously  get  to  questions  during  the  question  phase  of  the 
hearing. 

But,  two  things,  just  to  focus  our  witnesses  on  ahead  of  time. 
One of our shipbuilders in Louisiana who has been involved in this 
program is Bollinger Shipyards. Relatively early on in the process, 
when  they  were  beginning  to  work  on,  about,  the  fourth  hull,  they 
understood  that  this  conversion  really  wasn’t  working,  that  there 
were significant problems with it, because of the state of those very 
old  hulls,  and  they  made  a  specific  proposal  to  build  entirely  new 
hulls for $5 million each, versus this conversion, which was costing 
$4 million each, with unacceptable results. 

And  I’d  like  to  know  why  that  proposal  was  rejected,  and  why 
we’re  clearly  on  a  better  path,  because  what  was  eventually  done 
is significantly more expensive than that. 

And  second,  as  we  move  forward  with  this  new  bridge  strategy, 
I  am  concerned  about  this  push  to  develop  composite  hulls,  which 
isn’t  here  yet.  I  thought  one  of  the  fundamental  precepts  of  the 
Deepwater  Program  was  to  use  off-the-shelf  technology  in  a  fairly 
straightforward  way.  I  believe  this  focus  on  a  composite  hull  is 
completely  at  odds  with  that,  and  is  basically  mushrooming  this 
Deepwater  Program  into  an  R&D  program,  with  everything—in-
cluding much greater costs and unpredictabilities—that go hand-in- 
glove with that. 

So, I have some real concerns with that, as well as some concerns 
about  the  cost-benefit  comparison  between  steel  hulls  for  the  new 
FRCs  and  these  future,  hopeful,  composite  hulls.  So,  we’ll  get  into 
that later in a question. Thank you, Madam Chair.

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Vitter. 
Senator Kerry? 

STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator KERRY. Senator Cantwell, thank you very much. And it’s 
good  to  see  you  in  the  chair.  I’ve  had  the  pleasure  of  chairing  this 
Subcommittee before and I—— 

Senator CANTWELL. We thank you for that leadership. 
Senator KERRY. Well, it’s a great Subcommittee, and I’m pleased 

to be on this Subcommittee. 

Senator Klobuchar was, just a moment ago, claiming special sta-
tus  because,  I  think,  she’s  the  only  Member  here  who  has  a  state 
that isn’t actually on an ocean. We’ll have to see whether that’s fol-
lowed through on, or not. 

Madam Chairman, thank you for having this important meeting. 
I join my colleagues in expressing our enormous respect and admi-
ration  for  the  Coast  Guard,  and  the  work  they’ve  done,  and  are 
doing in all of our waters, and we’re grateful for that. 

The  Coast  Guard’s  Deepwater  Program—I’ve  been  on  this  com-
mittee now for, I guess, about 20 years—and I can remember when 
we  were  sitting  here  with  various  Coast  Guard  commandants 
pleading  for  money  for  the  Deepwater  capacity  for  the  Coast 
Guard. And we have been, literally, billions of dollars behind in our 
commitments  here  in  the  Congress  to  giving  the  Coast  Guard  the 
capacity that it both needs and deserves. And they’ve been working 
under very, very difficult circumstances, particularly with the aug-
mentation  of  drug  responsibilities,  which  came  significantly  in  the 
1980s, and also now, of course, port security. So, it’s a complicated 
equation without enough resourcing. 

Sadly, a structure has been created that isn’t working. The Coast 
Guard’s Deepwater Program has been plagued by poor engineering, 
by  lax  oversight,  and  cost  overruns  that  are  going  to  cost  the  tax-
payers billions of dollars. That’s the bottom line. 

The flawed management structure of the program—I believe it is 
a  flawed  management  structure—has  allowed  private  contractors, 
specifically  Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman,  to  make 
management  decisions  that  increased  their  bottom  lines  at  the  ex-
pense of taxpayers and national security. 

For instance, Lockheed-Northrop, which was supposed to open up 
subcontracts  to  competition,  instead  relied  on  its  own  subsidiaries 
for  much  of  the  work,  and  made  questionable  purchases,  including 
buying the wrong-sized computer consoles on the new National Se-
curity Cutters. 

It also changed the design of the cutter. I know there will be ar-
guments  about  9/11,  et  cetera,  but  the  bottom  line  is  that,  those 
changes will not allow it to operate for as long as the Coast Guard 
needs,  and  will  require  retro-fitting  totaling  as  much  as  $500  mil-
lion. 

When  the  current  Deepwater  contract  expires  in  June,  it  is  my 
judgment—I  know  there  will  be  some  difference  of  opinion  on  the 
Committee—but  it’s  my  judgment  that  the  Coast  Guard  ought  to 
drop  Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman,  and  hold  an  open, 
competitive  bidding  process,  in  which  they  could  of  course,  take 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

11 

part  in  under  appropriate  new  standards  with  a  competitive  bid-
ding  for  the  remaining  aspects  of  the  program,  while  simulta-
neously  ensuring  that  the  management  decisions  are  made  solely 
by the Coast Guard. 

The  Coast  Guard  should  also  explore  every  legal  avenue  to  re-
coup  funding  from  Lockheed-Northrop  that  it  spent  on  poorly  de-
signed ships. 

Now,  if  I  might  say,  I  heard  Senator  Lott  talk  about  The  New 
York Times, and what is accurate or not accurate here. I’m not re-
lying  on  The  New  York  Times,  though  it  raises  serious  questions. 
But,  the  Inspector  General—and  we  have  the  pleasure  of  having 
him  here—has  said  in  his  report,  that  as  of  November  16,  2006, 
‘‘the  combined  cost  of  NSCs  1  and  2  has  increased  from  $517  mil-
lion,  to  approximately  $775  million,’’  representing  a  50  percent  in-
crease in cost over the original contract prices. Primarily, from the 
NSC design changes, but other government-requested items not in-
cluded in the original contract price also add to that. 

It also appears now, according to the Inspector General, that the 
cost of NSCs 1 and 2 will increase beyond the current $775 million, 
because  that  figure  does  not  include  the  $302  million  request  for 
equitable  adjustments  submitted  to  the  Coast  Guard  by  ICGS  in 
2005. 

So,  there  are  very  serious  questions.  Also,  the  current  $775  mil-
lion  estimate  does  not  include  the  cost  of  structural  modifications 
to  correct  design  deficiencies,  in  either  NCS  1—which  has  already 
been  constructed—or  NSC  2—which  is  being  constructed—and  it 
doesn’t  include  any  costs  related  to  structural  modifications  to  be 
made to NSCs 3 through 8 to correct these design deficiencies. 

So,  in  my  judgment,  you  know,  what  we’re  really  looking  at, 
Madam Chairman, is the—you know, there is a definite connection 
here  between  cost  increases  and  contractor  decisions,  that  weren’t 
overseen properly because of the management structure that exists. 
I think that has got to be changed, that it’s our responsibility to 
change  it,  to  protect  the  taxpayers,  and  also,  frankly,  to  leverage 
the Coast Guard’s ability to be able to make the management deci-
sions  that  it  ought  to  be  making  with  respect  to  these  cutters.  It’s 
just  an  insidious  situation,  where  you  have  this  current  construct 
where  management,  without  oversight,  without  the  Coast  Guard 
decision, can fundamentally augment its bottom line at the expense 
of the taxpayer, without providing increased defense security or in-
creased capacity to the Coast Guard. That’s just insulting, to all of 
us. 

Frankly,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  has  dropped  the 
ball  on  behalf  of  the  American  taxpayer  with  respect  to  this, 
whether  it’s  buying  seaport  radiation  monitors  that  can’t  tell  the 
difference  between  a  bomb  or  a  banana,  or  issuing  inflated,  no-bid 
Katrina  clean-up  contracts,  a  lot  of  contractors  have  been  feeding 
at  the  public  trough,  while  failing  to  adequately  defend  our  inter-
ests. 

So,  I  think  we  need  to  put  an  end  to  that  lax  oversight,  and  to 
the  business-as-usual  approach,  and  make  common  sense  choices 
that  provide  accountability  where  it  ought  to  be,  create  manage-
ment power where it ought to be, and protect our ability to go for-
ward  here  with  a  contract  that  is  appropriately  managed—not  by

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you,  Chairwoman  Cantwell,  for 
bringing us here together to do our job, to ask the tough questions, 
and to push for smart, effective solutions. 

As Senator Kerry noted, I am the Senator on this Subcommittee 
without an ocean. Senator Lautenberg suggested that I come to the 
Senate  and  ask  for  an  ocean  for  Minnesota,  but  since  we  already 
have 10,000 lakes, we don’t need one. 

But we do have one very large lake, which, I think that Admiral 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Can  you  wait  until  we  fix  this  problem,  and 

Allen, you’re familiar with. 

then you can—— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  That  would  be  Lake  Superior,  and  Duluth, 
Minnesota is the home port of a Coast Guard cutter that’s charged 
with ice-breaking, law enforcement, search and rescue, and aids to 
navigation.  Duluth  is  also  home  to  a  Marine  Safety  Unit,  that  co-
ordinates  maritime  safety,  security,  and  protection  of  natural  re-
sources from the North all along the Canadian border. 

And, as a former prosecutor, I know there’s nothing more impor-
tant  than  protecting  the  security  of  our  country  and  our  people, 
and the Coast Guard has an important role in that with our state. 
I’d also note that the Coast Guard also aids the navigation of our 
cargo  ships  carrying  ore,  coal  and  grain,  and  is  very  helpful  in 
breaking the ice in the wintertime. 

And,  I  will  say,  as  proud  as  we  are  of  the  work  of  the  Coast 
Guard,  Senator  Kerry  has  raised  some  good  points,  as  have  other 
Senators,  about  recent  reports  that  have  raised  serious  questions 
about  the  specific  acquisitions  under  the  program,  as  well  as  the 
more  fundamental  problems  going  on  with  contracting,  and  the 
like.  And  I  believe  it’s  important  to  explore  those  questions,  and 
while  I’m  not  going  to  be  able  to  stay  for  the  entire  hearing  here, 
I want you to know that we will continue to ask those tough ques-
tions,  and  also  know  that  we  in  Minnesota  are  proud  of  the  work 
that the Coast Guard does. 

Thank you. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. 
We’ll  go  to  our  first  panel,  and  I’m  going  to  ask  Admiral  Allen 
for  you  to  start,  and  again,  thank  you,  and  Mr.  Skinner,  and  Mr. 
Caldwell, for being here today. 

Admiral Allen?

U.S. COAST GUARD, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
Admiral  ALLEN.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair,  Ranking  Member 
Snowe,  and  the  members  of  the  Committee.  I’m  happy  to  be  here

I’m glad that we all agree on one thing, Madam Chair, and that 
the number one goal—at least as far as I’m concerned—is to convey 
the critical importance of re-capitalizing aging Coast Guard cutters, 
aircraft, and sensors. 

And,  I  agree  also,  Deepwater  is  essential  to  the  future  of  Amer-
ica’s  Coast  Guard.  We  do  not  have  the  luxury  to  restart  this  pro-
gram.  Last  week  we  decommissioned  the  Cutter  STORIS,  after  64 
years of service, only to have her replaced by the ACUSHNET, the 
next oldest cutter, at only 63 years. 

Our  aging  platforms  cannot  sustain  the  level  of  operations  re-
quired  in  the  current  threat  environment.  Each  year  the  new  cut-
ters and aircraft are delayed, we lose more mission hours, and our 
capability  is  eroded  by  failing,  or  unsustainable  equipment.  We 
have to get this right, and we have to do it quickly. 

Getting it right means several things. First, internally the Coast 
Guard must create the right organization and culture, that focuses 
on effective management and contract oversight. We are doing that. 
When  I  was  interviewed  to  be  Commandant  by  Secretary 
Chertoff,  over  a  year  ago,  I  understood  what  needed  to  be  done 
with  this  program.  I  proposed  a  single  acquisition  organization  to 
improve program management, and then to align that organization 
with a new service-wide mission support structure. 

Yesterday, in my annual State of the Coast Guard address, I out-
lined my plan to restructure our command and control, and mission 
support  systems.  Deepwater  will  benefit  from  this,  included  is  a 
Blueprint  for  Acquisition  Reform,  and  we’ve  already  begun  to  im-
plement it. 

I  have  clearly  defined  the  role  of  the  Assistant  Commandant  for 
Engineering  Logistics,  my  chief  engineer,  as  the  Coast  Guard’s 
technical  authority  for  acquisitions  and  a  directive  to  all  Coast 
Guard personnel. 

I’ve  assigned  Admiral  Ron  Rabago  to  lead  the  Deepwater  Pro-
gram  office.  Admiral  Rabago  is  a  distinguished  Naval  Engineer 
with  29  years  of  service,  a  former  cutter  commanding  officer,  and 
former commanding officer of the Coast Guard Yard. 

We  have  sought  an  external,  independent  assessment  of  our  ac-
quisition  process  from  the  Defense  Acquisition  University—we  re-
quested  it—and  have  received  a  number  of  recommendations  that 
we  are  reviewing.  This  assessment  endorses  our  Blueprint  for  Ac-
quisition Reform. 

I also personally asked Comptroller General David Walker, to re-
view our acquisition reform, and will commend this action for Com-
mittee sponsorship, as well. 

Second,  we  must  collaborate  effectively  with  our  industry  part-
ners,  and  when  appropriate,  provide  the  direction  that  preserves 
the government’s interest, and ensures the performance of our cut-
ters and aircraft. We are doing that. 

Since  assuming  my  duties  as  Commandant,  I’ve  met  frequently 
with  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  of  Lockheed  Martin,  and  Nor-
throp Grumman. They are both committed, as am I, to getting this 
done  right.  We  will  adjust  the  terms  of  the  contract  going  forward 
to  ensure  proper  emphasis  on  cost  control,  competition,  and  pro-
gram  management.  Our  Coast  Guard  technical  authority  will  lead

our efforts in systems integration, both in an oversight role, and as 
the integrator, when required. 

I’ve  also  met  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy,  the  Deputy  Sec-
retary of Defense, and the Chief of Naval Operations. Each has of-
fered their support. To the extent that we can leverage their capa-
bilities  and  expertise  to  do  this  smarter,  and  more  effectively,  we 
will. 

Third,  we  must  maintain  cordial,  productive  relationships  with 
oversight bodies that have legitimate roles in this endeavor. We are 
doing  that.  To  the  extent  that  we  can  improve,  or  provide  better 
guidance to our people, we will do that as well. 

I  have  sent  a  personal  message  to  every  person  in  the  Coast 
Guard  that  includes  the  following  statement:  ‘‘External  scrutiny 
from the Inspector General and other overseers will raise questions 
on  the  Deepwater  acquisitions  throughout  its  life.  As  public  serv-
ants,  we  are  not  only  subject  to  their  oversight,  but  it  is  a  central 
feature of the appropriations process. I welcome external review, as 
it  enables  us  to  improve  our  processes,  be  more  effective  stewards 
of  taxpayer  dollars,  and  better  serve  the  American  public.  I  have 
met regularly with the Inspector General. To the extent that there 
is  any  ambiguity  regarding  our  position  on  the  NSC  audit,  let  me 
clearly state that we concur, and have implemented, five of the six 
recommendations  made.  Regarding  the  sixth  and 
final  rec-
ommendation, we are deferring to the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to establish department-wide policy where appropriate.’’ 

In the past 10 years, the Coast Guard has acquired a number of 
assets—on  schedule,  and  below  estimated  cost.  Examples  include 
our  coastal  patrol  boat,  our  large  buoy  tenders,  and  the  Great 
Lakes Icebreaker. However, in each case, the acquisition was a sin-
gle-platform, and systems integration was not a challenge. 

Our challenge now is to transform our demonstrated competency 
as  a  mid-sized  Federal  agency  to  one  capable  of  effectively  man-
aging  a  large,  complex,  systems  integration  contract,  like  Deep-
water.  And  while  there’s  a  current  focus  on  two  specific  cutters,  it 
should be recognized that Deepwater continues to provide new and 
valuable  capability  in  the  form  of  new  fixed-wing  aircraft,  vastly 
capable  helicopters,  and  significant  upgrades  to  our  legacy  cutters. 
I  have  flown  in  our  helicopters,  I  have  ridden  our  cutters  on  pa-
trol  in  the  Caribbean.  Our  people  appreciate  these  tools—that  re-
mains the promise of Deepwater. We acknowledge there are issues 
related  to  the  fatigue-life  of  the  National  Security  Cutter.  We 
should  also  acknowledge  that  this  is  the  most  capable  cutter  we 
have ever provided to our people. 

This program must move forward, and it is my responsibility, not 
only  to  get  it  right,  but  to  demonstrate  to  the  Committee  that  the 
Coast  Guard  has  the  capability,  capacity  and  competency  to  man-
age  the  re-capitalization  of  our  fleet.  The  changes  that  have  been 
occurring in the Coast Guard on my watch, and those to come, are 
opening  focused  on  mission  execution.  This  is  not  what  Admiral 
Allen wants, it’s what the country needs from its Coast Guard. 

I’d be happy to answer any questions. 
[The prepared statement of Admiral Allen follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN, COMMANDANT, 

U.S. COAST GUARD, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

Introduction 

Good  afternoon,  Madam  Chair,  and  distinguished  members  of  the  Subcommittee. 
It is an honor to be here today to discuss the state of the Integrated Deepwater Sys-
tem,  its  recent  milestones  and  challenges,  and  provide  you  with  a  look  at  the  way 
ahead. 

Our  ability  to  save  lives,  interdict  drug  and  alien  smugglers,  and  protect  ports, 
waterways and natural resources depends on our having the best-trained people op-
erating  a  modern,  state-of-the-art  fleet.  The  Deepwater  Program  has  and  will  con-
tinue to provide America with more capable, interoperable assets that will close to-
day’s  operational  gaps  and  enable  the  Coast  Guard  to  perform  its  demanding  mis-
sions more effectively, efficiently and safely. Deepwater remains my capital priority 
and  I  greatly  appreciate  all  that  this  Subcommittee  has  done  to  move  the  program 
forward. 

I  am  also  grateful  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  in  detail  Deepwater  issues  re-
cently covered in the national media. Some of the stories spoke factually to program 
challenges that genuinely merit further attention. It is my goal this morning to pro-
vide  you  the  facts  and  reassure  you  of  my  absolute  commitment  to  sound  steward-
ship, robust oversight and the corrective actions I’ve taken to outfit our fleet to meet 
21st century threats and requirements. We have to get this right: the Coast Guard’s 
future readiness depends on it. America depends on it. 
Past as Prologue 

Before  I  discuss  the  current  state  of  Deepwater  and  the  program’s  way  ahead,  I 
ask  you  to  bear  with  me  briefly  to  consider  how  we  got  here.  By  the  mid  1990s, 
most  of  our  ships  and  aircraft  were  approaching  the  end  of  their  service  lives.  Our 
cutter fleet was then, and remains, one of the oldest among the world’s naval fleets. 
Some  of  our  cutters  are  old  enough  to  be  eligible  for  Social  Security!  In  light  of  a 
looming block fleet obsolescence, it wasn’t sensible to attempt piecemeal, one-for-one 
replacement of each class of assets. We also didn’t have the capacity to manage that 
many projects in parallel. 

Because of these anticipated challenges, we knew an innovative approach was re-
quired.  And  because  maritime  threats  were  evolving  in  the  post-Cold  War  environ-
ment  in  which  Deepwater  was  conceived,  we  knew  expectations  for  maritime  secu-
rity  were  changing  as  well,  so  our  asset  mix  would  need  to  support  these  dynamic 
requirements. We determined, therefore, that it would be most cost effective and ef-
ficient to acquire a wholly-integrated system of ships, aircraft, sensors and commu-
nications  systems,  or,  as  it  is  commonly  called,  a  ‘‘system  of  systems.’’  The  idea  is 
based  on  the  concept  that  the  whole  is  greater  than  the  sum  of  its  parts;  all  ele-
ments combine to generate greater capabilities across the entire system. Given that, 
our goal is not to replace ships, aircraft, and sensors with more ships, aircraft, and 
sensors, but to provide the Coast Guard with the functional capabilities required to 
safely achieve mission success.

This  wholly-integrated  acquisition  strategy  called  for  progressive  modernization, 
conversion  and  recapitalization  using  a  mix  of  new  and  legacy  assets,  replacing 
those that are obsolete, while upgrading existing ones until a new fleet is acquired. 
This  complex  strategy,  and  the  fact  that  the  Coast  Guard  had  not  built  a  ship  the 
size  of  the  National  Security  Cutter  for  over  three  decades,  drove  our  decision  to 
engage the services of a system integrator with proven technical expertise in the ac-
quisition of large systems. Following a rigorous, multiple year selection process, the 
result  was  our  contract  with  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  (ICGS),  a  joint  ven-
ture of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. 

Adding  to  the  program’s  complexity  was  adoption  of  an  innovative  performance- 
based  acquisition  strategy.  Compared  to  more  traditional  methods,  performance- 
based acquisition is designed to promote innovation and spread risk more evenly be-
tween government and industry. 

Following nearly 10 years of planning, beginning in 1993, the Coast Guard moved 
toward contract award believing that we had addressed many of the concerns likely 
to  arise  from  this  transformational  strategy.  We  understood  there  would  be  chal-
lenges,  but  we  never  expected  the  larger  challenge  that  lay  ahead  for  the  Coast 
Guard  and  the  Nation  in  the  wake  of  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001. 
Following  the  Service’s  transfer  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  in  March 
2003,  we  conducted  a  Performance  Gap  Analysis,  drafted  a  new  Mission  Needs 
Statement, and developed a revised, post-9/11 Implementation Plan to ensure Deep-
water capabilities would support new mission sets assigned to the Coast Guard. All 
of  these  steps  were  carried  out  in  full  consultation  with  the  Administration  and 
Congress. As Deepwater requirements were expanded in the post-9/11 environment, 
the program’s timeline expanded and its overall projected cost grew from $17 to $24 
billion. 
Where We Are Today in Deepwater 

It  is  important  to  remember  that  we  are  in  the  early  stages  of  a  25-year  acquisi-
tion. As is typical, much of the early years of contract execution was focused on de-
sign  and  development  work,  and  we  have  obligated  only  about  15  percent  of  what 
we  project  to  be  the  total  program  cost.  However,  our  Fiscal  Year  2007  appropria-
tion  of  $1.06  billion  supports  the  program’s  ongoing  progress,  and  I  thank  you  for 
your  continued  investment  in  these  critically  needed  assets  that  are  beginning  to 
make a difference today.

Despite  the  challenges  that  Deepwater  has  experienced,  the  Coast  Guard  has 

been the beneficiary of significant program accomplishments, including: 

• command,  control  and  sensor  (C4ISR)  upgrades  to  all  39  medium  and  high  en-
durance  cutters  and  at  Communications  Area  Master  Station  Atlantic 
(CAMSLANT); 

• the December 2006 arrival of our first new HC–144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft, 
currently undergoing installation of mission pallets in Elizabeth City, NC, to be 
followed  shortly  by  delivery  and  missionization  of  the  second  and  third  air-
frames; 

• commencement  of  our  HC–130J  missionization  program,  with  scheduled  first 

delivery in 2007; 

• upcoming  ribbon  cutting  ceremonies  for  new  Deepwater  shore  facilities,  includ-
ing  a  surface  ship  training  center  in  Petaluma,  California,  and  a  hangar  to 
house HC–144As in Mobile, Alabama; and 

• continuation of the Mission Effectiveness Programs for 110′ patrol boats and for 
270′  and  210′  medium  endurance  cutters,  projects  funded  by  Deepwater  and 
managed by the Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate. 

Additional  milestones  include  the  launch  and  christening  last  fall  of  the  first  of 
eight  planned  National  Security  Cutters,  along  with  the  keel  authentication  cere-
mony  for  the  second,  which  fittingly  took  place  on  September  11,  2006.  These  par-
ticular  achievements  in  shipbuilding  are  especially  noteworthy  in  light  of  the  im-

pacts of the 2005 hurricane season when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita came ashore 
along the Gulf Coast, upending lives, severely damaging shipbuilding facilities, and 
further challenging the program. Construction of the NSCs continues and we appre-
ciate  the  efforts  of  shipyard  workers  and  Coast  Guard  men  and  women  in  keeping 
production of these important vessels moving forward. I firmly believe the NSC will 
provide a great contribution to the Coast Guard and the Nation. 

Eighty-four  of  95  HH–65  helicopters  will  have  been  re-engined  and  converted  to 
Charlie models by June 2007, enabling operators to routinely perform missions they 
could  not  have  attempted  before,  including  remaining  aloft  for  longer  periods  and 
having  the  ability  to  carry  greater  loads  as  was  demonstrated  during  Hurricane 
Katrina rescues. 

The Coast Guard and ICGS, Deepwater’s systems integrator, are leveraging sound 
principles of systems engineering and integration to derive high levels of sub-system 
and component commonality, improve interoperability with the U.S. Navy and other 
agencies,  and  achieve  significant  cost  avoidances  and  savings.  This  approach  con-
forms with and directly supports the National Fleet Policy. 

Beginning  in  2002,  the  Program  Executive  Officer  of  Deepwater  formalized  a  col-
laborative  partnership  with  his  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  counterparts  in  order  to 
identify  common  systems,  technologies  and  processes  for  improved  interoperability. 
By  incorporating  common  and  interoperable  Navy  systems  into  Deepwater  assets, 
the Coast Guard has also avoided paying unnecessary costs. 

As examples, the National Security Cutter and Offshore Patrol Cutter will use 75 
percent of the Navy’s AEGIS Command and Decision System. Deepwater assets also 
will  incorporate  Navy  Type/Navy  Owned  systems,  including  the  57-mm  deck  gun, 
selected  for  major  Deepwater  cutters  and  the  Navy’s  Littoral  Combat  Ship  and 
DD(X)  programs.  The  Operation  Center  Consoles  on  the  NSC  use  70  percent  of  the 
design  of  the  Navy’s  Display  Systems  (AN/UYQ–70).  And,  by  using  more  than 
23,000 lines of software code from the Navy’s Antisubmarine Warfare Improvement 
Program  (AIP)  in  the  CASA  Maritime  Patrol  Aircraft’s  command  and  control  sys-
tems, we are maximizing the use of mission systems that are installed on more than 
95 percent of the world’s maritime surveillance aircraft. The CASA Maritime Patrol 
Aircraft will utilize more than 50 percent of the functionality of the Navy’s P–3 AIP 
system.  Navy  and  Coast  Guard  personnel  even  train  side-by-side  at  the  Coast 
Guard’s training facility in Petaluma, California. 

We  work  closely  with  the  Navy’s  Operational  Test  and  Evaluation  Force 
(COMOPTEVFOR). Currently, the Naval Air Systems Command staff is assisting us 
in  evaluating  the  way  ahead  for  Deepwater’s  VUAV  project.  We  routinely  rely  on 
the  expertise  of  Naval  Sea  Systems  Command  for  a  variety  of  assessments.  Per-
sonnel  from  the  Navy  Supervisor  of  Shipbuilding  Office  (SUPSHIP)  are  assigned  to 
our  Program  Management  Resident  Office  (PMRO)  in  Pascagoula,  MS,  where  they 
are supporting construction of the NSC at Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. 

Looking  to  the  future,  there  are  many  other  opportunities  for  the  Coast  Guard 
and Navy to build on today’s rich partnership in the design and delivery of the Na-
tional  Fleet  in  support  of  the  National  Strategy  for  Maritime  Security.  Potential 
areas  for  future  cooperation  include  the  design  of  the  Offshore  Patrol  Cutter,  un-
manned aerial vehicles, and common systems for weapons, sensors, and propulsion. 
Evaluations of sub-systems should include both the equipment and crewing support 
(e.g., crew composition aligned with capabilities required for a deployment). The col-
laborative development of LCS mission modules for coastal surveillance and port se-
curity  missions  also  offers  the  potential  for  greater  partnership  in  an  operational 
mission area shared by both services.

Challenges in Program Execution 

The innovative Deepwater program is large and complex and we have faced some 
challenges.  Our  performance-based  acquisition  strategy  has  created  unique  con-
tracting  and  management  challenges  for  the  Coast  Guard  and  our  industry  part-
ners. In my view, some of these come from the need for an integrated Coast Guard, 
that unifies our technical authority, requirements owner, and our acquirers in a way 
that  allows  early  and  efficient  adjudication  of  problems  and  ensures  transparency 
so  that  Coast  Guard  would  be  capable  of  working  successfully  with  ICGS  on  a  si-
multaneous and complex acquisition of this size. We knew early on that this acquisi-
tion would be transformational for our Service, but we have to actively manage that 
transformation  and  not  allow  this  acquisition  to  manage  us.  We  are  aggressively 
tackling and correcting these problems. 

And  clearly,  we  have  experienced  some  failures  in  the  Deepwater  Program.  The 
planned  conversion  of  110-foot  patrol  boats  to  123  feet  as  a  bridging  strategy  until 
new  assets  came  online  to  fill  the  patrol  gap  has  failed.  Early  on,  we  experienced 
hull  problems  with  the  first  eight  patrol  boats  that  had  been  converted  and  halted 
the project in May 2005. Technical problems continued in spite of multiple attempts 
at repair. 

Last  November,  new  problems  were  discovered,  and  I  made  the  decision  to  sus-
pend  operation  of  our  123-foot  patrol  boats  until  we  determine  whether  a  technical 
fix  is  possible  and  economically  prudent.  Removing  these  boats  from  service  was  a 
difficult decision and has added to our critical gap in patrol boat hours. I know that 
this  is  of  great  concern  to  each  of  you.  I  assure  you  that  I,  too,  am  concerned—my 
highest priority is to mitigate and fill this gap as quickly as possible with the most 
capable assets.

To  that  end,  I  have  directed  my  senior  staff  to  aggressively  examine  and  rec-
ommend  ways  we  can  use  current  resources  to  mitigate  the  loss  of  the  123-foot  pa-
trol boats. In response and as partial mitigation of the impact, we: 
• began multi-crewing eight of our existing 110-foot patrol boats; 
• increased their operational tempo; 
• redeployed and surged assets to areas of greatest need, based upon risk; 
• secured continued use of three PC–179s from the Navy; 
• are  aggressively  examining  the  purchase  of  additional  87-foot  patrol  boats;  and 
• are compressing the 110′ WPB Mission Effectiveness Project (MEP) schedule to 

reduce operational impacts. 

The  Coast  Guard  will  do  whatever  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  our  maritime  bor-

ders are secure and we can respond to existing and emergent requirements. 

The  failure  of  the  123-foot  patrol  boat  project  is  unacceptable.  I  have  established 
a  group  of  legal,  contracting,  and  engineering  experts  to  examine  the  process  at  all 
stages,  from  beginning  design  work  until  we  tied  up  the  boats.  I  have  directed  this 
group  to  establish  responsibility  and  propose  measures  to  prevent  similar  problems 
in the future. We will work aggressively with ICGS to reach resolution and put this 
behind us. 

When  problems  arose  with  the  123-foot  patrol  boats,  the  Coast  Guard  realized  a 
need for additional patrol boats sooner than the original plan called for. After exam-
ining  a  series  of  options,  we  decided  to  move  construction  of  the  FRC  forward  on 
the  overall  Deepwater  timeline.  However,  early  tank  testing  showed  technical  risks 
with  the  initial  FRC  composite  hull  design;  prudence  required  suspending  the  de-
sign and development while we considered the way ahead. 

Ultimately, we decided to implement a ‘‘dual path’’ approach to acquire a fully ca-
pable patrol boat while expediting delivery. First, we took a step back from the ini-
tial FRC design to more thoroughly examine both its design and the composite hull 
technology  that  the  design  incorporated.  We  are  completing  a  bottom-up  business 
case  analysis  on  what  we  have  termed  the  ‘‘FRC–A  Class’’  to  provide  an  ‘‘apples  to 
apples’’  look  at  composite  versus  steel  hulls.  Results  from  this  analysis  should  be 
available  later  this  month.  Additionally,  we  had  a  technology  readiness  assessment 
performed to review critical technology elements associated with a composite-hulled 
design.  Initial  findings  from  this  assessment  indicate  that  necessary  critical  tech-
nology  elements  do  not  yet  support  immediate  production  of  a  composite-hulled  pa-
trol boat.

Clearly with this design review, the FRC–A Class path doesn’t get boats into the 
fleet  as  quickly  as  needed.  As  an  interim  solution,  the  Coast  Guard  is  simulta-
neously working to acquire a ‘‘parent craft’’ design based on a vessel already in oper-
ation; one that will require minimal modifications to meet our basic mission require-
ments.  We  call  this  our  Replacement  Patrol  Boat  or  ‘‘FRC–B  Class.’’  After  a  good, 
hard  look  at  the  market  to  determine  whether  adequate  boats  exist  to  support  a 
parent  craft  approach,  we  issued  a  Request  for  Proposal  for  such  a  vessel  to  ICGS. 
We expect a design proposal no later than March 31st of this year that will support 
delivery of the first FRC–B Class in the first half of FY 2010. 

Turning  to  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC),  I  would  like  to  clarify  reports  of 
structural  problems.  The  DHS  OIG  recently  concluded  an  audit  of  the  NSC  which 
highlighted concerns with our approach to potential structural integrity issues with 
the NSC hull. The issue here, which we have communicated to DHS OIG and which 
we have been actively addressing for several years, is a question of fatigue-life over 
the  course  of  the  cutter’s  30-year  service  life.  There  has  never  been  a  question  of 
safety  related  to  the  ship’s  structure,  nor  have  we  ever  anticipated  any  operational 
restrictions  related  to  its  design.  As  you  are  well  aware,  we  drive  our  ships  hard, 
so service and fatigue-life of new cutters is of critical concern to us. 

An  early  Coast  Guard  review  of  the  design  of  the  NSC  indicated  that  the  ship 
might experience fatigue-level stresses sooner than anticipated. Because we want to 
ensure that all of our ships meet the service and fatigue-life requirements our mis-
sions demand, we are implementing changes and enhancements to the design of the 
NSC.

Some  have  wondered  why  we  didn’t  suspend  construction  of  the  first  NSC  when 
we  learned  of  these  concerns.  The  Coast  Guard’s  decision  to  continue  production  of 
the NSC reflects more than simply the naval engineering perspective. They also en-
compass considerations of cost, schedule, and performance. After extensive research 
and  deliberation  and  with  all  of  these  considerations  in  mind,  the  Coast  Guard  de-
cided  that  the  need  for  enhancements  to  NSC  #1  could  be  effectively  addressed  by 
later retrofits and did not justify the schedule and cost risk associated with stopping 
the  production  line.  These  kinds  of  issues  are  not  unusual  in  production  of  a  first- 
in-class vessel, and I believe the decision to move forward was prudent. We will fix 
NSC #1 and 2 and design the fix into future hulls’ production.

To minimize future delays and disruption resulting from these kinds of design and 

technical concerns, I: 

• reaffirmed  in  writing  the  role  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  chief  engineer  as  the  tech-

nical authority for all acquisition projects; 

• directed  independent,  third-party  design  reviews  as  new  assets  are  developed 

or major modifications to assets are contemplated; and 

• am  working  to  expand  our  relationship  with  the  Naval  Sea  and  Air  Systems 

Commands to leverage outside technical expertise. 

We’ve learned from this experience. Adjudication of technical concerns within the 
Coast Guard could have been accomplished more efficiently. Existing organizational 
barriers made it harder for us to jointly address concerns and develop mutually ac-
ceptable solutions. We also could have been more proactive in informing Congress— 
and  this  Subcommittee—about  fatigue  concerns.  One  of  my  axioms  is  that  ‘‘trans-
parency  of  information  breeds  self-correcting  behavior;’’  I  assure  you  that  as  we 
move forward that transparency will be my watchword. 
The Way Ahead 

The Deepwater Program Executive Officer, Rear Admiral Gary Blore, has already 
undertaken a number of independent reviews, including the comprehensive business 
case  analysis  and  technology  readiness  assessment  for  the  FRC–A  Class  just  men-
tioned.  Of  particular  note,  we  contracted  with  the  Defense  Acquisition  University 
(DAU)  in  2006  to  conduct  a  ‘‘quick-look’’  review  of  Deepwater  to  examine  the  pro-
gram’s  key  management  and  technical  processes,  performance-based  acquisition 
strategy,  organizational  structure  and  our  government/industry  ‘‘partnership’’  con-
tract.  The  USCG  Research  and  Development  Center  is  conducting  a  study  and  will 
provide  recommendations  for  the  way  ahead  on  the  planned  Deepwater  Vertical- 
Launch  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle  (VUAV),  and  we’ve  initiated  an  independent  re-
view  of  workload  and  workforce  management  issues.  Based  on  these  findings  and 
recommendations,  we  will  make  ‘‘course  corrections’’  where  needed  in  order  to  lead 
an  efficient  organization  and  guarantee  successful  execution  of  the  Deepwater  Pro-
gram. 

As  I  mentioned  earlier,  many  of  the  challenges  within  the  Deepwater  Program 
stem  from  the  lack  of  an  integrated  Coast  Guard  acquisition  program  to  manage 
this  system-of-systems  acquisition,  as  well  as  to  conduct  effective  oversight  of  Inte-
grated Coast Guard Systems. We have developed an initial Blueprint for Acquisition

Reform, and in the coming months, you will see significant changes inside the Coast 
Guard’s acquisition directorate to bring all acquisition efforts—traditional as well as 
system-of-systems—under  one  organization.  Rear  Admiral  Blore  will  become  the 
Coast  Guard’s  Chief  Acquisition  Officer,  with  responsibility  over  all  procurement 
projects. The Program Executive Officer for Deepwater will work within the new or-
ganization.  I  have  directed  Rear  Admiral  Ron  Rabago,  a  naval  engineer,  former 
Commanding Officer of the Coast Guard Yard, and a technical expert on naval engi-
neering issues to take Deepwater’s ‘‘helm.’’ Consolidating our acquisition efforts will 
provide immediate benefits, including better allocation of contracting officers and ac-
quisition professionals, and an integrated product line approach to our management 
of acquisitions, thereby allowing projects to be handled by the same people, with the 
same expertise and the same linkages to the technical authorities. 

Additional  efforts  are  underway  within  Deepwater  and  the  Coast  Guard  to  de-
velop more appropriate staffing in order to efficiently obligate program funding and 
ensure successful delivery of needed assets to the fleet. We’re reinvigorating our ac-
quisition training and certification process to ensure that Deepwater staff, program 
managers and contracting officers have the requisite skills and education needed to 
manage  this  complex  program.  Our  desired  end-state  is  to  become  the  model  for 
mid-sized  Federal  agency  acquisition  and  procurement,  in  full  alignment  with  the 
Department of Homeland Security acquisition activities. 

DAU’s recent Quick Look Study of the Deepwater program concluded that our ini-
tial  Blueprint  for  Acquisition  Reform  ‘‘is  comprehensive  and  responsive  to  the 
human  capital,  organization,  process  and  governance-related  findings  and  rec-
ommendations’’ in its report. 
Cost Change and Contractor Oversight 

In discussing these challenges and my actions to address them, I need to mention 
two  concerns  raised  in  recent  media  coverage  of  the  Deepwater  program:  the  first 
is  cost  growth;  the  second  is  contract  oversight.  Much  of  what  has  been  reported 
in  the  press  as  ‘‘cost  overruns’’  simply  does  not  tell  the  full  story.  There  is  obvious 
truth  to  claims  of  programmatic  cost  increases.  As  noted,  the  original  Deepwater 
plan  was  estimated  to  cost  $17  billion  and  now  we’re  projecting  a  $24  billion  cost 
over 25 years. However, it is imperative to understand that the main driver of these 
cost  increases  was  the  complete  revision  of  the  original  plan  to  meet  post-9/11  mis-
sion  requirements.  New  missions  meant  that  we  needed  more  capable  assets  which 
cost more to acquire and build. 

In addition to improved mission capabilities, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the 
Gulf  Coast  shipyard  industry  hard  during  production  of  the  first  National  Security 
Cutter,  flooding  the  hull  and  causing  extensive  damage  to  the  facility.  The  impacts 
to industry—even just in terms of rebuilding a skilled, sufficient workforce—should 
not  be  underestimated.  The  tragedy  was  real  (I  can  personally  attest  to  this)  and 
contributed  to  cost  increases  and  some  schedule  slippage  for  the  cutter.  That  these 
impacts  were  not  greater  speaks  volumes  about  the  dedication  of  the  shipbuilding 
industry and its employees along the Gulf Coast. 

Of  course,  we  must  remain  vigilant  regarding  cost  growth.  However,  I  am  com-
mitted  to  working  with  industry  to  develop  and  promote  cost  reduction  measures

and  am  personally  engaged  with  the  CEO’s  of  Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop 
Grumman regarding my concerns. 

I’ve  also  read  that  the  Coast  Guard  is  not  in  control  of  the  Deepwater  Program; 
that  we’ve  somehow  abrogated  our  oversight  responsibilities  and  handed  industry 
the  ‘‘keys  to  the  vault.’’  That  is  not  true.  The  Coast  Guard  has  been  and  remains 
fully  involved  in  the  management  of  this  program  and  has  made  all  final  and  crit-
ical  decisions.  When  appropriate,  the  issues  are  briefed  all  the  way  up  the  chain  of 
command  to  me,  and  I  make  the  decision  myself.  And  following  recommendations 
from  DHS  auditors,  we  have  taken  steps  to  ensure  that  we  accurately  and  thor-
oughly document such decisions for future reference. 

We’ve redefined our award term and award fee criteria, making them more objec-
tive  in  order  to  improve  contractor  performance.  As  resources  allow,  the  Coast 
Guard  will  assume  greater  responsibility  as  the  system  integrator,  a  role  we  now 
feel better positioned to take on. 

It is critical that the senior leadership in each of our organizations meet regularly 
to  be  informed  of  the  progress  of  this  program  so  we  can  provide  executive  level 
oversight at all times, and specific direction when warranted. As a result, I am per-
sonally  committed  to  doing  all  that  I  can  to  make  this  a  successful  starting  point 
for further improvement in both the performance and relationships that exist within 
the Deepwater program, which is so vital to Coast Guard readiness. 
We’re on the Path to Change 

In  conclusion,  we  have  learned  some  hard  lessons  and  are  implementing  rec-
ommendations  from  the  GAO  and  OIG  to  keep  Deepwater  moving  forward.  We  are 
making significant progress and outfitting our fleet to meet 21st century threats and 
requirements. 

I  am  confident  the  NSC  is  on  the  correct  course,  I’m  convinced  our  FRC  ‘‘dual 
path’’  approach  is  the  best  and  fastest  way  to  address  the  patrol  boat  gap,  and  I’m 
pleased  that  our  Deepwater  aviation  assets  are  already  making  real  contributions 
within  the  fleet.  I  look  forward  to  the  delivery  of  additional  assets  and  the  oper-
ational capacity they will bring. They will close the existing aircraft and patrol boat 
gaps so that we can best protect our maritime borders and tend to the Nation’s busi-
ness at sea. 

I know you’re anxious for results; I am too, and I assure you nobody is as anxious 
as  the  men  and  women  of  the  Coast  Guard.  We  are  on  the  path  to  change,  and  we 
will not stop until Coast Guard has the tools it needs to protect America. 

I am the Commandant of the Coast Guard, I am responsible, I will do this right. 
Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you  today  and  for  all  you  do  for 
Coast  Guard  men  and  women.  I’m  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you  may  have. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Admiral Allen. 
Mr. Skinner? 

STATEMENT OF RICHARD L. SKINNER, INSPECTOR GENERAL, 

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

Mr.  SKINNER.  Good  afternoon,  Madam  Chair,  members  of  the 
Committee. I’m pleased to be here today. I am particularly pleased 
to  be  able  to  testify  side-by-side  with  Admiral  Allen,  the  Com-
mandant  of  the  Coast  Guard.  Together,  I’m  confident  that  we  can 
paint a clearer picture of the challenges facing the Deepwater Pro-
gram,  and  the  efforts  underway  to  improve  the  management  and 
oversight of this very important and complex acquisition initiative. 
Over the past two and a half years, my office has completed four 
audits  involving  the  Deepwater  Program.  They  involved  the  123- 
foot cutter, the National Security Cutter, the command and control 
information technology systems, and the re-engineering of the HH– 
65 helicopters. 

Four common themes and risks have emerged from each of these 
audits. First, the dominant influence of expediency. That is, sched-
ule  concerns  trump  performance  concerns.  This  is  best  illustrated 
by  the  National  Security  Cutter  procurement.  The  Coast  Guard 
proceeded  with  the  construction  of  the  NSC,  knowing  well  in  ad-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

26 

vance that its technical experts had engineering design, and future 
performance  concerns.  The  Coast  Guard  repeatedly  told  us  the  de-
cisions  regarding  the  NSC  reflected  more  than  simply  the  Naval 
engineering  perspective.  Rather,  they  also  encompassed  consider-
ations  of  cost,  schedule  and  performance.  However,  the  Coast 
Guard  was  unable  to  provide  any  documentation  to  support  this. 
The  design  and  performance  concerns  still  remain  outstanding 
today. And the cost to mitigate those concerns has yet to be deter-
mined.  Without  authoritative  documentation  to  support  the  Coast 
Guard’s  decision,  it  appears  the  NSC’s  construction  schedule 
trumped its performance capabilities. 

Second,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  contracts  are,  in  our 
opinion,  flawed.  Under  the  Deepwater  Program,  the  Coast  Guard 
essentially  agreed  to  ride  shotgun,  turning  the  reins  over  to  the 
systems  integrator.  Consequently,  the  Coast  Guard  was  reluctant 
to  exercise  its  authority  to  influence  the  design  and  production  of 
its  own  assets.  This  was  demonstrated  in  all  four  of  our  audit  re-
ports that we issued over the past two and a half years. 

Third,  our  reviews  have  raised  concerns  with  the  definition  and 
clarity of operational and performance requirements. This has com-
promised  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  hold  the  contractor  account-
able  for  its  performance.  For  example,  performance  specifications 
associated  with  upgrading  the  information  systems  on  the  Coast 
Guard 123-foot cutter, did not have a clearly defined expected level 
of  performance,  causing  the  Coast  Guard  to  accept  delivery  of  as-
sets that did not meet its anticipated requirements. 

Also,  in  our  review  of  the  HITRON  lease,  we  determined  that  a 
similar  lack  of  clarity  in  the  assets  contractual  performance  re-
quirements  challenged  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  effectively  as-
sess  contractor  performance.  In  the  NSC  acquisition,  the  cutter’s 
performance  specifications  were  so  poorly  worded,  that  there  were 
major  differences  within  the  Coast  Guard  itself  for  more  than  3 
years,  as  to  what  the  NSC’s  performance  capabilities  should  actu-
ally be. 

And  finally,  and  simply  put,  the  Coast  Guard  does  not  have  a 
sufficient  number  of  staff,  and  the  mix  of  expertise,  to  manage  an 
acquisition  as  large  and  complex  as  the  Deepwater  Program.  This 
is  most  evident  in  the  areas  of  program  management,  acquisition 
management,  and  financial  management.  Also,  many  of  the  staff 
who  have  been  assigned  to  the  Deepwater  Program  have  little  ex-
perience  or  training  in  such  a  large,  complex,  performance-based 
contract. 

These issues are not new to the Deepwater Program. As early as 
February  2003,  only  8  months  after  the  award  of  the  Deepwater 
contract  to  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems,  the  U.S.  Department 
of  Transportation  Office  of  Inspector  General  reported  that;  one, 
the  Coast  Guard  lacked  sufficient  management  controls  and  capa-
bility and capacity to oversee the Program. The Program was initi-
ated without the people needed to manage the effort, even with the 
out-sourcing of program management to a systems integrator; and, 
two, it did not have the business processes in place to project com-
plete,  current,  and  authoritative  life-cycle  costs.  Consequently,  the 
Coast Guard is unable to assert, with any degree of certainty, what 
the true ownership costs of the Deepwater program will be. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

27 

This  lack  of  proper  foundation  for  the  Deepwater  program  re-
mains  a  challenge  to  this  day.  And,  as  a  result,  the  Coast  Guard 
has encountered a number of implementation problems which have 
resulted in cost increases, schedule delays, and reduced operational 
performance. 

As  you  heard  today  from  Admiral  Allen,  the  Coast  Guard  recog-
nizes these challenges, and has taken corrective action to strength-
en  program  management  and  oversight,  such  as  granting  its  Chief 
Engineer with technical authority, thereby taking back the reins of 
the management of the contract; using independent third-party as-
sessments of performance; consolidating acquisition activities under 
one  Directorate;  and  redefining  the  contract  terms  and  conditions, 
including  the  award  fee  criteria  and  provisions  to  ensure  govern-
ment involvement in subcontract management in make-or-buy deci-
sions.  The  systems  integrator  need  not,  necessarily,  be  the  source 
of  supply.  Furthermore,  and  most  importantly,  as  Admiral  Allen 
has  pointed  out,  the  Coast  Guard  is  increasing  its  staffing  for  the 
Deepwater Program, and reinvigorating its acquisition training and 
certification  processes  to  ensure  that  staff  has  the  requisite  skills 
and education needed to manage the program. 

The  Coast  Guard  also  advised  that  it  is  taking  steps  to  improve 
documentation  of  key  Deepwater-related  decisions.  This  is  particu-
larly  important  to  ensure  transparency  and  accountability  as  the 
program moves forward. 

These  steps  should  significantly  increase  the  level  of  manage-
ment  and  oversight  exercised  over  the  assets  that  are  acquired  or 
modernized  under  the  Deepwater  Program.  However,  many  of 
these  corrective  measures  will  take  time,  such  as  building  a  pro-
curement  workforce  to  manage  the  broad  scope  and  complexity  of 
the program. Until this is accomplished, the Coast Guard needs to 
proceed with caution, taking advantage of all of the tools at its dis-
posal to mitigate risk and avoid future problems. 

Madam Chair, that concludes my statement, I’d be pleased to an-

swer any questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Skinner follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD L. SKINNER, INSPECTOR GENERAL, 

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Cantwell  and  members  of  the  Subcommittee.  I  am 
Richard  L.  Skinner,  Inspector  General  for  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security 
(DHS).  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  status  of  the  U.S.  Coast 
Guard’s Deepwater Program. 

My  testimony  today  will  address  the  broader  contract  and  program  management 
challenges associated with the Deepwater Program. We will also address how these 
challenges have impacted specific Deepwater assets, including the modernization of 
the 110/123-foot Island Class cutters; the National Security Cutter, the upgrades to 
the  Coast  Guard’s  Command,  Control,  Communication,  Computers,  Intelligence, 
Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  system;  the  re-engining  of  the  HH–65  helicopter; 
and the acquisition of the Fast Response Cutter. 
Deepwater Program 

The  Integrated  Deepwater  System  Program  (Deepwater)  is  a  $24  billion,  25-year 
acquisition  program  designed  to  replace,  modernize,  and  sustain  the  Coast  Guard’s 
aging  and  deteriorating  fleet  of  ships  and  aircraft,  providing  a  deepwater-capable 
fleet for 40 years. The Deepwater acquisition strategy is a non-traditional approach 
by  which  private  industry  was  asked  to  not  only  develop  and  propose  an  optimal 
system-of-systems mix of assets, infrastructure, information systems, and people so-
lution designed to accomplish all of the Coast Guard’s Deepwater missions, but also 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

28 

to  provide  the  assets,  the  systems  integration,  integrated  logistics  support,  and  the 
program  management.  Under  a  more  traditional  acquisition  strategy,  the  govern-
ment  would  have  separately  contracted  for  each  major  activity  or  asset  involved, 
such as cutters, aircraft, their logistics support, communications equipment, systems 
integration, and program management support. 

In June 2002, the Coast Guard awarded Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS) 
with  a  5-year  contract  to  serve  as  the  Deepwater  systems  integrator.  The  current 
base  contract  expires  in  June  2007  and  the  Coast  Guard  may  authorize  up  to  five 
additional  5-year  award  terms.  In  May  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  announced  its  deci-
sion to award ICGS an extension of the Deepwater contract for 43 out of a possible 
60 months for the next award term beginning in June 2007. ICGS is a joint venture 
of  Northrop  Grumman  and  Lockheed  Martin.  The  2002  award  decision  followed  a 
multiyear competitive phase where two other industry teams vied with ICGS. 
Deepwater Program Management and Oversight 

We have completed audits of the 110-foot/123-foot Modernization Project; the Na-
tional  Security  Cutter,  the  information  technology  systems;  and  the  re-engining  of 
the  HH–65  helicopters.  Common  themes  and  risks  emerged  from  these  audits,  pri-
marily  the  dominant  influence  of  expediency,  flawed  contract  terms  and  conditions, 
poorly  defined  performance  requirements,  and  inadequate  management  and  tech-
nical oversight. These deficiencies contributed to schedule delays, cost increases, and 
asset  designs  that  failed  to  meet  minimum  Deepwater  performance  requirements. 
Lead Systems Integrator Approach 

The route the Coast Guard took to outsource program management to the systems 
integrator  has  presented  challenges  in  implementation.  The  Deepwater  contract  es-
sentially  empowered  the  contractor  with  authority  for  decision-making.  Therefore, 
the  Coast  Guard  was  reluctant  to  exercise  a  sufficient  degree  of  authority  to  influ-
ence  the  design  and  production  of  its  own  assets.  Specifically,  under  the  contract 
ICGS  was  the  Systems  Integrator  and  assigned  full  technical  authority  over  all 
asset design and configuration decisions; while the Coast Guard’s technical role was 
limited to that of an expert ‘‘advisor.’’ However, there is no contractual requirement 
that  the  Systems  Integrator  accept  or  act  upon  the  Coast  Guard’s  technical  advice, 
regardless  of  its  proven  validity.  Furthermore,  there  are  no  contract  provisions  en-
suring  government  involvement  into  subcontract  management  and  ‘‘make-or-buy’’ 
decisions.  The  systems  integrator  decides  who  is  the  source  of  the  supply.  Also,  as 
the primary management tool for the Coast Guard to contribute its input on the de-
velopment  of  Deepwater  assets,  the  effectiveness  of  the  contractor-led  Integrated 
Product  Teams  (IPTs)  in  resolving  the  Coast  Guard’s  technical  concerns  has  been 
called into question by both the GAO and my office. 
Contractor Accountability 

Our  reviews  have  raised  concerns  with  the  definition  and  clarity  of  operational 
requirements,  contract  requirements  and  performance  specifications,  and  contrac-
tual  obligations.  For  example,  in  our  report  of  the  NSC,  we  reported  the  Coast 
Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) jointly developed standards that 
would govern the design, construction, and certification of all cutters acquired under 
the  Deepwater  Program.  These  standards  were  intended  to  ensure  that  competing 
industry teams developed proposals that met the Coast Guard’s unique performance 
requirements. Prior to the Phase 2 contract award, the Coast Guard provided these 
design  standards  to  the  competing  industry  teams.  Based  on  their  feedback,  the 
Coast Guard converted the majority of the standards (85 percent of the 1,175 stand-
ards)  to  guidance  and  permitted  the  industry  teams  to  select  their  own  alternative 
standards.  Without  a  contractual  mechanism  in  place  to  ensure  that  those  alter-
native  standards  met  or  exceeded  the  original  guidance  standards,  the  competing 
teams were allowed to select cutter design criteria. 

Additionally,  the  Deepwater  contract  gives  the  Systems  Integrator  the  authority 
to  make  all  asset  design  and  configuration  decisions  necessary  to  meet  system  per-
formance  requirements.  This  condition  allowed  ICGS  to  deviate  significantly  from 
a  set  of  cutter  design  standards  originally  developed  to  support  the  Coast  Guard’s 
unique mission requirements, and ICGS was further permitted to self-certify compli-
ance  with  those  design  standards.  As  a  result,  the  Coast  Guard  gave  ICGS  wide 
latitude  to  develop  and  validate  the  design  of  its  Deepwater  cutters,  including  the 
NSC. 
Deepwater Performance Requirements Are Ill-Defined 

A lack of clarity in the Deepwater contract’s terms and conditions have also com-
promised  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  hold  the  contractor  accountable  by  creating 
situations where competing interpretations of key provisions exist. For example, the

performance  specifications  associated  with  upgrading  the  information  systems  on 
the Coast Guard’s 123′ Island Class Patrol Boats did not have a clearly defined ex-
pected  level  of  performance.  Also,  in  our  review  of  the  HITRON  lease,  we  deter-
mined  that  a  similar  lack  of  clarity  in  the  asset’s  contractual  performance  require-
ments challenged the Coast Guard’s ability to effectively assess contractor perform-
ance. On the NSC acquisition, the cutter’s performance specifications were so poorly 
worded that there were major disagreements within the Coast Guard as to what the 
NSC’s performance capabilities should actually be. 
Deepwater Cost Increases 

The  cost  of  NSCs  1  and  2  is  expected  to  increase  well  beyond  the  current  $775 
million  estimate,  as  this  figure  does  not  include  a  $302  million  Request  for  Equi-
table  Adjustment  (REA)  submitted  to  the  Coast  Guard  by  ICGS  on  November  21, 
2005. The REA represents ICGS’s re-pricing of all work associated with the produc-
tion and deployment of NSCs 1 and 2 caused by adjustments to the cutters’ respec-
tive  implementation  schedules  as  of  January  31,  2005.  The  Coast  Guard  and  ICGS 
are  currently  engaged  in  negotiations  over  the  final  cost  of  the  current  REA,  al-
though ICGS has also indicated its intention to submit additional REAs for adjusted 
work  schedules  impacting  future  NSCs,  including  the  additional  cost  of  delays 
caused by Hurricane Katrina. 

The  current  $775  million  estimate  also  does  not  include  the  cost  of  structural 
modifications  to  be  made  to  the  NSC  as  a  result  of  its  known  design  deficiencies. 
In addition, future REAs and the cost of modifications to correct or mitigate the cut-
ter’s  existing  design  deficiencies  could  add  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  to  the 
total NSC acquisition cost. We remain concerned that these and other cost increases 
could  result  in  the  Coast  Guard  acquiring  fewer  NSCs  or  other  air  and  surface  as-
sets under the Deepwater contract. 
Impact on Coast Guard Operational Capabilities—Short- and Long-Term 

The  Deepwater  record  of  accomplishment  has  been  disappointing  to  date.  For  ex-
ample, while the re-engining of the HH–65 Bravo helicopters has resulted in an air-
craft with significantly improved capabilities, the program has experienced schedule 
delays  and  cost  increases.  For  example,  the  delivery  schedule  calls  for  the  HH–65 
re-engining  project  to  be  completed  by  November  2007  or  16  months  beyond  the 
Commandant’s original July 2006 deadline. Extending the delivery schedule has ex-
posed HH–65B aircrews to additional risk due to the tendency of the aircraft to ex-
perience loss of power mishaps. It also delays the replacement of the eight Airborne 
Use of Force-equipped MH–68 helicopters that are being leased to perform the Heli-
copter  Interdiction  (HITRON)  mission  at  a  cost  in  excess  of  $20  million  per  year. 
There  are  also  problems  with  Coast  Guard’s  acquisition  of  the  Vertical  take-off 
and landing unmanned aerial vehicle (VUAV). VUAVs have the potential to provide 
the Coast Guard flight-deck-equipped cutters with air surveillance, detection, classi-
fication,  and  identification  capabilities.  Currently,  the  VUAV  acquisition  is  over 
budget  and  more  than  10  months  behind  schedule.  The  Commandant  of  the  Coast 
Guard  recently  testified  that  the  VUAV  acquisition  was  under  review.  The  Com-
mandant indicated that the Coast Guard Research and Development Center is con-
ducting  a  study  and  will  provide  recommendations  for  the  way  ahead  with  the 
VUAV. A decision by the Coast Guard to stop work on the VUAV project would sig-
nificantly  impact  the  operational  capability  of  the  NSC  and  OPC  by  limiting  their 
ability  to  provide  long-range  surveillance  away  from  the  parent  cutter.  The  Coast 
Guard’s  Revised  Deepwater  Implementation  Plan,  2005  calls  for  the  acquisition  of 
45 VUAVs at a total cost of approximately $503.3 million. As of December 31, 2006, 
Coast Guard had obligated $108.4 million (73 percent) of the $147.7 million funded 
for the project. 

The  increased  cost,  schedule  delays,  and  structural  design  problems  associated 
with  the  123-foot  patrol  boat  and  the  FRC  have  further  exacerbated  the  Coast 
Guard’s  patrol  boat  operational  hour  and  capability  gap.  The  Coast  Guard  is  at-
tempting  to  mitigate  the  problem  by  re-negotiating  an  agreement  with  the  U.S. 
Navy  to  continue  the  operation  of  the  179-foot  ‘‘Cyclone’’  class  patrol  boats,  and  to 
extend  the  operational  capability  of  the  110-foot  Island  Class  fleet  through  the  use 
of multiple crews. While the increased operations tempo this will help in the short- 
term, it will also increase the wear and tear on these aging patrol boats in the long- 
term. 

The structural design issues associated with the NSC could have the greatest im-
pact  on  Coast  Guard  operational  capabilities  in  both  the  near-  and  long-term.  This 
is  due  to  cost  increases  that  far  exceed  the  cost  of  inflation  even  when  the  post-9/ 
11  engineering  change  proposals  and  the  costs  increases  associated  with  Hurricane 
Katrina are left out of the equation. These cost increases are largely due to: (1) ex-

isting  and  future  Requests  for  Equitable  Adjustment  that  the  Coast  Guard  expects 
to  receive  from  ICGS;  (2)  the  cost  of  NSC  ‘‘structural  enhancements,’’  the  number, 
type, scope, and cost of which have yet to be determined; and (3) the schedule delays 
and  lost  operational  capability,  that  are  expected  during  the  modification  to  NSCs 
1–8. 
Summary of Concerns Raised in Recent OIG Reports 
110/123′ Maritime Patrol Boat Modernization Project 

We recently completed an inquiry into allegations of a Hotline Complaint alleging 
that  the  Coast  Guard’s  123-foot  Island  Class  Patrol  Boats  (123′  cutter)  and  short- 
range prosecutor (prosecutor) contained safety and security vulnerabilities. The 123′ 
cutter  is  a  modification  of  the  110′  Island  Class  patrol  boat  and  was  phased  into 
service as part of the Deepwater project. The original Deepwater plan projected the 
conversion  of  forty-nine  110′  patrol  boats  into  123′  patrol  boats  as  a  bridging  strat-
egy  to  meet  patrol  boat  needs  until  the  new  Fast  Response  Cutter  was  introduced. 
The prosecutor is a 24′ 6″ small boat that can be deployed from the National Secu-
rity  Cutter,  Fast  Response  Cutter,  and  Offshore  Patrol  Cutter.  The  revised  Deep-
water  Implementation  Plan  calls  for  the  acquisition  of  91  prosecutors.  The  com-
plaint  said  that  these  vulnerabilities  were  the  result  of  the  contractor’s  failure  to 
comply  with  Command,  Control,  Communications,  Computer,  Intelligence,  Surveil-
lance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) design requirements as defined in the Deepwater 
contract. Specifically, the complainant alleged that: 

• The safety of the 123′ cutter’s crew was compromised by the contractor’s failure 

to utilize low smoke cabling; 

• The contractor knowingly installed aboard the 123′ cutter and prosecutor exter-
nal  C4ISR  equipment  that  did  not  meet  specific  environmental  requirements 
outlined in the Deepwater contract; 

• The cable installed during the upgrade to the cutter’s C4ISR system represented 

a security vulnerability; and, 

• The  video  surveillance  system  installed  aboard  the  123′  cutter  does  not  meet 

the cutter’s physical security requirements. 

Aspects of the C4ISR equipment installed aboard the 123′ cutters do not meet the 
design  standards  set  forth  in  the  Deepwater  contract.  Specifically,  two  of  the  four 
areas of concern identified by the complainant were substantiated and are the result 
of  the  contractor  not  complying  with  the  design  standards  identified  in  the  Deep-
water contract. For example, the contractor did not install low smoke cabling aboard 
the  123′  cutter,  despite  a  Deepwater  contract  requirement  that  stated,  ‘‘all  ship-
board cable added as a result of the modification to the vessel shall be low smoke.’’ 
The intent of this requirement was to eliminate the polyvinyl chloride jacket encas-
ing  the  cables,  which  for  years  produced  toxic  fumes  and  dense  smoke  during  ship-
board  fire.  Additionally,  the  contractor  installed  C4ISR  topside  equipment  aboard 
both the 123′ cutters and prosecutors, which either did not comply or was not tested 
to  ensure  compliance  with  specific  environmental  performance  requirements  out-
lined in the Deepwater contract. 

The  remaining  two  areas  of  concern  identified  by  the  complainant  were  in  tech-
nical  compliance  with  the  Deepwater  contract  and  deemed  acceptable  by  the  Coast 
Guard. Specifically, while the type of cabling installed during the C4ISR system up-
grade  to  the  123′  cutter  was  not  high-grade  braided  cable;  the  type  of  cable  used 
met  the  Coast  Guard’s  minimum-security  standards  as  required  by  the  Deepwater 
contract. Concerning the installation of the video surveillance system, while the sys-
tem did not provide 360 degrees of coverage, it met minimum contract requirements. 
Our  review  raises  many  concerns  about  Coast  Guard’s  program  and  technical 
oversight  of  the  Deepwater  contractor  responsible  for  the  110′/123′  Modernization 
Project.  For  example,  the  contractor  purchased  and  installed  hundreds  of  non  low 
smoke  cables  prior  to  Coast  Guard’s  approval  of  the  Request  for  Deviation.  We  are 
concerned  that  Coast  Guard  accepted  delivery  and  operated  four  123′  cutters  with-
out knowing the extent of the hazards associated with the use of the non low smoke 
cabling. The contractor also purchased and installed hundreds of C4ISR topside com-
ponents  aboard  the  123′  cutter  and  prosecutor  knowing  that  they  either  did  not 
meet  contract  performance  requirements  or  compliance  with  the  requirements  had 
not been verified. Had Coast Guard reviewed the contractor’s self-certification docu-
mentation, it would have determined that the contractor had not complied with the 
stated  weather  environment  standard.  For  these  reasons,  we  are  concerned  that 
similar  performance  issues  could  impact  the  operational  effectiveness  of  C4ISR  sys-
tem upgrades recently installed aboard its legacy fleet of cutters.

We  recommended  that  the  Coast  Guard  investigate  and  address  the  low  smoke 
cabling and environmental issues associated with the equipment installation identi-
fied  in  the  hotline  complaint  and  take  steps  to  prevent  similar  technical  oversight 
issues from affecting the remaining air, surface, and C4ISR assets to be modernized, 
upgraded, or acquired through the Deepwater Program. The Coast Guard concurred 
with  the  principle  findings  of  our  report  and  its  recommendations  and  said  it  is  in 
the process of implementing corrective measures. 
For reasons unrelated to the issues identified during our inquiry, operations of the 
123′ cutter fleet have been suspended. On November 30, 2006, the Coast Guard an-
nounced  that  it  was  suspending  operations  of  all  eight  123′  cutters  due  to  the  con-
tinuing  deformation  of  the  hulls  that  in  some  instances  resulted  in  hull  breaches. 
These  problems  had  previously  resulted  in  the  implementation  of  operating  restric-
tions  that  severely  undermined  the  mission  effectiveness  of  123′  cutter  fleet.  How-
ever,  these  operating  restrictions  did  not  resolve  the  hull  deformation  problem  but 
rather  mitigated  their  impact  on  crew  safety.  Consequently,  the  Coast  Guard  had 
to  consider  whether  to  implement  additional  operational  restrictions  in  order  to 
meet minimum crew safety requirements or to suspend 123′ cutter operations until 
a solution to these problems could be identified and implemented. The Coast Guard 
determined  that  additional  operating  limitations  would  have  further  undermined 
the  operational  effectiveness  of  the  123′  cutter.  For  these  reasons,  123′  cutter  fleet 
was  withdrawn  from  service.  Although  the  cutter  operations  have  been  suspended, 
the Coast Guard has not yet determined the final disposition of the 123′ cutter fleet. 
National Security Cutter (NSC) 

We recently issued a report on the Coast Guard’s acquisition of the National Secu-
rity  Cutter  (NSC).  The  objective  of  our  audit  was  to  determine  the  extent  to  which 
the  NSC  will  meet  the  cost,  schedule,  and  performance  requirements  contained  in 
the Deepwater contract. 

The  NSC,  as  designed  and  constructed,  will  not  meet  performance  specifications 
described in the original Deepwater contract. Specifically, due to design deficiencies, 
the NSC’s structure provides insufficient fatigue strength to achieve a 30-year serv-
ice  life  under  Caribbean  (General  Atlantic)  and  Gulf  of  Alaska  (North  Pacific)  sea 
conditions.  To  mitigate  the  effects  of  these  deficiencies,  the  Coast  Guard  intends  to 
modify  the  NSC’s  design  to  ensure  that  the  cutters  will  meet  the  service  and  fa-
tigue-life  requirements  specified  in  its  contract  with  the  systems  integrator.  How-
ever,  this  decision  was  made  after  the  Coast  Guard  authorized  production  of  2  of 
the 8 cutters being procured. 

The  Coast  Guard’s  technical  experts  first  identified  and  presented  their  concerns 
about the NSC’s structural design to senior Deepwater Program management in De-
cember 2002, but this did not dissuade the Coast Guard from authorizing production 
of  the  NSC  in  June  2004  or  from  its  May  2006  decision  to  award  the  systems  inte-
grator  a  contract  extension.  Due  to  a  lack  of  adequate  documentation,  we  were  un-
able to ascertain the basis for the decision to proceed with the production of the first 
two cutters, knowing that there were design flaws. 

Since the Deepwater contract was signed in June 2002, the combined cost of NSCs 
1 and 2 have increased from $517 million to approximately $775 million. These cost 
increases are largely due to design changes necessary to meet post-9/11 mission re-
quirements  and  other  government  costs  not  included  in  the  original  contract  price. 
The  $775  million  estimate  does  not  include  costs  to  correct  or  mitigate  the  NSC’s 
structural design deficiencies, additional labor and material costs resulting from the 
effects of Hurricane Katrina, and the final cost of the $302 million Request for Equi-
table Adjustment (REA) that the Coast Guard is currently negotiating with the sys-
tems integrator (ICGS). 

NSC  1  was  christened  on  November  11,  2006,  and  final  delivery  to  the  Coast 
guard  is  scheduled  for  August  2007.  NSC  2  is  currently  under  construction  and  is 
scheduled for delivery during the Summer of 2008. As of December 31, 2006, Coast 
Guard had obligated $751.6 million (49 percent) of the $1,518 million funded for the 
project. 

We made five recommendations to the Coast Guard. Our recommendations are in-
tended to ensure the NSC is capable of fulfilling all performance requirements out-
lined  in  the  Deepwater  contract:  and  to  improve  the  level  of  Coast  Guard  technical 
oversight and accountability. 
Information Technology Systems 

We also audited the Coast Guard’s efforts to design and implement command, con-
trol,  communications,  computers,  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance 
(C4ISR) systems to support the Deepwater Program. We determined that the Coast 
Guard’s efforts to develop its Deepwater C4ISR system could be improved. Although

Coast  Guard  officials  are  involved  in  high-level  Deepwater  information  technology 
requirements definition process, they had limited influence over contractor decisions 
toward  meeting  these  requirements.  A  lack  of  discipline  in  requirements  change 
management  processes  provided  little  assurance  that  the  requirements  remain  up- 
to-date  or  effective  in  meeting  program  goals.  Certification  and  accreditation  of 
Deepwater  C4ISR  equipment  was  difficult  to  achieve,  placing  systems  security  and 
operations at risk. Further, although the Deepwater program had established infor-
mation  technology  testing  procedures,  the  contractor  did  not  follow  them  consist-
ently  to  ensure  the  C4ISR  systems  and  the  assets  on  which  they  are  installed  per-
formed effectively. 

Additionally, the Coast Guard faced several challenges to implementing effectively 
its  Deepwater  C4ISR  systems.  Due  to  limited  oversight  as  well  as  unclear  contract 
requirements,  the  agency  did  not  ensure  that  the  contractor  was  making  the  best 
decisions  toward  accomplishing  Deepwater  IT  goals.  Insufficient  C4ISR  funding  re-
stricted accomplishing the ‘‘system-of-systems’’ objectives that are considered funda-
mental  to  Deepwater  asset  interoperability.  Inadequate  training  and  guidance  also 
hindered  users  from  realizing  the  full  potential  of  the  C4ISR  upgrades.  Instituting 
effective  mechanisms  for  maintaining  C4ISR  equipment  have  been  equally  chal-
lenging. 

We  made  9  recommendations  to  the  Coast  Guard.  Our  recommendations  are  in-
tended  to  increase  agency  input  and  oversight  into  the  requirements  definition  and 
to  clearly  define  the  management  processes  used  to  evaluate  and  apply  changes  to 
the Deepwater C4ISR requirements. We also recommended that the Coast Guard in-
crease  staffing  levels  and  evaluate  its  C4ISR  spending  priorities  to  improve  tech-
nical  and  financial  oversight  over  the  C4ISR  acquisition.  Finally,  we  recommended 
that the Coast Guard takes steps to improve the training and technical support pro-
vided to C4ISR system users. Coast Guard concurred with all nine recommendations 
contained in our audit report and is in the process of implementing corrective meas-
ures. 

Recently, the Coast Guard provided an update regarding the progress being made 
to  implement  the  recommendations  contained  in  our  August  2006  report.  In  their 
response,  the  Coast  Guard  stated  that  the  language  contained  in  the  Deepwater 
contract, including the contract’s ‘‘award term’’ criteria, had been revised to further 
clarify contractor responsibilities for developing Deepwater C4ISR systems. 

However,  the  Coast  Guard  is  struggling  to  provide  the  funding  needed  to  accom-
plish  system  of  system  objectives  and  maintain  an  adequate  level  of  oversight  over 
the  Deepwater  contractor.  For  example,  during  FY  2005,  C4ISR  program  managers 
requested  28  additional  staff  positions  to  help  with  contractor  oversight.  However, 
only  5  positions  were  authorized  due  to  a  lack  of  funding.  As  a  result,  the  Coast 
Guard  has  had  to  divert  management’s  attention  from  systems  development  tasks 
to  the  re-planning  and  re-phasing  the  work  to  match  the  funding  constraints  and 
economize in carrying out its program oversight and support activities. 
HH–65 Helicopter 

We  also  reviewed  the  Coast  Guard’s  HH–65  Dolphin  helicopter  re-engining 
project.  The  review  was  initiated  in  response  to  concerns  that  the  re-engining  re-
quirements  specified  for  the  HH–65  helicopter  were  not  sufficient  for  the  needs  of 
the  Coast  Guard  over  the  Deepwater  project  time-frame.  Specifically,  the  HH–65 
was  experiencing  a  sharp  increase  in  the  number  in-flight  loss  of  power  mishaps 
that jeopardized the safety of HH–65 flight crews. Between October 1, 2003, and Au-
gust  31,  2004,  HH–65  aircrews  reported  150  in-flight  loss  of  power  mishaps.  This 
was  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  64  in-flight  loss  of  power  mishaps  that  were  reported 
between FY 2000 and FY 2003. Concerns were also raised about: (1) the capabilities 
of  the  Honeywell  LTS–101–850  engine;  (2)  the  potential  cost,  delivery,  and  oper-
ational risks associated with the Coast Guard’s decision to enter into a contract with 
Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  (ICGS)  to  re-engine  the  HH–65  fleet  with  Arriel 
2C2  engines;  and  (3)  the  ICGS  proposal  not  meeting  the  Coast  Guard’s  desire  to 
have  84  HH–65s  re-engined  within  a  24-month  period,  by  July  2006,  as  mandated 
by  the  Commandant.  In  our  view,  extending  the  delivery  dates  unnecessarily  ex-
posed HH–65 aircrews to additional risk due to the unprecedented rate in which in- 
flight loss of power mishaps were occurring. 

Our  review  of  the  HH–65  re-engining  project  determined  the  replacement  of  the 
Honeywell  LTS–101–750  engines  originally  installed  aboard  the  HH–65  helicopter 
with  the  Arriel  2C2  engine  would  resolve  the  safety  and  reliability  issues  that  had 
plagued  the  HH–65  fleet  for  much  of  the  past  decade.  Our  report  also  determined 
that  it  would  be  timelier  and  more  cost-effective  to  have  the  re-engining  performed 
at the Coast Guard Aircraft and Repair Supply Center (ARSC) than it would if the 
Coast  Guard  placed  the  responsibility  for  the  re-engining  under  the  auspices  of

ICGS. The Coast Guard’s Assistant Commandant for Operations made a similar rec-
ommendation in May 2004. 

ICGS’ cost proposal for re-engining the HH–65 fleet was $294 million, or $40 mil-
lion  more  than  the  Coast  Guard  estimated  for  re-engining  the  aircraft  in-house  at 
ARSC.  This  was  a  significant  cost  differential  given  ICGS’  intention  to  have  83  (87 
percent) of the 95 HH–65s re-engined at ARSC, the effect these additional expendi-
tures could have on the Coast Guard’s ability to sustain and upgrade its legacy avia-
tion  assets,  and  the  stated  inability  of  ICGS  to  re-engine  the  aircraft  within  the 
Commandant’s 24 month timeline. To date, 69 re-engined HH–65s have been deliv-
ered  to  the  Coast  Guard.  The  remaining  HH–65  helicopters  are  to  be  delivered  to 
the Coast Guard by the end of FY 2007. As of December 31, 2006, Coast Guard had 
obligated $307 million (89 percent) of the $343 million funded for the project. 

We made five recommendations to the Coast Guard. Specifically, we recommended 
the  Coast  Guard  implement  the  Assistant  Commandant  for  Operations  May  2004 
recommendation  that  the  HH–65  re-engining  project  be  taken  from  ICGS  and  per-
formed  as  a  government-performed  contract.  We  also  recommended  that  the  Coast 
Guard:  (1)  refurbish  additional  HH–65  helicopters;  (2)  expedite  the  replacement  of 
the  MH–68  helicopters  operated  by  it  Helicopter  Interdiction  squadron  in  Jackson-
ville; and (3) take the savings from the termination of the HITRON lease to mitigate 
the costs associated with the maintenance of its legacy aviation assets. 

The Coast Guard did not concur with any of the report’s recommendations. Their 
primary  rationale  being  that  ICGS  minimized  the  operational,  legal,  and  contract 
performance  risks  associated  with  the  re-engining.  The  Coast  Guard  also  stated  it 
believed that it received significant benefits from the current ICGS contract that far 
outweighed the costs of having the Coast Guard manage the project. We did not and 
do not believe these benefits have been demonstrated in this instance. 

The Coast Guard, however, did state in its response that it supported our conten-
tion  that  additional  refurbished  HH–65s  were  needed  and  that  the  MH–68  heli-
copters needed to be replaced with AUF-equipped HH–65s as soon as possible. How-
ever, in both instances, the Coast Guard cited a lack of funding as the primary rea-
son for not implementing these recommendations. 
Fast Response Cutter 

The  Fast  Response  Cutter  is  intended  to  be  the  Coast  Guard’s  maritime  security 
workhorse,  patrolling  in  both  coastal  and  high  seas  areas.  According  to  the  Coast 
Guard, the FRC can safely and effectively operate in higher sea conditions than its 
legacy  counterpart  and  can  remain  at  sea  for  up  to  7  days,  2  days  longer  than  the 
Coast  Guard’s  legacy  110-foot  cutter.  The  original  2002  Deepwater  implementation 
plan called for the Coast Guard to take delivery of the first FRCs in 2018. However, 
because of the suspension of the 123-foot conversion project and deterioration of the 
remaining 110-foot patrol boats, the FRC project was accelerated to achieve delivery 
of the first FRCs in 2007, more than 10 years ahead schedule. However, in February 
2006,  the  Coast  Guard  announced  that  it  was  suspending  design  work  on  the  FRC 
due to technical issues identified with the hull design. The Coast Guard is currently 
assessing the suitability of designs in operational service in order to procure a prov-
en  patrol  boat  as  an  interim  solution  to  address  its  urgent  operational  needs  until 
the technical issues associated with the current FRC design are alleviated. We have 
not  yet  evaluated  the  cost,  schedule,  and  performance  issues  associated  with  the 
FRC  acquisition.  We  do  know  that  as  of  December  31,  2006,  Coast  Guard  had  obli-
gated  $49.4  million  (24  percent)  of  the  $208  million  funded  for  the  project  to  date. 
Conclusion 

The  Coast  Guard  recognizes  these  challenges  and  is  taking  aggressive  action  to 
strengthen  program  management  and  oversight—such  as  technical  authority  des-
ignation;  use  of  independent,  third-party  assessments;  consolidation  of  acquisition 
activities  under  one  directorate;  and  redefinition  of  the  contract  terms  and  condi-
tions,  including  award  fee  criteria.  Furthermore,  and  most  importantly,  the  Coast 
Guard  is  increasing  its  staffing  for  the  Deepwater  program,  and  reinvigorating  its 
acquisition  training  and  certification  processes  to  ensure  that  staff  have  the  req-
uisite skills and education needed to manage the program. The Coast Guard is also 
taking  steps  to  improve  the  documentation  of  key  Deepwater-related  decisions.  If 
fully-implemented,  these  steps  should  significantly  increase  the  level  of  manage-
ment  oversight  exercised  over  the  air,  surface,  and  C4ISR  assets  that  are  acquired 
or  modernized  under  the  Deepwater  Program.  We  look  forward  to  working  closely 
with  the  Coast  Guard  to  continue  the  improvement  of  the  efficiency,  effectiveness, 
and economy of the Deepwater Program. 

I  will  conclude  by  restating  that  we  continue  to  be  highly  committed  to  the  over-
sight  of  the  Deepwater  Program  and  other  major  acquisitions  within  the  Depart-

in  order  to  assess  the  most  appropriate  cycle  for  reporting  the  program’s  progress.

STATEMENT OF STEPHEN L. CALDWELL, ACTING DIRECTOR, 

HOMELAND SECURITY AND JUSTICE ISSUES, 
U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 

Mr.  CALDWELL.  Senator  Cantwell,  Senator  Snowe,  Senators 
Kerry, Lautenberg and Vitter, I’m very pleased to be here again be-
fore your Committee to talk about GAO’s Deepwater work. 

While  we’ve  been  providing  Congress  with  oversight  information 
on  Deepwater  since  1998,  I  think  we’re  at  a  transition  point  in 
terms of oversight, all of us collectively. To make an analogy—we’re 
shifting  from  looking  at  the  forest,  to  looking  at  the  trees.  And  in 
terms  of  what  that  means  for  Deepwater,  it’s  a  shift  from  looking 
at  the  overall  structure  and  management  of  the  contract,  which  is 
something  we  are  still  looking  at,  to  looking  at  some  of  these  indi-
vidual assets as they are designed or delivered. 

What we’re finding is, unfortunately while that shift in focus has 
occurred,  the  view  has  not  improved.  So,  while  there  are  some  as-
sets that have been successful, and Admiral Allen has talked about 
those, we’ve got some major problems with some of the vessels that 
have recently been delivered. 

As  mentioned  in  my  statement,  since  2001  we  have  identified 
risks  with  the  Coast  Guard’s  overall  approach  to  Deepwater,  in 
terms  of  relying  on  a  lead  integrator,  developing  a  system  of  sys-
tems,  and  using  a  performance-based  contract.  All  three  of  these 
aspects,  if  not  done  with  appropriate  oversight,  could  increase  the 
risk of the Coast Guard to be able to adequately manage an acqui-
sition of this scope and magnitude. 

My  statement  also  refers  to  our  2004  report,  where  we  made  11 
recommendations  to  the  Coast  Guard,  in  the  areas  of  program 
management, contractor accountability, and cost control. And more 
recently,  the  Coast  Guard  has  reported  to  Congress  on  the  status 
of those recommendations. 

When  I  last  testified  before  this  Committee  last  Spring,  we  had 
recently  issued  a  report,  which  noted  some  Coast  Guard  progress 
toward closing out those recommendations. And we are currently in 
the process of reviewing the Coast Guard’s continuing work to close 
those recommendations. This ongoing GAO review is being done for 
the Senate and House Appropriations Committees as part of a leg-
islative mandate. I assure you that we will provide this committee 
with  an  update,  as  soon  as  new  information  is  available  on  that. 
But  now,  moving  from  that  forest  to  the  trees,  I  think  some  of 
our more recent work, focusing on the individual assets, has identi-
fied  additional  problems.  Last  Spring,  our  report  on  the  Fast  Re-
sponse Cutter noted problems that ultimately led the Coast Guard 
to  stop  all  design  work  on  that  particular  vessel.  Similarly,  recent 
reports  as  just  noted  here,  by  the  Inspector  General,  have  noted 
the problems with the National Security Cutter, as well as the 123- 
foot patrol boat.

These asset-specific reports expand the focus of the problem from 
that  of  acquisition  management  to  operational  effectiveness  which, 
as  many  of  us  know,  is  considered  one  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  core 
competencies. So, this is where the rubber is supposed to meet the 
road, but it is not doing so. 

The suspension of the FRC design work, and most especially, the 
suspension  of  the  123-foot  patrol  boat  operations,  highlights  just 
how important acquisition management is. And it really shows the 
effect now on the Coast Guard’s key missions, such as maritime se-
curity, fisheries protection, search and rescue and even national de-
fense. 

Admiral  Allen,  as  well  as  Admiral  Blore,  in  their  testimony 
today—and  before  other  committees—clearly  have  made  it  a  pri-
ority  to  give  their  sailors  and  airmen  vessels  and  aircraft  as  soon 
as  possible.  Admiral  Allen  just  referred  to  that  as  the  promise  of 
Deepwater, and they’ve outlined several steps to improve the man-
agement of Deepwater toward that promise. 

Here  at  GAO,  we  stand  ready  to  assist  Congress,  working  again 
with  the  Coast  Guard,  toward  that  same  promise.  However,  as 
auditors,  we  must  observe  our  traditional  caution,  and  due  dili-
gence,  in  evaluating  whether  the  efforts  that  have  been  laid  out 
here, will actually achieve their desired outcomes. 

Thank you, and I’d be pleased to answer any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF STEPHEN L. CALDWELL, ACTING DIRECTOR, HOMELAND 

SECURITY AND JUSTICE ISSUES, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 

Madam Chair and members of the Subcommittee: 
Thank  you  for  inviting  me  here  today  to  discuss  our  reviews  of  the  U.S.  Coast 
Guard’s $24 billion Deepwater program. While there is widespread acknowledgment 
that  many  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  aging  assets  need  replacement  or  renovation,  con-
cerns also exist about the acquisition approach the Coast Guard adopted in launch-
ing the Deepwater program. From the outset, we have expressed concern about the 
risks  involved  with  the  Coast  Guard’s  acquisition  strategy. 1 The  subsequent 
changes  in  the  Deepwater  asset  mix  and  delivery  schedules  only  increased  these 
concerns. In 2004, we reported that well into the contract’s second year, key compo-
nents  needed  to  manage  the  program  and  oversee  the  system  integrator’s  perform-
ance had not been effectively implemented. 2 Accordingly, we made 11 recommenda-
tions  to  address  three  broad  areas  of  concern:  improving  program  management, 
strengthening contractor accountability, and promoting cost control through greater 
competition among potential subcontractors. 

My  statement  today  will  discuss  our  prior  work  on  the  Coast  Guard’s  Deepwater 

program. Specifically, I will discuss: 

• the Coast Guard’s acquisition approach for the Deepwater program; 
• previous GAO recommendations to the Coast Guard on Deepwater, highlighting 

the importance of Integrated Product Teams; and 

• operational  challenges  the  Coast  Guard  is  facing  because  of  performance  and 

design problems with Deepwater patrol boats. 

This testimony is based on our prior work on the Deepwater program. That work 
was  conducted  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  government  auditing  stand-
ards. We have ongoing work across all of the issues discussed in this statement.

Summary 

36 

In  2001,  we  described  the  Deepwater  program  as  ‘‘risky’’  due  to  the  unique,  un-
tried  acquisition  strategy  for  a  project  of  this  magnitude  within  the  Coast  Guard. 
The Coast Guard used a system-of-systems approach to replace deteriorating assets 
with a single, integrated package of aircraft, vessels, and unmanned aerial vehicles, 
to be linked through systems that provide command, control, communications, com-
puter,  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  (C4ISR),  and  supporting  logis-
tics.  In  a  system-of-systems,  the  delivery  of  Deepwater  assets  are  interdependent, 
thus  schedule  slippages  and  uncertainties  associated  with  potential  changes  in  the 
design  and  capabilities  of  any  one  asset  could  increase  the  overall  risks  that  the 
Coast  Guard  might  not  meet  its  expanded  homeland  security  performance  require-
ments  within  given  budget  parameters  and  milestone  dates.  The  Coast  Guard  also 
used  a  system  integrator—which  can  give  the  contractor  extensive  involvement  in 
requirements  development,  design,  and  source  selection  of  major  system  and  sub-
system subcontractors. The Deepwater program is also a performance-based acquisi-
tion,  meaning  that  it  is  structured  around  the  results  to  be  achieved  rather  than 
the  manner  in  which  the  work  is  performed.  If  performance-based  acquisitions  are 
not  appropriately  planned  and  structured,  there  is  an  increased  risk  that  the  gov-
ernment  may  receive  products  or  services  that  are  over  cost  estimates,  delivered 
late, and of unacceptable quality. 

Our  reported  concerns  and  related  recommendations  in  2004  and  in  subsequent 
assessments in 2005 and 2006 have centered on three main areas: program manage-
ment,  contractor  accountability,  and  cost  control  through  competition.  In  the  area 
of  program  management,  among  other  things,  our  prior  work  has  found  that  Inte-
grated Product Teams (IPTs)—the Coast Guard’s primary tool for managing the pro-
gram  and  overseeing  the  contractor—have  struggled  to  effectively  carry  out  their 
missions.  We  recommended  that,  among  other  things,  Coast  Guard  improve  the 
IPTs by initiating actions to establish timely charters and training. In terms of con-
tractor  accountability,  in  2004  we  found  that  the  Coast  Guard  had  not  developed 
quantifiable  metrics  to  hold  the  system  integrator  accountable  for  its  ongoing  per-
formance,  the  process  by  which  the  Coast  Guard  assessed  performance  after  the 
first year of the contract lacked rigor, and the Coast Guard had not begun to meas-
ure the system integrator’s performance on the three overarching goals of the Deep-
water  program—maximizing  operational  effectiveness,  minimizing  total  ownership 
costs, and satisfying the customer. Thus, one recommendation we made for improv-
ing  contractor  accountability  was  to  devise  a  timeframe  for  measuring  the  contrac-
tor’s  progress  toward  improving  operational  effectiveness.  We  also  reported  in  2004 
that,  although  competition  among  subcontractors  was  a  key  vehicle  for  controlling 
costs,  the  Coast  Guard  had  neither  measured  the  extent  of  competition  among  the 
suppliers of Deepwater assets nor held the system integrator accountable for taking 
steps  to  achieve  competition.  Consequently,  we  recommended  that  Coast  Guard  de-
velop  a  plan  to  hold  the  contractor  accountable  for  ensuring  adequate  competition 
among  suppliers.  While  we  recognize  that  the  Coast  Guard  has  taken  steps  to  ad-
dress our findings and recommendations, aspects of the Deepwater program will re-
quire continued attention. 

In  addition  to  the  Deepwater  program  management  issues  discussed  above,  the 
Coast  Guard  is  facing  operational  challenges  because  of  performance  and  design 
problems with Deepwater patrol boats. Specifically, the conversion of legacy 110-foot 
patrol  boats  to  upgraded  123-foot  patrol  boats  was  stopped  at  eight  hulls  (rather 
than the entire fleet of 49) due to deck cracking, hull buckling, and shaft alignment 
problems. These patrol boat conversion problems ultimately led the Coast Guard to 
suspend  all  normal  operations  of  the  eight  converted  123-foot  patrol  boats  on  No-
vember 30, 2006. The Coast Guard is now exploring options to address the resulting 
short-term  operational  gaps.  There  have  also  been  design  problems  with  the  new 
Fast  Response  Cutter  (FRC),  intended  to  replace  all  110-foot  and  123-foot  patrol 
boats.  In  February  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  suspended  design  work  on  the  FRC  due 
to  design  risks  such  as  excessive  weight  and  horsepower  requirements. 3 In  moving 
forward  with  the  FRC  acquisition  as  planned,  the  Coast  Guard  will  end  up  having 
to operate two classes of FRCs—which has resulted in a slippage of the anticipated 
FRC delivery date. One class will be based on an adapted design from a patrol boat 
already  on  the  market  and  another  class  that  would  be  redesigned  to  address  the 
problems  in  the  original  FRC  design  plans.  Thus,  the  Coast  Guard  is  also  facing 
longer-term operational gaps related to its patrol boats. As with the 123-foot patrol

boats, the Coast Guard is looking at options to address these long-term operational 
gaps. 
Background 

For  about  a  decade,  the  Coast  Guard  has  been  developing  an  Integrated  Deep-
water  System  (or  Deepwater)  acquisition  program,  a  long-term  plan  to  replace  or 
modernize its fleet of vessels and aircraft. Many of these legacy assets are at or ap-
proaching  the  end  of  their  estimated  service  lives.  Deepwater  is  the  largest  and 
most  complex  acquisition  project  in  the  Coast  Guard’s  history.  The  acquisition  is 
scheduled  to  include  the  modernization  and  replacement  of  an  aging  fleet  of  over 
90  cutters  and  200  aircraft  used  for  missions  that  generally  occur  beyond  50  miles 
from  the  shore.  As  originally  conceived,  Deepwater  was  designed  around  producing 
aircraft  and  vessels  that  would  function  in  the  Coast  Guard’s  traditional  at-sea 
roles, such as interdicting illicit drug shipments or rescuing mariners from difficulty 
at sea. 

After  the  terrorist  attacks  on  September  11,  2001,  however,  these  aircraft  and 
vessels  began  taking  on  additional  missions  related  to  protection  of  ports,  water-
ways, and coastal areas. As a result, the Coast Guard began revising the Deepwater 
implementation  plan  to  provide  replacement  assets  that  could  better  address  these 
added  responsibilities.  In  August  2005,  the  Coast  Guard  issued  the  revised  Deep-
water  implementation  plan  detailing  the  assets  it  planned  to  modify  or  acquire, 
along  with  the  proposed  costs  and  schedules  for  doing  so.  Then,  in  February  2006, 
the  Coast  Guard  again  updated  its  Deepwater  plan  to  align  with  its  Fiscal  Year 
2007 budget submissions. The revised plan increased overall program costs from the 
original  estimate  of  $17  billion  to  $24  billion.  Overall,  the  acquisition  schedule  was 
lengthened  by  5  years,  with  the  final  assets  now  scheduled  for  delivery  in  2027. 4 
Coast Guard’s Acquisition Approach to Deepwater Program 

In  2001,  we  described  the  Deepwater  program  as  ‘‘risky’’  due  to  the  unique,  un-
tried  acquisition  strategy  for  a  project  of  this  magnitude  within  the  Coast  Guard. 
The  approach  included  the  development  of  a  system-of-systems,  a  single  system  in-
tegrator, and a performance-based contract. 
System-of-Systems 

Rather than using the traditional approach of replacing classes of ships or aircraft 
through  a  series  of  individual  acquisitions,  the  Coast  Guard  chose  to  use  a  system- 
of-systems  acquisition  strategy  that  would  replace  its  deteriorating  assets  with  a 
single,  integrated  package  of  aircraft,  vessels,  and  unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  to  be 
linked through systems that provide C4ISR, 5 and supporting logistics. Through this 
approach,  the  Coast  Guard  hoped  to  avoid  ‘‘stovepiping’’  the  acquisition  of  vessels 
and aircraft, which might lead to a situation where they could not operate optimally 
together. 

Our past work on Deepwater noted that decisions on air assets were made by one 
subcontractor,  while  decisions  regarding  surface  assets  were  made  by  another  sub-
contractor.  This  approach  can  lessen  the  likelihood  that  a  system-of-systems  out-
come will be achieved if decisions affecting the entire program are made without the 
full consultation of all parties involved. Our more recent work on the Fast Response 
Cutter  (FRC)—which  is  discussed  in  more  detail  later—indicated  that  changes  in 
the  design  and  delivery  date  for  the  FRC  could  affect  the  operations  of  the  overall 
system-of-systems  approach.  Because  the  delivery  of  Deepwater  assets  are  inter-
dependent  within  the  system-of-systems  acquisition  approach,  schedule  slippages 
and  uncertainties  associated  with  potential  changes  in  the  design  and  capabilities 
of  the  new  assets  have  increased  the  risks  that  the  Coast  Guard  may  not  meet  its 
expanded homeland security performance requirements within given budget param-
eters and milestone dates. 
System Integrator 

In  June  2002,  the  Coast  Guard  awarded  the  Deepwater  contract  to  Integrated 
Coast  Guard  Systems  (ICGS).  ICGS—a  business  entity  jointly  owned  by  Northrop 
Grumman  and  Lockheed  Martin—is  a  system  integrator,  responsible  for  designing, 
constructing,  deploying,  supporting,  and  integrating  the  Deepwater  assets  to  meet 
Coast  Guard  requirements.  This  type  of  business  arrangement  can  give  the  con-
tractor  extensive  involvement  in  requirements  development,  design,  and  source  se-

lection  of  major  system  and  subsystem  subcontractors.  This  management  approach 
of  using  a  system  integrator  has  been  used  on  other  government  programs  that  re-
quire  system-of-systems  integration,  such  as  the  Army’s  Future  Combat  System,  a 
networked family of weapons and other systems. 

Government  agencies  have  turned  to  the  system  integrator  approach  when  they 
believe  they  do  not  have  the  in-house  capability  to  design,  develop,  and  manage 
complex acquisitions. Giving contractors more control and influence over the govern-
ment’s acquisitions in a system integrator role creates a potential risk that program 
decisions  and  products  could  be  influenced  by  the  financial  interest  of  the  con-
tractor—which  is  accountable  to  its  shareholders—which  may  not  match  the  pri-
mary  interest  of  the  government,  maximizing  its  return  on  taxpayer  dollars.  The 
system  integrator  arrangement  creates  an  inherent  risk,  as  the  contractor  is  given 
more  discretion  to  make  certain  program  decisions.  Along  with  this  greater  discre-
tion comes the need for more government oversight and an even greater need to de-
velop well-defined outcomes at the outset. 
Performance-Based Acquisition 

The Deepwater program has been designated as a performance-based acquisition. 
When  buying  services,  Federal  agencies  are  currently  required  to  employ—to  the 
maximum extent feasible—this concept, wherein acquisitions are structured around 
the results to be achieved as opposed to the manner in which the work is to be per-
formed. That is, the government specifies the outcome it requires while leaving the 
contractor to propose decisions about how it will achieve that outcome. Performance- 
based  contracts  for  services  are  required  to  include  a  performance  work  statement; 
measurable  performance  standards  (i.e.,  in  terms  of  quality,  timeliness,  quantity, 
etc.) as well as the method of assessing contractor performance against these stand-
ards;  and  performance  incentives,  where  appropriate.  If  performance-based  acquisi-
tions  are  not  appropriately  planned  and  structured,  there  is  an  increased  risk  that 
the government may receive products or services that are over cost estimates, deliv-
ered late, and of unacceptable quality. 
Deepwater Indicative of Broader, Systemic Acquisition Challenges 

Some  of  the  problems  the  Coast  Guard  is  experiencing  with  the  Deepwater  pro-
gram  (as  discussed  later  in  this  statement),  in  principle,  are  indicative  of  broader 
and  systemic  challenges  we  have  identified  for  complex,  developmental  systems. 
These challenges, based mostly on our reviews of Department of Defense programs, 
include: 

• Program  requirements  that  are  set  at  unrealistic  levels,  then  changed  fre-
quently  as  recognition  sets  in  that  they  cannot  be  achieved.  As  a  result,  too 
much time passes; threats may change; and/or members of the user and acquisi-
tion communities may simply change their minds. The resulting program insta-
bility causes cost escalation, schedule delays, fewer quantities, and reduced con-
tractor accountability. 

• Program  decisions  to  move  into  design  and  production  are  made  without  ade-

quate standards or knowledge. 

• Contracts,  especially  service  contracts,  often  do  not  have  measures  in  place  at 

the outset in order to control costs and facilitate accountability. 

• Contracts typically do not accurately reflect the complexity of projects or appro-

priately allocate risk between the contractors and the taxpayers. 

• The  acquisition  workforce  faces  serious  challenges  (e.g.,  size,  skills,  knowledge, 

and succession planning). 

• Incentive  and  award  fees  are  often  paid  based  on  contractor  attitudes  and  ef-

forts versus positive results, such as cost, quality, and schedule. 

• Inadequate government oversight results in little to no accountability for recur-

ring and systemic problems. 

Previous GAO Recommendations Have Focused on Three Areas 

Our  assessment  of  the  Deepwater  program  in  2004  found  that  the  Coast  Guard 
had  not  effectively  managed  the  program  or  overseen  the  system  integrator. 6 We 
specifically made 11 recommendations to the Coast Guard, which can found at Table 
1 on page 12. Our reported concerns in 2004 and in subsequent assessments in 2005 
and  2006  have  centered  on  three  main  areas:  program  management,  contractor  ac-

countability, and cost control through competition. Each of these three areas is dis-
cussed in more detail below. 

While we recognize that the Coast Guard has taken steps to address our findings 
and recommendations, aspects of the Deepwater program will require continued at-
tention.  A  project  of  this  magnitude  will  likely  continue  to  experience  other  prob-
lems  as  more  becomes  known.  We  have  ongoing  work  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the 
Coast Guard’s efforts. 
Program Management and the Importance of Integrated Product Teams 

Our previous work and recommendations were based on concerns about the Coast 
Guard’s  program  management.  For  example,  we  reported  in  2004  that  the  Coast 
Guard  had  not  adequately  communicated  to  its  operational  personnel  decisions  on 
how  new  and  old  assets  would  be  integrated  and  how  maintenance  responsibilities 
would be divided between government and contractor personnel. We also found that 
the Coast Guard had not adequately staffed its program management function. De-
spite  some  actions  taken  to  more  fully  staff  the  Deepwater  program,  we  reported 
that in January 2005 shortfalls remained. While 244 positions were assigned to the 
program, only 206 were filled, resulting in a 16 percent vacancy rate. 

One  of  the  key  program  management  concerns  we  had,  and  one  that  is  worth 
highlighting,  is  the  effectiveness  of  IPTs.  IPTs  are  the  Coast  Guard’s  primary  tool 
for  managing  the  Deepwater  program  and  overseeing  the  system  integrator.  Our 
past  work  has  found  that  IPTs  can  improve  both  the  speed  and  quality  of  the  deci-
sion-making process. 7 They can make decisions involving significant trade-offs with-
out  relying  unduly  on  other  organizations  for  information  or  approval.  In  our  prior 
work, we studied successful IPTs in commercial firms and found that effective teams 
have:  (1)  expertise  to  master  different  facets  of  product  development,  (2)  responsi-
bility for day-to-day decisions and product delivery, (3) key members who are either 
physically  colocated  or  connected  through  virtual  means  to  facilitate  team  cohesion 
and  the  ability  to  share  information,  and  (4)  control  over  their  membership,  with 
membership changes driven by each team’s need for different knowledge. 

We identified two elements as essential to determining whether a team is in fact 
an IPT: the knowledge and authority needed to recognize problems and make cross- 
cutting decisions expeditiously. Knowledge is sufficient when the team has the right 
mix  of  expertise  to  master  the  different  facets  of  product  development.  Authority  is 
present  when  the  team  is  responsible  for  making  both  day-to-day  decisions  and  de-
livering  the  product.  If  the  programs  are  experiencing  problems,  the  teams  either 
did  not  have  the  authority  or  the  right  mix  of  expertise  to  be  considered  IPTs.  If 
a  team  lacks  expertise,  it  will  miss  opportunities  to  recognize  potential  problems 
early; without authority, it can do little about them. 

The  Deepwater  IPTs—comprised  of  Coast  Guard,  ICGS,  and  subcontractor  em-
ployees from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman—are responsible for overall 
program  planning  and  management,  asset  integration,  and  overseeing  the  delivery 
of  specific  Deepwater  assets.  We  reported  in  2004  that  the  teams  had  struggled  to 
effectively  carry  out  their  missions.  We  identified  four  major  issues  that  had  im-
peded the effective performance of the IPTs: 

• First, the teams lacked timely charters to vest them with authority for decision-
making. More than merely a paperwork exercise, sound IPT charters are critical 
because  they  detail  each  team’s  purpose,  membership,  performance  goals,  au-
thority,  responsibility,  accountability,  and  relationships  with  other  groups,  re-
sources, and schedules. 
• Second,  the  system  integrator  had  difficulty  training  IPT  members  in  time  to 
ensure  that  they  could  effectively  carry  out  their  duties,  and  program  officials 
referred  to  IPT  training  as  deficient.  IPT  training  is  to  address,  among  other 
issues,  developing  team  goals  and  objectives,  key  processes,  use  of  a  web-based 
system  intended  to  facilitate  communication,  and  team  rules  of  behavior.  Ac-
cording  to  a  Coast  Guard  evaluation  report  from  December  2002,  IPT  training 
had been implemented late, which contributed to a lack of effective collaboration 
among team members. 
• Third, very few of the operating IPTs were entirely colocated, (that is, all mem-
bers  were  not  in  the  same  building)  even  though  the  Coast  Guard’s  Deepwater 
program  management  plan  identified  colocation  of  IPT  members  as  a  key  pro-
gram  success  factor,  along  with  effective  communications  within  and  among 
teams. ICGS developed a web-based system for government and contractor em-

ployees  to  regularly  access  and  update  technical  delivery  task  order 8 informa-
tion, training materials, and other program information, in part to mitigate the 
challenges  of  having  team  members  in  multiple  locations.  However,  the  Deep-
water  program  executive  officer  reported  that,  while  the  system  had  great  po-
tential,  it  was  a  long  way  from  becoming  the  virtual  enterprise  and  collabo-
rative environment required by the contractor’s statement of work. 
• Fourth, we reported that most of the Deepwater IPTs had experienced member-
ship  turnover  and  staffing  difficulties,  resulting  in  a  loss  of  team  knowledge, 
overbooked  schedules,  and  crisis  management.  In  a  few  instances,  such  as  the 
National Security Cutter and maritime patrol aircraft, even the IPT leadership 
had changed. 

In  2005,  we  found  that  the  Coast  Guard  had  taken  some  positive  steps  in  that: 
(1) the IPTs had been restructured, (2) 20 IPTs had charters setting forth their pur-
pose, authority, and performance goals, and (3) entry-level training had been imple-
mented  for  team  members.  However,  some  of  the  problems  continued.  A  Coast 
Guard  assessment  of  the  system  integrator’s  performance  found  that  roles  and  re-
sponsibilities in some teams continued to be unclear. Decisionmaking was to a large 
extent  stove-piped,  and  some  teams  lacked  adequate  authority  to  make  decisions 
within their realm of responsibility. One source of difficulty for some team members 
was  that  each  of  the  two  major  subcontractors  has  used  its  own  management  sys-
tems and processes to manage different segments of the program. 

In  2005,  we  also  noted  that  decisions  on  air  assets  were  made  by  Lockheed  Mar-
tin, while decisions regarding surface assets were made by Northrop Grumman. We 
reported  that  this  approach  can  lessen  the  likelihood  that  a  system-of-systems  out-
come will be achieved if decisions affecting the entire program are made without the 
full consultation of all parties involved. In 2006, we reported that Coast Guard offi-
cials  believed  collaboration  among  the  subcontractors  to  be  problematic  and  that 
ICGS  wielded  little  influence  to  compel  decisions  among  them.  For  example,  when 
dealing with proposed design changes to assets under construction, ICGS submitted 
the changes as two separate proposals from both subcontractors rather than coordi-
nating the separate proposals into one coherent plan. According to Coast Guard per-
formance  monitors,  this  approach  complicates  the  government  review  of  design 
changes  because  the  two  proposals  often  carried  overlapping  work  items,  thereby 
forcing the Coast Guard to act as the system integrator in those situations. 
Contractor Accountability 

In  2004,  we  also  made  recommendations  related  to  contractor  accountability.  We 
found that the Coast Guard had not developed quantifiable metrics to hold the sys-
tem  integrator  accountable  for  its  ongoing  performance  and  that  the  process  by 
which  the  Coast  Guard  assessed  performance  after  the  first  year  of  the  contract 
lacked  rigor.  For  example,  the  first  annual  award  fee  determination  was  based 
largely on unsupported calculations. Despite documented problems in schedule, per-
formance,  cost  control,  and  contract  administration  throughout  the  first  year,  the 
program  executive  officer  awarded  the  contractor  an  overall  rating  of  87  percent, 
which fell in the ‘‘very good’’ range. This rating resulted in an award fee of $4.0 mil-
lion of the maximum of $4.6 million. 

We  also  reported  in  2004  that  the  Coast  Guard  had  not  begun  to  measure  the 
system  integrator’s  performance  on  the  three  overarching  goals  of  the  Deepwater 
program—maximizing  operational  effectiveness,  minimizing  total  ownership  costs, 
and  satisfying  the  customers.  Coast  Guard  officials  told  us  that  metrics  for  meas-
uring  these  objectives  had  not  been  finalized;  therefore  the  officials  could  not  accu-
rately  assess  the  contractor’s  performance  against  the  goals.  However,  at  the  time, 
the Coast Guard had no timeframe in which to accomplish this measurement. 
Cost Control Through Competition 

Further,  our  2004  report  had  recommendations  related  to  cost  control.  We  re-
ported  that,  although  competition  among  subcontractors  was  a  key  vehicle  for  con-
trolling  costs,  the  Coast  Guard  had  neither  measured  the  extent  of  competition 
among the suppliers of Deepwater assets nor held the system integrator accountable 
for  taking  steps  to  achieve  competition. 9 As  the  two  major  subcontractors  to  ICGS, 
Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman  have  sole  responsibility  for  determining 
whether  to  provide  the  Deepwater  assets  themselves  or  to  hold  competitions—deci-
sions  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘‘make-or-buy.’’  We  noted  that  the  Coast  Guard’s

orders for supplies or services placed against the contract.

hands-off  approach  to  make-or-buy  decisions  and  its  failure  to  assess  the  extent  of 
competition raised questions about whether the government would be able to control 
Deepwater program costs. 
Coast Guard Efforts Related to GAO Recommendations 

We made 11 recommendations in 2004 in the areas of management and oversight, 
contractor accountability, and cost control through competition. Table 1 provides de-
tails on these recommendations.

• revise the Deepwater human capital plan; 
• develop measurable award fee criteria; 
• implement  a  more  rigorous  method  of  obtaining  input  from  Coast  Guard  mon-

itors on the contractor’s performance; 

• include  in  the  contractor’s  performance  measures  actions  taken  to  improve  the 
integrated product teams’ effectiveness; and require the contractor to notify the 
Coast  Guard  of  subcontracts  over  $10  million  that  were  awarded  to  the  two 
major subcontractors. 10 

The Coast Guard had begun to address five other recommendations by: 
• initiating  actions  to  establish  charters  and  training  for  integrated  product 

• improving  communications  with  field  personnel  regarding  the  transition  to 

teams; 

Deepwater assets; 

• devising a timeframe for measuring the contractor’s progress toward improving 

operational effectiveness; 

• establishing criteria to determine when to adjust the project baseline; and 
• developing a plan to hold the contractor accountable for ensuring adequate com-

petition among suppliers. 

In  our  April  2006  report,  we  determined  that,  based  on  our  work,  these  rec-

ommendations had not been fully implemented. 

The  Coast  Guard  disagreed  with  and  declined  to  implement  one  of  our  11  rec-
ommendations:  to  establish  a  baseline  to  determine  whether  the  system-of-systems 
acquisition  approach  is  costing  the  government  more  than  the  traditional  asset  re-
placement approach. 

We will continue to review Deepwater implementation and contract oversight. We 
are currently reviewing aspects of the Deepwater program for the House and Senate 
Appropriations  Committees’  Subcommittees  on  Homeland  Security. 11 As  part  of 
that  effort,  we  will  review  the  status  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  implementation  of  our 
2004  recommendations  on  Deepwater  contract  management  for  improving  Deep-
water  program  management,  holding  the  prime  contractor  accountable  for  meeting 
key  program  goals  and  facilitating  cost  control  through  competition.  We  will  share 
our results with those committees in April of this year. 
Performance  and  Design  Problems  Creating  Operational  Challenges  for 

Coast Guard 

In  addition  to  overall  management  issues  discussed  above,  there  have  been  prob-
lems  with  the  performance  and  design  of  Deepwater  patrol  boats  that  pose  signifi-
cant operational challenges to the Coast Guard. 
Performance Problems With the Converted 123-Foot Patrol Boats 

The  Deepwater  program’s  conversion  of  the  legacy  110-foot  patrol  boats  to  123- 
foot  patrol  boats  has  encountered  performance  problems.  The  Coast  Guard  had 
originally  intended  to  convert  all  49  of  its  110-foot  patrol  boats  into  123-foot  patrol 
boats  in  order  to  increase  the  patrol  boats’  annual  operational  hours.  This  conver-
sion program was also intended to add additional capability to the patrol boats, such 
as enhanced and improved C4ISR capabilities, as well as stern launch and recovery 
capability  for  a  small  boat.  However,  the  converted  123-foot  patrol  boats  began  to 
display  deck  cracking  and  hull  buckling  and  developed  shaft  alignment  problems, 
and  the  Coast  Guard  elected  to  stop  the  conversion  process  at  eight  hulls  upon  de-
termining  that  the  converted  patrol  boats  would  not  meet  their  expanded  post-9/11 
operational requirements. 

The  performance  problems  illustrated  above  have  clear  operational  consequences 
for  the  Coast  Guard.  The  hull  performance  problems  with  the  123-foot  patrol  boats 
led  the  Coast  Guard  to  remove  all  of  the  eight  converted  normal  123-foot  patrol 
boats  from  service  effective  November  30,  2006.  The  Commandant  of  the  Coast 
Guard has stated that having reliable, safe cutters is ‘‘paramount’’ to executing the 

10 Our 2004 recommendation was to use a $5 million threshold because Lockheed Martin, one 
of  the  major  subcontractors,  uses  that  amount  as  the  threshold  for  considering  its  suppliers 
major.  The  Coast  Guard  decided  to  use  the  $10  million  threshold  based  on  the  criteria  in  the 
make-or-buy program provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 

11 This  work  is  based  on  Conference  Committee  Report  language  (H.R.  Conf.  Rep.  No.  109– 
699, at 113 (2006)) incorporating GAO reporting provisions contained in a House Appropriations

Coast  Guard’s  missions. 12 Thus,  removing  these  patrol  boats  from  service  impacts 
Coast  Guard’s  operations  in  its  missions,  such  as  search  and  rescue  and  migrant 
interdiction.  The  Coast  Guard  is  exploring  options  to  address  operational  gaps  re-
sulting from the suspension of the 123-foot patrol boat operations. 
Design Problems With the Fast Response Cutter 

The FRC—which was intended as a long-term replacement for the legacy 110-foot 
patrol  boats—has  experienced  design  problems  that  have  operational  implications. 
As  we  recently  reported,  the  Coast  Guard  suspended  design  work  on  the  FRC  due 
to  design  risks  such  as  excessive  weight  and  horsepower  requirements. 13 Coast 
Guard  engineers  raised  concerns  about  the  viability  of  the  FRC  design  (which  in-
volved  building  the  FRC’s  hull,  decks,  and  bulkheads  out  of  composite  materials 
rather  than  steel)  beginning  in  January  2005.  In  February  2006,  the  Coast  Guard 
suspended FRC design work after an independent design review by third-party con-
sultants demonstrated, among other things, that the FRC would be far heavier and 
less  efficient  than  a  typical  patrol  boat  of  similar  length,  in  part,  because  it  would 
need four engines to meet Coast Guard speed requirements. 

One  operational  challenge  related  to  the  FRC,  is  that  the  Coast  Guard  will  end 
up  with  two  classes  of  FRCs.  The  first  class  of  FRCs  to  be  built  would  be  based  on 
an  adapted  design  from  a  patrol  boat  already  on  the  market  to  expedite  delivery. 
The  Coast  Guard  would  then  pursue  development  of  a  follow-on  class  that  would 
be completely redesigned to address the problems in the original FRC design plans. 
Coast  Guard  officials  now  estimate  that  the  first  FRC  delivery  will  slip  to  Fiscal 
Year  2009,  at  the  earliest,  rather  than  2007  as  outlined  in  the  2005  Revised  Deep-
water Implementation Plan. Thus, the Coast Guard is also facing longer-term oper-
ational  gaps  related  to  its  patrol  boats.  In  regard  to  the  suspension  of  FRC  design 
work, as of our June 2006 report, Coast Guard officials had not yet determined how 
changes  in  the  design  and  delivery  date  for  the  FRC  would  affect  the  operations  of 
the overall system-of-systems approach. 

We  will  continue  to  review  Coast  Guard  operational  challenges  related  to  Deep-
water  patrol  boats.  Our  ongoing  work  for  the  House  and  Senate  Appropriations 
Committees’  Subcommittees  on  Homeland  Security  includes  a  review  of  the  history 
of the contract, design, fielding, and grounding of the converted 123-foot patrol boats 
and operational adjustments the Coast Guard is making to account for the removal 
from service of the 123-foot patrol boats. 

Madam  Chair,  that  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  respond  to  any 

questions you or other members of the Subcommittee may have at this time. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Caldwell,  and  thank  you  to 
all  of  the  panelists.  We’re  going  to  do  5-minute  rounds,  here.  And 
we  do  have  a  second  panel,  and  I  think  we’re  going  to  have  some 
votes  later  this  afternoon,  so  I  want  to  make  sure  we  all  have 
enough  time.  So  we’ll  make  a  judgment  after  the  first  round, 
whether we do two rounds of questions with this panel, or go to the 
second panel. 

So,  I  want  to  start—Mr.  Skinner  and  Mr.  Caldwell—you  both 
have  been  students  of  this  Deepwater  Program  and  the  system  in-
tegrator approach. 

First  of  all,  I  just  want  to  clarify,  Mr.  Skinner,  have  you  gotten 
access  to  all  of  the  e-mails  and  documentation  that  you  need  from 
the Coast Guard? 

Mr. SKINNER. Yes, we have. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  You  have,  at  this  point  in  time,  all  the 

doc—— 

Mr. SKINNER. At this point in time, we have, yes. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  And,  Admiral  Allen,  if  the  Committee  would 
like  to  see  additional  e-mails  or  correspondence,  I’m  assuming  you 
would comply with that, thank you.

To this recommendation by the Defense University, they have ba-
sically said that this issue of lead-system integrator is problematic. 
I  think  that  Mr.  Caldwell  and  Mr.  Skinner,  you  were  saying  the 
same things. 

But, could you elaborate on whether you think that you can just 
make  small  changes  to  the  current  contract  moving  forward  with 
that  system  integrator?  Or  whether  we  need  to  make  more  sub-
stantive changes to get this approach right? 

Mr.  SKINNER.  I  believe  there  are  going  to  have  to  be  some  sub-
stantive changes made to the contract to make it an effective initia-
tive. First of all, we’re going to have—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  don’t  mean  with,  I  mean,  not  necessarily 
with the current contractee, but with any individual, any organiza-
tion.  Obviously,  the  debate  here  is  on  the  normal  procurement 
process  that  the  Coast  Guard  had  followed  prior  to  this  rec-
ommendation, this novel idea of using a system of taking the SAM 
and  throwing  it  out,  and  using  the  system  integration  to  get  the 
expertise to the Coast Guard. 

Mr.  SKINNER.  Yes,  for  one  thing,  I  think  the  system  of  systems 
concept  is  a  good  one.  I  think  using  any  performance-based  con-
tract mechanism is a good one. I think it’s very important that the 
government  partner  with  the  private  sector,  they  bring  energy, 
they  bring  innovation,  they  bring  a  lot  to  the  table  that  we  in  the 
government  cannot  provide.  So  I  think,  conceptually,  it’s  an  excel-
lent  idea.  Any  time  you  do  something  like  this,  there’s  going  to  be 
risk associated with it, it needs to be managed closely. The contract 
terms  have  to  be  well-defined,  the  government  needs  to  be  able  to 
be  in  a  position  to  dictate  to  the  contractor,  or  have  at  least  some 
involvement  or  insight  to  sub-contract  management  and  make-or- 
buy decisions, things of that nature. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  The  system  integrator  giving  a  contract  to 
themselves?  Obviously,  we  saw  in  the  Fast  Response  Cutter,  you 
know  $25  million  later  we  had  to  stop  work  on  that  particular  de-
sign.  That  was  an  area  where  they  didn’t  necessarily  have  the  ex-
pertise, but contracted with themselves, is that correct? 

Mr.  SKINNER.  That  is  correct.  In  this  regard,  I  think  that  the 
Coast Guard or the government needs to play a larger role in man-
aging these particular type of contracts. We need to have the tech-
nical  expertise  to  review  designs,  to  make  decisions,  and  not  rely 
on  a  contractor  to  tell  us  what  we  want,  and  what  we’re  going  to 
receive. 

It’s our responsibility to define what we want, and what we want 
to  receive.  If  they  propose  something  that  doesn’t  meet  our  stand-
ards, then we should not accept it, we should not move forward. 

We  need  third-party  assessments.  I  understand,  under  the 
FRC—we did not do any work there yet, GAO has been doing some 
work  there—it’s  my  understanding  that  we  knew  early  on  that 
there  may  be  some  problems  with  the  FRC.  We  need  independent 
assessments to guide us, as to whether we should proceed, and in-
vest,  considerable  resources  early  on  in  the  process,  and  not  wait 
2 years down the road before we realize that, that the end product 
is not going to work. 

Senator CANTWELL. Mr. Caldwell?

Mr.  CALDWELL.  I  would  agree  with  Mr.  Skinner,  GAO  is  doing 
some  broader  work  on  both  defense  and  other  DHS  programs  to 
look  at  the  concept  of  this  lead-system  integrator.  We’re  not  ready 
to report on that work yet. 

But the concept itself can be sound, it’s the implementation of it 
that has been problematic. Getting some independent input, wheth-
er  through  the  Coast  Guard’s  own  technical  authority,  or  through 
third-party assessments, is one way to reduce risks. 

One  of  the  key  things  that  the  Coast  Guard  lost  along  the  way 
was  the  voice  of  their  own  technical  authority,  and  Admiral  Allen 
has  worked  to  reassert  that  technical  authority.  I  think  it  will  be 
very  interesting  to  hear  Captain  Jarvis’  statement  later  today 
about the erosion of the Coast Guard’s internal technical authority 
and the impact he said that had to give free reign to the lead inte-
grator. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Isn’t  that  a  little  bit  of  an  understatement, 
Mr. Caldwell? Given the millions of dollars that we are now seeing 
in  three  different  vessels  that  aren’t  performing,  either  because  of 
design, or because of now, structural questions for the future? 

Mr.  CALDWELL.  Perhaps  it  is  an  understatement,  but  we  have 
noted  these  types  of  flaws  in  the  program.  For  example,  we  noted 
that  one  of  the  key  things  that  have  been  missing  has  been  cost 
control.  We  have  a  situation  now  where  the  Coast  Guard  is  not  in 
a  position  to  adequately  measure  or  ensure  cost  control  through 
subcontracting—that should be a part of the structure that is being 
put in place right now. There are also weaknesses in terms of con-
tractor  accountability.  As  Mr.  Skinner  said,  you  can  bring  that 
problem back to the requirements, and how well those are defined, 
or how poorly they’re defined, in this case. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Your  area  of  expertise  is  in  homeland  secu-

rity as well? 

Mr. CALDWELL. Correct. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  And,  have  we  seen  anything  similar  to  this 
in  other  areas  of  homeland  security,  or  at  least  this  scale?  To  me, 
we’ve  moved  outside  of  what  had  been—you  know,  if  you  look  at 
the  history  of  the  Coast  Guard  and  their  procurements  over  the— 
the buoy system, the HEALY—you know, we’re talking about a lot 
smaller  acquisitions.  And,  all  of  a  sudden,  this  large-scale  acquisi-
tion  comes  along,  and  I’ll  get  more  into  that  theory  of  why  I  think 
that it, perhaps, got to that point, and you’re right, abandoned the 
technical expertise internally. And now, in looking at solutions, you 
have  to  go  back  and  ask  whether  that  technical  expertise  for  this 
large-scale of a program—$24 billion across many assets. 

Mr. CALDWELL. There are two other homeland security programs 
the  GAO  is  doing  work  on  that  we  have  started  to  raise  similar 
concerns, one is the SBI Net Program, and the other one is the Se-
cure Flight Program. 

Senator CANTWELL. So, are you seeing similar issues? 
Mr. CALDWELL. We are seeing similar issues. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Senator Snowe? 
Senator SNOWE. Admiral Allen, in reading through the Inspector 
General’s  report,  and  looking  through  the  time-line  first  it  was  in 
March  2004,  that  the  Coast  Guard  Chief  Engineer  raised  signifi-

cant concerns with the structural design of the NSC, and the anal-
ysis was supported by two renowned Naval engineers. 

46 

And  then  in  January  2005,  another  internal  Coast  Guard  memo 
states  that  several  of  the  issues  remain  which  degrade  the  oper-
ational capability, reduce the NCS service life to less than 30 years, 
I know that’s an issue in dispute, whether or not that was the ulti-
mate goal was 20 years, 30 years and that’s something we have to 
talk  about,  and  also  in  the  operational  days,  as  opposed  to  230  to 
175  to  180—but  nevertheless,  that  was  the  original  goal  of  the 
NCS. 

Finally, at a briefing delivered to the Coast Guard Commandant 
in  May  2006,  it  might  have  been—is  that  before  you  came  on?  It 
must  have  been,  just  shortly  before  you  came  on.  More  than  2 
years  after  the  issues  regarding  the  NSC  were  first  raised,  the 
Deepwater program manager concludes the NCS would not be com-
pliant with the performance requirements. 

Through  this  whole  period,  work  continued  on  the  NSC.  The 
Coast  Guard’s  response,  and  the  IG  report  is  widely  continued, 
where pre-production activities were already underway, any disrup-
tion  in  the  normal  production  effort  would  have  been  very  costly. 
The independent analysis has provided conclusive evidence of defi-
ciencies that the systems integrator would be responsible to correct 
them—not at their cost, I gather. 

Given  the  uncertainty  of  the  structural  concerns,  and  the  ur-
gency of delivering the NSC, the Program Office decided to proceed 
with production. 

Knowing  that  there  was  an  ongoing,  serious  debate  about  the 
National  Security  Cutter—and  we  knew  that  within—we’re  going 
to  hear  testimony  from  the  subsequent  panel,  regarding  that  back 
as  far  as  2004,  Mr.  Caldwell  said  2003—why  is  it?  What  is  your 
understanding as to why the Coast Guard continued? 

I  mean,  this  is  a  major  problem.  You  know,  when  you’re  talking 
about  rising  costs  from  $500  to  $700  to  $900  million,  in  the  final 
analysis it is still undetermined who is going to pay for this. I un-
derstand we’re talking about a cost-plus in this instance, so for the 
first  two  cutters  we  had  to  do  these  modifications.  Obviously  that 
was  understood,  certainly  nothing  was  brought  before  this  com-
mittee. That’s what’s so disturbing. 

Not  brought  before  this  committee.  About  all  of  these  modifica-
tions, they said, ‘‘Well, we’ll do it after we construct the NSC.’’ And 
not even to meet the 30-year life, or the operational days, the origi-
nal  goal  of  230  days.  And  we’ve  just  got  undetermined  costs  now. 
So  what  is  it  that  happened  within  the  Coast  Guard  that  would 
have  allowed  this  to  continue,  unabated  for  such  a  long  period  of 
time? 

Admiral ALLEN. I think there are two things, Senator. One is the 
decision itself, and then the documentation of the decision. The In-
spector  General  has  pointed  out  that  there  is  no  auditable  and 
traceable  record,  and  one  of  the  things  that’s  very  frustrating  in 
this  is—and  I  think  it  was  generally  well-known  in  the  Coast 
Guard,  and  I’m  going  to  characterize  the  decision  because  it  was 
documented,  and  it  is  not  auditable.  But  to  the  best  of  my  knowl-
edge,  my  assessment  at  the  time  would  have  been  the  impact  on 
schedule, and the implications for cost were considered to be unre-

47 

coverable,  and  any  issues  associated  with  fatigue-life  could  be 
retro-fitted back into the first and second hulls, added to the design 
of the third hull. 

Lacking a business case analysis, a decision memo, anything that 
could  be  audited  by  the  IG  has  been  problematic.  I  can  tell  you 
this—just because I was in staff meetings and was privy to the dis-
cussions, it was known that the decision was to proceed, and retro- 
fitting  the  design  changes  that  might  be  required  in  the  first  or 
second  hull,  that  was  not  documented,  and  therefore  is  not  trace-
able or auditable. 

Two  other  issues  that  you  raised,  the  first  one—days  away  from 
home  port—the  Inspector  General  and  I  both  agree  there  was  am-
biguity  in  the  contract.  The  contract  established  that  the  cutter 
would  be  away  from  home  port  for  230  days,  the  remaining  days 
would  be  allocated  for  maintenance.  If  you  take  out  transit  times, 
port  calls  during  patrols  and  so  forth,  that  yields  you  about  185 
days  on  mission,  if  you  will,  in  the  sea  state  by  which  the  models 
were  subjecting  the  hulls  to  for  developing  the  fatigue-life  stand-
ards. 

This  has  been  a  subject  of  some  misconceptions,  ambiguity,  and 
so  forth.  We  have  clarified  that  in  the  contract,  and  reported  that 
to the IG. But, by the contract, it is 230 days away from home port, 
185 days on station, conducting mission, and those are the param-
eters  by  which  the  models  are  applied  for,  how  long  the  sea  stay 
would  act  on  the  hull  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  fatigue- 
life. If you use 230 days, it requires a much longer fatigue-life than 
it would for 185 days, to achieve 30 years. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Mr.  Skinner,  what  is  your  response  to  that?  On 

the fatigue-life? 

Mr.  SKINNER.  The  contract  was  very  clear  in  saying  that  the 
specifications  we  were  going  to  construct—we,  the  government— 
were  going  to  construct  a  cutter  that  would  have  an  underway  ca-
pability of 230 days. That, if you use the rules of navigation, when 
you say 230 days underway, you’re saying ‘‘on mission,’’ ‘‘on assign-
ment,’’ ‘‘anchors up.’’ 

The  Contracting  Officer,  the  Program  Manager,  and  the  Assist-
ant  Commandant  for  Systems  all  were  operating  under  the  as-
sumption  that  this  vessel  was  being  built  to  be  underway  for  230 
days. It was not brought to light, at least in formal documentation, 
that  there  was  confusion  that  no,  we  were  talking  about  230  days 
away  from  home  port,  185  days  at  sea.  We  brought  this  to  the 
Coast  Guard’s  attention,  saying  that  there  is  confusion  within  the 
Coast Guard, confusion with those that are assessing the capability 
of  the  vessel,  Carderock  and  others,  and  unless  you  clarified—and 
if you, if your intention was to make it 185 days and then 230 days 
away  from  home  port,  then  it  needs—you  need  to,  sort  of,  state 
that  in  the  contract,  and  you  need  to  do  that  now.  In  which,  I  un-
derstand that adjustment has been made to the contract. 

Admiral ALLEN. Senator, if I could just make one clarifying com-
ment,  and  I’d  be  glad  to  provide  a  more  extensive  answer  for  the 
record. We issued a task order to Carderock, an air-to-surface war-
fare center, to conduct a finite element analysis and do an analysis 
of  the  fatigue-life  of  the  ship.  We  did  not  prescribe  to  them  the 
number  of  underway  days  in  the  work  order  that  was  issued  to 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

48 

them.  They  assumed  230  days  underway  in  the  operating  environ-
ment, because of ambiguities in the contract. 

[The information referred to follows:] 
The premise for this is: 

230 DAFHP—new Days Away From Home Port (DAFHP) target. 
185 DAFHP—is the current fleet target. 

In terms of on station time: 

230 DAFHP translates into approximately 170–180 days on station annually. 
185 DAFHP translates into approximately 100–120 days on station annually. 

170–180 days on station in the North Pacific will involve significantly more stress 
cycles  at  a  higher  stress  level  than  100–120  days  on  station  in  an  unspecified  loca-
tion. 

When  that  was  returned  to  the  Coast  Guard,  our  technical  au-
thority, our Chief Engineer, corrected the model to reflect 185 days, 
that’s  when  we  found  out  there  were  differing  assumptions,  and 
had to correct them in the contract. 

Senator SNOWE. Thank you. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Senator Lautenberg? 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  It’s  hard—it’s  mystifying  here,  I  must  tell 
you, to figure out what went wrong, to the degree that things have 
been  wrong.  Not  only  have  we  thrown  lots  of  money  at  it,  but  we 
don’t  have  a  satisfactory  product  to  look  at,  and  if  I’ve  ever  seen 
an  example  of  the  fox  in  the  chicken  coop,  this  is  it.  I  mean,  the 
systems  integrator  looking  at  how  the  job  is  going  and  making 
those  decisions:  it’s  outrageous.  And  that  kind  of  an  example,  I 
can’t  imagine  being  used  in  the  corporate  world,  but  I  guess  any-
thing is possible. 

Admiral,  has  this  system  of  contracting  outlived  its  usefulness, 
given  this  experience?  Turning  key  procurement  decisions  over  to 
a  contractor  that  has  a  vested  interest  in  the  manufacturer/devel-
oper of a product? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  Well,  I  would  agree  with  the  Inspector  General 
and the General Accountability Office that it’s not so much a mat-
ter of the strategy or the acquisition vehicle, it is a matter of execu-
tion, how the contract is structured, and how it’s overseen. 

I  would  tell  you  this—that  there  are  large,  complex  acquisitions 
that  need  to  take  place  in  the  Federal  Government,  and  there  will 
be more in the Department of Homeland Security and I think it is 
a  matter  of  understanding  how  you  do  a  performance-based  sys-
tems  integration  contract,  and  get  it  right,  because  it’s  a  com-
petency we’re going to have to have, not only the Coast Guard, but 
the Department of Homeland Security moving forward. 

So, in my view, it’s not a matter of the strategy or the approach, 
it’s  getting  it  right  with  the  right  oversight  and  doing  our  jobs  on 
the side of the Federal Government, Senator. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  OK,  but  the  oversight  has  to  be  realisti-
cally  done.  Were  you  aware  of  any  demands  or  requests  by  the 
Coast  Guard  for  help  and  oversight  or  auditing  what  was  taking 
place?  Was  that  request  ever  put  to  the  Administration  leaders 
through OMB or anyone? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  We  have  sequentially  increased  the  staffing  of 
the program, and I can give you a multi-year staffing ladder, if you

will, for the record. And we’ve increased it to the point now, where 
we  have  about  300  people  in  our  AC&I  budget  that  are  budgeted 
toward  this  project.  About  two-thirds  of  the  interaction  on  the 
project  staff,  the  other  100  are  out  in  operating  programs  where, 
in our engineering or operations department to help this. We have 
significantly  increased  the  staffing,  actually,  I  think  we’re  on  the 
threshold  where,  if  properly  organized,  we  can  have  a  significant 
impact  on  how  this  project  is  managed.  But  we’re  going  to  have  to 
change our business rules and practices.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  But,  I  don’t  know  whether—300  sounds 

like a lot, but who knows from a distance whether it is—— 

Admiral ALLEN. It’s more than the 160 we started with, sir. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Well, when I hear the confusion about how 
many  days  of  service  the  cutter  is  designed  for,  it’s  kind  of  sur-
prising. I didn’t realize the ratio of maintenance to service days for 
the  cutter  was  quite  that  high.  It  comes  down  almost  one  for  one 
in a year. Is 185 days some kind of compromise here? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  The  breakdown,  Senator,  is  135  maintenance 
days,  and  then  230  days  away  from  home  port.  The  difference  in 
the  middle  is  you  don’t  leave  home  port  and  get  beamed  out  to 
where  you’re  going  to  do  the  mission.  You  have,  sometimes  to  get 
to  the  Bering  Sea  it  may  take  2  or  3  weeks  to  get  up  there,  you 
may have to make a mid-patrol break to take on fuel and for other 
logistics.  But  what  we’re  saying  is  the  230  days  away  from  home 
port  will  yield  you  about  185  days  at  a  remote  location,  doing  the 
mission.  In  the  meantime,  the  transit  cost,  the  transit  time  is  ac-
crued. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. I don’t know whether, as a universal rule, 
that  can  be  applied  to  a  fairly  complicated  piece  of  equipment  like 
these ships, but it seems like a lot of time for not very effective use 
of the vessel. Are your standards for maintenance and refurbishing 
similar to that used in the Navy? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  Sir,  I  might  compare  it  to  our  current  practice, 
let’s  take  a  378-foot  cutter,  home  port  in  Alameda.  Our  standard 
is  to  program  185  days  away  from  home  port  a  year.  That  is  con-
strained  by  what  we  call  ‘‘personnel  tempo.’’  By  policy,  we  don’t 
keep  our  people  away  from  home  any  more  than  185  days  a  year. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

50 

That,  constructively,  yields  us  about  135  mission  days,  if  you  put 
in the transit time that I talked about before. 

How  are  you  going  to  get  230  days  away  from  home  port,  and 
increase  mission  time?  The  National  Security  Cutters  will  be  the 
multi-crew. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Admiral, the question I’m going to ask you 
is  before  your  term  as  Commandant,  but  there  was  a  memo  from 
Admiral  Brown  that  was  issued  in  2004,  concerning  design  defi-
ciencies for the National Security Cutter, are you familiar? 

Admiral ALLEN. I am familiar with that. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Now, there was a whistle-blower that was 
involved  with  this.  Is  there  whistle-blower  protection  for  people 
who  come  forward  to  point  out  wrongdoings  that  are  happening? 
Or,  could  personnel  be  afraid  of  the  consequences  of  their  state-
ments or their information being let out? 

Admiral ALLEN. Well, there certainly is in my Coast Guard, Sen-
ator.  I’m  not  sure  if  there  was  a  whistle-blower  status  attached  to 
this, I can tell you this—the issues that related to the National Se-
curity  Cutter  design,  in  my  view,  were  raised  by  the  engineering 
community, there was not an effective way to reconcile those inside 
the  Coast  Guard,  you’re  going  to  hear  Captain  Jarvis  talk  about 
that at the next panel. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Right. 
Admiral  ALLEN.  I  thought—now,  this  is  my  own  opinion,  now— 
that we actually created a cultural cleavage in the Coast Guard by 
the  way  this  thing  was  organized,  where  we  disenfranchised  the 
technical authority, didn’t bring them in to be inclusive in the solu-
tion,  and  therefore,  they  had  no  recourse  but  to  keep  raising  the 
level of complaint about this to the point where the Chief Engineer 
actually  wrote  a  memo  on  it,  and  then  there  was  no  business  case 
analysis,  or  memo  to  establish  why  we  would  not  do  that.  That  is 
a  central  point  in  this  whole  audit,  and  the  whole  decision  on  the 
NSC, sir. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Admiral. 
Thanks, Madam Chair. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Senator Vitter? 
Senator VITTER. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
Admiral,  I  want  to  go  back  to  the  two  central  themes  I  men-
tioned  earlier  in  my  opening  comments,  which  both  relate  to  the 
110′  to  123′  conversion.  When  this  was  happening,  were  you  per-
sonally  aware  of  this  proposal  coming  out  of  the  shipyard  actually 
doing  the  work,  that  around  the  fourth  ship,  they  realized,  ‘‘You 
know, these old hulls are just too worn and brittle, we need a new 
solution.’’ And they actually had a specific proposal to provide new 
hulls  for  an  extra  million  dollars,  $5  million  instead  of  $4  million. 
Were you aware of that, and what was the analysis of that, that 

led to it being rejected? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  Senator,  I’m  going  to  give  you  a  two-part  an-
swer,  if  I  can.  I  was,  informally  aware  that  Bollinger  had  created 
an  alternative  by  which  they  would  renew  the  hulls,  the  extended 
123′. 

I’d  like  to  answer,  for  the  record,  whether  or  not  that  got  to  the 
Coast Guard, and how we acted upon it, because it was interrupted

in  my  deployment  down  South  for  the  response  to  Katrina.  So,  if 
I  could  answer  for  the  record—I  was  aware  that  Bollinger  had  an 
alternative proposal to renew the hulls. 
[The information referred to follows:] 
The  Coast  Guard  was  aware  of  one  informal  presentation  by  Bollinger  Shipyard, 
Inc. (BSI) to Vice Admiral Peterman (then RADM Peterman) in August 2004. Addi-
tionally, ICGS made an informal presentation to the Commandant (Admiral Collins) 
in September 2004. Both of these informal verbal presentations involved completely 
replacing  the  metal  hull  of  the  123′  instead  of  only  replacing  a  portion  of  the  hull. 
The  Coast  Guard  did  a  preliminary  review  based  on  the  very  limited  information 
presented. 

Based  on  that  situation,  the  Coast  Guard  verbally  responded  that  the  risk  of  so 
many  unknowns  did  not  allow  the  Coast  Guard  to  make  any  decision  on  the  value 
of this approach. BSI and ICGS were advised that if this approach truly had merit, 
then  an  ‘‘Unsolicited  Proposal’’  in  accordance  with  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regula-
tions  should  be  sent  to  the  Coast  Guard.  Neither  firm  submitted  an  ‘‘Unsolicited 
Proposal.’’ 

Senator  VITTER.  OK,  that  was  rejected.  What  was  the  analysis 
that led to rejecting that? What is being done instead of that? How 
would you compare, at least in hindsight, the two in terms of cost- 
benefit? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  Again,  if  I  could  go  back  and  provide  them  for 
the  record,  the  only  reason  I  can’t  tell  you  right  now,  is  I  wasn’t 
involved  in  that  final  decision.  I  know  that  there  was  a  proposal 
floating around, I don’t know how it was officially presented to the 
Coast Guard, what analysis was done, but I’m more than happy to 
provide that for the record, Senator. 

Senator  VITTER.  OK,  now  moving  forward  in  terms  of  the  FRCs, 
why  are  we  as  focused  as  we  seem  to  be  on  composite  technology, 
which  isn’t  fully  developed,  and  isn’t  that  focus  inconsistent  with 
some  of  the  premises  of  the  Deepwater  Program,  pull  things,  de-
velop, off the shelf in a pretty efficient way? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  Well,  I  think  there  was  always  a  premium 
placed  on  innovation  when  the  contract  was  awarded,  and  we’re 
certainly expecting that out of the integrators. 

I  think,  as  the  Inspector  General  and  the  Government  Account-
ability  Office  have  said,  the  business  case  up-front  and  the  feasi-
bility and the risk-assessment on the construction of the composite 
hull  probably  should  have  been  done  sooner  than  it  has  been.  We 
have done that now. 

The  points  have  been  raised  by  the  Inspector  General  which  are 
well-taken,  regarding  the  third-party  analysis,  business  case  anal-
ysis, are all part of our business practices at this time. 

In  regards  to  the  FRC  composite  hull  design,  we  did  that  after 
we had a design presented to us, at that point, our engineers raised 
concerns, we were going to do a risk mitigation strategy, and that’s 
where  we’re  at  now.  We  actually  did  the  right  thing,  late.  But  we 
are doing that now, and we want to move forward until we’re sure 
that we’ve reduced the risk, that it’s feasible for us to continue. In 
the  meantime,  we  will  continue  to  pursue  a  parent-craft  design, 
and fill our patrol boat gap with that, sir. 

Senator VITTER. What’s the timetable for that analysis, the risk- 

mitigation analysis that you’re talking about? 

Admiral ALLEN. We’re receiving all of the information right now, 

I would say it’s a matter of weeks, not months.

Senator  VITTER.  OK.  As  I  understand  it,  when  you  compare  the 
traditional steel hull to a composite hull, the argument for the com-
posite is much longer life duration. 

Admiral ALLEN. Yes, sir. 
Senator  VITTER.  One  of  the  big  arguments  for  the  steel  is,  much 
lower  cost.  When  you  compare  the  two,  the  composite  costs  many 
times  more,  even  factoring  in  longer  life.  Is  that  accurate,  and  is 
that part of the analysis you’re doing? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  Yes,  sir.  Not  being  a  Naval  engineer,  that’s  my 
understanding, too. And that’s—the business case analysis, and the 
feasibility  of  the  construction,  that’s  what  we  have  to  look  at  right 
now, and we have to come to a conclusion on the proper way to go 
with the composite hull, sir. 

Senator VITTER. OK. 
Mr. Skinner, were you aware as it was happening, or later, with 
this  proposed  solution  that  came  out  of  Bollinger  shipyards  in 
terms of the 110′ to 123′ conversion? 

Mr.  SKINNER.  With—I’m  not  sure  I  understand  your  question, 
Senator.  Like  I  say,  we  were  not  reviewing  the  conversion  project 
in itself. 

Senator VITTER. OK. 
Mr.  SKINNER.  We  did  react  to,  we  did  receive  allegations  that 
during  that  conversion,  certain  equipment  was  being  installed  on 
the cutters, as well as the small boats, the precursors, that did not 
meet  contract  specs.  In  reaction  to  those  allegations—there  were 
four  of  them  actually—we  did  a  review  to  determine  whether  the 
contractor was, in fact, meeting his obligations. 

Senator VITTER. OK. Your work on that project, as I understand 

it, then, didn’t have to do with the hulls or the structures. 

Mr. SKINNER. That’s correct. 
Senator VITTER. It had to do with other parts of the project. 
Mr. SKINNER. That’s correct. 
Senator VITTER. OK, fair enough. 
Final question, very quickly, for Mr. Caldwell—what role did the 
lack  of  appropriations  play  in  the  performance  of  the  program,  in 
your opinion? 

Mr.  CALDWELL.  I  don’t  think  we’ve  seen  problems  due  to  a  lack 
of appropriations. There were a couple of cases, such as the VUAV, 
where  there  has  been  a  combination  of  funding  and  technology 
issues. In the case of the VUAV, some officials in the Coast Guard 
told  us  that  funding  issues  had  prevented  them  from  going  for-
ward.  However,  there  were  mitigating  issues  such  as  concern  that 
the technology was not mature enough, so I’m not sure they would 
have wanted to go forward, even if the funding was available. 

Senator VITTER. OK. 
Thank you, Madam Chair. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Senator Kerry? 
Senator KERRY. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
Admiral, referring back to the memorandum which Senator Lau-
tenberg  mentioned  from  Admiral  Brown  to  Admiral  Stillman.  The 
date on that is March 29, 2004. The title of it is ‘‘National Security 
Cutter  Structural  Design  Deficiencies.’’  Paragraph  1A  refers  to  re-
duction gear structure, major structural design problems, improper 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

53 

rocking,  deflection  of  thrust-bearing,  foundation,  and  stiffness. 
Paragraph  B  was  superstructure  buckling,  inadequate  primary, 
secondary  and  tertiary  structural  stress  analysis.  Also,  super-
structure  reentry  and  design  issues,  discontinuity  in  the  super-
structure  amid  ships  leading  to  early  fatigue  failure,  and  super-
structure  cracking.  Paragraph  C,  sheer  strake  deck  penetrations. 
There  were  strength  deck  stringer  plates,  oval  openings  in  the 
strength  deck,  which  are  prohibited  by  another  specific  reference 
there  in  the  reduction  gear  structure,  and  two,  hole  control.  Inap-
propriate  placement  of  openings  in  the  longitudinal  structural 
bulkheads. 

These  are  all  pretty  significant,  or  certainly  not  insignificant 
structural  design  flaws.  They  resulted  in  some  $500  million,  I  be-
lieve, of fix. That’s March 29, 2004. 

And here, in paragraph two, a very important sentence. ‘‘Admiral 
Brown, my concern is that I—over the past 18 months, my subject 
matter  experts  have  attempted  to  work,  collaboratively,  within  the 
IPT  structure  to  resolve  these  problems,  through  review,  comment 
and  follow-on  discussion  of  the  structural  design.  My  concern  is 
that  ICGS  has  unilaterally  closed  the  structural  comments  and 
concerns  and  ended  any  collaborative  effort  at  the  NSC,  IPT  and 
sub-IPT  level,  without  reaching  resolution.’’  So,  they  just  shut  it 
down. 

Now,  here’s  what  I  don’t  understand.  In  2004,  there  are  these 
major structural issues. Yet, in May 2006, the Coast Guard decided 
to  extend  the  contract  with  Lockheed/Northrop  for  43  months, 
starting  in  June  2007,  without  resolution,  and  given  what  it  knew 
had happened. 

In your written testimony, you state, ‘‘The Coast Guard has been, 
and  remains,  fully  involved  in  the  management  of  this  program, 
and  has  made  all  final  and  critical  decisions.’’  I  contrast  that  to 
what  Mr.  Skinner  says,  which  is,  ‘‘The  Deepwater  contract  essen-
tially empowered the contractor with authority for decisionmaking. 
Therefore,  the  Coast  Guard  was  reluctant  to  exercise  a  sufficient 
degree  of  authority,  to  influence  the  design  production  of  its  own 
assets.’’ 

Now, I don’t think we can have it both ways. We need to under-
stand, which is what, number one, and number two, why would the 
Coast  Guard—given  that  unbelievable,  unilateral  obstinence  to 
working with you—why would you renew the contract? 

Admiral ALLEN. Yes sir, if I could separate it into two issues. 
Senator KERRY. It is two issues, right. 
Admiral  ALLEN.  The  NCS  fatigue  issue,  and  then  the  award 

term. 

I’ve  got  a  diagram  here  of  the  major  areas  of  the  ship  that  were 
impacted  that  were  raised  in  Admiral  Brown’s  memo.  These  were 
also confirmed by Carderock, in fatigue finite element analysis, and 
these are the bases for our discussions at ICGS right now. 

I  will  tell  you,  and  I’m  happy  to  answer,  for  the  record,  to  give 
you a complete status on every one of the issues that was listed in 
Admiral  Brown’s  memo.  A  couple  of  those  were  taken  care  of  with 
ICGS,  including  the  most  important  one,  in  my  view,  which  were 
the issues related to the reduction gear, how the engines would sit,

and how much room there would be to adjust those for shaft align-
ment. 

[The information referred to follows:] 

Issues From G–S Memo to G–D, dated 29 Mar 2004 
(a) Reduction Gear Structure 

(1)  Structural  Design  of  Ship  Bottom:  Improper  rocking  deflection  or  thrust  bear-

ing foundation stiffness. 

Response:  NGSS  deepened  the  girders  below  the  reduction  gears.  NSWC- 
Carderock  performed  an  analysis  which  showed  the  rocking  deflection  to  be  within 
Renk tolerances. 
(b) Superstructure Buckling 

(1)  Superstructure  Buckling:  Inadequate  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  struc-

Response:  NGSS  increased  the  superstructure  plating  between  the  01  level  and 

tural stress analysis. 

the 02 level. 

(2)  Superstructure  Re-Entrant  Design:  Abrupt  discontinuity  in  the  superstructure 

amidships leading to early fatigue failure and superstructure cracking. 

Response:  NSWC-Carderock  and  D&P  Fatigue  Analyses  identified  areas  of  high 
stress  concentrations.  The  Tiger  Team  structural  modifications  will  address  these 
concerns  on  NSC  3–8.  Fixes  for  NSC  1  and  2  are  under  development  and  will  be 
planned for installation during the cutters’ first Dry Dock Availability. 
(c) Sheer Strake Deck Penetrations 

(1)  Strength  Deck  Stringer  Plates:  Large  elongated  oval  openings  in  the  strength 

deck stringer plates which are prohibited by reference (a). 

Response:  Tiger  Team  structural  modifications  will  fix  large  holes  in  strength 
deck stringer plate on NSC 3–8. Fixes for NSC 1 and 2 are under development and 
will be planned for installation during the cutters’ first Dry Dock Availability. 

(2)  Hole  Control:  Inappropriate  placement  of  openings  in  the  longitudinal  struc-

tural bulkheads prohibited by reference (a). 

Response:  Some  progress  has  been  made  in  hole  control  for  longitudinal  bulk-
heads. NSWC-Carderock and D&P fatigue analyses identified remaining stress con-
centrations  and  Tiger  Team  structural  modifications  will  fix  them  on  NSC  3–8. 
Fixes  for  NSC  1  and  2  are  under  development  and  will  be  planned  for  installation 
during the cutters’ first Dry Dock Availability. 
Issues From G–SDW Memo to G–DPM–4, dated 04 Jan 2005 

(a)  Strength  Deck  Stringer  Plates:  The  vent  penetration  openings  in  the  01  level 
stringer strake remain the most serious concern with the WMSL (NSC) design. The 
inadequate  fatigue  strength  will  result  in  cracks  which  could  propagate  and  cause 
the  hull  girder  to  fail.  This  problem  is  worsened  with  the  penetrations  required  for 
the helicopter ASIST system which will be located slightly inboard the vent penetra-
tions. 

Response:  Tiger  Team  structural  modifications  will  fix  large  holes  in  strength 
deck stringer plates on NSC 3–8. Fixes for NSC 1 and 2 are under development and 
will be planned for installation during the cutters’ first Dry Dock Availability. 

(b) Superstructure Re-Entrant Design: ICGS has not provided a valid fatigue anal-
ysis of the superstructure re-entrant design. There is a significant risk of cracks de-
veloping  in  the  superstructure  that  could  propagate  into  the  strength  deck.  In  a 
worst case scenario, these cracks could lead to hull girder failure similar to that de-
scribed above. 

Response: The Tiger Team structural modifications will address this issue on NSC 
3–8. Fixes for NSC 1 and 2 are under development and will be planned for installa-
tion during the cutters’ first Dry Dock Availability. 

(c) Shell Fashion Plates: The ICGS fatigue analysis demonstrates that the fatigue 
characteristics  of  the  shell  fashion  plates  are  marginal  even  with  the  incorrect  as-
sumptions described in paragraph 2. Also, the fatigue analysis did not consider sec-
ondary  loads  or  that  fact  that  the  fashion  plates  above  the  deck  are  not  stiffened. 
It  is  our  assessment  that  the  fatigue  characteristics  of  the  current  fashion  plates 
are inadequate and that any cracks that arise could propagate and lead to hull gird-
er failure.

Response: Tiger Team modifications will address this issue on NSC 3–8. Fixes for 
NSC 1 and 2 are under development and will be planned for installation during the 
cutters’ first Dry Dock Availability. 

(d) Hangar Racking Strength: In analyzing the hangar racking strength, ICGS in-
correctly  assumed  zero  rotation  at  the  frame  ends,  which  resulted  in  selecting  a 
smaller  frame  size  than  what  is  actually  required.  Also,  there  is  large  opening  in 
the  aft  hangar  sloping  bulkhead  for  helo  control  station  which  was  not  reflected  in 
the  analysis.  Additionally,  dead  loads  were  not  considered  in  the  analysis,  which  is 
standard practice. By not properly addressing these deficiencies, cracks in the hang-
ar  structure  will  develop  and  require  continual  repair  and  eventual  replacement  of 
structural members. 

Response:  NSWC-Carderock  analysis  of  the  helicopter  hangar  indicates  that  the 

existing structural arrangement is adequate to withstand the expected loads. 

(e) Hole Control: Progress has been made by relocating some holes in the longitu-
dinal  bulkheads,  however  several  access  openings  remain  in  key  areas  where  the 
shear  and  bending  stresses  will  be  greatest.  ICGS  has  not  provided  a  shear  flow 
analysis to demonstrate that the loads in the longitudinal bulkheads generated from 
hull bending or dry-docking can be safely transferred into transverse bulkheads 44, 
64, and 70. There is a significant possibility that the longitudinal bulkheads will fail 
where  they  intersect  the  transverse  bulkheads  because  of  a  significant  reduction  in 
shear area in the longitudinal bulkheads due to the inappropriate location of many 
doors. 

Response: NSWC-Carderock and D&P fatigue analysis validated the remainder of 
this  concern.  Tiger  Team  modifications  will  address  this  issue  on  NSC  3–8.  Fixes 
for NSC 1 and 2 are under development and will be planned for installation during 
the cutters’ first Dry Dock Availability. 

(f)  01  Knuckle:  Concern  remains  that  the  01  level  structure  near  the  knuckle  at 
Frame 27 has not been properly designed for the resultant eccentric loading and fa-
tigue. A U.S. Navy DDG 51 class ship with a similar knuckle in the 01 level experi-
enced deck buckling, which required a very expensive back fit. 

Response:  NSWC-Carderock  and  D&P  fatigue  analysis  validated  this  concern. 
Tiger  Team  modifications  will  address  this  issue  on  NSC  3–8.  Fixes  for  NSC  1  and 
2  are  under  development  and  will  be  planned  for  installation  during  the  cutters’ 
first Dry Dock Availability. 

(g) Reduction Gear Structure: In their analysis of the structure supporting the re-
duction  gears,  ICGS  improperly  modeled  the  stanchions  as  infinitely  rigid,  and  the 
vibration results from this analysis are very close to the tolerances for the reduction 
gear.  If  the  deflection  of  the  inner-bottom  is  greater  than  what  is  allowed  by  the 
reduction gear manufacturer, this will clearly be a warranty issue. 

Response:  NSWC-Carderock  performed  an  analysis  which  showed  the  rocking  de-

flection to be within Renk tolerances. 

What  I’d  like  to  do  is  provide  you  with  a  line-item  list  of  which 
ones  have  been  carried  over  for  negotiations  for  hulls  1  and  2, 
which  ones  were  reconciled  at  the  time.  This,  basically,  is  a  pic-
torial of the major issues. The issues down below in the hull where 
the  reduction  gear  were  at,  and  then  openings  in  the  hull  that 
would facilitate cracking, should the vibrations cause that—— 

Senator  KERRY.  I  understand  that.  I  understand  the  issues,  and 
I understand that some of them have been partially resolved, to the 
tune of very significant amounts of money. The issue here is a pro-
cedural one. 

Admiral ALLEN. Yes, sir. 
Senator  KERRY.  Why  would  the  Coast  Guard  renew  the  contract 

given such an explicit statement of discontent with the process? 

Admiral ALLEN. Yes, sir. 
When the contract was awarded in June 2002, the criteria for the 
next  award  term  was  established.  You  know,  in  my  view,  there 
wasn’t  enough  specificity  and  clarity  in  the  contract  that  would 
allow  you  to  differentiate  when  this  problem  occurred,  because  it 
was focused on operational effectiveness of the system, total owner-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

56 

ship  cost,  and  customer  satisfaction,  and  the  evaluation  for  the 
next award term was contractually bound by those parameters. 

Senator KERRY. But, you didn’t have to renew the contract. 
Admiral ALLEN. This, we haven’t renewed the contract—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Let  me  go—I  mean,  paragraph  three  here,  I 
didn’t even read the whole memo, but paragraph three talks about 
the  two  experts  that  he  saw  fit  to  bring  to  the  table,  and  he  says, 
I mean, this is Admiral Brown asking for Admiral Stillman to help 
resolve the issue. He says, ‘‘I’m seeking your immediate support in 
finding  a  mutually  agreeable  method  for  resolving  these  engineer-
ing  differences.’’  He  brings  two  experts  to  the  table,  a  Mr.  Silksy, 
and  a  Mr.  Robert  Scott,  both  very  experienced  ship  designers,  et 
cetera. 

And  provides  the  enclosures  of  their  analyses.  And  those  enclo-
sures,  quote—I’m  quoting  from  the  memo,  ‘‘These  enclosures  cor-
roborate the findings of my technical experts, and confirm through 
independent  analyses  that  significant  flaws  exist  in  the  structural 
design  of  the  NSC.’’  Now,  if  significant  flaws  exist  in  the  design, 
and  they  have  shut  you  out  in  any  collaborative  effort  without 
reaching a resolution, why would you renew a contract? 

Admiral  ALLEN.  First  of  all,  sir,  the  contract  has  not  been  re-
newed.  What  the  award  term  decision  was,  it  created  the  oppor-
tunity  in  June  of  this  year,  to  award  a  contract  for  43  months,  in 
terms of that contract, currently under discussion with the contrac-
tors. So, we have not renewed the contracts. 

Senator KERRY. So, if that is true, that you haven’t renewed it— 
in  The  New  York  Times,  one  of  your  engineers,  an  Anthony 
D’Armiento was quoted as saying, ‘‘This is the fleecing of America. 
It is the worst contract arrangement I’ve seen in my 20-plus years 
of Naval engineering.’’ 

Why  would  you  not,  sort  of  heeding  the  sequence  of  analysis  of 
both GAO and the Inspector General put this out to bid? And that’s 
without  prejudice,  if  Northrop  and  Lockheed  want  to  come  back 
and  say,  ‘‘We  can  do  this  better,  and  here’s  how  we’ll  do  it,’’  they 
have a right to do it. 

But  wouldn’t  we,  the  taxpayer,  wouldn’t  the  folks  we  represent, 
and  the  interests  of  national  security  in  getting  this  done,  you 
know,  the  right  way  at  the  right  cost,  competitively  bid,  at  this 
point—wouldn’t we all be better off? 

Admiral ALLEN. Well, sir, that’s the work that is around us right 
now. When I came into the job, one of the tasks we had was to ne-
gotiate the terms of the new contract, should it be awarded in June 
for  43  months?  I  have  both,  I  have  had  meetings  with  both  the 
CEOs  of  Lockheed  Martin,  and  Northrop  Grumman,  we  have  a 
work  group  working  right  now  on  the  potential  structure  of  that 
contract,  should  it  be  awarded,  we  are  at  that  decision  point,  and 
we are working the problem as we speak right now. And I’m happy 
to come back and discuss it with the Committee when we, our work 
group is done. 

Senator KERRY. Well, fair enough. But, I think it’s awfully impor-
tant—I  see  my  time  has  gone  over,  I  apologize—awfully  important 
to  really  stay  in  touch  with  us  on  this,  and  see  if  we  can’t  work 
on  it.  I’m  not  trying  to,  you  know,  I  just  think  the  accountability 
issue is really pretty critical.

Madam  Chairwoman,  I  don’t  have  time  now  because  of  the  time 
thing, but I wanted to ask some questions of both Mr. Skinner and 
Mr.  Caldwell  with  respect  to  whether  the  structure,  the  contract 
structure  itself,  isn’t  fundamentally  flawed.  And,  it  seems  to  me  if 
you  read  fairly  explicitly,  and  I  don’t  think  you  have  to  read  be-
tween  the  lines,  to  see  that  there’s  a  power  allocation  here  that’s 
just out of whack, in terms of who gets the accountability and how. 

And so, I think we ought to explore that. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I  thank  the  Senator  for  that  line  of 
questioning, and to point out that we will keep the record open, we 
are  going  to  move  to  the  next  panel  because  we  are  going  to  have 
a vote later this afternoon. 

So,  I  appreciate  each  of  you  and  your  testimony.  We  will  leave 
the  record  open  for  questions,  if  you  could  comply  in  getting  those 
answers to us in the next 2 weeks, we would appreciate it. 

But again, Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Skinner, Admiral Allen, thank you 

for being here. 

And,  I’d  like  to  call  up  the  second  panel.  Dr.  Leo  Mackay,  Vice 
President  and  General  Manager,  Coast  Guard  Systems,  Lockheed 
Martin,  Maritime  Systems  and  Sensors;  Mr.  Philip  A.  Teel,  Presi-
dent of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, and Captain Kevin Jar-
vis,  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  retired.  If  you  gentlemen  could  come  up  to 
the table, I would appreciate that. 

And  if  those  who  would  like  to  leave  the  hearing  would  do  so 

quickly, so that we can start this second panel. 

And, Captain Jarvis, I think we’ll start with you. 
Go  ahead,  Captain  Jarvis.  Thank  you  for  being  here,  I  know 
you’ve  traveled  a  long  way  to  be  here  at  this  hearing,  so  I  appre-
ciate it. 

STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN KEVIN P. JARVIS, 

U.S. COAST GUARD, RETIRED 

Captain  JARVIS.  Good  afternoon.  Chairperson  Cantwell,  Ranking 
Member  Snowe,  and  other  distinguished  members  of  the  Sub-
committee,  thank  you  for  holding  this  important  hearing  con-
cerning the subject that has consumed a good portion of my life for 
the last 7 years. 

I  am  Kevin  Jarvis,  a  retired—a  recent  retiree—from  the  United 
States Coast Guard, the military organization that I have loved for 
over 29 years of commissioned service, and proudly wear my retire-
ment pin for all to see. 

Because  of  my  continued,  unmatched  loyalty  and  love  for  this 
magnificent organization, this specific topic, and the unique famili-
arity I have with many of the Deepwater tactical and strategic de-
cisions,  policies  and  results  and  outcomes,  I’ve  elected  to  come  to 
testify today after a long train ride from Florida. 

In  providing  this  testimony,  it  is  my  solitary  hope  that  I  can  as-
sist  you,  and  the  Coast  Guard,  to  make  this  very  important  and 
critically needed asset acquisition program more effective, cost-effi-
cient and transparent, and most importantly—as the good stewards 
we’re supposed to be—more accountable to the American public. 

I  spent  a  predominance  of  my  service  in  Naval  engineering  and 
logistics-related  assignments.  From  the  deck  plates  and  bilges  in 
three different cutters, selection as the DOT/U.S. Coast Guard 1993

58 

Federal  Engineer  of  the  Year,  an  assignment  as  the  Commanding 
Officer of the Coast Guard’s Engineering Logistics Center, I’ve seen 
and/or  done  virtually  everything  in  naval  engineering  the  Coast 
Guard could do. 

I’ve  acquired  four  Master’s  Degrees—two  from  the  University  of 
Michigan  in  Naval  Engineering  and  Marine  Architecture,  and  also 
Mechanical  Engineering.  I  was  introduced  as  the  G–S  Representa-
tive to the Deepwater program in November 2000. 

The  following  are  my  overviews  of  both  my  direct  observations 
and  experiences  while  engaging  on  G–S  behalf  for  21⁄2 years,  at 
both the strategic heights, and the tactical trenches with the Deep-
water program. 

G–S  supported  the  Deepwater  program,  and  embodied  virtually 
all  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  engineering  and  logistics  expertise.  I  was 
there as the G–S organization, a proven Coast Guard major acqui-
sition,  engineering  and  logistic  enabler,  was  shut  out  of  its  tradi-
tional  acquisition-specified  technical  roles.  I  was  there  when  the 
Deepwater culture was cemented with thick walls of change agent, 
‘‘Our  ends  will  justify  the  means,  we  have  the  world’s  best  Navy 
engineers  for  advice,  only  contractor  insight  is  needed,  not  over-
sight. And the contractor’s engineer’s work is good enough.’’ 

Consequently,  1,000  years  of  Coast  Guard  naval  engineering 
technical  capabilities  were  wasted  by  the  poor  strategic  judgment 
of the program’s original crafters, and the unwillingness of the sub-
sequent program leaders to make the needed deviations. 

As  a  result,  the  tactical  trenches  of  the  program—the  integrated 
process  teams—became  cauldrons  of  mistrust  for  communication, 
G–D-managed,  unilateral  decisions  against  G–S  technical  warn-
ings,  and  the  ruthless  execution  of  the  published  schedule  at  vir-
tually all costs. 
I  was  there  watching  an  impending  train  wreck,  as  the  110′  to 
123′ conversion progressed at full-speed in the face of numerous G– 
S-vocal and written, formal engineering objections. 

The too-close linkage, and over-reliance by the G–D staff, on the 
industry partner’s ‘‘good enough’’ engineering work and assessment 
supported  a  multitude  of  poor,  time-based  decisions.  The  prima 
facie results speak volumes—8 non-operational cutters. 

The NSC followed the same path. By continually dismissing GS’s 
engineering concerns, which were documented well before the 2004 
Admiral  Brown  memo,  we  missed  the  perfect  opportunity  to  make 
the  needed  structural  changes  prior  to  any  issuance  of  the  NSC, 
while  the  NSC  was  supposedly  still  on  the  electronic  drawing 
board. 

Instead, we wasted years sending memos back and forth with no 
real resolution progress in sight. We now have NSC 1 floating, and 
NSC  2  well  along  in  the  construction,  with  potentially  thousands, 
if  not  millions,  of  dollars  needed  for  future  corrective  actions.  This 
didn’t need to happen. 

At least the FRC has proven to be a partial success, and not be-
cause  of  any  production  issue.  Because  the  FRC  concept  matured 
after  the  123′  and  NSC  engineering  problems,  the  G–S  voice  be-
came  too  important  to  ignore,  when  they  identified  serious  design 
concerns with yet, another, ICGS poorly integrated effort.

Thankfully,  the  FRC  was  halted  before,  what  would  have  been, 
a  third  surface  mistake  being  constructed.  We  just  don’t  have 
enough money to make these types of design errors. 

This  oral  testimony  is  primarily  focused  on  the  extremely 
unhealthy relationship within the program, and the resultant engi-
neering  issues  that  spawned  from  them.  But,  what’s  just  as  trou-
bling  is  the  absence  of  a  viable,  or  producible  asset,  or  systems  of 
systems  logistics  plan,  after  nearly  5  years  of  critical  program  and 
tax dollars being applied. 

Similar to the engineering problems, the Deepwater Program has 
failed  to  hold  the  contractor  accountable,  and  the  systems  inte-
grator  has  failed  to  take  the  needed  assertive  and  corrective  role 
to produce this significant contract deliverable. Although the Coast 
Guard  has  a  good  deal  of  blame  to  accept  in  this  regard,  the  inte-
grator  is  also  very  complicit.  They  just  didn’t  act  in  the  expected 
capacity as required by the Deepwater contract. 

I have a great deal of respect for Admiral Allen’s overt leadership 
and  direction  to  clean  up  this  mess,  but  I  must  raise  the  caution 
flag—this program, this was a program that believes a deviation to 
every situation is possible. The very old G–S/G–D roles and respon-
sibilities  memo  was  signed,  forwarded,  reviewed  and  approved  by 
four Flag Officers with the combined weight of 10 stars. Yet, it was 
completely ignored by the Deepwater Program. 

I’ve had extremely limited knowledge of what has happened with 
the  Deepwater  Program  since  I  left  the  service  last  spring.  I’d  like 
to  use  this  fact  as  a  qualifier  that  some  of  my  following  improve-
ment  recommendations  for  your  consideration  might  already  have 
taken place. 

I  have  read  the  DHS  IG  report,  and  Admiral  Allen’s  testimony 
on  the  subject,  and  I  wholeheartedly  agree  with  the  IG’s  finding 
and  the  Admiral’s  initial  corrective  steps  to  fix  this,  the  multitude 
of Deepwater problems. 

Of  the  Admiral’s  actions,  the  formal  delineation  of  technical  au-
thority  to  G–S  will  have  the  most  immediate,  positive  returns.  Al-
though an excellent start to organization correction, there are other 
things that I think need to be instituted. 

Oversight of the contractor must happen. We’re fooling ourselves 
if  we  actually  believe  insight  is  enough.  Greater  accountability  is 
needed of how the program decisions were made, and what was the 
basis  for  those  decisions.  Real  risk-based  decisions  with  an  active 
and  managed  database  needs  to  be  part  of  the  program’s  normal 
assessments of both short- and long-term risk exposures. 

Accurate, verifiable, and repeatable metrics need to be developed 
and  utilized.  The  continuation  of  the  systems  integrator  should 
cease.  The  current  contract  should  be  modified  or  restructured  to 
enable  the  Coast  Guard  to  work  directly  with  asset  manufacturers 
for construction. Asset support and logistics and supply chain man-
agement should be managed by Coast Guard organic resources. In-
corporate the existing G–S-Cutter Certification Matrix on all future 
surface  asset  procurements.  IPT  leadership  and  shares  should  not 
be  held  by  the  same  entities  we’re  trying  to  govern  and  manage. 
It just can’t work. 

In  closing,  I  greatly  appreciate  the  opportunity  this  committee 
has  offered  me  today  to  testify  before  you.  Concurrent  with  this

oral  testimony,  I’ve  provided  a  very  lengthy,  and  detailed,  written 
testimony  for  inclusion  in  the  record.  It  further  amplifies  many  of 
my  oral  comments  concerning  the  variety  of  Deepwater  subjects 
that have brought me here today. 

I’m more than happy, and very willing, to answer any and all of 

your questions to the best of my ability.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN KEVIN P. JARVIS, U.S. COAST GUARD, RETIRED 

Introduction 

Good  afternoon.  Senator  Cantwell,  as  the  Chair  of  this  subcommittee,  I’d  like  to 
thank you and the remainder of the Committee members for holding this important 
hearing  concerning  a  subject  that  has  consumed  a  good  portion  of  my  life  for  the 
last 7 years. I’d also like to start off by thanking Senator Snowe whose name I rec-
ognize  as  both  the  Ranking  Member  of  this  subcommittee  but  also  as  a  supporter 
of the Coast Guard and a desired Deepwater acceleration. 

I am Kevin Jarvis a recent retiree from the United States Coast Guard, the mili-
tary  organization  I  have  loved  for  over  29  years  of  commissioned  service.  I  proudly 
wear  my  retirement  pin  for  all  to  see.  Because  of  my  continued  unmatched  loyalty 
and  love  for  this  magnificent  organization  and  the  service  it  provides  the  United 
States, this specific topic (Deepwater) and the unfortunate negative publicity it has 
cast  undeservedly  on  many  of  the  men  and  women  of  Coast  Guard,  and  my  unique 
familiarity with many of the Deepwater tactical and strategic decisions, policies and 
resultant  outcomes,  I  elected  to  come  and  testify  today  after  a  long  train  ride  from 
Florida.  In  providing  this  testimony,  it  is  my  solitary  hope  that  it  can  assist  you 
and the Coast Guard to make this very important and critically-needed asset acqui-
sition program more effective, cost efficient and transparent, and most importantly, 
as  the  good  stewards  we’re  supposed  to  be,  more  accountable  to  the  American  pub-
lic. 

A short synopsis of my background is as follows: I am a career Coast Guard com-
missioned officer who has spent a predominance of my service in Naval Engineering 
and logistic related assignments. From the deck plates and bilges in three different 
cutters,  my  selection  as  the  DOT–U.S.  Coast  Guard  1993  Federal  Engineer  of  the 
Year, to my final assignment as the Commanding Officer of the Coast Guard’s Engi-
neering  Logistic  Center  (ELC),  I’ve  seen,  and/or  done  virtually  everything  a  Naval 
Engineer could do. In addition to my Coast Guard Academy education (BSE in Elec-
trical Engineering), I’ve been fortunate enough acquire two Master Degrees from the 
University of Michigan in the areas of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, 
and  Mechanical  Engineering.  Moreover,  I  acquired  a  Master  of  Arts  degree  in  Na-
tional Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College; as a Naval Engi-
neer, attending the Naval War College is a relative rarity. Last, I completed, in con-
currence with my last Commanding Officer assignment, a Master of Science degree 
in Quality Systems Management with an emphasis in Six Sigma from the National 
Graduate  School.  It  was  a  result  of  many  of  these  engineering  experiences,  edu-
cational qualifications, proven leadership attributes and lucky timing that was I in-
troduced as a G–S representative to the Deepwater program. 

Prior  to  any  detailed  discussion  I  have  on  the  Deepwater  program,  let  me  state 
that I have read the recent DHS IG report dated January 2007 and agree with their 
findings  and  recommendations.  Additionally,  I’ve  been  provided  a  copy  of  the  Com-
mandant’s  recent  Congressional  testimony  on  this  subject  and  I  fully  believe  Admi-
ral  Allen’s  legitimate  emphasis  and  desire  for  program  transparency,  greater  ac-
countability  and  formally  shifting  technical  authority  from  the  contractor  or  ele-
ments of the acquisition directorate to the more rightful owner, the engineers within 
the CG–4 directorate are excellent steps in the right direction. 
The Deepwater Contract Strategy and Its Flaws 

The contract strategy was in reality pretty simple and elegant to describe, but due 
to its uniqueness, getting any type of details beyond the ‘‘concept’’ was virtually im-
possible  to  acquire.  This  System-of-Systems,  performance-based  contract  was  to 
have as its major hallmarks; a ‘‘Systems’’ integrator to ensure all the working parts 
of the delivered assets worked together; a performance-based contract that, with the 
exception of the National Security Cutter (NSC) which was relatively detailed in the 
Systems  Performance  Specification  (SPS)  Section  3.8,  was  all  about  the  final  per-
formance  of  the  ‘‘built  out  system’’;  a  heavy  reliance  on  Commercial  Off-The-Shelf 
(COTS)  and  Commercial  and  Non-Developmental  Items  (CANDI);  and  an  assort-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

61 

ment  of  virtually  every  Contract  Line  Item  (CLIN)  billing  strategy  imaginable.  The 
Contractor’s  performance  would  supposedly  be  monitored  and  assessed  through  the 
System’s  increased  Operational  Effectiveness  (OpEff),  lower  Total  Ownership  Costs 
(TOC),  and  Customer  Satisfaction.  The  strategy  was  indeed  unique.  Building  the 
contract  details,  simultaneously  moving  down  a  very  aggressive  Request  for  Pro-
posal  (RFP)  timeline  concurrent  with  three  separate  industry  teams  desiring  con-
tract  related  guidance,  and  building  the  program  and  directorate  support  staffs  all 
at the same time would prove to be an almost imaginable task. This constant dance 
between  pre-set  time-driven  requirements  and  necessary  performance  specifics 
would only get worse as the contract matured. 

Moreover, it was readily apparent to many prior to award with the three industry 
teams and immediately after award to ICGS that the implementation of this simple 
and  elegant  strategy  would  be  extremely  complex  to  manage  properly  and  virtually 
impossible  to  hold  the  contractor’s  feet  to  many  of  the  performance  measures  since 
it  was  all  built  on  the  ‘‘end-state’’  system-of-systems  performance;  ergo  we’d  have 
to  really  wait  until  2020  or  so  to  really  see  if  we  ultimately  got  what  we  paid  for. 
The  contractor  could  easily  state  that  a  missed  mark  in  articulated  performance 
with  an  early  delivery  asset  would  be  accounted  for  in  a  later  version  of  another 
asset,  or  some  other  part  of  the  still  undeveloped  part  of  the  system-of-systems 
planned  concept.  This  became  a  constant  moving  target  when  trying  to  pin  down 
any  given  system’s  performance  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Making  matters  worse 
was  the  fact  that  the  Coast  Guard  couldn’t  develop  an  accurate  and  repeatable 
OpEff  model  in  time  for  the  various  industry  teams  to  insert  their  System  of  Sys-
tems numbers and justify ‘‘real’’ OpEff increases from their contract proposal. Even-
tually, with the established RFP solicitation date fast approaching the Coast Guard 
and  industry  teams  settled  on  a  ‘‘Presence  Model’’  that  evaluated  the  industry 
team’s  proposal  based  on  asset  presence  and  coverage  capabilities  of  locations  and 
missions  only;  lost  was  the  assessment  of  an  integrated  solution  where  the  sum 
would exceed the individual parts! 

To make matter worse was the accepted realization that any induced Coast Guard 
changes in mission requirements, workforce management, maintenance needs, fund-
ing issues or virtually anything that could impact the ‘‘System of Systems’’ perform-
ance,  could  be  the  trigger  for  any  of  the  contractors  to  ask  for,  and  probably  be 
awarded, a contract modification for either more money, more time, or readjustment 
of  the  already  difficult  to  mandate  operational  effectiveness  baseline.  Here  was  an-
other  flaw  in  the  contract  strategy.  To  try  and  hold  the  contractor  accountable  for 
any  Coast  Guard  induced  change,  adjustments  to  the  OpEff  model  and  measure-
ments  against  an  established  and  agreed  upon  baseline  would  be  needed.  This  was 
a  very  transparent  problem  that  was  immediately  highlighted  after  the  needed 
Coast Guard mission changes from 9/11. 

As mentioned previously, only the NSC had any level of real defined and measur-
able  asset  performance  requirements.  The  remainders  of  the  system-of-systems 
deliverables  were  virtually  non-defined  and  were  left  to  the  individual  industry 
teams  to  be  innovative  and  propose  an  integrated  solution  for  a  20+  year  perform-
ance period. This enabled each industry team to propose an assortment of near-term 
and out-year ideas with costs estimates which were difficult to defend but even more 
difficult for the Coast Guard to analyze as rational and reasonable. As a result, cost 
proposal,  TOC  numbers  and  the  process  for  fitting  them  into  the  annual  cost  con-
straints  imposed  by  the  Coast  Guard  as  an  acceptable  bid  was  a  skill  mastered  by 
the  winning  industry  team,  yet  appeared  to  be  elusive  for  justification  and  repeat-
ability. 

COTS  and  CANDI  equipments  are  great  catch  words  and  were  to  be  the  basis  of 
matching  innovation’s  potential  higher  costs  with  already  proven,  mature  designs 
and equipment with supportable and manageable supply chains. With a reliance on 
COTS/CANDI, the contract strategy often associated itself with the minimization of 
Acquisition,  Construction  and  Improvement  (AC&I)  moneys  being  funneled  toward 
research and developmental (R&D) concepts. Yet another contract enforcement flaw 
became apparent as the term ‘‘innovativeness’’ was often inserted by the contractors 
and  accepted  by  the  Deepwater  program  for  what  would  otherwise  be  categorized 
as R&D initiatives. How else could the VUAV which only existed as a scaled model 
of  a  potential  aircraft  option,  shipboard  radars  with  never  before  achieved  acquisi-
tion and detection capabilities, stern ramp designs on ships the size of the NSC, or 
the  original  CASA  proposal  which  was  at  best,  an  unproven  hybrid  of  other  CASA 
platforms have survived the award process. Each of the above are representative ex-
amples  of  concepts  which  have  since,  crashed  when  sized  up  from  the  model,  have 
been substituted by more conventional designs, or replaced in their entirety. 

As  for  the  System’s  Integrator,  this  entity  was  advertised  to  be  the  glue  that 
pulled all the individual asset pieces together into a collective product with measur-

62 

able and increased performance returns. Individual assets were to mutually support 
and/or augment each other. New asset ‘‘cradle to grave’’ logistic supporting require-
ments, maintenance activities, workforce apportionments, funding streams, and leg-
acy  asset  sustainment  and  replacement  schedules  were  all  intersecting  challenges 
that  were  supposed  to  be  more  efficiently  and  effectively  managed  through  the  use 
of the System’s Integrator. Much of these advertised Integrator outcomes have failed 
to materialize. 

New asset logistic improvements, both processes and supporting IT systems have 
been painfully absent. Throughout the shortened life of the first delivered asset, the 
123′,  logistic  support  and  complete  supply  chain  management  for  Deepwater  intro-
duced  equipment  was  marginal  at  best.  The  story  doesn’t  improve  much  for  the 
other surface assets. Although there is more than enough positive rhetoric from the 
contractor and the Deepwater program, the fact that NSC 1 is now floating and get-
ting  closer  to  an  operational  status  with  many  of  the  needed  logistical  support  de-
tails  and  deliverables  still  ill  defined,  is  indeed  troubling.  Although  the  ICGS  posi-
tion  that  a  particular  shipboard  system  will  be  supported  by  a  performance-based 
contract is indeed refreshing and in alignment with many other government support 
strategies,  a  failure  to  produce  any  concrete  examples  of  either  the  breadth  and 
depth  of  these  contracts,  and  more  importantly  where  the  gaps  will  exist  between 
performance-based contract boundaries was the state of affairs when I left the Coast 
Guard  last  June;  I  am  unaware  if  much  has  changed  since.  The  fact  that  the  Inte-
grator failed to adequately respond to repeated calls for surface asset logistic details, 
failed to utilize or show any real purpose of the expensive Business Process Assess-
ment  and  Redesign  initiatives,  benignly  watched  as  replacement  after  replacement 
rotated  through  the  top  position  of  the  Contractor’s  logistic  organization  begs  the 
question;  where  is  the  return  on  the  investment  for  this  high  priced  Integrator?  I 
submit  that  this  was  and  still  is  one  of  the  biggest  contract  flaws  associated  the 
Deepwater  program.  The  Coast  Guard  relied  on  significant  Integrator  involvement, 
influence  and  accountability  to  enable  the  System  of  Systems  acquisition  strategy. 
The  Integrator’s  seemingly  absent  influence  in  key  areas  expected  by  the  contract 
and  their  very  real  complicity  in  why  we’re  here  today  can  not  be  overlooked  when 
its  painfully  obvious  that  many  of  the  initial  contract  strategies,  requirements  and 
deliverables  which  the  Integrator  was  to  be  a  significant  enabler  have  either  failed 
or  are  failing.  Coast  Guard  management  of  the  program  is  not  without  fault  for 
these failures, but neither is what was billed by the elements of G–ADW and subse-
quently G–D, our ‘‘Strategic Partner’’, the Integrator. 
My Entry Into the Program and the G–ADW (G–D) culture 

I  was  already  aware  of  the  basic  Deepwater  contract  strategy  through  a  variety 
of  the  internal  Coast  Guard  publications  prior  to  my  official  entry  on  November 
2000 into the Deepwater experience as G–SDW. Unfortunately, I was already aware 
of  what  was  rumored  to  be  troubling  organizational  differences  between  the  ele-
ments  of  the  G–ADW  (predecessor  of  G–D)  organization  and  many  of  the  Coast 
Guard  Headquarter  Directorate  personnel.  In  short  order,  I  would  find  that  these 
rumors  were  indeed  very  valid  organizational  problems  which,  in  my  opinion  were 
critical and fundamental flaws in the execution of the planned acquisition strategy. 
Traditionally,  and  in  accordance  with  the  Systems  Acquisition  Manual  (SAM),  any 
major  acquisition  relies  on  the  careful  blending  of  the  various  Coast  Guard  Direc-
torates’  resources  into  what  may  be  categorized  as  a  purposefully  designed  set  of 
acquisition  checks  and  balances.  In  the  simplest  of  terms  and  using  only  three  of 
the many acquisition supporting Directorates as an example, the Operational Direc-
torate  would  assist  with  the  development  of  the  Mission  Needs  Statement,  Oper-
ations Requirement Document and other operational related criteria. The Engineer-
ing  Directorate  would  assist  with  the  necessary  design  standards,  procedures, 
sustainment  requirements  and  assessments  to  ensure  that  the  Acquisition  Direc-
torate’s intended procurement would fulfill the mission needs established by the Op-
erations  Directorate.  Although  the  Acquisition  Directorate  was  ultimately  respon-
sible  for  balancing  cost,  schedule  and  performance,  the  remaining  support  Direc-
torates  were  fully  aware  of,  and  greatly  appreciative  of  the  sometimes  uncompro-
mising  cost,  schedule  and  performance  decisions.  The  Operations  Directorate  fo-
cused  on  operational  capabilities  and  performance.  The  Engineering  Directorate 
would  focus  primarily  on  delivery  performance  and  its  long-term  corresponding  ele-
ments  of  logistics  and  maintenance  sustainment.  As  proven  with  other  recent  and 
successful Coast Guard major acquisitions (WLB/WLM and Great Lakes Icebreaker), 
this  very  ‘‘healthy’’  balance  and  tension  was  expected  to  ensure  the  Coast  Guard 
bought and built something it needed, could operate, and maintain for the expected 
life  of  the  particular  asset.  With  the  Deepwater  program,  there  would  be  nothing 
‘‘healthy’’ about this balance. From the outset, this unhealthy situation, whose gen-

esis  lies  imbedded  in  the  overall  procurement  strategy,  and  the  allowance  granted 
to  the  Deepwater  program  to  deviate  from  the  SAM,  would  virtually  compromise 
any chance for a successful execution of the Deepwater procurement plan. 

In  my  capacity  as  the  Engineering  Logistic  Center’s  Platform  Manager  (tour 
length  from  Summer  1998  to  November  2000),  I  had  the  opportunity  to  witness 
firsthand some of the new acquisition strategy concepts and how they would impact 
‘‘traditional’’  acquisition  processes.  One  such  instance  was  during  the  ‘‘review’’  and 
‘‘reclassification’’  of  hundreds  of  G–S  previously  provided  engineering  and  ship  de-
sign, construction and evaluation standards and principles. During this review proc-
ess,  I  witnessed  the  elements  of  G–ADW,  question  every  existing  standard  for  its 
alignment with the ‘‘System of Systems’’ strategy and its reliance on the contractor 
to  be  held  only  to  delivering  an  asset  to  a  contractually-specified  ‘‘performance 
standard’’. Many existing engineering standards, procedures, criteria and testing re-
quirements  were  summarily  classified  as  ‘‘too  prescriptive’’  which  if  included  in  the 
certification matrix would unduly prevent the individual contract teams to be ‘‘inno-
vative’’.  The  fact  that  this  process  took  place  at  all  was  not  as  startling  to  me  as 
was  the  context  behind  the  Deepwater  Program’s  perceived  motive  for  its  purpose; 
changing  from  traditional  and  proven  asset  construction  procedures  and  standards 
to one where greater latitude was given to the contractor to do what was right when 
it came to designing and building the surface fleet. With full cognizance by the pro-
gram’s  leadership,  this  was  Deepwater’s  first  overt  act  of  dismantling  and  dis-
rupting the proven support directorate’s roles and responsibilities associated with a 
major  acquisition.  In  my  opinion,  this  was  yet  another  critical  program  mis-step 
which  placated  the  individual  industry  teams  at  the  expense  of  time-tested  and 
proven Coast Guard organic technical resources. This dangerous and repeated tactic 
of  contractor  appeasement  and  dismissing  unbiased  internal  Coast  Guard  technical 
assessments  and  recommendations  has  culminated  with  the  need  for  this  hearing. 
In  November  2000,  I  was  reassigned  as  an  off-season  transfer,  to  fill  the  position 
as the Chief Systems’ Deepwater Integration Office (G–SDW). I was responsible for 
the  integration  of  all  G–S’  organizational  responsibilities,  capabilities  and  technical 
input into the Deepwater acquisition. I had a staff of 10 personnel who represented 
the  disciplines  of  surface,  aviation,  logistic  and  C4ISR.  As  G–S’  Headquarter  staff 
for  Deepwater  support,  we  coordinated  and  integrated  the  acquisition  support  pro-
gram responsibilities and responses to their cognizant parts of the remaining inter-
nal and external pieces of the G–S organization. As an example, for the surface ele-
ment  of  my  staff,  this  meant  Deepwater  program  coordination  with  G–SEN,  ELC, 
the  CG  YARD,  and  both  MLCs.  I  reported  directly  to  G–S  and  had  frequent,  often 
daily meetings with my Admiral concerning the challenges and opportunities associ-
ated with Deepwater. From 2000 to 2002 this was RADM Ronald Silva. From 2002– 
2003,  this  was  RADM  Albert  Kinghorn.  As  their  direct  representative  to  the  Deep-
water program, I attended all Deepwater-related meetings which required 0–6 (Cap-
tain) presence and/or decisionmaking, and often represented or accompanied the Ad-
miral  at  those  meetings  requiring  Flag  presence.  Both  Admirals  trusted  me  implic-
itly and I had exceptionally wide latitude in not only speaking with G–S authority, 
but  also  establishing  specific  G–S  positions  on  a  variety  of  Deepwater-related  sub-
jects. 

Within  days  of  reporting  to  G–SDW,  getting  briefs  from  my  staff  elements  and 
visiting  the  corresponding  players  from  the  other  Directorates,  including  meetings 
with G–ADW, his deputy and his various APMs (program managers for the various 
assets),  it  was  immediately  apparent  that  the  rumors  of  organizational  problems 
were  very  real.  Since  G–ADW  was  identified  as  a  ‘‘Re-invention  Site’’  it  was  pro-
vided  deviation  status  from  the  existing  Coast  Guard  acquisition  manual  and  as  a 
result,  there  were  no  established  organizational  Roles  and  Responsibilities  with 
many  of  the  other  Directorates.  Moreover,  many  of  the  normal  acquisition  program 
necessities  were  being  developed  and  implemented  while  still  in  the  draft  or  early 
developmental stages. 

On a timeline, the Coast Guard was still in the pre-award stage. With three com-
peting industry teams, having enough resources to cover all of the program or direc-
torate  needs  was  a  constant  challenge  for  all  the  directorate  staffs  including  G– 
ADW.  It  was  during  this  hectic,  and  very  fast  paced  time  that  more  of  the  funda-
mental  program  aspects  and  the  concept  of  a  ‘‘System  of  Systems’’  strategy  with  a 
program  and  asset  integrator  became  better  defined.  It  was  also  during  this  pre- 
award  period  that  more  organizational  friction  points  were  spawned.  G–ADW  ele-
ments  started  using  the  phrase  ‘‘Change  Agent’’  more  frequently  and  the  Machia-
vellian  justification  of  the  program’s  ‘‘ends  will  justify  the  means’’  as  some  of  their 
overarching guiding principles. To G–ADW, their mandate was to inculcate this ac-
quisition  philosophy  change  and  its  resultant  organizational  upheavals  into  the 
Coast Guard. In simple terms, this meant that for real acquisition change to occur,

anything that mirrored the way something was currently done, or done in the past, 
could  not  be  a  part  of  the  Deepwater  acquisition  tactical  plan.  As  the  G–S  senior 
(with  the  exception  of  G–S  himself)  representative  to  the  program,  I  immediately 
sensed that the locked doors of the Deepwater spaces and controlled access afforded 
the G–ADW staff much more than just procurement security during the contract de-
velopment  and  pre-award  period.  It  was  a  very  convenient  mechanism  of  keeping 
all  but  ‘‘cleared’’  Coast  Guard  elements  from  entering  their  spaces  as  G–ADW  vir-
tually  isolated  themselves  purposefully  from  the  remainder  of  the  Coast  Guard.  Al-
though  all  of  the  SDW  and  other  Deepwater  support  directorate  staffs  were 
‘‘cleared’’  and  had  access  to  the  G–ADW  staff,  it  became  readily  apparent  from  my 
in  briefs  and  difficulty  in  getting  details  on  many  of  the  G–ADW  current  ‘‘goings- 
on’’ that the SDW staff was missing many important contract development and con-
tract  process  meetings.  We  were  ‘‘invited’’  to  only  those  meetings  and  strategy  ses-
sions  when  the  G–ADW  staff  thought  it  was  appropriate  to  do  so.  To  a  certain  ex-
tent, G–ADW had a 2-year jump on me and many of what proved to be flawed exe-
cution  strategies  and  tactics  were  already  in  place  and  firmly  inculcated  in  the  G– 
ADW  staff  elements.  My  first  direct  order  to  my  staff  was  ‘‘G–S  will  no  longer  be 
rolled  by  G–ADW’’,  followed  in  succession  by  ‘‘Attend  every  meeting  we’re  invited 
to,  and  barge  into  every  one  we  weren’t  invited  to  but  should  have’’,  and  finally, 
‘‘document  everything  and  act  with  my  authority  as  SDW’’.  The  SDW  staff  imme-
diately and with great zeal, increased our presence in the locked spaces of G–ADW 
and although unwanted by G–ADW, began asserting more of our traditional acquisi-
tion support roles and responsibilities. 

Concurrent  with  this,  we  increased  liaison,  communication  and  information  flows 
with  not  only  our  G–S  internal  and  external  Headquarter  staffs,  but  also  the  other 
acquisition  support  directorate  staffs.  Acknowledging  what  I  call  a  ‘‘mischief  gap’’ 
that  G–ADW  had  with  the  SAM  deviation  approval,  I  worked  to  close  this  opening 
by  establishing  a  formal  set  of  agreed  upon  roles  and  responsibilities  between  G– 
S  and  G–ADW  which  would  stabilize  and  hopefully  mend  broken  organizational 
fences.  Due  to  the  existing  anti-G–S  culture  within  G–ADW  and  the  reluctance  of 
the  existing  Deepwater  program  manager  to  even  entertain  such  an  initiative,  it 
took  over  8  months  of  concerted  effort  with  my  classmate  in  the  G–ADW  organiza-
tion while waiting for G–ADW to retire. Although only 6 relatively short paragraphs 
long,  this  roles  and  responsibilities  agreement  was  powerful  in  that  it  formally  es-
tablished a more defined relationship between G–S and G–D (note that by this time, 
G–ADW had been reclassified as G–D) elements. In simple terms, G–S was to estab-
lish  and  provide  the  engineering  and  logistical  expertise  and  advice  to  G–D.  G–D 
was to use these G–S provided inputs in the development of the program as it pro-
cured  new  assets  and  services.  This  agreement  also  accounted  for  any  unforeseen 
or non-existent policies, and instructed both organizations to collaborate together in 
their  development.  Signed  by  both  G–S,  RADM  Silva,  and  G–D,  RADM  Stillman, 
the memo was approved by the Coast Guard’s Vice Commandant, VADM Collins on 
27  July  2001.  Although  accepted  and  approved  by  the  highest  levels  of  both  Direc-
torates,  it  became  quickly  apparent  that  it  would  be  just  another  piece  of  Coast 
Guard policy that G–D elements would decide not to honor. If there was ever doubt 
before hand, it was now crystal clear that the bedrock placed by G–ADW was being 
cemented  in  place  by  G–D;  the  G–S  engineering  and  logistics  expertise  were  not  a 
priority.  Through  the  contract,  the  Deepwater  program  was  expected  to  be  sup-
ported by a ‘‘World Class’’ ship builder and their cognizant engineering design staffs. 
Any interim G–D program engineering expertise could be purchased through a mul-
titude of readily available engineering support contractors. Concurrent with this in-
tended  and  carefully  crafted  effort  to  minimize  the  need  for  any  G–S  technical  or 
logistic  input  was  the  steady  build-up  of  a  duplicative  naval  engineering  technical 
capability within the G–D staff elements. Initially advertised as nothing more than 
additional  engineering  resources  to  ‘‘manage’’  the  surface  portions  of  the  contract, 
these  same  naval  engineering  elements,  both  military  and  subcontractors,  quickly 
became the mouth pieces of the contractor and virtually squashed any and all engi-
neering  design,  maintenance  and  sustainment  concerns  from  the  G–S  engineers. 
This  ‘‘World  Class’’  ship  builder  reference  would  be  used  time  and  time  again  by 
the G–D elements whenever a difference of technical or logistical positions between 
G–S  and  G–D  occurred.  With  the  ‘‘World  Class’’  industry  partners  giving  G–D  all 
the  input  they  needed,  the  G–S  assessments,  concerns  and  recommendations  were 
often  given  nothing  more  than  lip  service  and  summarily  dismissed.  As  will  be  dis-
cussed  shortly,  the  Integrated  Process  Team  (IPT)  environment  would  be  the  cook-
ing  crucible  for  many  heated  discussions  which  primarily  sided  with  the  G–D,  and 
the industry position.

The Integrated Process Teams (IPTs), a Missed Opportunity 

65 

A key process management ingredient of the Deepwater strategy was the tactical 
execution  of  IPTs.  These  teams  were  comprised  of  representatives  of  G–D,  the  pro-
gram supporting Directorates, and industry personnel. They existed at every aspect 
and  every  level  of  the  program  from  the  strategic  Flag  level,  Overarching  IPT 
(OIPT) and 0–6 Integrating IPTs (IIPT), to the more tactical Long Range Interceptor 
IPT  which  often  consisted  of  Lieutenants  and  below.  Typically  chaired  by  either 
ICGS or G–D elements, they were touted as the entities where the majority of prob-
lems  and  issues  would  be  resolved.  Enhanced  communications,  collaboration,  con-
sensus  and  sound  program  decisions  were  expected  characteristics  of  each  IPT.  Al-
though  some  IPTs  were  more  successful  than  others,  most  did  not  function  as 
planned  for  a  variety  of  reasons;  newness  of  the  concept  with  poor  training,  trust 
issues, communication issues, resource issues, etc. Of all the IPTs, the surface IPTs 
in specific were the most volatile. It is safe to say that for the most part, the entire 
category of surface IPTs, (NSC, OPC, FRC, 123, etc.) became cauldrons of discourse, 
resentment, mistrust, and even more caustic organizational fractures. 

The  immediate  disagreement  of  established  roles  and  responsibilities  (in  spite  of 
the signed G–D/G–S memo) was in my opinion the singular cause for these IPT fail-
ures. A careful investigation of all surface IPT problems will track back to this criti-
cally important disagreement. With the recently signed Flag memo which stipulated 
G–S  and  G–D  roles  and  responsibilities,  G–SDW  thought  it  now  had  the  backing 
of  the  Vice  Commandant  to  ensure  our  voice,  concerns  and  recommendations  were 
‘‘honestly’’ evaluated as part of the IPT format. The G–S recommendations not incor-
porated were expected to at least be explained and documented as part of the IPT’s 
decision process. Rarely did this occur. Since I was leading the G–S charge for incor-
porating the organizational roles signed by both G–D, G–S and approved by the Vice 
Commandant, I highlighted the program’s overt flaunting of these roles at every op-
portunity.  As  one  might  expect,  the  IIPT  was  on  more  than  one  occasion  a  very 
caustic environment. 

Since  all  G–S  surface  IPT  members  worked  either  directly  or  indirectly  for  me, 
as  G–SDW,  I  ensured  that  each  G–S  representative  knew  their  approved  role  and 
at  every  IPT  level,  I  was  continually  aware  of  the  program’s  flagrant  failure  to  re-
spect and comply with the Flag agreement. In that regard, they all acted by my di-
rection.  The  G–S  role  was  a  critical  program  ‘‘check,  balance,  and  technical  assess-
ment and recommendation’’ necessity. With my years of engineering experience and 
variety  of  assignments,  I  had  sufficient  personal  knowledge  of  the  qualifications, 
personal attributes, and technical capabilities of most, if not all of the internal and 
external  G–S  and  MLC  logisticians  and  engineers  who  supported  the  Deepwater 
program  with  their  thousands  of  years  of  proven  engineering  and  logistical  exper-
tise.  With  the  Flag  memo  in  hand,  I  was  not  about  to  let  this  invaluable  and  irre-
placeable  organic  Coast  Guard  capability  be  silently  dismissed.  In  doing  so,  I  en-
sured  that  each  G–S  IPT  representative  complied  with  the  IPT  rules  for  discussing 
our  inputs,  concerns,  recommendations  and  documenting  the  IPT  outcomes.  It 
should  be  no  surprise  that  the  level  of  documentation  on  these  related  issues  prob-
ably  differs  significantly  between  what’s  retained  by  G–D  and  G–S  elements.  We 
knew that with each and every dismissed G–S technical and logistic assessment and 
recommendation, we were traveling down a path that many, even very early in the 
program saw as an impending ‘‘train wreck’’. The continual discussion within many 
G–S  and  MLC  staffs  was  not  if  the  wreck  was  going  to  happen,  but  how  extensive 
it would be when it happened. 

Although  the  continual  role  disagreement  was  a  significant  causal  factor  in  the 
surface  IPTs  struggles  to  become  functional  entities,  it  was  not  the  lone  culprit. 
Other  progress  inhibitors  such  as  the  actual  IPTs  membership,  who  decided  who 
was to be a member, who the members worked for, how meetings were coordinated, 
managed,  and  documented,  how  problems  were  resolved,  and  how  the  IPTs  would 
make decisions were noteworthy issues which were hallmarks of the early IPT trou-
bles. 

IPT  mechanics,  intended  characteristics  and  processes  were  described  in  the 
Deepwater program’s Project Maintenance Plan (PMP). The PMP, would be the tac-
tical  execution  of  G–D’s  Deepwater  contract  strategy.  To  no  surprise,  many  of  the 
PMPs elements immediately became discussion hotspots. G–D wanted all IPT mem-
bers to report to the IPT chair. Seeing this as a potential tactic to not only function-
ally, but also organizationally ‘‘control’’ and, or ‘‘manage’’ the IPT direction, this G– 
D  desire  was  met  with  significant  resistance  with  hard  lines  ‘‘drawn  in  the  sand’’ 
from  both  G–S  and  the  G–O  IIPT  representatives;  other  non-G–D  IIPT  representa-
tives  followed  suit.  In  our  view,  to  ensure  that  the  supporting  organization’s  rep-
resentatives  could  confidently  and  safely,  for  their  careers  or  employment  for  those

civilian  personnel,  provide  unbiased  input  and  report  back  factual  developments  or 
concerns, they needed to stay out from under the thumb of the G–D IPT leads. 

Early  IPT  problems  also  raised  the  concern  over  who  actually  would  determine 
IPT  membership  representatives.  On  more  than  one  occasion,  the  surface  IPT  lead 
tried  exerting  his  authority  and  remove  G–S  surface  IPT  representatives  as  formal 
members. Ostensibly the reason and justification was the IPT members were disrup-
tive to any positive and necessary IPT decisionmaking. Although, it was not uncom-
mon  for  the  G–S  IPT  representatives  to  have  strong  and  vociferous  mannerisms  in 
fulfilling their IPT roles, in my opinion, it was the critical discussions and concerns 
that  these  G–S  IPT  members  had  on  any  particular  engineering  or  logistic  issue 
that  was  the  real  underlying  reasoning  for  their  desired  removal  from  the  IPT  by 
G–D  APMs.  I  thwarted  this  effort  in  both  my  SDW  and  later  in  my  ELC  Com-
manding Officer capacity. 

Early  IPT  functionality  was  compromised  by  poor  IPT  management.  Meetings 
were  often  poorly  advertised  with  sometimes  only  hours  to  respond,  poorly  docu-
mented  or  with  the  many  resource  challenges,  poorly  attended.  Established  IPT 
agendas,  with  intended  discussion  items  and  articulated  desired  outcomes  were 
rare.  With  the  plethora  of  possible  issues,  having  knowledgeable,  capable  resources 
at  the  meetings  was  of  a  paramount  importance  to  everyone.  When  these  technical 
areas were covered with personal assets sometimes only one deep, it was critical to 
have  the  right  person  with  the  right  talents  and  skills  at  the  right  meeting.  Due 
to  poor  agenda  management,  on  more  than  one  occasion  the  G–S  IPT  member  was 
not  the  best  available  choice.  In  these  circumstances,  the  G–S  IPT  representative 
would implement a ‘‘reach-back’’ effort to the more knowledgeable subject matter ex-
pert.  This  ‘‘reach  back’’  model  was  not  readily  accepted  by  G–D  elements  as  an  ac-
ceptable  IPT  representative  strategy  and  was  often  ridiculed  as  not  providing  deci-
sionmaking ‘‘empowered’’ resources. In spite of this false ‘‘empowerment’’ claim, the 
‘‘reach  back’’  model  worked  very  well  for  G–S  and  enabled  a  much  more  effective 
and  efficient  use  of  the  limited  AC&I  funded  project  resources.  Rarely  was  the  ab-
sence  of  a  G–S  IPT  member  the  cause  of  not  making  a  decision.  To  the  contrary, 
it was because of our continued presence that planned IPT lead decisions were thor-
oughly  discussed,  evaluated  and  often  questioned  for  supporting  details  and  jus-
tification.  Unfortunately,  because  of  the  induced  time  criticality  of  many  program 
decision  steps,  the  engineering  decisions  which  would  normally  require  and  await 
much  greater  exploration  and  analysis,  were  made  in  the  face  of  the  G–S  IPT  rep-
resentative’s  objection.  The  advertised  IPT  desire  to  achieve  collaboration  and  con-
sensus would quickly deviate to a model of unexplained or poorly justified IPT uni-
lateral  decisions  by  the  IPT  chair.  This  pervasive  program  tactic  would  come  back 
to haunt the Coast Guard with the time driven pursuit of the 123′ and NSC. 

The PMP did identify an agreed upon IPT problem resolution process. It was the 
expected responsibility of each IPT to make the maximum effort to resolve problems 
at the lowest level. When the circumstances prevented this, any particular non-con-
sensus voting representative could raise the particular issue to the next higher IPT 
for  discussion  and  possible  resolution.  It  was  expected  that  the  higher  level  IPT 
would  quickly  decide  the  issue  and  give  task  direction  to  the  lower  IPT  so  as  not 
to  negatively  impede  the  time  criticality  of  the  overall  schedule.  Due  to  the  some-
times  overwhelming  number  of  IPT  non-consensus  decisions  at  all  levels,  this  per-
fect  decision  resolution  scenario  rarely  was  the  timely  solution  it  was  hoped  to  be. 
Moreover,  an  additional  IPT,  between  the  IIPT  and  the  OPIT  was  inserted  after 
contract award. It was co-chaired by the G–D and ICGS Program Managers and was 
titled  the  Program  Management  Team  (PMT).  The  PMT’s  membership  consisted  of 
senior  G–D,  ICGS  and  other  contractor  personnel.  With  the  exception  of  the  G–O 
Deepwater  0–6  representative  who  was  allowed  to  ‘‘call-in’’,  there  was  no  non-G–D 
routine  presence  at  the  meeting.  It  was  advertised,  that  if  a  G–S-related  decision 
was  to  be  discussed  at  the  PMT,  the  G–D  PM  would  make  every  effort  to  ensure 
a G–S representative would be notified in a timely manner to be part of the discus-
sion.  If  for  whatever  reason  our  presence  wasn’t  possible,  or  an  ‘‘unexpected’’  G–S 
related discussion topic just happened to surface at the PMT, the G–D PM felt com-
fortable  he  could  represent  any  G–S  concerns.  The  fact  that  the  PMT  was  between 
the  IIPT  and  the  OMPT,  by  IPTs  rules  meant  that  any  IIPT  disagreement  that 
would normally be brought up to the OIPT for resolution first needed to go thought 
the PMT. This became a very convenient joint G–D/ICGS mechanism to resolve pro-
gram  problems  that  escaped  0–6  solutions  but  didn’t  need  Flag  involvement.  With 
no  routine  G–S  presence  we  were  often  trying  to  reverse  PMT  ‘‘agreed  upon’’  deci-
sions  after  the  fact.  Even  when  I  or  my  deputy  was  invited  for  the  discussion,  we 
were not voting members. As a result, it was unreasonable to expect our discussion 
points  to  convince  enough  of  the  18  G–D  or  ICGS  PMT  members  to  reach  a  favor-
able  G–S  decision.  Needless  to  say,  G–S  was  advised  of  these  IIPT  disagreement

areas for eventual Flag to Flag discussions with G–D directly or as part of an OIPT 
‘‘non-agenda’’  discussion  topic.  Sadly,  the  G–S  influence  or  objection,  even  at  the 
Flag level rarely carried the day and those that did would not have occurred without 
the direct support of the G–O Flag. 

I suspect with the plethora of non-concensus and troubling IPT decisions, and the 
relatively slow progression of these concerns through each subsequent IPT level, the 
contract’s  time  reality  somewhat  supported  the  G–D  APM’s  pretext  to  unilaterally 
make  their  best  decision  and  keep  the  program  running  forward,  a  concept  I  fun-
damentally agree with. Unfortunately, what became very disturbing was the unusu-
ally  high  frequency  at  which  this  unilateral  decision  oddly  turned  out  to  be  more 
aligned  with  the  Deepwater  contractor’s  position  than  G–S’.  As  will  be  discussed 
later in the events surrounding the 123′ WPB, the G–D position that the initial G– 
S  123′  WPB  technical  concerns  were  unwarranted,  was  formally  transmitted  to  G– 
S  as  follows:  the  ICGS  engineering  analysis  was  ‘‘good  enough’’  and  the  123′  will 
move  forward  as  planned.  The  fact  that  all  eight  123′  WPB’s  suffered  major  struc-
tural  failures,  and  are  non-functional  Coast  Guard  assets  is  indicative  of  the  dan-
gers implicit with time driven decisions. With the constant reminder from the PEO 
himself, his deputy and PM for ‘‘ruthless execution of the contract’’, more and more 
time-based  decisions  would  take  priority  over  the  performance  concerns  raised  by 
G–S. The ‘‘Iron Triangle’’ phrase of cost schedule and performance as coined by the 
G–D PM, was in more reality less a triangle and more of a rod with the only meas-
urable  dimensions  of  cost  and  schedule;  performance  in  my  opinion  was  becoming 
nothing  more  than  a  necessary  word  to  be  included  with  the  other  two.  As  long  as 
the asset was delivered reasonably close to the planned delivery date, all was essen-
tially  well.  Whatever  performance  we  acquired  with  the  asset  would  be  computed 
into  the  OpEff  model  and  if  not  sufficient  or  of  the  expected  level,  it  would  be  ac-
counted for by the contractor in later asset improvements or capabilities in the very 
fluid system-of-systems grand plan. For example, any failure of the NSC to achieve 
the  SPS  required  speed  of  28  knots  (which  was  still  very  much  in  question  when 
I  departed  the  service)  was  not  as  important  as  was  meeting  the  scheduled  NSC 
delivery date. So how will the contractor be held accountable? 

During  these  early  IPT  ‘‘storming’’  evolutions,  a  new  G–D  initiated  phrase  and 
contract strategy was further defined. With the expected value-add of ‘‘World Class’’ 
ship builders, and the fact that the contract enabled them to be innovative in deliv-
ering ‘‘performance’’, the desired expectation of the supporting directorate IPT mem-
bers was that they only need to acquire ‘‘insight’’ into the contractor’s proposal and 
planned asset details. The traditional government requirement for contractor ‘‘over-
sight’’ was not part of the new acquisition strategy and ‘‘change agent’’ concepts. Re-
gardless,  ‘‘oversight’’  of  the  contractor  was  not  to  be  a  G–S  concern.  Any  discussion 
with  G–D  elements  where  the  term  ‘‘oversight’’  was  used  by  G–S  personnel  was 
quickly corrected by senior program elements. Although it might not have been the 
G–S-specified responsibility for contract ‘‘oversight’’, this more benign G–D ‘‘insight’’ 
perspective  and  greater  expectation  that  the  contractor  would  do  the  right  thing  in 
providing  us  the  contracted  System  of  Systems  performance  was  indeed  very  trou-
bling. In spite of the G–D staff’s continual corrections, many in G–S were very con-
cerned with what appeared to be G–D’s laissez faire ‘‘oversight’’ position. 

For  the  most  part,  these  IPT  realities  and  program  disagreements  plagued  and 
challenged program progress from years before release of the RFP and well past the 
award date. Most were still very active when I left SDW in the Spring of 2003 and 
were  still  raging  even  after  I  retired  in  2006.  As  such,  the  inability  to  effectively 
function  at  the  lowest  level  of  the  program  significantly  hampered  virtually  every 
expected and projected contract deliverable. This dysfunctional IPT problem was not 
news to anyone despite the carefully crafted Quad charts and reporting instruments 
by  the  program  staff  which  typically  minimized  the  reality.  As  I  did  with  my  Flag 
in G–S, I feel confident the other IIPT members kept their Flags advised of the IPT 
troubles.  Although  the  articulated  position  from  senior  G–D  personnel  was  always 
of  support  and  talked  up  the  need  for  collaborative  IPT  decisions,  it  was  also  com-
mon knowledge that these same G–D senior personnel were losing patience with G– 
S’  continual  requests  for  additional  information,  analysis  or  testing.  G–S  perform-
ance  warnings  conflicted  with  the  advertised  performance  attributes  stipulated  by 
the ICGS elements and trying to resolve them failed to conveniently mesh with the 
delivery  schedule  expectations.  G–S’  ‘‘conservatism’’  was  being  cast  by  G–D  senior 
personnel  as  obstructing  timely  contract  progress.  As  time  progressed,  the  terms  of 
obstructionists and G–S were becoming linked by not only G–D elements but others 
as  well.  Those  who  knew  of  the  future  we  foresaw  also  knew  that  tagging  G–S  as 
an  ‘‘obstructionists’’  was  completely  inappropriate.  Again,  the  123′  WPB  non-per-
formance  realities,  the  G–S-induced  necessity  to  develop  an  alternative  Fast  Re-
sponse  Cutter  (FRC)  design  and  contract  strategy,  and  the  current  NSC  structural

and  performance  issues  seem  to  validate  that  time  and  money  probably  could  have 
been better spent. 
The 110′ to 123′ Patrol Boat Conversion 

Due to the rather significant funding constrains established by G–ADW at the be-
ginning  of  the  program,  all  three  industry  teams  would  be  indeed  challenged  to 
squeeze  new  asset  replacements  and  the  sustainment  of  the  legacy  deepwater  fleet 
into  a  workable  plan.  The  ICGS  proposal  devised  what  I  always  thought  was,  if 
achievable,  an  elegant  concept  and  solution  for  the  aging  110′  Patrol  Boat  class. 
With the 110′ hull deterioration issues articulated to all of the industry teams well 
in  advance  of  the  RFP  issuance,  each  team  had  the  opportunity  to  incorporate  this 
‘‘known 110′ WPB hull condition’’ into their plans or contract bids. ICGS’s pre-award 
plan  always  included  a  ‘‘stretched’’  110′,  and  the  hull  condition  was  accounted  for 
with  a  ‘‘bided’’  amount  of  expected  hull  replacement.  Collectively  their  proposal 
would lengthen the 110 feet to 123 feet with a stern extension and make other hull 
replacement  efforts  as  needed  so  the  life  of  the  new  123′  WPB  would  coincide  with 
the  FRC  introduction  where  more  funding  flexibility  seemed  to  exist.  Although  an 
elegant concept solution, the G–S engineers almost immediately started raising con-
cerns of both the stern launch design and the overall engineering and model testing 
analysis  of  the  entire  platform,  which  included  the  Short  Range  Prosecutor  (SRP). 
While in the pre-award phase, Coast Guard Technical Assistance Teams (TAT) were 
severely limited in the level of actual ‘‘engineering evaluations’’ and ability to trans-
mit detected problems to any of the industry teams. All communication transmittals 
were  really  limited  to  asking  how  their  proposal  would  address  a  particular  prob-
lem. The level of communication and interchange was expected to change drastically 
after  award  in  the  IPT  environment  with  collaboration  and  consensus  the  way  of 
doing business. 
With  the  123′  WPB  designated  as  the  first  delivered  ICGS  Deepwater  asset,  it 
was the first to get real intense G–S engineering and logistic reviews concerning the 
corresponding details unavailable during the pre-award period. Unfortunately, even 
in  this  new,  less  constrained  contract  environment,  the  engineering  details  sur-
rounding  the  planned  extension  were  less  than  desired  by  G–S  engineers.  During 
IPT  meetings,  at  all  levels,  a  consistent  message  was  coming  from  the  G–S  rep-
resentatives; we were concerned about the stern ramp, how the SRP and 123′ would 
act  as  a  unit  in  the  same  sea-way,  and  the  overall  structural  integrity  of  the  110′ 
hull girder. Repeated requests were made for the timely delivery of the contract re-
quired  CDRLs  which  hopefully  would  include  some  of  the  needed  engineering  anal-
ysis  to  answer  these  questions.  Concurrent  with  these  requests  were  the  arrival  of 
scheduled contract ‘‘review gates’’ that supposedly were to be successfully negotiated 
prior  to  progressing  forward  with  the  release  of  a  Delivery  Task  Order  (DTO)  au-
thorizing additional ICGS work. 

These  gates  consisted  of  a  Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR),  a  Contract  Design 
Review  (CDR),  and  a  Production  Readiness  Review  (PRR),  all  of  which  needed  to 
be successfully completed prior to awarding the DTO to initiate the 1st 110′ conver-
sion. Documentation exists that clearly indicates G–S’ engineering concerns with the 
lack of received CDRLs and the corresponding engineering analysis to enable a suc-
cessful pass though each and every one of these contract gates. In spite of these doc-
umented  concerns,  the  G–D  surface  APM  concluded,  from  non-unanimous  IPT  in-
puts  (G–S  and  G–O  objected),  that  the  contractor  had  successfully  completed  first 
the  PDR  in  October  2002,  then  the  CDR  in  December  2002  and  finally  the  PRR  in 
January  2003.  As  a  schedule-driven  decision,  this  very  quick  completion  of  three 
major  contract  gates  enabled  the  timely  arrival  of  the  CGC  MATAGORDA  in  Feb-
ruary 2003 and the start of what would be an ill-fated hull extension. It was during 
the  accelerated  contract  completion  of  these  gates  where  the  ICGS  provided  engi-
neering  analysis  for  the  110′  conversion  was  deemed  as  ‘‘good  enough’’  by  the  G– 
D  surface  APM.  With  the  impending  APM  unilateral  decision,  I  ensured  the  IIPT 
was  advised  and  warned  that  the  110′  PDR,  CDR  and  PRR  were  to  be  inappropri-
ately declared successful. Even with the strongest objections at each and every con-
tract  review  step,  my  voice  and  my  IIPT  vote  was  clearly  insufficient  as  the  G–D 
PM concurred with his APM’s decision each and every time. Even when any chance 
of  winning  the  IIPT  seemed  lost,  a  last  plea  for  caution  was  proposed  by  G–SDW; 
build  only  one  123′  WPB  as  a  full  scale  prototype  and  test  the  hull  structure  and 
the  SRP  interface  with  the  stern  ramp.  If  the  design  appeared  sound  after  a  pre-
scribed  test  and  evaluation  period,  the  subsequent  DTO’s  could  be  released  to  re-
start the 110′ modification line. This was also dismissed due to overriding schedule 
and  cost  priorities.  With  all  options  seemingly  lost,  in  December  2002,  G–S  sent  a 
memo  to  G–D  indicating  that  because  of  our  overall  engineering  concerns  with  the 
123′  WPB,  no  additional  G–S  controlled  maintenance  moneys  would  be  directed  to

MATAGORDA  after  the  cutter’s  departure.  This  memo,  along  with  virtually  every 
other engineering concern G–S could muster failed to slow down the schedule driven 
123′ WPB conversion process. 
Very  similar  G–S  concerns  with  the  ICGS  123′  WPB  logistic  support  plan  were 
running  concurrent  with  the  above  cutter  extension  part  of  the  project.  Observing 
what  appeared  to  be  a  significant  logistic  capability  gap  in  ICGS’  proposal,  G–S  of-
fered a ‘‘bridging logistic strategy’’ which would enable adequate logistic supply sup-
port until the ICGS logistic concept was ready for deployment. As with the engineer-
ing  memo,  this  one  was  also  disregarded  by  G–D  acting  under  the  advice  of  the 
ICGS  logistic  support  staff.  The  conversion  results,  the  current  non-operational  use 
of the 123′ WPBs and the wholly inadequate 123′ WPB logistic support system expe-
rienced  during  their  shortened  life  speak  loudly  of  how  the  influence  of  the  Deep-
water  contractor  on  the  G–D  APM’s  performance  related  decision  points  negatively 
influenced the final delivered performance of these assets. 
The National Security Cutter (NSC) Design Issues 

With  the  unilateral  G–D  surface  APM  decisions  still  fresh  from  the  123′  project, 
in  early  2003  many  in  G–S  were  openly  referring  to  the  NSC  as  a  contract  repeat 
of  the  123′.  That  said,  NSC  designs  issues  followed  a  very  similar  path  to  that  of 
the  110′/123′  WPB  extension  project  in  that  even  before  the  RFP  was  issued  and 
the  contract  awarded  to  ICGS,  G–S  IPT  elements  had  a  relatively  long  and  critical 
list  of  NSC  design  concerns.  In  addition  to  the  current  and  outstanding  structural 
issues, G–S had concerns with the stern ramp interface and the fact that the origi-
nal NSC design had no other small boat launch and retrieval system. So significant 
was this concern that G–S conducted a worldwide survey of existing stern ramp con-
figurations  and  only  after  very  conclusive  findings  did  the  first  NSC  design  get 
modified for the inclusion of a side launch capability for the Long Range Interceptor 
(LRI);  its  unsure  if  this  side  launch  capability  will  be  incorporated  on  subsequent 
NSC designs. 

Although  this  particular  design  issue  was  a  success,  the  structural  issues  raged 
with  the  NSC  IPT  members  virtually  at  a  standstill  for  any  progress.  With  no  risk 
mitigation  strategy  apparent  and  no  perceived  hope  of  resolution  at  the  NSC  IPT 
level, in accordance with the PMP, this concern was raised to the 0–5 level System 
Engineering IPT (SEIT) in the early Fall of 2002. As with the NSC IPT, no apparent 
progress  was  forthcoming  with  the  SEIT  and  in  the  same  2002  timeframe,  it  was 
brought officially to the attention to the IIPT. Note however that all during this tu-
multuous  duration  at  the  lower  IPTs,  it  was  a  brewing  storm  that  the  IIPT  was 
watching  and  knew  was  coming.  Likewise  with  the  123′  process,  NSC  DTOs  were 
scheduled  for  release  to  ensure  the  advertised  delivery  of  NSC  1.  Concurrent  with 
a  planned  IIPT  discussion  of  the  NSC  structural  issues,  a  meeting  was  held  with 
G–S, G–O, the PEO, many of the G–D senior staff and even some ICGS senior mem-
bers were present when elements of the ELC staff who supported the NSC IPT, for-
mally presented in great detail the basis for their engineering concerns and forecast 
of  future  performance  problems.  Unfortunately  this  meeting  failed  to  gain  the  de-
sired  outcome  as  even  in  the  presence  of  three  Flag  officers,  the  level  of  distrust 
and friction that existed between the ELC, G–D and ICGS personnel related to the 
NSC, compromised any cogent and structured discussion. Subsequent discussions at 
the  IIPT  and  OIPT  also  failed  to  get  any  resolution,  and  in  spite  of  G–SDW  objec-
tions, the DTO to initiate the NSC construction and procurement of NSC Long Lead 
Time  material  was  awarded.  From  this  period,  a  variety  of  correspondence  moved 
back  and  forth  through  the  G–S  and  G–D  organizations  concerning  the  NSC  struc-
tural  issues.  At  one  point,  the  NSC  ICGS  representative  developed  singular  one 
page  rebuttals  on  how  each  of  the  structural  issues  had  been  resolved  to  the  point 
they  could  be  mitigated  and  removed  from  the  G–D-maintained  and  controlled  risk 
database.  In  spite  of  repeated  G–D  attempts  to  de-emphasize  the  seriousness  of 
these concerns, they were never mitigated successfully and still exist today. 

My  transfer  from  G–SDW  to  Commanding  Officer  at  the  ELC  in  May  2003  and 
the  arrival  of  a  new  SDW  and  G–S  later  that  summer  brought  a  new  strategy  in 
dealing with these apparent irresolvable issues. For all subsequent ELC or G–SDW 
engineering  concerns,  an  independent  analysis  and  confirmation  would  be  needed. 
Current  documentation  and  separate  DHS  IG  findings  have  since  provided  the  re-
sults  of  the  many  independent  studies  and  validations  of  the  G–S  initial  concerns. 
During the time, these independent studies occurred, precious and irretrievable time 
elapsed, DTOs were awarded and the NSC moved along its advertised schedule. One 
of the strongest warnings I provided to the IIPT prior to leaving the G–SDW assign-
ment  was  that  with  the  continued  construction  process  of  the  NSC,  and  many  of 
the  structural  concerns  dealing  with  the  hull  girder  itself,  if  upon  NSC  delivery  we 
finally  get  some  resolution  to  these  structural  problems,  it  will  be  too  late  for  the

Coast  Guard  to  economically  fix  the  problems.  Unfortunately,  this  is  exactly  where 
we  are  today.  Since  all  these  design  issues  started  before  any  DTO  was  released, 
the  Coast  Guard  missed  the  best  time  to  make  the  needed  design  changes  to  the 
NSC. In lieu of making the necessary changes while the NSC was still in the ‘‘elec-
tron  mode’’  and  absorb  what  would  have  been  at  best  a  relatively  minor  cost  in-
crease and possible schedule slippage, we wasted over 4 years of ‘‘opportunity’’ pass-
ing  memos  back  and  forth  avoiding  what  was  addressed  very  early  on  as  a  critical 
design  flaw.  Another  example  where  the  Integrator,  the  actual  NSC  construction 
contractor and the G–D staff seemed to align too quickly and conveniently to ensure 
the schedule was maintained at the expense of performance. 
The Fast Response Cutter (FRC) 
The FRC became yet another performance problem but not because of any initial 
concept  design  in  the  proposal.  Unlike  the  123′  and  the  NSC,  this  design  failure 
came  about  after  it  was  decided  at  the  very  highest  levels  of  the  Coast  Guard  that 
the  hull  was  to  be  of  a  composite  material  construction.  Almost  immediately  red 
flags  rose  from  G–S  elements  due  to  the  lack  of  existing  hulls  of  this  size  with  all 
composite hulls. Most of the subsequent IPT engagements and exchanges concerning 
the FRC occurred while I was the ELC Commanding Officer. The Deepwater organi-
zation  I  had  at  the  ELC  was  led  by  a  very  seasoned  GS–15  who  coordinated  with 
another GS–15 whose staff of civilian naval architects and engineers completed the 
engineering analysis of the proposed composite platform. As a result, I only engaged 
when  the  FRC  details  needed  Commanding  Officer  correspondence  signature  or  in-
fluence.  What  I  can  testify  to  is  that  the  analysis  indicated  serious  and  dramatic 
deviations  from  any  parametric  references  to  similar  hull  forms.  In  addition  to  the 
pure  naval  architecture  red  flags,  there  were  sustainment  and  maintenance  con-
cerns  for  a  composite  hull.  With  the  uniqueness  of  the  hull  material  fabrication 
techniques,  and  the  apparent  absence  of  any  known  large  or  small  shipyard,  with 
the exception of the Gulf Coast, to do eventual hull repairs in areas where the FRC 
would  normally  operate,  major  maintenance  or  repair  costs  needed  to  be  incor-
porated  in  the  overall  evaluation  and  eventually  mitigated.  Since  the  decision  to 
pursue  a  completely  different  FRC  procurement  strategy  occurred  after  I  left  the 
Coast Guard, I can’t talk with any authority on what really brought about this deci-
sion.  That  said,  I  have  to  believe  the  repeated  and  final  realization  of  previous  G– 
S engineering concerns with the 123′ and NSC may have finally tipped the balance 
that  maybe  it  should  be  the  G–S  engineers  and  not  the  ‘‘World  Class’’  shipbuilders 
that should have the majority vote when it comes to making engineering design de-
cisions. 
Funding and Personnel Resource Issues 

Any Deepwater related discussion can’t be made without accounting for the fund-
ing and personnel resource constraints. Although both were significant, I still firmly 
believe  that  the  overall  goal  of  this  contract;  a  complete  integration  of  new  surface 
and air assets with interoperable C4ISR capabilities and an integrated logistic sup-
port  system  spanning  the  entire  spectrum  of  supply  chain  management,  was  pos-
sible  without  the  need  for  a  system  integrator  nor  the  extravagant  and  complex 
Deepwater procurement strategy. It should be no surprise that I believe compliance 
with the SAM and its established ‘‘healthy’’ directorate tensions could have worked! 
Funding 

Concurrent  with  the  award  decision,  it  was  already  a  known  problem  that  fund-
ing,  both  AC&I  and  non-AC&I  accounts,  would  be  in  severe  jeopardy.  The  Oper-
ational  and  Support  (O&S)  CLINS  would  place  great  strains  on  the  remainder  of 
the  Coast  Guard’s  operational  budget.  G–S  elements  quickly  instituted  the  practice 
to  ‘‘fence  off’’  annual  funding  supporting  Deepwater  assets  from  non-Deepwater  as-
sets.  Based  on  significant  annual  increases  in  O&S  costs,  the  amount  of  money 
shunted  to  ICGS  to  support  the  new  Deepwater  assets  could  easily  and  relatively 
quickly require augmentation from the non-Deepwater fleet. 

Projected  AC&I  program  funds  needed  to  reasonably  manage  the  project  were 
knowingly deficient even before the release of the RFP. Personal conversations I ini-
tiated  with  the  most  senior  contract  and  management  levels  of  the  G–D  organiza-
tion  before  the  release  of  the  RFP  identified  no  accounting  for  any  cost  growth, 
needed contract changes or award fees. When the G–S 10–20 percent repair mainte-
nance  cost  metrics  for  growth  and  changes  were  used  as  examples  during  our  dis-
cussions,  it  became  quickly  apparent  to  these  G–D  officials  that  there  was  insuffi-
cient  reserve  in  the  AC&I  program’s  budget  to  account  for  this  inescapable  reality; 
there will be contract changes and there will be unexpected growth. A too simplistic 
answer  of,  we’ll  live  within  the  budget  and  fund  what  we  can  fund,  was  linked  to, 
this is a performance contract, and if the contractor doesn’t deliver the specified per-

formance, changes will be their cost to bear, or words to that effect. When the three 
industry  teams  were  building  proposals  to  utilize  every  spare  AC&I  dollar  allowed, 
this over simplification of a very real funding problem crippled many of the needed 
asset  modifications  and  resource  needs  early  in  the  program.  When  comparing  this 
reality  funding,  to  the  millions  of  dollars  provided  to  the  Integrator,  one  can’t  help 
but  raise  obvious  questions  if  the  limited  AC&I  funds  are  being  expended  most  ef-
fectively. 
Personnel Resources 

Personnel  resources  across  all  Directorates  would  be  severely  strained.  For  some 
reason  the  early  G–ADW  and  subsequent  G–D  personnel  resource  metrics  always 
referred to other acquisition programs and government organizations for a compari-
son of funds to bodies. This incorrect metric reference drove virtually all related re-
source  decisions  and  distributions.  At  one  point,  the  G–D  mandate  was  that  there 
would be no AC&I Full Time Equivalent (FTE) growth in FY04. As a result of these 
types  of  management  and  funding  induced  decisions,  personnel  shortages  were  felt 
across the board! It was hoped that the Integrator and the strength of the Contrac-
tor’s resources would help mitigate this resource capability gap. As the program was 
to  quickly  find  out,  this  did  not  materialize  and  as  greater  program  management 
‘‘oversight’’ was needed, there were simply not enough resources to cover the needs. 
During the initial program buildup, G–S developed a resource presentation that in-
dicated  an  additional  200  FTE  would  be  needed  in  G–S  alone  to  provide  the  ex-
pected  support  directorate  roles  for  the  initial  ‘‘transition’’  years  of  the  program. 
This  became  known  as  the  ‘‘Pig  in  the  Snake’’  presentation  because  of  the  analogy 
of  a  relatively  large  mass  being  accepted  and  eventually  run  through  the  organiza-
tion. Once the transition period was negotiated, it was expected that the final orga-
nization  would  be  smaller  because  of  the  ICGS-  provided  engineering,  logistic  and 
management support capabilities and efficiencies. This has yet to and will probably 
never materialize. 
Recommendations 

Other  than  what  I’ve  read  on  the  Internet,  newspapers  or  Navy  Times,  I’ve  had 
extremely  limited  knowledge  of  what  has  happened  with  the  Deepwater  program 
since  I  left  the  service  last  spring.  I’d  like  to  use  this  fact  as  a  qualifier  that  some 
of my following improvement recommendations for your consideration might already 
be taking place or may be unnecessary because of other Coast Guard organizational 
decisions which I have no knowledge. 

As  indicated  in  the  beginning  of  my  statement,  I  have  read  the  DHS  IG  report 
and  Admiral  Allen’s  testimony  on  this  subject  and  I  whole  heartily  agree  with  the 
IGs  findings  and  the  Admiral’s  initial  corrective  steps  to  solving  the  multitude  of 
Deepwater  problems.  Of  the  Admiral’s  actions,  the  formal  delineation  of  technical 
authority to G–S will have the most immediate positive returns. Had this organiza-
tional responsibility been respected and accepted by the G–ADW or the subsequent 
G–D  organizations,  there’s  a  strong  possibility  we  would  not  have  required  either 
this  hearing  or  expended  the  countless  tax  dollars  on  numerous  program  examina-
tions by a variety of auditing entities. 

Although  an  excellent  start  to  organizational  correction,  there  are  others  that  I 

think need to be instituted, In no particular order of importance: 

Oversight of the contractor must happen. We’re fooling ourselves if we actually 
believe  ‘‘insight’’  is  enough  and  the  contractor  will  self-monitor,  and  self-certify 
their  work  and  deliverables.  This  is  a  multi-billion  dollar  contract  and  we  owe 
it to the American public to ensure that every dollar is accounted for and spent 
wisely.  This  is  painfully  absent  with  the  existing  structure.  Until  Congress  is 
satisfied  with  the  program’s  corrective  progress,  routine  and  periodic  assess-
ments need to be instituted. 
Greater  accountability  is  needed  for  how  the  program  decisions  are  made  and 
what was the basis for the decisions. Real cost benefit analyses and trade stud-
ies  must  be  the  order  of  the  day.  Fabricated  analysis,  or  after  the  fact  studies 
which support a predisposed initiative must be eradicated. 
Real risk-based decisions with an active and managed database need to part of 
the  programs  normal  assessment  of  both  short-  and  long-term  risk  exposures. 
Mitigation  or  removal  of  risks  from  the  database  should  require  the  inde-
pendent verification by the Coast Guard’s technical authority. 
Accurate,  verifiable  and  repeatable  metrics  need  to  be  developed  and  utilized. 
The  continuation  of  the  System  Integrator  should  cease.  I  failed  to  see  the  jus-
tifiable return of the investment for these supposedly critical services. Through

careful  and  integrated  planning  with  the  current  Coast  Guard  organic  staffs, 
this integrator capability is well within the Coast Guard’s proven skill sets. 
The  current  contract  should  be  modified  or  restructured  to  enable  the  Coast 
Guard to work directly with the asset manufactures for construction. 
Asset  supported  logistics  and  supply  chain  management  should  be  managed  by 
Coast  Guard  organic  elements  as  one  singular  system  for  all  Deepwater  and 
non-Deepwater assets. To date the money directed to the ICGS advertised logis-
tic system has failed to produce any noticeable return on the sizable dollar and 
personal resource investment. 
Incorporate  the  exiting  G–S  cutter  certification  matrix  in  all  future  surface 
asset procurements. 

The IPT structure can work, but it takes a legitimate commitment and hard work 
by  all  parties  for  the  opportunity  to  really  collaborate.  IPT  leadership  and  chairs 
should  not  be  held  by  the  same  entities  we’re  trying  to  govern  and  manage.  It  just 
can’t  work.  If  IPTs  are  retained,  and  I  think  they  should,  our  contractors,  whoever 
they are need to be part of the IPT environment. 

In  closing,  I  greatly  appreciate  the  opportunity  this  Committee  has  offered  me 
today to testify before you. Concurrent with this oral testimony, I’ve provided a very 
lengthy and detailed written testimony for inclusion in the record. It further ampli-
fies  many  of  my  oral  comments  concerning  the  variety  of  Deepwater  subjects  that 
have brought me here. 

I’m  more  than  happy  and  very  willing  to  answer  any  and  all  of  your  questions 

to the best of my ability. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Captain Jarvis.

STATEMENT OF PHILIP A. TEEL, PRESIDENT, 

NORTHROP GRUMMAN SHIP SYSTEMS 

Mr. TEEL. Good afternoon, Chairperson Cantwell, Ranking Mem-
ber  Snowe,  and  the  distinguished  members  of  the  Committee  Sub-
committee, and thank you for the opportunity to appear before you 
to discuss Deepwater. 

I’m the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of ICGS, and the 
President of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. As I think you may 
know, Northrop Grumman Ship Systems has nearly 70 years of ex-
perience  designing,  constructing,  and  maintaining  ships  of  all 
types.  In  that  time,  Northrop  Grumman  Ship  Systems  Gulf  Coast 
operations has produced a total of 534 ships, and has built 24 per-
cent of the Navy’s current operational fleet. 

In  just  the  last  30  years,  we’ve  completed  15  new  vessel  designs 

for a diverse group of military and commercial seagoing ships. 

On behalf of Northrop Grumman, and all of the men and women 
working  in  support  of  this  program,  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the 
Subcommittee for their strong support of the Coast Guard, and the 
Deepwater Program. 

The  Program  has  been  subject  to  much  criticism,  recently.  My 
written  testimony  and  my  summary  of  remarks  are  intended  to 
provide  you  with  up-to-date  information  regarding  the  123′  patrol 
boat,  Fast  Response  Cutter,  and  the  design  and  service  life  of  the 
National Security Cutter. 

First,  let  me  address  the  patrol  boats.  The  110-foot  patrol  boats 
have  seen  extensive  duty  since  their  entry  in  the  service  some  20 
years  ago.  The  123′  conversion  was  intended  as  an  interim  meas-
ure, to extend the life and enhance the capabilities of an aging pa-
trol fleet, until new vessels were available to replace it. The conver-
sion work was performed under subcontract to Northrop Grumman 
by Bollinger shipyards, the original builder of the 110s.

The  conversion  project  underwent  an  extensive  design  and  re-
view  process  with  contractor  and  Coast  Guard  personnel.  The  due 
diligence was done. 

Six  months  after  delivery,  on  the  first  converted  vessel—the 
MATAGORDA—the  crew  discovered  buckling  in  her  hull  and  on 
her  deck.  This  discovery  occurred  immediately  following  a  high- 
speed  transit  in  rough  seas  to  avoid  Hurricane  Ivan.  The  Coast 
Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  analyzed  the  situation,  and  con-
cluded that a workmanship condition arising from the original 110′ 
construction—not  the  conversion—was  the  primary  cause  of  the 
buckling, and repairs were made. 
In  March  2005,  6  months  later,  another  converted  123′  experi-
enced  hull  deformation.  This  deformation  was  different  from  the 
first. Like the first, previous and subsequent analysis had not pre-
dicted  it.  At  this  time,  six  converted  vessels  had  been  delivered, 
and two were in the process. The Coast Guard and the contractors 
each  performed  additional,  more  detailed  structural  analyses.  De-
spite extensive efforts, these analyses have not replicated the expe-
riences. 

Additional  problems  have  arisen,  and  the  Coast  Guard  removed 
these  ships  from  service.  We’re  working  with  the  Coast  Guard  to 
re-review  all  data  and  analysis  to  isolate  the  cause,  or  causes,  of 
the problems. Once isolated, and design solutions defined, the path 
forward will be laid out with the Coast Guard. 

At  the  outset,  I  mentioned  the  110s  and  123s  would  eventually 
be replaced by the FRC, or Fast Response Cutter. In 2005, because 
of the problems with the 123′, the Coast Guard accelerated the de-
sign, and construction, of this cutter by 10 years. A worldwide mar-
ket survey of existing patrol craft determined that no existing craft 
would fulfill all FRC requirements. 

To address the full set of requirements, Northrop Grumman pro-
posed  a  new  design.  The  design  included  a  composite  hull  form, 
with  the  potential  to  save  a  billion  dollars  over  the  life  of  the  ves-
sel.  The  design  was  unique  for  patrol  boats.  This  is  driven  by  the 
need  to  stay  within  the  Coast  Guard’s  funding  limits,  yet  satisfy  a 
never-before-seen requirements-demand on a patrol boat. 

Contrary  to  some  accounts,  the  FRC  did  not  fail  model  testing. 
A  preliminary  test  was  conducted  improperly.  When  conducted 
properly, the FRC passed the test. Moreover, an independent anal-
ysis confirmed that the FRC design will meet performance require-
ments. 

To  meet  the  shortfall  in  patrol  boat  hours,  the  Coast  Guard  has 
pursued  selecting  an  existing,  proven  patrol  boat  that—with  lim-
ited  modifications—can  meet  its  highest  requirement  priorities. 
This is an interim measure, as this craft will not satisfy all require-
ments originally established for the FRC. Thus, the need for a dual 
path—FRC–B and FRC–A. 

Now,  let  me  turn  to  the  National  Security  Cutter.  The  NSC  1  is 
a  state-of-the-art,  frigate-sized  Naval  ship,  the  first  of  this  8  of 
class.  The  BERTHOLF  was  launched  in  September  of  2006,  and 
will be delivered in Fall of 2007. The second is under construction. 
With  regard  to  public  allegations  of  inadequate  ship  structure, 
the  NSC  1  is  designed  to  achieve  a  30-year  service  life.  The  NSC 
was  designed  using  the  same  structural  design  standards  as  suc-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

74 

cessfully  used  on  Navy  and  Coast  Guard  vessels  since  World  War 
II. Northrop Grumman has full confidence in the ability of the NSC 
to  perform  all  of  its  intended  missions.  The  issue  under  discussion 
with  the  Coast  Guard  deals  with  long-term  fatigue-life,  related  to 
various  assumptions  about  operating  conditions.  It  is  not  about 
whether the NSC, as designed, will be able to safely and effectively 
perform  its  mission  over  the  range  of  operational  environments. 
When  predicting  fatigue-life,  even  the  best  engineers  may  reach 
different conclusions. This is driven by the use of different assump-
tions about operating conditions. Coast Guard and Northrop Grum-
man technical experts are engaged in a meaningful dialogue which 
will lead to final agreement on fatigue structure. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  present  today,  and  I  look  for-

ward to your questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Teel follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PHILIP A. TEEL, PRESIDENT, 

NORTHROP GRUMMAN SHIP SYSTEMS (NGSS) 

Good afternoon Chairperson Cantwell, Ranking Member Snowe, and distinguished 

members of the Subcommittee. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  discuss  the  Deep-
water  Program.  As  you  know,  within  the  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  (ICGS) 
structure, a joint venture established by Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, 
Northrop  Grumman  Ship  Systems  (NGSS)  is  responsible  for  design,  construction 
and  support  of  all  three  classes  of  cutters;  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC),  the 
Offshore  Patrol  Cutter  (OPC),  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  (FRC),  as  well  as  the  110′ 
to  123′  converted  Island  Class  Patrol  Boats.  References  in  this  statement  to  ICGS 
or separately to Northrop Grumman or NGSS should be construed to mean the role 
of Northrop Grumman Ship Systems as part of ICGS. 

Northrop Grumman has nearly 70 years of experience designing, constructing and 
maintaining ships of all types. In that time, NGSS’s Gulf Coast operations has pro-
duced a total of 534 ships—351 ships at Ingalls and 183 at Avondale—and has built 
24  percent  of  the  Navy’s  current  fleet  of  276  vessels.  In  just  the  last  30  years,  we 
have  completed  15  new  designs  representing  a  diverse  group  of  military  and  com-
mercial  seagoing  ships:  LSD  49;  CG47,  DDG993,  LHD1,  LHD8,  LSD41,  LMSR, 
USCGC  HEALY  (Polar  Icebreaker),  2  Classes  of  T–AO  (KAISER  &  CIMARRON), 
Polar, NSC, LPD17, Saar5, and DDG1000. 

On  behalf  of  Northrop  Grumman  and  all  of  the  men  and  women  working  in  sup-
port  of  this  program,  I  would  like  to  thank  this  Subcommittee  for  your  strong  sup-
port  of  the  Coast  Guard,  and  of  the  Deepwater  Program.  We  look  forward  to  work-
ing  closely  with  you  and  the  Coast  Guard  to  ensure  the  success  of  this  important 
modernization.  The  following  statement  contains  information  that  I,  on  behalf  of 
Northrop  Grumman,  am  submitting  based  on  my  current  knowledge,  information 
and belief. 

Overall  Deepwater  Program  Management:  On  June  25,  2002,  the  Deepwater  Pro-
gram prime contract was awarded to ICGS. As program requirements have changed 
since  9/11,  the  Deepwater  prime  contract  has  been  amended  accordingly  to  accom-
modate the new requirements in support of national security. 

There  has  been  an  extraordinary  level  of  transparency  in  program  management 
and  execution  between  ICGS  and  the  Coast  Guard.  The  Coast  Guard  has  been  in-
volved in every aspect of the Program throughout its history. Each Deepwater asset 
undergoes  design  reviews  by  government  and  contractor  technical  experts  at  key 
points  in  the  design  life  cycle,  with  questions  and  issues  adjudicated  as  part  of  the 
review  process.  Personnel  from  the  Coast  Guard,  Northrop  Grumman,  Lockheed 
Martin,  various  subcontractors  and  ICGS  are  co-located  at  production  sites  around 
the country as well as in the Systems Integration Program Office in Arlington, Vir-
ginia.  Full  participation  by  the  Coast  Guard  is  built  into  every  level  and  function 
within the ICGS team. With respect to programmatic decisionmaking, all major ac-
quisition  decisions  are  made  by  the  Coast  Guard,  after  review  and  approval  by 
Coast  Guard  senior  leadership  through  a  series  of  cross-functional  government 
teams. These include reviews by subject matter experts from Engineering and Logis-
tics,  Electronics  &  Communications,  Human  Resources,  Intelligence,  and  the  Pro-
grams  &  Budget  Directorate  at  the  staff  and  flag  level.  Northrop  Grumman  and

ICGS do not make decisions in relation to what cutters and boats to buy—we make 
recommendations. The U.S. Coast Guard is the decisionmaking and contracting au-
thority,  and  has  retained  the  traditional  contract  management  functions,  including 
the  right  to  issue  unilateral  change  orders,  to  stop  or  terminate  work,  to  order  or 
not order assets and supplies, and to accept or reject the work. 

There  is  a  lot  of  interest  about  the  way  forward  for  Deepwater.  Leaders  within 
the highest levels of the Coast Guard, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin are 
committed and focused on the most important issues related to the 25-year, $24 bil-
lion acquisition program, including recent Coast Guard initiatives to strengthen pro-
gram  management  and  oversight—such  as  technical  authority  designation,  use  of 
independent (third-party) assessments, and consolidation of Coast Guard acquisition 
activities  under  one  directorate.  Objectives  to  achieve  the  way  forward  include:  (1) 
Capitalize on proven, first-article Deepwater successes; (2) Sustain momentum in re-
capitalizing  the  Coast  Guard  through  the  Deepwater  program;  and  (3)  Resolve  out-
standing  challenges  associated  with  some  projects  within  Deepwater.  The  senior 
leadership in each of our organizations is committed to meet regularly to review the 
progress of the program and provide executive level oversight at all times, with spe-
cific direction when warranted. 

Competition is also an important component of the Deepwater team’s effort to de-
liver  ‘‘best  value’’  to  the  Coast  Guard.  The  tenet  of  competition  within  the  ICGS 
Deepwater  program  plan  is  an  open  business  model  that  invites  participation  and 
competition  through  the  life  of  the  program.  Both  contractors  have  a  Contractor 
Purchasing  System  that  is  patterned  after  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations.  All 
Northrop  Grumman  purchases  over  $25K  are  individually  reviewed  for  compliance 
with  purchasing  guidelines,  and  the  purchasing  system  is  audited  (usually  every  3 
years)  by  the  Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency  (DCAA).  A  government-sponsored 
third-party  review  of  Deepwater  acquisition  practices  found  our  statistics  favorable 
compared  to  large  U.S.  Navy  procurement  programs.  In  addition,  competition  for 
subcontract  awards  is  encouraged  via  the  annual  Industry  and  Innovation  Days 
where  suppliers  and  vendors  have  an  opportunity  to  provide  input  on  new  or  im-
proved products. ICGS to date has placed orders with more than 600 suppliers rep-
resenting more than 41 states and maintains an active database of over 3,000 poten-
tial  suppliers  from  which  it  draws  to  host  annual  supplier  innovation  and  industry 
days. 

Patrol  Boats  are  small  naval  ships,  generally  designed  for  coastal  defense  duties, 
operated  by  a  nation’s  navy,  coast  guard  or  police  force  in  marine—‘‘blue  water’’— 
and  littoral  and  river—‘‘brown  water’’—environments.  They  are  commonly  found  in 
various  border  protection  roles,  including  anti-smuggling,  anti-piracy,  fisheries  pa-
trols,  immigration  law  enforcement  and  rescue  operations.  Patrol  boats  usually 
carry  a  single  artillery  gun  as  main  armament  with  a  variety  of  lighter  secondary 
armament  such  as  machine  guns,  and  are  diesel-powered,  with  speeds  generally  in 
the  25–30  knot  range.  The  above  definition  aptly  describes  the  49  ‘‘Island  Class’’ 
110-foot patrol boats and the 123-foot conversions under the original Deepwater pro-
posal. 

The Coast Guard’s current 110-foot patrol boats were built in the 1980s and early 
1990s by Bollinger Shipyards, Inc. These boats have seen extensive duty in support 
of the Coast Guard mission to save lives, interdict aliens and seize drugs. ICGS and 
its  teammate,  Halter  Bollinger  Joint  Venture  (HBJV),  proposed  to  convert  the  110- 
foot boats to 123-foot boats as an interim measure to improve the capability and ex-
tend  the  life  of  this  vessel  until  its  FRC  replacement  entered  operation  in  2018. 
ICGS proposed the conversion concept as the best means to provide the Coast Guard 
with  the  necessary  capability  to  continue  to  meet  its  mission  objectives  while  re-
maining  within  the  confines  of  program  funding  requirements.  Deepwater  competi-
tors were required to propose a ‘‘system of systems’’ solution that did not exceed the 
funding  limitation  of  $500  million  per  year.  With  new  assets  such  as  the  National 
Security Cutter (NSC), Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) and the Vertical Unmanned 
Air Vehicle (VUAV) being developed early in the program, it was not possible to de-
sign,  develop  and  construct  new  patrol  boats  at  program  inception  while  keeping 
within annual funding limitations. 
Bollinger had designed and built the original 110-foot boats and was very familiar 
with  their  construction.  Bollinger  was  awarded  a  contract  for  16  110′  Island  class 
boats  in  August  1984  and  another  contract  for  33  more  boats  in  1986.  The  design 
of the 110′ Island class was approximately 20 years old and was based on an exist-
ing patrol boat developed by a British firm, Vosper Thornycroft (U.K.) Ltd. The 110′ 
Island  Class  boats  were  commissioned  between  November  1985  and  1992.  Notably, 
after the first boats came into service, it was discovered that the 110s suffered from 
hull problems when operated in heavy seas. As a correctional measure, heavier bow

plating  was  added  to  hulls  17  through  49  during  construction  and  additional  stiff-
eners were retrofitted to earlier hulls. 
Under  the  proposed  Deepwater  conversion  plan,  HBJV  added  a  13-foot  extension 
to  the  110′,  which  accommodated  a  stern  ramp  for  the  launch  and  recovery  of  a 
small  boat,  used  primarily  to  support  boarding  and  rescue  operations.  In  addition, 
the  conversion  installed  an  improved  pilot  house,  enhanced  Command,  Control, 
Communications,  Computers  and  Intelligence,  Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance 
(C4ISR)  capabilities  and  tested,  identified  and  renewed  hull  plating  in  areas  where 
an  ultrasonic  thickness  inspection  indicated  that  the  existing  plating  was  deterio-
rated. 

At the time the proposal was submitted, some general knowledge about the condi-
tion of the 110s was available, and ICGS believed that replacement of the hull plat-
ing  would  adequately  address  and  offset  their  deteriorated  condition.  This  is  con-
sistent  with  the  findings  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  110′  WPB  Service  Life  Extension 
Board,  published  in  March  2002,  which  recommended  a  program  of  systematic  hull 
repairs, predominantly in documented problem areas, to address the hull deteriora-
tion problems that were impacting 110′ WPB operational availability. 

After being awarded the patrol boat conversion work, ICGS engaged in a rigorous 
design  process  that  included  extensive  reviews  with  all  stakeholders.  These  pro-
grammatic reviews included a Preliminary Design Review, a Critical Design Review 
and  a  Production  Readiness  Review  all  of  which  were  conducted  with  the  Coast 
Guard  before  the  actual  conversion  work  began.  Leading  up  to  each  of  these  re-
views,  the  evolving  design,  design  drawings  and  calculations  were  formally  pre-
sented  to  the  Coast  Guard  subject  matter  experts  in  increasing  detail  for  their  re-
view,  comment  and  approval.  During  this  series  of  reviews  I  am  not  aware  that 
structural,  buckling  or  deformation  concerns  were  raised  as  an  issue.  In  addition, 
during the conversion of the MATAGORDA, the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) 
examined  the  design  of  the  hull  extension  and  new  deckhouse  and  monitored  key 
elements of the work being performed. At the conclusion of the MATAGORDA work, 
they  issued  a  letter  of  approval  for  the  conversion  work  and  expressed  no  reserva-
tions with the feasibility of the conversion. 
The Performance Specification requirement calls for the 123′ to be capable of un-
restricted  operation  up  through  sea  state  3,  or  seas  averaging  less  than  four  feet. 
Operation  restrictions  are  imposed  beginning  at  sea  state  four,  or  seas  less  than 
eight  feet,  where  the  boats  are  to  be  able  to  sustain  limited  operations,  altering 
course or reducing speed as required to maintain a ride which does not damage the 
boat  or  its  machinery  or  overly  fatigue  the  crew.  The  123′  is  to  be  able  to  survive 
sea state 5, or seas averaging between eight and 13 feet, maneuvering as necessary 
to minimize damage or injury to the crew, and then be capable of returning to port 
under its own power once the seas have subsided. 

In  September  of  2004,  after  all  8  hulls  had  entered  the  conversion  program  and 
the first 4 hulls had been delivered, the MATAGORDA was forced to conduct a high 
speed  transit  to  avoid  Hurricane  Ivan.  This  operational  necessity  forced  the  Coast 
Guard  to  transit  in  a  sea  state  and  speed  where  the  cutter  was  operating  near  or 
above the design limits of the 123′ conversion. Upon arrival at their destination, the 
crew discovered buckling of the side shell and main deck on the starboard side near 
midships.  An  engineering  tiger  team  was  formed  consisting  of  Coast  Guard  and 
NGSS personnel. This team was dispatched to investigate the problem where it was 
discovered that the MATAGORDA had an inherent workmanship issue in the base-
line  110′  that  existed  prior  to  the  conversion  and  contributed  to  the  hull  buckling. 
Specifically,  a  hidden,  unwelded  aluminum  deck  stringer  was  discovered  imme-
diately  beneath  the  area  where  the  failure  occurred.  Other  boats  were  examined, 
and  this  unwelded  stringer  was  also  found  on  one  additional  hull  undergoing  con-
version.  When  modeled  using  finite  element  analysis,  the  stresses  in  the  panels 
which  failed  on  MATAGORDA  were  significantly  higher  than  the  stresses  shown 
when  the  model  was  run  with  this  stringer  intact.  Based  on  this  finding,  the  team 
believed this to be the primary cause of the buckling on MATAGORDA, and repairs 
were made accordingly. 
In addition, a reconstruction of the engineering analysis of the 123′ structure was 
conducted. Based on this, it was also discovered that an early calculation overstated 
the  strength  margin  for  the  boat.  A  revised  calculation  using  a  common,  agreed-to 
set  of  assumptions  by  the  engineering  team  showed  the  123′  would  still  meet  the 
required operations defined in the Performance Specification. 
In an effort to further improve the structural integrity on the 123′, three stiffener 
bands  were  installed;  one  at  the  upper  edge  of  the  side  shell,  one  below  this  one 
and  another  on  the  edge  of  the  main  deck  to  increase  the  overall  structural 
strength.  While  the  finite  element  analysis  and  conventional  calculations  both 
agreed that the original hull, with the stringer under the deck intact, should be suf-

ficient  throughout  the  operating  range  of  the  123′,  these  additional  stiffeners  were 
considered to provide an added margin of strength. 

In November 2004, ICGS received a contract modification that changed the arrival 
schedule of hulls 9–12 to TBD. Long-lead time material for four additional hulls had 
already  been  authorized  and  work  continued  on  the  3  remaining  hulls  in  process. 
By  March  2005,  6  of  the  123s  had  received  the  structural  upgrade  and  had  been 
delivered.  Certain  operational  restrictions  imposed  on  these  boats  by  the  Coast 
Guard following repairs to the MATAGORDA had been lifted. Then, during a transit 
from  Key  West  to  Savannah,  GA,  the  NUNIVAK  experienced  hull  deformation  in 
an  area  aft  of  the  new  reinforcing  straps.  This  deformation  occurred  in  a  different 
area from that of the MATAGORDA. Further, this was not an area which had indi-
cated  potential  for  high  stresses  under  any  conditions  modeled  in  the  earlier  finite 
element analysis. 
An outside engineering firm, Designers and Planners, was contracted by the Coast 
Guard  to  perform  a  more  detailed  finite  element  analysis  of  the  123′  hull,  which 
showed that the overall hull structure design was adequate under all expected oper-
ating conditions up to the worst operating condition modeled. The analyses were not 
able  to  replicate  the  deformation  seen  on  NUNIVAK.  A  more  detailed  look  at  spe-
cific  regions  on  the  hull  showed  an  area  with  high  potential  for  localized  buckling 
in  a  section  of  the  side  shell  where  the  original  110′  hull  had  been  constructed  of 
exceptionally thin four-pound plate. Despite this finding, no actual failures had ever 
been experienced in this area on 110′ or 123′ WPBs. As a precaution, this thin plate 
was  replaced  with  heavier  plating  on  those  cutters  undergoing  the  Post  Delivery 
Maintenance  Availability,  with  plans  to  eventually  upgrade  all  the  boats.  Last,  a 
metallurgical  analysis  of  the  deck  material  determined  that  the  particular  grade  of 
aluminum used on the 110s is prone to corrosion and cracking in elevated heat and 
marine conditions. 

In July 2005, then Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Collins’ written testimony 
before  Congress  outlined  the  two-fold  reason  for  stopping  the  conversion  process  as 
follows: ‘‘As the first eight 110′ to 123′ conversions were conducted, the Coast Guard 
found that the 110′ WPB hulls were in much worse condition than anticipated. This 
extended  the  conversion  timeline  and  would  have  increased  projected  costs  for  con-
versions after the first eight (the first eight were negotiated under a firm-fixed-price 
contract).  An  operational  analysis  of  the  123′  WPBs  also  identified  high  risks  in 
meeting mission needs, particularly in the post-9/11 environment.’’ 
To date the problems associated with the 123′ conversion include buckling or hull 
deformation and shaft and propeller alignment problems. In addition to the actions 
previously described, additional and substantial work has been (and continues to be) 
done. In addition to the repairs and reviews of structural calculations, we have con-
tinued  the  review  process  by  conducting  two  independent  finite  element  analyses, 
modeling  both  the  original  and  the  upgraded  hull,  and  we  completed  metallurgical 
testing  that  revealed  an  issue  in  the  main  deck  which  exists  on  both  the  123′  and 
across  the  legacy  110  fleet.  Extensive  strain  gage  testing  has  been  conducted  on  a 
123′  hull  to  validate  the  finite  element  model  and  to  identify  potential  problem 
areas  which  the  model  may  not  show.  The  parent  craft  designer,  Vosper 
Thornycroft,  has  been  engaged  to  evaluate  the  123′  hull  and  provide  recommenda-
tions.  Data  is  being  collected  on  shaft  alignment  and  maintenance  procedures  both 
during the conversion and since, so that the procedures for checking and correcting 
alignment can be validated for both the 110′ and the 123′. Elements of the 123′ de-
sign,  including  the  propellers  and  the  SRP  stern-launch  system  are  being  reexam-
ined and validated. 

We  are  committed  and  determined  to  identify  the  root  cause  of  the  structural 
problems.  Northrop  Grumman  and  Coast  Guard  engineers  are  currently  reviewing 
and  re-reviewing  all  available  data  on  the  110′  and  123′  patrol  boats  in  an  effort 
to  better  understand  the  cause  or  causes  of  both  hull  buckling  and  shaft  and  pro-
peller  alignment  problems.  Depending  on  the  outcome  of  that  analysis  the  possible 
outcomes range from removing the boats from service to effecting repairs with test-
ing  followed  by  placing  them  back  in  service.  Until  all  analyses  are  complete,  it  is 
premature to speculate on the final cause and the final way forward. 

Fast  Response  Cutter  Acceleration:  Before  Congress  in  July  2005,  then  Coast 
Guard  Commandant  Collins  testified:  ‘‘A  key  component  of  the  Deepwater  program 
is  the  replacement  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  110′  Island  Class  Patrol  Boat  (WPB)  fleet. 
The Island Class patrol boat is a Coast Guard multi-mission workhorse and is rap-
idly  approaching  the  end  of  its  serviceable  life.  Under  the  initial  IDS  proposal,  the 
49  110′  Island  Class  WPBs  were  scheduled  to  undergo  a  conversion  to  123′  WPBs 
by 2010 as a bridging strategy. The 123′ WPBs would then be replaced by the Fast 
Response  Cutter  (FRC)  starting  in  2018.  As  the  first  eight  110′  to  123′  conversions 
were  conducted,  the  Coast  Guard  found  that  the  110′  WPB  hulls  were  in  much

worse  condition  than  anticipated.  This  extended  the  conversion  timeline  and  would 
have  increased  projected  costs  for  conversions  after  the  first  eight  (the  first  eight 
were  negotiated  under  a  firm-fixed-price  contract).  An  operational  analysis  of  the 
123′  WPBs  also  identified  high  risks  in  meeting  mission  needs,  particularly  in  the 
post-9/11  environment.  The  Coast  Guard  recently  decided  to  stop  the  conversion 
project  following  the  first  eight  conversions.  Instead,  the  Coast  Guard  plans  to  ad-
vance  the  FRC  design  and  construction  by  10  years,  and  is  analyzing  alternatives 
methods for extending the life of the 110-foot fleet, as discussed above.’’ 

Consistent with this testimony, the Coast Guard accelerated FRC design and con-
struction  by  10  years.  The  expanded  set  of  post-9/11  requirements  produced  a  set 
of  required  capabilities  that  exceeded  the  traditional  patrol  boat  roles  filled  by  the 
110s  and  123s  and  other  similar  worldwide  patrol  boat  fleets.  A  market  study  was 
conducted  and  concluded  that  none  of  the  existing  similar  sized  patrol  boats  would 
meet  these  requirements.  A  series  of  business  case  analyses,  Total  Ownership  Cost 
(TOC)  studies  and  preliminary  design  efforts  showed  the  benefits  of  using  a  com-
posite hull form to meet this demanding set of requirements with a potential to save 
over  $1B  in  lifecycle  cost.  The  predominate  savings  came  from  the  superior  service 
life of composites. The Design to Cost constraints restricted the vessel length to 140 
feet. In order to accommodate the added capability and equipment required to meet 
the  post-9/11  mission  requirements  the  resultant  design  was  wider  for  its  length 
than historical and traditional patrol boat hull dimensions. Independent third-party 
analysis  by  John  J.  McMullen  and  Associates  (JJMA)  stated:  ‘‘The  review  team  be-
lieves that the FRC does appear to meet or is capable of meeting the requirements’’ 
and  acknowledges  that  ‘‘The  FRC  preliminary  design  represents  a  design  solution 
to  a  challenging  set  of  requirements.’’  Additionally,  I  would  like  to  point  out  that, 
contrary  to  what  was  reported  in  the  press,  the  FRC–A  did  not  fail  a  tank  test— 
a  preliminary  test  was  conducted  improperly.  When  this  test  conducted  properly, 
the FRC–A met all requirements, as is confirmed in the final model test report. 

The  Coast  Guard  made  the  decision  to  suspend  the  FRC–A  program,  as  the  all 
composite  design  is  now  called,  and  focus  on  a  parent  craft  solution  known  as  the 
FRC–B. This decision seeks to ensure a proven solution to a lesser requirements set. 
This  will  enable  the  additional  time  required  to  take  the  FRC–A  through  a  design 
spiral,  and  perform  trade  analyses  to  optimize  performance  to  cost  including  a  ro-
bust  operational  test  program  for  the  fully  capable  FRC.  The  Coast  Guard  is  also 
performing  an  additional  business  case  analysis  and  a  technology  readiness  assess-
ment to confirm viability of the composite approach. 

The  current  patrol  boat  acquisition  strategy  includes  two  paths:  FRC–A,  men-
tioned above and FRC–B. FRC–B will leverage existing patrol boat designs to serve 
as  a  bridging  strategy  while  the  fully  capable  FRC–A  is  undergoing  design  and  de-
velopment.  The  FRC–B  program  will  select  the  candidate  design  from  a  field  of 
worldwide  patrol  boat  providers  and  is  expected  to  enter  concept  design  later  this 
year. 

I  want  to  assure  the  Committee  that  Northrop  Grumman  will  continue  to  work 
with the Coast Guard in satisfying its patrol boat mission requirements throughout 
the life of the Deepwater Program. 

National  Security  Cutter  (NSC)  Structure  and  Cost  Growth:  Designed  to  replace 
aging  Hamilton  Class  High  Endurance  Cutters  (WHEC)  that  have  been  in  service 
over  40  years,  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC)  is  a  modern,  well-armed,  high- 
performance,  421-foot,  4,000-ton  frigate-sized  naval  ship,  with  manned  and  un-
manned  aircraft,  stern-launched  rigid  inflatable  boats  and  secure  communications 
facilities.  It  provides  the  Coast  Guard  with  enhanced  post-9/11  Homeland  security 
and  core  mission  capabilities  (drug  interdiction,  search  and  rescue,  economic  zone, 
and  fisheries  protection).  The  first  of  the  8  ship  class  (USCGC  BERTHOLF)  has 
been  launched  and  will  be  delivered  to  the  Coast  Guard  in  the  Fall  of  2007.  The 
second (USCGC WAESCHE) is also under construction and is scheduled for delivery 
to the Coast Guard in early 2009. 

With  regard  to  the  structure,  we  believe  the  NSC  meets  contract  requirements/ 
specifications.  The  NSC  design  uses  the  same  Data  Design  Sheet  (DDS)  standards 
used  in  structural  design  of  ships  since  WWII.  The  NSC  is  designed  to  meet  a  30- 
year  service  life  and  many  of  the  structural  items  raised  by  the  Coast  Guard  have 
been  addressed  and  were  incorporated  in  the  BERTHOLF  and  WAESCHE  (NSC  1 
and 2) prior to production. For example, upgraded steel, thicker steel, modifications 
to  Fashion  Plates  and  Re-entrant  Corners,  and  the  addition  of  2  longitudinal 
Hovgaard  bulkheads  to  provide  increased  stiffness  at  the  stern  were  incorporated 
into the design. 

With regard to NSC fatigue-life, even the best engineers will have different opin-
ions.  Analysis  has  been  performed  on  the  NSC  utilizing  a  relatively  new  model  de-
veloped  by  Naval  Surface  Warfare  Center,  Carderock  Division  (Carderock)  utilizing

two  different  approaches.  The  difference  in  the  two  approaches  is  whether  or  not 
the model is benchmarked by calculating the fatigue strength of proven ship designs 
with  similar  operational  characteristics  and  hull  form  that  has  been  at  sea  for  the 
desired  time.  This  enables  the  calculation  of  permissible  stress  levels  that  can  be 
applied  to  test  the  new  design.  The  results  of  these  two  analyses  have  generated 
a responsible dialog between the engineers which will lead to final agreement about 
enhancements to fatigue structure 

Northrop  Grumman  does  not  self-certify  compliance  with  the  structural  require-
ments in the contract. The BERTHOLF has and will undergo a comprehensive inter-
nal  and  external  certification  process.  The  American  Bureau  of  Shipbuilding  (ABS) 
certified 14 Systems Level drawings, including structural design drawings. ABS will 
also  certify  35  ship  systems  during  this  acceptance  process.  These  include:  Com-
mand  and  Control  Systems,  Propulsion  Plant,  Machinery  Monitoring  and  Control, 
Fuel  Systems,  Anchoring  Systems,  and  Steering  Systems.  During  the  design  proc-
ess,  there  will  be  a  total  of  46  independent  third-party  certifications  prior  to  or  as 
part of the USCGC BERTHOLF (NSC 1) delivery process. These include; Final Air-
craft  Facilities,  Flight  Deck  Status  and  Signaling,  Navigation  Systems,  Interior 
Communications Systems, Guns and Ammunition Weapons System Safety, DOD In-
formation Security and Accreditation, and TEMPEST. The U.S. Navy’s Board of In-
spection and Survey (INSURV) will conduct the Ship’s Acceptance Trials (AT) when 
the cutter gets underway later this year. 

Cost growth has also been mentioned in the media. Two elements have led to the 
majority  of  cost  growth  on  the  NSC—increased  post-9/11  requirements  and  the  im-
pact of Hurricane Katrina. The NSC that will be delivered to the Coast Guard this 
year is not the same ship that was first proposed in 1998. Today’s NSC has greatly 
improved  operational  capabilities  that  address  post-9/11  requirements  including 
Chemical,  Biological  and  Radiation  (CBR)  protection,  a  Sensitive  Compartmented 
Information Facility (SCIF) and more robust aviation installations so that the NSC, 
in  addition  to  its  normal  embarked  Coast  Guard  aviation  complement,  will  be  able 
to launch, recover and operate U.S. Navy, U.S. Government agency and partner na-
tion  manned  and  unmanned  rotary  wing  aircraft.  These  enhancements  have  added 
approximately 1,000 tons to the displacement, including a one-third increase in elec-
trical power systems, a tripling of air conditioning and ventilation capacity (HVAC), 
the  addition  of  25  antennas  and  a  26  percent  growth  in  the  size  of  the  berthing 
spaces. 

It is true that Katrina delayed the delivery of BERTHOLF by several months and 
added  cost  to  the  program.  Prior  to  Katrina,  BERTHOLF  was  the  best  ‘‘first  of 
class’’ ship in the 70 years that warships have been built in Pascagoula. Even taking 
into account Katrina, BERTHOLF continues to set new lead ship standards in qual-
ity  and  efficiency  with,  higher  performance  to  standards  than  both  the  first  or  sec-
ond  Arleigh  Burke  Class  (DDG  51)  destroyer  and  labor  utilization  measures  that 
routinely out-perform other programs in our shipyard. 

Much  of  what  has  been  done  on  the  NSC  program  is  being  transitioned  to  the 
rest  of  the  shipyard  to  other  construction  programs.  In  addition  to  the  specific  ac-
tions as they relate to the NSC program, we are investing $57.3 million of our own 
money  in  a  new  suite  of  management  tools  that  will  increase  our  visibility,  work 
sequencing capability, material and engineering modeling and capacity and resource 
planning. These tools will enable the reduction in the number of units we construct 
to build the NSC. Currently we build the vessel in 45 units and integrate these sub- 
assemblies  into  29  erection  lifts  on  the  ship.  The  new  tool  set  will  allow  us  to  plan 
and construct the vessel in less lifts, our target is 16, and as we know the less num-
ber  of  lifts  the  less  cost.  We  are  investing  in  our  human  capital,  process  improve-
ment, and our facilities to reduce the cost associated with building future ships. 

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  personally  update  you  on  the  progress  of  the 

Deepwater program. 

This is the end of my statement. I welcome your questions.

Dr.  MACKAY.  Good  afternoon,  Madam  Chair  and  Ranking  Mem-
ber  Snowe,  and  the  other  distinguished  members  of  the  Sub-
committee.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  explain  the  progress

being  achieved  on  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard’s  Integrated  Deepwater 
System  Program.  Speaking  for  the  men  and  women  of  Lockheed 
Martin, we’re proud to be associated with this critical program, and 
we  appreciate  very  much  the  continued  support  of  this  committee. 
Deepwater  is  modernizing  the  Coast  Guard  by  re-capitalizing 
aging  assets,  providing  new  assets,  and  expanding  capabilities. 
Lockheed  Martin  is  responsible  for  four  of  the  five  Deepwater  do-
mains. First, aviation, including the refurbishment and upgrades of 
existing  assets,  such  as  the  HH–65  helicopter,  and  the  HC–130H 
aircraft.  Production  of  new  assets,  such  as  the  HC–144  maritime 
patrol  aircraft,  missionized  C–130J  aircraft,  and  unmanned  aerial 
vehicles,  and  management  of  a  service  contract  covering  the  MH– 
68A  HITRON  helicopter.  Second,  Lockheed  Martin  is  responsible 
for C4ISR, the command and control network. Third, integrated lo-
gistics,  the  processes  and  systems  that  support  fielded  assets.  And 
fourth,  systems  engineering  and  integration,  the  process  to  make 
sure all Deepwater assets can work together as a system. 

We  work  within  the  Integrated  Coast  Guard  System’s  joint  ven-
ture  with  our  partner  Northrop  Grumman,  to  ensure  that  commu-
nications,  aviations,  and  logistics  systems  are  properly  coordinated 
with the program’s ships and ship systems. 

The purpose of ICGS is to provide for rapid allocation of work to 
the two companies, and to ensure collaboration and cooperation be-
tween  the  two  companies.  Today,  when  I  refer  to  ICGS  or  sepa-
rately to the role of Lockheed Martin, this means the role of Lock-
heed Martin within ICGS. 

Together,  Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman  are  using 
more than 600 suppliers in 42 states, plus the District of Columbia. 
We  maintain  an  active  database  of  more  than  3,000  potential  sup-
pliers.  In  assessing  the  program,  I  think  it’s  very  important  to 
maintain  emphasis  on  implementation  of  the  Deepwater  command 
and  control  network,  C4ISR,  a  very  awkward  acronym  for  Com-
mand  and  Control,  Computers,  Communications,  Intelligence,  Sur-
veillance  and  Reconnaissance.  This  is  the  network  glue  that  per-
mits  various  assets,  including  ships,  aircraft  and  shore  stations  to 
work together to achieve a common purpose. Modern civil, commer-
cial  and  military  systems  are  dependent  on  the  value  delivered  by 
the integrating power of the network. This is the core responsibility 
of Lockheed Martin. 

The  initial  system  deployment  has  already  resulted  in  measur-
able  progress  with  the  Coast  Guard’s  rescue,  enforcement  and 
interdiction  missions  on  the  high  seas.  Lockheed  Martin  is  accom-
plishing  a  high  rate  of  software  reuse,  as  well  as  system  com-
monality  and  integration  using  rigorous  application  of  proven  sys-
tem engineering processes and capabilities. 

Overall,  65  percent  of  Deepwater’s  software  is  reused  from  gov-
ernment  or  commercial  sources.  In  addition,  the  application  of  off- 
the-shelf  software  permits  Deepwater  to  take  advantage  of  the 
rapid  changes  in  the  commercial  marketplace  and  the  investments 
which commercial firms make in their best-of-class technologies. 

This  approach  is  the  key  to  commonality,  interoperability,  effi-
ciency,  and  effectiveness.  All  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  12  high-endur-
ance  and  27  medium-endurance  cutters  have  received  two  com-
mand  and  control  system  upgrades.  As  for  shore  sites,  there  are  a

81 

total  of  12  on  track  to  receive  upgrades,  2  communications  area 
master stations, 8 districts, one sector, and of course, headquarters. 
The first medium-range surveillance maritime patrol aircraft, the 
newly  designated  HC–144,  has  been  transferred  to  the  Coast 
Guard.  It  arrived  at  Elizabeth  City,  North  Carolina  on  December 
20,  2006,  and  I  am  happy  to  say  that  it  was  9  days  ahead  of  its 
contractual  schedule.  It’s  now  undergoing  missionization  that  will 
be completed in April. 

The second aircraft was accepted by the government on January 

25, 2007, and the third aircraft is in flight testing. 

We’re working to complete re-engining and upgrading of the HH– 
65  Charlie  helicopter,  with  65  of  95  helicopters  re-delivered  to  the 
Coast Guard to date. The HH–65C can fly faster, twice as far, and 
with twice the payload as its predecessor. 

The  service  contract  for  the  Helicopter  Interdiction  Tactical 
Squadron, or HITRON, based in Jacksonville, Florida, has been re-
newed for a fourth year. These 8 helicopters are equipped with air-
borne  Use-of-Force  capability,  and  have  had  significant  impact  on 
illicit drug interdictions. Last May, they celebrated their 100th suc-
cessful interdiction. 

All  of  our  designs  and  improvements  are  based  on  system  engi-
neering trade studies, analyses and technical considerations. In ad-
dition,  the  industry’s  performance  has  been  closely  supervised  by 
the  Coast  Guard  with  additional  oversight  by  the  Department  of 
Homeland  Security  and  the  Congress,  and  of  course,  the  Govern-
ment Accountability Office. Each of these multiple reviews has pro-
vided  constructive  recommendations,  as  requirements  continue  to 
evolve. 

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  present,  and  to  explain 
the  progress  we  are  achieving  on  the  Deepwater  program.  I  look 
forward to answering your questions. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  LEO S.  MACKAY,  VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL 
MANAGER,  COAST GUARD SYSTEMS,  LOCKHEED MARTIN MARITIME SYSTEMS 
AND SENSORS 
Good  Morning,  Madam  Chairperson  and  distinguished  members  of  the  Sub-

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  explain  the  progress  we  are  achieving  on  the 
U.S.  Coast  Guard’s  Integrated  Deepwater  System  program.  Speaking  for  the  men 
and women of Lockheed Martin, we are very proud to be associated with this critical 
program.  The  Coast  Guard  is  a  key  national  asset  for  assuring  the  security  and 
safety of our country’s maritime transportation system. Each of us, in accomplishing 
our  daily  tasks  on  the  program,  has  a  deep  sense  of  the  importance  of  achieving 
the very best for the Coast Guard and our Nation. 
Overview 

The  Integrated  Deepwater  System  program  is  delivering  both  new  and  upgraded 
fixed-wing  and  rotary-wing  aircraft;  new  communications  systems  that  are  making 
a  significant  contribution  to  improved  mission  performance;  and,  the  logistics  sys-
tems  necessary  to  support  fielded  assets.  We  understand  the  Integrated  Deepwater 
System will continue to evolve. To meet this ongoing challenge, Lockheed Martin is 
applying  a  disciplined  system  engineering  approach  to  the  program.  This  will  con-
tinue to be vital for achieving more robust capabilities given fiscal realities—a one- 
asset-at-a-time recapitalization approach would be unaffordable. Lockheed Martin is 
committed  to  providing  our  best  talent  and  capabilities  for  supporting  the  Coast 
Guard. 

Lockheed  Martin  is  primarily  responsible  for  four  Deepwater  domains:  System 
Engineering  and  Integration,  C4ISR  (the  command  and  control  network),  Logistics

and Aviation (refurbishment of existing assets and production of new assets). Lock-
heed Martin’s goal is the full application of system engineering methodologies to es-
tablish the best mix of assets and introduction of new capabilities as well as imple-
mentation  of  the  associated  logistics  systems.  Most  important  is  maintaining  em-
phasis  on  the  implementation  of  the  Deepwater  system-wide  command  and  control 
network.  C4ISR  (Command  and  Control,  Computers,  Communications,  Intelligence, 
Surveillance and Reconnaissance) is the network ‘‘glue’’ that permits various assets 
including ships, aircraft and shore stations to work together to more effectively and 
efficiently  achieve  a  common  purpose.  Thus,  the  C4ISR  domain  is  of  particular  im-
portance  as  most  modern  civil,  commercial  and  military  systems  are  dependent  on 
the value delivered by the integrating power of the network. 
Key Achievements 

We are making good progress and are delivering significant new and upgraded ca-
pabilities. At the same time, we recognize the system level effects of networking are 
essential to achieving the level of mission performance needed by the Coast Guard. 
Lockheed  Martin  is  accomplishing  high  rates  of  software  reuse  as  well  as  system 
commonality and integration by the rigorous application of proven system engineer-
ing processes and capabilities. In addition, we are managing implementation of sup-
port  systems  for  all  Deepwater  program  domains.  The  Lockheed  Martin  team  is 
working closely with our Integrated Coast Guard Systems, LLC (ICGS) joint venture 
partner,  Northrop  Grumman,  to  ensure  that  electronic  equipment  developed  and 
produced  under  the  cognizance  of  the  C4ISR  domain  is  appropriately  configured  for 
installation on the ships. 

Every one of the Coast Guard’s 12 high-endurance and 27 medium-endurance cut-
ters  have  received  not  one  but  two  command  and  control  system  upgrades—giving 
the  fleet  markedly  improved  capability  to  seize  drugs,  interdict  migrants  and  save 
lives. As for shore sites, there are a total of 12 on contract: two Communication Area 
Master  Stations,  eight  Districts,  one  Sector  and  Headquarters.  Use  and  reuse  of 
commercial-off-the-shelf,  government-off-the-shelf  and  fielded  maritime  systems  are 
being  maximized  for  commonality  and  interoperability.  The  application  of  off-the- 
shelf  software  permits  Deepwater  to  take  advantage  of  the  rapid  changes  in  the 
commercial marketplace and the investments which commercial firms make in their 
best of class technologies. This will facilitate Coast Guard interoperability with civil 
and international systems, a key consideration given their mission mix. 

The  National  Security  Cutter  is  using  75  percent  of  the  U.S.  Navy’s  Open  Archi-
tecture Command and Decision System. The Command and Control System for Mar-
itime  Patrol  Aircraft  employs  more  than  50  percent  of  the  functionality  of  the 
Navy’s  P–3  Anti-Surface  Warfare  Improvement  Program.  The  Operations  Center 
consoles on the National Security Cutter utilize more than 70 percent of the design 
of the Navy’s UYQ–70 display systems. Use and reuse of available software and sys-
tems is the key to commonality. In addition, this approach takes greatest advantage 
of  the  work  undertaken  with  the  Navy  to  establish  the  best  Human  System  Inter-
face  including  workspace  ergonomics,  viewing  characteristics,  input  devices  and 
overall system architecture. 

The  first  medium-range  surveillance  maritime  patrol  aircraft,  the  newly  des-
ignated  HC–144,  has  been  transferred  to  the  Coast  Guard.  It  arrived  at  Elizabeth 
City,  NC,  on  December  20,  2006  and  is  now  undergoing  missionization  work  that 
will  be  completed  in  April.  The  second  aircraft  was  accepted  by  the  government  on 
January 25, 2007 and the third aircraft is in flight testing. The second aircraft will 
now  be  delivered  to  Elizabeth  City  for  missionization  and  two  crews  are  already  in 
training.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  working  to  complete  re-engining  and  upgrading 
of  HH–65  helicopters  with  65  of  95  helicopters  delivered  to  date.  This  project  was 
part of the original Deepwater program plan. However, at the direction of the Coast 
Guard, it was rapidly accelerated due to safety of flight issues. Lockheed Martin and 
American  Eurocopter  working  with  the  Coast  Guard  Aircraft  Repair  and  Supply 
Center  are  now  producing  upgraded  helicopters  (‘‘Charlies’’)  that  can  fly  faster, 
twice as far and with twice the payload. 

Six  long-range  surveillance  C–130J  aircraft  are  undergoing  missionization  and 
will be delivered within 15 months after receipt of the contract with fully interoper-
able command, control and communications systems. The first aircraft was inducted 
for missionization at Greenville, SC, on December 19, 2006. In addition, the service 
contract for the Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON) based in Jack-
sonville, FL, has been renewed for a fifth year. These eight MH–68A helicopters are 
equipped  with  airborne  Use-of-Force  and  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  illicit 
drug interdictions. The squadron celebrated its 100th interdiction last May. 

Industry’s performance has been closely supervised by the Coast Guard with addi-
tional  oversight  from  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  the  Congress  and  the

Government  Accountability  Office.  Each  of  the  multiple  reviews  has  provided  con-
structive  recommendations  as  requirements  and  funding  levels  continue  to  evolve. 
The  results  so  far  indicate  that  Deepwater  has  made  a  dramatic  difference  in  the 
effectiveness  of  the  Coast  Guard  with  regard  to  the  numbers  of  drug  seizures,  mi-
grant  interdictions  and  lives  saved.  Coast  Guard  statistics  show  double-  and  triple- 
digit percent improvements as Deepwater assets and upgrades enter the fleet. 
Strategic Context of ICGS 

The Deepwater program is modernizing the Coast Guard by providing new assets 
and  expanding  capabilities  in  aviation,  ships,  shore  stations,  logistics,  and  com-
mand,  control  and  communications  systems.  The  ICGS  joint  venture  between  Lock-
heed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman  was  designed  as  a  low  overhead  contracting 
vehicle. Its purpose is to provide for rapid parsing of work between the two partners 
while at the same time achieving close collaboration and cooperation. It is important 
to note what it is not. The ICGS joint venture is not a replacement for Coast Guard 
decisionmaking. All designs and improvements are based on trade studies, analyses, 
and  technical  considerations.  But  make  no  question  about  it—the  Coast  Guard  is 
the decisionmaker and contracting authority and all major acquisition decisions are 
reviewed  and  approved  by  Coast  Guard  senior  leadership.  ICGS  utilizes  the  depth 
of capabilities and experience of its partners to provide solutions in accordance with 
Coast  Guard  requirements.  The  joint  venture  partners  are  utilizing  more  than  600 
suppliers  in  42  states  plus  the  District  of  Columbia.  In  addition,  ICGS  maintains 
an active database of more than 3,000 supplier-product applications. 

The  Deepwater  program  began  in  1997  as  competing  teams  were  established  to 
develop  proposed  solutions  for  bidding  the  program.  In  fact,  proposals  were  sub-
mitted  to  the  government  less  than  2  weeks  after  9/11.  Since  then,  the  ICGS  team 
was  awarded  the  Deepwater  program  and  successfully  accomplished  a  number  of 
changes.  Most  significant  were  those  resulting  from  the  dramatically  increased 
Coast Guard operating tempo in the post-9/11 environment. This means that legacy 
equipment  began  to  wear  out  far  more  rapidly  than  had  been  projected.  A  good  ex-
ample  is  the  HH–65  helicopters  mentioned  above.  While  the  ICGS  team’s  approach 
always  included  re-engining  of  this  equipment,  the  original  plan  was  to  be  accom-
plished  over  a  longer  time  period.  Nevertheless  the  team  was  able  to  process  the 
urgent  requirement  for  re-engining  and  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  fleet  have  al-
ready  been  upgraded  and  returned  to  service.  It  is  this  inherent  flexibility  of  the 
ICGS joint venture stemming from the deep capabilities of its partners that will fa-
cilitate  our  working  with  the  new  acquisition  organization  planned  by  the  Coast 
Guard. 
The Way Ahead 

Our  overarching  goal  is  to  provide  more  capability  to  the  fleet,  sooner.  We  are 
dedicated  to  analyzing  and  recommending  approaches  for  maximizing  the  value  de-
livered  to  the  Coast  Guard,  in  accordance  with  the  customer’s  view  of  value,  not 
that  of  industry.  This  requires  the  best  talent  from  each  corporation.  ICGS  works 
closely  with  Coast  Guard  personnel  to  assure  constant  communications  and  im-
proved working relationships. The strategic policy changes that have occurred since 
9/11  must  be  factored  into  problem  solving.  The  Coast  Guard  and  the  Department 
of  Homeland  Security  have  needs  that  can  be  satisfied  by  the  Deepwater  program 
and  its  approach  to  value  delivery.  The  way  forward  will  be  difficult,  but  given  the 
capabilities  of  the  participants  and  the  strategic  imperative  to  better  outfit  our 
Coast  Guard  so  the  safety  and  security  of  our  Nation  is  improved,  the  Deepwater 
program is eminently achievable. 

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  present  and  explain  the  progress  we  are 
achieving  on  the  Deepwater  program,  I  look  forward  to  answering  your  questions. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Mackay,  and  thank  you  to 

each of the panelists. 

Captain Jarvis, I would like to start with you. I’m concerned that 
the Coast Guard reinterpreted the performance of the National Se-
curity  Cutters—I’m  sure  we  could  have  a  long  conversation  about 
that, given how much has been written in the various reports about 
that  and  the  testimony  here  today—but,  I’m  concerned  that  this 
also  occurred  in  the  123′  conversion.  Do  you  think  that  that’s  a 
problem?  Or  were  any  of  the  other  assets  where  this  issue  of  re- 
interpreting  what  the  performance  requirements  are  was  problem-

atic across, not just one vessel, but across several of the new prod-
ucts that the Coast Guard was seeking? 

Captain JARVIS. I understand the question, Senator. 
This  problem  did  exist.  And  it’s  somewhat  suspect  because  the 
construct of the contract itself. In the fact, with the exception of the 
NSC,  which  is  the  only  asset  that  really  had  any  level  of  refined 
performance  requirements,  the  rest  of  them  were  up  to  the  three 
industry teams to give us their proposals. 

One  of  the  contract  deliverables  with  those  proposals  was  their 
generated  performance  specification  for  that  particular  asset.  And 
we’ll start with the 123′. 
When  the  123′  was  included  in  the  package,  there  was  a  pro-
posed performance specification that was going to be with the 123′. 
That  proposed  performance  specification  would  have  been  the  only 
document we had to try and pin the contractor down to the specific 
performance of that asset. 
Through  the  maturity  of  the  123′  when  it  first  got  to  Bollinger, 
the  performance  specification  kept  on  getting  modified,  and  modi-
fied  and  modified,  to  the  point  the  ‘‘as  accepted’’  performance  spec 
for  the  123′—and  I  think  that’s  what  the  title  of  it  is—the  ‘‘as  de-
livered’’  performance  spec,  doesn’t  look  exactly  like  the  proposed 
performance  spec  that  did  come  with  the  contract.  So,  it  did 
change. 
So, what does that mean? It means that, by the contract, the con-
tractor  did,  in  fact,  give  us  the  performance  for  the  123′,  because 
the  performance  spec  was  written  to  what  the  123′  could  do,  in-
stead  of  the  other  way  around.  It  did  happen.  And,  it’s  not  just  in 
the surface side. 

Senator CANTWELL. Well, given that there are cost overruns now 
on  several  of  these  vessel  plans,  do  you  think  this  committee 
should be looking at recouping some of these costs to the taxpayer? 
Given  that—as  I’ve  indicated—I  think  we’re  talking  about  hun-
dreds of millions of dollars, or as Senator Kerry projected—and I’m 
assuming he’s talking about bills yet to be received—billions of dol-
lars for ships that either have had to be pulled, or never are going 
to  be  deployed,  or  have  structural  challenges  to  their  current  de-
ployment. 

Captain JARVIS. Senator, I didn’t have personal knowledge of ex-
actly  how  the  money  flowed  in  and  out  of  the  Program.  I  had  a 
hard  enough  time  just  trying  to  find  out  how  the  engineering  was 
working.  But,  as  a  taxpayer,  I  would  sure  be  asking  those  ques-
tions.  If  so  much  money  was  devoted  to  these  assets,  and  they’re 
not working, shouldn’t there be some sort of a recoup coming back? 
So, as a taxpayer, I would clearly ask that question, yes. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Do  you  think  the  Coast  Guard,  through  a 
more  traditional  process  of  procurement  that  has  been  followed  in 
the past, could do a better job in delivering these assets? 

Captain JARVIS. Senator, I think I will agree very much with Ad-
miral Allen, in the fact that our past procurements were relatively 
simple, in the fact that they were one asset, or a fleet of one asset. 
This  one  was  definitely  more  complex.  But,  I  do  believe,  that  the 
traditional way of procuring assets, if we use the traditional acqui-
sition  manual  model  for  what  I  always  call  that,  healthy  tension 
between  the  various  directors,  would  have  had  significantly  more

power  given  to  the  technical  authority,  that  being  the  G–S  engi-
neers, to ensure we may not be here today. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Mr.  Teel,  you  say  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  design—I  don’t—is 
OK, I guess. That it needs four engines just to operate, but I know 
there  has  been  some  internal  discussion  about  the  design  and  the 
fact  that  it  is  52  percent  heavier  than  the  normal  design.  So,  I 
want both of you, actually, Captain Jarvis and Mr. Teel to respond 
to that, do you think that’s meeting the Coast Guard’s needs? 

Mr.  TEEL.  Madam  Chair,  as  I  said  in  my  verbal  testimony,  in 
order to achieve the full set of requirements that we were respond-
ing to for the Coast Guard, the result was what truly is a non-tra-
ditional  patrol  boat  design.  Because  of  the  requirements,  and  the 
requirements  were  constrained  also  by  the  cost,  because  we  were 
operating  under  a  design-to-cost  cap,  which  constrained  the  length 
of  the  vessel.  So,  it  resulted  in  a  vessel  that  was  significantly  out 
of the design lanes of traditional patrol boats. No patrol boat in the 
world—we  did  a  survey  of  that,  as  did  the  Coast  Guard—was  able 
to  accommodate  all  of  those  requirements,  and  the  design  was 
unique. 

That design was evaluated independently as one that would sat-
isfy the total set of requirements, albeit, it was heavier and did re-
quire additional engines. 

on that? 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Captain  Jarvis,  do  you  have  any  comments 

Captain  JARVIS.  I’d  agree  the  fact  that  the  design  for  the  FRC 
was,  in  fact,  much  heavier  than  we  were  expecting,  and  was  well 
outside  of  parametric  equations  that  naval  engineers  use  to  make 
determinations as far as hull resistance and propulsion. 

We affectionately called the FRC design a ‘‘brick’’ in the fact that, 
even  a  brick—if  you  put  enough  horsepower  on  it—you  can  make 
it  plane  across  the  water  at  35  knots.  This  design  would  meet  the 
performance  specification,  that  was  never  our  contention.  It  would 
meet  the  performance  specification.  But  there  were  other  aspects 
that  we,  as  the  naval  engineers,  always  utilized  when  we  were 
looking  at  the  proposal.  The  long-term  maintenance  cost—four  en-
gines  on  a  patrol  boat  is  a  rather  significant  maintenance  require-
ment  for  us  long-term.  There  were  much  more  elegant  ways  of 
achieving  the  predominance  of  the  requirements  than  the  much 
heavier  FRC  design  with  four  engines.  So,  we  never  contended  it 
wouldn’t  meet  the  performance.  It’s  just  that  we  didn’t  think  that 
it was the best way of doing it. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Senator Snowe, did you have some questions? 
Senator SNOWE. Yes, thank you. 
Thank  you,  Captain  Jarvis  for  your  willingness  to  come  forward 
and  give  us  the  breadth  and  depth  of  the  picture  in  the  Coast 
Guard  in  this  monumental  failure.  I  mean,  it’s  just  replete  with 
failures, and I know that some of this may be able to be explained 
somewhere,  but  obviously  something  went  terribly  wrong  within 
the system, and we’ve got to learn from it, understand it, deal with 
it realistically and see how we can go forward. 

But first and foremost, it’s going to be critical to understand the 
nature of what went wrong, and how we tackle modifying the prob-

lems  that  face  us  at  a  time  in  which  the  men  and  women  depend 
on these assets for the future. Given the fact that the Coast Guard 
is  the  third  oldest  naval  fleet  in  the  world.  And  here  we  are  today 
dealing  with  major  structural  deficiencies  with  this  re-capitaliza-
tion program. 

At  any  time,  Captain  Jarvis,  when  there  was  a  disagreement 
with  systems  integrators  and  engineers  such  as  yourself,  did  the 
Coast  Guard  ever  come  to  you,  take  up  your  suggestions  with  re-
spect to the concerns that you had? I mean, where did they decide 
between  the  disagreements  that  might  exist  within  this  program, 
and  obviously  it  did  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time,  obviously  they 
were aware of it. Did they ever follow through on any of your con-
cerns and recommendations, and how it should be done differently, 
where the deficiencies manifested themselves? 

Captain  JARVIS.  Senator,  the  answer  to  your  question  is  very 
simple,  because  you  asked  for  an  all-inclusive  answer.  And,  I’m 
sure somewhere in those 7 years I was engaged with the program, 
the  Deepwater  Program  listened  to  something  I  said.  Predomi-
nantly,  they  didn’t.  When  we  would  raise  the  issues  in  that  Inte-
grated  Process  Team  environment,  where  collaboration  was  sup-
posed to be the way of doing business, more often than not, the en-
gineering concerns that the G–S Director and engineers brought up 
were  discussed,  maybe  documented  and  whatever  the  mechanism 
was  for  deciding  how  the  outcome  was  going  to  be,  it  typically— 
it typically—did not fall in alignment with what our concerns were. 
But,  to  answer  your  specific  question,  Senator,  I’m  sure  that 
there  were  some  places,  somewhere  along  that  timeline  where  one 
of the IPTs that we were engaged with, at least, listened to me. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  you’ve  obviously  given  some  very  sub-
stantive,  in-depth  testimony  over  your  service  during  this  Deep-
water  acquisition  process,  and  it’s  regrettable  to  me  that  they 
didn’t follow up on some of the serious concerns that you raised at 
a  time  in  which  many  of  these  problems  might  have  been  averted. 
Do you think we would not be in this situation today, had they fol-
lowed  up  on  some  of  these  serious  questions?  What  do  you  think 
the  interest  was?  Just  to  keep  it  on  schedule,  irrespective  of  the 
performance failures? 

Captain  JARVIS.  Senator,  the  coined  phrase  we  heard  most  often 

was ‘‘ruthless execution of the schedule.’’ 

Senator  SNOWE.  We  heard  that  consistently  before  this  com-

mittee. 

Captain JARVIS. And we were given a healthy dose of that every 
day. To answer your specific question, would we be here if we were 
listened to more? I suspect not. 

I’m  a  disciple  of  what’s  called  ‘‘root  cause  analysis  in  engineer-
ing.’’  When  you  have  a  problem,  you  go  all  the  way  down  to  its 
most  basic,  fundamental  problems  to  make  sure  it  doesn’t  happen 
again.  The  most  common  problem  that  occurred  was  almost  every-
thing that we’re talking about today is the fact that the G–S engi-
neers were not given their ability to be the technical authority that 
they  were  in  traditional  contracts.  Admiral  Allen  has  seen  that  as 
a  very  significant  problem,  and  I  commend  his  efforts  to  making 
sure  that  that  was  his  first  overt  change  that  should  have  been 
done years ago.

So,  had  that  been  in  place  when  this  contract  was  first  put  in 

place, I don’t think we’d be here. 

Senator SNOWE. They sort of performed an advisory role, at best? 
Captain  JARVIS.  Senator,  we  were  less  than  an  advisory  role. 
Most people considered us as a necessary nuisance. We were there 
because  we  were  a  member  of  the  IPT.  They  listened  to  us,  most 
of  our  comments  were,  the  favorite  phrase  was  ‘‘adjudicated,’’  that 
doesn’t  mean  that  they  were  resolved,  it  means  most  of  the  times 
we were just noted in the discussion. We had a very, very difficult 
time trying to make anybody respect, honor and listen to what our 
concerns were. And the fact that we’re here today is, I think, testa-
ment that maybe we should have done it better. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Mr.  Teel,  and  Dr.  Mackay,  I  don’t  know  who  to 
ask this question of—the contract is self-certified? Is that standard 
procedure? To allow contractors to self-certify? 

Dr. MACKAY. Senator, I can talk about, in the aviation and C4ISR 
world,  there  are  a  number  of  outside  certification  agencies.  For 
C4ISR,  the  Coast  Guard  has  liaisoned  with  SPAWAR,  which  is  a 
Navy  organization,  and  in  aviation,  the  new  HC–144,  we  had  an 
international  certification  in  the  country  in  which  it  was  manufac-
tured,  it  was  provided  by  INTA,  which  is  a  Spanish  aviation  au-
thority. And then, as it comes back here, the Coast Guard, I think, 
collaborates  with  NAVAIR.  So,  there  are  a  number  of  independent 
government certification and accreditation agencies that we’re sub-
ject to in aviation and C4ISR. I would ask Mr. Teel if—— 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  guess,  the  idea  here  is  that  the  Coast 
Guard  is  allowing  you  to  certify  your  own  ship  designs.  Where  is 
the independent analysis? 

Mr.  TEEL.  Senator,  I’m  not  sure  where  the  actual  allegation 
about us self-certifying comes from. I recognize it was identified in 
the  IG  report.  We,  in  fact,  go  through  a  design  process  and—in 
many cases, depending on what has been selected in the contract— 
ABS  does  certification  of  several  elements  of  the  ship  design.  In 
fact,  the  designs  themselves,  the  drawings  are  reviewed  by  the 
Coast  Guard,  so  I’m  unclear  about  what’s  meant  by  the  allegation 
that  we  self-certify.  The  actual  ship  itself  will  be  tested  by  the 
INSURV,  Board  of  INSURV  by  the  U.S.  Navy,  that’s  who  will  do 
the  final  testing,  and  recommending  of  the  acceptance  of  the  ship, 
so  I’m  unclear  about  what  is  meant  by  us  doing  self-certification, 
because the process is reviewed along the way. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  the  Commandant,  and  the  Inspector  Gen-

eral indicated that. 

Mr.  TEEL.  Senator,  I’ve  told  you  what  I  know  and  understand 

about the way the contract’s structured. 

Senator  SNOWE.  I  just  want  to  know.  Obviously,  they  indicated 
that,  and  so  I  think  that  that’s  probably  the  case,  in  terms  of  the 
practice. 

Mr.  TEEL.  Well,  what  we  can  do  is  submit  to  you  the  way  the 
contract—as  further  data—how  the  contract  is  structured  in  the 
way the various elements are approved and certified. 

Senator  SNOWE.  I  think  the  key  here  is  that  there  is  not  inde-
pendent  analysis,  I  mean,  that’s  the  problem.  Do  you  acknowledge 
there  are  any  problems  in  the  contract,  from  the  standpoint  of  the 
government, I mean, the Coast Guard? Do you recognize any prob-

lems with the National Security Cutter deficiencies? Any problems 
at all? Did you raise problems with the Coast Guard? 

Mr. TEEL. Well, we certainly recognize that there is a significant 
issue  that’s  under  review  about  the  fatigue-life  of  the  ship,  yes, 
ma’am. I do. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Right,  and  did  you  acknowledge  it  at  the  time, 

at any point during the construction of the ship? 

Mr. TEEL. All during the design of the ship, there was interaction 
with  the  Coast  Guard  on  the  design.  As  Captain  Jarvis  said,  our 
role  was  to  conduct  the  design  and  then  provide  that  information 
to  the  Coast  Guard.  It  went  through  the  IPT  processes,  as  de-
scribed. That’s not unusual, the dynamic tension was there. I think 
the  question  at  issue  was  whether  or  not  the  way  that  we  pro-
ceeded was fully accepted by all elements of the Coast Guard. They 
were  accepted  in  the  design  reviews,  as  it  was  provided  to  us.  We 
were  not  privy  to  what  took  place  in  terms  of  how  the  decisions 
were made, about what we recommended in the path that we were 
taking. 

Senator  SNOWE.  No,  I  understand  that.  The  Coast  Guard  obvi-
ously made some serious mistakes in this regard. Without question, 
given  the  whole  structure.  So,  I  had  no  doubt  that  you  would  say 
that.  I  think  the  point  is,  here,  where  does  the  responsibility  lie, 
in  the  final  analysis?  I  mean,  you’ve  got  some  monumental  prob-
lems, whether you agree or disagree, but we are where we are. The 
Fast  Response  Cutter—they  had  to  look  for  an  interim  solution  to 
this  problem.  Even  the  Commandant  said  in  his  testimony  today, 
it’s unacceptable. 

So, we have that problem. And we have a problem with the NSC, 
we’ve  got  to  figure  out  not  only  the  modifications,  whether  or  not 
they  will  address  the  problems,  but  we  don’t  even  know  what  the 
cost  will  entail.  And  as  I  understand  it,  and  I  disagree  with  it, 
we’re  going  to  bear  the  cost.  The  Federal  Government  is  going  to 
have to bear the cost of these substantial modifications. So, the fact 
is,  there  wasn’t  any  built-in  incentive,  even  on  your  part,  to  bring 
these problems to the Coast Guard’s attention. If it was a so-called 
‘‘cost-plus  contract,’’  then  there’s  no  incentive  to  correct  those  defi-
ciencies at the point in time, and to recognize them and to halt the 
construction. 

Obviously, there was a problem, because no one brought it to our 
attention.  I  mean,  that’s  the  point  here.  And,  it  just  went  on  as 
Captain  Jarvis  said,  that  ruthless  execution.  But  that  shouldn’t 
mean the expense of the cost of the structural failures that are in-
herent  in  the  design  at  this  point,  that  we  now  have  to  grapple 
with, and that’s the point here. 

We’re  facing  a  serious  situation,  and  I  just  wonder  with  all  that 
has been said here today, the Inspector General’s report, what Cap-
tain Jarvis said, some of the issues—do you acknowledge, do either 
of  you  acknowledge  that  there  were  problems  with  this  contract? 
With the NSC? Do you agree that there were any problems? 

Mr.  TEEL.  Senator,  sorry,  as  I  said  in  my  written  testimony  and 
tried  to  summarize  in  the  verbal—the  National  Security  Cutter 
was designed to the same standards that ships have been designed 
to since World War II.

Having  said  that,  we  recognize  that  any  design  process  has 
issues that need to be dealt with along the way. Those issues have 
been  dealt  with,  with  the  exception  of  the  fatigue-life  prediction 
issues.  And,  again,  depending  on  how  one  runs  analyses  about  fa-
tigue-life prediction, you will get very different answers. 

We  believe  strongly  that  the  NSC  will  have  a  service  life  of  at 
least  30  years,  using  the  models  that  have  been  used  to  forecast, 
predict  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC.  Depending  on  the  characteristics 
that  you  include  in  that  model—and  we’ve  run  it  against  both  the 
NSC,  that  model,  and  against  ships  that  have  been  in  service  for 
many years—the DDG–2, the Navy vessel, and the Hamilton class. 
The  predictions,  depending  on  what  assumptions  you  make,  say 
that those ships will last 3 to 8 years, ships that have been in serv-
ice for 30 to 40 years. 

Those  same  kind  of  differing  predictions  that  are  used  with  the 
NSC  will  show  it  will  last  either  53  years,  or  8  to  10  years.  And 
that  issue,  those  issues  of  fatigue-life,  when  the  first  onset  of  a 
crack  in  a  structurally  significant  area  appears  is  what’s  at  issue. 
The  structure  of  that  ship,  as  the  Commandant’s  testified  at  other 
hearings, the ship is safe, and capable of performing its operations. 

Senator SNOWE. I wish we could go on. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Senator  Snowe,  I  am  sure,  on  this  point,  we 
could  go  on,  and  I  thank  you  for  your  question,  just  the  vote  has 
started, and I believe that you are onto a question that is critically 
important,  and  that  is,  if  the  system  integrator,  basically,  is  re-
sponsible  for  developing  the  assets,  and  then  determining  whether 
they’ve  even  met  the  performance  standards,  aren’t  they  just  writ-
ing  us  a  check,  a  blank  check,  and  saying,  ‘‘Here’s  the  bill,’’  and 
changing the process along the way. 

I  know  that,  Dr.  Mackay  and  Mr.  Teel,  you  disagree  with  that 
assessment,  but  we’re  going  to  have  to  submit  more  questions  for 
the  record  for  you  to  answer  on  this.  Because  I  don’t  think  this  is 
the last of this hearing. 

And I’ve asked myself this question—how did we get into this sit-
uation?  And  innovation  is  important,  but  I  was  struck  by  a  thesis 
paper  that  was  online,  done  by  an  MIT  graduate  in  2004,  on  this 
very  subject.  Surprising—sometimes  you  can  get  the  most  blunt 
and honest assessments about what’s going on in Washington, D.C. 
outside of Washington, D.C. 

Here’s  what  he  wrote  about  this  situation.  He  said,  ‘‘Given  the 
risks of placing an organization’s future in the hands of another or-
ganization (namely the systems integrator contractor), one wonders 
why  the  Deepwater  Program  was  pursued  in  a  non-traditional 
manner  that  emphasized  a  system  approach  and  mission  perform-
ance. Several potential arguments exist. 

Perhaps  the  Coast  Guard’s  limited  success  in  retaining  talented 
individuals  had  developed  a  gap  in  internal  project  management 
capabilities.  Perhaps  the  Coast  Guard  merely  wanted  to  go  ‘faster’ 
than  its  own  capabilities  would  allow,  and  an  external  systems  in-
tegrator  could  serve  as  surge  capacity.  Perhaps  cost  management 
was  the  primary  objective,  and  the  use  of  a  single  contractor 
streamlined  the  acquisition  process  and  allowed  for  consistency  in 
staffing  and  contract  administration.  Perhaps  the  Coast  Guard 
wanted  to  shift  the  risk  of  system  development  to  an  external

90 

party,  an  organization  to  carry  the  blame  if  and  when  the  mod-
ernization process failed in any way. Perhaps the Coast Guard was 
expending some of the potential capital it had developed with Con-
gress to experiment with innovative contracting. 

While all of these explanations are possible, the most compelling 
story  is  presented  by  examining  status  imbalances,  and  organiza-
tional competition at two levels: among internal Coast Guard com-
munities,  and  across  the  Coast  Guard’s  competitor  organizations. 
External status dynamics led to a Coast Guard focused on securing 
the  services  of  a  Tier  1  contractor,  one  capable  of  pulling  their 
funding needs through the system. For as noted by Deepwater Pro-
gram  Executive  Officer  Rear  Admiral  Patrick  Stillman,  where  he 
quoted, 

‘A partner with Tier 1 supplier affords one the opportunity to le-
verage  their  network,  influence,  and  political  savvy  in  terms  of 
funding obtainment and sustainment, as well as program accelera-
tion  . . .  Selection  of  a  Tier  1  contractor  was  a  very  important  con-
sideration  in  a  program  of  this  scope  and  scale,  you  just  can’t  get 
that  kind  of  leverage  from  a  Tier  2  supplier.’  Quote,  ‘Vance  Kauf-
man,’ ho  was  the  Lockheed  Martin  CEO),  ‘doesn’t  have  a  problem 
getting  on  Tom  Ridge’s  calendar,  and  that  helps  in  a  way  that  no 
Tier 2 supplier can ever help.’ 

Now,  I  believe  in  integration,  and  I  believe  in  innovation,  but 
gentlemen,  I  think  we  are  at  a  point  where  now  the  taxpayer  is 
paying  a  higher  bill  because  of  a  lack  of  oversight  and  account-
ability  than  was  previously  there  in  procurement  processes  with 
the  Coast  Guard.  I  get  that  this  was  an  ambitious  program,  and 
one  that  the  Coast  Guard  wants  to  continue  to  implement,  but  I 
think this committee has many more questions to answer. 

I thank you for your testimony today, and we will continue, Sen-
ator Snowe, working on this issue to resolve this in the best inter-
est of the taxpayers. 

This hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 4:55 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Today’s hearing should shed some light on the challenges the Coast Guard’s Deep-
water program has encountered, and provide insights on options for moving forward. 
The  Deepwater  program  is  essential  to  the  Coast  Guard’s  success  in  the  post-9/ 
11  world.  Considering  the  aging  condition  of  the  Coast  Guard  fleet  and  the  Coast 
Guard’s  expanded  responsibilities,  the  Deepwater  acquisitions  are  vital  to  ensure 
that the Coast Guard can carry out its many security and other responsibilities, in-
cluding search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and drug interdiction. It is impera-
tive that the Deepwater assets meet the needs of the Coast Guard in this changing 
environment. It is equally important that American tax dollars are well spent. 

The recent release of two reports by the Department of Homeland Security Inspec-
tor General (DHS IG) on the National Security Cutter (NSC) and the 123-foot patrol 
boats, and a major study by the Defense Acquisition University raise concerns about 
the Deepwater program and the manner in which the Deepwater contract has been 
managed by the Coast Guard. 

As  the  Committee  with  oversight  responsibility  for  the  Coast  Guard,  we  have  an 
integral  role  to  play  to  ensure  that  the  Coast  Guard  obtains  the  tools  it  needs  and 
that  any  problems  with  this  major  project  are  appropriately  addressed.  Admiral 
Allen knows that this Committee has confidence in his extraordinary leadership and 
proven record and we are committed to working with him to solve this problem. 

I  thank  all  of  the  witnesses  for  appearing  before  us  today  and  look  forward  to 

their testimony. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN 

Question  1.  I  appreciate  that  the  Coast  Guard  is  taking  important  steps  in  the 
right direction, such as creating its Blue Print for Acquisition Reform. But as I men-
tioned, the Defense report called for much greater changes, including that the Coast 
Guard  should  ‘‘define  and  implement  a  revised  acquisition  strategy  that  does  not 
rely on a single industry entity or contract to produce or support all or the majority 
of USCG capabilities. The strategy should incorporate the use of business case anal-
yses to balance the benefits of robust competition, the USCG organic support infra-
structure, and trusted supplier relationships.’’ Does the Coast Guard actually intend 
to re-enter a contract with ICGS in the face of this advice? 

Do you really believe after all of these failures and the advice of the Defense Uni-
versity  that  the  lead  systems  integrator  structure  is  the  right  approach  for  the 
Coast Guard, and that all you need are a few small changes to the contract? 

It  is  my  understanding  that  the  Coast  Guard  is  not  obligated  to  continue  under 
its  present  contractual  arrangement  with  ICGS  if  you  determine  it  is  not  to  the 
Coast Guard’s benefit. Is that accurate? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  has  not  ruled  out  continuing  the  contract  with  ICGS, 
but  only  if  we  determine  that  it  is  in  our  interest.  We  are  considering  all  procure-
ment  options.  The  Coast  Guard  recognizes  that  Deepwater  acquisition  has  suffered 
setbacks.  We  are  in  the  process  of  a  thorough  examination  of  all  issues  that  have 
an impact on the program success. 

To that end, the Coast Guard has formulated seven strategic initiatives to reform 
the Coast Guard’s role in systems integration, specification standards, and logistics. 
The execution of these initiatives requires careful planning to avoid unintended con-
sequences  to  existing  contracts  that  could  create  additional  costs  and  schedule 
delays. Also, the Coast Guard is restructuring its acquisition organization and proc-
esses to facilitate implementing these initiatives. 

Under  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations,  any  contract  may  be  terminated  for 
default  if  the  contractor  fails  to  perform  adequately  according  to  contract  require-
ments.  In  other  circumstances,  if  it  is  in  the  Government’s  interest,  any  contract

may  be  terminated  for  convenience,  regardless  of  contractor  performance.  However, 
no  contract  termination  is  valid  unless  the  Government  satisfies  the  requirements 
of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 49. 

In  the  case  of  Deepwater,  the  proposed  restructuring  will  require  at  least  6 
months  to  fully  implement.  Therefore,  we  need  to  preserve  the  ability  to  continue 
contracting with ICGS until we complete restructuring. 

Question  2.  A  key  reason  for  using  the  unique  Lead  System  Integrator  approach 
was to provide integrated assets. Tell me, what is integrated about the 123-foot ves-
sels, the Fast Response Cutter-B, and the National Security Cutter? 

Answer.  An  integrated  approach  is  necessary  to  make  sure  that  the  different 
types of assets needed by the Coast Guard can operate together and in order to pre-
vent  systems  and  communications  incompatibility.  Different  types  of  assets  are 
needed  for  different  missions.  In  a  given  mission,  a  combination  of  assets  will  be 
needed.  It  is  imperative  that  a  cutter,  a  helicopter  and  a  communications  system 
be able to work seamlessly. 

Question  3.  Isn’t  it  possible  to  integrate  Coast  Guard  assets  without  relying  on 

a single entity to manage the entire 25-year, $24 billion contract? 

Answer. It is possible to integrate Coast Guard assets without relying on a single 
entity to manage the entire 25-year, $24 billion contract as long as the Coast Guard 
establishes an internal organization that would be responsible for the ‘‘systems engi-
neering  and  integration’’  functions.  It  is  imperative  that  such  internal  organization 
be  established  to  ensure  proper  systems  engineering  and  integration  of  Deepwater 
assets,  including  enterprise  architecture  and  planning;  portfolio  analysis;  cross  pro-
gram support; and test/evaluation. This will take time, but the new Acquisition Di-
rectorate will be moving toward that goal. 

Further,  to  assure  that  our  different  assets  develop  in  an  integrated  manner,  an 
oversight  mechanism  is  needed  that  will  assure  interoperability.  We  are  examining 
whether  this  objective  can  be  achieved  by  means  other  than  using  a  single  entity. 
Question  4.  Do  you  continue  to  think  that  the  mix  of  assets  proposed  by  ICGS 
in their Deepwater solution is the right mix, or are there other vessels, aircraft and 
systems that might serve the Coast Guard well? 

Answer.  The  mix  of  assets  was  developed  in  2002  and  revised  in  2005.  Since  the 
implementation  plan  extends  out  to  2027,  there  will  likely  be  changes  to  the  mix 
to meet changing missions, take advantage of new technologies, and address threat 
changes in the operating environment. However, given that the goal was to replace 
Coast  Guard  Deepwater  assets  with  an  integrated  system,  the  basic  asset  architec-
ture remains sound. 

Question 5. Other than the relatively minimal incentive for competition in the re-
vised  award  term  criteria,  what  power  does  the  Coast  Guard  have  to  ensure  ade-
quate  competition  under  the  Deepwater  contracting  approach?  Is  the  level  of  com-
petition adequate in your opinion? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  has  the  legal  authority  to  require  competition  at  the 
subcontract  levels  through  contract  terms  and  conditions.  In  addition,  the  con-
tracting officer can reserve the right to consent to subcontracts prior to their award 
to  ensure  that  adequate  competition  has  been  obtained.  While  the  Coast  Guard  is 
taking  a  larger  role  in  the  integration  of  the  Deepwater  Program  and  it  will  con-
tinue  to  evaluate  any  assets  or  capabilities  that  can  be  competed  outside  the  Inte-
grated Coast Guard Systems indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract. Where 
it  makes  good  business  sense  to  do  so,  the  Coast  Guard  will  conduct  its  own  com-
petition.  These  current  and  future  efforts  will  ensure  adequate  competition.  There-
fore, we believe we have a good level of competition. 

Question 6. You have mentioned that the Coast Guard would be open to utilizing 
the  Navy’s  contracting  expertise  and  maximizing  buying  power  and  minimize  risk 
by  purchasing  existing  assets,  such  as  the  Navy’s  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle  ‘‘Fire 
Scout’’. I also see in your FY08 budget request that the Coast Guard plans on delay-
ing  funding  for  the  Offshore  Patrol  Cutter  to  study  whether  the  Navy’s  Littoral 
Combat  Ship  might  work  for  the  Coast  Guard.  Does  this  approach  signal  a  new 
Coast Guard strategy? 

Answer.  I  do  not  consider  this  to  be  a  new  strategy.  The  sixth  strategic  element 
of  the  USCG’s  Maritime  Strategy  for  Homeland  Security  is  to  Ensure  Readiness  of 
the Coast Guard for Homeland Defense. One of the near-term initiatives to support 
that  strategic  element  includes  fielding  Deepwater  Assets  to  increase  Operational 
Capability  and  DOD  compatibility.  If  we  can  use  assets  that  are  being  developed 
by our sister service, the U.S. Navy, we increase compatibility. We also have a Na-
tional Fleet Policy Agreement with the U.S. Navy, signed by ADM Mullen and ADM 
Collins last March, that states our ‘‘. . . forces will be designed, whenever possible, 
around common command, control, and communications equipment and operational, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00096 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

93 

weapons  and  engineering  systems,  and  include  coordinated  operational  planning, 
procurement,  training,  and  logistics.’’  It  also  makes  sense  to  look  at  alternative  as-
sets  if  they  can  do  our  missions  and  do  them  at  a  lower  cost.  Often  this  lower  cost 
comes  from  Navy  accomplishing  the  initial  training  and  logistics,  with  the  Coast 
Guard paying the Navy for the incremental cost of supporting the Coast Guard. 

Question  7.  On  June  21,  2005,  this  subcommittee  held  a  hearing  on  the  revised 
Deepwater Implementation Plan. At that hearing I asked your predecessor, Admiral 
Collins, if using a lead systems integrator is the best way to control costs, especially 
given  the  experience  of  the  Army  with  the  Future  Combat  System  acquisition.  Ad-
miral Collins responded to me that the lead systems integrator mitigates risk to the 
Coast  Guard  versus  using  a  traditional  procurement  approach.  That  if  the  Coast 
Guard  were  to  do  this  acquisition  in-house,  it  would  be  at  least  15  percent  more 
costly. 

Now,  2  years  later,  you’re  dealing  with  huge  cost  overruns  with  the  NSC,  FRC, 
and other assets. Does the Coast Guard still hold the views expressed by your pred-
ecessor,  that  the  lead  systems  integrator  is  the  best  approach  and  will  produce  the 
best value for taxpayers? 

Answer.  This  method  is  a  way  to  make  sure  that  different  types  of  assets  will 
work with each other. It is also a way to avoid the risk of duplicating functions that 
can  occur  when  conducting  semi-autonomous  acquisition.  At  a  time  in  which  many 
Coast Guard assets are reaching the end of their service life in a 10-year period and 
in  a  time  of  constrained  budgets,  it  is  important  to  maximize  interoperability  and 
minimize duplicative efforts. 

In  2002,  the  Coast  Guard  could  not  effectively  manage  the  acquisition  with  in- 
house  resources.  Handling  the  acquisition  in-house  would  have  led  to  increased 
risks  and  increased  costs.  However,  the  Coast  Guard  is  now  taking  a  larger  role  in 
the  integration  of  the  Deepwater  Program  and  I  have  made  substantial  changes  to 
improve  government  oversight  and  control  of  the  program.  While  we  expect  some 
cost overruns on the NSC, I think it is important to point out that most of the cost 
increases  on  the  NSC  cover  increased  post-9/11  capabilities.  Increased  post-9/11  ca-
pabilities  include  Shipboard  Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  Facility  (SCIF), 
Airborne Use of Force (AUF), and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explo-
sive (CBRNE) defense. 

We are currently reviewing all aspects of the next award term contract to ensure 
that  the  role  of  the  system  integrator  is  subordinate  to  Coast  Guard  management 
and oversight. 

Question  8.  Admiral,  I  am  disturbed  by  the  IG’s  findings  that  the  Coast  Guard 
is  reinterpreting  the  performance  standard  for  the  National  Security  Cutter  in  a 
way  that  weakens  the  requirement,  from  230  days  ‘‘underway’’  to  170  to  180  days 
underway.  The  contract  seems  pretty  clear  on  its  fact  that  230  days  is  the  require-
ment. Can you please comment on that, Admiral? 

Answer. The Coast Guard did not change or decrease a performance standard but 
rather  clarified  an  ambiguity  in  the  Performance  Specification  between  the  nar-
rative  portion  of  paragraph  3.1.1.2  and  Table  3.  Section  3.1.1.2  that  indicates  the 
specifications  states,  ‘‘The  ship  is  expected  to  be  underway  230  days  in  an  average 
year.’’  Chart  3  lists  Days  Away  From  Homeport  (DAFHP)  as  230  days  per  year. 
DAFHP  is  a  more  inclusive  term  which  has  Days  Underway  as  a  subset.  Table  3 
details indicate the following: 

Days away from home port 
Transit days 
Logistics days away from homeport

The  ambiguity  between  the  narrative  in  paragraph  3.1.1.2.  and  Table  3  caused 
a  misunderstanding  about  the  number  of  underway  days  required  in  the  specifica-
tions.  However,  the  performance  specification  has  always  been  for  185  days  under-
way (165 mission days + 20 transit days). A modification was issued to remove am-
biguity  and  not  for  the  purpose  of  reducing  performance  requirements.  The  modi-
fication will show the requirement as 230 DAFHP/185 days underway. By compari-
son,  current  Coast  Guard  high-endurance  cutters  are  programmed  for  185  DAFHP/ 
135 days underway. 

Question 9. Was this decision to ‘‘redefine’’ the contract’s performance requirement 
unique to the National Security Cutter? Didn’t the Coast Guard do pretty much the

same thing with the performance specification for the 123-foot vessel conversion? In 
fact,  didn’t  the  Coast  Guard  alter  the  standard  after  the  MATAGORDA  (the  first 
123-foot vessel) didn’t meet the original contract performance requirements? 

Answer. As discussed in previous responses, the Coast Guard did not redefine con-
tract  performance  requirements  for  the  NSC.  For  the  123-foot  WPB,  the  Coast 
Guard  approved  four  revisions  to  the  performance  specification  that  primarily  ad-
dressed  concept  of  operations  conflicts  with  the  Command,  Control,  Communica-
tions,  Computers,  Intelligence,  Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  (C4ISR)  capabili-
ties.  All  revisions  to  the  specification  occurred  prior  to  the  CGC  MATAGORDA 
(WPB 1303) buckling incident. 

Question  10.  Admiral,  this  tells  me  that  the  Coast  Guard  is  letting  the  industry 
contractor  off  the  hook  because  it  could  not  meet  its  own  promises  of  performance. 
Why  would  you  want  to  do  that?  Doesn’t  that  mean  that  the  Coast  Guard  and  the 
taxpayer will cover for industry’s mistakes? 

Answer. As discussed in previous responses, the Coast Guard has not reduced per-
formance  requirements.  Rather,  there  was  an  ambiguity  in  the  performance  speci-
fication  for  the  NSC.  One  section  specified  230  days  underway  without  elaboration, 
while  a  table  in  the  specifications  in  another  section  correctly  listed  the  details  re-
garding the 230 days. The table showed the following: 

Transit days—vessel is underway 
Logistics days away from home port (at pier or anchored and not underway) 
Mission days—vessel is underway 

Days away from home port

The performance specification has not been changed; it has been clarified to avoid 

any future misunderstandings. 

Question 11. Why did the Coast Guard ignore the concerns of its own engineering 
experts  and  decide  to  go  ahead  with  construction  of  the  National  Security  Cutter? 
Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  did  not  ignore  the  concerns  of  its  engineering  experts 
prior  to  awarding  the  NSC  1  Production  DTO  0030BC  on  22  June  2004.  In  fact, 
throughout the preliminary, contract, and detail design phases the Coast Guard re-
quired  ICGS  to  re-examine  many  of  the  design  details  that  resulted  in  numerous 
improvements to Longitudinal Bulkhead, Side Shell and Superstructure, and the 01 
Level  Strength  Deck.  The  Coast  Guard’s  Assistant  Commandant  for  Engineering  & 
Logistics  Resources  (CG–4)  structural  concerns  regarding  Strength  Deck  Stringer 
Plates,  Superstructure  Re-entrant  Design,  Shell  Fashion  Plates,  Hangar  Racking 
Strength,  Hole  Control,  01  Knuckle,  and  Reduction  Gear  Structure  required  addi-
tional  analytical  study  in  order  to  understand  them  and  determine  any  necessary 
design changes. Having weighed the cost, schedule, and performance risks, the Pro-
gram Executive Officer (PEO) elected to award DTO 0030BC while pursuing a par-
allel path of conducting an independent assessment of the CG–4 concerns. It is im-
portant to note that these engineering experts filled billets and positions established 
by Deepwater to accomplish these types of reviews. 

In  March  2005,  the  Coast  Guard,  using  Deepwater  funds,  commissioned  Naval 
Surface Warfare Center—Carderock Division (NSWC–CD) to perform an assessment 
of  the  National  Security  Cutter’s  (NSC)  structural  design  and  fatigue-life.  The 
USCG maintained close communication with NSWC–CD throughout the duration of 
the study and received several progress reports in the form of round table technical 
briefings. It was not until December 2005 that NSWC–CD, in a preliminary report, 
advised  the  Coast  Guard  that  they  had  determined  a  fatigue  problem.  NSWC–CD’s 
final  report  was  delivered  to  the  Coast  Guard  in  October  2006  after  going  through 
NSWC–CD’s quality review process. 

Based  on  fatigue  load  model  updates  performed  by  NSWC–CD,  finite  element 
models  established  by  NSWC  plus  reviews  and  inputs  from  structural  experts  from 
the CG–4 Engineering and Logistics Center (ELC), maximum permissible stress lev-
els  for  the  NSC  were  developed.  The  Coast  Guard  and  ICGS  developed  a  technical 
solution to structurally enhance NSC 3–8 prior to production award based on those 
maximum permissible stress levels. ICGS provided the Coast Guard with a cost pro-
posal  based  on  the  technical  data  on  22  February  2007.  The  proposal  is  currently 
under  review  and  will  be  negotiated  in  conjunction  with  the  award  of  NSC  3.  The 
Coast  Guard  is  continuing  to  analyze  and  develop  solutions  to  make  modifications 
to NSC 1 and 2 after delivery well before fatigue-life becomes an issue. 

If  the  Coast  Guard  had  elected  to  not  award  DTO  0030BC  in  June  2004  in  lieu 
of  mitigating  all  structural  concerns,  and  given  the  fact  that  it  took  approximately 
2 years in analyzing and developing structural enhancement solutions, then produc-

tion  of  NSC  1  would  have  been  delayed  significantly  with  compounding  impacts  to 
cost  and  subsequent  NSC  construction  schedules.  During  those  2  years,  the  378 
WHECs,  which  will  be  replaced  by  the  NSCs,  continued  to  experience  maintenance 
problems  and  a  loss  of  underway  days.  In  order  to  ensure  continued  capabilities  to 
meet  maritime  missions,  the  best  approach  for  the  Coast  Guard  was  to  continue 
NSC construction while the final structural enhancements were being designed. 

Question 12. The IG’s report says that the Coast Guard determined that it would 
be  more  costly  to  delay  construction  than  to  address  design  concerns  early  in  the 
process. Is there any documentation that this is true? 

Answer. No formal Business Case Analysis was performed to quantify the cost in 
delaying construction. Although structural concerns with the National Security Cut-
ter  (NSC)  design  were  identified  in  the  Integrated  Product  Team  (IPT)  process,  the 
Program Executive Officer (PEO) decided that the large cost in delaying production 
outweighed  the  potential  cost  impact  of  delaying  the  remaining  technical  modifica-
tions until later hull production and retrofitting the initial hulls as needed. The de-
cision  to  award  DTO  0030BC  was  thoroughly  and  appropriately  documented  in  de-
tail  by  two  decision  memoranda  (one  by  the  Agency  Acquisition  Executive  for  base-
line change items and the other by the Deepwater PEO addressing all other consid-
erations). 

Additional documentation leading up to the DTO award decision includes: (1) the 
briefing documenting the findings of the DTO Readiness Review (a decision meeting 
conducted  by  the  NSC  IPT);  (2)  two  briefings  by  the  Integrated  Deepwater  System 
Contracting  Officer  to  the  PEO  providing  a  list  of  the  risk  items  that  must  be 
cleared prior to the DTO award; and (3) a series of IPT minutes, that document the 
IPT  tracked  Critical  Design  Review  Exit  Criteria,  including  risk  items  that  had  to 
be  resolved  prior  to  award  of  DTO  0030BC.  These  minutes  included  structural 
issues carried by the IPT as a risk management item. None of the recommendations 
in  these  documents  contradicted  the  PEO’s  decision.  The  following  structural  en-
hancements  were  incorporated  in  the  NSC  design  before  production  began  on  NSC 
1. 

sert plate 

• Redesigned inner bottom structure beneath reduction gear. 
• Removed superstructure expansion joint 
• Reduced size of 01 deck penetrations and increased thickness of surrounding in-
• Installed superstructure fashion plates 
• Installed Hovgaard bulkheads 
Question 13. Since the Deepwater contract was signed in June 2002, the combined 
cost of NSC 1 and 2 has increased from $517 million to approximately $775 million. 
But this figure does not yet include costs due to production delays, costs due to Hur-
ricane  Katrina,  or  costs  for  needed  modifications  to  the  NSC  design.  I  understand 
the  combined  cost  of  NSC  1  and  2  could  be  $1  billion  or  more.  Is  that  true?  $500 
million more than the original cost? 

Who  will  pay  for  these  costs  increases?  What  is  the  Coast  Guard  doing  to  recoup 

costs? 

Who  will  bear  the  cost  for  needed  design  changes  to  both  the  NSC  3  through  8 

that are not yet constructed? 

Answer. The amount of $517.0M used in the 2002 contract for the first two NSCs 
did not include post-9/11 requirements changes, inflation from 2002 to 2007, or hur-
ricane  impacts.  The  below  table  summarizes  our  current  cost  estimates  for  NSCs  1 
and 2 based on all project needs:

Equipment and items such as Testing/Evaluation, and Engineering Changes. 

(C) Assumption based on guidance provided by OMB. 
(D) Congress  funded  an  additional  $123M  in  FY  2006  for  hurricane-related  costs  for  the  NSC  1  and  the 

NSC 2. 

The  change  in  the  amount  of  funding  required  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Coast 
Guard  for  Post-9/11  Changes,  government  items,  associated  inflation  impacts  and 
hurricane  damage.  All  of  the  Engineering  Change  Proposals  except  for  the  struc-
tural upgrades are related to the Post-9/11 Changes. The exact cost of these changes 
will  be  determined  after  negotiations.  The  Coast  Guard  has  determined  that  the 
NSC  structural  upgrade  is  not  within  the  existing  statement  of  work/specifications 
and has therefore issued a change to the NSC 3 solicitation in order to obtain a cost 
proposal that will subsequently require negotiation. If appropriate, a similar change 
will  be  made,  either  through  ICGS  or  after  delivery  of  the  ships,  to  implement  the 
structural  modifications  on  NSC  1  and  2.  For  NSC  1  and  2,  the  structural  changes 
will be incorporated through a change to existing contract terms or a new ship modi-
fication contract. 

For  NSC  3  and  future  ships  the  cost  for  necessary  structural  modifications  will 

be incorporated into a new contract agreement. 

Question 14. Why was Northrop Grumman going ahead with ordering lead mate-
rials  and  taking  other  steps  for  construction  when  the  NSC  designs  had  not  even 
been  approved  by  the  Coast  Guard?  It  sounds  to  me  like  Northrop  already  had  the 
Coast Guard locked in to buying a questionable design. 

Answer.  Although  Long  Lead  Time  Material  (LLTM)  is  normally  ordered  after 
Critical Design Review (CDR) (03 June 2003), the Deepwater Program Office elected 
to  award  LLTM  on  19  March  2003  upon  completion  of  Preliminary  Design  Review 
(PDR) (11 March 2003). Due to the limited availability of shipboard equipment/sys-
tems  and  the  limited  pool  of  suppliers,  it  is  common  for  shipyards  to  require  more 
than  12  months  for  LLTM  orders.  With  what  appeared  at  the  time  to  be  minimal 
risk in the design changing from PDR to CDR, the Deepwater Program Office elect-
ed  to  award  LLTM  to  preserve  schedule.  All  materials  from  all  LLTM  orders  prior 
to CDR are usable, even with structural upgrades. 

Question 15. Why does the Coast Guard plan to take delivery of the National Se-

curity Cutters 1 and 2 even though they have design flaws? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  does  not  intend  to  take  delivery  of  NSC  1  or  NSC  2 
until each cutter has completed Acceptance Trials and ICGS has demonstrated that 
each cutter meets the specified Performance Requirements. Any structural modifica-
tions on NSC 1 and NSC 2 will largely be completed during each of the cutters’ post- 
delivery yard availabilities. Both cutters will be fully capable of all mission require-
ments  and  are  expected  to  meet  performance  specifications  throughout  their  ex-
pected service life. 

Question  16.  Isn’t  there  a  chance  that  the  problems  with  the  first  National  Secu-
rity Cutter could require repairs sooner than at regularly-scheduled maintenance (5 
years time)? Wouldn’t losing the NSC for the length of time needed to make repairs 
impose an additional strain on the Coast Guard’s urgent national security mission? 
Answer. The Deepwater Program Office and the Coast Guard Technical Authority 
(the  Assistant  Commandant  for  Engineering  and  Logistics  Resources  (CG–4))  are 
currently  developing  structural  enhancement  retrofit  solutions  to  be  incorporated 
during  planned,  post  shakedown  maintenance  availabilities  for  NSC  1  and  NSC  2. 
The  first  maintenance  availability  (approx.  3 nths  in  duration),  scheduled  to  com-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

97 

mence 12 months after delivery, has been incorporated into the Pacific Area’s oper-
ational  planning  factors.  CG–4  is  developing  incremental  technical  work  packages 
that  address  specific  areas  of  concern  as  related  to  expected  fatigue/service  life. 
Those  specific  areas  with  critical  fatigue/service  concerns  will  be  incorporated  into 
the first maintenance availability. Follow-on structural modifications (as dictated by 
projected  fatigue-life)  will  be  incorporated  into  subsequent,  planned  maintenance 
availabilities. 

Question  17.  Who  will  pay  for  the  needed  repairs  to  both  the  NSC  1  and  2  and 
the  design  changes  for  the  6  others  not  yet  constructed?  What  is  the  Coast  Guard 
doing to recoup costs? 

Answer. For National Security Cutters (NSC) 1 and 2, the structural changes will 
require  the  Coast  Guard  to  issue  a  change  to  existing  contract  terms  (or  to  issue 
a  new  ship  modification  contract).  For  NSC  3  and  future  ships,  the  cost  for  nec-
essary structural modifications, will be incorporated into a new contract agreement. 
Question  18.  I  understand  Northrop’s  warranty  for  the  National  Security  Cutter 
is only for 1 year after delivery. I understand that typically the Coast Guard would 
be  doing  tests  and  getting  the  ship  prepared  for  service  during  that  time,  but  that 
it will not be in actual operation by the end of that year. Given the newness of the 
designs  that  Northrop  is  using  for  these  cutters,  doesn’t  this  mean  that  the  Coast 
Guard and the American taxpayer are essentially funding industry R&D? 

Answer. Although the NSC Performance Specification is unique in kind, NGSS is 
applying existing shipbuilding standards and proven technologies in the design and 
construction of the NSC. The 1-year warranty period is typical for newly constructed 
naval  combatants  and  is  similar  to  those  employed  by  the  Navy’s  Supervisor  of 
Shipping (SUPSHIPS) at this and similar shipyards. 

Question  19.  The  two  controls  on  the  performance  of  ICGS  were  to  be:  (1)  total 
ownership costs, and (2) operational effectiveness. Has the ICGS met either of these 
with respect to the major vessels being delivered? 

Answer. Total Ownership Cost and Operational Effectiveness of each surface asset 
cannot be quantitatively measured or realized until respective assets have been de-
livered and observed in service. The NSC will be evaluated during Operational Test 
and Evaluation and during normal operations throughout its service life. 

Question  20.  Admiral,  the  testimony  of  Mr.  Teel  who  we  will  hear  from  shortly 
seems to suggest that there is nothing wrong with their design for the FRC. Do you 
agree  with  that  assessment,  and  if  not,  why?  How  could  there  be  such  a  funda-
mental difference of opinion on whether the design meets Coast Guard’s needs? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  identified  high  technical  risks  with  the  Integrated 
Coast  Guard  Systems’  (ICGS)  proposed  composite  design  that  led  to  suspension  of 
the  composite  Fast  Response  Cutter  (FRC)  design  efforts  on  27  February  2006. 
These risks were validated by an Independent Third-Party Design Review conducted 
by  Alion—John  J.  McMullen  &  Associates  (JJMA)  that  was  completed  on  10  April 
2006  and  by  a  panel  of  independent  composite  technology  experts  from  the  U.S. 
Navy,  private  industry,  academia,  and  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  who  participated  in  a 
Technology Readiness Assessment of the FRC–A composite in December 2006. These 
technical risks would impact the manufacture of the composite hull and had the po-
tential to impact cost and schedule. 

Question  21.  You  allowed  ICGS  to  award  the  design  of  the  FRC  to  itself,  when 
Northrop  Grumman  had  no  experience  with  designing  such  vessels.  Now,  years 
later, you have decided to issue a call for competitive proposals to design and build 
a  shorter-term  replacement  for  the  FRC.  Why  did  you  agree  to  allow  Northrop  to 
design  this  vessel  in  the  first  place?  And  shouldn’t  you  also  be  considering  either 
off-the-shelf designs or a full competition for the longer-term FRC? 

Who is responsible for the costs of changing the design for the longer-term vessel? 
Answer.  Under  the  overarching  Integrated  Deepwater  System  contract,  the  cur-
rent design related Delivery Task Orders (DTOs) for the FRC (which has now been 
designated  as  FRC–A  Class)  was  based  on  a  composite  hull  form  and  was  awarded 
to  ICGS  as  the  prime  Deepwater  contractor.  ICGS  in  turn  subcontracted  with  Nor-
throp  Grumman  Ship  Systems  and  Lockheed  Martin.  At  the  time  of  award,  the 
Coast  Guard  did  not  anticipate  experiencing  the  degree  of  technical  risk  that  led 
to  the  suspension  of  design  efforts  on  27  February  2006.  Within  the  DTO  descrip-
tion,  specification,  work  statement,  and  terms/conditions,  the  Coast  Guard  neither 
directed  nor  prohibited  ICGS  from  hiring  or  subcontracting  with  patrol  boat  design 
agents. At the time of the FRC–A Class DTO, there was no reason to prohibit ICGS 
from subcontracting directly to Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. 

The  Coast  Guard  intends  to  compete  all  future  design  and  construction  of  the 
FRC–B Class patrol boats as a Coast Guard procurement. The Coast Guard also re-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00101 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

mains  open  to  considering  a  parent  craft  (off-the-shelf  design)  patrol  boat  in  our 
FRC–A Class acquisition strategy.

Question  22.  I  am  very  concerned  that  the  Coast  Guard’s  Deepwater  office  may 
have  hired  former  Coast  Guard  staff  who  joined  industry  firms  before  the  appro-
priate time had passed. Can I be confident that all ethics rules were followed? 

Answer. The question suggests that the Coast Guard hires support contractor em-
ployees  directly.  Support  contractor  employees  are  hired  by  and  work  for  support 
contractors,  not  the  Coast  Guard.  All  hiring  decisions  in  these  cases  are  made  by 
support contractors, not the Coast Guard. 

Transitioning  and  transitioned  Coast  Guard  personnel  are  personally  responsible 
for  complying  with  all  post-government-service-employment  ethics  rules.  Coast 
Guard  attorneys  are  made  available  to  provide  ethics  guidance  to  all  transitioning 
and transitioned personnel to help ensure that those personnel comply with the eth-
ics  rules.  The  Coast  Guard  does  this  through  one-on-one  sessions,  group  seminars 
and online training. 

The Coast Guard takes prompt and appropriate action when it has reason to con-
clude  that  a  transitioning  or  transitioned  person  is  about  to,  or  has,  violated  any 
relevant ethics rule. 

Question 23. I must admit that I am also concerned with the lack of transparency 
and quite frankly, honesty, in Coast Guard’s dealings with Congress on these issues. 
Just  last  year  in  our  hearing  on  the  Coast  Guard’s  budget,  you  told  me  that  you 
had  walked  on  the  first  National  Security  Cutter  from  stem  to  stern  and  that  all 
was  fine  with  this  ship.  In  fact,  you  already  knew  then  that  there  were  concerns 
regarding its design. Now, here we are at this hearing. I think you would agree that 
we  need  more  open  and  frequent  communications  from  the  Coast  Guard  on  Deep-
water? And that this would help, not hurt, the Coast Guard and the likelihood that 
this program will be a success? Can I rely on you to provide more frequent and open 
information about Deepwater going forward? 

Answer. I agree that we need more open and frequent communication, and believe 
that such communication will benefit the overall success of the Deepwater Program 
as we move forward. The Deepwater Program Office is prepared to provide monthly 
briefings  on  all  surface/system  assets  similar  to  the  regularly  scheduled  monthly 
briefings  being  provided  to  the  House  and  Senate  Appropriations  Committee  staffs 
on  the  patrol  boat  replacement  effort  and  development  of  the  FRC.  We  value  the 
oversight  the  Congress  provides  and  will  expeditiously  respond  to  any  requests  for 
additional Deepwater Program information. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN 

Question  1.  Admiral  Allen,  I  am  one  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  strongest  supporters, 
and have long supported the Deepwater program. However, the list of problems with 
the  conversion  of  major  vessels  and  other  assets  under  the  contract  raise  concerns 
that  there  are  fundamental  problems  with  the  entire  Deepwater  program.  Do  you 
think  the  individual  issues  that  have  occurred  are  merely  isolated  incidents,  or  are 
they indicative of more serious problems? 
Answer. The structural issues experienced on the 110′ to 123′ conversion are con-
sidered to be isolated within the 123′ Conversion Program. However, to increase the 
assurance  that  follow-on  Deepwater  surface  assets  are  properly  designed  and  con-
structed  to  an  integrated  and  comprehensive  set  of  standards,  the  Coast  Guard  in-
tends  to  expand  the  role  that  the  American  Bureau  of  Shipping  (ABS)  will  play  in 
the Deepwater Program. Additionally, the Coast Guard is installing additional engi-
neering rigor and oversight in the development of Deepwater Designs by way of: 

• Requiring  Contractor  to  incorporate  and  to  provide  coarse-mesh  and  fine-mesh 
finite element models as Contract Data Deliverables in the design of subsequent 
assets. 
• Requiring  Contractor  to  obtain  consent  to  subcontract  with  future  design 
• Conducting  Technology  Readiness  Assessments  of  future  surface  assets  before 
• Increasing application of Independent Third-Party Review and Analyses. 
• Formalizing the role of the Coast Guard’s Chief Engineer and Technical Author-

awarding Design DTOs. 

agents. 

ity.

ment  reforms.  What  is  your  plan  to  address  the  other  problems  identified  and  get 
the program moving in the right direction? 

Answer.  Sir,  I  believe  the  changes  that  I  have  made  will  get  the  Deepwater  Pro-

gram moving in the right direction. They include: 

to form one Acquisition Shop to increase efficiency and improve processes. 

• Moving Deepwater acquisition staff and resources to the Acquisition Directorate 
• Designating  the  Assistant  Commandant  for  Engineering  and  Logistics  Re-
sources (CG–4) as the Coast Guard’s technical authority for all new ship acqui-
sition designs. 
• Adding  staff  on  the  government  side  to  the  Deepwater  Program  to  perform 
greater  contractor  oversight  and  assume  some  of  the  system  integrator  duties. 
Initiate  a  Business  Case  Analysis  for  all  new  acquisition  decisions  to  ensure  we 
are building and buying the right tools for our Coast Guard men and women at the 
best value to the government. 

Question  3.  Admiral,  at  our  budget  hearing  last  June,  I  asked  you  if  there  were 
any  projects  besides  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  within  the  Deepwater  Program  that 
were  experiencing  problems,  and  made  a  specific  mention  of  the  National  Security 
Cutter.  While  your  answer  mentioned  some  cost  increases,  it  did  not  mention  any 
other problems. However, the DHS Inspector General’s report on the National Secu-
rity  Cutter  indicates  that  design  flaws  were  an  issue  prior  to  that  time.  At  what 
point were you made aware of the problems highlighted by the DHS IG? 

Answer. To clarify my testimony, on 14 June 2006 I stated ‘‘There are some tech-
nical  issues  associated  with  the  construction  that  we  will  address  in  subsequent 
hulls.’’  Regarding  the  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC,  the  Deepwater  PEO  informed  me  in 
March of 2005 that he was tasking Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Divi-
sion  to  perform  an  independent  analysis  of  the  NSC  to  address  the  Assistant  Com-
mandant for Engineering & Logistic Resources (CG–4) concerns regarding the struc-
tural  adequacy  and  fatigue-life  of  NSC  critical  areas.  On  5  September  2005  I  was 
deployed to the Gulf Coast as the Principal Federal Official for Hurricanes Katrina 
and Rita. I did not resume my duties as Chief of Staff until February 2006. At that 
time  I  was  made  aware  that  the  DHS  Inspector  General  was  concluding  the  audit. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN 

Question 1. I believe the Coast Guard should drop its contractors, solicit new con-
tractors  through  an  open  and  competitive  bidding  process,  and  assert  firm  control 
over  every  important  managerial  decision.  Do  you  agree?  If  not,  what  is  the  alter-
native? 

Answer. I agree that the Coast Guard must assert firm control over critical man-
agement  decisions  and  that  is  why  I  have  made  several  critical  changes  that  will 
ensure the Coast Guard is the decisionmaker. For Deepwater, this includes the use 
of  Business  Case  Analyses  (BCA)  for  all  major  acquisition  decisions,  use  of  third- 
party  analysis,  incorporation  of  relevant  GAO  and  IG  audit  recommendations,  ele-
vating  the  role  of  the  Coast  Guard  technical  authority,  reorganizing  the  Integrated 
Product  Teams  (IPT)  to  be  led  by  qualified  Coast  Guard  personnel  and  adoption  of 
the ‘‘Coast Guard Blueprint for Acquisition Reform’’ as a framework for a new model 
acquisition organization. 

The Short Range Prosecutor (SRP) is an example of where a BCA suggested going 
outside  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  (ICGS)  as  the  preferred  alternative.  I  will 
hold ICGS accountable for making sure that awards are based on best value source 
selection. If ICGS is unable to satisfy this requirement, I will turn to other procure-
ment  alternatives  that  can  result  in  awards  based  on  best  value  source  selection. 
Question  2.  Do  you  believe  that  Lockheed  and  Northrop  made  management  and 
purchasing  decisions  that  increased  their  bottom  line  at  the  expense  of  efficiency 
and concern for the taxpayer? 

Answer. The Coast Guard is not privy to the information that motivated the busi-
ness  decisions  of  either  Lockheed  or  Northrop;  thus,  the  Coast  Guard  is  unable  to 
answer the question asked. 

Question 3. Do you believe that the delays and management problems with Deep-

water have compromised national security? 
Answer.  The  delays  and  problems  experienced  with  delivered  assets  such  as  the 
123′  cutter  modifications  have  affected  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  reduce  the  gap 
in  patrol  boat  mission  hours  but  our  national  security  has  not  been  compromised. 
As  evidenced  in  our  response  to  Hurricane  Katrina,  the  Coast  Guard  has  an  inher-

100 

ent  ability  to  reallocate  resources  in  a  short  time  to  respond  to  significant  events 
and will continue to perform in this manner even as we recapitalize our cutters and 
aircraft. 

Question  4.  Does  the  Deepwater  contract  allow  the  government  to  recoup  funds 
stemming  from  design  flaws  for  the  cutters  and  patrol  boats  that  will  have  to  be 
fixed? Who pays for that? 

Answer.  In  general,  the  contractor  is  responsible  for  performing  according  to  the 
requirements of the contract and the Government is required to deal fairly with the 
contractor.  If  the  contractor  is  at  fault  for  defects  or  other  failure  of  the  product  to 
perform adequately, the Government can demand correction at no cost, have the cor-
rection  performed  by  a  different  contractor  and  charge  the  current  contractor.  The 
Government  can  also  demand  a  price  reduction;  and,  in  extreme  circumstances,  a 
termination  for  default  is  warranted.  The  Deepwater  Contract  conforms  to  all  con-
tracting principles in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). 

Question  5.  In  2004,  the  GAO  issued  its  11  recommendations  on  how  to  improve 
Deepwater.  One  was  to  study  whether  a  traditional  contract  or  multiple  contracts 
would cost less then the systems integrator contract approach you currently use. In 
spite  of  all  the  cost  overruns  and  delays  and  negative  media,  the  Coast  Guard  has 
refused  to  do  it.  Why  hasn’t  the  Coast  Guard  implemented  GAO’s  recommendation 
to study alternative contract arrangements? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  has  studied  alternative  contract  arrangements.  The 
Coast  Guard  has  the  ability  to  look  to  other  sources  for  any  part  of  the  Deepwater 
mix  of  assets  and  capabilities.  On  March  14,  2007,  ADM  Allen  signed  a  decision 
memorandum  approving  the  termination  of  the  current  FRC–B  (replacement  patrol 
boat) acquisition with ICGS and reassigning it to the Coast Guard’s acquisition Di-
rectorate.  This  action  will  ensure  full  and  open  competition,  enable  us  to  acquire  a 
patrol  boat  that  is  more  capable,  help  to  control  costs,  and  deliver  replacement  pa-
trol boats in the shortest time possible. 

• This  decision  is  based  on  the  Coast  Guard’s  ongoing  commitment  to  improving 
program  management  to  achieve  best  value  for  taxpayers  and  the  government. 
• Schedule  impacts  will  be  managed  by  combining  the  design  and  production 
• The Coast Guard expect to release the Request for Proposal (RFP) for this plan 

phases into one effort. 

in May 2007. 

Question  5a.  Isn’t  it  essential  that  the  Coast  Guard  drop  the  Systems  Integrator 

concept, whether or not it drops Lockheed and Northrop? 

Answer.  As  announced  by  ADM  Allen  on  April  17,  2007,  the  Coast  Guard  is  as-

suming a greater oversight and management role in the Deepwater Program. 

Question 5b. Don’t you think the time has come to at least study my recommenda-

tion that you drop the current contract and issue a new one? 

Answer. Prior audits and studies conducted by various entities such as GAO, and 
the  National  Defense  University  (NDU)  have  provided  feedback  on  the  ‘‘system  of 
systems’’  acquisition  strategy  and  found  it  to  be  a  valid  contracting  mechanism 
when  adequate  program  and  technical  oversight  is  applied.  The  management 
changes  that  Coast  Guard  is  currently  adopting  will  improve  the  Deepwater  Pro-
gram and be more cost effective and deliver much needed tools more quickly to the 
men  and  women  of  the  Coast  Guard  than  would  occur  if  the  current  contract  were 
dropped  and  a  new  contract  issued.  The  initial  Deepwater  Program  took  6  years  to 
go from approval of the Mission Needs Statement to contract award in 2002. It took 
an additional four to 6 years for major capital assets like the National Security Cut-
ter and the Maritime Patrol Aircraft to be close to delivery or to have been actually 
delivered. 

Question 6. Many of the problems with Deepwater stem from the unusual contract 
between  the  Coast  Guard  and  its  contractors  that  empowered  them  to  make  man-
agement  decisions  as  well  as  poor  oversight  and  decisionmaking  from  your  man-
agers and engineers. These problems have been documented for at least 5 years, and 
are deeply troubling. 

For instance, a 2004 internal Coast Guard memo from Rear Admiral Erroll Brown 
to  Rear  Admiral  P.M.  Stillman  which  outlines  Admiral  Brown’s  concerns  regarding 
design  flaws  for  the  National  Security  Cutters  seems  to  have  been  completely  ig-
nored. Admiral Brown outlined many of the structural flaws that we now know will 
cost  an  additional  $500  million  to  fix,  and  stated  that  the  contractors  ‘‘ended  any 
collaborative effort’’ to remedy them. 

So, clearly, the Coast Guard has known for some time that the ineffective collabo-

ration with its contractors is at the root of the problems we’re discussing today.

101 

Here’s  what  I  don’t  understand:  Why  did  the  Coast  Guard  decide,  in  May  2006, 
to  extend  the  contract  with  Lockheed  and  Northrop  for  43  months  starting  in  June 
2007 given what it knew at that point? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard’s  decision  regarding  the  length  of  the  award  term  was 
based upon an extensive Coast Guard review of the joint venture’s performance dur-
ing  the  first  42  months  (June  2002–December  2005)  of  the  base  period.  Based  on 
the input from the Award Term Evaluation Board using pre-determined contractual 
criteria,  the  Award  Term  Determining  Official  made  the  period  of  performance  de-
termination  which  was  43  months.  Many  aspects  of  the  program  were  considered, 
including  the  successful  C4ISR  legacy  cutter  upgrades,  the  re-engined  HH–65Cs, 
and  the  C–130J  missionization  project;  along  with  the  aspects  of  the  program  that 
were  less  successful.  The  fact  that  the  contractor  did  not  receive  an  award  term  of 
60 months is a reflection that the Coast Guard wanted improved contractor perform-
ance. While the 43-month award provides an opportunity for improved performance, 
it does not obligate the Government to award any work to ICGS or to continue with 
the  ICGS  prime  contract  during  the  Award  Term  I  period  since  the  minimum  re-
quirements of the Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract were already met 
during the base period from 2002 to 2007. 

Question 7. In your written testimony, you state: ‘‘The Coast Guard has been and 
remains  fully  involved  in  the  management  of  this  program  and  has  made  all  final 
and critical decisions.’’ 

Let me contrast this with Mr. Skinner’s written testimony. He says: 

‘‘The  Deepwater  contract  essentially  empowered  the  contractor  with  authority 
for decisionmaking. Therefore, the Coast Guard was reluctant to exercise a suf-
ficient degree of authority to influence the design and production of its own as-
sets.  Specifically,  under  the  contract  ICGS  was  the  Systems  Integrator  and  as-
signed full technical authority over all asset design and configuration decisions; 
while  the  Coast  Guard’s  technical  role  was  limited  to  that  of  an  expert  ‘advi-
sor.’ ’’ 

Can you explain the discrepancy between your view of the program and Mr. Skin-

Answer.  The  Deepwater  Acquisition  Strategy  assigned  Integrated  Coast  Guard 
Systems (ICGS) responsibilities as the Systems Integrator, to develop an integrated 
system  of  assets,  as  well  as  C4ISR  and  Logistics  components,  to  meet  the  Coast 
Guard’s  requirements.  This  strategy  was  developed  in  a  competitive  environment 
and  ICGS  was  awarded  the  contract  in  June  2002  over  two  other  competing  indus-
try teams. 

The  Assistant  Commandant  for  Engineering  and  Logistics  Resources,  the  Coast 
Guard  technical  authority,  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be  fully  involved  in  all 
asset  design  and  configuration  decisions.  As  one  example,  the  National  Security 
Cutter  (NSC)  Integrated  Product  Team,  which  included  Coast  Guard  technical  ex-
perts who were funded by Deepwater Program resources, was responsible for many 
design changes and improvements to the NSC structure well before the Coast Guard 
hired Naval Surface Warfare Center—Carderock Division to conduct a structural as-
sessment of the NSC. The Coast Guard modified every DTO that was originally pro-
posed by ICGS. Further, when the post-9/11 Mission Needs Statement changes were 
made  for  specific  assets,  adding  new  capabilities  for  and  adjusting  the  quantity  of 
each  asset,  ICGS  did  make  an  initial  recommendation,  but  the  final  mix  of  assets 
was completely decided and justified to DHS in 2004 by the Coast Guard. However, 
I  agree  with  Mr.  Skinner  that  while  the  Coast  Guard  has  always  had  this  degree 
of authority, we were at times reluctant to use it, a situation I have remedied. 

Question  8.  One  of  the  main  problems  with  Deepwater  that  have  been  identified 
by  the  IG’s  office  as  well  as  GAO  has  been  the  Coast  Guard’s  understaffed  acquisi-
tion  office.  I  know  the  Coast  Guard  is  well  aware  of  this.  At  a  recent  staff  briefing 
Rear  Admiral  Gary  Blore,  who  now  heads  the  acquisition  office,  stated  that  the 
Coast Guard’s oversight staff is only 20 percent of what the Department of Defense 
would employ on a similar sized contract. 

Can  you  tell  me  how  much  progress  you’ve  made  hiring  acquisition  staff,  espe-

ner’s? 

cially those with technical expertise? 

Answer.  The  Deepwater  Program  Office  and  the  Office  of  Acquisition  have  been 
authorized and funded for 36 new government positions for Fiscal Year 2007. We’re 
currently  recruiting  these  positions,  which  include  program  management,  technical 
engineers, logisticians, business financial managers, and contracting specialties.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TRENT LOTT TO 

ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN 

Question  1.  Please  explain  the  days  underway  and  sea  condition  inputs  for  each 
Naval  Surface  Warfare  Center  Carderock  Division’s  fatigue-life  analysis  conducted 
on the National Security Cutter (NSC). 

Answer. NSWC Carderock Division’s fatigue-life analysis was conducted using the 
computer  program  SPECTRA  for  which  6,900  days  at  sea  was  used  as  an  assump-
tion.  This  value  was  based  on  assuming  63  percent  operability  or  230  days  under-
way per year over the course of a 30-year service life. (Note: NSWC–CD unilaterally 
chose  to  use  230  days  underway.  Their  analysis  was  adjusted  later  by  the  Coast 
Guard  technical  authority  to  reflect  the  days  underway  referenced  in  the  NSC  Per-
formance Specifications). 

NSWC  Carderock  considered  two  operational  areas  for  their  analyses:  Northern 
Pacific  and  General  Atlantic.  The  sea  condition  assumptions  were  determined  by: 
(1) established wave height probabilities for specific oceanographic areas, using Ochi 
(1976) six-parameter sea spectra; and (2) probabilities associated with time spent at 
specific headings and speeds for ranges of specific wave heights. 

The  wave  height  probability  inputs  for  the  General  Atlantic  were  selected  as  a 
pre-programmed  function  of  the  SPECTRA  software.  The  General  Atlantic  wave 
height  probabilities  are  a  combination  of  the  Ochi  North  Atlantic  with  data  from 
the  Caribbean,  Mediterranean,  and  Atlantic  between  the  U.S.  East  Coast,  and 
Spain,  as  is  described  in  the  March  2000  NSWC  Carderock  Report  NSWCCD–65– 
TR–2000/07 March 2000, ‘‘User’s Guide for SPECTRA: Version 8.3’’. 

The wave height probability inputs for the Northern Pacific case were actually de-
rived  by  numerically  averaging  the  wave  height  probabilities  associated  with  three 
buoy  geographical  positions  (GP–12,  GP–13,  and  GP–16)  along  the  Gulf  of  Alaska, 
in  accordance  with  values  published  in  the  October  1995  NSWC  Carderock  report 
NSWCCD–HD–1048–01, titled ‘‘Global Wave Statistics for Structural Design Assess-
ments’’. The geographic location of the three buoy positions are portrayed in the fol-
lowing map.

At Coast Guard request, NSWC–CD also conducted analyses of 170–180 days un-

derway per year and less severe operating areas. 

103 

Question 2. Please describe how these inputs compare to the NSC concept of oper-

ations as initially developed and, if applicable, as modified. 

Answer.  The  wave  height  probability  assumption  values  used  by  Naval  Surface 
Warfare  Center  Carderock  Division  (NSWC–CD)  to  prepare  their  published  report 
include those values representative of the National Security Cutter (NSC) operating 
conditions and Concept of Operation (CONOP). NSWC–CD’s Gulf of Alaska (‘‘North-
ern  Pacific’’)  analysis  represents  operating  the  NSC  only  in  the  Gulf  of  Alaska  in 
the worst or most severe conditions of the entire Northern Pacific Ocean. The ‘‘Gen-
eral Atlantic’’ conditions represent a combination of data from the Caribbean, Medi-
terranean,  and  Atlantic  between  the  U.S.  East  Coast,  and  Spain.  These  conditions 
are  less  severe  than  sea  state  probabilities  appropriate  for  design  of  the  NSC  class 
of ships. 

In  March  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  reviewed  the  current  CONOPs  for  each  of  the 
8 NSCs and determined that the NSCs to be homeported in Alameda, California will 
experience  the  most-severe  sea  conditions  within  the  NSC  fleet.  Applying  the  same 
wave-height  statistics  used  by  NSWC–CD,  CONOPs-derived  wave  height  prob-
abilities  for  the  Alameda-based  NSCs  sea  state  probabilities  were  calculated  by  the 
Coast Guard for analyzing the NSC as a class of ships. The same professionals who 
authored  the  NSWC–CD  report  were  engaged  throughout  this  process  to  perform 
analyses from these inputs in order to derive outputs from their SPECTRA software, 
and to provide analytical advice. 

Various  scenarios  for  days  underway  per  year  were  established  by  the  Coast 
Guard  for  input  by  NSWC–CD  to  their  SPECTRA  software  program.  The  scenarios 
were  based  on:  (1)  differing  interpretations  of  Deepwater  contract  requirements 
(230, 207, and 185 days per year) and, subsequently, (2) on actual Coast Guard min-
imum requirements (170 days per year) as identified by the Coast Guard Technical 
authority: 

‘‘The  analysis  conducted  by  NSWC–CD  used  230  days  of  operation  in  the  North 
Pacific as an initial assumption and ‘‘bracketed’’ the operational profile by using 
230  days  in  the  General  Atlantic  as  a  less  severe  wave  profile  loading  case.  I 
agree with your assessment that designing the NSC to operate 230 days, on aver-
age,  each  year  in  the  North  Pacific  would  lead  to  an  overly  conservative  design. 
Enclosure (1) is a spreadsheet that G–RCD developed to illustrate the NSC oper-
ational profile for application in subsequent fatigue-life analysis calculations. By 
applying  the  current  post  delivery  OT&E  activity  schedule  and  some  basic  as-
sumptions  regarding  scheduled  and  unscheduled  availabilities,  I  conclude  the 
NSC  will  operate,  on  average,  between  170  to  180  days  per  year  in  the  Pacific 
Ocean  north  of  the  Equator.  I  therefore  recommend  that  no  less  than  170  days 
per year, on average, in the Pacific Ocean north of the Equator, with the associ-
ated  and  appropriate  sea  spectra,  be  used  as  the  operational  profile  for  fatigue 
design calculations.’’ 

Question  3.  Also,  please  describe  how  these  inputs  compare  to  the  historical  use 
of the Hamilton Class cutters that the NSC will replace and the standards used for 
Navy combatant ships. 

Answer.  Based  on  review  of  historical  data  between  1992  and  2005,  HAMILTON 

Class cutters have averaged 129 operating days underway per year. 

For  2004  and  2005,  the  Navy  reported  in  the  Navy  Ship  Operations  Assessment 
that  it  actually  had  287  ship  years  in  2004  and  252  ship  years  in  2005.  In  2004 
and  2005,  these  ships  were  underway  for  418,707  and  453,998  total  hours  respec-
tively.  This  amounts  to  60.8  ship  days  underway  per  ship  year  for  2004  and  75.1 
ship  days  underway  per  ship  year  for  2005  based  on  dividing  total  hours  by  24. 
Based on their hours, naval combatants built for the Navy, unlike those built to be 
employed  as  Coast  Guard  Cutters,  will  be  subjected  to  much  less  time  underway. 
Because the Navy and the Coast Guard have different operational tempo, personnel 
tempo,  and  maintenance  schedules,  the  average  number  of  ship  days  underway  for 
each ship in the Navy and the Coast Guard does not lend itself to a useful compari-
son. 

Question 4. I understand that the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity  Science  and  Technology  Directorate,  and  Northrup  Grumman  Ship  Systems 
has discussed a plan to fund construction of an FRC–A composite hull demonstrator 
craft. Do you support construction of such a demonstrator? 

If so, do the FY07 appropriation and FY08 request for the Deepwater program in-

clude adequate funding for the Coast Guard’s share of such a plan? 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

104 

Answer.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS),  Office  of  Science  and 
Technology has requested funding for the Composite Demonstrator Program in their 
FY  2008  budget.  The  Coast  Guard  does  not  currently  have,  nor  is  the  Coast  Guard 
requesting,  funding  in  its  budget  to  support  this  initiative.  However,  the  demon-
strator could potentially add value to Coast Guard efforts to validate the production 
readiness  and  total  ownership  cost  of  composite  patrol  boats,  such  as  the  FRC–A 
Class patrol boat. 

Question 5. Please describe the Coast Guard’s plans to house NSC commissioning 

crews during their temporary assignment to Pascagoula, MS. 

Answer. The Coast Guard is currently exploring multiple options for housing NSC 
crews,  including  other  military  and  commercial  sources.  We  are  performing  market 
research  to  determine  commercial  availability  of  berthing  in  the  Gulf  Coast  area, 
which  is  still  subject  to  impact  of  hurricane  reconstruction  demand.  The  current 
plan  for  housing  of  the  pre-commissioning  crew  of  CGC  BERTHOLF  is  for  them  to 
stay  at  a  commercial  lodging  facility  within  a  30  mile  radius  of  the  shipyard  in 
Pascagoula, MS. 

Question 6. Do these plans include the use of Navy housing? 
Answer. No. The Coast Guard investigated the availability of Navy housing with-
in 30 miles of the shipyard for berthing National Security Cutter (NSC) crews. The 
Navy’s  Lakeside  facility  in  Pascagoula,  MS  was  initially  approved,  but  because  of 
schedule changes for Navy ships under construction in Pascagoula, the Navy facility 
no longer has space available for Coast Guard crews. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN 

Question  1.  The  independent  analysis  on  the  NSC  is  complete,  and  the  Coast 
Guard  has  decided  to  incorporate  the  structural  modifications  recommended  nearly 
2 years ago. What are the final costs of these modifications and who will be respon-
sible for the additional costs? 

Answer.  Many  of  the  structural  modifications  recommended  2  years  ago  were  in-
corporated into the design prior to awarding the NSC production contract, including 
numerous  improvements  to  Longitudinal  Bulkhead,  Side  Shell  and  Superstructure, 
and  the  01  Level  Strength  Deck.  Additional  concerns  regarding  Strength  Deck 
Stringer  Plates,  Superstructure  Re-entrant  Design,  Shell  Fashion  Plates,  Hangar 
Racking Strength, Hole Control, 01 Knuckle, and Reduction Gear Structure required 
additional  analytical  study  in  order  to  understand  them  and  determine  any  nec-
essary  design  changes.  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  (ICGS)  has  submitted  a 
proposal to address this latter group, but the evaluation of the proposal and negotia-
tions  are  not  yet  complete.  The  cost  share  associated  with  these  modifications  will 
not be known until negotiations have been conducted. 

Question  2.  In  August  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  announced  the  length  of  the  next 
Deepwater  contract  award  term—43  months.  According  to  the  Coast  Guard,  the 
next  milestone  in  the  process  is  to  negotiate  the  terms  of  the  contract  between  the 
Coast Guard and ICGS. What would be the impact on the Coast Guard and the Na-
tion of not renewing the contract with ICGS? 

Considering the performance of the ICGS to date, what are other options available 
to  the  Coast  Guard  to  recapitalize  its  aging  fleet  of  vessels  and  aircraft?  To  what 
degree has the Coast Guard investigated these other options? 

Answer.  If  the  Coast  Guard  does  not  renew  the  contract  with  Integrated  Coast 
Guard System (ICGS), then the Coast Guard would have to restart the procurement 
process  for  all  Deepwater  assets.  For  large  complex  procurements  (such  as  the  Na-
tional  Security  Cutter),  it  could  take  approximately  3  years  to  award  a  contract, 
which  means  that  aging  legacy  assets  being  replaced  by  new  procurements,  would 
have to remain in service much longer than planned. In addition, there may be more 
delays  that  a  new  contractor  may  experience  in  providing  the  new  assets.  The  im-
pact  on  the  Nation  is  that  the  Coast  Guard  may  not  be  able  to  provide  its  current 
level  of  services  at  present  funding  levels  because  more  funding  would  go  into  less 
capable, maintenance intensive, high cost legacy assets, which would have to remain 
in service longer. 

The  Coast  Guard  has  a  great  deal  of  flexibility  in  recapitalizing  its  aging  fleet  of 
vessels  and  aircraft.  The  Coast  Guard  met  the  minimum  ordering  quantities  under 
the  Indefinite  Delivery-Indefinite  Quantity  contract  early  in  the  base  period  of  the 
Deepwater  contract  and  therefore  is  no  longer  obligated  to  purchase  additional  as-
sets, systems, or services through ICGS. In fact, the Coast Guard has exercised this 
option  when  ICGS  did  not  offer  the  best  value  to  the  Government.  For  example,  in

105 

July  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  decided  to  procure  the  cutter  small  boat  (short  range 
prosecutor)  using  full  and  open  competition  instead  of  using  ICGS.  On  March  14, 
2007, a similar decision was made to halt the replacement patrol boat (FRC–B) pro-
curement with ICGS and instead to procure the 12 vessels using full and open com-
petition. 

Question  3.  Several  reports  from  the  GAO  raised  concerns  about  the  Coast 
Guard’s  oversight  of  the  Deepwater  contractors.  The  IG  report  concludes  that  the 
Deepwater contract does not require ICGS or its subcontractors to act upon the ad-
vice  of  the  Coast  Guard  technical  experts.  What  actions  are  you  taking  to  improve 
the oversight of the Deepwater contractor? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  has  made  the  following  changes  in  order  to  improve 

Deepwater program management: 

to increase efficiency and improve processes. 

• Move  Deepwater  acquisition  staff  and  resources  to  the  Acquisition  Directorate 
• Designate  the  Assistant  Commandant  for  Engineering  and  Logistics  Resources 
(CG–4) as the Coast Guard’s technical authority for all new ship acquisition de-
signs. 
• Add staff on the government side to the Deepwater Program to perform greater 
• Initiate a business case analysis for new acquisition decisions to ensure we are 
building  and  buying  the  right  tools  for  our  Coast  Guard  men  and  women  and 
obtaining the best value. 

contractor oversight and assume some of the system integrator duties. 

• Increase application of independent third-party review and analyses. 
Fundamentally,  all  ICGS’  (and  its  subcontractors’)  actions  are  based  on  contract 
documents  which  must  be  approved  by  government  contracting  officers.  The  en-
hanced role of the technical authority and the Coast Guard’s ability to affect all in-
dustry actions through the contracts re-establishes government primacy on design— 
as demonstrated by the Coast Guard-directed National Security Cutter (NSC) struc-
tural enhancements and stop work of the original Fast Response Cutter (FRC). 

Question  4.  The  Defense  Acquisition  University  contends  that  reorganization  is 
necessary  but  is  not  enough.  What  are  your  thoughts  about  moving  away  from  the 
current structure of the Deepwater contract toward a more traditional full and open 
competition model? 

Answer. The Coast Guard will use the traditional full and open competition model 
to procure Integrated Deepwater System assets when it makes sense to do so. This 
occurred very recently when the Coast Guard decided that the Fast Response Cutter 
‘‘FRC–B’’  solution  proposed  by  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  was  not  the  best 
value. The decision to use traditional full and open competition for the FRC–B was 
based  on  the  Coast  Guard’s  ongoing  commitment  to  achieve  the  best  value  for  tax-
payers and the government. 

Question  5.  Does  the  Coast  Guard  need  a  systems  integrator  to  recapitalize  its 

fleet of legacy cutters and aircraft? 

Answer.  The  goal  of  the  Deepwater  Program  is  not  to  simply  recapitalize  assets, 
but  to  create  a  Coast  Guard  system  of  surface  and  air  assets  with  an  integrated 
C4ISR  and  logistics  capability.  At  the  time  the  Deepwater  Program  was  conceived, 
systems  integrator  expertise  was  not  an  inherent  core  competency  in  the  Coast 
Guard  and  it  was  determined  that  it  would  be  most  cost  effective  to  acquire  that 
expertise  from  industry.  However,  using  lessons  learned  (and  to  improve  manage-
ment  oversight  of  the  contractor),  beginning  in  the  Fall  of  2004  the  Coast  Guard 
took  steps  to  reduce  its  reliance  on  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  (ICGS).  Cur-
rently,  in  parallel  with  the  ongoing  Office  of  Acquisition  and  Deepwater  Program 
consolidation  initiative,  the  Coast  Guard  will  support  systems  integrator  functions 
with  existing  resources  allocated  to  various  organizational  components  and  aug-
mented as needed with independent (third-party) contractors and other government 
entities  in  order  to  achieve  the  required  competencies  and  capabilities.  Continued 
support  for  the  System  Engineering  and  Integration  (SE&I)  budget  request  in  the 
FY 2008 President’s budget remains essential to the success of these efforts and ini-
tiatives. 

Question 6. According to the IG report, the Coast Guard did not conduct a formal 
business  case  analysis  before  deciding  to  move  forward  on  the  NSC,  and  there  was 
very  little  background  or  documentation  to  support  the  Coast  Guard’s  reasons  for 
moving  forward.  The  Deepwater  contract  is  judged  on  cost,  schedule,  and  perform-
ance.  But  it  appears  that  at  least  in  the  case  of  the  National  Security  Cutter,  the 
Coast  Guard  sacrificed  performance,  and  possibly  cost,  to  stay  on  schedule.  When 
future  design  or  systems  issues  arise,  how  will  your  proposed  organizational

106 

changes resolve the inevitable conflict between meeting cost, schedule, and perform-
ance? 

Answer.  The  proposed  acquisition  organizational  change  will  provide  Coast 
Guard’s  operational,  project,  and  functional  chain  of  command  with  accurate  and 
timely data and information needed to resolve cost, schedule, and performance con-
flicts. Future business case analyses, with third-party review, will develop proposed 
solutions,  within  the  triple  constraints  of  cost,  schedule,  and  performance  that  best 
align  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  Coast  Guard  priorities  and 
fit tactical and strategic needs. 

The  following  initiatives  will  directly  benefit  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  address 

cost, schedule, and performance conflicts: 

• Designating  the  Assistant  Commandant  for  Engineering  and  Logistics  Re-
sources (CG–4) as the Coast Guard’s technical authority for all new ship acqui-
sition designs. 
• Adding  government  staff  to  the  Deepwater  Program  to  perform  greater  con-
• Initiating  business  case  analyses  for  new  acquisition  decisions  to  ensure  the 

tractor oversight and assume some of the system integrator duties. 

Coast Guard is building and buying the right tools for the best price. 

Question  7.  The  lack  of  Coast  Guard  acquisition  personnel  and  experience  has 
been  a  recurrent  theme  in  Deepwater  oversight  issues.  What  is  the  Coast  Guard 
doing to fill the staffing vacancies and bolster experience? 

Answer. The Coast Guard is committed to maximizing use of available civilian re-
cruitment  and  retention  incentives,  including  Direct  Hire  Authority  for  selected  ci-
vilian  series,  full  utilization  of  the  Superior  Qualification  policy,  career  entry-level 
opportunity  positions,  and  enhanced  use  of  other  available  hiring  incentives  to  en-
sure a reduction in existing staff vacancies. 

The Coast Guard has aggressively sought the assistance from experts in the field 
of  acquisition  to  help  address  the  issue  of  inexperienced  personnel.  The  recent  De-
fense  Acquisition  University  (DAU)  Deepwater  Quick  Look  Study  recommended 
changes  in  the  Coast  Guard’s  acquisition  workforce  management.  Specifically,  the 
study  recommended  a  combination  of  human  capital  initiatives  including  recruit-
ment of personnel with significant major systems acquisition experience and appro-
priate  certification  levels,  training  and  mentoring  of  existing  personnel,  and  estab-
lishment  of  policies  and  procedures  that  places  acquisition  excellence  and  develop-
ment  of  business  competencies  at  a  level  equivalent  to  the  value  the  Coast  Guard 
places on operational excellence and experience. As a result of this study, and other 
lessons learned following project execution, the Coast Guard developed the Blueprint 
for  Acquisition  Reform.  As  part  of  this  blueprint,  the  Coast  Guard  will  institute  in-
novative  approaches  to  indoctrinate  and  train  the  acquisition  workforce.  Training 
components  will  include  mandatory  entry-level  training,  tailored  CG  training,  pro-
fessional development seminars, mentorship programs, and recertification and train-
ing opportunities through DAU and the Federal Acquisition Institute. This approach 
will  help  to  ensure  professional  growth  and  opportunities  for  acquisition  certifi-
cations  at  all  levels  of  the  organization.  In  addition,  the  Coast  Guard  will  ensure 
alignment  of  newly  developed  position  descriptions  with  roles  and  responsibilities 
for  new  hires  under  the  consolidated  Deepwater/Acquisition  (CG–9)  organization  to 
facilitate  the  selection  process  for  hiring  qualified  acquisition  personnel  in  con-
tracting, program management, and other acquisition professions. 

Question 8. What can Congress do to help in this effort? 
Answer. The Coast Guard greatly appreciates Congressional support for the Presi-

dent’s FY 2008 budget request. 

Question  9.  How  will  the  transfer  of  acquisitions  personnel  to  the  OE  appropria-

tions as requested in the Coast Guard FY08 budget assist in these efforts? 

Answer.  The  transfer  of  acquisition  personnel  to  the  OE  appropriation  will  pro-
vide  a  broader  pool  of  workforce  available  to  assist  in  meeting  acquisition 
deliverables.  This  will  ensure  operational  assets  are  available  in  a  timely  manner 
to meet critical mission requirements. This transfer will also allow the Coast Guard 
additional  flexibility,  within  the  existing  FTE  caps,  to  make  higher 
level 
prioritization of personnel resources, placing AC&I priority needs alongside OE pri-
ority needs. 

Question  10.  The  IG  reports  there  was  considerable  concern  with  the  difficulties 
encountered  trying  to  obtain  access  and  information  from  the  Coast  Guard  and 
ICGS.  In  its  response,  the  Coast  Guard  stated  that  the  Department  is  working  to 
promulgate Department-wide guidance on dealing with the DHS Office of Inspector 
General.  Has  DHS  addressed  the  concerns  you  raised  about  a  Department-wide 
audit policy? 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00110 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

Has the Department promulgated a policy regarding internal audits? 
Answer. Yes, DHS is working with the Coast Guard as well as other DHS Compo-

nents to promulgate Department-wide policy on DHS OIG relations. 

promptly provided to the OIG and to assist in arranging interviews. 

DHS  current  management  directive  addresses  with  OIG  the  following  concerns: 
• OIG  procedures  requiring  Component  heads  to  ensure  that  documents  are 
• DHS  and  Component  audit  liaisons  assist  OIG  by  arranging  timely  access  to

• States  that  DHS  employees  shall  ‘‘not  conceal  information  or  obstruct  audits, 

documents and officials, while minimizing operational impact. 

tion pertaining to matters under investigation or review.’’ 

inspections, investigations, or other official inquiries.’’ 

Question 11. In his testimony, Captain Jarvis said that as Deepwater assets were 
being developed, the Coast Guard ignored the opinions of some of its own engineers 
in favor of those from the industry-led Integrated Product Teams. Do you agree with 
his assessment? How did the Coast Guard reconcile differences between its own ex-
perts and industry experts? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  did  not  ignore  the  concerns  of  its  engineering  experts 
prior  to  awarding  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC)  1  Production  DTO  on  June 
22, 2004. In fact, throughout the preliminary, contract, and detail design phases the 
Coast Guard required ICGS to re-examine many design details that resulted in nu-
merous  improvements  to  longitudinal  bulkhead,  side  shell,  and  superstructure,  and 
the  01  level  strength  deck.  The  Assistant  Commandant  for  Engineering  and  Logis-
tics Resources (CG–4) identified structural concerns regarding strength deck string-
er  plates,  superstructure  re-entrant  design,  shell  fashion  plates,  hangar  racking 
strength, hole control, 01 knuckle, and reduction gear structure that required addi-
tional  analytical  study  to  understand  them  and  determine  if  design  changes  were 
necessary.  Having  considered  the  cost,  schedule,  and  performance  risks,  the  PEO 
elected to award the NSC 1 Production DTO while pursuing a parallel path of con-
ducting an independent assessment of the CG–4 concerns. 

In  March  2005,  Deepwater  Program  funds  were  used  for  Naval  Surface  Warfare 
Center—Carderock  Division  (NSWC–CD)  to  perform  an  assessment  of  the  NSC’s 
structural design and fatigue-life. The Coast Guard maintained close communication 
with  NSWC–CD  throughout  the  study  and  received  several  progress  reports  in  the 
form of round table technical briefings. It was not until December 2005 that NSWC– 
CD,  in  a  preliminary  report,  advised  the  Coast  Guard  that  they  had  detected  a  fa-
tigue-life problem. NSWC–CD’s final report was delivered to the Coast Guard in Oc-
tober 2006. 

Based  on  fatigue-load  model  updates  performed  by  NSWC–CD,  finite  element 
models  established  by  NSWC–CD,  plus  reviews  and  input  from  structural  experts 
from  the  CG–4  Engineering  and  Logistics  Center  (ELC),  maximum  permissible 
stress  levels  for  the  NSC  were  developed.  The  Coast  Guard  and  Integrated  Coast 
Guard Systems (ICGS) developed a technical solution to structurally enhance NSC’s 
3–8  prior  to  production  award  based  on  those  maximum  permissible  stress  levels. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN 

Question  1.  What  percentage  of  the  current  Deepwater  mission  is  covered  by  the 
110′  patrol  craft?  Can  you  describe  the  tempo  under  which  these  boats  have  been 
operating and their performance? 
Answer.  The  stateside  110′  WPBs  contribute  30  percent  of  the  total  performed 
Deepwater patrol hours in 2006. If the Operation Iraqi Freedom vessels are also in-
cluded  in  total  patrol  boat  hours  then  the  110′  WPB  fleet  contributed  38  percent 
of  the  total  performed  patrol  hours  in  2006.  However,  the  percentage  of  hours  per-
formed is not equivalent to the percentage of the Deepwater mission. The 110′ WPB 
platform  is  not  ideal  for  execution  of  all  missions.  While  a  capable  interceptor  and 
pursuit  vessel  the  110′  WPB  is  limited  in  communications,  range,  endurance,  and 
small boat launch capability. 
For  patrol  boats,  the  Coast  Guard  defines  operational  tempo  as  programmed  pa-
trol  hours.  Within  the  110′  WPB  fleet,  there  are  three  optempo  levels:  stateside 
without a designated Maintenance Augmentation Team (MAT), stateside with a des-
ignated  MAT,  and  those  that  operate  in  support  of  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom.  Pro-
grammed optempo ceilings/targets for these vessels are: 

• Stateside without dedicated MAT support—1,800 hours/year 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

108 

• Stateside with dedicated MAT support—2,200 hours/year 
• In support of Iraqi Freedom—no programmed hour ceiling* 
The percent completion of programmed hours is a good general assessment of 110′ 
patrol  boat  performance.  On  average  in  2006,  stateside  110′  WPBs  achieved  91.4 
percent of their combined 69,300 programmed hours. 

Question  2.  I  mentioned  this  issue  at  the  hearing,  but  you  said  that  you  needed 
to reply for the record. Were you or other senior leadership of the Coast Guard made 
aware  of  a  proposal  from  years  ago  to  provide  a  new  hull,  instead  of  only  partially 
repairs to the hull, for the 110′ to 123′ conversion for $1 million more per copy? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  was  aware  of  one  informal  presentation  by  Bollinger 
Shipyard,  Inc.  (BSI)  to  Vice  Admiral  Peterman  (then  RADM  Peterman,  Seventh 
Coast  Guard  District  Commander)  in  August  2004.  Additionally,  Integrated  Coast 
Guard  Systems  (ICGS)  made  an  informal  presentation  to  the  then-Commandant 
(ADM  Collins)  in  September  2004.  Both  of  these  informal  presentations  involved 
completely  replacing  the  metal  hull  of  the  123′  instead  of  only  replacing  a  portion 
of  the  hull.  The  Coast  Guard  did  a  preliminary  review  based  on  the  very  limited 
information presented, but was hindered by a lack of information on the engineering 
approach,  including  no  written  cost  information  (only  verbal  estimates  were  pro-
vided). 

Based  on  that  situation,  the  Coast  Guard  verbally  responded  that  the  risk  of  so 
many  unknowns  did  not  allow  the  Coast  Guard  to  make  any  decision  on  the  value 
of this approach. BSI and ICGS were advised that if this approach truly had merit, 
then  an  ‘‘Unsolicited  Proposal’’  in  accordance  with  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regula-
tions  should  be  sent  to  the  Coast  Guard.  Neither  firm  submitted  an  ‘‘Unsolicited 
Proposal.’’ 

Question 3. What factors caused the Coast Guard to not accept this proposal? 
Answer. The Coast Guard did a preliminary review based on the very limited in-
formation presented. The preliminary review was hindered by a lack of information 
on the engineering approach, including no written cost information (only verbal cost 
estimates were provided). 

Based  on  that  situation,  the  Coast  Guard  verbally  responded  that  the  risk  of  so 
many  unknowns  did  not  allow  the  Coast  Guard  to  make  any  decision  on  the  value 
of  this  approach.  Bollinger  Shipyards,  Inc.  and  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems 
were  advised  that  if  this  approach  truly  had  merit,  then  an  ‘‘Unsolicited  Proposal’’ 
in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations should be sent to the Coast 
Guard. Neither firm submitted an ‘‘Unsolicited Proposal.’’ 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

RICHARD L. SKINNER 

Question  1.  Do  the  findings  of  the  Defense  Acquisition  University  confirm  the 
findings  of  your  various  studies  that  there  are  some  recurring,  programmatic  prob-
lems with Deepwater that are bigger than problems with specific assets? 

Answer. Yes 
Question 2. Can you explain why your office concluded that the NSC was required 
to  meet  a  performance  standard  of  230  days  underway,  and  why  there  seems  to  be 
so much disagreement about this finding? 

Answer.  Interviews  with  Coast  Guard  contracting  personnel  and  subject  matter 
experts and independent contractors (i.e., Silski, Scott, and the U.S. Navy’s Surface 
Warfare Center—Carderock) all told us that the understanding of everyone involved 
was the 230 day underway at sea versus the Days Away From Home Port (DAFHP) 
standard  as  is  now  claimed  by  the  Coast  Guard.  It  should  be  noted  that  our  inter-
views were conducted with CG personnel that were involved with the drafting of the 
original  performance  standard.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  DAFHP  standard 
is  a  crew  management  standard—not  a  cutter  performance  standard.  The  Coast 
Guard has yet to provide documentary evidence to support their DAFHP contention. 
The Coast Guard, in amending the Deepwater contract to reflect the lower 185 days 
underway standard, gave away an important and valuable capability that will nega-
tively affect the operational capability of the NSC and the OPC. 

Question 3. Isn’t it more than just a little troubling that the Coast Guard is rein-

terpreting the contract’s requirements? What are the implications of this? 

*Note:  110′  WPBs  operating  in  support  of  Iraqi  Freedom  average  3,683  hours  annually  per 

hull.

Answer.  Our  NSC  report  documented  the  difficulty  we  had  obtaining  access  to 
contractor  personnel  and  information.  It  was  because  of  this  problem  that  we  rec-
ommended the Coast Guard amend the Deepwater contract to allow the OIG unfet-
tered  access  to  all  contract  personnel,  documents,  and  information  associated  with 
the Deepwater contract. 

Question 5. Mr. Skinner, the report from your office describes significant problems 
with access to Coast Guard documents and personnel during the investigation. I un-
derstand  from  staff  discussions  with  your  office  that  the  problems  arose  when  your 
staff  sought  to  talk  to  the  Coast  Guard’s  Engineering  and  Logistics  Center—the 
Coast Guards own expert engineers. Is this the case? 

Answer. That is correct. In fact, these access issues caused the NSC to shut down 
its  audit  for  a  period  of  5  weeks  while  we  negotiated  an  agreement  to  have  unfet-
tered access to ELC personnel. Since then, we have made a concerted effort to con-
vince the Coast Guard and the Department to enforce the IG Act of 1978 and DHS 
MD 0810.1 which clearly provide the OIG with the authority to have unfettered ac-
cess  to  Department  personnel  including  those  employed  or  contracted  by  the  Coast 
Guard. I would also point out that similar access issues have been encountered with 
TSA, CBP, and ICE. Once again, it was because of these types of access issues that 
we recommended the Department require all contracts within the Department to in-
clude  a  clause  which  clearly  allows  the  OIG  unfettered  access  to  all  DHS  contract 
personnel, documents, and information, including the Deepwater contract.

Question 1. Mr. Skinner, in conducting the audits on the National Security Cutter, 
the C4ISR systems, and the 110-foot conversion project, what were some of the more 
systemic, broad problems that you found with the Deepwater program and its man-
agement? 

Answer. Some of the systemic problems identified with the Deepwater contract in-

clude: 

109 

Answer.  Defining  the  standard  to  what  an  asset  can  do  rather  than  what  the 
Coast Guard needs the asset to do is a disturbing trend within the Deepwater Pro-
gram, which needs to end. 

Question  4.  The  NSC  report  has  virtually  no  information  about  ICGS.  Why  is 

that? 

the Deepwater contract. 

• Coast Guard’s failure to exercise an appropriate level of technical oversight over 
• Coast  Guard’s  willingness  to  amend  asset  performance  requirements  to  meet 
• Coast Guard’s failure to develop and document the business case underlying key 
Deepwater  decisions  including  the  decision  to  go  ahead  with  NSC  production 
against the written advice of the Coast Guard’s subject matter experts.

• Insufficient C4ISR funding has restricted accomplishing the ‘‘system-of-systems’’ 
objectives that are considered fundamental to Deepwater asset interoperability. 
Question  2.  What  are  some  of  the  top  action  items  that  the  Coast  Guard  should 

be taking to ensure that this program gets back on track? 

Answer. There are a number actions being contemplated and implemented which 
should  greatly  improve  the  Coast  Guard’s  management  of  the  Deepwater  Program. 
They include: 

• Implementing each of the recommendations contained in the DAU Study; 
• Reassert technical oversight and control over the Deepwater contract; 
• Accelerate the hiring of trained and certified civilian acquisition specialists; 
• Ensure unfettered OIG access to contractor personnel, documents, and informa-

• Postpone  construction  of  NSCs  3–8  until  a  mitigation  plan  to  address  all  NSC 

structural deficiencies is fully developed and independently evaluated; and 

• Postpone  construction  of  the  FRC  until  after  a  design  has  been  independently 

evaluated by an independent third party. 

Question  3.  Are  there  any  recommendations  in  your  reports  that  would  require 

legislation? 

Answer. Not at this time.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

RICHARD L. SKINNER 

Question  1.  Over  the  past  2  months,  The  New  York  Times  and  The  Washington 
Post have run scathing articles detailing the mismanagement of the Deepwater con-
tract.  The  Times  quoted  a  Coast  Guard  engineer,  Anthony  D’Armiento,  as  saying: 
‘‘This is the fleecing of America. It is the worst contract arrangement I’ve seen in my 
20  plus  years  in  naval  engineering.’’  I  believe  the  Coast  Guard  should  drop  its  con-
tractors,  solicit  new  contractors  through  an  open  and  competitive  bidding  process, 
and assert firm control over every important managerial decision. Do you agree? 

Answer.  That  is  one  alternative.  However,  we  believe  the  Coast  Guard  can  sal-
vage  the  program  if  they  move  quickly  to  gain  control  over  the  existing  contract. 

Question 2. If not, what is the alternative? 
Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  is  in  the  process  of  initiating  a  major  reorganization 
of its Acquisition Directorate and Deepwater Acquisition Program. As far as the re-
organization  of  the  Deepwater  Program  is  concerned,  the  Coast  Guard  has  stated 
that it is committed to: 

• implementing each of the recommendations contained in the DAU Study; 
• asserting technical oversight and control over the Deepwater contract; 
• improving management accountability by requiring the development of business 

case analyses in support of key Deepwater acquisition decisions; 

• removing the H.60 clause which allows ICGS to be reimbursed for the expenses 

associated with contract delays; 

• amending  the  Deepwater  contract  to  include  off  ramps,  improve  competition, 

and eliminate self-certification by contractors; 

• accelerating the hiring of trained, experienced, and certified civilian acquisition 

specialists; 

mation; 

• ensuring  unfettered  OIG  access  to  contractor  personnel,  documents,  and  infor-

• developing a plan to eliminate the structural design issues with NSCs 1–2; 
• postponing construction of NSCs 3–8 until a mitigation plan to address all NSC 
structural  deficiencies  is  fully-developed,  independently  evaluated,  and  funded; 
and 

• postponing  construction  of  the  FRC  until  after  a  design  has  been  evaluated  by 

an independent third party. 

If  fully-implemented,  the  aforementioned  changes  should  significantly  improve 
managerial  accountability  and  control,  reduce  acquisition  costs  through  increased 
competition,  and  enhance  the  safety  and  mission  capability  of  Deepwater  mission 
assets.

Question  3.  Do  you  believe  that  Lockheed  and  Northrop  made  management  and 
purchasing  decisions  that  increased  their  bottom  line  at  the  expense  of  efficiency 
and concern for the taxpayer? 

water have compromised national security? 

Answer. I do not know. 
Question 4. Do you believe that the delays and management problems with Deep-
Answer. Yes, in the sense that the design problems with the 110′–123′ Moderniza-
tion project, the suspension of the FRC design effort; and the structural design and 
safety  issues  associated  with  the  NSC  have  delayed  the  deployment  of  Deepwater 
assets  that  are  critical  to  maritime  security.  It  has  also  cost  taxpayers  hundreds  of 
millions of dollars that could have been better spent on additional aircraft and cut-
ters  to  further  improve  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  perform  its  Deepwater  and 
Ports and Waterways Coastal Security missions. 

Question  5.  Does  the  Deepwater  contract  allow  the  government  to  recoup  funds 
stemming  from  design  flaws  for  the  cutters  and  patrol  boats  that  will  have  to  be 
fixed? Who pays for that? 

Answer. The Department is looking into this very issue. The initial indications are 
that  the  Coast  Guard  (and  American  taxpayers)  will  end  up  footing  the  bill  for  the 
123′ FRC and NSC design fiascos. 

Question  6.  Mr.  Skinner,  Mr.  Caldwell—both  your  offices  have  issued  various  re-
ports on Deepwater and made recommendations to improve the program. The GAO 
made  11  recommendations  to  the  Coast  Guard  in  2004  ranging  from  implementing 
a  plan  to  increase  acquisition  staff  and  oversight  to  establishing  criteria  to  justify 
design  and  engineering  changes.  Some  of  these  have  been  implemented,  some 
haven’t. 

These recommendations are good. But at the same time, aren’t they just tiptoeing 

around the fact the contract structure is fundamentally flawed? 

Answer.  The  contract  that  was  signed  was  flawed,  however,  Coast  Guard  has  re-

cently identified steps to gain control over the contract. 

Question 7. Would you agree that, 9/11 notwithstanding that the main reason for 
the delays and cost overruns with Deepwater stem from the unusual contracting ar-
rangement that empowered the contractors to take matters into their own hands as 
well as the Coast Guard’s inability to assert control over the program? 

Answer. Yes. 
Question  8.  Do  you  believe  costs  could  be  contained  and  that  Deepwater  could  be 
completed earlier than expected if the Coast Guard decided against extending Lock-
heed’s  contract  and  instead  found  new  contractors  through  a  competitive  bidding 
process under improved Coast Guard oversight? 

Answer. I cannot say. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. TRENT LOTT TO 

RICHARD L. SKINNER 

Question.  Please  describe  the  ship  design  and  construction  expertise  of  your  staff 

and any outside experts you used to analyze the National Security Cutter. 

Answer.  As  I  testified  before  the  Committee  in  the  hearing  held  on  February  14, 
2007, the OIG’s report on the acquisition of the National Security Cutter relied en-
tirely upon the analyses of subject matter experts with over 300 years of experience 
as structural naval architects and professional engineers. Further, these individuals 
are  internationally  renowned  as  leaders  in  their  field  with  numerous  publications 
and ship design and construction industry honors to their credit. 

For  example,  the  Coast  Guard’s  subject  matter  experts  assigned  to  the  Coast 
Guard’s  Engineering  Logistics  Command  (ELC)  who  initially  identified  the  struc-
tural  design  issues  associated  with  the  NSC  (Rear  Admiral  E.  Brown,  Captain  K. 
Jarvis,  R.  Sheinberg,  C.  Cleary,  K.  Brower,  Dr.  A.L.  Tunik,  and  P.  Hirsimaki  have 
collectively,  more  than  252  years  of  ship  design  and  construction  experience.  When 
you  add  the  experience  of  Robert  Sielski,  Robert  Scott,  and  Dr.  David  Kihl  and  his 
staff  at  Carderock,  the  experience  level  is  even  higher.  All  of  these  individuals  are 
of  international  renown  in  their  respective  fields.  Consequently,  it  should  not  be  a 
surprise  that  their  conclusions  were  similar  in  substance  to  those  reported  by  the 
ELC back in March 2004. Subject matter experts include: 

Rear  Admiral  Erroll  Brown  (USCG  Retired)—33  years  experience—Rear  Adm. 
Brown  graduated  from  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Academy  in  1972.  He  majored  in  Ma-
rine Engineering and has a Masters degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engi-
neering,  with  a  second  Masters  in  Industrial  and  Operations  Engineering  from  the 
University of Michigan.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

RICHARD L. SKINNER 

Question  1.  The  DHS  Office  of  Inspector  General  is  currently  putting  the  final 
touches  on  a  report  regarding  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  (DHS  OIG–07–23).  In  the 
course  of  that  investigation,  did  you  find  any  indications  that  the  Coast  Guard  is 
making progress with its oversight responsibilities? 

Answer.  Our  Office  has  identified  a  number  of  systemic  problems  with  the  Deep-
water  Program,  and  has  made  numerous  recommendations,  that,  if  implemented, 
will  greatly  improve  oversight  of  the  program.  Thus  far,  our  Office  has  issued  the 
following three reports associated with the acquisition of Deepwater assets/systems: 
Improvements  Needed  in  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard’s  Acquisition  and  Implementa-
tion of Deepwater Information Technology Systems (OIG–06–55) 
Acquisition  of  the  National  Security  Cutter,  United  States  Coast  Guard  (OIG– 
07–27) 
110′/123′  Maritime  Patrol  Boat  Modernization  Project,  United  States  Coast 
Guard (OIG–07–23). 

These  reports  identified  a  number  of  systemic  problems  with  the  Deepwater  Pro-

gram contract, including, Coast Guard’s: 

water contract; 

rather than Coast Guard mission needs; 

• failure  to  exercise  an  appropriate  level  of  technical  oversight  over  the  Deep-
• willingness to amend asset performance requirements to meet asset capabilities 
• failure  to  develop  and  document  the  business  case  underlying  key  Deepwater 
decisions  including  the  decision  to  go  ahead  with  NSC  production  against  the 
written advice of the Coast Guard’s subject matter experts; 
• willingness  to  issue  waivers  for  critical  equipment  and  C4ISR  system  installa-
tions  (i.e.,  installation  of  low  smoke  cables  and  the  installation  of  topside  navi-
gation  and  communications  equipment  on  the  123-foot  patrol  boat)  with  the 
knowledge  that  the  equipment/systems  did  not  meet  minimum  contract  per-
formance requirements; and 
• ill-defined  performance  requirements  for  the  National  Security  Cutter  and  the 
110′/123′ patrol boat modernization project; 

And,

114 

• contractor  willingness  to  install  equipment  and  systems  that  do  not  meet  min-
• self-certification performed, not by an independent third party, but by the Deep-

imum contract requirements; and 

water contractor or sub-contractor. 

These issues were prominent topics of discussion between my staff and the Coast 
Guard  over  the  course  of  these  three  audits.  However,  it  was  not  until  after  the 
most  recent  reports  on  the  National  Security  Cutter  and  the  123-foot  Patrol  Boat 
were issued did the Coast Guard begin to acknowledge the magnitude of the mana-
gerial  and  technical  oversight  issues  impacting  their  Acquisitions  Directorate  in 
general, and the Deepwater Program in particular. 

The  recently  issued  Blueprint  for  Acquisition  Reform  in  the  Coast  Guard  (Blue-
print) is an honest attempt by the Coast Guard to review lessons learned from past 
acquisitions and evaluate input from the Defense Acquisition University (and other 
independent sources) to identify specific issues that have impeded the efficient exe-
cution  of  past  acquisition  projects.  The  Blueprint  contains  a  number  of  initiatives, 
which,  if  fully  implanted,  should  improve  the  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and  economy 
of future Coast Guard acquisitions. While the Blueprint includes a number of initia-
tives,  few  if  any  have  been  implemented.  Consequently,  it  remains  to  be  seen  ex-
actly how effective it will be. 

OIG strongly recommends the Coast Guard implement the following corrective ac-

tions as they consider any reorganization of Deepwater acquisitions, including: 

specialists; 

quisition University study; 

associated with contract delays; 

and eliminate self-certification by contractors; 

case analyses in support of key Deepwater acquisition decisions; 

• implementing  each  of  the  recommendations  contained  in  a  recent  Defense  Ac-
• asserting technical oversight and control over the Deepwater contract; 
• improving management accountability by requiring the development of business 
• removing the H.60 clause which allows ICGS to be reimbursed for the expenses 
• amending  the  Deepwater  contract  to  include  off  ramps,  improve  competition, 
• accelerating the hiring of trained, experienced, and certified civilian acquisition 
• ensuring  unfettered  OIG  access  to  Coast  Guard  and  contractor  and  subcon-
• developing a plan to eliminate the structural design issues with NSC’s 1–2; 
• postponing construction of NSC’s 3–8 until a mitigation plan to address all NSC 
structural  deficiencies  is  fully-developed,  independently  evaluated,  and  funded; 
• ensuring  the  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC  and  OPC  meet  the  230  days  underway  (in 
the General Atlantic and North Pacific regions) standard as stated in the origi-
nal Deepwater contract; and 
• postponing  construction  of  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  until  after  the  design  has 
been  evaluated  by  an  independent  third  party  (i.e.,  the  U.S.  Navy’s  Surface 
Warfare Center—Carderock Division). 

tractor personnel, documents, and information; 

Deepwater technical requirements; 

If these corrective actions are fully implemented, these changes would: 
• improve managerial and contractor accountability; 
• reassert  Coast  Guard  dominance  over  the  development  and  implementation  of 
• reduce Deepwater acquisition costs through increased competition; 
• increase the level of transparency surrounding key Deepwater decisions; and 
• enhance the safety and mission capability of Deepwater mission assets. 
Question 2. The DHS OIG Report on the Acquisition of the National Security Cut-
ter states the Coast Guard allowed the Contractor to self-certify compliance with the 
standards.  In  the  footnotes  of  the  report  (page  14),  the  Deepwater  Surface  State-
ment  of  Objectives  state,  ‘‘. . .  performance  specification  and  cutter  specific  certifi-
cation  matrix  are  certified  either  by  self-certification  or  by  an  independent  agent, 
except  that  the  contractor  shall  use  American  Bureau  of  Shipping  (ABS)  to  certify 
compliance  with  ABS  standards.’’  What  are  the  practical  differences  and  implica-
tions  between  ABS  certification  and  ‘‘self-certification’’  with  ABS  certifying  compli-
ance with ABS standards? 

Answer.  The  practical  difference  between  certifications  performed  by  the  Amer-
ican  Bureau  of  Shipping  (ABS)  and  ‘‘self-certifications’’  performed  by  ICGS  is  that 
certifications performed by ABS represent an independent evaluation of the contrac-

tor’s compliance with the design and construction standards identified in the Deep-
water  contract.  According  to  the  Deepwater  contract,  ‘‘The  role  of  the  certification 
agent is to serve as an independent agent who verifies that the contractor has dem-
onstrated compliance with the applicable standards.’’ 

Background—In June 1999, the Coast Guard and the ABS signed a Memorandum 
of  Agreement  (MOA)  to  jointly  develop  a  Cutter  Certification  Plan  that  included 
1,175  individual  standards  intended  to  govern  the  design,  construction,  and  certifi-
cation  of  all  cutters  acquired  under  the  Deepwater  Program.  These  standards  were 
identified to ensure that the bidding industry teams’ proposed cutter designs would 
result in vessels that met the Coast Guard’s unique safety and operational require-
ments.  The  ABS  is  one  of  ten  organizations  that  belongs  to  the  International  Asso-
ciation  of  Classification  Societies  whose  responsibilities  include  the  establishment 
and  application  of  technical  standards  related  to  the  design,  construction  of  ships 
and  offshore  structures.  The  standards  developed  by  the  classification  societies  are 
intended  to  contribute  to  the  structural  strength  and  integrity  of  essential  parts  of 
the ships hull and its appendages. As an independent, self-regulating body, ABS has 
no commercial interest related to ship design, ship building, or ship operations and 
therefore does not suffer impairments that would prevent it from serving as an inde-
pendent certification agent on behalf of the Coast Guard. 

The joint ABS/Coast Guard Cutter Certification Plan further specified a certifying 
agent for each design standard to ensure that all cutters would be objectively evalu-
ated  for  compliance.  The  MOA  between  ABS  and  Coast  Guard  stipulated  that  ABS 
would  be  the  designated  certification  agent  for  any  ‘‘ABS  standards’’,  i.e.,  modified 
ABS  Rules  applicable  to  the  hull,  mechanical,  and  electrical  areas  of  Coast  Guard 
vessels,  that  were  identified  in  the  Cutter  Certification  Plan.  However,  when  it 
issued its Deepwater Request for Proposal, the Coast Guard allowed the bidding in-
dustry  teams  to  select  alternatives  to  approximately  85  percent  of  the  1,175  joint 
Coast  Guard/ABS  design  and  construction  standards,  and  it  further  permitted  in-
dustry  to  select  the  certifying  entity  for  any  non-ABS  design  standards  that  were 
selected as alternatives to the originals. In submitting its Deepwater proposal, ICGS 
elected  to  self-certify  its  compliance  with  all  of  the  alternatives  it  was  permitted  to 
select for any non-ABS design standards. 

Implications—The Coast Guard’s decision to allow the Deepwater contract bidders 
to  deviate  from  joint  ABS/Coast  Guard  Cutter  Certification  Plan  without  Coast 
Guard approval gave the selected systems integrator, ultimately ICGS, wide latitude 
in  developing  the  designs  for  all  cutters  to  be  acquired  under  Deepwater,  including 
the  National  Security  Cutter,  and  the  Fast  Response  Cutters.  The  decision  also  in-
creased the risk that bidders could select potentially ill-defined or inappropriate cut-
ter  design  criteria  that  could  be  inconsistent  with  the  original  intent  of  the  MOA. 
Further,  by  allowing  the  systems  integrator  the  authority  to  self-certify  its  compli-
ance  with  most  design  standards,  the  Coast  Guard  eliminated  a  key  oversight  tool 
for  ensuring  that  cutter  designs  developed  under  the  Deepwater  contract  met  both 
contractual and Deepwater mission performance requirements. For example, our re-
view,  ‘‘110′/123′  Maritime  Patrol  Boat  Modernization  Project’’  (OIG–07–23),  high-
lighted the flaws associated with the concept of contractor self-certification with de-
sign  standards.  In  two  instances,  ICGS  certified  compliance  with  the  design  stand-
ards when in fact the actual construction of the 123′ patrol boat was not compliant 
with the standards identified in the certification plan. 

In our report, ‘‘Acquisition of the National Security Cutter’’ (DHS OIG–07–23), we 
discussed  the  inability  of  OIG  auditors  to  obtain  unfettered  access  to  Coast  Guard 
and  contractor  personnel,  documents,  and  information.  This  was  an  unprecedented 
situation  that  was  contrary  to  Federal  statute  and  Department  directive.  In  its  re-
sponse  to  the  NSC  report,  the  Coast  Guard  stated  that  the  Department  is  working 
to promulgate Department-wide guidance on dealing with the DHS Office of Inspec-
tor General. We look forward to resolving this issue in the near future. 

Question  3.  In  the  DHS  OIG  Report  on  the  Acquisition  of  the  National  Security 
Cutter (DHS OIG–07–23), the OIG reports considerable concern with the difficulties 
encountered  trying  to  obtain  access  and  information  from  the  Coast  Guard  and 
ICGS.  In  its  response,  the  Coast  Guard  stated  that  the  Department  is  working  to 
promulgate Department-wide guidance on dealing with the DHS Office of Inspector 
General.  What  is  the  status  on  the  DHS  OIG  memo  to  the  Secretary  outlining  De-
partment-wide policy concerning agency cooperation with the DHS IG? 

Answer. As discussed in our report, we provided a one-page memorandum for the 
Secretary’s  signature  identifying  our  authorities,  and  a  four-page  document  pro-
viding Frequently Asked Questions regarding interactions with our auditors and in-
spectors,  to  be  issued  to  all  Department  of  Homeland  Security  personnel.  We  are 
aware  of  no  activity  by  the  department  with  respect  to  either  document  as  of  the 
date of the hearing.

Question 3a. Has the DHS OIG faced similar problems with Coast Guard coopera-

tion in previous or currently ongoing audits? 

Answer.  Yes.  During  the  OIG’s  review  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  Helicopter  Interdic-
tion  Squadron  Lease  and  the  HH–65  Re-engining  Project.  The  HITRON  audit  was 
not completed due to competing priorities within the OIG, Office of Audits, and the 
delays  resulting  from  the  inability  of  staff  to  obtain  timely  and  unfettered  access 
to  Coast  Guard  and  contractor  personnel,  documents,  and  information.  As  a  result, 
events overtook the audit as problems with the leased helicopter (the MH–68) were 
eventually resolved and the Coast Guard moved ahead with its HH–65 Re-engining 
Project.  The  Coast  Guard  intends  to  replace  the  MH–68  helicopter  with  tan  AUF 
version of the HH–65C and terminate its HITRON lease during January 2008. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

RICHARD L. SKINNER 

Question  1.  You  indicated  that  you  received  a  ‘‘Hotline  Complaint’’  regarding  the 
110′/123′  conversion.  Did  this  complaint  include  any  allegations  regarding  the  hull 
or structure of the vessel? 

Answer. No. 
Question 2. Do you believe that the current ‘‘bridge strategy’’ for the coastal patrol 

boats is adequate to fulfill the demands of this workhorse? 

Answer.  No.  The  Coast  Guard  needs  to  replace  its  aging  and  deteriorating  fleet 
of Island Class patrol boats as soon as possible. The Coast Guard’s March 14, 2007, 
decision  to  build  the  Fast  Response  Cutter-B,  outside  of  the  Deepwater  program  is 
a good first step in resolving the Coast Guard’s ever-expanding patrol boat gap. The 
Coast  Guard  could  further  close  the  patrol  boat  capability  gap  if  it  would  agree  to 
built  the  Fast  Response  Cutter-B  at  more  than  one  shipyard.  Building  the  cutter 
at more than one shipyard would: 

round of Fast Response Cutters (FRC) to be built; 

• expand  the  competition  (and  the  potential  savings)  associated  with  the  next 
• expedite the deployment of the FRC and hasten the end to the patrol boat gap; 
• hasten  the  retirement  (and  the  expense)  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  Is-

and 

land Class fleet. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

STEPHEN L. CALDWELL 

Question  1.  Do  the  findings  of  the  Defense  Acquisition  University  confirm  the 
findings  of  your  various  studies  that  there  are  some  recurring,  programmatic  prob-
lems with Deepwater that are bigger than problems with specific assets? 

Answer.  Yes,  the  Defense  Acquisition  University  (DAU)  findings  are  similar  to 
and confirm many of the issues we have identified in the past. In 2004 and in subse-
quent  assessments  in  2005  and  2006,  we  reported  concerns  about  the  Deepwater 
program in three main areas—improving program management, strengthening con-
tractor  accountability,  and  promoting  cost  control  through  greater  competition 
among potential subcontractors. In its recent study, DAU echoed some of these same 
concerns. For example, the report notes that the Coast Guard has insufficient num-
ber  of  acquisitions  personnel  and  insufficient  experience  in  major  systems  acquisi-
tion,  and  lacks  a  management  model  and  processes  sufficient  for  the  management 
and oversight of the Deepwater major systems acquisitions. These broader concerns, 
as  well  as  others  DAU  raised,  go  beyond  the  specific  problems  at  the  asset  level. 
Question  2.  Your  testimony  finds  that  there  is  an  inherent  conflict  of  interest  in 
giving private industry so much control over a government contract. You state that 
‘‘Giving contractors more control and influence over the government’s acquisition in 
a  systems  integrator  role  creates  a  potential  risk  that  program  decisions  and  prod-
ucts  could  be  influenced  by  the  financial  interest  of  the  contractor—which  is  ac-
countable to its shareholders—which may not match the primary interest of the gov-
ernment,  maximizing  its  return  on  taxpayer  dollars.’’  Doesn’t  this  risk  grow  when 
we  are  talking  about  such  a  long-term,  open-ended  contract  as  we  have  here  with 
the Deepwater program? 

Answer.  The  Deepwater  contract  is  an  Indefinite  Delivery/Indefinite  Quantity 
(IDIQ) contract. Generally an IDIQ contract is not the type of contract in which the 
government’s  risks  are  open-ended.  Under  an  IDIQ  contract  the  government  orders 
supplies or services when needed. The government can limit the amount of supplies

117 

or services it orders by minimizing the number of task or delivery orders it creates. 
The  inherent  conflict  of  interest  in  giving  private  industry  increased  control  over  a 
government  contract  is  one  example  of  a  conflict.  Conflicts  of  interests  may  arise 
in  many  contexts.  Management  controls  and  contract  clauses  may  be  implemented 
to minimize the risk of conflicts to the government. 

Question  3.  GAO  was  the  first  entity  to  warn  of  risks  inherent  in  the  Deepwater 
contract  approach.  A  top  concern  was  the  lack  of  competition  required.  GAO  found 
that the Deepwater contract gives sole authority to the industry contractor to deter-
mine  whether  to  ‘‘make-or-buy’’  assets,  and  whether  to  hold  open  competition  for 
subcontracts. How have these concerns been borne out? 

Answer.  We  have  noted  in  our  past  work  that  the  Coast  Guard’s  hands-off  ap-
proach  to  make-or-buy  decisions  and  its  failure  to  assess  the  extent  of  competition 
raised questions about whether the government would be able to control Deepwater 
program costs. While the Coast Guard has now taken steps to establish a reporting 
requirement  for  the  systems  integrator  to  provide  information  on  competition  on  a 
semi-annual  basis,  the  Coast  Guard  is  currently  planning  to  procure  remaining 
short-range  prosecutor  vessels  outside  of  the  systems  integrator  contract.  By  doing 
so,  the  Coast  Guard  expects  to  achieve  cost  savings.  We  will  continue  to  assess  the 
Coast  Guard’s  efforts  to  hold  the  systems  integrator  accountable  for  ensuring  an 
adequate degree of competition. 

Question  4.  Given  the  open-ended  nature  of  this  kind  of  contract,  where  Coast 
Guard merely defined its needs and ICGS develops assets to meet them, isn’t a cost- 
plus arrangement particularly risky? 

Answer.  Cost  reimbursement  orders  issued  under  IDIQ  contracts,  like  some  of 
those issued under the Deepwater contract, are designed to be used when there are 
uncertainties  in  contract  performance  which  do  not  permit  costs  to  be  estimated 
with  sufficient  accuracy  to  use  any  type  of  fixed-price  order.  In  the  Coast  Guard’s 
case,  use  of  performance-based,  cost  reimbursement  orders,  in  which  the  Coast 
Guard  defines  a  need  and  asks  the  contractor  to  develop  an  asset  that  meets  its 
need  may  be  an  appropriate  response.  The  questions  that  help  identify  risk  to  the 
government  include:  (1)  How  well  established  are  the  government’s  requirements? 
and (2) How well has the government managed and supervised the contractor’s per-
formance? 

Question 5. Last year, GAO brought to our attention problems with the design of 
the  Fast  Response  Cutter.  In  the  course  of  your  audit,  did  you  reach  a  conclusion 
as to what led the Coast Guard to the situation they now find themselves in? 

Answer.  We  did  not  reach  any  conclusions  as  to  the  root  cause(s)  for  the  suspen-
sion  of  FRC  design  work.  As  we  reported,  the  Coast  Guard  suspended  FRC  design 
work in February 2006 due to high technical risks with the emerging design. In par-
ticular, an independent design review by third-party consultants preliminarily dem-
onstrated, among other things, that the FRC would be far heavier and less efficient 
than  a  typical  patrol  boat  of  similar  length.  We  did  note  that  this  review  validated 
some  concerns  that  had  been  raised  by  the  Coast  Guard’s  Engineering  Logistics 
Center over 1 year prior. 

Question  6.  Based  on  your  June  2006  audit  of  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  procure-
ment  program,  how  much  money  has  been  invested  in  the  design  and  analysis  of 
the composite Fast Response Cutter? 

Answer.  As  we  reported,  as  of  May  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  had  spent  approxi-
mately  $26.7  million  on  design  and  test  efforts.  We  have  not  conducted  any  addi-
tional  analysis  to  determine  how  much  has  been  spent  on  these  efforts  since  that 
time. 

Question  7.  At  present,  does  the  Coast  Guard  or  the  American  people  have  any-

thing to show for that investment? 

Answer. The Coast Guard had planned to accept the first FRC in 2007; however, 
the  Coast  Guard’s  decision  to  suspend  design  work  in  late  February  2006  has  pre-
cluded that from occurring. Since the design suspension, the Coast Guard has begun 
to re-evaluate the use of a composite hull material for a newly-designed FRC (FRC– 
A). The Coast Guard has commissioned a business case analysis comparing the use 
of composite versus steel hulls and the Department of Homeland Security’s Science 
and  Technology  Directorate  will  be  conducting  tests  on  composite  hull  technology. 
In  the  interim,  the  Coast  Guard  is  planning  to  acquire  a  commercial  ‘‘off-the-shelf’’ 
patrol boat design that can be adapted for Coast Guard use (FRC–B) and is working 
toward having the first FRC–B delivered in 2010. While there is not much tangible 
to  show  for  the  money  invested  in  the  FRC  program  to  date,  we  know  there  have 
been lessons learned and are encouraged by the Commandant’s recent pledge to: (a) 
reaffirm the role of the Coast Guard’s Chief Engineer as the technical authority for 
all  acquisition  projects;  (b)  employ  independent,  third-party  design  reviews  as  new 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00121 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

assets  are  developed  or  major  modifications  are  contemplated;  and  (c)  cultivate  a 
more  robust  relationship  with  Naval  Sea  and  Air  Systems  Commands  to  leverage 
outside technical expertise. 

Question  8.  In  2004,  GAO  provided  11  recommendations  to  the  Coast  Guard  for 
improving  its  management  of  the  Deepwater  project.  Don’t  several  of  the  open  rec-
ommendations  involve  the  problems  with  the  Integrated  Product  Teams—the  core 
mechanism  for  integrating  the  Coast  Guard’s  experts  and  programs  into  the  Deep-
water process? 

Answer. We believe that effective management of the Deepwater program depends 
heavily on strong collaboration among the Coast Guard, the systems integrator, and 
subcontractors.  The  Integrated  Product  Teams  (IPTs)  are  the  vehicle  used  to  bring 
these  parties  together  and  were  established  as  the  primary  tool  for  managing  the 
Deepwater  program.  While  IPTs  are  an  important  element  of  the  Deepwater  pro-
gram,  only  1  of  the  11  recommendations  we  made  in  2004  pertained  to  the  IPTs. 
Specifically,  we  recommended  that  the  Coast  Guard  strengthen  the  IPTs  by  pro-
viding them better training, approving charters, and improving systems for sharing 
information  between  teams.  The  Coast  Guard  has  undertaken  some  efforts  to  ad-
dress  these  problems  and  we  will  continue  to  monitor  the  Coast  Guard’s  progress 
at addressing this recommendation. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

STEPHEN L. CALDWELL 

Question 1. Mr. Caldwell, do you agree that eight of the eleven recommendations 
that GAO provided to the Coast Guard back in 2004 for improving Deepwater over-
sight, have been fully implemented, and only three remain outstanding? 

Answer.  In  April  2006,  we  reported  that  of  the  11  recommendations  we  made  in 
2004,  only  5  had  been  implemented.  The  Coast  Guard  does  not  plan  to  implement 
one  of  the  recommendations,  pertaining  to  establishing  a  baseline  to  determine 
whether  the  acquisition  approach  is  costing  the  government  more  than  the  tradi-
tional  asset  replacement  approach.  We  reported  in  2006  that  the  5  remaining  rec-
ommendations had been only partially implemented. These are: 

• Improve  integrated  product  teams  responsible  for  managing  the  program  by 
providing  better  training,  approving  charters,  and  improving  systems  for  shar-
ing information between teams. 

• Provide  field  personnel  with  guidance  and  training  on  transitioning  to  the  new 

Deepwater assets. 

• Establish  a  timeframe  for  putting  steps  in  place  to  measure  contractor’s 

progress toward improving operational effectiveness. 

• Establish  criteria  to  determine  when  to  adjust  the  project  baseline  and  docu-

ment the reasons for change. 

• Develop  a  comprehensive  plan  for  holding  the  systems  integrator  accountable 

for ensuring adequate competition among suppliers. 

We  are  in  the  process  of  assessing  Coast  Guard  actions  in  response  to  our  rec-
ommendations  and  expect  to  report  on  the  results  of  our  analysis  later  this  year. 
Question  2.  How  significant  are  the  three  open  recommendations  to  Coast  Guard 

management of the Deepwater contract? 

Answer. We believe that each of the 5 open recommendations is important to the 
Coast Guard’s ability to manage and oversee the Deepwater contract. They fall into 
three  broad  areas:  effectively  implementing  key  components  of  management  and 
oversight;  improving  contractor  accountability;  and  controlling  costs  through  com-
petition. We will continue to assess the Coast Guard’s progress in our ongoing work. 
Question  3.  The  Defense  Acquisition  University  report  raises  a  much  broader  set 
of  concerns  with  respect  to  the  Deepwater  contract  and  contracting  approach.  Do 
you agree with their findings and recommendations? 

Answer. The DAU study found that some of the causes that have significantly in-
creased  the  risk  of  procuring  the  Deepwater  capabilities  included  insufficient  num-
bers  of  Coast  Guard  acquisition  personnel  and  lack  of  a  management  model  and 
processes  sufficient  for  managing  and  overseeing  this  acquisition.  These  broader 
concerns  go  beyond  the  specific  problems  at  the  asset  level.  We  believe  the  DAU’s 
findings  and  recommendations  will  be  helpful  for  the  Coast  Guard  as  it  moves  for-
ward with the Deepwater acquisition.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

STEPHEN L. CALDWELL 

Question  1.  Over  the  past  2  months,  the  New  York  Times  and  The  Washington 
Post have run scathing articles detailing the mismanagement of the Deepwater con-
tract.  The  Times  quoted  a  Coast  Guard  engineer,  Anthony  D’Armiento,  as  saying: 
‘‘This is the fleecing of America. It is the worst contract arrangement I’ve seen in my 
20  plus  years  in  naval  engineering.’’  I  believe  the  Coast  Guard  should  drop  its  con-
tractors,  solicit  new  contractors  through  an  open  and  competitive  bidding  process, 
and assert firm control over every important managerial decision. Do you agree? 

Answer.  Whether  the  Coast  Guard  terminates  its  contractors  and  makes  award 
to  new  contractors  or  brings  the  work  in-house  will  not  necessarily  produce  a  suc-
cessful  acquisition  result.  Proper  management  attention  will  be  needed  in  any  case 
to obtain a successful acquisition result. That being said, competition is a key com-
ponent  for  controlling  costs.  The  Commandant’s  recent  pledge  to  reaffirm  the  role 
of  the  Coast  Guard’s  Chief  Engineer  as  the  technical  authority  for  all  acquisition 
projects  appears  to  be  designed  to  assert  more  government  control  over  important 
management decisions. 

Question 2. If not, what is the alternative? 
Answer. See the response to Question 1 above. 
Question  3.  Do  you  believe  that  Lockheed  and  Northrop  made  management  and 
purchasing  decisions  that  increased  their  bottom  line  at  the  expense  of  efficiency 
and concern for the taxpayer? 

Answer.  GAO  has  not  done  any  work  to  support  this  conclusion.  What  our  work 
has  indicated  is  that  with  proper  surveillance  and  management  attention,  among 
other factors, contractor efficiency can be increased. 

Question 4. Do you believe that the delays and management problems with Deep-

water have compromised national security? 

Answer.  It  is  true  that  problems  in  fielding  effective  Deepwater  assets  can  have 
an  adverse  impact  on  the  Coast  Guard’s  operational  capabilities.  For  example,  the 
Coast Guard’s decision to remove its eight 123-foot patrol boats from service in No-
vember  2006  after  the  conversion  of  these  vessels  from  110-foot  patrol  boats  failed 
has added to the Coast Guard’s critical gap in patrol hours. To the extent that these 
patrol boats served a variety of missions, their removal from service means that the 
Coast Guard faces greater challenges in meeting these missions, some of which may 
involve national security or homeland security interests. 

Question  5.  Does  the  Deepwater  contract  allow  the  government  to  recoup  funds 
stemming  from  design  flaws  for  the  cutters  and  patrol  boats  that  will  have  to  be 
fixed? Who pays for that? 

Answer.  At  this  time,  we  are  not  aware  of  any  special  clause  in  the  Deepwater 
contract  that  would  allow  the  government  to  recoup  costs  for  design  flaws,  but  we 
are  continuing  to  review  the  contract.  Government  contracts  generally,  and  the 
Deepwater contract specifically, are subject to the Contract Disputes Act. Under the 
Contract  Disputes  Act,  disagreements  over  responsibility  for  contract  performance 
proceed through a disputes process where each party has an opportunity to present 
its  claims  and  arguments  for  resolution.  This  process  is  incorporated  into  the  con-
tract through a disputes clause. These clauses generally only allow for the recovery 
of costs once responsibility for the subject of the disagreement has been determined. 
In addition, while it does not appear the contract addresses cost recoupment specifi-
cally,  the  contract  does  contain  warranty  provisions,  which  if  breached,  permit  the 
government to avail itself of certain remedies. Without special provisions that speak 
to  recoupment,  the  Coast  Guard  and  ICGS  will  have  to  resolve  any  such  disagree-
ments  through  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  disputes  clause  and  process  in-
corporated into the contract. 

Question  6.  Mr.  Skinner,  Mr.  Caldwell—both  your  offices  have  issued  various  re-
ports on Deepwater and made recommendations to improve the program. The GAO 
made  11  recommendations  to  the  Coast  Guard  in  2004  ranging  from  implementing 
a  plan  to  increase  acquisition  staff  and  oversight  to  establishing  criteria  to  justify 
design  and  engineering  changes.  Some  of  these  have  been  implemented,  some 
haven’t.  These  recommendations  are  good.  But  at  the  same  time,  aren’t  they  just 
tiptoeing around the fact the contract structure is fundamentally flawed? 

Answer. As GAO work has indicated in the past, contract management and execu-
tion  have  a  greater  impact  on  the  government’s  risks  than  the  contract  structure. 
Question 7. Would you agree that, 9/11 notwithstanding that the main reason for 
the delays and cost overruns with Deepwater stem from the unusual contracting ar-
rangement that empowered the contractors to take matters into their own hands as 
well as the Coast Guard’s inability to assert control over the program?

120 

Answer.  Our  work  has  shown  that  after  9/11,  the  revisions  to  Deepwater  led  to 
increases  of  $7  billion  in  the  overall  estimates  across  Deepwater  assets.  The  total 
increase—from $17 billion to $24 billion—was largely due to enhanced homeland se-
curity  mission  requirements.  Beyond  that,  GAO  has  not  done  any  work  to  specifi-
cally identify the sources of other cost increases across Deepwater assets, or the ex-
tent that the type of contracting arrangement led to additional costs. In 2004, GAO 
recommended  that  the  Coast  Guard  establish  a  baseline  for  determining  whether 
this acquisition approach is costing the government more than the traditional asset 
replacement  approach,  but  the  Coast  Guard  decided  not  to  implement  this  rec-
ommendation. 

Question  8.  Do  you  believe  costs  could  be  contained  and  that  Deepwater  could  be 
completed earlier than expected if the Coast Guard decided against extending Lock-
heed’s  contract  and  instead  found  new  contractors  through  a  competitive  bidding 
process under improved Coast Guard oversight? 

Answer. Any new contract awarded for the remaining work will more than likely 
have  to  allow  the  new  contractor  to  invoice  the  government  for  its  start-up  costs. 
ICGS may have invoiced similar costs for its own effort. In addition, obtaining com-
petitive offers for an effort of this size may not reduce the time frames for perform-
ance  as  any  competition  takes  time  for  the  government  to  prepare  a  solicitation, 
offerors to prepare responses, and the government to evaluate those responses. Fur-
ther, a new contractor may need time to bring its resources up-to-speed, which may 
include  hiring  new  personnel  or  providing  new  facilities,  in  order  to  respond  to  the 
government’s  needs.  That  being  said,  however,  competition  is  a  key  component  for 
controlling  costs,  and  injecting  more  competition  in  the  Deepwater  program  could 
help contain costs. 

Question  9.  Mr.  Caldwell,  how  many  other  major  Federal  contracts  that  use  the 

Systems Integrator approach are currently in operation? 

Answer.  We  do  not  have  a  precise  number  of  major  Federal  contracts  that  use  a 
systems  integrator  approach.  This  type  of  business  arrangement  can  give  the  con-
tractor  extensive  involvement  in  requirements  development,  design,  and  source  se-
lection  of  major  systems  and  subsystem  contractors.  For  example,  GAO  has  re-
viewed the Army’s Future Combat System (FCS), which employs a lead systems in-
tegrator to assist in defining, developing, and integrating a network of weapons and 
other systems. The Army’s decision to employ a lead systems integrator for the FCS 
program  was  framed  by  two  factors:  (1)  the  ambitious  goals  of  the  FCS  program, 
and  (2)  the  Army’s  capacity  to  manage  it.  A  systems  integrator  has  also  been  em-
ployed by the Department of Homeland Security to help secure U.S. borders and re-
duce illegal immigration under the Secure Border Initiative (SBI). 

Question  10.  Was  there  a  comparable  military  contract  that  the  Coast  Guard 
could  have  used  to  compare  its  approach  before  it  decided  to  empower  the  contrac-
tors with so much authority? 

Answer. We have not done any analyses that would have identified a comparable 
military  contract  that  the  Coast  Guard  could  have  used  to  compare  its  approach. 
In  terms  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  decision  to  use  this  approach,  we  reported  in  2001 
that  documentation  detailing  the  basis  for  the  decision—the  depth  of  the  analysis 
performed,  the  factors  considered,  the  expertise  sought  (people  contacted),  and  the 
compelling reasons why the approach was chosen—was not recorded prior to its ap-
proval  by  Coast  Guard  acquisition  officials.  At  that  time,  we  noted  that  without 
thorough documentation, the rigor of the Coast Guard’s analysis was unknown.

Question  1.  As  part  of  the  GAO’s  2005  review  of  the  Deepwater  program,  GAO 
proposed  11  recommendations  for  the  Coast  Guard  to  implement  to  improve  con-
tractor  oversight  and  ensure  greater  accountability.  In  your  2006  report,  the  GAO 
states  that  the  Coast  Guard  has  implemented  or  partially  implemented  10  of  the 
11 recommendations. In light of what we now know regarding the National Security 
Cutter,  has  the  Coast  Guard  made  additional  progress  toward  fully  implementing 
your recommendations? 

Answer.  Since  our  2004  report,  the  Coast  Guard  has  taken  a  number  of  steps  to 
address  issues  contained  in  these  recommendations.  In  February  2007,  the  Coast 
Guard  reported  to  Congress  on  the  status  of  its  efforts  in  implementing  our  rec-
ommendations to improve program management, ensure greater accountability, and 
facilitate cost control through competition. We are in the process of assessing Coast

Guard  actions  in  response  to  our  recommendations  and  expect  to  report  on  the  re-
sults of our analysis later this year. 

Question 1a. Does the GAO believe the recommendations go far enough? 
Answer. We made these original recommendations 3 years ago. While we strongly 
believe they were comprehensive at the time and have led to some positive changes 
in  the  way  the  Coast  Guard  is  managing  and  overseeing  the  Deepwater  program, 
the  program  continues  to  evolve  over  time  and  our  ongoing  work  may  lead  to  addi-
tional recommendations. 

Question  1b.  In  the  research  GAO  conducted  on  Deepwater  over  the  last  several 
years,  was  there  any  indication—either  from  the  Coast  Guard  or  from  your  own 
auditors—of the problems that have come to light with respect to the National Secu-
rity Cutter? 

Answer.  While  we  have  been  reviewing  the  Deepwater  program  for  a  number  of 
years,  the  focus  of  our  reviews  has  been  on  issues  related  to  the  condition  of  the 
legacy  assets  that  are  being  replaced,  changes  to  the  Deepwater  implementation 
plans  to  incorporate  post-9/11  homeland  security  requirements,  and  management 
and oversight of the program. We have only recently shifted the focus of our reviews 
to the individual assets that are being designed and constructed as part of the Deep-
water  program.  In  planning  and  performing  our  Deepwater  reviews,  we  coordinate 
not  only  with  our  Congressional  clients,  but  also  with  others  in  the  Federal  audit 
community,  in  particular,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  Office  of  Inspec-
tor  General  (DHS–IG).  In  late  2005,  we  determined  that  DHS–IG  was  planning  to 
begin a review of the National Security Cutter and in an effort to not duplicate work 
they  were  doing,  have  delayed  any  work  we  planned  involving  the  NSC  until  they 
completed their review. Now that the DHS–IG report has been released, we are now 
in  the  process  of  determining  whether  there  are  remaining  issues  that  should  be 
pursued that were not addressed in the DHS–IG report. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

STEPHEN L. CALDWELL 

Question. Do you believe that the Deepwater program is still ‘‘risky,’’ as GAO stat-

ed in a 2004 report? 

Answer.  We  first  described  the  Deepwater  program  as  ‘‘risky’’  in  2001  due  to  the 
unique,  untried  acquisition  strategy  for  a  program  of  this  magnitude  within  the 
Coast Guard. Because it did not have the technical expertise or resources, the Coast 
Guard decided to use a system-of-systems approach in which it relied on a systems 
integrator (contractor) to replace the Coast Guard’s deteriorating assets with an in-
tegrated  package  of  aircraft,  vessels,  associated  communications  equipment,  and 
supporting logistics. In a system-of-systems arrangement, the delivery of Deepwater 
assets  is  interdependent  and  schedule  slippages  and  uncertainties  associated  with 
potential  changes  in  the  design  or  deployment  of  any  one  asset  can  increase  the 
overall risk that the Coast Guard might not be able to meet its expanded homeland 
security missions within given budget parameters and milestone dates. In addition, 
the Deepwater program is a performance-based acquisition, meaning that it is struc-
tured  around  the  results  to  be  achieved  rather  than  the  manner  in  which  work  is 
performed.  If  performance-based  acquisitions  are  not  appropriately  planned  and 
structured, there is an increased risk that the government may receive products and 
services that are over cost estimates, delivered late, and of unacceptable quality. In 
2004 and in subsequent assessments in 2005 and 2006, we reported concerns about 
the  Deepwater  program  in  three  main  areas—improving  program  management, 
strengthening contractor accountability, and promoting cost control through greater 
competition among potential subcontractors. While the Coast Guard has taken some 
actions  to  improve  program  outcomes,  the  program  still  contains  risks  and  we  will 
continue  to  assess  the  Coast  Guard’s  progress  at  addressing  the  outstanding  rec-
ommendations. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

CAPTAIN KEVIN P. JARVIS 

Question  1.  Were  there  specific  performance  requirements  for  each  major  asset 
that allowed the Coast Guard to hold ICGS accountable? If not, how could the assets 
that  ICGS  was  delivering  be  evaluated  in  terms  of  whether  they  met  Coast  Guard 
needs? 

Answer. As part of the performance-based contract strategy, the Coast Guard was 
providing  the  contractor  maximum  latitude  to  develop  the  particular  asset  charac-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00125 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

122 

teristics  that  would  deliver  the  needed  ‘‘integrated’’  system  performance  attributes. 
With  the  exception  of  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC)  which  had  specific  per-
formance  requirements  stipulated  as  part  of  the  contract,  each  proposed  asset  from 
the  contractor  would  have  an  accompanying,  ‘‘performance  specification’’  which 
would  be  delivered  as  a  contract  CDRL  for  Coast  Guard  review  and  approval.  The 
concept  was  that  this  ‘‘performance  spec’’  would  be  the  contract  document  which 
would  assure  the  Coast  Guard  the  needed  tool  for  holding  the  contractor  account-
able. Unfortunately, the original version of the ‘‘performance spec’’, provided as part 
of the contractor’s proposal, was revised with (G–D) IPT approval as the asset’s ca-
pabilities  matured  such  that  the  required  performance  spec  now  aligned  with  the 
delivered  asset  capabilities.  This  process  of  continual  specification  adjustments  to 
meet  asset  delivery  realities  was  contrary  to  the  contract’s  original  premise  of  hav-
ing  an  asset  built  to  an  established  performance  specification;  not  the  other  way 
around.  Examples  of  this  contorted  process  are  most  evident  with  123′  WPB  per-
formance specification revisions and their related time-lines. 

Question 2. Captain, I am concerned with the fact that the Coast Guard has rein-
terpreted  the  performance  requirements  for  the  NSC.  Did  this  also  occur  with  the 
123′ conversion or any other vessel assets? 

Answer.  Many  of  the  NSC  performance  requirement  modifications  can  correctly 
be  tied  back  to  9/11-induced  increases  in  needed  performance  and  capability.  The 
same can not be said for, or honestly justify the 123′ WPB performance specification 
modifications. In my opinion, the 123′ specification reinterpretation efforts were the 
results  of  realized  performance,  capability  and  anticipated  cost  induced  gaps  that 
could  be  conveniently  closed  by  adjusting  the  performance  specification.  This  meth-
od  of  adjusting  the  performance  specification  for  an  assortment  of  reasons  existed 
with other assets as well. 

Question  3.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  Inspector  General  is  today 
releasing  a  report  that  concludes  that  ICGS,  on  several  occasions,  willfully  and 
knowingly  deviated  from  contractual  obligations  in  modifying  the  110′  patrol  boats. 
Is this conclusion surprising to you? 
Answer. As of this date I have not read the DHS IG report on the 110′–123′ patrol 
boat  modification.  That  said,  I  would  not  be  surprised  with  their  conclusions  since 
I  was  continually  voicing  ‘‘contract  accountability’’  concerns  as  the  program  ‘‘ruth-
lessly executed’’ the contract. The 100′–123′ modification process is filled with many 
examples  of  convenient  contract  interpretation  and  decisions  that  continually  frus-
trated G–S and MLC naval engineers. 

Question 4. Why do you think it took so long for the concerns of the Coast Guard’s 

own engineering experts to be heard? 

Answer.  I  don’t  know  and  it  was  one  of  the  most  frustrating  circumstances  I’ve 
ever experienced in my Coast Guard career! That said, the G–D leadership was very 
comfortable  with  their  complete  reliance  on  their  ‘‘outsourced’’  and  ‘‘industry’’  pro-
vided  engineering  inputs.  The  continual  rhetoric  from  the  entire  G–D  staff  con-
cerning  this  position  stalled  any  opportunity  to  equally  and  fairly  assess  the  Coast 
Guard  engineer’s  technical  recommendations  and  warnings.  By  categorizing  G–S 
input  as  ‘‘too  cautionary’’  and  ‘‘obstructions’’  to  project  schedule  completion,  G–D 
was  able  to  discount  many  G–S  assessments.  Why  this  obvious  G–D  position  to 
‘‘outsource’’  and  trivialize  the  G–S  technical  efforts  was  so  successful  with  the  re-
mainder of the senior Coast Guard leadership is still a great mystery to me. 

Question  5.  I  understand  that  unlike  traditional  procurement,  under  the  Deep-
water  project,  ICGS  was  supposed  to  bear  greater  responsibility  for  sustainment  of 
the assets it was delivering. Was this your experience? 

Answer.  The  contractor’s  proposal  included  not  only  greater  responsibility  for 
maintenance and sustainment of their new assets, but also the expectation of need-
ed sustainment initiatives for the ‘‘to be replaced’’ Coast Guard legacy assets. ICGS 
first delivered surface asset, the 123′ WPB had a poorly integrated and almost non- 
existent maintenance and logistic sustainment plan. Although the G–S organization 
recognized  this  ICGS  sustainment  gap  and  offered  a  ‘‘logistic  bridging  strategy’’ 
until theirs matured, it was not accepted by IGCS and ultimately the G–D program. 
In  addition  to  the  123′  WPB  structural  failures,  the  ICGS  inability  to  logistically 
sustain  the  planned  123′  operational  profile  contributed  to  the  eventual  failure  of 
110′–123′ modification part of the ‘‘system-of-systems’’ concept. As for the ICGS ‘‘leg-
acy’’ sustainment commitment to the Coast Guard, it only materialized after signifi-
cant senior level pressure and high visibility material needs for both the surface and 
air  legacy  assets.  On  the  surface  side  of  the  ledger,  the  270/210  MEP  and  the  110 
MSA  projects  were  not  funding  sustainment  responsibilities  the  ICGS  elements  or 
G–D program elements willingly accepted or promoted. At the time of my departure 
from  the  Coast  Guard,  there  still  existed  significant  risk  with  the  ICGS  NSC

logistical  support  plan.  Many  requests  for  supply  chain  process  details  were  never 
answered by ICGS logistical elements. The absence of any established ‘‘sustainment 
process’’  for  the  NSC  is  currently  a  major  problem  that  has  only  recently  received 
appropriate attention. 

Question 6. Captain, does the Coast Guard have the ability to supply any capabili-

ties, such as logistics, themselves rather than relying on ICGS? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  has  a  very  flexible,  talented  and  proven  engineering, 
logistics  and  maintenance  sustainment  capability  for  its  surface,  air  and  C4ISR  as-
sets.  This  capability  and  expertise  exists  at  their  ELC,  AR&SC,  TISCOM  and 
C2CEN  Centers  of  Excellence  in  addition  to  their  MLC  organizational  infrastruc-
ture.  From  the  beginning  of  the  Deepwater  contract,  the  remainder  of  the  Coast 
Guard tried to leverage this proven technical expertise and capability as a value add 
to the program and ICGS to no avail. 

Question  7.  Do  you  think  that  the  Coast  Guard  could  obtain  the  assets  it  needs 
through  a  more  traditional  contract,  instead  of  the  current  ‘‘integrated’’  ICGS  ap-
proach? 

Answer.  Yes.  Although  the  Coast  Guard  has  never  been  faced  with  such  a  large 
asset replacement program in the past, I firmly believe Coast Guard directorate per-
sonal can be organizationally blended under the guidance of the SAM to achieve su-
perior asset procurement and integration results. 

Question  8.  What  was  ‘‘integration’’  supposed  to  mean,  and  in  your  opinion,  has 

Answer.  My  expectation  of  integration  was  a  carefully  constructed  strategic  and 
tactical execution process by which each delivered asset would to the greatest extent 
possible,  leverage  commonality  and  interoperability  of  their  technical  development 
processes,  material  supply  chain  elements,  operational  capabilities,  workforce  sup-
port  infrastructure  and  training  concepts.  Although  it  is  still  relatively  early  in  the 
overall ICGS Deepwater timeline and this may indeed become a reality, to date this 
level of integration is painfully absent. 

Question 9. The recent Defense Acquisition University report notes that the Coast 
Guard  is  taking  steps  to  address  internal  management  issues  and  structures.  Do 
you  believe  that  such  steps  alone  are  enough  to  address  the  problems  that  have 
arisen with the Deepwater program? 

Answer. As a ‘‘quick look’’ report, the DAU assessment is a great start. As of this 
writing,  I  am  unaware  of  the  referenced  Blueprint  for  Acquisition  Reform  details, 
and how they address the organizational realignments necessary to ensure a ‘‘prop-
er’’  balance  exists  between  the  Coast  Guard’s  operational,  technical,  resource  and 
acquisition  staffs  and  their  initiatives.  As  crippling  as  the  Deepwater  program’s 
strategic and tactical execution errors were, it was their overly friendly relationship 
with the contractor and their seemingly purposeful and planned corruption of prov-
en  organizational  roles,  responsibilities  and  relationships  that  doomed  any  possible 
positive  program  results.  It  is  here  where  the  DAU  report  only  scratches  the  sur-
face. 

Question  10.  Do  you  think  the  Lead  Systems  Integrator  approach  is  bringing  an 

it panned out? 

extra value or cost savings? 

Answer.  No.  I  firmly  believe  the  Coast  Guard  has  the  needed  ‘‘integration’’  capa-

bility with a much better ‘‘value add’’ metric. 

Question 11. The rationale that the Deepwater office gave for proceeding with the 
NSC  despite  Admiral  Brown’s  concerns  was  that  to  delay  would  result  in  costs  to 
the  project  due  to  the  fact  that  ‘‘long  lead-time  materials’’—including  some  pretty 
major items such as engines—had already been put into place. Does this mean that 
the  Coast  Guard  had  already  issued  an  order  for  Northrop  to  begin  work  on  this 
project before the Coast Guard even authorized the design? 

Answer.  On  March  19,  2003,  the  Coast  Guard  signed  the  delivery  task  orders 
(DTO)  which  authorized  the  ordering  of  NSC  long  lead-time  materials  (LLTM)  and 
commencement  of  contract  and  detailed  design.  The  alignment  of  these  two  DTO’s 
is  not  uncommon  since  many  critical  hull  characteristics  and  key  internal  compo-
nents,  some  of  which  are  long  lead  times  materials,  are  identified  and  typically  ac-
knowledged  as  building  sequence  steps  leading  up  to  the  ‘‘contract  and  detail  de-
sign’’  step.  The  significance  of  these  dates,  their  relationship  to  when  NSC  struc-
tural  designs  concerns  were  raised  by  G–S  Naval  Engineers  and  the  rational  of 
using  LLTM  delays  to  the  Admiral  Brown  memo  is  indeed  troubling.  Almost  from 
the  award  of  the  Deepwater  contract  in  June  2002,  G–S  engineers  utilized  the  IPT 
process  to  identify,  discuss  and  try  to  resolve  what  would  eventually  become  ‘‘inde-
pendently  verified’’  structural  design  concerns  with  the  NSC.  During  the  months 
June  through  October  2002,  the  G–S  elements  at  virtually  every  IPT  level  docu-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00127 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

124 

mented concerns with the ‘‘functional design’’ and recommended a series of ‘‘mitiga-
tion’’  steps  to  reduce  the  risk  while  the  NSC  was  still  in  the  ‘‘electronic  design’’ 
phase.  Our  collective  concern  was  to  address  and  mitigate  these  concerns  prior  to 
cutting any steel. In the Fall of 2002, a Flag level presentation with G–D (the Coast 
Guard  Deepwater  program  manager),  G–S,  G–O  and  elements  from  ICGS  and  the 
ELC  present,  officially  raised  the  engineering  concerns  to  the  Flag  Level.  Concur-
rently, these concerns were also documented at the 0–6 level indicating our opinion 
that the NSC design wasn’t ready to progress through subsequent contract approval 
steps. In spite of these concerns and continual risk discussions, no collaborative cor-
rective  steps  were  accomplished  within  IPT  structure.  The  design  moved  forward 
and  the  LLTM  and  contact/detail  design  were  awarded.  From  the  award  of  these 
DTOs  to  the  ‘‘production  readiness  review’’  (PRR)  and  the  ultimate  NSC  construc-
tion build authorization (awarded June 20, 2004), G–S engineers undertook a series 
of  independent  engineering  analysis  steps  to  add  yet  additional  credibility  to  our 
findings and recommendations. The contract completion of this independent analysis 
was  specifically  established  to  coincide  weeks  before  the  planned  PRR.  It  was  be-
cause  of  this  timing  and  the  formality  of  Admiral  Brown’s  approval  and  the  for-
warding  memo  on  March  29,  2004,  to  G–D,  we  hoped  to  have  one  last  chance  to 
make the necessary design changes before the DTO was signed by G–D to authorize 
ICGS  to  commence  building  the  NSC.  The  facts  indicate  that  even  this  additional 
verification  had  little  effect  on  the  NSC  advertised  delivery  schedule.  Because  of 
these  past  schedule-driven  practices,  for  the  program  to  now  use  LLTM  as  the  ra-
tional  for  project  delay  costs  associated  with  proceeding  with  NSC  construction 
seems  unjustified.  After  all,  the  official  authorization  to  actually  start  building  the 
NSC  didn’t  occur  until  almost  3  months  later.  I  concede  that  there  could  be  some 
increased  costs  and  delays  if  the  program  acted  now,  almost  18  months  after  G–S 
first identified their concerns, but at least it would still be before any authorization 
to  cut  steel  was  approved  by  the  Coast  Guard.  To  my  knowledge  G–S  was  never 
provided  or  shown  any  details  as  part  of  a  cost  analysis  comparing  possible  delay 
costs with possible engineering corrective costs after delivery of the NSC. 

Question  12.  A  traditional  procurement  allows  the  Coast  Guard  to  set  detailed 
specifications  and  requirements.  With  Deepwater,  the  Coast  Guard  set  its  perform-
ance  requirements  and  ICGS  has  the  freedom  to  suggest  what  products  it  should 
buy  or  design  to  meet  those  requirements.  Isn’t  that  approach  risky  and  open  to  a 
high degree of disagreement? 

Answer.  A  performance-based  contract  versus  the  traditional  approach  with  gov-
ernment  provided  details  and  requirements  could  be  deemed  more  risky.  But  by 
using  a  careful  balance  of  traditional  contract  and  performance  contract  elements, 
the  risk  could  be  mitigated  to  an  acceptable  level.  The  placement  of  this  balance 
point  was  a  continual  source  of  disagreements  with  this  contract.  Many  G–S  tech-
nical  details  and  requirements  originally  provided  were  deemed  too  prescriptive  by 
the  industry  teams  and  obviously  the  G–D  staff.  As  a  result,  they  were  eventually 
removed  and  the  contract  balance  point  shifted  to  a  decidedly  greater  performance- 
based contract. This in turn set-up future friction points where G–S engineers eval-
uated  the  technical  merit  of  ICGS  deliverables  and  determined  a  number  of  per-
formance  gaps  with  the  various  designs.  Because  of  the  nature  of  the  contract  and 
the unhealthy reliance on the contractors engineering input by the G–D staff, these 
early  G-S  performance  assessments  would  have  to  await  the  actual  delivery  of  the 
specific  asset  to  test  or  prove  its  performance  capability.  The  performance  results 
of  123′  WPB  speak  loudly  on  the  risks  of  performance  contracts  that  go  unchal-
lenged early in the design phase. 

Question 13. Isn’t that what’s happening now, with the National Security Cutter? 
Answer. Yes. G–S-projected NSC performance gaps will not be validated until de-
livery  and  acceptance  trials  are  completed.  Our  point  continues  to  be  that  once 
founded,  these  gaps  may  be  either  too  expensive  or  feasibly  impossible  to  correct. 
Do  we  then  accept  the  asset  with  these  flaws,  or  is  the  contract  mechanism  strong 
enough to establish damages against the contractor? The early unresolved disagree-
ments  associated  with  this  performance-based  contract  will  result  in  difficult  times 
answering the previous question. 

Question  14.  In  your  testimony,  you  state  that  ‘‘the  NSC  is  getting  closer  to  an 
operational  status  with  many  of  the  needed  logistical  support  details  and 
deliverables  still  ill-defined’’.  Is  there  a  problem  with  the  logistical  support  that 
ICGS is supposed to supply? 

Answer.  Yes!  After  5  years  of  contract  life,  millions  of  dollars  expended  on  the 
ICGS analysis of Coast Guard logistic and maintenance practices, promises of robust 
supply chain processes, performance-based contracts and responsive logistic delivery 
systems,  the  Coast  Guard  has  yet  to  see  any  real  details  which  support  the  ICGS

claims.  With  this  reality  and  the  dismal  logistic  support  capability  for  the  123′ 
WPB,  for  the  last  year  of  my  Coast  Guard  career,  we  were  developing  the  strategy 
and tactics needed to implement an executable Coast Guard logistic plan to support 
the  NSC  in  anticipation  of  an  ICGS  failure  to  support  NSC1.  Using  past  Coast 
Guard major acquisitions and a similar delivery reference point to that of the NSC, 
a bulk of the provisioning technical documentation, equipment spares, support plans 
and organizational policies and practices would have already been in place. This lo-
gistic performance gap is as severe, if not more so than the various ICGS-delivered 
design deficiencies. 
respect to the 123′ patrol boats? 

Question  15.  Can  you  tell  us  why  you  think  we  are  in  situation  we  are  in  with 
Answer.  In  my  opinion,  the  123′  situation  resulted  from  a  number  of  avoidable 
factors. Mostly significant of these was the poorly crafted organizational relationship 
whereby the Deepwater program placed a greater trust and confidence in their own 
contractors and the ICGS engineers rather then the Coast Guard‘s own proven, un-
biased technical and logistic experts. Add to this, a performance-based contract with 
relatively  few  established  technical  requirements,  even  fewer  efforts  to  mandate 
thorough  reviews  of  established  contract  deliverables,  and  finally  a  schedule  that 
was ‘‘ruthlessly executed’’ by all G–D elements. Collectively, these integrated factors 
turned  old,  but  economically  repairable  110′  WPBs,  into  new  structurally  com-

CAPTAIN KEVIN P. JARVIS 

Question.  Captain  Jarvis,  your  background  as  the  former  Chief  System’s  Deep-
water  Integration  Officer  and  Engineering  and  Logistics  Center  Director  puts  you 
in a unique position to have very informed views on the best way to fix the current 
problems with the Deepwater program. What are the most significant changes that 
you think the Coast Guard should make to get the program back on track? 

Senator  Inouye,  I  offered  a  number  of  un-prioritized  corrective  recommendations 
as part of both my written and oral testimony. I also indicated that many of Admi-
ral Allen’s current Deepwater-related actions and initiatives will do wonders in get-
ting the Deepwater program back on an even keel. Along with his establishment of 
the  G-S  directorate  as  the  Coast  Guard’s  ‘‘technical  authority’’  for  all  engineering- 
related issues, the following are the most significant changes that I believe need to 
take  place.  First,  greater  contract  accountability,  visibility  and  contractor  oversight 
is  an  absolute  must.  I  suspect  this  will  require  a  certain  amount  of  restructuring 
with  the  existing  contract,  but  in  the  long  run,  it  should  help  avoid  a  duplication 
of these first disastrous 5 years. Second, the Coast Guard should be enabled to con-
tract directly with asset builders, and the G–S cutter certification matrix should be 
incorporated as the basis for needed technical building requirements and standards. 
The  System  Integrator,  in  my  opinion  has  not  proven  his  worth.  Third,  the  current 
Coast Guard engineering and logistic infrastructure should be given first priority to 
logistically  sustain  and  maintain  its  fleet;  it  has  the  capability  and  expertise.  Only 
if  a  ‘‘real’’  cost  benefit  analysis  proves  that  an  outsourcing  option  provides  a  better 
result  should  the  Coast  Guard  capability  be  assessed  for  replacement.  Concurrent 
with  any  outsourcing  decision,  extreme  care  needs  to  be  taken  to  ensure  that  only 
distinct ‘‘outsourceable’’ elements are identified and that the entire Coast Guard ca-
pability isn’t compromised by piecemeal outsourced operations. The remainder of my 
written recommendations can be implemented in any order. 

RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

MR. PHILIP A. TEEL 

Question  1.  Mr.  Teel,  the  list  of  problems  with  surface  assets  is  long.  The  123- 
foot  patrol  boat  conversion  failed  and  8  Coast  Guard  patrol  boats  are  now  out  of 
service;  the  design  of  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  has  been  found  to  be  unsuited  for 
Coast Guard’s needs, and the National Security Cutter as designed will not achieve 
the  Coast  Guard’s  performance  goals.  Does  Northrop  Grumman  bear  any  responsi-
bility for these problems? 

Answer.  Northrop  Grumman  is  wholly  dedicated  to  the  Deepwater  Program  and 
takes very seriously its contractual obligations to the Coast Guard. There is no sin-
gle  common  factor  associated  with  the  aforementioned  Deepwater  issues.  As  such, 
the  issues  associated  with  the  123s,  Fast  Response  Cutter  and  National  Security 
Cutter are separately addressed below in more detail.

123′ Conversion 

ICGS proposed the 123′ conversion as an appropriate means to provide the Coast 
Guard  with  the  necessary  capability  to  meet  its  mission  objectives  while  remaining 
within  the  confines  of  the  program  funding  requirements.  During  the  initial  Deep-
water  competition,  offerors  were  required  to  propose  a  ‘‘system  of  systems’’  solution 
that did not exceed the funding limitation of $500 million per year. With new assets 
such  as  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC),  Maritime  Patrol  Aircraft  (MPA)  and 
the  Vertical  Unmanned  Air  Vehicle  (VUAV)  being  developed  early  in  the  program, 
it  was  not  possible  to  design,  develop  and  construct  new  patrol  boats  at  program 
inception  while  keeping  within  those  annual  funding  limitations.  An  interim  solu-
tion was therefore proposed to modify the legacy 110-foot patrol boats to allow these 
modified vessels (converted to 123 feet) to satisfy many of the Coast Guard’s patrol 
boat requirements until a new design could be fielded. 
Our proposal to convert the 110′ vessels was based on information then available 
and  known  to  us.  Prior  to  proposal  submission,  Bollinger,  our  subcontractor  and 
original  builder  of  the  110s,  reviewed  Coast  Guard  surveys  of  major  structural  re-
pairs  performed  on  the  110  fleet.  These  surveys  indicated  that  110′  structural  defi-
ciencies, when present, were the result of corrosion and could be addressed by iden-
tifying  and  renewing  corroded  plating  and  structure.  This  information  was  con-
sistent with a Coast Guard report, dated March 8, 2002, prepared by the 110′ WPB 
Emergency  Service  Life  Evaluation  Board  (SLEB  Report).  The  SLEB  Report  stated 
that the 110′ hulls were in deteriorated condition but that the periodic repair of hull 
plating  would  improve  the  readiness  of  the  fleet.  Consistent  with  the  SLEB  Report 
and  the  Coast  Guard  surveys,  ICGS  determined  that  replacement  of  thin  hull  plat-
ing would be sufficient to overcome the deteriorated condition of the 110s. 

Following  contract  award,  but  before  any  conversion  work  began,  the  Coast 
Guard,  ICGS,  Northrop  Grumman,  and  Bollinger  conducted  a  Preliminary  Design 
Review, Critical Design Review, and Production Readiness Review of the 123′ design 
and  proposed  conversion  scope  of  work.  During  these  reviews,  ICGS  and  Northrop 
Grumman  presented  to  the  Coast  Guard  the  engineering  analyses  and  design  ap-
proach for the 123′ conversion effort. 
The  110′  vessels  delivered  for  conversion  were  in  worse  condition  than  antici-
pated. While the worse than expected condition of the ships would require more re-
placement  of  hull  plating,  the  Coast  Guard,  Northrop  Grumman,  and  Bollinger  did 
not believe that the viability of the conversion approach was in question. 
Following  the  buckling  on  the  MATAGORDA,  a  joint  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop 
Grumman  tiger  team  discovered  that  the  vessel  had  a  pre-existing  110′  workman-
ship issue at the location of the hull buckling. Specifically, a hidden, unwelded alu-
minum  deck  stringer  was  discovered  immediately  beneath  the  area  where  the  fail-
ure  occurred.  All  eight  123s  were  examined,  and  an  unwelded  stringer  was  found 
on  one  additional  hull  undergoing  conversion.  When  modeled  using  finite  element 
analysis, the stresses in the panels which failed on the MATAGORDA were signifi-
cantly  higher  than  the  stresses  shown  when  the  model  was  run  with  this  stringer 
intact. Based on this finding, ICGS and the Coast Guard believed this to be the pri-
mary  cause  of  the  buckling  on  MATAGORDA,  and  repairs  were  made  accordingly. 
In an effort to further improve the structural integrity of the 123s, three stiffener 
bands  were  installed;  one  at  the  upper  edge  of  the  side  shell,  one  below  this  one 
and  another  on  the  edge  of  the  main  deck  to  increase  the  overall  structural 
strength.  While  the  finite  element  analysis  and  conventional  calculations  both 
agreed that the original hull, with the stringer under the deck intact, should be suf-
ficient  throughout  the  expected  operating  range  of  the  123s,  these  additional  stiff-
eners  were  considered  to  provide  an  added  margin  of  strength.  The  three  stiffener 
bands were added to all the 123s. 
Northrop Grumman has been committed to and remains committed to identifying 
the  root  causes  of  the  123′  structural  issues.  After  learning  of  the  MATAGORDA 
buckling  in  mid-September  2004,  Northrop  Grumman  immediately  began  a  review 
of all available information and reports on the incident. Northrop Grumman formed 
a  Tiger  Team  with  the  Coast  Guard  Engineering  Logistics  Center  (ELC),  Bollinger 
Shipyards,  and  ICGS  to  investigate  the  cracking  and  buckling  problems  that  had 
occurred on this vessel during its transit run away from Hurricane Ivan. The Tiger 
Team investigation occurred between September 2004 and January 2005. 
As  part  of  the  Tiger  Team  effort,  Downey  Engineering  performed  finite  element 
analyses  of  the  123′,  which  modeled  the  converted  hull.  In  addition  to  these  anal-
yses,  Northrop  Grumman  performed  hull  girder  section  modulus  calculations  and 
longitudinal  strength  calculations.  Despite  these  extensive  analyses  and  calcula-
tions,  the  Tiger  Team  was  not  able  to  correlate  the  problems  actually  experienced 
on  the  vessel  based  on  the  reported  sea  states.  Northrop  Grumman  also  retained

Stress  Engineering  Services,  Inc.  to  conduct  metallurgical  testing  between  August 
2006  and  February  2007.  This  testing  revealed  an  issue  on  the  main  deck  that  ex-
ists on the 123s and across the entire legacy 110′ fleet. Northrop Grumman also col-
lected data on shaft alignment and maintenance procedures both during the conver-
sion and since, so that the procedures for checking and correcting alignment can be 
validated for both the 110′ and the 123′. Elements of the 123′ design, including the 
propellers and the stern-launch system, are being reexamined and validated. 

The Coast Guard ELC commissioned its own finite element analysis, which at the 
time  was  not  shared  with  Northrop  Grumman.  In  February  2006  NGSS  offered  to 
perform a comprehensive engineering assessment at no cost to the Coast Guard. The 
Coast  Guard  declined  the  offer  with  the  exception  of  some  metallurgical  testing.  In 
early  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  ELC  conducted  additional  testing  and  analysis  on  the 
123s.  Northrop  Grumman  was  not  provided  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  this 
testing. In fact, it was not until January 2007 that the Coast Guard began to share 
the  test  results  with  Northrop  Grumman.  Since  that  time,  however,  the  Coast 
Guard is now sharing their test data with Northrop Grumman so it can be analyzed 
in conjunction with all of the other test data. 

In summary, Northrop Grumman has assumed responsibility for working with the 
Coast  Guard  to  understand  the  structural  issues  experienced  on  the  123s,  and  has 
devoted, and will continue to devote, significant resources to this effort well beyond 
our contractual obligations. 
National Security Cutter 

The Contract contains a 30-year service life requirement for the NSC and the ves-
sel  as  designed  will  meet  this  requirement.  As  required  by  the  contract,  Northrop 
Grumman  designed  the  NSC  in  accordance  with  proven  U.S.  Navy  Design  Data 
Sheets.  In  fact,  the  NSC  design  is  structurally  more  sound  than  required  under 
these Navy standards 

The  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  agree  that  there  is  no  safety  issue  or 
operational restrictions associated with the current NSC design. In his January 30, 
2007  testimony  before  the  House  Subcommittee  on  Coast  Guard  and  Maritime 
Transportation,  Commandant  Allen  stated,  ‘‘There  has  never  been  a  question  of 
safety  related  to  the  ship’s  structure,  nor  have  we  ever  anticipated  any  operational 
restrictions related to its design.’’ In addition, the American Bureau of Shipbuilding 
(ABS) has certified the structural design drawings of the NSC. 

The  discussions  between  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  engineers  on  the 
NSC  relate  to  fatigue-life.  Unlike  service  life,  fatigue-life  is  not  a  contract  require-
ment. As discussed more fully in the response to National Security Cutter Question 
5  below,  the  Naval  Surface  Warfare  Center—Carderock  Division  (Navy  Carderock) 
performed  an  analysis  of  the  predicted  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC  using  a  model  not 
benchmarked or based upon valid historical data and realistic operating conditions. 
When  properly  benchmarked,  a  53.8  year  fatigue-life  is  predicted  for  the  NSC  de-
sign.  The  differing  fatigue-life  analyses  have  resulted  in  a  dialogue  between  engi-
neers  which  will  lead  to  a  final  determination  on  the  need  for  any  enhancements 
to further extend fatigue-life. 

Although  not  required  by  contract,  Northrop  Grumman  has  undertaken  the  re-
sponsibility  for  working  with  the  Coast  Guard  and  Navy  Carderock  to  achieve  con-
sensus on the predicted and desired fatigue-life of the NSC. Northrop Grumman has 
been  involved  in  extensive  analyses  and  dialogue  with  government  engineers  to  re-
solve these issues to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard. 
Fast Response Cutter 

ICGS  and  Northrop  Grumman  originally  proposed  a  Fast  Response  Cutter  (FRC) 
with a steel hull design. Following contract award, substantial post-9/11 changes in 
the  Coast  Guard’s  mission  and  requirements  resulted  in  a  set  of  required  capabili-
ties  that  exceeded  traditional  patrol  boat  functions.  As  a  consequence,  the  steel  de-
sign  originally  proposed  by  ICGS  and  Northrop  Grumman  did  not  satisfy  the  new 
and expanded requirements of the Coast Guard. In addition, the Coast Guard accel-
erated the delivery requirement for the FRC by 10 years. 

To meet the expanded post-9/11 requirements and accelerated schedule, Northrop 
Grumman  conducted  trade  studies,  the  results  of  which  indicated  that  a  composite 
hull would significantly reduce the life cycle cost of maintenance and best serve the 
Coast  Guard’s  new  post-9/11  mission  requirements.  The  Coast  Guard  then  elected 
to pursue the composite approach with a design-to-cost limit. This design-to-cost ap-
proach  became  a  ‘‘production  cost  cap’’  but  without  any  requirements  trade-offs 
being accepted by the Coast Guard. These design constraints resulted in a shortened 
vessel length and wider beam than traditional patrol boat hull dimensions. No exist-

128 

ing  patrol  boat  in  the  worldwide  inventory  could  satisfy  the  Coast  Guard’s  require-
ments set. 

The  Coast  Guard  and  industry  each  conducted  analyses  of  the  FRC  design  and 
the  best  value  approach  for  meeting  Coast  Guard  operational  requirements.  Nor-
throp  Grumman  is  not  aware  of  any  Coast  Guard  determination  that  the  FRC  de-
sign is ‘‘unsuited’’ for the post-9/11 mission requirements. To the contrary, an inde-
pendent  study  has  confirmed  the  ability  of  the  proposed  FRC  design  to  meet  the 
challenging Coast Guard operational requirements. 

Currently,  the  Coast  Guard  is  sponsoring  an  independent  business  case  analysis 
to  determine  if  a  steel  or  composite  hull  design  is  most  cost  effective.  Northrop 
Grumman analysis has shown that the service life of a composite hull will be consid-
erably longer than a traditional steel hull. While Northrop Grumman stands behind 
its  FRC  design,  it  will  support  the  Coast  Guard’s  ultimate  decision  in  this  matter. 
Question 2. How is it that under this performance-based contract, Northrop Grum-
man has tremendous discretion in choosing and designing the assets needed to meet 
Coast  Guard  needs,  and  yet  Northrop  is  not  responsible  for  assuring  that  these  as-
sets actually work and perform to those needs? 

Answer. ICGS does not ‘‘choose’’ the assets to be developed for the Deepwater Pro-
gram. Instead, the Coast Guard makes the choices after considering ICGS proposed 
asset  designs  which,  before  they  are  chosen,  are  reviewed  and  approved  by  Coast 
Guard senior leadership through a series of cross-functional government teams. The 
Coast  Guard  is  and  always  has  been  the  decisionmaking  and  contracting  authority 
for  the  Deepwater  Program,  and  has  retained  traditional  contract  management 
functions, including the right to issue unilateral change orders, to stop or terminate 
work,  to  order  or  not  order  assets  and  supplies,  and  to  accept  or  reject  the  work. 
ICGS  and  Northrop  Grumman  are  responsible  for  developing  surface  assets  that 
comply  with  the  performance  requirements.  Throughout  the  development  phase, 
ICGS  and  the  Coast  Guard  conduct  reviews  for  each  Deepwater  asset.  These  pro-
grammatic  reviews  include  a  System  Requirements  Review,  a  Preliminary  Design 
Review,  a  Critical  Design  Review  and  a  Production  Readiness  Review,  all  of  which 
are  conducted  with  the  Coast  Guard  before  the  actual  conversion  or  construction 
work begins. Leading up to each of these reviews, the evolving design, design draw-
ings  and  calculations  are  formally  presented  to  the  Coast  Guard  subject  matter  ex-
perts  in  increasing  detail  for  their  comment  and  approval.  Assets  are  not  con-
structed until the Coast Guard reviews and approves the design. 

The  Coast  Guard  is  responsible  for  determining  whether  the  surface  assets  meet 
applicable  performance  requirements.  Before  accepting  delivery  of  each  Deepwater 
surface  asset,  the  Coast  Guard  conducts  acceptance  testing  and  sea  trials  with  the 
assistance  of  third-party  experts.  For  example,  during  the  NSC  inspection  and  ac-
ceptance process, ABS will certify 35 ship systems, including Command and Control 
Systems,  Propulsion  Plant,  Machinery  Monitoring  and  Control,  Fuel  Systems,  An-
choring  Systems,  and  Steering  Systems.  Indeed,  prior  to  or  in  conjunction  with  the 
delivery of the NSC BERTHOLF, there will be a total of 46 independent third-party 
certifications.  These  independent  certifications  include  Final  Aircraft  Facilities, 
Flight  Deck  Status  and  Signaling,  Navigation  Systems,  Interior  Communications 
Systems, Guns and Ammunition Weapons System Safety, DOD Information Security 
and  Accreditation,  and  TEMPEST.  The  Navy’s  Board  of  Inspection  and  Survey  will 
conduct the Ship Acceptance Trials for the NSC. 

The contractual obligations of ICGS and Northrop Grumman do not end upon de-
livery  of  the  surface  assets.  Rather,  Northrop  Grumman  remains  responsible  after 
delivery for assuring that the Surface assets meet the contract requirements pursu-
ant  to  its  warranty  obligations.  For  example,  following  the  transfer  to  the  Coast 
Guard,  NSC  1  will  enter  a  twelve  month  warranty  period,  during  which  ICGS  will 
correct  any  deficient  items  or  complete  any  contractor-responsible  work.  This  one- 
year  warranty  period  was  specifically  requested  by  the  Coast  Guard  in  the  Deep-
water Request for Proposals (RFP), and is common to the shipbuilding industry. Any 
defects  in  workmanship  or  materials  provided  by  ICGS  that  occur  within  the  war-
ranty  period  are  corrected  by  ICGS  at  its  expense.  The  warranty  extends  to  the 
proper installation of Government-furnished property and, in the event modification 
is  performed  on  the  Government-furnished  property,  also  extends  to  such  modifica-
tion work. 

Any  failures  attributable  to  legacy  asset  equipment  in  a  conversion  or  upgrade 
program are corrected by the Coast Guard within their existing infrastructure. Fail-
ures  to  Deepwater  equipment  outside  the  terms  of  the  warranty  are  addressed  by 
the  ICGS  Lifetime  Operations  and  Support  organization  as  prioritized  and  funded 
by the Coast Guard. As in the case of the 123s, ICGS works cooperatively with the 
Coast  Guard  to  address  any  problems  with  the  ships  regardless  of  whether  these 
problems are within the scope of the warranty.

Question  3.  Do  you  know  of  any  examples  in  which  ICGS,  Lockheed  Martin,  or 
Northrop Grumman used the awarding of Deepwater subcontracts to industry part-
ners  as  a  means  to  leverage  other  potential  deals  or  contracts  for  Lockheed  Martin 
or Northrop Grumman? 

Answer.  No.  Competition  in  the  Deepwater  Program  is  governed  by  a  number  of 
procurement  rules  patterned  after  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR),  and 
are  designed  to  promote  full  and  fair  competition.  ICGS,  Northrop  Grumman,  and 
Lockheed  Martin  conduct  competitions  under  the  Deepwater  Program  pursuant  to 
these  FAR-based  provisions.  Northrop  Grumman  utilizes  these  competitive  proce-
dures to the maximum extent practicable. Awards are made on the basis of the best 
value for the Coast Guard and not on what is best for the contractors. 

Subcontract  procurement  under  the  Deepwater  Program  is  an  open  and  highly 
transparent  process.  All  Northrop  Grumman  purchases  over  $25K  are  individually 
reviewed  for  compliance  with  purchasing  guidelines,  and  the  purchasing  system  is 
audited  (usually  every  3  years)  by  the  Defense  Contract  Audit  Agency  (DCAA).  A 
government-sponsored  third-party  review  of  Deepwater  acquisition  practices  found 
Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman  subcontracting  statistics  to  be  favorable 
when compared to the statistics of Naval Air Systems Command and Naval Sea Sys-
tems  Command.  In  addition,  competition  for  subcontract  awards  is  encouraged  via 
the annual Industry and Innovation Days where suppliers and vendors have an op-
portunity  to  provide  input  on  new  or  improved  products.  ICGS  to  date  has  placed 
orders  with  more  than  600  suppliers  representing  more  than  41  states  and  main-
tains  an  active  database  of  over  3,000  potential  suppliers  from  which  it  draws  to 
host annual supplier Industry and Innovation Days. 

Proposals  from  affiliated  companies  are  judged  no  differently  than  other  pro-
posals.  For  example,  the  Unmanned  Air  Vehicle  subcontract  was  awarded  to  Bell 
Textron,  not  Northrop  Grumman,  and  the  Maritime  Patrol  Aircraft  went  to  CASA, 
not  Lockheed  Martin.  Recently,  the  Coast  Guard  has  changed  the  FRC  acquisition 
strategy to include two paths: FRC–A and FRC–B. The ICGS FRC–B team will rec-
ommend  to  the  Coast  Guard  a  candidate  design  from  a  competitive  field  of  world-
wide  patrol  boat  providers  and  is  expected  to  enter  concept  design  later  this  year. 
Northrop Grumman will not submit its own FRC–B design proposal. 

Through  December  31,  2006,  Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman  awarded 
73 subcontracts with values above the FAR threshold (which recently changed from 
$550k  to  $650k).  The  cumulative  value  of  the  73  awards  is  $788M.  Of  the  73 
awards, 81 percent were awarded either competitively or in accordance with a FAR 
exception to competition. In terms of dollars, of the $788M, 85 percent was awarded 
either competitively or in accordance with the FAR exceptions to competition. Of the 
1,335  purchase  orders  issued  since  program  inception,  32  were  made  to  Northrop 
Grumman affiliates comprising 11.5 percent of the total subcontracted dollars. 

Question  4.  I  understand  that  engineers  often  disagree  about  specifics  of  a  given 
design,  but  can  you  please  explain  why  Northrop  Grumman  continues  to  believe 
that  the  NSC  meets  the  requirements  of  the  contract—despite  the  findings  to  the 
contrary of the Coast Guard’s own experts and three independent studies conducted 
by well respected naval engineers? 

Answer. Northrop Grumman continues to believe that the NSC meets the contract 
requirements.  The  issues  that  have  been  raised  between  the  engineers  relate  pri-
marily  to  an  extra-contractual  matter:  fatigue-life.  Both  the  Coast  Guard  and  Nor-
throp  Grumman  agree  that  there  is  no  safety  issue  related  to  ship  structure  (also 
see  the  related  testimony  on  Page  78).  Nor  are  there  any  operational  restrictions 
associated  with  the  current  NSC  design.  The  NSC  structural  design  meets  the  30- 
year  service  life  requirements  of  the  contract  and  has  been  independently  certified 
by ABS. 

The  question  currently  being  addressed  by  Northrop  Grumman  and  the  Coast 
Guard  involves  the  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC  over  its  30-year  service  life.  Fatigue-life 
and service-life are two different concepts. Fatigue-life refers to the amount of time 
prior to the onset of cracks in structurally significant elements in the vessel. When 
cracking  occurs,  appropriate  repairs  are  performed.  While  some  degree  of  cracking 
is expected during the life of a vessel, determining the length of time between ship 
delivery  and  the  onset  of  cracking  is  not  an  exact  science.  Service  life,  in  contrast, 
is  the  amount  of  time  in  which  repairs  of  cracks  and  other  conditions  in  the  vessel 
remain economically viable to perform in order to keep the ship in service. 

Northrop  Grumman  and  Navy  Carderock  have  used  a  relatively  new  method  to 
model  the  predicted  NSC  fatigue-life  by  applying  different  approaches  to  existing 
ship designs, operational characteristics and hull form. The difference in the two ap-
proaches  relates  to  whether  the  model  is  benchmarked  using  historical  data  from 
ships that have operated in a known or defined sea state. The Navy Carderock per-
formed  their  fatigue  analysis  by  assuming  that  the  NSC  would  spend  100  percent

of the time in specific locations known for very bad weather conditions. Based upon 
‘‘real-world’’  operational  experiences  with  naval  vessels,  the  NSC  will  encounter  a 
variety of sea states, as defined in the Contract. 

Many of the structural issues raised by the Coast Guard during the design phase 
have been resolved as part of the design process. For example, Northrop Grumman 
has  made  enhancements  to  address  Coast  Guard  structural  concerns  with  the  de-
sign of the ship bottom. Northrop Grumman has added structural enhancements to 
the  ship  superstructure  and  superstructure  re-entrant  design  in  response  to  Coast 
Guard  concerns,  and  has  further  addressed  structural  issues  raised  by  the  Coast 
Guard  by  using  reduced  penetrations  in  the  deck  stringer  plates  and  reinforced 
those  that  were  still  required  using  Navy  fatigue  guidance  criteria.  The  structural 
changes  have  been  incorporated  into  the  NSC  1,  the  BERTHOLF,  and  are  part  of 
the baseline design. 

To  the  extent  the  ongoing  discussions  with  the  Coast  Guard  result  in  the  Coast 
Guard  requiring  fatigue-related  structural  enhancements,  those  enhancements  will 
be provided consistent with Coast Guard requirements. 

Question  5.  Isn’t  it  the  case  that  ICGS  proposed  the  ‘‘230  underway  days’’  stand-
ard  as  part  of  its  winning  Deepwater  solution  that  was  accepted  by  the  Coast 
Guard? Why is there any confusion about this standard now? 

Answer. There should be no confusion about the ‘‘days underway’’ requirement for 
the  NSC.  ICGS  did  not  propose  a  standard  that  the  NSC  be  ‘‘underway’’  for  230 
days a year. The performance specification and concept of operations documents pro-
posed  by  ICGS  stated  that  the  ship  must  be  capable  of  ‘‘230  Days  Away  From 
Homeport.’’  This  translates  to  185  days  at  sea  (165  mission  days  and  20  average 
transit days) and 45 in port logistics days away from homeport. 

In  particular,  the  NSC  operational  profile  is  contained  in  the  NSC  performance 
specification and includes approximately four, 60 day patrols per year. These encom-
pass  230  days  away  from  homeport  each  year.  After  every  9–12  patrolling  days,  a 
mid-patrol  break  of  three  to  4  days  is  scheduled  for  crew  rest.  Brief  stops  for  fuel 
of  a  single  day  or  less  may  be  taken  according  to  operational  needs  and  proximity 
to  a  fueling  location.  These  rest  and  reprovisioning  standards  are  scheduled  to  bal-
ance  out  the  breaks  during  the  patrol,  optimizing  stores  levels  with  operational 
needs.  The  60  day  patrols  contemplate  eight  transit  days,  12  in-port  logistics  days 
and 40 operational mission days, for a total of 185 underway days per year. 

The  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  are  in  agreement  on  this  issue.  Com-
mandant  Allen  stated  in  his  testimony  before  this  Subcommittee:  ‘‘But,  by  the  con-
tract, it is 230 days away from home port, 185 days on station, conducting mission, 
and  that  is  the  parameters  by  which  the  models  are  applied  for  how  long  the  sea 
stay  [sic,  state]  would  act  on  the  hull  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  fatigue- 
life.’’ 

Question  6.  Didn’t  the  contract  state  that  the  30-year  life  of  the  ship  was  based 

on an assumption of 230 days underway? 

Answer.  As  discussed  above,  the  30-year  service  life  of  the  ship  was  based  on  an 
assumption of 230 days away from homeport, not days underway. The ‘‘30-year life’’ 
requirement  does  not  pertain  to  fatigue-life.  As  discussed  above,  fatigue-life  refers 
to  the  amount  of  time  prior  to  the  onset  of  cracks  in  structurally  significant  ele-
ments  in  the  vessel,  while  service  life  is  the  amount  of  time  in  which  repairs  of 
cracks  and  other  conditions  in  the  vessel  remain  economically  viable  to  perform  in 
order to keep the ship in service. 

In  determining  fatigue-life,  the  controlling  assumption  is  the  amount  of  time  the 
vessel  spends  in  extreme  sea  states,  not  total  days  underway.  This  assumption 
forms the basis for the differing engineering predictions of fatigue-life. 

Question  7.  Do  you  believe  that  the  National  Security  Cutter  meets  the  require-

ments of the contract? 

Answer. Yes. As stated previously, the NSC was designed in accordance with con-
tract  specifications.  We  have  worked  and  will  continue  to  work  with  the  Coast 
Guard  to  resolve  the  open  issues,  and  we  continue  to  stand  behind  the  design  and 
construction of the NSC and its ability to meet service life and operational perform-
ance requirements of the contract. 

Question 8. Why do Northrop Grumman and the Coast Guard disagree on wheth-
er  the  design  meets  even  the  lower  performance  requirement  of  170–180  days  un-
derway? 

Answer. As stated previously, the requirement for 185 days at sea is not a ‘‘lower’’ 
or  ‘‘relaxed’’  performance  requirement.  The  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman 
have no difference of opinion on the service life of the NSC. Indeed, in his January 
30,  2007  testimony  before  the  House  Subcommittee  on  Coast  Guard  and  Maritime 
Transportation,  Commandant  Allen  explained,  ‘‘the  issue  here  . . .  is  a  question  of 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00134 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

131 

fatigue-life over the course of the cutter’s 30-year service life.’’ The disagreement re-
garding fatigue-life revolves around assumption of sea state conditions, not days un-
derway. 

When  the  model  is  calibrated  in  accordance  with  Navy  fatigue-life  guidance  in-
structions,  and  realistic  real-world  sea  state  conditions,  the  NSC  fatigue-life  is  pre-
dicted  to  be  nearly  54  years.  We  will  continue  to  work  and  resolve  this  issue  with 
the Coast Guard. 

Question  9.  Although  your  testimony  indicates  that  the  NSC  was  built  to  Navy 
specifications,  the  Coast  Guard  is  not  the  Navy,  and  has  different  operating  needs. 
Did you take that into consideration when designing the NSC? 

Answer.  Yes.  The  NSC  was  designed  and  built  to  meet  Coast  Guard,  not  Navy, 
mission  needs.  In  the  RFP,  the  Coast  Guard  included  performance  specification  re-
quirements for the NSC that reflected existing operational needs. The Coast Guard 
performance specifications required Northrop Grumman to design and construct the 
NSC  in  accordance  with  the  Cutter  Specific  Certification  Matrix  (CSCM).  The  NSC 
CSCM did not impose any new or additional operational requirements, but provided 
the standards for verification that the performance requirements are met. 

The  CSCM  contained  Design  Data  Sheets,  which  are  widely  accepted  within  the 
shipbuilding  industry  as  the  ‘‘traditional  approach’’  to  design  and  build  ships.  For 
decades,  the  Design  Data  Sheet  approach  has  produced  successful  designs  over  a 
wide  range  of  vessels.  This  approach  implies  an  acceptable  fatigue-life  and  long- 
term ship performance based on a reasonable level of maintenance. Northrop Grum-
man has used the Data Design Sheet approach in the design of numerous Navy ves-
sels.  Although  the  Data  Design  Sheets  are  commonly  used  for  Navy  vessels,  they 
are not ‘‘Navy-only specifications.’’ Nor do they substitute Navy operational require-
ments for Coast Guard operational requirements. 

Question 10. In your opinion, is the disagreement simply a communications failure 

between Northrop and the Coast Guard? 

Answer. Certainly some of the issues associated with the Deepwater program are 
a result of communications issues. For instance many of the issues identified in the 
DHS IG report relate to poor communications between Coast Guard functional orga-
nizations  such  as  the  Engineering  Logistics  Center  and  Requirements  organization 
and  the  Deepwater  program  team.  Management  of  the  ICGS  contract  is  handled 
through  the  Deepwater  program  office  and  the  functional  organizations  do  not  feel 
that  their  issues  are  adequately  represented  through  the  Deepwater  program. 
Issues  remain  unresolved  for  long  periods  and,  in  some  cases,  even  when  resolved 
contractually (between ICGS and Coast Guard Deepwater program), are not accept-
ed as resolved by the functional organizations. 

The  recent  steps  announced  by  Admiral  Allen  to  re-align  functions  within  the 
Coast  Guard  to  provide  greater  oversight  and  responsiveness  to  address  procure-
ment  management  and  technical  issues  will  certainly  address  many  of  the  Deep-
water acquisition issues. This approach will yield benefits and significantly enhance 
the ability of the Deepwater Program to deliver the assets and support our Nation’s 
needs to address post-9/11 mission requirements. 

Several weeks ago, Commandant Allen met with Northrop Grumman CEO Ronald 
Sugar  and  Lockheed  Martin  CEO  Robert  Stevens  in  the  first  of  a  planned  series  of 
meetings to discuss near and long-term objectives and goals for the Deepwater Pro-
gram.  As  an  outcome,  ICGS  and  the  Coast  Guard  recently  developed  a  Statement 
of Strategic Intent to provide a management framework for developing the way for-
ward  on  the  Deepwater  Program.  In  addition,  the  Statement  of  Strategic  Intent  is 
intended to clarify the roles the Coast Guard and ICGS in performance of the Deep-
water  mission.  ICGS  will  be  responsive  to  the  changes  requested  by  the  Coast 
Guard. 

Question 11. Mr. Teel, the only 110-foot patrol boats to experience significant hull 
cracking, buckling and other problems that have led Admiral Allen to take them out 
of service are those that your company modified into 123-foot vessels. Yet, you claim 
that the fault lies with the Coast Guard and not with your company. How can that 
be? 

Answer.  It  is  incorrect  that  only  the  123s  have  experienced  hull  cracking  and 
buckling  that  have  restricted  operational  effectiveness.  Hull  cracking  and  buckling 
remains  a  recurring  issue  for  the  110  fleet.  By  2001,  the  Coast  Guard  recognized 
that  hull  cracking  and  buckling  presented  a  fleet-wide  problem,  and  identified  the 
need to undertake a comprehensive Hull Sustainment Program in order to maintain 
existing  operational  hours.  Similarly,  repairs  of  deck  cracks  on  the  aging  110′  ves-
sels became commonplace. The Coast Guard SLEB report, issued in 2002 before the 
eight  patrol  craft  were  converted,  further  recognized  the  deteriorated  condition  of 
the 110′ hulls and recommended the comprehensive repair of hull plating to improve 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00135 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

132 

the readiness of the fleet. For example, the SLEB report identified four 110s requir-
ing  repairs  for  buckled  hull  plating.  The  Coast  Guard  has  confined  the  110s  to  re-
stricted  operations  due  to  fleet-wide  structural  problems.  The  cost  of  this  Hull 
Sustainment  Program  was  estimated  at  approximately  $7  million  per  vessel.  The 
Deepwater proposal to convert the 110 fleet at $8 million per vessel involved a simi-
lar  hull  plating  replacement  approach,  but  also  included  a  new  deck  house,  stern 
launch boat ramp, improved berthing quarters, and a fully integrated C4ISR system. 
A  Coast  Guard  memorandum  dated  March  14,  2003  also  noted  the  deteriorated 
condition  of  the  110′  hulls.  Based  on  the  SLEB  Report  and  a  continued  pattern  of 
emergent  casualties,  the  memorandum  requested  that  the  Deepwater  Program  Ex-
ecutive Office develop a plan to address hull sustainment deficiencies. 

In short, the 123s are not the only vessels to experience hull buckling and crack-
ing. Moreover, Northrop Grumman does not ‘‘claim that the fault lies with the Coast 
Guard’’  for  the  123s.  Northrop  Grumman  is  working  collaboratively  with  the  Coast 
Guard to identify and resolve the cause(s) of the cracking/buckling. Until this work 
is completed, it would be premature to judge or assign fault. 

Question  12.  Didn’t  Northrop  have  an  opportunity  to  inspect  the  110-foot  cutters 
before it presented the solution of extending these to 123 feet? 
Answer.  While  no  opportunity  to  examine  the  110′  vessels  was  offered  by  the 
Coast  Guard  prior  to  contract  award,  Bollinger  was  permitted  to  inspect  the  110′ 
cutter  FARALLON  after  contract  award.  This  inspection  did  not  call  into  question 
the  viability  of  the  conversion  approach,  but  instead  confirmed  the  approach.  The 
SLEB  Report  prepared  by  the  Coast  Guard  involved  a  complete  review  of  the  110 
fleet,  confirmed  the  belief  that  the  110′  structural  deficiencies  could  be  addressed 
by  renewing  corroded  plating  and  structure.  In  fact,  the  SLEB  Report  made  ref-
erence  to  the  upcoming  123′  conversion  effort,  which  would  utilize  the  hull  repair 
approach recommended by the SLEB. 

Question 13. After the first converted boat, the MATAGORDA, developed a major 
hull  crack,  did  Northrop  conduct  a  thorough  structural  review  of  the  other  seven 
110′ cutters before it modified them? 

Answer. As discussed above, following the buckling of the MATAGORDA, an engi-
neering  tiger  team  was  formed  consisting  of  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman 
personnel. This team was dispatched to investigate the problem and discovered that 
the  MATAGORDA  had  a  legacy  workmanship  issue  in  an  unwelded  110′  deck 
stringer  that  existed  prior  to  the  conversion  and  contributed  to  the  hull  buckling. 
The  MATAGORDA  issue  arose  in  September  2004,  after  all  8  hulls  had  entered 
the conversion program and the first 4 hulls had been delivered. All 123s, including 
delivered  vessels  and  vessels  undergoing  conversion,  were  examined,  and  an 
unwelded stringer was also found on one additional hull undergoing conversion. 

When  modeled  using  finite  element  analysis,  the  stresses  in  the  panels  which 
failed on MATAGORDA were significantly higher than the stresses shown when the 
model was run with this stringer intact. This indicated that the structural integrity 
of  the  123′  hull  was  satisfactory  and  that  the  primary  cause  of  the  MATAGORDA 
buckling  was  a  110′  legacy  workmanship  issue  unrelated  to  the  structural  design. 
Although  the  MATAGORDA  buckling  was  believed  to  be  a  pre-conversion  work-
manship  issue,  Northrop  Grumman  and  the  Coast  Guard  proactively  evaluated 
methods  to  enhance  the  123′  structure.  To  further  improve  the  structural  integrity 
of  the  123s,  Northrop  Grumman  (working  with  Bollinger)  and  the  Coast  Guard  in-
stalled  three  stiffener  bands  on  all  eight  ships;  one  at  the  upper  edge  of  the  side 
shell,  one  below  this  one  and  another  on  the  edge  of  the  main  deck  to  increase  the 
overall  structural  strength.  While  the  finite  element  analysis  and  conventional  cal-
culations both agreed that the original hull, with the stringer under the deck intact, 
should be sufficient throughout the expected operating range of the 123s, these addi-
tional stiffeners were considered to provide an added margin of strength. The three 
stiffener  bands  were  added  to  all  the  123s  and  both  Northrop  Grumman  and  the 
Coast  Guard  believed  that  any  structural  issues  would  be  overcome  by  the  addi-
tional structural reinforcement. 

Question 14. Why did Northrop Grumman award itself the design for the Fast Re-
sponse  Cutter?  GAO  found  that  Northrop  did  not  have  any  significant  experience 
in designing such a cutter. Is that accurate? 

Answer.  Northrop  Grumman  did  not  ‘‘award  itself  the  design’’  for  the  FRC.  The 
ICGS proposal selected by the Coast Guard identified Bollinger as the designer and 
builder of the FRC. With the advent of new post-9/11 mission requirements and the 
acceleration  of  the  FRC  acquisition  by  10  years,  the  original  proposed  FRC  design 
approach  was  modified  (with  Coast  Guard  approval)  from  a  steel  to  composite  hull. 
The  composite  hull  was  then  proposed  following  a  business  case  analysis,  which 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00136 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

133 

showed  substantial  savings  resulting  from  not  having  to  replace  the  hull  for  35–40 
years. 

Unlike  other  domestic  shipyards,  Northrop  Grumman  has  both  prior  composite 
shipbuilding  experience  and  experience  in  the  design  and  construction  of  vessels 
comparable to the FRC. During the mid-1990s, Northrop Grumman constructed four 
composite  188-foot  U.S.  Navy  mine-hunting  vessels  at  its  Gulfport  Facility,  where 
the composite FRC vessels were to be constructed. 

Northrop  Grumman  also  has  designed  and  built  composite  products  for  marine 
applications.  The  Navy  mine  hunters  were  constructed  of  composite  materials  and 
built  to  very  demanding  specifications.  The  Navy  vessels  were  shock  rated  and  in-
corporated  special  features  to  meet  stringent  noise  criteria  requirements.  The  ves-
sels are still in the U.S. Navy fleet today. In addition, the Advanced Enclosed Moni-
toring/Sensing (AEM/S) System constructed by Northrop Grumman and installed on 
the USS RADFORD involved composite materials for weight reduction, reduced sig-
natures  and  an  overall  decrease  in  maintenance  requirements.  The  AEM/S  led  to 
the  development  of  the  large  composite  mast  for  the  LPD  class  ships  currently 
under  construction  by  Northrop  Grumman.  Moreover,  Office  of  Naval  Research 
(ONR)  programs  performed  by  Northrop  Grumman,  such  as  the  Composite  Helo 
Hangar,  helped  develop  design  and  construction  techniques  for  numerous  applica-
tions, including the all-composite DDG 1000 topside structure and the CVN 77 com-
posite mast. The Composite High Speed Vessel (CHSV) program, sponsored by ONR, 
demonstrated  readiness  and  acceptability  of  an  all-composite  high-speed  naval  ves-
sel. 

In  short,  Northrop  Grumman  possesses  considerable  expertise  in  the  design  and 
construction of composite vessels similar to that proposed for the FRC and has thor-
oughly validated the use of composite technology for marine vessels. 

Question  15.  You  seem  to  attribute  the  problems  with  the  Fast  Response  Cutter 
to  the  Coast  Guard  demanding  too  many  capabilities,  but  wasn’t  Northrop  respon-
sible for the design? 

Answer.  Northrop  Grumman  is  responsible  for  designing  the  FRC  in  accordance 
with  the  requirements  established  by  the  Coast  Guard.  An  updated  and  new  set  of 
Coast  Guard  post-9/11  capabilities  combined  with  a  design-to-cost  cap  resulted  in  a 
non-traditional  hull  form  outside  customary  hull  dimensions  in  legacy  patrol  boats. 
An  independent  analysis  of  the  FRC  preliminary  design  confirmed  that  the  non-
traditional hull form was driven by post-9/11 requirements, including enhanced sta-
bility, a 3,000 hour annual OPTEMPO, a 50 square foot/person gross area, a 25 per-
cent Search and Rescue and Operations fuel margin, and a 30 percent electric power 
margin for future growth. 

A  series  of  business  case  analyses,  total  ownership  cost  studies  and  preliminary 
design efforts showed the benefits of using a composite hull design to meet this de-
manding set of requirements with a potential to save over $1B in lifecycle costs. 

An  independent  third-party  analysis  also  confirmed  that  Northrop  Grumman’s 
FRC  design  appears  to  meet  or  is  capable  of  meeting  all  of  its  design  and  perform-
ance requirements. Northrop Grumman does not believe that FRC design is invalid 
because  the  Coast  Guard  has  ‘‘demand[ed]  too  many  capabilities.’’  Rather,  the  na-
ture  and  extent  of  the  post-9/11  requirements  exceeded  typical  patrol  boat  practice 
for  ship  size  and  displacement  and  led  to  a  non-traditional  ship  design.  Northrop 
Grumman believes the FRC design, while non-traditional, is sound and meets Coast 
Guard requirements. 

Question  16.  The  Commandant  has  now  made  a  decision  to  compete  the  design 
and  the  build  of  the  Fast  Response  Cutter—but  only  years  after  your  company  set 
out  to  design  it  yourself.  What  exact  steps  did  you  take  to  consider  the  merits  of 
competing either the design or the construction of this vessel? 

Answer.  To  our  knowledge,  the  Coast  Guard  has  not  decided  to  compete  the  de-
sign  and  construction  of  every  type  FRC  that  it  may  procure.  Rather,  the  Coast 
Guard  has  decided  only  to  conduct  a  competition  for  a  limited  number  of  FRC–B 
vessels  which  will  function  as  an  interim  measure  until  the  fully  capable  FRC 
(FRC–A)  can  be  fielded.  The  FRC–B,  which  will  be  based  upon  an  existing  patrol 
boat  and  based  upon  Coast  Guard  and  industry  surveys,  will  not  satisfy  many  of 
the Coast Guard’s requirements. 

As  stated  previously,  Northrop  Grumman  did  not  intend  or  originally  propose  to 
design the FRC itself. Northrop Grumman originally proposed that Bollinger would 
design  and  construct  the  FRC  with  a  steel  hull.  The  Coast  Guard  accelerated  FRC 
design and construction by 10 years. The expanded post-9/11 requirements produced 
a set of required capabilities that exceeded the existing roles filled by the 110s and 
123s  and  other  worldwide  patrol  boat  fleets,  and  led  to  the  consideration  of  a  new 
design  based  upon  a  composite  hull  design.  Having  marine  composite  experience, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00137 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

134 

Northrop  Grumman  proposed  and  the  Coast  Guard  agreed  to  proceed  with  a  com-
posite vessel. 

The current patrol boat acquisition strategy includes two paths to address the pa-
trol boat mission hour gap in light of the acceleration of the FRC. In the near term, 
FRC–B  (interim)  will  be  awarded  through  a  competitive  acquisition  process.  Nor-
throp  Grumman  will  not  be  competing  for  the  FRC–B  design  work  and  the  Coast 
Guard  will  approve  the  ultimate  source  selection  decision.  In  the  long  term,  the 
Coast  Guard  will  decide  whether  and  when  to  issue  a  Delivery  Task  Order  to  pro-
cure a fully capable FRC–A. 

Question  17.  How  does  Northrop  decide  whether  to  go  with  an  originally-planned 

asset or look for alternatives that might lead to a competition? 

Answer. By way of relevant background, ICGS submitted a proposal in the initial 
and  current  phase  in  competition  against  other  industry  teams.  Our  proposal  con-
tained  discrete  CLINS  (Contract  Line  Items)  for  assets  and  services,  the  execution 
of which were proposed with a schedule and a cost. The Coast Guard converted the 
proposal  to  a  contract  which  contained  a  schedule  and  costed  CLINS  for  these  as-
sets.  Work  under  the  CLINS  could  be  (and  has  been)  ordered  by  the  Coast  Guard 
through their issuance of Delivery Task Orders to ICGS. Thus, the Coast Guard se-
lected  ICGS’s  competitive  solution.  Further,  the  Coast  Guard,  not  Northrop  Grum-
man, makes all decisions about whether to execute Delivery Task Orders or to con-
sider  other  alternatives.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  the  FRC,  the  Coast  Guard  ac-
celerated the delivery schedule by 10 years and imposed a significantly different set 
of  requirements.  As  there  was  not  a  ‘‘proposed  solution’’  in  the  contract  which  fit 
the  Coast  Guard’s  new  requirements,  Northrop  Grumman  looked  both  internally 
and externally for appropriate solutions and then presented a solution to the Coast 
Guard for consideration. 

Northrop  Grumman  has  in  place  a  detailed  set  of  procedures  governing  ‘‘make- 
or-buy’’  decisions,  and  strictly  follows  these  procedures  under  the  Deepwater  pro-
gram.  The  ‘‘make-or-buy’’  procedures  require  consideration  of,  among  other  things, 
the  effect  upon  price,  quality,  delivery  and  performance  of  the  prime  contract,  com-
petency,  expertise  and  capability  available  within  other  firms,  requirements  for  en-
hancing competition by broadening the base of potential competitors, and the oppor-
tunity  for  small  business  and  small  business  concerns  to  compete  for  subcontracts. 
As  Admiral  Allen  said  in  his  January  30,  2007  testimony  before  the  House  Sub-
committee  on  Coast  Guard  and  Maritime  Transportation,  ‘‘They  [ICGS]  deal  with 
hundreds  of  vendors  around  the  country  and  we’d  be  glad  to  make  that  available 
for the record, sir, including what work was directed to either Lockheed or Northrop 
Grumman. That is all transparent, sir.’’ 

Question 18. You have testified that the Fast Response Cutter did not fail a ‘‘tank 
test’’ that was conducted. But this is not the only design problem found by the Coast 
Guard and an independent review. Do you still think the Fast Response Cutter de-
sign that Northrop supplied is the right design for the Coast Guard? 

Answer.  As  stated  previously,  Northrop  Grumman  believes  that  the  FRC  design 
provides the most cost effective means to meet the requirements imposed on the ves-
sel  following  9/11  and  contract  award.  The  ‘‘design  problems’’  largely  center  on  the 
fact  that  the  hull  form  of  the  FRC  is  outside  typical  patrol  boat  parameters.  This 
non-traditional design was necessary to address the post-9/11 requirements that no 
existing patrol craft design was capable of satisfying. In particular, the FRC design 
contains  a  wide  beam,  which  is  driven  primarily  by  demanding  stability  require-
ments subsequently relaxed for FRC–B. In addition, the FRC designed by Northrop 
Grumman  includes  a  four  engine  propulsion  plant,  which  was  necessary  to  meet 
speed requirements while remaining within applicable design to cost constraints. 

The  Coast  Guard  is  reviewing  FRC–B  requirements  based  on  an  assessment  by 
Alion-JJMA  Science  and  Technology.  We  will  support  the  Coast  Guard’s  ultimate 
decisions in this regard. 

We agree with the independent third-party analysis by John J. McMullen and As-
sociates regarding Northrop’s proposed FRC design: ‘‘The review team believes that 
the  FRC  does  appear  to  meet  or  is  capable  of  meeting  the  requirements’’  and  ac-
knowledges  that  ‘‘[t]he  FRC  preliminary  design  represents  a  design  solution  to  a 
challenging set of requirements.’’

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

PHILIP A. TEEL 

Question  1.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  Inspector  General  concluded 
that  the  current  design  of  the  National  Security  Cutter  will  not  meet  contractual 
performance requirements. The modernization plan for the 110-foot patrol boats has 
resulted in eight ships that are now out of service, and Northrop Grumman has not 
produced  a  functional  design  for  the  Fast  Response  Cutter  yet.  Why  has  it  been  so 
difficult to deliver the assets that you outlined in your original proposal? 

Answer.  Northrop  Grumman  is  wholly  dedicated  to  the  Deepwater  Program  and 
takes very seriously its contractual obligations to the Coast Guard. There is no sin-
gle common factor associated with the aforementioned Deepwater issues. The issues 
associated  with  the  123s,  Fast  Response  Cutter  and  National  Security  Cutter  are 
addressed below in more detail. 
National Security Cutter 

The contract contains a 30-year service life requirement for the NSC and the ves-
sel  as  designed  will  meet  this  requirement.  As  required  by  the  contract,  Northrop 
Grumman  designed  the  NSC  in  accordance  with  proven  U.S.  Navy  Design  Data 
Sheets.  In  fact,  the  NSC  design  is  structurally  more  sound  than  required  under 
these Navy standards. 

The DHS IG’s conclusions were not based upon the most current program and de-
sign  information.  The  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  agree  that  there  is  no 
safety  issue  or  operational  restrictions  associated  with  the  current  NSC  design.  In 
his January 30, 2007 testimony before the House Subcommittee on Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation, Commandant Allen stated, ‘‘There has never been a ques-
tion of safety related to the ship’s structure, nor have we ever anticipated any oper-
ational restrictions related to its design.’’ In addition, the American Bureau of Ship-
building (ABS) has certified the structural design drawings of the NSC. 

The  discussions  between  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  engineers  on  the 
NSC relate to fatigue-life. Fatigue-life and service life are two different concepts. Fa-
tigue-life  refers  to  the  amount  of  time  prior  to  the  onset  of  cracks  in  structurally 
significant  elements  in  the  vessel.  When  cracking  occurs,  appropriate  repairs  are 
performed. While some degree of cracking is expected during the life of a vessel, de-
termining the length of time between ship delivery and the onset of cracking is not 
an  exact  science.  Service  life,  in  contrast,  is  the  amount  of  time  in  which  repairs 
of  cracks  and  other  conditions  in  the  vessel  remain  economically  viable  to  perform 
in order to keep the ship in service. Unlike service life, fatigue-life is not a contract 
requirement.  The  Naval  Surface  Warfare  Center,  Carderock  Division  (Navy 
Carderock)  performed  an  analysis  of  the  predicted  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC  using  a 
model  which  was  not  benchmarked  using  valid  historical  data  and  realistic  oper-
ating  conditions.  When  properly  benchmarked,  a  53.8  year  fatigue-life  is  predicted 
for  the  NSC  design.  The  differing  fatigue-life  analyses  have  resulted  in  a  dialogue 
between  engineers  which  will  lead  to  a  final  determination  on  the  need  for  any  en-
hancements to further extend fatigue-life. 

Although  not  required  by  contract,  Northrop  Grumman  has  undertaken  the  re-
sponsibility  for  working  with  the  Coast  Guard  and  Navy  Carderock  to  achieve  con-
sensus on the predicted and desired fatigue-life of the NSC. Northrop Grumman has 
been  involved  in  extensive  analyses  and  dialogue  with  government  engineers  to  re-
solve these issues to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard. 
123 Conversion 

ICGS proposed the 123′ conversion as an appropriate means to provide the Coast 
Guard  with  the  necessary  capability  to  meet  its  mission  objectives  while  remaining 
within  the  confines  of  the  program  funding  requirements.  During  the  initial  Deep-
water  competition,  offerors  were  required  to  propose  a  set  of  specific  solutions  that 
did not exceed the funding limitation of $500 million per year. With new assets such 
as  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC),  Maritime  Patrol  Aircraft  (MPA)  and  the 
Vertical  Unmanned  Air  Vehicle  (VUAV)  being  developed  early  in  the  program,  it 
was  not  possible  to  design,  develop  and  construct  new  patrol  boats  at  program  in-
ception  while  keeping  within  those  annual  funding  limitations.  An  interim  solution 
was proposed. This interim solution was a modification to some of the Coast Guard’s 
existing  110-foot  vessels  to  123-foot  vessels  with  stern  launch  capability  to  satisfy 
many of the patrol boat requirements until a new design could be fielded. 
Our proposal to convert the 110′ vessels was based on information then available 
and  known  to  us.  Prior  to  proposal  submission,  Bollinger,  our  subcontractor  and 
original  builder  of  the  110s,  reviewed  Coast  Guard  surveys  of  major  structural  re-
pairs performed on the 110′ fleet. These surveys indicated that 110′ structural defi-

136 

ciencies, when present, were the result of corrosion and could be addressed by iden-
tifying  and  renewing  corroded  plating  and  structure.  This  information  was  con-
sistent with a Coast Guard report, dated March 8, 2002, prepared by the 110′ WPB 
Emergency  Service  Life  Evaluation  Board  (SLEB  Report).  The  SLEB  Report  stated 
that the 110′ hulls were in deteriorated condition but that the periodic repair of hull 
plating  would  improve  the  readiness  of  the  fleet.  Consistent  with  the  SLEB  Report 
and  the  Coast  Guard  surveys,  ICGS  determined  that  replacement  of  thin  hull  plat-
ing would be sufficient to overcome the deteriorated condition of the 110s. 

Following  contract  award,  but  before  any  conversion  work  began,  the  Coast 
Guard,  ICGS,  Northrop  Grumman,  and  Bollinger  conducted  a  Preliminary  Design 
Review, Critical Design Review, and Production Readiness Review of the 123′ design 
and  proposed  conversion  scope  of  work.  During  these  reviews,  ICGS  and  Northrop 
Grumman  presented  to  the  Coast  Guard  the  engineering  analyses  and  design  ap-
proach for the 123′ conversion effort. 
Unfortunately,  the  110′  vessels  delivered  for  conversion  were  in  worse  condition 
than  anticipated.  While  the  worse  than  expected  condition  of  the  ships  would  re-
quire  more  replacement  of  hull  plating,  the  Coast  Guard,  Northrop  Grumman,  and 
Bollinger  did  not  believe  that  the  viability  of  the  conversion  approach  was  in  ques-
tion. 

Following  the  buckling  on  the  MATAGORDA,  a  joint  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop 
Grumman tiger team discovered that the vessel had a pre-existing 110 workmanship 
issue at the location of the hull buckling. Specifically, a hidden, unwelded aluminum 
deck  stringer  was  discovered  immediately  beneath  the  area  where  the  failure  oc-
curred.  All  eight  123s  were  examined,  and  an  unwelded  stringer  was  found  on  one 
additional hull undergoing conversion. When modeled using finite element analysis, 
the stresses in the panels which failed on the MATAGORDA were significantly high-
er than the stresses shown when the model was run with this stringer intact. Based 
on  this  finding,  the  ICGS  and  Coast  Guard  believed  this  to  be  the  primary  cause 
of the buckling on MATAGORDA, and repairs were made accordingly. 

In an effort to further improve the structural integrity of the 123s, three stiffener 
bands  were  installed;  one  at  the  upper  edge  of  the  side  shell,  one  below  this  one 
and  another  on  the  edge  of  the  main  deck  to  increase  the  overall  structural 
strength.  While  the  finite  element  analysis  and  conventional  calculations  both 
agreed that the original hull, with the stringer under the deck intact, should be suf-
ficient  throughout  the  expected  operating  range  of  the  123s,  these  additional  stiff-
eners  were  considered  to  provide  an  added  margin  of  strength.  The  three  stiffener 
bands were added to all the 123s. 
Northrop Grumman has been committed to and remains committed to identifying 
the  root  causes  of  the  123′  structural  issues.  After  learning  of  the  MATAGORDA 
buckling  in  mid-September  2004,  Northrop  Grumman  immediately  began  a  review 
of all available information and reports on the incident. Northrop Grumman formed 
a  Tiger  Team  with  the  Coast  Guard  Engineering  Logistics  Center  (ELC),  Bollinger 
Shipyards,  and  ICGS  to  investigate  the  cracking  and  buckling  problems  that  had 
occurred on this vessel during its transit run away from Hurricane Ivan. The Tiger 
Team investigation occurred between September 2004 and January 2005. 
As  part  of  the  Tiger  Team  effort,  Downey  Engineering  performed  finite  element 
analyses  of  the  123′,  which  modeled  the  converted  hull.  In  addition  to  these  anal-
yses,  Northrop  Grumman  performed  hull  girder  section  modulus  calculations  and 
longitudinal  strength  calculations.  Despite  these  extensive  analyses  and  calcula-
tions,  the  Tiger  Team  was  not  able  to  correlate  the  problems  actually  experienced 
on  the  vessel  based  on  the  reported  sea  states.  Northrop  Grumman  also  retained 
Stress  Engineering  Services,  Inc.  to  conduct  metallurgical  testing  between  August 
2006  and  February  2007.  This  testing  revealed  an  issue  on  the  main  deck  that  ex-
ists on the 123s and across the entire legacy 110′ fleet. Northrop Grumman also col-
lected data on shaft alignment and maintenance procedures both during the conver-
sion and since, so that the procedures for checking and correcting alignment can be 
validated for both the 110′ and the 123′. Elements of the 123′ design, including the 
propellers and the stern-launch system, are being reexamined and validated. 

The Coast Guard ELC commissioned its own finite element analysis, which at the 
time  was  not  shared  with  Northrop  Grumman.  In  February  2006,  NGSS  offered  to 
perform a comprehensive engineering assessment at no cost to the Coast Guard. The 
Coast  Guard  declined  the  offer  with  the  exception  of  some  metallurgical  testing.  In 
early  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  ELC  conducted  additional  testing  and  analysis  on  the 
123s.  Northrop  Grumman  was  not  provided  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  this 
testing. In fact, it was not until January 2007, that the Coast Guard began to share 
the  test  results  with  Northrop  Grumman.  Since  that  time,  however,  the  Coast 
Guard is now sharing their test data with Northrop Grumman so it can be analyzed 
in conjunction with all of the other test data.

137 

In summary, Northrop Grumman has assumed responsibility for working with the 
Coast  Guard  to  understand  the  structural  issues  experienced  on  the  123s,  and  has 
devoted, and will continue to devote, significant resources to this effort well beyond 
our contractual obligations. 
Fast Response Cutter 

ICGS  and  Northrop  Grumman  originally  proposed  a  Fast  Response  Cutter  (FRC) 
with a steel hull design. Following contract award, substantial post-9/11 changes in 
the  Coast  Guard’s  mission  and  requirements  resulted  in  a  set  of  required  capabili-
ties  that  exceeded  traditional  patrol  boat  functions.  As  a  consequence,  the  steel  de-
sign  originally  proposed  by  ICGS  and  Northrop  Grumman  did  not  satisfy  the  new 
and expanded requirements of the Coast Guard. In addition, the Coast Guard accel-
erated the delivery requirement for the FRC by 10 years. 

To meet the expanded post-9/11 requirements and accelerated schedule, Northrop 
Grumman  conducted  trade  studies,  the  results  of  which  indicated  that  a  composite 
hull  would  best  serve  the  Coast  Guard’s  new  post-9/11  mission  requirements.  One 
major consideration was that the composite FRC would result in approximately $1B 
in life cycle cost savings. The Coast Guard then elected to pursue the composite ap-
proach  with  a  design-to-cost  limit.  This  design-to-cost  approach  became  a  ‘‘produc-
tion  cost  cap’’  but  no  requirements  trade-offs  were  accepted  by  the  Coast  Guard. 
These  performance  requirements  coupled  with  the  cost  cap  resulted  in  a  shortened 
vessel length (increasing length increases cost) and wider beam (to accommodate re-
quirements)  than  traditional  patrol  boat  hull  dimensions.  A  worldwide  survey 
proved that no existing patrol boat could satisfy the full set of requirements. 

The  Coast  Guard  and  industry  each  conducted  analyses  of  the  FRC  design  and 
the  best  value  approach  for  meeting  Coast  Guard  operational  requirements.  Nor-
throp  Grumman  is  not  aware  of  any  Coast  Guard  determination  that  the  FRC  de-
sign  is  ‘‘unsuited’’  for  its  post-9/11  mission  requirements.  To  the  contrary,  an  inde-
pendent  study  hired  by  the  Coast  Guard  has  confirmed  the  ability  of  the  proposed 
FRC design to meet the challenging Coast Guard operational requirements. 

Currently,  the  Coast  Guard  is  sponsoring  an  independent  business  case  analysis 
to  determine  if  a  steel  or  composite  hull  design  is  most  cost  effective.  Northrop 
Grumman analysis has shown that the service life of a composite hull will be consid-
erably longer than a traditional steel hull. While Northrop Grumman stands behind 
its  FRC  design,  it  will  support  the  Coast  Guard’s  ultimate  decision  in  this  matter. 
Question 2. Do you believe the current contract is working? Are there aspects that 
you  believe  should  be  changed  to  ensure  the  Coast  Guard  receives  state-of-the-art 
assets that meet the performance requirements of the Coast Guard, at a reasonable 
cost? 

Answer. The Deepwater Program is working and has delivered value to the Coast 
Guard  which  includes  HH–65  engine  upgrades,  legacy  cutter  communication  suite 
upgrades,  C–130J  missionization,  and  other  enhancements  that  have  markedly  im-
proved  Coast  Guard  operations.  It  cannot  be  forgotten  that  the  program  began  be-
fore 9/11, and that the events of 9/11 have caused the Coast Guard to substantially 
change  its  mission  requirements  and  the  requirements  for  assets  associated  with 
carrying  out  these  new  and  substantially  increased  mission  requirements.  Further, 
the Coast Guard is now part of the Department of Homeland Security. Such changes 
have  stressed  an  infrastructure  not  originally  designed  for  the  post-9/11  world.  In 
a post-9/11 world that must now move at a vastly increased pace, the Coast Guard, 
ICGS,  Northrop  Grumman,  Lockheed  Martin  and  many  other  contractors  which 
support our Government’s post-9/11 mission needs are and will encounter organiza-
tional changes and operational changes to achieve the demands of this new environ-
ment.  The  answer  to  such  requirements  is  an  even  greater  need  to  work  collabo-
ratively and to develop the contract and organizational structures necessary to sup-
port this collaboration. 

The  recent  steps  announced  by  Admiral  Allen  to  re-align  functions  within  the 
Coast  Guard  to  provide  greater  oversight  and  responsiveness  to  address  procure-
ment  management  and  technical  issues  will  certainly  address  many  of  the  Deep-
water acquisition issues. This approach will yield benefits and significantly enhance 
the ability of the Deepwater Program to deliver the assets and support our Nation’s 
needs to address post-9/11 mission requirements. 

Several weeks ago, Commandant Allen met with Northrop Grumman CEO Ronald 
Sugar  and  Lockheed  Martin  CEO  Robert  Stevens  in  the  first  of  a  planned  series  of 
meetings to discuss near and long-term objectives and goals for the Deepwater Pro-
gram.  As  an  outcome,  ICGS  and  the  Coast  Guard  recently  developed  a  Statement 
of Strategic Intent to provide a management framework for developing the way for-
ward  on  the  Deepwater  Program.  In  addition,  the  Statement  of  Strategic  Intent  is

water mission.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TRENT LOTT TO 

PHILIP A. TEEL 

Question 1. Please explain the difference between the Naval Surface Warfare Cen-
ter—Carderock Division’s (NSWC–CD) fatigue-life analysis method and inputs used 
for  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC)  and  the  ship  design  methods  and  calcula-
tions  traditionally  used  to  design  Navy  combatants  and  Coast  Guard  cutters.  How 
does  the  NSWC–CD  fatigue-life  prediction  for  the  NSC  compare  to  proven  hulls 
using the same model and inputs? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  performance  specifications  required  Northrop  Grum-
man to design and construct the NSC in accordance with the Cutter Specific Certifi-
cation Matrix (CSCM). The NSC CSCM did not impose any new or additional oper-
ational  requirements,  but  provided  the  standards  for  verification  that  the  perform-
ance requirements are met. 

The  CSCM  incorporated  Design  Data  Sheets,  which  are  widely  accepted  within 
the  shipbuilding  industry  as  the  ‘‘traditional  approach’’  to  design  and  build  ships. 
For  decades,  the  Design  Data  Sheet  approach  has  produced  successful  designs  over 
a  wide  range  of  vessels.  This  approach  implies  an  acceptable  fatigue-life  and  long- 
term ship performance based on a reasonable level of maintenance. Northrop Grum-
man has used the Data Design Sheet approach in the design of numerous Navy ves-
sels and the NSC design is structurally more sound than required under these Navy 
standards. 

The contract contains a 30-year service life requirement for the NSC and the ves-
sel  as  designed  will  meet  this  requirement.  The  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grum-
man  agree  that  there  are  no  safety  or  structural  issues  nor  are  there  any  oper-
ational restrictions associated with the current NSC design. In his January 30, 2007 
testimony before the House Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transpor-
tation,  Commandant  Allen  stated,  ‘‘There  has  never  been  a  question  of  safety  re-
lated  to  the  ship’s  structure,  nor  have  we  ever  anticipated  any  operational  restric-
tions  related  to  its  design.’’  In  addition,  in  a  March  2007  article  in  the  U.S.  Naval 
Institute’s  Proceedings  magazine,  Admiral  Blore  was  quoted  as  stating  that  ‘‘there 
is  not  a  structural  issue  with  the  National  Security  Cutter.  It’s  a  great  robust  de-
sign’’ . . . and there is no ‘‘safety issue.’’ In addition, the American Bureau of Ship-
building (ABS) has certified the structural design drawings of the NSC. 

The  discussions  between  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  engineers  on  the 
NSC  relate  to  fatigue-life.  Unlike  service  life,  fatigue-life  is  not  a  contract  perform-
ance  requirement.  The  Naval  Surface  Warfare  Center,  Carderock  Division  (Navy 
Carderock)  performed  an  analysis  of  the  predicted  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC  using  a 
model  not  benchmarked  or  based  upon  valid  historical  data  and  realistic  operating 
conditions.  Applying  the  Carderock  model  to  a  proven  hull  such  as  the  40-year-old 
Hamilton class, yields a fatigue-life prediction of three to 7 years. The same analysis 
model  run  on  the  30-year-old  DDG–2  predicted  a  fatigue-life  of  approximately  5 
years, demonstrating the insufficient benchmarking of the model. 

When  properly  benchmarked,  the  NSC  fatigue-life  is  predicted  to  be  nearly  54 
years.  The  differing  fatigue-life  analyses  have  resulted  in  a  dialogue  between  engi-
neers  which  will  lead  to  a  final  determination  on  the  need  for  any  enhancements 
to further extend fatigue-life. 

Although  not  required  by  contract,  Northrop  Grumman  has  been  involved  in  ex-
tensive analyses and dialogue with government engineers to resolve these issues to 
the satisfaction of the Coast Guard. 

Question 2. Please describe the modifications made to the original NSC design to 
accommodate Coast Guard concerns with the cutter’s structural strength. To the ex-
tent  that  these  modifications  will  be  different  between  NSCs  1–2  and  NSC  3  and 
beyond, please describe these differences. 

Answer.  Many  of  the  structural  items  raised  by  the  Coast  Guard  have  been  ad-
dressed and incorporated in the BERTHOLF and WAESCHE (NSC 1 and 2) during 
the  design  phase.  These  changes  are  now  in  the  baseline  design  for  all  NSC  ships. 
For  example,  upgraded  steel,  thicker  steel,  modifications  to  Fashion  Plates  and  Re- 
entrant  Corners,  and  the  addition  of  two  longitudinal  Hovgaard  bulkheads  to  pro-
vide  increased  stiffness  at  the  stern  were  incorporated  into  the  design.  Northrop 
Grumman also has made enhancements to address Coast Guard structural concerns 
with the design of the ship bottom. Northrop Grumman has further addressed struc-
tural  issues  raised  by  the  Coast  Guard  by  using  reduced  penetrations  in  the  deck 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00142 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

139 

stringer  plates  and  reinforcing  those  that  were  still  required  using  Navy  fatigue 
guidance criteria. 

These enhancements coupled with the post-9/11 mission requirements have added 
approximately 1,000 tons to the displacement, including a one-third increase in elec-
trical power systems, a tripling of air conditioning and ventilation capacity, the ad-
dition  of  25  antennas  and  a  26  percent  growth  in  the  size  of  the  berthing  spaces. 
These  changes  were  necessary  to  address  the  heightened  operational  requirements 
of the Coast Guard. None of these changes are related to the fatigue-life issue. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

PHILIP A. TEEL 

Question 1. The DHS OIG contends the National Security Cutter as currently de-
signed,  will  fail  to  live  up  to  Coast  Guard  mission  requirement  of  185  days  under-
way  over  its  30-year  life  span.  The  Coast  Guard  expresses  similar  concerns.  How-
ever,  ICGS  does  not  appear  to  agree  with  this  conclusion.  If  NSC  1  was  put  into 
service  without  any  of  structural  modifications  the  Coast  Guard  now  says  are  nec-
essary,  would  it  meet  the  contractual  performance  requirements  of  a  30-year  fa-
tigue-life assuming 185 underway days per year? 

Answer. Northrop Grumman continues to believe that the NSC meets the contract 
requirements  for  a  30-year  service  life.  There  is  no  contract  requirement  for  a  30- 
year  fatigue-life.  Both  the  Coast  Guard  and  Northrop  Grumman  agree  that  there 
are  no  safety  or  structural  issues  related  to  the  ship’s  design.  Nor  are  there  any 
operational restrictions associated with the current NSC design. The NSC structural 
design meets the 30-year service life requirements of the contract and ABS, the cer-
tifying  authority  for  NSC  structural  standards,  has  independently  certified  compli-
ance with these structural standards. 

The  issues  that  have  been  raised  between  the  engineers  relate  primarily  to  fa-
tigue-life,  an  extra-contractual  matter.  The  question  currently  being  addressed  by 
Northrop  Grumman  and  the  Coast  Guard  involves  the  fatigue-life  of  the  NSC  over 
its  30-year  service  life.  Fatigue-life  and  service  life  are  two  different  concepts.  Fa-
tigue-life  refers  to  the  amount  of  time  prior  to  the  onset  of  cracks  in  structurally 
significant  elements  in  the  vessel.  When  cracking  occurs,  appropriate  repairs  are 
performed. While some degree of cracking is expected during the life of a vessel, de-
termining the length of time between ship delivery and the onset of cracking is not 
an  exact  science.  Service  life,  in  contrast,  is  the  amount  of  time  in  which  repairs 
of  cracks  and  other  conditions  in  the  vessel  remain  economically  viable  to  perform 
in order to keep the ship in service. 

The 30-year service life of the ship was based on an assumption of 230 days away 
from  homeport,  a  number  that  includes  45  days  in  port  for  logistics  and  185  days 
away  from  port  and  underway.  The  ‘‘30-year  life’’  requirement  does  not  pertain  to 
fatigue-life. In determining fatigue-life, the controlling assumption is the amount of 
time the vessel spends in extreme sea states, not total days underway. This assump-
tion forms the basis for the differing engineering predictions of fatigue-life. Applying 
the Navy Carderock model to a proven hull such as the 40-year-old Hamilton class, 
yields  a  fatigue-life  prediction  of  three  to  7  years.  The  same  analysis  model  run  on 
the  30-year-old  DDG–2  predicted  a  fatigue-life  of  approximately  5  years,  dem-
onstrating the insufficient benchmarking of the model. When the model is calibrated 
in  accordance  with  Navy  fatigue-life  guidance  instructions,  and  realistic  real-world 
sea state conditions, the NSC fatigue-life is predicted to be nearly 54 years. We will 
continue  to  work  with  the  Coast  Guard  to  define  the  level  of  structural  enhance-
ment they desire. 

Question  1a.  Are  the  National  Security  Cutter  design  changes  and  structural  en-
hancements  requested  by  the  Coast  Guard  needed  to  meet  the  Deepwater  contract 
performance specifications? Please explain your reasoning. 

Answer. No. As discussed above, the NSC as designed meets the contract perform-
ance  requirements.  However,  the  Coast  Guard  has  requested  structural  enhance-
ments  based  on  a  concern  regarding  the  calculated  prediction  of  fatigue-life.  Nor-
throp  Grumman  and  Navy  Carderock  have  used  a  relatively  new  method  to  model 
the  predicted  NSC  fatigue-life  by  applying  different  approaches  to  existing  ship  de-
signs,  operational  characteristics  and  hull  form.  The  difference  in  the  two  ap-
proaches  relates  to  whether  the  model  is  benchmarked  using  historical  data  from 
ships that have operated in similar environments for long periods of time. The Navy 
Carderock performed their fatigue analysis by assuming that the NSC would spend 
100 percent of the time in specific locations known for very bad weather conditions. 
Based  upon  ‘‘real-world’’  operational  experiences  with  naval  vessels,  the  NSC  will 
encounter  a  variety  of  sea  states.  As  discussed  above,  when  the  analysis  assumes

140 

realistic real-world sea state conditions, the NSC fatigue-life is predicted to be near-
ly 54 years. 

To  the  extent  the  ongoing  discussions  with  the  Coast  Guard  result  in  the  Coast 
Guard  requiring  fatigue-related  structural  enhancements,  those  enhancements  will 
be provided consistent with Coast Guard requirements. 

Question  1b.  In  your  written  testimony  you  mention  that  there  has  been  an  ex-
traordinary  degree  of  transparency  in  the  Deepwater  program,  but  the  DHS  IG  re-
ports  that  it  was  refused  access  to  personnel  and  information  during  its  investiga-
tion of the NSC . . . what is your explanation for this discrepancy? 

Answer.  Throughout  the  course  of  the  Deepwater  Program,  ICGS  and  Northrop 
Grumman  have  participated  in  a  number  of  GAO  audits  and  have  supported  and 
participated in reviews by the Defense Acquisition University, and the Coast Guard 
Program  Management  Team.  In  connection  with  these  audits  and  reviews,  ICGS 
and  Northrop  Grumman  routinely  provided  support  for  audit  team  site  visits  to 
ICGS  facilities,  management  and  technical  staff  meetings  with  audit  teams,  brief-
ings  and  updates  to  auditors,  and  support  for  multiple  Coast  Guard  and  inde-
pendent  data  call  responses.  In  addition,  ICGS  has  provided  access  to  and  training 
on the ICGS electronic document system and numerous files and documents. 

Consistent  with  our  participation  in  these  audits,  and  consistent  with  the  Gen-
erally  Accepted  Government  Auditing  Standards  (GAGAS),  ICGS  and  its  member 
companies  offered  to  facilitate  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  Office  of  In-
spector  General  (DHS  OIG)  audit  by  making  personnel  available  for  interviews 
while  respecting  the  rights  of  our  employees.  Not  knowing  the  subject  of  the  audit 
or whether the audit related to or focused on ICGS or its member companies, ICGS 
requested in its February 17, 2006 letter that the OIG clarify the purpose and scope 
of the audit and, depending on its nature, to allow management or legal representa-
tion at interviews. The OIG neither acknowledged these requests nor sought to dis-
cuss how ICGS might facilitate their audit. The DHS OIG never contacted us again. 
ICGS  and  Northrop  Grumman  remain  committed  to  supporting  the  Coast  Guard, 
this Subcommittee and other agencies in their Deepwater oversight efforts. 

Question  2.  The  DHS G  Report  on  the  Acquisition  of  the  National  Security  Cutter 
(DHS G–07–23) states the Coast Guard allowed the Contractor to self-certify compli-
ance  with  the  standards.  In  the  footnotes  of  the  report  (page  14),  the  Deepwater 
Surface  Statement  of  Objectives  states,  ‘‘. . .  performance  specification  and  cutter 
specific  certification  matrix  are  certified  either  by  self-certification  or  by  an  inde-
pendent  agent,  except  that  the  contractor  shall  use  American  Bureau  of  Shipping 
(ABS) to certify compliance with ABS standards.’’ What are the practical differences 
and  implications  between  ABS  certification  and  ‘‘self-certification’’  with  ABS  certi-
fying compliance with ABS standards? 

Answer.  ICGS  does  not  self-certify  compliance  with  the  NSC  performance  speci-
fications,  but  is  required  to  verify  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Coast  Guard  that  the 
performance  specifications  have  been  achieved.  Verification  of  specification  compli-
ance  is  accomplished  through  testing,  examination,  analysis,  or  simulation.  The 
NSC  specifications  further  require  that  the  vessel  be  designed  and  constructed  in 
accordance with NSC Cutter Specific Certification Matrix (CSCM). The CSCM iden-
tifies  the  standards  to  be  followed  in  the  design  of  the  NSC,  and  compliance  with 
these CSCM standards must be certified. The NSC CSCM does not impose any new 
or  additional  operational  requirements;  but  provides  the  standards  for  verification 
that  the  existing  requirements  are  met.  The  CSCM  contains  line  items  (SORTS) 
that describe how certain systems are certified. The certification process culminates 
with  attesting  by  report,  letter  or  similar  documentation  that  the  attribute  or  per-
formance  of  the  equipment  or  system  meets  the  applicable  standards  of  the  CSCM. 
Any  deviations  from  these  standards  must  be  formally  approved  by  the  Coast 
Guard. 

Whether  ICGS  or  ABS  attests  to  compliance  with  CSCM  standards,  documenta-
tion  must  be  provided  which  is  verifiable.  The  ICGS  verification  process  for  the 
Coast  Guard  is  similar  to  the  verification  and  review  process  on  Navy  programs. 
ABS  certifies  to  the  CSCM  standards  through  review  of  design  drawings  and  sup-
porting  engineering  analyses,  and  their  efforts  may  include  their  own  analytical 
verifications.  ABS  specifies  to  Northrop  Grumman  the  design  products  to  be  sub-
mitted for review. ICGS develops its design in accordance with the CSCM using in-
dustry-accepted methods and produces associated documentation that is provided or 
available  to  the  Coast  Guard.  The  basic  design  along  with  this  documentation  un-
dergoes an internal review process within Northrop Grumman engineering to evalu-
ate  the  design  against  the  requirements  and  assess  the  validity  and  correctness  of 
the  analyses  and  solution.  In  addition,  the  Coast  Guard  participates  in  design  re-
views  during  the  entire  development  process  so  that  they  understand  the  technical

141 

decisions  proposed  or  made  by  ICGS/Northrop  Grumman  and  the  evolution  of  the 
design. Subsequent testing and trials complete the assessment of performance of the 
design against Coast Guard requirements. The Coast Guard retains the right to re-
view and accept or reject the work. 

Question 2a. Did Northrop Grumman Ship Systems or ICGS ‘‘self-certify’’ compli-
ance  with  the  design  standards  of  the  National  Security  Cutter  as  reported  in  the 
DHS G Report on the Acquisition of the National Security Cutter (DHS OIG–07–23)? 

Answer. Northrop Grumman does not self-certify compliance with the NSC struc-
tural  requirements  of  the  contract.  Rather,  the  Contract  specifically  requires  the 
contractor  to  verify  its  work  through  inspection  and  testing.  As  such,  Northrop 
Grumman  does  not  have  the  final  say  as  to  whether  an  asset  it  provides  meets  all 
contract  requirements.  Instead,  the  Coast  Guard  has  the  final  word  contractually 
as the Coast Guard has retained the right to review and accept or reject work. The 
NSC, similar to the naval vessels Northrop Grumman designs and builds, is subject 
to  a  comprehensive  external  certification  process.  For  the  NSC,  the  American  Bu-
reau  of  Shipbuilding  (ABS)  certified  14  Systems  Level  drawings,  including  struc-
tural design drawings. ABS will also certify 35 ship systems during this acceptance 
process. These include Command and Control Systems, Propulsion Plant, Machinery 
Monitoring  and  Control,  Fuel  Systems,  Anchoring  Systems,  and  Steering  Systems. 
Prior  to  or  in  conjunction  with  the  delivery  of  the  NSC  BERTHOLF,  there  will  be 
a total of 46 independent third-party certifications. These independent certifications 
include Final Aircraft Facilities, Flight Deck Status and Signaling, Navigation Sys-
tems,  Interior  Communications  Systems,  Guns  and  Ammunition  Weapons  System 
Safety,  DOD  Information  Security  and  Accreditation,  and  TEMPEST.  The  U.S. 
Navy  Board  of  Inspection  and  Survey  (INSURV)  will  conduct  the  Ship  Acceptance 
Trials (AT) when the cutter gets underway later this year. 

The NSC CSCM provided to ICGS by the Coast Guard permits ‘‘self-certification’’ 
of  design  standards  only  in  instances  ‘‘where  neither  ABS  nor  other  3rd  Party  cer-
tification  is  required.’’  However,  any  self-certification  must  be  supported  by  docu-
mentation,  such  as  Independent  Inspection  Reports  (IIRs),  Test  Inspection  Reports 
(TIRs),  and  Compartment  Completion  Inspection  Reports  (CCIR).  Even  in  such  in-
stances,  the  Coast  Guard  retains  the  right  to  review  and  accept  or  reject  such  re-
ports.  As  such,  it  is  ultimately  the  Coast  Guard,  not  ICGS  or  Northrop  Grumman, 
which  has  the  final  say,  contractually,  as  to  whether  the  Coast  Guard-provided 
standards have been met. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

PHILIP A. TEEL 

Question 1. Your testimony refers to the 2002 decision of the Coast Guard’s Serv-
ice  Life  Extension  Board  that  determined  that  systematic  hull  repairs  on  the  110′ 
vessels  was  the  solution  to  deterioration  problems.  Do  you  believe  that  the  conver-
sion complied with these recommendations? 
Answer. The 123′ conversion was consistent with the recommendations contained 
in  the  2002  110′  WPB  Emergency  Service  Life  Extension  Board  Report  (SLEB  Re-
port). The Coast Guard SLEB Report, issued before the eight patrol craft were con-
verted,  recognized  the  deteriorated  condition  of  the  110′  hulls,  and  concluded  that 
the  periodic  repair  of  hull  plating,  when  necessary,  would  improve  the  readiness  of 
the fleet. 
In  fact,  the  SLEB  Report  made  reference  to  the  upcoming  123′  conversion  effort, 
which would utilize the hull repair approach recommended by the SLEB. Under the 
123′ conversion plan, Bollinger, our subcontractor, conducted an ultrasonic examina-
tion  of  the  hull  plating  on  each  inducted  110′  and  replaced  any  plating  that  was 
less than 90 percent of its required thickness. Consistent with the SLEB Report and 
the  Coast  Guard  surveys  of  the  110s,  ICGS  believed  that  replacement  of  thin  hull 
plating  would  be  sufficient  to  overcome  the  deteriorated  condition  of  the  patrol 
boats. In this manner, the SLEB Report confirmed the belief that the 110′ structural 
deficiencies  could  be  addressed  by  renewing  corroded  plating  and  structure  during 
conversion. 

Question 2. Can you describe the role of the American Bureau of Shipping in the 
approval of the hulls on the MATAGORDA? 
Answer.  The  performance  specifications  require  that  the  123′  conversion  be  de-
signed and constructed in accordance with the 123′ Cutter Specific Certification Ma-
trix  (CSCM).  The  CSCM  identifies  the  standards  to  be  followed  in  the  design  and 
conversion to the 123′. The 123′ CSCM does not impose any new or additional oper-
ational  requirements,  but  provides  the  standards  for  verification  that  the  existing 
requirements  are  met.  The  CSCM  contains  line  items  (SORTS)  that  describe  how 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:05 Sep 01, 2010 Jkt 036402 PO 00000 Frm 00145 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\36402.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

142 

certain  systems  are  certified,  and  the  123′  is  designed  to  be  compliant  with  the  ap-
plicable  CSCM  standards.  Any  deviations  from  these  standards  must  be  formally 
approved by the Coast Guard. 
SORT  109,  General  Requirements  for  Hull  Structure,  and  SORT  113,  Shell  Plat-
ing,  in  the  CSCM  address  the  structural  design  requirements  for  the  123′  hull  ex-
tension. The areas addressed by these SORTS include the general requirements for 
hull structure and requirements for shell plating, respectively. SORTS 109 and 113 
adopt the 1997 American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building and Classing 
High  Speed  Craft.  The  general  requirements  of  SORT  109  were  applicable  to  new 
or  modified  structure  rather  than  the  entire  legacy  110′  hull.  The  method  of 
verification  of  compliance  with  the  ABS  standard  is  through  examination  by  ABS. 
During the period from August 25, 2003 to April 7, 2004, ABS examined the 123′ 
structural  design  and  reviewed  drawings  for  compliance  with  structural  design 
SORTS 109 and 113. Periodic visits were made by ABS during the course of the con-
version  to  verify  that  the  work  was  being  accomplished  in  accordance  with  the  ap-
proved  drawings.  On  April  7,  2004,  ABS  issued  a  Report  of  Survey  number 
MC510848–A, certifying that their inspectors examined the design and construction 
of  the  123′  for  compliance  with  the  approved  design.  The  report  specified  the  areas 
examined,  including  those  covered  by  SORTS  109  and  113,  and  certified  that  the 
123′ hull extension design complied with contractual ABS requirements. This certifi-
cation applies to all 123′ hulls, including the MATAGORDA. 

Question  3.  Could  you  comment  on  the  plan  to  provide  a  composite  hull  for  the 

FRC? Is this the right solution, and is it cost effective? 

Answer.  The  ICGS  proposal  selected  by  the  Coast  Guard  in  2002  identified 
Bollinger  as  the  designer  and  builder  of  the  FRC.  The  proposal  also  contemplated 
the FRC would not be awarded until 2018. The advent of new post-9/11 mission re-
quirements  coupled  with  the  Coast  Guard’s  desire  to  obtain  a  vessel  now  and  not 
years  later  to  meet  the  post-9/11  mission  requirements  resulted  in  the  FRC  being 
accelerated by 10 years. To meet the new post-9/11 mission requirements and to ad-
dress  a  longer  service  life  for  the  new  FRC,  Northrop  Grumman  conducted  a  busi-
ness case analysis and, as a result, proposed a low maintenance, long life composite 
hull.  The  composite  hull  that  was  then  proposed  showed  substantial  savings  (over 
$1B in life cycle cost) resulting from not having to replace the hull for 35–40 years. 
An  independent  third-party  analysis  also  confirmed  that  Northrop  Grumman’s 
FRC design appeared to meet or is capable of meeting all of its design and perform-
ance  requirements.  Northrop  Grumman  believes  the  FRC  design,  while  non-tradi-
tional, is sound and meets Coast Guard requirements. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

DR. LEO S. MACKAY 

Question  1.  ICGS  is  responsible  for  developing  the  assets  needed  for  the  Coast 
Guard’s  performance  requirements.  The  DHS  IG  found  that  the  Coast  Guard  re-
tained  very  little  authority  over  technical  decisions.  If  that  is  true,  and  a  design 
ends up being flawed, isn’t it the responsibility of ICGS? 

Answer. A design could be determined to have flaws for a number of reasons. The 
basic  requirements  from  which  the  design  was  developed  could  be  flawed  or  there 
could be errors made in the design process. An analysis must be performed to deter-
mine  the  nature  and  characteristics  of  a  suspected  design  flaw  as  well  as  the  root 
cause.  It  is  important  to  note  how  the  Deepwater  technical  approval  process  oper-
ates.  As  a  design  matures,  it  goes  through  a  full  set  of  formal  technical  review 
steps—preliminary design review (PDR), critical design review (CDR), test readiness 
review  (TRR),  and  production  readiness  review  (PRR)  are  the  main  features  of  the 
process. At each of these reviews a full complement of government and industry rep-
resentatives is present. ICGS makes recommendations to the Coast Guard and pre-
sents  data  that  confirms  how  the  design  achieves  all  conditions  for  current  step  in 
the  process  and  how  it  is  ready  to  progress  to  the  next  step  in  the  process.  The 
Coast  Guard  decides  and  approves  or  disapproves  progressing  to  the  next  step  in 
the  process.  This  process  has  been  in  place  since  inception  of  the  program  and  en-
ables the Coast Guard to decide the technical maturity of all designs. 

Question  2.  Do  you  know  of  any  examples  in  which  ICGS,  Lockheed  Martin,  or 
Northrop Grumman used the awarding of Deepwater subcontracts to industry part-
ners  as  a  means  to  leverage  other  potential  deals  or  contracts  for  Lockheed  Martin 
or Northrop Grumman? 

Answer.  I  can  answer  for  Lockheed  Martin.  There  were  no  subcontracts  awarded 
by  Lockheed  Martin  as  a  means  to  leverage  other  potential  deals  or  contracts  for 
Lockheed Martin.

Question  3.  Can  you  please  explain  the  advantages  of  using  a  systems  integrator 

as far as interoperability and total ownership cost are concerned? 

Answer.  Lockheed  Martin  is  using  System  Engineering  methodologies  to  accom-
plish  a  cost-effective  approach  to  integration  across  multiple,  geographically-dis-
persed  platforms.  This  complex  endeavor  requires  the  application  of  a  wide-range 
of  engineering  disciplines,  synchronized  to  program  timelines  and  objectives.  In  the 
context  of  Deepwater,  Systems  Integration  engineering  is  a  discipline  for  building 
complete systems by bringing together components from different sources so that all 
individual components together produce synergistic results not obtainable as stand- 
alone  subsystems.  Systematic  analysis  of  organizational,  technological,  and  oper-
ational  factors  using  these  systems  integration  techniques  and  tools  have  produced 
good results: 

• Minimization  of  the  cost  of  asset  acquisition,  operation  and  maintenance;  and 
• Maximization  of  assets’  ability  to  interoperate  with  each  other  as  well  as  with 

other agencies and departments. 

The Deepwater system of systems approach is achieving performance that is more 
than the sum of individual capabilities at lower costs than one-for-one replacement. 
The  Deepwater  engineering  team  has  also  achieved  a  high  level  of  reuse  of  off- 
the-shelf  items,  such  that  the  majority  of  the  program  software  has  already  been 
developed,  tested,  proven,  and  used  by  others.  Deepwater  has  avoided  nearly  $97M 
of  engineering  and  software  development  costs  in  addition  to  obviating  risks  of  cre-
ating new software. In addition, with interoperability designed in, the costs of test-
ing  performed  in  a  step-by-step  fashion  between  each  asset  are  precluded.  This 
would have entailed as much as an additional $145.5M for the broad range of Deep-
water assets being upgraded and deployed. 

Question 4. Isn’t it possible to integrate assets and equipment with common tech-

nology without use of a systems integrator? 

Answer.  We  believe  the  Deepwater  system  engineering  and  integration  approach 
described above is essential to achieve commonality and interoperability in an effec-
tive  and  efficient  manner.  Without  a  system-centric  approach  is  more  costly  and 
more risky to establish interoperability and commonality as well as control the total 
ownership costs of systems and assets. 

Question  5.  For  instance,  can’t  Lockheed  work  with  Coast  Guard  to  use  the  com-
munications and other systems on all of their assets without managing every aspect 
of the procurement? 

Answer.  Industry’s  performance  has  been  closely  supervised  by  the  Coast  Guard. 
All  designs  and  improvements  are  based  on  trade  studies,  analyses,  and  technical 
considerations. The Coast Guard is the decisionmaker and contracting authority and 
all  major  acquisition  decisions  are  reviewed  and  approved  by  Coast  Guard  senior 
leadership.  The  Deepwater  program  uses  the  depth  of  capabilities  and  experience 
of  its  industry  partners  to  provide  solutions  in  accordance  with  Coast  Guard  re-
quirements. The results so far indicate that Deepwater has made a difference in the 
effectiveness  of  the  Coast  Guard  with  regard  to  the  numbers  of  drug  seizures,  mi-
grant interdictions and lives saved. 

Question  6.  Dr.  Mackay,  the  GAO  has  described  Lockheed’s  ‘‘Open  Business 
Model’’  as  a  philosophy  and  not  a  requirement  for  competition.  Is  that  an  accurate 
description? 

Answer. The Open Business Model is part of the Lockheed Martin subcontracting 
process  that  helps  ensure  best  value  throughout  the  program.  It  involves  deferring 
down-select  decisions  as  long  as  practicable  to  avoid  guaranteed  work  share  to  a 
particular supplier. This helps facilitate thorough evaluations of the marketplace for 
the most appropriate products and services. Deepwater competition requirements on 
the  program  are  governed  by  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  52.244–5,  ‘‘Com-
petition in Subcontracting.’’ 

Question 7. How many RFPs have ICGS or the first-tier subcontractors (Lockheed 

and Northrop) issued for subcontracts under the Deepwater program? 

Answer. I can answer for Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin has issued approxi-
mately  2,400  Requests  for  Proposal  and  Requests  for  Quotation  since  the  program 
began. This value is an empirical calculation based on the number of suppliers cur-
rently  being  used  by  Lockheed  Martin  in  performance  of  the  Deepwater  program. 
There are presently 342 suppliers, including Lockheed Martin divisions and subsidi-
aries,  for  a  total  value  of  $745,392,640.  The  list  without  Lockheed  Martin  divisions 
and subsidiaries totals 334 suppliers for a total value of $688,299,176. 

Question 8. If you are a company that has an alternative product that has merit, 

what avenues exist for getting such products considered by ICGS?

proach adding value to the Coast Guard and the American people? 

Answer.  Systems  engineering  and  integration  balances  trade-offs,  refines  force 
configurations,  and  achieves  demanding  performance  goals  across  a  multiplicity  of 
mission  areas.  Systems  engineering  and  integration  touch  every  facet  of  the  Deep-
water  enterprise  including  human-capital  management,  information  technology,  air 
and  surface  platforms,  integrated  logistics;  command,  control,  communications  and 
computers;  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance;  and,  most  importantly, 
the fleet operator. 

The  systems  engineering  and  integration  discipline  facilitates  the  use  of  off-the- 
shelf  and  fielded  maritime  systems  to  maximize  commonality  and  interoperability. 
For  example,  the  National  Security  Cutter  (NSC)  is  using  75  percent  of  the  U.S. 
Navy’s Open Architecture Command and Decision System. The Medium Range Sur-
veillance aircraft Command and Control System is employing over 50 percent of the 
functionality  of  the  Navy’s  P–3  Anti-Surface  Warfare  Improvement  Program.  The

Question 9. The GAO in 2004 found that 40 percent of subcontracts were awarded 
by  Lockheed  and  Northrop  to  themselves.  Has  this  percentage  gone  up,  down,  or 
stayed about the same since then? 

Answer.  I  can  answer  for  Lockheed  Martin.  As  of  December  2006,  the  Lockheed 
Martin  purchasing  department  had  awarded  subcontracts  and  interdivisional  work 
transfers  totaling  $745,392,640.  Subcontracts  involve  awards  to  firms  outside  of 
Lockheed  Martin.  Interdivisional  work  transfers  involve  ‘‘subcontracts’’  to  entities 
within Lockheed Martin. The total value of $745,392,640 comprises $688,299,176 of 
subcontracts  and  $77,093,464  of  interdivisional  work  transfers.  Thus  the  value  of 
subcontracts  to  firms  outside  of  Lockheed  Martin  is  89.7  percent  of  the  total  value 
of all awards. 

Question 10. In your opinion, how is the Lead Systems Integrator contracting ap-

• Increased drug and illegal migrant interdiction, as well as increased lives saved 
due to the improved capabilities provided by the upgraded C4ISR systems. ‘‘The 
Deepwater  Upgrade  provides  vastly  improved  communications  and  interoper-
ability.  In  the  past  year  this  ship  has  operated  from  above  the  Arctic  Circle  to 
well  below  the  Equator.  We  have  enjoyed  24/7  real  time  links  to  operational 
commanders and database management regardless of our physical location. The 
upgrades  have  proven  to  be  tough,  dependable,  and  easily  maintained.’’— 
USCGC MORGENTHAU Commanding Officer 
• Increased  capability  in  the  HH–65C  helicopter  which  has  led  to  safer  missions 
for  Coast  Guard  aviation  personnel  as  well  as  more  lives  saved  with  faster 
speed, twice the endurance and twice the payload. The more powerful HH–65C 
helicopters  flew  85  sorties  and  saved  305  lives  following  Hurricane  Katrina.  It 
was  not  uncommon  for  the  modernized  helicopter  to  hoist  twice  the  number  of 
people  and  remain  on  station  for  twice  as  long  as  older  and  less-reliable  Bravo 
models.  ‘‘It’s  a  beautiful  bird,  I  was  a  co-pilot  for  Hurricane  Katrina;  we  were 
able to carry more fuel and fit into tighter landing zones with less fear of losing 
an engine.’’—HH–65C pilot Air Station Atlantic City 
• Two  new  HC–144  Maritime  Patrol  Aircraft  have  been  delivered  under  Deep-
water and are undergoing C4ISR mission package installation to make these the 
most capable aircraft in the Coast Guard’s aviation history. The C–130J aircraft 
is  being  outfitted  with  interoperable  mission  packages  for  long  range  surveil-
lance.  It  is  undergoing  extensive  modifications  including  installation  of  belly- 
mounted surface search radar, nose-mounted electro-optical infrared sensor and

a  flight  deck  mission  operator  station.  The  project  was  assigned  to  Deepwater 
to ensure integration and interoperability with all new and existing aviation as-
sets, including its legacy fleet of C–130H aircraft. 
• Work continues to develop logistics support for the Maritime Patrol Aircraft and 
National Security Cutter. Construction is well underway on the C4ISR training 
suite at Training Center Petaluma, CA, and MPA Hangar at Aviation Training 
Center Mobile, AL. 

Question 11. Do you have any idea what the total costs above the original contract 
price are that can be attributed to change orders by the Coast Guard once they were 
locked in to a design that did not serve their needs? 

Answer. Changes in the technical baseline from June 2002 were the result of post- 
9/11  new  mission  requirements  including  clarifications  of  specifications  to  meet 
asset  performance  capabilities.  As  such,  the  Coast  Guard  presented  a  revised  pro-
gram  baseline  to  Congress  of  $24B/25  years  versus  the  original  plan  of  $17B/20 
years to account, in large part, for these changes. 

Question  12.  Will  the  logistics  system  that  ICGS  is  to  deliver  under  the  contract 
be ready for the NSC 1 when it becomes operational? What about for all other Deep-
water  assets?  Exactly  what  have  you  provided  to  the  Coast  Guard  at  this  point  on 
your logistics plan? 

Answer. The current contractual work to develop and deploy the Logistics System 
for NSC 1 is fully funded and being carried out against an approved baseline sched-
ule.  ICGS  is  currently  on  plan  to  deliver  an  operating  Logistics  System,  as  evi-
denced  in  various  status  reports.  The  Coast  Guard  has  recently  opened  discussion 
with  ICGS  to  redefine  the  processes  of  Logistics  support  for  NSC  1,  including  roles 
and  responsibilities  for  Coast  Guard  logistics  infrastructure  commands.  Some  of 
these  discussions  may  result  in  contractual  changes,  but  ICGS  is  committed  to  en-
suring the best Logistics sustainment infrastructure is in place for NSC 1. ICGS has 
developed  and  achieved  Initial  Operational  Capability  of  the  Aftermarket  Support 
Organization and is on schedule to fully support NSC 1 upon delivery. 

All  other  Deepwater  Assets  are  supported  under  existing  contracts.  As  assets 
come  into  their  Logistics  support  phase  (post  DD250,  the  ‘‘Material  Inspection  and 
Receiving  Report’’),  contracts  are  being  let  to  cover  ICGS  support.  Some  contracts 
are being negotiated now to bring in this support. Aviation logistics support for the 
first three MPAs is an example of support to be awarded. ICGS has been supporting 
over 50+ operational CG assets for the last 12 months. 

ICGS  has  provided  all  contractual  deliverables  to  date,  in  accordance  with  the 
program  of  record  Integrated  Master  Schedule  (IMS).  Specific  examples  include  In-
tegrated Support Plans, Training Plans and curriculum, Technical Manuals for oper-
ations  and  maintenance,  initial  maintenance  tasks,  spares,  and  sourcing  rec-
ommendations,  etc.  For  the  NSC,  ICGS  established  an  approved  Best  Value  Anal-
ysis  process  that  has  processed  60  percent  of  C4ISR  and  HM&E  sub-systems 
sustainment  solutions.  Logistics  process  documents,  deliverables,  and  services  have 
been  carried  out  according  to  approved  plans.  Contracts  that  have  been  completed 
were done with full disclosure to the government via certificates of conformance and 
DD250s  where  required.  Logistics  support  is  aligned  and  in  concert  with  the  con-
tracts delivery schedules. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

DR. LEO S. MACKAY 

Question  1.  Dr.  Mackay,  Lockheed  Martin  is  quoted  in  a  letter  dated  August  29, 
2006,  to  Integrated  Coast  Guard  Systems  saying  that  testing  each  of  the  compo-
nents of the C4ISR system installed aboard the 123-foot cutters would be ‘‘time con-
suming,  expensive,  and  of  limited  value,’’  and  that  waivers  should  be  sought.  What 
did Lockheed mean by ‘‘of limited value?’’ 

Answer.  Off-the-shelf,  ruggedized  maritime  systems  were  selected  for  the  C4ISR 
system in accordance with the Coast Guard Cutter Certification Matrix (CCM). The 
CCM  did  not  require  equipment  designed  and  tested  to  full  U.S.  Navy  military 
standards and performance specifications (MIL–STDs and MIL–SPECs). We have a 
long  and  wide-ranging  experience  in  delivering  and  maintaining  high  performance 
combat systems to the U.S. Navy and allied navies. As such, we believe that exten-
sive  testing  of  off-the-shelf,  ruggedized  maritime  equipment  to  determine  the  level 
of compliance to U.S. Navy military standards and performance specifications would 
not provide any significant operational benefits to the Coast Guard and would have 
defeated the benefits of off-the-shelf, ruggedized maritime systems.

Question 2. As I asked Mr. Teel, do you believe the contract is working? 
Answer.  We  believe  the  contract  is  working.  We  are  making  good  progress  and 
are delivering significant new and upgraded capabilities. At the same time, we rec-
ognize  the  system  level  effects  of  networking  are  essential  to  achieving  the  level  of 
mission performance needed by the Coast Guard. Lockheed Martin is accomplishing 
high  rates  of  software  reuse  as  well  as  system  commonality  and  integration  by  the 
rigorous  application  of  proven  system  engineering  processes  and  capabilities.  This 
is saving significant amounts of time and money. In addition, we are managing im-
plementation of support systems for all Deepwater program domains. 

Every one of the Coast Guard’s 12 high-endurance and 27 medium-endurance cut-
ters  have  received  not  one  but  two  command  and  control  system  upgrades—giving 
the  fleet  markedly  improved  capability  to  seize  drugs,  interdict  migrants  and  save 
lives. As for shore sites, there are a total of 12 on contract: two Communication Area 
Master Stations, eight Districts, one Sector and Headquarters. 

Two  medium-range  surveillance  maritime  patrol  aircraft,  the  newly  designated 
HC–144, have been transferred to the Coast Guard, missionization is underway and 
two  crews  are  already  in  training.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  working  to  complete 
re-engining and upgrading of HH–65 helicopters with 68 of 95 helicopters delivered 
to  date.  Lockheed  Martin  and  American  Eurocopter  working  with  the  Coast  Guard 
Aircraft  Repair  and  Supply  Center  are  now  producing  upgraded  helicopters  (‘‘Char-
lie’’  models)  that  can  fly  faster,  twice  as  far  and  with  twice  the  payload.  Six  long- 
range surveillance C–130J aircraft are undergoing missionization and will be deliv-
ered with fully interoperable command, control and communications systems. In ad-
dition,  the  service  contract  for  the  Helicopter  Interdiction  Tactical  Squadron  based 
in  Jacksonville,  FL,  has  been  renewed  for  a  fifth  year.  These  eight  MH–68A  heli-
copters  are  capable  of  Airborne  Use  of  Force  and  have  had  a  significant  impact  on 
illicit drug interdictions. 

Question  3.  Are  there  aspects  that  you  believe  should  be  changed  to  ensure  that 
the Coast Guard receives state-of-the-art assets that meet the performance require-
ments of the Coast Guard, at a reasonable cost? 

Answer.  The  terms  of  the  overarching  Deepwater  contract  were  collaboratively 
modified  between  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  industry  teams  (Lockheed  Martin  and 
Northrop  Grumman)  in  the  months  leading  up  to  the  release  of  the  Award  Term 
RFP. The changes to which we have fundamentally agreed will greatly simplify the 
negotiating  process  and  will  significantly  strengthen  the  Government’s  ability  to 
manage  the  Deepwater  contract,  particularly  taking  into  consideration  the  Coast 
Guard’s recently announced organizational restructuring. 

The  Deepwater  contract  changes  now  in  negotiation  are  aimed  at  clarifying  the 
contract terms, to our mutual benefit, so that both the Coast Guard and the indus-
try  team  have  a  clearer  alignment  of  expectations  and  commitments,  and  stream-
lines  some  aspects  of  contract  deliverables  and  measurement  to  enable  the  Coast 
Guard  to  better  manage  the  contract  and  the  industry  team  to  more  clearly  meet 
and  exceed  expectations.  Elements  that  will  be 
include  contract 
deliverables,  performance  criteria  and  incentives,  cost  control  criteria  and  competi-
tion, among others. The contract also includes specific reference to relevant Federal 
contracting regulations. 

impacted 

Question  4.  I  understand  the  ICGS  uses  a  Lockheed  Martin  concept  for  competi-
tion,  called  the  ‘‘Open  Business  Model.’’  The  GAO  has  described  this  as  only  a  phi-
losophy, and not a requirement for actually competing subcontracts. Can you please 
explain exactly what this ‘‘Open Business Model’’ is, and how it differs from the typ-
ical requirement for formal competition of subcontracts? 

Answer. The Open Business Model is part of the Lockheed Martin subcontracting 
process  that  helps  ensure  best  value  throughout  the  program.  It  involves  deferring 
down-select  decisions  as  long  as  practicable  to  avoid  guaranteed  work  share  to  a 
particular supplier. This helps facilitate thorough evaluations of the marketplace for 
the most appropriate products and services. Deepwater competition requirements on 
the  program  are  governed  by  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  52.244–5,  ‘‘Com-
petition in Subcontracting.’’ 

Question  5.  Do  you  have  an  explanation  for  the  difficulty  experienced  by  the  De-
partment  of  Homeland  Security’s  Inspector  General’s  office  in  gaining  access  to  the 
ICGS personnel, information, and documentation during the course of their audit on 
the National Security Cutter? 

Answer. The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General’s office has ac-
cess to personnel, information, and documentation that may be required during the 
course  of  audits.  We  have  requested  that  the  Inspector  General’s  personnel  respect 
the rights of industry employees during any interviews.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

DR. LEO S. MACKAY 

Question.  In  your  written  statement,  you  mention  the  importance  of  maintaining 
emphasis  on  C4ISR  (Command  and  Control,  Computers,  Communications,  Intel-
ligence,  Surveillance,  and  Reconnaissance).  Further,  you  state  Lockheed  Martin  is 
working  closely  with  ICGS  to  ensure  that  electronic  equipment  developed  and  pro-
duced under the cognizance of the C4ISR domain is appropriately configured for in-
stallation  on  the  ship.  Yet  the  DHS  reports  that  the  safety  of  the  123′  patrol  boat 
crews was compromised by the contractor’s failure to utilize low smoke cabling and 
that the contractor knowingly installed C4ISR equipment aboard the 123′ cutter and 
prosecutor  that  did  not  meet  specific  environmental  requirements  outlined  in  the 
Deepwater  contract.  With  the  emphasis  on  appropriately  configured  C4ISR  equip-
ment,  why  did  the  contractor  fail  to  use  low  smoke  cabling  and  knowingly  install 
C4ISR equipment that did not meet environmental requirements? 
Answer.  Please  note  that  the  DHS  OIG  Report—OIG–07–27  titled  ‘‘110′/123′ 
Maritime Patrol Boat Modernization Project’’ did not conclude the safety of the 123′ 
patrol  boat  crews  was  compromised  by  the  contractor’s  failure  to  utilize  low  smoke 
cabling.  This  was  a  complainant’s  allegation  to  the  OIG’s  Complaint  Hotline.  The 
results  of  the  subsequent  OIG  review  did  not  uphold  this  allegation.  Although  not 
all cables were low smoke cables, safety was not compromised. The Coast Guard has 
determined that no further action is required for the low smoke cabling. 

The  IG  did  determine  that  aspects  of  the  C4ISR  equipment  installed  aboard  the 
123-foot  cutters  do  not  meet  the  design  standards  set  forth  in  the  Deepwater  con-
tract. This allegation was upheld and the Coast Guard was and is actively involved 
in  assessing  compliance  of  marine,  ruggedized  off-the-shelf  C4ISR  equipment  with 
military  specifications.  The  Coast  Guard  expressed  a  requirement  for  off-the-shelf 
equipment  and  at  the  same  time  imposed  military  standards  in  the  contract.  The 
IG’s  resulting  recommendations  included  the  need  for  the  Coast  Guard  to  develop 
and  implement  a  plan  to  improve  the  process  for  reviewing  and  adjudicating  con-
tractor Requests for Deviations/Waivers (RFD/RFW). The RFD/RFW process permits 
the  customer  to  make  an  informed  decision  regarding  cost-effectiveness  and  safety 
considerations.  It  is  not  a  step  of  convenience  for  the  contractor.  It  is  a  responsible 
way  to  allow  the  customer  to  make  important  tradeoffs  subject  to  its  own  criteria 
and  requirements.  The  IG  further  concluded  that  the  plan  should  ensure  that  all 
waiver  requests  are  resolved  prior  to  implementation  and  that  the  rationale  under-
lying these decisions is formally documented. It is our understanding that the Coast 
Guard is in the process of implementing appropriate contractual and program man-
agement oversight process improvements. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

DR. LEO S. MACKAY 

Question.  Do  you  attribute  the  improvements  in  the  Coast  Guard’s  statistics  on 
search  and  rescue,  alien  interdiction  and  drug  interdiction  to  the  Deepwater  pro-
gram? 

Answer. Yes, we are making good progress and are delivering significant new and 
upgraded  capabilities.  At  the  same  time,  we  recognize  the  system  level  effects  of 
networking  are  essential  to  achieving  the  level  of  mission  performance  needed  by 
the Coast Guard. Lockheed Martin is accomplishing high rates of software reuse as 
well  as  system  commonality  and  integration  by  the  rigorous  application  of  proven 
system  engineering  processes  and  capabilities.  Every  one  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  12 
high-endurance  and  27  medium-endurance  cutters  have  received  not  one  but  two 
command  and  control  system  upgrades—giving  the  fleet  markedly  improved  capa-
bility to seize drugs, interdict migrants and save lives. 

Use  and  reuse  of  commercial-off-the-shelf,  government-off-the-shelf  and  fielded 
maritime  systems  are  being  maximized  for  commonality  and  interoperability.  The 
application  of  off-the-shelf  software  permits  Deepwater  to  take  advantage  of  the 
rapid  changes  in  the  commercial  marketplace  and  the  investments  which  commer-
cial  firms  make  in  their  best  of  class  technologies.  This  will  facilitate  Coast  Guard 
interoperability with civil and international systems, a key consideration given their 
mission mix.

The results so far indicate that Deepwater has made a significant contribution to 
the  effectiveness  of  the  Coast  Guard  with  regard  to  the  numbers  of  drug  seizures, 
migrant  interdictions  and  lives  saved.  Coast  Guard  statistics  show  double-  and  tri-
ple-digit  percent  improvements  as  Deepwater  assets  and  upgrades  enter  the  fleet.
