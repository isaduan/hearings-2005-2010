THE  DEPARTMENT  OF  COMMERCE 

SECRETARY 

JOHN 

AND 

WEDNESDAY,  MAY  18,  2005

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:10  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Trent Lott presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT,

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Senator LOTT. The hearing will now come to order. Today’s hear-
ing  will  be  short,  so  I  will  forego  a  lengthy  statement  so  that  the 
nominees can answer any questions that may need to be addressed 
to  them  by  the  Committee  Members.  I  urge  other  Senators  that 
may be here just to submit their statements for the record. 

Although, Senator Rockefeller, if you would like to speak at great 

length, certainly you would be recognized to do so. 

On  April  4,  2005,  the  President  nominated  Dr.  David  Sampson 
to be Deputy Secretary of Commerce. Dr. Sampson currently serves 
as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development. We 
welcome Dr. Sampson and his family. 

Are they here? 
Dr. SAMPSON. Yes, sir. 
Senator LOTT. Let us recognize this good-looking family out here. 

How many have we got lined up there? 

Dr. SAMPSON. My wife and twin sons, John and Matt. 
Senator  LOTT.  All  right.  Oh,  double  trouble,  no  question  about 

that. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LOTT.  But  thank  you,  Mrs.  Sampson,  for  sacrificing  to 
allow  your  husband  to  serve  his  country  in  this  way.  But  I  hope 
you find some enjoyment in it too. 

Today’s witnesses may have learned a little bit about the impor-
tance  of  fish  to  Members  of  this  Committee.  I  did  have  a  large 
chart with a smiling fish so you would think National Marine Fish-
eries  Service  every  morning,  Dr.  Sampson.  But  I  decided  that  you 
had been briefed in advance to the importance of fisheries. 

Both witnesses’ full statements will be made a part of the record. 

Dr. Sampson, again, we congratulate you.

And  also,  Mr.  Sullivan,  you  currently  serve  as  Deputy  General 
Counsel  of  the  Defense  Department.  And  you  clerked  for  Justice 
Souter.  And  we  welcome  you  and  your  family  here  this  morning. 
Are they here? Could we recognize them? 

Mr.  SULLIVAN.  Thank  you,  Senator.  Yes.  I  have  my  mother-in-
law  with  me,  Grace  Rodriguez,  and  my  two  boys,  Jack  and  Teddy 
Sullivan. 

Senator LOTT. Well, they look very sharp in those fancy ties and 

coats. 

Congratulations  to  both  of  you.  This  is  a  credit  to  you  to  be  rec-
ognized,  to  be  nominated  for  these  very  important  positions.  Mr. 
Sullivan,  both  you  and  Dr.  Sampson,  you  are  going  to  have  very 
critical  positions  at  the  Department  of  Commerce.  Of  course,  this 
Committee will be following your activities very closely. 

May I yield to Senator Rockefeller for any opening comments you 

would like to make? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV,

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Well,  I  will  be  brief,  Mr.  Chairman,  as  I 
always  am.  I  did  not  have  a  chance  to  talk  to  Mr.  Sullivan,  but  I 
had a wonderful conversation with Dr. Sampson. And we discussed 
the  importance  of  manufacturing,  the  importance  of  jobs,  the  im-
portance  of  what  do  you  do  when  people  48  years  old,  you  know—
and  nobody  has  really  good  answers.  But  it  was  a  sensitization—
is that the right word? Sensitivity training. 

And the Department of Commerce is huge for West Virginia. We 
actually  discovered  yesterday  that  we  have  the  seventh  largest  in-
land port in America. 

Senator LOTT. Where is that? 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Huntington, it is very big. 
International  trade,  we  discussed,  and  the  importance  of  having 
fair  trade,  as  well  as  free  trade.  Sometimes  it  is  easy  to  say  both, 
but  hard  to  differentiate  when  it  comes  to  the  practice  of  it.  We 
work very, very closely with you. I expressed to you the importance 
of just you, as an individual, to this country and to my state. 

Trent  Lott  and  I  share  a  lot  of  the  same  kinds  of  problems  and 
urgencies.  And  so  I  discussed  these  things  with  you.  And  we  had 
a very, very good conversation, I thought. 

Mr. Sullivan, your task, obviously, is tremendously important. 
You are a lawyer, are you not, Trent? 
Senator LOTT. Used to be. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. And I am not. But that is a large respon-
sibility  on  your  part.  So  we  tend  to  try  and  work  closely  with  you 
all.  And  we  need  you.  And  you  need  us,  to  a  certain  extent.  And 
it  should  produce  a  productive  relationship.  I  am  very  glad  that 
you are both here, as well as your families. 

Dr. SAMPSON. Thank you, Senator. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator  LOTT.  We  are  honored  to  have  with  us  this  morning  to 
speak  on  behalf  of  Dr.  Sampson,  I  believe,  Senator  Kay  Bailey 
Hutchison, who is a very valued Member of this Committee. 

Senator  Hutchison,  we  would  be  glad  to  open  with  your  state-
ment  and,  after  that,  have  you  join  us,  if  you  can,  at  the  podium.

STATEMENT OF HON. KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS 

Senator  HUTCHISON.  Well,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  very 
pleased to be here to introduce my long-time friend. I have worked 
with him for a long time in Texas. And now he is going to be nomi-
nated  for  the  position  of  Deputy  Secretary  of  Commerce.  He  is  an 
assistant secretary now and has done a terrific job as the principal 
advisor on policy development to the Secretary. He has established 
funding  priorities  to  find  grant  investment  policy  guidelines.  And 
in  his  role  as  directing  operations  of  the  Economic  Development 
Administration,  he  initiated  a  reorganization  of  that  part  of  the 
Commerce Department for the first time in the 37 years of the De-
partment of Commerce history. 

Also,  in  addition  to  his  professional  background,  he  has  a  won-
derful  track  record  of  vision  and  character  and  commitment  to 
whatever  job  he  holds.  Before  he  assumed  his  present  job  at  the 
Department  of  Commerce,  he  was  involved  in  economic  develop-
ment  activities  at  the  state  level  in  Texas.  He  was  appointed  by 
then  Governor  Bush  to  serve  as  Vice  Chairman  of  the  Texas  Stra-
tegic  Economic  Development  Planning  Commission  and  then  later 
chaired the Texas Council on Workforce and Economic Competitive-
ness. 

So  I  think  he  has  had  deep  experience  in  exactly  what  we  want 
the  Commerce  Department  to  do.  And  that  is  find  ways  to  create 
a better economic climate in our country and create more jobs and 
keep  our  industry  in  America  and  make  sure  that  we  have  a 
healthy business climate in our country. 

Dr. Sampson was the president and CEO of the Arlington Cham-
ber  of  Commerce  before  he  came  into  government.  He  led  an  ag-
gressive  business  development  and  retention  program  there  and 
was  known  as  an  effective  leader  throughout  our  state.  He  is  a 
graduate of David Lipscomb University and earned his doctorate at 
Abilene Christian University. He currently resides in Northern Vir-
ginia,  but  I  think  his  heart  is  still  in  Texas.  And  it  is  my  honor 
to  introduce  him,  someone  that  I  know  will  do  a  great  job  for  our 
country at this very important time in our economic period. 

Senator  LOTT.  Well,  thank  you,  honored  colleague.  We  are  very 
proud  of  the  work  you  do.  We  know  that  you  have  pride  in  this 
nominee.  I  mean,  it  sounds  like  he  has  an  excellent  background 
and  credentials.  I  am  really  pleased  to  learn  of  his  experience  in 
economic  development  and  his  knowledge  of  a  variety  of  issues  at 
the  Commerce  Department.  When  you  look  at  the  Commerce  De-
partment,  it  has  a  huge  jurisdictional  responsibility,  all  the  way 
from trade to fisheries and other economic development. It is a very 
important  department.  And  we  have  to  have  good,  strong  leader-
ship there. 

So, Dr. Sampson, we will be glad to hear from you at this point. 
STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID A. SAMPSON, NOMINEE TO BE

DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Dr. SAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am honored to appear 
before you as the President’s nominee to be Deputy Secretary of the 
U.S.  Department  of  Commerce.  And  I  am  deeply  grateful  to  the 
President for the opportunity to serve and his confidence. And I ap-

preciate Secretary Gutierrez’s confidence and support, as well. And 
I also want to thank the Members of this Committee for their cour-
tesies in visiting with me over the past couple of months. 

Today  I  would  like  to  be  able  to  give  you  a  better  sense  of  what 
I  hope  to  accomplish  as  Deputy  Secretary  of  Commerce,  if  given 
that opportunity. And let me begin by stating my very strong com-
mitment to the core mission of the Department of Commerce. 

At  the  Department,  we  serve  the  American  people  by  helping  to 
create  the  right  conditions  for  economic  growth  and  expanding  op-
portunity. We promote innovation. We foster entrepreneurship. We 
enhance  competitiveness,  and  we  encourage  environmental  stew-
ardship. The Deputy Secretary of the Department of Commerce ef-
fectively  serves  as  the  agency’s  chief  operating  officer,  overseeing 
the  Department’s  38,000  employees  and  $6.5  billion  budget.  And  I 
also  understand  the  Deputy  Secretary  acts  as  the  Secretary’s  pri-
mary advisor and surrogate. 

As you have mentioned, the Department addresses a wide range 
of  very  important  challenges  to  our  Nation’s  economy  every  day 
from  marine  fisheries  to  international  trade,  the  census,  and  var-
ious  other  scientific,  environmental,  technological,  and  economic 
areas. 

With  the  support  of  the  Committee  and  the  hardworking  men 
and women of the Department, I am confident that I can maintain 
the  high  standards  set  by  my  predecessors  and  support  Secretary 
Gutierrez’s  commitment  to  excellence.  If  confirmed  by  the  Senate, 
I will try to bring my valuable experience to the Office of the Dep-
uty  Secretary.  I  am  very  proud  of  the  track  record  that  EDA  has 
accomplished  over  the  past  4  years  and  I  am  very  appreciative  of 
both  the  career  and  political  staff  that  I  have  had  the  honor  to 
work with. 

During my tenure, I have learned a lot about the Department of 
Commerce  in  interacting  with  other  bureaus.  But  I  clearly  recog-
nize  that  there  is  a  lot  still  to  learn.  I  welcome  that  challenge.  I, 
if  confirmed,  will  support  the  Secretary  as  he  directs  the  Depart-
ment’s focus on economic growth and job creation. We will open for-
eign markets. We will insist that our trading partners comply with 
the  full  terms  of  their  agreements  with  us.  We  will  foster  techno-
logical innovation. We will defend intellectual property rights. And 
we  will  implement  effective  export  controls.  We  will  promote  the 
wise  stewardship  of  our  natural  resources  and  oversee  the  collec-
tion of sound economic statistics to inform good policy. 

And if confirmed, I look forward to working with this Committee 

on these and other matters. 

In closing, I have been literally blessed with family, friends, and 
opportunity.  And  I  am  equally  grateful  especially  for  my  wife 
Karen and my sons Matt and John for their support. 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  again  for  this  opportunity  to  appear 
before the Committee and for your consideration of my nomination. 
And I would be pleased to respond to any questions the Committee 
may have. 

[The prepared statement of Dr. Sampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID A. SAMPSON, NOMINEE TO BE DEPUTY 

SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Mr. Chairman, Senator Inouye, and Members of the Committee, 
I  am  honored  to  appear  before  you  as  the  President’s  nominee  to  become  Deputy 
Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. I am grateful to President Bush for 
the  opportunity  to  serve.  And  I  deeply  appreciate  Secretary  Gutierrez’s  confidence 
and support. Let me also thank the Members of this Committee. 

Today,  I  would  like  to  give  you  a  better  sense  of  what  I  hope  to  accomplish  as 
Deputy  Secretary  of  Commerce,  if  given  that  opportunity.  Let  me  begin  by  stating 
my strong commitment to the core mission of the Department of Commerce. At the 
Department, we serve the American people by helping to create the right conditions 
for  economic  growth  and  expanded  opportunity.  We  promote  innovation.  We  foster 
entrepreneurship.  We  enhance  competitiveness.  And  we  encourage  environmental 
stewardship. 

The  Deputy  Secretary  of  the  Department  of  Commerce  effectively  serves  as  the 
Agency’s  chief  operating  officer,  overseeing  the  Department’s  38,000  employees  and 
$6.5 billion budget. The Deputy Secretary also acts as the Secretary’s primary advi-
sor and surrogate. The Department addresses a wide range of important challenges 
every  day:  From  marine  fisheries  to  international  trade,  the  Census,  and  various 
other scientific, environmental, technological, and economic areas, the Department’s 
work takes place on a global basis. 

With the support of the Committee, and the hardworking men and women of the 
Department, I am confident that I can maintain the high standards set by my pred-
ecessors and support Secretary Gutierrez’s commitment to excellence. 

If  confirmed  by  the  Senate,  I  would  bring  valuable  experience  and  knowledge  to 
the office of Deputy Secretary. For the past four years, I have served as the Assist-
ant Secretary for Economic Development. 

Our primary focus has been achieving results for people-in-need through leading-
edge, market-based economic development strategies in partnership with distressed 
regions  and  communities.  At  the  same  time,  we  have  also  focused  on  embedding 
good management practices at EDA. 

I am proud that EDA was one of the first federal programs to adopt a fully func-
tioning  Balanced  Scorecard  system.  This  system  has  helped  EDA  to  execute  our 
strategy  to  raise  performance  throughout  the  organization.  And  it  has  helped  us  to 
deliver stronger results for the American people. 

The  Balanced  Scorecard  played  a  large  role  in  driving  EDA’s  success  when  the 
President’s Office of Management and Budget evaluated our performance with their 
Program  Assessment  Rating  Tool  (PART).  Overall,  EDA  scored  in  the  top  tiers  of 
federal programs. 

Also, as you know, the Congress reauthorized EDA in 2004. During the past sev-
eral  years,  EDA’s  job  creation  efforts  have  been  greatly  strengthened  by  a  pattern 
of increased private sector leverage of federal grant dollars. We understand that an 
economic development project does not begin to approach its potential until the pri-
vate sector joins the enterprise through investment and involvement. 

During  my  tenure  at  EDA,  one  of  the  President’s  early  statements  has  been  a 
guiding  objective.  He  said  ‘‘every  American  who  is  looking  for  work  should  be  able 
to  find  a  job.’’  That  mission  has  been  my  focus  since  the  day  I  was  confirmed  as 
Assistant Secretary. The Committee can be confident that it will remain my primary 
goal as Deputy Secretary. 

Several  of  the  positions  I  held  prior  to  joining  the  Department  had  a  particular 

bearing on my preparation to serve effectively as Deputy Secretary. 

Most  recently,  I  served  as  President  &  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Arlington, 
Texas  Chamber  of  Commerce.  Concurrently,  I  served  within  then-Governor  Bush’s 
Administration  by  leading  the  Texas  Council  on  Workforce  and  Economic  Competi-
tiveness  as  Chairman  and  serving  as  Vice  Chair  of  the  Texas  Strategic  Economic 
Development Planning Commission. 

My  experience  in  the  public  and  private  sectors  has  taught  me  that  the  Federal 
Government  can  play  an  important  role  in  economic  development  and  the  creation 
of  jobs  by  fostering  the  conditions  that  allow  the  private  sector  to  thrive  and  in-
crease employment. 

While  I  am  now  familiar  with  the  full  Department’s  operations  and  programs,  I 
know  that  the  job  of  staying  well-informed  never  ends.  I  welcome  that  challenge, 
And  I  will  dedicate  myself  to  meeting  the  high  expectations  for  our  Department 
from the President, the Secretary, and this Committee. 

If confirmed, I will support the Secretary as he directs the Department’s focus on 
economic growth and job creation. We will open foreign markets. We will insist that 
our  trading  partners  comply  with  the  full  terms  of  our  trade  agreements.  We  will

foster  technological  innovation.  We  will  defend  intellectual  property  rights.  We  will 
implement  effective  export  controls.  We  will  promote  the  wise  stewardship  of  our 
natural  resources.  And  we  will  oversee  the  collection  of  sound  economic  statistics. 
If confirmed, I look forward to working with this Committee on these and other mat-
ters. 

In  closing,  I  have  been  richly  blessed  with  family,  friends,  and  opportunity.  I  am 

deeply grateful, especially for my wife Karen and my twin sons, Matt and John. 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  again  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today, 
and  for  your  consideration  of  my  nomination.  I  would  be  pleased  to  respond  to  any 
questions you may have.

16.  Please  identify  each  instance  in  which  you  have  testified  orally  or  in  writing 
before  Congress  in  a  non-governmental  capacity  and  specify  the  subject  matter  of 
each testimony: None. 

B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

1.  Describe  all  financial  arrangements,  deferred  compensation  agreements,  and 

other continuing dealings with business associates, clients, or customers: None. 

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment,  affiliation,  or  practice  with  any  business,  association,  or  other  organi-
zation during your appointment? No. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated: None. 

4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have had during the last 5 years, whether for yourself, on behalf of a client, or act-
ing  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict  of 
interest in the position to which you have been nominated: None. 

5. Describe any activity during the past 5 years in which you have been engaged 
for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modifica-
tion of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public 
policy. 

None  prior  to  commencing  my  service  with  this  Administration.  During  my  Fed-
eral Government service I have helped draft or edit letters to Members of Congress 
and  Senators,  appeared  before  Congressional  Committees,  and  met  with  Members 
of  Congress,  Senators,  and  Congressional  staff  regarding  the  Administration  posi-
tion on various issues, including legislation. 

I served as the Administration’s point person on behalf of the ‘‘Economic Develop-
ment Administration Reauthorization Act of 2004.’’ In that capacity, I met with indi-
vidual  Members  of  Congress  and  their  staff  to  discuss  the  bill  and  testified  before 
Congressional Committees. 

In  February  2005,  President  Bush  proposed  the  ‘‘Strengthening  America’s  Com-
munities Initiative’’ in his FY06 Budget Submission. As Assistant Secretary of Com-
merce  for  Economic  Development,  I  have  met  with  Members  of  Congress  and  their 
staff  to  explain  the  proposal  and  testified  before  the  House  Subcommittee  on  Fed-
eralism and the Census, as well as the House Transportation Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Development and Public Buildings. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. 

I will consult with ethics officials of the Department of Commerce and take what-
ever  action  is  deemed  necessary  and  appropriate  to  resolve  or  avoid  any  potential 
conflict of interest. 

C. LEGAL MATTERS 

1.  Have  you  ever  been  disciplined  or  cited  for  a  breach  of  ethics  by,  or  been  the 
subject  to  any  court,  administrative  agency,  professional  association,  disciplinary 
committee, or other professional group? No. 

2.  Have  you  ever  been  investigated,  arrested,  charged,  or  held  by  an  Federal, 
State,  or  other  law  enforcement  authority  of  any  Federal,  State,  county,  or  munic-
ipal entity, other than for a minor traffic offense? 

In June 2003, the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General (OIG) re-
ceived an anonymous complaint alleging that I had violated conflict of interest rules 
relative to the award of an EDA grant to the University of Texas at Arlington Tech-
nology Incubator. The OIG, after a thorough investigation, found that the allegation 
had  no  merit,  and  in  fact,  found  unequivocally,  that  I  took  no  action  to  affect  the 
award  of  the  grant,  and  there  was  no  violation  of  law  or  regulation  by  the  agency. 
3.  Have  you  or  any  business  of  which  you  are  or  were  an  officer  ever  been  in-

volved as a party in an administrative agency proceeding or civil litigation? No. 

4.  Have  you  ever  been  convicted  (including  pleas  of  guilty  or  nolo  contendere  of 

any criminal violation other than a minor traffic offense? No. 

5.  Please  advise  the  Committee  of  any  additional  information,  favorable  or  unfa-

vorable, which you feel should be disclosed in connection with your nomination.

Over  the  past  4  years,  I  have  led  the  Economic  Development  Administration 
through  significant  change,  including  a  reorganization,  the  introduction  of  invest-
ment  policy  guidelines  and  funding  priorities  for  its  activities,  the  implementation 
of  a  balanced  scorecard,  and  application  of  rigorous  performance  management  of 
personnel. While this resulted in a dramatic improvement of EDA’s overall perform-
ance  (as  evidenced  in  OMB’s  PART  analysis  rating  EDA  as  the  highest  performer 
among Federal Government’s 18 community and economic development direct grant 
programs), it also resulted in a 20 percent reduction of headquarters staff. It is pos-
sible that some internal and external groups that opposed these management initia-
tives may take issue with my nomination. 

6.  Have  you  ever  been  accused,  formally  or  informally,  of  sexual  harassment  or 
discrimination  on  the  basis  of  sex,  race,  religion,  or  any  other  basis?  If  so,  please 
explain. 

As the head of a bureau at the Department of Commerce, I am ultimately respon-
sible for all personnel decisions taken by all supervisors in the bureau. It is my un-
derstanding  that  during  my  four  years  at  the  Department,  only  one  employee  initi-
ated a discrimination case against the Department through the administrative proc-
ess open to all federal employees. Four other cases existed at the time I became As-
sistant  Secretary.  These  were  settled  or  dismissed,  and  one  is  pending  decision. 
There have been no findings of discrimination. 

D. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMITTEE 

1. Will you ensure that your department/agency complies with deadlines for infor-

mation set by congressional committees? 

If  confirmed  by  the  Senate,  I  will  make  it  a  high  priority  to  ensure  the  depart-

ment complies with deadlines set by congressional committees. 

2.  Will  you  ensure  that  your  department/agency  does  whatever  it  can  to  protect 
congressional  witnesses  and  whistle  blowers  from  reprisal  for  their  testimony  and 
disclosures? 

If confirmed by the Senate, I will make it a priority to ensure that the department 

protects congressional witnesses and whistle blowers from reprisal. 

3.  Will  you  cooperate  in  providing  the  Committee  with  requested  witnesses,  in-
cluding technical experts and career employees, with firsthand knowledge of matters 
of interest to the Committee? 

If confirmed by the Senate, I will make it a priority to ensure the Committee has 
access to witnesses and subject matter experts to assist in your oversight and policy 
development responsibilities. 

4.  Are  you  willing  to  appear  and  testify  before  any  duly  constituted  committee  of 

the Congress on such occasions as you may be reasonably requested to do so? 

If confirmed by the Senate, it will be a personal priority to make myself available 

to appear and provide testimony before Congressional Committees.

Senator LOTT. Thank you, Dr. Sampson. 
Let us go ahead with John Sullivan and his testimony on behalf 
of his nomination to be General Counsel of the Department of Com-
merce.  I  read  your  resume.  It  is  very  interesting.  You  certainly 
have plenty of legal experience and good experience working as the 
Deputy General Counsel at the Department of Defense. 

I also noted that you served as a law clerk to Judge John Minor 

Wisdom of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals——

Mr. SULLIVAN. That is correct, Senator. 
Senator  LOTT.  in  New  Orleans,  Louisiana.  Whether  you  agree 
with his decisions or not, he certainly has a well-earned reputation 
for  having  some  of  the  brightest  and  subsequently  most  successful 
law  clerks  of  just  about  any  appellate  court  judge  in  this  country. 
So just the fact that you clerked with him probably boosts your cre-
dentials even more. 

Mr.  SULLIVAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator.  It  was  a  great 

honor to——

Senator  LOTT.  Well,  having  said  that,  we  would  be  glad  to  hear 

your statement this morning.

STATEMENT OF JOHN J. SULLIVAN, NOMINEE TO BE GENERAL 

COUNSEL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 

15

Mr.  SULLIVAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee. I am honored to appear before you today as the President’s 
nominee  to  serve  as  the  General  Counsel  of  the  U.S.  Department 
of  Commerce.  I  am  grateful  and  honored  that  President  Bush  has 
given  me  this  opportunity.  And  I  am  deeply  gratified  by  the  con-
fidence and support shown to me by Secretary Gutierrez. 

I  would  also  like  to  thank  this  Committee  and  its  staff  for  the 
courtesies  they  have  extended  to  me  in  this  confirmation  process. 
The  General  Counsel  of  the  Department  of  Commerce  is  the 
agency’s  chief  legal  officer,  providing  advice  to  the  Secretary  and 
senior officials as they perform their vital work. The breadth of the 
Department’s  responsibilities  and  activities  are  reflected  in  the 
complex  legal  environment  in  which  it  operates.  Competently  han-
dling  the  complex  legislative  and  regulatory  issues  faced  daily  in 
the Department, from the regulation of international trade to man-
agement of marine fisheries and a multitude of other functions, all 
those issues will present a formidable challenge, but one that I wel-
come. 

If confirmed by the Senate, I believe I will bring substantial rel-
evant experience to the position of General Counsel. In 20 years of 
law  practice,  I  have  had  the  privilege  of  serving  in  a  wide  variety 
of  positions,  as  a  law  clerk  to  Judge  John  Minor  Wisdom  in  New 
Orleans  and  to  Supreme  Court  Justice  David  H.  Souter  of  New 
Hampshire  and  was  counselor  to  the  assistant  attorney  general  in 
charge  of  the  Office  of  Legal  Counsel  at  the  Justice  Department. 
I  have  been  a  partner  in  the  law  firm  of  Mayer,  Brown,  Rowe 
and  Maw  here  in  the  D.C.  office.  And  as  you  mentioned,  Senator, 
my  current  position,  I  am  the  Deputy  General  Counsel  of  the  De-
fense  Department.  In  all  of  these  roles,  in  representing  clients  in 
trial  and  appellate  proceedings,  complex  regulatory  matters,  and 
international  business  transactions,  I  believe  I  have  developed  the 
skills and experience necessary to address the legal changes facing 
the Commerce Department. 

I also know that I have much to learn about the Department, its 
programs, and the laws and regulations that govern its operations. 
As  I  look  forward  to  beginning  this  education,  I  know  that  I  will 
be  well  supported  by  the  deep  and  talented  staff  of  career  lawyers 
and  other  professionals  at  the  Department.  I  am  confident  that 
with their support I will perform my duties with the skill and pro-
fessionalism that President Bush and you expect and deserve. 

In  this  regard,  there  is  no  more  important  duty  for  the  General 
Counsel  than  to  serve  as  the  chief  ethics  lawyer  for  the  Depart-
ment.  Compliance  with  the  letter  and  spirit  of  the  ethics  laws  is 
a top priority for Secretary Gutierrez. I share a strong commitment 
to ensuring that the employees of the Department act with the ut-
most integrity and honesty. And I will strive to ensure that the De-
partment’s programs are implemented in that spirit. 

I  also  have  a  keen  appreciation  for  the  role  of  this  Committee 
and  the  other  committees  of  the  Congress  in  enacting  the  laws 
under  which  the  Department  operates  and  in  conducting  oversight 
of  the  manner  in  which  those  laws  are  executed.  I  would  welcome

the  opportunity  to  work  with  you  as  the  Department  pursues  its 
multiple missions. 

Permit me to conclude by saying that I believe that public service 
is a special privilege and responsibility. If confirmed, I will commit 
my utmost energy, integrity, and devotion to serving the President 
and  the  American  people.  Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to 
appear  before  you  today  and  for  your  consideration  of  my  nomina-
tion. 

I  would  be  pleased  to  respond  to  any  questions  you  may  have. 
Senator LOTT. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN J. SULLIVAN, NOMINEE TO BE GENERAL COUNSEL OF 

THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 

Mr.  Chairman.  Senator  Inouye,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  honored  to  ap-
pear  before  you  today  as  the  President’s  nominee  to  serve  as  the  General  Counsel 
of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce.  I  am  grateful  and  honored  that  President 
Bush  has  given  me  this  opportunity,  and  I  am  deeply  gratified  by  the  confidence

the  myriad  legislative  and  regulatory  issues  faced  daily  in  the  Department—from 
regulation of international trade to management of marine fisheries and a multitude

If confirmed by the Senate, I believe I would bring substantial relevant experience 
to the position of General Counsel. In 20 years of law practice, I have had the privi-
lege  of  serving  in  a  wide  variety  of  positions:  as  a  law  clerk  to  Judge  John  Minor 
Wisdom and to Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter; as Counselor to the Assist-
ant Attorney General in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Depart-
ment;  as  a  partner  in  the  international  law  firm  of  Mayer,  Brown,  Rowe  &  Maw; 
and  my  current  position  as  Deputy  General  Counsel  of  the  Department  of  Defense. 
In  all  of  these  roles—in  representing  clients  in  trials  and  appellate  proceedings, 
complex  regulatory  matters,  and  international  business  transactions—I  believe  I 
have  developed  the  skills  and  experience  necessary  to  address  the  legal  challenges

B. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

1.  Describe  all  financial  arrangements,  deferred  compensation  agreements,  and 

other continuing dealings with business associates, clients, or customers. 

I  continue  to  maintain  an  interest  in  a  401(k)  savings  plan  established  by  my 
former  employer  (Mayer,  Brown,  Rowe  &  Maw).  As  disclosed  in  my  attached  finan-
cial disclosure form (SF–278), my account is vested in diversified mutual funds and 
no  contributions  to  this  account  have  been  (or  will  be)  made  since  the  termination 
of my employment in February 2004. 

2.  Do  you  have  any  commitments  or  agreements,  formal  or  informal,  to  maintain 
employment, affiliation or practice with any business, association or other organiza-
tion during your appointment? No. 

3.  Indicate  any  investments,  obligations,  liabilities,  or  other  relationships  which 
could  involve  potential  conflicts  of  interest  in  the  position  to  which  you  have  been 
nominated.

If  appointed  to  the  position  of  General  Counsel,  I  will  take  actions  necessary  to 
avoid  a  conflict  of  interest  with  the  duties  of  that  position.  Specifically,  within  90 
days of appointment I will take the following actions. 

I will divest my stock holdings and the holdings of my spouse and dependent chil-

dren in the following companies:

Caremark Rx, Inc. 
Chevron-Texaco Corp. 
Citigroup Corp. 
Comcast Corp. 
Emerson Electric Co. 
General Electric Company 
International Business Machines Corp. 
Procter & Gamble.

Until  I  have  divested  these  interests,  I  will  not  participate  personally  and  sub-
stantially  in  a  particular  matter  that  will  have  a  direct  and  predictable  effect  on 
the above-referenced companies unless my participation is permitted due to a regu-
latory exemption or conflict of interest waiver. 

My  remaining  financial  interests  do  not  require  recusal  from  any  duties  as  Gen-
eral  Counsel  because  they  are  covered  by  regulatory  exemptions  to  18  U.S.C.  § 208 
or  are  otherwise  not  conflicting  financial  interests.  However,  in  the  event  I  obtain 
any  interests  that  require  my  disqualification  from  participating  in  particular  mat-
ters  as  General  Counsel,  I  will  comply  with  such  disqualification  requirements  un-

less my participation is permitted due to a regulatory exemption or conflict of inter-
est waiver. 

In  addition,  I  will  not  personally  and  substantially  participate  in  any  particular 
matter  in  which  my  wife’s  law  firm,  King  &  Spalding  LLP,  has  a  financial  interest 
unless I am permitted to participate due to a regulatory exemption or conflict of in-
terest  waiver.  Furthermore,  pursuant  to  5  CFR  § 2635.502,  I  will  not  participate  in 
any  particular  matter  involving  specific  parties  in  which  any  client  of  my  spouse  is 
or represents a party, unless I am permitted to participate under ethics regulations. 
I  will  issue  a  statement  memorializing  my  recusals  within  90  days  of  my  con-

In  the  event  my  participation  in  a  matter  from  which  I  am  disqualified  is  impor-
tant to the government, I will seek advice from an ethics official on means to resolve 
a conflict of interest.

4.  Describe  any  business  relationship,  dealing,  or  financial  transaction  which  you 
have had during the last 5 years, whether for yourself, on behalf of a client, or act-
ing  as  an  agent,  that  could  in  any  way  constitute  or  result  in  a  possible  conflict  of 
interest in the position to which you have been nominated: None. 

5. Describe any activity during the past 5 years in which you have been engaged 
for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modifica-
tion of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public 
policy. 

I  represented,  on  a  pro  bono  basis,  the  Special  Operations  Warrior  Foundation, 

which sought a federal charter from Congress. 

6.  Explain  how  you  will  resolve  any  potential  conflict  of  interest,  including  any 

that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items.

If  appointed  to  the  position  of  General  Counsel,  I  will  take  actions  necessary  to 
avoid  a  conflict  of  interest  with  the  duties  of  that  position.  Specifically,  within  90

eral  Counsel  because  they  are  covered  by  regulatory  exemptions  to  18  U.S.C.  § 208 
or  are  otherwise  not  conflicting  financial  interests.  However,  in  the  event  I  obtain 
any  interests  that  require  my  disqualification  from  participating  in  particular  mat-
ters  as  General  Counsel,  I  will  comply  with  such  disqualification  requirements  un-
less my participation is permitted due to a regulatory exemption or conflict of inter-

Senator LOTT. Thank you very much, gentlemen. 
I  am  pleased  to  recognize  that  Senator  Bill  Nelson  from  Florida 
has  recognized  us.  And  in  a  moment  I  would  recognize  him  for  a 
statement or any questions he would like to make. 

Just  one  sort  of  statement  and  then  a  question  for  you,  Dr. 
Sampson.  This  is  parochial  perhaps  in  nature,  but  it  certainly  in-
volves  a  broad  part  of  the  country.  I  am  from  Pascagoula,  Mis-
sissippi. I grew up on the banks of the Pascagoula River rowing in 
a  small  skiff  six  miles  off  the  coast  to  the  nearest  island,  Round 
Island.  I  grew  up  fishing.  I  grew  up  next  door  to  shrimpers  and 
oystermen and red snapper fishermen and hardworking, great men 
and  women,  who  worked  tough  hours  but  are  really  great  people, 
too. They were my neighbors. They were my friends. They were my 
classmates. 

And  so  for  36  years  in  my  public  career  as  a  staff  member,  as 
a  Congressman  and  a  Senator,  I  have  been  working  to  try  to  be 
sensitive  to  particularly  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  fisheries  in  general,  at 
all levels, conservation, sports, and commercial. And I must confess 
my bent toward commercial because I do think that they are farm-
ing  the  seas  and  are  an  important  part  of  our  economy.  They  pro-
vide a lot of income to the economy and a good living for the people 
that participate. 

And,  of  course,  they  are  like  farmers  of  the  land.  They  are  quite 
often  influenced  or  affected  by  the  weather  and,  you  know,  over-
fishing, which they have to control. But for years, I have been bat-
tling for fisheries in the Gulf, quite often a pretty lonely battle and 
only  with  marginal  success.  The  National  Marine  Fisheries  budget 
always shortchanges the Gulf. Between 2003 and 2005, the portion 
of the NMFS going to the Gulf of Mexico varied between 7 to 9 per-
cent,  only  7  to  9  percent,  while  the  portion  of  the  Nation’s  fish 
caught  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  averaged  17  percent  by  weight,  21 
percent  by  value.  Meanwhile,  the  percentage  of  NMFS  budget 
being  held  at  headquarters  has  risen  from  20  to  24  percent.  It 
seems to me like priorities are a little misplaced.

This  is  a  Republican  Administration.  We  are  supposed  to  be 
pushing more money out of this city of what is available into where 
the rubber meets the road or the hook hits the water. And that has 
not  been  happening.  The  other  way  has  been  what  has  been  hap-
pening. 

Now  I  have  met  many  times  with  the  Secretary  of  Commerce. 
Secretary Evans, when he left, he sent me a nice letter with a fish 
at  the  bottom,  drawn  on  the  bottom  of  this  letter.  And  I  gave  him 
a  fish  tie  as  he  left.  And  when  I  met  with  the  new  Secretary,  this 
was the point I emphasized. 

But I have also met with the NMFS administrator, Bill Hogarth, 
in March. I asked him to provide me with apportionment by region 
of the Administration’s 2006 request for NMFS, the justification for 
it,  how  they  are  going  to  adjust  this  inadequacy.  And  I  have  not 
received all of the information yet. 

Now at the very minimum, you talk about respect, Mr. Sullivan, 
for the Congress and the Committee. It seems to me that while you 
may  not  be  able  to  comply  with  our  request  for  the  region,  you 
could at least provide the information on what the situation is and 
what the situation is going to be. 

So  here  are  my  two  questions  for  you,  Dr.  Sampson.  One,  will 
you  see  to  it  I  get  this  information?  And  two,  will  you  help  us  ad-
dress this disparity in funding? 

Dr. SAMPSON. With respect to your first question, Mr. Chairman, 
being responsive to Members of Congress is a very high priority for 
me,  has  been  over  the  last  4  years.  And  I  will  ensure  that  you  re-
ceive a response very promptly to your request for information. 

With respect to your second question, I have lived all of my adult 
life in Gulf Coast states. I went to graduate school in New Orleans. 
I  have  lived  all  of  my  adult  life  in  Texas.  And  I  am  committed  to 
working with the Gulf region to ensure the funding needed to meet 
resource management needs is appropriately allocated and look for-
ward to working with you and this Committee to that end, if I have 
the chance to serve. 

Senator  LOTT.  I  will  give  you  a  map  that  shows  the  apportion-
ment  by  region.  And  I  will  be  glad  to  have  it  blown  up  for  your 
wall,  if  you  would  like.  But  for  now,  I  will  give  you  just  this  map. 
Now Senator Hutchison from Texas and Senator Bill Nelson from 
Florida  and  Senator  Rockefeller  from  the  north  side  of  the  Gulf 
would all appreciate your cooperation. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator Rockefeller. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Let me address this to both of you. During the Clinton Adminis-
tration, it was the Department of Commerce that was meant to de-
cide  what  was  going  to  happen  about  steel  policy.  Now  when  I 
bring up the word steel policy, Chairman Lott tends to die, because 
he says, ‘‘Here we go again.’’ But I am not——

Senator  LOTT.  I  have  been  with  you  on  occasion.  Do  not  forget 

that. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. I know that. And I am not doing it for the 
purpose  of  discussing  steel.  It  is  a  philosophical  point.  And  there 
was  a  very  interesting  dynamic  which  caused  a  fairly  substantial 
rift,  actually,  between  myself  and  President  Clinton  for  a  number

of years. And that is that the Department of Commerce sort of dis-
cusses  what  should  be  our  policy  with  WTO,  what  should  be  our 
policy with the trade representatives, that, too, but what should be 
our policy about making sure that we keep manufacturing, that the 
steel industry remain healthy. 

We  understand  that  Brazil  and  China  and  others  are—the  De-
partment  of  Commerce’s  policy  was  pretty  good.  The  problem  was 
that when we would have meetings of the steel caucus, it was Sec-
retary  Ruben  who  became  the  Department  of  Commerce.  And  he 
had  decided  that  this  was  a  completely  open  world  for  free  trade. 
And I understand that. One has to be a realist here. But he spoke 
for the President. And in fact, he, I think, influenced the President 
to  back  away  from  his  commitment  to  West  Virginia  to  try  and 
help our steel industry. 

And the result was our steel industries have been through bank-
ruptcies  and  all  kinds  of  situations.  And  relatively  few  people  are 
working.  And  I  care  about  that  because  now,  as  Governor,  I  lit-
erally—with Weirton Steel, which I think is the eighth largest pro-
ducer, they were about to close down because of labor-management 
strife.  And  I  went  up  with  some  people  and  spent  a  number  of 
weeks and actually turned it around, saved it. And they became an 
ESOP,  actually  the  largest  ESOP.  I  don’t  think  United  was  an 
ESOP at that point. 

But  what  was  interesting  is  the  fact  that  there  is  the  State  De-
partment, there is Treasury, there is monetary policy, there are all 
kinds of other things. The Department of Commerce economic deci-
sions,  manufacturing  decisions,  never  stand  on  their  own,  because 
in  a  sense  they  cannot,  because  they  are  just  part  of  the  picture. 
So once you say something is part of the larger picture, then that 
tends  to  marginalize  what  you  might  be  trying  to  think  of  in  the 
Department  of  Treasury  or  the  Treasury  of  the  United  States 
would  say:  Well,  no  we  cannot  do  that  because  we  have  this  and 
that  political  problem,  or  somebody  else  would  say:  Well,  we  have 
special  problems  with  China  or  Brazil,  other  things  that  we  have 
to tend to. 

And  I  am  interested  in  your  sort  of  reaction  on  the  part  of  each 
of you to that very real situation. I do not mimic the situation, but 
it was one that turned out to be very destructive to us. 

Dr. SAMPSON. Well, Senator, obviously I cannot speak about what 
happened in the previous Administration. What I would say is that 
the  President’s  2001  steel  initiative,  I  think,  was  a  very  bold  step. 
Secretary  Evans  was  a  critical  player  in  advising  the  President  on 
that approach. And I know that Secretary Gutierrez is a key mem-
ber of the President’s economic team. The President has asked him 
to  head  the  prosperity  pillar  for  the  Security  and  Prosperity  Part-
nership  between  Canada,  the  U.S.,  and  Mexico  that  is  currently 
underway. 

And  this  Administration  is  committed  to  a  very  strong  and  ro-
bust  steel,  domestic  steel,  industry.  And  that  will  be  the  goal  to-
ward which we will continue to work. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Which, before I call on Mr. Sullivan, leads 
me to the second part of that, which is that you are quite right that 
the  President  got  very  high  marks  in  West  Virginia  for  doing  the 
Section 201. But what happened thereafter, almost nobody in West

23

Virginia  really  understood,  or  across  the  country  understands 
where steel is produced. And that is that Bob Zoellick, then USTR, 
took  95  percent  of  what  the  Section  201  covered  and  exempted  it 
from Section 201. 

So  that  was  little  noticed.  The  201  was  greatly  noticed.  But  the 
effect  was  catastrophic.  And  it  is  that  pull  between  agencies  and 
pull  between  larger  and  smaller  priorities,  which  is  interesting  to 
me. 

Mr. Sullivan, do you have any point you want to——
Mr.  SULLIVAN.  Senator,  the  only  observation  I  would  make,  I 
really  am  new  to  the  Department’s  issues  and  steel  in  particular, 
but I have a lot of experience in my prior government service with 
the  interagency  process  and  how  it  works.  And  I  am  committed  to 
helping  Secretary  Gutierrez  achieve  his  goals  for  the  President. 
The  President  has  entrusted  him  with  substantial  responsibilities. 
And  I  am  aware  of  how  the  interagency  process  can  work  and 
sometimes  not  work.  And  I  am  committed  to  helping  Secretary 
Gutierrez in that process. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. OK. And did you have a——
Mr.  SAMPSON.  Senator,  other  than  to  say  my  next  door  neighbor 
owns a steel company. And so I hear about this issue not only here 
but at Little League ball games and across the fence. So I am quite 
aware  of  the  ramifications  of  our  decisions  here  in  Washington  on 
manufacturers and users of steel policy. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  I  look  forward  to  supporting  you  both. 

Thank you. 

Senator LOTT. Thank you, Senator. 
Senator Nelson? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON,

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator BILL NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I just want to ask one question of Mr. Sampson. It is a very im-
is  a  tremendously 
portant  position.  And  I  understand  he 
credentialed  person  for  this  high-level  executive  responsibility  of 
Number 2 in the Department. 

I would just like your opinion. There is legislation that has been 
filed  by  Senator  Santorum  of  Pennsylvania.  And  what  the  legisla-
tion does, it says that if there is a competitive alternative to a gov-
ernment  website,  that  the  government  cannot  compete  with  the 
competitive  alternative.  The  obvious  example  is  in  your  Depart-
ment. At the direction of President Bush upon his inauguration, he 
directed  that  all  the  agencies  of  government  would  come  out  with 
a website so that information would be freely and quickly available 
to the people of the United States. 

This particular website for the National Weather Service was es-
pecially  helpful  and  critical  when  four  hurricanes  hit  my  state 
within a 6-week period starting last hurricane season, as a matter 
of  fact.  Now  I  do  not  know  what  the  weather  is  like  in  Pennsyl-
vania,  but  I  know  getting  information  about  hurricanes  can  be  a 
matter  of  life  and  death  to  people  in  Florida,  as  was  the  case.  As 
a matter of fact, there were recorded nine billion, with a b, hits on 
the National Weather Service website during that 6-week period of 
those hurricanes. That, by the way, far exceeds the number of hits

are. 

on any government website. The most up until that point had been 
the  six  million  hits  on  the  NASA  website  when  the  Rover  landed 
on the surface of Mars. 

Now what Senator Santorum’s bill S. 786 would do would require 
the  elimination  of  the  website  because  there  is  a  company  in  his 
state,  AccuWeather,  that  offers  the  same  information.  And  so  it 
would require that the government not be in competition. 

Now that is—I have laid out the case. Tell me what your feelings 

Mr. SAMPSON. Well, Senator, first of all, weather is a very impor-
tant  part  of  our  function.  About  30  percent  of  the  economy  of  the 
United  States  is  affected  by  the  weather,  not  to  mention  the  life 
and  safety  issues  that  you  have  so  clearly  articulated.  I  am  not 
aware  that  the  Administration  has  issued  a  statement  on  the 
Santorum bill at this point. What I can tell you is that, if confirmed 
by the Senate, I will be committed to a very strong, robust national 
weather  service  complete  system  at  the  Department  of  Commerce. 
And  we  will  work  to  ensure  that  information  is  readily  available 
to the American citizens. 

I  am  aware  that  this  is  an  important  issue.  I  have  been  very 
broadly  briefed  on  this.  But  as  I  said,  I  am  not  aware  that  there 
is a statement of position on this particular bill at this time, which 
I think was just recently filed. 

Senator  NELSON.  OK.  That  is  good  enough.  And  I  hope  I  do  not 
have to come see you in the future to remind you of your statement 
today. Because I think reason and common sense will prevail. Par-
ticularly, by the way, within 2 weeks we are now entering the next 
hurricane season. 

And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  just  say  in  passing  that  I  want  to 
commend  to  you  the  service  that  NOAA  does  and  the  hurricane 
trackers.  I  have  flown  on  those  hurricane  hunters,  in  fact  was  fly-
ing  on  the  one  when  the  first  hurricane,  Charlie,  was  south  of 
Cuba,  as  they  are  dropping  the  sondes  in  predesignated  points 
along  the  route,  measuring  all  kinds  of  data.  It  comes  back  to  the 
airplane  real  time,  is  formulated  and  sent  by  satellite  to  the  Na-
tional Hurricane Center, which then computes the data which gives 
us so much of a better accuracy in predicting the path and the fero-
ciousness of a hurricane. 

And  I  would  commend  to  you  on  some  of  their  propeller-driven 
aircraft that they use for lower altitudes, they need some more. So 
having  been  there  and  seen  what  the  valuable  service  is,  I  would 
commend  that  to  you  as  you  get  into  the  deliberations  on  those 
hurricane hunters. 

Senator  LOTT.  Senator  Nelson,  you  do  know  where  the  Air 

Force’s hurricane hunters originate from, do you not? 

Senator NELSON. Well, you must be telling me Mississippi. 
Senator  LOTT.  Keesler  Air  Force  Base,  Mississippi.  We  are  very 
proud of their work. And being the beneficiaries of some hurricane 
attention,  we  share  all  of  your  concerns.  And  we  appreciate  the 
service they provide. 

Thank  you  very  much,  gentlemen.  Congratulations  to  you  for 
being  nominated.  And  best  wishes  in  the  confirmation  process  and 
in your job when you are confirmed. 

This hearing is adjourned.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO

DR. DAVID A. SAMPSON 

Question.  As  you  may  know,  Louisiana’s  crawfish  industry  has  been  battered  for 
years by imports of dumped crawfish tail meat from China. There has been an anti-
dumping duty order in place since 1997, but it has been circumvented on a massive 
scale  and  Customs  has  collected  only  about  five  percent  of  the  antidumping  duties 
owed to the United States. Some of those duties have been provided to the domestic 
crawfish  industry  under  the  Continued  Dumping  and  Subsidy  Offset  Act  (CDSOA) 
and have played a vital role in allowing the industry to rebuild and remain competi-
tive. 

In  the  past,  nearly  all  of  the  duty  collections  have  come  from  ‘‘automatic  liquida-
tion’’ of entries by shippers that do not have their own individual duty deposit rates 
and  have  not  asked  the  Department  of  Commerce  to  conduct  an  administrative  re-
view of their entries. These shippers have waived their right to review by Commerce 
and  have  thus  consented  to  the  liquidation  of  their  entries  at  the  China-wide  rate 
of  223.01  percent.  Previously,  Commerce  has  ordered  Customs  to  perform  ‘‘auto-
matic  liquidation’’  of  such  entries  shortly  after  the  deadline  for  requesting  an  ad-
ministrative review has lapsed. This year, without any notice to the domestic indus-
try,  Commerce  has  reversed  itself  and  is  refusing  to  issue  the  ‘‘automatic  liquida-
tion’’  instruction  to  Customs  with  respect  to  entries  made  during  2003–2004.  If 
Commerce  persists  in  this  course,  there  will  likely  be  virtually  no  CDSOA  funds 
available for the domestic crawfish industry this year. This will cause serious addi-
tional  damage  to  an  industry  which  has  already  become  the  poster  child  for  poor 
enforcement  of  the  antidumping  laws.  This  single  case  already  accounts  for  more 
than 80 percent of all delinquent AD/CVD duties. 

As Deputy Secretary will you make assurances that the Department of Commerce 
will  take  immediate  action  to  expedite  the  issuance  of  the  ‘‘automatic  liquidation’’ 
instructions  for  2003–2004?  I  would  also  like  for  you  to  ensure  that  the  domestic 
crawfish industry receives a full and fair opportunity for notice and comment before 
Commerce changes its prior practice on ‘‘automatic liquidation’’ in this case. 

Answer. I appreciate your and your constituents’ concerns regarding the issuance 
of  automatic  liquidation  instructions  in  the  administrative  reviews  of  the  anti-
dumping  duty  order  on  crawfish  from  China.  This  situation  has  arisen  as  a  result 
of  last  summer’s  reorganization  of  Import  Administration  and  the  fact  that  there 
was  not  a  consistent  practice  on  the  issuance  of  automatic  liquidation  instructions 
in cases involving non-market economy (NME) countries (such as China) among the 
three  enforcement  offices  that  were  responsible  for  conducting  such  cases  prior  to 
the reorganization. 

As a result of the reorganization, the NME-related casework of those three offices 
was  consolidated  into  a  single  office—the  Office  of  Non-Market  Economy  Compli-
ance.  Since  the  consolidation,  that  office  has  been  working  to  ensure  that  uniform 
policies  are  applied  across  all  proceedings  before  it.  With  respect  to  the  issuance  of 
liquidation  instructions  in  cases  involving  non-market  economy  countries,  the  pre-
vailing  practice  was  not  to  issue  automatic  liquidation  instructions  at  the  outset  of 
a  proceeding,  but  rather  to  wait  until  the  conclusion  of  the  proceeding.  As  you  and 
your  constituents  know,  a  different  practice  was  previously  followed  for  several 
years with respect to the antidumping order on crawfish. 

In  the  current  crawfish  review,  in  an  effort  to  ensure  consistency  across  pro-
ceedings, a decision was made not to issue automatic liquidation instructions at the 
outset of the review, in contrast to the action taken in earlier reviews. I regret that 
your constituents were not given an opportunity to comment on this change in prac-
tice, and I have expressed my concerns about it to senior Import Administration offi-
cials. 

Import Administration will be issuing shortly a Federal Register notice requesting 
public  comments  on  whether  its  current  practice  on  the  issuance  of  automatic  liq-
uidation  instructions  in  NME  proceedings  should  be  revised.  This  notice  will  allow

your constituents an opportunity to recommend changes to the current practice and 
offer  their  suggestions  on  how  the  practice  might  be  improved.  I  understand  that 
there  may  be  conflicting  views  among  various  domestic  industries  on  this  question, 
so  I  would  encourage  your  constituents  who  are  interested  in  this  issue  to  partici-
pate actively in this comment process. 

Finally, with respect to the duty collection issue you raised during our recent con-
versation,  U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP)  is  responsible  for  collecting 
duties from U.S. importers of crawfish tail meat from China. To the extent you have 
not already done so, you or your staff may wish to contact appropriate officials with-
in the CBP to discuss the issue further. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

DR. DAVID A. SAMPSON 

Question 1. Can you describe the progress and status of the President’s Manufac-

Of  the  57  Recommendations,  21  have  been  initiated,  some  on  an  ongoing  basis:
1.  Create  an  Assistant  Secretary  of  Commerce  for  Manufacturing  and  Services.
2. Create a new Office of Industry Analysis.
3.  Establish  a  President’s  Manufacturing  Council  to  provide  oversight  and  ad-
vice on the implementation of the Manufacturing Initiative.
4.  Coordinate  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  centers  with  other  Com-
merce programs.
5.  Promote  the  protection  of  U.S.  intellectual  property  abroad  by  expanding  co-
operative efforts with developing country trading partners.
6.  Investigate  aggressively  allegations  of  theft  of  intellectual  property  that 
would violate commitments made under TRIPS or similar provisions of bilateral 
or regional agreements.
7. Establish an Office of Investigations and Compliance within Commerce.
8.  Establish  a  Task  Force  within  Commerce’s  Import  Administration  to  pursue 
the elimination of Foreign Unfair Trade Practices.
9.  Establish  an  office  within  Import  Administration  to  coordinate  cases  involv-
ing non-market economies.
10.  Enhance  the  U.S.  Government’s  efforts  on  behalf  of  U.S  manufacturing  by 
consolidating Commerce Department export promotion functions.
11. Accelerate implementation of the President’s National Export Strategy.
12.  Review  the  existing  structure  of  the  U.S.  foreign-trade  zone  program  to  de-
termine how it could be enhanced to provide a greater incentive to manufacture 
in the U.S.
13. Promote health savings accounts.
14. Adopt and implement bar coding of medical products.
15. Reduce the burden of regulations on manufacturing enterprises.
16. Create an interagency working group on manufacturing research and devel-
opment.
17.  Encourage  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  and  Small  Business 
Technology Transfer Programs to focus on manufacturing.
18. Enact class-action reform.
19. Expand the reach of programs designed to provide technical assistance.
20. Promote global recognition of U.S. technical standards.
21. Create an interagency federal task force to address the structural economic 
challenges faced by manufacturing-dependent communities.

Question 2. If manufacturing is such an important priority for the Administration, 
why  does  the  President  continue  to  cut  the  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership, 
a  program  that  assists  small  and  medium  sized  manufacturers  become  more  com-
petitive? 

Answer. The fiscal discipline required in developing this budget forced us to make 
some  tough  choices.  The  Administration  proposes  to  fund  the  Hollings  Manufac-
turing  Extension  Partnership  Program  (Hollings  MEP)  at  $46.8  million,  50  percent

29

of  the  FY  2005  grant  level.  At  this  level,  the  Administration  will  maintain  a  na-
tional network of centers while focusing funding based on centers’ performance and 
need.  The  FY  2006  Budget  is  not  intended  to  reduce  the  number  of  centers.  One 
of  the  strengths  of  the  Hollings  MEP  network  has  been  its  utility  to  other  federal 
agencies;  we  will  continue  to  aggressively  pursue  partnerships  to  leverage  the  net-
work.  Last  year,  federal  partners  provided  an  additional  $7  million  in  funding  to 
centers.

Question 3. Last year, the Congress passed a bill, S. 1134, reauthorizing the Eco-
nomic Development Administration. Could you please update the Committee on the 
progress that has been made implementing the Act including a timeline for Issuance 
of regulations? 

Answer.  EDA’s  regulations  have  been  drafted  and  are  in  the  final  stages  of  the 

clearance process.

Question  4.  When  do  you  expect  the  Administration  will  put  forward  a  nominee 

to head the Economic Development Administration? 

Answer.  The  Administration  is  committed  to  the  nomination  of  an  individual  to 
serve as Assistant Secretary of Economic Development as soon as possible. Such an 
announcement will be made by the White House.

Question  5.  We  have  learned  about  a  proposed  buyout  of  staff  at  the  Economic 
Development  Administration  (EDA).  Given  the  fact  that  the  Congress  so  far  has 
shown  no  indication  that  it  will  approve  the  consolidation  of  economic  development 
agencies  in  the  proposed  Strengthening  America’s  Communities  Initiative,  do  you 
think  reducing  manpower  is  the  wisest  course?  If  manpower  is  reduced  and  appro-
priations are not reduced, how will the EDA fulfill its mission as required by Public 
Law 108–373? 

Answer.  A  series  of  flat  or  decreasing  budgets  since  FY  2002  for  salaries  and  ex-
penses  (S&E)  combined  with  increasing  costs  for  salaries  and  inflation  have  re-
quired that EDA absorb approximately $1.2 million annually from its S&E base, the 
equivalent of 10–11 FTE. Through FY 2004, savings realized from the Headquarters 
Restructuring  combined  with  other  cost  reduction  measures  have  enabled  EDA  to 
operate within the resources available. 

EDA  received  another  reduced  budget  in  FY  2005.  In  order  to  continue  to  effec-
tively  manage  within  the  resources  available  this  fiscal  year,  EDA  must  reduce  its 
workforce.  In  order  to  accomplish  this  with  the  minimum  adverse  impact  possible, 
EDA is proposing to offer Voluntary Early Retirement Authority and Voluntary Sep-
aration Incentive Payments (buyouts) for up to the amount of funds available. 

While the Congress has not yet addressed an appropriation for the Strengthening 
America’s Communities Initiative, the House Commerce, Justice and Science Appro-
priations  Subcommittee  FY  2006  mark  for  EDA  would  appropriate  $53  million  less 
in  program  funding  and  $3.5  million  less  in  S&E  funding  than  the  FY  2005  levels. 
EDA  must  plan  for  this  significantly  larger  budget  reduction  of  12  percent,  making 
the  accomplishment  of  buyouts  in  FY  2005  even  more  important  for  the  Agency  to 
be able to continue to operate without adverse actions such as furloughs or involun-
tary reductions. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO

DAVID A. SAMPSON 

Question  1.  As  you  know,  an  independent  Commission  last  year  released  a  com-
prehensive  report  on  U.S.  ocean  policy.  This  report  included  more  than  200  rec-
ommendations on ways to improve U.S. ocean policy. Have you reviewed this report? 
As  you  will  have  jurisdiction  over  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Adminis-
tration, how do you plan to incorporate some of these recommendations? 

Answer.  While  I  have  not  personally  read  the  entire  report  of  the  U.S.  Commis-
sion  on  Ocean  Policy,  I  have  been  briefed  on  the  report  and  I  am  familiar  with  its 
contents.  In  December  2004,  the  Administration  released  its  response  to  the  Ocean 
Commission Report in the ‘‘U.S. Ocean Action Plan.’’ This Action Plan identifies im-
mediate, short-term, and long-term actions that will provide the direction for the fu-
ture  of  U.S.  ocean  policy.  Specifically,  the  Action  Plan  includes  activities  that  are 
designed to: improve Federal coordination; develop an ocean research priorities plan 
and  implementation  strategy;  build  an  ocean-observing  system;  support  market-
based fisheries; and develop and deploy new state-of-the-art research vessels. Along 
with the U.S. Ocean Action Plan, the President signed an Executive Order that cre-
ated  a  Cabinet-Level  Committee  on  Ocean  Policy  that  will  advise  the  President  on 
domestic policies concerning ocean-related matters. I am committed to assist the Ad-
ministration  in  the  implementation  of  the  U.S.  Ocean  Action  Plan  and  the  rec-

ommendations of the Committee on Ocean Policy to ensure the vitality of our ocean 
resources.

Question 2. Do you view our trade deficit as a problem? 
Answer. The trade deficit is a matter of concern to the United States, but not the 
only  measure  of  the  success  of  our  economic  policies.  Our  strong  GDP  growth  rel-
ative to the major regional economies around the globe is a significant driver in our 
ability  to  purchase  goods  and  services  from  abroad.  Slow  economic  growth  in  our 
major  trading  partners  has  slowed  the  appetite  for  U.S.  goods  and  services.  We 
must continue to promote expansionary growth policies in those countries. 

Additionally, We must continue to increase exports by improving the competitive-
ness  of  American  companies  and  leveling  the  playing  field  for  U.S.  goods  and  serv-
ices.  We  also  need  to  increase  domestic  savings,  which  the  President  is  addressing 
through tax reforms.

Question  3.  What  steps  is  the  Commerce  Department  taking  to  prepare  for  the 

possible transfer of Community Development grants to the agency from HUD? 

Answer.  The  Department  of  Commerce  has  a  team  analyzing  the  staffing,  infra-
structure and administrative requirements for the new bureau. The Administration 
will develop projections for the Salaries and Expense requirements of the Strength-
ening  America’s  Communities  Initiative  in  conjunction  with  legislative  authority 
granted  by  Congress  and  recommendations  from  relevant  federal  agencies  and  var-
ious stakeholders.

Question 4. What expertise exists at Commerce to administer the CDBG program? 
Answer. It should be noted that the President’s Strengthening America’s Commu-
nities  Initiative  is  not  a  consolidation  of  the  CDBG  program  into  the  Department 
of  Commerce.  The  Initiative  will  transfer  funding  for  18  community  and  economic 
development  programs  across  the  Federal  Government  into  one  housed  within  the 
Department of Commerce. We anticipate that the new program will incorporate the 
full  range  of  flexible  uses  available  under  all  of  the  current  grant  programs.  The 
Strengthening America’s Communities Initiative is not simply a community develop-
ment  or  a  housing  assistance  program  (a  common  use  of  CDBG  funding)—it  is  an 
extremely  flexible  community  and  economic  development  program  that  can,  at  a 
community’s  discretion,  provide  assistance  associated  with  any  number  of  different 
community needs or local development priorities. 

One  of  the  key  reasons  the  President  selected  the  Department  of  Commerce  as 
the  home  for  the  new  program  is  that  of  all  the  federal  departments  engaged  in 
community and economic development, the Commerce Department has had the most 
success in leveraging the resources of the private sector. 

Furthermore,  the  Department  of  Commerce  has  a  40-year  track  record  of  pro-
viding grants to both urban and rural areas in support of community and economic 
development  initiatives  in  all  50  states  and  U.S.  territories.  The  Department  of 
Commerce manages a broad array of grant programs in the Economic Development 
Administration,  the  Minority  Business  Development  Agency,  the  National  Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Adminis-
tration. 

Currently, Commerce manages an active $2.3 billion portfolio of grants and loans 
specifically focused on community and economic development, encompassing diverse 
types  of  projects  such  as  public  works,  economic  adjustment,  disaster  recovery  as-
sistance,  military  base  realignment,  strategic  planning,  and  economic  development 
research. 

The  Department  also  funds  an  extensive  network  of  University  Centers,  regional 
development  councils,  economic  development  districts,  and  community  development 
organizations, whose missions are to promote community and economic and develop-
ment initiatives. All this experience will be incorporated into the Commerce Depart-
ment’s administration of the President’s initiative.

Question  5.  I  believe  America’s  communities  deserve  the  same  financial  support 
and  service  from  our  government  as  the  efforts  to  rebuild  in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq. 
How  do  I  respond  to  my  constituents  who  write  me  that  we  are  cutting  important 
domestic  programs  for  community  and  economic  development,  while  spending  more 
money abroad to rebuild Iraq? 

Answer.  The  President  is  proposing  to  focus  scarce  resources  on  America’s  need-
iest  communities.  Currently  there  are  35  federal  programs  in  seven  different  agen-
cies  that  address  economic  and  community  development.  In  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2005, 
Congress  allocated  $16.2  billion  to  these  programs.  For  FY  2006,  the  President  is 
proposing  to  spend  $15.5  billion  on  these  programs,  a  reduction  of  only  4  percent. 
This  4  percent  reduction  across  community  and  economic  development  programs  is 
consistent  with  spending  restraint  in  other  non-defense,  non-homeland  security 
areas.  The  FY  2006  Budget  reflects  the  President’s  commitment  to  providing  the

critical  resources  for  our  Nation’s  highest  priorities:  fighting  the  war  on  terror, 
strengthening  our  homeland  defenses,  and  sustaining  the  momentum  of  our  eco-
nomic  recovery.  Overall,  the  Budget  focuses  on  priorities  while  targeting  resources 
on the most successful and results-oriented programs.
