SAFETY  AND  SECURITY  OF 

SPENT  NUCLEAR  FUEL  TRANSPORTATION 

WEDNESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  24,  2008 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:03  p.m.,  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The CHAIRMAN. Accomplishing the safe and secure transportation 
of  nuclear  waste  is  one  of  the  more  complex  challenges  facing  our 
government.  Spent  nuclear  fuel  is  the  byproduct  of  the  nuclear 
power  industry  that  supplies  electric  energy  to  millions  across  the 
country  and  also  is  created  by  our  armed  forces.  This  fuel  retains 
its  radioactive  qualities  for  thousands  of  years  and  is  currently 
stored  at  77  commercial  and  government  sites  across  the  country. 
We are not here to discuss the merits of the Department of Ener-
gy’s selection of Yucca Mountain, Nevada as a site for a permanent 
underground geological repository to store nuclear waste or its cur-
rent license application. Rather, we must ensure that all shipments 
of  spent  nuclear  fuel  and  high-level  waste  are  held  to  the  highest 
safety and security standards. 

Today  nuclear  waste  is  transported  by  rail,  truck,  and  barge,  all 
of which are under the jurisdiction of this Committee, and the risks 
of  transporting  nuclear  waste  must  be  fully  understood  and  evalu-
ated  and  a  system  of  transportation  must  be  designed  to  fully  ad-
dress these risks. 

In  this  hearing,  we  will  examine  the  current  regulatory  regime 
for  nuclear  waste  transportation  and  hear  from  researchers  and  a 
representative  of  the  rail  industry  in  order  to  more  fully  under-
stand the challenges of transporting nuclear waste. It is this Com-
mittee’s  obligation  to  evaluate  these  challenges  and  to  ensure  that 
spent  nuclear  fuel  and  high-level  radioactive  waste  is  transported 
in  ways  that  minimize  the  safety  and  security  risks  to  the  general 
public. 

With  that,  may  I  first  welcome  the  delegation  from  Nevada,  but 
I  will  call  upon  Senator  Ensign.  Afterwards  he  will  come  up  here. 
Senator Ensign?

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Senator ENSIGN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for holding 
this hearing. As you know, the Nevada delegation has been unified 
as  Nevadans,  as  most  Nevadans  are  in  opposition  to  the  Yucca 
Mountain  project,  and  part  of  that  project  is  the  whole  idea  of 
transporting nuclear waste. I realize that that is what this hearing 
is  about  today,  but  we  also  need  to  educate  Americans  what  this 
means—where  is  this  nuclear  waste  going  to  be  transported,  and 
what  are  the  parameters  in  studying  how  safe  this  nuclear  waste 
is to transport. 

But  we  also  have  to  look  at  the  costs  associated.  I  remember  a 
few years ago, Senator Reid and I saying when the cost estimates, 
about 5 years ago, for Yucca Mountain were about the mid-$50 mil-
lion  range,  and  Senator  Reid  and  I  testified  that  the  cost  is  going 
to  go  at  least  to  $100  billion,  and  probably  north  of  $100  billion 
would be the cost of Yucca Mountain. People kind of said, no, that 
is  not  right.  Those  are  way  over  estimate.  Well,  now  the  most  re-
cent cost estimate for Yucca Mountain is $96 billion. 

What a lot of people do not realize, especially those who want to 
get  the  nuclear  waste  out  of  their  state,  which  then  leads  to  the 
transportation,  is  Yucca  Mountain,  the  way  it  is  currently  being 
constructed,  will  only  handle  the  nuclear  waste  that  has  been  pro-
duced  by  this  country  up  to  this  point.  It  does  not  handle  any  nu-
clear waste that this country will be producing into the future. 

And  so  I  think  that  while  we  are  studying  transportation  issues 
and talking about the transportation issues, we should also look at 
whether  we  need  to  transport  it  at  this  point.  We  need  to  look  at 
other  technologies  that  other  countries  are  doing,  like  France,  and 
the amount and how they transport their waste, but also what they 
do  with  their  waste.  Basically  they  recycle  their  waste,  and  they 
have a lot smaller volume. 

But  we  also  have  to  tell  the  American  people,  who  have  nuclear 
powerplants  in  their  state  that  think  that  they  are  getting  rid  of 
all  of  their  nuclear  waste,  that  that  in  fact  is  not  the  case.  I  re-
member  when  Spence  Abraham  was  the  Secretary  of  Energy  and 
he came and he was talking about—this was right after 9/11—and 
the safety, that we need one repository. So we bring all the nuclear 
waste to one repository. 

Well,  the  fact  is  that  when  you  have  a  spent  nuclear  fuel  rod,  it 
needs to cool for several years in cooling pools before you can actu-
ally transport it, before you could take it to a repository, if that is, 
indeed,  what  you  wanted  to  do.  So  there  is  going  to  be  nuclear 
waste or partially spent nuclear fuel rods all over the country. 

Those are just some of the issues I believe that are important to 
talk  to  the  American  people  and  to  be  honest  with  the  American 
people.  Is  this  a  policy  that  we  should  continue?  I  do  not  believe 
it  is.  I  believe  that  we  should  catch  up  with  the  rest  of  the  world 
on  some  of  the  modern  recycling  technologies,  and  in  doing  so,  we 
can  address  the  transportation  issues.  But  we  should  be  honest 
with  the  American  people  what  the  transportation  issues  are, 
where  those  transportation  routes  are  and  be  honest  with  them 
and look at other countries and what they have done with it.

But  we  also,  in  light  of  that,  need  to  look  at  whether  or  not 
Yucca  Mountain  is  the  place  that  we  want  to  take  very  valuable 
fuel,  whether  we  want  to  look  at  onsite  dry  cask  storage,  which  is 
good  for  100  to  200  years,  which,  by  the  way,  would  obviate  the 
need  for  transporting  nuclear  waste,  and  then  we  should  look  at 
the recycling efforts as well. 

So  I  have  a  formal  statement  and  would  ask  that  that  be  made 

part of the record. 

But,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  you  holding  this  hearing  today 
and listening to two concerned Nevadans who happen to represent 
a lot of other Nevadans on this important issue to our state. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Ensign follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN ENSIGN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on 

behalf of the people of Nevada. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  be  clear:  Yucca  Mountain  is  not  an  issue  that  af-
fects  just  the  residents  of  Nevada—it  is  an  issue  that  affects  every  American.  I  am 
here  today  to  explain  that  the  plan  to  store  spent  nuclear  fuel  at  Yucca  Mountain 
is  not  a  solution.  The  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  at  Yucca  Mountain  is  a  plan 
plagued by unrealistic assumptions about cost, poor transportation and waste man-
agement planning, and insufficient scientific testing to ensure the safety of our com-
munities. I believe that we can do better. 

I have bad news for those of you with working nuclear reactors in your states who 
think that the opening of Yucca will rid your state of nuclear waste—you’re wrong. 
You see, even if it were possible to immediately and magically remove all of the ex-
isting  spent  fuel  from  commercial  nuclear  power  plant  locations,  there  would  still 
continue to be spent fuel stored at each and every operating reactor in the country. 
That’s  because  nuclear  waste  is  highly  radioactive  and  thermally  hot  and  must  be 
kept  at  the  reactor  sites  in  water-filled  cooling  pools  for  at  least  5  years.  The  only 
way  spent  fuel  storage  can  be  eliminated  from  a  reactor  location  is  to  shut  down 
the reactor. And that isn’t an option. 

Mr.  Chairman,  let’s  also  consider  the  long-range  cost  of  Yucca  Mountain.  The 
most  recent  estimates  of  the  cost  of  Yucca  Mountain  are  nearing  $100  billion—and 
I am pretty certain it will go higher. What do we get for our money? The same prob-
lem  we  have  today.  We  will  have  65,000  metric  tons  of  commercial  nuclear  waste 
by  the  time  Yucca  Mountain  is  scheduled  to  open.  We  produce  2,000  metric  tons  of 
nuclear  waste  a  year.  The  DOE  plans  to  transport  3,000  metric  tons  a  year.  Just 
do  the  math.  We  won’t  get  rid  of  the  nuclear  waste  backlog  for  nearly  a  century 
and Yucca Mountain will be filled long before then. 

And  under  the  Department  of  Energy’s  plan,  there  is  no  requirement  for  the  old-
est  and  most  thermally  cool,  spent  fuel  to  be  shipped  first.  Without  this  sort  of  re-
quirement, nuclear facilities will have the incentive to ship out more recently spent 
fuel  that  is  hotter  and  more  dangerous  to  transport.  Unfortunately,  this  is  just  an-
other hole in DOE’s plan for Yucca Mountain. 

And Mr. Chairman, the NRC hasn’t even conducted full-scale physical tests on ac-
tual  spent  fuel  casks.  I  wouldn’t  put  my  children  in  a  car  that  hadn’t  been  crash 
tested,  but  I’m  supposed  to  put  them  on  a  highway  next  to  a  truck  with  casks  of 
nuclear  waste  that  haven’t  been  adequately  tested.  In  fact,  experts  from  the  Na-
tional  Research  Council  have  examined  this  issue  and  strongly  endorse  the  use  of 
full-scale  testing  to  determine  how  packages  will  respond  to  real-world  conditions. 
These casks are going to be traveling by homes, schools, and churches. And at this 
time we can’t be sure they will survive real-world conditions. For example, the casks 
have not been tested in fully engulfing long-duration fires. The testing is for 30 min-
utes  at  1475  degrees  Fahrenheit.  The  temperature  in  the  Baltimore  tunnel  fire 
reached 1500 degrees Fahrenheit, and the fire burned for hours. 

It  doesn’t  seem  to  me  that  the  proponents  of  the  Yucca  Mountain  have  done 
enough  to  prove  that  the  plan  is  safe,  and  the  entire  Nevada  delegation  has  con-
cerns. To address this, the Nevada Congressional delegation will be sending a letter 
to  the  Surface  Transportation  Board  outlining  our  concerns  regarding  the  construc-
tion and operation of a rail line from eastern Nevada to the proposed nuclear waste 
repository at Yucca Mountain. 

So if Yucca Mountain isn’t the answer, what is?

Mr.  Chairman,  we  should  keep  that  waste  right  where  it  is,  safely  stored  for  the 
time  being.  The  Federal  Government  should  offer  to  take  title  and  liability  to  the 
waste stored on site, just as it did in Pennsylvania under the PECO settlement. The 
NRC  has  stated  fuel  can  be  stored  safely  on  site  for  at  least  100  years  in  dry  cask 
storage.  That  leaves  plenty  of  time  to  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  at  our 
National  Labs  to  recycle  the  waste  without  producing  weapons-grade  plutonium  as 
a byproduct. 

I  believe  that  we  need  to  do  what  this  country  does  best:  innovate  and  lead  the 
world  in  cutting  edge  technologies.  Unfortunately,  with  Yucca  Mountain,  we  have 
been way behind the curve on how we manage our spent nuclear fuel. For instance, 
the  French  store  their  spent  fuel  byproducts  in  above-ground  repositories—this 
model seems to make more sense for a country as large as ours. It seems to me that 
we  should  be  using  $100  billion  in  Yucca  funding  to  develop  new  recycling  tech-
nologies and make a dent in the challenge of managing spent fuel. 

And  managing  spent  nuclear  fuel  is  a  serious  challenge  we  face.  As  a  legislator, 
like all of you, I need to be fully informed about the effects of legislation on my con-
stituents before I vote. I know that Yucca Mountain will be bad for both the people 
of Nevada and the United States. It comes down to this: you are being asked to risk 
the health and safety of your constituents for a scheme that will leave this country 
looking for another nuclear waste storage site 24 years after Yucca Mountain opens. 
It’s just not worth it. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Senator, and your state-

ment will be made part of the record. If you will join me. 

Now it is my pleasure to present a most distinguished American, 
the Leader of the Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate, the Hon-
orable Harry Reid. 

STATEMENT OF HON. HARRY REID, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

Senator  REID.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very,  very  much.  I  very 
much  appreciate  you  chairing  this  meeting.  Your  service  to  the 
country  is  well  known  and  being  Chairman  of  this  most  important 
Committee is also part of your legacy. 

Senator Ensign and I are speaking for Nevadans, but we are also 
speaking  for  people  all  over  this  country.  And  there  will  be  testi-
mony  today  by  those  on  Panel  II  that  will  talk  about  the  dangers 
to  the  American  people  outside  Nevada  of  transporting  the  most 
poisonous substance known to man. 

We  have  not  looked  at  this  for  some  time,  the  issue  of  nuclear 
waste.  I  have  said  and  I  believe  without  any  question  that  Yucca 
Mountain  is  dead.  The  money  being  spent  on  it  is  a  big  waste  of 
taxpayers’ dollars. 

Now,  this  is  a  busy  week,  but  this  hearing  is  necessary  because 
the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  has  just  docketed  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  application  to  be  in  construction  at  Yucca  Moun-
tain. 

Like  its  application,  the  Department  of  Energy’s  nuclear  waste 
shipping  plans  are  grossly—grossly—incomplete.  Yet,  the  Depart-
ment wants to spend over $3 billion to start building a 300-mile ra-
dioactive railway through Nevada. They want to do this before they 
even have permission to build the dump. Anything to divert atten-
tion from the dump is what they are involved in. 

It amazes me and people who have watched this Yucca Mountain 
project  since  the  early  1980s  how  long  the  Department  of  Energy 
has  pushed  this  Yucca  project  with  having  no  transportation  plan 
in  place.  They  have  not  made  public  its  proposed  shipping  routes. 
They  have  not  finalized  the  national  transportation  plan.  Their

draft  transportation  plan  is  barely  a  crude  sketch  of  the  com-
prehensive planning that should actually be done for a massive nu-
clear waste shipping program. 

Equally  shocking  is  that  the  transportation  of  aging  disposal 
casks  the  Department  of  Energy  plans  to  use  have  not  been  de-
signed  yet.  The  Department  says  that  90  percent  of  the  nuclear 
waste will be shipped using these transportation storage canisters, 
but  they  have  absolutely  no  reason  to  believe  that  this  is  true. 
There  is  no  guarantee  that  nuclear  utilities  are  actually  willing  to 
pay  for  these  canisters,  especially  those  that  already  use  dry  cask 
storage to securely store their waste. 

Not  from  here  is  the  Calvert  Hills  nuclear  generating  facility. 
They  have  for  years  stored  the  stuff  onsite,  saving  millions  and 
millions of dollars, and certainly it is safe. 

After  9/11,  the  thought  of  shipping  this  poisonous  substance  on 
highways and railways across the country is at the very least very 
scary.  But  these  untested,  yet-to-be-designed  canisters  are  part  of 
the foundation of the Yucca plan. The key defense against a trans-
portation disaster—one of the Department of Energy’s primary bar-
riers against radioactive leakage from the nuclear waste dump. But 
that  is  not  important  to  the  Department  now  because  the  Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  has  made  the  decision  that  the  Depart-
ment of Energy’s license application for Yucca was complete. 

In  order  to  get  all  the  nation’s  nuclear  waste  at  Yucca,  the  En-
ergy  Department  is  proposing  between  3,000  and  11,000  rail  ship-
ments and as many as 10,000 truck shipments twice a week for the 
next  24  years.  Trains  loaded  with  this  substance  would  traverse 
the  country  traveling  to  Nevada.  Some  of  the  distances  would  be 
as  much  as  3,000  miles.  Many  of  these  shipments  would  go  right 
by  the  world’s  destination  resort,  Las  Vegas,  the  Strip.  Trains 
would  pass  within  a  half  mile  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  visitors 
on  any  given  day  to  Las  Vegas  that  hosts  tens  of  thousands  of 
workers. 

Texas  could  host  up  to  308  nuclear  waste  shipments  alone.  All 
these  shipments  would  go  through  Arizona  communities  just  from 
Texas, collecting even more waste perhaps even in Arizona. 

The  Department  of  Energy  and  nuclear  industry  lobbyists  will 
tell  you  that  the  risk  of  accident  is  low.  What  they  do  not  tell  you 
is the risk is a relative risk. Let us say it is 98 percent successful, 
even  99  percent.  That  means  there  would  be  5,000  botched  sur-
geries  each  year.  99  percent  gets  us  to  200,000  wrong  drug  pre-
scriptions each year. 99 percent gets us to 20,000 lost pieces of mail 
each hour. The point is simple. More nuclear waste on the road will 
certainly  involve  more  accidents.  Accidents  will  happen.  It  is  only 
a  question  of  where  and  when.  It  will  put  the  lives  of  millions  of 
Americans at risk. So I would ask the Department not to be throw-
ing around the 99 percent number because that is not valid in light 
of what could happen with that 1 percent. 

One of the things I fear is that the Department of Energy is not 
going for 100 percent success. They are not even trying to eliminate 
the  risk.  One  of  the  most  glaring  examples  is  their  refusal  to  con-
sider  shipping  the  oldest,  less  radioactive  nuclear  waste  first,  a 
basic measure that could reduce radiological hazards by 85 percent.

The  Members  of  the  Committee  should  ask  the  Department  of 
Energy  and  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  and  the  Academy  of 
Sciences  about  this  issue.  Both  the  Academy  and  the  Government 
Accountability Office told the Energy Department that they should 
ship  older  nuclear  waste  first.  The  state  of  Nevada,  which  under-
stands  the  risks,  has  urged  the  Department  to  consider  shipping 
the  oldest  first.  But  the  Department  of  Energy  has  made  up  its 
mind. The answer is no. It is not logical, but the answer is no. 

The  nuclear  power  industry  wants  to  get  rid  of  its  more  expen-
sive  and  most  radioactive  waste  first.  The  question  is  why  has  the 
Department  of  Energy  not  even  considered  shipping  the  oldest 
first.  They  do  not  mention  it  in  their  environmental  analysis  for 
transporting  waste  to  Yucca.  They  do  not  consider  it  in  their  draft 
national transportation plan. It is unfortunate that the Department 
of Energy once again is refusing to let logic get in the way of build-
ing its waste dump at Yucca. 

We all know that nuclear waste cannot be stored at Yucca safely, 
but  it  can  be  stored  safely  for  a  very  long  time  in  secure  dry  cask 
storage  containers.  If  allowing  nuclear  waste  to  cool  for  50  to  100 
years  improves  the  safety  of  shipping  in  the  future,  the  Depart-
ment should be seriously considering onsite storage, which they are 
not, even though scientists say it is the way to go. I say a majority 
of the scientists. 

Storing  waste  at  nuclear  reactors  not  in  the  earthquake-prone 
Yucca  Mountain  would  give  us  the  time  needed  to  develop  secure, 
scientifically  sound,  long-term  solutions  for  nuclear  waste.  Senator 
Ensign and I have been saying this from the beginning. 

As  Senator  Ensign  said,  Yucca’s  price  tag  is  now  approaching 
$100 billion. This is $49 billion more than the Department of Ener-
gy’s  2001  estimate.  The  cost  of  Yucca  increases  at  a  rate  of  $7  bil-
lion  a  year.  The  annual  payments  to  the  nuclear  waste  fund  are 
only a fraction of how much Yucca’s cost is increasing. The $22 bil-
lion  nuclear  waste  fund  will  never  ever  come  close  to  covering  the 
price of Yucca. The taxpayer will be on the limb for that. 

Terrible risks of transporting nuclear waste is yet another reason 
that  this  project  is  going  to  be  stopped.  That  is  why  I  appreciate 
very  much  the  Appropriations  Committee  cutting  back  the  money 
this  year.  It  will  be  cut  back  at  least  $70  million  from  last  year. 
Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  finally  say  that  there  has  been  a  lot  of 
cheerleading recently because this matter has been sent to the Nu-
clear  Regulatory  Commission.  Their  information  they  sent  is  in-
complete. They have nothing dealing with transportation. This is a 
hoax and it will never happen. Yucca Mountain will never come to 
be. 

Could I be excused, Mr. Chairman? 
[The prepared statement of Senator Reid follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. HARRY REID, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA 

I  want  to  thank  Chairman  Inouye,  Senator  Hutchison,  and  the  Members  of  the 
Committee for scheduling this important hearing. It has been a long time since the 
Senate has looked closely at plans to ship nuclear waste to Nevada. 

This is a very busy week. But this hearing is necessary now because the Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  has  just  docketed  the  Department  of  Energy’s  application 
to begin construction at Yucca Mountain.

Like its application, the Department of Energy’s nuclear waste shipping plans are 
grossly  incomplete.  Yet,  the  Department  really  wants  to  spend  over  $3  billion  to 
start building a 300-mile radioactive railway through Nevada. They want to do this 
before they even have permission to build the dump. 

It  amazes  me  how  long  the  Department  of  Energy  has  pushed  the  Yucca  project 
without  having  a  real  transportation  plan  in  place.  The  Department  has  not  made 
public  its  proposed  shipping  routes,  and  they  still  haven’t  finalized  their  National 
Transportation Plan. Their draft transportation plan is barely a crude sketch of the 
comprehensive  planning  that  should  actually  be  done  for  a  massive  nuclear  waste 
shipping campaign. 

Equally shocking is that the Transportation Aging and Disposal casks the Depart-
ment of Energy plans to use have not even been designed yet. The Department says 
that 90 percent of nuclear waste will be shipped using these transportation-storage 
canisters,  but  they  have  absolutely  no  reason  to  believe  that  this  is  true.  There  is 
no  guarantee  that  nuclear  utilities  are  actually  willing  to  pay  for  these  canisters, 
especially those that already use dry cask storage to securely store their waste. 

Yet  these  untested,  yet-to-be  designed  canisters  are  part  of  the  foundation  of  the 
Yucca  plan.  They’re  the  key  defense  against  a  transportation  disaster,  and  they’re 
one  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s  primary  barriers  against  radioactive  leakage 
from the nuclear waste dump. But that’s not important to the Department now, be-
cause the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has made the unexplainable decision that 
the Department of Energy’s license application for Yucca was complete. 

In order to get all of the nation’s nuclear waste to Yucca, the Energy Department 
is proposing between 3,000 and 11,000 rail shipments, and as many as 10,000 truck 
shipments  through  Nevada.  Twice  a  week  for  the  next  24  years,  trains  loaded  with 
the most dangerous substance known to man would traverse the country to Nevada. 
Some  of  these  shipments  would  go  right  by  the  Las  Vegas  Strip.  Radioactive 
trains would pass within one-half mile of 95,000 residents and 34 hotels that employ 
and  host  40,000  workers  and  visitors.  Texas  could  host  up  to  300  nuclear  waste 
shipments.  All  of  these  shipments  will  go  through  Arizona  communities  too,  col-
lecting even more waste at the Palo Verde nuclear plant. 

The  Department  of  Energy  and  nuclear  industry  lobbyists  will  tell  you  that  the 

risk of an accident is low. 

What they don’t tell you is that risk is relative—99 percent success gets us 5,000 
botched  surgeries  each  week.  99  percent  gets  us  200,000  wrong  drug  prescriptions 
each year. 99 percent gets us 20,000 lost pieces of mail each hour. My point is sim-
ple—more  nuclear  waste  on  the  road  will  involve  more  accidents  that  will  put  the 
lives  of  millions  of  Americans  at  risk.  I  don’t  want  to  see  what  99  percent  gets  us 
when nuclear waste is involved. 

What  I  fear  most  is  that  the  Department  of  Energy  is  not  going  for  100  percent 
success. They are not even trying to eliminate all the risk. One of the most glaring 
examples  is  their  refusal  to  consider  shipping  the  oldest,  less  radioactive  nuclear 
waste first—a very basic measure that could reduce radiological hazards by 85 per-
cent or more. 

I  urge  the  Members  of  the  Committee  to  ask  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  Nu-
clear  Regulatory  Commission,  and  the  Academy  of  Sciences  about  this  issue.  Both 
the  Academy  and  the  Government  Accountability  Office  have  told  the  Energy  De-
partment  they  should  ship  older  nuclear  waste  first.  The  state  of  Nevada—which 
understands  the  terrible  risks—has  urged  the  Department  to  consider  shipping  the 
oldest waste first. 

But the Department of Energy made up its mind. The answer was no. 
No, because the nuclear power industry wants to get rid of its more expensive and 

most radioactive waste first. 

My  question  is  why  hasn’t  the  Department  of  Energy  even  considered  shipping 
the  oldest  waste  first?  They  don’t  mention  it  in  their  environmental  analyses  for 
transporting waste to Yucca and they don’t consider it in their draft National Trans-
portation Plan. 

It’s  unfortunate  that  the  Energy  Department  once  again  is  refusing  to  let  logic 

get in the way of building its nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain. 

We all know that nuclear waste cannot be stored at nuclear reactors for eternity. 
But it can be safely stored for a very long time in secure dry storage casks. If allow-
ing  nuclear  waste  to  cool  for  50  to  100  years  improves  the  safety  of  shipping  it  in 
the  future,  the  Department  of  Energy  should  be  seriously  considering  on-site  dry 
cask storage. 

Storing  waste  at  nuclear  reactors,  not  in  the  earthquake-prone  Yucca  Mountain, 
would give us the time needed to develop secure, scientifically sound long-term solu-
tions for nuclear waste. Senator Ensign and I have been saying this all along.

Yucca’s  price  tag  is  now  $96  billion,  almost  $49  billion  MORE  than  the  Depart-
ment of Energy’s 2001 estimate. As the cost of Yucca increases at a rate of $7 billion 
a year, the annual payments to the Nuclear Waste Fund are only a fraction of how 
much  Yucca’s  cost  is  increasing.  The  $22  billion  Nuclear  Waste  Fund  will  never 
come close to covering the price of Yucca. 

The  terrible  risks  of  transporting  nuclear  waste  is  yet  another  reason  that  we 
need  to  stop  the  government  from  hemorrhaging  any  more  money  on  this  failed 
project. It’s time to keep Americans safe by keeping nuclear waste where it is. 

Again,  thank  you  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Hutchison  and  Members  of  the  Com-

mittee for this opportunity. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  And  I  thank  you  very  much  for  your  testimony, 

sir. 

Now  may  I  call  the  first  panel,  which  consists  of  the  following: 
the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Civilian  Radioactive  Waste  Manage-
ment,  U.S.  Department  of  Energy,  the  Honorable  Edward  Sproat; 
the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Nuclear  Material  Safety  and  Safe-
guards,  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission,  Mr.  Michael  Weber; 
the Director of the Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance, Fed-
eral  Railroad  Administration,  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation, 
Mr.  Ed  Pritchard;  and  the  Associate  Administrator  for  Hazardous 
Material Safety of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Mr. Ted 
Willke. 

Gentlemen, welcome, and may I begin with Director Sproat? 

STATEMENT  OF  HON.  EDWARD  F.  SPROAT  III,  DIRECTOR, 
OFFICE  OF  CIVILIAN  RADIOACTIVE  WASTE  MANAGEMENT, 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
Mr. SPROAT. Well, good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
very  much  for  the  invitation  to  appear  and  represent  the  Depart-
ment in front of the Committee to talk about the transportation of 
spent nuclear fuel. 

I ask that my formal testimony be entered into the record. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Your  statement  will  be  made  part  of  the  record. 
Mr. SPROAT. Thank you very much. 
I  am  going  to  keep  my  verbal  comments  very  brief  because  we 

have a number of folks to speak this afternoon. 

First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  say  that,  obviously,  there  is  a  lot  of 
misinformation  about  this  whole  issue  of  transportation  of  spent 
nuclear fuel and high-level waste. And I hope that in my comments 
I try and help the Committee understand some of those misconcep-
tions and try and straighten out some of the information. 

First  of  all,  the  concept  of—as  you  pointed  out  in  your  opening 
statement,  the  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  and  high-level 
waste in this country is not something new. We have been shipping 
that  hazardous  material  across  the  country  by  both  rail  and  truck 
for  over  40  years.  And  to  be  specific,  just  in  the  U.S.  alone  in  the 
last  40  years,  there  have  been  over  3,000  shipments  of  spent  nu-
clear  fuel  and  over  6,000  shipments  of  transuranic  waste  by  truck 
to the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in New Mexico since it opened. 
So there is a huge experience base in this country on how to trans-
port  radioactive  materials  safely  and  effectively.  And  in  all  those 
shipments,  there  has  never  once  been  any  release  of  any  radioac-
tivity in the public environment. 

There have been accidents, but none of those accidents have ever 
resulted  in  any  releases  because  of  the  very  robust  containers  and

the very robust regulations that the Department of Transportation 
and  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  places  on  that  transpor-
tation. And I will let the representatives of those organizations talk 
a little bit more about that in their presentations. 

For  Yucca  Mountain,  which  obviously  is  one  of  the  issues  at  the 
heart of this discussion in this hearing, I just want to make a com-
parison  that  compared  to  the  3,000  spent  nuclear  fuel  shipments 
made  so  far  in  this  country,  at  its  peak  of  operation  at  Yucca,  we 
are  expecting  that  approximately  320  rail  cars,  which  is  two  to 
three trains per week of shipments, will go from other places in the 
country  to  Yucca,  and  over  25  years,  it  would  be  320  rail  cars,  or 
about  two  to  three  trains  per  week  is  what  the  total  number  of 
shipments  would  be  to  Yucca  via  rail  and  approximately  90  truck 
shipments  per  year.  That  compares  to  the  existing  transportation 
today in the U.S. of all hazardous materials of approximately 1 mil-
lion  rail  cars  of  shipments  in  this  country  of  hazardous  materials, 
as  classified  by  the  Department  of  Transportation.  So  when  you 
take  a  look  at  the  total  environment  of  hazardous  waste  transport 
in this country, radioactive materials is a very, very small percent-
age,  and  Yucca  Mountain  would  be  an  even  smaller  percentage  of 
that.  So  that  is  just  to  give  you  some  kind  of  a  context  relative  to 
the  other  hazardous  material  transportation  this  country  already 
does and already accepts on a daily basis. 

Dr.  Crowley  will  talk  later  this  afternoon  about  the  National 
Academy of Sciences study which really addressed this whole issue, 
I think, very, very well. And it concluded that the risks to the pub-
lic  from  shipping  spent  nuclear  fuel  are  orders  of  magnitude  less 
than  the  risks  associated  with  a  number  of  other  hazardous  mate-
rials  like  chlorine  and  like  some  of  the  other  gases  and  chemicals 
that  are  shipped  across  the  country,  whose  risks  we  routinely  ac-
cept.  And  so  I  think  the  National  Academy  study,  when  you  hear 
from Dr. Crowley, will put this in a little more perspective in terms 
of  comparative  risks  of  nuclear  material  shipment  versus  other 
hazardous waste shipment. 

We  at  the  Department  of  Energy  have  been  working  since  1992 
with  states,  county,  tribal,  and  local  governments  in  what  we  call 
our  Transportation  External  Coordination  Working  Group  to  start 
to  work  together  with  these  various  entities  about  the  transpor-
tation  issues  associated  with  Yucca  Mountain,  both  by  rail  and  by 
truck.  We  have  a  very  good  working  relationship  with  them,  and 
we  are  committed  to  continuing  that  working  relationship  with 
them. We know that any successful transportation campaign in the 
future  will  require  a  very  strong  working  relationship  with  those 
local communities. 

So  in  summary,  as  we  have  the  opportunity  to  talk  about  this  a 
little  bit  more  this  afternoon,  I  would  like  to  leave  the  Committee 
with the sense that, number one, this has been going on for a long 
time, the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radio-
active waste. 

The  risks,  as  assessed  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  are 
significantly  lower  than  the  risks  associated  with  the  existing 
transportation of hazardous materials in the U.S. 

There are significantly more shipments of hazardous materials in 
the  U.S.  than  nuclear  materials,  and  we  believe  we  have  a  very

strong and successful regime of regulation, both from the NRC and 
the Department of Transportation, which DOE is committed to ad-
hering to as we go forward with the Yucca Mountain transportation 
campaign. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Sproat follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD F. SPROAT III, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF 
CIVILIAN RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am Edward F. Sproat III, Direc-
tor of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Man-
agement  (OCRWM).  I  appreciate  the  invitation  to  appear  before  the  Committee  to 
discuss the safety and security of transporting spent nuclear fuel. 

Since the early 1960s, more than 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel have been 
conducted  safely  and  securely  in  the  United  States,  having  traveled  more  than  1.7 
million  miles.  There  has  never  been  a  spent  nuclear  fuel  transportation  accident 
that has resulted in any release of radioactive material harmful to the public or the 
environment.  The  use  of  robust  casks  certified  by  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commis-
sion  (NRC),  and  strict  regulatory  standards  for  every  aspect  of  logistics,  including 
material characterization, packaging, loading, marking, equipment inspections, rout-
ing,  training,  security,  and  shipment  monitoring,  have  all  contributed  to  this  out-
standing safety record. 

In  2006,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  published  a  study  on  the  safety  of 
spent  nuclear  fuel  shipments  titled:  Going  the  Distance?  The  Safe  Transport  of 
Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste in the United States. In that 
report,  the  Academy  concluded  that  from  a  technical  viewpoint,  these  shipments 
present ‘‘. . . a low-radiological-risk activity with manageable safety, health and en-
vironmental consequences when conducted in strict adherence with existing regula-
tions.’’ The plans to ship spent nuclear fuel to the Yucca Mountain repository in the 
2020 time-frame are building on this successful experience base. 
Roles and Relationships 

The  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and  the  NRC  have  established  safety 
and  security  regulations  for  transport  of  spent  nuclear  fuel.  DOE  has  committed  to 
meet  or  exceed  these  regulations  for  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain.  The  Nuclear 
Waste  Policy  Act  of  1982,  as  amended  (NWPA)  explicitly  requires  the  Department 
to ship spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to a repository in trans-
portation casks certified by the NRC. Under the NWPA, the Department must also 
comply  with  NRC  notification  requirements  prior  to  conducting  such  shipments.  In 
addition, the NWPA requires the Department to provide states and tribes technical 
assistance  and  funds  for  training  local  public  safety  officials  in  safe  routine  trans-
portation and emergency response procedures. The Department has selected mostly 
rail  as  the  preferred  mode  of  transport  both  nationally  and  in  the  state  of  Nevada 
for  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain.  The  Department  also  has  made  the  policy  deci-
sion to use dedicated trains as the usual mode of rail service to enhance operational 
efficiency. 

As  the  planning  process  for  the  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  system  evolves, 
we are continually looking for opportunities to further enhance the safety and secu-
rity  of  these  shipments.  Post  9/11,  the  NRC  has  also  imposed  additional  security 
measures for its licensees transporting spent nuclear fuel and other materials, many 
of  which  were  measures  DOE  had  put  in  place  for  its  shipments  years  before.  We 
are  and  will  continue  to  coordinate  our  planning  closely  with  NRC,  DOT,  and  the 
Department of Homeland Security. 

Once  routes  and  shipment  schedules  are  established,  advance  notification  will  be 
provided  to  individuals  that  have  appropriate  security  clearance  in  each  Governor’s 
office  in  compliance  with  NRC  regulations.  All  shipments  will  be  accompanied  by 
armed escorts and will be continuously monitored and tracked via satellite. We an-
ticipate that most rail shipments will be conducted on dedicated trains, meaning no 
other  materials  will  be  transported  on  the  same  train,  allowing  for  greater  oper-
ational  control  of  such  shipments.  Highway  and  rail  shipments  will  be  thoroughly 
inspected  in  accordance  with  standards  of  the  Commercial  Vehicle  Safety  Alliance 
or  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration,  as  appropriate,  prior  to  departing  from 
their points of origin.

Challenges and Issues 

11 

In their report on the safety of spent nuclear fuel shipments referenced above, the 
National  Academy  of  Sciences  addressed  the  relative  risks  of  these  shipments  com-
pared  to  other  hazardous  materials  commonly  transported  in  this  country.  Their 
findings  demonstrate  that  each  spent  nuclear  fuel  shipment  is  thousands  of  times 
less risky than shipments of other commonly transported hazardous materials. This 
level  of  safety  is  the  direct  result  of  the  stringent  regulatory  standards  and  robust 
packages used for such shipments.1 

In  addition  to  the  lower  risks  for  each  shipment  of  spent  nuclear  fuel,  there  are 
far fewer of these shipments per year than shipments of other hazardous materials. 
In  2006,  American  railroads  transported  hazardous  materials  111  billion  ton-miles 
in over 1,000,000 rail cars. Of this total, less than 0.025 percent were spent nuclear 
fuel shipments. 

The  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  transportation  industry,  the  state  of  Ne-
vada, and a broad spectrum of other stakeholders advocated strongly for a transpor-
tation system based on mostly rail shipments. Over the life of the repository, fewer 
than  3,000  trains  can  transport  the  same  amount  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  that  would 
require  more  than  48,000  truck  shipments.  In  addition,  the  use  of  Transportation, 
Aging,  and  Disposal  canisters,  which  weigh  up  to  180  tons  in  their  transportation 
configuration, requires the use of rail transport. 

A  significant  fleet  of  transportation  casks  has  to  be  developed  to  support  ship-
ments to Yucca Mountain. That process has started with funding for the design and 
certification of the Transportation, Aging and Disposal canisters and their transpor-
tation  overpacks.  Funding  to  support  development  of  a  fleet  of  approximately  150 
transport  casks  that  meet  the  stringent  safety  requirements  of  the  NRC  is  needed 
as  part  of  the  transportation  system.  In  addition,  the  Department  needs  to  develop 
a  fleet  of  rail  cars  with  the  best  available  safety  technology.  These  rail  cars  will 
meet  the  new  requirements  established  by  the  Association  of  American  Railroads. 
The Department is collaborating with the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program on de-
velopment  of  the  next  generation  of  security  escort  rail  cars  designed  to  this  new 
standard. 
Current Status and Steps Moving Forward 

In  a  2004  Record  of  Decision,  the  Department  selected  mostly  rail  as  its  mode  of 
transport, both nationally and in the state of Nevada. In June 2008, the Department 
completed the ‘‘Final Environmental Impact Statement for a Rail Alignment for the 
Construction  and  Operation  of  a  Railroad  in  Nevada  to  a  Geologic  Repository  at 
Yucca  Mountain,  Nye  County,  Nevada’’  (Rail  Alignment  EIS).  The  Rail  Alignment 
EIS analyzes the environmental impacts associated with a range of potential align-
ments  for  constructing  and  operating  a  railroad  in  Nevada  to  Yucca  Mountain. 
There  was  considerable  public  involvement  in  the  development  of  the  EIS  and  a 
Record of Decision is anticipated this fall. 

As we move forward the Department will continue its ongoing collaborations with 
States, Tribes and stakeholders as we fulfill our commitment to establish a safe and 
secure  transportation  system  for  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain.  I  appreciate  the 
Committee’s interest on this important aspect of the Department’s Yucca Mountain 
Program. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, sir. 
Our next witness is Director Weber. 

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL WEBER, DIRECTOR 

NUCLEAR MATERIAL SAFETY AND SAFEGUARDS 

U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 

Mr.  WEBER.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Senator  Ensign. 
It  is  my  pleasure  to  appear  before  you  today  to  represent  the  staff 
of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission concerning the Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission’s  role  in  ensuring  the  safety  and  the  secu-
rity of potential transportation of spent fuel, including the potential 
transport  of  that  spent  fuel  to  the  proposed  repository  at  Yucca 
Mountain.

As  you  know,  the  NRC  staff  has  accepted  for  technical  licensing 
review the application from the Department of Energy to construct 
a geologic repository for high-level waste at Yucca Mountain. 

Spent  nuclear  fuel  can  be  safely  and  securely  transported.  This 
conclusion  is  based  on  over  35  years  of  experience  with  spent  fuel 
transportation  both  here  in  the  United  States  and  around  the 
world. It is also based on the application of a comprehensive regu-
latory  framework  and  effective  oversight  by  the  NRC  working  in 
partnership  with  other  agencies  such  as  the  Department  of  Trans-
portation. 

Within the United States, there have been over 1,500 commercial 
shipments of spent fuel since 1979. All of these shipments have oc-
curred  without  a  single  package  failure  or  a  radiological  release, 
thus  protecting  workers  and  members  of  the  public  that  live  and 
work along the shipment routes. 

The safety and security of spent nuclear fuel shipments are guid-
ed  by  a  comprehensive  regulatory  framework.  NRC’s  primary  role 
is in the review and certification of transportation package designs. 
NRC  would  maintain  this  role  for  spent  fuel  transport  to  the  pro-
posed repository. Spent fuel is required to be shipped in extremely 
robust transportation packages that are designed and fabricated to 
withstand  both  normal  transportation  and  hypothetical  accident 
conditions. 

Now,  rather  than  become  complacent  with  the  existing  safety 
record,  the  NRC  continually  examines  the  transportation  program 
to ensure that our standards provide a high level of safety and se-
curity.  The  Commission  published  transportation  risk  studies  in 
1977, 1987, and again in 2000. These studies indicate that the risk 
of  shipping  spent  nuclear  fuel  is  very  low.  We  are  currently  reex-
amining  the  spent  nuclear  fuel  transportation  risks  that  are  likely 
to  be  encountered  in  potential  shipments  to  the  proposed  reposi-
tory. 

In 2002, the NRC cosponsored an independent safety assessment 
of  spent  fuel  transport  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  enti-
tled  Going  the  Distance.  The  NRC  takes  this  study’s  recommenda-
tions very seriously and has addressed them in the program. 

NAS  recommended  that  full-scale  testing  of  transport  packages 
be  used  as  part  of  an  integrated  approach  along  with  technical 
analysis,  computer  simulation,  scale-model,  and  package  compo-
nent  testing.  The  study’s  recommendations  are  consistent  with 
NRC’s plans to perform a full-scale demonstration test involving re-
alistic rail transport and fire scenarios. 

NAS  recommended  that  the  NRC  undertake  additional  analyses 
of  transportation  accidents  involving  long-duration,  fully  engulfing 
fires. The NRC has completed two such studies on the performance 
of  representative  spent  fuel  packages  in  severe  rail  and  highway 
tunnel  fires  since  the  NAS  made  its  recommendations  and  these 
studies  confirmed  that  the  spent  nuclear  fuel  packages  would  not 
be  expected  to  release  any  radioactive  materials  during  the  fire 
even under severe accident conditions. 

More  studies  are  underway  and  will  be  completed  next  year  in 

Finally,  the  NAS  recommended  an  independent  examination  of 
the  security  of  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  transportation.  In 

2009.

light  of  the  elevated  threat  that  followed  the  terrorist  attacks  on 
September  11,  2001,  the  NRC  conducted  security  assessments  of 
transportation  which  were  completed  after  the  publication  of  the 
NAS  report.  These  assessments  evaluated  transportation  package 
designs  against  a  variety  of  credible  land-based  and  air  threats. 
The  results  of  the  security  assessments  demonstrate  that  the  cur-
rent  requirements,  combined  with  security  enhancements  put  in 
place after September 11, provide adequate safety and security. 

In late 2009, the NRC intends to issue a proposed rule for public 
comment  that  would  revise  the  requirements  for  secure  transport 
of spent nuclear fuel, including additional security measures found 
necessary. 

In  addition,  we  believe  that  security  measures  for  future  ship-
ments  must  defend  against  the  threat  that  exists  at  the  time  of 
that  shipment  and  take  advantage  of  enhancements  in  technology 
which  are  constantly  evolving.  If  the  Yucca  Mountain  repository  is 
approved,  any  shipments  of  spent  fuel  to  this  site  would  not  begin 
until  2020  at  the  earliest  based  on  current  DOE  estimates.  There-
fore,  it  may  be  more  appropriate  to  conduct  such  an  independent 
examination closer to the time of the actual shipments. 

Although  the  NRC  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  security  of 
commercial spent fuel shipments to an interim storage facility, the 
Department would be responsible for implementing and overseeing 
the security of Yucca Mountain shipments because the Department 
plans to take title to the commercial spent fuel at the nuclear reac-
tor  sites.  Therefore,  any  comprehensive  security  assessment  would 
require participation of both the Department and the NRC, as well 
as the resources necessary to support such a study. 

In  conclusion,  spent  fuel  can  be  safely  and  securely  transported, 
including  potential  transportation  under  the  existing  regulatory 
framework.  This  conclusion  is  supported  by  the  outstanding  safety 
and  security  record  for  spent  fuel  shipments  and  numerous  safety 
and  security  assessments  conducted  by  the  NRC  and  others  such 
as  the  National  Academy.  Nevertheless,  NRC  staff  remains  com-
mitted in continually examining our transportation program to en-
sure  safety  and  security  are  achieved  and  that  the  program  re-
mains effective in protecting people and the environment. 

I  want  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you 
today, and I look forward to answering any questions that you may 
have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL WEBER, DIRECTOR, NUCLEAR MATERIAL SAFETY 

AND SAFEGUARDS, U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 

Introduction 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am honored to appear before you 
today  to  testify  on  behalf  of  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  staff 
concerning the NRC’s role in ensuring the safety and security of the potential trans-
portation of spent nuclear fuel, including the potential transport to the proposed ge-
ological repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. As you know, the NRC staff has ac-
cepted  for  technical  review  the  application  from  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE) 
to construct a geologic repository for high-level waste at this site. 

Spent nuclear fuel can be safely and securely transported, including from its cur-
rent location at operating and decommissioned nuclear power plants to a permanent 
geologic  repository.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  over  35  years  of  experience  with 
spent  nuclear  fuel  transportation  both  here  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world.  It  is 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

also based on the application of a comprehensive regulatory framework and effective 
oversight  by  the  NRC,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT),  the  Depart-
ment of Energy (DOE), States, and Tribal governments. Within the U.S., there have 
been  over  1,500  commercial  shipments  of  spent  fuel  from  nuclear  power  reactors 
since  1979.  All  of  these  shipments  have  occurred  without  a  single  package  failure 
or  radiological  release.  This  means  that  there  have  been  no  radiological  releases  or 
injuries  to  workers  or  the  public  who  live  and  work  along  these  shipment  routes. 
It is our understanding that the transportation safety record also extends to the ap-
proximately  30,000  international  spent  fuel  shipments  made  primarily  by  Japanese 
and European companies engaged in the reprocessing of spent fuel. 
Regulatory Framework 

The  safety  and  security  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  shipments  are  guided  by  a  com-
prehensive  regulatory  framework  that  includes  the  NRC,  DOE,  DOT,  the  States, 
and Tribal governments. This regulatory framework is informed and closely aligned 
with  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  Transportation  Safety  Stand-
ard to ensure international alignment of transportation package performance stand-
ards and requirements. The NRC’s primary role in ensuring the safety and security 
of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste shipments is the review and certification 
of  the  package  designs  that  are  to  be  used  for  shipment.  NRC  would  maintain  this 
role  for  the  proposed  high-level  waste  repository.  Spent  fuel  is  required  to  be 
shipped  in  extremely  robust  transportation  packages  that  are  designed  and  fab-
ricated  to  withstand  normal  transportation  and  hypothetical  accident  conditions. 
The  certification  process  requires  a  comprehensive  technical  review  by  the  NRC 
staff  of  the  package’s  expected  performance  under  hypothetical  accident  conditions. 
The specific conditions have been derived from and are intended to envelope the im-
pact forces and thermal environments experienced in severe, ‘‘real world’’ accidents. 
To be certified by the NRC, a vendor must demonstrate that a transportation pack-
age design will prevent the release of radioactive material and the loss of radiation 
shielding when subjected to the hypothetical accident conditions. 

For  commercial  shipments  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  by  NRC  licensees,  the  NRC  also 
approves the Quality Assurance (QA) programs that apply to the design, fabrication, 
use  and  maintenance  of  transportation  packages  and  requires  that  shipments  com-
ply  with  NRC  regulations  for  the  physical  security  of  spent  fuel  in  transit  (10  CFR 
Part  73).  NRC’s  QA  and  security  regulations  do  not  apply  to  DOE’s  shipments  to 
the proposed high-level waste repository. 

In  general,  DOT  regulates  the  transport  of  all  hazardous  materials,  including 
spent nuclear fuel, and has established regulations for shippers and carriers regard-
ing  radiological  controls,  hazard  communication,  training,  emergency  response,  and 
criteria  to  determine  preferred  routes  for  hazardous  material  shipment.  The  states 
and  tribal  governments  bear  primary  responsibility  for  responding  to  accidents  and 
incidents within their jurisdictions and in many cases the states have enacted addi-
tional  requirements  for  carrier  inspections  and  escorts.  For  potential  shipments  to 
the proposed high-level waste repository at Yucca Mountain, the DOE would be re-
sponsible  for  ensuring  the  security  of  the  shipments,  because  DOE  plans  to  take 
title  to  commercial  spent  fuel  at  nuclear  reactor  sites.  Congress  has  also  directed 
DOE to abide by NRC requirements for providing advance notifications of shipments 
to State and local governments. 
NRC’s  Efforts  to  Maintain  Safety  and  Security  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel 

Transportation 

Rather  than  be  complacent  with  existing  safety  performance  of  transportation 
packages, the NRC continually examines the transportation program to ensure that 
our standards provide a high level of safety and security. The Commission published 
transportation risk studies in 1977, 1987, and 2000. These studies indicate that the 
risk  of  shipping  spent  nuclear  fuel  is  very  low.  To  supplement  previous  efforts,  we 
are currently re-examining spent nuclear fuel transportation risks to account for the 
spent  nuclear  fuel,  shipping  cask  and  shipment  characteristics  likely  to  be  encoun-
tered in potential shipments to the proposed geologic repository. 

In 2002, the NRC co-sponsored an independent safety assessment by the National 
Academy of Science’s (NAS’s) Board on Radioactive Waste Management of spent nu-
clear fuel (SNF) and high-level waste (HLW) transportation, entitled Going the Dis-
tance  which  was  published  in  February  2006.  The  NRC  takes  this  study’s  rec-
ommendations very seriously and addressed them in our program. 

The principal finding of the NAS study was: 

The  Committee  could  identify  no  fundamental  technical  barriers  to  the  safe 
transport  of  SNF  and  HLW  in  the  United  States.  Transport  by  highway  (for 
small-quantity  shipments),  and  by  rail  (for  large-quantity  shipments)  is,  from

15 

a  technical  viewpoint,  a  low-radiological-risk  activity,  with  manageable  safety, 
health, and environmental consequences, when conducted with strict adherence 
to existing regulations. 

The  NAS  study  recommended  that  full-scale  testing  continue  to  be  used  as  part 
of an integrated approach, along with technical analysis, computer simulation, scale- 
model,  and  package  component  testing  programs,  to  confirm  that  transportation 
packages perform acceptably under both regulatory and credible conditions that ex-
ceed  regulatory  requirements.  The  study  also  concluded  that  ‘‘deliberate  full-scale 
testing  of  packages  to  destruction  through  the  application  of  forces  that  substan-
tially exceed credible accident conditions would be marginally informative and is not 
justified given the considerable cost for package acquisitions that such testing would 
require.’’  The  study’s  recommendations  are  consistent  with  NRC’s  current  plans  in 
the  Package  Performance  Study  (PPS)  to  perform  a  demonstration  test  involving  a 
realistic rail impact and fire scenarios. We believe that the NAS study also supports 
NRC’s  decision  not  to  test  a  full-scale  transportation  package  to  destruction  in  the 
PPS.  Work  on  the  PPS  has  been  deferred  by  the  NRC  and  DOE  until  the  final 
transportation cask designs, including the transport, aging, and disposal (TAD) can-
isters,  are  deployed.  We  are  currently  working  with  international  counterparts  in 
Japan  and  Germany  to  learn  from  their  full-scale  and  model  testing  to  prepare  for 
full-scale testing in the U.S. 

NAS recommended that NRC undertake additional analyses of transportation ac-
cidents  involving  very  long-duration,  fully  engulfing  fires  to  determine  whether 
there is a need for regulatory change or additional operational controls during spent 
nuclear  fuel  shipments.  The  NRC  has  completed  two  studies  on  the  performance  of 
representative  spent  nuclear  fuel  packages  in  severe  rail  and  highway  tunnel  fires: 
‘‘Spent  Fuel  Transportation  Package  Response  to  the  Baltimore  Tunnel  Fire  Sce-
nario,’’  NUREG/CR–6886  (published  December  2006),  and  ‘‘Spent  Fuel  Transpor-
tation  Package  Response  to  the  Caldecott  Tunnel  Fire  Scenario,’’  NUREG/CR–6894 
(published  February  2007).  These  studies  confirmed  that  the  spent  nuclear  fuel 
packages  would  not  be  expected  to  release  any  radioactive  material  from  the  spent 
fuel, even under these severe accident conditions. 

Through  this  work,  the  NRC  identified  an  additional  operating  control  for  rail 
shipments  that  could  be  implemented  to  prevent  or  mitigate  the  consequences  of 
long-duration  fires:  to  prohibit  a  train  carrying  flammable  gases  or  liquids  from 
being  in  a  tunnel  at  the  same  time  as  a  train  carrying  spent  nuclear  fuel.  Because 
the  NRC  does  not  have  regulatory  authority  over  rail  carriers,  we  requested  in 
March  2006,  that  the  Association  of  American  Railroads  (AAR)  consider  revising 
AAR Circular No. OT–55, Recommended Railroad Operating Practices For Transpor-
tation  of  Hazardous  Materials.  As  a  result,  the  AAR  did  issue  a  revision  in  July 
2006 (AAR Circular No. OT–55, Revision I) which states ‘‘. . . when a train carrying 
SNF or HLW meets another train carrying loaded tank cars of flammable gas, flam-
mable  liquids  or  combustible  liquids  in  a  single  bore  double  track  tunnel,  one  train 
shall stop outside the tunnel until the other train is completely through the tunnel.’’ 
Finally, the NAS study also recommended that, ‘‘. . . an independent examination 
of  the  security  of  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  transportation  should  be  carried 
out  prior  to  the  commencement  of  large-quantity  shipments  to  a  Federal  repository 
or  to  interim  storage.’’  In  light  of  the  elevated  threat  that  the  U.S.  experienced  fol-
lowing  the  terrorist  attacks  on  September  11,  2001,  the  NRC  issued  safeguards 
advisories  and  orders  to  enhance  transportation  security  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  and 
other  large  quantities  of  radioactive  material.  The  NRC  issued  these  security  en-
hancements in coordination with DOT, the Department of Homeland Security, State 
agencies,  and  other  Federal  agencies.  The  NRC  security  assessments  of  transpor-
tation,  which  were  completed  after  the  publication  of  the  NAS  report,  evaluated  a 
number  of  representative  transportation  package  designs  against  a  variety  of  cred-
ible  land-based  threats  and  a  deliberate  plane  crash.  The  results  of  these  security 
assessments,  which  we  have  shared  with  DOT,  DOE,  and  other  organizations  that 
have  a  ‘‘need  to  know,’’  demonstrate  that  the  current  requirements,  combined  with 
the security enhancements put in place after September 11th, provide adequate pro-
tection  of  public  health  and  safety,  and  the  environment,  and  common  defense  and 
security.  These  safeguards  advisories  and  orders  are  only  an  interim  solution  and 
will not be relied on indefinitely. In late 2009, the NRC intends to issue a proposed 
rule  for  public  comment  that  would  revise  the  requirements  for  secure  transport  of 
spent nuclear fuel. The proposed rule would include additional measures to address 
the current threat environment. 

In  addition,  we  believe  that  the  security  measures  for  future  shipments  must  de-
fend  against  the  threat  that  exists  at  the  time  of  shipment  and  take  advantage  of 
enhancements in technology, such as shipment tracking and monitoring techniques,

which  are  constantly  evolving.  If  the  Yucca  Mountain  repository  is  approved,  any 
shipments  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  to  this  site  would  not  begin  until  2020  at  the  ear-
liest,  based  on  current  DOE  estimates.  Therefore,  it  may  be  more  appropriate  to 
conduct  an  independent  examination  of  shipment  security  closer  to  the  time  of  ac-
tual shipments, if needed. 

While  the  NRC  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  security  requirements  for  com-
mercial  shipments  to  an  interim  storage  facility,  DOE  would  be  responsible  for  im-
plementing  and  overseeing  the  security  requirements  for  Yucca  Mountain  ship-
ments.  Therefore,  a  comprehensive  independent  security  assessment  that  encom-
passes  both  potential  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain  or  to  an  interim  storage  site 
would  require  the  participation  of  both  NRC  and  DOE  as  well  as  resources  to  sup-
port such a study. 

In an effort to further inform our program, the NRC is also examining two recent 
transportation accidents involving severe highway fires. One is the MacArthur Maze 
(Interstate  I–880)  accident  in  Oakland,  California  that  occurred  on  April  29,  2007, 
in  which  a  gasoline  tanker  truck  with  a  capacity  of  32,500  liters  (8,600  gallons)  of 
gasoline  crashed  and  overturned  on  an  interstate  highway.  The  resulting  fire  was 
intense  enough  to  cause  the  collapse  of  a  highway  overpass  located  above  the  over-
turned  tanker  truck.  The  second  accident  being  studied  occurred  on  October  12, 
2007,  within  the  southbound  ‘‘truck  only’’  bypass  tunnel  at  the  I–5/14  interchange 
in northern Los Angeles County (Newhall Pass). In this accident, multiple commer-
cial trucks were involved in a severe fire occurring in a short, well-ventilated tunnel. 
We expect the results of these studies to be published in early 2009. 
Summary 

In  conclusion,  spent  nuclear  fuel  can  be  safely  and  securely  transported  from  its 
current  location  at  operating  and  decommissioned  nuclear  power  plants,  including 
potentially to a permanent geologic repository, under the existing regulatory frame-
work.  This  conclusion  is  supported  by  the  outstanding  safety  record  for  spent  nu-
clear  fuel  shipments  to  date  and  numerous  safety  and  security  assessments  con-
ducted  by  the  NRC,  the  NAS,  and  other  agencies.  Nevertheless,  the  NRC  staff  is 
committed to continually examining our transportation safety and security program 
to ensure that it remains effective in protecting people and the environment. 

Thank you for the opportunity to discuss NRC’s transportation safety and security 
program for spent nuclear fuel. I look forward to answering any questions you may 
have. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Director Weber. 
And now may I call upon Director Pritchard? 

STATEMENT OF EDWARD W. PRITCHARD, DIRECTOR, 
OFFICE OF SAFETY ASSURANCE AND COMPLIANCE, 

FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION, 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Mr.  PRITCHARD.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Senator  En-
sign  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  the  oppor-
tunity to appear today on behalf of the Secretary of Transportation, 
Mary  Peters,  and  the  Administrator  of  the  Federal  Railroad  Ad-
ministration,  Joseph  Boardman.  I  am  Edward  Pritchard,  Director 
of FRA’s Office of Safety Assurance and Compliance. 

Part  of  FRA’s  role  in  protecting  the  American  public  from  the 
risk inherent in rail transportation includes promoting the safe and 
secure  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel.  With  the  Department 
of  Energy’s  decision  that  80  percent  or  more  of  the  nuclear  mate-
rials  to  be  stored  at  Yucca  Mountain  should  be  transported  there 
by  rail,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  safety  and  security  of  these 
new  shipments  during  rail  transportation.  FRA’s  role  is  important 
in this regard and we are up to the challenge. 

FRA  has  been  hard  at  work  to  assure  the  safe  transportation  of 
radioactive  materials  since  the  formation  of  the  U.S.  Department 
of  Transportation.  We  formalized  our  program  for  these  shipments 
in  the  late  1980s  and  we  are  taking  steps  to  ensure  the  continued

safety  of  such  shipments  as  they  move  through  the  Nation’s  rail 
transportation  system.  We  do  this  in  two  main  ways,  giving  tech-
nical assistance to other agencies and carrying out our comprehen-
sive safety enforcement and rulemaking program. 

First,  we  provide  technical  expertise  and  assistance  to  other 
agencies. We actively work with our partner agencies, including the 
Department  of  Energy,  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission,  and 
the  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration,  and 
the Transportation Security Administration. Our cooperative efforts 
with  DOE  include  all  rail-related  aspects  before  the  plan  moves  to 
Yucca Mountain. This cooperation includes vigorously participating 
in their external stakeholder working groups and contributing tech-
nical  and  operational  expertise  regarding  the  rail  operating  envi-
ronment,  mechanical  equipment  requirements,  and  track  construc-
tion and maintenance. 

I  am  proud  to  say  that  the  same  degree  of  coordination  exists 
throughout  the  various  modal  administrations  within  the  DOT,  as 
well  as  with  the  NRC  and  TSA,  in  regard  to  issues,  concerns  in-
volving  the  security  of  rail  movements  and  routing,  package  integ-
rity and securement in the rail operating environment. These rela-
tionships  are  strong,  and  together  our  work  is  progressing  to  en-
sure  that  any  shipment  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  transported  to  the 
Yucca  Mountain  repository  by  rail  is  conducted  in  a  way  that 
assures  not  only  the  safety  and  security  of  these  tasks  with  trans-
porting the shipment, but also the safety and security of the Amer-
ican public as a whole. 

Second,  FRA  provides  technical  and  regulatory  oversight  to  en-
sure  that  the  rolling  equipment  and  railroad  infrastructure  used 
for  the  movements  are  safe.  FRA’s  efforts  are  focused  on  ensuring 
the rail cars that will move the casks of spent nuclear fuel are the 
safest  possible  and  utilize  the  most  advanced  technology.  We  have 
developed  and  instituted  a  comprehensive  safety  enforcement  pro-
gram  that  ensures  that  the  tracks  and  other  rail  infrastructures 
conform  with  the  extensive  body  of  Federal  railroad  safety  regula-
tions. 

We  are  working  with  our  sister  agency,  PHMSA,  to  implement 
PHMSA’s new routing regulations that require rail carriers to ana-
lyze potential routes for transporting these shipments and to select 
the most safe and secure routes. 

But  these  efforts  are  not  the  only  ways  in  which  FRA  works  to 
advance  rail  safety.  FRA  and  the  administration  are  strong  sup-
porters of positive train control technology, are active advocates for 
the  continued  development  of  positive  train  control,  and  we  share 
the  desire  of  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  and  Con-
gress  to  see  that  the  positive  train  control  becomes  a  reality  on 
more railroads. 

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss  FRA’s  program  to  assure 
the  safe  and  secure  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  by  rail. 
Thank  you.  I  will  be  pleased  to  answer  any  questions  you  may 
have. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Director Pritchard. 
And  may  now  I  call  upon  Associate  Administrator,  Mr.  Willke?

STATEMENT OF DR. THEODORE ‘‘TED’’ WILLKE, ASSOCIATE 

ADMINISTRATOR, HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY, 

PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY 

ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
Dr. WILLKE. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Senator Ensign. 
I am Ted Willke, Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials 
Safety,  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration, 
PHMSA, the U.S. Department of Transportation. Thank you for the 
opportunity to appear today to briefly discuss PHMSA’s role in the 
safe and secure transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level 
radioactive  waste  to  the  proposed  geological  repository  at  Yucca 
Mountain, Nevada. 

For  some  50  years,  some  1,500  domestic  shipments  of  spent  nu-
clear  fuel  have  been  transported  within  the  United  States  with  a 
solid safety record. It is our firm belief that this fuel can be safely 
and securely transported from its current location at operating and 
decommissioned nuclear power reactors to a permanent repository. 
Our confidence is based on the application of a comprehensive reg-
ulatory  framework  that  includes  DOT,  the  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission,  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  Department  of  Home-
land  Security,  and  State  and  tribal  governments.  We  have  a  com-
mitment  to  continually  reexamine  the  transportation  program  to 
ensure  that  the  current  level  of  safety  and  security  is  maintained. 
Under  the  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act  of  1982,  the  Department  of 
Energy  has  primary  responsibility  to  plan  for  and  arrange  the 
transportation for spent nuclear fuel to a geological repository. The 
act  requires  all  transportation  to  be  conducted  in  accordance  with 
the  transportation  regulations  issued  by  DOT  in  transport  casks 
approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

Within  the  Department  of  Transportation,  several  agencies  are 
involved  in  regulating  the  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel. 
PHMSA  maintains  a  national  program  designed  to  protect  life, 
property, and the environment from risks inherent in the transpor-
tation of hazardous materials in commerce, including spent nuclear 
fuel  and  high-level  radioactive  waste.  To  carry  out  this  role, 
PHMSA identifies and evaluates safety risks, develops and enforces 
standards  for  transporting  hazardous  materials,  educates  shippers 
and  carriers,  investigates  transport  and  packaging  incidents  and 
failures,  conducts  research,  and  awards  grants  to  improve  emer-
gency response to incidents. 

PHMSA’s regulations, issued under the Federal hazardous mate-
rials  transportation  safety 
laws,  establish  commodity-specific 
standards  for  the  classification,  packaging,  marking,  labeling,  and 
documentation  of  hazardous  material  shipments  by  rail,  highway, 
vessel,  and  air.  PHMSA’s  hazardous  regulations  also  prescribe 
standards  for  the  loading  and  unloading  of  transport  conveyances, 
training of transportation employees, and the security of hazardous 
materials in transportation. 

While  PHMSA  is  proud  of  its  contributions  to  the  safe  transpor-
tation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel,  the  true  strength  of  this  program  lies 
in  the  shared  responsibility  and  cooperation  between  our  Federal, 
State,  and  local  partners.  Within  the  Department  of  Transpor-
tation,  responsibility  for  enforcement  of  the  hazardous  material 
regulations is shared with the Federal Railroad Administration and

19 

the  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Administration.  We  also  share 
enforcement  responsibilities  with  the  United  States  Coast  Guard 
and  State  law  enforcement  officials.  For  all  radioactive  shipments, 
particularly spent nuclear fuel, PHMSA works closely with the Nu-
clear  Regulatory  Commission  to  ensure  consistent  and  uniform 
packaging and transport regulations. 

Because  our  State  partners  have  the  primary  responsibility  for 
responding  to  accidents  and  incidents  within  their  jurisdiction, 
PHMSA  will  continue  to  support  effective  training  to  prepare  first 
responders for a possible transportation accident or incident involv-
ing  spent  nuclear  fuel  through  their  jurisdictions  and  that  will  in-
clude financial assistance to states and localities for emergency re-
sponse,  planning  and  training.  PHMSA  will  continue  to  coordinate 
with  local  responders  and  ensure  that  they  receive  the  advance 
shipment  notifications  and  general  hazard  communications  they 
need to respond to transport incidents. 

As  planning  for  the  repository  progresses,  PHMSA  will  continue 
to  work  with  the  Congress,  the  nuclear  industry,  the  transport 
community,  and  appropriate  Federal,  State,  tribal  governments, 
and local agencies to review and improve existing safety standards, 
promote  the  development  of  risk-reducing  technologies,  strengthen 
the  preparation  of  emergency  responders  and  otherwise  enhance 
the  system  of  safety  controls  for  spent  nuclear  fuel  transportation. 
With continued vigilance, PHMSA is committed to maintaining the 
strong record of safety and security. 

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  discuss  PHMSA’s  transportation 
safety  and  security  program.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any 
questions.

Introduction 

Chairman  Inouye,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison,  and  Members  of  the  Committee, 
we  want  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  today  on  behalf  of  the  Depart-
ment of Transportation (DOT). We are pleased to discuss DOT’s role in the safe and 
secure  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  (SNF)  and  high-level  radioactive  waste 
(HLRW) to the proposed geological repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. 
The Safety Record 

SNF  and  HLRW  have  been  transported  within  the  United  States  for  more  than 
50  years,  with  a  solid  record  of  safety  and  security.  More  than  1,500  shipments  of 
commercial  SNF  from  nuclear  power  reactors  have  moved  by  road  and  rail  without 
a  single  incident  resulting  in  an  injury,  death,  or  release  of  the  material  from  the 
packaging.  Likewise,  numerous  military  shipments  of  SNF;  thousands  of  non-com-
mercial  spent  fuel  and  HLRW  shipments  by  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE);  and 
approximately 30,000 international shipments of SNF have occurred without serious 
incident. 
Regulatory Roles 

Under  the  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act  of  1982,  DOE  has  primary  responsibility  to 
plan  for  and  arrange  the  transportation  of  SNF  to  a  geological  repository.  The  Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is responsible for licensing the geological repos-
itory  and  whatever  interim  facilities  may  be  needed.  Transportation  will  be  con-
ducted,  in  accordance  with  hazardous  materials  transport  regulations  issued  by 
DOT,  in  transport  casks  approved  by  the  NRC.  States  will  bear  primary  responsi-
bility  for  responding  to  accidents  and  incidents  within  their  jurisdictions  and  in

many  cases  have  enacted  additional  requirements  for  carrier  inspections  and  es-
corts.  DOE,  DOT,  and  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  have  provided 
grants,  courses,  and  course  materials  for  emergency  responder  training  and  pre-
paredness  related  to  this  transportation.  Because  DOE  plans  to  take  title  to  the 
SNF  at  nuclear  reactor  sites,  that  department  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the 
security of the shipments. 
DOT Role in Promoting Transportation Safety 

Within  DOT,  several  agencies  are  involved  in  overseeing  the  transportation  of 
SNF.  The  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration  (PHMSA)  ad-
ministers a national program designed to protect life, property, and the environment 
from risks inherent in the transportation of hazardous materials, including SNF, in 
intrastate and interstate commerce. To these ends, PHMSA identifies and evaluates 
safety  risks;  develops  and  enforces  standards  for  transporting  hazardous  materials; 
educates  shippers  and  carriers;  investigates  transport  and  packaging  incidents  and 
failures; conducts research; and awards grants to improve emergency response to in-
cidents.  PHMSA  regulations,  issued  under  the  Federal  hazardous  materials  trans-
portation  safety  laws  (49  U.S.C.  ch.  51),  establish  commodity-specific  standards  for 
the  classification,  packaging,  marking,  labeling,  and  documentation  of  hazardous 
materials  shipments  by  rail,  highway,  vessel,  and  air.  PHMSA’s  Hazardous  Mate-
rials  Regulations  (HMR)  also  prescribe  standards  for  the  loading  and  unloading  of 
transport  conveyances;  training  of  transportation  employees;  and  security  of  haz-
ardous materials in transportation. 

PHMSA  shares  responsibility  for  enforcement  of  the  HMR  with  the  Federal  Rail-
road  Administration  (FRA),  the  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Administration 
(FMCSA), the United States Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration, and 
state law enforcement officials. 

For shipments of SNF, PHMSA also works closely with the NRC. PHMSA’s regu-
lations  incorporate  rigorous  packaging  standards  that  are  developed  and  overseen 
by the NRC. Pursuant to a 1979 Memorandum of Understanding, with PHMSA, the 
NRC  has  lead  regulatory  responsibility  for  the  review  and  certification  of  the  ship-
ping  casks  used  to  transport  SNF.  These  casks  are  performance-tested  to  assure 
they can survive ‘‘hypothetical’’ accident scenarios. The tests, which include impact, 
puncture,  thermal  and  immersion  testing,  also  assure  that  the  casks  provide  excel-
lent  radiation  protection  to  transportation  workers  who  load,  unload,  or  carry  SNF 
and to any member of the general public who may come into proximity with a ship-
ment  of  nuclear  material  during  its  movement  in  transportation.  Because  the  time 
that it takes to move a shipment from origin to destination directly affects radiation 
exposure,  the  NRC  requires  that  shipments  of  SNF  be  planned  to  avoid  inter-
mediate stops to the extent practicable. PHMSA’s regulations also prohibit unneces-
sary delay in the transportation of hazardous materials. 

FRA  enforces  the  HMR  applicable  to  rail  shipments  as  part  of  a  national  safety 
program  covering  all  aspects  of  railroad  operations.  FRA  regulations  issued  under 
the Federal railroad safety laws (49 U.S.C. ch. 201–213) govern the design, mainte-
nance,  and  inspection  of  track,  equipment,  signals,  and  train  control  systems  and 
prescribe  standards  for  employee  qualifications,  training,  and  operating  practices. 
FRA  also  advises  PHMSA  on  rulemakings  involving  the  rail  transportation  of  haz-
ardous  material  and  enforces  the  HMR  in  the  rail  mode.  Railroads  are  required  to 
conduct  their  own  inspections  to  ensure  that  these  safety  standards  are  being  met. 
Approximately 500 Federal and State safety inspectors monitor the railroad compa-
nies’  own  inspection  forces  to  verify  compliance  with  applicable  Federal  safety 
standards. FRA and State inspectors accomplish this task by conducting routine in-
spections and programmed focused inspections of railroad properties and comparing 
their  findings  to  a  railroad’s  own  inspection  records,  as  well  as  conducting  compli-
ance  investigations.  Thus,  while  primary  responsibility  for  inspecting  the  railroad 
property and operations rests with the railroads themselves, FRA’s inspection strat-
egy is to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the railroads’ own inspection pro-
grams in complying with applicable Federal safety regulations and standards. In the 
case  of  SNF  shipments,  as  set  forth  in  the  following  section,  FRA  and  rail  carriers 
have  taken  a  number  of  actions  to  further  strengthen  safety  and  security  controls. 
Although  rail  will  be  the  primary  mode  of  transportation  for  SNF  shipments  to 
the repository, some motor carrier movements also will be necessary. In addition to 
the  HMR,  these  movements  will  in  accordance  with  FMCSA  regulations  governing 
vehicle  condition,  driver  safety,  and  security.  Under  FMCSA’s  regulations,  a  motor 
carrier  transporting  SNF  must  hold  a  safety  permit  issued  by  FMCSA,  and  a  pre- 
trip  inspection  of  the  shipment  must  be  performed  by  an  authorized  State  or  Fed-
eral law enforcement official. In addition, states may designate preferred routes for 
highway  shipments  of  SNF,  in  accordance  with  FMCSA’s  regulations.  Preferred

21 

routes  are  interstate  highways  and  alternate  routes  designated  by  a  State  routing 
agency. An interstate bypass or beltway around a city, when available, must be used 
rather  than  an  interstate  route  through  a  city.  Under  these  regulations,  a  State  or 
locality may not designate (or restrict the use of) routes that ‘‘export’’ transportation 
risks to a neighboring jurisdiction or unnecessarily delay the transportation of haz-
ardous materials. 
Emergency Response 

Effective  response  to  a  transportation  accident  or  incident  involving  SNF  is  en-
hanced  through  Federal  requirements  and  resources,  including  financial  assistance 
to  states  and  localities  for  emergency  response  planning  and  training.  DOE  main-
tains  regional  emergency  management  field  offices  that  can  dispatch  qualified  re-
sponse teams to an incident involving nuclear material, but first responders are pri-
marily local fire departments and law enforcement agencies. (In the event of a radi-
ation  emergency,  emergency  response  is  typically  handled  by  the  appropriate  state 
radiation  control  agency  and  first  responders  are  trained  to  stay  clear  and  call  the 
state radiation control officer.) PHMSA’s hazard communication requirements (ship-
ping papers, package marking and labeling, and vehicle placarding) inform these re-
sponders of the hazards involved. For shipments of SNF, coordination with local re-
sponders  is  also  enhanced  by  the  NRC’s  physical  protection  requirements  that  pro-
vide  for  advance  notification  to  the  State  Governor  (or  his  representative)  of  each 
shipment to or through the state and advance arrangements with local law enforce-
ment agencies for response to an emergency or a call by escorts for assistance. Local 
emergency  response  capabilities  are  strengthened  by  PHMSA’s  planning  and  train-
ing  grants  to  States,  who  in  turn  pass  at  least  75  percent  of  the  grants  through  to 
local communities. 
Rail Transportation of Radioactive Materials 

With regard to rail transportation of SNF and HLRW in particular, FRA conducts 
inspections  to  verify  that  shipments  are  properly  prepared  for  rail  transportation 
and in compliance with all applicable provisions of the HMR. FRA also helps to en-
sure  that  the  track,  signal  systems,  grade  crossings,  bridges,  and  rail  vehicles  used 
for  these  shipments  are  in  safe  condition  and  that  responsible  railroad  employees 
involved  in  these  movements  are  trained,  briefed,  and  properly  performing  their 
jobs. In these activities, FRA works very closely with the railroads, their employees, 
and  the  affected  communities.  Ultimately,  the  safe  movement  of  SNF  and  HLRW 
depends  on  the  application  of  sound  safety  regulations,  policies,  and  procedures. 
This  requires  extensive  planning  and  coordination  among  Federal  agencies,  State 
and local governments, and commercial transportation companies. 

Since  the  mid-1980s,  FRA  has  implemented  a  basic  focused  inspection  policy  for 
all known rail shipments of SNF and HLRW. In 1998, with the advent of a signifi-
cant  potential  for  increased  SNF  and  HLRW  by  rail,  FRA  recognized  the  need  to 
enhance the existing policy to ensure that the railroad industry’s outstanding safety 
record for nuclear material shipments could continue unabated. This updated policy, 
the  Safety  Compliance  Oversight  Plan  for  Rail  Transportation  of  High-Level  Radio-
active  Waste  and  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel,  known  as  SCOP,  set  forth  an  enhanced  FRA 
policy  to  address  the  safety  of  rail  shipments  of  SNF  and  HLRW.  FRA  applies  this 
enhanced policy to ensure the safety of all known rail shipments of SNF and HLRW. 
The  SCOP  is  a  ‘‘living  document’’  periodically  requiring  modification  and  update  as 
needed based on new regulations, technologies, and procedures. 

The development of the SCOP involved a coordinated effort among FRA, DOE, the 
Association  of  American  Railroads  (AAR),  railroad  labor  organizations,  and  rep-
resentatives of affected states and Native American groups, and FRA acknowledges 
the  invaluable  contribution  of  each  of  them.  Key  elements  of  the  SCOP  include  the 
following:  (1)  coordinated  planning  for  selecting  the  most  appropriate  and  viable 
routes,  (2)  ensuring  appropriate  training  of  railroad  employees  and  emergency  re-
sponders,  and  (3)  enhancing  and  focusing  FRA’s  safety  inspections  and  monitoring 
activities on all facets of the rail shipments of SNF and HLRW. 

Under current route-selection requirements, FRA works with DOE, utility compa-
nies, or other shippers, and the involved railroad companies in planning and select-
ing  the  routes,  emphasizing  the  selection  of  the  highest  classes  of  track.  (Under 
FRA’s  regulations,  each  higher  class  of  track  has  a  greater  permissible  operating 
speed  and  more  stringent  safety  standards.)  Additional  requirements  for  selecting 
the safest and most secure routes for transporting SNF and other high-hazards ma-
terials were also adopted in PHMSA’s interim final rule, ‘‘Enhancing Rail Transpor-
tation  Safety  and  Security  for  Hazardous  Materials  Shipments,’’  published  on 
April 16,  2008.  Under  these  requirements,  a  rail  carrier  must  analyze  the  routes 
over  which  these  materials  may  be  transported  and,  based  on  that  analysis,  select 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

22 

the  safest  and  most  secure  route  to  be  used.  The  Transportation  Security  Adminis-
tration  (TSA)  is  also  engaged  in  a  rulemaking  that  includes  proposals  to  enhance 
the security of rail shipments of certain hazardous materials, including SNF, by re-
quiring carriers to designate a security coordinator, report security concerns to TSA, 
establish a chain of custody for shipments, and advise TSA of the location and other 
specific information regarding shipments within 1 hour of a request from TSA. 

FRA also coordinates with Operation Lifesaver, Inc., a private safety organization, 
to  increase  grade  crossing  safety  awareness  and  education  in  communities  along 
routes. FRA works with appropriate agencies of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity,  the  NRC,  and  DOT’s  Office  of  Intelligence  and  Security  in  identifying  security 
issues and measures. FRA assists with coordination among the shipper, Federal and 
local  law  enforcement  representatives,  and  intelligence  communities  on  security 
matters.  Finally,  FRA  reviews  the  security  and  emergency  response  plans  of  the 
shipper  and  the  rail  carrier  to  ensure  that  they  adequately  address  the  transpor-
tation  security  risks  and  the  actions  to  be  taken  along  the  route  in  the  unlikely 
event of an accident or incident. 

Another  important  element  of  the  SCOP  is  training.  It  is  FRA’s  policy  to  assist 
DOE  and  other  shippers  in  the  development  of  emergency  response  training  and 
safety  briefings  and  to  monitor  the  rail  carrier  and  the  shipper  to  verify  that  req-
uisite training and briefings have been performed. FRA also conducts reviews to en-
sure  that  train  crews  who  operate  the  trains  in  which  nuclear  materials  are  trans-
ported  are  properly  certified,  trained,  and  experienced  in  running  over  the  routes. 
Finally,  FRA  checks  to  see  that  these  crews  have  received  specific  training  con-
cerning the nature of the shipments. 

Federal  regulations  for  shipment  of  nuclear  material  by  rail  are  augmented  by  a 
series  of  safety  and  security  protocols  and  special  operating  restrictions  that  have 
been agreed upon by DOE and the railroads. These protocols and operating restric-
tions,  AAR  Circular  OT–55–I,  Recommended  Railroad  Operating  Practices  for 
Transportation  of  Hazardous  Materials  and  AAR  Standard  S–2043,  Performance 
Specification  for  Trains  Used  to  Carry  High-Level  Radioactive  Material,  for  exam-
ple,  have  evolved  over  the  years  and  are  often  tailored  to  the  particular  needs  of 
these  types  of  shipments.  Under  these  protocols,  a  train  carrying  SNF  or  HLRW 
would  typically  include  the  cask  cars,  at  least  two  buffer  cars,  and  an  escort  car. 
One buffer car is before and one is after the cask cars; the buffer cars are required 
by  regulation  and  not  only  provide  separation  from  the  occupied  locomotive  and 
from the escort car but also act as a cushion against direct impacts on the cask cars 
in the event of a collision. The escort car would be staffed with appropriate nuclear 
safety  and  security  personnel.  Special  operating  restrictions  have  included  limita-
tions  on  the  maximum  speed  of  trains  carrying  nuclear  materials,  requirements  to 
stop  opposing  trains  on  adjacent  tracks  when  they  meet  a  train  carrying  nuclear 
materials,  and  requirements  that  cars  carrying  nuclear  material  be  switched  only 
with an attached locomotive rather than allowing them to roll to a stop on their own 
during switching. 

Another  convention  involving  the  shipment  of  SNF  and  HLRW  by  rail  concerns 
the use of dedicated trains. Until the mid-1970s, most rail shipments of these radio-
active  materials  were  handled  in  regular  service  trains  that  carried  a  wide  variety 
of  other  freight  in  addition  to  radioactive  materials.  However,  in  1974,  the  railroad 
industry  adopted  a  strong  position  that  radioactive  materials  shipments  should 
move in dedicated trains that transport only the radioactive material. Under a con-
gressional mandate, FRA engaged the services of the John A. Volpe National Trans-
portation Systems Center to conduct a thorough study of the safety implications sur-
rounding  the  transportation  of  SNF  and  HLRW  in  dedicated  trains  versus  regular 
service  trains.  In  September  2005,  FRA  transmitted  its  March  2005  report  con-
taining  the  study’s  results  to  the  Congress,  ‘‘Use  of  Dedicated  Trains  for  Transpor-
tation  of  High-Level  Radioactive  Waste  and  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel.’’  The  report  con-
cluded that dedicated train service offers the lowest accident probability and can re-
duce radiation exposure in the event of an accident by mitigating the consequences 
and  simplifying  wreck  clearance.  The  report  also  stated  that  additional  research  is 
needed  to  fully  assess  the  costs  and  risks  of  transporting  SNF.  The  Department  is 
conducting  additional  research  to  assess  conditions  for  the  transportation  of  SNF 
and expects to issue a responsive notice of proposed rulemaking in Fiscal Year 2009. 
The  security  of  rail  shipments  of  radioactive  materials  has  long  been  a  priority 
even before the tragic events of September 11. Some of the protocols described above 
contain  stringent  security  measures  to  protect  against  terrorist  threats,  including 
the accompaniment of these shipments by armed security forces, direct liaison with 
State  and  local  law  enforcement  and  first  responders,  and  requirements  to  protect 
the cars when sitting in rail yards or sidings.

Conclusion 

Through its comprehensive safety programs, and key partnerships with other Fed-
eral,  State,  and  local  authorities,  DOT  is  prepared  for  the  additional  shipments  of 
high-level radioactive materials associated with the opening of a proposed new geo-
logical repository for SNF. As planning for the repository progresses, DOT will con-
tinue  to  work  with  the  Congress,  the  nuclear  industry,  the  transport  community, 
and  appropriate  Federal,  State,  and  local  agencies  to  review  and  improve  existing 
safety  standards;  promote  the  development  of  new  risk-reducing  technologies; 
strengthen  the  preparation  of  emergency  responders;  and  otherwise  enhance  the 
system  of  safety  controls  for  SNF  and  HLRW  transportation.  With  continued  vigi-
lance, DOT is committed to maintaining the strong record of safety and security es-
tablished over the last 50 years. 

We appreciate the opportunity to discuss DOT’s transportation safety and security 
program  for  SNF.  Thank  you.  We  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any  questions  you 
may have. 

The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, Secretary Willke. 
Circumstances  require  my  absence  here.  I  have  another  assign-
ment, and the chair will be relinquished to Senator Ensign. But be-
fore  I  go,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  of  you  for  participating  in  this 
hearing. 

I  would  like  to  just  note  something.  I  know  that  all  of  you  have 
testified  that  the  transport  of  hazardous  material,  especially  spent 
fuel, is safe under the present technology. But yet, you have noted 
that there have been accidents but no leakage. And one of the wit-
nesses compared spent fuel with chlorine. But I recall that chlorine 
is  poisonous,  but  I  do  not  think  it  lasts  for  a  thousand  years.  On 
the  other  hand,  spent  radioactive  fuel  as  a  dangerous  element  in 
that  would  live  for  thousands  of  years.  And  if  you  can  get  into  an 
accident,  some  day  it  may  leak.  So  I  just  want  to  make  that  nota-
tion. 

Mr. Chairman? 
Senator  ENSIGN [presiding].  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  just 

have a few questions for the panel. 

Mr.  Sproat,  if  you  could  answer  the  question  on  transportation 
timing. When is the earliest that DOE could—not when you expect 
when  they  will  but  when  is  the  earliest  that  you  actually  could 
start shipping waste to Yucca Mountain? 

Mr. SPROAT. Senator, in order for us to be able to accept the nu-
clear waste and begin shipment, we would need a license from the 
Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  to  receive  and  possess  that  nu-
clear  fuel  whether  it  is  at  Yucca  Mountain  or  some  other  interim 
storage site. The earliest, if everything went right and the funding 
was not an issue, which we both know is an issue with Yucca, that 
could be would be 2020. How long the licensing proceeding is going 
to last, what the outcome of the licensing proceeding is going to be 
remains  to  be  seen,  but  the  earliest  would  be  2020.  So  really  it  is 
12 years in the future. 

Senator ENSIGN. You could not ship it earlier? 
Mr. SPROAT. No, Senator, we cannot because we need that license 
to  receive  and  possess,  to  be  able  to  take  it.  And  not  only  the  li-
cense from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but by the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act, the repository needs to have a license to operate 
in order for us to accept the fuel and take title to it by the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act. 

Senator ENSIGN. I thought that DOE was going to accept title to 

the waste beforehand while it was still at the sites.

Mr. SPROAT. As of right now, we are not able to do that. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  Does  there  have  to  be  a  change  in  the  law  for 

you to do that? 

Mr. SPROAT. Yes, sir. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  It  was  mentioned  9/11,  and  Mr.  Weber,  I  think 
you  were  the  one  who  kind  of  mentioned  9/11.  That  day  when  we 
were  watching  those  buildings  go  down  and  a  lot  of  engineers 
around  the  country  were  watching  those  buildings  go  down  and 
certainly  people  who  had  designed  those  buildings  never—you 
know,  they  thought  about  earthquakes.  They  thought  about  a  lot 
of  things,  but  when  people  were  watching  those  things,  very  few 
people  I  think  understood  that  those  buildings  could  actually  col-
lapse. 

Have  those  types  of  extreme  circumstances—you  know,  the  fire 
was  much  more  intense  where  it  melted  the  metal.  Have  those 
kind  of  extreme  circumstances  been  taken  into  account?  For  in-
stance,  you  mentioned  air  attacks.  Have  those  kind  of  really  ex-
treme  circumstances,  however  unlikely,  still  possible,  been  taken 
into  account  studying  the  potential  casks  and  being  able  to  trans-
port these containers? 

Mr.  WEBER.  Yes,  sir,  they  have.  9/11—that  night  I  spent  in  our 
emergency  operations  center.  So  I  watched  the  replay  of  the  video 
over and over and over again. 

But  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  security  is  not  something 
that we discovered after 9/11. We have been putting these packages 
through their paces well before 9/11. When NRC was created, safe-
guards  and  security  was  a  big  deal  with  the  American  public,  and 
that is why my office, in part, was created. So well before 9/11, we 
have been conducting destructive experiments. We have been doing 
computer simulations. We have been doing modeling. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  Have  you  done  actually—instead  of  just  com-
puter modeling, have you done actual to where you have gotten the 
temperatures  up  for  potential—what  we  just  talked  about,  a  plane 
crash coming in, jet fuel burning, train crashes where you can have 
some  different  types  of  fuels  burning  at  extreme  temperatures  for 
long  periods  of  time?  Have  you  actually  done  that  not  just  with 
computer  models,  but  with  life-sized  models  of  what  the  transpor-
tation containers would be? 

Mr.  WEBER.  Not  for  the  spent  fuel  containers,  the  packages  that 
are currently being planned for use. We have done it for other type 
B packages and it has been tested overseas by other countries. Ger-
many, for example, has done full-scale testing. 

One  of  our  standard  tests  that  the  packages  have  to  withstand 
a  test  involving  a  pool  of  aviation  fuel  that  is  burned  for  a  pro-
longed  period  of  time,  and  the  package  has  to  withstand  that  kind 
of extreme test in order to meet our requirements. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  If  you  could  give  me  just  a  documentation  on 
what  those  temperatures  reach,  the  type  of  materials,  and  how 
long  they  were  required  to  do  that  for  the  record,  I  would  very 
much appreciate that. 

Mr.  WEBER.  If  I  could,  Senator,  this  requirement  that  is  in  our 
regulations is for 1475 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 30 minutes. 
That  is  our  standard  fire  test  that  the  package  has  to  withstand. 

Now, since then we have been proactive——

Senator  ENSIGN.  I  was  going  go  to  say  some  of  these  fires  are 

going to last a lot longer than 30 minutes. 

Mr.  WEBER.  Oh,  yes.  And  since  then  we  have  been  proactive  in 
reaching out around the country, as we see additional extreme acci-
dents not involving radioactive material, but we use those incidents 
to understand the physics, the mechanics, what actually occurs be-
cause  our  objective  is  to  reconfirm  the  safety  of  the  transportation 
packages. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  You  mentioned  Germany.  Has  Germany  done 
those—you  said  they  have  done  those  studies.  Have  theirs  just 
been  for  30-minute  fires?  You  said  they  have  done  full-scale.  Can 
you get the information on what Germany’s studies have shown so 
that we can see the parameters? 

Mr. WEBER. Certainly. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  OK.  I  appreciate  that  and  we  will  do  that  for 

the record as well. 

[The information referred to is retained in Committee files.] 
Senator  ENSIGN.  Mr.  Willke,  if  you  could  answer,  how  prepared 
are  states  today  to  deal  with  the  thousands  of  rail  and  truck  ship-
ments  of  nuclear  waste?  How  prepared  are  the  states  today?  And 
what  additional  steps  must  be  taken  to  make  sure  that  their  first 
responders,  their  emergency  responders,  are  prepared  to  deal  with 
a potential accident involving a radioactive release? 

Dr.  WILLKE.  Senator,  that  is  a  difficult  question  because  of  the 
1.2  million  fire  fighters  in  this  country  who  do  the  primary  re-
sponse to accidents for hazardous materials, about 800,000 are vol-
unteers, and many of these folks will go through their entire career 
without ever seeing a hazardous material accident. 

We  do  our  best  to  provide  training  for  emergency  responders,  to 
fire fighters. We provide grants to states and tribal governments to 
allow for community planning for hazardous material accidents and 
to  do  training  of  their  local  fire  fighters.  We  also  work  with  every 
fire  service  organization,  national  organization,  to  provide  training 
for fire fighters. We work closely with our multiple partners. 

But  it  is  also  true  it  is  very  difficult  to  plan  for  the  full  range 
of hazardous material incidents that could occur, and we are lucky 
that  we  have  not  seen  an  incident  that  required  that  kind  of  re-
sponse in the transportation of spent nuclear fuel. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  As  part  of  the  transportation  to  a  facility,  are 
we  requiring  states  to  have  certain  types—at  least  certain  teams 
trained to be able to respond? And if so, where is that training? 

Dr.  WILLKE.  I  cannot  speak  for  the  training  that  might  be  re-

quired. 

be required? 

Senator ENSIGN. I guess, should it be? In your opinion, should it 

Dr.  WILLKE.  There  should  be  planning  for  hazardous  materials 
incidents. We believe that all fire fighters should receive that kind 
of training. We are doing everything that we can to get—— 

Senator ENSIGN. Should it be specific to nuclear materials? 
Dr.  WILLKE.  To  the  extent  that  materials  are  flowing  through 
those  communities,  yes,  Senator,  I  believe  that  there  should  be 
training. 

Mr. SPROAT. Senator, if I can just add. 
Senator ENSIGN. Yes.

Mr. SPROAT. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, there is a sec-
tion  called  180(c)  which  requires  the  Federal  Government  to  pro-
vide  grants  to  State,  local,  county  governments  and  first  respond-
ers,  including  Indian  tribes,  specifically  to  provide  the  training  for 
responding to radiological accidents during the transportation cam-
paign. 

Senator ENSIGN. Do you know when that is going to happen? 
Mr. SPROAT. Well, as a matter of fact, we just recently put out— 
yes,  we  are  about  revise  and  put  out  a  Federal  Register  notice  on 
the process for applying for the 180(c) grants. And we have laid out 
a schedule of when that is to start based on the 2020 start of ship-
ment  date,  and  that  training  would  start  a  minimum  of,  I  believe, 
6  years—5  years  prior  to  the  start  of  the  first  shipment.  So  that 
is in our overall game plan, but we are talking about—— 

Senator  ENSIGN.  Is  there  going  to  be  some  kind  of  certification 
process? In other words, OK, you provide a grant, you provide some 
training,  how  do  we  know  that  they  are  adequately  trained?  Is 
there  some  kind  of  a  measuring  process?  I  think  that  most  police 
forces, most fire fighters are trained to meet a certain standard and 
they are certified at the end of it. Is there going to be a certification 
process  that,  yes,  this  fire  fighter  has  been  certified,  this  first  re-
sponder  has  been  certified  to  be  able  to  respond  to  a  potential  nu-
clear accident like this? 

Mr. SPROAT. I am not sure whether or not there will be a—— 
Senator ENSIGN. Can you get that answer for me for the record? 
Mr. SPROAT. Can I take that question for the record, please? 
[The information referred to follows:] 
The  local  emergency  response  employer  is  the  entity  that  will  determine  the  ap-
propriate  level  of  training  for  their  local  responders  and  will  determine  the  certi-
fying  process.  While  the  Department  of  Energy  will  provide  funding  for  training, 
State  and  Tribal  governments  will  have  flexibility  to  decide  those  activities  for 
which  they  will  request  financial  assistance  under  Section  180(c)  of  the  Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act. 

Senator ENSIGN. Please do. 
I want to ask my colleague if he has any questions for this panel. 

STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE 

Senator CARPER. Thank you, sir. Is it Mr. Chairman? 
Senator ENSIGN. It is right now. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  CARPER.  I  know  you  are  Mr.  Chairman  in  one  regard.  I 

was not sure if you had taken over fiefdoms or not. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  You  can  have  that  other  Mr.  Chairman  job  if 

you want it. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  CARPER.  I  think  the  people  in  your  caucus  would  think 
it is strange for me to become their Chairman. Well, I am a bipar-
tisan guy, but that is probably stretching it a little bit. 

To  our  panel,  thank  you  for  joining  us  today.  I  just  have  one  or 

two short questions, if I could. 

The  safe  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  depends  on  the 
interaction  between  a  number  of  folks,  but  particularly  the  three 
agencies  that  we  have  here  today,  DOE,  and  the  Department  of 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

27 

Transportation, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. You may 
have  already  discussed  this  before  I  got  here,  but  just  give  me  an 
idea how your agencies are interacting with one another. 

Mr.  SPROAT.  If  I  can  take  a  first  cut  at  that,  Senator,  the  rela-
tionship between the Department of Energy and DOT and NRC in 
the transportation realm—essentially the Department of Transpor-
tation  has  responsibility  for  setting  the  regulations  for  the  safe 
transport  on  the  rails  and  highways  of  hazardous  waste.  The  Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to set the regu-
lations for the containers, the radioactive material containers, that 
we will use, design, certify, and buy to ship spent nuclear fuel and 
radioactive  waste.  So  in  that  sense,  they  are  our  regulators  in 
terms of setting the regulations that we have to meet for rail ship-
ments, truck shipments, and the NRC sets the regulations that we 
need  to  meet  for  the  containers  in  which  we  will  ship  the  radio-
active materials. That is probably a very quick, simple answer. 

Senator CARPER. OK, thanks. 
Mr.  WEBER.  I  would  add  on  NRC’s  behalf  that  certainly  we  are 
in  a  regulator  mode  with  the  Department  of  Energy  now  that  we 
have  accepted  the  Yucca  Mountain  license  application.  So  it  is  an 
arm’s  length  relationship,  but  I  think  it  is  a  constructive  relation-
ship  and  we  will  see,  as  we  enter  into  the  licensing  review  and 
begin  sending  our  requests  for  additional  information  to  the  De-
partment of Energy as part of our licensing review. 

With  respect  to  our  co-regulators,  the  Department  of  Transpor-
tation, I have never seen such close coordination between an agen-
cy and a Department. When my staff have questions, they are fre-
quently on the phone with the Department of Transportation staff. 
These  people  represent  the  United  States  of  America  on  inter-
national  standards  committees.  They  are  respected  around  the 
world  for  their  expertise  in  transportation  safety  and  security.  So 
I  cannot  describe  for  you  how  positive  the  relationship  is  between 
the agencies. 

Dr.  WILLKE.  Mr.  Chairman,  PHMSA  and  the  Department  of 
Transportation  work  very,  very  closely  with  other  agencies. 
PHMSA  sets  the  packaging  standards  for  shipments  of  all  haz-
ardous  materials.  In  this  case,  we  depend  upon  the  Nuclear  Regu-
latory Commission to set the design standards and the performance 
qualifications for those shipping containers. 

We  also  work  within  the  Department  of  Transportation.  While 
we  set  the  rules  within  PHMSA  for  all  hazardous  material  trans-
portation, enforcement responsibilities are shared with the Federal 
Railroad  Administration,  the  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Admin-
istration,  the  United  States  Coast  Guard,  and  the  Nuclear  Regu-
latory Commission. 

We  have  a  national  program  to  ensure  the  protection  from  all 
hazardous  materials.  We  also  coordinate  internationally.  We  work 
closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency on the estab-
lishment of standards across the world. 

Senator  CARPER.  Mr.  Pritchard,  I  am  not  sure  what  the  deal  is, 
if  you  are  just  to  be  here  for  looks  or  if  you  respond  to  questions 
or  what.  But  I  noticed  they  skipped  right  over  you.  I  do  not  know 
if you are offended by that.

Mr.  PRITCHARD.  Well,  we  are  joined  at  the  hip,  sir.  We  are  both 
with  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  just  to  show  you  the 
cooperativeness that we have together. 

Senator  CARPER.  When  he  spoke,  I  could  barely  see  your  lips

That was a pretty positive response, but are there any ways that 

you all think the cooperation could be facilitated or enhanced?

this? 

Mr. PRITCHARD. I think I will answer that, sir. No. We are really 
joined  at  the  hip,  all  three  of  us,  and  we  continue  to  work  very 
close together. 

Mr.  SPROAT.  I  would  say,  Senator,  as  a  proof  of  that,  one  of  the 
points I tried to make in my oral testimony was that we, the coun-
try,  have  had  over  3,000  successful  spent  nuclear  fuel  shipments 
already in the last 40 years with no release of radioactive material. 
And  I  think  that  demonstrated  safety  record  we  have  is  a  testa-
ment  to  the  regulatory  structure  that  these  agencies  have  put  to-
gether and the way that the Department of Energy and the private 
transportation sector works with them and within those regulatory 
structures  to  assure  the  safety  of  the  transportation  of  hazardous 
waste—hazardous materials on the roadways and railways. 

Senator  CARPER.  Anybody  else?  Is  it  Mr.  Willke?  Are  you  trying 

to say Willke or Willke? 

Dr. WILLKE. Willke. 
Senator  CARPER.  Mr.  Willke,  do  you  want  to  add  anything  to 

Dr.  WILLKE.  We  have  very  close  cooperation.  We  work  weekly, 
daily,  monthly  in  coordination  with  all  of  the  various  agencies,  in-
cluding  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  on  security 
issues. 

Senator CARPER. Do you all work on weekends? 
Mr. PRITCHARD. Yes, sir. 
Mr. SPROAT. Yes, we do. 
Senator CARPER. I was just checking. 
Can I have one more minute, Mr. Chairman? 
Is it Mr. Sproat? 
Mr. SPROAT. Yes. 
Senator  CARPER.  Would  you  take  your  name  tag  in  front  of  you 
and  raise  it  and  turn  it  around  so  the  audience  can  see  it  just  for 
a second? You see, it says, H-o-n. Sproat. Right? 

Mr. SPROAT. Yes. 
Senator CARPER. I had a phone call. You know, we are supposed 
to  have  these  do-not-call  kinds  of  things.  We  are  on  this  Do  Not 
Call List. But I was at home one night not long ago, and the phone 
rings. And I looked at the number. We have caller ID, and I looked 
at  the  number  and  did  not  recognize  it.  It  was  out  of  state,  and  I 
thought, well, maybe I should just ignore it, but I went ahead and 
answered  it.  And  the  person  at  the  other  end  of  the  phone  said,  I 
am  calling  Mr.  Carper.  I  said  this  is  Mr.  Carper.  And  they  said, 
Hon? Like H-o-n.

good charity that we had supported before. They said, Hon, we are

calling  to  thank  you  for  your  support.  And  we  were  just  calling.  It 
is  the  end  of  the  year.  We  are  doing  our  annual  fund  drive  and 
wanted  to  ask  you  to  help  more.  They  said,  this  is  Hon,  isn’t  it? 
And I waited for a moment and I said, this is Hon. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  CARPER.  Anyway,  it  became  clear  that  they  were  inter-
ested in more money. This person gave their pitch, and I said, Hon 
have no money. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator CARPER. Not to be deterred, they came right back, same 
pitch, even harder. I said, Hon have no money. Not to be deterred, 
one  more  time,  the  third  time,  they  came  back  to  me  again  with 
their  request.  And  I  said,  Hon  have  no  money.  Call  Hon.  Castle.

Senator  CARPER.  Congressman  Mike  Castle.  I  said,  Hon.  Castle

Senator CARPER. Hon. Sproat, welcome. To all of you, thank you. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  Thank  you  for  that  story.  I  am  not  sure  what 
it has to do with transporting nuclear waste, but I liked the story. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ENSIGN. I want to thank the witnesses of this panel. We 
have  to  get  going  to  the  next  panel.  So  I  want  to  thank  all  these 
witnesses and call the next panel.

STATEMENT OF SANDRA SCHUBERT, DIRECTOR, 

ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP 

Ms.  SCHUBERT.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Ensign,  for  the  oppor-
tunity  to  testify  today  on  the  safety  and  security  of  nuclear  waste 
transportation.  As  you  mentioned,  Ken  Cook,  the  President  of  the 
Environmental  Working  Group  had  been  asked  to  testify.  He  is 
very  sick  today  and  has  laryngitis,  so  he  asked  me  to  express  his 
regrets and step in for him.

uses the power of information to protect public health and the envi-
ronment. We have offices in Washington, D.C.; Oakland, California; 
and Ames, Iowa. 

Since 2002, EWG has produced analyses to help educate the pub-
lic  about  the  implications  of  transporting  radioactive  waste  from 
nuclear  powerplants  around  the  United  States  to  Yucca  Mountain, 
should  the  proposed  waste  repository  there  become  operational  or

nuclear  plants  continue  to  be  relicensed  or  expand  and  to  inform 
Congress, as it debates energy and climate change legislation. 

Today we would like to make three points. 
First, the American public’s fundamental right to understand the 
full  implications  of  shipping  thousands  of  tons  of  extremely  deadly 
hazardous  nuclear  waste  across  this  country  should  be  central  to 
the  Government’s  process  for  licensing  Yucca  Mountain,  for  oper-
ating  any  other  repository  for  this  material,  and  for  all  decisions 
to  relicense  existing  nuclear  reactors  or  build  new  ones.  The  Fed-
eral Government has not respected that right to know. 

It makes no sense to generate more nuclear waste when we have 
not  figured  out  what  to  do  with  the  tens  of  thousands  of  tons  al-
ready  on  hand.  Our  Government  has  ignored  that  common  sense 
precaution. 

The Government is rushing to approve the license application for 
Yucca Mountain before rudimentary, life and death questions have 
been  resolved  about  transportation,  storage,  and  a  truly  protective 
radiation  public  safety  standard.  We  should  not  burden  our  chil-
dren and their children with unacceptable risks. 

I would like to start with one vivid illustration that we prepared 
that  reflects  Ranking  Member  Hutchison’s  home  state  of  Texas. 
And  it  reflects  clearly  our  point  on  right  to  know.  There  is  a  map 
on  page  3  of  the  testimony.  We  have  it  reproduced  up  here.  We 
have a smaller map up here of Dallas, Texas, but what you will see 
on  the  map,  page  3,  is  the  official  nuclear  waste  transportation 
map  buried  in  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Environmental  Impact 
Statement. 

As  you  will  notice,  this  is  more  cartoon  than  cartography.  This 
illustration  depicts  only  one  major  city  in  Texas,  the  capital,  Aus-
tin,  as  well  as  facilities  from  which  lethal  radioactive  waste  could 
be  shipped  and  a  few  highway  designations  and  unnamed  rail 
lines. Unlike on the map we have up here and which is reproduced 
in  the  testimony,  you  will  not  find  Houston,  Dallas,  San  Antonio, 
or  any  other  major  Texas  cities  on  the  map.  However,  DOE’s  pro-
spective routes for shipping nuclear waste go through or near every 
one  of  these  cities  or  suburbs  or  around  them  and  countless  other 
communities in Texas. 

If  folks  did  somehow  find  their  way  to  the  EIS  and  the  proper 
appendix, they would not find any helpful details about how the po-
tential  routes  might  wind  their  way  through  towns  and  cities  or 
their  communities.  For  instance,  Texans  probably  do  not  realize 
that  2.336  million  Texans  live  within  1  mile  of  DOE’s  proposed 
Yucca  Mountain  routes  or  that  there  are  more  than  599  schools 
and  76  hospitals  within  a  mile  of  those  very  same  routes  or  that 
everyone  agrees  that  there  will  be  accidents  if  nuclear  waste  is 
transported as proposed. 

And,  I  would  like  to  shift  my  statement  here  a  little  bit  to  cite 
a report that talks about nuclear waste shipment accidents around 
the United States over the last 40 years. 

According to the CRS and others, there have been 72 reported in-
cidents involving radioactive waste shipments. This contradicts Mr. 
Sproat’s  figures  where  he  asserted  no  radioactive  waste  accidents 
have  occurred.  According  to  them,  in  four  cases,  radioactive  con-
tamination  has  gone  beyond  the  vehicle.  In  four  cases,  it  stayed

31 

within the vehicle. In 13 incidents, there was absolutely no release, 
and in 49 incidents, actual surface contamination of radiation that 
required  cleanup.  Now,  mind  you,  this  was  9,000  shipments  over 
40 years versus a possible 2,700 per year truck shipments to Yucca 
Mountain under DOE’s scenario. So those are the accidents we see 
over  40  years  under  a  much  lighter  travel  load  on  our  roadways. 
What would a crash mean for a city like Houston? A moderately 
serious  crash  that  would  crack  the  casks  and  cause  cesium  leaks 
but  not  puncture  or  penetrate  the  cask  could  expose  tens  of  thou-
sands of people to radiation, dangerous levels, in less than 10 min-
utes. Contamination plumes would range from 300 to 750 chest X- 
rays  equivalence  and  would  extend  up  to  1  mile  from  the  wreck. 
Closer  in,  people  would  be  exposed  to  the  equivalent  of  thousands 
of  chest  X-rays  in  the  first  hour  after  the  accident.  Based  on  Gov-
ernment data and models, we estimate that in Houston 525 people 
would ultimately suffer and die from latent cancers associated with 
this  exposure.  In  addition,  the  economic  costs  would  be  enormous 
with  the  cleanup  costs  alone  are  estimated  to  range  from  $10  bil-
lion to $150 billion, depending on the accident. And this is just one 
scenario. 

As you will notice on the charts we have put up, we tried to focus 
on  transportation  routes  in  major  cities  for  members  of  the  Com-
merce  Committee.  We  can  also  provide,  if  you  guys  are  interested, 
estimates  of  the  risk  for  death  for  many  of  these  cities,  not  all  of 
them, but many of them. 

Prior  to  recent  license  extensions,  DOE  has  estimated  that  it 
would take about 10,000 rail shipments or 50,000 truck shipments 
of nuclear waste through our communities to fill Yucca Mountain’s 
capacity.  Yet,  if  all  reactors  receive  10-  to  20-year  license  exten-
sions, DOE’s estimate of the total amount of waste generated in the 
U.S.  would  go  up  significantly,  meaning  additional  nuclear  waste 
shipments  through  our  neighborhoods.  If  rail  were  the  primary 
means of transporting the waste, which DOE is leaning toward, the 
10-year  license  extension  scenario  would  require  more  than  22,000 
cross-country shipments, or about 580 per year. 

Now,  maybe  constituents,  knowing  all  of  this,  would  still  decide 
that  it  makes  sense  to  put  radioactive  waste  on  their  highways  or 
they  would  make  the  decision  knowing  that  there  would  still  be 
much  radioactive  waste  left  onsite,  as  Senator  Ensign  pointed  out. 
Or  maybe  residents  of  your  states  would  conclude  that  reactors  in 
the states or reactors in states surrounding you that might be ship-
ping the waste through your state should operate for an additional 
20  more  years.  Or  maybe  they  would  approve  of  new  reactors  and 
new  license  extensions.  Or  maybe  if  they  really  understood  the 
ramifications of these decisions, they would not. 

Our point is that the people of every state have the right to know 
and  fully  understand  the  implications  for  them  of  the  transpor-
tation  of  nuclear  waste  in  their  communities,  of  the  Yucca  Moun-
tain  nuclear  waste  repository,  the  construction  of  new  reactors  be-
fore  licenses  go  forward,  the  permits  are  granted,  or  the  plans  are 
approved.  Decisions  made  hundreds  of  miles  away  will  have  pro-
found  implications  for  the  shipment  of  high-level,  deadly  nuclear 
waste through neighborhoods for decades to come. 

Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Cook follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KENNETH A. COOK, PRESIDENT, 

ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP 

Chairman  Inouye,  Ranking  Member  Hutchison,  distinguished  Members  of  the 
Committee:  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  crucial  issues  sur-
rounding  the  safety  and  security  of  the  transportation  of  lethal,  long-lived  nuclear 
waste  across  the  United  States.  My  name  is  Kenneth  Cook  and  I  am  President  of 
Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-profit environmental research and ad-
vocacy organization that uses the power of information to protect public health and 
the  environment.  EWG  has  offices  in  Washington,  D.C.;  Oakland,  California;  and 
Ames, Iowa. 

Since 2002, EWG has produced analyses to help educate the public about the im-
plications  of  transporting  deadly  radioactive  wastes  from  nuclear  power  plants 
around the United States to Yucca Mountain, should the proposed nuclear waste re-
pository there become operational. 

Today I want to emphasize three points: 

1. The American public’s fundamental right to understand the full implications 
of shipping thousands of tons of extremely hazardous nuclear waste across this 
country should be central to the government’s process for licensing Yucca Moun-
tain,  for  operating  any  other  repository  for  this  material,  and  for  all  decisions 
to  relicense  existing  reactors  or  build  new  ones.  The  Federal  Government  has 
not respected that right to know. 
2.  It  makes  no  sense  to  generate  tons  more  nuclear  waste  when  we  have  not 
figured out what to do with the tens of thousands of tons already on hand. Our 
government has ignored that common sense precaution. 
3.  The  government  is  rushing  to  approve  the  license  application  for  Yucca 
Mountain  before  rudimentary,  life  and  death  questions  have  been  resolved 
about  transportation,  storage,  and  a  truly  protective  radiation  safety  standard. 
We  should  not  burden  our  children  and  their  children  with  unacceptable  risks. 

Let me start with a vivid illustration of my first point.

Houston, Texas

Chairman  Inouye,  you  are  lucky,  nuclear  waste  transportation  is  not  an  issue  in 
Hawaii. However it is for nearly every other state and its citizens. Let’s take a look 
at this map depicting Ranking Member Hutchison’s home state of Texas. 

This map of Texas is the official transportation map, buried in Appendix J of the 
Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS)  for  the  pro-
posed  Yucca  Mountain  nuclear  waste  repository.1 It  is  a  nuclear  waste  transpor-
tation route map for Texas. More cartoon than cartography, this illustration depicts 
only  one  major  city  in  your  state—the  capitol,  Austin.  It  also  shows  the  location  of 
facilities  from  which  lethal  radioactive  waste  would  be  shipped  to  Yucca  Mountain 
if  it  is  ever  made  operational,  along  with  a  few  highway  designations  and  some 
unnamed rail lines. 

1 The maps reproduced herein appear identical to those used in the Draft Supplemental Envi-
ronmental  Impact  Statement  for  a  Geologic  Repository  for  the  Disposal  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel 
and  High-Level  Radioactive  Waste  at  Yucca  Mountain,  Nye  County,  Nevada  Volume  I  Impact 
Analyses,  Chapters  1  through  13,  U.S.  Department  of  Energy,  Office  of  Civilian  Radioactive 
Waste Management, DOE/EIS–0250F–S1D, October 2007, Section G–11.

You  will  not  find  Houston,  Dallas,  San  Antonio,  Amarillo,  Houston,  or  any  other 
major Texas cities on this map of nuclear waste routes to Yucca Mountain. But the 
Department of Energy’s prospective routes for shipping deadly nuclear reactor waste 
go through or near every one of those cities, or the suburbs around them, and count-
less other communities in Texas. 

If  Ranking  Member  Hutchison’s  constituents  did  somehow  find  their  way  to  Ap-
pendix  J  of  the  EIS  for  Yucca  Mountain,  they  would  not  find  any  telling  details 
about  how  the  potential  highway  or  rail  routes  might  wend  their  way  through  the 
towns and cities and communities of their state. 

The  people  of  Texas  probably  do  not  realize  that  2,336,290  Texans  live  within  a 
mile of those routes, or that there are more than 599 schools and 76 hospitals with-
in a mile of those routes. 

A  nuclear  transportation  accident  is  not  unlikely  or  unheard  of.  From  January 
through  June  2008,  there  were  1,203  train  accidents.  Thirteen,  or  1.08  percent,  of 
these  resulted  in  the  release  of  a  hazardous  material  and  the  evacuation  of  3,959 
people. Nearly 34 percent of these were attributable to human error, more than 13.5 
percent to equipment defects. Notably, these numbers do not include train-highway 
collisions.2 

Everyone  agrees  that  there  will  be  accidents  if  nuclear  waste  is  transported  by 
train and truck through 45 states for 38 years to the repository at Yucca Mountain 
in  Nevada.  DOE  predicts  that  there  will  be  about  100  accidents  over  the  life  of  the 
project. The state of Nevada predicts about 400 accidents during the same time pe-
riod. 

What would a crash mean for a city like Houston, TX? A moderately serious crash 
that  would  crack  the  cask  and  cause  cesium  leaks,  but  not  puncture  or  penetrate 
the  cask,  could  expose  tens  of  thousands  of  people  to  dangerous  levels  of  radiation. 
EPA’s  acceptable  dose  of  radiation  is  15  millirem,  equal  to  about  1.5  chest  x-rays 
per  year.  In  less  than  10  minutes,  contamination  plumes  ranging  from  300  to  750 
chest  x-rays  would  extend  up  to  1  mile  from  the  wreck.  Closer  in,  people  would  be 
exposed  to  the  equivalent  of  thousands  of  chest  x-rays  in  the  first  hour  after  the 
accident.  Based  on  government  data  and  models,  we  estimate  that  in  Houston  525 
people  would  ultimately  suffer  and  die  from  latent  cancers  associated  with  this  ex-
posure.  In  addition,  the  economic  costs  would  be  enormous,  with  the  cleanup  costs 
alone estimated to range from $10 to $150 billion.3 

Now, maybe, Texas constituents, knowing all that, would still decide that it makes 
sense to put lethal radioactive waste on Texas’s highways and rail lines, right near 
their  homes  and  through  their  communities,  en  route  to  Yucca  Mountain.  Maybe 
Texans would come to that decision knowing that plenty of waste would still remain 
to be dealt with at reactors in the state once Yucca Mountain is filled to its current 
statutory  limit.  Maybe  residents  of  Texas  would  still  conclude  that  reactors  in  the 
state, or in states to the north and east that might route waste through your state, 
should  operate  for  an  additional  twenty  years,  generating  more  nuclear  waste  and 
more shipments for decades. Maybe the people of Texas would approve of new reac-
tors being built, creating yet more waste at reactor sites, and on highways and rail-
ways, for generations to come. 

Or maybe they would not approve at all if they really knew what approval meant. 
Texans  and  all  other  citizens  have  a  right  to  know  the  implications  of  shipping 
waste to Yucca Mountain, or of expanding nuclear power and waste production, be-
fore decisions are made for them.

There  is  only  one  operating  nuclear  power  reactor  in  Missouri,  yet  under  DOE’s 
nuclear  waste  transportation  plan  Missouri  would  become  a  major  thoroughfare  for 
the  transportation  of  nuclear  waste  from  around  the  country  heading  to  the  pro-
posed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump. EWG estimates that 933,724 people live 
within  1  mile  of  the  DOE’s  proposed  routes  for  the  shipment  of  high-level  nuclear 
waste  across  Missouri  from  out  of  state;  some  2,780,602  people  live  within  5  miles. 
Our  geographic  information  system  analysis  also  finds  an  estimated  368  schools 
within 1 mile of the DOE’s proposed high-level nuclear waste transportation routes 
and  1,004  schools  within  5  miles.  We  also  estimate  that  28  hospitals  are  within  1 
mile and 55 hospitals are within 5 miles. 

Again,  localized,  community-specific  information  of  this  sort  might  or  might  not 
affect  the  opinions  of  Missourians  regarding  the  shipment  through  their  cities  and 
their  communities  of  nuclear  waste  from  other  states.  The  only  way  we  will  know 
if  this  information  is  important  is  if  we  entrust  it  to  the  people  of  Missouri  before 
decisions that affect them are made.

There  are  many  examples  of  how  government  is  violating  people’s  right  to  know 
how the transportation of nuclear waste will affect them. The Department of Energy 
and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have not: 

• Implemented the safety recommendations of the National Academies of Sciences 
February 2006 report Going the Distance? The Safe Transport of Spent Nuclear 
Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste in the United States; 
• Addressed  the  security  threats  posed  by  the  transportation  of  spent  nuclear 
• Planned  for  full  scale  physical  testing  of  spent  fuel  transportation  casks  to  de-

fuel; or 

termine basic safety issues, such as crash failure thresholds. 

We have seen the damage that terrorists, natural disasters and failing infrastruc-
ture  can  wreak.  Imagine  the  catastrophic  nature  of  those  events  if  nuclear  waste 
were involved. We must address the public’s questions about the safety and security 
of nuclear waste and its transportation through our neighborhoods. 

People in every state have a right to know and fully understand the implications 
for  them  of  the  transportation  of  nuclear  waste  in  their  communities,  the  Yucca 
Mountain nuclear waste repository, and the construction of new reactors before the 
licenses go forward, the permits are granted, or the plans approved. Decisions made 
hundreds  of  miles  away  will  have  profound  implications  for  the  shipment  of  high- 
level, deadly nuclear waste through their neighborhoods for decades to come. 
Nuclear Relicensing and Increased Transportation Risks 

A little-noticed surge in relicensing of nuclear reactors will put thousands of met-
ric  tons  of  high-level  nuclear  waste  on  our  railways  and  roadways.  The  relicensing 
through  2007  alone  will  add  about  16,500  metric  tons  to  the  Nation’s  inventory  of 
spent nuclear fuel, increasing transportation of radioactive waste through our neigh-
borhoods  and  prolonging  storage  problems  through  the  middle  of  the  century  at  re-
actor  sites  across  the  country,  effectively  transforming  over  a  dozen  power  plants 
into long term nuclear waste dumps. 

Yet,  nuclear  power  plant  licenses  are  being  extended,  largely  in  response  to  the 
congressional  approval  to  move  forward  on  the  proposed  nuclear  waste  dump  at 
Yucca  Mountain,  Nevada,  and  the  administration  and  Congressional  leaders’  push 
for  a  nuclear  ‘‘renaissance,’’  and  these  licenses  are  being  extended  for  longer  than 
DOE has ever predicted in any of their analyses of Yucca’s overall capacity. 

An  EWG  Action  Fund  analysis  of  relicensing  of  nuclear  facilities  found  that  the 
48  reactors  at  26  nuclear  power  plants  relicensed  from  2000  to  2007  (see  attached 
table) would generate a projected 16,500 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste over 
the  20-year  period  of  their  license  extensions.  Eighteen  more  reactors  at  13  power 
plants  with  license  extensions  pending  (no  application  to  date  has  been  denied) 
would add another 6,000 metric tons of waste to this, for a total of 22,500 additional 
metric tons of nuclear waste traveling through our communities. 

Prior to recent license extensions, DOE estimated that it would take about 10,000 
rail shipments or 50,000 truck shipments of nuclear waste to fill the nuclear power 
industry’s  share  of  Yucca  Mountain,  or  about  90  percent  of  its  federally  limited  ca-
pacity  of  70,000  metric  tons.  Relicensing  through  September  2004  alone  has  added 
about  5,700  more  truck  shipments,  or  1,050  rail  shipments  to  that  total.  It  would 
require  a  formal  expansion  of  the  Yucca  repository  to  dump  this  nuclear  waste  in 
Nevada. 

Further,  if  all  reactors  receive  20-year  as  opposed  to  10-year  extensions,  DOE’s 
estimate  of  the  total  amount  of  waste  generated  in  the  U.S.  would  increase  to  ap-
proximately 135,000 metric tons. 

Those  20,000  metric  tons  would  mean  even  more  cross-country  shipments  of  nu-
clear waste than are projected for DOE’s worst-case scenario. In that worst-case sce-
nario,  based  on  10-year  license  extensions,  transporting  our  Nation’s  nuclear  waste 
mostly  by  truck  would  require  about  108,900  shipments  over  38  years,  or  about 
2,870  per  year.  If  rail  were  the  primary  means  of  transporting  the  waste,  the  10- 
year  license  extension  scenario  would  require  more  than  22,000  cross-country  ship-
ments, or about 580 per year.4 

The  rail  transport  scenario  does  not  include  barge  and  heavy  haul  truck  ship-
ments  from  24  nuclear  reactors  that  lack  rail  access.  Thousands  of  such  shipments 
would be required. This analysis also does not include the proposed Nevada rail ex-
tension,  the  Caliente  Corridor,  which  would  be  the  largest  rail  project  in  decades.

In  addition,  DOE’s  analysis  does  not  include  the  heavy  haul  truck  shipments  re-
quired  within  Nevada  if  there  is  no  rail  spur  to  connect  to  Yucca  Mountain.  Ten 
to nineteen thousand additional shipments would be required.5 

This result of the government’s push to license the proposed Yucca Mountain nu-
clear  waste  dump  and  its  subsidization  of  the  nuclear  industry  while  ignoring  the 
public health, environmental and economic costs of these activities virtually guaran-
tees that: 

• Nuclear  power  plants  would  be  transformed  into  long-term  nuclear  waste 
dumps. The recent surge in reactor relicensing ensures that hundreds of metric 
tons of extremely hazardous, high-level nuclear waste would remain in place at 
reactors around the country, as more waste is produced long after the proposed 
Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump would be full. 
• The proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump would have to be expanded 
or  a  second  repository  opened  to  accommodate  the  additional  waste.  By  law, 
Yucca  Mountain  is  limited  to  70,000  metric  tons  of  nuclear  waste,  which  is  al-
most equal to the amount of nuclear waste that will be stored on-site at reactors 
around the country in 2010, well before any repository could be opened. 
• If  rail  were  the  primary  means  of  transporting  the  waste,  the  security  and 
health  risks  inherent  in  these  shipments  are  enormous,  and  preparedness  is 
minimal. 
• The public would be unaware of, and unprepared for, the implications of policy 
decisions  regarding  nuclear  power  and  nuclear  waste  and  its  transportation 
through its neighborhoods. 

People  of  every  state  have  a  right  to  know  and  fully  understand  the  implications 
for them of shipping nuclear waste to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository 
before  shipping  begins  or  the  license  for  the  facility  goes  forward.  And  they  have 
the  same  right  to  know  what  expansion  of  nuclear  waste  generation  will  mean  for 
transportation  through  their  state  if  reactors  around  the  country  are  relicensed  for 
10  to  20  additional  years  of  operation,  or  new  reactors  are  constructed.  They  may 
or  may  not  know  that  decisions  made  hundreds  of  miles  away  will  have  profound 
implications  for  the  shipment  of  high-level,  deadly  nuclear  waste  through  their 
neighborhoods for decades to come. 
Concluding Observations 

I  think  we  are  all  aware  that  the  U.S.  nuclear  industry  would  not  split  an  atom 

without a subsidy. They never have, and they never will. 

Nuclear  energy  companies  never  hesitate  to  lean  on  American  taxpayers  for 
money  to  conduct  nuclear  research,  for  indemnification  in  the  event  of  horrific  nu-
clear  accidents,  for  money  to  clean  up  industry’s  lethal  waste  and  cost  overruns,  or 
for  the  collateral  of  the  public’s  purse—loan  guarantees—something  the  companies 
are  seeking  today  to  coax  investors  out  of  their  sober  reluctance  to  put  money  into 
new nuclear reactors. 

But  the  ultimate  subsidy  for  the  nuclear  industry  may  well  be  our  government’s 
scandalous  failure  to  fully  inform  our  own  people  about  the  potential  consequence 
of the transportation of nuclear waste through their communities until it is too late 
for  the  people  to  do  anything  about  it  but  accept  the  risk,  the  expense,  or  the  un-
thinkable. 

I thank you, Chairman Inouye, Ranking Member Hutchison, and Members of the 
Committee for this opportunity to testify, and I look forward to answering any ques-
tions or providing additional information at the pleasure of the Committee.

STATEMENT  OF  KEVIN  D.  CROWLEY,  PH.D.,  SENIOR  BOARD 
DIRECTOR,  NUCLEAR  AND  RADIATION  STUDIES  BOARD, 
NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES 
Dr.  CROWLEY.  Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Ensign  and  Senator 
Thune.  My  name  is  Kevin  Crowley.  I  am  the  Director  of  the  Na-
tional  Research  Council’s  Nuclear  and  Radiation  Studies  Board, 
and I also directed two National Research Council studies that are 
directly relevant to the subject of this hearing. I would like to talk 
a  little  bit  about  some  of  the  principal  findings  and  recommenda-
tions  from  those.  The  reports  were  entitled  ‘‘Going  the  Distance? 
The  Safe  Transport  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  and  High-Level  Radio-
active  Waste  in  the  United  States’’  and  ‘‘Safety  and  Security  of 
Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage.’’ 

The packages that are used to transport spent fuel play a crucial 
role  in  transportation  safety  by  providing  a  robust  barrier  to  the 
release  of  radiation  and  radioactive  material.  The  Going  the  Dis-

I  will  focus  my  oral  summary  on  the  key  findings  that  relate  to 
transportation safety, transportation security, and Yucca Mountain 
challenges. 

With  respect  to  key  transportation  safety  challenges,  the  Com-
mittee  that  authored  the  Going  the  Distance  report  found  that  it 
could  identify  no  fundamental  technical  barriers  to  the  safe  trans-
port  of  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  in  the  United  States.  From 
a  technical  standpoint,  transport  is  a  low  radiological  risk  activity 
with  manageable  safety,  health,  and  environmental  consequences 
when conducted in strict adherence to existing regulations.

tance  report  noted  that  current  international  standards  and  U.S. 
regulations  are  adequate  to  ensure  containment  effectiveness  of 
transport packages even in severe accidents. 

However,  there  may  be  extreme  accident  conditions  involving 
very  long  duration  fires  that  could  compromise  package  contain-
ment.  The  report  recommended  that  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Com-
mission  undertake  additional  analyses  of  such  accident  conditions 
and implement operational controls and restrictions as necessary to 
reduce the chances that such conditions might be encountered dur-
ing transport. 

With  respect  to  key  transportation  security  challenges,  the  Na-
tional  Research  Council  study  on  Safety  and  Security  of  Commer-
cial Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage examined the consequences of sab-
otage  and  terrorist  attacks  on  spent  fuel  in  storage  at  civilian  nu-
clear  plants.  This  work  is  relevant  to  spent  fuel  transport  security 
because some storage packages can also be used for transportation. 
The unclassified report from the study notes that all storage pack-
age  designs  are  vulnerable  to  some  types  of  terrorist  attacks  for 
which  releases  of  radioactive  material  would  be  possible,  although 
the  magnitudes  of  such  releases  are  predicted  to  be  small.  How-
ever,  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  storage  packages  at  fixed 
sites,  such  as  nuclear  plants,  are  easier  to  protect  from  certain 
kinds  of  terrorist  attacks  than  spent  fuel  packages  in  transport  on 
the Nation’s highways and railways. 

The  Going  the  Distance  report  recommended  that  ‘‘an  inde-
pendent  examination  of  the  security  of  spent  fuel  and  high-level 
waste  transportation  should  be  carried  out  prior  to  the  commence-
ment  of  large-quantity  shipments  to  a  Federal  repository  or  to  in-
terim storage. This examination should provide an integrated eval-
uation of the threat environment, the response of packages to cred-
ible malevolent acts, and operational security requirements for pro-
tecting spent fuel and high-level waste while in transport.’’ 

I  have  a  longer  write-up  in  my  written  testimony  about  the 
Yucca Mountain challenges. Let me close by just highlighting a few 
findings and recommendations from my longer testimony. 

The Going the Distance report strongly endorsed DOE’s decisions 
to  ship  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  to  a  Federal  repository  by 
mostly  rail  using  dedicated  trains.  The  report  recommended  that 
DOE  fully  implement  these  decisions  before  commencing  large- 
quantity shipments to the repository. 

The  report  also  recommended  that  DOE  should  identify  and 
make  public  its  suite  of  preferred  highway  and  rail  routes  for 
transporting spent fuel and high-level waste to a Federal repository 
as  soon  as  practicable  to  support  State,  tribal,  and  local  planning. 
DOE should negotiate with commercial spent fuel owners to ship 
older fuel first to a Federal repository or to interim storage. Should 
these negotiations prove to be ineffective, Congress should consider 
legislative remedies. 

DOE  should  initiate  transport  to  the  Federal  repository  through 
a pilot program involving relatively short, logistically simple move-
ments  of  older  fuel  from  closed  reactors  to  demonstrate  its  ability 
to carry out its responsibilities in a safe and operationally effective 
manner.

And  finally,  the  Secretary  of  Energy  and  the  U.S.  Congress 
should examine options for changing the organizational structure of 
DOE’s  program  for  transporting  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  to 
a Federal repository to increase its chances for success. 

I will stop there. I will be happy to elaborate on any of my com-

ments during the Q&A. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KEVIN D.  CROWLEY,  PH.D.,  SENIOR BOARD DIRECTOR, 
NUCLEAR AND RADIATION STUDIES BOARD,  NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, 
THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES 
Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Inouye  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  My  name  is 
Kevin  Crowley,  and  I  am  the  Director  of  the  National  Research  Council’s  Nuclear 
and Radiation Studies Board.1 I also directed two National Research Council studies 
that  are  relevant  to  this  hearing  on  the  safety  and  security  of  spent  nuclear  fuel 
transportation: 

• Going  the  Distance?  The  Safe  Transport  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  and  High-Level 

Radioactive Waste in the United States 2 

• Safety and Security of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage 3 

Both of these reports were published in 2006. The latter report, which has classified 
and  unclassified  versions,  was  the  product  of  a  congressionally  mandated  study. 
That  study  examined  the  safety  and  security  of  dry  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel 
at  civilian  nuclear  power  plants.  Some  of  the  results  of  that  study  have  informed 
my comments on transportation security. 

My  testimony  is  provided  in  three  parts:  transportation  safety  challenges,  trans-
portation  security  challenges,  and  the  challenges  associated  with  transportation  of 
spent fuel to the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. 
Transportation Safety Challenges 

My  comments  on  the  safety 4 challenges  associated  with  transporting  nuclear 
waste  will  focus  specifically  on  the  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  generated 
by  civilian  nuclear  power  plants.  Spent  fuel  is  highly  radioactive  and  can  cause  se-
vere  harm  to  humans  and  the  environment,  if  not  properly  managed.  Immediately 
after  its  discharge  from  a  power  reactor,  for  example,  the  radiation  emitted  from  a 
single  spent  fuel  assembly  would  be  lethal  to  a  nearby  unshielded  person  for  expo-
sure periods on the order of minutes. Spent fuel becomes less radioactive with time, 
but  even  after  several  years  of  storage  it  is  still  highly  radioactive  and  can  cause 
both immediate (i.e., radiation sickness and death) and delayed (e.g., cancer) effects 
in exposed populations if not properly managed. 

There  are  at  least  three  factors  that  promote  the  safety  of  spent  fuel  transpor-

tation in the United States: 

• Storage  before  shipping:  Civilian  spent  fuel  must  be  stored  for  at  least  a  year 
before  it  can  be  transported,  and  current  industry  practice  is  to  store  this  fuel 
for  at  least  5  years  before  transporting  it.  This  provides  time  for  radioactive 
decay in the spent fuel, which helps to reduce its hazard. 
• Transport  packages:  Spent  fuel  is  transported  in  packages  (also  referred  to  as 
shipping casks) that are designed to shield the radiation that is emitted by the 
fuel and also to prevent the release of radioactive material, even in severe acci-
dents. 
• Conduct  of  transport  operations:  There  are  strict  regulatory  requirements  for 
selection  of  shipping  routes,  advance  notification  of  state  authorities  before 
shipments are made, and for shipping operations. 

1 The  National  Research  Council  is  the  operating  arm  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences, 
National  Academy  of  Engineering,  and  the  Institute  of  Medicine  of  the  National  Academies, 
chartered  by  Congress  in  1863  to  advise  the  government  on  matters  of  science  and  technology. 
The  Nuclear  and  Radiation  Studies  Board  is  responsible  for  oversight  of  National  Research 
Council studies on safety and security of nuclear materials and waste.

The National Research Council’s Going the Distance report provides a detailed dis-
cussion  and  analysis  of  the  safety  of  spent  fuel  transportation,  focusing  on  the  de-
sign  and  testing  of  packages  used  to  transport  spent  fuel  and  on  the  historical 
record  of  spent  fuel  shipments.  Based  on  this  analysis,  the  expert  committee 5 that 
conducted this study found that it 

‘‘. . .  could  identify  no  fundamental  technical  barriers  to  the  safe  transport  of 
spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in the United States. Trans-
port by highway (for small-quantity shipments 6) and by rail (for large-quantity 
shipments)  is,  from  a  technical  viewpoint,  a  low-radiological-risk  activity  with 
manageable safety, health, and environmental consequences when conducted in 
strict  adherence  to  existing  regulations.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  social 
and  institutional  challenges  to  the  successful  initial  implementation  of  large- 
quantity shipping programs that will require expeditious resolution. . . . More-
over,  the  challenges  of  sustained  implementation  should  not  be  underesti-
mated.’’ 

I  want  to  emphasize  that  this  finding  focused  on  the  technical  aspects  of  spent 
fuel  and  high-level  waste  transportation—for  example,  the  design,  fabrication,  and 
maintenance  of  the  packages  and  conveyances  used  for  transporting  spent  fuel  and 
the  conduct  of  transportation  operations.  This  finding  is  predicated  on  the  assump-
tion that these technical tasks are being carried out with a high degree of care and 
in  strict  adherence  to  regulations.  The  finding  also  is  based  on  an  assessment  of 
past and present transportation programs and would apply to future programs only 
to the extent that they continue to exercise appropriate care and adherence to appli-
cable regulations. Continued vigilance by all parties involved in these transportation 
programs,  including  planners,  shippers,  and  regulators,  will  be  required  to  ensure 
that  transportation  operations  in  the  United  States  continue  to  be  conducted  in  a 
safe  manner,  especially  if  and  when  the  large-quantity  shipping  program  to  Yucca 
Mountain is initiated. 

The packages that are used to transport spent fuel play a crucial role in transpor-
tation safety by providing a robust barrier to the release of radiation and radioactive 
material. In fact, the robust design of these packages helps to minimize the impacts 
of  human  error  on  transport  safety.  The  committee  that  conducted  the  Going  the 
Distance study found that current international standards and U.S. regulations are 
adequate  to  ensure  package  containment  effectiveness 7 during  both  routine  trans-
port and in severe accidents. However, the study committee noted that recently pub-
lished  work  suggests  that  there  may  be  a  very  small  number  of  extreme  accident 
conditions  involving  very  long  duration  fires 8 that  could  compromise  package  con-
tainment  effectiveness.  The  study  committee  recommended  that  the  U.S.  Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  (USNRC)  undertake  additional  analyses  of  very  long  dura-
tion fire scenarios that bound expected real-world accident conditions. Based on the 
results  of  these  investigations,  the  study  committee  also  recommended  that  the 
USNRC implement operational controls and restrictions on spent fuel and high-level 
waste  shipments  as  necessary  to  reduce  the  chances  that  such  conditions  might  be 
encountered  in  service.  The  study  committee  further  recommended  that  transpor-
tation  planners  and  managers  undertake  detailed  surveys  of  transportation  routes 
to  identify  and  mitigate  the  potential  hazards  that  could  lead  to  or  exacerbate  ex-
treme accidents involving such fires. 

5 Committee  on  Transportation  of  Radioactive  Waste.  Dr.  Neal  Lane,  a  physicist  at  Rice  Uni-
versity and former director of the National Science Foundation and Presidential science advisor, 
chaired this study. 

6 The  Going  the  Distance  report  identified  two  general  types  of  transportation  programs, 
small-quantity  shipping  programs  and  large-quantity  shipping  programs.  The  former  involve 
shipment  on  the  order  of  tens  of  metric  tons  of  spent  fuel  or  high-level  waste,  while  the  latter 
involve  shipment  on  the  order  of  hundreds  to  thousands  of  metric  tons.  The  program  to  trans-
port  spent  fuel  to  the  proposed  repository  at  Yucca  Mountain  would  be  an  example  of  a  large- 
quantity shipping program. 

7 That is, the ability of a transportation package to contain its radioactive contents and main-
tain  its  radiation  shielding  effectiveness  during  routine  use  and  under  severe  accident  condi-
tions. 

8 The  USNRC  requires  that  packages  be  designed  to  maintain  containment  effectiveness  in  a 
30-minute  fire  that  is  fully  engulfing.  A  very  long  duration  fire  is  a  fire  that  burns  for  much 
longer periods, for example, hours to days.

Transportation Security Challenges 

50 

Let  me  now  turn  to  the  security 9 of  spent  fuel  transportation.  Many  of  the  regu-
latory  requirements  that  are  in  place  to  promote  the  safety  of  spent  fuel  transport 
also  help  to  promote  security.  For  example,  the  robust  shipping  packages  that  are 
used to protect spent fuel in the event of a severe accident would also help to protect 
spent fuel against some types of sabotage and terrorist attacks. There are additional 
regulatory requirements that also help to promote security of spent fuel shipments: 
for  example,  the  USNRC  conducts  route  inspections  to  identify  potential  security 
vulnerabilities as part of its route approval process; it has established requirements 
for armed escorts when shipments pass through highly populated regions; and it has 
established  other  requirements  for  equipment  security  and  communications.  Some 
of  these  regulatory  requirements  were  revised  after  the  September  11,  2001,  ter-
rorist attacks, and some specific requirements have not been disclosed to the public 
to protect national security. 

However, transportation security differs from transportation safety in at least one 
important respect: safety problems arise from human error and equipment malfunc-
tions  that  are  amenable  to  quantitative  analysis,  whereas  security  problems  arise 
from intentional malevolent acts that generally do not lend themselves to such anal-
ysis.  Transportation  safety  analyses,  for  example,  rely  heavily  on  the  historical 
record  for  shipping  other  types  of  hazardous  materials.  This  record  allows  analysts 
to  identify  severe  accident  scenarios  that  might  be  a  concern  for  spent  fuel  trans-
port—for  example,  train  collisions  or  derailments  that  expose  shipping  packages  to 
large impact forces or severe fires—and also provides analysts with reliable data on 
the  frequency  of  occurrence  of  such  accidents.  These  accident  scenario  and  accident 
frequency  data  can  be  used  to  quantitatively  model  the  safety  consequences  of  se-
vere accidents involving spent fuel. 

There is no comparable historical record that can be used to develop quantitative 
estimates  of  sabotage  or  attack  scenarios  or  their  frequency  of  occurrence.  Instead, 
analysts  must  rely  on  expert  judgments  about  the  threat  environment  and  terror-
ists’  access  to  technical  means  and  opportunity  for  attacking  or  sabotaging  spent 
fuel shipments. I should note that this security challenge is not unique to spent fuel 
transportation, but is also faced by owners and operators of other critical infrastruc-
ture. 

A great deal of work has been carried out in the United States and in some other 
countries to understand the potential consequences of sabotage and terrorist attacks 
on spent fuel shipments. Most of this work is classified or otherwise restricted from 
public release. The National Research Council study on Safety and Security of Com-
mercial  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  Storage  examined  some  of  the  relevant  work  that  has 
been  carried  out  by  Sandia  National  Laboratories  and  others  to  estimate  the  con-
sequences  of  sabotage  or  terrorist  attacks  on  spent  fuel  being  stored  at  civilian  nu-
clear  plants.10 This  work  is  relevant  to  spent  fuel  transport  security  because  some 
of the packages that are used to store spent fuel at civilian nuclear plants can also 
be  used  for  transportation.  The  study  committee’s 11 detailed  analyses  of  the  con-
sequences  of  various  terrorist  attack  scenarios  are  classified;  however,  the  study 
committee’s unclassified report notes that all storage cask designs are vulnerable to 
some  types  of  terrorist  attacks  for  which  releases  of  radioactive  material  would  be 
possible,  although  the  magnitudes  of  such  releases  are  predicted  to  be  small.  How-
ever,  it  is  important  to  recognize  that  storage  casks  at  fixed  sites  such  as  nuclear 
plants are in principle easier to protect from certain kinds of terrorist attacks than 
spent fuel packages in transport on the Nation’s highways and railways. 

The  National  Research  Council’s  Going  the  Distance  study  was  organized  before 
the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks  on  the  United  States.  It  was  focused  pri-
marily on the safety of spent fuel and high-level waste transport because this issue 
was  receiving  the  most  public  attention  when  the  study  was  organized.  Once  the 
study was begun, however, it soon became clear that transportation security had es-
tablished  itself  in  the  public’s  consciousness  as  a  top  concern  along  with  transpor-
tation  safety.  The  study  committee  was  not  able  to  conduct  an  in-depth  review  of 
transportation  security  because  of  information  access  constraints.  However,  the 
study committee found that ‘‘malevolent acts against spent fuel and high-level waste 
shipments  are  a  major  technical  and  societal  concern,  especially  following  the  Sep-

9 Security  involves  measures  taken  to  protect  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  against  sabo-

tage, attacks, and theft while it is in transport. 

10 This  study  examined  both  wet  storage  of  spent  fuel  in  pools  and  dry  storage  in  casks.  My 

comments in this testimony are focused only on dry storage.

tember  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks  on  the  United  States.’’  The  study  committee  also 
recommended that 

‘‘An independent examination of the security of spent fuel and high-level waste 
transportation  should  be  carried  out  prior  to  the  commencement  of  large-quan-
tity  shipments  to  a  Federal  repository  or  to  interim  storage.  This  examination 
should provide an integrated evaluation of the threat environment, the response 
of  packages  to  credible  malevolent  acts,  and  operational  security  requirements 
for protecting spent fuel and high-level waste while in transport. This examina-
tion  should  be  carried  out  by  a  technically  knowledgeable  group  that  is  inde-
pendent of the government and free from institutional and financial conflicts of 
interest. This group should be given full access to the necessary classified docu-
ments and Safeguards Information to carry out this task. The findings and rec-
ommendations from this examination should be made available to the public to 
the fullest extent possible.’’ 

I  want  to  emphasize  that  this  recommendation  was  not  made  because  the  study 
committee had specific knowledge of vulnerabilities of spent fuel shipments to sabo-
tage or terrorist attacks. Instead, it was motivated primarily by concerns that were 
expressed  to  the  study  committee  about  whether  such  shipments  could  be  made  in 
a  secure  fashion  in  spite  of  reassurances  from  Federal  agencies.  The  study  com-
mittee recognized that the Federal agencies were in a difficult position on this issue 
because as much as they might like to share security-related information that might 
help  to  inform  the  public,  there  were  legitimate  national  security  reasons  for  not 
doing so. The study committee judged that an independent review would help to im-
prove  the  technical  soundness  of  the  agencies’  security  programs  for  spent  fuel 
transportation and also help to reassure the public that the agencies’ programs were 
proceeding on a sound technical basis. 
Transportation Challenges for Yucca Mountain 

The  primary  challenges  for  the  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  program  arise 
from  at  least  three  factors:  the  large  number  of  shipments  that  are  planned;  the 
two-decade-plus-time  period  over  which  the  transportation  program  must  be  oper-
ated  in  a  safe  and  secure  manner;  and  the  long  lead  times  and  large  expenditures 
that  will  be  required  to  put  the  necessary  transportation  infrastructure  in  place. 
The  National  Research  Council’s  Going  the  Distance  report  noted  that  the  planned 
number of rail shipments to a repository at Yucca Mountain under the Department 
of  Energy’s  (DOE’s)  ‘‘mostly  rail’’  scenario  is  approximately  18  times  the  number  of 
rail  shipments  that  have  occurred  in  the  United  States  between  1964  and  2004.12 
In  other  words,  previous  spent  fuel  transport  experience  in  the  United  States  is 
small  compared  with  the  numbers  of  shipments  that  will  be  needed  to  move  spent 
fuel and high-level waste to a Yucca Mountain repository. 

The  National  Research  Council  committee  that  authored  the  Going  the  Distance 
report  provided  several  findings  and  recommendations  for  improving  the  Yucca 
Mountain transportation program; these are summarized below: 

• The  study  committee  strongly  endorsed  DOE’s  decisions  to  ship  spent  fuel  and 
high-level  waste  to  the  Federal  repository  by  ‘‘mostly  rail’’  using  dedicated 
trains.  This  approach  would  reduce  routine  radiological  exposures;  provide  for 
greater physical separation from other vehicular traffic and reduced interactions 
with people along transportation routes; and simplify operational logistics. It is 
also  the  approach  that  is  preferred  by  the  public.  The  study  committee  rec-
ommended that DOE fully implement this approach by completing construction 
of  the  Nevada  rail  spur  and  making  other  necessary  arrangements  before  com-
mencing  large-quantity  shipments  to  the  repository.  The  study  committee  also 
recommended that DOE examine the feasibility of further reducing its needs for 
cross-country truck shipments 13 of spent fuel. 
• DOE  should  identify  and  make  public  its  suite  of  preferred  highway  and  rail 
routes  for  transporting  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  to  a  Federal  repository 
as soon as practicable to support state, tribal, and local planning, especially for 
emergency  responder  preparedness.  DOE  should  follow  the  practices  of  its  for-

12 The Yucca Mountain EIS noted that DOE plans to make up to 9600 rail shipments of spent 
fuel  and  high-level  waste  to  the  repository.  The  Going  the  Distance  study  estimates  that  about 
540  rail  shipments  of  spent  fuel  were  made  in  the  United  States  between  1964  and  2004.  The 
actual  number  of  rail  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain  would  depend  on  how  DOE  conducts  its 
transport operations. 

13 Even  under  the  ‘‘mostly  rail’’  scenario,  DOE  estimated  in  its  Yucca  Mountain  EIS  that 

about 1100 truck shipments would be made to the repository.

eign research reactor spent fuel transport program of involving states and tribes 
in these route selections.14 

• DOE should negotiate with commercial spent fuel owners to ship older fuel first 
to  a  Federal  repository  or  to  Federal  interim  storage.15 Should  these  negotia-
tions  prove  to  be  ineffective,  Congress  should  consider  legislative  remedies. 
Within  the  context  of  its  current  contracts  with  commercial  spent  fuel  owners, 
DOE should initiate transport to the Federal repository through a pilot program 
involving  relatively  short,  logistically  simple  movements  of  older  fuel  from 
closed  reactors  to  demonstrate  its  ability  to  carry  out  its  responsibilities  in  a 
safe and operationally effective manner. 

• DOE  should  begin  immediately  to  execute  its  emergency  responder  prepared-
ness  responsibilities  defined  in  Section  180(c)  of  the  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act. 
The study committee recommended several approaches for carrying out this rec-
ommendation. 

• DOE,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  Department  of  Transportation, 
and USNRC should promptly complete the job of developing, applying, and dis-
closing  consistent,  reasonable,  and  understandable  criteria  for  protecting  sen-
sitive information about spent fuel and high-level waste shipments. They should 
also  commit  to  the  open  sharing  of  information  that  does  not  require  such  pro-
tection  and  should  facilitate  timely  access  to  such  information,  for  example,  by 
posting it on readily accessible websites. 

• DOE  should  take  early  and  proactive  steps  to  establish  formal  mechanisms  for 
gathering  high-quality  and  diverse  advice  about  social  risks 16 and  their  man-
agement on an ongoing basis. 

• The  Secretary  of  Energy  and  the  U.S.  Congress  should  examine  options  for 
changing  the  organizational  structure  of  DOE’s  program  for  transporting  spent 
fuel and high-level waste to a Federal repository to increase its chances for suc-
cess.  The  following  three  alternative  organizational  structures,  which  are  rep-
resentative of progressively greater organizational change, should be examined: 
(1)  a  quasi-independent  DOE  office  reporting  directly  to  upper-level  DOE  man-
agement; (2) a quasi-government corporation; or (3) a fully private organization 
operated by the commercial nuclear industry. 

The  study  committee  found  that  successful  execution  of  DOE’s  program  to  trans-
port  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  to  a  Federal  repository  will  be  difficult  given 
the  organizational  structure  in  which  it  is  embedded,  despite  the  high  quality  of 
many  program  staff.  As  currently  structured,  the  program  has  limited  flexibility 
over  commercial  spent  fuel  acceptance  order;  it  also  has  limited  control  over  its 
budget  and  is  subject  to  the  annual  Federal  appropriations  process,  both  of  which 
affect the program’s ability to plan for, procure, and construct the needed transpor-
tation infrastructure. Moreover, the current program may have difficulty supporting 
what appears to be an expanding future mission to transport commercial spent nu-
clear  fuel  for  interim  storage  or  reprocessing.  In  the  study  committee’s  judgment, 
changing the organizational structure of this program would improve its chances for 
success. 

This concludes my testimony to the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
testify on these important issues. I would be happy to elaborate on any of my com-
ments during the question and answer period.

16 Social  risks  arise  from  social  processes  and  human  perceptions.  Social  processes  shape  the 
communities  in  which  people  live  by,  for  example,  influencing  choices  about  where  to  purchase 
or  rent  a  home,  where  to  work,  and  where  to  send  children  to  school.  Social  perceptions  can 
have  a  strong  influence  on  peoples’  behavior,  whether  or  not  such  perceptions  are  an  accurate 
picture of reality.

STATEMENT OF JAMES DAVID BALLARD, PH.D., ASSOCIATE 
PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, CALIFORNIA 

STATE UNIVERSITY, NORTHRIDGE (CSUN); DIRECTOR, CSUN 

INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY CENTER ACADEMIC 

EXCELLENCE (IC–CAE); CONSULTANT, NUCLEAR WASTE 

PROJECT OFFICE, STATE OF NEVADA 

Dr. BALLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  am  a  professor  at  California  State  University,  Northridge.  My 
specialty  is  terrorism.  I  am  in  the  Sociology  Department  where  I 
run  a  center  funded  by  the  ODNI,  which  is  to  help  our  students 
do  analysis  of  just  such  projects  as  these.  I  have  been  engaged  in 
this  enterprise  of  looking  at  Yucca  Mountain  security  risks  for  14 
years  and  have  worked  with  the  State  of  Nevada  over  that  time. 

I thank you very much for allowing me to come here today. 
I  do  have  three  points  that  I  would  like  to  make,  and  these  re-
flect my own personal opinions and not those of any of the agencies 
that I may have affiliation with. 

First, number one, the Yucca Mountain project as it is conceived 
presents  a  target-rich  environment  and  we  should  consider  the 
shelter-in-place  option  that  Senator  Reid  discussed  earlier.  The 
Yucca  Mountain  transportation  program  is  a  security  risk  in  and 
of itself. This is a large-scale Federal program that will draw atten-
tion  from  a  wide  variety  of  adversaries.  Adversaries  that  may  not 
exist  for  many  of  the  other  hazardous  materials  that  are  trans-
ported daily would possibly be interested in these shipments. Yucca 
Mountain  will  necessitate  the  movement  of  large  numbers  of  ship-
ments  over  an  extended  period  of  time.  It  allows  the  adversary  to 
chart  the  movement  of  these  shipments  in  a  predictable  way.  It  is 
exacerbated  by  choices  that  agencies  like  the  DOE  makes.  For  ex-
ample, decisions to allow hotter fuel to be shipped may increase the 
radiological  consequences  of  an  attack.  And  it  will  entail  lengthy 
shipment  routes  that  average  over  2,000  miles  since  many  of  the 
shipment origin sites are east of the Mississippi. 

The  safety  and  security  program  that  DOE  will  need  to  engage 
in for Yucca Mountain must face one fact. The shipments will pro-
vide this target-rich environment, which means we need to consider 
the  totality  of  the  shipment  routes  as  the  battle  space,  the 
attackers as potential adversaries with their choice of weapons and 
tactics,  the  shipments  themselves  as  poorly  defended,  high-value, 
symbolic  targets,  and  the  perpetuation  of  an  attack  against  these 
shipments being a highly symbolic statement by the adversaries. 

Spent  nuclear  fuel  is  safe  where  it  exists.  Placing  them  in  the 
transportation corridors increases risk from a variety of means, ac-
cidents,  human-initiated  events,  and  so  on.  And  it  would  be  better 
to  shelter  them  in  place  until  such  time  that  we  have  better  op-
tions. 

Point  number  two.  There  are  a  series  of  existing  issues  that 
many  of  the  panelists  have  alluded  to  and  I  would  like  to  summa-
rize for the panel. 

First  of  all,  shipping  older  fuel  first  is  a  primary  consideration 

that we should insist on. 

Second, shipments should be mostly rail, but truck shipments are 
necessary to complete the task given the physical limitations of the 
origin sites and the current physical limitations of Yucca Mountain.

We need to use dual-purpose casks, dedicated trains. 
We  need  to  conduct  full-scale  cask  testing,  not  just  regulatory 

testing, but extra-regulatory testing. 

We need to engage in a meaningful national level transportation 
NEPA  process,  including  the  selection  of  a  rail  spur,  if  that  is  the 
decision to go ahead with for Yucca Mountain. 

We need to use the WEIB ‘‘straw man’’ routing process. 
We need to start the section 180(c) program rulemaking. 
We need to allow for State regulatory enhancements both for the 

safety but also public perception. 

We  need  to  rethink  the  assumptions  about  terrorism  and  sabo-

tage in light of 9/11. 

These issues constitute the most basic foundations for the devel-
opment of a preferred transportation system. Since today’s hearing 
is  directly  related  to  the  last  issue,  the  balance  of  this  testimony 
will deal with that. 

So,  point  three,  human-initiated  events  and  systematic  risk  as-
sessment  looking  at  these  from  a  different  perspective.  The  sabo-
tage-related  attacks  in  areas  evaluated  in  NRC  and  DOE  analyses 
have changed little over the decades and assume a single spent fuel 
shipping cask is attacked at one location by one group of attackers 
and  typically  using  one  weapon.  The  basic  analyses  also  assumed 
that  the  attack  breaches  the  cask  and  releases  a  small  fraction  of 
the  contents.  The  threat  environment  has  changed  since  the  start 
of  the  Yucca  Mountain  debates  decades  ago.  Yet,  DOE  has  failed 
to adopt an alternative perspective on the risk of these attacks. 

They can engage in a different process to identify those risks and 
perhaps  bring  them  into  the  regulatory  framework.  First  and  fore-
most,  we  need  to  engage  in  a  meta-analysis  of  the  risk  as  defined 
across  the  world.  Second,  we  need  to  develop  a  systematic,  multi- 
level  assessment  process  for  these  risks.  That  includes  existing 
methodologies  like  security  surveys,  risk  management  techniques, 
the design basis threat, but most importantly, we need to consider 
the use of adversarial vulnerability assessments. 

One  critical  omission  for  all  three  of  the  techniques  I  just  men-
tioned  is  to  bring  the  motives,  mind  set,  and  creativity  of  the  ad-
versary  into  the  risk  equation.  To  accomplish  that  task,  we  need 
to  do  a  mental  coordinate  transformation.  This  means  that  when 
assessing the risk for spent nuclear fuel transportation and the in-
frastructure to move that material, it is necessary to think like the 
perpetrators,  not  like  security  professionals,  not  like  energy  com-
pany  officials,  and  not  like  oversight  agencies.  AVA  is  one  proven 
method that can help accomplish that task. 

When  we  are  done  with  this,  using  all  four  of  these  techniques, 
we  can  create  a  matrix  of  potential  threats  against  these  ship-
ments.  In  my  written  testimony,  there  is  a  mock  matrix  that  we 
can refer to. 

Take-aways from today, or a conclusion. 
Point  number  one,  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  is  risky  and 
will  present  a  target-rich  environment  for  our  adversaries.  The 
shipments are symbolically important and represent a radiological-
ly  significant  target.  The  solution  is  to  shelter  the  shipments  in 
place at their sites of origin. As noted by the NRC, energy industry

55 

officials,  and  others,  they  are  safe  and  secure  at  those  facilities. 
Why expose these wastes to risk if we do not have to? 

Point  number  two,  DOE  has  systematically  neglected  to  address 
the  laundry  list  of  concerns  brought  forth  by  stakeholders.  These 
actions increase the likelihood of attacks, the consequences of those 
attacks,  and  the  resultant  social  dislocations  if  these  attacks  suc-
ceed. The solution here is to compel the DOE to engage in a mean-
ingful,  national  level  NEPA  process  that  addresses  these  stake-
holder  concerns  and  that  will  be  documented  over  the  decades  of 
Yucca Mountain transportation. 

Last  point,  DOE,  in  consultation  with  stakeholders,  should  en-
gage in a systematic assessment of risk using the AVA process. The 
solution here is just to do this and will allow the DOE to avoid the 
potentially fatal flaw of being reactive to threats and become more 
proactive  in  relationship  to  human-initiated  events.  In  the  post-9/ 
11  world,  almost  all  Federal  agencies  with  a  significant  homeland 
security role have had to rethink their assumptions on how best to 
serve  the  public  interest.  The  DOE  must  likewise  abandon  the  en-
gineering-based bureaucratic paradigm they hold dear to reconsider 
how  to  identify  risk  from  the  perceptions  and  ideas  of  the  adver-
sary. 

In  conclusion,  Yucca  Mountain  transport  is  risky,  movement  of 
radioactive  materials  potentially  dangerous,  and  failing  to  recog-
nize human-initiated events in a post-9/11 world can be deadly. Al-
ternatives exist, alternatives like shelter-in-place, truly listening to 
the stakeholders, and using systematic risk analysis. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Introduction 

Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  ask-
ing me to testify at these hearings. My name is Dr. James David Ballard and I am 
currently  employed  as  an  Associate  Professor  of  Sociology  at  California  State  Uni-
versity,  Northridge  (CSUN).1 As  part  of  my  academic  appointment  I  am  also  the 
campus  director  for  the  ODNI  funded  Intelligence  Community  Center  for  Academic 
Excellence  (IC–CAE)  program.2 In  an  effort  toward  full  disclosure,  you  should  also 
know  that  I  have  had  an  on-going  relationship  as  a  consultant  to  the  state  of  Ne-
vada Agency for Nuclear Projects (NANP) since 1995.3 

Over the last fourteen years I have been privileged to specialize in studying issues 
associated  with  human  initiated  events,  defined  as  terrorism,  sabotage,  etc.  that 
may  impact  transportation  efforts  for  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  shipments  of 
spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high level radioactive wastes (HLRW). The statements 
made today reflect my own individual opinions and are not necessarily those of any 
of  these  institutions  I  am  associated  with,  nor  do  my  comments  necessarily  reflect 
the opinions of my co-authors, research teams and/or colleagues. 

The foundations of my testimony arise from fourteen years of study on the issues 
surrounding  potential  terrorist  attacks  against  shipments.  During  that  time  I  have 
been  privileged  to  be  part  of  several  multi-disciplinary  teams  of  researchers  that 
have  studied  the  risk  of  terrorism  attacks  on  nuclear  waste  shipments  to  the  pro-
posed  Yucca  Mountain  storage  facility.4 In  particular,  we  as  a  body  of  scholars, 
study  the  changing  nature  of  terrorism  and  the  terrorist  tactics  that  could  be  em-
ployed against radioactive waste shipments. As part of this on-going effort we have 
identified a range of risks associated with transportation of these materials. On two

previous occasions I have testified before the House/Senate on the issues we discuss 
today.5 

I appreciate the opportunity to brief this body on our work regarding the potential 
of  terrorism  attacks  against  the  shipments  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  (SNF)  and  high- 
level radioactive wastes (HLRW) that may be sent to the proposed Yucca Mountain 
facility.  I  hope  the  following  discussion  will  help  you  and  the  agencies  involved  in 
regulating  the  potential  shipments  to  better  understand  the  value  of  a  social  sci-
entific  perspective  on  SNF  transportation.  I  will  begin  by  discussing  an  issue  that 
has been neglected in the debates since it was introduced nearly 10 years ago—the 
target  rich  environment  that  these  shipments  represent.  Second,  I  will  concen-
trating  on  several  other  pressing  issues  not  yet  addressed  in  any  adequate  form  by 
the  DOE  relative  to  the  Yucca  Mountain  project.  Following  this  summary  of  ne-
glected  issues,  this  testimony  will  offer  a  systematic  risk  assessment  protocol  that 
can  help  overcome  some  of  the  deficiencies  that  the  DOE  has  in  their  DEIS,  EIS 
and  SEIS  documents,  one  critical  basis  of  their  planning  efforts  to  date  on  Yucca 
Mountain shipments. Last, this presentation will suggest several ways that you may 
wish  to  review  the  transportation  planning  from  an  alternative  perspective  than 
that  presented  by  the  DOE.  These  alternatives  are  a  way  you  may  gain  insightful 
evidence into the terrorism related threats these shipments face. 
Target Rich Environment 

The DOE has for decades tried to find a way to manage the terrorism risks associ-
ated with the proposed Yucca Mountain project with little overall programmatic suc-
cess.  Over  that  extended  time-frame  the  expenditures  of  rate  payer  and  taxpayer 
funding  for  this  agency  and  its  efforts  have  produced  some  less  than  stellar  social 
scientific  results  with  respect  to  the  risks  of  human  initiated  events.  Make  no  mis-
take,  what  we  take  about  when  discussing  the  transport  of  SNF  and  HLRW  ship-
ments  are  potentially  very  dangerous  cargos  and  highly  symbolic  targets.  They  are 
a  danger  to  the  transportation  infrastructure,  to  the  public  health  and  to  the  long 
term  economic  viability  of  the  location(s)  where  an  accident  and/or  terrorist  attack 
may transpire. This is a social fact, no matter the rhetoric used by the industry and/ 
or  DOE  to  obscure  this  reality.  Listen  carefully  to  what  is  said  and  ask  yourselves 
if it designed to obscure the issues from law makers, the public and the many stake-
holders who are concerned about the shipment campaign necessary to stock the pro-
posed Yucca repository. 

In  contrast  to  the  DOE  and  nuclear  industry  perspectives,  what  the  critics  say 
is  typically  designed  to  see  any  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  program  conducted 
in a manner consistent with NEPA requirements. That is, the suggestions made by 
these critics compel the DOE to follow the spirit and letter of this law when looking 
at the transportation planning for this particular large scale Federal program. 

One  critical  issue  typically  neglected  by  the  DOE  is  the  recognition  of  this  ship-
ment  campaign  as  a  danger  to  the  public.  In  other  words,  any  Yucca  Mountain 
transportation program that becomes necessary to transport the Nation’s stockpiles 
of  highly  radioactive  waste  is  a  security  risk  in  and  of  itself.  What  DOE  seemingly 
fails to understand is that this large scale Federal program will draw the attention 
of  a  wide  variety  of  adversaries  because  of  its  symbolic  value—briefly  it  is  nuclear, 
it  is  Federal  and  it  is  controversial.  The  choice  of  a  geographic  location  far  distant 
from  the  production  sites  where  SNF  and  HLRW  are  generated  assists  the  adver-
saries since it: 

way. 

• Necessitates the movement of large numbers of shipments. 
• Allows for the adversary to chart movement of these shipments in a predictable 
• Is exacerbated by choices the DOE makes. For example, decisions that allow for 
hotter  fuel,  thus  higher  potential  harm,  to  be  sent  along  these  predictable  cor-
ridors. 
• Will  entail  lengthy  shipment  routes  that  average  over  2,000  miles  of  open,  un-

protected terrain where an adversary can pick and choose the attack site. 

Collectively  these  and  other  avoidable/manageable  risks  can  be  discussed  as  con-
stituting  a  target  rich  environment.6 The  idea  of  a  target  rich  environment  is  de-
rived from military parlance. In this case we should consider: 

• The totality of the shipment routes as the battle space. 
• The attackers as potential adversaries with their choice of weapons and tactics. 
• The shipments themselves as poorly defended, high value, symbolic targets. 
• The  perpetration  of  an  attack  against  these  shipments  being  a  highly  symbolic 

statement by the adversaries.

Under  this  definitional  schema  the  DOE’s  transportation  choices  become  increas-
ingly  important.  This  issue  alone  may  suggest  that  sheltering  the  wastes  in  place,7 
at  their  point  of  origin,  may  be  a  more  optimal  safety  and  security  strategy  since 
the  highly  radioactive  wastes  will  be  protected  from  entering  the  target  rich  envi-
ronmental battle space. The next section of this testimony reviews ten more critical 
issues  that  should  prompt  reconsideration  by  this  body  when  deliberating  the  logic 
of the Yucca Mountain project and its potential to present a target rich environment 
to adversaries, both foreign and domestic. 
Pressing Issues 

Recently  Nevada  summarized  a  top  ten  list  of  issues  of  concern  during  a  presen-
tation at the foremost nuclear industry conference, Waste Management 2008.8 Since 
enactment of the NWPAA, and adoption of Assembly Concurrent Resolution 8 by the 
Nevada Legislature in 1987, NANP has consistently made recommendations to DOE 
regarding transportation safety and security, including many in this listing. The top 
ten measures are summarized below. 

1. Ship the Oldest Fuel First. Nevada has recommended that DOE ship the old-
est  SNF  first.  This  recommendation  is  supported  by  NAS  and  GAO  since  they 
also  recommend  shipping  older  fuel  first.  For  example,  shipping  SNF  that  has 
been  ‘‘aged’’  50  years  out  of  reactor,  compared  to  shipping  5-year-cooled  SNF, 
could  reduce  radiological  hazards  significantly  and  assist  in  lowering  the  risks 
of human initiated events. 
2. Shipments should be by Rail. Nevada has recommended that DOE utilize rail 
as  the  preferred  mode  of  transportation,  while  acknowledging  the  serious  im-
pediments  to  developing  rail  access  to  Yucca  Mountain  and  from  24  of  the  76 
shipping  sites.  Based  on  shipping  site  current  capabilities,  the  share  of  SNF 
that could realistically be shipped by rail may be 65–75 percent, not the 90 per-
cent  projected  by  DOE.  Thus,  DOE  must  first  admit  to  the  realities  of  the  pro-
posed  shipment  campaign  and  start  planning  for  large  numbers  of  truck  ship-
ments  under  the  ‘‘mostly  rail’’  shipment  scenario.  This  would  entail  a  serious 
reconsideration  of  the  safety  and  security  requirements  necessary  to  protect 
shipments. 
3. Use Dual-Purpose Casks. Nevada has recommended that DOE base its trans-
portation  system  on  use  of  dual-purpose  (transportable/storage)  casks  of  a 
standardized design, with a range of capacities resulting in loaded cask weights 
of  about  125,  100,  and  70  tons.  In  1995,  Nevada  endorsed  a  previous  DOE 
transportation  plan  that  would  have  used  a  multi-purpose  canister  (MPC)  sys-
tem  for  transport  and  storage.  DOE’s  current  proposal  to  use  the  TAD  (Trans-
port, Aging and Disposal) canister system does not fully address this issue. This 
operational  choice  by  the  DOE  may  actually  complicate  and  further  constrain 
the transportation system. 
4.  Use  Dedicated  Trains.  Nevada  has  recommended  that  DOE  use  dedicated 
trains for all rail shipments. Until DOE commits to only using dedicated trains, 
DOE routing studies and risk analyses must evaluate use of both dedicated and 
general  freight  rail  shipments.  This  policy  choice  by  the  DOE  adds  to  the  com-
plexity  of  any  analysis,  but  more  importantly  without  the  commitment  of  dedi-
cated  trains,  the  safety  and  security  of  shipments  may  be  compromised  since 
securing  SNF/HLRW  shipments  in  general  freight  poses  significant  challenges 
and greatly increases the risk of terrorism or sabotage during transport. 
5.  Commit  to  Meaningful  Cask  Testing.  Nevada  has  recommended  that  DOE 
and/or NRC conduct a meaningful full scale cask testing program. DOE or NRC 
should  conduct  full-scale  regulatory  tests  on  each  cask  design  (or  in  cases  of 
similar designs, test one cask from each representative grouping). DOE or NRC 
should  also  conduct  a  combination  of  extra-regulatory,  full-scale  testing,  scale 
model  testing,  component  testing,  and  computer  simulations  to  determine  cask 
failure thresholds. In addition, DOE and/or NRC must ensure meaningful stake-
holder  participation  in  all  aspects  of  the  cask  testing  program.  Last,  DOE  and/ 
or  NRC  should  also  couple  this  testing  with  new  insights  into  the  potential  for 
human  initiated  events  like  sabotage  and  terrorism  (extra  regulatory  testing). 
Understanding  the  potential  releases  from  casks  that  could  result  from  a 
human  initiated  event  rests  on  knowing  how  these  casks  react  to  a  variety  of 
attack conditions. 
6.  Use  a  meaningful  NEPA  process  for  all  transportation  activities.  Nevada  has 
recommended  that  DOE  use  a  credible  National  Environmental  Policy  Act 
(NEPA)  process  to  select  a  preferred  Yucca  Mountain  rail  access  corridor  and 
rail  alignment  in  Nevada.  Likewise  the  DOE  should  be  compelled  to  imme-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

58 

diately  conduct  a  national  level  transportation  specific  NEPA  document.  This 
seems  to  be  a  necessary,  sufficient,  logical  and  warranted  step  given  the  con-
sequences of attacks and the need for states input on such transportation deci-
sions.  As  the  end  point  of  a  national  transportation  program,  the  proposed  Ne-
vada  rail  corridor  is  critical  in  the  overall  performance  of  the  Yucca  planning, 
so  articulation  of  that  plan  prior  to  consideration  of  the  rail  spur  makes  policy 
sense. The safety and security challenges that arise from building an extensive 
rail  spur  into  the  Yucca  facility  demand  a  robust  dialogue  on  the  issues,  one 
that NEPA requires and to date DOE seems unwilling to offer any realistic ap-
proaches to studying. 
7.  WEIB  ‘‘Straw  man’’  Shipment  Routes.  Nevada  has  recommended  that  DOE 
select  routes  for  the  national  transportation  system  using  a  reasonable  trans-
portation methodology developed by stakeholders. Transportation safety and se-
curity require that DOE first plan what routes will be used so that meaningful 
stakeholder  input  can  be  focused  on  the  planning.  The  DOE  should  follow  a 
three-step process proposed by the Western Interstate Energy Board (WIEB): 

a.  DOE  would  designate  ‘‘straw  man’’  routes,  preferably  in  a  national  level 
transportation NEPA document. 
b.  Member  states  would  individually  and  collectively  evaluate  the  DOE 
routes, and then designate preferred routes on a regional basis. 
c.  DOE  would  then  formally  adopt  the  routes  selected  by  WIEB,  and  des-
ignate  these  routes  (allowing  exceptions  for  use  of  designated  alternative 
routes  in  emergency  situations)  in  DOE  contracts  with  rail  and  highway 
carriers. 

8.  Start  the  Section  180(c)  process.  Nevada  has  recommended  that  DOE  imple-
ment  the  transportation  planning  and  emergency  response  training  program, 
required under Section 180 (c) of the NWPAA, through formal rulemaking. Ab-
sent  rulemaking,  the  State  of  Nevada  believes  that  congressional  action  might 
be needed to implement the program, as was the case with the Waste Isolation 
Pilot  Plant  (WIPP)  DOE-State  cooperative  transportation  planning  program. 
The connection to safety and security is especially important here, without sys-
tems of well funded emergency response training the transportation program is 
seriously  flawed.  One  of  the  critical  safety  and  security  issues  states  would  be 
facing  is  this  program  becoming  an  unfunded  Federal  mandate  that  requires 
them to provide 50 years of training, protection and response capabilities for the 
Yucca  program.  In  terms  of  transportation  program  oversight,  response  capa-
bilities  and  organizational  capacity,  the  proposed  Yucca  program  would  entail 
three  or  perhaps  four  generations  of  emergence  response  professionals,  human 
capital  and  their  institutional  memory,  being  imbued  with  relevant  experience 
and knowledge of the program’s operational parameters. 
9.  Respect  State,  Local,  and  Tribal  Regulation.  Nevada  has  recommended  that 
DOE  support  state  regulatory  enhancements  to  manage  transportation  risks 
and address public perceptions of transportation risks. These would include, but 
not be limited to: 

a.  Port-of-entry  inspections  and  state  escorts  for  DOE  shipments  at  DOE 
expense. 
b. States, in conjunction with local governments, may also impose seasonal, 
day-of-week,  and  time-of-day  restrictions  on  DOE  to  address  unique  local 
conditions. 
c. Tribal governments may also regulate DOE shipments. 

10.  Address  issues  associated  with  Terrorism  and  Sabotage.  Nevada  has  rec-
ommended that DOE address acts of sabotage and terrorism against repository 
shipments.  DOE  has  acknowledged,  in  the  Final  EIS  for  Yucca  Mountain,  the 
potential  vulnerability  of  shipments  to  such  attacks.  Analyses  by  Nevada  con-
tractors  have  concluded  that  the  releases  and  consequences  could  be  many 
times  greater  than  reported  by  the  DOE,  resulting  in  catastrophic  cleanup  and 
recovery  costs.  NRC  has  likewise  neglected  its  mandate  as  a  regulatory  body 
with respect to this issue. Specifically: 

a. DOE needs to systematically address terrorism issues and risks in devel-
opment of repository transportation operational protocols. 
b. NRC has yet to respond to the specific terrorism risks and impacts docu-
mented in Nevada’s 1999 petition for rulemaking (Docket PRM 73–10).

Since today’s hearing is directly related to the last issue of concern, the next sec-
tion  of  this  presentation  will  offer  a  methodology  that  could  be  used  by  the  DOE, 
if it proceeds with the Yucca project, to assess and mitigate the risks of human initi-
ated  events  like  terrorism,  sabotage,  large  scale  protests  and  similar  risk  inducing 
events. 
Human-Initiated Events and Systematic Risk Assessment 

Given  stakeholder  concerns  and  the  threat  of  terrorism,  this  testimony  rec-
ommends the development of a comprehensive human initiated event threat assess-
ment process for the proposed Yucca Mountain transportation system.9 This process 
could  be  used  by  DOE  to  assess  repository  transportation  impacts  as  part  of  its 
NEPA  requirements,  and  in  responding  to  the  Western  Governors  Association 
(WGA) resolution on terrorism and sabotage. 

The following discussion identifies ways to improve current risk assessment tech-
niques  to  meet  the  challenges  of  human  initiated  events,  including  terrorism,  sabo-
tage, induced or deliberate accidents, and violent protests. The recommended threat 
assessment  process  is  presented  as  a  series  of  industry  standard  methods  and  con-
cludes  with  exemplar  scenarios.  The  testimony  is  based  only  on  open  source  data 
to develop these ideas, concepts and methodologies.10 
Shipment Vulnerability Debate 

For  three  decades,  risk  analysts  have  debated  the  vulnerability  of  spent  nuclear 
fuel shipments to acts of terrorism and sabotage. The details of the debates are doc-
umented in studies prepared for the State of Nevada in 1998 and 2005.11 The sabo-
tage related attack scenarios evaluated in NRC and DOE analyses have changed lit-
tle  over  the  decades.  The  DOE/NRC  analyses  assume  that  a  single  spent  fuel  ship-
ping  cask  is  attacked  at  one  location,  by  one  group  of  attackers,  using  one  weapon. 
The  basic  analyses  assume  that  the  attack  breaches  the  cask  and  releases  a  small 
fraction of the contents. In general the agency sponsored analyses differ in estimates 
of  the  amount  of  radioactive  material  released,  the  details  of  the  release  and  dis-
persal, the area contaminated, the population exposed, the resulting human casual-
ties and the economic impacts. 

The  first  NRC  regulations  requiring  physical  protection  of  spent  fuel  shipments 
were issued in response to a 1977 draft assessment by Sandia National Laboratories 
(SNL). That assessment, and a follow-up study by SNL in 1980, indicated that sabo-
tage  of  a  shipment  in  an  urban  area  could  cause  hundreds  to  thousands  of  casual-
ties, and billions of dollars in economic losses and cleanup costs.12 The NRC issued 
interim  physical  protection  requirements  for  spent  fuel  shipments  in  1979,  and 
adopted the current system of regulations (10CFR73.37) by rulemaking in 1980. 

Subsequent  studies  sponsored  by  NRC  and  DOE  sharply  reduced  the  estimated 
causalities  and  economic  losses  from  this  original  scientific  work  product.  The  de-
bate  over  the  consequences  of  a  successful  terrorist  attack  resumed  in  1984,  when 
the  NRC,  acting  on  the  new  sponsored  studies,  issued  a  proposed  rule  eliminating 
physical  protection  requirements  for  most  spent  fuel  shipments.  The  NRC  had  con-
cluded that the expected consequences of a successful attack in ‘‘a heavily populated 
area such as New York City would be no early fatalities and less than one (0.4) la-
tent  cancer  fatality.’’  This  NRC  proposed  rule  was  opposed  by  state  governments, 
environmental  groups  and  some  nuclear  industry  sources.  Three  years  later,  the 
NRC  terminated  the  proposed  rule,  without  explanation.  Throughout  the  1990s, 
however,  the  NRC  continued  to  downplay  attack  consequences.  At  the  same  time, 
public discussion of vulnerability and consequences temporarily subsided. 

The  controversy  re-emerged  nationally  in  1995  as  the  DOE  began  the  NEPA 
scoping  process  for  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  geologic  repository.  State  govern-
ments and other parties urged DOE to more directly address terrorism and sabotage 
in the Yucca Mountain environmental impact statement (EIS). In its role as a stake-
holder,  the  state  of  Nevada  filed  detailed  scoping  comments  on  the  impacts  of  ter-
rorism  against  repository  shipments  during  1995,  and  published  several  supporting 
studies between 1996 and 1998. Based on these studies, Nevada’s Attorney General 
filed  a  petition  for  rulemaking  with  the  NRC  in  June  1999.  The  Nevada  petition 
documented the vulnerability of shipping casks, and argued that shipments to a na-
tional  repository  would  create  greater  opportunities  for  terrorist  attacks  and  sabo-
tage.  The  petition,  which  requested  strengthening  of  the  current  regulations  and  a 
comprehensive reexamination of radiological sabotage, was endorsed by the Western 
Governor’s  Association  (WGA).  More  than  8  years  later,  the  NRC  has  still  not  offi-
cially responded to the Nevada petition. 

DOE  acknowledged  that  shipping  casks  are  vulnerable  to  terrorist  attack  in  the 
1999  Draft  EIS  for  Yucca  Mountain.13 In  support  of  the  Draft  EIS,  DOE  sponsored 
a  1999  SNL  study  of  cask  sabotage,  which  demonstrated  that  high-energy  devices 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

60 

(HEDs)  were  ‘‘capable  of  penetrating  a  cask’s  shield  wall,  leading  to  the  dispersal 
of contaminants to the environment.’’ The SNL study also concluded that a success-
ful  attack  on  a  truck  cask  could  release  more  radioactive  materials  than  an  attack 
on  a  rail  cask,  even  though  rail  casks  would  contain,  on  average,  up  to  six  times 
more SNF than truck casks.14 

In  the  2002  Final  EIS  for  Yucca  Mountain,  DOE  updated  its  sabotage  analysis, 
assuming more highly radioactive SNF, a larger respirable release, and a higher fu-
ture  average  population  density  for  U.S.  cities.15 In  this  document  the  DOE  esti-
mated that a successful attack on a truck cask in an urbanized area under average 
weather  conditions  would  result  in  a  population  dose  of  96,000  person-rem  and  48 
latent cancer fatalities. For a successful attack on a large rail cask, DOE estimated 
a  population  dose  of  17,000  person-rem  and  9  latent  cancer  fatalities.  In  neither 
case  did  DOE  evaluate  any  environmental  impacts  other  than  health  effects,  and 
ignored  the  social-economic  impacts  of  a  successful  act  of  sabotage.  While  the  DOE 
did not specifically estimate cleanup costs after such an attack, the FEIS states that 
clean-up costs following a worst-case transportation accident could reach $10 billion. 
Analyses prepared for the state of Nevada by Radioactive Waste Management As-
sociates  (RWMA)  calculated  that  sabotage  impacts  could  be  considerably  greater.16 
RWMA  replicated  the  DOE  Final  EIS  sabotage  consequence  analyses,  using  the 
RISKIND  model  for  health  effects  and  the  RADTRAN  model  for  economic  impacts, 
the  SNL  study  average  and  maximum  inventory  release  fractions,  a  range  of  cred-
ible  values  for  the  gap  inventory  of  Cs–137  and  considered  a  range  of  population 
densities and weather conditions. 

RWMA concluded that an attack on a truck cask using the same common military 
demolition device assumed in the DOE analysis could cause 300 to 1,820 latent can-
cer fatalities, assuming 90 percent penetration of the cask by a single blast. For the 
same device used against a large rail cask, RWMA estimated 46 to 253 latent cancer 
fatalities, again assuming 90 percent penetration. The major radiological health im-
pacts of an attack would be caused by the downwind dispersion of respirable mate-
rial  (mainly  particles  with  a  diameter  less  than  10  microns)  that  could  be  ejected 
from  the  damaged  cask.  Depending  upon  the  meteorological  conditions  present  at 
the time of an attack, the respirable aerosol of radioactive materials could affect an 
area  of  10  square  kilometers  (3.9  square  miles)  or  more.  RWMA  estimated  cleanup 
costs  ranging  upward  from  $668  million  for  the  rail  incident,  and  $6.1  billion  for 
the truck incident, to more than $10 billion. Full perforation of the truck cask, likely 
to  occur  in  an  attack  involving  a  state-of-the  art  anti-tank  weapon,  could  cause  as 
many  as  3,000  to  18,000  latent  cancer  fatalities,  and  cleanup  and  recovery  costs 
could far exceed $10 billion. 

In  October  2007,  DOE  published  the  Draft  Supplemental  Environmental  Impact 
Statement  for  Yucca  Mountain  (DSEIS)  and  the  Draft  Rail  Alignment  Environ-
mental  Impact  Statement  (RA  DEIS).17 Both  the  DSEIS  and  the  RA  DEIS  address 
the  impacts  of  sabotage  against  repository  shipments.  In  both  volumes  DOE  states 
that  it  has  ‘‘analyzed  plausible  threat  scenarios,  required  enhanced  security  meas-
ures  to  protect  against  these  threats,  and  developed  emergency  planning  require-
ments that would mitigate potential consequences for certain scenarios. DOE would 
continue  to  modify  its  approach  to  ensuring  safe  and  secure  shipments  of  spent  nu-
clear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, as appropriate, between now and the time 
of  shipments.  For  the  reasons  stated  above,  DOE  believes  that  under  general  cred-
ible  threat  conditions  the  probability  of  a  sabotage  event  that  would  result  in  a 
major  radiological  release  would  be  low’’  (DSEIS,  p.  6–22;  RA  DEIS,  p.  4–314,  em-
phasis added). 

Acknowledging  ‘‘the  uncertainty  inherent  in  the  assessment  of  the  likelihood  of  a 
sabotage  event,’’  the  DSEIS  and  RA  DEIS  evaluated  events  in  which  ‘‘a  modern 
weapon  (high  energy  density  device)’’  is  used  to  ‘‘penetrate  a  spent  nuclear  fuel 
cask.’’ DOE evaluated the consequences of events occurring in representative urban, 
suburban,  and  rural  areas.  Based  on  new  research  by  Luna  (2006) 18 and  on  Euro-
pean  studies,  the  DSEIS  assumed  that  the  single  weapon  attack  studied  would  re-
sult  in  a  smaller  release  of  respirable  material  than  DOE  assumed  in  the  2002 
FEIS.  For  a  sabotage  event  against  a  truck  cask  in  an  urban  area,  the  DSEIS  re-
ports consequences about half what DOE estimated in the 2002 FEIS—a population 
dose of 47,000 person-rem, and 28 latent cancer fatalities. For an attack on a large 
rail cask in an urban area, the DSEIS reports consequences about double what DOE 
estimated in the 2002 FEIS—a population dose of 32,000 person-rem, and 19 latent 
cancer fatalities. 

The DSEIS does acknowledge the aforementioned State of Nevada analyses under 
the  heading  ‘‘Transportation  Sabotage:  An  Opposing  Viewpoint.’’  Despite  this  note 
in  the  document,  and  as  in  earlier  DOE  analyses,  the  DSEIS  does  not  provide  spe-
cific information on:

• The land area contaminated. 
• Economic losses due to disruption of normal activities. 
• The cost of cleanup. 
As  of  2008,  the  State  of  Nevada  is  preparing  its  own  detailed  reassessment  of 
transportation  sabotage  impacts.  To  date,  Nevada  has  submitted  comments  on  the 
DSEIS  sabotage  consequence  analyses  (January  10,  2008).  In  those  comments,  Ne-
vada emphasized that the DSEIS continues to ignore the consequences of a terrorist 
attack  using  one  or  more  weapons  that  completely  perforate  the  shipping  cask,  or 
a combination of weapons specifically designed to breach, damage, and disperse the 
cask contents. Such an attack could result in impacts more severe than those evalu-
ated by DOE. 

The new DOE-sponsored research does not address such impacts. In fact, the Ven-
turi effect created by full perforation of a shipping cask would likely negate the re-
duction  in  impacts  claimed  in  the  Luna  (2006)  study.  In  its  key  conclusion,  DOE 
asserts  that  the  factors  identified  by  the  State  of  Nevada  ‘‘could  affect  the  chances 
of success but not the outcome of the sabotage event.’’ 19 DOE presents no evidence 
in the DSEIS, the RA DEIS, or any of the cited references to support that assertion. 
Moreover,  the  DSEIS  ignores  evidence,  including  terrorism  studies  funded  by 
DOE, that this agency’s activities may be particularly attractive symbolic targets for 
sabotage  or  terrorist  attacks.  The  DSEIS  also  ignores  past  instances  in  which 
human  errors  in  cask  fabrication  and  cask  loading  actually  occurred  during  NRC- 
licensed  shipments,  and  created  conditions  that  could  have  compromised  cask  per-
formance  in  the  event  of  a  sabotage  event.  Likewise,  the  DSEIS  ignores  Nevada’s 
argument  that  unique  local  conditions  such  as  proximity  of  the  existing  mainline 
railroads  to  urban  location  like  downtown  Las  Vegas  and  Reno-Sparks  must  be 
factored  into  consequence  assessments,  resulting  in  potential  multi-billion  dollar 
cleanup costs and business disruption impacts. 

In  summary,  all  of  the  consequence  assessments  so  far  conducted  by  NRC,  DOE 
and the State of Nevada assumed single-phase attack scenarios. None of these con-
sequence  assessments  have  evaluated  the  effects  of  an  attack  involving  the  simple 
impact-exacerbating  tactics  identified  by  the  U.S.  Army  peer  review  report  more 
than  two  decades  ago:  namely  the  combined  use  of  a  breaching  device  and  a  dis-
persal  device,  or  use  of  multiple  breaching  devices.  None  of  these  consequence  as-
sessments  have  incorporated  insights  obtained  from  the  1998  testing  sponsored  by 
International  Fuel  Containers,  Incorporated,  at  the  U.S.  Army  Aberdeen  Test  Cen-
ter in which a newer generation weapon, a TOW II warhead, was used. Most signifi-
cantly,  none  of  these  consequence  assessments  have  evaluated  any  of  the  impact- 
exacerbating tactics studied by counter-terrorism experts in the post-9/11 threat en-
vironment.  Credible  hijack  and  control  scenarios,  specialized  truck  bomb  scenarios, 
and/or concealed weapons like IED’s (improvised roadside devices), coupled with in-
sider assistance, diversionary attacks, and/or suicide tactics, could potentially result 
in  radiological  consequences  far  greater  than  those  previously  estimated  by  NRC, 
DOE or the State of Nevada.20 
WGA Resolution 

The  primary  motivation  for  this  suggest  analytical  format,  prior  to  publication  of 
the  DOE’s  DSEIS,  was  the  WGA  resolution  regarding  Yucca  Mountain  transpor-
tation. The WGA represents nineteen Western states and three territories. The asso-
ciation  allows  state  political  leaders  to  address  critical  policy  issues  in  a  wide  vari-
ety  of  areas.  The  WGA  organization  thus  helps  state  leaders  develop  strategies  to 
address  complex  issues  facing  western  states.21 WGA  has  been  actively  involved  in 
nuclear waste transportation planning for two decades. In 2007, WGA renewed and 
revised a policy resolution (07–2) on the risks of terrorism and sabotage against re-
pository  shipments.22 The  original  resolution  behind  this  new  document  had  been 
adopted in 1998. 

WGA Resolution 07–2 notes that in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 ter-
rorist attacks, the altered threat environment calls for new, more comprehensive ter-
rorism  assessment  tools.  The  resolution  calls  upon  the  NRC  to  ‘‘fully  address  the 
consequences  of  attacks  against  all  components  of  the  nuclear  waste  handling  and 
transport system, to include: attacks against transportation infrastructure, the theft 
of a shipment, use of high-energy explosives against a shipment cask, and direct at-
tacks against a shipment cask using antitank missiles or other armament that could 
cause a loss of containment.’’ WGA further requests that NRC ‘‘strengthen its efforts 
to  share  information  with  state  and  local  governments  regarding  spent  fuel  ship-
ment  vulnerabilities  and  consequences,  ‘‘  recognizing  that  ‘‘sharing  of  information 
must  be  conducted  within  the  framework  of  preventing  the  release  of  sensitive  or 
classified information to individuals without a need to know.’’

The  WGA  resolution  notes  that  DOE  has  acknowledged  the  vulnerability  of  ship-
ments  in  the  2002  Final  EIS  for  Yucca  Mountain.  The  resolution  states:  ‘‘DOE 
should  continue  to  address  acts  of  sabotage  and  terrorism  in  its  NEPA  documents, 
and  should  incorporate  terrorism/sabotage  risk  management  and  countermeasures 
in  all  DOE  transportation  plans,  protocols,  and  practices  relating  to  operation  of  a 
repository,  interim  storage  facility,  and/or  intermodal  transfer  facility,  including  li-
ability  for  costs  and  damages  resulting  from  terrorism/sabotage  against  nuclear 
waste  shipments.  DOE  should  share  security-related  information  with  state  and 
local governments to the maximum extent practicable.’’ 23 
Comprehensive Threat Assessment 

Driven by regulations and the need to protect the public from catastrophic events, 
the  nuclear  industry  has  a  continuous  quality  improvement  process  for  security 
against human-initiated events. The two recently issued DOE NEPA documents, the 
Draft Supplemental EIS and the Draft Rail Alignment EIS, employ only some of the 
methods  used  by  the  industry  to  protect  fixed  assets  like  reactors,  but  the  not  ex-
pressly  documented  analytical  method  employed  by  DOE  for  the  Yucca  Mountain 
transportation effort does not use state-of-the-art assessment techniques, nor does the 
assessment effort meet industry standards for fixed site security. 

The  problem  with  the  DOE’s  approach  to  the  NEPA  documents  (SEIS’s)  is  two- 
fold:  How  to  assess  the  threat  of  human-initiated  events  against  spent  fuel  ship-
ments to Yucca Mountain nationally, and second, for the proposed Caliente rail line 
in Nevada. Once again, human initiated events refer to the range of malevolent acts 
that  could  be  perpetrated  on  the  shipments—including  such  events  as  terrorism, 
sabotage,  deliberate  accidents  and  violent  protest  movements.24 Shipments  refer  to 
the  various  means  that  will  be  used  to  move  SNF  and  HLRW  into  the  national 
transportation  system/proposed  Caliente  rail  corridor  from  their  current  storage  fa-
cilities  at  commercial  nuclear  power  plants,  DOE  weapons  production  sites,  and 
from other DOE serviced/regulated/owned source facilities. 

This  presentation  recommends  specific  and  detailed  methodologies  that  are  used 
in  social  science  and  industry  that,  that  taken  together,  could  constitute  a  com-
prehensive  threat  assessment  for  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  sys-
tem: 

• The  identification  of  relevant  human-initiated  events  by  use  of  Meta  analysis. 
• Development  of  a  systematic  multi-level  assessment  of  human-initiated  event 
• A  resultant  matrix  of  human  initiated  events  and  attack  scenario  exemplars 

risks for the transportation modes, facilities, corridors, etc. 

suitable for DOE study and consideration in NEPA documentation. 

Human-initiated Events 

Several  large  categories  of  human-initiated  events  can  be  identified  across  the 
major  components  of  the  transportation  system  and  relative  to  the  known  or  ex-
pected  characteristics  of  the  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  system.  These  include 
terrorism, sabotage, accidents and protests.25 The table below lists these four event 
categories  and  notes  how  they  may  apply  to  the  four  major  transportation  compo-
nents  derived  from  the  DOE  ‘‘Transportation  Concept  of  Operations’’  and  DOE 
‘‘Draft National Transportation Plan’’.26

Terrorism  attacks  are  defined  here  as  those  malevolent  actions  that  are  designed 
to  cause  significant  symbolic  events,  a  significant  incident  that  acts  as  a  statement 
in opposition to the shipments or an act that directly attacks the transports, casks, 
facilities for handling shipment casks or the personnel that are involved in the four 
categories  of  transportation  infrastructure  noted  above.  These  terrorism  acts  will 
range on a continuum from symbolic events that are not intended to result in a re-
lease  of  radioactive  materials  all  the  way  up  to  sophisticated  full-scale  assaults  de-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

63 

signed to release/disperse the casks radioactive contents. These attacks may be mo-
tivated  by  a  political/social/religious  agenda,  attacks  prompted  by  an  anti-Federal 
government  agenda,  attacks  based  on  the  deliberate  creation  of  economic  disloca-
tions  in  the  energy  sector,  or  attacks  that  are  inspired  by  a  social  issue.  These  at-
tacks  may  be  perpetrated  by  foreign  nationals,  American  citizens,  or  any  combina-
tion of the two. 

Sabotage is defined herein as those malevolent activities that could interfere with 
the safe and secure loading/unloading and transportation of the nuclear wastes. Ex-
amples may include the use of insider information, employee tampering with casks, 
large  scale  labor  problems,  and/or  deliberate  contamination  of  casks/transports  to 
delay  shipments.  Sabotage  can  also  be  defined  as  activities  detrimental  to  the  safe 
and  secure  transport  of  these  materials.  Sabotage  acts  will  also  exist  on  a  con-
tinuum from attacks not intended to damage a cask up to an act designed to release/ 
disperse the inventory of radionuclides. The motives for such attacks are considered 
to be the same as for the terrorist attacks and acts of sabotage may be perpetrated 
by the same range of adversaries. 

Deliberate Accidents are defined here as those malevolent human-initiated events 
that  result  in  endangerment  of  the  shipments,  their  casks,  or  the  overall  shipment 
campaign.  These  may  come  from  deliberate  acts  by  an  individual  or  small  group 
interfering  with  shipment  operations  and  from  negligent  acts  of  those  within  the 
transportation  system  that  can  create  a  potential,  minimal  or  significant  release  of 
the  highly  radioactive  contents.  Like  terrorism  and  sabotage,  these  acts  will  also 
exist  on  a  continuum  from  attacks  not  intended  to  damage  a  cask  up  to  an  act  de-
signed  to  release  the  inventory  of  radionuclides.  The  motives  are  considered  to  be 
the  same  as  for  the  terrorist  attacks  and  they  may  be  perpetrated  by  the  range  of 
adversaries. 

Violent  Protests  are  defined  as  those  potentially  malevolent  activities  that  could 
interfere  with  the  safe  and  secure  transportation  of  the  nuclear  wastes.  These  pro-
tests may also be used as a rouse to hide the intentions of malicious actors who seek 
to commit acts of terrorism or sabotage by hiding their actions in the larger protest 
group. This category is included to recognize the fact that these shipments will face 
significant  opposition  from  protesters,  based  on  the  experiences  of  other  shipment 
campaigns around the world. Such large scale protests may endanger the shipments 
and/or public health by delaying shipments and increasing routine doses to the pop-
ulation.  These  acts  will  also  exist  on  a  continuum  from  collective  acts  not  intended 
to  damage  a  cask  up  to  an  act  designed  to  release  the  inventory  of  radionuclides. 
The  motives  for  such  attacks  are  considered  to  be  the  same  as  for  the  terrorist  at-
tacks and they may be perpetrated by the same range of adversaries. 
Threat Assessment Process 

A range of threat assessment procedures should be conducted prior to commence-
ment  of  shipments  and  continued  during  the  shipping  campaign,  in  a  way  that 
measures risk over time, and enables assessments to be continually updated.27 The 
longitudinal  risks  may  also  need  to  be  assessed  because  of  a  rise  in  energy  related 
terrorism acts,28 and as part of the on-going DOE obligation to operate under proce-
dures equivalent to the NRC physical protection regulations (10CFR73.37), although 
DOE is not necessarily subject to these particular NRC regulations. 
Meta-threat analysis 

The  analysis-in-depth  suggested  herein  starts  with  consideration  of  a  wide  range 
of potential threats and consequences vis-a`-vis shipments. Such a systematic assess-
ment  would  first  involve  an  exhaustive  meta-analysis  of  the  literature  relative  to 
attacks on shipments of hazardous materials, including SNF and HLRW. This proc-
ess  would  need  to  account  for  emerging  threats  and  tactics  being  employed  by  ter-
rorists/adversaries  around  the  globe.  It  would  also  include  IAEA  (2007)  guidance 
documents on the subject and documentation of threats that have arisen in the glob-
al  theater  where  terrorists/adversaries  operate.  This  data  should  then  be  vetted 
with  outside  stakeholders,  not  just  internal  DOE  security  personnel,  to  define  the 
various challenges that the Yucca Mountain transportation effort could face over the 
five  decade  life  span  of  the  proposed  project.  Emerging  from  this  effort  would  be  a 
pro-active  catalogue  of  transportation  risks  and  issues  that  should  inform  a  NEPA 
analysis,  not  just  cherry-picked  scenarios  that  react  to  the  latest  criticisms,  from 
Nevada studies, government analysis and/or those generated by the National Acad-
emy of Sciences.29 
Vulnerability Assessment Process 

Transportation  security  for  a  cargo  as  dangerous  as  the  highly  radioactive  SNF 
and  HLW  should  prompt  planners  to  use  the  best  available  techniques  to  reduce 
threats from human-initiated events. Typically security professionals use four levels

of vulnerability assessment techniques to protect nuclear facilities and other critical 
industrial  applications.30 Each  of  several  techniques  has  strengths  and  weaknesses 
but  with  the  combined  (triangulated)  use  of  all  of  these  techniques,  taken  together 
as a NEPA inspired research strategy, allows for improvements in security and bet-
ter  defines  risks.  That  is,  the  use  of  more  than  one  of  these  offers  a  more  robust 
methodological  approach  to  the  task  at  hand,  all  of  them  allows  for  a  form  of  de-
fense-in-depth, a common principle in nuclear security. 

These four techniques offer a comprehensive risk identification and mitigation po-
tential  for  security  (and  safety)  issues  relative  to  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain 
transportation program. In order to use these techniques it is first useful to identify 
where they may apply to the overall transportation effort. The following chart helps 
situate these four techniques relative to the four major components of the transpor-
tation infrastructure. 
Figure 2: Transportation analysis-in-depth: Risk reduction strategy 

The  examination  of  how  these  four  identification,  reduction  and  mitigation  tech-
niques  can  be  used  in  the  systematic  assessment  of  risk  for  the  Yucca  Mountain 
project,  the  analysis-in-depth  risk  reduction  concept  noted  above,  will  require  some 
details on what each technique will entail in real world practice. 

First, it is critical that they should be considered an integrated system of analysis, 
albeit one with some level of analytical hierarchy. The following chart demonstrates 
their interrelationship and the preferred hierarchy.

Security Surveys. Security surveys are the first level in this overall transportation 
risk  assessment  schema.  These  surveys  represent  a  physical  examination  of  the 
transportation security arrangements and typically use a check list approach to the 
examination  of  risks.  This  allows  for  the  standardization  and  management  of  the 
assessment  process.31 These  checklists  aid  security  efforts  and  provides  for  a  con-
sistent,  albeit  unimaginative  examination  of  risks.32 This  form  of  security  manage-
ment  is  typical  for  any  number  of  industrial  applications  and  has  a  long  tradition 
in  security.  At  a  minimum  this  survey  technique  needs  to  be  performed  at  various 
levels of the proposed Yucca Mountain transportation effort (for example at origina-
tion sites, for transportation efforts, at in-transit transfer facilities, and for destina-
tion conveyance infrastructures). 

The  problem  with  this  technique  is  that  it  is  typically  not  focused  on  the  adver-
saries and does not necessarily encourage thought relative to new countermeasures 
as  risks  change  over  time.  In  fact  surveys  become  reified  and  represent  a  binary 
(good/bad, black/white) approach to security and risk mitigation. They seem to imply 
that  risks  will  somehow  emerge  from  the  world  and  show  themselves  during  such 
surveys. Checklists are also fixed lists of observations to be conducted and typically 
closed  to  emerging  risks  that  have  heretofore  not  been  known  or  overlooked.  The 
list  becomes  what  human  assets  are  fixated  on,  not  focusing  security  personnel  on 
the  creative  protection  of  the  cargoes,  rather  making  them  focus  on  paperwork. 
These  surveys  are  often  misused,  especially  when  they  come  to  represent  ways  to 
manage people and ensure compliance to a security regime or regulations.33 

Security  surveys  have  a  place  in  the  overall  transportation  efforts  but  they  are 
not  in  and  of  themselves  a  cure  for  the  risks  that  transportation  efforts  to  Yucca 
Mountain will face. They represent a tool that should be employed by those involved 
in  the  transportation  effort  and  at  all  levels  of  the  transportation  infrastructure. 
They are the first line of defense since they are carried out traditionally by line staff 
and  management.  They  also  require  periodic  updates,  monitoring  and  analysis  as 
to their ability to meet current challenges and contemporary threats. They represent 
the  first  line  of  a  transportation  specific  defense-in-depth  concept  yet  to  be  adopted 
by DOE. 

Risk Management. The second step in the analysis-in-depth risk assessment proc-
ess  is  to  use  well  understood  and  common  place  risk  management  techniques.  The 
process  of  risk  management  is  fairly  straightforward.  In  the  first  phase  of  the  risk 
management  process  the  analyst  begins  with  identification  of  the  assets  in  need  of 
protection  and  ends  with  the  identification  of  safeguards  and  countermeasures.34 
Thus, the organization using the risk management technique should basically follow 
the flow of the following interrelated items: 
Figure 4: Risk Management Process

After  this  largely  abstract  intellectual  task  is  completed,  the  organization  then 
uses  an  expert  opinion  process  to  rank  order  priorities  and  probabilities  are  as-
signed  to  each  sub-phase  noted  above.  Typically  this  involves  predominantly  quan-
titative  outcomes  and  these  outcomes  are  summarized  in  tables,  charts,  and  the 
like.  Thereafter  the  transportation  management  team  would  appropriate,  and  field, 
security  resources  accordingly.  As  implied  by  the  chart,  the  process  begins  anew 
once  this  final  task  is  completed  and  in  practice  should  become  a  never  ending  se-
ries of assessments designed to improve the overall robustness of security. 

Risk  management  is  not  without  critics  in  the  nuclear  field  and  elsewhere.  Some 
argue  that  the  traditional  ways  of  conducting  risk  management  need  to  be  more 
quantitative or address more aspects than are traditionally used in such analysis,35 
while others note the political nature of the use of risk management.36 A systematic 
examination  of  risk  management  also  reveals  some  issues  of  concern.37 Once  again 
this  technique  is  typically  binary  and  closed  to  outside  input.  For  example,  there 
is  rarely  outside  input  on  contemporary  threats  and  vulnerabilities  since  risk  man-
agement  rests  on  known  (historic)  security  issues.  This  means  that  risk  manage-
ment is reactive, not proactive in mitigating risks. This also usually means that risk 
management is done without the creative spirit that the terrorists/adversaries bring 
to  the  table.  If  it  is  initiated,  managed  and  used  by  organization  staff  in  agencies 
(for  example  the  NRC  and  DOE)  and  represents  the  collective  consensus  of  these 
sometimes limited perspectives. 

Risk  assessment  is  rarely  the  creative  expression  of  alternatives.  Risk  manage-
ment  is  management  of  risks  by  managers  and  for  managers.  It  is  not  done  from 
alternative  perspectives  (for  example  the  adversaries).  The  assignment  of  prob-
abilities in risk management is often based on fantasy-like numbers that are created 
out  of  thin  air  to  placate  internal  constituencies  and/or  to  serve  political  purposes. 
Once these probabilities are codified in tables, charts and the like, they become real 
in their consequences as everyone involves start to believe they are real and act ac-
cordingly.38 The process itself and especially the documents that emerge create over-
confidence  in  the  numbers,  a  false  sense  of  security  that  is  problematic  in  the  face 
of real world creativity from adversaries. 

Risk management has its place in transportation planning for the potential Yucca 
Mountain  program  and  the  problems  noted  here  do  not  negate  its  usefulness.  As  a 
technique  it  is  not  a  be  all  and  end  all  in  risk  assessment.  The  use  of  quantitative 
data helps policymakers believe in a program, but that is a two edged sword. 

Design  Basis  Threat  (DBT).  The  third  level  of  the  analysis-in-depth  paradigm  is 
the  DBT.  In  some  respects  the  DBT  is  a  technique  not  that  unrelated  to  risk  man-
agement.39 A  DBT  is  a  proxy  threat,  a  hypothetical  scenario  based  on  descriptions 
of  the  threats  found  at  the  time  of  its  articulation.40 The  DBT  sets  the  standards 
for security personnel by defining the training, weapons and tactics that a terrorist/ 
adversary  group  could  use  to  attack  nuclear  facilities.  The  best  practices  of  DBT 
usage call on its proponents to design security to face the contemporary threats, rec-
ognizing  vulnerabilities  and  to  allocate  resources  accordingly.41 DBTs  tend  to  focus 
on infrastructure and physical security hardware, more so than risk management.42 
The  published  DBT  details  for  nuclear  power  plants  serve  as  an  illustration  of 
this process and its outcomes. The DBT has been used since the 1970s in the United 
States and is not a single process. It has also been used in various ways by different 
countries as the IAEA seeks to standardize the process around the globe. First and 
foremost  it  is  the  basis  of  physical  protection  systems  (PPS)  for  fixed  sites.  It  also 
serves  as  the  means  by  which  an  evaluation  of  that  PPS  is  conducted.  Since  2000 
the IAEA has promoted the DBT and provides (in conjunction with Sandia National 
Labs) nine steps for the process of development, use and maintenance of a DBT sys-
tem. Besides the basic facts noted in this paragraph certain scholars 43 suggest that 
a DBT generally includes: 

nization. 

• Identification of the roles and responsibilities within and connected to the orga-
• Development of operating assumptions for the usage of the DBT. 
• Identify a range of potential generic adversary threats. 
• Identify a list of threat characteristics. 
• Identify sources of threat information. 
• Analyze  and  organize  threat-related  information.  (Steps  one  to  six  create  a 
• Develop threat assessment and gain consensus about said. 
• Create a national level DBT. 
• Introduce the DBT into the regulatory framework.

67 

The DBT process, and specifically its first six steps, should yield both motivations 
for  attacks,  intentions  of  the  attackers  and  characteristics  of  the  attacking  force. 
These are then matrixed across a range of adversaries (protesters, activists, extrem-
ists,  criminals  and  terrorists).  In  most  cases  these  are  created  from  assumptions 
based on historic data and firmly rooted in a philosophy that insists that all threats 
must  be  ‘‘credible.’’  This  philosophy  is  counter  intuitive  to  9/11  threat  realities  and 
may blind the creators to new/emerging threats or threats that are evolving as past 
threats  change  to  meet  new  circumstances.  Typically  the  DBT  philosophy  does  pro-
mote the continuation of the status quo. 

The NRC and DOE have updated their DBT in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, 
once  in  2003  and  again  in  2004,  both  times  in  a  process  outside  the  normative 
framework  for  such  adjustments.  Specific  details  are  not  known  for  these  classified 
documents but the expectation is that they will take years to implement a new DBT 
and  that  the  final  product  was  diluted  as  a  result  of  industry  concern  over  costs. 
Likewise,  the  DBT  has  been  criticized  since  it  does  not  meet  the  threat  threshold 
the 9/11 attacks presented.44 

DBTs have their critics and the criticisms run along similar lines to those for the 
risk management techniques.45 The DBT is a typically binary process and closed to 
outside  input,  primarily  for  security  reasons  like  classification  of  results.  Because 
of the closing of discussion for security reasons, there is rarely outside input on con-
temporary  threats  and  vulnerabilities.  Second,  like  risk  management  the  DBT  be-
comes a reactive device. As a proxy attack strategy it is not proactive in mitigating 
risks.  Similar  to  risk  management  the  DBT  process  is  dominated  by  the  organiza-
tion  staff.  The  DBT  represents  the  collective  consensus  of  these  limited  and  some-
times  self-serving  perspectives.  It  does  not  represent  a  creative  expression  of  alter-
natives  and  rarely  addresses  emerging  threats.  Once  the  DBT  is  determined  it  be-
comes  real  in  its  consequences  for  the  agencies  using  this  technique.  The  threat  is 
what  the  DBT  says  it  is,  nothing  more  or  nothing  less.  The  DBT  provides  insider 
organizations,  although  not  the  public  and  other  stakeholders,  with  a  sense  of  con-
fidence  that  may  be  disproportional  to  the  risks  and  reality  of  a  changing  world.  It 
allows  an  existing  organization  like  the  DOE  to  define  what  the  threats  are,  and 
once  the  DBT  is  constructed,  to  maintain  a  faith  in  their  assessments,  a  self  ful-
filling belief system that can be dangerous when one is protecting something as po-
tentially dangerous as highly radioactive wastes. 

In some cases critics have argued for a layered approach to DBT implementation, 
a  strategy  that  recognizes  financial  resource  differentials  in  government’s  respon-
sible for implementation.46 This criticism is primarily focused on less developed na-
tions  where  the  resources  necessary  to  protect  nuclear  assets  are  not  readily  avail-
able. In the case of advanced industrial nations the AHARA—as high as reasonably 
achievable—principle behind such debate suggests that these nations should achieve 
the  IAEA’s  goals  of  securing  radioactive  materials  against  human-initiated  events. 
These  less  than  reasonable  security  debates  do  not  apply  to  the  United  States,  a 
country rich in resources. 

Additionally,  as  noted  DBTs  are  supportive  of  the  status  quo.  They  seem  to  say 
to  everyone  involved  we  are  doing  good,  look  how  hard  we  worked  to  define  the 
threats  and  our  perceptions  of  the  vulnerabilities  we  face  are  excellent.  It  ignores 
alternative  threats  since  they  are  deemed  too  improbable  or  they  are  not  perceived 
at all—they are deemed a very subjective ‘‘uncreditable.’’ The DBT seems to commu-
nicate  to  one  and  all  that  whatever  terrorists/adversaries  can  do  poses  a  lesser 
threat  than  our  proxy  measure  (DBT),  a  dangerous  oversimplification  in  the  post- 
9/11 world of nuclear security. 

DBTs  also  take  time  to  change,  they  are  not  assessed  systematically  but  rather 
on an as needed basis. The DOE mandated and NRC inspired changes in implemen-
tation  for  weapons  production  facilities  and  commercial  nuclear  power  plants  after 
the 9/11 terrorist attacks illustrate this delay—changes in the DBT were revised in 
2003, changed again in 2004 and are still undergoing implementation as of the sev-
enth  anniversary  of  those  attacks  with  an  expected  date  for  completion  being  in 
2008.47 Supporters  argue  that  a  change  in  the  DBT  is  costly  but  critics  point  out 
so too would be a successful attack. 

The DBT is a step forward from past risk assessment practice and one that allows 
transportation  managers  to  create  a  proxy  for  security  to  train  against.  It  is  dif-
ferent  than  security  surveys  and  risk  management,  but  it  is  not  the  single  magic 
bullet to security. Rather the DBT is one tool in the overall toolbox for risk mitiga-
tion.  The  fourth  technique,  adversarial  vulnerability  assessment,  helps  with  some 
of the limitations noted for DBTs. 

Adversarial  Vulnerability  Assessments  (AVA).  One  critical  omission  of  all  three  of 
the techniques detailed above is bringing the motives, mindset and creativity of the 
adversary into the risk equation. Those who would wish to perpetrate a human-ini-

tiated  event  are  far  more  resourceful  than  the  security  surveys,  risk  management 
and DBT techniques seemingly give them credit for. To accomplish the task of recog-
nizing  such  creativity  Johnson  (2005) 48 advises  that  it  is  necessary  to  conduct  a 
‘‘mental  coordinate  transformation.’’  This  means  that  when  assessing  risks  for  crit-
ical  SNF  and  HLW  transportation  infrastructure  it  is  necessary  to  think  like  the 
perpetrators,  not  like  security  professionals,  not  like  energy  company  officials,  and 
not like oversight agency management. 

The major barrier faced by security professionals and risk managers in doing this 
task  is  that  they  are  rarely  prepared  for  this  mental  transformation.  As  a  result  of 
organizational  socialization  they  cannot,  or  will  not,  use  the  opportunity  to  actively 
look for threats, to engage in the alternative and/or to think like the terrorist, sabo-
teur or other perpetrator of human initiated events. They have difficulty letting the 
opponent define reality, a reality that is securely planted in their professional lives 
by the very industry they seek to protect—one that for many reasons does not admit 
gleefully to risks, threats or terrorism as a potentiality. Altering Johnson’s (2005) 49 
approach  for  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  project  would  entail  the 
necessary  mental  transformation  for  the  NEPA  assessment.  This  is  best  accom-
plished by the following steps: 

• Understand the full scope of the transportation effort. This includes all aspects, 
parts,  components  and  variables  in  the  transportation  system.  This  is  difficult 
since  the  totality  of  the  system  is  enormous  and  in  many  cases  individuals  are 
asked  to  transform  their  thinking  while  working  on  small  parts  of  the  overall 
picture. Still it is necessary since the parts are integrated and the risk synergy 
for  the  total  system  far  outweighs  the  singular  transportation  component  risk 
level. 
• Brainstorm  in  a  creative,  innovative,  and  multi-level  manner  that  allows  you 
to not just identify a threat, but to focus attention to a range of threats.50 Once 
the  totality  of  the  program  is  recognized,  members  of  a  risk  focus  group  are 
gathered to work on the issues, share their insight into the risks, and to brain-
storm on threats facing this transportation system. These discussions would re-
veal  attack  exemplar  scenarios  tied  to  risks,  not  singular  as  is  the  case  of  a 
DBT, but multiple threats and with multiple consequence profiles. 
• Once  attack  sceneries  are  identified,  the  group  starts  to  edit  these  down  to  es-
sential elements and exemplars that demonstrate vulnerabilities of the system, 
not  just  a  single  part  of  this  complex  transportation  effort.  This  group  would 
prioritize  potential  attacks  which  represent  a  range  of  possibilities,  con-
sequences  and  potential  responses.  These  alternatives  must  be  developed,  ar-
ticulated and vetted with a wide range of constitutes/stakeholders to gain addi-
tional  insight  and  to  reduce  the  problems  of  group  think  and  collective  risk 
blindness that sometimes arise in small groups. 
• The last step is to determine the feasibility of these attacks by means of a range 
of  attack  articulations,  analyze  radiological  consequences  of  these  alternatives 
and devise countermeasures to mitigate these risks. 

Several provisos are offered to those considering adopting AVA methods. First and 
foremost,  let  those  involved  be  creative.51 In  the  case  of  terrorism  threats,  the 
changes  in  technology,  availability  of  information  and  tactical  knowledge  of  adver-
saries  demand  that  those  involved  be  allowed  freedom  to  achieve  this  creative  ap-
proach  to  risk  assessment.  Historical  data,  and  historically  situated  risk  percep-
tions,  are  less  significant  in  the  face  of  global  social  challenges  like  currently  are 
transpiring,  a  point  often  missed  by  those  who  work  in  formal  organizations.  AVA 
risk  measurement  is  predicated  on  creativity  which  must  be  combined  with  organi-
zational  experience,  technological  skills  and  bureaucratic  imagination.  All  of  these 
tasks  are  difficult  for  many  formal  organizations  to  engage  in  but  the  challenges 
they pose are important to overcome. 

Johnson  (2005) 52 advises  that  creativity  is  the  domain  of  individuals,  not  formal 
organizations. Good group dynamics can enhance this individual creative spirit and 
groups need to be involved to prioritize and determine feasibility. One of many tech-
niques  to  help  this  creative  process  is  to  reverse  engineer  the  attacks  in  an  effort 
to solve problems that have yet to arise. This is a particularly cogent piece of advice 
given the elongated timeline for the proposed Yucca Mountain project and points out 
the need for a systematic longitudinal analysis paradigm so that data can be gather 
to inform the processes. 

One of the most interesting advisements offered is that the system conducting this 
analysis  must  bring  in  outsiders  and  not  use  the  typical  cast  of  insider  characters 
who have vested interests in the status quo. The use of the same old energy indus-
try  insiders  and  the  same  supporting  industrial  infrastructure  insiders  ensures  the

69 

same  old  results.  It  does  not  offer  a  creative  analysis  of  threats.  Furthermore  it  is 
necessary  to  combine  these  outsiders  with  creative  insiders  in  the  brainstorming 
groups  and  set  ground  rules  for  all  the  contributors.  These  ground  rules  have  to 
allow for all manner of input and treats each contribution as significant, be it from 
inside  or  outside  the  typical  organizational  patterns  of  thought.  Johnson  (2005) 53 
offers  some  AVA  imperatives  as  guidance.  These  have  been  modified  to  the  Yucca 
Mountain project and include: 

• Minimize  the  conflicts  of  interest  and  reduce  wishful  thinking  on  the  parts  of 

group members. 

• To promote creativity in the group processes, the system must not punish those 

who creatively deconstruct its assumptions, bias, and working relationships. 

• The  overall  group  and  its  work  product  need  to  be  assessed  by  a  second  group 
of  outsiders,  called  assessors.  These  assessors  should  be  independent  from  the 
Yucca Mountain project, experienced in finding problems and offering solutions, 
and in no small measure represent the public stakeholders for the project. 

• All  parties  involved  must  discard  the  binary  way  of  viewing  risks.  This  means 
individuals  need  to  be  able  to  work  within  the  gray  areas  of  life,  not  the  rigid 
confines  of  an  engineering  perspective  or  other  professional  paradigm  that  pro-
motes the status quo philosophy. 

• The  group  members  are  tasked  with  finding  vulnerabilities  and  risks,  which  is 
their  primary  purpose.  As  such  they  should  not  be  encouraged  to  find  no 
vulnerabilities  or  no  risks,  a  philosophy  that  is  counter-productive  to  the  AVA 
process. 

• AVAs  are  not  a  pass  or  fail  technique  for  the  group  as  a  whole  and  the  group 
participants must be encouraged to reject this form of thinking. The point is to 
find  vulnerabilities  and  risks,  not  fix  them  per  se.  Thus,  finding  these 
vulnerabilities and risks is a good outcome, not a negative outcome of the group 
process. 

• The process must be done before transportation planning is fixed in policy, done 
again  when  plans  are  finalized  but  before  transport  begins,  and  done  periodi-
cally thereafter (for example bi-annually or annually). 

• AVAs are a holistic approach to vulnerability identification and risk mitigation. 

They should not be done in isolation (for example for the rail system alone). 

• The  conveners,  participants  and/or  the  assessors  should  not  be  restricted  as  to 
time,  budget  or  attack  possibilities.  They  should  be  allowed  to  creatively  face 
the  social  context  of  global  conditions  relative  to  terrorism,  sabotage  and  other 
human initiated events. 

• The  group  should  be  encouraged  to  never  underestimate  the  resourcefulness, 
creativity or commitment of the adversary. They should remember it is the ad-
versary that defines the threat, not the protectors. 

• The  group  should  establish  a  hierarchy  of  threats,  simplest  to  most  complex, 
least severe radiological consequences to most severe radiological consequences. 
They  need  also  look  at  contingencies  that  would  take  a  second  tier  threat  and 
make  it  a  major  radiological  event.  This  is  one  area  where  DBTs  seem  to  fail, 
they  are  based  on  one  threat  and  do  not  necessarily  account  for  such  upgrades 
and modifications. 

• Everyone should assume that adversaries know what security arrangements are 
in  place,  have  the  creativity  to  overcome  these  and/or  will  exploit  those  in-
stances  where  the  system  does  not  meet  its  presumed  minimum  operation  lev-
els. Systems fail and human security systems fail to protect even the most crit-
ical of assets over time. 

• A  range  of  attacks  should  be  considered  by  this  group:  terrorism,  sabotage, 
probes  of  the  security  system,  insider/outsider/insided-outsided  threats,  social 
engineering, and the many other varieties of human initiated events that could 
transpire. 

• The longer a system is in place, the higher its vulnerability and risk to attack. 
Vigilance  decreases  with  familiarity,  hence  the  systematic  reevaluation  of  risks 
becomes  increasingly  important  over  the  lifespan  of  the  program.  It  is  equally 
important to note that once an AVA is complete, perhaps even deemed excellent 
by  all  involved,  it  is  not  the  end  product  and  cannot  stand  alone  in  the  face  of 
the  ever-changing  security  threats  faced.  Once  the  AVA  is  complete  it  is  then 
systematically  and  periodically  subject  to  challenges  from  the  original  group, 
from new group participants and from new human initiated events/tactics.

• The  group  should  avoid  common  nuclear  industry  fallacies.  For  example,  many 
believe  that  all  vulnerability  will  be  discovered  and  thus  all  risk  mitigated. 
Likewise  they  should  be  cautioned  to  avoid  mindsets  that  see  compliance  as 
good security, layers of mediocre security equals good security, and/or that high- 
tech security is the answer for all vulnerabilities and risks. 

AVAs  are  not  the  final  and  best  answer  to  the  reduction  of  risk,  just  as  security 
surveys, risk management and DBTs do not tell the whole risk story. They are also 
not unknown to the nuclear industry. For example, they have already been used in 
the  nuclear  waste  field  for  low  level  waste  and  relative  to  interim  storage.54 They 
also were advocated as one means to increase security after the terrorist attacks of 
September  11,  2001,  and  for  use  in  critical  infrastructure  sectors  like  the  chemical 
industry.55 These  techniques  have  even  been  around  a  sufficient  length  of  time  to 
note development in their applications.56 Regarding their use in environmental pol-
icy  debates,  as  has  been  the  case  with  Yucca  Mountain,  Busenberg  (1999) 57 notes 
they are effective in reducing policy disputes, a quality lacking in many suggestions 
for  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  project.  Last,  these  have  been  used  in  the  energy 
industry for security considerations relative to oil and gas pipelines, a similar secu-
rity  dilemma  to  that  posed  by  transporting  nuclear  waste  across  country  to  Ne-
vada.58 

The  AVA  is  one  tool  in  the  overall  risk  assessment  tool  set  necessary  to  secure 
the transportation of highly radioactive materials like SNF and HLW. Used in con-
junction  with  the  other  three  techniques  it  allows  a  different  perspective  on  the 
problems the system may face, a valuable perspective not offered at any other time 
in the lifecycle of the transportation program. 
Step Three—Scenario Exemplars 

Analysis-in-depth  is  a  management  paradigm  and  an  analytical  imperative  nec-
essary to accomplish the formable task of vulnerability and risk assessment for the 
complex, decades-long transportation effort that would be necessary for the proposed 
Yucca  Mountain  repository.  The  following  sections  provide  a  risk  matrix  and  cor-
responding threat scenarios that could emerge from an AVA process, if applied. The 
details  and  threats  noted  therein  are  gleamed  from  the  literature  and  used  to  rep-
resent  best  practices  in  risk  assessment  for  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  project. 
They  do  not  directly  correspond  to  the  issues  noted  above;  rather  they  examine  a 
subset of the overall risk of human-initiated events for transporting nuclear wastes. 
The following matrix shows some of the potential human-initiated events identified 
for further study.

The Risk Matrix 

Considering  the  Yucca  Mountain  transportation  options  identified  by  DOE,  five 
modes of transportation could potentially be used for repository shipments over the 
projected 50-year operations period. These include: 

• Rail Casks Shipped by Rail. 
• Rail Casks Shipped by Barge. 
• Rail Casks Shipped by Heavy Haul Truck. 
• Truck Casks Shipped by Rail. 
• Truck Casks Shipped by Legal Limit Truck. 
These  five  transportation  modes,  traveling  to  Yucca  Mountain  from  76  shipping 
sites in more than 30 states, with an average shipment distance greater than 2,000 
miles,  will  be  subject  to  many  possible  attack  strategies  over  five  decades.  This  ap-
proach uses a range of exemplar human-initiated event strategies as an illustration 
of the risks associated with the transportation of these materials. These include: 

• Theft of the Cargo. 
• Transportation Infrastructure Attacks. 
• Anti-tank and/or Stand-off Weapons Attacks. 
• Capture of Shipment and use of High-Energy Density (HED) Weapons. 
These exemplars suggest that a range of consequences must be factored into risk 
assessment since they present a range of potential attack outcomes. These outcomes 
include: 

• Attacks to Disrupt Shipments (Minimum Radioactive Dispersal). 
• Attacks to Disperse the Cask Contents (Moderate Radioactive Release). 
• Attacks for Maximum Consequences (Catastrophic Radioactive Release). 
The following chart allows for the analysis of these various factors simultaneously 
and has estimates of the consequences listed in italics as they relate to the scenario 
analysis that follows.

Taken  together  these  modes,  human  initiated  event  strategies,  and  hypothesized 
consequence outcomes can be conglomerated into a risk matrix for simplified use by 
risk managers, security personnel and for the specific purposes of risk identification, 
analysis and mitigation. A radioactive dispersal, whether it is considered minimum, 
moderate  or  catastrophic  for  the  purposes  of  analysis,  depends  on  many  variables, 
including  the  age  of  the  fuel,  the  burn-up  history  of  that  fuel,  the  crud  inventory 
in the transport cask, the degradation of the cladding, the number of assemblies in 
a given cask, and so forth. However, a properly constructed assessment process can 
address  these  variables,  and  recommend  appropriate  countermeasures  and  mitiga-
tion strategies. 
Conclusion 

First  and  foremost,  the  materials  in  question,  huge  quantities  of  highly  radio-
active  wastes  from  nuclear  power  plants  and  weapons  production  facilities,  do  not 
have to be transported across America to Yucca Mountain. The energy industry has 
assured the public that power plants are safe and secure, thus sheltering the wastes 
in  place  at  these  facilities  seems  the  prudent  thing  to  do.  At  these  secure  facilities 
they  would  not  be  subject  to  protests,  labor  unrest,  sabotage  or  terrorism  during 
transit activities, in short they are safer where they sit. 

Likewise,  if  the  program  does  move  forward,  alternatives  to  DOE  management 
exist. As the NAS has suggested, DOE could be replaced as the agency of responsi-
bility  for  the  proposed  Yucca  Mountain  project.  This  action  would  help  the  cred-
itability of the proposal since many stakeholders and members of the general public 
have historic reasons to distrust this agency and its claims regarding safety and se-
curity. This is another option for you to consider in your oversight role. 

If  the  program  does  proceed  and  DOE  is  left  in  charge,  the  testimony  examined 
the  current  state  of  risk  assessment  for  human-initiated  events  against  SNF  and 
HLW shipments to the proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In the proc-
ess  this  analysis  identified  a  variety  of  potential  human  initiated  event  scenarios 
for  consideration  by  this  agency  and  its  transportation  planners.  These  represent  a 
range of creditable threats, consequences and for a variety of transportation compo-
nents that would be used during a transportation campaign. 

The  necessity  of  this  reconsideration  is  based  on  the  fact  that  attack  scenarios 
evaluated  in  the  Draft  Supplemental  EIS  for  Yucca  Mountain,  and  the  Draft  Ne-
vada Rail Alignment EIS, repeat the methods used by DOE and NRC over the past 
three  decades.  They  are  not  proactive  in  response  to  9/11  and  do  not  reflect  state- 
of-the-art  risk  assessment  techniques.  The  DOE/NRC  analyses  assumed  single- 
phase  attack  scenarios  and  other  limiting  assumptions  that  may  artificially  con-
strain  the  results.  None  of  these  consequence  assessments  have  evaluated  impact- 
exacerbating tactics, such as combined use of a breaching device and a dispersal de-
vice,  or  use  of  multiple  breaching  devices.  None  of  these  consequence  assessments 
have evaluated the impact-exacerbating tactics studied by counter-terrorism experts 
in the post-9/11 environment. 

The  methodology  presented  herein  advocates  use  of  an  analysis-in-depth  method 
that  uses  current  risk  assessment  methods,  but  adds  the  well  known  AVA  as  an 
extra  layer  of  protection  to  offset  the  change  in  the  risk  environment  due  to  ter-
rorism. The purpose of the AVA technique is to harness the creatively and ingenuity 
of people outside the formal bureaucratic organization that is the DOE and in doing

so  improve  the  risk  analysis.  Such  an  approach  would  respond  to  the  WGA  resolu-
tion on transportation terrorism risks. 
Ways to Review DOE Efforts 

In the post-9/11 world almost all Federal agencies with a significant homeland se-
curity  role  have  had  to  rethink  their  assumptions  on  how  best  to  serve  the  public 
interest. One conclusion suggested from the alternative scholarship on Yucca Moun-
tain transportation risks is that the DOE does not get it—they are stuck in an engi-
neering  based  bureaucratic  paradigm,  or  if  you  will,  an  organizationally  dysfunc-
tional way of thinking. This DOE mindset prevents this agency from looking outside 
of their narrowly defined transportation risk assessment agendas. 

In  the  case  of  Yucca  Mountain,  the  unwritten  ‘‘demand’’  for  programmatic  pro-
gression  after  years  of  DOE  mismanagement  seemingly  overrides  a  systematic  and 
serious reconsideration of risks for the transportation of these radioactive materials. 
This  committee  should  consider  how  to  compel  reform  of  the  DOE’s  work  on  Yucca 
Mountain  in  light  of  the  new  threat  environment.  To  date  a  systematic  recognition 
of  this  new  threat  environment  is  not  evidenced  by  this  agencies  continued  refusal 
to acknowledge real and pressing issues with their planning for shipments to Yucca 
Mountain. 

The DOE is continually revising their transportation concept for Yucca Mountain 
and could readily alter their current program to adopt the recommended risk reduc-
tion  process.  Considering  the  currently  delayed  schedule  for  the  repository  and  the 
proposed rail line, it seems unlikely that shipments to Yucca Mountain could begin 
earlier  than  2020.  There  is  ample  time  for  another  agency  or  if  left  in  charge,  for 
the  DOE,  to  systematically  address  human-initiated  events.  Revision  of  such  docu-
ments  as  the  various  Supplemental  EIS’s,  Transportation  Concept  of  Operations, 
National  Transportation  Plan,  national  routing  studies,  and  in  its  implementation 
of  Section  180c  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  affected  states  and  Indian 
tribes would at a minimum be desirable. 

If  this  testimony  could  leave  this  committee  with  only  three  points  to  consider, 

they would be: 

Point One: 
• Yucca  Mountain  transportation  is  risky  and  will  present  a  target  rich  environ-
ment  for  adversaries.  The  shipments  are  symbolically  important  and  represent 
a radiological significant target. 

• The  solution  is  to  shelter  the  shipments  in  place  at  the  sites  of  waste  origin. 
As noted by the NRC, energy industry and others, they are safe and secure fac-
ulties. Why expose wastes to risks during transportation if not necessary? 

Point Two: 
• DOE  has  systematically  neglected  to  address  the  laundry  lists  of  concerns 
brought forth by stakeholders. These deliberate choices by the DOE increase the 
likelihood of attacks, the consequences of those attacks and the resultant social 
dislocations if these attacks succeed. 

• The  solution  is  to  compel  the  DOE  its  mandate  to  engage  in  a  meaningful  na-
tional level NEPA process for transport. That process should directly addresses 
stakeholder  concerns  that  have  been  documented  over  the  decades  of  Yucca 
Mountain debates. 

Point Three: 
• DOE,  in  consultation  with  stakeholders,  should  engage  in  systematic  risk  as-
sessment  method  of  analysis.  In  particular,  it  should  use  the  AVA  process  in 
conjunction with other methods to provide a more robust triangulated analysis. 
• The  solution  here  is  to  do  it  and  will  allow  the  DOE  to  avoid  the  potentially 
fatal  fault  of  being  reactive  to  threats  and  become  more  proactive  in  relation-
ship to human initiated events. 

I wish to thank the Committee for allowing me to offer an alternative perspective 
on this important issue. If you have any questions I will be happy to answer them.

STATEMENT OF EDWARD R. HAMBERGER, PRESIDENT AND 

CEO, ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN RAILROADS 

Mr.  HAMBERGER.  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Thune,  the  Association 
of  American  Railroads  appreciates  the  opportunity  present  our 
views on the transportation of spent nuclear fuels. 

Before  I  address  that  topic,  however,  on  behalf  of  the  members 
of the AAR, I want to express deep condolences to the victims, the 
families,  and  friends  of  those  who  were  hurt  and  injured  in  too 
many  cases,  fatally  injured  in  the  commuter  rail  accident  in 
Chatsworth, California last Friday. 

We have been working very closely with this Committee, the cor-
responding Committee in the House, to help craft legislation to ad-
dress certain areas of rail safety. We are very pleased that that has 
reached  its  final  step,  and  I  believe  even  as  we  meet  here  today, 
it  may  be  being  considered  on  the  House  floor.  And  I  hope  that  it 
will pass the Senate before the end of the week because we believe 
that it will result in meaningful rail safety improvement. 

The  freight  industry,  rail  industry  does  have  an  excellent  safety 
record,  in  general,  in  moving  hazardous  materials,  including  spent 
nuclear fuel in particular. Since my written testimony and my sev-
eral  appearances  before  this  committee  over  the  past  year  go  into 
great  detail  on  our  safety  record,  I  will  only  note  here  today  that 
2007  was  the  safest  year  on  record  in  terms  of  accident  rate  per 
million train miles. 

We  recognize  that  special  measures  are  needed  to  ensure  that 
the spent fuel is moved without incident. The railroads believe that 
the  safest  possible  method  of  transporting  spent  nuclear  fuel  is  in 
dedicated  trains.  We  are  pleased  to  note  that  the  Department  of 
Energy now shares that belief and wish that the Department of the 
Navy would soon join us both in that belief. 

We  believe  that  dedicated  trains  offer  important  safety  advan-

One,  they  do  not  require  switching  in  rail  yards  as  do  trains  in 
general freight service, thus reducing time in transit and potential 
for mishandling accidents. 

Two,  dedicated  trains  allow  the  train  to  be  equipped  with  elec-

tronically controlled pneumatic brakes and premium suspensions.

Three, spent nuclear fuel cars are extremely heavy, heavier than 
any  other  car  in  service,  thus  increasing  the  potential  for  an  acci-
dent because of the different handling characteristics. 

And  finally,  spent  nuclear  fuel  dedicated  trains  can  be  moved 
with greater security. Escorts as required by DOT and the Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  would  have  certainly  a  less  difficult  time 
monitoring  spent  nuclear  fuel  on  dedicated  trains  than  in  general 
freight service. 

We  are  confident  that  we  can  transport  spent  nuclear  fuel  ex-
tremely safely. However, despite all the precautions taken, there is 
clearly some risk in the transport of spent nuclear fuel. No firm in 
any  industry  and  certainly  not  a  rail  industry  that  has  an  outdoor 
factory  floor  of  some  140,000  miles  in  length  can  guarantee  with 
complete  certainty  that  no  accident  or  terrorist  attack  will  occur. 
Recognizing  this,  Congress  enacted  the  Price-Anderson  Act  which 
provides  limited  protection  for  companies  from  an  incident  involv-
ing the release of nuclear material, including its transport. 

More  than  25  years  ago,  the  Interstate  Commerce  Commission 
ruled  that  railroads  have  a  common  carrier  obligation  to  transport 
shipments of spent nuclear fuel. Partially that ruling came because 
of the liability protections offered under Price-Anderson. 

Freight railroads, alone of all modes, also have a common carrier 
obligation  to  transport  toxic  by  inhalation  hazardous  and  other 
highly hazardous materials. Chairman Inouye referred to that ear-
lier. Chlorine is certainly one of those and anhydrous ammonia the 
other. Those two represent about 80,000 car loads a year of 100,000 
car  loads  of  TIH  materials.  However,  we  do  not  have  any  com-
parable  Price-Anderson  protections  for  this  transportation,  nor  can 
railroads fully insure against the multi-billion risks associated with 
these shipments. This places the railroads in an untenable position. 
I  submit  that  if  there  is  a  public  interest  need  for  railroads  to 
be  compelled  to  carry  TIH  chemicals,  just  as  the  ICC  determined 
there  is  for  spent  nuclear  fuel,  there  is  a  corresponding  public  in-
terest  for  limiting  the  railroad’s  potentially  ruinous  liability  as  in 
the  case  with  Price-Anderson.  This  could  be  achieved  if  policy-
makers enacted a Price-Anderson type solution for TIH shipments, 
and we would be pleased to discuss this with members of the Com-
mittee. 

We  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify,  and  I,  of  course, 

would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Hamberger follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD R. HAMBERGER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN RAILROADS 

The  Association  of  American  Railroads  (AAR)  appreciates  this  opportunity  to  ad-
dress the transportation of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). AAR members account for the 
vast  majority  of  freight  railroad  mileage,  employees,  and  traffic  in  Canada,  Mexico, 
and the United States. 

Should meaningful amounts of spent nuclear fuel require transportation, it is like-
ly  that  AAR  members  would  be  called  upon  to  handle  most  of  those  movements 
(whether it would be to the Yucca Mountain repository 1 or elsewhere), since the De-
partment  of  Energy  (DOE)  has  indicated  that  it  prefers  rail  transportation  for  the

tory.

movement of SNF.2 Why? Safety, predominantly. There has never been a release of 
radioactive materials in connection with the transportation of SNF by rail. 
Overview of Freight Rail Safety 

First  of  all,  on  behalf  of  the  members  of  the  AAR,  I  offer  my  deep  condolences 
to  the  victims  of  the  recent  tragic  commuter  rail  accident  in  California  and  their 
families.  As  many  of  you  know,  freight  railroads  have  been  working  very  closely 
with this Committee and others in Congress to draft and pass comprehensive legis-
lation that will address critical areas of rail safety. We are confident that the legis-
lation will result in meaningful rail safety improvement. 

For  freight  railroads,  pursuing  safe  operations  is  not  an  option,  it  is  an  impera-
tive. It makes business sense and it’s the right thing to do. Through massive invest-
ments in safety-enhancing infrastructure, equipment, and technology; extensive em-
ployee  training;  cooperation  with  rail  labor,  suppliers,  customers,  communities,  and 
the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); cutting-edge research and development; 
and  steadfast  commitment  to  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  freight  railroads  are 
at the forefront of advancing safety. 

Freight  railroads  have  an  excellent  and  improving  safety  record,  reflecting  the 
extraor-dinary  importance  railroads  place  on  the  safety  of  their  employees,  their 
customers,  and  the  communities  they  serve.  As  an  official  from  the  FRA  noted  in 
testimony to Congress in February 2007, ‘‘The railroads have an outstanding record 
in moving all goods safely.’’ 

In  fact,  2007  was  the  safest  year  ever  for  railroads,  according  to  FRA  data,  and 
preliminary  partial  year  data  for  2008  show  continued  improvement.  In  2007,  the 
train  accident  rate  was  the  lowest  ever,  down  71  percent  since  1980.  The  grade 
crossing collision rate was the lowest ever, down 77 percent since 1980. And the em-
ployee injury rate was the second lowest ever, down 80 percent since 1980. 

Moreover, according to U.S. Department of Labor data, railroads today have lower 
employee  injury  rates  than  other  modes  of  transportation  and  most  other  major  in-
dustry  groups,  including  agriculture,  construction,  manufacturing,  and  private  in-
dustry  as  a  whole—even  grocery  stores.  Available  data  also  indicate  that  U.S.  rail-
roads  have  employee  injury  rates  well  below  those  of  most  major  foreign  railroads.

Railroads are proud of their safety record, which results from their recognition of 
their responsibilities regarding safety and the enormous resources they devote to its 
advancement.  At  the  same  time,  railroads  want  rail  safety  to  continue  to  improve. 
Railroads are always willing to work cooperatively with Members of this Committee, 
other  policymakers,  the  FRA,  rail  employees,  and  others  to  find  practical,  effective 
ways to make this happen. 
Railroads Have an Excellent Hazmat Safety Record 

Today, U.S. railroads transport very little spent nuclear fuel. In 2007, there were 
just  14  originations;  in  the  5-years  from  2003  to  2007,  there  were  only  314.  Rail-
roads  do,  however,  haul  significant  amounts  of  other  hazardous  materials.  In  fact, 
each year, 1.7 to 1.8 million carloads of hazardous materials are transported by rail 
in the United States. Materials that present a ‘‘toxic inhalation hazard’’ (TIH)—i.e., 
gases or liquids (such as chlorine and anhydrous ammonia) that are especially haz-
ardous if released—are a subset of hazardous materials. Railroads transport around 
100,000  carloads  of  TIH  each  year.  For  perspective,  DOE  projects  that  there  would 
be, at most, around 400 carloads of spent nuclear fuel transported annually. 

In 2006 (the most recent year for which data are available), 99.996 percent of rail 
hazmat shipments reached their destination without a release caused by a train ac-
cident.  That  equates  to  one  accident  with  a  hazmat  release  for  every  56,000  rail 
hazmat carloads. 

The  overall  rail  hazmat  accident  rate  is  down  88  percent  since  1980  and  down 
39  percent  since  1990.  And  although  no  firm  in  any  industry  can  guarantee  that 
it  will  never  suffer  an  accident,  the  railroads’  overall  safety  record  should  give  you 
and the public confidence in the rail transport of SNF if the public interest requires 
its transportation. 
How Can the Safety of SNF Transport be Maximized? 

Notwithstanding  freight  railroads’  excellent  safety  record,  they  recognize  that 
public  concern  over  radioactive  materials  requires  that  all  parties  involved  in  the 
transport of SNF take special measures to ensure safe movement. In particular, the 
DOE  and  Department  of  Defense  (as  the  shippers  of  SNF),  the  Department  of 
Transportation  (the  regulator  of  the  safety  aspects  of  hazmat  transport),  and  the 
railroads must work together to design the safest possible transportation system for 
SNF. 

For  many  years,  the  rail  industry  has  urged  the  use  of  dedicated  trains—i.e., 
trains  with  no  other  freight  than  SNF,  traveling  from  one  origin  to  one  destina-
tion—to transport SNF. In 2005, the DOE issued a statement that it was DOE pol-

icy to use dedicated trains as the usual mode for its shipments to Yucca Mountain.3 
The  DOE  identified  important  safety,  security,  and  system  cost  benefits  to  the  use 
of  dedicated  trains  at  that  time.  More  recently,  the  DOE  stated,  in  its  application 
to  the  Surface  Transportation  Board  (STB)  to  construct  a  railroad  line  that  would 
serve the Yucca Mountain repository, that it intends to use dedicated trains on that 
line. 

Dedicated  trains  in  fact  offer  numerous  key  safety  advantages  that  would  reduce 

the already very small possibility of an accident involving SNF transport. 

First,  SNF  cars  in  dedicated  trains  would  not  have  to  be  ‘‘switched’’  in  and  out 
of  trains  at  rail  yards,  many  of  which  are  located  in  or  near  major  metropolitan 
areas. Switching would be required if SNF cars were transported in general freight 
service.  Switching  increases  the  amount  of  handling  a  freight  car  receives.  All  else 
equal, the more a freight car has to be handled, the greater the risk of an accident. 
Second, the weight of SNF cars could increase the potential for an accident if the 
cars  were  hauled  in  general  freight  service.  The  vast  majority  of  loaded  rail  cars 
on  the  U.S.  freight  rail  network  weigh  no  more  than  286,000  pounds.4 SNF  cars, 
though,  would  weigh  approximately  400,000  pounds.  If  hauled  in  general  freight 
service,  these  extremely  heavy  SNF  cars  could  generate  high  in-train  forces,  such 
as  slack  action  (the  force  exerted  throughout  the  train  as  trains  accelerate,  decel-
erate,  and  operate  over  undulating  and  curved  terrain)  that  could  lead  to  a  derail-
ment.  Slack  action  is  much  easier  to  control  in  a  short,  dedicated  train  than  in  a 
long,  general  service  train,  especially  in  trains  with  extremely  heavy  cars  mixed 
with other normal-weight cars. 

Third,  premium  suspensions  can  be  incorporated  in  all  rail  cars  in  dedicated 
trains.  Premium  suspensions  are  higher-quality  freight  car  wheel  assemblies.  They 
reduce  lateral  wheel  forces  and  vertical  dynamic  impact  forces,  which  can  result  in 
derailments.  If  SNF  were  transported  in  general  freight  service,  there  would  be  no 
way  of  guaranteeing  that  the  cars  transporting  other  freight  would  have  premium 
suspensions.  More  generally,  dedicated  trains  eliminate  the  possibility  of  a  derail-
ment  of  an  unrelated  car  having  as  a  side  effect  the  derailment  of  or  damage  to  a 
car carrying SNF. 

Fourth,  dedicated  trains  are  essential  if  the  newest  technology  designed  to  lower 
the possibility of a derailment is to be used for SNF shipments. The AAR’s Perform-
ance  Specification  for  Trains  Used  to  Carry  High  Level  Radioactive  Material,  also 
known as S–2043, calls for additional safety requirements and technologies, includ-
ing on-board defect detection systems, premium suspensions, and electronically-con-
trolled  pneumatic  (ECP)  brakes.  ECP  brakes  function  only  when  all  cars  in  a  train 
are  equipped  with  them.  In  addition  to  providing  superior  braking  performance, 
ECP  brakes  utilize  a  communication  system  throughout  a  train  that  can  be  used 
to transmit train health information to the locomotive crew and security personnel. 
The  train  health  information,  obtained  from  the  on-board  defect  detection  systems, 
would  include  monitoring  for  known  derailment  causes  such  as  excessive  truck 
hunting; 5 rocking; 6 wheel  flats; 7 ride  quality;  defective  bearings;  vertical,  lateral 
and longitudinal acceleration; and, of course, braking performance. 

Fifth,  dedicated  trains  minimize  the  time  spent  in  transportation,  an  important 
factor for security and efficiency.8 It would take longer (possibly significantly longer) 
to  transport  SNF  from  origin  to  destination  if  SNF  were  transported  in  mixed- 
freight  trains  instead  of  dedicated  trains,  because  the  switching  of  rail  cars  in  and 
out  of  trains  takes  time  and  because  railroads  can  more  readily  schedule  dedicated 
trains to move quickly and smoothly through sensitive areas. 

Finally,  dedicated  SNF  trains  can  be  transported  with  greater  security.  Escorts, 
which are required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for all SNF move-

Yucca Mountain, ilable at p://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/news2005/pdf/doe050718rail.pdf. 

4 A  small  minority  of  rail  cars  in  general  service  weigh  up  to  315,000  pounds.  In  extremely 
rare cases (for example, movements of power plant generators), railroads will haul much heavier 
shipments. 

5 Truck  hunting  is  an  instability  at  high  speed  of  a  wheel  set  (the  ‘‘truck’’  in  railcar  termi-
nology)  causing  it  to  weave  down  the  track,  usually  with  the  flange  of  the  wheel  striking  the 
rail. 

6 Excessive lateral rocking of cars and locomotives can occur, usually at low speeds. The speed 
range at which this phenomenon occurs is determined by such factors as the wheel base, height 
of  the  center  of  gravity  of  each  individual  car  or  locomotive,  and  the  spring  dampening  associ-
ated with each vehicle’s suspension system.

ments,  will  be  able  to  monitor  SNF  much  more  easily  in  dedicated  trains  than  in 
general freight service. 

The FRA has also determined that dedicated trains for the transportation of SNF 
would  reduce  accident  risks  through  avoidance  of  yards,  reduced  derailment  poten-
tial,  and  reduced  risk  of  the  involvement  of  other  hazardous  materials  in  an  acci-
dent.9 Similarly,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  has  determined  that  dedicated 
train  transportation  of  SNF  has  operational,  safety,  security,  communications,  and 
planning advantages over transportation in general merchandise trains.10 

DOE  is  planning  to  build  the  transportation  equipment  for  the  transportation  of 
SNF  to  Yucca  Mountain  in  conformance  with  S–2043.  In  addition,  the  U.S.  Navy, 
which  currently  ships  more  SNF  than  any  other  entity,  is  currently  designing  and 
building a new freight car to meet S–2043. The prototype car is currently being test-
ed  at  the  Transportation  Technology  Center,  Inc.,  an  AAR-operated  rail  research 
and test facility in Pueblo, Colorado. 

The  rail  industry  commends  the  DOE  for  recognizing  the  benefits  of  dedicated 
trains, and commends the U.S. Navy for agreeing to conform with S–2043. However, 
despite  its  2005  policy  statement  in  favor  of  the  use  of  dedicated  trains  generally 
and  its  statement  to  the  STB  that  it  will  use  dedicated  trains  on  its  own  Yucca 
Mountain  line,  DOE  has  not  committed  to  use  dedicated  trains  for  SNF  shipments 
on  other  rail  lines,  including  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain.11 The  U.S.  Navy  has 
not  yet  agreed  to  use  dedicated  trains  for  SNF  shipments.  Railroads  respectfully 
suggest  that  policymakers  should  strongly  encourage  the  DOE  and  Navy  to  do  so. 
SNF Liability Protections Offer a Model for TIH Transport 

Railroads are confident that they could transport SNF extremely safely, and they 
are  working  hard  every  day  to  further  enhance  the  safety  of  their  operations.12 
However,  as  indicated  above,  no  firm  in  any  industry—and  certainly  not  a  rail  in-
dustry  that  has  an  outdoor  ‘‘factory  floor’’  that  is  more  than  140,000  miles  long— 
can  guarantee,  with  complete  certainty,  that  no  accident  or  terrorist  attack  will 
occur. 

Despite  all  the  precautions  that  might  be  taken,  there  is  clearly  some  risk  in-
volved  in  the  use  and  handling  of  nuclear  fuel.  Recognizing  this,  in  1957  Congress 
enacted  the  Price-Anderson  Act.  The  Price-Anderson  Act  limits  the  liability  of  a 
company (including railroads) from an incident involving the release of nuclear ma-
terial (including in transportation). The Act provides for a fund, to which all nuclear 
power  plant  licensees  contribute  when  an  incident  occurs,  to  cover  any  damages  in 
excess of required insurance levels. 

More  than  25  years  ago,  the  Interstate  Commerce  Commission  (ICC),  the  prede-
cessor of today’s Surface Transportation Board, held that the railroads’ common car-
rier  obligation  requires  them  to  transport  shipments  of  SNF,  whether  the  railroads 
want  to  handle  such  shipments  or  not.  The  ICC’s  decision  at  that  time  was  based, 
in  part,  upon  the  liability  protections  that  the  Price-Anderson  Act  afforded  to  the 
railroads. 

I would be remiss if I did not note that, likewise, because of their common carrier 
obligation,  freight  railroads—alone  among  all  modes  of  transportation—must  also 
transport TIH and other highly-hazardous materials in response to a reasonable re-
quest.  However,  the  railroads  do  not  have  any  comparable  Price-Anderson  Act  pro-
tections for this transportation. 

While  TIH  materials  are  a  small  percentage  of  total  rail  traffic—they  constitute 
only  about  0.3  percent  of  all  rail  carloads—the  transportation  of  such  materials  ex-
poses  railroads  to  significantly  higher  costs  and  potentially  ruinous  liability  due  to 
the extraordinarily dangerous characteristics of the commodities themselves. Indeed, 
an  accident  involving  TIH  could  cause  casualties  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than 
the  casualties  that  would  likely  result  from  an  accident  involving  SNF.  Accidents

dedicated  trains  for  all  transportation  of  SNF  to  the  Yucca  Mountain  line.  DOE  has  opposed 
that condition, saying only that it will maintain its policy (cited at footnote 3 above) to use dedi-

means to enhance rail safety.

involving  TIH  on  railroads  are  extremely  rare.  However,  history  demonstrates  that 
railroads could be subjected to multi-billion dollar claims—even for accidents where 
they do nothing wrong.13 

Moreover,  the  revenues  that  highly-hazardous  materials  generate  do  not  come 
close  to  covering  the  potential  liability  to  railroads  associated  with  this  traffic.  Nor 
can  railroads  fully  insure  against  the  multi-billion  dollar  risks  associated  with  TIH 
shipments.14 This places railroads in an untenable situation. 

Given  these  points,  I  respectfully  submit  that  if  there  is  a  public  interest  need 
for  railroads  to  be  compelled  to  carry  TIH  materials  similar  to  that  requiring  them 
to  carry  SNF,  there  is  a  corresponding  public  interest  need  for  the  rail  industry  to 
be able to take into account and protect itself against the increased risk and poten-
tially ruinous liability exposure associated with transporting TIH materials—just as 
railroads  (and  others)  are  protected  to  a  limited  degree  from  liabilities  associated 
with SNF. 

This  can  be  achieved  if  policymakers  enact  a  Price-Anderson  type  solution.  The 
AAR  has  a  legislative  proposal  which  would  effect  a  Price-Anderson  type  solution 
for  TIH  transport  and  would  be  pleased  to  discuss  it  further  with  the  Committee. 
Conclusion 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify.  Nothing  is  more  important  to  railroads 
than the safety of their employees, their customers, and the communities they serve. 
The  railroad  industry  is  committed  to  working  with  its  employees,  Congress,  the 
FRA, its customers, and others to ensure that rail safety continues to improve. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  I  want  to  thank  the  panel  and  I  will  ask  a  few 
questions and let Senator Thune ask a few questions. And if I have 
other followup, I will continue with that. 

I want to follow up on some of the questions that I asked in the 
first  panel  about  the  accidents  and  a  few  of  you  have  had  some 
comments on that. 

First  of  all,  Dr.  Crowley,  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  can 
you  address  the  full-scale  models  versus  what  DOE  has  been  test-
ing  and  why  you  think  that  full-scale  models  are  important  to  do? 
Dr.  CROWLEY.  I  would  be  happy  to  do  that.  And  it  is  not  testing 
full-scale models. It is actually testing the articles that are used to 
transport the spent fuel. 

There  have  been  many  tests  carried  out  on  full-scale  articles 
around  the  world.  They  include  the  regulatory  tests.  For  example, 
one  of  the  tests  that  shipping  packages  are  required  to  pass  is  a 
drop  of  9  meters  onto  an  unyielding  surface,  which  actually,  in 
terms of the impact forces on the canisters, is more severe than you 
are likely to see in any kind of a collision. 

In addition, in the 1970s, Sandia National Laboratory carried out 
a  number  of  tests  where  they  crashed  casks,  full-scale  casks,  on 
trailers and trucks and trains against unyielding barriers, and they 
actually  crashed  a  canister  on  a  trailer  with  a  train.  Those  can-
isters  are  designs  that  are  no  longer  used  today.  So  those  are  not 
really applicable to current-day standards. 

In  addition,  in  the  U.K.,  the  Electricity  Generating  Board  in  the 
1980s  conducted  a  test  where  they  put  one  of  their  canisters  on  a 

13 For  example,  a  few  years  ago  in  New  Orleans,  a  tank  car  that  railroads  did  not  own  con-
taining  more  than  30,000  gallons  of  liquid  butadiene  began  to  leak.  Vapor  from  the  butadiene 
tank  car  rolled  out  across  a  neighborhood  until  the  pilot  light  of  an  outdoor  gas  water  heater 
ignited it. More than 900 people were evacuated, though no one was killed or seriously injured. 
The  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  found  that  the  probable  cause  of  the  accident  was 
an  improper  gasket  that  a  chemical  company  had  installed  on  the  tank  car.  Nevertheless,  a 
state court jury entered a punitive damages verdict against the railroads involved in the amount 
of $2.8 billion. 

14 Although  TIH  materials  account  for  only  0.3  percent  of  rail  carloads,  the  absolute  number 
of carloads—some 100,000 per year—is 250 times higher than the number of expected SNF car-
loads. The use of dedicated trains is feasible for a commodity like SNF where very few carloads 
are involved, but is not feasible for TIH.

train, on a flat car, turned the flat car on its side, put it across the 
track,  and  crashed  a  very  heavy  locomotive  into  that  canister  at 
about 100 miles an hour. 

So those are the kinds of tests that have been carried out. 
Let me make one other comment. From an impact point of view, 
these packages are very robust, and as I said before, the regulatory 
tests  that  these  canisters  have  to  go  through  are  more  rigorous 
than what you are likely to see in a real-world accident. 

That  is  not  necessarily  the  case  for  severe  fires.  There  is  a  30- 
minute,  fully  engulfing  test  that  is  required  as  part  of  the  regula-
tion. As you pointed out earlier, there are certainly fires that burn 
for  periods  on  the  order  of  much  longer  than  30  minutes.  In  fact, 
I  forget  when  exactly  it  was.  It  was  in  the  1970s  or  1980s  in  the 
U.K..  There  was  a  very,  very  severe  tunnel  fire  with  petrol  cars 
that burned for several days. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  Did  we  not  have  something  in  Baltimore  as 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  We  had  a  Baltimore  fire  as  well,  but  that  only 

burned for a few hours. So this fire was much—— 

well? 

that? 

Senator ENSIGN. It is still longer than 30 minutes. 
Dr.  CROWLEY.  It  is  much  longer  than  30  minutes.  That  is  right. 
As  a  consequence  of  that  U.K.  fire,  the  U.K.  Department  of 
Transport  prohibited  the  carriage  of  spent  fuel  trains  with  flam-
mable materials or passing other trains in tunnels. 

And  I  should  say  for  the  Baltimore  tunnel  fire,  whether  or  not 
this package is fully engulfed is really important. If you, for exam-
ple,  just  have  an  end  of  the  package  that  goes  into  the  fire,  the 
heat  can  conduct  away.  So  you  really  need  to  put  the  entire  pack-
age  in  the  fire  and  it  needs  to  be  maintained  for  a  long  period  of 
time  to  see  the  kind  of  impact  that  you  might  be  concerned  about. 

Senator ENSIGN. And that kind of testing has not been done. 
Dr. CROWLEY. To my knowledge, it has not been done. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  Anybody  else  want  to  make  any  comments  on 

[No response.] 
Senator  ENSIGN.  Maybe,  Dr.  Ballard,  you  have  studied—obvi-
ously,  based  on  what  the  terrorists  did  on  9/11,  they  looked  for 
weaknesses.  I  mean,  do  you  not  think  that  they  would  look—you 
said  you  have  to  put  the  mind  of  a  terrorist  on,  not  the  mind  of 
a  regulator  or  a  government  oversight  official.  The  mind  of  a  ter-
rorist  is  going  to  look  for  the  weaknesses  there.  If  they  are  going 
to  try  to  attack  one  of  these,  do  you  not  think  that  would  be  one 
of the things they would try to replicate? 

Dr.  BALLARD.  Well,  across  the  United  States,  we  will  see  lots  of 
geographic  locations  that  would  enhance  an  attack,  a  tunnel,  a 
bridge,  et  cetera.  I  live  in  Santa  Clarita,  and  we  recently  had  a 
tunnel  fire  there  that  was  a  very  significant  incident.  It  was  a  se-
ries  of  trucks  that  on  a  very  rainy  day  got  together  in  the  tunnel, 
and  they  melted  the  frames  of  the  trucks.  Now,  was  it  a  fully  en-
gulfing  fire?  If  a  cask  had  been  in  that  tunnel,  what  would  have 
happened?  The  difference  between  a  rail  cask  and  its  robustness 
and  a  truck  cask  and  its  robustness—all  of  those  should  be  tested 
using  full-scale  testing  models,  and  we  have  not  done  that,  as  far

as  I  know,  to  date,  and  I  think  the  testimony  today  kind  of  sup-
ports that. 

Senator ENSIGN. Ms. Schubert, in your testimony, you have been 
able  to  find  these  transportation  routes.  How  easy  would  it  be  for 
a  terrorist  to  kind  of  get  these  transportation  routes  and  be  able 
to set up what they would believe an ideal place to attack? 

Ms. SCHUBERT. It took us just looking at the basic maps and the 
EIS and then going in and getting some GIS data and putting lay-
ers on it. So it was not that difficult. It took some time and a little 
bit of effort, but these are the DOE maps just with additional infor-
mation  fleshed  out  so  people  have  a  better  idea  of  what  is  going 
on. 

And I think it is important to point out, although we are talking 
mostly rail and probably truck, we are also talking barge transport, 
which  is  very  slow-moving  barges  with  large  casks  on  them  which 
are  going  to  be  very  obvious  to  anybody  who  is  looking  for  some-
thing like that. 

Senator ENSIGN. The last question has to do with on-site storage. 
You mentioned, Dr. Crowley, that onsite storage is a pretty proven 
technology  today.  The  security—obviously,  you  do  not  have  to 
worry  about  transportation  with  onsite  storage.  I  do  not  know  if 
you have expertise in this field, but are you familiar with how long 
is on-site storage or what are the best guesses for how long on-site 
dry cask storage would be safe? 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  Well,  actually  my  organization  has  also  published 

on that aspect as well, so I can talk about that. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  I  knew  they  had.  I  did  not  know  whether  you 

were familiar with this. 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  Yes.  I  was  actually  also  study  director  of  that  re-

port. 

choice. 

Senator ENSIGN. OK. 
Dr.  CROWLEY.  First  of  all,  let  me  say  that  whether  or  not  you 
store something onsite or you transport it to a repository is a policy 
choice. 

Senator ENSIGN. Correct. 
Dr.  CROWLEY.  We  all  understand  that.  This  is  not  a  technical 

choice. It is a policy choice. 

As far as storage onsite, you can in principle—— 
Senator  ENSIGN.  By  the  way,  some  people  think  it  is  a  technical 

Dr. CROWLEY. It is not a technical choice. 
Senator  ENSIGN.  My  colleagues  do  not  understand  that.  They  do 
not understand what you just said. They think it is a policy choice. 
They think you cannot store it safely onsite. That is the reason ev-
erybody wants to get it out of their back yards. 

Dr. CROWLEY. Well, let me just make a couple of comments about 
that  because  the  answer  to  your  question  is  not  a  simple  answer. 
From  a  technical  point  of  view,  you  can  store  that  stuff  forever 
onsite.  From  a  technical  point  of  view.  What  you  have  to  worry 
about is loss of institutional control, loss of institutional will to con-
tinue to take care of that material. If you put it into dry cask stor-
age  technology,  which  is  what  you  can  do  after  about  5  years,  you 
can  maintain  that  on  a  concrete  pad.  You  have  got  to  keep  the 
casks painted, and maybe after 100 years or so, you might actually

86 

have  to  bring  the  fuel  out  of  the  cask  and  replace  the  cask.  You 
could continue to do that forever. 

However, those—— 
Senator ENSIGN. But it probably good for at least 100 years. 
Dr. CROWLEY. That is correct. In fact, we have said that. 
However,  the  nuclear  plants  will  not  operate  for  100  years,  and 
so  after  some  period  of  time,  those  plants  will  be  gone  and  that 
spent fuel will be stranded at the site. When you have an operating 
plant,  the  owner  of  the  plant  has  an  economic  imperative  to  take 
care  of  that  fuel.  Once  the  plant  is  gone,  that  economic  imperative 
is gone. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  Unless  the  Federal  Government  takes  title  to 

that onsite. That is a policy question, not a technical question. 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  That  would  be  a  policy  choice.  That  is  right,  yes. 
Senator ENSIGN. Anybody else want to comment on that? 
Dr.  BALLARD.  Senator  Ensign,  one  of  the  things  that  we  have 
talked  here  today  about  is  that  transporting  the  material  induces 
or  increases  the  risk.  We  actually  have  examples  of  this.  On  Feb-
ruary  4th,  1985,  there  was  a  threat  against  a  shipment  campaign, 
and that threat was that they would crash a plane into a shipment 
container.  That  was  called  in  to  a  corporate  headquarters  for  the 
power  plant.  It  is  reported  in  the  NRC’s  SSEL  document.  So  we 
have  at  least  an  incident  of  somebody  threatening  one  of  these 
shipments. 

What is not in the SSEL is another significant incident, and that 
was in Golden Valley, Minnesota on October 27, 1986, where a 39- 
foot  section  of  track  was  removed  ahead  of  a  train  that  was  car-
rying  SNF.  Fortunately,  I  should  say,  the  shipment  was  routed— 
a different train was routed ahead of it. It derailed. It was carrying 
lumber, and so we did not have a significant incident at that time. 
We  do  think  that  this  is  related  because  right  on  the  wall  near 
where  this  track  was  removed  was  the  slogan:  ‘‘Stop  rad  waste 
shipments.’’  This  incident  is  not  in  the  NRC’s  official  SSEL.  It  is 
not documented as a potential threat. 

So  the  point  here  is  transporting  materials  adds  new  threats.  It 
brings  out  new  adversaries  with  that  creative  capability  of  trying 
to stop whatever they wish to. 
Senator ENSIGN. Thank you. 
Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator  THUNE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you, 

panel, for your insights and your input. 

I  am  very  interested  in  the  energy  issues.  I  have  been  involved 
with those since arriving here. And I think it is probably one of the 
big  challenges  our  country  faces.  It  strikes  me  that  there  are  lots 
of things that we should probably be doing more of to help address 
the  issue  of  energy  independence.  We  get  about  19  percent  of  our 
power from nuclear, about 50 percent from coal. 

And  if  you  consider  the  various  policy  goals  that  are  sort  of  laid 
out as we head into the future, one is increasing the use of electric 
hybrid  cars,  which  means  we  are  going  to  have  additional  demand 
for  electricity,  which  is  going  to  stretch  the  supply  that  we  cur-

87 

rently have, and it gets into whole other issues of transmission ca-
pability  and  whatnot.  But  there  is  also  the  goal  of  limiting  carbon 
emissions, and that too is something that nuclear energy could help 
address, being a clean fuel. 

So  I  guess  the  question  I  have  is  we  have  seen  in  other  parts  of 
the world—France, for example, I am told 80 percent of their elec-
tric  power  comes  from  nuclear.  Why  is  it  that  it  has  not  taken  off 
more  in  this  country?  And  I  think  many  of  the  issues  that  are 
being discussed today are perhaps part of that. 

But tell me, if you can, whoever would care to answer this ques-
tion who has any experience or knowledge with the issues of trans-
porting  spent  fuel  in  other  countries  of  the  world  where  nuclear  is 
a  much  bigger  part  of  the  energy  supply  than  it  is  here  in  the 
United  States  and  have  they  experienced  some  of  the  same  issues 
and how do they address those. 

My  number  here  says  1,500  commercial  shipments  of  spent  fuel 
since  1979—I  guess,  Director  Weber  had  testified  to  this—without 
incident.  How  do  you  compare  the  logistical  and  technical  chal-
lenges that we face with these shipments here in this country with 
those  in  other  places  around  the  world  where  nuclear  is  a  bigger 
in terms of the power supply? 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  Well,  I  will  take  an  initial  crack  at  that.  As  part 
of  our  Going  the  Distance  study,  we  actually  went  to  Europe  and 
we talked to officials who were involved with and citizens who were 
concerned about transportation of spent fuel. 

As it turns out, in Europe, at least until recently, there has been 
a great deal more spent fuel transportation. The Honorable Edward 
Sproat talked about 3,000 shipments. There have been on the order 
of  tens  of  thousands  of  shipments  in  Europe.  And  the  reason  for 
that  is  that  until  recently,  fuel  was  not  stored  very  long  in  the 
spent  fuel  pools  at  the  powerplants.  Rather,  that  fuel  was  sent  to 
be  reprocessed  both  in  the  U.K.  and  in  France.  And  so  they  have 
very routine shipments of fuel. Those routine shipments go through 
very  large  cities.  And  there  are  citizens  over  there  who  are  con-
cerned  about  that,  but  the  consensus  in  those  countries  seemed  to 
be that that is OK. 

Recently the number of shipments have decreased as the reproc-
essing activity has gone down, and now more plants are storing the 
fuel on their sites rather than sending it for reprocessing. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  Why  has  the  reprocessing  activity  gone  down? 
Dr. CROWLEY. Well, there have been a number of reasons. In the 
U.K.,  one  of  the  plants,  the  Thor  plant  which  is  used  to  reprocess 
oxide fuel, sprung a leak, and so it has been shut down. 

Germany  has  encountered  a  lot  of  resistance  in  transporting 
spent fuel actually. At one point, they had to call out 30,000 police 
to  protect  a  spent  fuel  shipment  against  protesters.  So  they  have 
made  a  policy  decision  to  store  that  material  at  the  powerplant 
sites,  and  all  of  the  powerplants  have  been  required  to  build  stor-
age buildings for that material. 

Other countries in Europe have just decided that it is too expen-
sive  to  send  the  fuel  for  reprocessing,  and  they  have  stopped.  Not 
all countries, but some countries have just stopped. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  What  is  Japan  doing  now?  Did  they  not  just 

build a reprocessing plant?

88 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  Japan  has  been  sending  its  spent  fuel  to  Europe 
to  be  reprocessed,  but  they  did  just  recently  build  a  reprocessing 
facility and they will reprocess their fuel domestically. 

Senator THUNE. Could you answer the question as to—one of the 
issues, of course, with transportation and basically the whole Yucca 
Mountain  thing  of  getting  rid  of  nuclear  waste  as  opposed  to  stor-
ing,  all  those  things  we  have  debated  here  for  a  long  time—and 
Senator  Ensign  and  his  colleagues  from  Nevada  have  some  strong 
views about the whole Yucca Mountain issue. 

But one of the things that we—I have been working with a bipar-
tisan group of Senators who are trying to develop a comprehensive 
energy  policy  which  includes  more  incentives  for  nuclear  power  in 
this  country.  And  one  of  the  things  that  we  addressed  was  the 
Carter  era  ban  on  reprocessing  spent  fuel.  And  basically  what  we 
called for was a demonstration facility to develop spent fuel reproc-
essing. 

And I guess my question in that regard is, why is that not some-
thing  in  this  country  that  we  have  been  more  acceptant  of?  That 
is  clearly  something  that  in  the  countries  that  you  just  mentioned 
they have supported. Why is it that we cannot be developing more 
nuclear  power  in  this  country  instead  of  dealing  with  it  and  dis-
posing  of  it  at  a  place  like  Yucca  Mountain,  which  is  very  con-
troversial?  And  I  realize  the  ban  is  very  controversial  too.  But  I 
would  be  interested  in  your  thoughts  on  that,  Dr.  Crowley,  about 
why  that  is  not  something  that  would  not  be  now,  it  seems  to  me 
at least, more acceptable in this country. 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  Well,  as  it  turns  out,  when  the  first  generation  of 
commercial  nuclear  plants  were  built  in  this  country,  the  concept 
was to reprocess the spent fuel, and that is one of the reasons that 
those  plants  have  such  small  spent  fuel  pools.  The  idea  was  to 
store that fuel in the pools for just some matter of months and then 
send  it  off  to  be  reprocessed.  And  there  were  two  or  three  reproc-
essing plants that were built or planned to be built in the country. 
They  ran  into  a  number  of  technical  problems  and  none  of  those 
plants—well, one plant in West Valley was operated for a short pe-
riod of time, but none of the other plants were operated. 

Carter  did  in,  I  think  it  was,  1977,  ban  reprocessing.  On  the 
other  hand,  Reagan  overturned  that  ban  in  the  early  1980s,  and 
yet  no  reprocessing  plants  were  built.  And  I  think  at  that  point  it 
was a matter of economics. 

Right  now  the  price  of  uranium  is  fairly  inexpensive,  and  if  you 
are  an  operator  of  a  nuclear  plant,  it  is  much  cheaper  for  you  to 
buy  fresh  spent  fuel  and  to  store  that  fuel  with  the  idea  that  you 
would eventually send it off to be disposed of than it is to reprocess 
that  fuel.  And  I  think  that  is  the  reason  that  you  are  not  seeing 
a lot of activity for reprocessing in the United States. 

Now,  as  you  know,  there  has  been  recent  interest  in  reprocess-
ing,  and  I  know  that  one  of  the  French  companies  has  asserted 
that, in fact, it is economical to reprocess. But I have not reviewed 
that material, and so I do not really have an opinion on that. 

But historically it has been false starts early on and now econom-

Senator THUNE. Well, that is good to know. I did not realize that 
economics played that big of a role in that. It just seems like if that 

ics.

is something that we could open up a little bit, but if it is, in fact, 
not  going  to  be  economical  for  companies  to  do  that—it  seems  to 
me  that  it  bears  on  the  whole  issue  of  transportation  too  because 
my  assumption  is  if  you  have  reprocessing  plants  different  places, 
it probably limits the amount of transportation that is necessary to 
get  everything  out  to  Yucca  or  someplace  for  disposal  like  that.  I 
would  assume  those  would  be  all  around  the  country  and  would 
minimize  the  distance  that  some  of  the  spent  fuel  would  have  to 
be transported. 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  Well,  let  me  make  a  couple  of  comments  about 
that.  Right  now,  as  you  know,  the  owners  of  nuclear  power  plants 
are spending a tenth of a penny per kilowatt hour to get their fuel 
disposed  of,  and  it  is  the  Government’s  responsibility  to  dispose  of 
that  fuel.  So  I  think  from  the  perspective  of  the  commercial  spent 
fuel  owners,  they  would  say,  hey,  we  have  already  paid  for  this. 
Why should we pay twice? 

Reprocessing  plants  are  very  expensive.  Japan  spent  over  $20 
billion  on  its  reprocessing  plant.  I  forget  what  its  capacity  is.  Sev-
eral  hundred  or  a  couple  of  thousand  of  metric  tons  per  year.  So 
it would be very expensive to build a lot of reprocessing plants. 

Senator  THUNE.  You  do  not  see  then  multiple  reprocessing 

Dr. CROWLEY. Certainly not initially, no. 
And  then  also,  reprocessing  does  not  eliminate  the  need  for  dis-
posal. You are going to reprocess the fuel. You are going to recover 
its useful components, but the waste still has to go somewhere. You 
could store it onsite at the reprocessing plant. Some of the shorter- 
lived radioactivity would decay away, but there would be a longer- 
lived component that would have to be disposed of eventually. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  The  volume  is  tremendously  less,  though.  Is  it 

plants. 

not? 

Dr. CROWLEY. Not necessarily. It depends on the reprocessing ap-
proach  that  you  use.  The  current  approach,  which  is  based  on 
PUREX,  would  not  reduce  the  volume.  The  Department  of  Energy 
is trying to develop advanced reprocessing technologies. They claim 
it  would  reduce  the  volume.  And  the  other  thing  that  that  would 
do for you would be to allow you to separate out the different kinds 
of  radioactivity.  So  a  lot  of  it  you  could  just  store  for  a  couple  of 
hundred years to decay. 

Senator ENSIGN. Is that the accelerator technology that they are 

talking about? 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  Well,  they  are  talking  about—instead  of  PUREX, 
it  is  called  UREX.  It  is  just  an  advanced  reprocessing  that  allows 
you  to  take  the  spent  fuel,  dissolve  it,  and  separate  out  its  compo-
nents. 

Now,  there  is  another  option  when  you  can  take  some  of  the 
long-lived components of the fuel, put it into a reactor or an accel-
erator, and transmute it to reduce its long-term toxicity. 
Senator ENSIGN. That is more theoretical still. Right? 
Dr.  CROWLEY.  Exactly.  That  is  not  ready  for  deployment  at  this 

point. 

Senator ENSIGN. Right. That is what I understand. 
I want to thank the panel.

Also,  just  one  last  comment.  Also,  it  had  to  do  with  weapons- 
grade plutonium was the reason I think Carter stopped the reproc-
essing  as  well,  although  it  looks  like  Europe  and  Japan  have  an-
swered  that.  From  what  I  understand  vitrification  takes  care  of 
that  problem.  It  makes  it  unusable  to  ever  have  weapons-grade 
plutonium. 

Dr.  CROWLEY.  That  is  not  actually  true.  What  they  are  doing  is 
separating  out  the  fission  products,  and  that  material  has  no  use 
other than to a terrorist who might want to build a dirty bomb. But 
the  plutonium  is  actually  being  separated  out  and  it  is  being 
stored.  And  that  is  a  real  concern.  We  are  not  so  concerned  when 
countries  like  France  and  the  UK  and  Japan  do  that  because  they 
are  allies,  but  we  would  be  very  concerned  if  other  countries  that 
were not allies started to do that. 

Senator  ENSIGN.  In  this  issue,  we  are  just  talking  about  it  here 

in this country. 

So,  listen,  it  has  been  a  fascinating  couple  of  panels.  I  want  to 
thank both panels for your expert testimony, and we will see where 
this  leads.  Hopefully,  it  will  not  lead  to  Yucca  Mountain.  Thank 
you.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. EDWARD F. SPROAT III 

Question. The DOE will have the authority to begin shipments to Yucca Mountain 
if  the  NRC  approves  the  license  application  for  construction  authorization,  which 
could  very  quickly  lead  to  the  large  quantities  of  nuclear  waste  being  shipped  to 
Yucca  Mountain.  What  steps  has  the  DOE  taken  to  prepare  the  public  for  the  in-
crease  in  these  shipments?  Has  the  DOE  been  actively  addressing  public  concerns 
over these shipments? 

Answer. Since passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) in 1982, DOE has 
been  working  with  its  stakeholders  to  identify,  address,  and  resolve  issues  of  con-
cern related to the transport of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
DOE has worked with law enforcement, emergency response, and public safety offi-
cials  from  potentially  impacted  States,  Tribes,  and  local  governments  to  commu-
nicate  information  about  spent  nuclear  fuel  transportation.  As  specific  concerns  arc 
identified,  DOE  has  addressed  them  through  outreach  programs  and  in  discussions 
at Transportation External Coordination Working Group conferences. DOE has also 
maintained  cooperative  agreements  with  State  Regional  Groups  (e.g.,  the  Western 
Interstate  Energy  Board),  public  safety  organizations  (e.g.,  the  Commercial  Vehicle 
Safety Alliance), and legislative organizations (e.g., the National Conference of State 
Legislatures), all specifically for the purpose of addressing concerns and helping cor-
ridor communities prepare for the planned shipments. DOE additionally has respon-
sibilities under Section 180(c) of the NWPA to provide funding and technical assist-
ance for training to states and tribes and will make such funding available. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BARBARA BOXER TO 

HON. EDWARD F. SPROAT III 

Question  1.  When  will  routes  and  shipment  schedules  be  established?  Will  the 

public have access to the route information? If not, why not? 

Answer. The selection of truck routes will be made in accordance with DOT rout-
ing  regulations  set  forth  in  Title  49  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations.  The  selec-
tion of railroad routes will be the responsibility of the carriers, as specified in Title 
49  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations.  DOE  is  working  with  stakeholders  to  estab-
lish  routing  criteria  and  will  work  in  close  cooperation  with  the  carriers  to  ensure 
that  routes  selected  will  be  safe,  secure,  and  efficient.  Authorized  officials  will  be 
provided  specific  routes  and  shipping  schedules  as  part  of  the  NRC  required  pre- 
notifications  that  will  be  made  before  each  shipment.  Specific  routes  and  shipping 
schedules will not he available to the general public for security reasons. 

Question  2.  How  much  of  the  spent  nuclear  fuel  are  you  expecting  to  be  trans-
ported over highways rather than rail? Are TAD canisters being developed that can 
be transported by tractor trailers? 

Answer.  DOE  estimates  about  10  percent  of  the  spent  nuclear  fuel  to  Yucca 
Mountain will be shipped by truck. The TAD canisters currently being designed will 
be shipped to the repository using rail. 

Question 3. How will the Department of Energy ensure the security of shipments 

to Yucca Mountain? 

Answer.  The  Department  is  committed  to  ensuring  the  security  of  shipments  to 
Yucca  Mountain  and  will  meet  or  exceed  the  level  of  security  provided  by  following 
the  current  regulations  and  additional  measures  put  in  place  by  the  Nuclear  Regu-
latory  Commission,  the  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT),  and  the  Department 
of Homeland Security. 

DOE  coordinates  with  these  entities  to  continually  assess  potential  developments 
that  could  affect  security.  In  addition,  DOE  will  work  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal

92 

and  local  law  enforcement,  as  appropriate,  to  fulfill  our  shared  responsibilities  for 
spent nuclear fuel transportation safety. 

Question  4.  Why  has  DOE  not  analyzed  which  specific  rail  and  truck  routes  to 
Yucca  Mountain  have  the  least  risk  of  accident  and/or  sabotage  and  the  least  risk 
of environmental, economic, and human health impacts in the event of accident and/ 
or sabotage? 

Answer.  Under  applicable  regulations  specific  routing  selections  cannot  be  made 
until  nearer  to  he  time  of  shipments.  Nevertheless,  in  its  NEPA  documentation  re-
lating  to  the  Yucca  Mountain  repository,  DOE  has  analyzed  representative  routes 
and has also analyzed the risk of accidents, transportation sabotage considerations, 
and consequences of potential sabotage events. 

Question  5.  Why  shouldn’t  the  analysis  of  the  relative  risks  of  specific  rail  routes 
be done now, prior to licensing, instead of after licensing? When will DOE complete 
such an analysis? 

Answer.  Under  applicable  DOT  regulations,  specific  trucking  and  rail  routing  de-
cisions cannot be made until nearer the time of shipments. Under those regulations, 
specific rail routing decisions will be made by the rail carriers pursuant to the regu-
lations in effect at the time of the shipments. 

As a general matter, however, the DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safe-
ty Administration. in coordination with the Federal Railroad Administration and the 
Transportation Security Administration, has recently issued a final rule revising re-
quirements  in  the  Hazardous  Materials  Regulations  applicable  to  the  safe  and  se-
cure transportation of certain hazardous materials transported in commerce by rail. 
The final rule requires rail carriers to compile annual data on these shipments, use 
the data to analyze safety and security risks along rail routes where those materials 
are  transported,  assess  alternative  routing  options,  and  make  routing  decisions 
based  on  those  assessments  to  select  the  safest  and  most  secure  practicable  route. 
Under  the  new  rule,  the  railroad  carriers  are  developing  their  processes  for  con-
ducting these assessments, on a national scale, taking into account the many thou-
sands  of  shipments  of  toxic  gases,  explosives,  and  poisons  that  must  be  handled 
safely  and  securely  every  day.  DOE  is  monitoring  how  rail  shippers  and  carriers  of 
such  toxic  materials  are  implementing  this  new  rule.  DOE  is  also  working  with 
DOT  and  the  railroads  to  better  understand  how  such  assessments  arc  to  be  con-
ducted,  and  how  spent  nuclear  fuel  shipments  need  to  be  considered  in  such  anal-
yses. 

Question  6.  Will  DOE  contractually  bind  carriers  it  contracts  with  to  use  those 

rail routes that DOE has determined to be safest? If not, why not? 

Answer.  DOT’s  new  rail  routing  rules  require  the  carriers  to  use  the  routes  the 
carriers consider safest and most secure, subject to DOT’s review. DOE contract in-
corporate DOE Directives that require DOE contractors to follow these and all other 
applicable DOT regulations when transporting material on behalf of DOE. 

Question  7.  When  does  DOE  plan  to  perform  an  environmental  review  under  the 
National  Environmental  Policy  Act  for  its  National  Transportation  Plan  and  Na-
tional Operational Plan? 

Answer.  In  2002,  DOE  issued  its  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  a 
Geologic  Repository  for  the  Disposal  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  and  High-Level  Radio-
active Waste at Yucca Mountain, Nye County, Nevada, DOE/EIS–0250F, and in 2008 
issued its final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for a Geologic Repos-
itory  for  the  Disposal  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  and  High-Level  Radioactive  Waste  at 
Yucca Mountain, Nye County, Nevada—Nevada Rail Transportation Corridor, DOE/ 
EIS–0250F–S–2 and its final Environmental Impact Statement for a Rail Alignment 
for the Construction and Operation of a Railroad in Nevada to a Geologic Repository 
at Yucca Mountain, Nye County, Nevada, DOE/EIS–0369. These documents analyze 
the  potential  impacts  associated  with  the  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  and 
high-level radioactive waste to the Yucca Mountain repository. The National Trans-
portation  Plan  and  National  Operation  Plan  that  will  be  developed  are  planning 
documents that implement the proposed action which was already analyzed in these 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents. DOE would conduct supple-
mental  NEPA  review  if  DOE  makes  substantial  changes  in  the  proposed  action  or 
there  are  significant  new  circumstances  or  information  relevant  to  environmental 
concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impact. 

Question  8.  Will  DOE  require  that  all  nuclear  waste  shipped  by  rail  to  Yucca 
Mountain  be  carried  in  dedicated  trains,  or  will  it  allow  some  nuclear  waste  to  be 
shipped in general freight service? Will DOE analyze and compare the risk between 
a  dedicated  train  and  general  freight  service,  particularly  as  to  railroad  route  seg-
ments that present particular challenges to longer trains?

Answer.  In  July  2005,  DOE  adopted  a  policy  to  use  dedicated  trains  as  its  usual 
mode  of  rail  transportation  for  shipments  of  commercial  spent  nuclear  fuel  and 
high-level radioactive waste to the Yucca Mountain repository. In adopting this pol-
icy, however, DOE has recognized that such materials can be shipped safely regard-
less of mode and regardless of type of service due primarily to the stringent regula-
tions in place and the robust nature of the transport packages involved. In adopting 
the  policy,  DOE  has  additionally  identified  the  primary  benefit  of  using  dedicated 
trains  to  be  the  significant  costs  savings  over  the  lifetime  of  the  Yucca  Mountain 
Program.  However,  there  may  also  be  circumstances  where  general  freight  service 
would  be  more  appropriate  to  promote  costs  savings,  operational  flexibility  and/or 
efficiency for shipments to the Yucca Mountain repository. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. HARRY REID TO 

HON. EDWARD F. SPROAT III 

Question  1.  If  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  is  able  to  maintain  its  current 
schedule  for  licensing  and  building  the  Yucca  Mountain  nuclear  waste  repository, 
when  is  the  soonest  you  could  begin  transporting  nuclear  waste?  Would  the  DOE 
consider shipping nuclear waste prior to completing construction at Yucca? 

Answer.  Under  the  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act,  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE) 
could  not  begin  transporting  spent  nuclear  fuel  and  high-level  radioactive  waste  to 
the  Yucca  Mountain  repository  until  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC) 
issues  a  construction  authorization  license  and  a  repository  license  to  receive  and 
possess spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste for disposal. Under cur-
rent  planning,  the  earliest  date  that  DOE  anticipates  that  it  would  begin  trans-
porting waste to the Yucca Mountain repository is 2020. 

Question 2. In 2007, the DOE officially gave Congress draft legislation that would 
abolish  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT),  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission 
(NRC), Surface Transportation Board, and state authority over transportation of nu-
clear  waste.  Does  the  DOE  still  support  this  legislation?  Will  the  DOE  be  able  to 
ship waste if Congress does not eliminate these other agencies’ authorities over nu-
clear waste shipments? 

Answer. The Department supports the proposed legislation which would not abol-
ish or otherwise change the existing authority of DOT, NRC, the Surface Transpor-
tation  Board,  states  and  other  entities  over  transportation  of  nuclear  waste  by  or 
on  behalf  of  DOE.  Rather,  Section  7  of  the  proposed  legislation  would  clarify  the 
manner in which the Department may exercise its existing authority to regulate the 
safety  and  security  of  transportation  of  radioactive  materials  to  Yucca  Mountain. 
DOE has broad authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA), 
to  regulate  all  aspects  of  activities  involving  radioactive  materials  that  are  under-
taken by DOE or on its behalf, including the transportation of radioactive materials. 
DOE exercises this authority to regulate certain DOE shipments, such as shipments 
undertaken by governmental employees or shipments involving national security. In 
most cases where DOE utilizes commercial carriers, however, DOE does not exercise 
its AEA authority but rather relies on regulation of these shipments by DOT, NRC 
and  other  entities  as  appropriate.  With  respect  to  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain, 
DOE currently plans to use commercial carriers regulated by DOT. 

As  a  policy  matter  and  without  regard  to  which  agency  exercises  regulatory  au-
thority,  DOE  requires  shipments  by  it  or  on  its  behalf  to  be  undertaken  in  accord-
ance  with  the  requirements  and  standards  that  apply  to  comparable  commercial 
shipments,  except  where  there  is  a  determination  that  national  security  or  another 
critical  interest  requires  different  action.  This  policy  is  set  forth  in  DOE  Orders 
460.1B,  Packaging  and  Transportation  Safety,  460.2A,  Departmental  Materials 
Transportation  and  Packaging  Management,  and  470.4A,  Safeguards  and  Security 
Program,  as  well  as  DOE  Manual  460.2–IA,  Radioactive  Material  Transportation 
Practices  Manual.  In  implementing  this  policy,  DOE  will  cooperate  with  Federal, 
State,  local  and  Tribal  entities  and  utilize  existing  expertise  and  resources  to  the 
extent practicable. In all cases, DOE is committed to achieving a level of protection 
that meets or exceeds the level of protection associated with comparable commercial 
shipments regulated by DOT and NRC. 

Question  3.  CSX  Transportation  recently  expressed  concern  that  the  DOE  could 
be  reversing  its  plan  to  use  dedicated  railcars  for  shipping  spent  nuclear  fuel.  CSX 
stated  that  the  DOE  is  now  stressing  the  need  for  ‘‘flexibility’’  so  they  can  reserve 
the option of shipping spent fuel together with other commercial items. Is the DOE 
reversing its position and if so, why does the DOE now think it is safe to transport 
commercial and nuclear shipments together?

Answer.  In  July  2005,  DOE  adopted  a  policy  to  use  dedicated  trains  as  its  usual 
service  mode  of  rail  transportation  for  shipments  of  commercial  spent  nuclear  fuel 
and  high-level  radioactive  waste  to  the  Yucca  Mountain  repository,  and  that  policy 
has  not  changed.  In  adopting  the  policy,  DOE  has  recognized  that  such  materials 
can  be  shipped  safely  regardless  of  mode  and  regardless  of  type  of  service  due  pri-
marily  to  the  stringent  regulations  in  place  and  the  robust  nature  of  the  transport 
packages  involved.  In  adopting  the  policy,  DOE  has  additionally  identified  the  pri-
mary  benefit  of  using  dedicated  trains  to  be  the  significant  costs  savings  over  the 
lifetime of the Yucca Mountain Program. However, there may also be circumstances 
where  general  freight  service  would  be  more  appropriate  to  promote  costs  savings, 
operational flexibility and/or efficiency for shipments to the Yucca Mountain reposi-
tory. 

Question 4. The National Academy of Sciences, the Government Accountability Of-
fice  and  even  the  state  of  Nevada  have  recommended  that  the  oldest  spent  nuclear 
fuel  should  be  shipped  first.  They  claim  that  storing  nuclear  waste  at  the  reactor 
for 50 years or more before shipping it can reduce public health risks from radiation 
by up to 85 percent. The Academy also notes that this will reduce the consequences 
of  a  terrorist  attack.  So  why  hasn’t  the  DOE  considered  shipping  older  fuel  first  in 
its environmental impact statements (EIS)? 

Answer.  In  developing  the  impact  analyses  in  its  environmental  impact  state-
ments. DOE used conservative, ‘‘bounding’’ assumptions. This is a standard risk as-
sessment  practice  to  ensure  the  actual  impacts  likely  to  occur  will  be  less  than— 
in some cases, much less than—the calculated estimate of impacts. The age and ra-
dioactivity level of the fuel is one example. In DOE’s analyses, the Department has 
assumed  that  every  shipment  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  would  have  the  very  highest 
level  of  radioactivity  permissible  by  Federal  regulation,  every  single  time,  which  in 
reality  is  not  possible  (older  fuel  already  exists).  DOE’s  analysis  showed  that,  even 
if every shipment had the very highest levels permissible, the shipments would still 
pose  a  very  low  risk.  The  fuel  in  any  particular  shipment,  regardless  of  age,  does 
not present a safety or security issue so long as the material is packaged and trans-
ported in accordance with the strict regulations that apply to such shipments. 

Question  5.  In  May,  Holtec  International—a  firm  that  submitted  a  bid  to  design 
the transportation canisters for the DOE—said that an earthquake at Yucca Moun-
tain would send the casks into a ‘‘chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts’’ 
if it were to rely on the DOE’s specifications. The firm said that ‘‘pigs will fly before 
the  cask  will  stay  put.’’  Has  the  DOE  taken  any  steps  to  respond  to  Holtec’s  con-
cerns? 

Answer. In June 2008, DOE submitted its license application for authorization to 
construct the repository, and in September 2008, NRC docketed and commenced its 
detailed  review  of  the  application.  The  NRC  will  conduct  a  thorough  and  rigorous 
review,  pursuant  to  NRC’s  applicable  regulations,  of  DOE’s  license  application  and 
will  determine  the  adequacy  and  safety  of  the  repository.  The  NRC  will  similarly 
conduct  a  rigorous  and  thorough  review  of  the  applications  that  will  be  submitted 
for  certificates  of  compliance  for  the  casks  used  to  transport  and  age  spent  nuclear 
fuel onsite. 

Question 6. Why hasn’t the DOE requested an independent assessment of nuclear 
waste  transportation  security,  as  was  recommended  by  the  National  Academy  of 
Sciences in their 2006 report? 

Answer.  DOE  agrees  with  NRC’s  position  that  security  measures  for  future  ship-
ments must defend against the threat that exists at the time of that shipment, and 
take  advantage  of  enhancements  in  technology  then  available.  Since  these  factors 
may change over time and shipments to the Yucca Mountain repository are not ex-
pected  to  begin  until  2020  at  the  earliest,  it  would  be  more  appropriate  to  conduct 
an  independent  security  assessment  closer  to  the  time  of  actual  shipments.  DOE, 
nevertheless, is currently a participant in a Multilateral Agreement with Great Brit-
ain,  France  and  Germany  to  conduct  classified  laboratory  tests  that  would  accu-
rately measure the impacts of sabotage events on spent fuel. These tests will inform 
future security assessments. 

Question  7.  Has  the  DOE  made  public  its  plan  for  selecting  national  rail  and 

truck routes, as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences? 

Answer.  DOE  has  addressed  routing  in  its  National  Environmental  Policy  Act 
(NEPA) documentation relating to transportation, both nationally and in Nevada, of 
spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain. Truck ship-
ments  will  be  shipped  in  accordance  with  DOT  regulations,  using  preferred  routes 
that  reduce  time  in  transit.  A  preferred  route  is  an  Interstate  system  highway  se-
lected by a State or Tribal routing agency in accordance with applicable DOT regu-
lations. Under those regulations, substantive consultation with affected jurisdictions

95 

would  be  required  prior  to  designating  an  alternative  route  to  ensure  consideration 
of all impacts and continuity of designated route. 

Rail shipments would be shipped using routes selected by the rail carriers, which 
have responsibility for selection of rail routes. Railroads are privately owned and op-
erated, and shippers and rail carriers determine routes based on a variety of factors. 
Route selection for shipments to Yucca Mountain would involve discussions between 
DOE  and  the  chosen  rail  carriers,  with  consideration  of  input  from  other  stake-
holders.  While  Federal  rules  do  not  prescribe  specific  routes  for  spent  nuclear  fuel 
and  high-level  radioactive  waste  shipments  by  rail,  certain  factors  must  be  consid-
ered in route selection. 

DOE anticipates that it will identify a preliminary suite of national routes 5 years 
prior to shipments in order to identify states and tribes that will be eligible for tech-
nical  assistance  and  funds  for  training  under  Section  180(c)  of  the  Nuclear  Waste 
Policy  Act.  Over  the  past  several  years,  the  DOE  has  engaged  in  discussions  with 
rail carriers and other stakeholders on issues related to routing. 

Question  8.  Has  the  DOE  established  a  social  risk  advisory  group,  as  rec-

ommended by the National Academy of Sciences? 

Answer.  As  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  recommended,  DOE  has  engaged 
stakeholders  on  methods  to  communicate  about  transportation  safety,  and  is  cur-
rently exploring the formation of an advisory group chartered under the Federal Ad-
visory Committee Act to provide input on a range of transportation issues, including 
the public perception of risk. 

Question  9.  What  is  the  DOE’s  contingency  plan  for  transporting  waste  to  Yucca 
Mountain  in  the  event  that  rail  access  to  Yucca  is  not  available  by  the  time  Yucca 
is opened? Was this considered in the DOE’s Rail Alignment EIS? 

Answer. In order to operate efficiently and meet its obligations under the Nuclear 
Waste  Policy  Act,  DOE  needs  to  have  direct  rail  access  to  the  Yucca  Mountain  re-
pository.  The  facility  will  be  able  to  accept  truck  shipments  of  spent  nuclear  fuel, 
but  rail  access  will  be  required  to  efficiently  ship  larger  transportation,  aging  and 
disposal  (TAD)  canisters  that  are  the  basis  of  the  repository  design.  DOE  plans  for 
the railroad to be available before commencement of shipments of spent nuclear fuel 
and  high-level  radioactive  waste.  If  the  railroad  were  not  initially  available,  how-
ever, DOE anticipates that it would consider shipments of spent fuel in small truck 
casks  that  are  included  in  the  scenarios  analyzed  in  the  Department’s  NEPA  docu-
mentation relating to the Yucca Mountain repository. 

Question  10.  Out  of  72  commercial  sites  with  nuclear  waste,  24  of  them  do  not 
have  railroad  access.  That  means  the  DOE  will  have  to  haul  waste  by  truck  from 
at least one third of nuclear reactors. Does the DOE plan to truck the waste to the 
railroad?  Has  the  DOT  approved  this  approach,  given  that  they  are  highly  con-
cerned about unnecessary stops during transport? 

Answer.  Sites  without  direct  rail  access  will  be  serviced  by  heavy-haul  trucks  to 
transport  rail  casks  to  a  nearby  railhead.  If  a  site  were  unable  to  accommodate  a 
rail  cask.  a  smaller,  truck  cask  would  be  used  on  standard  size  semi-truck  trailers. 
Intermodal  transfers  are  common  in  the  transportation  industry,  and  the  logistical 
challenges  are  well-understood.  At  this  time,  more  than  10  years  before  shipments, 
potential site-specific transportation infrastructure issues cannot be known with any 
degree  of  certainty.  DOE  also  evaluated  the  use  of  barge  transportation  for  trans-
porting  rail  casks  to  nearby  railheads  from  generator  sites  near  navigable  water-
ways but not served by railheads. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

MICHAEL WEBER 

Question.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  has  recommended  an  independent 
examination  of  the  security  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  and  high-level  radioactive  waste 
transportation prior to the commencement of large-quantity shipments to an interim 
or  final  repository.  Has  the  NRC  had  difficulties  working  with  the  DOE  to  request 
this  type  of  examination?  Why  hasn’t  the  NRC  requested  an  independent  assess-
ment of nuclear waste transportation security? What is the NRC currently doing to 
expand the knowledge base for the secure transportation of nuclear waste? 

Answer.  The  DOE,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  and  NRC  have 
a  long  history  of  working  together  cooperatively  on  transportation  safety  and  secu-
rity  issues,  including  their  joint  sponsorship  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences’ 
(NAS) recent study on the transportation of spent fuel. The principal finding of the 
NAS study was: 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

96 

The  Committee  could  identify  no  fundamental  technical  barriers  to  the  safe 
transport  of  SNF  and  HLW  in  the  United  States.  Transport  by  highway  (for 
small-quantity  shipments),  and  by  rail  (for  large-quantity  shipments)  is,  from 
a  technical  viewpoint,  a  low-radiological-risk  activity,  with  manageable  safety, 
health, and environmental consequences, when conducted with strict adherence 
to existing regulations. 

The  NRC  takes  this  study’s  recommendations  very  seriously  and  addressed  them 
in  our  program,  including  preparations  for  full-scale  testing  in  the  U.S.  and  addi-
tional  analyses  of  long-duration,  fully  engulfing  fires.  The  NAS  study  also  rec-
ommended that, ‘‘. . . an independent examination of the security of spent fuel and 
high-level waste transportation should be carried out prior to the commencement of 
large-quantity shipments to a Federal repository or to interim storage.’’ At present, 
the  NRC  is  not  planning  to  conduct  an  independent  security  assessment  with  DOE 
that would cover both shipments to Yucca Mountain and to an interim storage facil-
ity  because  NRC  security  assessments  have  shown  that  current  security  measures 
and  standards  put  in  place  since  September  11,  2001,  are  adequate  for  the  protec-
tion of spent fuel and high level waste transportation even in the event of increased 
shipping campaigns. Specifically, in light of the elevated threat that the U.S. experi-
enced  following  the  terrorist  attacks  on  September  11,  the  NRC  issued  safeguards 
advisories  and  orders  to  enhance  transportation  security  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  and 
other  large  quantities  of  radioactive  material.  The  NRC  issued  these  security  en-
hancements in coordination with DOT, the Department of Homeland Security, State 
agencies,  and  other  Federal  agencies.  The  NRC  security  assessments  of  transpor-
tation,  which  were  completed  after  the  publication  of  the  NAS  report,  evaluated  a 
number  of  representative  transportation  package  designs  against  a  variety  of  cred-
ible  land-based  threats  and  a  deliberate  plane  crash.  The  results  of  these  security 
assessments,  which  we  have  shared  with  DOT,  DOE,  and  other  organizations  that 
have  a  ‘‘need  to  know,’’  demonstrate  that  the  current  requirements,  combined  with 
the  security  enhancements  put  in  place  after  September  11,  provide  adequate  pro-
tection  of  public  health  and  safety,  and  the  environment,  and  common  defense  and 
security.  These  safeguards  advisories  and  orders  are  only  an  interim  solution  and 
will not be relied on indefinitely. In late 2009, the NRC intends to issue a proposed 
rule  for  public  comment  that  would  revise  the  requirements  for  secure  transport  of 
spent  nuclear  fuel;  the  proposed  rule  would  include  additional  measures  to  address 
the current threat environment. 

Physical protection measures for future shipments must match the threat in place 
at the time of shipment. In addition, shipment tracking and monitoring technologies 
are constantly improving. The NRC would be responsible for overseeing the security 
requirements  for  commercial  shipments  to  an  interim  storage  facility  and  DOE 
would be responsible for implementing and overseeing the security requirements for 
Yucca  Mountain  shipments.  Shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain  would  not  begin,  at  the 
earliest,  until  2020,  based  on  current  DOE  estimates.  This  estimate  is  tentative, 
given  that  NRC  staff  continue  to  review  the  DOE  license  application  to  construct 
and  operate  the  repository.  Therefore,  it  would  be  more  appropriate  to  consider 
whether  an  independent  examination  of  shipment  security  is  needed  closer  to  the 
time  of  actual  shipments.  To  expand  the  knowledge  base  for  the  secure  transpor-
tation  of  nuclear  waste,  the  NRC  has  recently  completed,  through  contract  with 
Sandia  National  Laboratories,  a  number  of  security  assessments  on  representative 
spent  fuel  transportation  package  designs.  The  NRC  believes  that  these  spent  fuel 
transportation  package  assessments  demonstrate  that  the  stringent  safety  stand-
ards applied to the design of spent fuel packages provide substantial protection from 
security  threats.  NRC  is  considering  the  merits  of  releasing  non-sensitive  sum-
maries of current spent fuel transportation package security assessments in partial 
response to the NAS study recommendation. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BARBARA BOXER TO 

MICHAEL WEBER 

Question  1.  If  the  Department  of  Energy  is  responsible  for  shipments  of  waste  to 

Yucca Mountain, what will be the role the Nuclear Regulatory Commission? 

Answer.  Because  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  plans  to  take  custody  of  the 
spent  fuel  at  the  licensee’s  site  (i.e.,  at  a  nuclear  power  plant),  the  NRC’s  role  in 
the  transportation  of  spent  fuel  to  a  repository  would  be  limited  to  certification  of 
the  designs  for  shipping  casks  used  for  transport  and,  in  the  event  of  a  transpor-
tation incident, providing technical expertise, if requested. Section 180(a) of the Nu-
clear  Waste  Policy  Act  of  1982  prohibits  the  Secretary  of  Energy  from  transporting 
spent nuclear fuel or high level waste to a repository or monitored retrievable stor-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

97 

age facility except in packages certified for such purpose by the NRC. Physical secu-
rity  and  transportation  safety  for  these  shipments  would  be  addressed  under  DOE 
and the Department of Transportation’s requirements. 

Question  2.  Is  the  NRC  planning  to  do  an  independent  security  assessment  with 
DOE that would cover both shipments to Yucca Mountain and to an interim storage 
facility? 

Answer. At the current time, NRC is not planning to conduct an independent se-
curity  assessment  with  DOE  that  would  cover  both  shipments  to  Yucca  Mountain 
and  to  an  interim  storage  facility.  Current  security  measures  and  standards  put  in 
place  since  September  11,  2001,  are  adequate  for  the  protection  of  spent  fuel  and 
high-level  waste  transportation  even  in  the  event  of  increased  shipping  campaigns. 
Physical  protection  measures  for  future  shipments  must  match  the  threat  in  place 
at the time of shipment. In addition, shipment tracking and monitoring technologies 
are constantly improving. Shipments to Yucca Mountain could not begin, at the ear-
liest,  until  2020,  based  on  current  DOE  estimates.  This  estimate  is  tentative  given 
that NRC staff continue to review the DOE license application to construct and op-
erate  the  repository.  Therefore,  it  would  be  more  appropriate  to  consider  whether 
an independent examination of shipment security is needed closer to the time of ac-
tual shipments. 

Question  3.  Please  explain  the  NRC’s  physical  protection  requirements  for  the 
transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  as  they  would  relate  to  the  transport  of  spent 
nuclear  fuel  to  Yucca  Mountain.  What  is  the  process  for  advance  notification  of 
State Governors prior to a shipment? 

Answer.  As  DOE  plans  to  take  custody  of  the  spent  fuel  at  the  NRC  licensee’s 
site, DOE requirements would control the physical security of spent fuel shipments. 
NRC’s physical protection requirements would not apply. 

However,  Section180(b)  of  the  Nuclear  Waste  Policy  Act  requires  that  the  Sec-
retary of Energy abide by the Commission’s regulations regarding advanced notifica-
tion  of  State  and  local  governments  prior  to  transportation  of  spent  fuel  or  high- 
level  waste  to  Yucca  Mountain.  NRC’s  advanced  notification  requirements  in  10 
CFR 73.37(f) require an NRC licensee to notify the Governor or Governor’s designee 
at  least  4  days  prior  to  a  spent  fuel  shipment  within  or  through  a  state.  Notifica-
tions delivered by mail must be postmarked at least 7 days prior to shipment. 

Question 4. You mention in your testimony that you are examining the MacArthur 
Maze  accident  in  Oakland  and  the  I–5/14  interchange  tunnel  fire  in  Northern  Los 
Angeles  County  as  part  of  your  efforts  to  improve  the  security  of  commercial  ship-
ments of spent nuclear fuel. Will you share a copy of the results when your studies 
are completed? 

Answer.  Yes.  The  MacArthur  Maze  accident  and  1–5/14  interchange  tunnel  fire 
studies  are  focused  on  how  spent  fuel  casks  would  perform  under  real  world  acci-
dent conditions involving severe fires. The studies are not specifically focused on se-
curity-related  scenarios,  although  the  studies  could  be  used  to  inform  the  assess-
ment  of  sabotage  or  security  scenarios  involving  severe  fires.  NRC  is  planning  to 
publish  the  draft  reports  for  the  MacArthur  Maze  accident  in  Oakland  and  the  1– 
5/14  interchange  tunnel  fire  in  Northern  Los  Angeles  County  for  public  comment. 
We anticipate that the draft reports on both accidents will be published in mid-cal-
endar  year  2009.  The  NRC’s  Office  of  Congressional  Affairs  will  provide  your  office 
a  copy  of  the  draft  reports  as  soon  as  they  are  published.  The  NRC  will  also  notify 
the public of the reports’ availability and seek public comments by Federal Register 
notice  and  by  making  the  reports  available  on  the  NRC’s  public  website.  The  final 
reports  will  be  issued  after  public  comments  are  considered.  The  NRC’s  Office  of 
Congressional Affairs will provide your office a copy of the final reports

MICHAEL WEBER 

Question 1. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recorded at least 
four accidents involving spent nuclear fuel shipments over the past 30 years. Please 
tell the Committee about those accidents and how the NRC responded. 

Answer.  The  NRC  is  aware  of  four  transportation  accidents  since  1971  that  have 
involved  loaded  spent  fuel  casks  in  transit.  These  accidents  are  summarized  in  the 
table  below.  When  accidents  involving  spent  fuel  shipments  occur,  State  and  local 
governments  have  the  primary  responsibility  to  respond.  Therefore,  these  accidents 
were  handled  at  the  State  and  local  level,  with  assistance  from  the  carriers  and 
shippers.

Question  2.  While  the  risk  for  a  major  accident  involving  a  nuclear  waste  ship-
ment is not great, it still exists and one major accident after thousands of successful 
shipments  would  mean  this  entire  program  is  a  failure.  How  is  the  NRC  prepared 
to  respond  to  a  worst-case  scenario  situation,  in  which  there  is  a  major  radioactive 
release on a railway or a highway? 

Answer.  The  likelihood  of  highway  or  rail  accident  occurring  that  results  in  a 
major release of radioactive material is extremely low. This assessment is based on 
the  outstanding  safety  record  of  spent  fuel  shipments  during  the  past  thirty  years, 
numerous  transportation  shipment  risk  assessments  completed  by  both  the  NRC 
and other Federal Agencies, an independent assessment of spent fuel transportation 
safety  published  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  in  2006,  and  the  technical 
knowledge  gained  from  the  actual  physical  testing  of  spent  fuel  casks  conducted 
both within the United States and abroad. 

In  the  event  that  an  accident  involving  a  spent  fuel  shipment  occurs,  State  and 
local governments have the primary responsibility to respond. The NRC is prepared 
to  respond  by  providing  technical  expertise  if  requested,  to  support  State  and  local 
governments in their response. In an extremely unlikely accident scenario involving 
a major release of radioactive material on a railway or a highway, NRC would sup-
port a coordinated Federal response under the Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex 
of the National Response Framework. 

In  accordance  with  the  Nuclear/Radiological  Incident  Annex,  the  Federal  Depart-
ment  or  Agency  responsible  for  the  material  involved  in  the  accident  would  coordi-
nate the response of other Federal Departments and Agencies, including the deploy-
ment  of  specialized  equipment  and  personnel.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  is 
the  coordinating  agency  for  transportation  incidents  involving  DOE  materials. 
Therefore, if DOE takes custody of spent fuel prior to shipment to Yucca Mountain, 
DOE  would  be  the  coordinating  agency  for  transportation  incidents.  In  this  case, 
NRC  is  prepared  to  provide  technical  expertise.  For  shipments  to  sites  other  than 
Yucca  Mountain,  the  NRC  is  prepared  to  act  as  the  coordinating  agency  for  trans-
portation  incidents  that  involve  the  shipment  of  radiological  material  by  NRC  or 
Agreement State licensees. 

The  NRC  is  also  prepared  to  support  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  in 
those  circumstances  under  which  they  take  a  lead  role  in  coordinating  the  Federal 
response under the National Response Framework. 

Question  3.  The  NRC  reports  prepared  in  the  late  1970s  estimated  that  sabotage 
of  a  spent  fuel  shipment  in  an  urban  area  could  cause  hundreds  of  early  fatalities, 
thousands of latent cancer fatalities and economic losses in the billions. In 1979, the 
NRC promulgated regulations to safeguard shipments from sabotage and terrorism. 
Has  the  NRC  reconsidered  these  regulations  or  made  any  significant  changes  to 
them over the past 30 years? 

Answer.  Yes,  the  NRC  continually  evaluates  its  regulations  based  on  new  infor-

With regard to the reports, the NRC published two reports in the mid-1970s: Cal-
culations  of  Radiological  Consequences  from  Sabotage  of  Shipping  Casks  for  Spent 
Fuel  and  High  Level  Waste,  NUREG–0194,  February  1977,  and  Final  Environ-
mental  Statement  on  Transportation  of  Radioactive  Material  by  Air  and  Other 
Modes,  NUREG–0170,  December  1977,  that  estimated  the  health  effects  of  a  radio-
logical  release  in  a  non-urban  area  and  determined  that  the  estimated  risks  were 
not  considered  substantive  enough  to  warrant  regulatory  action.  Sandia  Labora-
tories  also  issued  a  study  in  1977,  Transport  of  Radionuclides  in  Urban  Environs: 

mation.

99 

A Working Draft Assessment, SAND 77–1927, suggesting that the sabotage of spent 
fuel  shipments  had  the  potential  for  producing  serious  radiologic  consequences  in 
areas  of  high  population  density.  In  response  to  the  Sandia  study,  the  NRC  issued 
interim  safeguard  measures  for  spent  fuel  shipments  in  an  interim  rule  published 
on June 15, 1979. The physical protection requirements were subsequently modified 
based on public comments in a final rule dated June 3, 1980. 

The  Sandia  report  (SAND  77–1927)  contained  estimates  which  were  subject  to 
large uncertainties due to lack of technical data. As a result, NRC and the Depart-
ment  of  Energy  sponsored  research  programs  to  yield  information  about  the  poten-
tial for radiological releases from sabotage events. The research supported a conclu-
sion  that  the  potential  releases  from  sabotage  events  were  a  tiny  percentage  of  the 
values estimated in the Sandia report (e.g., no early fatalities and seven latent can-
cer  fatalities).  The  interim  safeguard  measures  were  subsequently  modified  to  re-
flect  the  research  results  and  the  modified  measures  were  incorporated  into  NRC 
regulations by public rulemaking on June 8, 1984. 

After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the NRC determined that additional se-
curity measures were necessary during the transport of spent nuclear fuel and that 
the  existing  regulations  should  be  enhanced  to  further  protect  spent  fuel  during 
transport.  The  NRC  began  issuing  orders  to  licensees  shipping  spent  nuclear  fuel 
in  October  2002.  Only  those  licensees  currently  shipping  or  expecting  to  ship  spent 
fuel  in  the  near  future  received  the  initial  order.  Since  2002,  the  staff  issued  addi-
tional  orders  to  licensees  transporting  spent  fuel  when  these  licensees  indicated 
their  intention  to  ship,  The  orders  imposing  additional  security  measures  during 
shipments of spent nuclear fuel are an interim solution, pending rulemaking, as de-
scribed below. 

The NRC initiated a rulemaking in September 2008 to enhance the in-transit se-
curity  requirements  of  10  CFR  Part  73  consistent  with  the  security  measures  im-
posed by the post-9/11 orders. These measures include: assuring consistent physical 
protection  along  the  entire  shipping  route;  pre-planning  and  coordination  of  a  ship-
ment with the states; communications among the transporters, escorts, local law en-
forcement  agencies,  and  movement  control  centers;  trustworthiness  and  reliability 
of individuals associated with the shipment; and normal and contingency procedures 
and  training  of  individuals  associated  with  the  shipment,  The  proposed  rule  is  ex-
pected to be published in late 2009 for public comment, with the final rule expected 
to be issued in late 2010-early 2011. 

Question  4.  Since  the  attacks  against  America  on  September  11,  2001,  the  NRC 
has  studied  the  vulnerability  of  nuclear  waste  transportation  containers.  Why 
haven’t the results of these studies been made available to the applicable state and 
local  governments?  If  states  and  local  governments  are  going  to  be  involved  in  the 
transportation  planning  process,  shouldn’t  they  have  more  information  about  the 
risks  involved?  What  can  be  done  to  involve  state  and  local  governments  in  the 
transportation planning process? 

Answer.  The  Commission  understands  the  importance  of  this  information  in  ena-
bling  State  and  local  governments  to  plan  for  the  safety  and  security  of  spent  fuel 
shipments, especially in their emergency response roles and responsibilities, and in-
tends to ensure that they have the information they need to exercise these roles and 
responsibilities.  In  late  2006,  the  NRC  began  a  dialogue  with  representatives  of 
State  Regional  Transportation  Groups  aimed  at  sharing  information  from  the  NRC 
spent fuel transportation package security assessments with State and local govern-
ments  to  help  them  prepare  more  effectively  for  their  emergency  response  and  law 
enforcement responsibilities. This ongoing dialogue includes a discussion of what in-
formation (related to the spent fuel transportation package security assessments) is 
needed,  how  and  by  whom  such  information  would  be  used,  and  how  shared  sen-
sitive  information  would  be  protected.  These  groups  include  transportation  safety 
task  forces  established  through  the  Western  States  Energy  Board,  the  Southern 
States  Energy  Board,  and  the  Council  of  State  Governments,  Midwestern  and 
Northeast States Divisions. Collectively, the state regional groups contain state rep-
resentatives from all of the states that have potential transportation routes to Yucca 
Mountain. 

Question  5.  In  2001,  11  train  cars  derailed  while  passing  through  the  Howard 
Street Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland, setting off a fire that lasted for days and was 
1800 degrees Fahrenheit. Could the Department of Energy’s (DOE) proposed multi- 
use transportation casks withstand such an accident? 

Answer.  The  NRC  staff  has  extensively  evaluated  the  Baltimore  Tunnel  fire  of 
2001,  along  with  other  severe  accidents  as  part  of  its  efforts  to  ensure  the  safety 
of  radioactive  material  transportation.  In  November  2006,  NRC  released  a  study 
that  focused  on  how  three  representative  spent  fuel  cask  designs  would  have  per-

formed  if  they  were  involved  in  the  Baltimore  Tunnel  fire  (Spent  Fuel  Transpor-
tation  Package  Response  to  the  Baltimore  Tunnel  Fire  Scenario,  NUREG/CR6886, 
Rev.1.,  November  2006).  The  cask  designs  analyzed  included  the  NAC–LWT  truck 
cask,  and  the  HOLTEC  HI–STAR  100  and  TN–68  rail  casks.  The  study  concluded 
that  the  fire,  if  it  had  involved  spent  fuel  casks,  would  not  have  caused  a  release 
of radioactive material from the spent fuel for any of these three cask designs. 

The  Baltimore  Tunnel  fire  study  did  not  specifically  consider  DOE’s  proposed 
multi-use  transportation  casks,  as  the  designs  for  these  casks  are  still  being  final-
ized  and  have  not  yet  been  submitted  to  the  NRC  for  review.  Therefore,  it  would 
be  premature  to  make  a  definitive  judgment  as  to  how  DOE’s  proposed  multi-use 
transportation  cask  designs  would  perform.  However,  we  believe  that  DOE’s  pro-
posed  multi-use  transportation  rail  cask  designs  would  be  similar  in  size,  weight, 
and  configuration  to  the  rail  casks  we  analyzed  in  our  2006  Baltimore  Tunnel  fire 
study. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

EDWARD PRITCHARD 

Question. The DOE is advocating for legislation that would give the DOE author-
ity to preempt the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) regulation of the transpor-
tation of nuclear waste. Is this something you support? Do you think it is necessary 
to  preempt  DOT  regulations  to  facilitate  a  massive  nuclear  waste  shipping  cam-
paign? How would that affect the safety of such shipments? 

Answer.  SNF/HLRW  has  been  successfully  shipped  by  rail  for  the  past  50  years. 
The  exemplary  safety  record  associated  with  these  shipments  over  this  time-frame 
leads FRA to firmly believe that SNF/HLRW can be safely and securely transported 
by  rail  from  its  current  locations  throughout  the  country  to  Yucca  Mountain.  FRA 
strongly  believes,  however,  that  the  cornerstone  of  this  exemplary  safety  record  is 
application  of  the  comprehensive  regulatory  framework  and  effective  oversight  by 
DOT  and  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  and  that  the  true  strength  of  the 
transportation  safety  program  lies  in  the  shared  responsibility  and  cooperation 
among  Federal,  State,  and  local  partners.  Although  in  the  Nuclear  Fuel  Manage-
ment  and  Disposal  Act  submitted  to  Congress  in  2006  DOE  proposed  to  preempt 
DOT’s  regulation  of  the  transportation  of  radioactive  materials  in  certain  cir-
cumstances, FRA understands that DOE is not currently advocating for such legisla-
tion.  Given  the  success  of  the  current  Federal  regulatory  system  governing  the 
transport of SNF/HLRW and the safety-critical aspects of such transportation, FRA 
would not support preemption of the comprehensive Federal regulatory process cur-
rently governing the transport of SNF/HLRW. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. HARRY REID TO 

EDWARD PRITCHARD 

Question  1.  In  comments  to  the  Surface  Transportation  Board,  CSX  recently  ex-
pressed  concern  that  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  is  retreating  from  its  com-
mitment to use dedicated train service for shipping nuclear waste. The DOE appar-
ently hasn’t decided whether it will share its trains or its Nevada rail line with com-
mercial  carriers.  Does  the  Federal  Railroad  Administration  take  a  position  about 
whether  nuclear  waste  should  be  transported  in  dedicated  train  service?  What  are 
the risks of putting nuclear waste on the same trains as commercial freight? 

Answer. In response to Congress’s mandate in the Hazardous Materials Transpor-
tation Uniform Safety Act of 1990, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) stud-
ied  the  safety  of  using  dedicated  trains  for  the  transportation  of  spent  nuclear  fuel 
(SNF)  and  high  level  radioactive  waste  (HLRW)  as  compared  to  other  methods  of 
rail  transportation  (i.e.,  general  consist  trains  transporting  benign  freight  and/or 
other hazardous materials or ‘‘key trains’’ operating at maximum authorized speeds 
of  50  mph).  A  dedicated  train  is  a  train  that  consists  only  of  equipment  and  lading 
associated  with  the  transportation  of  SNF/HLRW.  FRA’s  research  concluded  that 
given the comprehensive regulatory scheme applicable to the transportation of SNF 
and  HLRW,  the  risk  to  employees  and  the  public  from  such  transportation  is  low 
to  begin  with,  but  on  a  comparative  basis,  use  of  dedicated  trains  would  offer  sev-
eral  advantages  over  general  consist  trains  in  the  rail  operating  environment.  For 
example,  because  by  definition  dedicated  trains  will  be  routed  more  directly  to  a 
destination,  the  trains  will  have  shorter  transit  times  than  general  consist  trains. 
This  shorter  transit  time  reduces  the  probability  of  an  SNF/HLRW  cask  being  in-
volved in a train accident and the potential hazards that can be associated with fre-
quent  yard  stops  (e.g.,  increased  dwell  time  and  increased  handling  and  switching 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

101 

of  the  cars  carrying  the  casks).  The  probability  of  a  dedicated  train  being  involved 
in  an  accident  is  further  reduced  by  the  decreased  stopping  distance  of  the  shorter 
consist,  as  compared  to  general  consist  trains.  In  addition,  use  of  dedicated  trains 
would  reduce  the  potential  radiation  exposure  in  any  accident,  as  accident  clearing 
can be expedited since the consist would be shorter than a general consist train, and 
since  there  are  no  other  hazardous  materials  in  the  consist,  there  would  be  little 
chance of a fire that would prolong the response and accident clearing duration. Use 
of  dedicated  trains  would  also  allow  more  flexibility  to  avoid  higher-risk  locations 
and to more easily impose operating restrictions such as lower operating speeds, as 
well  as  making  it  possible  to  further  enhance  the  security  of  shipments  of  SNF/ 
HLRW. 

The risks of transporting SNF/HLRW in a general consist train are directly oppo-
site  to  the  advantages  cited  above.  For  example,  a  general  consist  train  will  gen-
erally be longer than a dedicated train and will not be routed to its end destination 
as directly and expeditiously as a dedicated train. Accordingly, the stopping distance 
of a general consist train will generally be longer than a dedicated train, the transit 
times will be increased, and a rail car transporting a cask in a general consist train 
will  be  more  likely  to  be  subject  to  additional  handling  and  dwell  time  in  railroad 
yards.  If  other  hazardous  materials  are  present  in  the  train  consist,  there  is  an  in-
creased  risk  that  in  the  event  of  an  accident  or  incident  that  results  in  the  breach 
of  a  hazardous  materials  packaging  in  the  train  (e.g.,  a  tank  car  containing  a  haz-
ardous  material),  that  other  hazardous  material  could  interact  with  or  have  an  im-
pact on the SNF/HLRW. 

Given  the  clear  advantages  of  utilizing  dedicated  trains  as  compared  to  general 
consist trains to transport SNF/HLRW by rail, FRA is currently conducting research 
to identify the train dynamics applicable to the configuration of dedicated train con-
sists, as well as whether any additional specialized operational or mechanical meas-
ures  should  be  implemented  to  ensure  the  safety  of  such  operations.  Based  on  the 
results  of  this  research,  FRA  plans  to  initiate  a  rulemaking  proceeding  amending 
the Federal railroad safety regulations as necessary. 

In a March 2005 report to Congress titled ‘‘Use of Dedicated Trains for Transpor-
tation of High-Level Radioactive Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel,’’ FRA examined in 
further  detail  the  relative  safety  of  rail  shipment  alternatives  for  the  transport  of 
SNF and HLRW. A copy of that report can be accessed at: http://www.fra.dot.gov/ 
downloads/safety/reportldedicatedltrains.pdf. 

Question  2.  The  DOE  is  not  in  the  railroad  business  today.  Do  you  believe  that 
the  DOE  is  prepared  to  not  only  build  and  operate  the  largest  new  rail  line  since 
the  1930s,  but  to  launch  a  nationwide  campaign  to  make  thousands  of  shipments 
of nuclear waste? 

Answer.  Over  the  past  16  years,  FRA  has  actively  coordinated  with  the  relevant 
offices  of  DOE  on  the  infrastructure  and  planning  issues  that  will  need  to  be  ad-
dressed  to  ensure  the  safe  rail  transportation  of  SNF/HLRW  to  Yucca  Mountain. 
Most recently, DOE’s Office of Logistics Management requested FRA’s assistance in 
planning  the  proposed  Nevada  rail  line.  FRA  has  and  will  continue  to  work  with 
that office, and other relevant DOE offices, to provide the necessary railroad-specific 
expertise  and  assistance  to  ensure  that  transportation  of  SNF/HLRW  to  Yucca 
Mountain  will  occur  safely  and  securely.  In  addition,  because  as  currently  con-
templated,  SNF/HLRW  will  be  transported  to  Yucca  Mountain  by  commercial  rail 
lines  under  contract  to  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  these  operations  will  be 
required  to  comply  with  the  DOT’s  comprehensive  set  of  hazardous  materials  and 
rail  safety  regulations  (49  CFR  Parts  107,  171–180  and  49  CFR  Parts  209–244). 
FRA will continue working with the DOE, all interested stakeholders, and when ap-
propriate,  the  carriers  responsible  for  transportation  of  the  SNF/HLRW  to  Yucca 
Mountain  to  ensure  that  such  transportation  is  conducted  in  the  safest  and  most 
secure manner possible and in compliance with all applicable regulations. 

Spent  nuclear  fuel  shipments  are  a  very  minor  portion  of  hazardous  cargo  move-
ments  by  the  rail  industry.  In  2006,  all  radioactive  contents  shipped  by  rail  were 
only  0.5  percent  of  the  overall  hazardous  material  transported  (AAR  data).  Spent 
nuclear fuel is a minor subset of the radioactive cargo. In this context, the challenge 
presented by these shipments is manageable.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. HARRY REID TO 

TED WILLKE 

Question  1.  How  prepared  are  states  today  to  deal  with  thousands  of  rail  and 
truck  shipments  of  nuclear  waste?  What  additional  steps  must  be  taken  to  make 
emergency  responders  prepared  to  deal  with  a  potential  accident  involving  a  radio-
active release? 

Answer.  PHMSA  recognizes  the  challenges  the  emergency  response  community 
faces  in  dealing  with  transport  accidents  involving  spent  nuclear  fuel.  In  fact,  one 
of  our  core  goals  is  reaching  out  to  emergency  responders  and  hazardous  materials 
stakeholders to ensure the preparedness and response communities are fully primed 
to deal with any type of hazardous material incident. PHMSA is prepared to provide 
its  technical  expertise  to  its  Federal  partners,  the  nuclear  industry  and  State  and 
local governments to ensure the transportation system remains safe. 

While  successful  hazardous  materials  emergency  preparedness  programs  exist, 
Congress has recognized additional effort will be needed when spent nuclear fuel is 
transported  to  a  geologic  repository.  Accordingly,  Section  180(c)  of  the  Nuclear 
Waste  Policy  Act  directs  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  to  provide  technical  and 
financial assistance to states and Indian tribes for training public safety officials in 
procedures  for  safe,  routine  transportation  and  emergency  response  situations.  As 
transportation  planning  progresses,  PHMSA  will  be  prepared  to  work  with  DOE  to 
apply  its  experience  with  existing  emergency  preparedness  programs  in  developing 
a Yucca Mountain preparedness program. PHMSA also encourages DOE to conduct 
exercise  programs  to  test  and  validate  State,  Tribal,  and  local  officials’  transpor-
tation emergency response plans. 

Question  2.  Given  that  Nevada  will  undergo  shipments  of  nuclear  waste  from  43 
other states if the Yucca Mountain project moves forward, why has Nevada received 
less Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness grant funding than all except for 
9 states? 

Answer.  Hazardous  Materials  Emergency  Preparedness  (HMEP)  planning  and 
training  grant  funds  are  apportioned  by  formula.  The  grant  allocation  formula  was 
developed  by  an  interagency  workgroup  (which  is  now  the  National  Response 
Team’s training subcommittee) to distribute HMEP grants funds fairly and consist-
ently  to  states,  territories,  and  Indian  tribes  for  addressing  all  hazardous  material 
shipments.  Spent  nuclear  fuel  shipments  are  as  very  minor  portion  of  the  overall 
hazardous  material  shipment  workload.  To  ensure  a  sufficient  minimum  level  of 
planning  funds  for  all  grantees,  a  base  amount  is  divided  equally  among  all  states 
and  territories,  and  3  percent  of  total  planning  funds  are  designated  for  Indian 
tribes.  The  remaining  planning  grant  funds  are  apportioned  according  to  the  fol-
lowing risk related factors: 

• One-fifth  of  the  remaining  funds  are  allocated  to  states  and  territories  on  the 
basis of their percentage of total population, with this measure serving as surro-
gate for risk to the general public. 
• Two-fifths  are  allocated  on  the  basis  of  a  State’s  or  Territory’s  percentage  of 
• The final two-fifths are allocated on the basis of a State’s or Territory’s percent-

total hazardous materials truck miles, a surrogate for highway hazmat risk. 

age of SARA 302 chemical facilities, a surrogate for fixed facility risk. 

The  base  amounts  plus  the  risk-related  apportionments  comprise  the  total  train-
ing grant allocations to states and territories. As with planning funds, all but 3 per-
cent  of  total  training  funds  (the  total  training  funds  designated  for  Indian  tribes) 
are apportioned on the basis of these risk-related factors: 

• One-half on the basis of population. 
• Three-tenths on the basis of total highway miles. 
• Two-tenths  on  the  basis  of  the  number  of  fixed  hazardous  materials  facilities 

that are identified by Census Bureau data. 

In  2007,  $12,800,000  was  available  for  HMEP  planning  and  training  grants.  Of 
this,  Nevada  received  $123,592  using  the  allocation  formula;  an  additional  $98,130 
was  awarded  to  Indian  tribes  in  Nevada.  Taking  this  into  account,  Nevada  ranked 
21st out of 50 states for HMEP grant awards. 

In  2008,  $21,300,000  was  available  for  HMEP  planning  and  training  grants.  Of 
this,  Nevada  received  $210,193,  and  $109,097  was  awarded  to  Indian  tribes  in  Ne-
vada. In 2008, Nevada ranked 27th out of 50 states for HMEP grant awards. 

Question  3.  In  2007,  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  officially  gave  Congress 
draft legislation that would abolish Department of Transportation’s (DOT) authority 
over  transportation  of  nuclear  waste  under  the  Hazardous  Materials  Authorization

103 

Act.  It  would  also  preempt  state  and  Indian  tribes’  transportation  requirements. 
While  there  is  no  chance  Congress  will  pass  such  sweeping  authority  to  the  DOE 
anytime  soon,  do  you  think  DOT  regulations  and  state  regulations  need  to  be  pre-
empted to facilitate a massive nuclear waste shipping campaign? 

Answer. PHMSA believes that spent nuclear fuel can be safely and securely trans-
ported  to  a  permanent  repository  under  current  law  and  PHMSA’s  existing  haz-
ardous materials transport safety program. The current regulatory program—based 
on  uniform,  federally-mandated  safety  controls  and  strong  Federal-State  partner-
ships  for  oversight  and  enforcement—has  achieved  an  exemplary  safety  record  for 
spent nuclear fuel movements over the past 50 years (1,500 shipments). 

Question  4.  The  DOT  requires  that  nuclear  waste  shipments  avoid  intermediate 
stops  to  avoid  potential  accidents  and  sabotage  during  stops.  What  role  does  or 
would the DOT play in the routing of nuclear waste shipments? 

Answer. DOT has established Federal standards and guidelines for routing of nu-
clear  waste  shipments.  Rail  routes  for  radioactive  materials  shipments  are  deter-
mined  by  rail  carriers,  subject  to  Federal  standards,  including  PHMSA’s  recent  in-
terim  final  rule  requiring  that  carriers  select  routes  posing  the  least  overall  safety 
and  security  risks.  Under  PHMSA’s  rule,  beginning  in  2009,  rail  carriers  trans-
porting  highway  route-controlled  quantities  of  radioactive  materials  must  analyze 
the safety and security risks along rail routes where such materials are transported, 
assess  alternative  routing  options  for  those  materials,  and  make  routing  decisions 
based on those assessments. Highway routing guidelines have been developed joint-
ly  by  PHMSA  and  the  Federal  Motor  Carrier  Safety  Administration.  These  guide-
lines  are  issued  in  DOT’s  publication  ‘‘Guidelines  for  Selecting  Preferred  Highway 
Routes  for  Highway  Route  Controlled  Quantity  Shipments  of  Radioactive  Mate-
rials.’’ Briefly, these guidelines require carriers to follow ‘‘preferred’’ routes; prepare 
and  file  route  plans;  provide  driver  training;  provide  emergency  response  training 
and  information;  and  follow  security  requirements.  They  also  establish  a  method-
ology for determining how a ‘‘preferred’’ route is selected. The methodology includes 
the following: route identification and comparison criteria; criteria to evaluate radi-
ation exposure to personnel and the environment; guidelines for assessing economic 
risk;  emergency  response  evaluation  methods;  and  general  highway  safety  criteria. 
Question  5.  How  would  the  DOT  ensure  that  trucks  hauling  nuclear  waste  are 

safe during required stops, such as refueling? 

Answer.  The  same  robust  design  and  construction  features  that  make  transpor-
tation  casks  safe  across  transport  accident  scenarios  also  limit  their  vulnerability 
to  sabotage,  theft,  and  diversion  during  transport.  In  addition  to  coordinating  all 
shipments  with  states,  Indian  tribes,  and  Federal  law  enforcement  agencies,  DOE 
will have in place the following standards: 

• Satellite  tracking  of  shipments,  with  access  to  tracking  information  by  appro-

priate Federal, State, and Tribal officials; 

• Notification  to  relevant  Governors  and  Tribal  leaders  before  transport  begins; 
• Special safeguard procedures for the shipper to follow in emergencies; 
• Escort training on threat recognition, response, and management; 
• Advance arrangements with law enforcement agencies along the route; 
• Armed escorts to accompany the shipment; 
• Escorts to maintain visual surveillance of the shipment at all times; 
• Status reporting by the escorts every 2 hours; 
• The capability to immobilize the cab or cargo-carrying portion of the vehicle (for 

highway shipments); and 

• Protection of specific information about any shipment. 
Question  6.  Out  of  72  commercial  sites  with  nuclear  waste,  one  third  of  them  do 
not  have  rail  access.  That  means  the  DOE  will  have  to  haul  waste  by  truck  from 
these  nuclear  reactors  either  all  the  way  to  Nevada  or  to  a  railway.  Does  adding 
steps  to  the  transportation  process  raise  security  or  safety  risks?  Has  the  DOT  ap-
proved this approach? 

Answer.  Coordination  between  the  Federal  Government  and  nuclear  utilities  will 
play an integral role in the planning and implementation of the transportation sys-
tem. Transporting waste to the repository will begin at the utilities when they pre-
pare  transportation  casks  for  DOE-managed  shipment.  As  current  owners  of  the 
fuel,  the  utilities  have  the  responsibility  of  training  their  personnel  appropriately 
to ensure the safe transfer of the waste to DOE, pursuant to DOT and NRC regula-
tions.

It is our understanding that DOE will update both the nuclear site capability as-
sessment  data  and  the  data  on  transportation  infrastructure  in  the  vicinity  of  sites 
that was collected in the early 1990s three to five years before shipments start. Site 
capability  data  identify  the  various  operating  capabilities  at  and  around  the  utility 
sites that are important to determining cask requirements and site servicing needs. 
Transport  infrastructure  data  provide  information  concerning  the  local  transpor-
tation  infrastructure  that  connects  the  utility  sites  with  the  nearest  mainline  rail 
or  interstate  highway  system.  Both  data  sets  will  be  used  to  develop  site-specific 
and final transportation requirements. 

DOT’s  hazardous  materials  transport  regulations  prescribe  safety  controls  pro-
viding  an  equivalent  level  of  safety  for  all  modes  of  transport  and  Federal  security 
requirements  apply  equally  across  all  modes  of  transport  considered  for  spent  nu-
clear fuel. Accordingly, hauling spent nuclear fuel from the reactor site to the near-
est railway will not adversely impact its safe and secure transport. As DOE has not 
completed  its  transportation  planning,  PHMSA  has  not  issued  any  transport  or 
packaging approval or permit to DOE for the transport of commercial spent nuclear 
fuel. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

KEN COOK 

Question. What outstanding questions do you think need to be resolved before the 

shipment of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain can begin? 

Answer. Chairman Inouye, the crucial issues surrounding the safety and security 
of  the  transportation  and  storage  of  lethal,  long-lived  nuclear  waste  in  the  United 
States must meet the highest scientific standards of objective, rigorous analysis and 
transparency of process. Unfortunately, the rush to approve and build the proposed 
Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository has not met these standards. 

Since 2002, EWG has helped educate the public about the implications of nuclear 
waste, with a particular focus on the implications of transporting deadly radioactive 
wastes  from  nuclear  power  plants  around  the  United  States  to  Yucca  Mountain, 
should  the  proposed  nuclear  waste  repository  there  become  operational.  The  Amer-
ican public’s fundamental right to understand the full implications of shipping thou-
sands  of  tons  of  extremely  hazardous  nuclear  waste  across  this  country  should  be 
central to the government’s process for licensing Yucca Mountain, for operating any 
other repository for this material, and for all decisions to relicense existing reactors 
or  build  new  ones.  The  Federal  Government  has  not  respected  this  right  to  know. 
There  are  many  examples  of  how  government  is  violating  people’s  right  to  know 
how  the  transportation  of  nuclear  waste  will  affect  them.  The  Department  of  En-
ergy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency 
have  not  implemented  the  safety  and  scientific  recommendations  of  the  National 
Academies  of  Sciences  1995  report  The  Technical  Basis  for  the  Yucca  Mountain 
Standard,  or  of  its  February  2006  report  Going  the  Distance?  The  Safe  Transport 
of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste in the United States. 

• EPA  has  not  proposed  or  set  a  public  health  radiation  safety  standard  that  is 

protective of people at peak exposure. 

• Both  the  Government  Accountability  Office  and  the  Nuclear  Waste  Technical 
Review  Board  have  questioned  basic  scientific  and  work  produced  by  DOE,  in-
cluding  its  characterization  of  the  physical  and  chemical  characteristics  of  the 
proposed Yucca Mountain site and the effectiveness of proposed man-made bar-
riers to the spread of lethal radiation. 

• Addressed  the  security  threats  posed  by  the  transportation  of  spent  nuclear 

• Planned  for  full  scale  physical  testing  of  spent  fuel  transportation  casks  to  de-

fuel. 

In addition, the foremost experts on Yucca Mountain have provided extensive de-
tail as to why the proposed nuclear waste dump site is geologically unsuitable. (See 
Yucca  Mountain  and  the  Nation’s  High-Level  Nuclear  Waste,  edited  by  Allison  M. 
Macfarlane and Rodney C. Ewing, 2006.) 

It makes no sense to generate tons more nuclear waste when we have not figured 
out what to do with the tens of thousands of tons already on hand. Our government 
has  ignored  that  common  sense  precaution.  Yet,  the  government  is  rushing  to  ap-

radiation  safety  standard.  We  should  not  burden  our  children  and  their  children 
with unacceptable risks. 

This result of the government’s push to license the proposed Yucca Mountain nu-
clear  waste  dump  and  its  subsidization  of  the  nuclear  industry  while  ignoring  the 
public health, environmental and economic costs of these activities virtually guaran-
tees that: 

• Nuclear  power  plants  would  be  transformed  into  long-term  nuclear  waste 
dumps. The recent surge in reactor relicensing ensures that hundreds of metric 
tons of extremely hazardous, high-level nuclear waste would remain in place at 
reactors around the country, as more waste is produced long after the proposed 
Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump would be full. 
• The proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump would have to be expanded 
or  a  second  repository  opened  to  accommodate  the  additional  waste.  By  law, 
Yucca  Mountain  is  limited  to  70,000  metric  tons  of  nuclear  waste,  which  is  al-
most equal to the amount of nuclear waste that will be stored on-site at reactors 
around the country in 2010, well before any repository could be opened. 
• If  rail  were  the  primary  means  of  transporting  the  waste,  the  security  and 
health  risks  inherent  in  these  shipments  are  enormous,  and  preparedness  is 
minimal. 
• The public would be unaware of, and unprepared for, the implications of policy 
decisions  regarding  nuclear  power  and  nuclear  waste  and  its  transportation 
through its neighborhoods. 

People  of  every  state  have  a  right  to  know  and  fully  understand  the  implications 
for them of shipping nuclear waste to the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository 
before  shipping  begins  or  the  license  for  the  facility  goes  forward.  And  they  have 
the  same  right  to  know  what  expansion  of  nuclear  waste  generation  will  mean  for 
transportation  through  their  state  if  reactors  around  the  country  are  relicensed  for 
10  to  20  additional  years  of  operation,  or  new  reactors  are  constructed.  They  may 
or  may  not  know  that  decisions  made  hundreds  of  miles  away  will  have  profound 
implications  for  the  shipment  of  high-level,  deadly  nuclear  waste  through  their 
neighborhoods for decades to come. 

I thank you, Chairman Inouye, for the opportunity to answer your questions. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

KEVIN CROWLEY 

Question.  Do  you  feel  that  the  recommendations  for  the  security  and  social  chal-
lenges of transporting nuclear waste in your 2006 National Academy of Sciences re-
port  have  been  adequately  addressed  by  the  DOE,  Department  of  Transportation, 
Department of Homeland Security, and the NRC? 

Answer.  To  my  knowledge,  the  Federal  agencies  have  not  addressed  the  rec-
ommendation in the National Academies 2006 report that an independent examina-
tion  of  the  security  of  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  be  carried  out  prior  to  the 
commencement  of  large-quantity  shipments  to  a  Federal  repository  or  to  interim 
storage. The National Academies committee that made this recommendation wanted 
this  independent  examination  to  be  carried  out  well  in  advance  of  the  start  of  the 
transportation program so that steps could be taken to address any deficiencies that 
were identified. Otherwise, the initiation of the transportation program could be de-
layed. 

DOE  is  taking  important  first  steps  to  address  the  social  challenges  identified  in 
our  2006  report.  It  is  seeking  advice  from  a  social  science  expert  and  its  external 
advisory  group  (Transportation  External  Coordination  Working  Group)  on  how  to 
address  the  social  challenges.  This  work  is  still  in  progress  and  it  is  too  soon  to 
judge whether it will be successful. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. HARRY REID TO 

KEVIN CROWLEY 

Question  1.  In  your  view,  has  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  adequately  ad-
dressed  recommendations  from  the  Academy’s  2006  report  that  they  make  public 
their  ‘‘suite  of  preferred  highway  and  rail  routes  for  transporting  nuclear  waste’’  to 
support state, local and emergency responder preparedness? What would be the con-
sequences of failing to engage state and local governments in routing nuclear waste 
shipments?

Answer.  In  my  view,  DOE  is  making  good  progress  in  addressing  this  rec-
ommendation  by  working  with  state,  tribal,  and  local  officials  to  develop  a  consult-
ative  process  for  selecting  highway  and  rail  routes  for  transporting  nuclear  waste 
to  a  geologic  repository.  This  work  is  being  carried  out  primarily  through  DOE’s 
Transportation  External  Coordination  Working  Group.  However,  to  my  knowledge, 
DOE  has  not  yet  announced  the  specific  routes  that  will  be  used  to  ship  spent  fuel 
and high-level waste to the repository should it be licensed and constructed. 

It  is  important  to  consult  with  state,  tribal,  and  local  governments  because  these 
entities  generally  have  better  knowledge  of  local  conditions,  for  example  traffic  and 
road conditions, that can affect the safety and security of shipments. Failure to con-
sult  with  these  governments  could  result  in  suboptimal  route  selections,  loss  of  co-
operation, and increased public resistance to shipping programs. 

Question 2. The Academy has recommended that the DOE should ship older spent 
fuel before they ship newer, more radioactive fuel. Please describe the public safety 
and  security  benefits  of  this  approach?  Has  the  DOE  ever  indicated  that  they  plan 
to follow this recommendation? 

Answer.  There  are  two  primary  benefits  for  shipping  older  fuel  first.  First,  it 
would provide an additional margin of safety, especially for reducing radiation doses 
to  transportation  personnel  who  work  in  close  proximity  to  the  shipping  casks  (the 
casks  do  not  shield  all  of  the  radiation  emitted  by  the  spent  fuel  contained  within 
them). In the Environmental Impact Statement for Yucca Mountain, DOE estimated 
that some transportation workers would receive the maximum annual amount of ra-
diation  allowed  by  DOE  occupational  administrative  limits  during  each  of  the  24 
years of the transportation program. That limit is currently 20 millisieverts (2 rem) 
per year. 

Second, shipping older fuel first would reduce the amount of radioactive material 
that  could  be  released  into  the  environment  as  a  result  of  a  severe  accident  or  ter-
rorist  attack  that  breached  the  shipping  cask.  The  risk  of  such  releases  is  under-
stood  to  be  very  small  for  severe  accidents  because  of  the  robust  construction  of 
shipping  casks.  The  National  Academies  has  not  undertaken  a  detailed  assessment 
of transportation security and therefore cannot comment on the risks. 

DOE has not indicated to the National Academies whether it intends to follow the 
recommendation to ship older fuel first. It is important to note, however, that under 
the requirements of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act DOE does not appear to have the 
legal  authority  to  require  spent  fuel  owners  to  offer  their  older  fuel  first  for  ship-
ment.  Consequently,  if  DOE  decided  to  follow  this  recommendation  it  would  prob-
ably have to negotiate with spent fuel owners. 

Question  3.  Would  transportation  risks  be  reduced  if  the  United  States  were  to 
store  spent  nuclear  fuel  onsite  at  nuclear  reactors  for  several  decades  before  ship-
ping it? What is the best age for nuclear fuel for transporting it with the least risk? 
Answer.  Storing  spent  fuel  onsite  for  several  decades  would  reduce  its  radioac-
tivity. Shipping lower-radioactivity fuel would likely reduce transportation risks, es-
pecially risks to transportation workers for the reasons noted in my response to the 
previous  question.  The  risks  would  continue  to  decrease  the  longer  the  fuel  was 
stored  onsite.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  risks  of  transporting  spent 
fuel, or storing it onsite for that matter, will always be greater than zero. 

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  if  DOE  ships  older  fuel  first  to  the  repository  using 
its  currently  planned  shipping  schedule  of  3,000  metric  tons  per  year,  most  spent 
fuel  will  have  been  stored  at  plant  sites  for  several  decades  before  it  is  shipped  to 
the repository. 

Question 4. In the Academy’s 2006 report, the Academy suggested that the DOE, 
U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  and  other  agencies  develop  clear  cri-
teria for protecting sensitive information while making public less-sensitive informa-
tion. Has information useful for community and emergency responder planning been 
made easily accessible? 

Answer.  The  information  that  would  be  helpful  to  community  and  emergency  re-
sponder  planners  include  the  following:  the  types  and  quantities  of  material  being 
shipped, shipping route(s), and shipping schedules. Some general information on the 
types  and  quantities  of  materials  to  be  shipped  to  a  repository  (if  it  is  licensed  and 
constructed)  is  publicly  available  in  DOE’s  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for 
Yucca  Mountain.  However,  to  my  knowledge,  DOE  has  not  yet  developed  specific 
shipping plans that contain the level of detailed information that would be required 
for  community  and  emergency  responder  planning.  Some  of  this  information  is  not 
normally  released  to  the  public  until  after  shipments  have  been  made  for  security 
reasons,  so  sharing  this  information  with  local  communities  could  be  problematic. 
Both  DOE  and  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  staff  have  expressed  an  interest  in

improving  the  sharing  of  relevant  information  with  state,  tribal  and  local  govern-
ments, but I do not know what specific progress has been made in this regard. 

Question 5. What measures could the DOE and NRC take to improve the security 
and  safety  of  nuclear  waste  transport?  Has  the  DOE  responded  to  the  Academy’s 
recommendation  that  an  independent  examination  of  the  security  of  nuclear  waste 
transportation be carried out? 

Answer.  The  National  Academies  report  entitled  ‘‘Going  the  Distance?  The  Safe 
Transport  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  and  High-Level  Radioactive  Waste  in  the  United 
States’’  made  several  recommendations  for  improving  the  safety  and  security  of 
spent fuel transport. These were mentioned in my written testimony and include the 
following four recommendations: 

1.  An  independent  examination  of  the  security  of  spent  fuel  and  high-level 
waste  should  be  carried  out  prior  to  the  commencement  of  large-quantity  ship-
ments  to  a  Federal  repository  or  to  interim  storage.  This  examination  should 
provide  an  integrated  evaluation  of  the  threat  environment,  the  response  of 
shipping packages to credible malevolent acts, and operational security require-
ments for protecting spent fuel and high-level waste while in transport. This ex-
amination  should  be  carried  out  by  a  technically  knowledgeable  group  that  is 
independent  of  the  government  and  free  from  institutional  and  financial  con-
flicts of interest. This group should be given full access to the necessary classi-
fied documents and Safeguards Information to carry out this task. The findings 
and  recommendations  from  this  examination  should  be  made  available  to  the 
public to the fullest extent possible. 

To my knowledge, DOE has not addressed this recommendation. 

2. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission should undertake additional analyses of 
accident  scenarios  involving  very  long  duration  fire  scenarios  that  bound  ex-
pected  real-world  accident  conditions  and  implement  operational  controls  and 
restrictions on spent fuel and high-level waste shipments as necessary to reduce 
the chances that such conditions might be encountered in service. 

Steps to address this recommendation have been taken by the Nuclear Regulatory 

Commission as noted in the testimony of Mr. Michael Weber. 

3.  DOE  should  ship  spent  fuel  and  high-level  waste  to  the  Federal  repository 
by ‘‘mostly rail’’ using dedicated trains. 

DOE’s  current  plans  for  shipping  to  the  repository  are  consistent  with  this  rec-

ommendation. 

4.  DOE  should  negotiate  with  commercial  spent  fuel  owners  to  ship  older  fuel 
first to a Federal repository or to Federal interim storage. Should these negotia-
tions  prove  to  be  ineffective,  Congress  should  consider  legislative  remedies. 
Within  the  context  of  its  current  contracts  with  commercial  spent  fuel  owners, 
DOE should initiate transport to the Federal repository through a pilot program 
involving  relatively  short,  logistically  simple  movements  of  older  fuel  from 
closed  reactors  to  demonstrate  its  ability  to  carry  out  its  responsibilities  in  a 
safe and operationally effective manner. 

As  described  in  my  answer  to  a  previous  question,  DOE  has  not  indicated  to  the 
National  Academies  whether  it  intends  to  follow  the  recommendation  to  ship  older 
fuel  first.  DOE  also  has  not  indicated  whether  it  will  initiate  transport  with  the 
pilot program described above. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

DR. JAMES DAVID BALLARD 

Question. Your testimony contends that too many questions remain regarding the 
security  of  nuclear  waste  shipments.  What  areas  need  to  be  researched  further  in 
order  to  more  fully  understand  the  national  security  risks  of  transporting  nuclear 
waste? 

Answer.  Thank  you,  Senator  Inouye,  I  am  happy  to  provide  additional  details  on 
specific  research  projects  that  should  be  conducted  prior  to  the  commencement  of 
any shipments to the proposed Yucca facility. 

Besides the ten items noted in my written and oral testimony that were identified 
by  stakeholders  as  needing  to  be  addressed  by  the  DOE  and  NRC  prior  to  Yucca 
shipments, the Committee should also consider the following: 

• First and foremost, what I believe is needed is a systematic analysis of realistic 
worse  case  attack  scenarios  and  their  consequences.  These  could  emerge  from 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:56 Apr 17, 2013 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\80371.TXT JACKIE

the  AVA  process  I  discussed  in  testimony.  That  process  expertise  already  re-
sides  in  a  national  laboratory  environment—specifically  Dr.  Roger  Johnson  at 
Argonne National Laboratory. This analysis would offer usable scenarios, exam-
ples of which I tried to illustrate in my written testimony, which could be used 
as  the  basis  of  consequence  analysis.  It  is  critical  that  examples  are  not  sani-
tized  by  the  regulatory  agencies  that  fail  to  look  at  such  alternatives  in  their 
published analysis. 

• Next I would suggest a National Academies of Science level assessment of 21st 
century terrorist motivations, tactics and weapons and their consequences/impli-
cations for radioactive shipment security and planning. Agencies seem to be ap-
proaching  this  problem  from  a  Cold  War  mindset—perhaps  we  should  consider 
not just that what will be shipped are ‘waste’ products but rather potential radi-
ological dispersion devices that can be attacked and the contents dispersed into 
the  environment.  These  materials  need  not  be  captured  but  rather  we  should 
consider  how  and  if  it  can  be  used  along  the  transportation  routes  as  a  means 
to attack this country, contaminate transportation infrastructure and other dire 
consequences. 

• Once  we  have  listed  the  worst  cases  and  defined  motivations  for  adversaries 
then  we  could  make  more  useful  comparisons  between  the  proposed  shelter-in- 
place  strategy  of  leaving  the  waste  at  reactor  sites  in  secure  dry  storage  facili-
ties  and  shipping  the  waste  across  country  to  a  repository.  This  would  also  de-
mand  a  full  accounting  of  the  transportation  planning—as  it  is  now  the  DOE 
has  not  defined  the  transportation  system  in  enough  detail  to  even  allow  for 
such  an  analysis.  To  meet  that  need  you  should  consider  requiring  the  DOE  to 
engage in a national level transportation related NEPA process. 

• Lastly,  one  immediate  item  that  could  be  undertaken  is  a  organizational  level 
study of law enforcement and emergency responder awareness, capabilities and 
needs  relative  to  the  unprecedented  high-level  radioactive  waste  shipping  cam-
paign required for the Yucca Mountain program. No national level study exists 
on  what  these  state  and  local  agencies  will  need,  what  they  have  currently  in 
terms  of  equipment  and  expertise,  and  what  funding  will  be  necessary  in  the 
future  if  Yucca  shipments  commence.  It  seems  reasonable  to  establish  a  base-
line now so that transportation planning and financial and technical assistance 
can  assist  in  offsetting  any  funding  impacts  this  proposed  project  would  entail. 
Thank  you  again  for  asking  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  the  Committee. 

If I can be of any additional service please do not hesitate to ask. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

EDWARD R. HAMBERGER 

Question.  In  your  testimony,  you  expressed  concern  that  the  DOE  has  not  yet 
committed  to  using  dedicated  train  service  for  shipping  nuclear  waste  on  all  routes 
across  the  Nation.  Do  you  have  any  additional  comments  on  why  the  DOE  appears 
to be hesitating in requiring the use of these trains across your system? 

Answer. AAR thinks that DOE should explain why it is hesitating. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. HARRY REID TO 

EDWARD R. HAMBERGER 

Question 1. Will the AAR oppose the Department of Energy’s (DOE) all-rail trans-
portation plan for nuclear waste if they refuse to commit to dedicated train service? 
Answer.  AAR  recognizes  that  because  of  the  safety  advantages  afforded  by  rail 
transportation, rail is likely to be the preferred mode for transporting spent nuclear 
fuel.  Even  though  DOE  has  not  committed  to  dedicated  train  service,  AAR  is  opti-
mistic  that,  ultimately,  DOE  will  decide  to  use  dedicated  train  service  because  of 
its safety advantages, as discussed in my testimony. 

Question  2.  The  DOE  is  not  in  the  railroad  business  today.  Do  you  believe  that 
the  DOE  is  prepared  to  not  only  build  and  operate  the  largest  new  rail  line  since 
the  1930s,  but  to  launch  a  nationwide  campaign  to  make  thousands  of  shipments 
of nuclear waste?

Answer. There is no question it takes a high degree of expertise to build and oper-
ate  a  railroad.  DOE,  of  course,  can  contract  with  railroad  industry  experts  to  build 
and operate the rail line.
