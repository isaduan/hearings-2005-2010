HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  11:05  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Bart  Gordon
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman  GORDON.  Welcome,  everyone,  to  the  Committee  of
Science and Technology, and we will come to order. Pursuant to no-
tice, the Committee meets to consider the following measures: H.R.
547,  the  Advanced  Fuels  Infrastructure  Research  and  Development
Act; H.Res. 72, Recognition of the work and accomplishments of Mr.
Britt  Max  Mayfield,  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center’s
Tropical Prediction Center upon his retirement. We are moving for-
ward  now  for  two  reasons:  one  is  because  it  is  time  to  move  for-
ward,  and  the  second  is  that  we  are  going  to  be  having  votes  in
about  15  minutes.  And  if  some  of  your  Members  aren’t  here  yet,
we  are  not  trying  to  preempt  them  but  rather  provide  them  the
courtesy  of  being  able  to  get  to  vote  and  not  have  to  come  back.
We  now  will  consider  H.Res.  72,  Recognizing  the  work  and  ac-
complishments of Mr. Britt ‘‘Max’’ Mayfield, Director of the National
Hurricane  Center’s  Tropical  Prediction  Center  upon  his  retirement.
I yield myself five minutes.

Today,  as  I  said,  the  House  will  consider  H.Res.  72,  introduced
by  Representative  Tim  Mahoney.  H.Res.  72  recognizes  the  work
and  the  accomplishments  of  Mr.  ‘‘Max’’  Mayfield,  who  recently  re-
tired  from  his  position  as  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Cen-
ter’s Tropical Prediction Center. The NOAA Hurricane Center, part
of NOAA’s National Weather Service, has been a focal point of the
Nation’s  hurricane  forecast  and  warnings  programs  for  50  years.
The mission of the Hurricane Center is to save lives, mitigate prop-
erty  loss  by  issuing  the  best  watches,  warnings,  and  forecasts  of
hazardous  tropical  weather.  Mr.  Mayfield  attained  national  celeb-
rity  status  during  the  period  of  2004  and  2005  hurricane  season,

appearing on television with hourly updates as Hurricanes Charlie,
Ivan,  Francis,  Wilma  bore  down  on  the  Southeastern  United
States.  With  his  calm  and  steady  presence,  Mr.  Mayfield  helped
millions  of  Americans  prepare  for  hurricanes  during  his  tenure
with  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  H.Res.  72  thanks  Mr.
Mayfield  for  his  service,  which  has  undoubtedly  helped  to  save
countless lives and the property of citizens around the world.

Mr.  Mayfield  will  be  missed.  He  has  served  our  nation  with  dis-
tinction  for  30  years.  I  can  think  of  no  better  mentor  and  teacher
for  our  current  and  future  meteorological  professionals.  Mr.
Mayfield’s  knowledge,  experience,  and  sound  direction  have  been
assets to the safety of our nation and security of our citizens. I ask
my colleagues on the Committee to support this resolution.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Today the Committee will consider House Resolution 72, introduced by Represent-

ative Tim Mahoney.

H.Res. 72 recognizes the work and accomplishments of Mr. Max Mayfield, who re-
cently retired from his position as Director of the National Hurricane Center’s Trop-
ical Prediction Center.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Hurri-
cane  Center,  part  of  NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service,  has  been  the  focal  point  of
the  Nation’s  hurricane  forecast  and  warning  program  for  50  years.  The  mission  of
the  hurricane  center  is  to  save  lives  and  mitigate  property  loss  by  issuing  the  best
watches, warnings, and forecasts of hazardous tropical weather.

Mr. Mayfield attained national celebrity status during the tempestuous 2004 and
2005  hurricane  seasons,  appearing  on  television  with  hourly  updates  as  hurricanes
Charley,  Ivan,  and  Wilma  bore  down  on  the  Southeastern  United  States.  With  his
calm  and  steadying  presence,  Mr.  Max  Mayfield  helped  millions  of  Americans  pre-
pare for hurricanes during his tenure with the National Hurricane Center.

H.Res.  72  thanks  Mr.  Mayfield  for  his  service,  which  has  undoubtedly  helped  to

save countless lives and the property of citizens around the world.

In addition, this resolution commends Mr. Mayfield’s dedication to expanding edu-
cational  opportunities  for  State  and  local  emergency  management  officials  and  ac-
knowledges the critical role that Mr. Mayfield has played in forecast and service im-
provements over his 34-year career.

Born  in  Oklahoma,  Mr.  Mayfield  holds  a  Bachelor’s  degree  in  mathematics  from
the  University  of  Oklahoma  and  a  Master’s  degree  in  meteorology  from  Florida
State  University.  Getting  his  start  on  the  ground  floor,  Max  joined  the  hurricane
center  in  1972  as  an  intern.  In  1988,  he  became  a  hurricane  forecaster,  rising  to
senior forecaster two years later. Mr. Mayfield was named Deputy Director in 1998
and became Acting Director in January 2000 when Jerry Jarrell retired.

Mr.  Mayfield  will  be  missed.  He  has  served  our  nation  with  distinction  for  over
30 years. Mr. Mayfield is well known to all of our citizens, especially those in hurri-
cane-prone  areas.  Mr.  Mayfield’s  leadership  of  his  forecasting  team  at  the  National
Hurricane  Center,  his  clear  presentation  of  hurricane  forecasts,  and  his  abilities  to
coordinate  and  communicate  with  local  emergency  management  personnel  resulted
safer and better informed communities.

The National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center—under the Di-
rectorship of Mr. Mayfield—did an excellent job of predicting the track of the storm
and  issuing  watches  and  warnings  that  permitted  State  and  local  officials  to  evac-
uate many of the people who were in the path of this devastating storm.

The U.S. Department of Commerce recognized Mr. Mayfield with Gold Medals for
his work during Hurricane Andrew (1992) and Hurricane Isabel (2003), and a Silver
Medal  during  Hurricane  Gilbert  (1988).  He  was  also  awarded  a  National  Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Bronze Medal for creating a public-private
partnership to support the Nation’s disaster preparedness.

Max Mayfield has set a high standard for future Directors of the Hurricane Cen-

I  suspect  he  will  continue  to  be  involved  in  meteorology  through  his  membership

in the American Meteorological Society.

I can think of no better mentor and teacher for current and future meteorological

ter.

professionals.

Mr. Mayfield’s knowledge, experience and sound direction have been assets to the
safety  of  our  nation  and  the  security  of  our  citizens.  I  ask  my  colleagues  on  the
Committee to support this resolution.

Chairman  GORDON.  And  now  I  recognize  Mr.  Bonner  for  five

minutes.

Mr. BONNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As one of the few Mem-
bers  of  the  Gulf  Coast  who  has  had  firsthand  experience  dealing
with Mr. Mayfield, I, too, commend you for bringing this resolution
to  the  Floor  today,  and  am  pleased  that  the  Committee  is  consid-
ering H.Res. 72, Recognizing the work and accomplishments of Mr.
Britt  ‘‘Max’’  Mayfield,  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center’s
Tropical Prediction Center upon his retirement.

For 34 years, Mr. Mayfield served our country as a meteorologist.
For  the  last  six  years,  however,  he  was  the  face  and  voice  Ameri-
cans  turned  to  and  trusted  for  the  latest  information  about  hurri-
canes and tropical storms. Over the years, his forecasts have saved
thousands of lives by providing advanced warnings so people could
evacuate prior to storms hitting.

For  each  tropical  storm  or  hurricane  that  threatens  America’s
coastline,  Mr.  Mayfield  and  the  staff  of  the  National  Hurricane
Center,  worked  around  the  clock,  gathering  information  about  the
storms  and  constantly  improving  the  projection  of  the  storm’s
track.  As  the  storm  nears  the  U.S.  coast,  they  often  spend  days  at
a time at the National Hurricane Center making sure that the pub-
lic  continues  to  receive  vital  forecasts  and  warning  information.
Throughout his distinguished career, Mr. Mayfield went above and
beyond  his  responsibilities  by  spending  much  of  the  off-season
doing outreach to communities to make sure they are prepared for
hurricanes  and  know  what  to  do  to  protect  themselves  from  these
deadly storms.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  join  my  colleagues  in  honoring
this outstanding public servant. Just a few minutes ago, I had the
pleasure  of  meeting  with  eight  young  ladies,  who  are  here  as  part
of ‘‘Students of the Storm,’’ young students, who have come up from
New Orleans, to remind America that the devastation of Hurricane
Katrina  still  exists.  And  I  know  they  believe,  as  we  all  do,  that
‘‘Max’’  Mayfield  helped  save  lives,  even  during  the  worst  natural
disaster in American history.

I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Bonner, and we look forward
to your active participation in the NOAA legislation this year. You
have firsthand knowledge and can be a real asset to us.

Does anyone else wish to be recognized?
Then I ask unanimous consent that the bill is considered as read
and  open  to  amendment,  and  that  Members  proceed  with  the
amendments  in  the  order  of  the  roster.  Without  objection,  so  or-
dered.

Are there any amendments?
Hearing  none,  the  vote  is  on  the  bill,  H.Res.  72,  Recognizing  the
work and accomplishments of Mr. Britt ‘‘Max’’ Mayfield, Director of
the  National  Hurricane  Center’s  Tropical  Prediction  Center  upon
his  retirement.  All  of  those  in  favor  will  say  aye.  All  of  those  op-
posed, say no. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.

I recognize Mr. Hall to offer a motion.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Committee  favorably
report  H.Res.  72  to  the  House  with  the  recommendation  that  the
bill  do  pass.  Furthermore,  I  move  that  the  staff  be  instructed  to
make  necessary  technical  and  conforming  changes,  and  that  the
Chairman  take  all  necessary  steps  to  bring  the  bill  before  the
House for consideration.
I yield back my time.
Chairman  GORDON.  The  question  is  on  the  motion  to  report  the
bill  favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by  saying
aye.  Opposed,  no.  The  ayes  have  it,  and  the  bill  is  favorably  re-
ported.

Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I move that Members have two subsequent calendar days in which
to submit supplemental, minority, or additional views on the meas-
ure.  I  move  pursuant  to  Clause  1  of  the  Rule  22  of  the  House  of
Representatives,  that  the  Committee  authorize  the  Chairman  to
offer such motions as may be necessary in the House to adopt and
pass  H.Res.  72,  Recognizing  the  work  and  accomplishments  of  Mr.
Britt  ‘‘Max’’  Mayfield,  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center’s
Tropical  Prediction  Center  upon  his  retirement.  Without  objection,
so ordered.

And  let  me  say  to  our  new  Members  and  other  Members  today.
This  was  a  bit  of  a  bim-bam  operation  today,  the  reason  being  a
couple of things. First of all, these bills were well vetted. They were
bipartisan. Also, we had consultation with our other committees of
jurisdiction.  And  as  I  mentioned  to  you,  we  are  going  to  be  having
votes any moment now. Let this be the opening of discussion about
climate change, of energy, and of alternative energies. We have got
a lot to do here. I know that Mrs. Biggert has a couple of bills that
she  has  just  introduced.  We  are  looking  forward  to  those.  Mrs.
Biggert,  we  are  glad  you  are  here.  And  we  welcome  other  bills  on
this  issue.  We  want  to  try  to  get  a  good  idea,  vet  it  well,  take  it
out  and  get  it  passed,  and  then  we  hope  that  you  will  talk  with
senators in your states, and we will get some things done.

So  I  want  to  thank  the  Members  for  their  attendance,  and  this

concludes our markup.

[Whereupon, at 11:29 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE  FULL  COMMITTEE
MARKUP  ON  H.CON.RES.  76,  HONORING  THE
50TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE 
INTER-
NATIONAL  GEOPHYSICAL  YEAR  (IGY)

WEDNESDAY,  MARCH  28,  2007

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:07  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Bart  Gordon
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman  GORDON.  Good  morning.  The  Committee  on  Science

and Technology will come to order.

Pursuant  to  notice,  the  Committee  meets  to  consider  the  fol-
lowing  measures:  H.R.  362,  ‘‘10,000  Teachers,  10  Million  Minds’’
Math  and  Science  Scholarship  Act;  H.Con.Res.  76,  Honoring  the
50th  Anniversary  of  the  International  Geophysical  Year;  and  H.R.
252, Recognizing the 45th Anniversary of John Herschel Glenn Jr.’s
Historic Achievement in Becoming the First United States Astronaut
to Orbit the Earth.

We will now proceed with the markup.
Today, we are meeting to markup three bipartisan bills.
I  realize  that  I  am  starting  to  sound  like  a  broken  record,  but
I  sincerely  hope  that  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  is
a  place  where  Members  of  both  parties  can  come  together  to  get
work done on important issues in a bipartisan way.

The important, non-partisan issue of this markup is competitive-
ness. This is one of the most critical issues facing our nation today.
H.R.  362,  the  ‘‘10,000  Teachers,  10  Million  Minds’’  Science  and
Math  Scholarship  Act,  which  I  sponsored  and  which  my  friend,
Ralph  Hall,  co-sponsored,  takes  a  big  step  forward  in  dealing  with
the vital issues.

Together  with  H.R.  363,  which  this  committee  reported  out  ear-
lier this month, these bills take the recommendations from the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences ‘‘Rising Above the Gathering Storm’’ re-
port,  and  turn  them  into  real  legislation  that  will  make  a  dif-
ference.

In  addition  to  H.R.  362,  we  are  also  marking  up  two  other  bills.
H.Con.Res.  76  is  a  resolution  honoring  the  50th  anniversary  of
the  International  Geophysical  Year,  an  international  cooperative
initiative  that  led  to  significant  advances  in  space  and  Earth
science, and which was marked by the dawn of the Space Age.

H.Res.  252  recognizes  the  45th  anniversary  of  John  Glenn’s  his-
toric space mission, in which he became the first American to orbit
the Earth.

The space race of the 1950’s and 1960’s helped advance—to drive
scientific achievement and technological innovation in the 20th cen-
tury,  and  it  is  fitting  that  today,  as  we  honor  the  scientific  and
technological  achievements  of  the  past,  we  are  also  helping  to  en-

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Today we are meeting to markup three bipartisan bills.
I realize that I’m starting to sound like a broken record, but I sincerely hope that
the Committee on Science and Technology is a place where Members of both parties
can come together to get work done on important issues in a bipartisan way.

The  important,  non-partisan  issue  of  this  markup  is  U.S.  competitiveness.  This
is  one  of  the  most  critical  issues  facing  our  nation  today.  H.R.  362,  the  ‘‘10,000
Teachers,  10  Million  Minds’’  Science  and  Math  Scholarship  Act,  which  I  sponsored
and  Ralph  Hall  co-sponsored,  takes  a  big  step  forward  in  dealing  with  this  vital
issue.

Together  with  H.R.  363,  which  this  committee  reported  out  earlier  this  month,
these  bills  take  recommendations  from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  ‘‘Rising
Above  the  Gathering  Storm’’  report,  and  turn  them  into  real  legislation  that  will
make a difference.

In addition to H.R. 362, we are also marking up two other bills.
H.Con.Res.  76  is  a  resolution  honoring  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  International
Geophysical  Year,  an  international  cooperative  initiative  that  led  to  significant  ad-
vances in space and Earth science, and which was marked by the dawn of the Space
Age.

H.Res. 252 recognizes the 45th anniversary of John Glenn’s historic space mission

in which he became the first American to orbit the Earth.

The space race of the 1950’s and 1960’s helped to drive scientific achievement and

technological innovation in the 20th century.

It  is  fitting  that  today,  as  we  honor  the  scientific  and  technological  achievements
of the past, we are also helping to insure this country’s ability to make these great
gains in the future.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  present  his  opening

remarks.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you,  of  course,  as  usual,  for

calling this markup today.

We  have  before  us  three  measures,  as  you  have  stated,  and  a
very  important  piece  of  innovation  and  competitiveness  agenda
that  targets  improving  the  caliber  of  our  future  K–12  math  and
science teachers and two space-related resolutions.

With regard to H.R. 362, I am very pleased to see us considering
the  bill.  It  has  many  of  the  elements  that  this  committee  passed
last  year.  As  I  have  stated  before,  I  am  especially  pleased  to  see
that  we  are  using  the  University  of  Texas’s  UTeach  program  for
the basis for a scholarship program for STEM students who commit
to teaching K–12 science and math classes after graduation.

Now  I  understand  that  there  will  be  an  amendment  in  the  na-
ture of a substitute offered to H.R. 362, which includes agreed-upon
improvements to the bill.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  really  do  thank  you  for  working  with  our  side,
as you have always done, on making these improvements, not only
to  the  underlying  measure,  but  also  with  regards  to  H.R.  524,  the
Partnership for Access to Laboratory Science Act, which I believe is
also going to be offered as an amendment to H.R. 362.

Okay. With that, I yield back my time.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall, for your support of the
bill and, more importantly, for your good additions to make a good
bill even better.

Without  objection,  Members  may  place  statements  in  the  record

at this point.

We now offer—we now will consider H.Con.Res. 76, Honoring the
50th Anniversary of the International Geophysical Year. I yield Mr.
Udall five minutes to describe his bill.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  am  pleased  that  we  are  here  today  to  markup  H.Con.Res.  76,
which  is  a  concurrent  resolution  honoring  the  50th  anniversary  of
the International Geophysical Year, also known as the IGY.

The  resolution  marks  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  International
Geophysical  Year,  honors  its  contributions  to  space  research,  and
looks forward to future accomplishments.

I  want  to  thank  several  of  my  colleagues  from  the  Science  and
Technology  Committee  that  joined  me  as  original  co-sponsors,  and
in  particular  I  would  thank,  the  Space  and  Aeronautics  Sub-
committee  Ranking  Member  Calvert,  Chairman  Gordon,  and  Re-
search  and  Science  Education  Subcommittee  Chairman  Baird  for
their support.

The  International  Geophysical  Year  of  1957/1958  was  a  highly-
successful  international  effort  involving  67  nations  that  came  to-
gether  during  the  Cold  War  to  coordinate  global  observations  and
measurements  of  the  solid  Earth,  oceans,  the  atmosphere,  and  the
near-Earth space environment.

During  the  IGY,  successful  launches  of  the  first  artificial  sat-
ellites  took  place,  Sputnik  1  by  the  former  Soviet  Union,  and  Ex-
plorer 1 by the United States, marking the dawn of the space age.
The  Explorer  1  also  enabled  one  of  the  most  notable  achievements
of  the  IGY,  the  discovery  of  the  belts  of  trapped,  charged  particles
in  the  Earth’s  upper  atmosphere  by  the  late  Dr.  James  Van  Allen
of Iowa.

I  introduced  a  similar  resolution  in  the  108th  Congress,  which
passed  the  House,  to  honor  the  IGY  and  to  encourage  the  celebra-
tion  of  its  50th  anniversary  throughout  the  country  and  the  globe.
This  year’s  commemoration  serves  to  not  only  remember  the
great  scientific  work  that  was  done  during  this  period,  but  also  to
inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, who will be
critical to our continued progress and economic well being.

In  that  regard,  H.Con.Res.  76  encourages  the  public  and  in  par-
ticular  our  young  people  to  participate  in  celebrations  planned  for
the  IGY  anniversary  year  and  to  embrace  challenging  goals  for  fu-
ture  research  in  Earth  and  space  science.  So  that  we  will  be  able
to  look  back,  50  years  from  now,  on  equally  exciting  accomplish-
ments and discoveries.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  this  important
resolution  at  today’s  markup  in  order  that  we  may  recognize  and
honor  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  International  Geophysical  Year.

Thank you, and I would yield back my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  pleased  that  we  are  here  today  to  mark  up
H.Con.Res. 76, Honoring the 50th Anniversary of the International Geophysical Year
(IGY).

This resolution marks the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year
(IGY), honors its contributions to space research, and looks forward to future accom-
plishments.

I am pleased that several of my colleagues from the Science and Technology Com-
mittee  have  joined  me  as  original  co-sponsors  and  would  like  to  thank  Space  and
Aeronautics  Subcommittee  Ranking  Member  Calvert,  Chairman  Gordon,  Research
and Science Education Subcommittee Chairman Baird for their support.

The  International  Geophysical  Year  of  1957–1958  was  a  highly  successful  inter-
national  effort  involving  67  nations  that  came  together  during  the  Cold  War  to  co-
ordinate  global  observations  and  measurements  of  the  solid  Earth,  oceans,  the  at-
mosphere, and the near-Earth space environment.

During  the  IGY,  the  successful  launches  of  the  first  artificial  satellites  took
place—Sputnik 1 by the former Soviet Union and Explorer 1 by the United States—
marking the dawn of the Space Age.

Explorer 1 also enabled one of the most notable achievements of the IGY, the dis-
covery of belts of trapped, charged particles in the Earth’s upper atmosphere by the
late Dr. James Van Allen of Iowa.

I introduced a similar resolution in the 108th Congress, which passed the House,
to honor the IGY and to encourage the celebration of its 50th anniversary through-
out the country and the globe.

This year’s commemoration serves to not only remember the great scientific work
that  was  done  during  the  IGY,  but  also  to  inspire  the  next  generation  of  scientists
and  engineers,  who  will  be  critical  to  our  continued  progress  and  economic  well
being.

In  that  regard,  H.Con.Res.  76  encourages  the  public  and  in  particular  our  young
people  to  participate  in  celebrations  planned  for  the  IGY  anniversary  year  and  to
embrace  challenging  goals  for  future  research  in  Earth  and  space  science—so  that
we  will  be  able  to  look  back,  50  years  from  now,  on  equally  exciting  accomplish-
ments and discoveries.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  H.Con.Res.  76  at  today’s  markup
in  order  that  we  may  recognize  and  honor  the  fiftieth  anniversary  of  the  Inter-
national Geophysical Year.

Thank you and I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Udall.
The  Chair  recognizes  Mr.  Hall  to  present  any  remarks  on  the

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, I don’t think there is any disagreement
on this committee that it is appropriate to recognize the 50th anni-
versary  of  the  International  Geophysical  Year  and  all  of  its  con-
tributions to scientific research.

We  passed  this  exact  same  resolution  two  years  ago  in  anticipa-
tion  of  the  upcoming  International  Polar  Year,  which  has  now  ar-
rived.  I  believe  the  point  of  the  resolution  then  was  to  encourage
participation  in  future  IGYs.  Well,  we  are  actively  participating
now.

I am not sure that I understand why we have chosen to omit any
mention of the current IPY in this resolution, as our committee has
jurisdiction  over  the  most  prominent  federal  agency  participating
in it.

In  addition  to  NASA,  which  this  resolution  highlights,  the  Na-
tional  Science  Foundation  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  and  the  Department  of  Energy  are  all  very
actively participating. In fact, NSF is the lead U.S. agency for this
endeavor.

Now  Mr.  Chairman,  I  support  this  resolution,  because  I  agree
with  everything  it  states,  however,  I  believe  the  current  IPY  also
has  a  potential  to  have  an  even  greater  impact  on  our  future.  On

a day when we are reporting innovation and competitiveness legis-
lation,  I  feel  it  is  only  appropriate  to  also  tip  our  hats  to  the  cur-
rent  IPY  that  ‘‘promises  to  bring  about  fundamental  advances  in
many areas of science and to fire the enthusiasm of young men and
women for careers in science and engineering.’’

At this time, I would like to yield Mr. Calvert the balance of my

time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  not  think  there  is  any  disagreement  on  this  committee  that
it is appropriate to recognize the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical
Year (IGY) and ALL of its contributions to scientific research. We passed this exact

to encourage participation in future ‘‘IGYs.’’ Well, we are actively participating now.
I  am  not  sure  I  understand  why  we  have  chosen  to  omit  any  mention  of  the  cur-

tively participating. In fact, NSF is the lead US agency for this endeavor.

Mr. Chairman, I support this resolution because I agree with everything it states;
however,  I  believe  the  current  IPY  also  has  the  potential  to  have  an  even  greater
impact on our future. On a day when we are reporting innovation and competitive-

and to fire the enthusiasm of young men and women for careers in science and engi-
neering.’’

Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, Mr. Hall.
I have, really, no further comment other than the fact that I am
happy  to  join  Congressman  Udall  as  an  original  co-sponsor  and
would encourage everyone’s support, and I certainly share the com-
ments of Mr. Hall, also.

Thank you.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall and Mr. Calvert.
Does anyone else wish to be recognized?
I ask unanimous consent the bill is considered as read and open
to amendment and that any Members—and that Members proceed
with the amendments in the order of the roster. Without objection,
so ordered.

Are there any amendments?
Hearing none, the vote is on the bill, H.Con.Res. 76. All in favor
will  say  aye.  All  of  those  opposed,  say  no.  In  the  opinion  of  the
Chair, the ayes have it.

I recognize Mr. Hall for a motion.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Committee  favorably
report  House  Concurrent  Resolution  76  to  the  House  with  the  rec-
ommendation  that  the  bill  do  pass.  Furthermore,  I  move  that  the
staff  be  instructed  to  make  necessary  technical  and  conforming
changes  and  that  the  Chairman  take  all  necessary  steps  to  bring
the bill before the House for consideration.

I yield back.
Chairman GORDON. The question on the motion to report the bill
favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by  saying  aye.
Opposed, no. The ayes have it. The bill is favorably reported.

Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I move that Members have two subsequent calendar days in which
to submit supplemental, minority, or additional views on the meas-
ure.  I  move  pursuant  to  Clause  1  of  Rule  22  of  the  Rules  of  the
House of Representatives that the Committee authorize the Chair-
man  to  offer  such  motions  as  may  be  necessary  in  the  House  to
adopt  and  pass  H.Con.Res.  76,  Honoring  the  50th  Anniversary  of
the  International  Geophysical  Year.  Without  objection,  so  ordered.
I  want—let  me,  again,  thank  all  you  Members  today.  This  has
been another, I think, productive markup, bipartisan, non-partisan,
that  I  hope  that  everyone  will  go  home  and  take  credit  for  it,  be-
cause you all deserve it.

And  I  will  see  you  on  the  Floor  probably  the  first  week  that  we

come back.

And the Committee is adjourned.

can come together to get work done on important issues in a bipartisan way.

The  important,  non-partisan  issue  of  this  markup  is  U.S.  competitiveness.  This
is  one  of  the  most  critical  issues  facing  our  nation  today.  H.R.  362,  the  ‘‘10,000
Teachers,  10  Million  Minds’’  Science  and  Math  Scholarship  Act,  which  I  sponsored
and  Ralph  Hall  co-sponsored,  takes  a  big  step  forward  in  dealing  with  this  vital
issue.

Together  with  H.R.  363,  which  this  committee  reported  out  earlier  this  month,
these  bills  take  recommendations  from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  ‘‘Rising
Above  the  Gathering  Storm’’  report,  and  turn  them  into  real  legislation  that  will
make a difference.

In addition to H.R. 362, we are also marking up two other bills.
H.Con.Res.  76  is  a  resolution  honoring  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  International
Geophysical  Year,  an  international  cooperative  initiative  that  led  to  significant  ad-
vances in space and Earth science, and which was marked by the dawn of the Space
Age.

H.Res. 252 recognizes the 45th anniversary of John Glenn’s historic space mission

in which he became the first American to orbit the Earth.

The space race of the 1950’s and 1960’s helped to drive scientific achievement and

technological innovation in the 20th century.

It  is  fitting  that  today,  as  we  honor  the  scientific  and  technological  achievements
of the past, we are also helping to insure this country’s ability to make these great
gains in the future.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  present  his  opening

remarks.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you,  of  course,  as  usual,  for

calling this markup today.

We  have  before  us  three  measures,  as  you  have  stated,  and  a
very  important  piece  of  innovation  and  competitiveness  agenda
that  targets  improving  the  caliber  of  our  future  K–12  math  and
science teachers and two space-related resolutions.

With regard to H.R. 362, I am very pleased to see us considering
the  bill.  It  has  many  of  the  elements  that  this  committee  passed
last  year.  As  I  have  stated  before,  I  am  especially  pleased  to  see
that  we  are  using  the  University  of  Texas’s  UTeach  program  for
the basis for a scholarship program for STEM students who commit
to teaching K–12 science and math classes after graduation.

Now  I  understand  that  there  will  be  an  amendment  in  the  na-
ture of a substitute offered to H.R. 362, which includes agreed-upon
improvements to the bill.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  really  do  thank  you  for  working  with  our  side,
as you have always done, on making these improvements, not only
to  the  underlying  measure,  but  also  with  regards  to  H.R.  524,  the

Partnership for Access to Laboratory Science Act, which I believe is
also going to be offered as an amendment to H.R. 362.

Okay. With that, I yield back my time.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall, for your support of the
bill and, more importantly, for your good additions to make a good
bill even better.

Without  objection,  Members  may  place  statements  in  the  record

at this point.

Chairman  GORDON.  We  will  now  consider  H.Res.  252,  Recog-
nizing  the  45th  Anniversary  of  John  Herschel  Glenn,  Jr.’s  Historic
Achievement in Becoming the First United States Astronaut to Orbit
the Earth. Can you believe it? It was 45 years.

I yield Mr. Wilson five minutes to describe his bill.
Mr. WILSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  am  pleased  to  be  an  original  co-sponsor  of  House  Resolution
252,  which  commends  the  accomplishments  of  John  Glenn,  an
American hero from my State of Ohio.

As a young man, John Glenn was a dedicated military officer, fly-
ing 149 missions during two wars. In 1959, he was selected as one
of  the  original  seven  astronauts  in  the  United  States  Space  Pro-
gram.

John Glenn’s courage inspired the Nation and paved the way for
generations of space exploration. As a Senator, he has helped build
a  safer  world  by  co-authoring  the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Act.
Since  his  retirement  from  the  Senate,  he  has  contributed  in  many
ways  to  the  greatness  of  America,  especially  by  founding  the  John
Glenn  School  of  Public  Affairs  at  the  Ohio  State  University,  which
instills  his  values  of  courage,  integrity,  and  service  into  the  next
generation of American leaders.

As a Member of the Science and Technology Committee in Ohio,
and  I  am  very  pleased  to  be  a  co-sponsor  of  this  legislation,  hon-
oring the 45th anniversary of John Glenn’s orbital flight.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I encourage my colleagues to sup-

port this resolution.

on the bill.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, House Resolution 252 honors the 45th
anniversary,  as  you  have  stated,  of  John  Glenn,  Jr.’s  historic  mis-
sion  as  the  first  American  to  circle  the  Earth  aboard  the  Mercury
spacecraft, Friendship 7. His mission completed three orbits around
the Earth, reaching an approximate maximum altitude of 162 stat-
ute  miles  and  an  approximate  orbital  velocity  of  17,500  miles  per
hour.  This  was  truly  a  landmark  event  in  the  progress  of  our
human space flight program, and it was important as a catalyst to
space exploration and scientific advancement in the United States.
These  early  successes  captured  the  minds  and  the  imaginations  of
people all around the world.

After  retiring  from  the  space  program,  John  Glenn  continued  to
serve  his  country  as  a  distinguished  Member  of  the  Senate  for  24
years,  and  in  1998,  John  Glenn  returned  to  space  after  36  years
as  a  member  of  the  crew  of  the  Space  Shuttle  Discovery,  serving
as a subject for basic research into the effects of weightlessness on
the body of an older person.

John  Glenn  is  truly  an  American  hero.  And  it  is  high  time  we

start recognizing these old guys.

And I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Mr.  Chairman,  House  Resolution  252  honors  the  45th  anniversary  of  John  Her-
schel  Glenn,  Jr.’s  historic  mission  as  the  first  American  to  circle  the  Earth  aboard
the  Mercury  spacecraft  ‘‘Friendship-7.’’  His  mission  completed  three  orbits  around
Earth, reaching an approximate maximum altitude of 162 statute miles and an ap-
proximate orbital velocity of 17,500 miles per hour. This was truly a landmark event
in the progress of our human space flight program, and was important as a catalyst
to  space  exploration  and  scientific  advancement  in  the  United  States.  These  early
successes  captured  the  minds  and  imaginations  of  people  around  the  world.  After
retiring  from  the  space  program,  John  Glenn  continued  to  serve  his  country  as  a
distinguished  Member  of  the  Senate  for  24  years.  In  1998,  John  Glenn  returned  to
space after 36 years as a member of the crew of the space shuttle Discovery, serving
as  a  subject  for  basic  research  into  the  effects  of  weightlessness  on  the  body  of  an
older person. John Glenn is truly an American hero.

Chairman GORDON. Mr. Hall, are you volunteering for service?
Mr.  HALL.  I  would  like  to  volunteer  the  guy  that  is  going  to  run

against me for a space flight.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  this  resolution  will  be  on  the  Floor,  as
mentioned,  and  we  welcome  everyone  that  wants  to  come  to  that.
If there are any remarks now? John Glenn is a very decent, coura-
geous public servant. I guess to quote someone, we are all Ohioans
today, because he is for everybody.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, can I tell you a story about Glenn real

brief?

Chairman GORDON. Certainly.
Mr.  HALL.  He  was  tired,  and  the  campaign  for  President,  came
home  all  beat  down,  had  a  hard  day.  He  was  going  down  in  the
rankings and everything, and he came in and his wife was not just
overly  comforting  to  him,  but  his  dog  ran  up  and  licked  his  hand.
And  he  said,  ‘‘You  know,  when  I  come  home,  I  ought  to  have  at
least two friends here.’’ She bought him another dog.

Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman?
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Calvert is recognized.
Mr.  CALVERT.  I  just  want  to  certainly  join  in  our  admiration  of
John  Glenn,  but  I  also  want  to  point  out  another  Ohioan,  Neil
Armstrong. And I think we are going to have an opportunity, hope-
fully, later this Congress, to recognize him, also. So I hope we take
that opportunity to do so.

Chairman  GORDON.  We  will  welcome  that  opportunity  and  look

forward to your leadership in that regard.

Anyone else?
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Will the Chairman yield?
Chairman GORDON. Certainly.
Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Does  all  this  talk  mean  we  have  to  be  for

ment, pertinent or not?

Okay.  If  not,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  the  bill  is  considered  as
read  and  open  to  amendment  at  any  point  and  that  the  Members
proceed with the amendment in the order of the roster. Without ob-
jection, so ordered.

Are there any amendments?
Hearing  none,  the  vote  is  on  the  bill,  H.Res.  252.  All  those  in
favor,  say  aye.  All  of  those  opposed,  say  no.  In  the  opinion  of  the
Chair, the ayes have it.

I will recognize Mr. Hall to offer a motion.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Committee  favorably
report  House  Resolution  252  to  the  House  with  the  recommenda-
tion that the bill do pass. Furthermore, I move that the staff be in-
structed  to  make  necessary  technical  and  conforming  changes  and
that the Chairman take all necessary steps to bring the bill before
the House for consideration.

I yield back.
Chairman GORDON. The question on the motion to report the bill
favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by  saying  aye.
Opposed, no. The ayes have it. The bill is favorably reported.

Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I move that Members have two subsequent calendar days in which
to submit supplemental, minority, or additional views on the meas-
ure.  I  move  pursuant  to  Clause  1  of  Rule  22  of  the  Rules  of  the
House of Representatives that the Committee authorize the Chair-
man  to  offer  such  motions  as  may  be  necessary  in  the  House  to
adopt  and  pass  H.Res.  252,  Recognizing  the  45th  Anniversary  of
John  Herschel  Glenn,  Jr.’s  Historic  Achievement  in  Becoming  the
First United States Astronaut to Orbit the Earth. Without objection,
so ordered.

Let  me,  again,  thank  all  you  Members  today.  This  has  been  an-
other,  I  think,  productive  markup,  bipartisan,  non-partisan,  that  I
hope that everyone will go home and take credit for it, because you
all deserve it.

And  I  will  see  you  on  the  Floor  probably  the  first  week  that  we

come back.

And the Committee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:17 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

CAREER  AND  RESEARCH  ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS  OF  FRANCES  E.  ALLEN,  THE  2006
RECIPIENT  OF  THE  A.M.  TURING  AWARD

WEDNESDAY,  APRIL  25,  2007

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:00  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Bart  Gordon
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman  GORDON.  The  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
will  come  to  order.  Pursuant  to  notice,  the  Committee  on  Science
and  Technology  meets  to  consider  the  following  measures,  H.R.
1867,  the  National  Science  Foundation  Authorization  Act  of  2007;
H.R.  1868,  Technological  Innovation  and  Manufacturing  Stimula-
tion  Act  of  2007;  H.Con.Res.  95,  Honoring  the  career  and  research
accomplishments of Frances E. Allen, the 2006 recipient of the A.M.
Turing Award; and H.Res. 316, Recognizing the accomplishments of
Roger D. Kornberg, Andrew Fire, Craig Mello, John C. Mather, and
George  F.  Smoot  for  being  awarded  Nobel  Prizes  in  the  fields  of
chemistry, physiology or medicine, and physics.

And we will now proceed with the markup. Today the Committee
is  meeting  to  markup  four  good,  bipartisan  bills.  The  first  bill  we
will  consider  today  is  H.R.  1867,  the  National  Science  Foundation
Authorization  Act  of  2007.  H.R.  1867  was  introduced  by  Chairman
Baird,  Ranking  Member  Ehlers,  and  other  Members  of  the  Re-
search  and  Science  Education  Subcommittee.  The  Subcommittee
met  last  Wednesday  to  consider  H.R.  1867  and  favorably  reported
the  bill  by  voice  vote  after  adopting  three  amendments.  I  want  to
thank  and  congratulate  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  for  their
hard work and bipartisan cooperation on this excellent bill.

The  core  of  this  bill  is  the  three-year  authorization  that  keeps
the Foundation on a ten-year doubling path. NSF is a major source
of  federal  backing  for  basic  research  at  universities  across  all  dis-
ciplines,  and  Members  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee
often have a difficult time explaining to our constituents and other
Members of Congress why it is so important to fund basic research.
The  benefits  to  you  and  me  can  seem  so  intangible  in  comparison
to many of the other things the Federal Government does. But with
the publicity around the recent reports like Rising Above the Gath-

ering  Storm,  more  of  our  colleagues  and  constituents  understand
that federally funded research pays enormous dividends to society.
Economic  growth,  public  health,  national  defense,  and  social  ad-
vancements  have  all  been  tied  to  technological  developments  re-
sulting  from  basic  research.  Let  me  just  quickly  add  that  as  we
know,  there  is  a  long  time  between  basic  research  and  applied  re-
search; and what we are talking about really—when we look at the
big problems today, whether they are energy independence, wheth-
er it is climate change, whether it is competitiveness, our kids’ and
grandkids’ jobs really are going to depend upon the technology that
is developed today. There are seven billion people in the world, half
of  which  make  less  than  $2  a  day.  We  can’t  compete  with  them  at
$2.  We  don’t  want  to.  So  it  is  the  technologies  that  we  are  devel-
oping  today  that  are  going  to  let  our  kids  and  grandkids  be  more
productive,  and  that  is  why  it  is  so  important  that  the  National
Science Foundation continue to do its work.

In  addition  to  providing  strong  research  budgets,  H.R.  1867  pro-
vides  important  funding  for  some  critical  STEM  education  pro-
grams  including  three  K–12  programs  this  committee  expanded
and  refined  in  H.R.  362  which  I  am  happy  to  say  just  passed  the
House  yesterday.  And  again,  I  want  to  thank  everyone  here  for
that bipartisan work. It is a good bill. Mr. Gingrey spoke on it, and
certainly  Ralph  and  others  spoke  to  that.  I  hope  that  everybody  is
in their local newspapers today because you were all a part of this
bill, and it is a very good bill.

And I am pleased that H.R. 1867 once again reaffirms the critical
role  that  the  National  Science  Foundation  plays  with  STEM  edu-
cation.  This  is  a  good  bill,  and  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  it
and  continue  to  work  with  me  to  assure  that  the  rest  of  our  col-
leagues  in  Congress  understand  the  value  of  basic  research  as  we
do.

Today we will also take up H.R. 1868, the Technological Innova-
tion and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. This is an author-
ization bill for the programs of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, NIST. This bill is a bipartisan product of the Tech-
nology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee,  and  I  want  to  commend
Chairman  Wu  and  Ranking  Member  Gingrey  for  moving  this  bill
through  the  Subcommittee  expeditiously.  The  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Committee  needs  to  send  a  strong  signal  to  the  Appropria-
tions Committees about the importance we place on full funding of
NIST.  The  pace  of  technology  keeps  accelerating,  particularly  in
areas  such  as  biofuels,  pharmaceutical  biologics,  and  health  care
IT.  NIST  has  an  important  role  to  play  in  the  adoption  of  these
technologies  through  the  creation  of  standards  and  the  new  meas-
urement technologies.

And  let  me  speak  just  a  moment  on  this.  You  know,  NIST  is
probably  one  of  the  most  under-estimated  aspects  of  the  Federal
Government. It was originally meant to take care of measures and
standards.  Now  it  goes  much  beyond  that,  and  I  think  it  is  an
agency  that  all  of  us  can  feel  comfortable  with  because  this  is  not
a  regulatory  agency.  This  is  an  agency  that  brings  together  the
business  community  and  the  manufacturing  community,  to  work
out  problems  on  standards.  And  I  think  you  are  going  to  find  that
our  committee  here,  besides  the  Technology  and  Innovation  Sub-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

35

committee,  is  going  to  get  a  lot  more  respect  within  Washington
and elsewhere because of this agency. We are where the Commerce
Committee has been stagnant in terms of health care IT. Ways and
Means  hasn’t  been  able  to  go  forward.  We  are  going  to  be  able  to
step  forward  and  solve  some  of  those  problems  where  the  health
care  community  is  going  to  look  at  the  Science  and  Technology
Committee  as  the  one  who  made  that  breakthrough.  Financial
services is going to look at us pretty soon as a committee that can
make  those  kind  of  breakthroughs  because  of  NIST.  So  we  are
going to continue working on that, and I think you are going to see
NIST help us to make our committee much more relevant.

The Committee is also aware of the important role that the Man-
ufacturing  Extension  Partnership,  MEP,  plays  in  keeping  good
manufacturing  jobs  here  in  the  United  States,  and  NIST  has  a
proven  track  record  of  implementing  its  technology  development
programs.

Finally,  the  last  two  measures  we  are  considering  today,
H.Con.Res.  95  and  H.Res.  316  recognize  the  outstanding  achieve-
ments  of  a  group  of  American  scientists.  It  is  important  that  Con-
gress recognize Americans who achieve great things in science, not
just for the satisfaction of individual scientists but to show the pub-
lic that Congress truly values the work that scientists do.

And  now  I  will  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  present  his  opening  state-

ment.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Good  Morning.  Pursuant  to  notice,  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology

meets to consider the following measures:

In  addition  to  providing  strong  research  budgets,  H.R.  1867  provides  important
funding for some critical STEM education programs, including three K–12 programs
that  this  committee  expanded  and  refined  in  H.R.  362,  which  I  am  happy  to  say
just passed the House yesterday.

The  education  programs  at  NSF  are  perhaps  more  tangible  to  the  typical  Amer-
ican,  as  everybody  wants  their  children  to  be  taught  by  highly  qualified  teachers
and  to  graduate  high  school  and  community  college  prepared  for  the  workforce  of
the  21st  Century,  or  to  have  the  opportunity  to  pursue  even  higher  degrees  if  they
so desire.

I am pleased that H.R. 1867 once again reaffirms the critical role that NSF plays
in  STEM  education.  This  is  a  good  bill.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  it,  and  to
continue to work with me to ensure that the rest of our colleagues in Congress un-
derstand the value of basic research as we do.

Today,  we’ll  also  take  up  H.R.  1868,  the  Technology  Innovation  and  Manufac-
turing Stimulation Act of 2007. This is an authorization bill for the programs of the
National institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

This  bill  is  the  bipartisan  product  of  the  Technology  and  Innovation  Sub-
committee.  I  want  to  commend  Chairman  Wu  and  Ranking  Member  Gingrey  for
moving  this  bill  through  the  Subcommittee  expeditiously.  The  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Committee  needs  to  send  a  strong  signal  to  the  Appropriations  Committee
about the importance we place on full funding for NIST.

H.R. 1868 places the NIST budget on the path to doubling over the next 10 years.
The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  has  always  been  in  the  ‘‘amen  corner’’  for
fully funding all of NIST.

The pace of technology keeps accelerating—particularly in areas such as biofuels,
pharmaceutical biologics and health care IT. NIST has an important role to play in
the adoption of these technologies through the creation of standards and new meas-
urement technologies.

This committee is also aware of the important role that the Manufacturing Exten-
sion  Partnership  (MEP)  program  plays  in  keeping  good  manufacturing  jobs  here  in
the U.S. And NIST has a proven track record in implementing its technology devel-
opment  program.  H.R.  1868  does  an  excellent  job  of  balancing  and  funding  these
priorities and everyone on this committee should support this legislation.

Finally,  the  last  two  measures  we  are  considering  today,  H.Con.Res.  95  and
H.Res.  316,  recognize  the  outstanding  achievements  of  a  group  of  American  sci-
entists.

It  is  important  that  Congress  recognizes  Americans  who  achieve  great  things  in
the  sciences,  not  just  for  the  satisfaction  of  the  individual  scientists,  but  to  show
the public that the Congress truly values the work that scientists do.

I recognize Mr. Hall to present his opening remarks.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  chance  to  make
some  opening  remarks.  Of  course,  as  you  say,  we  are  considering
two  authorization  bills  relating  to  the  President’s  American  Com-
petitive  Initiative  and  two  resolutions  honoring  the  accomplish-
ments of some very eminent American scientists.

The  National  Science  Foundation  Authorization  Act  of  2007  au-
thorizes funding for NSF for the next three fiscal years. This meas-
ure  goes  a  long  way  in  keeping  with  the  President’s  ACI  plan  to
double the budget within ten years. In fact, it goes slightly beyond
that  to  incorporate  some  of  the  additions  to  education  programs
that the House passed just yesterday.

I appreciate the work of the Subcommittee Ranking Member, Mr.
Ehlers,  for  his  dedication  and  work  on  this  bill;  and  I  thank  the
Chairman  and  I  thank  Congressman  Baird  for  their  willingness  to
cooperate on making this really a truly bipartisan endeavor. I look
forward to our continuing working together to improve this legisla-
tion and pass it with broad support.

I  am  also  pleased  that  we  are  marking  up  H.R.  1868,  the  Tech-
nology  Innovation  and  Manufacturing  Stimulation  Act  of  2007.
H.R.  1868  supports  the  President’s  ACI  by  setting  the  NIST  lab
budget  on  a  path  to  double  by  fiscal  year  2017.  This  bill  ensures
that America’s small- and medium-sized manufacturers have access

to  the  latest  technologies  and  processes  by  authorizing  the  Manu-
facturing Extension Partnership Program.

Finally,  H.R.  1868  authorizes  the  Technology  Innovation  Pro-
gram  to  promote  the  swift  development  of  high-risk  research  into
marketable  technologies.  And  I  thank  Dr.  Ehlers  and  Dr.  Gingrey
for  their  extensive  input  into  developing  this  bill,  as  well  as  the
staff who dedicated considerable time in this endeavor. Also I want
to  thank  my  Democratic  colleagues  for  incorporating  these  impor-
tant priorities in this bipartisan legislation.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  also  pleased  this  committee  will  honor  six
esteemed  American  scientists  today.  H.Con.Res.  95  recognizes  the
first  woman  to  receive  the  prestigious  computer  science  A.M.
Turing Award, Frances Allen. H.Res. 316 honors the five American
scientists  who  received  Nobel  Prizes  in  2006,  Roger  Kornberg  for
chemistry,  Andrew  Fire  for  medicine,  Craig  Mello  for  Medicine,
John Mather for physics, and George Smoot for physics.

Before  I  close,  I  want  to  point  out  that  the  NSF  and  NIST  bills,
as  you  have  said,  Mr.  Chairman,  both  major  pieces  of  legislation,
were  developed  after  only  a  few  hearings  on  each  topic,  only  one
in  the  case  of  NIST.  These  hearings  were  at  the  subcommittee
level, so only a few Members of the Committee were able to attend
the  hearings.  Also,  with  regard  to  the  NIST  bill,  there  was  never
a  hearing  on  the  New  Technology  Innovation  Program.  In  fact,
these two bills were put together so quickly we have yet to receive
all  the  witnesses’  response  and  questions—their  response  to  the
questions  for  the  record  submitted  by  Members  of  the  Committee.
So  Mr.  Chairman,  while  I  certainly  support  these  bills  in  their
current  form,  once  I  have  received  all  of  the  witnesses’  response,
I,  or  some  other  Members,  may  want  to  propose  further  amend-
ments  to  these  bills  when  they  are  considered  on  the  House  Floor.
I know you will work with us on that.

With  that,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time,  and  I  thank  you
for  laying  out  a  good  bill  and  preparing  for  a  good  hearing.  I  yield
back.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL
• H.R. 1867, National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007
• H.R. 1868, Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007
• H.Con.Res.  95,  Honoring  the  Career  and  Research  Accomplishments  of
• H.Res.  316,  Recognizing  the  accomplishments  of  Roger  D.  Kornberg,  Andrew
Fire,  Craig  Mello,  John  C.  Mather,  and  George  F.  Smoot  for  being  award
Nobel  Prizes  in  the  fields  of  chemistry,  physiology  or  medicine,  and  physics.
Thank  you,  Chairman  Gordon,  for  the  chance  to  make  some  opening  remarks
about  today’s  markup.  Today  we  are  considering  two  authorization  bills  related  to
the President’s American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) and two resolutions hon-
oring the accomplishments of eminent American scientists.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) Authorization Act of 2007, H.R. 1867, au-
thorizes  funding  for  NSF  for  the  next  three  fiscal  years.  This  measure  goes  a  long
way in keeping with the President’s ACI plan to double the budget within ten years.
In fact, it goes slightly beyond that to incorporate some of the additions to education
programs  that  the  House  passed  yesterday.  I  appreciate  the  work  of  the  Sub-
committee  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Ehlers,  for  his  dedication  and  work  on  this  bill
and thank the Chairman and Mr. Baird for their willingness to cooperate on making
this a bipartisan endeavor. I look forward to our continuing to work together to im-
prove this legislation and pass it with broad support.

I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation
and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. H.R. 1868 supports the President’s ACI
by  setting  NIST’s  lab  budget  on  a  path  to  double  the  budget  by  fiscal  year  2017.
The  bill  will  ensure  America’s  small-  and  medium-sized  manufacturers  have  access
to the latest technologies and processes by authorizing the Manufacturing Extension
Partnership Program. Finally, H.R. 1868 authorizes the Technology Innovation Pro-
gram  to  promote  the  swift  development  of  high-risk  research  into  marketable  tech-
nologies. I thank Dr. Ehlers and Dr. Gingrey for their extensive input in developing
this  bill  and  my  Democratic  colleagues  for  incorporating  our  priorities  into  this  bi-
partisan legislation.

I  also  am  pleased  the  Committee  will  honor  six  esteemed  American  scientists
today. H.Con.Res. 95 recognizes the first woman to receive the prestigious computer
science A.M. Turner award, Frances Allen. H.Res. 316 honors the five American sci-
entists  who  received  Nobel  prizes  in  2006:  Roger  Kornberg  for  chemistry;  Andrew
Fire  for  medicine;  Craig  Mello  for  medicine;  John  Mather  for  physics;  and  George
Smoot for physics.

Before I close, I want to point out that the NSF and NIST bills, both major pieces
of  legislation,  were  developed  after  only  one  hearing  on  each  topic.  Those  hearings
were at the Subcommittee level, so only a few Members of the Committee were able
to  attend  the  hearings.  In  the  case  of  the  NIST  bill  there  was  never  a  hearing  on
the  new  Technology  Innovation  Program.  In  fact,  these  two  bills  were  put  together
so  quickly  that  we  have  yet  to  receive  all  of  the  witnesses’  responses  to  questions
for  the  record  submitted  by  Members  of  this  committee.  Therefore,  Mr.  Chairman,
while I support these bills in their current form, once I have reviewed all of the wit-
nesses responses I, or other Members, may want to propose further amendments to
these bills when they are considered on the House Floor.

With that I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall. Let me assure you that
we want to continue to work in the spirit that we have to get good
bills.  You  know,  the  last  NIST  authorization  was  in  1992  out  of
this  committee.  It  has  been  five  years  since  we  had  a  National
Science Foundation authorization. There have been lots of hearings
in  between,  but  you  know,  it  is  time  to  get  something  done;  and
we  want  to  have  the  best  bill  possible,  and  you  can  be  absolutely
assured that we will continue with that collaboration.

Without  objection,  Members  may  place  statements  in  the  record

at this point.

We now will consider H. Con. Resolution 95, Honoring the career
and research accomplishments of Frances E. Allen, the 2006 recipi-
ent  of  the  A.M.  Turing  Award.  I  yield  Ms.  Woolsey  five  minutes  to
describe this resolution.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  bring-
ing  H.Con.Res.  94  before  the  Committee 
for  consideration.
H.Con.Res.  95  honors  a  pioneer  in  the  world  of  computing,  Dr.
Frances Allen, the first woman awarded the A.M. Turing Award by
the Association for Computing Machinery, ACM.

The  Turing  Award  is  widely  considered  to  be  actually  the  Nobel
Prize  of  computing  and  by  being  the  first  female  recipient,  Dr.
Allen  is  highlighted  as  a  role  model  for  women  everywhere  to  as-
pire to a career in math and science.

As  a  scientist  at  IBM  since  the  early  1960s,  Dr.  Allen  pioneered
new technologies which serve as the basis for complex theories that
are  widely  used  today  throughout  the  computer  industry.  Because
of  this,  she  was  also  the  first  woman  to  be  recognized  as  an  IBM
Fellow in 1989.

It  should  come  as  no  surprise  to  any  Member  of  this  committee
that  the  Nation’s  IT  workforce  is  suffering  from  a  lack  of  qualified
candidates.  It  is  certainly  telling  that  women  who  earn  more  than
half  of  all  undergraduate  degrees  in  this  country  and  make  up

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

39

more than half of the professional workforce represent only 25 per-
cent  of  all  IT  workers.  In  fact,  that  percentage  of  women  grad-
uating with degrees in computer science has fallen from 37 percent
of total graduates in ’95 to just 15 percent in 2005.

With grim statistics like these, it is clear that if we are going to
close  the  gap  and  ensure  the  information  technologies  sector  has
enough workers, we must get young women into this workforce.

Besides  her  outstanding  scientific  achievements,  Dr.  Allen  has
also  been  an  inspirational  mentor  to  all  young  researchers  and  a
leader within the computing community. She is an Advisory Coun-
cil member of the Anita Board Institute for Women and Technology
whose  goal  is  to  increase  participation  of  women  in  all  aspects  of
technology. It is clear that Dr. Allen deserves recognition for all the
tireless work she has done to promote women’s roles in computing.
Mr. Chairman, Dr. Frances Allen is a role model for scientists ev-
erywhere.  Having  succeeded  at  the  highest  levels  of  math  and
science,  I  therefore  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  this  bill  and  not
only congratulate Dr. Allen on her success but show that this Con-
gress  appreciates  her  setting  the  bar  high  in  her  support  of  an  in-
creased presence of women in science and technology.

With that I yield back.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Ms. Woolsey, and I recognize Mr.

Hall to present any remarks on the resolution.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  Ms.  Woolsey  has  very  adequately  set
out the reasons that this lady is being honored and respectfully has
done  it  in  a  great  manner.  It  is  a  good  resolution  honoring  a  true
pioneer,  and  I  am  pleased  to  support  the  resolution.  I  yield  back
my time.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you. Does anyone else wish to be rec-
ognized? If not, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution is con-
sidered as read and open to amendment at any point and that the
Members  proceed  with  the  amendments  in  the  order  of  the  roster.
Without objection, so ordered.

The  first  amendment  on  the  roster  is  offered  by  the  gentlelady
from  California,  Ms.  Woolsey.  Are  you  ready  to  proceed  with  your
amendment?

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  an  amendment  at  the

desk.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with

the reading. Without objection, so ordered.

The  gentlelady  is  recognized  for  five  minutes  to  explain  her

amendment.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Chairman, in drafting this bill, mention of the
Association for Computing Machinery was inadvertently left out of
my  bill,  and  the  amendment  simply  adds  the  following  whereas
statement,  whereas  the  Association  for  Computing  Machinery,  an
international  organization  of  computing  professionals,  gives  the
A.M.  Turing  Award  annually  to  individuals  whose  contributions  in
the  field  of  computing  are  long-lasting  and  are  of  major  technical
importance.  That  is  the  end  of  the  change  and  additions,  Chair-
man.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Woolsey.  Is  there  further
discussion  on  the  amendment?  If  not,  the  vote  occurs  on  the
amendment. All in favor say aye, those opposed no. The ayes have
it, and the amendment is agreed to.

Are  there  other  amendments?  Hearing  none,  the  vote  is  on  the
resolution,  H.Con.Res.  95  as  amended.  All  those  in  favor  will  say
aye,  all  those  opposed  no.  In  the  opinion  of  the  Chair,  the  ayes
have it.

I recognize Mr. Hall to offer a motion.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Committee  favorably
report  House  Concurrent  Resolution  95,  as  amended,  to  the  House
with  the  recommendation  that  the  bill  do  pass.  Further,  I  move
that  staff  be  instructed  to  make  necessary  technical  and  con-
forming  changes  and  that  the  Chairman  take  all  the  necessary
steps  to  bring  the  resolution  before  the  House  for  consideration.  I
yield back.

Chairman  GORDON.  The  question  is  on  the  motion  to  report  the
resolution  favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by
saying  aye,  opposed  no.  The  ayes  have  it,  and  the  resolution  is  fa-
vorably reported.

Without objection the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I  move  the  Members  have  two  subsequent  calendar  days  in  which
to  submit  supplemental  minority  or  additional  views  on  the  meas-
ure.  I  move  pursuant  to  Clause  1  of  Rule  22  of  the  Rules  of  the
House of Representatives that the Committee authorize the Chair-
man  to  offer  such  motions  as  may  be  necessary  in  the  House  to
adopt  and  pass  H.Con.Res.  95,  Honoring  the  career  and  research
accomplishments of Frances E. Allen, the 2006 recipient of the A.M.
Turing Award, as amended. Without objection, so ordered.

And finally, let me look at all of you say thank you for being the
hard  core  and  staying  here  as  we  completed  our  business.  We  had
four  good  resolutions  today,  and  I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  again;
and this meeting is concluded.

[Whereupon, at 11:28 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

OF 

WEDNESDAY,  APRIL  25,  2007

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:00  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Bart  Gordon
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman  GORDON.  The  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
will  come  to  order.  Pursuant  to  notice,  the  Committee  on  Science
and  Technology  meets  to  consider  the  following  measures,  H.R.
1867,  the  National  Science  Foundation  Authorization  Act  of  2007;
H.R.  1868,  Technological  Innovation  and  Manufacturing  Stimula-
tion  Act  of  2007;  H.Con.Res.  95,  Honoring  the  career  and  research
accomplishments of Frances E. Allen, the 2006 recipient of the A.M.
Turing Award; and H.Res. 316, Recognizing the accomplishments of
Roger D. Kornberg, Andrew Fire, Craig Mello, John C. Mather, and
George  F.  Smoot  for  being  awarded  Nobel  Prizes  in  the  fields  of
chemistry, physiology or medicine, and physics.

And we will now proceed with the markup. Today the Committee
is  meeting  to  markup  four  good,  bipartisan  bills.  The  first  bill  we
will  consider  today  is  H.R.  1867,  the  National  Science  Foundation
Authorization  Act  of  2007.  H.R.  1867  was  introduced  by  Chairman
Baird,  Ranking  Member  Ehlers,  and  other  Members  of  the  Re-
search  and  Science  Education  Subcommittee.  The  Subcommittee
met  last  Wednesday  to  consider  H.R.  1867  and  favorably  reported
the  bill  by  voice  vote  after  adopting  three  amendments.  I  want  to
thank  and  congratulate  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  for  their
hard work and bipartisan cooperation on this excellent bill.

The  core  of  this  bill  is  the  three-year  authorization  that  keeps
the Foundation on a ten-year doubling path. NSF is a major source
of  federal  backing  for  basic  research  at  universities  across  all  dis-
ciplines,  and  Members  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee
often have a difficult time explaining to our constituents and other

Members of Congress why it is so important to fund basic research.
The  benefits  to  you  and  me  can  seem  so  intangible  in  comparison
to many of the other things the Federal Government does. But with
the publicity around the recent reports like Rising Above the Gath-
ering  Storm,  more  of  our  colleagues  and  constituents  understand
that federally funded research pays enormous dividends to society.
Economic  growth,  public  health,  national  defense,  and  social  ad-
vancements  have  all  been  tied  to  technological  developments  re-
sulting  from  basic  research.  Let  me  just  quickly  add  that  as  we
know,  there  is  a  long  time  between  basic  research  and  applied  re-
search; and what we are talking about really—when we look at the
big problems today, whether they are energy independence, wheth-
er it is climate change, whether it is competitiveness, our kids’ and
grandkids’ jobs really are going to depend upon the technology that
is developed today. There are seven billion people in the world, half
of  which  make  less  $2  a  day.  We  can’t  compete  with  them  at  $2.
We  don’t  want  to.  So  it  is  the  technologies  that  we  are  developing
today that are going to let our kids and grandkids be more produc-
tive,  and  that  is  why  it  is  so  important  that  the  National  Science
Foundation continue to do its work.

In  addition  to  providing  strong  research  budgets,  H.R.  1867  pro-
vides  important  funding  for  some  critical  STEM  education  pro-
grams  including  three  K–12  programs  this  committee  expanded
and  refined  in  H.R.  362  which  I  am  happy  to  say  just  passed  the
House  yesterday.  And  again,  I  want  to  thank  everyone  here  for
that bipartisan work. It is a good bill. Mr. Gingrey spoke on it, and
certainly  Ralph  and  others  spoke  to  that.  I  hope  that  everybody  is
in their local newspapers today because you were all a part of this
bill, and it is a very good bill.

And I am pleased that H.R. 1867 once again reaffirms the critical
role  that  the  National  Science  Foundation  plays  with  STEM  edu-
cation.  This  is  a  good  bill,  and  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  it
and  continue  to  work  with  me  to  assure  that  the  rest  of  our  col-
leagues  in  Congress  understand  the  value  of  basic  research  as  we
do.

Today we will also take up H.R. 1868, the Technological Innova-
tion and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. This is an author-
ization bill for the programs of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, NIST. This bill is a bipartisan product of the Tech-
nology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee,  and  I  want  to  commend
Chairman  Wu  and  Ranking  Member  Gingrey  for  moving  this  bill
through  the  Subcommittee  expeditiously.  The  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Committee  needs  to  send  a  strong  signal  to  the  Appropria-
tions Committees about the importance we place on full funding of
NIST.  The  pace  of  technology  keeps  accelerating,  particularly  in
areas  such  as  biofuels,  pharmaceutical  biologics,  and  health  care
IT.  NIST  has  an  important  role  to  play  in  the  adoption  of  these
technologies  through  the  creation  of  standards  and  the  new  meas-
urement technologies.

And  let  me  speak  just  a  moment  on  this.  You  know,  NIST  is
probably  one  of  the  most  under-estimated  aspects  of  the  Federal
Government. It was originally meant to take care of measures and
standards.  Now  it  goes  much  beyond  that,  and  I  think  it  is  an
agency  that  all  of  us  can  feel  comfortable  with  because  this  is  not

49

a  regulatory  agency.  This  is  an  agency  that  brings  together  the
business  community  and  the  manufacturing  community,  to  work
out  problems  on  standards.  And  I  think  you  are  going  to  find  that
our  committee  here,  besides  the  Technology  and  Innovation  Sub-
committee,  is  going  to  get  a  lot  more  respect  within  Washington
and elsewhere because of this agency. We are where the Commerce
Committee has been stagnant in terms of health care IT. Ways and
Means  hasn’t  been  able  to  go  forward.  We  are  going  to  be  able  to
step  forward  and  solve  some  of  those  problems  where  the  health
care  community  is  going  to  look  at  the  Science  and  Technology
Committee  as  the  one  who  made  that  breakthrough.  Financial
services is going to look at us pretty soon as a committee that can
make  those  kind  of  breakthroughs  because  of  NIST.  So  we  are
going to continue working on that, and I think you are going to see
NIST help us to make our committee much more relevant.

The Committee is also aware of the important role that the Man-
ufacturing  Extension  Partnership,  MEP,  plays  in  keeping  good
manufacturing  jobs  here  in  the  United  States,  and  NIST  has  a
proven  track  record  of  implementing  its  technology  development
programs.

Finally,  the  last  two  measures  we  are  considering  today,
H.Con.Res.  95  and  H.Res.  316  recognize  the  outstanding  achieve-
ments  of  a  group  of  American  scientists.  It  is  important  that  Con-
gress recognize Americans who achieve great things in science, not
just for the satisfaction of individual scientists but to show the pub-
lic that Congress truly values the work that scientists do.

And  now  I  will  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  present  his  opening  state-

ment.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Good  Morning.  Pursuant  to  notice,  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology

meets to consider the following measures:

• H.R. 1867, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2007;
• H.R.  1868,  Technology  Innovation  and  Manufacturing  Stimulation  Act  of

2007;

• H.Con.Res. 95, Honoring the career and research accomplishments of Frances

E. Allen, the 2006 recipient of the A.M. Turing Award; and

• H.Res.  316,  Recognizing  the  accomplishments  of  Roger  D.  Kornberg,  Andrew
Fire,  Craig  Mello,  John  C.  Mather,  and  George  F.  Smoot  for  being  awarded
Nobel  Prizes  in  the  fields  of  chemistry,  physiology  or  medicine,  and  physics.
Today  the  Committee  is  meeting  to  markup  four  good  bipartisan  bills.  The  first
bill we will consider today is H.R. 1867, the National Science Foundation Authoriza-
tion  Act  of  2007.  H.R.  1867  was  introduced  by  Chairman  Baird,  Ranking  Member
Ehlers  and  other  Members  of  the  Research  and  Science  Education  Subcommittee.
The  Subcommittee  met  last  Wednesday  to  consider  H.R.  1867,  and  favorably  re-
ported the bill by voice vote after adopting three amendments. I want to thank and
congratulate  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  for  their  hard  work  and  bipartisan  co-
operation  on  this  excellent  bill.  The  core  of  this  bill  is  the  three-year  authorization
that keeps the Foundation on a 10-year doubling path.

NSF is a major source of federal backing for basic research at universities, across

all disciplines.

Members of the Science and Technology Committee often have a difficult time ex-
plaining  to  our  constituents  and  other  Members  of  Congress  why  it  is  so  important
to  fund  basic  research.  The  benefits  to  you  and  me  can  seem  so  intangible  in  com-
parison to many of the other things the Federal Government funds.

But  with  the  publicity  around  recent  reports  like  ‘‘Rising  Above  the  Gathering
Storm,’’  more  of  our  colleagues  and  constituents  understand  that  federally-funded
research  pays  enormous  dividends  to  society.  Economic  growth,  public  health,  na-
tional  defense,  and  social  advancement  have  all  been  tied  to  technological  develop-
ments resulting from basic research.

In  addition  to  providing  strong  research  budgets,  H.R.  1867  provides  important
funding for some critical STEM education programs, including three K–12 programs
that  this  committee  expanded  and  refined  in  H.R.  362,  which  I  am  happy  to  say
just passed the House yesterday.

The  education  programs  at  NSF  are  perhaps  more  tangible  to  the  typical  Amer-
ican,  as  everybody  wants  their  children  to  be  taught  by  highly  qualified  teachers
and  to  graduate  high  school  and  community  college  prepared  for  the  workforce  of
the  21st  Century,  or  to  have  the  opportunity  to  pursue  even  higher  degrees  if  they
so desire.

I am pleased that H.R. 1867 once again reaffirms the critical role that NSF plays
in  STEM  education.  This  is  a  good  bill.  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  it,  and  to
continue to work with me to ensure that the rest of our colleagues in Congress un-
derstand the value of basic research as we do.

Today,  we’ll  also  take  up  H.R.  1868,  the  Technology  Innovation  and  Manufac-
turing Stimulation Act of 2007. This is an authorization bill for the programs of the
National institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

This  bill  is  the  bipartisan  product  of  the  Technology  and  Innovation  Sub-
committee.  I  want  to  commend  Chairman  Wu  and  Ranking  Member  Gingrey  for
moving  this  bill  through  the  Subcommittee  expeditiously.  The  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Committee  needs  to  send  a  strong  signal  to  the  Appropriations  Committee
about the importance we place on full funding for NIST.

H.R. 1868 places the NIST budget on the path to doubling over the next 10 years.
The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  has  always  been  in  the  ‘‘amen  corner’’  for
fully funding all of NIST.

The pace of technology keeps accelerating—particularly in areas such as biofuels,
pharmaceutical biologics and health care IT. NIST has an important role to play in
the adoption of these technologies through the creation of standards and new meas-
urement technologies.

This committee is also aware of the important role that the Manufacturing Exten-
sion  Partnership  (MEP)  program  plays  in  keeping  good  manufacturing  jobs  here  in
the U.S. And NIST has a proven track record in implementing its technology devel-
opment  program.  H.R.  1868  does  an  excellent  job  of  balancing  and  funding  these
priorities and everyone on this committee should support this legislation.

Finally,  the  last  two  measures  we  are  considering  today,  H.Con.Res.  95  and
H.Res.  316,  recognize  the  outstanding  achievements  of  a  group  of  American  sci-
entists.

It  is  important  that  Congress  recognizes  Americans  who  achieve  great  things  in
the  sciences,  not  just  for  the  satisfaction  of  the  individual  scientists,  but  to  show
the public that the Congress truly values the work that scientists do.

I recognize Mr. Hall to present his opening remarks.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  chance  to  make
some  opening  remarks.  Of  course,  as  you  say,  we  are  considering
two  authorization  bills  relating  to  the  President’s  American  Com-
petitive  Initiative  and  two  resolutions  honoring  the  accomplish-
ments of some very eminent American scientists.

The  National  Science  Foundation  Authorization  Act  of  2007  au-
thorizes funding for NSF for the next three fiscal years. This meas-
ure  goes  a  long  way  in  keeping  with  the  President’s  ACI  plan  to
double the budget within ten years. In fact, it goes slightly beyond
that  to  incorporate  some  of  the  additions  to  education  programs
that the House passed just yesterday.

I appreciate the work of the Subcommittee Ranking Member, Mr.
Ehlers,  for  his  dedication  and  work  on  this  bill;  and  I  thank  the
Chairman  and  I  thank  Congressman  Baird  for  their  willingness  to
cooperate on making this really a truly bipartisan endeavor. I look
forward to our continuing working together to improve this legisla-
tion and pass it with broad support.

I  am  also  pleased  that  we  are  marking  up  H.R.  1868,  the  Tech-
nology  Innovation  and  Manufacturing  Stimulation  Act  of  2007.
H.R.  1868  supports  the  President’s  ACI  by  setting  the  NIST  lab
budget  on  a  path  to  double  by  fiscal  year  2017.  This  bill  ensures
that America’s small- and medium-sized manufacturers have access
to  the  latest  technologies  and  processes  by  authorizing  the  Manu-
facturing Extension Partnership Program.

Finally,  H.R.  1868  authorizes  the  Technology  Innovation  Pro-
gram  to  promote  the  swift  development  of  high-risk  research  into
marketable  technologies.  And  I  thank  Dr.  Ehlers  and  Dr.  Gingrey
for  their  extensive  input  into  developing  this  bill,  as  well  as  the
staff who dedicated considerable time in this endeavor. Also I want
to  thank  my  Democratic  colleagues  for  incorporating  these  impor-
tant priorities in this bipartisan legislation.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  also  pleased  this  committee  will  honor  six
esteemed  American  scientists  today.  H.Con.Res.  95  recognizes  the
first  woman  to  receive  the  prestigious  computer  science  A.M.
Turing Award, Frances Allen. H.Res. 316 honors the five American
scientists  who  received  Nobel  Prizes  in  2006,  Roger  Kornberg  for
chemistry,  Andrew  Fire  for  medicine,  Craig  Mello  for  Medicine,
John Mather for physics, and George Smoot for physics.

And  before  I  close,  I  want  to  point  out  that  the  NSF  and  NIST
bills  as  you  have  said,  Mr.  Chairman,  both  major  pieces  of  legisla-
tion,  were  developed  after  only  a  few  hearings  on  each  topic,  only
one in the case of NIST. These hearings were at the subcommittee
level, so only a few Members of the Committee were able to attend
the  hearings.  Also,  with  regard  to  the  NIST  bill,  there  was  never
a  hearing  on  the  New  Technology  Innovation  Program.  In  fact,
these two bills were put together so quickly we have yet to receive
all  the  witnesses’  response  and  questions—their  response  to  the
questions  for  the  record  submitted  by  Members  of  the  Committee.
So  Mr.  Chairman,  while  I  certainly  support  these  bills  in  their
current  form  and  once  I  have  received  all  of  the  witnesses’  re-
sponse,  I  or  some  other  Members  may  want  to  propose  further
amendments  to  these  bills  when  they  are  considered  on  the  House
Floor, and I know you will work with us on that.

With  that,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time,  and  I  thank  you
for  laying  out  a  good  bill  and  preparing  for  a  good  hearing.  I  yield
back.

way in keeping with the President’s ACI plan to double the budget within ten years.
In fact, it goes slightly beyond that to incorporate some of the additions to education
programs  that  the  House  passed  yesterday.  I  appreciate  the  work  of  the  Sub-
committee  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Ehlers,  for  his  dedication  and  work  on  this  bill
and thank the Chairman and Mr. Baird for their willingness to cooperate on making
this a bipartisan endeavor. I look forward to our continuing to work together to im-
prove this legislation and pass it with broad support.

I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation
and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. H.R. 1868 supports the President’s ACI
by  setting  NIST’s  lab  budget  on  a  path  to  double  the  budget  by  fiscal  year  2017.
The  bill  will  ensure  America’s  small-  and  medium-sized  manufacturers  have  access
to the latest technologies and processes by authorizing the Manufacturing Extension
Partnership Program. Finally, H.R. 1868 authorizes the Technology Innovation Pro-
gram  to  promote  the  swift  development  of  high-risk  research  into  marketable  tech-
nologies. I thank Dr. Ehlers and Dr. Gingrey for their extensive input in developing
this  bill  and  my  Democratic  colleagues  for  incorporating  our  priorities  into  this  bi-
partisan legislation.

I  also  am  pleased  the  Committee  will  honor  six  esteemed  American  scientists
today. H.Con.Res. 95 recognizes the first woman to receive the prestigious computer
science A.M. Turner award, Frances Allen. H.Res. 316 honors the five American sci-
entists  who  received  Nobel  prizes  in  2006:  Roger  Kornberg  for  chemistry;  Andrew
Fire  for  medicine;  Craig  Mello  for  medicine;  John  Mather  for  physics;  and  George
Smoot for physics.

Before I close, I want to point out that the NSF and NIST bills, both major pieces
of  legislation,  were  developed  after  only  one  hearing  on  each  topic.  Those  hearings
were at the Subcommittee level, so only a few Members of the Committee were able
to  attend  the  hearings.  In  the  case  of  the  NIST  bill  there  was  never  a  hearing  on
the  new  Technology  Innovation  Program.  In  fact,  these  two  bills  were  put  together
so  quickly  that  we  have  yet  to  receive  all  of  the  witnesses’  responses  to  questions
for  the  record  submitted  by  Members  of  this  committee.  Therefore,  Mr.  Chairman,
while I support these bills in their current form, once I have reviewed all of the wit-
nesses responses I, or other Members, may want to propose further amendments to
these bills when they are considered on the House Floor.

With that I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall. Let me assure you that
we want to continue to work in the spirit that we have to get good
bills.  You  know,  the  last  NIST  authorization  was  in  1992  out  of
this  committee.  It  has  been  five  years  since  we  had  a  National
Science Foundation authorization. There have been lots of hearings
in  between,  but  you  know,  it  is  time  to  get  something  done;  and
we  want  to  have  the  best  bill  possible,  and  you  can  be  absolutely
assured that we will continue with that collaboration.

Without  objection,  Members  may  place  statements  in  the  record

at this point.

We  will  now  consider  H.Con.Res.  316,  Recognizing  the  accom-
plishments  of  Roger  D.  Kornberg,  Andrew  Fire,  Craig  Mello,  John
C. Mather, and George F. Smoot for being awarded the Nobel Prize
in the fields of chemistry, physiology or medicine, and physics.

Mr. McNerney is not here right now but let me say I very much
appreciate the attendance here at the end. Oh, and here he is. We
were going to proceed anyway because you were so good to stay but
since Mr. McNerney is here, I would recognize him for opening re-
marks.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  allowing  that
dramatic  entrance.  And  I  also  thank  Ranking  Member  Hall  for
your  support  in  this  resolution  for  working  quickly  to  ensure  that
we  recognize  a  deserving  group  of  scientists  on  their  important
achievements.  I  especially  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  describe
this  legislation  that  highlights  the  contributions  of  American  sci-
entists.

H.Res.  316  is  a  scientific  work  not  only  because  it  applauds  the
breakthrough of scientific work but the bill also draws attention to
many  of  the  issues  we  frequently  work  on  in  the  Committee,  put-
ting  a  spotlight  on  scientific  discovery  as  a  way  to  inspire  a  new
generation  to  become  involved  in  fields  that  they  might  otherwise
ignore.

For  the  first  time  in  over  20  years  U.S.  researchers  have  swept
the  scientific  categories  of  the  Nobel  Prize  by  winning  awards  for
chemistry, physiology or medicine, and physics. It is fitting that we
recognize  the  contributions  of  these  individuals,  and  I  am  proud
that we are doing so here today.

In  December  of  last  year,  the  Nobel  Prize  in  chemistry  was
awarded  to  Roger  Kornberg  from  Stanford  University  in  my  home
State  of  California,  the  physiology  prize  went  to  Andrew  Fire  who
works  also  at  Stanford  in  the  school  of  medicine,  and  the  physics
award  went  to  John  Mather  from  NASA’s  Goddard  Space  Center
and to George Smoot from the University of California at Berkeley.
Mr.  Smoot  has  also  the  timely  distinction  of  adding  his  name  to
the  list  of  more  than  170  National  Science  Foundation  grantees
who were awarded the Nobel Prizes over the years. I am sure that
with the improvements we have just made to programs at NSF and
the  dedication  that  we  all  have  to  moving  this  country  forward,
Professor  Smoot  will  certainly  not  be  the  last  Nobel  Prize  winner
to benefit from NSF funding.

H.Res. 316 officially recognizes the accomplishments of these sci-

entists and their contributions to improving society.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  can’t  think  of  a  better  way  to  honor  these  indi-
viduals  and  commend  them  for  helping  the  United  States  sweep
science  Nobel  Prizes  for  the  first  time  in  33  years.  As  I  look  out
here,  I  see  a  number  of  young  scientists  and  implore  you  to  con-
tinue your work. We will do our work here in the Committee to see
that you get the money you need and the recognition, and you need
to work as hard as you can to fulfill your visions and your dreams
of making new awards and new discoveries in science.

I thank you and I yield back the back of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. McNerney follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY MCNERNEY

Thank you Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, Ranking Member Hall, for your support of this resolution and for
working quickly to ensure that we recognize a very deserving group of scientists on
their important achievements.

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  describe  this  legislation  that  highlights  the  con-

tributions of American scientists.

H.Res.  316  is  significant,  not  only  because  it  applauds  breakthrough  scientific
work,  but  the  bill  also  draws  attention  to  many  of  the  issues  we  frequently  work
on  in  this  committee;  putting  the  spotlight  on  scientific  discovery  as  a  way  to  get
young people interested in fields they might otherwise ignore.

For the first time in more than 20 years, U.S. researchers swept the scientific cat-
egories of the Nobel Prize by winning the awards for chemistry, physiology or medi-
cine, and physics.

It  is  fitting  that  we  recognize  the  contributions  of  these  individuals,  and  I’m

pleased that we’re doing so here today.

In  December  of  last  year  the  Nobel  Prize  in  Chemistry  was  awarded  to  Roger
Kornberg  from  Stanford  University  in  my  State  of  California;  the  physiology  prize
went  to  Andrew  Fire,  who  also  works  at  Stanford—in  the  School  of  Medicine—and
the  physics  award  went  to  John  Mather  from  NASA’s  Goddard  Space  Center  and
to George Smoot from the University of California at Berkeley.

Mr.  Smoot  also  has  the  timely  distinction  of  adding  his  name  to  the  list  of  more

than 170 NSF grantees who were awarded Nobel Prizes over the years.

I’m  sure  that  with  the  improvements  we’ve  just  made  to  the  programs  at  NSF,
and the dedication that we all have to moving this country forward, Professor Smoot
will certainly not be the last Nobel winner to benefit from NSF funding.

H.Res.  316  officially  recognizes  the  accomplishments  of  these  scientists  and  their

contributions to improving society.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  can’t  think  of  a  better  way  to  honor  these  individuals  and  com-
mend  them  for  helping  the  U.S.  sweep  the  science  Nobel  Prizes  for  the  first  time
in 33 years.

Thank you, and I yield my time.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you  for  those  remarks,  and  I  will  re-
mind  everyone  that  these  are  not  only  significant  awards  for  indi-
viduals,  but  this  is  really  an  award  for  America  that  we  would
sweep these and that these Nobel Prize winners will be honored at
a luncheon next week here in the Science Committee Room; and we
welcome everyone to join.

And  I  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  present  any  remarks  on  the  resolu-

tion.

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  pleased  to  support
the  resolution.  I  would  like  to  add  that  these  men  are  true  testa-
ments to the spirit of American innovation. In an increasingly com-
petitive  world,  it  is  impressive  that  our  Nation  continues  to
produce  world-class  scholars  such  as  these  men.  It  really  doesn’t
surprise  me  that  the  Nation  that  invented  the  light  bulb  and  put
a  man  on  the  Moon  fosters  such  innovative  solutions  to  the  most
pressing  challenges.  It  is  my  hope  that  our  innovation  agenda  will
continue  to  provide  a  foundation  from  which  scholars  and  entre-
preneurs  can  launch  their  ideas  into  the  competitive  marketplace
as these men have done. I yield back.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall,  and  I  think  our  NSF
authorization  and  our  NIST  authorization  today  will  help  accom-
plish what you had suggested.

Does anyone else wish to be recognized? Dr. Baird.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Mr.  Chairman,  very  briefly,  during  our  debate  on
H.R.  362  and  363,  I  observed  that  we  need  to  embody—we  spoke
about  the  need  to  improve  respect  for  science  and  math  education
nationwide,  and  I  suggest  that  we  need  to  embody  that  with  the
Congress, and I observe that we tend to offer more resolutions con-
gratulating  athletic  teams  or  movie  stars  than  we  do  honoring
sciences;  and  I  very  much  commend  Mr.  McNerney  for  reversing
that  trend  and  it  is  richly  deserved  that  we  honor  and  that  the
Congress  really  embody  the  principle  of  honoring  these  scientists
with this resolution. I commend him for it and thank him for offer-
ing this resolution.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you. And once again, we invite every-

one to come meet them next week.

Is  there  anyone  else  that  would  like  to  speak  to  this  resolution?
If  not,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  resolution  is  considered
as  read  and  open  to  amendment  at  any  point  and  that  Members
proceed with amendments in the order of the roster. Without objec-
tion, so ordered.

Are there any amendments? Hearing none, the vote is on the res-
olution,  H.  Res.  316.  All  those  in  favor  say  aye,  all  those  opposed
say no. In opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.

I recognize Mr. Hall to offer a motion.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Committee  favorably
report  House  Resolution  316  to  the  House  with  the  recommenda-
tion  that  the  bill  do  pass.  Furthermore,  I  move  that  staff  be  in-
structed  to  make  necessary  technical  and  conforming  changes  and
that the Chairman take all the necessary steps to bring the resolu-
tion before the House for consideration. I yield back my time.

Chairman  GORDON.  The  question  is  on  the  motion  to  report  the
resolution  favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by
saying aye, opposed no. The ayes have it. The resolution is reported
favorably.  Without  objection  the  motion  to  reconsider  is  laid  upon
the table. I move the Members have two subsequent calendar days
in  which  to  submit  supplemental  minority  or  additional  views  on
the  measure.  I  move  pursuant  to  Clause  1  of  Rule  22  of  the  Rules
of  the  House  of  Representatives  that  the  Committee  authorize  the
Chairman to offer such motions as may be necessary in the House
to  adopt  and  pass  H.Res.  316,  Recognizing  the  accomplishments  of
Dr. Roger D. Kornberg, Andrew Fire, Craig Mello, John C. Mather,
and  George  F.  Smoot  for  being  awarded  the  Nobel  Prizes  in  the
fields  of  chemistry,  physiology  or  medicine,  and  physics.  Without
objection, so ordered.

And finally, let me look at all of you say thank you for being the
hard  core  and  staying  here  as  we  completed  our  business.  We  had
four  good  resolutions  today,  and  I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  again;
and this meeting is concluded.

[Whereupon, at 11:28 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

I. AMENDMENT

The amendment is as follows:
Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:

(1)  The  United  States  faces  a  range  of  energy  challenges  that  affect  our
economy,  security,  and  environment.  Fundamentally,  these  challenges  involve
science and technology.

(2)  The  Department  of  Energy  already  has  some  of  the  mechanisms  nec-
essary  to  promote  long-term  research,  but  it  lacks  the  mechanisms  for  quickly
transforming the results into technology that meets national needs.

(3) A recent report of the Secretary of Energy’s Advisory Board’s Task Force
on the Future of Science Programs at the Department of Energy concluded that
America  can  meet  its  energy  needs  only  if  we  make  a  strong  and  sustained  in-
vestment  in  research  in  physical  science,  engineering,  and  applicable  life
sciences and if we translate advancing scientific knowledge into practice.’’

(4) The Department of Defense, since 1958, has used its Defense Advanced
Projects  Research  Agency  (DARPA)  for  aggressively  addressing  real-time  de-
fense  problems  through  targeted  programs  of  research  and  technology  develop-
ment  that  have  improved  our  national  defense  through  transformational  tech-
nologies.

(5)  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences’  report  entitled  ‘‘Rising  Above  the
Gathering  Storm:  Energizing  and  Employing  America  for  a  Brighter  Economic
Future’’  recommends  creating  a  new  agency  within  the  Department  of  Energy
to sponsor ‘‘creative, out-of-the-box, transformational, generic energy research in
those areas where industry by itself cannot or will not undertake such sponsor-
ship, where risks and payoffs are high.’’ Such an organization would be able to
accelerate  the  process  by  which  research  is  transformed  to  address  energy-re-
lated  economic,  environmental,  and  security  issues  to  decrease  dependence  on
foreign energy through targeted research and technology development.

SEC. 2. ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY-ENERGY.

(a)  ESTABLISHMENT.—There  is  established  the  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency–Energy (in this Act referred to as ‘‘ARPA–E’’) within the Department of En-
ergy.

(b)  GOALS.—The  goals  of  ARPA–E  are  to  enhance  the  Nation’s  economic  and
energy security through reductions in imports of energy from foreign sources, to re-
duce  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  from  the  energy  and  industrial  sectors,  to  im-
prove energy efficiency of all economic sectors, and to ensure that the United States
maintains  a  technological  lead  in  developing  and  deploying  energy  technologies.
ARPA–E will achieve this by—

(1)  identifying  and  promoting  revolutionary  advances  in  fundamental

sciences with potential energy and environmental applications;

(2)  translating  scientific  discoveries  and  cutting-edge  engineering  innova-
tions  into  technologies  that  promote  energy  security  and  sound  environmental
stewardship; and

(3)  accelerating  the  market  adoption  of  transformational  technological  ad-
vances in areas such as alternative fuels and transportation technology, energy
efficiency,  electricity  production  and  infrastructure,  and  carbon  capture  and  se-
questration.
(c) DIRECTOR.—ARPA–E shall be headed by a Director who shall be appointed
by the Secretary of Energy. The Director shall report to the Secretary. No other pro-
grams within the Department of Energy shall report to the Director of ARPA–E.

(d)  RESPONSIBILITIES.—The  Director  shall  administer  the  Fund  established
under  section  3  to  award  competitive  grants,  cooperative  agreements,  or  contracts
to  institutions  of  higher  education,  companies,  research  foundations,  trade  and  in-
dustry research collaborations, or consortia of such entities which may include feder-
ally  funded  research  and  development  centers,  to  achieve  the  goals  stated  in  sub-
section (b) through targeted acceleration of—

(1)  novel  early-stage  energy  research  with  possible  technology  applications;
(2) development of techniques, processes, and technologies, and related test-

ing and evaluation;

(3) development of manufacturing processes for technologies; and

(4) demonstration and coordination with non-governmental entities for com-

mercial applications of technologies and research applications.
(e) PERSONNEL.—

(1)  PROGRAM  MANAGERS.—The  Director  shall  designate  employees  to
serve  as  program  managers  for  each  of  the  programs  established  pursuant  to
the responsibilities established for ARPA–E under subsection (d). Program man-
agers shall be responsible for—

(A)  establishing  research  and  development  goals  for  the  program,  in-
cluding through the convening of workshops and conferring with outside ex-
perts as well as publicizing its goals to the public and private sectors;

(B) soliciting applications for specific areas of particular promise, espe-
cially  those  which  the  private  sector  alone  cannot  or  will  not  provide  fund-
ing;

(C) building research collaborations for carrying out the program;
(D)  selecting  on  the  basis  of  merit,  with  advice  under  section  4  as  ap-
propriate, each of the projects to be supported under the program following
consideration of—

(i)  the  novelty  and  scientific  and  technical  merit  of  the  proposed

projects;

(ii)  the  demonstrated  capabilities  of  the  applicants  to  successfully

carry out the proposed research project;

(iii) the applicant’s consideration of future commercial applications
of the project, including the feasibility of partnering with a commercial
entity  or  entities  to  help  increase  the  chances  of  market  penetration;

(iv) such other criteria as are established by the Director; and

(E)  monitoring  the  progress  of  projects  supported  under  the  program,
and  prescribing  program  restructure  or  termination  of  research  partner
ships or whole projects that do not show promise.
(2)  HIRING  AND  MANAGEMENT.—In  hiring  personnel  for  ARPA–E,  the
Secretary  shall  have  the  hiring  and  management  authorities  described  in  sec-
tion 1101 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 1999 (5 U.S.C. 3104 note). For purposes of subsection (c)(1) of that section,
the  term  of  appointments  for  employees  may  not  exceed  three  years  before  the
granting  of  any  extension.  In  hiring  initial  staff  the  Secretary  shall  give  pref-
erence to applicants with experience in the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency,  academia,  or  private  sector  technology  development.  The  Secretary  or
Director may contract with private recruiting firms in hiring qualified technical
staff.

(3) ADDITIONAL HIRING.—The Director may hire additional technical, fi-
nancial,  managerial,  or  other  staff  as  needed  to  carry  out  the  activities  of  the
program.
(f)  COORDINATION  AND  NON–DUPLICATION.—To  the  extent  practicable,
the Director shall ensure that the activities of ARPA–E are coordinate with, and do
not  duplicate  the  efforts  of,  existing  programs  and  laboratories  within  the  Depart-
ment of Energy and other relevant research agencies. Where appropriate, the Direc-
tor may coordinate technology transfer efforts with the Technology Transfer Coordi-
nator established in section 1001 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16391).
(g)  FEDERAL  USE  of  TECHNOLOGIES.—The  Secretary  shall  seek  opportuni-
ties  to  utilize  federal  agencies’  purchasing  and  procurement  programs  to  dem-
onstrate technologies resulting from activities funded through ARPA–E and to facili-
tate their entry into private markets.
SEC. 3. FUND.

(a)  ESTABLISHMENT.—There  is  established  in  the  Treasury  the  Energy
Transformation  Acceleration  Fund  (in  this  Act  referred  to  as  the  ‘‘Fund’’),  which
shall  be  administered  by  the  Director  of  ARPA–E  for  the  purposes  of  carrying  out
this Act.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be ap-
propriated to the Director of ARPA–E for deposit in the Fund $300,000,000 for fiscal

uation shall be made available to Congress and to the public upon completion.
SEC. 6. SAVINGS CLAUSE.

The authorities granted by this Act are in addition to existing authorities grant-
ed to the Secretary of Energy, and not intended to supersede or modify any existing
authorities.

II. PURPOSE OF THE BILL

The  purpose  of  the  bill  is  to  establish  within  the  Department  of
Energy,  the  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency–Energy  (ARPA–
E), and set up an Energy Transformation Acceleration Fund to con-
duct activities under the Act.

III. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE LEGISLATION

H.R.  364  follows  a  recommendation  of  the  National  Academies
2005  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  also  known  as  the
‘‘Augustine  Report’’  for  its  Chair,  retired  Lockheed  Martin  CEO
Norman  Augustine.  In  addition  to  a  wide  range  of  recommenda-
tions for boosting the global competitiveness of the U.S. technology
sector,  this  report  called  on  the  Federal  Government  to  create  a
new energy research agency within the Department of Energy pat-
terned  loosely  on  the  successful  Defense  Advanced  Research
Projects  Agency  (DARPA)  within  the  Department  of  Defense.  Ac-
cording  to  the  Gathering  Storm  report,  ARPA–E  should  be  struc-
tured to ‘‘sponsor creative, out-of-the-box, transformational, generic
energy research in those areas where industry itself cannot or will
not undertake such sponsorships, where risks and potential payoffs

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

65

are high, and where success could provide dramatic benefits for the
Nation. ARPA–E would accelerate the process by which research is
transformed  to  address  economic,  environmental,  and  security
issues.  It  would  be  designed  as  a  lean,  effective,  and  agile—but
largely independent—organization that can start and stop targeted
programs  based  on  performance  and  ultimate  relevance.’’  In  addi-
tion  to  H.R.  364,  a  number  of  bills  establishing  an  ARPA–E  were
introduced in both the 109th and 110th Congress in both the House
and Senate (including S. 696, the Energy Research Act of 2007, and
S. 761, the Senate COMPETES Act).

Despite the growing focus on energy challenges, R&D investment
in  energy  remains  far  below  the  historically  high  levels  of  the
1970’s. A GAO report commissioned by Chairman Gordon and Con-
gressman  Honda  noted  that  ‘‘DOE’s  total  budget  authority  for  en-
ergy R&D dropped by over 85 percent (in real terms) from 1978 to
2005, peaking in the late 1970’s but falling sharply when oil prices
returned  to  lower  levels  in  the  mid-1980’s.’’  (GAO–07–106)  Wit-
nesses  at  the  April  26  Subcommittee  hearing  all  agreed  that  for
ARPA–E to be successful, the program must be funded at levels to
match the magnitude and complexity of energy challenges, and the
high  costs  of  energy  research  and  technology  demonstration.  Ac-
cording  to  venture  capitalist  and  Subcommittee  witness  John
Denniston:

‘‘...  federal  spending  on  renewable  energy  research  amounts  to
little more than $1 billion per year. Frankly, this is inadequate
relative  to  the  scope  of  our  problems,  and  the  sheer  size  of  the
energy and transportation industries which amount to over $1.8
trillion annually. We are way off scale.’’

It  was  suggested  in  the  hearing  that  no  other  technology-based
industry  has  such  a  small  proportion  of  revenues  invested  in  re-
search,  either  through  private  or  government  resources.  It  was
pointed out in the hearing that the National Institute of Health re-
ceives $28 billion for research annually, and DARPA itself was ini-
tially  budgeted  for  the  equivalent  of  $3.5  billion,  and  remains  at
roughly the same level today.

IV. COMMITTEE VIEWS

The  primary  motivations  of  the  Committee  for  establishing  an
ARPA–E  are  the  need  for  the  U.S.  to  obtain  more  energy  from  do-
mestic sources, become more energy efficient, and become less reli-
ant on energy sources and technologies that have an adverse effect
on the environment. The push for new energy technologies is espe-
cially  urgent  given  the  geopolitical  forces  that  threaten  global  en-
ergy  supplies  and  economic  stability,  the  rising  costs  of  energy  to
consumers,  the  looming  threat  of  global  climate  change,  and  prob-
able regulation of carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to address-
ing the Nation’s energy challenges, the Gathering Storm report also
concluded  that  ARPA–E  will  contribute  to  U.S.  competitiveness  by
playing  an  important  role  in  ‘‘advancing  research  in  engineering,
the physical sciences, and mathematics; and in developing the next
generation of researchers.’’ While isolated elements in the national
labs,  industry,  and  academia  have  collaborated  with  varying  de-
grees of success, there is currently no federal program charged with

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

66

bringing  these  elements  together.  Such  an  effort  would  result  in  a
stronger  and  more  diverse  domestic  community  of  researchers  and
technology  developers  focused  on  pushing  transformational  energy
solutions  into  the  marketplace.  ARPA–E  is  intended  to  play  this
critical role.

To  pursue  truly 

innovative  and  transformational  research
ARPA–E  will  utilize  an  organizational  structure  and  approach
projects  in  a  way  that  is  fundamentally  different  from  that  of  the
traditional energy research enterprise. Critics of the Department of
Energy’s management of research programs contend that the stove-
piped  structure  and  bureaucratic  culture  of  DOE  is  not  conducive
to the rapid development of cross-cutting energy solutions, or trans-
lating  basic  research  discoveries  into  technology  applications  for
the  marketplace.  Potentially  revolutionary  research  may  be  too
risky  or  multi-disciplinary  to  fit  into  a  specific  program’s  mission
at  DOE,  and  the  peer  review  system  tends  to  favor  established  in-
vestigators  pursuing  incremental  advances  in  well-understood  con-
cepts. On the contrary ARPA–E will be driven by its mission, mini-
mizing  interaction  with  the  DOE  bureaucracy.  It  should  be  a  rel-
atively  flat  and  nimble  organization,  similar  to  the  small,  flexible,
non-hierarchical  reporting  structure  that  supported  a  unique  and
highly successful culture of innovation at DARPA.

ARPA–E  will  also  have  autonomy  within  DOE  similar  to  that  of
DARPA  within  DOD.  Because  the  director  of  ARPA–E  reports  di-
rectly  to  the  Secretary  of  Energy,  and  no  other  programs  report  to
ARPA–E,  it  does  not  add  another  layer  to  the  DOE  bureaucracy.
This also ensures that ARPA–E has a unique independence within
DOE,  it  is  not  beholden  to  any  one  particular  technology  area  or
research  program  within  DOE.  To  address  concerns  about  political
pressures  to  direct  ARPA–E  funding,  language  was  added  to  fur-
ther  ensure  that  all  projects  funded  by  ARPA–E  will  be  evaluated
on  the  basis  of  merit.  Bureaucratic  and  political  meddling  are  the
main impediments ARPA–E is designed to avoid.

ARPA–E’s  unique  function  is  best  described  as  that  of  a  ‘‘mar-
riage  broker’’  that  can  identify  people  and  capabilities  within  in-
dustry, universities, and the national labs, and assemble hybrid re-
search  teams  to  quickly  develop  novel  solutions  to  pressing  energy
problems.  Key  to  this  function  is  the  Program  Manager.  As  in
DARPA,  Program  Managers  for  ARPA–E  should  be  exceptionally
talented,  creative  and  knowledgeable,  experienced  in  industry  or
academia,  and  passionate  in  pursuit  of  their  objectives.  Because  of
the  flexible  hiring  authority  that  is  written  into  Section  2  of  the
bill, talented Program Managers can be recruited from a variety of
fields,  hired  for  a  term  of  approximately  three  years,  and  paid  a
salary  commensurate  with  what  they  would  make  in  the  private
sector.  To  allow  ARPA–E  to  pursue  truly  novel  technology  areas,
projects  will  not  undergo  the  traditional  peer-review  process.  In-
stead,  Program  Managers  and  their  superiors  are  given  extraor-
dinary  autonomy  and  resources  to  pursue  unique  technology  path-
ways  at  will,  to  assemble  quickly  teams  of  researchers  and  tech-
nology  developers,  and  to  just  as  quickly  change  course  or  termi-
nate  research  projects  that  do  not  look  fruitful.  This  is  different
from  the  current  DOE  model  which  is  criticized  for  requiring  inor-
dinate  amounts  of  time  to  start  up  research  projects,  not  looking

broadly enough for research participants, and then sustaining sup-
port for projects and people beyond a timeframe where meaningful
results are likely.

ARPA–E is expected to pursue a ‘‘whatever it takes’’ approach to
moving potentially transformational research and technologies from
the  labs  to  the  marketplace.  With  adequate  funding  and  authority
ARPA–E will leverage its resources and institutional capabilities to
engage in activities across the entire innovation spectrum. This in-
cludes  anything  from  early-stage  basic  research  into  fundamental
concepts  with  possible  technology  applications,  to  later-stage  tech-
nology  prototyping,  large-scale  demonstrations  and  commercial  ap-
plications.

Investment in ARPA–E should be seen in the context of increas-
ing  overall  energy  R&D  expenditures  enough  to  address  the  scope
and  complexity  of  the  challenges.  It  is  not  intended  for  funding  of
ARPA–E  to  come  at  the  expense  of  other  research  accounts  within
DOE, especially the basic research of the Office of Science, and lan-
guage  was  added  in  the  Full  Committee  markup  to  further  clarify
that.  The  Gathering  Storm  report  calls  for  ARPA–E  to  be  author-
ized at $300 million in the first year, and quickly escalate to $1 bil-
lion  within  five  years.  Responding  to  concerns  on  the  part  of  the
witnesses  and  other  outside  stakeholders,  the  Committee  chose  to
pursue a more aggressive funding profile that matches the scale of
the challenge, the costs of energy research, and the likelihood that
ARPA–E  funding  would  not  continue  to  grow  gradually  over  time.
Initial funding for ARPA–E in H.R. 364 is set at $300 million, and
increases  to  $1  billion  in  the  second  year  to  allow  ARPA–E  to  be
fully  operational  more  quickly.  Though  no  provision  was  included
to  address  this,  the  hearing  witnesses  and  others  have  suggested
that a high-cost, risk-tolerant program like ARPA–E would be most
effective  if  it  has  a  dedicated  stream  of  funding,  and  would  there-
fore  not  be  subject  to  annual  political  and  financial  pressures  and
fluctuations  that  stifle  innovation  today.  Future  Administrations
and Congresses should consider a range of mechanisms that ensure
steady and reliable funding for ARPA–E.

VII. SUMMARY OF MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BILL

H.R.  364  authorizes  $4.9  billion  for  ARPA–E  for  the  fiscal  years
2008–2012,  with  initial  year  funding  contingent  on  an  increase  in
the DOE Office of Science. The bill also outlines the organizational
structure,  hiring  practices,  goals,  and  activities  of  ARPA–E.  The
bill specifies that, to the extent practicable, ARPA–E will not dupli-
cate the specific efforts of other research programs, will coordinate
with  those  programs  wherever  possible,  and  seek  opportunities  to
demonstrate  technologies  within  the  Federal  Government.  Specific
guidelines are set for the proportion of funds that may be used for
overhead expenses, late-stage demonstration and commercial appli-
cations,  federally  funded  research  and  development  centers,  new
construction, and technology transfer and outreach activities. After
roughly  five  years  of  operations  ARPA–E  will  be  evaluated  by  the
President’s Committee on Science and Technology.
VIII. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 1. Findings

The  U.S.  should  address  long-term  energy  challenges  through  sustained  invest-
ment in energy research programs at DOE augmented by an innovative and aggres-
sive  new  energy  technology  development  effort  based  on  the  same  operating  prin-
ciples that make DARPA successful.
Section 2. Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy

This  section  establishes  the  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency–Energy  (ARPA–
E)  within  the  Department  of  Energy.  Similar  to  the  Department  of  Defense’s  Ad-
vanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA),  this  new  organizational  structure  will
support revolutionary and transformational energy research where risk and payoffs
are high.

The stated goal of ARPA–E is to enhance the Nation’s economic and energy secu-
rity through research and development of technologies that reduce U.S. dependence
on foreign energy sources, improve energy efficiency of the U.S. economy, reduce the
impact  of  the  energy  sector  on  the  environment,  and  ensure  the  U.S.  leadership  in
developing  energy  technologies.  To  achieve  this  ARPA–E  will  support  collaborative,
targeted, high-risk, high payoff research to accelerate the innovation cycle for trans-
formational energy technologies.

ARPA–E shall be headed by a Director, appointed by the Secretary. No other pro-
gram  within  DOE  will  report  to  ARPA–E.  The  Director  will  administer  competitive
grants,  cooperative  agreements,  or  contracts  to  universities,  private  companies,  re-
search  foundations,  industry  collaborations,  and  consortia.  These  consortia  can  in-

71

clude federal laboratories, in addition to the aforementioned parties, and can be led
by federal laboratories. Funds may be used for activities in any stage of the innova-
tion spectrum from early-stage basic research to late-stage demonstration. A special
emphasis  should  be  placed  on  activities  that  serve  to  bridge  between  these  stages
and,  ultimately,  across  the  ‘‘valley  of  death’’  to  commercial  applications  of  the  tech-
nologies.

The  organizational  structure  of  ARPA–E  should  be  flat  and  nimble  to  avoid  bu-
reaucratic  impediments  that  stifle  innovation  today.  The  Director  shall  designate
Program  Managers  who  will  have  flexibility  in  establishing  R&D  goals  for  the  pro-
gram,  publicizing  goals,  convening  workshops  of  potential  research  participants,
issuing  solicitations,  selecting  projects  and  building  research  teams,  monitoring
their  progress,  and  prescribing  restructuring  or  elimination  of  projects  as  needed.
Program  managers  will  make  selections  for  all  projects  under  ARPA–E  based  on
merit, taking into account factors such as novelty, scientific and technical merit, ap-
plicant’s capabilities, the applicant’s consideration of commercial applications of the
research and inclusion of commercial partner, and other criteria as the Director de-
termines.  As  with  DARPA,  the  Director  of  ARPA–E  will  have  special  authority  to
hire program managers and other technical, managerial, and financial staff for lim-
ited  terms,  and  at  a  salary  commensurate  with  what  such  staff  would  expect  to
make  in  the  private  sector.  In  finding  and  attracting  qualified  and  specialized  staff
the Director may contract with outside recruiting firms.

In  addition,  the  Director  shall  ensure  that  ARPA–E’s  activities  do  not  duplicate
and  are  coordinated  with  other  federal  research  and  technology  transfer  programs,
and  shall  seek  opportunities  to  demonstrate  ARPA–E  research  and  technologies
through procurement in the Federal Government.
Section. 3. Fund

This  section  establishes  the  Energy  Transformation  Acceleration  Fund  adminis-
tered  by  the  Director  of  ARPA–E.  $4.9  billion  is  authorized  for  FY  2008  through
2012,  to  remain  available  until  expended.  Funding  for  the  initial  year  of  ARPA–E
operations shall not be available unless the DOE Office of Science funding increases
from the previous year (2007).

This  section  also  lays  out  general  guidelines  for  how  money  should  be  allocated
in  a  given  fiscal  year.  Not  more  than  50  percent  of  funds  allocated  shall  be  for  ex-
pensive  late-stage  demonstrations  and  commercial  applications  of  technologies  and
research.  Not  more  than  eight  percent  of  funds  are  to  be  made  available  directly
to  Federally  Funded  Research  and  Development  Centers  (FFRDCs).  However,
FFRDCs  can  receive,  in  addition  to  the  eight  percent,  payment  for  services  from
ARPA–E grantees, contractors, cooperative agreement participants regardless of the
source of funds. Not more than 10 percent of funds shall be used for administrative
expenses. To ensure a robust technology transfer and outreach activities, 2.5 percent
of funds shall be dedicated to these activities. To ensure ARPA–E funds go towards
funding research within the Nation’s existing private and public research infrastruc-
ture, for the first five years, no funds should be used for construction of new build-
ings or facilities.
Section 4. Advice

The Director of ARPA–E has the flexibility to seek advice either from an existing
DOE  advisory  committee,  or  to  establish  a  new  advisory  committee.  The  Director
may also seek advice and review from the National Academies of Science and Engi-
neering, and any other professional or scientific organization.
Section 5. ARPA–E Evaluation

At  the  end  of  five  and  one-half  years,  the  President’s  Committee  on  Science  and
Technology (PCAST) shall complete an evaluation of the performance of ARPA–E in
achieving  its  goals  and  mission,  to  be  made  available  to  Congress  and  the  public.
In  this  evaluation  the  Committee  is  required  to  recommend  whether  ARPA–E
should be continued or terminated as well as provide lessons-learned from its oper-
ation.
Section 6. Savings Clause

This  clarifies  that  authorities  granted  by  this  Act  are  in  addition  to,  and  do  not

supersede or modify, existing authorities of the Secretary of Energy.

IX. DISSENTING VIEWS

DISSENTING VIEWS OF REPRESENTATIVES RALPH M.  HALL,  JUDY BIGGERT,
JO BONNER,  TOM FEENEY,  RANDY NEUGEBAUER,  MICHAEL T.  MCCAUL,
MARIO DIAZ–BALART,  PHIL GINGREY,  BRIAN BILBRAY AND ADRIAN SMITH
We  oppose  H.R.  364,  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of  the  Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency–Energy. The bill would create an
unnecessary  bureaucracy  at  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  that
the  agency  does  not  want  and  does  not  support.  Furthermore,  we
are  concerned  with  authorizing  $4.9  billion  for  a  new  agency  that
is likely to compete with existing programs for increasingly limited
federal  dollars.  It  poses  a  direct  threat  to  DOE’s  Office  of  Science,
which  was  singled  out  to  receive  priority  funding  in  the  October
2005 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report, Rising Above the
Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Bright-
er Economic Future, on which the bill is said to be based.

We see the potential benefit that ‘‘creative, out-of-the-box, trans-
formational’’  research  could  provide  to  our  country.  However,  we
have  yet  to  be  convinced  that  the  DOE,  as  currently  structured,
cannot  support,  and  does  not  already  support,  such  research.  For
example,  some  Members  of  the  Committee  believe  that  the  DOE’s
FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Initiatives, FutureGen, the Global Nu-
clear  Energy  Partnership,  and  U.S.  participation  in  ITER,  the
international  fusion  experiment,  already  qualify  as  ‘‘creative,  out-
of-the-box, transformational’’ research.

.

While the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Defense Advanced Re-
search  Project  Agency  (DARPA)  has  proven  to  be  largely  a  success
at  DOD,  differences  in  the  structure  and  culture  of  the  DOD  and
DOE should not be ignored. Just because something works at DOD,
does not mean it will work at DOE. A case in point is the creation
of  the  Homeland  Security  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency.  Ac-
cording  to  the  testimony  of  William  Bonvillian,  ‘‘While  the  Com-
mittee provided HS–ARPA with a strong and flexible authorization
closely  modeled  on  DARPA’s  strengths,  HS–ARPA  has  never  been
adequately  utilized  or  implemented.
..  An  innovation  culture  is
critical to success, and legislation alone can’t create this unless the
implementing agency shows real leadership, supports the new R&D
mission,  and  is  determined  to  use  flexible  statutory  authorities  to
create  a  strong  entity.’’  The  lack  of  support  by  the  current  Sec-
retary and Administration suggests that, in the face of such opposi-
tion, ARPA–E would likely fail.

We  would  also  point  out  that  the  bill  strays  from  the  Rising
Above  the  Gathering  Storm  report’s  ARPA–E  recommendation
which  states  that  ARPA–E  should  report  to  the  Under  Secretary
for  Science.  Instead,  the  bill  explicitly  states,  ‘‘The  Director  shall
report to the Secretary.’’ It also appears that the NAS panel never
received outside advice or testimony on the ARPA–E idea. Further-
more,  the  recommendation  to  create  an  ARPA–E  was  the  only  one
of 20 action items in the Gathering Storm report not to receive the
unanimous support of the panel. One of the panel members, the en-
ergy  industry  representative,  dissented  from  the  recommendation
of  the  panel.  Like  a  number  of  Members  of  the  Committee,  he  ex-
pressed concern that a new DARPA-like agency at DOE would put
the  government  in  the  position  of  picking  technology  winners  and

losers  for  the  private  sector.  Unlike  DARPA,  whose  primary  cus-
tomer  is  the  Federal  Government,  ARPA–E  is  supposed  to  pick
technologies for the private sector, which in contrast to the govern-
ment  is  much  more  sensitive  to  cost  and  price.  Recognizing  the  le-
gitimacy of this other perspective on the ARPA–E concept, even the
NAS  report  acknowledged  that,  ‘‘some  believe  that  industry  and
venture  capital  investors  will  already  fund  the  things  that  have  a
reasonable  probability  of  commercial  utility  (the  invisible  hand  of
the  free  markets  at  work),  and  what  is  not  funded  by  existing
sources is not worthy of funding.’’ Last Congress, the House passed
H.R. 6203, which included a provision directing the Secretary, with
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  to  conduct  a  detailed  study  of,
and  make  further  recommendations  on,  the  NAS  recommendation
to  establish  an  ARPA–E.  It  included  the  following  pertinent  ques-
tions:

1) What  basic  research  related  to  new  energy  technologies  is
occurring  now,  what  entities  are  funding  it,  and  what  is
preventing  the  results  of  that  research  from  reaching  the
market?

2) What economic evidence indicates that the limiting factor in
the market penetration of new energy technologies is a lack
of  basic  research  on  path-breaking  new  technologies?  What
barriers do those trying to develop new energy technologies
face during later stages of research and development?

3) To  what  extent  is  the  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency an appropriate model for an energy research agency,
given  that  the  Federal  Government  would  not  be  the  pri-
mary  customer  for  its  technology  and  where  cost  is  an  im-
portant concern?

4) How would research and development sponsored by ARPA–
E  differ  from  research  and  development  conducted  by  the
National  Laboratories  or  sponsored  by  the  Department
through  the  Office  of  Science,  the  Office  of  Energy  Effi-
ciency  and  Renewable  Energy,  the  Office  of  Fossil  Energy,
the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, and
the Office of Nuclear Energy?

5) Should  industry  or  National  Laboratories  be  recipients  of
ARPA–E  grants?  What  institutional  or  organizational  ar-
rangements  would  be  required  to  ensure  that  ARPA–E
sponsors  transformational,  rather  than  incremental,  re-
search and development?

While the bill was not signed into law, the questions still remain.
This was confirmed during a recent Energy and Environment Sub-
committee hearing at which all the witnesses agreed that the NAS
recommendation  was  vague  and  really  just  an  ‘‘idea.’’  One  of  the
witnesses,  John  Denniston,  a  partner  with  the  firm  Kleiner,  Per-
kins,  Caufeld  &  Byers,  said,  ‘‘I  don’t  think  that  the  Gathering
Storm report provided implementation details. I view it as an idea.
So, they don’t talk specifically about which technologies, fossil, nu-
clear, renewable. They don’t talk about stage of research, should it
be translational, is it basic, is it applied? They don’t talk about the
organizational details, much of which you have heard today.’’

Section  1821  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (EPAct)  also  con-
tained  a  study  on  the  applicability  of  the  management  practices
used  by  DARPA  and  the  advisability  of  creating  an  ARPA–E.  This
study was to have been completed by January of 2007. On May 22,
2007,  Ranking  Member  Hall  along  with  13  other  Members  of  this
committee  sent  a  letter  to  Secretary  of  Energy  Bodman  urging  the
agency  to  complete  the  study  and  implement  Section  1401  of
EPAct.  Section  1001  of  EPAct  directed  the  Secretary  to  appoint  a
Technology  Transfer  Coordinator  and  establish  a  Technology
Transfer Working Group.

As  an  alternative  to  the  bill,  Ranking  Member  Hall  along  with
Members  Gingrey,  and  Biggert  offered  a  substitute,  which  was  de-
feated,  addressing  the  aforementioned  concerns  with  the  bill.  The
substitute recognized that while the Department of Energy has the
authority  to  promote  technology  transfer  of  basic  and  applied  re-
search, a need exists to quickly identify opportunities to accelerate
the  commercial  application  of  new  energy  technologies  to  meet  the
Nation’s  energy  needs.  As  well,  a  fully  integrated  approach  to  ad-
vanced  energy  research  will  help  bridge  the  gap  between  basic  re-
search  and  applied  technology,  thus  overcoming  long-term  and
high-risk  barriers  to  the  development  of  advanced  energy  tech-
nologies.  The  substitute  conditioned  the  establishment  of  ARPA–E
on  the  Section  1821  study  in  EPAct  putting  forward  a  rec-
ommendation  that  the  management  practices  used  by  DARPA
would apply to research programs at DOE.

The  substitute  amendment  did  not  create  a  new  agency,  but  re-
quired  the  Secretary  to  use  existing  authority  coupled  with  newly
established  DARPA  like  hiring  authority  to  undertake  ARPA–E
type projects. It authorized $750 million over five years for the Sec-
retary to carry out the projects and required the Secretary to report
to  Congress  on  their  status.  It  permitted  the  Secretary  to  coordi-
nate with other agencies on advanced energy projects, directed the
Secretary to coordinate with the to-be-appointed Technology Trans-
fer Coordinator, allowed the Secretary to award prizes for achieve-
ment  under  an  advanced  energy  research  project,  and  established
cost  sharing  according  to  that  provided  in  the Energy  Policy  Act  of
2005.

While  we  have  the  utmost  respect  for  the  Chairman  and  for  the
positive manner in which debate on this bill ensued, we believe the
substitute addressed the goals sought by the Committee in a more
responsible  and  effective  manner.  Thus  we  are  unable  to  support
H.R. 364 in its current form.

X. COST ESTIMATE

A  cost  estimate  and  comparison  prepared  by  the  Director  of  the
Congressional Budget Office under section 402 of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974 has been timely submitted to the Committee on
Science  and  Technology  prior  to  the  filing  of  this  report  and  is  in-
cluded  in  Section  XI  of  this  report  pursuant  to  House  Rule  XIII,
clause 3(c)(3).

H.R. 364 does not contain new budget authority, credit authority,
or  changes  in  revenues  or  tax  expenditures.  Assuming  that  the
sums authorized under the bill are appropriated, H.R. 364 does au-
thorize  additional  discretionary  spending,  as  described  in  the  Con-
gressional  Budget  Office  report  on  the  bill,  which  is  contained  in
Section XI of this report.

XI. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

Summary

H.R.  364  would  authorize  the  appropriation  of  $4.9  billion  over
the  2008–2012  period  for  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  to  es-
tablish the Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA–E).
ARPA–E  would  award  competitive  grants,  cooperative  agreements,
and contracts for the research and development of projects with po-
tential energy and environmental applications. CBO estimates that
implementing  H.R.  364  would  cost  $4.1  billion  over  the  2008–2012
period,  assuming  the  appropriation  of  the  specified  amounts.  En-
acting  H.R.  364  would  have  no  effect  on  direct  spending  or  reve-
nues.

H.R.  364  contains  no  intergovernmental  or  private-sector  man-
dates  as  defined  in  the  Unfunded  Mandates  Reform  Act  (UMRA).
The  bill  would  benefit  public  institutions  of  higher  education  and

any  costs  they  may  incur  would  result  from  complying  with  condi-
tions of federal assistance.
Estimated Cost to the Federal Government

The estimated budgetary impact of H.R. 364 is shown in the fol-
lowing  table.  The  costs  of  this  legislation  fall  within  budget  func-
tion 250 (general science, space, and technology).

Basis of Estimate

For  this  estimate,  CBO  assumes  that  the  bill  will  be  enacted  in
fiscal  year  2007  and  that  the  amounts  authorized  by  the  bill  will
be  appropriated  for  each  fiscal  year.  H.R.  364  would  authorize  the
appropriation  of  $4.9  billion  over  the  next  five  years  to  establish
ARPA–E within DOE.

The  mission  of  the  new  agency  would  be  to  reduce  energy  im-
ports and greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and
develop  and  deploy  energy  technologies.  To  meet  these  goals,
ARPA–E  would  award  competitive  grants,  cooperative  agreements,
and  contracts  to  institutions  of  higher  education,  research  founda-
tions,  private  companies,  and  collaborations  of  trade  and  industry.
Such awards would be used to identify and promote significant ad-
vances  in  basic  sciences  that  have  potential  energy  and  environ-
mental applications, translate these discoveries into workable tech-
nologies, and accelerate their market adoption.

Based  on  the  historical  spending  patterns  of  similar  programs
(notably the DOE Office and Science and the Defense Advanced Re-
search  Projects  Agency),  CBO  estimates  that  implementing  H.R.
364 would cost $165 million in 2008 and $4.1 billion over the 2008–
2012  period,  assuming  appropriations  at  the  levels  specified  in  the
bill.
Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact

H.R.  364  contains  no  intergovernmental  or  private-sector  man-
dates  as  defined  in  UMRA.  Funding  authorized  by  the  bill  may
benefit  public  institutions  of  higher  education  that  compete  for
funds  in  connection  with  the  research  goals  of  ARPA–E.  Any  costs
that they might incur would result from complying with conditions
of federal assistance.

SUBCOMMITTEE  ON  ENERGY  AND  ENVIRON-
MENT  ON  H.R.  364,  TO  PROVIDE  FOR  THE
ESTABLISHMENT  OF  THE  ADVANCED  RE-
SEARCH  PROJECTS  AGENCY–ENERGY

THURSDAY,  MAY  10,  2007

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:15  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Nick  Lampson
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environ-
ment  will  come  to  order.  Pursuant  to  notice,  the  Subcommittee  on
Energy and Environment meets to consider the following measures:
H.R.  364,  To  provide  for  the  establishment  of  the  Advanced  Re-
search  Projects  Agency-Energy,  and  H.R.  632,  the  H–Prize  Act  of
2007.

We  will  now  proceed  with  the  markup  beginning  with  opening

statements and I will begin.

Today  we  will  consider  two  bills  that  represent  another  step  of
the  Committee’s  effort  to  push  the  envelope  of  technological  possi-
bility  and  provide  the  American  people  a  future  with  cheaper,
cleaner and better energy options.

For  decades  my  district  has  been  synonymous  with  oil  and  gas
or  energy  generally.  To  a  large  extent  it  has  been  the  economic
foundation  for  that  area,  for  the  great  State  of  Texas  and  even  for
the Nation. And the truth is that we should expect that oil, gas and
other  traditional  sources  of  energy  such  as  coal  and  nuclear  will
provide much of our nation’s energy for decades to come.

But the winds of change are indeed blowing. And the folks in my
district  know  as  well  as  anyone  the  predicament  that  we  face  in
sky-high  energy  prices,  the  environmental  impacts  of  our  energy
use and the critical need for maintaining jobs in the energy sector.
In  this  respect,  the  Nation  faces  a  challenge  like  none  we  have
encountered  before.  Unlike  the  Apollo  and  Manhattan  Projects
which galvanized our nation’s scientists to win a global race to put
a  man  on  the  Moon  or  create  a  ‘‘weapon  to  end  all  wars’’  there  is
no  finish  line  in  this  race.  We  are  attempting  to  transform  a  na-
tional  and  to  some  extent  global  economy  which  is  based  on  only

a  handful  of  unsustainable  energy  resources.  Resources  that  we
know will simply not last.

Despite  their  remarkable  technological  advances,  we  cannot  ex-
pect  the  energy  industry  and  the  current  programs  at  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  to  tackle  these  problems  on  their  own.  Only
through  ground-breaking  research  and  the  development  of  truly
transformational  technologies  can  we  begin  to  match  up  to  the
scale and the complexity of these challenges.

Now this requires from us a rock solid commitment to innovative
energy  R&D  and  a  leap  of  faith  that  somewhere  on  the  shelves  of
our  national  labs  or  in  the  garages  in  our  nation’s  inventors  or  in
the  halls  of  research  universities  there  are  discoveries  and  tech-
nologies waiting to be exploited by a new energy industry.

The  two  bills  that  we  are  here  to  mark  up  today  represent  the
kind  of  bold  efforts  that  are  needed  in  advancing  energy  research
and  ensuring  that  the  United  States  maintains  a  lead  in  these
emerging  technology  fields.  Therefore,  I  urge  their  passage  and
look forward to getting them to the House Floor.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Today  we  will  consider  two  bills  that  represent  another  step  in  this  committee’s
efforts  to  push  the  envelope  of  technological  possibility,  and  provide  the  American
people a future with cheaper, cleaner, better energy options.

For  decades  my  district  has  been  synonymous  with  oil  and  gas  (or  Energy,  gen-
erally).  To  a  large  extent  it  has  been  the  economic  foundation  for  this  area,  for  the
great State of Texas, and even for the Nation.

And  the  truth  is  that  we  should  expect  that  oil,  gas  and  other  more  traditional
sources of energy, such as coal and nuclear, will provide much of our nation’s energy
for decades to come.

But  the  winds  of  change  are  blowing,  and  the  folks  in  my  district  know  as  well
as anyone the predicament we face in sky-high energy prices, the environmental im-
pacts of our energy use, and the critical need for maintaining jobs in the energy sec-
tor.

In  this  respect,  the  Nation  faces  a  challenge  like  none  we  have  encountered  be-
fore.  Unlike  the  Apollo  and  Manhattan  projects,  which  galvanized  our  nation’s  sci-
entist  to  win  a  global  race  to  put  a  man  on  the  Moon,  or  create  a  ‘‘weapon  to  end
all wars,’’ there is no finish line in this race.

We  are  attempting  to  transform  a  national,  and  to  some  extent  global,  economy
which is based on only a handful of unsustainable energy resources. Resources that
we know will simply not last.

Despite  their  remarkable  technological  advances,  we  can’t  expect  the  energy  in-
dustry, and the current programs at the Department of Energy to tackle these prob-
lems on their own.

Only  through  ground-breaking  research,  and  the  development  of  truly  trans-
formational  technologies,  can  we  begin  to  match  up  to  the  scale  and  complexity  of

our  nation’s  inventors,  and  in  the  halls  of  our  research  universities,  there  are  dis-
coveries and technologies waiting to be exploited by a new energy industry.

The two bills that we are here to markup today represent the kind of bold efforts
that  are  needed  in  advancing  energy  research,  and  ensuring  the  U.S.  maintains  a
lead in these emerging technology fields.

Therefore  I  urge  their  passage,  and  look  forward  to  getting  them  to  the  House

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very——
Mr. INGLIS.—great to——
Chairman LAMPSON.—very much.
Mr. INGLIS.—have you back. You are looking great and——
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you.
Mr.  INGLIS.—healthy  and  all  of  that,  now  you  had  some  capable

folks filling in for you. But we are——

Chairman LAMPSON. I am very appreciative——
Mr. INGLIS.—but we are happy to have you back.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. INGLIS.—and, you know, it is helpful to be here today talking
about energy and two different bills that can help us achieve some
of the objectives that we have.

Sometimes people wonder about those objectives. My wife was at
a  gathering  a  couple  of  months  ago  and  a  lady  told  her  Bob  has
got  to  stop  talking  about  energy  so  much.  We  are  tired  of  hearing
from  him  about  energy.  I  would  note  that  as  the  price  of  gasoline
is  now  above  three  dollars  a  gallon  that  probably  Marianne  would
have a different message coming from that lady now and that it is
good  to  focus  a  lot  on  energy.  So  it  depends  on  what  the  price  at
the pump is as to whether we think it is a great thing to focus on.
But the objective of these bills today is to look long-term and not
to  the  gas  prices  that  fluctuate  up  and  down  based  on  the  month.
I  do  hope  that  we  take  the  message  from  those  gas  prices,  that
they are volatile. They will go up and down. But the long-term tra-
jectory  has  to  be  up.  And  so  therefore  we  are  looking  for  energy
sources besides those.

And  so  today  two  bills  that  help  us  get  to  there—to  that  place
of  energy  independence,  we  hope,  one  is,  ARPA–E,  which  is  de-
signed  to  create  breakthrough  technology  opportunities,  and  the
other, the H–Prize Bill, which is even a little bit longer-term propo-
sition, but that can hopefully lead us to a new source of energy. So
we  are  happy  to  be  here  marking  up  these  bills,  Mr.  Chairman.  I
have  got  a  more  complete  opening  statement  that  I  would  like  to
submit for the record.

Chairman LAMPSON. With no—without objection.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  this  markup  on  the  establishment  of  the
H–Prize  and  ARPA–E.  The  bills  we  discuss  today  represent  a  common  goal:  har-
nessing  American  innovation  to  meet  our  need  for  energy  and  improve  our  energy
security.

One  hundred  years  ago,  the  space  travel  concept  was  madness.  Forty  years  ago,
only  a  select  group  of  elite  astronauts  could  visit  the  Moon.  Ten  years  ago,  just  a
handful  of  visionaries  thought  that  the  highway  to  space  would  soon  open  to  all
travelers.  Today,  paying  customers  can  pre-book  flights  to  space,  and  in  two  years,
from their seat on a space plane, they will take digital pictures of the Earth to share
with their friends and family back home.

Twelve  short  years  mark  the  gap  between  science  fiction  and  commercial  space
flight. Imagination and innovation bridged the gap. In 1996, Peter Diamandis joined
forces with the Ansari family of investors and created the X–Prize, offering $10 mil-
lion  to  the  first  reusable  sub-orbital  space  vehicle.  Eight  years  later,  Burt  Rutan’s
SpaceshipOne  won  the  prize,  launching  into  sub-orbital  space  flight  twice  in  two
weeks.  Shortly  after,  Richard  Branson  teamed  up  with  Rutan,  and  Virgin  Galactic
will soon convert a space-age science project into a new tourist industry.

The  energy  industry  in  2007  looks  a  lot  like  the  space  flight  sector  did  in  1996.
We’ve seen important incremental gains, but overall innovation has slowed. We de-

pend on volatile fossil fuels, scratch our head at how to deal with carbon emissions,
and  get  more  and  more  frustrated  with  each  cent  increase  in  the  cost  of  gasoline.
We know that there has to be a better way to do energy.

Taking a prize approach to the energy problem allows our imagination to run with
the prospects of coupling a pioneering vision with a hydrogen prize, or H–Prize, in-
centive for innovation in hydrogen energy. Our history tells us that what starts with
an  imaginative  dream  or  vision  typically  finishes  in  a  legacy  of  American  innova-
tion.  There’s  a  multi-billion,  if  not  trillion,  dollar  industry  that  we  can  create  from
a hydrogen energy source free of emissions, renewable, cost-effective, and American-
made.

Imagine  an  inventor  in  Spartanburg,  SC  and  an  entrepreneur  in  Greenville
teaming up to work on the challenge of hydrogen storage. The entrepreneur secures
a license for metal hydride storage material from the Hydrogen Research Center at
the Savannah River National Lab. The inventor is a retiree from the Oak Ridge Na-
tional  Lab,  with  a  lifetime  of  experience  in  alternative  fuels.  They’ve  heard  about
the  H–Prize,  and  it’s  provided  the  spark  to  light  the  fuse  of  their  imagination.  The
Discovery  Channel  has  a  new  idea  for  a  show  on  alternative  fuels,  and  has  agreed
to follow their progress.

They set to work improving the material to store more hydrogen at lower weight,
and a year later they submit their work to the H–Prize judging panel for best incre-
mental  gain  in  storage  technology.  Their  careful  work  wins  the  prize,  and  they’ve
got $1 million to show for it. They use part of the money to pay their investors, but
they convince their investors that they could win even bigger in the prototype com-
petition. They assemble a small team and get to work.

After  a  year  of  all-nighters  and  Ramen  noodles,  they  have  their  prototype  for  a
storage subsystem. The Discovery Channel has the beginnings of a new reality show
(who  knew  scientists  could  be  so  caddy?).  Their  metal  hydride  dust  could  fill  the
frame  of  a  car,  safely  providing  the  hydrogen  fuel  and  eliminating  the  need  for  a
fuel tank. BMW loves the idea and before their team even won the $4 million prize
for  best  prototype,  BMW  is  competing  to  license  their  technology  for  the  next
version of the Hydrogen 7 sedan.

Now  the  team’s  investors  are  really  buzzing.  They’ve  partnered  with  automotive
engineering  departments  at  several  universities  and  are  hard  at  work  designing  a
new mass-producible vehicle at Clemson University’s International Center for Auto-
motive  Research  in  Greenville.  They’ve  got  their  eyes  on  the  grand  prize  for  trans-
formational  technologies.  Duke  Power  has  become  a  partner  to  provide  economical,
carbon-free  hydrogen  from  nuclear  power.  A  local  gasoline  marketer  has  jumped  in
to  help  with  distribution,  offering  modified  fuel  trucks  running  on  biodiesel  and
pump  space  for  hydrogen.  Corporate  investors  from  around  the  world  are  pitching
in  to  get  their  logo—NASCARstyle—on  the  car,  fueling  station,  and  everything  in
between.

The  South  Carolina  team  is  only  one  of  many  around  the  country,  but  the  Dis-
covery  Channel  cameras  testify  that  their  hearts  are  in  it  to  win.  Over  the  course
of five years, Team Palmetto assembles, jimmy-rigs, and invents the technologies to
take them to the top. The judges deem them the best, and they receive the $10 mil-
lion cash prize for their hard work. Of course, at this point their investors see that
more gains lie ahead, so the team easily raises $40 million in venture capital, which
is matched by other private money for corporate sponsorship of the H–Prize. Within
three years, their emission-free HyFlyer cars zipping along the East and West Coast
Hydrogen Highways, in Europe, and even Japan and China.

It’s  not  so  farfetched.  The  prize  idea  has  worked  in  the  past,  from  the  Trans-
continental  Railroad,  to  Lindbergh  and  the  Orteig  Prize,  to  Burt  Rutan  and  the  X–
Prize.  Others  see  the  prize  working  in  the  future:  the  Automotive  X–Prize,  Rep.
Frank Wolf’s NSF prize, Rep. Dan Lungren’s Automotive Prize. H–Prize has the ad-
vantage  of  focusing  on  a  far  reaching  technology  where  breakthroughs  are  needed
and  harnessing  the  American  innovative  and  entrepreneurial  spirit  to  tackle  those
challenges.

Prize money is one seed from which energy technology and industry can grow. But
it will not be the only source for energy breakthroughs. There is still a need for re-
search  and  development  funding  for  our  nation’s  scientists,  labs,  and  universities.
The  ARPA–E  bill  that  we  will  markup  today  addresses  a  need  to  sponsor  explo-
ration in high-risk endeavors.

ARPA–E  research  could  offer  a  big  payoff  in  the  commercial  energy  market.  At
the same time, I already see real payoffs coming from existing DOE research, espe-
cially  hydrogen,  nuclear,  wind,  and  solar  programs.  I’m  concerned  that  the  ARPA–
E  fund  will  divert  funds  away  from  these  existing  programs  and  jeopardize  the  ad-
vances we’re already seeing in these areas. I hope that we can find a way to ensure
this doesn’t happen.

Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you on these two

bills.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you. I look forward to the markup here.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Ranking  Member
Inglis. And I think it is appropriate because we have the Chairman
of  the  Science  Committee  here  with  us  today,  Mr.  Bart  Gordon,
that  we  give  him  an  opportunity  to  make  some  comments.  Mr.
Chairman?

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson.  And  let  me

also say welcome back and——

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you.
Chairman  GORDON.—we  are  glad  that  you  are  looking  fit  as  a
fiddle. I will say in your absence that Ms. Giffords did an excellent
job with a very informative hearing the other day.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Believe  it  or  not,  I  heard  that  all  the  way

down in Texas.

Chairman  GORDON.  So,  you  better  look  over  your  shoulder.  And
Mr.  Inglis,  you  know  almost  all  of  Former  Chairman  Boehlert’s
opening statements, I would say I concur. And let me continue that
by  saying  I  concur  with  your  opening  statement.  And  particularly,
in  not  taking  the  short  view  of  this.  You  know,  back  in  the  ’70s  if
we  had  followed  through  on  some  of  the  initiatives  that  we  talked
about we would not be in this situation now.

Now  to  this  bill.  And  I  want  to  thank  you  for  bringing  up  H.R.
364.  If  you  read  the  Washington  Post  this  morning  on  the  top  left-
hand  side  you  saw  where  Mayor  Fenty  had  gotten  into  some  trou-
ble  because  he  had  plagiarized  some  of  the  statements  in  a  Char-
lotte,  North  Carolina  program  that  was  similar  to  his  efforts  to
take  over  the  school  system  here.  So  I  want  to  make  it  very  clear
today  that  I  am  plagiarizing  with  permission.  This  is  not  a  Bart
Gordon Bill. This is not a Democratic bill. This is not a Republican
bill.  This  is  simply  putting  into  legislative  language  the  rec-
ommendations of the Rising Above the Gathering Storm.

And  we  are  familiar  with  this.  I  will  not  belabor  it.  But  quickly
to  say,  when  we  ask  them  to  look  at  competitiveness  of  American
21st  Century,  they  had  two  recommendations:  one  with  the  Math
and  Science  skills  and  the  other  was  energy  independence.  And
this  was  prior  to  the  price  of  oil  going  up.  And  I  think  they  were
very  farsighted  in  seeing  that.  And  so,  that  is  what  we  attempt  to
do today.

It is a bill that is modeled after, and once again on their sugges-
tions, the successful DARPA program. It has a nimble organization
with  a  minimal  amount  of  administrative  layers.  Its  purpose  is  to
look at high-risk high-reward areas that the private sector will not
invest in. This is the basic of the basic research. And you also have
to  keep  in  mind  that  since  the  ’80s  that  the  federal  energy  tech-
nologies R&D, is down 85 percent. And so this is a very important
way.

And  I  think  the  key  to  it  is  again  looking  at  those  high  risk
areas,  bringing  the  public  sector  to  the  private  sector  or  national
labs,  the  universities,  everyone  together  to  crash  on  these  and  to
make some real breakthroughs. I know that a number of the Com-
mittee  Members  met  this  weekend  with  the  International  Energy
Association.  And  you  will  remember  in  talking  about  it  they  see

sort of a three-legged stool to energy independence as well as deal-
ing  with  the  climate  change.  One  is  conservation.  The  second  is
better use of our existing energy sources. And the third is this type
of  transformational  technology.  Not  only  for  new  types  of  tech-
nology but also to use our existing types of fuels better. So I think
this is very important.

I  know  that  there  will  be  some  that  say  that  the  authorizing
level  is  too  high.  Let  me  say  the  authorizing  level  is  the  rec-
ommendation  from  the  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm  that  the
appropriators ultimately in the House Floor will determine what is
the  actual  appropriation.  But  I  think  that  it  is  wise  to  give  flexi-
bility.  Others  might  say  that  well,  you  know,  the  Energy  Depart-
ment is doing a good job. Let us do not, you know, throw something
else in there. Well, if you are satisfied with status quo then we do
not need this. I am not. I think we can do a better job. I think this
is an important bill.

I  thank  the  Subcommittee  for  the  good  hearings  that  they  have
had  and  I  thank  them  for  bringing  up  this  bill.  And  I  yield  back
my time.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

I  would  like  to  thank  Chairman  Lampson  and  the  other  Members  of  the  Energy
& Environment Subcommittee for their assistance in bringing H.R. 364, a bill to es-
tablish an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, before the Subcommittee
this morning.

I first introduced this bill in the 109th Congress in response to recommendations

in the National Academies report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm.

This report recognized that the U.S. dependence on traditional energy sources and

outdated technologies puts us in a perilous position.

We cannot afford to wait until we face severe disruptions to fossil energy supplies

or serious impacts from climate change to address this challenge.

The  Gathering  Storm  report  recommended  establishing  ARPA–E,  modeled  on
DARPA’s  successful  innovation  model,  to  sponsor  creative  out-of-the-box,  trans-
formational  energy  research  in  those  areas  where  the  private  sector  cannot  or  will
not invest on its own.

DARPA  succeeded  largely  because  it  fostered  a  culture  of  innovation.  We  cannot
legislate an agency’s culture. But we can set up a nimble organization with minimal
administrative  layers  and  the  ability  to  quickly  start  and  stop  research  programs.
These elements are key to the success of ARPA–E, and to transforming energy R&D
from the laboratory bench into market-ready technologies.

This  transformation  simply  won’t  happen  on  the  cheap.  We  must  commit  to  pro-
viding  adequate  resources  to  get  us  there.  We  simply  have  not  been  making  the
kind of investments needed to move us into a new energy future.

During  the  past  35  years,  we  have  become  more  dependent  upon  foreign  energy
supplies and greenhouse gas emissions have grown so that we face an uncertain fu-
ture due to climate change.

During  this  same  time  period,  federal  investment  in  energy  technology  R&D  has

declined by 85 percent from its peak in 1978. We must reverse this trend.

Investment in ARPA–E must be seen as the first step in boosting energy research
and development to a level that addresses the true scale of the challenge before us,
and the true cost of doing transformational research.

Establishing  an  ARPA–E  in  H.R.  364  is  a  bold  step,  but  we’ve  got  to  be  willing
to push this envelope, make some tough but firm commitments to get the job done.
I appreciate my colleagues’ support, and I look forward to continuing to work with

all of you as this legislation moves forward.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  note  that
Ranking  Member  Hall  is  not  here  right  now  and  when  he  comes
in he will also be called on for opening remarks that he might want

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

to  make.  Without  objection,  Members  may  place  statements  in  the
record at this point.

We  will  now  consider  H.R.  364  to  provide  for  the  establishment
of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. I yield five min-
utes to Mr. Gordon to describe this bill.

Chairman GORDON. Mr. Chairman, I think that I have and I will
not take the Committee’s time to do it again. I think that we have
had  adequate  hearings  on  it.  It  is  a  bipartisan  bill  with  many  co-
sponsors  and  I  think  my  earlier  opening  remarks  accomplished
that.  So  I  will  yield  it  back  but  would  certainly  be  open  to  any
questions that anyone would like to have for clarification.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  recognize

Mr. Inglis to present any remarks he has on the bill.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And,  you  know,  I  might  ask  the  Chairman  a  couple
of  questions  as  part  of  that.  There  are  some  questions  over  here.
We think that we share the same vision. We also are excited about
investing in this kind of breakthrough technology. That is what we
have  been  talking  about  for  a  long  time  on  this  committee.  There
are some questions and maybe you can help clear them up.

One  of  the  challenges  of  the  Department  of  Energy  has  been  a
bunch  of  earmarks  that  have  eaten  up  the  money  that  was  avail-
able to pursue projects that would really be breakthroughs. Do you
have  any  sense  that  in  the  setup  that  we  are  going  to  be  able  to
avoid that scenario—that with the six billion that we would author-
ize that somehow we can protect it from earmarks for less than op-
timal demonstration projects?

Chairman GORDON. If the Chairman—or if the Ranking Member
would  yield,  I  think  that  we  saw  that  in  DARPA  that  we  did  not
see any type of earmarks. Within the National Science Foundation
you do not see earmarks.

Mr. INGLIS. Right.
Chairman GORDON. And so this committee should, I think, be on
full  record  as  saying  that  there  should  not  be  earmarks.  I  mean,
there is not going to be a lot of projects. There is only going to be,
you  know,  maybe  seven  or  eight  projects.  And  we  need  to  put  the
full  resources  toward  those.  So  I  would  work  with  you  in  any  way
to avoid that.

Mr. INGLIS. Yeah, because that would be a major concern of mine
is  figuring  out  a  way  to  follow  the  NSF  model,  which  functions  so
well  and  has  excellence  and  pursues  really  good  things.  But—and
I  hope  you  share  the  concern  that  the  Department  of  Energy—we
have  had,  for  example,  in  the  hydrogen  area.  The  reports  we  get
back  from  the  DOE  folks  is  we  could  make  some  progress  in  this
area  if  it  were  not  for  spending  money  on  member-directed  initia-
tives into small, not likely to produce many results, kind of things.
And——

Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  gentleman  would  yield,  you  know,  po-
tentially, for whatever it is worth, I think we should put report lan-
guage  into  this  bill  to  that  effect  and  would  be  glad  to  work  with
you  in  any  way  to  accomplish  that.  And  I  think,  you  know,  we  as
a  committee  need  to  stand  firm  on  the  floor  against  anything  like
that.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Well,  that  would  be  helpful  and  help  me—as  to  say
we  share  the  same  vision  and  maybe  a  number  of  the  same  goals

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

88

and  strategies.  The  concern  that  I  have  is  that  it  really  has  to  do
with making something in DOE working right.

Chairman GORDON. If the Ranking Member would yield, I would
consider that this was a failure if that happened. I mean, it is com-
pletely  contrary  to  the  purpose  of  ARPA–E  and  it  would  be  a  fail-
ure.  And  I  will  work  with  you  in  any  way  to  avoid  that.  And  let
me  also  say  that  we  are  going  to  have,  there  is  going  to  be  an
amendment,  I  think,  that  encompasses  a  variety  of  recommenda-
tions  that  have  been  made  from  both  sides.  And  rather  than  have
a  markup  next  week  at  the  Full  Committee  level,  you  know,  I
would  like  to  postpone  that  for  two  weeks  so  that  we  can  continue
to work in a collaborative effort over these next two weeks if there
is anything else that comes up like that because again I think this
is  a  good  bill  but  it  can  be  made  better  as  there  are  questions
raised. So I would, you know, would work with you in any way we
can do to accomplish our common goal.

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  would  be  happy  to  yield  back  for  the  rest  of  my
opening  statement.  It  was  not  an  opening  statement.  I  had  some
questions. But that is helpful here at the Committee.

Chairman LAMPSON. Ms. Biggert.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too would like to wel-
come you back. I have a question, first of all, for counsel, if I might
and then a question for Chairman Gordon. I would like to know is
there a definition of consortia in the current law or is it a procure-
ment  term  of  art?  And  does  it  speak  to  a  lead  entity?  It  is  cited
in the bill on page four, lines six through 19.

Chairman LAMPSON. On page four, the consortia that is intended
in  this  bill—I  am  not  aware  that  it  is  defined  in  current  law.  And
this  does  refer  to  consortia  of  institutions  of  higher  education  and
companies  or  consortia  that  may  include  federally  funded  research
and development centers.

Ms. BIGGERT. Does it——
Chairman LAMPSON. It does not designate a lead entity.
Ms. BIGGERT. All right. Then Chairman Gordon, we have worked
so  hard,  I  think,  to  increase  the  funding  for  the  Office  of  Science
and  I  think  that  it  really  has  gone  up.  Even  this  year  we  wrote  a
letter  to  make  sure  that—and  it  was  put  into  the  supplemental—
that  we  would  increase  that  money  to  keep  the  labs  open  at  that
point.  I  believe,  and  I  think  we  all  believe,  in  basic  research  and
development.  How  do  we  ensure  that  the  money  that  goes  to  the
basic  research,  the  Office  of  Science,  does  not  provide  an  offset  to
put more money into ARPA–E?

Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  gentlelady  would  yield,  first  to  your
concern  about  consortium,  if  you  feel  that  that  needs  to  be  better
defined  then  certainly  we  need  to  work  to  accomplish  that.  You
know, I mean, there are no guarantees around here. I certainly do
not  think  that  should  happen.  What  our  purpose  is—there  is,  for
lack  of  a  better  term,  a  bit  of  a  trust  fund  that  is  going  to  be  cre-
ated with the recruitment from some of the tax breaks from the oil
industry. And I think this will be the major source for that. Again,
I think we need to do more, not less.

I  think  there  are  really  two  different  types  of  research.  This  is
going  to  be  cutting-edge  research  things  that  the  Office  of  Science
is  not  doing  now.  And  it  will  be  under  that  kind  of  microscope.  It

89

will have to be more nimble and be able to get things done. It will
be working with the labs. And I, you know, I would like to give you
a  guarantee,  but  there  are  no  guarantees  other  than  that  I  would
certainly oppose that.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  I  have  concerns  about  the
fact that we authorize the funds and then the appropriators are the
ones  that  actually  determine  the  amounts  and  that  is  where  we
lose control of this, that——

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  if  the  gentlelady  would  yield.  Again,
this is a different concept. And it—and if you think that status quo
at whatever funding level within the Department of Energy on cut-
ting-edge  technology  is  working,  then  maybe  we  do  not  need  this.
But if you think that we do need breakthroughs than this is an im-
portant—if  you  want  to  say—I  do  not  even  think  it  is  a  risk.  I
think this is something that has to be done.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  do  have  some  concerns  and  we  will  discuss  that
later,  but  let  me  go  back  then  to  consortia.  There  is  no  definition
in this. Is there a definition in the Federal Acquisition Regulations?

Chairman GORDON. I am not aware of a definition.
Ms. BIGGERT. I think we need to work on that to make sure that
we define exactly how that would work. And my concern is whether
you have, let us say, a couple of scientists from a national lab and
they have an idea and wanted to use this, can they be the lead en-
tity? I mean, it would—that they would have to either go to a uni-
versity  or  they  would  have  to  go  to  a  company  in  order  to  be  able
to proceed with their scientific discovery.

Chairman GORDON. If the gentlelady would yield. I will read you
the  language  here:  ‘‘The  Director  shall  administer  the  fund  estab-
lished  under  Section  3  to  award  competitive  grants,  cooperative
agreements or contracts to institutions of higher education, compa-
nies or consortia or such entities which may include federally fund-
ed  research  and  development  centers  to  achieve  the  goals  stated.’’
And then it goes on.

Ms. BIGGERT. The question——
Chairman  GORDON.  Let  me  tell  you  what  I  think  it  means.  It
means  that  the  director  will  be  able  to  look  again  at  the  private
sector,  the  public  sector,  the  labs,  the  universities,  anyone  that  is
doing  some  work  in  a  particular  area,  bring  the  best  of  that  to-
gether. That is my intention. And if you do not think that our lan-
guage accomplishes that then we will try to get better language.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you.  I  think  in  putting  on  my  lawyer  hat
that the way that it is written is that you have got two institutions
of higher education——

Chairman GORDON. Yes.
Ms.  BIGGERT.—companies  or—and  this  is  where—if  it  said  com-
petitive  grants  to  institutions  of  higher  education,  companies,  fed-
eral  funded  research  and  development  centers  or  a  consortia  of
such——

Chairman GORDON. Yeah.
Ms. BIGGERT.—you see——
Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  if  the  gentlelady  will  yield.  I  think
often times—and I am sure you are concerned about labs. And the
labs are——

Ms. BIGGERT. Obviously.

Chairman  GORDON.—consortium,  you  know,  in  most  situations.
It  would  be  my  expectation  that  in  most  anything  you  do  here  the
labs  are  going  to  play  a  major  role.  I  do  not  know  where  there  is
more  expertise  than  in  the  labs.  So  this  is  not—if—this  is  not  an
effort  to  take  them  out.  If  anything,  it  is  to  step  up  what  they  are
doing in those areas. And we will work to get that——

Ms. BIGGERT. Okay.
Chairman GORDON.—language so that it is so reflected.
Ms. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman and yield back.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  gentlelady.  Does  anyone  else

wish to be recognized? Mr. Balart.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also want to first
have  my  words  to  let  you  know—express  that  we  are  very  happy
that  you  are  back  and  you  look  good  and  we  know  you  are  in  for
the fight again, so it is great to have you back.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  My  question—obviously  the  intent  is  one  that
we  will  share  and  is  good.  My  question  would  be  what  is  the  cost
of the actual Department going to—how much is that going to cost?
In  other  words,  I  understand  what  it  is  trying  to  do,  but  it  would
seem  to  me  that  if  there  is  a  way  to  do  it  without  creating  a  new
entity,  a  new  bureaucracy,  that  that  would  be  the  preferable  way
to do it, if it is possible. So the question is why is that not possible?
And also, if you have some numbers on the cost—preliminary num-
bers on what the cost actually is of the actual department.

Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  gentleman  would  yield.  What  we  are
trying  to  do  is  de-bureaucrat  it.  We  may  not  share  this  view,  I
think, within previous Democratic and Republican administrations.
Many think that once ideas get into the bureaucracy of the Depart-
ment  of  Energy  they  sometimes  get  stuck  in  the  mud.  What  we
want to do is have a very lean operation here with as few adminis-
trators as possible. And it is pulling these groups together. So, you
know, again I think we are trying to accomplish what you want to
see done. To the question of the cost, the authorization level would
be $300,000 in the first year going up to a billion dollars thereafter.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. I yield back.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I clearly
understand  what  the  intent  is  and  I  applaud  the  intent.  And  you
are absolutely right that obviously things do get stuck in the mud,
so to speak, as you said, sir, in the Department of Energy. My only
question  is,  I  mean,  we  are  dealing  here  with  the  Federal  Govern-
ment.  And  we  are  dealing  with  a  new  department  in  the  Federal
Government.  Not  in,  you  know,  even  the  State  of  Florida  or  not
even in some foreign country. When you are dealing with a new de-
partment  in  the  Federal  Government—and  I  am  just  concerned,
but  I  am  not  questioning  the  sponsor’s  intent.  But  creating  a  new
department  is  something  that  frankly  does  not  seem  to  be  in  my
view  a  solution  to  create  less  bureaucracy.  Because  when  you  are
dealing with the Federal Government, federal departments are the
bureaucracy,  are  the  problems,  are  the  cause  of  all  the  mud—
things stuck in the mud. So it is——

Chairman GORDON. If the gentleman would yield.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Yes, sir.

I——

Chairman  GORDON.  I  need  to  correct  myself.  I  said  $300,000.  It
is  $300  million  to  start.  So,  pardon  me.  Again,  I  would  say  that
DARPA  demonstrated  that—and  some  would  say  that  sometimes
things  get  stuck  in  the  Department  of  Defense,  too,  and  that
DARPA  demonstrated  that  when  you  can  take  an  agency  out  of
that  bureaucracy,  make  it  lean.  And  again,  what  they  are  doing
is—this  is  not  layers.  It  is  a  project  manager  that  then  is  trying
to bring together, again, the public sector, private sector labs to ac-
complish  something.  And  so  I  do  not  think  they  could  do  it  any
other  way.  And  again,  the  private  sector  clearly  is  not  going  to
make  these  kinds  of  cutting-edge  recommendations—or  cutting-
edge  investments.  And  if  you  think  that  somehow  the  department
is  going  to  turn  over  a  new  leaf  and  do  this  better  than  they  have
over decades than maybe this is not a good idea. I do not have that
confidence.

Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your indulgence.
And I appreciate it. I do not have—I clearly do not have the years
of  experience  that  you  do  have  here.  Obviously  in  a  perfect  world
what  one  would  do  is  task  people  who  are  already  there  in  that
huge  department  to  get  it  done  as  opposed  to  creating  a  new  de-
partment;  which  for  somebody  who  has  not  been  here  that  long
frankly  sounds  counter-intuitive  that,  in  order  to  shrink  the  bu-
reaucracy you create a new one. That just sounds counter-intuitive
for someone who does not have the experience as you all. And that
is why to me it is kind of a hard sell.

Chairman GORDON. If the gentleman would yield.
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. And again, thank you for your indulgence and

Chairman GORDON. Oh, sure. If the gentleman would yield. I will
not take offense with you calling me an old man. Experience is dif-
ferent altogether. And let me, you know, again, we are getting into
things  that  maybe  are  not  fully  accurate.  And  I  would  hate  to  say
it publicly, but there are those that think that a lot of the real tal-
ented  folks  within  the  Department  of  Energy  have  been  poached
out into the private sector. There are those who say a lot of the tal-
ented  people  get  frustrated  with  the  bureaucracy  there  and  leave.
And  so  we  want  to  pay  more.  You  know,  I  mean,  we  want  to  pay
well and have an exciting challenge so that you can bring the very
best  people  in  the  world.  If  they  are  the  very  best  people  for  the
Department of Energy, we ought to get them. If the very best per-
son is in Exxon or is in anywhere else, let us go get them and bring
them  into  this.  That  is  what  we  want  to  try  to  accomplish.  I  yield
back.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Chairman,  can  I  have  one  last  question?

Again, you have been very generous with allowing me to——

Chairman  GORDON.  Certainly.  I  will  point  out—and—I  think  we
are  going  to  have  votes  in  a  few  minutes  here,  but  that  should
not—this is too important to rush. But I will just—I will point that
out. Yes, sir. I welcome your question.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you.  And  again,  you  have  been  ex-
tremely kind with time, Chairman. Just this—will this new depart-
ment  have  a  different  setup?  Will  people  be  able  to  get  fired  or  is
there  going  to  be  pretty  much  the  same  federal  protections  that
people  have  in  other  departments  so  that  once  you  are  there  basi-

92

cally—it  is  almost  impossible  to  get  fired?  Because  obviously  if  it
was  different—if  it  was  an  innovative  new  kind  of  outside  the  box
thinking where people would get paid for performance—and I think
that  is  obviously  what  the  private  sector  does  and  you  could  get
fired  if  you  do  not  perform  then  that  might  be  something  very  in-
teresting. Or is it going to be pretty much the same—I do not know
how that works.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  first  let  me  ask  counsel,  here.  How
many—how  large  a  staff  would  be  there?  What  would  be  your  ex-
pectation?

The  COUNSEL.  Well,  depending  on  the  size  of  the  budget,  of
course,  it  is  not  stated,  but  there  could  be  anywhere—it  is  really
guessing right now—50 people or so.

Chairman GORDON. So——
The  COUNSEL.  I  mean,  if  they  had  a  very  large  budget  it  would

of course be more.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  think  if  you  have  50  or  even  100  people
counting, you know, clerical folks there, they are going to be under
a spotlight. They cannot hide. And this is important business. And
this is not a place for folks to go retire. And I think that is the good
thing  about  starting  it  up  new.  You  know,  you  are  not  bringing
them  in  on  seniority  basis.  You  are  bringing  in  the  best  and  the
brightest to get a job done. I yield back. I guess-and the final thing
is—again,  I  cannot  give  guarantees  to  anything.  We  can  just  take
our  best  shot.  But  we  can  look  at  models  that  have  worked  that
seems reasonable. And I think you and I should have a joint hear-
ing  on  oversight  on  anyone  who  is  not  doing  their  job  there.  And
I would welcome to join you in that.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  know,  as  I  understand  that,  there  is
going  to  be  basically  temporary  people  rotated  in  and  out  three  to
five years. So there should not be a problem.

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  You  know,  it  would  be  interesting.  I  under-
stand where the Chairman is going. It might be interesting to look
at  that  performance  criteria  and  sunsets—that  if  you  do  not  meet
a certain performance criteria, and I do not know what those would
be obviously, that the department goes away.

Chairman GORDON. If the gentleman would yield. It is somewhat
counter-intuitive  to  what  we  are  trying  to  do.  We—I  mean,  I  do
not—this  is  a  bad  way  to  say  it.  We  expect  some  people  to  fail.  I
mean,  the  Internet  was  successful  in  DARPA.  The  technology  was
successful.  How  many  were  not  successful?  You  know,  this  is  an
area that we want people not to be afraid to fail. And so, you know,
failure  is  not  your  idea  did  not  work  out  but  you  did  not  hit  your
best lick in trying it. So I think you have to be careful. Sometimes,
quite  frankly,  when  you  talk  in  the  scientific  community  they  talk
about  old  DARPA  and  new  DARPA.  New  DARPA  has  gotten  to  be
more  of  a  less—it  is  more  risk  averse  because  they  do  not  want  to
have  those  failures,  where  old  DARPA  was  looking—you  know,
they were swinging for the fences. And that is what we want these
folks to do. I yield back.

Chairman LAMPSON. The Chair recognizes Mr. Bartlett.
Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much. Actually, in basic research
and  leading  edge  engineering  there  are  no  failures.  You  pursue
something  that  you  think  may  bear  fruit  and  if  it  does  not  bear

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

93

fruit  you  know  it  does  not  and  that  is  not  a  failure.  You  look  at
science very differently than you do the business world. Everything
you do in science is successful. You have a hypothesis. You are test-
ing  a  hypothesis  and  you  either  have  reason  to  accept  it  or  not  to
accept the hypothesis. So it is a learning experience. If we are pat-
terned after—if ARPA–E is patterned after DARPA, there is no bu-
reaucracy.  And  they  intentionally  bring  fresh  blood  in  and  they
stay only a relative few years and they cycle through. So this is not
going  to  be  a  bureaucracy.  I  would  just  like  to  return  to  the  ques-
tion  that  Ms.  Biggert  referred  to,  and  that  is  lines  eight,  nine  and
10 on page four, where we enumerate the entities to which we will
give  these  contracts.  And  there  is  a  danger  when  you  have  a  list
like this that it will tend to limit to whom you give contracts. And
every  one  of  these  is  a  bureaucracy  of  some  sort  or  another.  I  will
shortly  have  my  81st  birthday.  And  I  have  worked  on  a  lot  of  dif-
ferent  jobs  and  I  will  tell  you  that  bureaucracies,  wherever  they
are, are stifling. Whether it is universities or businesses—I worked
for IBM. I worked for the really big guys. And we have no—we ap-
parently  here  have  excluded  that  entrepreneur  out  there—that
small business man who may be a company of one who has a really
great idea. Are we not going to give him a chance?

Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  gentleman  would  yield.  I  am  of  the
opinion  that  there  is  a  garage  scientist  somewhere  that  probably,
you  know,  has—you  know,  the  best  ideas  come  out  of  the  garage.

Mr. BARTLETT. Right.
Chairman  GORDON.  There  is  somebody  that  is  thinking  outside
the  box.  So  clearly  these  project  managers  would  have  the  option
to go, you know, anywhere and everywhere.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  But  we  should  yet  put  wording  in  here  that  they

would interpret precluded them from doing that, right?

Chairman  GORDON.  Correct.  And  again,  I  think  that  we  need  to
work  over  these  next  two  weeks,  meeting  your  concerns  and  Ms.
Biggert’s concern. And maybe less is better than more but we need
to get this language correct and we will.

Mr. BARTLETT. And I am big fan of this. If we had leadership in
our  country  on  energy  starting  from  the  White  House  down  to  the
Department  of  Energy  we  might  not  need  this.  But  the  sad  truth
is  that  we  do  not  have  adequate—we  do  not  have  leadership  ade-
quate  to  the  challenge  out  there.  This  may  not  work.  But  nothing
we  are  doing  now  works.  And  so,  you  know,  let  us  try  this.  This
has a big chance of working. DARPA has been enormously success-
ful.  And  there  is  no  entity  in  our  government  that  had  such  lever-
age  as  DARPA  has.  And  let  us  hope  that  ARPA–E  can  be—if  it  is
half as successful as DARPA, it is going to be a big success. Thank
you very much and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing us this.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  Anyone  else?  I  might  mention
that the word ‘‘companies’’ certainly would not be limited to one or
two people. And access hopefully is adequately responded to in this.
Anyone else seek recognition? If not, then I ask unanimous consent
that  the  bill  is  considered  as  read  and  open  to  amendment  at  any
point  and  that  Members  proceed  with  the  amendments  in  order  of
the roster. Without objection, it is so ordered.

First amendment on the roster is a managers amendment offered
by  myself  and  Ms.  Giffords.  Now  the  Clerk  will  report  the  amend-
ment.

The  CLERK.  Amendment  to  H.R.  364  offered  by  Mr.  Lampson  of

Texas, Ms. Giffords of Arizona, and Mr. Bartlett of Maryland.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with
the reading. Without objection, it is so ordered. And I recognize my-
self for five minutes to explain the amendment.

Following on the witness testimony at the Subcommittee hearing
as well as feedback from several outside groups with interest in the
bill,  this  managers  amendment  makes  the  following  changes.
ARPA–E’s  mission  now  includes  reducing  greenhouse  gases,  im-
proving  energy  efficiency,  ensuring  the  Nation’s  economic  competi-
tiveness in the field of emerging energy technologies as well as de-
creasing  reliance  on  foreign  energy;  clarifies  that  ARPA–E  should
conduct research through hybrid teams of participants from private
industry  and  government  and  university  researchers  and  may  in-
clude  all  stages  of  innovation  from  directed  basic  research  to  late
stage commercial scale type demonstrations.

Furthermore,  the  amendment  ensures  an  innovative  culture  at
ARPA–E by translating some of the critical organizational elements
that  made  DARPA  successful,  such  as  autonomy  within  DOE,  a
hierarchical  reporting  structure,  the  ability  to  start  up  and  termi-
nate  programs  quickly,  hiring  of  talented  program  managers  for
relatively  short  terms,  minimal  bureaucracy  and  overhead  costs,
utilizing  existing  DOE  resources  and  ensuring  current  activities
are not duplicated.

Making  customers  within  the  Federal  Government  to  aid  limits
the  amount  of  funds  that  might  be  spent  internally  within  DOE
and on expensive late stage demonstrations. More importantly, the
amendment makes what many of us consider to be a realistic com-
mitment to increased funding for energy research and development.
Energy  research  and  development  is  not  cheap  but  we  have  been
acting  like  it  is.  We  simply  have  to  fund  ARPA–E  at  a  level  com-
mensurate with the scale and complexity of the challenge.

Is there further discussion? I would like to—I would at this time

ask Mr. Bartlett if he has any comments.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Well,  I  concur  with  the  managers  amendment.  It
has  improved  what  was  a  good  bill.  I  am  happy  to  support  it.
Thank you very much.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett. And I would recog-
nize  Ms.  Giffords.  Any  comments?  Do  you  want  to  be  recognized?

Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.
Chairman LAMPSON. You are recognized for five minutes.
Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you.  I  will  speak  quickly.  My  nickname  is
Gabby for a reason. Let me just say that I thought that the ARPA–
E  hearing  that  we  had  a  couple  weeks  ago  and  unfortunately  was
at  a  time  when  most  Members  were  not  here  was  one  of  the  most
interesting  hearings  that  I  have  ever  been  able  to  partake  in  here
at Congress. We had a chance to hear from Dr. William Bonvillian
who  took  the  DARPA  concept  and  incorporated  it  into  the  Home-
land  Security  bill.  We  had  Dr.  John—or  excuse  me,  Mr.  John
Denniston  who  is  a  venture  capitalist;  Dr.  Steven  Forrest  who

talked  about  the  university’s  effort  for  a  DARPA-like  funding
project for energy; and Dr. Van Atta.

Three  areas  that  were  repeated  over  and  over  in  terms  of  what
we need to do as a nation: energy independence, competitiveness—
that Americans are competitive, and looking at global warming. So
when  I—when  we  heard  about  what  ARPA–E  could  accomplish—
this  breakthrough  technology.  We  are  not  talking  about  making
coal cleaner or nuclear safer. We are talking about those innovative
cutting-edge types of technology. And this bill really pulls it all to-
gether, Mr. Chairman. So with that I am pleased to co-sponsor this
amendment and I ask my colleagues for support.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Giffords follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE GABRIELLE GIFFORDS

I move to strike the last word.
I  am  very  pleased  to  co-sponsor  this  amendment  with  Chairman  Lampson,  and

I am proud to support this important legislation.

Two  weeks  ago,  we  hosted  an  excellent  panel  of  witnesses  who  provided  us  with
a  number  of  suggestions  for  improving  H.R.  364.  Our  amendment  incorporates  a
number of these suggestions and clarifies the structure envisioned for this new orga-
nization within the Department of Energy (DOE).

Our witnesses all supported the establishment of ARPA–E as a new organization
with  limited  administration  and  emphasized  the  important  role  of  program  man-
agers  in  fostering  a  creative,  dynamic  environment.  The  witnesses  also  emphasized
the need for ARPA–E to engage in energy research at all stages of technology devel-
opment  and  to  search  for  better  processes  as  well  as  better  products.  Our  amend-
ment provides direction to project managers consistent with this advice.

The  witnesses  all  supported  funding  levels  for  ARPA–E  above  those  established
in the original bill. The authorization levels are raised to reflect their recommenda-
tions.

ARPA–E  is  intended  to  jump-start  the  transformation  of  breakthroughs  in  basic
energy  research  into  new  fuels,  processes  and  energy  technologies  that  will  make
us  more  energy  efficient,  less  dependent  upon  foreign  sources  of  energy,  and  that
will be less harmful to the environment.

I  believe  that  energy  independence  is  the  Apollo  mission  of  our  generation,  and

ARPA–E will help us achieve this goal.

DOE  has  done  and  will  continue  to  do  good  research  through  its  existing  R&D
programs.  But  DOE  has  not  been  very  successful  in  the  important  task  of  moving
its research from the laboratory bench to the marketplace.

The establishment of an organization like ARPA–E within DOE can influence the
culture of DOE in a positive way. It can provide a path for more of the basic energy
research at DOE to be applied in new ways. We must be willing to experiment with
different  models  of  technology  development  especially  when  we  know  from  experi-
ence  that  we  are  not  seeing  the  pace  of  technological  advance  that  we  want  and
need under the current model for energy R&D.

We face a significant challenge in transforming the pattern of energy use that we
have  followed  in  past  decades.  We  must  make  a  significant  investment  in  energy
R&D if we are going to meet this challenge. The investments we make must support
a  wide  range  of  ideas,  foster  creative  thinking,  and  support  the  development  and
demonstration of new technologies in partnerships with the industry.

H.R.  364  will  get  us  started  in  this  effort  and  provide  us  with  the  future  energy
technologies that we need to support a vibrant economy and the quality of life that
we enjoy today.

I urge my colleagues to support our amendment and to support H.R. 364.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  always  thought
that  Gabby  meant  that  you  talked  a  lot,  not  just  fast.  Who  else
seeks recognition? Ms. Biggert.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  move  to  strike  the

Chairman LAMPSON. You are recognized for five minutes.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  In  the  spirit  of  full  disclosure  I  will  admit  that  I
do  not  support  this  bill  in  its  current  form.  While  I  believe  there

last word.

are a number of provisions in the managers amendment that make
it  less  objectionable,  there  are  a  number  of  provisions  that  make
it  more  objectionable.  First,  the  managers  amendment  I  think  has
a  lot  of  contradictions.  The  managers  amendment  clarifies  that
ARPA–E  should  support  all  stages  of  technology  development  in-
cluding  research  development,  demonstration  and  commercializa-
tion  and  should  not  have  authority  over  any  other  program  at
DOE.

At  the  same  time,  I  think  the  managers  amendment  specifies
that  ARPA–E  should  not  duplicate  the  efforts  of  any  other  agency
or  program  at  DOE.  As  a  result,  the  managers  amendment  seem-
ingly  directs  ARPA–E  to  do  everything  but  not  anything  that  has
already  been  done  at  DOE.  I  got  the  impression  from  the  Sub-
committee  hearing  on  ARPA–E  two  weeks  ago  that  ARPA–E  is
supposed  to  fill  a  niche  and  bridge  the  gap  between  basic  and  ap-
plied  research  efforts  and  I  do  not  see  how  the  bill  or  this  amend-
ment accomplishes that or does what we really want it to.

And by further broadening the responsibilities of the director, we
could  be  creating  tremendous  management  challenges  for  program
managers  both  within  and  outside  of  ARPA–E  as  well  as  for  the
Secretary of Energy.

Secondly, I have real concerns that this managers amendment al-
most doubles the authorized funding for ARPA–E from $3.3 billion
to  $6.4  billion  for  a  brand  new  untested  agency.  And  DARPA,  de-
spite  being  in  one  form  or  another  since  1958,  has  a  fiscal  year
2007 budget of only $3 billion, yet the managers amendment would
make  ARPA–E  in  only  its  second  year  of  existence  one-third  the
size of DARPA and one-forth the size of the Office of Science.

The  managers  amendment  ignores  I  think  the  advice  of  one  of
the  witnesses  at  the  Subcommittee  hearing  two  weeks  ago  who
warned  that  if  ARPA–E  is  stood  up  and  requires  funding  com-
parable  to  DARPA’s,  however  it  would  be  operated  at  a  far  larger
scale  and  its  market  interventions  would  affect  competitive  out-
comes and this could be a problem. That was Mr. Bonvillian.

I  just  do  not  see  how  an  agency  could  wisely  spend  $1  billion  in
its  second  year  of  existence.  But  you  might  find  some  project  that
will  change  the  world.  And  I  think  currently  if  the  DOE  had  an
extra $1 billion in new money they should be spending it on energy
research,  especially  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy,  energy
conservation and nuclear energy research.

And finally, I believe that one of the problems is that there is no
way  to  address  the  relationship  between  this  ARPA–E  and  the  ex-
isting DOE National Laboratories. And again, we talked about the
definition  a  little  bit,  but  the  managers  amendment  specifically
says  that  no  more  than  half  the  funds  may  be  used  for  late  stage
demonstrations. No more than eight percent may go directly to fed-
eral  funded  research  and  development  centers.  And  I  think  even
though  they  might  take  the—if  they  could  take  the  lead—if  they
could, only eight percent can go to them. So—and in testimony, one
witness  stated  that  to  create  an  effective  ARPA–E,  one  of  the  ele-
ments  that  Congress  would  need  to  address  is  DOE’s  existing  lab
structure. And he said, and I quote, ‘‘ARPA–E will need to contend
with a research infrastructure in the national laboratories that had
no  such  precedent  in  DOD.  The  service  R&D  structure  lacked  the

97

scale and scope of the current energy labs and also the support on
Capitol  Hill  that  these  labs  have  had.’’  But  instead  of  addressing
these  issues,  I  think  the  managers  amendment  limits  the  amount
of  funds  that  can  go  to  the  federal  research  and  development.  And
more  than  that,  I  think  that  the  managers  amendment  also  limits
how much could be spent on the demonstration activities, that this
bill  is  supposed  to  create  an  agile  organization  as  the  Gathering
Storm report recommends. I am not clear why we are already put-
ting  limits  on  how  much  can  be  spent  on  something  like  dem-
onstration  projects.  For  all  we  know,  given  all  the  years  of  energy
research  Congress  has  funded,  there  may  be  a  backlog  of  tech-
nologies  that  need  demonstrating  at  this  point,  so—and  I  am  glad
that the Chairman has said that, you know, to take a couple weeks
to  really  look  at  this  and  I  would  love  to  discuss  it  more.  So  with
that I would yield back the balance of my time.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Biggert follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JUDY BIGGERT

In  the  spirit  of  full  disclosure,  I  will  admit  that  I  do  not  support  this  bill  in  its
current form. And while I believe there are a number of provisions in the manager’s
amendment  that  make  it  less  objectionable,  there  are  a  number  of  provisions  that
make it more objectionable.

First, the manager’s amendment seems to be full of contradictions.
The  manager’s  amendment  clarifies  that  ARPA–E  should  support  all  stages  of
technology development—including research, development, demonstration, and com-
mercialization—and should not have authority over any other program at DOE.

At  the  same  time,  the  manager’s  amendment  specifies  that  ARPA–E  should  not

duplicate the efforts of any other agency or program at DOE.

As  a  result,  the  manager’s  amendment  seemingly  directs  ARPA–E  to  do  every-

thing, but not anything that’s already being done at DOE.

I  got  the  impression  from  the  Subcommittee  hearing  on  ARPA–E  two  weeks  ago
that  ARPA–E  is  supposed  to  fill  a  niche,  and  ‘‘bridge  the  gap’’  between  basic  and
applied  research  efforts.  I  don’t  see  how  the  bill,  or  this  amendment,  accomplishes
that.

And  by  further  broadening  the  responsibilities  of  the  director,  we  could  be  cre-
ating  tremendous  management  challenges  for  program  managers  both  within  and
outside of ARPA–E as well as for the Secretary of Energy.

Secondly, I have real concerns that this manager’s amendment almost doubles the
authorized  funding  for  ARPA–E  from  $3.3  billion  to  $6.4  billion  for  a  brand  new,
untested agency.

DARPA,  despite  existing  in  one  form  or  another  since  1958,  has  an  FY07  budget
of  only  around  $3  billion.  Yet,  the  manager’s  amendment  would  make  ARPA–E—
in  only  its  second  year  of  existence—one-third  the  size  of  DARPA,  and  one-fourth
the size of the DOE Office of Science.

This manager’s amendment ignores the advice of one of the witnesses at the Sub-

committee hearing on ARPA–E two weeks ago who warned that:

‘‘If an ARPA–E, is stood up and acquires funding comparable to DARPA’s, how-
ever,  it  would  be  operating  at  a  far  larger  scale  and  its  market  interventions
could  affect  competitive  outcomes.  This  could  be  a  problem.’’  (Mr.  William
Bonvillian)

I  just  don’t  see  how  any  agency  could  wisely  spend  $1  billion  in  its  second  year
of existence, especially an agency still trying to figure out how best to operate with-
in a complex organization like the DOE.

Nor can I even imagine where that money would come from. Don’t we think that
if the DOE currently had an extra $1 billion in new money today they’d be spending
it  on  energy  research,  especially  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy,  energy  con-
servation, and nuclear energy research?

Finally,  of  this  bill’s  many  flaws,  I  believe  that  one  of  its  greatest  is  that  it  in
no way addresses the relationship between this new ARPA–E and the existing DOE
national laboratories.

Again,  in  testimony  before  this  subcommittee,  one  witness  stated  that  to  create
an  effective  ARPA–E,  one  of  the  elements  that  Congress  would  need  to  address  is
DOE’s existing lab structure. He said:

‘‘ARPA–E  will  need  to  contend  with  a  research  infrastructure  in  the  National
Laboratories,  that  had  no  such  precedent  in  DOD.  The  Service  R&D  structure
lacked  the  scale  and  scope  of  the  current  ‘‘energy  labs’’  and  also  the  support  on
Capitol Hill that these labs have.’’ (Dr. Richard Van Atta)

But instead of addressing these issues, the manager’s amendment arbitrarily lim-
its the amount of funds that can go to federal funded research and development cen-
ters, of which the DOE labs are a rather small subset.

But  more  than  that,  the  manager’s  amendment  also  limits  how  much  could  be
spent on demonstration activities. If this bill is supposed to create an ‘‘agile’’ organi-
zation  as  the  Gathering  Storm  report  recommends,  I’m  not  clear  why  we’re  already
putting limits on how much it can spend on something like demonstration projects.
For all we know, given all the years of energy research Congress has funded, there
may be a backlog of technologies that need demonstrating at this point.

For  all  these  reasons,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  oppose  the  manager’s  amendment,

and I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  thank  the  gentlelady.  Who  else  seeks  rec-

ognition? Ranking Member Mr. Inglis.

Mr. INGLIS. Hello, Mr. Chairman. Do you think we have time?
Chairman  LAMPSON.  We  are  getting  close,  but  we  can—we  have
got  a  few  more  minutes  if  we  can—if  there  is  not  too  much  more
that——

Mr. INGLIS. Yeah.
Chairman LAMPSON.—is taken.
Mr. INGLIS. Several questions and it would be great if Chairman
Gordon  would  maybe  respond  to  some  of  these  perhaps  as  I  want
to  make  sure  I  understand  the  organizational  structure  of  ARPA–
E.

Chairman  GORDON.  Let  me  make  a  suggestion,  here.  This  is  an
important bill. I do not want to rush you through it. And so if you
are  going  to  have  several  questions,  maybe  we  should  just  come
back later because——

Mr. INGLIS. Okay.
Chairman GORDON.—you deserve——
Mr. INGLIS. That sounds good.
Chairman GORDON.—to have a full airing.
Mr. INGLIS. Let us do it.
Chairman GORDON. Okay.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Okay.  And  if  that  is  the  case,  pursuant  to
Rule  1J,  the  Subcommittee  will  be  in  recess  until  immediately  fol-
lowing the series of votes on the Floor and ask that everyone please
come back quickly thereafter. We are in recess.

[Recess.]
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Okay.  We  will  reconvene  our  meeting.
Thanks  for  everyone’s  patience  while  we  had  so  many  votes.  We
left while still having discussion on the first amendment. And I be-
lieve that Mr. Inglis was controlling the time and so you are recog-
nized for five minutes.

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  realize  that  people  want  to  move  along  quickly,  so
I  will—these  questions  may  be  just  things  that  Chairman  Gordon
may want to respond to now or it may be that you want to respond
as we move from here to Full Committee markup, but—I am inter-
ested  in  making  sure  that  what—that  we  have—I  have  mentioned
earlier,  learning  what  we  learn  from  NSF.  But  maybe  the  better

comparison  in  talking  with  Mr.  Lipinski  on  the  floor  here  recently
is that DARPA may be actually the better comparison as to wheth-
er  we  have  learned—my  question  is  whether  we  have  learned  ev-
erything we need to learn from DARPA and can apply it to this bill
so that whatever structures were set up for DARPA we have mim-
icked them in this.

And  so  for  example,  within—that  is  the  broad  question.  Specific
questions under that would be what is the organizational structure
that  is  anticipated  for  ARPA–E.  Where  are  they  going  to  get  the
money?  How  is  it  going  to  be  appropriated?  What  Subcommittee
appropriations will that come through? Or will it come through the
DOE  and  therefore  perhaps  DOE  will  take  the  money  and  put  it
somewhere  else?  Or  how  is  it  preserved  for  ARPA–E?  And  then—
so  those  are  just  the  questions  about—I  think  they  fall  under  the
heading of have we learned everything we could learn from DARPA
and  applied  it  to  ARPA–E  and  built  it  in  to  the  authorizing  lan-
guage.

Particularly  I  have  heard—I  am  asking  a  bunch  of  questions
here, but I have also heard in the break for those votes, my capable
staff  found  out  that  NSF  maybe  is  not  so  much  statutory  setup  as
it  is  the  culture  and  expectation  that  has  come  around  NSF  as  to
how  it  will  be  preserved  from  earmarking  and  that  sort  of  thing.
So  my  question  with  the  ARPA–E  is,  in  a  different  world  now
where  earmarking  is  so  common,  do  we  need  to  build  protection
into  this  authorizing  language?  So  you  can  pick  up  any  of  those
questions,  Mr.  Gordon.  And  also  the  last  one  I  throw  out  is  how
do  we  get  from  three  billion  to  six  billion?  Any  one  of  those  three
broad questions.

Chairman  GORDON.  Those  are  all  good  questions.  Let  me  start
with our review of DARPA. There has been an exhaustive effort to
talk with folks in DARPA, folks that have—you know, that are cur-
rently  there,  have  been  there.  We  have  had  hearings  with  the
DARPA  representatives.  And  it  was  an  effort  to  incorporate  that.
I  will  also  say  that,  as  I  said  earlier,  there  are  some  that  think  of
old DARPA and new DARPA. The old DARPA took risks. The new
DARPA  does  not  take  that  many  risks  now.  So  we  tried  to  model
it  more  on  the  old  DARPA.  So  I  think  there  has  been  a  good  con-
versation with them.

In concerning the appropriation amount, the authorizing amount,
that is the amount that was recommended by the Rising Above the
Gathering Storm report. And again, I put that in context, we have
had an 85 percent reduction in Energy R&D since the ’80s.

Are there other more specific questions or do you want to repeat
anything specifically that I did not cover there that you would like?
Mr.  INGLIS.  How  do  you  see  us?  Do  you  think  we  need  to  build
protections into the authorizing language to keep it from morphing
into  a  middling  Department  of  Energy  program  where  things  are
earmarked away and where the budget gets spent and——

Chairman  GORDON.  You  know,  if  the  gentleman  would  yield.  As
I said earlier, I am adamantly opposed to that. As a practical mat-
ter,  ARPA–E  really  is  only  going  to  be  dealing  with—and  this  is
something we learned from DARPA. They said you should limit the
number  of  projects  to  eight  to  10.  So  if  you  are  only  going  to  have
eight  or  10  projects,  you  know,  you  cannot—to  earmark  something

is  like  10  percent  or  more  of  that.  So  I  welcome  any  thoughts  on
being  more  specific  as  to  why  that,  you  know,  why  that  would  be
bad.  So  if  you  have  some  ways  to  do  it—I  do  not  think  it  is  going
to  happen.  I  think  that  it  would  be  an  outrage  to  try  to  do  some-
thing  like  that  because  there  would  be  such  an  enormous  figure.
Mr.  INGLIS.  My  time  is  nearly  up  and  I  want  to  make  sure  to
give  others  here  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions.  But  I  look  for-
ward to working with you as we move from this markup to the Full
Committee and maybe address some of these things in more detail
there.

Chairman  GORDON.  Yeah.  You  know,  as  a  practical  matter,  this
bill has been out for a long time. But I understand we are all busy
and  a  lot  of  times  we  do  not  start  focusing  until—you  know,  like
homework  is  due.  And  so  homework  is  due  now  and  now  that  ev-
erybody  is  focusing  we  will  intensely  go  through  this  in  the  next
two  weeks  and  if  it  takes  longer,  we  will  do,  you  know,  whatever
we need to do.

Mr. INGLIS. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  Who  seeks  recogni-

tion? Ms. Biggert, you are recognized for five minutes.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you.  I  would  go  back  to  the  DARPA  and
also the Homeland Security. It seems to me that the difference be-
tween  DARPA  and  ARPA–E  is  that  DARPA  was  established  to  be
the research arm of the Department of Defense. And we do not, in
ARPA–E, we already have the research. And also, if you could just
answer—obviously  the  Homeland  Security  ARPA  did  not  work,
dealing  with  private—if  you  could  comment  on  the  difference  be-
tween ARPA–E and the Homeland Security.

Chairman  GORDON.  Let  me  first  go  back  to  your  first  question
with the Defense Department. The Defense Department had—they
were  already  doing  research.  ARPA–E  was  set  up  specifically  for
advanced  research.  So  it  was  not  a  new—I  mean,  it  was  not  that
Defense had not done any research. It was set up for advanced re-
search  for  many  of  the  same  reasons  that  we  are  talking  about
today in terms of problems that could occur within the bureaucracy
of the Department of Energy.

In terms of the Homeland Security, I do not know that there are
problems  there.  And  there  may  be.  And  I  cannot  address  that  be-
cause I am just not aware. Is counsel or anyone else aware of that?
Ms. BIGGERT. The witnesses spoke on—one of the witnesses, Mr.
Bonvillian,  spoke  on  the  problems  at  HS–ARPA  and  that  it  was
largely  an  issue  of  execution  of  the  authorization  language,  that
one of the things was that it could not build in the culture like we
are talking about here.

I yield back.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Who  seeks  recognition?  If  there  is  no  fur-
ther discussion on this amendment then the vote will occur on the
amendment.  And  I  would  ask  that  all  in  favor  say  aye.  Those  op-
posed say no.

The  ayes  have  it  and  the  amendment  is  agreed  to.  The  second
amendment  on  the  roster  is  an  amendment  offered  by  the  gentle-
woman  from  Illinois,  Ms.  Biggert.  Are  you  ready  to  proceed  with
your amendment?

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have  an  amendment  at  the

desk.

Chairman LAMPSON. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The CLERK. Amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 364

offered by Mrs. Biggert of Illinois.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with
the  reading  and  without  objection  it  is  so  ordered.  I  recognize  Ms.
Biggert for five minutes to explain the amendment.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  should  come  as  no
surprise  to  everyone  on  this  subcommittee  that  I  have  long  been
skeptical  about  the  National  Academy’s  proposal  to  create  an  Ad-
vanced  Research  Project  Agency  at  DOE,  or  ARPA–E.  And  I  first
raised  questions  about  this  proposal  at  a  Science  Committee  hear-
ing  that  we  had  in  the  109th  Congress  in  March  of  2006.  And  de-
spite participating in a second hearing just two weeks ago, I think
that  many  of  the  questions  have  not  been  answered.  It  still  is  not
clear  what  problems  we  are  trying  to  solve  with  the  creation  of
ARPA–E  or  what  its  function,  role,  or  structure  should  be.  So  is  it
a lack of private sector involvement in long-term or basic research?
And  if  so,  how  do  we  solve  the  problem  by  creating  a  brand  new
agency  to  distribute  scarce  federal  resources  to  companies  to  con-
duct research that they would not otherwise conduct.

Correct  me  if  I  am  wrong,  but  does  not  the  academy’s  version  of
ARPA–E  put  the  Federal  Government  in  the  position  of  picking
what companies are the winners. It is a lack of federal funding for
high  risk  transformational  research?  And  if  so,  how  would  you
characterize  DOE’s  current  FreedomCAR  and  hydrogen  initiatives,
for example. How about the President’s global nuclear energy part-
nership,  FutureGen,  or  U.S.  participation  in  either.  I  do  not  know
about my colleagues, but I would put these in the category of high
risk transformational research.

Is it a failure of the Department of Energy to effectively transfer
new energy technologies from the laboratory to the market? And if
so,  would  not  it  make  more  sense  to  closely  examine  the  legal  and
policy obstacles to the transfer of technology from our universities,
national  labs,  and  other  research  institutions?  And  how  should
ARPA  be  structured  to  take  full  advantage  of  the  existing  energy
R&D infrastructure of our national labs?

Where  exactly  are  we  going  to  get  the  money  for  ARPA–E  with
growing  demands  on  our  limited  federal  resources?  Is  there  really
new  money  available  for  this  agency?  Really,  no.  The  money  will
come  from  other  basic  and  applied  DOE  research  programs,  I  am
afraid.

So  some  of  these  questions  are  included  in  this  amendment  that
I  am  offering  today.  Instead  of  creating  a  new  agency,  a  new  bu-
reaucracy  at  the  DOE  based  on  what  I  think  is  a  vague  rec-
ommendation  by  the  National  Academies.  My  amendment  would
direct  the  NSA  to  conduct  a  detailed  study  and  clarify  their  rec-
ommendation  to  establish  an  ARPA–E  and  to  answer  a  number  of
remaining  questions.  And  I  think  this  is  a  reasonable  and  respon-
sible course of action on the only Gathering Storm recommendation
in which there was not consensus.

And  on  the  National  Academy’s  panel—and  the  panel  said—
sought  no  outside  advice  in  crafting.  At  the  hearing  on  ARPA–E

102

held  by  this  subcommittee  two  weeks  ago,  I  specifically  asked  the
witnesses if they thought the NAS recommendation was clear as to
the extent of the function, role and structure of ARPA–E or if they
believed  that  the  recommendation  left  a  lot  of  questions  unan-
swered.  And  I  think  the  panel  was  unanimous  that  the  NAS  rec-
ommendation was really just an idea that left a lot of questions un-
answered.

One  of  the  witnesses,  John  Denniston,  said  I  do  not  think  that
the  Gathering  Storm  report  provided  implementation  details.  I
view it as an idea. So they do not talk specifically about what tech-
nologies,  fossil,  nuclear,  renewable—they  do  not  talk  about  the
stage  of  research.  Should  it  be  translational?  Is  it  basic?  Is  it  ap-
plied? And they do not talk about the organizational details, much
of which you have heard today.

And  when  I  asked  the  same  witnesses  if  it  would  be  worthwhile
for  NAS  to  answer  some  of  those  unanswered  questions,  come  to
a  consensus  and  flesh  out  the  details  of  whether  the  ARPA–E  rec-
ommendation before Congress went so far as to create another fed-
eral  agency,  they  said  no.  So  while  they  all  agreed  that  the  rec-
ommendation was vague, they all thought we should go ahead and
implement it anyway.

While  those  witnesses  certainly  are  entitled  to  their  opinion,  we
all  have  a  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  Federal  Government  is
a  good  steward  of  the  taxpayers’  dollars.  And  I  am  not  willing  to
spend  billions  of  dollars  to  create  a  whole  new  agency  based  on  a
vague  recommendation.  I  know,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  you  have
spent  a  lot  more  time  on  this  in  moving  it  forward.  But  I  have  al-
ways  taken  my  responsibility  for  overseeing  the  research  and  de-
velopment programs at the DOE very seriously. And I cannot think
really  of  anything  more  important  to  our  national  security,  our
economy, and our standard of living than energy. And I know that
everyone here is generally interested in finding solutions to our na-
tion’s energy challenges. And I think we need to find the right solu-
tion, not just any solution.

And if ARPA–E is the right solution, I will support it. But to get
to  the  right  solution,  I  think  we  have  the  obligation  to  ask  the
tough  questions.  And  that  is  the  purpose  of  my  amendment  today.
So I would urge my colleagues to support it and yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JUDY BIGGERT

It  should  come  as  no  surprise  to  anyone  on  this  subcommittee  that  I  have  long
been skeptical about the National Academies’ (NAS) proposal to create an Advanced
Research  Projects  Agency  at  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  or  ARPA–E.  I  first
raised  questions  about  this  proposal  at  a  Science  Committee  hearing  during  the
109th Congress in March of 2006.

Despite  participating  in  a  second  hearing  on  this  topic  just  two  weeks  ago,  many

of my questions still have not been answered.

It  still  isn’t  clear  what  problems  we  are  trying  to  solve  with  the  creation  of  an

ARPA–E, nor what its function, role or structure should be.

Is it a lack of private sector investment in long-term or basic research? If so, how
do we solve the problem by creating a brand new agency to distribute scarce federal
resources  to  companies  to  conduct  research  they  wouldn’t  otherwise  conduct?  Cor-
rect me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t the Academies’ version of ARPA–E put the Federal
Government in the position of picking what companies are winners?

Is it a lack of federal funding for high-risk, transformational research? If so, how
would you characterize DOE’s current FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Initiatives? How
about  the  President’s  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership,  FutureGen,  or  U.S.  par-
ticipation in ITER, the international fusion experiment? I don’t know about my col-
leagues,  but  I  would  put  these  in  the  category  of  high-risk,  transformational  re-
search.

Is  it  a  failure  by  the  Department  of  Energy  to  effectively  transfer  new  energy
technologies  from  the  laboratory  to  the  market?  If  so,  wouldn’t  it  make  more  sense
to  closely  examine  the  legal  and  policy  obstacles  to  the  transfer  of  technology  from
our universities, national laboratories, and other research institutions?

And how should ARPA–E be structured to take full advantage of the existing en-
ergy  R&D  infrastructure  at  our  national  labs?  Where  exactly  are  we  going  to  get
the  money  for  ARPA–E?  With  growing  demands  on  our  limited  federal  resources,
is  there  really  ‘‘new  money’’  available  for  this  agency?  Realistically,  no;  the  money
will come from other basic and applied DOE research programs.

Some  of  these  questions  are  included  in  this  amendment  I  am  offering  today.  In-
stead of creating a new agency—a new bureaucracy—at the DOE based on a vague
recommendation  by  the  National  Academies,  my  amendment  would  direct  the  NAS
to  conduct  a  detailed  study  of  and  clarify  their  recommendation  to  establish  an
ARPA–E, and to answer a number of remaining questions.

I think this is a reasonable and responsible course of action on the only Gathering
Storm  recommendation  on  which  there  was  not  consensus,  and  on  which  the  Na-
tional Academies’ panel sought no outside advice in crafting.

At  the  hearing  on  ARPA–E  held  by  this  subcommittee  two  weeks  ago,  I  specifi-
cally  asked  the  witnesses  if  they  thought  the  NAS  recommendation  was  clear  as  to
the  exact  function,  role,  and  structure  of  ARPA–E,  or  if  they  believed  the  rec-
ommendation left a lot of questions unanswered. The panel was unanimous that the
NAS  recommendation  was  really  just  an  ‘‘idea’’  that  left  a  lot  of  questions  unan-
swered.

One  of  the  witnesses,  John  Denniston,  a  partner  with  the  firm  Kleiner,  Perkins,
Caufield & Byers, said, ‘‘I don’t think that the Gathering Storm report provided im-
plementation  details.  I  view  it  as  an  idea.  So,  they  don’t  talk  specifically  about
which  technologies,  fossil,  nuclear,  renewable.  They  don’t  talk  about  stage  of  re-
search,  should  it  be  translational,  is  it  basic,  is  it  applied?  They  don’t  talk  about
the organizational details, much of which you have heard today.’’

When I asked the same witnesses if it would be worthwhile for the NAS to answer
some  these  unanswered  questions,  come  to  a  consensus,  and  flesh  out  the  details
of  their  ARPA–E  recommendation  before  Congress  went  so  far  as  to  create  another
federal agency, they said no.

So  while  they  all  agreed  the  recommendation  was  vague,  they  all  thought  we

should go ahead and implement it anyway.

While those witnesses certainly are entitled to their opinion, we all have a respon-
sibility  to  ensure  that  the  Federal  Government  is  a  good  steward  of  the  taxpayer’s
dollars. And I’m not willing to spend billions of dollars to create a whole new agency
based on a vague recommendation.

As past Chairman of this subcommittee, I always took my responsibility for over-
seeing  the  research  and  development  programs  at  the  DOE  very  seriously.  I  can’t
think  of  anything  more  important  to  our  national  security,  our  economy,  and  our
standard  of  living  than  energy.  And  I  know  everyone  here  is  genuinely  interested
in finding solutions to our nation’s energy challenges.

But we need to find the ‘‘right’’ solutions, not just any solution. If ARPA–E is the
right solution, I will support it. But to get to the ‘‘right’’ solution, we have an obliga-
tion to ask tough questions. That’s the purpose of my amendment today. I urge my
colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman LAMPSON. I thank the gentlelady. Is there——
Chairman GORDON. Strike the last word.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  Chairman  of  the  Committee  is  recog-

nized. Mr. Gordon.

Chairman  GORDON.  You  cover  a  lot  of  territory  there,  Ms.
Biggert.  Let  me  try  to  address  some  of  these.  First  of  all,  you  said
that this was not a consensus recommendation of the Rising Above
the Gathering Storm. It was consensus. It was not unanimous. The
only member of the community that voted against it was the Chair-
man of the Board of Exxon.

You quoted Mr. Denniston as being somehow negative toward it.
You  asked  him  some  questions  in  the—when  there  was  a  Sub-
committee hearing. Let me repeat back to you his answer. And Mr.
Denniston  said  and  this  is  in  response  to  you,  ‘‘Can  I  take  a  shot
at  that,  Congresswoman?  First  is  on  the  question  of  the  study.  I
will not do—I would not do a study. I think this subcommittee has
the  facts  and  the  expertise  to  be  able  to  decide  those  details.  A
study delays implementation, which I would be very much opposed
to.  And  let  me  also  say  that  it  is  also  not  necessary  to  have  this
amendment because it is already the law.’’

The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  Section  1821,  DOE  was  required
to  have  a  similar  study  done  by  the  National  Academy  of  Public
Administration  and  submit  it  to  Congress  by  January  of  this  year.
DOE never initiated the report. So it is pretty clear that if you are
against  this  developing  ARPA–E  then  you  should  vote  for  this
amendment  because  it,  you  know—somebody  might  even  make  a
commentary  that  DOE  couldn’t  even  do  what  they  are  required  to
do.  And  this  may  be  a  reason  why  we  want  to  set  up  something
separately.  But  if  you  want  the  study  all  you  have  to  do  is  ask
DOE  to  do  what  they  were  required  to  do  and  have  not  done.  I
yield back.

Ms. BIGGERT. If the gentleman will yield.
Chairman GORDON. Oh, certainly.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  think  I  did  make  it  clear  that  they  all  rec-
ommended that we go ahead and not wait for any study. I tried to
briefly say that.

Chairman GORDON. Well, I apologize if I——
Ms. BIGGERT. No, that is okay.
Chairman GORDON.—mischaracterized.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  That  is  all  right.  I  think  that  one  of  the  problems
with  the  implementation  is  that  I  think  it  is  going  to  be  difficult
when  we  do  not  have  the  buy-in  of  the  Department  of  Energy.
Maybe  to  ask  them  for  doing  a  study.  But  I  would  agree  with  you
that I have also asked them for studies such as this. Systems anal-
ysis  for  the  GNEP.  And  they  refused  that.  They  were  against  the
bill and a study like that. So, I think there are problems.

I  am  not  saying  that  I  agree  with  everything  that  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy  has  done.  But  I  just  wonder  if—again,  I  think  it
is  the  question  of  the  whole  agency.  But  I  think  that  we  can  work
it out at some point. Yield back.

Chairman GORDON. I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Bartlett.
Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much.  You  know,  if  we  were  sit-
ting here five or 10 years ago, I could enthusiastically support this
proposal.  But  very  frankly,  we  have  run  out  of  time.  The  time  for
this was five or 10 years ago. As a matter of fact, the time for this
was 27 years ago.

In  1956,  M.  King  Hubbard  predicted  the  United  States  would
reach its maximum oil production in 1970. That happened right on
schedule.  By  1980,  we  knew  darn  well  that  M.  King  Hubbard  was
right  about  the  United  States.  And  in  spite  of  drilling  more  oil
wells than all the rest of the world put together, in spite of finding
oil  in  Alaska,  in  spite  of  drilling  four  times  as  many  wells  in  the

105

Gulf  of  Mexico  as  all  the  wells  in  Saudi  Arabia,  we  still  are  only
producing half as much oil as we did in 1970.

And  we  knew  darn  well  by  1980  that  M.  King  Hubbard  was
right, which is why I say we should have been doing this 27 years
ago.  Certainly  the  United  States  is  a  microcosm  of  the  world.  He
predicted  that  the  world  would  be  peaking  in  oil  production  about
now.  Have  you  seen  the  latest  Chevron  ad?  They  agree  that  we
probably reached peak production. The time for this study is gone.
We  have  now  run  out  of  time.  We  have  now  run  out  of  energy.  If
we  had  any  extra  surplus  energy  to  invest  in  alternatives,  oil
wouldn’t  be  60-couple  dollars  a  barrel.  We  needed  to  be  doing  this
27  years  ago.  We  cannot  roll  back  the  hands  of  time,  so  we  need
to move.

I would hope that the National Science Foundation and National
Academy  of  Sciences  would  work  with  us  in  developing  this  new
entity  so  that  it  will  be  as  effective  as  it  can  be.  You  know,  time
is really more than of the essence here. I went over during the holi-
days  to  China.  They  start  their  discussion  of  energy  by  talking
about post-oil. Wow. I wish our guys got it here.

They  have  a  five-point  program  which  ought  to  be  our  five-point
program. Conservation first. Diversify. Get as much of it as you can
at home. Be kind to the environment. Surprise that they would say
that.  They  know  that  they  are  huge  polluters  and  they  are  saying
please help us. We have 1,300,000,000 people. They have got to be
fed and clothed. And the fifth one was international cooperation.

It  is  high  time  that  we  get  on  with  this.  It  may  not  work.  But,
you  know,  God  knows  what  we  are  doing  now  sure  as  heck  is  not
working.  Year  by  year  goes  by.  The  price  of  oil  goes  up  more  and
more.  And  I  had  a  map  that  I  wish  I  kept  here  to  show  you—the
world according to oil. And it shows what the countries of the world
would  look  like  if  their  size  was  relative  to  the  amount  of  oil  that
they  have.  We  are  way  over  insignificant  in  a  corner.  And  Saudi
Arabia,  of  course,  just  dominates  the  globe.  And  the  Middle  East
and Northern Africa dominates the globe.

You  know,  it  is  high  time  we  get  on  with  this.  And  the  reason
for  this—the  reason  for  this—and  the  reason  the  marketplace  will
not take care of this and the reason that the DOD could not count
on  the  marketplace  to  take  care  of  the  innovations  they  needed,
which was why they set up DARPA—is because the market signals
will not be early enough or strong enough.

I know I have many colleagues on my side of the yard that wor-
ship the market. They think the market is omniscient and omnipo-
tent. It knows all and is all-powerful. And if there were infinite re-
sources, I could trust the market. The problem is there are not infi-
nite  resources  here  and  our  USGS  and  our  energy  information
agency do not understand that. They project that the future will be
like the past. And in the past we have always had as much gas and
oil  as  we  wanted.  And  they  are  saying  that  our  two  percent  in-
crease  in  growth  is  going  to  continue.  It  is,  and  it  will  be  acceler-
ated  with  China  and  India  and  the  developing  world  coming  on
board. And they say that there will be enough gas and oil there to
meet those demands.

And clearly La Horara says that this is absolutely implausible to
believe  that  we  are  going  to  find  as  much  more  oil  as  all  the  oil

that  now  exists  in  the  world.  And  that  is  what  they  are  telling  us
will  happen.  Mr.  Chairman  and  the  Chairman  of  the  Full  Com-
mittee,  thank  you  very  much  for  bringing  this  before  us.  This  is
more than timely. It would have been timely 17 years ago. It is the
kind  of  thing  we  should  have  been  doing  27  years  ago  and  shame
on us if we do not do it now.

Ms. BIGGERT. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. BARTLETT. Yes. I would be happy to yield.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Okay.  Thank  you.  I  know  that  this  is  something
that  you  really  believe  in  and  I  do  too.  I  wish  that  we  had  started
much earlier. But I do not want to just leave it to imply that there
is  not  any  energy  R&D  underway  currently.  And  the  Department
of  Energy  is  spending  billions  on  energy  R&D  now.  I  think  that—
and this investment I think is paying off.

For instance, the National Academy of Science has found that for
every  dollar  that  Congress  invested  in  energy  efficiency  R&D  be-
tween 1978 and 2000, that more than four dollars of economic ben-
efit  was  realized.  So  I  think  that  we—I  do  not  know  that  this  will
delay  it.  I  think  that  we  have  to  move  as  fast  as  we  can,  too.  And
I certainly do not want to let one minute go by that we do not con-
tinue in the research and development. And with that I would yield
back.

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  yield  back,  Mr.  Chair-

man.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you both very much. Who seeks rec-
ognition?  Any  further  discussion?  Being  none,  the  vote  will  now
occur  on  the  amendment.  All  in  favor  say  aye.  Those  opposed  say
no.

The  nos  have  it  and  the  amendment  is  not  agreed  to.  Are  there
any other amendments? Any other amendments? Hearing none, the
vote is on the bill, H.R. 364, To provide for the establishment of the
Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency-Energy  as  amended.  All  those
in  favor  will  say  aye.  All  those  opposed  will  say  no.  In  the  opinion
of  the  Chair,  the  ayes  have  it.  I  will  recognize  the  Vice  Chairman
of our Subcommittee for a motion.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  move  that  the  Sub-
committee  favorably  report  House  Resolution  364’s  amendment  as
amended to the Full Committee. Furthermore, I move that staff be
instructed  to  prepare  the  Subcommittee  legislative  report  and
make  necessary  technical  and  conforming  changes  to  the  bill  as
amended  in  accordance  with  the  recommendation  of  the  Sub-
committee.

Chairman LAMPSON. The question is on the motion to report the
bill  favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by  saying
aye. Opposed say no. The ayes have it, and the bill is favorably re-
ported. Without objection the motion to reconsider is laid upon the
table.  Subcommittee  Members  may  submit  additional  or  Minority
views on the measure.

I would like to thank the Members for their attendance, everyone
who  stayed  all  the  way  through  this  thing.  And  this  concludes  our
subcommittee markup. We are adjourned. Thank you.

[Whereupon, at 1:00 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF H.R. 364,
TO PROVIDE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY-ENERGY

Summary

H.R. 364 establishes an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy within the
U.S. Department of Energy. Modeled after the Department of Defense’s Defense Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA–E is a new program charged with the mis-
sion of reducing U.S. dependence on oil through the rapid development and commer-
cialization of transformational clean energy technologies. This bill follows on the rec-
ommendations of the National Academy of Sciences’ report ‘‘Rising Above the Gath-
ering  Storm:  Energizing  and  Employing  America  for  a  Brighter  Economic  Future.’’
Section-by-Section
Section 1. Findings

The  U.S.  can  meet  long-term  energy  challenges  through  sustained  investment  in
energy research programs at DOE augmented by an innovative and aggressive new
energy  technology  development  effort  based  on  the  same  operating  principles  that
make DARPA successful.
Section 2. Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy

Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA–E) within the
Department of Energy. Similar to the Department of Defense’s successful Advanced
Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA),  this  new  organizational  structure  will  be  well-
positioned  to  support  revolutionary  and  transformational  energy  research  where
risk and pay-offs are high.

The stated goal of ARPA–E is to reduce the dependence of the U.S. on foreign en-
ergy  sources  by  20  percent  over  the  next  10  years.  To  achieve  this  ARPA–E  should
support  targeted  high-risk,  high  pay-off  research  to  accelerate  the  innovation  cycle
for  both  traditional  and  alternative  energy  sources  and  energy  efficiency.  ARPA–E
shall be headed by a Director, appointed by the Secretary, who will administer com-
petitive  grants,  cooperative  agreements,  or  contracts  to  universities,  industry  and
consortia which may include federal labs.

Organization  of  ARPA–E  will  be  very  flat  and  nimble  to  avoid  bureaucratic  im-
pediments  that  stifle  innovation  today.  The  Director  shall  designate  program  man-
agers  who  will  have  flexibility  in  establishing  R&D  goals  for  the  program,  publi-
cizing goals, issuing solicitations and selecting projects for support as well as moni-
toring  their  progress.  Projects  will  be  chosen  based  on  factors  such  as  novelty,  sci-
entific and technical merit, applicant’s capabilities and other criteria as the Director
determines. ARPA–E will have authority to hire specialized science and engineering
personnel to be program managers. (This is similar to DARPA and HS–ARPA.)

In  addition,  the  Director  shall  ensure  that  ARPA–E’s  activities  are  coordinated
with other federal research agencies and that ARPA–E may carry out projects joint-
ly with other agencies.
Section. 3. Energy Independence Acceleration Fund

Establishes  the  Energy  Independence  Acceleration  Fund  administered  by  the  Di-
rector  of  ARPA–E.  Funding  is  authorized  from  FY  2008  thru  2013  ramping  up  25
percent per year from an initial authorization of $300 million to $915 million.
Section 4. Recoupment

If  a  project  is  successful  the  Federal  Government  can  recoup  some  of  its  original
investment.  The  provision  allows  the  Secretary  complete  flexibility  in  developing
recoupment agreements, and the ability to waive it entirely if necessary for the com-
mercial  viability  of  a  project.  All  recouped  funds  will  be  returned  to  the  Energy
Independence Acceleration Fund.
Section 5. Advisory Committee

The  ARPA–E  Advisory  Committee  may  seek  advice  either  from  an  existing  DOE
advisory  committee  or  may  establish  a  new  advisory  committee.  If  the  Director  of
ARPA–E  requires  industry  advice,  a  panel  to  advise  on  a  specific  technology  area,
or to hire an outside consultant, this provision provides the appropriate authorities.
Section 6. ARPA–E Evaluation

At  the  end  of  five  and  one-half  years,  the  President’s  Committee  on  Science  and
Technology  (PCAST)  shall  evaluate  how  well  ARPA–E  has  performed  in  achieving
its  goals  and  mission.  The  Committee  is  required  to  recommend  whether  ARPA–E
should be continued or terminated as well as lessons learned from its operation.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:10  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Bart  Gordon
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman  GORDON.  Good  morning  everyone.  The  Committee  on
Science and Technology will come to order. Pursuant to notice, the
Committee meets to consider the following measures: H.R. 364, To
provide  for  the  establishment  of  the  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency–Energy;  H.R.  1467,  the  10,000  Trained  by  2010  Act;  H.R.
1716,  the  Green  Energy  Education  of  2007;  and  H.R.  632,  the  H–
Prize Act of 2007.

Before  we  get  started  with  this  markup  though,  we  have  one
quick  piece  of  Committee  business  to  attend  to.  The  distinguished
Member  from  California,  Mr.  Calvert,  recently  took  a  leave  of  ab-
sence from the Committee to serve on Appropriations. This left the
Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee  without  a  Ranking  Member.
Last  week  Mr.  Hall  announced  that  Representative  Feeney  would
take over as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, and I now ask
unanimous consent that the Committee on Science and Technology
ratify the selection of Mr. Feeney as Ranking Member of the Space
and Aeronautics Subcommittee. Without objection——

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  do  you  have  to  be  present  to  be  pro-

posed or——

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  I  am  considering  that  no  objection
and—or  may  I  say,  I  consider  that  a  slight  objection  and  it  is  so
ordered. I want to congratulate Mr. Feeney.

Let  me  also  say  that  Ken  Calvert—I  was  Ranking  Member  of
this  committee  and  Ken  did  much  more  than  I  did.  He  made  an
effort to go to every facility all across the country and became very
knowledgeable and we hope that he will be a continuing asset and
I  am  sure  that  Mr.  Feeney  will  also  do  a  good  job,  but  Ken  did  a
particularly  good  job  and  hopefully  he  will  be  there  on  Appropria-
tions to understand these issues.

We  now  begin  with  the  markup  and  I  will  begin  with  a  brief
statement. Today the Committee is marking up four bills. The first
bill we will consider is a bill that I introduced, H.R. 364, which es-
tablishes the Advanced Research Project Agency for Energy, and in
the  Subcommittee  hearing  and  in  the  markup  we  had  a  very
healthy  discussion  that  I  believe  pointed  to  the  critical  need  for
such an entity. We have worked hard with our friends from across
the aisle, and while there are still a few differences, it has resulted
in  a  better  bill.  It  is  my  understanding  that  this  discussion  will
continue  today  with  a  number  of  amendments,  and  I  look  forward
to addressing those concerns.

The  next  bill  we  will  take  up  is  H.R.  1467,  the  10,000  Trained
by 2010 Act, introduced by Chairman Wu. This is a good bill which
I support. There has been a lot of talking in Washington about the
need to push health care IT forward. Our medical system is far be-
hind  other  sectors  in  the  use  of  information  technology.  However,
it  is  common  knowledge  that  information  technology  could  signifi-
cantly  improve  patient  care  and  reduce  health  care  costs,  and  let
me  just  collaterally  say  that  I  have  just  introduced  H.R.  2406.  It
is  a  health  care  IT  bill  that  will  be  in  the  jurisdiction  of  this  com-
mittee. As I think Mr. Gingerich can tell you, it is going to be wild-
ly  popular  within  the  health  care  area,  doctors,  physicians,  every-
one. Health care IT or IT in the health care area is one of the few
areas  that  hasn’t  really  matured.  It  is  so  popular  that  Newt
Gingerich  and  Hillary  Clinton  are  supporting  this  concept  and  so
I would suggest to all of you to take a look at it. Don’t get involved
if  you  don’t  want  to  but  I  think  you  will  find  that  it  will  be  some-
thing  that  is  going  to  be  a  good  bill  and  will  be  popular  for  you.
And we also have H.R. 1716, the Green Energy Education Act of
2007.  It  was  introduced  by  Mr.  McCaul,  and  H.R.  1716  raises  the
profile of a very important issue, university research and education
on  clean  energy  including  energy  efficiency  and  green  building  de-
sign  and  technologies.  It  would  bring  together  the  Department  of
Energy,  a  mission  agency,  and  the  National  Science  Foundation,
which  has  a  long  history  with  science  and  technological  education,
in  a  common  goal  to  help  educate  the  next  generation  of  energy
technology experts and green building professionals. This bill helps
meet  a  very  important  need,  and  I  thank  Mr.  McCaul  for  bringing
it  to  the  Committee,  and  who  would  have  known  he  would  have
been such a greenie. But we thank you. This is a good bill.

We also will consider Mr. Lipinski’s and Mr. Inglis’ H.R. 362, the
H–Prize  Act  of  2007.  Hydrogen  technology  represents  just  the  type
of transformational possibilities that we are hoping to achieve with
ARPA–E and may some day make an important piece of our energy
puzzle, and I commend our colleagues, Mr. Inglis and Mr. Lipinski,
for working together to make this a good bipartisan bill and I look
forward to moving it through the Committee today.

So these are the four good bills that we have before us and I now
would  like  to  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  present  his  opening  remarks.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Today the Committee is meeting to markup four bills.
The  first  bill  we  will  consider  today  is  a  bill  that  I  introduced,  H.R.  364,  which
establishes an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy. In the Subcommittee

129

hearing  and  markup  we  had  a  very  healthy  discussion  that,  I  believe,  pointed  to
the critical need for such an entity.

We have worked hard with our friends across the aisle. And, while there are still
substantial  differences,  it  has  resulted  in  a  better  bill.  It  is  my  understanding  that
this  discussion  will  continue  today  with  a  number  of  amendments,  and  I  look  for-
ward to addressing your concerns.

The next bill we will take up is H.R. 1467, the 10,000 Trained by 2010 Act intro-

duced by Chairman Wu. This is a good bill which I support.

There  has  been  a  lot  of  talk  in  Washington  about  the  need  to  push  health  care
IT forward. Our medical system is far behind other sectors in the use of information
technology. However, it is common knowledge that information technology could sig-
nificantly improve patient care and reduce health care costs.

While  there  has  been  a  lot  of  discussion  on  the  issue  in  Congress,  not  much  has
actually  been  done.  In  this  case,  Chairman  Wu  and  other  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee  have  identified  one  component  of  the  issue  and  how  the  Science  and  Tech-
nology Committee could make a real and positive contribution in this area.

I  strongly  support  this  legislation  and  would  urge  everyone  on  the  Committee  to

do so as well.

H.R.  1716,  the  Green  Energy  Education  Act  of  2007,  was  reintroduced  by  Mr.
McCaul  this  year  after  having  passed  the  House  as  part  of  a  broader  bipartisan
Science Committee Energy R&D bill at the end of the 109th Congress.

H.R.  1716  raises  the  profile  of  a  very  important  issue—university  research  and
education  on  clean  energy,  including  energy  efficiency  and  green  building  design
and  technologies.  It  would  bring  together  the  Department  of  Energy,  a  mission
agency, and the National Science Foundation, which has a long history with science
and  technology  education,  in  a  common  goal  to  help  educate  the  next  generation  of
energy technology experts and green building professionals.

This  bill  helps  meet  a  very  important  need  and  I  thank  Mr.  McCaul  for  bringing

it to the Committee.

We  will  also  consider  by  Mr.  Lipinski,  H.R.  632,  the  H–Prize  Act  of  2007.  Hydro-
gen technologies represent just the type of transformational possibilities that we are
hoping  to  achieve  with  ARPA–E,  and  may  some  day  make  up  an  important  piece
of our energy puzzle.

I  commend  my  colleagues  Mr.  Inglis  and  Mr.  Lipinski  for  working  together  and
for  working  hard  to  make  this  a  good,  bipartisan  bill.  I  look  forward  to  moving  it
through Committee today.

These  are  four  good  bills,  and  I  strongly  encourage  my  colleagues  to  support  all

of them.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, you and I have been working together
now  for  over  22  years  and  on  the  same  side  of  the  aisle  for  most
of  that  time,  and  if  it  weren’t  for  me  switching  parties  you  might
not  even  be  Chairman  right  now.  And  I  have  been  talked  to  by  4/
5  of  you  bunch  asking  me  to  switch  back.  A  good  group  on  both
sides.  I  appreciate  everybody  on  both  sides  of  the  Chairman  here,
and you can thank me later if you would like.

When  you  work  with  someone  as  long  as  we  have,  not  only  on
this  committee  but  also  on  the  Commerce  Committee—we  are  on
that  Committee  together—there  are  bound  to  be  some  times  when
we  are  going  to  disagree.  And  as  much  as  I  dislike  going  against
my  friend  from  Tennessee,  sometimes  it  just  happens.  As  it  turns
out,  today  is  one  of  those  days.  While  I  commend  you,  Bart,  for
your  efforts  on  behalf  of  boosting  energy  R&D,  I  disagree  with  the
way H.R. 364 does it. I have to say that I have a problem with the
idea  of  creating  a  new  bureaucracy  within  the  Department  of  En-
ergy that will regardless of intention fight for money with existing
and future programs at DOE. With the tight budget parameters we
are working with, I am not comfortable authorizing the creation of
ARPA–E  based  on  a  vague  recommendation  that  was  in  the  Gath-
ering  Storm  report.  The  facts  are  that  DOE  currently  has  the  au-
thority  to  do  ARPA-type  projects  but  DOE  is  woefully  under-fund-
ed. I am concerned that we could be faced with the problem of hav-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00137 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

130

ing  both  the  Office  of  Science  and  ARPA–E  underfunded  so  that
neither of them is operating at full potential if we go forward with
the  creation  of  this  new  agency.  Before  we  go  forward  with  any
ARPA-type  projects,  I  would  like  the  Section  1821  study  in  EPAct
to be completed that looks at the applicability of the DARPA man-
agement  practices  and  the  advisability  of  creating  a  DARPA-type
agency within DOE. Before we move toward this legislation, and to
that  end,  I  will  be  introducing  an  amendment  that,  without  cre-
ating a new bureaucracy, would require the Secretary of Energy to
identify and accelerate advanced research projects at the DOE that
will  address  our  energy  needs.  I,  along  with  several  of  my  col-
leagues, have sent a letter to the Secretary urging him to complete
the  study  as  mandated  by  law  so  that  we  all  might  benefit  from
its recommendations.

In  addition  to  the  letter,  we  also  ask  the  Secretary  to  appoint  a
technology transfer coordinator and establish the technology trans-
fer  working  group.  As  several  of  our  witnesses  testified  to  in  our
committee  hearing,  technology  transfer  plays  a  very  integral  part
in  the  process  from  basic  research  to  widespread  commercializa-
tion.  I  don’t  think  anyone  would  dispute  that  our  country  needs
clean,  affordable,  reliable  energy  that  is  generated  through  re-
search  and  development.  This  committee  should  continue  to  ad-
vance  legislation  that  addresses  our  most  critical  energy  needs  in
a  fiscally  responsible  manner.  To  that  end,  I  will  be  introducing
legislation  by  the  end  of  the  week  that  will  help  accomplish  these
goals.

In  addition  to  the  ARPA–E  legislation,  we  will  also  be  marking
up H.R. 1467, H.R. 1716 and H.R. 632. I am an original co-sponsor
of H.R. 1467, the 10,000 Trained by 2010 Act, and I am supportive
of  the  primary  goal  it  seeks  to  achieve.  If  implemented  correctly
and efficiently, health information technology can revolutionize our
health  care  system  but  we  have  to  have  an  educated  workforce
properly  trained  in  health  IT  in  order  for  it  to  be  successful,  and
this  is  what  H.R.  1467  is  about.  NSF  is  already  doing  work,  yeo-
man’s  work,  in  the  IT  arena,  but  this  measure  will  increase  the
focus on health IT. I encourage my colleagues to support it.

I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  H.R.  1716,  the  Green  Energy
Education Act of 2007, introduced by my fellow Texan, Mr. McCaul.
This  is  a  good  piece  of  legislation.  It  was  voted  out  of  this  com-
mittee in the last Congress. The fact that it has also been included
in  larger  packages  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  in  this  Congress  indi-
cates  its  overwhelming  support.  Simply  put,  this  measure  encour-
ages  the  Department  of  Energy  to  work  with  the  National  Science
Foundation  to  help  develop  the  next  generation  of  engineers  and
architects to work effectively together to produce buildings that will
incorporate  the  latest  in  energy-efficient  technologies.  I  commend
Mr. McCaul for his fine work on this bill.

Finally,  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  H.R.  632,  the  H–Prize
Act, sponsored by Mr. Inglis and Mr. Lipinski. This legislation was
introduced  in  the  last  Congress  and  passed  overwhelmingly  by  the
House of Representatives. This bill directs the Secretary of Energy
to  award  competitive  cash  prizes  biannually  to  advance  the  re-
search, development, demonstration and commercial applications of
hydrogen energy technologies. Categories eligible for prizes include

advancements  in  certain  hydrogen  components  or  systems,  proto-
types  of  hydrogen-powered  vehicles  and  transformational  changes
in  the  technologies  for  hydrogen  distribution  or  production.  I  com-
mend  Mr.  Inglis  and  Mr.  Lipinski  for  introducing  this  legislation
and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

Once again, Mr. Chairman, I am happy to be supportive of these
three  bipartisan  pieces  of  legislation.  I  look  forward  to  working
with you to advance these bills.

I yield back my time, sir.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hall follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Mr. Chairman, you and I have been working together for over 22 years now—and
on the same side of the aisle for most of that time. Why, if it weren’t for me switch-
ing parties, you might not be the Chairman right now! You can thank me later. . ..
When  you  work  with  someone  as  long  as  we  have,  not  only  on  this  committee,  but
also  on  the  Commerce  Committee,  there  are  bound  to  be  times  when  we’re  going
to disagree, and as much as I dislike going against my good friend from Tennessee,
sometimes it just happens. As it turns out, today is one of those days. While I com-
mend  my  friend  for  his  efforts  on  behalf  of  boosting  energy  R&D,  I  disagree  with
the way H.R. 364 does it. I have to say that I have a problem with the idea of cre-
ating  a  new  bureaucracy  within  the  Department  of  Energy  that  will,  regardless  of

budget  parameters  we  are  working  with,  I  am  not  comfortable  authorizing  the  cre-
ation  of  ARPA–E  based  on  a  vague  recommendation  that  was  in  the  Gathering
Storm report.

The facts are that DOE currently has the authority to do ARPA-type projects, but
DOE is woefully under-funded. I am concerned that we could be faced with the prob-
lem of having both the Office of Science and ARPA–E under-funded so that neither
of  them  is  operating  at  its  full  potential  if  we  go  forward  with  creating  this  new
agency. Before we go forward with any ARPA-type projects, I would like the Section
1821  study  in  EPAct  to  be  completed  that  looks  at  the  applicability  of  the  DARPA
management practices and the advisability of creating a DARPA-type agency within
DOE  before  moving  forward  with  legislation.  To  that  end  I  will  be  introducing  an
amendment  that,  without  creating  a  new  bureaucracy,  would  require  the  Secretary
of Energy to identify and accelerate advanced research projects at the DOE that will
address our energy needs. I, along with several of my colleagues, have sent a letter
to  the  Secretary  urging  him  to  complete  the  study  as  mandated  by  law  so  that  we

nology Transfer Working Group. As several of our witnesses testified to in our Sub-
committee  hearing,  technology  transfer  plays  an  integral  part  in  the  process  from
basic research to widespread commercialization.

I don’t think anyone would dispute that our country needs clean, affordable, reli-
able  energy  that  is  generated  through  research  and  development.  This  committee
should continue to advance legislation that addresses our most critical energy needs
in  a  fiscally  responsible  manner.  To  that  end,  I  will  be  introducing  legislation  by
the end of this week that will help accomplish these goals.

In addition to the ARPA–E legislation we will also be marking up H.R. 1467, H.R.
1716,  and  H.R.  632.  I  am  an  original  co-sponsor  of  H.R.  1467,  the  10,000  Trained

mented  correctly  and  efficiently,  health  information  technology  (IT)  can  revolu-
tionize  our  health  care  system.  But,  we  must  have  an  educated  workforce,  properly
trained in health IT, in order for it to be successful. This is what H.R. 1467 is about.
NSF  is  already  doing  work  yeoman’s  work  in  the  IT  arena,  but  this  measure  will
increase the focus on health IT. I encourage my colleagues to support it.

pieces  of  legislation  and  look  forward  to  working  with  you  to  advance  these  bills.
I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  As  you  have  pointed
out,  we  have  had  a  good  working  relationship  and  I  will  point  out
that every bill that has come out of this committee has been unani-
mous  and  the  only—one  bill  received  21  negative  votes  on  the
Floor.  That  is  the  worst  we  have  done  on  the  Floor.  We  are  going
to have I hope three unanimous bills today and I think the reason
that  we  have  been  able  to  do  this  is,  we  have  started  with  good
bills.  We  have  had  extensive  consultation  and  by  making  better
bills. At the end of the day we are going to have our first disagree-
ment  but  I  think  two  things  will  happen:  We  are  going  to  have
amendments  today  that  will  make  the  bill  even  better  and  I  think
at  the  end  of  the  day  that  it  will  be  a  bipartisan  bill  but  it  won’t
be a unanimous bill, and we will try to proceed without kicking or
scratching  and  we  will  get  this  done.  So  without  objection,  Mem-
bers may place statements in the record at this point.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Today  we  are  considering  several  bills  to  decrease  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil

and encourage renewable sources of energy.

As  the  world  leader  in  emissions  of  greenhouse  gasses,  it  is  imperative  that  we
as a nation actively pursue the means to reduce those emissions. We have an obliga-
tion  to  lead  the  world  toward  a  solution.  One  way  to  accomplish  this  is  to  invest
in alternative energy sources.

The  bills  before  us  today  would  put  in  place  necessary  components  to  take  us
where we need to be as a nation including education and training, monetary incen-
tives, and fast acting, responsive research programs.

The  United  States  must  lead  by  example  and  invest  in  clean,  renewable  energy

sources.

to working on them.

Today,  we  are  considering  several  bills  to  address  this  issue  and  I  look  forward

Sustainable energy is an issue that affects our environment, our economy, and our
national security, and we cannot leave this problem for future generations of Ameri-
cans to solve.

I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman  GORDON.  We  will  now  consider  H.R.  364,  To  provide
for the establishment of Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy.
I yield myself five minutes to describe the bill.

H.R.  364  addresses  the  National  Academies  of  Science  Rising
Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  which  recommended  establishing  an
ARPA–E  to  shorten  the  time  period  for  transforming  research  into
technologies  that  will  make  us  more  energy-efficient,  sustain  our
economy,  achieve  energy  security  and  improve  our  environment.
Energy  powers  our  economy  and  supports  the  quality  of  life  we
enjoy in this country. We owe it to our children and grandchildren

to tackle our energy supply problems now before we reach a crisis.
By investing in research, development and deployment of new tech-
nologies, we can deliver to them an energy-secure future. If you are
satisfied with the status quo and you believe that the current pace
of  technology  transfer  will  get  us  to  the  energy  future  we  need,
then  you  would  conclude  we  do  not  need  an  ARPA–E.  However,  if
you  are  not  satisfied  with  our  current  progress,  if  you  believe  we
need  a  new  model  of  technology  transfer  that  moves  creative  basic
science  from  the  laboratory  bench  to  the  marketplace,  you  should
support H.R. 364. We must engage the private sector, the national
labs and the universities in a manner not done today and we need
a strong, cohesive community of researchers, technology developers
intent on transforming our energy economy as we know it.

I  want  to  thank  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee  for  working
with  me  on  this  bill.  Over  the  past  two  weeks  we  have  had  very
productive  discussions  that  are  embodied  in  several  of  the  amend-
ments  we  will  consider  this  morning.  Mr.  Inglis  and  Mr.  Bartlett
have  been  especially  helpful  in  the  effort  to  craft  this  legislation
and  the  bill  will  be  improved  this  morning  as  a  result  of  their  ef-
forts.  Our  constituents  get  the  best  outcome  when  we  work  to-
gether  to  achieve  our  common  goals.  So  I  urge  my  colleagues  to
support  H.R.  364  and  vote  for  a  brighter,  more  secure  energy  fu-
ture.

And  let  me  read  to  the  Committee  just  a  few  of  the  endorse-
ments.  We  really  haven’t  sought  endorsements  but  to  give  you  an
idea  of  the  wide  breadth  of  this,  the  American  Public  Power  Asso-
ciation, the American Iron and Steel Institute, the American Petro-
leum Institute, the American Society for Mechanical Engineers, the
American  Federation  of  Scientists,  the  Edison  Electric  Institute,
the  Gas  Technology  Institute,  the  Independent  Petroleum  Associa-
tion  of  America,  Information,  MIT,  the  National  Association  of
Manufacturers,  the  National  Hydrogen  Association,  the  National
Association of Rural Electric Cooperatives, Texas A&M, University
of  Michigan,  the  Climate  Policy  Center,  the  National  Commission
on  Energy  Policy,  and  they  continue  to  come  in  every  day.  So  this
is widely, widely supported.

So  now  I  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  present  any  remarks  on  the  bill.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  I  have  pretty  well  expressed
myself  in  the  opening  statement  in  that  it  creates  another  agency
within DOE and is way, way, way too expensive.

I yield back.
Chairman GORDON. Does anyone else wish to be recognized? Yes,

Mr. Rohrabacher.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  am  sorry.  I  haven’t  really  studied  the  bill
and  I  will  have  to  admit  that;  and  I  will  have  to  note  that  I  dis-
agree  with  my  Ranking  Member  respectfully  that  the  idea  of  just
creating  a  new  bureaucracy.  I  mean,  that  is—I  think  that  this  is
just the opposite of that. I think it actually is a way to get around
the bureaucracy and try to get some resources directly to some cre-
ative-thinking  people.  So  I  would  be  inclined  to  support  your  con-
cept.  I  am  interested  in  how  we  are  going  to  pay  for  it  and  how
much  we  are  talking  about  here.  Maybe  you  can  enlighten  us  to
where we are going to get the money and how much is going to be
spent.

Chairman  GORDON.  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  I  think  that  is  a  very  fair
question. First of all, you are correct. The idea is to get around the
bureaucracy.  This  is  a  DARPA-type  program.  This  is  going  to  be  a
very  thin  program.  I  hope  there  is  less  than  100  people.  They  are
going to subcontract this out to the private sector, the public sector,
to national labs. You are going to have a program manager that is
going to try to, you know, corral all this, and the purpose—the rea-
son you want to get it out of the bureaucracy is—Mr. Ehlers can—
he  spoke  to  it  eloquently  the  other  day  when  he  said,  you  know,
a part of science research is failing. This is high risk, high reward.
Some  of  these  are  going  to  fail.  We  expect  them  to  fail.  If  you  are
in the Department of Energy and you fail, then you are in trouble.
Here we want to take those risks. Just like the Internet, the devel-
oping Internet was a risk, developing stealth technology——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  I  agree  with  you  on  that  but  what

about the money?

Chairman  GORDON.  Okay.  The  money—at  the  start  of  this  ses-
sion,  I  think  it  was  maybe  the  fifth  bill,  I  am  not  sure,  there  was
a  bill  in  Congress  that  has  also  I  think  passed  the  Senate  that
needs to be compromised or it needs to be conferenced that will do
away  with  the  tax  breaks  that  were  given  to  so-called  Big  Oil  for
additional  drilling  in  the  last  Congress.  The  feeling  was  that  with
the price of oil as high as it is, they don’t need additional incentives
to  go  drilling,  and  I  think  that  is  several  billion—I  will  ask  the
counsel, do you know how many billions of dollars that is?

Mr. COUNSEL. I believe it is scored at $14 billion roughly.
Chairman GORDON. That is $14 billion——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, Mr. Chairman, that is the right answer
because  I  happen  to  be  one  of  the  few  Republicans  who  voted
against  those  tax  incentives  that  I  didn’t  feel  were  necessary  at  a
time of high profit as well. So that is the right answer.

Chairman  GORDON.  We  have  spoken  directly  with  the  Speaker
about  this.  This  is  a  high  priority  for  her  and  again  in  the  whole,
you  know,  so  many  of  the  private  sector.  So  we  will  be  going  into
that  trust  fund  for  those—you  know,  that  money.  Now,  again,  in
all  honesty,  when  you  get  into  bookkeeping,  you  know,  I  guess  it
is  one  pot  or  the  other  pot  but  that  is  where  we  intend  to  go  for
new money.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  feel  more  com-
fortable  with  this  if  it  indeed  was  being  taken  out  of  the  current
bureaucracy  and  being  fenced  off,  and  I  know  a  lot  of  people  who
would  have  just  the  opposite  reaction.  To  me,  it  seems  it  makes
more sense, but by and large, the idea about having a DARPA-like
agency  or  DARPA-like  effort  in  the  Department  of  Energy  is  a
sound  idea.  National  security  today  depends  on  energy  self-suffi-
ciency  and  efficiency  and  I  am  going  to  be  supportive  of  this  con-
cept and your legislation.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman  GORDON.  Let  me  see  if  anybody  from  this  side  of  the

aisle wanted to comment.

Ms. Giffords, then we will go to you.
Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  just  want  to  speak
briefly  and  congratulate  you  and  thank  you  for  bringing  this  bill
forward.  As  we  head  into  the  Memorial  Day  weekend,  we  see

record-high  prices  for  gasoline,  and  what  this  piece  of  legislation
does  effectively  is  deal  with  three  major  issues  that  we  face  every
day  in  southern  Arizona,  we  face  across  our  country:  energy  inde-
pendence,  making  sure  that  we  start  investing  in  energy  sources
that  are  completely  independent  of  foreign  countries  so  that  that
we  can  be  self-sustaining.  The  second  area  is  global  warming  and
we have heard testimony time and time again about how our plan-
et  is  getting  hotter,  how  we  need  to  start  investing  in  new  types
of  technology,  new  energy  systems  that  are  going  to  be  clean  and
that are not going to be releasing greenhouse gases. The third area
is  U.S.  competitiveness.  We  need,  as  the  Rising  Above  the  Gath-
ering Storm report talks about, to make sure that we are producing
scientists  and  engineers  and  mathematicians  so  that  we  can  com-
plete in this global new economy. Where we are graduating 60,000
engineers, China graduates 600,000 engineers. So this piece of leg-
islation,  Mr.  Chairman,  pulls  together  some  of  the  most  pressing
issues of our day and offers a solution that—and like you said, Mr.
Chairman,  some  people  will  fail—but  here  we  have  a  DARPA-like
agency  where  engineers  and  scientists  can  be  free  to  think  totally
outside  the  box  and  have  that  breakthrough  Eureka  moment  that
is  so  important  if  we  need  to,  you  know,  change  the  way  that,  you
know,  we  live  on  this  planet.  So  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  looking  for-
ward to voting for this bill. I want to thank you again for bringing
it forward.

Chairman GORDON. Ms. Biggert.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  just  have  a  question.
You talked about the fund of $14 million, I believe. Is there a provi-
sion in this bill which will allow access to that fund?

Chairman GORDON. I don’t know.
Mr. HALL. Did you say billion or million?
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Billion.  I  think  I  said  million  but  I  meant  billion.
Chairman  GORDON.  I  don’t  know  how  you  would  have  in  an  au-
thorization any kind of language that would tap into an appropria-
tion. We would like to do it. I wish we could, but I don’t think that
would be possible.

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, we seem to be doing this in the housing area
where we have an affordable housing fund established. Couldn’t we
have a bill that would, if money is authorized, you take that money
if it is appropriated by the appropriators.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  don’t  think  there  is  any  way  you  can  do
that.  I  mean,  if  you—potentially  if  this  was  Ways  and  Means  and
going  through  Ways  and  Means,  they  might  be  able  to  go  back  to
that  tax  provision  but  I  don’t  think  it  is  possible  to  do  it  with  this
type of authorization.

Ms. BIGGERT. What about the Highway Trust Fund?
Chairman GORDON. Well, we don’t have authority over the High-

way Trust Fund.

Ms. BIGGERT. No, I know, but this is similar. We actually author-

Chairman GORDON. The Transportation Committee does.
Ms. BIGGERT. Yes.
Chairman GORDON. But this is not——

136

Ms.  BIGGERT.  But  isn’t  there  a  way  to  establish  that  this  provi-
sion would be in this bill? Otherwise there is $14 billion there and
then we are going to go for $6 billion someplace else?

Chairman  GORDON.  You  know,  the  simple  fact  is,  the  fund  isn’t
jurisdiction  to  us.  What  I  would  like  to  do  is,  we  have  a  period  of
time  between  this  bill  now  going  to  the  Floor  where  we  can  have
a  manager’s  amendment,  coming  back  in  conference,  and  let  me
point out to you a similar bill had 67 co-sponsors on the Senate in-
cluding  McConnell  and  Reid,  and  passed  there  with  less  than  ten
opposition votes. But I would love to be able to find a way to guar-
antee these funds and we will be happy to work with you between
now and the final date to do that, and it would be, as Ms. Giffords
said, a Eureka moment if we can accomplish that. So we will work
together and try to do so but I don’t see how that can happen and
I certainly don’t have language for it——

Ms. BIGGERT. No, there is a fund that we have presently that the
appropriators  have  tried  to  do  away  with  and  we  have  always
made  them  aware  how  important  it  is.  And  that  is  a  fund  for  sci-
entists when they are working on a project and discover that what
they were working on fails but they found something else and they
can  switch  to  that  based  on  the  funds  that  are  available  through
that.  It  seems  like  there  is  some  way  that  we  could  get  this  into
the bill.

Chairman  GORDON.  Yeah,  I  would  suggest  that  we  work  on  that
together  and  we  will  have  a  manager’s  amendment  to  accomplish
that  and  we  will  have  a  duel  Eureka  if  we  can  get  that  accom-
plished.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. HALL. Will the gentlelady yield?
Ms. BIGGERT. Yes, I yield to the Ranking Member.
Mr.  HALL.  By  the  way,  doesn’t  the  Senate  bill—it  doesn’t  set  up
a new agency. That is half of my objection that they have cured for
us,  and  it  still  costs  more—and  we  are  trying  to  follow  the  Gath-
ering  Storm  recommendations.  It  still  costs  more  than  the  Gath-
ering  Storm  reported  by  $1.6  billion  additional,  and  I  have  asked
the  gentlelady  if  she  understands  that  this—and  Professor  Ehlers
would  understand  that  this  practically  and  potentially  takes  away
from  basic  research  at  the  Office  of  Science  which  was  also  a  pri-
ority  of  the  Gathering  Storm  report.  It  is  too  much  increase  in  a
new agency. That is my basic objections to it.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. If the gentlelady would yield just to respond
to  Mr.  Hall.  In  response  to  his  suggestion,  we  will  have  a  man-
ager’s  amendment  that  will  reduce  the  authorizing  level  by  $1.4
billion.  Again  in  an  effort  to  be  responsive,  I  think  there  is  going
to  be  an  amendment  by  Mr.  Inglis  that  will  provide  protection  for
the Office of Science, again trying to make a good bill better.

Ms. BIGGERT. Reclaiming my time. I think that we will be speak-
ing  to  that  amendment,  but  I  also  have  one  that  will  increase  the
funding,  or  make  sure  that  the  Office  of  Science  has  full  funding
for  the  priority.  I  think  that  Mr.  Inglis’  amendment  really  sets  a
floor which Appropriations will look at and say that that is all that
they  have  to  fund  in  the  Office  of  Science  if  his  amendment  is
passed, but we will address that later.

I yield back.
Chairman GORDON. Does anyone else wish to be recognized?
Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Bilbray.
Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, it is obvious that my dear colleague
from  California  hadn’t  read  the  bill  because  I  think  he  would  see
some  of  the  red  lights  that  we  recognized  when  we  made  the  mis-
take,  or  some  people  around  here  made  the  mistake,  of  creating
what  they  thought  would  be  the  super-agency  for  homeland  secu-
rity.  And  that  creating  a  new  structure  with  a  new  name  was
somehow going to break through and create new answers, when in
fact  it  created  new  problems.  So  I  just  ask  my  colleagues  to  look
seriously  at  the  issue.  So  often  we  are  so  quick  as  elected  officials
to want to put our name onto a new agency so we can say we cre-
ated that agency. And I don’t need to go down the list of how many
agencies  that  we  created  that  supposedly  are  going  to  educate  our
children, end poverty as we know it, secure our neighborhoods; and
in  reality  we  spend  a  lot  of  money  on  a  structure  and  not  on  an-
swers.  I  just  think  that  too  often  that  a  comparison  with  DARPA
is  not  appropriate  at  this  level.  DARPA  has  a  guaranteed  market,
the  United  States  Federal  Government,  when  it  produces  a  prod-
uct.  What  you  are  proposing  today,  is  the  United  States  Govern-
ment  is  going  to  be  buying  this  energy  or  whatever  product  comes
out  of  this  agency.  It  is  a  whole  different  approach  to  this  and  I
just  ask  that  we  at  least  have  some  peer  review  by  the  scientists
about what does work or doesn’t work. I mean, American Chemical
Societies sat there and said that they saw the Office of Science that
would be the vehicle that is underfunded right now by $500 million
in  unmet  opportunities.  Creating  a  new  agency  doesn’t  fulfill  the
scientific demand out there or the unmet opportunities just by hir-
ing people to supervise another side of this issue. I yield back, Mr.
Chairman, but I just wanted to raise my concerns on this issue.

Chairman GORDON. Would you yield to me?
Mr. BILBRAY. Yes, I would, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you.  You  raised  a  lot  of  issues  there.
Let me try to address some of them. On the one hand, you say just
giving  more  money  doesn’t  solve  problems.  Well,  if  you  think  that
the  Department  of  Energy  with  doing  the  status  quo  right  now  is
adequate,  which  is  basically  what  you  are  arguing  for,  then  every-
thing is hunky-dory.

Mr. BILBRAY. Reclaiming my time.
Chairman GORDON. Sure.
Mr.  BILBRAY.  I  am  not  saying  that,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  saying
that  creating  a  new  separate  section  while  you  have  the  Office  on
Science  and  then  expect  this  new  section  to  tool  up,  create  its
whole bureaucracy, create internal protocols and then be able to re-
spond is exactly the mistake we made with Homeland Security.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  was  going  to  get  to  that.  So  again,  first  of
all  I  think  there  is  an  argument  for  status  quo.  The  second  thing
is,  you  are  absolutely  correct  about  the  Homeland  Security  Office.
It  was  a  mess,  and  we  learned  from  that,  and  the  reason  it  was
a  mess  is,  it  was  a  part  of  the  bureaucracy.  ARPA–E  is  not  going
to  be  part  of  bureaucracy.  It  is  going  to  report  directly  to  the  Sec-
retary  of  Energy.  It  is  going  to  be  a  DARPA  model.  It  is  going  to

be  a  very  thin  little  line  and  so  work  is  going  to  be  done  outside
of Washington, outside of the Department of Energy. You are going
to  have  a  program  director  that  is  going  to  be  the  maestro  that  is
going to work with private sector, universities and labs to bring all
this  together.  The  whole  idea  is  to  take  it  out  of  the  bureaucracy
because the bureaucracy is not performing properly. The status quo
is not getting the job done. This is going to be different than what
they did in Homeland Security.

Mr. BILBRAY. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Certainly.
Mr.  BILBRAY.  Look,  the  direction  comes  from  up  above,  and  the
fact  is,  is  that  the  priorities  have  been  set  by  the  Administration.
Both  the  past  Administration,  which  did  everything  to  decommis-
sion  zero  generation,  shut  down  hydroelectric,  shut  down—you
know,  basically  defund  ITER  technology,  which  is  exactly  the  kind
of  definition  we  are  talking  about,  developing  fusion.  The  previous
Administration  abandoned  it.  The  present  one  didn’t.  You  are  not
going  to  change  that  by  creating  a  new  structure  with  a  new  set
of  bureaucrats  that  are  going  to  still  be  bureaucrats  once  you  cre-
ated  them.  And  to  think  that  extra  layer  is  somehow  going  to  get
out  from  the  administrative  oversight,  that  is  a  challenge  that  we
have  to  do  to  get  both  administrations,  Democrats  and  Repub-
licans,  to  focus  on  this.  It  is  so  easy  to  talk  about  process,  that  by
creating  a  new  agency,  we  will  create  a  secret  process  or  a  new
process that will change the outcome. It is the substance that leads
to  the  outcome  that  matters  and  process  be  damned.  I  agree  with
you  that  the  outcome  has  not  been  successful.  I  just  don’t  think
this  vehicle  will  be  the  vehicle  to  get  to  the  outcome  that  you  are
aiming for.

I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  sir.  Your  argument  is  for  let  us
continue to do what we are doing and that is a fair argument, and
if you want to support the status quo and you think that is getting
the  job  done,  you  should  oppose  this  bill.  If  you  are  not  satisfied
with  status  quo  and  you  want  a  new  approach,  then  we  are  going
to  try  to  make  that  available.  So  if  it  is  all  right  with  everyone—
Mr. Ehlers?

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just a brief word on this
latest argument. I wouldn’t hold up the Homeland Security Depart-
ment  as  a  good  example  for  anything,  and  that  is  what  my  col-
league is doing. He is holding it up as a bad example and it is sim-
ply  because  we  took  collection  of  a  large  number  of  different  de-
partments all filled with bureaucrats and threw them all in one pot
and  said  okay,  do  your  work.  It  just  doesn’t  work  well.  The  dif-
ference here is, we are not talking about having more bureaucrats.
We are hiring scientists and turning them loose. I have always said
the most effective way to get good results is hire the best scientists,
give  them  enough  money  to  work  with,  close  the  door  and  walk
away and let them do their work because you get the most produc-
tivity,  the  brightest  ideas  at  that  point.  So  I  don’t  think  that  the
analogy  of  Homeland  Security  is  valid  at  all.  This  will  be  a  sepa-
rate  agency.  It  can  be  destroyed  by  over-administration.  I  think  to
a  certain  extent  that  has  happened  to  the  Department  of  Energy
over the years. It has always been a stellar agency but it has been

mismanaged during the past—well, during the decade of the 1990s,
let  us  say.  But  this  gives  us  an  opportunity  to  try  a  different  ap-
proach with a separate but integrated agency and I think it is cer-
tainly  an  experiment  worth  doing.  We  will  know  in  a  decade
whether or not the experiment is working and at that time our suc-
cessors  can  make  a  judgment  as  to  whether  or  not  it  should  con-
tinue.

I yield back.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Dr. Ehlers.
I  know  to  be  courteous  to  Members,  there  are  several  markups
going  on  and  folks  have  other  things  to  do  today  so  I  am  going  to
ask  unanimous  consent  that  this  bill  is  considered  as  read  and
open  to  amendments  at  any  point  and  that  Members  proceed  with
the  amendments  in  the  order  of  roster.  Without  objection,  so  or-
dered.

The  first  amendment  on  the  roster  is  the  manager’s  amendment

to the bill. The Clerk will report the amendment.

The CLERK. Amendment to H.R. 364——
Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with

the reading. Without objection, so ordered.

I  recognize  myself  for  five  minutes  to  explain  the  amendment.
This amendment makes a series of perfecting changes in our efforts
to move the best bill possible out of the Committee. These changes
are  based  upon  discussion  during  the  Subcommittee  markup  and
discussion  that  we  have  had  over  the  past  two  weeks.  First,  there
are  several  changes  to  address  the  issues  related  to  hiring  author-
ity  of  the  director  and  the  selection  of  the  talented  individuals  to
serve as program managers and staff. Having the right staff is crit-
ical  to  the  success  of  ARPA–E.  This  is  intended  to  be  a  lean  oper-
ation. Nothing in the amendment alters that goal. The amendment
gives  the  director  discretion  to  hire  technical,  financial  and  mana-
gerial  staff  in  addition  to  the  program  managers.  The  amendment
also specifies that the Director should look toward academia in ad-
dition to private industry and former DARPA staff in making selec-
tions for the initial staff of ARPA–E. Furthermore, the amendment
recognizes  that  the  Director  is  not  expected  to  know  the  universe
of  talented  individuals  capable  of  functioning  as  technical  staff  of
ARPA–E and therefore may contract with outside firms specializing
in recruiting such talent. The amendment also provides some tech-
nical corrections and program clarifications related to the authority
of  the  program  managers.  As  I  have  stated  before,  ARPA–E  is  to
be a lean, responsive organization with the freedom to pursue high-
risk,  high-payoff  research.  The  amendment  clarifies  the  program
manager’s  role  in  this  process.  The  amendment  also  clarifies  the
program  manager’s  authority  and  responsibility  to  recommend  the
termination  of  any  project  that  does  not  show  promise.  However,
only the person authorized to enter into contracts has the legal au-
thority  to  terminate  that  contract.  The  amendment  also  changes
the  name  of  the  fund  set  up  in  this  bill  to  reflect  the  evolution  of
thought  since  the  bill  was  first  written  in  2005.  We  are  now  fo-
cused on transforming the energy sector for reasons beyond just en-
ergy independence. The amendment drops the final year of the au-
thorization to change the bill from a six-year to a five-year author-
ization. The bill reduces the overall cost of H.R. 364 by $1.4 billion.

Finally,  in  response  to  concerns  expressed  by  a  number  of  com-
mittee Members, the advice of outside parties and witnesses’ testi-
mony  at  the  Subcommittee  hearing,  this  amendment  drops  the  re-
cruitment section of the bill.

I think this is a noncontroversial amendment which further per-

fects the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, I see the manager’s amendment strives
to  make  some  improvements  to  the  bill.  I  am  still  not  comfortable
with the structure of the underlying bill. I still agree with the Sen-
ate that it does not set up a new agency, as you do, and the amend-
ment money-wise, I think you would wind up with $4.9 billion and
the amendment I will send up is $750 million. There is quite a dif-
ference  there,  and  I  think  we  both  are  trying  to  pattern  as  much
as we can after the Gathering Storm reports that Norm Augustine
wrote, and I believe that yours is $1.6 billion more than the Gath-
ering Storm report requested, substantially more, and for that rea-
son I object to it.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  I  think  we  take  care
of  your  number  figure  in  this  manager’s  amendment.  We  reduce
the  authorization  by  $1.4  billion,  and  we  think  there  are  many
Members  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  that  made  recommendations
that have been incorporated into this manager’s amendment.

Mr. HALL. I will wait right here and watch.
Chairman  GORDON.  If  there  is  no  further  discussion  on  the
amendment,  the  vote  is  on  the  amendment.  All  in  favor,  say  aye.
Those opposed, say no. The ayes have it. The amendment is agreed
to.

The second amendment on the roster is an amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute offered by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hall.
Are you ready to proceed with your amendment?

Mr. HALL. I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The CLERK. Amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 364
offered  by  Mr.  Hall  of  Texas,  Mr.  Gingrey  of  Georgia  and  Mrs.
Biggert of Illinois.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with

the reading. Without objection, so ordered.

The  gentleman  is  recognized  for  five  minutes  to  explain  the

amendment.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, there seems to be a consensus that the
types  of  projects  ARPA–E  would  engage  in  would  be  beneficial  to
addressing  our  country’s  ongoing  energy  supply  needs  but  I  think
we  tend  to  diverge  when  we  look  to  find  out  how  to  implement
these projects. Chairman Gordon’s bill would create a new bureauc-
racy  within  the  Department  of  Energy  that  would  oversee  ARPA–
E. I don’t feel that this is the best way to do this rather than jump-
ing right into the idea that it has a one-and-one record. In the first
place,  DARPA,  DOD  was  considered  a  success  and  the  other  one
ARPA,  Homeland  Security,  as  suggested  by  the  gentleman  from
California,  was  considered  a  failure.  So  rather  than  jumping  right
into  an  idea  that  has  a  one-and-one  or  an  even  and  even  record,
I  feel  that  we  really  need  to  approach  this  with  a  little  more  cau-
tion  and  skepticism  before  throwing  $4.9  billion  into  an  unknown.
Now, some are going to argue that we don’t have time to wait and

study  the  idea  but  I  disagree  with  that.  The  DOE  is  a  $23  billion
agency that is currently conducting research in all areas that H.R.
364 directs ARPA–E to address; so to take a step back and say let
us  make  sure  that  this  is  the  right  thing  to  do  before  committing
billions  of  taxpayer  dollars  I  think  makes  some  sense.  The  Hall-
Gingrey-Biggert  substitute  amendment  recognizes  while  the  De-
partment of Energy has the authority to promote technology trans-
fer  of  basic  and  applied  research,  there  is  a  need  to  more  quickly
identify  opportunities  to  accelerate  the  commercial  application  of
new energy technologies to meet our national energy needs as well.
Also a more fully integrated approach to advanced energy research
is going to help bridge the gap between basic research and applied
technology  to  overcome  long-term  and  high-risk  barriers  to  the  de-
velopment of advanced energy technologies with an eye toward fis-
cal  conservatism.  My  substitute  is  conditioned  on  the  section  1821
study  in  EPAct.  This  was  the  study  that  required  DOE  to  look  at
‘‘best  practices’’  management  at  the  Department  of  Energy  includ-
ing DARPA to DOE. I have sent, by the way, the Secretary a letter
to complete this study, and I had 12 of my colleagues here join with
us.  The  substitute  amendment  does  not  create  a  new  agency  but
requires  the  Secretary  to  use  his  existing  authority  coupled  with
the newly established DARPA hiring authority to undertake ARPA-
type  projects.  It  authorizes  $750  million,  not  $4.9  billion,  over  five
years  for  the  Secretary  to  carry  out  the  projects  and  requires  the
Secretary  to  report  to  Congress  on  their  status.  So  it  also  allows
the Secretary to coordinate with other agencies on advanced energy
projects,  directs  the  Secretary  to  coordinate  with  the  to-be-ap-
pointed  technology  transfer  coordinator,  allows  the  Secretary  to
award  prizes  for  achievement  under  an  advanced  energy  research
project, and establishes cost sharing according to the Energy Policy
Act of 2005.

I  think  this  substitute  amendment  is  sensible.  I  think  it  is  a  re-
sponsible  alternative  to  the  underlying  bill  and  I  urge  my  col-
leagues to support it.

I yield back, sir.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Gingrey is recognized.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  I  rise  to  support
the  Hall-Biggert-Gingrey  amendment.  I  think  the  idea  of  ARPA–E
certainly has merit and I can understand how it came forward. You
know,  it  is  sort  of  interesting  how  we  come  up  with  acronyms  and
the  acronym  DARPA  sounds  good,  has  a  good  ring  to  it,  but  if  we
followed  that  line,  then  this  new  agency  would  be  called  EARPA.
We  decided  to  name  it  ARPA–E,  which  sounds  a  little  bit  better.
The  one  in  the  Homeland  Security  Department,  I  guess  we  could
call  that  HARPA.  That  doesn’t  have  a  real  good  ring  to  it  and  it
wasn’t very successful.

But  I  agree  with  the  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Hall,  in  regard  to
creating  yet  another  expensive  agency  within  the  Department  of
Energy when, as he pointed out, we are talking about a $23 billion
agency which really right now I think is working. The Department
of  Energy  with  its  Secretary,  Sam  Bodman,  chemical  engineer  by
training,  someone  that  is  running  a  good  department,  and  the  Of-
fice of Science within the Department of Energy I think is probably
the  place  where  this  kind  of  activity  should  be  under  the  existing

funding. And there is a recent letter, Mr. Chairman, you are famil-
iar  with  it,  from  the  American  Chemical  Society,  of  which  I  am  a
member  as  a  graduate  of  Georgia  Tech  with  a  Bachelor  of  Science
in  chemistry,  but  I  just  believe  that  the  Ranking  Member  hit  the
nail  right  on  the  head  in  regard  to  this.  It  sounds  good  but  it  is
growing  the  government.  It  is  unnecessary.  It  is  duplication.  In-
stead of really being ARPA–E and sounding good, we ought to call
it EARPA and reject it, so I yield back my time.
Chairman GORDON. Ms. Biggert is recognized.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you.  Move  to  strike  the  last  word.  Thank
you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  know  how  hard  you  worked  on  this.  And  I
think we all agree that this project is very important. Research and
development  is  very  important.  And  I  think  really  the  only  dif-
ference  that  we  are  really  talking  about  is  whether  to  have  it  in
the  Department  of  Energy  or  have  it  as  a  separate  agency.  And  I
think  that  over  the  years  you  have  been  on  this  committee,  and  I
have been on this committee, we have really worked to improve the
Department of Energy. There is—I would like to just read a couple
words  from  a  hearing  that  was  held  last  year,  March  of  2006,  Dr.
David Mowery testified from the University of California at Berke-
ley and talking about proposals for expanded R&D in energy, in al-
ternative energy. He said, ‘‘We are very positive.’’ He served on the
National Academy of Science panel that assessed the value of DOE
investments in alternative energy and energy conservation and en-
ergy  efficiency  programs,  and  the  consensus  was  that  the  returns
of these investments were positive and the Committee felt that the
Department  of  Energy  had  overall  done  an  effective  job  of  man-
aging these. And I think that probably is true but I think that they
can  do  better  and  we  can  do  better.  And  I  think  to  bring  it  back
to  the  Department,  I  think  we  worked  on  improving  the  Office  of
Science  to  be  the  research  and  development  arm  as  the  starting
point there. And they have always worked with outside groups, and
I  think  to  put  it  in  there  would  be  a  benefit  to  have  improvement.
You  know,  I  worked  on  GNEP  and  was  very  frustrated  with  the
Department when they wouldn’t do a systems analysis to really get
the  nuclear  program  going,  and  we  argued  about  that.  So  I  think
there is a lot of room. But I hate to see everybody saying how bad
the  Department  of  Energy  has  done  and  the  Office  of  Science  be-
cause  I  think  if  we  look  back,  I  remember  going  to  Argonne  with
the Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, and looking at the fuel
cell  that  was  being  developed  for  the  hydrogen  cars.  And  it  was  a
big  fuel  cell  and  he  said  how  fast  can  you  reduce  that  so  that  we
can put it into a car, and I have since then driven a hydrogen car.
So I think all the things are there. We just need to have the over-
sight and to have a program like this that they can use. You know,
we  changed  the  title  from  the  Director  of  Office  of  Science  to  the
Under  Secretary  to  give  that  top  priority,  and  here  I  think  we  are
not  ignoring  the  problem.  I  mean,  we  are  not  for  status  quo.  It  is
really imperative that all of us, with the global economy and global
competition, that we move with expeditious means. I just—I think,
you know, the only difference I see is that to take it out of the De-
partment  of  Energy  where  they  have  been  moving  and  we  have
given  them  more  direction  and  we  can  proceed  expeditiously  that
way.

With that, I yield back, but I support the——
Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  gentlelady  would  yield,  I  just—once
again,  there  are  not  good  guys  and  bad  guys  here.  There  are  just
two  different  opinions.  If  you  are  for  status  quo,  then  you  should
support  Mr.  Hall’s  amendment,  and  if  you  are  not,  you  should  op-
pose it, and we are not taking it out of the Department of Energy.
We  are  taking  it  out  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s  bureaucracy.
It  reports  directly  to  the  Secretary  of  Energy.  So  it  is  still  within
the  Department  of  Energy.  And  if  I  could  make  one  final  point,
part  of  the  amendment  best  illustrates  why  we  need  to  have  a
change.  A  part  of  this  amendment  suggests  that  the  Department
of Energy should have a study to determine whether or not this is
a  good  idea.  Well,  in  July  of  2005,  we  passed  legislation  that  re-
quired the Department of Energy to have a study, return it within
18  months  of  whether  this  should  be  done.  That  study  was  done
January of 2007 and we still don’t have it. I mean, that is the best
argument  for  getting  it  out  of  the  Department  of  Energy.  They
can’t  even  do  a  study.  So  again,  there  are  not  good  guys  or  bad
guys, there are just two views, and I yield back.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  You  know,  the  ‘‘it  is  time  for  a  change’’  worked  in
a broader sense for you on the other side of the aisle last year but
I do think that we are really—we are not ignoring the problem, we
are not for the status quo. We all want to work to ensure that the
Department of Energy moves forward and the Senate has said that
it  could  be  within  the  Department  of  Energy  so  maybe  we  will
come  back  to  discuss  this  again  but  I  would  yield  to  Mr.  Bilbray.

Mr. BILBRAY. Yes, Mr. Chairman——
Chairman GORDON. Just to get us in the right—I think your time
is—and  I  have  been  part  of  it—is  more  than  expired.  Let  me——

Ms. BIGGERT. I yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  Let  us  recognize  Mr.  Bilbray  to  strike  the

last word and be on his on time there.

Mr. BILBRAY. Strike the last word.
Chairman GORDON. The gentleman is recognized.
Mr.  BILBRAY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  just  think  in  all  fairness  that  the
characterization that anyone who opposes this bill is for the status
quo,  I  think  it  is  inappropriate  and  unfair.  I  think  that  we  have
to  recognize  that  there  are  many  different  approaches  to  how  we
move forward with the energy independence issue and that just be-
cause  someone  may  not  agree  with  the  Chair’s  bill  here  doesn’t
mean  that  they  do  not  want  to  move  forward  and  do  not  want  to
try new things. I just think it is quite unfair to say it is either sta-
tus quo, the way it is now or my way and my way is the only way
to  change  things.  And  I  think  that  is—and  I  think  even  the  Chair
will recognize that is an unfair characterization. I think that what
we  have  is  a  proposal  here  to  create  a  new  vehicle,  new  structure
and think that it will get on operation and be more effective earlier
than  the  science  department  over  there  is  able  to  move  forward
with  their  agenda.  And  if  you  think  that  you  can  create  a  new
agency or new structure and be able to move forward before the ex-
isting  structure  can  tool  up  and  move  forward  with  a  new  ap-
proach,  that  is  the  difference  we  have  here.  But  I  just  think  it  is
unfair  to  say  that  it  is  so  cut  and  dry  that  there  are  those  who
want nothing done and those who are on my side.

144

I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Hall is recognized.
Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, it is not a status quo. We are directing
the  Department  to  do  ARPA–E  projects.  I  think  we  go  really  more
out of the status quo than you do in that we direct them to. I have
read  your  instructions  to  them.  I  may  be  wrong  but  I  don’t  find  in
yours where you use the word ‘‘shall.’’ Maybe you do, but we clearly
do.  You  can’t  say  that  we  are  only  status  quo  when  we  have,  ‘‘Ini-
tial  project  not  later  than  270  days  after  the  date  of  enactment  of
this  act  that  the  Secretary  shall  designate  up  to  two  ARPA–E
projects  for  funding.’’  That  is  shall.  That  is  a  direction  to  them.
That  is  not  status  quo.  You  may  have  some  shalls.  I  just  quickly
looked  over  them  but  your  shalls  aren’t  as  strong  as  my  shalls.
Mine  are  in  capital  letters  and  red  and  ugly.  And  one  of  the  few
things  I  agree  with  the  Senate  on  is,  we  don’t  need  a  new  agency
within  the  Department  of  Energy,  and  go  ask  the  Department  of
Energy what they think about having this within their department
there  to  do  battle  with.  I  don’t  think  you  will  find  anybody  over
there  for  it.  That  doesn’t  make  it  good  or  bad  but  those  are  the
facts. And we set up as much funds as needed to carry out the pur-
pose.  We  didn’t  set  up—the  Senate  has  that.  Well,  I  am  with  the
Senate  now  and  it  is  unusual  for  me  to  be  for  the  Senate.  This  is
not  status  quo.  It  is  just  not  as  much  money  by  a  long  shot  that
you  are  suggesting  to  put  into  the  Department  of  Energy  and  the
Senate is going to knock it off just as quickly as it gets over there.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  sir.  I  will  just  point  out,  it  may
not  have  been  a  big  hairy  ‘‘shall’’  but  the  Department  of  Energy
was  told  that  it  shall  contract  to  have  a  study  on  whether  or  not
there  should  be  something  similar  to  ARPA–E  that  was  supposed
to have been presented in the ‘‘shall’’ sense to Congress in January
2007. They have never even contracted it out. So, you know, shalls,
you have to do more than shalls.

Mr.  HALL.  That  is  the  reason  we  sent  the  letter  to  them,  Mr.

Chairman.

utes.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman  GORDON.  Mr.  Rohrabacher  is  recognized  for  five  min-

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Let  me  again  note  that  I  think  that  your
basic  concept  is  correct  and  that  ARPA–E  concept  is  something
that  might  be  very  beneficial  as  compared  to  the  way  the  setup  is
now  at  the  Department  of  Energy.  You  have  made  the  argument
that  this  is  still  part  of  the  Department  of  Energy.  Let  me  note,
however, that your argument about the status quo not working and
those  hesitant  about  your  idea,  if  your  position  is  that  the  status
quo is not working as it should be at the Department of Energy in
terms  of  energy  development,  we  should  be  taking  the  funds  from
that status quo that is not working and using that as the basis for
a restructuring rather than trying to, you know, just bring in other
funds  when  your  position  is  that  the  current  funds  being  spent  in
the status quo are not working. So while I am supporting your con-
cept,  again  I  am  very  concerned  about  the  redirection  of  funds
when  you  by  your  very  premise  are  suggesting  that  the  current
funds are not being put to best use.

Mr. HALL. Will the gentleman yield?

145

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I certainly would.
Mr.  HALL.  And  you  are  aware  of  the  fact  that  authorization  in
my  amendment,  in  our  amendment  here,  that  we  authorize  $750
million over five years for ARPA–E projects at DOE. Theirs is $4.9
billion  without  saying  exactly  where  it  is  going  to  come  from,  and
the Senate, probably more sensible than either of us, has said that
they  authorized  so  much  funds  as  needed  to  carry  out  their  pur-
poses  and  at  that  time  as  they  are  needed  they  have  to  relegate
or designate where those funds are coming from. That is what you
are asking for and that is what you are not getting.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And again, the idea of having ARPA–E is cer-
tainly  I  believe  the  correct  idea  but  if  we  are  going  to  restructure
because the current system is not working, that is where we should
be getting the funds from, that system that is not working.
Chairman GORDON. If there is no further—oh, excuse me.
Mr.  AKIN.  Could  the  gentleman  yield  for  just  one  additional

thought, Mr. Rohrabacher?
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Sure.
Mr.  AKIN.  It  seems  to  me  that  if  we  have  got  an  agency  that  is
not doing what they ought to do, if we give them a whole lot more
money,  we  are  kind  of  rewarding  them  for  doing  what  we  don’t
want them to do and I think what you are saying makes a certain
amount of sense. Let us take the money out of the Department and
put  it  where  it  is  going  to  do  some  good.  If  we  have  already  told
them  they  shall  do  a  report  and  they  haven’t  done  it,  then  I  say
let  us  take  their  funding  and  put  it  into  something  that  will  do  it,
but  let  us  not  reward  them  by  doubling  their  funding.  Thank  you.
Chairman  GORDON.  If  there  is  no  further  discussion  on  the
amendment, then all in favor say aye. Aye. Oh, excuse me, no. Let
me  start  over,  Mr.  Hall,  so  there  will  be  no  confusion.  All  in  favor
of  the  amendment  say  aye.  Opposed,  say  no.  No.  The  no’s  seem  to
have it.

Chairman GORDON. The motion is not agreed to.
The  third  amendment  on  the  roster  is  offered  by  the  gentleman
from  South  Carolina,  Mr.  Inglis.  I  think  he  just—oh,  there  he  is.
Okay.  Mr.  Inglis,  do  you  need  to  have  yours  moved  further  down?

amendment.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  in  between  two

markups so hopefully this can work.

This  amendment  is  designed  to  do  a  couple  things  to  hopefully
improve the bill, and we have had discussions with the Chairman’s
staff  about  this,  and  I  very  much  appreciate  the  Chairman’s  open-
ness  to  work  to  address  some  concerns  we  have  had,  and  the
amendment  addresses  three  major  concerns.  One  is  protecting  the
existing  research  in  the  Office  of  Science,  second  is  protecting
ARPA–E  from  earmarks,  and  third  is  finding  a  way  to  clarify  how
ARPA–E will overcome the valley of death tech transfer issue.

So  that  first  item,  the  amendment  provides  at  least  one  year  of
protection for existing funding levels for the Office of Science, basi-
cally providing that no funds can be initially given for ARPA–E un-
less  authorized  funds  for  the  Office  of  Science  are  at  fiscal  year
2007  appropriated  levels  plus  the  inflation  rate.  So  the  concept
there is ARPA–E can be funded but only after the Office of Science
is funded at least fiscal year 2007 levels plus inflation. So the first
year  that  ARPA–E  would  exist,  the  test  is  whether  the  Office  of
Science  has  been  funded.  If  it  has  been  funded  at  fiscal  year  2007
plus  inflationary  rate,  then  ARPA–E  can  receive  funds.  So  that  is
the  first  goal,  to  protect  the  existing  research  of  the  Office  of
Science.

The  second  is  to  protect  ARPA–E  from  earmarks  and  what  we
have  done  in  this  amendment  is,  it  directs  the  program  managers
of  ARPA–E  to  select  projects  ‘‘on  the  basis  of  merit’’  with  advice
from  the  advisory  committee  where  appropriate.  So  legislatively
protecting  against  earmarks  is  difficult  but  this  review  approach
has succeeded in keeping the Advanced Technology Program, ATP,
completely  free  from  earmarks  for  the  past  ten  years  and  so  hope-
fully it will work in the case of ARPA–E.

The  third  goal  we  had  here  was  finding  a  way  to  clarify  how
ARPA–E would overcome the valley of death issues and so what we
provide for is a minimum of two and one-half percent allocation for
tech transfer and outreach activities and in addition applicants for
ARPA–E  projects  must  consider  future  commercial  applications  of
the  project  including  how  commercial  entities  could  be  included  to
help increase market application technology.

So  those  three  changes  are  what  is  in  the  amendment  and  I
would urge my colleagues to accept the amendment as an improve-
ment of ARPA–E.

Chairman  GORDON.  The  question  is  raised,  or  the  gentleman
raised  these  questions  at  the  Subcommittee  markup.  They  were
very  constructive.  We  worked  in  a  way  to  try  to  accomplish  that.

Again, you have made a good bill better and I recommend passage
of this amendment.

Ms. BIGGERT. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman GORDON. The gentlelady is recognized.
Ms. BIGGERT. I move to strike the last word.
Chairman  GORDON.  The  gentlelady  is  recognized  for  five  min-

utes.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  thank  the  Chairman.  I  am  sorry  to  say  that  I
strongly oppose this amendment by my colleague. While it purports
to protect the DOE Office of Science for at least one year, I actually
think it does no such thing, and that is really why I take issue with
this  amendment.  The  amendment  says  we  should  fund  ARPA–E
before  we  fund  the  DOE  Office  of  Science—or  that  we  should  fund
DOE before ARPA–E. I will give my colleague that much but where
does  it  set  the  bar?  It  sets  the  bar  at  the  level  of  the  fiscal  year
2007  budget  for  DOE  Office  of  Science  plus  inflation,  and  inflation
is currently somewhere between two and three percent, I think. So
this  sets  the  bar  so  low  that  if  you  are  not  looking  down,  you  will
trip over it. I think that as part of his American competitive initia-
tive, the President has proposed to double the funding for DOE Of-
fice  of  Science  over  ten  years.  In  his  fiscal  year  2007  budget  re-
quest  for  the  Office  of  Science,  the  President  requested  a  14  per-
cent  increase.  Congress  didn’t  give  it  to  him  so  we  are  already  be-
hind.  He  requested  a  16  percent  increase  in  fiscal  year  2008.
Whether  or  not  Congress  will  provide  that  increase  remains  to  be
seen,  and  I  certainly  hope  we  would,  especially  under  the  leader-
ship of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that we would
fund  it.  As  part  of  their  innovation  agenda,  they  have  advocated
doubling the budget for DOE Office of Science in half the time that
the President has proposed. So in fiscal year 2007, if Congress pro-
vides  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  only  an  inflationary  increase  and
then  starts  funneling  money  into  the  new  ARPA–E  bureaucracy,
that  is  sure  not  likely  to  fund  much  research  in  year  one.  So  I
think  that  this  Congress  would  have  failed  miserably,  and  we  will
have  failed  to  live  up  to  our  commitment  to  fund  the  ACI,  our
Democratic colleagues will have failed to live up to their innovation
agenda  and  we  will  have  failed  to  adequately  fund  research  in  the
physical sciences.

I have been one of the strongest advocates for the DOE Office of
Science since being elected to Congress in 1998, and why? Well, be-
cause when I arrived at Congress, I learned very quickly how much
we  underfunded  basic  research  in  the  physical  sciences.  Between
1994  and  2003,  spending  on  research  in  the  physical  sciences
shrank from 50 percent to less than 40 percent of the total federal
R&D  spending  as  Congress  put  more  money  into  the  life  sciences.
During  roughly  that  same  period,  the  DOE  Office  of  Science,  the
Nation’s  primary  supportive  research  in  the  physical  sciences,
funding  over  40  percent  of  basic  research  in  the  physical  sciences,
more than any other federal agency, had received flat funding. But
in constant dollars, its budget has been reduced by roughly 13 per-
cent.  Unfortunately,  the  research  itself  had  been  mostly  impacted
since  the  cost  to  maintain  existing  facilities  and  their  associated
staffs continued to rise with inflation. Only in recent years have we
made  some  progress  filling  this  hole.  But  we  won’t  see  real

progress  until  we  provide  the  increases  outlined  in  the  President’s
ACI  and  the  Democrats’  innovation  agenda.  These  are  the  in-
creases that the Augustine committee heartily endorsed and clearly
were  a  greater  priority  than  ARPA–E.  Increasing  the  Office  of
Science  budget  by  the  rate  of  inflation  just  won’t  cut  it  and  it
shouldn’t be where we set the bar for ARPA–E. I strongly urge my
colleagues to oppose the amendment.

I yield back the balance——
Mr. HALL. Will the gentlelady yield before she yields back?
Ms. BIGGERT. I will yield to the Ranking Member.
Mr. HALL. Is it your position that there is no adequate protection
for  the  Office  of  Science  in  that  they  provide  for  only  one  year  in
the threshold for funding?

Ms. BIGGERT. Are you asking me or Mr. Inglis?
Mr. HALL. Yes. Is that your position?
Ms. BIGGERT. That is my position.
Mr.  HALL.  And  do  you  not  have  an  amendment  a  little  bit  later

that addresses this?

Ms. BIGGERT. Yes, I do.
Mr.  HALL.  Okay.  I  don’t  think  we  ought  to—I  don’t  like  the  con-
cept  of  tying  the  hands  of  the  Director  or  the  Secretary  of  Energy
and I object to the amendment. I ask the Committee to vote no.

Chairman GORDON. If there is no further discussion, the vote will
be  on  the  amendment.  All  in  favor,  say  aye.  Aye.  Those  opposed,
say no. The ayes have it.

The  fourth  amendment  on  the  roster—let  us  see—is  from  the
gentlelady,  Ms.  Biggert.  Are  you  skipping  number  four  and  going

have the right one here.

Okay. My amendment is very straightforward. It simply requires
that  Congress  fully  fund  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of
Science  before  spending  billions  of  dollars  on  a  new,  untested
ARPA–E.

I  wish  I  could  say  that  I  came  up  with  this  idea,  but  I  didn’t.
Instead, the idea came directly from the Augustine Committee, the
group  responsible  for  writing  the  National  Academy  of  Science
Gathering Storm report on which the bill before us today is based,
purportedly.

In  testimony  before  this  committee  in  the  109th  Congress,  the
only  representative  of  the  Augustine  Committee  to  testify  before
this  committee  on  ARPA–E  concepts  said,  ‘‘In  funding  ARPA–E,  it
is  critical  that  this  funding  not  jeopardize  the  basic  research  sup-
ported  by  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science.  The  Com-
mittee’s  recommendations  are  priorities,  and  its  top  recommenda-

152

tion  in  the  area  of  research  is  to  increase  the  funding  of  basic  re-
search  by  10  percent  per  year  over  the  next  seven  years.  The  Au-
gustine  Committee  applauds  the  Administration’s  American  Com-
petitiveness  Initiative,  particularly  the  courageous  efforts  of  the
Secretary  of  Energy,  Samuel  Bodman,  to  make  basic  research  ac-
tivities  a  high  priority  in  the  Department  of  Energy  budget.  The
Augustine  report  strongly  recommends  the  support  of  ARPA–E
come  from  new  funding.’’  That  was  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Stephen
Chu on behalf of the Augustine Committee. I don’t think it can get
any clearer than that.

Supporting  over  40  percent  of  the  total  federal  funding  for  basic
research  in  the  physical  sciences,  more  than  any  other  federal
agency.  The  DOE  Office  of  Science  is  the  Nation’s  primary  sup-
porter  of  research  in  the  physical  sciences.  The  Office  of  Science
has led the way in creating a unique system of large-scale special-
ized  user  facilities  for  scientific  discovery.  The  collection  of  cutting
edge  one-of-a-kind  tools  makes  the  Office  of  Science  a  unique  and
critical component of the Federal Science Portfolio.

Other federal science agencies, such as the National Institutes of
Health  and  the  National  Science  Foundation,  greatly  depend  upon
these Office of Science facilities in carrying out their own research
activities. Under the President’s fiscal year 2008 budget, 21,500 re-
searchers would have access to these DOE facilities. Nearly half of
those  users  will  be  university  faculty  and  students.  Many  will  be
from  other  federal  agencies,  and  a  significant  number  will  be  from
U.S. industry.

Recognizing  the  importance  and  contributions  of  the  DOE  Office
of Science, President Bush made doubling its budget one of the pil-
lars  of  the  ACI.  And  my  democratic  colleagues,  as  I  said  before,
made  it  a  similar  priority  in  their  innovation  agenda,  proposing  to
double  its  funding  in  half  the  time  that  President  Bush  had  pro-
posed.  But  it  was  this  committee  that  recognized  the  crucial  role
that the Office of Science played in our Federal Research Portfolio,
long  before  it  became  part  of  any  initiative  or  agenda  of  either
party.  This  Committee  unanimously  approved  the  provisions  that
became  Title  9  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  including  a  provi-
sion that became Section 971 and authorized significant budget in-
creases for the DOE Office of Science. Congress approved these in-
creases with broad bipartisan support, and they are now law.

My amendment simply says that we should live up to the current
law first; law we made in this committee. We have been told by the
supporters  of  this  bill  that  it  is  consistent  with  the  recommenda-
tions of the Augustine Committee. We have also been told that the
funding for ARPA–E will be new funding. We have heard this over
and  over,  and  in  a  recent  hearing  on  ARPA–E,  during  the  Sub-
committee markup of this bill, and again today.

Well, if my colleagues who support the bill are being honest with
those  of  us  who  are  skeptical  that  there  are  billions  of  dollars  in
new  money  to  create  another  bureaucracy  within  the  DOE,  then
they  should  support  this  amendment.  By  supporting  this  amend-
ment,  we  are  not  saying  we  shouldn’t  create  ARPA–E;  rather,  by
supporting this amendment we are voting to reaffirm the priorities
established in the Augustine report. We are voting to make federal
funding for basic research a priority over funding for an idea to cre-

ate a new bureaucracy. By supporting this amendment, we are vot-
ing to ensure that money for this new bureaucracy doesn’t come at
the expense of our basic research programs. It is a simple decision,
really. What are our priorities?

So I urge adoption of the amendment and yield back the balance

of my time.

Chairman  GORDON.  Very  briefly,  the  gentlelady’s  good  faith
amendment  would  require  that  the  Office  of  Science  have  a  20.5
percent  increase  next  year,  20.5  percent  increase  before  ARPA–E
can take effect. That is simply not realistic, and is a killer amend-
ment for this bill.

If  there  is  no  further  discussion,  the  vote  will  be  on  the  amend-
ment.  All  in  favor,  say  aye.  Those  opposed,  say  no.  The  nos  have

Chairman  GORDON.  The  amendment  is  not  agreed  to.  The  fifth
amendment on the roster is offered by the gentlelady from Illinois,
Ms. Biggert. Are you ready to proceed with your amendment?

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  am,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  move  to  strike  the  last

word.

Illinois.

Chairman GORDON. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The CLERK. Amendment to H.R. 364 authored by Mrs. Biggert of

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with
the  reading.  Without  objection  so  ordered.  The  gentlelady  is  recog-
nized for five minutes to explain her amendment.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will try again.
This is another straightforward amendment. It strikes the provi-
sion  added  during  Subcommittee  markup  that  limits  to  eight  per-
cent the amount of ARPA–E Project funds that can be allocated to
Federally-Funded  Research  and  Development  Centers  or  FFRDCs.
This eight percent cap I think is absolutely arbitrary. The Gath-
ering Storm report said nothing about an eight percent cap. Instead
it  included  language  to  the  contrary,  and  I  quote.  ‘‘Solutions  will
require coordinated efforts among industrial, academic, and govern-
ment laboratories.’’ And one of ARPA–E’s purported benefits will be
to, and I quote, ‘‘foster consortia of companies, colleges, and univer-
sities, and laboratories to work on critical research problems.’’

Nor  do  I  recall  a  single  witness  who  testified  before  this  com-
mittee,  either  in  the  109th  Congress  or  more  recently  before  the
Energy and Environment Subcommittee ever suggesting, much less
advocating,  that  we  should  tie  the  hands  of  program  managers  by
limiting to eight percent the amount of ARPA–E funds available to
FFRDCs.  Correct  me  if  I  am  wrong  but  I  don’t  recall  a  single  one.
Dr.  Stephen  Chu,  the  only  member  of  the  Augustine  Committee
to  actually  testify  before  this  committee  about  ARPA–E,  rec-
ommended neither an eight percent cap nor tying the hands of the
program  managers  in  this  way.  And  he  also,  as  a  matter  of  fact,
said  quite  the  opposite.  ‘‘This  agency  would  itself  perform  no  re-
search that would fund work conducted by university start-ups, es-
tablished firms and National laboratories.’’ And he then went on to
say anyone could compete for funding from ARPA–E, including uni-
versities, industry, businesses, and National laboratories, or ideally
a consortium of these agencies.

So  while  the  member,  a  member  of  the  Augustine  Committee
gave  this  committee  clear  guidance,  the  bill  before  us  does  exactly
the  opposite  of  what  was  advised.  Instead  of  empowering  program
managers  to  be  independent,  the  bill  ties  the  hands  of  program
managers  before  the  agency  even  exists  by  telling  them  how  and
where  they  can  spend  ARPA–E  funds.  Instead  of  favoring  one
group  over  another,  the  bill  contains  an  arbitrary  limitation  that
places one group at a disadvantage compared to the others.

And if you think this arbitrary funding limitation only applies to
DOE  National  laboratories,  you  would  be  mistaken.  The  list  of
FFRDCs  is  actually  maintained  by  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion,  and  by  the  latest  count  there  are  actually  37  different
FFRDCs  spread  across  the  nine  different  departments,  including
the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and NASA.

All are eligible for ARPA–E funding but only eight percent of it ac-
cording to the bill as reported by the Subcommittee.

I would ask these questions of my colleagues from Arizona, Cali-
fornia,  Colorado,  Pennsylvania,  South  Carolina,  Illinois,  New  Jer-
sey, Tennessee, and Washington, all of which are home to FFRDCs,
and  are  you  sure  that  none  of  the  scientists  or  engineers  at  the
FFRDCs  in  your  state  have  an  idea  for  solving  our  nation’s  na-
tional  energy  challenges?  Are  you  sure  that  an  eight  percent  cap
isn’t going to prevent them from getting funding from ARPA–E for
this?  For  that  great  idea?  And  are  you  willing  to  risk  tying  the
hands of ARPA–E program managers in such a way as to preclude
them from funding that great idea?

If you are not, you should support this amendment, eliminate the
cap  and  the  funding  available  to  the  FFRDCs.  Make  the  ARPA–E
program  managers  truly  independent.  Leave  the  funding  decisions
to them and in doing so you will insure that this bill remains true
to  the  National  Academy’s  recommendation  that  ARPA–E  be  de-
signed as a lean, effective, and agile, but largely independent orga-
nization.

I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and yield

back the balance of my time.

Chairman GORDON. Mr. Hall is recognized.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  just  very  briefly.  She  describes  an
eight  percent  limitation.  That  is  not  in  line  with  the  Gathering
Storm  recommendations.  It  is  not  fair  to  the  labs.  They  ought  to
be  able  to  fight  for  funds  the  same  as  universities  or  private  com-
panies do. I urge the approval of the amendment.

Yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  Will  all  due  respect  this  another  killer
amendment,  and  if  there  is  no  further  discussion,  the  vote  occurs
on the amendment.

Chairman GORDON. The amendment fails. The sixth amendment
on the roster is offered by the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Biggert.
Are you ready to proceed with your amendment?

Let me ask the gentlelady does she have any more amendments,

and if so, please tell us which one.

Michigan.

Ms. BIGGERT. No, Mr. Chairman. Two is enough.
Chairman GORDON. Okay. Mr. Ehlers.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  might  just  at  some  point  I
would  like  to  know  why  these  are  killer  amendments,  but  we  can
discuss that later.

Chairman GORDON. I would be happy to tell you.
Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Ehlers is recognized.
Mr. EHLERS. I have an amendment at the desk.
Chairman GORDON. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The  CLERK.  Amendment  to  H.R.  364  authored  by  Mr.  Ehlers  of

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with
the reading. Without objection, so ordered. The gentleman is recog-
nized for five minutes to explain his amendment.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
When  the  Gathering  Storm  report  initially  suggested  creating
ARPA–E,  I  was  very,  very  skeptical  about  it.  I  wasn’t  sure  that  it
would work, and I thought the current Office of Science could take
on that responsibility.

What has changed my mind, and I now support it, is just think-
ing  back  historically  through  the  history  of  the  Department  of  En-
ergy. It has been plagued at various times by Secretaries of Energy
who  were  purely  political  appointees  who  knew  very  little  about
science  or  about  the  operation  of  the  Department.  And  as  a  result
of  preserving  that  historical  record,  I  decided  it  is  very  important
that we return back to what the Gathering Storm report originally
recommended,  and  that  is  that  ARPA–E  report  to  the  Under  Sec-
retary for Science rather than to the Secretary.

I  believe  it  is  very  important  that  the  agency  report  to  someone
who is a scientist and has a scientific background and can properly
defend their requests to the Department of Management and Budg-
et  and  that,  or  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  and  to  the
President.

And so I am offering an amendment to return the reporting line
to  what  was  recommended  in  the  Gathering  Storm  report,  largely
on  the  historical  basis  of  how  the  Department  has  been  run  and
how it has had hills and valleys over the years. As I mentioned ear-
lier, just pointing back to the decade of the ’90s, there was a series
of  Secretaries  who  had  very  little  if  any  knowledge  of  science  and
certainly  did  not  do  a  very  good  job  of  operating  the  Department
or setting priorities.

Now  that  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  elevated  the  position  of
the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science  to  the  Under  Secretary  level,
providing  the  Under  Secretary  the  necessary  authority  to  promote
the role of science and technology research and development at the
Department, I am convinced that it would be better for the ARPA–
E  agency  to  report  to  the  Under  Secretary  for  Science  rather  than
to the Secretary. And I feel very strongly about that.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:49 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00170 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

163

In  addition,  my  argument  is  strengthened  by  the  fact  that  Mr.
Augustine and the Gathering Storm report recommended the same
thing. I believe that creating a new agency focused expressly in the
development  of  innovative  energy  technologies  and  putting  it  out-
side the science missions of the Department underlines the author-
ity  of  the  Under  Secretary  for  Science.  In  fact,  the  authors  of  the
Gathering Storm included in their recommendation that the Direc-
tor of ARPA–E report to the Under Secretary, definitely not to the
Secretary of Energy.

So  I  strongly  urge  the  adoption  of  this.  I  think  it  will  improve
the  bill  and  will  make  it  a  more  workable  agency  as  a  result.  We
have  said  a  lot  here  this  morning  about  bureaucrats,  getting  bu-
reaucrats  out  of  the  way.  I  think  in  view  of  the  fact  that  we  want
to  avoid  bureaucracy,  it  is  best  to  have  them  reporting  directly  to
the  scientists  rather  than  to  a  Secretary,  who  is  frequently  not  a
scientist.

I want to make clear that my comments here do not refer to the
current Secretary of Energy, who I think is one of the best we have
had  in  a  long  time,  and  I  certainly  appreciate  Secretary  Bodman’s
work.  But  we  have  an  outstanding  Under  Secretary  of  Science  in
Dr.  Raymond  Orbach,  who  has  a  proven  record  as  both  a  scientist
and as an administrator.

And  so  at  this  point  especially  this  would  be  good,  but  I  think
if you look at the historical record, you will also agree it is best to
have the agency report to the Under Secretary of Science.

I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman GORDON. The gentleman yield?
Mr. EHLERS. Yes. I would be happy to yield.
Chairman  GORDON.  Let  me  say  to  the  gentleman,  there  is  no
question this is a good-faith amendment, and we did not receive it
until  this  afternoon  or  yesterday.  Was  it  yesterday?  Well,  we  re-
cently  received  it.  The  original  purpose  of  going  to  or  reporting  to
the Secretary was to try to get away from bureaucracy, to go to the
head of the stream so you wouldn’t get into any of that. I still think
that is probably a good idea.

I  am  going  to  oppose  this  amendment  today,  but  I  want  to  con-
tinue  to  talk  with  the  gentleman  before  we,  as  we  go  through  this
process. I may be wrong, you know, and but on short notice I think
it  does  streamline  it,  and  I  think  it  is  better  to  go  directly  to  it,
but  I  will  oppose  it,  but  as  I  say,  I  think  this  is  a  discussion  that
we  need  to  continue  to  have.  And  so  as  has  been  earlier  said  I  re-
luctantly oppose what I know is a good-faith amendment.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Reclaiming  my  time,  I  appreciate  those  comments.
I  would  point  out  that  it  was,  the  amendment  was  submitted  at
nine o’clock, 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday. We thought that would be ade-
quate time, and I think it is not only a good-faith amendment, but
it is a good amendment, and so I would appreciate everyone’s vote
on this particular amendment.

Chairman  GORDON.  Is  there  further  discussion  on  the  amend-

ment?

Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  would  just  note  that  Mr.,  Dr.  Ehlers  is
highly  respected  in  terms  of  his  understanding  of  science  and  how
science  works  and  how  it  works  in  this  system,  and  I  will  be  sup-

porting  him  in  that.  And  when  we  are  talking,  his  whole  theory  is
let  us  get  the,  make  sure  that  a  scientist  is  someone  who  is  being
reported to, and of course, we have a disagreement between the sci-
entists, and Mr. Chairman, I don’t believe that you are a scientist,
so I will be siding with the scientist.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  if  the  gentleman  would  yield,  I  do
know that if there is a disagreement between the Under Secretary
scientist  and  the  Secretary,  I  know  who  is  going  to  win  that  one.
So  with  no  further  discussion—oh,  yes,  there  is  further  discus-

sion. Ms. Biggert is recognized.

Ms. BIGGERT. I move to strike the last word.
Chairman GORDON. The lady is recognized for five minutes.
Ms. BIGGERT. I thank the gentleman. I couldn’t agree more with
my  colleague,  Dr.  Ehlers.  In  conjunction  with  Senator  Domenici
and  Senator  Bingaman  and  Secretary  Bodman  I  worked  very  hard
during  that  conference  on  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  to  create
the  position  of  Under  Secretary  of  Science  at  the  Department  of
Energy,  and  I  think  that  this  organizational  structure  is  working
to  bridge  the  gap  between  fundamental  discoveries  and  their  ap-
plied  use.  Dr.  Ray  Orbach,  a  former  Director  of  the  Office  of
Science and the first to fill this position, made a point to get quick-
ly  up  to  speed  on  applied  energy  technology  programs  as  soon  as
he  assumed  the  position  of  Under  Secretary.  And  why?  And  that
was  to  make  sure  that  the  Department’s  basic  research  programs
were  helping  the  Applied  Energy  Programs  overcome  fundamental
technical obstacles to the development and deployment of advanced
energy technologies.

I  think  the  Augustine  Committee  recognized  how  important  this
organizational  change  was  at  DOE,  and  that  is  why  they  were  ex-
plicit that the Director of ARPA–E should report to the Under Sec-
retary  of  Science.  And  in  my  opinion  the  Gathering  Storm  report
wasn’t  clear  about  a  lot  of  things,  but  the  witnesses  at  our  Sub-
committee  hearing  last  month  generally  agreed  the  ARPA–E  rec-
ommendation  was  more  vague,  but  this  is  one  of  the  things  that
was  quite  clear  in  the  report.  It  is  even  in  the  very  first  sentence,
the  action  item  at  the  beginning  of  the  recommendation.  So  this
bill  essentially  creates,  you  know,  without  it,  another  stovepipe
within  the  DOE  by  keeping  ARPA–E  totally  autonomous  from  the
Department’s basic and applied research programs, creating an un-
necessary bureaucracy.

So one way to avoid this stovepipe effect is for the Director to re-
port  to  the  Under  Secretary  of  Science,  and  I  would  urge  you,  you
know, to work with Dr. Ehlers, and I would yield to Dr. Ehlers.

Mr.  EHLERS.  I  thank  the  gentlelady  for  yielding.  I  apologize  to
the  Chairman  if  you  did  not  see  the  amendment  in  time  to  give  it
adequate consideration. I don’t, my goal is not to embarrass you by
defeating you here, and I don’t even know if I could, but if you sin-
cerely  believe  it  would  be  better  to  offer  it  as  a  manager’s  amend-
ment  on  the  Floor  or  some  other  assurance  that  this  will  receive
the consideration there or in Rules Committee, that is certainly an
option.  But  lacking  any  assurances  of  that,  then  I  would  like  to
proceed to a vote here.

So  I  would  appreciate  your  reaction  to  that.  I  certainly  am  not
trying to stir the pot or upset your game. I just want fair consider-
ation.

Chairman GORDON. If the gentleman will yield, clearly you have
nothing  but  the  best  intentions,  and  I  am  sure  if  the  amendment
was  filed  by  you,  it  is  an  error  on  our  part  by  not  getting  it  early.
I cannot promise to you that we will make this change, only that
we  will  consider  it  as  we  go  forward.  Again,  my  feeling  is  that  to
help reduce the bureaucracy by reporting directly to the Secretary,
you  are  going  to  have  less  bureaucracy,  and  as  a  practical  matter,
the  Secretary  is  going  to  overrule  any  Under  Secretary  if  they  are
not happy with it.

I  think  we’ll  discuss  it  more.  I  don’t  want  to  mislead  you  into
thinking  that  this  is  automatically  going  to  be  a  part  of  a  man-
ager’s  amendment.  I  would  suggest  if  you  want  to  vote  today,  you
should have a vote, because I can’t make that promise.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  recognize  you  can’t  make
that  promise,  but  I  don’t  want  to  take  the  time  for  a  roll  call  vote
if, in fact, we are going to continue our discussions on this.

Mr. HALL. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. EHLERS. Yes. I would be happy to yield.
Mr. HALL. Do you think this is more of a killer amendment than

Ms. Biggert’s are?

Chairman GORDON. No, it is not.
Mr. HALL. Then I recommend passage of the amendment.
Chairman GORDON. Is there further discussion? If there is no fur-
ther discussion, then the vote is on Mr. Ehlers’ amendment. All in
favor of the amendment say aye. Those opposed say no. It appears
the no’s have it, but would you like to have a show of hands? What
would you like to do?

Mr. EHLERS. A show of hands is adequate, I believe.
Chairman GORDON. Okay.
Mr. EHLERS. As long as we can each count.
Chairman GORDON. All right. That is a big assumption here, but
those  in  favor  please  raise  your  hand.  I  get  15.  All  opposed,  raise
your  hand.  And  I  believe  there  is  21.  If  there  is  no  disagreement,
then the amendment failed.

The eighth amendment on the roster is offered by the gentleman

from California, Mr. Bilbray. Are you ready to proceed?

The Clerk will report the amendment.
The CLERK. Amendment to H.R. 36——
Mr.  BILBRAY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  amendment  be  ac-

cepted as read.

to explain his amendment.

Chairman GORDON. The gentleman is recognized for five minutes

Mr. BILBRAY. Mr. Chairman, it is quite clear that the intent here
is  to  create  a  $14  million  or  I  mean,  $14  billion  new  vehicle.  All
my bill does is strike that money, basically places this in a position
of  making  some  priority  decisions  here.  Do  we  want  to  create  this
new  vehicle?  Do  we  want  to  have  it  separate  and  isolated?  And  it
basically  says  that  there  are  some  priority  decisions  to  be  made,
and those priority decisions I think up front ought to be that DOE,
the Office of Science, is going to be impacted one way or the other,
the  people  that  just  developed  the  new  lithium  battery  that  is  not

toxic, can handle high energy without creating hazardous problems
in  the  future,  that  we  need  to  make  some  priority  decisions.  And
this  bill  just  basically  strikes  the  funding  for  the  new  agency  and
the new group and basically says that in the tradition of the 1990s
when we required that if you wanted to create something new and
add something new, you had to find the money within the existing
structure.  My  motion  basically  does  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I
yield back.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Bilbray. I would just quickly
say  that  the  Bilbray  amendment  would  eliminate  funding  for
ARPA–E, effectively killing the program, and if there is no further
discussion——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Yes. Mr. Rohrabacher is recognized.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  would  suggest  that  if  Mr.  Bilbray’s  amend-
ment  is  adopted,  that  it  will  not  kill  the  idea,  that  instead  it  will
force us to set the priorities that we are supposed to set. If the ar-
gument  in  favor  of  ARPA–E  is  that  the  status  quo  currently  going
on  is  not  an  efficient  use  of  resources  and  thus,  a  restructuring  is
necessary,  we  should  have  the  courage  enough  to  say  what  pro-
grams are not an efficient use of the money and what in the status
quo isn’t worthy of financing and use that money to finance ARPA–
E.  Should  Mr.  Bilbray’s  amendment  not  be  accepted,  I  would,  of
course,  be  planning  to  move  forward  on  the  Floor  with  an  amend-
ment that will accomplish just that.

If we do believe that this is a necessary restructuring, we should
have  the  courage  to  say  why  it  is  necessary  by  eliminating  those
things  that  are  costing  money  that  aren’t  cost  effective,  that  are
currently being spent on. And this idea of just shoving it off to the
oil  companies,  which,  I,  again,  voted  against  that  particular  sub-
sidy, tax-incentive subsidy, but that is just a way of getting around
trying  to  set  priorities  and  doing  the  tough  job  that  we  are  sup-
posed to do here.

So I would suggest Mr. Bilbray’s amendment is going in the right
direction  and  forcing  us  to  try  to  make  set  priorities  and  get  rid
of  failing  programs,  if,  indeed,  the  status  quo  isn’t  working,  which
is  the  premise  of  this  whole  argument,  and  I  support  that,  by  the
way. I support that concept. Let us have courage enough to defund
those projects that aren’t working.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Bilbray.  I  mean,  Mr.  Rohr-
abacher.  I  am  afraid  there  won’t  be  a  majority  courage  to  get  that
done,  and  so  if  there  is  no  further  discussion,  all  in  favor  of  the
amendment say aye. All opposed say no. The no’s have it.

The  9th  amendment  on  the  roster  is  offered  by  the  gentleman
from  Nebraska,  Mr.  Smith.  Are  you  ready  to  proceed  with  your
amendment?

Mr. SMITH OF NEBRASKA. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.

Mr.  SMITH OF NEBRASKA.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Mem-
bers.  My  amendment  would  transfer  all  of  the  funds,  the  relevant
funds and projects to the appropriate programs at DOE. If a study
required  under  Section  1821  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005, con-
cludes  that  ARPA–E  should  not  be  established,  the  study  man-
dated under Section 1821 of EPA would look at the applicability of
the management practices used by the Department of Defense, Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, to research programs at
the Department of Energy and the advisability of creating an agen-
cy within DOE modeled after DARPA. A National Academy of Pub-
lic  Administration,  an  independent  and  non-partisan  organization.
I  would  emphasize  an  independent  and  non-partisan  organization
is charged with carrying out this study.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  extremely  concerned  about  the  creation  of
a  new  bureaucracy  and  possible  waste  of  taxpayer  dollars  should
ARPA–E be established without fully addressing whether this new
agency  is  the  most  effective  tool  for  delivering  new  technologies  to
the marketplace.

Therefore,  I  believe  it  would  be  beneficial  to  have  the  Academy
of  Public  Administration’s  recommendation  on  whether  it  is  even
advisable  to  create  a  new  agency.  Should  the  Academy’s  findings
reflect  negatively  on  the  establishment  of  ARPA–E,  the  agency
would be terminated, and all funds would be directed to the appro-
priate  programs  within  the  Department  of  Energy.  We  have  heard
several times this morning that various amendments may be killer
amendments. Certainly this one is not a killer amendment. It sim-
ply  defers  to  an  independent,  non-partisan  organization  for  their
recommendations.

Also, I would suggest that the approach of a new agency, perhaps
taking  dollars  from  other  projects,  is  indeed  a  continuation  of  the
status  quo.  I  hope  that  this  inclusion  of  an  independent  organiza-
tion’s opinion would lead to favorable public policy and wise use of
taxpayer dollars.

I yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  With  all  due  respect  let  me  repeat  what  I
said  earlier.  Again,  this  is  a  killer  amendment,  and  the  reason  it
is  a  killer  amendment,  this  same  amendment  was  passed  by  the
Congress, signed by the President, requiring the Department of En-
ergy  to  do  this  study  and  send  it  to  Congress  by  January  of  2007.
The Department of Energy has yet to even put it out for study, you
know,  so  if  you  are  going  to,  and  this  was  one  of  Mr.  Hall’s  big
‘‘shalls.’’ The Department shall do that, but they did not do it. They
didn’t  do  it  then,  there  is  no  reason  that  says  they  are  going  to  do
it again, and so this is a killer amendment.

And,  again,  it  is  a  demonstration  of  ineptitude,  I  think,  within
the Department of Energy when they are flaunting themselves and
not doing the will of the Congress.

Mr. Bilbray.
Mr.  BILBRAY.  Mr.  Chairman,  pardon  me  if  I  am  wrong,  but  the
gentleman from Nebraska has given you, you know, you say let us
jump, let us move now, and he is creating a parachute for you that
says only if it is a long haul, only if the report comes out and says
there  is  a  problem,  you  know,  the  fact  is  that  you  are  saying  the
study  doesn’t  come  out,  doesn’t  say  it  is  a  problem,  it  is  going  to

kill the bill. He is giving you a safety valve where the fact is if the
experts  in  the  field  come  back  after  we  have  moved  ahead  and
says, you have got major problems, that gives you a fallback to say,
okay,  let  us  do  a  rethink,  but  only  if  they  come  out  and  say  that.
Not beforehand.

So in all fairness I think the gentleman from Nebraska is trying
to  be  more  than  accommodating  to  your  original  legislation  that
creates  a  safety  escape  hatch  in  case  the  people  on  the  front  line
say  this  could  be  a  major  disaster.  And  so  it  actually  could  rein-
force  your  argument  for  moving  forward  now  because  you  do  have
that parachute in the back. So the gentleman from Nebraska seems
like  he  is  trying  to  accommodate  your  intention  of  moving  forward
while  still  guaranteeing  some  protection  for  the  taxpayers  and  for
the consumer that needs this technology moving forward.

And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. HALL. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. BILBRAY. I yield.
Mr.  HALL.  You  are  saying  it  is  not  a  killer,  just  allows  the  pro-

gram to move forward, aren’t you?

Mr. ROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Yes, Mr. Rothman.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To just respond to my
distinguished  colleague’s  remarks  from  the  other  side,  sometimes
as  we  all  know  people  of  goodwill  and  positions  of  power  use  their
positions  to  thwart  opposing  ideologies  or  opposing  approaches  to
problems  simply  by,  well,  by  various  means  including  delay,  pas-
sive aggression, whatever you want to call it. And I think what our
Chairman has indicated is that the Department of Energy has used
its power to thwart reforms in the past, even those directed by the
Congress through delay.

And  so  while  one  may  view  the  gentleman’s  amendment  as  sim-
ply an opportunity to provide for what he describes as a parachute,
or it has been described as a parachute, in the eyes of others would
simply  be  enabling  an  agency  of  this  Administration  that  has  re-
sisted the will and thwarted the will of the Congress to deny them
an opportunity to do so again.

So I would respectfully oppose this amendment.
Chairman GORDON. If there is no—Mr. Smith is recognized.
Mr.  SMITH OF NEBRASKA.  Move  to  strike  the  last  word.  I  would
point  out  that  if  there  is  a  delay  of  the  study,  this  agency  con-
tinues. I mean, I think I heard the Chairman say that the Depart-
ment has delayed various studies and so forth. If that takes place,
this  new  agency  continues,  and  it  is  only  if  the  study  takes  place
and  finds  very  objectively  that  the  agency  is  unnecessary  and  that
taxpayer  dollars  could  be  better  spent  elsewhere,  then  the  dollars
could be spent elsewhere in accordance with the study.

Mr. ROTHMAN. If the gentleman would yield.
Mr. SMITH OF NEBRASKA. Yes.
Mr. ROTHMAN. I thank the gentleman. Is it the usual occurrence
when  a  new  project  is  suggested  to  begin  that  at  the  same  time
funds  are  authorized  to  then  study  whether  the  project  is  worth-
while?

Mr.  SMITH OF NEBRASKA.  Oftentimes  projects  have  sunset
clauses. Mine is basically only a sunset if the study concludes that
it should sunset. Otherwise it continues indefinitely.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  If  the  gentleman  would  continue  to  yield.  I  think
that,  you  know,  one  might  argue  that  in  which  branch  of  govern-
ment the decision about whether to continue a program should con-
tinue  and  to  leave  it  in  the  hands  of  this  administration  to  decide
that a Congressionally-authorized and approved program must end
I  think  would  be  the  wrong  approach.  I  think  certainly  if  the  Ad-
ministration,  for  whatever  reason,  presented  evidence  to  the  Con-
gress  that  something  we  were  doing  here  in  the  Congress  was
wasteful  or  wrong,  the  majority  of  us  on  each  side  of  the  aisle
would respond appropriately.

I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr.  SMITH OF NEBRASKA.  I  appreciate  your  concern.  I  would  say
from my experience in public policy that a lot of new programs are
started  with  the  best  of  intentions  and  are  continued  with  more
and  more  dollars  with  newly-developed  constituencies  perhaps  hi-
jacking  various  programs.  I  am  not  accusing  this  project  imme-
diately of such violations.

I  would  say,  however,  deferring  to  the  independent  organization
such  as  the  Public  Administration,  Academy  of  Public  Administra-
tion,  a  very  well-respected  organization  that  does  a  very  nice  job
of staying above the political fray, especially in a nonpartisan man-
ner, that getting their input on this is wise and I think very appro-
priate.

I yield back.

on  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska’s  amendment.  All  in  favor  say

Chairman GORDON. The amendment is not carried.
The  tenth  amendment  on  the  roster  is  offered  by  the  gentleman
from  Georgia,  Mr.  Gingrey.  Are  you  ready  to  proceed  with  your
amendment?

Mr. GINGREY. I am, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the

desk.

Georgia.

Chairman GORDON. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The  CLERK.  Amendment  to  H.R.  364  offered  by  Mr.  Gingrey  of

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with
the reading. Without objection so ordered. The gentleman is recog-
nized for five minutes to explain his amendment.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  If  you  didn’t  like  the
amendment  submitted  by  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska,  Mr.
Smith, you are really going to hate this one, Mr. Chairman.

But I think it is an amendment that maybe is more logical to all
the  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle.  Basically  EPAct  2005,  En-
ergy Policy Act 2005, in Section 1821, that is why it is some similar
to  Mr.  Smith’s  amendment,  call  for  the  study  to  say,  to  ask  the
question  would  ARPA–E,  we  were  playing  with  those  acronyms  a
little earlier, but the Advanced Project Research Act, under the De-
partment  of  Energy,  would  it  fit,  would  it  be  as  successful  as  the
DARPA  Program  under  the  Department  of  Defense,  which,  of
course,  has  existed  for  50  years  or  more  and  has  a  fantastic  track
record.

I  submit,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  maybe  it  is  not  analogous  to  that
program  in  that  under  DARPA  there  is  a  ready-made  customer,
and  of  course,  that  is  our  military.  And  many  of  the  studies  that
are done by DARPA, there is this opportunity to immediately apply
technology to the field, if you will. But that is not actually the way
it  would  occur  with  a  similar  program  under  the  Department  of
Energy.  There  may  be  no  market,  and  I  suggest  that  for  that  rea-
son  that  a  study  before  we  authorize  $5  billion  over  five  years  for
a  new  program,  that  this  study  under  Section  1821  of  the  Energy
Policy Act of 2005 is supposed to be done, in fact, five months ago,
January  of  ’07.  And  that  this  is  the  right  way  to  do  things.  This
is the right way to spend the people’s money to make sure that just
a  few  pages  out  of  a  very  thick  volume,  the  rise  of  the  Gathering
Storm report, which doesn’t really get very specific.

So  I  think  it  is  very  appropriate  in  EPAct  2005,  that  this  study
be done before we go ahead and spend the money. That is how my
amendment,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  different  from  the  Smith  amend-
ment. His amendment says, well, you know, you go ahead and start
the  program,  you  start  the  funding,  and  if  and  when  the  study  fi-
nally  gets  done  and  it  shows  that  it  is  not  a  worthwhile  project,
then you stop the funding.

My amendment simply says you don’t start the funding until you
do  the  study.  If  you  go  ahead  and  start  the  program  without  the
study, it is like scheduling a wedding before you pick the bride and
groom.  So  I  think  it  is  just  a  very  logical  amendment,  and  it  is  a
commonsense, fiscally responsible amendment.

I  don’t  mind  seeing  government  grow  if  there  is  a  good  reason
for  it,  but  I  think  that  the  study  should  be  done  before  we  start
spending the money, and I will yield back my time.

Mr. HALL. Will the gentleman yield.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Hall is recognized.
Mr.  HALL.  Actually,  you  just  conditioned  the  establishment  of
ARPA–E on a positive recommendation which was made in the En-
ergy Policy Act. Right?

Mr. GINGREY. That is correct, Mr. Hall.
Mr. HALL. I urge the adoption of the amendment.
Chairman  GORDON.  I  will  be  very  brief  and  say  that  the  gen-
tleman, my friend from Georgia correctly described my view of this
amendment.  I  mean,  you  know,  it  is,  we  talk  about  this  a  lot,  so
I  am  starting  to  be  repetitious  on  this.  But  keep  in  mind  the  De-
partment  of  Energy  by  law  passed  by  Congress,  signed  by  the
President  was  required  with  a  big  shall,  was  required  to  do  this
study  and  present  it  to  Congress.  I  have  written  them  myself  ask-
ing  for  it.  They  have  not  even  commissioned  it.  I  mean,  you  know,
if  that  is,  you  know,  it  is  just  not  a  credible  approach,  and  so  if
there  is  no  further  discussion,  we  will  have  a  vote  on  the  amend-
ment.

All  in  favor  of  Mr.  Gingrey’s  amendment  say  aye.  Opposed,  nay.

Chairman GORDON. The amendment fails.
The  eleventh  amendment  on  the  roster  is  offered  by  the  gen-
tleman  from  Missouri,  Mr.  Akin.  Are  you  ready  to  proceed  with
your amendment?

Mr.  AKIN.  I  am,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  have  to  say  to  start  out

the whole idea of ARPA–E’s——

Chairman GORDON. If I could, my mistake. The Clerk will report

The CLERK. Amendment to H.R. 364 offered by Mr. Akin of Mis-

the amendment.

souri.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with
the reading. Without objection, so ordered. The gentleman is recog-
nized for five minutes to explain his amendment.

Mr.  AKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  was  inclined  to  really  like  your  bill,
because  I  like  Arby’s.  They  have  roast  beef  sandwiches  and  milk-
shakes there, and I thought it was going to be a pretty good thing,
but  now  I  understand  we  got  a  $4.9  billion  program  going  to  run
for  five  years.  Mr.  Chairman,  my  amendment  simply  says  at  the
end  of  five  years,  we  are  going  to  sunset.  In  other  words,  we  are
going  to  take  a  look,  and  if  the  program  did  what  you  wanted  it
to  do,  then  we  can  proceed.  If  it  suggests  that  maybe  it  should  be
folded into a different agency or bureau or something like that, we
could make those changes. But we just take a good look at it.

My impression, Mr. Chairman, is that five years or four years or
three  years,  even  one  year  from  this  day  there  is  no  one  in  this
committee  that  will  remember  we  did  this  other  than  perhaps  you
as  the  Chairman.  And  so  five  years  out  I  think  maybe  this  thing
could  take  a  review.  We  would  then  assess  whether  it  has  really
worked or not.

So,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  just  seems  to  me  to  make  sense  why  not
subject it to a review five years out. I just wanted to know, I would
yield to you, what you think about that idea.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you.  I  hope  our  kids  will  remember

this, and I hope they remember it gratefully and fondly.

Let  me  respond  by  saying  the  current  bill  already  states  that
after  54  months,  not  60,  but  after  54  months  the  President’s  Com-
mittee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  evaluate  ARPA–E  and  in-
clude  a  recommendation  on  whether  it  should  be  continued  or  ter-
minated. Congress then can act on those recommendations, on that
recommendation.

Mr. AKIN. So you are assuming it is going to be continued unless

it is terminated.

Chairman GORDON. No, no, no. We are saying that, well——
Mr. AKIN. If we didn’t take any action on their recommendation,

then it would continue. Correct?

Chairman GORDON. Yes. It leaves, again, it is stated clearly after
54  months  the  President’s  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
will  evaluate  ARPA–E  and  include  a  recommendation  on  whether
it should be continued or terminated. Congress can then act on the
recommendation.

Mr. AKIN. But my amendment would have been the converse. We
would  stop  it  unless  we  thought  it  was  good.  Now,  I  assume  that
you  would  really  like  that  idea  more  than  this  other  approach.  Is
that correct, Mr. Chairman?

Chairman  GORDON.  I  think  the  appropriate  approach  is,  again,
after 54 months, having a thorough review by a qualified operation.
Mr.  AKIN.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  could  interrupt.  Am  I  reading  be-
tween  the  lines  that  you  probably  wouldn’t  support  my  amend-
ment?

Chairman GORDON. You are very insightful.
Mr.  AKIN.  And  being  a  person  of  some  statistical  savvy  and  see-
ing how the previous votes have gone, would it be alright if I don’t
ask for a roll call vote?

Chairman  GORDON.  I  would  add  to  those  accolades  courteous,

too.

Mr.  AKIN.  Then,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would,  unless  there  is  further

discussion, proceed to a voice vote and move on with the day.

Chairman GORDON. All in favor of the——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Rohrabacher is recognized.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  just  want  to  make  sure  I  am  on  the  record
in  supporting  Mr.  Akin’s  amendment,  because  even  though  I  am
very  supportive  of  this  concept,  ARPA–E,  I  think  that  it  is  incum-
bent upon us to say that we will have to reaffirm that this program
is  working  after  a  given  time  period.  60  months  being  a  good  time
period, suggests five years, that we should have to make a positive
act  to  reaffirm  that  this  deserves  the  taxpayers’  money  and  is  an
effective restructuring that is taking place.

So  I  would  think  Mr.  Akin’s  suggestion  is  a  very,  very  positive
one,  and  if  we  really  believe  in  what  we  are  doing,  this  is  exactly
the type of measure that we should have in all of the changes that
we  make,  that  we  have  to  reaffirm  that  they  have  been  positive
changes or that they go out of existence.

Thank you very much.
Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  gentleman  would  yield  very  quickly,
this  really,  we  are  trying  to  accomplish  the  same  thing  in  that
there should be a review. I think we are looking at it in a real po-
litical sense. Right now as you very well know we could have a ma-
jority of the Congress that thinks this is a good program, but if one
person  in  the  Senate  decides  to  put  a  hold,  and  we  have  to  make
an affirmative vote, that vote may never come up. Even if it is not
with  a  hold,  you  know,  less  than  a  majority  can  stop  something
from coming up there.

So  it  is  just,  again,  we  are  trying  to  accomplish  the  same  thing
in that clearly if it is not a good bill and a good program, it should
stop, just like the managers have the authority if there is a specific
research program that is going on, to terminate it. But I think the
political reality is that a majority of the Congress can support this
program yet the will of that majority might not be heard.

So  if  there  is  no  further  discussion,  all  in  favor  of  the  gentle-

man’s amendment say aye. Opposed nay. The amendment fails.

The twelfth amendment on the roster is offered by the gentleman
from  Florida,  Mr.  Diaz-Balart.  Are  you  ready  to  proceed  with  your
amendment?

Mr.  MCCAUL.  I  am  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you  for  extending
the  courtesy  of  allowing  me  to  speak  for  the  gentleman  from  Flor-
ida.

The amendment simply——

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with
the reading. Without objection so ordered. The gentleman is recog-
nized for five minutes to explain his amendment.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  This  amendment  sim-
ply  sunsets  ARPA–E  after  five  years  if  importation  of  foreign  en-
ergy  sources  is  not  reduced  by  at  least  five  percent.  A  reduction  of
five percent is a modest and very achievable goal. If the goal is not
reached, or, I am sorry, if the goal is reached, then ARPA–E would
be  sunseted  after  10  years  if  importation  of  foreign  energy  sources
is not reduced by at least 20 percent.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  amendment  just  reinstates  the  goals  of  the
original  bill  before  that  language  was  removed  at  the  Sub-
committee  markup  two  weeks  ago.  This  reduction  would  be  cer-
tified by the Under Secretary of Energy and Science in coordination
with the Energy Information Administration.

I  am  concerned  that  we  are  creating  a  brand  new,  billion  dollar
agency without any form of accountability. This amendment simply
gives  this  new  agency  clear  and  measurable  goals.  It  establishes
benchmarks  that  are  consistent  with  one  of  the  main  goals  of  the
program;  to  reduce  America’s  dependence  on  foreign  sources  of  en-
ergy. It holds the program accountable for tangible results and pro-
tects the taxpayers from unnecessary and wasteful spending.

And with that I yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  Is  there  further  discussion  on  the  amend-

If  not,  all  of  those  in  favor  of  the  amendment  say  aye.  All  op-

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  I  won’t  take  five

This is a friendly amendment. I hope the Chairman and the Ma-
jority  Members,  as  well  as  the  Minority  will  like  this  amendment.
It  is  a  little  misleading.  It  says  it  inserts  a  savings  clause.  Typi-
cally  when  you  talk  about  savings,  you  are  talking  about  cutting
something.  In  this  instance,  of  course,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  basically
says that the authorities granted by this Act are in addition to the
existing authorities granted to the Secretary of Energy and not in-
tended to supersede or modify any existing authorities.

In  other  words,  I  want  to  make  sure  that  the  program  is  a  good
program  within  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  Office  of  Science.
We  all  agree,  I  think,  that  Secretary  Bodman  is  doing  an  out-
standing job. We don’t want to cut into the muscle of programs that
are already working well and make sure that the language is clear
that this is an additional program and not to take away from exist-
ing programs.

Chairman  GORDON.  Mr.  Gingrey,  I  think  this  is  lucky  13,  and  it
is  appropriate  that  we  conclude  our  amendments  today  with  what
I hope will be a unanimous vote for your amendment.

And let me point out that I know that the Minority was not suc-
cessful  on  a  variety  of  amendments  today,  but  they  were  also  suc-
cessful  on  some  earlier.  There  were  lots  of  discussions,  lots  of  the
suggestions  were  put  into  this  bill,  so  do  not  think  this  is  not,  I
mean, this bill has lots of mothers and fathers.

And so with that I will call a vote.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Yes, Mr. Rohrabacher.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  hate  to  be  the  skunk  at  the  lawn  party

here, but——

Chairman GORDON. Well, you have before so go ahead.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.—it  isn’t  unanimous.  This  is  exactly  the
wrong  way  to  go.  This  is  exactly  the  wrong  way  to  go.  If  we  are
saying  that  the  current  structure  does  not  work,  we  should  not  be
saying  that  the  current  structure  will  not  be  touched,  and  this  is
just  an  addition.  So  we  are  just  adding  more  spending  onto  some-
thing  that  has  failed.  If  it  has  failed,  we  need  something  else,  we
need  restructuring.  Let  us  take  it  from  where  it  has  failed,  and
again,  I  will  have  to  say  that  I  agree  with  the  concept  of  restruc-
turing,  creating  ARPA–E,  because  I  don’t  believe  the  current  sys-
tem  is  working,  and  it  is  overly  bureaucratic.  It  is  overtly  an  old
boy network spread throughout the scientific community on energy
research. We need to break through that and to have some real re-

form  here.  Just  suggesting  that  we  are  not  going  to  touch  the
system——

Mr. GINGREY. If the gentleman would yield.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.—this  is  counter  to  what  we  are  trying  to  do

here. So I oppose this.

Mr.  GINGREY.  If  the  gentleman  would  yield  to  me,  Mr.  Rohr-
abacher,  and  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  yielding.  And  let  me  just
say that, you know, the final vote here in Committee has not been
taken  on  this  bill,  and  I  at  the  outset  suggested  that  maybe  this
program  was  not  needed.  And  I  still  feel  that  way,  and  that  will
become obvious when the final vote is taken, although I have great
respect, great respect for our Chairman and most of the time I am
going  to  be  supportive  of  much  of  his  legislation  as  I  have  been  so
far in the 110th.

But what this amendment basically says is if this bill does pass,
which I think those of us on this side of the aisle can count, it very
likely  will  pass,  but  in  that  event  I  certainly  don’t  want  to  have
this  funding  to  cut  into  the  meat  of  the  overall  Department  of  En-
ergy budget. That is the reason.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  that  is  clearly  your  intent,  and  that  is
clearly  the  wrong  direction  to  go,  and  I  am  sorry.  If  you  have  got
a  reason  to  create  restructuring  within  Department  of  Energy,  we
should  be  restructuring  it  by  defunding  those  things  that  aren’t
working  well  and  not  just  adding  more  spending  onto  programs
that have failed.
So I would——
Chairman GORDON. Would the gentleman yield?
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—I just want to be on the record.
Chairman GORDON. If the gentleman from California would yield,
let  me  suggest  that  you  don’t  smell  quite  as  bad  as  you  point  out,
in  that  we  are  not  doing  our  job.  I  think  there  are  probably  some
things  at  the  Department  of  Energy  that  aren’t  as  good  as  they
should be.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Chairman  GORDON.  We  are  not  doing  our  job  here  in  oversight
if  we  don’t  look  into  that,  and  I  think  that  as  this  committee,  I
don’t  want  to  acquiesce  that.  We  should  look  at  it.  If  there  are
some things that aren’t being good, it is our job to point it out and
do something about it. And I hope that we will do that.

Mr. GINGREY. Thank you.
Chairman  GORDON.  And  so  all  in  favor  say  aye.  Opposed.  The

ayes have it.

Are  there  other  amendments?  If  not  then  the  vote  is  on  the  bill,
H.R.  364  as  amended.  All  in  favor  will  say  aye.  All  opposed  no.  In
the opinion of the Chair the ayes have it.

Chairman GORDON. The bill passes. Mr. Hall is recognized.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  the  way  you
have  conducted  this.  As  the  gentleman,  Dr.  Gingrey  said,  we  can
count, and we can count each of these times, and actually about the
only  excitement  we  have  had  here  today  is  when  Ms.  Deborah
would call for the gentleman from Louisiana to vote.

But  we  like  the  direction  we  are  going.  We  don’t  like  the  fact
that  you  have  another  agency,  the  money  spending,  but  we  thank
you  for  your  courtesy  and  your  generosity  in  the  way  you  handle
the gavel.

Yield back.
Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  I  wish  this  could  have
been a unanimous vote, but it was a unanimous work in that both
at  the  Subcommittee  level,  working  together  all  through.  I  think
that we have a better bill, and I am glad it is a bipartisan bill, and
I  want  Dr.  Ehlers  and  anyone  else  to  know  that  we  will  continue
our  conversation  to  have  the  very  best  bill  we  can  through  going
to the Floor and going through conference.

I now recognize Mr. Lampson to offer a motion.
Mr.  LAMPSON.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Committee  favor-
ably  report  H.R.  364  as  amended  to  the  House  with  the  rec-
ommendation that the bill do pass.

Furthermore,  I  move  that  the  staff  be  instructed  to  prepare  the
legislative report and make the necessary technical and conforming
changes  and  that  the  Chairman  take  all  necessary  steps  to  bring
the bill before the House for consideration.

Chairman  GORDON.  The  question  is  on  the  motion  to  report  the
bill  favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by  saying
aye.  Opposed  no.  The  ayes  have  it,  and  the  bill  is  favorably  re-
ported.

Without objection the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I move that Members have two subsequent calendar days in which
to submit supplemental, minority, or additional views on the meas-
ure.

I move pursuant to Clause 1 of Rule 22 of the Rules of the House
of  Representatives  that  the  Committee  authorize  the  Chairman  to
offer such motions as may be necessary in the House to adopt and
pass  H.R.  364,  To  provide  for  the  establishment  of  Advanced  Re-
search Projects Agency–Energy, as amended.

Without  objection,  so  ordered.  And  once  again,  I  want  to  thank
the  Members  for  your  patience.  I  know  there  are  lots  of  markups
going  on.  We  have  three  more  bills  which  I  hope  will  be  unani-
mous, and we will now proceed to those.

Many  thanks  to  everyone,  and  I  want  to  conclude  this  markup.
[Whereupon, at 1:00 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT

REPORT FROM SUBCOMMITTEE MARKUP

MAY 10, 2007

H.R. 364, To provide for the establishment of the Advanced

Research Projects Agency–Energy

I. Purpose

The  purpose  of  the  bill  is  to  establish  within  the  Department  of  Energy,  the  Ad-
vanced  Research  Projects  Agency–Energy  (ARPA–E),  and  set  up  an  Energy  Inde-
pendence Acceleration Fund to conduct activities under the Act.
II. Background and Need for Legislation

H.R.  364  follows  on  the  recommendation  of  the  National  Academies  2005  report,
Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  also  known  as  the  ‘‘Augustine  Report’’  for  its
Chair,  retired  Lockheed  Martin  CEO  Norman  Augustine.  This  report  called  on  the
Federal  Government  to  create  a  new  energy  research  agency  within  Department  of
Energy  patterned  loosely  on  the  successful  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects
Agency  (DARPA)  within  the  Department  of  Defense.  According  to  the  Gathering
Storm  report,  ARPA–E  should  be  structured  to  ‘‘sponsor  creative,  out-of-the-box,
transformational,  generic  energy  research  in  those  areas  where  industry  itself  can-
not  or  will  not  undertake  such  sponsorships,  where  risks  and  potential  payoffs  are
high,  and  where  success  could  provide  dramatic  benefits  for  the  Nation.  ARPA–E
would accelerate the process by which research is transformed to address economic,
environmental,  and  security  issues.  It  would  be  designed  as  a  lean,  effective,  and
agile—but  largely  independent—organization  that  can  start  and  stop  targeted  pro-
grams based on performance and ultimate relevance.’’

The  primary  motivations  for  establishing  an  ARPA–E  are  the  need  for  the  U.S.
to obtain more energy from domestic sources, become more energy efficient, and be-
come less reliant on energy sources and technologies that have an adverse effect on
the  environment.  The  push  for  new  technologies  is  especially  urgent  given  the  geo-
political  forces  that  threaten  global  energy  supplies  and  economic  stability,  the
looming  threat  of  global  climate  change,  and  probable  regulation  of  carbon  dioxide
emissions.  In  addition  to  addressing  the  Nation’s  energy  challenges,  the  Gathering
Storm  report  also  concluded  that  ARPA–E  will  contribute  to  U.S.  competitiveness
by  playing  an  important  role  in  ‘‘advancing  research  in  engineering,  the  physical
sciences,  and  mathematics;  and  in  developing  the  next  generation  of  researchers.’’
While  isolated  elements  in  the  national  labs,  industry,  and  academia  have  collabo-
rated with varying degrees of success, there is currently no federal program charged
with  bringing  these  elements  together  and  seeding  a  strong  and  cohesive  domestic
community  of  researchers  and  technology  developers  focused  on  pushing  trans-
formational energy solutions into the marketplace. ARPA–E is intended to play this
critical role.

To  pursue  truly  transformational  research  ARPA–E  will  utilize  an  organizational
structure  that  is  fundamentally  different  from  that  of  the  traditional  energy  re-
search  enterprise.  Critics  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s  management  of  research
programs  contend  that  the  stove-piped  and  bureaucratic  structure  of  DOE  is  not
conducive to the quick development of cross-cutting energy solutions, or translating
energy  research  results  into  commercial  technologies.  ARPA–E  will  instead  have  a
relatively  flat  and  nimble  organization,  similar  to  the  small,  flexible,  non-hier-
archical  reporting  structure  at  DARPA  that  fostered  a  successful  culture  of  innova-
tion.  Because  the  director  of  ARPA–E  reports  directly  to  the  Secretary  of  Energy,
it is not beholden to any one particular technology area or research program within
DOE.  Furthermore,  changes  were  made  in  Subcommittee  to  ensure  that  no  other
programs  within  DOE  report  to  ARPA–E.  These  two  factors  ensure  that  ARPA–E
has  a  unique  independence  within  DOE,  and  does  not  add  another  ‘‘layer’’  to  the
DOE  bureaucracy,  especially  since  bureaucratic  impediments  are  the  main  thing  it
seeks to avoid.

ARPA–E’s  unique  function  is  best  described  as  that  of  a  ‘‘marriage  broker’’  that
can  identify  people  and  capabilities  within  industry,  universities,  and  the  national
labs,  and  assemble  hybrid  research  teams  to  quickly  develop  novel  solutions  to
pressing  energy  problems.  Key  to  this  function  is  the  Program  Manager.  As  with
DARPA, these individuals would ostensibly be very talented, knowledgeable, experi-
enced  in  industry  or  academia,  and  passionate  in  pursuit  of  their  mission.  Because

193

of the flexible hiring authority that is written into Section 2 of the bill, talented Pro-
gram Managers can be recruited from a variety of fields, hired for a term of approxi-
mately  three  years,  and  paid  a  salary  commensurate  with  what  they  would  make
in the private sector. The initial start-up staff of ARPA–E will be crucial in making
it both successful and distinct from the traditional federal R&D enterprise, and the
Subcommittee  added  language  to  further  specify  their  qualifications.  To  allow
ARPA–E to pursue truly novel technology areas, projects will not undergo the tradi-
tional  peer-review  process  which  has  been  criticized  as  promoting  incremental
changes  to  existing  systems.  Instead,  Program  Managers  and  their  superiors  are
given  extraordinary  autonomy  and  resources  to  quickly  pursue  unique  technology
pathways,  and  just  as  quickly  change  course  or  stop  research  if  it  does  not  look
fruitful. This is different from the current DOE model which is criticized for requir-
ing  inordinate  amounts  of  time  to  start  up  research  projects,  and  then  sustaining
support  for  projects  and  people  beyond  a  timeframe  where  meaningful  results  are
likely.

Language was added in subcommittee to further clarify that ARPA–E is expected
to  pursue  a  ‘‘whatever  it  takes’’  approach  to  moving  a  potentially  transformational
technologies from the labs to the marketplace. If adequately funded and directed the
mission-driven  ARPA–E  will  leverage  its  resources  and  institutional  capabilities  to
aggressively engage in basic research into fundamental concepts with possible tech-
nology  applications,  and  later-stage  technology  prototyping  and  large-scale  dem-
onstrations.

Despite  the  recent  attention  to  energy  challenges,  R&D  investment  in  energy  re-
mains far below the historically high levels of the 1970’s. A recent GAO report com-
missioned  by  Chairman  Gordon  and  Congressman  Honda  noted  that  ‘‘DOE’s  total
budget  authority  for  energy  R&D  dropped  by  over  85  percent  (in  real  terms)  from
1978 to 2005, peaking in the late 1970’s but falling sharply when oil prices returned
to  lower  levels  in  the  mid-1980’s.’’  (GAO–07–106)  Witnesses  at  the  April  26  Sub-
committee  hearing  all  agreed  that,  for  ARPA–E  to  be  successful,  the  program  must
be  funded  at  levels  to  match  the  magnitude  and  complexity  of  energy  challenges,
and  the  high  costs  of  energy  research  and  technology  demonstration.  According  to
venture  capitalist  John  Denniston:  ‘‘. . .federal  spending  on  renewable  energy  re-
search  amounts  to  little  more  than  $1  billion  per  year.  Frankly,  this  is  inadequate
relative to the scope of our problems, and the sheer size of the energy and transpor-
tation industries which amount to over $1.8 trillion annually. We are way off scale.’’
It  was  suggested  in  the  hearing  that  no  other  technology-based  industry  invests
such  a  small  proportion  of  revenues  in  research.  By  comparison,  Mr.  Denniston
pointed  out  that  the  National  Institute  of  Health  receives  $28  billion  for  research
annually, and DARPA itself was initially budgeted for the equivalent of $3.5 billion,
and remains at roughly the same level today.

Investment in ARPA–E should be seen in the context of increasing overall energy
R&D expenditures enough to truly address the challenge. Furthermore, it is not in-
tended  for  ARPA–E  to  come  from  other  research  accounts  within  DOE.  The  Gath-
ering  Storm  report  calls  for  ARPA–E  to  be  authorized  at  $300  million  in  the  first
year, and quickly escalate to $1 billion within five years. The Subcommittee changed
the  authorization  levels  to  reflect  concern  on  the  part  of  the  witnesses  and  other
outside  testimony  that  the  previous  authorizations  levels  were  inadequate  for  the
scale  of  the  challenge.  The  authorizations  now  ramp  up  more  quickly  to  $1  billion
in  the  second  year  to  allow  ARPA–E  to  be  fully  operational  quickly.  Hearing  wit-
nesses  and  others  have  suggested  that  the  only  way  a  high-cost,  risk-tolerant  pro-
gram like ARPA–E would survive is if it has dedicated stream of funding, and there-
fore  would  not  be  subject  to  annual  political/financial  pressures  and  resource  fluc-
tuations that stifle innovation.
III. Subcommittee Actions

H.R. 364 was introduced by Chairman Gordon on January 10, 2007, and referred
to  the  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology,  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and
Environment. This bill was first introduced as H.R. 4435 in the 109th Congress. In
the  109th  Congress  the  House  Committee  on  Science  held  a  hearing  on  March  9,
2006 examining the concept of an ARPA–E (HOUSE REPT. 109–39). Several similar
bills  calling  for  an  ARPA–E  were  introduced  in  the  109th  and  110th,  in  both  the
House and Senate (including S. 696 and S. 761, the Senate COMPETES Act).

The  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment  held  a  hearing  on  April  26,  2007

to hear testimony on H.R. 364 from the following witnesses:

• Mr. John Denniston—partner in the venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins

Caufield and Byers, and energy technology investor.

• Mr.  William  Bonvillian—Director  of  the  Washington  Office  of  the  Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology and former Senate staff on legislation estab-
lishing HS–ARPA at the Department of Homeland Security.

• Dr.  Stephen  Forrest—Vice  President  for  Research  at  the  University  of
Michigan, which recently established the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy
Institute.

• Dr.  Richard  Van  Atta—senior  researcher  at  the  Science  &  Technology  Pol-
icy  Institute  of  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analysis,  and  one  of  the  leading  ex-
perts on DARPA history.

The Subcommittee on Energy and Environment met to consider H.R. 364 on May

10, 2007 and consider the following amendments to the bill:

1. On  behalf  of  Mr.  Lampson,  Ms.  Giffords,  and  Mr.  Bartlett  which  adds  addi-
tional  goals  for  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  efficiency,  and  economic  competi-
tiveness;  clarifies  reporting  structure,  personnel  responsibilities,  activities,
and  participants;  specifies  desired  experience  of  some  personnel  and  limits
terms  to  three  years;  specifies  coordination  and  non-duplication  with  DOE
and other agencies; increases authorization levels; sets guidelines and limits
for  funding  allocations  for  demonstration  and  commercial  application,  feder-
ally  funded  R&D  Centers,  overhead  expenses,  and  new  construction.  The
amendment was agreed to by voice vote.

2. On  behalf  of  Ms.  Biggert,  Replaces  text  with  directions  to  DOE  and  NAS  to
study  ARPA–E  concept  and  make  recommendations  on  implementation.  The
amendment was defeated by voice vote.

Ms.  Giffords  moved  that  the  Subcommittee  favorably  report  the  bill  H.R.  364,  as

amended, to the Full Committee. The motion was agreed to by voice vote.
IV. Summary of Major Provisions of the Bill

H.R.  364  authorizes  $6.3  billion  for  ARPA–E  for  the  fiscal  years  2008–2013.  The
bill  also  outlines  the  organizational  structure,  hiring  practices,  goals,  and  activities
of ARPA–E. The bill specifies that, to the extent practicable, ARPA–E will not dupli-
cate  the  specific  efforts  of  other  research  programs,  will  coordinate  with  those  pro-
grams wherever possible, and seek opportunities to demonstrate technologies within
the Federal Government. Specific guidelines are set for the proportion of funds that
may be used for overhead expenses, late-stage demonstration and commercial appli-
cations,  federally  funded  research  and  development  centers,  and  new  construction.
After roughly five years of operations ARPA–E will be evaluated by the President’s
Committee on Science and Technology.
V. Section by Section Analysis of the Bill, as reported by the Subcommittee
Section 1.

Findings—The  U.S.  can  meet  long-term  energy  challenges  through  sustained  in-
vestment in energy research programs at DOE augmented by an innovative and ag-
gressive  new  energy  technology  development  effort  based  on  the  same  operating
principles that make DARPA successful.
Section 2.

Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency–Energy—Establishes  the  Advanced  Research
Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA–E) within the Department of Energy. Similar to the
Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), this new or-
ganizational  structure  will  support  revolutionary  and  transformational  energy  re-
search where risk and payoffs are high.

The  stated  goal  of  ARPA–E  is  to  develop  technologies  to  reduce  the  dependence
of the U.S. on foreign energy sources, improve energy efficiency of the U.S. economy,
reduce the impact of the energy sector on the environment, and provide for the U.S.
leadership  in  developing  energy  technologies.  To  achieve  this  ARPA–E  will  support
targeted  high-risk,  high  pay-off  research  to  accelerate  the  innovation  cycle  for  both
traditional  and  alternative  energy  sources  and  energy  efficiency.  ARPA–E  shall  be
headed  by  a  Director,  appointed  by  the  Secretary,  who  will  administer  competitive
grants,  cooperative  agreements,  or  contracts  to  universities,  industry  and  consortia
which may include federal labs.

Organization  of  ARPA–E  will  be  flat  and  nimble  to  avoid  bureaucratic  impedi-
ments  that  stifle  innovation  today.  The  Director  shall  designate  program  managers
who  will  have  flexibility  in  establishing  R&D  goals  for  the  program,  publicizing
goals,  issuing  solicitations  and  selecting  projects,  monitoring  their  progress,  and
changing or eliminating projects as needed. Projects will be chosen based on factors

195

such as novelty, scientific and technical merit, applicant’s capabilities and other cri-
teria  as  the  Director  determines.  ARPA–E  will  have  authority  to  hire  specialized
science  and  engineering  personnel  to  be  program  managers.  (This  is  similar  to
DARPA and HS–ARPA.)

In  addition,  the  Director  shall  ensure  that  ARPA–E’s  activities  do  not  duplicate
and are coordinated with other federal research programs, and shall seek opportuni-
ties  to  demonstrate  technologies  through  procurement  in  the  Federal  Government.
Section. 3.

Energy  Independence  Acceleration  Fund—Establishes  the  Energy  Independence
Acceleration  Fund  administered  by  the  Director  of  ARPA–E.  $6.3  billion  is  author-
ized for FY 2008 through 2013, to remain available until expended.
Section 4.

Recoupment—The provision allows the Secretary complete flexibility in developing
recoupment agreements, and the ability to waive it entirely if necessary for the com-
mercial  viability  of  a  project.  All  recouped  funds  will  be  returned  to  the  Energy
Independence Acceleration Fund.
Section 5.

Advisory  Committee—The  ARPA–E  Advisory  Committee  may  seek  advice  either
from  an  existing  DOE  advisory  committee  or  may  establish  a  new  advisory  com-
mittee.  If  the  Director  of  ARPA–E  requires  industry  advice,  a  panel  to  advise  on  a
specific technology area, or to hire an outside consultant, this provision provides the
appropriate authorities.
Section 6.

ARPA–E Evaluation—At the end of five and one-half years, the President’s Com-
mittee  on  Science  and  Technology  (PCAST)  shall  evaluate  how  well  ARPA–E  has
performed  in  achieving  its  goals  and  mission.  The  Committee  is  required  to  rec-
ommend  whether  ARPA–E  should  be  continued  or  terminated  as  well  as  lessons
learned from its operation.

FRIDAY,  JUNE  22,  2007

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:50  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Bart  Gordon
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman GORDON. The Committee will come to order. Pursuant
to  notice,  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  meets  to  con-
sider  the  following  measures:  H.R.  2698,  the  Federal  Aviation  Re-
search  and  Development  Reauthorization  Act  of  2007;  and  H.Res.
487, Recognizing the contribution of modeling and simulation tech-
nology to the security and prosperity of the United States and recog-
nizing  modeling  and  simulation  as  a  national  critical  technology,
and  let  me  thank  the  Members  for  coming  here  this  morning.  We
have  lots  going  on.  There  will  be  a  vote  in  about  an  hour  but  I
think  we  can  take  care  of  our  business  with  that  period.  So  again,
thank you.

We  will  now  proceed  with  the  markup.  Today  the  Committee  is

meeting to mark up two good bipartisan pieces of legislation.

The  first  bill  we  will  consider  today  is  H.R.  2698,  the  Federal
Aviation  Research  and  Development  Reauthorization  Act  of  2007,
and  H.R.  2698  was  introduced  by  Chairman  Udall.  The  Space  and
Aeronautics  Subcommittee  met  last  Thursday  to  consider  H.R.
2698  and  favorably  reported  the  bill  by  voice  vote  without  amend-
ment.  I  want  to  thank  and  congratulate  the  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee  for  their  hard  work  and  bipartisan  cooperation  on  this
bill. There are two central features of this legislation before us. The
first is a set of provisions intended to strengthen both the national
authority and the accountability of the Next Generation Air Trans-
portation  System  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office,  JPDO,
because  its  success  or  failure  is  going  to  determine  in  large  meas-
ure  whether  or  not  the  Nation  will  have  a  safe  and  efficient  air

traffic  management  system  in  the  future,  and  let  me  just  say,  this
is  a  big  deal,  bigger  than  we  are  making  it  today.  It  is  imperative
that  for  both  the  aviation  industry  as  well  as  our  nation  at  large
that  we  have  this  Next  Generation  air  traffic  control  system  and
by  and  large  it  is  going  to  be  developed  by  virtue  of  the  R&D  we
are  going  to  provide  here  in  the  FAA  bill  as  well  as  in  the  NASA
bill,  so  we  are  going  to  play  a  major  role,  and  this  is  important  to
the country.

The second feature is a four-year authorization of FAA’s research
and  development  activities  including  the  establishment  of  impor-
tant  new  research  initiatives  on  the  impact  of  space  weather  on
aviation,  the  impact  of  aviation  on  the  climate  research,  runway
materials  and  engineering  materials,  restraining  systems,  among
others. This FAA authorization expires this year. That is why it is
important  for  us  to  move  forward,  and  the  reason  it  is  important
is  that  we  have  the  option  of  going  to  the  conference  with  Trans-
portation either without a bill or with a bill, and I think by us put-
ting a mark in the sand today, it is going to make us more relevant
in  being  able  to  do  that.  Our  friend  and  colleague,  Mr.  Costello,
isn’t  here  but  I  was  hoping  he  would  come  so  we  could  give  him
a  lesson  on  legislating  so  that  he  could  get  it  out  of  his  committee
also.  I  am  sure  he  will  finally  get  here  at  which  time  we  will  give
him  some  pointers.  But  again,  this  is  important.  This  bill  will  ex-
pire  and  we  have  the  option  of  either  participating  or  not  partici-
pating,  and  I  think  we  are  doing  the  right  thing,  and  I  thank  you
for  that.  So  I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  this  very  good  bipar-
tisan bill.

Today we will also take up H.Res. 487, Recognizing the contribu-
tion of modeling and simulation technology to the security and pros-
perity  of  the  United  States  and  recognizing  modeling  and  simula-
tion  as  a  national  critical  technology,  as  well  as  the  thousands  of
Americans  who  work  to  develop  this  project.  This  is  an  under-ap-
preciated  but  fundamentally  important  area  of  research  to  our
country and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Good  morning.  Today  the  Committee  is  meeting  to  mark  up  two  good  pieces  of

legislation that have bipartisan support.

The  first  bill  that  we  will  consider  today  is  H.R.  2698,  the  Federal  Aviation  Re-

search and Development Reauthorization Act of 2007.

H.R. 2698 was introduced by Chairman Udall, and I was pleased to be an original

co-sponsor of the legislation.

The  Space  and  Aeronautics  Subcommittee  met  last  Thursday  to  consider  H.R.

2698 and favorably reported the bill by voice vote without amendment.

I  want  to  thank  and  congratulate  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  for  their  hard

work and bipartisan cooperation on this bill.

There are two central features to the legislation before us today.
The  first  is  a  set  of  provisions  intended  to  strengthen  both  the  authority  and  the
accountability  of  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System’s  Joint  Planning
and Development Office–JPDO—because its success or failure is going to determine
in large measure whether or not the Nation will have a safe and efficient air traffic
management system in the future.

The  second  feature  is  a  four-year  authorization  of  FAA’s  research  and  develop-
ment  activities,  including  the  establishment  of  important  new  research  initiatives
on  the  impact  of  space  weather  on  aviation,  the  impact  of  aviation  on  the  climate,
research on runway materials and engineered materials restraining systems, among
others.

I  believe  each  of  those  new  initiatives  will  better  position  the  FAA  to  respond  to

emerging research challenges.

As I have noted, the focus of today’s markup is FAA’s R&D program and the Next

Generation Air Transportation System initiative.

However,  it  is  clear  that  FAA  cannot  ensure  the  successful  development  of  the

Nation’s future air transportation system on its own.

As  the  establishment  of  the  interagency  JPDO  by  Congress  four  years  ago  indi-
cates,  it  is  going  to  take  the  combined  efforts  of  multiple  federal  agencies,  working
in  partnership  with  industry  and  the  academic  community,  to  make  the  NextGen
initiative a success.

NASA, in particular, has an important R&D role to play, and we will need to en-
sure  that  NASA  is  given  the  necessary  resources  to  play  that  role,  and—in  turn—
that NASA steps up to its responsibilities for conducting needed R&D.

That  is  something  that  the  Committee  will  devote  more  attention  to  as  we  start

work on reauthorizing NASA later in this Congress.

For now, however, our focus is on the FAA, and I think that H.R. 2698 is a good
bill  that  will  help  ensure  that  America’s  aviation  system  remains  safe  and  pre-
eminent in the world.

I urge my colleagues to support it.
Today,  we  will  also  take  up  H.Res.  487,  Recognizing  the  contribution  of  modeling
and  simulation  technology  to  the  security  and  prosperity  of  the  United  States,  and
recognizing modeling and simulation as a National Critical Technology.

Chairman GORDON. I now recognize Mr. Hall to present his open-

ing statement.

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  you,  Chairman  Gordon,  for  the  chance  to
make  some  opening  remarks  about  today’s  markup  on  H.R.  2698,
the  Federal  Aviation  Research  and  Development  Reauthorization
Act  of  2007,  and  H.Res.  487,  recognizing  the  contribution  of  mod-
eling  and  simulation  technology  to  the  security  and  the  prosperity
of  our  country.  These  are  two  very  important  pieces  of  legislation,
as you pointed out, that have been worked out in a bipartisan fash-
ion.  I  believe  the  FAA  legislation  will  do  a  great  deal  to  improve
research  and  development  in  aviation  and  I  am  proud  that  this
committee is advancing this legislation.

I  am  also  very  supportive  of  the  resolution  co-sponsored  by  my
good  friend,  Mr.  Feeney,  which  praises  the  good  work  of  modeling
and simulation technology.

Mr. Chairman, as always, I look forward to discussing these bills
further  we  move  through  the  markup  today,  and  I  yield  back  the
balance of my time.

Chairman  GORDON.  Without  objection,  Members  may  now  place

statements in the record at this point.

We will now consider H.Res. 487, Recognizing the contribution of
the  modeling  and  simulating  technology  to  the  security  and  pros-
perity  of  the  United  States,  and  recognizing  modeling  and  simula-
tion  as  a  national  critical  technology.  Just  for  your  information,
this  is  a  bill  that  Mr.  Forbes,  the  parliamentarian,  sent  it  to  our
committee.  We  feel  that  it  is  a  good  bill  but  we  thought  it  would
be  best  to  have  someone  on  the  Committee  that  would  bring  it
forth,  so  Mr.  Feeney  has  agreed  to  do  that,  so  we  are  glad  you
could  help  Mr.  Forbes.  I  now  yield  five  minutes  to  the  gentleman
from Florida to explain the bill.

Mr. FEENEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Does the resolution need

to be read formally before I explain it or should I weigh in?

Chairman GORDON. I think you can cut loose.
Mr. FEENEY. Okay. Great. Well, this morning’s markup of H.Res.
487  recognizes  that  modeling  and  simulation  technology  is  a  na-
tional  critical  technology  essential  for  American’s  long-term  na-

tional  security  and  economic  prosperity.  Congressman  Randy
Forbes,  as  Chairman  Gordon  mentioned,  a  former  Member  of  this
committee  and  current  Chairman  of  the  Modeling  and  Simulation
Caucus,  introduced  this  legislation.  I,  as  a  member  of  that  caucus
and  representing  one  of  the  larger  modeling  and  simulation  clus-
ters  in  the  United  States,  am  honored  to  urge  this  committee  to
pass this legislation.

Your child’s or grandchild’s video game represents one product of
the modeling and simulation industry. Aircraft training simulators
provide  another  well-known  example.  I  don’t  know  if  Ranking
Member Ralph Hall used the link trainer as he prepared for World
War II service but that rather rudimentary flight simulator helped
train a generation of military pilots and laid the foundation for this
important technology. Simulation uses combinations of sound, sight
and  motion  to  make  you  feel  that  you  are  experiencing  an  actual
event. Modeling involves the complex computer models used to cre-
ate  these  artificial  environments.  For  training  purposes,  modeling
and simulation places people in an artificial but seemingly real en-
vironment  and  puts  them  through  their  paces.  But  unlike  live
training,  if  you  make  a  mistake,  you  get  to  live  another  day  and
learn  valuable  lessons.  An  inestimable  number  of  lives  have  been
saved  that  otherwise  might  have  been  lost  in  training  accidents
while  improving  the  overall  quality  of  training.  In  the  latter  part
of the 20th century, the U.S. military revolutionalized war fighting
by emphasizing high-fidelity training that simulates the stress and
decision-making of actual combat. Servicemen and women gain ex-
perience and judgment previously only earned on the actual battle-
field.  Substantial  amounts  of  that  simulation  and  training  come
from my Congressional district where representatives of all service
branches  collaborate.  By  the  way,  it  is  the  oldest  joint  military  fa-
cility in the country with the University of Central Florida and pri-
vate contractors of all sizes producing these training systems.

Other  clusters  of  modeling  and  simulation  excellence  exist
throughout the United States but such training expands far beyond
military  uses.  Medical  simulation  is  an  especially  promising  field.
By creating artificial but seemingly real environments, doctors and
nurses  can  hone  their  skills  in  using  sophisticated  and  invasive
medical technology or in treating severely injured patients.

Beyond training, modeling and simulation replicates complex en-
vironments,  allowing  planners  and  designers  to  ask  various  ‘‘what
if’’  questions.  Transportation  planners  simulate  highway  networks
to  determine  how  to  best  alleviate  congestion.  The  Illinois  State
Toll  Highway  Authority  uses  simulation  to  determine  how  to  im-
prove  highway  signage  and  reduce  crashes  near  toll  plazas.  Emer-
gency  management  experts  simulate  large-scale  natural  or  man-
made disasters to better improve coordinated emergency responses.
Hurricane  Katrina  highlighted  the  need  to  better  utilize  modeling
and  simulation  in  order  to  protect  life  and  property.  Because  of
these growing numbers of uses, the modeling and simulation indus-
try  is  a  rapidly  growing  industry  that  demands  the  best  students
with extensive math and science backgrounds including psychology,
medicine, computer science, mathematics, engineering and physics.
In  these  brief  remarks,  I  have  used  examples  of  modeling  and
simulation technology to illustrate its value in our complex and dy-

that  recognizes  the  national  critical  technology  and  urges  govern-
ment  action  in  the  areas  of  industry  classification  codes  and  intel-
lectual property to strengthen America’s lead in this technology.

I  want  to  thank  the  Chairman  and  the  Ranking  Member  and

would yield back the balance of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE TOM FEENEY

This  morning’s  markup  of  H.Res.  487  recognizes  that  modeling  and  simulation
technology  is  a  National  Critical  Technology  essential  for  America’s  long-term  na-
tional security and economic prosperity.

Congressman  Randy  Forbes—a  former  Member  of  this  committee  and  current

as a member of that caucus and representing one of the larger modeling and simula-

ters  to  better  improve  coordinated  emergency  responses.  Hurricane  Katrina  high-
lighted  the  need  to  better  utilize  modeling  and  simulation  in  order  to  protect  life
and property.

Because  of  these  growing  number  of  uses,  the  modeling  and  simulation  industry
is  rapidly  growing  and  demands  the  best  of  students  with  extensive  math  and
science backgrounds including psychology, medicine, computer science, mathematics,
engineering and physics.

In these brief remarks, I’ve used examples of modeling and simulation technology
to  illustrate  its  value  in  our  complex  and  dynamic  world.  So  I  urge  you  to  support
this  resolution  that  recognizes  this  National  Critical  Technology  and  urges  govern-
mental  action  in  the  areas  of  industry  classification  codes  and  intellectual  property
to strengthen America’s lead in this technology.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Feeney, for that good expla-

nation.

Mr. Hall, did you have anything you would like to add?
Mr. HALL. I think it is very good legislation and I appreciate the

gentleman’s time and your cooperation. I yield back.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  spent  most  of  my  professional
career  in  modeling  and  simulation  and  I  can  tell  you  that  it  is  a
great activity. It is exciting and it allows scientists to reach in and
see what is going on in very remote processes. It allows developers
to  understand  what  is  going  on  with  their  products.  It  allows  in-
dustry  a  lot  of  leeway  in  terms  of  expenditures.  It  is  a  great  tool
and the Americans are in the lead in this tool. We need to acknowl-
edge  that  lead.  We  need  to  nurture  and  stimulate,  shall  I  say,
growth  of  that  industry  in  our  country.  It  also  allows  our  military
to understand the impacts of their weapons and it is a terrific tool
that will allow us to maintain our lead in the world in many, many
fields. So I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. McNerney.
Any  other  comments?  If  not,  let  me  just—in  conclusion,  let  me
say  I  think  this  really  is  a  good  example  of  what  I  hope  this  com-
mittee will be known for, and that is a committee of good ideas and
consensus. This bill didn’t originate from any Member of this com-
mittee and so let the word go out if we have colleagues, Democrats,
Republicans  that  have  good  ideas  and  the  jurisdiction  is  here  that
we  want  them  to  bring  them  forth  and  they  will  be  treated  fairly.
So  now  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  resolution  is  consid-
ered as read and open at any point and that the Members proceed
with  amendments  in  the  order  of  the  roster.  Without  objection,  so
ordered.

I  assume  there  are  no  amendments.  Without  any  amendments
then,  the  vote  is  on  H.  Resolution  487.  All  those  in  favor  say  aye.
Opposed,  no.  The  ayes  have  it.  I  recognize  Mr.  Hall  to  offer  a  mo-
tion.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Committee  favorably
report  House  Resolution  487  to  the  House  with  the  recommenda-
tion that the bill do pass. Furthermore, I move that the staff be in-
structed  to  make  necessary  technical  and  conforming  changes  and
that  the  Chairman  take  all  necessary  steps  to  bring  the  resolution
before the House for consideration, and I yield back my time.

Chairman  GORDON.  The  question  is  on  the  motion  to  report  the
resolution  favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by
saying aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it and the resolution is fa-
vorably reported.

Without objection the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I  move  pursuant  to  clause  1  of  Rule  22  of  the  Rules  of  the  House
of  Representatives  that  the  Committee  authorize  the  Chairman  to
offer such motions as may be necessary in the House to adopt and
pass H.Res. 487, Recognizing the contribution of modeling and sim-
ulation  technology  to  the  security  and  prosperity  of  the  United

II. PURPOSE OF THE BILL

The  purpose  of  the  H.R.  2850  is  to  provide  for  the  implementa-

tion of a Green Chemistry Research and Development Program.

III. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR THE LEGISLATION

Chemical  manufacturing,  although  a  necessary  part  of  our  econ-
omy, can result in harm to human health and the environment due
to  the  usage  of  hazardous  materials  and  the  generation  of  haz-
ardous byproducts. Green chemistry seeks to mitigate such harmful
outcomes.  In  short,  the  goal  of  green  chemistry  is  to  minimize  or,
ideally, to eliminate this harm by using safer materials and manu-
facturing processes.

By  considering  chemical  hazards  in  the  design  of  products  and
processes,  chemists  can  design  chemicals  to  be  safe,  just  as  they
can  design  them  to  have  other  properties.  One  example  of  green
chemistry  was  the  development  of  pesticide  alternatives  that  are
effective  at  killing  target  organisms,  but  are  benign  to  non-target
organisms and do not persist in the environment. Another example
of successful green chemistry is the use of a benign solvent, super-
critical  carbon  dioxide,  in  dry  cleaning  processes  instead  of  toxic
perchloroethylene (PERC).

Besides  protecting  human  health  and  the  environment,  green
chemistry  can  offer  economic  advantages  and  improvements  to
worker  safety,  public  safety,  and  national  security.  However,  sig-
nificant  impediments  exist  that  discourage  businesses  from  pur-
suing such alternatives, such as a workforce unfamiliar with green
chemistry,  lack  of  existing  green  chemistry  alternatives,  lack  of
demonstrated green chemistry alternatives, costs of up-front capital
investment, lack of regulatory drivers, and inertia.

CURRENT PRIVATE SECTOR EFFORTS IN GREEN CHEMISTRY

A  number  of  companies  have  undertaken  green  chemistry
projects  on  their  own.  The  Federal  Government  has  highlighted
some of these efforts through programs such as EPA’s Presidential
Green Chemistry Challenge Awards Program. A number of compa-
nies  are  also  acting  to  increase  their  usage  of  more  environ-
mentally  friendly  ingredients  to  avoid  costs  associated  with  han-
dling  or  treating  more  hazardous  substances  and  in  response  to
consumer  demand  for  more  environmentally  friendly  products.  For

example  in  2001,  U.S.-based  global  consumer  products  manufac-
turer  and  marketer  S.C.  Johnson  &  Son,  Inc.  developed  a  process
called  Greenlist  to  formalize  the  classification  of  raw  materials
used in its products according to the impact they have on the envi-
ronment  and  human  health.  Greenlist  provides  ratings  for  more
than  95  percent  of  raw  materials  used  by  the  company,  including
surfactants, solvents, propellants, insecticides, and packaging.

Through  the  Greenlist  process,  each  raw  material  ingredient  re-
ceives a rating from 3 to 0. An ingredient with a 3 rating is consid-
ered  ‘‘Best,’’  2  is  ‘‘Better,’’  and  1  is  ‘‘Acceptable.’’  0-rated  materials
may  be  used  only  when  an  acceptable  alternative  is  not  available
and  requires  approval  by  senior  management.  When  S.C.  Johnson
scientists  create  a  new  product  or  reformulate  existing  products,
they  work  to  select  raw  materials  rated  ‘‘Better’’  or  ‘‘Best.’’  Thus,
Greenlist  is  a  continual  improvement  process  that  increases  the
company’s  use  of  environmentally  preferred  raw  materials  in  its
products.

CURRENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GREEN CHEMISTRY RELATED

ACTIVITIES

The  Federal  Government  supports  activities  related  to  green
chemistry through agencies including the National Science Founda-
tion  (NSF),  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  the  De-
partment of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). Some agencies, such as EPA, run programs
that  are  focused  directly  on  green  chemistry.  Other  agencies,  such
as  DOE,  fund  green  chemistry  as  byproducts  of  efforts  to  achieve
other  goals,  such  as  improving  energy  efficiency.  Because  some
green chemistry investments are direct and some are indirect, and
because  green  chemistry  is  not  broken  out  in  agency  budgets,  it  is
difficult  to  determine  the  precise  level  of  federal  investment  in
green chemistry.

It  is  clear,  however,  that  the  investment  in  green  chemistry  and
chemical engineering is small compared to the investment in chem-
istry and chemical engineering as a whole. In 2000, the four agen-
cies  mentioned  above  spent  approximately  $540  million  on  chem-
istry  and  chemical  engineering  research  and  development  (R&D);
investment in green chemistry R&D was probably close to $40 mil-
lion.  In  addition,  green  chemistry  activities  are  not  fully  coordi-
nated among the federal agencies.

EPA supports both green chemistry R&D and outreach efforts to
promote green chemistry. The R&D is funded through the Office of
Research  and  Development;  the  outreach  and  promotion  through
the  Office  of  Pollution  Prevention  and  Toxic  Substances  (OPPTS).
In  fiscal  year  2004  (FY04),  EPA  spent  approximately  $5  million
directly on green chemistry and chemical engineering R&D and ap-
proximately  $2  million  on  other  green  chemistry  activities.  The
R&D funding was split between internal R&D, conducted at EPA’s
lab in Cincinnati and external R&D through the Science to Achieve
Results  (STAR)  program.  As  part  of  the  STAR  program,  EPA  and
NSF  developed  a  partnership,  the  Technologies  for  a  Sustainable
Environment  (TSE)  program,  which  primarily  funded  green  chem-
istry and chemical engineering R&D. The other $2 million in fund-
ing  for  green  chemistry  activities  supported  green  chemistry  out-

253

reach  programs  such  as  the  Presidential  Green  Chemistry  Chal-
lenge Award Program.

The  TSE  program  was  the  external  R&D  program  most  focused
on green chemistry in the Federal Government. EPA and NSF put
out  a  joint  request  for  proposals,  and  then  each  agency  awarded
grants  based  on  its  own  mission.  NSF  funded  more  basic  green
chemistry  R&D,  while  EPA  funded  more  applied  R&D.  TSE  was
initiated in 1995, and the last TSE solicitation was issued in 2003.
Through 2003, EPA and NSF awarded over $57 million for 205 re-
search projects under the TSE program.

However,  the  Administration  has  eliminated  EPA  funding  for
TSE.  The  result  has  been  a  large  decrease  in  the  amount  of  fund-
ing EPA spends on green chemistry activities. Because EPA discon-
tinued funding for the TSE program, NSF has also virtually elimi-
nated  specific  funding  for  the  TSE  program  which  was  NSF’s  only
explicit  green  chemistry  funding  opportunity.  While  NSF  does  not
put  out  specific  solicitations  for  green  chemistry  R&D,  NSF  funds
a wide range of research in green chemistry R&D.

DOE  does  not  track  spending  on  green  chemistry  activities,  and
does  not  conduct  activities  that  it  specifically  identifies  as  green
chemistry.  However,  DOE  conducts  R&D  that  has  many  green
chemistry  applications.  DOE’s  fundamental  research  efforts  in
chemistry  are  focused  on  attaining  an  atomic  and  molecular  level
understanding of processes involved in the generation, storage, and
use of energy.

NIST  has  no  programs  specifically  focused  on  green  chemistry
but  conducts  R&D  with  implications  for,  and  application  to,  green
chemistry. For example, the Chemical Science and Technology Lab-
oratory  produces  more  accurate  measurement  methods  and  stand-
ards  to  enable  the  development  and  implementation  of  green  tech-
nologies and assess their impact.

H.R. 2850

H.R. 2850 is designed to focus and integrate the Federal Govern-
ment’s green chemistry R&D activities, and to make them a higher
priority.  The  legislation  is  also  designed  to  increase  education  and
training in green chemistry.

One impediment to the application of green chemistry is the lack
of  a  chemistry  workforce  that  is  skilled  in  green  chemistry  tech-
niques. H.R. 2850 would support undergraduate and graduate edu-
cation  in  green  chemistry.  This  should  help  create  a  new  genera-
tion  of  chemists  and  chemical  engineers  who  are  familiar  with
green  chemistry  and  its  advantages,  and  can  bring  those  skills  to
bear in the workplace. The Act would also support continuing edu-
cation for professional chemists and chemical engineers so that the
large  existing  workforce  can  be  trained  in  green  chemistry  tech-
niques.

The  coordinated  R&D  program  would  also  support  R&D  and
demonstration  projects  at  universities,  industry  and  federal  labs.
This  includes  industry-university  partnerships  to  facilitate  the
transfer of new ideas to industry. In addition, H.R. 2850 makes in-
formation  about  green  chemistry  activities  readily  available
through  a  green  chemistry  database  of  accomplishments  and  best
practices.  This  should  aid  interested  companies  in  learning  about,

overcoming  barriers  to,  and  implementing  green  chemistry  alter-

IV. COMMITTEE ACTIONS

110th CONGRESS
On  June  10,  2007,  Mr.  Gingrey  introduced  H.R.  2850,  the  Green
Chemistry  Research  and  Development  Act  of  2007,  along  with  Mr.
Mario Diaz-Balart, Mr. Wu, Mr. Ehlers, and Mr. Welch. H.R. 2850,
as  introduced,  was  substantially  the  same  as  the  bills  introduced
and passed by the Committee in the previous two Congresses: H.R.
1215 (Report 109–82) in the 109th Congress and H.R. 3970 (Report
108–462)  in  the  108th  Congress.  The  major  change  to  the  legisla-
tion is an increase in funding levels for the agencies responsible for
carrying out the legislation.

On July 11, 2007, the Committee on Science and Technology met
to  consider  H.R.  2850.  The  Committee  considered  the  following
amendments to the bill:

1. Mr. Lipinski offered an amendment to expand the activities
in  the  Manufacturing  Extension  Program  with  the  aim  of
reducing  the  use  or  generation  of  hazardous  substances  to
include  recycling.  The  amendment  was  agreed  to  by  voice
vote.

2. Ms. Johnson offered an amendment to ensure that Minority
Serving  Institutions  receive  consideration  for  funds  avail-
able  under  the  act  for  green  chemistry  instruction.  The
amendment was agreed to by voice vote.

The  legislation  was  agreed  to  by  a  voice  vote.  Mr.  Hall  moved
that the Committee favorably report the bill, H.R. 2850, as amend-
ed, to the House with the recommendation that the bill, as amend-
ed, do pass, and that the staff be instructed to make technical and
conforming changes to the bill, as amended, and prepare the legis-
lative  report,  and  that  the  Chairman  take  all  necessary  steps  to
bring  the  bill  before  the  House  for  consideration.  The  motion  was
agreed to by a voice vote.

V. SUMMARY OF MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BILL, AS REPORTED

VI. SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 1: Short Title

‘‘Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2007’’

Section 2: Definitions

Defines  terms  used  in  the  text  including  green  chemistry,  interagency  working

group, and program.
Section 3: Green Chemistry Research and Development Program

This section directs the President to establish an interagency research and devel-
opment (R&D) program to promote and coordinate federal green chemistry research,
development,  demonstration,  education,  and  technology  transfer  activities.  The  pro-
gram  will  provide  sustained  support  for  green  chemistry  R&D  through  merit-re-
viewed  competitive  grants,  R&D  partnerships  of  universities,  industry,  and  non-
profit organizations, and through R&D conducted at federal laboratories.

agency  coordination,  including  budget  coordination.  Requires  the  group  to  submit  a
report to the Committee on Science and Technology of the House of Representatives
and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate within
two  years  of  the  enactment  of  this  legislation  that  includes  a  summary  of  the
progress made towards the goals and priorities established for the program, includ-
ing recommendations for future program activities.
Section 4: Manufacturing Extension Center Green Suppliers Network Grant

Program

Amends  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  Act  to  make  eligible
as  a  Manufacturing  Extension  Program  activity  with  the  enabling  of  supply  chain
manufactures  to  conduct  activities  with  the  aim  of  reducing  or  eliminating  the  use
or generation of hazardous substances.
Section 5: Undergraduate Education in Chemistry and Chemical Engineer-

ing

This  section  enables  the  Director  of  the  National  Science  Foundation  to  award

Authorizes  appropriations  for  green  chemistry  R&D  programs  from  sums  already
authorized to be appropriated, for the National Science Foundation, the National In-
stitute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  the  Department  of  Energy,  and  the  Environ-
mental Protection Agency.

VII. COMMITTEE VIEW

The  Committee  expects  NSF,  EPA,  DOE  and  NIST  to  give  more
focused  attention  to  green  chemistry.  That  means  running  pro-
grams  that  are  specifically  targeted  at  funding  green  chemistry
R&D,  education,  and  technology  transfer,  not  just  funding  such
work as an afterthought or as a byproduct of other efforts, or if pro-
posals  related  to  green  chemistry  happen  to  be  submitted  by  re-
searchers.  The  Committee  is  disappointed  that  the  Administration
terminated  the  EPA–NSF  Technologies  for  a  Sustainable  Environ-
ment  (TSE)  program  in  2004.  This  was  the  only  explicit  green
chemistry R&D program. The program should be reconstituted.

The Committee also expects the agencies to do a better job of co-
ordinating their efforts in green chemistry so that the Federal Gov-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:28 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729A.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

257

ernment  has  a  comprehensive  effort  in  green  chemistry  that  can
meet  industry’s  needs  while  drawing  on  the  unique  strengths  and
expertise of each agency.

The  Committee  expects  the  Interagency  Working  Group  to  track
Federal  expenditures  on  green  chemistry.  The  legislation  requires
agencies  and  OMB  to  explicitly  state  the  portion  of  their  request
that  will  contribute  to  the  activities  authorized  by  this  legislation.
The  Committee  expects  this  report  to  reflect  an  effort  to  think
through  what  is  specifically  needed  for  green  chemistry;  it  should
not  be  a  mere  cobbling  together  of  disparate  budgets  submitted  by
each agency.

The  Committee  expects  that,  as  part  of  its  coordination  efforts,
the  Interagency  Working  Group  will  identify  areas  in  which  green
chemistry could help achieve federal, as well as industry needs. Ob-
vious  areas  include  improving  homeland  security  and  the  develop-
ment  of  non-toxic  chemicals  to  combat  invasive  species.  Clear  in-
dustry needs include the development of benign solvents or solvent-
less processes for a range of chemical processes, and new materials
for  buildings,  such  as  paints  and  carpets  that  have  lower  toxicity.
One  way  green  chemistry  R&D  programs  can  help  assure  both
relevance to, and adoption by, industry is to fund university-indus-
try partnerships, which may also include national laboratories and
other  non-profit  institutions.  Not  all  green  chemistry  R&D  should
be funded this way, but it should be an emphasis in the R&D pro-
grams. The Committee intends that all R&D grants awarded under
this legislation be competitively awarded and merit reviewed.

Beyond  operating  more  specific  programs  to  fund  green  chem-
istry  activities,  the  federal  agencies  should  integrate  green  chem-
istry techniques in all of their chemistry and chemical engineering
R&D  activities.  The  Committee  believes  that,  when  soliciting  and
evaluating all chemistry and chemical engineering R&D grant pro-
posals,  the  agencies  should  consider  whether  the  application  ad-
dresses  the  toxicity  of  the  proposed  chemical  process  and  product.
The Committee considers education and outreach activities as es-
sential  parts  of  a  comprehensive  green  chemistry  effort.  For  this
reason,  the  legislation  authorizes  two  specific  education  pro-
grams—one  to  update  undergraduate  chemistry  curricula  to  incor-
porate green chemistry concepts and strategies and a second to au-
thorize  grants  for  universities  that  partner  with  chemical  compa-
nies to retrain professional chemists and chemical engineers in the
use  of  green  chemistry  concepts  and  strategies.  The  Interagency
Working  Group  should  make  sure  that  participating  agencies  are
engaging  in  these  activities,  consistent  with  their  overall  missions.
Outreach activities should include the creation of an easily acces-
sible  one-stop-shop  for  green  chemistry  information.  Specifically,
the  Interagency  Working  Group  may  want  to  consider  whether  it
would  be  useful  to  maintain  a  list  of  chemical  products  and  proc-
esses that are benign so that a company looking for a green chem-
istry  solution  could  have  easy  access  to  available  green  chemistry
alternatives.

The Committee believes that there are many barriers to the suc-
cessful  commercialization  of  green  chemistry.  For  this  reason,  the
Committee  believes  that  the  Interagency  Working  Group  should
fund research to determine economic, legal and other barriers. This

258

is also why the Committee authorizes a National Research Council
study  into  the  barriers  to  successful  commercialization  of  green
chemistry.

In  carrying  out  its  responsibilities,  the  Interagency  Working
Group  should  consult  regularly  with  a  wide  range  of  researchers
and  end-users,  especially  private  companies.  The  Committee  also
expects  the  Interagency  Working  Group  to  be  able  to  provide  Con-
gress  with  a  clear  explanation  of  the  goals  and  priorities  of  the
green  chemistry  program,  how  each  agency’s  activities  are  contrib-
uting  to  those  goals,  and  how  achievement  of  those  goals  is  being
evaluated. An important metric for the program should be whether
new  green  chemistry  products  and  processes  are  being  developed
and whether they are being adopted by industry.

VIII. COST ESTIMATE

A  cost  estimate  and  comparison  prepared  by  the  Director  of  the
Congressional Budget Office under section 402 of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974 has been timely submitted to the Committee on
Science  and  Technology  prior  to  the  filing  of  this  report  and  is  in-
cluded  in  Section  X  of  this  report  pursuant  to  House  Rule  XIII,
clause 3(c)(3).

H.R.  2850  does  not  contain  new  budget  authority,  credit  author-
ity, or changes in revenues or tax expenditures. Assuming that the
sums  authorized  under  the  bill  are  appropriated,  H.R.  2850  does
authorize  additional  discretionary  spending,  as  described  in  the
Congressional  Budget  Office  report  on  the  bill,  which  is  contained
in Section X of this report.

IX. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

SUMMARY

H.R.  2850  would  authorize  appropriations  to  promote  the  devel-
opment  of  green  chemistry  technologies.  Green  chemistry  encour-
ages the design of products and processes that reduce or eliminate
the use or generation of hazardous substances. Activities under the
bill  would  include  the  establishment  of  a  Green  Chemistry  Re-
search and Development Program and the creation of collaborative,
multi-agency  grant  programs.  Assuming  appropriation  of  the  au-
thorized and necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing
H.R. 2850 would cost $18 million in 2008 and $181 million over the
2008–2012  period.  Enacting  H.R.  2850  would  not  affect  direct
spending or revenues.

H.R.  2850  contains  no  intergovernmental  or  private-sector  man-
dates  as  defined  in  the  Unfunded  Mandates  Reform  Act  (UMRA)
and would benefit State and local governments.
ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

The estimated budgetary impact of H.R. 2850 is shown in the fol-
lowing  table.  The  costs  of  this  legislation  fall  within  budget  func-
tions 250 (science, space, and technology) and 800 (general govern-
ment).

BASIS OF ESTIMATE

For  this  estimate,  CBO  assumes  that  H.R.  2850  will  be  enacted
near  the  end  of  fiscal  year  2007  and  that  the  entire  amounts  au-
thorized  and  estimated  to  be  necessary  will  be  appropriated  for
each fiscal year. Estimated outlays are based on historical spending
patterns for similar programs.
Green Chemistry Research and Grant Programs

H.R.  2850  would  authorize  the  appropriation  of  $58  million  in
2008  and  about  $188  million  over  the  2008–2010  period  to  create
multi-agency  grant  programs  for  the  study  of  green  chemistry.
(Green  chemistry  encourages  the  design  of  products  and  processes
that  reduce  or  eliminate  the  use  or  generation  of  hazardous  sub-
stances.)  Under  the  bill,  grants  would  be  awarded  to  investigators
for general research and development, and to universities for estab-
lishing partnerships with the chemical industry to retrain chemists
and  engineers  in  the  field  of  green  chemistry.  The  bill  would  au-
thorize  several  agency  appropriations  for  those  grant  and  research
activities.

For  NSF,  H.R.  2850  would  authorize  the  appropriation  of  be-
tween  $27  million  and  $30  million  a  year  over  the  2008–2010  pe-
riod. NSF also would be required to conduct a study on the barriers
to commercial application of green chemistry technologies.

For the other specified agencies, the following amounts would be
authorized  to  be  appropriated  over  the  2008–2010  period:  $27  mil-

lion  for  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  $42
million for the Department of Energy, and $33 million for the Envi-
ronmental  Protection  Agency  to  carry  out  the  coordinated  grant
programs.  Assuming  appropriation  of  the  authorized  amounts  for
all  agencies,  CBO  estimates  that  implementing  those  provisions
would result in discretionary spending of $18 million in fiscal year
2008 and $181 million over the 2008–2012 period.
Interagency Working Group

H.R.  2850  would  establish  a  Green  Chemistry  Research  and  De-
velopment  Program  within  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President
and  create  an  interagency  working  group  to  promote  and  coordi-
nate  federal  green  chemistry  research  and  development.  Agencies
participating in the program would report annually on their activi-
ties,  and  the  interagency  working  group  would  report  within  two
years  to  the  Congress  on  the  status  of  green  chemistry  research.
Based  on  information  from  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget
and  the  cost  of  similar  programs,  CBO  estimates  that  imple-
menting those provisions would cost $1 million over the 2008–2010
period.
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE–SECTOR IMPACT

H.R.  2850  contains  no  intergovernmental  or  private-sector  man-
dates  as  defined  in  UMRA  and  would  create  several  grant  pro-
grams  benefiting  institutions  of  higher  education.  Any  costs  State,
local, or tribal governments might incur, including matching funds,
would be incurred voluntarily.

XX:  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE  FULL  COMMITTEE
MARKUP  ON  H.R.  2850,  THE  GREEN  CHEM-
ISTRY  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  ACT
OF  2007

WEDNESDAY,  JULY  11,  2007

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  10:17  a.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Bart  Gordon
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.

Chairman GORDON. The Committee will come to order. Pursuant
to  notice,  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  meets  to  con-
sider  the  following  measures:  H.R.  2850,  the  Green  Chemistry  Re-
search  and  Development  Act  of  2007;  and  H.R.  2337,  the  Energy
Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007.

And  I  would  like  to  briefly  talk  about  H.R.  2337.  H.R.  2337  was
referred to the Committee on Natural Resources, the Committee on
Agriculture,  and  also,  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology.
The  Natural  Resources  Committee  held  hearings  on  the  bill  in
May,  and  marked  up  the  bill  last  month.  The  Agriculture  Com-
mittee has not yet acted on the bill.

The  Committee  staff,  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  have  been  in  discus-
sions  over  the  last  week  or  so  with  the  Natural  Resources  Com-
mittee  about  provisions  in  H.R.  2337  where  there  are  policy  dif-
ferences  within  the  Science  and  Technology  jurisdiction.  Following
consideration  of  H.R.  2850,  I  plan  to  recess  the  Committee,  and
postpone  consideration  of  H.R.  2337  until  Thursday  or  Friday,  so
that our staff may continue with these bipartisan, good faith nego-
tiations.

And  let  me  say  that  I  think  we  all,  Democrats  and  Republicans,
are  concerned  about  maintaining  the,  certainly  the  prerogative  of
this committee, jurisdiction of this committee, and we also want to
get a good product. I think we can do this without being a jerk. The
fact  of  the  matter  is,  as  we  go  through  the  energy  bills,  there  is
going  to  be  a  lot  of  joint  jurisdiction,  sometimes  two,  sometimes
three  committees  at  once.  Jim  Matheson  and  I,  on  another  com-
mittee, that we are working on some joint things, and so, my hope
is,  again,  that  we  can  work  these  things  out  without  getting  into
a  lot  of  problems  between  committees.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is
Democrats and Republicans on this committee are going to work to-
gether  for  a  while,  our  brothers  and  sisters  on  Resources,  Energy
and  Commerce,  and  Agriculture,  we  are  going  to  be  working  to-
gether  for  a  while.  I  think  we  want  to  deal  with  everybody  honor-
ably, and that is the way we are going to try to proceed.

We  now  proceed  with  the  markup.  The  bill  we  consider  today  is
H.R.  2850,  the  Green  Chemistry  Research  and  Development  Act  of
2007. When I became Chairman of this committee, I made a prom-
ise that this would be a committee of good ideas and consensus. We

are  here  to  solve  the  problems,  and  solutions  are  welcome  from
both sides of the aisle. Today, the Committee is meeting to consider
legislation  introduced  by  Congressman  Gingrey  that  addresses  an
issue that he has particular expertise with, and that is green chem-
istry.  With  an  undergraduate  degree  in  chemistry,  followed  by  a
medical degree, Dr. Gingrey has long been an advocate for increas-
ing government research into the green chemistry.

Chemical  manufacturing  can  result  in  harm  to  human  health
and  the  environment,  due  to  the  use  of  hazardous  materials  and
the  generation  of  hazardous  byproducts.  Green  chemistry  seeks  to
mitigate  such  harmful  outcomes.  In  short,  the  goal  of  green  chem-
istry is to minimize or to eliminate this harm, by using safer mate-
rials  and  manufacturing  processes.  Besides  protecting  human
health  and  the  environment,  green  chemistry  can  offer  economic
advantages,  improvements  to  work  safety,  public  safety,  and  our
national security.

H.R.  2850  establishes  an  interagency  program  to  enhance  green
chemistry  R&D  at  the  National  Science  Foundation,  EPA,  DOE,
and  NIST.  This  legislation  will  provide  grants  to  individual  re-
searchers,  spur  university-industry  partnerships,  fund  research  at
federal laboratories, and train students in green chemistry science.
H.R.  2850  is  the  third  iteration  of  a  bill  that  Congressman
Gingrey  has  introduced  addressing  this  issue.  Democratic  amend-
ments  were  agreed  to,  and  now  make  up  sections  of  H.R.  2850.
This bill is a product of good bipartisan cooperation.

However,  there  has,  and  there  remains,  apprehension  among
some  Democratic  Members  that  this  Act  simply  does  not  go  far
enough  to  promote  the  adoption  of  green  chemistry,  but  H.R.  2850
is  a  good  first  step,  and  I  urge  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee  to
support this legislation, and I am sure Dr. Gingrey will be glad for
us all to take credit for it at home when we get this passed.

I  want  to  thank  all  the  Members  for  their  cooperation  and  par-
ticipation during this first half of the year. I look forward to work-
ing with all of you as we move into August.

And  let  me  particularly  say  thank  you  to  the  staff,  both  Demo-
crats and the Majority. I know we have asked you to do a lot. You
have  done  a  lot.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  we  are  going  to  be
a  major  participant  in  the  Energy  Bill  that  is  going  to  come  down
here  very  soon.  We  could  have  decided  no,  we  are  not  going  to  do
it,  but  we  didn’t.  We  decided  we  were  going  to  work  hard,  get
things  done,  and  I  think  it  is  going  to  be  pay  off,  because  we  are
going  to  have  a  lot  of  provisions  in  this  bill.  We  are  also  going  to
be  major  players  in  the  conference,  and  so,  there  will  be  many  of
us on that conference, so we can have more input.

Also, I went over to the Senate yesterday to talk with Lamar Al-
exander.  The  conference,  well,  not  the  conference,  but  the  pre-con-
ference is coming along on our Competitiveness Agenda. He is very
anxious  to  move  this  forward.  He  is  doing  really  a  very  good  job
over  in  the  Senate.  Chuck  Atkins,  who  I  don’t  think  is  here  now,
but has been a great taskmaster, in setting forth an agenda for all
of  these,  and  we  have  no  telling  how  many  committees  of  jurisdic-
tion in the Senate, that are all working together, again, on a bipar-
tisan, bicameral basis.

I think we are going to be able to get this thing done by the end
of this session. If we can get it done and passed—and I remind you
that  it  passed  unanimously  out  of  this  committee,  we  only  had  21
negative  votes  on  the  House  Floor—I  think  this  Competitiveness
Agenda  will  be  the  major  legislative  accomplishment  of  this  first
six  months,  and  again,  we  will  all  be  a  part  of  that,  and  I  thank
you all for working and helping us.

Let  me  also  say  that  for  those  of  you  that  are  going  on  the
CODEL to Greenland this following weekend, Jerry McNerney just
made  me  aware  that  you  need  to  get  your  hepatitis  and  typhoid
shots.  If  they  are  not  up  to  speed,  you  can  check  with  the  doctor’s
office. They will know. I don’t think Greenland is a very hazardous
area,  but  there  are  those  shots  that  we  need  to  take,  and  we  will
get ready for that.

So I now recognize Mr. Hall, to present his opening remarks.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Good  Morning.  The  Committee  will  come  to  order.  Pursuant  to  notice,  the  Com-

mittee on Science and Technology meets to consider the following measures:

• H.R. 2850, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2007.
• H.R. 2337, the Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act of 2007.

I  would  like  to  briefly  talk  about  H.R.  2337.  This  bill  was  referred  to  the  Com-
mittee  on  Natural  Resources,  the  Committee  on  Agriculture,  and  also  to  the  Com-
mittee on Science and Technology. The Natural Resources Committee held hearings
on  the  bill  in  May  and  marked  up  the  bill  last  month.  The  Agriculture  Committee
has not yet acted on the bill.

Committee staff has been in discussions over the last week or so with the Natural
Resources  Committee  about  provisions  in  H.R.  2337  where  there  are  policy  dif-
ferences  within  the  Science  and  Technology  jurisdiction.  Following  consideration  of
H.R. 2850, I plan to recess the Committee and postpone consideration of H.R. 2337
until Thursday or Friday so that we may continue negotiations.

We  will  now  proceed  with  the  markup.  The  bill  we  will  consider  today  is  H.R.

2850, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2007.

When  I  took  the  reigns  of  this  committee,  I  made  a  promise  that  this  would  be
a  committee  of  ‘‘Good  Ideas’’  and  ‘‘Consensus.’’  We  are  here  to  solve  problems,  and
solutions are welcome from both sides of the aisle.

Today,  the  Committee  is  meeting  to  consider  legislation  introduced  by  Congress-
man  Gingrey  that  addresses  an  issue  that  he  has  particular  expertise  with—green
chemistry.  With  an  undergraduate  degree  in  chemistry  followed  by  a  medical  de-
gree,  Dr.  Gingrey  has  long  been  an  advocate  for  increasing  government  research
into green chemistry.

Chemical  manufacturing  can  result  in  harm  to  human  health  and  the  environ-
ment  due  to  the  use  of  hazardous  materials  and  the  generation  of  hazardous  by-
products.  Green  chemistry  seeks  to  mitigate  such  harmful  outcomes.  In  short,  the
goal of green chemistry is to minimize or to eliminate this harm by using safer ma-
terials and manufacturing processes. Besides protecting human health and the envi-
ronment,  green  chemistry  can  offer  economic  advantages  and  improvements  to
worker safety, public safety, and our national security.

H.R.  2850,  the  Green  Chemistry  Research  and  Development  Act,  establishes  an
interagency  program  to  enhance  green  chemistry  R&D  at  NSF,  EPA,  DOE,  and
NIST.

This  legislation  will  provide  grants  to  individual  researchers,  spur  university/in-
dustry  partnerships,  fund  research  at  federal  laboratories,  and  train  students  in
green chemistry science.

H.R. 2850 is the third iteration of a bill that Congressman Gingrey has introduced
addressing this issue. Under Chairman Boehlert’s leadership in the 108th and 109th
Congresses,  Democratic  amendments  were  agreed  to  and  now  make  up  sections  of
H.R. 2850. This bill is the product of good bipartisan cooperation.

However, there was, and remains, apprehension among Democratic Members that
this Act simply does not go far enough to promote the adoption of green chemistry.

But  H.R.  2850  is  a  good  first  step,  and  I  urge  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee  to
support this legislation.

I  want  to  thank  all  the  Members  for  their  cooperation  and  participation  during
the  first  half  of  this  year.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  all  of  you  as  we  move  to-
ward the August recess.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, I thank you, and I have listened care-
fully  to  what  you  have  said,  and  it  is  obvious  that  we  want  to  get
along.  We  want  to  work  together.  We  have  from  here  back.  We
hope we can from here forward. And we thank you for holding this
markup  today,  and  I  am  very  pleased  that  we  are  marking  up  Dr.
Gingrey’s  Green  Chemistry  Research  and  Development  Bill  today.
It  is  a  good  bill.  It  has  passed  the  House  of  Representatives  twice
already,  and  hopefully,  this  time,  the  other  body  is  going  to  recog-
nize  its  merits.  But  it  seemed  like  I  am  more  inclined  to  want  to
have  some  questions,  some  parliamentary  inquiries,  but  let  me  go
on with my statement and see where we are going.

It  is  my  understanding  that  we  will  be  recessing  the  Committee
following consideration of Dr. Gingrey’s bill, H.R. 2850, I think that
is  what  I  gleaned  from  what  you  said.  I  am  disappointed  to  hear
that the Committee may not mark up H.R. 2337, the Energy Policy
Reform  and  Revitalization  Act  of  2007,  and  may  instead  have  an
exchange  of  letters  with  the  Resources  Committee  pending  agree-
ment  on  a  couple  of  provisions.  A  number  of  Members  on  our  side
of  the  aisle  have  expressed  concern  about  other  provisions  in  the
bill that are within the Committee’s jurisdiction.

For  instance,  there  is  concern  that  a  provision  of  H.R.  2337  es-
tablishes a new procurement program at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric  Administration,  yet  our  committee  has  not  even  held
a  hearing  on  this  provision.  I  had  hoped  that  we  could  have  a  full
and  open  debate  on  this  legislation.  I  have  a  number  of  concerns
with legislation. I am primarily concerned that it may have a nega-
tive effect on American consumers and our energy independence, as
I  have  expressed  on  a  number  of  occasions.  America  is  at  a  cross-
roads. We are faced with large energy challenges, such as an ever-
increasing demand for energy that will inevitably drive up costs for
our taxpayers, threaten our national security, and hamper our abil-
ity to compete in the world marketplace.

This concern is shared by several organizations that you are very
familiar with: the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association
of Manufacturers. I could go on and on—International Brotherhood
of  Electrical  Workers  and  on  and  on.  We  have  to  meet  these  chal-
lenges, energy challenges head-on, by increasing our domestic sup-
ply, using all available resources.

This  bill,  however,  could  move  our  country  in  the  opposite  direc-
tion.  It  repeals  several  bipartisan  provisions  of  the  Energy  Policy
Act  of  2005,  and  it  will  result  in  increased  dependence  on  foreign
energy, higher prices for American consumers, and a loss of Amer-
ican jobs. These are provisions in this bill that limit upgrading en-
ergy  transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  delay  development  of
oil shale and tar sands leasing contracts, add layers of bureaucracy
to  slow  oil  and  gas  operations,  impose  new  fees  on  oil  and  gas
leases, and establish new requirements that will make wind energy
absolutely unaffordable.

I  urge  the  Chairman  to  move  forward  with  the  markup  of  this
legislation,  in  this  committee.  The  Science  and  Technology  Com-

mittee  has  a  lot  to  add  to  the  debate.  I  would  be  disappointed  if
we didn’t to give our Members that opportunity.

And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  copies  of  numerous  letters  in  opposi-
tion  to  this  bill  that  I  would  like  to  offer  into  the  record  at  this
time, and I would like to yield to Mr. Gingrey for——

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  this  markup  today.  I  am  pleased  we  are
marking  up  Dr.  Gingrey’s  Green  Chemistry  Research  and  Development  bill  today.
This is a good bill that has passed the House of Representative twice already. Hope-
fully, this time the other body will recognize its merits.

It is my understanding that we will be recessing the Committee following consid-
eration  of  Dr.  Gingrey’s  bill,  H.R.  2850.  I  am  disappointed  to  hear  that  the  com-
mittee may not markup H.R. 2337, the Energy Policy Reform and Revitalization Act
of 2007, and may instead have an exchange of letters with the Resources Committee
pending  agreement  on  a  couple  of  provisions.  A  number  of  Members  on  our  side  of
the  aisle  have  expressed  concern  about  other  provisions  in  this  bill  that  are  within
this committee’s jurisdiction. For instance, there is concern that a provision of H.R.
2337  establishes  a  new  procurement  program  at  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric Administration, yet our committee has not even held a hearing on this provi-
sion. I had hoped that we could have a full and open debate on this legislation.

I  have  a  number  of  concerns  with  this  legislation.  I  am  primarily  concerned  that
it may have a negative effect on American consumers and our energy independence.
As  I  have  expressed  on  a  number  of  occasions,  America  is  at  a  crossroads.  We  are
faced  with  large  energy  challenges,  such  as  an  ever  increasing  demand  for  energy,
that will inevitably drive up costs for our taxpayers, threaten our national security,
and hamper our ability to compete in the world marketplace. This concern is shared
by  several  organizations,  such  as  the  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  National  Associa-
tion of Manufacturers, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.

We must meet these energy challenges head on by increasing our domestic supply
using  all  available  resources.  This  bill,  however,  moves  our  country  in  the  opposite
direction.  It  repeals  several  bipartisan  provisions  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005
and it will result in increased dependence on foreign energy, higher prices for Amer-
ican  consumers  and  a  loss  of  American  jobs.  There  are  provisions  in  this  bill  that
limit  upgrading  energy  transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  delay  development
of  oil  shale  and  tar  sands  leasing  contracts,  add  layers  of  bureaucracy  to  slow  oil
and  gas  operations,  impose  new  fees  on  oil  and  gas  leases,  and  establish  new  re-
quirements that will make wind energy unaffordable.

I  urge  the  Chairman  to  move  forward  with  the  markup  of  this  legislation  in  this
committee.  The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  has  a  lot  to  add  to  this  debate,
and I would be disappointed if we did not give our Members that opportunity.

Chairman GORDON. With no objection, the letters are to be made

a part of the record.

to Dr. Gingrey.

istry?

Mr. HALL. Thank you, sir, and I will yield the balance of my time

Chairman GORDON. If you don’t mind, is that on the green chem-

Mr. HALL. Yes.
Chairman  GORDON.  Let  me,  I  think  the  gentleman  raised  good

points. Before you yield, if you would yield to me.

Mr. HALL. Sure.
Chairman GORDON. You deserve to be responded to. We are wait-
ing for the Parliamentarian. I know there are some concerns on the
Resources  Bill.  As  I  understand  it  now,  we  are  only,  have  been
given  joint  jurisdiction  in  two  areas,  and  I  think  most  of  what  you
raised  are  outside  that,  and  I  would  like  to  ask  anybody  on  my
staff, I think the Parliamentarian may still be looking into a couple
of other areas where we have asked for that, and that’s one reason
that we have asked for this recess, to find out. Obviously, we can’t
be  marking  up  areas,  even  though  you  may  not  like  those  areas,
if  they’re  not  within  our  jurisdiction.  So,  you  will  understand  that.
Also,  we  are  preserving  our  right  to  have  a  markup  in  those
areas  where  we  do  have  that  jurisdiction,  and  we  are  working  in
a bipartisan, bi-committee effort to accomplish that. So, again, you
deserve an answer to those concerns, and I want to be sure you had
that.

Mr. HALL. Yes. I thank you, and I am glad to hear that you like
those.  You  noticed  seven,  so  you  must  have  liked  them,  and
thought we had jurisdiction.

Chairman  GORDON.  Right.  And  so  far,  the  Parliamentarian  has
said that we only have two, and so, unless they, you know, we are
still trying to, we are pushing for all of it, and——

Mr. HALL. Okay.
Chairman GORDON. But we can’t go where they don’t allow us to

Mr.  HALL.  All  right.  Then  the  parliamentary  inquiry,  is  H.R.

2337 on the markup notice? The answer to that is yes it is.

Chairman GORDON. Yes. Yes, sir.
Mr.  HALL.  And  why  is  it  on  the  notice  if  we  are  not  going  to

mark it up today?

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  because  right  now,  the  Parliamen-
tarian  only  gives  us,  has  only  responded  to  two  of  the  seven  areas
of  jurisdiction.  Secondly,  we  are  in  bipartisan,  bicameral  negotia-
tions, and I think that we are going to be better off if we can work
these  things  out  in  a  bipartisan,  bicameral,  not  bicameral,  excuse
me, bi-committee basis, rather than just slam bam, because I think
that  they  would  treat  us  the  same  way  with  our  bills,  and  again,
we  are  trying  to  establish,  with  Minority  and  Majority,  and  with
different committees, to treat each other, you know, we want to try
to have a Golden Rule here. I think we are better off by doing that.
Mr.  HALL.  What  is  the  exchange  of  letters  about  that  you  men-

go.

tioned.

Chairman  GORDON.  We  have  not  had  an  exchange  of  letters,  I
don’t  think,  yet,  until  we  reach  some  type  of  a  bipartisan,  and
again, a bicameral agreement.

286

Mr. HALL. Then, I guess, the question is what sections are being

discussed of the seven?

Chairman GORDON. They are, I will give you, let us see. If some-
one could, 441 and 473 are the ones where the Parliamentarian has
said that we have jurisdiction.

Mr. HALL. And are you working out a deal?
Chairman GORDON. And 303.
Mr.  HALL.  Are  you  working  out  a  deal  on  policy  on  these  seven

sections, on the full seven sections?

Chairman GORDON. No, sir, because we, the Parliamentarian has
not  said  that  we  have  jurisdiction  on  the  other  of  those  seven.  So,
right  now,  we  wrote  the  Parliamentarian,  in  conjunction  with  the
Minority  staff,  on  those  areas  where  we  thought  that  we  might
have  jurisdiction,  to  preserve  our  jurisdiction.  The  Parliamen-
tarian, again, as I understand it, and please, I do not want to mis-
represent this, so if I say something that someone has better infor-
mation, I welcome to be corrected. But it is my understanding that
they  have  not  referred  all  of  those  seven,  and  only  a  portion  of
those  to  us,  that  we  are  still  working  with  them  to  get  further  re-
ferral.  And  again,  I  stand,  I  welcome,  if  someone  has  better  infor-
mation.

Mr.  HALL.  That  is  not  my  understanding,  but  I  will  accept  your
explanation  at  this  time.  And  now,  can  I—if  I  have  any  time  left,
can I give it to Dr. Gingrey?

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I can move to strike the last word,

Chairman GORDON. Okay. And if I could, let me correct one more
thing.  It  is  a  tetanus  shot,  not  a  typhoid  shot.  So,  pardon  me  for,
I don’t want anybody to be, you know, getting stuck with the wrong
needle there.

Mr. FEENEY. A parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman, if it is ap-

and——

propriate.

Chairman GORDON. Certainly.
Mr.  FEENEY.  I  understood  the  Chairman  to  say  that  the  Parlia-
mentarian  has  said  we  have  jurisdiction  of  the  two  sections  that
were set out, but has the Parliamentarian said that we do not have
jurisdiction over the other five or seven sections in question?

Chairman GORDON. Let me check with our Parliamentarian, and

I will tell you.

It  is  my  understanding  that  we  went  to  the  Parliamentarian  on
all seven provisions. Resources countered on that, and said that we
didn’t. The Parliamentarian has ruled that we have jurisdiction on
two  of  those,  and  likely,  a  third,  but  unlikely  on  four  others.  And
again, this is another reason that we feel like that we are recessing
now on this issue until we get a more definitive issue from the Par-
liamentarian,  and  so  that  we,  again,  can  continue  our  conversa-
tions,  not  again,  it  is  more  than  just  protecting  jurisdiction.  It  is
trying  to  get  good  policy,  too,  and  trying,  again,  to  deal  with  an-
other committee in a way that is appropriate.

What  we  are  finding,  and  this  is  just  for  your  information,  what
we are finding is some committees are holding their bills to report
to  the  very  last  moment,  so  that  it  is  virtually  impossible  to  have
any  kind  of  input  there.  I  don’t  think  that  is  the  way  to  proceed,
and where those committees are working in good faith, I think that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:28 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729A.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

287

we  need  to  try  to  work  in  good  faith  with  them.  So,  that  is  where
we are, and if anyone else has any——

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Gingrey.
Mr. GINGREY. Well, I have a parliamentary inquiry as well.
Chairman GORDON. Okay. Yes.
Mr. GINGREY. And Mr. Chairman, thank you, and not necessarily

to beat a dead horse here——

Chairman GORDON. Are you satisfied?
Mr. FEENEY. Well, if I could——
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Feeney.
Mr.  FEENEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Just  a  quick  follow-up.
Would  the—obviously,  both  the  Majority  and  certainly  the  Chair-
man and the Minority as well would have an interest in not ceding
jurisdiction unnecessarily, because this is all of our committee. We
all have an interest in it.

Would it be appropriate for the Minority to weigh in with a letter
to  the  Parliamentarian,  as  he  makes  his  decision  about  these  last
five——

Chairman  GORDON.  We  would  welcome  that.  I  would  hope  that
our  original  letters  to  them  was  bipartisan.  I  mean,  I  hope  that  it
was,  but  if  it  wasn’t,  we  would  welcome  your  support  in  that,  and
best arguments.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  surely,  the  Parliamentarian  would  appreciate
us bringing it to his attention anything that may be relevant to his
decision.

Chairman GORDON. Sure.
Mr. FEENEY. And with that, I thank the Chairman for his——
Chairman GORDON. We wouldn’t have asked for referral on those

seven provisions if we weren’t interested in getting them.

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I think Mr. Feeney
and  I,  obviously,  are  thinking  on  the  same  wavelength  here  this
morning, because that was my point as well, and my parliamentary
inquiry  is,  since  you  scheduled  the  bill,  H.R.  2337,  to  be  marked
up this morning, with specific enumeration of the sections of which,
obviously, we would have jurisdiction, 303, 305, 306, 441, 447, 471,
472, and 473.

Chairman GORDON. I am not sure that we would. That is——
Mr.  GINGREY.  Well,  I  guess  my  inquiry  is,  has  the  Parliamen-
tarian  changed  his  mind?  And  to  follow  up  on  what  Mr.  Feeney
said, if he has, and the Parliamentarian, of course, by definition is
a  bipartisan  figure  that  represents  all  of  the  House,  then  all  of  us
should have an opportunity, both on the Minority and the Majority
side, both on the Science Committee and the Resources Committee,
where  this  bill  was  debated  for  12  hours,  and  passed  on  a  26–22
vote,  so  certainly  not  an  uncontroversial  piece  of  legislation,  that
is  the  Parliamentarian  is  going  to  be  changing  his  mind,  then  we
should  have  input  as  well  in  this  interim,  while  we  are  discussing
which sections are going to be germane to our committee.

Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  gentleman  would  yield,  again,  let  me
tell  you  how  I  understand  the  situation  to  be.  We  made,  we  asked
the  Parliamentarian  for  joint  jurisdiction  in  seven  areas.  The  Par-
liamentarian  has  said  you  have  jurisdiction  in  two.  You  probably
have  jurisdiction  in  a  third.  We  have  not  made  a  decision  on  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:28 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729A.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

quickly——

yet.  And  you  probably  do  not  have  jurisdiction  in  four  areas.  And
so, we welcome your letter, and any other thoughtful letters to the
Parliamentarian, and efforts to, you know, establish those jurisdic-
tional concerns.

I will point out, well——
Mr. GINGREY. Well, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Chairman GORDON. That is where we are.
Mr.  GINGREY.  I  understand  what  you  said,  I  just  want  very

Chairman GORDON. Sure.
Mr. GINGREY. Very briefly, I would say based on the information
that  we  received,  Members  maybe  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  but
certainly  on  this  side,  including  yours  truly,  has  a  very  thoughtful
amendment,  he  thinks,  to  Section  306,  which  would  make  the  bill
a much better bill. So, we are very concerned about that, and I ap-
preciate the Chairman’s indulgence.

Mr. HALL. Make a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. The gentleman from Texas is recognized.
Mr.  HALL.  Is  it  our  intention  to  mark  up  at  least  two  sections?
Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  it  is  our  intention  to  work  on  a  bipar-
tisan  basis  with  the  Resources  Committee  in  an  effort  to  work
those  out.  If  a  markup  is  necessary,  we  may  have  a  markup,  but
it is not—it has not been determined yet whether that is necessary.
Mr.  HALL.  You  noticed  them  for  seven,  and  they  said  two  are
good,  and  we  are  here  and  ready.  Why  is  it  we  are  not  going  to
have a markup on the two?

Chairman GORDON. Well, by the same reasoning——
Mr.  HALL.  And  we  want  to  work  together,  and  we  got  sense

enough.

Chairman GORDON. Sure. Yeah.
Mr.  HALL.  You  know  my  old  story  about  my  mathematical  prob-

lem, but I still can count.

Chairman GORDON. Right. Yes.
Mr. HALL. And we can get outvoted, and we understand that. We

don’t mind that, as long as we have some input on it.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  it  is  my  understanding  that  your  staff
has been in on all of the meetings. I think one of those two sections
was  worked  out  yesterday  on  a  bipartisan  basis,  and  I  think  there
was a meeting this afternoon on the second one, and it would seem
to  me  as  long  as  we  have  got  bipartisan,  bi-committee  meetings
going  on,  it  would  be  a  little  bit  presumptuous  to  try  to  have  a
markup when we are still working to work these things out.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  satisfied,  but  I  am  not  happy.  I

will yield back my time to you.
Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  Certainly.  The  gentleman  from  Michigan,

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to add to this, a lit-
tle  bit  of  history  and  concern  on  my  part.  As  we  know,  this  com-
mittee  has  been  the  youngest  committee  of  the  Congress  for  many
years,  until  Homeland  Security  came  along,  and  when  it  was  cre-
ated, it was given pretty much jurisdiction over the space program,
but most of the other committees were reluctant to give up jurisdic-
tion over things that should have been assigned to this committee,

Mr. Ehlers.

289

for  example,  the  nuclear  power  program  still  is  in  Energy  and
Commerce. It clearly belongs under our jurisdiction. And I can give
many other examples.

I have also observed, in my years here, that we are often victim-
ized  by  the  big,  powerful  committees  who  claim  jurisdiction,  and
fight  very  hard  to  get  jurisdiction  over  things  that  we  are  working
on, and I have had several of my bills stymied just for that reason,
stymied  to  the  point  that  they  were  delayed  a  couple  years.  So,  I
would urge you, Mr. Chairman, to fight strenuously to maintain as
much jurisdiction as you can possibly get. Arguing with the parlia-
mentarians, arguing with the Resources Committee.

In  fact,  one  of  my  bills,  which  deals  with  invasive  species,  was
basically  stopped  by  the  Resources  Committee  over  a  dispute  like
this. So, I would urge you to fight hard, because this poor little old
Science Committee often is victimized by this big, powerful commit-
tees  that  have  been  around  for  a  century  or  more,  and  I  think  we
have to fight for every little bit that we can get. So I encourage you
to put up a huge battle, and try to get all seven of those things put
in our jurisdiction. Thank you.

Chairman  GORDON.  Mr.  Ehlers,  let  me  point  out,  it  is  not  just

Resources. It is going to be Energy and Commerce.

Mr. EHLERS. Yeah.
Chairman  GORDON.  It  is  going  to  be  Agriculture.  We  are  going
to have a number of areas where there is going to be joint jurisdic-
tion.  A  part  of  the  reason  that,  again,  these  staff  and  Members
have  worked  so  hard,  was  to  make  us  relevant,  and  to  get  us  into
these battles. You can be well assured that we are going to be hold-
ing our ground, and again, a part of our objective, my objective, so
far,  is  to  make  this  committee  more  relevant.  That  is  why  we  are
going to be, we are getting into health care IT, we are getting into
financial  security,  data  security.  I  mean,  you  are  going  to  see  this
committee  cast  a  wider  net,  using  NIST,  using  a  number  of  areas.
So, we are not pulling back. We are going forward.

I will give you a quick little note. I was talking with John Dingell
a  while  back,  and  I  was  real  proud.  I  was  telling  him,  you  know,
I  was  explaining  the  origin  of  the  Science  Committee  and  some  of
the things that, you know, that we are doing, and he sort of looked
at  me  gruffly,  and  said:  ‘‘I  am  well  aware  of  the  origin  of  the
Science  Committee,  because  most  of  your  jurisdiction  came  from
us.’’

So, we will be there.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Right.  And  I  just  think,  since  we  are  the  only  com-
mittee  that  knows  how  to  make  nuclear  weapons,  we  should  have
a little more respect around here.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Yes, sir.
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  Along  with  that,  I  don’t  know  if  this  is  nec-
essarily  a  parliamentary  inquiry,  but  I  guess  it  is.  In  other  words,
we  have  scheduled  a  Committee  markup  today  for  a  bill  that  we
are not going to mark up. Is that correct?

Chairman  GORDON.  We  gave  notice,  and  the  reason  is  that  we
are in a bipartisan, bi-committee—let me give you an example. Let

it was marked up, and the Republicans had some amendments that

were  good,  but  we  got  them  late.  Well,  we  could  say,  you  know,  to
heck  with  you,  we  are  going  to  go  ahead  and  mark  this  up,  or  we
could say you made a good faith effort to get involved with this bill.
Why don’t we wait a day or two, and try to work these things out?
It  is  the  same  situation,  I  think,  with  the  Natural  Resources
Committee.  Right  now,  we  have  bipartisan,  bi-committee  negotia-
tions going on, and it would seem to me that it would be, the more
prudent  thing  is  to  let  these  talks  proceed,  and  narrow  the  issues,
and  then,  we  can  go  forward.  We  are  preserving  our  right,  make
no mistake about it, we are preserving our right to have a markup
if that is necessary.

Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  I  guess  that—the  point  I  was  making,  Mr.

Chairman, are we going to mark up this bill?

Chairman GORDON. If we feel it is necessary.
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  Who  is  going  to  determine  if  it  is  necessary

will?

Chairman GORDON. The Chairman will.
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  mean,  is  something  as
important as national energy policy in this country, for those kinds
of decisions to be made in closed door meetings, behind——

Chairman GORDON. They are not going to be made in closed door

Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  Well,  they  are  not  in  this  meeting.  This  is  a

public forum.

Chairman GORDON. Well, let me make—what time is the meeting
this afternoon? Okay, at 4:00 this afternoon, all of your staff knows
that  there  is  a  bipartisan,  bi-committee  meeting,  just  like  all  your
staff  have  been  involved  in  the  other  ones.  You  are  welcome,  and
any Member is welcome to attend those.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Well, what about——
Chairman GORDON. The door is not closed.
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  What  about  Members  of  this  committee,  on
our side, and maybe on your side, too, that have amendments, that
they  think  would  make  this  bill  better,  and  want  an  open,  and  as
I remember, the Chairman’s remarks when he opened up this com-
mittee  for  the  first  time  as  the  new  Chairman,  said  we  are  going
to work in a bipartisan, open way. We are going to have markups.
We are going to discuss. We are going to work on this product, and
at the end, we are going to vote on it. And that is the process that
we  are  going  to  move  forward  with,  and  yet,  today,  what  we  are
told,  is  well,  we  are  going  to  put  this  on  the  agenda,  but  we  are
going to work out the details behind the door with Committee staff,
and when I like it, then it is moving forward without any open de-
bate and consideration for this committee.

Chairman GORDON. Well, you know, I guess it is one of those two
people  can  see  an  accident  and  see  it  different  ways.  The  fact  of
the matter is, once again, let me, this is how we proceed with most
bills. We start off with bipartisan discussion, on the staff level, rep-
resenting  you—you  are  welcome  to  attend—so  that  we  can  narrow
those  issues,  that  we  can  try  to,  you  know,  knock  down  the  edges,
so that we can have informed markups.

The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  you  are  more  than  welcome  to  attend
the  afternoon—you  are  already  noticed  about  it.  You  are  welcome
to  attend  that  meeting.  And  we  would  hope  that  you  would.  Bring

your  best  ideas.  Let  them  be  discussed,  in  a  bipartisan,  again  bi-
committee way, and that is the way we should proceed.

Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  But  can  we  do  that,  and  then  bring  that,
whatever  everybody  thinks  is  kind  of  the  consensus  product,  then,
back  to  this  committee,  and  let  us  debate  it,  and  make  sure  that
there is a consensus to do that.

Chairman GORDON. Well, that is the way we are proceeding.
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  Well,  no,  you  told  me  that  we  weren’t  going

to mark this bill up.

Chairman GORDON. No, I did not tell you that.
Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I asked the question, and you said no.
Chairman GORDON. No. No. I said that has not been determined,

whether it is going to be necessary to.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Well, the answer to my question, are we going

to mark up this bill, you said if it is necessary. Is that——

Mr. HALL. Would the gentleman yield.
Mr. NEUGEBAUER. You just repeat, so that——
Chairman GORDON. That is not a no.
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  But  then  you  told  me,  and  you  were  going  to

determine if it is necessary.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  ultimately,  the  Chairman  will,  in  con-

sultation with the Minority and the Majority. Certainly.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I yield to the gentleman.
Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  it  reminds  me  of  a  question  I  asked
a  company  to  loan  us  some  money,  and  they  said  I  will  listen  to
your ignorant proposal with an open mind. I don’t like the position
I  am  in,  but  once  again,  I  can  count.  But  it  seems  to  me,  and  the
Chairman  is  a  man  of  character  and  a  long  time  friend,  but  it
seemed  like  having  a  markup  is  holding  the  ground.  You  talked
about  holding  the  ground.  I  think  that  we  are  holding  our  ground
if you go on and have this markup. What is to keep you from doing
that?

Chairman GORDON. Because the issues haven’t been fully vetted,
and it would be, it would seem to me that it would be irresponsible
to  move  forward  when  we  have  just  gotten  this,  you  know,  right
now,  the  Parliamentarian  hasn’t  even  told  us  whether  we  have  ju-
risdiction  in  five  areas.  We  are  still  trying  to  get  those  five  areas
of jurisdiction.

I mean, it is sort of difficult to mark up a bill that you don’t have
jurisdiction on, and we don’t know that yet. So, and that is the rea-
son  that  we  want  to  give  full  notice,  and  we  have  given  notice,  so
that—and the reason that we are recessing is to keep the hammer
on the Resource Committee to know that we can have this markup.
And  again,  I  think  most  of  the  concern  that,  and  particularly  my
friends  from  the  oil  producing  area  in  Texas  are  having,  are  in
those  areas  of  the  Resource  Bill  that  we  don’t  have  jurisdiction,  at
least we haven’t been given it yet.

So, I mean, I think that is the main concern, isn’t it?
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  My  main  concern  is  just  that  I  think  every
other issue that has come before this committee, I have sat in here
under  the  Chairman’s  leadership,  and  have  appreciated  the  very
open  exchange  between  ideas  brought  forward  on  both  sides,  but
yet on what I think may be the most important piece of legislation
that the 110th Congress will act on, it is being approached in a dif-

ferent  manner,  and  quite  honestly,  I  think  it  shortchanges  the
American people. They, you allude to staff, and——
Chairman GORDON. Would the gentleman yield?
Mr. NEUGEBAUER. As soon as I finish.
Chairman GORDON. Okay, sure.
Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Yeah. The gentleman alludes to staff. We have
very  capable  staff,  but  the  American  people  sent  the  people  that
are  sitting  on  this  side  of  the  room  to  debate  these  ideas  and  dis-
cussions, and come up with what is, in our estimation, the best pol-
icy  for  this  country  moving  forward  with  energy.  Because  quite
honestly, maybe the greatest security risk this country faces today
is energy, and something as important as that, I don’t think should
be  done  with  letters  and  people’s  prerogative.  I  think  it  ought  to
be  done  in  an  open  and  fair  way,  so  that  the  American  taxpayers
can see that we did give this full consideration.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  agree  with  you,  but  again,  let  me  again
point  out  we  can’t  mark  up  provisions  that  we  don’t  have  jurisdic-
tion on, and I think your concerns are virtually exclusively in areas
that  we  have  not  yet  been  given  jurisdiction.  So,  we  cannot  mark
up, just like we can’t mark up the dairy subsidies. I am concerned
about  dairy  subsidies.  I  am  concerned,  you  know,  about  a  variety
of  issues,  but  we  don’t  have  jurisdiction.  So,  you  cannot  mark  up
a  bill.  I  guess  you  could,  if  we  want  to  take,  you  know,  the  time
to  go  through  some  kind  of  faux  exercise,  but  it  is  simply  not,  and
I  guess  the  easy  thing  would  have  been  not  to  have  even  talked
about  it.  We  wouldn’t  have  had  this,  but  I  didn’t  think  that  was
a fair thing either.

You  know,  we  are  putting  a  notice,  so  that  we  can  hold  a  ham-
mer  over  the  Resources  Committee,  to  know  that  we  are  going  to
preserve  our  right  to  mark  up  bills  that  we  have  jurisdiction  on,
and  that  is  the  way  we  are  going  to  proceed.  And  I  think  Mr.
Gingrey  deserves  now  to  move  forward.  I  mean,  I  welcome  any-
thing else——

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman. On the left side, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Yes, sir.
Mr. BAIRD. I would just make two quick observations. First of all,
I,  as  many  people  know,  have  been  long  a  champion  of  an  open
process  here  in  this  body,  and  believe  we  should  have  it  at  the
Committee level and at the public level, but I think it would be un-
fair  to  imply  that  this  committee  has  not  had  hearings  on  energy.
We  have  had  a  number  of  hearings  on  energy  since  this  Congress
began,  and  those  hearings  have  had  a  good  give  and  take  about
various  policies  and  their  effects  on  our  economy  and  our  environ-
ment and other things.

So, we have had hearings, and the markup is a place where you
debate the particular amendments, but to suggest that this markup
would  come  up  without  any  hearings  on  energy,  I  think,  is  inac-
curate.  And  I,  just  for  the  record,  I  would  just  point  out  that  my
dear  friends  on  the  other  side  of  the  aisle  voted  repeatedly  in  the
last  and  prior  Congresses  to  that,  unanimously,  or  nearly  so,  for
rules  that  allowed  bills  such  as  the  Medicare  bill  to  come  to  the
Floor  of  the  House  with  less  than  24  hours  for  review,  and  not  a
single  amendment  offered,  that  they  locked  the  Chairman  of  the
Ways  and  Means  Committee  out  of  conference  committees,  and

that  standard  operating  procedure,  standard  operating  procedure
in  the  prior  Congress  was  that  the  more  important  the  legislation,
the  less  public  the  process,  and  the  less  input  the  minority  party
had.

So,  I  find  it  admirable  that  my  friends  on  the  other  side  have
come to realize that a fair and open process is part of a democratic
republic,  but  I  would  ask  them  where  the  heck  they  were,  where
were they, when those votes were taken on the Floor. I don’t recall
a  single  Member  of  that  party  saying  to  their  leadership  in  public
this  is  wrong.  This  is  wrong.  You  ought  to  allow  the  Minority  an
opportunity for amendments. You ought to allow time for delibera-
tion,  and  you  ought  not  lock  the  Chairman  of  a  committee  out  of
a conference committee.

I yield back.
Chairman GORDON. I think we need to move on. Let me just say,
I  think  that  is  an  example  of  what  we  don’t  want  to  do.  We  are
trying  to  do  better,  and  every  provision  within  the  Resources  Bill
that we have been given jurisdiction on now is, there is bipartisan,
bi-committee discussions on that, with an open door, and you know,
you can’t do any more than that

And  so,  with  no  objection,  I  would  like  to  proceed  to  Mr.

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, I do object.
Chairman GORDON. Okay.
Mr. HALL. I would like to strike the last word for just a moment,

Gingrey’s bill.

if I might.

Chairman GORDON. Certainly. Mr. Hall is recognized.
Mr. HALL. I stated in my opening statement there is concern that
a  provision  in  H.R.  2337  establishes  a  new  procurement  program
at  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  yet  our
committee  has  not  even  had  a  hearing  on  this,  and  that  is  what
I  said,  and  I  don’t  remember  having  a  hearing.  If  we  did,  correct
me, but that is, we have not had a hearing on Section 473. It could
cost up to $100 million a year, and I just think that we talk about
government  in  the  sunshine.  If  the  Republicans  did  it,  they
shouldn’t  have,  and  if  the  Democrats  are  going  to  do  it,  I  don’t
think you would be proud of it.

Let  us  go  forward.  We  will  work  our  way  as  it  goes,  and  I  yield

back my time.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  Again,  at  4:00  today,

that will be discussed in an open door manner.

Dr. Gingrey is recognized.
Mr. GINGREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am recognized for the

Green Chemistry Bill.

Chairman GORDON. I would hope so.
Mr. GINGREY. Yeah. I would hope so, too, after that long, lengthy

discussion. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your continued comity.

Chairman  GORDON.  Mr.  Gingrey,  why  don’t  we,  we  are  still  in
the  area,  before  we  take  up  your  bill,  I  think  Mr.  Wu  had  a  com-
ment  that  he  wanted  to  make  on  the  bill,  and  then,  we  will  take,
we will let other statements be placed in the record.

Mr.  WU.  No,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  would  like  to  follow  Dr.  Gingrey

in making a very brief statement on the Green Chemistry Bill.

Chairman GORDON. Okay.

Mr.  WU.  But  I  very  much,  at  this  point  in  time,  look  forward  to

the markup on the green chemistry bill.

Chairman  GORDON.  Okay.  All  right.  So,  we  will  now  consider
H.R.  2850,  the  Green  Chemistry  Research  and  Development  Act  of
2007.

I  yield  to  the  gentleman  from  Georgia  five  minutes  to  describe

his bill.

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I want to thank you
especially,  and  of  course,  I  want  to  thank  Ranking  Member  Mr.
Hall.  I  want  to  thank  the  original  co-sponsors,  my  Subcommittee
Chairman,  David  Wu,  Mr.  Ehlers,  Mr.  Mario  Diaz-Balart,  and  Mr.
Welch  of  Vermont,  who  is  not  a  Member  of  this  committee,  but
very, very interested in this subject.

I do appreciate, Chairman Gordon, you working very closely with
me and with us on this very important, bipartisan piece of legisla-
tion. In your opening remarks, Mr. Chairman, you mentioned some
of  the  history  of  the  Green  Chemistry  Research  and  Development
Act,  and  it  goes  back  to  the  108th  Congress.  And  of  course,  as  you
pointed  out,  it  passed  the  108th  with  a  wide  bipartisan  margin.
You talked about the 109th, when you were Ranking Member, and
again, I think on the Floor it, under suspension, it passed by voice
vote. And then, right at the end of the day, when we approached—
Mr. Chairman, you remember I had a conversation with you about
this bill, and you did everything humanly possible to get the other
body  to  get  it  through,  and  at  the  very  last  minute,  a  Member  of
my  party  put  a  closet  hold,  for  whatever  reason,  I  don’t  know,  but
I  just  want  to,  as  we  get  into  discussion  of  the  bill,  thank  you  for
your  efforts  and  your  commitment  to  me,  and  this  is  good  legisla-
tion. I am pleased that we could work together to bring it through
the  Committee  again,  and  I  hope  the  third  time  will  truly  be  the
charm, that we will see H.R. 2850 quickly passed by both chambers
and signed by the President.

In  the  way  of  explanation,  H.R.  2850,  the  Green  Chemistry  Re-
search  and  Development  Act,  it  establishes  a  program  that  pro-
motes and coordinates federal green chemistry research and devel-
opment  activities  within  several  federal  agencies,  specifically  the
NSF,  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  Environmental  Protec-
tion  Agency,  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,
NIST, and of course, the Department of Energy.

Chemists  can  design  chemicals  to  be  safe,  just  like  they  can  de-
sign  them  to  have  other  properties  like  color  and  texture.  This
technique of considering not only the process in which products are
manufactured, but also, the environment in which they are created,
is  the  basic  definition  of  green  chemistry.  That  is  basically  what
this bill is all about. It is a method of designing chemical products
and processes that, at the very least, reduce, and at the very best,
eliminate the use or generation of hazardous material.

The basic idea is this, preventing pollution and hazardous waste
from  the  start  of  the  design  process  is  a  lot  more  preferable  to
cleaning  up  that  mess,  pollution,  and  waste  at  a  later  date.  Addi-
tionally, the innovation created by this enhanced research will sub-
sequently  spur  economic  growth,  as  developing  new  products  and
processes is an integral component of many industries, from fabrics
to fuel cells. Green chemistry doesn’t just help protect our environ-

295

ment;  it  protects  our  workers,  too.  The  conditions  under  which
chemicals  are  created  and  used  present  many  risks  to  those  who
work on their production, but if companies utilize green chemistry,
the materials they use will be as benign as possible, and vastly im-
prove employee conditions.

Unfortunately,  despite  all  the  promise  of  green  chemistry,  the
Federal  Government  invests  very  little  in  this  area.  H.R.  2850
works  to  remedy  this  by  promoting  greater  federal  investment  in
and coordination of this important research area.

And  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  thank,  as  you  pointed  out  earlier,
the  excellent  staff  of  both  the  Majority  and  the  Minority  of  the
Science Committee, and working with us, and I think, indeed, even
improving this bill in regard to authorizing additional funding, but
only  in  the  proportion  that  we  have  already  increased  the  funding
of those particular agencies, basically, at the same percentage.

So,  make  no  mistake,  greater  federal  attention  will  encourage
universities  and  academic  institutions  around  the  country  to  train
future  workers  in  this  exciting  technology.  H.R.  2850  will  achieve
this by supporting research and development grants to partnership
between  universities,  industry,  and  nonprofit  organizations.  It  will
also  promote  education  through  curriculum  development  and  fel-
lowships  that  will  collect  and  disseminate  information  about  green
chemistry.

In  past  years,  many  industries,  from  chemical  companies  and
pharmaceutical  corporations,  to  carpet  manufacturers  and  bio-
technology  businesses  have  endorsed  this  bill,  showing  a  broad
range of support for the merits of the legislation. This bill, as I say,
is  nearly  identical  to  the  version  passed  in  the  108th  and  109th,
and  the  companies  and  corporations  that  have  voiced  their  strong
support  for  this  bill  realize  that  the  advancement  of  green  chem-
istry  is  positive,  not  only  for  their  specific  business,  but  also,  for
the  country’s  environment,  our  economy,  and  our  nation’s  citizens.
I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  H.R.  2850.  I  know  there  are  a
couple  of  amendments,  Mr.  Chairman,  on  the  Democratic  side.  I
know  Mr.  Lipinski  has  an  amendment,  and  I  want  to  thank  him,
the  gentleman  from  Illinois,  for  offering  it.  I  agree  with  him  that
one of the most basic and underrated steps toward a greener envi-
ronment  is  to  encourage  recycling.  That  saves  energy,  and  it  de-
creases  solid  waste,  and  I  believe  adding  recycling  to  the  Green
Chemistry Research and Development Act strengthens the bill, and
I  would  be  glad  to  accept  the  amendment  from  the  gentleman,  my
friend from Illinois.

And  then,  there  is  another  amendment  from  the  gentlewoman
from  Texas,  Ms.  Eddie  Bernice  Johnson,  and  her  amendment,
again, is something that I am supportive of, and I am sure she will
speak to that in just a few minutes.

So,  in  closing,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  your  indulgence.  I
know  I  went  beyond  my  five  minutes,  but  I  urge  my  colleagues,
please support H.R. 2850, and I do yield back at this time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gingrey follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY

Thank you, Mr. Hall, for yielding me time to describe my bill.

for working with me on this bill. This legislation has passed the House of Represent-

atives  in  both  the  108th  and  109th  Congresses,  and  I  am  pleased  we  could  work
together  to  bring  it  through  this  committee  again.  I  hope  the  third  time  will  truly
be  the  charm  and  that  we  see  H.R.  2850  quickly  passed  by  both  chambers  and
signed by the President.

H.R. 2850, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act, establishes a pro-
gram  that  promotes  and  coordinates  federal  green  chemistry  research  and  develop-
ment  activities  within  several  federal  agencies.  Specifically,  the  National  Science
Foundation,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  the  National  Institute  of  Stand-
ards and Technology, and the Department of Energy.

Chemists can design chemicals to be safe, just like they can design them to have

tegral component of many industries, from fabrics to fuel cells.

Green  chemistry  doesn’t  just  help  protect  our  environment,  it  helps  protect  our

present many risks to those who work on their production. But if companies utilize

ment  invests  very  little  in  this  area.  H.R.  2850  works  to  remedy  this  by  promoting
greater federal investment in and coordination of this important research area.

Make  no  mistake:  greater  federal  attention  will  encourage  universities  and  aca-

nology.  H.R.  2850  will  achieve  this  by  supporting  research  and  development  grants
to  partnerships  between  universities,  industry  and  non-profit  organizations.  It  will
also promote education through curricula development and fellowships that will col-
lect and disseminate information about green chemistry.

In  past  years,  many  industries—from  chemical  companies  and  pharmaceutical
corporations  to  carpet  manufacturers  and  biotechnology  businesses—have  endorsed
H.R. 2850, showing a broad range of support for the merits of this legislation. This
bill is nearly identical to the version passed in the 109th Congress.

The companies and corporations that have voiced their strong support for this bill
realize  that  the  advancement  of  green  chemistry  is  positive  for  not  only  their  busi-
nesses,  but  also  our  country’s  environment,  our  economy  and  our  nation’s  citizens.
I  urge  my  colleagues  to  support  H.R.  2850  and  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my

time.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Gingrey.  I  know  you  have
worked  long  and  hard.  I  hope  we  are  going  to  get  this  done.  Let
me ask to report now to, the Clerk to report the bill.

Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Wu, if you would, please, we need to re-

port the bill.

The  CLERK.  H.R.  2850,  to  provide  for  the  implementation  of  the
Green  Chemistry  Research  and  Development  Program,  and  for
other purposes.

Chairman  GORDON.  With  unanimous  consent,  the  reading  of  the

bill is dispensed with, and Mr. Wu is recognized.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  wanted  to  make  a  brief
statement to recognize that we have a good bill for us. It is a bipar-
tisan bill. I want to recognize the hard work of Dr. Gingrey to bring
this bill back to the Committee, and again, back to the Floor.

We  have  passed  this  bill  a  couple  of  times  through  this  com-
mittee,  and  we  have  passed  it  through  the  entire  House.  This  is  a
good  bill  that  deserves  to  become  legislation.  It  is  long  past  due,
and with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Our  nation  has  a  long  history  of  innovation  in  chemical  engineering,  but  along
the  way  chemical  production  has  become  somewhat  notorious  for  hurting  the  envi-
ronment.

The Green Chemistry Research and Development Act takes important steps toward

cleaning up the chemical research and manufacturing industry.

It  puts  money  into  our  prized  research  institutions  to  find  ways  to  ensure  that
the  progress  we  make  in  chemical  engineering  does  not  damage  the  environment.
Additionally, it encourages governmental agencies, like the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency and the National Science Foundation, to work closely together to estab-
lish clean chemistry standards.

Similar  versions  of  this  bill  passed  the  House  in  both  the  108th  and  109th  Con-

gresses with strong bipartisan support.

I  am  looking  forward  to  what  I  hope  will  be  the  Committee’s  favorable  consider-

ation of it again today.

I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman  GORDON.  Does  anyone  else  wish  to  be  recognized?  If
not,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  bill  is  considered  as  read
and  open  to  amendment  at  any  point,  and  that  the  Members  pro-
ceed  with  the  amendments  in  the  order  of  the  roster.  Without  ob-
jection, so ordered.

The  first  amendment  on  the  roster  is  offered  by  the  gentleman
from  Illinois,  Mr.  Lipinski.  Are  you  ready  to  proceed  with  your
amendment?

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. The Clerk will report the amendment.

Chairman  GORDON.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with

the reading. Without objection, so ordered.

The  gentleman  is  recognized  for  five  minutes  to  explain  the

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you.
My amendment is a very simple thing, a small, yet important ad-
dition to the underlying bill. The amendment actually is two words,
‘‘increase recycling.’’

The  amendment  would  help  supply  chain  manufacturers  to  in-
crease  recycling  with  the  goal  of  reducing  or  even  eliminating  the
use  or  generation  of  hazardous  substances.  Manufacturing  exten-
sion partnership centers, or MEP centers, would assist in these ef-
forts,  as  they  work  to  enhance  the  productivity  and  technological
performance of U.S. manufacturers.

I  firmly  believe  by  incorporating  innovative  recycling  practices
into their manufacturing processes, American industries will better
position  themselves  to  compete  in  the  increasingly  global  market-
place.  In  addition,  through  the  increased  practice  of  recycling,  our
manufacturers  will  help  to  reduce  the  production  of  solid  and  haz-
ardous waste, and improve our environment, and potentially lower
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  make  our  country  more  secure  by
lessening our need for foreign sources of energy.

The  MEP  centers  do  a  great  job.  I  have  a  lot  of  manufacturers
in  my  district  who  work  very  well  with  the  MEP  centers,  and  I
think this is, just a great opportunity to improve this bill by adding
recycling  in  there.  I  applaud  Dr.  Gingrey’s  work  on  this  bill.  I  am

pleased that Chairman Gordon has worked for its passage. I would
like to thank the Committee staff and Dr. Gingrey for working with
me and accepting my amendment.

It is a very good bill. Hopefully, the third time is a charm. I was
just  thinking  about  this.  Maybe—Dr.  Gingrey  no  longer  has  the
mustache.  Maybe  that  will  be  the  change.  Maybe  that  will  be  the
difference.  This  Congress  will  get  the  Senate  to  go  ahead  and  also
accept this, pass this bill. But——

Mr.  GINGREY.  If  the  gentleman  will  yield.  I  will  admit  to  being

shameless. I will do anything.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  I  encourage  all  my  colleagues  to  support  this

amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Ms.  JOHNSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  won’t  take  the  five
minutes.  I  will  submit  the  statement.  I  simply  want  to  say  that  I
strongly  support  the  bill,  and  I  appreciate  Dr.  Gingrey  accepting
this  amendment,  which  merely  says  ‘‘Minority-serving  institutions
shall  receive  due  consideration  for  such  funding.’’  And  that  is  the
end of it. I yield back the balance of my time, and ask that the bill
be passed.

PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE  MARKUP  BY  THE  SUB-
COMMITTEE  ON  TECHNOLOGY  AND  INNO-
VATION  ON  H.R.  5789,  THE  SCIENCE  AND
TECHNOLOGY  INNOVATION  ACT  OF  2008

WEDNESDAY,  APRIL  16,  2008

SUBCOMMITTEE ON TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE,

Washington, DC.

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  2:08  p.m.,  in  Room
2318 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. David Wu [Chair-
man of the Subcommittee] presiding.

Chairman WU. Good afternoon. The Subcommittee on Technology
and Innovation will now come to order, and pursuant to notice, the
Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation meets to consider the
following  measure:  H.R.  5789,  the  Science  and  Technology  Innova-
tion  Act  of  2008. We  will  now  proceed  with  the  markup,  beginning
with opening statements, and the Chair recognizes himself.

I want to welcome everyone to the Subcommittee markup of H.R.
5789,  the  Science  and  Technology  Innovation  Act  of  2008.  This  bill
reauthorizes  two  programs  critical  to  the  competitiveness  of  the
United  States,  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Program,
or  SBIR,  and  the  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  Program,
STTR. Our committee has been working on this bill for quite some
time,  and  I  want  to  thank  Ranking  Member  Phil  Gingrey  and  all
of  the  Members  of  the  Committee  for  continuing  our  work  in
crafting legislation which supports innovation.

In  today’s  economy,  small  business  is  often  where  innovation
comes from. The Science and Technology Committee, and especially
the  Technology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee,  intends  to  promote
science  and  technology  research  that  drives  an  innovation-based
economy.  SBIR  and  STTR  are  key  components  of  our  innovation
agenda.  At  more  than  $2.3  billion  per  year,  SBIR  and  STTR  com-
prise the largest source of federal support for technology innovation
for the private sector. These funds help companies with innovative
ideas  bring  their  products  to  market  to  create  both  new  products
and  jobs.  However,  these  programs  originated  more  than  20  years
ago, and much has changed since then. These programs need to be
restructured  to  reflect  the  current  global  competitive  environment,
and  the  Technology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee  held  numerous
hearings  last  year  on  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  to  analyze
their place in an innovation agenda for the 21st century.

Our  witnesses  made  many  suggestions  on  how  the  SBIR  and
STTR programs could be strengthened. During hearings for the re-
authorization  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  witnesses
said  that  programs  like  SBIR  and  STTR  are  necessary  if  the  U.S.
is going to capture the economic benefits of our federal investment

ments in basic research and end with new jobs, new products, and
new  services.  Members  of  this  committee  agree  on  the  importance
of  our  high-tech  entrepreneurial  companies  in  creating  new  tech-
nologies,  and  these  are  exactly  the  companies  targeted  by  SBIR.
STTR  links  these  small  high-tech  companies  with  our  universities,
which are a key creator of new high-tech ideas.

Based  upon  this  subcommittee’s  hearings,  H.R.  5789  will  do  the
following:  it  reauthorizes  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  through
2010.  Although  this  period  is  short,  it  will  put  both  programs  on
the same reauthorization cycle. In addition, the authorization time-
frame  will  give  Congress  time  to  examine  how  well  each  program
is working to better focus on innovation. Next, for any federal agen-
cy which spends more than $100 million per year on extramural re-
search,  it  would  set  increases  to  3.0  percent  for  SBIR  and  to  0.6
percent  for  STTR.  This  emphasizes  the  importance  we  place  upon
SBIR  and  STTR  as  part  of  the  innovation  agenda.  Third,  this  bill
increases  phase-one  awards  from  $100,000  to  $300,000,  and  it  in-
creases  phase-two  awards  from  $750,000  to  $2.2  million  to  better
reflect  the  actual  costs  of  doing  high-tech  research  in  today’s  envi-
ronment.  Number  four,  it  increases  the  flexibility  of  the  SBIR  pro-
gram  by  allowing  cross-agency  awards  and  allowing  applicants  to
apply  directly  for  phase-two  funding.  Number  five,  the  bill  allows
venture-capital  backed  small  businesses  to  apply  for  awards  and
defines  eligibility  requirements.  Number  six,  the  bill  expands  re-
quirements  on  agency  databases  of  award  recipients  and  also  re-
quires inter-operability and accessibility between agency databases,
and  this  will  permit  improved  oversight  by  the  agencies  and  by
Congress, on how on the agencies and how the programs are oper-
ating. Number seven, the bill allows for no more than three percent
of  program  funds  to  be  used  for  administrative  costs.  Currently,
agencies  pay  for  administration  of  SBIR,  taking  funds  from  other
agency  programs,  and  naturally,  they  must  try  to  administer  the
program  as  cheaply  as  possible.  This  results  in  little  oversight  of
the  program,  with  a  focus  on  simply  obligating  all  of  the  funds.
That is not the type of management we want for an over $2 billion
program. At our hearing, it was agreed that allowing some admin-
istrative costs would help improve the quality and oversight of the
program.  And  finally,  the  bill  establishes  an  interagency  com-
mittee,  co-chaired  by  the  Director  of  OSTP  and  the  Director  of
NIST, to report to Congress on both practices for commercialization
of SBIR- and STTR-funded research.

In closing, this subcommittee has been a leader in passing legis-
lation  that  advances  our  innovation  agenda.  Today,  we  continue
our  leadership  by  reauthorizing  SBIR  and  STTR.  I  urge  my  col-
leagues to support the legislation, and I now recognize Dr. Gingrey
to present his opening remarks.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN DAVID WU

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  the  Subcommittee  markup  of  H.R.  5789,  the
Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2008. This bill reauthorizes two programs
critical  to  the  competitiveness  of  the  U.S.,  the  Small  Business  Innovative  Research
Program  (SBIR)  and  the  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  Research  Program
(STTR).

322

Our  committee  has  been  working  on  this  bill  for  some  time,  and  I  want  to  thank
my  Ranking  Member  Dr.  Gingrey  and  all  the  Members  of  the  Committee  for  con-
tinuing our work in crafting legislation that supports innovation.

In today’s economy, small business is where innovation happens. The Science and
Technology Committee, especially the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee, in-
tends  to  promote  science  and  technology  research  that  drives  an  innovation-based
economy.

SBIR and STTR are key components of our innovation agenda. At more than $2.3
billion  per  year,  SBIR  and  STTR  comprise  the  largest  source  of  federal  support  for
technological  innovation  in  the  private  sector.  These  funds  help  companies  with  in-
novative ideas bring their products to market.

However,  these  programs  originated  more  than  20  years  ago.  Much  has  changed
since then; these programs need to be restructured to reflect the current global inno-
vation environment.

The  Technology  and  Innovation  Subcommittee  held  hearings  last  year  on  the
SBIR  and  STTR  programs  to  analyze  their  place  in  an  innovation  agenda  for  the
21st  century.  Our  witnesses  made  many  suggestions  on  how  the  SBIR  and  STTR
programs could be strengthened.

During hearings for the reauthorization of the National Nanotechnology Initiative
(NNI),  witnesses  said  that  programs  like  SBIR  and  STTR  are  necessary  if  the  U.S.
is  going  to  capture  the  economic  benefits  of  our 
in
nanotechnology research.

Outside  groups  agree—SBIR  and  STTR  are  important  to  commercializing  prod-

federal 

investment 

ucts that begin with investments in basic research.

Members  of  this  committee  agree  on  the  importance  of  our  high-tech  entrepre-
neurial  companies  in  creating  new  technologies.  These  are  exactly  the  companies
targeted  by  SBIR.  STTR  links  those  small  high-tech  companies  with  our  univer-
sities, which are a key cradle of new high-tech ideas.

Based upon this subcommittee’s hearings H.R. 5798 does the following:

1. Reauthorizes the SBIR & STTR programs thru 2010. This will put both pro-
grams on the same reauthorization cycle. In addition, the authorization time
frame will give Congress time to examine how well both programs are work-
ing to better focus on innovation.

2. For any federal agency which spends more than $100 million in intra- or ex-
tramural  research  per  year,  the  set  aside  increases  to  3.0  percent  for  SBIR
and to 0.6 percent for STTR. This emphasizes the importance we place upon
SBIR and STTR as part of the innovation agenda.

3. Increases  the  Phase  I  awards  from  $100,000  to  $300,000  and  Phase  II
awards  from  $750,000  to  $2.2  million  to  better  reflect  the  actual  costs  of
doing high-tech research;

4. Increases  the  flexibility  of  the  SBIR  program  by  allowing  cross-agency

awards and allowing applicants to apply directly for Phase II funding;

5. Allows  venture  capital-backed  small  businesses  to  apply  for  awards  and  de-

fines eligibility requirements;

6. Expands requirements on agency databases of award recipients. This section
also  requires  inter-operability  and  accessibility  between  agency  databases.
This will allow for improved oversight by Congress on how agencies actually
operate SBIR programs.

7. Establishes  an  Interagency  Committee  co-chaired  by  the  Director  of  OSTP
and the Director of NIST to report to Congress on the best practices for com-
mercialization of SBIR- and STTR-funded research.

In  closing,  this  subcommittee  has  been  a  leader  in  passing  legislation  that  ad-
vances  our  innovation  agenda.  Today  we  continue  our  leadership  by  reauthorizing
SBIR and STTR. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. GINGREY. Chairman Wu, I am pleased that this markup has
been  called  today  to  look  at  the  important  issue  of  reauthorizing
both  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  grant  program,  and
the Small Business Technology Transfer Program, STTR.

These  are  both  grant  programs  that  have  been  effective  in  pro-
viding government assistance to small businesses to help more peo-
ple  in  our  country  achieve  the  American  dream.  However,  Mr.
Chairman, I do have to express concerns with the process, the leg-
islative process, by which this bill has been conducted. I appreciate

the Majority’s willingness to hold hearing on this important matter,
like  we  did  last  summer,  but  I  do  find  it  troubling  that  the  final
text of the Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2008 was only
made  available  to  the  Minority  once  this  markup  was  scheduled,
late  last  week.  I  am  proud  to  say,  as  I  have  many  times  in  the
past,  that  this  committee  operates  in  a  very  bipartisan  way.  In
most  cases,  our  Minority  side  is  certainly  given  the  opportunity  to
provide its input to the bills before they are marked up at the Sub-
committee  level.  However,  I  find  it  unfortunate  that  that  biparti-
sanship was compromised, I think, on this bill, maybe for the sake
of  legislative  expediency.  Had  the  Minority  been  consulted  much
earlier,  and  had  we  been  given  a  better  notice  of  today’s  markup,
I believe—I truly believe that this legislation would be a reflection
of broad input from Members on both sides of the aisle.

With  that  said,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my

time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gingrey follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY

Chairman  Wu,  I  am  pleased  that  this  markup  has  been  called  today  to  look  at
the  important  issue  of  reauthorizing  both  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research
grant  program  and  the  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  program.  These  are
both grant programs that have been effective in providing government assistance to
small  businesses  to  help  more  people  in  our  country  achieve  the  American  Dream.
However, Mr. Chairman, I have to express my concerns with the legislative proc-
ess  by  which  this  bill  has  been  conducted.  I  appreciate  the  Majority’s  willingness
to hold hearings on this important matter last summer, but I find it troubling that
the  final  text  of  the  Science  and  Technology  Innovation  Act  of  2008  was  only  made
available to the Minority once this markup was scheduled late last week.

I am proud to say that this committee operates in a very bipartisan way. In most
cases,  the  Minority  is  given  the  opportunity  to  provide  its  input  to  the  bill  before
it  is  marked  up  at  the  Subcommittee  level.  However,  it  is  unfortunate  that  the  bi-
partisanship  was  compromised  on  this  bill  for  the  sake  of  legislative  expediency.
Had  the  Minority  been  consulted  much  earlier  and  been  given  better  notice  of  to-
day’s  markup,  I  believe  that  this  legislation  would  be  a  reflection  of  broad  input
from Members on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman WU. And I thank the gentleman, and I understand the
gentleman’s concern about the pace of these proceedings, and I per-
sonally apologize for any sense of rush on this bill. And quite hon-
estly,  it  was  our  intent,  I  think,  by  staff  on  both  sides,  to  markup
this  bill  just  a  little  ways  down  the  pike.  But  I  do  believe  that  a
copy of the bill, which is substantially unchanged from today’s bill,
was  given  to  both  the  Majority  and  Minority  side  around  the  mid-
dle  of  March,  but  it  was  the  expectation  of  both  sides  that  this
markup  would  occur  a  little  bit  later  than  this,  and  due  to  cir-
cumstances  beyond  this  Chairman’s  control,  the  markup  is  occur-
ring today.

Mr. GINGREY. Chairman, if you would yield to me for a question.
Chairman WU. Yes, I would be happy to yield.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Well,  that  being  said,  is  it  the  intention  that  this
bill  will  be  marked  up  in  the  Full  Committee  after  we  get  done
with the markup today in Subcommittee?

Chairman  WU.  This  subcommittee  will  markup  the  legislation.
The  full  Small  Business  Committee,  which  traditionally  has
marked  up  first,  will  markup  parallel  legislation  tomorrow,  and

324

then we will be bringing those bills together and bringing the legis-
lation to the Floor.

Mr.  GINGREY.  If  the  Chairman  will  yield  for  just  an  additional

question?

Chairman WU. I would be happy to yield.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Is  it  not  true,  though,  that  that  is  not  what  we
would normally consider regular order, regular order being a mark-
up at a Subcommittee level, and then pending approval, a markup
by  the  Full  Committee.  I  would  assume  that  is  what  is  happening
in the Small Business Committee, and I just wonder why they are
swaying away from regular order in that regard.

Chairman WU. Reclaiming my time, my understanding, although
I  am  not  intimately  familiar  with  their  proceedings,  my  under-
standing  is  that  the  Small  Business  Committee  is  not  having  a
Subcommittee markup. They are having a Full Committee markup.
Now,  prior  to  this  date,  at  least  in  this  Congress,  we  have,  as  far
as  I  know,  consistently  moved  legislation  from  Subcommittee  to
Full Committee and then to the Floor. There may have been an ex-
ception  to  that  during  the  100  days  agenda,  but  I  am  working  off
recollection, and I just don’t know if it is 100 percent or not.

Mr. GINGREY. If the Chairman will yield?
Chairman WU. I would be happy to yield.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  appreciate  very  much  that
explanation.  How  do  you  foresee  these  bills  being  put  together  be-
fore they go to the Floor?

Chairman  WU.  I  think  that  the  two  committees,  the  bills,  as
marked-up by this subcommittee, and the bill as marked-up by the
full  Small  Business  Committee,  will  be  substantially  similar.  That
is  not  to  preclude  the  possibility  that  there  may  be  managers
amendments  or  other  changes  between  there  and  the  Rules  Com-
mittee and the Floor.

Mr. EHLERS. Will the gentleman yield?
Chairman WU. I would be happy to yield.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Just  to  comment—and
nothing I say should be construed as criticism of you or the Chair-
man  of  the  Full  Committee  or  the  majority  party,  but  I  am  dis-
turbed  by  the  process  and  largely  because  this,  once  again,  is  a
case  where  the  Science  Committee  is  getting  stomped  upon  by  an-
other  committee  with  which  it  shares  jurisdiction.  We  are  equal
partners in this particular topic, the SBIR. SBA runs the program,
but  we  are  supposed  to  monitor  the  science  related  to  it,  and  we,
by  the  extreme  rush  with  which  the  other  committee  is  handling
this, without giving us adequate time to deal with it, with suddenly
going  to  Full  Committee,  reporting  it  out  to  the  Floor.  That  does
not give us an opportunity to really work our will on this. We have
had  the  hearings.  We  have  had  a  couple  of  hearings,  over  two
years, on this issue, waiting for the other committee of jurisdiction
to  act,  and  now  finally  they  are  acting,  and  after  two  years  of  did-
dling around, suddenly it has to be done in two days and go to the
Floor  immediately.  I  object  to  that  procedure,  partially  because  I
think it really endangers the jurisdiction of this committee. This is
not  the  first  time  that  other  committees  have  treated  us  shabbily.
I think we really have to, as the youngest committee here, and one
that  did  not  get  adequate  jurisdiction  when  it  was  originally  cre-

325

ated—obviously,  NIH  should  be  in  this  committee,  but  it  isn’t  be-
cause another committee refused to give it up. But we see this over
and over, and the only way we are going to get the subjects before
this committee that really belong before this committee is to dig in
our heels and say enough. We are going to claim full responsibility
and  full  opportunity  in  this  committee  as  well.  So  as  I  say,  this  is
not a criticism of you or the Majority in any sense. It is a criticism
of  the  institution,  perhaps,  on  behalf  of  this  committee,  that  we
really  have  to  make  it  clear  we  are  here  to  stay.  We  are  going  to
act with force on all issues that come before, and above all, I would
hope that the Majority would insist that when this bill goes to the
Floor, it goes after proceeding through the Rules Committee so that
we have the opportunity to present amendments there. If after this
charade that we are going through now it goes directly to the Floor
on  a  suspension,  we  will  not  have  had  any  opportunity  to  input,
and  I  will  certainly  raise  strong  objections  to  that.  And  I  vow  to
get  leaders  of  the  Minority  party  to  also  raise  a  fuss  about  it,  lest
there  be  an  opportunity  to  debate  these  issues  on  the  Floor,  at
least,  if  we  don’t  have  a  chance  to  work  on  them  with  the  other
committee of jurisdiction.

So as you know, I am an even-tempered person. I don’t get angry
often,  but  this  is  a  case  where  I  think  we  have  to  fight  together.
We  have  to  fight  for  the  jurisdiction  of  this  committee  and  make
it  known  that  we  do  not  want  this  sort  of  thing.  Thank  you  very
much for yielding.

Chairman  WU.  I  thank  the  gentleman  for  his  comments,  in  re-
claiming  my  time.  Without  commenting  on  the  scheduling  of  any
other  committee,  it  is  precisely  because  I  believe  very  strongly  in
the  input  of  the  Subcommittee,  and  preferably  the  whole  Com-
mittee,  that  we  are  holding  this  markup  today  so  that  Members
can  have  as  much  opportunity  as  possible  to  consider  the  bill,  to
propose amendments, and the gentleman certainly has my full sup-
port  to  take  this  bill  to  the  Floor  under  a  rule,  rather  than  under
suspension of the rules.

Chairman WU. I would be happy to yield.
Mr.  GINGREY.  The  gentleman  from  Michigan  said  he  is  an  even-
tempered  man,  and  the  gentleman  from  Georgia  is  also  even-tem-
pered; mad all of the time. But no, truly, in the spirit of bipartisan-
ship,  which  especially  prevails  on  this  subcommittee,  Mr.  Chair-
man,  we  respect  you  for  that,  a  great  wake-up  call  not  only  would
be  to  bring  this  bill  to  the  Floor  under  a  rule,  but  also  encourage
you,  Mr.  Subcommittee  Chairman,  to  ask  our  Full  Committee
Chairman and maybe also Chairman Velazquez of the Small Busi-
ness  Committee,  to  encourage  the  Rules  Committee  to  make  this
open  rule.  And  that  would  be,  I  think,  a  very  great  statement  for
bipartisanship,  and  we  would  hope  that  you  would  do  that  for  us.
Chairman WU. Reclaiming my time, I certainly enjoy and encour-
age and value the bipartisanship of this subcommittee and the Full
Committee. I will strongly encourage bringing this bill under a rule

Mr.  EHLERS.  And  I  do  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing,  and

to the Floor. I am afraid that what kind of rule it is under is a lit-
tle bit above my pay-grade, and I thank the gentleman for his com-
ments.  We  do  have  a  set  of  Floor  votes,  which  have  been  called,
and  there  are  two  minutes  left  to  vote,  and  under  those  cir-
cumstances, I would like to recess this markup until after the Floor
votes, and those Floor votes will take probably somewhere between
30 and 60 minutes, and we will reconvene, very promptly after the
Floor votes.
[Recess.]
Chairman  WU.  The  Committee  is  reconvened.  Without  objection,
any  Members  who  have  opening  statements  may  place  their  state-
ments in the record at this point.

I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  bill  is  considered  read  and
open  to  amendment  at  any  point,  and  that  Members  proceed  with
the  amendments  in  the  order  of  the  roster.  Without  objection,  so
ordered.

The  first  amendment  on  the  roster  is  an  amendment  offered  by
the  gentleman  from  Michigan,  Dr.  Ehlers.  Dr.  Ehlers,  are  you
ready to proceed with your amendment?
The Clerk will report the amendment.
The CLERK. Amendment to H.R. 5789.
Chairman  WU.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with  the

reading. Without objection, so ordered.

Dr. Ehlers, you are recognized for five minutes.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  This  is  a  very  straight-
forward  amendment.  It  would  strike  sections  201  and  202,  which
provide  for  an  increase  in  the  agencies  set  aside  to  three  percent,
when it is currently 2.5 percent, for SBIR, and .06 percent, up from
the current .03 percent, for the STTR.

My  concern  about  this  is,  first  of  all,  it  is  a  substantial  increase
in  the  set-aside  in  both  cases.  Secondly,  as  we  all  know,  when  the
Omnibus Bill was passed last fall, it did major damage to the fund-
ing for the science organizations of the federal government, particu-
larly  the  National  Science  Foundation,  NIST,  Department  of  En-
ergy,  and  several  other  agencies.  And  it  seems  to  me  particularly
strange  that  when  we  have  either  reduced  or  given  very  small  in-
creases  for  the  basic  research,  which  this  country  desperately
needs, and which is what the COMPETES Act was all about, which
this  committee  worked  on  so  hard  for  so  long,  it  seems  strange  to
me  that  when  the  funding  is  low,  that  we  would  increase  the  set-
aside  and  do  even  greater  damage  to  a  agencies  such  as  the  Na-
tional  Science  Foundation,  et  cetera.  It  is  just—even  aside  from
whether  or  not  they  should  have  the  increase,  which  we  can  cer-
tainly  debate,  this  is  obviously  the  wrong  time  to  do  it,  and  I  be-
lieve  it  will  hurt  the  science  agencies  of  the  Federal  Government
which are already really struggling. The Department of Energy, for
example, is laying off several hundred people as a result of the cuts
they  received  in  the  Omnibus  Bill,  so  I  strongly  support  this
amendment,  and  I  hope  we  will  pass  it.  We  can  consider  changing
the set-aside at some future date, once we properly restore funding
to the science agencies I mentioned.

I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman WU. Thank you, Doctor. Anyone seeking time?

327

The  Chair  recognizes  himself.  Regrettably,  I  oppose  this  amend-
ment.  The  increase  to  three  percent  would  be  more  than  offset  by
the R&D increases authorized in the America COMPETES Act, and
if  the  authorization  levels  are  met  by  the  appropriators  of  the  in-
crease  to  three  percent,  it  will  not  decrease  the  amount  of  funds
available for pure research.

Additionally,  at  our  hearings,  there  is  uniform  support  for  in-
creasing  the  size  of  awards,  at  a  minimum,  to  adjust  for  inflation.
However,  I  think  that  many  folks  are  concerned  that  if  we  do  in-
crease  the  size  of  awards,  that  there  will  be  fewer  awards,  so  we
do  need  to  increase  the  set-aside,  and  on  that  basis,  I  support  the
gentleman’s  sentiment  to  increase  the  amount  of  money  available
to  research,  but  I  think  three  percent  is  a  reasonable  number  for
commercialization of the products, of the fruits of that research, to
turn the research into products and jobs.

Any other comment on the amendment?
Mr. EHLERS. Will the gentleman yield?
Chairman WU. I would be happy to yield.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you  for  yielding.  I  just  would  like  to  com-
ment  that—and  I  can  see  the  handwriting  on  the  wall  here—but
I  think  this  is  another  good  argument  for  taking  this  to  the  Floor
under  a  rule  so  that  we  will  have  an  opportunity  to  offer  these
amendments  there,  primarily  because  this  is  not  going  to  Full
Committee, and so most of the Science Committee will not have an
opportunity  to  debate  this  amendment  unless  we  do  have  the  op-
portunity to offer amendments on the Floor.

Chairman  WU.  Reclaiming  my  time,  as  the  gentleman  knows,  I
support  the  gentleman’s  sentiment  about  bringing  this  legislation
to the Floor under a rule.

Is there any further discussion of the amendment?
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman  WU.  The  Chairman  of  the  Full  Committee  is  recog-

nized for five minutes.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  he  doesn’t  need  that  long,  but  let  me
just say that Dr. Ehlers has a reputation for not bringing frivolous
got-you  amendments  to  this  committee,  and  this  is  a  thoughtful—
there can be disagreements, but no one would disagree that his ap-
proach  here—it  is  my  understanding,  and  I  am  not  guaranteeing
anything—but  it  is  my  understanding  that  there  is  an  interest  in
bringing  this  bill  to  the  Floor  with  a  rule.  I  will  communicate,
again  for  whatever  that  is  worth,  to  the  Rules  Committee  that  I
think it is appropriate. I may not support it. I probably won’t sup-
port  it,  because  there  has  been  a  delicate  balance  reached  in  mak-
ing  this,  with  a  consultation,  both  with  the  Minority  as  well  as
with  the  Small  Business,  but  there  can  be  no  question  that  this  is
a  worthwhile  amendment,  and  I  will,  again,  ask—I  used  to  be  on
the  Rules  Committee,  but  I  am  not  any  longer,  so  all  I  can  do  is
ask.

Mr. EHLERS. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Chairman  WU.  Is  there  any  further  discussion  of  the  amend-

And  if  not,  the  vote  occurs  on  the  amendment.  All  in  favor  say

Chairman  WU.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with  the

reading. Without objection, so ordered.

I  recognize  the  Ranking  Member,  Dr.  Gingrey,  for  five  minutes

to explain his amendment.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  This  amendment  that
I am offering to H.R. 5789 will provide a practical way to maintain
the integrity of SBIR and STTR programs.

In  the  current  form,  the  bill  allows  for  companies  to  apply  di-
rectly for a Phase II grant, and we know those grants have a max-
imum award, now, of $2.2 million. They can do this without having
received a Phase I grant. I find this practice to be somewhat prob-
lematic  because  it  allows  companies  to  conduct  Phase  I  process  on
private funds before approaching the Federal Government for SBIR
or  STTR  assistance  in  Phase  II.  Ostensibly,  if  a  company  has  the
ability  to  use  private  funds  for  Phase  I,  then  it  should  be  able  to
continue  to  Phase  II  on  private  funds.  I  believe  that  the  current
language  regarding  this  within  H.R.  5789  only  provides  incentives
to  companies  that  can  already  afford  to  cultivate  R&D  initiatives
to  come  to  the  Federal  Government  when  they  should  not  do  so.
This practice has the potential of reducing the opportunity for com-
panies  that  truly  need  the  assistance  to  utilize  SBIR  and  STTR
programs the way that they are intended.

I  am  offering  this  amendment  to  specifically  address  this  issue
by  striking  the  language  that  provides  for  bypassing  Phase  I
grants.  Therefore,  the  bill  would  require  that  in  order  for  a  com-
pany to be eligible for a Phase II grant, it would first have to have
been  a  recipient  of  a  Phase  I  grant.  I  believe  that  adopting  this
amendment  will  strengthen  the  SBIR  and  STTR  programs  so  that
they can fulfill the mission, that of providing small-business assist-
ance to entrepreneurs that are in the most need of financial assist-
ance from the Federal Government.

I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and Mr. Chair-

man, with that, I will yield back the balance of my time.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gingrey follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE PHIL GINGREY

Mr.  Chairman,  this  second  amendment  that  I  am  offering  to  H.R.  5789  will  pro-
vide yet another practical way to maintain the integrity of the SBIR and the STTR
programs.

In  its  current  form,  H.R.  5789  allows  for  companies  to  apply  directly  for  a  Phase
II  grant  that  has  a  maximum  award  of  $2.2  million,  without  having  received  a
Phase  I  grant.  I  find  this  practice  to  be  somewhat  problematic  because  it  allows
companies  to  conduct  the  Phase  I  process  on  private  funds  before  approaching  the
federal government for SBIR or STTR assistance in Phase II.

Ostensibly,  if  a  company  has  the  ability  to  use  private  funds  for  Phase  I,  then
it should be able to continue to Phase II on private funds. I believe that the current
language regarding this within H.R. 5789 only provides incentives to companies that
can  already  afford  to  cultivate  R&D  initiatives  to  come  to  the  Federal  Government
when  they  should  not  do  so.  This  practice  has  the  potential  of  reducing  the  oppor-
tunity  for  companies  that  truly  need  the  assistance  to  utilize  the  SBIR  and  STTR
programs the way they are intended.

I  am  offering  this  amendment  to  specifically  address  this  issue  by  striking  the
language  that  provides  for  bypassing  Phase  I  grants.  Therefore,  the  bill  would  re-
quire  that  in  order  for  a  company  to  be  eligible  for  a  Phase  II  grant,  it  would  first
have to have been the recipient of a Phase I grant.

I believe that adopting this amendment will strengthen the SBIR and STTR pro-
grams  so  that  they  can  fulfill  the  mission  of  providing  small  business  assistance  to
entrepreneurs  that  are  in  the  most  need  of  financial  assistance  from  the  Federal
Government.

ance of my time.

Chairman  WU.  I  thank  the  gentleman,  and  again,  regrettably,  I
must  oppose  the  amendment,  because  if  a  small  business  has  al-
ready done the preliminary work under Phase I, I do not think that
the  business  should  be  penalized  for  having  spent  its  own  money,
and  then  coming  to  the  Federal  Government  for  a  Phase  II  grant,
and  skipping  Phase  I.  The  amounts  are  dramatically  different.  A
Phase  I  grant,  under  the  proposed  legislation,  is  for  $300,000,  and
a  company  that  can  afford  $300,000  in  development  may  not  be
able to afford the new amount in Phase II of $2.2 million.

The  agencies  which  testified  to  this  subcommittee  stated  that  it
would enhance SBIR and STTR programs if a small business could
apply  directly  for  a  Phase  II  award,  and  I  must  add  that  this  is
a  not  a  mandatory  program.  This  is  an  option  to  the  agencies  to
permit skipping Phase I, if they choose to do so.

Does anyone else seek recognition on the amendment?
If  not,  then  the  vote  occurs  on  the  amendment.  All  in  favor,  say
aye.  Those  opposed,  say  no.  In  the  opinion  of  the  Chair,  the  nos
have it, and the amendment is not agreed to.

It is now in order to consider the third amendment on the roster,
and  it  is  also  offered  by  the  gentleman  from  Georgia,  Dr.  Gingrey.
Dr. Gingrey, are you ready to proceed with your amendment?

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  yes,  I  have  an  amendment  at  the

desk.

Chairman  WU.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with  the

reading, and without objection, so ordered.

I  recognize  the  gentleman  from  Georgia  for  five  minutes  to  ex-

plain his amendment.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  Again,  I  brought  forth
what  I  believe  is  a  very  common  sense  and  practical  amendment
to ensure that small business innovation and research grants actu-
ally go to small business applicants.

Put simply, venture capital is important to small business initia-
tives because it provides needed financial assistance and credibility
to the ideas and products that possess the potential to be commer-
cialized.  However,  because  these  grants  are  intended  for  small
business  research  and  development,  we  must  ensure  that  venture
capital does not represent a majority of the financial interest with-
in an SBIR application. The manner in which this bill is currently
written  only  limits  a  single  venture  capital  firm  from  owning  49
percent of the interest of the company applying for the SBIR grant.
This leaves open the possibility that more than one venture capital
firm  could  own  in  the  aggregate  a  majority  of  financial  interest
within the company. I mean an example, in the aggregate, all own-
ing  less  than  49  percent,  they  could  own  99  percent  of  the  com-
pany, if you had two or more, as an example.

I  have  just  given  that  worst-case  scenario,  so  Mr.  Chairman,  I
believe that this really goes against the spirit of the SBIR program,
and I had some language that I wanted to read from the report lan-
guage of the original bill, back in 1982, and it says ‘‘the recognition

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:28 Jan 05, 2009 Jkt 037729 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\110MAR~1\37729\37729A.TXT SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

331

of  the  ability  of  the  small  firm  to  develop  and  commercialize  new
technologies  coupled  with  the  apparently  declining  rate  of  innova-
tion  and  productivity  in  United  States  industries  as  a  whole  have
led  to  widespread  interest  in  the  problems  of  the  small  business
community  and  the  amount  of  federal  R&D  funding  which  is  flow-
ing  into  this  sector.’’  And  then  it  goes  on  to  say  under  subpara-
graph  B,  state  of  small  business  participation  in  federal  R&D,  ‘‘a
purpose  of  the  bill  is  to  increase  the  utilization  of  small  business
in federal research and development. Some have argued that a set-
aside  of  federal  R&D  funds  for  small  business  is  justified  on  the
basis  that  small  firms  have  been  demonstrably  innovative  and  yet
receive a small share of the federal R&D budget. During debate on
the  legislation,  frequent  reference  have  been  made  to  the  small
business share of federal R&D.’’

Mr.  Chairman,  again,  I  believe  that  that  hopefully  reflects  the
original intent of the bill, and that what we are doing in regard to
venture  capitalists  goes  against  the  spirit  of  the  SBIR  program.
Reading further from that report language, it says, specifically, the
legislation  is  also  intended  to  ‘‘provide  seed  capital  to  small,  high-
technology  firms  at  the  early  high-risk  stage  of  initial  concept  de-
velopment.’’ Funds provided under—well, that was the name of the
bill  back  then.  They  go  on  to  elaborate  on  that  point.  So  the  pro-
gram  is  designed  to  provide  assistance  to  a  small  business  that
may  have  an  idea  that  can  be  considered  a  diamond  in  the  rough,
if  you  will,  without  necessarily  having  the  financial  backing  to
move  its  promising  idea  towards  commercialization  and  maybe
even the interest of venture capitalists at the outset.

My  amendment  would  assure  that  we  continue  to  help  out  the
true  small  business  entrepreneurs  by  simply  limiting  the  total
amount  of  venture  capital  investment  in  the  company  of  a  SBIR
application to 49 percent of their financial interest. With the adop-
tion  of  this  amendment,  this  legislation  will  acknowledge  the  im-
portance  of  the  influence  that  venture  capital  can  play  in  small
business research and development, while still maintaining the in-
tegrity of the SBIR program.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  urge  all  of  my  colleagues  on  the  Subcommittee
to  support  this  amendment,  and  I  yield  back  the  balance  of  my
time.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  believe  that  this  goes  against  the  spirit  of  the  SBIR  program.
The  program  is  designed  to  provide  assistance  to  a  small  business  that  may  have
an  idea  that  can  be  considered  a  diamond  in  the  rough,  without  necessarily  having
the financial backing to move its promising idea toward commercialization.

My amendment would ensure that we continue to help out the true small business

the  company  of  an  SBIR  applicant  to  49  percent  of  the  financial  interest.  With  the
adoption of this amendment, this legislation will acknowledge the importance of the
influence that venture capital can play in small business research and development
while maintaining the integrity of the SBIR program.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  urge  all  of  my  colleagues  on  the  Subcommittee  to  support  this

amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.

Chairman WU. I thank the gentleman.
Chairman  GORDON.  If  the  Chairman  would  yield?  Let  me  just
say  that  although  Dr.  Gingrey  is  not  quite  as  pure  as  Dr.  Ehlers,
I  recognize  this  is  not  a  frivolous  amendment  by  any  means  and
that it is offered in good spirit. I have some concerns about basing
the amendment on the 1982 report, but I know that, again, this is
legitimate.

I want to also point out that I am uncomfortable with this proce-
dure.  I  think,  you  know,  we  have  never  taken  this—although  in
previous  Congresses,  it  has  been  not  uncommon  to  be,  what  you
might say, out of regular order, we have not done that in this Con-
gress. I think this is somewhat different in the fact that the minor-
ity received the draft on March 19. There were only minor changes,
of which one was a—one of the minority suggestions which was in-
corporated  into  it.  We  got  into  extensive  deliberations  with  the
Small  Business,  much  of  which  was,  as  Dr.  Ehlers  always  rec-
ommends,  maintaining  our  jurisdiction  and  trying  to  get  it  right.
And so for that reason, we are going to be going, you know, to the
Floor next week. There is not time to have a Full Committee mark-
up.  But  I  am  once  again,  going  to  recommend  to  the  Rules  Com-
mittee  that  both  of  Dr.  Gingrey’s  amendments  be  made  in  order,
because  I  think  it  is  appropriate  that  we  have  a  more  full  discus-
sion on this.

Again,  with  that  said,  I  will  yield  back  the  balance  of  my  time.
Chairman  WU.  If  there  are  no  other  speakers,  I  must  again  re-

grettably oppose the amendment.

I must say that from the inception of SBIR until an Administra-
tive  Law  Judge  decision,  there  was  no  restriction  on  participation
of venture capital in SBIR applicants, and in my view, the Admin-
istrative Law Judge got the law wrong in 2003, in interpreting the
term  ‘‘American  person.’’  And  I  view  that  as  a  domestic  ownership
requirement,  but  the  ALJ  said  that  the  term  ‘‘person’’  did  not  in-
clude  non-real  person  entities,  and  that  is  a  determination  that
lawyers  make  as  a  standard  item  of  statutory  interpretation,  so
after that, in my view, erroneous interpretation, venture capitalists
have  not  been  permitted  to  own  a  majority  stake  in  SBIR  appli-
cants,  and  this  bill,  in  essence,  partially,  reverses  that  decision,
and it is a carefully crafted partial reversal of that decision.

No  single  venture  capitalist  may  own  a  majority  share  of  an
SBIR  applicant,  but  a  consortium  of  venture  capitalists  may  own
any  particular  percentage  of  an  applicant,  and  it  is  precisely  those
applicants  which  are  potentially  in  a  weaker  negotiating  position
which  may  have  had  to  give  up  a  large  share  of  their  equity  in
order  to  get  the  application  that  would  be  hurt  by  a  restriction  on

333

SBIR applications by those entities which have had to give up more
than  50  percent  of  their  ownership  in  order  to  get  financed  by  a
venture capitalist.

And just one further point is that after this ALJ decision restrict-
ing  the  type  of  applicants  eligible  for  SBIR  grants,  the  National
Cancer  Institute  noted  a  drop-off  in  applications  and  potentially  a
decrease  in  the  quality  of  the  applicants.  Frequently,  the  venture
capitalists  are  backing  folks  who  have  a  better  mousetrap,  and  a
lot  of  those  folks  have  become  ineligible  to  apply  for  venture  cap-
ital,  so  for  all  of  those  reasons,  I  am  going  to  oppose  the  motion.

Mr. EHLERS. I move to strike the last word.
Chairman WU. The gentleman is recognized for five minutes.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is really a difficult
issue,  and  something  that  we  have  discussed  in  this  committee
quite  a  few  times,  and  I  guess  my  concern  is  the  same  as  before
that  another  committee  has  made  this  decision  and  we  are  simply
accepting  it.  We  have  had  some  very  good  discussions  and  good
ideas  that  have  emerged,  and  this  is,  I  think,  a  sort  of  brute-force
approach, I think, to really resolve the problem properly and fairly
for  all  parties,  we  need  more  consideration,  more  discussion,  and
try  to  come  up  with  an  approach  that  really  accomplishes—or  ac-
commodates  all  of  the  parties  involved,  and  so  I  am  hesitant  to—
well,  I  certainly  support  the  amendment,  just  because  that  will
help us approach it better in further discussion, but I think—I rec-
ognize  there  is  the  possibility  that  we  need  some  change  here,  but
why this sudden dramatic change? And I would prefer that we did
it in a more deliberate manner and tried to come up with a solution
that really made more sense.

So  I  will  support  the  amendment  and  hope  that  we  can  debate

this on the Floor.

Chairman WU. If the gentleman would yield?
Mr. EHLERS. I would be happy to yield.
Chairman WU. In terms of any discussion with other committees,
I  would  just  like  to  point  out  that  it  was  this  committee  which
stood  up  for  the  ability  of  applicants  to  structure  their  capital
structure  any  which  way  that  they  wished  and  not  any  other  com-
mittee, and I yield back to the gentleman.

Mr. EHLERS. I will yield back. Thank you.
Chairman GORDON. If the Chairman would yield, just very quick-

ly.

Chairman WU. The gentleman is recognized for five minutes.
Chairman GORDON. Once again, the reason that—there should be
no  misunderstanding  that  the  reason  we  are  running  a  little  bit
late  is  that  the  Committee  staff  negotiated  hard  and  tough  and
wouldn’t let it come up next week until we got concessions from the
other committee in question.

Let me also point out that we have got to go through—hopefully,
this  will  pass  on  the  Floor,  and  hopefully  the  Senate  will  get  up
a  bill,  and  that  we  will  go  through  conference,  and  that  this  is  a
dialogue  that  will  continue,  because  we  want  the  best  bill  that  we
can get.

Chairman  WU.  Is  there  any  further  discussion  of  the  amend-

ment?

Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  don’t  need  five  min-
utes. Basically, I just wanted to, Mr. Chairman, for unanimous con-
sent  to  submit  a  couple  of  letters  in  support  of  both  amendments
for  the  record,  and  one  of  these,  Mr.  Chairman,  comes  from  the

it  is  a  letter  from  a  Steven  Preston,  the  Administrator  of  the  U.S.
Small  Business  Administration  in  support  of  the  amendment.  And
the other letter in support, Mr. Chairman, is from SBTC, the Small

Chairman WU. The Clerk will report the amendment.
The  CLERK.  Amendment  to  H.R.  5789,  offered  by  Mr.  Wilson  of

Ohio.

Chairman  WU.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  dispense  with  the

reading. Without objection, so ordered.

I  recognize  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  for  five  minutes  to  explain

his amendment.

Mr.  WILSON.  As  a  strong  supporter  of  small  business  innovation
research  and  small  business  technical  transfer  programs  which
serve  as  a  lifeline  for  many  small  businesses  and  innovative  busi-
nesses,  my  amendment  today  would  designate  nanotechnology-re-
lated  research  as  a  critical  technology  in  the  SBIR—excuse  me—
and STTR programs. This would allow companies to receive special
consideration  as  they  apply  for  federal  grants  for  their  work  in
nanotechnology.

Today,  nanotechnology  has  an  impact  on  all  sectors  of  our  econ-
omy,  and  the  work  of  nanotechnology  can  be  found  in  electronics
like  our  cell  phones  and  Blackberries,  in  our  cosmetics,  cars,  and
medical products. With nanotechnology playing such a fundamental
role  in  our  economy,  it  is  critical  that  the  U.S.  investment  in  this
industry continue to grow.

In  my  district,  at  Ohio  University,  such  research  is  being  done
daily. I recently heard from nanoscientists that if the research were
included in this way, it would help their projects to go from the lab
and  to  migrate  to  the  market.  The  inclusion  of  nanotechnology  re-
search  as  a  critical  technology  will  help  ensure  that  federal  agen-
cies  continue  to  assist  and  even  increase  their  support  for
nanotechnology companies in both SBIR and STTR programs.

I  encourage  all  of  my  colleagues  to  support  my  amendment  and
reauthorize  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  program.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Wilson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE WILSON

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to offer.
Thank you. I am here today as a strong supporter of the Small Business Innova-
tion  Research  (SBIR)  and  Small  Business  Technical  Transfer  (STTR)  programs—
which serve as a lifeline for many small and innovative businesses.

My  amendment  today  would  designate  nanotechnology-related  research  as  a  crit-
ical technology in the SBIR and STTR programs. This would allow companies to re-
ceive  special  consideration  as  they  apply  for  federal  grants  for  their  work  in
nanotechnology.  As  you  know  special  consideration  means  that  they’re  given  extra
weight throughout their application process.

Today, nanotechnology has an impact on all sectors of our economy. And the work
of  nanotechnology  can  be  found  in  electronics—like  our  cell  phones  and  black-
berries—in  out  cosmetics,  cars,  and  medical  products.  With  nanotechnology  playing
such  a  fundamental  role  in  our  economy—it  is  critical  that  U.S.  investment  in  this
industry continue to grow.

In  my  district,  at  Ohio  University  such  research  is  being  done.  I  recently  heard
from  some  nano-scientists  that  if  their  research  was  included  in  this  way,  it  would
help their projects in the lab migrate to the market.

The inclusion of nanotechnology research as a critical technology will help ensure
that  federal  agencies  continue  to  assist  and  even  increase  their  support  for
nanotechnology companies in both the SBIR and STTR programs.

I  encourage  all  of  my  colleagues  to  support  my  amendment  and  reauthorize  the

Small Business Innovation Research Program.

Thank you.
Chairman WU. I thank the gentleman.

Is  there  further  discussion  on  the  amendment?  If  not,  the  vote

occurs on the amendment.

Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman?
Chairman WU. The Ranking Member?
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  I  am  sorry.  I  was  a  lit-
tle  slow  responding  there.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  supportive  of
nanotechnology research and education initiatives, but I have some
concerns  about  this  particular  amendment.  As  I  read  the  amend-
ment,  the  SBIR  program  includes  nanotechnology  topics  in  its  list
of other priorities, alongside those from the Department of Defense
and  the  National  Critical  Technologies  Panel.  For  the  STTR  pro-
grams,  nanotechnology  endeavors  would  be  singled  out  as  a  cat-
egory  of  projects  that  could  receive  funding,  thereby  potentially
narrowing  the  scope  of  the  program,  so  I  am  concerned  that  the
language  for  these  two  programs,  and  especially  the  STTR,  would
carve  out  a  specific  benefit  for  nanotechnology  at  the  expense  of
other worthy endeavors.

It  is  very  important  to  point  out  that  under  the  current  law,
nanotechnology  initiatives  are  not  excluded  from  grant  consider-
ation.  They  compete  for  funding  with  other  research  and  develop-
ment  projects,  and  there  is  nothing  in  the  underlying  bill  that  de-
tracts from that reality. Nanotechnology research should be consid-
ered  for  grant  funding,  but  it  should  not,  I  don’t  think,  be  given
special consideration above other important topics.

Just  this  morning,  the  Full  Committee  held  a  hearing  reauthor-
izing  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative.  It  is  my  under-
standing  that  the  bill  being  drafted  will  incorporate  SBIR  and
STTR  programs,  and  certainly  I  look  forward  to  working  with  my
friend,  Mr.  Wilson,  the  gentleman,  to  ensure  that  nanotechnology
programs  are  advanced  across  many  agencies.  So  while  I  support
nanotechnology  research  and  development  initiatives,  I  have  con-
cerns  that  the  amendment  might  unduly  advance  those  concerns
over many other worthy fields of study, so I therefore would reluc-
tantly urge a no vote on this amendment.

Mr. SMITH. Very briefly, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members
of  the  Committee.  My  amendment  encourages  the  federal  agencies
to  give  priority  to  applications  so  as  to  increase  the  number  of
SBIR and STTR award recipients from rural areas.

Firms  located  in  a  relatively  small  number  of  states  have  been
successful in obtaining the awards through the program. According
to an ’06 government accountability study, about 70 percent of dol-
lars awarded went to firms in only 10 states. Let me also say that
the rural outreach program contained in these programs sunsetted.
It expired, and certainly, in the rural areas, we need to address the
brain-drain. I don’t want to expound, in the interest of time, on my
full  remarks  here,  but  certainly,  it  is  my  intention  to  bring  this  to
the attention of the Committee and urge the Committee to work to-
gether on the brain-drain and urge its adoption. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Smith follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ADRIAN SMITH

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,

My  amendment  would  encourage  federal  agencies  give  priority  to  applications  so
as  to  increase  the  number  of  SBIR  and  STTR  award  recipients  from  rural  areas.
Firms located in a relatively small number of states have been successful in obtain-
ing awards through the SBIR program. According to an April 2006 Government Ac-
countability Office study, about 70 percent of all SBIR awards and dollars awarded
went  to  firms  in  10  states.  This  leaves  many  qualified  firms  in  rural  areas,  such
as  high-tech  firms  in  the  Third  District  of  Nebraska,  at  a  disadvantage  when  it
comes to funding for innovative research and development.

In  order  to  assist  states  experiencing  difficulty  in  obtaining  these  awards,  the
2001  reauthorization  of  SBIR  encouraged  SBIR  agencies  to  do  a  better  job  of
partnering  with  states  via  the  creation  of  the  Rural  Outreach  Program.  The  Rural
Outreach  Program’s  primary  purpose  was  to  provide  federal  assistance  to  support
statewide  outreach  to  small  high-tech  business  located  in  25  states  that  are  under-
represented  in  SBIR  awards.  This  outreach  program  has  expired  and  rural  areas
are once again at a disadvantage in funding for developing commercial technologies.
Unfortunately, many rural states have seen a ‘brain drain’ in recent years. As the
depletion occurs, we lose our most vital economic asset to more populated areas. Re-
sponsible policy is needed to retain and grow our workforce to make our rural com-
munities more competitive in the modern economy.

Mr. Chairman, it is my intention today to bring this to the attention of the Com-
mittee  and  urge  the  Committee  to  continue  working  to  promote  outreach  and  par-
ticipation of rural areas in innovative research. I look forward to continuing consid-
eration and work on this important issue.

Chairman  WU.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  I  commend  him  for  his
amendment  and  support  rural  outreach.  Is  there  any  further  dis-
cussion of the amendment?

The Ranking Member?
Mr.  GINGREY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  want  to  support
the  efforts  of  Mr.  Smith.  Businesses  in  rural  areas  typically  have
a  harder  time  getting  capital,  even  when  they  have  a  very  good
concept,  because  of  the  limited  numbers  of  lending  institutions  or
venture  capital  firms,  so  this  amendment  does  not  require  that
agencies  pick  one  business  over  another.  It  simply  requires  them
to  consider  rural  businesses  and  how  they  are  represented  in  the
overall  agency  awards  to  increase  the  number  of  rural  businesses
receiving  grants.  I  think  it  is  a  good  amendment,  Mr.  Chairman,
and I urge my colleagues to support it.

will  say  aye.  All  those  opposed  will  say  no.  In  the  opinion  of  the
Chair, the ayes have it.

I recognize Dr. Gingrey to offer a motion.
Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Subcommittee  fa-
vorably report H.R. 5789, as amended, to the Full Committee. Fur-
thermore,  I  move  that  staff  be  instructed  to  prepare  the  Sub-
committee  legislative  report,  and  make  necessary  technical  and
confirming changes to the bill, as amended, in accordance with the
recommendations of the Subcommittee.

Chairman  WU.  The  question  is  on  the  motion  to  report  the  bill
favorably.  Those  in  favor  of  the  motion  will  signify  by  saying  aye.
Those  opposed,  say  no.  The  ayes  have  it,  and  the  bill  is  favorably
reported.

Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
I  want  to  take  this  moment  to  thank  staff  on  both  sides  for  their
very  hard  work  on  this  bill.  Bill  Behn,  who  was  a  detailee  to  this
committee, worked hard on this bill. The gentleman sitting next to

PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE  BUSINESS  MEETING
TO  CONSIDER  AUTHORIZATION  OF  A  SUB-
POENA  FOR  DOCUMENTS  RELATED  TO  THE
DEPARTMENT  OF  ENERGY’S  FUTUREGEN
PROJECT

THURSDAY,  JUNE  26,  2008

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT,

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,

Washington, DC.

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  call,  at  1:10  p.m.,  in  Room
2318  of  the  Rayburn  House  Office  Building,  Hon.  Brad  Miller
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.

Chairman  MILLER.  This  meeting  has  now  come  to  order.  It  will
be a very short meeting just to advise everyone here of the status.
We were prepared today to have the Committee consider issuing
a  subpoena  for  documents  pertaining  to  the  decision  to  end  the
FutureGen  project,  what  was  proposed  to  be  a  $1.8  billion  project
that  was  specifically  mentioned  in  three  different  State  of  the
Union addresses. That was somewhat precipitously canceled. Obvi-
ously  a  good  many  Members  of  Congress  were  more  than  a  little
curious  about  that  decision.  The  Subcommittee  staff  has  been  in-
volved in discussions with the Department of Energy and with the
White House for some considerable time now, had reviewed several
documents without taking copies, that was the understanding, and
determined that there were at least three documents that the Com-
mittee  really  did  need  to  see  to  understand  the  decision  for  this
committee,  for  the  Full  Committee  to  meet  probably  in  September
and consider the decision on FutureGen. I have within the last five
minutes been assured by the White House General Counsel’s Office
by Emmett Flood that the three specific documents they have now
reviewed  and  do  not  have  any  objection  to  providing  this  sub-
committee a copy of. Mr. Sensenbrenner, there was one other docu-
ment,  a  strategic  plan,  and  that  was  provided,  although  that  had
been promised some considerable time ago. Our subcommittee staff
just got that this morning within the last couple of hours. Mr. Sen-
senbrenner had also agreed to call the Department of Energy to en-
courage them to provide that document if it was not provided. The
document  that  we  have  gotten,  however,  is  a  draft  so  I  am  hoping
there will be some other discussions to make sure we got the right
version,  the  final  version.  But  based  upon  the  recent,  recent  being
within  the  last  20  minutes,  showing  of  good  faith,  we  will  accept,
for  now  at  least,  that  we  will  get  that  document  forthwith,  not
promptly but forthwith, and in fact, we have been promised all the
remaining  documents,  which  are  only,  you  know,  maybe  eight
pages  collectively,  by  tomorrow.  And  with  that  understanding,  we
will  assume  that  everyone  is  acting  in  good  faith  until  that  as-
sumption is disproven and——

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Will the Chairman yield?

Chairman  MILLER.  The  Chairman  yields  to  Mr.  Sensenbrenner.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Let me say that I think that the represen-
tation  that  the  Chairman  has  just  recounted  does  show  good  faith
on  the  part  of  the  White  House.  And  earlier  today  before  this  was
wrapped up, I offered to call Secretary Bodman up suggesting that
the  best  thing  to  do  is  to  allow  the  Committee  to  review  the  docu-
ments  that  were  in  question.  It  appears  now  that  that  offer  does
not need to be taken up, but it still is on the table.

Let  me  make  one  other  observation.  This  committee  has  not
issued  a  subpoena  since  1992.  I  think  we  have  gone  through  four
Chairs, including myself, that has not found a need to issue a sub-
poena  on  anything  within  the  oversight  jurisdiction  of  the  Com-
mittee  on  Science  and  Technology  and  its  predecessor  committees.
Should  we  issue  a  subpoena,  the  Administration  will  resist  it;  be-
cause they have resisted every other subpoena that has been issued
by  every  other  committee  in  this  Congress.  And  that  is  going  to
mean that we won’t have a chance to review this document during
the  life  of  this  Congress  because  an  attempt  to  enforce  the  sub-
poena  is  going  to  take  a  while  to  wind  its  way  through  the  courts.
So accepting the good faith on the part of the White House and the
good faith on the part of the Majority and its staff, I think that not
issuing or authorizing a subpoena at this time will say that we are
happy  to  meet  the  Administration  halfway.  So  far  there  is  good
faith  that  is  being  expressed  on  both  sides,  and  if  that  continues,
we  will  be  able  to  put  this  matter  to  rest.  I  thank  the  Chair  for
yielding.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  thank  you,  Mr.  Sensenbrenner,  and  pro-
vided that sweet reason does continue to prevail, perhaps we don’t
have to issue any subpoenas.

Does  anyone  else  wish  to  be  heard?  On  that  happy  conciliatory

note, the meeting is adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 1:14 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
