OVERSIGHT  OF  THE  NATIONAL  OCEANIC  AND 

ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION 

TUESDAY,  MAY  6,  2008 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON OCEANS, ATMOSPHERE, FISHERIES, 
AND COAST GUARD, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Maria  Cantwell, 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Good  morning.  The  Senate  Committee  on 
Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation,  Subcommittee  on  Oceans, 
Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard will come to order. 

We have an oversight hearing this morning on the National Oce-
anic  and  Atmospheric  Administration’s  budget,  and  we  will  hear 
from Admiral Lautenbacher shortly, but we are going to hear from 
my  colleague  Senator  Levin,  this  morning,  who  wants  to  testify 
about  legislation  that  is  also  on  the  docket  this  morning  as  it  re-
lates to marine sanctuaries. 

So, welcome, Senator Levin. Thank you for being here this morn-
ing to talk about the impacts and expansion of proposed legislation 
in  Michigan  in  regards  to  the  expansion  of  the  Thunder  Bay  Na-
tional Marine Sanctuary. 

So, welcome to the Committee. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 
I’d  like  to  welcome  you  all  to  today’s  oversight  hearing  of  the  National  Oceanic 
and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  its  Fiscal  Year  2009  budget,  and  issues 
facing the National Marine Sanctuaries program. 

Thank you, Admiral Lautenbacher, for being here today. 
I would like to start out today with an important note of congratulations. 
NOAA scientists are among the hundreds of researchers across the globe who con-

tributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 

Last  year,  the  IPCC  was  awarded  the  Nobel  Peace  Prize,  and  I  was  delighted  to 

see that many of NOAA’s scientists shared in this prestigious honor. 

I  have  here  a  list  of  the  NOAA  scientists  who  contributed  to  this  effort,  and  will 

I congratulate those individuals, and all those in NOAA who work so hard on this 

be including it in the record. 

vital topic. 
Budget Overview 

I’m happy to see that for the first time, the President’s budget request for NOAA 

actually exceeds last year’s Congressional appropriation. 

(1) 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

2 

I am concerned, though, that when we look deeper into the numbers, this budget 

is not the victory we would like it to be. 

NOAA’s fiscal year budget request for 2009 of $4.1 billion is 5 percent above Fis-

cal Year 2008 enacted levels of $3.9 billion. 

Almost this entire increase, though, goes toward funding the cost overruns in the 

troubled weather and climate satellite acquisition program. 

Unfortunately,  this  means  that  while  NOAA’s  top-line  budget  request  is  larger, 

the President is still proposing cuts for our Nation’s ocean programs. 
Troubled Satellites Program 

Admiral,  as  you  know,  there  has  been  a  lot  of  attention  of  late  to  the  troubles 

with NOAA’s satellite acquisition program. 

Our  aging  fleet  of  satellites  monitors  weather,  hurricanes,  the  climate,  and  the 

oceans, and desperately needs to be replaced. 

But the failures of this acquisition are impossible to ignore. 
While  cost  overruns  have  driven  the  price  of  the  National  Polar-orbiting  Oper-
ational  Environmental  Satellite  System  from  $6.5  billion  to  $12.5  billion,  the  lead 
contractor was awarded $123 million in ‘‘award fees.’’ 

This is inexcusable. 

U.S. Census 

I am also concerned about recent revelations over the 2010 Census. 
The Census Bureau’s handheld census computer acquisition has failed miserably. 
More than doubling in price, the computers are riddled with so many problems they 
will not be ready for use during the 2010 census. 

To help pay for these troubles, Secretary Gutie´rrez has asked Congress to transfer 
$27  million  from  NOAA  to  the  Census  Bureau  during  this  fiscal  year.  He  has  also 
indicated  he  will  need  to  move  up  to  $700  million  from  NOAA  and  other  agencies 
in Fiscal Year 2009 to make up for the Census shortfall. 

As these failures threaten to decimate NOAA’s budget, it is once again the oceans 

that will be asked to suffer. 
Cuts to Ocean Programs 

Because  of  the  financial  demands  of  the  satellite  acquisition  program  and  the 
Census Bureau, we are seeing cuts proposed for many of your most important agen-
cies. 

The National Ocean Service, the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and 

the National Marine Fisheries Service all see their budgets slashed. 

Despite the demands Congress laid out in the Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthoriza-
tion, and despite ocean acidification and the role the oceans play in global warming, 
the  Administration  still  feels  the  need  to  weaken  our  ocean  programs—in  a  time 
when attention to the oceans is needed now more than ever. 

In  Washington,  the  Puget  Sound  Partnership  is  embarking  on  a  mission  to  save 
the  Puget  Sound’s  ecosystem—everything  from  salmon  to  orca  whales.  But  the 
Puget  Sound  Partnership’s  efforts  cannot  succeed  without  strong  Federal  support— 
and this budget lacks support for either the orcas or the Puget Sound. 
Salmon Recovery Fund 

If you recall, last year I told you how disappointed I was to see the President re-
quest  only  $67  million  for  the  Pacific  Coastal  Salmon  Recovery  Fund—a  program 
that averaged $87 million in funding per year from 2000 to 2005. 

I’m  sure  you  can  guess,  then,  that  I  and  many  of  my  colleagues  are  even  more 
upset at this year’s request of only $35 million—representing a 60 percent cut over 
the historically-funded level. 

This  funding  goes  to  those  on  the  front  lines  of  salmon  recovery—the  states  and 

tribes that do the hard, on-the-ground work to protect our salmon. 

In just the past week we have seen: 
• the  emergency  shut-down  of  West  Coast  Salmon  Fisheries  and  the  declaration 

of a fisheries disaster, 

• the release of new Biological Opinions for Northwest listed Salmon, and 
• the further escalation of the controversy over sea lions and salmon at the Bon-

neville Dam. 

In  such  a  critical  time  for  salmon  recovery,  the  Bush  Administration’s  proposed 

cuts to our salmon recovery funding are unacceptable. 

I  was  also  disappointed  to  see  funding  for  NOAA’s  Education  Program  take  a  51 

percent cut from 2006 levels, from $34 million to $16.5 million.

3 

I look forward to working with you and my colleagues to restore funding to these 

critical programs. 
Doppler Radar Gap 

Finally,  Admiral,  I  would  like  to  briefly  discuss  the  Doppler  radar  gap  on  the 

outer coast of Washington State. 

I  have  discussed  this  issue  with  you  before,  and  last  year  I  secured  funding  for 

a NOAA study on how best to address this gap. 

I  want  to  emphasize,  though,  that  Washington  State  communities  were  dev-

astated by massive storms and flooding last December. 

The urgency for solving this problem is greater now than ever before. 
Two  months  ago  today,  I  held  a  community  meeting  on  this  issue  in  Grays  Har-
bor, Washington, and the message from my constituents was clear: we need a solu-
tion now. 

I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  to  find  that  solution  quickly,  and  imple-

menting it as soon as possible.

marks. 

So  thank  you  again,  Admiral  for  your  testimony  and  for  appearing  here  today  to 

At  this  time  I  would  like  to  hand  it  over  to  my  colleagues  for  their  opening  re-

STATEMENT OF HON. CARL LEVIN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Senator LEVIN. Thank you, Madam Chairman. The—I very much 
appreciate  the  opportunity  to  testify  in  support  of  my  bill,  which 
would  expand  the  boundaries,  out  into  the  Great  Lakes,  of  this 
sanctuary. 

This  is  the  only  freshwater  sanctuary  that  we  have.  Our  other 
sanctuaries  are  all  saltwater.  And  the  difference  that  that  makes, 
in  terms  of  preservation  of  wrecks  is  significant.  Because  it  is 
freshwater  and  there  is  no  salt  in  it,  the  shipwrecks,  which  are— 
this area is famous for, are very well preserved, and the expansion 
of  this  boundary  will  actually  preserve  some  of  our  already  best- 
preserved  wrecks,  because  the  waters  that  we’re  talking  about  are 
deeper waters and colder waters to the ones that already exist. 

It  would  more  than  double  the  number  of  shipwrecks  which  are 
protected.  The  estimate  is,  now,  that  there  are  about  116  ship-
wrecks inside this Shipwreck Alley, the very famous area in Thun-
der  Bay  where  so  many  of  the  ships  which  plied  the  Great  Lakes 
were,  in  fact,  wrecked,  usually  by  weather.  It  would  double  that 
number to over 300 wrecks. These are a huge attraction for us. It’s 
a part of the state which is sometimes overlooked, in terms of tour-
ism and economic development, so there is a real spinoff effect. It’s 
not  just  that  we  get  divers  and  people  who  are  into  the  history  of 
the Great Lakes; this is a major part of the maritime history of the 
Great Lakes that is actually, just, located right in this area because 
of  the  type  of  ships  which  went  down.  So,  this  is  a  huge  edu-
cational attraction, as well as a diving attraction, and that’s of sig-
nificance  to  a  state  which  is  suffering  a  great  deal  economically, 
and  when  we  have  an  attraction  such  as  this,  which  has  just  been 
there  now  8  years,  but  which  has  proven  to  be  a  huge  magnet  for 
people  coming  to  the  lakes,  personally;  but  also,  interestingly 
enough, Madam Chairman, this is, because of our telepresence and 
the  connection  of  this  sanctuary  to  other  sanctuaries  around  the 
country, what is going on underneath those waters can be seen not 
only  in  the  visitors  center  in  Alpena,  but  in  a  number  of  sanc-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

tuaries  around  the  country,  in  real-time.  This  is  the  new  tech-
nology, which has been installed there, which means that there can 
be a connection, educationally, immediately. The curiosity of people 
around  the  country—indeed,  all  the  way  out  to—I  believe,  to  Ha-
waii; I think it’s already connected to the Hawaiian sanctuary—can 
be  met.  Educational  opportunities  can  be  achieved.  The  visitors’ 
presence can be increased. 

The  bottom  line  is  this,  Madam  Chairman.  We’ve  got  an  area 
now  there,  out  in  the  waters—originally,  it  was  supposed  to  be 
larger  than  it  is  now.  It  was  pared  down  because  of  a  reasonable 
determination  that  we  wanted  to  make  sure  that  the  people  along 
those  shores  wanted,  in  fact,  this  kind  of  protection.  So,  it  was  re-
duced from what it was originally intended to be. Now we want to 
go back and increase the protection of these ships. 

There’s no greater cost that is necessary. The only cost issue here 
is whether or not there might be a need, at some point, or a desir-
ability,  for  a  second  NOAA  boat.  We  can  do  this  without  a  second 
NOAA  boat.  We  can  add  protection  to  an  additional  160  or  180 
ships without an additional NOAA boat. We have the Coast Guard 
out  there  anyway.  They’re  going  to  expand  their  station  at  Alpena 
anyway. They do the law enforcement there. They’re the ones that 
protect  these  ships  anyway.  NOAA  does  not  go  out  and  protect 
these ships. Their function is a different function. 

So, while it may desirable, at some point, that there be a second 
NOAA  boat,  we  don’t  have  to  have  a  second  NOAA  boat.  There  is 
no  additional  cost,  in  other  words,  to  expanding  these  boundaries. 
What  is  additional  will  be  the  protection  to  more  than  twice  as 
many  shipwrecks,  which  represent  a  critical  part  of  the  maritime 
history  of  these  lakes  and  represent  a  huge  attraction  for  people, 
both in person and through this telepresence, to understanding this 
history, the excitement and the knowledge that it produces. 

So, we hope that this committee will approve our bill, which pro-
vides for the expansion of these waters. This is not like expanding 
a  national  park,  where  you’ve  got  infrastructure,  where  you’ve  got 
trails,  where  you’ve  got  things  that  have  a  cost  to  them  when  you 
increase the size. 

My  final  point  would  be  this.  We  recently  created—fairly  re-
cently—the most recent sanctuary was the one in Hawaii, which is 
120,000  square  miles  of  water—120,000  square  miles—with  one 
boat  that  NOAA  has,  basically,  to  perform  the  purpose  that  would 
be—is  being  performed  by  the  NOAA  boat  that  we  have.  Our  in-
crease  is  a  very  tiny  increase,  in  terms  of  square  miles,  compared 
to  what  we  just  did  in  Hawaii.  In  fact,  it’s,  like,  one—it’s  120,000 
square miles to that sanctuary in Hawaii; the number of additional 
square miles here is a very small percentage, like 3 percent of that 
area  that  was  just  created  for  Hawaii.  So,  we  hope  that  we  will 
give  this  additional  protection  to  this  spectacular  site  that  is  part 
of the marine history of the Great Lakes. 

We  have  another  Great  Lakes  Senator  which  has  joined  us,  who 
I think has a special appreciation, sensitivity about our history, our 
maritime  history.  The  Chairman  of  this  committee  has  her  own 
very  special  understanding  of  our  coast  and  the  marine  sanctuary 
which  is  in  the  State  of  Washington.  And  this  is  a  unique  sanc-
tuary, because it’s freshwater. We hope that——

And,  by  the  way,  finally,  the  people  support  this.  There’s  no 
doubt  about  that.  We  don’t  have  to  go  through  a  long—years-long 
administrative  process  to  determine  whether  the  people  support 
this.  The  three  counties  involved  are  on  record,  their  resolutions 
are  on  record.  The  townships  all  support  this.  There’s  no  doubt 
about  the  public  support.  So,  we  don’t  want  to  wait  years,  need-
lessly,  for  the  administrative  process  here  to  go  through  the  hear-
ings.  The  three  counties  have  gone  through  that  process  and  are 
on record as supporting this increase in the size. 

Thank you for allowing me to testify and for being with you this 
morning. I’d be happy, obviously, to try to answer a few questions, 
but  there  are  people  here  that  I  know  you  want  to  hear  from  who 
have  firsthand  expertise,  more  than  I  do.  But,  again,  I’d  be  happy 
to try to answer any questions if you have any. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Levin follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CARL LEVIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN 

Thank  you  Senator  Cantwell  and  thank  you  Commerce  Committee  members  for 

allowing me to testify this morning. 

The  Thunder  Bay  National  Marine  Sanctuary,  located  in  Lake  Huron  near 
Alpena,  Michigan,  has  been  a  resounding  success  since  it  was  created  as  a  unique 
Federal-state  partnership  back  in  October  2000.  It  has  preserved  the  proud  mari-
time  history  of  the  Great  Lakes,  offered  educational  opportunities  to  children, 
adults,  maritime  history  enthusiasts,  and  researchers,  and  provided  a  fascinating 
site for divers and snorkelers to explore. 

NOAA initially proposed that the sanctuary cover an area twice as big as was es-
tablished in 2000, but the proposal had to be scaled back to address concerns raised 
by  some  in  the  local  community.  Now,  community  leaders  and  residents  agree  that 
it  is  time  to  expand  the  sanctuary;  numerous  local  units  of  government  have  ex-
pressed their support for an expansion through resolutions. 

Last  year,  I  introduced  legislation  (S.  2281)  that  would  expand  the  sanctuary, 
bringing  even  greater  benefits  to  the  local  community,  historians,  and  people  from 
across  the  country  who  take  advantage  of  the  artifacts  and  educational  resources 
made available there. 

The current sanctuary includes 448 square miles of water and 115 miles of shore-
line,  and  the  expansion  would  include  3,722  square  miles  and  include  226  miles  of 
shoreline. 

Thunder  Bay  has  been  a  regular  byway  for  ships  traveling  on  Lake  Huron,  and 
it earned the name ‘‘Shipwreck Alley’’ because the geography and weather patterns 
in  the  bay  led  to  over  300  shipwrecks.  The  sanctuary  currently  protects  116  ship-
wrecks; the expansion would protect an estimated additional 178 shipwrecks. Addi-
tionally,  the  sanctuary  reserves  and  interprets  the  remains  of  commercial  fishing 
sites, historic docks, and other underwater archaeological sites. 

This  expansion  is  needed  to  protect  the  maritime  history  of  Michigan  and  the 
Great Lakes. Historically, this region was influenced by the demand for natural re-
sources. Because local roads were so inadequate, the Great Lakes became an impor-
tant passageway and trading route for settlement and industrialization. 

The expansion would protect a number of historically significant sites that can il-
luminate the history of commerce on the Great Lakes. For example, it would protect 
the  CORNELIA  B.  WINDIATE,  a  three-mast  wooden  schooner  which  is  one  of  the 
Great Lakes’ most intact shipwrecks. The ship sank in December 1875 when bound 
from  Milwaukee  to  Buffalo  with  a  cargo  of  wheat,  and  was  featured  in  an  episode 
of Deep Sea Detectives on The History Channel. 

This and other shipwrecks are not only historically important, they are very pop-
ular with divers. Because deep water sites are often well preserved in the cold fresh-
water,  they  contain  many  artifacts  and  provide  a  treasure  of  information  about  the 
past.  Many  of  the  shallow  water  wrecks  are  accessible  by  snorkelers,  boaters  and 
kayakers. 

In 2005, NOAA opened the Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center in Alpena, an 
educational  station  and  visitors’  center  that  traces  maritime  history  in  the  Great

visitors  each  year,  but  to  people  around  the  country  who  visit  the  other  13  NOAA 
National Marine Sanctuaries. 

Visitors  to  Thunder  Bay  can  also  view  artifacts  and  interpretive  exhibits  and 
watch films about Thunder Bay and all of our Nation’s Maritime Sanctuaries. Also, 
scientists  from  around  the  world  dock  their  vessels  in  the  Thunder  Bay  River  as 
they use the facility for their research. 

The  Sanctuary  has  also  been  a  real  asset  for  the  local  community,  and  the  com-
munity  has  responded  in  kind.  Since  the  establishment  of  the  Sanctuary,  local  citi-
zens  have  worked  with  the  sanctuary  to  improve  the  Alpena  County  George  N. 
Fletcher Library, to provide volunteers at festivals and outreach events, and to help 
digitize the Thunder Bay Sanctuary Research Collection. 

Since  the  time  glaciers  receded  leaving  the  two  pleasant  peninsulas  that  form 
Michigan,  the  Great  Lakes  have  shaped  my  home  state.  Physical  boundaries  are 
only the beginning. From the Native Americans who lived around and explored the 
lakes  and  adjacent  land,  to  the  European  settlers  who  developed  trading  routes  for 
furs,  then  lumber,  and  eventually  automobiles  that  Michigan  shipped  around  the 
world,  the  Great  Lakes  hold  the  story  of  Michigan’s  history.  One  part  of  that  story 
is  being  preserved  at  the  Thunder  Bay  National  Marine  Sanctuary,  and  that  Sanc-
tuary deserves to be expanded. 

I hope that the Committee will support this effort, and I appreciate your consider-

ation. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  Senator,  let  me  thank  you,  again,  for 
being  here  this  morning  to  talk  about  this  important  legislation, 
the expansion. 

It’s  my  understanding  that  diving  and  fishing  and  other  rec-

reational activities are permitted within this area. 

Senator LEVIN. That is correct. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  And  so,  that  has  probably  led  to  an  easier 
management and oversight, given that those activities are allowed? 
Senator  LEVIN.  Not  only  is  that  true,  but  it’s  also  resulted  in 
greater  public  support.  There  was  some  concern  about  that  on  the 
part  of  the  neighboring  counties.  Two  of  the  three  that  did  not 
originally—they wanted to wait, see how it worked out—because of 
those  kind  of  activities  being  allowed,  they  are  very  supportive  of 
this.  All  three  counties  that  border  on  this  area  are  supportive  of 
this. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And,  in  addition,  it—besides  the  Coast 
Guard,  obviously,  doing  their  day-to-day  duties  on  oversight  of  our 
waters  and  the  variety  of  responsibilities  that  they  have  there,  it 
looks  like  the  Michigan  State  Police  and  County  Sheriff’s  Office 
and your State Department of Natural Resources are also involved 
in policing and enforcing these waters. Is that correct? 

Senator  LEVIN.  They  are.  There’s  a—of  course,  great  reliance, 
more and more, on the Coast Guard, which are—is in those waters 
anyway,  because  of  the  financial—fiscal  constraints  that  the  state 
has,  make  it  even  more  difficult  for  our  state  enforcement  folks  to 
be there. But, the Coast Guard is in all those waters, in any event. 
I wish we could do more, from a D&R perspective, as you point out, 
but our budget constraints make that, I’m afraid, more difficult, so 
I  can’t  point  to  that  as  being,  really,  the  major  source  of  the  en-
forcement.  They’re  there.  There’s  a  presence,  but  it’s  not  as  strong 
as we’d like. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Senator  Klobuchar,  do  you  have  any  ques-

tions?

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  I  just  wanted  to  say  I  was  enjoying 
this  moment,  because,  Senator  Levin,  I’m  the  only  member  of  the 
Subcommittee  that  doesn’t  have  an  ocean.  And  now  that  you’re 
here,  you  and  I,  as  Great  Lakes  Senators,  outnumber  the  ocean 
Senators here, so—as it should be. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LEVIN.  First  time  in—we  call  this  the—we  call  this  the 

Fourth Coast. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Exactly. 
Senator  LEVIN.  And  we—you  and  I  and  the  other  Great  Lakes 
Senators  are  all  part  of  a  Great  Lakes  Task  Force,  which  tries  to 
bring to the attention of our colleagues the fact that this is a longer 
coastline than any other coastline we have. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  one  of  the  things  that  I’m  going  to 
focus on a little today is just the—what we’ve seen, the changes to 
the Great Lakes, in terms of the invasive species and—and I know 
this  wasn’t  the  focus  of  your  testimony  today—but  also  the  low-
ering  in—Lake  Superior,  last  year,  was  at  its  lowest  level  in  80 
years,  because  the  water  has  been  evaporating  with  climate 
change,  the  ice  melting.  And  I  just  wondered  if  you’d  seen  similar 
things with Lake Michigan. 

Senator  LEVIN.  I  think  we  have  some  good  news  on  Lake  Michi-
gan this year, although I’m not positive. I think the majority of our 
lakes  actually  have  seen  a  slight  increase.  And  I  don’t  know  if  it’s 
true in Superior, but I think it is true in Michigan. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  there  might  have  been  an  increase 

this year. We’re just seeing a trend down that—— 

Senator LEVIN. Yes. Oh, no—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR.—has affected our barge traffic. 
Senator LEVIN.—oh, our—the dredging problems that we have at 
all  of  our  ports  is  huge.  We’ve  got  a  major  problem  because  of  the 
lowering of our waters, even though there may have been a bump- 
up this year. It’s one of the greatest problems we face in Michigan, 
is  in  our  ports.  It’s  desperate.  We  have  lost—we  have  lost  access 
to  our  ports  because  they  cannot  be  dredged;  we  don’t  have  the 
funds to get them dredged. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Right.  And  we  also—there  are  some  de-
creases  in  this  budget,  that  I’m  concerned  about,  for  research  that 
was  really—been  very  important  to  our  area.  And  so,  I’m  going  to 
voice those concerns when I have an opportunity. 

So, thank you very much. 
Senator LEVIN. Well, thank you. 
And the Great Lakes Task Force thanks you, Madam Chairman, 
and—for holding these hearings and for your support. I know, even 
though you’re a saltwater state, and we’re freshwater states in the 
Great  Lakes,  that  you  have  a  special  understanding  of  shipping 
and the history of the waters, whether they be salt or fresh, so that 
we feel like we’re in good hands in this committee. 

Thank you. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Levin. And, again, thank 

you for being here this morning.

Just  so  people  are  aware,  our  second  panel  will  focus  on  sanc-
tuary  expansion  issues—this  Thunder  Bay  National  Marine  Sanc-
tuary  issue,  as  well  as  another  one  proposed,  expansion  in  Cali-
fornia.  So,  we  will  have  a  second  panel  on  that,  but  we  appreciate 
Senator Levin coming to be with us this morning. 

We’ll  now  turn  to  Admiral  Lautenbacher  for  your  testimony,  but 
I’m going to make an opening statement first. And if my colleague 
Senator  Klobuchar  would  like  to  follow  with  that,  we  will  proceed 
then with you, Admiral Lautenbacher. 

I  want  to  thank  everyone  for  being  here  today  on  this  oversight 
hearing  of  the  National  Ocean  and  Atmospheric  Administration’s 
Fiscal Year 2009 budget and the issues facing the National Marine 
Sanctuary Program. 

And,  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  again,  thank  you  for  your  time  in 
being here today to talk about these many important issues within 
your budget oversight. 

I  would  like  to  start  with  a  note  of  congratulations.  NOAA  sci-
entists are among the hundreds of researchers across the globe who 
are  contributing  to  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate 
Change. And last year the—that same panel was awarded a Nobel 
Peace  Prize,  and  I’m  delighted  to  see  that  many  of  the  NOAA  sci-
entists shared in this prestigious honor. 

I know that we have a list somewhere here of the scientists that 
were  part  of  that,  so  we’re  going  to  enter  that  into  the  record,  but 
we  do  send  our  congratulations  to  those  who  were  involved  in  this 
vital topic.

IPCC Assessment Reports. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I’m  happy  to  see  that,  for  the  first  time,  the 
President’s  budget  request  for  NOAA  actually  exceeded  last  year’s 
Congressional appropriation. I’m concerned, though, that, when we 
look deeper into how we got to that number, and some of the other 
discussions  that  are  roaming  around  within  the  Department  of 
Commerce,  that  this  may  not  be  as  big  a  victory  as  we  would  like 
to see. 

The  NOAA  fiscal  budget  for  2009,  of  $4.1  billion,  is  5  percent 
above  the  2008  level,  and  almost  this  entire  increase  goes  toward 
funding the cost overruns in the Weather and Climate Satellite Ac-
quisition  Program.  Unfortunately,  though,  that  means  that  the 
NOAA  top-line  budget  request  is  larger,  and  that  the  President  is 
still proposing budget cuts for the Nation’s oceans programs. 

Admiral,  you  know  that  we  have  seen  a  lot  of  attention  lately, 
and  a  lot  of  concern  from  Members  of  this  Committee,  about  the 
satellite  program.  Our  aging  fleet  of  satellites  which  monitor 
weather, hurricanes, climate, and oceans desperately need to be re-
placed,  but  the  failures  of  these  acquisitions  are  impossible  to  ig-
nore. 

The  National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite 
System  will  have  cost  overruns  from  $6.5  billion  to  $12.5  billion,

and  the  lead  contractor,  Northrop  Grumman,  was  awarded  $123 
million in award fees. I think this is inexcusable. 

We also have this discussion about what’s going to happen within 
the  Department  of  Commerce  as  it  relates  to  concerns  about  the 
2010  Census,  the  fact  that  the  Census  Bureau’s  handling  of  com-
puter acquisition has failed, more than doubling the price, the com-
puters  are  riddled  with  many  problems;  and,  to  help  pay  for  this, 
Secretary  Gutie´rrez  has  asked  Congress  to  transfer  $27  million 
from  NOAA  to  the  Census  Bureau  during  this  fiscal  year.  He  has 
indicated  that  he  will  need  to  move  up  $700  million  from  NOAA 
and  other  agencies  in  Fiscal  Year  2009  to  make  up  for  the  Census 
shortfall. 

As these failures threaten to decimate NOAA’s budget, it is, once 
again, the oceans that will suffer the consequences. Because of the 
financial  demands  of  the  Satellite  Acquisition  Program  and  the 
Census Bureau, we are seeing cuts proposed by many of—to many 
of  these  important  programs.  The  National  Ocean  Service,  the  Of-
fice  of  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Research,  the  National  Marine 
Fishery  Service  all  see  their  budgets  slashed.  And,  despite  the  de-
mands Congress laid out in the Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthoriza-
tion,  and  despite  ocean  acidification,  the  role  that  oceans  play  in 
global  warming,  the  Administration  still  sees  the  need  to  weaken 
the  oceans  program  in  a  time  when  we  need  even  more  attention 
than ever. 

If you recall, last year, I was very disappointed to see the—what 
had  been  a  budget  request  in  the  previous  years  of  $87  million  for 
2000  to  2005  for  our  salmon  recovery  plan  only  down  to  $67  mil-
lion.  And  I  expressed  that—disappointed.  So,  I  don’t  think  I’m 
going  to  surprise  you  today  by  saying  that  my  colleagues  are  very 
concerned and upset about the budget request for this year that is 
only  $35  million,  which  is  a  60  percent  reduction  over  the  2000  to 
2005  budget  level.  And  I  can  tell  you,  with  the—all  the  discussion 
this week on the buy up and the salmon recovery plan, how essen-
tial these funds are. These funds go to the front line of salmon re-
covery.  The  states,  the  tribes,  they  do  their  hard  work  to  protect 
our salmon, but they need the additional support. 

And  in  just  this  past  week,  we’ve  seen  the  emergency  shutdown 
of West Coast salmon fisheries and the declaration of a fishery dis-
aster.  I  will  note  that  in  that  request  from  states  we  will  end  up 
seeing  the  Administration  spend  the  same  amount  of  money  we 
could  have  been  spending  on  other  programs  to  help  prevent  this 
situation. 

We saw the release of a new Biological Opinion and further esca-

lation of other fishing issues in the Northwest. 

So,  in  such  a  critical  time  for  salmon  recovery,  the  Administra-
tion, I believe, has proposed unacceptable levels of salmon funding. 
I’m  also  disappointed  to  see  that  NOAA’s  education  program, 
which is focused on environmental stewardship, takes a 51 percent 
cut  from  the  2006  levels,  and  I  look  forward  to  my—working  with 
my colleagues to restore that. 

And, finally, Admiral, I’d like to mention a few other issues that 
are  critically  important,  not  just  to  the  Nation,  but  to  the  North-
west. We have had an opportunity to discuss, in my office, the need 
for  a  Doppler  radar  system  on  the  coast  of  Washington.  We  had

documented  hurricane-force  winds,  according  to  the  Coast  Guard, 
that caused a devastating impact in the Northwest, with floods and 
devastation  last  December.  And  having  a  better  system  there  for 
emergency response is critically important. 

There  are  other  issues  that  I  would  love  to  discuss  here  in  my 
opening remarks, but I want to give my colleagues a chance to also 
make comments. And, Admiral, we have many questions about ev-
erything  from  the  salmon  recovery  plans  to  the  orca  population  to 
many  other  things.  So,  again,  we  appreciate  you  being  here  to  an-
swer these questions. 
Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Madam  Chair.  And 

thank you for holding this hearing. 

Thank  you,  Admiral,  for  being  here.  I  was  reviewing  your  testi-
mony,  and  I  saw  that  you  have—you  mentioned  how  you’ve  con-
verted  a  fleet  of  research  vessels  from  100  percent—from  petro-
leum-based  to  100  percent  bio-based  fuel,  and  I  wanted  to  thank 
you for that. I think it’s a good model that we could look at in other 
areas of the government. 

The—as  I  mentioned  before,  when  Senator  Levin  was  here, 
NOAA’s  role  is  particularly  important  when  it  comes  to  the  Great 
Lakes.  And  I  listed  these  concerns.  I  wanted  to  go  through  them 
again.  While  we  may  have  seen  a  slight  increase  in  the  water  lev-
els  this  year—I’m  just  guessing,  because  we  had  a  little  more 
snow—but  overall  we’ve  seen  a  downward  trend.  Lake  Superior’s 
water levels are at their lowest point—this was last year—in eight 
decades, which have reduced the commercial shipping tonnage that 
can  be  brought  into  our  harbors.  There’s  a  lot  of  concern  in  the 
business  community  about  that.  We’ve  had  invasive  species  issues 
that  have  done  a  lot  of  harm  to  the  lake’s  ecosystem.  We  have  the 
concern  about  the  Asian  carp  coming  up,  and  some  other  things. 
And also, the harbor and open water infrastructure used to manage 
these problems continues to age and deteriorate. 

Given  these  threats  to  the  Great  Lakes  and  other  coastal  mari-
time  environments,  as  Senator  Cantwell  was  going  through,  while 
I understand that you—there was a funding increase in certain im-
portant  areas,  I’m  concerned  about  other  critical  programs  that 
are—that  have  not  received  that  kind  of  treatment  in  the  Presi-
dent’s  FY09  budget.  For  instance,  the  major  research  grants  of 
NOAA,  the  Office  of  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Research,  is  pro-
posed  for  a  decrease  of  over  $15  million.  This  may  include  signifi-
cant  cuts  in  funding  for  the  ocean,  coastal,  and  Great  Lakes  re-
search laboratories. Over the past few years, the Great Lakes Envi-
ronmental  Research  Laboratory  has  conducted  high-quality  re-
search  and  provided  scientific  leadership  on  important  issues  for 
the Great Lakes and for other coastal environments. This research 
has  led  to  innovative  solutions  to  protect  these  environments,  and 
I’m just particularly concerned, because we’re seeing such a change 
in  the  Great  Lakes  environment,  which  I  attribute,  in  large  part, 
to  climate  change.  But,  we’re  seeing  a  major  change,  and  I  would 
think  it  would  be—not  be  a  good  time  to  be  cutting  back  on  re-
search.

With that, I look forward to hearing your testimony, and I thank 
you very much for your work and all the work that the people that 
work with you do. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  We’ve  been  joined  by  our  Ranking  Member, 

Senator Stevens. 

Would you like to make an opening statement? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you very much. 
Good morning, Admiral. It’s nice to see you here. I know that you 
realize  that  our  state  has  half  the  coastline  of  the  United  States, 
and  NOAA  is  one  of  our  most  important  agencies.  I’m  delighted  to 
see that this 2009 budget request is the largest one I’ve ever seen. 
I’m disturbed that the fisheries have been reduced. I hope that you 
can  find  a  way  to  readjust  that  as  we  go  along.  Very  clearly,  it’s 
$46 million less for marine fisheries, which the Chairman has men-
tioned. 

We have, a growing problem in our state, as you know, in terms 
of the IUU fisheries. And they’re outside the 200-mile limit, they’re 
coming  across  our  line.  We’re  trying  our  best  to  work  out,  along 
with  the  various  agencies,  some  form  of  monitoring  the  maritime 
border,  which  is  really  beyond  our  200-mile  limit,  but  at  least  it 
would  give  us  some  understanding  who’s  out  there,  in  terms  of 
these new enormous vessels. 

We  do  not  overfish  any  species.  There  are  no  endangered  or 
threatened  species  that  we  harvest  off  of  Alaska.  And  we’re  very 
proud of our fisheries. We’re very disturbed about the continued in-
crease  in  the  IUU  fisheries  capability,  and  really  more  disturbed 
than  anything  over  the  fact  we  don’t  know  what  they’re  doing.  So, 
I  would  urge  you  to  concentrate  on  that,  to  find  some  way  to  get 
us the knowledge of what species are these vessels harvesting and 
where  are  they  taking  that  catch,  and  is  there  any  way  at  all  for 
us to determine what they’re catching? Because I think they could. 
If we don’t find some way to regulate them, they could destroy ev-
erything  we’ve  done  and  everything  the  world  has  done  by  fol-
lowing  our  example  and  having  a  200-mile  limit  within  which  you 
can have scientific management. Ours is the best in the world, and 
we’d like to work with you to continue that. 

So, I look forward to your statement. I’m pleased to see you here 

Thank you very much. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Stevens. 
Again,  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  welcome  to  the  Committee,  and 

we look forward to hearing your testimony this morning. 

today.

STATEMENT  OF  VICE  ADMIRAL  CONRAD  C.  LAUTENBACHER, 
JR., (U.S. NAVY, RET.), UNDER SECRETARY FOR OCEANS AND 
ATMOSPHERE,  AND  ADMINISTRATOR,  NATIONAL  OCEANIC 
AND  ATMOSPHERIC  ADMINISTRATION,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT 
OF COMMERCE 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Thank  you  very  much,  Madam  Chair, 
Senator Klobuchar, Senator Stevens, and distinguished members of 
the  staff.  It’s  a  great  pleasure  to  be  here  with  you  this  morning. 
I appreciate the support of this committee over the years and the 
interest  that  you  have  in  the  number  of  significant  challenges 
which  you’ve  outlined  in  your  opening  statements.  I  thank  you  for 
your leadership and help with our people and our programs. 

The President’s budget this year supports the priority of advanc-
ing  mission-critical  services.  The  budget  request,  as  mentioned,  is 
$4.1  billion,  which  represents  a  $202  million,  or  5.2-percent,  in-
crease  over  the  enacted  level  in  Fiscal  Year  2008.  The  major  in-
creases are in the areas of satellites, facilities, and implementation 
of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 

For  NOAA  overall,  this  is  the  minimum  that  we  need  to  main-
tain  our  current  level  of  services  and  to  carry  out  our  mission,  to 
understand and predict changes in the Earth’s environment, and to 
conserve  and  manage  coastal,  marine,  and  Great  Lakes  resources. 
NOAA  has  had  many  notable  accomplishments  during  the  past 
fiscal  year.  They’re  recited  in  my  written  testimony,  but  I  want  to 
mention one, which was already mentioned by the Chair. 

First of all, I have always mentioned how proud I am of the peo-
ple  who  work  in  NOAA  and  what  they  do  for  the  Nation.  I’m  par-
ticularly  proud,  this  year,  to  make  mention  of  the  120  NOAA  sci-
entists  that  were  recognized  by  the  Nobel  Prize  Committee  for 
their  work  on  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change. 
Many people in the NOAA family were intimately involved, includ-
ing  numerous  lead,  review,  and  contributing  authors,  as  well  as 
line  offices,  in  our  observations  and  modeling,  which  were  critical. 
I  will  move  to  the  2009  budget  request,  and  I  want  to  highlight 

just a couple of areas for you so we can get to the questioning. 

The  budget  requests  $49  million  in  increases  to  support  the  im-
plementation of the President’s Ocean Initiative. This includes $18 
million to advance ocean science and research, $5 million to protect 
and  restore  marine  and  coastal  areas,  and  more  than  $26  million 
to ensure sustainable use of ocean resources. 

The  budget  also  requests  $32  million  in  increases  to  support  the 
new  provisions  of  the  Magnuson-Stevens  bill  and  to  provide  better 
management  of  fisheries  harvests.  This  includes  an  increase  of 
$81⁄2 million  to  expand  annual  stock  assessments.  Magnuson-Ste-
vens  also  requires  NOAA  to  establish  annual  catch  limits  for  all 
managed  fisheries  by  2011.  To  do  this  effectively,  we  need  sound 
science to determine appropriate catch levels. We are asking for $5 
million in increases to support annual catch limits and stipends, as 
well as $4 million for a resource survey program to track the abun-
dance  of  North  Atlantic  scallops  and  West  Coast  groundfish.  We 
are  also  asking  for  a  $1  million  increase  to  support  enforcement 
against illegal, unregulated, and unreported, or IUU, fishing, which 
has been an important issue to members of the Committee.

16 

The  budget  request  also  includes  $21  million  for  the  Integrated 
Ocean  Observing  System,  or  IOOS.  Projects  to  protect  and  restore 
valuable  marine  and  coastal  areas  include  funding  of  $4  million  to 
implement the newly enacted Marine Debris Research, Prevention, 
and  Reduction  Act.  The  budget  also  provides  $1  million  to  support 
implementation  of  the  Ocean  and  Human  Health  Act  through  the 
Oceans and Human Health Initiative. 

NOAA  views  its  education  mission  as  one  of  its  top  priorities, 
and  has  requested  more  than  $15  million  in  our  2009  budget.  We 
are  currently  updating  our  education  plan,  as  required  by  the 
America COMPETES Act. 

The 2009 budget requests $60 million to support the ongoing con-
struction  and  relocation  efforts  to  the  Pacific  Regional  Center  on 
Ford Island in Hawaii. We are also asking for $8 million to support 
management  of  the  national  monument  in  the  northwestern  Ha-
waiian Islands, mentioned earlier by Senator Levin. 

NOAA  also  requests  funding  to  restore  several  of  our  base  pro-
grams that were reduced in the 2008 omnibus. The fisheries budget 
request includes restoration of just over $8 million for fisheries re-
search  and  monitoring.  This  will  maintain  our  ability  to  provide 
value-added analysis to the Fishery Management Councils. 

The  Weather  Service  budget  request  includes  restoration  of  just 
over  $10  million  for  local  warnings  and  forecasts.  To  enhance  our 
weather forecasting abilities, ensure consistency, we are requesting 
a  funding  increase  of  $242  million  to  continue  support  of  the  Next 
Generation  Geostationary  Satellite  Program,  called  GOES–R. 
These  unique  sentinels  in  the  sky  provide  the  images  of  severe 
weather  you  see  on  TV.  All  of  the  sensors  are  on  contract,  and  we 
plan to issue major contracts for space and ground segments in Fis-
cal Year 2009. This is a critical time for the program, and we must 
keep it on track. 

In  2009,  NOAA  will  invest  more  than  $319  million  on  climate- 
related  activities.  This  is  an  increase  of  $85  million  over  the  FY08 
enacted.  We  are  requesting  an  increase  of  $74  million  for  climate 
sensors  that  were  removed  from  the  Next  Generation  Polar  Sat-
ellite  Program,  or  NPOESS.  The  money  is  specifically  for  instru-
ments  called  TSIS  and  CERES,  which  measure  the  Earth’s  radi-
ation budget. 

NOAA’s  2009  request  provides  modest  new  investments  in  our 
priority areas, while maintaining critical services. We will build on 
our  successes  for  last  year  and  stand  ready  to  meet  the  challenges 
that will surface in 2009 and beyond. 

With  regard  to  the  proposed  boundary  expansion  mentioned  for 
Thunder  Bay,  Cordell  Bank,  and  the  Gulf  of  Farallones  National 
Marine  Sanctuaries,  under  S.  2281  and  H.R.  1187  respectively, 
NOAA generally agrees with the intent of these bills to protect the 
important marine resources off the Michigan and California coasts. 
The  concepts  behind  expanding  these  three  sanctuaries  have  sup-
port  from  the  respective  advisory  councils  and  many  constituents. 
As a general matter, NOAA prefers to manage sanctuaries through 
the  Federal  regulatory  process  rather  than  through  statutory  re-
quirements;  therein,  including  a—robust  public  processes  where 
stakeholders  and  other  constituents  are  given  multiple  opportuni-

ties  to  provide  input.  NOAA  looks  forward  to  working  with  the 
committees—Committee as these bills move forward. 

Again, thank you for your—opportunity to present the budget re-

quest, and I’m happy to answer the questions you may have. 

Thank you. 
[The  prepared  statement  of  Vice  Admiral  Lautenbacher  follows:] 

FOR OCEANS

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C.  LAUTENBACHER,  JR.,  (U.S. 
NAVY,  RET.),  UNDER SECRETARY
AND ATMOSPHERE,  AND 
ADMINISTRATOR,  NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION,  U.S. 
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Madam Chairwoman and Members of the Committee, before I begin my testimony 
I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  your  leadership  and  the  generous  support  you  have 
shown the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Your contin-
ued  support  for  our  programs  is  appreciated  as  we  work  to  improve  our  products 
and  services  for  the  American  people.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on 
the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 Budget Request for NOAA. 

The  FY  2009  President’s  Budget  supports  NOAA’s  priority  to  advance  mission- 
critical  services.  The  FY  2009  request  is  $4.1  billion,  which  represents  a  $202  mil-
lion  or  5.2  percent  increase  over  the  FY  2008  enacted  level.  This  request  includes 
the  level  of  resources  necessary  to  carry  out  NOAA’s  mission,  which  is  to  under-
stand  and  predict  changes  in  the  Earth’s  environment,  and  conserve  and  manage 
coastal  and  marine  resources  to  meet  our  Nation’s  economic,  social  and  environ-
mental  needs.  At  NOAA  we  work  to  protect  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  Americans, 
and provide products and services that benefit the economy, environment, and pub-
lic safety of the Nation. Before I discuss the details of our FY 2009 budget request, 
I  would  like  to  briefly  highlight  some  of  NOAA’s  notable  successes  from  the  past 
Fiscal Year (2007). 
FY 2007 Accomplishments 
NOAA  Is  Major  Contributor  to  Nobel  Prize-Winning  Intergovernmental  Panel  on 

Climate Change Reports 

Scientists  from  NOAA’s  Earth  System  Research  Laboratory  were  among  those 
sharing in the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. The scientists were recognized for their con-
tributions  to  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC).  The  IPCC 
was  created  in  1988  by  the  World  Meteorological  Organization  and  the  United  Na-
tions  Environment  Program  to  provide  regular  assessments  for  policymakers  of  the 
scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of climate change. IPCC has produced 
its major assessments every five to 6 years since 1990. 

NOAA  scientists  served  as  contributors  to  and  government  reviewers  of  the 
Fourth  IPCC  Assessment  Report.  NOAA’s  Geophysical  Fluid  Dynamics  Laboratory 
provided model runs that enhanced the projections used in the IPCC report. 
Magnuson-Stevens Act Implementation 

The  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Reauthorization 
Act of 2007 was signed into law on January 12, 2007. The reauthorized Act contains 
significant  new  provisions  to  end  overfishing,  promote  market-based  approaches  to 
fisheries  management,  improve  the  science  used  in  fisheries  management,  improve 
recreational  data  collection,  enhance  international  cooperation  in  fisheries  manage-
ment,  and  address  illegal,  unreported,  and  unregulated  fishing,  as  well  as  bycatch 
of protected living marine resources. Especially notable is the requirement to estab-
lish  an  annual  catch  limit  for  each  fishery,  which  for  the  first  time  creates  a  man-
date with a timetable to end overfishing. 
Progress on Next Generation Geostationary Satellite Program 

Geostationary satellites remain the weather sentinels for NOAA. The next-genera-
tion  geostationary  satellite  series,  GOES–R,  will  provide  new  and  improved  atmos-
pheric, climatic, solar, and space data. In 2007, NOAA revised the management and 
acquisition  strategy  for  the  GOES–R  program,  partnering  more  closely  with  NASA 
to  take  advantage  of  each  agency’s  technical  expertise.  In  February  2007,  the  Ad-
vanced  Baseline  Imager,  the  main  instrument  on  GOES–R,  completed  a  key  mile-
stone,  enabling  the  contractor  to  begin  building  the  first  instrument.  Throughout 
2007, NOAA awarded the three remaining instrument contracts for the Solar Ultra-
violet  Imager,  Extreme  Ultra  Violet  and  X-Ray  Irradiance  Sensors,  and  Geo-

stationary  Lightning  Mapper.  These  instruments  will  help  us  to  understand  and 
forecast solar disturbances as well as track lightning strikes from space. 
NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service  Provides  More  Specific  Warning  Information  for 

Severe Weather 

NOAA’s National Weather Service (NWS) began issuing more geographically spe-
cific  warnings  for  tornadoes,  severe  thunderstorms,  floods,  and  marine  hazards  on 
October  1,  2007.  The  new  ‘‘storm-based  warnings’’  allow  forecasters  to  pinpoint  the 
specific  area  where  severe  weather  threats  are  highest,  thereby  reducing  the  area 
warned  by  as  much  as  70  percent  when  compared  to  the  previously  used  county- 
by-county warning system. Storm-based warnings are displayed graphically and are 
extremely  adaptable  to  cell  phones,  PDAs,  and  the  Internet.  The  Emergency  Alert 
System (EAS) is geared toward counties and NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) All Haz-
ards will still sound an alarm if there is a warning anywhere in a county. However, 
text  and  audio  messages  will  provide  more  specific  information  about  the  location 
of  the  storm  in  the  county,  and  the  direction  in  which  it  is  moving.  Storm-based 
warnings  will  reference  landmarks  such  as  highways,  shopping  centers,  and  parks, 
and will use directional delimiters to indicate county location. 
Fleet Modernization Moves Ahead 

In  June  2007,  NOAA  celebrated  the  keel  laying  of  NOAA  ships  BELL  M. 
SHIMADA and FERDINAND R. HASSLER in Moss Point, Mississippi. This marked 
the  first  time  NOAA  has  celebrated  this  important  construction  milestone  for  two 
ships simultaneously. HENRY B. BIGELOW, second of the four fisheries survey ves-
sels of the same class being built by VT Halter Marine, was commissioned into the 
fleet  in  July  before  beginning  operations  in  New  England.  In  September,  Phase  I 
of conversion of NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER (formerly USNS CAPABLE) to 
an ocean exploration ship was completed. NOAA ship PISCES was christened in De-
cember and subsequently launched in Moss Point, Mississippi. 
New State-of-the-Art Satellite Operations Facility Officially Opened 

In  June  2007,  NOAA  and  the  General  Services  Administration  officially  opened 
the  new  state-of-the-art  NOAA  Satellite  Operations  Facility  (NSOF).  NSOF  is  the 
new  home  for  NOAA’s  around-the-clock  environmental  satellite  operations,  which 
provides data critical for weather and climate prediction. NSOF supports more than 
$50 million of high technology equipment, including 16 antennas monitoring the op-
erations of 16 on-orbit satellites. 
National Water Level Observation Network Upgraded to Real-time Status 

The  National  Ocean  Service  (NOS)  completed  a  three-year  effort  to  upgrade  the 
technology  of  its  National  Water  Level  Observation  Network  (NWLON).  NWLON 
stations  provide  mariners,  first  responders,  and  the  public  with  real-time  tide  and 
water-level information. A major benefit of the upgrade is that network stations nor-
mally  equipped  to  transmit  water-level  and  other  environmental  data  at  hourly  in-
crements via NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites now trans-
mit data every 6 minutes, thus enabling users to access data more quickly. 
NOAA  Aids  in  the  Recovery  of  Fisheries  and  Fishing  Communities  Damaged  by 

Hurricanes 

NOAA  funded  and  conducted  a  number  of  activities  aimed  at  helping  Gulf  Coast 
fisheries  recover  from  the  devastating  impacts  of  Hurricanes  Katrina,  Rita,  and 
Wilma,  which  struck  the  Gulf  Coast  in  2005.  The  states  are  using  these  funds  to 
restore and rehabilitate oyster, shrimp, and other marine fishery habitats damaged 
or  destroyed  by  hurricane  events,  and  to  conduct  cooperative  research  and  moni-
toring  and  other  activities  designed  to  recover  and  rebuild  Gulf  of  Mexico  fisheries 
and fishing communities.

NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service  added  16  broadcast  stations  to  the  NOAA 
Weather  Radio  (NWR)  All  Hazards  network  in  2007.  In  addition  to  achieving  100 
percent  coverage  of  high-risk  areas,  NOAA  refurbished  62  broadcast  stations  with 
technology  upgrades  that  significantly  improved  reliability  and  availability,  while 
decreasing  maintenance  costs.  This  allows  the  network  to  meet  expectations  of 
availability as the Nation’s weather and all hazard warning system. 

NWR is a reliable and inexpensive means of communicating weather, hazard, and 
emergency information directly to the public. The network infrastructure consists of 
986  broadcast  stations  covering  98  percent  of  the  Nation’s  population  and  has  the 
ability  to  deliver  messages  to  individuals  monitoring  their  own  receivers  as  well  as

the  ability  to  reach  millions  of  listeners  and  viewers  through  the  Emergency  Alert 
System,  which  is  monitored  by  television  and  radio  license  holders.  The  network  is 
required  to  broadcast  to  all  areas  of  the  United  States  identified  as  being  at  high 
risk  of  experiencing  severe  weather  and  to  sustain  a  high  level  of  reliability  and 
maintainability in those areas. 
Marine Reserves Established in Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary 

In  2007,  NOS  established  the  Federal  portion  of  the  marine  reserves  and  con-
servation  area  network  within  the  Channel  Islands  National  Marine  Sanctuary. 
This is the largest network of marine reserves in Federal waters in the continental 
United  States.  This  action  complements  the  State  of  California’s  established  net-
work of marine reserves and conservation areas within the state waters of the sanc-
tuary in 2003. 
Expanding U.S. Tsunami Preparedness 

NOAA’s  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  is  responsible  for  the  expansion  of  the 
U.S. network of tsunami detection sensors. During 2007, 14 Deep-ocean Assessment 
and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DARTTM)  buoys  were  established:  four  in  the  Western 
Pacific  Ocean,  three  off  the  Pacific  Coast  of  Central  America,  five  in  the  north-
western Pacific Ocean, and two in the North Atlantic Ocean, bringing the total num-
ber  of  U.S.  DARTTM stations  to  34.  The  United  States,  with  NOAA  as  lead  agency, 
is  currently  working  with  approximately  70  countries,  the  European  Commission, 
and  over  50  non-governmental  agencies  in  planning  and  implementing  the  Global 
Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS),  which  includes  a  global  tsunami 
warning system. In addition, NWS works with communities to prepare for tsunamis 
through  the  TsunamiReadyTM Program.  As  of  December  12,  2007,  there  are  47 
TsunamiReadyTM sites in 10 states, Puerto Rico, and Guam. The National Weather 
Service reached its goal of recognizing 10 new TsunamiReadyTM communities in Fis-
cal Year 2007. 
First Buoy to Measure Acidification Launched 

The first buoy to directly monitor ocean acidification was launched in the Gulf of 
Alaska. Ocean acidification is a result of carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean. The 
new buoy, part of a National Science Foundation project awarded to PMEL and the 
University  of  Washington  in  Seattle,  in  collaboration  with  Fisheries  and  Oceans 
Canada and the Institute of Ocean Sciences in British Columbia, measures the air- 
sea  exchange  of  carbon  dioxide,  oxygen,  and  nitrogen  gas,  in  addition  to  the  pH  (a 
measure of ocean acidity) of the surface waters. The buoy is anchored in water near-
ly  5,000  meters  deep  and  transmits  data  via  satellite.  Rising  acidity  in  the  ocean 
could have a detrimental effect on ocean organisms, with resulting impacts on ocean 
life and the food chain. 
NOAA Ships Arrive at New Home Port in Hawaii 

NOAA ships OSCAR ELTON SETTE, HI’IALAKAI, and KA’IMIMOANA relocated 
to their new home port at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, heralding the perma-
nent  presence  of  NOAA  on  Ford  Island.  This  was  a  major  milestone  in  the  multi- 
year,  multi-phase  construction  of  the  NOAA  Pacific  Regional  Center,  a  project  to 
consolidate NOAA programs and operations on the island of Oahu into a single facil-
ity on Ford Island. 
NOAA’s Open Rivers Initiative Completes First Projects 

In  its  first  year,  NOAA’s  Open  Rivers  Initiative  completed  three  projects  that  re-
stored  over  30  miles  of  spawning  and  rearing  habitat  for  migratory  fish.  The  obso-
lete  Brownsville  Dam,  located  on  the  Calapooia  River  in  Oregon,  was  removed  in 
August  2007,  effectively  eliminating  an  obstruction  to  migratory  fish  and  a  safety 
hazard to the local human community. In California, two failing and undersized cul-
verts  were  removed,  allowing  endangered  salmon  to  reach  their  historic  spawning 
and  rearing  grounds.  In  collaboration  with  local  communities,  NOAA’s  Open  Rivers 
Initiative  will  continue  to  restore  free  fish  passage  to  historic  habitat  by  removing 
obsolete dams and barriers that dot the rivers of coastal states. 
Delivering Real-Time Data to Help Shellfish Growers 

Shellfish growers in the Pacific Northwest can now get near real-time water qual-
ity data from the System-wide Monitoring Program operating at National Estuarine 
Research  Reserves  in  Alaska,  Washington,  and  Oregon.  The  data  are  available 
through  telemetering  capabilities,  which  measure,  receive,  and  transmit  data  auto-
matically from distant sources. Water quality data can be viewed on a website joint-
ly sponsored by NOS and the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing 
Systems  (http://www.nanoos-shellfish.org/).  Water  quality  and  weather  data  are

transmitted  every  30  minutes  via  satellite  from  monitoring  stations  at  all  27  Na-
tional  Estuarine  Research  Reserves,  providing  information  to  the  growing  Inte-
grated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). 
Great Lakes Lab Recognized for ‘Green’ Research Vessels 

NOAA’s  Great  Lakes  Environmental  Research  Laboratory  (GLERL)  converted  a 
fleet of research vessels from petroleum-based to 100 percent bio-based fuel and lu-
bricants,  earning  a  White  House  Closing-the-Circle  Award  in  the  green  purchasing 
category.  GLERL  operates  research  vessels  throughout  the  Great  Lakes  region  as 
scientific  platforms  for  ecosystems  research  and  other  NOAA  interests  in  the  area. 
The conversion was a result of a call for ‘‘greening’’ of Government agencies through 
waste reduction, recycling, and the use of environmentally friendly and sustainable 
products including bio-products. 
FY 2009 Budget Request Highlights 
Supporting the President’s Ocean Initiative 

Building  on  last  year’s  investment  in  Ocean  Initiative  related  activities,  the  FY 
2009 President’s Request includes new increases of $49.1 million for NOAA over the 
FY 2008 President’s Request to support the President’s Ocean Initiative. This ocean 
initiative includes more funding to advance ocean science and research; protect and 
restore marine and coastal areas; and ensure sustainable use of ocean resources. 

New  investments  in  ocean  science  are  aimed  at  monitoring  and  better  under-
standing  marine  ecosystems.  Increased  funding  of  $7.0  million  is  included  for  the 
Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) to support Data Management and Com-
munications,  Regional  Observations,  and  the  Data  Assembly  Center  (DAC),  which 
delivers  real-time,  quality  controlled  data  from  NOAA  and  regional  observing  sys-
tems. An increase of $1 million is requested to manage the escalating size and quan-
tity  of  hydrographic  datasets  collected  by  NOAA  and  other  providers.  This  increase 
in  funding  will  help  NOAA  update  the  nautical  charts  provided  to  mariners  navi-
gating  on  U.S.  waters  in  a  more  timely  fashion.  In  addition,  NOAA  is  requesting 
$2  million  in  increased  funding  for  the  PORTS® program,  to  improve  and  expand 
the  delivery  of  real-time  and  forecasted  navigation  information.  A  recent  economic 
benefits  study  of  the  Houston/Galveston  PORTS® program,  released  in  May  2007, 
showed  that  the  program  brought  the  Houston/Galveston  area  significant  economic 
benefits and has helped to achieve a 50 percent reduction in groundings. 

Projects to protect and restore valuable marine and coastal areas include funding 
of  $4  million  to  implement  the  newly  enacted  Marine  Debris  Research,  Prevention, 
and Reduction Act. This funding will allow NOAA to provide competitive grants and 
to develop the first Federal clearinghouse on marine debris. NOAA also requests in-
creased funding of $5.4 million for the Open Rivers program to restore stream miles 
of fish habitat through watershed-level projects with multiple fish passage opportu-
nities. 

Finally,  the  budget  provides  support  to  ensure  sustainable  access  to  seafood 
through  the  development  of  offshore  aquaculture  and  better  management  of  fish 
harvests.  In  direct  support  of  new  provisions  of  the  MSRA,  and  to  provide  better 
management  of  fish  harvests,  NOAA  requests  increased  funding  of  $31.8  million 
over the FY 2008 enacted level. Of this amount, $5.1 million is requested to enhance 
the independent peer-review process for scientific data required to appropriately set 
the  annual  catch  limits  for  all  managed  fisheries;  $8.5  million  will  initiate  and  ex-
pand existing sampling programs and management procedures in order to end over-
fishing by 2011, as mandated by the MSRA; and $3.0 million will complete the final 
implementation  phase  of  a  new  registry  system  for  recreational  fishermen  and  for- 
hire  fishing  vehicles.  An  additional  $1.5  million  increase  is  requested  in  support  of 
deep  sea  coral  research,  allowing  NOAA  to  begin  identifying,  understanding,  and 
providing the information needed in order to protect deep coral habitats. 
Sustaining Critical Operations 

As  always,  I  support  NOAA’s  employees  by  requesting  adequate  funding  for  our 
people, infrastructure, and facilities. NOAA’s core values are people, integrity, excel-
lence,  teamwork,  ingenuity,  science,  service,  and  stewardship.  Our  ability  to  serve 
the Nation and accomplish the missions outlined below is determined by the quality 
of our people and the tools they employ. Our facilities, ships, aircraft, environmental 
satellites,  data-processing  systems,  computing  and  communications  systems,  and 
our  approach  to  management  provide  the  foundation  of  support  for  all  of  our  pro-
grams.  Approximately  $42.0  million  in  net  increases  will  support  our  workforce  in-
flation factors, including $37.5 million for salaries and benefits and $4.5 million for 
non-labor-related adjustments, such as fuel costs.

This year we have focused our increases on satellite continuity and operations and 
maintenance  support  for  our  aircraft  and  NOAA  vessels.  A  funding  increase  of 
$242.2  million  is  requested  to  continue  support  of  the  Geostationary  Operational 
Satellites (GOES–R) program. GOES satellites provide critical atmospheric, oceanic, 
climatic,  and  solar  products  supporting  weather 
forecasting  and  warnings, 
climatologic analysis and prediction, ecosystems management, and safe and efficient 
public  and  private  transportation.  This  increase  will  be  used  for  continued  systems 
engineering,  development  of  satellite  instruments,  risk  reduction  activities,  and 
transition to the systems-level acquisition and operations phase of the program. 

Funding  of  $6.1  million  is  also  requested  in  support  of  a  Major  Repair  Period  for 
the  RAINIER,  NOAA’s  most  productive  hydrographic  vessel.  At  39  years  old,  the 
RAINIER  requires  a  major  capital  investment  in  its  mechanical  and  electrical  sys-
tems  in  order  to  maintain  its  current  operational  tempo  and  reduce  risks  to  per-
sonnel, property, and mission capability. 

Finally, NOAA requests an increase of $4.0 million in support of additional flight 
hours  and  operations  and  maintenance  for  our  aircraft.  The  requested  funds  will 
provide an additional 1,295 flight hours for hurricane research, surveillance, and re-
connaissance,  as  well  as  for  other  research  and  forecasting  requirements.  NOAA 
also  asks  this  year  for  restoration  to  several  of  our  base  programs,  most  notably  in 
the National Weather Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. These re-
quested  increases  in  our  base  accounts  will  allow  NOAA  to  sustain  on-going  pro-
grams  and  projects  at  the  levels  recommended  in  the  FY  2008  President’s  Budget. 
Improving Weather Warnings and Forecasts 

Severe  weather  events  cause  $11  billion  in  damages  and  approximately  7,000 
weather-related  fatalities  yearly  in  the  United  States.  Nearly  one-third  of  the  U.S. 
economy is sensitive to weather and climate. Realizing this, NOAA seeks to provide 
decisionmakers with key observations, analyses, predictions, and warnings for a va-
riety  of  weather  and  water  conditions  to  help  protect  the  health,  life,  and  property 
of  the  U.S.  and  its  economy.  Landfalling  hurricanes  are  one  of  the  most  physically 
destructive  and  economically  disruptive  extreme  events  that  impact  the  United 
States, often causing billions of dollars of damage in their wake. In FY 2009, NOAA 
will  continue  to  improve  our  hurricane  research  and  modeling  capabilities  with  a 
requested  increase  of  $4.0  million  for  operational  support  and  maintenance  of  the 
next-generation  Hurricane  Weather  Research  and  Forecasting  model  and  storm 
surge  prediction  system,  as  well  as  accelerated  improvements  to  that  system.  In-
creased  funding  of  $3.0  million  will  support  the  operations  and  maintenance  of  15 
hurricane data buoys in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean, en-
hancing our real-time hurricane storm monitoring and observations. NOAA also con-
tinues to improve and maintain our weather warning infrastructure, with requested 
funding  of  $6.6  million  to  upgrade  the  Advanced  Weather  Interactive  Processing 
System,  the  Nation’s  weather  and  flood  warning  system.  Increased  funding  of  $4.8 
million will be used to upgrade twelve NOAA Wind Profilers and to perform a tech- 
refresh on this twenty-year-old radar system. Finally, NOAA is requesting $2.9 mil-
lion  in  increased  funding  for  modernization  of  the  NOAA  Weather  Radio  network. 
Climate Monitoring and Research 

Society  exists  in  a  highly  variable  climate  system,  and  major  climatic  events  can 
impose  serious  consequences  on  society.  Preliminary  estimates  of  the  impact  of  the 
severe  drought  which  affected  the  Great  Plains  and  the  Eastern  United  States 
throughout 2007 are in the range of $5 billion, with major reductions in crop yields 
and  low  stream  and  lake  levels.  Continued  drought  and  high  winds  in  the  Western 
United  States  in  2007  resulted  in  numerous  wildfires,  with  3,000  homes  and  over 
8.9 million acres burned, and at least 12 deaths. The FY 2009 Budget Request con-
tains investments in several programs aimed at increasing our predictive capability, 
enabling NOAA to provide our customers (farmers, utilities, land managers, weather 
risk industry, fisheries resource managers and decisionmakers) with assessments of 
current  and  future  impacts  of  climate  events  such  as  droughts,  floods,  and  trends 
in extreme climate events. NOAA continues to build a suite of information, products, 
and  services  that  will  enable  society  to  respond  to  changing  climate  conditions.  In 
FY  2009,  NOAA  will  support  the  critical  National  Integrated  Drought  Information 
System with increases of $2 million to develop and bring into operation by FY 2010 
the  next-generation  Climate  Forecast  System,  leading  to  improved  climate  fore-
casting products. An increase of $74 million will be used to develop Clouds and the 
Earth’s  Radiant  Energy  System  (CERES)  and  Total  Solar  Irradiance  Sensor  (TSIS) 
climate  sensors  to  preserve  decades  long  climate  data  records.  The  CERES  sensor 
will  measure  the  Earth’s  radiation  budget,  an  essential  measurement  for  deter-
mining the causes of climate variability and change. The TSIS sensor measures the

total  energy  of  the  sun  falling  on  the  Earth,  a  measurement  used  to  identify  and 
isolate natural solar variations that impact climate in contrast to other factors, such 
as human influences on climate. 
Critical Facilities Investments 

The  FY  2009  President’s  Budget  Request  also  includes  important  increases  for 
critical  facilities,  necessary  to  provide  a  safe  and  effective  working  environment  for 
NOAA’s employees. 

For  FY  2009,  NOAA  will  concentrate  their  modernization  efforts  on  three  main 
projects. NOAA requests an increase of $40.2 million for the continued construction 
of the new Pacific Region Center on Ford Island in Honolulu, Hawaii. This increase 
in  funding  will  support  the  continued  construction  and  renovation  of  two  buildings, 
enabling  NOAA  to  reduce  expenditures  for  rent  and  relocate  operations  from  their 
current  location  in  the  deteriorating  Kewalo  Basin  and  Dole  Street  Lab  Facilities. 
An  increase  of  $12.1  million  will  complete  the  design  and  initial  preparations  for 
a  replacement  facility  for  the  Southwest  Fisheries  Science  Center.  Finally,  $11.7 
million  is  requested  to  support  the  installation  of  a  semi-permanent  replacement 
structure  for  the  at-risk  Operations  Complex  at  the  NESDIS  Command  and  Data 
Acquisition  Station  in  Fairbanks,  Alaska.  The  current  facility  is  at  risk  to  experi-
ence  a  major  structural  failure  in  the  next  5  years.  The  requested  funding  will  en-
sure that NOAA maintains crucial mission operations support for the Polar-orbiting 
satellites, as well as backup support for others. 
Conclusion 

NOAA’s  FY  2009  Budget  Request  provides  essential  new  investments  in  our  pri-
ority  areas  while  maintaining  critical  services,  reflecting  NOAA’s  vision,  mission, 
and core values. The work NOAA accomplished in 2007 impacted every U.S. citizen. 
We  will  build  on  our  successes  from  last  year,  and  stand  ready  to  meet  the  chal-
lenges  that  will  surface  in  FY  2009  and  beyond.  NOAA  is  dedicated  to  enhancing 
economic  security  and  national  safety  through  research  and  accurate  prediction  of 
weather  and  climate-related  events,  and  to  providing  environmental  stewardship  of 
our  Nation’s  coastal  and  marine  resources.  That  concludes  my  statement,  Madam 
Chairwoman. Thank you for the opportunity to present NOAA’s FY 2009 Budget Re-
quest. I am happy to respond to any questions the Committee may have. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Admiral, very much. 
And  if  I  could  start  with  something  that’s  a  very  burning  issue 
in our state, the salmon Biological Opinion issue. Obviously, at the 
direction of a very frustrated judge, the previous opinion, there was 
lots of concern. And since what the court has released, what we’ve 
just  seen  is,  you  know,  the  work  of  four  states,  four  Federal  agen-
cies,  seven  tribes,  so  there  is  much  collaboration.  And  so,  I  think 
that’s  encouraging,  that  there  is  that  much  collaboration.  But,  it’s 
going  to  take  a  lot  of  hard  work  to  continue  to  make  this  plan  a 
success. And so, what is your plan to make sure that the collabora-
tion and implementation phase goes well? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Well, first of all, we’re committed to the 
collaboration.  I’m  hoping  that  people  have  reviewed  the  Biological 
Opinion that stated it incorporates much of the public commentary 
as—and  building  a  general  consensus  as  to  where  we  ought  to  go. 
Our program includes $12.3 million to try to ensure that the im-
plementation  is  done  correctly.  This  is  at  a  level  that  allows  us  to 
follow  the  implementation  of  it  and  ensure  that  it  is  managed  cor-
rectly.  We  will  continue  to  support  that  commitment,  and  we—as 
we go forward, and provide the resources and the people necessary 
to support and monitor the Biological Opinion. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  how  do  we  look  at  this  issue?  I  mean, 
I  don’t  understand—how  do  you  think  you’re  well-positioned  to  do 
that,  if  we  see  this  60  percent  cut  in  the  salmon  recovery  funds? 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  The  Salmon  Recovery  Fund  is—which 
is—it’s  all  connected.  First  of  all,  we  have  a  fairly  robust  salmon 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

budget,  when  you  look  at  the  entire  picture.  From  the  Salmon  Re-
covery  Fund,  this  is  an  area  where  we’ve  invested  probably  a  bil-
lion  dollars  in  working  in  this  way.  We  had,  this  year,  a  limited 
amount  of  resources  and  a  number  of  requirements,  so  this  is  a 
matter of priority, it’s not a matter that I don’t view that that pro-
gram  is  worthwhile  or  that  there—or  that  the  funding  wouldn’t  be 
used—or  it’s  not—it’s  not—it’s  not  been  reduced  from  our  require-
ments  list.  But,  if  you  go  through  the  programs  that  we  have  to 
support  for  the  Northwest  and  for  all  the  fisheries,  these  are  the 
decisions  we  made  in  priority.  As  I  always  do  when  I  come  here, 
I’m  willing  to  work  and  to  look  for  the  best  program  that  we  can 
provide for the money that we have to offer. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  But,  wouldn’t  you  say—wouldn’t  you  say,  on 
the surface of it, having this biological opinion and all the coordina-
tion that it takes, and then seeing that the funds are being cut 60 
percent,  it’s  kind  of  hard  to  imagine  how  that’s  going  to  support 
that effort? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Well,  there  is  still  a  considerable 
amount of effort going on for recovery, the recovery plans. We have 
the  money  to  support  the  monitoring  and  the  evolution  of  the  bio-
logical opinion, as it pertains to the recovery efforts that are going 
on in the Columbia River, so we’ll be able to tell what’s happening 
and  what’s  not  happening  and  how  things  are  improving.  If  we 
need to provide more, those types of results will be shown from the 
monitoring efforts. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  It’s  my  understanding,  though,  that  some  of 
those  same  monitoring  and  mapping  efforts  are  also  being  cur-
tailed.  And  so,  I  look  at  it  as—if  someone  thinks  that  somehow 
that’s  going  to  help  us  in  saving  budget  costs,  because  now,  here 
we  are  having  a  disaster  declared,  having  states,  you  know,  all 
along  the  West  Coast  coming  and  looking  for  Federal  dollars,  and 
perhaps  some  of  the  mapping  programs  and  some  of  the  planning 
would have detailed some of this. So, I feel like we’re still spending 
the  money  that—from  a  disaster-recovery  perspective,  after-the- 
fact, after the disaster. So, I look forward to working with you spe-
cifically  on  making  sure  there  is  an  appropriate  amount  of  money 
there for salmon recovery and that the biological opinion is able to 
be carried forward. So, I’ll look forward to working with you in de-
tail on that. 

Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much, Senator Cantwell. 
Admiral  in  my  opening  statement  I  talked  about  the  President’s 
budget, proposed cuts to the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Re-
search,  and  specifically  I’m  concerned  about  the  impact  this  may 
have  on  the  ocean,  coastal,  and  Great  Lakes  research  laboratories, 
including  the  work  of  the  Great  Lakes  Environmental  Research 
Laboratory  that  I  believe  is  essential  to  properly  maintain  the 
Great Lakes ecosystem. 

What  impact  do  you  think  this  is  going  to  have  on  the  labora-

tory’s ability to complete their assigned research projects? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Regarding  the  issue  about  the  overall 
reduction, there was an overall reduction in OAR from the enacted. 
That’s  generally  consistent  with  the  pattern  of  adjusting,  as  we  do 
year  by  year  for  one-time  Congressional  additions  which  have

24 

been—which are made to the budget. The good news is, that reduc-
tion  is  less  than  it  was  last  year.  I  know  that’s  not  much,  you 
know,  solace,  but  it  is—we  are  doing  better,  I  think,  in  terms  of 
bringing  Congress  and  the  Administration  together  on  what  that 
level is. So—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. But, what—— 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER.—it’s not—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR.—impact do you think this budget level will 

have on the research projects that are going on? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Let me talk about the Great Lakes. Our 
budget  for  the  Great  Lakes  is  roughly  equal  to  what  it  was  last 
year. Some of the money is in a few different places, but we believe 
that  the  Great  Lakes  Environmental  Research  Laboratory  is  fund-
ed at roughly the same levels as it was last year, so we were able— 
we will be able to continue with our projects on zebra mussels, our 
projects  on  building  the  Great  Lakes  Observing  System,  our  work 
with  USGS  and  EPA  on  the  Great  Lakes  Task  Force  to  ensure 
some progress is made in these areas. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Could  I  just  mention—thank  you—and 

could I just mention a few things, important things—— 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.—that—some  of  the  initiatives  underway.  I 
just  want  to  make  sure  you  don’t  foresee  cuts  to  them.  The  efforts 
to  explain  and  to  predict  changes  in  water  resources,  lake  water 
levels,  and  ice  cover,  do  you  think  there’ll  be  changes  to  that  be-
cause of the budget? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. No. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. OK. The measures to prevent the introduc-

tion of aquatic invasive species, that I talked about earlier? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. With the exception of any changes that 
were  made—last-minute  changes  made—and  I  don’t  have  that  in 
front of me—first of all, there is a very small amount of money we 
devote to that. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Yes. 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  You  know,  I  think  we  can  probably  all 
agree  on  that.  It’s  roughly  about  the  same  as  it  was  last  year.  I 
don’t expect that there’ll be much of a change—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. But, could we just—— 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER.—in our level of support for—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR.—focus on that a little bit? Is that—— 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.—you  know,  that  these  species  oftentimes 
enter  the  lakes  through  the  ballast  water.  Could  you  talk  a  little 
bit  about  what  you  see  that—the  effect—the  impact  these  species 
have,  or  may  have,  in  terms  of  plagues  or  what  other  things  they 
could spread? And, obviously, we’re trying to take some action, here 
in Congress, with ballast water. But, just you—what you see as the 
threat from the invasive species. 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  The  invasive  species  are  an  enormous 
threat  to  all  of  our  coasts  and  the  Great  Lakes,  as  has  been  docu-
mented.  In  many  places,  once  invasive  species  gain  a  hold,  they’re 
very difficult or impossible to remove. They require a great deal of 
effort  and  a  lot  of  resources  to  contain  them  and  to  mitigate  some

of the effects. So, they’re—it is something that we need to work on 
and to prevent. 

The  best  way  is  to  prevent  them  from  coming  in,  which  is  edu-
cation and barriers and ways to deal with it preemptively, because 
once  they  get  a  foothold,  then  it’s  very  difficult,  as  you  know  from 
the zebra mussel issue that we have—— 

So,  we  support—we’ve  worked  on  education  programs,  we’ve 
worked  on  research  projects,  we  have  supported  the  ballast  water 
bill  to  improve  the  ‘‘no  ballast  on  board’’—the  ‘‘BOB  ships’’  that 
come in—to improve our ability to reduce the levels of risk involved 
with  having  any  kinds  of  invasive  species  in  the  Great  Lakes  and 
to strengthen the requirements for that—for the water coming into 
the Great Lakes—ballast water coming into the Great Lakes. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  And  one  last  thing,  I  mentioned,  in  my 
opening, about how you converted the fleet of research vessels from 
petroleum-based  to  100  percent  bio-based  fuel.  Do  you  see  this  as 
a future model for NOAA, for other vessels, and for the government 
as  a  whole?  And  are  there  other  similar  green  programs  that 
NOAA is conducting elsewhere? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  do.  We  have  a  staff  that’s  very  inter-
ested  in  green  projects.  The  facilities  that  we’ve  worked  on  are  all 
green  facilities,  and  we’ve  won  prizes  for  the  buildings  that  we’ve 
put  up.  They’re  very  energy  efficient  and  in  line  with  the  latest 
technology. We are looking at the experimental or research conver-
sions  of  the  ships  on  the  Great  Lakes  as  a  model  for  the  rest  of 
NOAA  boats  that  will  be,  you  know,  compatible  will  that  kind  of 
conversion.  It  is—it’s  an  important  example,  and  we’re  very  proud 
of the work we’ve done there, and we’re going to advertise and try 
to expand it. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  thank  you  very  much.  And  if  I  have 
some follow up questions on the budget, we’ll put them in writing. 
Appreciate it. 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. I’d be happy to respond. Thank you. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
Senator CANTWELL. Senator Stevens? 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you very much. 
Admiral I note that there is $1 million that’s earmarked for fish-
eries  enforcement,  and  I  question  whether  this  is  enough  to  deal 
with the law enforcement in the fisheries area, particularly in view 
of  this  expanding  threat  from  the  IUU  fisheries.  Where  are  you 
going to get the money for law enforcement? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  We—the  law  enforcement’s  a—an  issue 
that’s  handled  both  by  our  fisheries  marshals,  the  Coast  Guard, 
and the local port authorities for entry into the United States. Our 
increases  for  IUU—we’ve  basically  doubled  the  amount  of  money 
against it. Now, it’s not a lot of money, I agree, but it—but it’s put 
in very—some very critical areas. 

We  have  two  major  thrusts  that  we’re  trying  to  work  on.  First 
of  all  is  to,  as  you’ve  said,  find  out  what’s  going  on,  on  the  high 
seas.  We’re  working,  you  know,  intently  through  the  regional  fish-
eries  management  organizations,  the  international  organizations. 
In  fact,  there  is  even  a  new  one  in  the  Pacific  that  we’re  now  sup-
porting. So, those are organizations that have regulations and have 
visibility  into  what’s  going  on  in  the  various  parts  of  our  oceans. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

26 

So, we are putting more effort into trying to ensure we understand 
what’s  coming  out  of  those  organizations  and  so  that  we  can  have 
the  enforcement  so  that  the  products  that  are  illegally  taken  are 
not—do not enter this country, and that we can stand up and make 
a  case  in  the  world  court  of  opinion  to  ensure  that  they  are  not 
being  marketed  in  other  places,  as  well.  So,  the  other  half  of  the 
increase is designed to improve our ability to be able enforce those 
regulations at our ports of entry, that we will not tolerate that, and 
we  will  then,  through  the—as  I  said,  through  the  international  or-
ganizations,  push  them  to  accept  the  same  kinds  of  limitations  on 
buying illegally caught fish. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I’ve  been  in  hopes  that  NOAA,  working 
with the Coast Guard, would be able to give the State Department 
the information it needs to go to the U.N. to try and start an initia-
tive  to  bring  about  U.N.  recognition  of  the  problem  and  action  to 
deal with the IUU fisheries. It doesn’t seem to me that this million 
dollars is going to go that far. I would hope, at the very least, that 
you  would  agree  that  you  could  start  a  task  force  with  the  Coast 
Guard,  working  with  the  State  Department,  to  find  money  within 
the three agencies to deal with this. 

Now,  in  my  opinion,  the  IUU  fisheries  are  growing  so  large  that 
they’re  going  to  monopolize  the  high  seas,  they’re  going  to  attack 
the  species  that  go  beyond  the  200  mile  limits,  and  they’re  going 
to destroy the reproductive capability, particularly of the North Pa-
cific, if we don’t get on them. Now, I don’t see that, sense of emer-
gency  in  this  budget,  and  I  certainly  don’t  see  it  as  far  as  the  co-
operation  between  your  agency,  the  State  Department,  and  the 
Coast Guard. 

Now,  the  Coast  Guard,  is  more  aware  of  the  presence  of  the 
emergency. But if I’m informed correctly, this IUU fleet is expand-
ing  exponentially,  it’s  almost  doubling  every  2  years.  Now,  we’ve 
just  got  to  get  a  handle  on  that  or  there  are  not  going  to  be  fish-
eries  of  the  world  left.  There  is  no  regulation,  no  science,  and  no 
reporting at all. 

And,  Admiral,  with  your  background,  I’m  sure  you  could  get  the 
cooperation  of  the  Coast  Guard,  but  I  would  hope  you’d  commit 
yourself  to  really  getting  this  initiated.  There’s  going  to  be  a 
change  of  Administration.  God  knows  who’s  going  to  be  in  charge 
of  the  next  Administration  in  your  area.  But,  in  any  event,  we’ve 
got  to  have  something  that’s  nonpartisan,  that  is  directed  toward 
ending IUU fisheries. And if we don’t, the fish that we get and we 
harvest for our Nation off Alaska are going to be gone. 

Already,  we’re  seeing  runs  completely  disappear,  as  you  know. 
We’ve  had  areas  that  have  produced  salmon  for  years  and  years 
and  years,  all  of  a  sudden,  bam,  they’re  closed,  there  are  no  fish 
there  at  all.  That’s  only  coming  about  because  of  these  IUU  fish-
eries. 

Now, I don’t see a sense of urgency coming out of this plan, and 
I  would  hope  that  you’d  take  that  on.  I  really  do.  You’ve  got  the 
capability  to  do  it,  and  I  really  think  that  somehow  or  other  we 
have to find a way to take this to the U.N. before the meeting next 
year. And I’ve been talking to some people about that. They all say 
you  have  to  have  some  facts  and  figures  to  deal  with  the  U.N.  We

27 

don’t have them. But, it’s your responsibility, Admiral, to get them 
for us. I hope you’ll find some way to do that. 

And  I’d  like  to  have  a  meeting,  a  bipartisan  meeting  with  mem-
bers of this committee and with representatives of your agency, the 
Coast Guard, and the State Department to see what we’re going to 
do about this. Because unless we wake up, there is not going to be 
a  fishery  in  the  North  Pacific  of  any  anadromous  fish.  It’s  very, 
very serious, in my opinion. 

And  look  what’s  happened  to  California.  A  lot  of  people  have 
blamed  the  California  orca.  In  Washington,  the  salmon  have  dis-
appeared.  They  didn’t  disappear  because  of  overfishing  from  the 
American side. There has been very little salmon fishing from ves-
sels  that  are  associated  with  the  harbors  along  the  West  Coast. 
That  is  the  result  of  IUU  fisheries,  in  my  opinion.  And  it’s  got  to 
stop.  Because  if  it  hits  our  fish,  the  last  remaining  sound  salmon 
fishing  in  the  world,  because  it’s  scientifically  managed  and  it’s 
really  increasing,  still  increasing  every  year,  the  returns  in  our 
state are, as you know. I hope, I just pray that you’ll find some way 
to put this task force together and get active on it, because I don’t 
see a sense of urgency in this budget. 

You  have,  in  this  budget,  reduced  the  funds  for  fishery  surveys 
to  $15  million  from  $25  million.  That’s  cancellation  of  many  of  the 
surveys, in my state, of the populations. How are we going to know 
when they hit—this reduction hits our state, unless you have those 
surveys? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Yes,  sir.  There  are  two  issues  here. 
There’s the 2008 budget, which Congress gave us with a reduction, 
and  we  are  working  through  that.  There  will  be  impact,  as  you’ve 
suggested, to some surveys all around, including ones in Alaska. 

In  2009,  we’re  asking  for  that  money  back.  So,  this—the  new 
budget  that  we’re  asking  for,  if  we  can  get  those  funds,  we’ll  be 
able  to  do  all  the  surveys  that  we  have  projected  as  being  needed 
for Alaska and for the other regions. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, that was going to be—— 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER. So, I ask for your support—— 
Senator STEVENS.—my next question—— 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER.—on that. 
Senator  STEVENS.—is  whether  or  not  the  2009  budget  really  re-

stores that. 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  You’re  saying  the  cut  that  took  place,  of  $10 

million, is replaced in 2009? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes, sir. 
Senator STEVENS. When will you start those surveys, then? 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  If  we  have  approval  from  Congress  for 
the money, we will begin them right away. And obviously we have 
a problem with the CR. If we end up with a CR that locks in some 
of  last  year’s  limits  without  some  help,  then  we  won’t  be  able  to 
do that. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, have you had any meetings yet with the 

State Department and others on the IUU problem? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  have  talked  to  the  Commandant  of 
the Coast Guard. I’ve not talked to the State Department. I will get 
with  the  Commandant  of  the  Coast  Guard  again.  And  remember

that  part  of  what  we’re  using  this  money  for  is  to  try  to  get  the 
facts  and  figures  you’re  talking  about.  They’re—that’s  not  an  easy 
project, as you’ve suggested, but I will—I take this just as seriously 
as you do, Senator, and I will work with the State Department and 
the Coast Guard to see what more we can do, sir. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you. I’d like to visit with you later 

this year about that. 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  I  am  disturbed  about  the  COBB.  Now,  this 
looks  like  provincial  concepts,  but  I  understand  that  you’re  going 
to retire the COBB, which has been the vessel that has been doing 
the  surveys  in  southeastern  Alaska,  which  is  the  most  threatened 
area of our state. And it is not going to be replaced at all. How are 
you  going  to  do  the  surveys  if  the  COBB  just  disappears  from  our 
waters? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  We  have  a  plan—or,  we’re  working  on 
a comprehensive plan, but we have—you know, we have an outline 
of  how  we  would  do  this.  Part  of  it  would  be  done  by  the  DYSON, 
and the other part will be done by shallow-draft vessels that we’re 
going to charter. 

Senator STEVENS. DYSON works north of Juneau, doesn’t it? It’s 

out of Kodiak. I’m talking about southeastern Alaska now. 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Yes,  sir.  We  have  a  plan  to  fill  in  all— 
all  of  the  surveys  that  the  COBB  does  will  be  taken  care  of,  ei-
ther—— 

Senator STEVENS. By whom? 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.—as  I  said,  some  of  them  can  be  han-
dled—a  few  of  them  can  be  handled  by  the  DYSON,  and  the  rest 
will  be  handled  by  shallow-draft  charter  vessels  or,  potentially, 
other  NOAA  vessels.  We’re  working  on  a  full-course  program.  But, 
you  remember,  the  COBB  is  59  years  old.  It  is—it’s  a  museum 
piece, at this point. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I’m  almost  85,  and  I’m  still  going.  That 

boat can keep up. 

care of, though. 

morning, as well. 

[Laughter.] 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes, sir. You’ve been much better taken 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  might  add,  you’re  going  very  well  this 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  I’ve  got  to  tell  you  that  I  understand 
what you’re saying, but it does look to me like you’re robbing Peter 
to  pay  Paul;  you’re  taking  it  out  of  the  largest  area  that  we  have 
to  cover,  which  is  the  Kodiak  area,  that’s  an  enormous  area;  the 
southeastern is the smallest area, but, I agree, it’s most pressured. 
But,  to  have  the  DYSON  come  down  from  Kodiak  to  operate  out 
of Juneau is wrong. You need more help up there, too. The species 
that  are  up  north  are  even  more  threatened  than  those  down 
south. 

I really think the threat is there now, and it’s not from pollution, 
it’s not from changes in any circumstances on land, it’s at sea. And 
unless  people  get  that  message,  I  think  we’re  going  to  be  in  real 
trouble.  The  chairperson  right  now,  with  the  Seattle  interests,  has 
as much or greater interests in what goes on in southeastern Alas-

ka than we do. That’s most fished by boats from the Seattle region. 
But,  the  impact  of  these  IUU  fisheries  are  greater  there,  as  they 
come  out  of  the  Gulf  of  Alaska,  more  than  anywhere  in  our  state. 
I’m worried about them getting into the area—but, they don’t real-
ly  get  too  far  up  there,  where  we  have  the  closure  and  there  is  no 
open ocean between the Russian zone and ours. I’m not as worried 
about that as I am down south, where there is no active border pa-
trol,  ‘‘maritime  boundary  patrol,’’  I  should  say,  rather  than  ‘‘bor-
der.’’ 

But,  I  hope  we  can  find  some  replacement  for  COBB.  And  I  am 
disturbed; before 9/11, we had double the amount of boats we’ve got 
there  now  in  the  Coast  Guard  and  national  marine  fisheries. 
They’ve been cut in half. And that’s what’s happening to the protec-
tion  of  the  fisheries.  And  the  United  States  is  going  to  wake  up 
some  day,  half  of  the  fish  consumed  by  the  United  States  comes 
from  the  waters  I’m  talking  about.  Half  of  it.  And  we’re  increas-
ingly relying on fish products in our market, daily purchasing from 
markets.  It’s  not  going  to  be  there,  because  the  IUU  fisheries  are 
not dumping their stuff in the United States, we know that. I think 
we’ve really got to wake up. 

Last, we have some necessity to look at the concept of expanding 
some  sanctuaries  for  fisheries  off  our  shores.  Are  you  looking  at 
that? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes, sir. I was asked to comment in my 
testimony,  which  I  did  earlier,  to  talk  about  boundary  expansions 
for the Thunder Bay and the Gulf of Farallones and one other Cali-
fornia—— 

Senator STEVENS. I didn’t read that in connection with my state. 

Where are you talking about? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.—we  were  talking  about  one  that’s  in 
the Great Lakes, and we’re talking about two that are basically in 
the San Francisco area, off—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  You’re  not  talking  about  looking  at  protecting 

the area of the Aleutian chain that goes out there 2,000 miles. 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.—no,  sir,  we’re  not  talking—I’m  not 
talking  about  any  of  that.  This—the  comments  on  this  hearing 
have been directed toward expansion of the National Marine Sanc-
tuaries,  two  of  them  off  the  coast  of  California,  and  one  of  them— 
I think it’s in—— 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  most  people  don’t  realize  that  it’s  2,000 
miles. You go out that chain, all the way out, and south of that we 
have 200 miles, but that abuts the great Gulf of Alaska. And that’s 
where  they  are  now,  that’s  where  those  vessels  are  coming  now.  I 
don’t  think  we’ve  apprehended  but  one  in  this  whole  period.  Now, 
I  do  think  that  we  have  to  find  some  way  to  form  an  alliance.  I’m 
getting redundant. But IUU fisheries are the greatest threat to our 
fisheries in the North Pacific today. 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER.—yes, sir. 
Senator  STEVENS.  And  we  can’t  manage  them  through  our  re-
gional council. We can’t even affect what they do outside that line. 
So, I hope you’ll help us. 
Thank you very much. 
Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Senator Stevens. And thank you 
for  your  comments,  both  from  the  perspective  of  Alaska  and  cer-

tainly  the  Northwest  overall.  And  we  certainly  agree  that  a  lot 
more  attention  needs  to  be  paid  both  on  the  analysis  and  on  the 
planning side. 

And  I  don’t  know,  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  if  you  wanted  to  com-
ment  right  now  on  what  you  think  NOAA  science  is  telling  us 
about this drastic situation in the West Coast. 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Well, there are a number of issues that 
go  with  this.  First  of  all,  we’ve  talked  about  the  water  conditions, 
so the general—generally, anadromous fish depend on water condi-
tions  and  upwelling  of  nutrients  and,  basically,  the  food  chain 
that’s out there. They also depend upon the Pacific Decadal Oscilla-
tion  and  the  general—what  I  would  call  climate  change  variables 
that you look at. So, there are a lot of factors at play. 

But,  from  an  international  perspective,  the  best—we  don’t  have 
enough—when  I  talk  to  the  Coast  Guard—we  don’t  have  enough 
resources  to  go  out  and  surveil  the  whole  ocean  to  find  everyone 
that’s  doing  something  wrong.  The  best  chance  that  we  have  is  to 
ensure  that  there  is  no  market  for  those  products.  So,  if  there  is 
no  market  for  them,  we’re—we  shut  them  down,  basically.  We’re 
trying to work on ways to get inventories of what’s coming into the 
various  ports  around  the  Pacific—and  the  Atlantic,  for  that  mat-
ter—with—through  these  regional  fisheries  management  organiza-
tions  that  are  multinational  agreements  under  the  FAO  and  part 
of  international  agreements  to  stop  IUU.  I  mean,  it’s  a—that’s  the 
principle  of  the  organizations  that  work  in  these  areas.  So,  if  we 
can—we  can  get  more  information  on  what  ships  are  doing  this, 
where they’re making the transfers, and what ports they’re coming 
into,  we  can,  you  know,  gradually,  hopefully—more  than  gradu-
ally—eventually shut them down. But, that’s the task that we’re on 
now. 

But, as I said, I will talk to the Commandant of the Coast Guard 

and get his current wisdom on it at this point. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I  join  Senator  Stevens  in  saying  that 
we  have  to  be  aggressive  about  the  programs  that  you  run,  and 
have the resources to do so. So, we certainly will be looking at this 
budget  perspective  and  making  sure  that  we  actually  have  the 
planning  and  dollars.  No  one  expects  you  to  map  the  entire  ocean, 
but we do expect to have a rigorous program on this issue, and we 
certainly  think  that  coming  behind  the  problem  after  a  disaster  is 
declared,  and  having  the  Federal  Government  pay  out  resources, 
rightly  so,  is  coming  behind  the  problem,  and  so,  we  certainly  will 
want  to  see  that  this  budget  reflects  what  we  expect  it  will  take 
to protect salmon on the West Coast. 

I’d  like  to  turn  to  a  couple  of  other  issues,  if  I  could,  Admiral, 
particularly  the  NOAA  satellite  system.  And  obviously  we  have  a 
lot  of  concern  about  schedule  delays  in  that  program.  I  think,  last 
time  the  Commerce  Committee  had  a  hearing  on  this,  in  2007,  we 
were  talking  about  various  documents  and  reports  that  were  part 
of  where  we  were—the  Acquisition  Program  Baseline,  the  Acquisi-
tion Strategy Report, the Award Fee Plan, all of this, because it ob-
viously is a very complicated acquisition program, with problems in 
it,  Tri-Agency  Memorandum  of  Agreement,  Test  Evaluation  and 
Master  Plan,  all  those  were  reports  that  were  part  of  this  process. 
And  we  asked  then  when  we  could  see  those  documents  and  when

they would be completed. And at the time, they weren’t completed, 
and  I  don’t  know  if  they’re  completed  yet.  Can  you  give  us  an  up-
date on that? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  We  have  made  great  progress  in  com-
pleting  the  documents.  I  think  we’re  down  to  five,  at  this  point, 
which  I  expect  to  be  done  with  in  the  next  month.  And  I  have 
brought it up—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Those five that I just mentioned? 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.—they  include  the  Acquisition  Program 
Baseline,  the  Tri-Agency  MOA,  the  Strategy  Report,  and  the 
TEMP, which I think is signed, or close to it. 

But, there are more programs than the ones you mentioned that 
had  not  been  signed,  so  they  are—there  progress  has  been  made. 
First of all, those documents are all at a place where they’re not 
interfering,  or  not  detracting  from  our  ability  to  manage  the  pro-
gram, because they are completed to the point—with the exception 
of final review by principals in the Department of Defense. And I’m 
optimistic  that  they’ll  all  be  signed  within  4  or  5  weeks.  But, 
they’re  not  hindering  progress  on  our  ability  to  manage  the  pro-
gram. They are essentially done, with the exception of—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Well, we’ve had—but, we have had cost over-
runs,  we’ve  had  concerns—obviously,  our—this  is  a  multi-agency— 
we’ve  had  a  whole  committee  hearing  on  this,  and  obviously  many 
of  my  colleagues  showed  up  to  express  their  concern  and  frustra-
tion  about  the  multi-agency  approach  and  the  cost  overruns 
and—— 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.—we  have  put  in  a  completely  different 
management  system.  This  program  is  still  a  tri-agency  program, 
because  there  is  no  real  option  to  changing  that  at  this  point.  We 
have  put  in  the  management—a  new  set  of  management  controls. 
We  have  new  people  in  this  process.  We  are—we  can  measure 
every  time  a  pin  drops  in  this.  We  have  provided  briefings  to  the 
staff  and  any  members  who  wish  to  have  them.  The  government 
oversight  of  this  program,  starting  2  years  ago—two  and  a  half 
years  ago—has  been  improved  well  beyond  what  anybody  ever  ex-
pected  when  they  created  the  program.  It  is  on  cost.  It  is  on  cost, 
and the schedule was created after that review, which showed that 
the initial estimates were well below anybody’s likely—likely costs. 
The  current  schedule  is  being  maintained,  and  the  current  costs 
are being maintained. 

Senator  CANTWELL.—we’ve  seen  the  NPOESS  satellites  fire  out 

of control, though, from $6.5 billion to $12.5 billion. 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Six  point  five  billion  dollars,  that  was 
a number that was created from a baseline in the late 1990s. This 
is 10 years later. It was created before anybody had any experience 
in  building  the  instruments  or  in  the  acquisition  system  that  was 
installed  at  that  point  to  manage  it.  It  proved  that  that  estimate 
was  not  correct,  because  they  could  not—the  contractors  could  not 
build the instrument in accordance with the schedule and the con-
tract  that  they  signed.  You  go  back  to  the  contractor’s  making 
money. We have reduced the contractor’s fees, and we have put the 
contractor  under  a  much  stronger  leash  than  was  in  place  at  the 
time  this  program  was  started,  in  the  middle  nineties,  basically. 
There’s been significant change in the way it’s being managed, and 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

the price, we believe—this independent cost-reviewed, based on ex-
perience,  is  the  right  cost.  We  are  maintaining  that  schedule  and 
that cost at this point. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Am  I  not  correct,  Admiral,  that,  even  with 
those  problems,  that  the  contractor,  Northrop  Grumman,  received 
$123  million  in  award  fees,  even  though  they  had  cost  overruns? 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  The  process  that  was  built  into  the 
original contract was a process that allowed them to get profit. And 
it  was—I  can’t  verify  that  number,  but  they  did  receive  profit.  We 
have changed their structure—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  We’re  not  talking  about  profit,  we’re  talking 
about award fees, which are usually associated with good perform-
ance. 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER.—the way that program was set up was, 
there  was  a  series  of  milestones  and  achievements  that  they  had 
to  reach,  which  they  did.  So,  those  awards  were  legitimate  under 
the contract. And remember, these—there is only, really, one thing 
wrong  with  this  program;  it’s  the  VIIRS  instruments.  Everything 
else  is  working  fine.  So,  it’s  one  instrument  that  is  the  problem. 
But,  other  parts  of  that  contract  were  being  met  on  time  and  on 
schedule. The contract said they get an award for doing—for meet-
ing  those  milestones  on  time.  We  have  since  changed  that  so  it’s 
a much stricter system and pays more attention to the areas where 
they’re  behind,  which  obviously  are  the  ones  that  we  should  be 
more concerned about than where they’re on schedule. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So,  are  you  saying,  Admiral,  that  there  will 

be no cost overruns in the future? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  wish  I  could  sit  here  and  guarantee 
there  wouldn’t  be  any  cost  overruns  in  the  future.  I  believe  we’re 
as protected as we possibly can be. We have applied every conven-
tion  that  I  know  of  in  my  40  years,  or  that—the  independent  cost 
reviews  and  management  experts  that  we’ve  had  look  at  the  pro-
gram;  and,  as  of  right  now,  we  are  within  what—the  government 
estimates;  we  are  still  maintaining  course  and  speed  on  this  pro-
gram. 

Senator CANTWELL. So, you think the NPOESS number, that has 
moved  from  $6.5  to  $12.5  billion—you  think  $12.5  billion  is  the 
right number. 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  think  $12.5  billion  is  the  right  num-

ber. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  what  happens  if  we’re  back  here  in  an-
other year and we find out that it’s much greater than that? What 
will you say now—then about the process? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Well, I will have to know what—I can’t 
think  of  anything  now  that  would  change  this.  I  mean,  I—there 
is—you  know,  there  would  have  to  be  some  kind  of  a  catastrophe 
or something that was not—I don’t know. I was going to say, I can’t 
guarantee the future. I can tell you what happened in the past, and 
I  can  tell  you  what  we’ve  done  to  improve  it.  And  I’ve  watched 
these  acquisition  programs  for  years  and  years,  I’ve  been  an  inde-
pendent  cost  analyst  in  the  Department  of  Defense,  I’ve  managed 
programs, I’ve been a budget analyst—I’m not going to sit here and 
tell you that this is the end of the cost.

Generally  speaking,  our  satellite  programs  have  cost  at  least 
twice  as  much  as  the  original  estimate.  That’s  been  the  track 
record since the beginning of the satellite programs in 1970. So, the 
initial  estimates  are  always  optimistic,  if  you  want  to  put  it  that 
way.  We  were  always  betting  that  we  can  deliver  something  with 
a  minimum  amount  of  fuss  in  the  shortest  period  of  time,  we’re 
going to have technology that shows up at the right point. And they 
are so complicated that that has rarely proven to be the case. And 
I  don’t  see  any—I  see  that  we’re  in  the  same  situation  right  now. 
What  I’m  trying  to  do  is  make  sure  we  have  the  right  costs  in 
place. I believe, based on everything we know today, that that’s the 
right number and we can deliver it for that cost. And I also am try-
ing  to  do  that  on  the  GOES–R  program,  so  there  is  a  cost  in  the 
GOES–R  program  which  I  believe  we’re  ahead  of  the  problem, 
we’re putting the right cost in, at this point, so there won’t be this 
tendency  for  year-by-year  cost  overruns  to  occur  in  the  GOES–R 
program.  And  we’ve  taken  every  possible  lesson  learned  from 
GOES–R—or  from  NPOESS,  and  put  it  into  GOES–R  in  the  way 
the management structure is set up. And, again, it’s transparent— 
we’re making it transparent to the oversight committees, to ensure 
that everyone has the information they need as we move along. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I  would  certainly  say  that  having  a 
track  record  of  having  an  original  estimate,  and  then  having  the 
cost  to  the  taxpayer  be  twice  that  amount,  is  not  a  good  example 
to continue to follow. I think it points to problems with the acquisi-
tion  process  for  these  resources,  and  I  certainly  plan  to  look  into 
making changes in that process. 

But,  since  you  mentioned  the  geostationary  satellites,  what’s 
going  to  happen  if  Congress  pursues  a  continuing  resolution  and 
we  don’t  carve  out  something?  What’s—what  could  be  the  delay  in 
the program? What actually would be the impact? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  We  believe  that,  at  this  point,  it  would 
be at least a year delay, because this is the time when we need to 
sign  the  contracts  and  start  work  on  the—from  the  prime  con-
tractor  for  both  the  space  segment  and  the  ground  segment.  The 
contracts  have  already  been  let  for  the  instruments.  This  is  a  les-
son we learned from NPOESS. So, the contract for the instruments 
have  been  working—been  working  on  them  to  make  sure  that 
they’re  ready  for  the  satellite.  So,  if  we—if  we  have  to  stay  at  the 
same levels, we will have to slow down, substantially, either the in-
struments  or  the  space  segment.  And  we  believe  that  would  delay, 
probably,  a  year—more  than  a  year  in  the—being  able  to  launch 
the  satellite.  And  then,  that  would  be  a  risk  that  we’d  go  below— 
we  like  to  have  a  risk  of  no  greater  than—or,  no  less  than  80  per-
cent,  that  we’re—we’ll—that  we’ll  have  our  two  satellites  in  orbit 
to—as  warning  sentinels  against  severe  weather  and  other  disas-
ters. We do not like to drop below 80 percent. If we have this delay, 
caused  by  not  being  able  to  increase  the  funding,  as  we’ve  pro-
posed, that is a strong possibility. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I’m  sure  my  colleagues,  from  other 
parts  of  the  country  who  have  that  kind  of  weather  conditions 
much more frequently than we do in the Northwest, would be very 
concerned  about  that.  So,  we  certainly  want  to  make  sure  that 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

34 

we’re  doing  all  that  we  can  to  improve  the  delivery  on  this  pro-
gram. 

Let  me  turn  to  another  technology  question,  as  it  relates  to  a 
specific  issue  that  you  and  I  have  discussed  as—it’s  particular  to 
Washington  State—I  brought  it  up  in  my  opening  statement— 
about  the  extreme  damage  done  to  the  State  of  Washington  from 
hurricane-force winds that we definitely weren’t anticipating or ex-
pected.  We  certainly  get  100-mile-and-hour  winds  from  time  to 
time—or quite frequently, in the fall and winter of the year, 70- to 
80-mile-an-hour  winds,  but  this  was  something  even  above  what 
has been our historical trends. And we have discussed the fact that 
the  West  Coast,  in  this  particular  area  of  Washington  State,  prob-
ably  has  some  of  the  worst  radar  coverage  in  the  U.S.  Would  you 
agree  with  that,  Admiral,  that  we  are  less  resourced  there  than 
probably anybody else? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  would  agree  that  the  radar  coverage 
is blocked in certain areas. We put resources into Northwest Wash-
ington  as  well  as  we  do  around  the  country.  We  try  to  spread  our 
resources  where  it  makes  sense  and  to  provide  uniform  kinds  of 
coverage.  So,  I  don’t—I—we  are  not  shorting,  basically,  resources 
for the Northwest. I want to make that clear. 

Now,  I  agree  that  we  have  some  issues  there.  We’ve  worked  on 
it. We appreciate your help in supporting the meeting that we had, 
on  March  6th,  where  we  got  together  with  all  of  the  constituents, 
emergency  managers,  everyone  who  was  involved  in,  basically, 
dealing  with  this  very  severe  winter  storm,  and  I  think  we  have 
a  much  better  understanding  of  what  the  constituents  need  and 
what  we  need.  So,  we’re  working  on  improving  the  observations. 
We’re improving forecasts. And better communication and dissemi-
nation  came  out  as  an  issue.  So,  we’re  working  across  the  entire 
Weather Service to deal with that. The warning—our forecast office 
out  there  is  working  to  make  sure  that  they  have  the  right  kinds 
of connections with the emergency managers, radio stations, people 
who  can  effect  an  understanding  for  the  public  as  to  what’s  hap-
pening, and provide direct support. 

We  are  doing  a  full  assessment  of  all  of  the  services  out  there, 
from  the  headquarters  perspective,  as  to  what  we  delivered  and 
can  we  improve  on  it.  We  expect  that  to  be  done  by  end  of  the 
month. 

We are working with the FAA to incorporate the—as I mentioned 
to  you  earlier—the  data  from  its  air  route  surveillance  radar  at 
McChord  Field,  Washington,  because  that’s  a  place  where  you  can 
see down the coast with some information. So, we believe that can 
be  finished—we  can  do  that  by  the  end  of  2008,  and  have  that  in 
place, have that connection made and have that data input into the 
weather  systems.  So,  that  will  make  a—that  will  make  a  signifi-
cant difference in radar coverage. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  But,  Admiral,  could  you—beyond  that,  do 

you support improved technology solutions for that area? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Oh, yes. Yes. And we are working with 
the  University  of  Massachusetts  and  the  Collaborative  Adaptive 
Sensing—CASA program—to determine the feasibility of the small-
er radars to see what makes sense. And, in the end, we are looking 
at a—I would say, a full-court press, as I mentioned, a mixed—I’ve 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

35 

asked—directed the head of the Weather Service to look at the full 
array  of  sensors  so  we  can  provide  the  right  information—buoys 
that  are  far  enough  off  the  coast,  increasing  radar  coverage,  that 
we’ve talked about, other types of ground sensors. 

And  another  issue  that  doesn’t  come  up  real  often  in  most  other 
parts of the country is the need for localized models. That’s a very 
specialized  terrain  area.  And  so,  when  you  look  at  the  large-scale 
generalized  models,  where  you  have  a  grid  size  that’s  10  kilo-
meters,  that  doesn’t  detail  what  happens  in  that  specialized  area, 
with this rugged geometric. So, those are—those are—we are look-
ing  at  a  full-court  press  on  trying  to  deal  with  the  issues  that  re-
sulted from that storm. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  certainly  this  storm  hit  in  a  most  vul-
nerable  spot,  from  a  technology  perspective.  I  mean,  the  least 
amount  of  information  ended  up  being  the  eye  of  the  storm.  What 
funds are included in the FY09 budget to address this gap? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  We  have  the  money  in  there  for  the 
studies,  for  the  radars,  and  we  will  have  to  use  Fiscal  Year  2009 
funds  to  look  at  modernizing  if  we  have  the  results  from  the  stud-
ies that tell us what to do. We could provide buoys, and we can pro-
vide  modeling,  and  we’ll  have  to  look  at  the  cost  of  the  small  ra-
dars, which—we haven’t completed the study yet, so I can’t tell you 
what that is. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  you  think  that  can  be  done  within  the 

FY09 budget, those kinds of—— 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  think  that  some  of  it  can  be  done.  I 
don’t  think  that  all  of  it  can  be  done.  I  think  that  this  will  take 
time.  This  is  not—this  is  not  an  instantaneous  fix.  There’s—it’s 
not—there is nothing on the shelf, other than the things I’ve men-
tioned.  We  have  a  National  Data  Buoy  Center,  and  we  can—and 
we  can  schedule  installations  of  buoys  and  hook  them  up  to  the 
Net.  We  can  schedule  some  sensors.  We  can  look  at  changes  to 
models.  In  terms  of  building  radars  and  putting  in  modernized  ra-
dars,  that  takes,  normally,  several  years  to  do  that  and  complete 
it.  It’s  not  something  that  can  be  done  very  quickly.  But,  we  will 
start on it. We are committed to start on it and provide the funding 
when it’s—when we have a program that meets a sensible cost-ben-
efit analysis that you would agree to. 

Senator  CANTWELL.—well,  we  appreciate  you  continuing  to  work 
on  this  very  important  issue.  And  I  can’t  explain  to  those  who  are 
in attendance today how devastating that was to a particular area 
of  our  state,  the  flooding.  The  Coast  Guard  rescued  hundreds  of 
people  off  of  rooftops  and  everything  else.  But,  no  one  expected 
150-mile-an-hour  winds.  And  with  the  shadow  of  the  Olympic 
Mountain  Range,  it  does  cause  quite  a  bit  of  problem  in  getting 
good weather and forecast data into that region. 

A  related  issue—I’m  sticking  on  a  technology  trend  here  for  a 
second—on  the  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicles,  I  know  that  your  2009 
request includes $6.3 million to conduct UAV tests in four different 
regions:  the  Pacific,  the  Arctic,  West  Coast,  East  Coast.  So,  what 
type  of—will  those  be  ready  for  the  2008  hurricane  season?  What 
is your anticipation? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. We plan to—if the tracks are such that 
are  amenable  to  where  we  have  asset  stationed,  we  plan  to  test  it 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

36 

again  in  the  2008  hurricane  season,  yes.  So,  one  of  the  tests  will 
be for hurricanes and the others we plan for the Pacific and for the 
Arctic  area,  both  West  Coast  and  Hawaii  or  the  Central  Pacific. 
Those  tests  are  more  amenable  to  scheduling.  And  that’s  part  of 
the budget, and we will—you know, we will conduct them for 2009, 
and we have some money in 2008 that we’ll continue to expand on 
our ability to use unmanned aerial systems. 

I  think  they’re  essential  for  the  future.  They  allow  us  to  see  in 
places  that  are  remote.  Satellites  can’t  see  the  detail;  they’re  not 
low  enough  or  have  enough  fidelity.  Manned  aircraft  are  dan-
gerous;  you  can’t  maintain  the  mission  profiles  for  very  long  with-
out  incurring  a  huge  expense  because  of  the  cost  of  manned  air-
craft.  And  particularly  for  looking  at  weather  systems  that  come 
into the western part of the United States, I think that UAVs offer 
a  great  benefit,  and,  potentially,  leap  forward  for  us  to  be  able  to 
provide  better  weather  forecasting  along  the  West  Coast.  So,  we 
are very interested in making these tests. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Has  the  FAA  given  you  approval  to  do  so, 
particularly  as  it  relates  to,  you  know,  mainland  or  adjacency  to 
international waters? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  This  is—if—the  technology  is  fairly 
proven,  it’s—it  really  is  the  operational  issues  that  we  have  with 
using manned airspace and unmanned air vehicles in that airspace. 
We  are  working  with  the  FAA.  We’ve  been  able  to  get  approval  to 
do  the  tests,  so  far.  We  would  like  to  be  able  to  get  more—I  don’t 
want to say ‘‘blanket authority,’’ but more rapid response for areas 
that are not conflicting with manned aircraft. We think that’s pos-
sible off the coasts, in areas away from, obviously, airports and—— 
Senator CANTWELL. So, you have got—you have gotten authority 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.—I  don’t  have  ‘‘blanket  authority,’’  but 

for—— 

we have—— 

Senator CANTWELL.—no, but—— 
Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.—been  able  to  do  it  for  tests,  yes.  We 
have  been  able—but,  it  requires  you  to  work  closely  with—well, 
NASA helps us with the FAA, to get permission to fly these routes. 
Senator CANTWELL.—and so, have they given you specific restric-

tions? Is that what happens—— 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. They give you restrictions, and it has to 
fit  in  with  the—with  their  operations.  So,  there  are  restrictions. 
There are time and airspace restrictions that are placed on us. 

Senator  CANTWELL.—well,  this  is  an  issue  for  the  larger  com-
mittee as a whole, but we certainly—we’d like to see those restric-
tions, and we’d like to see NOAA continue to push forward on get-
ting  a  broader  authority.  We  think  it  is  critical,  both  for  weather 
and  information,  that  the  unmanned  vehicle  technology  be  used  in 
helping gather and getting us more consistent and timely informa-
tion. 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  I  agree,  and  I  will  keep  pressing  on  it. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  I’d  like  to  turn  to  a  couple  of  other  issues, 
if  I  could.  I  want  to  make  sure  this—in  your  proposed  budget,  the 
educational—NOAA education has been cut $34 million, and many 
of  the  programs  are  directed  at  scholarships  and  education  and— 
how  does  cutting  that  budget  sync  up  with  Congress’s  focus  on

science and education and the COMPETES Act and everything that 
we’re  trying  to  do,  and  yet  we’re  cutting  this  vital  element?  And, 
as you were saying in answer to Senator Stevens’ question, getting 
to  the  bottom  of  mapping  and  science  and—we  need  these  individ-
uals,  as  it  relates  to  better  science,  to  guide  our  decisions  in  man-
agement  of  fisheries.  So,  how  is—cutting  that  program  help  us  at-
tain those goals? 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Obviously it doesn’t. I’m a big supporter 
of  education  programs,  and  I  have  spent  a  lot  of  time  trying  to  re-
install them in the NOAA budget and in our planning. 

What  happens  if  the  education  budget—first  of  all,  it  has  grown 
over  the  years,  both  in  terms  of  what  NOAA  has  been  able  to  pro-
vide in its initial submission to Congress and in what Congress has 
eventually  appropriated  for  us  and  that  the  President  has  agreed. 
What we have each year is a series of educational programs which 
are,  from  the  viewpoint  of  our  leadership,  one-time  programs  that 
are  directed  toward  very  specific  items.  The  general  intent—direc-
tions  that  I’m  given  when—to  build  a  budget,  is  to  ensure  that  we 
have  competitive  processes  and  that  we  have  national  programs, 
and so that there is a broader coverage applied to it. 

To the extent that I’ve been able to get those programs through, 
that’s  where  we  are  today.  And  those  include  the  scholarship  pro-
grams that we have, which I think are very, very vital, and several 
other open grant programs that are there. I’m looking for a way to 
try  to  convert  most  of  what  happens  into  those  kinds  of  systems. 
Now,  to  help  support  building  better  agreement  on  it,  I  would 
say,  between  the  Administration  and  Congress,  we  have  asked  the 
National  Academies  to  help  us  with  a  plan,  and  give  us  priority, 
so that we can have some—what I would say, outside legitimate as-
surance that what we’re doing makes sense, and that it’s cost-effec-
tive, and that this is a—the right place to spend resources for edu-
cation.  When  that—hopefully,  that’ll  be  done  this  year—we’ll  be 
able  to  have—I  would  like  to  have  a  better  agreement  on  the 
amount  of  resources  that  we  provide  for  education,  between  Con-
gress and the Administration. I believe this foundation will help us 
with that discussion. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Could  you  talk  a  little  bit  about  the  Office 
of Response and Restoration, as it relates to oil spill capacities and 
the budget? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Yes.  OR&R,  as  we  call  it,  is  an  impor-
tant  responsibility  of  NOAA.  We  are  the  trustee  for  Federal  re-
sources in the marine environment. This is a group of experts that 
helps  with  major  disasters,  such  as  oil  spills,  chemical  spills,  and 
other  types  of  environmental  issues  that  come  up.  They  have  ex-
perts  that  help  determine  the  spread  of  oil  or  the  currents,  the 
waves;  they  work  hand-in-hand  with  the  Coast  Guard  and  the 
State cleanup responding parties to ensure that it’s done correctly, 
that  it’s  done  efficiently,  and  it’s  an  important  service  that’s  been 
termed very valuable by everyone who uses it. 

We  had,  last  year,  a  reduction  in  the—what  we  call  the  base 
funding  for  that  program,  and  so,  we  have  asked  to  restore  that 
that  this  year  in  our  program.  We’re—we  had  about  $11  million 
last year, and we’re asking for $17 million this year. This will allow 
us to be responsive to more than one event at a time, basically. Ob-

viously,  the  oil  spill  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  that  happened  this 
year  is  an  example  of  why  we  need  this  kind  of  capability,  and  I 
think it’s very important for the country. And I ask for support for 
the full amount for OR&R. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you.  Thank  you.  And  one  last  ques-
tion.  Believe  it  or  not,  I  have  several  others,  but  I  want  to  get  on 
to our second panel, and I’ll submit those—— 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. Yes, ma’am. 
Senator  CANTWELL.—in  writing.  And  if  you  could  be  as—help 
from  your  staff  to  answer  those  and  get  back  to  the  Committee, 
that would be very helpful to members. 

But,  the  orca  recovery  funding  is  of—something  that—unique 
concern  to  us.  The  recovery  plan  released  by  NOAA  this  year  says 
that the cost to actually delist them from a recovery plan would be 
somewhere  in  the  $50  million  range  over  28  years.  And  so,  right 
now the budget includes, I think, a million dollars for these—so, if 
you’re  talking  that  size  and  scale,  you  know,  over  a  20-plus-year 
period  of  time,  how  are  we  going  to—how  are  we  going  to  make 
progress? 

Admiral  LAUTENBACHER.  Well,  this  is  a—an  initial  downpay-
ment,  obviously.  When  you  look  at  those  plans,  they  are—we  gen-
erally  work  with  partnerships.  So,  in  the  areas  where  we  need  to 
look at recovering habitat and that sort of things, it becomes State, 
local,  NGO.  There  are  other  ways  and  other  parts  of  our  general 
system to help support that. Obviously, we don’t have in our budg-
et anywhere near the number that’s talked about there, but we do 
have  enough  to  get  started.  I  believe,  with  the  million  dollars  that 
we  have  in  here,  as  we  move  ahead  we’ll  be  able  to  have  a  better 
handle  on  this  rough  estimate  of  $50  million  and  what  it  would 
take  to  do  it.  And  our  plan  is  to  continue  to  work  on  this  program 
and  ensure  that  we  put  absolutely  as  much  as  we  can  against  the 
recovery plan. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  so,  you  would  think—I  mean,  cer-
tainly—I don’t think the orca population can tolerate a 50-year re-
covery  plan.  I’m  not  even  sure  it  can  sustain  the  28  years  that 
we’re  looking  at.  So,  you’re  saying  that  this  initial  $1  million  is 
more  a  reflection  of  the  need  to  get  your  arms  around  the  various 
aspects  of  the  program,  and  that  next  year  we  might  see  a  more 
robust number. 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. I’m—that is our plan. Our plan is to try 
to  learn  more  about  what  we  can  do  with  a  million,  what  it  takes, 
and see if there are other options, other ways to get the resources, 
and  more  definitive—more  definition  of  what  those  resources  are 
and  who  might  provide  them,  or  when  they  need  to  be,  you  know, 
enacted or in—— 

Senator CANTWELL. But, given—— 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER.—in play. 
Senator  CANTWELL.—I  don’t  know  who  came  up  with  the  initial 
$50  million  in  costs,  but  you  would  agree  that  having  $50  million 
over 28 years, and starting with $1 million this year, might not get 
us to—— 

Admiral LAUTENBACHER. It—you have to have a pretty steep pro-

file to take care of that; I do agree with that. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you.

Thank  you,  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  for  being  here  this  morning 
and  for  answering  all  of  these  questions.  We  appreciate  you  an-
swering  additional  ones  that  might  be  submitted,  not  only  by  the 
Chair, but by other members of the Committee. 

But, we, as you can see from my colleagues who did attend, have 
great  concern  about  the  budget  impacts,  from  a  fisheries  manage-
ment  perspective,  as  well  as  some  of  the  other  resources  that  we 
count on from NOAA to maintain a pristine maritime environment 
in  the  various  regions  of  our  country,  and  to  continue  to  manage 
the  resources  of  the  habitats  that  are  there.  So,  we’ll  look  forward 
to  continuing  to  work  with  you  on  those  particular  problems,  and 
to try to drive these numbers to actually meet the goals that NOAA 
has set. 

So, we thank you, again, for being here today. 
Admiral LAUTENBACHER. And thank you, Madam Chair. I appre-

ciate your support. Thank you. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So,  we’ll  turn  now  to  the  second  panel  that 
we  have  this  morning,  which  is—if  they  could  make  their  way  to 
the  front  table—we  have  with  us  Mr.  Jefferson  Gray,  who  is  the 
Superintendent  of  the  Thunder  Bay  National  Marine  Sanctuary; 
Dr. Susan Williams, who is the Director of the Bodega Bay Marine 
Laboratory, University of California; and Ms. Kathy Fosmark, who 
is  Co-Chair  of  the  Alliance  of  Communities  for  Sustainable  Fish-
eries. 

So, welcome, to all. Thank you for being here today to talk about 

marine sanctuary expansion issues, these specific proposals. 

So,  Mr.  Gray,  I  think  I’m  going  to  start  with  you.  And  if  you 
can—turn  on  your  microphones,  pull  them  up  close,  and  we  would 
appreciate  it  if  you  could  keep  your  comments  to  5  minutes,  and 
we’ll  go  down  the  line.  And  then,  after  the  end  of  each—after  the 
end of all presentations, then we’ll have some questions. 

But, again, thank you for being here, and welcome. 

STATEMENT OF JEFFERSON GRAY, SUPERINTENDENT, 

THUNDER BAY NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY 

AND UNDERWATER PRESERVE 

Mr. GRAY. Good morning. And, Madam Chairman, thank you for 
having  us  here—and  the  distinguished  members  of  the  Sub-
committee staff. 

My  name  is  Jefferson  Gray.  I  am  the  Superintendent  of  the 
Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve 
located in Alpena, Michigan. Thank you for the opportunity to tes-
tify  on  Senate  bill  2281,  the  Thunder  Bay  National  Marine  Sanc-
tuary and Underwater Preserve Boundary Modification Act. 

Designated  in  2000,  the  sanctuary  provides  long-term  protection 
and  management  to  a  nationally  significant  collection  of  ship-
wrecks  and  other  maritime  heritage  resources.  NOAA  agrees  with 
the underlying purpose of the bill, which is to provide Federal pro-
tection to the maritime heritage resources located off of Michigan’s 
Presque  Isle  and  Alcona  Counties  by  incorporating  them  into  the 
existing sanctuary. 

The  proposal  has  widespread  support  in  the  local  communities. 
In May of 2000, the Thunder Bay Sanctuary Advisory Council rec-
ommended  expending  the  sanctuary  3,662  square  miles  to  an  area

extending between those two counties and all the way to the inter-
national border with Canada. 

Formal  support  for  sanctuary  expansion  has  been  received  from 
seven  local  units  of  government.  This  is  not  surprising,  given  the 
success  we’d  had  matching  the  sanctuary,  building  strong  partner-
ships  in  Michigan,  and  the  sanctuary’s  positive  influence  on  local 
communities. One example of that positive influence is the opening 
of  the  Great  Lakes  Maritime  Heritage  Center,  which  is  our  visitor 
center  and  research  center,  by  converting  a  brownfield  site  into  a 
green  building,  which  was  recently  certified  gold  by  the  LEED® 
certification,  as  well  as  the  biodiesel  vessels,  that  we  mentioned 
earlier, operate out of Alpena. 

The  bill  would  expand  the  sanctuary  approximately  eight  times 
from its current size, of 448 square miles. The sanctuary shoreline 
would  increase  from  95  to  225  miles,  and  would  include  the  cities 
of Alpena, Harrisville, and Rogers City. 

Under  this  proposal,  five  State  parks,  seven  lighthouses,  and  a 
lifesaving  station  would  be  adjacent  to  the  expanded  sanctuary. 
More than 200 shipwrecks rest within this proposed area. Magnifi-
cently  preserved  by  Lake  Huron’s  cold  freshwater,  these  archae-
ological sites are one of the Nation’s best-preserved and historically 
significant  collection  of  shipwrecks.  From  pioneer  steamers  to  ma-
jestic schooners to modern freighters, these sites represent a micro-
cosm  of  maritime  heritage  on  the  Great  Lakes.  Memorials  to  the 
men  and  women  that  worked  and  died  on  the  inland  seas,  these 
unique  sites  have  a  tremendous  historical,  archaeological,  and  rec-
reational  value.  They  not  only  connect  us  with  the  past,  but  they 
connect  us  to  the  Great  Lakes,  one  of  the  Nation’s  most  precious 
natural resources. 

The  bill  would  add  important  protection  to  a  nationally  signifi-
cant  collection  of  maritime  heritage  resources  that  are  vulnerable 
to  human  and  natural  impacts.  This  proposal  has  received  wide-
spread  support  in  the  communities,  as  it  would  highlight  these  re-
sources  and  provide  additional  opportunities  for  tourism  and  eco-
nomic growth. 

It’s  important  to  note  that  NOAA’s  currently  undergoing  man-
agement  plan  review  for  the  existing  sanctuary.  During  the  initial 
scoping  conducted  as  part  of  this  process,  significant  public  com-
ment  was  received  in  support  of  expansion.  As  noted  earlier,  the 
Advisory Council, which advises the sanctuary superintendent dur-
ing  management  plan,  passed  a  resolution  recommending  that  the 
sanctuary  be  expanded  as  soon  as  feasible.  While  there  is  public 
support  for  expansion,  as  a  general  matter,  NOAA  prefers  to  see 
significant  actions  such  as  these  vetted  through  public  manage-
ment  and  regulatory  processes  rather  than  legislatively.  Again, 
NOAA supports the intent of the bill and looks forward to working 
with the Committee as the bill moves forward. 

Thank you, again, for this opportunity.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFFERSON GRAY, SUPERINTENDENT, THUNDER BAY 

NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY AND UNDERWATER PRESERVE

(NOAA)  Thunder  Bay  National  Marine  Sanctuary  and  Underwater  Preserve  (Sanc-
tuary).  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  S.  2281,  the  Thunder  Bay  Na-
tional Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve Boundary Modification Act. 

The Sanctuary was designated in October 2000 for the purposes of providing long- 
term  protection  and  management  to  the  conservation,  recreational,  research,  edu-
cational,  and  historical  resources  and  qualities  of  a  nationally  significant  collection 
of  shipwrecks  and  other  maritime  heritage  resources  in  the  area.  Along  the  lines 
of  the  maritime  heritage  resource  protection  goals  of  the  Sanctuary,  NOAA  agrees 
with  the  underlying  purpose  of  S.  2281,  which  is  to  provide  Federal  protection  to 
the  shipwrecks,  and  other  maritime  heritage  resources,  located  off  Michigan’s 
Presque Isle and Alcona Counties by incorporating them into the Sanctuary. 

This proposal has widespread support in the local communities. On May 22, 2007, 
the  Thunder  Bay  Sanctuary  Advisory  Council  (SAC)  recommended  expanding  the 
Sanctuary  to  a  3,662-square-mile  area  extending  from  Alcona  County  to  Presque 
Isle County, east to the international border with Canada. Formal support for sanc-
tuary expansion has been received from the City of Alpena, Alpena County, Alpena 
Township,  Sanborn  Township,  Presque  Isle  Township,  the  City  of  Rogers  City, 
Alcona  County,  Michigan  Sunrise  Side  Travel  Association,  and  the  Sunrise  Side 
Coastal Highway Management Council. 

Support  for  Sanctuary  expansion  should  not  be  surprising  given  the  success  we 
have  had  in  managing  the  Sanctuary,  building  a  strong  partnership  with  the  State 
of  Michigan,  and  having  a  positive  influence  on  the  local  community.  Here  are  just 
a few of NOAA’s recent accomplishments: 

The ribbon cutting for the Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Trail took place at the 
seventh annual Thunder Bay Maritime Festival in July 2007. The trail offered dock-
age  for  visiting  tall  ships  and  allowed  visitors  to  the  festival  to  tour  the  tall  ship 
HIGHLANDER SEA. As part of the Sanctuary’s education mission, twenty full-color 
historic  markers  are  being  developed  to  interpret  shipwrecks,  lumber  mills,  dock 
remnants, historic waterfront buildings and Great Lakes shipping to create a broad-
er maritime heritage context for the sanctuary’s shipwrecks. 

NOAA  sponsored  the  Great  Lakes  Regional  Remotely  Operated  Vehicle  (ROV) 
building  competition  in  April  2007.  The  contest  featured  12  teams  of  high  school 
students  vying  for  a  spot  at  the  Marine  Advanced  Technology  Education  Center’s 
international  ROV  competition  in  St.  John,  Newfoundland.  The  Great  Lakes  Home 
School—first time competitors from Wolverine, Michigan—took first place at the re-
gional  event,  and  finished  sixth  overall.  The  competition  is  designed  to  inspire  the 
next  generation  of  underwater  scientists  and  explorers  to  pursue  careers  in  marine 
fields. 

Sanctuary staff recently finished digitizing one of the Nation’s largest archives of 
19th-century  Great  Lakes  vessel  data  and  maritime  history  documents.  Volunteers 
contributed 3,500 hours to digitizing 15,000 Great Lakes vessel files. Digitization is 
the first step toward making the information searchable and useful for research and 
conservation  purposes.  The  files  are  housed  in  Alpena  County’s  George  N.  Fletcher 
Public  Library,  where  staff  are  developing  a  searchable  interface  for  the  collection 
that  will  allow  users  to  retrieve  information  using  the  Michigan  Electronic  Library 
or Internet search engines. 

In 2007, the Sanctuary’s Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center in Alpena, Michi-
gan,  was  presented  with  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Federal  Energy  Saver  Award. 
The  purpose  of  the  award  is  to  promote  wise  energy  and  water  use  throughout  the 
Federal Government by recognizing agencies that showcase cost-effective, energy-ef-
ficient,  water-conserving  and  renewable  energy  technologies  in  their  facilities.  The 
center  is  on  track  to  becoming  a  Gold  Certified  Leadership  in  Energy  and  Environ-
mental  Design  building.  This  is  only  the  fifth  time  NOAA  has  received  the  award 
since  1995.  The  Center  not  only  serves  to  educate  the  public  about  the  significance 
of shipwrecks and maritime heritage though exhibits, but it is also the headquarters 
for  NOAA’s  Thunder  Bay  National  Marine  Sanctuary.  The  Center  also  won  a  De-
partment  of  Energy  ‘‘You  Have  the  Power’’  award  for  energy  conservation  in  2006. 
Senate  bill  S.  2281  would  expand  the  sanctuary’s  boundaries  to  approximately 
eight  times  its  current  size  of  448  square  miles.  The  sanctuary’s  shoreline  would 
also  increase  from  95  to  225  miles  and  subsequently  include  the  cities  of  Alpena, 
Harrisville and Rogers City. Under this proposal an additional five state park prop-
erties,  seven  historic  lighthouses  and  one  lifesaving  station  would  also  be  adjacent 
to the expanded boundaries. 

More than 200 shipwrecks rest within the proposed expansion area. Magnificently 
preserved  by  the  cold  freshwater  of  Lake  Huron,  these  archeological  sites  are  one 
of  the  Nation’s  best-preserved  and  historically-significant  collections  of  shipwrecks. 
From  pioneer  steamers  to  majestic  schooners  to  modern  freighters,  these  sites  rep-
resent  a  microcosm  of  maritime  commerce  on  the  Great  Lakes.  Memorials  to  the

men  and  women  that  worked  the  inland  seas,  these  unique  sites  have  tremendous 
historical,  archaeological,  and  recreational  value.  They  not  only  connect  us  to  the 
past, but they also connect us to the Great Lakes—one of our most precious natural 
resources. 

NOAA  agrees  that  S.  2281  would  add  important  protection  to  nationally  and 
internationally  significant  maritime  heritage  resources  that  are  vulnerable  to 
human  impacts  and  invasive  species.  This  proposal  has  also  received  widespread 
support in local communities, as it would highlight these resources and provide ad-
ditional  opportunities  for  tourism  and  economic  growth  in  Northeastern  Michigan. 
It  is  also  important  to  note  that  NOAA  is  currently  undergoing  a  management 
plan  review  for  the  existing  Sanctuary.  During  the  initial  public  scoping  that  was 
conducted  as  part  of  this  process,  significant  public  comment  was  received  in  favor 
of sanctuary boundary expansion. As noted above, the Thunder Bay SAC, which ad-
vises the Sanctuary Superintendent during management plan review, passed a reso-
lution that recommended the sanctuary be expanded as soon as feasible. While there 
is  public  support  for  such  an  expansion,  as  a  general  matter  NOAA  prefers  to  see 
that  significant  actions  such  as  these  be  vetted  through  public  management  plan 
and regulatory development processes rather than legislatively, as S. 2281 would do. 
Again,  NOAA  supports  the  intent  of  S.  2281  and  looks  forward  to  working  with 

the Committee as the bill moves forward. 

Thank you for this opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Gray. 
Dr.  Williams,  welcome  to  the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  being 

here. 

STATEMENT DR. SUSAN L. WILLIAMS, PROFESSOR OF 

EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY; DIRECTOR, BODEGA MARINE 

LABORATORY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS 

Dr.  WILLIAMS.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  I  am  Professor  at  the 
University  of  California  at  Davis,  and  I  am  the  Director  of  the 
Bodega Marine Laboratory. I appear before you as an independent 
marine scientist with over 30 years of experience. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  You  might  pull  that  just  a  little  bit  closer. 
Dr. WILLIAMS. It should—— 
Senator  CANTWELL.  There  you  go.  There  you  go.  Now  you’re—— 
Dr. WILLIAMS.—hello? 
Senator CANTWELL.—perfect. 
Dr. WILLIAMS. OK, thank you. 
I have been involved in the review—public review process for the 

proposed sanctuary expansion since 2002. 

I  wish  to  emphasize  three  points  in  my  remarks.  First,  the  Gulf 
of  the  Farallones  and  the  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanc-
tuaries  lie  within  one  of  the  most  productive  and  unique  marine 
ecosystems on Earth, the California Current Upwelling Ecosystem. 
It’s one of only four coastal upwelling ecosystems on Earth, and the 
only  one  of  its  kind  in  the  United  States.  These  upwelling  eco-
systems cover only 1 percent of the ocean’s surface, but are respon-
sible for 20 percent of the world’s fish catch. 

Second,  an  integral  piece  of  this  unique  ecosystem  lies  unpro-
tected  outside  the  existing  boundaries,  and  this  area  includes  the 
wellspring for life in the downstream sanctuaries. And without pro-
tecting  this  expansion  area,  the  marine  life  in  the  existing  sanc-
tuaries is put at risk. The rich food produced in this upwelling eco-
system supports a diverse assemblage of local and migratory life in 
the  sanctuaries  and  in  the  expansion  area.  For  example,  one-third 
of the world’s whale and dolphin species, including the highest con-
centration  of  endangered  blue  whales  on  Earth;  the  largest  con-
centration  of  breeding  seabirds  in  the  continental  U.S.;  over  200

species  of  fishes,  including  threatened  rockfish  and  salmon;  com-
mercial seafood species such as Dungeness crab and abalone; bam-
boo  corals,  which  provide  invaluable  record  of  climate  change.  Sci-
entific  research  has  demonstrated  that  the  expansion  area  from 
Point  Arena  to  Bodega  Bay  is  consistently  the  most  productive  re-
gion in the entire ecosystem, and thus, is vital to protect. 

New  research  has  demonstrated  that  the  expansion  area  is  the 
wellspring for the sanctuaries. It generates their source waters, nu-
trients,  and  food.  And  this  computer  simulation  demonstrates  that 
the  area  in  Point  Arena  provides  the  source  water  nutrients  and 
food  for  the  areas  downstream,  which  include  the  sanctuaries. 
These data come from the Bodega Marine Lab’s Coastal Ocean Ob-
serving System. 

So,  this  expansion  area  is  also  a  documented  hotspot  of  fish  and 
bird diversity and abundance, and a critical habitat for endangered 
whales, threatened sea lions, vulnerable fur seals, and fishery spe-
cies such as the Dungeness crab, rockfish, and sole. In fact, biologi-
cal resources in certain areas in the expansion area are richer than 
in  the  sanctuaries  themselves.  H.R.  1187  will  protect  the  source 
waters  for  this  phenomenal  marine  life  downstream  in  the  sanc-
tuaries. The public review process has been exceptionally thorough, 
starting in 2001 and before, and the Act has broad support. 

The  threats  are  real.  Oil  spills  have  occurred;  most  notably,  the 
COSCO BUSAN spill in November 2007. Importantly, this bill pro-
tects  fishes  and  does  not  change  existing  fishery  regulations,  so  it 
has  received  the  support  of  the  Pacific  Coast  Federation  of  Fisher-
men’s  Associations  and  the  Local  Bodega  Bay  Fishermen’s  Mar-
keting Association. 

In conclusion, the whole is only as good as the sum of the parts. 
H.R.  1187  will  protect  the  breadbasket,  the  food  pipeline,  which  I 
attempted  to  show  in  the  computer  simulation,  and  the  biological 
hotspots  in  the  expansion  area,  as  well  as  the  downstream  sanc-
tuaries.  Without  this  protection,  the  life  in  the  sanctuaries  is  at 
risk. 

I thank the Committee, and I would be happy to provide any fur-

ther assistance in your deliberations.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  SUSAN L.  WILLIAMS,  PROFESSOR OF EVOLUTION AND 
ECOLOGY,  DIRECTOR OF THE BODEGA MARINE LABORATORY,  UNIVERSITY OF CALI-
FORNIA, DAVIS 
As  a  marine  scientist  with  over  30  years  of  experience,  I  have  a  special  interest 
in  preserving  the  cleanest,  most  pristine  and  bountiful  waters  of  our  planet.  It  is 
important  for  researchers  like  me  to  be  able  to  observe  marine  life  in  healthy  and 
intact  ecosystems.  As  a  scientist,  I  know  that  the  healthiest  ecosystems  need  to  be 
protected  to  ensure  the  survival  of  threatened  and  endangered  marine  species  and 
commercially  valuable  species.  As  a  Professor  who  teaches  Marine  Biology  to  non- 
science  majors,  it  is  equally  important  to  be  able  to  show  students  living  examples 
of magnificent species such as blue whales. The Sanctuary expansion areas in H.R. 
1187  serve  these  purposes,  and  in  my  testimony  I  wish  to  mainly  address  the 
science behind the need to include these areas in the Marine Sanctuary system. 

I wish to emphasize three points in my remarks: 

1.  The  existing  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  the  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine 
Sanctuaries  lie  within  one  of  only  four  coastal  upwelling  ecosystems  on  Earth, 
and  the  only  one  in  the  United  States  (the  California  Current  Upwelling  Eco-
system); upwelling ecosystems are the most productive ocean ecosystems.

2. H.R. 1187 will protect the source of the water, nutrients, and food and critical 
habitats  for  the  exceptionally  diverse  marine  life  that  resides  in  or  utilizes  the 
Sanctuaries,  including  fisheries  species,  endangered  or  threatened  species,  spe-
cies  important  to  understanding  global  climate  change,  and  the  oceanographic 
processes  that  influence  the  weather.  Without  protection  for  the  northern  half 
of  the  California  Current  Upwelling  Ecosystem,  marine  life  within  the  existing 
Sanctuaries is placed at risk. 
3.  Public  support  for  the  Sanctuaries  boundary  modification  has  been  excep-
tional over the lengthy review process. 
Below, I will address each point in detail. 
1.  The  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  lie 
within one of the most productive ocean ecosystems on Earth: the California Current 
Upwelling  Ecosystem.  The  California  Current  Upwelling  System  is  one  of  only  four 
coastal  upwelling  ecosystems  on  Earth  and  it  is  the  only  coastal  upwelling  eco-
system  in  the  United  States.  Upwelling  systems  are  collectively  responsible  for  20 
percent  of  the  total  world  fish  catch,  even  though  they  occupy  less  than  1  percent 
of  the  total  area  of  the  world’s  oceans  (Cushing  1969,  Bakun  and  Parrish  1982, 
Botsford et al., 2003). 

Upwelling  ecosystems  worldwide  are  defined  by  special  oceanographic  processes 
that  lead  to  exceptional  biological  productivity.  In  response  to  winds  blowing  over 
the ocean, shallow sunlit waters are fertilized with nutrients welled up from deeper 
colder waters. The nutrients stimulate the growth of the microscopic marine plants 
(phytoplankton)  at  the  base  of  open  ocean  food  webs,  resulting  in  dense  concentra-
tions  of  food  for  marine  animals.  The  upwelling  in  the  area  from  Point  Arena  to 
Bodega  Bay  to  be  included  in  the  modified  boundary  is  known  to  be  the  most  in-
tense upwelling in North America (see below). 

2.  H.R.  1187  will  protect  the  source  of  the  water,  nutrients,  and  food  and  critical 
habitats for the exceptionally diverse marine life that resides in or utilizes the Sanc-
tuaries,  including  fisheries  species,  endangered  or  threatened  species,  species  impor-
tant  to  understanding  global  climate  change,  and  the  oceanographic  processes  that 
influence weather. 

below. 

The  scientific  justification  for  the  expansion  is  well-founded  and  summarized 

A  critical  center  of  upwelling—providing  the  source  waters  for  the  Gulf  of  the 
Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries downstream—lies outside 
of  the  existing  boundaries.  The  proposed  2093  square  nautical  mile  expansion  from 
Point Arena to Bodega Bay includes this critical upwelling center. Deep, cold, nutri-
ent-rich water wells up to the ocean’s surface at Point Arena and flows to the south 
and into the existing National Marine Sanctuaries (Largier et al. 1993, Kaplan and 
Largier 2006, Kuebel-Cervantes and Allen 2006), initiating and fertilizing blooms of 
the  marine  plants  along  the  way  and  supporting  organisms  at  all  higher  levels  of 
the food web. Figure 1 shows ocean currents moving downstream from Point Arena 
south to the present Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanc-
tuaries. The upwelling leads to such a great abundance of food that many top preda-
tors,  including  marine  mammals  and  great  white  sharks,  can  thrive  in  the  region. 
The  area  to  be  included  within  the  modified  boundary  (Point  Arena  to  Bodega 
Bay) is not only the source of water, nutrients, and food for the existing Sanctuaries, 
but  it  also  consistently  generates  the  most  intense  upwelling  in  North  America. 
Ocean production is positively correlated with upwelling intensity: the more intense 
the  upwelling,  the  more  productive  the  ocean.  The  intensity  of  the  upwelling  from 
Point  Arena  to  Bodega  Bay  is  characterized  according  to  NOAA’s  upwelling  index: 
http//www.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/PFEL/modeled/indices/upwelling/NA/dailyl 
upwell-graphs.html#p09daily.gif.  Cold  water  is  also  an  indication  of  upwelling 
strength.  Figure  2  shows  water  temperatures  are  coldest  around  Point  Arena,  also 
signifying the intensity of the upwelling. 

The rich food generated by the upwelling provides a feast for a diverse assemblage 
of  local  and  migratory  marine  life  in  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank 
National  Marine  Sanctuaries.  Overall,  the  California  Current  Upwelling  Ecosystem 
supports more than one-third of the world’s whale and dolphin species in the region 
between  Bodega  Bay  and  Monterey  Bay  (Keiper  et  al.,  2005).  The  Gulf  of  the 
Farallones has the largest concentration of breeding seabirds in the continental U.S. 
(12  species)  and  is  home  to  five  species  of  seals  and  sea  lions.  Thirty-six  species  of 
marine  mammals  migrate  through  the  Sanctuary  where  they  feed  on  the  rich  food, 
as  do  163  species  of  birds.  The  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuary  is  home 
to  at  least  240  fish  species,  69  species  of  seabirds,  and  28  marine  mammal  species, 
with other species migrating through. The nearshore fish community includes many

commercially  valuable,  but  also  threatened,  species  of  rockfish,  lingcod,  and 
greenling. 

In the fall, a species of seabird (sooty shearwater) migrates from the north to the 
south  through  the  Sanctuaries  en  route  to  South  America  and  to  New  Zealand, 
which  protects  the  shearwaters  as  important  elements  of  indigenous  Maori  culture. 
The  shearwaters  are  so  numerous  that  the  flocks  resemble  smoke  over  the  ocean’s 
surface. 

Black-footed albatross migrate between their feeding ground on Cordell Bank and 

their nesting sites on Midway Atoll in the central Pacific. 

Humpback  and  blue  whales,  both  endangered  with  extinction,  feed  on  the  rich 
abundant  food  in  the  Sanctuary  waters,  generated  by  the  upwelling.  The  blue 
whales  utilizing  these  waters  represent  the  largest  concentration  of  this  species  on 
Earth. 

This highly productive marine ecosystem also gave rise to the oldest known coast-
al human settlement in northern California (at Duncan’s Landing), which was dated 
at 8,600 years (Kennedy et al., 2005). 

Mobile  marine  species  cross  over  from  the  Sanctuaries  to  utilize  critical  habitat 
that  lies  unprotected  in  the  expansion  area.  The  expansion  area  hosts  diverse  popu-
lations  of  local  and  migratory  fishes,  birds,  and  marine  mammals,  which  are  at-
tracted to the rich food, in a very similar manner to the areas protected in the exist-
ing Sanctuaries. 

NOAA’s Biogeography Program (NOAA 2003) revealed that the area to be included 
in  the  modified  boundary  in  fact  has  in  some  cases  even  richer  biological  resources. 
‘Hotspots’  for  high  species  diversity  and  high  abundances  of  fishes  and  birds  were 
identified  within  the  expansion  area.  Some  of  the  highest  habitat  suitability  for  the 
following  species  extends  north  of  the  boundary:  commercial  fish  species  (juvenile 
bocaccio,  dover  sole  adults  and  juveniles,  rockfish,  Dungeness  crab),  harbor  seals, 
Risso’s  dolphin  (seasonally).  Two  sites  near  Point  Arena  remain  major  winter  haul 
out  areas  for  the  diminishing  population  of  Steller  sea  lions  (threatened).  The  area 
visited  most  by  gray  whales  occurred  between  Fort  Ross  and  Point  Arena,  outside 
the  existing  boundaries.  Similarly,  the  seasonal  high  use  area  for  the  northern  fur 
seal  (conservation  status:  vulnerable)  was  just  to  the  north  and  west  of  the  Sanc-
tuaries. 

Resident  species  in  the  expansion  area  include  rockfish,  lingcod,  flatfish,  Dunge-
ness crab, sea lions, seals, and seabirds. Coastal seabirds and migratory shorebirds 
using  the  Pacific  flyway  frequent  this  stretch  of  coast.  Secluded  stretches  of  coast 
offer  haul  out  areas  for  harbor  seals  and  Steller  sea  lions  (threatened)  as  well  as 
nesting sites for many species of local seabirds. Gray whales pass through this cor-
ridor  during  their  annual  migration  between  breeding  areas  in  Mexico  and  feeding 
grounds  in  Alaska.  Other  migratory  species  visiting  the  area  seasonally  to  forage 
in  the  food-rich  waters  include  endangered  and  threatened  species  such  as  hump-
back  and  blue  whales,  northern  fur  seals,  coho  salmon,  black-footed  albatross  and 
leatherback  sea  turtles.  Chinook  or  king  salmon  from  northern  California  water-
sheds also frequent this area in spring and summer to feed on shrimp-like krill, an-
chovies, and sardines. 

In  addition  to  fishes,  birds,  and  marine  mammals,  extensive  underwater  forests 
of  kelp  (a  giant  seaweed)  grow  close  to  shore  in  the  expansion  area,  where  they 
serve  as  a  critical  nursery  grounds  for  rockfishes.  The  kelp  forests  also  support 
thriving  populations  of  commercially  valuable  red  sea  urchins  and  red  abalone 
(Karpov  2001,  Rogers-Bennett  2003).  The  red  abalone  are  abundant  enough  for  an 
active recreational fishery, the only remaining abalone fishery on the west coast. 

Species  of  ancient  deep-sea  corals  (bamboo  corals)  also  live  throughout  the  region 
and  provide  scientists  with  clues  to  climate  change.  The  corals  lay  down  growth 
rings like trees, providing incomparable records of past climate conditions (Roark et 
al.,  2005).  In  addition  these  corals  provide  important  habitat  for  deep-sea  fishes. 
These  corals  are  structurally  fragile  and  susceptible  to  disturbance  from  oil  and 
mineral exploration and extraction. 

The  Bodega  Canyon  lies  within  the  modified  boundary  of  the  Cordell  Bank  Na-
tional  Marine  Sanctuary  and  is  a  specialized  habitat  for  a  variety  of  species.  The 
Bodega  Canyon  is  one  of  several  submarine  canyons  along  the  west  coast.  Cutting 
into  the  continental  shelf,  these  canyons  are  critical  conduits  for  transporting  or-
ganic matter that provisions deep-sea animals (Vetter 1995). The steep walls of the 
canyons support a diverse assemblage of marine species including deep-water corals. 
Small shrimp-like animals (‘zooplankton’, especially the type know as ‘krill’) emerge 
from  Bodega  Canyon  every  night,  attracting  predators  that  aggregate  on  the  down 
current  side  of  submarine  canyons  to  feed  (Chess  1989).  Krill  is  an  important  link 
in the Cordell Bank food web. Krill is the primary diet for blue whales and a seabird 
species  (Cassin’s  auklet)  and  a  dietary  staple  for  rockfishes,  coho  and  king  salmon.

Endangered  blue  whales  are  the  largest  animals  ever  known  and  each  day  they 
must  consume  two  tons  of  food  largely  in  the  form  of  krill.  To  maintain  this  con-
sumption  rate,  they  seek  dense  krill  aggregations.  The  krill  in  turn  depend  on  the 
algal  blooms  sustained  by  upwelling.  Krill  concentrate  downstream  of  intense 
upwelling centers, such as Point Arena, and at the edges of submarine canyons, in-
cluding  Bodega  Canyon.  California  blue  whales  predictably  can  be  found  foraging 
at  the  edge  of  submarine  canyons  (Croll  et  al.,  2005).  Protecting  these  critical  for-
aging  areas  is  important  to  securing  the  continued  survival  of  these  magnificent 
whales. 

Expanding the boundary for the Sanctuaries is crucial to achieving their manage-
ment  goal  of  protecting  the  ecosystem  for  the  marine  life  within,  as  stated  in  the 
Draft  Joint  Management  Plan.  The  expansion  area  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Cali-
fornia  Current  Upwelling  Ecosystem  which  also  encompasses  the  existing  Sanc-
tuaries. The abundant food for the species living in the Sanctuaries is produced up-
stream of the existing boundaries. And, many of the larger and mobile species travel 
outside  of  the  Sanctuaries  to  utilize  habitats  in  the  expansion  area.  Critical  parts 
of the ecosystem, such as the upwelling center at Point Arena and Bodega Canyon, 
are  not  protected  in  the  existing  Sanctuaries.  Ecosystem-based  management  has 
strong support from both scientists and the public in recognition that species do not 
live in isolation of their environment or other species, including humans. 

The  California  Current  Upwelling  Ecosystem  not  only  sustains  phenomenal  bio-
logical  productivity,  it  also  generates  weather  patterns  along  the  west  coast.  The 
thick cloud cover over the ocean and coast—the ‘marine layer’ noted by Pacific coast 
weathermen—results  from  the  cold  surface  waters  of  the  upwelling,  in  conjunction 
with the summer Pacific High Pressure System. Such clouds are known to have an 
important influence on the heat budget of Earth (Rogers et al., 1995, Faloona et al., 
2005,  Wen  et  al.,  2006).  This  thick  cloud  layer  can  be  strongly  altered  by  pollution 
and by disruption to the upwelling system. 

3.  Public  support  for  the  Sanctuaries  boundary  modification  has  been  exceptional 

over the lengthy review process. 

Since  my  appointment  as  the  Director  of  the  University  of  California’s  Bodega 
Marine Laboratory, I have personally witnessed overwhelming support for the Sanc-
tuaries  and  the  expansion.  I  have  been  involved  in  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones, 
Cordell  Bank,  and  the  Monterey  Bay  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  due  to  common 
research  and  education  interests.  The  Sanctuaries  and  the  Bodega  Marine  Labora-
tory  collaborate  on  public  education  efforts.  The  Laboratory  provides  a  neutral 
venue  for  public  meetings,  including  fishermen’s  associations  and  scoping  meetings 
for  the  Joint  Draft  Management  Plan,  and  hosts  Sanctuary-sponsored  lectures  and 
Sanctuary  Advisory  Council  meetings.  I  attend  Sanctuary  volunteer  celebration 
events.  In  addition,  I  participate  in  public  forums  and  workshops  dedicated  to  the 
science-based  management  of  California’s  ocean  resources,  as  a  charter  member  of 
the  University  of  California’s  Marine  Council  and  until  recently,  a  member  of  the 
California  Resources  Agency  Sea  Grant  Advisory  Panel.  I  interact  frequently  with 
the  public  through  these  activities,  the  students  I  teach  and  their  parents,  and 
Bodega  Marine  Laboratory’s  public  education  program,  which  reaches  up  to  12,000 
visitors  yearly.  The  public  I  have  met  who  know  about  the  Sanctuaries  consider 
them  a  national  treasure  and  are  pleased  that  Congress  is  considering  an  expan-
sion. 

Specifically,  my  direct  involvement  with  the  public  review  process  for  the  expan-

sion is as follows:

• Attended public scoping and informational meetings for the Sanctuaries and the 

• Attended  meetings  of  the  Sanctuary  Advisory  Councils,  often  hosted  by  the 

• Supervise  faculty  who  serve  on  the  Sanctuary  Advisory  Councils  and  conduct 

research in the Sanctuaries and expansion area. 

• Provide scientific advice on areas within my expertise. 
This legislation has been in the making for a long time. As early as 2001 the ex-
pansion  was  considered  in  public  scoping  hearings  for  the  Joint  Draft  Management 
Plan  for  the  three  Sanctuaries.  The  2003  release  of  the  NOAA’s  Biogeographic  As-
sessment  (see  bibliography  provided  at  the  end  of  the  written  testimony)  provided 
impetus  for  this  legislation.  The  assessment  revealed  the  inextricable  ecological 
linkages  between  the  current  Sanctuaries  and  the  expansion  area  and  that  biologi-
cal resources were in some cases richer in the expansion area. The bill was first in-
troduced  in  the  House  by  Congresswoman  Woolsey  in  2004  and  reintroduced  with 
a  companion  bill  by  Senator  Boxer  in  2005.  Congresswoman  Woolsey  reintroduced 
a  modified  bipartisan  bill  with  Congressman  Gilchrist  in  2007  and  Senator  Boxer 
introduced  the  Senate  bill  in  2008.  A  revised  version  of  H.R.  1187—the  same  bill 
that this subcommittee is now considering—passed the House in March 2008. 

Along  the  way,  public  review  and  comment  on  the  proposed  expansion  has  been 
exceptionally thorough. The bill was launched with a capacity crowd public hearing 
attended  by  scientists,  fishermen,  environmentalists,  and  members  of  the  general 
public  at  the  Sonoma  County  Board  of  Supervisors  Chambers  in  2004.  The  bill  has 
also  been  reviewed  several  times  by  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  NMS  and  Cordell 
Bank  NMS  Advisory  Councils,  the  groups  that  under  administrative  procedures, 
begin the designation process. The bill has been endorsed by both Advisory Councils. 
Additionally,  the  bill  had  a  House  Oceans  Subcommittee  informational  hearing  in 
October  2007  and  markups  by  the  Subcommittee  and  the  full  House  Natural  Re-
source Committee in March 2008. 

Additionally,  the  legislation  has  been  reviewed  and  endorsed  by  the  California 
Coastal  Commission,  the  California  State  Lands  Commission,  the  Boards  of  Super-
visors  of  Marin,  Sonoma,  San  Francisco  and  Mendocino  Counties,  the  City  of  San 
Francisco, and the Port of Oakland. All these meetings were noticed and the public 
was  given  the  opportunity  to  comment.  If  the  expansion  is  authorized,  the  public 
will  again  have  ample  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  details  of  the  expansion  as 
the regulations will be developed through the administrative process. 

The  members  of  the  California  State  Lands  Commission  include  the  Lieutenant 
Governor,  the  State  Controller  and  the  State  Director  of  Finance.  The  Commission 
has broad authority to protect lands including the state’s waterways, tidelands, and 
submerged lands. As part of its responsibilities, the Commission regulates and per-
mits  oil  and  gas  leases  and  has  comprehensive  oil  spill  prevention  programs.  In  its 
endorsement  resolution,  it  noted  the  need  to  protect  ‘‘these  currently  unprotected 
but biologically significant ocean areas in the Sanctuaries.’’

Notably,  there  is  wide  support  from  the  fishing  community  for  the  expansion. 
These  fishermen  recognize  that  protecting  the  quality  of  the  source  waters  and  the 
food pipeline for the Sanctuaries and critical fishery habitat that is currently unpro-
tected  is  important  for  sustainable  fisheries  in  the  area.  In  addition,  California 
State  Senator  Pat  Wiggins,  the  Chairwoman  of  the  Joint  Legislative  Committee  on 
Fisheries and Aquaculture having oversight over the State Department of Fish and 
Game, stated in her endorsement letter for H.R. 1187: ‘‘This bill places no additional 
restrictions  on  the  fishing  community,  so  does  not  conflict  with  existing  or  future 
regulations from our State Department of Fish and Game.’’ The Sanctuary designa-
tion  protects  fisheries  while  allowing  fishing  and  does  not  change  existing  authori-
ties for fisheries. 

This  great  public  interest  is  attracted  fundamentally  by  the  diverse  marine  life 
of  the  region  (including  iconic  species  such  as  the  California  sea  lion),  which  also 
generates an important tourism economy and serves as a hook for science education. 
The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary has attracted over 100 dedi-
cated  volunteers  a  year  in  its  beach  watch  program  alone.  The  volunteer  contribu-
tions  have  been  estimated  at  over  $200,000  worth  of  effort  annually.  The  beach 
watch  program  has  been  sustained  for  10  years,  with  more  than  90  percent  of  the 
volunteers  returning  each  year.  The  interpretive  center  in  San  Francisco  for  the 
Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary hosts over 40,000 visitors yearly. 
The expanded boundary would bring the superb public education programs of the 
National Marine Sanctuaries farther north along the Pacific coast to reach rural and 
disadvantaged children. The Sanctuaries work closely with local schools and provide 
teacher  training  for  activities  such  as  monitoring  tideline  and  beach  communities 
and  building  a  new  curriculum  that  integrates  geography  and  marine  science 
through tracking tagged migratory animals online. They also have been exceptional 
research  and  education  partners  for  institutions  of  higher  education  in  the  region. 
The  public  is  concerned  that  the  expansion  be  authorized  now  because  the  threats 

have been realized and will continue. 

The  expansion  area  and  the  California  Current  Upwelling  Ecosystem  have  been 

threatened by pollution historically and recently. 

The most environmental impact on the Sanctuaries and unprotected adjacent wa-
ters  occurred  on  November  7,  2007,  when  58,000  gallons  of  bunker  oil  spilled  from 
the  COSCO  BUSAN  and  were  dispersed  into  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  Mon-
terey Bay Sanctuaries. At first count, 2,200 birds were oiled or killed. The research 
of the environmental impacts of this spill will only add to a solid base of knowledge 
about  the  effects  of  hydrocarbons  on  marine  life  built  upon  by  scientists  in  NOAA, 
universities,  and  private  institutes  after  similar  incidents  such  as  the  EXXON 
VALDEZ oil spill. 

The COSCO BUSAN spill was presaged in the Gulf of the Farallones Draft Man-
agement  Plan,  which  cited  the  evident  risks  from  commercial  vessels  like  the 
COSCO BUSAN that draw greater than 50 feet of water and are fueled with bunker 
oil,  which  is  similar  to  crude  oil.  Additional  risks  were  cited  from  the  movement  of 
oil  tankers  carrying  an  estimated  544  million  gallons  annually  along  the  California 
coast.  In  addition  to  the  COSCO  BUSAN  spill,  there  have  been  10  vessel  oil  spills 
in  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  National  Marine  Sanctuary  since  1971  (tallied  in  the 
Gulf  of  the  Farallones  Draft  Management  Plan),  which  killed  tens  of  thousands  of 
seabirds.  The  debilitating  effects  of  oiling  sea  birds  and  marine  mammals  are  well 
known by the public. 

In the late 1970s and 1980s there were attempts to lease oil tracts off the counties 
of Sonoma and Mendocino. Congress and past Republican and Democratic Adminis-
trations  have  already  recognized  that  oil  drilling  is  inappropriate  in  this  area  and 
have placed them under moratoriums. However, the current moratorium will expire 
in  2012  and  there  have  been  efforts  to  erode  it  in  the  meantime.  Exploration  and 
extraction  activities  disturb  the  sea  floor  and  even  minute  concentrations  of  chemi-
cals  from  oil  and  mineral  extraction  (in  the  ‘production  water’)  are  toxic  to  sea  life 
including  economically  valuable  marine  species  (herring,  sea  urchins,  Pacific  oys-
ters)  that  live  in  the  Sanctuaries  and  expansion  area  (Garman  et  al.,  1994,  Krause 
1984). 

Sewage  pollution  is  another  type  of  pollution  that  threatens  the  Sanctuaries  and 
the  area  to  be  included  in  the  modified  boundary.  In  1986,  1995,  and  as  recently 
as  2003,  there  were  proposals  to  build  ocean  sewage  outfalls  along  the  Sonoma 
Coast,  and  there  was  a  massive  raw  sewage  spill  in  the  Russian  River  in  1985,  all 
just north of the existing boundary. 

More generally, the reports of the recent Pew and U.S. Ocean Commissions reflect 
broad  public  sentiment  that  our  oceans  are  under  incredible  environmental  stress 
and rapid and substantive action is required to redress the perils facing our oceans. 
Given  that  the  Pew  and  U.S.  Ocean  Commissions  agree  that  it  is  a  priority  to  pro-

tect  biologically  important  areas  and  that  there  is  ample  scientific  evidence  of  the 
value of the resources within the proposed expansion area, sound economic reasons, 
and broad public support for the expansions, it is important that Congress pass this 
legislation,  rather  than  wait  on  the  uncertainties  of  a  lengthy  administrative  des-
ignation  process.  Congress  previously  created  three  Marine  Sanctuaries.  Congress 
also directed the Secretary of Commerce to administratively designate four National 
Marine  Sanctuaries  by  specific  dates.  In  1996,  Congress  expanded  the  Flower  Gar-
den  Bank  NMS  by  adding  Stetson  Bank,  a  direct  precedent  to  H.R.  1187/S.  2635. 
In sum, Congress has had direct involvement in the designation of seven of thirteen 
National Marine Sanctuaries and expanded one National Marine Sanctuary. 

Giving  the  Sanctuary  program  authority  to  address  these  threats  and  realities 
will  help  ensure  that  these  ecologically  unique  waters  remain  clean  and  abundant 
with  marine  life.  The  Sanctuary  would  be  able  to  collect  penalties  and  settlements 
after  spills  and  dedicate  them  to  restoration  projects  in  the  expansion  area,  as  it 
has in the existing Sanctuaries. 

The  expansion  will  also  better  enable  the  Sanctuaries  to  carry  out  their  manage-
ment  goal  of  protecting  the  ecosystem  for  the  marine  life  within  by  including  the 
critical parts currently unprotected, such as Bodega Canyon and the upwelling cen-
ter  at  Point  Arena.  The  expansion  thus  also  addresses  the  U.S.  and  Pew  Ocean 
Commissions  conclusion  that  the  ocean  management  must  be  based  around  eco-
systems, rather than traditional jurisdictional boundaries; the legislation would ad-
just the jurisdictional boundary to better match the ecosystem. 

In  the  invitation  letter,  the  Committee  asked  me  to  address  the  resources  nec-
essary to carry out the expansion. It is important to fully fund the National Marine 
Sanctuaries to further protect one of the richest marine ecosystems on Earth. How-
ever, funding should not stand in the way of passing the legislation because it pro-
vides  in  itself  important  protection  for  nationally  valuable  marine  resources.  As 
stated  earlier  in  my  testimony,  the  designation  alone  allows  the  Sanctuaries  to  col-
lect fines. Potential polluters might think twice. The designation would attract com-
petitive  research  grants.  Although  it  was  a  hardship,  the  Cordell  Bank  NMS  oper-
ated  without  funding  in  the  first  few  years  of  its  designation.  The  Sanctuary  pro-
grams  have  achieved  admirable  success  in  partnering  within  the  region,  using  vol-
unteers,  and  attracting  private  donations  to  leverage  their  limited  resources.  How-
ever, additional funding is important for the Sanctuaries to fully expand its program 
and activities into new areas. 

H.R.  1187  authorizes  an  appropriation  of  $6,500,000  for  implementation  of  the 
boundary modification and such sums as necessary for construction and acquisition 
projects  for  the  Sanctuaries.  The  Congressional  Budget  Office,  as  ordered  by  the 
House Committee on Natural Resources, reported on March 12, 2008 that ‘‘enacting 
the  bill  would  have  no  effect  on  revenues  or  direct  spending.’’  The  CBO  estimated 
that  ‘‘assuming  appropriation  of  the  amounts  specified  by  the  bill  for  sanctuary 
management  or  estimated  to  be  necessary  for  authorized  construction  and  acquisi-
tion  activities’’,  implementation  would  cost  $20  million  over  the  2009–2013  period. 
The average annual appropriations to manage the two marine Sanctuaries currently 
are approximately $2 million. This small amount supports an exceptional Sanctuary 
program in management, public education, and research. 

In  summary:  Expanding  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank  National 
Marine  Sanctuaries  to  include  the  Point  Arena  upwelling  center  is  necessary  to  pro-
tect and study the source water for these two existing Sanctuaries. Nutrients and food 
produced in the Point Arena upwelling center are delivered by water currents moving 
south  to  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank.  By  expanding  the  Gulf  of  the 
Farallones and the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries north to Point Arena, 
the wellspring for the biological productivity, the food pipeline, hotspots of biological 
diversity,  and  critical  habitat  for  seabirds,  marine  mammals,  and  fisheries  species 
that range northward from the existing Sanctuaries will be protected. Expanding the 
two Sanctuaries in H.R. 1187 will help achieve the goal of ecosystem-based manage-
ment on a regional scale. 

As  a  marine  scientist  and  educator,  and  as  Director  of  one  of  the  Nation’s  oldest 
marine  laboratories  (Bodega  Marine  Laboratory)  situated  within  the  proposed 
boundary  modification,  I  find  the  ecological  uniqueness  of  the  region  a  compelling 
reason to protect the source waters and critical habitat for the marine life that fre-
quents  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuaries. 
Together,  the  area  encompasses  a  major  portion  of  the  only  coastal  upwelling  eco-
system  in  the  United  States,  which  is  one  of  only  four  on  Earth.  As  a  citizen  and 
a  resident  of  this  exceptional  and  unique  stretch  of  the  Nation’s  coast,  I  find  the 
diversity  and  abundance  of  marine  life  and  the  high  productivity  that  puts  food  on 
the table very valuable to protect now and for future generations.

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you, Dr. Williams. Thank you for your 
testimony  and  for  the  demonstration—the  interactive  demonstra-
tion. 

Ms. Fosmark, thank you for being here. 

STATEMENT OF KATHY FOSMARK, CO-CHAIR, ALLIANCE OF 

COMMUNITIES FOR SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES 

Ms. FOSMARK. Thank you. 
Madam Chair, members of the Subcommittee, for the record, my 
name  is  Kathy  Fosmark,  and  I’m  appearing  today  to  present  the 
views  of  the  Alliance  of  Communities  for  Sustainable  Fisheries  on 
H.R.  1187,  the  Gulf  of  Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank  Marine  Sanc-
tuaries Modification Act. 

The  Alliance  is  a  nonprofit  organization,  and  we  represent  18 
subgroups that range throughout the West Coast. We are basically 
representing  waterfront  communities,  and  we  work  constructively 
with  agencies  and  individuals  and  other  marine  protection  organi-
zations  in  order  to  ascertain  the—and  guarantee—that  the  best 
and current science is used. And we are here to promote public pol-
icy  and  linkage  between  healthy,  sustainable  fisheries  and  marine 
conservation. 

The Alliance and its members have extensive experience in deal-
ing  with  National  Marine  Sanctuary  Program  over  the  last  15 
years. 

On  a  personal  level,  I  am  part  of  a  multigenerational  fishing 
family that first settled in California in the 1800s. I fished commer-
cially with my father and my husband over the course of 30 years, 
and our eldest son has recently entered the fishery. Our family has 
fished  the  Pacific  Ocean  in  the  area  covered  by  these  sanctuaries,

for  tuna,  salmon,  swordfish,  crab,  Pacific  halibut,  shrimp,  and 
groundfish, using a variety of gears. 

I  am  a  member  of  the  Pacific  Fishery  Management  Council,  al-
though  I  am  not  here  representing  the  members—the  other  mem-
bers’ views. I am here representing the Alliance. 

Fishermen  don’t  oppose  marine  sanctuaries.  Fishermen  are  con-
servationists,  and  need  to  depend  on  good  science-based  manage-
ment in order to supply healthy seafood to the American consumer. 
California  fishermen  were  responsible  for  the  creation  of  these 
sanctuaries,  but  only  in  the  condition  of  a  promise  made  to  the 
fishermen. 

I will read a small excerpt from the designation document. ‘‘Fish-
ing  is  not  being  regulated  as  part  of  the  sanctuary  regime  and  is 
not  included  in  the  designation  document  as  an  activity  subject  to 
future regulation. Fisheries management will remain under the ex-
isting  jurisdiction  of  the  State  of  California  National  Marine  Fish-
ery Service and the Pacific Fishery Management Council.’’ 

Fishermen  have  come  to  distrust  the  sanctuary  program.  It  ap-
pears their decisionmaking is political instead of science-based. Re-
cently,  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  was  amended  to  ensure  the 
councils used good science. Sanctuaries need to meet the same sci-
entific  standards  as  the  Councils.  Fishermen  need  to  be  protected 
as much as resources. 

I appreciate the Committee considering the House-passed version 
of  H.R.  1187,  as  there  have  been  some  important  changes,  but  we 
have concerns about the bill, based on the promise. It doesn’t make 
it  clear  who  controls  fishing,  gives  sanctuary  authority  over  living 
marine  resources,  and  it  also  mandates  zoning,  which  is  a  par-
ticular  concern  of  ours,  as  you  have  heard  earlier,  with  the  Thun-
der Bay testimony, that that is not a situation of concern. 

Note  that  concerns  have  been  realized  from  testimony  of  Bill 
Douros  before  the  House  and  the  Monterey  National  Marine  Sanc-
tuary need-decision paper that was issued, decision on marine pro-
tected  areas  without  talking  to  the  Council.  The  Pacific  Fishery 
Management  Council  was  not  consulted  before  the  need-decision 
was  made.  This  is  why  fishermen  want  to  have  the  promise  kept. 
We cannot support the bill unless these concerns are addressed. 

Attached  is  suggested  language,  and  we’re  happy  to  work  with 

the Subcommittee to refine and improve the bill. 

Thank you.

graphic,  socio-economic  and  fisheries  science  is  accurately  compiled;  that  science  is 
readily  available  to  the  public  for  use  in  crafting  and  promoting  public  policy;  and 
that  the  linkage  between  healthy  sustainable  fisheries,  marine  conservation,  and 
coastal  communities  is  firmly  established  in  the  public  mind.  The  Alliance  and  its 
members have extensive experience in dealing with the National Marine Sanctuary 
Program over the past 15 years. 

On  a  personal  level,  I  am  part  of  a  multi-generation  fishing  family  that  first  set-
tled  in  California  in  the  1800s.  I  fished  commercially  with  my  father  and  my  hus-
band  over  the  course  of  30  years  and  our  eldest  son  now  has  entered  the  fishery. 
Our  family  has  fished  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,  including  in  the  area  covered  by  these 
Sanctuaries,  for  tuna,  salmon,  swordfish,  crab,  halibut,  shrimp,  and  groundfish 
using  a  variety  of  gear  types.  I  am  also  a  member  of  the  Pacific  Fishery  Manage-
ment  Council,  although  the  views  I  am  presenting  today  do  not  necessarily  reflect 
those  of  the  Council  or  its  other  members.  However,  I  have  attached  to  my  testi-
mony a letter from the Council to Senator Smith which provides the Council’s views 
on the bill and ask that it be included in the record. 

My  comments  will  address  H.R.  1187  as  passed  by  the  House,  as  it  is  my  under-
standing  that  this  is  the  language  the  Subcommittee  is  considering.  While  not  per-
fect—as  noted  below—we  believe  that  substantial  progress  has  been  made  on  the 
bill and that it more generally addresses many of our concerns than the companion 
Senate bill, S. 2635. 

Fishermen  do  not  oppose  the  concept  of  National  Marine  Sanctuaries.  In  fact,  it 
was  California  fishermen  who  worked  hard  to  have  both  of  these  Sanctuaries  cre-
ated.  We  recognize  that  Sanctuaries  are  designed  to  conserve  special  areas  in  the 
ocean and prevent damage to sensitive resources and habitats. 

However, when California fishermen supported creation of these Sanctuaries, they 
did so under a condition that has become popularly known as the ‘‘promise to fisher-
men’’: the Sanctuaries would not manage or otherwise regulate fisheries and fishing 
activities.  Fisheries  management  in  the  ocean  waters  off  California  is  in  the  hands 
of the Pacific Fishery Management Council. Fishermen are familiar and comfortable 
with the Council’s system of management, which is an open and transparent process 
that  is  based  on  the  best  scientific  information  available  and  that  solicits  and  re-
spects  diverse  views.  Without  that  promise,  fishermen  would  not  have  supported 
creation of the Sanctuaries. 

This is the focus of our concerns regarding the language of H.R. 1187. We appre-
ciate  the  statement  up  front  in  the  bill  (section  3(c))  that  nothing  is  intended  to 
‘‘alter any existing authorities’’ regarding fishing. Those existing authorities rest on 
the weak foundation of the Sanctuaries’ respective designation documents. They are 
regulations,  not  law.  And  as  such,  they  can  be  changed  virtually  at  any  time,  as 
we  saw  happen  over  the  last  few  years  with  the  Channel  Islands  National  Marine 
Sanctuary—an area where the promise to fishermen was broken. 

Further  reinforcing  our  concern  is  the  language  in  sections  5(a)(2)(A)(i)  and 
5(b)(2)(A)  which  includes  ‘‘living  marine  and  other  resources  within’’  the  expanded 
boundaries  of  the  Sanctuaries.  Fish  are  living  marine  resources  and  these  sections 
give the Sanctuaries clear authority over fish. Because the language regarding fish-
ing  in  section  3  is  not  clear,  the  Sanctuaries  could  easily  change  their  designation 
documents during a future management plan review such as the one required under 
section 7(b). 

We  believe  that  our  fears  of  the  Sanctuary  program  taking  a  bigger  role  in  fish-
eries  management  are  well  founded.  For  example,  last  year  Mr.  William  Douros, 
West Coast Regional Director for the National Marine Sanctuary Program, testified 
before  the  House  Committee  on  Natural  Resources  on  reauthorization  of  the  Na-
tional Marine Sanctuaries Act and emphasized the program’s role in resource man-
agement,  stating  that  ‘’the  System  is  continually  on  the  cutting  edge  of  resource 
management.’’  In  February  of  this  year,  the  Monterey  Bay  Sanctuary  announced  it 
was  moving  forward  with  designing  marine  protected  areas  ‘‘in  which  the  removal 
or  alteration  of  marine  life  is  prohibited  or  restricted’’;  in  other  words  a  marine  re-
serve.  No  discussion  on  this  issue  was  held  with  the  Pacific  Fishery  Management 
Council until April, in spite of the fact that designation of marine reserves in ocean 
waters  could  have  a  profound  affect  on  the  fisheries  managed  by  the  Council.  We 
are not opposed to fisheries conservation and management, or even to time and area 
closures  that  are  scientifically  based  and  designed  to  protect  important  fish  stocks 
and habitat. We are opposed to more and more Federal agencies arbitrarily deciding 
that they don’t want anyone to catch fish. 

Given  this  background,  we  are  opposed  to  the  language  in  section  7(e)(2)  that 
mandates establishment of zones ‘‘if necessary to ensure protection of sanctuary re-
sources.’’  While  we  can  understand  the  need  for  zoning  to  protect  important  histor-
ical  artifacts  such  as  the  wreck  of  the  S.S.  MONITOR  off  North  Carolina,  adding

this  mandate  here  reinforces  the  concern  about  Sanctuary  intrusion  into  the  realm 
of fisheries management through the use of marine protected areas. 

In  the  area  of  sport  fishing,  we  have  been  concerned  about  prohibiting  the  ‘‘de-
posit or discharge of any introduced species’’ into Sanctuary waters. The Sanctuaries 
themselves  recognize  that  there  is  a  thriving  catch  and  release  fishery  for  striped 
bass  (Morone  saxitilis)  within  the  Sanctuaries  and  the  proposed  management  plan 
changes  published  by  the  Sanctuaries  last  October  make  a  clear  exception  for  that 
fishery.  H.R.  1187  acknowledges  this  by  providing  simply  for  appropriate  regula-
tions in section 7(d)(2). 

Similarly, sport fishermen are concerned about regulation of marine sanitation de-
vices. While they agree with—and already meet—the requirements to use Type I or 
II  devices,  they  are  afraid  that  having  language  in  a  statute  governing  Sanctuaries 
will mean that Sanctuary enforcement officers, along with the Coast Guard, will be 
stopping their fishing operations and boarding their boats to inspect marine sanita-
tion  devices.  We  note  that  the  House  removed  specific  language  on  marine  sanita-
tion devices from H.R. 1187. 

California  ports  are  worried  about  the  effect  of  extending  the  Sanctuary  bound-
aries  to  the  mean  high  water  line  as  described  in  section  5.  The  dynamic  nature 
of  our  west  coast  currents  requires  frequent  dredging  of  navigation  channels  and 
berthing  areas  to  accommodate  commercial  and  recreational  vessel  traffic.  Prohibi-
tions  on  discharge  in  Sanctuaries  could  effectively  override  the  authority  and  sci-
entific  standards  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  and  the  Corps  of  Engi-
neers, making it difficult to keep our ports open. The House removed such language 
from  H.R.  1187  during  Committee  mark-up  and  we  believe  this  to  be  the  best  ap-
proach. 

Madame  Chair,  we  appreciate  the  Congress’s  efforts  to  expedite  changes  in  the 
Sanctuary  boundaries  through  legislation  and  that  some  of  our  suggestions  for 
changes in the original version of the bill have been adopted by the House. But un-
less  our  concerns  about  keeping  the  promise  to  fishermen  are  met,  we  cannot  sup-
port  the  bill.  We  would  rather  take  our  chances  with  the  existing  administrative 
process;  even  the  proposed  regulations  changing  the  management  plans  for  these 
Sanctuaries are explicit in protecting our commercial and recreational fisheries. 

I  have  attached  to  my  written  testimony  some  suggested  changes  to  H.R.  1187 
that  we  think  would  provide  continued  protection  for  our  fisheries.  We  would  be 
happy  to  work  with  you  and  your  staff  to  further  refine  the  language  in  the  bill. 
Again, thank you for the opportunity to present the Alliance’s views on H.R. 1187. 

I would be happy to answer any questions.

RE: PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL COMMENTS ON S. 2635 

Dear Senator Smith: 

Thank  you  for  your  continued  interest  in  west  coast  fishery  issues  and  your  re-
quest for Pacific Fishery Management Council (Pacific Council) comments on legisla-
tive matters of interest to the Pacific Council.

At  its  April  2008  meeting,  the  Pacific  Council  and  its  Legislative  Committee  re-
viewed  a  variety  of  legislative  matters  including  H.R.  1187,  the  Gulf  of  the 
Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  Boundary  Modification 
and  Protection  Act,  as  passed  by  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  on  March  31, 
2008 and referred to the U.S. Senate. Additionally, on February 13, 2008, U.S. Sen-
ator Barbara Boxer (D–CA) introduced the bill in the U.S. Senate as S. 2635. Given 
these  bills  are  now  matters  for  U.S.  Senate  consideration,  the  Pacific  Council  re-
quested I reiterate the following comments of the Pacific Council on H.R. 1187 origi-
nally conveyed to you in my letter of October 9, 2007. 

• It is unclear why these proposed boundary expansions and protective measures 
were not adopted and implemented under the recently completed Joint Manage-
ment Plan Review (JMPR) process for the Monterey Bay, Gulf of the Farallones, 
and  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuaries.  The  Pacific  Council  believes 
some  of  the  expansion  alternatives  and  prohibitions  may  have  been  considered 
and  rejected  during  the  JMPR,  and  questions  why  these  provisions  are  being 
proposed  for  implementation  through  legislation  rather  than  the  public  JMPR 
process. 

• Section 2 of H.R. 1187 and S. 2635 find the areas within these sanctuaries ‘‘in-
clude  some  of  the  Nation’s  richest  fishing  grounds’’  and  that  ‘‘Cordell  Bank  is 
at the nexus of an ocean upwelling system, which produces the highest biomass 
concentrations on the west coast of the United States.’’ While the Pacific Coun-
cil agrees these areas are productive and are likely to be ecologically important 
to  the  west  coast,  these  findings  would  benefit  from  independent  verification. 
• Section 3 of H.R. 1187 and S. 2635 states that ‘‘nothing in this Act is intended 
to  alter  any  existing  authorities  regarding  the  conduct  and  location  of  fishing 
activities  in  the  Sanctuaries.’’  The  Pacific  Council  recommends  this  stated  in-
tent be accompanied by a statutory mandate that fishery management authority 
in  Federal  waters  of  the  Sanctuaries  is  retained  by  the  Pacific  Council  and  the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. 

• Section  6  of  H.R.  1187  and  S.  2635  further  clarifies  that  these  bills  do  not  in-
tend to prohibit the discharge of biodegradable effluents or the discharge of fish, 
fish  parts,  and  chumming  materials  while  legally  fishing.  The  Pacific  Council 
is  concerned  about  the  regulation  of  waste  water  discharges  and  would  like  to 
confirm that the United States Coast Guard retains its current level of author-
ity on these matters. 

Perhaps central to the Pacific Council’s interest in these matters is achieving leg-
islative  clarity  on  the  authority  to  regulate  fishing  within  National  Marine  Sanc-
tuaries. The Pacific Council is in the early stages of initiating an Ecosystem Fishery 
Management  Plan  (EFMP)  that  is  intended  to  serve  as  an  ‘‘umbrella’’  plan  that 
would  advance  fishery  management  under  our  four  existing  fishery  management 
plans by introducing new science and new authorities to the current Pacific Council 
process. The Pacific Council has successfully employed spatial management concepts 
for years and has recommended closed areas to rebuild overfished species, minimize 
bycatch,  and  preserve  essential  fish  habitat.  The  Pacific  Council  believes  an  EFMP 
will be an effective tool in achieving shared ecosystem-based management goals and 
objectives of the Pacific Council, National Marine Fisheries Service and the National 
Ocean Service within and outside National Marine Sanctuaries. 

Thank you again for providing the Pacific Council an opportunity to provide com-

ments on H.R. 1187 and S. 2635. 

Sincerely, 

D.O. MCISAAC, PH.D., 

Executive Director.

I’m going to start with Mr. Gray, on the Thunder Bay Sanctuary 
and  its  origins.  Originally,  when  that  was  proposed,  it  was  pro-
posed as a much larger sanctuary, is that correct—originally? 

Mr. GRAY. Yes, ma’am, it was proposed to be about twice the size 
of  the  current  boundaries.  In  the  negotiations  with  the  State  of 
Michigan,  entire  sanctuaries  within  State  waters,  as  all  the  Great 
Lakes bottom lines, belong to the states. Due to concerns about the 
sanctuary,  it  was  negotiated  to  about  half  the  size  of  the  current 
proposed—current sanctuary. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  And  has  that  been  effective  at  meeting  its 
original  goals  and  protecting  the  historic  shipwrecks  and  every-
thing within the sanctuary? 

Mr.  GRAY.  I  believe  it  has.  The  communities  that  were  opposed 
to  joining  the  sanctuary  at  the  beginning  have  all  passed  formal 
resolutions at the county level and the city level and township level 
asking to be brought into the sanctuary. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  So,  you  think  the  differences  from  where  we 
were  on  the  original  proposal  to  now,  today,  in  expansion,  is  just 
that  people  have  gotten  more  comfortable  with  the  result  of  the 
sanctuary creation and now are back to where the original proposal 
was. Is that—— 

Mr. GRAY. It’s actually back, and expanded beyond that, is what 
this proposal and our Advisory Council have proposed—beyond the 
original  scope.  I  believe  a  big  part  of  that  success  is  NOAA  being 
in the community and part of the community. We work very closely 
with  all  of  our  community  partners  from  the  State  level  down  to 
the  local  community,  local  businesses.  And  I  believe  that’s  the 
strongest change. Prior to designation, there wasn’t the same pres-
ence in the community. 

Senator  CANTWELL.—okay.  And  Senator  Levin  mentioned  that 
there was a lot of discussion from community leaders, and you just 
mentioned  the  county,  so  is  there—were  those  public  forums—how 
did they reach their—— 

Mr. GRAY. During—we held scoping meetings at the beginning of 
our boundary—or at the beginning of our management plan review 
process  throughout  the  three  counties.  We  received  comment  at 
those.  The  local  governments,  they  all  passed  their  resolutions  as 
part  of  their  formal  meetings,  so  those—yes,  they  were  all  public 
forums. 

Senator CANTWELL. OK. Thank you. 
Mr. GRAY. Thank you. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  And  so,  you  don’t  know  of  any  local  opposi-

tion, is what you’re saying. Is—— 

Mr. GRAY. No, ma’am. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Right.  And 

I  didn’t  ask  Admiral 
Lautenbacher  about  this  in  his  testimony,  but  obviously  they  have 
been supportive of this expansion, as well. 
Mr. GRAY. The local communities or—— 
Senator  CANTWELL.  NOAA.  NOAA  has  been  supportive  of  this 

expansion, as well. 

Mr.  GRAY.—the  underlying  goals  of  it  is  to  protect  these  ship-

wrecks. Yes, they are. 

Senator CANTWELL. OK, thank you.

Dr.  Williams,  Ms.  Fosmark  talked  about  the  large  support  from 
the  fishing  industry,  in  general.  What  do  we—what  else  do  we 
know about local support of this expansion? And what has the proc-
ess been to actually ascertain that local support? 

Dr.  WILLIAMS.  The  formal  process  for  the  local  support  and 
broader  support  started  when  Congresswomen  Woolsey  introduced 
the  bill  in  2004.  Thereafter,  four  county  boards  of  supervisors— 
Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, and Mendocino—called for a public 
meeting, a hearing. They passed a resolution endorsing the bill. All 
of  those  meetings  were  publicly  noticed,  and  public  comment,  oral 
and written, were encouraged. 

In  addition,  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  the  Cordell  Bank 
Sanctuaries  Advisory  Council  had  meetings  that  were  noticed,  and 
they ended up endorsing the Act, the legislation. 

In  addition,  the  City  of  San  Francisco  and  the  Port  of  Oakland 
also  endorsed  the  bill.  And  before  2004,  there  was  public  scoping 
processes  going  on  in  regards  to  the  proposed  legislation,  but  the 
proposal for the expansion was brought up originally by the public, 
and  that  started,  in  part,  as  part  of  the  joint  draft  management 
scoping  plan,  and  even  before  that.  For  example,  the  fishermen 
in—associated  with  the  largest  fishing  group  on  the  West  Coast, 
the  Pacific  Coast  Federation  of  Fishermen’s  Association,  had  re-
quested  that  the  Cordell  Bank  boundary,  when  it  was  designated, 
include  part  of  the  expansion  area.  So,  public  support  has  really 
been overwhelming. Since 2002, I’ve attended, that I can recall and 
have on record, at least seven public scoping meetings where public 
comments,  written  and  oral,  have  been  encouraged.  Some  of  these 
scoping  meetings  were  done  at  the  request  of  the  sanctuary  man-
agers. For example, there was one in 2006, held at Bodega Marine 
Laboratory,  where,  as  part  of  the  agenda,  the  Modified  Boundary 
Act was considered. At that time, it was H.R. 1712 and Senate bill 
880, I believe. 

So, I have heard no local opposition; in fact, what I hear is over-
whelming  support  for  this  expansion;  in  particular,  because  people 
recognize  the  economic  importance  of  the  marine  resources  in  the 
sanctuary,  both  the  fishes,  but  also  the  tourism  industry  is  very 
important along the coast. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Ms.  Fosmark,  you  talked  about  the  fishing 
issues. And obviously the Sanctuaries Act requires cooperation with 
appropriate  fisheries  management  authorities.  And  so,  doesn’t  the 
Pacific  Council  get  their  say  in  the  expansion?  I  mean,  won’t  they 
have their input as it relates to fisheries management? 

Ms.  FOSMARK.  Yes.  Actually,  there  is  a  letter  that  was  sent  by 
the  Pacific  Fishery  Management  Council—it  should  be  attached  to 
my written testimony—from the Pacific Council regarding this bill. 
They’re—the  Alliance  is  also—the  Pacific  Fishery  Management 
Council  did  comment  on  the  need  question  for  marine  protected 
areas, and the issue here is, in 2004, there wasn’t that risk of zon-
ing, and this particular issue came up later. However, PCFFA, Pa-
cific  Coast  Federation  of  Fishermen’s  Association,  is  a  subgroup  of 
the Alliance, and did separately write a letter supporting some lan-
guage, the same exact language that we have in our testimony here 
today.

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  guess  my  question  is,  if  this  is  a  concern, 
then  why  are  organizations  like  the  Pacific  Coast  Federation  of 
Fishermen and the Association of Bodega Bay Fishermen endorsing 
the  proposal?  I  mean,  they’re  local  fishermen  that  are  supporting 
it.  So,  I  think  of  the  council  management  as,  you  know,  a  coordi-
nating  agency,  but  I  would  think  that  they  would  take  their  cues 
from  local  fishermen,  whether  they—there  were—they  were  con-
cerned. And if local fishermen weren’t concerned, how is that—you 
know, how are those two things not being represented? 

Ms.  FOSMARK.  Local  fishermen,  which,  I  may  say,  I  am  one  of 
those local fishermen, they did have a concern, but they were reas-
sured there was language in the bill that would protect them. How-
ever, it doesn’t make it totally clear about fisheries management in 
the bill. It only says that fishermen—that fishing—it’s a very vague 
version,  it  just  doesn’t  clarify  who  has  the  authority  to  manage 
fish. The difference between the Sanctuary and the Pacific Council 
is,  the  Pacific  Council  is  a  very  open  process,  it’s  based  on  sub-
committees,  science  and  statistical  committees.  It  has  a  checks- 
and-balance  system,  and  it  regulates  fisheries  very  well.  That  is 
not the case in the Sanctuary—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I  think—I  think  the  point  is,  is  that— 
while  I’m  not  sure  if  you’re  referring  to  the  House  bill,  but  H.R. 
1187  may  not  have  that  language  clarified  as  to  the  point  you’re 
making,  but  certainly  the  National  Marine  Sanctuary  Act  does. 
And  it  requires  that  they—there  be  cooperation  with  other  appro-
priate fishery management authorities in drafting any fishing regu-
lations in the sanctuary. So, that authority is there in the original 
Act.  So,  you  may  not—you’re  not  seeing  that  coordination  in  the 
language  of  this  proposed  bill,  but  it’s  certainly  there  in  current 
law, so you would have that coordination. 

Ms. FOSMARK. Yes. And we do understand—I do understand that 
there  is  that  coordination  and  that  they  must  come  to  the  council 
to find a proper course of action. It says that, as well. Our problem 
is  that,  rather  than  come  to  the  council,  they’re  announcing  that 
marine protected areas and zoning closures in marine reserves are 
necessary  in  other  sanctuaries  south  of  there,  and  the  fear  that 
fishermen  have  is  that  they  will  lose  fishing  grounds.  And  if  they 
don’t have access to their fishing grounds, including crab and salm-
on,  which  is  a  very  important  fishery  to  those  regions,  they  will 
suffer,  and  those  communities  will  suffer.  And  this  is  the  main 
problem we’re having, is that zoning is not being considered a fish-
ing regulation. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Dr.  Williams,  would  you  like  to  comment  on 

that? 

Dr. WILLIAMS. H.R. 1187 addresses Cordell Bank and Gulf of the 
Farallones  National  Marine  Sanctuaries,  and  these  sanctuaries 
have forged a very cooperative and responsive relationship with the 
fishermen.  This—examples  of  this  are  on  the  record  of  the  House 
subcommittee consideration of this legislation. And there has never 
been a problem in those sanctuaries with cooperating and being re-
sponsive to the fishermen’s needs. 

Zeke  Grader,  who  is  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Pacific  Coast 
Federation  of  Fishing  Associations,  which  is  the  largest  on  the 
West  Coast,  submitted  a  written  statement  that  stated,  ‘‘The  lan-

guage, as it exists in 1187, was a model for the rest of the Nation.’’ 
Other  sanctuaries  have  different  relationships  with  the  fisheries. 
We  are  talking  about  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank 
managers,  and  they  have  excellent  relations.  They  have  included 
fishermen,  and  they  have—if  you  read  the  notes  in  the  fisheries— 
Pacific Fisheries Management Council and the Sanctuary Advisory 
Council,  you  can  see  that  over  the  past  few  years  there  has  been 
exchange about fishing in these sanctuaries. Also, the issue here is 
not the designation of marine protected areas, it’s expansion of the 
boundaries of the Cordell Bank and Gulf of the Farallones National 
Marine Sanctuaries. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you. 
Well,  we’ve  been  joined  by  my  colleague  Senator  Boxer.  Thank 
you  very  much  for  being  here.  And  I  obviously—know  you  have 
great interest in at least one of these two areas—— 

Senator BOXER. Yes. 
Senator  CANTWELL.—we’re  hearing  about  this  morning.  So,  I’m 

going to turn the questioning over to you. 

STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 

Senator BOXER. Thank you so much. 
And I just wanted to explain that all morning I’ve been chairing 
a  hearing  about  perchlorate,  over  in—and  the  dangers  of  per-
chlorate—over  at  EPW,  and  I’m  done.  I  turned  over  the  gavel  so 
I  could  stay  here,  because  this  is  such  an  important  matter.  And 
I thank the witnesses. 

And I thank you so much, and Senators Inouye and Stevens, for 

having a hearing here. 

If it’s OK with you, could I respond to this fishery issue here and 
then  could  I  give  a—I  think  it’s  about  a—oh,  4-minute  opening 
statement?  Because—and  I  want  to  show  you  some  photos  and 
such, and then I’ll be done. 

Senator CANTWELL. Certainly. 
Senator  BOXER.  I  don’t  have  a  lot  of  questions,  because,  frankly, 
I  think  the  questions  have  been  answered  by  my  fishermen  up 
there.  I  do  understand  and  respect  the  comments  of  Ms.  Fosmark, 
but we are talking about a sanctuary in the northern part—it’s not 
the  Monterey  Bay.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  in  the  bill  itself,  in  H.R. 
1187—and I quote from the written statement of Zeke Grader, Ex-
ecutive Director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s As-
sociation;  he  made  this  statement  to  the  House.  He  said,  ‘‘Finally, 
H.R.  1187  makes  clear  that  existing  fishery  entities’’—and  he  lists 
who  they  are—California  Department  of  Fish  and  Game,  he  lists 
them  all—‘‘retain  sole  activity  over  fisheries  within  sanctuary 
water.’’  Section  (3)(c)  effect  on  fishing  activities  says  in  our  bill, 
‘‘Nothing in this Act is intended to alter any existing authorities re-
garding  the  conduct  and  location  of  fishing  activities  in  the  sanc-
tuaries.’’ 

I  think  this  is  a—if  I  could  say,  a  strong  man,  strong  person— 
because  it’s  just  not  true.  And  I  see  our  fishermen  from  that  area 
being so supportive. They are one of the lead supporters of this bill. 
I  mean,  what—let  me  tell  you  what  Zeke  Grader  said,  Ms. 
Fosmark.  He  said,  ‘‘In  supporting  the  creation  of  the  Gulf  of  the 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

61 

Farallones  Sanctuary,  our  organization  sought  to  protect  some  of 
the best fishing grounds along the Pacific Coast, not to close them.’’ 
And so, I think, you know, if there are some issues—maybe there 
is  a  little  misunderstanding,  and  I  would  love  to  meet  with  Ms. 
Fosmark,  because  I  love  the  work  she  does.  But,  I  just  feel  there 
is  a  disconnect  here  between  the  reality  and  some  of  the  things 
you’ve said. 

And I think that when the House passes a bill—what was it? By 
voice vote? Is that right—a bill by voice vote, frankly I don’t think 
there is any controversy, really, because it wouldn’t have done that. 
So,  our  important  bill  will  protect  one  of  the  world’s  most  bio-
logically  diverse  and  productive  regions.  And  I  wanted  to  com-
pliment  Congresswoman  Lynn  Woolsey,  Senator  Feinstein,  and 
again  say,  to  have  a  bill  pass  by  voice  vote  in  the  House  is  almost 
impossible,  and  this  one  did  it,  and  I  would  hate  to  see  any  slow-
down here. I’d like to move this along. I feel strongly about it. 

I  want  to  show  you  the  photo  of  the  Sonoma  coast  to  show  you 
how truly spectacular and pristine this area is. And, Madam Chair-
man,  I  don’t  have  to  prove  anything  to  you,  but  I  always—one  of 
the  favorite  things  I  do  as  a  Senator  is  work  toward  these  kinds 
of bills, and wilderness bills, like you, and I want to share this. 

Established  in  1980  and  1989,  respectively,  the  Gulf  of  the 
Farallones  and  Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  have 
helped  protect  the  marine  waters  and  the  coastline  that  are 
quintessentially  Californian  and  quintessentially  West  Coast.  My 
bill will protect an even greater part of my state’s coast by expand-
ing the sanctuaries’ boundaries to include more of northern Califor-
nia’s  great  upwelling  marine  area,  one  of  only  four  on  the  planet. 
And  I  want  to  take  just  a  moment.  Upwelling  areas  are  places 
where  deeper  water  comes  to  the  surface,  bringing  the  nutrients 
needed  by  marine  algae  to  grow  and  support  all  higher  forms  of 
marine life. Though upwelling areas comprise only 1 percent of the 
world’s  ocean,  they  produce  20  percent  of  the  fish.  Let  me  say  it 
again: 1 percent of the world’s ocean are upwelling areas, but they 
produce  20  percent  of  the  fish.  So,  we  can’t  turn  away  and—and 
especially  we  can’t  turn  away  in  the  name  of  saving  fisheries.  We 
need to save the fisheries by protecting these areas. 

The area from Point Arena to Bodega Bay, currently outside the 
sanctuary  boundary,  is  particularly  important.  It  has  the  most  in-
tense upwelling in all of North America, and an enormous capacity 
to  support  marine  life.  And  I  am  proud  that  Senator  Feinstein’s 
and  my  bill  will  expand  the  sanctuary  boundaries  to  protect  this 
upwelling area. 

The unique productivity of this region is illustrated by the abun-
dance  and  diversity  of  marine  life  it  supports.  And  I  want  to  show 
a  series  of  charts  here:  36  species  of  marine  mammals,  including 
the  endangered  blue  and  humpback  whales.  And,  Madam  Chair, 
we  have  worked  so  hard  on  protecting  these  creatures.  Numerous 
coastal and migratory seabirds—we’ll show you—oh, that’s another 
beautiful—that  is  a  seal,  and  you  don’t  have  it  listed  here,  but  I 
know that’s a seal. And— 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BOXER.—coastal  and  migratory  seabirds,  including  the 
blackfooted  albatross.  Do  we  actually  have  that  one?  I’m  getting

you  very  confused.  This  is—these  are  the  seabirds.  Look  at  them. 
Endangered leatherback turtles and coho salmon. 

And this is the—this is the beauty. Expanding the existing sanc-
tuaries to include this area is necessary to protect this remarkable 
ecosystem from pollution and habitat degradation. 

I want to list the broad support the bill has: the California Coast-
al  Commission,  the  California  State  Lands  Commission,  the  coun-
ties  of  Sonoma,  Marin,  and  Mendocino,  and  the  City  of  San  Fran-
cisco. Madam Chair, those are the areas that have the elected offi-
cials  that  are  in  closest  proximity  to  this.  Also  supported  by  the 
fishermen  in  the  area,  including  the  Pacific  Coast  Federation  of 
Fishermen’s Association, by far the largest and most active associa-
tion of commercial fishermen on the West Coast. 

The fishermen, most of all, recognize the urgency of passing this 
legislation:  to  preserve  the  water  quality  and  habitat  essential  for 
good fishing. Our bill will help preserve an incomparable gem of an 
ecosystem,  and  I  certainly  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and 
our colleagues to move this important legislation forward. 

And,  again,  I  want  to  thank  Dr.  Williams.  And,  Ms.  Fosmark,  I 

hope after the hearing we can have a chance to chat, as well. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Boxer follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA 
Thank  you  Chairwoman  Cantwell  and  Ranking  Member  Snowe,  and  Chairman 
Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens, for including ‘‘the Gulf of the Farallones and 
Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  Boundary  Modification  and  Protection 
Act’’  in  today’s  hearing.  This  important  bill  would  protect  one  of  the  world’s  most 
biologically-diverse  and  productive  marine  regions.  I  am  proud  to  be  joined  in  this 
effort by Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey and Senator Dianne Feinstein, and pleased 
that this bill passed the House of Representatives in March by voice vote. 

This  photo  of  the  Sonoma  Coast  shows  how  truly  spectacular  and  pristine  this 
area  is.  Established  in  1981  and  1989  respectively,  the  Gulf  of  the  Farallones  and 
Cordell  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  have  helped  protect  the  special  marine 
waters  and  coastline  that  are  quintessentially  Californian.  My  bill  will  protect  an 
even  greater  part  of  my  state’s  coast  by  expanding  the  Sanctuaries’  boundaries  to 
include more of northern California’s great ‘‘upwelling’’ marine area, one of only four 
on the planet. 

Upwelling areas are places where deeper water comes up to the surface, bringing 
the  nutrients  needed  by  marine  algae  to  grow  and  support  all  higher  forms  of  ma-
rine life. Though upwelling areas comprise only 1 percent of the world’s ocean they 
produce  20  percent  of  its  fish—that’s  right,  20  percent.  The  area  from  Point  Arena 
to  Bodega  Bay,  currently  outside  the  sanctuaries’  boundaries,  is  particularly  impor-
tant  since  it  consistently  has  the  most  intense  upwelling  in  all  of  North  America 
and  an  enormous  capacity  to  support  marine  life.  I  am  proud  that  my  bill  will  ex-
pand the sanctuaries’ boundaries to protect this upwelling area. 

The  unique  productivity  of  this  region  is  illustrated  by  the  abundance  and  diver-
sity of marine life it supports: 36 species of marine mammals, including the endan-
gered blue and humpback whales; numerous coastal and migratory seabirds includ-
ing the black-footed albatross; endangered leatherback turtles; and coho salmon. Ex-
panding the existing Sanctuaries to include this area is necessary to protect this re-
markable ecosystem from pollution and habitat degradation. 

My  bill  has  broad,  local  support,  including  from  the  California  Coastal  Commis-
sion,  the  California  State  Lands  Commission,  the  Counties  of  Sonoma,  Marin,  and 
Mendocino, and the City of San Francisco. It is also supported by fishermen, includ-
ing the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, by far the largest and 
most active association of commercial fishermen on the West Coast. Fishermen rec-
ognize  the  urgency  of  passing  this  legislation  to  preserve  the  water  quality  and 
habitat essential for good fishing. 

My  bill  will  help  preserve  an  incomparable  gem  of  an  ecosystem.  I  look  forward 

to working with my colleagues to move this important legislation.

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 
The  United  States  has  the  greatest  amount  of  coastline  in  the  world,  and  more 
than  half  of  the  Nation’s  residents  live  in  coastal  counties.  Our  Nation  will  be  in-
creasingly  affected  by  coastal  issues,  and  NOAA  must  be  equipped  to  handle  them. 
Louisianans  are  concerned  about  many  of  these  issues,  including  sustainable  and 
productive fisheries, hurricane and storm surge forecasting, and coastal erosion and 
restoration. 

I  am  concerned  by  the  distribution  of  funds  in  the  President’s  FY  2009  NOAA 
budget. This year’s budget of $4.1 billion represents a modest increase of $202 mil-
lion  over  the  FY  2008  enacted  levels,  but  comes  at  a  $40  million  cost  for  the  ‘‘wet 
side’’ programs of NOAA. 
Hurricane Research 

I  am  pleased  that  NOAA  is  supporting  more  hurricane  research.  Additional  re-
search,  forecasting,  and  infrastructure  will  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  hurricanes 
along  our  coasts.  Increases  for  the  Hurricane  Weather  Research  and  Forecasting 
model,  hurricane  data  buoys  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  elsewhere,  and  additional 
aircraft hours dedicated to hurricane research are a step in the right direction. 

I  also  urge  NOAA  to  work  toward  better  storm  surge  predictions.  I  have  pre-
viously  introduced  legislation  on  this  important  topic  and  believe  that  we  need  to 
make  significant  progress  on  storm  surge  prediction.  Hurricane  Katrina’s  storm 
surge  flooding  was  devastating,  and  I  hope  NOAA  can  advance  the  state  of  the 
science in this area to help prevent more loss of life and property. 
Hypoxia and Harmful Algal Blooms 

I  am  also  concerned  about  the  twin  problems  of  hypoxia  and  harmful  algal 
blooms.  Louisiana’s  offshore  hypoxic  zone  is  growing  and  impacts  our  tradition  of 
productive  fisheries.  In  2007  the  dead  zone  was  7,900  square  miles—that’s  roughly 
the size of New Jersey. 

Fish  and  shrimp  cannot  survive  in  the  dead  zone.  Loss  of  ocean  habitat  in  the 
future  through  dead  zone  expansion  may  have  severe  consequences  for  Louisiana’s 
commercial  fisheries,  yet  plans  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  dead  zone  to  2,500  square 
miles by 2015 are not on track. 

In  addition,  harmful  algal  blooms  damage  commercially  valuable  fisheries  and 
shellfisheries and threaten public health. I urge NOAA to devote more energy to fur-
ther  research  and  practical  control  and  mitigation  solutions  for  harmful  algal 
blooms and hypoxia. 
Marine Monuments 

As this hearing also dealt with some marine sanctuary issues, I’d like to reiterate 
my  opposition  to  any  plans  for  a  new  Gulf  of  Mexico  marine  monument.  The  use 
of the Antiquities Act to create a monument could restrict vitally important marine 
areas without the benefit of public participation and stakeholder input. The Gulf is 
home to nationally significant commercial and recreational fisheries as well as crit-
ical energy infrastructure, and a monument designation would take away these and 
other voices. 

The  two  existing  NOAA  sanctuaries  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  established  public  fo-
rums that involve all interested parties in decisions to protect marine areas. I urge 
that proposals in the future continue using these protocols, and not the Antiquities 
Act, so as to maintain a trusted, transparent public process. 

I would like to add a letter signed by Sens. Shelby, Sessions, and myself opposing 

marine monuments to the record.

Washington, DC, April 21, 2008 

U.S. SENATE 

Hon. JAMES CONNAUGHTON, 
Chairman, 
Council on Environmental Quality, 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Chairman Connaughton: 

We  are  writing  to  express  our  strong  objections  regarding  a  proposal  to  create  a 
network  of  marine  monuments  within  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  This  proposal,  currently 
being  circulated  within  the  Administration,  could  have  grave  impacts  for  the  Gulf 
Coast’s  recreational  fisheries,  commercial  fisheries,  marine  cargo  shipping,  and  do-
mestic  offshore  energy  industry.  Each  of  these  industries  is  of  fundamental  impor-
tance to our regional and state economies, and the Nation’s economy as well. 

It  is  our  understanding  that  you  and  representatives  from  the  National  Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration have discussed a plan for the President to declare 
a  network  of  marine  monuments  throughout  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  under  the  Antiq-
uities  Act  of  1906.  We  are  concerned  that  an  attempt  to  use  this  authority  could 
restrict  vitally  important  marine  areas  without  the  benefit  of  public  participation 
and stakeholder input. 

The  Gulf  of  Mexico  is  home  to  productive  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries 
that have an annual economic impact of over $4.5 billion. A number of the Nation’s 
top  ports  are  also  located  in  the  Gulf  region.  Maritime  infrastructure  and  fisheries 
are  still  recovering  after  the  devastating  2005  hurricanes,  while  facing  increased 
competition from subsidized foreign aquaculture and unsustainable fishing practices 
of other nations. 

In addition to nationally significant fisheries, the Gulf Coast has the greatest con-
centration  of  energy  infrastructure  in  the  world,  with  an  estimated  4,000  of  the 
world’s  7,000  offshore  platforms  located  here.  The  Gulf  of  Mexico  supplies  up  to  30 
percent  of  the  Nation’s  energy  needs,  and  provides  a  source  of  secure  domestic  en-
ergy in a time of increasing volatility in the world energy market. 

We  support  the  protection  of  environmentally  sensitive  marine  areas,  and  feel 
that the best way to continue to protect natural resources is to fully engage the pub-
lic  interest.  Recommendations  to  expand  protected  areas  should  be  based  on  recog-
nized need, with sound scientific justification. 

The  Gulf  of  Mexico  Fishery  Management  Council,  which  represents  a  spectrum 
of  stakeholder  interests  from  all  five  Gulf  states,  is  specifically  tasked  to  manage 
fisheries  and  identify  areas  of  particular  concern.  The  Flower  Garden  Banks  and 
Florida  Keys  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  Advisory  Councils  have  already  estab-
lished public forums which involve all interested parties in decisions to protect ma-
rine  areas.  Any  proposal  under  the  Antiquities  Act  would  short-circuit  these  coun-
cils, disrupting a trusted, transparent public process. 

We strongly urge you to refrain from moving forward on a Gulf of Mexico Marine 
Monument.  This  Administration  does  not  have  enough  remaining  time  to  fully  con-
sider the variety of public interests that must be represented, and such a significant 
project should not move forward without the participation and support of the many 
stakeholders involved. 

Sincerely,

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C. LAUTENBACHER, JR. 

Question 1a. Admiral Lautenbacher, while I am pleased to see a request of $60.3 
million  for  the  continuation  of  construction  for  the  Pacific  Regional  Center,  I  am 
concerned  that  this  level  of  funding  is  sufficient  for  only  two  of  the  three  buildings 
included  in  the  initial  plan.  How  do  you  intend  to  provide  for  the  construction  of 
the third building? 

Answer.  The  multi-year  funding  request  contained  in  the  FY  2009  President’s 
Budget  will  fund  renovation/construction  of  two  buildings  and  other  support  struc-
tures  for  central  IT/network  infrastructure  (‘‘main  distribution  facility’’),  security 
command  control  center,  and  other  central  building  operations  space  required  for 
the  security  and  operations  of  the  entire  Pacific  Regional  Center  complex.  The  Pa-
cific  Tsunami  Warning  Center  and  International  Tsunami  Information  Center  and 
several  other  small  programs,  will  remain  fully  operational  in  off-site,  primarily 
leased  space.  The  multi-year  budget  request,  if  appropriated,  will  allow  us  to  pro-
ceed with the consolidated Pacific Regional Center project. 

Question  1b.  The  unfunded  building  is  intended  to  house  the  central  computer 
system,  correct?  Is  this  system  not  critical  to  the  operational  capabilities  of  the  fa-
cilities as a whole? 

Answer.  The  President’s  FY  2009  Budget  Request  provides  funding  for  a  revised 
building  plan  in  which  the  critical  central  computer  system  is  housed  in  Building 
A. As mentioned above, the current plan for Building A supports the central IT/net-
work  infrastructure  (‘‘main  distribution  facility’’),  security  command  control  center, 
and other central building operations space required to support the security and op-
erations of the entire complex. 

Question 1c. If the requested funds for the Pacific Regional Center are not appro-

priated in FY 2009, what will be the impact to this project? 

Answer.  If  the  funds  requested  for  the  Pacific  Regional  Center  are  not  appro-
priated,  due  to  a  year-long  continuing  resolution  or  reductions  effected  during  the 
appropriations  process,  there  will  be  substantial  delays  in  both  schedule  and  cost 
associated  with  the  project.  We  estimate  there  will  be  a  10–15  percent  cost  esca-
lation  for  each  year  construction  is  delayed;  for  the  Pacific  Regional  Center,  this 
would amount to a $20–30 million cost growth. 

In  addition  to  the  cost  impact,  there  are  increased  risks  to  the  NOAA  programs 
supported  at  NOAA’s  current  facilities,  should  the  project  be  delayed.  The  Pacific 
Regional Center replaces dispersed, at-risk, and overcrowded buildings with consoli-
dated,  state-of-the-art  facilities  supporting  the  critical  science,  research  and  oper-
ational missions conducted by NOAA in Hawaii. 

Question  1d.  Admiral,  the  Pacific  Regional  Center  in  Hawaii  represents  a  unique 
opportunity  for  NOAA  to  consolidate  its  various  programs  and  organizations  under 
one  roof  and  to  utilize  existing  Federal  property.  However,  I  am  concerned  that 
NOAA  will  face  funding  challenges  with  the  operation  of  this  Center  in  the  future, 
similar  to  those  challenges  faced  in  the  Seattle,  Washington,  Center.  How  does  the 
NOAA intend to fund the day-to-day operating costs at the new Center and to plan 
for out-year funding requirements for repairs at the Center? 

Answer. Costs at an owned-facility can be categorized into three categories: 
• Annual operating expenses (e.g., utilities, maintenance contracts). 
• Sustainment  expenses  (predictable  investments  to  maintain  the  functionality  of 
a building); e.g., regularly scheduled replacement of building systems and equip-
ment). 
• Repair and restoration expenses (unpredictable repair or replacement of building 

systems to restore operations). 

The first category (annual operating expenses) is predictable, and relatively stable 
from  year-to-year.  The  second  category  (sustainment  expenses),  is  predictable,  but 
not as stable from year-to-year, since it is affected by the life-cycle of specific build-
ing  systems,  and  the  costs  of  building  systems.  For  example,  a  roof  may  only  need 
to  be  replaced  every  20  years  (predictable),  but  its  replacement  costs  are  likely  to 
cause  large  spikes  in  required  funding  (not  stable).  The  final  category  (repair/res-
toration) is not predictable, and also not stable from year-to-year; it is also affected 
by failure to adequately fund sustainment costs at a facility. 

The  preferred  model  for  supporting  these  types  of  costs  at  the  Pacific  Regional 

Center would be as follows: 

1.  Annual  operating  expenses  (including  sustainment  costs):  Annual  operating 
expenses  would  be  paid  through  current  program/line  office  ‘‘tenant’’  transfers 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

68 

(e.g., for utilities, maintenance contracts, etc.) toward the overall costs of build-
ing operations. Any additional operational costs at the new Center above histor-
ical  cost  levels  incurred  in  the  separate  facilities  would  be  requested  through 
the appropriations process as an increase in the Operations, Research, and Fa-
cilities (ORF) account. 
2. Repair and restoration costs: These costs would be funded through the estab-
lishment  of  a  dedicated  budget  line  within  the  Procurement,  Acquisition,  and 
Construction  account.  This  approach  provides  a  transparent  way  to  evaluate 
and budget for major facility repairs during each fiscal cycle. 

Question  2a.  The  NOAA  budget  requests  an  additional  $4.5  million  for  non-labor 
related  adjustments,  such  as  fuel  costs.  Given  record  high  energy  prices,  is  this  in-
crease sufficient for NOAA to meet rising fuel costs for its aircraft and vessel oper-
ations? 

Answer.  At  the  time  of  our  FY  2009  budget  development,  NOAA  projected  ship 
diesel fuel to cost $2.47 per gallon. The FY 2009 President’s Budget request includes 
approximately  $14.9  million  for  ship  fuel.  NOAA  expects  the  average  price  for  fuel 
for  the  remainder  of  FY  2008  to  be  about  $4.12  per  gallon.  In  the  event  that  this 
price  remains  the  average  for  FY  2009,  NOAA  would  need  approximately  an  addi-
tional  $10.4  million  over  the  planned  amount  to  cover  diesel  fuel  for  the  fleet  to 
maintain planned FY 2009 operation levels. 

[NOAA  attempts  to  use  a  Department  of  Defense  fueling  contract  to  refuel  its 
ships  whenever  feasible.  However,  depending  on  their  in-port  location,  sometimes 
the ships must refuel paying the prevailing commercial market rate.] 

Rising  fuel  prices  have  also  impacted  NOAA’s  ability  to  charter  days  at  sea.  The 
day rate to charter both UNOLS and commercial ships has increased due to the rise 
in  fuel  costs.  For  example,  R/V  REVELLE’s  FY  2007  day  rate  was  $26,200/day.  As 
of  March  2008,  this  rate  is  now  $32,000/day,  a  22  percent  increase.  Other  UNOLS 
vessels of the same class have also correspondingly increased their day rates. 

As with the rising costs of ship fuel, aviation fuel prices have also increased. Dur-
ing  development  of  the  FY  2009  budget,  NOAA  projected  aircraft  fuel  to  cost  $2.93 
per  gallon.  The  FY  2009  President’s  Budget  Request  includes  approximately  $4.0 
million  for  aircraft  fuel.  However,  fuel  prices  paid  by  NOAA  aircraft  have  averaged 
$3.79  per  gallon  in  FY  2008,  and  we  estimate  that  fuel  will  cost  $4.20  per  gallon 
in  FY  2009.  This  estimate  translates  into  an  FY  2009  aviation  fuel  cost  of  approxi-
mately $5.8 million for NOAA aircraft to maintain planned operation levels. 

shortfall? 

Question 2b. If this funding level is not sufficient, how do you plan to address the 

Answer. High diesel fuel prices may limit NOAA’s ability to perform scientific op-
erations  at  sea.  At  the  budget  planning  estimate  of  $2.47  per  gallon  for  diesel  fuel, 
NOAA  ships  were  expected  to  support  3,390  operating  days  in  FY  2009.  Through 
June  2008,  the  NOAA  fleet  has  averaged  $3.05/gallon  for  the  fiscal  year.  When 
NOAA  finalizes  its  Fleet  Allocation  Plan  in  the  year  of  execution,  we  will  update 
the estimate for operating days. 

Escalating aviation fuel prices will also cut into NOAA’s flight hours. At the budg-
eted  rate  of  $2.93  per  gallon,  we  expected  NOAA  aircraft  to  support  2,845  flight 
hours  in  FY  2009.  At  the  projected  rate  of  $4.20  per  gallon,  NOAA  could  provide 
1,750 flight hours—a reduction of 1,095 hours or a 38 percent decrease. 

To compensate for higher than planned ship and aircraft fuel prices, one or more 
NOAA platforms may need to be brought off-line for the year or platforms may expe-
rience  a  reduction  in  operating  days  or  flight  hours.  The  NOAA  Fleet  Council  will 
evaluate  these  measures  for  their  programmatic  and  public  impacts  before  NOAA 
makes its final decisions. 

Question  3a.  In  its  vision  statement,  the  NOAA  underscores  the  value  of  an  in-
formed  society.  However,  the  President’s  FY  2009  budget  proposes  to  cut  funding 
for NOAA’s education programs by 48 percent. Admiral, how does the NOAA intend 
to educate and inform the public without adequate education programs? 

Answer.  NOAA  has  requested  $16.5  million  in  FY  2009  for  the  NOAA  Education 
Office.  NOAA  also  funds  education  activities  through  a  number  of  programs  in  the 
line offices. For example, the President’s FY 2009 Budget Request includes $3.2 mil-
lion  for  educational  activities  conducted  through  the  National  Marine  Sanctuaries 
Program,  the  National  Estuarine  Research  Reserves,  and  the  Coral  Reef  Conserva-
tion Program, all within the National Ocean Service. 

NOAA is currently updating its Education Plan as requested by the America Cre-
ating  Opportunities  to  Meaningfully  Promote  Excellence  in  Technology  Education, 
and  Science  Act.  In  addition,  NOAA  has  contracted  the  National  Academy  of 
Sciences  to  perform  a  review  of  its  Education  program  and  provide  recommenda-

69 

tions  for  optimizing  NOAA’s  investment  in  education.  That  review  is  currently  un-
derway and the results will be considered as NOAA develops future budget requests. 
Question  3b.  What  is  the  NOAA  doing  to  assert  the  value  of  its  education  pro-

grams both within the government and externally to the public? 

Answer.  NOAA  has  a  vision  for  ‘‘an  informed  society  that  uses  a  comprehensive 
understanding  of  the  role  of  the  oceans,  coasts  and  atmosphere  in  the  global  eco-
system  to  make  the  best  social  and  economic  decisions.’’  Inherent  in  this  vision  is 
the need for an environmentally literate public that is aware of, and capable of un-
derstanding,  issues  affecting  Earth’s  environment.  NOAA  generates  data  and  sci-
entific findings that are crucial for assessing the state of the oceans and the atmos-
phere. NOAA is actively working to assure that these unique data and findings are 
provided to the public in a focused manner that will foster advancement of environ-
mental literacy. 

In 2007, Congress recognized the role of NOAA in Earth system science education 
with  the  passage  of  the  America  COMPETES  Act  (P.L.  110–69).  This  legislation 
mandates  NOAA  to  ‘‘conduct,  develop,  support,  promote,  and  coordinate  formal  and 
informal  education  activities  at  all  levels  to  enhance  public  awareness  and  under-
standing  of  ocean,  coastal,  Great  Lakes,  and  atmospheric  science  and  stewardship 
by  the  general  public  and  other  coastal  stakeholders,  including  underrepresented 
groups in ocean and atmospheric science and policy careers.’’ 

NOAA  is  actively  engaged,  both  within  the  Federal  Government  and  externally, 

to meet these requirements. 
Interagency Efforts 

NOAA  is  the  co-chair  in  the  Interagency  Working  Group  on  Ocean  Education 
(IWG–OE),  established  by  the  Interagency  Committee  on  Ocean  Science  and  Re-
source  Management  Integration  (ICOSRMI).  The  IWG–OE  is  tasked  to  implement 
recommendations of the U.S. Ocean Action Plan to collaborate across Federal agen-
cies  in  order  to  increase  ocean  literacy  and  build  a  future  work  force.  Formally  es-
tablished in 2006, the working group has been working to compare agency programs 
and identify common priorities. The IWG–OE’s efforts: 

• Address lifelong learning through formal and informal education; 
• Leverage resources by broadening and strengthening networks and investing in 

common messages; 

• Recognize ocean education as a specific expression of Earth system science and 

environmental education and link to these important concepts; and 

• Promote  the 

3Ocean  Literacy  Essential  Principles  and  Fundamental  Concepts 
1as  a  model  framework  for  organizing  our  efforts  to  increase  understanding  of 

the relevance of the ocean to our everyday lives. 

External Efforts 
Partnerships 

NOAA has established strategic partnerships with formal and informal education 
groups  that  promote  the  use  of  NOAA  products  and  services  and  contribute  toward 
the development of an environmentally literate public. Key partnerships include: 

• National  Science  Teachers  Association  (NSTA):  NOAA  is  working  with  NSTA, 
through a Cooperative Agreement, to develop a series of education products for 
teachers  on  topics  aligned  to  NOAA’s  mission.  These  products  provide  tens  of 
thousands  of  science  teachers  with  professional  development  and  classroom  re-
sources in the form of Science Objects, SciGuides, and WebSeminars. 
• Ocean and Climate Literacy efforts: To ensure consistency and incorporation of 
key  NOAA  subject  areas,  NOAA  engaged  external  partners,  both  Federal  and 
non-, for the development of both the Ocean and the Climate Literacy essential 
principles and fundamental concepts. NOAA is working with the education com-
munity  toward  broad  adoption  of  these  principles  in  the  classroom  and  in  free- 
choice learning venues. 
• Smithsonian  Institution’s  Ocean  Initiative  (OI):  NOAA  has  made  a  significant 
commitment  to  support  the  OI.  Major  NOAA-Smithsonian  partnership  efforts 
include, a national exhibition on the ocean at the National Museum of Natural 
History—the  Ocean  Hall  and  a  virtual  extension  of  the  exhibit  through  an 
Ocean Web Portal. The mission of the OI is to advance scientific understanding 
of the ocean and increase public awareness of its importance to all life. It is ex-
pected that over 6 million visitors will visit the Ocean Hall and over 10 million 
visitors will experience the Ocean Web Portal every year.

70 

• Coastal  Ecosystem  Learning  Centers  (CELC)  Network:  In  partnership  with 
Coastal America, NOAA is working with the CELC Network to educate and in-
volve  the  public  in  protecting  our  Nation’s  coastal  and  ocean  ecosystems.  For 
example, NOAA’s ‘‘Ocean Today’’ kiosk (a continuously updated interface to the 
latest  ocean  discoveries  &  originally  developed  for  the  Smithsonian’s  Ocean 
Hall)  is  being  pilot  tested  in  five  CELCs  for  possible  wider  use  within  the  net-
work. 

• Science On a Sphere (SOS) Collaborative Network: NOAA has created a collabo-
rative network of more than 30 informal science education institutions and uni-
versities  interested  in  the  development  of  spherical  display  technologies  for 
showing  current  data  about  Earth  processes.  Most  of  these  partners  have  cre-
ated  public  exhibits  around  NOAA’s  Science  On  a  Sphere  and  are  evaluating 
the impact it has on the audience. Through this network NOAA promotes shar-
ing of best practices and content for these data visualization systems, and solic-
its  feedback  on  how  to  improve  its  data  products  for  the  informal  science  edu-
cation community. 

Question 4a. I understand that the cost of fully implementing the Magnuson-Ste-
vens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is expected to be, at minimum, $75 
million for FY 2009. Is this correct? 

Answer.  The  cost  of  fully  implementing  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Reauthorization 
Act (MSRA) in FY 2009 is $45.3 million, the amount requested in NOAA’s FY 2009 
Budget request. This is an increase of $31.8 million over the $13.5 million provided 
in  FY  2008.  The  $45.3  million  will  fully  meet  the  FY  2009  requirements  necessary 
to  fulfill  the  top  MSRA  priorities  of  ending  overfishing,  implementing  widespread 
market-based fishery management, and increasing international cooperation. 

Question 4b. Is the $31.8 million requested in the President’s FY 2009 budget for 
Magnuson-Stevens  implementation  sufficient  to  achieve  the  mandates  set  forth  in 
the Act by 2011? 

Answer.  NOAA’s  requests  over  the  last  few  years  have  been  increasing  in  order 
to  meet  the  highest  priority  MSRA  requirements.  In  FY  2008  Congress  provided 
NOAA $13.5 million for MSRA and closely related items, a decrease of $16.6 million 
compared  to  the  President’s  budget.  This  year,  we  are  requesting  an  additional 
$31.8 million for a total of $45.3 million to continue MSRA implementation. 

The NOAA FY 2009 budget request focuses on the top MSRA priorities of ending 
overfishing  by  2011,  implementing  widespread  market-based  fishery  management, 
and increasing international cooperation. 

The  FY  2009  budget  request  will  help  end  overfishing  by  ensuring  that  annual 
catch  limits  (ACLs)  are  put  into  place.  The  request  supports  widespread  market- 
based  fishery  management  through  the  increased  use  of  limited  access  programs, 
and will support increased international cooperation on issues such as illegal, unre-
ported,  and  unregulated  fishing  and  international  agreements  as  mandated  by  the 
MSRA. 

Question 4c. How does NOAA plan to fulfill the mandates set forth in the Magnu-

son-Stevens Act with inadequate funding? 

Answer. The $45.3 million in the FY 2009 request for MSRA implementation will 
keep NOAA on pace to meet the 2010/2011 deadlines for ending overfishing and es-
tablishing Annual Catch Limits. 

Question  5a.  The  effects  of  marine  debris  on  coral  reefs  are  particularly  evident 
in  the  Northwestern  Hawaiian  Islands,  which  include  69  percent  of  all  U.S.  coral 
reefs  by  area.  While  I  am  happy  to  see  that  the  President  has  included  $4  million 
for  the  NOAA  Marine  Debris  program  in  the  FY  2009  request,  do  you  feel  that, 
given  the  scope  of  this  issue,  the  request  sufficiently  addresses  this  pressing  issue? 
Answer.  The  President’s  Budget  request  for  $4  million  will  allow  the  NOAA  Ma-
rine  Debris  Program  to  address  the  most  pressing  issues  of  marine  debris  through 
several  different  avenues,  including  funding  assessment  and  research  projects,  re-
moval  projects,  and  outreach  and  education  activities.  All  of  these  are  done  in  con-
junction  with  other  organizations  and  research  facilities,  so  we  can  leverage  the 
amount  of  funding  received  from  Congress.  We  are  also  beginning  to  better  coordi-
nate Federal activities and needs to achieve more by capitalizing on each other’s ac-
tivities. 

Question 5b. As part of the enacted Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Re-
duction  Act,  Congress  instructed  the  NOAA  to  create  a  Federal  Information  Clear-
inghouse  to  provide  information  about  the  potential  sources  of  Marine  Debris.  Can 
you  confirm  that  the  NOAA  is  working  toward  implementing  this  database  in  ac-
cordance with all of the requirements contained in the Act? 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

71 

Answer.  The  President’s  FY  2009  Budget  Request  provides  NOAA  funds  to  start 
the  development  and  implementation  of  the  Federal  Information  Clearinghouse,  as 
required  by  the  Marine  Debris  Research,  Prevention,  and  Reduction  Act.  NOAA  is 
working  toward  implementing  this  data  base,  and  to  date  has  been  engaged  in  the 
planning  and  scoping  for  the  Clearinghouse.  A  public-use  version  is  expected  to  be-
come available in FY 2010. 

Question  6a.  There  is  growing  public  interest  in  and  support  for  marine  sanc-
tuaries to protect and conserve valuable marine resources and ecosystems. Is NOAA 
able  to  meet  the  management  and  conservation  needs  at  existing  sanctuaries  with 
the proposed budget level? 

Answer. The President’s FY 2009 Budget Request provides a total of $49.9 million 
for  the  13  national  marine  sanctuaries  and  the  Papaha¯naumokua¯kea  Marine  Na-
tional  Monument.  With  these  funds,  NOAA  is  able  to  meet  the  management  and 
conservation needs of our existing sanctuaries. The National Marine Sanctuary Sys-
tem  encompasses  over  18,000  square  miles  of  waters  and  marine  habitats,  and  in-
creases  our  knowledge  and  understanding  of  complex  marine  ecosystems.  With  the 
increasing environmental pressures on our Nation’s coastal areas, the importance of 
maintaining a system of marine protected areas is evident. 

Question  6b.  If  the  proposed  sanctuary  expansions  become  Federal  law,  can  you 
ensure  that  the  additional  resources  needed  for  these  sanctuaries  will  not  have  a 
negative  impact  on  the  management  and  conservation  of  the  existing  areas  within 
the National Marine Sanctuary System? 

Answer.  NOAA  will  work  to  ensure  that  existing  sanctuaries  are  not  adversely 
impacted, should the proposed sanctuary expansions (Gulf of the Farallones, Cordell 
Bank, and Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuaries) be enacted. 

Question 7. Admiral Lautenbacher, I want to thank you for your service to NOAA 
for  the  past  7  years.  Reflecting  on  your  service,  what  would  you  identify  as  the  top 
challenges  facing  the  NOAA  now  and  in  the  future?  How  do  you  hope  to  address 
these challenges? 

Answer. NOAA faces many challenges as the country becomes more dependent on 

the products and services we provide. 

Internally,  we  have  tried  to  break  down  stovepipes  that  existed  between  our  dif-
ferent  line  offices  and  have  instituted  a  rigorous  budget  process  that  directly  links 
funding  to  outcomes.  Through  this  process,  we  identify  specific  needs  of  the  Amer-
ican public and are able to bring to bear all of our expertise throughout the agency 
to meet those needs. 

An  Organic  Act  will  give  statutory  guidance  to  the  Agency  and  will  give  future 

NOAA leaders the tools they need to meet those goals. 

NOAA continues to be challenged to improve the transition from research to oper-
ations.  As  an  operational  agency,  NOAA  has  to  ensure  that  fundamental  research 
is focused on improving our operational capabilities. In some cases, such as our sat-
ellite program, this means improving working relationships across agencies as we’ve 
been  doing  with  NASA.  But  often,  it  means  simply  breaking  down  historic  barriers 
between our researchers and our operational staff. 

With  climate  variability  and  change  profoundly  influencing  economic  prosperity, 
human health, and national security, NOAA stands committed to providing the pub-
lic  with  relevant  and  reliable  climate  information  in  support  of  policy  decisions  in 
government  and  the  private  sector.  To  this  end,  NOAA  will  seek  to  leverage  its  re-
search  portfolio,  monitoring  capacity,  and  operational  infrastructure  with  those  ca-
pabilities of its partners. 

Despite  these  challenges,  NOAA  is  made  up  of  more  than  12,000  people  who  be-
lieve  deeply  in  the  agency  and  its  mission.  I  have  every  reason  to  believe  they  will 
continue to rise to meet the challenge as they have always done in the past. 

Question  8.  NOAA  is  charged  with  collecting  data  to  help  the  public  understand, 
plan  for,  and  respond  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  In  light  of  a  recent  study 
indicating  that  the  Federal  Government’s  efforts  fall  short  in  this  regard,  how  will 
you ensure that NOAA’s climate data and services are accessible and useful to deci-
sionmakers, especially at the local level? 

Answer.  NOAA’s  National  Data  Centers  for  Climate,  Geophysics,  Oceans  and 
Coasts  work  very  closely  with  the  climate  science  community  to  ensure  the  data 
they  archive  is  readily  available  to  support  deliberation  and  action  by  decision-
makers at international, national, regional, and local levels. 

NOAA received a 2007 report from the National Academy of Sciences entitled: En-
vironmental  Data  Management  at  NOAA:  Archiving,  Stewardship,  and  Access. 
NOAA  is  developing  the  necessary  management  and  business  processes  to  imple-
ment  the  nine  recommendations  from  this  report.  NOAA’s  National  Data  Centers 
work  very  closely  with  regional  and  state  climatologists  to  ensure  data  are  fully 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

72 

available  to  them  to  support  customized  climate  products  that  are  useful  at  these 
levels. 

Looking to the future, concurrently with the NOAA satellite acquisition programs, 
NOAA’s  National  Data  Centers  have  been  developing  and  implementing  the  next 
generation data archive and access infrastructure—the Comprehensive Large Array- 
data  Stewardship  System  (CLASS).  CLASS  will  ensure  that  NOAA  will  be  able  to 
deliver  the  large-sized  complex  climate  data  and  products  derived  from  these  next 
generation satellite systems to users in a timely manner. The Administration recog-
nizes the importance of providing continuity of data from high-priority climate sen-
sors  to  the  climate  science  community.  Included  in  the  overall  strategy  is  an  ele-
ment  focused  on  the  stewardship  of  climate  data  records  that  would  be  funded 
through the President’s FY 2009 Budget Request for climate sensors. 

Finally,  data  from  NOAA’s  Data  Centers  are  currently  being  incorporated  in 
monthly,  seasonal,  and  annual  climate  assessments,  drought  outlook  products,  and 
ocean climatology products, as well as many other climate data products. Full fund-
ing of the President’s FY 2009 Budget Request for NOAA’s Data Centers and Infor-
mation Services will ensure that NOAA’s National Data Centers continue to provide 
these valuable services to regional and local climate data users and continue to de-
velop the necessary processes to deliver future higher resolution data. 

Question  9.  Admiral  Lautenbacher,  it  has  come  to  my  attention  that  the  Pacific 
Region is the only Weather Service Region whose Director is not a Senior Executive 
Service  member,  also  known  as  a  ‘‘SES.’’  Why  is  this  position  not  a  SES  position? 
Does NOAA plan to make this a SES position? 

Answer.  Jack  Hayes,  Director  of  the  National  Weather  Service  for  only  the  past 
9 months, is evaluating his corporate leadership and their roles and responsibilities. 
He  is  working  with  NOAA’s  Workforce  Management  Office  and  NOAA’s  Operating 
Executive  Resources  Board  to  evaluate  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Pacific 
Region Director to determine if these roles and responsibilities meet the criteria for 
the Senior Executive Service. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C. LAUTENBACHER, JR. 

Question  1a.  The  Administration’s  proposed  NOAA  budget  is  an  increase  of  5.2 
percent  over  the  FY08  enacted  level.  All  of  this  increase,  however,  goes  toward  the 
satellites  acquisition  program,  with  the  National  Ocean  Service,  National  Marine 
Fisheries Service, and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research all receiving cuts. Are the 
satellite program’s cost increases eating away at our Nation’s oceans programs? 

Answer.  NOAA  has  a  diverse  mission  ranging  from  managing  fisheries  to  pre-
dicting severe weather. The Administration’s request provides a balanced set of pri-
orities  to  sustain  core  mission  services  and  address  our  highest  priority  program 
needs.  Even  within  a  restrained  fiscal  environment,  however,  the  President’s  FY 
2009  Budget  Request  includes  over  $49  million  over  the  prior  year  request  in  in-
creases  in  support  of  the  President’s  Ocean  Initiative.  $21  million  is  new  funding 
over the prior year request that directly supports the additional requirements of the 
reauthorized  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act.  As  in 
the past, NOAA will continue to work within the Administration and with Congress 
to ensure the needs of ocean, coastal and fisheries program are addressed. 

Question  1b.  Are  the  satellite  cost  increases  presenting  a  significant  budget  chal-
lenge  for  NOAA?  How  are  they  impacting  your  ability  to  support  NOAA’s  other 
agencies? 

Answer.  Although  satellite  cost  increases  continue  to  present  a  significant  chal-
lenge  for  NOAA,  we  have  an  extensive  planning  process  that  ensures  the  highest 
priorities are addressed in our annual budget request, and that all programs receive 
appropriate  funding.  We  have  not  cut  or  taxed  other  programs  to  fund  increases  in 
satellites,  and  we  work  continuously  within  the  Administration  and  with  Congress 
to  create  a  balanced  portfolio  of  programs  to  address  the  Nation’s  most  critical 
needs. 

Question  2a.  The  2010  Census  has  recently  experienced  major  cost  overruns  and 
acquisition problems. In April, these problems prompted Secretary Gutie´rrez to sub-
mit a plan to Congress, including a request to transfer $232 million in FY 2008 from 
other  agencies  (including  $27  million  from  NOAA)  to  the  Census  Bureau.  Addition-
ally,  up  to  $700  million  more  will  be  needed  in  FY  2009  and  $2.1  billion  between 
2010 and 2013. 

Admiral,  were  you  aware  of  Secretary  Gutie´rrez’s  plan  to  transfer  $27  million 

from NOAA this year before he presented this plan to Congress?

Answer. Yes, in terms of timing, but it was not a plan to transfer $27 million from 
NOAA.  The  Administration  requested  increased  statutory  authority  to  transfer 
funds to the Census Bureau, and provided a list showing the universe of candidates 
that  might  be  transferred  in  the  event  that  Congress  provided  the  authority.  The 
list showed that the Department had unrequested funds, including NOAA funds, in 
excess  of  the  maximum  estimated  need  for  the  Census  Bureau.  But  the  minimum 
estimated  need  was  some  $70  million  less,  so  there  was  a  substantial  likelihood 
from  the  start  that  a  transfer  of  NOAA  funds  would  not  be  necessary.  The  actual 
need  turned  out  to  be  $156  million,  not  $232  million,  so  even  if  Congress  had  pro-
vided the requested authority the Department could have met that need without in-
cluding any NOAA funds in a subsequent transfer proposal. 

Question  2b.  Were  you  or  anyone  else  in  NOAA  consulted  on  where  from  within 

NOAA these funds should come from? 

Answer.  Current  statutory  authority  does  not  permit  the  Department  to  transfer 
funds from NOAA to another bureau. Had Congress provided the requested author-
ity to allow such a transfer, NOAA certainly would have been consulted on whether 
to  use  NOAA  funds  as  a  source  and,  if  so,  which  funds.  NOAA  was  not  consulted 
on the Department-wide candidate list. 

Question 2c. If Secretary Gutie´rrez has his way, where from within NOAA would 

these funds come from? 

Answer.  The  candidate  list  consisted  of  appropriations  that  the  President  did  not 
request or that exceeded the requested level, and that were not identified in the list 
of Congressional earmarks and Congressionally-directed spending items that accom-
panied the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. 

Question  3a.  In  a  hearing  last  month  before  the  House  Appropriations  Sub-
committee  on  Commerce,  Justice,  and  Science,  you  testified  that  certain  divisions 
of NOAA have had to delay hiring due to budget constraints. You identified the Na-
tional  Weather  Service  as  being  most  affected,  although  other  parts  of  NOAA  have 
also  been  affected.  The  proposed  budget  for  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service 
is  $46.8  million  less  than  the  2008  enacted  level.  How  many  positions  within  the 
agency will go unfilled in 2009 because of this budget? 

Answer. Although the President’s FY 2009 Budget Request for NMFS is under the 
FY  2008  enacted  levels,  this  is  primarily  due  to  the  exclusion  of  Congressionally- 
directed  projects  not  requested  by  the  Administration.  At  this  time,  and  outside  of 
being  consistent  with  prior  year  lapse  rates  for  hiring  staff,  NOAA  does  not  antici-
pate that any additional positions will go unfilled for FY 2009. 

Question 3b. What effect will these vacancies have on NOAA’s ability to fulfill the 

requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act? 

Answer. In FY 2008 Congress provided NOAA about $13.5 million for the Magnu-
son-Stevens  Reauthorization  Act  (MSRA).  For  FY  2009,  we  are  requesting  an  addi-
tional $31.8 million above the FY 2008 enacted amount. The NOAA FY 2009 budget 
request  focuses  on  the  top  MSRA  priorities  of  ending  overfishing  by  2011,  imple-
menting  widespread  market-based  fishery  management,  and  increasing  inter-
national cooperation. 

NOAA  does  not  have  the  capacity  to  efficiently  meet  all  the  new  MSRA  require-
ments  in  1  year.  However,  the  FY  2009  NOAA  budget  request  provides  adequate 
funding  to  fulfill  the  top  MSRA  priorities  of  ending  overfishing  by  2011,  imple-
menting  widespread  market-based  fishery  management,  and  increasing  inter-
national cooperation. We are phasing in the funding increases to match our capacity 
to meet the new requirements. As stated above, we do not anticipate any vacancies 
related to the FY 2008 funding levels. 

Question  3c.  The  National  Ocean  Service  and  Office  of  Atmospheric  Research  are 
also  slated  to  incur  budget  decreases.  How  will  these  budget  decreases  impact  hir-
ing? 

Answer.  For  both  the  National  Ocean  Service  and  the  Office  of  Atmospheric  Re-
search,  the  FY  2008  Omnibus  bill  reduced  funding  for  a  number  of  core  base  pro-
grams. NOAA has taken a number of steps to absorb these reductions, including de-
ferring  program  improvements,  delaying  or  terminating  contract  actions,  deferring 
research  grants,  and  delaying  hiring  for  noncritical  positions.  NOAA  is  a  labor  in-
tensive  organization  with  over  12,000  employees  and  25  percent  of  its  operating 
budget  allocated  to  personnel-related  costs.  The  full  FY  2009  President’s  Budget  is 
critical for avoiding such actions in the future. 

Question  4a.  Because  of  historically  low  salmon  returns,  the  states  of  California, 
Oregon,  and  Washington  are  now  experiencing  the  largest  fishery  closure  in  U.S. 
history. In 2006, an estimated 800,000 Chinook salmon returned to the Sacramento 
River;  but  this  year,  estimates  are  that  less  than  90,000  will  return.  There  is  de-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

74 

bate,  however,  whether  these  poor  salmon  returns  are  due  to  poor  oceanographic 
conditions  or  poor  salmon  conservation.  What  is  NOAA’s  science  telling  us  so  far? 
Is  it  possible  that  the  poor  oceanographic  conditions  might  be  linked  to  climate 
change? 

Answer.  The  ocean  conditions  necessary  for  the  survival  of  young  salmon  are 
linked  to  the  circulation  of  ocean  currents,  particularly  currents  that  cause 
upwelling  of  cold,  nutrient  rich  waters  to  the  surface.  The  strength  and  location  of 
these  currents  varies  from  season  to  season  and  year  to  year.  Longer-term  changes 
in  climate  also  affect  the  wind  patterns  and  ocean  currents.  Both  short-term  vari-
ation and long-term climate change will affect the ocean conditions critical to salm-
on survival. However, separating the relative effects of these two influences is spec-
ulative without a long-term record. 

Question 4b. Do NOAA’s climate, ocean, and fisheries research programs have the 
resources  needed  to  gather  the  data  necessary  to  definitively  explain  the  cause  for 
this disaster? If so, then what is the definitive explanation? 

Answer. NOAA is leading the way in establishing Ocean Observation Systems for 
the  purpose  of  collecting  and  analyzing  data  that  will  help  answer  this  question. 
These  data  have  been  collected  sporadically  in  some  areas  in  the  past,  but  com-
prehensive  observations  will  greatly  enhance  our  understanding  of  ocean  processes 
and  their  influence  on  living  marine  resources.  Funding  of  this  work  is  included  in 
the  NOAA  budget,  and  continues  to  be  furnished  through  the  cooperation  of  many 
partners  in  the  ocean  science  community,  including  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion.  More  time  is  required  to  amass  the  observations  and  to  monitor  longer-term 
cyclic changes before NOAA will be able to provide a definitive explanation. 

Question  5a.In  response  to  low  salmon  returns  in  2006,  $60.4  million  in  disaster 
assistance was provided to salmon fishermen in Oregon and California. These funds 
were given to the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission to administer a grant 
program  for  fishermen  and  businesses  affected  by  the  salmon  closure.  If  and  when 
Congress  provides  disaster  relief  for  the  salmon  fisheries,  do  you  anticipate  NOAA 
would  use  the  same  mechanism  for  distributing  the  funds  that  was  used  for  the 
2006 salmon disaster? 

Answer.  Yes,  NOAA  intends  to  partner  with  the  Pacific  States  Marine  Fisheries 
Commission  to  administer  funding  for  the  salmon  disaster  if  funds  are  made  avail-
able.  The  2006  distribution  was  made  according  to  plans  developed  by  the  affected 
states (Oregon and California), and was implemented through the Pacific States Ma-
rine  Fisheries  Commission.  NOAA  ensured  that  the  plans  developed  by  the  states 
were  consistent  with  Congressional  intent,  and  issued  the  funds  as  a  grant  to  the 
Commission  for  distribution  in  accordance  with  the  state  plans.  At  this  point,  the 
states  have  not  yet  completed  their  2008  plans.  As  a  result,  we  do  not  have  their 
specific  recommendations  for  distribution  of  the  funds.  NOAA  is  maintaining  reg-
ular  contact  with  liaisons  in  each  of  the  Governors’  Offices.  With  their  agreement, 
NOAA intends to follow a similar mechanism this year. 

Question  5b.  What  are  some  lessons  learned  from  past  distributions  during  fish-

Once  the  plans  were  in  place,  NOAA  was  able  to  move  the  funds  quickly  and  in 

a way that assured we had effective tracking and accountability. 

This experience also demonstrated the importance of developing clear and detailed 
standards, such as who should receive funds and the qualifying years of fishing, for 
those who may qualify for a share of the funding. 

In  general,  the  2006  fishery  disaster  process  went  well  but  there  was  some  dis-
pute  about  the  standards  developed  by  the  states,  and  how  individual  applicants 
qualified for particular amounts of funding. 

We  expect  that  the  standards  now  being  developed  by  the  states  for  distribution 

of the FY 2008 funds will be informed by the 2006 fishery disaster process. 

Finally,  when  the  immediate  income  needs  of  the  fishing  communities  were  met, 
additional  funding  still  remained.  While  there  were  a  number  of  potential  uses  for 
that  funding  (to  help  restore  the  fishery  or  prevent  a  similar  failure  in  the  future), 
those uses were, for the most part, not a part of the initial 2006 plans. In this year’s 
distribution,  we  seek  to  ensure  that  plans  allow  for  the  best  use  of  any  funds  re-
maining after the immediate needs have been addressed. 

The  fact  that  there  have  been  two  such  distributions  in  a  fairly  short  period  of 
time  serves  as  a  reminder  that,  while  distributions  can  be  effective  in  providing 
short-term  income  support.  it  is  also  vital  to  identify  the  underlying  causes  of  the 
fishery failure, and, where possible, invest in long-term solutions. 

eries disasters? 

Answer. The first important lesson was confirmation that the proposed method of 

distribution of funds in 2006 was effective and accountable.

Question  6a.  At  the  July  2007  hearing  on  the  NOAA  satellites  program,  I  ex-
pressed  my  concerns  about  the  many  climate  sensors  that  were  cut  from  the  Na-
tional  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  System.  I’m  happy  to  see 
that  this  year’s  budget  request  includes  $74  million  to  add  several  of  these  climate 
sensors  back  in.  How  important  is  it  that  NOAA  get  this  funding  for  the  climate 
sensors? 

Answer.  It  is  extremely  important  to  NOAA  and  the  national  and  international 
climate  science  community  that  NOAA  receive  timely  and  full  funding  of  the  $74 
million for the Climate Sensor/Climate Data Record initiative. The $74 million con-
tinues  the  Administration’s  efforts  to  restore  the  five  high  priority  climate  instru-
ments  that  were  demanifested  from  the  National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Envi-
ronmental Satellite System (NPOESS) in 2006, and to address the recommendation 
of  the  National  Academies  of  Sciences  Decadal  Survey  Report  (2007)  to  restore  key 
climate and environmental sensors. 

The $74 million budget increase in FY 2009 will fund development of Total Solar 
Irradiance  Sensor  (TSIS)  and  Clouds  and  Earth  Radiant  Energy  System  (CERES), 
and  provide  for  Climate  Sensor/Climate  Data  Record  development  and  continuity. 
NOAA  and  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  previously 
jointly  funded  restoration  of  Ozone  Mapper/Profiler  Suite-Limb  onto  the  NPOESS 
Preparatory  Project  (NPP)  satellite.  However,  full  funding  of  the  NPOESS-related 
budget  requests  in  the  NASA,  NOAA  and  Air  Force  appropriations  bills  is  also  re-
quired  to  ensure  the  climate  sensors  can  be  integrated  and  launched  on  the  NPP 
and  NPOESS  satellites.  By  launching  these  sensors  on  existing  spacecraft,  NOAA 
takes  advantage  of  pre-existing  launch  opportunities  on  NPP  and  NPOESS.  NOAA 
must  receive  these  funds  by  October  1,  2008  to  meet  the  schedule  for  CERES  and 
TSIS to be integrated onto NPP and NPOESS, respectively, and still meet scheduled 
launch dates. 

Question  6b.  What  would  be  the  impact  if  Congress  were  to  not  fully  fund  this 

Answer. If NOAA does not receive full funding at the $74 million level by October 
1,  2008,  current  acquisition  and  development  activities  will  be  canceled  and  NOAA 
will  not  be  able  to  develop  TSIS  and  CERES  in  time  for  the  respective  NPP  and 
the first NPOESS satellite (C–1) launch. Further, NOAA would be forced to readjust 
current  long  lead  planning  to  continue  development  of  climate  sensors  for  future 
spacecraft. NOAA would readjust the Climate Data Record component of the initia-
tive  which  would  diminish  the  availability  of  these  data  to  national  and  inter-
national  climate  scientists.  National  decision-makers  would  not  have  the  required 
information to develop the necessary policy (such as Congressional legislation, Presi-
dential directives, or State action) to appropriately respond to global climate change. 
Finally,  international  bodies  such  as  the  United  Nations  would  not  have  the  data 
to  support  the  necessary  multilateral  dialogue  to  develop  global  consensus  on  the 
appropriate actions required to address climate change. 

Question 6c. Would it hurt NOAA’s ability to monitor global warming and the on-

going changes to our planet’s climate? 

Answer. Not receiving the FY 2009 budget increase of $74 million to fund develop-
ment  of  TSIS,  CERES,  and  associated  climate  data  records  and  not  receiving  full 
funding of the NPOESS-related budget requests in the NASA, NOAA and Air Force 
appropriations  bills  would  hinder  NOAA’s  ability  to  monitor  on-going  and  future 
changes of the global climate after current missions expire. 

Question  6d.  Would  it  reduce  your  ability  to  replace  our  current  sensors  without 

request? 

use it? 

a gap in climate monitoring? 

Answer.  6d.  Without  funding  to  develop  demanifested  climate  sensors  and  to  de-
velop the Climate Data Record initiative on NPP and NPOESS, there will be a sig-
nificant gap in our ability to monitor the climate. 

Question 6e. If you got more than $74 million for climate sensors, how would you 

Answer.  Based  on  the  current  portfolio  of  satellite  acquisition  activities  that 
NOAA,  NASA  and  the  Air  Force  are  pursuing,  it  would  be  very  difficult  to  absorb 
and  effectively  use  any  additional  funds  above  the  FY  2009  President’s  Budget  Re-
quest.  The  President’s  FY  2009  Budget  Request  does  assume  continued  funding  of 
Climate  Sensor/Climate  Data  Record  development  in  FY  2010  and  beyond  to  con-
tinue these efforts. 

Question  7a.  What  impacts  does  the  reduced  funding  for  the  NOAA  Office  of  Re-

sponse and Restoration have on our Nation’s oil spill response capabilities? 

Answer.  The  FY  2008  enacted  appropriation  for  NOAA  provides  $11.5  million  for 
response  and  restoration  base  activities;  this  amount  is  $5.3  million  below  the  FY 
2008 requested level. Specific impacts include a reduction in:

76 

• Capacity  to  respond  to  two  simultaneous  medium  spill  events  (which  has  oc-
curred  on  two  occasions  over  the  past  5  years)  or  one  large  spill,  such  as  the 
EXXON VALDEZ or Hurricane Katrina. 
• Developing  and  updating  oil  prediction  models,  3-dimensional  models,  Environ-
mental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps, and socioeconomic valuation tools. For ex-
ample, some of the ESI maps are more than 25 years old. 
• Conducting and participating in preparedness and response training and drills, 
such  as  the  highly  successful  Safe  Seas  Exercises  that  contribute  so  effectively 
to elevating response capacity at the regional level. 

Question 7b. At these funding levels, does NOAA have the ability to fully respond 

to two major oil spills simultaneously? 

Answer. It is important that NOAA’s Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) 
receive  the  President’s  request  of  $17.3  million  in  FY  2009  in  order  to  help  rebuild 
core capabilities that have diminished over the past 4 years. At the FY 2008 enacted 
appropriation  of  $11.5  million,  OR&R  has  limited  capacity  to  respond  to  two  major 
oil  spills  simultaneously,  without  taking  measures  such  as  temporarily  reassigning 
from other NOAA programs, or recalling retired personnel. Without such measures, 
the  level  of  response  OR&R  would  be  able  to  provide,  including  scientific  support, 
on-scene responders, and damage assessment, would be very limited. 

Question 8a. NOAA’s oil spill response office currently has a backlog of its ecologi-
cal sensitivity maps. These maps are used in decision-making during spill responses 
to decide which environmentally sensitive areas to protect. 

During  the  COSCO  BUSAN  oil  spill  in  San  Francisco,  responders  relied  on 
NOAA’s ecological sensitivity maps to identify areas that needed protection from the 
spreading oil. NOAA’s maps for the outer coast of Washington, though, are twenty- 
three years old and severely outdated. By relying on outdated maps, aren’t we risk-
ing our ability to respond effectively to a spill on the Washington coast? 

Answer. It is true that the Washington Coast atlases are among the oldest in the 
country,  but  this  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  these  maps  are  outdated.  Older 
maps  can  still  provide  useful  information  and  NOAA  continues  to  use  these  maps 
during response events. 

Question  8b.  If  Congress  funds  the  Office  of  Response  and  Restoration  at  levels 
dramatically  below  the  President’s  request  like  we  did  last  year,  isn’t  it  a  safe  as-
sumption  that  the  ecological  sensitivity  map  backlog  will  grow?  How  much  will  it 
cost to update all of the maps that need to be updated? 

Answer.  Appropriations  below  the  President’s  request  have  led  to  an  increase  in 
the  Environmental  Sensitivity  Index  (ESI)  backlog.  Funding  ESI  maps  has  most 
often  been  accomplished  by  using  a  variety  of  funding  sources,  both  Federal  and 
state.  Funding  at  the  FY  2009  budget  request  level  will  allow  NOAA  to  update  1 
ESI atlas. 

Question 9a. During the recent Coast Guard budget hearing, Admiral Allen testi-
fied  that  he  is  uncertain  of  the  Coast  Guard’s  ability  to  respond  to  oil  spills  in  the 
Arctic.  He  even  went  so  far  as  to  question  whether  the  Coast  Guard’s  ships  and 
planes  can  even  operate  in  Arctic  conditions.  Do  you  believe  that  our  Nation  cur-
rently  has  the  capabilities  to  effectively  respond  to  a  major  oil  spill  in  the  Arctic 
Ocean? 

Answer. The vast majority of the pollution response equipment in the U.S. Arctic 
Region  belongs  to  Alaska  Clean  Seas  and  the  petroleum  industry.  While  these  pre- 
positioned  caches  provide  a  capability  to  respond  to  most  spills,  a  prolonged  clean- 
up operation would require transporting resources (i.e., human, mechanical, etc.) to 
the impacted area from outside of the region. 

NOAA’s  role  in  spill  response  comprises  of  scientific  support  and  damage  assess-
ment.  Currently,  NOAA’s  capability  to  perform  this  role  in  the  Arctic  is  challenged 
by  limited  experience  working  in  oil-in-ice  conditions  and  limited  environmental 
baseline  information  in  terms  of  both  biological  densities  and  environmental  sen-
sitivities  of  resources  for  damage  assessment.  However,  given  current  vessel  traffic 
in the Arctic Ocean, the likelihood of a major spill in that region is remote. As vessel 
traffic  in  the  Arctic  Ocean  increases  and  the  likelihood  of  major  spills  grows  less 
remote, Federal agencies responsible for responding to such spills will adapt. 

Question  9b.  Do  we  have  the  scientific  knowledge  necessary  to  know  how  to  re-

spond effectively to oil spills in the Arctic? 

Answer.  NOAA  and  U.S.  Coast  Guard  continue  to  develop  and  acquire  the  nec-
essary  expertise  to  respond  effectively  to  spills 
in  Arctic  conditions.  The 
SELENDANG AYU (2004) spill off of Unalaska, Alaska, represents the type of spill 
the  U.S.  would  be  facing  in  the  Bering  Sea  region,  as  well  as  the  Beaufort  and 
Chukchi  Seas.  NOAA  has  the  expertise  on  the  current  state-of-the-art  in  response 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00080 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

77 

techniques and is working with the international research and development commu-
nity to improve predictive capabilities for oil-in-ice scenarios. NOAA’s work on spills 
like the SELENDANG AYU clearly identifies additional information required to un-
derstand how oil released into the Arctic weathers the processes by which oil lingers 
in the environment, and how these processes ultimately result in injuries to the bio-
logical and ecological resources in these environments. 

Question  9c.  What  steps  is  NOAA  taking  to  prepare  us  for  major  oil  spills  in  the 

Arctic? 

Answer.  NOAA  is  proactively  looking  at  plausible  spill  scenarios  that  we  might 
face in the Arctic. NOAA is working with the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and 
U.S. Coast Guard to define these scenarios. A NOAA-sponsored workshop took place 
in  March  2008  to  start  defining  these  scenarios  and  to  develop  data-gaps  and  re-
search needs in order to improve response capabilities. NOAA is strengthening these 
partnerships and looking for opportunities to leverage resources to improve response 
capabilities. In addition, NOAA is attempting to increase the education and informa-
tion base for potential Arctic responders. For increased access to pertinent informa-
tion before and during an oil spill response, NOAA has developed a new high resolu-
tion environmental information system that can access both static data (like biologi-
cal  sensitivities  and  shoreline  characteristics)  as  well  as  real-time  data  from  moni-
toring  stations  (like  weather  and  currents).  Appropriation  of  the  President’s  FY 
2009  Budget  Request  would  allow  NOAA  to  make  progress  on  the  development  of 
this system. 

Question 10a. In a letter commenting on the Environmental Impact Statement for 
the  Chukchi  Sea  oil  and  gas  drilling  plan,  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service 
wrote  that  the  Minerals  Management  Service’s  analysis  ‘‘did  not  present  a  strong 
enough case to NMFS that marine resources would be adequately protected.’’ Do you 
support your agency’s assessment that the Minerals Management Service’s plan for 
oil  and  gas  drilling  in  the  Arctic  Ocean’s  Chukchi  Sea  does  not  adequately  protect 
marine resources and ecosystems? 

Answer.  The  NOAA  Fisheries  Service’s  letter,  dated  January  30,  2007,  presented 
comments  on  the  Minerals  Management  Service’s  (MMS)  draft  Environmental  Im-
pact  Statement  for  the  Chukchi  Sea  Planning  Area—Oil  and  Gas  Lease  Sale  193 
and  Seismic  Surveying  Activities  in  the  Chukchi  Sea.  The  comment  letter  specifi-
cally  concerned  support  for  the  preferred  alternative  (Alternative  III),  and  whether 
the  DEIS  presented  a  strong  enough  case  to  justify  that  alternative  over  NOAA 
Fisheries’  recommendation  to  adopt  Alternative  IV.  While  NOAA  supported  Alter-
native  IV,  we  do  not  consider  the  adoption  of  Alternative  III  by  the  MMS  to  mean 
the process or conclusions of the EIS are unacceptable. The MMS employed the best 
available  scientific  data  in  preparing  the  DEIS.  Furthermore,  the  alternative  the 
MMS adopted excluded a sizable portion of the area we recommended for exclusion 
from the sale area. 

Where  appropriate  to  comply  with  the  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act,  NOAA 
Fisheries Service will issue letters of authorization or incidental harassment author-
izations on specific oil and gas activities in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to allow 
for  the  incidental  harassment  of  marine  mammals.  This  allows  NOAA  Fisheries 
Service  to  place  conditions  on  the  oil  and  gas  drilling  activities  which  may  result 
in  modification  to  operations.  These  conditions  are  added  to  ensure  that  the  effects 
of  the  drilling  and  production  activities  do  not  result  in  more  than  a  negligible  im-
pact on marine mammals in the area. NOAA Fisheries Service will develop our own 
NEPA  documentation  to  support  any  letter  of  authorization  or  incidental  harass-
ment authorization. 

NOAA  Fisheries  Service  will  continue  to  coordinate  with  the  MMS  as  production 

and development plans evolve. 

Question  10b.  Do  you  resent  the  fact  that  the  Minerals  Management  Service 
largely ignored your agency’s plea to adopt the more environmentally-sensitive drill-
ing plan for the Chukchi Sea? 

Answer. NOAA did not review a ‘‘drilling plan,’’ but rather an EIS for a lease sale 
which  encompasses  a  much  broader  range  of  issues  than  a  drill  plan.  NOAA  rec-
ommended  an  alternative  for  the  sale  plan  which  would  have  included  a  60  mile 
buffer  between  the  lease  sale  and  the  Alaska  Chukchi  coastline.  The  actual  bound-
aries  for  Sale  193  are  greater  than  60  miles  offshore  in  some  important  habitats, 
such as the Leydyard Bay critical habitat area, and are never closer than 25 miles. 
Thus, we cannot agree that our comments were largely ignored, although our stated 
preference  and  recommendation  was  for  the  60  mile  buffer.  NOAA  is  currently 
working  closely  with  the  MMS  to  reduce  impact  to  our  trust  resources  due  to  oil 
and gas exploration, and to complete research to answer many of the environmental 
issues raised in our letter.

Question  11a.  In  Washington  State,  we  have  recently  seen  the  emergence  of  the 
Puget Sound Partnership—an innovative, collaborative, science-based effort to man-
age  the  Puget  Sound  environment  based  on  an  ecosystem-based  management  ap-
proach.  Will  NOAA  invest  in  this  important  effort  in  Washington  State,  which  is 
already being seen throughout the country as a model for regional ocean governance 
and ecosystem-based management? 

Answer.  NOAA  is  currently  investing  funding  and  providing  staff  support  in 
Puget  Sound.  The  Director  of  the  Northwest  Fisheries  Science  Center,  who  is  a 
member of the Puget Sound Partnership’s Science Panel, is serving as NOAA’s lead 
for  the  Puget  Sound  Partnership’s  recovery  effort.  A  NOAA  Puget  Sound  Coordina-
tion  Group  has  also  been  formed  under  the  guidance  of  the  Director  of  the  North-
west  Fisheries  Science  Center.  The  Regional  Administrator  for  NOAA’s  National 
Marine Fisheries Service, Northwest Region is one of three Federal representatives 
on  the  Puget  Sound  Partnership’s  Ecosystem  Recovery  Board.  Additional  NOAA 
staff participates in other advisory groups in support of the Partnership. 

Question  11b.  In  my  state,  the  Puget  Sound  Partnership  is  making  a  major  push 
to restore Washington’s waters using a science and ecosystem-based approach. Isn’t 
this the kind of regional effort that you support and that should be replicated else-
where throughout the country? 

Answer.  NOAA  is  very  supportive  of  the  approach  being  taken  to  restore  Puget 
Sound  and  views  the  Puget  Sound  Partnership  as  one  of  the  model  efforts  in  the 
Nation for an ecosystem approach to management. 

Question 11c. Is it true that NOAA does not have funding available for participa-

tion in the Puget Sound Partnership? 

Answer.  In  the  years  2003  through  2007,  NOAA  expenditures  in  Puget  Sound 
across  all  line  offices  averaged  about  $27.4  million  annually,  including  habitat  res-
toration,  salmon  recovery,  contaminated  sediment  cleanup,  and  science.  Approxi-
mately $15.7 million annually was from the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. 
The  amount  for  2008  will  be  about  the  same,  while  the  NOAA’s  request  for  2009 
is lower, largely due to a reduction in the request for Pacific Coast Salmon Recovery 
funding. NOAA is working within the Puget Sound Federal Caucus to better coordi-
nate funding and actions from all Federal agencies, which will create some efficiency 
in carrying out this work. However, NOAA recognizes that moving to an ecosystem 
approach  to  management  will  require  scientific  and  management  resources  and  ex-
tensive coordination. For example, a Leadership Group composed of city and county 
elected  officials  from  the  Puget  Sound  region,  government  agency  representatives, 
tribes,  conservation  organizations,  and  private  industry  recently  completed  the  re-
covery  plan  for  Puget  Sound  Chinook.  This  plan  will  require  coordination  between 
many groups within the Puget Sound. 

As the Partnership develops its Action agenda over the next 6 months, NOAA will 
endeavor to assist the Partnership as much as possible and will work with the Part-
nership  and  the  Federal  Caucus  to  identify  those  actions  that  would  benefit  from 
NOAA’s  leadership  and  fiscal  support.  These  will  be  considered  as  the  Administra-
tion develops its outyear priorities and budget. 

Question 12. A small program called ‘‘Mussel Watch’’ may be cut under this year’s 
NOAA budget. This program monitors water quality and chemical contaminants by 
analyzing  mussel  tissues.  The  22-year-old  program  has  collected  data  on  over  120 
contaminants  along  Washington’s  shorelines,  and  has  been  instrumental  in  dem-
onstrating the Puget Sound’s toxic problems. Although the program is small, Mussel 
Watch is instrumental in monitoring water quality in Washington. Will NOAA con-
tinue support for this successful program? 

Answer.  NOAA  appreciates  your  concern  for  the  Mussel  Watch  Program,  and  we 
are  pleased  to  hear  of  the  program’s  value  to  your  state.  Because  Mussel  Watch  is 
funded  a  year  in  advance,  the  program  will  continue  through  FY  2009  using  FY 
2008 funds. Continued support will depend on the final appropriations for FY 2009. 
However, we continue to explore options, such as increased partnerships with state 
and local stakeholders, to maintain this important national observing program. 

Question 13a. In response to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, the Bush Adminis-
tration pledged $37.5 million toward expanding the U.S. Tsunami warning program 
to protect lives and property along all U.S. coasts. NOAA deployed the final two tsu-
nami detection buoys in the South Pacific this past March, completing the U.S. Tsu-
nami Warning System. Given the completion of the Pacific tsunami warning system, 
what grade would you give our current Tsunami Warning System? 

Answer. The U.S. Tsunami Warning System is highly effective. In May 2008, the 
Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  completed  a  Program  Assessment  Rating 
Tool  (PART)  on  NOAA’s  Tsunami  Monitoring,  Forecasting,  and  Warning  Program.

79 

OMB  gave  the  program  an  ‘‘effective’’  rating,  which  is  the  highest  score  a  program 
can receive. 

NOAA  has  made  tremendous  progress  in  just  31⁄2 years.  In  March  2008,  NOAA 
completed  the  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  System  strengthening  effort.  In  addition  to 
the  completed  deployment  of  39  Deep-ocean  Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunami 
(DART)  stations,  NOAA:  (1)  upgraded  120  and  installed  16  new  National  Water 
Level  Observation  Network  (NWLON)  tide  gauges  (for  a  total  of  136);  (2)  added  8 
new seismic stations and worked with partners, such as the U.S. Geological Survey 
to  enhance  the  Nation’s  seismic  networks;  (3)  developed  site-specific  inundation 
models;  (4)  upgraded  telecommunications  infrastructure;  and  (5)  expanded  oper-
ations  at  its  two  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  to  24  hours/day,  7  days/week.  Equally 
important  to  success  are  processing  systems,  warning  message  content  and  genera-
tion, communications to coastal communities, local response capability, and the pre- 
planning  at  the  local  level  which  includes  public  education,  warning  response,  and 
recovery. 

In the Pacific region, NOAA improved accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of tsu-
nami  detection.  NOAA’s  tsunami  observational  network  in  the  Pacific  includes  32 
DART  stations,  74  NWLON  tide  gauges,  and  8  seismic  stations.  NOAA  researchers 
and data managers also completed 22 site-specific inundation models. We made im-
provements  in  the  level  of  community  awareness,  preparedness,  response,  and  re-
covery capability as demonstrated through tsunami communication tests, evacuation 
drills, disaster planning, and public education. 

During  the  next  year,  NOAA’s  Tsunami  Warning  System  will  be  reviewed  by  the 
National  Academies  of  Science  to  determine  if  there  are  any  other  enhancements 
that  can  be  made  to  the  warning  system,  so  we  can  better  serve  coastal  residents 
and visitors. 

Question 13b. What other actions need to be taken to ensure accurate and timely 

tsunami predictions? 

Answer.  While  continued  investment  in  tsunami  warning  infrastructure,  such  as 
observing stations, will improve the accuracy and timeliness of tsunami predictions, 
there  must  be  an  investment  in  tsunami  research,  mitigation,  and  public  outreach 
and  education  efforts.  Maintaining  the  existing  U.S.  Tsunami  Warning  System  is 
critical.  NOAA  is  continuing  to  improve  and  upgrade  the  overall  Tsunami  Warning 
System.  This  is  achieved  through  improvements  to  Tsunami  Warning  Center  com-
puting capabilities, such as routine software upgrades and enhancements. Improve-
ments  to  forecasts  and  tsunami  products,  based  on  new  techniques,  research  and 
customer  demand,  are  also  part  of  a  continuous  process  to  improve  the  service 
NOAA’s  Tsunami  Warning  Centers  provide  to  the  Nation  every  day.  Collaborative 
research is needed to advance data collection, analysis, and assessment for tsunami 
tracking and numerical forecast modeling, as well as mitigation science. 

Question 13c. In your opinion, where are the most vulnerable gaps in our tsunami 

warning system? 

clude: 

Answer.  The  most  vulnerable  gaps  in  the  Nation’s  Tsunami  Warning  System  in-

1. Delivery of warning messages to those most at risk—Warning information can 
be effectively distributed through the NOAA/NWS infrastructure, but the infor-
mation  is  only  useful  when  people  have  the  capability  to  receive  it,  e.g.,  NOAA 
Weather  Radio  or  other  means.  We  are  working  to  strengthen  this  infrastruc-
ture and improve receipt of warning information. 
2. Improving hazard mitigation—While we have made progress in our modeling 
of  inundation  mapping  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  highest  risk  areas  in 
Washington,  Hawaii,  and  Puerto  Rico,  more  can  be  done  for  these  and  other 
areas.  Our  plans  include  continued  development  and  refinement  of  inundation 
maps  for  evacuation  routes,  land  use  planning,  and  educating  the  public  about 
their risk. 
3. Promoting mitigation activities for exposed communities and infrastructures— 
Working with our Federal, state and local partners, we will continue an aggres-
sive  outreach  and  education  program  to  ensure  the  public,  both  resident  and 
visitor, understand how to respond to tsunami information and can take appro-
priate action. 

Over  the  next  5  years,  NOAA  will  use  funding  from  the  2008  spectrum  sale,  as 
directed  by  the  Deficit  Reduction  Act  of  2005,  to  reduce  these  vulnerabilities  in  the 
Tsunami Warning System. 

Question 14. NOAA’s Office of Response and Restoration includes a Marine Debris 
removal  program,  with  a  proposed  budget  of  $4  million.  Funding  for  research  and 
cleanup  of  Marine  Debris  peaked  at  $4.9  million  in  FY  2005  and  has  remained  at 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

80 

lower  levels  since  then.  The  need  for  the  removal  of  marine  debris  is  an  ongoing 
issue  affecting  our  oceans  and  coastal  areas.  How  has  the  reduced  funding  levels 
affected  the  Office  of  Response  and  Restoration’s  ability  to  address  this  important 
issue? 

Answer.  The  President’s  Budget  request  for  $4  million  will  allow  the  NOAA  Ma-
rine  Debris  Program  to  address  the  most  pressing  issues  of  marine  debris  through 
several  different  avenues,  including  funding  assessment  and  research  projects,  re-
moval  projects,  and  outreach  and  education  activities.  All  of  these  are  done  in  con-
junction  with  other  organizations  and  research  facilities,  so  we  can  leverage  the 
amount  of  funding  received  from  Congress.  We  are  also  beginning  to  better  coordi-
nate Federal activities and needs to achieve more by capitalizing on each other’s ac-
tivities. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN F. KERRY TO 

VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C. LAUTENBACHER, JR. 

Question 1. Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary is one of the richest ma-
rine systems in the Nation. However, a 2007 status report evaluated the sanctuary’s 
health  based  on  17  key  indicators—most  received  marks  of  fair  or  poor.  We  need 
to be making the investments to protect these remarkable resources. At a time when 
there  is  increased  public  interest  in  and  support  for  marine  sanctuaries,  why  does 
the President’s budget call for a $2.5 million decrease to the Marine Sanctuary Pro-
gram base—reducing funding levels to $44.4 million? 

Answer.  The  FY  2009  President’s  budget  provides  $44.4  million  for  the  National 
Marine  Sanctuary  base.  These  funds  will  provide  resources  to  protect  our  invest-
ments  in  our  13  national  marine  sanctuaries—including  the  Gerry  E.  Studds 
Stellwagen  Bank  National  Marine  Sanctuary—and  the  Papaha¯naumokua¯kea  Ma-
rine  National  Monument.  NOAA  works  within  the  Administration’s  budget  process 
to  ensure  that  adequate  funds  are  requested  to  allow  the  National  Marine  Sanc-
tuary  Program  to  manage  these  sites  based  on  priority  needs  and  critical  core  re-
quirements. We remain deeply committed to protecting the special natural, historic, 
and cultural resources of these areas. 

Question  2.  Congress  appropriated  $235,000  in  FY08  for  the  deployment  of  a 
weather  buoy  in  Nantucket  Sound—this  is  critical  to  safe  navigation  and  weather 
forecasting. What is NOAA’s schedule for deployment of the buoy? 

Answer. The Nantucket Sound Weather Buoy is scheduled to be deployed in April 

2009. This schedule includes acquisition, fabrication, integration, and testing. 

Question  3.  I  understand  that  the  President’s  budget  will  add  back  two  sensors 
that  were  de-manifested  from  the  National  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environ-
mental  Satellite  System  (NPOESS)—the  CERES  (Clouds  and  the  Earth’s  Radiant 
Energy  System)  and  TSIS  (Total  Solar  Irradiance  Sensor).  What  is  your  long-term 
plan to ensure the continuity of essential climate observation data? 

Answer. The President’s FY 2009 Budget Request includes a $74 million initiative 
to  continue  the  restoration  of  climate  measurements  that  were  demanifested  from 
the  NPOESS  program  in  2006,  and  to  address  the  recommendation  of  the  National 
Academies  of  Sciences  Decadal  Survey  Report  to  restore  key  climate  and  environ-
mental sensors. 

NOAA  and  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  have  de-
termined  that  near-term  continuity  of  three  of  these  measurements  can  be  fulfilled 
through existing plans. Aerosol measurements can be fulfilled with the 2009 launch 
of the Aerosol Polarimeter Sensor on the NASA GLORY mission. Ozone vertical pro-
file data requirements were addressed by the NPOESS Executive Committee’s 2007 
decision  to  remanifest  the  Ozone  Mapper/Profiler  Suite-Limb  sensor  onto  the 
NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP). Continuity of RADAR altimetry measurements 
can  be  fulfilled  through  the  Jason  2  mission  that  was  launched  on  June  20,  2008. 
Continuity of the remaining two measurements—Earth radiation budget and total 
solar  irradiance—will  be  supported  by  the  $74  million  in  the  President’s  FY  2009 
Budget Request. Continuity of the Earth radiation budget data can be met with the 
Clouds  and  Earth  Radiant  Energy  System  (CERES)  sensor.  NOAA  and  NASA  will 
accelerate development of this instrument and will integrate it on the NPP mission 
which is scheduled for launch in June 2010. A replacement CERES instrument will 
be  developed  and  flown  on  the  first  NPOESS  satellite  (C–1)  when  it  is  launched  in 
2013.  Total  solar  irradiance  measurement  continuity  can  be  met  by  the  Total  Solar 
Irradiance  Sensor  (TSIS).  The  $74  million  in  the  FY  2009  President’s  Budget  re-
quest will allow this instrument to be developed and launched on the first NPOESS 
satellite (C–1) in 2013. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

81 

To  achieve  this  near-term  success,  these  instruments  must  be  delivered  in  time 
to  be  integrated  onto  the  NPP  and  NPOESS  C–1  spacecraft,  respectively,  to  meet 
scheduled launch dates. NOAA must receive full funding or authorization to expend 
funds at the $74 million level by October 1, 2008 to meet these schedules. Addition-
ally, full funding of the NPOESS-related budget requests of NOAA, NASA, and the 
Air  Force  is  also  required  to  ensure  that  the  climate  sensors  can  be  integrated  and 
launched on the NPP and NPOESS satellites to meet scheduled launch dates. 

Regarding long-term planning, NOAA and NASA, in collaboration with the Office 
of  Science  and  Technology  Policy  and  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  con-
tinue  to  work  with  the  climate  science  community  to  determine  when  additional 
sensors must be developed and launched to ensure uninterrupted continuity of these 
climate sensor measurements. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C. LAUTENBACHER, JR. 

Question  1.  S.  931,  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  Act  of  2007,  was 
introduced  in  March  2007  and  referred  to  the  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science, 
and  Transportation.  This  legislation  would  dramatically  expand  the  scope  of  basic 
research on hurricanes, including enhanced data collection, data analysis in critical 
research areas, and mechanisms to translate the results into improved forecasts and 
planning.  This  legislation  designates  NOAA  and  the  National  Science  Foundation 
(NSF)  as  lead  agencies  for  the  Initiative.  NOAA’s  various  line  offices  and  many 
other  Federal  agencies,  such  as  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey,  the  National  Aero-
nautics  and  Space  Administration,  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency 
(FEMA),  and  offices  within  the  Department  of  Defense  (e.g.,  Office  of  Naval  Re-
search)  have  existing  authorities  and  activities  that  are  closely  aligned  with  the 
goals  of  this  Initiative.  Is  NOAA  prepared  to  work  cooperatively  with  NSF  to  man-
age and implement this 10-year Initiative? 

Answer. NOAA is prepared to work cooperatively with NSF to manage and imple-
ment this 10 year initiative. NOAA has already engaged with NSF to formulate an 
agreement  aimed  at  cooperating  in  the  development  of  improved  hurricane  fore-
casting  and  to  ensure  expertise  and  facilities  of  academic  and  research  institutions 
and  other  nongovernmental  organizations  nationwide  are  leveraged  to  address  this 
national challenge. 

Question 2. How would this Initiative be coordinated with NOAA’s existing hurri-
cane  program  activities,  including  the  agency’s  Hurricane  Forecast  Improvement 
Project,  to  avoid  duplication  of  effort  and  address  the  highest-priority  needs  of  the 
primary consumers of the research results? 

Answer. NOAA established the national Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project 
(HFIP)  to  ensure  a  coordinated  NOAA  effort  for  improving  hurricane  forecasts  and 
ensure  the  efforts  meet  the  highest  priority  needs  of  NOAA  operational  elements. 
One  of  the  primary  objectives  of  HFIP  is  to  accelerate  and  transition  proven  re-
search  results  into  operations.  The  HFIP  manager  reports  directly  to  the  Assistant 
Administrator  for  Weather  Services  and  the  Assistant  Administrator  for  Oceanic 
and  Atmospheric  Research.  This  project  is  overseen  by  an  Executive  Oversight 
Board  consisting  of  key  NOAA  Hurricane  Program  operational  managers.  Any 
NOAA  hurricane  research  activities  arising  from  the  National  Hurricane  Research 
Initiative, including the application and transition of the broader initiative research 
results  to  NOAA  operations,  would  be  managed  through  the  NOAA  HFIP,  with  re-
view  by  its  Executive  Oversight  Board  and  the  responsible  Assistant  Administra-
tors. The draft plan for HFIP was published in the Federal Register for public com-
ment, and the comments we received supported the plan. 

Question  3.  Academic  and  research  institutions  and  other  nongovernmental  orga-
nizations  nationwide  possess  expertise  and  facilities  that  are  well  suited  to  under-
take much of the research that would be conducted under this Initiative. How would 
NOAA, in coordination with NSF, maximize the effective utilization of these consid-
erable  non-Federal  assets  in  conducting  the  Initiative’s  fundamental  research  and 
in developing and disseminating related products? 

Answer. NOAA is currently engaging with the other key Federal agencies, includ-
ing NSF, NASA, and the Navy (including Office of Naval Research) to develop a Na-
tional Hurricane Research Alliance. This Alliance will leverage existing Federal hur-
ricane  coordination  efforts,  including  those  from  the  Office  of  the  Federal  Coordi-
nator  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Supporting  Research,  to  manage  overall  roles 
and  responsibilities  (including  those  of  the  broader  academic  community  funded  by 
NSF, NOAA, and others). Through this Alliance, NOAA and NSF will work with the 
other  entities  to  maximize  the  effective  use  of  considerable  non-Federal  assets  in 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

conducting  the  Initiative’s  fundamental  research,  and  in  developing  and  dissemi-
nating related products and services. 

82 

Question  4.  The  National  Earthquake  Hazards  Reduction  Program  (NEHRP), 
which  was  created  in  1977,  has  research  goals,  program  partners,  and  products 
similar  to  those  proposed  for  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative.  In 
NEHRP’s 2004 reauthorization (P.L. 108–360), Congress reorganized the program in 
several  ways.  Changes  included  shifting  lead-agency  responsibilities  from  FEMA  to 
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  and  creating  an  advi-
sory  committee  composed  of  non-Federal  experts  to  provide  guidance  to  the  lead 
agency and the program’s Interagency Coordinating Committee. 

Would  NOAA  view  a  similar  structure—specifically,  collaboration  between  a  lead 
Federal agency, an interagency working group, and an expert advisory committee— 
as being beneficial in implementing the National Hurricane Research Initiative and 
in  periodically  examining  its  progress  and  aiding  in  the  review  and  revision  of  pro-
gram goals as needed? 

Answer. NOAA does view a similar structure as being beneficial in implementing 
the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative  but  points  out  that  a  similar  structure 
is already in place. As stated in the previous response, NOAA is currently engaging 
with  other  key  Federal  agencies  through  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Alliance 
and  the  Office  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Sup-
porting Research. NOAA’s existing Science Advisory Board would be an effective ex-
pert  advisory  committee  to  periodically  examine  scientific  progress  and  aid  in  re-
view. 

Question  5.  Does  NOAA  have  any  other  interagency  or  intergovernmental  (i.e., 
Federal/state/local)  partnerships  through  its  hurricane  research  program,  forecast 
operations,  community  resiliency  initiative,  or  other  related  programs  that  should 
be considered as Congress considers this National Hurricane Research Initiative? 

Answer.  The  Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Supporting  Re-
search  (OFCM)  coordinates  Federal  Hurricane  Operations  and  Research  efforts 
across  the  responsible  Federal  agencies.  Efforts  from  the  OFCM  should  be  consid-
ered  by  Congress  as  it  considers  the  National  Hurricane  Research  Initiative.  We 
suggest hurricane related research efforts from the National Ocean Partnership Pro-
gram  and  the  U.S.  Weather  Research  Program  also  be  considered  by  Congress  to 
further the overall hurricane research effort. 

Question  6.  In  addition  to  reauthorizing  and  restructuring  NEHRP,  P.L.  108–360 
established  the  National  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Program  (NWIRP)  in  2004. 
The  program’s  primary  goals  are  to  improve  meteorological  understanding  of  wind-
storms,  quantify  windstorm  impacts,  and  identify  and  promote  cost-effective  meas-
ures to reduce windstorm impacts. 

Please summarize briefly what progress NOAA has made in addressing the goals 
of NWIRP with the funds appropriated by Congress from FY 2005 through FY 2008. 
In  particular,  please  explain  how  NOAA  intends  to  spend  the  approximately 
$700,000  that  was  appropriated  by  Congress  for  FY2008.  What  additional  accom-
plishments related to NWIRP’s goals has NOAA made through other authorized pro-
gram activities? 

Answer.  The  Act  stipulates  that  ‘‘NOAA  shall  support  atmospheric  sciences  re-
search to improve the understanding of the behavior of windstorms and their impact 
on buildings, structures, and lifelines.’’ In line with the Act, NOAA spends $700,000 
per year on activities that improve the understanding of the behavior of windstorms 
and  their  impacts.  This  includes  the  continuing  development  and  use  of  the 
H*WIND (hurricane wind analysis) product at the Hurricane Research Division, the 
National  Severe  Storm  Laboratory’s  outreach  on  structural  wind  hazards,  and  Sea 
Grant’s  funding  of  an  instrumented  house  in  coastal  North  Carolina  and  cor-
responding education and outreach through its extension service. 

In  response  to  the  legislation  and  to  a  bilateral  plan  with  the  National  Institute 
of  Science  and  Technology  (NIST),  NOAA  has  a  $300,000  increase  in  the  FY  2009 
Hurricane  Forecast  Improvement  Project  initiative  to  deploy  high  time  and  spatial 
resolution wind measurements along the coast for use by structural engineers. 

In  general,  NOAA  supports  a  number  of  activities  related  to  measuring  and  pre-

dicting windstorms and their impact such as: 

• The  National  Weather  Radar  Testbed  is  studying  how  Multifunction  Phased 
Array Radar (MPAR), with its advanced capabilities and performance can meet 
the  Nation’s  weather,  aviation,  and  homeland  security  needs.  NOAA  scientists 
recently  proved  MPAR  can  detect  rotation,  hail,  microbursts  and  gust  fronts 
well ahead of other radars due to its rapid scan capability.

• NOAA researchers co-sponsored the annual NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed 
with forecasters from the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center to 
focus on early and precise warnings of severe weather hazards. The Hazardous 
Weather  Testbed  also  emphasizes  developing,  testing  and  evaluating  forecasts 
that could predict severe weather a week in advance. 

Question 7. In April 2006, the National Science and Technology Council published 
the  ‘‘Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Implementation  Plan,’’  as  required  by  P.L.  108– 
360.  NOAA  was  one  of  several  Federal  agencies  involved  in  the  formulation  of  this 
plan. 

Since  the  implementation  plan  was  completed,  how  has  NOAA  been  engaged  by 
the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and/or the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) concerning NWIRP? Beginning with FY 2005, has OSTP or OMB 
ever  provided  NOAA  with  any  guidance  concerning  NWIRP  during  formulation  of 
NOAA’s  annual  budget  request?  In  turn,  has  NOAA  sought  assistance  from  OSTP 
in preparing budget requests or spending plans for NWIRP-related activities? To the 
best  of  your  knowledge,  is  the  level  of  interaction  or  guidance  that  NOAA  has  re-
ceived from OSTP typical of that provided to the other agencies participating in this 
program? 

Answer.  In  response  to  the  NWIRP  legislation,  OSTP  formed  a  Working  Group 
on Wind Hazard Reduction under its Subcommittee for Disaster Reduction in 2005. 
Each agency mentioned in the legislation plus the Federal Highway Administration 
is represented on this Working Group. 

NOAA chaired the Working Group for the first 2 years during which time an im-
plementation  plan  and  a  biannual  progress  report  was  completed.  These  were  done 
under  the  guidance  of  the  OSTP.  OSTP  has  discussed  the  way  forward  with  the 
NWIRP  agencies,  but  no  additional  actions  have  been  taken  under  NWIRP.  The 
OSTP guidance has been provided at the Working Group meetings to all agency rep-
resentatives  equally,  and  the  agency  representatives  have  had  the  opportunity  to 
provide their ideas about ways forward. 

NOAA  has  not  asked  for  assistance  from  OSTP  on  budget  requests  or  spending 

plans for NWIRP-related activities. OSTP has left these matters to the agencies. 

Question  8.  From  FY  2005  through  FY  2008,  NOAA  was  authorized  to  be  appro-
priated  $2  million  per  year  under  NWIRP.  Is  funding  of  $2  million  per  year  ade-
quate  for  NOAA  to  partner  fully  with  the  other  NWIRP  agencies  and  accomplish 
the research and operations-related goals described in the NWIRP-authorizing stat-
ute and in the April 2006 implementation plan? 

Answer. NOAA supports the President’s FY 2009 budget request of $1 million for 
activities  within  NOAA  related  to  the  National  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Act. 
This funding will allow NOAA to develop new strategies and technologies for observ-
ing storms, to improve our models for predicting storm intensity, and to provide crit-
ical assistance to forecasters. 

Additionally,  the  President’s  2009  Budget,  not  including  the  recently  transmitted 
budget  amendment,  provides  nearly  $20  million  for  hurricane-related  increases 
across  NOAA,  including  modeling  improvements  on  forecasts  and  storm  surge  and 
research into ocean vector winds and coastal inundation. 

NOAA has a diverse mission ranging from managing fisheries to predicting severe 
weather.  The  Administration’s  request  provides  a  balanced  set  of  priorities  to  sus-
tain  core  mission  services  and  address  our  highest  priority  program  needs.  NOAA 
will  continue  to  work  within  the  Administration  and  with  Congress  to  ensure  that 
our program needs are addressed. 

Question  9.  Harmful  algal  blooms  (HABs)  and  hypoxia  events  have  far-reaching 
consequences  for  coastal  communities,  including  human  health  impacts,  harm  to 
wildlife  and  ecosystems,  and  economic  losses  from  lost  tourism.  Congress  is  cur-
rently  considering  legislation  that  would  reauthorize  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and 
Hypoxia Research and Control Act (HABHRCA), which was first passed in 1998 and 
last amended in 2004. NOAA has several programs that support research and other 
activities  concerning  HABs  (e.g.,  ECOHAB,  MERHAB,  RDDT)  and  hypoxia  (e.g., 
CHRP, NGOMEX). 

For FY 2009, the Administration has only requested $10.8 million for HABHRCA- 
related  programs.  While  this  represents  an  increase  of  $2  million  over  what  Con-
gress appropriated in FY 2008, it is still far below historical levels ($12.7–20.2 mil-
lion) and far below the $25.5 million that is currently authorized. 

Does  the  Administration  view  the  funding  requested  for  FY2009  as  adequate  to 
address  the  myriad  research,  forecasting,  monitoring,  prevention,  and  response 
needs that exist among the state, regional, and local authorities nationwide that are 
dealing with HABs and hypoxia events and their impacts?

Answer.  The  President’s  FY  2009  Budget  Request  includes  $15.8  million  for  the 
National  Centers  for  Coastal  Ocean  Science  (NCCOS)  Competitive  Research  line, 
which  supports  a  suite  of  competitive  grant  programs  including  Harmful  Algal 
Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Research  and  Control  Act  programs.  If  appropriated  at  $15.8 
million  for  the  Competitive  Research  line,  NCCOS  will  use  at  least  $8.9  million  for 
research related to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. Over the past few years this 
effort  has  been  appropriated  below  the  President’s  request.  This  has  reduced  the 
scope of activities and delayed progress of NOAA efforts toward mitigating HAB and 
hypoxia impacts to coastal ecosystems and communities. 

Question  10.  There  are  a  number  of  reports  required  by  HABHRCA  that  NOAA 
is  yet  to  complete  and  furnish  to  Congress.  Please  report  on  NOAA’s  progress  in 
completing these overdue reports, including a timeline for final submission. 

Answer.  On  December  10,  2004  the  President  signed  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom 
and  Hypoxia  Amendments  Act  of  2004  (HABHRCA)  which  calls  on  NOAA  to  ad-
vance  the  scientific  understanding  of,  and  ability  to  detect,  monitor,  assess,  predict 
and  mitigate,  harmful  algal  blooms  (HABs)  and  hypoxia  (low  oxygen  conditions). 
HABHRCA  called  for  5  written  reports  to  assess  the  current  state  of  research  on 
and response to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The Interagency Working Group 
on  Harmful  Algal  Blooms,  Hypoxia,  and  Human  Health  (IWG–4H),  co-chaired  by 
NOAA  and  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  was  tasked  with  draft-
ing the reports. The IWG–4H has been working to ensure these reports include the 
most  up  to  date  information  and  are  of  the  highest  quality,  which  has  taken  some 
time. The status of the reports is as follows: 

» The  National  Assessment  of  Efforts  to  Predict  and  Respond  to  Harmful  Algal 

Blooms in U.S. Waters, was published in September 2007; 

» The  National  Scientific  Research,  Development,  Demonstration,  and  Tech-
nology  Transfer  Plan  on  Reducing  Impacts  from  Harmful  Algal  Blooms 
(RDDTT  Plan)  and  The  Scientific  Assessment  of  Marine  Harmful  Algal 
Blooms are undergoing interagency review; 

» The Scientific Assessment of Freshwater Harmful Algal Blooms has been com-

pleted and approved and will be published online soon; and 

» The Scientific Assessments of Hypoxia is currently being drafted by the Inter-

agency Working Group. 

Question  11.  Significant  hypoxia  events  have  become  more  numerous  in  coastal 
waters  around  the  U.S.,  including  in  the  Great  Lakes  and  along  the  Pacific  North-
west.  At  this  time,  scientists  or  research  entities  interested  in  pursuing  grants  for 
hypoxia-related  work,  particularly  outside  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  have  far  fewer  op-
portunities to compete for funding as compared to their HABs counterparts. 

Since  HABHRCA’s  enactment,  has  NOAA  received  requests  for  assistance  to  un-
dertake  hypoxia-related  research,  forecasting,  monitoring,  prevention,  or  mitigation 
activities  from  areas  outside  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico?  If  so,  what  geographic  regions 
were  covered  by  these  requests,  and  what  was  the  cumulative  cost  (approximately) 
of the requested assistance? How much has NOAA spent (approximately) in the last 
5 years internally and extramurally on hypoxia-related research in the Gulf of Mex-
ico? In areas outside of the Gulf of Mexico? 

Answer.  Through  the  NOAA  Coastal  Hypoxia  Research  Program  (CHRP),  initi-
ated  in  FY  2004  with  competitions  held  in  FY  2005  and  FY  2007,  NOAA  has  re-
ceived  requests  for  assistance  to  undertake  hypoxia-related  research,  forecasting, 
monitoring,  prevention,  or  mitigation  activities  from  many  regions  outside  of  the 
Gulf  of  Mexico,  a  testament  to  the  national  scale  of  the  problem.  These  requests 
have  been  binned  into  the  following  regions  with  a  corresponding  cumulative  cost 
of the requested assistance:

Question  12.  The  availability  of  funding  notwithstanding,  do  you  have  any  rec-
ommendations on how to achieve greater equity in terms of opportunities for eligible 
entities to compete for funding for hypoxia-related activities? Has NOAA considered 
building on NGOMEX and CHRP to create broader (i.e., national) hypoxia programs 
that are parallel in scope to ECOHAB and MERHAB? 

Answer. The recently reauthorized HABHRCA and the report required by this leg-
islation  provide  guidance  for  ongoing  and  future  NOAA  research  efforts  related  to 
hypoxia.  NOAA  has  maintained  a  long-term  research  program  investigating  the 
causes,  consequences  and  prediction  of  the  seasonal  hypoxic  (or  ‘‘dead’’)  zone  in  the 
northern Gulf of Mexico, the largest zone of its type in North America. These efforts, 
funded  through  the  northern  Gulf  of  Mexico  Research  Program  (NGOMEX),  have 
provided  the  scientific  basis  for  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  Action  Plan  required  by 
HABHRCA.  NGOMEX  funds  interdisciplinary  research  projects  to  develop  a  funda-
mental understanding of the northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystem with a focus on the 
causes  and  effects  of  the  hypoxic  zone  and  the  prediction  of  its  future  extent  and 
impacts. The research program is directed toward the goal of developing a predictive 
capability  and  an  adaptive  management  framework  for  hypoxia  in  the  Louisiana 
continental  shelf  ecosystem.  Given  the  scale  and  impact  of  the  problem  in  the  Gulf 
of  Mexico,  with  nutrient  management  implications  for  roughly  40  percent  of  the 
United States, NOAA continues to support the NGOMEX program and its participa-
tion  in  the  Mississippi  River/Gulf  of  Mexico  Watershed  Task  Force.  Complimentary 
to NGOMEX is the Coastal Hypoxia Research Program (CHRP), the intent of which 
is to expand NOAA’s research capability to address hypoxia in other regions outside 
of the Gulf of Mexico experiencing hypoxia. The objective of CHRP is to provide re-
search  results  and  modeling  tools  that  will  be  used  by  coastal  resource  managers 
to  assess  alternative  management  strategies  for  preventing  or  mitigating  the  im-
pacts  of  hypoxia  on  coastal  ecosystems.  Determining  the  causes  of  hypoxia,  devel-
oping the capability to predict its occurrence in response to varying levels of anthro-
pogenic  stress,  and  evaluating  the  subsequent  ecological,  economic,  and  social  im-

pacts  are  necessary  to  assess  potential  management  alternatives.  Therefore,  be-
tween  the  two  programs  (NGOMEX  and  CHRP),  researchers  and  managers  from 
anywhere  in  U.S.  have  an  opportunity  to  compete  for  hypoxia  research  support. 
More information about both programs is available at the following websites:

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO 

VICE ADMIRAL CONRAD C. LAUTENBACHER, JR. 

Question  1a.  The  Administration  has  requested  approximately  $4.1  billion  for 
NOAA in its 2009 proposal—a 5.2 percent increase from the level enacted in Fiscal 
Year  2008.  This  Administration’s  request  exceeds  funding  previously  provided  by 
Congress, which would appear to suggest that the President is placing a greater pri-
ority  on  funding  our  critical  ocean  and  atmospheric  science  and  management  pro-
grams.  However,  upon  closer  examination,  it  is  clear  that  this  increase  in  funding 
is  entirely  devoted  to  a  single  satellite  program,  and  that  most  other  programs— 
including all ocean and coastal programs—are facing notable cuts. 

Satellites  are  expensive  and  warrant  a  $200  million  request,  but  is  it  fair  to  say 
that  this  increase  is  being  paid  for  by  requesting  cuts  for  most  other  programs— 
most notably all oceans and coastal programs? If not, is NOAA suggesting that Con-
gress has been over-funding the ocean and coastal programs? 

Answer.  NOAA  has  a  diverse  mission  ranging  from  managing  fisheries  to  pre-
dicting severe weather. The Administration’s request provides a balanced set of pri-
orities  to  sustain  core  mission  services  and  address  our  highest  priority  program 
needs.  Even  within  a  restrained  fiscal  environment,  however,  the  President’s  FY 
2009  Budget  Request  includes  over  $1.9  billion  in  ocean  and  coastal  program  fund-
ing, including $49 million in increases in support of the President’s Ocean Initiative. 
NOAA will continue to work within the Administration and with Congress to ensure 
the needs of ocean, coastal and fisheries program are addressed. 

Question  1b.  What  Congressional  directives  would  not  be  carried  out  if  these 

ocean and coastal cuts are maintained in the 2009 budget? 

Answer. NOAA removes unrequested Congressional directives and add-ons during 
our annual planning process to prepare the President’s Budget Request, and before 
addressing  NOAA’s  priorities  within  the  new  budget.  The  determination  of  NOAA 
priorities  within  the  President’s  Budget  Request  is  shaped  by  both  the  Administra-
tion’s  priorities  and  NOAA’s  programmatic  needs.  Each  fiscal  year,  NOAA  under-
goes  an  extensive  review  of  current  and  future  projects,  allowing  for  a  continuous 
reevaluation of priorities and funding. The top priorities that emerge come from in-
tegrated requirements-based planning linked to NOAA’s strategic vision and the op-
timization  of  our  capabilities.  Within  the  constraints  of  the  current  fiscal  environ-
ment, NOAA proposes funding its highest priority programs. 

Question  2.  Last  October,  NMFS  issued  regulations  on  the  lobster  industry  in-
tended  to  protect  endangered  whales.  These  rules  would  require  lobstermen  to  use 
sinking  rope  to  connect  their  strings  of  pots,  something  made  nearly  impossible  in 
many  areas  off  the  coast  of  Maine  by  rocky  bottom  conditions  and  strong  tides. 
NMFS  suggested  that  these  regulations  would  impose  total  costs  of  approximately 
$14  million,  over  ninety  percent  of  which  would  be  borne  by  the  lobster  industry. 
The  Maine  Lobstermen’s  Association  puts  that  figure  at  $10–15,000  in  first  year 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

costs alone per lobsterman, and annual replacement costs of up to $9,000, far in ex-
cess  of  your  agency’s  estimates.  In  July  2007,  a  GAO  analysis  of  the  then  proposed 
rules found that NMFS: 

• ‘‘did not adequately represent uncertainties associated with proposed gear modi-
fications  cost,  and  could  not  fully  assess  impacts  on  fishing  communities.’’  and 
• ‘‘cannot  estimate  the  extent  to  which  risks  to  whales  will  be  reduced’’  by  these 

regulations. 

In  other  words,  it  appears  that  your  agency  conducted  an  inadequate  economic 
analysis  and  then  imposed  on  the  lobster  industry  a  set  of  regulations  that  have 
an unproven likelihood of success. 

Answer.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  believes  the  economic  analysis  presented  in  the 
Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (DEIS)  used  to  determine  the  costs  of  the 
then  proposed  fishing  gear  modifications  was  adequate.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service 
noted  that  GAO’s  review  of  the  DEIS  economic  analysis  recommended  no  changes 
to the models or methods employed. GAO’s principal finding with respect to the eco-
nomic  analysis  was  to  recommend  that  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  improve  the  rep-
resentation  of  uncertainties  in  the  analysis  by  presenting  a  range  of  possible  costs 
in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). 

In response to this recommendation, the FEIS includes a quantitative assessment 
of  the  sensitivity  of  compliance  cost  estimates  to  variations  in  four  factors:  (1)  the 
increase  in  gear  loss  that  lobster  trap/pot  vessels  fishing  in  Maine  inshore  waters 
may  experience  as  a  result  of  converting  from  floating  groundline  to  sinking  and/ 
or  neutrally  buoyant  groundline;  (2)  the  rate  at  which  sinking  and/or  neutrally 
buoyant  groundline  will  wear  out  and  need  to  be  replaced;  (3)  the  price  of  sinking 
and/or  neutrally  buoyant  line  relative  to  the  price  of  floating  line;  and  (4)  the  esti-
mated  number  of  state-permitted  vessels  subject  to  the  Atlantic  Large  Whale  Take 
Reduction  Plan  requirements.  The  FEIS  presents  this  analysis,  providing  cost  esti-
mates  for  each  regulatory  option  under  a  range  of  alternative  assumptions.  NOAA 
Fisheries Service believes that incorporation of this analysis into the FEIS fully ad-
dresses  GAO’s  recommendations  for  improvement  of  the  economic  analysis  pre-
sented in the DEIS. 

Some  industry  organization’s  cost  analyses  include  alternative  assumptions  that 
increase each of the cost parameters to reflect extreme predictions of gear costs and 
functionality.  Although  the  industry  organization’s  have  an  intimate  knowledge  of 
the  lobster  fishery,  their  statements  are  based  upon  the  predictions  of  individuals 
with  limited  or  no  experience  fishing  with  sinking  groundline.  In  contrast,  NOAA 
Fisheries  Service  gear  experts  developed  the  assumptions  applied  in  the  economic 
analysis based upon detailed conversations with individuals throughout the Atlantic 
coast  with  years  of  experience  fishing  sinking  groundline  in  a  variety  of  habitats, 
including  Maine’s  rocky  bottom.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  would  also  like  to  specify 
some additional points related to these comments: 

• The average cost of groundline was estimated based upon estimates for specific 
products.  The  estimate  the  commenter  uses  for  certain  brands  is  significantly 
higher than the price at which the brand is sold by gear suppliers. 
• The  commenter’s  assumptions  about  the  useful  life  of  sinking  groundline  are 
based upon field studies with experimental gear, instead of commercially avail-
able sinking groundline used in NOAA Fisheries Service assumptions. 
• Based  upon  discussions  that  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  gear  experts  had  with 
fishermen  operating  with  sinking  groundline  in  hard  bottom  environments,  the 
rate of gear loss would be significantly less than the rate suggested by the com-
menter. 
• Evidence  from  Vessel  Trip  Report  data  indicates  that  a  significant  number  of 
Federal  permit  holders  that  the  commenter  assumes  would  be  affected  by  the 
rule do not actively fish and would therefore not incur costs of gear conversion. 
Question 2a. Do you find it acceptable that a single industry is saddled with such 
major  economic  impact  for  regulations  that  are  not  even  likely  to  achieve  their  in-
tended goal? 

Answer.  Based  on  comments  received  on  the  Draft  Environmental  Impact  State-
ment (DEIS), NOAA Fisheries Service developed a new preferred alternative in the 
Final EIS (FEIS) that offered significantly lower economic costs while sacrificing lit-
tle protectiveness. Chapter 8 of the FEIS provides an overview of the costs and ben-
efits  of  all  the  alternatives.  Because  of  the  geographic  concentration  of  the  lobster 
fishery  in  New  England  (see  FEIS  Chapter  7)  and  the  relatively  large  size  of  the 
lobster fishery, it is true that New England vessels bear a large share of the overall 
estimated  costs  of  the  Atlantic  Large  Whale  Take  Reduction  Plan  modifications.

88 

Given whale movements and behavior, however, New England waters represent im-
portant areas for entanglement risk reduction. Furthermore, the social impact anal-
ysis  suggests  that  only  a  limited  subset  of  smaller  vessels  are  likely  to  experience 
costs  that  represent  a  significant  share  of  per-vessel  fishing  revenues.  Groundline 
buyback programs will help mitigate compliance cost impacts. 

NOAA  Fisheries  Service  firmly  believes  that  the  recent  amendment  to  the  Take 
Reduction  Plan  will  achieve  its  intended  goals.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  believes 
that  the  final  rule  published  in  October  2007  represents  a  comprehensive  suite  of 
amendments to the Take Reduction Plan. NOAA Fisheries Service worked with the 
Atlantic  Large  Whale  Take  Reduction  Team  to  help  evaluate  the  Take  Reduction 
Plan and discuss additional modifications necessary to meet the goals of the Marine 
Mammal  Protection  Act  and  the  Endangered  Species  Act.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service 
also  solicited  input  from  the  public  after  issuing  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  prepare  an 
EIS.  Although  there  were  no  consensus  recommendations  from  the  Take  Reduction 
Team or consistent proposals from the public, NOAA Fisheries Service believes that 
it  has  developed  the  best  options  available  for  amending  the  Take  Reduction  Plan. 
Question  2b.  Do  you  agree  that  the  general  public,  which  receives  the  benefit  of 
that  protection,  bear  some  of  the  cost?  If  so,  what  programs  do  you  intend  to  fund 
within  the  parameters  of  this  budget  request  that  will  help  defray  the  burdensome 
cost to the affected fishing industries? 

Answer. We agree that the general public, which receives the benefit of that pro-
tection,  should  bear  some  of  the  cost.  While  the  FY  2009  budget  does  not  request 
additional  funding  for  lobster  gear  buyback  and  recycling  programs,  NOAA  Fish-
eries  Service  has  worked  with  the  fishing  industry  and  conservation  organizations 
such as the Gulf of Maine Lobster Foundation, the National Fish and Wildlife Foun-
dation  and  the  International  Fund  for  Animal  Welfare  to  promote  these  activities. 
As a result of these gear buyback efforts, approximately 4,700 miles of floating line 
have been removed from the ocean providing a valuable entanglement risk reduction 
for large whales. 

Question  3.  Following  a  field  hearing  on  this  topic  in  Maine  this  past  February, 
lobster  fishermen  have  been  meeting  with  representatives  from  environmental 
groups to attempt to come to some consensus about a way forward on this issue that 
will  increase  benefits  to  whales  but  reduce  the  impacts  on  the  lobster  industry. 
These may include permission to use neutrally buoyant rope in certain areas in ex-
change  for  a  reduction  in  endlines—the  ropes  that  run  from  the  buoy  to  the  traps 
on the seabed. This proposal would almost certainly result in less rope in the water, 
and  greater  protection  for  whales  and  reduce  costs  and  increase  safety  for  our 
lobstermen. 

If these groups come to a mutually acceptable, scientifically supported agreement, 
how could the regulations be changed to reflect that proposal? Is it feasible for these 
changes to be in place before the scheduled implementation date of October 5, 2008? 
If not, could that date be pushed back to coincide with the start of the next fishing 
year? 

Answer. Should this group develop a mutually acceptable, scientifically supported 
alternative  to  the  sinking  groundline  requirement,  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  would 
forward their proposal to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team for consid-
eration. If the proposal received a favorable review from the Take Reduction Team, 
NOAA Fisheries Service would develop and publish a proposed rule and supporting 
environmental  analysis.  The  proposed  rule  and  ultimately,  the  final  rule,  would  go 
through  the  normal  rulemaking  process  as  required  by  the  Administrative  Proce-
dures  Act  and  other  applicable  mandates  and  statutes.  Based  on  the  various  man-
dates and statutory requirements, it would not be feasible to develop and implement 
changes  to  the  sinking  groundline  provision  prior  to  the  scheduled  October  5,  2008 
implementation date. 

However,  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  has  recently  published  a  proposed  rule  to 
amend the regulations implementing the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan 
to  provide  an  additional  6  months  (through  April  5,  2009)  for  trap/pot  fishermen 
along  the  Atlantic  East  Coast  to  comply  with  the  broad-based  sinking  groundline 
requirement.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  will  evaluate  the  comments  received  on  the 
proposed  rule  prior  to  making  its  final  determination  regarding  the  6-month  exten-
sion. 

Question  4.  While  many  fishermen  continue  to  do  their  part  to  minimize  right 
whale entanglements, and others are being forced to bear the burden of undue and 
unproven regulatory restrictions, many are troubled by the fact that there seems to 
be  little  progress  in  reducing  right  whale  deaths  due  to  ship  strikes.  In  fact,  ship 
strikes have killed three times as many north Atlantic right whales since 2001 than 
gear entanglements. In February 2007, NOAA sent a final rule to the Office of Man-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

89 

agement  and  Budget  that  would  reduce  the  likelihood  of  ship  strikes  by  instituting 
speed  limits  in  certain  areas  along  the  eastern  seaboard  at  times  when  whales  are 
present. Today, more than a year later, that rule stills sits with OMB. 

Given  that  it  has  been  over  a  year  since  the  final  rule  was  submitted  to  OMB, 
when  can  we  expect  to  see  action  taken  on  it?  Do  you  agree  that  your  agency  has 
failed  to  protect  whales  from  ship  strikes  as  it  is  required  to  do  under  the  Marine 
Mammal  Protection  Act?  Assuming  this  failure  is  unacceptable  to  you,  how  do  you 
intend to rectify the situation? 

Answer.  NOAA  has  taken  and  continues  to  take  a  comprehensive  approach  to 
minimizing  the  risk  of  ship  strikes  and  other  threats  to  whales.  Since  NOAA  pub-
lished  an  Advanced  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  on  the  ship  strike  rule  in  2004 
and  a  proposed  rule  in  2006,  NOAA  has,  with  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  through 
the International Maritime Organization, shifted ship traffic lanes to reduce the risk 
of  collisions  between  large  ships  and  whales  into  and  out  of  Boston  Harbor.  The 
shift in Boston ship traffic added only 3.75 nautical miles (roughly 10 to 22 minutes 
to  one-way  trips  depending  upon  the  type  of  vessel  and  the  speed  at  which  they 
travel), yet would potentially reduce the risk of ship strikes to right whales by mov-
ing ships out of known right whale habitat. 

Also,  in  collaboration  with  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  with  the  support  of  the 
International  Maritime  Organization,  NOAA  established  and  continues  to  maintain 
two  Mandatory  Ship  Reporting  systems—one  in  waters  off  New  England  and  an-
other in calving/nursery areas in waters off Georgia and Florida. The systems, oper-
ational  since  July  1999,  require  that  all  ships  300  gross  tons  and  greater  report  to 
a  shore-based  station  via  satellite  communication  systems  upon  entering  these  two 
key  right  whale  aggregation  areas.  Mariners  are  required  to  report  ship  name,  call 
sign,  entry  location,  destination,  and  ship  speed.  The  reports  prompt  an  automated 
return message providing information about the vulnerability of right whales to ship 
strikes, and recent right whale sighting locations. 

In  2006,  NOAA  established  recommended  shipping  routes  in  key  right  whale  ag-
gregation  areas  within  Cape  Cod  Bay  and  off  three  ports  in  Georgia  and  Florida. 
The routes are an attempt to reduce the co-occurrence of whales and ships by mini-
mizing  ship  transit  times  in  whale  habitat  and  avoiding  specific  whale  aggregation 
areas,  while  also  ensuring  navigational  safety  and  limiting  adverse  effects  on  the 
shipping industry. 

NOAA  has  also  worked  with  its  partners  in  developing,  publishing,  and  distrib-
uting  guidelines  for  mariners  when  operating  in  right  whale  habitat.  NOAA  and 
other  Federal  and  state  agencies  support  or  conduct  extensive  aircraft  surveys  for 
right  whales.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  assembles  reports  and  right  whale  ‘‘alerts’’ 
are disseminated to mariners via multiple media. 

Additionally,  through  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  other  broadcasts,  NOAA  provides 
vessel  speed  advisories  in  areas  where  right  whales  occur.  Education  and  outreach 
remain  an  important  part  of  NOAA’s  overall  strategy  for  reducing  threats  to  right 
whales  and  other  whales  from  ship  strikes.  For  example,  in  June  2007,  NOAA  and 
the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  released  ‘‘A  Prudent  Mariner’s  Guide  to  Right  Whale  Protec-
tion.’’  This  interactive,  multi-media  CD  program  is  distributed  free-of-charge  upon 
request  and  contains  crew  training  information  about  right  whales,  recommended 
navigation  actions  when  operating  in  right  whale  habitat,  guidance  for  compliance 
with the Mandatory Ship Reporting System, and what to do in the event an injured 
right whale is sighted. 

Question 5a. NOAA requires basic oceanographic data to improve climate and re-
source  management  models  and  create  more  accurate  weather  and  sea  state  fore-
casts.  I  appreciate  your  request  of  $6.5  million  for  implementation  of  NOAA’s  Inte-
grated  Ocean  Observing  System,  and  $14.5  million  for  regional  observations.  These 
are increases from last year’s request, but still below the $26.3 million Congress en-
acted in FY08 for ocean and coastal observations. And your request is still far below 
the  number  recommended  by  the  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy:  $138  million 
to initiate an IOOS system, and escalated that figure to half a billion dollars within 
5 years. While we can argue about actual numbers, investment on this scale is war-
ranted, as forecasts based on data from an ocean observing system in the south Pa-
cific is estimated by NOAA to have generated returns in excess of one billion dollars 
annually.  Given  these  potential  economic  benefits,  why  have  you  requested  such  a 
relatively modest amount to ocean observing systems this year? 

Answer.  The  FY  2009  President’s  Budget  Request  is  $21  million  for  NOAA  Inte-
grated  Ocean  Observing  System  (IOOS)  activities.  This  is  $7  million  above  the  FY 
2008  request  or  nearly  50  percent  more  than  included  in  last  year’s  request;  this 
increase  demonstrates  a  continuing  commitment  to  the  IOOS  program.  Within  the 
context  of  NOAA’s  overall  budget,  any  new  investment  area  is  funded  at  the  ex-
pense  of  other  important  NOAA  programs.  Modest,  incremental  budget  increases

can be expected for new programs as they work toward demonstrated and validated 
program results. 

Center (NDBC) in Stennis, Mississippi ($1 million); and 

The requested increase of $7 million will: 
• Support a national technical capability within NOAA ($3.0 million); 
• Improve capacity for the Data Assembly Center at NOAA’s National Data Buoy 
• Provide additional support for the regional component of IOOS ($3 million). 
Within the $21 million total, $14.5 million is requested for ‘‘IOOS Regional Obser-
vations’’. This funding will allow NOAA to continue its competitive selection process 
for grants and cooperative agreements, to establish a regional network of observing 
systems  to  serve  both  national  and  regional  needs  for  ocean  observing  data  and  in-
formation services. 

The remaining $6.5 million, requested for the NOAA IOOS Program, will continue 
national  IOOS  implementation  efforts  and  development  of  an  IOOS  Data  Integra-
tion  Framework.  NOAA  has  made  progress  with  implementing  IOOS.  Some  exam-
ples of our work: 

awards; (resulting in 23 IOOS cooperative agreements); 

• Established a dedicated IOOS Program and developed a strategic plan; 
• Conducted the first peer-reviewed, competitive grants process for regional IOOS 
• Developed  a  prioritized  list  of  measurements,  based  on  feedback  from  users: 
• Established common processing standards to be applied nationally; and 
• Implemented  IOOS  Data  Integration  Framework  at  three  NOAA  centers  of 

temperature, salinity, sea level, surface currents, and ocean color; 

data, which will result in interoperable data. 

Making  progress  on  these  modest  steps  is  imperative  to  demonstrating  the  value 
of a U.S. IOOS and garnering the support to build the IOOS envisioned by the U.S. 
Commission on Ocean Policy and others. 

Question 5b. What is your opinion of the Ocean Commission’s assessment that an 

IOOS system will require upwards of $500 million to operate effectively? 

Answer.  The  U.S.  Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  called  for  a  fully  developed  IOOS 
in  10  years,  with  initial  estimates  of  annual  funding  on  the  order  of  $500  to  $750 
million. These cost values have not been independently evaluated. NOAA has made 
progress implementing IOOS under our current budget requests. Continued support 
for  research  and  development,  regional  observing  development,  and  data  manage-
ment  and  communication  efforts  will  be  required  to  fully  develop  the  U.S.  IOOS. 
NOAA  believes  IOOS  can  be  built  and  operated  in  phases,  with  a  level  of  new  in-
vestment much below the Ocean Commission’s estimate. 

To do this NOAA is focusing efforts internally and collaborating with its regional 
partners  to  build  and  demonstrate  the  viability  of  the  regional  and  data  manage-
ment  components.  NOAA  continues  to  be  committed  to  building  a  national  IOOS, 
and  is  providing  the  leadership,  management,  and  oversight  needed  to  facilitate  its 
development. 

Question  6a.  NOAA  is  now  in  the  second  year  of  running  a  competitive  national 
program to fund the regional research and operational components of the Integrated 
Ocean Observing System. The funding provided to the IOOS program last year was 
woefully insufficient, and as a direct result, the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing Sys-
tem,  just  one  of  eleven  such  systems  nationwide,  will  be  forced  to  remove  as  many 
as  half  of  its  buoys  from  the  water  this  year  because  they  simply  do  not  have  the 
money to continue operating them. Interrupting the continuity of these data streams 
will  have  consequences  beyond  baseline  research,  as  a  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic 
Institute study has shown that GoMOOS returns six dollars to the regional economy 
for every dollar invested. 

First  of  all,  what  does  NOAA  hope  to  gain  by  requiring  regional  observation  pro-
grams  to  compete  against  one  another?  Doesn’t  this  system  inherently  result  in  a 
set  of  winners  and  losers,  when  in  reality  we  should  be  trying  to  build  a  system 
in  which  all  regions  are  equally  ‘‘winners’’?  Why  not  promote  a  ‘‘merit  based’’  sys-
tem, as in S. 950? 

Answer.  With  the  FY  2007  Omnibus  Appropriation,  NOAA  initiated  a  transition 
from a collection of Congressionally-directed projects to a competitive award system 
to develop a national network of coastal ocean observing systems. 

NOAA is working to establish a national network of regional coastal ocean observ-
ing  systems  by  soliciting  high-quality  proposals  through  a  competitive  and  merit- 
based process. NOAA recognizes that past competitive processes may not have been 
optimal  to  support  a  national  network  and  we  are  looking  at  ways  to  structure  fu-

ture  funding  announcements,  such  that  competition  is  focused  within,  not  among, 
each of the 11 IOOS regions. 

NOAA  included  a  selection  criterion  within  its  FY  2008  Federal  Funding  An-
nouncement  that  allows  proposals  deemed  to  be  meritorious  of  funding  to  be  ele-
vated based on the need to maintain geographic distribution. NOAA continues to op-
erate a highly transparent funding process and works closely with its regional part-
ners on lessons learned to support a fair, yet robust process. 

Question  6b.  It  is  painfully  obvious  that  the  top  line  number—the  overall  pot  of 
money for these regional competitions—is too low. What was the total amount allo-
cated for FY07 and FY08? What is the amount requested for FY09? These numbers 
are not clearly identified in your request. 

Answer.  In  FY  2007,  NOAA  awarded  $22.4  million  to  support  regional  IOOS  de-
velopment,  including  the  eleven  IOOS  Regional  Associations  and  Regional  Coastal 
Ocean  Observing  Systems  (RCOOS).  This  included  23  IOOS  Development  awards 
spanning three focus areas: 

• Regional coastal ocean observing systems development; 
• IOOS applications and product development; and 
• Regional Data Management and Communication guidance and processes. 
In FY 2008, Congress appropriated $26.3 million for NOAA IOOS (approx. 58 per-
cent  above  the  President’s  Budget  Request).  NOAA  awarded  $20.4  million  of  the 
total  IOOS  appropriation  to  support  regional  IOOS  development.  This  included  11 
new  management  and  planning  awards  to  the  Regional  Associations  and  7  new 
RCOOS awards to continue development of regional ocean observing systems. 

The  FY  2009  request  for  ‘‘IOOS  Regional  Observations’’  is  $14.5  million.  NOAA 

intends to use these funds to support existing, multi-year, regional awards. 

Question  6c.  If  every  region  were  to  receive  the  amount  of  funding  warranted  to 
build an effective ocean observation program, how much funding would NOAA have 
to allocate for these regional programs? 

Answer.  NOAA  is  completing  program  assessments  within  each  IOOS  region  to 
better  understand  baseline  costs,  existing  capabilities,  and  diversity  of  funding 
sources. This review will serve as a basis for further analysis of regional needs and 
requirements. 

Question 6d. Some regions note that they cannot compete for funds, because they 
are  suffering  from  the  effects  of  being  under-funded  in  the  past.  Do  you  agree  with 
this  characterization?  How  can  NOAA  help  these  programs  get  on  a  more  competi-
tive footing? 

Answer.  NOAA  is  not  aware  that  some  regions  have  concluded  they  cannot  com-
pete  for  funds.  The  NOAA  IOOS  funding  process  is  transparent,  open,  and  con-
sistent  with  competitive  funding  processes  across  the  agency.  NOAA  is  working 
closely with our regional partners to develop viable observing capabilities with avail-
able resources. 

Question  7.  The  New  England  Fishery  Management  Council  is  currently  in  the 
process  of  developing  the  next  major  amendment  to  its  groundfish  fishery  manage-
ment  plan.  At  a  meeting  last  month,  the  Council  decided  to  table  proposals  to  ex-
plore  new  management  methods  to  replace  the  existing  days-at-sea  system.  Under 
the  present  system,  groundfishermen  have  an  average  of  just  47  days-at-sea.  Esti-
mates  suggest  these  levels  could  be  cut  by  as  much  as  an  additional  70  percent 
under Amendment 16, leaving the same fisherman with just 15 days to make a liv-
ing.  Has  NOAA  provided  funding  in  this  budget  to  determine  the  viability  and  po-
tential benefits of any groundfish management plan other than days-at-sea? Are any 
existing programs investigating other management measures? 

Answer. Yes. The FY 2009 President’s Budget requests an increase of $4.8 million 
to  develop  and  implement  Limited  Access  Privilege  Programs.  Of  this  amount, 
$1.142  million  is  preliminarily  allocated  to  the  Northeast  Region.  In  FY  2008, 
NOAA  is  funding  development  of  the  Amendment  16,  which  also  includes  develop-
ment  of  sector  management.  Through  sector  management  part  or  all  of  groundfish 
fishery  resources  (denominated  in  terms  of  catch)  would  be  allocated  to  various  in-
dustry sectors. One of the major benefits of self-selecting sectors is that they provide 
incentives to self-govern, therefore, reducing the need for the New England Fishery 
Management Council and NOAA Fisheries Service mandated measures. Sectors also 
are thought to reduce the risk of overfishing by operating under a hard total allow-
able  catch  (TAC)  for  at  least  some  species,  rather  than  input  controls  based  on  a 
target TAC. 

Question 8. The regulations established by NMFS in Amendment 13 call for a re-
view  of  the  plan  for  fishing  year  2009  using  information  based  on  a  2008  peer-re-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:44 Aug 29, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\75681.TXT JACKIE

viewed benchmark assessment. This assessment, also known as the GARM III, will 
not  be  completed  until  August  2008  at  the  earliest,  yet  the  Council  is  already  con-
sidering  plans  to  cut  Days-at-Sea  despite  the  fact  that  they  do  not  have  adequate 
data as mandated by NMFS’s own regulations. The Council’s current plan is to com-
plete  work  on  a  Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  Amendment  16  by  the 
first  week  in  June,  2  months  before  the  GARM  is  completed,  and  to  enact  a  final 
regulation  in  October  2008,  at  the  very  meeting  that  will  provide  the  public’s  first 
opportunity to hear a formal presentation of the data included in the GARM. 

Given  that  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  requires  the  Council  to  give  the  public  ‘‘a 
reasonable  opportunity  to  respond  to  new  data  or  information’’  before  taking  final 
action,  how  do  you  rationalize  this  schedule  for  implementation  of  Amendment  16 
with the requirements of Magnuson-Stevens? Why should the Council not delay ac-
tion on Amendment 16 until the necessary data can be appropriately considered and 
included in management measures? 

Answer.  Based  on  the  preliminary  results  of  the  assessment  process,  the  New 
England Fishery Management Council has determined that it is necessary to see the 
final scientific results before it can complete a draft document that will fully inform 
the  public  of  the  alternatives  under  consideration.  The  Council  will  continue  work-
ing  on  those  aspects  of  the  amendment  that  are  not  reliant  on  the  final  scientific 
results. Because it is unlikely that Amendment 16 measures will be in place at the 
beginning  of  the  new  fishing  year  (May  1,  2009),  the  agency  is  evaluating  options 
for ensuring that efforts to rebuild stocks and end overfishing are not compromised 
during this time. 

Question  9a.  The  2008  budget  request  included  $10  million  for  the  Penobscot 
River  Habitat  Restoration  Project—an  unprecedented  dam  purchase  and  removal 
partnership  among  Federal  and  State  agencies,  non-profit  organizations,  a  private 
electricity company, and the Penobscot Indian Nation that would retain over 95 per-
cent of the river’s electricity production while providing unrestricted access to nearly 
1,000 miles of unobstructed habitat for salmon and other diadromous species. Of the 
$25  million  Congress  directed  toward  the  Open  Rivers  Initiative  for  Fiscal  Year 
2008, how much of that is NOAA now putting toward the Penobscot River Restora-
tion Project? 

Answer.  Within  the  NOAA  budget  Congress  did  not  appropriate  $25  million  for 
the  Open  Rivers  Initiative  (ORI).  The  FY  2008  appropriation  permits  the  following 
under the Fisheries habitat Restoration line in the budget: 
• $10.0 million for Penobscot River habitat Restoration. 
• $12.9 million for Community-Based Restoration. 
• $1.6 million for Open Rivers Initiative. 
• $0.8 million for Chesapeake Bay Oyster Restoration. 
No  Open  Rivers  Initiative  funding  is  being  used  in  FY  2008  for  the  Penobscot 
River Restoration Project. The $10 million in FY 2008 for the Penobscot River Res-
toration Project is included in NOAA’s $25 million appropriated under the Fisheries 
Habitat Restoration line. 

Question  9b.  Going  forward  with  this  multi-year  project,  how  will  NOAA  decide 
how  to  allocate  funding  under  the  Open  Rivers  Initiative?  How  will  NOAA  engage 
its  Federal  partners  such  as  the  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  and  the  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers  to  help  defray  the  costs  of  large-scale  projects  like  the  Penobscot  River 
Restoration? 

Answer.  NOAA  requested  $7  million  in  FY  2009  for  the  Open  Rivers  Initiative. 
Projects selected for funding under the Open Rivers Initiative (ORI) must be a dam 
or  stream  barrier  removal  project  that  benefits  diadromous  fish  and  fosters  eco-
nomic, educational, and social benefits for the surrounding community. ORI is a na-
tionally  competitive  program,  with  applications  going  through  a  multiple  step  re-
view, ranking and selection process. Projects are ineligible if they are outside of the 
$1,000,000 maximum allowable request or the $30,000 minimum allowable request; 
or  if  the  dam  is  licensed  by  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)  at 
the time of proposal submission. NOAA also evaluates and selects projects according 
to NOAA’s standard evaluation criteria: 

1. Importance and Applicability of Proposal. 
2. Technical/Scientific Merit. 
3. Overall Qualifications of Applicants. 
4. Project Costs. 
5. Outreach, Education, and Community Involvement.

NOAA routinely partners with other Federal agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Natural Resources Con-
servation Service, to accomplish habitat restoration goals for coastal and river habi-
tats, including dam removals. 

Regarding the Penobscot River Restoration Project, NOAA is working closely with 
the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey,  and  the  U.S.  Army 
Corps  of  Engineers  on  acquisition,  removal  and  restoration  design,  and  permitting 
issues. NOAA will continue to work closely with these agencies and the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission as the Federal and state permitting processes progress 
throughout  FY  2008  and  into  FY  2009.  These  agencies  are  providing  critical  tech-
nical  assistance  and  funding  to  advance  the  project  to  the  next  stage.  NOAA  re-
mains committed to see the project through to completion and will continue to work 
with  our  Federal  partners  who  are  contributing  key  technical  and  financial  re-
sources to the project. 

Question  10.  The  FY  2009  budget  requests  $32.7  million  for  observer  coverage 
overall, on par with last year’s request and the enacted levels, but there is no infor-
mation  in  the  budget  request  specifying  how  much  of  that  will  go  to  the  New  Eng-
land  Groundfish  Observer  Program.  As  you  are  aware,  under  Amendment  13, 
NMFS must provide at least 10 percent observer coverage to monitor bycatch in the 
New  England  groundfishery  and  in  the  scallop  fishery.  How  much  funding  would 
you allocate for groundfish observers in New England? What percentage of coverage 
will this level of funding provide? 

Answer.  The  President’s  FY  2009  Budget  Request  for  the  New  England  Ground-
fish  Court-Ordered  Observers  budget  line  is  $8.619  million.  During  litigation  con-
cerning  Northeast  Multispecies  Fishery  Management  Plan  (FMP)  Amendment  9, 
NOAA Fisheries Service was temporarily ordered to provide either a 10 percent cov-
erage level or to determine the appropriate coverage level to provide statistically re-
liable bycatch information on all gear sectors in the Northeast Multispecies Fishery. 
NOAA  Fisheries  Service’s  analysis  suggested  that  5  percent  coverage  of  all  ground-
fish  days-at-sea  trips  was  sufficient  to  monitor  catches  and  discards  in  the  ground-
fish  fishery  with  an  acceptable  level  of  precision  and  accuracy.  Although  NOAA 
Fisheries Service is no longer subject to that court order, it has continued to provide 
a  5  percent  coverage  level  through  FY  2008  in  the  Northeast  Multispecies  Fishery 
to ensure statistically reliable information on groundfish bycatch levels. 

NOAA  Fisheries  Service  is  transitioning  to  a  Standardized  Bycatch  Reporting 
Methodology (SBRM) process, which is now mandated by the New England Fishery 
Management  Council.  The  SBRM  requires  a  method  to  allocate  sea  days  for  ob-
server coverage in all Northeast fisheries so that bycatch estimates are provided at 
a  reliable  level.  The  SBRM  includes  a  prioritization  and  consultation  process  with 
the  Fisheries  Management  Councils  in  the  Northeast  region.  The  data  is  also  ana-
lyzed statistically to ensure this level of coverage produces a sufficiently precise by-
catch estimate. 

The  sea  scallop  program  is  primarily  industry  funded  through  Amendment  13  to 
the Scallop FMP, although still supported by NOAA Fisheries Service funds for spe-
cific  activities.  It  is  difficult  to  project  the  number  of  observed  sea  days  that  will 
occur  through  an  industry  funded  program.  However,  in  FY  2006  a  total  of  2,200 
sea days were observed. Assuming this same level of observer coverage, NOAA Fish-
eries  Service  anticipated  funding  the  sea  scallop  industry-funded  program  at  ap-
proximately  $397,000  in  FY  2009.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  funds  are  used  to  cover 
the  72-hour  call  in  notifications,  data  processing,  data  quality  assurance  programs, 
program  oversight  to  attain  proper  coverage  and  sampling,  and  portions  of  the  ob-
server  training  and  sampling  gear.  Approximately  10  percent  of  the  trips  are  cur-
rently  observed  in  the  general  category  access  areas,  limited  access  areas,  and  lim-
ited  access  open  area  scallop  fisheries  (not  general  category  open  area).  Although 
this may change under the SBRM, coverage in the sea scallop fishery will be main-
tained at a level high enough to provide statistically valid bycatch estimates. 

Question  11.  Herring  has  been  described  as  a  ‘‘keystone  species’’  in  the  Gulf  of 
Maine ecosystem, serving as forage for larger species such as tuna and endangered 
northern right whales, as bait in the lobster industry, and as a commercially impor-
tant  species  in  its  own  right.  The  New  England  herring  fishery  is  also  in  need  of 
additional  observer  coverage  to  help  settle  many  ongoing  disagreements  about  the 
status  of  this  stock  and  its  harvest  and  bycatch  levels.  How  much  funding—and 
what  level  of  coverage—can  NMFS  devote  to  observer  coverage  in  the  herring  fish-
ery?  How  much  coverage  is  needed  to  truly  address  the  ongoing  questions  about 
stock and bycatch uncertainties? 

Answer. The Northeast Observer Program must now allocate observer coverage in 
the  herring  fishery  pursuant  to  the  Standardized  Bycatch  Reporting  Methodology

(SBRM), which is now mandated by the New England Fishery Management Council. 
The  FY  2009  budget  under  the  New  England  Groundfish  Court-Ordered  Observers 
budget  line  was  intended  to  provide  observer  coverage  in  the  herring  mid-water 
trawl  fishery  at  a  target  level  of  20  percent,  with  a  lower  coverage  rate,  closer  to 
5 percent for the purse seine herring fishery. With the transition to the new SBRM 
process,  the  target  coverage  levels  for  the  herring  fishery  will  need  to  be  reevalu-
ated.  The  specific  FY  2009  funding  amount  targeted  for  these  herring  fisheries  is 
approximately $460,000. 

The  Herring  Plan  Development  Team  is  actively  addressing  and  identifying  the 
monitoring  needs  of  the  herring  fishery  as  a  New  England  Fishery  Management 
Council  priority  through  the  proposed  Amendment  4  to  the  Herring  Fishery  Man-
agement Plan. The objectives of this Amendment include implementing measures to 
improve  the  long-term  monitoring  of  catch  in  the  herring  fishery,  consideration  of 
the health of the herring resources, and evaluation of the important role of herring 
as  forage  and  predator  fish  throughout  its  range.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  may 
adapt  or  readdress  target  levels  of  observer  coverage  as  the  need  for  coverage  is 
fully examined during this process. 

Question  12a.  There  are  concerns  about  NOAA’s  ability  to  provide  a  long-term, 
cost-effective  satellite  system  given  its  budgetary  constraints  and  its  recent  track 
record  beset  with  launch  delays  and  instrument  development  failures.  Most  re-
cently,  the  launch  date  for  the  NPOESS  Preparatory  satellite  was  pushed  back  an 
additional  9  months  to  June  2010.  This  launch  was  initially  scheduled  for  May  of 
2006,  so  we  are  now  looking  at  more  than  4  years  of  delay  and  when  the  NPOESS 
satellites  do  fly  they  will  be  lacking  many  key  instruments  initially  planned  to  be 
onboard.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  a  September  2007  National  Academy  of  Sciences  Re-
port  noted  that  in  January  2006,  more  than  120  instruments  were  used  to  collect 
climate  data—a  number  that  is  expected  to  drop  to  fewer  than  80  instruments  by 
2010,  a  decline  of  25  percent  or  more.  The  FY09  budget  includes  $74  million  to  re-
store  key  climate  sensors  cut  from  the  next  generation  of  environmental  satellites. 
Will this increased funding address the problems in the NAS report? 

Answer. The President’s FY 2009 Budget Request includes a $74 million initiative 
to fund the Administration’s commitment to restore two of the five high priority cli-
mate measurements that were demanifested from the National Polar-orbiting Oper-
ational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) in 2006. The Administration has 
previously addressed the other three high priority climate measurements. 

The  $74  million  budget  increase  will  fund  development  of  Total  Solar  Irradiance 
Sensor  (TSIS)  and  Clouds  and  Earth  Radiant  Energy  System  sensor  (CERES).  In 
2007, NOAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) jointly 
funded  restoration  of  Ozone  Mapper/Profiler  Suite-Limb  to  the  NPP  satellite.  How-
ever, full funding of the NPOESS-related budget requests in the appropriations bills 
for NOAA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Air 
Force appropriations bills is required to ensure that the climate sensors can be inte-
grated and launched on the respective NPP and NPOESS satellites. 

NOAA  and  NASA  have  determined  that  near-term  continuity  of  the  other  two 

measurements can be fulfilled through existing plans detailed below: 

• Continuity  of  radar  altimetry  measurements  can  be  fulfilled  through  the  Jason 
• Aerosol  measurements  can  be  fulfilled  with  the  2009  launch  of  the  Aerosol  Po-

2 mission that was successfully launched on June 20, 2008. 

larimeter Sensor on the NASA GLORY mission. 

NOAA and NASA, in collaboration with the Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy  and  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  continue  to  work  with  the  climate 
science  community  to  ensure  that  the  climate  sensors  are  developed  and  placed  in 
orbit in time to continue and enhance climate data collection and avoid an interrup-
tion of these important space-based climate measurements. 

Question  12b.  What  assurances  can  you  provide  that  we  will  not  simply  continue 

to see one instrument failure after another and an unending string of delays? 

Answer. NOAA, NASA, and the Air Force carefully assessed the processes and ca-
pabilities  required  to  build  these  instruments  and  place  them  onto  the  appropriate 
and  most  cost-effective  satellite.  Careful  consideration  was  given  to  cost,  schedule, 
and  technological  maturity  of  the  sensors,  as  well  as  the  capability  of  the  Federal 
Government and its contractors to successfully deliver the instruments. The conclu-
sion of this review indicated that the remanifested climate sensors are instruments 
that have been flown before or will be flown prior to being placed on an operational 
satellite. 

NOAA will work directly with NASA to build near-duplicate instruments (i.e., not 
push  for  new  unproven  technology),  in  order  to  limit  cost  growth  and  ensure  we

95 

meet  the  launch  schedules  of  the  NPOESS  Preparatory  Project  (NPP)  and  the  first 
NPOESS  satellites  (C–1).  These  climate  sensors  will  be  subject  to  demanding  test 
programs  that  will  identify  and  address  flaws  in  the  design  and  manufacturing  of 
the  instruments  prior  to  launch.  NOAA  and  NASA  believe  that  the  necessary  pro-
gram  management  and  engineering  oversight  processes  are  in  place  to  identify  and 
take the appropriate steps to mitigate cost, schedule, and risk of these climate sen-
sors to the NPP and NPOESS programs. 

Question 12c. Will the latest delay in the launch of the NPOESS Preparatory sat-

ellite cause additional cost increases? Will there be information gaps? 

Answer. The NPOESS Executive Committee (EXCOM) recently received a revised 
cost  estimate  from  the  DOD’s  Cost  Analysis  Improvement  Group  (CAIG).  This  esti-
mate  included  development,  production  and  operations  and  sustainment  costs  for 
the baseline program. Given the differences between the CAIG estimate and the In-
tegrated Program Office estimate, the EXCOM members are engaged in ongoing dis-
cussions to reconcile the two cost estimates and determine which estimate will form 
the basis of the NPOESS Acquisition Program Baseline (APB). Once the APB is up-
dated,  NOAA  will  inform  the  Committee  of  the  EXCOM  decision  and  implications 
of the revised estimate to the program. 

With respect to information gaps, existing NOAA, Air Force, and NASA Polar-or-
biting  satellites  continue  to  provide  data.  However,  as  we  get  closer  to  2010  the 
chances  of  specific  instrument  failures  on  these  existing  satellites  increases.  All 
three  agencies  will  manage  their  spacecraft  to  maximize  the  health  and  safety  of 
the  satellites  and  instruments  to  ensure  that  data  will  be  available  until  NPP  and 
NPOESS  are  launched.  Through  a  pre-existing  agreement  with  the  Europeans,  the 
MetOp satellite is on-orbit and also providing critical operational data. The real im-
pact of the NPP delay is the extended time to access and use the improved datasets 
that NPP will provide. The NPOESS Executive Committee and Integrated Program 
Office remain committed to mission success. 

Question  13a.  Apparently  NOAA  satellite  operations  has  uncovered  a  potentially 
serious battery issue on the GOES–11 (GOES West) satellite currently in orbit and 
covering  the  Pacific  Ocean  and  Western  United  States.  GOES–11  was  expected  to 
last  until  the  end  of  2011,  but  that  date  is  now  in  serious  jeopardy.  In  the  process 
of  preparing  the  batteries  for  eclipse  operations,  NOAA  found  that  one  of  the  two 
spacecraft batteries was having problems holding a charge. While the satellite could 
go  through  the  upcoming  months  without  a  problem,  there  is  a  particular  failure 
situation that could result in an end of life condition for the satellite. 

What  information  does  NOAA  receive  from  the  satellite—and  is  NOAA  prepared 
for  a  worst  case  scenario  if  adjustments  to  its  existing  battery  charging  procedures 
cannot  be  made  in  an  attempt  to  manage  the  GOES–11  problem?  What  will  this 
failure mean to the program? Will GOES–13 be used to collect the information that 
GOES West was expected to send back to NOAA until the end of 2011 or will there 
be gaps in data? 

Answer.  GOES–11,  which  was  launched  in  May  2000,  currently  serves  as  the 
operational ‘‘GOES-West’’ satellite and provides operational environmental data and 
other  services  for  the  western  United  States  and  Central  Pacific  regions.  GOES–11 
provides the following information: 

intervals. 

getic particle measurements. 

• Visible and infrared images of the Earth’s atmosphere, at 5, 15, and 30 minute 
• Space  environment  monitoring  data  including  Earth’s  magnetic  field  and  ener-
• Data collection system receives environmental data from surface based data col-
lection platforms and ocean buoys and relays them to users. Data are also used 
for tsunami detection and reservoir monitoring. 
• Search and rescue distress signals from aircraft, marine, and land based vessels 
• Broadcast  of  operational  weather  data  through  the  Low  Rate  Information 
Transfer  system  and  emergency  warnings  through  the  Emergency  Weather  In-
formation Network transponders. 

are relayed through the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System. 

GOES–11  battery  performance  degradation  was  first  observed  in  Fall  2004  as  a 
gradual decline in voltage. NOAA satellite operators modified battery charging pro-
cedures  to  allow  the  spacecraft  to  maintain  acceptable  voltage  by  reducing  power 
system  loads  during  the  approximately  70  minute  eclipse  period.  The  eclipse,  ap-
proximately  6  weeks  long,  occurs  in  the  Spring  and  Fall  months  when  the  Earth 
is between the spacecraft and the sun and the spacecraft is unable to charge its bat-
teries to acceptable levels in order to support nominal satellite operations.

NOAA satellite operators project that the gradual degradation of the batteries will 
worsen with time. During the Spring 2008 eclipse, NOAA identified a limited num-
ber of non-time critical services, including secondary payload instruments and com-
munication services that could be turned off during the eclipse periods. Additionally, 
NOAA took GOES–13 (the on-orbit spare spacecraft) out of on-orbit storage prior to 
eclipse  season  to  test  a  space  environment  sensor  and  left  it  in  an  operational  con-
figuration as a hot backup to GOES–11 in the event of a catastrophic failure of the 
GOES–11  power  system.  GOES–13  was  also  used  to  provide  an  alternate  source  of 
data communication and to provide SARSAT services during GOES–11 eclipse. 

In the event of a GOES–11 failure, NOAA is prepared to activate GOES–13 which 
will  supply  the  same  data  as  GOES–11  to  ensure  continuity  of  geostationary  envi-
ronmental  satellite  observations  over  the  western  U.S.  and  Central  Pacific.  Proce-
dures  have  been  developed  and  exercised  to  optimize  this  transition  in  the  event  it 
is required. With a failure of GOES–11 and the early activation of GOES–13, NOAA 
would not have an on-orbit spare spacecraft to meet all of its mission requirements 
until  the  launch  of  GOES–O  now  scheduled  for  December  2008.  Based  on  current 
analyses, NOAA does not anticipate a gap in geostationary environmental data cov-
erage, but the current situation underscores the importance of developing the next- 
generation GOES–R series so it will be launched and ready to provide uninterrupted 
data when the GOES–N,–O,–P series of satellite has finished its mission life. 

Question  14a.  A  bluefin  tuna  tagging  program  has  been  ongoing  in  the  north  At-
lantic since 1999, but the NOAA budget request and Congressional funding has not 
consistently supported this effort. I am very pleased to see the request for $850,000 
in  the  NOAA  FY09  budget  request.  Bluefin  tuna  is  one  of  the  most  valuable  fish 
in  the  ocean—individual  fish  can  bring  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars  at  auction—yet 
in recent years, the fishery has declined precipitously. Many scientists and resource 
managers believe that lax regulatory practices in Europe and elsewhere are largely 
to blame for this decline. However, without strong science to back these claims, the 
U.S.’s  assertions  that  our  sustainable  management  practices  are  being  undermined 
by other countries’ policies carry little water. 

Despite  an  uneven  recent  history  of  requesting  and  enacting  funding  for  bluefin 
tuna  tagging,  has  NMFS  been  able  to  maintain  this  program  year  after  year?  To 
what  extent  have  lapses  in  data  collection  impacted  the  long-term  viability  of  the 
study? 

Answer.  NOAA  Fisheries  Service  has  not  been  able  to  maintain  this  program  in 
all years, largely because funding levels have been inconsistent due to Congressional 
earmarks.  In  the  FY  2008  enacted  budget,  this  program  was  funded  at  $446,000 
under an earmark. The FY 2009 Budget request includes $850,000 for this program. 
However,  different  research  teams  (primarily  academics)  have  conducted  electronic 
tagging  of  bluefin  tuna  using  a  variety  of  funding  sources,  including  Congressional 
funding  and  private  funds.  A  consistent  level  of  funding  for  NOAA  would  ensure 
their long-term viability, to more directly address management questions, and to in-
crease  NOAA’s  access  to  the  resulting  data.  It  should  be  noted  that  other  scientific 
research  tools,  such  as  genetics  and  microchemical  analyses,  also  aid  in  under-
standing better stock structure and the impacts that eastern Atlantic fisheries have 
on the western population of bluefin tuna. 

Question  14b.  How  has  a  lack  of  data  affected  the  U.S.  position  at  ICCAT?  What 
else can we do to increase ICCAT members’ attention to the need to study and con-
serve these stocks? 

Answer.  The  United  States  needs  strong  and  reliable  data  for  accurate  estimates 
of  the  fraction  of  the  total  catch  by  fishermen  in  the  eastern  Atlantic  comprised  of 
fish  from  the  western  stock,  as  well  as  how  the  decline  of  the  eastern  stock  affects 
U.S. catches of bluefin tuna. These data help to make a strong case for the conserva-
tion of the eastern stock. 

Last  year,  compliance  concerns  together  with  the  steep  decline  of  the  eastern 
stock,  led  the  United  States  to  propose  a  temporary  suspension  of  the  eastern 
bluefin  tuna  fishery  until  such  time  as  countries  could  demonstrate  control  of  their 
fisheries.  The  United  States  proposal  did  not  achieve  consensus.  Harvesters  did 
agree  to  report  in  detail  on  their  implementation  of  eastern  bluefin  tuna  fishery 
rules  before  the  2008  ICCAT  meeting.  The  United  States  will  review  over  the  com-
ing  months  the  steps  taken  by  eastern  harvesters  to  comply  with  ICCAT’s  rules.  It 
is  too  early  to  say  where  that  review  will  lead  us.  Measures  to  improve  compliance 
with  eastern  Atlantic  and  Mediterranean  bluefin  tuna  measures  remain  a  U.S.  pri-
ority.  In  general,  compliance  discussions  at  ICCAT  should  be  much  more  robust 
than in the past as the United States now chairs the Compliance Committee. 

In  addition  to  compliance  discussions,  the  management  measures  for  the  eastern 
Atlantic  and  Mediterranean  stock  of  bluefin  tuna  will  be  reviewed  by  ICCAT  this

fall following completion of a new stock assessment. NOAA expects that ICCAT will 
need  to  adopt  new  measures  to  reduce  mortality  on  this  stock  substantially.  This 
will be a high priority for the United States at ICCAT this year. 

Question  15a.  Harmful  algal  blooms  and  hypoxia  continue  to  wreak  havoc  on  our 
ocean  and  coastal  waters—and  the  number,  size,  duration,  ecological  effects,  and 
economic impacts of these events only continue to grow with each passing year. Ac-
cording to NOAA’s own online report, the U.S. seafood and tourism industries alone 
suffer losses of $82 million to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia annually, and these 
numbers are likely to continue to grow. Yet it is very unclear what the Administra-
tion  proposed  to  do  about  this  in  the  future—any  effort  that  NOAA  is  devoting  to 
these outbreaks seems to be buried in the FY09 budget request. 

How  much  funding  is  NOAA  requesting  for  harmful  algal  bloom  and  hypoxia  ac-
tivities  in  FY09?  On  what  would  you  spend  this  funding?  And  how  did  you  spend 
the funding allocated to this program in FY08? 

Answer. The FY 2009 President’s Request includes $15.8 million for NCCOS Com-
petitive Research, of which NOAA expects to spend at least $8.9 million on research 
related to harmful algal blooms (HABs) and hypoxia. The Harmful Algal Bloom and 
Hypoxia  Research  and  Control  Act  (HABHRCA)  is  primarily  implemented  through 
the  suite  of  competitive  national  grant  programs  (ECOHAB,  MERHAB,  NGOMEX, 
CHRP)  supported  through  the  NCCOS  Competitive  Research  line  (formerly  ‘‘Extra-
mural Research’’). Congress’ long-term and continued support of HABHRCA has en-
abled  NOAA  to  provide  tools  in  areas  that  are  necessary  for  managers  to  respond 
to  and  predict  annual  HAB  and  hypoxia  events  such  as  those  affecting  the  New 
England,  Gulf  of  Mexico,  Pacific  Northwest  and  California  coasts  as  well  as  the 
Great  Lakes.  Products  include  development  and  transition  of  regionally-specific  de-
tection  and  analysis  methods,  coupled  biological-physical  models,  enhanced  state 
and local government HAB monitoring capacity in both marine and freshwater envi-
ronments and new methods for prevention, control and mitigation. 

NOAA is in the process of finalizing FY 2008 funding recommendations for grants 
related  to  HAB  and  hypoxia  research.  The  release  of  specific  funding  information 
regarding  individual  grants  is  restricted  until  final  awards  are  made.  NOAA  can 
provide  this  funding  information  on  specific  projects  related  to  HABs  and  hypoxia 
funded in FY 2008 later in the fiscal year. 

Question  15b.  How  is  NOAA  increasing  its  ability  to  work  with  regions,  states, 
and  local  communities  to  respond  to  and  mitigate  the  impacts  of  these  outbreaks? 
As  we  craft  a  new  bill  to  reauthorize  the  Harmful  Algal  Bloom  and  Hypoxia  Re-
search and Control Act, what lessons have we learned to guide future efforts? 

Answer.  NOAA  is  taking  two  steps  to  increasing  regional  HAB  and  hypoxia  ef-
forts.  The  first  step  is  to  conduct  regional  workshops  to  assess  research  and  re-
sponse  needs  and  develop  plans.  Examples  of  previous  and  planned  efforts  include: 
• April 2006—Hypoxia in the Northern Gulf of Mexico: Assessing the State of the 

• July 2006—State of the Research on Red Tide in the Gulf of Mexico: Workshop 

• April 2006—Hypoxia in the Northern Gulf of Mexico: Assessing the State of the 

Science Symposium; 

and Public Forum; 

Science Symposium; 

• January 2007—Summit on Long-term Monitoring of the Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic 
Zone:  developing  the  Implementation  Plan  for  an  Operational  Observation  Sys-
tem; 

• March 2007—Ecological Impacts of Hypoxia on Living Resources; 
• January  2008—Mississippi  River/Gulf  of  Mexico  Watershed  Nutrient  Task 

Force EPA Science Advisory Board Hypoxia Advisory Panel Report; 

• April 2008—Regional Workshop for Harmful Algal Blooms in California Coastal 

• June 2008—Gulf of Maine Operational Forecasting Workshop; 
• September  2008—West  Coast  Regional  HAB  Workshop,  during  the  West  Coast 

Governors’ Agreement (WCGA) on Ocean Health; and 

• December 2008—Nuisance Macroalgal Blooms in coastal Maui: assessment and 

integration of physical factors and biological processes. 

Waters; 

The  second  step  is  to  use  the  information  we  gather  during  the  regional  work-
shops to set research funding priorities for our HAB and hypoxia programs on a re-
gional  basis.  This  approach  is  based  on  lessons  learned  over  the  last  10  years  of 
HAB and hypoxia research. Some lessons we have learned:

and impacts of HABs; 

• Effective  HAB  and  hypoxia  management  is  based  on  understanding  the  causes 
• There  are  many  immediate  short  term  benefits  to  HAB  and  hypoxia  research. 
For  example,  the  development  of  methods  to  detect  HAB  cells  and  toxins  is  es-
sential to monitoring and early warning and is usually the first product of HAB 
research. Examples of more long term products are annual predictions of bloom 
or  hypoxia  severity,  development  of  prevention  strategies,  and  development  of 
new control methods; 
• The ability to provide assistance during events is critical to resource and public 
health  managers  in  the  face  of  new  or  large  HAB  or  hypoxia  events.  Further, 
data obtained during severe outbreaks of HABs or hypoxia has greatly advanced 
our understanding of these events and our ability to predict and manage them; 
• Making  research  products  such  as  new  control  methods,  prevention  strategies, 
and  forecasting  abilities  operational  is  a  challenge  that  requires  considerable 
testing through pilot projects at different scales; and 
• HABs  and  hypoxia  are  regionally  specific  occurrences  that  are  best  addressed 

on a regional basis. 

Question  15c.  In  your  opinion,  should  Congress  focus  on  preventing  or  mitigating 
these  outbreaks?  Would  it  be  more  cost  effective  to  focus  on  prevention  or  mitiga-
tion? 

Answer.  Both  prevention  and  mitigation  are  essential  goals.  Many  mitigation 
strategies  can  be  implemented  quickly.  Prevention,  on  the  other  hand,  requires  a 
more thorough understanding of the causes of a HAB occurrence and the long-term 
management efforts needed to reduce the distribution and severity of blooms. Some 
blooms cannot be controlled at all or only to a limited extent so, for these, mitigation 
is  the  only  option.  Proposed  regional  research  and  action  plans  (mentioned  in  the 
response to 15b) can be used to evaluate the most effective course of action—mitiga-
tion, prevention or both—for each regional HAB problem.
