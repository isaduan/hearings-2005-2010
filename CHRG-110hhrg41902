BACKGROUND

Overview

NASA has long been a major source of the Nation’s aeronautical research and de-
velopment  (R&D),  R&D  that  has  found  application  in  both  civil  and  military  sys-
tems.  However,  funding  for  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  has  been  in  decline  for  a
major  portion  of  the  decade,  in  spite  of  recent  congressional  efforts  to  reverse  that
negative  trend.  In  addition,  beginning  in  late  2005,  NASA  began  restructuring  its
aeronautics  program  to  move  away  from  a  program  that  included  technology  dem-
onstration projects and R&D that led to greater technology maturity towards a pro-
gram focused on more fundamental research. These changes in NASA’s Aeronautics
R&D program occur at a time when the Next Generation Air Transportation System
initiative known as NextGen is ramping up and increased concerns about aviation’s
actual and potential impact on the environment are growing.

NextGen is intended to transform the existing air traffic control system to accom-
modate  projected  growth  in  air  passenger  and  cargo  rates  over  the  next  decade.  As
part of this modernization, NextGen aims to develop a more efficient and more envi-
ronmentally  friendly  national  air  transportation  system,  while  maintaining  safety.
The  development  of  NextGen  is  being  overseen  by  the  Joint  Planning  and  Develop-
ment  Office  (JPDO),  a  joint  initiative  of  the  Department  of  Transportation,  NASA,
Commerce, Defense Homeland Security, and the White House OSTP. FAA has tradi-
tionally  relied  on  NASA  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  R&D  related  to  air  traffic
management  as  well  as  research  to  help  address  substantial  noise,  emissions,  effi-
ciency,  performance,  and  safety  challenges  that  are  required  to  ensure  vehicles  can
support the NextGen vision.

NASA’s  capabilities  are  likely  to  be  needed  even  more  in  the  years  ahead  as
worldwide  debate  intensifies  over  how  to  deal  with  climate  change  caused  by  avia-
tion.  Aviation  greenhouse  gas  emissions  dominated  the  discussions  last  year  at  the
ICAO  Assembly  in  Montreal.  And  in  late  2007,  the  European  Union  continued  dis-
cussions  on  how  to  impose  its  emissions  trading  system  on  international  aviation.
R&D  will  be  needed  in  several  areas  to  meet  the  objectives  of  improving  scientific
understanding  of  the  impacts  of  aviation;  accelerating  air  traffic  management  im-
provements and efficiencies to reduce fuel burn; hastening the development of prom-
ising environmental improvements in aircraft technology; and exploring alternatives
to current greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting fuels for aviation.

Promising research is already being conducted by NASA in several of these areas,
including  collaborations  with  industry  for  research  at  the  system  level  on  projects
such  as  the  X–48B  Blended  Wing  with  Boeing,  Geared  Turbo  Fan  with  Pratt  &
Whitney, and sonic boom suppression technologies with Gulfstream Aerospace. How-
ever, the declining funding for Aeronautics R&D in NASA’s budgets provides a wor-
risome  backdrop  that  calls  into  question  the  Agency’s  ability  to  meet  the  expecta-
tions of federal and private sector partners. The assessment of NASA’s Aeronautics
Research  Program  just  completed  by  a  Committee  established  by  the  National  Re-
search Council (NRC) reinforces concern over NASA’s ability to successfully conduct
a comprehensive aeronautics R&D program under the budgets given to NASA’s aer-
onautics program.

Projecting what the air transportation system will look like and anticipating how
to deal with increased demand, the integration of new aircraft technology in the Na-
tional  Airspace  System,  safety  issues,  and  aviation’s  effect  on  the  environment  will
require  a  responsive  aeronautics  R&D  program  at  NASA.  However,  NASA’s  Aero-
nautics  Research  Program  will  be  severely  challenged  in  attempting  to  address
those issues under current budgetary trends.

Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Request

NASA’s  FY09  budget  provides  $446.5  million  for  the  Aeronautics  Research  Pro-
gram  under  the  direction  of  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  (ARMD).  It
should be noted that NASA’s FY 2009 budget has been restructured pursuant to the
Consolidated  Appropriation  Act,  2008,  and  is  now  presented  in  seven  accounts.  In
addition,  the  budget  estimates  presented  in  the  FY  2009  request  are  in  direct  pro-
gram dollars rather than in the full cost dollars used in previous Presidential budg-
et  requests.  From  a  direct  cost  perspective,1 the  proposed  FY09  budget  for  Aero-

1 As  part  of  the  budget  restructuring,  NASA  shifted  from  a  full-cost  budget,  in  which  each
project  budget  included  overhead  costs,  to  a  direct  cost  budget.  All  overhead  budget  estimates
are  now  consolidated  into  the  Cross  Agency  Support  budget  line.  NASA  has  stated  that  main-
taining a full cost budget with seven appropriations accounts would be overly complex and inef-
ficient.  The  direct  cost  budget  shows  program  budget  estimates  that  are  based  entirely  on  pro-

nautics Research is a decrease of $65.2 million from that appropriated in FY08. This
continues  a  multi-year  trend  of  declines  in  the  budget  requests  for  NASA’s  aero-
nautics programs.

The Aeronautics Research Program budget funds:

• Fundamental Aeronautics. The FY09 request for Fundamental Aeronautics is
$235.4 million, a decrease of $34.5 million from the $269.9 million enacted in
FY08.  Long-term  research  conducted  by  the  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Pro-
gram  will  be  used  to  provide  feasible  solutions  to  the  performance  and  envi-
ronmental  challenges  of  future  air  vehicles.  Research  efforts  in  revolutionary
configurations,  lighter  and  stiffer  materials,  improved  propulsion  systems,
and  advanced  concepts  for  high-lift  and  drag  reduction  all  target  the  effi-
ciency  and  environmental  compatibility  of  future  air  vehicles.  NASA’s  FY09
budget  request  says  that  space  exploration  activities  will  benefit  from  funda-
mental  technology  advances  that  can  impact  the  Agency’s  future  ability  to
both access space and survive the planetary entry, descent, and landing phase
of missions to other planetary surfaces.

• Airspace  Systems.  The  FY09  request  for  Airspace  Systems  is  $74.6  million,
a decrease of $25.5 million from the $100.1 million enacted in FY08. The Air-
space Systems Program is intended to address the air traffic management re-
search  needs  of  NextGen  in  collaboration  with  the  member  agencies  of  the
JPDO. NASA is working with the JPDO as well as other government, indus-
try, and academic partners to enable the formation, development, integration,
and demonstration of revolutionary concepts, capabilities, and technologies in-
tended  to  allow  significant  increases  in  capacity,  efficiency,  and  flexibility  of
the National Airspace System.

• Aviation  Safety.  The  FY09  request  for  Aviation  Safety  is  $62.6  million,  a  de-
crease  of  $3.9  million  from  the  $66.5  million  enacted  in  FY08.  The  program
builds  on  NASA’s  unique  safety-related  research  capabilities  to  improve  air-
craft  safety  for  current  and  future  aircraft,  and  to  overcome  aircraft  safety
technological  barriers  that  would  otherwise  constrain  the  full  realization  of
NextGen. To that end, NASA says that it is focusing its Aviation Safety Pro-
gram  on  developing  cutting-edge  technologies  to  improve  the  intrinsic  safety
attributes of current and future aircraft that will operate in NextGen. For ex-
ample, NASA’s work on an Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck will include re-
search into a forward looking sense-and avoid concept aimed at detecting haz-
ardous icing conditions with ground-based and on-board sensing technologies,
a  potentially  significant  safety  capability  for  the  flying  public.  Furthermore,
the Aviation Safety Program supports NASA’s human and robotic exploration
missions by advancing knowledge, tools, and technologies in areas relevant to
operations in harsh environments.

• Aeronautics  Test  Program.  The  FY09  request  for  the  Aeronautics  Test  Pro-
gram  is  $73.9  million,  a  decrease  of  $1.2  million  from  the  $75.1  million  en-
acted  in  FY08.  Prior  to  2005,  NASA’s  management  approach  for  major  test
facilities was for each NASA Research Center to be fully responsible for their
Center’s  facilities.  NASA  believed  that  this  approach  limited  the  potential
ability to pursue Agency-wide approaches and hampered interaction. In 2006,
the  Aeronautics  Test  Program  was  developed  to  establish  corporate  manage-
ment of NASA’s aeronautics ground test facilities. This was done, NASA says
in its FY09 budget request, to optimize utilization of the Agency’s wind tunnel
and air breathing propulsion test facility assets for efficiency and cost effective-
ness;  to  sustain  and  improve  NASA’s  core  capability  of  wind  tunnel  and  air
breathing  propulsion  testing;  and  to  ensure  a  minimum  core  capability  is
maintained.

NASA’s out-year projections for the Aeronautics Research in the President’s FY09
budget  request  show  only  minor  changes  in  projected  funding  levels  through  2013.
As  a  point  of  comparison,  NASA  Aeronautics  funding  was  about  $1.85  billion  (2006
dollars)  in  1994—the  current  budget  request  is  thus  only  about  24  percent  of  that
level.

cluding management of overhead costs.

Congressional Direction to Develop a National Aeronautics R&D Policy and

Plan

In  the  2005  NASA  Authorization  Act,  Congress  reaffirmed  the  national  commit-
ment  to  aeronautics  research  made  in  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Act  of
1958  and  went  on  to  state  that  ‘‘Aeronautics  research  and  development  remains  a
core  mission  of  NASA.  NASA  is  the  lead  agency  for  civil  aeronautics  research.’’  The
Act also directed that the government of the United States ‘‘promote aeronautics re-
search and development that will expand the capacity, ensure the safety, and increase
the  efficiency  of  the  Nation’s  air  transportation  system,  promote  the  security  of  the
Nation,  protect  the  environment,  and  retain  the  leadership  of  the  United  States  in
global aviation.’’ The Act also directed the development of a national policy to guide
the  aeronautics  research  and  development  programs  of  the  United  States  through
2020. The policy was to include national goals for aeronautics research and develop-
ment  and  describe  the  role  and  responsibilities  of  each  Federal  agency  that  will
carry out the policy.

In addition, the Act specified that the national aeronautics research and develop-
ment  policy  describe  for  NASA  (a)  the  priority  areas  of  research  for  aeronautics
through fiscal year 2011; (b) the basis on which and the process by which priorities
for  ensuing  fiscal  years  will  be  selected;  (c)  the  facilities  and  personnel  needed  to
carry  out  the  aeronautics  program  through  fiscal  year  2011;  and  (d)  the  budget  as-
sumptions on which the policy is based.

In  developing  the  national  aeronautics  research  and  development  policy,  the  Act

specified consideration of several issues, namely:

• The  extent  to  which  NASA  should  focus  on  long-term,  high-risk  research  or
more  incremental  research,  and  the  expected  impact  of  that  decision  on  the
United  States  economy,  and  the  ability  to  achieve  environmental  and  other
public goals related to aeronautics.

• The extent to which NASA should address military and commercial needs.
• How  NASA  will  coordinate  its  aeronautics  program  with  other  federal  agen-

• The extent to which NASA will conduct research in-house, fund university re-
search, and collaborate on industry research, and the expected impact of that
mix of funding on the supply of United States workers for the aeronautics in-
dustry.

cies.

In  response  to  the  congressional  direction,  the  Bush  Administration  released  its
National  Aeronautics  Research  and  Development  Policy,  along  with  its  accom-
panying Executive Order 13419. That policy established principles and objectives to
drive  federal  aeronautics  R&D  activities  and  guidelines  that  delineate  agency  roles
and  responsibilities  in  (a)  stable  and  long-term  foundational  research;  (b)  advanced
aircraft  systems  development;  (c)  air  transportation  management  systems;  and  (d)
national  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation  infrastructure.  The  Policy  also
called  for  an  infrastructure  plan  for  managing  critical  federal  research,  develop-
ment, test and evaluation (RDT&E) assets.

The  National  Aeronautics  R&D  Policy  laid  out  seven  key  principles  to  guide  the
conduct  of  the  Nation’s  aeronautics  R&D  activities  through  2020.  These  principles
(with  two  exceptions  discussed  later)  served  as  the  framework  for  the  R&D  Plan
issued in December 2007:

as a nation.

• Mobility  through  the  air  is  vital  to  economic  stability,  growth,  and  security
• Aviation is vital to national security and homeland defense.
• Aviation safety is paramount.

For  each  principle  addressed  in  the  plan,  the  state-of-the-art  of  related  tech-
nologies  and  systems  was  provided  as  well  as  a  set  of  fundamental  challenges  and
associated  high-priority  R&D  goals  and  supporting  objectives  for  each  goal.  Objec-
tives  are  phased  over  three  time  periods:  near-term  (<5  years),  mid-term  (5–10
years),  and  far-term  (>10  years).  Two  principles  in  the  Policy  are  being  addressed
in  different  efforts.  Specifically,  Aviation  security  R&D  efforts  are  coordinated
through the National Strategy for Aviation Security and its supporting plans. Aero-
space  workforce  issues  are  being  explored  by  the  Aerospace  Revitalization  Task
Force led by the Department of Labor.

The  infrastructure  plan  called  for  in  the  2005  Authorization  Act  has  yet  to  be
completed.  The  R&D  Plan  issued  in  December  2007  outlined  future  steps  in  devel-
oping  the  RDT&E  infrastructure  plan  that  will  focus  on  the  critical  RDT&E  assets
and capabilities necessary to support the aeronautics R&D goals and objectives laid
forth  in  this  Plan.  The  RDT&E  infrastructure  includes  experimental  facilities  and
computational  resources,  as  well  as  the  cyber-infrastructure  that  serves  to  connect
the  two.  The  supplemental  infrastructure  plan  will  also  address  an  approach  for
constructing,  maintaining,  modifying,  or  terminating  assets  based  on  the  needs  of
the broad user community.

Establishing  Research  Priorities:  NRC’s  Decadal  Survey  of  Civil  Aero-

nautics

In  2005,  NASA  contracted  with  the  NRC  to  develop  a  consensus  document  rep-
resenting  the  external  (industry  and  academia)  community’s  views  about  what
NASA’s  aeronautics  research  priorities  ought  to  be.  The  Decadal  Survey  of  Civil
Aeronautics was the first decadal survey ever produced for NASA’s aeronautics pro-
gram.  Eighty-five  aeronautics  experts  from  academia,  industry,  and  federal  labora-
tories met and worked over a one-year period to develop a consensus document. The
report laid out five key areas for research: aerodynamics and aeroacoustics; propul-
sion  and  power;  materials  and  structures;  dynamics,  navigation  and  control,  and
avionics;  and  intelligent  and  autonomous  systems,  operations  and  decision-making,
human  integrated  systems,  networking  and  communications.  Overall,  the  Decadal
Survey laid out a prioritized list of 51 challenges to address and recommended that
NASA use them as the foundation for its aeronautics program over the next decade.
The  report  was  the  subject  of  hearings  before  the  House  Committee  on  Science
and  Technology’s  Subcommittee  on  Space  and  Aeronautics  in  July  and  September
of  2006.  At  the  first  of  those  hearings,  then  Subcommittee  Chairman  Ken  Calvert
raised  concern  over  instability  in  NASA’s  aeronautics  R&D  program,  saying  that
‘‘NASA’s  aeronautics  program  has,  in  recent  years,  been  prone  to  changes  in  leader-
ship and program goals and strategies.’’ At that same hearing, then Ranking Demo-
cratic Member Mark Udall called for investing in aeronautics R&D, thereby leading
to such important efforts as enhancing the capability of America’s air transportation
system  and  enabling  more  environmentally  compatible  aircraft  with  significantly
lower noise emissions and energy consumption relative to aircraft currently in serv-
ice. He also warned that ‘‘if we don’t reverse this budgetary decline that NASA’s aer-
onautics program is undergoing, we are not going to have the robust and vital R&D
program we need and the [NRC] report envisions.’’

NRC’s Assessment of NASA’s Aeronautics Research Program

The 2005 NASA Authorization Act directed the NASA Administrator to enter into
an  arrangement  with  the  NRC  for  an  assessment  of  the  Nation’s  future  require-
ments  for  fundamental  aeronautics  research  and  whether  the  Nation  will  have  a
skilled research workforce and research facilities commensurate with those require-
ments.  The  assessment  was  to  include  an  identification  of  any  projected  gaps,  and
recommendations  for  what  steps  should  be  taken  by  the  Federal  Government  to
eliminate those gaps.

The  Committee  for  the  Assessment  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research  Program
found  that  ‘‘even  though  the  NASA  aeronautics  program  has  the  technical  ability  to
address  each  of  the  highest-priority  R&T  challenges  from  the  Decadal  Survey  indi-
vidually (through in-house research and/or partnerships with external research orga-

8

nizations),  ARMD  would  require  a  substantial  budget  increase  to  address  all  of  the
challenges in a thorough and comprehensive manner.’’

The Committee recommended that NASA:

• Ensure  that  ‘‘its  research  program  substantively  advances  the  state  of  the  art
and  makes  a  significant  difference  in  a  time  frame  of  interest  to  users  of  the
research results by (1) making a concerted effort to identify the potential users
of  ongoing  research  and  how  that  research  relates  to  those  needs  and  (2)
prioritizing  potential  research  opportunities  according  to  an  accepted  set  of
metrics.  In  addition,  absent  a  substantial  increase  in  funding  and/or  a  sub-
stantial  reduction  in  other  constraints  that  NASA  faces  in  conducting  aero-
nautics  research  (such  as  facilities,  workforce  composition,  and  federal  poli-
cies), NASA, in consultation with the aeronautics research community and oth-
ers  as  appropriate,  should  redefine  the  scope  and  priorities  within  the  aero-
nautics research program to be consistent with available resources and the pri-
orities  identified  in  (2),  above  (even  if  all  51  highest-priority  R&T  challenges
from  the  Decadal  Survey  of  Civil  Aeronautics  are  not  addressed  simulta-
neously).  This  would  improve  the  value  of  the  research  that  the  aeronautics
program is able to perform, and it would make resources available to facilitate
the development of new core competencies and unique capabilities that may be
essential  to  the  Nation  and  to  the  NASA  aeronautics  program  of  the  future.’’
• Bridge  ‘‘the  gap  between  research  and  application—and  thereby  increase  the
likelihood  that  this  research  will  be  of  value  to  the  intended  users.’’  Further-
more,  the  Committee  recommended  that  NASA,  for  ‘‘technology  intended  to
enhance  the  competitiveness  of  U.S.  industry,  establish  a  more  direct  link  be-
tween  NASA  and  U.S.  industry  to  provide  for  technology  transfer  in  a  way
that  does  not  necessarily  include  the  immediate,  public  dissemination  of  re-
sults to potential foreign competitors.’’
• Develop  ‘‘a  vision  describing  the  role  of  its  research  staff  as  well  as  a  com-
prehensive, centralized strategic plan for workforce integration and implemen-
tation  specific  to  ARMD.  The  plan  should  be  based  on  an  ARMD-wide  survey
of staffing requirements by skill level, coupled with an availability analysis of
NASA civil servants available to support the NASA aeronautics program. The
plan  should  identify  specific  gaps  and  the  time  frame  in  which  they  should
be  addressed  NASA  should  reduce  the  impact  of  facility  shortcomings  by  con-
tinuing  to  assess  facilities  and  mothball  or  decommission  facilities  of  lesser
importance so that the most important facilities can be properly sustained.’’

The Challenge of Sustaining an Efficient, Environmentally Compatible, and

Safe Aviation System in the Face of Increasing Demand

As evidenced by frequent reports of flight delays around the country, the Nation’s
air  transportation  system  is  reaching  saturation.  The  number  of  passengers  using
the  system  has  been  climbing  steadily.  In  2006,  passengers  exceeded  750  million;
it  is  likely  that  between  2012  and  2015,  the  number  of  passengers  could  reach  one
billion  each  year.  At  that  point,  the  air  transportation  system  will  be  reaching  its
limits. Some models project that the number of passengers could double or even tri-
ple by the year 2025.

In  the  U.S.,  the  major  effort  to  develop  a  new  air  transportation  system  falls
under  the  aegis  of  NextGen.  The  vision  for  NextGen  is  a  system  that  is  based  on
satellite navigation and control, digital non-voice communication and advanced net-
working.  Furthermore,  NextGen  envisions  shifting  of  decision-making  from  the
ground to the cockpit. Flight crews will have increased control over their flight tra-
jectories and ground controllers will become traffic flow managers. The air transpor-
tation system of the future will likely need to accommodate new flight regimes such
as  supersonic  flight  and  the  emergence  of  scheduled  vertical  and  short  take-off  and
landing  (V/STOL)  airline  operations.  Recent  aircraft  groundings  for  inspection  of
wiring  bundles  remind  us  that  aviation  safety  issues  associated  with  existing  air-
craft will also continue to need to be addressed.

There  has  long  been  a  recognition  of  the  need  for  R&D  to  minimize  the  adverse
impacts  on  the  environment,  namely  in  the  areas  of  aircraft  noise  around  airports,
energy  consumption,  and  engine  emissions.  This  is  particularly  important  in  light
of the expected growth in air travel projected in the next decade. Some progress has
been  achieved  in  noise  reduction  for  conventional  fixed  wing  aircraft.  FAA  cites  a
decrease  from  seven  million  to  half  a  million  people  exposed  to  significant  aircraft
noise  in  the  past  thirty  years,  this  despite  a  significant  number  of  passenger
emplanements. Such a reduction was made possible through the evolution of aircraft
powerplants,  from  the  use  of  turbojets  to  more  efficient  and  quieter  generations  of
turbofans which have benefited from NASA R&D. However, noise remains a signifi-

cant  issue,  particularly  around  the  Nation’s  busiest  airports  and  more  needs  to  be
done. Noise also has been a significant challenge for civil V/STOL aircraft.

Airlines and other users of the Nation’s air transportation system are particularly
sensitive to the cost of fuel, and R&D to increase aircraft energy efficiency has been
a  significant  focus  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  R&D  program  at  various  times.  Yet  tech-
nical or operational measures to promote energy efficiency have to be considered in
the context of the overall aviation system. As a result, air transportation is particu-
larly  sensitive  to  requirements  that  may  impact  on  fuel  efficiency.  For  example,
higher fuel consumption is oftentimes the result of having to design aircraft capable
of meeting airport noise restrictions. For that reason, there is high interest in future
powerplants  that  are  both  quiet  and  fuel  efficient.  NASA’s  Ultra-Efficient  Engine
Technology  (UEET)  program  was  a  government-industry  cooperative  effort  to  de-
velop  improved  engine  technologies.  NASA’s  Space  Act  Agreement  with  Pratt  &
Whitney  on  the  Geared  Turbo  Fan  is  a  more  recent  illustration  of  NASA’s  work  on
this challenging problem.

Concerns  about  climate  change  and  the  impact  of  the  aviation  sector  on  global
warming have spurred a variety of efforts to cut aviation emissions in the U.S. and
overseas.  Studies  have  determined  that  airlines  contribute  worldwide  up  to  three
percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Governmental and private sector organizations
have implemented efforts to reduce aviation-related emissions. In the U.S., the focus
has  been  on  continued  development  of  NextGen  and  R&D  on  engines.  While  there
is increasing understanding of the impact of carbon dioxide, the impacts from other
emissions  are  less  well  known.  The  goal  is  to  identify  the  harmful  emissions,  accu-
rately  measure  their  impact,  and  design  appropriate  technologies  or  procedures  to
mitigate  or  eliminate  their  effects.  In  Europe,  the  response  has  been  more  aggres-
sive. To cut aviation emissions, the European Union (EU) has embarked on an emis-
sion  trading  scheme  for  its  airline  industry.  This  trading  scheme  may  include  U.S.
airlines  serving  Europe  and  has  generated  controversy.  U.S.  airlines  are  reported
to  have  said  that  forced  participation  in  the  European  Union’s  carbon  trading  plan
violates  international  treaties.  The  Air  Transport  Association,  the  trade  group  for
U.S.  carriers,  is  reported  to  have  called  the  European’s  focus  on  aviation  emissions
‘‘out  of  proportion’’  and  has  noted  the  U.S.  industry’s  success  with  market  driven
approaches  such  as  buying  more  fuel-efficient  aircraft,  reducing  the  weight  of  their
planes, and investigating alternative fuels.

In October 2007, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United
Nations  body  responsible  for  regulating  the  aviation  industry,  rejected  airline  par-
ticipation  in  Europe’s  Climate  Emissions  Trading  System.  Instead,  ICAO  created  a
group of senior government officials to recommend what action the body should take
on  climate  change.  Calling  for  an  ‘‘aggressive’’  plan  of  action  from  the  new  group,
ICAO  is  reported  to  have  said  that  the  options  to  be  considered  include  voluntary
measures,  technological  advances  in  both  aircraft  and  ground-based  equipment,
more efficient operational measures, improvements in air traffic management, posi-
tive economic incentives, and market-based measures to achieve reductions in emis-
sion of greenhouse gases.

The  European  Union  is  also  focusing  its  aeronautics  R&D  on  environmental  ef-
fects. Under the aegis of its Seventh Framework Programme, the EU’s main instru-
ment  for  funding  research  over  the  period  2007  to  2013,  the  Union  will  be  con-
ducting  research  on  developing  technologies  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of
aviation with the aim of halving the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by air trans-
port,  cutting  specific  emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  by  80  percent  and  halving  per-
ceived noise. The research will address green engine technologies, alternative fuels,
novel aircraft/engine configurations, intelligent low-weight structures, improved aer-
odynamic efficiency, airport operations and air traffic management as well as manu-
facturing  and  recycling  processes.  The  ‘‘Clean  Sky’’  Joint  Technology  Initiative  will
bring together European R&D stakeholders to develop ‘green’ air vehicle design, en-
gines  and  systems  aimed  at  minimizing  the  environmental  impact  of  future  air
transport systems. This initiative establishes a Europe-wide partnership between in-
dustry, universities and research centers, with a total public/private funding of $1.6
billion.

Last  year,  to  better  understand  governmental,  industry,  and  international  efforts
to  reduce  aviation-related  emissions,  the  House  Science  and  Technology  Committee
and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee asked the Government
Accountability  Office  to  survey  those  various  initiatives,  their  potential  to  reduce
emissions,  and  the  competitive  impact  on  U.S.  airlines.  The  Committees  are  await-
ing GAO’s report.

Analyzing Safety Trends—NAOMS and ASIAS

10

Last  September,  in  a  letter  denying  a  press  request  under  the  Freedom  of  Infor-
mation  Act  for  the  data  generated  through  a  survey  of  airline  pilots  about  safety
incidents  conducted  under  the  National  Aviation  Operations  Monitoring  Service
(NAOMS),  a  NASA  official  indicated  that  the  data  would  not  be  released  because
it  is  ‘‘sensitive  and  safety-related,  [and]  could  materially  affect  the  public  confidence
in,  and  the  commercial  welfare  of,  the  air  carriers  and  general  aviation  companies
whose  pilots  participated  in  the  survey’’—a  position  subsequently  reversed  by  the
NASA Administrator. The survey was intended to be a forward-looking tool to iden-
tify  emerging  aviation  safety  problems.  Instead,  NASA  had  decided  to  stop  the
NAOMS  project—despite  the  fact  that  the  project  had  enjoyed  unusual  success  in
gathering responses from pilots.

NASA  subsequently  posted  redacted  responses  collected  from  surveys  of  general
aviation pilots and airline carrier pilots between April 2001 and December 2004 and
a  portion  of  the  actual  or  raw  survey  responses  collected  to  ‘‘show  the  breadth  and
scope  of  the  pilot  community  surveyed  and  the  types  of  aircraft  flown.’’  In  February
of  this  year,  five  Members  of  the  Committee  asked  the  Government  Accountability
Office  to  use  the  unredacted  set  of  data  collected  by  the  NAOMS  project  to  provide
the  Committee  with  an  appropriate  level  of  analysis  of  the  data  and  verification  of
the  survey  methodology.  The  Committee  is  awaiting  the  results  of  GAO’s  analysis.
The  value  of  having  another  tool  to  enhance  safety,  such  as  NAOMS,  was  dem-
onstrated  last  week.  It  was  reported  that  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  In-
spector  General  found  that  managers  at  a  Texas  facility  had  reclassified  errors  by
controllers as mistakes by pilots. The errors included instances in which controllers
allowed aircraft to get too close to one another and others in which pilots were given
improper  or  late  instructions.  FAA  officials  noted  that  none  of  the  errors  resulted
in  crashes  but  provided  no  further  details.  While  the  report  was  not  released,  the
FAA Acting Administrator characterized the report as ‘‘disturbing.’’ The availability
of  corroborative  data  from  another  source,  such  as  NAOMS,  might  have  provided
FAA with an earlier indication that the reclassifications were not warranted.

NASA  currently  is  working  with  FAA  and  the  Commercial  Aviation  Safety  Team
(a  cooperative  government-industry  initiative)  on  the  development  of  the  Aviation
Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS) system. ASIAS is intended for use
by  the  aviation  community  to  automatically  integrate  and  analyze  large  sources  of
operational  flight  data  in  order  to  detect  and  mitigate  system-wide  anomalies  or
dangerous trends before an accident occurs. If ASIAS works as planned, government
and  industry  stakeholders  will  be  able  to  query  operational  data  to  automatically
identify systemic risks, evaluate identified risks, and formulate and monitor the ef-
fectiveness  of  safety  interventions  targeted  at  identified  risks.  However,  achieving
such capabilities will not be easy. In addition to the challenge of developing and de-
livering  new  algorithms  to  automatically  detect  and  identify  vulnerabilities,  NASA
and  its  partners  will  need  to  develop  new  methods  to  automatically  integrate  and
process large sources of disparate data.

Chairman  UDALL.  Good  morning.  I  would  like  to  welcome  our
witnesses to today’s hearing, and thank you for your participation.
Today  the  Subcommittee  continues  our  oversight  of  NASA’s
major programs by focusing on aeronautics. It is important that we
do  so  because  in  many  ways,  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  is  one
important  answer  to  the  question  of  what  it  is  that  makes  NASA
relevant to the Nation’s needs.

At the same time, it has become painfully clear that NASA’s aer-
onautics  program  has  been  significantly  shortchanged  in  recent
years  when  it  comes  to  getting  the  resources  required  to  address
those  national  needs.  That  is  unacceptable  as  far  as  I  am  con-
cerned. NASA has many worthwhile programs underway, activities
that certainly deserve our support. Yet I am hard-pressed to think
of any program at NASA, with the possible exception of NASA’s cli-
mate  research  initiatives,  that  is  more  relevant  to  our  society’s
needs than NASA’s aeronautics program.

Aviation  knits  our  country  together,  maintains  our  economic  vi-
tality,  improves  the  quality  of  our  lives  and  helps  enhance  our  na-
tional security. Moreover, aviation is a sector that makes a signifi-
cant positive contribution to our balance of our trade and promotes
America’s competitiveness in the global economy.

Yet the explosive growth of aviation over the last several decades
has  brought  its  own  set  of  challenges.  These  include  dealing  with
the increasing congestion of the Nation’s airspace system, the need
to maintain safety in the face of increasing travel demand and the
need  to  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  of  aviation  on  the  environ-
ment,  whether  noise,  increasing  energy  consumption  or  harmful
emissions.

Now, with respect to emissions, it is clear that an emerging focus
of  concern  is  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  can  contribute  to  cli-
mate  change,  an  area  that  this  committee  has  been  trying  to  call
attention  to  over  the  past  year.  It  is  clear  that  meeting  all  those
challenges  is  going  to  require  a  national  commitment  to  cutting-
edge research into new technologies and operational procedures.

We must focus on research that will ensure that the Nation’s air
traffic  management  system  will  be  able  to  meet  anticipated  de-
mand  while  preserving  safety  and  making  the  whole  experience  a
lot  more  pleasant  than  it  is  now  for  the  average  traveler.  We  also
need  to  focus  on  developing  technologies  that  make  aircraft  much
more  energy  efficient  and  produce  lower  levels  of  harmful  emis-
sions.

In addition, NASA needs to continue to pursue research that will
open  up  new  flight  regimes  for  our  utilization,  for  example,  re-
search  that  will  enable  such  things  as  civil  rotorcraft  and  super-
sonic  aircraft  that  are  environmentally  friendly,  safe  and  that  can
operate  without  adverse  impacts  on  our  communities.  We  need  to
focus on research that will ensure that we maintain the high level
of safety that we have enjoyed in our aviation sector.

Indeed,  the  National  Academies  completed  a  Decadal  Survey  of
Civil  Aeronautics  several  years  ago  that  identified  some  51  key
technical  challenges  around  which  NASA,  in  close  collaboration
with industry and academia, could structure a compelling and pro-
ductive  aeronautics  R&D  agenda  for  the  next  decade.  That  is  the
good news.

However,  as  a  number  of  witnesses  at  today’s  hearing  will  tes-
tify,  and  as  past  witnesses  have  also  testified,  the  decline  in
NASA’s  aeronautics  funding  is  making  it  increasingly  difficult  to
maintain  an  aeronautics  research  program  that  will  be  capable  of
stepping  up  to  the  challenges  the  Nation’s  aviation  sector  will  be
facing in the coming decades.

In  short,  the  future  relevance  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  is
at  risk,  just  when  the  need  for  NASA’S  research  contributions  is
greatest. In part, that is because carrying research to a level of ma-
turity  that  allows  the  results  to  be  transitioned  to  the  users,
whether in the public or the private sector, requires a greater level
of  investment  than  the  current  Administration  has  been  willing  to
make.  That  needs  to  change.  If  promising  technologies  and  oper-
ational  concepts  aren’t  matured  to  the  point  that  they  can  be
transitioned to the users for future development or implementation,
the Nation will never receive the full benefit of the investment that
is made in that research. That is the challenge we face.

Aeronautics  needs  to  be  a  priority  at  NASA.  It  is  as  simple  as
that.  I  think  the  NASA  Reauthorization  Act  of  2005  got  it  right
when  it  reaffirmed  that  ‘‘Aeronautics  research  remains  a  core  mis-
sion of NASA.’’

Our  witnesses  today  will  tell  us  about  the  ways  that  NASA  re-
search  can  contribute  to  a  bright  and  exciting  future  for  American
aviation. We need to ensure that NASA maintains its commitment
to  carrying  out  that  research,  and  we  have  a  lot  to  discuss  at  to-
day’s  hearing  so  at  this  point  I  will  again  thank  our  witnesses  for
your  participation,  and  we  very  much  look  forward  to  your  testi-
mony.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Udall follows:]

focusing on Aeronautics.

It is important that we do so, because in many ways NASA’s aeronautics program
is  one  important  answer  to  the  question  of  what  it  is  that  makes  NASA  relevant
to the Nation’s needs.

At the same time, it has become painfully clear that NASA’s aeronautics program

sources required to address those national needs.

That’s  unacceptable  as  far  as  I  am  concerned.  NASA  has  many  worthwhile  pro-

Yet I am hard-pressed to think of any program at NASA, with the possible excep-
tion  of  NASA’s  climate  research  initiatives,  that  is  more  relevant  to  our  society’s
needs than NASA’s aeronautics program.

Aviation knits our country together, maintains our economic vitality, improves the

quality of our lives, and helps enhance our national security.

Moreover, aviation is a sector that makes a significant positive contribution to our

balance of trade—and promotes America’s competitiveness in the global economy.

Yet the explosive growth of aviation over the last several decades has also brought

its own set of challenges.

These include dealing with the increasing congestion of the Nation’s airspace sys-
tem,  the  need  to  maintain  safety  in  the  face  of  increasing  travel  demand,  and  the
need  to  mitigate  the  negative  impacts  of  aviation  on  the  environment—whether
noise, increasing energy consumption, or harmful emissions.

And  with  respect  to  emissions,  it  is  clear  that  an  emerging  focus  of  concern  is

committee has been trying to call attention to over the past year.

It is clear that meeting all of those challenges is going to require a national com-
mitment to cutting-edge research into new technologies and operational procedures.
We  must  focus  on  research  that  will  ensure  that  the  Nation’s  air  traffic  manage-
ment  system  will  be  able  to  meet  anticipated  demand  while  preserving  safety  and
making  the  whole  experience  a  lot  more  pleasant  than  it  is  now  for  the  average
traveler.

We  also  need  to  focus  on  developing  technologies  that  can  make  aircraft  much

more energy efficient and produce lower levels of harmful emissions.

In  addition,  NASA  needs  to  continue  to  pursue  research  that  will  open  up  new
flight regimes for our utilization, for example, research that will enable such things
as  civil  rotorcraft  and  supersonic  aircraft  that  are  environmentally  friendly,  safe,
and that can operate without adverse impacts on our communities.

And we need to focus on research that will ensure that we maintain the high level

of safety that we have enjoyed in our aviation sector.

Indeed, the National Academies completed a Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics
several  years  ago  that  identified  some  51  key  technical  challenges  around  which
NASA—in  close  collaboration  with  industry  and  academia—could  structure  a  com-
pelling and productive aeronautics R&D agenda for the next decade.

That’s the good news.
However, as a number of the witnesses at today’s hearing will testify, and as past
witnesses have also testified—the decline in NASA’s aeronautics funding is making
it increasingly difficult to maintain an aeronautics research program that will be ca-
pable  of  stepping  up  to  the  challenges  the  Nation’s  aviation  sector  will  be  facing  in
the coming decades.

In  short,  the  future  relevance  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  is  at  risk—just

when the need for NASA’s research contributions is greatest.

In  part  that  is  because  carrying  research  to  a  level  of  maturity  that  allows  the
results  to  be  transitioned  to  the  users—whether  private  or  public  sector—requires
a  greater  level  of  investment  than  the  current  Administration  has  been  willing  to
make.

That needs to change.
If  promising  technologies  and  operational  concepts  aren’t  matured  to  the  point
that  they  can  be  transitioned  to  the  users  for  further  development  or  implementa-
tion,  the  Nation  will  never  receive  the  full  benefit  of  the  investment  that  it  has
made in that research.

That’s the challenge we face.
Aeronautics needs to be a priority at NASA. It is as simple as that.
I  think  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  got  it  right  when  it  reaffirmed  that

‘‘Aeronautics research remains a core mission of NASA.’’

Our  witnesses  today  will  tell  us  about  the  ways  that  NASA  research  can  con-

tribute to a bright and exciting future for American aviation.

We need to ensure that NASA maintains its commitment to carrying out that re-

We  have  much  to  discuss  at  today’s  hearing,  so  at  this  point  I  will  again  thank

our witnesses for your participation, and we look forward to your testimony.

Chairman  UDALL.  It  is  with  great  pleasure  I  now  recognize  the
Ranking  Member,  my  partner,  Mr.  Feeney,  for  an  opening  state-
ment.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Udall,  for  calling  today’s
hearing  and  thanks  also  to  our  witnesses  for  taking  time  away
from  their  busy  schedules  to  come  before  us  today.  I  realize  most
of  you  have  traveled  some  distance,  carving  at  least  a  day,  if  not
two,  out  of  your  week  to  be  here  with  us  and  I  appreciate  that.
Your wisdom and expertise are greatly appreciated.

Mr.  Chairman,  there  are  very  few  enterprises  over  the  past  100
years  that  have  contributed  so  powerfully  to  America’s  economy
and  enhanced  our  nation’s  quality  of  life  and  our  security  than
NASA’s aeronautics research and development program. It actually
began  some  93  years  ago  with  the  establishment  of  the  National
Advisory  Committee  for  Aeronautics  in  1915.  Even  though  the
Wright  Brothers  had  conducted  their  first  powered  flight  in  1903,
by  the  beginning  of  World  War  I,  the  United  States  lagged  behind

Europe  in  airplane  technology.  In  order  to  catch  up,  Congress
founded NACA.

NACA  involved  into  a  splendid  organization  that  produced  gems
of  aeronautical  research.  In  1958,  NACA  was  folded  into  NASA
when  the  latter  was  created  in  response  to  the  Sputnik  mission.
Exemplary  aeronautical  research  continued.  And  the  Space  Task
Force,  which  drew  from  the  talented  base  at  NACA’s  Langley  Me-
morial  Aeronautical  Laboratory,  began  America’s  human  space
flight program, Project Mercury.

The  discoveries  and  applications  that  have  flowed  from  NACA
and NASA have spurred a large and vibrant aerospace industry. As
should  be  expected,  this  industry  and  aerospace  technology  has
evolved over time, especially over the last three decades. Since the
late 1970s, the airline industry has been deregulated. Manufactur-
ers  and  carriers  have  been  consolidated.  The  airspace  has  become
saturated. Building new runways and airports has become very dif-
ficult  and  very  expensive.  The  size  and  performance  of  aircraft  op-
erating  in  the  system  are  much  more  diverse  and  environmental
performance  and  efficiency  are  driving  designs  of  the  next  genera-
tion of aircraft. The list of changes goes on.

In  the  face  of  these  changes,  it  is  fair  to  ask  how  healthy  and
relevant is NASA’s aeronautics program today. Is it appropriate for
the  Federal  Government  to  continue  to  fund  aeronautics  research,
and if so, where should the line be drawn between government and
industry  research  responsibilities?  Are  NASA’s  aeronautics  re-
searchers  pursuing  the  right  questions?  Is  the  Agency  making  the
most effective use of research funding? Are the Agency’s discoveries
and products being adopted by industry?

Adding  further  complexity  to  the  discussion  is  the  NextGen  pro-
gram,  of  which  NASA  is  a  critical  partner.  Unlike  the  mixed  re-
sults  from  past  efforts  to  modernize  the  air  traffic  control  system,
NextGen must succeed. There is no alternative. In the increasingly
competitive  global  economy,  America’s  advantages  in  mobility  and
logistics cannot be frittered away.

And  in  an  era  of  increased  emphasis  on  energy  and  environ-
mental concerns, I gently point out that NextGen’s efficiencies will
produce  energy  savings  and  a  lessened  environmental  footprint  as
aircraft  use  more  direct  routes,  experience  less  air  and  ground
holds  and  employ  techniques  like  Continuous  Descent  Approach.
Improved  mobility  is  environmentally  friendly  and  economically
beneficial.

But  if  NextGen  is  to  succeed,  NASA  must  develop  and  validate
technologies  to  enable  more  efficient,  environmentally  benign  and
safer  aircraft  and  engines  as  well  as  surveillance,  navigation  and
control infrastructure.

I am hoping the testimony we will receive this morning will help
us  reach  a  broad  consensus  on  how  to  shape  the  program  to  meet
current  and  future  challenges.  I  am  especially  anxious  to  hear  the
views  of  industry  and  from  the  National  Research  Council  about
their  findings  and  recommendations  contained  in  their  recently
published analysis of NASA’s aeronautics programs. I also want to
congratulate  Dr.  Shin,  a  longtime  NASA  aeronautics  researcher,
who was recently appointed to head the Agency’s aeronautics direc-
torate.

Aeronautics  is  not  a  mature  industry.  Any  number  of  new  tech-
nologies  that  enable  cleaner,  quieter,  more  efficient  aircraft  will
make  a  telling  difference  between  success  and  failure.  We  cannot
afford to cede our leadership to foreign suppliers.

With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  again  thank  you  for  the  hearing  and

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE TOM FEENEY

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this morning’s hearing. And my thanks, too,
to  our  witnesses  for  taking  time  away  from  their  busy  schedules  to  appear  before
us today. I realize most of you have traveled some distance, carving at least a day—
if not two—out of your work week to be here. Your wisdom and expertise are greatly
appreciated.

Mr.  Chairman,  there  are  very  few  federal  enterprises  over  the  past  one  hundred
years  that  have  contributed  so  powerfully  to  America’s  economy  and  enhanced  our
nation’s quality of life—and our security—than NASA’s aeronautics research and de-
velopment  program.  It  began  93  years  ago  with  the  establishment  of  the  National
Advisory  Committee  for  Aeronautics  (NACA)  in  1915.  Even  though  the  Wright
brothers conducted the first powered flight in 1903, by the beginning of World War
I, the United States lagged behind Europe in airplane technology. In order to catch
up, Congress founded NACA.

try  has  been  deregulated;  manufacturers  and  carriers  have  consolidated;  the  air-
space  has  become  saturated;  building  new  runways  and  airports  has  become  very
difficult and expensive; the size and performance of aircraft operating in the system
are  much  more  diverse;  and  environmental  performance  and  efficiency  are  driving

researchers  pursuing  the  right  questions?  Is  the  Agency  making  the  most  effective

is a critical partner. Unlike the mixed results from past efforts to modernize the air

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  for  calling  this  hearing  on  NASA’s  Aeronautics  R&D
programs.  As  Chairman  of  the  Aviation  Subcommittee,  I  am  extremely  interested
in  these  programs  because  NASA  and  FAA  coordinate  research  for  implementation
of NextGen. Further, these programs also lead to further reductions in aviation’s en-
vironmental  impact.  Our  Aviation  Subcommittee  is  having  a  hearing  on  aviation
and the environment next week where we will delve further into aviation’s environ-
mental impacts, but I want to be clear that aeronautics R&D is a significant compo-
nent in assisting the industry in its efforts to reduce aviation emissions.

A  strong  aerospace  industry  will  enable  the  United  States  to  defend  itself,  com-
pete in the global marketplace, maintain a highly skilled workforce, and provide all
Americans with the ability to travel safely and securely anywhere in the world. Con-
tinued  reductions  in  the  NASA  aeronautics  budgets  delay  our  ability  to  meet  the
goals  of  NextGen,  which  is  expected  to  reduce  congestion  and  delays  in  our  skies
and produce great efficiencies in our aviation system.

I  continue  to  be  troubled  that  the  Bush  Administration  sees  NextGen  as  the  an-
swers  to  our  congestion  in  the  skies,  but  does  not  budget  accordingly  to  reach  that
goal. R&D is essential to advancing NextGen and we cannot lose sight of that.

I welcome our witnesses and look forward to their testimony.
Chairman  UDALL.  I  would  like  to  move  right  to  an  introduction
of  our  panel  of  witnesses.  First  up,  we  have  Dr.  Jaiwon  Shin,  who
is  the  new  Associate  Administrator  at  NASA  for  the  Aeronautics
Research  Mission  Directorate.  Congratulations  on  your  new  ap-
pointment.  Next  to  Dr.  Shin,  we  have  Mr.  Carl  Meade,  who  is  ap-
pearing  today  as  the  Co-Chair  of  the  National  Research  Council’s
Committee  for  the  Assessment  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research
Program.  Welcome  to  you.  Mr.  Preston  Henne  is  the  Senior  Vice
President  for  Programs,  Engineering  and  Testing  for  Gulfstream
Aerospace  Corporation.  We  are  looking  forward  to  your  testimony.
There  are  some  exciting  things  going  on  at  Gulfstream.  And  then
finally  we  have  Dr.  Ilan  Kroo,  who  is  Professor  in  the  Department
of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics  at  Stanford  University.  Welcome.
I think you all know that spoken testimony is limited to five min-
utes each, after which the Members of the Subcommittee will have
five  minutes  each  to  ask  questions.  Dr.  Shin,  we  will  start  with
you.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  JAIWON  SHIN,  ASSOCIATE  ADMINIS-
TRATOR, AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE,
NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE  ADMINISTRATION
(NASA)
Dr.  SHIN.  Chairman  Udall,  Ranking  Member  Feeney,  thank  you
for  this  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  provide  an  up-
date  on  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  program.  I  will  also  address
the  issues  raised  by  the  Subcommittee  concerning  the  R&D  chal-
lenges  in  aeronautics,  specifically  the  Next  Generation  Air  Trans-
portation  System,  or  NextGen,  aviation  safety,  aviation  environ-
mental impacts and promising new flight regimes.

As  you  know,  NASA  has  a  long  and  successful  history  of  con-
ducting R&D in technologies that have benefited our nation’s avia-
tion community. One such example is the vertical extensions found

on  wingtips,  which  help  to  improve  an  aircraft’s  full  efficiency  and
cruising range, known as winglets——

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Shin, would you pull the microphone a lit-
tle  closer?  We  just  want  to  make  sure  we  get  your  words  in  the
record. Thank you.

Dr.  SHIN.  Known  as  winglets,  this  technology  was  developed  by
NASA  during  the  1970s  and  is  now  found  on  aircraft  of  all  types
around the world. You should have before you a folder that depicts
some examples of NASA innovation that have made a difference in
the way we safely travel today. NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mis-
sion  Directorate,  or  ARMD,  continues  this  tradition  through  its
commitment  to  conducting  long-term  cutting-edge  research  for  the
benefit  of  the  broad  aeronautics  community  and  in  support  of
NASA’s goals for both manned and robotic space exploration.

I believe that aviation in the United States could be on the verge
of another renaissance. Demand for air travel is expected to double
or even triple in the next two decades, which will require a revolu-
tionary air transportation system. In order to realize this new sys-
tem,  a  number  of  significant  challenges  must  be  overcome  such  as
protecting  the  environment,  ensuring  safety,  dramatically  improv-
ing  efficiency  and  revolutionizing  the  ways  we  manage  the  flow  of
aircraft.  The  aeronautics  research  that  we  conduct  today  will  play
a vital role in transforming the air transportation system of tomor-
row.

While each of the four programs within ARMD uniquely address
critical  challenges,  the  four  programs  integrate  their  research  for
a  holistic  approach  to  high-level  challenges  such  as  NextGen.  I
would  like  to  illustrate  why  this  holistic  approach  is  important  by
going over the four questions raised by the Committee.

As for the NextGen R&D issues, I must say that it is difficult to
identify  the  most  critical  barrier  to  NextGen.  While  it  is  easy  to
consider  the  air  traffic  management  system  to  be  the  most  critical
issue,  the  reality  is,  we  must  treat  the  entire  system  as  an  inter-
related  enterprise  instead  of  segregating  research  into  separate
areas.  To  foster  this  thinking,  ARMD’s  research  programs  address
issues of air traffic management, avionics advanced vehicles, safety
and  environmental  impact.  The  vast  majority  of  what  ARMD  does
is directly in line with the NextGen vision that is clearly supported
by national aeronautics R&D policy.

It  is  a  well-known  fact  that  the  current  U.S.  air  transportation
system  is  among  the  safest  modes  of  transportation  ever.  Even  as
we  dramatically  transform  our  air  transportation  system,  it  is  im-
perative that we maintain or preferably improve on this impressive
safety  record.  ARMD’s  Aviation  Safety  Program  is  working  on  de-
velopment  of  new  technologies  such  as  new  airborne  sensors  of
flight  hazards,  methods  of  controlling  aircraft  even  in  upset  condi-
tions  and  systems  capable  of  monitoring  aircraft  and  airspace  to
detect  anomalies  before  they  can  develop  into  accidents.  Likewise,
the  Aviation  Safety  Program  is  developing  new  materials  and
structures  that  can  age  with  great  durability  and  less  fatigue  and
is  establishing  a  research  program  in  human  system  integration
and NextGen operations.

I  should  point  out  that  as  the  number  of  flight  operations  at
many of the largest airports in the Nation continues to grow, envi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:39 Oct 11, 2008 Jkt 041902 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\050108\41902 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

18

ronmental concerns over noise and emissions will limit the capacity
of  those  airports  and  therefore  limit  the  capacity  of  the  entire  sys-
tem.  NASA’s  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  is  working  to  im-
prove  the  environmental  impact  of  aviation  through  green  aircraft
research  initiatives  to  reduce  noise,  local  and  global  emissions  and
local air quality. We are also working on advanced vehicle concepts
that will satisfy both forecasted demand and environmental compli-
ance. Furthermore, the Aviation Systems Program is ensuring that
today’s fleet and new generations of vehicles can operate within the
NextGen  in  a  matter  minimizing  aviation’s  environmental  impact.
NASA  is  not  fixated  on  developing  new  capability  in  just  one
flight  regime,  and  I  believe  that  an  ideal  situation  will  exist  when
multiple  vehicle  types  exist,  each  suited  for  a  particular  use,  oper-
ating in an air transportation system that is flexible enough to ac-
commodate  a  wide  range  of  vehicles  without  limiting  performance.
Examples of some of the most promising concepts include advanced
subsonic  transonic  transport  with  nearly  half  the  fuel  burn  of  to-
day’s  vehicles  and  a  noise  footprint  that  can  be  confined  to  the
boundary  of  the  airport,  advanced  supersonic  transports  with  low
sonic  boom  characteristics  so  that  the  aircraft  may  be  flown
supersonically over land and advanced rotorcraft that allow vertical
or  short  takeoff  and  landing  with  vastly  improved  range  and  per-
formance and reduced environmental impact, mainly from noise.

I  am  pleased  to  report  to  you  that  NASA  aeronautics  now  is  in
full  execution  of  a  robust  fundamental  research  program  that  is
well aligned with the national aeronautics R&D policy and directly
supports the development of the NextGen system. ARMD’s commit-
ment to technical excellent with strong partnerships with industry,
academia  and  other  government  agencies  will  ensure  our  reputa-
tion as the world’s premier aeronautics R&D organization.

I welcome any questions you may have. Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JAIWON SHIN

Chairman  Udall  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  this  oppor-
tunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  provide  an  update  on  NASA’s  aeronautics  re-
search  program  and  to  address  the  issues  raised  by  the  Subcommittee  concerning
the  R&D  challenges  in  aeronautics;  specifically,  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transpor-
tation  System  (NextGen),  promising  new  flight  regimes,  aviation  safety,  and  avia-
tion environmental impacts.

NASA  has  a  long  and  successful  history  of  conducting  research  and  development
(R&D)  in  technologies  that  have  benefited  our  nation’s  aviation  community.  Today,
NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  (ARMD)  continues  this  tradition
through its commitment to conducting long-term, cutting-edge research for the ben-
efit of the broad aeronautics community. ARMD has put together a robust research
portfolio  that  addresses  the  challenges  facing  our  nation  as  it  transforms  its  air
transportation  system  to  meet  growing  capacity  needs.  Furthermore,  the  portfolio
ensures aeronautics research and critical core competencies continue to play a vital
role in support of NASA’s goals for both manned and robotic space exploration.

Growth  in  the  air  transportation  system  is  vital  to  the  well  being  of  our  nation.
In  order  to  realize  the  revolutionary  changes  required  to  meet  forecasted  capacity
increases,  a  number  of  significant  challenges  must  be  overcome  such  as  protecting
the environment, ensuring safety, dramatically improving efficiency and revolution-
izing  the  ways  we  manage  the  flow  of  aircraft.  In  the  next  two  decades  we  must
find  ways  to  make  advances  that  improve  aircraft  and  system  efficiency,  reduce
aviation’s  impact  on  the  environment  and  allow  more  people  to  utilize  air  travel  in
ways  that  are  more  significant  than  all  the  gains  realized  over  the  last  three  dec-
ades.  The  research  ARMD  conducts  today  to  address  these  issues  will  play  a  vital
role in transforming the air transportation system of tomorrow.

ARMD Principles

Every  successful  organization  can  point  to  core  principles  that  guide  its  strategic
direction.  Since  the  restructuring  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  in  2006,  ARMD
has  been  guided  by  three  such  core  principles:  1)  we  will  dedicate  ourselves  to  the
mastery and intellectual stewardship of the core competencies of aeronautics for the
Nation  in  all  flight  regimes;  2)  we  will  focus  our  research  in  areas  that  are  appro-
priate  to  NASA’s  unique  capabilities;  and,  3)  we  will  directly  address  the  funda-
mental  research  needs  of  the  NextGen  while  working  closely  with  our  agency  part-
ners  in  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office  (JPDO).  While  the  leadership
of ARMD has changed, these principles remain core to our strategic decision-making
process  and  help  to  guide  the  direction  of  all  of  our  programs.  These  principles  en-
sure  that  NASA  is  focused  on  the  most  appropriate  cutting-edge  research  to  over-
come a wide range of aeronautics challenges facing our nation’s future air transpor-
tation  system  and  space  exploration  missions.  Lastly,  these  principles  have  helped
ARMD  structure  a  robust  aeronautics  program  that  is  well  aligned  with  the  prin-
ciples, goals and objectives of the recent National Aeronautics R&D Policy and Plan.

Program Descriptions

Four  programs  have  been  established  under  ARMD  using  our  guiding  principles:
the  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program,  the  Aviation  Safety  Program,  the  Airspace
Systems. Program and the Aeronautics Test Program. While each program uniquely
addresses critical challenges, the four programs integrate their research for a holis-
tic  approach  to  high  level  challenges  such  as  NextGen.  The  following  are  brief  de-
scriptions  of  each  program  and  how  their  research  supports  the  broad  aeronautic
community.

ARMD’s  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  (FAP)  pursues  long-term,  cutting-
edge  research  in  all  flight  regimes  (from  subsonic  to  hypersonic)  to  produce  data,
knowledge FAP, and design tools that will be applicable across a broad range of air
vehicles.  FAT  focuses  on  creating  innovative  solutions  for  the  technical  challenges
of  the  future  which  include  1)  increasing  performance  (including  fuel  efficiency,
range, speed, payload, take-off and landing distances) while meeting stringent noise
and  emissions  constraints;  2)  alleviating  environmental  and  congestion/capacity
problems  through  the  use  of  new  aircraft  and  rotorcraft  concepts;  3)  improving  the
speed  of  air  transportation  while  maintaining  strict  standards  for  performance  and
environmental compatibility; and 4) facilitating access to space and re-entry through
planetary  atmospheres.  FAP  research  will  directly  support  the  NextGen  challenges
of overcoming the environmental and performance barriers to projected increases in
capacity. Research in new aircraft and rotorcraft concepts will also directly support
NextGen goals of better utilization of the airspace.

ARMD’s Aviation Safety Program (AvSP) builds upon NASA’s unique research ca-
pabilities to improve aircraft safety, and to overcome safety limits that would other-
wise constrain the full realization of the NextGen system. To meet these safety chal-
lenges,  AvSP  focuses  on  developing  cutting-edge  technologies  to  improve  the  intrin-
sic  safety  attributes  of  current  and  future  aircraft  and  also  on  exploring  how
NextGen  operations  can  improve  upon  the  existing  remarkable  safety  record  of  our
current air transportation system. Examples of new technologies with direct applica-
tion to NextGen include new sensors and methods to automatically detect and iden-
tify  flight  hazards,  hidden  anomalies  or  trends  in  aircraft  systems,  advanced  mate-
rials,  and  flight  control  systems  resilient  in  the  face  of  failure  and  adverse  flight
conditions such as weather.

ARMD’s  Airspace  Systems  Program  (ASP)  enables  the  development  of  revolu-
tionary improvements to the national airspace system that allow sufficient capacity
to  meet  increasing  demand  for  air  travel.  ASP  focuses  on  research  to  incorporate
intelligent automation into the system with balanced roles for people and computers
while  preserving  the  high  safety  standard.  Included  in  this  is  the  development  of
automated aircraft trajectories that are safe, efficient and robust under a wide vari-
ety  of  traffic  conditions.  Solutions  for  enabling  greater  capacity  at  the  busiest  air-
ports and in dense airspace integrate uncertainties, such as weather, into air traffic
management  decisions.  The  end  result  of  ASP  research  is  more  efficient  operations
and reduced flight delays.

ARMD’s  Aeronautics  Test  Program  (ATP)  focuses  on  the  support  of  both  ground
based  facilities,  such  as  wind  tunnels  and  aero-propulsion  test  facilities,  as  well  as
the  aircraft  and  flight  test  infrastructure.  ATP  makes  strategic  utilization,  oper-
ations,  maintenance,  and  investment  decisions  for  major  wind  tunnels/ground  test
facilities  at  Ames  Research  Center  in  California,  Glenn  Research  Center  in  Ohio,
and  Langley  Research  Center  in  Virginia,  and  supports  selected  mission  support
and test bed aircraft at Dryden Flight Research Center, also in California. ATP en-

sures  the  availability  of  world-class  aeronautics  test  facilities  and  test  aircraft  for
the benefit of the aeronautics community.

Addressing NextGen R&D Issues

Aviation  in  the  United  States  is  facing  an  exciting  possibility  for  being  on  the
verge  of  another  renaissance.  Demand  for  air  travel  is  expected  to  double  or  even
triple  in  the  next  two  decades,  which  will  require  a  revolutionary  new  air  traffic
management  system.  New  technologies  and  design  capabilities  are  making  it  pos-
sible  to  create  entirely  new  vehicles  that  look  radically  different  from  the  familiar
‘‘tube-and-wing’’  aircraft  that  are  now  so  familiar.  These  new  aircraft  will  bring  re-
markable  new  capabilities  that  may  require  entirely  new  operational  procedures  in
the airspace. Aeronautics research is crucial to overcoming the numerous challenges
that  impede  the  growth  of  air  travel.  In  addition,  there  is  an  inherent  challenge  of
improving safety even as we increase capacity. NASA is focused on addressing these
critical long-term challenges.

It  is  difficult  to  identify  the  ‘‘most  critical’’  barrier  to  NextGen.  Thus,  one  clear
focus  for  NASA  is  treating  the  entire  system  as  an  inter-related  enterprise,  mir-
roring  the  National  Aeronautics  R&D  Policy,  instead  of  segregating  research  into
separate  areas.  Alignment  with  the  National  Aeronautics  R&D  Policy  helps  ensure
that NASA is focused on the most important R&D issues.

NASA understands that the NextGen concept involves much more than just revo-
lutionizing the air traffic management system; it also includes the advanced aircraft
concepts that will populate the system over the next several decades. In particular,
NASA  is  focusing  on  three  generations  of  vehicles  beyond  the  current  generation,
‘‘N,’’  represented  by  the  Boeing  787  for  the  fixed  wing  subsonic  class  of  aircraft.
Generation ‘‘N+1’’ is presumed to enter into service in 2015, market permitting, and
is envisioned to be a tube-and-wing configuration but equipped with more advanced
technologies  than  Generation  ‘‘N’’  aircraft.  Generation  ‘‘N+2’’  will  employ  revolu-
tionary  concepts  to  achieve  simultaneous  gains  in  fuel  burn,  noise,  and  emissions,
with  an  Initial  Operating  Concept  around  2020.  Generation  ‘‘N+3’’  will  follow  with
much improved performance and reduced environmental impact.

We must ensure that the airspace in which these aircraft will operate allows them
to  make  full  use  of  their  capabilities.  Simultaneously,  we  must  also  ensure  that
safety  is  not  compromised.  Our  system-wide  view  of  the  entire  air  transportation
system  is  reflected  in  the  recent  cross-Program  NASA  Research  Announcement
(NRA) topic entitled: ‘‘Integration of Advanced Concepts and Vehicles into the Next
Generation Air Transportation System.’’

To  foster  this  thinking,  ARMD’s  three  research  programs  address  issues  of  Air
Traffic  Management  (ATM),  avionics,  advanced  vehicles,  safety,  and  environmental
impact. The vast majority of what ARMD does is directly aligned with the NextGen
vision  that  is  clearly  supported  by  the  National  Aeronautics  R&D  Policy.  The  fol-
lowing examples illustrate the alignment of ARMD programs with the National Aer-
onautics R&D Policy and the NextGen vision:

• The  Airspace  Systems  Program  directly  addresses  the  Policy’s  first  principle
of  ‘‘mobility  through  the  air’’  by  conducting  air  traffic  management  research
that will develop concepts, capabilities, and technologies required to meet the
Nation’s anticipated growth in airspace operations, both in the air and on the
ground.  The  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  directly  addresses  this  prin-
ciple by conducting research that can enable the development of advanced air-
craft  systems  that  fly  with  higher  performance,  lower  fuel  consumption,  and
minimum  environmental  impact  (noise  and  emissions)  at  a  range  of  speeds
and from a wide variety of airports.

• The  core  mission  of  the  Aviation  Safety  Program  directly  addresses  the  Pol-

icy’s third principle that states that aviation safety is paramount.

• The Fundamental Aeronautics Program simultaneously addresses the Policy’s
sixth  principle  of  ‘‘assuring  energy  availability  and  efficiency’’  and  seventh
principle  of  ‘‘protecting  the  environment’’  by  conducting  research  to  improve
aircraft performance, increase fuel efficiency, evaluate alternative fuels, lower
emissions  (including  particulate  matter)  and  reduce  noise.  In  addition,  the
Airspace  Systems  Program  also  addresses  these  two  principles  by  conducting
research to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact through bet-
ter utilization of the airspace.

Additional examples of specific challenges and the NASA strategy to address them

are provided in the following sections.

Safety Issues Facing the Nation

21

The current U.S. air transportation system is among the safest modes of transpor-
tation  ever.  Throughout  the  implementation  of  NextGen  it  is  imperative  that  we
maintain  or  preferably  improve  on  this  impressive  safety  record.  However,  there  is
no  single  safety  issue  upon  which  to  focus  our  efforts.  Instead,  we  need  to  contin-
ually analyze for and predict safety issues as NextGen is implemented.

We  do  know  that  there  are  many  complex  aspects  of  NextGen  that  present  re-
search  challenges  accepted  by  all  ARMD  research  programs.  For  example,  a  major
challenge  will  be  the  proper  design,  integration,  and  use  of  automation  in  both
ground-based and airborne systems. Meeting this challenge will require advances in
human-machine  integration  capabilities,  better  decision-making  through  data  and
knowledge  mining  systems,  and  intelligent  systems  that  adapt  to  failures  and  haz-
ardous  flight  conditions.  Another  challenge  is  the  need  for  improved  software
verification and validation techniques to prevent against anomalies that could prop-
agate  across  highly  integrated  systems  with  unintended  consequences.  In  addition,
new  aircraft  create  challenges  for  effective  maintenance  and  continued  airworthi-
ness  assurance  of  advanced  materials  and  lightweight  structures  when  exposed  to
typical operational hazards and aging effects.

Consequently,  NASA’s  Aviation  Safety  Program  conducts  fundamental  research
across  its  four  project  areas  to  address  both  established  and  emerging  safety  bar-
riers  to  the  full  realization  of  NextGen.  For  example,  one  aspect  of  the  research
portfolio  is  investigating  human-machine  integration  issues  to  include  the  best  use
of  automation.  We  also  know  that  a  myriad  of  new  aircraft  materials  will  be  used,
so NASA is working to predict the long-term aging effects to understand the funda-
mental characteristics of advanced materials and aircraft structures, with the intent
to design and mitigate against aging related hazards. NASA is also looking at miti-
gating unknown issues that may develop iii flight by designing intelligent on-board
systems that can respond to and reliably mitigate against failures and flight in ad-
verse  conditions  such  as  icing.  Finally,  NASA  is  also  researching  new  data  mining
techniques to predict future failures from trends in current operations. This involves
a fundamental shift away from a forensic approach of trying to understand why an
accident  occurred  to  a  prognostic  approach  to  safety  that  allows  unsafe  conditions
to  be  identified  before  they  become  tragic.  NASA  continues  to  work  with  the  Com-
mercial Aviation Safety Team and other stakeholders to identify current and emerg-
ing aviation safety issues.

The Impact of Aviation on the Environment

As  NextGen  evolves  to  meet  the  projected  growth  in  demand  for  air  transpor-
tation,  NASA’s  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  is  working  to  answer  two  major
questions:  (1)  how  will  we  continue  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  aviation
(in terms of noise, local and global emissions, and local air quality) despite growth?
and,  (2)  what  kinds  of  advanced  vehicles  will  be  required  to  satisfy  both  forecasted
demand  and  environmental  compliance?  Furthermore,  the  Airspace  Systems  Pro-
gram  is  ensuring  that  today’s  fleet  and  new  generations  of  vehicles  can  operate
within the NextGen in a manner minimizing aviation’s environmental impact. These
efforts  represent  significant  investments  in  ‘‘green’’  aircraft  research  initiatives
being led by NASA ARMD.

As  the  number  of  flight  operations  at  many  of  the  largest  airports  in  the  Nation
continues  to  increase,  environmental  concerns  over  noise  and  emissions  will  limit
the capacity of those airports, and therefore limit the capacity of the entire system.
Concerns over global emissions (mostly over greenhouse gases) may radically change
air transportation as we know it: without new and innovative aircraft concepts and
air  traffic  management  concepts  that  can  provide  unprecedented  levels  of  perform-
ance  and  environmental  compliance,  the  overall  capacity  of  the  system  will  be  sig-
nificantly  hampered.  By  2025,  the  demand  for  air  transportation  will  be  satisfied
by  a  variety  of  classes  of  aircraft.  The  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  is  devel-
oping ‘‘green’’ ideas, technologies, and tools to enable the development of highly effi-
cient  and  environmentally  friendly  aircraft  (including  subsonic  aircraft;  supersonic
aircraft;  and  aircraft  with  the  ability  to  take-off  and  land  on  short  runways,  yet
cruise  efficiently  at  transonic  speeds)  and  rotorcraft  to  meet  the  performance  and
environmental  requirements  that  will  be  demanded  by  the  public.  Below  are  some
specific examples of NASA’s ongoing work to mitigate the environmental (and global
climate) impact of aviation:

1. NASA has set aggressive goals for fuel burn, noise, and emissions reductions
for three generations of vehicles (referred to as ‘‘N+1, ‘‘N+2,’’ and ‘‘N+3’’) and
is pursuing technologies that can achieve each of these goals.

2. Advancement of hybrid wing-body vehicle (‘‘N+2’’) technologies for low noise,
higher  performance,  and  better  engine/airframe  integration.  These  efforts
have  the  potential  of  enabling  aircraft  that,  unlike  conventional  tube-and-
wing  aircraft,  can  simultaneously  achieve  significantly  reduced  noise,  emis-
sions, and fuel burn.

3. System-level  understanding  of  laminar  flow  control  techniques  for  applica-
tion in ‘‘N+1’’ and ‘‘N+2’’ concepts. Laminar flow technology can significantly
decrease the fuel burn of both conventional and unconventional aircraft and,
therefore  accomplish  significant  CO2 emissions  reductions  (up  to  50  percent
better than the current state-of-the-art).

4. Aggressive  weight  reduction  technologies  using  advanced  materials  and
structural  concepts  for  both  aircraft  and  engine  structures  with  significant
reduction of CO2 emissions due to decreases in fuel burn.

5. Studies into the necessary technologies and integration approaches to realize
significantly  improved  gas  turbine  engines  with  higher  efficiency  (resulting
in lower CO2 emissions) and lower NOΧ emissions.

6. Efforts to assess the validity and applicability of biofuels/alternative fuels of

various different sources to aviation applications.

7. Approaches  to  improve  the  viability  of  both  supersonic  transports  and  ad-

vanced rotorcraft in the NextGen incorporating environmental constraints.

In  addition,  NASA  has  recently  issued  a  solicitation  for  the  ‘‘N+3’’  generation  of
advanced  vehicles  (see  http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap)  that  will  have  dra-
matically  improved  environmental  performance  to  the  point  that  emissions  of  CO2
will  be  reduced  by  up  to  70  percent  and  the  noise  of  such  aircraft  will  be  barely
noticeable outside airport boundaries.

To  facilitate  the  transition  of  advanced  ideas  and  technologies  into  the  aircraft
fleet, NASA is partnering with the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Contin-
uous Low Emissions, Energy and Noise (CLEEN) program to guide efforts to mature
technologies that have already shown promise to the point where they can be adopt-
ed  by  the  current  and  future  aircraft  fleet.  This  collaboration  with  the  FAA  is  only
one  of  the  many  joint  activities  that  both  agencies  are  pursuing  to  ensure  that  the
environmental  impact  of  aviation  is  significantly  reduced  in  the  presence  of  net
growth.

Finally,  NASA  actively  participates  in  Aviation  Climate  Change  Research  Initia-
tive  (ACCRI)  to  better  understand  and  assess  the  global  climate  impact  of  current
and  future  advanced  vehicles.  In  fact,  the  ‘‘N+3’’  solicitation  is  specifically  address-
ing some of the leading issues in global climate.

It  is  widely  recognized  that  90–95  percent  of  the  environmental  gains  in  the  cur-
rent air transportation system have resulted from improvements in aircraft and air-
craft  technologies.  NASA’s  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  is  ensuring  that,  in
the  future,  dramatic  improvements  can  be  derived  from  the  next  generation  of  air-
craft.

New Flight Regimes

NASA  is  not  fixated  on  developing  new  capabilities  in  just  one  flight  regime,  but
instead believes that an ideal situation will exist when multiple vehicle types exist,
each  suited  for  a  particular  use,  operating  in  an  air  transportation  system  that  is
flexible  enough  to  accommodate  a  wide  range  of  vehicles  without  limiting  perform-
ance.  Examples  of  some  of  the  most  promising  concepts  for  large  improvements  in
aviation include:

• Advanced subsonic/transonic transports with nearly half the fuel burn of cur-
rent  vehicles  (and  therefore  half  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions),  a  noise  foot-
print that can be confined to the boundary of the airport, and local emissions
that  are  far  below  those  encountered  today.  These  gains  will  require  revolu-
tionary  changes  in  the  airframe  and  propulsion  plant  and  the  way  in  which
they  are  integrated  into  a  single  system.  Alternative  sources  of  energy  are
likely to play a significant role in the development of these vehicles.
• Advanced  supersonic  transports  with  comparable  performance  to  their  sub-
sonic/transonic  counterparts  and  with  low  sonic  boom  characteristics  so  that
the aircraft may be allowed to fly supersonically over land. In addition, take-
off  and  landing  noise  will  be  significantly  reduced  to  meet  or  exceed  Stage  4
requirements.
• Cruise-Efficient  Short  Take-Off  and  Landing  (CESTOL)  aircraft  that  cruise
with  very  high  performance  and  low  environmental  impact,  yet  can  take  off
and land from very short runways.

23

• Advanced  rotorcraft  (large  civil  tiltrotors  and  variable-speed  compound  con-
cepts)  that  allow  vertical  or  short  take-off  and  landing  with  vastly  improved
range  and  performance  and  reduced  environmental  impact  (mainly  from
noise).

Knowledge/Technology Transfer

NASA  believes  ‘‘knowledge  transfer’’  is  critical  and  deserves  high  priority  atten-
tion  and  a  concerted  effort  to  ensure  it  happens  in  a  timely  manner.  Emphasizing
‘‘technology transfer’’ only drives a tendency to focus on devices and widgets, rather
than on the knowledge enabling their creation. To ensure broad benefits to the com-
munity,  the  knowledge  that  underpins  any  new  technology  must  be  transferred  to
the  community  such  that  technology  can  be  broadly  applied.  This  ‘‘transfer’’  occurs
at  many  levels  ranging  from  the  exchange  of  fundamental  ideas  to  the  adoption  of
new  systems.  We  have  created  a  number  of  mechanisms  to  enable  such  an  ex-
change.  For  example,  we  have  established  technical  working  groups  to  engage  in-
dustry  and  academic  partners  on  a  regular  basis  in  order  to  facilitate  knowledge
transfer.  Space  Act  Agreements  are  used  to  enable  NASA  to  leverage  industry’s
unique  systems-level  expertise  while  enabling  industry  to  quickly  acquire  research
results.

A  new  process  has  been  established  to  help  ensure  that  NASA’s  fundamental  re-
search  can  be  transitioned  for  implementation  in  NextGen  systems  and  concepts.
NASA Aeronautics, the FAA, and the JPDO are working collaboratively to establish
this  process,  which  ensures  research  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  enable
NextGen. The new process has top-level commitment from the NASA Associate Ad-
ministrator  for  Aeronautics  and  the  FAA  Vice  President  for  Operations  Planning
Services, Air Traffic Organization. A coordinating committee that includes both FAA
and  NASA  representatives  oversees  four  initial  Research  Transition  Teams  (RTT)
that  are  organized  around  the  NextGen  Concept  of  Operations  framework.  This
framework  connects  the  FAA’s  Operational  Evolution  Partnership  elements  with
NASA  research.  The  JPDO  has  an  important  role  in  the  transfer  in  which  they  in-
form  the  Integrated  Work  Plan  as  work  progresses.  The  teams  are  working  to  plan
near-term  R&D  transition  in  areas  such  as  surface  management  and  long-term
transition  in  areas  such  as  dynamic  airspace  allocation.  With  regards  to  the  initial
collaborative  RTT  activity,  more  than  35  participants  from  FAA  service  units,
NASA,  MITRE/CAASD,  and  industry  attended  a  workshop  in  Washington,  DC  in
February 2008 to focus on integration of NASA and FAA research plans, schedules,
roadmaps,  and  coordinated  simulations  for  near-term  NextGen  Trajectory  Manage-
ment objectives.

In  April  2008,  NASA  and  FAA  program,  project,  and  senior  researchers  attended
a RTT kick-off workshop focused on Surface ATM concepts. The primary goal of this
RTT  is  to  jointly  collaborate  on  near-  and  mid-term  objectives  to  reduce  the  risk  of
development  of  an  Integrated  Airport  Surface/Arrival/Departure  system  concept  for
NextGen. Furthermore, NASA and FAA personnel are scheduled to conduct two ad-
ditional RTT workshops early in the summer of 2008. In a fully collaborative effort,
one  workshop  will  work  to  define  the  far-term  NextGen  objectives  of  the  dynamic
airspace  allocation  concept,  and  the  second  will  contribute  to  the  definition  of  mid-
term NextGen roles, responsibilities and objectives for the Multi-Sector Planner con-
cept.

Following  completion  of  the  four  pilot  RTT  workshops,  NASA,  FAA,  and  JPDO
will make improvements to the RTT process based on lessons learned, and continue
the collaboration of researchers and implementers to ensure that the research need-
ed for NextGen is identified, conducted, and transitioned.

Building on NASA’s Research Heritage

It is important to remember that NASA has a long heritage of conducting revolu-
tionary  research.  The  following  are  examples  of  NASA  research  that  are  making  a
difference in aviation today.

• NASA  completed  the  first  test  of  a  digital  fly-by-wire  system  in  a  modified
F–8  Crusader  aircraft  in  1972.  It  was  the  forerunner  of  the  fly-by-wire  flight
control  systems  now  used  on  the  Space  Shuttle  and  on  today’s  military  and
civilian  aircraft  to  make  them  safer,  more  maneuverable  and  more  efficient.
• Winglets are one of the most successful examples of NASA aeronautical inno-
vation  being  utilized  around  the  world  on  all  types  of  aircraft.  Winglets  are
vertical  extensions  of  wingtips  that  improve  an  aircraft’s  fuel  efficiency  and
cruising range.

• The  FAA  is  engaged  in  national  deployment  of  the  NASA-developed  Traffic
Management Advisor (TMA) tool. TMA is now a component of the FAA’s Free
Flight program to increase the capacity of the Nation’s airspace. The applica-
tion enables en route air traffic controllers and traffic management specialists
to  develop  complete  arrival-scheduling  plans.  These  plans  help  maximize  an
airport’s  use  of  available  capacity  by  making  early  runway  assignments  for
arriving aircraft and spacing aircraft so that they reach the airport at appro-
priate intervals.

• NASA’s  work  improved  aviation  safety  in  hazardous  weather  conditions
caused by wind-shear. In collaboration with industry and the FAA, NASA de-
veloped  and  validated  on-board  aircraft  wind-shear  sensors  that  could  detect
and measure the intensity of wind-shear conditions ahead of the aircraft, such
that a pilot could be alerted in time to safely avoid a hazardous weather con-
dition.

Figure  1  at  the  end  of  this  testimony  depicts  some  of  these  improvements  along

with others that have made a difference in the way we safely travel today.

Recent Accomplishments

After  undergoing  a  thorough  reformulation  period,  all  of  ARMD’s  programs  are
now  in  full  implementation.  The  most  important  ‘‘thing’’  that  these  programs  gen-
erate  is  knowledge.  To  validate  our  accomplishments  and  disseminate  our  results,
we have placed a renewed emphasis on publication in peer-reviewed references and
Program  planning  accounts  for  the  effort  needed  to  document  research  results.
While  there  are  too  many  success  stories  over  the  past  two  years  to  list,  here  are
a few examples of recent accomplishments.

• In  partnership  with  Boeing  and  the  Air  Force  Research  Laboratory  (AFRL),
the  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  successfully  completed  several  flight
tests  of  a  blended  wing  body  (BWB)  aircraft,  named  X–48B,  which  has  the
potential to provide increased capacity, increased fuel efficiency and decreased
noise  compared  to  today’s  aircraft.  The  X–48B  was  cited  as  one  of  the  ‘‘Best
Innovations of the Year 2007’’ by Time Magazine.

• The  Fundamental  Aeronautics  Program  successfully  demonstrated,  in  part-
nership  with  Pratt  &  Whitney,  the  feasibility  of  a  high-efficiency  fan  design
for an ultrahigh bypass ratio turbofan engine that, in combination with other
technologies,  has  the  potential  for  achieving  significant  noise  reduction  for
aircraft.

• The  Aviation  Safety  Program  developed  new  data-mining  tools  to  integrate
and analyze large quantities of operational flight data to detect potential sys-
temic  problems  across  a  fleet  of  aircraft.  The  ability  to  automatically  detect
and identify hidden anomalies or trends in aircraft systems will enable correc-
tive action to be taken in a timely manner before an unsafe situation occurs.
• The Aviation Safety Program designed and built a new silicon carbide circuit
chip  that  has  exceeded  6,000  hours  of  continuous  operation  at  500  degrees
Celsius (C) in a laboratory environment. The highly durable packaging of cir-
cuit  chips  is  being  developed  to  enable  extremely  functional  but  physically
small  and  resilient  circuitry  that  can  provide  constant  engine  health  moni-
toring, even in the harsh conditions in the hot sections of jet engines.

• To better enable effective decision-making essential for NextGen, the Airspace
Systems  Program  developed  an  aircraft-level  flow  control  model  to  examine
the  impact  of  constraints  (such  as  ground-delay  decisions  due  to  congestion)
on  flows  into  and  out  of  New  York  area  airports.  The  study  examined  vari-
ations  in  the  geographical  location  of  constraints,  magnitude  of  constraints,
and  flow  prioritization  approaches,  and  found  that  prioritizing  New  York
flows  through  congested  sectors  is  possible  without  increasing  system  delays.
• The  Airspace  Systems  Program  developed  an  initial  concept  for  Airspace
Super  Density  Operations  that  meets  the  multiple  objectives  of  NextGen  ter-
minal airspace operations: significantly increased capacity, robustness to var-
ied  and  chaotic  weather  conditions,  reduced  environmental  impact,  and  co-
ordination of arrival and departure operations to/from multiple proximate air-
ports.  Initial  assessments  of  core  elements  were  conducted  including:  closely-
spaced approach procedures, continuous descent arrival operations, 4D trajec-
tory  navigation,  delegated  spacing  function  and  dynamic  routing  to  avoid  ad-
verse weather.

Success Through Partnerships

25

NASA  believes  we  should  be  in  the  leadership  position  to  conduct  fundamental
research  required  to  solve  all  the  aeronautics  challenges  listed  above.  However,
NASA also believes that we do this in close and strong partnerships with industry,
academia  and  other  government  agencies  in  order  to  maximize  the  research  capa-
bilities  of  the  Nation.  Because  these  partnerships  are  so  important,  NASA  has  put
many  mechanisms  in  place  to  engage  academia  and  industry,  including  industry
working  groups  and  technical  interchange  meetings  at  the  program  and  project
level,  Space  Act  Agreements  for  cooperative  partnerships  with  industry,  and  the
NRA  process  that  provides  full  and  open  competition  for  the  best  and  most  prom-
ising research ideas. Cooperative partnerships with industry consortia can result in
a  significant  leverage  of  resources  for  all  partners  and  can  provide  opportunities  to
test  the  value  of  component-technology  advances  in  full  system-level  contexts.  All
research  results,  whether  generated  by  NASA  internally  or  by  its  partners  through
the  NRA,  will  be  openly  disseminated  through  archival  publications  and  conference
proceedings as well as NASA publications to benefit broad U.S. aeronautics commu-
nity while ensuring the dissemination policy is consistent with national security and
foreign policy guidelines.

ARMD  is  actively  using  the  NRA  mechanism  to  foster  collaboration  with  aca-
demia,  industry,  and  non-profit  organizations.  The  first  Research  Opportunities  in
Aeronautics NRA was released in May 2006 and since then two more versions have
been issued on an annual basis. The response to the NRA has been tremendous. As
of  the  end  of  April  2008,  more  than  1380  proposals  have  been  received  resulting  in
more than 327 awards. An important aspect of these awards is that they are closely
aligned with the research goals of internal NASA efforts. This results in a coopera-
tive arrangement that is mutually beneficial to NASA and to the performing organi-
zation. The NRA is based on the principle of full and open competition and provides
an  ideal  mechanism  for  bringing  the  best  ideas  from  across  the  Nation  to  bear  on
particular problems.

Last year, ARMD established over 30 Space Act Agreements with different mem-
bers  of  the  aerospace  industry  and,  in  some  situations,  with  consortia  of  industrial
participants.  These  collaborative  opportunities  have  produced  very  significant  re-
search  results  at  the  system  level  where  the  expertise  of  industry  and  NASA  come
together to integrate technologies that can, one day, be incorporated into the aircraft
fleet.

Finally, NASA recognizes the importance of close coordination not just with indus-
try  and  academia,  but  with  its  partners  in  other  government  agencies  as  well.  For
example,  NASA  and  the  JPDO  have  established  quarterly  reviews  to  ensure  close
coordination,  and  NASA  participates  in  all  major  JPDO  planning  activities.  NASA
and  the  FAA  have  developed  a  joint  program  plan  for  the  Aviation  Safety  Informa-
tion  Analysis  and  Sharing  (ASIAS)  effort  with  well  defined  roles  and  responsibil-
ities.  NASA  and  the  Department  of  Defense  have  signed  an  MOU  to  facilitate  the
establishment  of  an  integrated  national  strategy  for  the  management  of  their  re-
spective  aeronautics  test  facilities.  NASA  and  the  U.S.  Air  Force  have  established
an  Executive  Research  Council  that  meets  at  least  twice  a  year  to  ensure  close  co-
ordination and collaboration. And lastly, NASA and the Army have signed a Memo-
randum of Understanding to coordinate research efforts on rotorcraft.

Conclusion

NASA Aeronautics is now in full execution of a robust fundamental research pro-
gram  that  is  well  aligned  with  the  National  Aeronautics  R&D  Policy  and  directly
supports the development of the NextGen system. NASA Aeronautics pursues long-
term,  cutting-edge  research  to  address  new  challenges  in  the  Nation’s  air  transpor-
tation system and to support the Agency’s space exploration vision. ARMD’s commit-
ment  to  technical  excellence  with  strong  partnerships  with  industry,  academia  and
other  government  agencies  will  ensure  our  reputation  as  the  world’s  premier  aero-
nautics R&D organization.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Shin.
Mr. Meade.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  CARL  J.  MEADE,  CO-CHAIR,  COMMITTEE
FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF NASA’S AERONAUTICS RESEARCH
PROGRAM, NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL
Mr.  MEADE.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,
thank  you  for  inviting  me  here  to  testify  today.  My  colleague,  Dr.
Donald  Richardson,  and  I  are  co-chairs  of  the  National  Research
Council’s Committee for the Assessment of NASA’s Aeronautics Re-
search  Program,  and  it  is  in  that  capacity  that  I  appear  to  you
today.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  the  views  I  offer  are  strictly  those
of  the  Committee  and  not  those  of  my  employer,  Northrop  Grum-
man Corporation.

In  addition  to  responding  to  the  questions  posed  by  the  Sub-
committee  in  its  April  17th  invitation  to  appear,  which  will  be  an-
notated  in  my  written  testimony,  I  would  like  to  make  some  gen-
eral observations.

Our  committee  evaluated  NASA’s  entire  aeronautics  portfolio,
both civil and non-civil. However, the majority of our attention was
devoted  to  the  request  by  Congress  to  assess  NASA’s  aeronautics
research program against a very specific benchmark, which was the
Decadal  Survey  of  Civil  Aeronautics,  published  by  the  NRC  in
2006.  Therefore,  most  of  our  findings  and  recommendations  are
centered around that comparison.

The NASA aeronautics research program does have room for im-
provement,  both  in  its  direction  and  its  execution.  When  assessing
NASA’s  research  against  the  recommendations  of  the  decadal  sur-
vey,  we  found  mixed  results.  Our  study  found  that  NASA’s  efforts
to achieve 20 of the 51 decadal survey technologies have no signifi-
cant shortcomings or very minor shortcomings that are recoverable
within  the  overall  project  concept  and  will  substantially  advance
the  state-of-the-art.  Seven  of  the  51  have  major  shortcomings  that
would be difficult to recover within the current overall project con-
cept. For the remaining 24 challenges, NASA is effectively address-
ing  some  areas  but  not  others  and  so  the  results  can  best  be  de-
scribed as mixed.

Your  subcommittee  specifically  requested  information  regarding
safety and environmental challenges. I will try to summarize those
right  now.  Of  the  20  challenges  identified  with  little  or  no  short-
comings,  about  half  are  related  to  safety  or  the  environment.  The
same  can  be  said  for  the  other  categories  I  just  outlined,  and  this
is  consistent  with  the  safety  and  environmental  content  of  the  en-
tire  set  of  51  technology  challenges,  which  is  about  half  related  to
safety and the environment.

It would be easy to misinterpret our findings as largely negative.
This is not the intent of the Committee, nor would it be proper in-
terpretation  to  regard  the  results  of  our  study  as  an  indictment  of
the  performance  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Direc-
torate.  Our  committee  would  like  to  emphasize  that  by  and  large,
we found the ARMD workforce to be both dedicated and competent.
Having  said  that,  it  does  not  appear  that  the  ARMD  has  re-
sponded  in  any  significant  way  to  the  recommendations  of  the
decadal  survey.  Keep  in  mind,  however,  that  the  Decadal  Survey

29

of  Civil  Aeronautics  was  the  first  survey  of  its  kind  published  in
aeronautics.  Consequently,  ARMD  has  no  experience  in  utilizing
decadal  surveys,  which  may  help  explain  why  the  directorate  did
not respond immediately to its publication.

To  properly  understand  our  report,  it  is  also  important  to  keep
in  mind  that  the  authors  of  the  decadal  survey  itself  were  not
bound by budgetary considerations, and this unlike decadal surveys
from  other  scientific  disciplines  which  we  have  seen  in  the  recent
past.  Therefore,  it  is  not  unexpected  that  the  ARMD  would  not  be
able  to  make  progress  on  all  51  of  the  technology  challenges  con-
tained  in  the  decadal  survey.  In  fact,  barring  an  increase  in  fund-
ing for this activity, we have recommended that ARMD redefine its
scope  and  address  only  the  challenges  with  the  highest  priorities
where  significant,  timely  progress  can  be  made  in  advancing  the
state of the art.

Aside  from  the  quality  of  the  research  conducted  by  ARMD,  we
would stress the need for a cultural change within the directorate.
Indeed,  the  Committee  was  most  concerned  about  the  lack  of  ur-
gency demonstrated by some projects and the tendency of some re-
searchers  to  assume  that  the  ultimate  consumer  of  the  fruits  of
their labor was NASA itself. As one example, one of ARMD’s three
operating principles states, and I quote, ‘‘We will focus our research
in areas that are appropriate to NASA’s unique capabilities.’’ In my
opinion, NASA and the country would be better served if the prin-
ciples  were  revised  to  include  ‘‘We  will  mold  NASA’s  unique  capa-
bilities to enable research in the most vital areas.’’

I will be glad to answer any questions you may have.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Meade follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CARL J. MEADE

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify
today.  My  colleague,  Dr.  Donald  Richardson,  and  I  are  Co-Chairs  of  the  National
Research  Council’s  Committee  for  the  Assessment  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research
Program.  I  appear  here  today  in  my  capacity  as  Co-Chair  of  that  committee.  The
views I share with you, are those of the Committee, not those of my employer, Nor-
throp Grumman Corporation.

The  Subcommittee’s  April  17,  2008  letter  to  me  requesting  this  testimony  posed

three questions that are addressed below.
1. What  were  the  major  findings  and  recommendations  of  your  recently
completed  assessment  of  NASA’s  fundamental  aeronautics  research  pro-
gram?
Our  committee  assessed  the  entirety  of  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research  Program
and  made  several  recommendations  to  NASA  to  improve  its  ability  to  (1)  meet  the
high-priority technology challenges that are identified in the Decadal Survey of Civil
Aeronautics, which was published by the National Research Council in 2006, (2) ad-
dress NASA’s internal requirements for aeronautics research (e.g., to support robotic
and human space exploration), and (3) satisfy non-civil aeronautics research require-
ments  that  NASA  is  addressing  in  agreement  with  other  federal  agencies  and  de-
partments. The committee also addressed workforce expertise and research facilities
relevant to the goals of NASA’s Aeronautics research program.

The committee determined that the strategic objectives of the Decadal Survey are
consistent  with  the  key  principles  of  the  National  Aeronautics  Research  and  Devel-
opment  Policy  (NSTC,  2006)  and  the  National  Plan  for  Aeronautics  Research  and
Development  and  Related  Infrastructure  (NSTC,  2007).  Thus,  the  recommendations
below will also help achieve the goals of the National Policy and Plan.

RESOURCES VERSUS SCOPE OF RESEARCH

30

NASA supports a great deal of worthwhile research. However, NASA must deter-
mine how to respond to a vast array of worthwhile research possibilities within the
constraints  of  budget,  facilities,  workforce  composition,  and  federal  policies.  The
Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics (NRC, 2006), recommended that NASA use the
51  highest-priority  Research  and  Technology  (R&T)  challenges  in  the  Decadal  Sur-
vey  as  the  foundation  for  the  future  of  NASA’s  civil  aeronautics  research  program
during  the  next  decade.  However,  the  Decadal  Survey  was  designed  to  identify  the
highest-priority  R&T  challenges  without  considering  the  cost  or  affordability  of
meeting  the  challenges.1 As  a  result,  even  though  the  NASA  aeronautics  program
has the technical ability to address each of the highest-priority R&T challenges from
the  Decadal  Survey  individually  (through  in-house  research  and/or  partnerships
with external research organizations), NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Direc-
torate  (ARMD)  would  require  a  substantial  budget  increase  to  address  all  of  the
challenges in a thorough and comprehensive manner.

In  addition  to  resource  limitations,  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  program  faces
many  other  constraints  (in  terms  of  the  existing  set  of  NASA  centers,  limitations
on the ability to transfer staff positions among centers, and limitations on the abil-
ity  to  compete  with  the  private  sector  in  terms  of  financial  compensation  in  some
critical fields), and attempting to address too many research objectives will severely
limit the ability to develop new core competencies and unique capabilities that may
be vital to the future of U.S. aeronautics.

Recommendation.  The  NASA  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  should
ensure  that  its  research  program  substantively  advances  the  state-of-the-art  and
makes  a  significant  difference  in  a  time  frame  of  interest  to  users  of  the  research
results  by  (1)  making  a  concerted  effort  to  identify  the  potential  users  of  on-going
research and how that research relates to those needs and (2) prioritizing potential
research  opportunities  according  to  an  accepted  set  of  metrics.  In  addition,  absent
a substantial increase in funding and/or a substantial reduction in other constraints
that  NASA  faces  in  conducting  aeronautics  research  (such  as  facilities,  workforce
composition,  and  federal  policies),  NASA,  in  consultation  with  the  aeronautics  re-
search  community  and  others  as  appropriate,  should  redefine  the  scope  and  prior-
ities  within  the  aeronautics  research  program  to  be  consistent  with  available  re-
sources and the priorities identified in (2), above (even if all 51 highest-priority R&T
challenges from the Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics are not addressed simulta-
neously).  This  would  improve  the  value  of  the  research  that  the  aeronautics  pro-
gram is able to perform, and it would make resources available to facilitate the de-
velopment  of  new  core  competencies  and  unique  capabilities  that  may  be  essential
to the Nation and to the NASA aeronautics program of the future.

ASSESSMENT RESULTS—MEETING THE R&T CHALLENGES

The basic planning documents for most of NASA’s research projects were prepared
before the Decadal Survey was published in 2006, and the NASA research portfolio,
as  a  whole,  does  not  seem  to  have  changed  course  in  response  to  the  Decadal  Sur-
vey.  Thus,  the  content  of  the  Decadal  Survey  of  Civil  Aeronautics  appears  to  not
have been a significant factor in the selection of the research portfolio being pursued
by many of the ARMD’s research projects.

NASA  is  doing  a  mixed  job  in  responding  to  the  51  highest-priority  R&T  chal-
lenges in the Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics. In a few cases, the shortcomings
noted by the Committee (both major and minor) indicate that NASA research plans
are  poorly  conceived  and  the  resulting  research  will  likely  be  ineffective.  In  most
cases,  however,  shortcomings  reflect  inconsistencies  between  NASA  project  plans
and  the  Decadal  Survey.  These  inconsistencies  are  generally  the  result  of  NASA
choosing  to  do  little  or  no  work  in  a  particular  task  area  and/or  selecting  research
goals  that  fall  short  of  advancing  the  state-of-the-art  far  enough  and  with  enough
urgency  either  to  make  a  substantial  difference  in  meeting  individual  R&T  chal-
lenges or the larger goal of achieving the strategic objectives of the Decadal Survey
of  Civil  Aeronautics.  However,  as  noted  above,  NASA  does  not  have  the  resources
necessary to address all 51 R&T challenges simultaneously in a thorough and com-
prehensive  manner,  and  so  (regardless  of  how  the  projects  plans  were  developed)  it
is inevitable that the plans, as a whole, do not fully address all the priorities of the
Decadal Survey.

1 Other decadal surveys that the NRC routinely produces for NASA in the space sciences con-
sider  budgetary  factors  in  formulating  their  findings  and  recommendations,  and  it  may  be
worthwhile to follow that model in future decadal surveys for aeronautics research.

WORKFORCE

There are—among NASA, the academic community, and the civilian aerospace in-
dustry—enough  skilled  research  personnel  to  adequately  support  the  current  aero-
nautics  research  programs  at  NASA  and  nationwide,  at  least  for  the  next  decade
or  so.  NASA  may  experience  some  localized  problems  at  some  centers,  but  the  req-
uisite intellectual capacity exists at the various centers and/or in organizations out-
side  NASA.  Thus,  NASA  should  be  able  to  achieve  its  research  goals,  for  example,
by  using  NASA  Research  Announcements  or  other  procurement  mechanisms;
through the use of higher, locally competitive salaries in selected disciplines at some
centers;  and/or  by  creating  a  virtual  workforce  that  integrates  staff  from  multiple
centers with the skills necessary to address a particular research task. The content
of  the  NASA  aeronautics  program,  which  has  a  large  portfolio  of  tool  development
but  little  or  no  opportunities  for  flight  tests,  may  in  some  cases  hamper  the  ability
to  recruit  new  staff  as  compared  with  the  space  exploration  program.  In  addition,
there  will  likely  be  increased  requirements  for  specialized  or  new  skill  sets.  Work-
force  problems  and  inefficiencies  can  also  arise  from  fluctuations  in  national  aero-
space  engineering  employment  and  from  uneven  funding  in  particular  areas  of  en-
deavor.

Recommendation.  To  ensure  that  the  NASA  aeronautics  program  has  and  will
continue to have an adequate supply of trained employees, the Aeronautics Research
Mission  Directorate  should  develop  a  vision  describing  the  role  of  its  research  staff
as well as a comprehensive, centralized strategic plan for workforce integration and
implementation specific to ARMD. The plan should be based on an ARMD-wide sur-
vey  of  staffing  requirements  by  skill  level,  coupled  with  an  availability  analysis  of
NASA  civil  servants  available  to  support  the  NASA  aeronautics  program.  The  plan
should identify specific gaps and the time frame in which they should be addressed.
It  should  also  define  the  role  of  NASA  civil  servant  researchers  vis-a`-vis  external
researchers in terms of the following:

• Defining,  achieving,  and  maintaining  an  appropriate  balance  between  in-
house  research  and  external  research  (by  academia  and  industry)  in  each
project  and  task,  recognizing  that  the  appropriate  balance  will  not  be  the
same in all areas.

• Defining  and  addressing  issues  related  to  research  involving  multi-discipli-
nary  capabilities  and  system  design  (i.e.,  research  at  Levels  3  and  4,  respec-
tively, as defined by ARMD).

• Ensuring that research projects continue to make progress when NASA works
with  outside  organizations  to  obtain  some  of  the  requisite  expertise  (when
that expertise is not resident in NASA’s civil servant workforce).

NASA  should  use  the  National  Research  Council  report  Building  a  Better  NASA
Workforce  (NRC,  2007)  as  a  starting  point  in  developing  a  comprehensive  ARMD
workforce plan.

FACILITIES

NASA has a unique set of aeronautics research facilities that provide key support
to  NASA,  other  federal  departments  and  agencies,  and  industry.  With  very  few  ex-
ceptions,  these  facilities  meet  the  relevant  needs  of  existing  aeronautics  research.
NASA also has a dedicated effort for sustaining large, key facilities and for shutting
down  low-priority  facilities.  However,  some  small  facilities  (particularly  in  the  su-
personic  regime)  are  just  as  important  as  some  larger  facilities  and  may  warrant
more  support  than  they  currently  receive.  In  addition,  at  the  current  investment
rate,  widespread  facility  degradation  will  inevitably  impact  the  ability  of  ARMD
projects  and  other  important  national  aeronautics  research  and  development  to
achieve their goals.

Recommendation. Absent a substantial increase in facility maintenance and in-
vestment  funds,  NASA  should  reduce  the  impact  of  facility  shortcomings  by  con-
tinuing  to  assess  facilities  and  mothball  or  de-commission  facilities  of  lesser  impor-
tance so that the most important facilities can be properly sustained.
2. Your report stresses the importance of ensuring that NASA’s aeronautics
research results are transferred to industry, the FAA, and other organi-
zations  that  manufacture,  own,  and  operate  key  elements  of  the  air
transportation system. What needs to be done to ensure that the transfer
takes place in an efficient and effective manner?

USER CONNECTIONS

32

NASA civil aeronautics research will provide value to its stakeholders if and only
if the results are ultimately transferred to industry, to the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration,  and  to  the  other  organizations  that  manufacture,  own,  and  operate  key
elements  of  the  air  transportation  system.  A  closer  connection  between  the  man-
agers  of  NASA  aeronautics  research  projects  and  some  potential  users  of  NASA  re-
search  would  ensure  that  the  need  to  transfer  research  results  to  users  is  properly
considered  in  project  planning  and  execution,  and  it  would  facilitate  the  formation
of a coordinated set of research goals and milestones that are timed to meet the fu-
ture  needs  of  the  Nation.  In  addition,  for  technology  intended  to  enhance  the  com-
petitiveness  of  U.S.  industry,  U.S.  leadership  would  be  enhanced  by  a  technology-
transfer  process  that  does  not  necessarily  include  the  immediate,  public  dissemina-
tion  of  results  to  potential  foreign  competitors,  so  that  the  U.S.  industrial  base  has
a head start in absorbing the fruits of this research.

Recommendation.  The  NASA  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  should
bridge  the  gap  between  research  and  application—and  thereby  increase  the  likeli-
hood that this research will be of value to the intended users—as follows:

able in time to meet the future needs of the Nation.

• Foster  closer  connections  between  NASA  principal  investigators  and  the  po-
tential  external  and  internal  users  of  their  research,  which  include  U.S.  in-
dustry, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, aca-
demia, and the NASA space program.
• Improve  research  planning  to  ensure  that  the  results  are  likely  to  be  avail-
• Consistently  articulate  during  the  course  of  project  planning  and  execution
how research results are tied to capability improvements and how results will
be transferred to users.
• For  technology  intended  to  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  U.S.  industry,  es-
tablish  a  more  direct  link  between  NASA  and  U.S.  industry  to  provide  for
technology transfer in a way that does not necessarily include the immediate,
public dissemination of results to potential foreign competitors.

As part of the effort to implement this recommendation, NASA should ensure that
the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS/NextGen) Air Traffic Man-
agement  (ATM)–Airportal  Project  and  the  NGATS  ATM–Airspace  Project  meet  the
research and development (R&D) needs defined by the NextGen Joint Planning and
Development Office (JPDO) for NASA.2
3. Do you have any recommendations for the Committee to consider as we

prepare to draft a NASA reauthorization bill?
NASA  has  a  critical  part  to  play  in  preserving  the  role  of  the  United  States  as
a leader in aeronautics. NASA research facilities and expertise support research by
other  federal  agencies  and  industry,  and  the  results  of  research  conducted  and/or
sponsored by NASA are embodied in key elements of the air transportation system,
military  aviation,  and  the  U.S.  space  program.  NASA  aeronautics  research  will
carry  on  this  tradition  as  long  as  its  research  is  properly  prioritized  and  research
tasks  are  executed  with  enough  depth  and  vigor  to  produce  meaningful  results  in
a  timely  fashion.  Accordingly,  the  effectiveness  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  research
would  be  enhanced  by  Congressional  direction  to  implement  the  high-priority  re-
search  challenges  in  the  Decadal  Survey  of  Civil  Aeronautics.  Congress  may  also
choose  to  relax  the  constraints  that  limit  the  ability  of  NASA  to  implement  a  more
robust  aeronautics  research  program.  As  noted  above,  constraints  of  particular  in-
terest include the budget, facilities, workforce composition, and related federal poli-
cies.

2 The  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  is  now  most  commonly  abbreviated  as
NextGen,  but  the  titles  of  NASA’s  related  research  projects  still  feature  the  old  acronym,
NGATS.

BIOGRAPHY FOR CARL J. MEADE

Mr. Meade is currently the Director of Space Systems at Northrop Grumman Cor-
poration’s Integrated Systems sector in El Segundo, California. He and his team are
responsible for the capture and execution of various government projects relating to
crewed space flight and non-payload military space vehicles. He was previously em-
ployed at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (aka ‘‘Skunk Works’’) in Palmdale,
California  where  he  was  responsible  for  the  development  of  a  portfolio  of  advanced
aerospace  vehicles.  He  also  held  numerous  positions  on  the  X–33  program—first  as
Flight Assurance Manager, then as Operations Manager, and finally as the Program
Director.  Immediately  prior  to  his  arrival  at  Lockheed  Martin,  Carl  was  an  Air
Force officer on astronaut duty with NASA.

Carl  began  his  aerospace  career  as  a  Hughes  Fellow  at  the  California  Institute
of Technology. After completing his graduate degree, Carl continued employment at
Hughes  Aircraft  Company  as  an  electronics  design  engineer.  He  was  then  called  to

active military duty and flew tactical fighter aircraft in the U.S. Air Force. He was
selected for test pilot training in 1980 and graduated first in his class at the USAF
Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB.

While  assigned  to  the  Air  Force  Flight  Test  Center,  Carl  tested  various  fighter
aircraft  and  instructed  at  the  USAF  Test  Pilot  School.  Selected  as  an  astronaut  in
June 1985, Carl was assigned to the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston where
he held a variety of technical and leadership assignments. He flew as an Astronaut
on  Space  Shuttle  missions  STS–38,  STS–50  and  STS–64.  During  an  untethered
space  walk  on  STS–64,  he  performed  the  first  flight-test  of  a  rescue  jet-pack  and
was consequently awarded the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross.

Carl has authored several publications and is a member of the Society of Experi-
mental Test Pilots and the Association of Space Explorers. He has served as a mem-
ber of the National Research Council’s committee evaluating the National Aerospace
Initiative  and  also  on  committee  assessing  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Research  Mission
Directorate.  He  holds  an  undergraduate  degree  in  Electrical  Engineering  from  the
University  of  Texas  at  Austin,  and  a  graduate  degree  in  the  same  field  from  the
California Institute of Technology. During most weekends, you can find Carl teamed
with his wife, Celyna, and sons David, Jacob and Michael in a futile attempt to con-
vert their patch of Mojave Desert into a tropical oasis. Between tours of duty in the
yard,  Carl  finds  that  the  experimental  aircraft  currently  under  construction  in  his
shop provides ample opportunity to consume all remaining free time.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Meade.
Mr. Henne.

STATEMENT OF MR. PRESTON A. HENNE, SENIOR VICE PRESI-
DENT,  PROGRAMS,  ENGINEERING  AND  TESTING,  GULF-
STREAM AEROSPACE CORPORATION
Mr.  HENNE.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,

thank you for this opportunity to testify before your committee.

My employer, Gulfstream Aerospace, is headquartered in Savan-
nah,  Georgia,  with  some  9,800  employees.  Gulfstream  is  a  $5  bil-
lion annual revenue company that designs, builds and services pre-
mium  business  aircraft.  We  have  major  facilities  in  eight  states
within  our  continental  borders.  Gulfstream  has  a  current  product
line  of  seven  different  models  ranging  in  price  from  $14  million  to
$59  million.  Our  primary  competitors  are  Canadian  with  Bom-
bardier, French with Dassault and Brazilian with Embraer.

Foreign  countries  and  businesses  recognize  the  huge  value  asso-
ciated  with  strong  aeronautics  enterprise.  You  have  already—both
the  Members  have  identified  the  value  of  aeronautics  today  and  I
won’t delve into that. But foreign countries recognize and invest in
national  aeronautics  enterprises.  The  United  States  seems  to  take
aeronautics  for  granted,  often  describing  it  in  political  circles  as  a
mature industry, able to fend for itself in terms of continuing R&D
needs. I suspect, however, that we should not be ready to close the
aeronautical patent office.

To  give  one  grand  example,  successful  civil  supersonic  transpor-
tation  is  still  to  be  achieved,  yet  we  continually  see  decreasing
NASA  aeronautics  R&D  budgets.  Over  the  past  10  years  funding
in  NASA  aeronautics  research  has  declined  by  some  48  percent
from  over  $1  billion  to  somewhere  around  $622  million  today.  The
United  States  is  down  to  one  civil  aircraft  manufacturer  and
doesn’t  even  participate  in  the  regional  jet  manufacturing  market.
Gulfstream  used  to  be  alone  in  the  large  cabin  business  jets.  We
now  have  three  strong  foreign  competitors  intent  on  capturing  our
market.  More  importantly,  they  are  keen  on  capturing  the  engine
for jobs and economic growth.

Why  is  it  important  for  the  Federal  Government  to  invest  in
aeronautical R&D? The aeronautics enterprise contribution to jobs,
to  tax  revenues,  to  favorable  balance  of  trade,  as  you,  Mr.  Chair-
man,  have  already  mentioned,  is  massive.  The  recent  Executive
Order establishing a national aeronautics R&D policy states, ‘‘Con-
tinued  progress  in  aeronautics,  the  science  of  flight,  is  essential  to
America’s economic success.’’

Congress  in  1958  directed  that  government-sponsored  aero-
nautical  activities  be  conducted  to  contribute  materially  to  specific
objectives  including  the  following:  improvement  of  the  usefulness,
performance,  speed,  safety  and  efficiency  of  aeronautical  vehicles
and  the  preservation  of  the  role  of  the  United  States  as  a  leader
in aeronautical technology.

The  role  of  federal  investment  in  aeronautics  is  to  advance  U.S.
technological  leadership,  to  lead  innovation  and  to  develop  ad-
vanced aeronautics concepts and technologies. It is the catalyst for
progress.

In  the  past,  NASA  aeronautics  has  served  as  a  great  source  of
aeronautical R&D efforts. Dr. Shin mentioned some of those. How-
ever,  with  the  ever-decreasing  budgets,  this  pipeline  is  drying  up.
In  recent  years,  even  vehicle  technology  demonstrations,  a  vital
risk  reduction  link  between  basic  R&D  and  product  application,
have  been  terminated.  This  has  been  a  substantial  blow  to  matur-
ing  aeronautical  technologies  and  for  U.S.  companies  involved.
Clearly, our aeronautics program needs a revitalization effort to ad-
dress existing priorities and to address the insufficient aeronautics
research funding.

How  do  we  ensure  that  it  is  relevant?  The  following  consider-
ations  are  put  forth.  An  understanding  that  the  status  quo  with
ever-reducing  budgets  isn’t  working.  NASA  aeronautics  needs  to
work beyond just fundamentals and take a continuing role in tech-
nology demonstration, and the split, the public-private funding par-
ticipation, needs to be more balanced in an equitable situation.

According  to  a  recent  article  in  a  well-respected  trade  publica-
tion,  government  versus  private  expenditures  for  all  U.S.  R&D
have  virtually  reversed  themselves  in  the  last  45  years.  In  1964,
the  government  funded  64  percent  of  all  R&D.  In  2006,  industry
funded 66 percent, or roughly $220 billion in R&D funding.

Specifically,  NASA’s  aeronautics  budget  should  be  increased  to
fund research into NextGen. We have already heard that. Environ-
ment research, we have heard that. In aviation safety, NASA clear-
ly plays an important role in all of those areas.

In opening new flight regimes, NASA should be leading the way.
Frankly,  what  more  important  leadership  role  can  NASA  aero-
nautics have? As mentioned earlier, we have yet to achieve success-
ful  supersonic  civil  transportation.  To  achieve  that  really  requires
improvements  in  aeronautical  technology,  technology  demonstra-
tions.  This  is  what  NASA  aeronautics  has  historically  excelled  in
and should continue to excel in. Risk reduction and barrier removal
in  R&D  focused  on  new  flight  regimes  is  a  strong  inducement  for
commercial  growth,  job  creation  and  protecting  the  national  aero-
nautics leadership position.

In  closing,  my  recommendations  are:  that  the  budget  for  NASA
aeronautics  must  increase  substantially,  the  reestablishment  of

NASA  aeronautics  as  a  vital  R&D  activity;  a  high-priority  activity
supporting  a  broad  group  of  U.S.  companies  needs  to  happen;
NASA  aeronautics  procurement  policies  need  to  allow  commercial
contracting  practices;  U.S.  Government  action  to  minimize  foreign
competitor  advantages  due  to  strong  financial  aid  needs  to  occur;
and  separation  of  aeronautics  activity  out  of  the  space  agency  as
a  means  to  implement  a  strong  aeronautics  R&D  policy  needs  to
be considered.

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  express  these

views, and I look forward to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Henne follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PRESTON A. HENNE

Mr. Chairman, Members of the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee:

It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss the status of NASA’s Aeronautics pro-

gram.

By  way  of  introduction,  my  name  is  Preston  Henne  and  I  am  Senior  VP  of  Pro-
grams,  Engineering  and  Test  at  Gulfstream  Aerospace.  Gulfstream  headquarters
are in Savannah, GA and has roughly 9800 employees. Gulfstream is a $5B annual
revenue company that designs, builds and services premium business aircraft. Gulf-
stream proudly has facility sites in eight states within our continental borders. Our
supply  chain  is  extensive  and  accounts  for  supplier  employees  in  literally  every
state,  producing  goods  and  services  in  support  of  our  product  line.  Gulfstream  has
a  current  product  line  of  seven  different  models  ranging  in  price  from  $14M  to
$59M. Our primary competitors are Canadian (Bombardier), French (Dassault), and
Brazilian (Embraer).

In the 105 years of flight, aeronautics has become integral to the world’s culture.
Aeronautical  products  and  services  touch  nearly  everyone  in  the  world  in  one  way
or another. The U.S. leadership in developing and applying aeronautical technology
over  the  last  100  years  is  indisputable.  This  leadership  has  provided  remarkable
commercial  growth  and  economic  opportunity  for  millions  and  millions  of  people  in
the U.S. However, this aeronautical leadership and, more importantly, the opportu-
nities associated with it, are being strongly challenged by foreign competition in the
world market place.

Foreign  countries  and  businesses  recognize  the  huge  value  associated  with  a
strong  aeronautics  enterprise,  and  are  clearly  willing  to  invest  national  as  well  as
corporate treasuries to grow it. The U.S., on the other hand, seems to take the aero-
nautics  enterprise  for  granted.  It  is  often  described  in  political  circles  as  a  mature
industry  and  able  to  fend  for  itself  in  terms  of  continuing  R&D  needs.  I  suspect,
however, that we should not be ready to close the aeronautical patent office. As but
one  grand  example,  financially  successful  and  environmentally  acceptable  civil  su-
personic  transportation  is  still  to  be  achieved.  Yet,  we  see  continually  decreasing
NASA  Aeronautics  R&D  budgets.  To  illustrate  this  point,  the  downward  federal
budget  trend  of  the  past  decade  for  this  account  continues  for  the  current  fiscal
year. The President’s FY09 request for aeronautics research represents a 28 percent
decline  over  the  appropriated  level  of  FY08,  which  in  turn  was  30  percent  lower
than  the  previous  year.  Over  the  last  ten  years,  funding  for  NASA  Aeronautics  re-
search has declined by some 48 percent, from $1.2B in 1999 to $622M in FY08.

The U.S. is down to one large civil aircraft manufacturer and no longer even par-
ticipates in the regional jet market as a manufacturer. Gulfstream used to be alone
in the market for large cabin business jets. We now have three strong foreign com-
petitors  that  are  intent  on  capturing  our  market.  More  importantly,  they  are  keen
on capturing the engine for jobs and economic growth.
So, why is it important for the Federal Government to invest in aeronautics
R&D? A strong aeronautics industrial base provides huge economic value. The aero-
nautics enterprise contribution to jobs, to tax revenues, to favorable balance of trade
is  massive.  The  recent  Executive  Order  establishing  a  National  Aeronautics  R&D
Policy  states:  ‘‘Continued  progress  in  aeronautics,  the  science  of  flight,  is  essential
to  America’s  economic  success  . . .’’  Congress,  in  the  original  creation  of  NASA  in
the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Act  of  1958,  directs  that:  ‘‘Government-spon-
sored  aeronautical  activities  be  conducted  to  contribute  materially  to  specific  objec-
tives, including the following:

technology.’’

The  role  of  federal  investment  in  aeronautics  is  to  advance  U.S.  technological
leadership,  to  lead  innovation,  and  to  develop  advanced  aeronautics  concepts  and
technologies. It is the catalyst for progress.

In  the  past  NASA  Aeronautics  served  as  a  great  source  of  aeronautical  R&D  ef-
forts.  NASA  aeronautical  technology  has  found  its  way  into  the  market  place  in
multiple  forms  and  in  numerous  products.  With  ever  decreasing  budgets,  however,
this  pipeline  is  drying  up.  In  recent  years,  even  vehicle  technology  demonstrations,
a  vital  risk  reduction  link  between  basic  R&D  and  product  application,  have  been
terminated. This has been a substantial blow to maturing aeronautical technologies
and for U.S. companies involved.

Clearly,  our  nation’s  aeronautics  program  needs  a  revitalization  effort  to  address

our existing priorities and the insufficient aeronautics research funding.
How  do  we  ensure  NASA’s  aeronautics  program  is  relevant?  In  making
NASA aeronautics more relevant to our nation’s needs, the following considerations
are put forth:

working

• A  tacit  understanding  that  the  status  quo,  with  ever  reducing  budgets,  isn’t
• NASA  aeronautics  needs  to  work  beyond  just  ‘‘fundamentals’’  and  needs  to
• Public-private  funding  participation  needs  to  be  balanced  along  more  equi-

take a continuing role in technology demonstration

table conditions

As  an  example,  a  recent  viewpoint  article  in  a  well-respected  trade  publication
stated that government versus private expenditures for all U.S. R&D have virtually
reversed themselves over the past 45 years. In 1964, the government funded 64 per-
cent of all R&D—by 2006, industry funded some 66 percent of the total, or roughly
$220 billion in R&D funding.

The following points offer some specifics:

• NextGen Research Needs

NASA  and  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  are  coordinating  research
to  help  implement  the  Next  Generation  Air  Traffic  Control  System,  known  as
NextGen,  which  will  use  satellite  technology  to  increase  capacity  and  efficiency
within  the  airspace.  Since  NextGen  is  scheduled  for  completion  by  2020—when  air
traffic  is  expected  to  double—it  is  essential  that  Congress  provide  NASA  with  ade-
quate  funding  now  so  that  it  can  meet  its  research  obligations  over  the  next  ten
years.

Specifically, NASA’s Aeronautics budget should be increased to help fund research

into:

– Airspace management
– Reduced separation/vortex wake alleviation
– High density arrival technology
– Roles of air traffic controllers, automated decision-making and conflict resolu-

tion

• Environmental Research Needs

NASA  research  has  produced  advances  in  engine  and  airframe  performance  that
have  helped  reduce  emissions  and  lower  noise.  These  efforts  need  to  be  enhanced
and  expanded.  NASA  research  should  also  be  focused  around  the  development  of:

– Alternative low carbon life cycle aviation fuels
– Methods  to  make  more  efficient  use  of  airspace  that  will  help  reduce  emis-
sions,  including  Continuous  Descent  Approaches  and  improved  in-flight  re-
planning capabilities

– New methods to reduce noise, specifically with regard to supersonic flights

• Aviation Safety Research Needs

NASA  plays  a  critical  role  in  developing  important  safety  enhancing  technologies
including  infrastructure  needed  for  FAA  and  industry  aircraft  certification.  Key
areas  of  focus  should  include  complex  hardware  and  software  certification,  human/
automation interface, and aircraft separation management.

38

How  can  NASA  work  most  effectively  with  industry  and  the  universities?
To  work  effectively  with  industry  and  universities  NASA  needs  to  play  to  their
strengths  and  interests.  NASA  has  repeatedly  developed  aeronautical  technology
plans  and  road  maps  for  high  priority  research  subjects  of  national  interest.  These
road maps need to lead to companies and universities with appropriate interest and
expertise. These roadmaps need to turn into aeronautical R&D Programs up to and
including  large  scale  demonstrations.  These  programs  need  to  satisfy  both  NASA
and company or university objectives . . . and they need to be funded. NASA needs
to provide significant funding to assure innovation, to assure risk reduction, and to
assure  broad  dissemination  of  results.  In  order  to  enable  broad  participation  of  in-
terested  companies,  enhanced  contracting  policies  need  to  admit  commercial  prac-
tices.
What role should NASA play in opening new flight regimes? On the question
of  opening  new  flight  regimes,  NASA  should  be  leading  the  way.  Frankly,  what
more  important  leadership  role  can  NASA  Aeronautics  have?  As  I  mentioned  ear-
lier,  we  have  not  yet  achieved  successful  civil  supersonic  transportation.  Successful
in  this  context  means  technically,  environmentally,  and  economically  successful.  To
make  the  leap  to  a  substantial  transportation  speed  increase,  new  environmental
and safety standards are needed. Aeronautical technology improvements are needed.
Technology demonstrations are needed. This is what NASA Aeronautics has histori-
cally excelled in and should continue to excel in. The risk reduction and barrier re-
moval  R&D  focused  on  new  flight  regimes  is  a  strong  inducement  for  commercial
growth,  jobs  creation,  and  protecting  the  national  aeronautics  leadership  position.

Recommendations and Closing Remarks

As the Subcommittee continues its very important work in producing a NASA Re-

authorization Bill, I wish to leave you with the following recommendations:

(1) That  the  budget  for  NASA’s  Aeronautics  Directorate  be  increased  for  FY09
to $700M—this would constitute nearly an $80M increase over the approved
FY08  level.  Further,  this  increase  would  support  the  2005  National  Acad-
emy  of  Sciences  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  which  rec-
ommended  an  increase  by  at  least  ten  percent  annually  to  keep  America’s
economy competitive.

(2) Re-establishment  of  NASA  Aeronautics  as  a  vital  R&D  activity  supporting

a broad group of U.S. aeronautics companies.

(3) Enhance  NASA  Aeronautics  procurement  policies  to  allow  commercial  con-

tracting practices.

(4) U.S.  Government  action  to  minimize  foreign  competitor  advantages  due  to

strong financial aid.

(5) Separation  of  the  aeronautics  activity  out  of  the  space  agency  as  a  means

to implement a strong aeronautics R&D policy.

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, I thank you
for  the  opportunity  to  express  these  views  on  what  we  believe  to  be  important  to
our future. I look forward to your questions.

SITY
Dr. KROO. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank
you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  NASA’s  aeronautics  research
program.

I  teach  at  Stanford  University  and  conduct  research  related  to
future  aeronautical  concepts.  My  familiarity  with  NASA’s  research
program  comes  from  continuing  interactions  during  my  career  at
Stanford  and  participation  in  several  studies  by  the  National  Re-
search Council including the Decadal Study of Civil Aeronautics in
2006.

I  will  focus  my  comments  on  three  questions  suggested  by  the
Committee.  The  first  question  was,  what  are  the  most  important
challenges  to  be  addressed  if  the  Nation  is  to  sustain  an  efficient,
environmentally  compatible  and  safe  aviation  system  and  what
should  NASA’s  role  be  in  addressing  these  challenges.  Well,  as
noted  by  my  colleagues  and  the  Chair,  the  Nation’s  air  transpor-
tation  system  has  been  a  critical  engineer  for  our  economy  and
quality  of  life  for  many  decades.  Commercial  aircraft  have  made
dramatic  improvements  in  cost,  safety  and  efficiency  over  the  last
50  years.  However,  the  growing  global  demand  for  air  travel  and
the impact of this growth on the environment have led us to a crit-
ical point in the evolution of aviation.

Even today, system capacity limitations, the cost of fuel and local
environmental  impact  are  clear  problems.  It  will  certainly  not  be
possible  to  sustain  an  acceptable  system  in  the  future  without  sig-
nificant  technical  advances.  The  greatest  challenge  will  be  to  ac-
commodate  the  anticipated  growth  in  air  travel  without  increas-
ingly problematic global and local environmental impact.

This  is  not  just  a  regulatory  problem.  It  requires  long-term  re-
search and development of new technologies spanning multiple dis-
ciplines. In many ways, NASA is ideally positioned to address these
problems. No other agency or industry has the experience and tools
to both study the impact of aviation on the global environment and
to  develop  technologies  that  may  be  needed  in  the  future  aircraft
engine,  airframes  and  air  traffic  management  systems.  Unfortu-
nately,  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  is  great  and  growing,  and
NASA’s aeronautics program is not.

This  brings  us  to  the  second  question.  The  adverse  impact  of
aviation on the environment has long been a concern and that con-
cern has recently expanded to include the impact of aviation on cli-

mate.  What  are  the  most  promising  R&D  avenues  for  addressing
these  concerns  and  what  should  NASA’s  R&D  priorities  be  in  this
area?  Well,  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  environmental  impact,  com-
mercial  aviation  can  be  considered  a  real  success  story.  A  few  dec-
ades  ago,  fuel  usage  per  passenger  mile  was  about  70  percent
greater  than  it  is  today.  A  flight  across  the  country  in  a  new  737
now requires only about 29 gallons of gasoline or kerosene per per-
son,  and  that  is  about  80  passenger  miles  per  gallon.  Unfortu-
nately,  the  trouble  is  that  trillions  of  passenger  miles  are  flown
each  year  and  that  traffic  is  expected  to  double  over  the  next  20
years.  So  although  aviation  currently  accounts  for  two  to  four  per-
cent  of  human  CO2 emissions,  its  impact  on  the  environment  may
be much greater in the future due to this projected growth, pollut-
ants other than CO2 and the disproportionate effect of emissions at
high  altitudes.  Local  and  regional  environmental  effects  such  as
airport  community  and  local  air  quality  will  also  be  aggravated  by
the projected increase in air travel.

So in order to achieve a sustainable aviation system while accom-
modating  increasing  demand,  dramatic  improvements  in  aircraft
efficiency  are  required.  Unfortunately,  most  of  the  easy  steps  have
already been taken and further advances require research into bet-
ter  modeling  and  design  capabilities,  new  configuration  concepts,
improved flight management systems and alternative fuels that are
well  suited  to  aviation  use.  Many  uncertainties  also  remain  in  the
effects of aviation on the atmosphere, and research is also required
to  determine  just  how  to  minimize  the  impact  of  air  travel  in  the
future.  Specific  aggressive  but  rational  targets  for  aircraft  noise
and emissions should guide the research priorities for NASA. Goals
such  as  those  described  in  the  National  Plan  for  Aeronautics  R&D
published  last  December  are  clearly  affecting  NASA’s  research
plans, but cutting fuel consumption and noise by 50 percent is very
difficult and it is not clear that this can be achieved with the Agen-
cy’s current resources.

So  what  does  NASA  need  to  do  so  that  its  aeronautics  R&D  ac-
tivities can be effectively transitioned to the public sector? Well, in
the past few years, NASA has done a good job in defining a strong
fundamental research program within severely limiting budget con-
straints.  It  has  focused  R&D  activities  on  the  kind  of  fundamental
research that will be important for longer-term solutions, but if the
goal  is  to  actually  create  a  future  system  that  will  work,  not  just
write  great  research  papers,  much  more  is  needed.  The  next  step
is  to  understand  how  some  of  the  most  promising  technologies  can
be  integrated  at  the  system  level  and  transitioned  from  the  lab  to
the  user.  These  critical  integration  and  validation  projects  will  re-
quire close collaboration with industry but it is difficult to see how
they  can  be  undertaken  with  NASA’s  current  level  of  investment
in aeronautics.

Again,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the  opportunity  to  testify,

and I will be happy to answer questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ILAN KROO

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
testify  on  NASA’s  aeronautics  research  program.  My  name  is  Ilan  Kroo.  I  teach  at
Stanford  University  and  conduct  research  related  to  future  aeronautical  concepts.

My  familiarity  with  NASA’s  research  program  stems  from  work  as  a  civil  servant
at  NASA’s  Ames  Research  Center  twenty  years  ago,  continuing  interactions  with
NASA  during  my  research  career  at  Stanford,  and  participation  in  several  related
studies by the National Research Council, including the Decadal Survey of Civil Aer-
onautics in 2006.

I will focus these comments on NASA’s role in research to improve the safety and
reduce the environmental impact of our future air transportation system, addressing
questions posed in your letter of April 17, 2008.
What do you consider to be the most important challenges to be addressed if the Na-
tion is to sustain an efficient, environmentally compatible, and safe aviation system?
What should NASA’s role be in addressing these challenges?

The Nation’s air transportation system has been a critical engine for our economy
and quality of life for many decades. In terms of cost, safety, and efficiency, commer-
cial  aircraft  have  made  dramatic  improvements  over  the  last  fifty  years.  However,
the growing global demand for air travel, the constraints imposed on system capac-
ity, and the impact of this growth on the environment have led us to a critical point
in the evolution of aviation. Even now, issues with system capacity, the cost of fuel,
and  local  environmental  impact  make  it  clear  that  it  is  not  possible  to  sustain  an
acceptable  system  without  significant  technical  advances.  The  greatest  challenges
will  be  to  accommodate  the  anticipated  two  to  threefold  growth  in  air  travel  over
the next twenty to thirty years without increasingly problematic local and global en-
vironmental  impact.  The  growing  diversity  of  air  vehicles,  from  personal  aircraft
and  light  jets  to  regional  jets  and  very  large  aircraft,  potentially  larger  numbers  of
unmanned  aircraft,  and  even  supersonic  aircraft  make  this  challenge  even  more
complex.  Since  these  long-term  issues  cannot  be  solved  by  regulation  alone  and  re-
quire  the  development  of  technologies  that  span  multiple  industries,  the  critical  re-
search is very appropriate for NASA to undertake. In many ways NASA is uniquely
positioned  to  address  some  of  these  problems.  No  other  agency  or  industry  has  the
expertise and tools to study the impact of aviation on the global environment along
with  technologies  that  may  be  needed  for  future  aircraft  engines,  airframes,  and
traffic  management  systems.  Unfortunately  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  is  great
and growing, while NASA’s aeronautics program is not.
The adverse impact of aviation on the environment has long been a concern, and that
concern has recently expanded to include the impact of aviation on climate. What do
you  consider  to  be  the  most  promising  R&D  avenues  for  addressing  environmental
concerns  associated  with  aviation,  and  what  should  NASA’s  R&D  priorities  be  in
this area?

In  many  ways  commercial  aviation  is  a  success  story  in  terms  of  efficiency  and
environmental  impact.  A  few  decades  ago  fuel  usage  per  passenger  mile  was  about
70 percent greater than it is today and the next generation of aircraft should reduce
fuel  consumption  by  20  percent  compared  with  today’s  aircraft.  A  flight  across  the
country  in  a  Boeing  737–800  requires  only  about  29  gallons  of  fuel  per  person  (a
per-person mileage of about 80 miles per gallon).

However,  trillions  of  passenger-miles  are  flown  each  year  and  traffic  is  expected
to  double  over  the  next  twenty  years.  So,  although  aviation  currently  accounts  for
only  about  two  to  four  percent  of  human  CO2 emissions,  its  impact  on  the  environ-
ment  may  be  much  greater  in  the  future  due  to  this  projected  growth,  pollutants
other than CO2, and the disproportionate effect of emissions deposition at high alti-
tude.  In  order  to  achieve  a  sustainable  aviation  system  while  accommodating  in-
creasing  demand,  dramatic  improvements  in  aircraft  efficiency  are  required.  Unfor-
tunately, most of the easy steps have been taken and further improvements require
research  into  better  modeling  and  design  capabilities,  new  configuration  concepts,
and alternate fuels that are well-suited to aviation use. Many uncertainties remain
about  the  effects  of  aviation  on  the  atmosphere,  and  research  is  required  to  deter-
mine how to minimize the impact of air travel in the future. Nearer-term problems,
aggravated  by  increasing  demand  and  alleviated  with  some  of  the  technology  ad-
vances noted above, include local and regional environmental effects such as airport
community noise and local air quality.

NASA’s  fundamental  research  work  addresses  some  of  these  issues,  but  needs  to
be  expanded  and  focused  on  the  most  promising  technologies  if  it  is  to  contribute
in a significant way to solving these problems. Specific, aggressive, but rational tar-
gets  for  future  aircraft  noise  and  emissions  should  guide  the  research  priorities  for
NASA’s  research.  Challenging  goals  such  as  those  described  in  the  National  Plan
for Aeronautics R&D, published last December are clearly affecting NASA’s research
plans,  but  it  is  not  clear  how  they  can  actually  be  achieved  with  the  Agency’s  cur-
rent resources.

Will  it  be  possible  for  a  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  [NextGen]  to
meet  anticipated  demand  without  incurring  additional  environmental  degradation?
If so, how?

Some of the problems with increasing demand are obvious to travelers today, with
flight  delays  and  cancellations  affecting  the  entire  system.  The  importance  of  im-
proved  air  traffic  management  to  achieve  a  safe  and  efficient  system,  even  as  de-
mand  grows,  is  very  clear.  Perhaps  less  obvious  is  the  role  that  future  traffic  man-
agement systems can play in reducing aviation’s environmental footprint. Exploiting
recent  advances  in  reliable  precision  navigation  to  guide  aircraft  on  routes  that
produce  less  noise,  consume  less  fuel,  or  even  to  avoid  regions  with  more  sensitive
atmospheric  conditions  may  minimize  both  local  and  global  environmental  effects.
Increased  vehicle  autonomy  can  enable  real-time  re-planning  and  more  optimal
flight paths without increasing pilot workload or compromising safety. NASA’s fun-
damental work in this area is important but needs to progress to the next steps in-
volving  larger  scale  experiments  and  validation.  Furthermore,  although  improved
management  of  traffic  is  necessary  in  a  next  generation  air  transportation  system,
this alone will not be sufficient to meet the stringent environmental constraints that
we  expect  in  the  future.  Part  of  NASA’s  work  in  NextGen  must  be  to  combine  new
vehicle concepts that achieve unprecedented efficiency levels, with a traffic manage-
ment  system  that  can  properly  accommodate  legacy  aircraft  and  advanced  designs
that  may  fly  at  different  altitudes  and  speeds.  This  has  been  recognized  within
NASA, but must be emphasized.
What does NASA need to do so that its aeronautics R&D activities can be effectively
and more rapidly transitioned to the marketplace or to the public sector users, as the
case may be?

In the past few years NASA has done a good job in defining a strong, fundamental
research  program  within  severely-limiting  budget  constraints.  It  has  focused  R&D
activities on the kind of fundamental research that will be important for longer-term
solutions.  The  next  step  is  to  understand  how  some  of  the  most  promising  tech-
nologies  can  be  integrated  at  the  system  level  and  transitioned  from  the  lab  to  the
user.  These  critical  integration  and  validation  projects  will  require  close  collabora-
tion with industry and it is difficult to see how they can be undertaken with NASA’s
current level of investment in aeronautics.

Again, thank you Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify.

DISCUSSION

ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR NASA AERONAUTICS

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Kroo.
At  this  point  we  want  to  move  right  to  our  first  round  of  ques-
tions.  I  am  going  to  recognize  myself  for  five  minutes,  and  I  want
to turn back to our final witness, Dr. Kroo.

Each of you, with the exception of Dr. Shin, who is being a loyal
representative  of  the  Administration,  has  highlighted  the  negative
impacts of the declining NASA aeronautics budget. If NASA’s aero-
nautics  program  were  to  be  given  a  higher  level  of  funding  on  a

sustained basis, not just a one-year infusion of cash but on a higher
baseline funding level, by this Congress or the next Administration,
what  would  be  the  most  productive  uses  for  that  additional  fund-
ing?  What  do  you  consider  to  be  the  most  important  priorities  to
pursue?  Maybe  we  can  move  from  my  right  to  my  left,  starting
with Dr. Kroo.

Dr. KROO. Well, as I mentioned, I believe that the issue of future
technologies  for  reducing  environmental  impact  are  some  of  the
most  important  areas  for  NASA  to  be  working  on,  and  if  given  a
larger  budget,  NASA  needs  to  proceed  from  the  kind  of  funda-
mental  research  that  they  are  doing  very  well  to  more  research
that  can  be  used  by  the  industry  to  actually  achieve  some  of  the
goals  that  have  been  stated.  So  progressing  from  fundamental  re-
search  to  integration,  system-level  research  and  validation  experi-
ments and research work is a critical aspect of that.

Chairman UDALL. I will move to Mr. Henne. You have advocated,
what,  an  $80  million  or  so  increase  over  last  year’s  approval  level.
What  critical  research  projects  would  you  target  with  that  in-
crease? You have to turn your microphone on, if you would.

Mr.  HENNE.  Sorry.  I  think  you  have  some  goals  of  the  country
with  the  environmental  impact,  with  NextGen,  with  safety,  and
frankly, those should be the outcomes. What needs to happen is an
investment  in  advanced  technology  and  advanced  concepts.  It  is
with the vehicles you are going to achieve the improvements in the
environment,  the  improvements  in  safety,  the  improvement  in  the
ATC  operation.  It  has  to  come  from  the  vehicles.  And  so  my  look
at that would be, we need to do more in advanced concepts and ve-
hicle technology.

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Meade, would you care to comment?
Mr.  MEADE.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman.  Our  committee  was  asked  to
specifically  concentrate  on  the  decadal  survey  so  with  respect  to
that  framework,  I  would  like  to  answer  that.  I  think  if  you  read
our  report,  what  you  will  find  is  that  concentration  and  fuel  effi-
ciencies  and  NextGen  enablers  would  be  at  the  top  of  the  list  in
addition  to  all  of  the  safety  efforts  within  the  decadal  survey,  the
51 challenges, and those safety efforts come down to basically colli-
sion avoidance, wake turbulence and weather avoidance.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Shin?
Dr.  SHIN.  Well,  I  couldn’t  agree  more  with  the  other  witnesses’
areas  that  they  are  pointing  out  as  the  current  NASA  program
clearly  indicates  that  we  do  address  those  air  traffic  management,
safety  and  environmental  impact  areas  within  the  budget  that  is
allocated by the President.

NASA AND NEXTGEN

Chairman UDALL. Let me move to NextGen, if I might, and I am
not  going  to  get  all  of  these  questions  tied  to  NextGen  in  but  we
would have a couple of rounds.

Dr. Shin, speaking of NextGen, are you satisfied that the connec-
tion  between  the  aeronautics  R&D  and  the  JPDO’s  research  and
development  plan,  integrated  work  plan  is  clear  enough  and  is  it
a  level  of  detail  that  allows  NASA  researchers  to  establish  work
priorities that will result in the timely delivery of NextGen’s capa-
bilities?

44

Dr.  SHIN.  I  believe  the  JPDO  has  evolved  significantly,  both  in
terms  of  scope  and  quality  of  the  documents  they  have  been  gen-
erated, and in particular last year all the member agencies worked
very closely along with JPDO to generate several seminal planning
documents. Because the nature of the work that JPDO is trying to
embark  and  coordinate,  it  is  a  daunting  task,  trying  to  revolu-
tionize  the  Nation’s  air  transportation  system,  not  just  from  air
traffic management perspective but as I mentioned in my oral tes-
timony, as a whole system. It is expected that such documents will
take  some  time  to  have  necessary  depth  and  accuracy  and  clarity,
so I think JPDO has been working diligently on that and NASA is
heavily and very proactively participating in the development of all
those documents.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Shin.  I  am  going  to  return  to
this  in  the  next  round  of  questions  but  at  this  point  I  would  like
to recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Feeney, for five minutes.

Mr. FEENEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also was interested in

the progress of NextGen.

Mr. Meade, with respect to the seven areas where you discovered
major  deficiencies  and  the  other  24  that  have  problems,  which  of
those  areas  do  you  think  are  most  critical  that  NASA  can  address
within current budget and which do you think cannot be addressed
with  reform  or  changes  without  additional  funding?  Just  identify
some  of  the  major  ones.  You  said  the  priority  would  be  NextGen
and then safety and environment but can you be more specific?

Mr. MEADE. I could if I could refer to the study itself. There were

51 of those——

Mr. FEENEY. You have a complicated color chart here.
Mr.  MEADE.  As  you  might  imagine,  it  was  fairly  complicated.
Now, I would like to talk a little bit about the seven that we found
major  deficiencies.  Four  of  those  seven,  NASA  was  not  working  on
at  all.  I  mean,  those  were  simply  omitted  from  the  portfolio  of  re-
search  for  various  reasons,  probably  low  priority  or  lack  of  staff  or
whatever.  So  that  was—that  applied  to  four  of  them.  The  other
three——

Mr. FEENEY. For example, unmanned aerial vehicles.
Mr.  MEADE.  That  is  right,  for  example,  and,  you  know,  we  could
turn to that color chart that you have and see which ones are actu-
ally  not  worked  on.  There  are  three  others  that  were  poorly  man-
aged, probably best described as not advancing the state of the art
for various reasons, and so we would recommend that those things
with  the  current  budget  scenario  be  totally  dropped  or  revamped,
and to get to the basis of your question, though, Mr. Feeney, I don’t
think  that  we  are  in  a  position  right  now  to  tell  you  that  this  is
the  top  priority  and  this  is  the  second  priority.  As  you  know,  the
decadal  survey  itself  refused  to  do  that  and  listed  the  top  51  that
they  thought  was  the  most  important.  I  think  what  we  would  rec-
ommend  as  a  committee,  however,  is  that  a  priority  scheme  be  es-
tablished and have NASA itself go in and decide which is the most
important ones to work on.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, they sort of do that every year when they pro-

pose their budget, I assume.

Mr.  MEADE.  They  do,  but  so  far  we  have  not  seen  any  evidence

that they use the decadal survey as any sort of guiding light.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Mr.  Meade,  one  of  the  recommendations  was  that
NASA,  and  I  quote,  ‘‘not  necessarily  include  the  immediate  public
dissemination  of  results  to  potential  foreign  competitors.’’  Mr.
Henne,  you  know,  listed  three  of  his.  I  suspect  there  will  be  more
in the future. Why did your group feel compelled to make this rec-
ommendation?  Is  it  consistent  with  the  practices  of  other  Western
governments  when  they  do  research  and  development?  And  then
maybe  we  will  hear  from  Mr.  Henne  and  he  may  have  an  opinion
on that as well.

Mr. MEADE. I think that comment was—the genesis of that com-
ment began to build in our committee from looking back in the last
50  years  of  aviation  history,  particularly  on  the  1958  law  that
brought  NASA  into  existence,  where,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Mr.
Henne,  in  his  testimony,  quoted  that  one  of  the  purposes  of  NASA
was to make sure that America stayed in the forefront of aviation.
Back then, there were natural inhibitors to the dissemination of in-
formation outside our borders and the feeling of the Committee was
that this——

Mr.  FEENEY.  American  cars  and  airplanes  used  to  be  made  en-

tirely in America back then too. That has changed.

Mr.  MEADE.  Used  to  be,  right,  and  so  we  had  a  very  large  capa-
bility  to  absorb  the  fruits  of  the  labor  of  all  this  research  ahead  of
any  competition.  Well,  Tom  Friedman  was  right,  the  world  is  flat,
and by the way, there are many competitors around the globe now
that  have  just—can  very  quickly  react  to  the  results  of  that  re-
search  and  so  we  have  to  decide  if  the  American  public  is  paying
for  this  very  worthy  research,  that  the  American  public  gain  the
benefit of this research.

RESEARCH INFORMATION

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  real  quickly,  you  made  a  recommendation,  if
they  find  some  quantum  leap  in  capabilities,  should  they  provide
it  to  Mr.  Henne’s  company  that  would  affect,  for  example,  just  the
niche  that  Mr.  Henne  is  in.  Should  they  provide  it  to  Mr.  Henne’s
company but no foreign companies?

Mr.  MEADE.  I  think  that  is  beyond  the  scope  of  what  our  com-
mittee  would  recommend.  However,  this  is  a  competitive  atmos-
phere that everybody operates in.

Mr. FEENEY. Mr. Henne, do you have an opinion about that?
Mr.  HENNE.  That  is  a  difficult  question.  In  terms  of  transfer  of
information, you certainly would like to think that information that
is generated by research funded by the U.S. public advantages U.S.
interests  first.  I  mean,  that  would  be  a  guiding  principle.  But  in
today’s global environment where we have suppliers that are inter-
national,  we  deal  with  international  sales,  that  dividing  line  gets
pretty  hard  to  define  in  reality  and  so  you  would  like  policies  that
advantage U.S. interests. If it becomes crippling, then it doesn’t do
anybody any good.

Mr.  FEENEY.  I  will  have  some  more  questions  if  we  get  to  a  sec-

ond round. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman  UDALL.  The  Chair  recognizes  the  Chairman  of  the
Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, the Member from Or-
egon, Mr. Wu.

AVIATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Kroo,  your  testimony  had  some  interesting  comments  about
environmental  effects  of  aviation  and  I  wanted  to  focus  on  a  par-
ticular  environment  effect  which  is  not  addressed  in  your  testi-
mony, and that is noise pollution. There is an interesting article in
Aviation Week this week about helicopter rotor blades which make
less  noise.  When  I  was  either  a  freshman  or  sophomore,  we  no
longer  have  the  benefit  of  Mr.  Weiner  on  this  committee  but  he
would  ask  very  pointed  questions  about  the  next  generation  of  jet
engine  technology  that  would  be  more  quiet.  It  is  my  impression
that whether it is from a research or more likely from a regulatory
point  of  view,  the  Europeans  have  taken  the  lead  in  quieter  en-
gines. Are we putting enough research emphasis on noise pollution,
in your view, and can you discuss that for us just a little bit?

Dr.  KROO.  Sure.  There  are  two  kinds  of  goals,  one  that  may  be
addressed  with  regulatory  issues,  which  are  near-term  goals,  and
then there are the goals that apply for a longer-term over the next
couple of decades. Certainly some of the near-term goals can be ad-
dressed with regulation and in next generation designs of airplanes
but  in  the  future,  rather  dramatic  changes  in  noise  of  aircraft  are
possible  and  are  consistent  with  some  of  the  other  environmental
goals so that as airplanes become more efficient, they don’t just re-
quire more acoustic treatment on engines but the engines can actu-
ally  be  smaller.  They  can  have  less  jet  noise  on  takeoff  and  there-
fore airplanes designed with the environmental impact in mind can
really be dramatically quieter.

Mr. WU. That is 20, 30 years out.
Dr. KROO. So the goal of the European framework research is to
achieve  half  the  noise  by  2020,  half  the  average  noise.  This  is  not
inconsistent  with  some  of  the  R&D  aeronautics  goals  that  have
been  provided  quite  recently  in  this  country.  That  would  make  a
dramatic  difference.  Having  a  lot  more  traffic  would  also  make  a
dramatic difference, and we have to figure out how to accommodate
that.

WIND TUNNELS

Mr. WU. Right, cutting the noise in half dramatically changes the
noise footprint on the ground. Let me ask you a question about the
research  infrastructure.  One  of  your  colleagues  at  Stanford  was
very,  very  concerned  a  few  years  ago,  I  believe  about  the  number
of  wind  tunnels  available  for  research  here  in  the  United  States.
In your view, has that situation gotten better or worse?

Dr.  KROO.  That  situation  is  somewhat  better.  The  Air  Force,  for
example, has stepped up to fund some of the facilities in this coun-
try  such  as  the  national  full-scale  facility,  the  80  by  120  foot  wind
tunnel  located  at  NASA  Ames.  There  are  many  wind  tunnels  that
are continually closing down, being refurbished only not to be used
in  this  country,  and  this  is  a  difficult  situation.  We  still  go  to  Eu-
rope to do wind tunnel testing, and that is a problem.

Mr. WU. Mr. Henne, do you see going to Europe to use their wind

tunnels as a problem?

47

Mr.  HENNE.  Let  me—that  is  a  fascinating  question  for  me  be-
cause we just completed a whole series of development wind tunnel
tests  on  a  new  aircraft  model,  the  last  one  being  the  most  impor-
tant, most expensive, and it was done in Europe.

Mr. WU. Do you see that as a problem?
Mr.  HENNE.  Yes,  it  is,  because  you  have  to  believe,  you  have  to
walk out of that tunnel believing that your data is available to oth-
ers.

Mr. WU. Dr. Kroo, would you agree with that assessment?
Dr. KROO. I think so. I do think that some of the facilities really
are  very  good  in  Europe  and  we  should  take  advantage  of  it  but
it  is  indeed  always  a  question.  I  have  to  say  with  respect  to  keep-
ing some of that data in the United States and with respect to the
previous  Member’s  question,  it  is  a  difficult  question.  One  has  to
walk that line between——

Mr. WU. Dr. Kroo, I don’t mean to cut you off but I am going to.
Dr. KROO. That is fine.
Mr. WU. Dr. Shin, how did NASA let the situation develop where
Mr.  Henne’s  data  is  going  to  be  used  by  folks  who  didn’t  pay  for
it?

Dr.  SHIN.  To  that  very  specific  issue,  NASA  aeronautics  has  es-
tablished  a  program  called  Aeronautics  Test  Program  a  few  years
ago and——

Mr. WU. But it doesn’t seem to be working.
Dr. SHIN. Well, in the past, there has been some issues with the
maintaining and up-keeping the NASA wind tunnels so that is why
we established this program, and we are making good progress. We
are also working with our partners in DOD so——

Mr.  WU.  So  Dr.  Shin,  if  we  hold  this  hearing  again  in  two  years
or  in  one  year,  will  you  have  a  different  answer  for  Mr.  Henne?
Will you have a solution for Mr. Henne?

Dr. SHIN. We are certainly working toward that goal
Mr.  WU.  Are  you  working  toward  it  or  will  you  have  a  solution

for Mr. Henne?

Dr. SHIN. We will do our best.
Mr. WU. Thank you.

NOISE AND AVIATION

Mr.  HENNE.  Mr.  Congressman,  I  wonder  if  I  could  make  a  shot
at  the  first  question  you  asked,  and  that  was  about  investment  in
noise.  I  don’t  believe  that  we,  the  United  States,  are  investing
enough  in  it  and  I  brought  two  exhibits  if  you  are  interested.  One
is  the  CLEEN  program,  as  provided—some  information  provided
both by the FAA and NASA, and if you read it, it is a program pro-
posed  to  spend  up  to  $20  million  a  year  for  four,  five  years,  up  to
$20  million  a  year  for  four  or  five  years.  This  is  at  the  same  time
that  the  announced  program  by  the  European  Commission  is  $1.6
billion  euro  for  seven  years,  which  means  $2.4  billion  on  the  same
subject,  and  so  it  is  an  order  of  magnitude  larger  investment  in
clean  technology  that  is  being  made  in  Europe  compared  to  the
United States, an order of magnitude.

Mr. WU. I thank you for calling that to our attention.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.

R&D AND NEXTGEN

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  We  will  start  another  round  and
the  Chair  recognizes  himself  for  five  minutes.  I  want  to  pick  back
up  on  NextGen  and  turn  to  Mr.  Meade.  In  the  area  of  advanced
communication, navigation and surveillance, your committee found
that  NASA’s  aerospace  efforts  didn’t  have  planned  research  to  ad-
dress their R&D milestones as identified in the recent decadal sur-
vey.  Since  the  NextGen  concept  seems  to  rely  extensively  on  those
capabilities being available, should we be concerned?

Mr.  MEADE.  If  I  heard  your  question  correctly,  Mr.  Chairman,  I
think we should be concerned. We evaluated the milestones against
what  we  thought  would  be  a  rational  program  and  found  defi-
ciencies in those sensor areas and so NextGen depends upon those
sensors  and  the  integration  of  those  sensors  within  the  aerospace
systems  and  I  would  say  that  that  would  be  a  high-priority  item.

NASA AERONAUTICS AND TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION

Chairman UDALL. Does anybody else care to comment?
Let  me  move  to  Mr.  Henne  then.  In  your  testimony,  you  state
that  NASA  aeronautics  needs  to  work  beyond  just  fundamentals
and  needs  to  take  a  continuing  role  in  technology  demonstration,
and  then  Dr.  Kroo,  you  stated  in  your  testimony  that  NASA  has
focused  R&D  activities  on  the  kind  of  fundamental  research  that
will be important for longer-term solutions. The next step is to un-
derstand how some of the most promising technologies can be inte-
grated  at  the  system  level  and  transitioned  form  the  lab  to  the
user. It seems to me that both of you are saying that NASA needs
to  be  more  than  fundamental  or  basic  research  if  it  is  to  be  rel-
evant to the Nation’s needs. Is that correct?

Mr. HENNE. That is correct. Those two statements are very simi-
lar  in  reality.  One  of  the  things  that  seems  to  have  dried  up  is
large-scale demonstrations of technology. Those are the things that
reduce  the  risk,  that  give  companies  confidence  in  fact  that  the
technology is mature enough to take to market, and when that link
is  dropped  because  it  is  expensive,  it  costs  a  lot  to  do  those  kind
of  demonstrations,  when  that  is  dropped,  you  have  broken  the
chain.  The  technology  isn’t  going  to  advance.  It  is  going  to  stay  in
the  lab,  it  is  going  to  stay  in  the  office  and  it  will  be  a  small-scale
study  going  on  and  on  and  on  and  progressing  it  to  the  market
won’t happen.

Chairman  UDALL.  Dr.  Kroo,  I  see  you  nodding.  Would  you  have

ment?

an example as well of opportunities that might be missed——

Dr. KROO. Well, absolutely, and I think that it is often tempting
to think of these as demonstrations but in fact they are also experi-
ments.  These  kind  of  system-level  research  activities  let  you  know
what you don’t know, and that is very important in this area.

Chairman  UDALL.  Mr.  Meade,  Dr.  Shin,  would  you  care  to  com-

Mr. MEADE. I fully support it. One of the ideas that we came up
with on the Committee was the fact that—or realizations, I should
say,  was  the  fact  that  there  are  very  few  flight  experiments  any
longer  for  a  couple  of  reasons.  Everybody  is  afraid  of  failure,  and
once  you  get  in  the  air,  there  is  always  a  chance,  particularly  as

you are advancing the state of the art, that it won’t work, and that
somehow  is  a  negative  mark  on  somebody’s  career  and  therefore
there is a tendency to avoid those steps. And there is an intangible
result from actually getting out into the field and flying something,
and  that  is,  you  invigorate  an  entire  generation  of  people  who
would like to come study in the avionics field, or I should say aero-
nautics field. So there is a tremendous benefit in making that user
connection and also energizing the system.

Chairman  UDALL.  Dr.  Shin,  I  would  want  to  give  you  an  oppor-

tunity to comment.

Dr.  SHIN.  Yes.  I  do  recognize  that  we  do  not  have  large-scale
technology demonstration or validation efforts, as Mr. Henne point-
ed out, so that is accurate statement, but I also like to submit that
in  current  NASA  aeronautics  portfolio,  we  do  sizable  amount  of
flight experiments and working with industry and so those are not
in  the  traditional  sense  large-scale,  highly  integrated  flight  valida-
tion  efforts  but  we  do  work,  as  an  example,  blended  wing  body
flight  experiments  that  we  are  still  conducting  and  also  we,  as  a
matter  of  fact,  worked  with  Gulfstream  on  the  sonic  boom  mitiga-
tion technology. That was done through flight experiments as well.
So  again,  within  the  budget  that  has  been  allocated  to  us,  we  do
believe  we  try  to  maintain  the  relevance  with  industry  and  also
conducting flight experiments.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  hear  implied  in  your  comments,  though,  if
we  were  able  to  find  more  resources,  there  is  certainly  more  than
you could do in your directorate.

Dr.  SHIN.  I  think  we  are—actually,  NASA  aeronautics  and  aero-
nautics community as a whole are in a good situation actually com-
pared  to  previous  years  because  we  do  have  this  national  aero-
nautics R&D policy and plan that will guide us, government agency
like  NASA,  to  set  the  right  priorities  so  we  will  continue  to  work
within  that  plan  and  policy  and  make  sure  that  our  program  is
well aligned.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  and  the  Chair  recognizes  the

Ranking Member, Mr. Feeney, for five minutes.

Mr. FEENEY. Thank you.

NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL ASSESSMENT OF NASA R&D

ACTIVITIES

Dr. Shin, the National Research Council’s assessment of NASA’s
aeronautics  R&D  recommended  that,  and  I  will  quote,  ‘‘The  Aero-
nautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  should  ensure  that  its  re-
search  program  substantially  advances  the  state  of  the  art  and
makes a significant difference in a time frame of interest to users.’’
They go on to recommend that NASA, in consultation with the aer-
onautics research community and others as appropriate, should re-
define the scope and priorities within the aeronautics research pro-
gram  to  be  consistent  with  available  resources.  So  they  essentially
suggest  that  there  needs  to  be  some  fundamental  redefinitions  of
priorities  and  additionally,  as  Mr.  Meade  stated  earlier,  they  sug-
gested  there  may  be  a  cultural  problem  with  respect  to  the  lack  of
urgency  and  a  view  towards  who  the  end  user  is  as  opposed  to
NASA  using  the  technology,  the  end  user.  How  do  you  respond  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:39 Oct 11, 2008 Jkt 041902 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\050108\41902 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

50

the  National  Research  Council’s  assessment  and  Mr.  Meade’s  sug-
gestion?

Dr. SHIN. I generally agree with the essence of the recommenda-
tion,  which  points  out  that  NASA  aeronautics  should  be  staying
relevant  and  sort  of  being  up  on  the  U.S.  industry  and  U.S.  aero-
nautics  community,  and  for  the  past  almost  19  years  that  I  have
been  with  NASA  aeronautics,  I  have  always  thought,  and  my  col-
leagues  have  always  worked  to  address  U.S.  aeronautics  commu-
nity requirements and needs. So if there are some pockets of areas
or groups of researchers who feel that NASA aeronautics is serving
to  our  own  need,  that  is  something  that  I  must  correct  and  that
is  not  what  NASA  aeronautics  is  all  about.  We  don’t  produce  our
own  aircraft  or  we  don’t  serve  to  our  own  outcome.  So  again,  in
general,  I  respect  NRC’s  observation  and  recommendation,  so  if
there are cases like that, we will certainly work to remedy that.

In  terms  of  staying  relevant,  we  are  making  all  efforts  because
we  invite  industry  partners  to  our  annual  technical  interchange
meetings that all three research programs have, and so far we have
had  one  or  two  of  those  such  meetings  since  we  restructured  the
aeronautics  program,  and  I  have  gotten—and  I  have  also  partici-
pated in some of those meetings, have gotten a lot of healthy inter-
actions, so tech transfer or knowledge transfer should happen at all
levels, that is my belief, not just at the end of the rope when every-
thing  is  culminated  to  some  large-scale  validation.  So  we  have  to
work  with  industry  partners  and  academia  up  front  and  all  along
the  technology  development  so  we  actually  identify  the  transition
point  jointly  rather  than  NASA  decides  this  is  the  point  that  we
have  to  transfer  the  technology.  So  by  doing  some  of  these  things
and  focusing  on  what  we  do  best,  NASA  aeronautics  does  best,  I
believe  we  can  make  still  significant  contributions  in  staying  rel-
evant to U.S. needs.

Mr.  FEENEY.  You  just  mentioned  your  academic  partners.  Dr.
Kroo  is  here.  Also,  you  know,  for  example,  adjacent  to  my  district
is  Embry-Riddle  University,  which  has  a  keen  interest  in  aero-
nautics.  What—can  you  describe  NASA’s  cooperation  and  use  of
academic  researchers?  Because  it  appears  to  me  that  would  be  a
place  where  cutting-edge,  futuristic,  you  know,  research  is  the
norm,  and  if  you  want  to  stay  not  just  current  but  ahead  of  the
curve,  academia  seems  to  be,  you  know,  an  important  part  of  that
whole program.

Dr.  SHIN.  I  wholeheartedly  agree  with  your  view  toward
academia’s  role  in  our  nation,  and  to  that  end,  two  years  ago  we
have set aside, not as an afterthought but we set aside $50 million
out  of  our  annual  budget  to  bolster  and  promote  and  integrate
these  cutting-edge  ideas  and  concepts  coming  from  academia,  and
the  funding  vehicle  is  called  NASA  Research  Announcement,  in
short,  NRA.  NRA  is  a  very  flexible  procurement  vehicle  so  it
doesn’t  only  allow  grants,  it  could  be  cooperative  agreements  or
contract  even.  The  participants  are  not  only  universities  but  the
idea of NRA is exactly what Mr. Feeney mentioned, to promote and
bring  out  these  cutting-edge  ideas  and  concepts,  and  I  am  happy
to  report  for  about  a  year  and  a  half  that  we  started  doing  this,
we  have  received  over  1,300  proposals  and  we  have  awarded  over
300  recipients  through  NRA  process,  and  the  market  for  the  par-

ticipants is growing and also spanning not just from academia and
also  industry.  So  today,  again,  I  am  happy  to  report  that  we  have
about  30  percent  industry  participation  and  70  percent  university
in  terms  of  number  of  awards,  but  in  terms  of  funding,  40  percent
industry  and  60  percent  academia.  So  one  of  the  gratifying  things
through  NRA  that  I  have  observed  is  some  of  these  small  univer-
sities or universities that we never really thought traditionally that
they would have aeronautics expertise, we are getting a lot of these
non-traditional  engineering  powerhouses,  if  you  will,  and  a  lot  of
good  ideas  and  concepts.  So  it  is  solely  based  on  the  quality  of  the
proposal  and  we  are  making  good  progress  and  I  have  been  very
pleased with the progress we have been making.

Chairman UDALL. I thank the gentleman.
I now would like to recognize one of the most active Members of
this subcommittee, the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Rothman.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Thank  you.  I  want  to  thank  our  distinguished
Chairman  and  the  Ranking  Member  for  holding  this  very  impor-
tant  hearing  and  for  your  consistent  and  strong  interest  in  these
matters,  and  I  apologize  for  being  late,  gentlemen,  I  had  another
place to be, but I am very interested in this subject.

NOISE AND AIRCRAFT POLLUTION

Let  me  ask  Mr.  Meade—I  have  a  few  questions.  I  represent  a
densely populated region in the most densely populated state in the
country.  So  aircraft  noise  and  aircraft  pollution  are  constant  con-
cerns  for  the  quality  of  life  of  my  constituents.  I  believe  that  aero-
nautics  research  and  development  creating  quieter,  safer,  cleaner
aircraft  is  an  important  aspect  in  dealing  with  the  quality-of-life
issues  my  constituents  deal  with  on  a  daily  basis.  So  Mr.  Meade,
what can this committee do to help NASA achieve these important
goals?

Mr. MEADE. Well, I think as far as our committee, from the NRC
is  concerned,  we  would  recommend  that  the  decadal  survey  be  fol-
lowed  with  regard  to  the  environmental  challenges  that  they  have
already specified and so I think the best and shortest answer I can
give  you  is,  take  a  look  at  the  decadal  survey  and  direct  NASA  to
adjust their priorities to respond to those challenges.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Thank you.
Dr.  Shin,  are  you  familiar  with  this  survey  that  Mr.  Meade  has

referred to?

Dr. SHIN. I am.
Mr. ROTHMAN. And has NASA taken into account the conclusions
of that survey in its budget, in its project proposals or plans for the
coming year?

Dr.  SHIN.  Yes.  We  have  made  a  very  thorough  assessment  from
decadal  survey,  and  in  fact,  we  submitted  our  report  to  Congress
a year and a half ago, as I recall. But in the environment area, this
is  one  area  that  NASA  aeronautics  program  actually  has  a  very
strong technology development effort.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Shin, would you pull the microphone a lit-

tle closer again?

Dr.  SHIN.  Yes.  I  keep  doing  that.  For  noise  and  emissions,  these
are the two areas actually we have a very strong portfolio in funda-
mental  aeronautics  program,  and  we  have  made  a  lot  of  progress

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:39 Oct 11, 2008 Jkt 041902 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA08\050108\41902 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

in  developing  new  concepts  and  also  tools  that  will  allow  us  to  as-
sess or develop new technologies.

U.S. R&D AND EUROPEAN R&D

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Dr.  Shin,  if  I  may,  because  I  only  have  a  limited
amount  of  time,  I  was  present  when  Mr.  Henne  suggested  that
there  was  a  large  order  of  magnitude  difference  between  our  in-
vestment  and  the  implication  being  our  work  in  NASA  in  those
areas  as  compared  with  Europe.  Can  you  comment  on  whether
there is this huge order of magnitude difference in either the qual-
ity of the work, the advancements achieved here in America versus
in Europe?

Dr.  SHIN.  I  think  recently  it  is  a  well-known  fact  that  the  Euro-
pean  community  is  trying  to  increase  the  commitment  in  their
funding in aeronautics research and development. So as Mr. Henne
accurately pointed out, the funding is growing there——

Mr. ROTHMAN. But in terms of the technology, you know, just to
make  a  silly  analogy,  if  they  were  still  in  the  Stone  Age  playing
with  the  wheel  and  figuring  out  what  to  do  with  that,  they  would
need a lot more investment to catch up to where we are. Where are
they,  though,  in  technology  with  regards  to  reduction  in  aircraft
noise and aircraft emissions relative to where we are in the United
States,  and  are  they  going  to  pull  ahead  of  us  in  some  dramatic
and  unacceptable  fashion  because  of  the  relatively  smaller  amount
of  research  dollars  that  are  included  in  the  President’s  budget  for
our country?

Dr.  SHIN.  In  short,  my  assessment  is,  we  are  still  far  ahead  of
the  Europeans’  capabilities  and  knowledge  in  addressing  environ-
mental  impact.  I  do  believe  that.  And  Europeans  have  always  cop-
ied, if you will, the goals and objectives that U.S. government agen-
cies  and  also  industry  put  out.  So  that  is  the  one  indication  that
Europeans are trying to catch up.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, do I have time for two more ques-

Mr. Henne, do you have a comment on that, Dr. Shin’s last state-

tions?

ment?

Mr. HENNE. I would say from our assessment of products coming
from  Europe  versus  products  in  the  United  States,  they  are  very
competitive.  Our  most  recent  engine  selection  was  made  selecting
a  Rolls  Royce  engine  that  is  actually  made  in  Germany,  and  it  is
an  excellent  engine,  very  low  noise.  They  are  extremely  sensitive
to low emissions. The engine company recently made an unsolicited
change in the combustor to reduce emissions further, and we didn’t
even ask for it.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Dr.  Shin,  do  you  have  any  comment  on  Mr.

Henne’s last comment?

Dr.  SHIN.  Yes.  I  think  the  difference  in  my  answer  was,  I  was
talking  about  R&D  capabilities  and  I  think  Mr.  Henne’s  answer
was current product line. So that was the difference in my answer.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  But  in  terms  of  the  way  people  live  practically,
theoretical  discussions  of  advancements  in  products  are  valuable
but  if  they  never  reach  the  product  line,  they  really—they  won’t
help  the  quality  of  life  as  directly  as  those  investments  in  product
line research and development. When will we—when will this R&D

in  aircraft  emissions  and  other  emissions  from  aircraft  that  is
being  conducted  by  NASA  bear  the  fruit  of  better  products  if,  as
Mr. Henne says, the products are now equal?

Dr.  SHIN.  Your  observation  is  valid,  and  the  current  U.S.  tech-
nologies  in  noise  and  emissions  reduction  started  from  10,  20,  30
years  ago  from  NASA’s  research.  So  NASA’s  research  has  to  put
ourselves  another  10,  20,  30  years  ago  ahead  of  current  tech-
nologies and that is what we are doing.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND NEXTGEN

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  One  final  question.  I  wanted  to  ask  about,  Dr.
Shin,  NASA’s  role  in  aeronautics  research  and  development  with
regards to NextGen, and I will ask the question, if experts from the
air  traffic  control  community  were  consulted  as  this  system  has
been  developed,  in  other  words,  have  actual  air  traffic  controllers,
the people in the towers who do this work every day, been involved
in the development of this new air transportation system?

Dr.  SHIN.  I  would  like  to—if  I  may,  I  would  like  to  defer  that
question to actually FAA because air traffic controllers and that as-
sociation is not part of NASA. My observation has been that JPDO
and  FAA  have  been  working  closely  with  air  traffic  controllers  as-
sociation  and  that  workforce  but  I  am  not  part  of  that  agency
so——

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  No,  no,  I  didn’t  ask  about  that.  Is  your  answer
then  that  NASA  has  not  involved  the  air  traffic  controllers  in  its
research?

Dr. SHIN. We do heavily work with FAA and JPDO in air traffic

management technology development.

Mr. ROTHMAN. I meant NASA directly with the air traffic control-
lers’  expertise.  Have  you  had  that  direct  communication  or  do  you
rely  on  whatever  FAA  tells  you  their  conversations  with  the  air
traffic controllers have informed them of?

Dr.  SHIN.  I  apologize  for  not  getting  your  question  right  away.
We  do  work  with  air  traffic  controllers.  In  our  research  and  devel-
opment,  we  do  use  air  traffic  controllers  as  observers,  also  partici-
pants in developing our technologies, so we do have that close rela-
tionship,  but  in  terms  of  actual  working  relationship  within  FAA,
we don’t .

. work that way.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Ten  seconds.  You  have  been  so  generous  to  me.
I  just  want  to  make  one  comment  to  industry,  that  I  do  believe

.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Oh,  you  are  so  kind.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Melancon.
I  just  want  to  say,  I  don’t  take  industry  off  the  hook  in  terms  of
its responsibilities to do its own research and development and pay
for it itself. They can’t rely on the government to pay for it all, and
while I respect and appreciate the profit motive and the great work
and  the  great  products  made  by  private  industry  including  great
aircraft,  you  folks  have  some  of  that  burden  as  well  and  you  can’t

industry has——

Chairman UDALL. Mr. Rothman, why don’t we do this? I will rec-
ognize  the  gentleman  from  Louisiana,  Mr.  Melancon,  for  five  min-
utes and he can do whatever he would like with that time.

Mr.  MELANCON.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  yield  my  time  to

Mr. Rothman.

simply say the feds are not picking up the whole tab, so woe is us,
so woe are us.

Thank you, Mr. Melancon, for yielding, and Mr. Chairman again

for your generosity and your leadership as always.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Rothman.  I  would  note  that
between the short time that Mr. Melancon yielded to you, the time
you  took  that  you  had  two-  to  five-minute  blocks  and  you  used
them quite well, and I know I speak on behalf of your constituents
who  admire  and  respect  the  passion  and  intensity  with  which  you
bring  to  discussions  of  sound  pollution  and  air  pollution,  and  you
have  a  very  compelling  case  to  make  because  when  we  get  this
right,  not  only  your  constituents  but  Americans  all  over  the  coun-
try  will  benefit  for  higher  quality  of  life  because  this  is  a  problem
that  concerns  all  of  us.  I  hear  about  it  in  my  district  as  well.  I
thank  the  gentleman  from  Louisiana  for  being  so  generous  as  well
with his time.

Let me turn back to the panel. The Chairman recognizes himself

for another five minutes.

NASA’S AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM

Dr.  Shin,  I  want  to  ask  you  what  you  consider  to  be  the  most
promising  areas  of  research  at  NASA’s  Aviation  Safety  Program
that could lead to new capabilities being in sort of the marketplace
in the next five years, even the next 10 years.

Dr.  SHIN.  Yes.  As  I  mentioned  in  my  testimony,  we  are  enjoying
the  safest  system,  but  we  are  also  changing  a  lot  of—we  will  be
changing a lot of things in air traffic management system and also
introducing  new  vehicle  concepts.  So  when  you  mix  all  those
things,  you  don’t  know  what  kind  of  new  safety  challenges  will  be
ahead  of  us.  So  from  a  NASA  research  perspective,  we  are  trying
to  be  proactive  and  also  forward  looking  utilizing  the  IT  advance-
ments  in  data  mining  and  also  analyzing  and  processing  the  data,
so we are working with FAA closely to develop this aviation safety
information  and  sharing  system  so  automatically  we  can  analyze
the  data  and  identify  the  precursors  before  the  accident  actually
happens. So that is one such area that we are working on and also
in  projected  highly  automated  system  that  we  are  all  anticipating
in  NextGen  vision,  software  validation  and  verification  is  very  im-
portant,  so  we  have  to  work  proactively  to  develop  technologies
that  can  ensure  that  all  the  software  and  automation  are  func-
tioning  as  designed,  so  validation  and  verification  is  another  chal-
lenge.

Chairman  UDALL.  Anybody  else  on  the  panel  care  to  comment?
Mr.  HENNE.  If  I  could,  Mr.  Chairman.  Relative  to  safety,  that  is
clearly  a  very  high  priority  for  our  business,  and  I  would  like  to
point out one example of just excellent work by NASA that has led
to  a  real-world  improvement  in  aviation  safety  that  is  just  now
available,  and  that  deals  with  synthetic  vision.  NASA  has  been
doing synthetic vision work for years and years, and we some time
ago did a joint program with NASA on a Gulfstream to look at syn-
thetic vision. We flew it and learned things that were good, learned
things that were bad. When we were done with that flight test ex-
periment  in  conjunction  with  NASA  work,  we  made  a  decision,  it
is  time  to  go  to  market,  let  us  take  it  to  market.  It  has  now  been

certified.  It  is  now  going  out  in  our  product  line  and  it  is  a  major
advance  in  aircraft  safety,  and  we  are  proud  that  NASA  and  we
were joined together doing that to actually bring that to market in
the end. So there is a lot of good things that NASA generates, they
are  the  source  of.  The  trick  is  to  get  that  technology  developed  all
the  way  and  take  it  to  market,  and  that  is  one  just  great  example
of aviation safety that is now done. It is available.

Chairman  UDALL.  Dr.  Kroo,  Mr.  Meade,  do  you  have  any  com-

ments?

Dr.  KROO.  Just  to  look  at  the  future  area  of  aircraft  safety,  one
of  the  academically  interesting  areas  and  an  area  that  NASA  is
pursuing is the utilization of advances in autonomous systems and
vehicle  autonomy  in  general  to  both  improve  the  safety  of  vehicles
and  to  improve  the  situational  awareness  of  pilots.  That  also  cre-
ates difficulty if in fact there are autonomous vehicles operating in
the  same  airspace.  NASA  is  addressing  that  problem  to  some  ex-
tent. There is a lot more needed.

NAOMS/ASIAS

Chairman UDALL. If I might, Dr. Shin, I would like to turn back
to NASA’s handling of the NAOMS aviation survey project, and as
you all know, the Committee has been concerned. We have a GAO
review  underway  to  look  at  the  survey  data.  I  understand,  how-
ever,  that  NASA  and  the  FAA  are  working  on  another  aviation
safety database activity, and the acronym is ASIAS, I think Ah-SI-
uhs is maybe how it is pronounced, and it involves significant data
mining  and  the  merging  of  multiple  disparate  databases.  As  you
know, the Federal Government doesn’t have a great track record on
the  development  of  such  large  database  management  systems.
What are NASA and yourselves doing to ensure that this latest ef-
fort stays on track and on budget? Furthermore, what are the spe-
cific  objectives,  budget  and  timetable  for  the  ASIAS  project  and
how  are  the  responsibilities  divided  between  the  FAA  and  NASA?
You  could  respond  for  the  record  if  you  would  like.  I  know  I  just
threw a lot of questions at you.

Dr.  SHIN.  Yes.  I  just  want  to  respond  in  real  time  about  ASIAS,
if I may, and the others I would like to provide more detailed infor-
mation for the record, with your permission. In the ASIAS, I think
the  real  positive  aspect  there,  sir,  is  the  participants  and  who  are
actually playing together in this ASIAS effort. It is not just NASA,
it  is  not  just  FAA  working  in  isolation.  It  is  not  just  airlines  hold-
ing their information. The beauty of this system is, airlines are vol-
untarily  providing  their  operational  data,  safety  data,  and  FAA  is
in the lead role to make sure that all the confidentiality and all the
other  considerations  are  protected  so  that  airlines  can  share  their
data,  and  NASA  is  providing  the  necessary  technologies  so  I  go
back  to  one  of  my  earlier  comments  that  the  clearer  each  agency’s
roles  are  identified  and  understood,  I  think  the  better  we  will  be
off  working  together.  So  ASIAS  is  one  such  case  that  FAA  is  the
primarily  regulatory  agency  providing  the  protection  and  NASA  is
the  R&D  organization  providing  necessary  technologies,  and  air-
lines do see the value so they are coming to work together.

Chairman  UDALL.  Let  the  record  note  that  we  say  the  acronym
ASIAS,  and  if  you  all  do  the  job  you  want  to  do,  I  think  it  won’t

be  a  common  parlance.  It  will  be  an  acronym  that  is  only  known
to those who track these important efforts. I appreciate your expla-
nation  there,  and  if  you  want  to  add  additional  material  for  the
record, the Committee would welcome it.

The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman  from  Florida,  Mr.  Feeney,

for five minutes.

Mr. FEENEY. Well, thank you.

NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL PRIORITIES/UAVS

Dr.  Shin,  the  NRC  assessment  indicated,  among  other  things,
that there are about four areas that have been established as a pri-
ority  by  the  decadal  studies  that  are  getting  no  attention  whatso-
ever and no work is going on, and I wondered what the other three
were  and  why  they  are  not  a  priority  but  specifically  with  respect
to the unmanned vehicles, it seems to me there would be some nat-
ural payoffs and that NASA would be the ideal place to study how
we  manage  unmanned  flight  and  how  it  relates  to  an  increasingly
crowded  airspace.  I  know  there  are  a  number  of  federal  agencies
who have a keen interest in using unmanned vehicles, probably the
private sector as well, and I wanted to know why, you know, what
the  reasons  are  that  NASA  has  failed  to  establish  a  research
project and make this a priority?

Dr.  SHIN.  Yes.  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  NASA’s  current  re-
search  portfolio  does  address  UAV-related  technologies.  We  do  not
have  focus  project  bearing  the  UAV  in  the  project  name  or  title  so
one  might  think  that  we  are  not  addressing  UAV-related  tech-
nologies,  but  if  we  examine  all  the  portfolios  that  we  have,  tech-
nology  investment,  a  lot  of  technologies  are  contributing  to  the
UAV  community  that  they  need  in  the  future.  So  again,  from  the
R&D  perspective,  we  are  contributing  to  UAV  requirements  and
needs. In fact, I have asked—this is a vague area because we don’t
have  clear  single  project  addressing  UAV.  I  can  certainly  appre-
ciate  why  external  folks  may  feel  that  we  are  not  addressing  UAV
as  diligently  or  focused  way  as  we  should,  so  I  have  directed  my
program managers to come up with clear communication and cata-
loging all the things that the technology areas that are contributing
to  UAV,  so  that  is  in  work,  and  when  that  documentation  is  com-
pleted,  I  would  like  to  provide  that  to  Congress  for  your  informa-
tion.

[The information follows:]

INFORMATION FOR THE RECORD

NASA expects to have the UAV documentation discussed above completed by the
end  of  August  2008,  and  the  Agency  will  provide  to  the  Subcommittee  the  tech-
nology  areas  that  the  Aeronautics  Research  Mission  Directorate  is  contributing  to
UAVs in that timeframe.

Mr.  FEENEY.  Well,  thank  you,  and  I  can  say  that  in  addition  to
the  technology,  there  is  an  issue  about  rules  and  protocols.  The
FAA for a long time hasn’t really figured out how to manage UAVs,
and  that  has  been  a  hindrance,  I  think,  in  the  private  sector  be-
cause  they  don’t  know  when  or  if  they  are  going  to  be  able  to  get
permission to fly, so to the extent that regulatory hurdles and tech-
nology  hurdles  are  holding  back  some  real  opportunities  where  we
know we have needs.

Mr. Meade, do you want to respond to Dr. Shin’s——
Mr.  MEADE.  Yes,  sir,  I  can.  The  UAV  issues  with  respect  to  the
decadal study, remember that we have to match up the milestones
that  are  specified  in  the  decadal  study  with  what  NASA  is  doing,
and  if  there  is  not  an  exact  match,  well,  then  we  basically  have  to
say  there  is  not  a  match,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  NASA  is
flying  a  couple  of  Global  Hawks  very  recently,  I  do  believe,  and
some other unmanned vehicles, and so they are active in that area
to  help  explain  a  little  bit  of  the  confusion.  They  simply  did  not
match up with the milestone specified in the decadal study, so that
is  where  that  comes  from.  Furthermore,  with  regard  to  the  large
systems  analysis  that  would  be  required  to  integrate  a  UAV  into
the  airspace  and  fly  correctly,  you  know,  NASA  is  very  good  at
doing  those  sorts  of  things  but  they  are  not  the  regulatory  agency
for deciding how to fly them in the airspace.

Mr.  FEENEY.  And  are  you  aware  of  the  current  status  of  the
FAA’s  position  as  to  giving  permission  or  access  to  airspace  for
UAVs?

Mr. MEADE. From the Committee’s standpoint, no. From my own
personal  opinion,  the  last  I  heard,  it  was  get  above  the  controlled
airspace,  which  is  60,000  feet,  and  fly  it  out.  Obviously  that  is  a
very  specialized  mission  and  that  is—basically  I  am  uninformed  of
any other operations.

Mr.  FEENEY.  But  obviously  that  is  having  a  real  deterrent  effect

to development and use and experiments with UAVs.

Mr.  MEADE.  Absolutely.  If  you  don’t  know  what  the  regulations

are going to be, you can’t design your system correctly.

Mr. FEENEY. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  UDALL.  I  want  to  thank  the  Ranking  Member  for  his
participation today, and I think this has been an excellent hearing.
We  have  covered  a  lot  of  ground  with  a  really  focused  set  of  ques-
tions  and  testimony.  I  want  to  thank  all  of  you  for  your  presence
here today. I would editorialize that I think we have confirmed the
importance  of  the  aeronautics  arm  of  NASA  and  I  think  we  have
confirmed  the  importance  of  it  to  our  economy,  particularly  as  we
move  forward.  I  think  we  have  confirmed  that  we  are  in  some
strong competitive environments, Mr. Henne, but that we have the
know-how  and  the  capital  and  the  potential  if  we  have  the  right
kind of support from NASA.

And  this  is  where  I  will  editorialize:  I  don’t  think  we  have
enough  resources.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  Mr.  Feeney  dur-
ing  the  rest  of  this  Congress  and  with  the  next  administration,
whoever leads it, to find additional resources for the very, very im-
portant that is being done with NASA and in partnership with the
private sector.

Mr. FEENEY. I wasn’t going to say that I hope the next adminis-

trator is a former aviator, so I won’t say that.

Chairman  UDALL.  There  would  be  an  element  of  leverage  there,
wouldn’t  there?  But  I  hope  whoever  is  the  next  President  under-
stands the importance of the new economy tied to aeronautics and,
I would add, aerospace.

tional statements from the Members and for answers to any follow-

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Jaiwon  Shin,  Associate  Administrator,  Aeronautics  Research  Mission

Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. In  its  report,  the  National  Research  Council  recommended  that  NASA  establish
a more direct link with the U.S. industry to provide technology transfer in a way
that  does  not  necessarily  include  the  immediate,  public  dissemination  of  results
to  potential  foreign  competitors.  This  is  consistent  with  the  1958  Space  Act  es-
tablishing  NASA  which  called  for  ‘‘the  preservation  of  the  United  States  pre-
eminent  position  in  aeronautics  and  space  through  research  and  technology  de-
velopment  related  to  associated  manufacturing  processes.’’  How  will  NASA  im-
plement NRC’s recommendation?

A1. There  are  several  mechanisms  in  place  to  transfer  knowledge  between  NASA
and  U.S.  Industry.  Specifically,  non-reimbursable  Space  Act  Agreements  (SAA),
NASA  Research  Announcement  awards,  and  Small  Business  Innovative  Research
projects provide an opportunity to transfer knowledge. In addition, NASA personnel
participating  on  technical  committees  (e.g.,  Radio  Technical  Commission  for  Aero-
nautics, Society of Automotive Engineers, American Institute of Aeronautics and As-
tronautics  forums)  inform  those  groups  of  latest  research  findings  as  they  develop
industry-wide  standards,  guidelines,  and  recommended  practices  for  advance  tech-
nology concepts. NASA Aeronautics Research projects also sponsor informal working
groups  with  industry  participation  (many  of  whom  are  SAA  partners)  in  which  an
open forum is provided for industry to learn the latest goings on in the project and
for NASA to learn of emerging challenges facing the community.

NASA believes that publishing the results of its research is important to its mis-
sion. Part of NASA’s charter in the Space Act includes the ‘‘widest practical and ap-
propriate  dissemination  of  information.’’  The  National  Aeronautics  R&D  Policy  also
directs  NASA  to  ‘‘provide  for  the  widest  practical  and  appropriate  dissemination  of
research  results,  consistent  with  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  the  Office  of
Management  and  Budget’s  Information  Quality  Guidelines.’’  In  addition,  many  of
NASA’s  research  areas  (for  example  air  traffic  management  research)  must  be  co-
ordinated  with  other  research  and  regulatory  entities  around  the  globe,  given  the
global nature of air transportation.
Q2. The NRC found that NASA’s four research centers focused on aeronautics, which
account for less than one third of NASA’s total civil service workforce, absorbed
almost 80 percent of NASA’s reduction in civil service employees. Are there plans
to continue this trend or redress this imbalance in the next five years?

A2. Achieving  success  and  sustaining  vibrancy  in  all  of  NASA’s  mission  areas  over
the  next  few  years  is  a  challenge  requiring  NASA  to  draw  on  all  of  its  expertise
and  resources.  Mission  success  will  depend  on  ten  strong,  healthy  Centers,  and  the
Agency  is  committed  to  workforce  management  that  supports  that  goal.  Workforce
planning  has  been  more  effectively  integrated  into  the  annual  budget  process  and
the  assignment  of  work  to  the  NASA  workforce  is  supported  through  a  high  level
of collaboration between the programs and the Centers. Where civil service work de-
mand  exceeds  available  workforce  at  a  Center,  it  is  shifted  to  Centers  where  work-
force is available. With plans to assign important space flight development activities
in  exploration  and  science  to  all  of  the  Centers,  NASA  does  not  expect  significant
declines  at  three  of  the  four  research  Centers.  The  exception  is  the  Dryden  Flight
Research  Center  (DFRC),  for  which  an  estimated  6.2  percent  reduction  is  antici-
pated  in  the  civil  service  workforce  from  FY  2007  levels  to  the  estimated  FY  2013
levels. However, with significant work assignments remaining to be made in support
of  various  exploration  programs,  NASA  is  committed  to  finding  a  viable,  long-term
role for DFRC.
Q3. The  absence  of  runway  incursion  tools  is  one  of  the  most  glaring  omissions  in
today’s air transportation system. What can NASA do to assist Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) in correcting this deficiency and improve the safety of air-
port runways?

A3. NASA  has  been  instrumental  in  developing  technologies  that  can:  sense  where
aircraft  are  on  the  airport;  portray  where  the  aircraft  are  to  the  pilot;  portray  Air
Traffic  Control  (ATC)  clearances  to  the  pilot;  and,  alert  the  pilot  if  he/she  deviates
from  their  assigned  flight  path,  or  if  a  hazardous  runway  incursion  has  occurred.
This  research  complements  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  research,  which

has  largely  focused  on  technologies  to  aid  the  controller  and  on  airport  signage,
lighting, and markings. Runway safety is one of the FAA’s highest priorities, as evi-
denced  in  their  major  investments  in  Airport  Surface  Detection  Equipment-Model
X  and  Runway  Status  Lights,  and  the  Runway  Incursion  Reduction  Program.  The
benefits  of  NASA’s  developments  have  been  published,  and  NASA  personnel  con-
tinue to serve on Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics standards committees
to  communicate  their  findings  to  industry.  The  current  and  planned  future  NASA
research  and  development  related  to  runway  incursions  extends  the  previous  work
by focusing on the implications of NextGen operating concepts.

On an ongoing basis, NASA can assist the FAA in several ways: provide technical
advice support the FAA in advancing and expediting the implementation of enabling
technologies  in  system  concept  as  defined  by  the  past  FAA/NASA  collaborative  ef-
forts; participate in standards development activities; provide human factors subject
matter expertise to review of FAA-developed mitigations; and continue to participate
in runway safety forums organized by FAA.
Q4. How  important  is  NASA’s  human  factors  research  to  NextGen?  What  human
factors  research  is  NASA  planning  to  do  to  validate  NextGen’s  ability  to  shift
decision-making from the ground to the cockpit?

A4. NASA  understands  the  importance  of  human  systems  integration  creating  an
effective  and  efficient  NextGen  air  transportation  system,  and  has  planned  critical
Human System Integration research in its programs. The Airspace Systems and the
Aviation  Safety  Programs  research  the  evolving  role  of  humans  in  a  more  highly
automated national airspace system. Defining the roles and responsibilities between
pilot  and  controller  and  between  human  and  automation  is  an  active  area  of  re-
search  in  both  programs.  In  addition,  understanding  issues  involved  in  assigning
the  locus  of  control,  whether  it  be  on  the  ground  (a  centralized  control  concept)  or
on the flight deck (a distributed control concept), will be critical to full development
of  an  efficient  concept  of  operations  for  NextGen.  Research  to  answer  these  funda-
mental  questions  is  currently  being  pursued  in  early  stages  of  operational  concept
development and by conducting human-in-the-loop evaluation studies employing ac-
tive  controllers  and  pilots.  Human  System  Integration  research  is  important  to  the
advances  in  areas  of  separation  assurance,  dynamic  airspace  configuration,  flight
deck situational awareness, and airspace super-density operation.
Q5. The  Secretary  of  Transportation  tasked  the  JDPO  with  developing  an  action
plan with its partner agencies that would accelerate the introduction of NextGen
capabilities,  possibly  with  a  regional  demonstration.  What,  if  any,  would
NASA’s role be?

A5. NASA will continue to address the fundamental research needs for NextGen by
conducting  applied  research  and  development  for  advanced  vehicles,  safety  and  air
transportation  systems.  Fundamental  research  includes  foundational  physics,  dis-
cipline  and  multi-discipline  studies  and  system-level  integration.  The  Fundamental
Aeronautics, Aviation Safety and Airspace Systems Programs conduct this research.
Under  the  NextGen  Acceleration  Action  Plan,  the  Federal  Aviation  Administra-
tion  (FAA)  will  implement  several  algorithms  that  were  completed  by  NASA  under
the  Airspace  Systems  Program.  These  algorithms  include  aircraft  sequencing  and
scheduling  under  airport  constraints  and  surface  management.  Because  the  re-
search is complete and the algorithms have already transitioned to the FAA, NASA
will have at most a limited consulting role for implementation.

NASA’s  direct  contribution  to  the  Action  Plan  is  to  accelerate  validation  studies
that  are  coordinated  with  the  FAA  and  the  Joint  Planning  and  Development  Office
(JPDO)  via  Research  Transition  Teams.  In  particular,  NASA  will  accelerate  valida-
tion  and  demonstration  of  methods  related  to  traffic  management  advisor  and  sur-
face  management.  The  NASA  and  FAA  Research  Transition  Team  co-leads  have
been  identified  for  both  surface  and  traffic  management,  and  planning  workshops
are  underway  to  establish  joint  roadmaps.  In  addition,  NASA  will  collaborate  with
the FAA to insure that research studies focus on regions, such as south Florida, that
are  targeted  for  FAA  demonstration  and  implementation.  NASA’s  contribution,
which  is  consistent  with  our  long-term  research  role,  will  enable  the  FAA  to  in-
crease  the  impact  on  air  transportation  system  capacity  of  the  initial  deployments
as expanded capabilities are proven.

Lastly,  the  FAA  has  expressed  an  interest  in  accelerating  the  implementation  of
technologies  for  closely  spaced  parallel  runways.  NASA  is  reviewing  its  portfolio  in
super density operations to determine if planned studies address the FAA’s concept
exploration requirements for closely spaced parallel runways.

Q6. In  identifying  research  challenges  in  NextGen,  you  cite  in  your  statement  the
need  for  ‘‘improved  software  verification  and  validation  techniques  to  prevent
anomalies  that  could  propagate  across  highly  integrated  systems  with  unin-
tended  consequences.’’  With  the  difficulty  both  the  Federal  Government  and  the
private  sector  experience  in  competing  for  software  engineering  talent,  what
strategies will NASA use to address this issue in a comprehensive way?

A6. NASA’s Aviation Safety Program has two approaches for addressing this issue.
First,  the  Integrated  Resilient  Aircraft  Control  project  is  developing  methods  of
verifying  and  validating  complex  flight  software.  Second,  the  Integrated  Vehicle
Health  Management  project  is  examining  methods  of  software  health  management
(i.e.,  on-board  monitors  that  can  identify  anomalies  in  software-driven  behavior  be-
fore they propagate). NASA’s in-house level of effort is relatively small but is being
given  additional  resources  to  grow.  NASA  also  is  discussing  collaborative  research
with  the  National  Science  Foundation,  and  has  issued  several  NASA  Research  An-
nouncements and Small Business Innovation Research to involve industry and aca-
demia and extend the scale of our research.
Q7. What  will  be  the  state  of  NASA’s  research  in  an  on-board  system  to  detect  haz-
ardous icing conditions when it is completed? Would this include validation and
operational  demonstrations?  What  do  you  plan  to  hand  over  to  the  private  sec-
tor?

A7. A  wide  range  of  icing  research  is  central  to  NASA’s  Aviation  Safety  Program.
Within  this  program,  the  Intelligent  Integrated  Flight  Deck  project  is  developing  a
range of look-ahead technologies to portray potential icing conditions to pilots before
they  enter  them.  The  technologies,  utilizing  radiometry  and  radar,  determine  the
threat severity and will communicate to the flight deck through the on-board Exter-
nal  Hazards  Monitor.  The  Integrated  Vehicle  Health  Management  project  is  devel-
oping  sensors  to  identify  ice  accretion  on  the  airframe  and  in  the  engine,  allowing
pilots  to  take  corrective  action  before  the  accretion  becomes  severe.  The  Intelligent
Research  Aircraft  Control  project  is  examining  the  underlying  physics  of  ice  accre-
tion in jet engines with the goal of developing propulsion systems that are not sus-
ceptible  to  icing.  This  work  includes  validation  in  the  Icing  Research  Tunnel  and
other  ground-based  facilities,  and  flight  validation  on  NASA’s  specially  instru-
mented  Twin  Otter  and  S–3  Viking.  NASA  is  widely  recognized  as  a  world  leader
in  the  field  of  aircraft  icing.  NASA  collaborates  extensively  with  the  Federal  Avia-
tion  Administration  and  with  the  private  sector  (including  through  reimbursable
work  sponsored  by  industry,  and  through  Space  Act  Agreements,  NASA  Research
Announcements  and  Small  Business  Innovation  Research;  hence  transfer  of  the
technology  is  natural.  NASA  personnel  also  actively  contribute  to  a  range  of  indus-
try  working  groups  and  standards  committees  to  examine  further  needs  for  NASA
research  to  enable  successful  transition  of  these  technologies  to  the  private  sector.
NASA technical publications will also be used.
Q8. What  is  the  current  understanding  of  the  effects  of  space  radiation  and  solar  x-
ray events on aircrew and on aircraft systems including avionics, high frequency
communication,  and  GPS  navigation  systems,  especially  during  high  latitude
polar  routes?  What  specific  issues  are  not  well  understood  and  what,  if  any,  re-
search  is  being  conducted  by  NASA  to  address  those  gaps?  What,  if  any,  inter-
action does NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate have with NASA’s
Science  Mission  Directorate,  the  JPDO,  and  agencies  such  as  National  Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the status of research, models, and
data from satellite sensors that may help improve the prediction and severity of
space weather events and their potential application to civil aviation?

A8. NASA’s  Aviation  Safety  Program  has  examined,  and  continues  to  examine,  the
impact of high intensity radio frequencies and other strong sources of radiation, in-
cluding lightning. NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) is not
conducting  research  on  the  effects  of  space  radiation  and  solar  x-ray  events  on  ei-
ther  air  crew  or  aircraft  systems;  however,  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  ac-
tively  conducts  research  on  space  radiation  and  solar  x-ray  input  into  Earth’s
geospace  environment  and  co-chairs  the  interagency  National  Space  Weather  Pro-
gram.  The  Science  Mission  Directorate  is  the  lead  NASA  representative  on  the
JPDO  Weather  Working  Group  whose  goal  is  to  reduce  the  adverse  impacts  of
weather on air traffic operations. Space weather events and their potential applica-
tion to civil aviation fall within the scope of the Weather Working Group, and long-
range  plans  envision  space  weather  data  to  be  incorporated  within  the  net-centric
four-dimensional  weather  information  system.  ARMD  participates  on  the  Weather
Working  Group.  Further,  ARMD  also  represents  NASA  on  the  NextGen  Executive

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Carl J. Meade, Co-Chair, Committee for the Assessment of NASA’s Aer-

onautics Research Program, National Research Council

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Mr. Henne recommended in his testimony that NASA’s Aeronautics procurement
policies  be  enhanced  to  allow  commercial  contracting  practices.  During  your  re-
view  of  NASA’s  aeronautics  program,  were  contracting  difficulties  identified  by
the Principal Investigators the Committee met with? In your opinion, would the
use  of  commercial  contracting  policies,  as  advocated  by  Mr.  Henne,  alleviate
these difficulties?

A1. No Principal Investigator (PI) mentioned difficulties with contracting as an im-
pediment  to  their  research.  I  suspect,  however,  that  such  comments  would  have
been thought to be outside the scope of the Committee’s interests and therefore con-
sidered  irrelevant  by  the  PIs.  It  is  commonly  recognized  that  the  government  pro-
curement practices are structured to be (and be perceived as being) fair and impar-
tial—at  the  price  of  efficiency.  Although  the  government  has  made  some  strides  to
reduce the bureaucracy associated with ‘‘small’’ procurements, my experience shows
that there remains a significant difference in the efficiency between and commercial
procurement  practices.  Although  it  is  vitally  important  that  the  system  be  struc-
tured  to  eliminate  any  potential  for  abuse,  there  is  a  point  of  diminishing  returns
where  the  effort  expended  to  make  a  perfect  system  is  much  more  costly  than  one
that is agile, flexible and adaptable to the immediate situation.
Q2. With  regards  to  NASA’s  research  facilities,  your  committee  found  that  these  fa-
cilities, with a few exceptions, meet the relevant needs of existing aeronautics re-
search. However, your committee also noted that at the current investment rate,
widespread  facility  degradation  will  impact  the  ability  of  ARMD  projects  and
other  important  national  aeronautics  research  and  development  to  achieve  their
goals.  Consequently,  your  committee  recommended,  absent  an  infusion  of  addi-
tional funds, that NASA continue to assess facilities and mothball or decommis-
sion  facilities  of  lesser  importance  so  that  the  most  important  facilities  can  be
properly sustained. How serious do you view the future state of NASA’s research
facilities? How should your recommendation on possibly moth-balling or decom-
missioning  facilities  be  considered  by  the  RDT&E  infrastructure  plan  currently
being developed in response to the 2005 NASA Authorization Act?

A2. The  Committee  considers  the  current  status  of  NASA  aeronautics  research  fa-
cilities,  as  ‘minimal.’  We  endorse  NASA’s  efforts  to  ensure  that  retention/mainte-
nance  of  facilities  carefully  aligned  with  the  research  objectives.  Furthermore,  the
requirement  to  maintain  NASA  research  infrastructure  should  be  evaluated  while
considering  both  DOD  and  NASA  facilities  to  eliminate  overlap  and  duplication,  if
any.  To  this  end,  the  NASA  Administrator  and  the  have  established  the  National
Partnership for Aeronautical Test (NPAT) alliance. As a result, two studies of NASA
and DOD facilities has been chartered. The first study was of Transonic Wind Tun-
nels and was completed in October 2007 (documented in AEDC–TR–07–12.) The sec-
ond  study  is  underway  and  is  investigating  Supersonic  Wind  Tunnels.  Additional
studies  are  planned  for  Subsonic  Wind  Tunnels  and  Hypersonic  Wind  Tunnels.
These studies will gather detailed information on the government facilities of inter-
est  to  compare  capabilities/conditions  of  the  facilities.  These  studies,  in  addition  to
the NSTC’s ‘‘National Plan for Aeronautics Research and Development and Related
Infrastructure,’’ could be used to determine the national RDT&E infrastructure that
satisfies national aeronautics R&D goals and objectives. This will drive assessments
of which facilities should be maintained, upgraded, moth-balled or decommissioned.
Nevertheless,  even  with  the  optimum  investment  of  funds  currently  budgeted  for
NASA’s aeronautics facilities, as time passes it is more and more likely that facility
shortcomings  will  become  a  serious  impediment  to  aeronautics  research  by  NASA
and the Nation and/or increase the extent to which U.S. aeronautics R&D programs
must rely on foreign facilities.
Q3. In  correlating  the  51  highest-priority  R&T  challenges  in  the  Decadal  Survey  of
Civil  Aeronautics  to  NASA’s  research  portfolio,  your  committee  found  that  over
a third reflected inconsistencies between NASA projects and the Decadal Survey.
Can you give us an example of an area of inconsistency, particularly one result-
ing from NASA choosing to do little or no work? Was the reason related to inad-
equate funding or something else?

65

A3. The  Committee  found  that  inconsistencies  are  generally  the  result  of  NASA
choosing  to  do  little  or  no  work  in  a  particular  task  area  and/or  selecting  research
goals  that  fall  short  of  advancing  the  state  of  the  art  far  enough  and  with  enough
urgency  either  to  make  a  substantial  difference  in  meeting  individual  R&T  chal-
lenges or the larger goal of achieving the strategic objectives of the Decadal Survey
of Civil Aeronautics. Examples of inconsistencies can be seen by examining Decadal
Survey  challenges  such  as  D10  (Safe  Operation  of  Unmanned  Air  Vehicles  in  the
National Airspace,) and B3 (Intelligent Engines and Mechanical Power Systems Ca-
pable of Self-Diagnosis and Reconfiguration Between Shop Visits.) Considering D10;
neither the NGATS ATM–Airportal Project, NGATS ATM–Airspace Project, nor the
IRAC Project have planned research to address the Decadal Survey milestones. Con-
sidering B3; although the Subsonic Fixed Wing and Supersonic Projects are partici-
pating  in  this  research  area,  their  results  are  unlikely  to  make  a  significant  dif-
ference  to  the  state-of-the-art;  most  of  the  research  relevant  to  this  challenge  for
these flight regimes is being funded by organizations other than NASA.

However,  as  noted  in  the  Committee’s  report,  NASA  does  not  have  the  resources
necessary to address all 51 R&T challenges simultaneously in a thorough and com-
prehensive manner, and so it is inevitable that the project plans, as a whole, do not
fully  address  all  the  priorities  of  the  Decadal  Survey.  Determining  how  or  why
ARMD  decided  which  priorities  to  pursue—and  which  to  defer—was  beyond  the
scope  of  our  study,  and  the  Committee  was  not  given  adequate  information  to  this
issue.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. During  your  appearance  before  our  subcommittee,  you  testified  that  aside  from
the  quality  of  the  research  conducted  by  ARMD,  we  would  stress  the  need  for
a  cultural  change  within  the  directorate.  Indeed,  the  Committee  was  most  con-
cerned  about  the  lack  of  urgency  demonstrated  by  some  projects  and  the  tend-
ency  of  some  researchers  to  assume  that  the  ultimate  consumer  of  the  fruits  of
their  labor  was  NASA  itself.  You  then  went  on  to  cite  one  of  ARMD’s  guiding
principles  as  an  example  of,  perhaps,  poor  guidance  that  might  drive  this
mindset.  Could  you  elaborate  further  on  the  need  for  cultural  change?  Beyond
the  lack  of  urgency  mentioned  in  your  statement,  what  other  attributes  did  the
Committee find deserving of attention?

A1. The  Committee  came  to  recognize  that  some  (but  certainly,  not  all)  PIs  exhib-
ited  an  inwardly  focused  attitude.  We  noted  also  the  three  guiding  principles  pub-
lished by ARMD:

1. We will dedicate ourselves to the mastery and intellectual stewardship of the

core competencies of aeronautics for the Nation in all flight regimes.

2. We  will  focus  our  research  in  areas  that  are  appropriate  to  NASA’s  unique

capabilities.

3. We will directly address the fundamental research needs of the Next Genera-
tion  Air  Transportation  System  (NextGen)  in  partnership  with  the  member
agencies of the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO).

Considering  the  above  principles—particularly  the  first  two—it  may  not  be  sur-
prising  that  several  contact  with  other  stakeholders  and  have  evidently  failed  to
benchmark  their  objectives  and  progress  against  external  research(ers).  Con-
sequently, the Committee recommends that NASA focus on ensuring better ties be-
tween its research and the intended users of its research. Specifically, ARMD should
ensure  that  its  research  program  substantively  advances  the  state  of  the  art  and
makes  a  significant  difference  in  a  time  frame  of  interest  to  users  of  the  research
results  by  (1)  making  a  concerted  effort  to  identify  the  potential  users  of  ongoing
research  and  how  that  research  relates  to  their  needs  and  (2)  prioritizing  potential
research opportunities according to an accepted set of metrics. Furthermore, ARMD
should  bridge  the  gap  between  research  and  application—and  thereby  increase  the
likelihood that this research will be of value to the intended users—as follows:

• Foster  closer  connections  between  NASA  principal  investigators  and  the  po-
tential  external  and  internal  users  of  their  research,  which  include  U.S.  in-
dustry, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, aca-
demia, and the NASA space exploration program.
• Improve  research  planning  to  ensure  that  the  results  are  likely  to  be  avail-
able  in  time  to  meet  the  future  needs  of  the  Nation.  Consistently  articulate
during  the  course  of  project  planning  and  execution  how  research  results  are
tied  to  capability  improvements  and  how  results  will  be  transferred  to  users.

66

Implementing  the  above  actions  will  require  the  flexibility  to  assign  personnel
possessing  the  right  scientific  talent  to  the  right  job  at  the  right  time.  The  current
personnel practices of the NASA Centers inhibit flexibility. The inability to reassign
personnel with ease as the situation dictates will inevitably result in organizational
behavior that matches its goals to the personnel on hand, rather than the preferable
alternative:  choosing  the  most  worthwhile  goals  and  then  staffing  with  the  correct
personnel to achieve those goals.
Q2. Assuming that ARMD’s budget profile does not change substantially in the near-
term, given a choice between continuing its current approach of foundational re-
search  across  a  broad  swath  of  research  topics  versus  funding  periodic  large-
scale  demonstration  flights  at  the  expense  of  limiting  research  to  a  smaller  set
of projects and activities, which option would you find more attractive, and why?
A2. In  the  short-term,  a  narrowly  scoped  ARMD  research  program  that  includes
flight  demonstration  projects  will  be  most  valuable.  However,  reducing  the  scope  of
NASA’s  research  will  cause  long-term  harm  by  eliminating  the  basic  research  that
would provide the foundation for applied research in the future. The ‘‘best’’ approach
is  a  matter  of  philosophy  and  expectation.  If  one  expects  the  ARMD  budget  to  one
day  be  restored  to  historic  levels  (allowing  NASA  to  conduct  meaningful  research
on  a  wide  variety  of  aeronautical  disciplines  and  applications)  then  it  makes  sense
for  NASA  to  continue  a  broadly-scoped  program  of  foundational  research.  This
would  conserve  core  competencies  until  that  brighter  day  arrives,  even  though  it
means that NASA would be unlikely to make significant contributions to solving the
critical aeronautics issues of today. On the other hand, if one believes that the cur-
rent retrenchment in the NASA aeronautics budget is likely to continue indefinitely,
then  NASA  would  be  better  served  by  making  the  hard  choices  to  reduce  the  scope
of  its  research  and  focus  its  resources  on  areas  where  it  can  make  significant  con-
tributions.  Regardless  of  the  approach  taken,  the  Committee  emphasizes  that  all
aeronautics research must eventually be validated in flight. Government flight dem-
onstration  are  important  because  in  many  cases  flight  demonstrations  are  beyond
the economic viability of the commercial sector. This is particularly true with break-
through  technologies  that  have  the  highest  potential  payoff—and  the  highest  risk
of failure. Re-establishing major flight demonstration projects under NASA sponsor-
ship  has  the  added  benefit  of  encouraging  and  inspiring  our  young  people  to  con-
sider a career in aerospace engineering.
Q3. During the hearing, it was suggested that ARMD research findings initially not
be broadly disseminated in order to provide domestic companies an opportunity
to capitalize on new discoveries. Do you agree with this concept?
a. If  such  a  policy  were  implemented,  what  effects  would  it  have  on  domestic
companies’ ability to do business with foreign partners and customers? Would
it imperil business relationships and collaborations?

b. How  does  NASA’s  current  policy  compare  with  that  of  other  foreign  govern-
ments  who  underwrite  aeronautics  research  and  development?  Do  they  pub-
licly disseminate new discoveries?

A3. It  is  essential  to  understand  the  very  limited  nature  of  the  recommendation
that  the  Committee  is  making  with  regard  to  foreign  dissemination  of  research  re-
sults.  In  particular,  I  agree  with  the  Senior  Vice  President  Henne’s  statement  dur-
ing the hearing, that if NASA policy regarding the dissemination of research results
‘‘becomes crippling, it doesn’t do anyone any good.’’ However, the U.S. aerospace in-
dustry competes on an international scale. In the Internet world of today, when re-
search  results  are  made  public,  they  are  available  instantaneously  to  domestic  and
foreign  competitors  alike.  Foreign  competitors  are  often  more  agile  (due  to  various
reasons  such  as  less  burdensome  regulatory  environment,  etc.)  and  can  react  more
quickly  to  incorporate  research  results  into  marketable  products.  The  Committee
recommends  that  NASA  establish  a  process  that  would  allow  the  American  tax-
payer,  as  underwriters  of  NASA  research,  to  have  an  opportunity  to  benefit  from
the  research  products  before  making  them  available  for  off-shore  production.  rec-
ommendation  would  provide  additional  inducements  for  industry  and  academia  to
partner  with  NASA,  without  creating  any  new  requirements  that  would  discourage
such  partnering.  In  particular,  the  Committee  recommends  that  NASA  establish  a
mechanism U.S. commercial sector researchers could use, at their sole discretion, to
limit  the  dissemination  of  research  they  conduct  with  NASA.  Such  a  mechanism
would  not  inhibit  academic  researchers,  who  generally  want  to  publish  the  results
of  their  research  and  who  are  staffed  with  many  foreign  nationals.  Neither  would
it  inhibit  industry  researchers  from  publicly  disseminating  the  results  of  their  re-
search when they believe it is beneficial to do so. But if a U.S. company and NASA

67

would benefit from cooperative research with NASA, having the option to limit dis-
semination  of  its  research  results  to  foreign  competitors  for  a  period  of  time  might
make  that  company  more  inclined  to  partner  with  NASA  in  that  research,  to  the
benefit  of  NASA,  the  U.S.  aeronautics  industry  and  the  public  in  general.  Framed
in this way, such a policy would not inhibit a domestic company’s ability to do busi-
ness with foreign partners and competitors since the limitation on public/foreign dis-
semination  could  be  waived  at  the  discretion  of  the  U.S.  company  conducting  the
research.

The  Committee  did  not  investigate  the  policies  of  any  foreign  governments.  Al-
though  I  do  not  know  the  details,  it  is  my  belief  that  most  foreign  governments  re-
strict the world-wide dissemination of their aeronautics research.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Preston  A.  Henne,  Senior  Vice  President,  Programs,  Engineering  and

Testing, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. In  your  statement,  you  indicate  that  financially  successful  and  environmentally
acceptable  civil  supersonic  transportation  is  still  to  be  achieved.  What  are  the
challenges  associated  with  civil  supersonic  transportation  and  what  role  should
NASA’s R&D play in addressing them?

A1. The challenges are many, but environmentally acceptable implementation is es-
sential to financial success. This requires mitigation of the sonic boom which we all
know significantly hampered Concorde operations, as well as adaptability to new en-
gine  technologies  which  reduce  harmful  emissions.  A  research  aircraft  must  be  de-
veloped and flown over land to demonstrate the sonic boom mitigation technologies,
and  through  that,  provide  the  technical  database  for  justifying  a  change  in  current
supersonic flight regulations.

NASA, in partnership with industry, has the enterprise to engage such a plan for
our country, and prove out the resultant capability through a large-scale, ‘‘relevant,’’
low-boom  flight  research  program.  This  program  would  provide  both  a  focal  point
and  transition  opportunity  for  various  NASA  R&D  pipelines  and  conclude  with  an
exploration of community response to low-boom, supersonic flight over land.
Q2. I understand that Gulfstream Aerospace and NASA have had a successful part-
nership  in  testing  the  Quiet  SpikeΤΜ concept  in  flight,  an  extendable  telescopic
boom that helps suppress sonic booms. How well did that research collaboration
work?  Are  there  any  ‘‘lessons  learned’’  that  you  think  should  be  applied  to
NASA’s interactions with industry in the future?

A2. It worked very well. The Gulfstream team provided the idea and the hardware,
and  NASA  provided  the  flight  test  platform  and  flight  test  expertise.  Gulfstream
and NASA concluded the Quiet SpikeΤΜ flight test program with an extremely suc-
cessful industry-government partnership. It was not without its share of challenges.
In the end, the success came from a small, experienced, and highly-motivated team
being  fully  integrated  into  NASA’s  research  environment  with  frequent  open  com-
munication and an aggressive technical goal.
Q3. At present, commercial supersonic flight over the U.S. is prohibited due to sonic
boom  concerns.  What  needs  to  happen  for  that  prohibition  to  be  removed,  and
what role should NASA play? Are there other research areas related to commer-
cial supersonic flight that NASA should be involved in?

A3. The prohibition needs to be converted to a rational rule that manufacturers can
use  for  design  and  to  show  compliance  with.  This  regulatory  change  needs  to  occur
in  the  ICAO/CAEP  international  environment  for  setting  accepted  international
standards. This process, while started, is in need of real flight data indicating feasi-
bility. As stated above, flight demonstration of a low-boom aircraft that achieves an
‘‘acceptable’’ acoustic signature at the ground would greatly facilitate removal of the
supersonic  prohibition  and  establishment  of  a  new  standard.  The  flight  vehicle
proves  the  physics  and  validates  that  shaping  technologies  eliminate  the  environ-
mental and social acceptability concerns associated with the sonic boom.

Ideally,  NASA  would  fully  fund  such  a  program.  However,  a  more  financially
practical  approach  for  NASA  would  be  to  engage  in  a  supportive  and  collaborative
effort with industry in the development and test of the experimental low-boom vehi-
cle.  NASA  can  also  be  involved  at  a  more  detailed  level  sharing  its  expertise  and
resources  with  industry  partners  in  research  areas  such  as  propulsion,  aircraft
structure,  flight  controls,  aerodynamic  modeling  to  name  only  a  few.  In  parallel,
NASA  should  also  be  tasked  with  preparing  for  flight  research  by  developing  and
demonstrating a capability for monitoring community response using telemetry and
instrumentation  to  correlate  what’s  being  heard  with  Internet-based  social  surveys
that enable broad data collection and analysis.
Q4. In your statement, you recommend that NASA Aeronautics procurement policies
be  enhanced  to  allow  commercial  contracting  practices.  Can  you  provide  some
more details on what you see as the problem and why the use of commercial con-
tracting practices might be an answer at NASA?

A4. Traditional  NASA  contracting  imposes  restrictive  government  cost  accounting
standards under FAR Part 15. This requirement is non-typical for commercial enti-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 11:39 Oct 11, 2008 Jkt 041902 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA08\050108\41902 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

ties  such  as  Gulfstream  and  discourages  partnerships.  In  addition,  restrictive  data
rights  clauses  further  deter  participation  in  research  efforts  for  fear  of  losing  com-
petitive advantage and key intellectual property necessary for market transition.

In  contrast  to  restrictive  cost  accounting,  FAR  Part  12  includes  existing  commer-
cial  terms  which  can  provide  NASA  with  adequate  contractual  protection  under  re-
search contracts. Also, less restrictive data rights provisions would likely encourage
otherwise reluctant commercial firms to support NASA technology development pro-
grams.  The  allowance  or  provision  for  these  established  commercial  policies  could
substantially  increase  the  pool  of  capable  R&D  resources  NASA  has  available  to
support its programs.

Questions submitted by Representative Tom Feeney
Q1. Assuming  that  ARMD’s  budget  profile  doesn’t  not  change  substantially  in  the
near-term,  given  a  choice  between  continuing 
its  current  approach  of
foundational  research  across  a  broad  swath  of  research  topics  versus  funding
periodic  large-scale  demonstration  flights  at  the  expense  of  limiting  research  to
a smaller set of projects and activities, which option would you find more attrac-
tive, and why?

A1. The  latter  option  is  more  attractive  and  is  a  critical  mechanism  for  NASA  to
fully  realize  its  Aeronautics  mission.  Periodic  large-scale  demonstration  by  NASA
Aeronautics has a proven record for lowering technology risk to a level where indus-
try  is  able  to  assist  with  the  completion  of  the  maturation  process.  When  properly
planned for and executed, large-scale demonstrations result in flying laboratories of
exceptional  value,  national  facilities  that  can  provide  tremendous  research  capa-
bility extending far beyond the initial test mission and period of performance.
Q2. During the hearing, it was suggested that ARMD research findings initially not
be broadly disseminated in order to provide domestic companies an opportunity
to capitalize on new discoveries. Do you agree with this concept?
a. If  such  a  policy  were  implemented,  what  effects  would  it  have  on  domestic
companies’ ability to do business with foreign partners and customers? Would
it imperil business relationships and collaborations?

b. How  does  NASA’s  current  policy  compare  with  that  of  other  foreign  govern-
ments  who  underwrite  aeronautics  research  and  development?  Do  they  pub-
licly disseminate new discoveries?

A2. We  agree  in  concept,  that  U.S.  Government  funded  research  should  benefit  do-
mestic  companies.  This  is  consistent  with  NASA’s  original  charter.  Various  NASA
programs  in  the  past  have  had  levels  of  restricted  dissemination  depending  on  the
program.

If  such  a  dissemination  policy  were  implemented,  we  do  not  believe  there  would
have to be a negative impact on the aeronautics industry’s ability to work with for-
eign  entities—partners,  suppliers  and/or  customers.  Meaningful  collaboration  could
still  occur,  however,  U.S.  industry  would  clearly  be  in  a  stronger  position,  given
knowledge  of  government  supported  technology  research  activities.  The  policy  will
likely need to include an approval process to disclose based upon commercial poten-
tial for the U.S.-based entity.

Foreign  governments  often  restrict  the  publication  of  new  discoveries  developed
with  government  funding.  While  the  practice  varies  considerably,  foreign  govern-
ments  appreciate  the  value  of  the  aeronautical  enterprise  and  their  investment  in
it. They do introduce protective measures to benefit their national interests.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Ilan  Kroo,  Professor,  Department  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics,

Stanford University

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. You  note  in  your  prepared  statement  that  the  anticipated  growth  in  air  travel
is  a  tremendous  challenge,  made  even  more  difficult  and  complex  by  the  inser-
tion of potentially larger numbers of unmanned aircraft and even supersonic air-
craft.  How  does  the  inclusion  of  unmanned  and  supersonic  aircraft  in  the  na-
tional  airspace  impact  on  safety?  What  research  is  needed  to  properly  account
for the future assimilation of disparate aircraft flying at different regimes in the
national airspace? Is NASA doing or planning to do that?

A1. At the moment, unmanned and supersonic aircraft are not significant issues af-
fecting  the  capacity  or  safety  of  the  airspace  system.  But  we  anticipate  that  with
additional applications for more-autonomous aircraft in the future and with the pos-
sibility  of  small  civil  supersonic  aircraft,  the  wide  speed  and  altitude  range  of  this
diverse set of air vehicles could become problematic—especially with our current ap-
proach to air traffic management. Rather than stifling innovation in this country by
banning  new  types  of  flight  vehicles,  research  is  needed  on  how  such  aircraft  may
be  accommodated  in  a  next  generation  air  traffic  system.  NASA  is  doing  some  re-
search  in  this  area  as  part  of  the  aeronautics  program  and  through  the  JPDO,  but
more  extensive  cooperative  work  with  DOD  and  FAA  needs  to  be  undertaken,  par-
ticularly  for  improved  autonomous  sense-and-avoid  capabilities  and  more  flexible,
adaptive approaches to air traffic scheduling and control.
Q2. I  note  that  you  have  spent  some  time  in  NASA  as  a  researcher.  Granted  this
was  20  years  ago,  but  can  you  provide  your  views  on  how  the  in-house  re-
searcher  role  has  changed  over  the  years?  In  particular,  do  you  agree  with  the
concern  expressed  in  the  recent  NRC  report  assessing  NASA’s  aeronautics  pro-
gram regarding research time being taken away from in-house NASA personnel
to monitor the performance of outside entities?

A2. Despite  NASA’s  declining  budget  for  aeronautics  over  the  past  decade,  the
Agency still manages to contribute in an important way to research advances in aer-
onautics.  The  role  of  NASA  researchers  has  indeed  changed  greatly  over  the  past
twenty years, mostly due to three factors:

a. Changes  in  the  way  in  which  facilities  are  charged  and  closing  of  many
smaller  experimental  facilities  makes  it  much  more  difficult  for  researchers
to use these facilities themselves. When I was a researcher at NASA’s Ames
Research  Center,  we  tested  several  new,  in-house  designs  in  the  wind  tun-
nels at Ames. This happens very infrequently now as the larger projects and
industry pay for the facilities and NASA researchers support those tests.

b. There  has  been  a  rather  inconsistent  relationship  with  industry  and  aca-
demia over the past twenty years. In the 1990’s many of NASA’s aeronautics
projects  were  associated  with  a  smaller  number  of  large  industry  programs,
while  an  emphasis  on  more  fundamental  work  over  the  past  two  to  three
years  has  allowed  universities  and  small  companies  to  play  a  greater  role.
As  a  result,  NASA  researchers’  involvement  in  externally  funded  research
has changed and it will surely take some time to adapt to these changes.

c. The  decrease  in  the  number  of  experienced,  aeronautics-oriented,  civil  serv-
ants at NASA does mean that a larger fraction of these peoples’ time is spent
monitoring  the  external  research  funded  by  NASA.  Although  the  total
amount of external research funding has not changed dramatically in ARMD,
the  larger  number  of  smaller  contracts  and  the  shrinking  internal  research
budget  and  staff  does  place  increased  demands  on  researchers’  time,  espe-
cially in some of the project areas.

Q3. In  characterizing  the  need  to  address  the  environmental  problems  facing  avia-
tion, you state that while NASA’s fundamental research work addresses some of
the  issues,  the  work  needs  to  be  expanded  and  focused  on  the  most  promising
technologies  if  it  is  to  contribute  in  a  significant  way  to  solving  these  problems.
Could  you  please  elaborate  a  bit  on  that  statement—what  technologies  do  you
think are worth focusing on, and how should NASA proceed? Because of the un-
certainty  associated  with  how  aviation  emissions  will  be  dealt  with  worldwide,
how  would  you  respond  to  the  concern  that  we  may  be  honing  in  on  solutions
without a clear idea of the problem?

A3. NASA  has  recently  adopted  some  challenging  environmental  goals  for  future
aircraft, and these may help to provide a focus for fundamental research in various
fields  of  aeronautics.  However,  a  large  array  of  technologies  may  be  said  to  con-
tribute in some way to these goals and a clear approach to prioritization is needed.
The  NRC  Decadal  Survey  of  Civil  Aeronautics  identified  a  large  number  of  tech-
nologies  that  will  likely  be  important  in  the  development  of  future  aircraft  with
more stringent environmental constraints, but it did not make specific recommenda-
tions  regarding  prioritization  in  light  of  the  budgetary  constraints  under  which
NASA  is  operating.  NASA  seems  to  be  doing  a  good  job  of  identifying  some  of  the
most promising research over the last couple of years, but the problem is great and
the scope of NASA’s aeronautics research is very limited.

Although many aspects of aircraft emissions’ impact on the global environment re-
main  uncertain,  and  the  international  community’s  approach  to  regulation  or  eco-
nomic  incentives  is  not  completely  formulated,  many  of  the  technologies  important
for  future  aircraft  are  not  so  uncertain.  The  benefits  of  improved  fuel  efficiency  in-
clude,  not  just  lower  CO2 emissions,  but  reduced  fuel  cost,  greater  independence
from  foreign  suppliers,  and  improved  performance  for  both  civil  and  military  air-
craft.  It  is  important  to  better  understand  the  relationship  between  aircraft  emis-
sions  at  altitude  and  atmospheric  changes,  but  there  is  little  chance  that  research
enabling  reduced  noise  and  greater  efficiency  will  be  honing  in  on  the  wrong  solu-
tion.
Q4. In  your  opinion,  is  NASA’s  research  on  environmental  issues  too  focused  on
NextGen  or  is  it  broad  enough  to  address  the  issues  that  are  percolating  glob-
ally?

A4. NextGen  as  broadly  defined,  covers  almost  any  aspect  of  a  next  generation  air
transportation system. However, as NASA’s work on NextGen proceeds, areas of em-
phasis  must  be  identified  and  it  appears  that  air  traffic  control/capacity  expansion
will likely form the heart of NASA work on NextGen. This is certainly an important
research  area  because  near-term  changes  to  ATC  are  needed  to  maintain  safety,
while  permitting  future  capacity  increases.  But  it  is  important  not  to  assume  that
the  development  of  new  and  efficient  ATC  system  will  solve  the  problems  of  a  next
generation  aviation  system.  Appending  environmental  and  efficiency  concerns  to  a
program  that  starts  with  traffic  management  may  dilute  the  program  to  the  point
that  no  concern  is  properly  addressed.  I  believe  that  NASA’s  research  and  tech-
nology  development  work  should  address  specific  environmental  objectives  along
with  the  goal  of  increasing  system  capacity.  It  is  not  clear  that  this  should  be  con-
fined to NextGen or the JPDO.
Q5. Some  of  your  research  suggests  that  reduced  aircraft  emissions  and  noise  can
be achieved along with greater fuel efficiency by developing new types of aircraft
that  would  operate  at  slower  cruising  speeds.  Based  on  the  apparent  benefits  of
such new aircraft, have any manufacturers voiced interest in bringing such air-
craft to the marketplace? What reaction would you expect from the flying public?
A5. Aircraft manufacturers are actively considering a range of possible options, par-
ticularly  for  the  next  generation  of  small,  medium  range  aircraft  that  may  replace
the  A320  and  737.  To  an  aircraft  designer  the  difference  between  Mach  0.8  and
Mach  0.75  is  enormous.  To  a  passenger  on  a  flight  from  San  Francisco  to  Wash-
ington, D.C. the difference is about 15 minutes.

Most  current  aircraft  were  designed  when  fuel  cost  $0.25  to  $0.75  per  gallon  and
contributed  less  than  15  percent  to  the  overall  cost  of  a  flight.  With  fuel  costs  now
approaching 50 percent of total costs for some carriers, the airlines are already slow-
ing down the existing fleet to save fuel. Re-designing aircraft with a greater empha-
sis on fuel efficiency, may not just help the environment, but might very well reduce
the cost of flying in the future.

Q1. Assuming that ARMD’s budget profile does not change substantially in the near-
term, given a choice between continuing its current approach of fundamental re-
search  across  a  broad  swath  of  research  topics  versus  funding  periodic  large-
scale  demonstration  flights  at  the  expense  of  limiting  research  to  a  smaller  set
of projects and activities, which option would you find more attractive, and why?
A1. This should not be a black and white choice. In fact, NASA’s swings in empha-
sis  from  large  scale  projects  to  more  basic  research  and  back  again  over  the  years
has made it very difficult for outside researchers to be able to count on NASA sup-
port  and  collaboration  for  the  kind  of  long-term  research  that  NASA  should  be

doing. Instead, like any wise investor, NASA should have a balanced portfolio, with
a sustained basic research agenda, that allows the Agency to identify promising but
longer-term  technologies,  and  a  small  number  of  larger  scale  experiments  that  can
allow industry to better assess when some of these ideas are worth pursuing in the
private  sector.  This  is  a  difficult  line  to  walk,  especially  in  an  era  of  declining  re-
sources  for  aeronautics,  but  it  is  necessary  in  order  that  NASA’s  research  be  both
forward-thinking and relevant.
Q2. During the hearing, it was suggested that ARMD research findings initially not
be broadly disseminated in order to provide domestic companies an opportunity
to capitalize on new discoveries. Do you agree with this concept?
a. If  such  a  policy  were  implemented,  what  effects  would  it  have  on  domestic
companies’ ability to do business with foreign partners and customers? Would
it imperil business relationships and collaborations?

b. How  does  NASA’s  current  policy  compare  with  that  of  other  foreign  govern-
ments  who  underwrite  aeronautics  research  and  development?  Do  they  pub-
licly disseminate new discoveries?

A2. I  am  quite  concerned  that  such  a  policy  would  be  very  difficult  to  implement
and  generally  counter-productive;  it  would  prohibit  many  university  students  from
working  on  NASA  programs,  might  restrict  hiring  by  small  companies  of  excellent
researchers  who  were  not  currently  U.S.  citizens,  and  discourage  collaboration
among some of the top researchers in the world. Clearly, some NASA programs with
direct impact on national security should restrict dissemination of results. The clas-
sification  mechanism  is  well  developed  and  understood  by  industry  and  academia.
An intermediate form of classification is much more problematic. Currently, compa-
nies  working  with  NASA  may  maintain  limited  data  rights  or  government-purpose
rights  in  cases  that  involve  collaborative  research  and  proprietary  data.  Further
limiting  dissemination  of  NASA  research—especially  that  of  a  more  fundamental
nature, isolates NASA researchers from other experts.

Much  of  the  work  done  at  government-supported  aeronautical  research  labora-
tories  in  Germany  (DLR),  France  (ONERA),  and  Japan  (JAXA)  is  broadly  dissemi-
nated and, along with NASA publications, has formed an important knowledge base
on which our research at Stanford is built.
