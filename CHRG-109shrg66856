THE  LIFESAVING  ROLE  OF  ACCURATE 

HURRICANE  PREDICTION  AND  PREPARATION 

TUESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  20,  2005 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON DISASTER PREVENTION AND PREDICTION, 
COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  3:05  p.m.  in  room 
SD–562,  Dirksen  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Jim  DeMint, 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator  DEMINT.  Good  afternoon,  everyone.  Traditionally,  I 
would start the hearing by launching immediately into my opening 
statement, but the tragedy that has befallen the people of the Gulf 
Coast warrants a more different tone. I’ve asked Chaplain Black to 
begin our hearing today. 

Chaplain? 
Chaplain BLACK. Let us pray. 
Lord of the winds and rain, it is because of your mercies that we 
are  not  consumed.  As  natural  disasters  remind  us  that  we  are  fi-
nite,  we  look  to  you,  our  hope  for  years  to  come.  Give  wisdom  to 
the  many  who  seek  to  bring  order  out  of  the  chaos  of  Hurricane 
Katrina.  Remember  also  those  who  are  braced  for  Hurricane  Rita. 
Empower  all  who  are  involved  rebuilding  the  affected  region  to  do 
justly,  to  love  mercy,  and  to  embrace  humility.  Comfort  those  who 
mourn,  and  heal  the  sick  and  injured.  Bring  restoration  to  those 
who  have  been  scarred  emotionally,  particularly  the  children. 
Guide this Disaster Prediction and Prevention Subcommittee in its 
efforts to do your will on Earth, even as it is done in Heaven. 

We pray in Your sovereign name. Amen. 
Senator DEMINT. I’d like to read a statement that’s titled ‘‘Hurri-
cane Local Statement, Urgent: Devastating damage expected. Hur-
ricane  Katrina,  a  most  powerful  hurricane,  with  unprecedented 
strength, rivaling the intensity of Hurricane Camille, in 1969. Most 
of  the  area  will  be  uninhabitable  for  weeks,  perhaps  longer.  At 
least half of well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. 
All  gable  roofs  will  fail.  All  wood-framed,  low-rising  apartment 
buildings  will  be  destroyed.  All  windows  will  be  blown  out.  The 
vast  majority  of  trees  will  be  snapped  or  uprooted.  Only  the  har-
diest will remain standing, but be totally defoliated. Power outages 
will  last  for  weeks,  as  most  power  poles  will  be  down  and  trans-

formers destroyed. Water shortages will make human suffering in-
credible by modern standards.’’ 

Now,  this  wasn’t  a  last-minute  plea  issued  by  emergency  man-
agers  Monday  morning,  this  is  the  verbatim  announcement  from 
the  New  Orleans  Weather  Forecast  Office  20  hours  before  the 
storm hit the city. Sadly, too, it is largely what I saw when I toured 
the region on the 9th of September. 

As  you  can  see  from  the  photos  that  we  have  around  the  room 
today,  the  damage  was  massive,  comprehensive,  and  eerily  similar 
to what was described by the weather service. 

What quickly became clear to me is that television does not accu-
rately  convey  what  happened.  Seeing  a  home  demolished  on  tele-
vision  begins  to  communicate  the  tragedy,  but  when  you  see  60  to 
70  miles  of  that  repeated  over  and  over  again,  it  is  heartbreaking 
and  almost  impossible  to  comprehend.  Entire  neighborhoods  are 
completely  gone,  except  for  concrete  foundations  that  serve  as 
markers  of  what  once  stood.  Every  home  is  a  displaced  family. 
Every  demolished  neighborhood  is  a  community  that  will  never  be 
the same. 

Another realization during the trip is that there are two separate 
disasters  in  the  Gulf.  In  Mississippi,  the  houses  themselves  have 
been  demolished  by  the  wind  and  the  storm,  but  the  land  is  dry. 
In  New  Orleans,  the  homes  are  standing,  but  still  flooded  and  ru-
ined. One thing both locations have in common, though, is that the 
homes  will  never  again  be  habitable.  The  wind-damaged  homes, 
those  that  still  stand,  will  likely  be  declared  a  complete  loss  and 
have to be torn down. In New Orleans, the homes that are flooded 
are  permanently  damaged  and  are  beyond  repair  and  will  have  to 
be torn down, as well. 

And  all  of  this  pales  in  contrast  to  the  human  toll  of  the  storm. 
Hundreds of lives have been lost, families have been separated, an 
entire region of people have been scattered throughout the Nation, 
jobless, homeless, and with no idea of when they will be able to re-
turn home. 

Now,  based  on  what  I  saw,  it’s  clear  that  the  Nation  will  need 
leaders  who  will  work  together  to  solve  problems  today  and  help 
America  become  better  prepared  for  disasters  in  the  future.  The 
last thing we need now is more critics who are trying to blame oth-
ers and make political gains. 

Clearly, our first job is to provide humanitarian relief to the vic-
tims,  to  make  available  all  the  resources  that  are  essential  to  re-
building  communities  and  jobs,  and  to  remove  all  bureaucratic  ob-
stacles  to  getting  the  job  done  as  quickly  as  possible.  Every  Amer-
ican, including every Congressman and Senator, should be involved 
in  this  massive  relief  and  rebuilding  effort.  All  of  us  are  called  on 
for sympathy, sacrifice, and solutions. 

But we can’t stop at just thinking about recovering from this dis-
aster.  We  need  to  be  thinking  about  the  next  disaster.  The  job  of 
this committee is focused on specific aspects of this effort. Our mis-
sion  is  to  oversee  the  Federal  Government’s  role  in  predicting  na-
tional—natural disasters and to develop policies that will minimize 
the loss of life and property when natural disasters occur. This task 
is  crucial,  because  accurate  predictions  will  help  ensure  that  indi-

viduals  are  in  shelters,  and  not  in  their  homes,  when  the  storm 
blows through. 

We’re going to examine, today, how the Federal agencies respon-
sible for predicting the impact of the storm performed; in this case, 
of Katrina. That responsibility falls largely to the National Oceanic 
and  Atmospheric  Administration,  commonly  referred  to  as  NOAA. 
About 2 months ago, in this Subcommittee, Senator Vitter, of Lou-
isiana,  used  NOAA  predictions  to  warn  us  of  the  catastrophic  im-
pact that a Category-4 or -5 hurricane would have if it hit New Or-
leans. The scenario Senator Vitter presented is almost exactly what 
happened  on  August  29.  Sadly,  while  NOAA’s  predictions  and 
warnings for New Orleans have been publicized for almost two dec-
ades,  somehow  it  didn’t  sink  in.  This  disaster  was  predicted,  and 
largely inevitable, yet private citizens and officials at every level of 
government failed to prepare. 

In  fairness  to  everyone  involved,  however,  after  seeing  the  in-
credible scale of the destruction firsthand, we should be grateful for 
the  effective  response  of  thousands  who  helped  to  reduce  the  loss 
of  life.  Without  aggressive  evacuation  efforts—I  apologize,  we  got 
out  of  order  here—grateful  for  those  who  did  respond  and  reduced 
the  loss  of  life.  Without  aggressive  evacuation  efforts,  NOAA  had 
estimated  the  loss  of  life  could  have  been  as  high  as  100,000  in 
New  Orleans  alone.  While  the  focus  of  this  committee  is  natural 
disasters, all Americans must now recognize how vulnerable we are 
to  manmade  disasters.  We  saw  how  a  relatively  small  attack  on 
New York disrupted the entire Nation’s financial markets. We saw 
how  one  hurricane  disrupted  the  energy  supplies  for  a  large  part 
of  the  country  and  placed  a  severe  strain  on  the  Federal  Govern-
ment.  We  must  not  be  surprised  again.  We  must  be  prepared.  Be-
cause, unlike a hurricane, a terrorist will not give us 56 hours’ no-
tice of its point of attack. 

Today,  I’ve  asked  officials  from  NOAA  and  from  the  private  dis-
aster  prediction  community  to  detail  the  predictions  and  prepara-
tions related to Katrina. We want to know what they did well and 
what  they  can  do  better  and  what  they  need  from  us  to  continu-
ously  improve  their  ability  to  prepare  Americans  for  hurricanes, 
tornadoes  and  tsunamis.  It  is  crucial  that  we  get  hurricane  pre-
diction  right.  The  best  defense  our  Nation  has  against  hurricanes 
is accurate prediction as well as effective evacuations. 

I’d  like  to  yield  now  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Commerce  Com-

mittee, and then to our Ranking Member of the Subcommittee. 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  just 
want  to  emphasize,  this  hearing  is  not  intended  to  be  a  forum  to 
discuss  the  FEMA  response  or  any  other  response  to  the  recent 
hurricane. 

We created this Subcommittee to deal with disaster prevention— 
prediction  and  prevention.  And  I  think  we’re  here  to  listen  to  you 
all  tell  us  what  you  predicted,  and  it’s  our  job  to  see  whether  pre-
vention mechanisms are in place to react to what you predict. 

So, I thank you very much for you being here.

STATEMENT OF HON. E. BENJAMIN NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA 
Senator BEN NELSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
First,  I  want  to  say  thank  you  to  Max  Mayfield  and  your  team 
at  the  National  Weather  Service  and  the  National  Hurricane  Cen-
ter.  I  think  everyone  can  agree  that  the  accuracy  of  your  forecast 
significantly  contributed  to  saving  lives  during  this  disaster,  and 
we certainly appreciate that. 

The  human  loss  caused  by  this  storm  certainly  would  have  been 
far  greater  if  not  for  that  accuracy.  In  the  midst  of  the  tragedy 
caused  by  Hurricane  Katrina,  we  have  the  opportunity  today  to 
focus  on  one  area  during  this  disaster  where  things  went  terribly 
right, rather than terribly wrong. 

The  National  Weather  Service  did  an  exceptional  job  in  fore-
casting the storm and predicting its impact point and the devasta-
tion  that  it  would  deliver,  and  I  think  it’s  important  that  we  do 
look at what went right in order to ensure that we keep that course 
as  this  hurricane  season  progresses  and  as  we  look  to  the  future, 
as well. 

Or  course,  the  superb  job  of  the  National  Weather  Service  in 
forecasting  Hurricane  Katrina’s  path  is  greatly  diminished  when 
the information that is given out, sometimes ignored, certainly not 
paid attention to, or isn’t used to ensure measures are put in place 
immediately  to  respond  to  the  aftermath  of  the  storm.  So,  while  I 
think it’s appropriate to examine the stellar job of forecasting that 
was  done  during  Hurricane  Katrina,  I  cannot  help  but  voice  my 
frustration, and, I think, the frustration of so many, by the lack of 
follow-up  to  make  sure  that  they  were  prepared  to  respond  to  a 
Category-4 hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast. 

Chairman DeMint read from the notice about what was expected 
in  the  way  of  a  hurricane  well  in  advance  of  its  coming  to  shore. 
And  so,  there  is  no  question  but  what  the  information  was  there 
early, it was accurate. And I’m interested in learning, today, about 
the  process  that  the  National  Hurricane  Center  used  in  relaying 
the information to Federal, State, and local officials. What informa-
tion was sent, when was it sent, and who received it? 

The  bottom  line  is  that  the  National  Weather  Service  provided 
an  accurate  prediction  and  forecast.  Others  failed  to  coordinate  an 
adequate response. It’s my understanding that the National Weath-
er  Service  forecasted  New  Orleans  and  the  Gulf  Coast  areas  being 
within the cone of strike probability approximately 60 hours before 
landfall.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  first  forecast  Katrina  to 
hit  southeast  Louisiana  as  a  major  hurricane,  with  winds  of  130 
miles  per  hour,  on  Friday,  August  26,  at  10  p.m.  The  actual  track 
would  deviate  little  from  the  predicted  one  for  the  duration  of 
Katrina’s approach. In addition, 24 hours prior to landfall, the cen-
ter  of  the  forecasted  track  was  approximately  25  miles  off  the  ac-
tual  track;  and,  12  hours  prior,  the  forecasted  track  was  less  than 
10 miles off. 

So,  what  I  would  like  to  explore  during  today’s  hearing  is  how 
to  capitalize  on  that  accuracy  and  that  fairly  long  lead  time.  How 
do we ensure that this great forecasting information translates into 
better prevention of loss of life and property, as well as better orga-
nization and reaction to the aftermath.

And so, I hope this hearing today will highlight the truly superb 
job that the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane 
Center did in forecasting Hurricane Katrina. I think it’s important 
that we do so. And I also hope this hearing will shed light on how 
we can better use the information to prevent a repeat of what hap-
pened in the Gulf Coast. 

Obviously,  there  are  other  issues  that  will  have  to  be  addressed 
at  times,  such  as  the  inability  of  communication  to  work  as  well 
after the impact of the storm. The whole question about interoper-
ability  and  intercommunication  will  have  to  be  explored,  as  well. 
But  today  our  focus  is  on  how  we  can  use  the  lead  time  and  the 
prediction in natural disasters. 

Chairman DeMint has already indicated that when you have ter-
rorist  actions,  we  are  not  going  to  have  lead  time.  We’ll  have  to 
deal  with  other  issues,  such  as  alert—National  Alert  Systems  and 
similar  kinds  of  protection.  But  today  our  focus  is  on  the  case  at 
hand. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator DEMINT. Thank you. 
Senator Nelson? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA 

Senator  BILL NELSON.  Mr.  Chairman—by  the  way,  if  you  think 

you’re seeing double, you are. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  BILL NELSON.  This  is  a  topic  of  especially  important 
gravity,  because  the  topic  is  the  lifesaving  role  of  accurate  hurri-
cane prediction. I happen to live in a land that is a peninsula that 
sticks  down  into  the  middle  of  something  known  as  ‘‘Hurricane 
Highway.’’  And  we’re  fortunate  that  we  have  two  of  our  Floridians 
on this panel today. 

You not only have been accurate, your predictions and the infor-
mation that is fed to you in increasing volumes, which is processed 
by  those  onboard  computers  on  those  Hurricane  Hunters,  which 
I’ve  had  the  privilege  of  flying  on,  and  then  beamed,  realtime,  to 
you  by  satellite  at  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  cranked  into 
your  various  computer  models,  has  come  to  give  you  such  pre-
diction of such accuracy that, indeed, it is lifesaving. And if people 
in  the  Nation  didn’t  understand  that  by  virtue  of  what  we’ve  gone 
through  in  Florida—most  recently,  four  within  a  6-weeks’  period— 
they certainly do now. 

But, there are people who want to take Max Mayfield off the air. 
They  don’t  want  him  to  conduct  individual  interviews  with  indi-
vidual  broadcasters  or  individual  networks.  There  are  folks  that 
want to take his website off of the Internet, a website that was es-
tablished  after  a  direction  by  President  Bush  in  2001  that  every 
government agency would have a website. And, in fact, people want 
to take it off if there is a competing commercial interest. 

Now,  it  just  so  happened  that  in  the  first  hurricane  of  this  sea-
son,  Dennis,  that  took  a  bead  back  toward  Pensacola,  ended  up 
drifting a little east of Pensacola, one of those commercial interests 
had  predicted  that  it  was  going  to  New  Orleans.  And  if  that  had 
been the only forecast, because people didn’t have access to the Na-

tional Weather Service website, the people of the Florida northwest 
coast would have let down their guard. 

During  that  6  weeks’  period  last  year,  Max  Mayfield’s  and 
NOAA’s  weather  site  got  nine  billion  hits.  Billion,  with  a  ‘‘B.’’ 
That’s,  by  far,  more  than  any  other  government  website  hits.  The 
only  thing  that  came  close  to  that  was  the  NASA  website,  of  six 
billion hits, when the Mars Rover landed on Mars. 

So,  I  can  tell  you  that  this  Senator—I  don’t  know  what  the 
weather  is  like  in  a  lot  of  other  states,  but  I  know  understanding 
the weather and its accurate prediction is often a matter of life and 
death in Florida. And we’re not going to let people monkey around 
by taking you off the air. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Senator. 
We have a number of witnesses appearing this afternoon who are 
going  to  discuss  with  the  Committee  the  prediction  of  Hurricane 
Katrina  and  provide  their  perspectives  on  how  we  can  continue  to 
have accurate predictions and what we can do to prepare for these 
storms. 

Appearing  before  the  Subcommittee  this  afternoon  is  Mr.  Pat 
Roberts,  President  and  CEO  of  the  Florida  Association  of  Broad-
casters.  Mr.  Roberts  will  be  discussing  the  work  of  the  broadcast 
community  to  communicate  with  communities  before,  during,  and 
after  a  disaster.  He  will  also  discuss  the  crucial  role  broadcasters 
play in disaster preparedness. 

Also  joining  him  is  Dr.  Keith  Blackwell.  Dr.  Blackwell  is  Assist-
ant  Professor  of  Meteorology  at  the  University  of  Southern  Ala-
bama.  Mr.  Blackwell  will  discuss  with  the  Committee  his  perspec-
tives  on  how  we  can  work  to  improve  the  ability  of  the  National 
Hurricane  Center  to  predict  the  landfall  of  major  hurricanes.  He 
will  also  discuss  what  can  be  done  to  improve  the  quality  of  the 
products it produces. 

I  would  also  like  to  introduce  Dr.  Marc  Levitan.  Dr.  Levitan  is 
Director  of  the  Louisiana  State  University  Hurricane  Center.  Dr. 
Levitan  is  joining  us  to  follow  up  on  his  testimony  from  our  last 
hearing  and  to  discuss  the  LSU  Hurricane  Center  and  how  it  has 
been actively involved with the prediction and preparedness activi-
ties surrounding this storm. 

Joining  him  is  Mr.  Windell  Curole.  Mr.  Curole  is  General  Man-
ager  of  the  District  of  Galliano,  Louisiana.  Mr.  Curole  will  discuss 
his extensive work in Louisiana with hurricane preparedness plan-
ning  and  what  he  believes  needs  to  be  done  to  get  citizens  to  take 
the threat posed by hurricanes seriously. 

Finally,  returning  this  afternoon,  is  Mr.  Max  Mayfield.  Mr. 
Mayfield  is  Director  of  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  We  appre-
ciate  him  coming  back  before  the  Subcommittee  today  to  discuss 
the  National  Hurricane  Center’s  work  to  predict  the  landfall  of 
Hurricane  Katrina.  Mr.  Mayfield  came  before  this  committee  in 
June  and  described  the  nightmare  scenario  of  a  major  hurricane 
making  landfall  near  New  Orleans.  Unfortunately,  his  concerns 
about  the  challenges  of  the  terrain,  the  inability  to  evacuate  the 
citizens  of  the  city,  and  the  devastation  of  the  storm  surge  were, 
sadly,  too  well  placed.  I  think  we’ll  all  wish  a  lot  more  people  had 
listened to Mr. Mayfield back in June.

Regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  Nation  completely  heeded  Mr. 
Mayfield’s  warning,  his  work,  and  the  work  of  his  crew  down  in 
Miami,  put  together  a  forecast  that  gave  communities  along  the 
Gulf  Coast  the  ability  to  issue  evacuation  orders  far  in  advance  of 
the  storm  making  landfall.  Because  of  that,  a  lot  of  communities 
evacuated and a lot of lives were saved. 

Mr.  Mayfield,  on  behalf  of  this  committee  and  the  U.S.  Senate, 
I thank you for your work and for getting this forecast right. I hope 
you’ll return to Miami and tell the folks down there that we really 
appreciate  what  they  do  and  that  they  helped  save  a  lot  of  lives. 
With  that,  Mr.  Mayfield,  I  think  I’ll  start  with  you.  If  you  can 
keep your testimony to around 5 minutes—if you need more, let us 
know. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  could  I  suggest  we  listen  to  all 

the witnesses before we ask any questions? 

Senator DEMINT. That’s a good idea. Thank you, sir. 

STATEMENT OF MAX MAYFIELD, DIRECTOR, TROPICAL 
PREDICTION CENTER/NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee, 
I’m  Max  Mayfield,  the  director  of  the  Tropical  Prediction  Center 
and  National  Hurricane  Center  at  Miami.  This  is  part  of  the  Na-
tional  Weather  Service  within  NOAA.  Thank  you  for  inviting  here 
today to discuss NOAA’s role in forecasting and warning the public 
about hurricanes. 

The  catastrophic  devastation  along  the  Gulf  Coast  from  Hurri-
cane  Katrina  is  like  nothing  that  I  have  witnessed.  Words  cannot 
convey  the  physical  destruction  and  the  personal  suffering  in  that 
part  of  our  nation.  However,  without  NOAA’s  National  Weather 
Service  forecast  and  warnings,  the  loss  of  life  would  have  been  far 
greater. 

While  I  will  be  focusing  my  remarks  today  on  forecasting  and 
tracking  Hurricane  Katrina,  NOAA’s  work  does  not  end  there. 
NOAA  assesses  damage  from  storms  and  evaluates  waterways  to 
allow  our  Nation’s  ports  and  waterways  impacted  by  the  storm  to 
open.  NOAA  also  assesses  the  impact  to  the  area’s  fisheries,  sup-
ports hazardous-materials containment and abatement efforts, and 
provides  necessary  data  critical  for  post-storm  recovery  operations. 
Hurricane Katrina began as a tropical depression near the south-
eastern  Bahamas  on  Tuesday,  August  23.  The  National  Hurricane 
Center  tropical  cyclone  forecasts  were  issued  routinely  every  6 
hours,  with  intermediate  updates,  as  necessary,  and  included  nu-
merous text and graphical products. 

The  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted  Katrina 
would  become  a  Category-1  hurricane  before  making  landfall  near 
Miami.  And  then,  once  Katrina  emerged  into  the  Gulf  of  Mexico, 
the  National  Hurricane  Center  hurricane  forecast  correctly  pre-
dicted  re-intensification  of  the  storm.  Within  9  hours,  Katrina  in-
tensified from a tropical storm to a Category-2 hurricane. 

Our forecast track from Sunday morning, August the 27th, about 
2 days before landfall, had the storm curving northward and head-
ed directly toward southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi, and the 
prediction  was  for  Katrina  to  make  landfall  as  a  Category-4  hurri-
cane.

The  actual  track  would  deviate  little  from  this  and  subsequent 
forecasts  for  the  rest  of  Katrina’s  approach.  The  intensity  forecast 
would also prove to be correct. 

At  10  a.m.,  Central  Daylight  Time,  on  Saturday,  August  27,  the 
National Hurricane Center posted a hurricane watch for southeast 
Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. We issued additional 
watches and warnings for Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle soon 
thereafter. After reaching southeast Louisiana as a Category-4 hur-
ricane, Katrina made final landfall along the Louisiana/Mississippi 
border on Monday morning as a Category-3 hurricane. 

As  I  testified  before  this  Subcommittee  on  June  29,  storm  surge 
represents our greatest risk for a large loss of life in the hurricanes 
in  our  country.  Unfortunately,  Katrina  has  reminded  us  of  the 
deadly power of the storm surge. 

I  was  very  saddened  about  the  loss  of  life  caused  by  Hurricane 
Katrina. The reported evacuation rate of near 80 percent, however, 
far  exceeds  the  25  to  50  percent  rates  usually  noted.  This  large 
evacuation  saved  many  lives,  and  did  not  happen  by  accident. 
Rather, it resulted from a long working relationship and open com-
munication  between  NOAA,  the  National  Weather  Service,  the 
emergency-management community at all levels, and the media. 

This  collaboration  is  especially  close  and  complementary  during 
a  hurricane  threat.  For  example,  since  the  1970s  NOAA  has  been 
delivering  and  updating  thousands  of  storm-surge  simulations  it 
generates  for  the  entire  vulnerable  coast,  from  Texas  to  Maine, 
long before any specific event. These storm-surge simulations were 
the  basis  for  the  evacuation  plans  and  the  storm-specific  decisions 
made  by  the  communities  there.  In  addition,  NOAA  provides 
realtime storm-surge information. 

I believe that the high evacuation rate was also due to the broad 
distribution  and  diverse  formats  of  National  Weather  Service  text 
and  graphical  forecast  and  warning  products,  the  more  than  400 
media interviews my staff and I conducted, the more than 900 mil-
lion  hits  the  National  Hurricane  Center  forecast  product  received, 
our  public  website,  and,  very  importantly,  the  interactions  of  the 
local  National  Weather  Service  offices  and  the  National  Hurricane 
Center with emergency managers in the days prior to landfall. 

The  National  Weather  Service  has  partnered  with  FEMA  to  es-
tablish a hurricane liaison team, which is activated at the National 
Hurricane  Center  a  few  days  in  advance  of  any  potential  United 
States  hurricane  landfall,  to  help  coordinate  communications  be-
tween  the  National  Hurricane  Center  and  the  emergency-manage-
ment  community  at  the  Federal  and  State  levels.  Local  National 
Weather  Service  offices  and  forecast  centers  tailor  Hurricane  Cen-
ter  forecasts  and  warning  information  into  pointed,  timely,  and  fo-
cused information for their local emergency managers. These emer-
gency managers and local and State officials consult with National 
Weather  Service  forecasters  and  then  make  their  evacuation  and 
other preparedness decisions. 

Today is September 20, near the historical peak of the hurricane 
season.  To  date,  we’ve  had  17  tropical  storms,  9  of  which  have  be-
come  hurricanes,  and  4  of  those  have  been  major  hurricanes,  at 
Category-3  or  stronger.  We  believe  that  we  will  continue  to  have 
an active season.

Long-term tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic is cyclical. The 
1940s through the 1960s, they experienced an above-average num-
ber  of  major  hurricanes,  while  the  1970s  into  the  mid-1990s  aver-
aged  far  fewer  hurricanes.  The  current  period  of  heightened  activ-
ity could last another 10 to 20 years, or more. This increased hurri-
cane activity since 1995 is due to natural cycles of hurricane activ-
ity  driven  by  the  Atlantic  Ocean  along  with  the  atmosphere  above 
it. 

This  period  of  increased  hurricane  activity  and  growing  coastal 
populations  puts  more  people  at  risk  to  potential  catastrophes  like 
Katrina.  To  counter  these  trends  requires  an  accelerated  research 
and forecast operations program, especially to more accurately fore-
cast periods when storms intensify rapidly, as Katrina did over the 
eastern Gulf of Mexico. 

While  we  must  focus  our  energy  on  addressing  the  impacts  of 
Hurricane  Katrina,  we  must  also  look  to  the  future.  Katrina  will 
not  be  the  last  major  hurricane  to  hit  a  vulnerable  area,  and  New 
Orleans is not the only location vulnerable to a large disaster from 
a hurricane. 

Galveston, Houston, Tampa Bay, southwestern Florida, the Flor-
ida  Keys,  southeastern  Florida,  New  York  City  and  Long  Island, 
and, believe it or not, New England are especially vulnerable. And, 
of course, New Orleans remains vulnerable to future hurricanes. 

At  NOAA,  we  will  continue  our  efforts  to  improve  hurricane 
track,  intensity,  precipitation,  and  storm-surge  forecasting  and 
work with our partners to ensure the best-possible outcome during 
future hurricane events. 

With that, I would just like to add that, Mr. Chairman and mem-
bers  of  this  committee,  I  would  really  like  to  thank  you  for  your 
support to our Nation’s hurricane warning program. It’s greatly ap-
preciated. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Mayfield follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MAX MAYFIELD, DIRECTOR, TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER/ 

NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER 

Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  am  Max  Mayfield,  Director  of 
the  Tropical  Prediction  Center/National  Hurricane  Center.  The  National  Hurricane 
Center  is  a  part  of  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS),  of  the  National  Oceanic 
and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  in  the  Department  of  Commerce.  Thank 
you  for  inviting  me  here  today  to  discuss  NOAA’s  role  in  forecasting,  and  warning 
the  public  about  hurricanes,  as  well  as  NOAA’s  essential  role  and  activities  fol-
lowing landfall. 

The  devastation  along  the  Gulf  Coast  from  Hurricane  Katrina  is  like  nothing  I 
have witnessed before. It is catastrophic. Words cannot convey the physical destruc-
tion  and  personal  suffering  in  that  part  of  our  Nation.  However,  without  NOAA’s 
forecasts and warnings, the devastation and loss of life would have been far greater. 
NOAA’s  forecasts  and  warnings  for  Hurricane  Katrina  pushed  the  limits  of  the 
state  of  the  art  of  hurricane  prediction.  Our  continuous  research  efforts  at  NOAA, 
and  in  partnership  with  other  Federal  agencies,  have  led  to  our  current  predictive 
capabilities and improved ways of describing uncertainty in prediction. But NOAA’s 
work does not end there. NOAA does extensive work assessing damage from storms 
and  evaluating  waterways  to  assist  dredging  operations,  to  open  our  Nation’s  ports 
and waterways impacted by the storm. NOAA also assesses the impact to the areas’ 
fisheries,  supports  hazardous  materials  containment  and  abatement  efforts,  and 
provides necessary data critical for post storm recovery operations.

Tracking and Forecasting Hurricane Katrina 

10 

The  National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  within  the  NWS  has  been  the  centerpiece 
of  our  Nation’s  hurricane  forecast  and  warning  program  for  50  years.  The  mission 
of the NHC is to save lives, mitigate property loss, and improve economic efficiency 
by issuing the best watches, warnings, and forecasts of hazardous tropical weather, 
and by increasing the public’s understanding of these hazards. 

NHC  tropical  cyclone  forecasts  are  issued  every  six  hours  and  include  text  mes-
sages as well as a suite of graphical products depicting our forecasts and the accom-
panying probabilities and ‘‘cone of uncertainty,’’ as it has become known. Hurricane 
Katrina began as a tropical depression near the southeastern Bahamas on Tuesday, 
August  23.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  accurately  predicted  it  would  become  a 
Category 1 hurricane before making landfall near Miami. The storm deluged south-
east  Florida  with  16″  of  rain  in  some  places,  causing  downed  trees,  flooding,  and 
extended power outages as it passed across the southern portion of the state. 

Once  Katrina  re-emerged  into  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  NOAA  hurricane  forecasters 
correctly  predicted  re-intensification  of  the  storm.  Katrina  intensified  more  quickly 
and became stronger than initially predicted. Within nine hours, Katrina intensified 
from a tropical storm, with winds of 70 miles per hour, to a Category 2 storm with 
100 mile per hour winds. 

As  you  can  see  in  the  graphic  below,  our  forecast  track  from  Saturday  morning, 
August  27,  about  two  days  before  landfall,  had  the  storm  curving  northward  and 
headed  directly  toward  southeastern  Louisiana  and  Mississippi.  The  projected  path 
of Katrina aimed directly at southeast Louisiana, and the prediction was for Katrina 
to  make  landfall  as  a  Category  4  hurricane.  The  actual  track  would  deviate  little 
from  this  and  subsequent  forecasts  for  the  rest  of  Katrina’s  approach.  On  average, 
NOAA  forecasts  of  where  Katrina  would  go  were  more  accurate  than  usual,  with 
all  of  the  forecast  tracks  during  the  last  48  hours  lining  up  almost  directly  on  top 
of  the  actual  track.  This  forecast  beats  the  Government  Performance  and  Results 
Act goal established for NOAA hurricane forecasts this year. 

At 10:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) Saturday morning, August 27, the Na-
tional Hurricane Center posted a hurricane watch for southeast Louisiana, including 
the city of New Orleans. The watch extended eastward to Mississippi and Alabama 
that  afternoon.  A  hurricane  watch  means  hurricane  conditions  are  possible  in  the 
specified area, usually within 36 hours. Messages from the National Hurricane Cen-
ter highlighted the potential for this storm to make landfall as a Category 4 or Cat-
egory 5 storm.

Predicting  hurricane  intensity  remains  a  challenge.  Even  though  we  knew  condi-
tions were favorable for the storm to intensify, there was some error in the intensity 
forecast  for  the  eastern  Gulf  due  to  its  rapid  intensification.  While  we  accurately 
predicted the intensity at landfall, there is still more work to be done in improving 
intensity prediction, especially for rapidly intensifying or rapidly weakening storms. 
Storm Surge 

Storm  surge  has  caused  most  of  this  country’s  tropical  cyclone  fatalities,  all  too 
vividly  evident  in  the  past  two  weeks,  and  still  represents  our  greatest  risk  for  a 
large loss of life in this country. Following Hurricane Camille in 1969, NOAA estab-
lished a group that developed and implemented a storm surge model called SLOSH 
(Sea,  Lake,  and  Overland  Surges  from  Hurricanes).  The  SLOSH  model  calculates 
storm  surge  heights  resulting  either  from  historical,  hypothetical  or  actual  hurri-
canes.  SLOSH  incorporates  bathymetry  and  topography,  including  bay  and  river 
configurations, roads, levees, and other physical features that can modify the storm 
surge flow pattern. Comprehensive evacuation studies, conducted jointly by the Fed-
eral  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA),  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers, 
NOAA, and state and local emergency managers, are based on the simulated surges 
computed by SLOSH. 

The  National  Hurricane  Center  introduced  storm  surge  forecasts  for  the  Gulf 
Coast in public advisories at 10:00 a.m. CDT Saturday—32 hours prior to Katrina’s 
landfall in Louisiana. The initial forecast (10:00 a.m. CDT, Saturday, August 28) for 
storm surge was predicted at 15 to 20 feet, locally as high as 25 feet, and that fore-
cast  was  updated  the  following  morning  to  a  range  of  18  to  22  feet,  locally  as  high 
as  28  feet,  when  the  forecast  intensity  for  landfall  was  increased.  ‘‘Large  and  bat-
tering’’ waves were forecast on top of the surge. In addition, the 4:00 p.m. CDT pub-
lic advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center on Sunday, August 28, stated 
that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Actual storm 
surge values are being determined at this time. 

I  know  there  have  been  recent  news  reports  that  I  notified  FEMA  that  the  New 
Orleans’  levees  would  be  breached.  In  fact,  I  did  not  say  that.  What  I  indicated  in 
my briefings to emergency managers and to the media was the possibility that some 
levees  in  the  greater  New  Orleans  area  could  be  overtopped,  depending  on  the  de-
tails of Katrina’s track and intensity. This possibility was also indicated in our advi-
sory products.

Communicating Our Forecasts 

12 

The FEMA/NWS Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT), which is activated at NHC a few 
days  in  advance  of  any  potential  U.S.  hurricane  landfall,  coordinates  communica-
tions  between  NOAA  and  the  emergency  management  community  at  the  Federal 
and  state  levels.  The  HLT  was  established  in  1996.  After  consulting  with  our  local 
weather  service  offices  and  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  emergency  managers 
make  evacuation  and  other  preparedness  decisions.  The  HLT  provides  an  excellent 
way  to  communicate  with  the  large  number  of  emergency  managers  typically  im-
pacted  by  a  potential  hurricane.  This  is  a  critical  effort  to  ensure  emergency  man-
agers and first responders know what to expect. 

The  media  is  our  most  essential  partner  and  helps  us  get  the  information  to  the 
public. Without the media, it would be very difficult to get the information as widely 
distributed. The media provided an invaluable service to the people of the impacted 
Gulf  Coast  by  communicating  National  Hurricane  Center  forecast  and  warning  in-
formation  about  Hurricane  Katrina.  From  Thursday,  August  25,  through  Katrina’s 
landfall  in  Mississippi  on  Monday,  August  29,  NOAA’s  Tropical  Prediction  Center/ 
National  Hurricane  Center  provided  a  total  of  471  television  and  radio  interviews, 
through their media pool or via telephone. 

On  Saturday  evening,  August  27,  I  personally  called  the  Chief  of  Operations  at 
the  Alabama  Emergency  Management  Agency,  as  well  as  the  Governors  of  Lou-
isiana and Mississippi and the Mayor of New Orleans, to communicate the potential 
meteorological  and  storm  surge  impacts  from  Hurricane  Katrina.  In  addition,  the 
National  Hurricane  Center  web  activity,  as  supported  by  NOAA’s  web-mirroring 
project, registered 900 million hits during Katrina. 
NOAA Support Efforts 

NOAA  is  focused  on  improving  the  forecasting  of  hurricane  frequency,  track,  and 
intensity as well as predicting hurricane impacts on life and property. Using a com-
bination  of  atmospheric  and  ocean  observations  from  satellites,  aircraft,  and  all 
available surface data over the oceans, NOAA conducts experiments to better under-
stand  internal  storm  dynamics  and  interactions  between  a  hurricane  and  the  sur-
rounding  atmosphere  and  ocean.  Through  greater  understanding  of  physical  proc-
esses and advanced hurricane modeling, NOAA continually improves models for pre-
dicting  hurricane  intensity  and  track,  in  collaboration  with  Federal  partners,  aca-
demic researchers, and commercial enterprises. These numerical modeling improve-
ments,  once  demonstrated,  are  transitioned  into  operations  at  the  National  Hurri-
cane Center. 

NOAA  Aircraft,  the  W–P3  Orions  and  the  Gulf  Stream  IV,  provided  essential  ob-
servations  critical  to  the  National  Hurricane  Center  forecasters  and  supplement 
U.S. Air Force Reserve Command’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron flights. 
A specialized instrument flown on one of the W–P3s, the Stepped Frequency Micro-
wave Radiometer (SFMR), provided essential hurricane structure, surface wind and 
rain  rate  data  to  hurricane  forecasters  right  up  to  and  following  landfall  in  Lou-
isiana  and  Mississippi.  The  Military  Construction  Appropriations  and  Emergency 
Hurricane  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act,  2005  (Pub.  L.  108–324)  provided 
$10.5M to the Air Force to outfit the complete fleet of Hurricane Hunters with this 
instrument,  the  first  of  these  additional  units  should  be  available  during  the  2006 
Hurricane Season. 

The  Military  Construction  Appropriations  and  Emergency  Hurricane  Supple-
mental Appropriations Act, 2005 also provided funding to NOAA for seven hurricane 
buoys,  which  NOAA  deployed  this  past  year  in  the  Caribbean,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico, 
and the Atlantic. Those new buoys provided us with critical information during this 
active hurricane season. 
NOAA’s Activities After Hurricane Katrina’s Landfall 

Immediately  following  Hurricane  Katrina’s  second  landfall,  several  NOAA  ships 
and aircraft were tasked with assisting in the hurricane response. Our aircraft flew 
damage  assessment  flights  using  a  sophisticated  digital  camera  to  collect  imagery 
to assess damage. Over 5,000 high-resolution images collected by NOAA aircraft are 
assisting  emergency  managers  and  other  agencies  in  recovery  operations  and  long- 
term restoration and rebuilding decisions. 

It  is  also  NOAA’s  responsibility  to  assess  the  damage  to  the  commercial  fishing 
industry  in  that  section  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  We  are  working  closely  with  each  of 
the  impacted  state  resource  agencies  and  commercial  entities  to  assess  the  storm’s 
impacts  to  the  longer-term  social  and  economic  viability  of  local  fishing  commu-
nities.  NOAA  employees  also  are  assisting  recovery  efforts  by  working  with  other 
Federal  agencies  in  planning,  organizing,  and  conducting  oil  spill  and  hazardous 
material response and restoration in the impacted areas of the Gulf.

NOAA  ships  are  tasked  with  surveying  critical  ports  and  waterways  for  depths, 
wrecks and obstructions for navigational safety. NOAA Navigation Response Teams 
were  on  scene  before  the  hurricane  hit  to  survey  for  hazards  and  help  the  U.S. 
Coast  Guard  and  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  re-open  waterways  to  commercial 
and  emergency  traffic.  The  THOMAS  JEFFERSON,  a  highly  specialized  hydro-
graphic  survey  ship  equipped  with  multibeam  and  side  scan  sonar  and  two  28-foot 
launches  for  near  shore  and  mid-water  surveys  will  be  surveying  the  entrances  to 
Pascagoula  and  Gulfport,  Mississippi.  Another  NOAA  ship,  the  NANCY  FOSTER, 
is  outfitted  with  survey  technology  and  is  presently  conducting  wreck  and  obstruc-
tion  surveys  in  Mobile  Bay,  Alabama.  The  efforts  of  these  NOAA  ships  are  critical 
to  rebuilding  the  Gulf’s  economic  infrastructure  by  enabling  vessels  of  all  sizes  to 
pass safely through these waterways thereby allowing emergency materials, oil, and 
commercial  goods  to  make  it  to  their  destinations.  Other  NOAA  ships  and  aircraft 
are  assisting  directly  with  the  recovery  effort  by  providing  fuel,  communications, 
and  supplies  to  NOAA  facilities  as  well  as  temporary  office  space  for  local  emer-
gency responders. 
Outlook for the Future 

Today is September 20, near the historical peak of the hurricane season. To date 
we  have  had  fifteen  tropical  storms,  seven  of  which  have  become  hurricanes,  four 
of  those  have  been  major  hurricanes  at  Category  3  or  stronger.  We  believe  we  will 
continue to have an active season, with a total of l8–21 tropical storms. We believe 
this heightened period of hurricane activity will continue due to multi-decadal vari-
ance,  as  tropical  cyclone  activity  in  the  Atlantic  is  cyclical.  The  1940s  through  the 
1960s  experienced  an  above  average  number  of  major  hurricanes,  while  the  1970s 
into the mid-1990’s averaged fewer hurricanes. The current period of heightened ac-
tivity  could  last  another  10–20  years.  The  increased  activity  since  1995  is  due  to 
natural  fluctuations/cycles  of  hurricane  activity,  driven  by  the  Atlantic  Ocean  itself 
along with the atmosphere above it and not enhanced substantially by global warm-
ing. The natural cycles are quite large with on average 3–4 major hurricanes a year 
in  active  periods  and  only  about  1–2  major  hurricanes  annually  during  quiet  peri-
ods, with each period lasting 25–40 years. 

While  we  have  made  significant  progress  in  hurricane  forecasting  and  warnings, 
we  believe  we  have  more  work  to  do.  From  a  scientific  standpoint,  the  gaps  in  our 
capabilities  fall  into  two  broad  categories:  first,  our  ability  to  assess  the  current 
state  of  a  hurricane  and  its  environment  (analysis),  and  second,  our  ability  to  pre-
dict a hurricane’s future state (the forecast). Finally, we would like to improve pub-
lic preparedness. 
Conclusion 

The government’s ability to observe, predict, and respond quickly to storm events 
is  critical  to  public  safety.  We  must  also  now  look  ahead  to  post-storm  redevelop-
ment  strategies  for  communities  impacted  by  Katrina  and  future  storms  to  help 
manage  and  anticipate  these  extreme  events.  NOAA  has  the  expertise  in  coastal 
management and hazard mitigation, and is committed to working with out partners 
in reducing vulnerability to hurricanes and other coastal storm events. It is critical 
that  we  work  to  protect  and  restore  natural  features  along  the  Gulf  Coast,  such  as 
dunes,  wetlands,  and  other  vegetated  areas  that  offer  protection  against  coastal 
flooding and erosion. 

While we must focus our energy on addressing the impacts of Hurricane Katrina, 
we  also  need  to  look  to  the  future.  Katrina  will  not  be  the  last  major  hurricane  to 
hit a vulnerable area, and New Orleans is not the only location vulnerable to a large 
disaster  from  a  land-falling  hurricane.  Houston/Galveston,  Tampa  Bay,  southwest 
Florida, Florida Keys, southeast Florida, New York City/Long Island, and believe it 
or  not,  New  England,  are  all  especially  vulnerable.  And  New  Orleans  remains  vul-
nerable to future hurricanes. 

At  NOAA  we  will  continue  our  efforts  to  improve  hurricane  track,  intensity,  and 
storm  surge  forecasting,  as  well  as  provide  technical  tools  and  planning  expertise 
to states and local governments. 

With that, I’ll be glad to answer any questions Members may have.

STATEMENT OF DR. KEITH G. BLACKWELL, ASSOCIATE 
PROFESSOR OF METEOROLOGY, COASTAL WEATHER 
RESEARCH CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA 

Dr.  BLACKWELL.  Thank  you  for  asking  me  to  come  talk  to  this 

Ever since I was knee-high, I’ve been a hurricane freak, and I’ve 
now  got  the  opportunity  to  have  more  than  my  share  of  storms  to 
study and forecast. And, unfortunately, there’s quite a bit of heart-
ache  and  anguish  with  the  results  that  these  storms  bring.  But  I 
can  say  that  the  National  Hurricane  Center  did  a  good  job  with 
Hurricane  Katrina.  And  hurricanes,  by  nature,  are  notoriously  dif-
ficult  to  predict.  Within  3  days  of  a  northern–Gulf  Coast  landfall, 
the National Hurricane Center had refined the forecast to the area 
that eventually was impacted by the storm.

Hurricane forecasting has come a long way over the last half cen-
tury. The advent of weather satellites was probably one of the most 
revolutionary developments in hurricane tracking. No longer would 
a storm be undetected over the vast expanse of tropical oceans and 
potentially  strike  an  unsuspecting  community  without  warning. 
Over the last several decades, reconnaissance and research aircraft 
have  provided  storm  location  and  intensity  information  which  was 
useful to hurricane forecasters. 

In addition, these aircraft, combined with coastal Doppler radars, 
have provided large amounts of data which have been useful in un-
derstanding  the  structure  and  evolution  of  the  hurricane’s  severe 
inner core of winds and rainfall. 

The  increased  number  of  weather  buoys  deployed  over  the  Gulf, 
Atlantic, and Caribbean Sea have helped to provide better coverage 
in  a  region  where  very  few,  if  any,  weather  observations  existed. 
As computer capabilities have become larger and faster, sophisti-
cated  weather  forecast  models  have  used  much  of  the  increased 
weather data available to provide multi-day forecasts of tropical cy-
clones. 

Here is an example of the expansion of hurricane forecasting lead 
time  which  has  occurred  over  the  last  quarter  century  for  various 
storms  which  struck  the  north-central  Gulf  Coast,  beginning  with 
Hurricane  Frederic,  in  1979.  Believe  it  or  not,  looking  at  those  old 
advisories, which I have in my library, they had 18 to 20 hours ad-
vance  notice  of  where  the  storm  was  going  to  cross  the  coast.  The 
forecasts only went out that far, less than a day. But then, shortly 
after  that,  by  the  time  Hurricane  Elena,  in  1985,  struck  the  Mis-
sissippi  and  Alabama  coast,  the  forecast  tracks  had  gone  out  to  5 
days—or,  excuse  me,  to  3  days.  And  then,  of  course,  by  the  time 
Katrina  came  along,  the  forecasts  were  attempting  to  predict  5 
days into the future. 

Theoretically,  with  these  longer-range  forecasts,  communities 
and  the  public  have  greater  lead  time  in  order  to  begin  preparing. 
However,  I’m  not  so  sure  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  public  has 
the  confidence  necessary  in  these  multi-day  forecasts  to  motivate 
them to begin early preparation. 

With  Katrina,  last  month,  the  3-day  forecast  was  much  more 
helpful in correctly portraying Katrina’s actual landfall threat than 
most  of  the  5-day  forecasts  issued  for  that  storm.  At  times,  the  5- 
day  forecasts  can  be  very  misleading,  when  the  predictability  of 
that particular atmospheric situation may only be 3 days. 

Starting  in  2004,  forecast  outlooks  were  expanded  from  3  to  5 
days. Having personally produced numerous forecasts for industrial 
clients on all storms threatening the U.S. since 1997, I, personally, 
do  not  believe  a  5-day  forecast  should  be  produced  for  every  trop-
ical cyclone, assuming that that tropical cyclone’s going to be alive 
for the next 5 days. 

There are some storms which are absolutely unpredictable at the 
4-  and  5-day  point.  Many  of  these  difficult  storms  are  embedded 
within  weak  steering  currents  or  within  environments  displaying 
moderate vertical wind shear. Some examples are presented in my 
testimony, which I submitted. 

I  believe  that  when  5-day  forecasts  are  generated  in  situations 
when  the  atmosphere  is  not  predictable  out  to  that  range,  public

cynicism of hurricane forecasts grow, eventually leading to mistrust 
and  inaction  by  many.  I  believe  each  storm  should  be  forecast  out 
for 3 days, regardless of the predictability. However, I believe that 
it  would  serve  the  public  much  better  if  forecasts  out  to  4  and  5 
days  were  only  issued  when  the  confidence  of  the  forecast  is  rel-
atively high at that timeframe. 

A confidence gauge could be developed by calculating the scatter, 
or standard deviation, of the more reliable hurricane forecast track 
models at the 5-day forecast point. If the scatter was within accept-
able  limits,  then  we  should  proceed  with  the  4-  or  5-day  forecast. 
But, otherwise, the forecast should be limited to only 3 days. 

We  have  come  a  long  way  with  track  forecasting  of  hurricanes, 
but  much  still  remains—but  there  still  are  often  severe  limits  to 
our skill several days into the future. Much more work remains. 

So far, I’ve only discussed hurricane track forecasting. There are 
many  other  aspects  of  a  hurricane  forecast  in  which  we  display 
very little skill. These include intensity, size, storm surge, and pre-
cipitation.  There  is  much  more  data  collection  and  research  that 
needs  to  be  accomplished  in  order  to  predict  these  storms  better. 
Using  a  baseball-game  analogy,  we  are  roughly  to  second  base  in 
track  forecasting.  That’s  what  we  do  best,  I  believe,  is  track  fore-
casting. But we’re nowhere near perfect. 

The  National  Hurricane  Center  has  a  very  tough  job  with  these 
storms.  They’re  incredibly  fickle  beasts,  and  they  really  rise—the 
folks,  Max  Mayfield  and  folks  down  there  at  the  National  Hurri-
cane  Center  really  rise  to  the  occasion,  often  under  very,  very  dif-
ficult circumstances. 

Maybe, though, we’re approaching first base in our ability to pre-
dict intensity and storm surge. But, often, we haven’t even left the 
batter’s  box  when  it  comes  to  accurate  rainfall  distribution,  storm- 
size  fluctuations,  and  the  evolution  of  the  inner-core  structure  of 
the storm. 

One  of  the  biggest  drawbacks  to  hurricane  prediction  is  the  lack 
of  quality  data  in  and  around  the  storm.  These  storms  form  over 
data-void  tropical  oceans  where  weather  observations  to  the  accu-
racy  and  resolution  needed  by  computer  prediction  models  are  es-
sentially nonexistent most of the time. If we cannot even accurately 
specify  the  present  conditions  of  the  storm  as  it  exists  today,  how 
can we expect a computer to take this information—this incomplete 
data and generate an accurate forecast? 

More weather data in and around the storm is extremely impor-
tant to increasing our ability to better understand and predict hur-
ricanes.  Significantly  more  quality  data  is  needed  than  what  pres-
ently exists today. 

We  also  need  more  research  into  computer  simulations  of  hurri-
canes, which then will have direct benefits to operational hurricane 
forecasters.  Presently,  computers  are  too  slow  and  do  not  have  the 
necessary  data  density  to  predict  hurricanes  with  the  accuracy 
needed for the public to confidently begin early preparatory action. 
In  order  to  speed  up  computer  hurricane  forecast  calculations  so 
that the forecast is available in a timely manner, we end up taking 
many  shortcuts  on  how  important—on  how  important  physical 
processes are calculated or represented in a model. These shortcuts

lead  to  significant  forecast  errors  and  also  often  lead  to  very  little 
continuity between model forecasts. 

We  also  need  to  come  up  with  a  four-pronged  scale  to  rate  the 
destructive  potential  of  hurricanes,  which  will  include  a  separate 
indicator  for  wind,  storm  surge,  flooding,  and  storm  size.  The 
Saffir–Simpson  scale  is  not  representative  of  the  true  impact  of  a 
hurricane.  Being  only  one  number,  it  really  doesn’t  tell  the  story, 
as I think we’re seeing with Katrina, of what a hurricane can real-
ly do at landfall. 

And, just to show you a storm that should not have a 5-day fore-
cast  attributed  to  it,  this  is  Hurricane  Ophelia,  from  a  few  days 
ago,  off  the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States.  Those  are  the  track 
models.  Those  are  the  track  model  forecasts,  as  presented  here. 
They look like a spider web. What are you going to do with a storm 
that has that kind—where your guidance is like that? Fortunately, 
Katrina,  for  the  most  part,  was  much  better  behaved  and  did  not 
have  that  kind  of  scatter.  But  this  kind  of  situation  presents  us, 
time and time and time again—and with Katrina, we did have ade-
quate  warning  to  get  people  out  of  the  way,  but  they  needed  to 
heed that warning. 

But, with some storms in the future, we’re going to have a prob-
lem with getting people out of the way, because the storm is going 
to do something very unexpected, given the problems we have with 
computer forecast simulations. 

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  KEITH G.  BLACKWELL,  ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF 
METEOROLOGY,  COASTAL WEATHER RESEARCH CENTER,  UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH 
ALABAMA 
The  National  Hurricane  Center  did  a  good  job  with  Hurricane  Katrina.  Hurri-
canes,  by  nature,  are  notoriously  difficult  to  predict.  Within  3  days  of  a  northern 
Gulf coast landfall, the National Hurricane Center had refined the forecast landfall 
to the area that eventually was impacted by the storm. 

Hurricane forecasting has come a long way over the last half century. The advent 
of  weather  satellites  was  probably  one  of  the  most  revolutionary  developments  in 
hurricane  tracking.  No  longer  would  a  storm  be  undetected  over  the  vast  expanse 
of  tropical  oceans  and  potentially  strike  an  unsuspecting  community  without  warn-
ing.  Over  the  last  several  decades,  reconnaissance  and  research  aircraft  have  pro-
vided  storm  location  and  intensity  information  which  was  useful  to  hurricane  fore-
casters. In addition, these aircraft, combined with coastal Doppler radars, have pro-
vided  large  amounts  of  data  which  has  been  useful  in  understanding  the  structure 
and  evolution  of  the  hurricane’s  severe  inner  core  of  winds  and  rainfall.  The  in-
creased  number  of  weather  buoys  deployed  over  the  Gulf,  Atlantic,  and  Caribbean 
Sea have helped to provide better coverage in a region where very few if any weath-
er observations existed. 
5-Day Forecast 

As  computer  capabilities  became  larger  and  their  speed  faster,  sophisticated 
weather  forecast  models  have  used  much  of  this  increased  weather  data  to  provide 
multi-day forecasts of tropical cyclones. Here is an example of the expansion of hur-
ricane  forecasting  lead  time  which  has  occurred  over  the  last  quarter  century  for 
various storms which struck the north-central Gulf coast: 

1979—Hurricane Frederic: 1-day forecast (only 18–20 hours lead time). 
1985—Hurricane Elena: 3-day forecast. 
1998—Hurricane Georges: 3-day forecast. 
2005—Hurricane Katrina: 5-day forecast. 

Theoretically, with these longer-range forecasts, communities and the public have 
greater  lead  times  in  order  to  begin  preparing.  However,  I  am  not  so  sure  that  the

vast  majority  of  the  public  has  the  confidence  necessary  in  these  forecasts  to  moti-
vate them to begin early preparation. 

With  Katrina  last  month,  the  3-day  forecast  was  much  more  helpful  in  correctly 
portraying Katrina’s landfall location than most of the 5-day forecasts. For example: 
• From  5  p.m.  Tuesday  (23  Aug)—11  a.m.  Wednesday  (24  Aug):  5-day  forecasts 
displayed some skill bringing the storm across Florida and into the eastern Gulf 
of Mexico (See Figure 1). 
• After that, the 5-day forecast was generally not helpful in portraying the threat 
to  New  Orleans  and  the  Mississippi  Gulf  Coast.  Instead,  the  5-day  forecasts 
generally portrayed an incorrect threat to the Florida Big Bend and eastern por-
tions of the Florida Panhandle (see Figure 2). 
• By  the  time  a  serious  threat  to  New  Orleans  became  apparent,  the  storm  was 
within 3 days of landfall. At 5 p.m. Friday (26 Aug), the storm is within 3 days 
of landfall and the 3-day forecast shows significant skill from this point forward 
with portraying a serious threat to the SE Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama 
coast.  Thus,  the  3-day,  not  the  5-day  forecast,  was  useful  in  portraying 
Katrina’s threat to the Louisiana/ Mississippi/ Alabama coastline (see Figure 3). 
Starting  in  2004,  forecast  outlooks  were  expanded  from  3  days  to  5  days.  Having 
operationally  produced  numerous  forecasts  for  industrial  clients  on  all  storms 
threatening the U.S. since 1997, I personally do not believe a 5-day forecast should 
be  produced  for  every  tropical  cyclone  (assuming  5  or  more  days  of  existence  re-
main).  There  are  some  storms  which  are  absolutely  unpredictable  at  the  4  and/or 
5 day point. Many of these ‘‘difficult’’ storms are embedded within very weak steer-
ing currents, or within environments displaying moderate vertical wind shear. 

Initially, Katrina’s steering currents were fairly well defined, as evidenced by the 
general  agreement  (i.e.,  the  general  lack  of  scatter  in  the  forecast  tracks)  between 
many  models  (see  Figure  4).  In  this  case,  the  5-day  forecast  certainly  indicated  a 
possible  future  threat  to  the  north-central  Gulf  coast  area  (see  Figure  1).  A  couple 
of  days  later  however,  as  scatter  between  model  forecasts  increased,  the  accuracy 
of Katrina’s 5-day forecast went down as the northeast Gulf coast was now targeted 
(see Figure 5 and compare to Figure 2). Finally, after Katrina moved into the Gulf, 
the model forecast scatter once again began decreasing, and the threat shifted back 
to  the  north-central  Gulf  coast  (see  Figure  6  and  compare  to  Figure  3).  But  by  this 
time, the storm was within 3 days of landfall. 

Hurricane  Ophelia  last  week  is  an  example  of  an  unpredictable  storm  in  which 
a  forecast  should  be  limited  to  only  3  days  during  certain  times  of  the  storm’s  life. 
Ophelia was embedded in weak steering currents and the scatter of the model fore-
cast  tracks  was  huge  (Figure  7).  The  terribly  large  scatter  of  forecast  tracks  indi-
cates that there should very little confidence in the storm’s 5-day forecast; therefore, 
the public should only receive a 3-day forecast instead of the 5- day forecast as por-
trayed  in  Figure  8.  Instead  of  striking  South  Carolina  and  moving  well  inland,  the 
storm actually grazed the North Carolina coast before moving out to sea. 

The  National  Hurricane  Center’s  Tropical  Cyclone  Discussion  from  5  a.m.  EDT, 
Friday,  September  9,  2005,  indicates  the  forecaster’s  lack  of  confidence  in  the  fore-
cast track. 

. . . GIVEN  THE  LACK  OF  CONSISTENCY  IN  MODEL  GUIDANCE  THUS 
FAR  WITH  THIS  STORM . . . I  HAVE  ONLY  MADE  A  MODEST  WEST-
WARD ADJUSTMENT WITH THE OFFICIAL FORECAST AT THIS TIME. IT 
IS  TOO  EARLY  TO  BE  SPECIFIC  ABOUT  WHICH  AREAS  MIGHT  ULTI-
MATELY  BE  AFFECTED  BY  OPHELIA . . . BUT  THE  PROXIMITY  OF 
THIS  CYCLONE  TO  THE  COAST  AND  THE  WEAK  STEERING  CURRENTS 
DICTATES  THAT  INTERESTS  FROM  FLORIDA  THROUGH  THE  CARO-
LINAS  WILL  NEED  TO  MONITOR  OPHELIA  FOR  THE  NEXT  SEVERAL 
DAYS. . . .

The  graphic  did  not  display  this  level  of  uncertainty  any  different  than  it  would 
a more confident forecast, and most people see the graphic and not the Tropical Cy-
clone  Discussion.  Thus,  a  4-  and  5-day  forecast  track  to  South  Carolina  is  mis-
leading, even if there are huge margins of error depicted on the graphic. These mar-
gins of error (depicted by the white circular line surrounding the forecast track) are 
the same for every forecast, regardless of the true confidence of the forecast. 

Yet,  there  are  other  storms  in  which  the  steering  currents  are  well  established 
and  the  storm  is  predictable  with  great  accuracy  out  to  5  days.  Hurricane  Emily  is 
an example of a storm with a highly predictable track (see Figures 9 and 10). 

I  believe  that  the  5-day  forecast  product  contributes  to  public  cynicism  and  too 
often tends to give the public the impression that ‘‘The 5-day forecast may have the

storm  pointed  at  my  city  today,  but  it  always  changes;  I  will  wait  until  tomorrow 
or  the  next  day  before  I  begin  to  take  any  action.  After  all,  I  fully  expect  the  track 
to  be  pointed  somewhere  else  tomorrow,  so  why  should  I  begin  to  prepare  now?  ‘’ 
I  believe  some  of  this  mentality  may  have  affected  actions  by  both  the  public  and 
public officials prior to Katrina’s landfall. 

I  believe  each  storm  should  be  forecast  at  least  out  to  3  days,  regardless  of  the 
predictability.  However,  I  believe  that  it  would  serve  the  public  much  better  if  the 
4  and/or  5  day  forecast  were  only  issued  when  the  confidence  of  the  forecast  is  rel-
atively  high  at  that  time  range.  A  ‘‘confidence  gauge’’  could  be  developed  by  calcu-
lating the ‘‘scatter’’ or ‘‘standard deviation’’ of the more reliable track models at the 
4- and 5-day forecast points. If the ‘‘scatter’’ was within acceptable limits, then pro-
ceed  with  the  4-  or  5-day  forecast,  but  otherwise  limit  the  forecast  to  only  3  days. 
I  have  only  discussed  forecast  tracks  in  the  above  paragraphs.  The  success  with 
intensity  forecasting  is  much  less  than  with  track  forecasting.  There  is  much  more 
data collection and research that needs to be accomplished in order to better predict 
these storms. 

Increasing  the  frequency  of  Mexican  weather  balloon  launches  (to  6-  or  12-hour 
intervals,  rather  than  the  current  24-hour  intervals)  when  hurricanes  are  present 
in  the  Atlantic  would  help  increase  the  accuracy  of  measuring  steering  currents 
which later might impact the hurricane track. 
New Upgrade Needed for Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale 

A  new  hurricane  intensity  scale  is  needed  in  order  to  better  relate  the  expected 
effects  of  a  hurricane  on  the  threatened  population,  thus  better  preparing  them  for 
the storm and improving their ability to evacuate. 

Need a new scale to rate hurricane effects at landfall. Need alternative estimates 

of storm intensity which better define what a storm is capable of doing.

include: 
—Wind 
—Storm surge 
—Rainfall and inland flooding. 
—Storm size 

All  of  these  need  to  be  independent  of  each  other  and  able  to  stand  on  their  own 

merit, depending on the situation. 
Much More Storm Intensity Research Needed

fall without doing much wind damage. 

• How strong are hurricanes? This is a very elusive question. 
• Some  storms  appear  as  though  they  should  have  strong  winds,  but  make  land-
• Some  storms  produce  wind  damage  which  far  surpasses  their  expected  inten-
• Some  storms  bring  their  strong  winds  to  the  ground  and  others  don’t.  We  can-
not  predict  this.  When  it  comes  to  wind  damage  and  effects  of  the  wind  on  the 
storm surge, it is the wind speeds which occur at the ground (or ocean surface) 
that count. 
• New  tools  on  board  aircraft  are  being  used  to  measure  winds  close  to  the  sur-

face of the ocean: 
—Global  Positioning  System  Dropsondes  have  provided  unparalleled  views  of 
vertical wind profiles in hurricanes, particularly near the surface. 
—Stepped  frequency  microwave  radiometers  (SFMR)  have  recently  been  placed 
on board NOAA research aircraft. 

—Presently  this  type  of  equipment  is  needed  on  Air  Force  C–130  hurricane 

hunter aircraft. 

—The SFMR provides surface wind speed estimates over the ocean. 
—Good calibration of these SFMR wind measurements only exists for low and 
moderate  wind  speed  situations.  Additional  work  needs  to  be  done  to  cali-
brate  this  instrument  for  high  wind  speeds,  typical  of  intense  hurricanes. 
Rainfall estimates are also possible with the SFMR.

—Important: The SFMR and other wind profiling instruments are critical to de-
termining  wave  height  out  in  the  open  ocean  1  or  2  days  before  landfall.  In 
Katrina’s  case,  waves  generated  while  Katrina  was  a  Category  5  over  the  cen-
tral Gulf 1 or 2 days prior to landfall probably helped enhance the storm surge 
above  what  a  weakening  Katrina  would  have  been  capable  of  when  it  made 
landfall. In other words, the fact that Katrina was a large Category-5 hurricane 
in  the  central  Gulf  probably  led  to  a  larger  storm  surge  on  the  Gulf  coast  well 
above  what  would  probably  have  happened  had  Katrina  never  reached  Cat-
egory-5.  Assuming  that  Katrina  crossed  the  Mississippi  coast  as  a  high  Cat-
egory-3  or  low  Category-4  storm,  the  storm  surge  was  probably  much  higher 
with  this  storm  because  it  had  a  recent  history  as  a  large  Category-5  storm. 
Had  the  storm  not  been  so  intense  over  the  central  Gulf  1–2  days  before  land-
fall,  there  probably  would  have  been  a  smaller  surge  (everything  else  being 
equal). Thus, the ability to measure the size and strength of the storm is critical 
to storm surge prediction. 

• UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) offer great promise of long-term direct sam-
pling  of  hurricanes,  provided  they  are  rugged  enough  to  survive  the  hostile 
weather  environment.  Because  of  their  small  size  and  low  speed,  they  may  be 
better suited for remaining in the eye and measuring central pressure and tem-
perature,  rather  than  venturing  into  the  rougher  weather  outside  the  eye  to 
measure the maximum winds. Testing is ongoing. 

• Storm  winds  near  the  ground  in  a  landfalling  hurricane  are  often  difficult  to 

assess. 
—The storms produce power outages and severe damage which often either ren-
ders  wind  equipment  useless  in  the  core  of  hurricanes,  unless  they  are  ‘‘hard-
ened’’  to  handle  such  extreme  events.  However,  when  observations  are  avail-
able,  they  are  invaluable  for  both  assessing  the  storm  strength  and  structure, 
and also for research. 
• Coastal  and  portable  Doppler  radars  are  extremely  useful  tools  for  assessing 
storm  strength,  but  often  cannot  sample  the  atmosphere  at  low  enough  levels 
to determine the wind speed near the ground. 
• Mesonets  (mesoscale  networks),  consisting  of  a  fairly  dense  array  of  low-cost 
weather  stations,  are  currently  being  set  up  by  individual  universities  using 
grant money. Mesonets serve the dual purpose of providing operational and re-
search  benefits,  particularly  when  hurricanes  make  landfall.  In  addition,  they 
are good for public relations because the public likes to see local weather obser-
vations close to them. Dr. Kimball, at the University of South Alabama, is pres-
ently installing a mesonet along the north-central Gulf coast. She has had many 
requests  from  the  public  wanting  access  to  her  website  which  displays  the  ob-
servations  taken  by  these  instruments.  Locating  these  instruments  at  schools 
also allows and educational component to be realized by teachers and students. 
During  landfalling  hurricane  situations,  these  weather  stations  can  provide  ex-
tremely  important  wind  and  other  weather  information  which  can  be  used  to 
determine  the  severity  of  the  storm  and  later  incorporated  into  research  which 
furthers our understanding of these storms. 
—Ken Crawford has been appointed the COOP modernization person at NOAA, 
but that office needs to be expanded. They are often too busy to pursue collabo-
ration efforts with universities in hurricane-prone regions. 
—These observations are critical to improving the accuracy of computer simula-
tions  attempting  to  re-create  the  structure,  intensity,  surge,  and  rainfall  of  ac-
tual storms which have made landfall. 
—Also, these mesonets need funding for infrastructure and for long-term main-
tenance.  After  a  university’s  mesonet  grant  expires,  the  stations  may  deterio-
rate, lose calibration, and eventually die. 

Landfall Forecast Focus Needs to be Emphasized 

• The  accuracy  of  hurricane  forecasts  continues  to  slowly  improve;  however,  the 
accuracy  that  really  counts  for  most  interests  is  the  projected  landfall  location 
and  intensity.  This  is  where  the  most  significant  emphasis  should  continue  to 
be placed. Much more research needs to be done to provide more accurate guid-
ance to emergency managers and the public about what to expect as the hurri-
cane approaches. 
—Obviously,  accurate  track  and  intensity  forecasts  are  critical  at  landfall,  but 
other less-obvious challenges are important too.

—Better  forecasting  of  size  and  structural  changes  in  hurricanes  will  allow 
for improved forecasts for the onset of tropical storm-force winds and early 
water rise at the coastline. 

—Onset of these winds effects evacuation efforts in the path of the storm (ex-
ample: Often ferries and certain bridges used for evacuation may be closed 
early due to winds and/or tides exceeding limits, etc . . .) 

Numerical Hurricane Modeling 

Much  of  the  future  of  hurricane  prediction  lies  in  better  observations  and  more 
powerful numerical computer modeling. Weather data is seriously lacking in the vi-
cinity of tropical cyclones. These cyclones form over data-void regions of the tropical 
and  sub-tropical  oceans  where  weather  observations  are  scarce.  This  weather  data 
must be easily convertible into quantitative data compatible for use by weather fore-
cast computers. 

• Weather data is needed over vast regions surrounding the hurricane. The newly 
acquired NOAA Gulfstream jet performs some of this function, but it is not fea-
sible  to  keep  this  aircraft  continuously  deployed.  Satellite  also  can  help,  but 
most of this data alone cannot provide the quantitative accuracy or vertical de-
tail  needed  by  numerical  models.  There  are  some  platforms,  such  as  the 
QuikScat instrument deployed on low-flying polar orbiting satellites which pro-
vide  good  estimates  of  surface  winds  over  the  oceans;  however,  there  are  two 
major shortcomings which need to be overcome with more research: 
a. The polar-orbiting satellite only allows twice-a-day fly-overs at best, and large 
data-void  swaths  exist  over  tropical  oceans  in  expansive  regions  between  the 
successive  orbital  paths  of  the  satellite.  Often,  a  hurricane  will  fall  within  one 
of  these  data-void  swaths  and  no  wind  data  will  be  collected  from  the  vicinity 
of the hurricane for maybe a day or two. 
Possible solutions: 

—Equip several polar-orbiting satellites with QuikScat 
—Place  QuikScat  on  geostationary  satellites,  thus  allowing  continuous  wind 

measurements from the same oceanic region. 

b. The QuikScat wind measurements are degraded in areas of heavy rain. Since 
heavy  rainfall  is  common  in  hurricanes,  very  limited  information  is  available 
from this instrument within the hurricane itself. 

• The Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) satellite is a special satellite 
which  has  been  in  a  low  earth  orbit  which  circles  the  tropical  regions  of  the 
globe. This operational satellite was recently targeted for elimination, but some 
funds were found to extend its life. This type of satellite needs to continue oper-
ations in the future over hurricane-prone regions of the tropical and sub-tropical 
oceans. 

• For  more  accurate  forecasts  of  the  inner-core  structure  of  a  hurricane,  better 
techniques need to be developed for inserting (known as ‘‘bogusing’’) a hurricane 
vortex  into  numerical  models.  Better  data  incorporation  and  data  assimilation 
of  a  representative  hurricane  vortex  is  needed  in  numerical  models.  However, 
in  order  to  bogus  a  more  accurate  vortex  into  a  model,  better  data  quality  and 
quantity is needed in the inner core of the hurricane. 
• Better  computer  resources  are  needed  to  refine  forecast  models.  Currently,  the 
operational  resolution  and  parameterizations  of  operational  models  are  inad-
equate  to  provide  routinely  accurate  hurricane  forecasts,  particularly  with  re-
gards to structural and intensity changes. Faster computers and more complete 
numerical  models  are  needed  for  more  detailed  and  accurate  hurricane  fore-
casting. 
• Observations are needed to refine model parameters. NOAA P–3 Orion research 
aircraft  fly  at  a  maximum  altitude  of  5  km,  but  observations  of  microphysical 
cloud  structure  (e.g.,  microphysics)  above  that  level  are  needed  due  to  their 
huge  impacts  on  storm  structure.  The  NOAA  Gulfstream  aircraft  is  capable  of 
flying at some of these higher altitudes, but presently it only samples areas out-
side  the  immediate  storm  environment  and  not  directly  within  the  hurricane. 
• Planetary  boundary  layer  (PBL)  parameters  need  to  be  refined  for  high  wind 
regimes;  exchange  coefficients  currently  in  use  are  for  low  winds,  not  the  ex-
treme  wind  speeds  characteristic  of  hurricanes.  Plus,  there  is  a  need  for  quan-
titatively  measuring  and  incorporating  into  models  correct  values  of  sea  spray 
and wave roughness.

• Correct modeling of hurricane structure, size, and intensity is crucial if one ever 
expects  to  correctly  predict  flooding  rainfall,  storm  surge  and  wind  speeds  of 
landfalling hurricanes. 

National Hurricane Center Public Relations 

The Tropical Prediction Center National Hurricane Center (NHC) needs an expe-
rienced  tropical  meteorologist  who  is  a  professional  public  relations  specialist.  This 
person would be skilled at working with the media. Presently, this position is often 
filled by the NHC director himself (such as Mr. Mayfield). The NHC director needs 
to remain in the trenches with the hurricane forecasters. I do not believe that hurri-
cane  forecasts  are  improved  by  the  NHC  director  having  to  devote  so  much  time 
with  the  media  when  significant  forecast  challenges  are  always  presented  in 
landfalling  hurricane  situations.  Public  relations  is  extremely  important  in  con-
vincing the public that they should prepare for a hurricane, but it should not detract 
from  the  core  NHC  mission:  accurate  hurricane  forecasts.  (This  is  not  to  say  that 
Mr. Mayfield does less than a stellar job in front of the camera.)

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Dr. Blackwell. 
Dr. Levitan? 

STATEMENT OF DR. MARC L. LEVITAN, DIRECTOR, 

HURRICANE CENTER/CHARLES P. SIESS, JR. ASSOCIATE 
PROFESSOR OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, LOUISIANA STATE 
UNIVERSITY; PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR 

WIND ENGINEERING 

Dr.  LEVITAN.  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Subcommittee, 
my  name  is  Marc  Levitan,  Director  of  the  LSU  Hurricane  Center. 
I’d  first  like  to  discuss  the  role  of  the  LSU  Hurricane  Center  in 
operational  response.  On  Saturday  morning,  August  27,  we  were 
activated by the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emer-
gency  Preparedness  to  provide  operational  support.  Our  team  in-
cludes  the  LSU  Hurricane  Center,  the  Southern  Regional  Climate 
Center, LSU Earth Scan Lab, and the Center for the Study of Pub-
lic Health Impacts of Hurricanes. 

The support that we provided in the State Emergency Operations 
Center,  from  before  the  storm  until  well  after  the  storm,  included 
satellite  storm  tracking,  local  meteorological  condition  information 
and support, storm-surge estimation, wind-damage estimation, con-
sultations  with  technical  information  on  evacuation  and  sheltering 
decisions, and many other technical aspects. 

One  of  the  most  important  aspects  that  we  were  able  to  provide 
is  some  additional  information  on  storm-surge  modeling.  Let  me 
pull that up here. And as—based on the forecast advisory, number

16,  we  use  the  ADCIRC,  a  different  storm-surge  model,  to  develop 
storm-surge flooding estimates on the LSU supercomputer. 

Now,  the  information—as  important  as  the  track  forecasting  is, 
of  course,  we  can’t  do  any  kind  of  good  storm-surge  estimations 
without having a good track. And so, we start with the track infor-
mation  developed  by  the  National  Hurricane  Center.  And  this 
model provides—in the same way that we just saw, there are many 
different  models  available  to  predict  where  the  storm  will  go—this 
is—becomes  a  second  modeling  tool  that’s  available  to  us  now,  to 
have  at  least  two  models  that  can  be  used  operationally  to  inves-
tigate  what  the  possible  storm-surge  flooding  is,  in  addition  to  the 
NOAA storm-surge model. 

We  briefed  this—I  actually—as  our  team  was  developing  these 
models  and  running  this  information,  I  was  in  the  EOC,  briefing 
this.  And,  as  of  Saturday—this  was  a  Saturday  afternoon  briefing, 
and  it  indicated  some  storm-surge  flooding  in  the  lower  parishes, 
but  no  overtopping  of  the  levees.  However,  we  did  note  that  levee 
overtopping certainly was possible, as the note on the graphic indi-
cates. 

By advisory 18, which we briefed very late Saturday night, close 
to midnight, that one did show, in the New Orleans east area, over 
here—we  showed  overtopping  through  the  Mississippi  River/Gulf 
outlet, and it showed a significant extent of flooding. 

Now, I will say that none of the models—and we just do not have 
the  technology  yet—none  predict  breaching  of  the  levee  or  failure 
of  the  levee.  The  flooding  indicated  by  all  these  models  is  simply 
due  to  overtop.  I  will  mention  that  we  are  working  today,  have 
been  working  over  the  last  week,  to  upgrade  our—the  ADCIRC 
model  to  account  for  the  damaged  state  of  the  levees  as  they  are 
right now. We have teams in the field, measuring, getting informa-
tion  on  those.  So,  if  Hurricane  Rita  or  other  storms  threaten  New 
Orleans  again  during  this  season,  then  we’ll  be  able  to  run  storm- 
surge  models  with  the  damaged  levee  state  in  there  to  be  able  to 
see what the vulnerability of the city will be. 

Again, this was a close-up showing what—this was the extent of 

flooding predicted simply due to the overtopping of the levees. 

And I’ll show that we also developed animations to show this, in 
a  graphical  sense.  We  can  see,  as  the  storm  moves  through,  the 
wind vectors across there—and it brings the flooding in. 

Now,  I  will  say,  where  we’re  lacking  in  the  prediction  sense  is, 
we—as  the  National  Hurricane  Center  has  shown,  we’ve  done  a 
very  good  job,  for  Katrina  and  other  storms,  in  predicting  where 
the  storm  is  going  to  go.  The  storm-surge  modeling  is  still,  as  Dr. 
Blackwell  mentioned,  maybe  on  first  or  second  base.  It’s  making 
progress.  But  predicting  the  consequences,  the  human  con-
sequences—What  is  the  wind  damage?  We’re  providing  estimates 
on  that,  based  on  the  HAZIS  model.  What  will  be  the  number  of 
buildings  flooded?  What  will  be  the  number  of  casualties,  number 
of  rescues  needed?  We  don’t  have  that  yet,  and  that’s  absolutely 
important. We’re developing those techniques. The universities and 
other  groups  are  developing  those  techniques.  But,  as  the  person 
in  Saturday  afternoon  and  Sunday  and  Monday  who  was  in  the 
State—in  Louisiana  Emergency  Operations  Center  briefing  these 
results,  I  wish  to  God  that  I  could  have  been  able  to  brief  that  we 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:25 Jun 16, 2011 Jkt 066856 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66856.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

needed 20,000 helicopter rescues, that we needed all these medical 
evacuations.  But  we—the  state  of  the  science  is  not  there  yet,  and 
we  desperately  need  to  move  ahead.  If  we  could  have  briefed  that, 
then maybe that would have helped the response get rolling a little 
bit faster. 

The  second  aspect  that  I’d  like  to  mention  is  in  regard  to  the— 
I’m  sorry—in  regard  to  what  we  need  to  do  to  prevent  these—this 
devastation,  as  Max  has  talked  many  times  before,  the  battle  is 
won off-season; it’s not won when the storm is coming in. We have 
to work to upgrade our zoning, our building codes, and our building 
construction  practices.  That  becomes  critically  important  now  in 
the  rebuilding  phase.  Now,  more  than  ever,  we  must  change  our 
practices  so  that  we  don’t  have  buildings  that’ll  be  so  totally  de-
stroyed by wind in the immediate wake of the storm. 

So, as we’re going into the rebuilding, the State of Louisiana had 
learned  a  lesson  last  year  from  Florida.  In  the  legislative  session 
that  immediately  concluded  this  past  June,  the  State  of  Louisiana 
had  passed  House  Concurrent  Resolution  Number  135,  which  cre-
ated the Uniform Building Code Task Force, which was to study— 
which  is  charged  to  study  the  situation  and  develop  recommenda-
tions  for  creating  a  uniform  building  code  across  the  state.  Iron-
ically,  the  first  meeting  of  this  committee  was  scheduled  to  have 
been held on Wednesday after landfall. I was in touch with the De-
partment  of  Insurance  as  the  lead—Louisiana  Department  of  In-
surance,  which  is  the  lead  agency,  and  they  said  they  have  sched-
uled  this—rescheduled  this  for  early  October.  So,  it’s  critically  im-
portant  that  we  make  sure  that  we  rebuild,  in  the  wake  of  this 
storm, smarter than we have before. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  MARC L.  LEVITAN,  DIRECTOR,  HURRICANE CENTER/ 
CHARLES P.  SIESS,  JR.  ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,  LOUISIANA 
STATE UNIVERSITY; PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR WIND ENGINEERING 
Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Subcommittee,  my  name  is  Marc  Levitan.  I 
am  Director  of  the  Louisiana  State  University  Hurricane  Center  and  the  Charles 
P.  Siess,  Jr.  Associate  Professor  of  Civil  and  Environmental  Engineering  at  Lou-
isiana State University. I am also the elected President of the American Association 
for Wind Engineering and a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 

I am appearing today on behalf of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Cen-
ter.  Louisiana  State  University  is  the  flagship  institution  of  the  state,  classified  by 
the  Carnegie  Foundation  as  a  Doctoral/Research-Extensive  University.  The  univer-
sity  has  a  long  history  of  research  in  hurricanes,  coastal  sciences  and  engineering. 
The  LSU  Hurricane  Center  was  founded  and  approved  by  the  Louisiana  Board  of 
Regents  in  the  year  2000  to  provide  a  focal  point  for  this  work,  with  a  mission  to 
advance the state-ofknowledge of hurricanes and their impacts on the natural, built 
and  human  environments,  to  stimulate  interdisciplinary  and  collaborative  research 
activities,  to  transfer  new  knowledge  and  technology  to  students  and  professionals 
in  concerned  disciplines,  and  to  assist  the  state,  the  Nation,  and  world  in  solving 
hurricane-related problems. Research efforts that have been translated into practice 
in support of emergency management agencies include: Implementation of real-time 
storm  surge  modeling,  improvements  in  hurricane  evacuation  planning  and  oper-
ations (particularly contraflow evacuations), and improvements in hurricane shelter 
analysis and design methods. 
LSU  Hurricane  Center’s  Role  in  Preparing  for  and  Responding  to 

Hurricane Katrina 

The LSU Hurricane Center has put its research expertise into helping prepare for 
and  respond  to  Hurricane  Katrina.  Over  the  past  few  years,  our  faculty,  staff,  and

students  have:  helped  redesign  Louisiana’s  contraflow  evacuation  plan,  one  of  the 
few bright spots in the Katrina Response; worked with many local and state govern-
ment  agencies  to  provide  hurricane  shelter  assessments  and  mitigation  plans  for 
hundreds  of  buildings;  provided  training  in  hurricane  shelter  assessment  method-
ology  and  GIS  applications  for  emergency  management,  developed  hurricane  exer-
cises  for  the  Louisiana  Office  of  Homeland  Security  and  Emergency  Preparedness 
and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, and was a part-
ner in the design of last year’s Hurricane Pam catastrophic hurricane planning exer-
cise. 

As  Hurricane  Katrina  approached,  we  were  activated  by  the  Louisiana  Office  of 
Homeland  Security  and  Emergency  Preparedness  (LOHSEP)  on  Saturday  morning 
August 27. The LSU Hurricane Center team, along with staff from the Southern Re-
gional  Climate  Center,  Earth  Scan  Lab,  and  the  Center  for  the  Study  of  Public 
Health  Impacts  of  Hurricanes  then  began  providing  24  hour  operational  support. 
This support included: 

• satellite storm tracking 
• local meteorological condition information and support 
• storm surge flood estimation 
• wind damage estimates 
Other support activities included consultations on evacuation and sheltering deci-
sions  as  the  storm  was  approaching,  flood  casualty  estimates,  and  mapping/GIS/re-
mote  sensing  support  ever  since  the  storm  made  landfall,  which  is  still  continuing. 
Maps  have  been  made  for  many  of  the  major  Federal  and  state  agencies,  including 
mapping 911 calls which helped direct rescue crews. 

One of the most important facets of this operational support was real-time storm 
surge modeling. Using the ADCIRC Model, our surge modeling team, funded by the 
Louisiana  Board  of  Regents,  provided  surge  flooding  estimates  based  on  the  Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center  forecast  predictions.  These  models  were  posted  on  a  web 
site  available  to  Louisiana  emergency  managers  and  the  results  were  included  in 
the regular briefings put on by the LSU team in the Emergency Operations Center. 
The first model run was based on Advisory 16 and was completed on Saturday after-
noon.  It  indicated  flooding  in  the  low-lying  areas  outside  the  main  levee  protection 
areas, but no overtopping in the city. The model run for Advisory 18 was completed 
very  late  Saturday  night,  and  showed  overtopping  of  the  levees  in  the  eastern  part 
of the city. 

The  ADCIRC  model  is  a  very  powerful  tool  to  examine  surge  flooding  for  single 
track scenarios right now. It is a research product that has been pressed into service 
to  assist  with  operations,  but  needs  additional  work  and  testing  to  become  a  true 
operational  tool.  LSU  researchers  are  working  right  now  to  update  the  underlying 
physical grid to account for the damaged state of the levee systems in New Orleans 
in case another storm approaches before they are repaired.

The  Critical  Role  of  Coastal  Protection,  Land  Use,  Zoning  and  Building 

Codes in Reducing Loss of Life and Property 

Hurricane Katrina has demonstrated numerous failures and shortcomings in how 
we  have  managed  both  the  natural  and  built  environments.  Coastal  land  loss, 
changes  in  land  use  and  building  construction  practices,  and  the  continued  lack  of 
adoption and enforcement of a modern, statewide building code have all contributed 
to the Katrina disaster. 

No  plan  to  rebuild  southeastern  Louisiana  can  ultimately  be  successful  without 
a comprehensive effort to protect and restore the coast. A large and healthy system 
of  wetlands  between  New  Orleans  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  has  historically  been  the 
first line of defense for the city, protecting it from the worst of the hurricane storm

surges and winds. This buffer has largely disappeared over the last 75 years. Levees 
on  the  Mississippi  River  prevent  sediments  and  nutrients  from  renewing  the  land. 
Construction of canals for the oil, gas and shipping industries has disrupted the nat-
ural  hydrology  and  allowed  saltwater  to  penetrate  the  marshes,  causing  serious 
damage.  These  and  other  factors  have  led  to  the  highest  rate  of  land  loss  in  the 
world.  Louisiana  loses  approximately  25  square  miles  of  protection  each  year  due 
to  subsidence  and  erosion.  A  comprehensive  coastal  restoration  program  must  be 
put in place and funded immediately, before the wetlands disappear entirely. 

Areas  that  have  been  protected  from  flooding  by  levee  systems  have  witnessed 
changes  in  land  use  and  building  construction  practices  that  tend  to  increase  their 
vulnerability  to  floods.  Many  areas  of  southern  Louisiana  traditionally  experienced 
flooding  often  enough  that  standard  construction  practice  was  to  either  build  on 
high ground or elevate the structures. The proliferation of flood protection levee sys-
tems  over  the  past  several  decades  has  reduced  the  frequency  of  flooding  and,  in 
some cases, lowered the mapped base flood elevation. These changes have led to the 
development  of  lower  lying  areas  and  construction  of  homes  and  businesses  using 
either  slab-on-grade  or  minimally  elevated  foundations.  These  structures  are  now 
extremely vulnerable to flooding when levee systems fail, when drainage pump sys-
tems fail, and/or when events larger than the design flood occur. 

The  lesson  here  is  clear—when  buildings  are  constructed  in  flood-prone  areas, 
whether  protected  by  levee  systems  or  not,  they  should  still  be  elevated  in  order  to 
reduce potentially catastrophic flood losses. 

Suppose  the  majority  of  homes  in  New  Orleans  had  been  constructed  with  open 
parking  or  enclosed  garages  beneath  the  homes,  meaning  that  the  elevation  of  the 
first  floor  would  be  8  to  10  feet  above  grade.  This  change  could  have  saved  many 
lives and many thousands of homes. As I have often heard Jesse St. Amant, Direc-
tor  of  Plaquemines  Parish  Emergency  Management  say,  ‘‘Elevation  is  the  salvation 
from inundation.’’ 

One of the most urgent needs in the wake of the disaster is building code reform. 
We  simply  cannot  afford  to  spend  billions  of  dollars  rebuilding  homes  and  busi-
nesses that will not stand up to the next hurricane. Studies conducted by the Insti-
tute for Business and Home Safety and several Florida universities concluded after 
last  year’s  hurricanes  that  the  new  Florida  Building  Code  was  very  effective  at  re-
ducing  hurricane  damage.  Analysis  of  thousands  of  homes  showed  that  buildings 
constructed to the new code, on average, experienced only about half as much dam-
age and loss as those built to previous codes. Additionally, a much larger percentage 
of homes built to the new code were undamaged or only minimally damaged so that 
the structures were still inhabitable. 

Louisiana learned a lesson from Florida’s hurricanes of 2004, and has begun tak-
ing steps toward building code reform. In the Regular Session ending in June 2005, 
the  Louisiana  Legislature  called  for  the  creation  of  a  Uniform  Building  Code  Task 
Force  in  House  Concurrent  Resolution  135,  with  the  purpose  being  ‘‘. . . to  study 
current laws and regulations related to the construction of buildings and structures, 
make recommendations regarding legislation that would best ensure adequate main-
tenance of buildings and structures throughout the state, and to adequately protect 
the health, safety and welfare of the people.’’ The primary motivation for this legis-
lation  was  the  reduction  of  catastrophic  damage  from  hurricanes  and  other  severe 
storms. 

The first meeting of the Uniform Building Code Task Force was originally sched-
uled  for  August  31,  two  days  after  Katrina  made  landfall.  This  meeting  was  can-
celed for obvious reasons and has tentatively been rescheduled by the Louisiana De-
partment of Insurance to October 4, 2005. It is imperative that this body make rec-
ommendations for immediate changes while the longer term solution is under delib-
eration.  One  such  possibility  would  be  to  immediately  require  all  residential  con-
struction to meet the requirements of SSTD 10–99, the Standard for Hurricane Re-
sistant Residential Construction, or a variation of that document. 
National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program 

The  recent  devastation  along  the  Gulf  Coast  of  the  United  States  brought  upon 
by  Hurricane  Katrina  pointed  out  the  vulnerability  of  the  Nation  to  severe  wind 
storms such as hurricanes. This vulnerability was recognized by Congress last year 
when it enacted Public Law 108–360, which authorized the creation of the National 
Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Program.  The  program  has  been  authorized  for  FY 
2006, but as of yet, there is no funding in the relevant appropriations bills. 

For  Fiscal  Year  2006  the  law  authorizes  $22.5  million  in  spending,  spread  over 
four agencies. I urge Congress to appropriate no less than the following funding lev-

partment of Commerce;

• $8.7 million for the National Science Foundation; and 
• $2.1 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
This  legislation  represents  five  years  of  work  in  which  stakeholders  representing 
a  broad  cross  section  of  interests,  including  research,  technology  transfer,  design 
and  construction,  financial  communities,  materials  and  systems  suppliers,  state, 
county  and  local  governments  and  the  insurance  industry,  all  participated  in 
crafting. This bill presents a consensus of all those with an interest in the issue and 
a desire to see the benefits this legislation will generate. 

The Wind Hazard Reduction Coalition represents associations and companies that 
are committed to the creation and success of the National Windstorm Impact Reduc-
tion Program. The Coalition shares the goals of the Program to significantly reduce 
loss of life and property damage in the years to come. The Coalition includes profes-
sional  societies,  research  organizations,  industry  groups  and  individual  companies 
with knowledge and experience in dealing with the impact of high winds. 

Members  of  the  Wind  Hazard  Coalition  worked  closely  with  members  and  staff 
in  the  House  and  Senate  in  crafting  the  language  contained  in  H.R.  2608,  which 
became Pub. L. 108–360. I strongly support the results and believe that, if fully car-
ried  out,  the  new  law  will  result  in  reduced  vulnerability  to  high  winds  and  lead 
to  real  and  significant  reduction  in  the  loss  of  life  and  property.  The  United  States 
currently  sustains  billions  of  dollars  per  year  in  property  and  economic  loss  due  to 
windstorms. The Federal Government’s response to such events is to initiate search 
and rescue operations, help clear the debris and provide financial assistance for re-
building.  With  this  legislation,  the  Federal  Government  can  provide  increased  re-
search  funding  to  mobilize  the  technical  expertise  already  available  to  help  reduce 
the  significant  annual  toll  on  casualties  and  property  in  the  aftermath  of  wind-
storms. 
Conclusion 

In the wake of this national catastrophe, we must take every advantage of oppor-
tunities to prevent this from happening again. Immediate steps include: moving for-
ward with plans to rebuild the coast, our first line of defense against the storm; bold 
land use and zoning changes to discourage rebuilding in the most hazardous areas; 
and  immediate  adoption  of  new  hurricane  resistant  construction  and  inspection  re-
quirements while permanent changes are under deliberation. Beyond that, Congress 
should immediately fund Public Law 108–360, which authorized the creation of the 
National  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Program  but  has  not  been  funded  to  date. 
This  program  will  provide  research  and  technology  transfer  to  improve  building 
codes and construction practices based on the lessons learned from the recent hurri-
canes. 

Once again, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the many orga-
nizations  I  am  representing  here  today.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions 
you might have. 

Senator DEMINT. Mr. Curole? 

STATEMENT OF WINDELL CUROLE, GENERAL MANAGER, 

SOUTH LAFOURCHE LEVEE DISTRICT 

Mr.  CUROLE.  Thank  you  for  allowing  me  the  opportunity  to  tes-
tify  concerning  hurricane  preparedness.  My  name  is  Windell 
Curole, General Manager of the South Lafourche Levee District. 

No  area  is  more  dependent  upon  the  National  Hurricane  Center 
and  its  predictions  than  Lafourche  Parish.  I  say  that  because  we 
have  a  roadway  that’s  only  three-quarters  of  a  foot  above  normal 
summertime high tide. That roadway leads to Grand Isle, our only 
inhabited  barrier  island  in  Louisiana,  and  also  to  Port  Fourchon, 
which  supports  deep  offshore  oil  production.  That  same  road  that 
leads to this port is the only evacuation route for 6,000 people who 
are working on offshore platforms. 

The work that the Hurricane Center performs is critical, and I’ve 
always  appreciated  their  work.  They  are  precise  in  what  they  ex-

pect  from  a  storm,  but  they  make  clear  the  accuracy  of  their  pre-
dictions and the possible variations. 

I’ve  been  indirectly  advising  evacuations  since  1982,  and,  since 
1992,  directly  advising  all  parish  presidents.  Training  at  the  Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center  was  invaluable  in  interpreting  the  Hurri-
cane Center’s projected storm tracks. The most important lesson is 
that  projected  landfall  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Some  conditions 
allow  for  more  accurate  projections,  and  some  atmospheric  condi-
tions  make  projections  very  difficult.  In  either  case,  the  Hurricane 
Center’s information is the basis for our actions. 

Our  job  on  the  local  level  is  to  educate  people  of  the  risk,  direct 
our  people  from  that  risk,  and  provide  the  avenues  to  do  so.  Our 
goal  is  to  try  to  help  people  understand  their  risk  and  to  take  ap-
propriate action. In the end, it’s an individual’s decision which con-
trols their fate. It’s the individual who makes the decision to leave 
or stay. In fact, when you order an evacuation, you’re ordering the 
retreat  of  an  untrained  army.  The  retreat  of  a  trained  army  is  a 
very difficult thing to do. We work very hard to help people under-
stand that it is an individual decision, and that if you do not make 
the right decision, you will cause your family to suffer. Correct de-
cisions minimize that suffering. 

Educating  the  individual  must  be  central  in  all  emergency  prep-
arations  on  a  local  level.  The  problem  is  to  describe  a  vision  of 
which  an  individual  has  no  experience,  and  then  have  them  move, 
time and again, even when the vision does not materialize. 

To  develop  that  vision,  I  employ  historical  data,  pictures,  along 
with  LIDAR  and  computer-generated  images,  to  illustrate  possible 
flooding  and  damage.  Anniversaries  of  major  storms  are  high-
lighted  to  remind  us  what  has  happened,  and  what  could  happen 
again. 

We  organized  a  centennial  commemorating  the  Hurricane  of 
1893,  which  killed  over  2,000  people  in  Louisiana.  And,  in  fact, 
Chairman,  in  that  same  year,  in  Tybee  Island,  near  Georgia  and 
South  Carolina,  there  was  also  a  hurricane  that  killed  over  2,000 
people  in  1893.  We  produced  an  award-winning  play  of  that  hurri-
cane,  which  played  to  sold-out  performances  that  left  some  mem-
bers of the audience shaken and emotional. Our mission was to en-
sure that people do not forget the story or lessons from that storm. 
This past year, I strongly encouraged New Orleans television sta-
tions to center their hurricane-season specials on the 40th anniver-
sary  of  Hurricane  Betsy,  the  last  powerful  hurricane  to  greatly  af-
fect southeast Louisiana. 

Yet  with  all  the  videos,  articles,  talk  shows,  and  presentations, 
some  people  will  never  believe,  or  understand,  the  extreme  threat 
that  a  Category-3,  -4,  or  -5  hurricane  poses.  That  segment  of  the 
population’s  lack  of  understanding  must  also  be  part  of  emergency 
planning.  Comprehensive  hurricane  protection  is  a  concept  which 
integrates  hurricane  protection  levees,  restoration  of  natural  sys-
tems,  hurricane  evacuation  routes,  and  improved  building  tech-
niques  for  individuals.  Resolutions  by  parishes  and  the  State  Con-
current Resolution in 1999 supports the concept of this integration 
of  infrastructure,  along  with  a  reevaluation  of  hurricane  projects, 
to provide protection for Category-4 or -5 storms.

After  Hurricane  Georges  in  1998,  it  appeared  the  State  would 
work on that concept. But they chose to concentrate only on coastal 
restoration, instead of the broader issues. 

On  the  Federal  level,  we  also  had  little  success.  Congressman 
Tauzin  was  able  to  generate  committee  reports  suggesting  FEMA 
conduct certain investigations. However, we had little support from 
FEMA, which led to no results at that time. 

We did eventually lead to positive results with the creation of the 
Southeast  Louisiana  Task  Force.  The  Southeast  Louisiana  Task 
Force was formed after Hurricane Andrew to improve the coordina-
tion of local, State, and Federal agencies. As we watched the horror 
of the people who did not have the transportation to leave the city 
of  New  Orleans  after  Hurricane  Katrina,  we  saw  total  failure.  But 
the fact is, had it not been for the continued pressure of the South-
east Louisiana Task Force, people who had the means to leave be-
fore the storm would not have been able to do so. 

Evacuation  studies  had  indicated  that  it  would  take  50  to  72 
hours  to  move  people  out  of  Metropolitan  New  Orleans.  But  hurri-
cane track errors too great beyond 48 hours, the Task Force cham-
pioned  the  reversing  of  interstate  lanes  so  that  almost  all  lanes 
were directed out of the city. The Southeast Louisiana Task Force, 
after years of trying, was successful in convincing the State into in-
stituting  contraflow.  Before  this,  some  of  those  people  who  did  get 
out  of  the  city  for  Hurricane  Katrina  would  not  have  been  able  to 
get out in time. As bad as the situation was for Hurricane Katrina, 
it would have been much, much worse had it not been for the work 
of the Southeast Louisiana Task Force. 

Levees,  highways,  and  our  natural  barriers  protect  and  support 
an  area  which  provides  critical  international  trade,  25  percent  of 
the Nation’s oil infrastructure, major shipbuilding, and the second- 
largest  fisheries  in  the  United  States.  Protection  of  these  interests 
also protects the two million people who live and work there. Main-
tenance  and  improvement  of  that  infrastructure  is  critical  for  the 
successful  planning  and  execution  of  emergency  plans  which  mini-
mize the loss of life and property. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WINDELL CUROLE, GENERAL MANAGER, 

SOUTH LAFOURCHE LEVEE DISTRICT 

Thank  you  for  allowing  me  the  opportunity  to  testify  concerning  hurricane  pre-
paredness.  My  name  is  Windell  Curole,  General  Manager  of  the  South  Lafourche 
Levee District. 

No  area  is  more  dependant  upon  the  Hurricane  Center  and  its  predictions  than 
Lafourche  Parish.  I  say  that  because  we  have  a  roadway  that  is  only  about  three- 
quarters  of  a  foot  above  normal  summer-time  high  tide.  That  roadway  leads  to 
Grand  Isle,  our  only  inhabited  barrier  island  in  Louisiana,  and  also  to  Port 
Fourchon  which  supports  deep  offshore  oil.  That  same  road  that  leads  to  this  port 
is the only evacuation route for 6,000 people who are working on offshore platforms.

accurate  projections,  and  some  atmospheric  conditions  make  projections  very  dif-
ficult. In either case, the Hurricane Center’s information is the basis of our actions. 
Our  job  on  the  local  level  is  to  educate  people  of  the  risk,  direct  our  people  from 
that risk, and provide the avenues to do so. Our goal is to try to help people under-
stand their risk and to take appropriate action. In the end it is an individual’s deci-
sion  which  controls  their  fate.  It’s  the  individual  who  makes  the  decision  to  leave 
or stay. In fact, when you order an evacuation, you’re ordering the retreat of an un-
trained army. The retreat of a trained army is a very difficult thing to do. We work 
very hard to help people understand that it is an individual decision and that if you 
do not make the right decision, you will cause you family to suffer. Correct decisions 
minimize that suffering. 

Educating  the  individual  must  be  central  in  all  emergency  preparations  on  the 
local level. The problem is to describe a vision of which an individual has no experi-
ence, and then have them move time and again, even when the vision does not ma-
terialize.  To  develop  that  vision,  I  employ  historical  data  and  pictures  along  with

Comprehensive Hurricane Protection is a concept which integrates hurricane pro-
tection  levees,  restoration  of  natural  systems,  hurricane  evacuation  routes  and  im-
proved  building  techniques  for  individuals.  Resolutions  by  parishes  and  the  State 
Senate Concurrent Resolution in 1999 support the concepts of this integration of in-
frastructure,  along  with  a  re-evaluation  of  hurricane  projects  to  provide  protection 
for Category-4 or -5 storms.

STATEMENT OF C. PATRICK ROBERTS, PRESIDENT, 
FLORIDA ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS (FAB) 

Mr.  ROBERTS.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman,  members  of  the 
Committee.  I’m  Pat  Roberts.  I’m  President  of  the  Florida  Associa-
tion  of  Broadcasters.  I’m  also  the  Florida  Chairman  of  the  FCC 
State Emergency Communication Committee. Thank you for allow-
ing me to share with you today my perspective on hurricane warn-
ings and preparedness. 

Let me begin by briefly sharing some of my experiences and rec-

ommendations. 

First, I’d like to pay tribute to Max Mayfield, who’s an old friend. 
And  the  people  in  Florida  trust  his  judgment.  I’d  also  like  to  say 
a  special  word  for  Florida’s  first-responders,  under  leadership  of 
our  Governor,  Jeb  Bush,  and  Craig  Fugate,  the  director  of  Emer-
gency Management. 

For  the  past  17  years,  I  have  served  on  the  Florida  Emergency 
Response Team. I was at the Emergency Operations Center 3 days 
before Hurricane Andrew arrived in Homestead, Florida. Later that 
day,  when  it  hit,  along  with  Governor  Chiles  we  were  in  Home-
stead to see the devastation. 

Hurricane  Andrew  taught  Florida  that  local/State  government 
need  to  be  better  prepared  to  respond  to  these  type  disasters.  An-
drew  also  taught  us  that  preparedness  was  the  responsibility  of 
both  the  public  and  the  private  sector.  As  a  result,  for  the  past  12 
years  Florida  has  invested  in  training  people,  utilizing  the  latest 
technology and public disaster-preparedness education programs. 

Those  efforts  have  not  been  limited  solely  to  hurricanes.  Florida 
has  taken  an  all-hazard  approach  to  preparedness  and  response, 
and  that  includes  hurricanes,  wildfires,  flooding,  tornadoes,  and 
also terrorist threats. 

Without the emphasis on preparedness and response that Florida 
has  had  over  the  past  12  years,  our  State  and  local  governments, 
and  our  residents,  would  not  have  gotten  through  the  four  hurri-
canes that hit our state last year. We truly play as we practice, in 
Florida. 

Let me share just a few recommendations: 
I  feel  America  must  have  a  more  comprehensive  and  cohesive 
program among Federal, State, and local governments and our citi-
zens  to  prepare  for  natural  disasters  and  terrorism.  To  accomplish 
that,  America  must  better  equip  our  cities,  our  counties,  our  State 
and  Federal  Government  to  deal  with  these  type  emergency.  That 
means more training, more exercises, and utilizing the latest train-
ing  technologies.  It  also  means  we  need  our  states  and  counties  to 
have state-of-the-art Emergency Operations Centers. The public ex-
pects a unified command, from the courthouse to the statehouse to 
the  White  House.  We  need  a  national  emergency-alert  system  for 
immediate  public  warning  that  allows  the  President,  our  Gov-
ernors, the ability to activate a county, a state, or the Nation. 

Currently, the EAS system is most often used in America for the 
AMBER  Alert  to  help  communities  find  abducted  children.  I  rec-
ommend  a  federally  funded,  State-based  EAS  system  in  a  partner-
ship  between  the  FCC  and  NOAA.  Today,  the  only  way  the  Presi-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:25 Jun 16, 2011 Jkt 066856 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66856.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

41 

dent can speak to the Nation through EAS is by utilizing National 
Weather Service. 

Most  importantly,  America  must  also  prepare  its  citizens.  I  rec-
ommend  that—an  American  preparedness  media  campaign  in  all 
50  states  on  all  hazards.  This  would  include  both  TV/radio, 
English,  Spanish,  and  any  other  appropriate  language.  If  you  use 
the  example  of  the  Army  National  Guard  model  for  an  NCSA  pro-
gram involving all 50 state broadcast associations and Puerto Rico, 
the cost for an American preparedness program like that, based on 
the  Florida  model  and  the  Army  National  Guard,  would  be  in  the 
range of $15 or $20 million. For that, you’d get back well over $100 
million of documented air time, reaching every citizen in our coun-
try. 

In  closing,  let  me  share  a  few  personal  comments.  Broadcasters 
stand  ready  to  help.  Radio,  in  the  time  of  a  disaster,  is  a  lifeline 
to  the  residents  of  the  community.  They  also  partner  with  their 
local  TV  stations  to  get  out  the  news  and  information.  In  the  fu-
ture, local TV, with multicasting, will be able to, before and during 
and after a disaster, to broadcast not only their regular news infor-
mation  over  their  regular  channel,  but  also  a  channel  on  weather, 
another  channel  on  related  information,  on  how  to  get  help,  and, 
finally, a second-language channel, such as Spanish. 

During  our  hurricanes  last  year,  one  of  many  stations  that  did 
outstanding  work  is  WESH,  in  Orlando,  Florida.  They  not  only 
broadcast,  through  the  storms,  their  regular  information,  but  they 
allowed the Telemundo station to translate it into Spanish, and ran 
it  on  their  subchannel  as  well  as  on  the  Telemundo  channel,  so 
that everyone in the Orlando area received vital information. 

Last  year,  for  the  first  time,  we  activated  EAS  before  a  hurri-
cane. That led me, this year, to share with stations in Alabama and 
Mississippi  what  they  needed  to  do  to  help  their  citizens  prior  to 
Hurricane Katrina. 

Last  year,  in  Clearwater—last  year,  Clear  Channel  Radio,  in 
Punta Gorda, lost the majority of its buildings, but it stayed on the 
air. Again this year, down in Biloxi, WLOX–TV lost a large portion 
of its facility, but it never went off the air, broadcasting to its com-
munity and helping save lives. 

Together, all first-responders are to be thanked and praised. 
I’ll  now  be  honored  to  answer  any  questions  the  Committee 

might have. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Roberts follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF C. PATRICK ROBERTS, PRESIDENT, 

FLORIDA ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS (FAB) 

Good  afternoon  Mr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  C.  Patrick 
Roberts,  President  of  the  Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters  (FAB).  I  also  serve  as 
the  Florida  Chairman  of  the  Federal  Communication  Commission  State  Emergency 
Communication Committee. 

Thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  share  with  you  today  my  perspective  on  hurricane 

warnings and preparedness. 

Let  me  begin  by  briefly  discussing  the  role  local  broadcasters’  play  when  their 

communities are threatened, and then impacted by a major storm. 

As  a  hurricane  approaches,  people  get  most  of  their  tracking  and  preparedness 
information  about  the  storm  from  television.  As  a  hurricane  makes  landfall,  and  in 
the  aftermath,  power  goes  out,  our  homes  go  dark,  and  people  are  without  tele-

42 

vision, cable, satellite, and the Internet. There is limited, if any, cell and hard-wire 
phone service. 

In  these  circumstances,  radio  becomes  the  primary,  and  in  many  cases,  the  sole 
lifeline  and  communication  tool  to  a  community  and  its  residents.  In  many  cases 
the  local  radio  stations  work  with  local  TV  news  operations  and  simulcast  the  tele-
vision  audio  signal  to  provide  a  broader  range  of  non-stop  news  and  information  to 
the impacted areas. 

In  Hurricane  Katrina,  both  large  and  small  market  television  and  radio  stations 
rose  to  meet  the  challenges  that  the  storm  presented.  The  ownership  of  these  sta-
tions  ranged  from  small,  family-owned  businesses  to  major  media  corporations. 
Going beyond normal competitive rivalries these stations worked together to ensure 
that their local communities received critical and timely news and emergency infor-
mation. 

I  visited  a  number  of  stations  in  the  impacted  areas  of  Mississippi  and  saw  the 
local news, production, engineering, and management teams of both radio and tele-
vision stations working around the clock to help their communities receive the latest 
information on the storm and its aftermath. 

The coverage was non-stop, 24-hours a day and commercial free. 
What impressed me about each of the stations I visited was the total commitment 
of  these  broadcasters  to  keep  their  stations  on  the  air  and  their  viewers  and  lis-
teners informed about their communities. 

What made that commitment even more impressive was the number of employees 
at  both  radio  and  television  stations  who  had  tragically  lost  their  own  homes;  yet, 
they  remained  at  their  posts  and  continued  to  do  their  jobs.  It  was  truly  inspiring. 
My  experience  in  Mississippi  is  not  an  isolated  one.  During  my  seventeen  years 
as  the  President  of  the  Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters,  I  have  observed  the 
same  level  of  commitment  by  Florida’s  broadcasters  each  time  a  major  storm  has 
hit our state. 

Furthermore,  I  have  seen  this  same  level  of  commitment  from  Florida’s  Emer-

gency Management community when disasters have struck my home state. 

Since Hurricane Andrew devastated areas of southern Florida in 1992, the state’s 
Emergency  Management  teams  have  developed  a  unique  and  comprehensive  ap-
proach  to  prepare  the  state,  local  governments,  and  individuals  to  better  deal  with 
the dangers of both man-made and natural disasters. 

I’m  proud  to  say  that  the  Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters  has  been  a  part  of 

the team to help with those efforts. 

Florida  has  benefited  from  the  strong  leadership  of  former  Governor  Lawton 
Chiles  and  current  Governor  Jeb  Bush  in  the  development  and  execution  of  the 
state’s philosophy in dealing with Disaster Preparedness and Response. 

Its  Emergency  Management  team,  under  the  leadership  of  Craig  Fugate,  is 

trained and prepared, and continually trains and prepares. 

Hopefully, my comments on what has been developed in Florida will provide some 
insight  to  the  Committee  as  you  explore  what  the  Federal  Government,  state  gov-
ernments,  local  governments,  and  individuals  can  do  to  better  prepare  not  only  for 
hurricanes, but for all types of natural and man-made hazards. 

‘‘Florida  Prepares’’  is  what  we  call  our  disaster  preparedness  efforts  in  the  Sun-
shine  State.  I  encourage  the  Committee  to  review  our  Preparedness  and  Response 
systems and strategies and to recommend a similar approach across all fifty states. 
I suggest it be developed under the umbrella of ‘‘America Prepares.’’ 

It is an idea whose time has come. 
The  notion  of  an  ‘‘all  hazards’’  approach  is  an  important  one  for  the  Committee 
to understand because, in the view of the Emergency Managers of Florida, the steps 
to prepare for, and respond to, are the same, regardless of the hazard. 

In Florida we do not differentiate between the different types of hazards that may 

threaten our residents and visitors. 

The  developed  approach  is  applicable  to  hurricanes,  floods,  tsunamis,  earth-
quakes,  tornadoes,  chemical  spills,  a  terrorist  attack  or  any  other  hazard  that 
threatens our communities and our citizens. 

Key  components  of  the  Florida  Preparedness  model  could  form  the  basis  for  an 
‘‘America Prepares’’ model that would better protect our citizens and their property. 

Some of the key components of the Florida model are: 

1. Annual public education media campaigns. Public radio and television media 
campaigns developed in both English and Spanish to inform citizens on the nec-
essary steps to take to prepare their families and to protect their property when 
a natural or man-made disaster threatens their community. 
2.  Robust  and  frequent  training  exercises  for  Emergency  Managers,  Government 
Officials  and  First  Responders.  These  exercises  simulate  ‘‘real-life’’  situations

followed by critical reviews of the actions taken. Critical after action reviews for 
an  actual  event  are  also  conducted  and  the  ‘‘lessons  learned’’  are  applied  to  fu-
ture responses. 
3.  An  Emergency  Alert  System  (EAS)  that  is  a  true  partnership  among  state 
governments, local governments, and broadcasters. 
4.  A  Unified  Command  approach  wherein  all  of  the  players  check  their  egos, 
logos,  and  party  affiliations  at  the  door.  The  result  is  a  true  team  approach  to 
respond to the needs of impacted citizens. 

These are by no means the only actions that have led to the success that Florida 
has  had  when  responding  to  disasters.  However,  they  are  the  ones  that  I  feel  are 
most  relevant  for  my  appearance  before  this  committee.  The  following  is  an  elabo-
ration on each of the key components. 
Annual Statewide Public Education Media Campaigns 

After Hurricane Andrew, the former Director of the Florida Division of Emergency 
Management,  Mr.  Joseph  Myers,  worked  with  me  to  develop  an  ongoing  Statewide 
Hurricane  Preparedness  Education  Program  for  Florida’s  residents  utilizing  broad-
cast  television  and  radio.  The  program  has  been  expanded  upon  and  revised  annu-
ally under the present Director, Mr. Craig Fugate. 

Hurricane  Andrew  was  a  benchmark  event  in  the  history  of  Emergency  Manage-
ment.  Federal,  state,  and  local  governments  were  ill  equipped  to  handle  this  type 
of  catastrophe  and  needed  to  rewrite  the  book  on  preparing  for,  and  responding  to, 
these types of disasters. It was also recognized that government could not do it all. 
Individuals  need  to  take  greater  responsibility  for  protecting  their  family  and  their 
property. The role of Public Education was deemed a priority by the State of Florida 
to help accomplish the ‘‘preparedness’’ goal. 

During  the  past  thirteen  years,  the  Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters  has  pro-
duced, distributed and monitored a series of television and radio spots on hurricane 
preparedness through its Non-Commercial Sustaining Announcements program. The 
spots are closed-captioned and produced in both English and Spanish. The messages 
are  decided  upon  by  the  Division  of  Emergency  Management  (DEM)  and  are  up-
dated each year based on changing priorities of the Division. 

An  example  of  those  changing  priorities  occurred  in  1999  when  Hurricane  Floyd 
threatened  our  state.  The  Division  wanted  to  address  the  problems  that  occurred 
when a massive evacuation resulted in traffic gridlock that could have put the evac-
uees  in  danger  had  the  storm  changed  its  direction.  Consequently,  FAB  produced 
a series of spots that addressed DEM’s revision of its evacuation policy. 

Past  and  present  messages  include  creating  a  family  disaster  preparedness  plan, 
special  needs  preparedness  plan,  interior  counties  preparedness  plan,  preparedness 
plans  for  pets,  and  small  business  plans.  I  have  provided  a  DVD  to  the  Committee 
and its staff that includes a sampling of the statewide television spots produced over 
the  course  of  the  partnership  between  FAB  and  the  Florida  Division  of  Emergency 
Management. * 

The partnership between the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the 
Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters  is  designed  to  be  comprehensive,  yet  nimble 
enough to respond to an immediate need. 

A case in point occurred in the beginning of July 2003. A series of drownings had 
occurred in the Florida Panhandle that was the result of rip tides. With the Fourth 
of July weekend approaching, DEM was concerned that citizens were not aware that 
they might be at-risk. 

On  the  Thursday  before  the  weekend  began,  FAB  and  its  producer,  Michael 
Babich, wrote, produced and distributed radio PSAs to its member stations through-
out the Panhandle within a six-hour period. The entire production process, including 
the initial request by DEM, script writing and approval, the recording of narration, 
post-production,  and  distribution,  was  done  electronically  through  e-mail  and  the 
PSAs began airing that Thursday evening. 

The  Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters  and  the  Florida  Division  of  Emergency 
Management  partnership  has  documented  over  $15  million  in  radio  and  television 
airtime  since  the  program  began  in  1993.  This  does  not  include  educational  cam-
paigns  independently  conducted  by  our  member  radio  and  television  stations  in 
their  local  communities.  In  fact,  almost  every  broadcast  outlet  in  Florida  develops 
their own hurricane preparedness campaign that builds upon the educational efforts 
of  the  Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters  and  the  Florida  Division  of  Emergency 
Management.

Public  Education  is  an  important  component  of  any  disaster  preparedness  effort 
and Florida’s experiences in these efforts are unequalled. I am proud of the partner-
ship  between  the  Florida  Association  of  Broadcasters  and  the  Florida  Division  of 
Emergency  Management  and  look  forward  to  continuing  our  efforts  to  educate  the 
residents of Florida on the importance of disaster preparedness. 

I urge the Committee to consider expanding our statewide public education efforts 
to  a  national  level  and  to  design  an  ‘‘America  Prepares’’  public  education  program. 
These  efforts  need  to  be  ongoing,  not  just  prior  to,  or  immediately  after,  a  major 
disaster strikes. 
Emergency Alert System (EAS): the Public Warning System 

Florida  has  the  model  Emergency  Alert  System  in  the  Nation.  The  EAS  system 
was upgraded and implemented after Hurricane Andrew. The Florida EAS has two 
primary  entry  points,  one  at  the  state  Emergency  Operations  Center  and  a  second 
at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement headquarters. 

The  state  Emergency  Communication  Committee  works  with  state  and  local  au-
thorities,  and  the  broadcasters,  to  operate  the  system.  EAS  can  be  activated  state-
wide, regionally, or by a single county. 

For years, EAS was not used prior to a hurricane. The National Hurricane Center 
and  local  media  warned  residents.  In  Hurricane  Andrew,  EAS  was  activated  to  in-
form  residents  in  south  Dade  County  the  location  for  food,  water,  and  shelter  after 
the storm. 

In 2004, EAS was activated twice in Florida before hurricanes made landfall. The 
first  was  when  Hurricane  Charley  turned  slightly  to  the  east  and  headed  towards 
Charlotte  County  in  Southwest  Florida.  Max  Mayfield  notified  Craig  Fugate  at  the 
Florida  State  Emergency  Operations  Center  how  critical  it  was  to  alert  the  south-
west  Florida  residents  that  the  eye  of  the  hurricane  was  heading  to  their  coast. 
Within  fifteen  minutes  the  State  Warning  Point  activated  the  EAS  from  Naples  to 
Sarasota,  in  both  English  and  Spanish,  informing  residents  of  the  need  to  seek  im-
mediate shelter because they were now in the path of the storm. 

The  second  time  EAS  was  activated  during  the  2004  Hurricane  Season  was  dur-
ing  Hurricane  Jeanne.  The  eye  of  the  storm  was  very  wide  and  slow  moving.  For 
years  meteorologists  have  warned  residents  the  eye  of  a  hurricane  generally  takes 
thirty minutes to an hour to pass over an area. This time, due to the size and slow-
ness  of  the  storm,  EAS  was  activated  to  inform  residents  it  would  take  several 
hours for the hurricane eye to pass their area. 

Florida’s  EAS  has  proven  to  be  a  valuable  warning  tool.  It  is  the  only  means  for 
delivering one single message at one time on all televisions, radios, and cable chan-
nels.  The  majority  of  states  and  counties  do  not  have  an  operational  EAS  system 
tied  to  their  Governor,  county  management,  or  any  state  or  local  emergency  oper-
ations center. It is time to do so. 

Taking this one step further, the United States needs an Emergency Alert System 
national program that can be activated by a mayor, county official, governor, or the 
President.  It  has  a  proven  track  record  in  Florida  for  saving  lives  and  keeping  the 
public uniformly informed. 
Training and after Action Reviews 

Every  disaster  provides  a  learning  opportunity  for  those  who  participate  in  the 
response  to  the  event.  Unfortunately,  that  is  not  the  time  to  find  the  problems  in 
an organization’s preparedness and response systems. Hurricane Andrew, 9–11, and 
now Hurricane Katrina are the best examples of disasters that overwhelmed govern-
ments and communities in the impacted areas. 

Florida,  like  many  states,  conducts  exercises  and  training  throughout  the  year. 
Florida, being in the ‘‘eye of the storm’’ more than most, probably has the most ex-
perience of any state in responding to these types of disasters. 

In  fact,  a  contingent  of  Florida  Emergency  Managers  and  First  Responders  has 
been deployed to assist the state of Mississippi in its response to Hurricane Katrina. 
After viewing those efforts firsthand, and getting reports from local government offi-
cials in the impacted areas, I can tell you that Florida’s experience has been an in-
valuable  resource  for  the  Emergency  Management  community  and  people  of  Mis-
sissippi. 

I may be biased, but I think that Florida is the most advanced state in the coun-

With  that  in  mind,  Florida  has  trained  and  learned  from  experiences  in  real-life 
events to minimize the time it takes to reach the victims of these types of disasters. 
This was continually demonstrated during the 2004 Hurricane Season. 

try when it comes to responding to a disaster. 

That being said, it is also fair to say, from a victim’s perspective, any government 

response will never be fast enough.

In  the  words  of  Florida’s  Emergency  Management  Director,  Craig  Fugate,  our 
teams  ‘‘do  not  wait  for  blue  skies’’  to  begin  the  response  to  impacted  communities, 
‘‘We move in as soon as it is safe for the first responders.’’ 

That  is  a  mindset  that  needs  to  reach  across  all  levels  of  response  from  the  Fed-
eral to state to local governments, and to charities such as the Red Cross and Salva-
tion Army. 

I  realize  that  this  is  an  easy  statement  to  make;  the  reality  of  a  situation  like 

Katrina has proven to be more problematic. 

Nonetheless,  through  an  increased  emphasis  on  training  and  after  action  review, 
other federal, state, and local emergency management teams will be better equipped 
to  deal  with  the  uncertainties  that  hazards  present  when  communities  are  im-
pacted. 

Florida undergoes extensive internal reviews of the actions taken both during ex-
ercises and real-life events. I have previously mentioned some of the lessons learned 
from Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Floyd. There are many others. 

For  example,  Hurricane  Charley’s  late  shift  towards  the  east  and  into  Charlotte 
County illustrated the need to educate the public to pay attention to the entire area 
within the ‘‘projected path cone’’ and not just the ‘‘straight-line’’ path. 

One  lesson  learned  from  Hurricane  Frances  was  that  supplies  such  as  ice  and 
water  need  to  be  positioned  in  multiple  areas  around  the  peninsula  of  Florida,  not 
just  north  or  south.  Trucks  with  supplies  positioned  north  of  the  storm  during 
Frances  could  not  make  their  way  to  the  impacted  areas  until  the  slow  moving 
storm  passed  through,  thereby  delaying  the  state’s  response.  DEM  corrected  this 
when Hurricane Jeanne came through the same area a month later. 

Actual  events  like  those  mentioned  above  can  never  be  truly  duplicated  in  train-
ing  exercises.  However,  training  tools  such  as  Table  Top  exercises,  Full  Scale  Field 
exercises and other training methods are invaluable when response teams are called 
upon to respond to actual events. 

FAB has produced a number of video and multi-media training tools for the Flor-

ida DEM and has seen firsthand the results of Florida’s training efforts. 

Through the use of training tools, Florida has demonstrated how effective training 
and  after  action  reviews  of  real-life  events  are  essential  to  develop  and  sustain  a 
first-class response team. 

These  efforts  must  be  valued  by  all  levels  of  government,  paid  attention  to,  and 

utilized when real disasters strike. 
A Unified Command Approach 

When Hurricane Charley left a trail of damage across the state of Florida in 2004, 
the  decision  was  made  by  the  Florida  Division  of  Emergency  Management  and  the 
Federal  Emergency  Management  Association  (FEMA)  to  form  a  Unified  Command. 
This meant all state and Federal assets in support of the impacted counties were 

now joined together and would be known as ‘‘Charley Command.’’ 

No longer would the supplies and materials being brought into the impacted area 

be identified as FEMA or state assets. 

As a result, the mission of the response teams became simple and clear. 
At  a  press  conference  in  Punta  Gorda,  Florida  two  days  after  landfall,  Craig 
Fugate,  the  Florida  Division  of  Emergency  Management  Director  stated  that  by 
quickly combining state and Federal assets, ‘‘our only mission in life now is to meet 
the needs of the disaster victims in the communities of this storm.’’ 

Consequently, politics and turf battles were minimized and the focus remained on 
the  victims.  The  teamwork  that  was  built  among  the  local,  state  and  Federal  re-
sponse teams was apparent in the response to each of the four storms. Building that 
team  concept,  obviously,  did  not  happen  overnight.  But  the  quality  of  the  response 
that  took  place  during  last  year’s  hurricane  season  illustrates  how  important  it  is 
to  develop  a  unified  team  that  understands  it  missions  and  maintains  it  focus  on 
the victims. 

During  the  2004  Hurricane  season,  FAB  had  camera  crews  in  the  State  Emer-
gency  Operations  Center  in  Tallahassee,  the  National  Hurricane  Center  in  Miami, 
and in the impacted areas throughout the state. The Florida Broadcasters produced 
an  hour-long  documentary  entitled  ‘‘The  Hurricanes  of  2004,’’  on  the  coordination 
between  local  and  state  emergency  managers,  FEMA,  and  the  National  Hurricane 
Center. I have provided a DVD of the documentary to the Committee and the staff. 
I  encourage  you  to  view  the  DVD  and  see  for  yourself  how  Florida  responded  to 
an  extremely  difficult  set  of  challenges.  I  am  not  implying  everything  throughout 
the  responses  to  the  four  storms  always  went  smoothly.  It  did  not.  But  the  unified 
approach worked and the citizens of Florida were served in their time of need.

Building  the  kind  of  teamwork  I  described  also  involves  building  a  level  of  trust 
that  people  will  do  their  job  and  will  not  let  bureaucracy  get  in  the  way  of  helping 
victims. 

I recently faced that type of situation as Katrina approached the Gulf Coast. 
As  I  mentioned  previously,  when  a  disaster  strikes  most  local  broadcast  stations 
provide  non-stop,  commercial  free  coverage  for  the  duration  of  the  emergency.  This 
includes  television  stations  simulcasting  over  radio  stations.  On  the  Sunday  before 
Katrina  made  landfall  I  spoke  with  broadcast  engineers  in  the  Florida  Panhandle 
and  in  the  Pensacola-Mobile  market.  They  shared  my  concern  that  Katrina  would 
likely  take  out  all  broadcast  television  and  radio  stations  in  southern  Mississippi 
and southern Louisiana. 

Based  upon  my  experience  with  Hurricane  Andrew  and  in  my  role  as  Florida’s 
Chairman  of  the  FCC  State  Emergency  Communications  Committee,  I  advised  Mo-
bile-Pensacola  stations  to  increase  power  after  the  hurricane  made  landfall  to  pro-
vide emergency information to citizens in the impacted area where broadcast service 
was inadequate. 

I  also  advised  representatives  of  a  group  of  southern  Mississippi  radio  stations 
that  if  they  were  able  to  stay  on  the  air  they  could  increase  their  power  to  provide 
emergency  information  to  areas  where  other  stations  had  been  damaged  and  gone 
off the air. 

I did not wait for formal FCC approval to take that step. 
My  experience  in  these  kinds  of  disasters  led  me  to  bypass  official  channels  and 
then to ask for ‘‘forgiveness’’ later. Fortunately, the FCC Chairman’s office and Sen-
ior Staff agreed with my advice, and encouraged me to take whatever steps I could 
devise to keep broadcasters on the air. 

I  should  note  that  the  FCC  and  its  staff  have  been  proactive  in  working  with 
broadcast stations to ensure that emergency information is available to all areas im-
pacted by Katrina. 

The reason I mention this is that in times of major disasters, people have to make 

decisions that may not always follow the proper procedures or protocols. 

The  intent  is  not  to  be  reckless  or  a  ‘‘loose  cannon’’,  but  to  do  what  is  best  for 
the citizens in the impacted communities based on an individual’s or a team’s expe-
rience. Florida has learned this lesson well and it was continually demonstrated last 
year during the four hurricanes. 
Recommendations for the Future 

Over  the  past  thirteen  years  I  have  traveled  to  every  major  disaster  that  has 
struck  the  state  of  Florida.  I  also  recently  visited  the  Gulf  Coast  of  Mississippi  to 
assist  local  broadcasters  and  view  the  damage  to  those  impacted  communities.  My 
heart  goes  out  to  the  residents  of  Mississippi  and  Louisiana.  It  is  a  disaster  unlike 
any I have ever seen. 

A  comment  was  made  that  the  damage  in  those  areas  was  of  ‘‘biblical  propor-
tions’’. It is an assessment with which I agree. Unfortunately, it will not be the last 
time a disaster of this magnitude strikes the United States. 

With that in mind, I would like to offer the Committee the following recommenda-
tions for your consideration, trusting that when future disasters strike, our govern-
ment,  our  communities,  and  our  citizens  will  be  better  prepared  to  respond  to  all 
types of disasters. 
Public Preparedness Education 

Our  Nation  must  move  forward  with  plans,  beginning  with  our  families  and  our 
neighbors, moving to the courthouse, then to the state house and ultimately, to the 
White House. ‘‘America Prepares’’ must be our focus. 

A nationwide ‘‘America Prepares’’ Campaign would encourage and help each indi-
vidual, family, special needs person, small business and others in our country to de-
velop and implement a disaster preparedness plan. 

To do so, we must launch a major nationwide public education disaster prepared-
ness campaign. The National Association of Broadcasters and, more importantly, the 
State Broadcast Associations in all fifty states and Puerto Rico who have successful 
Non-Commercial Sustaining Announcements programs are ready to help. 

Utilizing  the  network  of  State  Associations  allows  for  a  more  regional  approach 
to help citizens prepare for the different types of disasters that affect different parts 
of  our  country.  A  regional  approach  also  encourages  more  local  and  state  involve-
ment  between  broadcasters  and  the  Emergency  Management  community.  This  ap-
proach has worked in Florida and should be duplicated nationwide. 

An  ‘‘America  Prepares’’  Public  Education  Disaster  Preparedness  Campaign  would 

include:

Disaster Preparedness Plan 

• Content with specific information for people to develop and implement a Family 
• Fifteen, twenty and thirty second radio and television spots 
• Spots produced in English/Spanish/other 
• Spots closed captioned for the hearing impaired 

Improving the Emergency Alert System (EAS) 

Along  with  better  preparing  our  citizens  we  must  also  improve  and  expand  the 
current  Emergency  Alert  System  (EAS).  In  Florida,  EAS  can  be  activated  at  the 
county  and  state  level.  A  national  EAS  system  is  needed  which  can  be  activated  at 
the Federal Emergency Operations Center and at the White House. 

It is important to remember that in the impacted areas, radio and television part-
ners  are  the  lifelines  to  the  affected  areas—they  are  the  backbone  of  the  EAS  sys-
tem. 
Priority Fuel Status for Broadcasters 

When power is lost and broadcasters are on generator power, radio stations simul-
cast television programming so citizens can stay informed. To maintain that lifeline 
to  impacted  communities  I  strongly  urge  the  Committee  to  consider  recommending 
priority  status  for  fuel  allocations  to  all  radio  and  television  stations,  particularly 
the two primary EAS radio stations in the local operational areas where the disaster 
strikes. 

During Hurricane Katrina there were a number of instances where radio stations 
were  in  danger  of  going  ‘‘dark’’  because  they  were  on  generator  power  and  running 
out  of  fuel.  Local  broadcasters  play  a  vital  role  in  communicating  information  to 
residents  when  a  disaster  strikes  and  steps  need  to  be  taken  to  ensure  that  they 
remain  on  the  air  particularly  when,  as  was  seen  during  Katrina,  the  initial  re-
sponse is delayed. 

It  should  also  be  noted  that  as  we  continue  to  move  into  the  age  of  Digital  Tele-
vision,  broadcasters  will  be  able  to  expand  the  informational  services  they  provide 
to  impacted  citizens.  When  future  disasters  strike,  television  stations  will  always 
provide local news coverage, but through ‘‘multicasting’’ they will also be able to pro-
vide even more information to their viewers. 

As  an  example,  one  sub-channel  will  be  devoted  entirely  to  weather  information; 
another  sub-channel  would  broadcast  in  Spanish;  another  sub-channel  would  pro-
vide  detailed  preparedness  information.  Citizens  will  have  more  information  avail-
able  to  them  and  will  be  able  to  better  assess  their  risks  and  vulnerability.  It  is 
critical  that  broadcasters,  after  health  care  and  law  enforcement,  have  priority  sta-
tus for fuel allocations. 
Better Training Leads to Better Teamwork 

Training is another area that needs review. Florida’s systems of preparedness and 
response  are  perhaps  the  best  in  the  country  and  should  be  reviewed  by  this  com-
mittee as a model for other states. The Florida Association of Broadcasters, over the 
years,  has  produced  enough  training  materials  for  the  Florida  Division  of  Emer-
gency  Management  to  realize  the  effects  of  an  increased  emphasis  in  this  area.  I 
believe  in  the  concept  ‘‘you  play  like  you  practice’’  thus  witnessing,  firsthand,  posi-
tive results when training is a priority. 

Utilizing the latest technology and advancements in training theory can be an ef-
fective and engaging way to train Emergency Managers and First Responders to be 
better prepared to serve our citizens. 

Better training also leads to better teamwork. Some of the challenges on the Gulf 
Coast,  particularly  in  New  Orleans,  were  magnified  due  to  the  confusion  of  roles 
among the Federal, state, and local response teams. I cannot emphasize this strong-
ly enough—a response to a disaster without a unified team approach is another dis-
aster in itself. 

Florida  has  invested  a  lot  of  time,  effort  and  money  developing  partnerships 
among different state and local agencies, the Florida National Guard, charities, and 
the  National  Hurricane  Center.  The  results  of  those  efforts,  while  not  always  per-
fect,  have  led  to  a  focus  on  serving  the  citizens  of  the  state  which  is  the  ultimate 
goal of any response. 

Recognizing  the  importance  of  unified  teamwork,  I  urge  the  Committee  to  resist 
any  attempt  to  privatize  the  National  Weather  Service.  It  is  critical  to  have  quali-
fied, experienced, independent meteorologists. The chance cannot be taken for profit 
to replace product or for personal appearance to replace experience. 

The  National  Hurricane  Center  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Florida  team;  to  take 
any steps altering this relationship is, in my opinion, a serious mistake and not wor-
thy of serious consideration.

Conclusion 

48 

My comments are designed to improve our national efforts in responding to disas-
ters  of  all  kinds,  and  it  is  my  desire  this  committee  will  consider  my  thoughts  and 
recommendations in the spirit in which they are offered. 

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  come  before  this  committee  today.  Our  world  is 
changing dramatically and unfortunately, disasters have become somewhat of a way 
of life for the citizens of the United States. Therefore, Americans must be better pre-
pared to handle the challenges when disasters strike. 

I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  work  they  are  doing,  I  offer  my  help  to  prepare 
the  citizens  of  the  United  States  for  any  future  disasters,  and  now,  I  am  honored 
to answer any questions the Committee may have at this time. 

FLORIDA’S EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM (EAS) 

I. Introduction 

When  the  Emergency  Broadcast  System  (EBS)  was  first  introduced  in  the  1960s 
its scope was limited: warn the population of the threat of nuclear attack. Through 
the years, the EBS became a conduit of passing on life-saving weather information, 
but  the  technology  became  antiquated.  Because  digital  technology  was  becoming

more  reliable,  the  FCC  changed  the  EBS  into  the  Emergency  Alert  System  (EAS). 
The  EAS  would  mirror  the  EBS,  but  provide  a  more  dependable,  bottom-up  ap-
proach  in  providing  emergency  messages.  National  activations,  the  only  time  gov-
ernment  can  override  programming,  remains  the  same.  However,  state  and  local 
emergency  management  officials  and  broadcasters  may  decide  what  messages 
should  be  aired  to  the  public.  The  EAS  brings  in  technology  that  was  uncommon 
in  the  60s—satellite  communications,  cable  television,  paging  systems,  and  cellular 
telephones.  It  is  envisioned  the  public  will  quickly  grow  accustomed  to  hearing  the 
shortened  emergency  message,  and  then  tune  to  their  regular  news  source  for  the 
protective action information. 

Each  year  Florida  is  impacted  by  many  devastating  emergency  and  disaster 
events requiring the immediate alerting of citizens and visitors providing them with 
an  opportunity  to  protect  themselves  and,  time  permitting,  their  property.  The 
Emergency Alert System is an invaluable tool that will help prevent the loss of Flor-
ida’s most precious resources—its people. 
II. Purpose 

The  purpose  of  the  Florida  EAS  Plan  is  to  put  in  place  a  system  for  emergency 
officials  to  use  to  announce  or  transmit  an  emergency  alert  to  the  potentially  im-
pacted population. 
III. Authorities and References 

Title  47  U.S.C.  151,  154(i)  and  (o),  303(r),  524(g)  and  606;  and  47  CFR,  Part  11, 
Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations, Emergency Alert Sys-
tem  (EAS)  as  it  pertains  to  day-to-day  emergency  operations.  Note:  47  CFR,  Part 
11, was amended May 16, 2002. Portions of this state plan have been updated to in-
corporate the changes. 

All  operations  of  the  Emergency  Alert  System  are  in  accordance  with  Subpart  G 
of  Part  73,  FCC  Regulations  (Title  47,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations;  The  Federal 
Communications  Commission’s  ‘‘EAS  Checklist’’ ).  This  plan  is  consistent  with  the 
provisions  of  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Federal  Communications  Commission 
(FCC)  and  is  considered  to  be  a  supplement  to  the  National  Emergency  Alert  Sys-
tem Plan. 

NUREG  0654,  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency,  establishes  emergency 

notification requirements for Nuclear Power Plants. 
IV. Plan Implementation and Maintenance 

The  Florida  Emergency  Alert  System  Operational  Plan  is  prepared  by  the  State 
Emergency  Communications  Committee  in  conjunction  with  the  Florida  Division  of 
Emergency  Management  and  is  based  on  recommendations  from  state  and  county 
emergency  management  officials,  National  Weather  Service  (NWS),  and  the  broad-
cast industry. The responsibility of administering this Plan rests with the members 
of the Florida State Emergency Communications Committee (SECC). 

This  plan  supersedes  the  previous  plans  for  the  State  of  Florida  Emergency 

Broadcast System effective June 1, 2002. 

This Plan should be reviewed at least annually, after each activation of the EAS, 
or  as  otherwise  needed.  The  Plan  may  be  amended  or  modified  by  a  majority  vote 
of the State Emergency Communications Committee. 

Acceptance  of  or  participation  in  the  Plan  shall  not  be  deemed  as  a  relinquish-
ment  of  program  control  or  to  prohibit  a  broadcast  licensee  from  exercising  inde-
pendent discretion and responsibility in an emergency situation. Broadcast stations 
and  cable  systems  originating  EAS  emergency  communications  shall  be  deemed  to 
have conferred rebroadcast authority. The concept of management of each broadcast 
station and cable system to exercise discretion regarding the broadcast of emergency 
information and instructions to the public is provided by the FCC Rules and Regula-
tions. 
V. Concept of Operations 
A. Planning Assumptions and Situation 

1.  Coordination  of  the  Emergency  Alert  System  is  the  joint  responsibility  of  the 
State  Emergency  Communications  Committee,  Operational  Area  Committees,  Na-
tional Weather Service, and Florida’s Emergency Management community. 

2.  This  Plan  shall  be  used  as  a  guide  for  the  activation  of  the  Emergency  Alert 

System; the specific event situation may require modification of the system. 

3.  The  success  of  the  EAS  depends  solely  upon  the  cooperation  among  the  broad-
cast  industry,  cable  television  industry,  National  Weather  Service,  and  emergency 
management  officials  to  receive,  broadcast,  and  re-broadcast  emergency  messages.

9. The State Emergency Communications Committee recognizes that broadcasters 

rely on ‘‘air time’’ use to maintain business continuity. 
B. Operational Objectives 

The  EAS  program  is  formulated  around  two  distinct  time  frames:  Preparedness 
and  Response.  Preparedness  being  activities  that  should  be  implemented  prior  to 
the  initiation  of  the  EAS.  The  Response  phase  is  the  real  time  activation  of  EAS. 
The following Operational Objectives must be accomplished to comply with the FCC 
EAS regulations and to put in place an EAS program to successfully alert Florida’s 
citizens and visitors. 
Preparedness Objectives 

Objective 1: Broadcasters, and State and Local Emergency Managers must become 

familiar with the Emergency Alert System. 

Objective  2:  Local  Primary  1  and  2  Station  Broadcasters,  and  State  and  Local 
Emergency  Managers  must  conduct  or  participate  in  the  Required  Weekly  Test 
(RWT) of the Emergency Alert System as established by the Operational Area Com-
mittee Plan. 

Objective  3:  Local  Primary  1  and  2  Station  Broadcasters,  and  State  and  Local 
Emergency Managers must conduct or participate in Required Monthly Test (RMT) 
of  the  Emergency  Alert  System  as  established  by  the  Division  of  Emergency  Man-
agement. 

Objective  4:  Operational  Area  Committee  shall  coordinate  activities  of  the  Emer-
gency  Alert  System  with  broadcasters,  National  Weather  Service,  and  local  and 
state emergency management agencies. 

Objective  5:  Local  Primary  1  and  2  Station  Broadcasters  participate  in  exercises 

with local and state emergency management agencies. 

Objective  6:  Local  Primary  1  and  2  Station  Broadcasters,  Operational  Area  Com-
mittees, and Local and State Emergency Managers must orient the public in the use 
of the Emergency Alert System. 
Response Objectives 

Objective  1:  National  Weather  Service  or  Local  or  State  Emergency  Management 
shall  activate  the  system  as  quickly  as  possible  upon  becoming  aware  of  an  emer-
gency/disaster event. 

Objective  2:  Local  Primary  1(LP  1)  stations  and  Local  Primary  2  (LP  2)  stations 

must continuously monitor a minimum of two EAS sources. 

Objective  3:  Broadcasters,  and  State  and  Local  Emergency  Managers  should  par-
ticipate  in  and  support  the  use  of  the  Emergency  Alert  System  during  real  events. 
Objective  4:  Broadcasters,  and  State  and  Local  Emergency  Managers  should  cri-

tique the use of the Emergency Alert System after real events. 

Objective  5:  State  Emergency  Communications  Committee  and  Operation  Area 
Committees  shall  modify  State  and  Operational  Area  EAS  Plans  based  on  the  re-
sults of real-time EAS activations. 
C. EAS Priorities 

The  following  are  EAS  priorities  as  set  forth  in  the  FCC  Rules  and  Regulations: 
A  national  activation  of  the  EAS  for  a  Presidential  message  with  the  Event  code 
EAN as specified in § 11.31 must take priority over any other message and preempt 
it if it is in progress. 

1. EAS participants should transmit other EAS messages in the following order: 
(1)  Local  Area  Messages;  (2)  State  Messages;  (3)  National  Information  Center 
(NIC) Messages. 
2. Key EAS sources (NP, LP, SP and SR) and Participating National (PN) that 
remain  on  the  air  during  a  National  emergency  must  carry  Presidential  Mes-
sages ‘‘live’’ at the time of transmission or immediately upon receipt. Activation 
of  the  National  level  EAS  must  preempt  State  and  Local  Area  EAS  operation. 
3. During a national emergency, the radio and television broadcast network pro-
gram distribution facilities must be reserved exclusively for distribution of Pres-

51 

idential  Messages.  NIC  messages  received  from  national  networks  that  are  not 
broadcast  at  the  time  of  original  transmission  must  be  recorded  locally  by  LP 
sources for transmission at the earliest opportunity consistent with the message 
priorities in paragraph (1) of this section. 

D. Assignment of Responsibilities 
1. The State of Florida Emergency Communications Committee 

The  FCC  appoints  the  SECC  Chair  and  Vice  Chair.  SECC  members  include  the 
Chairs and Vice Chairs of the operational area emergency communications commit-
tees  and  other  voluntary  members  appointed  by  the  SECC  Chair.  The  State  Emer-
gency Communications Committee is responsible for: 

a. Overseeing the functionality Florida Emergency Alert System. 
b. Reviewing operational area plans. 
c. Promoting the EAS with Florida Broadcasters. 

2. Local Area Emergency Communications Committees 

The State of Florida is divided into 12 major EAS Operational Areas based on the 
broadcast  industry’s  Audience  of  Dominant  Influence  (ADI).  The  ADIs  are  recog-
nized by the Federal Communications Commission. The operational area committee 
and  vice-chair  are  appointed  by  the  FCC.  Committee  members  are  appointed  on  a 
voluntary  basis  by  the  Operational  Area  committee  chair.  The  Operational  Area 
Committees serve as sub-committees of the State Emergency Communications Com-
mittee. 

However, geographic or demographic influences have created ‘‘sub’’ areas that are 
recognized by the Operational Area and State Emergency Communications Commit-
tees.  The  Palm  Beach  Area  is  subdivided  into  10–A  and  10–B  where  ‘‘10–A’’  serves 
the  northern  2/3  area  that  includes  St.  Lucie,  Indian  River  and  Okeechobee  coun-
ties.  ‘‘10–B’’  serves  the  southern1/3  area  that  includes  Palm  Beach,  Martin  and  St. 
Lucie counties. The Miami-Dade Area is subdivided into 11–A and 11–B where ‘‘11– 
A’’  serves  the  English  speaking  population  and  ‘‘11–B’’  serves  the  Hispanic  popu-
lation.  The  Key  West  Area  is  divided  into  12–A  (Upper  Keys)  and  12–B  (Lower 
Keys). 

The Operational Area Committees are responsible for: 

a. Overseeing the Operational Area Emergency Alert System. 
b. Developing and maintaining operational area plans. 
c. Promoting the EAS with local Emergency Management Programs and Broad-
casters. 
d. Participating with the State Emergency Communications Committee. 
e. Orientating the public to the EAS program. 

3. Division of Emergency Management 

The Florida Division of Emergency Management is the State Primary (SP) station 
broadcasting emergency alert messages and is a source of EAS State messages. The 
SP  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  National  Weather  Service  Warning  and  Fore-
cast  Offices  (WFO)  and  county  emergency  management  programs  for  emergency 
messages.  The  SP  may  assist  with  either  a  single  or  multiple  county  EAS  message 
activation.  Additionally,  SP  messages  may  originate  from  the  Governor  or  a  des-
ignated  representative  in  the  State  Emergency  Operating  Center  (EOC).  Messages 
are  sent  via  the  State  Relay  Network.  The  Division  has  developed  and  installed  a 
statewide  satellite  system  (ESATCOM)  which  will  serve  as  the  basis  of  the  EAS 
communication network. An ESATCOM antennae is (or will be) placed at each LP1 
and  LP2  station,  each  NWS  WFO,  county  EM  and  State  EM  locations.  The 
ESATCOM  is  a  secure  system  that  requires  no  authentication  code.  If  the 
ESATCOM is unavailable, contact will be made via commercial telephone lines and 
the  authentication  process  must  be  implemented.  As  the  State  Primary  (SP)  for 
Florida, the Division of Emergency Management responsibilities are to: 

a. Assist the State Communications Committee with EAS program activities. 
b. Conduct the required monthly testing of the EAS. 
c. Maintain operational capability to provide immediate response to emergency/ 
disaster events. 
d.  Maintain  the  ESATCOM  system  for  immediate  broadcast  of  EAS  messages. 
e. Immediately activate the EAS upon becoming aware of an emergency/disaster 
event.

52 

f. Orient the public to the EAS program. 

4. Local Primary Station 1 

Local Primary 1(LP1) radio station (AM or FM) is the source of EAS Operational 
Area messages. An LP1 source is responsible for coordinating the broadcast of emer-
gency  messages  from  sources  such  as  the  NWS  or  local  emergency  management  of-
fices  or  SP  as  specified  in  its  EAS  Operational  Area  Plan.  If  the  LP1  is  unable  to 
carry  out  this  function,  other  sources  in  the  Operational  Area  may  be  assigned  the 
responsibility  as  indicated  in  State  and  Local  Area  Plans.  The  Local  Primary  Sta-
tion 1 responsibilities are to: 

a.  Continuously  monitor  a  minimum  of  two  sources  (SP  and  local  emergency 
management) of emergency information. 
b. Maintain an operational readiness state. 
c.  Participate  with  the  Operational  Area  Committee  to  maintain  and  enhance 
the EAS Plan. 
d. Conduct the Required Weekly and Monthly tests as outlined in CFR 47 Part 
11. 
e. Orient the public to the EAS program. 

5. Local Primary Station 2 

Local Primary 2 (LP) is the Operational Area’s second source of the EAS message 
with  the  responsibility  for  monitoring  the  LP1  station  and  immediately  rebroad-
casting  the  emergency  messages.  Just  as  the  LP1,  LP2  stations  monitor  the  Na-
tional  Weather  Service,  local  emergency  management  programs  and,  when  avail-
able, the State Primary station. The Local Primary Station 2 responsibilities are to: 
a.  Continuously  monitor  the  LP  1  and,  at  least,  one  additional  source  of  emer-
gency information. 
b. Maintain an operational readiness state. 
c.  Participate  with  the  Operational  Area  Committee  to  maintain  and  enhance 
the EAS Plan. 
d.  Conduct  the  Required  Weekly  and  Month  tests  as  outlined  in  CFR  47  Part 
11. 
e. Orient the public to the EAS program. 

6. Local Emergency Management 

It  is  the  inherent  responsibility  of  a  local  emergency  management  program  to 
alert  citizens  to  hazardous  or  disaster  events.  The  EAS  is  the  primary  mechanism 
for immediate notification. 

The Local Emergency Management Program responsibilities are to: 

a. Assist the Operational Area Committee with EAS program activities. 
b. Maintain operational capability to provide immediate response to emergency/ 
disaster events. 
c.  Upon  becoming  aware  of  an  emergency/disaster  event,  immediately  activate 
the EAS. 
d. Maintain an operational communications link with the Operational Area LP1 
and LP2 and SP stations. 
e. Orient the public to the EAS program. 

7. National Weather Service 

The National Weather Service is responsible for continuously monitoring and ana-
lyzing weather systems and issuing severe weather warnings and watches. The Na-
tional  Weather  Service  coordinates  with  state  and  local  emergency  management  of-
fices to ensure a smooth flow of information during operational events. 

The National Weather Service responsibilities are to: 

a. Assist the Operational Area Committee with EAS program activities. 
b. Maintain operational capability to provide immediate response to emergency/ 
disaster events. 
c. Maintain an operational communications link with the Operational Area LP1 
and LP2 and SP stations. 
d. Disseminate all warnings and weather emergency messages through the link 
for EAS activation. 
e. Orient the public to the EAS program.

8. State Relay Network 

The State Relay Network is composed of State Relay sources, leased common car-
riers communications facilities or any other available communications facilities. The 
Network  distributes  the  State  EAS  message  originated  by  the  Governor  or  des-
ignated official, and serve as the Presidential Entry Point. 
9. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 

The  FCC  is  the  Federal  Agency  responsible  for  the  oversight  and  coordination  of 
all  radio,  television,  and  cable  television  broadcast  within  the  Untied  States.  This 
includes  the  assessment  and  maintenance  of  rules  and  regulations  governing  the 
Emergency  Alert  System.  The  FCC,  also,  provides  support  (technical  assistance)  to 
the State Emergency Communications Committee and operational area committees. 
E. Emergency Alert System Process 

The  EAS  is  activated  to  warn  a  potentially  impacted  populace  of  an  impending 
or  occurring  emergency/disaster  event  regardless  of  type  (weather  or  other  natural 
hazard, technological hazard, or terrorism). One or more of three agencies may acti-
vate EAS, as seen in Figure 1. Conceptually, the following flow chart and steps de-
pict the EAS process. 

mediate alerting of people in the potentially impacted area. 

2.  An  EAS  activation  is  initiated  by  the  County  Emergency  Management  Coordi-
nator  (or  National  Weather  Service  or  State  Division  of  Emergency  Management). 
DEM may be required in some cases to assist a particular county in their activation 
of the EAS process. 

In the event of emergencies or disasters (hazardous materials, terrorist event, tor-
nadoes,  etc.)  local  emergency  managers  have  the  authority  and  must  immediately 
advise the population of the dangerous situation by communicating directly with the 
Local Primary 1 (LP1) station(s). 

When a significant weather system covers a large portion of the state, more than 
one  NWS  Forecast  Office  may  be  required  to  activate  EAS.  This  situation  neces-
sitates  close  coordination  among  all  affected  NWS  Offices  from  the  perspective  of 
forecast  continuity  and  EAS  activation.  Once  determined  that  severe  weather  will 
impact  the  State,  the  NWS  issues  appropriate  watches  or  warnings.  However,  it  is 
important to note that the NWS is limited to the broadcast of only Civil Emergency 
EAS  messages  via  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA) 
Weather Radio System. 

1. An emergency or disaster event occurs or is impending, which requires the im-

In  the  instance  that  an  emergency  or  disaster  event  (technological  or  terrorism) 
impacts  Florida  on  a  regional  or  statewide  basis,  the  State  Division  of  Emergency 
Management (DEM) must activate EAS to warn citizens. 

3. The EAS message is transmitted to the Local Primary 1 Station by local emer-

gency management (or NWS or SP) for immediate broadcast.

4. The EAS message is received by the LP 1 and is recorded or developed (by com-

pleting pre-scripted formats) prior to broadcast. 

5.  Recorded  messages  are  re-broadcast  within  seconds.  The  manually  received 
EAS  message  must  be  recorded  then  re-broadcast  or  announced  directly  to  the 
broadcast  audience.  Staffed  stations  have  the  option  of  first  receiving  the  message, 
and activating EAS at the next break (depending of the severity of the event). 

6. Relay Stations receive and re-broadcast the EAS message. 
7. The general public receives the EAS message. 
8. The public reacts by tuning-in for additional information, as promised. 
9. Follow-up emergency public information is broadcast. 
10. The public takes protective action during the emergency/disaster event. 

F. Summary 

In summary, the success of the State EAS is contingent upon: 
• The  ability  of  all  EAS  partners  (radio,  television,  and  cable  broadcasters,  Flor-
ida’s Emergency Management community, and National Weather Service) to un-
derstand and carry-out their responsibilities; 

• The  State  Division  of  Emergency  Management  ESATCOM  system  to  function 

• The SECC to aggressively coordinate EAS activities; 
• The Area Emergency Committee orienting the public and participating in exer-

optimally; 

cises; 

• The public to understand and heed emergency alerting and instructions.

Senator DEMINT. Thank you. 
I will yield to Senator Vitter for an opening statement. 

STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID VITTER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA 

Senator  VITTER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I’m  sorry  I  was 
running late. It was because of other Katrina work. But, thank you 
for holding this hearing. Thanks to all of the folks testifying before 
the Committee. 

Now,  Mr.  Chairman,  at  your  June  26th  hearing  on  hurricane 
prediction,  I  gave  an  opening  statement  describing  a  worst-case 
scenario,  the  hypothetical  situation  of  a  major  hurricane  making  a 
direct  hit  on  St.  Bernard  and  Plaquemines  Parishes  in  the  city  of 
New Orleans. We used posters showing the National Weather Serv-
ice’s  prediction  of  innundation  in  these  areas.  Computer  models 
showed  up  to  18  feet  of  water  in  parts  of  the  city  of  New  Orleans. 
At  that  hearing,  I  expressed  my  frustrations  with  every  level  of 
government’s policy of basically being reactive to disasters, instead 
of proactive. And my exact quote was, ‘‘We can spend millions now 
preparing for a disaster, or we can spend billions, later, responding 
to a disaster.’’ Finally, I said, ‘‘It’s not if we are hit by a hurricane, 
but when the disaster occurs.’’

Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  now  know  the  ‘‘when.’’  August  29,  2 
months,  to  the  day,  following  that  hearing.  And,  unfortunately,  all 
of those predictions and SLOSH models turned out to be true. 

What’s most frustrating is, this did not have to happen. It didn’t 
have to be this way. Unlike September 11 or the tsunami, to some 
extent,  there  was  really  no  element  of  surprise  here.  This  wasn’t 
just  predictable,  it  was  predicted,  many  times  over,  in  part,  by 
these fine folks before us. 

There  has  been  an  extraordinary  amount  of  finger-pointing  and 
partisanship  since  Katrina.  In  all  of  this  political  posturing,  some 
very  bright  lights  have  been  ignored,  and  we  have  some  before  us 
today. 

I  want  to  thank  Director  Max  Mayfield  and  his  team  at  the  Na-
tional  Hurricane  Center.  Because  of  their  great  work,  we  knew 
pretty much exactly where Katrina was going to make landfall, 56 
hours  before  the  storm  came  ashore.  And  that  is  astounding,  and 
that’s  great  progress  over  the  last  several  decades.  That’s  enough 
time  to  drive  from  New  Orleans  to  New  York  twice,  with  a  good 
night’s sleep both times. 

And,  Director  Mayfield,  as  you  know,  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
Louisianans did load up their families and evacuate. So, thank you 
for giving them the information that let them do that. 

Another  bright  light  here  today  is  Marc  Levitan,  of  LSU  Hurri-
cane  Center.  Marc’s  team  provided  data  predicting  that  the  levees 
on Lake Pontchartrain would be topped, a full 36 hours in advance 
of  the  storm.  New  Orleans  is  a  bowl.  And,  of  course,  topped  levee 
means widespread flooding. 

Another witness here today, Windell Curole, has been expressing 
his concerns about our situation in preparedness for years. Windell 
brought this to our attention and helped Congress design the ongo-
ing  hurricane  protection  evaluation  currently  underway  by  the 
Corps of Engineers. 

But,  again,  what’s  most  frustrating  is,  it  really  didn’t  have  to 
happen  this  way.  I  hope  we  understand  that,  and  remember  that, 
as  we  move  from  immediate  relief  to  recovery.  And  I  also  hope  we 
fully understand why we need to mount this reconstruction and re-
covery.  It’s  not  a  matter  of  simply  doing  good  by  the  citizens  of 
Louisiana;  it’s  a  matter  of  doing  the  smart  thing  for  the  entire 
country, both in the reconstruction effort and in making sure we’re 
better prepared in the future. 

Again, we can’t afford not to rebuild, and this is the smart thing 
to  do  for  the  country.  And  it’s  not  just  a  matter  for  Louisiana  or 
Mississippi  or  Alabama.  The  ports  between  Baton  Rouge  and  New 
Orleans comprise the largest port system in the world. We provide 
36 states with maritime commerce. Midwestern farmers depend on 
our  ports  and  waterways  to  get  well  over  70  percent  of  their  crops 
to market. Oil and gas, Louisiana and our associated infrastructure 
provides 20 percent of our Nation’s energy. That has provided $140 
billion  to  the  U.S.  Treasury  in  the  form  of  energy  royalties.  And 
our  State  of  Louisiana  also  has  16  percent  of  the  Nation’s  refining 
capacity.  Louisiana  provides  up  to  30  percent  of  the  domestic  sea-
food consumed in this country, and much of the ecosystem and fish-
ing fleet was destroyed.

So,  I  know  we  will  rebuild,  as  a  national  need  as  well  as  a  pri-

ority for my State. 

I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for all of your leadership, and I look 
forward  to  a  good  continuation  of  our  hearing  from  2  months  ago. 
Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Senator Vitter. And I know the en-
tire  Senate,  as  well  as  the  whole  country,  joins  me  in  just  telling 
you  how  sorry  we  are  what  happened  to  your  State  and  your 
friends and family. And we will support you in the recovery effort. 
As we sit here, Hurricane Rita is now at Category-2 status, and, 
the last I saw on some of the predictions, headed toward Texas. So, 
we’ve got another storm to test out our models, unfortunately. 
Chairman Stevens, would you like to begin our questioning? 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I  really  would.  And  I  thank  you  very  much,  be-

cause I do have to move on. 

I  join  all  of  you  in  thanking  Director  Mayfield  and  all  of  those 

who have supported us on this effort. 

You  know,  I’ve  got  to  be  a  little  provincial,  myself.  One  of  the 
reasons that I decided we should have a subcommittee dealing with 
disaster  prediction  and  prevention  was  that,  the  first  typhoon  in 
the  Arctic,  that  we  know  of—in  2003—it  touched—almost  touched 
Point Barrow. 

You’re fortunate, where you all live, because you have the really 
intensive  prediction.  We  don’t  have  it  up  where  are,  on  the  north-
west Arctic coast. 

But  I  do  want  to  ask,  and  particularly  with  regard  to  this—Mr. 
Mayfield,  we’ve  been  reading,  all  of  us,  about  the  connection  be-
tween  this  increased  hurricane  activity  and  global  warming—are 
you  ready  to  comment  about  that  at  all?  My  scientists  in  Alaska 
tell me that the connection is not really made yet. Do you have an 
opinion? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I  do,  Senator.  And  there  are—you  know,  this  is 
certainly a hot topic. And I—you know, I’ve been in meteorology for 
35  years  now,  and  I—from  my  perspective  here,  we  have  cycles. 
And, in regard to hurricanes, there are cycles of active periods and 
then  inactive  periods.  And,  for  example,  the  1940s,  1950s,  and 
1960s were very, very active, lots of hurricanes, lots of major hurri-
canes;  and  then  the  1970s,  1980s  and  early  1990s,  the  numbers 
really dropped down. And then in 1995, it’s just like somebody had 
threw  a  switch  here,  and  we’ve  had  a  lot  more  hurricanes—not  a 
record  number  of  major  hurricanes,  but  close.  We’ve  had  a  lot  of 
activity  again.  And  the  research  meteorologists  tell  us  that  we’re 
in  for  another  10  or  20  years,  or  more,  of  this  active  period  here. 
Without invoking global warming, I think that the—just the nat-
ural variability alone is what this can be attributed to. And I think 
the  important  thing  here  is  that,  even  without  invoking  global 
warming,  we  need  to  make  sure  that  we  get  our  country  prepared 
for  what  we  think  will  be  another  10  or  20  years  of  active  hurri-
cane activity. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Roberts, Senator Inouye and I have been working very close-
ly  with  Senator  DeMint  and  Senator  Nelson,  getting  ready  to  put 
in  a  bill  that  deals  with  a  new  National  Alert  System.  We  hope 
that  we’ll  get  bipartisan  support,  and  active  support,  from  the

57 

whole Congress on that. I want to thank you for what you’ve done, 
and the broadcasters. 

Let  me  ask  this.  The  Weather  Bureau  has  a  radio  that  is  quite 
useful  to  pilots.  I  wonder  if  we  ought  not  to  see  if  we  couldn’t  get 
that  kind  of  a  radio  back  into  the  average  family’s  hands.  I  come 
from  the  generation  when  we  only  had  radio.  And  we  had  a  Na-
tional  Alert  System.  And  we  had  it  tested  about  every  2  weeks,  as 
I  recall.  Now  everybody  has  cell  phones  or  computers,  that  they’re 
using  for  communication.  We  don’t  have  a  uniform  mechanism  to 
contact  our  people.  And  what  do  you  think  about  that,  should  we 
find  some  way  to  go  back  to  a  uniform—it’s  one  thing  to  have  a 
uniform  alert  system,  it’s  another  thing  to  make  sure  that  people 
have  the  facilities  to  get  that.  This  alert  system  we’re  working  on, 
we’ll  try  to  fold  in  all  the  means  of  communication.  But  what  are 
you and the broadcasters saying about that? 

Mr.  ROBERTS.  Well,  as—Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  know,  broadcast 
stations  have  been  somewhat  frustrated.  Every  TV  and  radio  sta-
tion  in  this  country  has  EAS  equipment.  Now,  in  Florida,  after 
Hurricane  Andrew,  we  funded  a  statewide  EAS  system.  Our  Gov-
ernor has two entry points. We have two primary stations in every 
operational area. Every county has operational equipment. 

Unfortunately,  the  country  doesn’t  have  that.  Now,  fortunately, 
after  9/11,  Reynold  Hoover  worked  with  NOAA  and  uses  the  Na-
tional Weather Service, like the NOAA radios, but he’s now able— 
the  National  Weather  Service  is  the  only  Federal  agency  that  can 
activate every single EAS monitor at every radio station, every TV 
station,  and  every  cable  outlet.  So—and  I  think  it  would  be  great 
if we add the cellular world, Internet—I mean, it’s a world—it’s the 
world where we’re going. 

But  I  would  agree  with  you,  on  radio.  After  the  disaster,  9/11, 
cell  phones  didn’t  work  within  about  an  hour,  because  they  all  got 
jammed. After a hurricane, radio is the only thing left. And I think 
we’ve got to keep it as the basic ingredient. I mean, satellite dishes 
move. If you—somebody said, ‘‘Well, you could use the satellite tel-
evision.’’ I said, ‘‘Well, you know, in a hurricane, dishes move, and, 
once it moves a little bit, you get nothing else.’’ 

So,  I  think  what  the  whole  country  needs—I  mean,  every  Gov-
ernor  should  be  able  to  warn  his  people.  And  the  President  should 
be  able  to  warn  his  people,  whether  it’s  a  county,  because  it’s  a 
wildfire  or  a  chemical  spill,  or  the  Nation,  if  it’s  a  terrorist  attack. 
And,  unfortunately,  right  now  the  country  has  a  very  inadequate 
system. Basically, it doesn’t have a system. I think four Governors 
can activate. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  I  don’t  know  who  to  ask  this  of,  but,  you  know, 
I  live  in  earthquake  country,  and  we  have  a  building  code  for 
earthquakes,  and  our  building  code  says  that  you  can’t  get  insur-
ance unless you have compliance with it for the earthquake protec-
tion.  Are  we  near  the  point  now  where  we  ought  to  start  talking 
about  some  different  types  of  building  codes  and  other  things  to 
prevent the damage we’ve seen from this hurricane, or is that pos-
sible? 

Dr. Levitan, are you involved in that? 
Dr. LEVITAN. Yes, very involved. We’ve made significant improve-
ments. The building codes which are out there right now, if they’re

58 

adopted and enforced, would prevent quite a bit of the damage. The 
study  done  by  Institute  for  Business  and  Home  Safety,  following 
last year’s hurricanes in Florida, of thousands of homes shows that 
after  Florida  adopted,  2  years  ago,  the  statewide  mandatory  build-
ing  code,  buildings  built  to  that  code  suffered  only  about  half  as 
much  damage  as  the  other  buildings,  and  many  buildings  were 
undamaged. 

We certainly also need to work to improve the building codes, as 
well.  And  one  opportunity  to  do  that—last  year,  the  Congress  au-
thorized  the  creation  of  a  National  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction 
Program,  but  it  has  not  been  appropriated.  Unfortunately,  Public 
Law  108–360  was  authorized  for  $22.5  million  to  help  do  exactly 
just that, to bring the technologies, to improve the codes where we 
have, but that has not been appropriated, so I urge Congress to im-
mediately  authorize  the  appropriate  funds  for  that.  It  will  help  to 
improve the codes. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you.  I  promise  you  we’ll  look  into  that.  I 

just happen to be in that committee. 

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. We’ll look at that. 
Last, let me ask you this. We’re really dealing with disaster pre-
diction—and  you  all  are  involved  with  that—and  prevention.  Is 
there  any  means  of  deterring  these  forces?  Have  we  looked  into 
that?  I  mean,  I  remember  cloud-seeding  and  all  the  rest  of  the 
things  we  went  through  in  the  1950s  and  1960s.  Is  anyone  still 
looking at that? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  The  Government  is  not  looking  at  that,  Mr. 
Chairman.  We  did  have  the  Project  Storm  Fury  going  on  there  for 
a  couple  of  decades,  and  the  idea  was  to  seed  the  outside  of  the 
eyewall  with  silver  iodide,  with  the  idea  of  expanding  the  eyewall, 
like the ice-skater—if you expand your arms, you’ll slow down. But 
then, along came Hurricane Allen, in 1980, and it went from a Cat-
egory-5 to Category-3, -5, -3, -5, -3—three different times, all on its 
own.  And  if  nature  can  do  that  on  its  own,  it’s  very,  very  difficult 
to  even  detect  what  man  has  done.  So,  as  far  as  I  know,  there  are 
no  formal  government  programs  on  this.  I  have  heard  of  a  few  in 
the  research  community  that  are  thinking  about  it,  but  I’m  not 
going to hold my breath. 

The CHAIRMAN. I’m not going to get into this business about fin-
ger-pointing,  as  the  Senator  has  mentioned.  But,  in  1997–98  we 
mandated the creation of a disaster plan for New Orleans. And, at 
that  time,  I  was  informed  that  level  3  would  be  the  level  that  we 
should  talk  about,  because  everyone  knew  if  it  reached  level  4  or 
5, the levees in New Orleans would fail. Are we capable of making 
such  a  judgment  in  areas  where  storms  are  prevalent,  as  to  what 
facilities  will  fail?  Could  we  get  a  study  of  what  facilities  will  fail 
and  try  to  see  if  we  can  buttress  them  up  in  the  event  we  had  a 
similar earthquake—I mean, a similar hurricane again? 

Mr.  CUROLE.  Yes,  definitely  there’s  enough  science—there  is 
enough  science  out  there  that  we  can  build  structures  that  can  do 
the  job  for  us.  But,  just  like  any  structure,  they’re  designed  for  a 
certain level of protection. We saw the failure along the flood walls. 
It’s very important that we find out exactly what worked and didn’t 
work, as far as structural flood protection. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:25 Jun 16, 2011 Jkt 066856 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\66856.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

59 

But  I  want  to  remind  everybody,  our  goal  when  we  build  these 
structural protections, it’s to buy us time to get out. Our philosophy 
in  building  these  things  is  that  they  protect  property.  We  would 
prefer  getting  people  out.  And  that  is  going  to  be  continuing.  Be-
cause  you  can’t—no  one  can  tell  for  sure  whether  a  barge  will  get 
loose—a  large  boat  will  get  loose  and  run  into  a  structure  and 
cause failure. So, our goal is to build to that level of protection, get 
our  people  out.  And  in  all—in  most  instances,  we  come  out  OK. 
These systems do work. 

But, as you mentioned, a Category-3 exercise we had with Hurri-
cane  Pam,  we  just  flooded  the  city  with  ten  feet  of  water,  and  we 
expected  this  type  of  problem  that  took  place.  Having  a  Category- 
4  hurricane,  you’re  bound  to  run  into  these  problems.  But  St.  Ber-
nard  Parish,  which  had  a  good,  well-maintained  system,  was  over-
topped early in the ball game, and it’s a Category-3 hurricane sys-
tem.  Plaquemines  Parish  levee  system,  well-maintained,  well-de-
signed, still was overtopped because the—it wasn’t designed for the 
height of water that Hurricane Katrina put in that area. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  thank  you  all,  again.  Thank  you,  Mr. 

Chairman, Senator Nelson. 

We’ve had a lot of bad news coming out of this area, the disaster 
area,  but  I  think  we  wanted  to  have  this  hearing,  because  is  the 
good news. We had a system for prediction. It was fulfilled. 

Mr. Mayfield—Director Mayfield, you and your people did a mar-
velous  job.  I  think  those  people  that  did  get  away  from  that  storm 
really  owe  your  lives—their  lives  to  you  and  your—the  people  you 
work  with.  We’ve  got  to  find  a  way  to  deal  with  those  who  can’t 
get  out,  that’s  one  lesson  we’ve  learned  from  this.  But,  as  far  as 
the ability to predict and to give the message, I think we now have 
a sufficient time warning on these storms. And I think you’ve done 
just one tremendous good job. So, I thank you all. 

And thank you for this hearing. 
Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  apologize  for  losing  my  voice  today.  I’m  going  to  turn  to  Rank-
ing Member Nelson. I know he’s got to get out of here in a few min-
utes. 

Senator BEN NELSON. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
And again, Mr. Mayfield, this is something short of a coronation 
for you today, but your—you and your colleagues certainly deserve 
all the credit that you’re receiving today because of the importance 
of this forecasting capability, that you showed can, and does, work. 
What I’d like to do is, I’d like to explore a little bit more in detail 
the  communications  between  the  National  Hurricane  Center  and 
Federal, State, and local officials, not so much to point fingers, but 
to  get  an  understanding  of  the  timeline  of  the  alerts  that  were 
issued. I think, obviously, we recognize that early warning can help 
for  early  prevention  for  property  loss  and  certainly  the  loss  of  life. 
I notice that several conference calls involving the Hurricane Li-
aison  Team  occurred.  Can  you  tell  me  a  little  bit  more  about  how 
those  calls  were  structured,  who  was  involved,  what  kind  of  infor-
mation was covered in these calls? I think they’re critical. 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I’ll  be  very  glad  to,  Senator.  And  I’ll—and  I  ap-

preciate the kind word for the staff, too.

You  know,  I’ve  been  in  meteorology  for  35  years,  and  I’ve  basi-
cally  spent  most  of  my  adult  career  trying  to  prevent  large  loss  of 
life  from  a  hurricane  like  Katrina.  And  no  one  wants  to  find  out 
more than I do if there is anything that we could have done to have 
done an even better job. 

There’s  a  tremendous  amount  of  coordination  that  goes  on,  and 
there’s  a  tremendous  team  effort  involved.  And  before  I  get  to  the 
Hurricane Liaison Team, the first level of coordination occurs right 
before  every  forecast  goes  out.  We  make  that  5-day  forecast  every 
6 hours. We’ll update that if there’s something that’s in the forecast 
that occurs. And, right before that forecast goes out, we have a hur-
ricane  hotline  call  with  all  of  our  local  National  Weather  Service 
offices.  We’ll  explain  the  forecast,  the  reasoning  behind  that  fore-
cast.  If  anyone  has  any  questions,  they  can  speak  up  right  then. 
So, right before the forecast goes out, the National Weather Service 
is very, very well coordinated. 

Then we turn around and start typing up the advisory as quickly 
as  we  can.  As  soon  as  that  forecast  goes  out,  the  local  forecast  of-
fices turn around and start coordinating with their local—the coun-
ty and parish emergency managers, on the local level. And I know 
these  folks  in  the  Slidell/New  Orleans  office,  and  in  the  Mobile, 
Alabama, office, and I know they did their job there. 

In  addition  to  that—that’s  on  the  local  level,  now—the  Federal 
and  State  levels,  FEMA  has  a  conference  call.  In  fact,  they  have 
invited us to be a participant in—it’s a—usually a video-teleconfer-
ence.  In  Katrina,  it  was  held  at  noontime,  Eastern  time.  And  it’s 
not  only  FEMA  headquarters,  but  they’ll  have  the  regional  FEMA 
offices;  Region  4,  in  Atlanta,  Georgia;  Region  6,  in  Denton,  Texas; 
and,  very  importantly,  the  State  Emergency  Operations  Centers. 
So,  for  example,  they  would  have  Texas,  Louisiana,  Mississippi, 
Alabama,  Florida,  and  Georgia  State  EOCs  on  that  video-tele-
conference.  The  National  Hurricane  Center  is  an  invited  partici-
pant  in  that,  and  I  would  typically  come  in  and  give  a  very  short 
5-minute  weather  briefing  on  Katrina,  ask  for  questions,  and  then 
my  part  fades  out  and  the  emergency  managers  do  their  emer-
gency-management  talk,  you  know,  where  Texas  needed  to  know 
what Louisiana was doing, and Alabama needed to know what Mis-
sissippi was doing. So, that typically occurred. 

But the formal video-teleconferences, including the Hurricane Li-
aison  Team  and  the  National  Hurricane  Center,  occurred  once  a 
day, but we’re continually updating the forecast on a—generally, on 
a 6-hour cycle. 

I hope that answered some of that. 
Senator  BEN NELSON.  Well,  I  think  it  does.  Is—for  example,  the 
weather  advisory  on  Sunday,  August  28,  2005,  at  10  a.m.,  that 
Chairman  DeMint  read,  would  that  be  the  kind  of  advisory  that 
would be available to—and do you know if it was made available— 
to FEMA? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  My  understanding  of—that  particular  product 
that  came  out  of  the  Slidell  Weather  Forecast  Office  was  given  to 
their—the  folks  in  their  area  of  responsibility.  Primarily,  the—you 
know,  they  have  responsibility  for  southeastern  Louisiana  and 
southern Mississippi. So, everybody within their area—I mean, the 
hurricane  local  statement  was  available  to  everyone.  I  mean,

61 

they—anybody  could  see  that.  But  it  was  really  intended  for  the 
people to—in their area of responsibility to create that sense of ur-
gency. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Would  it  be—if  the  information  is  most 
beneficial when it’s localized, because the—when it’s generalized, it 
probably isn’t that helpful. Is that accurate? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  That’s  correct.  And  I—the  National  Hurricane 
Center,  you  know,  we  take  the  big  picture,  you  know,  out  for  the 
whole 5-day period. And I don’t expect my staff to know, you know, 
every  little—in  fact,  they  probably  don’t  even  know  all  the  par-
ishes, and couldn’t pronounce them if they did know them, in Lou-
isiana. But that’s why it’s such a team effort from the national cen-
ters  and  the  National  Weather  Service  and  those  local  forecast  of-
fices. Real team effort. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  But  there  isn’t  any  reason  to  believe  that 
the  emergency  people  wouldn’t  have  been  aware  of  this  particular 
advisory.  They  should  have  been—people  should  have  been  aware 
of  this  advisory,  if  you’re  paying  attention  to  what’s  happening  lo-
cally. 

Mr. MAYFIELD. Senator, I think that the players in the hurricane 
program—you  know,  anytime  we  even  have  the  mention  of  a  Cat-
egory-3  or  a  major  hurricane  on  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  headed  any-
where  near  southeastern  Louisiana,  they’re  aware  that  they  have 
a—they could have a real problem there. 

Senator BEN NELSON. One final question. 
Mr. CUROLE. I’d just add one more comment to that. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Oh, yes. 
Mr. CUROLE. We were very aware how dangerous the storm was. 
We  often  talk,  with  conference  calls  and  individually,  to  the  Na-
tional  Weather  Service  in  Slidell.  And  that  was  no  surprise.  And 
the impact of this storm does not surprise any of the managers. We 
realized  the  threat  that  was  out  there,  and  the  risks,  from  that 
powerful storm. 

Senator BEN NELSON. The statement, ‘‘It was unprecedented,’’ is 
not  the  same  as  saying,  ‘‘It’s  unanticipated  or  unexpected,’’  is  that 
correct? 

Mr. MAYFIELD. That is correct. 
Senator  BEN NELSON.  One  final  thing.  My  colleague  with  the 
same name raised some questions about taking you off the air. And 
I’ve  heard  that  these  AccuWeather  forecasts  are  very  often  pro-
vided as part of tracking briefings. Do you know whether Secretary 
Chertoff  or  Homeland  Security  or  FEMA  receives  hurricane  track-
ing briefings based on AccuWeather forecasts? 

Mr. MAYFIELD. Senator, I’ve heard that they do look at those, at 
times.  The  official  Government  forecast  on  hurricanes  comes  from 
the  National  Hurricane  Center.  All  of  our  forecasts  are  out  there 
for  anyone  to  look  at.  We  actually  now  have  a  verification  page  on 
our  website.  Anybody  can  go  in  there  and  look  at  the  verification 
on  every  individual  storm,  going  back  for  decades.  And  I’ll  let  our 
verification speak for itself. 

Senator  BEN NELSON.  Well,  the  fact  that  your  information  is 
available  right  now  to  people  who  can  access  it  through  the  Inter-
net and other sources, I assume you think that’s valuable informa-

tion for people, because self-help is almost always the best measure 
of getting help. 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  And  I  still  remember,  actually,  last  year,  coming 
to  the  office  and  asking  how  many  hits  we  were  getting  on  our 
website. This was, I believe, during Hurricane Ivan. And somebody 
said,  ‘‘Seven  thousand.’’  And  I  said,  ‘‘That’s  all?’’  And  they  said, 
‘‘Per second.’’ 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. MAYFIELD. I think that speaks for itself, too. 
Senator BEN NELSON. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. To my col-
league  to  my  right  here,  I’ve  teed  it  up.  It’s  up  to  you  to  hit  it  out 
of the park now. Thank you very much. 

Thanks  to  all  of  our  witnesses  today.  We  appreciate  very  much 
your commitment, your support, and, obviously, your continuing in-
terest.  With  a  partnership  like  this,  I  think  we  have  some  oppor-
tunity  to  improve  where  we  are  by  taking  it  to  a  new  level  where 
we need to go. 

Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Senator. 
And since you’ve teed it up, I’ll yield to the other Senator Nelson. 
Senator BILL NELSON. Thank you. 
And  I  want  to  continue  on  the  coronation  here.  First  of  all,  I 
just—as  a  testimony  to  you,  as  I  was  flying  back  to  Washington 
from  my  departing  airport,  I  went  to  a  computer  that  was  avail-
able,  went  on  the  National  Weather  Service  so  that  I  could  see 
what the latest track was. It was about 2 hours old. And it’s direct 
information  that  is  just  very  good,  because,  at  a  point—at  that 
point, I had to decide, Was I coming to Washington or was I flying 
back to South Florida? And thank you for that information. 

Now,  speaking  of  that,  I  haven’t  seen  the  track  since  early  this 

morning. What’s the latest? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Well,  the—we  put  out  a  special  advisory  at  2 
p.m.,  updating  it  to  a  Category-2  hurricane,  100  mile-per-hour 
winds.  The  center  was  passing  just  about  50  miles  south  of  Key 
West, and that’s better than having it, you know, closer. Hopefully, 
the  eyewall  itself  stayed  a  little  bit  south  of  there,  although  I 
don’t—I’m  dying  to  see  a  radar  loop,  myself,  here.  US–1  went 
under water, up in the northern part of the Keys, as forecast. And 
they—at  least  the  last  time  here,  the  last  advisory,  you  still  had 
it as a Category-2 hurricane. Hopefully, it’ll be in the Gulf of Mex-
ico  before  it  strengthens.  But  we’ve  still  got  a  big  problem  ahead 
of us here over the next 4 days as it gets into the open Gulf of Mex-
ico. And it is forecast to become a major hurricane. 

Senator BILL NELSON. Unbelievably, I’ve heard some rumors that 
they’re trying to cut funding to the National Weather Service. And, 
for  example,  some  of  those  old  P–3s  that  fly  right  into  the  storm 
are getting pretty old, and they need a replacement. What can you 
tell us about that? 

Mr. MAYFIELD. Well, the aircraft reconnaissance, there’s no doubt 
that those folks just do a tremendous job for us. NOAA has two P– 
3s. And our one-and-only Gulfstream IV jet aircraft, that jet doesn’t 
fly through the core of the hurricane routinely, but in the environ-
ment  around  the  hurricane,  to  sample  the  steering  currents.  And 
we  flew  them  repeatedly,  back-to-back  missions,  on  Katrina.

They’ve been flying Rita. They are—we’re going to give them a day 
off here, and then we’re going to start back-to-back missions again 
tomorrow afternoon, as it heads toward Texas. 

The  Air  Force  Reserves  also  have  ten  C–130’s,  and,  in  fact,  I 
want to thank the Congress for the help on those Air Force planes. 
We’re  getting  ten  new  J  models.  In  fact,  they  may  all  be  already 
at—I  mean,  they’re  becoming  operational,  as  we  speak,  this  hurri-
cane  season.  So,  that’s  a  good-news  story  there.  On  the  Air  Force 
side,  we  need  to  get  some  instruments  that  have  been  developed 
from  the  NOAA  P–3s  onto  those  Air  Force  planes.  And  the  hurri-
cane  supplemental  bill  last  year  provided  money  for  that.  And  so, 
we’re heading the right direction there. 

I think one—if I can say this—gap that’s been identified is, we— 
I think—maybe I could say it like this—if you were to ask someone 
at the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center what’s one of their great-
est  fears,  I  suspect  they’d  probably  say,  ‘‘A  bird  in  one  of  the  en-
gines on that jet.’’ With one jet, we’re a little vulnerable there. And 
I think when the impact studies are done, the Hurricane Resource 
Division  will  do  these  impact  studies  with  and  without  that  jet 
data, and I’m pretty confident that that jet data will be responsible 
for some of these, you know, good forecasts that we’ve made so far 
on the landfalling hurricanes. 

Senator BILL NELSON. In an attempt to try to downsize, and con-

solidating offices, what’s that going to do to you? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Senator,  I’m  a  big,  big  supporter  of  the  local 
Weather  Service  Forecast  Offices.  That’s  one  of  the  reasons  this 
works.  And  the  fact  that  the  local  Weather  Forecast  Office,  like  in 
Slidell,  can  talk  to  the  emergency-management  community  that— 
in  the  area  they’re  responsible  for,  that’s  what—that’s  been  one  of 
the biggest advances, I think, in the National Weather Service dur-
ing my career. I would hate to see that cut. 

Senator BILL NELSON. Me, too. 
Mr. Roberts, you are a user of the information from the National 
Weather  Service,  and  you  provide  a  great  service  to  the  public  as 
the  means  by  which  it  gets  out.  What  is  your  opinion  about 
privatizing the National Weather Service parts of it in the informa-
tion provided? 

Mr.  ROBERTS.  Well,  I’ve—for  the  last  17  years,  I’ve  gotten  to 
know  Max—and  his  predecessors,  but  he  has  been  there,  too—at 
the  Hurricane  Center.  And  we  know  most  of  the  companies  you’ve 
talked  about  who  might  be  interested  in  privatizing,  because  most 
of their clients are either corporations or broadcast outlets who hire 
them. 

First of all, I think it would be a sad day that one private-sector 
company  who  competes  for  one  of  the  stations  in  a  market  to  end 
up  being  the,  ‘‘official’’  government  weather  system.  I  mean,  that 
would  be  a  disadvantage,  No.  1,  to  their  competitors  in  a  competi-
tive environment. 

Second, once you move it out from under a person like Max, and 
it  becomes  a  profit-driven  situation,  I’m  not  so  sure  the  product 
doesn’t  suffer,  at  profit.  And  I’m  not  sure—with  all  due  respect, 
Max,  when  you  get  ready  to  retire,  any  of  the  stations  in  Florida 
will  be  glad  to  hire  him—but  I’m  not  sure,  sometimes,  some  of 
these  systems  aren’t  like  some  of  the  anchors  on  the  weather,  and

the  meteorologists—appearance  may  have  more  to  do  with  it  than 
substance. I think it would be a sad day. 

I’ve  worked  with  Max.  I’ve  been  at  our  Studio  C  now  for  17 
years. I know our people trust the Hurricane Center. I know every 
station  carries  that  information.  And  I  think  it’s  good  having  one 
neutral, credible, respected source of information when you’re deal-
ing about disasters the size of Andrew or the size of Katrina. 

Senator  BILL NELSON.  Mr.  Roberts,  after  a  disaster,  we  have 
seen  the  FCC,  Federal  Communications  Commission,  allow  broad-
casters  to  increase  their  power  in  order  to  get  out  the  word  of  a 
disaster.  Does  this  need  to  be  handled,  in  your  opinion,  favorably 
by  FCC  action,  or  do  you  think  Congress  should  take  some  action 
in this? 

Mr.  ROBERTS.  I  actually  had  a  chance  to  meet  with  Chairman 
Martin’s  staff  yesterday.  I  think  they’re  looking  at  coming  up  with 
a  rule  that  clarifies  to  everybody,  so  there  is  no  cloud,  that  when 
something  like  this—a  hurricane,  we,  kind  of,  know  is  coming;  we 
may not know how severe. Last year, in Hurricane Charley, every-
body  was  paying  the  dotted  line  attention,  thought  it  was  going  to 
Tampa.  Max  kept  saying,  ‘‘It’s  going  somewhere  between  Naples 
and  Pasco  County.’’  All  of  a  sudden,  it  turned  and  went  into  Port 
Charlotte, as we all know. 

I  think  the  FCC  is  going  to  look  at  an  advance  rule—and  if  an 
earthquake  hits,  we  don’t  have  the  advance  notice—that  if  your 
area  is  impacted,  and  you’re  still  on  the  air,  you  can  increase 
power, as long as you go to emergency mode. If you’re in an adjoin-
ing  market  and  the  stations,  like  over  in  Biloxi,  that,  for  a  while 
radio  was  out  over  there—I  think  two  stations  survived,  and  the 
next day we got it up to six—I think they’re going to say, ‘‘If you’re 
in  Mobile  or  Pensacola,  and  you’ll  go  to  all  news  and  information, 
no  ads,  increase  your  power  or  whatever  you  need  to  do  to  reach 
those  people.’’  And  I  think,  instead  of  going  after-the-fact  and  ask-
ing  for  that,  the  FCC’s  getting  ready  to  make  that  a  permanent 
rule, that every broadcaster knows they have the authority and the 
ability to do that. 

Senator  BILL NELSON.  Mr.  Roberts,  we  had  an  example  of  that 
in one of the four hurricanes in Florida. It was headed for an area 
of southeast Polk County, which technically was in the Tampa Bay 
market, but the stations in Tampa knew that they had escaped the 
brunt.  You  could  increase  the  power  in  the  stations—in  this  case, 
the Orlando stations—that were broadcasting into that area to give 
them  the  additional  warnings  about,  ‘‘It’s  headed  right  this  way.’’ 
Mr. ROBERTS. It worked very well in Florida last year. And we’ve 
been  working  on  it  for  a  long  time.  And  our  local  FCC  offices  in 
Florida are a true team. They’re kind of like, with us, like the Hur-
ricane  Center  is  with  Craig  Fugate,  we  talk  before  storms,  during 
them. 

And the other thing, broadcasters in Florida are considered first- 
responders.  We’re  at  the  county  EOCs,  we’re  the  State  EOCs.  We 
realize  our  role  is  to  get  the  information  out  to  the  public.  And, 
after  the  storm,  radio  becomes  the  lifeline.  Now,  the  TV  station 
news  facilities  may  be  giving  them  the  information,  but,  without 
that continuity—and sometimes what bothers me—we were all sit-
ting  away—and,  Senator,  when  your  state  got  hit,  we  thought

about  you  over  there—people  forget  the  people  in  the  impacted 
area  aren’t  seeing  the  network  newscast,  they’re  not  seeing  FOX 
News  and  CNN,  they’re  listening  to  their  local  radio  station.  If 
they’ve  got  a  battery-run  television,  that’s  a  true  lifeline,  and  I 
hope, when these things happen—I know our Governor remembers. 
That’s  who  he  wants  to  talk  to  first.  He  doesn’t  care  about  doing 
The  Morning  Show,  in  New  York.  He  wants  to  make  sure  the  per-
son  that  got  hurt  knows  he’s  coming  and  getting  people  there.  I 
think sometimes we get our priorities messed up. 

Senator  BILL NELSON.  Final  question.  Mr.  Mayfield,  35  years  as 
a  meteorologist,  do  you  think  that  there’s  a  long-term  trend  of  the 
sea levels rising? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Well,  I  think  that’s  documented,  that  it’s  slowly 

rising. My problem is relating that to a hurricane and—— 

Senator BILL NELSON. I understand. And the temperature rising? 
Mr.  MAYFIELD.  There’s  a  natural  variability  that  goes  on  there 
in  the  ocean,  just  like  with  hurricanes.  In  fact,  the—if  you  look  at 
a plot of the increase in temperatures in the main development re-
gion in the Atlantic, you’ll see decades above normal, a few decades 
below  normal,  and  we’re  back  in  a  period  with  above-normal  tem-
peratures.  And  the  hurricane  activity  follows  that.  I  have  a—my— 
personally,  I  have  a  problem  with  relating  the  increase  in  hurri-
canes  to  global  warming,  because  there’s  not  an  increase  globally 
in  the  number  of  tropical  cyclones.  In  fact,  some  ocean  basins,  the 
number is—like the eastern North Pacific, where the National Hur-
ricane Center also forecasts for, the numbers have gone way down. 
Senator  BILL NELSON.  So,  over  a  period  of  50  years,  you’re  not 
concerned about the global temperature rising, causing frequency— 
greater frequency and ferocity of storms. 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I  don’t  think  that—the  studies  I’m  familiar  with 
really don’t say that we’re going to have more hurricanes. There is 
a  study  out  there  that  suggests  there  will  be  a  5  percent  increase 
in intensity by the year 2080 if there’s a doubling of carbon dioxide. 
So, there is a small—very, very small chance that the intensity will 
increase.  Right  now,  we  couldn’t  even  measure  this  with  the  tools 
that we have now. 

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Senator. 
I want to quickly—go to Senator Vitter, but just one quick ques-
tion for you, Mr. Mayfield. Is it true that you called, personally, the 
Governors  of  Louisiana  and  Mississippi  and  Alabama  prior  to  this 
storm hitting? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  Yes,  sir.  I  called.  I  don’t  do  that  very  often,  but 
I—in  fact,  I’ve  only  done  it  one  other  time,  Hurricane  Lilly,  in 
the—when  it  was  a  Category-4  hurricane  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  I 
called the former Governor of Louisiana in 2002. And this was Sat-
urday  night,  around  8:30  or  9  o’clock,  Eastern  time,  and  I  called 
the—I  got  hold  of  the  Governor  of  Louisiana,  the  Governor  of  Mis-
sissippi.  And  Governor  Blanco,  in  Louisiana,  suggested  that  I  call 
Mayor Nagin, in New Orleans. I called him, left a message, and he 
called me right back. 

And  I  have—a  lot  of  people  in  the  media  have  asked  me  exactly 
what  I  said,  and  I—you  know,  with  the  hundreds  of  briefings  that 
we  did,  I  don’t  remember  exactly,  but  the  whole  purpose  of  that 
was just to be absolutely sure that they understood, you know, the

severity of the situation there. And I do remember telling all three 
of  them  that,  you  know,  I  wanted  to  leave  the  National  Hurricane 
Center  that  night  and  be  able  to  go  home  and  sleep  knowing  that 
I had done everything that I could do. 

Senator DEMINT. Well, thank you. 
And I know they’re calling a vote, but if we can give this another 

5 to 7 minutes, Senator Vitter can ask his questions. 

Senator VITTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  wanted  to  follow  up  on  that  question.  And  you  touched  on  it 
a little bit, but if you could expand more, How unusual or unprece-
dented  is  that  sort  of  call  to  the  Governors  and  mayors  of  affected 
areas? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  For  me,  it’s—I  had  never  done  that,  other  than 
that one telephone call in Hurricane Lilly in 2002. I just, you know, 
had  the  feeling  that,  you  know,  at  times  politicians,  I  think,  can 
be a little isolated, and I just wanted to make absolutely sure that 
they understood how serious this was. 

Senator  VITTER.  And,  in  this  Katrina  timeline  and  scenario,  the 
things  that  fall  into  that  category  of  being  pretty  unusual  and  ex-
traordinary  were  a  phone  call  to  the  Governor  of  Mississippi,  Gov-
ernor  of  Louisiana,  a  representative  of  State  government,  as  I  un-
derstand  it,  in  Alabama,  and  the  mayor  of  New  Orleans.  Is  that 
correct? 

Mr. MAYFIELD. That’s correct. 
Senator  VITTER.  OK.  And  were  any  other  communications  ex-

traordinary like that? 

Mr. MAYFIELD. No, the others were just the routine coordination 
calls, for the most part. I mean, people can call in at any time and 
we’ll, you know, obviously, talk to them, but those were a little spe-
cial  there.  And  they  all  seemed  to  appreciate  the  call,  at  the  time. 
And the—people ask me when we really became concerned about 
the—you  know,  the  flooding  in  New  Orleans.  And  the—you  know, 
the  answer  to  that  is  just:  decades  ago.  This  wasn’t  just—you 
know,  it  didn’t  just  happen  with  Katrina;  we’ve  been  concerned 
about  that.  And  every  previous  director  of  the  National  Hurricane 
Center  before  me,  they  have  all  been  united  in  saying  that  the 
greatest  potential,  you  know,  for  the  nightmare  scenario  and  the 
large loss of life, is in that southeastern Louisiana area. 

Senator  VITTER.  In  the  call,  specifically  to  the  Governor  of  Lou-
isiana  and  the  Mayor  of  New  Orleans,  did  you  specifically  talk 
about mandatory evacuation orders? 

Mr. MAYFIELD. A lot of people have asked me that, Senator, and 
I  wish  I  remembered  exactly  what  I  said.  I—with  all  the—you 
know,  we  literally  gave  over  400  briefings  and,  you  know,  the 
weather—the  situation  is  constantly  changing,  and  I  think—I  just 
don’t  remember  if  I  talked  about  evacuation  or  not.  I—you  know, 
my mission is to provide the best forecast that we can, and I simply 
don’t remember. If I did, I would gladly tell you. 

Senator  VITTER.  And  do  you  remember  any  other  specifics  that 

you may have touched on, like storm surge, et cetera? 

Mr. MAYFIELD. I don’t remember, for certain. But in all the brief-
ings  that  were  given—this  is  a  Saturday  night,  now,  and  it  was, 
you  know,  already  a  Category-3  hurricane,  and,  you  know,  on  its 
way  to  a  Category-4—I  hope  I  would  have  said  something  to  the

effect  that,  you  know,  ‘‘This  is  a  very,  very  serious  situation  with 
the  potential  for  a  large  loss  of  life  if,’’  you  know,  ‘‘we  don’t  make 
the proper preparations.’’ 

Senator VITTER. In this very good timeline that accompanies your 
testimony—I  didn’t  see  it  here,  although  it  could  be  here—do  you 
remember  exactly  where  the  President’s  first  emergency  declara-
tion  fits  in,  which  was  made,  I  believe,  when  the  storm  was  off-
shore? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I  don’t  remember  exactly  when  the  declaration— 
but  by—I  remember  hearing  the  media  report.  That  was  before 
the—you know, definitely well before landfall. 

Senator  VITTER.  And  was  that  preceded  by  any  sort  of  unusual 
or extraordinary communication, or was that simply the product of 
these normal advisories and conference calls? 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  I  think  that’s  pretty  standard  for  major  hurri-

canes. I remember that happening in previous storms, too. 

Senator  VITTER.  OK.  I  know  Dr.  Blackwell,  in  his  written  testi-
mony,  has  talked  about  updating  the  hurricane-intensity  grading 
level  to  account  for  more  factors  besides  simply  wind,  like  size, 
storm  surge,  et  cetera.  I’d  like  to  hear,  from  all  of  the  scientific- 
based experts, their reaction to that idea. 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  That  has  been  kicked  around  for  a  number  of 
years now. And Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale was never intended 
to  be  a  stand-alone  product.  The  Saffir–Simpson  scale  is  based 
upon  the  maximum  sustained  wind.  It’s  a  1-minute  average  wind 
at a standard elevation of 10 meters or 33 feet. 

We’ve talked about a precipitation index, and one of the—for ex-
ample,  that’s  very  difficult,  because  one  hurricane  going  over  flat 
area  like  Florida  will  produce  so  much  rain,  but  that  same  hurri-
cane  going  over  the  mountains  in  North  Georgia  or  the  Carolinas 
will  produce,  you  know,  a  much  different  rainfall  pattern.  So,  one 
size doesn’t fit all for precipitation. 

We  do  put  rainfall  in  our  advisory  products,  and  then  the  local 
offices fine-tune that. We also put the size of the hurricane in the— 
how  far  out  the  tropical-storm-force  winds  go  and  how  far  out  the 
hurricane-force-winds  go  in  our  advisory.  So,  we’re  addressing 
those  things,  but  it’s  very  difficult  to—for  me  to  understand  how 
you  can  come  up  with  one  index  that—you  know,  I  don’t  think  we 
want  to  have  multiple  indices.  That,  to  me,  would  be  very  con-
fusing.  But  we  would  certainly  welcome  any  ideas  from  the  re-
search community if they could come up with a parameter that en-
compasses everything. 

Senator  VITTER.  Dr.  Levitan,  do  you  have  any  reaction  on  that 

topic? 

Dr. LEVITAN. Certainly for, I think, the technical community, and 
those in the know, that would be valuable. But, on the ground, for 
the  people  who  get  this  who  aren’t,  perhaps,  as  sophisticated  in 
how  that  message  is  understood,  I  think  I  agree  with  Max  that 
that may be more confusing, at that level, to having multiple indi-
ces. 

Senator VITTER. Part of the reason I ask is, clearly, to the public 
at  large,  myself  included,  the  shorthand  is  the  number—one,  two, 
three,  four,  five.  And  it  tends  to  characterize,  in  terms  of  common 
discussion  or  understanding,  everything  about  the  storm,  even

though  it,  in  fact,  describes  only  one  finite  issue,  which  is  wind 
speed. 

Mr.  MAYFIELD.  And—you’re  absolutely  right,  Senator—and  we 
have  really  made  a  conscious  effort—in,  you  know,  interview  after 
interview, I really tried to—in fact, with Katrina I tried to compare 
that  with  the  only  three  known  Category-5  hurricanes  to  make 
landfall  in  the  United  States,  but  I  said  it  was  much,  much  larger 
than  any  of  those  three  Category-5  hurricanes.  So—anyway,  the 
point’s well taken. We do need to do a better job on that. And we’ll 
welcome any suggestions on how to do that. 

Senator  VITTER.  Well,  I’d  just  underscore  that  point.  I  under-
stand  you’ve  been  making  that  effort.  I  just  think,  as  long  as  you 
have  this  grading  system  on  wind  speed,  that’s  what  everybody’s 
going  to  look  to,  and  that’s  the  information  they’re  going  to  focus 
on.  And,  for  instance,  in  this  storm,  obviously  it  was  a  4  and,  at 
some  points  a  5,  so  that’s  major,  but  it  was  so  big,  that  really  ex-
panded the destructive force of it way beyond even a typical 4. 

Mr. MAYFIELD. Absolutely. 
Senator  VITTER.  I  know  we  have  a  vote,  so  I’ll  cut  it  short,  Mr. 

Chairman. Thank you. 

Senator DEMINT. Thank you, Senator Vitter. 
And  I  know  when  I  was  in  a  Coast  Guard  helicopter  a  couple  of 
weeks  ago,  the  captain  that  was  with  me  said  this  was  equivalent 
to  what  would  have  been  ten  Hurricane  Andrews,  as  far  as  the 
amount  of  water  it  pushed  ashore,  which  obviously  had  my  mouth 
hanging  open.  But,  after  seeing  the  destruction,  I  could  believe  it. 
You folks do a great job. One of the primary functions of the Fed-
eral  Government  is  to  protect  its  citizens.  The  best  protection  we 
have  is  a  good  warning  system,  and,  after  that,  a  lot  of  it’s  out  of 
your hands. 

Thank  you  for  being  here  today.  This  is  very  important  testi-

mony. 

And this hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 4:55 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
In  less  than  a  year,  we  have  witnessed  two  deadly  natural  disasters  that  have 
shocked the world and highlighted the urgent need to prepare adequately for almost 
unimaginable events. First, the Indian Ocean tsunami brought the world’s attention 
to the terrible toll tsunami can take on vulnerable coastal areas. But so much closer 
to  home,  we  watched  as  a  disaster  of  the  same  magnitude  struck  our  shores  along 
the Gulf Coast. 

The  causes  were  different—a  tsunami  and  a  coastal  hurricane—but  the  mecha-
nisms  of  coastal  death  and  destruction  are  the  same.  For  Hurricane  Katrina,  we 
were at least adequately warned of its coming, and I commend our witness, Mr. Max 
Mayfield,  and  his  colleagues  at  NOAA—including  NOAA’s  all-hazards  warning  sys-
tem—for doing an outstanding job. 

But  as  with  the  Indian  Ocean  tsunami,  preparation  and  mitigation  response 
plans,  even  if  they  existed,  were  not  well  implemented.  We  must  do  better,  as  I 
know  we  can.  For  example,  early  and  closer  coordination  with  local  governments 
and  emergency  personnel  resulted  in  a  timely  response  to  all  four  hurricanes  in 
Florida last year. 

The Gulf hurricane, however, raised the specter that we have long dreaded—that 
an  coastal  catastrophe  can  threaten  heavily  populated  urban  areas  as  well  as  re-
mote  beachfront  communities.  This  prospect,  first  brought  home  during  9/11,  has 
raised  the  bar  for  government  preparation  and  response  at  the  very  moment  that 
the  billions  we  will  spend  on  Katrina  recovery  and  the  war  in  Iraq  threaten  cuts 
to the Federal domestic budget. 

I am very concerned that this budget pressure will both undermine our ability to 
improve our response capacity in all areas of the country, and erode the exceptional 
level  of  service  provided  by  agencies  such  as  NOAA  and  the  Coast  Guard—who  I 
commend  for  their  impressive  efforts  during  Katrina,  from  prediction  and  warning 
to rescue and response. 

Even  before  Katrina  struck,  we  learned  that  budget  pressures  were  driving  the 
Administration  to  develop  a  plan  to  reduce  hours  and  personnel  in  local  Weather 
Forecast Offices during the next budget cycle. As our witnesses know, that is exactly 
the  wrong  thing  to  be  doing  at  this  time.  As  we  did  during  the  Weather  Service 
Modernization,  I  will  work  with  my  colleagues  to  ensure  that  no  plan  that  erodes 
services to our citizens will ever be implemented. 

From the Committee’s long experience with tsunami, severe storms, fire and other 
disasters,  we  know  that  effective  preparation  for  catastrophic  events  encompasses 
a  series  of  linked  activities  that  must  be  undertaken  cooperatively,  far  in  advance 
of a natural disaster, and with a committed level of funding over the long term. 

First, we must invest in improving detection and prediction of all hazards, includ-

ing tsunami, volcano, earthquake, and weather hazards. 

Second, we must develop a warning and mitigation program that involves all lev-
els  of  government,  and  all  manner  of  experts,  such  as  we  have  done  the  Tsunami 
Hazard Mitigation program. 

In addition, such a program must ensure that people know what to do when they 
are  warned.  Federal,  state,  and  local  governments,  working  with  outside  partners, 
need to have a coordinated response, and each needs to help educate at-risk commu-
nities on how to respond to natural or man-made disasters. After all, no matter how 
people receive a warning, that warning does no good unless people know how to re-
spond. 

The United States can do better at preparing for natural and man-made hazards, 
but  we  cannot  do  so  by  stripping  resources  from  the  agencies  that  provide  our  core 
prediction, warning, and response capabilities. 

This  Committee  must  fully  exercise  its  oversight  authority  on  this  critical  point, 
and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. Through oversight, our combined 
experience,  and  the  help  of  our  expert  witnesses,  this  committee  can  play  a  central

role  in  designing  and  funding  a  more  effective  and  robust,  detection,  warning,  and 
response system for the Nation. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JIM DEMINT TO 

MAX MAYFIELD 

Question  1.  I  understand  that  hurricanes  often  spawn  tornadoes  during  landfall 
and sometimes for several days thereafter. Were tornadoes a problem during Hurri-
cane Katrina? 

Answer.  Tornadoes  almost  always  occur  with  land-falling  hurricanes  and  can 
cause  major  damage,  injuries,  and  death.  Tornadoes  caused  by  Hurricane  Katrina 
occurred  in  Florida,  Georgia,  Alabama,  Mississippi,  and  Louisiana,  as  well  as  in 
Ohio and Virginia as the remains of Hurricane Katrina moved northeast. 

Question 2. Do you have preliminary information on the number of tornado warn-
ings  issued  by  local  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  forecast  offices  during 
Katrina? Is there any preliminary information on tornado-related casualties or prop-
erty damage? 

Answer.  From  August  28–30,  2005,  local  NWS  offices  issued  237  tornado  warn-
ings.  The  warnings  were  issued  by  thirteen  weather  forecast  offices  from  Louisiana 
to Virginia and Pennsylvania. Some of the tornado warnings issued by the New Or-
leans  office  were  for  the  eyewall  of  Katrina,  not  for  specific  tornadoes.  Preliminary 
data suggest approximately 35 tornadoes occurred in association with Katrina, kill-
ing 2 people, injuring 3 and causing destruction hundreds of miles away from where 
the center of the storm made landfall. Most of the reports received thus far mention 
downed trees and power lines, and damage to homes. 

Question  3.  I  understand  that  the  NEXRAD  Radar  System  is  the  primary  tool 
used  by  NWS  forecasters  in  issuing  tornado  warnings.  Would  new  technology  with 
faster  scan  rates  currently  being  researched,  such  as  Phased  Array  Radar,  help  to 
provide better and more advanced tornado warnings during hurricane events? 

Answer.  Yes,  faster  scan  technologies  and  improved  resolution  would  help  Na-
tional  Weather  Service  forecasters  detect  the  precursors  to  tornadoes.  NOAA’s  pre-
liminary  research  indicates  that  phased  array  radar  could  potentially  allow  fore-
casters  to  issue  tornado  warnings  with  an  average  lead  time  of  nearly  20  minutes 
(up from the present national average of 14 minutes in 2005). Tornadoes associated 
with hurricanes tend to be embedded in rain, and are generally smaller and shorter 
lived  than  tornadoes  associated  with  thunderstorms.  Faster  radar  scan  rates  and 
higher  resolution  could  increase  the  chances  of  observing  and  predicting  these 
smaller  tornadoes,  and  improve  our  tornado  warning  capability  during  land-falling 
hurricanes. However, it will take many years to test phased array radar and deter-
mine  whether  it  is  cost  effective  as  a  next-generation  operational  system.  In  the 
near term, NOAA will continue its NEXRAD Product Improvement Program, which 
has already contributed to increased warning time. 

Question  4.  Can  you  provide  information  on  cooperative  past  work  between  the 

National Hurricane Center and the National Severe Storm Labs? 

Answer.  The  Storm  Prediction  Center  (SPC),  one  of  the  nine  centers  in  the  Na-
tional  Centers  for  Environmental  Prediction,  is  co-located  with  the  National  Severe 
Storm  Laboratory  (NSSL)  in  Norman,  Oklahoma.  The  SPC  issues  tornado  watches 
and local weather service offices issue tornado warnings. The SPC collaborates with 
National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  during  land-falling  storms  to  ensure  the  risk  of 
tornadoes  is  assessed  and  coordinated  within  the  agency  and  communicated  to  the 
public.  The  NSSL  and  the  SPC  communicate  on  a  daily  basis  though  the  jointly 
managed Hazardous Weather Testbed. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the NSSL 
worked  with  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  Tropical  Prediction  Center  and 
Hurricane Research Division on extracting information on tornadoes from NEXRAD 
weather  radar  data.  The  results  of  this  research  and  development  are  used  today, 
primarily by local NWS forecast offices, to issue tornado warnings during hurricane 
events. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

MAX MAYFIELD 

Background: Mr. Mayfield is the director of the National Weather Service’s Trop-
ical  Prediction  Center/National  Hurricane  Center  (NHC)  in  Miami,  FL.  In  addition 
to  performing  basic  research,  the  NHC  is  responsible  for  monitoring  all  tropical  cy-
clones in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific (east of 140° W latitude), predicting their 
path,  and  warning  the  public.  The  Central  Pacific  Hurricane  Center  in  Hawaii  has 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  13:25 Jun 16, 2011 Jkt 066856 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\66856.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

71 

a similar responsibility for the Western Pacific except that the NHC has the author-
ity  to  direct  all  aerial  reconnaissance  assets,  known  as  the  Hurricane  Hunters.  In 
his  written  testimony,  Mr.  Mayfield  commented  that  we  appear  to  be  entering  into 
a period of heightened hurricane activity in the Atlantic. 

CLARIFICATION: The National Hurricane Center provides forecast and warnings 
for  hurricanes  and  tropical  systems.  Basic  hurricane  research  is  done  at  the  Hurri-
cane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory 
and  the  Geophysical  Fluid  Dynamics  Laboratory  in  NOAA’s  Office  of  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Research.  The  Central  Pacific  Hurricane  Center  has  responsibility  for 
the  central  Pacific  from  140  degrees  longitude  westward  to  180  degrees  longitude 
(the International Dateline). The U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center (located in the 
Department of Defense) has responsibility for U.S. interests for the western part of 
the Pacific, that is, west of the Dateline. 

Question  1.  You  issued,  from  all  accounts,  accurate  warnings.  You  also  warned 
local officials. What sort of reaction did you get from FEMA and local officials upon 
issuing your warnings? 

Answer.  Our  forecasts  and  warnings  were  well  coordinated  with  the  emergency 
management  community,  including  the  Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency 
(FEMA).  We  only  have  the  expertise  to  comment  on  the  actions  taken  by  NOAA. 
Question  2.  You  have  been  through  many  hurricanes.  In  your  experience,  what 

are the typical Federal reactions pre- and post-hurricanes? 

Answer. The responsibility of the National Hurricane Center is to provide the best 
possible  meteorological  information  and  forecasts  for  hurricanes.  The  National 
Weather  Service  (NWS)  forecast  track  error  for  Hurricane  Katrina  was  better  than 
the 10 year average. After the storm made landfall, the NWS provided high quality 
forecast  and  warning  services  to  the  affected  areas.  We  only  have  the  expertise  to 
comment on the actions taken by NOAA. 

Question  3.  In  your  prepared  remarks,  you  commented  on  the  increasing  number 
of hurricanes occurring in the Atlantic. Is there also a similarly heightened cyclone 
activity in the Pacific? 

Answer. No, the activity in the Northeast and North Central Pacific has decreased 
in  recent  years.  There  appears  to  be  an  inverse  relationship,  with  respect  to  hurri-
cane  activity,  observed  in  the  Pacific  and  Atlantic  basins.  The  long-term  average 
number  of  hurricanes  in  the  Atlantic  is  approximately  6  per  year,  and  about  9  per 
year in the Northeast and North Central Pacific. While the Atlantic has been more 
active during the last decade, experiencing about 8 hurricanes per season (compared 
to the average, 6), the Northeast and North Central Pacific has averaged only 7 hur-
ricanes  a  season  (compared  to  9).  In  contrast,  during  the  mid-1980s  to  the  mid- 
1990s  the  Atlantic  was  relatively  quiet  (5  hurricanes  per  season),  and  the  Pacific 
averaged 11 hurricanes per season. The 1997 and 2002 hurricane seasons were par-
ticularly  active  in  the  Pacific  basin,  and  correspond  to  the  quietest  seasons  in  the 
Atlantic during the last decade; this is a result of the influence of the El Nin˜ o phe-
nomenon.  El  Nin˜ o,  a  warming  of  the  equatorial  eastern  Pacific  waters,  causes 
changes in global weather patterns. El Nin˜ o tends to cause quiet Atlantic and busy 
Northeast and North Central Pacific hurricane seasons. The 2005 hurricane season 
continues the inverse trend in hurricane activity in the Atlantic and Pacific basins; 
there  have  been  12  hurricanes  in  the  Atlantic,  compared  to  7  hurricanes  in  the 
Northeast and North Central Pacific. 

Question  4.  How  does  coverage  of  the  Pacific  compare  with  the  Atlantic  in  terms 
of  NOAA  resources?  How  many  Hurricane  Hunters  are  based  in  the  Western  Pa-
cific?  Is  the  staff  of  the  Central  Pacific  Hurricane  Center  comparable  to  the  staff 
of the NHC? 

Answer.  Forecast  and  warning  services  for  the  central  Pacific  region  are  high 
quality.  Although  the  last  direct  hurricane  to  strike  the  Hawaiian  Islands  occurred 
in  1992,  when  Hurricane  Iniki  struck  Kauai,  other  hurricanes  approached  Hawaii 
in 2005, 2003, 2000, 1998, 1997, 1994, and 1993. 

NOAA  Aircraft  are  stationed  at  the  NOAA  Aircraft  Operations  Center,  MacDill 
AFB in Tampa, FL; the U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters are stationed at 
Keesler  Air  Force  Base,  in  Mississippi.  If  forecasters  at  the  Central  Pacific  Hurri-
cane  Center  believe  a  hurricane  will  impact  Hawaii,  they  may  request  reconnais-
sance  aircraft.  The  aircraft  then  fly  to  Hawaii  to  provide  detailed  in-situ  observa-
tions  to  improve  the  forecast  of  the  track  and  intensity,  both  by  providing  data  for 
the  forecasters  and  also  providing  data  for  better  initialization  of  the  numerical 
guidance models. 

The  Central  Pacific  Hurricane  Center  (CPHC)  functions  both  as  a  local  Weather 
Forecast  Office  and  as  a  national  center  for  aviation,  marine,  and  hurricane  pro-
grams  in  the  Pacific.  As  a  result  of  this  combined  mission,  the  CPHC  has  no  dedi-

72 

cated  hurricane  forecasters.  When  a  tropical  cyclone  enters  or  forms  in  the  central 
Pacific  (140°  W  to  180° ),  additional  forecasters  (certified  as  hurricane  specialists) 
are  called  in  to  provide  the  extra  staffing  required  to  meet  the  hurricane  forecast 
products  and  services  needs.  The  number  of  additional  staff  called  in  increases  as 
the possible threat of the hurricane impacting Hawaii increases. 

Question 5. What types of resources are needed to better track cyclones in the Pa-

cific—buoys, aircraft, etc.? 

Answer.  Additional  observations  and  directional  wave  information  would  con-
tribute  to  further  improving  hurricane  intensity  and  track  forecasts  in  the  Pacific. 
Hurricane track forecasts in the Pacific continue to improve. In 1984, in the Central 
Pacific Ocean the 48-hour track forecast had an average error of about 250 nautical 
miles.  By  2004,  the  48-hour  track  forecast  error  was  reduced  to  about  150  nautical 
miles.  The  Global  Earth  Observation  System  of  Systems  (GEOSS),  a  10-year  inter-
national endeavor of which the United States is a member and NOAA, the National 
Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration,  and  U.S.  Geological  Survey  are  key  partici-
pants  will  address  observational  enhancements  to  improve  hurricane  forecasting. 
GEOSS  includes  a  number  of  different  data  collection  systems  such  as  buoys,  sat-
ellites, and surface base weather instruments. 

NOAA also works to continually improve its numerical weather forecasting models 
to  improve  track  and  intensity  forecasts  in  the  Pacific.  To  improve  the  model  guid-
ance,  in  collaboration  with  many  scientists  and  developers  in  the  domestic  and 
international  operational  Numerical  Weather  Prediction  (NWP)  centers,  NOAA’s 
Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) develops state of the art numerical modeling 
systems.  Through  continued  collaboration  between  NOAA’s  Geophysical  Fluid  Dy-
namics  Laboratory  (GFDL)  and  EMC,  NOAA’s  high-resolution  hurricane  models, 
which have provided track and intensity guidance over the past 10 years, are being 
continually  improved  and  upgraded.  Predicting  hurricane  intensity  remains  one  of 
our main challenges. For example, even though the forecasters may know conditions 
are favorable for hurricanes to intensify, there are sometimes large errors in the in-
tensity  forecast  in  the  Pacific  and  Atlantic  due  to  rapid  intensification.  Through 
NWP  advancements,  the  2005  research  version  of  NOAA’s  high-resolution  model, 
when  run  on  data  from  several  2004  hurricanes,  improved  some  intensity  forecasts 
when  compared  to  the  forecasts  provided  by  the  2004  version.  To  further  advance 
hurricane  prediction,  especially  hurricane  intensity  and  size  forecasts,  NOAA  is  de-
veloping  the  Hurricane  Weather  and  Research  Forecasting  (HWRF)  system.  The 
HWRF  system  uses  a  collaborative  approach  among  the  research  community  and 
will  apply  advanced  model  physics  as  HWRF  combines  the  atmosphere,  land,  and 
ocean into an integrated model. Our goal is to couple an advanced wave model with 
a  dynamic  storm  surge  model  to  better  predict  coastal  impacts  of  waves  and  storm 
surge as well as predict hurricane intensity and size. 

Included in the President’s $17.1B reallocation package for Hurricane Katrina re-
lief  and  recovery,  submitted  to  Congress  on  October  28,  2005,  is  $54.6M  in  funding 
for  NOAA,  containing  several  enhancements  to  hurricane  forecasting  and  modeling 
activities.  Among  the  NOAA  requests  are  investments  to  complete  an  accelerated 
implementation  of  the  HWRF  System,  add  enhancements  to  the  Global  Forecast 
System to improve forecasting of hurricane intensity and structure, and add a third 
P–3 Hurricane Hunter aircraft. 

Background: All of the witnesses would agree that better coordination among fed-
eral, state and local partners would result in more lives saved through storm prepa-
ration,  planning,  and  response.  While  the  NHC  has  established  federal,  state,  and 
local Hurricane Liaison Teams that activate before each hurricane, and Florida has 
developed  its  own  mitigation  program,  there  is  no  specific  comprehensive  national 
program  aimed  particularly  at  storm  hazard  mitigation  at  the  federal,  state  and 
local  level.  However,  this  committee  has  created  them  in  other  legislation  we  have 
passed.  Such  a  model  would  be  appropriate  to  look  at  given  the  failure  of  response 
in Katrina. 

Though  this  Disaster  Subcommittee  is  a  new  creation,  we  have  long  been  active 
here  at  the  Commerce  Committee  in  addressing  weather  issues.  Most  recently  we 
included  a  new  Coastal  Vulnerability  Assessment  Program  in  the  Tsunami  Pre-
paredness  Act,  which  the  Senate  passed.  We  have  also  enacted  the  Inland  Flood 
Warning  Act  of  2002  and  the  National  Windstorm  Impact  Reduction  Act  of  2004. 
Question  6.  Given  that  Katrina  has  highlighted  the  need  for  better  storm  pre-
paredness  at  all  levels  of  government,  wouldn’t  the  multi-agency  and  federal-local 
structure of many of these programs make sense to emulate? 

Answer.  We  believe  the  existing  structure  for  the  hurricane  program  can  work 
well,  by  focusing  on  increased  efforts  in  public  education,  preparedness  and  pre-

be the last catastrophic storm to make landfall in the United States, we believe the 
existing  structure  can  work  well,  as  exemplified  by  the  response  to  the  four  major 
hurricanes that hit Florida in 2004. Because there is always room for improvement, 
we  should  continue  to  take  in  lessons  learned  from  Katrina  and  work  to  make  the 
system more efficient. 

Question  7.  Please  explain  the  benefits  of  adopting  this  model  of  integrating  re-
search, technology, hazard mitigation, and community preparedness in one program 
to help organize preparedness for severe coastal storms. 

Answer. NOAA works with Federal and university partners to coordinate research 
efforts; with federal, state and local emergency managers for preparedness and edu-
cation  efforts  to  understand  the  potential  impact  from  these  storms;  and  with  the 
public at large to provide forecasts and warnings in a timely fashion to allow people 
to  take  action.  NOAA  and  other  Federal  agencies  are  part  of  the  National  Hazards 
Mitigation  Plan,  where  all  aspects  of  natural  hazards  are  addressed.  The  National 
Hurricane Operations Plan, compiled each year by the Office of the Federal Coordi-
nator  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Research,  address  hurricane  program  activi-
ties across the Federal Government. 

NOAA  has  increased  our  efforts  to  integrate  research  and  technology,  as  dem-
onstrated  by  the  Joint  Hurricane  Testbed  (JHT)  under  the  United  States  Weather 
Research  Program  (USWRP),  which  was  formed  in  late  2000.  The  mission  of  the 
JHT  is  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of  new  technology,  research  results,  and  observa-
tional  advances  of  the  USWRP,  its  sponsoring  agencies,  the  academic  community, 
and  the  private  sector  for  improved  operational  tropical  cyclone  analysis  and  pre-
diction. 

Question  8.  Shouldn’t  we  establish  a  Severe  Storm  Hazard  Mitigation  Program, 
similar to the one we established for Tsunami, to ensure all the right federal, state, 
and  local  entities  are  working  together  toward  the  same  goal  before  the  hurricane 
appears on the horizon? 

Answer. Federal, state, and local governments have been aware of the threats as-
sociated  with  hurricanes  for  decades.  These  threats  have  been  receiving  increased 
attention, even before last year’s record breaking number of U.S. land-falling storms 
and  this  year’s  catastrophic  impacts.  We  believe  all  appropriate  federal,  state  and 
local entities are currently working together toward the same goal. For example, the 
work  of  the  Office  of  the  Federal  Coordinator  for  Meteorological  Services  and  Re-
search  addresses  hurricane  program  activities  across  the  Federal  Government,  and 
the  ever-increasing  number  of  participants  attending  the  annual,  privately-run  Na-
tional Hurricane Conference attests to the heightened awareness and increased em-
phasis being placed on the potential impact from hurricanes.
