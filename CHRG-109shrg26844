REAUTHORIZATION  OF  AMTRAK 

THURSDAY,  APRIL  21,  2005

SUBCOMMITTEE ON SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND 
MERCHANT MARINE, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  9:30  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building.  Hon.  Trent  Lott,
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT LOTT,

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI 

Senator LOTT. If the hearing will come to order, we will go ahead 
and get started with my opening statement and then we will move 
to the witness testimony, we’re going to have a number of Senators 
that will be joining us this morning, we expect eight or ten, but we 
work on Senate time, which is about 15 minutes late. But we’ll get 
started anyway, so we can sort of set the parameters on this hear-
ing. 

I want to thank the witnesses for being here, I’m looking forward 
to  hearing  your  testimony,  and  I’m  also  looking  forward  to  having 
the  chance  for  the  Committee  to  ask  some  questions,  and  try  to 
begin to get a vision of where we really want to go. 

This  morning  the  Subcommittee  on  Surface  Transportation  and 
Merchant  Marine  will  be  receiving  testimony  on  the  policy  issues 
surrounding  the  reauthorization  of  Amtrak.  As  Chairman  of  this 
Subcommittee,  enacting  legislation  to  reform  Amtrak  is  one  of  my 
top  priorities  for  this  session  of  Congress.  I  am  willing  to  work 
hard on developing consensus, bipartisan legislation, but only if the 
legislation  truly  improves  the  situation  and  makes  some  sense  for 
the future. 

Ten  years  ago,  when  I  also  served  as  Chairman  of  this  Sub-
committee,  I  helped  write  the  legislation  which  eventually  became 
the Amtrak Reform Act of 1997. Unfortunately, for a variety of rea-
sons,  I’m  sure,  many  of  the  Act’s  provisions  intended  to  improve 
Amtrak’s  performance  were  never  used.  Despite  assurances  from 
Amtrak management at the time that the railroad was on a ‘‘glide 
path  to  self-sufficiency,’’  Amtrak  still  requires  large  Federal  oper-
ating subsidies. One of my goals for today’s hearing is to determine 
why  we  didn’t  use  more  of  the  1997  legislation,  what  was  wrong 
with  the  way  we  wrote  it,  and  make  sure  that  we  don’t  repeat 
those mistakes, come up with some new and different ideas.

I  also  think  that  it’s  important  we  are  honest  with  ourselves 
about  what  are  the  prospects  for  Amtrak  or  whatever  we  have  in 
its  place  to  actually  ever  make  a  profit,  or  to  be  self-sufficient.  If 
that’s  not  going  to  happen,  we  need  to  acknowledge  it,  if  it’s  not 
going to happen, but if we want to keep it or some form of it, how 
are we going to fund it? 

We  put  that  decision  off  long  enough.  This  is  the  year  where  we 
have  to  make  the  cut,  make  the  decision.  Today  we  will  basically 
hear  three  proposals  on  how  to  proceed  with  intercity  rail.  First 
we’ll  hear  from  the  Administration.  The  President  proposed  zero 
funding  for  Amtrak—as  I  understand  it,  not  to  kill  it,  but  to  send 
Congress  a  wake-up  call  that  the  time  to  reform  Amtrak  is  now. 
I hope that was their thinking, and I hope that we get the message 
without  actually  killing  it.  In  a  way  it  could  happen,  we  didn’t  get 
the  legislation  last  year  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  no  use  trying  to 
re-hash that, we’re going to get something this year, one way or the 
other, we’re going to make a decision. 

Now  last  week  the  Administration  re-submitted  its  legislation 
proposal  for  reforming  Amtrak,  I’m  sure  we’ll  hear  about  that 
today,  and  while  I  think  some  of  its  provisions  are  totally  unreal-
istic,  some  of  them  maybe  can  be  used,  and  we’ll  try  to  decide 
which is which. 

Second,  the  Amtrak  Board  and  David  Gunn,  the  Amtrak  Presi-
dent  and  CEO,  have  put  together  a  Strategic  Reform  Initiative  in-
cluding  some  legislative  proposals.  I  think  the  Board  should  be 
commended  for  its  hard  work  in  developing  this  initiative,  which 
in  many  ways  is  a  departure  from  some  of  the  past  thinking  that 
we’ve had from the Board. 

Finally,  we’ll  hear  from  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  In-
spector General, who has worked on these Amtrak issues for many 
years,  both  at  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  at  the  Gen-
eral Accounting Office. His testimony proposes an outline for a new 
model  of  intercity  passenger  rail.  I’ve  found  his  testimony  in  the 
past  to  be  very  helpful,  our  private  discussions  have  been  giving 
me  some  ideas  of  what  we  need  to  do,  and  so  I  look  forward  to 
hearing from all the witnesses. 

It  is  my  intent  to,  after  this  hearing,  after  consultation  with  the 
Chairman of the full Committee, to begin to actually develop a bill. 
It  is  my  intent  that  it  consider  all  the  aspects  of  where  we  need 
to go, where we can go, it’s my intent for it to be bipartisan, I want 
the Administration to be involved. Among other things, I’ve already 
met  with  management,  with  the  Secretary  of  Transportation,  the 
Inspector  General,  Mr.  Gunn,  labor,  and  have  talked  to  a  number 
of  Senators  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle,  including  Senator  Lauten-
berg. 

We’re  going  to  get  this  done,  and  we’re  going  to  have  something 
ready to go to the floor this summer. We’re going to beat the dead-
line  of  having  to  get  something  done  before  the  end  of  this  fiscal 
year.  We’ll  have  to  get  the  votes,  but  we’re  going  to  come  up  with 
something, and I hope it’s something worth having. 

Senator Lautenberg?

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  you’re  an  inspiration  this 
morning  and  I’m  glad  to  see  that  energy  and  vitality  focused  on 
what we do about Amtrak and what we do about making sure that 
we  have  a  transportation  system  that  reflects  the  needs  of  the 
country.  And  I  am  appreciative  of  the  fact  that  you’re  holding  this 
hearing on the reauthorization of Amtrak. 

It’s  been  8  years  since  we  last  authorized  Amtrak.  At  that  time 
I  was,  I  look  back  with  some  envy,  I  was  Ranking  Member  of  the 
Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, sabbaticals aren’t all 
that they’re cracked up to be, Mr. Chairman. 

I  can’t  overstate  how  important  it  is  for  our  country,  as  I  see  it, 
to  have  a  balanced,  national  transportation  system.  We’ve  got  an 
interstate  highway  system,  we  have  a  national  system  of  airports 
to facilitate air travel, but passenger rail has fallen by the wayside 
in  our  country,  and  even  if  you  want  to  take  the  train,  service  is 
limited.  And  in  many  parts  of  the  country  it  isn’t  an  option  at  all, 
and we can do better, and we must. 

Providing  another  transportation  choice  isn’t  just  a  matter  of 
convenience—I  see  it  as  a  matter  of  national  security,  to  ensure 
that  we  don’t  depend  entirely  on  one  mode  of  travel  if  a  problem 
strikes. Many Americans would choose to take a train if they could, 
and  many  already  do.  Thousands  of  senior  citizens  use  Amtrak 
service to Florida rather than brave the traffic and the large trucks 
on I–95. 

Now,  I  understand  that  there  are  many  ideas  about  how  to  run 
passenger rail service in our country. There are some facts that we 
must consider. First, it’s going to take money to do it. Zero will not 
cut  it.  No  passenger  system  in  the  world  makes  money,  not  even 
Japan’s. 

Second,  the  states  cannot  afford  at  this  time  to  simply  pick  up 
the Federal contribution to Amtrak. Expecting them to do so would 
be yet another unfunded mandate, and it would sink state budgets 
into a sea of red ink. 

Thirdly,  we  need  to  heed  the  lessons  of  other  countries  that  em-
barked  on  flights  of  fancy  by  privatizing  their  railroads.  They 
risked  the  safety  of  their  operations,  and  they  ended  up  paying 
more  in  the  end.  Every  organization  needs  strong  leadership.  And 
Amtrak,  I’m  pleased  to  say,  has  that.  And  under  President  and 
CEO  David  Gunn,  Amtrak  has  overhauled  its  financial  accounting 
system, trimmed its workforce by 20 percent, while adding 20 per-
cent more trains. 

Last  year,  Amtrak  achieved  record  ridership  of  25  million  riders 
nationwide.  I  remind  you,  the  equivalent  of  125,000  fully  loaded 
757  airplanes.  Amtrak  works,  and  Americans  depend  on  Amtrak 
every day, we sure can tell by some of the protests that have arisen 
about  removing  sellers  from  the  line.  But  we  needed  it  most,  Am-
trak, when our Nation was attacked on September 11, 2001. 

When  our  commercial  aviation  system  was  shut  down  on  9/11, 
stranded  passengers  turned  to  Amtrak  to  reunite  themselves  with 
their  families.  And  thank  goodness  they  had  that  choice.  That  ter-
rible  day  reminded  us  that  our  Nation  cannot  depend  entirely  on 
one mode of transportation, no matter how attractive it looks. And

since  the  Federal  Government  created  Amtrak  34  years  ago,  we’ve 
invested an average of less than $1 billion a year in rail infrastruc-
ture and operations, not nearly enough for a world class system. 

Germany has a modern high-speed rail system. They invested $9 
billion in passenger rail service in 2003 alone, and instead of trying 
to  kill  Amtrak,  we’ve  got  to  find  a  way  to  build  a  passenger  rail 
system  that’s  as  good  as  any  in  the  world.  And  I  thank  you,  Mr. 
Chairman,  once  again,  for  calling  the  hearing  and  for  your  vitality 
and promise that we’re going to get a railroad bill, that Amtrak go 
out  of  here,  and  I  plan  to  work  with  you  on  it,  and  hope  that  we 
come  up  with  something  that  really  spells  out  not  only  the  prob-
lems, but how we’re going to do it long term. 

Senator  LOTT.  Thank  you,  Senator  Lautenberg.  Our  witnesses 
today  are  the  Honorable  Jeffrey  L.  Rosen,  General  Counsel,  and 
Secretary’s representative to the Amtrak Board at the Department 
of  Transportation;  David  Laney,  Esquire,  Chairman  of  the  Board, 
National  Railroad  Passenger  Corporation  or  Amtrak;  David  Gunn, 
the  President  and  CEO  of  the  National  Railroad  Passenger  Cor-
poration—Amtrak;  and  the  Honorable  Kenneth  Mead,  Inspector 
General  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation.  We  will  call  on 
you in that order. Mr. Mead, we’re saving you for clean up and for 
comments on many of the things that you will hear before your tes-
timony,  so  get  prepared,  take  notes.  And,  we’ll  begin,  then,  with 
Mr. Rosen. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JEFFREY A. ROSEN, GENERAL COUNSEL, 

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Lautenberg, 
thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you today about 
reforming  Amtrak.  The  Department  of  Transportation  has  pre-
viously  submitted  my  written  testimony,  which  I  hope  you  will  in-
clude in the record. 

Senator LOTT. It will be included in the record. I might say that 
all of your prepared statements will be included in the record, we’d 
appreciate  it  if  you’d  summarize  it  in  as  close  to  5  minutes  as  you 
can. 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Absolutely,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’ll  be  rel-
atively  brief  in  my  oral  remarks.  I  wanted  to  cover  just  three 
points. 

First,  it  is  now  clear  that  we  have  arrived  at  a  moment  when 
true reform of intercity passenger rail is necessary, is possible and 
should be achieved. Amtrak itself now agrees that reform is needed 
because Amtrak is not sustainable as currently structured or fund-
ed.  Over  the  last  several  months,  Secretary  Mineta  has  traveled 
the  Nation,  meeting  with  railroad  workers,  state  governors  and 
transportation  officials,  weekday  commuters,  city  mayors  and  just 
about anyone else who would listen to his message that the 1970’s 
approach  to  Amtrak  can’t  survive,  and  has  shared  with  them  the 
Administration’s  new  vision  for  intercity  passenger  rail.  Members 
of  this  Subcommittee  and  others  in  Congress  have  also  expressed 
both  interest  and  concern  about  the  future  of  intercity  passenger 
rail,  and  of  course  the  President’s  budget  proposal  for  Amtrak  is 
itself a call to action.

5

So,  the  actions  taken  by  President  Bush  and  Secretary  Mineta 
have  helped  us  lead  the  way  and  it  is  a  welcome  and  perhaps  an 
unprecedented development to have Amtrak itself ready to embrace 
genuine  reform.  I  have  had  the  privilege  of  serving  as  Secretary 
Mineta’s  designee  to  the  Amtrak  Board,  so  I  am  respectful  of  the 
extraordinary  efforts  of  Amtrak’s  highly  committed  management 
and staff, and have observed how closely they worked with a Board 
of  Directors,  who  themselves  added  a  reservoir  of  business  experi-
ence and insight to Amtrak’s strategic planning process. This hear-
ing comes at an opportune time, and hopefully will enable the Con-
gress  to  capitalize  on  this  historic  opportunity  for  reform  as  you 
outlined, Mr. Chairman. 

Second,  as  we  talk  about  specific  reform  measures,  the  fun-
damentals of what needs to be done to save intercity passenger rail 
are,  in  my  view,  clear.  With,  perhaps,  the  potential  for  a  new  con-
sensus  on  some  key  items  that  both  the  Administration  and  Am-
trak are agreed upon, if you compare the two sets of proposals. 

Last week, Secretary Mineta re-transmitted the Administration’s 
proposed reform legislation to Congress, while again reiterating his 
five  key  principles  for  intercity  passenger  rail  reform.  Amtrak’s 
own newly announced strategic initiatives adapt and endorse many 
of  the  same  concepts  and  proposals.  Agreement  exists  on  such 
things  as  transitioning  to  competition,  empowering  the  states  to 
make  infrastructure  decisions  and  to  receive  support  from  a  State/
Federal funding partnership, providing for state involvement in in-
frastructure  decisions  affecting  the  Northeast  Corridor,  introduc-
tion  of  sound  economics  to  eliminate  train  operating  subsidies  and 
reduced  expenses,  improved  financial  reporting  and  transparency, 
and  enabling  the  separation  of  Amtrak’s  train  operations  from  the 
infrastructure role. 

The  areas  of  commonality  and  overlap  between  the  Administra-
tion  bill  and  the  Amtrak  plan  provide  at  least  a  common  baseline 
that  can  be  a  starting  point  for  a  reauthorization  process  that  can 
help us save intercity passenger rail travel. 

Third  and  last,  however,  I  nonetheless  want  to  underscore  that 
reform, to be meaningful and long-lasting, requires both implemen-
tation  and  legislation.  Implementation  involves  the  detailed  spe-
cifics in the followup. And the legislative effort will continue to in-
volve  some  hard  choices.  Because  notwithstanding  the  many  areas 
of commonality that are emerging, there are, of course, other areas 
of  divergence  that  will  require  careful  consideration  by  the  Con-
gress. 

One example that needs to be highlighted is the question of what 
to do with approximately $3.8 billion of Amtrak’s existing debt, the 
repayment  of  which  amounts  to  nearly  $280  million  per  year.  The 
Administration  proposal  differs  from  some  others,  in  that  we  have 
not endorsed absolving Amtrak and its lenders of responsibility for 
those  privately  made  loans.  This  issue,  as  well  as  some  others,  re-
main to be worked out. However, we hope to work closely with the 
Congress  to  achieve  the  ultimate  goal  of  finding  a  total  package 
that  will  save  intercity  passenger  rail,  introduce  a  new  State/Fed-
eral  partnership  for  rail  infrastructure,  enable  competition  for  the 
selection of train operators, and provide the rail passengers in this 
country  with  the  high  quality  service  they  need  and  they  deserve.

So, I want to thank the Subcommittee for holding this very time-

ly hearing, and I would be pleased to respond to any questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Rosen follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. JEFFREY A. ROSEN, GENERAL COUNSEL, 

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Chairman Lott, Senator Inouye, and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the 
opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  represent  Secretary  of  Transportation 
Norman  Y.  Mineta  and  the  Administration  as  this  Congress  takes  up  the  very  im-
portant issue of reform of intercity passenger rail service. If my testimony today ac-
complishes  one  thing,  I  hope  it  is  to  convince  you  that  fundamental  change  in  the 
way we support intercity passenger rail service is not only necessary but inevitable. 
And that change needs to happen this year, before we spend one more taxpayer dol-
lar to prop up a fundamentally broken system. 

The  passenger  rail  service  model  created  by  the  Federal  Government  in  1970  is 
not  viable  in  2005.  The  model  created  in  1970  was  a  single  national  monopoly  set 
up  to  be  a  private  corporation  but  it  has  instead  become  like  a  government  agency 
relying  on  Federal  support  to  survive,  with  a  legacy  system  of  routes  incapable  of 
adapting  to  market  forces  and  demographic  changes.  It  has  little  in  common  with 
our  other  modes  of  transportation  and  the  deregulatory  and  market-oriented 
changes other modes have experienced in the last three decades. America’s transpor-
tation  system  as  a  whole—our  system  of  roads,  airports,  waterways,  transit  lines, 
and  the  mostly  private  operators  who  use  them—provides  excellent  mobility, 
connectivity,  and  efficiency  that  have  undergirded  our  economic  growth.  Sadly, 
intercity passenger rail has been a different story. The supposedly private for-profit 
corporation  set  up  in  1970  to  provide  all  intercity  passenger  rail  nationally  has 
never  once  covered  its  own  costs,  much  less  made  a  profit.  And  the  Federal  tax-
payers  have  infused  more  than  $29  billion  during  the  last  34  years  as  Amtrak  has 
lurched  from  crisis  to  crisis  without  ever  achieving  a  stable  and  viable  business 
model. Whatever one thinks of Amtrak or passenger rail more generally, this situa-
tion has been good for no one. 

To some, perhaps this is old news. Congress looked for change in the Amtrak Re-
form  and  Accountability  Act  of  1997,  and  actually  indicated  that  ‘‘Federal  financial 
assistance to cover operating losses incurred by Amtrak should be eliminated by the 
year  2002.’’  In  fact,  the  notion  that  Amtrak  should  operate  free  from  Federal  oper-
ating  subsidies  is  codified  in  the  United  States  Code.  49  U.S.C.  § 24101(d)  states 
that  ‘‘Commencing  no  later  than  the  fiscal  year  following  the  fifth  anniversary  of 
the  Amtrak  Reform  and  Accountability  Act  of  1997,  Amtrak  shall  operate  without 
Federal operating grant funds appropriated for its benefit.’’ In the 1997 Act, Amtrak 
was  afforded  new  flexibility  to  get  its  own  house  in  order.  But  by  2002,  Amtrak’s 
situation was no better; to the contrary, it had grown worse, with massive increases 
in  Amtrak’s  debt,  continuing  operating  problems,  and  financial  crises  in  both  2001 
and 2002. Amtrak’s response once again was to turn to the Federal Government for 
even  greater  Federal  financial  assistance.  In  no  other  functioning  service  market 
would rising costs and declining revenues be defined as a ‘‘success’’ if this produced 
a small increase in the number of customers. Yet, that is exactly what the defenders 
of  the  1970  approach  now  say,  as  if  the  loss  for  each  rider  were  ‘‘made  up  in  vol-
ume.’’  In  2004,  Amtrak  increased  its  ridership  by  approximately  4  percent  to  a 
record  25  million  passengers,  asked  for  a  record  $1.8  billion  Federal  subsidy,  and 
recorded a financial loss of more than $1.3 billion, of which approximately $635 mil-
lion was a cash loss. 1 

Things do not have to be this way. The Administration has made clear that there 
is  an  important  role  for  intercity  passenger  rail  in  our  transportation  system,  with 
a  new  model  that  will  be  responsive  to  the  needs  of  the  traveling  public.  But  we 
can  only  get  there  by  reforming  the  failed  model  of  1970,  and  committing  to  a  new 
approach.  Happily,  Amtrak  itself  now  recognizes  the  need  for  reform,  and  we  have 
reached  a  time  when  a  new  approach  may  now  be  possible.  It  is  from  this  stand-
point that I am pleased to be here today to discuss the future of intercity rail. 

In  my  testimony  today  I  will  cover  three  things.  First,  I  will  provide  a  summary 
of  the  historical  trends  and  current  state  of  Amtrak’s  provision  of  passenger  rail 
service. Second, I will briefly review some recent history of Amtrak efforts to sustain 
itself and the events leading up to the near-crisis situation we face today in intercity 
passenger  rail  service.  And  finally,  I  will  outline  the  Administration’s  approach  to

saving  intercity  passenger  rail  and  setting  the  platform  for  its  viability  in  the  fu-
ture. 
I. Riding the Rails: Amtrak’s Past and Present 

Amtrak  was  created  in  1970  as  a  private  corporation  in  a  major  restructuring  of 
the  larger  rail  industry,  which  was  in  a  state  of  major  financial  distress.  In  that 
restructuring,  freight  railroads  ceased  providing  passenger  service  altogether.  In-
stead,  for  the  first  time,  there  would  be  a  single  national  provider  of  intercity  pas-
senger rail service to replace the multiple regional systems that reflected the areas 
covered by each of the freight railroads’ route systems. The intent was that the na-
tional monopoly would reinvigorate passenger rail by permitting Amtrak to consoli-
date operations and achieve efficiencies that, after a very brief period of Federal as-
sistance,  would  preserve  and  expand  intercity  passenger  rail  service  as  a  for-profit 
company. 

By  now  we  know  that  the  hopes  of  Amtrak’s  creators  have  never  been  realized. 
Intercity  passenger  rail  service  has  not  been  reinvigorated.  The  Department  of 
Transportation (DOT) expects that each and every one of Amtrak’s 15 long-distance 
trains will this year lose money on a fully allocated cost basis, even excluding depre-
ciation  and  interest.  On  a  per  passenger  basis,  with  depreciation  and  interest,  the 
loss  for  long-distance  trains  ranges  from  $47  per  passenger  to  $466  per  passenger. 
But  the  long-distance  trains  are  not  alone:  with  depreciation  and  interest  included, 
every one of Amtrak’s 43 regularly scheduled routes loses money. After 34 years and 
$29 billion in Federal subsidies, intercity passenger rail’s financial performance has 
not  improved,  service  and  on-time  performance  are  below  expectations,  and  pas-
senger  rail’s  market  share  relative  to  other  modes  has  continued  to  erode.  Last 
year’s  so-called  ‘‘record’’  Amtrak  ridership  amounted  to  a  one-half  of  one  percent 
share  of  the  total  intercity  passenger  transportation  market.  Airlines  alone  carry 
more U.S. passengers in three weeks than Amtrak does in a year.

That  also  belies  one  of  the  frequent  arguments  of  today’s  defenders  of  the  1970 
model—that  the  Federal  Government  supposedly  subsidizes  other  modes  of  trans-
portation at a much greater rate than Amtrak. In fact, FY 2005’s appropriated sub-
sidy of $1.207 billion represented approximately 9 percent of the total discretionary 
Federal funds for the Department—9 percent of the subsidy goes for one-half of one 
percent  of  the  market.  The  argument  also  passes  quickly  over  another  important 
fact:  highways,  transit  and  aviation  are,  unlike  rail,  funded  substantially  by  true

user  fees  and  also  by  state  investments.  (Even  the  most  ardent  rail  proponents 
evince little interest in a new Federal passenger rail ticket tax.) 

Perhaps  most  importantly,  however,  the  argument  overlooks  that  Federal  finan-
cial  support  for  roads,  airports,  and  transit  goes  to  infrastructure  and  not  to  oper-
ations.  In  other  modes  of  transportation,  Federal  aid  goes  to  highway  and  airport 
infrastructure,  for  example,  but  Federal  taxpayers  are  not  regularly  asked  to  write 
annual  billion  dollar  checks  to  private  trucking  companies,  private  bus  companies, 
private  automobile  commuters  and  vacationers,  nor  even  to  private  airlines,  al-
though the taxpayers have regularly done so with regard to Amtrak. 

In  considering  where  we  are  with  Amtrak,  it  is  useful  to  consider  the  varied 
things  that  Amtrak  presently  does.  Generally,  these  can  be  grouped  into  activities 
relating  to  rail  infrastructure,  corridor  train  operations,  and  long-distance  train 
service. 
Rail Infrastructure 

Amtrak owns its own right of way and infrastructure along most of the Northeast 
Corridor  (NEC),  except  in  Massachusetts  and  part  of  Connecticut,  where  the  infra-
structure is owned by those states. Amtrak also owns some infrastructure in Michi-
gan, as well as train stations in a number of states. Otherwise, Amtrak mostly oper-
ates trains on infrastructure owned by others. 

Within the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak controls the infrastructure not only for its 

own use, but for use by numerous other railroads and transit agencies.

List of Users of the NEC Other than Amtrak
Canadian Pacific 
Consolidated Rail Corporation 
CSX 
Delaware DOT 
Long Island Rail Road 
Maryland Rail Commuter Service 
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 
Metro-North Commuter Railroad 
New Jersey Transit 
Norfolk Southern 
Providence and Worcester Railroad 
Rhode Island DOT 
Shore Line East (Connecticut) 
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority 
Virginia Railway Express

These other users of the NEC pay Amtrak for access and associated services, such 
as  train  dispatching.  In  total,  trains  operated  by  other  users  on  the  NEC  actually 
exceed the number of trains operated by Amtrak itself on the NEC. 

Because  of  the  way  the  1970  model  of  intercity  passenger  rail  was  organized, 
maintenance  and  development  of  infrastructure  for  passenger  rail  has  been  left  to 
Amtrak. 

In  FY05,  Amtrak  plans  to  spend  $215  million  on  fixed  facility  infrastructure 
projects,  most  of  which  will  come  from  the  $1.2  billion  of  Federal  appropriations  to 
be provided to Amtrak. 2 None of those funds will be allocated to states, or to infra-
structure in locations where Amtrak does not presently operate. 
Corridor Services 

When  viewed  from  the  perspective  of  moving  passengers,  and  the  distance  they 
are moved (passenger-miles), Amtrak can be seen as providing two types of services: 
corridor  services  of  approximately  100–500  miles  and  frequently  under  contract  to 
states in which these corridors are located; and long-distance, primarily leisure trav-
el  services.  Within  the  category  of  corridor  services,  there  are  two  different  types: 
services  on  the  NE  corridor,  where  Amtrak  operates  on  its  own  infrastructure,  and 
services  on  other  state  corridors,  where  Amtrak  operates  on  infrastructure  owned 
and controlled by others. 

Corridor  services,  which  are  trips  of  five  hours  or  less,  have  seen  an  increase  in 
ridership  of  50  percent  over  the  last  ten  years.  Rail  corridor  service  of  three  hours 
or less is very competitive with air service on the same corridors. Approximately 20 

2 The total Federal capital grant for FY 2005 is $492 million, of which approximately one-third 
will  go  toward  fixed  facilities,  one  third  to  mechanical  (car  and  locomotive)  projects,  and  one 
third  to  debt  principal  repayment,  environmental  remediation,  information  systems,  and  other 
purposes.

million  people,  or  80  percent  of  all  Amtrak  riders  in  2004,  traveled  on  a  corridor 
service. 

The  NEC.  The  largest  portion  of  Amtrak  corridor  trips  are  on  the  Washington-
New York City-Boston Northeast Corridor. This is not surprising since this corridor 
has a long history of rail travel, a large and mobile population base, and significant 
public  investment  has  gone  into  the  infrastructure.  NEC  travel  accounts  for  almost 
half  of  all  the  people  who  travel  on  Amtrak.  If  one  looks  at  NEC  train  operations, 
separate  from  the  NEC  infrastructure,  this  is  the  one  area  where  Amtrak  operates 
at something close to a breakeven basis. 

Other Corridors.  In  addition  to  the  NEC  main  line,  Amtrak  operates  trains  for 

corridor service in fifteen other states.

As shown in the chart below, there are several corridors in which the train service 
has  been  able  to  attract  a  very  significant  share  of  intercity  passengers.  In  2004, 
a  total  of  approximately  8  million  people  (i.e.,  approximately  one-third  of  the  total 
Amtrak  ridership)  traveled  on  these  corridor  routes.  In  many  instances,  these  cor-
ridors are subsidized in part by states. State operating subsidies for these trains to-
taled  ten  percent  of  the  combined  Federal  and  State  funding  of  Amtrak.  However, 
States  have  not  borne  the  full  cost  of  these  routes,  and  some  states  that  have  cor-
ridor trains have not paid anything at all, thereby producing issues of equity among 
the  states,  as  well  as  market  uncertainties  about  how  travelers  value  the  services.

Long-Distance Services 

Contrary  to  the  trend  line  for  ridership  on  corridor  services,  extended  trips  have 
seen  declining  revenues  and  ridership—and  increasing  costs—over  the  last  ten 
years.  DOT  refers  to  these  services  as  Transcontinental  (more  than  one  night), 
Overnight  (one  night)  or  extended  corridor  (greater  than  500  miles,  but  with  no 
sleeping  accommodations).  Amtrak  presently  operates  15  such  trains. 3 Amtrak  has 
continued  to  lose  extended  trip  customers  to  an  airline  industry  that  is  offering  a 
low cost, high quality service, and to automobile drivers who choose to use the high-
ways  rather  than  rail.  Amtrak  has  had  little  or  no  success  responding  to  this  com-
petition.  As  Amtrak’s  presence  in  this  segment  of  the  intercity  transportation  mar-
ket  has  dwindled,  Federal  subsidies  per  passenger  have  continued  to  grow.  In  FY 
2004, the average passenger on a long-distance train received a subsidy of approxi-
mately  $214  per  trip  on  a  fully-allocated  basis, 4 up  from  $158  in  the  year  2000—
a  35  percent  increase  quintupling  the  modest  7  percent  inflation  over  the  same  pe-
riod. 

3 The long-distance routes are as follows: Vermonter, Silver Service, Cardinal, Empire Builder, 
Capitol Limited, California Zephyr, Southwest Chief, City of New Orleans, Texas Eagle, Sunset 
Limited,  Coast  Starlight,  Lake  Shore  Limited,  Crescent,  Pennsylvanian  and  Carolinian.  The 
Auto-Train,  a  specialized  service,  also  operates  over  a  long-distance  route  but  with  completely 
different  characteristics.  The  Three  Rivers  (New  York-Pittsburgh-Akron-Chicago)  was  discon-
tinued in March 2005. 

4 Fully allocated costs include depreciation and interest.

Overall, the picture of where things stand in intercity passenger rail service is far 

from what was hoped for when Amtrak was created in 1970. 
II. Recent History and the Call to Change 

During  the  1990s,  there  was  an  increasing  recognition  that  the  1970  model  of 
intercity passenger rail had developed some very serious problems. Congress sought 
to redress some of those in the 1997 Amtrak Reform Act. Unfortunately, the reforms 
embodied in the 1997 Act did not prove sufficient to solve the problems. 

Many of the reforms in the 1997 Act empowered Amtrak to improve its own per-
formance,  and  removed  impediments  to  its  doing  so.  After  passage  of  the  1997  Act, 
Amtrak’s then-management repeatedly reported that it was on a ‘‘glide path’’ to self-
sufficiency  by  2002.  That  did  not  happen.  The  problems  worsened,  and  it  became 
increasingly clear that they were not solely the result of business misjudgments, but 
also involved inherent flaws in the 1970 model. 

Instead of a successful ‘‘glide path,’’ Secretary Mineta was greeted with some un-
welcome surprises in his initial experiences with Amtrak during the current Admin-
istration. Early in 2001, instead of Amtrak being months from self-sufficiency as re-
ported,  Amtrak’s  then-management  advised  that  Amtrak  would  be  insolvent  within 
two weeks unless DOT subordinated the interest of U.S. taxpayers to a foreign bank 
so that Amtrak could mortgage its rights to use Pennsylvania Station in New York 
City.  Within  a  year,  Amtrak  had  lurched  to  yet  another  financial  crisis,  informing 
the Secretary that if the Department and Congress did not provide the company an-
other  $300  million,  it  would  be  insolvent  within  two  weeks  and  would  also  shut 
down  commuter  and  intercity  services.  In  response,  to  obtain  time  to  assess  and 
identify  more  long  term  reforms,  DOT  provided  Amtrak  a  $100  million  loan  under 
the  Railroad  Rehabilitation  and  Improvement  Financing  Program,  and  Congress 
provided the remaining $205 million through a supplemental appropriation. 

These crises highlighted fundamental problems, some of which needed immediate 
action by Amtrak, and some of which were revealed to be inherent to the 1970 busi-
ness  model  and  in  need  of  legislative  change.  Among  the  most  urgent  for  Amtrak 
itself  was  the  state  of  its  financial  books  and  records.  Indeed,  it  took  independent 
auditors  almost  all  of  FY  2002  to  close  their  audit  of  Amtrak’s  FY  2001  financial 
performance.  That  audit  required  $200  million  in  net  audit  adjustments  and  found 
5 material weaknesses and 12 reportable conditions that needed to be addressed to 
fix  the  problems  with  Amtrak’s  accounting  practices.  It  also  revealed  that  Amtrak 
had  taken  on  almost  $3  billion  in  new  debt  in  order  to  pay  for  (1)  costly  overruns 
of poorly managed capital improvements, (2) an unsuccessful foray into the express 
package business, and (3) day-to-day operational expenses. 

Since  2002,  Amtrak’s  record-keeping  has  improved.  In  2005,  the  independent 
audit  was  completed  in  March  instead  of  September  and  no  material  weaknesses 
were  found.  While  Amtrak’s  auditors  still  find  significant  areas  for  improvement, 
they comment favorably on developments over the last three years. 

Through  participation  on  the  Amtrak  Board,  and  through  changes  to  the  appro-
priations  process  that  enabled  stronger  FRA  oversight  of  the  grant  process  to  Am-
trak,  Secretary  Mineta  and  DOT  have  sought  a  variety  of  improvements  that  Am-
trak could make on its own. That process continues and is ongoing. Because I antici-
pate that the improvements instituted since David Gunn assumed leadership of Am-
trak will be covered in the testimony to be supplied by Amtrak itself, I will not de-
tail  them  here,  but  it  should  suffice  for  me  to  say  that  Amtrak  operates  in  a  more 
efficient and better way than it did three years ago. 

But notwithstanding the very significant management improvements and a much-
enhanced  and  valuable  involvement  of  the  Amtrak  Board,  fundamental  difficulties 
continue  to  confront  Amtrak,  because  the  1970  model  of  intercity  passenger  rail  is 
a  framework  that  is  flawed.  Amtrak  continues  to  spend  dramatically  more  money 
than  the  revenues  it  generates,  and  this  year  is  spending  at  a  pace  greater  than 
the  appropriation  from  Congress.  Amtrak  estimates  that  by  the  end  of  FY  2005  it 
will  have  only  $75  to  $100  million  of  cash  remaining,  with  its  costs  continuing  to 
far exceed its ticket sales. 

As  shown  by  the  two  charts  below,  the  structural  problem  in  Amtrak’s  condition 

is long-term, and is getting worse, not better.

Further  adding  to  Amtrak’s  deterioration  is  that  the  company’s  debt  increased 
massively  in  the  late  1990’s,  from  $1.7  billion  in  1997  to  $4.8  billion  in  2002,  with-
out adequately increased passenger revenues to pay the debt service. Because of this 
increased  debt,  Amtrak’s  repayment  requirements  (principal  and  interest)  are  fore-
casted to be approximately $273 million in FY 2005 (up from $111 million in 1997). 
The  FY  2005  appropriation  for  Amtrak  of  $1.2  billion  represents  a  134  percent 
increase  over  the  appropriation  for  FY  2001.  Amtrak’s  President  has  said  that  as 
presently  configured,  Amtrak  cannot  successfully  operate  through  FY  2006  without 
much larger amounts of taxpayer funds being allocated to this private company. In-
deed,  the  increase  sought  by  Amtrak—256  percent  above  the  2001  appropriation—
would  far  outstrip  the  22  percent  increase  in  domestic  discretionary  spending  over

the same time period. For the Federal taxpayers, that is a spiral in the wrong direc-
tion. 

Passenger rail is already by far the most heavily subsidized form of intercity pas-
senger  transportation.  When  viewed  on  a  per  passenger-mile  basis,  analysis  by  the 
Bureau  of  Transportation  Statistics  indicates  that  the  aggregate  Federal  expendi-
ture  for  intercity  passenger  rail  is  30  times  greater  than  for  commercial  aviation. 
Likewise, the intercity bus industry, where there are no comprehensive or dedicated 
Federal  operating  subsidies,  carries  as  many  as  350  million  passengers  annually 
(according  to  Eno  Foundation  estimates)—14  times  Amtrak’s  ridership.  So  contin-
ually increased operating subsidies is not the right answer. 

What is more clear now than ever is that the basic business model through which 
we  provide  intercity  passenger  rail  service  in  this  country—a  single  national  entity 
called  Amtrak—is  unworkable  and  is  not  adequately  positioned  to  respond  to  the 
changing  transportation  needs  of  this  country.  Massive  increases  in  funding  to 
merely slow a downward spiral are neither sustainable nor justifiable. At the same 
time, doing nothing at all will eventually result in a business failure and a lost op-
portunity for intercity passenger rail for this country. A change is needed. 
III.  The  Administration’s  Plan  for  Reform  and  Preservation  of  Intercity 

Passenger Rail 

As a matter of transportation policy, the Administration supports the availability 
of  intercity  passenger  rail,  but  with  a  very  different  vision  than  the  failed  model 
of  the  past.  Secretary  Mineta  has  repeatedly  set  out  the  fundamental  principles 
needed  to  reform  intercity  passenger  rail  and  place  this  form  of  transportation  on 
a sound footing. These principles are:

Establish  a  long-term  partnership  between  States  and  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  to  support  intercity  passenger  rail:  Partnerships  between  the  States 
and  the  Federal  Government  for  the  planning,  decision-making  and  capital  invest-
ment  in  transportation  have  been  one  valuable  element  in  the  success  of  Federal 
programs  for  highways  and  transit  to  date.  The  States,  through  their  multi-modal 
planning mechanisms, are in a much better position to determine their intercity mo-
bility  needs  and  which  form  of  investment  makes  the  most  sense  in  meeting  these 
needs  than  a  sole  supplier  company  in  Washington,  D.C.  State-supported  intercity 
passenger  rail  services  in  places  like  the  States  of  Washington,  North  Carolina, 
California,  and  Wisconsin  have  been  one  of  the  bright  spots  for  intercity  passenger 
rail  ridership.  The  Administration  wants  to  build  upon  these  successes  through  a 
new  program  of  Federal/State  capital  funding  partnerships  in  which  the  Federal 
Government would provide matching grants. 

Require  that  Amtrak  transition  to  a  pure  operating  company:  Amtrak 
today is both an operating company and the owner and maintainer of significant in-
frastructure  that  forms  a  key  component  of  the  intercity  and  commuter  transpor-
tation systems of eight states in the Northeast, as well as many stations and other 
facilities  that  have  local  or  regional  transportation  importance.  These  are  two  very 
different  functions.  By  having  them  both  reside  in  the  same  entity,  the  company  is 
faced with conflicting priorities, which the company has found difficult, if not impos-
sible, to balance. Infrastructure decisions have depended on Amtrak decisions, rath-
er  than  those  of  the  states  and  localities  who  are  largely  responsible  for  such  plan-
ning in other transportation modes such as highways, airports, and transit. Amtrak, 
and  the  nation’s  transportation  system,  would  be  better  off  with  Amtrak  able  to 
focus on one thing—operating trains—and doing it well. 

Create  a  system  driven  by  sound  economics:  One  of  the  flaws  of  the  1970 
model  is  that  intercity  passenger  rail  has  sometimes  been  defined  by  politics,  habit 
and  fear  of  change.  That  is  one  reason  that  some  routes  have  stunningly  high  sub-
sidies,  such  as  the  $466  per  passenger  subsidy  in  FY  2004  on  the  Los  Angeles  to 
Orlando  Sunset  Limited.  Intercity  passenger  rail  needs  to  serve  the  markets  where 
there is an identifiable demand that intercity passenger rail can meet. It cannot and 
should  not  try  to  serve  every  market  regardless  of  the  cost  and  regardless  of  the 
revenue.  Just  as  with  other  transportation  modes  and  other  successful  businesses 
in general, intercity passenger rail needs to have the dexterity to recognize changing 
business patterns and demand, and that sometimes the services of yesterday are not 
needed  or  justified  today  or  tomorrow.  Intercity  passenger  rail  service  needs  to  be 
designed  to  cost-effectively  meet  and  support  the  transportation  needs  of  the  trav-
eling public and sponsoring public authorities. 

Introduce  carefully  managed  competition  to  provide  higher  quality  rail 
services at reasonable prices: For the last 34 years under the 1970 model, inter-
city passenger rail service has not been subject to the discipline of the marketplace. 
On  corridor  services,  for  example,  states  do  not  have  any  alternative  but  to  have 
Amtrak  operate  the  intercity  service.  This  has  resulted  in  a  service  that  is  more

costly  than  one  would  expect  in  a  competitive  situation,  and  which  often  has  not 
been  responsive  to  changing  transportation  patterns,  demands  or  expectations.  In 
a  free  market  economy,  competition  leads  to  improved  cost  effectiveness,  higher 
quality  and  innovation,  elements  that  have  been  sorely  lacking  in  intercity  pas-
senger  rail  for  the  past  generation.  Transition  to  competition  is  never  easy,  but  it 
is necessary for the public to get the service it demands and deserves. 

Create  an  effective  public  partnership,  after  a  reasonable  transition,  to 
manage  the  capital  assets  of  the  Northeast  Corridor:  The  Washington-New 
York  City-Boston  Northeast  Corridor  main  line  is  the  most  heavily  utilized  rail 
route  in  the  country,  forming  an  essential  link  for  intercity  passenger  and  freight 
transportation  and  commuter  access  to  the  major  cities  of  the  Northeast.  By  some 
measures, such as the number of persons per day that use this infrastructure, Am-
trak is a minority user of this infrastructure—particularly in urban areas. Transpor-
tation  services  on  this  corridor  need  to  be  insulated  from  the  unpredictable  con-
sequences of Amtrak’s own finances and needs at any given time. At least initially, 
the  ownership  of  these  assets  should  be  in  the  public  sector,  and  management  and 
control  of  this  asset  should  reflect  significant  input  from  the  states  that  depend  on 
the Northeast Corridor for passenger and freight mobility.

Last  week  the  Administration’s  Passenger  Rail  Investment  Reform  Act  (PRIRA) 
was transmitted to the 109th Congress. It sets out and details the Administration’s 
proposals  on  specific  ways  to  achieve  these  objectives.  After  a  deliberate  transition 
period,  intercity  passenger  rail  would  become  an  economically  viable  and  strategi-
cally effective mode of transportation, supporting numerous successful rail corridors 
nationwide.  The  Federal  role  in  passenger  rail  would,  however,  be  revised  and 
strengthened  to  mirror  much  more  closely  the  current  Federal  program  supporting 
mass  transit.  As  set  out  in  Secretary  Mineta’s  transmittal  letter  accompanying 
PRIRA,  we  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Congress  to  discuss  and  fashion  the 
specifics  of  legislation  in  ways  that  will  successfully  reform  intercity  passenger  rail 
for the future. 

In  addition,  this  week  Amtrak’s  own  Board  of  Directors  and  its  Management  are 
releasing strategic initiatives crafted by Amtrak to begin the process of reform with-
in  the  company  itself.  That  is  a  timely  development,  with  many  positive  elements. 
Amtrak’s own recognition of the need for reform is a welcome response to Secretary 
Mineta’s  steadfast  resolve  to  address  the  problems  of  intercity  passenger  rail,  and 
create a viable future. It is encouraging that Amtrak’s own plan adopts many of the 
Administration’s  proposals,  though  it  lacks  some  provisions  and  our  legislation  will 
still  be  necessary.  It  is  critical  that  we  continue  to  pursue  all  avenues  for  reform, 
including legislation, if we are to avoid a collapse of Amtrak. 
Conclusion 

My  own  experience  with  Amtrak’s  Board  persuades  me  that  Amtrak  itself  recog-
nizes  the  necessity  for  reform  and  that  time  is  critical.  Without  reform,  Amtrak  is 
not  sustainable  at  its  current  level  of  funding  or  at  any  level  Amtrak  is  likely  to 
receive  in  these  difficult  budgetary  times.  Moreover,  history  tells  us  that  merely 
throwing  money  at  the  1970  model  of  intercity  passenger  rail  without  addressing 
the  problems  that  have  been  identified  in  the  subsequent  years  does  not  result  in 
any long-term improvements in Amtrak’s finances or quality of service. 

The  Administration  has  been  clear  that  it  cannot  support  the  failed  model  of  the 
past,  nor  support  putting  more  funding  into  that  failed  approach.  We  have  been 
equally  clear  that  IF  meaningful  reform  is  accomplished  and  implemented,  the  Ad-
ministration  would  support  funding  of  infrastructure  and  transition  needs  for  train 
operations and related costs. 

Secretary Mineta has repeatedly expressed the Administration’s support for inter-
city passenger rail service as an integral part of our overall national transportation 
system.  Congress,  the  Administration,  and  Amtrak  itself  have  a  brief  window  in 
which to adopt and implement meaningful reform. If this does not occur, discussions 
over reforming intercity passenger rail service will be taking place in a severe crisis 
situation in the not too distant future. In that unwelcome scenario, no options could 
be ruled out. The company faces a depleted cash balance, and a failed 1970 business 
model. It is for this reason that we urgently need Congress to address our legislative 
reform proposal this year. 

As you can see, there is much work ahead for all of us as Congress considers these 
issues.  Secretary  Mineta  and  his  team  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Congress 
to assess and implement long-term solutions to the recurrent crisis that plagues the 
old  model  of  intercity  passenger  rail.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  share  these 
observations  on  Amtrak  and  intercity  passenger  rail.  I  will  be  pleased  to  respond 
to any questions you may have.

STATEMENT OF DAVID M. LANEY, ESQ., CHAIRMAN OF THE 

BOARD, AMTRAK 

Mr.  LANEY.  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Lautenberg,  thank  you  for 
the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today.  My  name  is  David 
Laney,  I’m  Chairman  of  the  Amtrak  Board  of  Directors.  I  have  a 
prepared  statement  that  I  would  like  entered  into  the  record,  and 
I’m going to give a brief statement outlining the major elements of 
the  Strategic  Reform  Initiatives  Package  which  we’re  releasing 
today, and I believe each of you has a copy of. And, needless to say, 
joining  me—as  all  of  you  are  aware,  and  are  probably  familiar 
with—is David Gunn, sitting to my left. 

For  the  past  several  months,  the  Board  and  senior  management 
at  Amtrak  have  been  working  on  an  approach  to  reform  Amtrak, 
and  to  revitalize  rail  passenger  service  in  the  United  States.  The 
reform  initiatives  we  offer  you  today  are  the  results  of  our  efforts, 
drawing upon expertise in and outside of Amtrak, and on a consid-
erable  body  of  legislative  initiatives  and  reform  recommendations 
that has preceded our own planning. 

What  you  have  before  you  is  a  detailed  set  of  initiatives,  some 
of  which  Amtrak  can  do  on  its  own,  and  others  of  which  will  re-
quire government action. Taken together, we believe that Amtrak’s 
strategic  reform  initiatives  can  revitalize  intercity  passenger  rail 
transportation. 

Our  proposal  advances  four  essential  objectives:  First,  the  devel-
opment of passenger rail quarters based on an 80/20 Federal/State 
capital  match  program,  with  states  assuming  the  initiative  as  de-
velopers and purchasers of competitively bid corridor services. 

Second, return of the Northeast Corridor infrastructure to a state 
of  good  repair  and  operational  reliability,  with  all  users  gradually 
assuming  financial  responsibility  for  their  proportionate  share  of 
operating and capital needs. 

Third, continuation and possible addition and elimination of cer-
tain  national  long  distance  routes  that  meet  established  perform-
ance  thresholds,  with  a  phase-in  period  to  allow  for  performance 
improvement,  and  state  financial  contribution,  if  needed,  to  meet 
performance thresholds. 

Finally, fourth, the opening of markets for virtually all functions 
and services involved in intercity passenger rail to competition and 
private commercial participation. 

We’ve identified three sets of reform initiatives to achieve the ob-
jectives  that  I  just  mentioned.  They  include—in  general  terms—
structural,  operating  and  legislative  changes.  The  operating  initia-
tives identified in our plan highlight a range of actions intended to 
improve  the  performance  of  each  business  line,  in  order  to  provide 
better  service,  to  achieve  savings  and  to  enhance  revenues.  Our 
recommendations  for  changes  in  legislation  hinge  directly  on  cre-
ation of a Federal capital matching program, and they will help us 
establish  a  platform  for  open  competition  for  intercity  passenger 
services. 

The  lynchpin  of  this  plan  is  the  establishment  of  a  Federal  cap-
ital match attractive enough to attract increased state financial in-
volvement  in  existing  and  emerging  corridors.  Continued  develop-
ment of rail quarters is critical to the future of rail passenger serv-
ice in this country. And the pace of development will increase with

the  Federal  Government  as  a  reliable  financial  partner,  just  as  it 
has for decades with highways, transit and aviation. 

On  this  point  we  agree  with  the  Administration  and  every  other 
responsible proposal for passenger rail reform. The demand and the 
desire  to  do  so  exists  today,  ridership  on  corridor  trains  has  in-
creased over 22 percent in the last 5 years. However, to fully begin 
to realize the value of intercity passenger rail in addressing trans-
portation  challenges  will  require  positioning  it  on  comparable  foot-
ing  with  other  modes.  Only  then  will  states  begin  assuming  the 
lead, and only then will we begin to see the emergence of real com-
petition in the passenger rail industry. 

Returning  the  Northeast  Corridor’s  infrastructure  to  a  state  of 
good  repair  is  an  essential  part  of  our  reform  proposal.  In  com-
piling this plan, we studied various proposals and received and re-
viewed  models  that  other  countries  have  pursued,  for  separating 
the  maintenance  and  operations  of  busy  rail  corridors,  and  that 
concluded—for  now—that  the  complexities  and  risks  associated 
with such a segregation outweigh any benefits. 

Amtrak  owns  most  of  the  NEC,  it  is  the  only  end-to-end  user  of 
the corridor, and in terms of train miles operated, it is also the ma-
jority  user.  Amtrak  NEC  trains  operate  at  the  highest  speeds  in 
North America, and there are still segments of the NEC where we 
are the only entity operating trains. Our immediate challenge is to 
restore  the  infrastructure  to  a  state  of  good  repair,  which  we’re 
doing, and is detailed in our proposal. 

The  next  set  of  challenges  is  to  increase  capacity  for  all  users  of 
the corridor to address growing ridership demands. We believe that 
Amtrak  is  in  the  best  position  at  the  moment  to  oversee,  and  co-
ordinate  this  work.  Our  plan  outlines  a  number  of  short-term  and 
long-term initiatives to address these issues. 

Amtrak is committed to operating a national system of rail serv-
ice.  Rightly  or  wrongly,  long  distance  trains  have  become  a  focal 
point in the debate over reform of passenger rail service. While we 
believe their continued operation is amenable to the many commu-
nities they serve, they also present the basis for any future expan-
sion of rail quarters. We’re confident that we will reduce their oper-
ating  losses  through  a  series  of  steps  that  we  outline  in  our  pro-
posal.  We  will  not  eliminate,  however,  the  need  for  financial  sup-
port for long distance operations. 

Central  to  this  is  the  establishment  of  a  phased-in  performance 
improvement program that will couple cost-saving efficiencies with 
revenue-enhancement  initiatives,  so  that  over  time  these  trains 
will  achieve  financial  performance  thresholds,  or  be  discontinued. 
Our  proposal  outlines  a  series  of  specific  steps  that  we  would  take 
in evaluating our various long distance routes. 

The  first  job  is  to  set  fair  and  clear  performance  standards  for 
long distance trains, and establish a minimum performance thresh-
old. We would then rank each route so that we can determine early 
on  which  trains  meet  the  threshold  or  fall  short.  For  all  long  dis-
tance  trains,  we  will  work  aggressively  to  improve  their  perform-
ance so that they will more likely achieve the desired goal. During 
this process, we will be providing clear reports to the states reflect-

reasonable  effort  to  improve  the  performance,  and  close  the  oper-
ating  gap,  but  ultimately,  states  along  the  routes  will  be  required 
to  cover  any  recurring  gap  in  order  to  continue  train  service  on 
those routes. 

If  a  train  continues  to  fall  below  the  established  performance 
threshold,  then  we  will  notify  the  states  involved  and  begin  the 
process  of  discontinuing  the  service  on  that  route.  We  do  believe 
that  there  are  many  opportunities  for  competition  in  the  rail  pas-
senger  service  industry.  In  some  cases,  having  a  single  provider 
such  as  Amtrak  allows  for  economies  of  scale  and  certain  cost  effi-
ciencies,  but  we  can  assure  you  that  in  some  areas,  we  are  not—
and  never  will  be—the  most  efficient  provider  of  rail-related  serv-
ices. 

There are actions that Amtrak can do on its own, and others that 
will  depend  on  Federal  legislative  action.  Some  of  the  legislative 
decisions in this area will be difficult, and no doubt will encounter 
stiff resistance from a number of entrenched interests. Any discus-
sion  of  competition  will  involve  making  decisions  about  access 
rights  to  the  freight  rail  infrastructure,  tort  liability  limitations, 
and limited changes to certain labor, and labor/retirement laws. We 
have provided a discussion of each of these matters in our proposal. 
Also,  and  perhaps  most  important,  included  in  our  report  is  our 
funding  request  for  Fiscal  Year  2006.  Typically,  Congress  receives 
that  grant  request  from  us  in  February.  Since  we  were  well  into 
this  planning  exercise,  we  elected  to  hold  off  making  the  request 
until we had completed our work, which we have now done. 

The last dozen pages of the proposal details our Fiscal Year 2006 
budget  requirement,  which  is  $1.82  billion,  or  $1.645  billion  if  our 
working capital needs are covered by a short-term credit facility in-
stead of a grant. We think that’s the appropriate approach. 

Finally,  it’s  worth  emphasizing  that  Amtrak’s  Board  and  man-
agement have concluded that the company cannot continue to oper-
ate at Amtrak’s current funding level of $1.2 billion, significantly—
if at all—beyond Fiscal Year 2005. The negative financial impact—
which  we  still  haven’t  fully  quantified,  and  won’t  be  able  to  do  for 
some  time—of  the  recent  problems,  could  very  well  exhaust  our 
working  capital  and  leave  us  without  available  cash  by  fiscal  year 
end. 

We’ve  taken,  and  will  continue  to  take,  aggressive  steps  to 
achieve short-term savings, but we have very little maneuverability 
in  our  operating  budget  and  cannot  responsibly  make  material  re-
ductions in capital expenditures, which are critically tied to critical 
projects  on  the  Northeast  Corridor  infrastructure,  and  its  state  of 
good  repair.  Over  time,  significant  savings  will  be  achieved  only 
through an aggressive, continued and systematic multi-year transi-
tion process with legislative assistance. It’s for this reason that we 
have  brought  forward  our  Strategic  Reform  Initiatives  to  help  you 
in  your  decisionmaking  process  for  Fiscal  Year  2006  and  beyond. 
In  closing,  both  David  Gunn,  his  management  team,  my  fellow 
Board members and I, look forward to working closely and coopera-
tively  with  you  in  the  weeks  and  months  ahead  as  we  develop  our 
plan, and move this debate forward—hopefully to some conclusion. 
The  current  funding  model  of  unpredictable  annual  appropriations 
levels is unsustainable, there is absolutely a better way to do this.

We  have  no  choice  on  our  own  but  to  start,  but  we  will  ultimately 
need  your  support.  David  Gunn  and  I  look  forward  to  your  ques-
tions, and Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Laney follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID M. LANEY, ESQ., CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, 

AMTRAK 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to 
appear before you today. My name is David Laney, and I am Chairman of the Am-
trak Board of Directors. Joining me is David Gunn, the President and Chief Execu-
tive Officer of Amtrak. 

For  the  past  several  months,  the  Board  and  senior  management  at  Amtrak  have 
been working on an approach to reform Amtrak and revitalize rail passenger service 
in  the  United  States.  The  reform  initiatives  we  offer  you  today  are  the  results  of 
our  efforts,  drawing  upon  expertise  in  and  outside  of  Amtrak  and  on  the  consider-
able body of legislative initiatives and ‘‘reform’’ recommendations that has preceded 
our  own  planning.  It  is  by  no  means  the  final  word  on  this  discussion,  nor  does  it 
answer every question. However, we believe it does advance and inform the discus-
sion about what to do with Amtrak and what will need to be done to make rail pas-
senger  service  a  viable  and  vital  part  of  our  Nation’s  transportation  system.  What 
you  have  before  you  is  a  detailed  set  of  initiatives,  some  of  which  Amtrak  can  do 
on its own and others which will require government action. Taken together, we be-
lieve  that  Amtrak’s  Strategic  Reform  Initiatives  can  revitalize  intercity  rail  trans-
portation. 

Our proposal advances four essential objectives:

1. Development of passenger rail corridors based on an 80–20 Federal/State cap-
ital  matching  program,  with  states  assuming  the  initiative  as  the  developers 
and ‘‘purchasers’’ of competitively bid corridor services.
2. Return of the Northeast Corridor infrastructure to a state of good repair and 
operational reliability, with all users gradually assuming financial responsibility 
for their proportionate share of operating and capital needs.
3.  Continuation  and  possible  addition  and  elimination  of  certain  national  long-
distance  routes  that  meet  established  performance  thresholds,  with  a  phase-in 
period to allow for performance improvement and state financial contribution if 
needed to meet the performance thresholds.
4.  Finally,  the  opening  of  markets  for  virtually  all  functions  and  services  in-
volved in intercity passenger rail to competition and private commercial partici-
pation.

We  have  identified  three  sets  of  reform  initiatives  to  achieve  the  objectives  that 
I  just  mentioned.  They  include,  in  general  terms,  structural,  operating  and  legisla-
tive  changes.  Amtrak  has  already  made  substantial  progress  in  establishing  an  or-
ganizational  structure  and  creating  management  controls  which  have  resulted  in 
cost savings and better management; but we have considerable room for further im-
provement.  We  will,  of  course,  continue  to  implement  these  types  of  changes  and 
refine  those  already  in  place.  To  build  on  such  improvements,  this  plan  outlines  a 
new  focus  on  providing  planning,  budgeting,  accounting  and  reporting  of  financial 
activity  and  performance  along  our  distinct  business  lines—infrastructure  manage-
ment,  NEC  rail  operations,  state  corridor  operations  and  long-distance  operations. 
This  type  of  change  we  feel  will  improve  our  own  planning  and  performance  capa-
bilities, and enhance the financial clarity of our operations. 

Separately, operating initiatives identified in our plan highlight a range of actions 
intended to improve the performance of each business line in order to provide better 
service,  achieve  savings  and  enhance  revenues.  Our  recommendations  for  changes 
in  legislation  hinge  directly  on  creation  of  a  Federal  capital  matching  program. 
Other  recommendations  in  our  view,  if  implemented,  will  help  to  establish  a  plat-
form for open competition for intercity rail passenger services. 

The lynchpin of this plan is the establishment of a Federal matching program at-
tractive  enough  to  attract  increased  state  financial  involvement  in  existing  and 
emerging  corridors.  Continued  development  of  rail  corridors  is  critical  to  the  future 
of rail passenger service, and the pace of development will increase with the Federal 
Government  as  a  reliable  financial  partner,  just  as  it  has  been  for  decades  with 
highways, transit and aviation. On this point, we agree with the administration and 
every other responsible proposal for passenger rail ‘‘reform.’’ The demand and desire 
to  do  this  exists  today.  A  number  of  states  have  already  begun  developing  rail  cor-

ridors,  essentially  on  their  own  nickel.  They  have  recognized  the  need,  the  value  of 
passenger  rail  capacity  in  responding  to  increasing  congestion,  and  the  popularity 
of  rail  service  when  it  is  adequately  supported.  (Ridership  on  corridor  trains  has 
grown  22  percent  over  the  last  five  years.)  However,  to  fully  begin  to  realize  the 
value of intercity passenger rail in addressing transportation challenges will require 
positioning  it  on  comparable  footing  with  other  modes.  Only  then  will  states  begin 
assuming  the  lead,  and  only  then  will  we  begin  to  see  the  emergence  of  real  com-
petition in the industry. 

Returning  the  Northeast  Corridor’s  infrastructure  to  a  state-of-good  repair  is  an 
essential  part  of  our  ‘‘reform’’  proposal.  In  compiling  this  plan,  we  studied  various 
proposals and reviewed models that other countries have pursued for separating the 
maintenance  and  operations  of  busy  rail  corridors  and  have  concluded  for  now  that 
the complexities and risks associated with such a split outweigh any benefits. 

Amtrak owns most of the NEC, it is the only end-to-end user of the Corridor and, 
in  terms  of  train  miles  operated,  it  is  also  the  majority  user.  Amtrak  NEC  trains 
operate at the highest speeds in North America, and there are still segments of the 
NEC  where  we  are  the  only  entity  operating  trains.  Our  immediate  challenge  is  to 
restore  the  infrastructure  to  a  state  of  good  repair,  which  we  are  doing  and  is  de-
tailed in our proposal. The next set of challenges is to increase capacity for all users 
of  the  corridor  to  address  growing  ridership  demands.  We  believe  that  Amtrak  is 
in  the  best  position,  at  the  moment,  to  oversee  and  coordinate  this  work.  There  is 
very little disagreement about the importance of the NEC, both as a national trans-
portation  asset  and  its  economic  importance  to  the  region  it  serves.  While  the  Cor-
ridor  does  come  close  to  covering  its  operating  costs,  it  will  never  cover  its  capital 
needs.  Our  plan  outlines  a  number  of  short  term  and  long-term  initiatives  to  ad-
dress these issues. 

Amtrak  is  committed  to  operating  a  national  system  of  rail  service.  We  believe 
that  many  of  the  communities  served  by  long-distance  trains  lack  real  transpor-
tation  choices  and  rely  on  these  services.  Amtrak  operates  15  long-distance  trains 
and  for  more  than  half  of  the  states  we  serve,  they  are  the  only  Amtrak  service. 
Rightly or wrongly, long-distance trains have become a focal point in the debate over 
‘‘reform’’ of passenger rail service. While we believe their continued operation is in-
tegral  to  the  many  communities  they  serve,  they  also  represent  the  basis  for  any 
future expansion of rail corridors. It is important to note that we are confident that 
we  will  reduce  their  operating  losses  through  a  series  of  steps  that  we  outline  in 
our  proposal,  and  we  believe  those  reductions  will  be  substantial;  however,  we  will 
not eliminate the need for financial support for long-distance operations. Central to 
this is the establishment of a phased-in performance improvement program that will 
couple  cost-saving  efficiencies  with  revenue  enhancement  initiatives,  so  that  over 
time  these  trains  will  achieve  financial  performance  thresholds  or  be  discontinued. 
I understand how important the question of what we do with long-distance trains 
is to this debate. Our proposal outlines a series of specific steps that we would take 
in  evaluating  our  various  long-distance  services.  As  I  said  a  moment  ago,  the  first 
job is to set fair and clear performance standards for long-distance trains, and estab-
lish  a  minimum  performance  threshold.  Once  that  is  accomplished  we  would  rank 
each  route  so  that  we  can  determine  early  on  which  trains  meet  the  threshold  or 
fall  short.  For  all  long-distance  trains,  we  will  work  aggressively  to  improve  their 
performance so that they will more likely achieve the desired goal. During this proc-
ess,  we  will  be  providing  clear  remarks  to  the  states  reflecting  the  level  of  support 
each particular route will require in order to continue service on that route. As stat-
ed  earlier,  we  will  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  improve  the  performance  and 
close the operating ‘‘gap,’’ but ultimately states along the routes will be required to 
cover any recurring ‘‘gap’’ in order to continue train service on such routes. If a train 
continues  to  fall  below  the  established  performance  threshold,  then  we  will  notify 
the states involved and begin the process of discontinuing service on that route. 

We  do  believe  that  there  are  many  opportunities  for  competition  in  the  rail  pas-
senger service industry. It is true that in some cases, having a single provider such 
as  Amtrak  might  allow  for  economies  of  scale  and  certain  cost  efficiencies.  We  can 
assure  you,  however,  that  in  some  areas  we  are  not  the  most  efficient  provider  of 
rail-related  services.  A  key  goal  that  all  of  us  should  share  is  the  development  of 
a  vibrant  passenger  rail  service  with  a  competitive  supply  industry  and  multiple 
service  delivery  options.  This  does  not  exist  today.  In  this  regard,  there  are  actions 
that  Amtrak  can  do  on  its  own  and  others  that  will  depend  on  Federal  legislative 
action.  Some  of  the  legislative  decisions  in  this  area  will  be  difficult  and  will  no 
doubt encounter stiff resistance from a number of entrenched interests. Any discus-
sion  of  competition  will  involve  making  decisions  about  access  rights  to  the  freight 
rail infrastructure, tort liability limitations and limited changes to certain labor and

labor  retirement  laws.  We  have  provided  a  discussion  of  these  matters  in  our  pro-
posal.

Also  included  in  our  report  is  our  funding  request  for  FY06.  Typically,  Congress 
receives our grant request in February. Since we were well into this planning exer-
cise,  we  elected  to  hold  off  making  a  request  until  we  had  completed  our  work.  In 
so doing, we felt that we could give you a more comprehensive and accurate request 
for FY06 in the context of our reform package. The last dozen pages of the proposal 
details our FY06 budget requirement, which is $1.82 billion, or $1.645 billion if our 
working capital needs are covered by a short-term credit facility instead of a grant. 
We  have  also  included  a  preview  of  how  we  would  go  about  reporting  Amtrak’s  fi-
nancial information by business line. 

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that Amtrak’s Board and management have con-
cluded  that  the  company  cannot  continue  to  operate  at  Amtrak’s  current  funding 
level  of  $1.2  billion  significantly,  if  at  all,  beyond  FY05.  The  negative  financial  im-
pact  of  the  recent  Acela  problems  could  very  well  exhaust  our  working  capital  and 
leave us without available cash by fiscal year-end. We have taken and will continue 
to  take  aggressive  steps  to  achieve  short-term  savings,  but  we  have  very  little  ma-
neuverability in our operating budget and cannot responsibly make material reduc-
tions  in  capital  expenditures  (principally  tied  to  NEC  infrastructure,  and  its  state 
of  good  repair).  Over  time,  significant  savings  will  be  achieved  only  through  an  ag-
gressive and systematic, multi-year transition process with legislative assistance. It 
is  for  this  reason  that  we  have  brought  forward  our  Strategic  Reform  Initiatives  to 
help inform your decision-making for FY06 and beyond. 

In  closing,  both  David  Gunn,  his  management  team,  my  fellow  Board  members 
and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  in  the  weeks  and  months  ahead  as  we  de-
velop  our  plan  and  move  this  debate  forward.  In  many  ways,  the  relative  financial 
stability  the  company  has  achieved  in  the  last  two  years,  as  well  as  the  enormous 
amount  of  work  that  has  been  done  to  improve  our  infrastructure  and  operations, 
has  afforded  us  the  opportunity  to  develop  a  vision  for  Amtrak  and  intercity  rail 
passenger service. The current funding model of unpredictable annual appropriation 
levels  is  unsustainable.  There  is  a  better  way  to  do  this.  We  have  no  choice  but  to 
start  now,  but  we  will  need  your  support.  David  Gunn  and  I  look  forward  to  your 
questions.

Senator  LOTT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  now,  President 
David  Gunn,  thank  you  for  your  service  over  a  difficult  time,  and 
I think you’ve been the only salvation we’ve had, in some respects, 
at Amtrak, but I think you know we’re going to have to make some 
changes,  and  I  think  you’re  the  right  guy  to  try  to  help  us  decide 
what  they  are,  and  move  in  that  direction.  And  we’ll  be  glad  to 
hear your testimony. 

STATEMENT OF DAVID L. GUNN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 

AMTRAK 

Mr. GUNN. Thank you, Senator. I’ll keep my remarks very short, 
since  I  think  the  Chairman,  obviously  he  speaks  for  all  of  us,  but 
I think it’s important to congratulate the Chairman and the Board 
for what they’ve done in a very difficult process here. This has not 
been  an  easy  task,  to  come  up  with  a  reform  package,  and  I  think 
it’s a good plan that we’ve put forward, and I look forward to work-
ing with you to turn this into a reality. 

I’d  like  to  make  just  one  brief  comment  about  the  reform  pack-
age,  and  just  remind  you  that  it  really  is  a  package,  and  that  it’s 
interrelated,  so  one  has  to  be  careful  if  you  pick  and  choose  pieces 
out of it. Obviously the most important—I think—piece is the fund-
ing piece, for the state of good repair projects, and for working cap-
ital, and getting the states in a position where they can access Fed-
eral  capital  through  a  transit-style  program,  we’ll  say  on  an  80/20 
match. 

The proposals that we’ve made on the Railway Labor Act are de-
signed  to  overcome  some  real  difficulties  we  have  in  terms  of  pro-

ductivity,  and  they’ll  be  controversial,  but  what  we’re  asking  for  is 
to  be  treated  as  any  other  company  outside  the  railroad  industry 
would be treated. In terms of the moving toward, transitioning out 
of,  railroad  retirement  and  gradually  converting  to  social  security, 
it’s  important  for  costs,  it’s  also  important  if  you  want  to  open  up 
competition.  Since  railroad  retirement  is  a  rather  unique,  and  un-
fortunately,  a  very  troubled  system,  I  think  the  next  step  is  devel-
oping  a  realistic  implementation  plan  and  timetables,  once  we 
know where we’re headed on this reform journey. But I think that 
the  future  of  intercity  passenger  rail,  if  we  can  pull  this  off,  will 
be  much  brighter  than  it  has  been  for  years,  but  the  key  to  it  is 
to give the states the ability to be the purchaser of services and to 
access capital. 

Senator  LOTT.  I  was  still  meditating  on  that  last  comment,  I 
thought  you  had  more  to  say.  He  did,  he  pulled  the  train  up  to  a 
stop, the brakes are working fine. Mr. Mead? 

STATEMENT OF HON. KENNETH M. MEAD, INSPECTOR 

GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Mr.  MEAD.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  First,  you  had  a  hearing 
a  couple  of  weeks  ago  on  surface  safety,  I  wanted  to  compliment 
the Committee for having that hearing, and especially the majority/
minority  staffs  for  the  prompt  followup  to  it.  The  followup  was  of 
very  high  quality,  and  I  just  wanted  to  mention  that  before  we 
start talking about Amtrak here. 

Congress has provided direction in piecemeal fashion through ap-
propriations bills since the last authorization expired in 2002. And 
we’ve testified several times since then on Amtrak’s high debt load, 
unsustainably  large  operating  losses,  poor  on-time  performance, 
levels  of  deferred  infrastructure  and  fleet  investment.  And  each 
time I come up here, it seems that Amtrak is perpetually one, two 
or three steps from the edge of collapse, and I’m really encouraged 
by  your  words,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  Committee  plans  to  move 
on reauthorization in a timely way this session. 

So,  we’re  testifying  again  today  on  these  same  subjects,  but  I’ve 
got  to  say,  testifying  with  a  greater  sense  of  urgency  than  in  the 
past.  As  time  goes  on,  this  limp-along,  status  quo  system  that  we 
have comes closer and closer to a major failure. The problem is, no 
one  really  knows  where  or  when  such  a  failure  is  going  to  occur. 
We  reported  last  year  that  the  current  model  is  broken,  and 
there  seems  to  be  a  fair  amount  of  agreement  on  that  point.  But 
the reason it’s broken goes beyond just persistent budgetary short-
falls,  and  extends  to  matters  like  who  decides  on  the  type  and 
amount  of  service,  who  provides  the  service,  and  who  selects  the 
providers.  Right  now,  other  than  the  threat  of  budget  cuts,  there’s 
really  very  little  in  the  current  model  that  provides  incentives  for 
cost control. 

Mr. Chairman, Amtrak is quite literally coming to the end of its 
rope.  And  for  several  reasons,  the  bankruptcy  option  would  be  a 
complex  and  risky  undertaking,  and  in  our  opinion,  one  not  to  re-
lied  on  if  the  objective  is  to  promote  a  more  rational  and  reliable 
national  passenger  rail  system.  In  short,  a  comprehensive  reau-
thorization  that  provides  new  direction  and  adequate  funding  is 
needed, and it’s needed this year.

Now, what should this reauthorization contain? The reauthoriza-
tion,  in  our  opinion,  ought  to  focus  on  improving  mobility  in  short 
distance  corridors  around  the  country,  not  just  in  the  Northeast 
Corridor, and in restructuring long distance services to complement 
those  corridor  services.  That’s  going  to  require  new  relationships 
between  the  Federal  Government  and  the  states,  and  among  the 
states,  Amtrak  and  the  freight  railroads.  And  it’s  going  to  require 
giving  the  states  greater  authority  over  passenger  rail  decisions 
that immediately and directly affect them, and it isn’t going to hap-
pen overnight. 

But in order for this to work, a considerably more robust Federal 
funding  program  for  capital,  with  a  reasonable  state  match,  is 
going  to  be  required,  along  with  additional  state  contributions.  It’s 
going  to  cost  some  money.  The  Administration’s  proposal,  I  think, 
recognizes  well  that  the  current  model  is  broken,  and  it  confronts 
several  key  issues  in  a  straightforward  way,  while  leaving  others 
unanswered  or  unaddressed.  We  concur  with  the  emphasis  on  cor-
ridor  development,  within  and  outside  the  Northeast  Corridor. 
These  are  the  places  where  the  demand  is,  and  we  concur  as  well 
with the greater decision making powers given the states. 

Also,  we  think  the  authorization  ought  to  leave  open  the  door  to 
competition.  Amtrak  is  currently  the  sole  provider,  and  as  such  it 
has few incentives, other than the threat of funding cuts, to operate 
more  efficiently.  We’re  not  in  a  position  to  say,  though,  if  or  how 
many  competitors  are  going  to  step  up.  I’m  not  assuming  that 
there’s going to be a lot of competition, but I think we should leave 
the  door  open.  And  there  will  need  to  be  a  level  playing  field,  be-
cause  there  are  some  privileges  that  Amtrak  has  right  now  that 
others do not have. 

Consideration is also going to have to be given to the very legiti-
mate  interests  of  the  freight  railroads  who—it  so  happens,  outside 
the  Northeast  Corridor—own  the  rail  infrastructure.  Left  unan-
swered, though, by the Administration’s proposal, is a very central 
issue, most notably the amount of Federal funding it supports. This 
has  fostered,  in  our  judgment,  a  perception  that  while  the  states 
would be given more authority and responsibility under the Admin-
istration’s  proposal,  the  funding  burden  for  operating  losses  would 
fall  largely  on  them,  with  no  corresponding  commitment  to  signifi-
cantly  expanded  Federal  capital  funding.  We  think  the  debate  on 
reauthorization  would  be  much  better  informed  if  the  Administra-
tion  spelled  out  its  proposed  Federal  funding  levels  with  greater 
clarity. 

Now,  I  fully  recognize  that  there  are  problems  with  this  model 
that  go  well  beyond  money,  but  the  funding  levels  are  going  to  be 
an  integral  part  of  any  solution,  and  in  reaching  consensus,  par-
ticularly  if  we’re  going  to  ask  the  states  to  contribute  more  funds 
than  they’re  currently  providing.  Our  own  take  on  the  funding 
issue—this is the IG’s take, it’s not the Administration’s take, nec-
essarily—for 2005, the appropriation for Amtrak ended up at about 
$1.2  billion.  In  addition,  Amtrak  is  estimating  in  2005  that  it’s 
going  to  get  about  $140  million  from  states  for  operating  losses, 
and  another  $200  million  in  capital.  So,  that  puts  Amtrak,  effec-
tively, at $1.5 billion for their current system. That level of funding

is not sufficient to make progress toward achieving a state of good 
repair, in the Northeast Corridor or elsewhere. 

Now,  if  Amtrak  receives  $1.2  billion  again  next  year,  even  com-
bined  with  the  contributions  expected  for  2005—in  other  words, 
that they were just carried over to 2006—we think what’s going to 
happen is that Amtrak will, first of all, have to defer major capital 
projects they already have on the drawing board, and two, they will 
need to cut services, almost certainly in significant ways. I wouldn’t 
go so far as to say the railroad will stop operating, but you almost 
certainly  will  see  very  significant  cuts  in  service,  and  your  capital 
program will be right on the edge of a high risk. 

For  2006,  passenger  rail  is  going  to  need  Federal  funding  be-
tween $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion plus the existing state contribu-
tions, just in order to maintain the status quo as we know it today. 
That  level  of  funding,  the  $1.4  billion  to  $1.5  billion  level,  even 
with the state contributions, won’t be sufficient to move the system 
to a state of good repair, let alone permit the corridor development 
that we’re all talking about. 

And  I’m  focusing  on  2006  because  I’m  assuming  that  you  will 
pass  the  reauthorization,  but  you’re  not  going  to  effectively  transi-
tion  to  a  new  system  overnight,  so  I’m  trying  to  outline  for  the 
Committee  what’s  going  to  happen  in  2006.  Now,  for  2007  and  be-
yond,  Federal  funding  levels  between  $1.7  billion  and  $2  billion 
would put us on a road to bringing the existing infrastructure and 
fleet to a state of good repair, and better position states to use the 
Federal  funds,  plus  their  own  revenues,  to  invest  in  rail  corridors. 
Now what does that mean, about the states use their own funds? 
Now,  that  assumes  that  the  states  would  provide  a  reasonable 
match  of  between  15  and  30  percent  for  capital  grants.  That  com-
pares  with  what  we’ve  used  in  other  modes  of  transportation.  It  is 
different  from  what  the  Administration’s  proposing,  at  the  end  of 
the  reauthorization,  I  think  the  Administration  ends  up  at  50/50, 
I  think  that  a  more  reasonable  state  match  would  be  in  the  15  to 
30 percent area. And that would be for capital grants. 

It  also  assumes  that  the  states  would  cover  a  larger  portion  of 
operating  losses,  and  I’m  going  to  deal  with  that  in  a  minute,  be-
cause I don’t think it’s reasonable to just say, ‘‘Here, start covering 
all operating losses.’’ It also assumes that Amtrak’s going to imple-
ment  cost  saving  measures,  some  of  them  they  can  do  in  short 
order,  like  the  food  and  beverage  system,  which  is  probably  some-
where between $80 million and $90 million that could be saved. 

Now,  there  are  other  key  elements  of  the  reauthorization  pack-
age  that  I’d  like  to  outline  briefly  for  you,  that  extend  beyond  just 
a  level  and  mix  of  funding.  First  is  the  Northeast  Corridor.  Two 
points that I know about this corridor, you’ve got to bring this cor-
ridor to a state of good repair, and one reason why—look at the on-
time  performance,  the  on-time  performance  is  going  down,  down, 
down—and  the  other  problem  in  the  Northeast  Corridor  is  go-slow 
orders. The way they deal with this in rail is a little different than 
they  do  in  aviation.  Aviation,  when  you  have  a  problem  at  30,000 
feet,  you  can’t  say,  ‘‘Oh,  let’s  deal  with  this  problem  by  slowing 
down.’’ In rail, that’s one of the things they do, they put on go-slow 
orders.  And  that  affects  how  quickly  you  can  get  through  the 
Northeast  Corridor,  so  the  state  of  good  repair  is  very  important.

26

But  there’s  a  second  issue  with  this  Northeast  Corridor.  There 
are  some  proposals  that  would  separate  the  operator  of  the  North-
east  Corridor  from  the  infrastructure.  In  other  words,  the  infra-
structure would be handled by some separate business than the op-
erator. Great Britain has tried that. Now, we don’t feel—I’m speak-
ing  for  the  IG  now—we  don’t  feel  that  we  have  enough  experience 
in  this  country  to  say  you  ought  to  separate  the  two.  We  think 
that’s too risky right now, you need to know more, and I can’t rec-
ommend that step today. 

Debt:  Amtrak  has  about  $3.8  billion  in  long-term  debt.  We  can 
sit and argue about whether they should have accrued that or not, 
I  think  in  my  own  judgment  that  it  was  bad  judgment  to  borrow 
that much money—it created a picture, it made it look like Amtrak 
was really meeting the goals of the last reauthorization, but one of 
the  reasons  was  because  they  were  borrowing  all  this  money—so 
their  debt  really  increased.  Well,  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  the 
Federal Government, in annual appropriations, is paying that debt. 
We’re  actually  paying  this  debt  in  the  annual  subsidy.  And  we 
think  a  good  case  could  be  made  for  the  Federal  Government  not 
writing a check to Amtrak anymore to pay off this debt, but to just 
pay it off. 

One  reason  is,  remember  when  they  mortgaged  Penn  Station?  I 
think  you  probably  remember,  a  few  years  ago  they  mortgaged 
Penn  Station.  That’s  a  9.5  percent  loan  that  we’re  paying  off.  The 
U.S.  Treasury  can  borrow  the  money  cheaper  than  that,  so  since 
we’re  paying  it,  basically,  anyway,  we  think  a  good  case  could  be 
made that some consideration be given to discharging it. As far as 
future  borrowing,  their  ability  to  borrow  more  money  ought  to  be 
frozen,  unless  the  Secretary  of  Transportation  on  a  stack  of  Bibles 
certifies that would be OK. 

Long distance trains: Amtrak provides long-distance service in 41 
states. It so happens that in 23 states, long distance trains are the 
only  rail  service  in  the  states.  Of  the  23,  there’s  probably  five  or 
six  that  have  potential  for  corridor  development,  that  is,  between 
city  pairs.  But  that  leaves  about  16  states.  The  trains  incur  heavy 
losses, you’ve all heard about it, you know how controversial these 
long-distance trains are, and I’m not going to sit here and make up 
the policy, do a policy call on whether you should keep them or not, 
but  they  do  serve  a  transportation  need  for  people,  they  do  incur 
heavy  losses.  But,  I’ve  got  to  tell  the  Committee—as  unpopular  as 
it  is  to  say  this—getting  rid  of  all  your  long-distance  trains  is  not 
going to solve the funding problem. 

The math looks like this, Mr. Chairman. The operating losses are 
around  $600  million  a  year  from  the  long  distance  trains.  Get  rid 
of  them,  and  eventually  we  might  be  saving  $300  million.  So  you 
say,  what  happens  to  the  other  $300  million?  Well,  the  other  $300 
million  would  be  re-allocated,  probably,  to  facilities  that  our  long-
distance  trains  share  with  the  corridor  trains.  So,  it  wouldn’t  just 
be  a  case  of,  ‘‘OK,  let’s  stop  these  trains,  and  we’ll  save  $600  mil-
lion, like that.’’ In addition, there’s a thing called a C–2 payments, 
these  are  required  by  existing  labor  rules,  and  the  C–2  payments, 
in  2006,  would  actually  exceed  cost  savings.  It  would  actually  cost 
us  more  in  2006  if  we  were  to  stop  the  long-distance  trains.  So 
that’s the math.

27

Now,  what  about  the  states,  what  do  we  do  with  the  states  that 
don’t  have  any  potential  for  corridor  development,  and  have  these 
long-distance  trains?  Well,  one  thing  I  would  suggest  for  the  Sub-
committee’s  consideration  is  that  you  construct  a  formula  grant 
program—no  match  required—that  goes  to  the  states  who  don’t 
have  any  potential  for  corridor  development,  but  do  have  long-dis-
tance  trains,  to  cover  a  reasonable  percentage  of  the  losses  that 
they’re  now  incurring.  Rather  than  just  saying,  ‘‘You  should  pick 
that all up.’’ We have some ideas on how you might construct such 
a  formula,  but  I  do  think  the  needs  of  those  16  or  17  states  also 
need to be considered. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Mead follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. KENNETH M. MEAD, INSPECTOR GENERAL, 

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: 
We appreciate the opportunity to testify on reauthorization of intercity passenger 
rail  and  Amtrak.  Intercity  passenger  rail  is  an  important  component  of  a  balanced 
transportation system. Amtrak’s authorization expired in 2002. In the interim, Con-
gress has provided direction in piecemeal fashion in the appropriations process. We 
have  testified  several  times  since  then  on  Amtrak’s  unsustainably  large  operating 
losses,  poor  on-time  performance,  and  increasing  levels  of  deferred  infrastructure 
and  fleet  investment.  We  find  ourselves  testifying  again  today  on  these  same  sub-
jects,  but  with  greater  urgency.  As  time  goes  on,  the  current  limp-along  status  quo 
system  comes  closer  to  a  major  failure,  but  no  one  knows  where  or  when  such  a 
failure may occur. 

We reported in November 2004, that the current model for intercity passenger rail 
is  broken.  And  the  reason  it  is  broken  goes  beyond  persistent  budgetary  shortfalls 
and  extends  to  matters  like  who  decides  on  the  type  and  amount  of  service,  who 
provides  service,  and  who  selects  the  providers.  Other  than  budget  cuts  or  the 
threat  of  budget  cuts,  the  current  model  provides  few  incentives  for  cost  control  or 
delivery of services in a cost-effective way. 

Amtrak  is  quite  literally  coming  to  the  end  of  its  rope  and,  for  several  reasons, 
the bankruptcy option would be an extraordinarily complex and risky undertaking—
in our opinion, one not to be relied upon if the objective is to promote a more ration-
al  and  reliable  national  passenger  rail  system.  In  short,  a  comprehensive  reauthor-
ization that provides new direction and adequate funding is needed and needed this 
year. 

The  reauthorization,  in  our  opinion,  should  focus  on  improving  mobility  in  short 
distance  corridors  around  the  country—not  just  in  the  Northeast  Corridor—and  in 
restructuring  long-distance  services  to  complement  corridor  services.  This  will  re-
quire  new  relationships  or  partnerships  between  the  Federal  Government  and  the 
states and among the states, Amtrak, and the freight railroads, and give the states 
much  greater  authority  and  control  over  intercity  passenger  rail  decisions.  But,  in 
order for this to work, a considerably more robust Federal funding program for cap-
ital, with a reasonable state match, will be required along with additional state con-
tributions. 

The  Administration’s  proposal  recognizes  that  the  current  model  is  broken  and 
confronts  several  key  issues  in  a  straightforward  way,  while  leaving  others  less 
clear  or  unanswered.  We  concur  with  the  emphasis  on  corridor  development  within 
and  outside  the  Northeast  Corridor—these  are  the  places  where  the  demand  is—
and we concur as well with the greater decision-making powers given the states. 

Also,  reauthorization  should  leave  open  the  door  to  competition.  Amtrak  is  cur-
rently the sole provider of intercity passenger rail service and, as such, has few in-
centives,  other  than  the  threat  of  funding  cuts,  to  operate  more  efficiently.  While 
we are not in a position to say how many, if any, potential competitors there might 
be, there needs to be a level playing field to promote competition, and consideration 
must  be  given  as  well  to  the  legitimate  interests  of  the  freight  railroads  who  own 
the rail infrastructure outside the Northeast Corridor. 

Left  unanswered  by  the  Administration’s  proposal,  however,  is  a  central  issue, 
most  notably  the  approximate  level  of  funding  it  supports.  This  has  fostered  a  per-
ception that while the states would be given more authority, the funding burden for

28

operating  losses  would  fall  largely  on  them,  with  no  corresponding  commitment  to 
significantly  expand  Federal  capital  funding.  The  debate  on  reauthorization  would 
be much better informed if the Administration’s bill spelled out Federal funding lev-
els  with  greater  clarity.  We  fully  recognize  that  the  problems  of  the  current  model 
extend beyond matters of money, but funding levels are an integral part of any solu-
tion and in reaching consensus. 

Our own take on the funding issue is as follows. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 Amtrak 
received  a  Federal  appropriation  of  $1.2  billion.  In  addition,  Amtrak  anticipates 
$140  million  in  state  contributions  for  operating  costs  and  $200  million  for  capital 
projects.  In  effect,  Amtrak  had  access  to  funds  of  about  $1.45  million.  This  level  of 
funding  is  not  sufficient  to  make  progress  toward  achieving  a  state  of  good  repair. 
If Amtrak receives only $1.2 billion in Federal funding in FY 2006, even combined 
with  expected  state  operating  and  capital  contributions,  they  will  likely  continue  to 
defer  needed  capital  investment  and  may  need  to  cut  services.  Amtrak  needs  Fed-
eral  funding  between  $1.4  billion  and  $1.5  billion,  plus  existing  state  contributions, 
in order to maintain the status quo as we know it today. However, this level of fund-
ing  would  not  be  sufficient  to  move  the  system  to  a  state-of-good-repair,  let  alone 
permit investment in new corridor development. 

For 2007 and beyond, Federal funding levels between $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion 
would put us on the road to bringing the existing infrastructure and fleet to a state-
of-good-repair  and  better  position  states  to  use  Federal  funds  plus  their  own  reve-
nues to invest in rail corridors. This assumes that states would provide a reasonable 
match of 15 to 30 percent for capital grants and would cover a larger portion of op-
erating  subsidies  and  that  Amtrak  would  implement  cost  saving  measures  in  such 
areas as food and beverage service. 
Current  Model  Is  Broken,  Resulting  in  Severe  Financial  Instability  and

Declining Service Quality 

Despite multiple efforts over the years to change Amtrak’s structure and funding, 
we  have  a  system  that  limps  along,  never  in  a  state-of-good-repair,  awash  in  debt, 
and  perpetually  on  the  edge  of  collapse.  In  the  end,  Amtrak  has  been  tasked  to  be 
all  things  to  all  people,  but  the  model  under  which  it  operates  leaves  many 
unsatisfied. Consider the following:

• Amtrak is in a precarious financial condition. Its system continues to suffer op-
erating losses on all but a handful of routes. Losses on some longdistance trains 
(excluding  depreciation  and  interest)  exceed  $400  per  passenger.  For  the  last  6 
years  the  average  annual  cash  losses  have  exceeded  $600  million.  The  growth 
in cash losses since FY 2000 is primarily attributable to rising interest expense.
• Amtrak is carrying a large debt burden. Its total debt grew 178 percent between 
FY 1997 and FY 2002, although it has declined slightly in the past 2 years. For 
the  foreseeable  future,  Amtrak’s  annual  debt  service  payments  will  approach 
$300 million.

• While  ridership  increased  to  25.1  million  in  FY  2004,  passenger  revenues  were 
$1,304 million, below the $1,341 million achieved in 2002, due primarily to fare 
pressures.  For  the  first  5  months  of  FY  2005,  passenger  revenues  were  $3  mil-
lion lower than the same period in FY 2004.

• Amtrak has an estimated $5 billion backlog of state-of-good-repair investments, 
and  underinvestment  is  becoming  increasingly  visible  in  its  effects  on  service 
quality  and  reliability.  Deferred  capital  investment  has  led  to  several  system 
failures  in  recent  years,  including  a  failure  of  a  key  12-kilovolt  electric  cable 
during  the  August  2003  northeast  power  blackout;  fallen  overhead  power  lines 
(catenary)  on  the  line  between  New  York  and  New  Rochelle;  and  broken  bolts 
on the Thames River bridge in Connecticut. No one knows where or when a crit-
ical failure will occur, but continued deferral of needed investment increases the 
risk that it may not be too far away.

• Further,  on-time  performance  fell  from  74  percent  in  FY  2003  to  71  percent  in 
FY  2004,  with  even  Amtrak’s  premier  service—Acela  Express—achieving  on-
time  performance  of  only  74  percent.  On-time  performance  for  long-distance 
trains  averaged  less  than  50  percent.  Last  year,  the  poorest  performing  train, 
in  this  regard,  was  the  Sunset  Limited,  with  an  on-time  performance  of  only 
4 percent.

Today,  Amtrak’s  corridor  trains  outside  the  Northeast  Corridor,  based  on  current 
schedules,  average  48-mph  speeds  and  long-distance  trains  average  only  46-mph. 
These  speeds  reflect  scheduled  time  and  overstate  the  lower  actual  speeds  due  to 
delays.  Deteriorating  infrastructure  and  increasing  freight  and  commuter  rail  con-
gestion will continue to impact on-time performance.

Bankruptcy Is No Substitute for Reauthorization 

31

A rail bankruptcy is an extraordinarily complex and risky procedure, and we can-
not  predict  how  the  passenger  rail  system  would  emerge  from  bankruptcy.  An  Am-
trak  bankruptcy  is  no  substitute  for  reauthorization.  In  our  opinion,  this  is  not  an 
option  to  be  relied  upon  if  the  objective  is  to  promote  a  more  rational  and  reliable 
national passenger rail system. 

Labor  Costs.  Labor  negotiations  are  outside  the  bankruptcy  process.  In  a  non-
railroad  bankruptcy,  the  bankruptcy  court  can  cancel  or  change  collective  bar-
gaining agreements, which some airlines successfully used as leverage when renego-
tiating with their unions. In a rail bankruptcy, the Trustee would have to negotiate 
with Amtrak’s unions under the Railway Labor Act. 

Cash Crunch and Infrastructure Needs. Amtrak’s cash crunch would be exac-
erbated  in  bankruptcy.  Once  in  bankruptcy,  vendors  often  demand  cash  or  provide 
credit  under  stringent  terms.  As  a  result,  absent  a  Federal  cash  infusion,  there  is 
a  possibility  that  major  assets  such  as  Penn  Station  and  the  Northeast  Corridor 
would  need  to  be  sold  or  remortgaged  to  raise  cash  to  sustain  operations.  Mean-
while,  the  value  of  the  Federal  Government’s  mortgages  on  these  properties  would 
be diluted, and the infrastructure would continue to deteriorate. 

Public Interest. Once in bankruptcy, a federally appointed Trustee would direct 
and  manage  Amtrak.  The  trustee  must  consider  the  ‘‘public  interest,’’  which  has 
generally  been  broadly  interpreted  as  continued  operations  of  the  railroad,  but  in 
what  fashion  would  clearly  be  left  up  to  the  Trustee  and  it  might  not  be  the  best 
solution or a solution that the reauthorizers would prefer (or what the states would 
prefer). For example, in order to continue operations, the Trustee may need to shut 
down  various  state  corridors  or  long-distance  service  to  stop  the  bleeding  of  cash 
and operating losses. 
Eliminating Long-Distance Service Will Not Solve the Funding Problem 

Long-distance  service  has  sparked  widespread  controversy,  in  part,  because  of  its 
heavy  subsidies.  In  2004,  long-distance  trains  cumulatively  incurred  operating 
losses  of  more  than  $600  million  (excluding  interest  and  depreciation).  In  fact,  the 
loss per passenger exceeded $400 on two of these trains—Sunset Limited and South-
west  Chief.  Eliminating  long-distance  service  reduces  operating  losses  associated 
with  long-distance  trains  by  about  half  (or  $300  million)  but  will  not  make  Amtrak 
profitable. 

Because  long-distance  trains  share  stations  and  facilities  with  corridor  trains, 
eliminating  the  long-distance  trains  would  not  eliminate  the  shared  costs.  In  addi-
tion,  Amtrak  allocates  a  share  of  overhead  and  infrastructure  maintenance  to  the 
long-distance trains—some of these costs will be reallocated to all remaining trains. 
For  example,  we  estimate  that  $300  million  or  more  in  shared  and  system  costs 
would  be  shifted  to  other  corridor  trains.  Thus,  the  expected  net  savings  are  only 
about $300 million. However, these savings would not be immediate—in fact, in the 
first  year,  it  may  cost  Amtrak  more  to  eliminate  the  service  than  to  operate  it  be-
cause of its labor severance payouts (commonly called C–2). 

Long-distance  trains  represent  about  15  percent  of  total  intercity  rail  ridership. 
However,  many  of  long-distance  riders  do  not  really  travel  long  distances.  In  fact, 
long-distance trains carry only a small number of end-to-end riders. Of the 3.9 mil-
lion long-distance riders in FY 2004, only 527,000 rode the entire length of the route 
and another 403,000 rode between city pairs also served by existing corridor service. 
The  remaining  3  million  riders  traveled  along  portions  of  the  route.  These  trips 
mostly  ranged  from  500  miles  to  700  miles—slightly  longer  trip  lengths  than  cor-
ridor riders. 

While eliminating long-distance service may seem appealing from a Federal budg-
etary  standpoint,  especially  with  the  large  deficits,  it  ignores  the  mobility  needs  of 
rural areas of the country and the benefits passenger rail provides. Amtrak provides 
long-distance  service  in  41  states  and  is  the  only  intercity  passenger  rail  service  in 
23  of  those  states.  The  questions  of  whether  to  provide  long-distance  service,  who 
makes  those  decisions,  and  who  funds  the  losses  are  critical  policy  decisions  that 
will need to be made. 
Where Do We Go From Here? Reauthorization Guidance Is Essential 

The  ‘‘limp  along’’  approach  is  costly  and  leaves  many  unsatisfied.  The  current 
model  for  providing  intercity  passenger  service  does  not  leave  the  states  in  a  posi-
tion  to  decide  upon  the  best  mix  of  service  for  their  needs—what  cities  are  served, 
schedules and frequency of service, and service amenities. The model provides little 
balance between the national goals of an integrated network and regional and state 
transportation  needs.  How  much  funding  and  who  provides  the  funding—Federal, 
State,  or  a  combination—are  also  critical  questions  that  need  to  be  addressed.  In

providing reauthorization guidance, some core elements need to be considered in de-
termining how passenger rail is funded and delivered. Specifically, deciding the lev-
els  and  mix  of  Federal  and  State  funding,  achieving  a  state-of-good  repair  in  the 
Northeast  Corridor,  determining  the  appropriate  framework  to  integrate  competing 
demands of infrastructure and operations in the Northeast Corridor, and paying off 
Amtrak’s legacy debt. 

In  our  opinion,  a  new  model  for  intercity  passenger  rail  should  also  include  sev-
eral important aspects. The first is that funding and governance build in incentives 
for  cost  cutting.  Specifically,  eliminating  direct  subsidies  to  Amtrak,  or  any  other 
operator, and channeling funds through the states will likely promote more cost con-
trol  because  an  operator  will  need  to  better  justify  costs  in  order  to  retain  an  oper-
ating  contract.  In  addition,  it  will  encourage  states  to  maximize  efficiency  by  keep-
ing  their  own  costs  to  a  minimum.  Second,  the  introduction  of  private  competition 
into the management and operation of intercity passenger rail services will exert ad-
ditional market pressures on operators to provide cost-effective, higher quality serv-
ice. 
Adequate  Federal  and  State  Funding  Should  Be  Provided  in  Order  To
Restore the Intercity Passenger Rail System and Invest Meaningfully in 
Corridor Development 

Federal funding levels, along with state contributions, have not been sufficient to 
subsidize operations, address deferred capital needs, and significantly improve serv-
ice along the existing rail network. In the last 2 years, Amtrak has received annual 
Federal funding of $1.2 billion. These amounts were supplemented by operating and 
capital contributions from state and local sources—in FY 2004 these were $135 mil-
lion and $114 million, respectively. In effect, Amtrak received about $1.45 billion in 
public funds. 

It  will  require  at  least  $2  billion  in  funding  from  all  sources  to  begin  any  mean-
ingful corridor development. The policy challenge is determining who pays for what 
portions of the system. Federal funding of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion would not pro-
vide  sufficient  funding  to  maintain  a  5-year  program  toward  restoring  the  system 
to  a  state-of-good-repair.  Projects  in  both  the  Northeast  Corridor  and  in  the  cor-
ridors and long-distance routes outside the Northeast Corridor would continue to be 
deferred. This simply maintains the limp-along status quo. 

One  approach  to  promote  adequate  Federal  and  state  funding  could  be  to  use  a 
variety  of  grant  programs  similar  to  those  used  in  aviation,  transit,  and  highways 
that place funds in the hands of states. These programs are based on a combination 
of Federal/State matches and formula grants. More specifically, 

Capital Grants With a Reasonable Match. Like the Administration’s proposal, 
this approach would provide capital grants on a competitively determined basis and 
would be administered by the Department of Transportation (DOT). States that de-
sire  to  improve  existing  intercity  rail  service  and/or  develop  new  corridor  services 
would  apply  to  DOT  for  a  matching  grant,  similar  to  the  Federal  Transit  Adminis-
tration’s  New  Starts  Capital  Program.  The  Administration’s  proposal  also  suggests 
such a program but provides a 50/50 capital match rate by the end of the reauthor-
ization period. Our view is that a lower state match rate requirement would provide 
incentives  for  states  to  take  an  ‘‘ownership’’  role  in  developing  rail  corridors  on  a 
more competitive basis with other transportation modes (historically, highways and 
transit have used an 80/20 match rate). 

To  accommodate  the  need  for  different  types  of  capital  investments,  two  types  of 
capital  matches  could  be  established.  For  investments  that  qualify  as  traditional 
capital investment, such as track or purchases of passenger equipment, the Federal 
share could go up to 80 to 85 percent. On the other hand, for investments that qual-
ify as capital maintenance (for example, those under the transit definition) the Fed-
eral share might be 70 to 75 percent. 

Formula  Grants  With  No  Match  Required.  This  approach  provides  funds  to 
states outside the Northeast Corridor that do not have corridor development poten-
tial  and  that  rely  on  long-distance  trains  for  substantially  all  intercity  passenger 
rail  service.  By  discussing  this  approach,  we  are  not  taking  a  position  on  the  ulti-
mate  policy  of  whether  long-distance  service  should  be  retained  or  eliminated  but 
merely  presenting  it  as  an  approach  for  funding  states  that  do  not  have  the  popu-
lation densities to support corridor development. 

This  approach  could  initially  include  sufficient  funds  to  subsidize  existing  long-
distance and corridor services. Over the reauthorization period the funds associated 
with  corridor  services  would  be  reduced  and  then  eliminated  at  the  end  of  the  pe-
riod.  Further,  we  expect  the  level  of  Federal  funds  subsidizing  the  long-distance 
services would be reduced to reflect greater operating efficiencies resulting from cap-
ital  investments  as  well  as  other  savings  resulting  from  food  and  beverage  service

changes,  improved  labor  productivity,  and  efficiencies  that  may  be  introduced  by 
competitive service providers. 

As  determined  by  the  states,  funds  could  be  used  to  defray  the  cost  of  operating 
subsidies,  capital  investment,  or  both,  with  no  match  required.  The  amount  of  the 
formula  grant  could  be  calculated  on  the  basis  of  Amtrak’s  Fiscal  Year  2005  oper-
ating  loss  allocable  per  embarking/disembarking  passengers  in  the  affected  state  or 
some other formula that provides an equitable allocation. 

Restore  Northeast  Corridor  to  a  State-of-Good-Repair.  The  Northeast  Cor-
ridor  presents  a  difficult  challenge.  The  funding  priority  for  the  Northeast  Corridor 
reflects the accumulated deferral of investments which has resulted in an estimated 
$5  billion  backlog  of  capital  projects,  threatening  current  and  future  service  reli-
ability. The effects of the deteriorating infrastructure are readily evident. For exam-
ple,  Amtrak’s  reported  on-time  performance  in  the  Northeast  Corridor  as  a  whole 
between  1994  and  2002  ranged  from  82  to  89  percent.  In  FY  2003,  it  dropped  to 
about 80 percent. For FY 2004, even Amtrak’s premiere Acela service posted an on-
time performance of only 74 percent, far short of Amtrak’s stated goal of 94 percent. 
If  the  decision  were  made  to  keep  the  current  Northeast  Corridor  intact,  we  esti-
mate Amtrak would need to spend about $575 million annually for an extended pe-
riod  on  infrastructure  and  rolling  stock  to  eliminate  the  backlog  of  capital  invest-
ment in the Northeast Corridor. 

However, bringing the eight Northeast Corridor states and the District of Colum-
bia  together  in  a  short  period  of  time  to  direct  and  manage  this  effort  is  incredibly 
complex  but  may  be  achievable  by  the  end  of  the  reauthorization  period.  Recog-
nizing  this  challenge,  one  option  during  the  reauthorization  period  could  be  for  the 
Federal  Government  to  fully  fund  the  Northeast  Corridor’s  capital  requirements 
until  a  state-of-good-repair  is  achieved.  This  would  also  address  states’  reluctance 
to  inherit  a  legacy  system  they  did  not  create.  We  suggest  that  the  DOT  distribute 
funds directly to the Northeast Corridor infrastructure manager separately from the 
competitive grant process. 

Construct  for  5-Year  Reauthorization  Funding.  Congress  and  the  Adminis-
tration  have  a  difficult  decision  to  make  in  determining  the  appropriate  level  of 
funding  for  intercity  passenger  rail.  The  level  of  funding  can  obviously  vary.  We 
have been giving this some thought and would like to present a construct for consid-
eration.  We  recognize  that  many  assumptions  need  to  be  made  about  who  pays  for 
what  and  how  to  balance  national,  regional,  and  state  transportation  needs.  Those 
are decisions for Congress and the Administration to make. 

In  building  this  construct,  we  made  several  assumptions  for  purposes  of  illustra-

tion. These include:

• Formula grants will not fully cover train operating losses. Amtrak’s forecast net 
cash  operating  needs  (excluding  interest)  were  used  as  the  starting  point.  The 
levels  of  funding  represent  imputed  cost  savings  of  10  percent  per  year  from  a 
combination of revenue growth and operating cost savings.

• Over  the  5-year  reauthorization  period,  Federal  subsidies  decline  for  long-dis-
tance  trains  and  corridor  operating  subsidies  shift  to  the  states.  We  expect 
states  to  place  higher  performance  and  efficiency  demands  on  the  service  pro-
vider to lower operating costs to more affordable levels.

• Debt  service  is  based  on  Amtrak’s  projected  debt  service  payments  through  FY 
2009,  adjusted  for  installment  payments  on  their  RRIF  loan  and  possible  early 
buyout options on leased equipment.

• Capital  requirements  to  restore  the  system  to  a  state-of-good-repair  are  based 
on Amtrak’s Strategic Plan for FY 2005–FY 2009 and on assumptions we made 
on  allocating  capital  needs  between  the  Northeast  Corridor  and  the  rest  of  the 
system. The funding allocation assumes a capital need of $575 million for infra-
structure  and  fleet  in  the  Northeast  Corridor  and  $250  million  for  infrastruc-
ture and fleet outside the Northeast Corridor.

• Funds available for capital match represent funds remaining after state-of-good-

repair funding requirements are met.

NEC: Northeast Corridor 
New Federal capital available for state match does not become available until an-
nual  Federal  funding  levels  reach  $1.7  billion.  This  construct  highlights  the  policy 
choice that needs to be made between restoring the system to a state-of-good-repair 
and  investment  in  new  corridor  development.  At  $2  billion,  we  would  expect  about 
$500  million  to  be  available  to  states  to  match  for  use  in  new  and/or  improved  cor-
ridor  development,  and  after  a  state-of-good-repair  has  been  achieved  this  Federal 
funding level would provide over $1.3 billion for state capital matches. 
Too  Premature  to  Separate  Management  of  Northeast  Corridor  Infrastruc-

ture From Operations 

Proposals to separate the Northeast Corridor infrastructure management and op-
erations into two independent companies present a level of complexity and risk that 
needs  a  more  thorough  examination.  At  some  point  down  the  road,  this  split  might 
be  feasible  and  may  prove  a  better  way  of  controlling  costs.  However,  at  this  junc-
ture, not enough is known about the benefits and risks of this proposal. As we wit-
nessed  in  Great  Britain’s  experience,  there  are  risks  associated  with  establishing  a 
commercial,  for-profit  entity  to  operate  the  infrastructure.  Allowing  an  infrastruc-
ture company to operate ‘‘like a business’’ may mean relinquishing control over how 
certain  expenses  are  cut  or  which  capital  investments  are  made.  An  infrastructure 
company focused on its bottom line has incentives to make decisions that are in its 
financial best interest but may not be in the best interest from a safety or efficiency 
perspective  for  the  operator.  The  result  could  be,  at  best,  disruption  to  service  and 
a decline in on-time performance and, at worst, compromised safety conditions. 

Aside  from  the  risks  of  separating  the  infrastructure  from  operations  in  the 
Northeast  Corridor,  there  are  benefits  to  the  integration.  In  particular,  an  inte-
grated  Northeast  Corridor  provider  of  track  maintenance,  capital  programs,  oper-
ations,  and  dispatching  is  likely  to  be  more  efficient  and  less  costly  than  two  pro-
viders, each having a separate organizational support structure. In addition, a bifur-
cated  approach  would  require  a  fully  functional  oversight  and  control  organization 
at  the  outset  lodged  in  the  Northeast  Corridor  compact  or  the  DOT  to  coordinate 
between  operations  and  infrastructure.  If  formation  of  the  Northeast  Corridor  com-
pact is delayed, there could be disruptions to the operation of the corridor. 

It  may  be  possible  at  some  point  down  the  road  to  develop  a  model  where  all  in-
terests  are  best  served,  but  a  more  thorough  review  and  understanding  of  lessons 
learned  from  other  similar  attempts  would  be  a  valuable  precursor  to  such  a  divi-
sion in the Northeast Corridor. 
Pay Off Legacy Debt and Restrict Future Borrowings 

As  of  September  30,  2004,  Amtrak  had  long-term  debt  and  lease  obligations  of 
about  $3.8  billion  with  amortization  periods  extending  beyond  20  years.  Under  the 
current  model,  these  obligations  are  paid  for  with  Federal  appropriations.  Because

portions of Amtrak’s debt were financed at higher interest rates than what the Fed-
eral  Government  can  borrow,  Congress  and  the  Administration  should  consider  a 
one-time appropriation for the specific purpose of discharging any debt that can ben-
efit  from  the  Federal  Government’s  borrowing  power,  producing  longterm  Federal 
savings.  For  example,  Amtrak  pays  9.5  percent  interest  on  its  mortgage  obligation 
for  Penn  Station,  New  York,  whereas  recent  10-year  Treasury  notes  issued  by  the 
Federal Government are yielding a little over 4 percent. In addition, Amtrak’s abil-
ity to incur long-term debt should be restricted, except for refinancing opportunities 
that  lower  interest  expense  and  do  not  increase  the  outstanding  principal,  and  no 
commitments  should  be  made  without  advance  approval  by  the  Secretary  of  Trans-
portation. 

Mr.  Chairman,  that  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any 

questions at this time.

Senator  LOTT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Mead.  Senator  Snowe,  thank  you 
for coming, if you’ve got any questions you would like to submit for 
the  record,  and  your  statement  will  be  included  in  the  record. 
We’ve been joined by Senator Pryor and Senator Dorgan, also. 

Let  me,  I  don’t  want  to  take  up  all  the  time  asking  questions  of 
each  one  of  you,  but  I’ll  just  get  started  and  try  to  go  5  minutes 
or  so,  and  I’ll  yield  to  the  other  Senators,  and  then  we  can  get  a 
second round, but let me begin with you, Mr. Rosen. 

From  the  Administration’s  standpoint,  the  Administration’s  pro-
posal  calls  for  the  states  to  pick  up  50  percent  of  the  costs,  is  that 
right? 

Mr. ROSEN. On infrastructure matching grants, that’s correct. 
Senator  LOTT.  And  does  the  Administration  really  think  the 

states could or would do that? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  Senator,  right  now  there  are  a  number  of 
states  that  pick  up  100  percent  of  the  cost,  and  so  for,  at  least 
those  states,  it  would  certainly  be  advantageous.  For  other  states, 
they already put in something comparable to that when they want 
to  improve  transit  infrastructure,  so  I  think  it  is  likely  that  there 
would be states that would be interested. 

Senator LOTT. Is it true that the President’s budget proposal pro-

vided zero funds for Amtrak? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Yes,  with  the  caveat  that  there  was  funding  of  $360 
million  in  the  event  directive  service  was  needed  if  there  were  an 
Amtrak shutdown. 

Senator  LOTT.  Did  the  Administration  contemplate  the  serious-
ness  of  such  a  ridiculous  proposal?  I  mean,  what  in  heck?  What  if 
we  don’t  act?  Congress  is  not  a  swift  operation,  what  if  we  don’t 
do another authorization bill, what if we just balled up in the Sen-
ate  or  in  conference,  we  don’t  produce  an  authorization,  and  the 
Appropriations  Committee  says,  ‘‘Well,  sorry,  we  just  don’t  have 
the  money,’’  or  the  Administration  opposes  it,  I  guess  there  was 
some reason for that, but I frankly was extremely stunned and dis-
appointed  that  such  a  proposal  would  be  sent  up  here  by  this  Ad-
ministration. 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  Senator,  what  I  think  I  can  say  about  that  is 
that the course we were on, all of us on this panel has said in one 
fashion or another, that the course we are on is unsustainable, and 
so  Secretary  Mineta  has  made  plain  in  a  number  of  contexts  that 
the  point  of  the  President’s  budget  request  was  to  be  a  call  to  ac-
tion,  because  the  course  we’re  on  is  unsustainable.  I  think  it’s 
heartening  that  you’ve  scheduled  this  hearing  and  that  you’ve

made  the  very  hopeful  remarks  that  you  have  about  the  intention 
of this Committee and hopefully the Congress. 

Senator  LOTT.  Well,  obviously  with  my  record  and  all,  I  want  to 
work  with  the  Administration,  but  I  need  your  genuine  real  in-
volvement  and  help  to  get  this  done,  and  I  hope  the  Administra-
tion, the Transportation Department will remember that one of the 
critical  components  of  economic  development  in  America  is  the 
transportation  system.  If  we  don’t  have  well-funded  proposals  for 
highways  and  for  airways  and  for  railways  and  ports  and  harbors, 
we’re  not  going  to  be  able  to  grow  economically,  because  we  won’t 
have the capacity. And, quite frankly, I don’t think the Administra-
tion  is  stepping  up  adequately  to  the  transportation  area,  in  gen-
eral. Would you like to respond to that? 

Mr. ROSEN. I would, Senator. I think there are two aspects. One 
is  that  the  Administration  proposal  does  call  for  a  major  role  of 
both the Federal and State Governments in a partnership for infra-
structure  development  and  I  think  that  that  would  be  more  com-
parable  to  what  we  have  done  with  airports,  highways,  transit.  I 
think we do regard infrastructure development as an important un-
derpinning  of  economic  growth.  So,  I  think  there’s  an  area  of  con-
currence  there  that  transportation  infrastructure  is  an  important 
activity, and that’s why our proposal moves to a model that will en-
able that. 

tion. 

As to the question of—I’m sorry, I lost the other part of the ques-

Senator  LOTT.  That’s  all  right.  I’m  sure  you  were  a  little  sur-
prised at my reticence here, but I care a whole lot about the trans-
portation  area  in  general,  and  I  really  want  us  to  do  a  better  job 
of thinking about the future, and it’s more than just a budget item, 
it’s about our kids and our future, and I get excited about that. 

Mr. Mead, you and others, and again, I appreciate your thought-
fulness, but maybe it’s because I come from a truly poor state, but 
I  don’t  quite  understand—I  realize  maybe  Illinois  does  a  lot  on  its 
own,  in  some  states  they  do  100  percent—but  it  feels  to  me  like 
we’re  trying  to  say,  ‘‘Well,  we  can’t  figure  it  out,  so  we’re  going  to 
kick this ball over to you guys in the states.’’ This is a national rail 
passenger  system.  This  is  interstate  commerce,  we  have  interstate 
highways,  what  the  heck  are  we  doing  here?  States  can’t  come  up 
with 50 percent, in most instances. At the very most, like what you 
proposed, I think something where the states would come up with, 
I think you said 15 and 30, that’s what we do—I think—with high-
ways,  20  percent.  But  this  is  an  interstate  activity,  the  Federal 
Government  should  have  the  principal  lead  here,  and  not  try  to 
say,  ‘‘OK,  Mississippi,  Alabama,  Texas—figure  this  thing  out.’’ 
What are we supposed to do? 

Mr. MEAD. I concur mostly with that view. I do think that those 
three  states  that  you  named,  they  ought  to  have  a  major  decision-
making  role,  if  you’re  going  to  adopt  a  corridor  in  those  states  be-
tween  population  areas,  that  ought  to  be  a  call  that  a  state  can 
make,  and  the  states  need  a  robust  Federal  capital  contribution. 
The  comments  I  made,  I  think  a  lot  of  thought  has  gone  into  the 
Administration’s bill, but I was trying to point out in my comments 
about  the  funding,  that  funding—let’s  face  it—funding  is  a  key 
issue  in  the  problem  we’re  facing  here.  It’s  not  the  only  problem,

but  what  I  hear  in  my  travels  is  the  states  saying,  ‘‘Well,  this  is 
all very nice, that we get this decisionmaking power, and more re-
sponsibility,  but  what’s  in  this  bag  that  you’re  giving  us?’’  And 
that’s  why  I  would  urge  that  the  Administration  reflect  on  what 
they’re willing to support in the way of Federal funding. 

Senator  LOTT.  Mr.  Gunn,  I  do  think  we’ve  really  got  to  find  a 
way to fund Amtrak adequately or give you access to some reliable, 
steady  stream  of  money,  or  give  it  up.  But  we  can’t,  if  we’re  going 
to continue to appropriate money or provide you some other oppor-
tunity,  like  bond  authority,  we  also  have  to  expect  you  to  make 
some  tough  decisions  that  involve  management  and  labor,  you’re 
going  to  have  to  take  some  actions  to  save  money,  we’ve  got  to 
make  sure,  we’ve  got  to  be  diligent  in  making  sure  that  people’s 
money  is  spent  well.  I  realize  that  a  route  that  affects  my  state 
could be eliminated, I do think we’ll have to belly up to the bar and 
recognize  some  of  these  long  distance  routes  are  just  not  going  to 
make  it.  So,  that  is  the  other  side  of  the  equation.  And  I  assume 
that  your  proposal  that  you’re  offering  here  today,  the  initiatives, 
I  believe  the  Chairman  did  point  out  that  you  are  calling  for  some 
belt-tightening and some changes in the way you conduct business. 
Would you like to respond to that? 

Mr. GUNN. From the management’s point of view, what we want 
to  try  to  do  is  to  reduce  the  deficits  as  much  as  possible  on  these 
trains, and there are a number of proposals that are detailed in the 
reform package as to the types of things that we’re going to do that 
we  think  will  improve  productivity.  We  obviously  want  to,  I  men-
tioned  the  Railway  Labor  Act  and  the  need  to  properly  size  train 
crews  and  to  restructure  our  maintenance  functions  from  a  craft 
basis  to  an  industrial  basis.  These  are  all  things  that  we’re  fully 
prepared to try to undertake, and that we will undertake to the ex-
tent  that  we  have  the  authority  to  do  it,  but  I  would  just  caution 
you  that—and  I  think  the  DOT  Inspector  General  talked  about 
this—there’s not a lot of savings eliminating a single train, because 
what  happens  is,  you  have  to  take  out  large  swathes  of  service  to 
get  at  the  overhead,  or  the  shared  costs  of  these  routes.  But,  we 
have  already  taken  off,  I  think  it’s  three  or  four  trains  since  I’ve 
been here, we did the Three Rivers just recently, we truncated the 
Palmetto, we took off the Kentucky Cardinal, a series of trains that 
we’ve removed, so we think that there should be standards applied 
to these trains, and we’d like the opportunity to make them as effi-
cient  as  possible.  Because  we  have  actually  made  progress  in  the 
deficit per train mile, so we think, we can’t make money with these 
trains,  but  we  can  make  them  better,  and  that  makes  the  political 
decision a lot easier, because you don’t have as much funding to go 
into it. But we support—your point of view is supported. 

Senator  LOTT.  We’ll  have  another  round,  I’ll  come  back  to  you, 

Mr. Laney. Senator Lautenberg? 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, in answer 
to your question about what happens if the budget goes through as 
the  President’s  proposed  it  for  Amtrak,  you  asked  what  would  be 
the  outcomes—there  would  be  very  long  waits  at  the  platforms,  I 
can  tell  you  that,  and  it’s  just  outrageous  when  you  think  about 
that  25  million  people  used  Amtrak  last  year.  Twenty  five  million 
people. And everybody knows that we have something called essen-

tial  air  service,  but  there  are  places  where  we  had  essential  train 
service,  because  it’s  the  only  mode  for  lots  of  people,  as  Mr.  Mead 
suggested. 

Mr. Rosen, the President essentially proposed zero for Amtrak in 
his  budget,  and  now  the  Administration  plan  says  such  sums  as 
may be necessary. So, does the Administration feel that zero is nec-
essary for Fiscal Year 2006? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  Senator,  you’re  talking  about  two  different 
models.  The  Administration  budget  calls  for  zero  under  the  old 
1971  model  of  Amtrak,  the  ‘‘such  sums  as  necessary’’  is  in  the  Ad-
ministration  proposal  for  a  new  approach  to  intercity  passenger 
rail. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. And the new approach invites competition 
and  we  talked  about  Amtrak’s  bottom  line  being  so  disastrous.  So, 
will  we  have  a  rush  of  competitors  come  in  there  and  take  over 
these lines that don’t make any money? 

Mr. ROSEN. Well, Senator, the Administration proposal envisions 
a  6-year  transition  period,  during  which  time,  financial  bench-
marks  would  be  applied  to  the  trains,  the  State/Federal  partner-
ship would be established, the opportunity for states to participate 
in  the  planning  of  rail,  the  way  they  do  for  other  transportation 
would be established, and in that period, as we move from a single 
national provider, Amtrak, to a decentralized system, where states 
have  a  major  role  in  the  transportation  planning  process,  and 
where  competition  was  enabled  by  leveling  the  playing  field  on 
some  of  the  items,  I  think  we  believe  that  there  will  be  companies 
that  would  be  interested  in  competing  to  be  train  operators.  We 
have  other  people  that  are  train  operators  in  commuter  rail,  we 
know that there are people, other people that know how to operate 
trains, how many of them? Will they rush? The question when you 
transition  to  competition  is  that  markets  are  dynamic,  you  can’t 
fully——

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Rosen,  thank  you  very  much  for  the 

extended answer. 

Mr. Gunn, what do you think about competitors coming in there, 
anxious to take over, and by the way, they’d have to maintain some 
reasonable  degree  of  cost,  because  there’s  no  way  to  drive  people 
away  from  transportation  opportunities  than  high  costs,  but  what 
do  you  think  about  the  possibility  of  competition  coming  in  here 
and doing it better, especially coming from the private side? 

Mr.  GUNN.  Well,  I  think,  if  you  look  at  the  Board’s  reform  pro-
posal,  and  this  is  sort  of  awkward  because  Mr.  Rosen  is  on  our 
Board,  but  he’s  also  speaking  for  the  Secretary,  but  our  proposal, 
it  says  that  if  you  want  competition,  you  need  to  level  the  playing 
field,  and  it’s  not  clear  how  many  people  will  show  up  to  be  full 
service operators, but to do that, you need to level the playing field. 
There  are  people  out  there,  but  you’d  have  to  change  some  of  the 
ground rules for how we operate, you’d have to deal with the access 
to the freight railroads. 

I  personally  think  competition,  you  should  also  look  at  competi-
tion  in  a  different  way,  as  well,  and  I’m  not  against  what  you’re 
talking  about,  but  I  think  that  the  easiest  way  to  get  competition 
going  is  providing  services.  Whether  it’s  food  service,  whether  it’s 
selling  tickets,  whether  it’s  certain  maintenance  services—we  al-

ready contract out, and use contracting a lot to try to control costs. 
But,  I  think  if  you  want  to  have  full-service  operators  show  up  on 
interstate  services,  you’re  going  to  have  to  make  some  changes  in 
the  rules,  which  is,  I  think  the  Board’s  reform  package—and  the 
Chairman  mentioned  that  in  his  testimony—that  the  goal,  you 
have  to  level  the  playing  field.  Because  we  have  an  advantage, 
right now. We have an advantage on the insurance, the liability in-
surance,  we  have  an  advantage  on  access  to  the  freight  railroads, 
we  have  the  advantage  of  having  size  on  our  side,  the  economies 
of  scale,  so  this  is  not  something  you  want  to  do  casually.  I’m  not 
against it, but I think if you’re going to have other operators show 
up,  it’s  important  that  you  have,  it  be  very  well  thought  out.  They 
won’t appear out of the ether to run the Southwest cheap. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Do  we  have  examples  of  countries  where, 
I’m  talking  about  the  more  advanced,  the  more  developed  coun-
tries,  where  they’ve  had  private  operators  come  in  and  do  it  suc-
cessfully, and do it within budgets and good quality of service? 

Mr.  GUNN.  Well,  probably  the  poster  child,  or  boy  for  this  type 
of organization is Britain. Now, where they’ve set up private—they 
broke  their  railroads,  they  destroyed  vertical  integration,  and  they 
set  up  a  separate  infrastructure  company,  separate  rolling  stock 
company, and separate operating companies. And they actually had 
a lot of private companies that have shown up to do it, because the 
amount  of  subsidy  has  just  skyrocketed.  There’s  a  lot  of  money  to 
be  made,  if  you  continue  to  subsidize  it.  And  that’s  what’s  hap-
pened. The quality of service has not improved. The cost of service 
has  deteriorated,  and  they’ve  lost  a  lot  of  the  control  they  used  to 
have when it was a unified——

Senator LAUTENBERG. The quality of the service also has deterio-

rated. 

Mr. GUNN. Yes, it has. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Is safety on the British—? 
Mr. GUNN. I don’t have the entire history of the British railways, 
but  they’ve  certainly  have  had  some  unfortunate  incidences  that 
came  about.  I  think  it’s  more  of  a  factor,  rather  than  privatization 
versus government, it’s the function of destroying the vertical inte-
gration.  I  mean,  I  think  it’s,  you  can  have  a  private  company,  or 
you can have a quasi-government operation like Amtrak, as long as 
it’s vertically integrated, you can get a pretty efficient operation. If 
you destroy that, I think you really, it will be very expensive. And 
that’s  what’s  happened  to  Britain.  I  mean,  they’re  now  spending 
like $12 billion a year subsidizing their rail system, up from about 
two. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. So, that’s a highly undesirable competitive 

position. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator  LOTT.  Thank  you,  Senator  Lautenberg.  Let’s  see  here, 

Senator Pryor. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator  PRYOR.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  thank  you  for 
your  leadership  and  attention  to  this,  along  with  Senator  Lauten-
berg,  and  certainly  Senator  Inouye.  I’d  like  to,  if  I  could,  with  the 
panel’s attention, focus your attention on long distance service. Ar-

kansas  has  a  long  distance  line  called  the  Texas  Eagle,  approxi-
mately 20,000 people ride it each year, services mostly rural towns, 
also stops in Little Rock, kind of cuts right through the state, pret-
ty  much  northeast  through  southwest.  And,  a  lot  of  people  enjoy 
that service, certainly we don’t have nearly the ridership, say, like 
New  Jersey  or  some  of  the  more  densely  populated  states,  but  we 
just  don’t  have  that  population  density,  so  I  understand  the  chal-
lenge that you all have. 

I  think  I’d  like  to  focus  on  two  things.  One  is  this  idea  of  state 
funding,  Mr.  Rosen,  you  were  talking  about  that  a  few  moments 
ago,  and  others  have  as  well,  and  also  this  concept  of  evaluating, 
somehow  coming  up  with  an  evaluation  of  long  distance  service, 
and  you  all  have  referred  to  that  as  well.  So,  Mr.  Rosen,  let  me 
start  with  you,  if  I  can.  You  talked  about  a  50/50  matching  on  in-
frastructure grants, where the states would match 50 percent. The 
first  question  I  have  is,  let’s  say  that,  again  with  the  Texas  Eagle, 
let’s  just  say  it  goes  through  four  or  five  states,  and  one  of  those 
states  is  Arkansas  and  let’s  just  say,  not  to  pick  on  anybody,  but 
the State of Missouri decides they’re not going to pay, but the other 
four states do, how will that work? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  the  way  we  envision  it  working  is  that  the 
states  would  have  to  find  a  mechanism  to  talk  to  one  another,  a 
bill  enables,  as  actually  the  1997  Reform  Act,  states  to  form  com-
pacts  with  one  another,  and  they  could  agree  on  their  own  ground 
rules  on  that,  which  is  to  say  that  if  somebody  doesn’t  participate, 
what happens next? Do others have to kick in, what happens to the 
service?  But  the  precise  mechanism  depends,  to  a  great  extent,  on 
what the states decided to do about that. 

Senator  PRYOR.  So,  in  other  words,  you’d  leave  it  up  to  the 
states,  and  I  can  just  see  the  issues  boiling  up  on  that  already 
about what factors do you consider for each state’s contribution, do 
you  consider  the  number  of  miles  in  the  state,  which  certainly  is 
something that we can understand, the number of passengers that 
utilize  the  service,  the  number  of  stops  that  are  made,  I  mean,  I 
can see a big fight there, but as I understand it, what you’re saying 
is,  that’s  not  Amtrak’s  headache?  You  think  the  states  need  to  re-
solve that? 

Mr. ROSEN. Yes, sir, that’s right, in essence, the purchasers, and 
in  this  instance  the  states  would  be  functioning  as  proxies  for  the 
consumers,  they  would  have  to  develop  a  mechanism  to  resolve 
that.  Now,  as  is,  I  think,  always  the  case,  we  at  the  Department 
of  Transportation  would  assist  and  enable,  and  if  necessary,  per-
haps  we  could  participate  in  regulations  or  guidelines  or  other 
mechanisms gained from best practices and experience, but I think 
in  the  first  instance,  we  would  look  to  the  states  to  work  that  out. 
Senator PRYOR. Mr. Laney, do you or others on the panel, do you 
all  have  any  comments  on  that,  and  how  we  should  resolve  this? 
Mr.  LANEY.  Senator,  let  me  add  to  what  Mr.  Rosen’s  comments 
were.  First  of  all,  the  entire  process,  start  to  finish,  has  not  been 
fully  designed,  but  we  all  are  of  the  mind  that  the  process  does 
need  to  be  clear,  in  terms  of  understanding,  and  ultimately  evalu-
ating and then ranking trains. What you heard from Mr. Mead was 
an  interesting  proposal,  and  it’s  an  interesting  comment,  the  fact 
that in about half—it’s not exactly half—in about half of the states

that we provide service, the only service we provide is long distance 
service. And, if there is a concentrated investment in a combination 
of  Northeast  Corridor  and  other  corridor  services  throughout  the 
states,  whether  it’s  matched  at  whatever  level,  states  like  yours, 
and  a  number  of  other  states,  are  going  to  say,  ‘‘What’s  in  it  for 
us?’’

The  evaluation  process,  the  establishing  a  threshold,  the  decid-
ing,  ultimately,  what  trains—if  they  are  not,  if  there’s  a  gap  in 
terms  of  operating  deficit,  if  it’s  not  close,  and  then  not  supported 
by the states—the question becomes, is there still a continued role 
for the Federal Government. And I think Mr. Mead was suggesting 
that  there  is.  So,  there  may  be  a  balance  between  pure  state  cov-
erage,  and  a  combined  Federal/State  coverage  that  still  fits  into 
that construct. 

Mr.  MEAD.  I’d  like  to  just  add  to  that,  I  think  there  are  two 
issues that are implicit in the question that you pose. The first one 
is  the  service  you  have  now.  What  I  was  suggesting  was  that  at 
least  for  the  period  of  the  reauthorization,  that  your  state,  along 
with  the  other  states  that  have  this  long  distance  service,  you 
would  get  a  formula  grant—I  haven’t  exactly  figured  out  how  it 
would be calculated—but it would be for the purpose of paying the 
operator  a  percentage  of  the  operating  loss.  And  it  would  be  no 
match  required.  Because  I  feel  that  you  have  to,  the  states  that 
don’t  have  corridor  development  potential,  that  they’re  still  states, 
and they still have transportation needs in the rail area. 

Then  the  second  part  of  the  question  you  posed,  I  think  has  to 
do  with  capital  development.  Maybe  an  analogy  isn’t  apt,  but  I 
think of Chicago O’Hare Airport. Chicago O’Hare Airport would not 
be  expanded  unilaterally  because  the  Federal  Government  decided 
that  there  should  be  an  expansion  program  at  Chicago  O’Hare. 
That is directly and immediately a decision for the State of Illinois. 
Then the Federal Government has to provide some capital, to assist 
in the development of that. And I guess what I’m trying to say is—
and  I  think  all  of  us  are  to  one  degree  or  another—that  you  also 
need  a  capital  program  to  make  things  better  than  they  are  now, 
and that is the one where the match issue comes into play. The Ad-
ministration’s proposal right now is for a 50 percent match. I think 
you  need  a  more  reasonable  one  of  somewhere  between  15  and  30 
percent,  that’s  more  compatible  with  what  we’ve  done  in  aviation, 
highways, transit, for new projects. 

Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator LOTT. Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  very  much.  I  think 
that  the  responsibility  for  part  of  the  mess  that  we  have  here  is 
a responsibility that goes to the doorstep of the Administration and 
the  Congress.  I  mean,  think  about  this  just  a  little  bit,  and  the 
message that we’ve been moving around here in recent years, start 
it  up,  shut  it  down,  slow  it  down,  keep  it  open,  get  rid  of  long  dis-
tance trains, bring in competitors, and by the way, don’t adequately 
fund capital investment or infrastructure, and also run it as a busi-
ness. I mean, what a terrible way to run a railroad, what on earth

are  we  thinking  about?  I’ve  always  known  you  need  a  glossary  of 
terms  to  understand  what’s  being  said  in  this  town,  but  I’m  re-
minded of it again this morning, Mr. Rosen, ‘‘zero funding is a call 
to  action.’’  I  come  from  a  small  town,  but  you  know,  I  recognize  a 
big hoax here. Zero funding is not a call to anything, it’s zero fund-
ing,  it  means  you  want  to  shut  the  place  down.  And  I  agree  with 
my colleague, Senator Lott, I think that’s an absurd proposition. 

Look,  34  years  ago  this  started  because  there  was  nobody  inter-
ested in running passenger service. The railroads had shut it down, 
and  so  we  created  passenger  service.  We  created  it,  there  was  no 
competition,  there  was  no  one  interested  in  doing  it.  And,  let  me 
also  say,  just  as  I  finish  the  comment,  I’d  be  glad  to  have  you  re-
spond, we’ve seen decisions based on bad intelligence in this town, 
in very significant ways, let me describe another decision based on 
bad intelligence. 

Secretary  Mineta  was  in  Detroit,  this  was  last  month,  and  he 
was  asked  about  a  previous  comment  he’d  made  when  he  said, 
‘‘Amtrak  runs  routes  that  nobody  wants  to  ride,’’  he  said,  ‘‘The 
problem is,’’ now this is quoting the Secretary, ‘‘The Empire Build-
er is going from Seattle to Chicago and it’s going through, let’s say, 
Montana, but there are only 53 people a day using that train serv-
ice.  Can  I  really  justify  pouring  that  kind  of  subsidy  into  the  Em-
pire  Builder  for  that  segment  of  service?’’  Well,  unaccustomed  as  I 
am  to  speak  up  for  Montana,  let  me  just  say—and  they’re  good 
neighbors  of  ours,  but  my  colleague  speaks  up  for  them  daily—in 
fact,  the  Empire  Builder  in  2004  handled  437,000  passengers, 
that’s the Empire Builder, 1,195 per day, one eastbound, one west-
bound  train,  and  I  have  the  boardings  and  so  on  for  Montana,  but 
if you miss the mark by this much, in order to make your case, you 
don’t  like  long  distance  trains,  speaking  for  the  Administration, 
what’s left? 

You  all  probably  want  to  respond  to  some  of  this,  except  I  just 
want  to  say  this:  I  think  it  is  worthy  of  this  country  to  continue 
to  make  investments  for  a  national  rail  passenger  service  system. 
No, not Boston to Florida only, because I expect that route only can 
probably justify itself based on market conditions. Although you get 
competitors  in  there  and  cherry  pick  and  then  we  wonder,  but  I 
think a national rail passenger system is worthy, I’m perfectly will-
ing to subsidize it, I want it to run well, I want it to invest in cap-
ital equipment and infrastructure so that we have a rail passenger 
system that works, but Mr. Gunn cannot run a system under these 
conditions,  it  is  impossible  to  do.  This  Congress  and  this  Adminis-
tration ought to decide—do we want a national rail passenger serv-
ice,  or  not?  But  let’s  not  zero  fund  it  and  say  it’s  a  call  to  action, 
that’s not a call to action. 

If you want to respond to that, it felt good to say it. 
Mr. ROSEN. May I respond to that? 
Senator DORGAN. Yes, of course. 
Mr.  ROSEN.  It  is  a  call  to  action,  and  the  reason  it  is,  is  that  as 
the Secretary said repeatedly—if you and the Administration want-
ed to kill Amtrak, the easy way to do that would be to do nothing. 
The very fact that we came forward with our own reform proposal, 
with  a  different  model  for  passenger  rail  is  a  demonstration  that 
it’s  a  call  to  action.  It  is  saying  we  don’t  want  to  put  money  into

a failed model, into a failed approach, and let’s remember—Amtrak 
is a private corporation. It is somewhat unique in terms of how we 
do  transportation  in  this  country  that  it  does  both  infrastructure 
and  operations.  We  don’t  have,  we  have  Federal  support  for  air-
ports  and  for  highways,  but  we  don’t  provide  an  annual  Federal 
grant  or  an  authorization  for  trucking  companies  or  airlines,  and 
so we have an unusual model there that has produced tremendous 
difficulties  as  you  alluded  to,  year  to  year  and  over  the  long  term, 
$29  billion  in  the  last  34  years,  and  everyone  on  this  panel  has 
agreed  that  there  is  a  need  for  change.  So,  I  would  suggest,  re-
spectfully,  that  the  zero  budget  is  both  a  call  to  action,  and  a  rec-
ognition that the old model doesn’t work. 

Now,  with  regard  to  the  issue  of  the  subsidies  on  long  distance 
trains, let me just quickly say the Secretary’s point on that is that 
the subsidies per rider are extremely high——

Senator  DORGAN.  That’s  not  what  he  was  saying,  go  ahead  and 

defend him, but defend him based on what he said. 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Let  me  make  the  point.  The  subsidies  in  the  aggre-
gate  for  a  per  passenger  mile,  for  passenger  rail,  exceed  any  other 
mode of transportation. And that takes me to the bottom line point 
that  I  want  to  just  get  to,  in  terms  of  long  distance.  We  have  to 
think  of  our  national  transportation  system  as  a  multi-modal  sys-
tem, that we have buses, we have cars, we have airplanes, we have 
rail.  And  for  different  locations,  there’s  a  mix  of  what  are  the  best 
solutions, and in the end, we have to be looking for what’s cost ef-
fective for different parts of the country. 

Senator DORGAN. Please understand, there’s a difference between 
cost  and  value,  and  in  North  Dakota,  90,000  people  get  on  and  off 
Amtrak,  many  of  them  elderly,  it  is  a  very  important  part  of  our 
transportation system. 

Mr. ROSEN. And I don’t minimize that at all, sir, I think we want 

to work with you on those kinds of issues. 

Senator  DORGAN.  What  I’m  saying  is,  though,  the  Secretary  of 
Transportation apparently has an involvement in recommendations 
of  what  to  do  with  Amtrak,  and  he  certainly  has  a  profound  mis-
understanding about the Empire Builder. That train goes from Chi-
cago to Seattle, carries a lot of people from Montana and North Da-
kota,  is  a  wonderful  train,  and  I’m  just  asking  you  to  straighten 
him out on the numbers, because he’s profoundly misunderstanding 
what’s happening there. 

And I want to make one final comment. There isn’t any question 
that rather than a call to action, you, Mr. Rosen, and the Adminis-
tration  want  to  shut  down  long  distance  trains.  I  understand  that, 
but  why  don’t  you  just  say  it,  rather  than  use  words  that  seem  to 
mean  something  else.  If  you  don’t  like  long  distance  trains,  try  to 
shut  them  down,  we’ll  have  a  fight  about  that,  but  in  the  end,  I 
think we should keep Amtrak, we ought to provide the funding nec-
essary for capital investment, the funding necessary for infrastruc-
ture,  and  then  ask  Mr.  Gunn  to  run  a  railroad  based  on  business 
principles, but I sure think at this point we’re moving in the wrong 
direction,  I  couldn’t  agree  more  with  my  colleague,  Senator  Lott’s 
comments  at  the  start  of  this,  and  that  may  have  been  surprising 
to  some  of  you,  but  I  know  that  he’s  cared  a  lot  about  Amtrak  for 
a long, long time, as have many of us on this Committee.

So, I appreciate the contribution, I’m sorry I was a bit late to the 
hearing, but I have read all of the testimony, I appreciate the con-
tributions that you’ve made today. 

Mr.  MEAD.  Senator  Dorgan?  I  just  want  to  make  a  quick  com-
ment. I thought you really described well the responsibilities on the 
Congress  and  the  Administration,  and  for  each  of  the  last  3  years, 
on the Appropriations Committee, we do this annual Death Dance, 
and  we  fight  over  the  appropriate  funding  level.  And  I  have  made 
a point, in each of the last 3 years that it is time for a reauthoriza-
tion, that’s the only way of government in handling programs. And, 
what  we’ve  really  been  doing  is  we’ve  been  running  the  authoriza-
tion process through the appropriations process for each of the last 
3 years, and the piecemeal fashion is not a good one. 

Senator LOTT. Good point, Senator Burns? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS,

U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA 

Senator BURNS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, thank you 
for  this  hearing  this  morning,  and  I  guess  I’m  with  my  colleague 
in  North  Dakota,  we  have  the  same  concerns  that  he  does,  and 
there’s a lot of misinformation, I think, that is sent out to the pub-
lic, and why we have a big misunderstanding. I, on this particular 
subject,  I  learned  a  long  time  ago,  Mr.  Rosen,  Mr.  Mead,  and  Mr. 
Laney  and  Gunn,  Top  Gunn,  that  anything  that’s  really  done  to 
benefit  a  community  is  seldom  done  with  the  blessings  of  a  major-
ity.  And  later  on  it’s  found  that  your  worst  critics  are  the  biggest 
fans  of  the  idea  20  years  later.  We’re  dealing  in  a  national  trans-
portation  system  here  that  I  think  would  be  awfully  hard  for  it 
ever to break even, under any model. Even with the grant program, 
and  here  I  live  in  a  state  that’s  148,000  square  miles,  from  up 
there  in  the  northwest  corner  to  the  southeast  corner  is  further 
than  from  Chicago  to  Washington,  D.C.,  with  900,000  people,  and 
we’re expected to make the match. That’s going to be tough. In the 
airline  industry,  we’re  regarded  as  one  of  those  ‘‘fly  over’’  states. 
And with Amtrak, it is definitely not a fly through, because it’s just 
not  passenger.  There  is  cargo.  We  have  people  along  that  system 
that  use  it  daily,  in  their  freight  business,  because  that’s  the  only 
way  they  can  get  it  in  there  out  of  Chicago  or  Minneapolis,  or  the 
other way from Spokane or Seattle. We are isolated. And the same 
worry that Senator Pryor had for his state, what if some state falls 
out  of  that  thing,  and  you  lose  the  service  because  one  state  does 
not choose to participate in your grant program. 

The  Chairman,  we’re  working  with  the  Chairman  very  hard  on 
reauthorization,  and  to  come  up  with  a  new  plan  on  how,  but  I 
don’t think the American people should be lulled into the idea that 
this will make money and stand on its own. I don’t think that you 
can  come  up  with  a  model  that’s  going  to  do  that.  But,  anyway, 
why  should  we  be  any  different  than  in  any  other  mode  of  trans-
portation,  than  to  provide  the  scantiest  of  rail  transportation  sys-
tems  here  and  just  call  it  what  it  is,  we’re  going  to  have  to  sub-
sidize  it.  I  don’t  know  of  a  bus  service  in  any  city  that  pays  for 
itself. I don’t know of any kind of transportation that’s intercity or 
intracity  that  pays  for  itself.  Light  rail  or  anything,  that  pays  for 
itself.  This  is  something  that  the  American  people  say,  ‘‘We  need

45

this,  and  it’s  going  to  cost  some  taxpayer  dollars  in  order  to  make 
it  operate.’’  And  we  should  face  that  point,  give  the  true  figures, 
and  the  ridership  and  all  of  this,  instead  of  going  through  this 
thing every year, and we’re going to go through the appropriations 
process, and we’ll do the right thing, I’m sure of that, but let’s tell 
the American people that this is an essential service, it is a service 
that  the  American  people  have  chosen  to  have,  and  that  a  certain 
amount  of  taxpayer  dollars  is  going  take  to  make  it  work.  And 
that’s all I have to say. 

Mr. ROSEN. I didn’t mean to interrupt you. 
Senator BURNS. No, no, you can respond if you’d like. 
Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  what  I’d  like  to  say  is  a  couple  of  things,  Sen-
ator,  because  I  think  that  you  raise  some  important  points,  and  I 
think  they’re  points  that  are  worth  thinking  through  a  lot.  You 
have a multi-modal system that’s always, for me at least, the start-
ing  point  as  to  how  we’re  going  to  get  people  where  they  need  to 
go,  it’s  never  one  answer,  it’s  never,  ‘‘We  just  need  a  rail  system, 
or  we  just  need  something,’’  it’s  what’s  cost  effective,  what’s  going 
to work. Now, we talk about the long distance trains, they perform 
a  slightly  different  function  than  the  corridor  trains,  the  corridor 
trains have a heavy business-type function, a lot of people, they are 
just trying to get from one city to the next, much like on the North-
east  Corridor.  The  long  distance  trains  are  more  mixed,  there’s  a 
lot  of  people  that  it’s  a  leisure  trip.  And,  you  have  to  think  of  it 
a little differently, sometimes. And I’m not, myself, persuaded, that 
it’s  true  to  say  that  no  long  distance  train  can  every  operate  with-
out  a  subsidy.  I  mean,  you’re  talking  about  an  area  of  the  country 
where  you’re  from,  Senator,  very  attractive  and  scenic,  and  it  de-
pends  whether  you  could  make  the  trains  more  attractive,  so  that 
people that aren’t currently using them, and if we’re separating in-
frastructure,  because  your  point  is,  that  it’s  hard  to  make  things 
profitable  when  you  have  to  cover  major  capital  costs,  but  if  you 
separate  out  the  infrastructure,  and  you  say  there  are  matching 
grants for that, so then we’re talking about, are you subsidizing the 
operations, we generally in this country don’t subsidize operations. 
And, harkening back, then, to the question I think Senator Lau-
tenberg  had  raised  on  the  U.K.,  the  World  Bank  released  a  study 
on  the  U.K.  system  last  September,  and  what  the  U.K.  has  done 
was  create  25  operating  companies,  which  was  separate  from  who 
runs the infrastructure, and they had them as franchises. Eight of 
those require no subsidies, and the World Bank concluded that the 
system of competing operating companies in the U.K. was actually, 
produced  more  traffic,  more  passengers,  more  than  economic 
growth alone would have called for, and that the safety record was 
better than the old British rail monopoly. 

So,  all  these  things,  it  ultimately  comes  down  to,  let’s  take  a 
careful look at what the facts are and try to do something that will 
work for the people in your state and other states that will improve 
intercity passenger rail. 

Senator BURNS. I would agree with you on some of those assump-
tions,  and  some  of  those  are  fact,  and  I  look  forward  to  working 
with  you  on  this,  but  we—I’ll  tell  you  what  we  board,  we  board 
140,000  people  at  White  Fish,  Montana,  now  that’s  summertime, 
that’s  Glacier  Park,  that’s  skiing  in  the  wintertime  at  Big  Moun-

tain, you’re probably familiar with that area up there, and then the 
rest  of  that  is  kind  of  what  we  call  train  over,  to  get  to  there.  But 
it’s  very,  very  important  in  those  stops  along  the  way  on  the  Hi-
Line,  because  we  subsidize  a  little  air  for  them,  but  that  doesn’t 
take  the  place  of  that  train  and  people  who  like  to  ride  that  train. 
So,  we’ll  be  working  very  hard  on  this  reauthorization.  We  have 
some  ideas,  the  Chairman  has  some  ideas,  we  look  forward  to 
working  with  you  so  that  we’ve  got  some  sort  of  consistency,  and 
a  program  that  we  can  move  forward  with,  that  doesn’t  just  scare 
everybody  to  death  in  Montana,  or  North  Dakota,  or  Idaho  and 
Washington every time appropriations or the budget comes up, be-
cause  this  just  makes  it  a  political  football,  it  makes  it  doubly 
tough  to  solve.  So  we’re  trying  to  work  right  now  on  a  plan  that 
would  allow  us  to  move  forward,  knowing  what  the  numbers  and 
the figures are, and if there’s someplace that we can privatize it or 
whatever,  I’m  sure  we’ll  explore  those  avenues.  I  look  forward  to 
working with you, but in the meantime, it’s pretty important to us, 
and you can see why we get very, very nervous about it. But there 
has  to  be  some  sort  of  common  sense  to  the  approach  of  what  we 
do. And I thank you for your testimony today. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator LOTT. Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator  SUNUNU.  I  think  I’ll  take  a  crack  at  what  zero  funding 
really  means.  I  think  zero  funding  means  that,  and  I  think  Mr. 
Mead  alluded  to  this,  the  current  process  of  allocating  funds  and 
to a significant extent, the current use of funding, is unacceptable. 
When you look at the way money is being used, and you say, ‘‘ This 
system, this process, this allocation is not acceptable,’’ then you ob-
viously  pull  back  until  you  can  reorganize  the  way  that  the  funds 
are  being  allocated.  I  think  more  than  anything,  that’s  what  zero 
funding  means,  or  zero  funding  is  trying  to  convey,  and  I  think 
that’s  what  the  sentiments  were  when  someone  said  zero  funding 
is meant to be a wakeup call. We can argue about exactly what the 
intentions  of  a  given  individual  is  when  they  say,  ‘‘ This  is  a 
wakeup  call,’’  or  ‘‘We  need  to  change  the  process,’’  or  ‘‘ We  need  to 
make  modifications,’’  but  my  concern  is  that  we’re  going  to  go 
through  a  lot  of  discussion  about  authorization  and  rail  transpor-
tation and people in the economy, and we’re going to end up in ex-
actly the same place, and I may be alone in the opinion that a $200 
per  person  subsidy  for  a  train  ride  is  excessive,  I  may  be  alone  in 
thinking that $500 million operating losses in perpetuity to operate 
12  or  14  or  15  routes  is  unacceptable,  but  I  don’t  think  it’s  a  very 
good  use  of  taxpayers  money.  In  New  Hampshire,  $500  million  is 
a  lot  of  money.  That  isn’t  to  say  that  every  route  operated  by  Am-
trak  needs  to  show  a  per  passenger  profit,  but  we  really  do  need 
to  inject  a  little  bit  of  fiscal  reality  into  this  debate.  I  won’t  say 
there’s been no such reality in the discussions, but I haven’t heard 
a great deal. 

A  few  specific  points.  First,  a  point  was  made,  and  I  think  it’s 
worth  repeating,  because  I  don’t  know  that  it  really  sank  in,  but 
the subsidies, per mile, in these endeavors are higher than the per

47

mile subsidies in any other form of transportation. Even those that 
we may all support, intercity bus or intercity transit, even those in-
volving  the  subsidies  that  we  all  know  are  provided  at  some  level 
to  aviation,  and  even  to  highways,  in  the  way  we  collect  and  levy 
taxes.  But  the  subsidies  here  are  dramatically  higher  than  any 
other area of transportation. 

Second,  the  suggestion  that  every  bus  line  in  the  company  re-
quires  a  subsidy  isn’t  the  case.  There  are  possibly  bus  lines  that 
are  connecting  the  cities  in  these  long-distance  routes  operating 
without  a  subsidy,  or  to  the  extent  that  we  might  define  a  tax,  or 
the  money  we  put  into  the  highways  as  a  subsidy,  at  a  per  pas-
senger  subsidy  that  isn’t  even  in  the  same  zip  code  as  the  ones 
we’re  talking  about  here.  And  while  they  may  have  been  touched 
on  very  briefly  at  the  beginning  of  this  hearing,  I’d  like  to  get  in 
a  little  bit  of  questioning  to  clarify  for  me  what  the  size  of  these 
operating losses are. 

Why  don’t  we  begin  with  Mr.  Gunn?  What  were  the  operating 

losses on long distance trains in 2004? 

Mr. GUNN. If you use the FRA cost, which is the direct cost, long 

distance trains lose about $300 million a year. 
Senator SUNUNU. What does FRA stand for? 
Mr.  GUNN.  That’s  Federal  Railroad  Administration.  That’s  the 

amount of money you would save if you eliminated those trains. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  I  would  argue  that  those  are  really  two  dif-
ferent questions. The operating loss is not the same as a cost avoid-
ance,  if  you  eliminate  the  trains.  Because  your  point  is,  you  may 
be  losing  $500  million  a  year  in  operating  losses,  and  you’ve  made 
this  argument  before,  that  because  of  your  labor  agreements  you 
would have to continue with some payments of moneys, even if you 
terminated the lines, and so, you don’t want to include that in cal-
culating operating loss. And I would argue that’s probably not how 
most corporations would view an operating loss. 

Mr.  GUNN.  If  we  eliminated  all  of  the  long  distance  trains,  you 
would  save  something  in  the  neighborhood  of,  but  kept  everything 
else, you’d save something like $300 million plus some capital, say 
$350  million.  But,  to  save  that  money,  you  would  have  to  spend 
over  a  billion  dollars  in  labor  protection,  that’s  the  point  we’ve 
made. I’m not——

Senator  SUNUNU.  What  was  the  calculated  operating  loss  in 

2004? 

Mr.  GUNN.  I  said,  using  the  incremental  loss,  the  amount  of 
money you would save by eliminating the trains is about $300 mil-
lion. And then you’d save some capital. 

Senator SUNUNU. What was the operating loss in 2003? 
Mr. GUNN. Actually, our operating loss has been constant. 
Senator SUNUNU. As far as long distance trains. 
Mr.  GUNN.  I  don’t,  I  can’t  remember,  but  it’s  basically  been  con-
stant.  Our  operating  losses  have  been,  since  I’ve  been  here,  we’ve 
basically been able to control it, and it’s been constant. But, I don’t 
remember the loss, the specific loss in 2003. 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Senator,  I  might  be  able  to  just  help  slightly,  what 
I  think  you’re  asking,  on  a  fully  allocated  basis,  if  all  costs,  both 
the  direct  costs  and  then  attributed  cost  for  overhead  and  support 
are  included,  in  Fiscal  Year  2004,  the  subsidy  was  approximately

money. 

$214  per  trip  on  the  long  distance  trains,  and  that  was  up  from 
$158 in Fiscal Year 2000. In the aggregate, that would amount to, 
order of magnitude of a little in excess of $600 million a year. 

Mr.  GUNN.  That’s  fully  allocated,  however.  The  trap  we  can  get 
in  here,  is  if  you’re  talking  about,  we’re  going  to  eliminate  those 
trains,  what  does  it  do  to  Amtrak’s  cash  requirement,  and  I  think 
that’s  the  relevant  question,  it  is  $300–$350  million  after  you  pay 
C–2. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Well,  I  would  say  $350  million  is  also  real 

Mr. GUNN. I’m not arguing that point, Senator. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  I  find  it  somewhat  problematic  that  when  any 
Member  of  Congress  or  any  member  of  the  public  tries  to  get  a 
clear  assessment  of  these  operating  losses,  we  get  generalities—
‘‘ We would save about $300 million, and it depends on how you al-
locate it,’’ and that we get one set of numbers for the allocated op-
erating  loss,  and  we  talked  about  the  opportunity  costs  of  the  con-
tract,  but  I  just  find  it  problematic  that  we  cannot  agree  on,  and 
I  don’t  have  a  preferred  methodology,  but  we  cannot  agree  on  a 
methodology for giving the public an honest assessment of what the 
operating  losses  are,  and  what  the  magnitude  of  the  subsidy  is.  I 
think that does a disservice to the Members of the Committee who 
are  working  very  hard  to  make  decisions.  We  may  disagree,  Sen-
ator  Lautenberg  may  say,  ‘‘ This  is  important,  we  should  provide  a 
subsidy  to  maintain  operation  in  a  particular  way,’’  and  he  may 
value that subsidy at a particular level, and I may say, ‘‘ That’s not 
an  acceptable  subsidy,  but  it  would  be  great  if  we  could  at  least 
agree on the set of facts before us.’’

Mr.  GUNN.  I  don’t  mean  to  argue  with  you,  Senator,  but  every 
month  we  produce  an  income  statement,  a  set  of  financials  which 
include  an  income  statement,  a  performance  statement  by  train. 
Now,  for  example,  I  have  the  February  results.  I  have  March  re-
sults,  but  I  don’t  have  the  detailed  train  sheets  yet.  But,  we 
produce,  and  we  use,  we  show  the  deficit  by  different  costing,  in 
other  words,  the  FRA-defined  costs,  which  are  really  the  incre-
mental  costs,  then  we  have  other  overhead  costs  which  would  go 
away  if  you  could  get  at  them,  which  means  all  the  trains  would 
go  away,  but  we  produce,  every  month,  there’s  no  shortage  of  rou-
tine  data,  and  it’s  according  to  GAP,  it’s  auditable  and  we’ve  done 
this since I’ve been here. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  And  the  aggregate  operating  loss  shown  by 

those statements for 2004——

Mr.  GUNN.  I  have,  for  example,  through  February,  the  long  dis-
tance  trains,  which  is  what  we’re  talking  about,  the  FRA-defined 
loss was $100 million, and that’s for 5 months. 

Senator LOTT. Mr. Gunn, I hope you work with Senator Sununu, 

data——

and all of us, to get the data. 

Mr.  GUNN.  But  the  data  is  here,  my  only  point  is,  we  have  the 

Senator  SUNUNU.  It’s  just  frustrating  to  hear  different  ways  of 
presenting the question about the subsidy and the operating losses. 
I  know—to  be  clear—that  you  have  received  a  lot  of  credit  for  im-
proving  the  reporting  and  for  improving  the  accounting,  but  we’re 
making policy decisions.

Mr. GUNN. The results, I can’t improve. 
Senator  LOTT.  Senator  Stevens,  the  Chairman  of  the  full  Com-
mittee  is  here  and  I  know  he  may  have  some  comments  and  some 
questions. 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, first, Mr. Mead, I know that Amtrak’s car-

rying a $3.2 billion debt, the interest rate’s about 10 percent. 

Mr. MEAD. Now, on part of that, sir, it is about 9.5 percent, they 
mortgaged  Penn  Station  a  few  years  ago  to  Credit  Lyonnais,  I 
think. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Did  you  ever  make  the  recommendation  that  it 

be made tax free? Let them issue tax free bonds? 

Mr. MEAD. No, we didn’t make that recommendation, but we are 
recommending  that  the  reauthorization  have  the  Treasury  dis-
charge  that  debt,  because  you’re  paying  it  anyway  at  a  higher  in-
terest  rate,  so  if  you’re  going  to  pay  it  anyway,  you  might  as  well 
pay it at a cheaper interest rate. 

The CHAIRMAN. That might encourage you to enter more debt, if 

we made it part of the national——

Mr.  MEAD.  The  second  thing  I’d  do,  Senator  Stevens,  is  freeze 
their  ability  to  borrow.  Their  freedom  to  borrow  is  what  got  us  in 
this hole, and so that’s the second thing I would do. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  For  the  Amtrak  people,  when  the  Alaska  Rail-
road  got  into  trouble,  we  finally  worked  out  an  arrangement  that 
our  state  bought  the  Alaska  railroad,  and  now  we  have  sort  of  a 
partnership,  as  the  President  mentioned  in  connection  with  this 
issue  when  he  set  up  this  recommendation.  Have  you  looked  at 
that  proposal?  Why  shouldn’t  these  states  buy  a  piece  of  this  rail-
road and let us work together. Our state covers, basically, the oper-
ating  expenses,  and  the  Federal  Government  assists  us  in  capital 
investment. Why isn’t that a model for you all, too? 

Mr.  GUNN.  The  problem,  Senator,  is  that  the  Alaska  Railroad  is 
an  intrastate  operation,  and  with  Amtrak,  the  bulk  of  our  service 
is  interstate,  and  some  of  our  trains  go  through  eight,  nine  states. 

The CHAIRMAN. That’s where it fails, doesn’t it? 
Mr.  GUNN.  Yes,  but  I  think  you  get  into  the  situation  where  ev-
erybody  will  hold  their  money  in  reserve  until  they’re  faced  with 
a crisis, and by that time it’s too late. I think Alaska was very wise 
with  what  they  did,  and  even  in  the  Northeast  Corridor,  which  is 
where  we  run  track  and  run  the  whole  thing,  we  still  go  through 
eight states, and it’s very difficult. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Have  you  suggested  a  model  where  there’d  be 

some kind of sharing? Why shouldn’t the states be part of this? 

Mr.  GUNN.  Well,  actually,  in  the  Board  package  we  do,  the  Re-
form  Package  that  Amtrak’s  put  forward,  the  goal  is  to  get  the 
states  to  move  to  a  situation  where  the  states  pay  the  operating 
deficit,  similar  to  the  Alaska  situation,  for  their  corridor  services. 
That’s  what  we’re  proposing,  but  to  do  that,  you  need  to  give  the, 
you  have  to  have  the  partnership  which  the  Alaska  Railroad  has 
on capital. 

The CHAIRMAN. Is the Amtrak Board representative of the states 

that have the major part of the riders of Amtrak?

Mr. LANEY. Senator, I’m the Chairman of the Board, and I’m de-
lighted you’ve joined us. We’ll want to visit with you further about 
what’s  going  on  in  Alaska,  it’s  a  model  we’ve  looked  at  carefully, 
we’re  going  to  look  at  it  a  lot  more  carefully,  and  it  makes  a  lot 
of  sense  to  the  extent  we  can  adapt  elements  of  what’s  being  done 
in Alaska to what we’re doing. 

But  we  have  four  members  of  the  Board,  and  they,  I  think,  rep-
resent a variety of states, depending on where they live during the 
year,  from  the  kind  of  states  that  have  only  long  distance  service, 
the states that are centered right in the middle of a group of states 
that  enjoy  the  benefits  of  the  Northeast  Corridor,  so  I  think  we’re 
fairly  well  represented,  as  well  as  you  know,  one  member  of  the 
Board  is  Secretary  Mineta,  and  he’s  designated  Mr.  Rosen  as  his 
representative on the Board, so we’ve got the Department of Trans-
portation and it’s perspective brought to bear with all of our discus-
sions and thinking and planning as well. So, it’s a broad represen-
tation. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  So,  have  you  engaged  the  states,  and  the  Gov-
ernors and their staffs in conversation of how to save this railroad? 
Mr. LANEY. Yes, sir, we have, in a number of different ways, and 
they are, they’ve made it very clear, I think virtually all states that 
enjoy one benefit or another from Amtrak, that they are very inter-
ested  in  being  heard,  and  we’ve  made  it  equally  clear  that  we  are 
very  interested  in  hearing  from  them.  They’ve  already  contributed 
a lot to what you see in our proposal with respect to long distance 
and corridor service. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  How  important  is  long  distance  service,  com-

pared to the commuter service on this train? 

Mr.  LANEY.  I  don’t  know  that  I  could  compare  the  two,  they’re 
apples  and  oranges,  but  both  are  essential  elements,  we  believe  to 
the future of intercity passenger rail. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  when  I  came  to  the  Senate,  those  of  us 
from  the  West  came  to  the  Senate,  I  went  home  many  times  by 
rail.  We  found  it  much  more  convenient  and  less  expensive  than 
travel by air. I know you don’t understand a necessity for long dis-
tance, federally supported trains. Tell me, why is there a necessity 
for these long distance trains going west? 

Mr.  GUNN.  I’ll  take  a  crack  at  that,  if  I  may,  I  think  if  you  look 
at the ridership on the long distance trains, we’ve got a report that 
details  each  of  the  trains,  which  you’re  welcome  to  see,  you’ll  see 
that  the  ridership  on  the  bulk  of  these  trains,  or  the  bulk  of  the 
ridership  on  these  trains  is  not  endpoint  to  endpoint.  If  you  take 
the Empire Builder, for example, that Senator Dorgan was talking 
about,  that  train  has,  serves  a  lot  of  areas  that  have  no  other  op-
tions, probably a lot like the Alaska Railroad in the north. So, peo-
ple  will  ride  from  Minneapolis  to  Rugby,  or  Minneapolis  to  Havre, 
or  Shelby,  and  these  trains—and  they’re  busy.  The  trains  are  not 
empty,  they  actually  carry  a  lot  of  people.  And,  on  a  number  of 
these  trains  you’re  providing  services  where  there  isn’t  a  good  op-
tion for the people. 

I  would  submit  that  if  you  actually  rode  the  Empire  Builder, 
you’d be surprised at the on/off through all of these towns that we 
go  through—most  of  the  towns  are  2  hours  apart,  but  it’s  a  busy

train, and it provides, I think, an essential service to those commu-
nities. 

The CHAIRMAN. Respectfully, I don’t think that answers the long 
distance  thing,  but  my  time’s  up.  I  hope  you’ve  all  read  that  de-
lightful new book, The Christmas Train. If you haven’t, it would be 
worthwhile. 

Mr.  MEAD.  I  have  some  numbers  here  that  respond  to  the  ques-
tions.  There  are  about  4  million  riders  on  the  long  distance  trains 
that  you  referred  to.  This  is  an  annual  figure  for  2004,  4  million. 
The CHAIRMAN. Are they going the long distance, or are they just 

riding part way on the long distance? 

Mr. MEAD. I’m coming to that. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  Can  I  clarify  that?  4  million  riders,  you  mean, 

4 million embarkments. 

Mr.  MEAD.  I’m  going  to  answer,  if  you  let  me  give  out  the  num-
ber, there were four million total riders for 2004 that got on a long 
distance  train.  Of  that  number,  only  527,000  went  from  beginning 
to  the  end.  Also,  there  were  400,000  that  went  between  city  pairs, 
where you already had the Amtrak corridor services, and our anal-
ysis showed that the remaining three million people rode about be-
tween 500 and 700 miles. And that’s how it broke down. 

The CHAIRMAN. More than—? 
Mr. MEAD. Three million went between 500 and 700 miles. 
The CHAIRMAN. Has that changed since 9/11? 
Mr. MEAD. I don’t know, sir. 
Senator  LOTT.  Well,  we  will  continue  for  another  round.  Thank 

you, Mr. Chairman. 

Looking  at  the  solution  here—and  that’s  what  I  think  we  need 
to  do,  rather  than  just  looking  back  at  where  we  have  been,  but 
looking  forward  at  where  we  want  to  go—I  do  think  we  have  to 
make  a  basic  decision,  Do  we  want  a  national  rail  passenger  sys-
tem,  or  not?  If  we  do,  how  are  we  going  to  pay  for  it?  If  we  don’t, 
this is the year where we need to face up to this. But if we do, how 
we’re going to pay for it? 

And I think we’ve got to do it in three steps. One, I do think we 
need  reauthorization  with  some  innovative  ideas  and  new  options. 
I want to look very carefully, Mr. Laney, at the report you provided 
that—we’ve  been  talking  to  Mr.  Gunn  and  Mr.  Mead  and  a  lot  of 
others  to  try  to  come  up  with  some  ideas  where  this  authorization 
is  not  just  a  rehashment  of  where  we  are.  Second,  I  do  think  we 
need to identify what we really are going to have to do with annual 
appropriations.  But  I  don’t  think  that’s  enough.  I  think  we’ve  got 
to have more. 

And that leads me to the point that Senator Stevens touched on, 
and  I  wanted  to  come  back,  because  I’ve  asked  most  of  you  about 
this before. I do think we’re going to have to have a national trans-
portation  bonding  authority,  capital  bond  authority,  with  the  tax 
incentives that go with it. None of you touched on that. 

Now,  Mr.  Laney,  you’ve  worked  in  this  area.  You’re  a  leader  in 
Texas  in  the  transportation  area.  What  is  your  reaction  to  that? 
What’s your thought about the bonding-authority capability? 

Mr. LANEY. Senator, that’s a question that ultimately goes to the 
heart  of  a  matter  that’s  much  bigger  than  Amtrak  itself  and  goes 
to the overall issue of infrastructure in the rail industry. And most 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  14:17 May 02, 2006 Jkt 026844 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\26844.TXT JACKF PsN: JACKF

52

of  that  infrastructure,  as  you  know,  is  freight-rail  infrastructure. 
Outside  of  the  Northeast  Corridor,  that’s  the  rail  we  operate  on, 
and,  ultimately,  as  go  the  freights  and  their  infrastructure  health, 
so  goes  most  of  Amtrak,  whether  it’s  corridor  service  or  long-dis-
tance service. 

There is—and everyone in the freight-rail industry and in our in-
dustry  and  in  the  highway  industry  know  it—we  are  approaching 
very  significant  constriction  and  bottlenecks  and  congestions 
throughout  our  transportation  system  nationally  in  the  infrastruc-
ture capacity. 

Senator LOTT. So, is this the solution? 
Mr.  LANEY.  Bonding  is  an  enormous  step  forward,  we  think,  in 
terms  of  injecting  potential  capital.  And  I’m  speaking  not  for  the 
board of Amtrak; I’m giving my own——

Senator LOTT. That’s what we’re looking for. 
Mr.  LANEY.  It’s  an  enormous  potential  opportunity  to  address—
to  begin  to  address  the  long-term  issues  and  negative  impacts  of 
capacity  constraints  on  freight  rail,  just  like  we’ve  done  it  in  the 
highway  capacity.  And  there’s  an  interrelationship,  as  you  know 
very well, between freight rail and freight on highways. And freight 
cannot  absorb  the  demand  driven  from  highways  because  of  high-
way congestion in the direction of freight rails. 

Senator LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Laney. 
Mr. Gunn, what’s your comment on——
Mr. GUNN. I agree with my chairman. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator LOTT. He’s a very smart man. 
Mr.  Mead,  you  and  I  have  talked  about  this.  What’s  your  reac-

tion? 

Mr.  MEAD.  Yes.  And  since  that  discussion,  I’ve  given  it  some 
thought.  And  I  think  the  conundrum,  the  big  issue,  on  bonding  is, 
where  would  the  money  come  from  to  pay  the  purchaser  of  the 
bond the RI, the return on investment, during the life of the bond? 
If  you  look  to  a  model  that  Amtrak  proposed  several  years  ago, 
it  worked  like  this.  You  buy  the  bond.  Say,  I’m  Amtrak,  hypo-
thetically.  I  get  $1,000.  I  take  20–25  percent  of  that,  and  I  put  it 
in  an  escrow  account.  And,  over  the  life  of  that  bond,  the  interest 
accruals on that 25 percent that I’ve put aside are sufficient to pay 
off  the  face  value  of  the  bond.  But  you,  as  the  investor,  are  going 
to  say,  ‘‘ Well,  Mr.  Mead,  I  want  a  return  of  investment.  I  don’t 
want to wait 25 years. I want a good return on my investment dur-
ing  the  life  of  the  bond.’’  I  can’t  figure  out  where  that  money’s 
going to come from. In the aviation world, when they float a bond, 
the airlines, the landing fees, all contribute to the repayment of it. 
In  Amtrak’s  situation,  I  don’t  know  where  the  money  would  come 
from. And that’s a conundrum that I’m still trying to work through, 
sir. 

Senator  LOTT.  Well,  we’ll  be  waiting  on  your  answer,  because 
this is what we intend to do, so we’ve got to have some logical an-
swer  to  that  question.  And  you’ve  touched  on  one.  Maybe  you 
touched on both of them. We may have to look at some way to get 
a—some  fee,  some  designated  source  to  make  sure  there’s  repay-
ment there. 

Mr. Rosen, what would be the Administration’s position on that?

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  Senator,  the  question  of  how  bonding  would 
work  often  comes  down  to  the  particulars.  And  so,  I  don’t  know 
that I want to say, in a definitive way, an Administration position, 
but let me suggest that I think there are at least two sets of poten-
tial  difficulties  that  we  would  really  need  to  take  cognizance  of. 
One set of them relates to the whole problem of accountability and 
repayment.  And  Inspector  General  Mead  was  alluding  to  part  of 
that  issue,  of,  how  do  you  ensure  that  there  will  be  repayment? 
But, also, how do you ensure that the funds will be used in the op-
timal  manner,  because,  in  the  private-sector  financing,  the  bond-
holders  are  going  to  be  paying  real  close  care  as  to  whether  those 
debenture  agreements  are  being  fulfilled  and  the  funds  are  being 
used appropriately. 

On  the  other  hand,  anytime  you  talk  about  Federal-backed  or 
subsidized bonds, you have a whole different set of problems, which 
is, is this an efficient way of financing relative to the general fund? 
Because  the  U.S.  Government  can  borrow  money,  and  can  do  it 
pretty  efficiently  and  cheaply.  And  so,  the  question  you  always 
have  to  ask  is,  if  you’re  going  to  create  something  that’s  different 
than  a  U.S.  Treasury  debt  instrument,  what  advantages  are  you 
gaining from that? And that can be an extremely problematic ques-
tion, and it’s one you always have to confront. 

But,  as  I  say,  it  does  come  down  to  the  specifics,  but  I  think  it’s 
a  mistake  for  people  to  just  assume  that  bonding  is  an  easy  thing 
that  gets  us  out  of  the  conundrum  of,  are  we  using  taxpayers’  dol-
lars? Because the ultimate answer may be that we are, and we, ul-
timately,  may  not  be  doing  it  efficiently.  And  so,  those  are  the 
kinds of tests that you have to look at. 

But the—again, as I say, it does come down to the specifics. And 
I don’t want to speak for the Administration in any comprehensive 
way without knowing the details of what we’d be talking about. 

Senator  LOTT.  Well,  I  would  urge  you,  the  Administration,  to 
look  at  this.  If  we’re  going  to  have  a  national  rail  passenger  sys-
tem—and  I  assume  the  Administration  is  for  that—we’re  going  to 
have  to  figure  out  how  we’re  going  to  pay  for  it.  And  I  don’t  think 
what  you’ve  come  up  with  is  enough.  I  mean,  are  you  just  going 
to  rely  on  us  to  appropriate  the  funds  annually?  We’ve  proven  we 
can’t  do  that  in  an  adequate  way.  So,  you  know,  and  competition 
and other things have suggested state participation. That’s all fine, 
but  I  don’t  think  it’s  enough.  So,  we  need  a  little  more  innovative 
thinking  from  the  Administration  on  how  we’re  going  to  do  more, 
if  we  want  to  do  this  in  a  responsible  way.  And  I  urge  you  to  look 
at that. 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Senator,  I  hear  your  general  point  on  that,  and  I 
think  the  fundamental  problem  that  I  think  many  people  are  con-
cerned  about,  and  I  infer  you  may  be,  is  the  multi-year  problem, 
that it’s not so much that it’s an appropriation, but that it’s an an-
nual  event.  And  I  think  we  would  be  interested  in  working  with 
you and this Committee, and perhaps the appropriators, as well, to 
think about how to deal with that aspect. 

Senator LOTT. Thank you very much. 
Senator Lautenberg? 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I  wonder,  in  terms  of  sources  of  funds,  what  do  you  think  of  the 
security—our  security  requirements  are,  relative  to  rail  service? 
Mr. Rosen, do you think there’s any need to have a comprehensive 
rail system throughout the country, in the event of attacks by those 
who would bring us harm? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  I  think  that’s  bound  up  in  the  larger  question 
of—one of our fundamental transportation policies is to have mobil-
ity—is  to  have  nationwide  mobility  and,  as  I’ve  alluded  to  earlier, 
a  multimodal  system.  So,  you  don’t  want  the  system  to  be  entirely 
susceptible  to  a  weak  point  anywhere.  But  I  don’t  think  you  can 
build  one  piece  of  your  system  entirely  on  the  premise  that  this  is 
because we’re concerned about the next attack. The way you try to 
develop a secure system is both to have mobility in multiple modes 
and, as DHS has the lead with respect to—thinking about how you 
provide security measures in the modes. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  We’re  going  to  differ  on  that.  I  think  it’s 
an  essential  part  of  protecting  our  society’s  mobility  in  the  event 
of  a  disaster  such  as  we  saw.  And  I  remember  vividly,  at  9/11, 
when  Amtrak  was  the  only  thing  that  was  running  in  the—that 
area  of  the  country,  and  we  were  so  glad  to  have  that  when  avia-
tion  was  shut  down.  And  if  it  happened  before,  heaven  forbid,  it 
could happen again. 

Secretary  Mineta—we  were  talking  about  subsidies  of  varying 
types—Secretary  Mineta  has  been  quoted  as  saying  that  if  the 
states  won’t  pay  for  service,  then  trains  shouldn’t  open  their  doors 
whole moving through that state. Well, we have an example in the 
State  of  New  Hampshire,  where  it  doesn’t  contribute  anything  to 
the Downeaster service provided by the State of Maine. Would the 
Secretary,  therefore,  say,  eliminate  all  stops  in  New  Hampshire, 
even  though  doing  so  would  significantly  impact  the  ridership  and 
the financial performance of the service? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  again,  I  think  you  have  to  differentiate  be-
tween  the  status  quo  1970  model,  where  the  situation  is  what  you 
describe, but not just in New Hampshire; many places are not cur-
rently providing state support and—because they’re not called upon 
to do so by the existing system of Amtrak. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  So  what  would  the  Secretary’s  view  be, 
based  on  this?  Going  back,  this  is  a  statement,  that  if  the  state 
doesn’t  pay—doesn’t  contribute  anything,  the  doors—the  train, 
even  if  it  passes  through  the  state,  shouldn’t  stop  and  open  them. 
Mr. ROSEN. OK, but let me be clear, the Secretary is not alluding 
to what should happen, or should have happened in the past, with 
regard to the status quo. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. I see. So——
Mr. ROSEN. The Secretary is alluding——
Senator LAUTENBERG.—we’re going to deal in the realm of—you’ll 

forgive me——

Mr. Rosen, you made a statement, in your testimony here, that—
you  say,  likewise,  the  intercity  bus  industry,  no  comprehensive  or 
dedicated Federal operating system carries as many as 350 million 
passengers annually. 

Mr. ROSEN. That’s right. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. The CRS report says that, in fact, there is 
a provision under the—not CRS—what about Section 5311 intercity

bus  program—offers  a  50–50  Federal/State  match  for  intercity  bus 
operations,  and  an  80–20  for  intercity  bus  infrastructure.  Well,  is 
there any challenge in those two positions? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  No,  I  don’t  think  there  is,  Senator,  because  I  think 
what  you’re  alluding  to  is  not  a  comprehensive  Federal  program. 
You’re  talking  about  a  transit  program  that  has  a  small  indirect 
way.  And  I  believe  the  expenditure  on  that’s  about  $20  million  a 
year. So, I don’t think we’re talking about kind of——

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  we’re  not  talking  about  amounts, 

we’re talking about principle here. 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Well,  I  think  the  principle’s  quite  different,  as  well. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. All right, well, I read your statement, ‘‘No 
comprehensive’’—you  can  pick  words  apart  here—‘‘dedicated’’—
there are operating subsidies to some intercity bus operations. 

Mr. ROSEN. Senator, if we were talking about $20 million a year 
for  Amtrak,  I  don’t  believe  we’d  be  having  this  hearing.  I  mean,  I 
think we’re talking about very different——

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you for your opinion, Mr. Rosen. 
I want to ask whether or not—Mr. Gunn, for instance, you might 
be  interested—knowledgeable  about  what  happened  in  the  case  of 
Argentina and Mexico when they eliminated subsidies for intercity 
passenger rail service. 

Mr.  GUNN.  Actually,  I’m  not  very  knowledgeable  of  those  two 

areas. I know the British results better. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. OK. 
Mr. GUNN. But, basically, the Argentine railroads are gone. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. They’re out of business. 
Mr. GUNN. Yes.

Mr. GUNN. Yes.

Mr. GUNN. That’s all I know. I don’t——
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  And  that’s  what  would  happen  if  we  stay 

on this fantasy ride that we want to——

Mr. GUNN. Well, Senator, you asked me a question earlier about 
privatization.  I  think  the  one  thing  everybody  has  to  realize,  that 
no  matter  who’s  running  it,  there’s  going  to  be  a  subsidy.  This  is 
not——

Senator LAUTENBERG. Well——
Mr. GUNN.—going to be a profit——
Senator LAUTENBERG.—I think a good way to invite companies or 
organizations to compete is, tell them there’s a subsidy. Unless we 
just outright say, ‘‘If we ever go private, there will never be a sub-
sidy  by  the  Federal  Government.’’  And  I  think  that  would  change 
the conditions a lot. 

Mr.  ROSEN.  Senator,  could  I  just  offer  a  thought  on  that?  The 
place where perhaps we differed is, the Administration is—finds it 
acceptable to have what you could call a subsidy for infrastructure.

But  we’re  talking  about  operations.  And  on  the  train  operations—
for example, the Alaska railroad is not subsidized on operations. It 
is——

Senator LAUTENBERG. You don’t want to discuss the Alaska rail-
road.  You  have  to  look  at  how  Alaska  was  skillful  enough  to  ac-
quire that railroad and the costs that——

[Laughter.] 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—it takes, and then we—New Jersey would 

take that anytime. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  one  thing  that  we  see 
here—and I think you were very clear in your comments—and that 
is  that  we’ve  got  to  step  up  to  the  plate  with  this  thing,  and  we 
can’t pretend that there’s not a problem here, that, frankly, I think, 
would  have  a  gigantic  effect  on  the  way  people  move  through  our 
country. We’d have—we’ve got essential air service because it’s nec-
essary. That’s why it’s there. Otherwise, you’d never get it through 
here.  And  we  provide  that  service.  It’s  fairly  high  cost.  Some  are 
a  couple  of  hundred  dollars  a  passenger.  And  that’s  what  govern-
ment’s  for.  It  may  surprise  people  here  to  know  that  we  even  pay 
for border protection and lots of other things, and healthcare. Gee, 
that’s a surprise. That’s what government’s about—supplying serv-
ices,  my  friends,  and  we’ve  got  to  continue  to  supply  services.  And 
I hope, Mr. Chairman, that when we get to work on our bill, we’re 
going  to  make  sure  that  there  is  a  national  passenger  rail  service, 
and  one  that  has  enough  investment  in  infrastructure  to  bring  it 
up to modern times. 

Senator  LOTT.  Thank  you,  Senator  Lautenberg.  And  I’m  looking 
forward  to  working  with  you  on  this.  And  I  do  think  the  Federal 
Government has a role to play. Where people, or cities, individuals, 
can’t  do  things  for  themselves,  the  Federal  Government  does  have 
a  role.  Personally,  I  don’t  like  operating  subsidies  to  intercity—in-
tracity transit systems. And I wonder how much of a responsibility 
the  government  has  to  pay  for  a  lot  of  things—a  lot  of  individuals’ 
needs.  But  in  other  cases,  like  in  transportation,  it  is  interstate. 
The individual and the state, or the city, can’t do it by itself. That’s 
why  I  do  view  this  one,  and  other  transportation  programs,  as  dif-
ferent from just Federal Government subsidizing everything. 

Senator Sununu? 
Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Obviously, if you’re running intercity rail, and a national rail sys-
tem  is  going  to  be  intercity,  but  I  would  certainly  draw  the  Com-
mittee’s attention to page 3 of Mr. Rosen’s testimony, which clearly 
shows  the  percentage  of  intercity  transportation  that  is  rail.  I  as-
sume this is all rail. Mr. Rosen, it is all rail? 

Mr. ROSEN. It’s all intercity rail. In other words, it wouldn’t cover 

trolley cars in the city, for example. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  It’s  a  very  small  portion.  It  looks  like  it’s  less 
than  1  percent,  to  me.  But  when  the  line  starts  hugging  the  very 
bottom  of  the  graph,  it’s  hard  to  tell.  And  so,  we  get  back  to  the 
question of, well, to what extent do we wish to subsidize this level 
of ridership and this portion of ridership? 

I’m sorry Senator Lautenberg has left, but I’m going to say good 
things about him, in general, in this sense. I don’t know that I sup-

port  the  idea  of  New  Jersey  taking  over  the  Northeast  Corridor, 
but  I  do  think  that  that’s  the  kind  of  idea  that  at  least  ought  to 
be explored. Whether it’s New Jersey or a combination of states in 
the Northeast Corridor taking responsibility for owning, operating, 
managing,  making  capital  resource  allocations,  creating  incentives 
for  riders,  marketing,  and  all  the  rest,  I  think  they  would,  in  all 
likelihood, do a far better job than is being done under the current 
umbrella.  That’s  not  a  comment  on  management  quality  so  much 
as it is a commentary on the structure itself and the mandate we’re 
putting  on  this  entity  to  continue  to  operate  nationwide.  And  it 
does come back to——

Senator  LOTT.  Could  I  inquire  of  the  Senator,  under  those  cir-
cumstances, where a group of states would get together to manage 
and  operate  and  pay—they  would  also  pay  for  everything;  there 
wouldn’t be a Federal subsidy under that arrangement, right? 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Perhaps.  But,  then  again,  perhaps  they  would 
do  a  better  job  if  they  were  to  negotiate  a  subsidy.  My  guess  is  it 
would  be  dramatically  less  than  the  one  we’re  currently  providing. 
But——

Senator LOTT. My point is——
Senator SUNUNU. And——
Senator  LOTT.—we,  in  Mississippi,  are  not  going  to  be  willing  to 

help pay for that service just up there——

Senator SUNUNU. We are not negotiating——
Senator LOTT.—in the Northeast. 
Senator SUNUNU.—a contract now, but I——
[Laughter.] 
Senator SUNUNU.—certainly understand that the——
Senator LOTT. I just want to make sure everybody——
Senator  SUNUNU.—that  the  nature  and  the  structure  of  the  sub-
sidy may be different, but there still may be a subsidy, nonetheless. 
In  response  to  the  question  about  the  state’s  share  and  the 
Downeaster,  in  particular,  if  we  went  to  a  system  where  we  had 
state-sharing—I  think  Mr.  Rosen  was  being  very  polite  to  me;  he 
didn’t  want  to  make  an  awkward  comment  about  New  Hamp-
shire—but if we went to a system where we had state-sharing, and 
that  was  the  methodology  for  support  and  finance  of  very  reason-
ably  strong  systems  like  the  Northeast  Corridor,  and  a  state  like 
New  Hampshire  didn’t  want  to  participate,  I  suppose,  in  theory,  it 
would be appropriate for there not to be stops in that state. 

Now,  I  think  that,  again,  if  the  states  had  a  sharing  arrange-
ment,  they  would  look  out  for  their  riders,  their  commuters,  their 
travelers,  their  economic  interests,  and  come  to  an  agreement 
about  how  best  to  approach  it.  But  that’s  not  the  system  in  which 
we’re  operating.  The  Downeaster,  in  particular,  was  a  route  that 
was instituted with a great deal of help from former Senator Mitch-
ell  in  order  to  provide  service  to  Portland.  The  contract  for  oper-
ating  that  was  negotiated  largely  under  the  auspices  of  the  Maine 
Rail Authority. In partnership with New Hampshire, they’ve estab-
lished a couple of stops in New Hampshire, as well as the ones that 
are in Maine. 

But the problem is, we’re not in that situation. And I don’t think 
that that’s an especially clever way to argue against the kind of re-
forms people have suggested here.

issue? 

Mr. ROSEN. Senator, could I elaborate on one aspect of that? Be-
cause  I  think  you  make  very  good  points.  It’s  also  not  impossible 
for a state to determine—and this is where I was going when Sen-
ator  Lautenberg  asked  me  to  stop—that  even  if  New  Hampshire 
didn’t want to participate, that the people in Maine and Massachu-
setts  want  to  be  able  to  stop  in  New  Hampshire,  and  that  Maine 
and Massachusetts would simply decide they’ll pick up the tab. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  It  would  be  very  parochial  of  me  to  suggest 
that  people  from  Maine  and  Massachusetts  wanted  to  visit  New 
Hampshire, but I think you make a very good point. 

Mr.  MEAD.  One—may  I  make  a  point  on  this—the  operating 

Senator SUNUNU. Yes, please. 
Mr.  MEAD.  In  our  oral  testimony,  and  in  our  written  statement, 
there’s a section on capital grants, and there’s a section on formula 
grants without a required match. That’s designed for states, during 
this  reauthorization  period,  to  get  something  when  they  may  not 
have opportunities for capital development—but where the Federal 
Government  would  contribute,  without  match  required,  to  that 
state, a grant. Now, if the state’s not going to use the grant for rail, 
they’re not going to—they shouldn’t get it. Now, it would not cover 
100 percent of the loss, so the State of New Hampshire would have 
to pay more than it’s paying now. 

Senator SUNUNU. Under a state-share program. 
Mr. MEAD. There would be—I think it’s fair to say——
Senator SUNUNU. Well, by definition, since we don’t have a state-
share  program  now,  and  we  went  to  a  state-share  program,  then 
states would have to share more than they’re sharing now. 

Mr. MEAD. Right. I have a——
Senator  SUNUNU.  I  don’t  mean  to  belittle  the  point,  but  there’s 
no  question,  this  would  be  a  different  form  of  subsidy,  but,  at  the 
same  time,  let’s  not  think  that  taxpayers  in  New  Hampshire  or 
California  or  Oklahoma  or  Mississippi  aren’t  providing  some  sub-
sidy  now.  They’re  just  not  providing  it  through  their  state  govern-
ment;  they’re  providing  it  in  the  form  of  Federal  tax  revenues——

Mr. MEAD. That’s exactly right. 
Senator  SUNUNU.—that  are  contributed  to  Amtrak  at  a  clip  of 

roughly $1.2 billion per year. 

Mr.  MEAD.  Right.  And  I’ve  got  in  front  of  me  a  list  of  the  states 
that  actually  do  make  direct  operating-loss  contributions  to  Am-
trak, and also make direct capital contributions. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Those  contributions,  though,  are  done  on  the 
basis  of  agreements  in  which  they  have  voluntarily  entered  into 
with Amtrak. Is that correct? 

Mr.  MEAD.  Under  the  current  model,  yes,  sir,  that’s  absolutely 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Mr.  Gunn,  how  many  long-distance  routes  are 

being operated now? 
Mr. GUNN. Fifteen. 
Senator SUNUNU. Fifteen, OK. I have a list of 16. What’s—in my 
list of 16—I think this is from 2003, early 2004—which one did you 
get rid of? 

Mr. GUNN. The Three Rivers.

Senator  SUNUNU.  Three  Rivers.  But  you’re  still  operating  the 

Pennsylvanian and the Cardinal? 

Mr. GUNN. The Pennsylvania and the Cardinal are still operated.

Mr. GUNN. The Palmetto has been truncated.

Mr.  GUNN.  It  doesn’t  go  south  of  Savannah.  It  used  to  go  to

you’ve eliminated three. So——

Mr.  GUNN.  Did  I  say  the  Cardinal?  I  didn’t  mean  that.  The  Pal-

Senator SUNUNU. We probably just scared Senator Mitch McCon-

Mr. GUNN. Yes. Anyway, there are three that I can think of right 

now that we’ve taken off. 

Senator SUNUNU. Three Rivers, the truncated Palmetto——
Mr. GUNN. Yes. 
Senator SUNUNU.—and a third——
Mr. GUNN. The Kentucky Cardinal. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  Oh,  there  are  two  different  Cardinals.  I  see.  I 

find that confusing, but—OK. 

The  numbers  that  I’ve  seen  show  that  overall  revenues  declined 
by  10  percent  in  2003,  by  8  percent  in  2004.  What  do  you  project 
overall revenues to be in 2005, relative to——

Mr. GUNN. I didn’t bring my budget for 2005, but they would——
Senator SUNUNU. Do you expect them to decline again? 
Mr. GUNN. No. They were basically flat. 
Senator SUNUNU. That’s your projection. 
Mr.  GUNN.  It  was  what—I  can  tell  you  what  we’ve  done  up  to 

now, but I don’t know—I didn’t bring my budget——

Senator  SUNUNU.  What,  in  your  mind,  is  the  reason  for  the  sig-
nificant decline in revenues over the last two and a half years? And 
why do you think that trend is going to stop in 2005? 

Mr. GUNN. I think that a couple of things happened; one of which 
was,  there  was  definitely  a  change  in  mix  from  higher-fare  tickets 
to  lower-fare,  to  coach.  The  mix  changed.  And,  obviously,  the  end-
point-to-endpoint  competition  from  the  low-fare  airlines  has  hurt 
us. 

Senator SUNUNU. And why do you think that——
Mr.  GUNN.  Yes,  that—and  the  other  thing,  just—the  Chairman 
just  reminded  me—I  don’t  know  what  revenue  figures  you’re  look-
ing at, but if it includes mail and express, we got out of that busi-
ness. Do your figures include mail and express? 

Senator  SUNUNU.  I  think,  in  the  Congressional  Research  Service 
documentation  that  they  put  together,  those  would  be  combined 
revenues——

Mr.  GUNN.  That’s  the  other  thing  that—if  you’re  looking  at  the 
total  revenue  per  train,  the  biggest  reason  for  the  drop  would  be 
getting out of mail and express.

Senator  SUNUNU.  And  why  did  you  get  out  of  mail  and  express? 
Mr. GUNN. Because we were losing money on that. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  And  what  is  the  impact,  then,  on  your  oper-
ating  loss?  Isn’t  your  operating  loss  either  the  same  or  slightly 
greater? 

Mr.  GUNN.  Yes—no,  the  first  year,  it  was  basically  a  wash,  be-
cause we—this is cash, now—it was a wash. I think—because there 
were  some  things  we  had  to  do  to  get  out  of  the  business—I  think 
we’ll  pick  up  two,  three,  four  million  dollars  a  year,  cash.  We  had 
to  write  off  a  lot  of  assets,  which  gave  us  a  big  bookkeeping  loss 
from that in 2004. But we were also able to sell—we’ve been fortu-
nate  that  we  were  able  to  sell  all  of  our  road  rail—or  we  had  two 
types  of—three,  really—three  types  of  basic  equipment,  and  our 
road  railers—we  were  able  to  sell  those  to  a  freight  railroad  and 
basically get rid of the paper that—because they were all financed. 
We’re  in  the  process  of  trying  to  reach  a  deal  to  sell—or  to  long-
term lease a bunch of our—the boxcars, and that will—we’ll recover 
cash  from  that.  And  we’ve  stored  about  40  locomotives  that  we’re 
in  the  process  of  trying  to  lease  to  other  operators.  We’re  close  to 
leasing a batch of them right now. So, that will help. That will gen-
erate  cash.  So,  there’s  a  series  of  things  that,  if  they  happen,  will 
help  us,  will  improve—will  have  a  very  positive  impact  on  us. 
And——

Senator  SUNUNU.  The  Federal  appropriation  was  $1.2  billion,  is 

that correct? 

Mr. GUNN. For the—1.2. 
Senator SUNUNU. And your request is $1.8 billion this year? 
Mr.  GUNN.  Yes.  But  that—let  me  just  say,  the  difference—it’s 
1.8, but if we had a credit facility to take care of our working cap-
ital, it drops to 1.6, approximately. In other words, the difference—
the  actual  difference,  in  terms  of  what  we  intend  to  spend  on  the 
railroad, is 400, and it’s all capital. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Well,  that  would  seem  to  reflect  an  insignifi-

cant change in your operating level. 

Mr.  GUNN.  Well,  our  goal  is  to  keep  the  operating  deficit  from 
growing, which is fair. You know, given the physical conditions we 
have, that’s a pretty ambitious goal, but we’ve been successful over 
the  last  couple  of  years.  Because  we  do  have  inflation.  I  mean, 
that—and  the  price  of  fuel  and  a  whole  series  of  things  that  are 
buffeting  us.  But  the  growth  in  the  request  is  capital.  It’s  to  begin 
to—it’s  to  repair—on  the  infrastructure  side,  it’s  to  repair  the 
Northeast  Corridor,  basically,  although  we  have  some  other  small 
projects  and  facilities  we  own.  On  the  equipment  side,  it’s  to  con-
tinue the overhaul of the existing fleet, which, I might add, we can 
thank  the  Lord  we  were  doing  it,  given  what  happened  with  these 
sellers. 

Senator SUNUNU. And you maintain that if you eliminated all of 
the  long-distance  train  routes,  you  would  only  cut  your  operating 
loss in half. 

Mr. GUNN. Yes, basically. That’s correct. You’d—but you’d cut an-
other  50  million  on  it  out  of  the  capital.  Now,  maybe  over  an  ex-
tended  period  of  time,  you’d  improve  that,  but  initially  you’d  have 
to  pony  up  the  C–2  labor  protection,  which  would  be  over—if  you 
did  what  we’re  talking  about,  would  be  over  a  billion  dollars.  And

you would have—you would offset that with savings, after you took 
the trains off and you had furloughed the people, of about 300. 

Senator  SUNUNU.  Anybody  know  what  the  discounted  value  of 

$300 million is, in perpetuity? 

Mr. GUNN. It depends on the—your—the rate you use. 
Senator SUNUNU. Probably quite a bit. 
I have one more question, Mr. Chairman, if I may. 
Mr.  Rosen,  you  mentioned  the  subsidy—the  overall  average  sub-
sidy level for the long-distance trains. Did you say it was $218 per 
passenger? I think that was the fully allocated——

Mr.  ROSEN.  That  sounds  right.  I  can  double-check  the  number  I 

was giving you. It was actually out of my written testimony. 

Mr. GUNN. Can I just make a comment? 
Mr. ROSEN. $214. 
Senator SUNUNU. Yes. 
Mr.  GUNN.  Just  a  factual  comment.  We  talk  about  subsidy  per 
passenger. And what happens when we make these calculations is, 
people  tend  to  divide  the  number  of  Amtrak  passengers  into  the 
subsidy.  In  fact,  there  are  hundreds  of  thousands  of  other  daily 
passengers who are on Amtrak track and under our wire, using our 
signals, that are involved, as well. So, you’ve got to be a little care-
ful with just dividing Amtrak passengers into subsidies——

Senator SUNUNU. I’m not sure I understand——
Mr. GUNN.—unless you segregate into——
Senator SUNUNU.—that. 
Mr. GUNN. Pardon? 
Senator  SUNUNU.  I  didn’t  understand  that.  We’re  talking  about 

the long-distance trains that——

Mr. GUNN. Oh, OK. 
Senator SUNUNU.—the 15——
Mr.  GUNN.  You’re  talking  about  intercity?  I’m  just—then  that’s 

Senator SUNUNU. And I wasn’t talking about the Northeast Cor-

probably a good——

ridor. 

the——

Mr. GUNN. I just wanted to point out that there are an awful lot 
of  passengers  on  our  facilities  that  use  Amtrak,  in  one  way  or  an-
other,  that  are  not  Amtrak  passengers.  In  fact,  there  are  probably 
four times the Amtrak passenger count for these other passengers. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  So,  you’re  talking  about  the  mass  transit,  say, 

Mr. GUNN. I’m talking about——
Senator SUNUNU.—MBTA in Massachusetts and——
Mr.  GUNN.  No,  I’m  talking  about—the  MBTA  is  the  Attleboro 
line.  There’s  a  small  number.  But  there’s  a—there  are  large  num-
bers  on  Jersey  Transit,  large  numbers  on  SEPTA,  in  Philadelphia, 
and  large  numbers  on  the  MARC  service,  between  Baltimore  and 
Washington. 

Senator SUNUNU. My question, Mr. Rosen, is, is there a compara-
tive  number,  either  per  mile  or  per  passenger,  for  the  Northeast 
Corridor, relative to the long-distance train? 

Mr.  ROSEN.  There  is.  And  while  I  don’t  have  it  at  my  fingertips, 

it’s roughly a breakeven-type number. 

Senator SUNUNU. You’re saying it’s roughly zero. 
Mr. ROSEN. Yes.

Mr.  MEAD.  Yes,  but  there’s  a  big  caveat  there.  An  enormous 
amount  of  money—billions—have  been  poured  into  the  Northeast 
Corridor  over  the  years  in  capital.  In  your  state,  that’s  not  so. 
We’re talking operating loss——

Senator  SUNUNU.  Well,  actually,  about  65  million,  I  think,  was 

what was put into the corridor. 

Mr. GUNN. And that was Maine’s money. 
Senator  SUNUNU.  Well,  no,  actually  it  was  Federal  taxpayer 

money. 

Mr. MEAD. My point is that——
Senator  SUNUNU.  I  think  if  the  State  of  Maine  had  had  to  put 

the money in, we wouldn’t be talking about the——

Mr.  MEAD.  The  only  point  I  was  trying  to  make  is,  when  you’re 
looking at this system, you’re coming up with these losses per pas-
senger.  When  you  look  at  the  Northeast  Corridor,  it  is  true  that, 
in  terms  of  operating  expenses,  they  are  roughly  breaking  even. 
When  you  throw  in  the  huge  capital  contribution  that  the  govern-
ment’s  made  over  the  years,  that  figure  changes  fairly  dramati-
cally,  and  you’ll  find  some  of  those  Northeast  Corridor  passengers 
are riding on the taxpayer’s back, as well.

Senator  SUNUNU.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you,  you’ve 

been very generous. 

Senator  LOTT.  Well,  thank  you  very  much.  I  look  forward  to 
working with this panel and others that are very much interested. 
I  hope  we  can  come  up  with  an  appropriate  solution  for  the  needs 
of the American people. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 
Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  for  holding  this  hearing  today  to  help  Members  of  the 
Subcommittee get a handle on the various proposals to reform America’s passenger 
rail system, Amtrak. 

While both the House and the Administration have recently put forth their ideas 
for  reforming  our  struggling  National  Passenger  Rail  Corporation,  my  colleagues 
and  I  here  in  the  Senate  continue  to  discuss  the  very  complex  issues  that  confront 
Amtrak. 

I must admit, I am disappointed that the Administration continues to attempt to 
eliminate Amtrak. Under the guise of reform, it seems that the Administration has 
provided us with a blueprint to break up Amtrak and leave the pieces in the hands 
of  the  states  and  private  corporations.  This  is  not  the  sort  of  reform  that  Amtrak 
needs.  It  certainly  has  its  flaws,  but  maintaining  a  national  passenger  rail  system 
is  in  America’s  national  interest.  It  reduces  congestion,  it  betters  environmental 
quality, and places fewer automobiles on the road. I do not advocate blindly throw-
ing  money  at  Amtrak,  but  efforts  must  be  made  to  not  only  maintain  the  existing 
assets but deliberately and carefully expand this service. 

Obviously, as a Senator from Maine, I have a great deal of interest in the viability 
of the Northeast Corridor. Not only its continued operation, but augmenting and im-
proving the Corridor. A significant part of the augmentation of the Corridor is hav-
ing  the  power  to  make  capital  improvements.  Without  this  power,  the  safety  of  our 
commuters  is  at  risk.  According  to  Amtrak’s  numbers,  the  Corridor  moved  over  14 
million  passengers  last  year,  easily  the  most  traveled  rail  corridor  in  America,  in-
cluding  freight  lines.  I  do  not  feel  that  we  can  neglect  Amtrak’s  ability  to  make 
these  safety  improvements,  and  urge  my  colleagues  to  take  this  into  account  as  we 
formulate a comprehensive reform package. 

In my state, we have an Amtrak route known as the Downeaster. It travels from 
Boston to Portland, and moves over a quarter of a million people annually. This has 
been a significant success in Maine, but our route is not financed through the yearly 
appropriations  fight  we  undertake  on  behalf  of  Amtrak.  Instead,  it  uses  a  Federal 
Highway  Program  entitled  CMAQ  ( see-mack ),  which  is  intended  to  relieve  conges-
tion  and  improve  air  quality.  It  seems  clear  to  me  that  passenger  rail  does  both  of 
these  things  as  good  or  better  than  any  other  mode  of  surface  transportation.  One 
thing  I  would  like  the  panelists  to  speak  to  is  how  to  fund  passenger  rail  in  non-
traditional  ways,  rather  than  leaning  on  the  General  Fund  and  potentially  exacer-
bate our already ballooning national debt. 

Lastly, the security of rail, both passenger and freight, is an often overlooked but 
very  real  concern  in  our  everyday  lives.  I  took  the  step  of  requesting  that  the  Gen-
eral Accounting Office examine the adequacy of our rail security in relation to inter-
national  standards  throughout  Europe  and  Asia.  They  are  due  to  complete  this 
study  in  a  few  short  months.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  panelists  to  what 
extent rail security has been taken into account in the various ideas that have been 
offered to initiate these reforms. 

The  future  of  passenger  rail  is  important,  not  only  to  the  Northeast  but,  as  gas 
prices climb and energy costs soar, throughout the country. If we can develop a tem-
plate  for  successful  passenger  rail  here  in  this  Subcommittee,  it  could  provide  an 
avenue to improve our Nation’s infrastructure and make our economy more efficient. 
I am hopeful we can begin to accomplish that today. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 
Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman.  I  appreciate  your  holding  this  hearing  and  I  welcome 

our witnesses from Amtrak and the Department of Transportation. 

Although  a  vast  majority  of  individuals  travel  by  car  or  plane  as  their  primary 
means  of  transportation,  still  each  year  millions  of  travelers  choose,  or  depend  on, 
intercity passenger rail for such purposes. 

Amtrak provides a valuable service for Oregonians who rely on passenger rail for 
traveling  across  the  state  and  up  and  down  the  west  coast.  Amtrak  operates  one 
short-distance  service  in  Oregon  (The  Cascades),  and  two  long-distance  services, 
(The  Coast  Starlight  and  The  Empire  Builder).  Of  Amtrak’s  total  annual  ridership 
of 25 million, ridership in Oregon is nearly 700,000 passengers per year. 

In  addition.  the  State  of  Oregon  is  one  of  13  states  currently  providing  funds  to 
support and maintain Amtrak’s rail service. Specifically, the State of Oregon spends 
$4.5  million  per  year  on  The  Cascades  train  line  that  runs  from  Eugene  to  Van-
couver,  BC.  These  annual  state  expenditures  have  greatly  contributed  toward  the 
success of operating Amtrak rail service in my State of Oregon. It is my belief that 
in  order  for  Amtrak  to  be  successful,  a  system  needs  to  be  developed  whereby  all 
states  with  intercity  passenger  rail  service  make  a  fair  contribution  to  support  its 
operations. 

As we all well know, funding for Amtrak has been an issue the Congress wrestles 
with  annually  and  Amtrak  has  continued  to  limp  along  year-to-year  with  just 
enough funding to maintain its operations. 

In  the  United  States  Senate,  I  have  supported  funding  for  Amtrak  and  believe 
intercity  passenger  rail  can  and  should  continue  as  a  viable  mode  of  travel  for  our 
citizens. 

However.  Amtrak’s  financial  house  is  in  a  shambles,  now  reaching  losses  exceed-
ing  $1  billion  per  year.  This  can  no  longer  continue.  Amtrak’s  operations  need  to 
be  assessed  and  reforms  implemented  in  order  to  sustain  the  long-term  viability  of 
intercity passenger train service. 

Reform  of  Amtrak  is  much  needed  and  I  welcome  a  constructive  and  candid  dis-
cussion of the issues so that, moving forward, passenger rail will be a more efficient 
mode of providing transportation for our citizens. 

I  look  forward  to  hearing  today’s  testimony  from  representatives  of  Amtrak  and 
the  Department  of  Transportation  and  their  proposals  to  address  the  state  of  Am-
trak’s passenger rail service. 
Thank you Mr. Chairman. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE TO

HON. KENNETH M. MEAD 

CMAQ Funding for the Downeaster: 
Background: 

I  wanted  to  ask  some  questions  about  the  Administration  funding  priorities  for 
passenger  rail.  As  a  Northeasterner,  the  operations  on  the  Northeast  Corridor  are 
vital  to  high-density  passenger  rail  network  that  operates  along  the  East  Coast.  In 
my  home  State  of  Maine,  our  route  from  Portland  to  Boston,  known  as  the 
Downeaster,  has  been  a  hard-earned  success.  However,  unlike  traditional  Amtrak 
programs, it is not funded through the typical Amtrak revenue streams. 

Through the efforts of the Maine delegation, we have been able to achieve funding 
via  the  Highway  Trust  Fund  for  operation  of  the  Downeaster.  More  precisely,  the 
CMAQ  (see-mack)  program,  which  as  you  know  is  used  to  alleviate  congestion  and 
improve  air  quality,  has  been  used  as  a  funding  source  for  our  Amtrak  service.  As 
I mentioned in my statement, the Downeaster transports over a quarter of a million 
people a year, and it has been a resounding success for commuters traveling to and 
from  metropolitan  Boston.  Yet  every  couple  of  years,  we  have  to  fight  the  Federal 
Highway Administration for a two-year waiver. 

Question  1.  Rather  than  constantly  fight  for  a  waiver  from  the  Federal  Highway 
Administration  on  an  annual  basis,  I  would  prefer  that  Maine  be  permitted  to  use 
CMAQ funds to achieve precisely what they were intended to do; relieve congestion. 
What  is  your  feeling  regarding  the  utilization  of  CMAQ  funds  to  operate  passenger 
rail and mass transit service? 

Answer.  CMAQ  is  an  $8.1  billion  program  under  TEA–21  intended  to  help  fund 
capital  investments  in  new  projects  and  programs  located  in  air  quality  nonattain-
ment  and  maintenance  areas  which  reduce  transportation-related  emissions.  Rail 
projects  qualify  for  these  funds  as  long  as  funds  are  used  in  or  in  close  proximity 
to  air  quality  nonattainment  and  maintenance  areas.  We  are  aware  that  Maine 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  14:17 May 02, 2006 Jkt 026844 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\26844.TXT JACKF PsN: JACKF

65

launched  its  Downeaster  service  with  $51.7  million  in  CMAQ  funds  (along  with 
state  bonds  and  Taxpayer  Relief  Act  Funds)  for  capital  improvements  to  track  and 
signals  and  stations.  CMAQ  funds  have  been  used  by  other  states  for  a  variety  of 
freight and passenger rail services. New York State has spent $100 million or more 
in  CMAQ  funds  on  rail  improvements  to  support  passenger  service  on  the  Empire 
Corridor between NYC and Schenectady. 

CMAQ funds can be used for up to 3 years to cover operating losses during a sys-
tem startup period, after which other sources of funding must be used if the service 
is  to  be  continued.  Thus  the  program,  as  currently  defined,  is  not  intended  to  pro-
vide  long-term  state  support  for  operating  losses  on  passenger  rail  service.  CMAQ 
annual  appropriations  since  FY  2002  averaged  $1.4  billion  a  year.  The  operating 
subsidy  requirements  for  transit  and  intercity  passenger  rail  far  exceed  this  level 
of  funding,  and,  if  used  to  fund  operating  losses  would  leave  nothing  for  capital 
projects.  Operating  subsidy  requirements  might  better  be  addressed  in  new  legisla-
tion  that  explicitly  recognizes  Federal  and  State  agreements  on  funding  rail  oper-
ating subsidies, such as we have suggested in our testimony. 
Alternative Funding Sources for Retaining Amtrak 
Background: 

While  no  one  here  looks  forward  to  another  fight  with  the  Appropriations  Com-
mittee  about  funding  for  Amtrak,  it  strikes  me  that  the  most  recent  proposals  to 
restructure Amtrak revolve around continued utilization of the appropriations proc-
ess, which seems to me to be spinning one’s wheels. Maine uses a unique but effec-
tive  way  of  funding  its  operations  for  our  Amtrak  route,  and  I  wonder  that  rel-
egating the survival of Amtrak to congressional appropriators, and farther down the 
line to states, seems to deflect the problem rather than attempt to solve it. 

There  must  be  at  least  a  few  suggestions  to  creatively  finance  the  passenger  rail 

sector, and Amtrak in particular. 

Question  2.  Does  the  panel  have  any  ideas  on  using  alternative  or  nontraditional 
sources of funding for passenger rail? Has their been any examination of developing 
financing outside the realm of receiving a check from the Federal Government every 
year? 

Answer. Since 2001, both the House and the Senate have proposed legislation that 
would establish a long-term funding source for intercity passenger rail development. 
Funding  recommendations  in  these  proposals  have  centered  on  the  issuance  of  tax-
credit and tax-exempt bonds as a long-term funding source for corridor development. 
These  proposals  have  not  been  enacted  primarily  because  of  the  resistance  to  in-
creasing U.S. debt financing and the negative impacts on the budget. Previous pro-
posals focused on the use of highway trust fund monies and a  1⁄2-cent gas tax which 
also failed to generate sufficient support.

DAVID L. GUNN 

Question  1.  Rather  than  constantly  fight  for  a  waiver  from  the  Federal  Highway 
Administration  on  an  annual  basis,  I  would  prefer  that  Maine  be  permitted  to  use 
CMAQ funds to achieve precisely what they were intended to do: relieve congestion. 
What  is  your  feeling  regarding  the  utilization  of  CMAQ  funds  to  operate  passenger 
rail and mass transit service? 

Answer.  Amtrak  believes  that  states  should  have  the  flexibility  to  utilize  their 
Federal  highway  funds  for  whichever  mode  of  transportation,  including  intercity 
passenger  rail,  best  meets  the  states’  transportation  needs  and  other  policy  objec-
tives, such as congestion mitigation and improving air quality. The Downeaster serv-
ice  to  Maine—which  operates  parallel  to  the  congested  Maine  and  New  Hampshire 
Turnpikes,  and  has  carried  nearly  one  million  passengers  since  its  inception  in  De-
cember  2001—illustrates  how  new  state-initiated  intercity  passenger  rail  services 
can provide modal alternatives in congested highway corridors.

Question 2. Does the panel have any ideas on using alternative or non-traditional 
sources of funding for passenger rail? Has there been any examination of developing 
financing outside the realm of receiving a check from the Federal Government every 
year? 

Answer. While intercity passenger rail service cannot be provided without govern-
ment funding, Amtrak believes that new funding mechanisms—including private in-
vestment—are necessary if intercity passenger rail is to fulfill its potential. Indeed, 
the lack of a reliable, predictable Federal funding source like other modes is a major 
impediment to attracting non-Federal matching funds. Private investors, states and 
local governments are reluctant to commit their funds to support intercity passenger

rail  when  the  level  of  Federal  funding  it  will  receive  next  year—and,  for  that  mat-
ter, whether it will continue to exist—is so uncertain. Thus, it is critical that a Fed-
eral funding program for intercity passenger rail, like the programs that fund other 
modes, provide a long term and predictable level of funding. 

Amtrak, and the states who will be the ultimate purchasers of intercity passenger 
rail  services  under  Amtrak’s  Strategic  Reform  Initiatives,  would  be  open  to  innova-
tive  approaches  that  could  help  meet  some  of  the  funding  needs  of  intercity  pas-
senger  rail,  particularly  with  regard  to  corridor  development  and  the  acquisition  of 
new equipment. Such approaches might include bond financing, a multi-modal user 
fee,  and  the  creation  of  a  special  purpose  entity  to  acquire  and  finance  new  equip-
ment. Amtrak looks forward to working with Congress, the Administration, and the 
states to advance such initiatives.

Question 3. Who determines the extent of the inspections of the Acela Trains, and 
the  Amtrak  fleet  in  general?  Do  you  feel  that  the  inspections  are  lacking  in  thor-
oughness?  Is  this  part  of  a  pattern  of  overlooking  or  simply  missing  mechanical 
problems  in  Amtrak’s  fleet?  How  can  you  reassure  the  public  that  these  oversights 
will not continue? 

Answer. Every maintenance inspection performed on all equipment owned by Am-
trak including the Acela is developed to comply with the Federal Railroad Adminis-
tration’s  regulations  in  Volume  49  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulation.  The  Consor-
tium of Bombardier Transportation of Canada and Alstom of France through a sub-
sidiary 
company—the  Northeast  Corridor  Maintenance  Services  Company 
(NECMSC)—are  responsible  for  inspecting  and  maintaining  the  Acela  trainsets  in 
accordance  with  Federal  Regulations  and  the  original  equipment  manufacturer’s 
recommended  practices.  The  Federal  regulation  is  quite  extensive  in  encompassing 
every  major  component  on  both  passenger  cars  and  locomotives  to  ensure  the  high-
est  degree  of  safety  for  the  traveling  public.  Amtrak’s  philosophy  has  always  been 
where  possible  to  increase  the  safety  margin  in  our  inspection  process  above  that 
which is outlined by regulatory requirements.

Question 1. What steps are you taking in order to improve operational efficiencies 

at Amtrak? 

Answer.  Amtrak  is  undertaking  and  has  initiated  a  number  of  efforts  to  improve 
operational efficiencies. We have taken advantage of technological improvements in 
our  reservations  system,  closed  down  one  of  our  reservation  call  centers,  exited  the 
mail  and  express  business  and  as  a  result  eliminated  or  truncated  four  routes.  In 
addition, we are streamlining procurement of long lead time material for our fleets, 
outsourcing component renewal and remanufacture where practical, increasing utili-
zation of employee resources as well as eliminating unnecessary fleet configurations. 
We are also continuing our current initiative to standardize our maintenance inspec-
tion procedures across fleet types. This effort will reduce our out of service time for 
planned  maintenance  activities  while  increasing  system  reliability  and  overall  fleet 
availability.

Question 2. What are your plans for the routes that are the biggest financial drain 
on your organization? Would you consider reintroducing routes, such as the Pioneer 
Line,  that  have  been  previously  discontinued  if  these  routes  are  deemed  to  provide 
more benefit to consumers and businesses than existing routes? 

Answer.  The  proposals  and  planned  actions  in  Amtrak’s  Strategic  Reform  Initia-

tives include:

• requiring  all  users  of  the  Amtrak-owned  Northeast  Corridor,  whose  infrastruc-
ture  requirements  are  the  largest  component  of  Amtrak’s  capital  budget  re-
quest, to pay their full proportionate share of the Corridor’s operating and cap-
ital costs;

• establishing  performance  thresholds  for  long  distance  trains,  and  discontinuing 
trains not meeting these thresholds absent state (or additional Federal) support; 
and

• a variety of actions to improve the financial performance of all routes, including 
changes  in  food  service,  selective  outsourcing,  and  limited  changes  in  certain 
statutory  provisions  that  impose  higher  costs  on  Amtrak  than  on  its  competi-
tors.

67

The  initiation  of  new  routes  is  a  major  corporate  decision  that  requires  action  by 
Amtrak’s  Board  and  approval  by  the  Secretary  of  Transportation.  This  issue  is  ad-
dressed in Mr. Laney’s response to the similar question you have posed to him.

Question  3.  Budgets  at  both  the  Federal  and  State  levels  are  being  stretched  in 
all directions. Are you supportive of having all states with Amtrak service shoulder 
a fair and equitable share of their operational and capital costs? 

Answer. As indicated in its Strategic Reform Initiatives, Amtrak believes that all 
states should provide a fair and comparable share of the operating and capital costs 
associated with the short distance corridor trains that serve them. Amtrak plans to 
transition all corridor routes to state coverage of fully allocated operating losses (ex-
cluding interest and depreciation), and equitable charges for usage of Amtrak-owned 
equipment,  over  a  four  year  period  beginning  in  FY  2008.  Critical  to  accomplishing 
this  transition,  however,  is  the  enactment,  prior  to  the  start  of  that  transition,  of 
a  Federal  matching  grant  program  under  which  all  states  will  be  able  to  leverage 
their  capital  investments  in  intercity  passenger  rail  on  a  basis  comparable  to  the 
Federal match that is provided for other modes.

Question  4.  In  2010,  the  Olympics  will  be  held  in  Vancouver,  BC.  The  Olympics 
will  draw  scores  of  people  to  the  region  during  that  time.  As  a  result,  I  anticipate 
this  will  cause  much  traffic  congestion,  especially  on  I–5.  Are  you  willing  to  make 
the  Cascades  a  priority  so  that  adequate  rail  infrastructure  exists  in  anticipation 
of the 2010 Olympics? 

Answer.  The  Cascades  service  to  Vancouver,  BC  is  supported  by  the  State  of 
Washington, and Oregon provides funding for the portion of the Cascades route be-
tween Eugene and Portland. The rail infrastructure over which it operates is owned 
by private freight railroads. 

Decisions about infrastructure investments on state supported corridor routes are 
made  by  the  states  involved.  Currently,  the  states  are  also  the  primary—and  in 
many cases exclusive—funding source for investments in corridor infrastructure. 

Because there is no Federal matching program in place to match state capital in-
vestments  in  intercity  passenger  rail,  the  States  of  Oregon  and  Washington  have 
funded  the  vast  majority  of  the  expenditures  to  date  to  upgrade  the  Cascades  cor-
ridor  and  extend  service  to  Eugene  and  Vancouver,  BC.  In  its  2004  Strategic  Plan, 
Amtrak designated the Cascades corridor as a ‘‘Tier I’’ corridor based upon the read-
iness of the states of Oregon and Washington to make additional investments in cor-
ridor  development  as  soon  as  a  Federal  matching  program  for  intercity  passenger 
rail  is  enacted.  An  important  underpinning  of  Amtrak’s  plan  to  transition  states  to 
full  operational  cost  responsibility  for  and  control  of  all  corridor  services  is  the  en-
actment of such a program prior to FY 2008. 

That  said,  we  have  been  contacted  by  some  local  communities  in  the  Pacific 
Northwest who would like to work with us to provide adequate mobility to and from 
the  Olympics.  We  intend  to  work  with  these  groups  and  are  open  to  their  sugges-
tions  and  ideas  on  how  we  can  improve  and  expand  service  during  the  Olympics. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. GORDON H. SMITH TO

DAVID M. LANEY, ESQ. 

Question.  My  understanding  is  that  under  Amtrak’s  proposal,  states  will  be  re-
sponsible for filling funding gaps for long distance routes such as the Empire Build-
er that operates in Oregon. How will each state’s financial obligation be calculated? 
Will  you  consider  and  analyze  the  possibility  of  reintroducing  previously  discon-
tinued  routes  such  as  the  Pioneer  Line  if  they  prove  to  have  a  more  favorable  rev-
enue-to-cost ratio than some existing intercity passenger rail lines? 

Answer.  Under  Amtrak’s  proposal,  states  will  be  required  to  provide  operating 
funding for long distance trains only if a particular train fails to meet the minimum 
performance  thresholds  that  Amtrak  is  in  the  process  of  establishing.  In  that  case, 
state  funding  would  be  required  to  cover  the  ‘‘gap’’  between  the  minimum  perform-
ance  threshold  and  the  train’s  actual  operating  losses.  Whether  to  provide  funding, 
and  how  much  of  the  required  funding  would  be  provided  by  each  participating 
state, would be up to the individual states involved. 

Amtrak  intends  to  operate  a  long  distance  train  network  that  optimizes  cost  effi-
ciency and public benefits within the limits of available Federal funding and equip-
ment.  Consistent  with  these  objectives  and  applicable  law,  Amtrak  would  consider 
operating long distance trains on new or different routes if:

(i) a market analysis indicates that a new route would meet minimum perform-
ance thresholds (with state financial support if necessary), in which case a more 
detailed  study  of  comparative  revenues  and  operating  costs,  route  termination/

start up costs and availability of equipment, would be the next step in the anal-
ysis; and
(ii) the new route has adequate infrastructure—particularly rail line capacity—
to enable Amtrak to provide reliable service (or a state or group of states is pre-
pared to fund the necessary infrastructure improvements, utilizing the available 
Federal match if appropriate).

Question 1. Do you fully support the plan developed by the Board? Are there areas 

that need further improvement or refinement? 

Answer. I fully support the Board’s plan. 
The  Strategic  Reform  Initiatives  that  Amtrak  has  laid  out  are  merely  the  first 
step in a multi-year planning and implementation process. A large number of refine-
ments  will  be  required  as  we  develop  the  more  comprehensive  strategic  plan  that 
we  expect  to  issue  in  early  Fall,  and  as  we  begin  to  take  actions  to  implement  the 
initiatives  we  have  proposed.  The  involvement  of  other  stakeholders  is  particularly 
critical  as  the  proposals  that  we  have  sketched  out  in  the  Strategic  Reform  Initia-
tives are refined, fleshed out and revised. 

Amtrak management and the Board put a lot of work into the plan and we believe 
it  is  a  serious  proposal  and  answers  the  call  from  the  Administration  and  others 
about what shape reform of Amtrak should take.

Question 2. What is the single most important tool Amtrak needs to be successful 

Answer. Adequate, predictable funding. Funding of state of good repair needs can 
no  longer  be  deferred,  and  a  Federal  match,  comparable  to  that  for  other  modes, 
of state funded corridor development projects is essential for intercity rail passenger 
service to begin to fulfill its potential.

in the future? 

Question  3.  Do  you  believe  outsourcing  certain  functions  will  significantly  lower 

operating costs? What have been your experiences with outsourcing so far? 

Answer.  To  an  extent  outsourcing  can  reduce  our  costs  and  where  applicable  we 
will explore those opportunities. Amtrak has outsourced selected activities on many 
occasions with mixed results. While cost is certainly an important consideration care 
must be taken to acknowledge the other aspects associated with an outsourcing ven-
ture; specifications, oversight, Federal procurement requirements and the like which 
restrict  and  occasionally  eliminate  the  most  viable  candidate  leaving  you  with  an 
alternative less capable than existing internal resources.

Question 4. Is Amtrak’s security funding needs incorporated into the Board’s pro-
posal?  Does  the  $1.8  billion  requested  for  this  year  include  any  significant  funding 
for security? 

Answer.  Security  funding  in  the  amount  of  $13.3  million  is  included  in  Amtrak’s 
$1.8  billion  requested  for  FY06.  In  addition,  the  Police  &  Security  Department’s 
FY06 operating budget is projected at about $35 million.

Question  5.  Amtrak  is  facing  significant  on-time  performance  challenges,  espe-
cially  for  long  distance  trains.  What  is  the  major  cause  of  delay  for  these  trains? 
How do we address this delay? For long distance trains to become better performers 
economically, as the Board’s plan suggests it hopes to accomplish, won’t service reli-
ability and on-time performance have to be improved? 

Answer. Amtrak long distance trains operate beyond the Amtrak-owned Northeast 
Corridor  using  tracks  owned  by  other,  ‘‘host’’  railroads.  Most  delays  to  Amtrak 
trains  operating  off  Amtrak-owned  tracks  are  attributable  to  host  railroads.  Each 
minute  of  delay  to  an  Amtrak  train  is  assigned  a  cause,  and  each  cause  is  the  re-
sponsibility  of  either  Amtrak,  the  host  railroad,  or  third  parties.  On  non-Amtrak 
owned  lines  during  the  first  half  of  Fiscal  Year  2005,  host  railroad-responsible 
delays accounted for 78 percent of all delays, followed by Amtrak-responsible delays 
at  16  percent  and  third  party  delays  at  6  percent.  Of  delays  caused  by  host  rail-
roads, Freight Train Interference accounted for 29 percent of total delays to Amtrak 
trains;  temporary  speed  restrictions  (‘‘Slow  Orders’’)  accounted  for  16  percent;  Sig-
nal-related  Delays  11  percent;  Passenger  Train  Interference  10  percent;  Routing  6 
percent; Maintenance of Way 3 percent; Commuter Train Interference 3 percent. 

Amtrak is addressing these delays using several approaches: (1) Amtrak operating 
personnel work continuously on a real-time basis with host railroads to keep trains 
moving; (2) Amtrak funds personnel located in the dispatching centers of major host 
railroads  to  monitor  and  improve  Amtrak  train  performance;  (3)  Amtrak  offers  the 
host  railroads  financial  incentives  for  good  performance  and  penalties  for  poor  per-

formance; and (4) Amtrak is offering a new program of funds to match host railroad 
and  state  investments  in  small,  targeted  infrastructure  projects  to  remove  bottle-
necks  and  improve  performance.  Amtrak  also  supports  Federal  efforts  to  fund  rail 
infrastructure.  The  primary  requirement  for  improving  on-time  performance  is  cap-
ital investment in rail infrastructure to match rail capacity with demand for freight 
and passenger traffic. 

On  time  performance  is  one  of  the  primary  drivers  of  Amtrak  customer  satisfac-
tion. Therefore, improvements in service reliability and on-time performance are key 
contributors to revenue growth and improved economic performance. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

DAVID M. LANEY, ESQ. 

Question 1. What are the main differences between your plan and the Administra-

tion’s plan? 

Answer. The Administration’s plan would terminate Federal operating funding for 
Amtrak’s  15  long  distance  trains.  Amtrak’s  plan  proposes  to  establish  performance 
thresholds that each long distance train would have to meet by the end of a transi-
tion  period,  during  which  time  various  actions  would  be  taken  to  improve  financial 
performance.  At  the  end  of  this  period,  long  distance  trains  that  fall  short  of  these 
performance  thresholds  would  be  discontinued  unless  states  or  Congress  decided  to 
fund  the  ‘‘gap’’  between  individual  trains’  operating  losses  and  the  minimum  per-
formance threshold. 

The  Administration’s  plan  proposes  to  turn  over  the  Northeast  Corridor  (‘‘NEC’’) 
infrastructure  to  a  compact  of  eight  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia.  Amtrak’s 
plan  would  not,  at  least  at  this  point,  separate  NEC  assets  from  NEC  operations. 
(We do propose—and have already begun—to separate NEC infrastructure manage-
ment  and  NEC  operations  for  planning,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting  and 
analysis purposes.) 

The  Administration’s  plan  contemplates  that  the  Federal  match  for  state  capital 
investments  in  intercity  passenger  rail  would  be  no  greater  than  50  percent.  Am-
trak’s  plan  contemplates  a  Federal  matching  program  for  state  investments  that 
provide  a  stimulus  comparable  to  that  provided  for  other  transportation  modes  at 
this stage in their development (e.g., 80/20). 

The  Administration’s  plan  is  silent  in  its  proposal  as  to  what  level  of  funding 
would  be  provided  for  continued  intercity  passenger  rail  operations  and  capital 
needs  or  for  bringing  the  Northeast  Corridor  to  a  state  of  good  repair,  authorizing 
only  ‘‘such  sums  as  may  be  necessary.’’  Amtrak’s  plan  spells  out  in  detail  the  level 
of funding that Amtrak believes is required for these purposes. 

Both the Administration’s and Amtrak’s plans contemplate competition in the pro-
vision  of  intercity  passenger  rail  services  to  reduce  costs  and  improve  service  qual-
ity.  However,  the  Administration’s  plan  does  not  address  fundamental  issues  nec-
essary  to  position  Amtrak  on  an  equal  footing  with  all  other  operators/service  pro-
viders  in  certain  respects,  or  provide  intercity  passenger  rail  operators  with  the 
labor flexibility that other industries have. To address these issues, Amtrak has pro-
posed  that  all  new  intercity  passenger  rail  employees  be  covered  by  Social  Security 
rather  than  by  the  Railroad  Retirement  system,  and  that  labor  agreements  termi-
nate when they expire.

Question 2. An essential element of your plan is dedicated, multi-year federal cap-
ital  match  program.  Is  the  Board’s  plan  possible  without  this  capital  match  pro-
gram? 

Answer.  No.  The  vision  of  intercity  passenger  rail’s  future  underlying  Amtrak’s 
plan—and  in  the  proposals  advanced  by  the  Administration  and  various  members 
of Congress—requires an adequate federal capital match program. Many of the crit-
ical elements in the Amtrak’s plan—state assumption of the full operating losses of 
all corridor trains by 2011, corridor development, and increasing the public benefits 
from  (and  therefore  public  support  for)  intercity  passenger  rail—depend  upon  the 
availability  to  states  of  federal  matched  funding  by  which  they  can  leverage  their 
investment  in  intercity  passenger  rail  as  they  do  with  other  modes.  A  match  pro-
gram would also allow a leveraging of federal investment in intercity passenger rail 
with new state funds.

Question 3. Will the metrics established to judge long distance trains include both 

economic and societal and mobility benefits? 

Answer.  The  metrics  for  long  distance  trains  that  the  Board  will  establish  have 
not  yet  been  finalized.  Based  on  the  Board’s  discussions  to  date,  I  anticipate  that 
financial  performance  will  be  the  primary  criterion,  but  that  other  factors  relating 
to public and transportation benefits will also be taken into account.

70

Question  4.  What  sort  of  state  operating  support  do  you  anticipate  the  long  dis-
tance  trains  will  require?  Are  you  proposing  that  Amtrak  should  cover  some  max-
imum loss per train and that the states will have to pick up the rest for operations 
that lose more than that maximum amount? 

Answer. Amtrak proposes that the Federal Government continue to cover the op-
erating  losses  of  long  distance  trains  that  meet  performance  metric  thresholds.  For 
trains  that  do  not  meet  these  thresholds,  states  (or  Congress,  if  it  chooses)  would 
have  the  option  of  covering  the  ‘‘gap’’  between  the  minimum  performance  threshold 
and actual operating losses. If such coverage is not provided, the trains will be dis-
continued.

Question 5. Can the Corporation survive on a funding level of $1.2 billion? 
Answer.  As  stated  in  the  Amtrak  Strategic  Reform  Initiatives  and  FY06  Grant 
Request,  ‘‘Amtrak  cannot  continue  to  operate  at  the  current  funding  level  of  $1.2 
billion  in  FY06.’’  From  a  $1.2  billion  funding  level,  Amtrak  would  first  need  to  re-
serve $278 million for debt service on its legacy debt. Second, $560 million is needed 
as  operating  support  for  the  current  base  of  operations.  This  leaves  a  balance  of 
$362 million for all capital programs. The FY06 requirement for capital needs which 
represent  ongoing  state-of-good-repair  primarily  for  equipment  and  infrastructure 
totals  $959  million.  Of  this  $172  million  is  planned  to  be  supported  by  non-Federal 
funding including from states and transit agencies with the balance of $787 million 
required  from  federal  funding.  It  is  not  possible  to  keep  both  equipment  and  infra-
structure  in  a  state  of  good  repair  with  less  than  half  the  funding  required,  $362 
million.

Question  6.  You  mentioned  a  desire  to  change  the  laws  governing  contract  nego-
tiations and retirement plans for Amtrak employees. What types of changes are you 
looking  for?  Are  you  suggesting  that  these  laws  should  be  changed  for  the  entire 
railroad industry or just Amtrak? If just for Amtrak, why should Amtrak be treated 
differently than other freight or commuter railroads? 

Answer. With regard to contract negotiations, the change we are looking for is to 
amend  the  Railway  Labor  Act  (‘‘RLA’’)  to  provide  that  the  termination  date  of  an 
agreement  is  the  date  that  Amtrak  can  impose  new  agreement  terms  or  the  union 
may  engage  in  self-help.  Without  this  the  terms  of  an  agreement  without  a  nego-
tiated change continue in effect ‘‘forever.’’ We are also seeking to make new intercity 
passenger rail employees subject to Social Security rather than the Railroad Retire-
ment  Tax  Act  (‘‘RRTA’’);  current  employees  would  continue  to  be  covered  by  the 
RRTA. 

These  changes  should  be  limited  to  intercity  passenger  rail  operators  and  their 
labor unions only. The Alaska Railroad—the other current operator of intercity pas-
senger  rail  service  in  the  United  States—is  not  subject  to  the  RLA  or  the  RRTA, 
and  new  passenger  rail  operators  who  compete  for  contracts  to  operate  intrastate 
corridor  services  currently  operated  by  Amtrak  would  likely  not  be  subject  to  these 
statutes  either.  Commuter  railroads  are  governed  by  provisions  of  the  RLA  regard-
ing  the  contract  negotiating  process.  These  differ  from  the  provisions  applicable  to 
freight railroads that also currently apply to Amtrak. 

There  is  no  reason  why  Amtrak,  which  is  subject  to  statutory,  congressional  and 
administration  mandates  to  reform  its  operations  and  reduce  its  costs,  should  be 
subject  to  all  of  the  statutory  provisions  applicable  to  privately  owned  freight  rail-
roads. Amtrak’s proposals would create a ‘‘level playing field’’ in which all operators 
of intercity passenger rail service operators would be subject to the same laws.

Question  7.  The  Board  is  advocating  very  robust  competition  for  the  services  it 
now  solely  provides.  I  can’t  think  of  many  other  private  companies  that  are  asking 
for  competition  in  their  marketplace.  Does  this  call  for  competition  conflict  with 
your fiduciary responsibilities to the Corporation? 

Answer. Amtrak is not sustainable as currently funded. The company cannot con-
tinue  to  operate  the  way  it  does  today  with  the  current  level  of  Federal  financial 
support,  which  in  FY  2005  is  approximately  $200  million  less  than  projected  losses 
(a  gap  we  are  closing  with  working  capital  that  will  soon  be  depleted).  For  Amtrak 
to  avoid  insolvency,  support  for  Amtrak’s  funding  needs  must  be  obtained  from 
those who have advocated significant reforms in the provision of intercity passenger 
rail  services,  including  the  Administration  and  many  Members  of  Congress.  The 
Board  believes  that  the  introduction  and  development  of  competition  is  one  of  the 
steps  necessary  to  achieve  this  objective.  Competition  introduces  market  incentives 
for  operating  efficiencies  and  service  quality  that  are  not  as  pronounced  as  long  as 
Amtrak  is  the  sole  provider.  Competition  should  enhance  Amtrak’s  performance  at 
virtually all levels. It also represents an essential component of proposals from Con-
gress  and  the  Administration  and  a  key  to  funding  levels  that  will  enable  Amtrak 
to continue its operations.

Question  1.  Has  the  Board  considered  taking  any  actions  to  cut  routes  to  save 

money immediately? If so, how much money could be saved? 

Answer. The Board continues to evaluate many cost saving actions including cut-
ting routes. In fact, for FY05 the Board approved the shut down of the Three Rivers 
route  and  the  truncation  of  the  Palmetto  route.  However,  meaningful  reductions  in 
operating  expense  would  require  widespread  route  and  service  actions  related  to 
long distance service requiring notice, an orderly shut down and supplemental fund-
ing  for  the  significant  restructuring  costs.  Restructuring  costs  include  those  related 
to contractual labor and financing agreements. Instead the Board supports a longer 
term  evaluation  process  with  a  set  of  benefit  performance  metrics  to  be  used  to 
evaluate and determine the future of each long distance train. This process includes 
working  to  improve  performance  including  state  contribution  where  required  to 
achieve  performance  thresholds  or  termination  beginning  in  FY08  for  routes  that 
continue to fall short.

Question 2. How do you believe that proposing additional competition will aid the 
bottom line of the company to which you owe a fiduciary duty as Board Chairman? 
Answer. Amtrak is not sustainable as currently funded. The company cannot con-
tinue  to  operate  the  way  it  does  today  with  the  current  level  of  Federal  financial 
support,  which  in  FY  2005  is  approximately  $200  million  less  than  projected  losses 
(a  gap  we  are  closing  with  working  capital  that  will  soon  be  depleted).  For  Amtrak

Question 1. In your testimony, you note that the freight railroads have expressed 
considerable  concerns  about  the  concept  of  extending  Amtrak’s  statutory  access  to 
other  railroads  and  to  new  operators.  Have  you  considered  any  alternative  ap-
proaches  such  as  having  Amtrak  manage  the  operations  with  the  freight  railroads 
and provide operating employees to other service providers on a contract basis, simi-
lar  to  what  Amtrak  currently  provides  for  private  trains  or  the  service  that  the 
Alaska Railroad provides for some of the cruise operations in that state?

Question 2. Your testimony suggests crating non-matching formula grants to serve 
as  baseline  Federal  support  for  the  states  to  cover  long  distance  and  corridor  train 
operating losses and capital costs. If passenger rail funding needs exceed any state’s 
apportionment  of  formula  funds,  as  it  likely  would  be  the  funding  levels  decrease 
over  time  per  your  recommendation,  then  a  state  would  have  to  pay  for  the  dif-
ference. 

Do  you  support  allowing  states  to  use  some  of  their  other  Federal  transportation 
funds,  perhaps  provided  through  the  Congestions  Mitigation  and  Air  Quality  pro-
gram (CMAQ), the surface transportation program, or the 5311(f) intercity bus pro-
gram to help cover those additional costs?

Question  3.  Can  you  discuss  some  of  the  costs  that  might  be  associated  with  try-

ing to restructure Amtrak through bankruptcy?

Question  4.  Do  you  have  examples  of  other  Federal  transportation  programs  that 
require states to collectively provide matching funds to cover operating costs? What 
are the challenges associated with this approach? 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

HON. JEFFREY L. ROSEN 

Question  1.  Does  the  Administration  still  support  restructuring  Amtrak  through 

bankruptcy?

Question 2. You’ve said that the Administration will only support Amtrak funding 
if  it’s  accompanied  by  ‘‘significant’’  reform.  Given  the  busy  schedule  for  this  year, 
it is possible, even likely, that final passage of an Amtrak reauthorization bill could 
occur after we have to approve funding for Amtrak for FY 2006. 

Will the Administration support funding to maintain Amtrak while Congress com-

pletes its work on Amtrak reauthorization?

Question  3.  Greyhound  has  recently  withdrawn  significant  services  in  the  West 
and Southwest, while many airlines have cut or eliminated service to many smaller 
cities  and  airports.  Some  of  these  regions  and  communities  are  served  by  our  long 
distance  trains,  which  Secretary  Mineta  has  described  as  ‘‘trains  nobody  rides  be-
tween cities nobody wants to travel between.’’

If  we  eliminate  the  train  in  these  areas,  what  are  people  with  mobility  needs  to 

do in these communities who can’t or don’t drive?

Question  4.  Do  you  generally  agree  with  the  DOT  IG’s  assessment  of  Amtrak’s 

condition and financial needs?

Question 5. How many Amtrak Board meetings has the Secretary attended during 

his tenure?

Question  6.  In  your  testimony,  you  say  that  Federal  funds  don’t  support  transit 
operations,  but  that  is  incorrect.  The  Federal  transit  program  does  support  oper-
ating  costs  for  smaller  transit  properties  and  other  programs  including  intercity 
buses.  Why  is  providing  operational  support  for  transit  acceptable,  but  not  pas-
senger rail?

Question  7.  Do  you  believe  that  we  should  measure  the  success  of  transit  oper-
ations  and  intercity  passenger  rail  by  the  same  yardstick?  Does  Amtrak’s  fare  box 
recovery  figures  compare  favorably  with  the  average  rail  transit  property  figures? 
Is Amtrak not public transit?

Question 8. The Administration, through its SAFETEA proposal supports and has 
actually proposed strengthening the 5311(f) program, which provides both operating 
and  capital  support  for  intercity  bus  operations?  Why  has  the  Administration  not 
proposed a similar program for passenger rail?

Question 9. I understand that under the 5311(f) program, many states can’t even 
come up with the 50 percent match required to subsidize intercity bus service. Isn’t 
it likely that very few states could then provide a 100 percent match as you propose, 
requiring for intercity rail operations?

Question  10.  Every  major  Federal  capital  grant  transportation  program  features 
some  sort  of  dedicated,  multi-year  nature  of  capital  projects.  Why  doesn’t  the  Ad-
ministration support this approach for passenger rail?

Question 11. In your testimony, you note that Amtrak consumes 9 percent of dis-
cretionary  transportation  spending.  But,  isn’t  most  of  our  Federal  transportation 
spending non-discretionary? What percentage of all transportation funding does the 
Federal Government spend on Amtrak annually?

Question  12.  Is  it  true  that  the  Department  of  Transportation’s  FY  2006  budget 

proposal to the Office of Management and Budget for Amtrak was $1.4 billion?

Question 13. Secretary Mineta has been quoted as saying that if states won’t pay 
for service, then trains shouldn’t open their doors while traveling though that state. 
We  currently  have  an  example  of  this  with  the  State  of  New  Hampshire,  where  it 
doesn’t  contribute  to  the  successful  Downeaster  Service  provided  by  the  State  of 
Maine.  Does  the  Secretary  support  eliminating  all  stops  in  New  Hampshire  even 
though  doing  so  would  be  significantly  impact  the  ridership  and  financial  perform-
ance of the service?

Question 14. The Administration has proposed no funding for the Next Generation 
High  Speed  Rail  program.  Does  the  Administration  believe  that  highspeed  rail 
projects are no longer viable? 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO

HON. JEFFREY A. ROSEN 

Question  1.  You  stated  you  believe  it  is  not  inconsistent  for  the  Administration 
to provide Federal operating assistance for intercity buses because smaller amounts 
(than  Amtrak’s  Federal  operating  assistance  grant)  are  involved.  Why  does  the  Ad-
ministration believe in principle that federal operating assistance for intercity trans-
portation is warranted in some cases and not others?

Question 2. Has the Administration examined the safety impacts of separating in-
frastructure responsibility from operations over a major corridor? What analysis did 
the  Department  perform?  Did  the  Department  consult  America’s  freight  railroads 
before making such a proposal? What advice did they provide?

Question  3.  Did  the  Administration  study  the  effect  of  not  having  intercity  pas-
senger rail service in congested areas like New Jersey before the President proposed 
the potential bankruptcy of Amtrak?

Question 4. You serve as the Secretary’s representative to the Amtrak board. Has 
the  Board  considered  taking  any  actions  to  cut  routes  to  save  money  immediately? 
If so, how much money could be saved? 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO

HON. KENNETH M. MEAD 

Question  1.  You  testified  before  this  Committee  in  the  last  Congress  that  a  very 
similar  proposal  to  the  Administration’s  would  cost  around  a  billion  and  a  half  dol-
lars a year. Is this still accurate? 

Question 2. Would the President’s proposal likely lead to the reduction of Federal 

spending on intercity passenger rail service?
