Hybrid Technologies for Medium- to

Heavy-Duty Commercial Trucks

TUESDAY, JUNE 10, 2008

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On Tuesday, June 10 the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Com-
mittee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  hold  a  hearing  to  receive  testimony  on  the
state of development of hybrid electric technologies for medium- to heavy-duty com-
mercial vehicle applications and the role of the Department of Energy (DOE) in sup-
porting research and development of these systems. The Committee will also receive
testimony  on  a  discussion  draft  of  legislation  to  be  introduced  by  Rep.  Sensen-
brenner.

Witnesses
Mr. Terry Penney, Technology Manager, Advanced Vehicle and Fuel Technologies,
National Renewable Energy Laboratory
Mr.  Eric  M.  Smith,  Chief  Engineer,  Hybrid  Medium  Duty  Truck,  Eaton  Corpora-
tion
Mr. Joseph Dalum, Vice President, Dueco Inc.
Ms.  Jill  Egbert,  Manager,  Clean  Air  Transportation,  Pacific  Gas  &  Electric  Com-
pany (PG&E)
Mr.  Richard  Parish,  Senior  Program  Manager,  CALSTART  Hybrid  Truck  Users
Forum (HTUF)

The witnesses will discuss the considerable potential for energy savings and emis-
sions  reductions  through  deployment  of  hybrid  electric  systems  in  heavy  duty
trucks,  the  range  of  hybrid  heavy  truck  technologies  and  applications,  the  major
technical  and  market  barriers  in  deploying  these  technologies,  and  their  experience
with the federal energy research programs.

The  witnesses  will  also  offer  their  views  on  the  draft  legislation  to  authorize  a
federal  research  and  demonstration  program  on  hybrid  technologies  for  heavy-duty
vehicles.

Background

There are significant potential economic and environmental benefits from improv-
ing  medium-  to  heavy-duty  vehicles  through  the  electrification  of  drive  trains  and
auxiliary  power  systems.  Hybrid  technologies  (ex:  battery  and  hydraulic)  are  being
developed for a wide range of commercial vehicle platforms such as package delivery
vans, refuse collection trucks, large utility ‘‘bucket trucks,’’ military and construction
vehicles, and even long-haul tractor trailer trucks. Conventional large truck models
share the common characteristics of relatively low fuel efficiency and high emissions
profiles  since  they  must  rely  solely  on  a  diesel  or  gasoline  internal  combustion  en-
gine for power. These inefficiencies are especially evident in trucks that require fre-
quent  starts  and  stops,  or  long  periods  of  non-drive  time  engine  idling  in  order  to
provide  power  for  auxiliary  systems  such  as  bucket  lifters  and  other  work-related
equipment,  off-board  power  tools,  air  conditioning,  and  refrigeration.  By  switching
some driving and auxiliary loads to hybrid systems large trucks stand to save a con-
siderable amount of fuel and greatly reduce their emissions.

For  defense  applications,  hybrid  systems  provide  the  added  benefit  of  generating
very  little  noise,  providing  power  for  radar  and  weapons  systems,  reducing  overall
weight and maintenance requirements, and allowing vehicles to run much longer be-

tween fueling. In fact, military requirements have been a major driver of innovation
in hybrid technologies for heavy vehicles.

The power demands on heavy duty trucks are as varied as the applications. While
several truck companies are testing hybrid models, significant technical hurdles re-
main, and there is no one-size-fits-all hybrid solution for the entire sector. Through
the  course  of  an  average  drive  cycle  the  charging  and  discharging  of  a  hybrid  elec-
tric or hydraulic system on a trash truck, with its frequent starts and stops, dump-
ster lifting, and trash compaction, will be considerably different than that of a util-
ity truck which may idle in one place for several hours in order to operate the buck-
et  lifting  boom  and  other  equipment.  Long  haul  tractor  trailer  rigs  (Class  8)  may
prove even more challenging since they seldom brake during a drive cycle, providing
little  opportunities  for  battery  systems  to  recharge.  The  next  generation  of  trucks
may  also  include  plug-in  hybrid  electric  models  which  can  charge  larger  banks  of
batteries through direct connection to the electricity grid.

While the total number of these vehicles is small compared to passenger vehicles,
their fuel consumption and emissions justify the high costs of development of hybrid
models.  According  to  figures  by  the  Oshkosh  Truck  Corporation  there  are  approxi-
mately 90,000 refuse collection trucks in the U.S. but their collective fuel consump-
tion is roughly equivalent to 2.5 million passenger vehicles (based on 10,000 gallons/
year  per  truck).  Estimates  done  by  the  Eaton  Corporation  show  that  as  little  as
10,000  hybrid  electric  trucks  could  reduce  diesel  fuel  usage  by  7.2  million  gallons/
year (approx. one million barrels of oil), reduce NOΧ emissions by the amount equiv-
alent  to  removing  New  York  City’s  passenger  cars  for  25  days,  and  reduce  carbon
dioxide emissions by 83,000 tons.

The  energy  storage  options  for  hybrid  trucks  generally  include  batteries,  hybrid
hydraulic systems, and ultracapacitors. Batteries receive the most attention and re-
search  funding  because  of  their  applicability  throughout  the  transportation  sector.
To  expand  the  use  of  electricity  in  the  vehicles  sector  batteries  must  be  smaller,
lighter, cheaper, and more powerful. Vehicle batteries typically fall into one of three
families of technologies: lead-acid, nickel metal hydride (NiMH), and lithium-ion (Li-
Ion).  Lead-acid  batteries  have  many  advantages  including  their  relative  simplicity
and  low  cost,  wide-scale  availability,  domestic  manufacturing  capacity,  and  estab-
lished  recycling  infrastructure.  NiMH  batteries  are  found  in  the  current  generation
of  hybrid  vehicles  and  will  be  the  battery  of  choice  for  many  of  the  first  generation
heavy  hybrid  trucks.  However,  high  weight  and  low  power  density  are  significant
issues  for  both  lead-acid  and  NiMH  batteries,  and  they  may  not  be  optimal  for  fu-
ture plug-in hybrid applications. Many in the industry believe the future of hybrids
depends on breakthroughs in new battery technologies, such as the lithium ion (Li-
ion) batteries with their low weight and high power density. But, in addition to solv-
ing  remaining  technical  issues  such  as  heat  management,  the  costs  of  manufac-
turing Li-ion batteries remain prohibitively high for large-scale deployment in vehi-
cles. There is also concern that the U.S. is falling behind in the race to develop and
manufacture  batteries,  and  a  significant  effort  is  underway  to  build  up  a  domestic
supply chain.

The Department of Energy has funded research in this area over the years, most
recently through the 21st Century Truck Partnership which conducts R&D through
public-private efforts with the trucking industry. Other federal agencies involved in
the 21st Century Truck Partnership include the Department of Defense, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Federal research
capabilities exist in DOE laboratories such as the National Renewable Energy Lab-
oratory  and  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  the  EPA’s  National  Vehicle  and  Fuel
Emissions Laboratory, and the Army’s National Automotive Center. Despite the po-
tential  economic  and  environmental  benefits  of  hybrid  trucks  and  the  considerable
technical  hurdles  that  remain,  the  21st  Century  Truck  Partnership  is  facing  de-
creased funding as the Administration chooses to shift the focus of federal research
to the passenger vehicle market.

Draft Legislation

Representative  James  Sensenbrenner  will  have  draft  legislation  available  for  the
Committee  and  witnesses  to  review.  Specifically,  the  draft  legislation  would  accel-
erate  research  of  plug-in  hybrid  technology  in  trucks  by  creating  grants  for  manu-
facturers to build, test, and ultimately sell plug-in hybrid utility and delivery trucks.
The Act would also encourage DOE to expand its research in advanced energy stor-
age technologies to include heavy hybrid trucks as well as passenger vehicles.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  hearing  will  come  to  order.  I  want  to
welcome  the  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  and  our  distinguished
panelists  to  today’s  hearing  on  hybrid  technologies  for  medium-  to
heavy-duty commercial trucks.

With  concerns  about  our  over-reliance  on  foreign  oil,  the  sky-
rocketing costs of fuels, and the effects of our transportation sector
on  air  quality  and  carbon  emissions,  technological  strides  in  the
commercial truck market stand to offer tremendous benefits to our
economic and environmental health.

Though  it  is  easy  to  overlook,  these  vehicles  are  pervasive
throughout  our  economy.  From  school  buses  to  trash  collectors,
utility  trucks  to  delivery  vans,  long-haul  tractor  trailers  to  road
work  equipment,  one  would  be  hard  pressed  to  identify  an  aspect
of  our  daily  lives  that  didn’t  at  some  point  depend  on  medium-to-
heavy trucks, heavy-duty trucks. They also represent a substantial
portion of the U.S. fuel consumption and emissions.

The truck industry is due for a major technological shift. But ad-
vances in this sector don’t come easily, and there is no one-size-fits-
all  solution.  The  demands  on  these  vehicles  are  as  varied  as  their
uses.  Consequently,  there  remains  a  need  for  a  robust  federal  pro-
gram  to  partner  with  industry  and  develop  this  wide  range  of  hy-
brid platforms.

The  focus  for  hybrid  vehicle  technology  development  has  largely
been on passenger vehicles. Passenger vehicles have paved the way
both  in  terms  of  advancing  the  technologies  and  expanding  public
awareness  of  capabilities  of  hybrid  systems.  You  need  only  to  visit
your local dealership and see the waiting lines and lists for hybrid
models to know that the general public is serious about saving fuel
and reducing emissions.

But there is a larger market for hybrids beyond the family auto-
mobile. Reducing fuel costs and meeting environmental regulations
is  vital  to  the  bottom  line  of  any  company  that  relies  on  heavy
trucks. Yet the Administration has chosen to shift resources to the
passenger  automobile  and  away  from  its  21st  Century  Truck  Pro-
gram.  Given  the  significant  gains  to  be  made  in  the  commercial
truck  sector  and  its  indispensable  role  in  our  economy,  we  should
ensure that federal research and development programs continue to
address  the  need  to  improve  fuel  efficiency  of  heavy-duty  vehicles.
We are joined by our colleague, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Ranking Re-
publican  Member  of  the  Investigations  and  Oversight  Sub-
committee,  who  will  soon  introduce  legislation  to  enhance  the  fed-
eral  role  in  the  development  of  heavy  hybrid  vehicles.  I  would  like
to thank him for elevating this subject to the level that it deserves,
and  I  look  forward  to  the  opportunity  to  consider  his  legislation  at
the appropriate time.

And  at  this  time  I  would  yield  to  my  distinguished  colleague
from South Carolina, our Ranking Member, Mr. Inglis, for an open-
ing statement.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

sions.

tion to enhance the federal role in the development of heavy hybrid vehicles. I would
like  to  thank  him  for  elevating  this  subject  to  the  level  it  deserves,  and  I  look  for-
ward to the opportunity to consider his legislation.

At  this  point  I  will  turn  to  the  distinguished  Ranking  Member  of  this  sub-

committee, Mr. Inglis for his opening statement.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  holding

this hearing.

Transportation needs innovation. The transportation sector is our
primary consumer of oil and exhales more carbon dioxide emissions
than  any  other  source.  The  more  we  pay  at  the  pump  each  week,
the easier it is to realize the obvious benefits of alternatives to oil.
It  seems  that  rising  oil  prices  rouse  our  attention  to  ways  that  we
could  ‘‘do  energy’’  a  different  way.  This  hearing  is  a  case  in  point.
In  previous  hearings  of  this  subcommittee  we  have  talked  about
reinventing  the  car.  We  have  heard  the  economic,  environmental,
and  national  security  benefits  that  will  accrue  to  pursuing  hybrid,
battery, and hydrogen technologies to power tomorrow’s cars.

Today we will hear from a number of experts about the medium-
and  heavy-duty  commercial  truck  market  and  its  needs  for  the
same  innovative  focus.  Applications  such  as  hybrid  engines  and
battery-powered  auxiliary  systems  promise  a  significant  reduction
in oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, but technological
hurdles stand in the way of realizing those benefits.

I  join  with  the  Chairman  in  thanking  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  for  in-
troducing  this  draft  legislation  that  would  steer  federal  dollars  to-
ward  research,  development,  and  demonstration  in  the  areas  of
commercial truck hybrid technologies. I would be interested to hear
from  our  witnesses  as  to  whether  current  oil  prices  are  enough  in-
centive  for  heavy  truck  companies  to  invest  in  these  technologies,

or if there is a necessary role for the Federal Government to assist
in overcoming these technological hurdles.

Thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from
our witnesses on their perspectives in this, on their perspectives in
this legislation and suggestions as to ways we might improve it.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  but  technological  hurdles  stand  in  the
way of realizing those benefits.

ment.

I’d  also  like  to  thank  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  for  introducing  draft  legislation  that
would steer federal dollars toward research, development, and demonstration in the
area of commercial truck hybrid technologies. I’d be interested to hear from our wit-
nesses as to whether current oil prices are enough incentive for heavy truck compa-
nies to invest in these technologies, or if there’s still a necessary role for the Federal
Government to assist in overcoming these technological hurdles.

Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on
their perspectives of this legislation and any suggestions they may have to improve
it.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Inglis.
And now I would like to recognize Mr. Sensenbrenner for a state-

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
New  taxes  are  not  the  only  solution  to  climate  change.  We  need
to  focus  our  economy  as  we  work  to  reduce  our  emissions.  We  can
over  regulate  our  businesses,  cripple  our  economic  development,
and watch as China and India race past us, sputtering greenhouse
gases  along  the  way.  Or  Congress  can  create  incentives  that  en-
courage  the  development  of  new  technologies  that  will  reduce  our
emissions,  foster  economic  development,  and  allow  U.S.  manufac-
turers to export their energy-saving technologies worldwide.

A  honking  motorcade  of  trucks  around  the  Capitol  last  month
flashed signs that read, ‘‘When Trucks Stop, America Stops.’’ Com-
mercial traffic is truly vital to the American economy, and the fuel
costs  for  trucks  directly  affects  costs  for  all  Americans.  The  addi-
tional  price  of  their  fuel  raises  the  price  of  our  food,  health  care,
manufacturing, retail, waste removal, and other goods and services.
And  while  our  economy  would  not  survive  without  them,  trucks
consume  huge  quantities  of  oil,  which  raises  the  cost  of  their  busi-
nesses  and  raises  our  dependence  on  oil  and  injects  greenhouse
gases into the environment.

The answer is not to burden these businesses already strained by
high  fuel  costs  with  additional  taxes  for  the  CO2 they  release.  In-
stead,  we  need  to  encourage  the  development  and  introduction  of
technologies that will reduce their fuel consumption.

The  technologies  we  need  already  exist.  Everybody  has  seen  hy-
brid cars. This technology, which combines gas and electric motors
for a powerful and efficient engine, is even more practical in trucks.
Even  though  there  are  fewer  trucks  on  the  road,  trucks  use  more
fuel.

Utility trucks, for example, typically drive short distances to and
from a work site, but sit idle for hours while on site. A plug-in hy-
brid  truck  would  use  less  fuel  getting  to  and  from  the  site  and
would  operate  without  any  fuel  on  the  site.  Ultimately,  a  plug-in
hybrid engine in a utility truck could use up to 60 percent less fuel.
Delivery  trucks  constantly  stop  and  go.  Hybrid  engines  excel  at
this type of driving because the engine can essentially turn off dur-
ing short accelerations, while coasting and while it is at a stop.

Developing these technologies will have benefits beyond fuel sav-
ings. By making our trucks more efficient, we will make our goods
and services more affordable and then become leaders in these new
technologies.  Like  America,  Asia  is  faced  with  rising  fuel  costs.
Their trucking fleets, like ours, are currently powered by diesel. In
Europe the price of diesel has risen to nearly $9 a gallon. This has
led to a strike. Spanish truckers are currently holding a ‘‘snail pro-
test,’’  essentially  blockading  the  highways  of  Spain  and  Southern
France by inching along the road. Anti-protest demonstrators, fear-
ing  that  food  and  other  goods  could  become  scarce,  have  rebelled
violently by slashing truck tires and smashing their windshields. If
America’s  companies  are  the  first  to  develop  and  commercialize
products  such  as  the  topic  of  the  hearing  today,  not  only  can  we
avoid  a  similar  fate,  but  we  can  export  these  technologies  world-
wide.

By  helping  American  manufacturers  research  and  commercialize
new  technologies,  we  can  strengthen  our  economy,  reduce  our  de-
pendence  on  foreign  oil,  and  lower  our  emissions.  The  legislation
we  will  discuss  today  is  a  narrow  example  of  how  technology,  and
not  taxes  or  carbon  offset  credits,  can  help  solve  our  energy  crisis.
The  legislation  would  accelerate  research  of  plug-in  hybrid  tech-
nology in trucks by creating grants for manufacturers to build, test,
and  sell  plug-in  hybrid  utility  and  delivery  trucks.  The  Act  would
also encourage the Department of Energy to expand its research in
advanced  energy  storage  technologies  to  include  heavy  hybrid
trucks  as  well  as  passenger  vehicles.  This  bill  will  put  plug-in  hy-
brid  trucks  on  the  road  and  help  advance  research  and  accelerate
commercialization of this important technology.

I thank the Chairman for holding this hearing and the witnesses
for lending their expertise to this effort, and yield back the balance
of my time.

cans. The additional price of their fuel raises the price of our food, health care, man-
ufacturing, retail, waste removal, and other the goods and services. While our econ-

raises the cost of their business, increases our dependence on oil, and injects green-

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  the  Subcommittee  giving  attention  to  this  matter,  it

is particularly salient topic as gas and diesel prices continue to rise every day.

Hybrid technology for passenger cars has received an increasing amount of media
and  consumer  attention  recently  as  gas  prices  continue  to  soar.  As  alternative  fuel
technologies  advance  for  passenger  vehicles,  I  am  pleased  that  this  committee  has
turned its attention to the status of renewable technologies for medium- and heavy-
duty trucks.

There are many benefits to hybrid technologies for heavy-duty trucks, and variety
of electric vehicles systems currently exist to serve in various capacities. The cross-
country  shipping  industry,  the  military,  utility  companies  and  the  construction  in-
dustry can all benefit from the expansion of hybrid technologies. A manufacturer in
my district in Southern Illinois, BNSF Railway and Vehicle Projects LLC, are devel-
oping a switch locomotive powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. This technology can help

these industries to not only to lower their carbon footprints, but to also reduce their
expenses  by  decreasing  the  amount  of  gasoline  for  their  fleets  of  medium-  and
heavy-duty trucks.

At this critical time when Congress will embark upon major climate change legis-
lation  in  the  near  future,  we  must  ensure  that  funding  is  dedicated  to  overcoming
the  existing  challenges  that  face  this  developing  technology.  Although  the  Depart-
ment of Energy once funded a program to develop and test early heavy hybrid tech-
nologies that yielded encouraging results, the Bush Administration has since termi-
nated the funding.

As  we  will  hear  today,  many  utility  companies  currently  use  hybrid  trucks  in
their  fleet  today.  If  additional  funding  is  invested,  the  foundation  of  technology  ex-
ists to launch hybrid technologies into the mass-consumer level. With the proper re-
sources, the United States can take advantage of the opportunity to become a leader
in hybrid technology.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  my  time;  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  wit-

nesses today. I yield back.

STATEMENT OF MR. TERRY PENNEY, TECHNOLOGY MANAGER,
ADVANCED  VEHICLE  TECHNOLOGIES,  NATIONAL  RENEW-
ABLE ENERGY LABORATORY, GOLDEN, COLORADO
Mr.  PENNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  other  Members  for
this opportunity to talk about the status and potential of heavy hy-
brid trucks.

NREL  has  been  working  for  the  last  15  years  with  partners  in
government,  other  national  labs,  and  industry  on  both  light  and
heavy-duty hybrids. Despite the tremendous progress that has been
made, I believe that targeted R&D and purchase incentives are still
needed  so  these  trucks  can  grow  in  volume  and  play  a  prominent
role in the marketplace.

Primarily, because of escalating fuel prices and tougher emission
standards, the cost in operating and producing heavy-duty vehicles
are rising at alarming rates. But there are reasons to be optimistic.
Despite  the  fact  that  more  fuel  is  being  used  by  our  light-duty  car
fleet, and we are working hard on those vehicles too, we should not
ignore advanced heavy truck technologies across many applications
that  can  also  significantly  reduce  their  fuel  use  and  subsequent
emissions.

To frame the opportunity, first a little background. About 80 per-
cent  of  all  our  goods  are  transported  by  truck,  and  last  year  Class
one  through  Class  eight  trucks  consumed  about  40  billion  gallons
of  diesel  fuel.  The  good  news,  hybrid  trucks  in  various  forms  from

11

research  prototypes  to  recent  early  commercialization  products
have  demonstrated  the  potential  to  reduce  fuel  costs  anywhere
from a few percent to 50 to 60 percent.

Original equipment manufacturers, OEMs, and truck owners are
learning that their exact savings depend on three things: the appli-
cation,  the  duty  cycle,  and  the  way  it  is  driven,  and  of  course,  the
distance it travels between stop and go.

For example, a typical delivery truck using a hybrid drive system
could  save  more  than  a  thousand  gallons  of  fuel  per  year  in  com-
parison to a conventional truck. We believe almost every truck ap-
plication  can  benefit  from  hybrid  drive  of  some  sort  and  other  sys-
tem improvements.

In addition to NREL’s fleet testing, we have shown that hybrids’
overall operating and maintenance costs per mile can be lower, too,
in  part  because  of  fewer  brake  replacements  and  less  downtime,
which help lower the cost differential between conventional and hy-
brid drive trains.

Let  us  quickly  review  the  potential  for  hybrids  and  or  perhaps
plug-in hybrid truck applications by class, and if you have my testi-
mony  in  front  of  you,  take  a  look  at  page  two  and  page  three,
where  I  describe  the  classes  one  through  eight,  and  you  will  see
that  classes  one  through  four  are  your  typical  minivans,  utility
vans,  pickup  trucks,  five  includes  a  shuttle  or  city  delivery  and  a
bucket  truck.  Class  six  is  a  beverage  or  a  school  bus.  Class  seven
is refuse haulers, furniture delivery, city transit buses, for example,
and  of  course,  Class  eight  is  dump  trucks,  cement  trucks,  and  line
haul semis.

Of  course,  military  vehicles  of  all  classes  and  sizes  could  also
benefit  from  hybridization,  and  several  have  already  been  dem-
onstrated as you are well aware.

I  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  to  the  Class  eight  trucks.
They  use,  and  this  is  on  page  three,  you  will  notice  that  they  use
as  much  diesel  fuel  as  all  other  truck  classes  combined,  and  until
recently  many  believed  there  was  little  hope  in  hybridizing  line
haul  semis  because  they  don’t  have  much  stop  and  go,  which  is
classic of the hybrid cycle. However, even in this class, truck OEMs
are finding opportunities for fuel savings, even if only in the single
digits,  because  hybridization  and  other  system  improvements  can
yield tremendous savings.

Today  hybrid  trucks  are  just  starting  to  hit  the  market  in  var-
ious  service  applications,  most  notably  transit  buses,  though  for
most applications it is tough, it is a tough sell. This is probably be-
cause the cost premiums which result from limited current produc-
tion quantities and the need for further improvement and establish
the system reliability, economics, and performance of various truck
components.

Along  with  continuing  credits  and  incentives,  we  need  to  con-
tinue  our  R&D  programs  to  improve  the  performance  and  econom-
ics  of  these  hybrid  systems.  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  re-
cently completed a detailed examination of the 21st Century Truck
Partnership Projects in this area, and that report is expected to be
delivered  to  the  Department  of  Energy  in  the  next  few  weeks.  I
would encourage you to review its findings.

There  are  approximately  18  million  commercial  vehicles  on  the
road,  every  kind  of  vehicle  represents  a  different  set  of  demands,
and  these,  in  turn,  determine  vehicle  size,  configuration,  and  each
with  a  different  duty  cycle.  As  a  result,  there  are  many  unique
powertrain solutions. A hybrid is not just a hybrid. Today there are
a  handful  of  demonstration  hybrid  trucks,  many  supported  by  fed-
eral and State cost-sharing programs and are shedding life on both
opportunities and challenges, but production volumes are still very
low and not very high since system costs from drive trains through
energy  storage  systems  to  power  electronics  must  be  continued  to
be reduced.

So  with  these  considerations  in  mind,  what  needs  to  be  done?
First,  we  must  understand  the  unique  duty  cycle  of  the  hybrid  ve-
hicle.  Then  we  need  to  understand  how  these  new  powertrain
topologies  can  boost  miles  per  gallon  or  ton  miles  delivered.  We
must  take  an  overall  systems  approach  to  greater  efficiency.  We
also  need  to  work  on  advanced  combustion,  heat  recovery,  energy
storage  technology,  especially  batteries  and  ultracapacitors,  to  im-
prove  the  cost,  performance,  and  life  and  thermal  abuse  tolerance.
Finally, we need to improve the overall performance and costs asso-
ciated  with  the  power  of  electronics  module  and  electric  drive
motor,  improving  performance,  life,  and  reliability  issues  through
advanced thermal control.

Despite a limited DOE budget, the DOE Vehicle Technology Pro-
gram  is  actively  engaged  in  pursuing  many  of  these  technical
areas. With DOE’s support of NREL, we employ heavy hybrid vehi-
cle  R&D  testing,  analysis  to  understand  and  solve  many  technical
issues  and  overcome  these  barriers  while  working  with  OEMs  and
their suppliers.

For example, NREL’s ReFUEL lab tests advanced fuels and dou-
ble,  and  heavy-duty  engines  for  advanced  heavy  hybrid  vehicles
and  is  home,  unique  testing,  and  measurement  equipment.  With
industry  partners  we  also  conduct  field  evaluations  of  transit
buses,  trucks,  idle-reduction  technologies.  We  design  test  plans,
gather on-site data, and publish our results. Education, getting the
word out, helping industry and fleet owners learn about what actu-
ally works and what doesn’t, has been a hallmark of our efforts.

The  government’s  commitment  to  funding,  finding  solutions  for
supporting  advanced  R&D  and  government  industry  partnerships
and by encouraging incentives is absolute key.

Thank you so much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TERRY PENNEY

Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  providing  this  opportunity  to  talk  about
the  status  and  potential  of  heavy-duty  hybrid  trucks  in  the  United  States,  and  the
research  and  development  and  policy  support  that  is  needed  to  give  them  a  more
prominent  role  in  the  marketplace.  As  groups  like  the  Hybrid  Truck  Users  Forum
have recently noted, hybrid trucks are right ‘‘on the cusp’’ of production in medium-
and heavy-duty commercial markets, and there is much we can do to tip the balance
in  their  favor,  and  in  ours,  in  terms  of  achieving  greater  energy  security  and  less-
ening our reliance on imported fuels.

I  am  the  Technology  Manager  for  Advanced  Vehicle  Technologies  in  the  Renew-
able  Fuels  Science  and  Technology  directorate  at  the  National  Renewable  Energy
Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. NREL is the U.S. Department of Energy’s primary
laboratory for R&D in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and we

13

are  dedicated  to  helping  the  Nation  develop  a  full  portfolio  of  technologies  that  can
meet our energy needs.

It  is  an  honor  to  be  here  and  to  speak  with  you  today.  I  want  to  commend  the
Committee  for  its  interest  in  exploring  ways  to  reduce  the  use  of  imported  petro-
leum  in  the  commercial  sector,  curb  emissions  associated  with  burning  fossil  fuels
for  transportation,  and  increase  the  competitiveness  of  U.S.  manufacturers  and
truck fleets through greater use of hybrid trucks.

Despite the progress we have achieved in fuel efficiency and emissions reductions
over recent years, the costs associated with producing and operating our heavy-duty
fleets  have  risen  at  alarming  rates.  There  exists  today  great  potential  from  several
heavy-duty  hybrid  truck  technologies  to  significantly  reduce  fuel  consumption  and
emissions. This should in turn improve the economic picture for U.S. truck manufac-
turers, suppliers, fleets, and customers alike.

First,  a  little  background.  Approximately  80  percent  of  all  the  goods  transported
in the United States today are moved by truck. In all, the United States consumed
about  140  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  and  about  40  billion  gallons  of  diesel  fuel  for
on-road  transportation  in  2004,  according  to  the  Department  of  Energy.  The  U.S.
now imports more than 60 percent of the crude oil it uses. Retail gasoline and diesel
fuel prices have reached record highs in recent months, and the retail price of diesel
is well over $4 per gallon in most parts of the Nation.

Given the current situation, we see considerable potential for hybrid trucks to re-
duce fuel use, and thus costs, from five percent at minimum, to as much as 50 per-
cent to 60 percent at the high end. Although exact reductions depend on the actual
use  of  the  truck—and  specifically,  the  way  it’s  driven  and  the  distance  traveled  be-
tween  stops—there  is  virtually  no  truck  application  that  cannot  benefit  from  a  hy-
brid  drive  train  and  related  system  improvements.  Potential  applications  include
shuttle  and  school  buses,  military  vehicles,  utility  trucks,  bucket  trucks,  beverage
delivery and parcel delivery trucks, refuse haulers, and some large Class 8 vehicles.
Because trucks generally use much more fuel per year than passenger vehicles, the
overall savings potential is very significant (see illustrations that follow).

Plug-in  hybrid  trucks  are  on  the  horizon,  as  well.  Plug-in  hybrid  systems  could
benefit not only industry and the environment, they perhaps could alter the nature
of our utility grids, by providing stored energy and a form of mobile distributed en-
ergy  generation.  Before  we  can  begin  to  realize  these  benefits  widely,  however,  we
must  address  some  remaining  issues  surrounding  hybrid  and  plug-in  hybrid  tech-
nologies.

Heavy-Duty Hybrid Trucks: Some Major Issues

An  article  in  the  April  27,  2008,  edition  of  the  New  York  Times  noted  that  com-
mercial vehicles, particularly those making frequent stops, should be the ‘‘killer’’ ap-
plication  for  hybrid  technologies,  because  hybrids  often  work  best  in  the  kind  of
stop-and-go  conditions  that  delivery  trucks  and  refuse  haulers  experience.  Despite
this  potential,  there  remain  relatively  few  hybrid  trucks  on  the  road.  The  primary
reasons for this are the costs of the hybrid systems, the limited commercial produc-
tion to date, and the need to further improve the economics and performance of en-
ergy storage, power electronics, auxiliary loads and engine idling systems.

Light-duty hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), such as the Toyota Prius and Ford Es-
cape  Hybrid,  have  gained  public  attention  and  some  market  momentum  in  recent
years. The added price of hybrid systems have been somewhat offset by tax policies
at  the  federal  and  the  State  levels.  It  should  be  noted  that  light  duty  and  heavy
duty  applications  can  be  much  different  in  overall  design  and  individual  compo-
nents. The price premium for hybrid systems will be proportionally greater for large
commercial vehicles, because of their size and complexities. These higher costs have
slowed  widespread  acceptance  of  these  technologies,  potential  fuel  savings  notwith-
standing.

Hybrid  technologies  improve  fuel  economy,  primarily  by  turning  off  the  engine
when idling, such as when coasting or at a stop. They use batteries and electric mo-
tors for short accelerations, recharge the batteries by recovering the energy used in
braking, and use batteries for auxiliary loads such as cabin cooling. The combustion
engines in HEVs can thus be smaller than those in conventional heavy vehicles. Our
fleet  testing  has  shown  how  overall  maintenance  and  operating  costs  per  mile  can
also be lower for hybrids, in part because of a decrease in brake replacement costs.
The  energy  storage  system  is  the  most  critical  component  for  hybridization  and
electric vehicles generally. The energy storage system must be affordable, safe, and
durable enough to last through the major portion of the vehicle’s life. Since vehicles
operate  at  many  different  climates  and  temperatures,  energy  storage  systems  must
be  able  to  perform  well  at  low  temperatures  and  not  quickly  degrade  at  high  tem-
peratures. Current commercial light duty and heavy duty vehicles use Nickel Metal
Hydride  (NiMH)  batteries,  mostly  from  Japanese  manufacturers.  Research  and  de-
velopment  on  advanced  energy  storage  systems,  such  as  lithium  ion  batteries  and
ultracapacitors,  is  expanding,  with  hybrid  electric  vehicle  systems  being  seen  as  a
primary use.

One  major  concern  is  the  domestic  production  of  batteries.  Relying  on  a  few  for-
eign sources of battery production (Japan, Korea, China, and France) could increase
costs  and  create  new  energy  security  concerns.  Domestic  production  of  energy  stor-
age  materials  and  U.S.-based  manufacturing  of  energy  storage  systems  should  be
encouraged.

To  increase  market  acceptance,  energy  storage  systems  must  be  improved  to  re-
duce their weight and size. Enhanced power and storage capacity are two other key
goals of current R&D.

Improving a hybrid’s power electronics system likewise is essential. In some vehi-
cle  systems,  the  power  electronics  module  costs  as  much  as  the  energy  storage  sys-
tem. Boosting the performance and cutting the cost of this system will lead to more
favorable economics for hybrid trucks.

Other  issues  include  improving  the  efficiency  and  cost-effectiveness  of  idling  re-
duction  technologies.  For  long-haul  trucks  especially,  there  exists  considerable  op-
portunity  to  decrease  the  effects  of  aerodynamic  drag  on  the  vehicle,  primarily

through use of lightweight yet strong materials for the truck body, and development
of  heavy-duty  tires  with  low  rolling  resistance.  Government  and  industry  groups
working  together  through  the  21st  Century  Truck  Partnership  (21  CT)  have  found
that  aerodynamic  drag  resistance,  rolling  resistance,  drive-train  losses,  and  auxil-
iary  load  losses  represent  fully  40  percent  of  the  total  fuel  energy  used  to  move  a
heavy-duty vehicle.

Potential for Fuel Savings and Emission Reductions

Commercial vehicles running on diesel fuel can easily tally 75,000 miles in a year
and, at $4-plus per gallon, pay $1,000 for just one fill-up. Thus, a relatively modest
increase  in  fuel  efficiency—even  five  percent—can  have  a  major  financial  impact
over  time.  Urban  hybrid  trucks  that  make  frequent  stops  and  starts  could  see  and
up  to  60  percent  savings  in  fuels  costs,  depending  on  the  way  the  truck  is  driven
and which hybrid system is used. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) esti-
mates  that  a  typical  delivery  truck  using  a  hybrid  drive  train  system  could  save
more than 1,000 gallons of fuel per year in comparison to the fuel used by a similar
conventional truck.

Energy  recovery  is  a  major  benefit  of  hybridization.  By  converting  the  vehicle’s
dynamic energy into electrical energy during braking, less fuel is spent overall. The
benefits  of  energy  recovery  will  be  greatest  for  urban  vehicles  with  repeated  start-
and-stop  cycles.  The  hybrid’s  control  system  effectively  allows  for  separation  of  the
engine speed from the speed of auxiliary or ancillary devices, which offers many ad-
vantages.

Electrification of a truck’s auxiliary systems, like heating, air conditioning and en-
tertainment systems, allows the engine to be shut down instead of idling. Again, po-
tential fuel savings is significant, as U.S. trucks idle an average of 1,830 hours per
year.

In  addition,  modern  long  haul  trucks  are  increasingly  equipped  with  automated
gearboxes  to  control  the  engine  speed  and  save  fuel.  This  has  opened  up  the  possi-
bility  of  introducing  ‘‘Eco-roll.’’  When  no  engine  power  is  needed,  the  gearbox  goes
into  neutral  and  the  engine  runs  on  idle,  saving  one  percent  to  two  percent  of  fuel.
With electrification, we can shut the engine off during coasting for an additional one
percent savings. Blending the use of gasoline engine and electric systems allows for
added fuel savings.

Another  feature  is  the  ability  for  low-speed  moving  of  the  vehicle  in  electric-only
mode. This is useful when going in and out of docks, in harbors, in traffic jams, and
so  on.  Considering  projected  increases  for  traffic  congestion,  this  feature  could  be
even more valuable in the future.

Future trucks need to be much more efficient than they are today. Electrification
of a truck enables waste heat recovery systems, in which heat can be converted back
to  energy.  Waste  heat  recovery  systems  are  estimated  to  reduce  fuel  consumption
about  six  percent  to  eight  percent.  Also,  using  an  electric  motor  for  torque  assist
can  help  downspeed  the  engine,  or  downsize  it,  with  both  alternatives  saving  fuel.
Fuel  savings  provide  emission  reductions  as  well.  A  recent  study  by  the
CALSTART  partnership  evaluated  the  increases  in  fuel  economy  and  reductions  in
emissions obtained for a hybrid truck during four driving cycles, compared to a con-
ventional  vehicle.  The  study  found  that  in  one  driving  cycle  of  70  miles,  lasting  1.5
hours, the hybrid truck showed a 68 percent increase in fuel economy and a 58 per-
cent  reduction  in  hydrocarbons,  on  a  gallons-per-mile  basis.  A  50  percent  decrease
in  carbon  monoxide,  a  34  percent  reduction  in  oxides  of  nitrogen  and  a  25  percent
decrease  in  particulate  matter  were  also  reported.  This  is  significant,  because  to
meet current and upcoming EPA regulations, conventional trucks can lose as much
as five to ten percent in fuel economy. This is a result of the use of fuel by advanced
emission  control  systems  and  also  from  aggressive  exhaust  gas  recovery  strategies
for lower oxide of nitrogen emissions. Hybrid trucks offer the potential to reduce the
overall  emission  reduction  requirements  and  therefore  reduce  the  accompanying
emission control fuel economy penalty.

Applications for Hybrid Technologies

Hybrid  electric  powertrains  can  be  used  in  many,  if  not  most,  of  the  Nation’s  ap-
proximately  18  million  commercial  vehicles.  Stop-and-go  short-haul  commercial  ve-
hicles  are  well-suited  for  systems  that  capture  braking  energy,  assist  the  engine
during  frequent  accelerations,  and  turn  off  the  engine  during  coasting  and  stops.
However,  each  kind  of  commercial  vehicle  presents  a  different  set  of  demands,
which in turn determine the vehicle size, configuration, and duty cycles. As a result,
each type is likely to have a different hybrid power-train solution. For example, the
duty cycle of a refuse hauler usually consists of a long drive to a neighborhood, fol-

ultracapacitors—devices  with  enough  power  to  move  heavy  loads  over  short  dis-
tances—while the engine is used to and from the waste site.

this  application  might  be 

than  using  batteries, 

Hybrid transit buses are in use today and have demonstrated an average 27 per-
cent  reduction  in  fuel  use.  Depending  on  the  climate,  about  25  percent  of  the  fuel
used for transit buses is for heating and cooling passengers. School buses can double
the  fuel  economy  with  hybridization,  but  today  cost  twice  the  $70,000  price  tag  of
a  conventional  bus.  Postal  delivery  vehicles  could  benefit  significantly  from  plug-in
operation if they could use the engine to reach a neighborhood, then go to all-electric
mode while making mailbox-to-mailbox stops.

Many  commercial  vehicles  idle  for  extended  periods  during  package  deliveries,
refuse  collection,  or  to  operate  necessary  equipment  like  fans,  extension  buckets,
backhoes,  and  related  equipment.  Altogether,  idling  of  commercial  vehicles  is  esti-
mated  to  consume  more  than  two  billion  gallons  of  fuel  annually,  while  producing
unwanted emissions.

Long-haul  trucks,  which  operate  at  fairly  constant  speeds,  have  challenges  all
their  own.  Long-haul  trucks  consume  nearly  16  billion  gallons  of  diesel  fuel  annu-
ally,  with  opportunities  for  increasing  fuel  economy  in  this  truck  class  centering
around  development  of  more  efficient  engines,  reduction  of  aerodynamic  drag,  and
use  of  low-rolling-resistance  tires.  Biofuels  may  offer  advantages  as  well.  Another
promising  method  of  cutting  fuel  consumption  and  emissions  is  to  use  batteries,  or
plug  in  directly  to  electricity  sources,  at  truck  stops.  Off-board  service  to  the  truck
can  provide  heating  and  cooling,  and  electricity  for  lighting,  entertainment  and  an-
cillary equipment during mandatory driver rest periods. Such needs today are large-
ly met through idling of the truck’s main engine.

In addition, long-haul trucks are being studied in order to determine the benefits
of some form of hybridization as well, especially when their routes involve climbing
and  descending  hills.  Such  applications  could  ultimately  deliver  huge  fuel  savings,
despite their relatively small gains in efficiency.

Today’s Market Issues

Promising developments are on the horizon for hybrid trucks, as early prototypes

and demonstration vehicles shed new light on both opportunities and challenges.

For  example,  one  delivery  service  is  creating  a  fleet  of  100  hybrid  vans  that  will
offer  an  estimated  57  percent  improvement  in  fuel  economy  and  significantly  lower
emissions. Other planned new delivery vans can travel up to 20 miles on electricity
alone.  At  a  recent  Hybrid  Truck  Users  Forum  meeting,  at  least  15  truck  manufac-
turers  announced  plans  to  build  or  demonstrate  new  vehicles.  They  will  be  used  in
refuse  hauling,  delivery,  shuttle  bus,  school  bus,  bucket  truck,  heavy  truck  applica-
tions and more.

Industry and deployment groups are finding that the applications are quickly ex-
panding for trucks built on a core hybrid chassis and then customized for particular
uses.  However,  because  the  overall  production  volume  of  these  trucks  is  still  not
high,  they  are  available  only  at  premium  prices.  This  means  that  system  costs,  for
drive-trains  through  energy  storage  systems  to  power  electronics,  must  continue  to
be  reduced.  Consequently,  support  for  continued  R&D  and  for  policy  incentives  re-
mains vital.

Current Federal Programs and Policies

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Vehicle  Technologies  Program  supports  the  develop-
ment  of  advanced  combustion  and  engines  design,  durable  and  affordable  advanced
batteries covering the full range of vehicle applications, from start/stop to full-power
hybrid electric, electric, and fuel cell vehicles. NREL’s extensive testing and analysis
capabilities  are  being  used  to  understand  and  solve  energy  storage  thermal  issues
in both light- and heavy-duty hybrid applications.

The  Department  of  Energy  is  also  the  lead  federal  agency  in  the  21st  Century
Truck Partnership, established to develop the heavy-duty vehicles of the future. The
partnership also includes the Departments of Defense and Transportation, the EPA,
as well as numerous industry members. Groups such as CALSTART and the Hybrid
Truck  Users  Forum  are  also  doing  much  to  support  and  promote  the  greater  use
and availability of hybrid commercial trucks.

Recently  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  conducted  a  thorough  review  of  the
21st Century Truck Partnership program. Their final report will be delivered to the
Partnership in a few weeks. Their conclusions and recommendation should be valu-
able to the Committee as it evaluates the opportunities in heavy hybrids.

Along with automotive companies and their suppliers, NREL has been developing
and  evaluating  new  technologies  that  reduce  climate  control  loads  as  well  as  ana-
lyzing  and  evaluating  the  thermal  performance  of  advanced  lithium-ion  batteries
and  ultracapacitors  for  energy  storage.  NREL  is  conducting  research  to  develop
thermal  control  technologies  that  enable  high  power  density  solutions  for  reducing
the overall cost of the power electronics system. Our research includes experimental
and  numerical  modeling  focused  on  developing  advanced  thermal  interface  mate-
rials,  single-phase  liquid,  and  two-phase  jet  and  spray  cooling  technology,  surface
enhancements  for  advanced  heat  exchangers,  air  cooling,  and  thermal  system  inte-
gration.

NREL’s  Renewable  Fuels  and  Lubricants  (ReFUEL)  Research  Laboratory,  a  test
facility  for  advanced  fuels  in  heavy-duty  engines  and  advanced  heavy  hybrid  vehi-
cles,  houses  unique  testing  and  measurement  equipment.  These  include  a  heavy-
duty  vehicle  chassis  dynamometer  for  testing  hybrid  trucks  and  buses,  with  a  road
load simulation capability from 8,000 pounds to 80,000 pounds; a heavy-duty engine
transient  test  cell  (up  to  400  hp)  for  fuels  research  and  development;  and  an  emis-
sions  measurement  capability  sensitive  enough  to  be  compliant  with  federal  certifi-
cation procedures required in 2007. NREL has performed both electric and hydraulic
hybrid vehicle test projects with manufacturers including Eaton/International, Osh-
kosh, and Allison GM, for hybrid buses, refuse haulers, and step vans.

In  addition,  DOE’s  Advanced  Vehicle  Testing  activities  benchmark  and  validate
the  performance  of  light-,  medium-,  and  heavy-duty  vehicles  that  feature  one  or
more  advanced  technologies,  including  internal  combustion  engines  burning  ad-
vanced  fuels,  such  as  100  percent  hydrogen  and  hydrogen/compressed  natural  gas-
blended  fuels;  hybrid  electric,  pure  electric,  and  hydraulic  drive  systems;  advanced
batteries and engines; and advanced climate control, power electronic, and other an-
cillary  systems.  The  NREL  team  has  conducted  medium-  and  heavy-duty  vehicle
evaluations,  including  evaluations  of  transit  buses,  trucks,  and  idle  reduction  tech-
nologies. Tasks include identifying fleets to evaluate, designing test plans, gathering
on-site data, preparing technical reports, and communicating the results. This work
is funded by the Department’s Vehicle Technologies Program.

Numerous  other  partnership  opportunities  and  incentives  help  manufacturers  to
develop  and  fleets  to  purchase  hybrid  trucks  in  the  United  States,  at  both  the  fed-
eral  and  the  State  level.  The  Environmental  Defense  Fund  has  compiled  an  online
resource of tax credits and other incentives: www.edf.org/page.cfm?tagID+1124

Summary

This  testimony  shows  that  there  is  no  single  hybrid  truck  design  or  system  that
will  meet  all  our  commercial  transportation  needs.  Different  solutions  are  needed
both  to  improve  the  fuel  economy  of  heavy-duty  vehicles  and  to  reduce  associated
emissions. Specific technologies and systems for achieving those objectives in heavy-
duty  hybrid  vehicles  will  differ,  depending  on  the  vehicle’s  application  and  duty
cycle.

As we move toward a future in which advanced vehicle technologies play a larger
role, we understand the corresponding need to create a U.S. manufacturing base for
heavy-duty  hybrids,  and  their  components.  Otherwise,  we  might  be  trading  our  de-
pendence  on  imported  petroleum  for  a  dependence  on  imported  batteries  and  other
components, a potentially serious issue for U.S. competitiveness.

Thus, a portfolio of energy-saving and environmental solutions will serve to meet
our nation’s economic, energy, and transportation challenges as well as enhance our
energy  security.  A  strong  federal  R&D  and  policy  role  is  essential  to  development
of these solutions.

Thank you.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ERIC  M.  SMITH,  CHIEF  ENGINEER,  ME-
DIUM  DUTY  HYBRID  ELECTRIC  POWERTRAINS,  EATON  COR-
PORATION
Mr.  SMITH.  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  thank
you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  today.  My  name  is  Eric  Smith,
and  I  am  the  Chief  Engineer  for  Medium-Duty  Hybrid  Electric
Powertrains  for  the  Eaton  Corporation.  Eaton  is  headquartered  in
Cleveland, Ohio. We have over 79,000 employees worldwide, includ-
ing over 28,000 employees in more than 40 states.

A little bit of background on the Eaton hybrid power system. Fol-
lowing  years  of  successful  development  and  extensive  real-world
testing, Eaton is currently offering production hybrid electric prod-
ucts  for  commercial  vehicle  applications,  and  our  first  hybrid  hy-
draulic  products  will  enter  the  market  later  this  year.  Eaton’s  hy-
brid  electric  power  system  is  currently  in  production  option  in
North  America  with  Peterbilt,  Kenworth,  International,  and
Freightliner, and we are also working with leading European man-
ufacturers such as DAF Trucks and Daimler Trucks.

Eaton  was  part  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  Clean  En-
ergy  Trade  Mission  to  China,  and  we  are  working  currently  to
place  over  200  hybrid  electric  buses  in  Guangzhou,  China.  Those
should all be placed by the end of 2008.

The  design  and  development  effort  for  all  of  this  work  is  hap-
pening  at  Eaton  facilities  in  Michigan  and  Minnesota,  and  our  hy-
brid systems are produced currently in Indiana and Iowa.

Eaton  has  invested  in  three  separate  hybrid  power  solutions  for
commercial  vehicles.  First,  our  hybrid  electric  vehicle.  Eaton’s  pro-
duction  hybrid  electric  power  system  can  provide  significant  fuel
savings and reduce vehicle emissions. Hybrid power is particularly
appealing  in  Classes  five  through  eight  vehicles.  These  are  large
trucks  with  weights  exceeding  16,000  pounds,  such  as  pick-up  and
delivery and utility trucks.

And as you can see on my graph that is displayed here, the fuel
savings  possible  on  the  range  of  trucks  we  are  discussing  is  not
only  from  improved  fuel  economy  while  driving  but  also  from  re-
duction in engine idle or engine off operation at work sites.

Additionally, Eaton’s hybrid electric power system is the only cer-
tified by the IRS for the medium- and heavy-duty hybrid tax credit
that was enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

I  would  like  to  speak  just  briefly  on  the  hybrid  hydraulic  vehi-
cles.  In  addition  to  hybrid  electrics  that  I  have  mentioned,  Eaton
is also working on development of hybrid hydraulic vehicles for ap-
plications  such  as  refuse  trucks  and  pick-up  and  delivery  vehicles.
We  are  working  with  the  EPA  and  the  Army  to  research  and  de-
velop these vehicles.

Finally,  a  few  comments  on  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles.  In  addition
to the hybrid electric and hybrid hydraulic vehicles, plug-in hybrid
technology  in  the  early  stages  of  development  and  demonstration
for  medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks.  Eaton  is  pursuing  a  number
of  development  and  demonstration  projects  directly  and  with  part-
ners such as the Department of Energy. With this energy the focus
must not be only on batteries but also on chargers and electrication
of  the  accessories  that  will  be  critical  to  the  success  of  this  tech-
nology.

A  few  comments  on  battery  system  development  challenges.  The
success  of  the  hybrid  market  is  tied  to  the  development  and  com-
mercialization of state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries. The develop,
manufacturing,  and  assembly  methodologies  needed  to  allow  for
the  wide  range  of  vehicle  sizes  and  unique  configurations  needed
in the world of, I am sorry. The wide range of vehicle size and the
unique  configurations  needed  in  the  world  of  medium-  and  heavy-
duty trucks.

Remember,  the  benefits  of  hybridization  apply  equally  to  cars
and trucks, although implementation and use of commercial trucks
has unique challenges because of the size of the systems, the oper-
ating environments, and the duty cycles.

Finally, the hybrid truck market and supporting technologies are
still in the early stages of commercialization and long-term leader-
ship  will  be  hotly  contested  worldwide.  U.S.-based  companies  are
currently positioned to be world leaders in development and manu-
facture  of  hybrid  systems,  and  we  can  provide  the  same  benefits
and  solution  for  truck  fleets  around  the  globe,  though  we  must
keep pushing our research efforts forward.

As the Committee debates funding research and development for
hybrid  vehicles,  we  would  urge  that  electric  hybrids,  hybrid  hy-
brids, I am sorry, hydraulic hybrids, and plug-in hybrid systems for
commercial vehicles be included in any such programs.

Once  again,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  appear  today  in
front  of  this  committee  as  a  representative  of  Eaton  Corporation.

Eaton Hybrid Truck Power Systems

Following years of successful development and extensive real-world testing, Eaton
has emerged as a market leader in the development and production of hybrid power
systems  for  commercial  vehicle  fleets.  Eaton  is  currently  offering  hybrid  electric
products for commercial vehicles applications and our hybrid hydraulic products will
enter  the  market  this  year.  Our  hybrid  power  systems  are  being  tested  and  used
in the United States by companies such as FedEx, UPS, Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola.
Eaton’s  diesel-electric  hybrid  power  system  is  currently  engineered  as  a  production
option in North America for Peterbilt, Kenworth, International and Freightliner and
we are working with leading European manufacturers like DAF Trucks and Daimler
Trucks for potential introduction in Europe.

Eaton has invested in three separate hybrid power solutions for commercial vehi-

cles:

• Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV)
• Hybrid Hydraulic Vehicles (HHV)
• Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles (PHEV)

Eaton believes that all of these technologies have a place in the truck market. We
will continue to develop these technologies to create a portfolio of hybrid power sys-
tems for a wide variety of vehicles and applications.

Eaton’s  hybrid  power  systems  can  provide  significant  fuel  savings  and  reduce  ve-
hicle emissions. Hybrid power is particularly appealing for Class 5/6 vehicles (Pick-
up  and  Delivery),  Class  7  vehicles  (Utility),  and  Class  8  vehicles  (Over  the  Road
Trucks)—all  large  trucks  with  weights  exceeding  16,000  pounds,  especially  in  stop-
and-go applications.

Hybrid  power  provides  further  savings  through  engine-off  operations  and  power
take-off  operations  at  a  work  site.  Whatever  the  application,  hybrid  power  can  pro-
vide  significant  fuel  savings,  increased  functionality,  quieter  operation,  and  im-
proved performance.

Currently,  the  U.S.  stands  poised  to  lead  the  world  in  hybrid  power  for  trucks.
Our  Hybrid  Drive  Systems  are  being  developed  and  engineered  at  our  facilities  in
Michigan  and  Minnesota  and  then  our  systems  are  produced  in  Indiana  and  Iowa.
Eaton is the first Tier One Supplier of Truck components to produce for sale HEV
systems to the Truck OEM market. We are the only hybrid power system to be cer-
tified by the IRS for the medium- and heavy-duty hybrid tax credit that was enacted
in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

Our  medium-duty  hybrid  electric  vehicles  are  achieving  between  20  percent  and

70 percent fuel economy gains depending upon the truck application.

Early this year, Eaton Corporation agreed to sell 207 diesel-electric hybrid power
systems  to  Guangzhou  Armada  Development  Corporation  to  be  installed  in  new
buses for operation in the city of Guangzhou, China. This purchase adds to the ini-
tial  sales  of  30  Eaton  hybrid-powered  buses  announced  in  January  as  part  of  the
U.S. Department of Commerce Clean Energy Trade Mission to China.

It  is  Eaton’s  largest  single  hybrid  power  systems  order  to  date.  Additionally,
Eaton Corporation recently received orders from United Parcel Service for 200 units
while Coca Cola Enterprises ordered 120 hybrid units. These sales make Eaton Cor-
poration the world leader in hybrid power sales in the commercial truck market.

Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV)

To produce Eaton’s patented parallel hybrid electric system; we couple a vehicle’s

diesel engine with an electric motor/generator, power electronics and batteries.

Hybrid  electric  systems  have  much  higher  energy  storage  capacity,  and  generally
have low to moderate power capabilities compared to hydraulic hybrids. Hybrid elec-
tric systems can provide engine off PTO capability for applications needing work site
hydraulic  operations  and  an  auxiliary  electric  power  source  from  the  vehicle.  This

21

is valuable in vehicles whose workday takes them off the highway and to a job site,
where the truck’s power is used to operate other tools and equipment.

Hybrid  electric  vehicles  also  require  an  unprecedented  level  of  integration  and
partnership  between  truck  makers,  engine  manufacturers  and  suppliers  of  the
drivetrain and major electrical components. Eaton’s strategy includes early and sig-
nificant  collaboration  with  truck  OEMs,  engine  manufacturers  and  key  technology
and component suppliers.
The  hybrid  electric  system  maintains  conventional  drivetrain  architecture—such
as  Eaton’s  Fuller  UltraShift  automated  transmissions—while  adding  the  ability
to  augment  engine  torque  with  electrical  torque.  The  system  recovers  energy  nor-
mally  lost  during  braking  and  stores  the  energy  in  batteries.  When  electric  torque
is  blended  with  engine  torque,  the  stored  energy  is  used  to  improve  fuel  economy
and  vehicle  performance  for  a  given  speed  or  used  to  operate  the  vehicle  with  elec-
tric power only.

This integrated system delivers a number of benefits, including:

• Up to 60 percent reduction in fuel consumption
• Up to 87 percent reduction in idle times
• Reduced maintenance and lower life cycle costs
• Reduced emissions
• Quieter operations and better acceleration

The system can also be designed to provide energy for use during engine-off work
site  operations.  As  an  additional  benefit  of  the  parallel  architecture,  should  the  hy-
brid system go off-line, conventional engine-powered operation continues.

Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicles (HHV)—Parallel and Series

In a parallel hybrid hydraulic system, the conventional vehicle powertrain is sup-
plemented  by  the  addition  of  the  hydraulic  system.  The  system  is  best  suited  for
vehicles  that  operate  in  stop-and-go  duty  cycles,  including  refuse  vehicles,  pickup
and delivery vehicles, and buses, where fuel economy improvements between 20 per-
cent and 30 percent are typical. Eaton plans to commercialize its parallel hybrid hy-
draulic system in refuse trucks in 2008. Other applications will soon follow.

In a series hybrid hydraulic system, the conventional vehicle driveline is replaced
by  the  hybrid  system.  The  conventional  transmission  and  driveline  are  replaced  by
the  hybrid  hydraulic  powertrain  and  energy  is  transferred  from  the  engine  to  the
drive  wheels  through  fluid  power.  The  system  is  suited  to  a  broader  number  of  ap-
plications  than  parallel  hydraulic  hybrids,  though—as  with  all  hybrids—benefits
will be highest in vehicles that operate in stop-and-go duty cycles.

Eaton is working with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under a Coop-
erative  Research  and  Development  agreement,  to  develop  a  series  hydraulic  hybrid
power  system  that  combines  a  high-efficiency  diesel  engine  and  a  unique  hydraulic
propulsion system to replace the conventional drivetrain and transmission.

The series hybrid engine continually operates at its ‘‘sweet spot’’ of fuel consump-
tion facilitated by the continuously variable transmission (CVT) functionality of the
series hybrid system and by regenerative braking. The vehicle uses hydraulic pump/
motors  and  hydraulic  storage  tanks  to  recover  and  store  energy,  similar  to  what  is
done with electric motors and batteries in hybrid electric vehicles.

These  vehicles  can  achieve  a  fuel  economy  improvement  between  50  and  70  per-

cent by:

erating.

• braking energy that normally is wasted is recovered and reused;
• the engine is operated more efficiently; and
• the  engine  can  be  shut  off  when  not  needed,  such  as  when  stopped  or  decel-

Currently,  Eaton  is  engaged  in  a  program  supported  by  the  U.S.  Army  to  milita-
rize  this  drive  train  to  provide  power  and  fuel  efficiency  to  military  vehicle  drive
trains.

Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)

Eaton is currently working with the Electric Power and Research Institute (EPRI)
to  develop  commercial  PHEV  trucks.  However,  plug-in  Hybrid  technology  is  in  the
very early stages of development for heavy duty trucks.

PHEV  vehicles  require  a  notably  higher  energy  storage  capability  then  current
medium  or  light  duty  production  systems  in  order  to  maximize  benefits  of  plug  in
capability.  Higher  energy  storage  battery  systems  facilitate  the  on  vehicle  energy
storage  necessary  to  move  towards  full  electric  vehicle  capability  (critical  for  zero

22

emission  and  noise  restriction  areas).  This  would  also  require  work  on  electrifying
the accessories inside the vehicle (e.g., steering, brakes, HVAC).

In  addition,  we  are  working  with  members  of  the  Hybrid  Truck  Users  Forum
(HTUF)  such  as  Southern  California  Edison,  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric,  and  Florida
Power  and  Light  to  develop  a  PHEV  for  use  in  utility  truck  applications.  We  are
also working with Navistar on a proposal for a Department of Energy funded PHEV
truck project.

Needed Enabling Technologies

Successful  deployment  of  hybrid  vehicles  is  dependent  on  the  availability  of  high
power  output  and  high  energy  storage  devices.  Today,  the  Lithium  Ion  battery  rep-
resents  the  most  promising  technology  for  hybrid  electric  vehicles.  However,  these
types of batteries significantly increase the complexity and cost of the system. Addi-
tionally, robust battery management systems are needed to ensure safe and reliable
operation.

Managing  the  charge  and  discharge  process  within  the  battery  pack  to  optimize
service  life  and  reliability,  as  well  as  monitoring,  predicting,  diagnosing  and  miti-
gating potentially unsafe conditions, are challenges that must be overcome. The use
of high voltage DC batteries (400–600 volts) in vehicles poses a set of challenges not
normally seen on commercial vehicles.

For Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicles, the Accumulator provides the same energy storage
function as a battery. Today’s accumulator technology is adequate for certain appli-
cations.  But  to  achieve  widespread  adoption  of  hybrids,  an  increase  in  the  energy
storage capacity is needed.

Challenges and Opportunities

The  U.S.  is  far  behind  in  the  development  and  commercialization  of  state-of-the-
art,  ‘‘plug  and  play’’  lithium  ion  battery  systems  for  HEV  and  PHEV  applications
that  are  affordable,  reliable  and  safe.  The  assembly  and  manufacturing  methodolo-
gies need to be modular and flexible, in order to cater to a range of vehicle size and
configuration needed in the world of medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Unfortunately,
there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution for trucks.

The  benefits  of  hybridization  apply  equally  to  cars  and  trucks,  although  imple-
mentation and use in commercial trucks is significantly more complex. For example,
the battery packs are larger, often must be located on the exterior of trucks (exposed
to  the  elements)  and  the  duty  cycles  are  much  more  demanding,  since  commercial
vehicles  are  typically  driven  for  12–16  hours  a  day  versus  cars  that  are  normally
used for commuting and hence driven only a few hours a day.

Phasing in the next generation lithium ion batteries to make PHEVs a reality will
require  significantly  more  effort.  Any  significant  effort  towards  accelerating  the
market  appeal  and  penetration  of  hybrid  vehicles  in  the  U.S.  by  developing  state-
of-the-art  technologies  and  systems  will  provide  huge  impetus  to  the  endeavor  to-
wards energy conservation and pollution reduction.

A  major  threat  to  the  widespread  adoption  of  hybrid  vehicles  (particularly  the
PHEVs) is the high cost of implementation of the fairly large battery systems need-
ed,  as  well  as  the  reliability  and  life  of  the  energy  storage  systems.  Developing  a
flexible  and  robust  system  to  leverage  multiple  cell  suppliers  and  reach  the  nec-
essary economies of scale will go a long way toward reducing implementation costs.

Conclusion

The  hybrid  truck  market  is  in  its  infancy  and  the  jury  is  still  out  as  to  who  will
lead the world in this space. Investment in Research and Development will help re-
duce our dependence on foreign oil, help truck fleets big and small mitigate the cost
of fuel and reduce emission here at home. In fact, these are the types of technologies
that  can  lead  to  a  leadership  position  for  the  United  States  in  the  manufacture  of
hybrid  truck  technologies.  We  can  provide  these  same  benefits  and  solutions  to
truck fleets around the globe.

As the Committee debates funding research and development for hybrid vehicles,
we would urge that electric hybrid, hydraulic hybrid, and plug-in hybrid systems be
included in such a program. Battery and accumulator technologies need to be devel-
oped  specifically  for  commercial  vehicles  because  their  size,  weight,  duty  cycle  and
energy storage requirement are unique from those storage systems being developed
for passenger vehicles. It only makes sense to include commercial trucks in the mix.
With  proper  investment,  the  United  States  could  lead  the  world  in  these  new  and
exciting technologies.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Dalum, you are recognized for five minutes.
STATEMENT OF MR. JOSEPH T. DALUM, VICE PRESIDENT,

DUECO

Mr.  DALUM.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Mem-
ber Inglis, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. Thank
you for inviting me here today. Also, thank you for the opportunity
to offer the views of Dueco and for soliciting the views of others on
hybrid  technologies  for  medium-  to  heavy-duty  commercial  trucks.
My  name  is  Joe  Dalum,  and  I  am  Vice  President  of  Dueco.
Dueco,  headquartered  in  Waukesha,  Wisconsin,  is  one  of  the  larg-
est  final  stage  manufacturers  of  utility  trucks  in  the  country.  We
produce aerial devices, digger derricks, and cranes that are sold to
electric utilities for the maintenance of their transmission and dis-
tribution  power  lines.  Dueco  also  provides  equipment  and  services
for  the  telecommunications  market,  other  industries,  and  the  gov-
ernment.

In  2006,  Dueco  began  to  assess  alternative  hybrid  vehicle  tech-
nologies.  Those  activities  led  to  a  collaborative  development  pro-
gram between Dueco and Odyne Corporation. Odyne is a developer
of  plug-in  hybrid  electric  vehicle  powertrains  for  Class  six,  seven,
and  eight  vehicles.  Our  efforts  resulted  in  the  introduction  of  the
utility  industry’s  first  pre-production  plug-in  hybrid  medium-duty
truck in the fall of 2007.

While you have already received my more extensive written testi-
mony, this morning I will focus on our development of a plug-in hy-
brid  medium-duty  truck.  There  are  several  factors  that  favor  the
development  and  deployment  of  hybrid  and  plug-in  hybrid  trucks:
rising  fuel  prices,  increased  pressure  for  environmentally-friendly
and  green  operations  with  lower  carbon  emissions,  a  national  pri-
ority  to  reduce  foreign  oil  dependency,  and  increased  maintenance
costs.

In our company’s opinion, plug-in hybrid technology for medium-
and  heavy-duty  trucks  is  particularly  well  suited  to  addressing
those challenges. In my written testimony you will find a more de-
tailed explanation of the factors that support that position.

I  will  now  discuss  our  experience  with  the  plug-in  medium-duty
truck.  A  photo  of  a  plug-in  medium,  heavy-duty  truck  is  shown  on
the  screen.  This  type  of  truck  is  typically  used  by  utilities  for  the
maintenance  and  installation  of  power  lines.  It  is  unique  in  that  a
very large battery system of approximately 35 kilowatt hours, more
than  15  times  larger  than  one  used  in  a  conventional  hybrid,  pro-
vides power to help propel the vehicle, along with the diesel engine.
The battery system also provides power for equipment on and off
the truck. When the truck returns to the garage, domestically-gen-
erated grid power recharges the battery system, offsetting the need
for petroleum. The size of the battery system and the ability to re-
charge  using  grid  power  differentiates  the  plug-in  hybrid  system
from  a  conventional  hybrid.  Using  the  large  grid  rechargeable  bat-
tery system reduces fuel consumption and emissions during driving
and  provides  for  an  all-electric  stationary  mode.  The  system  com-
pletely  eliminates  fuel  consumption  and  emissions  at  the  job  site
for a typical day, while also reducing noise.

Fuel  savings  and  corresponding  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas
emissions  are  dependent  upon  the  application.  The  current  vehicle
reduces fuel consumption by an estimated 1,400 gallons of fuel per
vehicle per year for a typical utility application. I am confident ad-
ditional research can further improve fuel savings.

In my opinion there will be a time in the future when affordable
plug-in  hybrid  systems  for  a  medium  or  heavy-duty  truck  provides
100  percent  electrical  operation  for  a  limited  driving  range,  com-
pletely  eliminating  fuel  consumption  and  reducing  emissions  when
recharged  by  clean  electricity  produced  through  renewable  or  non-
emitting domestic energy sources.

There  are  several  technical  hurdles  to  the  deployment  of  plug-in
hybrid  trucks.  Battery  system  costs  and  performance  challenges,
non-optimal  powertrain  architecture,  questions  about  utility  infra-
structure for charging large fleets of trucks with high capacity bat-
tery systems, and a lack of information about specific medium- and
heavy-duty applications need to be overcome.

Dueco  encourages  the  Federal  Government  to  develop  programs
that help to specifically fund research into the development of plug-
in hybrid systems for medium- and heavy-duty trucks used in spe-
cific  applications  that  are  open  to  final-stage  manufacturers  and
other entities. Assistance with testing, certification, the creation of
tax  incentives  for  customers,  and  modification  of  government  pur-
chasing policies to favor the acquisition of more fuel-efficient trucks
using  plug-in  hybrid  technology  can  also  accelerate  development
and deployment.

Commercial  fleets  consume  large  amounts  of  fuel;  developing
more  efficient  trucks  that  utilize  domestically-sourced  power  from
the  Nation’s  energy  grid  would  have  several  benefits.  The  develop-
ment  of  this  technology  in  the  United  States  would  provide  oppor-
tunities  for  job  creation,  export  opportunities,  reduce  the  cost  of
businesses  competing  in  a  global  market,  reduce  greenhouse  gas
emissions and emissions of other pollutants, reduce dependency on

foreign  oil,  reduce  noise  within  our  cities,  and  potentially  improve
productivity  for  certain  applications,  such  as  crews  who  could  per-
form work at night in residential areas.

This  is  potentially  a  historic  opportunity  to  develop  the  tech-
nology  needed  for  the  electrification  of  medium-  and  heavy-duty
trucks. I would ask for your support of the proposed legislation that
would help to accelerate research into plug-in hybrid technology for
medium- and heavy-duty trucks and encourage the development of
partnerships between manufacturers and utilities.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSEPH T. DALUM

Introduction

Good  morning  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member,  Inglis  and  distinguished
Members  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Science  and  Technology.  Thank  you  for  inviting
me here today. Also thank you for the opportunity to offer the views of DUECO and
for  soliciting  the  views  of  others  on  hybrid  technologies  for  medium  to  heavy  duty
commercial trucks.

My  name  is  Joe  Dalum,  and  I  am  Vice  President  of  DUECO.  Headquartered  in
Waukesha, Wisconsin, DUECO is one of the largest final stage manufactures of util-
ity  trucks  in  the  country,  with  facilities  also  located  in  South  Dakota,  Minnesota,
Indiana,  Ohio  and  Pennsylvania.  We  produce  aerial  devices,  digger  derricks  and
cranes  that  are  sold  to  electric  utilities  for  the  maintenance  of  their  transmission
and  distribution  power  lines  in  a  15-state  region  and  are  also  used  by  utilities
throughout the country through UELC, our rental and leasing company, with direct
facilities  in  Florida,  Texas  and  California.  DUECO  also  provides  equipment  and
services  for  the  telecommunications,  contractor,  electric  cooperative,  municipality,
gas utility and tree care markets.

In  2006,  DUECO  began  to  assess  alternative  hybrid  vehicle  technologies.  Those
activities lead to a collaborative development program between DUECO and Odyne
Corporation.  Odyne  Corporation  is  a  developer  of  Plug-In  Hybrid  Electric  Vehicle
(PHEV) power trains for Class 6, 7 and 8 vehicles. Our efforts resulted in the intro-
duction  of  the  utility  industry’s  first  commercial  plug-in  hybrid  medium  duty  truck
in the Fall of 2007.

Background

Medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks,  used  by  the  utility  industry  are  typically  built
in  multiple  stages.  During  the  first  stage  an  original  equipment  manufacturer
builds  an  incomplete  vehicle,  commonly  known  as  a  chassis.  The  vehicle  is  then
often  completed  by  a  final  stage  manufacturer.  Final  stage  manufacturers  typically
evaluate  the  intended  application  of  the  vehicle,  perform  engineering  analysis,  and
then install an appropriate body, equipment and interface components with chassis
systems in a manufacturing operation.

Hybrid drive systems may be installed by an original equipment manufacturer or
by  another  entity  during  an  intermediate  or  final  stage  of  manufacturing  process.
DUECO installs the plug-in hybrid drive system and interfaces the system with the
chassis and installed equipment during the latter stage of manufacturing.

Hybrid drive systems may be installed only on newly manufactured truck chassis
or  some  designs  may  facilitate  either  an  installation  on  a  new  chassis  or  a  retro-
fit  on  an  existing  chassis  for  certain  applications.  The  plug-in  hybrid  system  devel-
oped by DUECO and Odyne can be either installed during the manufacturing proc-
ess of a new truck or it can be installed as a retro-fit on an existing chassis. Retro-
fit applications must be carefully engineered, installation of a system on an existing
truck requires sufficient payload, packaging space and specific chassis data commu-
nications interfaces.

Trucks  used  by  utilities  typically  drive  to  a  job  site  and  then  conduct  stationary
operations.  In  a  conventional  truck,  the  diesel  or  gas  powered  engine  provides  the
sole  source  of  propulsion  for  the  vehicle  and  is  also  used  to  power  truck  mounted
equipment,  such  as  an  aerial  device,  digger  derrick,  crane,  compressor,  winch  or
other equipment. While at the job site, the vehicle may idle for many hours to pro-
vide power for the equipment and provide heat or air conditioning in the cab. A me-
dium  duty  truck  may  average  approximately  eight  mpg  while  being  driven  and
while at idle will typically consume approximately one gallon per hour.

A  plug-in  hybrid  electric  vehicle  (PHEV)  is  a  hybrid  vehicle  with  batteries  that
can  be  recharged  by  plugging  into  our  nation’s  electric  power  grid.  It  shares  the
characteristics of both conventional hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehi-
cles, having an internal combustion engine and batteries for power.

Hybrid systems used in larger trucks, greater than Class 4, have typically utilized

two basic design configurations—a series design or a parallel design.

Series design configurations typically use an internal combustion engine (heat en-
gine) with a generator to produce electricity for both the battery pack and the elec-
tric motor. There is typically no direct mechanical power connection between the in-
ternal  combustion  engine  and  the  wheels  in  an  electric  series  design.  Series  design
hybrids  often  have  the  benefit  of  having  a  no-idle  system,  include  an  engine-driven
generator  that  enables  optimum  engine  performance,  typically  lack  a  transmission
(on  some  models),  and  accommodate  a  variety  of  options  for  mounting  the  engine
and other components. However, series design hybrids also generally include a larg-
er,  heavier  battery;  have  a  greater  demand  on  the  engine  to  maintain  the  battery
charge; and include inefficiencies due to the multiple energy conversions.

Parallel  design  configurations  have  a  direct  mechanical  connection  between  the
internal  combustion  engine  and  the  wheels  in  addition  to  an  electric  or  hydraulic
motor to drive the wheels. Parallel design hybrids have the benefit of being capable
of  increased  power  due  to  simultaneous  use  of  the  engine  and  electric  motor  or  hy-
draulic  motor,  having  a  smaller  engine  with  improved  fuel  economy  while  avoiding
compromised acceleration power, and increasing efficiency by having minimal reduc-
tion or conversion or power when the internal combustion engine is directly coupled
to the driveshaft, typically through a transmission. However, parallel design hybrids
typically lack a no-idle system and may have non-optimal engine operation (e.g., low
rpm  or  high  transient  loads)  under  certain  circumstances.  Existing  systems  on
trucks  of  Class  4  or  higher  have  traditionally  not  had  a  system  that  combines  the
benefits of a series system and a parallel system.

DUECO  has  produced  plug-in  hybrid  electric  trucks,  hybrid  electric  trucks  and

conventionally powered trucks for the utility industry.

The need for plug-in hybrid and conventional hybrid trucks:

There are several factors that favor the development and use of hybrid and plug-

in hybrid trucks:

• Rising fuel prices.
• Increased  pressure  for  environmentally  friendly  and  green  operations  with

lower carbon emissions.

• A national priority to reduce foreign oil dependency.
• Increased maintenance costs.

Differences  between  plug-in  hybrid  electric  trucks  and  hybrid  electric

trucks:

The  following  compares  some  of  the  benefits  of  a  plug-in  hybrid  to  that  of  a  con-
ventional  hybrid.  The  primary  difference  between  the  plug-in  hybrid  and  the  con-
ventional  hybrid  is  the  size  of  the  battery  system  and  the  ability  to  recharge  the
battery system from the domestic power grid.

While  a  plug-in  hybrid  truck  offers  some  of  the  same  benefits  as  a  conventional

hybrid truck, plug-in hybrids offer advantages in several areas:

• Reduced fuel consumption

• A  plug-in  hybrid  system  has  a  large  battery  system  that  operates  in  a
charge  depleting  mode.  The  energy  from  the  battery  is  typically  used  to
help  propel  the  vehicle  and  operate  equipment.  Energy  required  to  re-
charge the battery is ideally provided by the power grid or from regenera-
tive  braking,  displacing  the  use  of  petroleum.  A  vehicle  with  a  large
enough  battery  system  could  potentially  eliminate  fuel  consumption  by
operating  in  an  all  electric  driving  mode  for  a  limited  distance  and  oper-
ating  in  an  all  electric  stationary  mode.  All  electric  trucks  are  available
in  Europe,  while  there  are  disadvantages  such  as  limited  range;  electric
trucks  demonstrate  that  the  technology  is  available  for  emission  free  op-
eration.
• A  conventional  hybrid  typically  uses  power  from  the  diesel  and  gas  en-
gine to recharge the battery or may be recharged from regenerative brak-
ing.  Since  much  of  the  energy  in  the  battery  system  results  from  re-
charging through the engine, fuel consumption may be higher.

• Reduced emissions, potentially eliminates emissions at the job site.

27

• A  plug-in  hybrid  typically  reduces  fuel  consumption  and  corresponding
CO2 emissions during urban driving and has a large battery system that
can  allow  the  engine  to  stay  off  the  entire  day  at  the  job  site.  The  large
battery  system  is  used  to  power  truck  mounted  equipment  such  as  an
aerial  device  or  electrically  powered  air  conditioning  system.  Electricity
to  recharge  the  battery  system  may  be  generated  by  sources  with  lower
emissions;  some  utilities  generate  a  sizable  portion  of  power  from  non-
emitting  sources.  As  an  example,  PG&E  generates  over  50  percent  of
their energy from renewable sources.
• A  conventional  hybrid  due  to  a  smaller  battery  system  often  may  need
to  restart  the  engine  at  the  job  site  to  recharge  the  battery  and  may  not
have  enough  energy  in  the  battery  system  to  power  large  loads,  such  as
an  electrically  driven  air  conditioner,  with  the  engine  off.  When  the  en-
gine is started periodically for short durations in the field to recharge the
smaller battery system, emission systems may not be at optimal effective-
ness, potentially resulting in greater emissions of harmful pollutants.

• Lower noise levels during stationary operations.

• The  engine  typically  stays  off  with  a  plug-in  hybrid,  resulting  in  lower
noise  levels.  A  conventional  hybrid  may  require  the  engine  to  restart  to
charge the batteries.

• Uses  low  cost,  domestically  produced  energy  from  the  Nation’s  electric  grid.
• Off-sets fuel consumption by displacing petroleum with electricity. Ability

to recharge at off-peak hours.

• Maintains a charge or is recharged at any time with conventional engine.

• While  a  plug-in  hybrid  is  typically  designed  to  deplete  the  charge  in  the
battery  system  and  recharge  through  the  grid,  the  system  can  be  de-
signed  to  maintain  a  minimum  state  of  charge  in  the  battery  system  by
recharging through the engine if needed. This allows extended operations
in  the  field  during  situations  where  it  is  impossible  to  recharge  through
the grid. In other words, while it is desirable to recharge a plug-in hybrid
through the grid, it is not necessary to plug it in. Charging using the en-
gine is similar to how a conventional hybrid recharges.

• Improved vehicle acceleration.

• Electric motors provide additional power and torque to the drive train of
the  truck.  The  larger  battery  system  of  a  plug-in  hybrid  provides  more
energy for extended use of the electric motor. The smaller battery system
of  a  conventional  hybrid  may  become  depleted  more  quickly,  reducing
available power when needed for climbing grades or other demanding sit-
uations.

• Standby power capability: option for 9 kW or more exportable power for appli-
cations  such  as  job  site  power  tools,  lighting  and  temporary  restoration  of
power to facilities.

• The  large  battery  system  of  a  plug-in  hybrid  offers  the  ability  to  export
power  from  the  vehicle  for  external  uses.  In  the  more  distant  future  it
may  be  possible  to  export  power  from  the  vehicle  to  the  grid  (Vehicle  to
Grid,  or  V2G)  to  reduce  peak  loads  on  grid  generation  systems.  The
smaller  battery  system  in  a  conventional  hybrid  typically  does  not  have
enough  energy  for  export  without  turning  on  the  engine  to  provide  addi-
tional power.

• Reduced maintenance costs.

• Utility  vehicles  often  are  serviced  based  upon  hours  of  engine  operation.
A plug-in hybrid truck has reduced hours of engine operation, potentially
extending maintenance intervals.

Benefits of Electricity as a Fuel:

A  plug-in  hybrid  electric  truck  uses  electricity  to  supplement  or  replace  the  use

of fossil fuels. There are several benefits to using electricity as a fuel.

• Feed Stock diversity promotes stability

• A  portion  of  our  nation’s  existing  generation  fuel  mix  is  currently  CO2 free.
Æ Example:  approximately  56  percent  of  PG&E’s  energy  portfolio  is  CO2

free

• Recent and ongoing legislation promotes cleaner generation mix over time

Æ Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) legislation enacted in 21 states

• Low fuel cost and minimal additional infrastructure required

Æ Preferential rates for off-peak consumption

• Projected  future  renewable  energy  sources  tend  to  be  an  off-peak  energy  re-

source

Æ Wind can often produce more energy at night

Plug-in Hybrid Electric Truck, bucket truck application:

A  plug-in  hybrid  electric  medium  duty  bucket  truck  is  shown  above.  This  type  of
truck  is  typically  used  by  utilities  of  maintenance  and  installation  of  power  lines.
The  truck  has  many  of  the  benefits  listed  previously.  Specifically  this  vehicle  has
the following features:

• Hybrid launch assist and regenerative braking
• All Electric Operation at a job site for a typical day
• 35  kWh  Energy  storage  (note:  a  traditional  hybrid  may  have  two  kWh  of  en-

ergy storage)

• Electrically powered hydraulic system moves Aerial lift & outriggers, this

function is also known as E–PTO

• Electrically powered air conditioning

• 110/220VAC Electric shore power nine kW, more optional
• Interfaces  with  an  Allison  transmission,  the  system  may  also  interface  with
other  transmissions  (testing  with  other  transmissions  has  not  been  com-
pleted)

• Modular design with standard components
• Enhanced reliability with redundant power for critical operations
• Advanced  diagnostics  &  data  acquisition  available,  ability  to  monitor  vehicle

via satellite

• Very versatile design:

• Basic system design can be used on for a variety of truck weight Classes:
5,  6,  7,  8  (19,500  -  >  33,000  GVWR).  Testing  of  the  system  on  Class  5
and Class 7 trucks has begun, testing on Class 6 and Class 8 is planned
within the next year.

• Basic design can be used on a variety of chassis configurations: 2x4, 4x4,
tandem. Testing has begun on the two-wheel drive application, testing on
the  tandem  will  begin  within  the  next  year.  Testing  on  the  4x4  has  not
been scheduled.

• System  should  be  able  to  interface  with  multiple  power  trains  from  mul-
tiple  chassis  manufacturers.  Testing  has  begun  on  GMC  and  Inter-
national units and on chassis with gas and diesel engines.

• Ability to tow trailer.
• No special diagnostic software.
• Enhances stability of vehicle for aerial device applications.
• Utilities can power their fleet with their own fuel: Electricity

Fuel savings are dependent upon the application. The current vehicle reduces fuel
consumption during driving in urban areas by approximately 10–15 percent. The ve-
hicle  will  typically  save  100  percent  of  fuel  consumption  during  stationary  oper-
ations at a job site, resulting in approximately one gallon per hour reduction. There
is little to no fuel savings during higher speed highway driving.

Anticipated  fuel  savings  for  a  plug-in  hybrid  in  comparison  to  a  conventional
truck depend upon many factors such as the type of system architecture, size of bat-
tery and field application. The following is an estimate for two types of plug-in sys-
tems, one with parallel system architecture and one with series system architecture.
The  sample  application  is  a  20-mile  drive,  a  five-hour  idling  period,  and  an  addi-
tional 20-mile drive.

Parallel system with plug-in battery system compared to a conventional truck:

Stated Assumptions:
Conventional  chassis:  approximately  eight  mpg  fuel  efficiency  during  driving
and approximately one gallon per hour fuel consumption during idle.
Parallel  system  with  plug-in:  approximately  12  percent  decrease  in  fuel  con-
sumption  for  a  plug-in  hybrid  during  driving  and  0  gallons  per  hour  fuel  con-
sumption during idle.
Estimated  fuel  savings:  56  percent  reduction  in  fuel  consumption,  or  approxi-
mately 1,400 gallons of fuel saved per year, based upon 250 work days per year.

Series system with plug-in battery system compared to a conventional truck:

Stated Assumptions:
Conventional  chassis:  approximately  eight  mpg  fuel  efficiency  during  driving
and approximately one gallon per hour fuel consumption during idle.
Series system with plug-in: 50 percent decrease in fuel consumption for a plug-
in  hybrid  during  driving  and  0  gallons  per  hour  fuel  consumption  during  idle.
Estimated  fuel  savings:  75  percent  reduction  in  fuel  consumption,  or  approxi-
mately 1,875 gallons of fuel saved per year, based upon 250 work days per year.
Due  to  the  large  amount  of  savings,  medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks  with  plug-
in  hybrid  technology  may  be  able  to  reach  an  attractive  return-on-investment  more
quickly than other vehicles.

A  diagram  of  a  plug-in  hybrid  electric  system  for  a  truck  is  shown  below.  Elec-
trical  energy  is  used  to  increase  efficiency  while  driving  through  hybrid  launch  as-
sist  and  regenerative  braking.  Electrical  energy  also  powers  equipment  loads  at  a
job site, potentially eliminating the need to run the engine.

Major technical hurdles for deployment of plug-in hybrid trucks:

There  are  several  technical  hurdles  for  the  deployment  of  plug-in  hybrid  trucks.

Battery system technology:

Existing  battery  technology  either  tends  to  offer  battery  systems  that  are  rel-
atively low cost, but heavy, large and of limited life or are relatively expensive, but
much  lighter,  smaller  and  with  potentially  longer  life.  While  certain  applications  of
trucks may be able to carry lower cost, heavier battery systems, it is generally desir-
able to minimize battery system weight, size and cost. Development of cost effective
larger  advanced  battery  systems,  potentially  with  energy  storage  in  excess  of  35
kWh, or even in excess of 100 kWh, would improve the performance and reduce the
operating cost of plug-in hybrid trucks.

In  order  to  accelerate  deployment  of  plug-in  hybrid  trucks  using  existing  tech-
nology,  it  may  be  desirable  to  design  battery  systems  that  are  modular,  that  allow
for  newer  technology  battery  systems  to  be  placed  on  existing  vehicles  when  the
original battery system no longer performs to acceptable standards.

System architecture:

Existing  hybrid  systems  for  trucks  tend  to  utilize  system  architectures  that  are
similar  in  many  ways  to  that  of  existing  truck  power  trains.  The  internal  combus-
tion  engine  typically  remains  operating  while  the  vehicle  is  driven  to  power  auxil-
iary loads such as power steering systems, brake systems and HVAC systems. Keep-
ing the engine running while stationary or in low speed stop and go traffic increases
fuel  consumption.  Some  vehicles  also  do  not  have  a  clutch  in  between  the  internal
combustion  engine  and  the  transmission.  While  such  systems  utilize  an  automatic
transmission,  it  may  be  desirable  to  create  a  method  to  uncouple  from  the  trans-
mission  from  the  engine  for  improved  regenerative  braking  or  an  all-electric  drive
mode.

In  order  to  improve  fuel  economy  further,  different  system  architectures  that  are
designed  for  high  volume  production  in  which  the  internal  combustion  engine  can
remain off during driving need to be developed. The development of electrically driv-
en  sub-systems  such  as  braking,  power  steering,  HVAC  and  others  need  to  be
brought to high volume production for medium- and heavy-duty trucks.

Existing  parallel  hybrid  electric  vehicle  systems  for  trucks  also  tend  to  use  rel-
atively  small  electric  drive  components  with  relatively  low  power  output,  compared
to  the  power  provided  by  the  internal  combustions  engine.  Larger  electric  motors
and  higher  capacity  battery  systems  may  allow  smaller  engines  to  be  used  that  op-
erate  at  higher  efficiency  without  a  reduction  in  vehicle  performance,  or  allow  the
vehicle  to  be  driven  entirely  by  electric  propulsion.  Future  system  architectures
could also combine the benefits of plug-in hybrid technology, which requires battery
systems  with  high  energy  densities,  with  that  of  hydraulic  hybrids  that  have  high
power densities. The combined plug-in electric hybrid system with hydraulic hybrid
components could offer high horsepower during acceleration and recapture more en-

31

ergy during braking while providing enough energy for sustained operation with the
engine off.

Alternative  power  train  architectures,  such  as  a  combined  series/parallel  hybrid
system with plug-in battery system are also recommended for consideration. A com-
bined  series/parallel  system  would  allow  the  vehicle  to  operate  in  an  all  electric
mode,  a  series  hybrid  configuration  or  a  parallel  hybrid  configuration,  depending
upon which is most advantageous given operating requirements.

Utility infrastructure:

While studies tend to indicate that there is sufficient capacity in the Nation’s en-
ergy  grid  at  off-peak  periods  to  provide  power  for  charging  a  large  number  of  plug-
in  vehicles,  there  has  been  little  testing  on  the  effects  of  charging  a  large  number
of  commercial  plug-in  hybrid  trucks.  A  commercial  fleet  of  1000  vehicles,  each  with
a 35 kWh battery system, could require approximately 25,000 kWh (or 25 MWh) of
power  to  recharge  overnight.  Assessment  and  testing  on  the  effects  of  charging  a
large number of plug-in hybrid trucks is suggested.

Research into specific medium- and heavy-duty applications:

Plug-in  hybrid  technology  for  medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks  may  reduce  fuel
consumption  and  emissions  in  a  wide  variety  of  applications.  Besides  aerial  utility
trucks  and  delivery  trucks,  other  truck  applications  such  as  those  that  use  cranes,
compressors,  welding  equipment,  or  are  used  in  gas  utility  maintenance,  refrigera-
tion, rescue, refuse and construction may benefit from plug-in hybrid technology.

Specific  information  about  the  energy  required  for  various  mobile  and  stationary
applications  is  typically  not  available.  In  order  to  optimize  the  design  of  a  plug-in
hybrid  medium  or  heavy  duty  truck,  it  is  recommended  that  data  be  collected  on
actual fleet utilization, including miles driven, time at idle, power requirements, fuel
consumption  and  other  operational  factors.  The  development  of  plug-in  hybrid  sys-
tems  for  vehicles  that  operate  at  especially  low  efficiency  should  be  a  priority  and
testing should be undertaken to validate improved efficiency and reliability.

DUECO’s  experience  with  government  technology  development  programs

and how the federal role can be enhanced:

Federal  technology  development  programs  focused  on  plug-in  hybrid  systems  for
medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks  have  been  very  limited.  DUECO  has  not  obtained
federal  assistance  in  this  area,  with  the  exception  of  possible  general  research  tax
credits.  Most  of  the  funding  in  this  area  has  focused  on  the  development  of  plug-
in technology for automobiles or has been focused on large original equipment man-
ufacturers.  The  medium-  and  heavy-duty  truck  industry  is  unique  in  that  many  of
its  products  are  often  manufactured  in  multiple  stages  and  brought  to  market  by
companies that are not directly affiliated with the original equipment manufacturer.
DUECO  encourages  the  Federal  Government  to  develop  programs  that  help  to
specifically  fund  research  into  the  development  of  plug-in  hybrid  systems  for
medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks  used  in  specific  applications  and  that  are  open  to
final  stage  manufacturers  and  other  entities.  Assistance  with  testing,  certification,
the  creation  of  tax  incentives  for  customers,  and  modification  of  government  pur-
chasing  policies  to  favor  the  acquisition  of  more  fuel  efficient  trucks  using  plug-in
hybrid technology can also accelerate development and deployment.

Commercial fleets consume large amounts of fuel, developing more efficient trucks
that  utilize  domestically  sourced  power  from  the  Nation’s  energy  grid  would  have
several benefits.

The development of this technology in the United States would provide opportuni-
ties for job creation, export opportunities, reduce the costs for businesses competing
in  a  global  market,  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  emissions  of  other  pollut-
ants, reduce dependency on foreign oil, reduce noise within our cities and potentially
improve  productivity  for  certain  applications,  such  as  electric  crews  who  could  per-
form work at night in residential areas.

This is potentially a historic opportunity to develop the technology needed for the
electrification  of  medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks.  I  would  ask  for  your  support  of
the  proposed  legislation  that  would  help  to  accelerate  research  into  plug-in  hybrid
technology  for  medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks  and  encourage  the  development  of
partnerships between manufacturers and utilities.

STATEMENT OF MS. JILL M. EGBERT, MANAGER, CLEAN AIR

TRANSPORTATION, PACIFIC GAS & ELECTRIC COMPANY

Ms.  EGBERT.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Mem-
ber  Inglis,  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  I  am  very  pleased  to
appear  before  you  this  morning  on  behalf  of  Pacific  Gas  and  Elec-
tric  Company  to  offer  my  views  on  the  important  role  of  medium-
and heavy-duty hybrid and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles.

Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Company,  headquartered  in  San  Fran-
cisco,  California,  is  one  of  the  largest  natural  gas  and  electric
power  utility  companies  in  the  United  States.  The  company  pro-
vides  natural  gas  and  electric  service  to  approximately  15  million
people in northern and central California.

For  nearly  two  decades  PG&E  has  also  actively  worked  to  ad-
vance  alternative  transportation  technologies,  including  natural
gas  and  electric  vehicles.  We  are  particularly  enthusiastic  about
the  incorporation  of  hybrid  and  plug-in  electric  hybrid  medium-
and heavy-duty trucks into our fleet. We have already seen tremen-
dous financial and environmental benefits from doing so.

The  two  most  common  uses  for  integrating  hybrid  and  plug-in
hybrid  electric  trucks  into  our  fleet  are  for  our  so-called  trouble
trucks and more familiar, bucket trucks. PG&E’s trouble trucks are
used  by  our  first  responders  when  an  outage  or  other  situation  is
initially  reported.  These  trucks  operate  within  a  wide  range  of
mileage  parameters,  ranging  from  a  few  miles  if  operated  within
the city of San Francisco, to covering long distances if operating in
more  remote  parts  of  our  service  territory.  This  range  of  operation
makes hybrids an ideal solution for our company and our industry.
For most repair work the utility industry standard is to dispatch
large diesel-powered bucket trucks. These trucks are then required
to idle for long periods of time to complete many necessary repairs,
consuming  one  gallon  of  diesel  per  hour  of  idle  time.  The  idling  is
necessary to maneuver the bucket used to hoist servicemen to per-
form repairs.

In  2007,  PG&E  became  one  of  14  utilities  across  North  America
to  deploy  one  of  24  diesel  electric  hybrid  bucket  trucks  developed
by  the  International  Truck  and  Eaton  Companies.  PG&E’s  field
trial  for  this  new  truck  is  currently  ongoing  in  San  Francisco,  and
preliminary  results  indicate  that  diesel  electric  hybrid  bucket
trucks  reduce  fuel  consumption  by  40  to  60  percent,  reduce  emis-

sions  by  50  to  90  percent,  provide  on-board  power  generating  ca-
pacity  to  power  up  to  five  average-sized  homes  while  service  is
being  restored,  improve  operational  and  scheduling  flexibility,  and
reduce maintenance costs.

In  addition  to  incorporating  these  and  other  new  vehicle  and
truck technologies into our fleet, PG&E has actively participated in
DOE-sponsored workshops by providing a utility company perspec-
tive  on  the  benefits  and  potential  of  all  types  of  plug-in  hybrid  ve-
hicles.

Even  as  new  technology  demonstration  options  are  becoming
available to PG&E at an increasing pace, there remains significant
barriers  to  our  ability  to  more  fully  deploy  the  hybrid  and  plug-in
hybrid  electric  medium-  and  heavy-duty  trucks,  the  most  signifi-
cant  being  financial  barriers.  Currently  the  up-front  cost  of  a  hy-
brid  bucket  truck  is  50  percent  higher  than  a  conventional  bucket
truck. In other words, we could purchase three conventional bucket
trucks for every two hybrids we purchase.

Although  the  lifetime  fuel  and  maintenance  savings  help  make
the investment more attractive and the environmental benefits are
a  key  part  of  our  business  objectives,  the  up-front  costs  are  still
daunting.  In  order  to  accelerate  the  procurement  of  hybrid  trucks
into utility fleets, we believe some financial incentive will be need-
ed in either the form of grants or tax credits. These financial incen-
tives  would  spur  demands  from  PG&E  and  other  utilities  around
the  Nation  that  will  allow  truck  and  power  system  manufacturers
to ultimately bring down their unit costs.

At  a  time  of  historically  high  diesel  prices,  increasing  concerns
over climate change, and energy security, the time is right to accel-
erate  research,  development,  and  deployment  of  hybrid  and  plug-
in hybrid electric truck technologies. With thousands of utilities na-
tionwide, the market for medium- and heavy-duty hybrid and plug-
in  hybrid  electric  trucks  is  very  significant.  PG&E  commends  the
Subcommittee’s  inquiry  into  this  important  market,  and  we  are
hopeful  that  with  effective  government  leadership  the  right  incen-
tives will be implemented to help reduce the financial barriers that
currently  exist  and  that  discourage  widespread,  rapid  deployment
of clean hybrid commercial truck technology.

On  behalf  of  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  Company,  I  want  to  thank
you  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Subcommittee  today.
Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JILL M. EGBERT

Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I
am  very  pleased  to  appear  before  you  this  morning  on  behalf  of  Pacific  Gas  and
Electric  Company  to  offer  my  views  on  the  important  role  of  medium-  and  heavy-

cally  high  diesel  fuel  prices,  increasing  concerns  over  climate  change  and  U.S.  en-
ergy security, I commend the Committee for its leadership in addressing this impor-

Pacific Gas and Electric Company, headquartered in San Francisco, California, is
one  of  the  largest  natural  gas  and  electric  power  utility  companies  in  the  United
States.  The  company  provides  natural  gas  and  electric  service  to  approximately  15
million people throughout a 70,000-square-mile service area in northern and central
California.  PG&E  proudly  delivers  some  of  the  Nation’s  cleanest  energy  to  our  cus-
tomers. On average, more than half of the electricity we deliver to customers comes

from sources that emit no carbon dioxide, or CO2, and an increasing amount comes
from renewable sources of energy.

For  nearly  two  decades,  PG&E  has  also  actively  worked  to  advance  alternative
transportation  technologies,  including  natural  gas  and  electric  vehicles.  More  re-
cently,  the  Company  has  added  diesel-electric  hybrid,  plug-in  hybrid  electric  and
fuel  cell  powered  vehicles  to  its  fleet.  PG&E’s  clean  air  transportation  strategy  is
integrated throughout our fleet and the fleets of many of our customers as well. This
is  a  key  pillar  of  PG&E’s  overall  emissions  reduction  and  environmental  steward-
ship  strategy—no  less  important  than  procuring  clean  sources  of  energy  or  pro-
tecting wildlife habitats.

PG&E  operates  the  largest  natural  gas  alternative  fueled  utility  fleet  in  the  Na-
tion.  Our  fleet  includes  more  than  1,200  natural  gas  fueled  vehicles,  of  which  more
than  100  are  classified  as  medium-  and  heavy-duty  vehicles.  The  majority  of  these
vehicles  run  on  cleaner  burning  compressed  natural  gas.  Over  the  past  ten  years,
PG&E’s  fleet  displaced  over  3.4  million  gallons  of  diesel  and  gasoline  with  natural
gas  which  translates  to  over  6,000  avoided  tons  of  CO2 emissions.  When  combining
our  fleet  with  those  of  more  than  300  of  our  customers  whom  we  have  helped  with
incorporating  alternative  fueled  vehicles  into  their  own  fleets,  the  amount  of  diesel
and  gasoline  displaced  grows  to  more  than  47  million  gallons  and  174,000  tons  of
avoided CO2 emissions over the last three year period alone.1

We  are  particularly  enthusiastic  about  the  incorporation  of  hybrid  and  plug-in
electric hybrid, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, or PHET’s, into our fleet. We have
already  seen  tremendous  financial  and  environmental  benefits  from  doing  so.  Our
goal  in  assessing  and  applying  new  vehicle  power  technologies  is  to  demonstrate
their practical application in our fleet, and gain the experience necessary to provide
our fleet management with alternatives to conventionally fueled vehicles. With each
demonstration  vehicle  and  truck  we  consider  a  number  of  factors,  including  initial
capital cost, operating and long-term fuel costs, ability to meet greenhouse gas emis-
sions  reduction  goals,  reliability  and  serviceability,  operational  flexibility,  fuel  con-
sumption reduction, tailpipe emission reductions consistent with California and fed-
eral regulations, noise pollution reduction and operator safety.

The two most common uses for integrating hybrid and PHET trucks into our fleet
are for our so-called ‘‘trouble trucks,’’ and the more familiar ‘‘bucket trucks.’’ PG&E’s
‘‘trouble trucks’’ are used by our first responders when an outage or other situation
is  initially  reported,  and  are  dispatched  to  assess  a  problem,  and  occasionally  per-
form  minor  repairs  lasting  under  two  hours.  These  trucks  operate  within  a  wide
range of mileage parameters, ranging from a few miles if operated locally within the
City  of  San  Francisco  to  covering  long  distances  if  operating  in  more  remote  parts
of  our  service  territory.  This  range  of  operation  makes  hybrids,  such  as  the  Ford
F550  SuperDuty  hybrid  truck  an  ideal  solution  for  our  company  and  our  industry.
These types of vehicles provide significant benefits which include improved fuel effi-
ciency,  lower  fuel  costs,  and  lower  refueling  time  as  compared  to  our  conventional
trouble trucks. PG&E is currently working with Ford to develop an all plug-in elec-
tric version of the F550 SuperDuty truck.

For  most  repair  work,  the  utility  industry  standard  is  to  dispatch  large  diesel-
powered  bucket  trucks.  These  trucks  are  then  required  to  idle  for  long  periods  of
time to complete many of the necessary repairs which forces a fuel consumption rate
of  approximately  one  gallon  of  diesel  per  hour  of  idle  time.  The  idling  is  necessary
to power the hydraulic arm, which is powered by the engine, to maneuver the buck-
et used to hoist servicemen who perform repairs.

In  2007,  PG&E  became  one  of  14  utilities  across  North  America  to  deploy  one  of
24  diesel-electric  hybrid  bucket  trucks  developed  by  the  International  Truck  and
Eaton Companies. PG&E’s field trial for this new truck is currently ongoing in San
Francisco  with  an  on-board  telematics  system  that  sends  continuous  performance
and operations data which measures efficiency against that of a conventional diesel
truck  being  used  in  the  same  application  and  in  the  same  general  geographic  loca-
tion. Preliminary results indicate that diesel-electric hybrid bucket trucks:

• Reduce fuel consumption by 40–60 percent.

1 These  figures  represent  a  full  ‘‘well-to-wheel’’  analysis,  which  takes  into  account  energy  use
and  emissions  at  every  state  of  the  process,  from  the  moment  the  fuel  is  produced  at  the  well
to  the  moment  the  wheels  are  moved.  Estimates  compare  the  avoided  emissions  from  PG&E’s
CNG  vehicles  to  petroleum  usage  based  on  the  methodology  outlined  in  Full  Fuel  cycle  Assess-
ment  (CEC–600–2007–003,  June  2007),  which  uses  the  Argonne  National  Laboratory’s  GREET
emissions model modified to California inputs.

• Reduce emissions by 50–90 percent by operating the utility bucket in electric-
only  mode  without  the  engine  running.  A  typical  utility  truck’s  engine  runs
eight or more hours a day.
• Provide  on-board  power  generating  capacity  of  25  kilowatts  of  standby
power—enough  to  power  up  to  five  average-size  homes  while  service  is  being
restored.
• Improve  operational  and  scheduling  flexibility,  and  customer  satisfaction  by
operating quietly, particularly when working at night in noise-sensitive areas.
• Reduce  maintenance  costs  due  to  less  engine  use  and  brake  wear  due  to  re-

generative braking capacity that charges the battery.

PG&E  has  also  procured  two  pre-production  heavy  duty  Peterbilt  hybrid  trucks

which will have two buckets per truck, designed specifically for live wire work.

In  addition  to  incorporating  these  and  other  new  vehicle  and  truck  technologies
into our fleet, we also participate actively in industry and government sponsored ini-
tiatives  aimed  at  defining  standards  and  requirements  for  new  hybrid  and  PHET
technology.  PG&E  has  actively  participated  in  DOE  sponsored  workshops  by  pro-
viding  a  utility  company  perspective  on  the  benefits  and  potential  of  all  types  of
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and the potential impacts on the electric power grid
of significant penetrations of such vehicles.

Even  as  new  technology  demonstration  options  are  becoming  available  to  PG&E
at  an  increasing  pace,  there  remain  significant  barriers  to  our  ability  to  more  fully
deploy the hybrid and PHET medium- and heavy-duty trucks—the most significant
being  financial  barriers.  Currently,  the  up-front  cost  of  a  hybrid  bucket  truck  is  50
percent higher than a conventional bucket truck. In other words, we could purchase
three  conventional  bucket  trucks  for  every  two  hybrids  we  purchase.  Though  the
lifetime  fuel  and  maintenance  savings  help  make  the  investment  more  attractive,
and  the  environmental  benefits  are  a  key  part  of  our  business  objectives,  the  up-
front  costs  are  still  daunting.  In  order  to  accelerate  the  procurement  of  hybrid
trucks into utility fleets, therefore, we believe some financial incentive will be need-
ed in either the form of grants or tax credits. These financial incentives would spur
demand from PG&E and other utilities around the Nation that will allow truck and
power  system  manufacturers  to  expand  operations  and  production,  achieve  econo-
mies of scale, and ultimately bring down the unit costs.

At  a  time  of  historically  high  diesel  prices,  increasing  concerns  over  climate
change  and  energy  security,  the  time  is  right  to  accelerate  the  research,  develop-
ment and deployment of hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric truck technologies. With
thousands of utilities nationwide, each deploying a fleet of trucks daily to points far
and wide within their service territory, the market for medium- and heavy-duty hy-
brid  and  plug-in  hybrid  electric  trucks  is  significant.  PG&E  commends  the  Sub-
committee’s  inquiry  into  this  important  market  and  we  are  hopeful  that  with  effec-
tive government leadership, the right incentives will be implemented to help reduce
the financial barriers that currently exist and that discourage widespread, rapid de-
ployment of clean, hybrid commercial truck technology.

On behalf of PG&E, I want to thank you for the opportunity to appear before the

Subcommittee today.

Thank you.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  RICHARD  C.  PARISH,  SENIOR  PROGRAM
MANAGER,  CALSTART  HYBRID  TRUCK  USERS  FORUM
(HTUF), DENVER, COLORADO
Mr.  PARISH.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Subcommittee  for  inviting  CALSTART  here  today  to  present  our

viewpoint on heavy hybrid technology. We feel like we serve a very
important  role  in  implementing  this  technology  into  the  general
public  and  then  also  providing  a  means  to  focus  the  activity  and
the interest of the different fleets in producing these types of tech-
nologies for use in the fleet activities.

I  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  to  my  presentation  charts
that  are  on  the  screen.  The  CALSTART  activity  is  based,  it  is  a
non-profit  organization,  a  consortium  of  not  only  industry  but  also
fleet  providers,  that  is  very  interested  in  improving  the  industry,
the  transportation  industry,  and  moving  it  forward  in  terms  of  de-
creasing  the  amount  of  fuel  used  and  decreasing  the  amount  of
emissions that are produced by the commercial industries.

HTUF,  the  Hybrid  Truck  Users  Forum,  is  actually  a  subset  of
the  CALSTART  activity  and  is  a  user-driven  process  in  which  we
represent  the  fleets  and  try  to  bridge  the  gap  between  the  tech-
nology  development  activity  and  the  actual  commercialization  of
these  vehicles.  HTUF  intends  to  bring  working  groups  together  of
fleets that are quite interested in a variety of different applications.
Our  first  activity  that  we  put  together  was  in  the  utility  bucket
truck activity, which PG&E took part in, and we simulated the dif-
ferent  requirements  from  the  various  fleets  to  identify  a  common
set  of  requirements  that  the  truck  manufacturers  could  then  re-
spond to.

So  what  we  did  was  get  the  hybrid  truck  technology  off  the
ground. There had been some development of heavy hybrids in the
Department  of  Energy  as  well  as  U.S.  Army  National  Automotive
Center,  and  the  Federal  Transit  Administration,  but  there  was  no
real pull from the fleet side to actually get these vehicles into serv-
ice.

So  what  the  Hybrid  Truck  Users  Forum  did  was  aggregate  the
requirements to provide a focal point for the industry to then start
producing  these  vehicles.  We  did  this  in  a  joint  activity  with  U.S.
Army National Automotive Center. They are very supportive of this
particular  activity,  because  the  Army  is  very  interested  in  seeing
the hybrid technology being implemented and being put out on the
street so they can see a reduction in the cost of these vehicles rath-
er  than  footing  the  cost  of  developing  this  type  of  technology  on
their  own.  They  would  like  to  see  it  become  commercially  viable
and  therefore,  more  cost  effective  in  putting  in  the  military  vehi-
cles.

So  we  have  been  very  active  in  terms  of  this  first  particular
working group that we put together. We have looked at other work-
ing  groups  and  are  in  the  process  of  implementing  those  as  well.
You should be aware that hybrid trucks and medium- and heavy-
duty trucks are very different than the light-duty vehicles. We have
seen a great implementation of light-duty vehicles, hybrid vehicles,
in  the  public  sector.  There  is  good  acceptance  there  now,  but  we
feel  like  because  of  that  acceptance  that  the  government  should
now  start  focusing  on  medium-  and  heavy-duty  sectors  to  start
making some real technology improvements and implementation of
these new vehicle concepts.

On  this  timeline  you  see  where  there  is  a  real  range  in  imple-
mentation  of  these  particular  vehicles.  On  the  far  right  we  are  al-
ready  in  early  production  as  identified  by  Mr.  Smith  from  Eaton

Corporation. We are in early production of these bucket truck vehi-
cles  from  International  using  the  Eaton  drive  train,  and  that  is
very  encouraging,  but  these  vehicles  are  still  rather  expensive.
There  are  other  vehicles  that  are  being  implemented  in  terms  of
the refuse vehicles, parcel delivery, also shuttle bus type of vehicles
that are going to be entering early production here in the next few
years,  but  still  the  technology  is  not  there  to  implement  some  of
the  benefits  that  we  see  in  the  light-duty  world.  In  particular,  I
think  it  was  pointed  out  that  light-duty  vehicles  have  the  ability
to shut off their engines when they are at a stop, engine off at idle
capability.  Right  now  we  do  not  have  that  capability  in  medium-
and heavy-duty trucks because we do not have the electrically-driv-
en  accessories  that  are  required.  So  much  development  is  required
in getting that type of technology in place.

So  we  are  seeing  just  the  first  versions  of  these  vehicles  emerg-
ing at this point in time, and much technology development is still
really needed to make these viable.

And  was  as  pointed  out  earlier,  hybrid  technology  is  starting  to
be  incorporated  in  Class  eight  over-the-road  vehicles,  and  are  now
being  looked  at  in  drage  vehicles  for  the  ports,  particularly  ports
of  LA  and  the  ports  of  Long  Beach.  And  these  are  very  promising
types  of  technologies,  but  until  we  get  the  appropriate  support  for
the  technology,  development,  as  well  as  the  implementation  of
these  vehicles,  and  then  some  incentives  to  help  reduce  the  up-
front  costs,  they  will  be  lagging  in  terms  of  their  implementation.
So  as  identified,  the  trucks  are  different  from  passenger  cars,
even  though  the  technology  has  been  well  developed  for  passenger
cars, and we see it starting to emerge, trucks are a different order
of  magnitude  in  terms  of  their  weight,  class,  and  the  scale  of  the
systems that need to be put in place, as well as the durability that
is  required  for  these  vehicles.  So  there  is  a  whole  new  segment  of
development activity that needs to take place here.

We  feel  that  industry  and  the  fleets  could  benefit  from  support
for  ongoing  R&D.  There  was  some  preliminary  R&D  efforts  in-
volved  at  the  Department  of  Energy  under  the  Heavy  Hybrid  Pro-
gram  managed  by  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Lab,  but  that
funding  has  been  reduced  and  is  now  coming  to  a  close.  And  but
without  the  full  benefit  of  coming  to  fruition  for  these  new  tech-
nologies. So we would like to see some further support for that type
of R&D effort.

And we would also like to see that there be some purchase incen-
tives.  As  was  also  pointed  out  the  initial  costs  of  these  vehicles  is
fairly  high.  The  cost  of  the  fuel  at  this  point  in  time,  even  though
it is high, does not quite cover the total cost of the differential cost
of  the  hybrid  vehicle.  So  what  we  are  seeing  is  some  additional
funding needed up-front to help cover that differential.

So  we  would  also  like  to  see  a  commitment  by  the  government
over  a  long-term,  five-  to  ten-year  program,  to  really  implement
these  technologies,  not  only  hybridization,  but  also  more  efficient
truck technologies into the commercial fleets.

I  would  like  to  thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  talk

with you today and hopefully we have a good discussion.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD C. PARISH

CALSTART thanks the House Committee on Science and Technology, Energy and
Environment  Subcommittee  and  its  members  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  and
share  our  knowledge  with  you  on  the  important  issue  of  hybrid  and  more  efficient
medium-  and  heavy-duty  vehicles.  This  is  a  critical  area  of  emerging  capability  for
the  U.S.,  both  in  terms  of  reducing  fuel—and  cutting  costs—for  users,  as  well  as
reducing urban pollution and global warming emissions. It is also an important com-
petitive leadership issue for U.S. manufacturers building leading-edge products here
and for export to the international market.

CALSTART  and  its  Hybrid  Truck  Users  Forum  (HTUF),  together  with  its  indus-
try,  fleet  and  public  partners,  are  working  together  to  speed  hybrid  and  advanced
truck  commercialization  and  have  identified  the  key  benefits  and  barriers  to
progress which we welcome the chance to explain. We think there is an opportunity
for smart, targeted investments and partnerships between industry and government
to speed these new capabilities to market.

Our  testimony  will  follow  this  outline:  A  brief  introduction  to  CALSTART;  the
Role & Goals of HTUF; the Importance of Hybrids; the State of the Industry; Gaps
and Barriers; Next Steps; Future Vision.

What is CALSTART?

CALSTART is North America’s leading advanced transportation technologies con-
sortium. It is a fuel and technology neutral, participant-supported non-profit organi-
zation  of  more  than  150  companies  and  agencies,  dedicated  to  expanding  and  sup-
porting a high-tech transportation industry that cleans the air, creates economic op-
portunity and reduces imported oil use and greenhouse gas emissions.

CALSTART  serves  as  an  unbiased,  strategic  broker  to  spur  advanced  transpor-
tation  technologies,  fuels,  systems  and  the  companies  that  make  them.  It  works
across four areas to expand and support this industry: operating technology develop-
ment and demonstration programs with industry partners; consulting to ports, fleets
and  others  on  implementation  of  new  fuels,  vehicles  and  technologies;  providing
services to industry members to expand their capabilities; and supporting and guid-
ing  the  creation  of  policies  that  increase  the  efficiency  and  reduce  the  emissions  of
U.S. transportation.

CALSTART  plays  a  leading  national  role  in  facilitating  the  development  of  ad-
vanced propulsion systems and alternative fuels in the heavy-duty vehicle and tran-
sit  industry.  It  helped  create  the  capability  for  heavy-duty  hybrid  drive  systems  in
transit  buses  in  program  partnerships  with  DARPA,  and  now  leads  efforts  in  ad-
vanced  commercial  vehicle  hybrids,  fuels  cells,  hydrogen  and  biofuels.  Founded  in
1992,  CALSTART  is  headquartered  in  California  but  operates  nationally  and  inter-
nationally in its programs.

Role and Goals of the Hybrid Truck Users Forum (HTUF)

The  Hybrid  Truck  Users  Forum  (HTUF)  is  a  national  program  made  up  of  first-
mover fleets and major truck and system makers to speed the commercialization of
medium-  and  heavy-duty  hybrid  vehicles  and  to  build  a  competitive,  sustainable
medium-  and  heavy-duty  hybrid  vehicle  market.  HTUF  is  operated  by  CALSTART
in  a  unique  partnership  with  the  U.S.  Army  Tank-Automotive  Research,  Develop-
ment and Engineering Center (TARDEC)—National Automotive Center (NAC).1 Ad-
ditional  program  support  has  been  provided  by  the  Hewlett  Foundation,  with  some
project  funding  from  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  the  Department  of  En-
ergy. HTUF has proven to be a highly successful program to jump-start the commer-
cial hybrid truck industry in North America. Its track record of success, and the re-
sults  in  terms  of  industry  development  and  product  launches,  has  benefited  truck
makers  and  suppliers  as  well  as  military  planners  keen  on  supporting  a  dual-use
commercial  manufacturing  capability  for  advanced  trucks.  HTUF  is  credited  with
removing one to two years from the product development cycle.

HTUF  was  designed  to  fill  what  was  clearly  a  gap  between  technology  develop-
ment  and  products  moving  into  the  market.  What  was  needed  was  a  nimble,  fast-
track process for commercialization. HTUF’s model for action focuses on truck users
to create market ‘‘pull’’ (demand) around their needs for saving fuel, reducing emis-
sions  and  noise  and  better  performance.  HTUF  now  works  with  more  than  80  na-
tional fleets representing more than one million vehicles on the road, and all major

1 The  NAC  is  the  Army’s  outreach  arm  to  the  commercial  transportation  industry,  and  is
charged  with  both  understanding  the  capabilities  of  the  commercial  vehicle  industry  and  work-
ing to increase the capabilities of the industry to build advanced vehicles and technologies that
can support emerging Army and military needs.

truck  makers  and  system  suppliers.  HTUF  has  identified  the  most  promising  early
uses  of  hybrid  technology  (such  as  refuse,  delivery  and  utility  trucks),  is  working
with  fleet  users  of  these  vehicles  to  determine  their  common  needs,  and  then  is  or-
ganizing these committed users to purchase and use commercially-built hybrids that
meet  these  requirements.  For  the  commercial  industry,  this  has  significantly  accel-
erated  their  time  to  market  by  allowing  them  to  focus  on  the  most  promising  first
markets.  Product  improvement  is  also  much  faster  because  customers  share  infor-
mation  and  needs  in  real  time  with  suppliers  during  assessment  and  development.
There  is  an  additional  benefit  in  the  model—reducing  cost  and  time  for  the  mili-
tary user. By developing a commercial manufacturing base and market for similarly
sized  and  functioning  systems,  eventual  costs  to  military  users  are  reduced.  The
time to source and deploy future military systems is reduced, as well. By partnering
in early commercial deployments, the military is able to assess performance, designs
and  architecture  at  extremely  low  cost.  And  by  being  active  in  the  performance  re-
quirements,  future  military  capabilities,  such  as  silent  watch,  are  designed  into
commercial systems from the start.

HTUF fleets have already launched or completed several fast track projects. Four-
teen  initial  fleets  ordered,  deployed  and  assessed  24  utility  hybrid  trucks  in  a  na-
tional  pilot  program,  demonstrating  up  to  50  percent  fuel  economy  improvements
and exceptional reliability. This effort led directly to a follow up order of more than
100  trucks  and  has  now  helped  launch  early  hybrid  production  in  this  class  of  me-
dium-duty  trucks.  HTUF  fleet  working  groups  in  the  parcel,  refuse  and  small  bus
categories  are  launching  similar  pilot  efforts  to  spread  hybrid  truck  applications.  A
new working group—in full-size, Class 8 long haul trucks, plans to deploy some hy-
brid ‘‘big-rigs’’ by late 2008. As a result of the HTUF process, the commercial indus-
try  is  now  rapidly  developing  early  heavy-duty  hybrid  products  in  several  different
market applications. First assembly line production has now started and additional
product launches are pending.

Importance of Hybrids

Hybrid technology is a transformative technology for transportation. Future vehi-
cles need to reduce urban pollution while also cutting fuel use. Few technologies can
do  both:  hybrid  can,  increasing  efficiency  while  also  reducing  emissions.  Not  only
can  it  provide  immediate  benefits  today,  in  terms  of  reduced  fuel  consumption,  re-
duced  criteria  emissions  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  it  also  is  an  ena-

use of electrified, more efficient components, the use of downsized and optimized en-
gines and combustion schemes, and enabling a transition to greater engine-off oper-
ation  with  enhanced  energy  storage.  The  stored  energy  can  come  from  cleaner  fuel
sources—such  as  electricity—in  plug-in  variants.  For  the  military,  hybrids  provide
not just reduced consumption—which means a reduced supply chain and longer en-
durance—but  also  advanced  capabilities.  Military  vehicles  desperately  need  in-
creased  electrical  power  in  deployed  vehicles,  and  military  users  desire  greater
power generation in the field: both are inherent capabilities of a hybrid electric sys-
tem. Military planners also seek engine-off ‘‘silent watch’’ functionality, which is the
ability to support vehicle functions from stored energy without using the noisy—and
detectable—engine.  Hybrids  deployed  in  assessment  by  HTUF  and  the  NAC  have
already proven-out this stealth function. Advanced versions can allow ‘‘stealth’’ driv-
ing, as well—vehicle movement for limited distances without the engine starting.

State of the Industry

Hybrid truck technology has made significant strides in the last several years and
is  now  on  the  ‘‘cusp’’  of  commercialization.  However,  unlike  passenger  cars,  where
hybrid  technology  has  been  in  production  for  a  decade,  first  hybrid  production  is
only  now  just  starting  in  the  truck  industry.  Integrating  hybrid  technology  into
truck  platforms  presents  different  challenges  than  in  passenger  cars,  requiring  dif-
ferent  strategies,  packaging  and  weight  concerns,  system  designs  and  component
sizing.  The  market  drivers  and  purchase  criteria  are  completely  different  in  the
commercial  vehicle  market  than  in  the  consumer  market.  Therefore,  it  is  fair  to
think of hybrid trucks as being ten years behind the auto industry and also needing
very  different  research,  development  and  market  acceptance  tools  to  support  them.

So  far,  unlike  the  automotive  industry,  the  leaders  in  medium-  and  heavy-duty
hybrids are U.S.-based manufacturers. This is a significant advantage to the Nation.
However,  that  leadership  is  not  assured.  More  than  six  truck  makers  and  ten  sys-
tem makers are now developing heavy hybrid prototypes or pre-production products
in  first  applications,  but  the  effort  has  not  yet  achieved  critical  mass  and  is  at  an
important  point  in  its  evolution.  To  break  out,  these  first  efforts  must  succeed  and
expand. One of the key early barriers to success is that production volumes are low,
so prices remain high.

On  target  with  HTUF’s  intermediate  goals,  the  first  U.S.  truck  maker  entered
early assembly line production of hybrids in October 2007. International Truck and
Engine  Corporation,  using  an  Eaton  Corporation  hybrid  electric  drive  system,
launched  the  DuraStar  hybrid  truck.  It  is  now  available  in  limited  quantities  from
all its dealers in North America. The company can build up to one thousand trucks
its  first  year.  This  capability  was  assisted  directly  from  HTUF’s  efforts.  Two  other
truck  makers,  Peterbilt  and  Kenworth,  have  announced  early  production  plans  for
2008,  including  hydraulic  and  electric  hybrid  offerings  using  Eaton  systems,  and
Peterbilt  is  developing  a  Class  8  long-haul  hybrid  truck.  Azure  Dynamics  will  start
producing  a  hybrid  chassis  with  Ford  in  2008.  Freightliner  has  recently  announced
it will join International, Kenworth and Peterbilt in the medium hybrid truck mar-
ket.  Volvo/Mack  has  announced  a  hybrid  truck  capability  in  the  2009/2010  time-
frame.  Other  companies  are  show-casing  capabilities  and  prototypes,  including
Dueco  with  an  Odyne  plug-in  hybrid  utility  truck,  Oshkosh  with  an  electric  refuse
collection  truck,  Crane  Carrier  with  both  an  electric  hybrid  featuring  an  ISE
driveline and a hydraulic hybrid featuring a Bosch Rexroth driveline. BAE, Allison,
Parker  Hannifin,  Hybra-Drive,  Permo-Drive,  Enova  Systems  and  ArvinMeritor  are
other  examples  of  suppliers  with  active  development  efforts,  some  of  which  already
produce hybrid systems for transit or other applications.

Initially  there  was  skepticism  by  some  whether  hybrid  technology  would  have  a
broad enough application to all trucks. Certainly initially, it is clear there are some
first  ‘‘beachhead’’  markets  and  applications  for  hybrids,  such  as  refuse,  urban  and
regional  delivery,  utility  and  similar  work  truck  applications.  However,  these  early
markets  are  just  the  beginning,  not  the  end  pint,  for  hybrids.  HTUF  and  partner
testing  are  showing  that  hybrid  technology  delivers  greater  fuel  economy  in  almost
every  duty  cycle.  The  key  early  issue  is  to  place  hybrid  vehicles  where  they  will
have  the  highest  initial  payback.  However,  as  system  costs  come  down  with  in-
creased  volume,  improved  system  design  and  integration  and  new  technologies,  hy-
brid drivelines will steadily be applied in more and more market segments. Indeed,
the next breakthrough in hybrid technology appears to be Class 8 long haul trucks,
the  highest  fuel  using  truck  class.  Five  truck-makers  have  public  or  private  pro-
grams  to  develop  this  capability,  currently  led  by  Peterbilt-Eaton.  Hybrid  systems
may  contribute  three  to  four  percent  fuel  economy  improvements  alone;  combined
with  their  built-in  ability  to  provide  idle  reduction  savings,  this  could  approach  six
to  eight  percent  improvements.  Hybrid  technology  actually  shows  the  future  capa-
bility  of  addressing  a  significant  percentage  of  the  truck  fleet,  building  out  of  first
markets in heavy urban work trucks.

Gaps and Barriers

Hybridizing  the  truck  driveline  is  a  key  stepping-stone  to  future  advanced  capa-
bilities  in  both  hybrid  and  conventional  trucks.  If  we  are  to  reduce  petroleum  use
(and  address  climate  change)  it  is  one  of  the  key  technologies  to  achieve  that.  Yet
truck and system makers need public sector support and partnerships to bring these
important  technologies  forward  as  quickly  as  the  Nation  needs  them.  The  industry
is resource constrained: as much as 80 percent of the engineering talent at the truck
and  engine  makers  has  been  focused,  rightly,  on  the  emission  reduction  require-
ments of 2007 and 2010. To support a parallel and fast-track effort in hybrids, crit-
ical  as  it  is,  is  more  than  the  industry  can  do  alone.  Industry  needs  government
partnership and shared risk and investment to make it happen as fast as it is need-
ed.

The  core  early  barriers  to  fleet  adoption  are  clearly  high  unit  cost  mostly  due  to
low manufacturing volumes and the lack of a robust component marketplace. Assist-
ance  to  help  fleets  cross  this  first  market  incremental  price  barrier  would  be  ex-
tremely  helpful.  However,  fleets  also  need  additional  in-use  performance  data  and
validation to help justify their capital investment in these new systems, and assist-
ance to aggregate their demand with other fleets to speed purchases. Together with
this  is  industry’s  need  for  additional  development  and  testing  of  new  components,
better  system  integration  and  advanced  capabilities.  In  essence,  hybrid  trucks  are
at the emergent stage of technology; the performance shown by early vehicles is just
the beginning of what future hybrid and advanced capabilities can be.

Given  these  observations,  CALSTART/HTUF  has  identified  with  its  industry  and
fleet  partners  the  core  needs  for  continuing  momentum  in  hybrids,  and  they  fall
along the stages of development:

• Need for continued funding of research and development in core hy-

brid and advanced systems (R&D—development stage)

• Need for continued funding and partnership in fleet support/pre-pro-
duction  demonstration  and  pilot  projects  to  assess  and  validate  hy-

brid performance and reliability (Demonstration/Validation—pre-pro-
duction stage)

• Need for fleet purchase assistance in the early market stage to speed
introduction  and  rapidly  increase  manufacturing  volume  (Purchase
Incentives—early market stage).

In  terms  of  R&D,  the  core  technology  development  needs  now  are  for  improved
system  integration  and  manufacturability,  reduced  energy  storage  costs  specific  to
commercial vehicle designs, electrified components (to enable even greater fuel econ-
omy  gains  in  all  trucks,  and  more  capable  hybrids  in  particular),  optimized  and
downsized  engines,  advanced  combustion  schemes,  power  generation,  light-weight
materials, and advanced control systems.

It’s  important  to  understand  that  there  are  still  technical  barriers  for  trucks  and
buses  that  are  not  the  same  for  passenger  cars.  For  instance,  there  is  no  commer-
cially-available  electrically-driven  air  conditioning,  steering  pump  or  other  compo-
nents  yet  in  the  truck  world.  There  are  expensive  prototypes,  but  no  systems  that
can  hold  up  to  heavy-duty  vehicle  duty  cycles.  This  is  a  core  area  of  need,  because
their  availability  not  only  enables  more-effective  hybrids,  they  make  for  more  effi-
cient conventional trucks as well. Optimized engines are another good example. Spe-
cifically  because  a  hybrid  drive  system  allows  the  main  engine  to  work  differently,
and usually to work less or work in a narrower power range, cleaner and more effi-
cient engine designs are possible, such as Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition
(HCCI).  Such  engines  are  more  difficult  to  use  if  they  must  cover  the  full  range  of
a conventional truck’s power needs, but may be possible when functioning in a more
limited power range coupled to a hybrid system.

The  medium-  and  heavy-duty  industry  would  greatly  benefit  from  support  across
all  three  of  the  stages  identified  above  to  more  rapidly  improve  the  fuel  efficiency
of the heavy truck sector, which has the highest per vehicle fuel use, and therefore
the highest pay-back potential for investment. Yet investment has been sorely lack-
ing for the commercial vehicle platforms, or applied in a less than focused way.

It  is  worth  noting  that  Department  of  Energy  projects  to  help  develop  and  test
early  heavy  hybrid  technologies,  managed  by  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Lab
(NREL), were very useful and moved specific technologies forward that are in prod-
ucts  we  are  now  seeing  today  in  transit  hybrid  buses  and  medium  hybrid  trucks.
Unfortunately, most of that funding and commitment has ended.

Similarly,  significant  progress  was  made  to  drive  the  core  hybrid  driveline
functionality  via  early  Department  of  Transportation–Federal  Transit  Administra-
tion  and  Defense  Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA)  funding  in  the
1990s. These were exceptionally innovative programs.

Missing  from  all  these  efforts  was  not  only  a  longer-term  duration,  but  support

and strategies that moved technology along all the stages of development.

The commercial vehicle segment has not been a high enough priority for funding.
It  has  also  been  assumed  that  investments  made  in  passenger  cars  are  sufficient
to  support  commercial  vehicle  needs.  The  truth  is,  there  are  important  differences
between commercial and consumer—truck and car—hybrid vehicles in terms of duty
cycles, system architectures, market needs and business cases. A portfolio of smart,
targeted  funding  over  a  multi-year  period  and  covering  all  the  stages  identified
above and aimed at the needs of the commercial industry would have significant im-
pacts.

The  Army  has  been  a  great  partner  and  leader,  supports  this  effort  and  has  di-
rected  internal  funds  to  it,  but  resources  to  completely  support  the  needs  and  de-
velop  new  capabilities  are  limited  by  the  Army’s  immediate  priorities.  Additional
broader  support  is  needed  to  accelerate  the  effort  and  achieve  critical  next  steps  to
develop a national heavy hybrid capability.

Next Steps

HTUF  itself,  together  with  its  partners,  are  currently  focused  on  a  multi-year
strategy that envisions creating a sustainable hybrid and high efficiency truck mar-
ket  over  the  next  seven  years,  and  working  to  develop  the  support  to  achieve  this
vision.  Hybrids  are  the  first  and  critical  component  of  the  move  to  high  efficiency
trucks.  To  achieve  this  will  require  building  both  market  volumes  in  early  applica-
tions,  and  adding  new  capabilities  to  both  hybrid  and  conventional  trucks  over  this
time  frame.  To  do  this  effectively  will  require  government  partnerships  and  risk
sharing with the industry and fleets.

To  succeed  will  require  a  robust,  self-sustaining  hybrid  truck  market,  with  offer-
ings  across  multiple  platform  sizes  and  applications.  To  achieve  these  goals  HTUF
needs to continue to recruit and educate fleets in the targeted segments, and ensure
that  pre-production  and  early  production  commitments  are  achieved  in  these  seg-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:29 Dec 08, 2008 Jkt 042802 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E08\061008\42802 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

43

ments  over  the  next  several  years.  This  will  also  entail  opening  new  segments  as
price points allow, such as industrial/non-road vehicles and drayage trucks.

Hybrid  alone  will  provide  such  benefits  in  many  but  not  all  duty  cycles.  It  will
require  enhanced  capabilities  to  achieve  these  levels,  including  optimized  engines,
improved energy storage, light-weight material use, more efficient components, bet-
ter aerodynamics in long haul applications, plug-in hybrid modes, and other strate-
gies.  Such  enhancements  enable  the  increased  capabilities  of  quiet,  engine-off  oper-
ation  and  the  ability  of  some  trucks  to  be  mobile  power  generators  for  emergency
and work needs.

Importantly,  these  same  improvements  that  increase  the  capabilities  of  hybrids
also increase the fuel efficiency of conventional trucks. This concurrent move of hy-
brids  into  Class  8  heavy  segments  and  the  focus  on  improving  core  truck  compo-
nents is the leverage point to much more broadly impact the truck industry. By tar-
geting  users  demanding  increased  fuel  efficiency,  working  with  regulatory  agencies
to develop accepted metrics for hybrid fuel efficiency and expanding the suite of ena-
bling  and  enhancing  technologies  for  hybrids,  we  will  provide  the  platform  and  the
pathway  for  measuring,  delivering  and  expanding  improved  fuel  efficiency  in  all
trucks.

Future Vision

The  government  has  a  rightful  and  needed  role  to  play  at  each  stage  of  hybrid
and  high  efficiency  truck  and  technology  development,  and  it  is  likely  a  different
role  at  each  point.  If  government  agencies  were  to  commit  to  moving  forward
medium-  and  heavy-duty  hybrid  and  high  efficiency  trucks  following  an  integrated
plan  and  an  ‘‘investment’’  strategy  for  the  use  of  funding,  that  would  be  extremely
useful and cost-effective for the industry.

In  light  of  the  growing  market  penetration  and  public  acceptance  of  hybrid
drivetrain  technology  in  light-duty  vehicles,  the  government  can  now  direct  a  con-
certed  focus  on  the  medium-  and  heavy-duty  sectors  to  further  advance  the  tech-
nology benefits.

It is important to note that assistance is needed now. The industry is at a critical
stage  and  on  the  threshold  of  a  successful  launch.  However,  this  launch  can  also
be viewed more broadly as the first stage of a transformation of transportation tech-
nology. What is required is a commitment to a major program, on a par with light-
duty  efforts,  to  move  medium-  and  heavy-duty  vehicle  technology  to  the  next  level.
Therefore, looking forward in the broadest sense, CALSTART could envision a high
profile program built on these parameters:

44

• First, a commitment to target, support and fund over a multi-year period the
steps required to achieve commercialization outlined earlier: R&D; Fleet Sup-
port and Pre-production Demonstration; and Purchase Incentives. To get max-
imum effect, an integrated strategy encompassing all three is needed.

• Second, government’s role and risk should be different at each stage, as is ac-
knowledged  already  in  most  programs.  However,  a  portfolio  approach  as  to
how much funding to apply to each stage, and a commitment to do so consist-
ently  over  several  years,  would  be  most  beneficial  to  the  market.  It  would
focus industry technology investments and engineering resource allocation as
well as signal to private investors where to extend their investment into inno-
vation in new technology. Such signals can often leverage as much private re-
source as direct governmental funding.

Æ Research and development might rightly make up 15–20 percent of such
a total government partnership portfolio, with pre-production demonstra-
tion, testing and validation an additional five to ten percent. We can see
the  need  for  purchase  incentives,  based  on  a  sliding  scale  determined  by
truck size and level of increased efficiency, and declining over time, mak-
ing up as much as 70–75 percent of this overall portfolio.

• Third,  it  is  highly  important  that  research,  development  and  demonstration
activities  be  designed  and  operated  to  encourage  competition,  innovation  and
new  players.  Past  efforts  in  some  agencies  have  been  closed  to  any  but  a
handful  of  manufacturers  and  suppliers,  a  constraint  unlikely  to  speed  new
approaches. Additionally, a commitment to spur action and achieve aggressive
outcomes would add energy to the program. We can envision a ten year com-
mitment  to  achieve  40–50  percent  fuel  economy  gains  as  an  average  across
all new trucks as a starting point for discussion.

• Fourth,  such  a  program  structure  would  ideally  take  place  over  a  minimum
of  five  years  and  be  led  by  an  agency  or  partnership  that  sees  the  value  of
and  desires  action  to  occur.  Given  the  likely  growing  concerns  with  reducing
foreign  oil  imports  for  energy  security,  the  need  for  greater  fuel  efficiency  to
save truck operators money and secure jobs, and the need for significant car-
bon  reductions  in  the  future,  a  ten  year  program  would  be  ideal  as  a  clarion
call to and a signal of commitment and action.

• Fifth, the level of investment should be commensurate with the needs and the
challenge.  California  has  recently  enacted  a  high  tech  and  fuel  investment
program (Assembly Bill 118) that will invest $200M per year over seven years
in  new  transportation  technology  and  fuels.  Given  this  precedent  in  only  one
state, we would recommend at least a comparable federal effort, but targeting
hybrid  and  high-efficiency  medium-  and  heavy-duty  vehicles  over  ten  years.
This can serve as a framework for the effort needed to ensure U.S. manufac-
turing technology leadership and meeting its energy security and greenhouse
gas  emissions  goals.  Based  on  the  investment  portfolio  proposed,  this  could
mean  $40–$60M  per  year  for  R&D  and  fleet  support/pre-production  deploy-
ments, and $140M per year for purchase incentives. This balance can also be
modified  to  ‘‘front  load’’  the  investment  in  the  early  years  and  decline  over
time,  from  $400M/year  down  to  $50M  in  the  final  year.  Purchase  incentives
can also be structured to decline over time.

Such  program  commitments  and  integrated  strategies  are  difficult  to  coordinate
across  different  agencies,  as  demonstrated  by  the  limited  success  of  some  previous
efforts.  However,  it  is  possible  that  motivated  agencies  can  be  determined  to  carry
out  segments  of  the  total  strategy.  The  Department  of  Transportation  already  has
responsibility for setting truck fuel economy standards; its Federal Transit Adminis-
tration has helped spur hybrid bus acceptance; the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy  is  establishing  truck  fuel  economy  testing  protocols;  the  Department  of  Energy’s
NREL  has  managed  R&D  and  testing  for  heavy  hybrids;  The  Department  of  De-
fense’s  NAC  has  invested  in  both  targeted  hybrid  R&D  and  in  pre-production  pilot
demonstrations.  A  coordinated  approach  is  critical,  as  is  a  strong  and  willing  com-
mitment to lead. The DOD’s NAC is a good example of an agency taking a focused,
outcome-oriented  approach  and  achieving  measurable  results.  Such  characteristics
have been the hallmark of past successful efforts in which we have experience.

Again, thanks to the Committee, staff and Members for the opportunity to provide
this testimony and share the progress to date we have seen in medium- and heavy-
duty hybrids, and the significant benefit we could create for our industry and nation
with a focused and strategic commitment to move change in this field.

DISCUSSION

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S ROLE IN PROMOTING HEAVY

HYBRID TECHNOLOGIES

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Parish.
At  this  point  we  will  open  our  first  round  of  questions,  and  the

Chair will recognize himself for five minutes.

Mr. Penney, let me ask of you, what, at what point in the devel-
opment  do  you  feel  that  it  is  appropriate  for  DOE  involvement  to

begin  to  drop  off?  And  secondly,  should  we  focus  only  on  the  most
basic  research,  or  do  we  have  a  responsibility  to  see  that  tech-
nologies get to the market, and where are they weakest?

Mr.  PENNEY.  That  is  a  good  question.  The  opportunity  from  my
perspective  I  enjoy  seeing  systems  level  approach.  When  we  work
on  components,  which  is  essential  and  required,  you  sometimes
don’t,  when  you  put  all  the  pieces  together,  you  learn  new  things,
and I tried to emphasize in my testimony that a systems approach
is absolutely critical.

Now,  the  Department  of  Energy  has  classically  funded  on  the
component level for energy storage, power electronics, thermal con-
trols,  and  issues  like  that.  They  have  drawn  the  line  because  they
feel  that  industry’s  responsibility  is  to  put  that  system  level  to-
gether.  As  was  pointed  out  by  Mr.  Parish,  we  did  have  a  few
projects  with  Oshkosh  truck,  with  Eaton,  and  Allison  Bus  transit
fleets.  The  system  level  performance  really  taught  us  new  things
that we didn’t learn from just component-type activities. And all of
these  companies  benefited  greatly  by  that  education,  and  they
would  not  be  there  today  had  it  not  been  for  that  federal  support.

PRICING

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Smith,  what  is  the  price
premium  for  an  Eaton  hybrid  truck  compared  to  a  conventional
model, and what accounts for the difference?

Mr.  SMITH.  Well,  the  difference  is  accounted  for  because  of  the
added componentry that we need to add. There is, in a parallel sys-
tem  like  we  provide,  there  is  a  motor  generator  that  is  in  the  sys-
tem,  there  is  a  power  electronics  inverter  that  takes  energy  from
the  batteries  and  feeds  it  to  the  motor  or  in  the  condition  where
you are acting as a generator such as regenerative braking, you are
taking  power  back  from  the  generator  and  feeding  it  into  the  bat-
teries to recharge.

So  the  price  premium  that  you  are  paying  is  for  all  of  the  addi-
tional  components,  plus  all  of  the  controls  that  make  all  of  these
individual  components  work  together,  you  know,  efficiently  and
safely.

As  far  as  the  price  premium,  that  is  actually  an  OEM  decision
to the customer since we sell to OEMs and then the OEMs sell di-
rectly  to  the  customers,  but  as  Ms.  Egbert  mentioned,  you  know,
the  50  percent  premium  currently  on  a  hybrid  vehicle  is  probably
very close to what we are seeing out in the market today for a hy-
brid vehicle.

THE 21ST CENTURY TRUCK PARTNERSHIP

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Has  the  21st  Century  Truck  Partnership
been  a  success?  And  should  it  continue?  And  I  would  like  for  all
of you to comment on that, and add a second part to it. How could
the program be structured better to speed hybrid technology in me-
dium and heavy truck, heavy-duty trucks?

And do you want to start, Mr. Smith?
Mr.  SMITH.  Yeah.  It  is  actually  not  a  topic  that  I  am  well  in-
formed  on,  and  I  can  respond  in  writing  at  a  later  date  to  give  a
full response from the Eaton perspective.

things?

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Anyone  want  to  comment  on  those  two

Please, Mr. Parish.
Mr. PARISH. Yes. I think the 21st Century Truck Program ideally
was very well conceived, and I think it started out with good prom-
ise,  because  we  did  have  the  involvement  of  a  variety  of  different
federal agencies in that particular activity, and it looked like it was
going to be very constructive.

However, as it turned out, I think it had limited success, because
there  was  a  lack  of  a  real  vision  and  adequate  funding  for  the  ac-
tivity.  I  think  as  we  have  observed  the  21  CT  activity  now  is  kind
of  a  gathering  of  interested  parties  that,  you  know,  they  are  inter-
ested  to  see  if  anything  is  going  to  happen  from  the  federal  level,
but  from  what  we  have  seen  so  far  nothing  has  really  been  initi-
ated,  and  there  has  been  no  real  program  activity  that  resulted  as
a result of the 21 CT Program.

So I would say that, yes, as it is conceived it is a very viable and
very  worthwhile  type  of  activity,  but  I  think  it  needs  to  be  re-
visioned  in  terms  of  how  it  is  led  and  make  sure  that  there  is  an
agency  that  is  very  motivated  to  make  it  a  success.  And  our  asso-
ciation with U.S. National Automotive Center has proven that they
have the ability to——

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Penney, do you want to comment?
Mr. PENNEY. Yes. I am NREL’s lab rep for 21 CT. In fact, I can-
celed my trip today, they are having a 21 CT meeting at Volvo Cor-
poration  in  Greensboro,  and  I  think  the  issue  as  was  pointed  out,
there  needs  to  be  a  flagship  project,  and  I  think  getting  together
and  sharing  the  education  that  I  talked  about  in  the  21  Century
Truck Partnership has been very useful. We generally have at least
monthly phone calls, people share what is happening, what is new,
what are the issues that need to be worked on, but as Richard had
pointed  out,  the  funding  from  DOE  has  been  focused  more  on  the
light  duty  because  of  the  displacement  of  oil  savings  on  the  large
number  of  light-duty  vehicles  as  opposed  to  the  heavy-duty  vehi-
cles.

But I think we have talked in the 21 Century Truck Partnership
with  all  the  members  of  a  flagship  project  such  as  a  super  truck,
putting  all  these  technologies  together,  aerodynamics,  idle  reduc-
tion,  hybridization,  start,  stop,  you  know,  these  things  as  one  big
package  it  would  be  nice  to  have  a  moon  shot  for  a  truck,  so  to
speak,  especially  on  the  Class  eight  applications,  which,  in  fact,
could save a lot of oil.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  I  yield  to  Mr.  Inglis  for  five

minutes.

SCIENTIFIC AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO DEPLOYMENT

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First of all, Mr. Smith, thank you for having, Eaton having a fa-
cility in Greenville, South Carolina. We are very happy to have you
there, and I will give you an opportunity to give a plug if you want
to  about  what  you  do  there,  especially  if  it  relates  to  this  or  even
if  it  doesn’t.  But  figure  out  a  way  to  work  that  into  an  answer,
would you? Do an advertisement for Greenville, South Carolina.

So  I  am  sort  of  wondering  here  whether  we  are  doing  science  or
economics.  If  it  is  science  that  is  holding  us  back  through  the  de-
ployment of these technologies or if it is economics. The issue with
economics  is  you  can  approach  it  a  couple  of  different  ways.  One
is you can do grants and tax credits and regulate things, or you can
unleash  the  power  of  the  market.  If  you  unleash  the  power  of  the
market,  it  seems  to  me  the  first  step  is  to  stop  having  free
externalities associated with incumbent technology, which is diesel.
If  you  attach  the  price  to  that,  you  internalize  the  externals  to
that product, then that 50 percent premium becomes a much small-
er  premium.  Right?  Because  then  the  freebie  in  the  air  that  cur-
rently  is,  benefits  the  incumbent  technology,  which  is  diesel,
shrinks.  And  as  it  shrinks  hybrids  and  every  other  kind  of  alter-
native  suddenly  becomes  economically  viable.  Maybe  not  so  sud-
denly but it becomes economically viable.

So which are we talking about here? Are we talking science that
is  holding  us  back,  or  are  we  talking  economics  that  is  holding  us
back?

Anybody want to tackle that?
Mr. DALUM. In my opinion it is both. I think there are some very
short-term  benefits  that  could  be  gained  in  this  area,  in  my  view,
in  plug-in  technology,  but  those  benefits  are  somewhat  limited  by
not performing enough research. The research in my view could im-
prove the performance over what is available today. I am referring
to  different  powertrain  designs  which  use  smaller  engines,  larger
electric  motors,  different  battery  technology  that  I  have  not  seen
available in a large capacity advanced battery for a truck.

So  I  think  it  is  a  little  bit  of  both.  I  think  we  could  move  very
quickly if we had some research for specific applications and incen-
tives,  and  then  secondly,  perhaps  some  research  devoted  to  more
longer-term advancement of the technology.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  what  you  are  selling  today,  is  the  electricity
used to charge the battery which then runs the powertrain or is it
like the Chevy Volt is going to do? That is the concept of the Volt.
Right?

Mr.  DALUM.  It  is  a  parallel  system,  which  means  that  the  diesel
engine is always operating when the vehicle is moving, and that is
because as Mr. Parish had talked about, in the industry right now
there is not a commercially-available, high-volume, electrification of
certain  subcomponents  like  the  HVAC  system,  power  steering,
brakes, and so forth.

So the engine is always running, and the electric motor provides
supplemental propulsion. Okay? So there are limits to its efficiency
gains  because  the  engine  is  always  running.  The  battery  that  we
use  is  a  very  large  battery.  It  is  a  heavy  battery,  but  it  has  been
around  for  a  long  time,  and  that  is  why  we  chose  it,  because  it  is
well  understood  technology.  But  it  depletes.  That  means  that  you
charge  it  up  at  night,  and  you  want  the  battery  to  deplete,  and
then  when  you  are  done  after  the  day,  you  charge  it  up  at  night.
That being said, this vehicle never, you never have to charge the
vehicle  up,  because  the  system  will  monitor  the  state  of  charge  of
the battery, and the engine will turn on if it has to, but we try to,
you  know,  reduce  that  so  that  you  can  use  grid  power  to  recharge
the battery.

Mr. INGLIS. Right.
Mr.  DALUM.  I  hope  that  answers  your  question.  It  is  using  both

diesel and the battery system to provide propulsion.

Mr. INGLIS. Is there an advantage to going to a system that uses

only electricity for propulsion?

Mr. DALUM. In my view there is in certain areas, and I am talk-
ing  more  about  stop  and  go  driving  in  urban  areas.  And  perhaps
in  what  I  would  call  mission  that  has  a,  or  a  job  that  has  a  short
duration  travel  to  a  job  destination,  that  might  be  able  to  be  per-
formed  under  100  percent  electric  operation  for  a  limited  range.
And  then  when  you  are  at  the  job  site,  operate  off  the  battery
power,  and  then  return  to  the  garage  after  the  work  is  completed
and charge up overnight using power from the grid.

Right now the battery power that we have is not sufficient really,
though,  for  that  kind  of  application.  I  think  more  research  needs
to be done to provide that kind of power.

Mr. INGLIS. Mr. Smith, that commercial.
Mr.  SMITH.  Yes.  Yes,  sir.  Or  even  an  electrical  group  down  in

your area.

Mr. INGLIS. Good.
Mr. SMITH. But if I could just comment on what Mr. Dalum said.
I think I would agree. It is a little bit of both science and econom-
ics.  You  know,  to  your  question,  you  know,  would  it  be  better  just
to  be  all  electric,  I  think  that  is  a  question,  though,  that  you  can’t
meet all of the needs because of the very wide range of applications
that we are—and clearly a heavy-duty Class eight truck you would
never  be  able  to  get  enough  storage  capacity  on  a  vehicle  to  do
what  it  needs  to  do.  Some  of  these  work  trucks  travel  far  enough
distances in any given day that, again, you couldn’t store it.

But  there  are  pick-up  and  delivery  trucks  like  potentially  a  Fed
Ex,  a  UPS  truck,  depending  on  their  duty  cycle  and  where  they
run, you might be able to get into a situation where you could run
that  way.  But  the,  you  know,  the  hybrid  and  having  the  ability  to
regen  and  recharge  batteries  on  the  vehicle  I  think  will  always  be
a significant portion of the market, and you will need that.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Smith.  I  am  sure  the
Greenville Chamber of Commerce will be most appreciative of your
comments.

I now recognize Mr. McNerney for five minutes.

BATTERY TECHNOLOGY AND DISPOSAL

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  thank  the
panel. It has been a very interesting hearing, and it is an area that
a  tremendous  opportunity  for  our  country.  I  particularly  want  to
thank  Mr.  Parish  for  coming  from  CALSTART.  CALSTART  is
working  very  hard  to  reduce  emissions  in  the  San  Joaquin  Valley,
which  is  one  of  the  worst  air  pollution  regions  in  the  country.  So
thank you, Mr. Parish, and Ms. Egbert for coming from PG&E, my
home  utility  company.  I  think  your  comments  on  reducing  emis-
sions by 50 to 70 percent is very important, and that is something
we need to keep in mind.

Stockton,  which  is  the  largest  city  in  my  district,  has  now  the
highest  gas  prices  in  the  country  surprisingly,  considering  that  it
also  has  the  highest  foreclosure  rates,  and  I  have  seen  or  we  have

seen a lot of hybrid technology on the highways with regard to pri-
vate  vehicles,  but  companies  like  BNSF  are  developing  high-speed
rail,  not  high  speed  but  rail  hybrid  technology.  So  there  is  a  lot
happening, and it is very exciting to see it.

My first question is about the battery technology. There are four
things  that  I  am  concerned  about.  That  is  the  cost  of  the  tech-
nology,  of  course,  the  reliability,  the  life,  and  the  disposal  require-
ments for batteries. Is that something that they recycled?

Could Mr. Smith or Mr. Dalum take that question?
Mr. SMITH. Yeah. I can comment on it. The, you know, the Eaton
system  currently  is  based  on  lithium  ion  batteries,  and  yes,  those
are fully recyclable and can be handled safely in an end-of-life con-
dition.  I  mean,  it  is,  there  are  several  current  sources  in  the  U.S.
where we can take batteries for appropriate disposal.

Mr. MCNERNEY. I spent much of my career in the manufacturing
industry,  and  there  is  a  law  that  the,  every  time  you  double  your
manufacturing  volume,  your  cost  goes  down  maybe  10  percent  or
15 percent. Do you expect that sort of law to apply? In other words,
as  we  go  up  the  manufacturing  volume,  are  we  going  to  see  the
costs  go  down  accordingly?  Or  is  there  some  inherent  cost  barriers
that we are going to be facing with hybrids?

Mr.  SMITH.  I,  we  definitely  believe  that,  that,  you  know,  we  are
currently,  the  price  premium  we  are,  our  customers  are  paying
today  is  driven  mainly  by  volume  issues.  As  we  can  increase  the
volume of the components, we expect significant price decreases. It
is  all  based,  it  is  what  you  said.  As  we  can  drive  up  the  volumes
and  get  into  high  volume,  lower  cost  manufacturing  processes,  the
cost will come out.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Is  the  battery  technology  improving  in  a  way
that  will  be  parallel  with  the  cost  reductions  or  be  contributing  to
the cost reductions?

Mr. SMITH. Yeah. What we see today, and again, Eaton Corpora-
tion  has  chosen  or  chose  very  early  on  to  pursue  lithium  ion  bat-
teries as the appropriate technology for this, for these vehicles, and
there  is  a  lot  of  lithium  ion  batteries  for  hand  tools,  but  they  are
smaller  cells,  lower  energy  capacity.  Those  systems  are  already  in
very  high  volume,  manufacturing  facilities,  but  the  size  that  you
need for vehicles hasn’t made that transition yet. There is not, you
know,  there  is  not  the  market  demand  driving  that  increase  yet,
so  we  are  on  that  road,  but  we  are  not  to  the  point  where  we  can
justify  spending  the  money  that  you  need  into  the  manufacturing
facilities to increase the volume production and then ultimately get
the lower cost.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Mr.  Penney,  do  you  have  comments  on  the  bat-

tery technology?

Mr.  PENNEY.  Absolutely.  I  was  in  Tampa  at  the  International
Battery Conference a couple of weeks ago, and as was said, the cell
size are like C and D size batteries, and even for the GM–Volt that
was  mentioned,  you  know,  you  are  talking  thousands  of  batteries
and thousands of interconnects, and every time you have an inter-
connect, there is that potential for that string or module to go bad.
Furthermore,  as  you  package  more  and  more  batteries  together
for  these  heavy-truck  applications,  you  have  got  to  worry  about

thermal  issues.  Thermal  management  of  batteries  is  something
that we at NREL have focused on, are very important.

And then finally there is the control. The Prius, for example, was
mentioned.  The  state  of  charge  in  the  Prius,  you  only  use  about  a
quarter of that battery because the state of charge swing goes from
about 85 percent to 65 percent or 50 percent. So that is only a third
of  the  capacity.  On  many  of  these  duty  cycles  and  especially  lith-
ium, you can go from 90 to 10, 90 to 10.

And  for  a  refuse  example,  they  cycle  that  battery  a  thousand
times  a  day  or  that  ultra  cap.  A  battery  can  last  maybe  several
thousand  cycles,  several  million  cycles  depending  on  that  state  of
charge swing, the temperature, and actually the life. And the point
is  that  all  of  these  factors  are  unknown,  and  it  is  extremely  dif-
ficult for these manufacturers to take the risk to say that this vehi-
cle  will  last  ‘‘X’’  number  of  miles  and  put  a  warranty  on  it.  That
warranty  cost  and  that  backing  of  that  component  is  a  very,  very
risky business at this point in time.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Penney.  My  time  has  expired.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, sir.
The  gentlelady  from  Illinois,  Ms.  Biggert,  you  are  recognized  for

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HYBRID EFFORTS

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  one  of  those  peo-
ple that was around in the ’70s, sitting in the gas lines with three
little kids in the back, thinking I was never going to get a full tank
of  gas  again.  And  at  that  time  everybody  thought  that,  and  then
suddenly  all  of  this,  the  crisis  ended,  and  we  forgot  about  it.  The
cars went back to being the SUVs and the heavy trucks and every-
thing.

And I don’t think that that is going to happen again. I think that
we  really  see  that  the  world  has  changed  and  that  we  have  got  to
reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas and whatever.

But my concern is that, you know, we waited so long, and we are
still  waiting,  I  think.  We  have  got  the  hybrid  car.  I  have  one,  and
yet  the  hybrid  plug-in  to  me  seems  to  be  something  that  really  is
going  to,  you  know,  I  think  revolutionize  the  industry  of  both  cars
and trucks.

But trying to, you know, get the battery small enough and to last
long  seems  to  be  taking  quite  a  bit  of  time,  and  I  think  that  if  we
are going to have the grid, then we have to have the nuclear power,
which is going to create the electricity rather than some other type
of energy.

My question is then how are, well, maybe start with Mr. Penney,
is NREL working with the Army or other, any other branch of the
military  in  the  development  of  the  hybrid  truck  technologies  in
bringing down the costs of the hybrid trucks?

Mr.  PENNEY.  Probably  the  intersection  is  through,  as  was  men-
tioned,  the  21st  Century  Truck  Partnership.  We  get  most  of  our
funding,  as  you  know,  from  the  Department  of  Energy.  We  get  no
funding from DOD or TACOM.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Is,  there  was  somebody  else  that  mentioned  the

military that—Mr. Parish.

53

Mr.  PARISH.  Yes.  CALSTART  works  with  the  military  and  gets
some funding from the military to operate the Hybrid Truck Users
Forum  Program.  Obviously,  we  do  feel  like  there  does  need  to  be
further  development  in  the  battery  area,  specifically  for  medium-
and heavy-duty trucks. Right now trucks rely on battery packs that
were  predominantly  designed  for  light-duty  vehicles.  Even  some  of
the buses that we see up in the northwest and the Seattle area ac-
tually  have  Prius  battery  packs  on  them.  These  hybrid  electric
buses.

And  so  what  is  really  neat  is  some  specific  design  of  these  bat-
tery  packs  for  the  medium-  and  heavy-duty  operation,  and  then  a
standardization of that battery pack so we can see the costs of the
battery pack come down and be available to a wide variety of man-
ufacturers.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Well,  the  military  has  been  working  on  finding
lighter-weight  material  or  metals  for  reducing  the  weight  of  tanks
and trucks and whatever. Is the industry looking at that also, like
say titanium?

Mr.  PARISH.  Yes.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  one  of  our  participants  in
CALSTART, Alcoa, is very interested in trying to identify new mar-
kets  for  aluminum  in  light-weighting  of  vehicles,  and  I  think  we
are going to start to see that emerge more importantly here as fuel
economy  becomes  more  important  for  medium-  and  heavy-duty
trucks.

Ms. BIGGERT. Will that dramatically reduce the, if we reduce the
weight, then the battery will last longer and would that aid in the
development of the batteries?

Mr.  PARISH.  Well,  it  is  kind  of  an  integrated  problem.  We  have
to  approach  it  from  a  variety  of  different  perspectives  in  order  to
get the total benefit that we are looking for. So reducing weight in
heavy-duty vehicles, as well as increasing the efficiency of the bat-
tery  packs,  increasing  the  efficiency  in  the  electrification  of  the
auxiliary systems is very necessary.

And then appropriate application of hybridization to the duty cy-
cles of the vehicles is very important because it, there is a wide va-
riety  in  the  way  these  vehicles  are  applied,  and  so  you  get  a  wide
variety  of  benefit  from  the  hybrid  system  as  a  result  of  the  duty
cycle  of  these  vehicles.  So  it  is,  there  is  a  broad  spectrum  of  tech-
nologies  that  need  to  be  investigated  in  order  to  be  integrated  ap-
propriately.

And  also,  downsizing  and  optimizing  of  the  engines.  Right  now
hybrid  trucks  typically  use  diesel  engines,  however,  the  fleets  are
now very interested fleets, such as Fed Ex and UPS, are very inter-
ested in seeing gasoline engines.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  How,  you  mentioned  UPS  and  I  might  mention
that  I  do  have  an  International  truck  in  my  district,  and  UPS  has
a big facility not too far from us, since everybody is claiming some-
thing  in  their  state,  but  with  that,  how,  about  how  big  is  a  fleet
of the UPS with the hybrid trucks versus regular trucks?

Does  anybody  know  that  as  we  have  been  talking  about  them?

Well, I will ask them later then.

Mr.  PARISH.  Well,  they  have  just  started  incorporating  hybrid
trucks.  I  believe  they  have  maybe  on  the  order  of  200  hybrid  elec-
tric vehicles at this point in time. UPS is also investigating hydrau-

lic  hybrid  vehicles,  and  one  of  our  working  groups  is  focused  on
bringing  hydraulic  hybrid  vehicles  to  the  parcel  delivery  segment.
So  they  are  just  being  implemented.  They  are  being  tested,  but
they need some improvements to really hit full stride.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you. Mr. Sensenbrenner, you are rec-

ognized for five minutes.

COMPETITIVE GRANTS

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
First of all, I will claim Mr. Dalum as a constituent since every-
body is putting their oar in the water here. And I also was around
when  we  had  the  gasoline  crisis  of  1979,  and  1980.  It  was  kind  of
my baptism of fire as a Member of Congress because they had this
over-complicated allocation system, and since I represented an area
where  the  population  was  growing,  the  allocations  were  not
enough,  and  the  problems  were  more  acute.  And  President  Carter
actually  announced  he  was  having  the  Bureau  of  Engraving  and
Printing  print  up  gas  rationing  coupons.  We  saw  pictures  of  them
in the newspaper. Well, Mr. Carter didn’t make it through the next
election. President Reagan got rid of the allocation system. The gas
lines  ended,  people  were  able  to  have  full  tanks,  the  price  went
down, and I don’t know if they threw the gas rationing coupons in
the trash or not, but we haven’t seen them, and that was about 30
years ago.

Now, that has convinced me that technology is the way to get out
of  the  pickle  that  we  are  in  rather  than  government  regulation  or
taxes  and  more  red  tape  and  more  Congressional  casework  for  our
employees.

Now,  the  bill  that  I  have  circulated  around  here  establishes  five
grants  for  the  development  of  plug-in  hybrid  trucks.  In  your  writ-
ten testimony, Mr. Penney, you state that there is no single hybrid
truck  designer  system  that  will  meet  all  of  our  transportation
needs.  And  I  guess  my  question  I  would  like  to  ask  of  all  five  of
you  in  the  remainder  of  the  five  minutes  that  I  have  is,  are  five
separate grants enough to be able to have a specific technology de-
veloped  so  that  one  of  these  technologies  would  end  up  being  suit-
able for the various types of trucks that are on the road?

And since you brought the issue up, Mr. Penney, you can go first.
Mr.  PENNEY.  Thank  you.  You  know,  if  you  break  down  trucks
into  various  vocations  as  the  class  system  tries  to  do,  as  I  men-
tioned,  each  class,  each  vocation  needs  a  different  duty  cycle,  just
establishing  and  identifying  and  understanding  that  duty  cycle  is
very difficult. And there probably are more, circling more than five.
I  think  we  identified  maybe  a  dozen  vocations  which  you  would
have to focus in on.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Okay. That is asking a little too much, and
the  Sensenbrenner  rule  of  legislation  is  he  who  sticks  snout  in
trough too far runs risk of getting head chopped off. So I guess that
the competitiveness in the five grants is probably necessary.

How about you, Mr. Smith?
Mr. SMITH. Yeah. I guess I would say that, you know, is five the
right  number?  I  guess  I  am  not  sure.  I  think  really  what  we  need
to  look  at  is  identifying  the  most  likely  paths  to  success  or  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:29 Dec 08, 2008 Jkt 042802 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\061008\42802 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

areas  where  we  are  furthest  behind  or  we  have  the  largest  chal-
lenges.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  But  doesn’t  the  competitive  nature  that  is

contained in the bill take care of that?

Mr.  SMITH.  I  guess  I  am  not  sure.  I  need  to  review  it  a  little  bit

further so that I could comment on that.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Competitive grants work very well. Most of
the  scientific  grants  that  the  Federal  Government  hands  out,
whether it is in basic science or biomedical research.

Mr. Dalum.
Mr. DALUM. I think it is an excellent start. The five grants in my
opinion  would  allow  a  variety  of  different  applications  to  be  sub-
mitted,  and  I  am  talking  about  technologies  that  might  be,  as  dis-
cussed here, for delivery trucks, utility trucks. There are other ap-
plications  I  think  that  could  be  submitted  that  could  benefit  from
plug-in  hybrid  technology,  and  those  could  also  be  part  of  that.  So
I think it is a very good start.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Ms. Egbert.
Ms. EGBERT. I would agree. I think it is a very good start as well.
To  start  to  get  some  of  these  technologies  on  the  road  and  putting
them into real world applications I think will bring us a long way.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Parish.
Mr.  PARISH.  Well,  from  CALSTART’s  perspective  I  think  we
would  prefer  to  see  a  more  general  type  of  a  funding  activity  in
looking  at  medium-  and  heavy-duty  hybrids  specifically  or  gen-
erally improving that general technology with plug-ins being a sub-
set of that general technology. So we feel that there is development
work  that  needs  to  be  done,  but  if  we  focus  strictly  on  the  plug-
in aspect, that will just look at a very limited portion of the whole
spectrum of the activity that needs to be approached.

So,  you  know,  our  feeling  is  that  we  would  really  like  to  see

something more generalized than specifically plug-in.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Thank you. My time is expired.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  yield  myself  as  Chairman  five  minutes,
and  I  yield  to  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  for  him  to  continue  his  ques-
tioning if you would like, Mr. Sensenbrenner.

Mr. SENSENBRENNER. No. I am done.

HYBRIDIZING OFF-ROAD WORK EQUIPMENT

Chairman  LAMPSON.  All  done?  Thank  you  very  much.  Then  I
will,  then  let  me  ask  any  of  you  who  would  care  to  or  all  of  you
if  you  want,  are  you  aware  of  work  being  done  to  hybridize  other
sectors  such  as  heavy  off-road  work  equipment,  stationary  power
sources or other applications?

Mr. Parish.
Mr.  PARISH.  Yes.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  CALSTART  has  just  initi-
ated  a  working  group  focused  on  commercial  construction  equip-
ment.  That  is  also  being  sponsored  by  the  U.S.  National  Auto-
motive  Center,  U.S.  Army  National  Automotive  Center,  because
they are very interested in seeing obviously a fuel use by their con-
struction equipment being reduced.

So  what  we  have  done  is  started  some  activity  in  bringing  to-
gether the industry and the manufacturers, as well as the users of
this  off-road  equipment  to  see  if  we  can  stimulate  some  additional

56

activity  in  hybridization.  We  have  already  seen  Volvo  initiate  a
front-end  wheeled  loader  that  is  hybridized,  and  we  expect  other,
particularly  U.S.  manufacturers  start  to  enter  that  as  well.  John
Deere  as  well  as  Caterpillar  have  both  expressed  a  great  interest
in off-road equipment hybridization.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  Port  of  Long  Beach,  I  understand,  has

demonstration hybrid tugboats.

Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.  Yes,  and  they  also  are  hybridizing  the
crane  lifts  for  the  containers.  So  we  see  hybridization  starting  to
enter in a variety of different modes.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  The  primary  thing  that  we  are  going  to
have  to  accomplish  to  facilitate  all  of  that  is  going  to  be  the  bat-
tery.

Mr. PARISH. The battery.
Chairman LAMPSON. The link to the battery.
Mr.  PARISH.  And  the  auxiliary  systems.  You  know,  we  can’t  just
look  at  one  aspect  as  Mr.  Penney  pointed  out.  If  you  look  at  just
one  component  of  the  system,  then  you  may  not  get  the  full  story.
You really need to look at the whole system affects and look at the
variety  of  different  things  that  are  feeding  into  that  system  oper-
ation.  So  it  is  not  only  the  battery  but  it  is  an  optimized  engine
that operates on the hybrid system.

Right now the engines tend to be a little bit too large for the sys-
tems they are actually running, so you have to optimize those a lit-
tle  bit  better,  plus  the  control.  And  then  also  the  electrical  auxil-
iaries. If you could get electrical auxiliary systems or hydraulically
operated auxiliary systems, then that would improve even more the
efficiency gains.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  How  long  away  are  we  from  looking  right
now, and what is it going to take for us for this function of money
that  we  have  to  throw  at  this  to  get  faster  results,  get  our  in-gain
more quickly?

Mr.  PARISH.  Well,  I  think  so.  I  think  the  first  vehicles  we  have
seen  out  there  by  Eaton  and  International,  which  PG&E  is  using
and  a  variety  of  other  utilities  are  using,  have  shown  the  benefit
of the hybridization.

However, in order for the next generation to come out, you know,
we  saw  the  first  generation  of  Priuses  back  in  ’98,  and  then  when
we saw the second generation of Priuses, which really mushroomed
because of the improvements in the design, we expect to see some-
thing similar in the medium- and heavy-duty truck category, where
this  first  iteration  that  has  come  out,  you  know,  that  it  is  a  great
improvement over the conventional vehicle; however, there needs to
be  a  second  iteration,  and  in  order  to  accomplish  that  second
iteration,  there  has  to  be  significant  improvement  in  a  variety  of
different technologies.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  And  industry  is  just  not  willing  or  capable

to do enough of that by themselves without government help?

Mr.  PARISH.  I  think  they  have  seen  a  downturn  in  their  sales
they did last year as a result of the pre-buy for the 2007 emissions
regulations.  They  are  going  to  see  another  big  pre-buy  for  2010
emissions  regulations.  So  right  now  they  are  currently  in  a  very
low  slump.  I  think  this  last  year  they  were  in  a  very  low  slump
in  sales,  and  so  as  a  result  of  that  they  were  probably  unable  to

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:29 Dec 08, 2008 Jkt 042802 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E08\061008\42802 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

57

spend  the  dollars  that  they  wanted  on  research  for  hybridization,
and  now  they  are  also  spending  quite  a  few  dollars  on  getting
ready for the 2010, emissions regulations.

So, you know, that is what we are seeing is they are, rightly they
are  focused  on  trying  to  improve  their  products  for  the  emissions
regulations,  but  because  of  that  they  don’t  have  adequate  funding,
I feel, to do the research necessary to bring hybrids along.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  would  like  to  pursue  that  some  more  but

let me switch.

Just  looking  at  the  extensive  membership  list  of  CALSTART,  it
would  seem  that  the  industry  efforts  are  fairly  well  integrated
when  it  comes  to  new  technologies.  How  integrated  is  the  heavy-
truck industry compared to that for passenger vehicles, and how is
it different?

Mr.  SMITH.  If  I  could  comment,  I  think  there  is  a  fairly  signifi-
cant  difference,  because  if  you  look  at  the  passenger  car  industry,
it  is  mainly  vertically  integrated.  There  is,  you  know,  a  high  level
of oversight, design responsibility, integration responsibility that is
all  maintained  within  the  companies,  the  Fords,  the  Toyotas,  you
know, whoever it is.

In  the  medium-duty,  heavy-duty  market  it  is  quite  a  bit  dif-
ferent,  where  I  think  there  is  a  view  that  they  are  buying  compo-
nents  that  go  on  the  system.  They  are  buying  a  transmission  or  a
hybrid  system  that  needs  to  integrate  within  the  existing  chassis
with as little disruption to the chassis as possible. And I think the
systems  you  see  out  there,  I  know  the  Eaton  system  we  inten-
tionally try to make it as non-obtrusive to the engine and the chas-
sis as possible.

So there is some real challenges there because of the lack of, you
know,  heavy  integration  or  high  level  of  integration  in  the  vehicle.
Mr. DALUM. I would like to add that the vehicles that we are dis-
cussing are really, at least in the case of the utility truck, are built
in multiple stages, and what that means is that an Eaton here may
provide componentry to International, Ford, GM, or another chassis
manufacturer.  That  chassis  is  then  provided  to  another  company.
That  company  buys  that  and  integrates  their  equipment  on  top  of
the chassis and finishes the manufacturing process and then brings
it to market.

So  unlike  some  other  passenger  cars,  you  have  got  various  enti-
ties along the whole development chain here in going to market. So
it is not as integrated as a passenger car.

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Parish.
Mr.  PARISH.  Yes.  One  more  additional  comment.  What  we  found
when we put the International Eaton bucket trucks out, those were
the first hybrid trucks that were really on the road for commercial
use.  We  found  that  there  was  some  discord  between  the  providers
as  was  identified,  International,  Eaton,  and  the  actual  arm  manu-
facturer  in  terms  of  who  was  responsible  for  what  if  there  was  a
problem.

So  unlike  in  a  light-duty  vehicle,  a  Ford  or  a  Chevrolet,  where
they  are  totally  responsible  for  the  vehicle,  then  because  of  the  in-
tegration  issues  with  a  truck,  it  becomes  then  necessary  to  work
out  who  is  responsible  for  the  operation  of  the  different  aspects  of
the vehicle.

58

So  this  is  one  area  where  some,  you  know,  further  development
activity  needs  to  go  on  in  terms  to  make  everybody  comfortable
with the product that they are offering and in terms of establishing
who has ultimate responsibility.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. Inglis, you are recognized for five minutes.

MORE ON SCIENTIFIC AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO

DEPLOYMENT
Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You  know,  when  it  comes  to  basic  science,  grants  seem  to  make
a lot of sense. National Science Foundation, for example, does basic
science,  and  there  are  no  commercialization  opportunities  imme-
diately  apparent  in  a  lot  of  that  basic  science,  and  therefore,  the
government makes it happen by grants.

When it comes to applied technology like we are discussing here,
I  sort  of  break  out  in  hives  at  the  mention  of  grants,  because  that
means  grant  writers  and  grant  readers,  it  means  regulations  and
regulators,  it  means  an  awful  lot  of  productive  energy  being  spent
pursuing just a little tad of money.

It  seems  there  are  some  other  ways  to  get  there  more  quickly.
One  of  them  is  tax  credits,  which  if  you  think  about  it,  is  a  very
efficient  way  to  deliver  a  stimulus  because  then  you  don’t  have
writers and readers and regulators and regulations.

But  I  wonder  really  what  we  are  talking  about  here  is  mostly
getting  to  the  place  where  the  incumbent  technology  is  recognized
for all the filth that it is. And if you do that, then suddenly every-
thing else becomes more attractive, and then you have this incred-
ible rush of creativity and innovation and jobs being created as we
go  out  to  take  on  that  incumbent  technology,  which,  by  the  way,
is fueled by some people who don’t like us very much.

And  so  I  just  wondered  whether  anybody  sees  it  that  way  or  if
you  want  to  make  a  spirited  defense  of  a  grant  kind  of  system  for
applied  technologies.  I  remember  opposing  in  this  committee,  I
didn’t  want  to  because  I  like  her  very  much,  but  Ms.  Giffords  had
a  bill  involving  the  installation  of  solar  panels,  training  people  to
install  solar  panels,  and  the,  I  opposed  that,  and  I  lost  on  a  vote
about 20 to three or something.

But  it  is  the  application  of  this  principle.  Do  you  really  want  to
do applied work through grants, or do you want to use a more effi-
cient way of getting the market to respond?

Mr. Parish, do you want to respond to that?
Mr. PARISH. Yes. And typically what we see, and I agree with in
that  we  need  to  identify  what  the  real  value  of  externalities  are,
because I think that would indeed help these alternative strategies
become  more  viable.  If  we  could  monetize  those  externalities  that
would make it even more viable.

However,  what  we  see  in  the  typical  development  cycle  or  R&D
cycle  for  new  technologies  is  that  the  government  funds  the  front
end  R&D  activity  to  get  the  basic  science,  to  develop  the  tech-
nology,  and  that  funding  starts  dropping  off  until  it  hits  a  valley
of  death  basically.  So  the  industry  is  sitting  there  with  a  tech-
nology  they  don’t  have  the  funds  to  bring  that  technology  to  mar-
ket,  and  so  that  is  one  of  the  things  that  Hybrid  Truck  Users

59

Forum does is tries to aggregate the pull, the demand for that par-
ticular  technology  to  get  it  out  of  the  OEM  and  get  it  on  the  road.
Now, we couldn’t have done that without the support of the U.S.
Army  National  Automotive  Center,  which  provided  us  funding  to
not only run the working groups but also to provide some up-front
buy-down funding. And what we have also learned, so we feel that
the government participation in trying to bridge that chasm is very
important because without that government funding to help bridge
that  chasm,  the  technology  could  very  well  just  disappear  and  not
be incorporated at all.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  we  are  here  not  talking  about,  it  is  not  a  ques-
tion  of  basic  science  here.  Right?  If  we  were  talking  the  batteries
and  better  battery  efficiencies  and  things  like  that,  that  would  be
more basic science. As it is what we are talking about is the appli-
cation  of  that  to  particular  uses,  right,  in  issues  like  warranties
which  Mr.  Penney,  I  think,  mentioned.  As  I  understand  it,  in  the
case  of  the  Volt,  that  is  a  real  issue  is  the  pricing  of  the  Volt  will
be affected by the warranty that they have got to issue.

And so working that out, I mean, just really became more of the
nature of economics and risk kind of allocation rather than science.
The  science  of  better  batteries  might  really  change  a  lot  of  what
we are talking about. Right?

Mr.  PARISH.  Right.  There  is  a  considerable  amount  of  money
being spent by the Department of Energy through the Department
of Energy on battery development, but it is particularly focused on
light-duty  batteries.  We  feel  that  demonstration  programs  are  a
very  important  aspect  of  this  activity,  and  the  government  has
been  involved  in  light-duty  fuel  cell  demonstration  programs  in
particular,  and  we  feel  like  this  is  also  necessary  for  the  medium-
and heavy-duty sector as well.

So  it  is  really  a  three-pronged  approach  that  we  would  like  to
propose  is  research  and  development,  which  talks  about  the
science,  what  is  really  necessary  to  bring  these  advanced  compo-
nents into being. Number two is demonstration programs so we can
actually  get  the  vehicles  on  the  road  and  get  people  interested  in
seeing  how  they  operate  and  seeing  how  they  actually  operate  in
service,  and  then  number  three,  incentives  to  make  the  purchase.
And  what  we  found  from  the  2005  Energy  Bill  is  that  tax  incen-
tives  do  work  for  some  segments,  but  not  all  segments.  What  we
have  seen  is  that  for  those  who  cannot  take  advantage  of  the  tax
incentives,  they  were  able  to  be  taken  by  the  seller  of  the  vehicle,
however, that savings was not passed along to the buyer of the ve-
hicle.  So  it  didn’t  fulfill  the  role  it  was  needed  to  at  that  point  in
time.

So  we  would  like  to  see  something  that  would  be  more  of  a  re-
bate  or  something  along  the  lines  that  would  make  sure  that  the
end-buyer,  the  end-user  did,  in  fact,  see  the  reduction  in  the  cost.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Ms.  Biggert,  you  are  recognized  for  five

and  we  haven’t  completed  that,  and  that  is,  I  am  concerned  with
a question that I asked Mr. Penney before. And still is what is pre-
venting  the  DOE  and  the  Department  of  Defense  from  collabo-
rating,  and  I  think  that  the  public  and  the  private  sector  would
benefit from a collaborative R&D effort.

But my next question then is, is there a role for universities and
national  labs  to  play  in  the  competitive  grant  program  created  by
the  Sensenbrenner  bill,  maybe  as  research  partners,  and  as  I  look
at  the  bill,  it  talks  about  the  five  grants,  and  then  it  talks  about
partners, which include other entities including manufacturers and
electric utility companies. But I think that there certainly is a role
for  the  labs  and  for  the  universities,  which  really  the  grant  pro-
gram  would  then  pull  the  technology  out  of  the  labs  and  get  the
technologies into the marketplace if we were to look at that.

I would like, if anybody would like to respond to that.
Mr.  PENNEY.  Certainly.  As  Mr.  Inglis  pointed  out,  you  know,  we
need to work together, but at the same time I don’t want to waste
my  energy  writing  proposals  for  Eaton  to  send  its  proposal  to  get
a  thing,  and  then  someone  else  comes  to  me,  and  I  want  our  staff
and  our  capability  to  be  available  to  everybody,  and  I  don’t  want
to waste the energy and the money to have to use our staff writing
proposals through competitive grants. Personally. For the lab point
of  view.  We  like  to  make  ourselves  available  to  all  companies,  and
it is an open source, open knowledge, education, and work through
a competitive process, through non-disclosures, et cetera.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  don’t  think  I  was  thinking  of  the  lab  as  actually
writing  the  grants  or  anything.  It  would  be  still  the—but  to  be
maybe a research partner that they would work with.

Mr. PENNEY. Right, but there has to be a flow of money, and part
of  the  disincentive  for  Eaton,  most  of  these  grants  or  most  of  the
programs  are  cost-shared,  50  percent  cost-shared.  We  can’t  cost
share.  We  can’t  use  government  money  to,  you  know,  cost  share
government  money  funding.  So  as  a  result  it  puts  a  burden,  an
extra  burden  on  an  Eaton  or  an  International  or  a  truck  company
to work with us or select us because they have to come up with our
cost share. So that disincentive needs to be taken away.

Ms. BIGGERT. Mr. Dalum.
Mr. DALUM. Yes. In my opinion the universities and national labs
can play a role in this. I am talking about testing, modeling, other
types  of  activities  that  could  help  promote  and  improve  the  tech-
nology.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  know  that  Argonne  Lab  does  have  the  Freedom

Car that they do the testing for a lot.

Mr.  DALUM.  Right.  And  there  are  other  universities  I  am  aware
of  in  Wisconsin  that  are  working  the  hydraulics  and  other  tech-
nologies  that  could  be  applied  perhaps  with  research  into  this  ap-
plication.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Would  anybody  like  to  comment  on  the  coordina-

tion between the DOE and DOD?

Mr. Parish.
Mr. PARISH. Yes. I think that has been attempted in 21st century
truck and I think as I had stated previously, the vision of that par-
ticular  activity  was  very  good,  and  I  think  it  was  a  good  forum  by
which there could have been a greater amount of interaction.

However, in actual practice it didn’t turn out quite that way, but
I think that given another try at it, you know, there is a possibility
that we could make that happen. I think perhaps with more vision-
ary  leadership  and  stronger  leadership  for  the  21  CT  that  would,
in fact, happen.

Plus,  if  we  had  some  real  funding  that  the—a  consortium  could
work  with  to  start  identifying  what  real  projects  were  viable,  do
some  competitive  grants  for  different  aspects  of  the  program,  I
think  that  would  be  very  worthwhile.  You  could  have  different
agencies looking at different aspects of the whole problem.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  want  to  thank  everyone  for  taking  the

time to appear before us today, this committee.

Under  the  rules  of  the  Committee,  the  record  will  be  held  open
for  two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit  additional  statements  and
any additional questions that they might have for the witnesses.

This hearing is now adjourned. Thank you.
