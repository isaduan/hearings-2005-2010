NOMINATIONS  TO  THE  DEPARTMENT  OF 
COMMERCE,  TRANSPORTATION  SECURITY 
ADMINISTRATION,  AND  DEPARTMENT  OF 
TRANSPORTATION 

THURSDAY,  JUNE  16,  2005

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  3:15  p.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens,
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We’ve  been  delayed  because  of  the  Appropria-
tions  Committee—a  Homeland  Security  bill  has  just  been  reported 
out—and also by two votes on the floor. I apologize to those who’ve 
been waiting. 

William Jeffrey had been nominated to be the Director of the Na-
tional  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  of  the  Department  of 
Commerce.  I  understand  that  Senator  Hutchison  was  here.  He  is 
joined by Senator Allen, who will introduce Mr. Jeffrey to the Com-
mittee.  Before  he  does,  Mr.  Jeffrey,  do  you  have  family  with  you 
today that you would like to introduce for the record? 

Dr. JEFFREY. Yes, I do. Thank you very much. I have two nieces, 
Courtney  and  Jennifer,  who  are  sitting  here,  as  well  as  several 
friends. And if Representative Ehlers were here, he would be proud 
to know they were from the State of Michigan. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you for accompanying Mr. Jeffrey. 
Senator Allen? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE ALLEN,

U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA 

Senator ALLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
It  is  my  pleasure  to  present  to  the  Committee  Dr.  William  Jef-
frey,  of  Herndon,  Virginia,  who’s  been  nominated  by  the  President 
to be the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology. 

It’s  good  to  have  your  nieces  here.  Michigan  was  once  a  part  of 

Virginia. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator ALLEN. To give you all a little history lesson here.

At  any  rate,  we’re  honored  that  the  President  has  once  again 
chosen  wisely.  Technology-based  innovation,  as  you  know,  Mr. 
Chairman, remains one of the nation’s most important competitive 
challenges.  Today,  more  than  at  any  other  time  in  our  history, 
technological  innovation  and  progress  depend  on  the  tools  that 
NIST helps develop to measure, evaluate, and standardize the tech-
nologies  that  emerge.  As  a  result  of  NIST’s  work  on  these  tools, 
we’re putting our companies, here in the United States, at the fore-
front of innovation. 

When I say the President has made a wise choice, if you look at 
Dr. Jeffrey’s technical leadership skills, his experience both in gov-
ernment  and  the  private  sector,  make  him,  truly,  an  outstanding 
choice  to  serve  as  Director  of  NIST.  He’s  been  involved  in  science 
and technology programs and policies since 1988. 

Dr.  Jeffrey  is  currently  the  Senior  Director  for  Homeland  Secu-
rity  and  National  Security,  and  the  Assistant  Director  for  Space 
and  Aeronautics  at  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy 
within  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President.  Prior  to  joining  the 
Bush  Administration,  Bill  was  with  DARPA—the  Defense  Ad-
vanced  Research  Projects  Agency,  which  is  obviously  very  well 
known  for  its  contributions  in  the  defense  and  technology  commu-
nity,  including  the  invention  of  the  Internet.  Dr.  Jeffrey  served  as 
the Deputy Director for the Advanced Technology Office, and Chief 
Scientist  for  the  Tactical  Technology  Office.  During  his  tenure 
there,  he  developed  research  programs  in  communications,  com-
puter  network  security,  novel  sensor  development,  and  space  oper-
ations. 

Besides being a fellow Virginian, Bill and I also share a commit-
ment  to  research  and  advancement  in  physical  sciences,  such  as 
nanotechnology. 

I’m  confident,  Mr.  Chairman,  your  examination  of  Dr.  Jeffrey’s 
record  will  show  that  he  is  going  to  serve  the  President  and,  most 
importantly,  the  American  people  very  well  as  the  Director  of 
NIST. I thank you for accommodating this hearing today so we can 
move forward with this outstanding nominee. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Allen. 
Do you have an opening statement to make, Senator? 
STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Senator INOUYE. May I have it printed in the record? 
The  CHAIRMAN.  The  Co-Chairman  wishes  his  statement  to  be 

placed in the record. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE,

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

Good morning. I want to thank Chairman Stevens for calling this hearing to con-
sider several of the nominations pending before our Committee. I congratulate each 
of  the  nominees  for  garnering  the  President’s  confidence  and  for  making  it  to  this 
important step in the process. 

Each  of  you  are  slated  to  fill  posts  that  are  critical  to  America’s  future  economic 
competitiveness.  From  new  technologies  to  global  trade,  from  advanced  research  to 
the  security  of  our  transportation  system,  the  work  performed  at  each  of  your  re-
spective agencies will help ensure that America remains a global, technological lead-
er and that our economy remains vibrant and secure.

Obviously, these agencies face tremendous challenges:
• The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been in a near constant 
state  of  reorganization,  which  has  made  their  essential  security  work  all  the 
more complicated.
• The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) is facing aging in-
frastructure,  and  its  critical  assistance  to  America’s  struggling  manufacturers 
is in jeopardy.
• The Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) is a brand new 
agency  that  will  need  to  define  its  role  and  establish  itself  amongst  the  other 
modal Administrations within the Department of Transportation.
• And,  the  Foreign  Commercial  Service  must  find  new  ways  to  balance  the  secu-
rity  demands  of  its  overseas  operations  while  maintaining  an  active,  visible 
presence in the markets it seeks to open.

Add to each of these individual challenges the government-wide budget restraints 
brought  on  by  historic  deficits  and  the  continual  demands  to  improve  performance, 
and your work is truly cut out for you. 

I  look  forward  to  a  spirited  conversation  today  as  we  examine  your  credentials 
and your perspectives, and I thank each of you for your commitment to public serv-
ice.  Should  you  be  confirmed,  I  can  assure  you  that  we  will  be  in  touch  regularly.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  first,  anyone  who’s  been  at  DARPA,  in  my 
judgment,  is  an  unsung  hero.  I  don’t  think  many  people  really  un-
derstand DARPA the way some of us who have served on this Com-
mittee  and  on  the  Defense  Appropriations  Subcommittee  do.  And 
I congratulate you for your service on that. 

Could  you  tell  me,  does  your  organization—now  that  you’re  join-
ing  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology—have  a 
significant role in homeland security now? 

NIST——

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  WILLIAM  JEFFREY,  NOMINEE  TO  BE
DIRECTOR  OF  THE  NATIONAL  INSTITUTE  OF  STANDARDS 
AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST), DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Dr. JEFFREY. Thank you, Senator. 
Yes, it does. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, 

The CHAIRMAN. Pull that mike back toward you, please. 
Dr.  JEFFREY.  Thank  you.  Yes,  NIST  actually  has  a  very  active 
role,  currently,  in  supporting  Homeland  Security.  NIST,  given  its 
technical  expertise,  is  essentially  one  of  the  go-to  places  that  the 
Federal Government has. For example, it’s working heavily on bio-
metrics research. It’s been dealing heavily in—actually, in the Sen-
ate  Office  Building,  at  the  anthrax  attack,  NIST  took  the  lead  in 
figuring  out  exactly  what  the  filter  should  be  for  the  mail  system, 
to protect us. They’re also taking a lead in the World Trade Center 
investigation. There’s a variety of issues that we’ve been looking at, 
and  they  play  a  very  significant  role.  And  I  would  expect  them  to 
play a significant role in the future. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Do  you  know  much  about  the  screening  tech-
nologies?  Will  you  be  involved  in  that  at  all?  There’s  been  some 
question  about  the  adequacy  and  efforts  in  the  screening  tech-
nology. Will you be dealing with that? 

Dr.  JEFFREY.  To  be  honest,  sir,  I  don’t  know  what  involvement 
NIST  has  with  screening.  I  know  that  they  have  supported,  in 
terms of some of the standard devices, basically looking at different 
kinds of materials that would go through airport screening. They’ve 
helped  to  calibrate  the  sensors,  but  I  don’t  have  a  lot  of  detail  for

you  today  as  to  what  the  growth  in  that  field  would  be.  I  would 
be glad to come back and respond to that. 

The CHAIRMAN. With your background, do you have any ideas on 
how  we  can  improve  that  system?  Please  let  us  know.  We’d  be 
pleased to work with you.

[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Dr.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR.  WILLIAM JEFFREY,  NOMINEE TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE 
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST),  DEPARTMENT OF 
COMMERCE 
Mr. Chairman, Co-Chairman Inouye, and Members of the Committee: Thank you 
for  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  regarding  my  nomination  to  be  the 
Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. I am honored to be 
nominated  to  this  position  by  President  Bush  and  I  wish  to  thank  Commerce  Sec-
retary Gutierrez for his support. 

I am excited by the prospect of leading NIST. For much of my professional career, 
I  have  been  a  user  of  NIST  products  including  data,  calibration  sources,  and  tech-
nical  assessments.  As  a  graduate  student,  one  of  my  most  dog-eared  books  was  the 
Handbook of Mathematical Functions which was edited by two NIST employees (at 
that time the National Bureau of Standards). Later when working on a Department 
of  Defense  infrared  satellite  I  relied  on  NIST  to  ensure  the  sensor  was  calibrated 
properly so that data coming from that satellite was reliable. More recently, I have 
interacted  with  NIST  on  homeland  security  standards,  their  assessment  of  the  effi-
cacy  of  radiation  to  kill  biological  organisms  in  the  mail,  and  their  evaluation  and 
recommendations  for  the  use  of  biometric  identifiers.  These  experiences  span  only 
a  small  subset  of  the  types  of  programs  within  the  NIST  Laboratories.  In  all  my 
experiences  and  interactions  with  NIST,  I  have  been  impressed  by  the  technical 
depth,  creativity,  and  responsiveness  of  the  Institute.  If  confirmed,  it  would  be  a 
privilege to be part of that organization. 

NIST is one of the crown jewels of the federal science and technology enterprise—
both  in  terms  of  quality  of  the  science  as  well  as  the  tremendous  positive  impact 
that  NIST  has  had  in  advancing  manufacturing  and  services,  facilitating  trade,  en-
hancing  public  safety  and  security,  and  in  improving  the  quality  of  life.  NIST’s 
broad technical capabilities have also made it the ‘‘go to’’ source for new techniques 
and  objective  analyses  to  address  critical  national  needs  such  as  those  that  arose 
out of 9/11. 

Maintaining  NIST’s  technical  excellence  and  relevance  has  never  been  more  im-
portant  to  our  nation.  Winning  the  global  war  on  terror,  defending  the  homeland, 
and  ensuring  our  economic  security  are  the  Administration’s  top  priorities—and 
NIST plays a vital role in supporting all three. For example, numerous studies have 
shown  the  importance  of  basic  research  and  technological  change  to  economic 
growth.  Whereas  the  United  States  is  still  the  world  leader  in  research  and  dis-
covery,  the  political  changes  and  technical  advances  in  the  last  twenty  years  have 
allowed a larger fraction of the world to participate in the global economy—creating 
both  increased  economic  competition  and  increased  opportunity.  The  United  States 
must  remain  the  leader  in  innovation,  continue  to  adapt  to  the  increased  pace  of 
technological  change,  and  be  vigilant  in  ensuring  fair  and  open  trade  practices.  If 
confirmed,  my  goal  would  be  to  enable  NIST  to  make  even  greater  contributions  to 
ensure U.S success in these important respects. 

NIST  plays  an  important  role  as  a  leader  in  innovation  and  enabling  industry  to 
adapt to technological change. Somewhat analogous to an athlete competing in ‘‘ex-
treme  sports,’’  NIST  competes  in  ‘‘extreme  science,’’  working  at  the  edge  of  current 
laboratory  capabilities—enabling  measurements  at  the  most  extreme  temperatures, 
the  shortest  timescales,  the  smallest  distances,  and  with  the  greatest  accuracy  and 
precision.  As  described  by  NIST,  ‘‘To  make  it  well,  you  must  be  able  to  control  it. 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  08:50 Feb 01, 2006 Jkt 025474 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\25474.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

5

To  control  it,  you  must  be  able  to  measure  it.’’  The  ability  to  push  the  envelope  of 
the  state-of-the-art  has  led  to  fundamental  breakthroughs  resulting  in  improved 
manufacturing  quality  and  efficiency  and  garnering  national  and  international  sci-
entific recognition. Maintaining and planning for upgrades to this capability—to en-
sure  continued  world-class  capability—requires  significant  resources  in  terms  of 
money  and  talent.  In  this  regard,  the  Congress  has  provided  important  resources 
with  recent  examples  being  the  Advanced  Measurement  Laboratory  and  the  Ad-
vanced Chemical Sciences Laboratory. If confirmed, I will work with Congress to en-
sure  the  necessary  world-class  infrastructure  and  talent  are  in  place—always  with 
the goal of ensuring that NIST strengthens America’s infrastructure for innovation. 
Relentlessly  innovating  and  constantly  adapting  to  technological  change  are  re-
quirements  for  success  in  the  global  economy—but  they  are  not  sufficient.  Stand-
ards,  for  example,  can  be  a  powerful  force  multiplier  in  opening  up  new  markets 
and developing new industries. However, standards can also be used to limit options 
and  to  negatively  impact  global  trade.  The  technical  expertise  and  credibility  of 
NIST  is  critical  to  the  Federal  Government  and  private  sector—providing  the  tech-
nical underpinning for measurement standards and helping to harmonize our stand-
ards with others around the world. NIST also supports the global recognition of U.S. 
standards, which are developed through consensus, in a transparent and open proc-
ess,  and  are  relevant,  responsive,  and  performance-based.  These  are  the  guiding 
principles  as  articulated  in  the  National  Standards  Strategy  for  the  United  States 
drafted  by  private  and  public  sector  organizations.  If  confirmed,  it  would  be  a  top 
priority of mine to maintain NIST’s strong presence in the standards setting process 
and to continue to champion a consensus-driven and open process globally, working 
closely with the private sector. 

NIST is also instrumental in improving the quality and performance of America’s 
businesses.  The  Baldrige  National  Quality  Program  is  the  premier  U.S.  award  for 
performance  excellence  and  quality  achievement.  One  measure  of  its  impact  is  the 
number  of  countries  around  the  world  that  have  established  programs  to  mimic  it. 
The  Baldrige  National  Quality  Program  is  a  successful  collaboration  of  the  private 
sector and federal and state governments. It will reach an important milestone this 
year—with the 1,000th application since award inception. With modest funding, this 
program  has  achieved  substantial  returns.  It  is  now  beginning  to  have  similar  im-
pacts among schools, hospitals and other education and healthcare organizations. 

The  Hollings  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  (MEP)  assists  small  to  me-
dium-sized  manufacturers  in  improving  quality  and  efficiency.  The  MEP  brings 
technical  and  managerial  expertise  to  the  largest  segment  of  the  nation’s  manufac-
turing  community  (based  on  number  of  establishments  and  number  of  employees). 
The MEP has formed strong partnerships with state and local governments and the 
private sector allowing the program to grow in numbers and scope. With nearly 350 
not-for-profit  centers,  the  program  has  now  achieved  a  presence  across  the  United 
States.  If  confirmed,  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Congress  to  devise  a  long-
term  strategy  consistent  with  the  program’s  value  and  overall  budget  priorities  for 
NIST. 

I have had the pleasure of meeting several of you and your staff since being nomi-
nated. For those whose schedules did not allow for a meeting prior to this hearing—
I look forward to meeting with you soon. In these discussions, while there was some 
disagreement  with  the  Administration  on  relative  priorities  of  some  programs,  it 
was  quite  clear  that  there  is  consensus  on  the  overall  value  of  NIST,  its  mission, 
and the need to maintain its technical preeminence. Maintaining NIST’s capabilities 
can  best  be  accomplished  by  working  together  to  ensure  consistency  and  stability 
in NIST’s long-term vision and direction. If confirmed, I will work with you and your 
staff towards this end. 

I would be pleased to address any questions you may have.

or friends that are here, Mr. Hernandez? 

Mr. HERNANDEZ. Yes, sir. Thank you, Senator. 
I  actually  have  my  sister  Elizabeth,  my  mother  and  my  father, 
who  came  up  from  Austin  and  Eagle  Pass,  Texas.  And  I  have  a 
great number of friends from DC, which are many and plenty here, 
seated  throughout  the  conference  room.  There’s  probably  too  many 
to name, so I will just say there’s a good representation.

crowd,  we  need  to  call  Mr.  Hernandez,  because  he  has  brought  a 
crowd here today. Very good. 

I’m  very  pleased  to  be  able  to  introduce  my  fellow  Texan,  Israel 
Hernandez, who has been nominated for the positions of—to be As-
sistant  Secretary  of  Commerce  and  Director  General  of  the  U.S. 
Foreign  and  Commercial  Service.  Mr.  Chairman,  he  will  be  a  su-
perb  Assistant  Secretary  and  Director.  He  has  worked  for  our 
President  since  he  was  Governor  of  Texas.  He  was  one  of  the  very 
first  people  employed  by  the  new  Governor  Bush.  His  hard  work 
and  dedication  earned  him  the  position  of  Deputy  Assistant  to  the 
President, after the President was elected. Mr. Hernandez assisted 
in  strategic  planning  and  intergovernmental  affairs  at  the  White 
House during the President’s first term. 

Currently, he is the Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Commerce 
and  the  Acting  Under  Secretary  for  International  Trade.  He  has 
worked so hard his whole life, and this is the area in which he will 
excel for sure. 

He  graduated  from  the  University  of  Texas,  and  he  was  in  the 
first  class  to  graduate  from  the  George  Bush—George  H.W.  Bush 
School of Government and Public Affairs at Texas A&M University. 
This  is  an  indication  that  Mr.  Hernandez  is  someday  going  into 
politics.  If  you  have  graduated  from  both  the  University  of  Texas 
and Texas A&M, this is a clue. So——

[Laughter.] 
Senator HUTCHISON.—I do think that he’s going to do a great job, 
and  I  highly  recommend  him  to  our  Commerce  Committee  and  for 
confirmation in the Senate. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  Mr.  Hernandez,  you’ve  been  nominated  to 
join  one  of  the  outstanding  leaders,  I  think,  of  our  country,  in  Mr. 
Gutierrez.  And  in  your  written  statement  you  mention  a  strategic 
vision for foreign and commercial service. Tell us about that vision. 
How  is  that  going  to  help  us  decrease  our  imbalance  in  trades,  in-
crease our exports? 

STATEMENT  OF  ISRAEL  HERNANDEZ,  NOMINEE  TO  BE
ASSISTANT  SECRETARY  FOR  TRADE  PROMOTION  AND
DIRECTOR  GENERAL,  UNITED  STATES  AND  FOREIGN
COMMERCIAL SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Mr. HERNANDEZ. Yes, sir. We live in a very dynamic time at this 
point,  and  we  need  to  recognize  the  changing  economies  in  the 
United  States  and  around  the  world.  And  one  of  my  goals  is  to 
make  sure  that—with  our  budget,  that  we  use  the  best  resources 
for  solutions  to  make  sure  that  our  small-  and  medium-sized  busi-
nesses  compete  and  have  greater  access  to  international  markets. 
So,  one  of  my  goals  is  to  constantly  try  to  find  ways—and  work 
with our wide network of specialists, which are located here in the 
United States and in 80 countries around the world—to make sure 
we  constantly  try  to  find  ways  to  increase  exports,  and  we  con-

stantly  try  to  find  ways  to  reduce  the  barriers  so  that  small-  and 
medium-sized companies have greater opportunities abroad. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Does  that  vision  include  some  way  to  giving  in-

centives to our small businesses to increase exports? 

Mr.  HERNANDEZ.  Sir,  what  we  do—what  we  would  do,  if  con-
firmed,  the  functions  of  the  Bureau  would  be  inherently  govern-
mental,  and—that  is  to  create  an  opportunity  for  small  businesses 
to  create  their—we  don’t  subsidize,  and  we  don’t  create  incentives; 
we  just  create  opportunities  for  small-  and  medium-sized  compa-
nies. So, I would say that our function would be to make sure that 
we  constantly  keep  in  line  the  obligations  of  working  agreements, 
that  we  work  from  government  to  government  to  try  to  create 
greater  opportunities  for  our  small-  and  medium-sized  companies, 
and  we  constantly  try  to  make  sure  that  we  trade—you  know,  de-
crease the barriers that exist today in foreign—in markets abroad. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. 
I’ve  had  the  privilege  of  meeting  Mr.  Hernandez  in  my  office. 
And, after the in-depth conversation I had with him, I’m convinced 
he will make a superb Assistant Secretary. 

Mr.  HERNANDEZ.  Thank  you,  Senator.  It  was  a  pleasure  to  meet 
you,  and  I  appreciate  the  time  you  gave  me.  And  you’re  actually 
one of the few Senators, or people, actually, in DC, who know about 
Eagle Pass, Texas. So, thank you for your time. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. HERNANDEZ. Thank you, Senator. 
[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Mr. 

Hernandez follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ISRAEL HERNANDEZ,  NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT
SECRETARY FOR TRADE PROMOTION AND DIRECTOR GENERAL,  UNITED STATES AND 
FOREIGN COMMERCIAL SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE 
Mr.  Chairman,  Co-Chairman  Inouye,  and  distinguished  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  thank  you  for  granting  me  this  hearing  today.  I  am  humbled  and  honored 
to  be  here  as  President  Bush’s  nominee  for  the  position  of  Assistant  Secretary  for 
Trade  Promotion  and  Director  General  of  the  United  States  and  Foreign  Commer-
cial Service. 

I would first like to thank my senator from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
for  her  kind  and  generous  introduction.  I  am  proud  of  her  service  and  her  commit-
ment  to  our  great  state  and  our  country,  and  I  am  proud  to  call  her  my  Senator. 
I would also like to thank President Bush and Secretary Gutierrez for supporting 

my nomination and note how proud I will be to work under their leadership. 

If confirmed, I look forward to working with each of you to ensure America builds 

on its status as the world’s largest exporter. 

In  the  world  of  the  21st  century,  opening  our  doors  to  trade  is  the  surest  way  to 
create opportunity for all Americans. Trade is about more than economics. Free and 
open trade fosters the spread of ideas and the habits of liberty—and ultimately en-
courages the spread of democracy, economic stability, and stronger partnerships. 

I  come  before  this  Committee  during  a  transformational  moment  in  history.  A 
time when democracy is taking hold around the world and when there is great shift 
in our economy and in economies abroad. 

Pursuit  of  liberty  and  new  opportunities  was  a  motivating  force  in  bringing  our 
Founding  Fathers  to  this  great  land,  and  it  is  this  freedom  that  has  become  the 
foundation  for  the  entrepreneurial  spirit  embedded  in  the  hearts  and  minds  of  the 
American people. 

From  the  first  electric  light—to  the  first  flight—to  nanotechnology,  the  entrepre-
neurial spirit that exists today has created a dynamic and vibrant community of en-
terprises  second  to  none.  Government’s  role  is  to  create  an  environment  where  en-
trepreneurs and risk takers can realize their dreams.

Giants  like  Ford  and  Microsoft  were  not  so  long  ago  small  businesses  striving  to 
realize the dreams of Henry Ford and Bill Gates. Today, small businesses create 70 
percent  of  new  American  jobs,  employ  the  majority  of  American  workers,  and  are 
responsible for the majority of our nation’s economic output. Small business owners 
are  economic  patriots  taking  risks  and  pursuing  dreams.  A  vibrant  small  business 
sector is necessary for the economic health of our country. 

If confirmed, I pledge to define and lead the Commercial Service based on a clear 
and strategic mission to ensure that small and medium sized businesses gain great-
er  access  to  international  markets.  I  will  hold  myself  and  the  entire  organization 
to  a  standard  of  accountability  that  demands  efficiency,  consistency,  and  profes-
sionalism. I will ensure that the team of specialists within the Service has the tools 
necessary to anticipate the commercial interests of our American exporters and rap-
idly adapt on the ground to meet their needs. 

The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, created by Congress a quarter century 
ago,  does  what  no  other  entity  in  the  United  States  can  do—provide  a  global  infra-
structure  in  more  than  80  countries  and  a  domestic  platform  in  109  cities  with  the 
exclusive  purpose  of  promoting  American  goods  and  services  and  ensuring  a  level 
playing field abroad. In 2004, the volume of those sales exceeded $26 billion. 

The  Commercial  Service  offers  end-to-end  export  solutions  to  help  smaller  firms 
increase  profits  and  lower  risks  in  accessing  markets  otherwise  difficult  to  enter. 
The  worldwide  network  of  trade  specialists  provides  export  counseling,  customized 
market  research,  trade  leads,  and  advocacy  to  help  companies  compete  in  global 
markets.  This  worldwide  network  is  essential  to  today’s  market  economy  in  which 
95 percent of the world’s consumers live outside of the United States. 

U.S.  exports  support  millions  of  American  jobs.  About  one  of  every  five  factory 
jobs—or  20  percent  of  all  jobs  in  America’s  manufacturing  sector—depends  on  ex-
ports. Research has shown that workers in jobs supported by exports typically earn 
wages higher than the national average. 

If  confirmed,  I  will  be  a  disciplined  and  accountable  steward  of  the  people’s 
money.  I  will  commit  to  a  thorough  assessment  of  our  resources  to  ensure  that  the 
Commercial Service not only meets but exceeds the highest expectations. I will work 
to  build  on  the  essential  relationships  with  partners  at  the  federal,  state,  and  local 
level. 

Theodore  Roosevelt  was  right  when  he  said,  ‘‘The  best  executive  is  the  one  who 
has  sense  enough  to  pick  good  men  to  do  what  he  wants  done  and  self-restraint 
enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it.’’ Any organization is only 
as  good  as  its  people,  and  I  will  work  to  foster  a  diverse  environment  where  our 
men and women in the Service continue to grow in discipline and expertise and pro-
vide  the  highest  quality  of  service  to  our  constituents—American  businesses  and 
their  employees,  owners,  and  communities.  Integrity,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness 
will be at the core of everything I seek to accomplish. 

I hail from the Southwest Texas border, often considered one of the last frontiers 
in the U.S. The privilege to be here with you today is a testament to America’s place 
as a haven for dreamers and doers. My loved ones—my family and my friends—and 
our diverse community represent America’s potential, and I wish to thank them for 
all  they  have  done  (and  will  do)  to  support  me  in  the  vast  opportunities  on  which 
I embark. 

Still  today  people  from  around  the  world  see  America  as  a  land  of  freedom  and 
opportunity. The President once said, ‘‘We in the United States live in liberty, trade 
in  freedom,  and  grow  in  prosperity.’’  We  certainly  face  challenges,  but  we  also  face 
a  world  of  great  opportunities,  and  a  choice  on  how  to  proceed.  If  confirmed,  I  look 
forward  to  the  challenge  of  helping  ensure  that  our  nation—and  its  economy—re-
mains a beacon for the world. 

Thank you for your time. I will be happy to answer any questions you might have 

and welcome your comments.

disclosures?

Yes, if confirmed by the Senate, I will make it a priority to ensure that the Of-
fice  of  Trade  Promotion  and  U.S.  and  Foreign  Commercial  Service  Office  pro-
tects congressional witnesses and whistle blowers from reprisal.

3.  Will  you  cooperate  in  providing  the  Committee  with  requested  witnesses,  in-

mund ‘‘Kip’’ Hawley and Mr. Ashok Kaveeshwar.

The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Hawley  has  been  nominated  to  head  the 
Transportation  Security  Administration.  He’s  no  stranger  to  this 
Committee. He’s familiar with our work on transportation security 
over the years. TSA is now in its fourth year of existence, and faced 
a  number  of  challenges.  Foremost  is  streamlining  the  passenger 
screening process through programs like the Registered Traveler or 
through  new  technology.  TSA  must  be  able  to  accommodate  a 
record number of passengers going through our airports in the com-
ing year. 

And,  Mr.  Kaveeshwar,  you  have  been  nominated  to  be  the  first 
Administrator  of  Research  and  Innovative  Technologies  Adminis-
tration at the Department of Transportation. 

Now, may I first ask if either of you have families you would like 

to introduce here today? 

Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I’d like to thank the Committee for 
having this hearing on the Internet, because my family is not able 
to  attend,  and  they  are  able  to  participate  through  the  Internet. 
However,  I  did  find  a  friend  of  my  son’s  from  high  school,  John 
Delpuro, who is——

[Laughter.] 
Mr. HAWLEY.—who was here on a tour. And so——
[Laughter.] 
Mr. HAWLEY.—John is my surrogate son. 
[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Nobody’s  ever  alone  in  the  Internet  days  now. 

Very good. 

Mr. Kaveeshwar, do you have any family you’d like to introduce? 
Dr.  KAVEESHWAR.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’d  like  to  introduce  my 
wife Tuti, and my son Jay. I also have some friends who have trav-
eled far and wide, and I won’t mention all their names, but we’re—
I’m very glad that they’re here. 

The CHAIRMAN. Wonderful. Well, we thank you. 
Mr. Hawley, Secretary Chertoff and the Inspector General, at the 
Department, have indicated that human screeners have limits with 
respect to accuracy and effectiveness, and that new screening tech-
nologies must be made available to improve security beyond the ex-
isting point. Can you give us the status of deploying the new detec-
tion systems, as passenger screening, the ‘‘puffer’’ systems, or other 
such systems nationwide? Have you been briefed on that? 
STATEMENT  OF  EDMUND  S.  ‘‘KIP’’  HAWLEY,  NOMINEE  TO  BE 
SECURITY,

ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY  OF  HOMELAND 
TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. The so-called ‘‘puffer’’ system, which is ex-
ceptionally  good  at  detecting  explosives,  is  being  rolled  out  in  a 
pilot. And I believe today there was an announcement of expanding 
that pilot to more airports. So, the focus on explosive detection and 
more  sophisticated  technologies—such  that  they  can  apply  to  pas-
sengers  and  passenger  carry-on  bags—is  an  important  part  of  the 
ongoing program. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Well,  how  soon  will  you  use  the  eye  scan  for  a 

data bank that can be called up anywhere? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  The  whole  biometric  solution,  as  Mr.  Jeffrey  was 
describing because NIST is a big partner in this—is being explored

via  pilots  with  a  variety  of  biometric  ways,  including  eye  scans. 
And  the  Department,  as  a  whole,  has  made  a  lot  of  effort  in  the 
area of biometrics—including fingerprints, for US–VISIT. These ef-
forts  would  be  interesting  for  TSA  to  look  at  to  see  what  we  could 
leverage  from  other  groups  within  the  Department  that  we  might 
be able to deploy in TSA’s mission, if confirmed. 

The CHAIRMAN. Do you have any questions for Mr. Hawley? 
Senator INOUYE. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you’ve indi-
cated,  Mr.  Hawley’s  experience  with  the  Transportation  post,  I 
think  this  experience  would  be  most  helpful  in  this  new  position. 
Do you believe that TSA is the central place where direction and 
policymaking  decisions  be  made  involving  all  modes  of  transpor-
tation? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Yes,  sir.  Almost  by  definition,  the  U.S.  transpor-
tation  network  crosses  all  modes.  And,  I  think  that  whether  it’s  a 
package  or  a  person,  whether  on  a  train,  bus,  airplane,  truck, 
whatever—that’s  a  matter  of  convenience  and  economics,  but  look-
ing  at  the  entire  network  of  the  United  States  is  intermodal,  and 
I believe that that is essentially the role of TSA. 

Senator INOUYE. As one who represents an island state, I’m obvi-
ously  concerned  about  port  security.  Do  you  have  any  thoughts  on 
that? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  It’s  a  integral  part  of  the  network,  and  I  know  it 
is  a  subject  of  a  lot  of  attention  from  the  Secretary.  In  his  review 
of departmental activities, I know it is a top priority. And TSA and 
the  Coast  Guard  have  significant  expertise  in  the  area.  Customs/
Border Patrol currently has major action on the port security. But, 
at  the  strategic  level  of  the  network,  I  believe,  that  TSA  has  a  lot 
to add to that equation, and is a player, along with, obviously, the 
Coast Guard, which owns the ports, themselves. 

Senator  INOUYE.  Mr.  Chairman,  I’m  satisfied  that  Mr.  Hawley 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Senator  Pryor,  do  you  have  any  comments  for 

will do a good job. 

Mr. Hawley? 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator PRYOR. I have a few questions. 
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
First,  Mr.  Hawley,  thank  you  for  being  here.  And  I  think  every-
body  would  agree—I  hope  they  would—that  the  Senate  Commerce 
Committee  has  really  led  the  way  in  pushing  for  increased  federal 
efforts  to  help  secure  our  nation’s  passenger  and  freight  railroads. 
As  a  former  railroad  employee  with  Union  Pacific,  do  you  believe 
that  the  TSA  is  doing  enough  to  help  railroads  meet  security 
needs? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  I  should  first  say  I  don’t  really  know  everything 
that TSA has done in the rail sector. However, in response to Sen-
ator  Inouye’s  question  about  the  network  and  the  modes,  rail  is  a 
vital  part  of  the  national  transportation  system,  in  both  passenger 
and  freight;  and,  as  such,  needs  a  very  strong  level  of  security  as 
a major component of the network. So, with the rail infrastructure 
owned by the private sector, and many efforts executed by the pri-

vate  sector,  I  know  that  there  is  a  partnership  between  TSA  the 
private sector and Amtrak and state and local governments, so that 
it  all  works  together,  although  not  necessarily  by  TSA  employees. 
Senator  PRYOR.  OK.  Do  you  think  that  the  TSA  is  doing 

enough—is TSA doing enough, as best you can tell? 

Mr. HAWLEY. On rail? 
Senator PRYOR. Yes. 
Mr.  HAWLEY.  You  know,  I  don’t  know  enough  to  know  the  an-

swer. My instinct is, the whole network——

Senator PRYOR. Yes. 
Mr. HAWLEY.—is doing very well, and doing enough. I don’t know 
exactly what the division of labor is. I know that the TSOC, which 
is  the  operating  center  for  TSA,  that  all  modes  are  looked  at.  And 
I  know  that  the  American  freight  railroads  have  been  very  active, 
from immediately after 9/11, to put in place their own security that 
was  coordinated  with  the  Federal  Government.  So,  I  think  the 
overall security of that portion of the network is very strong. As to 
how much of it TSA is actually doing, hands on, I’m not——

Senator PRYOR. Do you——
Mr. HAWLEY.—exactly sure. 
Senator  PRYOR.—do  you  know  enough  to  comment  on  Amtrak 

and what needs to be done to make Amtrak more secure? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  It’s  part  of  the  overall  network—obviously  in  the 
urban  areas,  particularly  in  the  Northeast—and  is  a  vital  compo-
nent,  and  there  are  other  urban  areas  where  passenger  rail—Am-
trak  and  other  commuter  rail—is  critical.  And  I  know  there  have 
been  pilot  studies  done  on  various  forms  of  screening.  I  mean,  it’s 
really  all  part  of  the  Secretary’s  risk-based  analysis  of  the  trans-
portation network as to the proper division of responsibility and in-
vestment. 

Senator PRYOR. And, in your view, is TSA the right agency—are 
they  the  right  agency  to  be  the  lead  agency  for  rail  security,  or 
should——

Mr. HAWLEY. Yes. 
Senator PRYOR.—this fall somewhere else? 
Mr. HAWLEY. No, I think it is. I think it is, as part of its network 
responsibilities.  And  I  should  say  that  that’s  a—the  Secretary  is 
doing  a  review  of  the  Department.  Obviously,  I’m  a  private  citizen 
now, and whatever the Secretary determines will have——

Senator PRYOR. Let me switch gears, if I can, to air. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  PRYOR.  I  don’t  know  if  you’re  familiar  with  so-called 

‘‘inline baggage screening’’——

Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR.—‘‘systems.’’ Do you know about that? 
Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Supposedly,  there  have  been  some  studies,  and 
the  sense  is  that  inline  baggage  screening  systems  would  save 
money  by  increasing  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  Are  you  familiar 
with that? 

Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  PRYOR.  And  is  one  of  your  priorities  going  to  be  to  try 

to expand inline——

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Senator,  I  think  the  priority  would  be  to  promote 
the  security  and  efficiency,  where,  in  certain  conditions,  particu-
larly large airports, inline is the way to go; whereas, a lot of other, 
maybe,  smaller  airports  with  different  physical  characteristics, 
there  are  better  solutions  that  can  get  the  flow  of  bags  going 
through  more  appropriately.  Because  there’s  a  major  capital  cost 
and  ongoing  operating  expenses  that  happen  with  the  inline  that 
you  really  have  to  have  quite  a  bit  of  volume  to  make  it  cost  out. 
And  there  are  other  kinds  of  machines.  The  Reveal  technology  is 
a  good  example  of  a  smaller  footprint,  yet  highly  effective,  explo-
sive-detection system that can be deployed effectively, as well. 

Senator  PRYOR.  OK,  great.  Now,  one  last  line  of  questioning,  if 
you  will,  and  that  is,  after  9/11,  you—as  I  understand  it,  you 
helped coordinate the federalized airport screening mission at TSA? 

Mr. HAWLEY. The standup of the agency, yes, sir. 
Senator PRYOR. Right. And since that time there’s been a number 

of concerns about the screener staffing levels? 

Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  PRYOR.  Right?  And  let  me  ask  this.  What  role  did  you 
play  in  the  contracting  for  services  to  develop  the  screener  work-
force? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  None,  directly;  although  as  part  of  the—the  way  I 
would  describe  what  I  did  was  on  the  architecture  side.  Secretary 
Mineta said we have the ATSA requirements. You know, the Presi-
dent  signed  the  ATSA  bill,  and  this  Committee  wrote  most  of  it. 
The  charge  that  Secretary  Mineta  had  was,  ‘‘Get  those  deadlines 
accomplished, figure out a way that we can roll out, hit those dead-
lines,  get  the  agency  up  and  standing,  and  do  it  within  the  time-
frames.  And,  by  the  way,  don’t  miss  any  deadlines.’’  So,  my  major 
focus  was  to  try  to  put  in  place  the  processes  that  would  get  the 
major  pieces  rolling  and  then  come  together  in  time  to  provide  an 
effective  security  regime.  Then,  as  the  Department  grew,  that  the 
agency  would  fill  in  the  pieces.  And  so,  with  all  the  moving  parts, 
my  role  was  more  at  the  level  of,  ‘‘OK,  how  do  we  keep  this  going 
and sequenced,’’ as opposed to the actual execution of contracts. 

Senator  PRYOR.  So,  does  that  mean  that,  for  example,  you 
would—you  were  not  involved  in  setting  the  staffing  level  for  the 
number of screeners? 

Mr. HAWLEY. You know, at a very high level, certainly, I was in-
volved  in  the  process,  and  I  think,  to  the  point  of  the  10-minute 
rule  that  the  Secretary  announced,  which  is,  ‘‘We’re  going  to  have 
world-class  security,  world-class  customer  service’’—and  by  that,  I 
mean  10-minute  average  wait  time  at  the  checkpoint—and  so  that 
what  I  did  with  that  was  say,  ‘‘OK,  we  have  to  design  a  process 
now,  at  this  checkpoint,  that  starts  with  the  10-minute  rule,  and 
then  work  backwards,’’  as  opposed  to  say,  ‘‘Let’s  put  a  process  in, 
and  whatever  it  is,  it  is.’’  The  Secretary  was  very  clear,  ‘‘I  don’t 
want people waiting more than an average of 10 minutes.’’ And so, 
that  drove  the  process  to  be  able  to  have  a  consistent,  repeatable, 
10-minute process. 

Senator  PRYOR.  Is  it  your  opinion  that  we  have  enough  screen-

Mr.  HAWLEY.  I  don’t  know.  And  I  think  that  clearly,  that  is  a 
major,  major  piece  of  the  puzzle.  Another  major  piece  is  the  fund-

ers?

ing  of  the  agency.  At  this  point  it  is  a  little  up  in  the  air.  And  the 
right mix of machinery and people is the critical driver of this. The 
charge  that,  if  confirmed,  I  have  from  Secretary  Chertoff,  is,  ‘‘Se-
cure  the  security,  and  do  it  efficiently,  bring  on  the  technology,  in 
the right way that you can, so that it works.’’

Senator PRYOR. Mr. Chairman, that’s all I have. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Hawley. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Thank you. 
The CHAIRMAN. We will be pleased to bring your name before the 

Committee at the next mark-up. 

Mr. HAWLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Mr. 

Hawley follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
Chairman Stevens, Senator Inouye, and distinguished Members of the Committee, 
I am honored to appear before you today. I am grateful to President Bush for nomi-
nating me to serve as Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for TSA. 

Thank  you  for  your  prompt  consideration  of  my  nomination  and  for  the  Com-
mittee  making  these  proceedings  available  on  the  internet.  My  wife  Janet  and  our 
two  sons,  not  to  mention  my  Mom  &  Dad,  were  unable  to  attend  here  today,  so  I 
know that they are all watching somewhere out there, no doubt offering suggestions 
for questions and answers. 

As  you  know  from  my  background  material,  I  have  spent  most  of  my  career  in 
various  parts  of  the  transportation  and  technology  worlds,  in  staff,  operating,  and 
executive jobs. Like many Americans, after 9/11 I wanted to do something about it, 
and  I  feel  fortunate  that  I  had  that  opportunity.  Working  for  Secretary  Mineta  in 
the  months  following  9/11,  I  and  a  handful  of  private  sector  executives  worked 
alongside  Deputy  Secretary  Jackson  and  the  many  outstanding  people  at  the  De-
partment of Transportation and elsewhere who came together to help stand-up TSA. 
I went home to California in May 2002, and back into business. 

Three  years  later,  I  have  had  the  chance  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  TSA,  and  there 

appear to be two over-arching, but conflicting, realities. 

First,  the  talent  deployed  at  TSA,  from  top  to  bottom,  from  start-up  to  the 
present, has been excellent in my opinion. Very highly skilled people from all walks 
of  life—public  sector,  private  sector,  science,  academia,  the  military,  the  corporate 
world,  basically  everywhere,  have  stepped  forward  to  work  on  this  mission,  moti-
vated  by  the  urgency  and  importance  of  TSA’s  mission.  I  have  seen  this  first-hand. 
The second, and conflicting, reality is that there is clearly widespread frustration 
with  TSA’s  performance  here  on  Capitol  Hill.  Members  of  the  Committee  have  ex-
pressed that frustration to me during my courtesy calls and I have seen it watching 
hearings and reading transcripts on both the Senate and House sides. 

If I am right about both observations, then bringing the second reality in line with 
the  first  requires  more  than  a  change  of  players  at  the  top  or  anywhere.  In  other 
words  I  am  not  here  to  suggest  that  I  am  the  answer  for  TSA,  but  rather  that,  if 
confirmed,  I  would  seek  to  bring  together  those  with  a  stake  in  TSA’s  mission  and, 
together, line up in a common effort. 

If confirmed, here’s the approach I would take.
• Clarity of Mission: Secretary Chertoff has outlined a clear vision for the Depart-
ment based on a disciplined risk-management approach to investment and oper-
ational priorities. I believe in that vision and would seek to make it fully oper-
ational at TSA and develop a clear sense of necessary priorities with employees, 
along with public and private stakeholders.
• Align  Resources:  The  next  step  would  be  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  TSA’s  oper-
ations  and  investments  to  see  if  and  where  changes  are  needed  to  more  effi-
ciently and effectively accomplish the mission.
• Engage  Employees:  In  just  the  short  time  that  I  have  been  re-introduced  to 
TSA,  the  commitment  of  its  employees—at  all  levels—is  obvious.  There  are 
plenty of ideas and it would be a priority of mine to enable and encourage solu-
tion-oriented thinking throughout the organization.

22

• Partnership:  Like  most  of  DHS,  TSA  works  as  part  of  a  network  of  players  to 
do  its  job.  The  success  of  the  network  depends  on  all  parties  communicating 
openly as worthy partners.
• Management Systems: Tying this all together, I would work to get in place the 
training  and  performance  management  systems  necessary  to  measure  our 
progress  and  give  the  Administration,  Congress,  and  TSA’s  stakeholders  accu-
rate and timely information with which to evaluate TSA’s effectiveness.

The  last  three,  Employees,  Partners,  and  Management,  were  certainly  priorities 
of  the  previous  heads  of  TSA.  I  think  what  is  different  about  these  approaches  is 
that  the  first  two  foundations—Clarity  of  Mission,  and  Aligning  Resources—have 
yet to be done by TSA. 

The TSA was created in an emergency situation and was in a full sprint for over 
a  year  to  get  the  ATSA  requirements  in  place  and  restore  public  confidence  in  the 
safety  of  America’s  transportation  system.  After  the  ATSA  requirements  were 
achieved, the TSA had the formidable job of trying to execute its daily mission while 
trying  to  fill  in  the  management  infrastructure  and  at  the  same  time  integrating 
into DHS. Not surprisingly, given the intense scrutiny of TSA, there were also plen-
ty of other front-burner issues. 

Secretary  Chertoff’s  fresh  look  is  really  the  first  chance  to  review  the  Depart-
ment’s activities in a comprehensive way since 9/11. This is why I believe that TSA 
now  has  the  opportunity  to  leverage  the  lessons  learned  and  new  ideas  that  have 
been  generated  by  TSA’s  talent  and  others  to  recalibrate  the  mission  and  re-align 
TSA’s resources as necessary. 

I  believe  that  my  previous  experience  in  government  and  in  the  private  sector—
mostly  working  on  the  nexus  between  transportation  and  technology—prepares  me 
to understand and act on the input that would come from within and outside DHS/
TSA. 

I  believe  that  TSA,  in  addition  to  having  a  critical  national  mission,  is  a  special 
place.  It  is  made  up  of  highly-skilled  and  highly-motivated  people,  every  one  of 
whom  stepped  up  to  serve  the  country  in  the  aftermath  of  9/11.  Should  the  Senate 
confirm  me,  it  would  be  an  honor  to  join  them  in  service  to  the  Department  and 
to the nation.

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Kaveeshwar, I’ve got to confess, I’ve mislaid 

your background statement. Tell us a little bit about yourself. 

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ASHOK  KAVEESHWAR,  NOMINEE  TO  BE 
ADMINISTRATOR  OF  THE  RESEARCH  AND  INNOVATIVE 
TECHNOLOGY  ADMINISTRATION  (RITA),  DEPARTMENT  OF 
TRANSPORTATION 
Dr. KAVEESHWAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  think,  back  in  1961,  I  left  my  hometown  of  Indor,  in  Central 
India,  after  receiving  a  1-year  scholarship  to  Fredonia  State  Col-
lege  in  Upstate  New  York.  And  I  guess  I’m  here  before  you  today 
because  of  the  goodwill  of  a  lot  of  people,  but  I’d  like  to  mention 
two—Bob  McLaren  and  Professor  Stanley  Zarlock,  who,  in  their 
own  ways,  helped  me  in  my  early  times,  one,  to  get  me  to  pursue 
a Ph.D. in physics, another to tide me over a summertime. 

The—other  than  that  background,  I  did  research  in  theoretical 
physics.  And,  following  that,  I  left  the  academia  and  entered  the 
private  sector.  I  started  as  a  technical  project  manager,  then  grew 
through  a  series  of  positions,  and,  ultimately,  to  run  the  company, 
as the chief operating officer, and then the company was sold. The 
company  was  called  SD  Systems  Corporation.  We  used  to  call  it 
SDX.  It  started  as  a  small  business.  When  I  joined,  it  had  about 
ten people, and I managed half of those; and then it grew to a sub-
stantial  size,  about  a  thousand  people,  or  so.  Our  work  was  with 
NASA and NOAA and FAA and a lot of different government agen-
cies  around  town.  It  was  sold  to  Hughes  Aircraft,  so  I  moved  over 
and  became  a  part  of  a  much  larger  organization,  and  part  of  my 
responsibility  and  challenge,  if  you  will,  was  to  take  a  company 
that  was  privately  held,  and  become  a  part  of  a  much  larger  orga-
nization—very  large—aerospace  and  defense  corporation.  And 
when  the  business  of  Hughes  Electronics  was  sold  to  Raytheon,  I 
moved over to Raytheon Corporation and managed a large division 
of Raytheon Corporation. 

So,  that’s  been  my  background,  in  technical  research,  as  well  as 

technical management and general management. 

The CHAIRMAN. Well, that’s wonderful. You’re to be involved now 
in  an  area  of  transportation  that  is  fairly  important  to  my  own 
state.  We  have  enormous  transportation  challenges—cold-weather 
temperatures, distance, the size of our state, so many other things,

pipelines,  runways.  Will  this  group  now—you  are  with  the  Re-
search  and  Innovative  Technology  Administration—will  that  look 
at ways to mitigate the effects of changing temperatures, new ways 
to deal with the changes of the climate system? 

Dr.  KAVEESHWAR.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  RITA,  as  you  just  stated, 
is a very new administration. It’s—I will be the first administrator, 
as you mentioned. And I will be—if confirmed, look into that, and—
but there will be an involvement from RITA to look at these kinds 
of problems, yes. 

The CHAIRMAN. How many staff do you expect to have there? 
Dr. KAVEESHWAR. The way RITA is configured now, we have the 
Volpe  National  Transportation  System  Center,  which  is  in  Boston, 
so—it  has  a  staff  of  somewhere  in  the  neighborhood  of  500  or  so. 
The  Bureau  of  Transportation  Statistics  would  also  be  part  of 
RITA, because part of the responsibility is to do transportation sta-
tistics,  and  research  and  reporting.  And  then,  in  addition  to  that, 
the  immediate  staff  will  be—well,  there  is  a  university  research—
what you call technology centers—will also be part of this organiza-
tion, and the Office of Intermodalism. So, all together there will be 
about 850 people. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Sounds  like  they’re  mostly  East-Coast  oriented. 

Is that right? 

Dr.  KAVEESHWAR.  No,  we  have  some  people  in  Alaska,  as  well, 
and  we  are—I  understand  that  there  is  some  things  that  we  are 
working  on  to—with  the  FAA  Administrator—that  will  get  re-
solved. If I get confirmed, I’ll work with your staff. 

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Inouye? 
Senator INOUYE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
As you’ve noted, you’ll be the first Administrator of RITA, so you 
would  have  a  wide  latitude  in  shaping  the  goals  and  policy  of  this 
new agency within DOT. What are your highest priorities? 

Dr.  KAVEESHWAR.  When  I  had  the  conversation  with  Secretary 
Mineta, one of his charges in—first when he recommended that the 
Congress  form  this  agency,  and  when  he—what  he  told  me  was 
that he would like to see this agency coordinate the research that’s 
going—R&D  work  that’s  going  on  across  DOT.  So,  my  highest  pri-
ority  is  really  twofold.  One  is  to  identify  the  challenges  that  face 
the—America’s transportation system, the identification, itself; and 
then,  second,  to  coordinate  the  research  that  DOT  is  undertaking. 
It’s  in  the  neighborhood  of  about  a  billion  dollars  a  year.  And  this 
agency,  RITA,  is  not  the  one  that’s  going  to  be  doing  it.  All  the 
modal administrators will be doing—but I would be involved in co-
ordinating that. 

Senator  INOUYE.  I  had  an  opportunity  to  ride  on  the  so-called 
Bullet  train  in  Japan,  and  there’s  a  similar  one  in  Beijing.  Do  you 
think  we’ll  ever  have  something  like  that  here  in  the  United 
States? 

Dr.  KAVEESHWAR.  Senator,  that’s  certainly  not  speaking  as  a,  if 
confirmed, Administrator of RITA, but if I have to, as a private cit-
izen, and if I have to guess, I believe we will. 

Senator INOUYE. Well, there’s been no movement, until now. 
Dr. KAVEESHWAR. That’s correct. 
Senator  INOUYE.  But  will  your  RITA  participate  in  developing 

such a train?

27

Dr.  KAVEESHWAR.  One  of  the  other  charges  that  Secretary  Mi-
neta  has  talked  to  me  about,  and—when  they  created  the  RITA—
is that the word ‘‘innovative technology,’’ although this Bullet train 
you mentioned is not necessarily innovative, in the sense that it is 
already functioning in a couple of places—but the answer is yes. 

Senator INOUYE. Mr. Chairman, I’m convinced he’ll make a good 

administrator. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Yes,  we  welcome  you,  and  welcome  this  new  in-
novative  entity  in  transportation.  I  was  sitting  here  thinking  of  a 
friend of mine, now deceased, who was spending his time trying to 
figure out how to use helium-filled balloons to lift containers off the 
ground and propel them, with some sort of an engine, so that they 
would  move  throughout  the  country  without  being  on  the  roads. 
Somewhere,  there’s  an  answer  to  this—to  all  this  congestion  that 
we’ve got. 

Dr. KAVEESHWAR. Absolutely. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  So,  we  look  forward  to  working  with  you,  and 

welcome you to this entity—this agency. 

That  will  complete  our  hearing  today.  We’ll  take  up  these  nomi-

nations at the next—I think it’s next Thursday. 

Thank you very much. 
Dr. KAVEESHWAR. Thank you. 
[The  prepared  statement  and  biographical  information  of  Dr. 

Kaveeshwar follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. ASHOK KAVEESHWAR, NOMINEE TO BE ADMINISTRATOR 
OF THE RESEARCH AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY ADMINISTRATION (RITA),
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
Thank  you  Chairman  Stevens,  Senator  Inouye  and  other  distinguished  Members 

of the Committee. 

It  is  a  tremendous  honor  to  have  been  nominated  by  President  Bush  and  to  ap-
pear  before  you  today.  If  confirmed,  I  look  forward  to  joining  Secretary  Mineta  and 
his  superb  leadership  team  at  the  Department  of  Transportation,  and  to  working 
closely with you and your staff. 

I  am  very  happy  that  my  wife,  Tuti,  and  our  son,  Jaya,  are  here  with  me  today, 
and with your indulgence, I would like to recognize and express my appreciation to 
them.  I  know  my  93-year  old  father  in  India,  Gajanan  Kaveeshwar,  whom  we  call 
Bhau,  is  thrilled  beyond  imagination.  Unfortunately,  because  of  his  advanced  age 
and  great  distance,  he  cannot  join  us  today.  I  would  also  like  to  recognize  my  late 
and  beloved  mother,  Kaki,  who  passed  away  recently.  In  addition,  I  would  like  to 
acknowledge  my  many  other  family  members  and  friends,  some  of  whom  are  here 
today. 

Although there are commonalities in every immigrant’s journey toward the Amer-
ican  dream,  each  path  is  unique.  In  1961,  I  left  my  hometown  of  Indore  in  central 
India  after  receiving  a  one-year  scholarship  to  Fredonia  State  College  in  upstate 
New  York.  I’m  here  before  you  today,  because  of  the  goodwill  of  people  like  Bob 
McLarin,  whose  family  took  me  in  for  a  summer,  and  Professor  Stanley  Zarlock, 
who took a special interest in me and encouraged me to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics. 
Bob McLarin, Professor Zarlock, and millions of Americans like them, represent the 
special character and spirit of this nation that makes the American dream a reality 
for so many. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  come  before  you  today  as  President 
Bush’s nominee to be the first Administrator of the Department of Transportation’s 
Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA). 

It  is  a  great  honor  to  be  asked  to  serve  in  this  capacity.  As  envisioned  by  Sec-
retary  Mineta  and  enacted  by  Congress  through  last  year’s  passage  of  the  Norman 
Y.  Mineta  Research  and  Special  Programs  Improvement  Act,  RITA  is  the  Adminis-
tration  primarily  dedicated  to  Research,  Development  and  Technology  coordination 
throughout DOT. Hence, by its very nature, RITA will have a cross-modal focus that 
will ensure that all RD&T investments are effective and directly tied to DOT’s stra-
tegic goals.

RITA’s  mission  is  to  identify  and  facilitate  solutions  to  the  challenges  and  oppor-

tunities facing America’s transportation system. 

I believe my background in academic research and in industry make me well suit-
ed to carry out the responsibilities of RITA. I began my professional career as a re-
searcher in theoretical physics. In 1974, I left academia to join a small company as 
a technical project manager and then progressively rose through the ranks and ulti-
mately became the chief operating officer. The company provided research and tech-
nology  development  to  a  wide  range  of  Federal  Government  agencies.  In  1991,  the 
company  was  acquired  and  I  successfully  managed  our  transition  from  an  inde-
pendent  company  to  an  integrated  member  of  a  large  aerospace  and  defense  cor-
poration.  This  varied  background—from  technical  research  to  managing  a  large  or-
ganization—provides  that  combination  of  technical  and  leadership  skills  that  will 
allow me to successfully lead RITA and to achieve its goals. 

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, if confirmed, I look forward to working 
with you, others in the Administration, DOT’s stakeholders in the private and pub-
lic  sectors,  and  with  RITA’s  capable  and  talented  staff  to  fulfill  the  vision  that  re-
sulted in the creation of RITA. 

Again, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today, and I look for-

ward to answering any questions you may have.

A P P E N D I X

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO

EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY 

Question 1. Many on the Committee believe that TSA must do a better job of de-
ploying  new  technologies  at  airports.  TSA  has  certified  Next-Generation  EDS  tech-
nology that is far smaller and less expensive than the current generation of screen-
ing  systems.  And  I  am  told  a  significant  number  of  airports  have  asked  that  TSA 
provide  them  with  these  Next-Generation  EDS  systems  because  for  their  situation 
they would: (1) enhance security, (2) are less costly to operate, and (3) do not require 
the costly construction of baggage systems. This seems like a win/win situation since 
some airports want Next-Generation EDS, and their deployment will save taxpayer 
dollars.  Will  you  commit  to  move  quickly  to  follow  Congress’s  direction  and  expedi-
tiously deploy these Next Generation systems? 

Answer.  If  confirmed,  I  will  be  forward  leaning  in  exploring  the  best  ways  to 
maximize  checked  baggage  screening  effectiveness  and  throughput.  TSA  will  con-
tinue to devote the necessary resources to ensure there is 100 percent checked bag-
gage screening at all of the nation’s commercial airports and exploring the universe 
of emerging technologies. 

It  is  my  understanding  that  TSA’s  next  generation  research  and  development  ef-
forts have yielded two new products during FY 2005. The Reveal CT–80 is the first 
new product and is a smaller less expensive EDS unit, which may be an appropriate 
solution for airports that have been reliant on explosives detection trace (ETD) units 
exclusively.  The  use  of  EDS,  rather  than  ETD,  increases  efficiency  and  streamlines 
the processing of bags. During the ongoing pilot tests, TSA will be able to determine 
the  level  of  staffing  that  will  be  required  to  support  operation  of  the  EDS  versus 
what  is  currently  required  to  support  other  technology.  The  other  product  that  has 
been  certified  is  the  Analogic  6400,  which  is  an  upgrade  kit  for  the  L–3  eXaminer 
6000 EDS unit, of which TSA has over 600 currently deployed. This system upgrade 
will  incrementally  increase  the  baggage  throughput  capacity  for  the  L–3  6000  and 
provide improved image resolution tools, resulting in fewer bags requiring secondary 
screening.

Question  2.  Of  the  projects  TSA  is  running,  the  TWIC  project  has  been  a  cause 
of concern. TSA awarded the prototype contract last August for $12 million and an-
nounced  that  TSA  would  issue  150,000  TWIC  cards  at  40  sites  across  the  country 
over  a  7-month  period  concluding  in  March  2005.  It  is  now  June;  CQ  reported  on 
April 21, that the contract had more than doubled in size to $24.4 million; and other 
news reports indicate that only a couple thousand TWIC cards have been issued and 
at  less  than  half  the  sites  anticipated.  How  is  it  that  the  prototype  contract  has 
managed  to  double  in  size  while  delivering  so  much  less,  1/100th,  than  originally 
promised? 

Answer.  I  share  your  concerns  regarding  the  TWIC  program.  It  is  my  under-
standing that additional costs you cited were attributable to new requirements that 
emerged  after  the  contract  award.  Specifically,  TSA  re-evaluated  the  requirements 
and  re-aligned  them  after  the  release  of  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive-
12 (HSPD–12) a new government directive regarding credentials which was released 
on  August  27,  2004—two  weeks  after  the  Prototype  Phase  contract  was  awarded. 
Changes included procurement of standards-based biometric readers, obtaining card 
production  and  system  hosting  services  (previously  planned  to  be  government-fur-
nished),  and  extending  the  contract’s  period  of  performance  to  ensure  continuity  of 
operations  for  stakeholders  involved  in  the  prototype  phase.  As  a  result  of  these 
scope  changes,  the  contract  baseline  was  revised  to  reflect  the  updated  cost  esti-
mates and period of performance. 

Despite  the  low  number  of  enrollees,  TSA  believes  that  the  TWIC  prototype  suc-
cessfully  met  its  objectives.  Given  that  participation  in  the  prototype  phase  was 
largely  voluntary,  it  was  difficult  to  predict  how  many  individuals  would  enroll. 
However,  TSA  was  appreciative  of  those  who  willingly  participated.  As  a  result  of

their volunteer participation, the transportation industry and TSA learned valuable 
lessons that will help guide the program’s future as implementation moves forward.

Question 2a. What is TSA doing to get the project on a more solid footing? 
Answer. It is my understanding that TSA is currently analyzing the results of the 
prototype  phase  which  ended  on  June  30,  2005,  and  will  be  making  recommenda-
tions to DHS with respect to implementation. 

I understand there are policy decisions that need to be made before TSA can move 
the TWIC Program into an implementation phase. These decisions include an appro-
priate  cost  (fee)  for  the  credential  and  background  checks,  the  immediate  scope  of 
the program, and the procedures for enrollment and card issuance. 

If confirmed, I will make it a top priority to engage the Department in the issues 

and move the program forward.

Question  3.  The  TWIC  Prototype  Project  was  awarded  August  10,  2004,  and  was 
supposed  to  run  for  a  7-month  period  ending  March  10,  2005.  Because  of  delays  in 
the  program,  TSA  announced  in  March  that  a  3-month  extension  was  granted  for 
it, which means that it should have wrapped up last Friday, June 10. Has the proto-
type concluded and what has TSA accomplished with it? 

Answer. It is my understanding that TSA is currently analyzing the results of the 
prototype  phase  which  ended  on  June  30,  2005,  and  will  be  making  recommenda-
tions to DHS with respect to implementation.

Question  3a.  What  are  TSA’s  plans  for  procurement  of  the  next  phase  of  the 

Answer.  It  is  my  understanding  that  TSA  anticipates  procurement  for  the  next 
phase of the TWIC to be based on full and open competition, subject to Department 
approval.

TWIC? 

Question  4.  Regarding  the  troubles  with  the  TWIC  program,  it  was  very  dis-
turbing to read in the May 23, 2005 issue of Washington Technology. They reported 
the  contract  for  TWIC  has  doubled  in  size;  it  is  behind  schedule;  and  it  has  failed 
to  deliver  more  than  a  couple  thousand  of  the  150,000  cards  that  were  supposed  to 
be issued. Specifically, the story quoted TSA as saying that the main reason for the 
delays  and  cost  overruns  was  that  ‘‘ TSA  officials  had  modified  the  TWIC  schedule 
to  take  into  account  biometric  standards  mandated  by  Homeland  Security  Presi-
dential  Directive-12  (HSPD–12),  which  came  in  late  August  2004,  days  after  DHS 
awarded the TWIC contract to BearingPoint.’’ This statement is puzzling on a num-
ber of fronts: HSPD–12 establishes a Policy for Common Identification Standard for 
Federal Employees and Federal Contractors. That’s it. No commercial truck drivers, 
no  port  workers,  no  airport  baggage  handlers  and  no  rail  yard  workers.  But  it  is 
this later group that is to be issued TWIC cards. So why is it that more than 3 years 
after September 11, the TSA would delay a major project because of a new directive 
that does not even apply to the TWIC program? 

Answer.  I  share  your  concerns  regarding  the  TWIC  program  and,  if  confirmed, 
will  make  it  a  priority  to  move  the  program  forward.  It  is  my  understanding  that 
while  HSPD–12  is  not  specifically  directed  at  the  TWIC  program,  TSA  believed  it 
would  be  short-sighted  to  ignore  this  directive  and  new  government-wide  require-
ments regarding credentials.

Question  5.  There  are  no  biometric  standards,  which  exist  today  as  a  result  of 
HSPD–12. NIST has released a draft standards document (NIST SP 800–76) which 
proposes what biometrics would be used for cards issued to Federal Employees and 
Contractors, however, both NIST and industry have agreed that there are numerous 
problems with the draft, and a large portion of the draft is certain to change by the 
time that these problems are resolved. With no usable biometrics standard that has 
yet emerged from HSPD–12, what standard is TSA building the program to? 

Answer.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  TWIC  program  is  based  on  the  newly 
released  biometric  standards  issued  by  the  American  National  Standards  Institute 
(ANSI)/International  Committee  for  Information  Technology  Standards  (INCITS), 
including standards for finger prints, iris, face recognition and other biometric inter-
operability standards.

Question 6. CQ reported on April 21, that BearingPoint was not just hired to build 
the  TWIC  system  for  TSA,  it  was  also  hired  under  a  completely  separate  contract 
to  also  help  manage  the  program  for  TSA.  Moreover,  as  part  of  these  management 
responsibilities,  BearingPoint  actually  was  hired  to  write  large  portions  of  the  RFP 
for  the  TWIC  procurement  and  determine  many  of  the  TWIC’s  technical  require-
ments. According to the CQ article, BearingPoint’s project management responsibil-
ities  are  ‘‘to  determine  if  the  project  is  on  schedule,  within  budget,  proceeding  in 
conformance with approved plans and specifications, and is being implemented effi-
ciently and effectively.’’ In other words, they’ve been hired to evaluate the perform-

ance  of  another  team  of  staff  from  their  own  company.  Is  TSA  concerned  that  with 
such a tight system of checks and balances within the TWIC program that the con-
tract has ballooned to more than twice its awarded size and still is under-delivered? 
Answer.  It  is  my  understanding  that  BearingPoint  submitted  an  Organization 
Conflict  of  Interest  (OCI)  Mitigation  Plan  containing  measures  and  procedures  to 
prevent a conflict of interest in performing both Prototype and Project Management 
Office support work related to the same project. This plan was accepted by TSA and 
subsequently  reviewed  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration’s  Office  of  Dispute 
Resolution  for  Acquisition  (ODRA),  which  found  it  acceptable  and  reasonable.  TSA 
monitors compliance with the OCI Mitigation Plan on an ongoing basis.

Question  6a.  Is  TSA  taking  any  steps  to  avoid  potential  conflicts  of  interest  on 

contracting issues in the future? 

Answer. It is my understanding that through the acquisition planning process, as 
required by the TSA Acquisition Planning Guide, potential OCI issues are addressed 
to  ensure  conflicts  of  interests  are  appropriately  avoided  or  mitigated.  In  several 
cases, TSA has proactively taken steps to address similar issues by revising acquisi-
tion  strategies  to  avoid  OCIs.  In  these  cases,  the  contractors  have  been  issued  let-
ters notifying them that they cannot provide program management support and im-
plementation  services.  Further,  TSA  solicitations  include  OCI  provisions  which  re-
quire the contractors to identify potential OCIs and to recommend a mitigation plan.

Question  1.  It  has  been  almost  4  years  since  the  9/11  terrorist  attacks,  and  over 
a year has gone by since terrorists exploded bombs aboard commuter trains in Ma-
drid.  Assuming  you  are  confirmed  to  be  the  next  TSA  Administrator,  what  specific 
steps will you do to ensure that all modes of transportation, transit, rail, maritime, 
and aviation are secure? 

Answer.  The  diversity  and  expansiveness  of  the  transportation  system  presents 
inherent  security  challenges.  Each  of  the  major  transportation  modes  has  unique 
characteristics,  operating  models,  responsibilities  and  stakeholders.  The  transpor-
tation modes also differ with respect to the level of Federal involvement. Tradition-
ally, the Federal Government has been much more actively engaged in the security 
aspects  of  the  aviation  and  maritime  modes  of  transportation.  The  government  has 
played  a  more  limited  role  in  surface  transportation  security  due  to  the  extent  of 
state and local government, and private sector ownership, and the general openness 
and breadth of these systems. 

For this reason, the Federal Government must focus resources on the basis of con-
sequence, threat and vulnerability assessments, and the prioritization of risks. This 
concept is the foundation of a risk-based, threat-managed methodology which allows 
the  Federal  Government  to  implement  appropriate  layers  of  security  across  all 
modes 

Under  DHS  leadership,  TSA  is  responsible  for  (1)  assessing  risk  to  the  system 
across  a  changing  array  of  threats,  (2)  sharing  threat  and  risk  information  with 
transportation  partners  and  stakeholders  (public  and  private),  (3)  establishing  con-
sistent  national  transportation  security  standards  across  all  modes,  (4)  verifying 
compliance  with  those  standards,  and  (5)  in  the  event  of  a  transportation  security 
incident, ensuring rapid restoration of service and public confidence. 

The success of transportation security rests on the close partnership between DHS 
and transportation stakeholders. While clearly private investment in security is ex-
pected,  the  threat-based  risk-managed  approach,  complemented  by  performance 
based  standards—which  permits  achievement  of  security  standards  within  an  own-
er’s  business  model—coupled  with  appropriate  security  grants,  mitigates  the  na-
tional cost borne by the private stakeholders.

Question  1.  President  Bush  refuses  to  budget  any  funding  for  new  EDS  equip-
ment,  so  only  nine  airports  of  the  430  will  get  newer,  faster  equipment.  He  also 
claims that wait lines and security levels will be no worse in 2006. As head of TSA, 
how will you guarantee this? 

Answer.  I  firmly  believe  that  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA) 
should  continue  to  devote  the  necessary  resources  to  ensure  there  is  100  percent 
checked  baggage  screening  at  all  of  the  nation’s  commercial  airports,  and  this  will

continue  whether  the  equipment  configuration  is  stand-alone  or  in-line.  While  as  a 
general rule in-line systems are more efficient than other kinds of explosives detec-
tion systems, it is not appropriate for the configuration at every airport. While there 
are  certain  security  benefits  that  come  from  the  use  of  in-line  systems,  airports 
without  such  systems  are  not  vulnerable.  Each  airport  has  its  own  TSA-approved 
Airport Security Plan (ASP) designed to meet its individual needs. 

However,  in-line  explosives  detection  systems  (EDS)  are  deployed  as  a  cost  effec-
tive screening process at many of the higher volume airports. TSA is developing cri-
teria that will result in a comprehensive review in which TSA will identify the uni-
verse  of  airports  that  may  benefit  from  an  in-line  EDS  system  or  other  physical 
modification,  as  well  as  identify  project  costs  and  savings  that  could  be  achieved 
through  minimizing  staffing  requirements  and  maximizing  technology  capabilities. 
TSA is also operationally testing a newly certified EDS unit—the Reveal CT–80—
that  should  provide  TSA  with  an  alternative  to  in-line  systems  for  some  airports. 
This  new  unit  is  much  smaller  and  will  be  less  expensive  than  the  current  EDS 
units. At certain airports, the Reveal CT–80 may be appropriate to install as stand 
alone units within and/or immediately behind airline ticket counters, which will ne-
cessitate  lobby  modifications  rather  than  behind-the-scenes  conveyor  system  modi-
fications.  TSA  does  not  anticipate  that  this  new  unit  will  be  a  viable  solution  for 
all  airports  due  to  throughput  capabilities;  however,  it  will  provide  an  alternative 
for consideration in future planning. 

TSA’s  Fiscal  Year  2005  budget  for  EDS  installation  is  $473  million,  and  is  being 

allocated in the following categories:

• Support for the current Letters of Intents (LOIs)—$310 million 
• Funding for support services contracts—$52.64 million 
• Funding for large hub airports—$66.61 million 
• Funding for medium hub airports—$25 million 
• Funding for small and non-hub airports—$18.75 million

* Funding  for  equipment  purchase  is  a  separate  budget  item,  and  it  is  funded 
at $180 million for FY 2005.

The  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2006  budget  request  includes  $394  million  for  EDS 
deployment. Of this amount, $260.5 million is dedicated to supporting the eight ex-
isting  Letters  of  Intent  (LOI)  airports.  Of  the  $260.5  million,  $240.5  million  is  for 
direct reimbursements to airports and $20 million is for equipment and installation. 
Additionally,  the  request  includes  $134  million  to  purchase  and  install  Explosives 
Detection  Systems  and  Electronic  Trace  Detection  equipment  at  non-LOI  airports. 
If  confirmed,  I  will  make  it  a  priority  to  ensure  that  the  technology  necessary  to 
ensure  security  at  our  nation’s  airports  is  deployed  using  available  resources.  I 
would also continue TSA’s work on ensuring that the traveling public is not overbur-
dened  with  lengthy  wait  times  without  compromising  security.  Airports  would  con-
tinue  to  collect  and  report  wait  time  data,  to  allow  TSA  to  monitor  the  customer 
experience  and  to  assist  TSA  in  making  improvements  to  checkpoint  configurations 
and  appropriate  staffing  levels.  Wait  times,  which  on  average  were  already  low, 
have  decreased  since  collection  began  in  earnest  in  January  of  2004.  When  wait 
times  during  2004  and  2005  are  compared  monthly,  they  are  found  to  be  lower  for 
2005  than  the  previous  year.  These  decreases  are  especially  dramatic  considering 
the increase in passenger throughput from 2004 to 2005.

cent or more than one and a half minutes since 2004.

2004.

In addition, it is important to note that TSA found in its annual customer service 
survey that between 80 and 95 percent of passengers gave positive responses when 
asked  about  seven  aspects  of  the  federal  security  screening  process,  which  included 
thoroughness  and  courtesy  of  screeners  as  well  as  confidence  in  TSA’s  ability  to 
keep air travel secure. In addition, the survey found the TSA is meeting or exceed-
ing passenger expectations for security line wait times.

Question  2.  The  President  asked  for  $8  million  for  rail  security  next  year.  With 
such a small amount of money, how do you expect to safeguard our nation’s rail sys-
tems  after  terrorist  acts  like  the  Madrid  bombings  or  the  attack  in  Russia  on  Sun-
day? 

Answer. If confirmed, I will re-evaluate budget priorities in light of the recent at-
tacks  in  London.  As  you  know,  the  threat  level  was  raised  from  Code  Yellow—or

Elevated—to  Code  Orange—or  High—targeted  only  to  the  mass  transit  portion  of 
the  transportation  sector.  This  includes  regional  and  inter-city  passenger  rail,  sub-
ways  and  metropolitan  bus  systems.  Ensuring  that  our  nation’s  transportation  sys-
tems  are  secure  must  be  accomplished  through  effective  partnering  between  appro-
priate  federal,  state,  local  and  private  industry  entities.  And  of  course,  DHS  is 
charged  with  responsibility  for  working  to  protect  all  modes  of  transportation,  but 
it  has  consistently  held  that  this  responsibility  must  be  shared  with  federal,  state, 
local  and  private  industry  partners,  many  of  whom  were  already  in  the  business  of 
providing security for their particular piece of the transportation puzzle. 

TSA,  in  support  of  the  DHS  Office  of  State  and  Local  Government  Coordination 
and Preparedness (SLGCP), has provided transportation security subject matter ex-
pertise in support of the UASI and other competitive grant programs SLGCP admin-
isters for security in surface modes of transportation including ports, trucks, busses, 
rail  (freight  and  passenger),  and  mass  transit.  The  President’s  FY  2006  budget  for 
the Department would also establish a consolidated Targeted Infrastructure Protec-
tion  Program  (TIPP),  funded  at  $600  million,  for  an  integrated,  discretionary  grant 
program  to  better  supplement  state,  local,  and  private  sector  infrastructure  protec-
tion  efforts  based  on  threat,  vulnerability,  and  criticality.  TIPP  will  allow  greater 
flexibility  to  the  Secretary  to  allocate  funds  according  to  the  greatest  risk  so  that 
we may best enhance the ability of the owners and operators of key transit systems 
and  port  assets  to  prevent  and  respond  to  transportation  security  incidents.  Since 
FY02, DHS has awarded close to a billion dollars in grants for these modes—$315M 
in FY05 alone. 

In  addition  to  TIPP,  the  President’s  FY  2006  budget  recognizes  the  need  for  re-
sources  in  this  sector  by  providing  public  transportation  grants,  outside  of  Urban 
Area  Security  Initiative  (UASI)  grants,  which  cover  such  programs  as  rail/mass 
transit inspectors, use of canine explosive detection teams in mass transit, intercity 
bus  security  improvements,  hazardous  materials  truck  tracking,  and  Highway 
Watch,  among  others.  If  confirmed,  I  will  be  an  active  participant,  among  many  in 
the  Administration,  in  seeking  to  optimize  the  use  of  federal  resources  to  the  high-
est risks and security needs.

Question  3.  Only  5  percent  of  the  9  million  ocean  shipping  containers  that  come 
into  our  country  are  actually  inspected  at  ports.  What  will  you  do  to  fix  this  lax 
security at our ports? 

Answer.  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  was  certainly  established 
to coordinate all of the efforts of various agencies in securing our homeland. In ful-
filling  this  mission,  it  builds  on  the  strengths  and  expertise  of  all  of  the  agencies 
that work with each mode of transportation. 

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), of course, is the lead agency for maritime security 
issues  due  to  its  decades  of  experience  and  powerful  assets  focused  on  securing  the 
maritime  domain.  Within  this  framework,  the  Transportation  Security  Administra-
tion  (TSA)  supports  the  USCG  in  the  execution  of  certain  responsibilities  where 
leveraging of TSA’s expertise may be appropriate, including the development of mar-
itime passenger screening standards and transportation worker credentials. 

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the lead entity within DHS for exe-
cution of cargo container security inspections in the international shipping environ-
ment.  However,  recognizing  the  intermodal  nature  of  cargo  shipments,  the  Border 
and Transportation Security (BTS) Directorate has been delegated authority and re-
sponsibility  for  developing  a  secure  system  of  transportation  for  intermodal  cargo 
shipments and container security performance standards. 

BTS is supported by both CBP and TSA in the execution of these responsibilities. 
If confirmed, I will certainly encourage TSA to continue to play a pivotal role in this 
area. 

I  understand  TSA  has  collaborated  with  U.S.  CBP  and  USCG  to  conduct  a  pro-
gram analysis of all current cargo security programs in all modes both domestically 
and  internationally  under  the  leadership  of  BTS.  The  goal  of  this  analysis  was  to 
investigate  the  various  cargo  security  programs  within  DHS  and  to  measure  their 
effectiveness. 

Another  example  of  interagency  cooperation  is  Operation  Safe  Commerce.  Oper-
ation  Safe  Commerce  is  an  interagency  program  that  tracks  cargo  from  its  inter-
national  point  of  origin  to  its  final  domestic  point  of  destination  through  multiple 
modes  of  transportation.  TSA,  CBP,  and  the  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT) 
acted  as  co-chairs  of  the  program  with  TSA  serving  as  the  National  Coordinator. 
Further representatives from USCG, the Department of Defense, the Department of 
State, and the Department of Commerce are also represented on the program’s Ex-
ecutive Steering Committee. 

Additionally,  TSA  and  USCG  has  assisted  the  Department’s  Office  of  State  and 
Local  Government  Coordination  (SLGCP)  in  evaluating  grant  applications  for  the

disbursement  of  port  security  funds  appropriated  by  Congress.  TSA  has  provided 
transportation security subject matter expertise in support of the Urban Area Secu-
rity Initiative (UASI) and other competitive grant programs SLGCP administers for 
security  in  surface  modes  of  transportation  including  ports,  trucks,  busses,  rail 
(freight and passenger), and mass transit. Since Fiscal Year 2002, DHS has award-
ed  close  to  a  billion  dollars  in  grants  for  these  modes—$315M  in  FY05  alone.  With 
certain  limitations,  some  of  these  grant  funds  have  been  used  for  capital  security 
improvements by the recipients. 

It  is  my  understanding  that  the  President’s  FY  2006  budget  for  the  Department 
would  establish  a  consolidated  Targeted  Infrastructure  Protection  Program  (TIPP), 
to  be  administered  by  SLGCP,  which  will  allow  greater  flexibility  to  the  Secretary 
to  allocate  funds  according  to  the  greatest  risk  so  that  we  may  best  enhance  the 
ability of the owners and operators of key transit systems and port assets to prevent 
and respond to transportation security incidents. 

TIPP  would  consolidate  grants  to  protect  critical  national  infrastructures  such  as 
seaports,  mass  transit,  railways,  and  energy  facilities  into  a  single,  comprehensive 
program based on need, risk, and consistency with national priorities. The Transpor-
tation Security Administration (TSA) is supportive of this consolidation and believes 
that such prioritization will ensure that redundancies are minimized and that funds 
are directed to the best use. TSA staff will continue to provide SLGCP with subject 
matter expertise for transportation security.

Hon. TED STEVENS, 
Chairman, 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, 
Washington, DC.
Dear Mr. Chairman:

On behalf of the members of the Air Carrier Association of America and the com-
munities we serve, we fully support the nomination of Edmund S. Hawley to be As-
sistant Secretary of Homeland Security (TSA). Although the Transportation Security 
Administration and the Department of Homeland Security have made important ad-
justments to the nation’s security program, they still face enormous challenges. We 
recognize  that  more  needs  to  be  accomplished.  For  this  reason,  it  is  important  to 
have someone in the Assistant Secretary position who is familiar with aviation and 
how  best  to  accomplish  government  objectives.  We  believe  that  Mr.  Hawley  is  that 
person since, as a member of the Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Serv-
ices Committee, he is familiar with the nation’s airline system. He has also worked 
to create unique industry/government partnerships which would be important as we 
address all security issues. 

The  continued  enhancement  of  airport  security  is  particularly  important  for  low-
fare  carriers  and  smaller  markets.  As  these  carriers  expand,  local  job  growth  and 
economic development will increase. 

For all of these reasons, we fully support Mr. Hawley’s nomination to be Assistant 

Secretary of Homeland Security. 

Sincerely, 

EDWARD P. FABERMAN, 

Executive Director.

pleasure to work closely with Mr. Hawley during the days and months following the 
tragic  events  of  9/11  as  he  worked  diligently  at  the  Department  of  Transportation 
with  Congress  and  industry  to  ‘‘stand-up’’  the  Transportation  Security  Administra-
tion (TSA). 

His  strong  organizational  skills  and  depth  of  experience  with  transportation 
issues  will  provide  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  with  strong 
and  capable  leadership.  NBAA  strongly  supports  his  confirmation  and  urges  the 
Committee to act favorably on his nomination.

Hon. TED STEVENS,

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Ranking Member,
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, 
Washington, DC.

Dear Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye:
On behalf of the National Air Carrier Association (NACA) and its 17 member air-
lines,  we  wish  to  convey  to  you  our  full  support  for  the  President’s  nomination  of 
Mr.  Edmund  ‘‘Kip’’  Hawley  to  be  Assistant  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  for  the 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA). 

Mr.  Hawley  has  previously  demonstrated  in  both  government  and  in  the  private 
sector  that  he  has  outstanding  leadership  skills.  The  Nation  cannot  afford  to  leave 
this office vacant for long, and Kip Hawley is the right man for the job. We respect-
fully request that you schedule a full Committee vote on his nomination as soon as 
possible,  so  that  the  Senate  may  schedule  a  vote  and  promptly  confirm  him  to  this 
critical post. 

Your service to the Nation on this important issue is greatly appreciated. 

Sincerely, 

RONALD N. PRIDDY, 

President. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE AIRFORWARDERS ASSOCIATION 

The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  agencies  under  its  umbrella  are 
entering a critical stage as the department continues to refine its role and oversight 
in  securing  America  against  attack.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration 
continues  to  evolve  in  its  mission  to  ensure  the  highest  level  of  safety  in  all  modes 
of  transportation,  with  particular  attention  to  aviation  security.  Regardless  of  what 
the  future  holds  for  TSA,  we  believe  that  the  nomination  and  confirmation  of  Ed-
mund  Hawley  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  agency  in  this  important  redefini-
tion  phase.  The  Airforwarders  Association,  the  industry  voice  for  air  cargo  compa-
nies  and  their  partners,  has  established  a  close  working  relationship  with  the  De-
partment  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  and  Transportation  Security  Administration 
(TSA) and looks forward to continuing that relationship with Mr. Hawley as Assist-
ant Secretary. 

Mr.  Hawley  has  a  strong  background  in  transportation  issues,  particularly  with 
regards  to  supply  chain  management  and  technological  solutions  to  security  issues. 
As  the  next  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Transportation  Security  Administration,  he 
will be faced with decisions that will have a substantial impact on the nation’s sup-
ply  chain,  which  is  in  many  ways  America’s  economic  lifeline.  His  experience  will 
certainly aid him in pursuing security solutions without compromising economic vi-
tality.  His  work  both  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  and  as  Vice  Presi-
dent  of  Union  Pacific  Railroad’s  Transport  Services  division  are  equally  important 
in the quest to make all modes of transportation secure. 

His management skills, particularly in this regard, will be crucial to guiding TSA 
in  this  transitional  period.  In  addition  to  his  work  with  TSA,  his  experience  with 
the Department of Transportation under President Reagan aids in his ability to un-
derstand  and  manipulate  interagency  politics.  This  communication  experience  com-

bined  with  his  technological  background  make  Mr.  Hawley  particularly  suited  for 
TSA’s ‘‘high tech makeover’’ as Rep. John Mica (R–FL) stated. 

Mr.  Hawley  has  been  involved  with  the  Transportation  Security  Administration 
since its inception, where he was responsible for forming and overseeing private sec-
tor executives that helped the fledgling agency create its duties and meet deadlines. 
The early efficiency of the TSA has been credited to much of the collaborative work 
taken  on  by  Mr.  Hawley.  We  believe  part  of  what  has  made  the  reforms  imple-
mented  by  the  agency  successful  to  date  has  been  the  willingness  to  reach  out  to 
affected  industries  by  establishing  working  groups,  discussions  and  seminars.  Initi-
ating  a  dialogue  with  industry  has  eased  the  burden  of  new  and  expansive  regula-
tions for many businesses that saw their concerns and questions addressed. 

Without TSA’s commitment to incorporate industry concerns into crafting regula-
tions, many businesses could have been severely crippled or even eliminated during 
the  wave  of  regulations  in  2001  and  early  2002.  The  Airforwarders  Association  has 
been honored to participate in a number of these working groups, both prior to and 
after the inception of DHS and TSA. We have long been a part of the Aviation Secu-
rity  Advisory  Committee,  which  recently  produced  more  than  40  recommendations 
for  improving  air  cargo  security,  many  which  were  included  in  the  newly  proposed 
TSA rules. 

The air cargo industry is a $17 billion dollar industry that directly employs thou-
sands of Americans in both small businesses and internationally recognized compa-
nies.  A  healthy  air  cargo  industry  ensures  financial  benefits  to  the  economy  as  a 
whole, providing revenue for airlines, as well as cost-effective services to companies 
that  depend  on  the  rapid  transport  of  their  goods  across  the  nation.  Just  as  its 
health boosts other industries, impediments to the health of air cargo have financial 
ripple effects felt across most, if not all, economic sectors. 

Security  is  among  the  most  vital  components  of  our  industry’s  health.  No  one  is 
more  committed  to  aviation  security  than  the  Airforwarders  Association  and  its 
members. The business of airforwarding is built around a guarantee to provide safe 
transportation of goods in a timely manner. Without a high priority on security, our 
ability  to  execute  those  goals  is  compromised,  harming  both  our  customers  and  our 
businesses.  This  constant  reminder  of  the  high-risk  environment  in  which  we  oper-
ate  has  taught  us  how  to  identify  potential  dangers  and  solutions  to  prevent  these 
problems from occurring. 

Our  relationship  with  TSA  and  DHS  has  shown  us  firsthand  the  value  of  a  col-
laborative, good faith atmosphere for strengthening air cargo security. Stricter regu-
lations on ‘‘known shipper’’ and increased oversight and inspection of cargo facilities 
have  imposed  burdens  on  the  air  cargo  industry  but  were  crafted  in  such  a  way  to 
include the concerns of airforwarders, creating realistic and effective regulations. By 
continuing  outreach  efforts  and  a  balanced  regulatory  approach,  we  are  confident 
Mr. Hawley will help advance both air cargo security as well as the economic secu-
rity of one of America’s most critical industries.
