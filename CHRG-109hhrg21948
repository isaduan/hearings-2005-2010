Small Business Innovation

Research: What Is the Optimal

Role of Venture Capital?

TUESDAY, JUNE 28, 2005

3:00 P.M.–5:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

PURPOSE:

On Tuesday, June 28, at 3:00 p.m. the House Science Committee’s Subcommittee
on Environment, Technology, and Standards will hold a hearing to review the Small
Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  program,  focusing  on  issues  associated  with
awarding SBIR grants to small businesses owned, or partly owned, by venture cap-
ital firms.
WITNESSES:
Panel I:
Representative  Sam  Graves  (R–MO),  sponsor  of  H.R.  2943,  the  Save  Bio-
technology  Innovative  Research  Act  of  2005,  introduced  on  June  16,  2005.  The  bill
would  allow  more  expansive  venture  capital  participation  in  small  businesses  eligi-
ble for SBIR awards.

Panel II:
Ms.  Ann  Eskesen,  President,  Innovation  Technology  Institute,  Swampscott,  MA.
The  Innovation  Technology  Institute  is  a  clearinghouse  for  information  on  SBIR
technology and outcomes and supports collaboration between technology companies.
Ms. Eskesen believes that venture capital is critical to technology development, but
that  SBIR  rules  should  not  be  significantly  changed  to  favor  venture  capital  firms.
Dr. Ron Cohen, CEO of Acorda Technologies, Hawthorne, NY. Acorda Technologies
is  a  small  biotechnology  company  that  develops  treatments  for  neurological  dis-
orders.  Dr.  Cohen  believes  that  venture  capital  investment  in  SBIR  companies
should not be restricted.
Mr. Jonathan Cohen, President and CEO, 20/20 Gene Systems, Rockville, MD. 20/
20  Gene  Systems  is  a  small  biotechnology  company  that  develops  diagnostic  meth-
ods and test kits with applications in drug development and testing, homeland secu-
rity,  and  disease  diagnosis.  Mr.  Cohen  believes  that  venture  capital  investment  in
SBIR companies should be limited.
Dr. Carol Nacy, CEO, Sequella Inc., Rockville, MD. Sequella develops diagnostics,
therapeutics,  and  vaccines  for  tuberculosis.  Dr.  Nacy  believes  that  venture  capital
investment in SBIR companies should not be restricted.
Dr.  Frederic  Abramson,  President  and  CEO  of  AlphaGenics,  Inc.  of  Rockville,
MD. AlphaGenics is a small biotechnology company that focuses on the interactions
between  nutrition,  metabolism,  human  development,  and  gene  expression.  Dr.
Abramson  believes  that  venture  capital  investment  in  SBIR  companies  should  be
limited.

OVERARCHING QUESTIONS:

Should companies that are majority-owned by venture capital firms be allowed to
compete  for  SBIR  awards?  If  such  a  change  were  made,  what  impact  would  it  be
likely to have on the SBIR program?

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

4

A  spirited  debate  is  underway  in  the  research  and  venture  capital  communities
on  whether  it  is  appropriate  for  SBIR  awards  to  be  given  to  small  companies  that
are majority-owned by venture capital (VC) companies.

On  December  3,  2004,  the  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA)  issued  a  final
rule  saying  that  to  be  eligible  for  an  SBIR  award,  an  entity  must  be  a  for-profit
business  at  least  51  percent  owned  and  controlled  by  one  or  more  U.S.  individuals,
or 51 percent owned and controlled by another small business owned and controlled
by  Americans.  Typically,  VC  firms  are  not  controlled  by  individuals,  but  rather  by
entities such as private and public pension funds, financial and insurance investors,
and endowments and foundations.

Also  on  December  3,  2004,  to  get  more  guidance  on  the  issue,  SBA  published  an
Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), seeking additional public comment
on  the  VC  issue.  In  particular,  SBA  is  seeking  comment  on  what  the  impact  of
maintaining  or  changing  the  current  rules  would  have  on  the  eligibility  and  com-
position  of  the  SBIR  applicant  pool,  which  firms  would  benefit  or  suffer  from  a
change,  and  whether  the  broader  participation  of  VC  firms  would  lead  to  multiple
award winners at the expense of innovation and diversity.

SBA  has  followed  up  the  ANPR  with  a  series  of  public  meetings  around  the
United  States  to  obtain  further  public  comment  on  the  role  of  VCs  in  SBIR.  These
meetings will continue through June 30, 2005. Meanwhile, identical bills1 have been
introduced in the House and the Senate to change the eligibility rules for SBIR. The
legislation  would  allow  a  firm  to  participate  in  SBIR  even  if  a  consortium  of  VC
firms  controlled  a  majority  stake  as  long  as  no  single  VC  firm  held  more  than  a
49 percent stake in the company. The legislation is supported by the Biotechnology
Industry Organization (BIO) and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA).
Proponents  of  changing  the  current  rule  argue  that  VC  firms  are  a  major  source
of  financing  in  certain  industries,  such  as  biotechnology,  and  that  VC  support  can
help  a  firm  continue  research  and  commercialize  products.  Opponents  contend  that
VC  firms  are  often  run  by  large  corporations.  Therefore,  opponents  argue,  small
businesses that are controlled by VC firms should not be seen as independent small
businesses in need of special research funding, but rather as arms of large corpora-
tions that do not merit SBIR support.
BACKGROUND:
The SBIR Program

SBIR was established in 1982 by the Small Business Innovation Development Act
[P.L. 97–219] to increase the participation of small, high technology firms in federal
research and development (R&D) activities. SBIR has been reauthorized twice since
its original enactment, and the current program authorization is scheduled to sunset
in  2008.  The  Science  Committee  and  the  Small  Business  Committee  share  jurisdic-
tion over the program in the House.

Under  SBIR,  departments  and  agencies  with  R&D  budgets  of  $100  million  or
more are required to set aside 2.5 percent of their R&D budgets to sponsor research
at  small  companies  through  the  SBIR  program.  Currently,  11  departments  and
agencies  sponsor  SBIR  programs:  the  Departments  of  Defense  (DOD),  Commerce,
Education,  Health  and  Human  Services,  Housing  and  Urban  Development,  Home-
land  Security,  Transportation,  Energy,  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Foun-
dation.

Each  agency  runs  its  own  SBIR  program,  emphasizing  research  areas  of  interest
to  the  particular  agency.  But  SBA  establishes  broad  policy  guidelines  for  the  SBIR
program.  SBA  monitors  program  implementation  and  reports  to  Congress  on  the
conduct of the separate departmental and agency activities.

Small  businesses  are  eligible  for  SBIR  awards  if  they  are  independently  owned
and  operated  for-profit  companies,  not  dominant  in  the  field  of  research  proposed,
and employ fewer than 500 people.

From  its  inception  in  1983  to  2003,  the  most  recent  year  for  which  reliable  is
available,  over  $15.2  billion  in  SBIR  awards  have  been  made  for  more  than  76,000
research  projects.  In  fiscal  year  2003,  SBIR  made  6,224  awards,  totaling  $1.66  bil-
lion.

The Venture Capital Issue

The  current  dispute  over  VC  funding  began  on  January  10,  2001,  when  the  SBA
Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  issued  a  ruling  against  the  majority  ownership  of
SBIR companies by VC firms. This ruling was based on the appeal of CBR Labora-
tories,  Inc.,  of  Boston,  Massachusetts,  to  the  rejection  of  its  application  for  SBIR
funding  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  CBR  Laboratories’  grant  application
had  been  rejected  because  a  VC  firm  held  a  controlling  interest  (i.e.,  more  than  51
percent  stake)  in  CBR  Laboratories.  The  ruling  made  by  the  Administrative  Law
Judge stated that VC firms were not ‘‘individuals,’’ i.e., ‘‘natural persons,’’ and there-
fore SBIR agencies could not give SBIR grants to companies in which VC firms had
a  controlling  interest.  The  biotechnology  and  VC  industries  were  dismayed  by  this
ruling,  seeing  it  as  a  new  interpretation  of  the  VC-small  business  relationship  by
SBA, which had treated VC firms as individuals up to this decision.
Advocates for Expanded VC Participation in SBIR-eligible Companies

The  biotechnology  industry  is  the  strongest  advocate  for  unrestricted  VC  affili-
ation  with  SBIR-funded  companies.  Advocates  argue  that  the  SBA  rule  at  best  cre-
ates a meaningless barrier to private-sector investment that inhibits growth of bud-
ding companies, and at worst blocks the translation of new discoveries into life-sav-
ing  products  for  numerous  fatal  diseases.  They  point  out  that  biotechnology  R&D
is  capital-intensive  and  the  involvement  of  VC  money  is  critical  to  bring  drugs
through  the  development  phase  to  market.  BIO  and  NVCA  have  taken  the  official
position that eligibility for SBIR awards should be expanded to include small compa-
nies that are majority owned by a consortium of VC firms.
Advocates for Limited VC in SBIR

However,  the  biotechnology  industry  is  not  entirely  united  in  its  opposition  to
SBA’s  policy.  Some  biotechnology  experts  and  company  representatives  argue  that,
if  SBA  regulations  allowed  more  VC-backed  companies  to  apply  for  SBIR  grants,
they  would  crowd  out  completely  independent  small  research  companies  run  or
owned  by  individuals.  They  also  point  out  that  SBIR-eligible  companies  are  cur-
rently  able  to  attract  VC  backing  without  giving  away  a  majority  stake,  and  there-
fore it is not necessary to expand the role of VC.

Beyond the biotechnology industry, some companies and small business advocates
point  out  that  many  large  companies,  such  as  Intel,  have  set  up  VC  funds  as  a
means of investing in, and ultimately buying promising new companies that develop
breakthrough technologies. They argue that if the Federal Government funded small
businesses  backed  by  such  VC  funds,  the  SBIR  program  could  end  up  subsidizing
the  acquisition  of  small  businesses  by  big  businesses.  This  position  is  held  by  the
Small Business Technology Coalition (SBTC), for example.
History and Background of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program

The  argument  for  the  SBIR  program  as  a  whole  was  that  while  universities  and
large  firms  could  compete  successfully  for  federal  research  and  development  con-
tracts  and  grants,  small  companies  were  at  a  disadvantage  in  spite  of  their  great
potential  to  contribute  to  the  Nation’s  science  base.  SBIR  was  designed  to  redress
this disadvantage.

In  2001,  the  most  recent  reauthorization  of  SBIR,  the  Small  Business  Reauthor-
ization Act [P.L. 106–554] required a study by the National Academy of Sciences re-
view  of  the  largest  SBIR  programs  to  find  out,  for  example,  if  SBIR  research  was
leading to new products in the marketplace. The Act also required SBA to establish
databases  of  SBIR  activity  to  help  track  and  assess  the  performance  of  the  SBIR
program, and encouraged SBIR agencies to do a better job of partnering with states.
The SBIR program is structured in three phases. Phase I awards (up to $100,000)
fund  research  projects  designed  to  evaluate  the  feasibility,  and  the  scientific  and
technical merit of an idea. Phase II awards (up to $750,000) provide additional fund-
ing  for  Phase  I  projects  that  have  demonstrated  potential  for  successful  develop-
ment. Phase III is a not formally funded by the Federal Government, although some
agencies  have  begun  experimenting  with  Phase  III  awards.  Phase  III  is  where  pri-
vate-sector  investment  and  support  is  supposed  to  step  in  and  bring  an  innovation
to  market.  However,  Phase  III  funds  may  include  follow-up  contracts  with  federal
agencies  for  the  production  of  Phase  II  innovations.  This  is  particularly  true  in  the
case of the Department of Defense.
SBIR Legislation in the 109th Congress

On  June  16,  2005,  Senator  Bond  and  Representative  Graves  introduced  identical
bills,  S.  1263  and  H.R.  2943,  the  Save  Biotechnology  Innovative  Research  Act  of
2005.

This  legislation  would  expand  eligibility  for  SBIR  awards  to  include  small  busi-
nesses  that  are  majority  owned  by  a  consortium  of  VC  firms  as  long  as  no  one  VC
firm  held  a  majority  stake.  The  legislation  further  would  require  that,  for  a  small
company  to  remain  eligible,  the  participating  VC  firm  cannot  be  owned  by  a  large
company.  The  legislation  would  allow  start-up  companies  (defined  as  companies
with  sales  of  less  than  $3  million,  and  no  positive  cash  flow  from  operations)  to  be
eligible  for  SBIR  no  matter  how  large  a  stake  a  VC  firm  controlled  in  them.  The
legislation has been endorsed by BIO and the NVCA.
Issues Raised in GAO Reports on SBIR

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued a number of reports over
the years that assess various aspects of SBIR. The following are the more significant
issues that GAO has highlighted:
• Commercialization Rates

In 1991, GAO gave SBIR a generally favorable review, stating that SBIR ‘‘clearly
is  doing  what  Congress  asked  it  to  do  in  achieving  commercial  sales  and  develop-
mental  funding  from  the  private  sector.’’  GAO  reported  that  an  SBA  study  found
that approximately one in four SBIR projects resulted in the sale of new commercial
products  or  processes.  GAO  issued  another  report  in  1992  in  which  it  addressed
Phase  III  activity,  saying  that  although  not  enough  time  had  elapsed  since  the  be-
ginning  of  the  program  for  SBIR  projects  to  fully  mature,  it  appeared  that  SBIR
projects  were  obtaining  Phase  III  funding  (an  indicator  of  commercialization  poten-
tial),  with  commercial  activity  totaling  $1.1  billion  in  sales  since  the  beginning  of
the program.

• Multiple Award Winners

In  1999,  GAO  testified  before  the  House  Science  Subcommittee  on  Technology,
summarizing  the  findings  of  its  report  on  SBIR.  In  this  testimony,  GAO  reported
that  the  25  most  frequent  winners  of  SBIR  grants,  representing  less  that  one  per-
cent  of  the  companies  in  the  program,  received  about  11  percent  of  the  program’s
awards, totaling $900 million over 14 years. GAO did note that one-third of winning
applicants  during  a  five-year  period  from  1993–1997  were  first-time  applicants,  an
average  of  750  a  year,  which  indicated  that  the  program  was  not  stagnating.  What
GAO  focused  most  on,  however,  was  the  lack  of  consistent  methods  to  define  and
track commercialization and thus evaluate the SBIR program’s success, and the rec-
ognition  of  the  fact  that  commercialization  a)  meant  different  things  to  different
agencies  and  b)  was  not  always  consistent  with  the  mission  of  the  agency  in  ques-
tion.

In  its  1992  report,  GAO  noted  that  companies  that  received  multiple  Phase  II
grants  appeared  to  have  lower  Phase  III-related  sales  and  private-sector  funding
than did those companies with lower numbers of Phase II awards. In addition indi-
vidual  companies  have  occasionally  complained  that  there  are  companies  that  only
do  research  but  are  not  significantly  involved  in  commercializing  research  results,
and are thus dependent on SBIR Phase II grants to remain operational. These firms
have  been  given  the  moniker  ‘‘SBIR  mills.’’  SBIR  mills  do  not  appear  to  be  a  wide-
spread  phenomenon,  but  because  of  the  lack  of  a  uniform  reporting,  tracking,  and
analytical  process  for  SBIR,  it  is  impossible  for  program  managers  or  anyone  else
to assess their true extent.

• Geographical Diversity

SBIR  grants  are  heavily  concentrated  (about  40  percent  of  the  total  funding)  in
the states of California, Massachusetts, Virginia, Maryland, and New York, and this
distribution  has  not  changed  significantly  over  time.  Some  critics  have  said  that
these  concentrations  are  unfair  and  that  SBIR  managers  should  do  a  better  job  of
distributing  their  awards  geographically,  and  recruiting  promising  companies  in
under-served  areas.  Others  argue  that  the  distribution  of  SBIR  simply  reflects
where  clusters  of  research  intensive  companies  are  located.  For  example,  Maryland
receives  significant  amounts  of  SBIR  funding  because  of  the  biotechnology  compa-
nies clustered around the National Institutes of Health. SBA has an outreach office
to publicize the SBIR program in under-served areas.

QUESTION FOR THE WITNESSES:

All of the witnesses were asked the following question:
In  your  testimony,  please  summarize  your  views  on  the  Small  Business  Innova-

tion and Research (SBIR) program, and answer the following question:

1. How  should  venture  capital  ownership  of  small  companies  be  treated  in  the

consideration of SBIR applications?

Chairman EHLERS. Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s hear-
ing, entitled ‘‘Small Business Innovation Research: What Is the Op-
timal Role of Venture Capital?’’

I  thank  my  colleague,  Congressman  Baird,  for  suggesting  that

the Subcommittee examine this important and timely issue.

The  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  Program,  known  as
SBIR,  was  created  by  Congress  in  1982  to  increase  the  participa-
tion of small technology firms in federal research and development
activities.

Federal  departments  and  agencies  with  R&D  budgets  of  $100
million  or  more  are  required  to  set  aside  2.5  percent  of  their  R&D
funding  to  sponsor  research  of  small  companies  through  the  SBIR
program.  These  departments  include  the  Department  of  Defense,
the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation,
as  well  as  smaller  agencies,  such  as  the  National  Institute  of
Standards  and  Technology.  From  1983  through  2003,  more  than
$15  billion  has  been  awarded  to  small  companies  for  about  76,000
projects.  In  2003  alone,  more  than  $1.6  billion  was  awarded  to
small  companies  for  6,200  projects.  These  figures  are  surprising  to
most, including Members of Congress who do not closely follow the
program.

The program has been reauthorized twice since its inception, and
the  current  authorization  is  set  to  expire  in  2008.  While  there  are
many aspects of the program that warrant further review, as Con-
gress  prepares  to  reauthorize  SBIR,  the  specific  issue  we  wish  to
discuss today is the role of venture capital in the small businesses
that receive SBIR grants. For the past several years, this issue has
been  a  hot  topic  for  debate.  The  Small  Business  Administration,
which sets the underlying rules of the program, has issued rulings
that some interpret to limit the participation in SBIR of small busi-
nesses  that  are  largely  owned  by  venture  capital  firms.  For  small
businesses  in  some  industries,  such  as  biotechnology,  which  gen-
erally  have  significant  venture  capital  involvement,  these  rulings
have  caused  great  concern.  Other  small  companies  believe  there
should be limits on outside ownership for those companies wanting
to participate in the SBIR program.

This  is  a  complicated  issue,  and  one  which  deserves  to  be  aired.
I  am  looking  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses.  I  am  pleased
to welcome our Ranking Member, and I apologize for starting with-
out you, Mr. Ranking Member, but I was assured by your colleague
here that it would be all right, and your timing was impeccable, so
I am now pleased to recognize you for an opening statement.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN VERNON J. EHLERS

Good afternoon and welcome to today’s hearing, entitled ‘‘Small Business Innova-

I  thank  my  colleague,  Congressman  Baird,  for  suggesting  that  the  Subcommittee

tional  Science  Foundation,  as  well  as  smaller  agencies  such  as  the  National  Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology.

From  1983  through  2003,  more  than  $15  billion  has  been  awarded  to  small  com-
panies for about 76,000 projects. In 2003 alone, more than $1.6 billion was awarded

been  reauthorized  twice  since  its  inception  and  the  current  authorization  is  set  to
expire in 2008.

While there are many aspects of the program that warrant further review as Con-
gress  prepares  to  reauthorize  SBIR,  the  specific  issue  we  wish  to  discuss  today  is
the role of venture capital in the small businesses that receive SBIR grants. For the

For  small  businesses  in  some  industries,  such  as  biotechnology,  which  generally
have  significant  venture  capital  involvement,  these  rulings  have  caused  great  con-
cern. Other small companies believe there should be limits on outside ownership for
those companies wanting to participate in the SBIR program.

This is a complicated issue, and one which deserves to be aired. I am looking for-

ward to hearing from our witnesses.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  Optimal  use  of
time  is  very,  very  important,  and  I  want  to  join  you  in  welcoming
folks to this afternoon’s hearing.

The  SBIR  program  is  the  largest  federal  program  to  support  the
development  of  new  technologies.  For  the  last  fiscal  year  in  which
we  have  accurate  numbers,  in  2003,  a  total  of  almost  $1.7  billion,
and this compares to $44.5 million in awards made in the first year
of  its  operation,  way  back  in  1982,  and  my  understanding  is  that
this fiscal year, we are going to be close to the $2 billion mark.

Last  year,  at  home  in  Oregon,  we  had  a  roundtable  focusing  on
SBIR and the Advanced Technology Program, and I can attest that
in  Oregon,  there  is  very,  very  strong  interest  in  both  SBIR  and
ATP,  and  a  group  of  vibrant  high-tech  startup  companies  in  part
depend  upon  the  competitive  availability  of  these  programs.  And  I
have  become  increasingly  aware  of  the  difficulties  that  some  of
these  organizations  have  in  bringing  their  research  ideas  to  proof-
of-concept.

Today,  we  are  going  to  focus  on  one  SBIR  issue,  and  that  is  the
appropriate role of venture capital, or VC firms, who may invest in
small high-tech businesses, and we have a panel of witnesses later
on  who  will  be  presenting  their  views  on  this  issue.  I  would  like
to  recognize  the  leadership  and  work  of  my  colleague  from  South-
west Washington, Congressman Brian Baird, for bringing this issue
to  this  committee’s  attention  through  his  work  about  12  months
ago, as I recall.

And before I close, I would like to say that I hope the committee
will conduct a thorough review of the SBIR program before it sun-
sets in 2008. The core goals of the program have not changed much
since its inception in 1982. The business environment and the sup-
port  infrastructure,  the  financial  support  infrastructure,  of  our
business  community,  especially  the  high-tech  community,  has
changed  substantially  in  the  last  two  decades  plus,  and  it  is  this
committee’s responsibility to ensure that the SBIR and other early
public finance programs supports the high-tech small business sec-
tor while promoting U.S. economic competitiveness. And I look for-
ward  to  the  insight  of  Mr.  Graves  and  our  other  witnesses  today.

Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  yield  back  the  balance
of  my  time.  Would  my  colleague  from  Washington  like  to  make  a
statement?

[The prepared statement Mr. Wu follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DAVID WU

I want to join Chairman Ehlers in welcoming everyone to this afternoon’s hearing.
The  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  Program  is  the  largest  federal
program to support the development of new technologies. SBIR awards in 2003 total
almost  $1.7  billion—this  compares  to  the  $44.5  million  in  awards  made  in  the  first
year  of  it’s  operation.  It  is  doubtful  that  anyone  would  have  been  able  to  forecast
the size and scope of this program back in 1982.

Last  year  I  sponsored  a  roundtable  in  my  district  focusing  on  programs  such  as
the SBIR and the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). In Oregon we have a group
of vibrant high-tech start-up companies. I wanted to make them aware of opportuni-
ties  for  support.  I  am  also  aware  of  the  difficulties  they  have  in  bringing  research
ideas  to  proof-of-concept,  the  so-called  ‘‘valley  of  death’’  and  the  need  to  create  a
bridge across this gap.

Today we are going to learn about one current SBIR issue, that is, the appropriate
role  of  venture  capital  firms  who  invest  in  small  high-tech.  businesses.  We  have  a
balanced panel of witnesses who will present their views on this issue. I would like
to add that we shouldn’t discount either the role of venture capital or the SBIR pro-
gram  in  supporting  the  development  of  new  technologies  in  the  U.S.  As  Congress
begins  to  focus  on  this  issue,  today’s  hearing  will  provide  us  some  guidance.  I  also
want to thank my colleague and neighbor, Rep. Baird for bringing this issue to the
Committee’s attention.

Before I close, I would like to say that I hope the Committee will conduct a thor-
ough review of the SBIR program before it sunsets in 2008. The fundamental goals
of the program have not changed much since its inception 1982. However, few could
argue that the economic and business climate have changed considerably since then.
It  is  this  committee’s  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  program  supports  the  high-
tech  small  business  sector  while  promoting  U.S.  economic  competitiveness.  I  hope
our witnesses will have some insight on this issue as well.

Chairman  EHLERS.  I  am  pleased  to  recognize  Mr.  Baird  for  an

opening statement.

Mr. BAIRD. I thank my distinguished Ranking Member and good
friend from across the Columbia River. Thanks for your leadership
on this, Representative Wu, and with our mutual high-tech compa-
nies, this is obviously important.

Chairman  Ehlers,  thank  you,  again,  for  once  again,  you  have
looked  ahead  to  a  problem,  and  we  appreciate  the  leadership  on
that,  and  the  time  on  this  issue.  I  want  to  commend  Mr.  Graves
for  his  work  on  this  and  his  legislation.  We  have  been  working  at
this bill for some time, with this issue, and I am proud to be a co-
sponsor of your bill.

In  essence,  we  believe  in  the  SBIR  program.  We  would  like,  in
some  ways,  to  expand  it.  Possibly—personally,  I  think  it  might  be
expanded in terms of who is eligible for it. At the same time, there
are some concerns that have been raised about whether or not the
money  invested  in  SBIR  always  leads  to  products  that  can  be  of
use. And so, I hope today that we can explore both of those issues,
how  we  might  make  SBIR  funds  more  available  to  effective  and
successful  companies,  and  how  we  might  observe  areas  in  which
SBIR moneys might not be used as effectively as they may be, and
I  look  forward  to  today’s  hearing,  and  thank,  again,  the  Ranking
Member and the Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN BAIRD

I  would  first  like  to  thank  Chairman  Boehlert  and  the  distinguished  Chairman
and  Ranking  Member  of  this  subcommittee  for  working  with  me  to  schedule  a  dis-
cussion  on  the  topic  of  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  program.  I  would
like  to  thank  the  panelists  for  their  attendance  today  and  valuable  insight,  and
thank  Mr.  Graves  for  his  leadership  on  this  issue.  I  am  an  original  co-sponsor  of
his bill, the Save Biotechnology Innovative Research Act of 2005, and I look forward
to continuing to work with him.

Venture capital (VC) investment has become increasingly important and, in some
cases,  a  necessity  for  many  small  businesses  interested  in  producing  new  tech-
nologies  and  products.  However,  it  is  my  hope  that  we  can  also  spend  time  today
exploring some broader aspects of the program in an effort to improve this vital pro-
gram  so  that  we  can  begin  to  understand  the  extent  to  which  this  program  truly
meets  the  intent  of  the  original  legislation—to  encourage  small  business  to  explore
their  technological  potential  and  provides  the  incentive  to  profit  from  its  commer-
cialization.

The  recent  restrictions  the  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA)  placed  on  ven-
ture capital-backed companies participating in the SBIR program was brought to my
attention  by  constituents  of  mine,  a  small,  privately-held  company  called  nLight.
They  manufacturer  high-power  semiconductor  diode  lasers  and  are  supported,  in
part,  by  four  venture  capital  firms.  They  have  been  impacted  by  the  SBA’s  rule  to
restrict  VC-backed  small  businesses  from  competing  for  SBIR  grants,  and  are  no
longer able to participate in this competitive process.

The  SBIR  program  is  an  approximately  $2  billion  technology  development  pro-
gram aimed at small business. This makes it the single largest technology develop-
ment  program  supported  by  the  Federal  Government.  It  is  my  view  that  the  SBA’s
new  rule  creates  a  barrier  to  private-sector  investment  and  inhibits  the  growth  of
start-up  companies  as  well  as  commercialization.  It  has  become  incompatible  with
the original intent of the law.

I  look  forward  to  the  discussion  today  and  hearing  both  sides  of  the  issue.  It  is
my  hope  that  in  exploring  the  role  that  venture  capital  plays  in  the  SBIR  program
we may also touch upon ways in which we can improve it to meet the original intent
of Congress.

Chairman EHLERS. If there is no objection, all additional opening
statements submitted by the Subcommittee Members will be added
to the record. Without objection, so ordered.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Honda follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

Chairman  Ehlers  and  Ranking  Member  Wu,  thank  you  for  holding  this  hearing

today and for allowing me to participate.

This issue is very important to me, because so many of the companies in my dis-
trict  either  are  small  start-ups  or  have  grown  up  from  the  start-up  stage  to  what
they are today. The ones that made the transition successfully relied on a combina-
tion of factors, including hard work, good ideas, perhaps fortunate timing, and fund-
ing.

The sources of that funding can be many, such as angel investors, venture capital,
and  government  grants  and  contracts  from  the  local,  federal,  or  State  level.  Some-
times  more  than  one  of  those  sources  are  needed,  especially  at  the  early  stages.  In
many cases, venture capital investors are unable to accept the level of risk inherent
in  investing  in  an  early  stage  company.  Another  source  of  funding,  such  as  govern-
ment funding through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, can
help to reduce the level of risk these investors feel.

Unfortunately,  the  way  the  law  is  currently  being  interpreted,  companies  that
have  received  venture  capital  funding  are  no  longer  eligible  to  compete  for  and  re-
ceive  SBIR  awards.  I  think  this  is  a  flawed  interpretation  of  the  law,  and  have  co-
sponsored legislation to restore the SBIR eligibility of start-up venture backed firms.
I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  thoughts  of  the  witnesses  on  this  matter,  and  on
other  changes  that  might  be  made  to  the  SBIR  program  to  help  it  achieve  its  goal
of  bringing  the  results  of  basic  research  to  technological  and  commercial  maturity.

Panel I

Chairman  EHLERS.  At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  introduce  our

first witness, Congressman Sam Graves from Missouri.

Mr. GRAVES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  EHLERS.  Mr.  Graves  is  a  valued  Member  of  the  Con-
gress,  and  I  serve  with  him  on  the  Transportation  Infrastructure
Committee,  where  he  contributes  a  great  deal.  I  especially  admire
him,  because  he  is  doing  what  I  used  to  do,  and  don’t  have  either
the time or money for now, and that is flying airplanes. He is also
a firearms expert. If you combine those two, maybe that is why he
is  so  good  at  shooting  down  silly  ideas  that  float  around  here  once
in a while.

We are pleased to welcome you. Mr. Graves has introduced legis-
lation  regarding  the  involvement  of  venture  capital  in  the  SBIR
program,  and  obviously  knows  a  great  deal  about  this  issue,  as
does Mr. Baird. Congressman Graves.

STATEMENT OF HON. SAM GRAVES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN

CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MISSOURI

Mr.  GRAVES.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  Ranking  Member,  Con-
gressman Baird. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today before
your  subcommittee  on  the  vital  need  to  protect  small  businesses
backed by venture capital.

As  Chairman  of  the  House  Small  Business  Subcommittee  on
Rural  Enterprise,  Agriculture,  and  Technology,  I  know  the  impor-
tance  of  venture  capital  to  small  businesses,  particularly  small
biotech  companies,  and  I  appreciate  you  holding  this  hearing,  and
bringing this issue even further into the light.

Venture  capital  funding  is  critical  to  small  biotech  companies.
They  provide  the  needed  seed  money  to  help  get  some  of  these  in-
novative  ideas  off  the  ground  and  running.  Without  this  invest-
ment, given the nature of the biotech industry, I think it would be
very  difficult  to  finance  this  process.  These  small  businesses  are
providing  the  country  with  the  ideas  and  the  innovation  that  has
become  the  identity  of  the  United  States.  Without  these  thoughts
and  ideas,  the  United  States,  I  believe,  will  fall  behind  the  rest  of
the  world  in  innovations  and  breakthroughs.  Unfortunately,  these
small  companies  and  venture  capitalists  are  being  blocked  out  of
the promising investment, investment that is needed in rural com-
munities all across the United States.

The  Small  Business  Innovation  and  Research  program,  or  SBIR,
as  you  all  referred  to,  this  program  is  obviously  a  federal  program
administered by the SBA. The program allocates a specific percent-
age of all federal research and development grant moneys to small
business applicants. This program allows for cutting edge research
that  may  not,  in  its  earliest  stages,  attract  funding  from  other
sources.

Eligibility requirements to SBIR are murky at best. According to
the  SBA,  to  be  eligible  for  a  grant,  a  small  company  must  be  at
least  51  percent  owned  by  one  or  more  individuals.  For  a  while,
this requirement gave the small businesses backed by venture cap-
ital  access  to  this  critical  seed  money.  However,  the  SBA  recently
ruled  that  ‘‘individuals’’  would  exclude  investment  by  venture  cap-

12

ital. This rule change resulted in the disqualification of many small
biotech  firms  engaged  in  promising  research  towards  tomorrow’s
cures.

As you know, and as was pointed out, I recently introduced H.R.
2943,  the  Save  America’s  Biotechnology  Innovation  Research  Act  of
2005. Specifically, this bill will allow small, venture capital-backed
companies to be eligible for the SBIR program, as long as no single
venture  capital  fund  has  a  majority  interest  in  the  company,  and
the fund is not owned by a large firm.

This  legislation  is  larger  than  that,  however.  Not  only  does  H.R.
2943  restore  small  business  access  to  this  essential  program,  but
it also further encourages venture capitalists to provide critical in-
vestment in the future of this country. It is the research that these
companies  are  doing  that  leads  to  technological  innovations,  keep-
ing the U.S. at the forefront of discovery.

Mr. Chairman, it is imperative that venture capital-backed small
businesses are not blocked out of the SBIR program. Small biotech
companies  are  unique  in  that  it  costs  millions  of  dollars  just  to
begin  research.  These  companies  rely  greatly  on  both  venture  cap-
ital  and  the  SBIR  program.  It  is  this  combination  of  funding  that
will  lead  to  advancements  in  fighting  things  like  cancer,  diabetes,
and other research in many other fields.

Mr. Chairman, again I want to thank you for allowing me the op-
portunity  to  discuss  this  issue  before  your  committee,  and  I  com-
mend your efforts, and I would like to offer my continued participa-
tion  in  any  future  action  that  your  committee  take,  or  your  Mem-
bers  may  take  in  helping  small  business.  I  think  it  is  crucial.  I
think it is important in these particular areas, and again, I do ap-
preciate the opportunity to testify.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Graves follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CONGRESSMAN SAM GRAVES

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to testify before this Subcommittee on
the  vital  need  to  protect  small  businesses  backed  by  venture  capital.  As  Chairman
of  the  House  Small  Business  Subcommittee  on  Rural  Enterprise,  Agriculture,  and
Technology  I  know  the  importance  of  venture  capital  to  small  businesses,  particu-
larly small biotech companies. I appreciate you holding this hearing.

The  Small  Business  Innovation  and  Research  (SBIR)  program  is  a  federal  pro-

ture capital-backed companies to be eligible for the SBIR program as long as no sin-
gle  venture  capital  fund  has  a  majority  interest  in  the  company,  and  the  fund  is
not owned by a large firm.

But  this  legislation  is  larger  than  that.  Not  only  does  H.R.  2943  restore  small
business  access  to  this  essential  program,  but  also  it  further  encourages  venture
capitalists  to  provide  critical  investment  in  the  future  of  this  country.  It  is  the  re-
search that these companies are doing that leads to technological innovations, keep-
ing the U.S. at the forefront of discovery.

Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  imperative  that  venture  capital-backed  small  businesses  are
not  locked  out  of  the  SBIR  program.  Small  biotech  companies  are  unique  in  that
it  costs  millions  of  dollars  just  to  begin  research.  These  companies  rely  greatly  on
both  venture  capital,  and  the  SBIR  program.  It  is  this  combination  of  funding  that
will lead to advancements in fighting cancer, diabetes, and research in other fields.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to discuss this issue
before  your  committee  and  I  commend  your  efforts.  I  would  like  to  offer  my  con-
tinuing  participation  in  any  future  actions  you  may  take  to  help  small  businesses.
Chairman  EHLERS.  I  thank  you  very  much  for  your  testimony,
Congressman,  and  we  will  certainly  be  pursuing  this  issue  in  the
months  ahead.  So  as  you  know,  it  is  customary  that  we  do  not
allow  questions  of  fellow  Congresspersons,  because  we  all  have
time  to  question  you  afterwards,  and  so  we  will,  with  that,  excuse
you.

Mr.  GRAVES.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  please,  anything  I  can

do to help, I would love to.

Chairman EHLERS. Thank you. We appreciate that.

Panel II:

Chairman  EHLERS.  Next,  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  next  set
of  witnesses.  If  they  would  take  their  places  at  the  witness  table,
please.

Our first witness is Ms. Ann Eskesen, who is President of the In-
novation Development Institute, located in Swampscott, Massachu-
setts.  Interesting  name.  Dr.  Ron  Cohen  is  President  and  CEO  of
Acorda  Therapeutics,  Incorporated,  located  in  Hawthorne,  New
York.  Mr.  Jonathan  Cohen  is  President  and  CEO  of  20/20  Gene
Systems,  Incorporated,  located  in  Rockville,  Maryland.  Dr.  Carol
Nacy  is  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Sequella,  Incorporated,  located
in  Rockville,  Maryland.  And  finally,  Dr.  Frederic  Abramson  is
President  and  CEO  of  AlphaGenics,  Incorporated,  located  in  Rock-
ville, Maryland.

We  have  a  good  representation  here  from  Rockville.  I  hope  at
some point we hear from the rest of the country, too. The witnesses
should  know,  and  should  have  been  told,  spoken  testimony  is  lim-
ited  to  five  minutes  each,  after  which  the  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee will then have five minutes each to ask questions of you.

We  will  start  with  Ms.  Eskesen.  Would  you  please  turn  on  your
microphone? Just push the button. Push it again, or pull it toward
you. Push it again. It is still not on.
STATEMENT OF MS. ANN ESKESEN, PRESIDENT, INNOVATION
DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE, SWAMPSCOTT, MASSACHUSETTS
Ms.  ESKESEN.  This  has  been  a  highly  divisive  issue,  that  has
been ongoing for well over two years now, and one of the most star-
tling  things  is  that  it  has  proceeded  without  anybody  bothering  to
actually look at the extent and form of venture capital involvement
in the SBIR program.

I have been invited to provide that information. My name is Ann
Eskesen.  I  was  part  of  that  small  group  who  were  involved  in  the
original  development  and  passage  of  SBIR,  and  I  have  been  there
for  just  about  every  fight  that  there  has  been  since.  I  don’t  have
any  answers  today,  and  I  might  comment  that  most  of  what  I  am
going to say is going to upset everybody on both sides of this issue,
but in order to be able to do what I do, I have been systematically
keeping  the  SBIR  record.  I  can  tell  you  exactly  how  much  money
has been awarded to whom, for what, by when, and what has hap-
pened  to  it.  I  can  also  tell  you  a  great  deal  about  the  companies
who were involved, and in my written testimony, there is consider-
able detail of the type of information we compile on the companies
that have been SBIR involved.

The  reason  I  was  invited  here  today,  I  am  sure,  is  that  I  also
keep  exquisitely  detailed  information  on  VC  activity  within  the
SBIR  program.  As  of  today,  there  have  been  precisely  1,083  firms
who have been in receipt of SBIR funding, and also have been ven-
ture  capital  funded.  But  before  I  get  into  the  detail  of  what  that
all  means  when  you  look  at  the  information,  I  want  to  underscore
and to stress the point that was made in the introductory remarks
of  what  SBIR  is.  It  is  not  a  small  business  program.  I  don’t  think
it  was  ever  intended  to  be  a  small  business  program.  It  is  fun-
damentally a program that is designed to support the development
of new technologies. Those new technologies are fundamental to the
health and well-being of an industrialized economy.

What  has  happened  as  a  result  of  the  SBIR  participation  over
this  time,  and  I  should  tell  you,  as  of  last  Friday,  we  have  in  this
company,  in  this  situation,  invested  a  hair  under  $19  billion.  But
one  of  the  consequences  of  this  activity  has  been  to  create,  within
SBIR, the largest single concentration of technical talent anywhere
in  the  United  States.  We  exceed  by  a  factor  of  300  percent  all  of
the  engineers  and  scientists  who  are  employed  by  all  of  the  aca-
demic  institutions  in  the  United  States  added  together.  We  are
issuing patents at the rate of one every three hours, which is com-
parable  to  that  which  is  being  achieved  by  some  of  the  major  cor-
porations in the United States. We now have 47,000 issued patents
in the United States in the SBIR community.

In  order  to  be  able  to  realize  the  value  that  is  created  in  that
enormous range of technical assets, a different set of resources are
required  to  those  of,  specifically,  SBIR.  And  for  those  firms  which
present  the  profile  of  being  centered  towards  large  markets,  with
an  opportunity  for  a  liquidity  event  in  a  reasonable  time  frame-
work,  that  other  resource  is  venture  capital.  As  of  this  point,  over
the life of the program, just over seven percent of all SBIR award-
ees have been VC funded. That is nine percent, if you look at com-
panies  more  recently  funded.  And  if  you  extract  out  those  compa-
nies  who  are  doing  what  we  would  consider  to  be  leading  edge
work, you are probably looking at between 18 and 20 percent of all
SBIR involved companies are VC funded.

What is very interesting is that this is not a recent phenomenon.
In fact, if you look into my written testimony, we have documented
by  year  and  by  agency  the  number  of  awards  made  to  VC  funded
firms over the entire life of the program since 1983. Averaging out
over  all  the  agencies,  that  factors  to  between  18  and  20  percent  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

15

all  awards  ever  made  in  the  SBIR  program  have  been  made  to
companies who are VC funded.

Significantly,  perhaps,  given  the  emphasis  of  today’s  effort,  the
largest  concentration  of  that  activity  is  in  the  National  Institutes
of  Health,  where  after  a  slow  start  in  ’83  and  ’84,  we  have  settled
into  a  situation  where  between  20  and  25  percent  of  all  dollars
awarded  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  are  awarded  to  com-
panies who either are or will become VC funded.

VC  is  extremely  valuable  to  an  SBIR  company.  It  has  the  effect
of  allowing  the  company  to  bring  the  technology  that  they  have
under  development  much  further  along  in  the  development  cycle
before  they  need  to  apply  for  SBIR  dollars,  and  in  my  testimony,
I have given you indication of when companies are, in fact, getting
their SBIR dollars.

What  I  want  to  concentrate  on  in  the  few  minutes  I  have,  is  to
look at why the VC community been so interested in being involved
in  the  SBIR  program?  All  of  the  reasons  offered  by  those,  most  of
those opposing the current effort to try and extend VC involvement
in  SBIR  fund,  turn  out  to  be  actually  inaccurate.  The  number  of
the  proportionate  size  of  the  award  pool  for  the  venture  capital
community  is  absolutely  consistent  with  the  number  of  companies
that are involved.

More  recently,  the  assumption  has  been  that  after  the  collapse
of the markets in 2001, that VC funded companies have been flock-
ing  to  the  SBIR  program  in  order  to  be  able  to  get  funding  from
that  source.  Well,  it  turns  out,  in  fact,  that  the  extent  of  VC  in-
volved  companies  in  SBIR  has  actually  gone  down.  We  are  now
looking  at  a  situation  where  a  significantly  smaller  percentage  of
the companies that are SBIR involved are VC funded.

If you add up all of the money that has been invested by the ven-
ture  capital  community  in  the  SBIR  firms,  it  factors  out  to  about
$20 billion. If you add up in total all of the SBIR dollars that have
been  received  by  those  funded  companies,  it  comes  out  to  $2.5  bil-
lion. That negative ratio of ten venture capital dollars for one SBIR
dollar is probably a surprise—it certainly was to us—to—but it cer-
tainly  is  a  surprise  to  most  people.  And  it  poses  the  very  obvious
question, why are the venture capital community trying to hang on
and  expand  the  extent  and  form  of  their  SBIR  involvement,  when
all  they  have  to  do  is  to  just  drop  a  bit  more  money,  10  percent
more,  into  the  companies  who  are  venture  capital  SBIR  funded.
And if you understand why the VC firms are so interested in SBIR,
I think the entire discussion that we have been having for the last
two years shifts radically in focus.

And  what  I  have  done  in  my  testimony  is  walked  you  through,
on page 10, what we have, how we have tried to make a determina-
tion  of  that  interest  of  the  VC  community.  There  have  been,  since
2001,  607  firms  who  have  been  both  VC  funded  and  SBIR  funded.
The  investment  by  the  VC  community  in  that  population  is
$1,566,768,635.50. Obviously, I am joking about the $0.50. But the
SBIR  investment  in  those  companies,  I  am  sorry,  I  have  got  these
numbers  the  wrong  way  around.  The  $15  billion  is  what  the  VC
companies have invested, and $1.5 billion has come from the SBIR
program.  If  you  look  at  what  has  been  happening  to  those  compa-
nies,  the  answer  for  why  VCs  are  so  interested  becomes  very  obvi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

ous. Of those 607 firms, 208, 28 have achieved some form of liquid-
ity event, 211 have gone public, 41 have been acquired, and a cou-
ple  have  gone  belly-up,  and  so  on.  If  you  calculate  the  value  of
those  companies,  i.e.,  what  the  market  has  said  the  value  of  those
companies is, it comes out to somewhere between $45 and $50 bil-
lion.  For  an  investment  by  the  VC  community  of  $4.5  billion,  and
an investment by SBIR of $790,639,970.

What  I  think,  if  you  think  about  it,  this  statistic  demonstrates
is  what  is  the  most  important  thing  about  SBIR,  and  that  is  it  is
a  wealth/value  creator.  For  the  VC  community,  it  enables  them  to
identify  and  to  validate  the  overall  competency  of  a  potential  in-
vestment.  It  allows  them  to  mitigate  and  to  reduce  the  technology
risk on the project, and on a whole lot of other things, too, and po-
tentially, it increases significantly the value of the investment that
they have made. What it comes down to is that——
Chairman EHLERS. Could I ask you to wrap it up?
Ms.  ESKESEN.  Sorry,  sir.  What  I  am  trying  to  get  to  in  the  body
of  my  testimony  is  that  we  need  to  understand  why  the  venture
community  are  interested,  and  we  find  that  it  is  because  of  the
achieved  valuation.  What  I  think  what  that  leads  me  finally  into
is a couple of general comments about the fact that the VC commu-
nity  itself  has  changed  radically,  and  the  circumstances  in  which
they operate have similarly changed radically, and most definitely,
that has occurred in the biotech community.

So, my final comments have to do with, if you look at companies
like  Biogen  and  Genzyme,  who  were,  in  their  early  days,  SBIR  in-
volved,  they  were  startup,  early  stage  companies,  who  were  VC
funded shortly after their startup condition. They were also income/
revenue generating quite early. They were selling the picks and the
shovels  and  the  tools,  fee  for  service,  to  the  pharmaceutical  indus-
try.  It  was  comparatively  easy,  given  a  revenue  stream,  for  them
to be perceived as good investments, and they were brought to pub-
lic offering.

Post that period, we now have a circumstance where the biotech
firms  have  become  drug  discovery  companies,  and  none  of  their
revenues are now in place. They are, in fact, in most cases, depend-
ent upon being able to make some sort of liquidity event occur after
clinical trials have occurred. What happens, effectively, is this com-
pany is now valued. It took you a lot more money, and a lot longer
time  to  get  you  there.  And  so  what  I  find  myself  saying  is  that  I
think  that  the  VC  community  have  been  enormous  beneficiaries  of
the  SBIR  program,  and  I  have  laid  out  in  a  lot  more  detail  in  my
testimony why that is. Venture capital is extremely important, but
just  as  important  is  the  SBIR  program  to  the  VC  community,  and
I  think  there  are  a  number  of  questions  that  have  to  be  posed  to
the  VC  community  as  to  why  we  should  justify  opening  the  doors
to  a  continuing  access  to  SBIR  funding,  when  the  major  bene-
ficiaries  of  that  continuing  access  are,  in  fact,  the  VC  community
themselves.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Eskesen follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANN ESKESEN

First let me say that I appreciate the opportunity to offer my perspectives on this
complex but important issue of venture capital ownership in firms participant in the
federal  SBIR  program.  The  often  rancorous  ‘discussion’—now  almost  two  years  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

17

duration—surrounding this issue has been distracting and highly divisive across the
SBIR  community  and  outside,  almost  to  the  point  of  being  destructive.  Certainly  it
is the case that the effort and resources expended could have been far more produc-
tively utilized on issues of greater consequence to the future of SBIR.

Of  major  concern  to  me  has  been  that  this  entire  effort  seems  to  have  proceeded
with remarkably little reference to any systematically compiled, topic-relevant infor-
mation  about  the  actual  form  and  extent  of  VC-funded  companies  activity  in  SBIR.
Small sample surveys of firms which have been encouraged to believe that they will
be adversely affected; forums in which participants speak but do not listen; and an-
ecdotal  accountings  in  the  media  by  carefully  selected  firms  of  anticipated  adverse
impact  on  them  of  a  decision  one  way  or  the  other  has  generated  a  great  deal  of
heat. . .but  has  done  almost  nothing  to  persuade  either  side  of  the  validity  of  the
other’s position. The result is almost total impasse with efforts now to force resolu-
tion  legislatively  in  a  manner  that  will  probably  will  not  only  not  solve  the  under-
lying problem, but could well have ramifications with potential seriously to damage
the integrity of SBIR program longer-term.

I  do  not  claim  in  any  way  here  to  have  ‘‘The  Answer.’’  However,  I  am  probably
better  placed  than  most  to  provide  useful  and  relevant  large  volume,  analytical
data—I am sure that being the reason I was invited here today. Before proceeding,
I  should  note  that  in  the  process  of  setting  out  my  observations  and  conclusions  I
will  almost  certainly  upset  many  of  the  parties  on  both  sides  of  this  issue.  Those
who  are  firm  in  the  rightness  of  their  cause  will  likely  remain  unconvinced,  if  they
are listening at all. However, the far larger number who understand the compelling
need to find appropriate resolution to this divisive issue and to get back to business
will  hopefully  be  open  to  some  shifting  in  the  focus  of  discussion  that  my  analysis
may suggest.

Good afternoon: My name is Ann Eskesen. I am the founding President of the In-
novation  Development  Institute,  Swampscott,  MA.  I  was  among  that  small  group—
others are here today—involved in development and passage of the enabling legisla-
tion  for  this  important  small-business  program  in  1980–82.  To  a  greater  or  lesser
extent, I have been involved in the three reauthorizations since, and in most of the
SBIR–STTR crises, controversies and confrontations through the years. At the time
of  initial  development,  the  concept  of  SBIR  was  highly  controversial  and,  for  some,
to  an  extent  has  remained  so.  Following  passage  of  the  enabling  legislation  it  was
my decision, therefore, to stay involved to monitor program implementation.1

1 I should say that it was never my intent that SBIR advocacy would become my primary pro-
fessional  activity  these  many  years—advocates  generally  don’t  get  paid  and  we  have  been  no
exception.

18

To  function  in  that  capacity,  from  the  very  earliest  days  I  have  systematically

kept the SBIR record.

This  process  began  simply  by  tracking  in  a  single  data  base  the  detail  of  every
SBIR  award—by  funding  agency,  recipient  small  firm,  Principal  Investigator,  rel-
evant dates, project title, Technical Abstract, dollar amount(s), Phase II conversion,
etc.  Through  the  years  that  awards  monitoring  process  has  continued  and  our
SBIR–STTR  data  is  complete  and  accurate  to  announced  awards  of  recent  weeks.

Over  the  last  several  years  we  have  extended  our  efforts  also  carefully  to  track
various aspects of the firms which have been/are SBIR-involved. These data now in-
clude:

• Basic  business  information—current  name(s),  location  and  contact  infor-
mation;2 founding  date,  current  employment,  revenue  stream,  etc.;  and  a
Business Identifier and Profile.

• Various business activity data to include:

Æ Issued patents (domestic  and  international)  along  with,  usefully,  a full
patent citation index. Almost 47,000 U.S. patents have to date issued
to SBIR involved firms.

2 Simply  to  maintain  the  currency  of  names  and  addresses  is  a  very  demanding  task  in  itself
since  this  is  a  highly  mobile  group  which  seemed  to  have  a  great  propensity  for  changing  their
name(s) as well as their location.

19

Æ All Merger and Acquisition activity—so far 619 transactions.
Æ Public  offerings,  daily  stock  price  and  other  relevant  trading  infor-
mation  on  those  550  firms  and  aspects  of  their  various  SEC  filings.
Æ Various  Collaborative activities—in  and  out  licensing,  subcontracting,

joint ventures, etc.

To  allow  us  better  to  identify  and  track  their  technical  competencies,  other  areas
of data compilation which have more recently been added and are in various stages
of development include:

Æ Several sophisticated business and technical classification systems;
Æ Compilation  of  a  Full  Capability  Statements—with  a  primary  empha-
sis on the 4800–5000 firms doing what we would consider leading-edge
work;

Æ Biographies on all Principal Investigators and company principals;
Æ Professional papers and referencing articles;
Æ Along with a systematic listing of all Recognition Awards.

Using  a  sophisticated  relational  database  system,  all  these  elements  are  indexed
and  fully  integrated.  Elegant,  proprietary  tools  have  been  developed  enabling  some
extremely  interesting  and  often  quite  complex  analyses  across  the  entirety  of  the
SBIR program3 or within any selected subset.

Perhaps most useful and important to today’s topic, we also compile on a system-

atic basis:

• the  extent  and  form  of  Venture  Capital4 activity  involving  SBIR  firms  to
include  a  detailed  tracking  of  outcomes—commonly  referred  to  as  liquidity
events.

It  is  useful  to  note  that  our  data  in  this  category  for  more  recent  years  (2001–
present) is compiled such that, to some extent, we are able to set the SBIR VC expe-
rience  in  the  context  of  all  venture  capital  activity  in  United  States.  It  is  primarily
from  this  part  of  our  databases  that  I  have  drawn  for  the  analysis  undertaken  for
discussion here.

3 It is worth noting that in many important respects SBIR reflects—is a mirror for—important
changes in the larger economic environment: in effect, a living lab that could function as a pow-
erful  and  exciting  analytical  tool  in  its  own  right.  To  argue  for  SBIR  as  a  causative  agent  is
probably not appropriate. Certainly, however, the evidence is strong that effective SBIR partici-
pation is positioning a important percentage of SBIR-involved firms to take business advantage
of new opportunities that those changes are creating with major positive impact on the economy
overall.

4 It  is  important  to  note  what  our  VC  data  does  and  does  NOT  contain.  We  know  how  much,
from whom, on what date and what stage—seed, Series, round, etc. It is not a matter of public
record and we do NOT know on any systematic basis the prepaid for that investment—the per-
centage ownership.

Before proceeding to my analysis proper, let me first speak briefly to where SBIR
came  from:  what,  in  my  judgment,  was  both  the  basis  for  advocacy  for  SBIR  and
the Congressional intent.
Why did Congress establish SBIR?

At  the  time  of  passage  of  the  SBIR  enabling  legislation,  this  country  was  in  the
throes of recession. Unemployment rates were high, quality (read: high-paying) jobs
were  moving  offshore,  the  cost  and  availability  of  capital  were  issues  (particularly
early-stage,  high-risk)  and  many  of  our  major  industries  were  under  competitive
strain.  It  was  broadly  understood  then,  as  it  is  now,  that  economic  viability  and
growth regionally and nationally is anchored primarily in effective technology de-
velopment—using  what  we  know.  There  was  compelling  evidence  from  a  range  of
studies that small firms were a prolific and cost-effective source of that technological
innovation.  Add  in  the  fact  that  small  firms  had  been  recently  shown  to  be  the
economy’s  primary  job  creator  and  the  context  for  passage  of  the  SBIR  enabling
legislation was set.

This  intentionally  stresses  the  fact  that  passage  of  SBIR  was  fundamentally
grounded  in  the  notion  of  the  program  as  a  technological,  business  and  eco-
nomic  development  resource.  The  proposed  investment—as  noted  above  now  20
years later approaching $19 billion—was not because these firms were small or de-
serving.  It  was  because  this  population  included  some  of  the  Nation’s  best  and
brightest  minds—persons  at  the  time,  and  who  had  over  an  extended  time  period
previously,  been  largely  excluded  from  access  to  federal  R&D  support.  Providing
them  that  access,  it  was  argued,  was  key  to  improving  their  potential for impor-
tant economic impact.

The evidence that SBIR has already delivered in major ways to that early promise
is compelling. Though this is probably the place, this is not the time to present that
evidence.  However,  one  factor  clearly  bears  mentioning.  Beginning  in  the  late
eighties/early  nineties,  the  structure  of  U.S.  Labor  Markets  has  undergone  a  major
shift.  Who  the  technically  trained  now  work  for  in  this  country  has  changed  radi-
cally.

Our  compiled  SBIR  employment  and  biography  data  suggests  that  some  400,000
graduate  engineers  and  scientists  now  work  for  SBIR-involved  firms.  Using
NSF’s  data  on  university  employment  as  the  comparative  index,  that  means  that
the  number  of  SBIR–STTR  employed  scientists  and  engineers  today  factors  to  al-
most three times as many as all those in U.S. academic institutions. In other words,
the  SBIR  community  now  the  largest  single  concentration  of  technical  talent
in the United States. By itself, this is a quite remarkable and hugely important re-
turn on the SBIR investment that has been made. This is a concentration of talent
that—if  we  are  as  a  nation  to  compete  effectively  in  the  global  economy—it  is  vital
that we not only retain and but also enhance.

As  evidence  of  that  concentration  of  technology  development  capacity,  SBIR  com-
panies  are  now  issuing  patents  at  a  rate  comparable  to  the  most  prolific  of  the
major corporations—one patent approximately every three to four hours—for a total
now  in  excess  of  47,000.  That  rate  far  exceeds  that  of  academic  institutions,  and
SBIR  firms  also  are  achieving  a  rate  of  patent  citation—often  used  as  an  indicator
of patent importance—that is substantial.
Realizing that value:

Critical  to  this  current  debate  is  to  understand  that  to  realize  the  value  of  that
created  asset  base  requires  more  than  SBIR  funding.  This  program  is  designed  to
support  the  high  risk,  early  stage  research  and  development  of  creative  new  ideas.
The all-important transition of those ideas which show promise to some appropriate
type  of  use-condition—completion,  if  you  like,  of  the  innovation  process—requires  a
different set of resources and, it should be added, often also demands a very different
set of skills.5

5 Not  central  to  this  discussion  but  critical  to  the  continued  effective  functioning  of  the  SBIR
program is how we deal with the fact that a major percentage of those firms doing what would
seriously  be  considered  leading-edge  work—about  4800–5000  of  them  over  the  life  of  the  pro-
gram;  about  2500–2800  currently—lack  the  requisite  skills  and  access  to  the  resources  which
are needed to bring their technologies to use-condition.

Facilitating that access is probably not the answer. The problem is more
structural.  SBIR  awardees  are  component,  not  full-systems  builders.  The
market—public and private—demand whole product. To require our guys
to  assemble  all  those  other  elements  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  market
is  an  unrealistic  and  inappropriate  use  of  their  capabilities.  The  real
SBIR challenge, in my judgment, is not the current VC eligibility debate,
but rather how effectively to draw down on the wealth of what has been
created.

For  that  subset  of  SBIR–STTR  Awardees  addressing  potentially  large  markets
and  offering  the  likelihood  of  some  form  of  liquidity  event  (i.e.,  an  IPO  or  acquisi-
tion), among those ‘‘other resources’’ is frequently Venture Capital.

1083  VC  Funded  SBIR–STTR  Awardees:  The  number  of  SBIR  firms  to  have

been in receipt of venture funding has now reached 1083: That represents

• 7.08 percent of all SBIR funded companies over the life of the program.

• Among  those  more  recently  SBIR-involved—2001–2005—that  percentage6 of

firms that are VC funded has actually increased to 9.36 percent.

Factoring  only  to  firms  doing  leading-edge  work—some  4800–5000  overall  (about
2500–2800  currently)—that  percentage  is  even  higher:  perhaps  as  much  as  15–20
percent.

6 As  an  important  and  useful  indicator  of  the  extent  of  VC  previous  and  current  interest  in
SBIR, it is worth noting that these percentages are far larger than in any random group of small
technology-based  firms.  There  is  substantial  evidence  from  the  work  of  others  as  well  as  our
own to suggest that SBIR participation significantly increases the likelihood that the small firm
which presents the appropriate VC required profile (large market and the prospect of a liquidity
event)  will  attract  that  often  important  support.  Though  I  cannot  document  the  fact  with  cer-
tainty at this point, that seems to be even more the case for those firms located in States which
are less well VC endowed.

Over the life of the program, SBIR has proven a valuable and important resource

both

• to many of the firms funded by the venture capital community
• and, critically, to many of the VCs who have made those investments.

Not a recent phenomenon:

Though  I  suspect  not  intentionally,  discussion  around  the  eligibility  issue  has
largely  proceeded  as  if  VC  SBIR  involvement  is  a  new  trend:  that  fall-out  from
dot.coms,  post-2001  market  conditions  having  shut  off  liquidity  events  and  reduced
(and  still  reducing)  achieved  ROIs  on  their  portfolios  has  caused  these  VC  funds  to
look  elsewhere  to  leverage  on  their  available  dollars.  I  would  suggest  this
misperception  has  actually  served  to  skew  the  discussion.  In  fact,  VC  involvement
in SBIR is

• neither a recent condition,
• nor is it limited to any one agency.

As  part  of  the  analysis  for  this  hearing,  we  backtracked  the  awards  record  of
every  SBIR  VC  funded  awardee  by  year  and  agency.  The  Chart  and  Table  below
shows clearly that VC funded firms have been an important percentage of SBIR ac-
tivity  from  the  onset  of  the  program.  Beginning  less  than  a  year  or  so  into  program
activity, the pattern of participation has been consistent. In the aggregate across the
agencies, 10–12 percent of awards made have involved firms also been in receipt of
venture capital at some stage in their business development.

Perhaps significantly in the context of recent events, by far the largest percentage
all  of  SBIR  dollars  taken  by  VC-funded  companies  has  been  in  the  National  Insti-
tutes of Health. By the late ’80s, the number of awards made to firms in NIH which
either  already  were,  or  subsequently  became,  VC  supported  entities  had  settled
around the range of 20–25 percent of all their awards.

Though somewhat lower in totals, NSF has similarly consistently made a substan-
tial  percentage  of  awards  to  venture  capital  funded  firms.  In  fact  some  important
level  of  SBIR  VC  funding  activity  can  be  found  in  every  one  of  the  participating
SBIR agencies, even the very smallest.

Value of SBIR to VC-eligible firms:

Effective  use  of  SBIR  may  often  permit  a  small  firm  to  hold  off  on  the  time  at
which  they  need  to  raise  external  dollars  and/or  to  reduce  proportionately  the
amount  they  need  initially  to  raise.  Note  that  though  use  of  SBIR  award  dollars  to
open  the  doors  has  dropped  significantly  in  the  period  2001–2005  (from  26.05  per-
cent to 11.09 percent), the percentage of those taking their first award(s) in the next
one-two  year  period  has  increased.  Examination  of  a  cross-section  of  the  start-up
records of these firms suggests that SBIR award dollars are being used to bring onto
the  professional  staff7 people  whom  they  probably  could  not  otherwise  afford—part
of that start-up making the transition towards being a viable business and a hugely
important pre-VC, risk-reduction process.

7 Development of the original SBIR regulations were specifically crafted to support this condi-
tion. At the time of applications, whom a potential PI works for is not an issue. The commitment
must  be  that  at  the  time  of  award,  that  PI  must  join  the  recipient  small  firms  for  more  than
five percent of their time.

Rarely, if ever, are VC firms in the picture at that time.
Particularly for Awardees in states which are reasonably well VC-endowed,8 being
effectively  SBIR-involved  seems  to  serve  quite  well  to  lower  the  high-risk  profile
that the small firm presents and, therefore, proportionately may actually reduce the
price they have to ‘pay’ for that money, i.e., they must give up less of the firm.
Value of SBIR to the VC:

Analysis of our data suggests that the type of SBIR value that is of high-inter-
est and importance to the VC Community is almost certainly NOT that which many
who are opposed to any form of eligibility rule-change for majority VC-owned, SBIR-
involved  firms  assume  it  to  be.  Most  of  that  oppositional  discussion  seems  to  have
organized around one or more of several basic points:

• That  VCs  want  access  to  the  funding  dollars  that  SBIR  provides  as  a  useful

supplement to/substitution for their own investment.

• That VC funded firms are effectively ‘siphoning off’ of these dollars when they
already  have  so  much  more  money  available  to  them,  this  argument  con-
tinues, is an inappropriate use of SBIR support.

• A  widely-held  view  (probably  not  valid)  is  that  the  fact  that  VC  supported
firms  are  already  well-funded  gives  them  competitive  advantage  in  the
awards process.

• That  the  SBIR-involvement  of  VC  funded  firms  is  tilting  the  program  unfa-
vorably  towards  the  better  endowed,  limiting  the  access  of  more  deserving,
earlier stage firms.

In fact, the data shows clearly these assumptions are fundamentally in error. See

Table following.s

8 For SBIR-involved firms in less well VC endowed states, this risk reducing, better price fac-
tor  seems  to  be  far  less  evident.  The  relative  lack  of  options  (competition)  for  the  deals  puts
growth  oriented  firms  in  these  states  at  an  immediate  disadvantage.  Just  as—perhaps  even
more  important—is  the  serious  shortage  in  those  states  of  professional  service  providers  with
the requisite skills and direct experience to negotiate to an appropriate price.

• The extent of SBIR dollars taken by VC-funded firms individually9 is signifi-
cantly less than I think most people are assuming. Collectively totaling ‘only’
about  $2.6B  over  the  life  of  the  program  this  amount  is  substantial,  but  en-
tirely proportional to the number of firms involved.

• A  common  assumption  made  by  opponents  to  the  pressure  to  achieve  special
treatment  of  VC  funded  firms  is  that  the  numbers  of  awards  and  dollars
taken  by  VC  funded  firms  having  ramped  up  since  the  Stock  Market
downturns  of  2001  onwards.  In  fact,  the  number  of  awards  per  VC  funded
firm has actually gone down.10

The SBIR awards rate to VC-funded firms is now only slightly higher than to non-
VC  funded.  Over  the  earlier  period  of  SBIR  activity—1983–2000—the  average
awards totals achieved by VC funded firms was significantly higher to than to non-

9 Separate,  but  connected  to  this  VC  issue,  is  that  relating  to  the  number  of  very  large  SBIR
Phase  I  (and  Phase  II)  awards  which  have  been  made,  especially  in  the  National  Institutes  of
Health.  Of  the  12  Phase  I  awards  made  in  a  dollar  amount  of  $750K  or  more  (three  at  over
$1M), not one involved a VC funded firm.

10 The  suggestion  that  proponents  for  size-eligibility  rule  change  will  almost  certainly  make
here that this drop-off is because VC funded firms are no longer applying for SBIR award and/
or  are  being  rejected  as  ineligible  actually  does  not  fit  the  facts.  This  reduction  in  per-award
participation actually pre-dates by at least a couple of years the current controversy.

VC  funded:  6.70  percent  versus  3.83  percent.  It  now  stands  at  3.58  percent  per  to
3.03 percent to the non-VC funded.

We  know  who  got  VC  funding  and  can  document  the  detail  of  how  much  VC  has
been invested in SBIR-involved firms to date to a total of slightly over $12B. Invest-
ment  made  in  the  years  prior  to  1998  are  less  complete  in  their  detail  in  our  data-
bases  but  we  estimate  these  factor  to  about  another  $5–7B.  That  suggests  a  total
VC investment in SBIR involved firms to date of about $20B.

• By  far  the  most  telling  point  made  by  analysis  of  the  VC  SBIR  track  record,
however,  is  that  the  amount  of  VC  investment  made  in  SBIR-involved  firms
far  and  away  exceeds  anything  that  they  are  receiving  from  SBIR  awards  as
such—see chart below.

For  every  ONE  Dollar  received  by  the  VC  funded  firm  in  SBIR  Awards,  TEN  in-

vestment dollars have been recorded.

This negative-ratio finding of SBIR to Investment dollars was a surprise to
us initially and, I suspect, will be an entirely unexpected finding to just about every-
one  who  has  been  part  of  this  two-year  controversy  on  either  side  or—as  many
Members of Congress and their staffs have been—who have been caught in the mid-
dle.

In  fact,  given  this  highly  unexpected  finding,  the  very  obvious  question  which

must addressed in he context of this overall discussion becomes:

If  the  amount  that  VC  funded  firms  are  getting  from  their  SBIR  participation  is
proportionately so small, one might well ask—why haven’t/don’t the VCs simply put
in  a  few  extra  dollars  into  the  SBIR–STTR  firms  in  their  portfolio  and  just  avoid
all this current hassle?

27

In  effect,  to  find  resolution  to  the  current  impasse  demands  that  we  understand

why SBIR–STTR has been, and continues to be, valuable to the VC community.

A useful way here to find probable answer to this important question can be dem-

onstrated by our walking through the set of Powerpoint slides provided below.

This set of slides examines in some detail those 607 VC funded firms which have
been  SBIR  program  involved  since  early  in  2001;  and  the  achieved  liquidity  event
of 228 of those firms.

SBIR is about value/wealth creation:

In  effect,  what  this  analysis  shows  is  at  the  very  core  of  why  SBIR  overall
is  such  a  powerful  and  important  program  not  only  specifically  for  those  who
invest in SBIR-involved firms, but for the economy overall. Effective SBIR participa-
tion is fundamentally about value-creation.

A fundamental premise of the VC endeavor is that a quality investment with sig-
nificant potential return is one in which an earlier injection of the right sort of cash
will have a multiplier effect. In this instance, for many VC funds, SBIR is that ‘right
sort  of  cash’.  With  no  dilution  in  investor’s  ownership  in  the  firm,  SBIR  supports
can serve well

• at  least  at  some  level  to  validate  the  overall  competency  of  the  potential

28

To an important extent, this condition of value creation is a characteristic of
all those firms in SBIR which we judge to be doing leading edge work. The
option available to firms which present the appropriate VC profile (high growth and
liquidity  event)—and  that  is  largely  missing  for  the  more  general  SBIR  Awardees—
is a way of being able to draw down on that created value—an IPO or MA& event.

This  is  not,  I  would  strongly  suggest,  a  task  that  should  be  left,  as  it  is  now,  al-

most entirely to the initiative of individual awardees. It is just too important.

To  their  credit  (and  their  achieved  benefit),  many  in  the  VC  community  I  would
argue, have early recognized this value-added condition of SBIR. By being so exten-
sively  involved  in  SBIR  from  the  beginning,  these  VCs  have  been  doing  their  job—
to provide a quality return on funds raised from the own investors.

The  challenge  presented  by  the  current  debate  is  to  consider  the  extent  to  which
we  permit  use  of  SBIR  support  to  increase  the  potential  for  that  financial
return to those investors?

It  has  taken  me  a  long  time—both  here  and  in  analysis  of  these  data  over  these

many months—to get to the point where I think we can demonstrate how to

• move away from the largely corrosive discussion of how to provide/prevent an
across-the-board  eligibility  rule-change  that  would  treat  all  VC-funded  SBIR-
involved  firms  as  a  single  group—clearly  a  completely  unacceptable  condition
• and  proceed  instead  to  a  discussion  which  considers  the  two  critical  issues

which are at the heart of this issue:

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

29

The essence of my contribution to this debate is that—in my judgment

• it is entirely inappropriate that we permit the present discussion to continue
as  if  all  VC-funded  SBIR  firms  are  at  the  same  stage  of  development  and
should  be  treated  such  that  the  same  rules  apply  to  all.  To  open  the  door  to
the  potential  of  ever-lasting  SBIR  participation  regardless  of  the  state  and
stage of the firm involved is not acceptable.
• Just  as  unacceptable,  however,  is  the  notion  that  we  should  in  any  way  im-
pede  the  full  and  effective  SBIR  participation  by  those  VC  funded  firms
which, by any other criteria, would more commonly be judged ‘small business’.

These two findings are neither contradictory nor mutually exclusive.
To  operationalize  these  findings,  I  would  suggest,  will  require  the  institution  of
1. Some mechanism which would enable a level of segmentation of the VC-fund-

ed SBIR-involved firms.

a. The  obviously  ineligible  are  fairly  evident—actually  quite  a  small  num-

ber.

b. Just as evident are the firms which are clearly not (yet) in that ineligible

pool.

The  challenge  is  to  craft  the  rules  to  handle  that  two-three  dozen  firms
which fall in the mid-range.

2. A set of rules appropriate to define SBIR graduation. This is a concept which
has  already  been  broached  but  more  usually  with  reference  to  the  so-called
‘‘proposal mills.’’ 11

Overall, it would be my assertion that this mechanism of differentiation probably
should  not  be  so  much  by  age  and  size  of  the  firm  as  by  stage  of  development  of
the  project.  In  effect,  let  us  consider  allowing  use  of  SBIR  to  sweeten  the  deal—al-
lowing qualified firms to undertake higher-risk, earlier-stage work which might well
not otherwise get done. This is a classic role assumed through the years by the Fed-
eral  Government.  Later  stage,  pre-market  development  work  is  more  appropriately
funded by private sources.

Some final general observations:

• Venture capital:

There  are  few  who  would  argue  the  critical  importance  of  venture  capital  to  the
effective  development  of  a  technology,  innovation-based  economy.  The  fact  that  al-
most  every  other  industrialized  and  industrializing  economy  seeks  to  emulate  the
U.S.  VC  model  (and  the  SBIR  program)  speaks  to  that  fact.  However,  U.S.  venture
capital  today  is  quite  distinctly  different  from  the  industry  in  its  early  days,  and
has  changed  in  many  important  ways  even  since  the  mid  to  late  ’90s.  Those
changes12 manifest in how, from whom—and how much—VC funds are raised; what
type of investments are being made and at what stage of development; at what dol-
lar levels; how return on investment is realized; and with what achieved ROI.

In  effect,  it  is  my  considered  opinion  that  it  is  critically  important  that  that  per-
centage of SBIR involved firms who are addressing substantial markets and
growth  opportunities  as  their  firm  develops  should  not  be  excluded  from
SBIR  participation.  This  population  currently  represent  something  in  excess  of
nine  percent  of  all  currently  active,  SBIR-involved  firms;  a  significantly  larger  per-
centage of that population of companies which our analysis suggests are doing lead-
ing-edge work.

To disallow the participation of these firms at the appropriate point in their devel-
opment  could  seriously  weaken  the  overall  viability  and  effectiveness  of  the  SBIR

11 Based my considerable SBIR experience through the years, I would suggest that this peren-
nial  accusation  is  pure  myth  and  fiction,  entirely  without  basis  in  fact  and  should  be  finally
eliminated from any serious SBIR discussion.

12 Though  not  directly  the  subject  of  today’s  hearing,  it  could  be  argued  that  modern  VC  has
many of the characteristics of a maturing industry with all of the implications of that condition.

program  as  a  business  and  economic  development  resource.  Growth-oriented,  small
firms  requires  substantial  access  to  capital  far  in  excess  of  any  that  could  be—and
has been—provided by the SBIR program and, critically, is of a quite different type.
The adverse consequences of putting any serious impediment in the way of their ac-
cess to this type of capital could have major economic-impact repercussions

• Current SBIR eligibility rules may need a tweak but wholesale redefi-
nition  of  those  rules  in  not  necessary.  It  ain’t  broke;  we  don’t  need
to fix it:

As  a  longtime  SBIR  advocate,  it  has  been  my  considered  opinion  throughout  the
life  of  the  program  that  the  rules  pertaining  to  SBIR  participation  and  eligibility
should  not  be  changed  to  accommodate  to  the  special  needs  of  any  sub-set  of  other-
wise SBIR-qualified small firms. This would include any special dispensation for ge-
ographic distribution, particular industry segment and, in this case, firms in receipt
of external equity investment.

A  basic  premise  from  which  SBIR  has  proceeded  from  the  outset  has  been  that
the  only  criteria  by  which  selection  for  award  should  be  judged  are  the  competency
of the firm involved and the technical validity of the project submitted. This funda-
mental premise has maintained the integrity of the SBIR program over now twenty-
two years.

It  would  be  my  judgment  that  to  set  aside  size  eligibility  requirements,  particu-
larly  when  the  reasons  for  that  need  are  entirely  external  to  the  SBIR  program,  is
a dangerous precedent to set. If a special dispensation for majority-owned VC fund-
ed firms is permitted, who will be the next group for whom exception must be made?

III  Ventures  (P3V)—targeted  specifically  to  realizing  the  created  value  in  SBIR-in-
volved  small  firms.  Involving  several  major  corporations  and  others  with  extensive
financial  interest  in  SBIR  awardees,  the  P3V  effort  is  anchored  in  the  most  com-
prehensive,  complete  and  in-depth  databases  developed  by  idi,  documenting  the
technology  competencies  and  intellectual  assets  of  SBIR  awardees—at  this  point
over 15,000 firms.

Ms. Eskesen has close working relationships with the various players in the SBIR
community  ranging  from  relative  new-comers  to  the  long-time  involved  awardees.
She works closely with the principals in a range of State SBIR–STTR Support orga-
nization to make more effective the form and extent of SBIR–STTR participation in
their  geographic  regions.  Her  detailed  understanding  of  how  SBIR–STTR  reflects
what is going on in the larger economic environment bring many invitations to work

with senior players in major corporations, the federal agencies, etc. She is often fea-
tured as the keynote speaker at technology and economic development events.

Through  the  years  Ms.  Eskesen  has  served  on  the  boards  of  several  technology
development  organizations.  A  skilled  and  informed  analyst,  she  has  also  worked
with  a  range  of  organizations  regionally,  nationally  and  internationally  which  are
engaged in encouraging the growth of small technology based companies.

Extensively involved with a small group of others in passage and subsequent im-
plementation of the original SBIR enabling legislation in 1982, Ms. Eskesen has tes-
tified  frequently  before  Congressional  committees  of  matters  of  consequence  to  the
SBIR  community.  She  was  the  leading  advocate  in  1986  for  the  first  SBIR  re-au-
thorization;  was  extensively  involved  in  drafting  the  1992  re-authorization  legisla-
tion which continued, expanded and modified this important small business resource
and  was  a  key  player  in  development  and  implementation  of  strategies  to  achieve
final  passage  well  in  advance  of  sunset.  Through  the  years,  her  knowledge,  efforts
and  counsel  have  been  key  in  almost  every  situation  in  which  effective  functioning
of SBIR has required support from political attack through agency management de-
cisions.  Currently,  her  major  focus  is  finding  appropriate  resolution  to  the  highly
contentious issue of SBIR participation of VC funded firms.

STATEMENT OF DR. RON COHEN, PRESIDENT AND CEO,

ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Dr.  RON COHEN.  Thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to
present today. I am Ron Cohen. I am a Board-certified doctor of in-
ternal  medicine,  and  founder  and  CEO  of  Acorda  Therapeutics,
which  is  a  small,  privately  held,  venture  backed  biotech  firm  in
Hawthorne,  New  York.  Prior  to  founding  Acorda  10  years  ago  in
1995,  I  was  part  of  the  startup  team  of  another  biotech  company,
which  eventually  we  took  public,  which  dealt  with  growing  skin
and liver and other tissues for transplantation.

The  mission  of  Acorda  is  to  develop  and  bring  to  market  thera-
pies that restore neurological function to people with spinal cord in-
juries, multiple sclerosis, and related conditions that damage or af-
fect  the  nervous  system.  Currently,  my  company  has  a  drug  prod-
uct  in—we  have  just  begun  a  Phase  III  clinical  trial,  the  final
stage,  which  we  hope  will  finally  prove  efficacy  of  a  drug  that  re-
stores  the  walking  ability  and  strength  in  people  with  multiple
sclerosis.

In addition, we have a small, about a dozen dedicated scientists,
who  are  working  on  bringing  other  therapies  to  the  clinic,  notably
a  protein  therapy  that  has  shown  in  animal  models  the  ability  to
grow  new  nerve  connections  in  animals  with  spinal  cord  injuries
and  various  brain  injuries,  and  to  restore  various  functions  in  an
unprecedented  manner,  including  walking,  bladder  function,  and
visual  function.  We  are  also  working  on  therapies  to  repair  the
nerves  that  have  lost  their  insulation  in  people  with  multiple  scle-
rosis.

All  of  these  are  quite  promising.  We  are  doing  all  this  with  59
employees,  which  I  believe  would  be  considered  a  small  company
under  any  rational  standard.  For  the  first  four  years  of  our  com-
pany’s  existence,  I  worked  out  of  my  second  bedroom,  and  then,  a
sublet  office  of  a  friend.  I  took  no  salary,  and  so  this  was  a  classic
entrepreneurial story. Since we were able to raise our first venture
capital  round  in  1998,  we  have  raised  approximately  $132  million
in venture capital, plus another $8 million in grants and corporate
partnerships.

I  currently  have  35  venture  capitalists  who  have  seen  fit  to  in-
vest  in  my  company.  The  biggest  single  owner  among  them  owns
10 percent of the company, and the others own five percent or less
apiece.  I  believe,  therefore,  that  in  the  19  years  I  have  been  in
biotech, I have a reasonable perspective on what makes our indus-
try  go,  what  makes  it  successful,  and  the  role  of  the  venture  capi-
talist  in  it,  as  well  as  SBIR  grants,  of  which  my  firm  has  been
awarded several over its lifetime.

I  believe  there  is  a  fundamental  misunderstanding  afoot  about
the  proper  role  of  VCs,  and  also,  an  erroneous  attempt  to  equate
VC  ownership  with  big  company  ownership.  The  two  notions  are
extremely  distinct.  Venture  capital  is  simply  a  pooling  of  funds
from scores, hundreds, or even thousands of individuals to form an
efficient  way  of  allocating  that  capital  for  investing  in  high  risk,
high  reward  propositions.  The  SBIR  grant  program  has  proved  to
be an essential gap filler in the progress of technology from the sci-
entist’s bench to the patient’s bedside, or to product.

Because  there  is  an  early  stage  of  technology,  particularly  in
biotech, where it takes 10 to 15 years to bring a product from idea
to market, if at all successful, there is an initial gap where the idea
is  there,  the  technology  may  be  partly  formed,  but  it  is  too  early
for  a  venture  capitalist  to  invest,  because  it  is  too  high  risk.  Now,
venture  capitalists  take  very  high  risks  in  biotech.  For  250  prod-
ucts  that  enter  clinical  trials,  only  one,  on  average,  will  emerge  as
a  successful  therapy.  So,  even  if  venture  capitalists  were  to  invest
only  in  clinical  stage  products,  they  are  still  taking  a  huge  risk.
The fact is, they invest in preclinical products, too, but there is that
window that requires other funding to create proof-of-principle and
direction for the venture capitalist.

That  is  the  window  that  the  SBIR  program  fulfills,  and  if  I  had
not been able to get SBIR and also an ATP grant early on, my com-
pany  would  not  be  here  today.  Our  therapy  for  MS  would  not  be
in  Phase  III  trials,  and  we  would  not  have  these  promising  other
therapies  in  our  pipeline,  absolutely.  Indeed,  if  one  looks  at  the
SBIR  program,  to  get  a  Phase  II  grant,  which  is  where  you  begin
to  get  substantial  funds,  a  million  dollars  or  two,  rather  than  the
Phase  I  grants,  which  are  about  $100,000  to  $200,000,  one  of  the
requirements  is  that  the  recipient  have  proved  the  ability  to  raise
private  funding.  And  so,  in  many  ways,  the  current  interpretation
is  at  odds  with  the  actual  operation  of  the  Phase  I  and  Phase  II
program.

To  exclude  venture  backed  companies,  therefore,  is  to  exclude
companies that have actually proved themselves to be the most ef-
ficient  at  developing  products,  because  the  venture  capitalists  hire
the  best  physicians,  the  best  scientists,  the  best  patent  attorneys,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

33

to review each company’s business. And those that pass that grade
are  the  ones  that  get  invested  in.  The  SBIR  grants  allow  competi-
tive,  smart  entrepreneurs  and  scientists  to  bring  their  products  to
the point where they can run the gauntlet of VC due diligence suc-
cessfully.

If this interpretation currently is to stand, it will chill our indus-
try.  We  have  already  seen  a  survey  from  the  Biotech  Industry  Or-
ganizations showing that over half of the companies that previously
have  been  applying  for  SBIR  grants  are  no  longer  applying,  as  a
result of this interpretation. I have heard personally from directors
of  various  divisions  at  the  NIH  that  the  quality  of  grant  applica-
tions  for  SBIR  is  now  going  down,  because  of  this  chilling  effect.
So there are fewer grants, and perversely, the very companies that
are  the  most  competitive  are  the  ones  who  are  no  longer  applying
and getting these grants, where the government’s return on invest-
ment, as it were, would be expected to be the highest.

So  in  summary,  the  SBIR  grant  has  played  a  critical  role  in  the
technological  advancement  and  the  economic  advancement  of  this
country, which are the envy of the world. Within the biotech indus-
try,  and  companies  such  as  mine,  if  I  have  a  Phase  III  that  costs
tens  of  millions  of  dollars  to  run  through  clinical  trials,  that  is
where my investors are putting their money. So even though I have
raised  $140  million,  I  have  $20  million  left,  and  all  of  it  is  dedi-
cated to the later stage programs. If I can get SBIR grants to fund
my  nerve  growing  technology,  and  I  can  prove  that  it  works,  the
venture capitalists will put in the scores of millions of dollars that
it will take me to get it the rest of the way and bring it to people.
But  without  the  SBIR  program,  even  within  my  company  that
has raised so much money, I cannot move those programs forward.
Thank you very much.

Key Points:

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RON COHEN

• The biotechnology industry is unique in that it takes at least several hundred
million dollars and an average of 10–15 years to develop a drug from concept
through  to  market.  Biotechnology  companies  therefore  must  rely  on  venture
investment as well as grant sources for sufficient funding.

• By  imposing  an  unnecessary  restriction  against  venture  capital  owned  small
business,  the  SBIR  program  is  denying  talented  scientists  the  opportunity  to
develop  new  therapies  and  medical  technologies  at  an  early  stage,  to  achieve
sufficient proof of principle so that venture capitalists will be willing to invest
in  them.  This  exclusion  is  not  consistent  with  the  purpose  of  the  SBIR  pro-
gram,  which  is  to  stimulate  small  businesses  that  will  commercialize  impor-
tant technological developments.

• A  prohibition  against  venture  capital  owned  companies  is  stifling  innovation
by  lowering  the  number  of  applicants  and  making  the  SBIR  program  less
competitive.  It  also  is  impeding  the  ability  of  the  National  Institutes  of
Health,  which  provide  most  of  the  SBIR  grants  received  by  biotechnology
companies,  to  accomplish  their  mission  of  improving  the  health  and  medical
care of the American people.

• I support BIO’s recommendation that the SBA adopt a rule that addresses the
actual  ownership  structure  of  small  biotechnology  companies  that  are  owned
and  controlled  by  venture  capital  companies.  Specifically,  change  the  size  re-
quirements  to  permit  venture  capital  ownership  of  SBIR  applicants  to  count
toward the 51 percent U.S. ownership and control requirement.

Good Morning. My name is Dr. Ron Cohen. I am the Founder, President and CEO
of  Acorda  Therapeutics.  Acorda  is  a  privately  held  biotechnology  company  located
in Hawthorne, New York. My company’s mission is to develop and market therapies
that restore neurological function to people with spinal cord injury, MS and related
conditions of the nervous system.

I  would  like  to  thank  the  Members  of  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  com-
ment on the current obstacles to participation in the Small Business Innovation Re-
search  (SBIR)  program  by  businesses  that  are  majority-owned  by  venture  capital
companies.

As you know, the biotechnology industry is unique in that it takes a large amount
of  capital—at  least  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars—to  develop  a  drug  from  concept
through  to  market.  These  costs  are  simply  too  high  for  individuals  to  fund.  Bio-
technology  companies  must  rely  on  venture  investment  and  grant  sources  for  suffi-
cient funding.

Small  biotechnology  companies  often  rely  on  SBIR  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  grants
to fund cutting edge research in areas that most venture capitalists would consider
too  early  stage  to  fund.  However,  according  to  the  current  eligibility  standards,  a
business must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by ‘‘individuals’’ who are
citizens of the United States and the company may not have more than 500 employ-
ees, including its affiliates.

The  problem  facing  the  biotechnology  industry  is  that  the  SBA’s  Office  of  Hear-
ings  and  Appeals  has  interpreted  the  term  ‘‘individuals’’  to  mean  human  beings.
There is no definition of the term ‘‘individual’’ in the law that established the SBIR
Program. The SBA’s current interpretation of ‘‘individuals’’ excludes venture capital
companies.

This  exclusion  is  not  consistent  with  the  purpose  of  the  SBIR  program,  which  is
to stimulate small businesses that will commercialize important technological devel-
opments.  Not  only  does  this  interpretation  go  against  Congress’  original  intent  for
the program, but it is likely also to stifle innovation by lowering the number of ap-
plicants and making the SBIR program less competitive.

A  recent  survey  conducted  by  the  Biotechnology  Industry  Organization  (BIO),  of
which  Acorda  is  a  member,  shows  that  SBA’s  interpretation  is  preventing  many
small  biotechnology  companies  from  participating  in  the  SBIR  program.  More  than
70  percent  of  the  companies  surveyed  were  privately  owned  small  businesses  with
fewer than 50 employees. However, many of these companies were deemed ineligible
to receive a SBIR grant due to their venture capital funding. In the past five years,
62 percent of the survey respondents, comprising both public and private companies,
had applied for SBIR grants. Half of these applicants were denied grants due to the
current interpretation of the size standards.

Finally,  more  than  60  percent  of  the  privately-held  companies  surveyed  reported
choosing  not  to  apply  for  SBIR  grants  at  all  due  to  perceived  eligibility  concerns.
The  results  of  BIO’s  survey  illustrate  the  negative  impact  that  the  exclusion  of
VC-backed companies is having on the biotechnology industry and on medical inno-
vation.  In  imposing  this  unnecessary  restriction,  the  SBIR  program  is  denying  tal-
ented  scientists  the  opportunity  to  develop  new  therapies  and  medical  technologies
at  their  early  stages,  to  achieve  sufficient  proof  of  principle  to  attract  venture  cap-
italists to invest in their later stages of development. It also is impeding the ability
of the National Institutes of Health, which provide most of the SBIR grants received
by biotechnology companies, to accomplish their mission of improving the health and
medical care of the American people. In the end, even the best science requires long,
risky  and  expensive  development  to  be  translated  into  usable  therapies,  something
that only companies are equipped to do effectively.

I  believe  Acorda  exemplifies  Congress’  original  intent  with  respect  to  the  SBIR
program. We currently employ 59 full-time associates, most of whom are highly edu-
cated  and  skilled.  Acorda  has  received  several  grants  through  the  SBIR  program
and  these  grants  have  been  critical  to  our  ability  to  develop  technologies  that  have
the  potential  to  benefit  people  living  with  spinal  cord  injury  and  multiple  sclerosis.
Our lead clinical product, Fampridine-SR, is a novel therapy that is the first shown
in  clinical  trials  to  improve  neurological  function,  such  as  walking  and  strength,  in
people with MS. SBIR grants supported early proof of concept data for this product
and  helped  persuade  venture  capitalists  to  support  subsequent  stages  of  develop-
ment. These venture capitalists have provided well over $140 million in investment
capital  to  date,  already  providing  the  SBIR  program  with  an  outstanding  ‘‘return’’
on  its  investment.  Acorda  recently  has  begun  a  large-scale,  pivotal  trial  of
Fampridine-SR in MS.

It  is  important  to  understand  that  even  small  businesses  that  have  raised  large
amounts  of  investment  capital  can  still  put  SBIR  grants  to  productive  use.  Typi-
cally, such companies’ invested venture capital is earmarked for the very expensive

later stage projects that require tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to complete.
But  these  same  companies  often  have  earlier  stage  projects,  as  well,  that  the  ven-
ture capital investors are unwilling to fund. Yet, because such companies have built
an  infrastructure  of  talented  professionals  to  develop  their  later  stage  programs,
and also have developed networks of venture capital investors, they are uniquely po-
sitioned  to  successfully  develop  their  earlier  stage  programs,  as  well.  SBIR  grants
can  and  do  provide  the  ‘‘proof  of  principle’’  required  by  these  early  stage  projects,
even  within  ‘‘well-funded’’  companies,  to  persuade  the  venture  capitalists  to  fund
subsequent stages of development.

I support BIO’s recommendation that the SBA adopt a rule that addresses the ac-
tual ownership structure of small biotechnology companies that are owned and con-
trolled  by  venture  capital  companies.  Specifically,  change  the  size  requirements  to
permit venture capital ownership of SBIR applicants to count toward the 51 percent
U.S. ownership and control requirement. This change would allow greater participa-
tion  in  the  SBIR  program  and  help  to  sustain  important  programs  at  small  compa-
nies  so  they  reach  the  point  where  novel  therapies  can  enter  the  clinic  and  poten-
tially save lives.

This  change  would  ensure  that  small  businesses  with  ownership  structures  simi-
lar  to  mine  would  be  able  to  benefit  from  this  important  program  and  pursue  re-
search  efforts  that  are  critical  to  improving  our  nation’s  health,  maintaining  its
technological leadership and advancing its economic well-being.

Thank you.

Chairman EHLERS. Mr. Cohen.

STATEMENT OF MR. JONATHAN COHEN, PRESIDENT AND CEO,

20/20 GENE SYSTEMS, INC.

Mr.  JONATHAN COHEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  after-
noon.  I  am  Jonathan  Cohen,  founder  and  CEO  of  20/20  Gene  Sys-
tems, a small biotechnology company based in Rockville, Maryland,
that was founded in 2000, and is focused on developing and bring-
ing to market innovative diagnostic products for biodefense, cancer,
and autoimmune diseases.

We currently have eight employees, and have raised over $2 mil-
lion in investment from both individual investors, often referred to
as  angels,  as  well  as  some  small  venture  capital  money,  and  some
corporate  investment,  and  have  won  about  a  half  a  dozen  SBIR
awards, and the SBIR program has played a vital role in our com-
pany’s success to date.

While Dr. Cohen and I share a last name, we do not share a com-
mon  vision  as  to  the  propriety  of  having  companies  owned  by  ven-
ture capital firms participating in the SBIR program. I am here to
strongly  discourage  Congress  from  passing  any  legislation  that
would permit institutionally owned companies, and I believe a com-
pany  owned  by  one  or  more  VCs  is  an  institutionally  owned  com-
pany,  from  accessing  the  tiny  2.5  percent  set  aside,  that  this  Con-
gress established for small companies owned by individuals.

Now,  to  the  extent  that  Acorda  Therapeutics  and  other  compa-
nies  owned  by  institutions  deserve  federal  support  for  their  R&D,
and  I  believe  in  many  cases  they  do,  for  technology  that  is  very
high risk, or for which the markets are unpredictable or small, bio-
defense,  orphan  diseases,  they  should  be  entitled  to  that  money,
but  it  should  come  out  of  the  other  97.5  percent  of  the  Federal
R&D  pie,  in  my  opinion.  To  do  otherwise  will  have  a  dramatic  ef-
fect  on  the  large  numbers  of  biotech  startups  that  are  individually
owned,  particularly  those  that  have  the  misfortune  of—I  started
my  company  in  March  of  2000,  about  a  week  before  the  so-called
bubble  burst,  and  the  last  five  years  have  been  a  very,  very  dif-
ficult time for biotech startups.

I  believe  that  if  Congress  were  to  change  the  size  standards,  as
has  been  proposed,  that  substantial  numbers  of  biotech  start-up
companies  will  go  out  of  business,  and  let  me  explain  why.  The
SBIR process, particularly at the NIH, is extremely resource inten-
sive.  It  costs  my  company—it  takes  about  six  weeks  for  full-time
Ph.D.s  to  work  on  a  Phase  I  SBIR  application,  and  twice  that
amount  of  time  for  a  Phase  II.  If  I  have  to—if  our  company  has
to  compete  with  Ron’s  company  that  has  raised  $132  million,  they
have  the  ability  to  prepare  more  applications  in  a  more  cost-effec-
tive  manner  than  we  do,  and  I  am  deeply  concerned  that  that  2.5
percent of the pie will effectively be one percent or .5 percent. That
is the consequence that I fear most.

Now,  why  should  that  be  of  concern  to  this  Congress?  I  believe
strongly  that  both  institutionally  owned  biotech  companies  and  in-
dividually  owned  biotech  companies  play  a  very  important  role  in
our economy and in our healthcare system, but it is a distinct role,
and  over  the  last  five  years,  the  venture  capital  community  has
overwhelmingly  invested  in  late  stage  drugs  for  large  markets.
That is not a criticism. Those are very important products, and the
products  that  we  heard  about  from  the  last  witness  deserve  sub-
stantial  funding.  But  there  is  a  lot  more  to  biotechnology  than
blockbuster drugs. Bioterrorism defense, ag biotech, research tools,
platform  technologies,  vaccine  development.  These  are  fields  that,
by  and  large,  have  been  ignored  by,  certainly,  the  large  venture
capital  firms,  and  we  need  this  2.5  percent  set  aside.  It  is  ex-
tremely important to enable those smaller companies to bring prod-
ucts to market.

Let  me  just  give  you  one  example.  Our  company,  at  the  height
of the anthrax incident that affected Capitol Hill in 2001, we devel-
oped and brought to market an important product called BioCheck,
that is used—right now, it is used by about 200 first responder or-
ganizations  throughout  the  country,  including  about  a  dozen  fed-
eral  agencies,  to  screen  suspicious  powders.  It  was  used  at  the
Kerry  campaign  headquarters  a  week  before  the  Democratic  Con-

before  the  elections.  We  would  not  have  been  able  to  bring  that
product  to  market  if  we  had  been  majority  owned  by  venture  cap-
ital  firms,  because  they  would  have  perceived  the  markets  as  too
small and the risks too high.

So  the  small,  individually  owned  biotech  companies  are  a  com-
munity  of  companies  worth  protecting.  Yes,  venture  owned  compa-
nies  should  be  entitled  to  obtain  federal  support  for  certain  areas

of  high  risk,  high  impact  R&D,  but  that  should  come  out  of  the
other  97.5  percent  of  the  Federal  R&D  pie.  And  there  are,  by  the
way,  increasing  programs  at  the  NIH  to  address  that.  In  my  writ-
ten  testimony,  I  attached  an  article  from  the  Wall  Street  Journal
last week that talks about how the NIH is beginning to fund early
stage  clinical  trials  for  even  large  companies  like  Eli  Lilly.  This  is
a  trend,  by  the  way,  that  this  Congress  should  encourage,  and  I
would look forward to working with this committee and its staff in
developing  new  programs  that  support  deserving  programs  from
large  companies  that  do  not  destroy  the  small,  innovative  bio-
technology companies.

Thank you for considering my testimony this afternoon.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN COHEN

Good afternoon. I am Jonathan Cohen,1 founder and CEO of 20/20 GeneSystems,
a  small  biotechnology  company  based  in  Rockville,  Maryland  focused  on  developing
and  bringing  to  market  innovative  diagnostics  for  biodefense,  cancer,  and  auto-im-
mune  diseases.  Before  starting  20/20  in  2000  I  worked  as  in-house  counsel  for  two
publicly traded biotechnology companies.

As  a  company  with  eight  employees  owned  by  about  a  dozen  individuals  and  a
few  institutional  investors,  the  SBIR  program  has  played  a  vital  role  in  20/20’s
progress  and  success.  We  are  deeply  concerned,  however,  that  if  the  SBIR  size
standards were changed to permit companies owned and controlled by large venture
capital  firms  to  qualify  for  this  small  pool  of  funding  we  could  loose  our  ability  to
continue  to  bring  innovative  products  to  market.  Hundreds  of  small  and  biotech
companies  like  20/20  throughout  the  country  could  be  put  out  of  business  by  this
change.  We  therefore  urge  that  the  size  standards  for  this  program  be  left  intact
and  that  companies  that  are  not  small  businesses  (as  traditionally  defined)  instead
look  outside  this  2.5  percent  set-aside  for  appropriate  and  needed  government  sup-
port.
Likely  Consequences  of  the  Proposed  Change  to  SBIR  Size  Qualifications
Because  the  SBIR  application  process  is  so  resource  intensive,  especially  at  the
NIH,  opening  up  the  program  to  companies  owned  and  controlled  by  deep-pocketed
investment houses presents a genuine risk that a significant percentage of available
funds  will  be  siphoned  away  from  the  very  companies  for  which  the  SBIR  program
was  created  to  support.  In  other  words,  the  2.5  percent  set  aside  for  small  compa-
nies  (as  they  have  been  traditionally  defined)  could  quickly  become  one  percent  or
0.5 percent. There would be several key consequences of this change.

First, it would shift funding away from areas of research underway at many small
companies  that  is  critical  for  public  health  and  national  security  but  out  of  favor
with  Wall  Street.  This  includes  biodefense,  vaccine  development,  diagnostics,  plat-
form  technologies,  research  tools,  orphan  disease  therapies,  agricultural  bio-
technology, environmental biotech, etc. For example, just after the anthrax mailings
here  on  Capitol  Hill  in  2001  our  company  developed  a  novel  method  of  screening
suspicious  powders  and  brought  it  to  market  the  following  year.  Today  our
BioCheckΤΜ test kit is routinely used by more than 300 federal, State, and local first
responder  organizations  nationwide.  Had  we  been  owned  and  controlled  by  one  or
more  large  VC  firms  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  this  popular  and  important  product
would have been permitted to be developed and commercialized due to the relatively
small market it addresses and liability risk as would be perceived by our large cor-
porate owners.

Second,  it  would  decrease  support  for  high-impact,  high-risk  innovative  research
which  small,  independently  owned  companies  historically  excel  at  in  favor  of  lower
risk  product  development  favored  by  most  VCs  today.  The  following  observation  by
John F. Wong, Ph.D. who writes a monthly ‘‘Wall Street Biobeat’’ column in Genetic
Engineering News accurately describes the current state of biotech investment:

The  biotech  industry  seems  to  be  at  a  crossroads  as  it  enters  the  second  half
of  its  50-year  cycle.  With  the  focus  now  on  developing  products  that  are
already  in  clinical  development,  the  industry  appears  to  be  moving
away from its core strength of research and innovation.
Frustrated by not reaping the benefits of the genomic and proteomic revolution
of  the  1990s, biotech investors now seem to be more risk adverse. Their
investment strategy is to focus on investing in companies with products
in  late  stages  of  clinical  development,  which  they  believe  will  receive
FDA approval. (Emphasis added)2

This  phenomenon  was  reiterated  last  week  by  several  leading  venture  capitalists

attending the annual meeting of the Biotechnology Industry organization:

‘‘In the late 1990s, investors were willing to back early-stage technology phases
of  biotechnology,’’  said  Jim  Barett,  an  analyst  and  general  partner  of  New  En-
terprise  Associates.  ‘‘Now  the  investment  community  is  moving  toward  later-
stage projects. That means that early-stage projects are having difficulty raising
money in this environment of risk discounting.’’ 3

However,  what’s  best  for  Wall  Street  is  not  always  best  for  America.  VCs  play  a
critical  role  in  support  of  important  segments  of  the  biotechnology  industry  but
blockbuster drugs are not the only need of our health care system. Diagnostics and
new  platform  technologies,  for  example,  receive  little  interest  from  large  VCs  but
are  essential  for  both  biodefense  and  the  emerging  field  of  ‘‘personalized  medicine’’
where the optimum therapies are tailored to patients based on their genetic disease
profile.4 Small biotech companies supported by the SBIR program are making major
advancements in these important areas of R&D.

Furthermore,  as  reported  by  Business  Week  in  March,  individual  Angel  investors
are  filling  some  of  the  funding  gap  in  high-risk  early  stage  biotech  investing  that
has  been  vacated  by  VCs,  pouring  nearly  $2  billion  into  biotech  last  year,  up  more
than 60 percent from 2002 (Attachment). Having raised over $2 million from Angels
I  can  report,  however,  that  this  is  very  time  consuming  process  that  relies  on  the
SBIR program to keep our R&D advancing and to provide these non-professional in-
vestors with independent validation of our technology.

Third, it would likely discourage the VC community from deploying the staggering
$50 billion in unspent funds sitting in their coffers5 by relying on SBIR grants rather
than  making  follow-on  investments  in  their  portfolio  companies.  The  proposed  eligi-
bility changes would simply be giving more ‘‘snow to the Eskimos.’’

Finally, it would hurt regions of the country with a small life science investor base,
such as Maryland, to the benefit of Boston and San Francisco that are home to many
seasoned biotech VCs. At the Maryland Technology Development Center (MTDC) in
Rockville,  a  county  operated  facility  that  houses  one  of  the  largest  numbers  of
biotech start-ups in the mid-Atlantic region not a single biotech company has raised
a  first  round  of  venture  capital  since  we  became  tenants  there  in  2001  but  most
have  been  funded  through  the  SBIR  program.  The  biotech  entrepreneurs  at  the
MTDC overwhelmingly oppose BIO’s efforts to change the SBIR size standards.6 Yet
many of these companies are quite productive, and, like 20/20 have managed to de-
velop  and  launch  innovative  successful  biotechnology  products  with  the  support  of
the SBIR program, as well as Angel and some smaller institutional investors.

Simply  put,  a  company  owned  and  controlled  by  one  or  more  large  VC  firms  is
not  a  small  business  and  should  not  be  entitled  access  the  minuscule  percentage  of
funds set aside for small businesses. These companies typically lack the culture and
attributes  of  small,  individually  owned  companies  including  the  ability  to  ‘‘turn  on

3 ‘‘Investors: Show us the Drugs,’’ Business Gazette, June 24, 2005.
4 The new paradigm of individualized medicine—strongly being pushed by the FDA—will like-
ly  create  demand  for  drugs  to  ‘‘niche’’  diseases,  as  defined  by  molecular  profiling,  with  signifi-
cantly  smaller  markets  than  traditional  ‘‘blockbuster’’  drugs.  This  will  likely  increase  the  role
of smaller biotech companies which can focus on smaller markets than large companies.

5 Dow Jones VentureOne, March 2005.
6 It  should  be  pointed  out  that  BIO  does  not  represent  or  speak  for  the  entire  biotechnology
industry  and  certainly  not  most  small  companies.  At  best  it  speaks  only  for  its  membership
which is heavily weighted by very large companies that are either publicly traded or have com-
pleted several large rounds of institutional investment. I was a member of BIO a few years ago
and took part in several of its committee meetings. I was stunned by the extent to which these
forums  were  dominated  by  professional  lobbyists  employed  by  large  pharmaceutical  companies
and  how  few  small  company  entrepreneurs  took  part  in  these  meetings.  In  my  view  BIO  lacks
standing to address issues impacting small, individually owned companies since that community
is so under-represented in its membership and leadership.

a  dime,’’  take  substantial  risks,  and  address  smaller  and  less  predictable  markets,
including  those  unpopular  on  Wall  Street.  To  permit  this  change  would  essentially
take the ‘‘S’’ out of SBIR.
Large Entities Should Look Beyond SBIR

Proponents  of  changing  longstanding  definitions  of  ‘‘small  business’’  are  ‘‘barking
up  the  wrong  tree’’  by  pressing  for  changes  to  the  SBIR  size  standards  when  they
should instead be focusing their efforts on the other 97.5 percent of the federal R&D
pie  not  set  aside  for  small  individually  owned  companies.  While  historically  most
NIH  funding  has  gone  to  support  academic  basic  research,  this  has  been  changing
over the last few years. Today there is an expanding number of programs available
to  businesses  of  all  sizes  at  the  NIH  and  other  agencies  for  high-risk,  high-impact
R&D  or  the  development  of  products  with  small  or  unpredictable  markets  such  or-
phan  drugs  or  vaccines  to  bioterror  agents.  These  programs  collectively  have  sub-
stantially more funding available than the SBIR program. For example, as reported
last  week  in  The  Wall  Street  Journal,  the  NIH  is  beginning  to  offer  to  pay  for  and
carry out early clinical trials of high-risk experimental drugs for certain diseases for
which  improved  therapies  have  been  lacking  for  decades.  (Attachment)  Pharma-
ceutical  giant  Eli  Lilly  is  among  the  companies  reportedly  taking  part  in  this  new
program.

Congress  should  encourage  this  trend  and  consider  new  initiatives,  open  to  com-
panies  of  all  size,  that  help  bridge  the  growing  ‘‘valley  of  death’’  between  basic  dis-
coveries  and  delivery  to  patients  of  innovative  drugs,  devices,  and  diagnostics.7 At
the same time, the integrity of programs like SBIR that safeguard the viability and
productivity  of  our  nation’s  small  risk  taking  biotech  entrepreneurs  must  be  pro-
tected.

Thanks for considering my testimony today.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JONATHAN COHEN

In  2000  Jonathan  Cohen  founded  20/20  GeneSystems,  Inc.  a  biotechnology  com-
pany  dedicated  to  developing  novel  diagnostic  products  for  biodefense,  cancer,  and
auto-immune diseases. In 2004 he was one of three nominees for the ‘‘Entrepreneur
of  the  Year’’  award  from  the  Technology  Council  of  Maryland.  As  CEO  of  20/20  he
lead the company in raising over $2.5 in investment capital, procuring over $1 mil-
lion  in  Federal  Government  contracts  and  grants,  and  launching  two  innovative
technology  products,  one  for  biodefense  and  another  for  life  science  research.  The
company  currently  has  two  diagnostic  products  in  its  development  pipeline,  one  for
biodefense  (radiological  biomarkers)  and  another  for  predicting  the  efficacy  of  tar-
geted cancer therapies.

Prior to starting 20/20 served as General and Patent Counsel of Oncor, Inc., which
pioneered  the  first  gene-based  cancer  diagnostic  approved  by  the  FDA.  In  that  ca-
pacity  he  facilitated  numerous  corporate  alliances  and  technology  licensing  trans-
actions.

Mr.  Cohen  is  a  registered  patent  attorney  with  over  14  years  experience  in  bio-
technology patents and licensing matters. He has a Master of Science degree in Bio-
technology  from  Johns  Hopkins  University  in  addition  to  a  law  degree  from  Amer-
ican  University.  Mr.  Cohen  previously  served  on  the  Patent  Committee  of  the  Bio-
technology  Industry  Organization  and  is  an  active  member  of  the  Government  Af-
fairs Committee of the Technology Council of Maryland.

He is a former volunteer firefighter and Emergency Medical Technician.
Chairman  EHLERS.  It  is  delightful  to  see  such  unanimity  among
the  witnesses.  The  buzzers  that  you  heard  indicate  we  have  votes
going  on  on  the  Floor.  I  think  we  can  get  your  testimony  in,  Dr.
Nacy, if you don’t linger on it, and then, we will have to recess and
return.

7 This  could  include  a  new  Advanced  Healthcare  Technology  Development  Program,  modeled
after  the  NIST  ATP  program,  focused  on  supporting  innovative  platform  technologies  that  im-
prove disease diagnosis and therapy selection, drug development, and clinical research. Funding
for  high-risk  technology  development  is  severely  lacking  from  both  the  NIH  and  private  inves-
tors  despite  the  significant  impact  this  can  have  on  our  nation’s  health  care  system.  At  least
10  percent  of  the  NIH  budget  should  be  set  aside  for  high-impact  technology  development  in
fields not supported by VCs or corporations.

STATEMENT OF DR. CAROL A. NACY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, SEQUELLA, INC.

Dr.  NACY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  hearing  me  through,
and  thank  you,  Committee  Members,  for  offering  me  the  oppor-
tunity to give you my perspective on the effect of the current inter-
pretation of the law on both my company and on my industry.

Sequella, Inc. is an eight year old biopharmaceutical company de-
veloping products for tuberculosis, a disease that is a global health
threat of awesome proportions. In the world, two billion people, out
of  a  total  six,  that  is  one  out  of  every  three  people  in  the  world,
has  tuberculosis.  And  15  percent  of  these  people  will  come  down
with this disease in their lifetime, in the next 30 to 50 years. That
is  300  million  people  with  tuberculosis.  Annually,  there  are  now
over  10  million  new  cases  of  TB  every  year,  and  over  two  million
deaths. TB is an aerosol transmitted disease. It is of concern to the
United States, because it is a listed biothreat agent.

Although  we  have  indigenous  tuberculosis  under  control  in  our
country,  we  exist  in  a  global  economy,  and  we  import  tuberculosis
into the United States inside of people who travel here for business
or for pleasure, or to immigrate permanently as citizens from areas
in  which  tuberculosis  has  literally  overwhelmed  public  health  sys-
tems. In fact, all over Asia, China, India, South America, and Afri-
ca, only on this continent and in Australia do we not have an over-
whelming TB problem.

We  risk  having  tuberculosis  walk  across  our  borders  in  a  drug-
resistant  form  that  would  totally  annihilate  our  public  health  con-
trol  systems.  And  I  will  just  give  you  one  example  of  how  quickly
this  can  occur.  In  New  York  City,  once  we  had  block  grants,  they
shut  down  a  $50  million  a  year  TB  control  program  that,  for  the
city  itself,  and  within  three  years  of  the  closure  of  that  program,
multi-drug-resistant  TB  epidemic  occurred  in  New  York  City  that
cost  $1  billion  and  two  years  to  get  under  control.  TB  is  definitely
not a disease that you want to underestimate.

Sequella was established as a for-profit company in 1997 to solve
the problem that the U.S. Public Health Service, in the form of the
CDC  and  the  NIH,  recognized  as  a  time  bomb,  the  reasserting  of
control  for  resurgent  TB  in  New  York  City  and  in  the  other  urban
areas  of  this  country,  was  hampered  by  the  fact  that  products  for
control of TB are 50 to 100 years old. Although TB was the number
one killer of U.S. citizens prior to 1950, the antibiotic era made us
complacent.  So,  Sequella  was  established  to  reverse  the  industry
trend of no attention to tuberculosis.

We have been financed over the last eight years through Founder
and  Director  equity  investments,  investments  by  angel  investors,
and  a  variety  of  competitive  scientific  research  grants,  including
grants  and  contracts  from  the  SBIR  program.  We  have  competed
for  and  received  SBIR  funding  for  diagnostics,  devices,  vaccines,
and  drugs,  all  focused  on  TB.  And  the  total  amount  of  funding  in
the  SBIR  grant  contract  program  that  we  have  received  to  date  is
over  $6.5  million—and  I  have  given  you  a  table  on  page  2—out  of
a total of $18 million raised for my company.

Despite  the  healthy  success  of  the  SBIR  grant  competition,  we
will require $10 million in additional funds over the next two years
to  complete  the  clinical  trials  of  a  brand  new  diagnostic  that  can

actually detect active TB, and initiate the clinical trials of a brand
new  drug  that,  in  animals,  is  both  more  effective  and  quicker  act-
ing than the current treatment of six to nine months.

The  SBIR  programs  at  NIH  are  designed  to  stimulate  the  re-
search  and  development  of  products  for  diseases  of  interest  to  our
Federal Government regardless of the commercial interests in such
products. TB is such a disease. It is a U.S. problem with little ongo-
ing  commercial  effort.  The  amount  of  money  and  the  structure  of
the  SBIR  program  means  that  the  costs  of  identifying  and  devel-
oping  new  products  for  this  devastating  disease  are  only  begun
with  the  SBIR  program.  The  overall  costs  for  getting  something
into  the  clinic  is  $2  to  $5  million  just  for  the  animal  studies,  and
anywhere  from  $30  million  to  $150  million  for  the  clinical  trials.
We  have  to  find  the  money  somewhere  to  get  the  product  out  that
we started with the SBIR program.

I  don’t  know  of  anyone  who  is  interested  in  providing  me  with
$150 million total amount of money, unless it is the venture capital
groups who understand high risk and high reward. The VC money
is clearly for——

Chairman EHLERS. Excuse me.
Dr. NACY. Yes, sir.
Chairman  EHLERS.  Hold  that  thought.  We  will  have  to  recess

and go vote, and we will pick up with you.

Dr. NACY. Okay.
Chairman  EHLERS.  Give  you  a  little  extra  time  when  we  return.
[Recess.]
Chairman  EHLERS.  I  apologize  for  the  interruption.  It  happens
here frequently. Dr. Nacy, we were in the midst of your testimony.
Actually,  we  were  at  the  end,  but  I  will  give  you  a  little,  a
couple——

Dr. NACY. Thank you.
Chairman EHLERS. I will give you a couple minutes to add what-

ever additional thoughts you wanted to express.

Dr. NACY. I basically wanted—oh, I am sorry. Go ahead.
Chairman  EHLERS.  And  we  will  go  to  Dr.  Abramson.  And  I,  un-
fortunately,  have  to  go  to  another  meeting,  but  we  will  import
someone  else  to  chair  this  meeting  during  that  time,  and  I  apolo-
gize in advance for having to leave.

Dr. Nacy.
Dr. NACY. Yes, I just wanted to mention what the impact of this
current  interpretation  of  the  law  regarding  SBIR  programs  means
to  Sequella.  We  are  currently  not  venture  financed.  For  the  last
two  years,  I  have  been  raising  money  in  the  venture  community.
I  have  finally  gotten  two  people  who  are—who  believe  that  tuber-
culosis is an appropriate company focus for Sequella, and are inter-
ested in financing us.

I  hope  to  close  the  financing  by  the  end  of  the  summer,  but  at
the same time, I have my SBIR grants that both exist, and I have
two  applications  in  that  have  been  approved,  but  not  yet  funded,
and  will  be  funded  by  the  end  of  the  year,  worth  $2  million  to  the
company.  And  so,  of  course,  these—this  interpretation  affects  my
company  specifically,  but  also  affects  every  other  company  that  is
in the process of trying to commercialize products. The SBIR mon-
eys  and  the  VC  moneys  don’t  commingle.  They  are  used  sequen-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

42

tially.  The  SBIR  moneys  are  used  to  identify  new  and  potential
products that will be useful to mankind, and the VC money is used
to  get  them  clinically  evaluated  and  bring  them  to  commercializa-
tion.  And  so,  not  having  the  access  to  both  sides  of  that  equation
means  that  I  will  either  commercialize  what  exists  today,  and  for-
get ever developing any new products for TB in the future, or I will
continue  to  identify  products  that  will  never  make  it  to  patients,
and  basically,  that—this  has  put  me  within  a  rock  and  a  hard
place.  The  venture  money  will  be  specifically  for  the  clinical  trials
of the new TB drug, and if there is anything left over, for the new
TB diagnostic.

I just also wanted to rebut the issue of the 2.5 percent for compa-
nies. We really can only compete as companies for the SBIR grant,
and  it  is  very,  very  difficult  to  access  the  rest  of  the  money  from
the  NIH  programs,  because  we  do  not  do  hypothesis-driven  re-
search.  We  do  product  development,  which  is  guided  by  FDA  rules
and regulations, and there is not a lot of flexibility in what we can
do  when  we  develop  a  new  drug.  So,  we  are  not  competitive.  I,  as
a scientist, sit on review boards for the grants for R01 grants, and
in  fact,  just  finished  one  last  Thursday,  in  which  no  company  was
actually  awarded  or  approved  for  grant  funding.  All  academics.  As
it  probably  should  be,  because  we  do  have  the  SBIR  program,  as
long as we are not yet venture financed.

I think the country, and I think the government, will only benefit
if the best product-oriented science is funded, and it will only ben-
efit  if  that  product-oriented  science  ends  up  with  a  product  that
can be used by patients. I think the two sides of that equation have
to be together. The venture financing is critical for getting products
out there. The SBIR grant program is critical for innovation in the
early stage research.

And  I  think  that  I  would  like  just,  then,  to  close  and  thank  you

for the opportunity to present this opinion.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAROL A. NACY

Points:

• Medical  R&D  SBIR  Programs  (NIH,  DOD)  were  designed  to  initiate  R&D  on
products  for  diseases  of  importance  to  the  U.S.  public  health.  Program  re-
quires  companies  to  (a)  show  evidence  of  follow-on  funding  for  product  com-
mercialization  and  (b)  commercialize  a  product  from  at  least  one  Phase  II
grant (or no more SBIR grants can be awarded).
• Sources  of  follow-on  funding  are  limited  in  the  high-risk  clinical  phase  of
product  development  because  of  the  cost  of  these  development  tasks  (hun-
dreds  of  millions  of  dollars):  VC  are  virtually  only  source  of  capital  in  this
quantity.
• SBIR  and  VC  moneys  do  not  co-mingle:  they  are  used  sequentially  for  re-
search (SBIR) and clinical trials/commercialization (VC): both are essential to
bring products to marketplace for use by physicians/patients.
• SBIR  grants  should  focus  on  the  best  science,  regardless  of  VC  financing  of

companies.

Mr. Chairman and Committee:

Thank  you  for  offering  me  the  opportunity  to  provide  information  about  the  im-
pact of the ruling on eligibility of VC-backed companies for SBIR grants on my com-
pany and my industry.

Sequella, Inc. is an eight-year-old biopharmaceutical company discovering and de-
veloping products for the diagnosis and control of tuberculosis (TB), a global health

threat  of  truly  awesome  proportions:  two  billion  people  (one  of  every  three  in  the
world) are infected with the bacterium today, and 15 percent of these people (or 300
million) will come down with fulminant and lethal TB in their lifetime, the next 30–
50 years. There are now nearly 10 million new cases of TB every year and over two
million  deaths  annually.  TB  is  an  aerosol-transmitted  debilitating  disease  that  is
listed as a biothreat agent of concern to the U.S. Government.

Although  we  have  indigenous  TB  almost  under  control  in  our  country,  we  exist
in  a  global  economy  and  we  import  TB  on  a  daily  basis  inside  people  who  travel
for  business  or  pleasure  or  immigrate  for  permanent  citizenship  from  areas  of  the
world  that  are  overwhelmed  by  this  disease.  Until  we  solve  the  global  problem  of
TB,  our  country  is  at  risk  for  the  importation  of  drug-resistant  TB  from  elsewhere
that  will  quickly  undermine  our  public  health  efforts  at  control.  Just  one  example:
New  York  City  closed  down  their  $50  million/year  TB  control  program  in  the  late
1980s.  Within  three  years  of  closure,  New  York  City  underwent  a  mini-epidemic  of
TB  and  drug-resistant  TB  that  cost  the  city  over  $1  billion  dollars  and  two  years
to control. TB is not a disease to ignore or underestimate.

Sequella  was  established  as  a  for-profit  company  in  1997  to  solve  a  problem  that
the  U.S.  Public  Health  Service  (CDC  and  NIH)  recognized  as  a  time-bomb:  the  re-
asserting of control for resurgent TB in the 1990s in New York City and other urban
centers  in  the  U.S.  was  strongly  hampered  by  the  techniques  available  to  diagnose
and treat the disease, techniques which are 50–100 years old. Although TB was the
#1  killer  of  U.S.  citizens  prior  to  1950,  the  antibiotic  era  of  1950–1990  allowed  us
to become complaisant about infectious diseases, and no new antibiotics were discov-
ered  or  developed  for  TB  since  mid-1970s.  Sequella  was  established  to  reverse  this
industry trend.

Sequella  has  been  financed  over  the  last  eight  years  through  Founder  and  Direc-
tor equity investments, investment by Angel investors, and a variety of competitive
scientific research grants, including grants and contracts from the SBIR program at
the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH).  We  have  competed  for  and  received  SBIR
funding  for  diagnostics,  devices,  vaccines  and  drugs,  all  focused  on  TB:  the  total
amount  of  funding  under  the  SBIR  grant/contract  program  alone  was  about  $6.5
million  (see  Table  1),  out  of  a  total  of  $18  million  raised  overall  for  the  company.

Despite the healthy success of SBIR grant competition, Sequella will require over
$10  million  in  additional  funds  in  the  next  two  years  to  complete  the  clinical  trials
of  its  new  and  more  effective  diagnostic  and  initiate  the  clinical  trials  of  its  new
drug  that,  in  animals,  is  both  more  effective  than  existing  drugs  and  shortens  the
treatment time for cure.

The  SBIR  programs  at  NIH  are  designed  to  stimulate  research  and  development
of  products  for  diseases  of  interest  to  the  Federal  Government,  regardless  of  com-
mercial  interests  in  such  products.  TB  is  such  a  disease:  a  U.S.  problem  with  little
ongoing  commercial  effort.  The  amount  of  money  and  structure  of  SBIR  grants
($75K–$300K  Phase  I;  $750K–$2M  Phase  II)  is  sufficient  only  to  start  the  process
of drug, diagnostic, or vaccine discovery and development. The overall costs of devel-
opment  of  a  new  product  from  the  time  that  the  research  looks  promising  is  over-
whelmingly  large,  and  the  money  to  cover  these  costs  is  extremely  difficult  to  find:

— Preclinical  toxicity  studies  for  drugs/vaccines  range  from  $2M–$5M  in  cost/

product candidate

— Clinical  trials  for  a  single  drug/vaccine  range  from  $30M  to  $150M/product,

depending upon indication

Non-SBIR  money  is  clearly  required  to  bridge  the  funding  gap  to  get  a  product
to  the  patients  it  is  to  serve:  the  only  source  for  that  large  an  amount  of  money
going  to  a  high-risk  venture  such  as  drug  development  (with  one  in  5000  success
rate)  is  venture  capital  (VC).  VC  money  is  for  clinical  development  and  commer-
cialization,  not  the  high-risk  discovery  research  or  early  translational  research  be-
fore the clinic: research into new targets of interest to government is last on priority
list with VC money, and rightly so. They must push companies to develop a product
revenue stream so that they can exit their high-risk investment with an acceptable
return on investment.

Specific impact of the eligibility ruling: Sequella, Inc. has two SBIR grant applica-
tions (a Phase I for $300K and a Phase II for $1.6M) that are in a queue for funding
in  this  FY  2005.  Funding  is  expected  by  late  summer.  Sequella  is  also  completing
its  first  VC  financing  to  fund  the  clinical  trials  of  the  new  TB  drug  and  the  new
TB diagnostic that were developed with NIH SBIR and other grant funds. The loss
to Sequella of the ∼$2M SBIR grants for its portfolio products NOT ready for clinical
trials  will  be  a  significant  loss  to  the  company  and  will  not  be  replaced  by  VC  fi-
nancing.  Without  SBIR  support,  we  would  not  have  spent  the  time  and  energy  on
TB,  a  disease  that  is  not  considered  a  commercial  opportunity  in  the  U.S.  Without
the  grant  support  in  the  future,  our  remarkable  research  success  in  finding  new
diagnostics,  drugs,  and  vaccines  for  important  non-commercial  diseases  of  impor-
tance to the U.S. will stop.

In Sequella, and I suspect in most other small biotechnology companies, the SBIR
and VC money will not co-mingle, but will be used sequentially for product develop-
ment: research (SBIR) funding will drive new product identification; commercializa-
tion  (VC)  funding  will  bring  the  identified  product  to  market  for  use  by  patients.
Both  sources  of  capital  are  critical  for  product  success.  Most  VC-backed  bio-
technology  companies  remain  small  businesses  (many  of  them  very  small:  Sequella
has  only  17  employees),  and  the  addition  of  VC  to  the  Board  or  VC  commercializa-
tion  funds  to  the  treasury  does  not  make  them  any  larger  or  less  in  need  of  dis-
covery research funding.

I  have  heard  comments  that  the  SBIR  set-aside  moneys  are  only  2.5  percent  of
grant support available at the NIH. I continue to review grants for the NIH in non-
SBIR  programs,  and  I  can  tell  you  from  personal  experience  that  companies  do  not
compete  well  in  this  arena.  The  reason?  We  do  not  do  hypothesis-driven  research.
Our  research  is  governed  by  rules  and  regulations  of  the  FDA  for  product  develop-
ment, and even the discovery research we do does not address fundamental biology,
but  product-oriented  processes  not  amenable  to  review  by  academicians  who  drive
the R01 granting processes at the NIH.

Competition  with  other  small  business  industries  does  not  exist  for  NIH  SBIR
programs: only biotechnology/biopharma companies compete for the dedicated small
business set-aside moneys from NIH and DOD for medical research. Thus, the argu-
ment  that  VC-backed  small  biotechnology  companies  in  medical  research  are  un-
fairly competing for small business funds in general is erroneous: only science-based
companies  can  compete  for  the  NIH/DOD  medical  research  funds.  Although  having
VC  investment  provides  an  opportunity  to  be  a  successful  company  that  commer-
cializes products, VC investment does not provide a scientific advantage for compa-
nies:  science  is  reviewed  for  its  merits,  not  its  financial  backing.  Good  science  that
is  competitive  can  come  from  VC-backed  companies  or  companies  that  are  not  VC-
backed.  Sequella  is  an  example  of  the  latter:  we  have  been  highly  successful  at
grant competitions, although we are not yet VC financed. I am absolutely sure that
we  will  be  as  competitive  when  we  have  VC  funding.  Competition  is  based  on  sci-
entific  merit,  and  for  the  best  science  to  prevail,  we  should  all  (VC-backed  or  not)
be in the mix.

The country will only benefit if all the best product-oriented science is funded, but
it  will  also  only  benefit  if  that  science  is  transformed  from  a  promise  to  a  product,
and that will happen most efficiently in VC-backed companies with sufficient funds
to make it though the costly clinical development process.

Thank  you  again  for  the  opportunity  to  express  my  views  before  the  Committee.

STATEMENT OF DR. FREDERIC D. ABRAMSON, PRESIDENT

AND CEO, ALPHAGENICS, INC.

Dr. ABRAMSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This is ob-
viously  an  issue  on  which  reasonable  people  agree  to  disagree  rea-
sonably. 
founder  and  CEO  of
AlphaGenics, a small life sciences firm in Rockville.

I  am  Frederic  Abramson, 

I  founded  AlphaGenics  in  1999  to  use  genetic  information  to  de-
velop  innovative  products  for  consumers.  Two  products  under  de-
velopment  now  include  JeneJuice,  a  sports  drink  that  is  custom
blended based on a person’s genetic makeup, and SkyGene, a hand-
held electronic device that lets people share information about their
genes  for  personality  and  other  non-disease  social  information.  We
have also identified a new way in which the right mix of nutrients
in a person’s diet could prevent influenza.

I  also  teach  in  the  Master’s  degree  program  in  biotechnology  at
Johns Hopkins, where I teach economics, finance, creating the bio-
technology  enterprise.  My  Ph.D.  is  in  human  genetics,  from  Michi-
gan.  I  have  a  Masters  of  Management  from  MIT,  where  I  was  a
Sloan  Fellow.  I  also  am  an  attorney.  I  am  admitted  to  the  patent
bar and the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court.

The  essential  point  that  I  want  to  make  here  is  that  the  small
business  ownership  standards,  as  these  relate  to  SBIR  awards,  is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

that no change should be made in the current interpretation of the
law. In other words, biotech companies that are majority owned by
VC should not be permitted to compete for SBIR funds. Any change
that  permits  venture  owned  small  businesses  to  compete  for  SBIR
will jeopardize biotechnology innovation as we know it today. There
are three central reasons why no change should be made.

The  first  point  is  that  changing  the  rule  will  open  the  door  to
large  companies  and  venture  capitalists  who  can  form  syndicates
and spin off entities to do the research, funded by SBIR, that they
normally  would  fund  themselves.  There  won’t  be  any  meaningful
way  to  distinguish  ownership,  about  who  is  eligible  and  who  isn’t,
so a Fortune 1000 company could be part of a syndicate that would
own a small company and get SBIR funding to fund their research
that  they  would  otherwise  do  in-house.  More  important,  their  vast
resources which they have at their disposal means they can assem-
ble the better looking teams to compete for SBIR in the evaluation
process. They will have powerful academic credentials, and this ac-
tually  increases  their  unfair  advantage  in  the  competitive  process
at NIH. If I were head of R&D of a Fortune 1000 company, I would
take  every  research  project  that  came  to  me,  work  to  get  it  syn-
dicated,  and  spin  it  out  in  one  of  these  small  businesses  to  get
SBIR funding.

Secondly,  under  the  current  rules,  VCs  have  a  choice  between
owning  49  percent  or  51  percent  of  a  business,  and  under  one
choice,  not  competing  by  SBIR,  or  the  other  choice,  competing.
These  two  percentage  points  is  what  separates  prudence  from
greed.  Under  the  current  rule,  the  investor  has  a  fair  choice  to
make,  and  they  can  make  the  choice  based  on  their  own  assess-
ment of the risks.

The  ownership  percentages  also  relate  to  valuation  for  the  busi-
ness.  That  is,  what  is  a  company  worth  when  someone  invests  in
it?  There  are  several  ways  to  calculate  valuation,  but  fundamen-
tally, the most powerful way valuation is determined is the negoti-
ating  position  of  the  parties.  If  a  VC  owned  firm  can  compete  for
SBIRs,  the  VC  can  drive  a  bargain  in  which  they  drive  down  the
valuation of the small business to get a better deal.

Finally,  there  is  a  practical  question,  and  a  practical  issue.  VCs
today  are  not  putting  the  money  in  early  stage  bio.  They  have
moved  downstream  into  later  stage  companies,  because  these  in-
vestments  are  more  attractive  and  lower  risk.  Many  of  the  compa-
nies they invest in, as noted earlier by another witnesses, have al-
ready  obtained  SBIR  funding,  which  gives  them  a  more  attractive
profile  for  funding.  VCs  also  are  only  a  small  percentage  of  the
total  bio  funding.  Angel  investors  and  corporate  investment  con-
stitute  a  major  portion  of  the  bio  investment  profile.  Most  of  these
deals don’t have the investor taking control of the business. So, this
is really—the current stand and the current rule is consistent with
the  longstanding  policy  that  small  bio  companies  need  a  chance  to
prove  their  value  to  become  attractive  to  investors,  not  the  other
way around.

So,  to  summarize,  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  an  Olympic  sized
swimming  pool  of  funds  available  from  NIH  and  DOD  that  every
company  in  the  United  States  can  compete  for,  and  large  compa-
nies  can  get  funds  to  innovate  in  science  and  technology.  And  we

52

know  organizations  like  Harvard,  Cal  Tech,  Yale,  Boeing,  Lock-
heed-Martin,  and  IBM  all  compete  for  these.  Congress  realized
years ago that small companies need a special kind of pool, a wad-
ing pool, if you will, to compete in.

And what we want here, and the VC backed firms are asking for,
these  are,  you  might  call,  young  adults.  They  don’t  like  swimming
in  the  big  pool  with  the  big  guys,  because  it  is  hard  to  swim  in,
so  they  want  to  get  over  in  the  baby  pool  with  the  little  guys,  to
get what is there.

It  is  well  documented  that  most  of  America’s  innovation  comes
from small companies. Permitting venture backed companies to ob-
tain  SBIR  funds  will  siphon  off  the  funds  that  small  companies
need, and will erode America’s competitive position in the world as
we know it.

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  share  these  views,  and  I  will

answer any questions.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Abramson follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF FREDRIC D. ABRAMSON

My name is Dr. Fredric Abramson, founder and CEO of AlphaGenics, a small life

science firm located in Rockville, Maryland.

I  founded  AlphaGenics  in  1999.  AlphaGenics  uses  genetic  information  to  develop
innovative  products  for  consumers.  Two  products  now  under  development  include
JeneJuice, a sports drink that is custom blended based on a person’s genetic make-
up,  and  SkyGene,  a  hand-held  electronic  device  that  lets  people  share  information
about their genes for personality and other non-disease social information. We have
also identified a new way in which the right mix of nutrients in a person’s diet could
prevent influenza.

I  also  teach  in  the  Master’s  of  Biotechnology  program  at  Johns  Hopkins  Univer-
sity. I teach courses in economics, finance and creating the biotechnology enterprise.
My Ph.D. is in Human Genetics from the University of Michigan. I have a Master’s
of Management from MIT, where I was an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow, and I hold a law
degree  from  American  University.  I  am  is  admitted  to  the  U.S.  patent  bar  and  the
bar of the United States Supreme Court, among others.

The  essential  point  for  the  Small  Business  ownership  standards  as  these  relate
to  Small  Business  Innovative  Research  funds  is  that  no  change  should  be  made  to
the  current  interpretation  of  the  law.  In  other  words,  biotech  companies  that  are
majority  owned  by  VCs  should  not  be  permitted  to  compete  for  SBIR  funds.  Any
change that permits venture owned small businesses to compete for SBIR will jeop-
ardize  biotechnology  innovation  as  we  know  it  today.  There  are  three  central  rea-
sons why no change should be made.

The  first  point  is  that  changing  the  rule  will  open  the  door  to  large  companies
and  venture  capitalists  spinning  off  and  owning  small  companies  to  obtain  SBIR
funds.  There  is  no  meaningful  way  to  distinguish  what  kind  of  majority  ownership
is not eligible. Each of the Fortune 1000 companies can create these eligible subsidi-
aries  to  cash  in  on  the  small  business  funding.  Worse,  their  vast  resources  means
they  will  be  able  to  assemble  better  looking  teams  with  powerful  academic  creden-
tials,  which  will  increase  their  unfair  advantage  in  obtaining  NIH  funds.  If  I  were
head  of  R&D  for  a  Fortune  1000  company,  I  would  spin  out  virtually  every  bio
project into a subsidiary to get SBIR funding.

Second, under the present rule, VCs have a choice: take 49 percent ownership and
compete  for  SBIR  funds,  or  take  51  percent  or  more  control  and  develop  the  com-
pany  on  your  own.  These  two  percentage  points  is  what  separates  prudence  from
greed.  Under  the  current  rules,  an  investor  has  a  fair  choice  to  make.  Take  control
of  the  small  business  and  be  excluded  from  SBIR  competitions,  or  take  a  minority
interest and let the small business compete with others. That’s a fair choice.

Related to ownership percentages is the area of valuation. That is, what is a com-
pany  worth  when  someone  invests  in  it?  There  are  at  least  four  well  recognized
ways to calculate valuation. But perhaps the most powerful is the negotiating posi-
tion of the parties. If VC owned firms are allowed to compete for SBIR, it will mean
that  VCs  can  demand  and  get  a  larger  percentage  ownership  for  the  same  invest-
ment  dollars.  This  lowers  the  valuation,  and  in  effect  devalues  the  contribution  of
the founders.

Finally,  there  is  the  practical  the  issue  of  where  VCs  are  putting  their  money  in
biotechnology.  For  the  past  few  years,  virtually  no  VC  investment  went  into  early
or  seed  stage  bio  companies.  Why?  Because  the  risks  are  higher  than  investing  in
later  stage  companies.  Indeed,  many  of  the  later  stage  investments  became  attrac-
tive  BECAUSE  they  obtained  SBIR  funding,  not  the  other  way  around.  Factually,
the  VCs  are  only  a  small  percentage  of  early  and  seed  stage  bio  funding.  Most  of
the  early  stage  funding  comes  from  angels  and  from  corporate-strategic  alliances.
And  most  of  these  deals  do  not  have  the  investor  taking  control  of  the  small  busi-
ness. Again, this is consistent with the long standing policy of giving small bio com-
panies a chance to prove their value to become attractive to investors, not the other
way around.

To summarize, there is a large Olympic-sized adult swimming pool of federal dol-
lars for every company in the U.S. This pool funds innovations in science and tech-
nology, and organizations such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Cal Tech, Boeing, Lock-
heed-Martin  and  IBM  have  been  able  to  develop  innovations  with  this  funding.
However,  Congress  realized  that  the  small  companies,  the  early  stage  companies
have  trouble  getting  funding  in  this  pool.  So  Congress  created  a  wading  pool  called
the  SBIR  program.  Small  companies  in  this  pool  compete  against  other  small  com-
panies.

The  VC  backed  firms  are  teenagers  who  don’t  like  swimming  in  the  adult  pool.
So they want the rules changed so they can get into the wading pool with the little
guys, who will be forced out.

Since  it  is  well  documented  that  a  substantial  source  of  America’s  innovation
comes  from  these  start-up  small  businesses,  permitting  venture  backed  companies
to siphon off SBIR funds will, in my opinion, erode America’s competitive technology
position in the world.

Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR FREDRIC D. ABRAMSON

Dr.  Abramson  is  taking  the  lead  in  developing  genetic-information  based  con-
sumer  products  to  improve  the  lives  of  ordinary  people.  He  comes  to  this  emerging
field,  which  he  calls  Directive  Genomics,  with  four  decades  experience  in  a  broad
variety  of  business,  scientific  and  educational  activities.  These  range  from  devel-
oping advanced computer software that reduced hospital-acquired infections to oper-
ations  &  marketing  in  the  recording  industry.  His  scientific  work  included  devel-
oping a computerized tracking system to deal with Dengue Fever in the Caribbean,
demonstrating  that  women  can  produce  antibodies  to  synthetic  steroids,  and  ana-
lyzing  over  half-million  pregnancy  outcomes  to  show  that  roughly  75  percent  of  all
human  pregnancies  result  in  a  spontaneous  fetal  death.  He  worked  on  federal  and
state policy, including U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare Secretary
Joseph Califano’s national policy review of alcohol abuse programs, the Nuclear Reg-
ulatory  Commission’s  measure  of  inspector  objectivity,  a  policy  analysis  of  future
technology  in  emergency  medical  services  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transpor-
tation,  scientific  experiment  selection  for  NASA’s  Spacelab,  and  Chaired  the  Mary-
land Governor’s Commission on Workers Compensation Laws.

His  business  activities  include  founding  the  Association  for  Medical  Emergency
Informatics,  Inc.  (publisher—U.S.  DOT  emergency  medical  services  training  mate-
rials),  United  Software  Associates,  Inc.  (publishing  European  source  computer  soft-
ware  in  the  American  market),  and  the  Fit  America  Research  Center  (research  on
weight  loss).  His  work  experience  additionally  includes  retail  sales,  wholesale  dis-
tribution, rock and roll show promotion, manufacturing of sheepskin seat covers for
sports cars and industrial elastomer products.

Dr.  Abramson  is  recognized  as  a  gifted  teacher  and  lecturer,  and  was  named
Teacher of the Year in the Johns Hopkins Master’s program in biotechnology, where
he teaches courses in the economics of biotechnology, creating the biotechnology en-
terprise, financial development, and legal aspects of biotechnology. He also is an ad-
junct  in  the  Hopkins  graduate  program  in  information  technology.  He  previously
held full-time academic appointments at the University of Kentucky Medical School
(Assistant Professor of Community Medicine) where he founded and directed the Re-
search  Design  Biostatistics  Laboratory,  and  the  American  University,  Washington,
D.C.  (Associate  Professor  of  Management)  where  he  taught  business  strategy  and
organization development. He taught MBA students as an adjunct in the Executive
Program  at  Loyola  College  in  Baltimore  and  the  Georgetown  University  School  of
Business.

Dr. Abramson holds his Ph.D. in human genetics from the University of Michigan
(1972)  and  a  Master  of  Science  in  Management  from  MIT  (1977)  where  he  was  an
Alfred  P.  Sloan  Fellow.  He  also  received  degrees  from  the  University  of  Pennsyl-

1965),  and  the  American  University  Washington  College  of  Law  (J.D.,  1987).  He  is
admitted  to  the  bars  of  Maryland  and  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  to  practice  be-
fore the United States Supreme Court and the United States Patent Office.

DISCUSSION

Chairman EHLERS. Thank you all very much for your comments.
I—when  I  walked  in,  I  was  happy  to  see  you  all  engaged  in  vig-
orous conversation with each other. Perhaps we should just appoint
you to go to another corner and resolve the problem and come back.
But while sitting here, I have generated a half-dozen ideas of my
own  about  what  we  might  do.  I  will  not  announce  those  at  this
time, but I certainly appreciate your stimulating testimony.

I  apologize  that  I  have  to  leave  for  another  meeting,  and  nor-
mally, I would never do that when I am chairing a committee, but
in  this  case,  we  are  trying  to  solve  the  pension  problems,  which  of
course,  as  Mr.  Baird  says,  we  will  never  see  me  again.  But  I  cer-
tainly appreciate your testimony, in case I am not back before you
leave.  Thank  you  very,  very  much  for  coming,  and  you  have  made
a major contribution to the discussion.

With  that,  I  am  pleased  to  turn  over  the  chair  to  Dr.  Schwarz,
who  was  a  practicing  physician  for  many  years,  and  since  most  of
you  talked  about  life  sciences,  he  is  eminently  suited  to  chair  the
remainder of the meeting.

Thank you.
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  [Presiding]  The  gentleman  from  Oregon,  Mr.  Wu.
Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I  was  reading  these  summaries,  and  I  am  in  the  process  of  ask-
ing for the statute. Well, I have requested the statute, but it hasn’t
come  yet,  and  it  seems  to  me  that  asking  some  questions  of  first
impression might help here, or at least might help me, and that is
when  I  looked  at  the  language  of  some  of  these  secondary  mate-
rials, this requirement about the recipient being a citizen or a resi-
dent,  which  has  subsequently  been  interpreted  to  require  a  real
person,  other  than  an  entity,  that  seems  to  be  a  drafting  error
more than anything else. I mean, that seems to be the kind of lan-
guage  that  Congress  typically  inserts  to  say  we  want  an  American
to  be  doing  this,  and  the  unintended  consequence  is  that  it  has
been  interpreted  to  mean  a  natural  person  and  exclude  institu-
tions.

Do you all have any comments on that? Dr. Cohen.
Dr.  RON COHEN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Wu.  I  would  support  that  en-
tirely. It seems, just historically, that the intent was to ensure ma-
jority  ownership  by  American  entities,  American  people.  With  re-
spect  to  venture  capitalists,  having  dealt  with  35  venture  capital-
ists  in  my  company,  I  will  tell  you,  I  am  not  sure  I  understand
what the argument is about, because after all, what is venture cap-
ital?  A  venture  capital  firm  is  a  bunch  of  limited  partners,  it  is  a
partnership,  of  people  with  high  net  worth,  and  also  institutions,
such as pension funds and 401Ks and so on, who pool their money
for  the  purpose  of  investing  in  high  risk,  potentially  high  reward
endeavors.  So,  it  does  represent  American  individuals  in  a  very
real sense.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  Dr.  Cohen,  you  will  forgive  me  if  I  truncate  your
answer.  I  take  that  as  a  yes,  you  agree,  and  thank  you,  and  that
others might not. I would be interested in hearing your perspective.
Mr.  JONATHAN COHEN.  I  have  a  very  different  perspective,  if  I
may.  I  can’t  comment  on  what  the  original  intent  of  Congress  was
in using this——

Mr.  WU.  But  that  is  what  I  am  going  to,  what  Congress  drafted
in 1982, or passed in 1982, probably drafted between, I don’t know,
’80, ’82, ’79, ’82, however long it was worked on.

Mr. JONATHAN COHEN. I suspect they were deliberate when they
used the term individuals, because—and I don’t think this is split-
ting legal hairs. I believe there is a profound difference between an
individual,  a  living,  breathing  person,  and  a  pension  fund.  And  let
me  give  you,  if  I  may,  just  one  concrete  example.  There  is  an
emerging  trend,  and  I  cited  an  article  from  Business  Week,  and
that  I  entered  into  the  record,  a  very  encouraging  trend  in  bio-
technology  the  last  few  years  is  there  is  an  increased  interest  on
the part of angel investors, particularly what are called disease an-
gels,  in  other  words,  people  that  invest  in  startup  biotech  compa-
nies, in part for return for investment.

Mr.  WU.  Mr.  Cohen,  I  understand  that.  I  understand  that,  but
if  that  is  the  case,  how  do  you  account  for  interpretation  between
1982 and 2003 when venture capital funds were included? It wasn’t
until 2003 that VC funds were excluded, at least that is my under-
standing.

Mr. JONATHAN COHEN. I suspect it was an oversight.
Mr.  WU.  This  is  a  matter  of  statutory  interpretation.  There
seems  to  have  been  a  21-year  period  when  it  was  interpreted  an-
other way.

Mr.  JONATHAN COHEN.  I  think  it  was—I  suspect,  and  I  am  not
sure,  but  I  suspect  it  was  an  oversight,  and  nobody  had  asked  for,
perhaps  no  one  had  asked  the  SBA  for  an  interpretation.  What
happens with a lot of these, when we get the grants, we are asked
to  check  a  box.  And  a  lot  of  entrepreneurs  perhaps  check  the  box,
and  didn’t  consult  with  counsel,  and  perhaps  over  the  years,  there
were recipients of SBIR that were, in fact, ineligible. That does not,
in  my  view,  mean  that  that  is  the  way  it  should  be  in  perpetuity.
I think the program has grown, and also, as the amount of venture
capital has gone down, that perhaps demands on the program have
gone  up,  and  this  has  gone  to  the  forefront,  but  I  suspect  that  the
term  ‘‘individual’’  was  a  deliberate  one,  and  in  hindsight,  it  is  an
appropriate  one.  And  a  company  that  is  individually  owned  is  dif-
ferent than——

Mr.  WU.  My  light  has  turned  yellow  here,  so—and  you  will  for-

give me——

Mr. SCHWARZ. Mr. Wu, the Chair will be happy to grant you the

time you need to continue your questioning.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  and  Dr.  Abramson,  when
you  said  let  us  stick  with  the  original  rules,  I  mean,  the  original
rules seem to be the way that they were interpreted from ’82 to ’93.
And  then,  there  is  this  change  from  ’93,  I  am  sorry,  2003  to  now,
and  so,  if  you  are  advocating  for  a  return  to  the  status  quo  ante,
it  seems  like,  you  know,  the  21  year  interpretation  seems  to  be  a
little bit more stable one.

comment.

Dr.  ABRAMSON.  I  would  say  that  there  was  no  prior  interpreta-
tion. I think no one interpreted it one way or the other. It was left
open,  with  the  assumption  that  somehow,  institutional  ownership
was  excluded.  It  would  be  obvious  if  Congress  created  a  carve-out
for  small  business,  and  the  small  business  could  be  owned,  by  a
majority, by an institution, a non-natural entity, it would, in effect,
eviscerate the purpose of creating the carve-out.

I would agree with Jonathan that what probably happened in no-
body raised the question, asked the question, because up until, cer-
tainly  from  the  ’80s  through  the  mid-90s,  the  role  of  venture  cap-
ital,  particularly  in  bio,  was  relatively  small.  I  mean,  Amgen  and
Genetech  go  back  into  the  ’80s,  but  we  are  talking  about  venture
capital  as  a  growth  industry  taking  place  in  the  ’90s.  It  appears
that  somewhere  along  the  line,  someone  said  wait  a  minute,  what
is the interpretation we should be using? And that is where the de-
finitive statement was made, well, this language would exclude the
VCs.  So,  in  our  view,  we  are  arguing  that  the  prior  interpretation
was  a  non-interpretation.  When  it  was  finally  asked,  the  interpre-
tation was natural person means natural person.

Mr.  WU.  Dr.  Eskesen,  it  seems  only  fair  to  give  you  a  chance  to

Dr.  NACY.  I  just—a  small  business  is  a  small  business.  I  am  17
person  business  at  the  end  of  my  venture  financing,  hopefully  at
the  end  of  this  summer,  I  will  be  a  17  person  business.  I  will  be
a small business. The venture capital money will not provide for a
research  program  in  my  organization.  I  am  still  a  small  business,
no  matter  what  the  venture  capitalists  have  invested  in  me,  it  is
a  small  business.  I  am  not  sure  I  understand  what  the  distinction
is between venture capital-backed companies and non-venture cap-
ital-backed companies who hope to be venture capital-backed.

Mr. JONATHAN COHEN. I just want to point out that there seems
to  be  an  awful  lot  of  energy  and  potentially  acrimony  poured  into
this  debate,  and  I  would  encourage  you  all  to  think  about  this  as
the pool is big enough for everybody. I mean, in 2003, we are look-
ing  at,  my  understanding  is,  what,  $1.7  billion,  and  in  the  current
fiscal year, we are looking at $2 billion or more, and this is up from
a  $44  million,  some  odd  dollar  figure  in  1982.  We  are  looking  at
a  1.2  percent  split  in  1982,  and  a  2.5  percent  split  today.  I  mean,
you  know,  when  I  was  dealing  with  the  technology  segment  of  our
economy,  you  know,  one  of  the  fundamentally  different  ways  of
looking  at  the  world  in  that  technology,  in  that  business  segment,
was  that  you  know,  if  you  grow  the  pie,  there  is  enough  room  for
everybody, and I guess I find an absence of that approach, at least
today,  and  I  hope  that  it  will  be  restored  at  some  point,  and  Mr.
Chairman,  I  thank  you  for  your  indulgence,  and  the  little  bit  of
extra time. Appreciate it.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Very  welcome.  The  gentleman  from  Washington,

Mr. Baird.

Mr. BAIRD. I thank the Chairman. I thank the witnesses, and my
distinguished  Ranking  Member,  as  well,  for  his  astute  comments,
insightful comments.

This  issue  was  brought  to  my  attention  by  a  company,  a  laser
company  in  my  district,  BioLasers,  world  leaders.  And  the  incred-
ible  capital  it  takes  to  do  some  of  these  things,  be  it  biotech,  be  it

lasers,  be  it  any  of  the  high  technology,  one  of  the  things  that  has
struck me is the enormous size of fiscal infrastructure, physical in-
frastructure we have to have to make very small things, and espe-
cially in high tech.

I  am  interested  in  your  experience,  in  terms  of  the  funding  you
need,  and  it  is  relevant,  because  to  say  that  we  want  innovation
in high technology areas, but we are going to exclude venture cap-
ital, it seems to me that you significantly exclude some of the high
capital  intensive  activities  that  we—that  may  generate  the  very
kind  of  innovations  and  create  the  jobs  we  hope  SBIR  will  do.  I
open that up to the panelists.

Ms.  ESKESEN.  If  I  could  respond,  sir,  to  go  back  to  the  question

that Mr. Wu posited, the——

Mr. BAIRD. Now, wait a second. You are going to have to answer

my question on my time. I mean——

Ms. ESKESEN. Well, I will, because I need to answer his in order

to answer—I need to answer his to——

Mr. BAIRD. I am just funning with you.
Ms.  ESKESEN.—answer  yours.  The  precipitating  action  that
caused  this  interpretation  to  occur  involved  a  company  in  Utah
who had a $16 million investment. They were ‘‘turned in’’ by a com-
petitor, who argued that they were not any longer a small firm be-
cause  they  were  majority  owned  by  a  venture  capital  community,
or  by  a  venture  capital  fund.  In  fact,  in  this  particular  case,  the
venture  capital  investment  was  90  percent  of  the  company  was
owned  for  that  $16  million.  And  the  point  is  a  very  basic  one,  and
it speaks directly to the issue that you are raising, sir.

We are not talking at all about excluding venture capital-funded
firms.  What  we  are  talking  about  fundamentally  is  the  value  that
that VC is placing on the company when they make that initial in-
vestment.  In  this  particular  instance,  the  person  who  negotiated
the deal was actually very proud of himself.

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  am  going  to  cut  you  off  there.  I  think  you  raised
a  good  point.  My  question,  more  broadly  speaking,  is  a  general
question  about  the  amount  of  capital  that  is  involved,  either  for  a
Stage III type clinical trial, or other kinds of innovation, so that we
get  a  general  sense,  because  let  us  say  we  are  talking  50  percent
of $5 million. $5 million in this town isn’t all that much, but if you
are a business, it is a lot of money. But it is a hell of a lot of money
when we are talking 50 percent of $60 million or $100 million, be-
cause some of the factories and plants you need to do some of this
research are expensive, for a Stage III clinical trial.

I am going to ask Dr. Cohen or Dr. Nacy to talk a little bit about

the kind of capital intensive activities you are involved in.

Dr.  RON COHEN.  Thanks  very  much.  It  currently  is  estimated
that  the  cost  for  the  average  drug  to  develop  from  the  laboratory
bench  to  the  patient’s  bedside  is  on  average,  about  $1  billion  from
beginning  to  end.  Now,  I  grant  you  that  that  takes  all  comers,  in-
cluding  the  big  pharmaceutical  industries,  and  it  includes  a  lot  of
overhead  costs  and  so  on.  But  even  under  the  best  of  cir-
cumstances,  within  the  biotech  industry  itself,  it  is  a  minimum  of
$300  million,  $250  to  $300  million,  and  often  $400  or  $500  million
to  get  to  the  point  where  you  have  a  success,  if  in  fact,  you  ever
have a success.

Mr. BAIRD. So in effect, if we—to the extent that we reduce ven-
ture  caps  percentage,  and  mind  you,  in  the  bill  we  are  talking
about, no single venture cap firm could own more than 50 percent.
A  consortium  could,  or  an  amalgam  could,  maybe  better  put.  But
the  point  is,  if  you  exclude  venture  cap,  where  do  you  get  the  rest
of  the  money  to  do  this  kind  of  operation?  Are  you  not,  de  facto,
excluding  certain  areas  of  technology  or  certain  kinds  of  research
if you say that venture cap can’t be more than 50 percent, because
where else do you get that kind of money?
Dr. NACY. That is—may I speak to that?
Mr. BAIRD. Please.
Dr. NACY. I just want to ask anybody who is sitting on the com-
mittee  whether  they  would  want  to  give  Carol  Nacy  and  Sequella
$30 million and not have any control over the way I use my money.
In  the  SBIR  program,  we  are  controlled  over  how  we  use  our
money.  We  apply—we  have  to  meet  certain  milestones,  and  it  has
to  be  on  the  product  that  we  applied  for.  Venture  capital  has  the
same  requirements,  and  they  want  to  make  sure  if  they  put  $30
million into my company that I am using that $30 million the way
they like it, and it is in clinical trials, and in late stage product re-
search.  It  is  not  in  the  early,  innovative  stages  of  a  high  risk  ven-
ture that one in 5,000 might end up at registration.

So,  when  we  talk  about  51  percent  control,  51  percent  control  is
simply  to  make  sure  that  their  money  is  used  by  my  company  in
an  appropriate  way.  They  don’t  have  control  of  the  company,  nec-
essarily.  They  have  control  of  the  stock,  and  they  can  vote  at  the
stockholder’s  meeting.  But  the  way  we  structure  our  boards,  we
have  control  of  our  companies.  They  have  a  lot  of  say  in  the  com-
pany,  because  they  have  one  or  two  or  three  board  members  of  a
total, but they don’t have the majority board members.

Mr. BAIRD. That is a helpful way——
Dr.  NACY.  So  they  have  control  of  the  company,  and—but  they
want  to  control  the  money,  so  their  shareholder  ownership  is  in  a
majority ownership, so that if we should make a very bad decision
on  how  to  use  their  money,  they  can  reverse  that  at  the  share-
holder meeting.

Mr. BAIRD. Dr.—Mr. Cohen or Dr. Abramson, what is wrong with

my reasoning?

Dr.  ABRAMSON.  The  issue  is  not  whether  there  is  valuable  re-
search being done by the companies that are here, or other compa-
nies  in  biotech,  or  that  they  shouldn’t  be  funded.  Certainly,  there
is  a  phenomenal  amount  of  ongoing  research  that  has  potentially
incredible benefits coming out of the pipeline.

The issue here is where the starting point is for innovation, and
how  do  we  support  that.  In  the  technology  incubator  that  I  am  lo-
cated in, and——

Mr.  BAIRD.  Let  me—but  my  question  is,  let  us  suppose  you  are
in an industry where—but the nature of the industry is hugely cap-
ital-intensive, and so you cannot do the innovation in that industry
without  the  capital  for  the  machinery.  I  mean,  just  get  a  chip——
Dr.  ABRAMSON.  It  is  not  a  question  of  doing  innovation.  It  is  a
question  of  commercializing  innovation.  The  innovation  of  discov-
ering  a  drug  takes  place  in  the  early  stage.  The  Phase  II,  Phase
III  clinical  trials  are  devoted  to  validating  and  ensuring  that  the

drug is safe and effective, and can be used by the public. The inno-
vation has already taken place in the discovery and research stage.
So,  the  purpose  of  SBIR  is  to  stimulate  the  very  early  stage,
when the idea is generated in the scientist’s mind, and needs to get
to the bench to be proven. Now, in the incubator we are located in,
there  are  about  20  bio  companies.  Only  about  a  third  of  them  are
able  to  successfully  compete  for  SBIR  money.  That  means  two
thirds  are  not.  Now,  either  the  two  thirds  of  those  scientists  are
just  cosmically  stupid,  and  investing  their  time  on  things  that  are
bad  ideas,  or  the  pool  of  money  that  Mr.  Wu  talked  about  isn’t
large enough to sustain that level of innovation. So, people working
on eye research or cancer research or other areas that may be inno-
vative,  but  can’t  be  funded  today,  with  the  existing  pool,  would
have  a  greater  difficulty  in  getting  funded.  Now,  once  an  SBIR
takes  place,  and  I  have  proven  my  idea,  and  I  have  proven  the
basic  science,  and  I  go  to  Phase  II,  and  I  get  some  ability  to  take
it  to  the  next  level,  at  that  point,  it  is  incumbent  on  me  to  go  out
to  the  community,  the  funding  community,  which  includes  VCs,
other  corporations,  whatever,  to  raise  the  funds  necessary  to  take
it to market.

Human Genome Sciences, the very famous company in our area,
is  now  taking  the  drugs  it  is  developing  and  teaming  with  large
pharma  companies  to  take  it  to  market.  Human  Genome  Sciences
raised $2 billion. I would love to have $2 billion to work with. But
the fact is, you are absolutely right——

Mr.  BAIRD.  But  they  are  now,  presumably  if  they  raised  it

through venture cap, they are ineligible for SBIR.

Dr.  ABRAMSON.  Well,  they  raised  it  publicly,  in  a  public  market.
They  have  gotten  products  to  a  point  where  they  can  start  testing
in  Phase  III,  but  in  order  to  lay  off  their  risk,  because  these  are
substantial risks, no question about it, they are teaming with larg-
er, even larger companies——

Mr.  BAIRD.  Why  is  a  public  offering  more  sacrosanct  than  ven-

ture cap?

Dr. ABRAMSON. I am not sure it is.
Dr. NACY. It is a series staged way of funding your company.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Yeah.  That  is  what  I  understand.  My  question  is  if
our goal—look, my goal is to innovate, create jobs, and inspire com-
petition.  And  that  is  my  focus,  and  to  the  extent  that  we  nitpick
on  some  of  the  other  elements,  I  think  we  have  lost  focus.  Dr.—
or Mr. Cohen, I wanted to ask you.

Mr.  JONATHAN COHEN.  Yeah,  and  I  share  those  goals.  But  I  do
not  believe  the  pool  is  currently  big  enough.  The  pay  lines  have
gone up, the bar has been raised. The last few years, and last year,
particularly,  it  has  been  harder  to  get  SBIR  funding,  and  Frederic
and  I  are  in  the  same  facility.  I  have  seen  over  the  last  few  years
a lot of companies, a lot of good companies, go under. And that pool
is going to get an awful lot smaller if H.R. 2943 is passed as writ-
ten,  because  by  my  back  of  the  envelope  calculations,  about  80  to
90 percent of the biotech industry would be eligible for this slender
2.5 percent of the pie.

It will hurt innovation, in my view.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Thank  you.  I  had  further  questions,  but  I  will  yield

back.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Baird.  Mr.  Miller,  the  gentleman

60

from North Carolina.

Mr. MILLER. Thank you. I am reminded of the old line about uni-
versity faculty politics, that the reason faculty politics are so bitter
is  that  the  stakes  are  so  small.  It  does  seem  that  the  reason  that
this  debate  is  so  vigorous,  I  won’t  say  bitter,  is  because  we  are
doing  so  little  to  help  companies  through  the  valley  of  death,  to
help that very expensive, high risk effort to get ideas from research
all the way into the marketplace.

Mr.  Cohen,  Jonathan  Cohen,  made  that  point  in  his  testimony,
and pointed to a couple of models, ATPR being one of them, excuse
me,  ATP  being  one  of  them,  which  is  a  source  of  patient  capital.
What  do  you  all  think,  do  you  all  think  we  are  doing  enough,  and
what  else  can  we  do  to  try  to  get  research-based  products  into  the
marketplace  through  this  very  tortured  process,  tortured  and  ex-
pensive?

Dr.  ABRAMSON.  If  I  may  comment,  I  think  two—several  things.
One,  for  example,  the  ATP  program.  Congress  has  repeatedly  un-
funded—I  think  it  is  funded  this  year  only  for  ongoing  programs.
There is no new money. So, Congress can stimulate this innovation
in  these  high  risk  areas  by  funding  things  like  ATP.  That  would
be one thing.

Another  is,  and  Dr.  Nacy  is  correct,  in  part,  that  the  culture  of
NIH  is  very  academic  oriented,  and  not  oriented  towards  transfer-
ring  the  benefits  of  research  into  the  mainstream,  and  delivering
it.  And  so,  to  the  extent  Congress  can  help  shape  the  NIH  culture
to allow companies like Sequella to compete for the 97.5 percent of
the  funds  with  Yale  and  Harvard  and  Hopkins,  so  that  they  can
take these products into the marketplace, that would be invaluable.

Mr. MILLER. I am sorry. Say that again.
Dr.  ABRAMSON.  The  companies  represented  here,  for  example,
should be able to compete at NIH for funding to get their products
through  Phase  I,  Phase  II,  and  Phase  III  clinical  trials,  which  are
very  expensive.  Jonathan  mentioned  a  program,  of  a  shared  pro-
gram to lower the risk, lower the costs. More work needs to be done
to  get  the  funds  necessary.  It  is  really  unfair  for  a  company  the
size of Dr. Nacy’s to have to try to figure out how to raise $100 mil-
lion to deliver something with the value of the solution she is work-
ing on.

This  is  precisely  the  role  of  where  the  Federal  Government  and

its resources can make selective choices to help us all.

Dr. RON COHEN. I am going to differ, and say that it is absolutely
right  and  proper  that  Dr.  Nacy’s  company  or  mine,  or  any  of  ours,
be compelled to compete for the funding we get, based on the mer-
its  of  what  we  have  to  offer  to  society.  That  is  the  system  I  grew
up  with,  and  I  love  that  system.  And  I  am  willing  to  throw  in  my
lot with that system.

As  to  your  question  about  are  we  doing  enough,  I  can’t  answer
that,  because  really,  at  the  bottom,  it  seems  to  me  it  is  a  question
of  what  is  society  interested  in  investing  for  its  future  well-being.
So, how much does our society want to invest, and I draw a distinc-
tion  between  invest  and  handouts  or  charity.  Because  in  a  real
sense, I think the SBIR has been one of the most successful of our
government’s programs precisely because it is an investment based

on  competitive  grant  reviews  by  some  of  the  leading  scientific
minds  in  the  world  of  the  various  grants  that  come  in.  And  those
grants  that  get  funded  have  passed  through  that  gauntlet  success-
fully, and have been deemed meritorious, and one sees the results.
Ms.  Eskesen  quoted  some  figures  earlier,  where  companies  that
have gotten SBIR grants have gotten venture capital investment at
10  to  one  ratio.  Well,  that  alone  tells  you  that  this  has  been  suc-
cessful, because of all the jobs that are created, the technology that
has been advanced, and generally, the contribution to the common-
wealth.  So,  I  don’t  know  if  we  are  doing  enough  or  not.  I  don’t
know what that magic number is, but I will tell you that I am well
satisfied with the way the SBIR program is administered.

Could  we  use  more  funding?  Sure.  If  you  ask  me  as  an  entre-
preneur,  I  will  always  say  sure,  we  would  love  to  have  a  bigger
pool,  and  to  promote  more  innovation.  But  at  some  point,  you  do
wind  up  with  a  lowering  of  the  overall  quality,  right,  so  the  more
competitive  the  grant  process,  the  higher  the  quality  of  what  you
get out.

Mr.  MILLER.  There  are  several  kind  of  fingers  raised  to  speak,
but  Dr.  Cohen,  I  don’t  think  anyone  is  suggesting,  I  am  certainly
not  suggesting,  that  we  set  aside  a  substantial  amount  of  money,
simply  ring  a  dinner  bell,  and  say  who  wants  some  money,  we  got
some.

Dr. NACY. But if you did that, we would be there.
Mr.  MILLER.  Everyone  here  would  be—everyone  in  the  room

would be, yes. And everyone in America. Yes.

Ms.  ESKESEN.  In  my  written  testimony,  I  made  the  point  that
there  is  a  profile  that  a  company  has  to  present  in  order  to  be  of
interest  to  a  venture  capitalist,  and  that  profile  is  a  large  market
potential,  and  the  significant  likelihood  within  a  relatively  short
time  framework  of  a  liquidity  event,  an  IPO  or  an  M&A.  I  think
you  have  to  recognize  there  is  a  big  percentage  of  SBIR  involved
companies  who  will  never  be  eligible  for  venture  capital,  because
they don’t fit that profile.

And  a  major  concern  to  me,  that  is  really  rolled  into  this  VC
issue, is that we have a serious deficit of the availability of transi-
tional funding for the development of technology. We have very ef-
fectively, through the extreme competitiveness of SBIR, created the
funding for the research and for the development. We have not cre-
ated  that  second  D,  which  is  the  demonstration  of  the  technology,
which  is  often  necessary  for  it  subsequently,  then,  to  make  it  to
commercial condition.

For those companies that have VC eligibility, they are often able
to use part of that money to transition. But even if we resolve this
divisive issue, we are still left with the very basic problem of where
does the capital come from that will enable the companies who are
not  VC  eligible,  and  it  is  a  lot  of  firms.  Our  estimates  are  that  we
are looking at—we have 47,000 issued patents in the SBIR commu-
nity. If you look at that that have some potential market, could be
being  used,  our  estimates  are  that  it  is  worth  somewhere  $50  and
$60 billion, but the vast majority of it at this point is sitting on the
shelves,  because  the  resources  that  are  required  to  transition  that
technology  are  not  there.  The  problem  is  far  more  fundamental,  it
seems to me, than just the availability of venture capital.

Mr. MILLER. If the Chair is being reasonably forgiving——
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  The  Chair  is  being  more  than  reasonably  for-

giving, so please continue, Mr. Miller.

Mr. MILLER. Mr. Cohen, I think you had your——
Mr.  JONATHAN COHEN.  Thank  you,  and  Representative  Miller,  I
think  you  have  really  put  your  finger  on  the  core  issue  here.  We
in the biotech sphere are clearly not doing enough.

We  are  not  doing  enough,  because  we  are  not  making  sufficient
progress  in  the  war  on  cancer.  We  are  not  developing  counter-
measures  to  bioterrorism  fast  enough,  and  I  believe  if  there  is  one
message  that  I  am  hearing  from  this  testimony  today,  and  from
this panel, is that there is a need for something new.

We  need  a  new  program,  particularly  at  the  NIH,  although  it
could  cross  into  other  agencies,  such  as  NIST,  to  fund  high  risk,
high  impact  technology  development,  not  basic  research,  but  tech-
nology  development,  that  companies  of  all  shapes  and  sizes,  and
universities, and federal agencies, for that matter, can compete for,
that  can  help  us  move  research  to  patients,  and  put  products  into
the strategic national stockpile.

I  have  been  giving  this  quite  a  bit  of  thought,  and  I  would  be
happy  to  reconvene  with  you  or  your  staff,  but  I  do  think  ATP  is
a very good starting point. And I regret that the program is not en-
tirely  popular  with  all  of  the  Members  of  Congress.  I  think  that  is
regrettable,  but  what  is  important,  I  think,  about  that  program,
and where it differs from SBIR is it contemplates companies of dif-
ferent  sizes,  and  it  has  different  levels  of  matching  funds.  So,  it
may very well be that a large company or a medium sized company
should  get  federal  support,  but  we  might  ask,  in  that  case,  for  ex-
ample,  some  level  of  match  from  their  investors.  That—this  goes,
perhaps, beyond the scope of the hearing today, but I would strong-
ly  encourage  this  committee  and  this  Congress  to  continue  to  look
at  that  issue,  because  from  my  perspective,  the  stakes  couldn’t  be
higher.

Mr. MILLER. Go ahead, sir.
Dr.  RON COHEN.  You  know,  this  is,  perhaps  a  happy  milestone,
because I find that Mr. Cohen and I are in complete agreement on
this point.

I  would  like  to  just  amend  my  earlier  response,  and  say  that
while  I  cannot  comment,  myself,  on  what  is  the  appropriate  level
of  investment,  certainly  some  sort  of  panel  or  study  might  be  con-
vened to look at that question, but I will say that in fact, currently
97.5  percent  of  the  NIH  budget  is  allocated  for  what  is  called  hy-
pothesis-driven research, very important, basic, discovery research.
2.5 percent is allocated for applied research or practical drug devel-
opment, or other technology development from that research.

It is an interesting question as to whether that is the right ratio
there,  and  it  is  an  interesting  question  that  Mr.  Cohen  raises  as
to whether there is a series of funding vehicles that one could cre-
ate to invest at different stages of development. So SBIR for proof-
of-principle, let us say an ATP-like program, which we did get one
ATP  grant,  so  I  am  well  familiar  with  it,  to  get  it  the  next  step  of
the way.

Mr. MILLER. Chairman, just one more.
Mr. SCHWARZ. Okay.

Mr.  MILLER.  Given  the  chair’s  extreme  indulgence.  Early  on,  I
am  in  my  second  term  now,  but  early  on,  I  met  with  folks  from
Duke University, which I think is some measure of what I am will-
ing  to  do  to  serve  in  Congress,  and  they  said  that  they  were—the
sacrifices  that  I  am  willing  to  make.  They  said  that  Bayh-Dole
worked  great.  Bayh-Dole  worked  great.  They  had  lots  of  patent
lawyers  on  staff.  They  immediately  got  patent  protection  for  any
ideas  coming  out  of  their  research.  They  had  the  pipeline  estab-
lished. They could get products to what you call the liquidity event.
And  it  was  working  great,  and  the  profits  that  came  from  those
products  that  had  made  their  way  to  the  marketplace  was  going
back to fund that whole stream, that whole pipeline.

I  then  talked  to  folks  from  smaller  universities,  less  well  en-
dowed  universities.  North  Carolina  A&T,  an  historically  black  col-
lege  or  university  in  Greensboro,  but  also,  a  research  university.
University of North Carolina, Greensboro, much less well endowed
than  Duke  University,  but  also,  a  research  university.  They  said
yeah,  Bayh-Dole  is  working  great  for  Duke.  It  is  not  working  for
us  at  all.  We  can’t  get  products  from  research  to  a  liquidity  event.
We can’t—we don’t have the funds to establish the pipeline.

Is that your own experience as well, particularly for smaller—Dr.
Abramson, I think you distinguished Harvard from—or some other
similar  university  from  other  universities  doing  research.  Any
thoughts on that topic, Dr. Nacy?

Dr.  NACY.  I  think  it  is  very  difficult  to  educate  scientists  as  to
what is a product and what isn’t a product, and I am 30 years into
my  scientific  career.  I  am  an  actual  scientist  who  went  into  busi-
ness  12  years  ago.  It  is  hard.  Smaller  universities  do  have  a  dif-
ficult  time  getting  reasonable  patents  written,  and  supporting
those  patents  until  somebody  comes  along  and  says  yes,  we  can
commercialize this. And even if they say yes, it is usually a startup
company  like  mine,  in  which  I  like  to  have  all  my  technologies
come  in  with  no  costs  to  me,  because  I  have  no  money  to  pay  for
them. So, I can put everything that I have in the way of money into
their development.

Universities  need  some  upfront  payments,  and  this  is—it  is  a
very  cumbersome  system  that  we  have  in  the  United  States  right
now.  I,  for  18  years,  was  at  Walter  Reed  Army  Institute  of  Re-
search.  I  hated  the  Bayh-Dole  Act  when  I  was  there.  It  created
problems  with  collaborations  with  the  NIH  and  with  other  people.
I  am  now  on  the  other  side  of  the  story.  I  love  it  in  one  sense,
and I am frustrated by it in another, because I think young univer-
sities  or  small  universities,  whether  they  are  research  or  not,  are
never going to have the right kind of resources to provide the right
kind of advice to their scientists and their patent attorneys to actu-
ally get commercialized product.

By  the  way,  may  I  just  mention  one  more  thing.  Not  all  science

is good, and not all scientists are good.

Mr. MILLER. All right.
Dr.  NACY.  And  so,  not  all  science  should  be  funded,  and  that  is

why the competitive process is really so important.

Mr.  MILLER.  And  we  are  getting  back  to  the  dinner  bell  issue
again. I don’t think anyone wants to suggest that we have someone
ring  a  dinner  bell  and  say,  who  wants  money,  we  got  some.  That

they are—of course, there should be standards, and they should be
rigorous. But there were——

Mr. SCHWARZ. Go ahead.
Mr. MILLER. There were other hands. I just wanted to see if any-

body else wanted to address that.

Dr.  RON COHEN.  Yeah,  just  to  amplify,  indeed,  smaller  univer-
sities  have,  almost  by  definition,  less  research  going  on,  are  less
likely  to  come  up  with  the  sort  of  research  that  would  come  out  of
a  Harvard  or  a  Stanford  or  a  Duke,  which  is  not  to  say  that  they
won’t come up with meritorious research. It is a matter of just size
and  volume.  But  it  is  the  case  that  when  their  scientists  do  come
up  with  something  meritorious,  their 
is  not
equipped,  as  Duke  or  Harvard  would  be,  to  take  advantage  of  it.
And  what  does  that  mean?  That  means  having  the  technology
transfer  infrastructure  with  appropriate  business  and  legal  people,
first  of  all,  to  patent  the  discoveries  in  a  timely  way.  So,  you  need
to  have  that  knowledge  and  those  people,  and  the  money  to  do  it,
and  then,  to  have  the  connections  with  the  venture  capital  and
other funding communities and entrepreneurs to be able to go and
license  that  technology  to  them,  so  that  they  can  go  and  develop
it.  That  is  where  those  universities  have  difficulty,  because  they
just don’t have the funds and the infrastructure to take full advan-
tage of the discoveries that come out of their labs, even when they
do come out of their labs.

infrastructure 

Dr.  ABRAMSON.  Congressman,  if  I  may  add,  I  speak  to  the  eco-
nomic  development  people  around  the  country  on  a  regular  basis,
and there is an interesting thing happening right now, particularly
in  the  bio  field.  Regions  of  the  country  are  becoming  aware  of  the
need  to  build  their  own  ability  to  commercialize  biotechnology.  At
the  BIO  meeting  in  Philadelphia,  I  actually  talked  with  people
from North Carolina who talked about Research Triangle, but then
talked about areas outside of the Research Triangle that are work-
ing  to  develop  their  own  infrastructure  to  attract  technology,  but
also, to commercialize what is being done at other universities.

So,  I  would  have  to  say  that  what—the  points  here  are  correct,
but  what  is  happening  is  that  around  the  country,  people  are
aware,  more  and  more,  that  they  have  to  begin  developing  this.
And one of the things they do, interestingly enough, is they put on
small,  local  conferences  for  these  local  companies  from,  say,  Caro-
lina A&T, to get SBIR funding. And they do it, because these com-
panies  that  they  are  talking  to  are  early  stage  startups  without
many  resources,  coming  out  of  a  small  university,  not  a  whole  lot
of  local  capital,  maybe  some  angel  money.  And  they  are  talking  to
the—helping  them  to  compete  with  the  larger,  more  established
players.  So,  in  fact,  this  is  happening,  and  I  would  go  back  to  my
original point.

Having  the  rule  to  allow  the  larger  companies  come  in  would
make  it  more  difficult  for  these  smaller  areas  to  actually  develop
their infrastructure at all.

Mr.  MILLER.  Mr.  Chair,  I  am  going  to  ask  that  you  proceed——
Mr.  SCHWARZ.—Mr.  Wu,  who  I  believe  is  going  to  yield  to  the

gentleman from Washington, Mr. Baird.

Mr. WU. Yes. It is my intention to yield the majority of my time
to Mr. Baird, but first, I just wanted to—we have a key triangula-

tion on at least one issue, that Dr. Cohen, Mr. Cohen, and I all be-
lieve in the concept of leverage, and that the more leverage we get,
the  better  off  we  are.  I  am  glad  we  are  making  steps  forward  in
this. But it is good that we have achieved this. I am still somewhat
concerned about what statutory basis the Small Business Adminis-
tration  had  in  its  interpretation,  and  this  is  something  that  I  in-
tend to take up with counsel from the Small Business Administra-
tion, and see what kind of statutory basis they did have, and what
the language, precise language was, that—which was used in 1982.
I  have  been  perusing  the  statute,  and  thus  far,  have  found  little
statutory basis for their interpretation, but I remain educable.

And  forgive  me  for  being  hung  up  on  such  small  things,  but
something  else  I  heard  during  the  course  of  testimony  is  the  re-
peated  referral  to  award  sums  in  the  range  of  $1.5  to  $2  million,
and  it  is  my  read  of  the  statute  that  it  says  $100,000  in  Phase  I,
and  $750,000  in  Phase  II.  Do  you  all  know  how  NIH  is  achieving
a  larger  number,  when  the  statute,  at  least  on  its  face,  seems  to
state something different?

Dr.  NACY.  I  don’t  know  how  they  are  doing  it,  but  I  am  very
grateful that they are, because you can get almost nothing done for
$100,000 in biotech——

Mr.  WU.  I  understand.  We  are  talking  about  small  sums  of

money——

Dr. NACY. Don’t change that part.
Mr.  JONATHAN COHEN.  The  $100,000  is  for—up  for  Phase  I,  and
that  does  seem  to  obtain,  in  my  company’s  experience.  Phase  II,
there  are  some  grants  that  are  in  the  $700,000,  $750,000  range,
but  clearly,  there  are  some  that  are  between  $1  and  $2  million.  I
don’t  know  what  they  do  that  with  the  statute.  I  am  not  an
expert——

Mr.  WU.  Well,  I  am  all  in  favor  in  flexibility  in  interpretation,
and  achieving  what  innovation  needs,  but  we  need  some  level  of
statutory  compliance,  and  sometimes  returning  to  the  statute  and
revising  it  may  be  necessary.  I  am  just  concerned  that  we  live  in
an  era  when  our  Attorney  General,  when  he  was  counsel  to  the
President,  apparently  wrote  a  memo  that  the  President  doesn’t
need  to  follow  the  statutes  of  the  United  States,  but  I  am  getting
further  afield,  and  I  am  going  to  yield  the  balance  of  my  time  to
Mr. Baird.

Mr. SCHWARZ. Mr. Baird.
Mr. BAIRD. Thank you. I thank the Chair.
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  I  am  a  little  disappointed  that  I  am  not  hearing
more  about  Michigan  and  OU  and  UW  and  University  of  North
Carolina  here,  but  I  note  that  Dr.  Abramson  is  a  University  of
Michigan  graduate,  as  am  I.  So,  we  are  not  too  bad  out  there,  are
we?

Dr. ABRAMSON. No.
Mr. SCHWARZ. In fact, quite good.
Dr. ABRAMSON. Quite good.
Mr. SCHWARZ. Mr. Baird.
Mr. BAIRD. I thank the Chair. If I were to look at this issue more
broadly,  my  concerns  are  sort  of  in  three  parts.  One  is  the  issue
before us today, and I think it is appropriate that we focus on that.
That  has  to  do,  within  my  judgment,  the  need  to  expand,  or  actu-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

ally  not  expand,  maybe  return  to  the  eligibility  of  VC  based  firms
to  compete  with  SBIR.  The  other  two  sides  are  the  needs  that  you
have  just  articulated.  We  have,  in  fact,  with  legislative  staff  here,
have been working for the better part of a year now on essentially
establishing  a  Phase  III  element  of  the  SBIR  program  that  would
address some of these very concerns. Perhaps additional funding or
additional percentage, et cetera, but I think it is a point well taken.
So,  on  the  one  hand,  I  think  we  need  to,  in  my  judgment,  assure
that venture cap firms have access to this.

Second,  I  think  we  need  to  expand  and  create,  possibly,  this
Phase  III  element  to  actually  get  products  to  market.  The  other
side  to  the  coin,  and  I  would  like  some  commentary  on  that,  there
are also concerns, and I know Mr. Gutknecht and I have discussed
this. I can’t speak for him, but I know we have discussed the issue,
and you hear it out there, that there are companies that exist, basi-
cally  on  repetitive  SBIR  granting,  and  that  the  actuality  that  they
ever  bring  something  of  use  to  our  society  to  the  fore,  other  than
maybe  employing  a  few  people  for  the  short-term  until  their  next
SBIR  grant  is  funded,  that  is  out  there,  and  I  think  it  is  a  valid
concern, and I wonder if people could comment on that. Given that
we  have  a  finite  pool,  making  sure  that  people  who  are  going  to
compete for that pool actually do something worthwhile for society.

Dr. Nacy.
Dr. NACY. In the NIH program, which is where the biotech com-
panies generally look for their SBIR funds, if you have had a num-
ber  of  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  programs,  you  are  not  eligible  for  any
additional  SBIR  grants,  unless  you  have  commercialized  at  least
one product in the process.

And now, I am not sure that they tell you how many grants you
can get before you commercialize something, but they are now ask-
ing in Phase II grants for a commercialization scheme and a fund-
ing  scheme  that  is  associated  with  commercialization,  to  ensure
that we are compliant with that part of the regulation.

Mr.  BAIRD.  And  part  of  the  reason  I—earlier,  it  was  mentioned
that  it  is  getting  harder  to  get  SBIR  funding.  My  take  on  that  is
probably that is good, given these concerns I have heard.

Dr. ABRAMSON. And there are really two other issues here, which
really  are  related  to  the  issue  before  the  committee.  Scientists,  by
their nature, aren’t trained to be businesspeople, and programs like
MIT and Hopkins and so on, are working to transition the scientist
to  a  more  businesslike  mentality.  So,  many  of  the  people  who  re-
ceive  SBIR  awards 
just  don’t  have  the  acumen  and  the
knowledgebase  to  actually  take  it  through  the  steps  of  commer-
cialization. So——

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  think  that  is  a  good  point,  but  I  certainly  hear  of
people who have the acumen and knowledge to get SBIR funds, but
don’t actually have any intent but to chase SBIR funds repeatedly.
Dr.  ABRAMSON.  Well,  that  is  the  other  side—the  other  flipside.
There  is  also,  obviously,  there  are  what  you  might  call  boutique
kind  of  firms,  and  they  live  off  the  SBIR  funding.  But  there  is  an-
other element, which is also on the NIH side. The bulk of the NIH
review  still  takes  place  with  scientists  who  are  allied  with  aca-
demics or NIH. They themselves have very little experience in com-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

67

mercialization,  so  there  is  a  skewness  in  terms  of  what  really  is
commercializable or not.

Mr. BAIRD. A good point.
Dr. ABRAMSON. So, we end up with kind of a trap here.
Mr. BAIRD. Other comments on that?
Mr.  JONATHAN COHEN.  I  would  just  like  to  reiterate  Frederic’s
point.  I  think,  as  part  of  looking  at  this  whole  process  holistically,
we  really  do  need  to  look  at  the  NIH  process,  the  review  process.
And I do think that may, in part, contribute to what some perceive
as a poor commercialization rate on the part of companies.

We  also  have  some  funding  from  DOD,  although  it  is  not  SBIR
funding.  It  is  biodefense  funding,  and  it  is  striking  to  me  the  dif-
ference  between  the  DOD  and  NIH.  The  DOD  process  was  a  very
rigorous,  probably  a  more  competitive  process,  because  we  were
competing  against  the  Lockheed-Martins  of  the  world,  and  aca-
demia, and so forth. So, it was a rigorous process, but it was struc-
tured  in  a  way,  and  the  way  they  are  managing  that,  we  have
monthly reports, we have quarterly meetings. They want a deliver-
able.  They  are  managing  taxpayers’  money  toward  a  deliverable,
and  I  think  what  the  NIH  did  with  the  program,  at  least  from  my
observation,  is  they  basically  said—they  took  the  same  machinery
that  they  used  to  review  academic  grants—which  may  be  appro-
priate, I am not qualified to say—and applied it to businesses. And
it is a square peg in a round hole.

So,  I  think  we  need  to  take  a  fresh  look  at  that  review  process

to see if, in fact, it can be improved.

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  have  heard  very  similar  things  from  folks,  that
there  is  a  much  different  level  of  oversight  or  management,  de-
pending on which entity is providing the SBIR funding. Other final
comments before I yield back?

Dr.  RON COHEN.  I  would—I  have  heard  of  companies  of  the  sort
you describe, sort of chasing SBIR grants, but I don’t have the facts
and  figures.  It  would  be  interesting  to  see  if  it  is  anything  more
than  a  very,  very  tiny  minority  of  recipients,  which  is  what  I  sus-
pect it would be, and it is an issue, and should be addressed, prob-
ably,  separately.  But  overall,  it  occurs  to  me,  listening  here,  that
one of the things that was very impressive to me and my colleagues
in  the  ATP  grant  process,  and  I  realize  it  has  been  in  and  out  of
favor, but this is an element that was really quite compelling, was
that  in  a  40-page  grant,  about  20  pages  were  the  science  and  the
technology,  and  how  we  were  going  to  develop,  and  the  other  20
pages  were  a  business  plan.  And  when  the  grants  were  reviewed,
these are, you know, $2 million or up, they had people with indus-
try experience actually passing judgment on the business plan side
as  much  as  the  technology  people  were  passing  judgment  on  the
technology  side.  So,  when  you  got  the  grant,  what  that  said  was,
we  deem  this  to  be  not  only  scientifically  exciting  and  techno-
logically exciting, but also, that your team and your plan are suffi-
ciently  realistic  that  you  might  actually  get  this  to  market  and
prosper. Something that may be worth considering.

Mr.  BAIRD.  I  know  others  want  to  comment,  but  in  deference  to

my chair, I will yield back, unless he wants to allow that.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Why  don’t  you,  Mr.  Baird,  go  ahead  and  finish,
and  we  will  bring  it  to  a  close  when  you  finish  your  questioning.

Dr. NACY. I just want to say, just from the NIH perspective, that
the list of reviewers from my previous grants in the last two years
have  changed  dramatically.  We  now  have  a  lot  of  people  from  in-
dustry  on  those  committees  reviewing  the  grants.  So,  I  think  the
NIH recognized that they were getting a lot of academic——

Mr. BAIRD. So, there has been evolution in that.
Dr.  NACY.  There  is—it  is  an  evolving  process,  and  now,  I  would
say about 80 percent of the people are from industry, and it is im-
proving the comments that we get back as part of the review.

Mr. BAIRD. Ms. Eskesen.
Ms. ESKESEN. I have been involved in SBIR for a long time, and
this issue of the proposal mills is a myth and a fiction that has ab-
solutely  no  basis  in  fact,  and  really,  it  realistically  should  be  al-
lowed to die.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Well,  I  would  tell  you  that  people—I  would  dispute
that vigorously. I am familiar with people who have left SBIR mills
to  found  valid,  successful  companies,  and  I  have  100  percent  con-
fidence  in  the  veracity  of  their  personal  statements  and  personal
experience.  So,  it  may  not  be  as  rampant  as  some  may  assert,  but
I  have  personal  knowledge  of  people  who  have  worked  in  those
kind of settings that have received repeated SBIR funds, and have
never produced anything of substance, of use to the public. So, with
that, I will yield back the balance of my time.

Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Baird,  and  thank  you,
I  want  to  thank  the  panel  for  being  here.  I  do  not  have  any  ques-
tions, but I am very interested in, for instance, what you might be
doing,  Ms.  Eskesen,  with  Microbacteria  tuberculosis,  simply  be-
cause  I  lived  for  five  years,  I  am  sorry.  You  are  not  doing
anything——

Ms. ESKESEN. I am——
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  Yeah.  Yeah—not  to  your  knowledge.  But  I  am
very  interested  in  that,  having  lived  in  an  endemic  tuberculosis
area  for  five  years  in  Southeast  Asia,  and  with  a  tubercular  posi-
tive  rate  of  probably  about  70  percent,  where  I  was,  in  any  event.
And  also,  very  interested  in  what  Dr.  Cohen  is  doing  with  spinal
cord  and—I  will  ask  you  a  couple  of  questions  about  embryonic
stem  cells,  perhaps,  when  we  are  done  here  today,  having  been  a
very  strong  supporter  of  the  embryonic  stem  cell  bill,  which  just
passed the House and is now in the Senate, and being a physician
of now 41 years duration myself.

So  I  thank  all  of  you  for  being  here,  and  before  we  bring  the
hearing  to  a  close,  I  want  to  thank  our  panelists  for  testifying  be-
fore the Subcommittee. It has been a great hearing. The witnesses
have given the Committee a great deal to consider.

If there is no objection, the record will remain open for additional
statements  from  Members,  and  for  answers  to  any  follow-up  ques-
tions  the  Subcommittee  may  ask  the  panelists.  Without  objection,
so ordered.

The hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:40 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

These questions were submitted to the witness, but were not responded to by the

time of publication.

Q1. As a small business with less than 500 employees, or in your case less than 100
employees,  if  you  raise  a  round  of  venture  financing  would  you  say  that  all  of
your  fund-raising  needs  have  been  satisfied?  Are  you  able  to  pursue  all  of  the
projects  and  business  leads  you  would  like  to  pursue  with  this  venture  financ-
ing?

Q2. Given  the  10  to  15  years  of  work  and  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  it  takes
to complete testing and gain approval of a biotechnology therapy, venture capital
investment  is  often  a  necessity  for  many  biotechnology  companies.  If  bio-
technology companies receive venture capital for their research and development,
why is it necessary for these companies to also receive SBIR grants?

Q3. If a firm is more than 51 percent owned by one or more venture or institutional
investors,  would  you  consider  your  business  to  be  controlled  by  these  investors?
Q4. The SBA recently issued a Final Rule (69 Fed. Reg. 70180) that amended SBIR
eligibility requirements to allow grant awardees to be 51 percent owned and con-
trolled by another business, as long as the other business is itself at least 51 per-
cent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or per-
manent resident aliens in, the United States. Does this Final Rule solve the eli-
gibility concerns by VCC-backed biotechnology companies?

Q5. The  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA)  has  been  holding  a  series  of  Public
Hearings across the country to address two topics: (1) the restructuring of small
business  size  standards;  and  (2)  the  possible  participation  of  small  businesses
majority-owned by venture capital companies in the SBIR program. These hear-
ings follow the SBA’s announcement that they are considering whether an exclu-
sion  from  affiliation  rules  for  venture  capital  companies  (VCCs)  should  be  pro-
vided in size determinations for eligibility in the SBIR program. Would this ex-
clusion solve the eligibility concerns by VCC-backed biotechnology companies?

Q6. Aside  from  the  issue  today,  what  other  recommendations  would  you  make  on
how  the  SBIR  program  could  be  improved?  For  example  are  the  Phase  I  and
Phase II award levels sufficient? Also what are your thoughts on Phase III fund-
ing?

Q7. What  is  your  assessment  of  how  NIH  is  managing  its  SBIR  program?  What

could NIH do better?

Q8. What  is  your  response  to  those  who  say  that  changing  the  current  venture  cap-
ital  participation  rules  would  fundamentally  change  the  structure  of  the  SBIR
program?

Q9. What is your opinion of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP)?

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Jonathan Cohen, President and CEO, 20/20 Gene Systems, Inc.

Q1. If  a  firm  is  more  that  51  percent  owned  by  one  or  more  venture  or  institutional
investors,  would  you  consider  your  business  to  be  controlled  by  these  investors?
A1. Yes.  The  owners  of  a  company  have  ultimate  control  of  that  company  even  if
they choose to delegate some or all of that control to a hired CEO and management
team. Based on my experience VCs and other institutional shareholders usually del-
egate  day-to-day  operations  of  the  firm  to  the  management  team.  However,  if  the
company fails to meet the expectations of the owners, or the management team does
not have the full confidence of the owners, either the CEO is replaced or the owners
will begin to micro-manage some or all of the company operations.

In business controlling the majority of stock is equivalent to controlling the oper-
ations of the company. I base this opinion on my experience as in-house counsel for
two biotechnology companies that were owned and controlled by institutional inves-
tors.  This  is  so  even  in  the  case  of  syndicate  investing  by  multiple  VCs  wherein  no
one  VC  owns  a  majority  of  stock  but  they  do  so  collectively.  In  such  cases  one  or
more ‘‘lead’’ investors act on behalf of the syndicate.
Q2. Aside  from  the  issue  today,  what  other  recommendations  would  you  make  on
how  the  SBIR  program  can  be  improved?  For  example  are  the  Phase  I  and
Phase II award levels sufficient? Also what are your thoughts on Phase III fund-
ing?
What is your assessment of how the NIH is managing its SBIR program? What
could NIH do better?

A2. The NIH SBIR program is a critically important program but one in significant
need  of  improvement.  Weaknesses  of  the  program  may  be  summarized  as  follows:
• Favors  low-risk,  incremental  research  rather  than  highly  innovative  tech-

nology development that is a core competency of small tech companies.

• Relies almost entirely on university professors for review and scoring of grant
applications.  Typically  these  reviewers  lack  product  or  technology  develop-
ment expertise.

• Gives  too  much  weight  to  ‘‘grantsmanship’’  and  extensive  preliminary  data.
Gives too little weight to the innovation of the technology or the medical sig-
nificance  thereof,  or  the  track  record  of  the  management  team  in  bringing
products to market.

• The NIH mistakenly treats the 2.5 percent SBIR set-aside as a ceiling rather
than a floor. Even institutes that rely heavily on small companies to advance
their  mission  (e.g.,  the  new  Bioengineering  Institute  which  receives  30  per-
cent  of  its  grant  applications  from  small  businesses)  limit  their  SBIR  pool  to
2.5 percent.

• STTR  set  aside  of  0.3  percent  is  much  too  small  due  powerful  potential
synergies between small companies and nonprofit medical centers with access
to patients and patient samples.

• Since  NIH  staff  do  not  normally  participate  in  the  application  review  there
is no mechanism to obtain reliable feedback on the likelihood of success before
significant resources are invested in the application process.

• Phase I funding ($100,000) is too small for most biotech projects.
• Gap between Phase I and II can last years.

To remedy these shortcomings and improve the NIH SBIR program I would offer

the following recommendations:

1. Design  and  implement  an  NIH  SBIR  application  and  review  system
geared specifically for small businesses rather than universities. Re-
tain program managers with product/technology development exper-
tise  and  empower  them  to  help  guide  funding  determinations  and
manage ongoing projects.

The  NIH  SBIR  program  utilizes  the  same  review  committees  that  are  used  for
evaluating academic research programs. These reviewers tend to place undue weight
on good grant writing and preliminary data rather than the significance of the tech-
nology  and  the  applicant’s  ability  to  bring  needed  products  to  market.  The  Depart-
ment  of  Defense  SBIR  program  and  the  ATP  program  have  review  processes  more

appropriately  geared  to  commercialization  that  should  become  models  for  the  NIH
SBIR program.

One  odd  feature  of  the  NIH  SBIR  program  is  the  ‘‘Chinese  wall’’  between  grant
reviewers  and  program  managers.  This  system  presumably  is  designed  to  protect
university  grant  applicants  but  has  no  value  in  the  SBIR  program.  In  the  Army
SBIR program, for example, funding decisions are typically made by Program Man-
agers  in  consultation  with  two  subject  matter  experts,  one  inside  the  government
the other outside. This arrangement permits SBIR applicants to get useful feedback
from  the  funding  agency  on  prospective  applications  before  investing  significant  re-
courses in the application process.

2. Increase the NIH set-aside for SBIR and STTR

The SBIR statute requires applicable federal agencies to expend not less than 2.5
percent of their R&D budgets with small business concerns. 15 USC 638(f). Unfortu-
nately, this floor has been interpreted by the NIH to be a ceiling. While 2.5 percent
may  be  a  correct  set  aside  for  many  agencies  it  is  too  small  for  the  NIH.  Most  dis-
ease treatments today are being advanced by small biotech companies.

The  STTR  program,  which  is  directed  to  the  transfer  of  technology  from  univer-
sities  and  non-profit  research  institutes  to  small  businesses,  is  arguably  more  sig-
nificant  in  the  health  care  context  than  in  other  areas  of  technology.  Thus  the  0.3
percent  STTR  set  aside  is  woefully  inadequate  for  the  NIH  since  and  should  be
raised to at least 2.0 percent.

3. Expand the size and duration of Phase I awards

Most  biotech  projects  require  a  longer  award  period  and  greater  award  amount
than  those  commonly  allowed  under  the  Phase  I  SBIR  program.  Budgets  of  up  to
$250,000  costs  per  year  and  time  periods  of  up  to  two  years  for  Phase  I  should  be
routinely  permitted.  To  permit  these  larger  amounts  to  be  available  to  more  appli-
cants,  companies  should  be  limited  to  total  SBIR  support  per  year  (Phase  I  and
Phase  II)  of  $1  million.  Companies  deserving  of  federal  support  beyond  this  cap
should seek it through funding mechanisms outside of the SBIR pool.

4. Implement  a  Preliminary  Application  Process  to  Lower  the  Cost  of

Failure

Due  to  the  over  emphasis  on  ‘‘grantsmanship’’  and  preliminary  data  the  NIH
SBIR  application  process  is  very  expensive.  It  can  cost  a  small  company  nearly
$20,000 to prepare and submit a well written Phase I application while facing a suc-
cess  rate  of  only  about  18  percent.  This  costly  process  literally  drives  many  small
companies out of business and wastes government resources as well.

To  remedy  this  problem  the  NIH  should  adopt  a  preliminary  application  process
along  the  lines  of  that  employed  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s
HSARPA  program.  There,  a  five-page  white  paper  is  first  submitted  by  applicants
and  evaluated  by  the  HSAPA  staff  who  provide  a  written  assessment  of  the  likeli-
hood  of  success  if  a  full  application  is  submitted.  This  process  painlessly  rules  out
all  but  the  most  competitive  applications  and  saves  significant  time  and  money  for
both the applicant and the government.

5. Permit  Phase  I  recipients  with  matching  funds  to  apply  early  for

Phase II

The DOD SBIR program has implemented a Fast Track process for SBIR projects
that attract matching funds from an outside investor for the Phase II effort (as well
as  for  the  interim  effort  between  Phases  I  and  II).  Under  this  program  companies
may  submit  their  Fast  Track  application  within  150  days  of  receiving  their  Phase
I contract and these applications are given expedited review by DOD.

This  model  should  be  adopted  by  NIH  as  it  encourages  private  investment  and
helps bridge the gap between Phase I and II which can often last one or more years.
6. Encourage private investments in SBIR recipients through tax cred-

its (in lieu of Phase III funding)

The  idea  of  Phase  III  funding  is  problematic  because  it  would  siphon  away  fund-
ing  available  for  Phases  I  and  II.  Instead  I  believe  Congress  should  encourage  pri-
vate investment in small business technology developers through a new SBIR inves-
tor  tax  credit.  Such  a  program—modeled  after  the  New  Markets  Tax  Credits  Pro-
gram—would  permit  taxpayers  to  receive  a  credit  against  federal  income  taxes  for
making  qualified  equity  investments  in  companies  that  have  received  a  Phase  II
award.  The  credit  provided  to  the  investor  would  total  40  percent  of  the  cost  of  the
investment credit from their federal income taxes that would accrue over four years.
The maximum total credit available from combined investments in any one company

74

would  be  limited  to  two  times  the  value  of  the  Phase  II  award.  Thus,  for  example,
a  recipient  of  a  $500,000  Phase  II  award  could  attract  an  additional  $1  million  in
private  capital  that  would  earn  those  investors  $400,000  in  tax  credits  over  four
years.

This  model  provides  a  more  cost-effective  way  to  leverage  taxpayer  dollars  than
additive  grants  and  has  proven  successful  in  those  states  (Ohio,  North  Carolina,
Maryland) that offer similar investor tax credit programs.
Q3. You  have  heard  the  arguments  made  by  Dr.  Nacy  and  Dr.  Cohen  on  why  their
company  should  be  able  to  compete  for  SBIR  awards.  Why  do  you  think  they
should not be able to compete for SBIR awards?

A3. More than 20 years ago Congress astutely recognized that small businesses de-
veloping  innovative  products  and  technologies  have  unique  strengths  that  can  help
our economy and society but also important limitations that put them at a disadvan-
tage  in  competing  for  federal  support.  Thus,  a  small  set-aside  (now  2.5  percent)  for
small  businesses  seeking  certain  federal  R&D  funding  programs  was  deemed  war-
ranted.

The law that created the SBIR program begins with this declaration of Congress’

policy in establishing the program:

The  expense  of  carrying  on  research  and  development  programs  is  beyond  the
means  of  many  small  business  concerns,  and  such  concerns  are  handicapped
in  obtaining  the  benefits  of  research  and  development  programs  conducted  at
government  expense.  These  small  business  concerns  are  thereby  placed  at  a
competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise sys-
tem  and  prevents  the  orderly  development  of  the  national  economy  (emphasis
added). [15 USC 638(a)]

Entities owned by large venture capital firms typically have access to substantial
financing  and  other  assets  and  are  neither  handicapped  nor  disadvantaged  in  com-
peting  for  federal  R&D  programs.  Hence  they  do  not  require  the  benefits  of  a  set
aside, especially one as small as the 2.5 percent SBIR set aside.

On  the  other  hand,  companies  of  various  sizes  and  ownership  structures  should
be  able  to  compete  for  federal  support  for  certain  high  risk,  high  impact  R&D  for
which adequate private capital is unavailable. This support should not, however, be
drawn  from  the  SBIR  pool  but  rather  the  other  97.5  percent  of  the  agency  R&D
budget.
Q4. Your company 20/20 GeneSystems has institutional investors. What are institu-
tional  investors  and  how  do  they  differ  from  VC  investors?  Don’t  your  investors
also push you to develop marketable products?

A4. Our  company  is  currently  majority  owned  by  more  than  a  dozen  individual
‘‘Angel’’ investors and our founders and minority owned by three institutional inves-
tors.  These  three  institutional  investors  include  one  venture  capital  fund,  a  Japa-
nese  company  that  has  marketing  rights  to  our  products  in  Asia,  and  a  law  firm.
Collectively we have raised about $2.5 million in private equity to date.

The  fact  that  our  company  is  majority  owned  by  individuals  rather  than  institu-
tions has a profound impact on our priorities, culture, and method of operations. In-
dividuals  invest  in  companies  for  multiple  reasons,  some  of  which  go  beyond  finan-
cial return. This is particularly the case in biotech where ‘‘disease Angels’’ have be-
come  an  increasingly  important  source  of  early  stage  capital.  These  high  net  worth
individuals  invest  not  only  in  hopes  of  earning  a  solid  return  but  also  to  advance
treatments to particular diseases that they care about personally. In contrast, man-
agers  of  funds  made  up  of  large  corporations,  pension  funds  and  the  like  have  a  fi-
duciary  duty  to  disregard  their  personal  interests  and  seek  to  maximize  the  finan-
cial return for their shareholders.

In 2001 we introduced a product called BioCheckΤΜ that is now routinely used by
over  300  first  responder  organizations  and  federal  agencies  to  screen  suspicious
powders. I am convinced that had we been majority owned by large institutional in-
vestors rather than individuals we would not have been able to launch this product
due to perceived liability risk and unpredictable markets.
Q5. In  your  remarks  I  noted  that  you  refer  to  large  VC  investors  as  the  problem.
What  is  the  difference  between  a  large  VC  investor  and  a  small  VC  investor?
How do you define a large VC investor?

A5. A ‘‘large VC’’ is a fund (typically organized as a limited partnership) that is ma-
jority owned by corporations. These corporations (limited partners) typically include
pension funds, Fortune 500 companies, or insurance companies.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 16:36 Nov 04, 2005 Jkt 021948 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\062805\21948 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

75

A  ‘‘small  VC’’  is  a  fund  that  is  majority  owned  by  high  net  worth  individuals.  (I
would  put  Angel  clubs  in  the  same  category  as  small  VCs.)  Under  current  SBA
rules, a company majority owned by a small VC is eligible to participate in the SBIR
program.

Today  individual  ‘‘Angel’’  investors—not  venture  capital  firms—are  the  primary
source of early stage capital for most biotech start-ups in the U.S. This was the sub-
ject  of  a  March  7,  2005  feature  story  in  Business  Week  titled  ‘‘Where  VCs  Fear  to
Tread:  Angel  investors  are  filling  a  critical  gap  by  providing  early  backing  for
biotechs.’’

The  following  data  compiled  by  Boston  Millennia  Partners,  a  leading  life  science
VC  firm  illustrates  how  Angel  investors  in  early  stage  companies  are  growing  rel-
ative to VCs:

I  believe  it  is  proper  for  companies  that  are  majority  owned  by  small  VCs—not

large VCs—to access the SBIR program.
Q6. You  recommend  that  Congress  develop  new  initiatives,  open  to  companies  of  all
sizes  to  bridge  the  growing  ‘‘valley  of  death’’  between  basic  discoveries  proof-of-
concept.  Could  you  give  us  some  examples  of  what  you  envision?  Are  you  famil-
iar  with  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)?  If  so,  should  the  Federal
Government support programs like this and others like it?

A6. Biomedical  innovation  in  America  today  is  ‘‘stagnant’’  according  to  the  FDA.1
Significant improvements in outcomes for patients with cancer, Alzheimer’s disease,
spinal  cord  injury  and  other  maladies  have  changed  little  over  the  past  30  years.
The  problem  according  the  FDA’s  2004  Critical  Path  Report  is  that  ‘‘the  applied
sciences  needed  for  medical  product  development  have  not  kept  pace  with  the  tre-
mendous advances in the basic sciences.’’ The report provides the FDA’s analysis of
the  ‘‘pipeline  problem’’  namely,  the  recent  slowdown,  instead  of  the  expected  accel-
eration,  in  innovative  drugs  and  diagnostics  reaching  patients.  According  to  the  re-
port,  despite  the  explosion  of  bioscience  and  genomics  research  over  the  past  ten
years  the  number  of  new  drug  applications  submitted  to  the  FDA  has  actually  de-
clined. significantly.

I  am  convinced  that  this  slowdown  in  biomedical  innovation  is  a  direct  result  of
the  ‘‘valley  of  death’’  phenomenon.  Today  nearly  all  public  funding  is  allocated  for
basic  research  while  most  private  capital  is  flowing  towards  late  stage,  lower  risk
product  development.  This  ‘‘barbell’’  effect  has  resulted  in  a  huge  gap—a  valley  of
death—that has effectively stalled biomedical innovation in the U.S. today:

ical Products. (www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/criticalpath)

76

To help fill this gap and create a ‘‘valley of life’’ a two pronged approach is needed:
(1)  shift  a  greater  portion  of  government  funding  towards  high-risk  product  and

The  investor  tax  credit  concept  was  discussed  above  as  a  proposed  private  sector

alternative to Phase III funding.

Regarding  government  funding,  Congress  should  set  as  a  benchmark  that  about
one-third  of  the  NIH  budget  (extramural  and  intramural)  should  be  dedicated  to
R&D  that  can  be  applied  or  translated  into  the  development—within  about  five  to
seven years—of tangible products that fill critical unmet patient needs. To that end
the NIH will need new programs that support high risk, high impact technology de-
velopment by companies of all size as well as non-profit research institutes and uni-
versities. Such programs at other agencies have proven to be very successful includ-
ing  DARPA  (Defense),  ATP  (NIST),  In-Q-Tel  (CIA),  and  HSARPA  (Homeland  Secu-
rity). The National Cancer Institute has stated that the DARPA and HSARPA mod-
els ‘‘could be highly appropriate to accelerate the development of the advanced can-
cer technologies needed to achieve the NCI’s 2015 goal.2

Funding decisions and management of such a program would be the responsibility
government  program  managers  experienced  in  moving  advanced  technology  from
concept to market in a timely manner. These programs would be open to companies
of  all  size,  as  well  as  nonprofit  research  centers  and  medical  schools  that  can  offer
a path to bringing the products to market through a licensing program, etc.

At  the  June  28,  2005  Hearing  the  otherwise  divided  panel  of  biotech  CEOs
seemed  united  on  one  issue:  that  there  is  clear  a  need  for  a  new  ATP-like  program
dedicated  specifically  to  advanced  biomedical  product  and  technology  development
(see  transcript  pages  71–73).  To  that  end  I  would  propose  that  a  new  ‘‘Advanced
Healthcare  Technology  Development’’  program  be  created  that  would  be  jointly  ad-
ministered  by  the  NIST  and  NIH.3 NIST,  with  its  considerable  expertise  in  the
physical and material sciences and engineering, would focus on applications directed
to innovative platform technologies that cut across multiple disease areas. The NIH
would  focus  on  novel  applications  of  innovative  technologies  in  specific  disease
areas.
Q7. What is your opinion of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP)?

ties to Accelerate Progress Against Cancer,’’ January 2004, page 24.

3 I  have  had  many  discussions  with  persons  in  industry  and  government  about  the  idea  of
such  a  joint  program  and  have  received  unanimously  positive  feedback.  At  the  request  of  the
Science Committee or any Member I would volunteer to help work on a detailed proposal.

A7. While  I  have  no  direct  experience  with  the  ATP  program  the  feedback  I  have
received from counterparts at other companies about the program has been extraor-
dinarily  positive.  Companies  seem  much  more  enthusiastic  about  the  ATP  program
than  any  other  government  support  program  that  I  am  aware  of.  The  most  impor-
tant  unique  attribute  of  NIST  ATP  is  its  emphasis  on  high  risk  technology  innova-
tion which today receives almost no support from either the venture capital commu-
nity  or  the  NIH.4 A  new  report  issued  in  August  by  the  FDA  and  the  Association
of  American  Medical  Colleges  on  the  decline  of  innovative  drugs  noted  the  lack  of
platform technology development as a key problem:

Another  problem  arises  from  declining  biotechnology  industry  development  of
platform technology (fundamental scientific tools used in drug discovery), large-
ly  because  venture  capitalists  no  longer  are  interested  in  funding  such  re-
search.. . .The creation of new technology platforms is critical to the long-term
survival of the bio-pharmaceutical industry and may require more support from
government  agencies  and  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry  to  sustain  this  field.5
Also  the  ATP  places  heavy  emphasis  on  the  ability  of  awardees  to  bring  their
technology to market. It is very important that Congress restore funding to the ATP
and use it as a model for other federal R&D programs.

I believe ATP would serve as an excellent model for the aforementioned proposed
Advanced  Healthcare  Technology  Development  program  that  would  be  jointly  ad-
ministered by NIST and NIH.

4 ‘‘For  a  few  years  in  the  late  1990s,  prior  to  the  bursting  of  the  ‘‘genomics  bubble’’  in  2000,
Wall Street was very supportive of platform technologies. Five years later there remains no sign
of interest returning to this space. New platform technologies will be essential for the emergence
of  ‘‘personalized  medicine’’  wherein  therapies  are  tailored  to  patients  based  on  genomic  and
proteomic biomarkers.

Responses by Carol A. Nacy, Chief Executive Officer, Sequella, Inc.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Q1. As a small business with less than 500 employees, or in your case less than 100
employees,  If  you  raise  a  round  of  venture  financing  would  you  say  that  all  of
your  fundraising  needs  have  been  satisfied?  Are  you  able  to  pursue  all  of  the
projects  and  business  leads  you  would  like  to  pursue  with  this  venture  financ-
ing?

A1. No to both parts of the question: The high cost of drug development (many hun-
dreds  of  millions  of  dollars)  means  that  I  will  likely  have  several  venture  financing
rounds under my belt at Sequella before I will have product on the market. The ini-
tial round of venture financing (Series A) that I hope to close before the end of 2005
will  be  applied  to  the  clinical  trials  of  two  of  our  products  close  to  registration  or
human  testing:  a  Phase  III  trial  (efficacy  in  human  population)  of  a  new  TB  diag-
nostic  to  be  used  outside  the  U.S.  and  a  Phase  I  trial  (safety  only,  no  efficacy)  of
a new TB drug to shorten treatment in the U.S. from six months to fewer than six
months (we hope). Additional funding will be required to determine if the new drug
actually  can  shorten  treatment  time,  and  those  are  the  expensive  efficacy  trials
(Phase II and Phase III). Additional funding rounds will be required for these later
trials.

In  addition  to  clinical  trials  of  the  new  diagnostic  for  ex-U.S.  use  and  the  new
drug  that  will  be  funded  by  the  Series  A  financing,  Sequella  has  a  pipeline  of  new
and  important  technologies  and  drugs  that  will  not  be  funded  by  the  Series  A  (or
subsequent  Series  B)  venture  round(s).  We  have  a  second  generation  of  the  ex-U.S.
diagnostic that is being readied for regulatory submission to the U.S. FDA, we have
two other anti-TB drugs (both work against multi-drug resistant TB, a Class C bio-
weapon)  that  are  ready  for  formal  preclinical  toxicity  studies  that  precede  human
clinical  trials,  we  have  a  technology  that  enables  physicians  to  determine  the  anti-
biotics  to  which  a  TB  organism  is  susceptible  in  two  days  (rather  than  the  current
technique  that  takes  up  to  12  weeks)  that  is  ready  for  predicate  testing  in  a  field
setting,  and  we  have  a  wristwatch-like  device  that  can  help  patients  take  their
drugs  correctly  and  inform  physicians  when  they  do  not  (a  compliance  monitor).
None  of  these  drugs,  diagnostics,  or  devices  will  be  commercialized  by  the  Series  A
or  future  Series  B  venture  financing.  All  of  these  pipeline  technologies  have  been
financed, are currently financed, or we have applied for financing for them through
SBIR  grants  and  contracts.  Without  access  to  the  extra-VC  funds  that  are  supplied
by  the  SBIR  program,  our  pipeline  will  dry  up,  and  the  U.S.  and  rest  of  world  will
be the poorer for not having these resources for identification and control of TB.
Q2. Given  the  10–15  years  of  work  and  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  it  takes  to
complete  testing  and  gain  approval  of  a  biotechnology  therapy,  venture  capital
investment  is  often  a  necessity  for  many  biotechnology  companies.  If  bio-
technology companies receive venture capital for their research and development,
why is it necessary for these companies to also receive SBIR monies?

A2. See  above  answer  for  application  of  venture  capital  money:  there  is  little  to  no
money  in  the  venture  capital  community  today  for  the  early  discovery  and  develop-
ment  research  that  underlies  product  identification  and  clinical  development.  Ven-
ture  money  now  goes  to  late-stage  technologies.  Innovation  occurs  in  the  earliest
stages of research, not at the late stages where we must comply with a complex set
of  FDA  rules  and  regulations  to  assure  safety  and  efficacy  of  products  in  humans.
No innovation can happen once you move to clinical trials. Building successful com-
panies, and contributing to the U.S. economy with jobs, products, and revenues, re-
quires  both  innovation  and  clinical  development.  We  will  stunt  the  innovation  re-
quired  to  solve  such  complex  issues  as  bioweapon  defense,  cancer,  global  infectious
diseases that impact U.S. public health if every time we move one product into clin-
ical  trials  funded  by  venture  capital  we  stop  the  innovation  process  in  a  company.
Companies that can successfully navigate the high-risk process of product identifica-
tion  and  development  should  be  supported  by  our  government  at  every  possible
level,  including  at  the  most  fundamental  level  for  product  success,  early-stage  re-
search. The program that exists to support that early-stage, high-risk innovation is
the SBIR program.
Q3. If a firm is more than 51 percent owned by one or more venture or institutional
investors,  would  you  consider  your  business  to  be  controlled  by  these  investors?
A3. It  is  difficult  to  actually  control  the  day-to-day  functions  of  a  company,  even  if
you  own  more  than  51  percent  of  that  company,  although  there  may  be  companies
where such is the case.

It  is  rare  to  find  a  single  venture  capital  firm  ready  to  assume  ALL  the  risk  of
financing  a  particular  biotechnology  company,  given  our  spectacular  failure  rate.
They generally invest through consortia of VC in order to minimize and share risk.
The term sheets that I have seen from venture capital consortia, both in my present
company,  my  past  two  companies,  and  in  the  industry  in  which  I  work,  provide  for
the  lead  (the  VC  company  who  contributed  the  highest  percentage  of  money  to  the
consortium) and perhaps one other venture investor to have a seat on the corporate
Board.  The  standard  format  is  to  reconfigure  the  company  Board  to  have  two  rep-
resentatives  from  the  venture  groups,  two  representatives  selected  from  the  com-
pany (usually CEO) and the pre-financing Board, and one independent Board mem-
ber. Thus, control is balanced by in-house and independent interests, including ven-
ture interests.

The ownership percentage could provide a level of control at the shareholder level
and  would  be  exercized  at  the  annual  shareholders  meeting,  where  Directors  are
elected and changes to the architecture of the company are voted upon.

Finally, a certain amount of leverage on how VC funds are utilized (and thus the
immediate directions of the company) can be assumed from the acquisition of capital
from  any  venture  group:  clearly  they  are  investing  their  money  in  certain  aspects
of  the  company  that  they  believe  will  lead  to  product  and  sales,  giving  them  a  re-
turn on their investment. In this sense, they are just like the SBIR program: a SBIR
grant  is  given  to  innovate  around  a  certain  set  of  scientific  assumptions  and  data,
and  you  cannot  use  SBIR  money  for  other  unrelated  innovations  that  you  have  not
spelled  out  in  advance.  Everybody  wants  to  know  that  their  money  is  used  ‘‘appro-
priately.’’
Q4. The SBA recently issued a Final Rule (69 Fed. Reg. 70180) that amended SBIR
eligibility requirements to allow grant awardees to be 51 percent owned and con-
trolled by another business, as long as the other business is itself at least 51 per-
cent owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or per-
manent resident aliens in, the U.S. Does this Final Rule solve the eligibility con-
cerns by VCC-backed biotechnology companies?

A4. No,  not  really.  If  we  could  select  the  VC  who  were  willing  to  invest  in  us,  and
if there was complete transparency in the identity of the Limited Partners of funds
that  would  allow  us  to  make  informed  choices  that  complied  with  this  rule,  then
perhaps it would be sufficient. In reality, however, we do not have financing choices.
It  is  hard  enough  to  get  a  single  VC  to  agree  to  lead  a  financing  round  (as  they
assume  the  responsibility  for  due  diligence  and  risk  assessment),  and  it  costs  so
much to bring a biotech product to market that we cannot afford to turn down any-
one who takes the inherently high-risk approach of financing us. That’s why VC are
able to strike such good deals: we need their money. Supply and demand.
Q5. The SBA has been holding a series of Public Hearings across the country to ad-
dress  two  topics:  (1)  the  restructuring  of  small  business  size  standards;  and  (2)
the possible participation of small businesses majority-owned by venture capital
companies in the SBIR program. These hearings follow the SBA’s announcement
that  they  are  considering  whether  exclusion  from  affiliation  rules  for  VCC-
backed  companies  should  be  provided  in  size  determinations  for  eligibility  in
SBIR  program.  Would  this  exclusion  solve  the  eligibility  concerns  by  VCC-
backed biotechnology companies?

A5. If the ‘‘affiliation rule’’ implies that the head-count for my company (17 persons
at present), once venture-backed, would also include the head-count of the VC group
itself  and  all  of  their  portfolio  companies,  then  that  rule  should  be  revoked  in  all
cases. My 17-person company gets no benefit whatsoever, financial or business, from
any other company in an investor’s portfolio, whether we are talking VC or high net
worth individual. But a change in that rule would not solve the other interpretation,
that  VC  do  not  count  as  individuals  (even  though  they  and  their  limited  partners
are  controlled  by  individuals)  in  the  51  percent  individual  ownership  issue.  That’s
a separate and equally problematic stance that should be changed.
Q6. Aside from the issue today, what other recommendation would you make on how
the  SBIR  program  could  be  improved?  For  example,  are  the  Phase  I  and  Phase
II  award  levels  sufficient?  Also,  what  are  your  thoughts  on  Phase  III  funding?
A6. There is never enough money! The traditional $75,000 for Phase I (six months),
$750,000  for  Phase  II  (two  years)  is  a  drop  in  the  bucket  for  both  money  and  time
in  biotech  product  development,  where  even  a  simple  diagnostic  kit  takes  $5–$10
million  and  4–6  years  to  get  to  market.  The  NIH  has  an  extraordinary  SBIR  pro-
gram  that  recognizes  both  the  time  and  the  cost  of  product  development,  and  this
has  greatly  helped  in  driving  products  to  commercialization.  The  ability  of  certain

government  institutions  to  shift  SBIR  funding  amounts  to  meet  their  goals  would
be  a  good  innovation  for  the  SBA  and  the  SBIR  program  in  general.  Regarding
Phase III money, I would certainly avail Sequella of the opportunity to compete for
such  funds,  if  available.  Phase  III  would  be  particularly  useful  for  Company  prod-
ucts  that  are  not  of  interest  to  VC,  but  are  of  interest  to  the  U.S.  Government  and
the originating Company.
Q7. What  is  your  assessment  of  how  NIH  is  managing  its  SBIR  program?  What

could NIH do better?

A7. I have experience primarily with NIAID at the NIH. I find their administration
of  the  SBIR  program  to  itself  be  innovative  (they  have  a  special  SBIR–AT–NIAID
program  that  is  excellent,  and  they  are  currently  experimenting  with  the  idea  of
Phase III funding for certain of the technologies that they determine are important
for  their  mission).  They  have  moved  from  primarily  academic  reviewers  of  SBIR
grants  to  predominantly  industry  scientists,  with  a  resulting  increase  in  insights
into  the  common  problems  of  product  development  and  the  science  of  translational
research.  This  results  in  better  critiques  and  makes  revised  grants  all  that  much
stronger.  Other  Institutes  at  the  NIH  should  adopt  many  of  the  innovations  that
NIAID has in place or is exploring.
Q8. What  is  your  response  to  those  who  say  that  changing  the  current  venture  cap-
ital  participation  rules  would  fundamentally  change  the  structure  of  the  SBIR
program?

A8. That’s a bit disingenuous. The SBIR program did not have restrictions on VCC-
backed companies for its first 20 years (1983–2003), then the rules changed for the
last two years. The preponderance of time and evidence of the structure of the SBIR
program is in favor of the VCC-backed company participation as the norm.
Q9. Your  company  is  located  in  Maryland.  What  are  your  thoughts  on  Mr.  Cohen’s
comments that changes to the rules for VC investments would be bad for Mary-
land biotech companies?

A9. Mr.  Cohen  is  entitled  to  his  opinion.  However,  the  argument  he  proposes  for
no-change  is  one  of  competition.  Lower  the  number  of  eligible  participants  and  in-
crease the probability of funding.

I  actually  find  that  offensive.  I  am  looking  for  the  best  science  when  I  review
grants,  and  I  don’t  actually  care  whether  the  person  has  other  funding  as  well,  or
who  supplies  that  funding.  I  want  the  science  to  be  sound  and  the  plan  to  be  fea-
sible. There is a lot of science that is flawed: not all science should be funded. There
are many scientists/start-up companies who cannot make a cohesive and comprehen-
sible plan to move that science forward: not all scientists/companies should be fund-
ed. Competition is what drives innovation and hones great science. I am not venture
financed at the moment, and I have no fear that, should the rule be changed, I will
compete  successfully  for  additional  SBIR  grants  no  matter  who  is  in  the  applicant
mix. And if my current percent success rate begins to decline, I will not blame VCC-
backed companies, but my own scientists for having not made crystal clear the inno-
vation  and  importance  of  the  products  we  work  on.  It’s  all  about  good  science  that
underpins good products.
Q10. What is your opinion of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP)?
A10. I like the concept, but at present the ATP program is set up more for engineer-
ing and environmental technologies than biotechnology. It would be nice to have an
ATP program dedicated to biotech.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION

The following testimony is submitted on behalf of the National Venture Capital As-
sociation, a trade organization representing approximately 470 venture capital firms
in the United States.

Venture  capital  is  the  investment  of  equity  to  support  the  creation  and  develop-
ment  of  new,  growth-oriented  businesses.  Venture  backed  companies  are  critical  to
the U.S. economy in terms of creating jobs, generating revenue, and fostering inno-
vation.  This  segment  of  the  economy,  the  entrepreneurial  segment,  is  the  true
differentiator  for  the  U.S.  in  terms  of  global  competitiveness.  U.S.  companies  origi-
nally funded with venture capital now represent 11 percent of annual GDP and em-
ploy over 10 million Americans. Companies that were originally funded with venture
capital  dollars  include:  FedEx,  Genentech,  Intel,  Cisco,  Amgen,  Apple,  Starbucks,
Amazon, e-Bay and Google.

We respectfully submit testimony today on behalf of those venture-backed compa-
nies  that  are  developing  innovative  technologies  to  improve  the  quality  of  our  lives
and raise our standard of living. Historically, the dual financing sources of the SBIR
program and the venture capital community have allowed many of these promising
companies  to  conduct  groundbreaking  scientific  research  and  simultaneously  build
viable  businesses  that  will  bring  these  innovations  to  the  marketplace.  However,
changes  in  the  interpretation  of  SBIR  grant  eligibility  have  prevented  many  small
companies  that  receive  venture  financing  from  also  receiving  SBIR  grants,  effec-
tively  cutting  off  a  critical  research  lifeline.  This  dynamic  has  negatively  impacted
young  companies  across  the  country,  particularly  in  the  life  sciences  sector,  but  in
other high tech industries as well.

For the last two years, we have received calls from our member firms alerting us
to situations in which an SBIR grant has been denied because the company has ven-
ture  investors.  As  a  result,  several  of  these  companies  have  shelved  research
projects, laid off scientific teams, or scaled back operations.

Venture investment, which has measured more than $350 billion during the past
20 years, has vastly improved the quality of our lives by bringing innovation to the
market  place.  On  the  life  sciences  side,  more  than  one  in  three  Americans  has  di-
rectly  benefited  from  a  venture  capital  backed  innovation.  Medical  devices  such  as
the  pacemaker,  the  MRI,  and  the  pulse  oximeter  as  well  as  pharmaceuticals  such
as  ENBREL  for  arthritis,  Herceptin  for  cancer  and  Integrilin  for  coronary  disease
were all brought to market through venture capital investment.

It  is  paramount  not  to  confuse  the  role  of  venture  capital  funding  with  the  role
of  basic  R&D  funding.  Both  are  critical  to  bringing  innovation  to  the  marketplace.
However,  basic  research  funding  is  targeted  at  discovery  and  invention.  It  is  this
type  of  activity  that  the  SBIR  program  has  historically  supported  in  the  past.  Ven-
ture capital dollars are applied later in the life cycle and used to build a strong and
viable business so that promising discoveries can be brought to market.

There  is  a  myth  that  says  if  a  company  receives  venture  capital,  it  has  ‘‘hit  the
lottery’’  and  does  not  need  government  funding.  Nothing  could  be  further  from  the
truth.  In  the  life  sciences  sector,  the  cost  and  time  associated  with  bringing  a  dis-
covery to market is colossal. Multiple rounds of financings at millions of dollars per
round  is  required.  In  2004  alone,  the  venture  capital  industry  invested  more  than
$5.7  billion  in  the  sector  with  the  average  investment  in  each  biotech  company  at
$9.8  million.1 Yet  these  venture  capital  investments  are  aimed  at  commercializing
products  and  are  not  sufficient  to  meet  a  company’s  ongoing  research  needs.  With
the  average  cost  of  bringing  a  new  drug  to  market  at  $800  million,2 young  bio-
technology  companies  cannot  divert  precious  venture  capital  funds  earmarked  for
business growth to embark upon new research projects. And although these projects
may hold the next ground breaking treatment for Alzheimer’s, cancer, or heart dis-
ease,  under  the  current  eligibility  interpretation,  the  SBIR  program  cannot  fund
these projects if the company is 51 percent owned by venture capital firms. The re-
sult: additional research is stalled or permanently shelved and the SBA has missed
a tremendous opportunity to support a promising innovation.

There is another myth that venture investment only impacts select regions of the
country. To the contrary, venture capital is a national phenomenon. (see Exhibit A)
While  California  and  Massachusetts  are  the  leading  regions  for  venture  capital  in-
vestment, VC dollars have been flowing into all 50 states over the last twenty years
and  have  directly  benefited  regional  economies  across  the  country.  More  than  $10
billion has been infused into states such as Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado, New Jer-

sey,  and  Washington  respectively.  Other  states  such  as  Florida,  Connecticut,  Illi-
nois,  Maryland  and  Minnesota  have  received  venture  investment  of  more  than  $5
billion each. As a result these states have experienced economic growth in terms of
jobs  and  revenues.  A  combination  of  venture  capital  and  SBIR  grant  distributions
in any region would have an incredibly positive impact as groundbreaking research
could be conducted simultaneously with new products being brought to market.

Ironically,  the  current  SBIR  eligibility  rule  hurts  the  very  ‘‘low  tech  regions’’  it
is trying to support. In regions such as these, where there is a small venture capital
presence, often numerous venture firms must join together to fund a promising start
up,  as  a  single  local  firm  does  not  have  the  resources  to  meet  the  company’s  need.
As  each  firm  takes  an  equity  stake  in  the  company,  the  total  venture  ownership
stake quickly rises above the 51 percent threshold as defined by the SBIR eligibility.
Consequently,  companies  in  regions  with  a  low  VC  presence  are  unjustly  penalized
by  the  current  SBIR  eligibility  rule.  Since  there  is  no  way  to  tell  in  advance  which
small  companies  will  grow  to  tomorrow’s  large  public  success  stories  or  important
regional  employers,  nurturing  companies  in  all  segments  of  the  country  is  impor-
tant.

The  2000  Small  Business  Reauthorization  Act  sought  to  expand  and  improve  the
SBIR program, stimulate technological innovation, use small businesses to meet fed-
eral research and development needs, and strengthen the technological competitive-
ness  of  small  businesses  in  the  United  States.  By  excluding  venture-backed  compa-
nies from eligibility, the SBIR program is bypassing many of America’s most prom-
ising  and  innovative  small  businesses.  After  all,  these  are  the  companies  whose
technologies,  business  plans,  financial  strategies  and  management  teams  have  all
been  vetted  by  highly  skilled  professionals  with  extensive  backgrounds  in  science
and business who earn their living identifying the best and brightest opportunities.
The venture capitalist searches for companies that are poised for success, companies
that will be viable for years to come, companies that intend to put a product on the
market that will improve lives. Funding these types of companies is also in the best
interest  of  the  SBIR  program  as  it  prevents  government  dollars  from  ending  up  in
grant  mills,  funding  technologies  that  will  never  see  the  light  of  day.  Funding  ven-
ture backed companies brings the science to life.

A  way  to  ensure  the  ongoing  success  of  the  SBIR  program  is  to  re-open  it  to  the
broadest  and  most  qualified  base  of  small  businesses  as  possible,  and  this  requires
allowing venture financed companies to once again compete. The venture capital in-
dustry has been a major player in augmenting the SBIR program since its inception
25 years ago. Venture capital and SBIR funding have been proven to work together
to  research,  commercialize,  and  distribute  innovative  products  on  an  accelerated
basis.  The  relationship  between  the  two  is  symbiotic,  with  the  beneficiary  being
Americans  who  are  the  recipients  of  life  saving  innovations,  time  saving  tech-
nologies, and standard of living enhancements.

Last  week,  Congressmen  Graves,  Baird,  Honda  and  Inslee  introduced  H.R.  2943.
This legislation puts into law a clarification of SBIR eligibility requirements for ven-
ture  backed  start  up  companies.  The  NVCA  applauds  their  efforts  and  encourages
quick action on this legislation. H.R. 2943 would amend the Small Business Act by
adding a definition allowing any business concern that is at least 51 percent owned
and  controlled  by  one  or  more  individuals  and/or  venture  capital  companies,  pro-
vided  that  no  affiliated  venture  capital  company  shall  own  or  control  more  than  49
percent of the business concern, nor be controlled by a company which is not a small
business  to  participate  in  the  program.  NVCA  believes  this  legislation  addresses
this spiraling problem.

Thank you for the opportunity to express NVCA’s views on these vital issues.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION (BIO)
This statement is submitted by the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), an
organization  representing  over  1,100  companies,  universities,  research  institutions,
state biotechnology associations and affiliates in 50 states.

BIO applauds the Subcommittee for holding a hearing on the Small Business Re-
search  Innovation  (SBIR)  grant  program.  While  BIO  represents  many  established
companies  in  the  industry,  the  vast  majority  of  BIO  members,  over  eighty-five  per-
cent,  are  small,  emerging  companies  with  fewer  than  500  employees.  In  fact,  more
than  fifty  percent  of  the  companies  in  the  biotechnology  industry  have  fewer  than
50  employees.  The  SBIR  program  has  played  a  critical  role  in  providing  necessary
financing for small biotechnology companies. Unfortunately, however, an interpreta-
tion  by  the  Small  Business  Administration  (SBA)  of  the  eligibility  requirements  for
the  SBIR  program  has  prevented  the  majority  of  BIO  members  from  participating
in the program.

To  qualify  for  SBIR  grants,  a  small  business  applicant  must  meet  certain  eligi-
bility  requirements.  The  size  and  ownership  requirements—or  ‘‘size  standard’’—
limit  eligibility  to  those  companies  that:  (i)  are  at  least  51  percent  owned  and  con-
trolled by one or more individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens
in, the United States and (ii) have no more than 500 employees, including any affili-
ates.

However,  on  January  10,  2001,  the  SBA  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals  ruled  in
CBR  Laboratories,  Inc.  that  the  definition  of  ‘‘individuals’’  was  limited  to  natural
persons  and  could  not  include  an  entity  such  as  a  venture  capital  company  (VCC).
Two  years  later,  this  new  interpretation  of  ‘‘individuals’’  resulted  in  the  denial  of
a  SBIR  grant  to  Cognetix,  Inc.  because  the  company  was  venture  capital-backed  in
excess  of  51  percent.  Other  biotechnology  companies  subsequently  have  also  been
denied SBIR grant money or have opted to delay their submissions in the hopes that
this  issue  will  be  re-considered.  As  a  result,  work  on  life-saving  and  life-enhancing
technology is being postponed. (See Attachment)

Before  most  biotechnology  products  can  become  commercially  available,  years  of
work and hundreds of millions of dollars of capital are required to complete testing
and  gain  product  approvals.  While  there  are  many  different  funding  strategies,  the
typical  form  of  investment  in  promising,  early-stage  companies  is  venture  capital.
Such  capital  comes  primarily  from  VCCs,  whose  interests  are  usually  owned  by  a
combination  of  individual  investors,  business  entities  and  pension  funds.  After  the
initial  seed  funding  is  invested  in  support  of  basic  R&D,  a  typical  biotechnology
company  seeks  venture  capital  investments  to  allow  it  to  expand  R&D  and  eventu-
ally  launch  commercial  operations.  Because  of  the  significant  funding  required  to
bring biotechnology products to market, very few biotechnology companies are capa-
ble of commercializing their technologies without significant VCC backing.

In  our  industry,  even  the  relatively  small  amount  of  money  a  company  will  raise
in  its  first  round  of  financing  (Series  A),  $5–$8  million,  generally  will  result  in  the
new investors—usually a collection of venture funds—owning more than 50 percent
of  the  company.  Indeed,  based  on  a  survey  of  our  members,  it  is  clear  that  for  the
majority that have raised venture funding, the ownership structure is such that the
collection  of  venture  investors  and  other  outside  investment  groups  own  more  than
50 percent of the company.

In  the  biotechnology  industry,  there  is  a  specific  need  for  both  SBIR  and  VCC
funding.  The  lengthy  and  costly  clinical  development  process  for  biotechnology  re-
quires investment that is out of reach for most small business entities. Limiting gov-
ernment support for this type of R&D to firms without VC funding as a main source
of additional financing effectively cuts out smaller firms with excellent science foun-
dations.  This  restriction  risks  delaying  the  discovery  and  development  of  promising
new  therapies  for  cancer,  diabetes,  Parkinson’s  and,  significantly,  many  disease
areas where there is less commercial focus, like tuberculosis or diseases that would
qualify for an orphan drug classification.

While  almost  all  of  our  member  companies  will  need  to  raise  venture  financing
to advance their products toward the marketplace, many small biotechnology compa-
nies have come to rely upon the SBIR program Phase I and Phase II grants to fund
cutting edge research in areas where venture capital and other sources of financing
are difficult to obtain. This is typically the case for companies that need early-stage
funding  for  proof-of-concept,  while  they  are  putting  together  their  initial  rounds  of
financing.  SBIR  grants  also  have  been  very  useful  to  early-stage  biotech  companies
to  fund  research  on  programs  different  from  the  lead  programs  around  which  they
have  raised  their  venture  financing.  Many  companies  will  raise  a  venture  round
that is deliberately sized to the amount of funds needed to advance a lead program
because  the  amount  of  money  required  is  usually  relatively  high  and  the  company

does  not  want  to  take  on  more  debt  and  dilution  than  necessary.  While  they  are
working  on  these  lead  programs,  they  often  come  across  new  potential  indications
or  new  project  opportunities  that  they  will  want  to  test  before  attempting  to  raise
additional money. The SBIR program is ideally suited for this purpose, because the
company  already  has  demonstrated  that  it  can  successfully  raise  follow-on  financ-
ing—one of the key criteria in evaluating an SBIR Phase II grant proposal.

BIO  conducted  two  surveys  this  year  to  understand  the  nature  and  scope  of  this
problem  for  our  industry.  The  results  of  both  surveys  confirm  that  SBA’s  current
SBIR  size  standard  is  severely  limiting  and  discouraging  small  biotechnology  com-
panies from participating in the SBIR program.

Of  the  respondents  to  the  first  survey,  62  percent  (public  and  private  companies)
had applied for SBIR grants over the last five years. Exactly half of these applicants
were  denied  grants  either  immediately  because  they  could  not  meet  the  SBIR  size
standard owing to their ownership structure, or subsequently, because of an adverse
determination regarding their size. Interestingly, over 60 percent of privately owned
companies  chose  not  even  to  apply  for  SBIR  grants  because  of  perceived  eligibility
concerns.

The  second  survey,  conducted  earlier  this  month,  was  designed  to  measure  the
larger impact the eligibility ruling is having on our overall membership and the in-
dustry.  Of  the  274  companies  surveyed,  25  companies  reported  having  been  turned
down  from  the  program,  and  55  percent  of  the  respondents  said  they  are  no  longer
applying  for  SBIR  grants.  Importantly,  34  percent  of  the  respondents  said  they  de-
layed or canceled a research project due to the SBIR ineligibility. These projects in-
cluded  a  promising  new  drug  for  lupus,  cell  therapy  for  delayed  wound  healing  in
diabetes, and therapies to protect cells and organisms against anthrax and radiation
exposure.

The  legislative  history  makes  it  abundantly  clear  that  Congress  intended  for  the
SBIR program to assist small businesses to commercialize their creations and prod-
ucts  and  to  stimulate  small  U.S.-owned  firms  to  produce  innovative  technologies.
Congress  very  clearly  recognized  and  endeavored  to  encourage  the  symbiotic  rela-
tionship  between  VCCs  and  small  technology  firms.  For  example,  an  entire  section
of  the  relevant  Committee  Report  details  the  importance  of  encouraging  private  in-
vestment. The Committee concluded that:

providing  small  firms  with  R&D  seed  money. . .will  encourage  additional  pri-
vate investment in these firms. The agency-wide SBIR program outlined in the
legislation  should  facilitate  the  ability  of  participating  firms  to  attract  venture
capital as well as other financial commitments from the private sector.1

Congress  viewed  the  SBIR  program  as  providing  the  necessary  ‘‘proof  of  concept’’
to  encourage  venture  capital  investment  in  promising  small  businesses  seeking  to
bring products from the workshop to the marketplace. Moreover, Congress even cre-
ated a Phase II SBIR preference for companies that attracted venture capital invest-
ment by providing:

special  consideration  in  the  funding  review  of  Phase  II  proposals  to  applicants
who are successful in attracting private capital commitments to pursue commer-
cial  applications  of  the  federal  research.  This  special  consideration  is  given  by
awarding  extra  points  of  merit  to  those  proposals  that  have  attracted  private
sector commitments for follow-on funding.2

It  is  BIO’s  belief  that  restoring  the  eligibility  of  majority  venture-owned  compa-
nies and granting the VCC exclusion from affiliation would not adversely affect the
ability of small business concerns without such private capital to compete for SBIR
awards. However, restricting VCC-backed companies from participating in the grant
program  will  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  the  quality  of  applications  and
the type of science that will be studied. The United States’ global leadership in bio-
technology will be threatened if the Federal Government’s role in promoting critical
research  and  development  through  programs  such  as  the  SBIR  program  is  limited.
BIO has no desire to limit the SBIR grant program so small biotechnology compa-
nies  without  venture  capital  funding  will  be  ineligible.  On  the  contrary,  BIO  be-
lieves that the enormous promise of biotechnology research and development merits
exploration and investment on a variety of fronts and by a spectrum of creative, dy-
namic,  and  dedicated  entities.  Biotechnology  is  a  fertile  field,  from  which  patients
can  reap  huge  benefits—if  it  is  supported  by  both  public  and  private  investment.
The  rewards  of  biotechnology  are  limitless,  unless  we  choose  to  limit  them  by  lim-
iting who can participate in this venture.

Preventing  such  limits  includes  removing  barriers  to  participation  in  the  SBIR
program.  To  do  this,  BIO  urges  a  revision  of  the  SBIR  eligibility  requirements  to
reflect  Congress’  original  intent  to  encourage  awards  to  small  businesses  that  have
successfully attracted outside investors. BIO supports H.R. 2943, the Save America’s
Biotechnology Innovative Research (SABIR) Act, introduced by Rep. Sam Graves (R–
MO).  This  bill  would  amend  the  Small  Business  Act  to  require  SBA  to  broaden  its
SBIR Small Business Size Standard, to permit appropriate venture capital financing
by venture capital funds that are (1) not dominant and (2) not controlled by a large
pharmaceutical  or  other  company.  BIO  stands  ready  to  assist  the  Subcommittee  in
ensuring  that  the  U.S.  remains  the  global  leader  in  the  field  of  biotechnology.  We
thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

SAMPLE  PROJECTS  CANCELED  OR  ON  HOLD  AS  A  RE-
SULT OF SBIR INELIGIBILITY DUE TO VENTURE BACK-
ING

Protection Against SARS Virus

A  company  has  developed  a  therapy  against  the  SARS  virus  that  is  several  hun-
dred times better than other compounds that have been reported. This therapy will
provide protection against spread of SARS virus within an individual and, as a con-
sequence,  the  spread  of  virus  between  individuals.  The  therapy  is  directed  toward
those who have been exposed and can be used to contain the spread of the disease.
Support for this potential therapeutic is needed to provide animal testing resources,
manufacturing,  formulation,  and  other  toxicity  testing  before  being  brought  for
human clinical trials.
Protection Against Anthrax Infection

A company has discovered that a potential drug that is effective in protecting or-
gans  from  the  injury  caused  by  lack  of  oxygen  or  too  much  oxygen  is  also  effective
in  protecting  animals  against  anthrax  infection.  Survival  of  the  animals  was  in-
creased  significantly  after  anthrax  infection  in  an  animal  model  with  compound
treatment. This provides the therapeutic opportunity to slow or prevent some of the
initial  damage  to  the  infected  person  and  provide  an  increased  time  for  antibiotics
to  become  effective.  Support  for  additional  animal  testing  of  the  compound  in  con-
junction with antibiotics would provide the evidence needed to proceed toward clin-
ical development.
Therapy to Decrease Injury Due to Stroke or Heart Attack

A  potential  drug  has  been  discovered  that  decreased  the  size  of  injury  by  50  per-
cent to the heart and to the brain in separate models of heart attack or stroke. The
compound  was  delivered  at  the  time  when  the  blockage  is  released  which  is  the
therapeutically  relevant  time  of  application.  By  reducing  the  size  of  injury  by  50
percent, the long-term deleterious effects due to a stroke or heart attack should also
be reduced allowing a better functional recovery. Support is needed to advance this
compound for additional animal testing for potential toxicities which is required be-
fore advancing into human clinical trials.
Novel and New Approaches for Anti-cancer Drugs

A  company  has  developed  a  technology  and  demonstrated  that  it  can  discover
anti-cancer  agents  that  will  attack  cancers  by  new  and  different  approaches  than
have  been  previously  reported.  Cancer  cells  can  be  killed  by  activating  an  internal
cell  suicide  signal  which  is  normally  off.  This  company  has  developed  a  procedure
to  identify  the  many  different  ways  by  which  this  cellular  suicide  signal  can  be
turned on. These new anti-cancer agents act in ways that are totally different from
current  drugs  and  attack  cancers  by  different  avenues.  One  of  the  potential  drugs
the company has discovered is highly selective for breast and colorectal cancers and
does not affect normal cells or other types of cancers, and it may be anticipated that
it would have less toxic side effects. Grant support would increase the speed of iden-
tification  of  other  interesting  drugs  and  their  novel  pathways  to  bring  them  more
rapidly toward clinical development.
Stem Cell Research to Treat Chronic Wounds

A  small  publicly-traded  biotechnology  company  did  not  qualify  for  a  $1.0  million
SBIR  grant  to  study  the  potential  benefit  of  adult  stem  cells  for  treating  chronic
wounds, for which there exists a major unmet medical need. The NIH approved the
research, however because a majority of the company’s major shareholders are U.S.-
based investment funds, the company had to withdraw its application since it could
not  show  that  greater  than  50  percent  of  its  shares  were  held  by  individual  U.S.
citizens.
Technology for Rapid HIV Detection

A company was working to develop a rapid test for HIV for quicker earlier detec-
tion. This proposal has been shelved due to the great costs and troubles anticipated
with being unable to receive sufficient grant funding.
Plastic Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)

A company has developed manufacturing concepts that could result in significant
decreases  in  costs  of  certain  types  of  scientific  instrumentation.  In  particular,  this

company  wishes  to  develop  a  low  cost  AFM  for  more  general  use  than  the  higher
price  research  grade  instruments  currently  in  place.  This  proposal  has  been  aban-
doned.
Multi-analyte Arrays for HIV Detection

This  proposal  was  to  use  the  ultramicroarray  technology  to  construct  capture  do-
mains  against  all  of  the  major  HIV  proteins  and  their  antibodies  on  a  single  chip.
This will enable simultaneously detection from very small sample volumes. This was
just submitted as an RO1 (not a business grant program), which reduces probability
of funding significantly.
Detection of Human Cytokines for Cancer Therapy

Based  on  mouse  models,  this  proposal  was  to  detect  biomarkers  for  cancer  using
an  ultra-miniaturized  platform  that  translates  into  minimal  invasiveness  and  en-
hanced utility. This proposal has been abandoned.
Cancer Biomarker Detection

This  proposal  was  to  use  the  company’s  ultra-miniaturized  biomarker  detection
platform  (the  company  has  detected  PSA—and  cancer  biomarker—from  just  four
cells) to cancer detection and monitoring and to enhance laser capture micro-dissec-
tion  capabilities  (the  ability  to  do  protein  analysis  on  very  small  numbers  of  cells).
This proposal has been abandoned.
Staph  A  Heteropolymer  for  Prevention  and  Treatment  of  Staphylococcus

Aureus Bacteremia

The  Staph  A  HP  heteropolymer  will  be  developed  for  prevention  of  infection  in
hemodialysis,  cancer,  HIV  and  other  patients  receiving  a  catheter  and  who  are  at
risk for infection.
HIV Heteropolymer Therapeutic

A company plans to undertake a study to evaluate whether a heteropolymer con-
taining an HIV specific non-neutralizing antibody can clear a Simian/Human hybrid
HIV  like  virus  from  infected  cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  HIV  heteropolymer  will  be
developed as a therapeutic treatment for HIV infected individuals to be used to sup-
plement existing treatments.
Candida Heteropolymer Therapeutic

A  company  plans  to  develop  a  Heteropolymer  drug  for  the  treatment  of  blood-

borne Candida infections.
Human Polyclonal Antibodies in Genetically Modified Pigs

Production of fully human polyclonal antibodies in genetically modified pigs—Pigs
are engineered using cloning technology to make potent human antibodies as a new
class of therapeutics for infectious disease applications, for antibiotic resistant infec-
tions, and biowarfare countermeasures.
Vitality Chromosome

A  mini-chromosome  for  soybean  containing  a  set  of  genes  to  increase  expression
of omega-3 fatty acids, and phytosterols to improve oil quality for human consump-
tion of soy oil products.
Identity Preservation for Consumer Products in Modified Crops

Development of a panel of visually and genetically coupled markers for identifying
specialty  traits  in  crops  for  consumer  use,  such  as  plastics,  pharmaceuticals  or  nu-
tritional products. Autonomous mini-chromosomes carrying value-added traits would
also  carry  linked  sets  of  unique  PCR  markers  and  near  ultraviolet  or  visible  pig-
ments for easy identification of product specific crops to assist in identifying preser-
vation, processing and distribution control.
Mini-chromosome for Ethanol Production From Corn

A  mini-chromosome  for  corn  containing  genes  for  three  enzymes  that  would  im-
prove  the  conversion  efficiency  of  plant  materials,  including  grain,  stover  and  cel-
lulosic materials from other plant sources.
