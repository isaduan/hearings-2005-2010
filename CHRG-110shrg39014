TRANSPORTATION  WORKER  IDENTIFICATION 

CREDENTIAL  (TWIC)  IMPLEMENTATION 

THURSDAY,  APRIL  12,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:00  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Daniel  K.  Inouye, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 

The  CHAIRMAN.  The  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Cre-
dential  program,  the  TWIC,  has  been  under  development  since 
2001,  and  despite  $99.4  million  in  appropriations  from  Congress, 
unfortunately  the  program  still  is  languishing  at  the  Department 
of Homeland Security. 

In  our  last  hearing  on  this  subject  about  a  year  ago,  we  heard 
testimony  about  severe  cost  over-runs,  contract  mismanagement, 
excessive  personnel  turnover,  poor  communications  and  ineffective 
planning.  At  this  hearing,  we  will  examine  whether  the  Transpor-
tation Security Administration and the United States Coast Guard 
have taken actions to address those criticisms. 

Additionally,  I  hope  to  hear  how  the  agencies  plan  to  deploy  the 
biometric  card  enrollment  and  issuance  process,  just  as  impor-
tantly, how the agencies plan to execute the pilot program for card- 
reader technology. 

While  I  do  not  want  to  dwell  on  the  mistakes  of  the  past,  this 
Committee  needs  assurance  that  the  Administration  has  taken  se-
riously the mismanagement of the TWIC program. Given that com-
prehensive management plan for TWIC required in the Intelligence 
Reform Act of 2004 is over two years past due, I can only conclude 
that  the  Administration  is  not  taking  its  responsibility  seriously 
enough.  If  the  agencies  continue  to  neglect  the  basic  tenets  of  con-
tract management and programmatic planning, failure is certain to 
follow. 

Completion  of  this  program  is  a  crucial  step  towards  improving 

the security of our ports. And so, failure is unacceptable. 

When  Congress  considered  the  SAFE  Port  Act,  we  established 
implementation  deadlines  in  consultation  with  the  Department  of 
Homeland  Security.  We  did  not  want  to  impose  a  set  of  deadlines 
that  the  agencies  would  not  be  able  to  achieve.  Working  collabo-
ratively,  we  required  TWIC  enrollment  at  the  Nation’s  top  ten 
high-risk  ports  by  July  1,  2007.  As  of  today,  we  do  not  have  even

the  most  basic  deployment  schedule.  However,  I  am  informed  that 
enrollment  scheduled  to  begin  in  Wilmington,  Delaware,  in  late 
March has been postponed until late May, at best. 

We are all concerned that the low estimates of the population af-
fected by the program are not realistic. This estimate is significant, 
in that it will determine the number of enrollment stations the con-
tractor  sets  up  and  the  number  of  trusted  agents  the  contractor 
hires to process employees. An underestimate of the affected popu-
lation  would  thus  cause  a  domino  effect,  resulting  in  long  wait 
times  at  the  enrollment  stations,  poor  customer  service,  and  ulti-
mately  a  slowing  of  the  flow  of  commerce  as  labor  circulates 
through a clogged enrollment and card issuance process. 

As  we  move  forward  with  testing  and  implementing  card-reader 
technology  in  the  rough  maritime  environment,  the  TSA  and  the 
Coast Guard must appropriately balance their multiple missions of 
safety,  security  and  efficiency  for  both  facilities  and  vessels.  The 
card  reader  system  cannot  slow  the  flow  of  commerce  through  our 
terminals.  The  security  practices  the  Department  puts  into  place 
cannot compromise crew safety. 

I  can  appreciate  the  challenges  associated  with  addressing  these 
divergent  issues.  It  is  a  difficult  balancing  act.  However,  after  six 
years and $99.4 million, we still do not have access controls in our 
ports.  I’m  certain  all  agree  that  we  need  to  get  this  program  on 
track,  and  on  schedule,  for  the  safety  and  security  of  our  Nation. 

[The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
The  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  program  has  been 
under development since 2001 and despite $99.4 million in appropriations from Con-
gress, it is still languishing at the Department of Homeland Security. 

In  our  last  hearing  on  this  subject  almost  1  year  ago,  we  heard  testimony  about

commerce  as  labor  circulates  through  a  clogged  enrollment  and  card  issuance  proc-
ess. 

As we move forward with testing and implementing card reader technology in the 
rough maritime environment, the TSA and the Coast Guard must appropriately bal-
ance their multiple missions of safety, security and efficiency for both facilities and 
vessels. The card reader systems cannot slow the flow of commerce through our ter-

on schedule, for the safety and security of our Nation. 

Senator Stevens? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will have to leave 
here  almost  immediately,  but  I  did  want  to  stop  by  and  state  that 
I am encouraged that some progress has been made on this Trans-
portation  Worker  Identification  Credential,  TWIC,  since  our  hear-
ing  took  place  a  little  over  a  year  ago.  In  January,  I  understand 
the final rules were issued for the biometric smart card to be used 
in the TWIC program. The Coast Guard is developing a process for 
expedited  temporary  clearance  for  newly-hired  port  and  vessel 
workers. And, stakeholders indicate that communication within the 
Transportation Security Administration, TSA, has improved signifi-
cantly. There is, however, room for improvement. 

Over  four  years  have  passed  since  the  first  legislative  mandate 
requiring  the  development  of  this  program,  TWIC.  Most  recently, 
the  SAFE  Port  Act  established  a  timeline  for  deployment  of  the 
program  to  begin  at  10  ports  no  later  than  July  of  this  year.  It  is 
now my understanding that this statutory deadline, which was de-
veloped in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security 
and TSA, will likely not be met. 

Our  Nation’s  ability  to  secure  our  ports  largely  rest  in  part  on 
our  ability  to  timely  verify  and  identify  our  port  workers  and  to 
prevent unauthorized access to these secure maritime areas. 

Absent  this  ability,  port  operations  will  remain  at  risk.  The  pro-
gram is a complex undertaking. TSA and the Coast Guard and oth-
ers  are  trying  to  ensure  that  we  do  have  secure  port  operations. 
The  Congressional  tolerance,  I’m  sure  you’re  aware,  is  waning  be-
cause of the missed deadlines. 

I do have to leave, as I said. I look forward to reviewing the testi-
mony  from  our  witnesses,  particularly  their  suggestions  on  how  to 
get the program back on track and keep it on track. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Senator Lautenberg? 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank  you.  Not  to  be  repetitious,  but  as  I  listened  to  the  Chair-
man’s statement, we are talking about similar things, in our views, 
and we can’t leave this situation as it is. It presents too many risks 
for our society. And, so when we talk about the failures of the past, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

it’s  simply  to  make  sure  that  we  understand  what  hasn’t  taken 
place  that  should  have  taken  place.  And,  to  get  an  examination  of 
what’s required. That’s the most important thing. 

The  Delaware  River  port  system  in  South  Jersey  is  the  busiest 
crude oil tanker port in the United States and it’s the third busiest 
in  the  world.  The  Port  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey  is  the  largest 
port  on  the  East  Coast  and  it’s  the  second  busiest  container  port 
in  the  country.  And,  Northern  New  Jersey’s  port  sits  alongside  an 
area  that  has  been  defined  as  the  two  most  dangerous  miles  in 
America for terrorism, according to the FBI. 

Now, New Jersey’s ports are vital to our region, not only vital to 
our  region,  but  our  national  economies  as  well.  And,  the  security 
of  the  vessels  that  dock  there,  longshoreman  who  work  there  and 
surrounding communities are even more critical to me. It’s an area 
that  is  home  to—whether  during  their  business  or  residential 
hours—to approximately 12 million people. So, we’ve got to be very 
arduous  in  terms  of  getting  this  program  underway,  it’s  essential. 
The White House has had a chance to demonstrate their commit-
ment  to  port  security  by  getting  the  TWIC  program  up  and  run-
ning.  But,  instead  of  making  this  program  a  success,  the  Adminis-
tration has let it become another example of mismanagement, poor 
planning, and neglect of our Nation’s security. 

Almost  6  years  after  9/11,  only  1,700—one  thousand  seven  hun-
dred—are  known  to  be  in  the  hands  of  cardholders,  that’s  after  6 
years,  almost  6  years.  And  the  Bush  Administration  has  spent,  as 
the  Chairman  said  in  his  comments,  nearly  $100  million  admin-
istering  this  program.  That,  my  friends,  is  nearly  $60,000  a  card 
they’ve spent. 

With  so  many  workers  lacking  their  TWIC  cards,  the  Bush  Ad-
ministration tried to conduct more basic security measures by run-
ning the names of port workers against the Nation’s Terror Watch 
List. But, while the Administration did background checks on dock 
workers with access to secure areas of the port, they failed to check 
truck  drivers—so  numerous—with  access  to  the  same  secure  areas 
of the port. 

With  the  help  of  Chairman  Inouye  and  Vice  Chairman  Stevens, 
I  secured  language  in  last  year’s  SAFE  Port  Act,  to  require  them 
to  include  truck  drivers,  to  get  this  right,  by  January  2007.  But, 
thus far, the law has been ignored by the Administration. And now, 
to  try  and  get  TWIC  back  on  track,  the  Administration  wants  to 
charge employees for their IDs, at a cost of $135 apiece. 

Worse  still,  we  have  no  assurance  that  our  ports  will  have  the 
technology  to  scan  these  biometric  cards,  because  the  President 
didn’t  request  any  funding  for  it.  This  kind  of  mismanagement  is 
not fair to our workers, it’s not fair to our ports, it’s not fair to our 
communities,  and  it’s  not  the  level  of  security  that  we  need  in  our 
country. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator  SMITH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  all  your  good 

work, and for holding this hearing. 

I  thank  our  witnesses,  also,  for  being  here  today.  It  has  been  a 

long road getting to this point. 

When  we  first  mandated  the  issuance  of  the  biometric  transpor-
tation security card, known as TWIC, as part of the 2002 Maritime 
Transportation  Security  Act,  I  was—at  that  time—the  Ranking 
Member on the Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Sub-
committee.  After  a  hiatus  of  4  years,  I’m  once  again  the  Ranking 
Member. And, unfortunately, we’re still dealing with the TWIC pro-
gram implementation. 

No question, there have been mistakes along the way and it’s un-
derstandable  given  all  of  the  difficulties  and  complexities  of  start-
ing  up  a  Department  like  Homeland  Security.  The  fact  remains, 
that  we’re  entrusted  as  stewards  of  the  public’s  fiscal  resources, 
and  more  importantly,  in  providing  for  the  safety  and  security  of 
the American people. 

The  SAFE  Port  Act  mandated  the  Transportation  Security  Ad-
ministration  rollout  the  TWIC  program  at  10  U.S.  ports  later  this 
year. The Port of Portland, in my home State of Oregon is not one 
of  those  ports  selected  for  the  initial  phase,  the  roll-out,  but  I’m 
told  the  Port’s  Maritime  Security  Manager  is  meeting  with  the 
TWIC  contractor  this  morning  to  talk  about  the  implementation 
schedule for Portland. So I, along with folks back home in Oregon, 
am watching this phase of the roll-out very closely with the expec-
tation that it will soon be Portland’s turn. 

I believe that TWIC is an important program, and it’s important 
to  get  it  right,  so  for  that  reason,  I  know  we’re  holding  this  hear-
ing, and again, I thank you for that, Mr. Chairman. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much.  This  morning  we  have 
two  panels,  the  first  panel  consists  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of 
Transportation  Security  Administration,  Mr.  Ed  ‘‘Kip’’  Hawley, 
from  the  United  States  Coast  Guard;  Rear  Admiral  Brian  Salerno; 
and  the  Managing  Director  of  the  Homeland  Security  and  Justice 
Issues,  Government  Accountability  Office,  Mr.  Norman  J.  Rabkin. 

And, I call upon Secretary Hawley. 

STATEMENT OF HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY, 

ASSISTANT SECRETARY, TRANSPORTATION SECURITY 

ADMINISTRATION, DHS 

Mr. HAWLEY. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, thank you and mem-
bers of the Committee, Ranking Member Smith. Thank you for this 
opportunity  to  discuss  the  TWIC  program.  I’m  pleased  to  be  here 
this  morning  with  Admiral  Brian  Salerno,  our  partner  from  the 
Coast  Guard,  and  Norm  Rabkin  from  the  Government  Account-
ability Office. 

I’d  like  to  spend  a  little  bit  of  time  talking  in  detail  about  the 
program  overall,  its  technology,  business  process  and  timetable. 
But to start off, I think I should answer one fundamental question, 
which is why is this taking so long?

In  a  city  where  most  of  us  wear  one  or  more  security  ID  cards, 
what is so hard about producing a TWIC? There are four major dif-
ferences from this kind of a card. 

First, TWIC uses the latest, most advanced Federal Government 
biometric standard, and for the first time, applies it to the commer-
cial  sector.  Second,  TWIC  issues  cards  that  work  anywhere  in  the 
Nation’s private port environment, by anyone working there, across 
companies,  and  industries.  Third,  TWIC  has  not  only  unparalleled 
flexibility,  it  has  massive  scale.  Somewhere  in  the  realm  of  1  mil-
lion  cardholders  in  3,200  ports.  In  comparison  with  our  prototype 
project,  we  will  process  in  one  day,  more  credentials  than  we  did 
in one year, under the prototype. 

Finally, TWIC security checks will be integrated into all of TSA’s 
vetting  programs,  which  means  that  we  can  connect  the  dots 
throughout  the  entire  transportation  sector.  TWIC  is  an  advanced, 
sophisticated,  credentialing  system.  In  other  words,  the  hard  part 
is not the card, it is the network behind the card. 

Breaking  new  ground  in  technology  has  obvious  advantages,  but 
it  always  brings  schedule  risks,  and  TWIC  is  no  different.  Three 
developments  in  the  last  year  have  made  this  project  even  more 
complex. First, we made the decision to bring TWIC into alignment 
with  a  new  Federal  Government  biometric  standard  called  FIPS 
201.  Second,  we  identified  and  closed  potential  data  privacy  gaps, 
as of this past February. And third, working with the Coast Guard, 
we  incorporated  more  than  1,900  comments  received  during  our 
rulemaking process, into the detailed blueprint for TWIC. That rule 
became final several weeks ago. 

On  top  of  the  challenges  I  mentioned  of  introducing  new  tech-
nology  on  a  massive  scale,  while  at  the  same  time,  making  the 
three  major  program  adjustments,  we  have  one  more  additional 
complexity,  and  it  is  a  big  one.  We  will  connect  TWIC  into  what 
we call the screening gateway. 

As you know, TSA vets many different people in different indus-
tries—aviation,  truck  drivers,  now  maritime—and  in  order  not  to 
miss potential links among them, we now use a centralized vetting 
system. So, in turning TWIC on, we must be absolutely certain that 
we  do  not  jeopardize  the  stability  or  security  of  this  larger  vetting 
system. The only way to be sure is to flight-test TWIC extensively. 
All  of  the  internal  moving  parts  to  TWIC  must  work  together, 
and they must work in combination with the larger screening gate-
way. Rigorous performance testing is the only way to know for sure 
that  TWIC  is  ready  to  go  live.  That’s  where  we  are  in  the  process, 
and what remains is the testing. 

Everybody  wants  to  know  when  TWIC  enrollments  will  start, 
and we are all very mindful of the SAFE Port Act deadline of July 
1 to enroll 10 ports in TWIC. So, where are we on that? 

TSA has already conducted—as Senator Lautenberg mentioned— 
Watch Lists and immigration checks for over 750,000 port workers, 
and  will  do  it  again  over  the  Summer  to  keep  that  assessment 
fresh.  I  believe  that  addresses  the  near-term,  real-world  security 
concerns  about  the  current  workforce,  even  before  the  cards  are 
issued. 

For  us,  the  stakes  are  enormously  high.  For  the  people  who  pay 
for  these  cards,  and  use  them  daily  to  enter  workplaces  and  jobs,

they are also high. Out of respect for these employees and the busi-
nesses, we must spend the time to ensure that the program is test-
ed,  fully  integrated,  and  does  not  compromise  security  in  any 
linked system. 

We  respect  the  deadline,  and  April  is  too  soon  to  give  up  on  a 
July deadline. But, if it is a choice between meeting that deadline, 
and program integrity, we will choose the latter. 

We have a strong new team onboard from Lockheed Martin with 
excellent program support from TSA and the Coast Guard. The in-
dustry  and  its  workers  have  been  forthcoming  and  constructive. 
For  commerce,  TWIC  means  that  thousands  of  independent  busi-
nesses  will  have  one,  interoperable  security  network  for  the  first 
time in history. 

We  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  to  ensure  the 

success of the TWIC program, and port security, generally. 

Thank you for the opportunity, I’d be happy to answer questions. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hawley follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 

TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, DHS 

Good morning Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, and distinguished mem-
bers of the Committee. Thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about the 
Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. 

I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  leadership  this  committee  has  provided  in  defin-
ing  the  vision  and  requirements  for  TWIC.  The  TWIC  program  is  moving  aggres-
sively toward its objectives with a focus on making good security and business deci-
sions.  This  leading  edge  program  is  developing  essential  processes,  capabilities  and 
expertise that will be beneficial to other programs. 

The  final  rule  for  TWIC  went  into  effect  on  March  26,  2007.  With  the  passing  of 
this  critical  milestone,  this  hearing  provides  an  excellent  opportunity  to  highlight 
program  developments  and  describe  how  we  are  incorporating  our  lessons  learned 
into an effective, efficient business plan for TWIC enrollment. 

We  have  framed  our  program  decisions  and  processes  within  the  context  of  the 

Nation’s port security goals, including the need to: 

assessment; 

tion of the credential holder; 

• Identify  authorized  individuals  who  require  unescorted  access  to  secure  areas 
of  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  (MTSA)  regulated  facilities  and  ves-
sels; 
• Determine  the  eligibility  of  an  individual  for  access  through  a  security  threat 
• Ensure unauthorized individuals are denied access through biometric confirma-
• Revoke access promptly for individuals who fail to maintain their eligibility; 
• Apply privacy and security controls to protect TWIC information; and, 
• Fund the program entirely by user-fees. 
Achieving  these  ambitious  goals  has  required  creative  planning,  flexible  imple-
mentation,  effective  stakeholder  communication,  and  adaptive  contract  manage-
ment. The basic program deployment philosophy has been a commitment to evaluate 
all  practicable  technical  alternatives  that  will  provide  adequate  port  security  and 
minimize  adverse  impacts,  either  economically  or  logistically,  to  our  Nation’s  citi-
zens  and  our  international  trading  system.  This  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be 
the program’s implementation premise. 
TWIC Milestones to Date 

An estimated 750,000 workers currently have unescorted access to our ports. The 
central  technical  TWIC  challenge  is  providing  facilities  and  vessels  with  a  reliable 
tool  for  identifying  individuals  who  have  been  granted  authorized  access  to  our 
ports.  Simply  put,  TSA  has  been  tasked  with  the  development  of  a  21st  century 
identification system. The key element of the system is a card that includes biomet-
ric  technology  that  makes  it  virtually  impossible  for  the  card  to  be  used  by  anyone 
other than the person to whom the card was issued.

The technical principle underlying TWIC’s ability to authenticate a person’s iden-
tity includes three factors. When using the full extent of TWIC’s authentication abil-
ity each person can be identified by: 

• Something they know—a worker’s Personal Identification Number (PIN); 
• Something they have—the TWIC credential; and 
• Something they are—a biometric. 
Obviously,  new  processes  and  technologies  require  systematic  pilot  studies.  The 
prototype  study  was  deployed  to  26  locations  in  the  areas  of  Los  Angeles/Long 
Beach, Wilmington/Philadelphia and Florida’s deepwater ports. The prototype TWIC 
was  successfully  issued  to  more  than  4,000  volunteer  workers  including  truck  driv-
ers,  longshoremen,  container  terminal,  railway,  and  airport  personnel.  A  name- 
based  threat  assessment  was  completed  on  each  individual.  A  criminal  background 
check  was  conducted  by  the  State  of  Florida  for  the  deep-water  port  volunteers. 
These  efforts  were  a  success  on  multiple  levels;  it  provided  invaluable  experience 
and a much deeper understanding of the technical and logistical challenges. 

Security improvements could not wait until TWIC is fully deployed. We have gone 
forward  with  significant  interim  security  enhancements  and  actions  during  TWIC’s 
initial development phase. These actions included: 

• The  Coast  Guard  worked  effectively  with  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory 
Committee  (NMSAC)  to  define  secure  areas.  This  definition  will  have  a  direct 
impact on over 10,000 vessels and more than 3,200 facilities. These secure areas 
delineate where a TWIC will be required for unescorted access. 

• The  joint  rulemaking  process  between  the  Coast  Guard  and  TSA  was  acceler-
ated resulting in TWIC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) being published 
on May 22, 2006. 

• The Coast Guard and TSA worked with industry partners to develop an interim 
process that compares a worker’s biographical information against our terrorist 
watch lists and immigration databases. 

• Facility  owners,  facility  operators  and  unions  submitted  worker  names,  date  of 
birth,  and,  as  appropriate,  alien  identification  number.  The  worker’s  immigra-
tion status was checked by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service using 
its Central Index. 

• To  date  TSA  has  completed  740,000  name-based  threat  assessments  on  port 
workers  and  longshoreman.  These  assessments  were  an  interim  measure  and 
did  not  include  the  criminal  history  records  check  or  biometric  credential  that 
is part of TWIC. 

TWIC Rule and Stakeholder Input 

The  TWIC  rule  was  posted  on  the  TSA  and  Coast  Guard  websites  on  January  1, 
2007,  and  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  January  25,  2007.  The  rule  is  the 
result  of  extensive  public  involvement  and  interagency  coordination.  In  addition  to 
the direct involvement of the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee, TSA 
and  the  Coast  Guard  held  four  public  meetings  in  Newark,  NJ;  Tampa,  FL;  St. 
Louis, MO; and Long Beach, CA. Over 1,900 comments were received from workers, 
port  owners  and  operators,  small  businesses  and  others  affected  by  the  new  pro-
gram.  All  comments  were  carefully  considered  and  we  made  significant  changes  to 
the NPRM in the development of the Final Rule. These changes include: 

• The  Coast  Guard  and  TSA  delayed  the  requirement  to  purchase  and  install 
electronic readers to allow for additional field testing, technology improvements, 
and more public comment. 

• We  created  an  expedited  interim  threat  assessment  process  for  new  hires  so 

that they may go to work pending completion of the full threat assessment. 

• We  expanded  the  immigration  requirements  to  permit  certain  visa-holders  who 

are prevalent in the maritime industry to apply for TWIC. 

In  addition,  the  TWIC  NPRM  and  Final  Rule  include  provisions  that  respond  to 
comments we received from workers subject to similar threat assessment programs. 
These include: 

• Creating  a  new  process  where  TSA  can  make  a  determination  that  a  security 
threat  assessment  conducted  by  another  government  agency  is  comparable, 
eliminating redundancy and reducing costs for workers; 

• Providing workers more time to apply for an appeal or waiver;

• Streamlining  the  process,  jointly  with  the  Coast  Guard,  for  merchant  mariner 
credentialing  and  ensuring  that  there  was  no  duplication  of  requirements  re-
sulting from the TWIC process. 

TWIC cards will be required not only for port facility workers, but for anyone who 
seeks  unescorted  access  to  secure  areas  of  a  MTSA  regulated  facility  or  vessel,  re-
gardless  of  frequency.  The  workers  covered  by  this  rule  include  certain  truck  driv-
ers,  rail  employees,  security  guards,  longshoremen,  as  well  as  all  U.S.  merchant 
mariners.  TSA  will  use  the  time  tested  security  assessment  procedures  and  stand-
ards that are currently used for commercial motor vehicle drivers licensed to trans-
port  hazardous  materials,  known  as  Hazardous  Material  Endorsements  (HME).  In 
short,  TWIC  will  be  issued  to  workers  who  successfully  complete  a  security  threat 
assessment, which includes: (1) a check against terrorist watch lists, (2) an immigra-
tion status check, and (3) a FBI fingerprint-based criminal history records check. 

TWIC Card Readers 

The TWIC rule does not currently include a requirement for owners and operators 
to use card readers. This was done as a response to important public comments re-
ceived  on  the  NPRM  and  concerns  from  Congress  expressed  in  the  SAFE  Port  Act. 
The card reader requirement is being formulated and coordinated by extensive tech-
nical input from industry and the public. In the interim, workers seeking unescorted 
access  to  secure  areas  will  present  their  cards  to  authorized  personnel,  who  will 
compare  the  photo,  inspect  security  features  on  the  card,  and  evaluate  the  card  for 
signs  of  tampering.  At  facilities  with  various  sophisticated  access  control  systems, 
the magnetic stripe on the credential could be used to grant or deny access at entry 
gates.  The  Coast  Guard  will  also  institute  periodic  unannounced  checks  to  confirm 
the identity of the holder of the TWIC. 

We  will  continue  to  work  closely  with  all  interested  parties  to  address  the  ever 
evolving  technology  issues.  The  TWIC  technical  architecture  is  compatible  with 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 and Federal Information Proc-
essing  Standards  (FIPS)  201–1  requirements  which  provide  an  open  standard  that 
will  ensure  interoperability  and  real-time  exchange  for  supply  chain  security  co-
operation  between  the  Department  and  the  private  sector.  The  applicant’s  photo-
graph, name, TWIC expiration date, and a unique credential number are printed on 
the card. An integrated circuit chip on the card stores two fingerprint minutia tem-
plates  and  a  PIN  as  well  as  a  digital  photo  of  the  applicant,  the  applicant’s  name, 
and  card  expiration.  The  embedded  computer  chip  is  capable  of  being  read  by  both 
contact and contactless card readers and also contains the magnetic strip and linear 
bar codes. 

In addition to previously conducted prototype testing, pilot test planning and dis-
cussions with interested port, facility, and vessel operators began late last year. The 
pilots  will  test  access  control  technologies  in  real-world  marine  environments.  The 
National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee  is  providing  invaluable  input  re-
garding  operational  requirements  and  has  recommended  specifications 
for 
contactless  biometric  smart  cards  and  card  readers.  Public  feedback  is  being  col-
lected and analyzed on the recommendations. As part of the outreach efforts for the 
TWIC  program  and  the  Department’s  Port  Security  Grant  Program  we  have  met 
with  a  number  of  maritime  interests  to  invite  their  participation  in  the  pilot  tests. 
Our objective is to include pilot test participants that are representative of a variety 
of  facility  and  vessel  types  and  sizes  which  operate  in  a  variety  of  geographic  loca-
tions and environmental conditions. There appears to be sufficient interest from the 
maritime community to achieve this objective. 

The  Department  is  currently  reviewing  Port  Security  Grant  applications  relating 
to  these  pilot  studies  and  will  announce  awards  later  this  spring.  While  the  grant 
process is proceeding, TSA and Coast Guard are working with Department test and 
evaluation experts to develop a comprehensive plan that addresses the unique pilot 
test  challenges.  The  evaluation  of  the  pilot  tests  will  greatly  facilitate  the  Depart-
ment’s efforts to propose a TWIC reader requirement rule that effectively addresses 
security  requirements,  maintains  the  flow  of  commerce,  and  protects  the  personal 
information used to validate the TWIC holder’s identity. 
Rollout Contract 

A  key  operational  piece  of  the  rollout  plan  was  the  award  of  a  competitively  bid, 
indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation. The 
TWIC  enrollment  and  systems  operations  and  maintenance  contract  will  include  a 
Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) that establishes detailed metrics to be 
monitored through the life of the contract and will determine whether the contractor 
will receive any award fee for services performed.

10 

Lockheed  Martin  will  establish  approximately  130  enrollment  centers  near  the 
port facilities where applicants will provide biographic information and fingerprints. 
This information will be transferred to TSA so we may conduct a threat assessment 
involving  checks  of  criminal  history,  immigration,  and  intelligence  databases.  Once 
a worker successfully completes the threat assessment process, the government will 
produce  the  credential  and  send  it  to  the  enrollment  center,  where  the  worker  will 
retrieve  it.  TWIC  enrollment  will  begin  initially  at  select  ports  based  on  risk  and 
other  factors  and  will  proceed  throughout  the  Nation  over  the  next  18–24  months. 
TWIC Card Costs 

As  required  by  Congress,  the  costs  of  the  program  will  be  borne  by  TWIC  appli-
cants.  Therefore,  we  are  obligated  to  look  for  practicable  ways  of  controlling  costs, 
eliminating duplicative processes, providing timely decisions, and, most importantly, 
ensuring accuracy and fairness. 

The fees for a TWIC will be slightly lower than was anticipated in the Final Rule. 
A  TWIC  will  be  $137.25  for  a  card  that  is  valid  for  5  years.  Workers  with  current, 
comparable background checks (e.g., HAZMAT, Merchant Mariner Document (MMD) 
or Free and Secure Trade (FAST)) will receive a discounted fee of $105.25. The cost 
of  a  lost,  damaged  or  stolen  credential  is  $36,  although  we  have  solicited  comment 
on raising that fee. 

We fully realize that these costs are not an insignificant amount to some workers. 
However,  we  feel  that  the  costs  compare  very  favorably  with  equivalent  HSPD–12 
compliant  card  fees  and  in  some  instances  may  actually  reduce  the  costs  for  some 
workers. For example, the Coast Guard is in the process of completing a companion 
rule which will consolidate existing mariner credentials and streamline the applica-
tion  process  for  mariners  who  have  already  applied  for  the  TWIC.  This  will  reduce 
the overall cost burden for these workers. Preparations are underway to reduce du-
plication by having TSA provide the Coast Guard with electronic copies of the appli-
cant’s fingerprints, proof of identification, proof of citizenship, photograph, and if ap-
plicable the individual’s criminal record, FBI number and alien registration number. 
This will eliminate the need for TWIC holding mariners to visit a Coast Guard Re-
gional Exam Center to apply for or renew their Merchant Mariner Credential unless 
an examination is required. 
Rollout Communication Plan and Pre-Enrollment 

Effective public communication is fundamental to our rollout plan. The TWIC pro-
gram  office  has  used  the  lessons  learned  from  the  prototype  phase  to  develop  a 
multi-dimensioned  outreach  strategy  for  all  of  the  enrollment  phases.  A  toll-free 
help  desk,  Frequently  Asked  Questions,  informational  brochures,  and  a  centralized 
e-mail  address  will  provide  up-front  assistance  and  guidance  for  workers,  owners, 
and  operators.  These  services  include  program  information,  response  to  enrollment 
questions,  pre-enrollment  assistance,  lost/stolen  card  reporting,  credential  replace-
ment  support,  updates  on  an  individual’s  case,  and  information  on  appeals  and 
waivers.  Applicants  are  encouraged,  but  not  required,  to  ‘‘pre-enroll’’  and  provide 
biographic  information  at  the  secure  TWIC  website  which  should  help  reduce  wait-
ing  time  at  the  enrollment  centers.  An  additional  service  that  is  provided  during 
pre-enrollment  is  an  opportunity  for  the  applicant  to  schedule  an  appointment  for 
appearing at the enrollment center. 

Lockheed  Martin  is  required  by  contract  to  develop  a  communication  plan  to  en-
sure that applicants, operators, and relevant industry associations are educated and 
knowledgeable  about  the  TWIC  enrollment  process.  The  communication  plan  will 
identify TSA goals and responsibilities, contractor goals and responsibilities, port fa-
cility  and  vessel  responsibilities,  target  audiences,  communications  processes,  and 
supporting communication tools. A key plan element is the use of a communication 
committee  to  ensure  sustained  two-way  communication  with  major  stakeholders. 
This  vital  effort  is  calculated  to  provide  the  most  current,  accurate  program  infor-
mation  to  interested  stakeholders  and  provide  a  mechanism  for  continuing  stake-
holder input during the rollout. 
Enrollment Centers 

Enrollment  sites  will  be  operated  by  trusted  agents  who  are  employees  of  a  ven-
dor under contract with TSA. These trained agents will have undergone a TSA secu-
rity  threat  assessment  before  being  allowed  to  collect  the  data.  The  trusted  agents 
will  provide  applicants  with  a  privacy  notice  and  consent  form,  by  which  the  appli-
cant  agrees  to  provide  personal  information  for  the  security  threat  assessment  and 
credential.  The  trusted  agents  will  verify  an  applicant’s  identity,  confirm  the  accu-
racy  of  biographic  information,  collect  biometric  information  (a  full  set  of  finger-
prints  and  a  facial  photograph),  and  obtain  the  applicant’s  signature  on  the  enroll-
ment documents. The contract performance parameter for the trusted advisor enroll-

11 

ment  process  will  be  an  average  enrollment  time  of  15  minutes.  The  enrollment 
process  for  a  pre-enrolled  applicant  is  fully  expected  to  take  less  time.  As  you  can 
see, focused planning that fosters convenience for applicants will benefit workers as 
well as our process efficiencies. 
Data Security Vetting and Card Issuance 

After  enrollment,  an  applicant’s  data  is  sent  to  the  TSA  system,  and  the  vetting 
process (i.e., terrorism database, criminal history records check, immigration check) 
is  started.  We  anticipate  that  the  TWIC  threat  assessment  processing  time  will  be 
similar to our experience in the HME program. Since the inception of the HME pro-
gram, threat assessments have frequently been completed in 3 days or less. During 
this same period the average time for completing HME threat assessments has been 
approximately 14 days, which includes all appeals and waivers. The process will be 
impacted by steps where there is minimum governmental control. For example, ap-
plicants  need  to  promptly  provide  corrected  records,  and  respond  to  initial  deter-
minations. Other factors that we anticipate could result in processing delays include 
an  applicant  providing  incorrect  information,  watch  list  determinations,  evaluation 
of  the  nature  of  threats,  whether  the  applicant  is  currently  under  criminal  inves-
tigation,  and  confirming  immigration  status  that  is  not  available  in  electronic  for-
mat. Nonetheless, the 14 day average for processing the HME assessments includes 
the  time  required  to  meet  the  same  threat  assessment  challenges  that  we  will  face 
with TWIC. 

If  TSA  determines  that  an  applicant  does  not  pose  a  security  threat,  the  appli-
cant’s  information  is  sent  for  card  production.  After  the  card  is  developed  it  is  sent 
to the enrollment center, where the worker will be notified to pick up the card. Due 
to  the  secure  nature  of  the  credential,  the  smart  cards  are  shipped  as  ‘‘inactive.’’ 
An  applicant  must  verify  his  or  her  personal  identity  by  providing  a  biometric  (i.e., 
fingerprint)  that  is  matched  to  the  cards  electronic  template.  After  identity  is 
verified,  the  applicant  selects  a  secret  PIN  which  is  stored  on  the  card  as  an  addi-
tional identity authentication factor. 
Worker Redress/Waivers/Appeals 

If an applicant is denied a TWIC they will be notified of the reason and instructed 
on how to apply for an appeal or waiver. All applicants have the opportunity to ap-
peal a disqualification and may apply to TSA for a waiver. In order to expedite proc-
essing  time,  applicants  who  are  aware  of  a  potential  disqualifying  crime  may  begin 
the waiver process when they initially apply for a TWIC. 

The  standards  for  denial  of  a  TWIC  are  the  same  standards  that  apply  in  the 
HME  process.  Any  applicant  who  is  subject  to  removal  proceedings  or  an  order  of 
removal  under  the  immigration  laws  of  the  United  States  is  not  eligible  to  apply 
for a TWIC. An individual will be disqualified if he or she lacks legal presence and/ 
or authorization to work in the United States, has a connection to terrorist activity, 
or has been determined to lack mental capacity. 

A  person  will  also  be  denied  a  TWIC  for  a  criminal  history  involving  certain  dis-
qualifying  crimes.  TSA  received  valuable  NPRM  comments  on  the  list  of  disquali-
fying crimes and decided to fine tune the list to better reflect crimes that are more 
likely to result in a terrorism security risk or a risk that the individual may engage 
in  a  transportation  security  incident.  Permanent  disqualifying  criminal  offenses  in-
clude:  espionage,  sedition,  treason,  terrorism,  improper  transportation  of  a  haz-
ardous  material,  unlawful  possession,  use  or  sale  of  an  explosive,  murder,  threats 
to a place of public use (government facility, public transportation system, or infra-
structure facility), violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations 
(RICO)  Act  in  which  the  predicate  act  is  one  of  the  permanently  disqualifying 
crimes, or a crime involving a transportation security incident. A transportation se-
curity  incident  is  a  security  incident  resulting  in  a  significant  loss  of  life,  environ-
mental  damage,  transportation  system  disruption,  or  economic  disruption  in  a  par-
ticular area. 

Individuals  are  ineligible  for  a  TWIC  if  convicted  in  the  last  7  years  or  incarcer-
ated within the last 5 years of the following crimes: Unlawful possession, use or sale 
of a firearm or other weapon, extortion, fraud, bribery, smuggling, immigration vio-
lations,  distribution  or  importation  of  a  controlled  substance,  arson,  kidnapping  or 
hostage taking, rape or aggravated sexual abuse, assault with intent to kill, robbery, 
RICO violations that do not involve a permanent disqualifying crime. 

The  appeal  process  involves  ensuring  that  the  information  on  which  TSA  bases 
its  threat  assessment  is  completely  accurate.  This  process  allows  the  applicant  to 
correct the record on which that threat assessment occurs. 

Fairness and accuracy in TWIC waiver determinations are further ensured by an 
opportunity for independent review by an Administrative Law Judge. As previously

noted,  the  regulations  provide  a  lengthened  period  for  appealing  denial  of  waivers, 
from  30  days  to  60  days,  to  accommodate  workers  who  tend  to  travel  for  extended 
periods  of  time.  Furthermore,  the  regulations  allow  a  worker  to  file  a  request  for 
a time extension after the deadline has passed by filing a motion describing the rea-
sons why they were unable to comply with the timeline. The extra procedural meas-
ures  are  intended  to  give  workers  every  reasonable  chance  to  bring  legitimate  con-
cerns and issues to the attention of people who are trying to make the best and cor-
rect decision regarding security risks. 
Lessons Learned and Future Efforts 

The  initial  rollout  of  TWIC  will  be  focused  on  the  maritime  mode.  However,  once 
the  initial  maritime  rollout  is  complete  DHS  will  evaluate  deployment  of  this  pro-
gram in other modes of transportation. The analysis and planning for any resulting 
decision  will  benefit  from  the  experience,  technical  expertise,  and  lessons  learned 
that evolved under the TWIC program. 

There  are  several  vital  lessons  learned  during  the  development  of  this  program 

that must be prominently considered in future efforts: 

• Look  for  efficiencies  in  duplicative  regulatory  processes.  As  noted  previously, 
TSA and Coast Guard are developing procedures for the sharing of mariner fin-
gerprints,  identity  verification,  criminal  history,  and  photographs  for  TWIC 
which is expected to save not only money but time. In addition, merchant mari-
ners  will  no  longer  be  required  to  visit  a  Regional  Exam  Center  to  obtain  and 
renew their credentials, resulting in substantial time and travel savings. 
• Address  the  impact  on  small  businesses.  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  worked 
closely  with  the  Small  Business  Administration  to  minimize  the  financial  and 
operational  impact  on  small  businesses  wherever  possible.  The  rule  includes 
provisions that allow MTSA-regulated passenger vessels (excluding cruise ships) 
to  establish  employee  access  areas  for  crewmembers  that  do  not  require 
unescorted access to secure areas such as the pilot house and engine room. This 
provision reduces the impact on those employees who rarely need to use spaces 
beyond those designated for support of passengers while maintaining the integ-
rity  of  vessels’  secure  areas.  We  are  also  producing  and  distributing  a  Small 
Business  Compliance  Guide  to  assist  small  businesses  in  their  implementation 
of the program. 
• When  practicable,  preserve  state  regulatory  flexibility.  Mariner  regulations  and 
port  security  plans  preempt  state  regulations.  However,  TSA  does  not  preempt 
states  from  requiring  background  checks  and  badging  systems  in  addition  to 
TWIC. States may need to set standards for important purposes other than ter-
rorism threats, such as preventing drug trafficking or organized crime. 
• Plan for privacy. All data collected at an enrollment center will be deleted from 
the enrollment center work stations. The entire enrollment record (including all 
fingerprints  collected)  is  stored  in  the  TSA  system,  which  is  protected  through 
role-based entry, encryption, and segmentation to prevent unauthorized use. 
• Technical innovation requires adaptive contract management. TWIC is attempt-
ing  to  develop  a  21st  century  technology  that  accommodates  evolving  IT  stand-
ards suited to emergent needs that span local, international, public, and private 
interests. This requires continual reevaluation of the scope and methods of con-
tracting. The recent Lockheed Martin contract award is a culmination of our ef-
forts to date. Due to the nature of this task, however, we will need to continue 
to  look  for  and  implement  adaptive  planning,  metrics,  and  changes  to  ensure 
this effort stays on track. 
• Don’t  expect  a  ‘‘silver  bullet’’  technology  solution.  Evolving  technology,  such  as 
card  readers,  creates  a  changing  environment  and  program  control  constraints. 
This is especially the case when the technology must be deployed to a vast mul-
titude of entities with remote connectivity challenges (e.g., vessels) and varying 
degrees of access control system capabilities. 
• Place  the  highest  value  in  stakeholder  input;  it  is  time  well  spent.  The  public 
hearings,  comments  to  the  NPRM,  meetings  with  operators  and  associations, 
and contributions of advisory councils all added pure value. We came away from 
each  and  every  one  of  these  efforts  better  informed  about  the  challenges,  the 
unacceptable impacts, and the practicable options for protecting our ports. 

Conclusion 

The  steps  we  are  taking  will  be  an  extremely  important  aspect  to  the  security  of 
our port facilities and vessels. It’s an effort which, when completed, will assure our 
citizens  that  those  people  who  have  unescorted  access  to  secure  areas  of  these  port

facilities  and  vessels  have  been  screened  to  make  sure  that  they  are  not  a  security 
threat. 

I  appreciate  the  keen  interest  that  this  Committee  has  in  an  effective  implemen-
tation of TWIC, and I thank you for your support. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my 
testimony and I am pleased to answer any questions that you may have. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, sir. 
And now I’ll recognize Admiral Salerno. 

STATEMENT OF BRIAN SALERNO, REAR ADMIRAL AND 

DIRECTOR OF INSPECTIONS AND COMPLIANCE, USCG, DHS 
Admiral SALERNO. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of 
the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  speak  with  you 
about  the  current  status,  and  the  way  ahead  for  the  TWIC  Pro-
gram. 

I  would  specifically  like  to  update  the  Committee  on  the  Coast 
Guard’s efforts, working in partnership with TSA to implement this 
program, which will strengthen maritime security, while balancing 
the  need  to  facilitate  commerce,  and  minimize  negative  effects  on 
our port and vessel stakeholders. 

Although  the  TWIC  Program  has  not  moved  as  rapidly  as  all  of 
us would like, important milestones have been accomplished. Work-
ing  relationships  have  been  strengthened  with  the  public  and  key 
industry stakeholders, and our commitment to protecting the mari-
time  transportation  system,  while  facilitating  commerce,  has  not 
wavered. 

Since publication of the final rule on January 25 of this year, the 
Coast  Guard  and  TSA  have  continued  to  meet  with  our  stake-
holders  in  various  venues.  We’ve  received  considerable  input  on 
their ongoing concerns. These venues include the Passenger Vessel 
Association  Conference,  SMART  card,  and  biometric  industry  con-
ferences,  maritime  union  meetings,  and  National  Petro-Chemical 
Refiner’s  Association  meeting,  an  American  Waterways  Operator’s 
Executive  Committee  meeting,  and  the  American  Association  of 
Port Authorities Conference, to name just a few. 

The concerns expressed in these meetings have included the roll- 
out process for the initial TWIC cards, and the need to ensure that 
new  hire  provisions  contained  in  the  rules  function  as  intended, 
which  is  of  particular  interest  to  small  businesses.  And,  of  course, 
the  pilot  program,  which  will  pave  the  way  for  follow-on  rule-
making for the card readers. 

To  address  the  roll-out,  Coast  Guard  and  TSA  have  worked  to-
gether to develop supplemental documents, designed to assist those 
affected  by  the  regulations.  These  documents  include  a  Navigation 
and Vessel Inspection Circular, or NVIC, which is meant to explain 
the  processes  and  procedures  related  to  the  implementation  of  the 
TWIC. 

We  have  solicited  and  received  input  from  the  affected  industry, 
as  well  as  from  Coast  Guard  field  personnel  on  the  draft  of  this 
NVIC,  and  have  had  generally  positive  feedback  on  the  guidance 
contained within it. 

We have also assisted in the development of two Small Business 
Administration  compliance  guides,  and  we  have  developed  flyers, 
working  with  the  contractor,  Lockheed  Martin,  which  will  provide 
information to TWIC applicants.

We are also developing internal guidance documents for training, 
implementation  and  consistent  enforcement.  These  documents  will 
be  cleared  through  Coast  Guard  Headquarters,  and  will  be  re-
viewed both by DHS and OMB, prior to distribution. 

As  we  move  into  the  implementation  phase,  we  will  continue 
working with industry to bring about the smooth transition to this 
much-needed  security  measure.  We  remain  mindful  of  industry’s 
concerns that vital provisions, such as the new-hire provision, func-
tion as intended, and our draft guidance reflects those concerns. 

We also plan to verify that the security enhancement envisioned 
by  the  TWIC  Program  is  having  the  intended  effect.  To  this  end, 
we  intend  to  procure  hand-held  readers  for  use  during  our  vessel 
and facility examinations and spot-checks. 

After  the  compliance  state  is  reached  in  a  given  port,  the  Coast 
Guard  will  use  portable  card  readers  to  randomly  check  the  valid-
ity of an individual’s TWIC. This will serve as an interim measure, 
until  the  second  rulemaking  on  card  readers  is  finalized  and  put 
into effect. 

Meanwhile,  we  are  working  very  closely  with  DHS  and  TSA  in 
coordinating the pilot program, which will provide key information 
and practical lessons learned to inform the second rulemaking. We 
requested, and received, recommendations from the National Mari-
time Security Advisory Committee, NMSAC, on technical specifica-
tions  to  be  considered  for  card  readers,  which  will  be  the  subject 
of  the  second  rulemaking.  NMSAC’s  recommendations  were  also 
published  in  the  Federal  Register  for  public  comment,  and  we  are 
considering  those  comments  carefully,  to  balance  privacy,  security 
and  commerce,  as  we  move  forward  with  the  card  reader  require-
ments. 

TSA and Coast Guard continue to reach out to our private sector 
stakeholders,  in  the  interest  of  fashioning  regulations  that  will 
strengthen  America’s  maritime  security,  while  advancing  com-
merce.  While  a  TWIC  Program  is  multi-faceted  and  includes  nu-
merous players, we are committed to developing a useful and valu-
able system. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  to  you  today,  and  I  will 

be happy to take your questions. 

[The prepared statement of Rear Admiral Salerno follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BRIAN SALERNO, REAR ADMIRAL AND DIRECTOR OF 

INSPECTIONS AND COMPLIANCE, USCG, DHS 

Good morning, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and members of the Committee. 
Thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about the current status and the 
way ahead for the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. 
Specifically,  I  would  like  to  update  the  Committee  on  the  Coast  Guard’s  efforts,  in 
partnership  with  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA),  to  implement 
a program that will strengthen maritime security while balancing the need to facili-
tate  commerce  and  minimize  negative  impacts  to  our  port  and  vessel  stakeholders. 
Background and Authority 

As a result of the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA), the Coast Guard 
developed  regulations  establishing  security  requirements  for  maritime  vessels  and 
facilities  posing  a  high  risk  of  being  involved  in  a  transportation  security  incident. 
As  part  of  these  regulations,  these  vessels  and  facilities  were  required  to  conduct 
detailed security assessments and in turn, develop security plans under which own-
ers  and  operators  have  been  required  to  operate  since  July  1,  2004.  The  Coast 
Guard has been responsible for implementing and ensuring compliance with MTSA.

This  same  law  requires  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  to  issue  a 
biometric  transportation  security  card  in  order  to  be  granted  unescorted  access  to 
secure  areas  of  vessels  and  facilities  to  those  individuals  who  satisfactorily  pass  a 
security threat assessment. TSA was assigned this requirement, and because of our 
overlapping  responsibilities,  the  Coast  Guard  and  TSA  formally  joined  efforts  to 
carry out the TWIC program in November 2004. In this partnership, TSA is respon-
sible  for  TWIC  enrollment,  security  threat  assessment  and  adjudication,  card  pro-
duction, TWIC issuance, conduct of the TWIC appeal and waiver process, and man-
agement  of  government  support  systems.  The  Coast  Guard  is  responsible  for  estab-
lishing and enforcing TWIC access control requirements at regulated vessels and fa-
cilities.  Both  agencies  work  very  closely  every  day  to  make  sure  that  our  efforts 
achieve the objective of increased security that MTSA intended. 

The  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  published  a  joint  TWIC  Notice  of  Proposed  Rule 
Making  (NPRM)  on  May  22,  2006.  Following  the  publication  of  the  NPRM  and  the 
subsequent  comment  period,  Congress  enacted  the  Security  and  Accountability  for 
Every  (SAFE)  Port  Act  of  2006.  The  SAFE  Port  Act  placed  new  statutory  require-
ments for the TWIC Program. Among these requirements were: the commencement 
of  a  pilot  program  to  test  the  viability  of  TWIC  cards  and  readers  in  the  maritime 
environment; deployment of the program in priority ports by set deadlines; inclusion 
of  a  provision  to  allow  newly  hired  employees  to  work  while  the  TWIC  application 
was being processed; and concurrent processing of the TWIC and merchant mariner 
applications. 

TSA and the Coast Guard published the TWIC final rule on January 25, 2007 in 
which the Coast Guard’s MTSA regulations and TSA’s Hazardous Material Endorse-
ment  regulations  were  amended  to  incorporate  the  TWIC  requirements.  This  final 
rule did not require the installation of card readers at vessels and facilities as origi-
nally proposed in the NPRM. This requirement will be proposed during a second no-
tice and comment rulemaking. 
Joint Rulemaking by TSA and the USCG 

In the TWIC Program, TSA is responsible for TWIC enrollment and issuance, in-
cluding  hardware  and  software  applications  and  the  data  storage  system.  This  re-
sponsibility  involves  conducting  a  security  threat  assessment  on  TWIC  applicants, 
which  includes  a  check  against  terrorist  watch  lists,  an  immigration  status  check, 
and a fingerprint-based criminal history records check, as well as perpetual vetting 
against  the  terrorist  watch  lists  throughout  the  5  year  life  of  the  TWIC.  The  Coast 
Guard  is  responsible  for  implementing  TWIC  in  the  maritime  environment.  The 
Coast  Guard  is  achieving  this  by  requiring  a  TWIC  for  all  individuals  who  need 
unescorted  access  to  secure  areas  of  MTSA-regulated  facilities  and  vessels  and  re-
quiring a TWIC for all U.S. merchant mariners with active credentials. 

TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  are  also  working  together  to  develop  several  supple-
mentary  documents  to  help  those  affected  by  this  regulation.  These  documents  in-
clude  a  Navigation  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular  (NVIC);  two  Small  Business  Ad-
ministration  Compliance  Guides;  fliers  for  TWIC  applicants;  and  internal  guidance 
documents for training, implementation, and enforcement for Coast Guard and TSA 
personnel. Since publication of the Final Rule, the Coast Guard and TSA have con-
ducted  outreach  at  national  venues  such  as  the  Passenger  Vessel  Association  Con-
ference; SMART card and biometric industry conferences; maritime union meetings; 
American Waterway Operators Executive Committee meeting; and the American As-
sociation of Port Authorities Conference to name a few. 
Public Comments and Concerns 

TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  received  almost  2,000  comments  on  the  TWIC  NPRM. 
A general theme throughout the comments was the technological and economic fea-
sibility  of  the  TWIC  cards  and  card  readers  in  the  maritime  environment.  While 
smart  cards,  open  slot  card  readers,  and  the  use  of  biometrics  have  been  used  for 
a  number  of  years  in  controlled,  office-like  environments,  very  few  studies  have  ex-
amined how currently approved biometric card readers will withstand the compara-
tively  harsh  environments  of  vessels  and  maritime  facilities.  Also,  several  com-
menters  stated  that  the  cost  of  biometric  card  readers  would  be  extremely  detri-
mental  for  small  entities.  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  found  the  comments  received 
to be invaluable in determining the best way forward for this rule. 

Throughout February and March of this year, the Coast Guard also solicited com-
ments  from  field  units  and  industry  stakeholders  while  drafting  the  TWIC  Naviga-
tion  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular.  We  received  over  400  comments,  which  were 
used  to  construct  a  clear  and  thorough  guidance  document  for  industry  and  Coast 
Guard units during implementation. This guidance document is currently in concur-

rent clearance at Coast Guard Headquarters and will be reviewed by both DHS and 
OMB prior to distribution. 
Pilot Program 

Based on the comments received from all sources, the Department chose to bifur-
cate  the  rule.  In  order  to  address  concerns  about  the  adequacy  of  current  reader 
technology,  the  Coast  Guard  is  not  requiring  facility  and  vessel  owner  operators  to 
purchase,  install,  and  maintain  card  readers.  We  will  address  this  requirement  in 
a  separate  rulemaking  following  the  pilot  program  required  by  the  SAFE  Port  Act 
and  will  provide  all  interested  parties  ample  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  new 
proposals during the comment period following the second NPRM. 

In  addition,  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee  (NMSAC) 
formed  a  working  group  of  maritime  industry  and  biometric  technology  representa-
tives  to  propose  specifications  for  TWIC  cards  and  card  readers  using  a  contactless 
(or  proximity)  interface.  The  specifications  were  presented  and  approved  on  Feb-
ruary  28,  2007  at  NMSAC’s  quarterly  meeting.  A  notice  of  availability  of  the  speci-
fications  was  published  in  the  Federal  Register  for  public  comment  on  March  16, 
2007. NMSAC’s specifications will inform the pilot program set to begin in the Ports 
of Los Angeles/Long Beach, CA, in June 2007. 
The Way Ahead 

Work  continues  on  several  aspects  of  the  TWIC  Program.  The  Coast  Guard  is  in 
the  process  of  procuring  handheld  open  slot  card  readers  for  use  during  vessel  and 
facility  inspections  and  spot  checks.  The  Coast  Guard  will  use  the  card  readers  to 
randomly  check  the  validity  of  an  individual’s  TWIC.  Also,  the  provision  for  newly 
hired employees to work while they await issuance of a TWIC is in development and 
on track between the Coast Guard’s Homeport web-portal engineers and TSA’s Iden-
tity  Data  Management  System  engineers.  Internally,  policy  is  being  written  for  im-
plementation and enforcement of the TWIC Program in our ports through collabora-
tion  of  our  law  enforcement,  port  security,  and  technology  experts.  We  are  working 
to meet the deadlines set by the SAFE Port Act. 
Conclusion 

TSA  and  the  USCG  continue  to  reach  out  to  our  private  sector  stakeholders  in 
the interest of fashioning a regulation that strengthens America’s maritime security 
while  advancing  commerce.  While  the  TWIC  Program  is  multifaceted  and  includes 
numerous  players,  we  are  committed  to  developing  a  useful  and  valuable  system. 
I would be happy to take any questions you have at this time. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Admiral. 
May I now call upon Mr. Rabkin? 

STATEMENT OF NORMAN J. RABKIN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, 

HOMELAND SECURITY AND JUSTICE ISSUES, GAO 

Mr.  RABKIN.  Chairman  Inouye,  members  of  the  Committee, 
thank  you  very  much  for  inviting  me  this  morning  to  participate 
in this hearing on the status of the TWIC Program. 

In December 2004, and September 2006, we reported on the sta-
tus of the development and testing of the program. Our 2004 report 
identified  challenges  that  TSA  faced  in  developing  regulations  and 
a  comprehensive  plan  for  managing  the  TWIC  Program,  and  sev-
eral  factors  that  caused  TSA  to  miss  the  initial  deadlines  for 
issuing TWIC cards. 

Our 2006 report identified the challenges encountered during the 
TWIC program testing, and several problems related to TWIC con-
tract planning and oversight. 

My  testimony  today  focuses  on  two  key  areas,  first,  the  progress 
that  TSA  has  made  since  September,  and  second,  some  of  the  re-
maining  challenges  that  TSA,  the  Coast  Guard  and  the  maritime 
industry must overcome to ensure the successful implementation of 
the TWIC Program.

17 

TSA  has  made  progress  towards  implementing  TWIC  and  ad-
dressing several of the problems that we have previously identified 
regarding contract oversight, planning and coordination with stake-
holders.  Specifically,  TSA  has  first  issued  the  rule  about  enrolling 
workers  and  issuing  the  cards  to  workers  in  the  maritime  sector. 
Second,  it  has  awarded  a  $70  million  contract  for  enrolling  these 
workers in the TWIC program. Third, it has assured us that it has 
a schedule for enrolling these workers and issuing the TWIC cards 
at ports, and conducting the pilot program to test TWIC access con-
trol technologies. Fourth, it has added staff with program and con-
tract  management  expertise  to  help  oversee  the  TWIC  enrollment 
contract. And, finally, it has improved communications in coordina-
tion  with  the  maritime  stakeholders,  and  has  plans  for  conducting 
public outreach and education efforts. 

Nevertheless,  TSA  and  the  maritime  industry  stakeholders  still 
face several challenges to ensuring that the TWIC Program can be 
implemented successfully. First, TSA and its enrollment contractor 
need  to  transition  from  limited  testing  of  the  TWIC  Program,  to 
successful  implementation  of  the  program  on  a  much  larger  scale, 
covering  over  770,000  workers  at  over  3,000–3,500  maritime  facili-
ties and over 5,000 vessels. 

During  testing,  TSA  issued  TWIC  cards  to  only  about  1,700 
workers, far short of its goal at that time of 75,000. Although TSA 
has  learned  from  the  testing  experience,  and  has  taken  steps  to 
help  address  problems  that  we  previously  identified,  it  remains  to 
be seen whether TSA and the enrollment contractor will be able to 
implement the TWIC Program on such a large scale, in reasonable 
time-frames. 

Second, TSA and the enrollment contractor will also need to edu-
cate  workers  about  the  TWIC  requirements,  ensure  that  enroll-
ments  begin  in  a  timely  manner,  and  process  numerous  back-
ground  checks,  appeals  and  waivers.  Identifying  the  thousands  of 
workers located throughout this and neighboring countries who will 
need  to  have  the  TWIC  card,  and  educating  them  about  their  re-
sponsibilities  for  obtaining  the  card,  will  require  a  communication 
and coordination effort on the part of TSA and the enrollment con-
tractor.  Furthermore,  processing  these  appeals,  and  doing  so  in  a 
timely manner will also be a challenge. 

Finally,  TSA  and  the  stakeholders  must  also  ensure  that  the 
TWIC access control technologies will work effectively in the mari-
time  environment,  be  compatible  with  the  cards  that  have  been 
issued, and will balance security with the flow of commerce. Access 
control  technologies  will  need  to  withstand  the  harsh  rigors  of  the 
maritime environment. If biometric card readers do not work effec-
tively,  ports  could  experience  long  lines,  delaying  other  workers  or 
trucks from entering. Such delays, of course, will negatively impact 
maritime commerce, costing port facilities time and money. 

As  TSA  continues  to  implement  the  TWIC  Program,  we  believe 
it should establish reasonable time-frames for holding itself, and its 
contractor  accountable,  and  ensure  that  it  learns  and  implements 
lessons  as  it  phases  in  the  enrollment  function  and  pilot  tests  the 
access control technologies. 

Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement, and I also would be 

glad to answer your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Rabkin follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF NORMAN J. RABKIN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, 

HOMELAND SECURITY AND JUSTICE ISSUES, GAO 

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee: 
Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  participate  in  today’s  hearing  on  the  status  of  the 
Transportation  Security  Administration’s  (TSA)  Transportation  Worker  Identifica-
tion Credential (TWIC) program. Ensuring that only workers that do not pose a ter-
rorist threat are allowed access to secure areas of the Nation’s transportation facili-
ties is critical to helping prevent a terrorist attack. The TWIC program was created 
to  help  protect  these  facilities  from  the  threat  of  terrorism  by  issuing  identification 
cards  only  to  workers  who  do  not  pose  a  terrorist  threat  and  allow  these  workers 
unescorted  access  to  secure  areas  of  the  transportation  system.  To  accomplish  this 
objective, the TWIC program will include collection of personal and biometric infor-
mation to validate workers’ identities, background checks on transportation workers 
to ensure they do not pose a threat to security, issuance of tamper-resistant biomet-
ric  credentials  that  cannot  be  counterfeited,  verification  of  these  credentials  using 
biometric  access  control  systems  before  a  worker  is  granted  unescorted  access  to  a 
secure area, and revocation of credentials if disqualifying information is discovered, 
or  if  a  card  is  lost,  damaged,  or  stolen.  The  TWIC  program  was  initially  intended 
to  serve  all  modes  of  transportation;  however,  TSA,  in  partnership  with  the  Coast 
Guard, is focusing initial implementation on the maritime sector and is planning to 
implement the program in other modes in the future. 

In December 2004 and September 2006, we reported on the status of the develop-
ment  and  testing  of  the  TWIC  program.1 Our  2004  report  identified  the  challenges 
TSA  faced  in  developing  regulations  and  a  comprehensive  plan  for  managing  the 
TWIC  program  and  several  factors  that  caused  TSA  to  miss  initial  deadlines  for 
issuing  TWIC  cards.  Our  September  2006  report  identified  the  challenges  encoun-
tered during TWIC program testing and several problems related to TWIC contract 
planning and oversight. In August 2006, TSA decided that the TWIC program would 
be  implemented  in  the  maritime  sector  using  two  separate  rules.  TSA  issued  the 
first rule in January 2007 requiring worker enrollment and card issuance and plans 
to issue a proposed rule on access control technologies in 2008. Since our September 
2006 report, the Congress passed the Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) 
Port  Act  of  2006,  directing  TSA,  among  other  things,  to  implement  the  TWIC  pro-
gram at the 10 highest risk ports by July 1, 2007.2 In January 2007, TSA awarded 
a $70 million contract to begin enrolling workers and issuing TWIC cards to workers 
at these maritime facilities. 

My  testimony  today  focuses  on  two  key  areas:  (1)  the  progress  TSA  has  made 
since  September  2006  in  implementing  the  TWIC  program;  and  (2)  some  of  the  re-
maining  challenges  that  TSA  and  the  maritime  industry  must  overcome  to  ensure 
the  successful  implementation  of  the  TWIC  program.  My  comments  are  based  pri-
marily  on  our  December  2004  and  September  2006  reports  on  the  TWIC  program, 
which  reflect  work  conducted  at  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard,  as  well  as  site  visits  to 
transportation facilities that participated in testing the TWIC program. In addition, 
in  March  and  April  2007,  we  interviewed  TSA  officials  and  obtained  some  sup-
porting  documentation  regarding  the  agency’s  efforts  to  implement  the  TWIC  pro-
gram.  We  also  interviewed  officials  at  port  facilities  in  California,  Delaware,  and 
Florida  that  participated  in  TWIC  testing  concerning  the  implementation  of  the 
TWIC  program.  We  conducted  our  work  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  gov-
ernment auditing standards. 
Summary 

Since  we  issued  our  report  on  the  TWIC  program  in  September  2006,  TSA  has 
made  progress  toward  implementing  the  TWIC  program  and  addressing  several  of 
the  problems  that  we  previously  identified  regarding  contract  oversight  and  plan-
ning and coordination with stakeholders. Specifically, TSA has: 

• issued  a  TWIC  rule  that  sets  forth  the  requirements  for  enrolling  workers  and 
• awarded a $70 million contract for enrolling workers in the TWIC program, 

issuing TWIC cards to workers in the maritime sector;

• established  a  schedule  for  enrolling  workers  and  issuing  TWIC  cards  at  ports 

and conducting a pilot program to test TWIC access control technologies, 

• added  staff  with  program  and  contract  management  expertise  to  help  oversee 

the TWIC enrollment contract, and 

• developed  plans  to  improve  communication  and  coordination  with  maritime 
stakeholders,  including  plans  for  conducting  public  outreach  and  education  ef-
forts. 

TSA  and  maritime  industry  stakeholders  still  face  several  challenges  to  ensuring 

that the TWIC program can be implemented successfully: 

• TSA and its enrollment contractor need to transition from limited testing of the 
TWIC  program  to  successful  implementation  of  the  program  on  a  much  larger 
scale covering 770,000 workers at about 3,500 maritime facilities and 5,300 ves-
sels.3 

• TSA  and  its  enrollment  contractor  will  need  to  educate  workers  on  the  new 
TWIC  requirements,  ensure  that  enrollments  begin  in  a  timely  manner,  and 
process numerous background checks, appeals, and waivers. 

• TSA  and  industry  stakeholders  will  need  to  ensure  that  TWIC  access  control 
technologies  will  work  effectively  in  the  maritime  environment,  be  compatible 
with TWIC cards that will be issued, and balance security with the flow of mar-
itime commerce. 

As  TSA  works  to  implement  the  TWIC  program  and  begin  enrolling  workers,  it 
will  be  important  that  the  agency  establish  clear  and  reasonable  time-frames  and 
ensure  that  all  aspects  of  the  TWIC  program,  including  the  TWIC  access  control 
technologies, are fully tested in the maritime environment. 
Background 

Securing transportation systems and facilities is complicated, requiring balancing 
security to address potential threats while facilitating the flow of people and goods. 
These  systems  and  facilities  are  critical  components  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  are 
necessary  for  supplying  goods  throughout  the  country  and  supporting  international 
commerce.  U.S.  transportation  systems  and  facilities  move  over  30  million  tons  of 
freight  and  provide  approximately  1.1  billion  passenger  trips  each  day.  The  Ports 
of  Los  Angeles  and  Long  Beach  estimate  that  they  alone  handle  about  43  percent 
of the Nation’s oceangoing cargo. The importance of these systems and facilities also 
makes them attractive targets to terrorists. These systems and facilities are vulner-
able  and  difficult  to  secure  given  their  size,  easy  accessibility,  large  number  of  po-
tential  targets,  and  proximity  to  urban  areas.  A  terrorist  attack  at  these  systems 
and facilities could cause a tremendous loss of life and disruption to our society. An 
attack would also be costly. According to testimony by a Port of Los Angeles official, 
a  2002  labor  dispute  led  to  a  10-day  shutdown  of  West  Coast  port  operations,  cost-
ing  the  Nation’s  economy  an  estimated  $1.5  billion  per  day.4 A  terrorist  attack  to 
a port facility could have a similar or greater impact. 

One  potential  security  threat  stems  from  those  individuals  who  work  in  secure 
areas  of  the  Nation’s  transportation  system,  including  seaports,  airports,  railroad 
terminals,  mass  transit  stations,  and  other  transportation  facilities.  It  is  estimated 
that about 6 million workers, including longshoreman, mechanics, aviation and rail-
road  employees,  truck  drivers,  and  others  access  secure  areas  of  the  Nation’s  esti-
mated  4,000  transportation  facilities  each  day  while  performing  their  jobs.  Some  of 
these  workers,  such  as  truck  drivers,  regularly  access  secure  areas  at  multiple 
transportation  facilities.  Ensuring  that  only  workers  that  do  not  pose  a  terrorism 
security  risk  are  allowed  unescorted  access  to  secure  areas  is  important  in  helping 
to  prevent  an  attack.  According  to  TSA  and  transportation  industry  stakeholders, 
many  individuals  that  work  in  secure  areas  are  currently  not  required  to  undergo 
a  background  check  or  a  stringent  identification  process  in  order  to  access  secure 
areas.  In  addition,  without  a  standard  credential  that  is  recognized  across  modes 
of  transportation  and  facilities,  many  workers  must  obtain  multiple  credentials  to 
access each transportation facility they enter. 

3 TSA estimated the total number of workers, facilities, and vessels affected by the TWIC rule 

in the Regulatory Impact Assessment of the TWIC rule.

TWIC Program History 

20 

In  the  aftermath  of  the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks,  the  Aviation  and 
Transportation  Security  Act  (ATSA)  was  enacted  in  November  2001.5 Among  other 
things, ATSA required TSA to work with airport operators to strengthen access con-
trol  points  in  secure  areas  and  consider  using  biometric  access  control  systems  to 
verify  the  identity  of  individuals  who  seek  to  enter  a  secure  airport  area.  In  re-
sponse to ATSA, TSA established the TWIC program in December 2001 to mitigate 
the threat of terrorists and other unauthorized persons from accessing secure areas 
of the entire transportation network, by creating a common identification credential 
that  could  be  used  by  workers  in  all  modes  of  transportation.6 In  November  2002, 
the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) was enacted and required 
the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  to  issue  a  maritime  worker  identification  card 
that  uses  biometrics,  such  as  fingerprints,  to  control  access  to  secure  areas  of  sea-
ports and vessels, among other things.7 

The responsibility for securing the Nation’s transportation system and facilities is 
shared  by  Federal,  state,  and  local  governments,  as  well  as  the  private  sector.  At 
the  Federal  Government  level,  TSA,  the  agency  responsible  for  the  security  of  all 
modes of transportation, has taken the lead in developing the TWIC program, while 
the Coast Guard is responsible for developing maritime security regulations and en-
suring that maritime facilities and vessels are in compliance with these regulations. 
As  a  result,  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  are  working  together  to  implement  TWIC 
in  the  maritime  sector.  Most  seaports,  airports,  mass  transit  stations,  and  other 
transportation  systems  and  facilities  in  the  United  States  are  owned  and  operated 
by  state  and  local  government  authorities  and  private  companies.  As  a  result,  cer-
tain  components  of  the  TWIC  program,  such  as  installing  card  readers,  will  be  the 
responsibility  of  these  state  and  local  governments  and  private  industry  stake-
holders. 

TSA—through  a  private  contractor—tested  the  TWIC  program  from  August  2004 
to June 2005 at 28 transportation facilities around the Nation, including 22 port fa-
cilities, 2 airports, 1 rail facility, 1 maritime exchange, 1 truck stop, and a U.S. post-
al  service  facility.  In  August  2005,  TSA  and  the  testing  contractor  completed  a  re-
port  summarizing  the  results  of  the  TWIC  testing.  TSA  also  hired  an  independent 
contractor  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  TWIC  testing  contractor.  Specifically, 
the  independent  contractor  conducted  its  assessment  from  March  2005  to  January 
2006,  and  evaluated  whether  the  testing  contractor  met  the  requirements  of  the 
testing  contract.  The  independent  contractor  issued  its  final  report  on  January  25, 
2006. 

Since  its  creation,  the  TWIC  program  has  received  about  $79  million  in  funding 

for program development. (See Table 1.)

Key Components of the TWIC Program 

The TWIC program is designed to enhance security using several key components 

(see Fig. 1). These include: 

5 Pub. L. 107–71, 115 Stat. 597 (2001). 
6 TSA was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland 
Security pursuant to requirements in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107–296, 116 
Stat. 2135 (2002). 

7 Pub. L. 107–295, 116 Stat. 2064 (2002).

• Enrollment:  Transportation  workers  will  be  enrolled  in  the  TWIC  program  at 
enrollment  centers  by  providing  personal  information,  such  as  a  social  security 
number and address, and be photographed and fingerprinted. For those workers 
who  are  unable  to  provide  quality  fingerprints,  TSA  is  to  collect  an  alternate 
authentication identifier. 

• Background checks: TSA will conduct background checks on each worker to en-
sure  that  individuals  do  not  pose  a  security  threat.  These  will  include  several 
components.  First,  TSA  will  conduct  a  security  threat  assessment  that  may  in-
clude,  for  example,  terrorism  databases  or  terrorism  watch  lists,  such  as  TSA’s 
No-fly and selectee lists. Second, a Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal his-
tory  records  check  will  be  conducted  to  identify  if  the  worker  has  any  disquali-
fying criminal offenses. Third, workers’ immigration status and mental capacity 
will  be  checked.  Workers  will  have  the  opportunity  to  appeal  the  results  of  the 
threat assessment or request a waiver in certain limited circumstances. 

• TWIC  card  production:  After  TSA  determines  that  a  worker  has  passed  the 
background  check,  the  worker’s  information  is  provided  to  a  Federal  card  pro-
duction facility where the TWIC card will be personalized for the worker, manu-
factured, and then sent back to the enrollment center. 

• Card  issuance:  Transportation  workers  will  be  informed  when  their  cards  are 
ready to be picked up at enrollment centers. Once a card has been issued, work-
ers  will  present  their  TWIC  cards  to  security  officials  when  they  seek  to  enter 
a  secure  area  and  in  the  future  will  enter  secure  areas  through  biometric  card 
readers.

TSA  Has  Made  Progress  Since  September  2006  in  Implementing  the  TWIC 

Program 

Since  we  issued  our  report  on  the  TWIC  program  in  September  2006,  TSA  has 
made  progress  toward  implementing  the  TWIC  program  and  addressing  several  of 
the  problems  that  we  previously  identified  regarding  contract  oversight  and  plan-
ning  and  coordination  with  stakeholders.  In  January  2007,  TSA  and  the  Coast 
Guard  issued  a  TWIC  rule  that  sets  forth  the  requirements  for  enrolling  workers 
and issuing TWIC cards to workers in the maritime sector and awarded a $70 mil-
lion  contract  for  enrolling  workers  in  the  TWIC  program.  TSA  is  also  taking  steps 
designed  to  address  requirements  in  the  SAFE  Port  Act  regarding  the  TWIC  pro-
gram,  such  as  establishing  a  rollout  schedule  for  enrolling  workers  and  issuing 
TWIC  cards  at  ports  and  conducting  a  pilot  program  to  test  TWIC  access  control 
technologies.  TSA  has  also  taken  steps  to  strengthen  TWIC  contract  planning  and 
oversight  and  improve  communication  and  coordination  with  its  maritime  stake-
holders.  Since  September  2006,  TSA  reported  that  it  has  added  staff  with  program 
and  contract  management  expertise  to  help  oversee  the  TWIC  enrollment  contract 
and  taken  additional  steps  to  help  ensure  that  contract  requirements  are  met.  In 
addition,  TSA  has  also  focused  on  improving  communication  and  coordination  with 
maritime stakeholders, such as developing plans for conducting public outreach and 
education efforts. 
TSA Issued a TWIC Rule and Awarded a Contract To Begin Enrolling Workers and 

Issuing TWIC Cards This Year 

On January 25, 2007, TSA and the Coast Guard issued a rule that sets forth the 
regulatory  requirements  for  enrolling  workers  and  issuing  TWIC  cards  to  workers 
in  the  maritime  sector.  Specifically,  the  TWIC  rule  provides  that  workers  and  mer-
chant  mariners  requiring  unescorted  access  to  secure  areas  of  maritime  facilities 
and vessels must enroll in the TWIC program, undergo a background check, and ob-
tain a TWIC card before such access is granted. In addition, the rule requires own-
ers  and  operators  of  maritime  facilities  and  vessels  to  change  their  existing  access 
control procedures to ensure that merchant mariners and any other individual seek-
ing  unescorted  access  to  a  secure  area  of  a  facility  or  vessel  has  a  TWIC.  Table  2 
describes the specific requirements in the TWIC rule.

Background checks 

Individuals who require unescorted access to secure areas of maritime 
facilities  and  vessels  and  all  merchant  mariners  must  obtain  a 
TWIC card before such access is granted. 

All  workers  applying  for  a  TWIC  card  will  pay  a  fee  of  $137  to  cover 
the costs associated with the TWIC program. Workers that have al-
ready  undergone  a  Federal  threat  assessment  comparable  to  the 
one  required  to  obtain  a  TWIC  will  pay  a  reduced  fee  of  $105.  The 
interim replacement fee for a TWIC card will be $36. 

By  no  later  than  September  25,  2008,  facilities  and  vessels  currently 
regulated by the Maritime Transportation Security Act must change 
their  current  access  control  procedures  to  ensure  that  any  indi-
vidual  or  merchant  mariner  seeking  unescorted  access  to  a  secure 
area has a TWIC card. 

Newly  hired  workers,  who  have  applied  for,  but  have  not  received 
their TWIC card, will be allowed access to secure areas for 30 days 
as  long  as  they  meet  specified  criteria,  such  as  passing  a  TSA 
name-based  background  check,  and  only  while  accompanied  by  an-
other employee with a TWIC card. Individuals that need to enter a 
secure  area  but  do  not  have  a  TWIC  card  must  be  escorted  at  all 
times by individuals with a TWIC card. 

All  workers  applying  for  a  TWIC  card  must  provide  specific  types  of 
personal  information  and  fingerprints  to  TSA  to  conduct  a  security 
threat  assessment,  that  includes  an  FBI  fingerprint-based  criminal 
history records check, and an immigration status check. In order to 
receive  a  TWIC  card,  workers  must  not  have  been  incarcerated  or 
convicted  of  certain  crimes  within  prescribed  time  periods,  must 
have  legal  presence  or  authorization  to  work  in  the  United  States, 
have no connection to terrorist activity, and cannot have been found 
as  lacking  mental  capacity  or  have  been  committed  to  a  mental 
health facility.

Table 2.—Requirements in the TWIC Rule—Continued 

Description of requirement 

All TWIC applicants will have the opportunity to appeal a background 
check disqualification through TSA or apply to TSA for a waiver, ei-
ther  during  the  application  process,  or  after  being  disqualified  for 
certain  crimes,  mental  incapacity,  or  are  aliens  in  Temporary  Pro-
tected  Status.  Applicants  who  appeal  or  seek  a  waiver  and  are  de-
nied by TSA may seek review by an administrative law judge. 

The  Coast  Guard  will  conduct  unannounced  checks  to  confirm  the 
identity of TWIC card holders using hand-held biometric card read-
ers to check the biometric on the TWIC card against the person pre-
senting the card. In addition, security personnel will conduct visual 
inspections  of  the  TWIC  cards  and  look  for  signs  of  tampering  or 
forgery when a worker enters a secure area. 

Source: GAO analysis of TWIC rule. 
The  TWIC  rule  does  not  include  the  requirements  for  owners  and  operators  of 
maritime  facilities  and  vessels  to  purchase  and  install  TWIC  access  control  tech-
nologies, such as biometric TWIC card readers. As a result, the TWIC card will ini-
tially serve as a visual identity badge until access control technologies are required 
to verify the credentials when a worker enters a secure area. According to TSA, dur-
ing  the  program’s  initial  implementation,  workers  will  present  their  TWIC  cards  to 
authorized  security  personnel,  who  will  compare  the  cardholder  to  his  or  her  photo 
and inspect the card for signs of tampering. In addition, the Coast Guard will verify 
TWIC cards when conducting vessel and facility inspections and during spot checks 
using hand-held biometric card readers to ensure that credentials are valid. Accord-
ing to TSA, the requirements for TWIC access control technologies will be set forth 
in a second proposed rule to be issued in 2008, at which time TSA will solicit public 
comments and hold public meetings. 

As  part  of  the  TWIC  rule,  TSA  is  also  taking  steps  designed  to  address  various 
requirements  of  the  SAFE  Port  Act  including  that  it  implement  TWIC  at  the  10 
highest  risk  ports  by  July  1,  2007.  According  to  TSA,  the  agency  has  categorized 
ports  based  on  risk  and  has  developed  a  schedule  for  implementing  TWIC  at  these 
ports  to  address  the  deadlines  in  the  SAFE  Port  Act.  In  addition,  TSA  is  currently 
planning  to  conduct  a  pilot  program  at  five  maritime  locations  to  test  TWIC  access 
control  technologies,  such  as  biometric  card  readers,  in  the  maritime  environment. 
According to TSA, the agency is partnering with the Ports of Los Angeles and Long 
Beach  to  test  TWIC  access  control  technologies  and  plans  to  select  additional  ports 
to  participate  in  the  pilot  in  the  near  future.  TSA  and  Port  of  Los  Angeles  officials 
told  us  that  ports  participating  in  the  pilot  will  be  responsible  for  paying  for  the 
costs of the pilot and plan to use Federal port security grant funds for this purpose. 
According  to  TSA,  the  agency  plans  to  begin  the  pilot  in  conjunction  with  the 
issuance  of  TWIC  cards  so  the  access  control  technologies  can  be  tested  with  the 
cards  that  are  issued  to  workers.  Once  the  pilot  has  been  completed,  TSA  plans  to 
use the results in developing its proposed rule on TWIC access control technologies. 
Following  the  issuance  of  the  TWIC  rule  in  January  2007,  TSA  awarded  a  $70 
million  contract  to  a  private  company  to  enroll  the  estimated  770,000  workers  re-
quired to obtain a TWIC card. According to TSA officials, the contract costs include 
$14  million  for  the  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  TWIC  identity  management 
system  that  contains  information  on  workers  enrolled  in  the  TWIC  program,  $53 
million for the cost of enrolling workers, and $3 million designated to award the en-
rollment  contractor  in  the  event  of  excellent  performance.  TSA  officials  stated  that 
they are currently transitioning the TWIC systems to the enrollment contractor and 
testing these systems to ensure that they will function effectively during nationwide 
implementation. TSA originally planned to begin enrolling workers at the first port 
by March 26, 2007—the effective date of the TWIC rule. However, according to TSA 
officials,  initial  enrollments  have  been  delayed.  While  TSA  officials  did  not  provide 
specific  reasons  for  the  delay,  officials  from  the  port  where  enrollments  were  to 
begin  told  us  that  software  problems  were  the  cause  of  the  delay,  and  could  post-
pone  the  first  enrollments  until  May  2007.  In  addition,  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard 
have  not  set  a  date  by  which  workers  will  be  required  to  posses  a  TWIC  card  to 
access  secure  areas  of  maritime  facilities  and  vessels.  According  to  the  TWIC  rule, 
once the agency determines at which ports TWIC will be implemented and by what 
date, this schedule will be posted to the Federal Register.

TSA  Has  Taken  Steps  to  Strengthen  Contract  Planning  and  Oversight  and  Better 

Coordinate With Maritime Industry Stakeholders 

24 

Since we issued our September 2006 report, TSA has taken several steps designed 
to strengthen contract planning and oversight. We previously reported that TSA ex-
perienced  problems  in  planning  for  and  overseeing  the  contract  to  test  the  TWIC 
program, which contributed to a doubling of TWIC testing contract costs and a fail-
ure  to  test  all  key  components  of  the  TWIC  program.  We  recommended  that  TSA 
strengthen contract planning and oversight before awarding a contract to implement 
the  TWIC  program.  TSA  acknowledged  these  problems  and  has  taken  steps  to  ad-
dress  our  recommendations.  Specifically,  TSA  has  taken  the  following  steps  de-
signed to strengthen contract planning and oversight: 

and performance. 

gram management to the TWIC program office. 

• Added  staff  with  expertise  in  technology,  acquisitions,  and  contract  and  pro-
• Established a TWIC program control office to help oversee contract deliverables 
• Established  monthly  performance  management  reviews  and  periodic  site  visits 
to  TWIC  enrollment  centers  to  verify  performance  data  reported  by  the  con-
tractor. 
• Required  the  enrollment  contractor  to  survey  customer  satisfaction  as  part  of 

contract performance. 

In addition to these steps, TSA has established a TWIC quality assurance surveil-
lance  plan  that  is  designed  to  allow  TSA  to  track  the  enrollment  contractor’s  per-
formance in comparison to acceptable quality levels. This plan is designed to provide 
financial incentives for exceeding these quality levels and disincentives, or penalties, 
if  they  are  not  met.  According  to  the  plan,  the  contractor’s  performance  will  be 
measured  against  established  milestones  and  performance  metrics  that  the  con-
tractor  must  meet  for  customer  satisfaction,  enrollment  time,  number  of  failures  to 
enroll,  and  TWIC  help  desk  response  times,  among  others.  TSA  plans  to  monitor 
the contractor’s performance through monthly performance reviews and by verifying 
information on performance metrics provided by the contractor. 

In addition to contract planning and oversight, TSA has also taken steps designed 
to  address  problems  that  were  identified  in  our  September  2006  report  regarding 
communication  and  coordination  with  maritime  stakeholders.  We  previously  re-
ported that stakeholders at all 15 TWIC testing locations that we visited cited poor 
communication  and  coordination  by  TSA  during  testing  of  the  TWIC  program.  For 
example,  TSA  never  provided  the  final  results  or  report  on  TWIC  testing  to  stake-
holders that participated in the test, and some stakeholders stated that communica-
tion  from  TSA  would  stop  for  months  at  a  time  during  testing.  We  recommended 
that  TSA  closely  coordinate  with  maritime  industry  stakeholders  and  establish  a 
communication and coordination plan to capture and address the concerns of stake-
holders  during  implementation.  TSA  acknowledged  that  the  agency  could  have  bet-
ter  communicated  with  stakeholders  at  TWIC  testing  locations  and  has  reported 
taking several steps to strengthen communication and coordination since September 
2006. For example, TSA officials told us that the agency developed a TWIC commu-
nication strategy and plan that describes how the agency will communicate with the 
owners  and  operators  of  maritime  facilities  and  vessels,  TWIC  applicants,  unions, 
industry  associations,  Coast  Guard  Captains  of  the  Port,  and  other  interested  par-
ties.  In  addition,  TSA  required  that  the  enrollment  contractor  establish  a  plan  for 
communicating with stakeholders. 

TSA, the Coast Guard, and the enrollment contractor have taken additional steps 
designed  to  ensure  close  coordination  and  communication  with  the  maritime  indus-
try. These steps include: 

Security Advisory Committee to communicate with local stakeholders. 

• Posting frequently asked questions on the TSA and Coast Guard websites. 
• Participating in maritime stakeholder conferences and briefings. 
• Working  with  Coast  Guard  Captains  of  the  Ports  and  the  National  Maritime 
• Conducting  outreach  with  maritime  facility  operators  and  port  authorities,  in-
• Creating  a  TWIC  stakeholder  communication  committee  chaired  by  TSA,  the 
Coast  Guard,  and  enrollment  contractor,  with  members  from  15  maritime  in-
dustry  stakeholder  groups.  According  to  TSA,  this  committee  will  meet  twice 
per month during the TWIC implementation. 

cluding informational bulletins and fliers. 

Several stakeholders we recently spoke to confirmed that TSA and its enrollment 
contractor have placed a greater emphasis on communicating and coordinating with

stakeholders  during  implementation  and  on  correcting  past  problems.  For  example, 
an  official  from  the  port  where  TWIC  will  first  be  implemented  stated  that,  thus 
far,  communication,  coordination,  and  outreach  by  TSA  and  its  enrollment  con-
tractor  have  been  excellent,  and  far  better  than  during  TWIC  testing.  In  addition, 
the  TWIC  enrollment  contractor  has  hired  a  separate  subcontractor  to  conduct  a 
public outreach campaign to inform and educate the maritime industry and individ-
uals  that  will  be  required  to  obtain  a  TWIC  card  about  the  program.  For  example, 
the port official stated that the subcontractor is developing a list of trucking compa-
nies  that  deliver  to  the  port,  so  information  on  the  TWIC  enrollment  requirements 
can be mailed to truck drivers. 
TSA and Industry Stakeholders Need To Address Challenges To Ensure the 

TWIC Program Is Implemented Successfully 

TSA and maritime industry stakeholders need to address several challenges to en-
sure  that  the  TWIC  program  can  be  implemented  successfully.  As  we  reported  in 
September  2006,  TSA  and  its  enrollment  contractor  face  the  challenge  of 
transitioning  from  limited  testing  of  the  TWIC  program  to  successful  implementa-
tion of the program on a much larger scale covering 770,000 workers at about 3,500 
maritime  facilities  and  5,300  vessels.  Maritime  stakeholders  we  spoke  to  identified 
additional challenges to implementing the TWIC program that warrant attention by 
TSA  and  its  enrollment  contractor,  including  educating  workers  on  the  new  TWIC 
requirements,  ensuring  that  enrollments  begin  in  a  timely  manner,  and  processing 
numerous  background  checks,  appeals,  and  waiver  applications.  Furthermore,  TSA 
and  industry  stakeholders  also  face  difficult  challenges  in  ensuring  that  TWIC  ac-
cess control technologies will work effectively in the maritime environment, be com-
patible with TWIC cards that will be issued soon, and balance security with the flow 
of maritime commerce. 
TSA  and  Its  Contractor  Face  Challenges  in  Enrolling  and  Issuing  TWIC  Cards  to 

Large Populations of Workers at Numerous Port Facilities and Vessels 

In  September  of  2006,  we  reported  that  TSA  faced  the  challenge  of  enrolling  and 
issuing TWIC cards to a significantly larger population of workers in a timely man-
ner  than  was  done  during  testing  of  the  TWIC  program.  In  testing  the  TWIC  pro-
gram, TSA enrolled and issued TWIC cards to only about 1,700 workers at 19 facili-
ties,  well  short  of  its  goal  of  75,000.  According  to  TSA  and  the  testing  contractor, 
the  lack  of  volunteers  to  enroll  in  the  TWIC  program  testing  and  technical  difficul-
ties in enrolling workers, such as difficulty in obtaining workers’ fingerprints to con-
duct  background  checks,  led  to  fewer  enrollments  than  expected.  TSA  reports  that 
it  used  the  testing  experience  to  make  improvements  to  the  enrollment  and  card 
issuance  process  and  has  taken  steps  to  address  the  challenges  that  we  previously 
identified.  For  example,  TSA  officials  stated  that  the  agency  will  use  a  faster  and 
easier method of collecting fingerprints than was used during testing and will enroll 
workers individually during implementation, as opposed to enrolling in large groups, 
as  was  done  during  testing.  In  addition,  the  TWIC  enrollment  contract  Statement 
of  Work  requires  the  contractor  to  develop  an  enrollment  test  and  evaluation  pro-
gram  to  ensure  that  enrollment  systems  function  as  required  under  the  contract. 
Such  a  testing  program  will  be  valuable  to  ensure  that  these  systems  work  effec-
tively  prior  to  full-scale  implementation.  We  also  reported  that  TSA  faced  the  chal-
lenge  of  ensuring  that  workers  are  not  providing  false  information  and  counterfeit 
identification documents when they enroll in the TWIC program. According to TSA, 
the  TWIC  enrollment  process  to  be  used  during  implementation  will  use  document 
scanning and verification software to help determine if identification documents are 
fraudulent,  and  personnel  responsible  for  enrolling  workers  will  be  trained  to  iden-
tify fraudulent documents. 

Since we issued our report in September 2006, we have also identified additional 
challenges  to  implementing  the  TWIC  program  that  warrant  attention  by  TSA  and 
its  enrollment  contractor.  We  recently  spoke  with  some  maritime  stakeholders  that 
participated in TWIC testing and that will be involved in the initial implementation 
of  the  program  to  discuss  their  views  on  the  challenges  of  enrolling  and  issuing 
TWIC  cards  to  workers.  These  stakeholders  expressed  concerns  regarding  the  fol-
lowing issues: 

Educating  workers:  TSA  and  its  enrollment  contractor  face  a  challenge  in  identi-
fying  all  workers  that  are  required  to  obtain  a  TWIC  card,  educating  them  about 
how  to  enroll  and  receive  a  TWIC  card,  and  ensuring  that  they  enroll  and  receive 
a  TWIC  card  by  the  deadlines  to  be  established  by  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard.  For 
example,  while  longshoremen  who  work  at  a  port  every  day  may  be  aware  of  the 
new TWIC requirements, truck divers that deliver to the port may be located in dif-
ferent states or countries, and may not be aware of the requirements.

26 

Timely  enrollments:  One  stakeholder  expressed  concern  about  the  challenges  the 
enrollment  contractor  faces  in  enrolling  workers  at  his  port.  For  example,  at  this 
port,  the  enrollment  contractor  has  not  yet  begun  to  lease  space  to  install  enroll-
ment  centers—which  at  this  port  could  be  a  difficult  and  time-consuming  task  due 
to  the  shortage  of  space.  Stakeholders  we  spoke  to  also  suggested  that  until  TSA 
establishes  a  deadline  for  when  TWIC  cards  will  be  required  at  ports,  workers  will 
likely  procrastinate  in  enrolling,  which  could  make  it  difficult  for  the  contractor  to 
enroll large populations of workers in a timely manner. 

Background  checks:  Some  maritime  organizations  are  concerned  that  many  of 
their  workers  will  be  disqualified  from  receiving  a  TWIC  card  by  the  background 
check. These stakeholders emphasized the importance of TSA establishing a process 
to ensure timely appeals and waivers process for the potentially large population of 
workers that do not pass the check. According to TSA, the agency already has estab-
lished  processes  for  conducting  background  checks,  appeals,  and  waivers  for  other 
background  checks  of  transportation  workers.  In  addition,  TSA  officials  stated  that 
the  agency  has  established  agreements  with  the  Coast  Guard  to  use  their  adminis-
trative law judges for appeal and waiver cases and plans to use these processes for 
the TWIC background check. 
TSA  and  Industry  Stakeholders  Face  Challenges  in  Ensuring  That  TWIC  Access 
Control  Technologies  Work  Effectively  and  Balancing  Security  With  the  Flow  of 
Maritime Commerce 

In  our  September  2006  report,  we  noted  that  TSA  and  maritime  industry  stake-
holders  faced  significant  challenges  in  ensuring  that  TWIC  access  control  tech-
nologies,  such  as  biometric  card  readers,  worked  effectively  in  the  maritime  sector. 
Few  facilities  that  participated  in  TWIC  testing  used  biometric  card  readers  that 
will  be  required  to  read  the  TWIC  cards  in  the  future.  As  a  result,  TSA  obtained 
limited  information  on  the  operational  effectiveness  of  biometric  card  readers,  par-
ticularly  when  individuals  use  these  readers  outdoors  in  the  harsh  maritime  envi-
ronment,  where  they  can  be  affected  by  dirt,  salt,  wind,  and  rain.  In  addition,  TSA 
did  not  test  the  use  of  biometric  card  readers  on  vessels,  although  they  will  be  re-
quired  on  vessels  in  the  future.  Also,  industry  stakeholders  we  spoke  to  were  con-
cerned about the costs of implementing and operating TWIC access control systems, 
linking  card  readers  to  their  local  access  control  systems,  connecting  to  TSA’s  na-
tional  TWIC  database  to  obtain  updated  security  information  on  workers,  and  how 
biometric  card  readers  would  be  implemented  and  used  on  vessels  and  how  these 
vessels  would  communicate  with  TSA’s  national  TWIC  database  remotely.  Because 
of comments regarding TWIC access control technology challenges that TSA received 
from  maritime  industry  stakeholders  on  the  TWIC  proposed  rule,  TSA  decided  to 
exclude all access control requirements from the TWIC rule issued in January 2007. 
Instead,  TSA  plans  to  issue  a  second  proposed  rule  pertaining  to  access  control  re-
quirements  in  2008,  which  will  allow  more  time  for  maritime  stakeholders  to  com-
ment  on  the  technology  requirements  and  TSA  to  address  the  challenges  that  we 
and stakeholders identified. 

Our September 2006 report also highlighted the challenges that TSA and industry 
stakeholders  face  in  balancing  the  security  benefits  of  the  TWIC  program  with  the 
impact  the  program  could  have  on  maritime  commerce.  If  implemented  effectively, 
the  security  benefits  of  the  TWIC  program  in  preventing  a  terrorist  attack  could 
save lives and avoid a costly disruption in maritime commerce. Alternatively, if key 
components of the TWIC program, such as biometric card readers, do not work effec-
tively, they could slow the daily flow of maritime commerce. For example, if workers 
or truck drivers have problems with their fingerprint verifications on biometric card 
readers,  they  could  create  long  queues  delaying  other  workers  or  trucks  waiting  in 
line  to  enter  secure  areas.  Such  delays  could  be  very  costly  in  terms  of  time  and 
money to maritime facilities. Some stakeholders we spoke to also expressed concern 
with applying TWIC access control requirements to small facilities and vessels. For 
example,  smaller  vessels  could  have  crews  of  less  than  10  persons,  and  checking 
TWIC  cards  each  time  a  person  enters  a  secure  area  may  not  be  necessary.  TSA 
acknowledged  the  potential  impact  that  the  TWIC  program  could  have  on  the  flow 
of maritime commerce and plans to obtain additional public comments on this issue 
from  industry  stakeholders  and  develop  solutions  to  these  challenges  in  the  second 
rulemaking on access control technologies. 

In our September 2006 report, we recommended that TSA conduct additional test-
ing  to  ensure  that  TWIC  access  control  technologies  work  effectively  and  that  the 
TWIC  program  balances  the  added  security  of  the  program  with  the  impact  that  it 
could  have  on  the  flow  of  maritime  commerce.  As  required  by  the  SAFE  Port  Act, 
TSA  plans  to  conduct  a  pilot  program  to  test  TWIC  access  control  technologies  in 
the  maritime  environment.  According  to  TSA,  the  pilot  will  test  the  performance  of

27 

biometric  card  readers  at  various  maritime  facilities  and  on  vessels  as  well  as  the 
impact that these access control systems have on facilities and vessel business oper-
ations.  TSA  plans  to  use  the  results  of  this  pilot  to  develop  the  requirements  and 
procedures for implementing and using TWIC access control technologies in the sec-
ond rulemaking. 
Conclusion 

Preventing unauthorized persons from entering secure areas of the Nation’s ports 
and  other  transportation  facilities  is  critical  to  preventing  a  terrorist  attack.  The 
TWIC  program  was  initiated  in  December  2001  to  mitigate  the  threat  of  terrorists 
accessing  secure  areas.  Since  our  September  2006  report,  TSA  has  made  progress 
toward  implementing  the  program,  including  issuing  a  TWIC  rule,  taking  steps  to 
implement  requirements  of  the  SAFE  Port  Act,  and  awarding  a  contract  to  enroll 
workers  in  the  program.  While  TSA  plans  to  begin  enrolling  workers  and  issuing 
TWIC cards in the next few months, it is important that the agency establish clear 
and  reasonable  time-frames  for  implementing  TWIC.  TSA  officials  told  us  that  the 
agency  has  taken  steps  to  improve  contract  oversight  and  communication  and  co-
ordination  with  its  maritime  TWIC  stakeholders  since  September  2006.  While  the 
steps  that  TSA  reports  taking  should  help  to  address  the  contract  planning  and 
oversight  problems  that  we  have  previously  identified  and  recommendations  we 
have  made,  the  effectiveness  of  these  steps  will  not  be  clear  until  implementation 
of the TWIC program begins. In addition, significant challenges remain in enrolling 
about  770,000  persons  at  about  3,500  facilities  in  the  TWIC  program.  As  a  result, 
it  is  important  that  TSA  and  the  enrollment  contractor  make  communication  and 
coordination  a  priority  to  ensure  that  all  individuals  and  organizations  affected  by 
the  TWIC  program  are  aware  of  their  responsibilities.  Further,  TSA  and  industry 
stakeholders need to address challenges regarding enrollment and TWIC access con-
trol technologies to ensure that the program is implemented effectively. It is impor-
tant  that  TSA  and  the  enrollment  contractor  develop  a  strategy  to  ensure  that  any 
potential problems that these challenges could cause are addressed during TWIC en-
rollment  and  card  issuance.  Finally,  it  will  be  critical  that  TSA  ensure  that  the 
TWIC access control technology pilot program fully test all aspects of the TWIC pro-
gram on a full scale in the maritime environment and the results be used to ensure 
a successful implementation of these technologies in the future. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  answer  any 

questions that you or other members of the Committee may have at this time. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG [presiding].  Thank  you  very  much.  Mr. 
Hawley,  how  many  workers  nationwide  do  you  expect  will  need 
TWIC cards? 

Mr. HAWLEY. The initial estimate is somewhere between 750,000 

and 1.5 million. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. That’s a fairly broad spread. Well, the Port 
of  New  York  and  New  Jersey  currently  issues  some  form  of  ID  to 
allow  access  to  port  facilities,  and  they  believe  that  they  need 
128,000  TWIC  cardholders  among  the  workers.  And  that’s  double 
what TSA’s contractor has estimated. So, what figures does TSA in-
tend to use? Because that’s going to determine what resources need 
to be available to provide these cards in a timely and efficient man-
ner. 

Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. I think it points out some of the improve-
ments  that  have  been  made  recently  in  the  program,  in  that  the 
contractor, in this case Lockheed Martin, is paid by the card. That’s 
their  incentive  to  do  it  quickly  and  well.  It  is  scaleable  and  if  we 
need  to  increase  the  number  of  cards,  they’re  able  to  scale  right 
along with that. And so, we do not have a situation where we have 
got  a  particular  appropriation  that  we  have  to  fit  everything  in.  It 
is  whatever  the  Coast  Guard  identifies  as  those  positions,  or  the 
people who work in areas, that need this security. As many people 
that fall under that category, our contractor has the capacity to en-
roll. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. But it has to be paid for. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

28 

Mr. HAWLEY. Yes. It’s paid for by itself. In other words, when the 
port worker pays $137.25, that pays for the card and what’s behind 
it. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Is it fair to ask the cardholders, the work-
ers,  to  pay  for,  $137  in  fee  if  the  card  readers  are  not  going  to  be 
in place at the time? It’s not fair to ask them to underwrite a devel-
opment program. 

Mr. HAWLEY. They’re not underwriting the development. They’re 
underwriting  the  cost  of  their  card;  and  it’s  a  professional  creden-
tial  that  they  have.  It  comes  out  to  about  $30  a  year  that  it  will 
cost them. So, it has less to do with the specific workplace, and ev-
erything  to  do  about  that  individual.  Because  once  an  individual 
has  a  TWIC  card,  they  have  been  verified.  They  can  take  it  any-
where  in  the  maritime  sector.  It  will  first,  work,  and  second,  meet 
all  of  the  security  requirements  without  question.  So,  it’s  an  ex-
traordinary  value  to  the  individuals  who  get  them;  and  for  $30  a 
year, that’s a good deal. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  how  about  the  value  to  the  country? 
It  seems  unfair  to  me  to  ask  them  to  pay  for  something  that  still 
has  a  long  way  to  go  in  terms  of  development.  How  many  card 
readers are there in place now? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Well,  those  are  done  in  the  private  sector,  and  the 
ones  that  will  be  specifically  related  to  TWIC,  we’ve  put  that  off 
based  on  the  stakeholders  input,  including  all  of  the  workers,  of 
wanting  to  have  a  full  opportunity  to  explore  that,  and  have  a  no-
tice  and  comment  period  before  that  is  selected.  So,  the  card  is 
flexible  enough  to  be  compatible  with  the  standards  that  are  se-
lected. 

And,  I  think  as  Admiral  Salerno  mentioned,  our  Advisory  Com-
mittee  has  come  back  with  draft  standards  for  that,  that  showed 
the way. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  How  is  that  cost  determined,  Mr.  Hawley; 
to  be  sufficient  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  card  preparation.  And  if 
someone  has  a  short-term  job  going  into  the  port,  are  they  going 
to have to pay $135 or $137? And depending upon the private sec-
tor,  not  fully,  to  have  the  card  readers  there,  and  they’re  not  in 
place at this point. 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  That’s  correct.  But  there  is  significant  security 
value  for  the  card.  Just  having  the  card,  and  as  Admiral  Salerno 
mentioned,  the  check-in.  Maybe  the  Admiral  could  mention  the 
new-hire process and the other security. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Wouldn’t  it,  according  to  your  policy,  Ad-
miral  Salerno,  only  Coast  Guard  personnel  can  confiscate  a  mis-
used  TWIC  card.  Local  law  enforcement,  and  they  are  limited  to 
holding  an  individual  until  Coast  Guard  personnel  arrives  to  con-
fiscate  the  TWIC  card.  That’s  a  pretty  cumbersome  system. 
Wouldn’t  it  make  more  sense  to  allow  bona  fide  law  enforcement 
officials to confiscate a TWIC card based on a reasonable cause? 

Admiral  SALERNO.  Senator,  the  policy  was  put  in  place  so  that 
we  could  maintain  control  over  the  system.  The  facility  operator 
has  the  authority  to  deny  entry  to  any  person  that  does  not  have 
reason to be on the facility, so we would anticipate—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Can they confiscate the card?

Admiral  SALERNO.  They  would  not  confiscate  the  card,  that 

would be done by Coast Guard personnel. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  if  a  card  has  been  denied  access, 
then  that  would  obviously  have  to  be  proven,  perhaps,  in  a  court 
room.  How  efficient  can  the  system  be  if  they  have  to  wait  for 
Coast Guard to catch up with this person, and confiscate the card? 
Admiral  SALERNO.  Senator,  we  do—as  you  know—have  a  pres-
ence  in  all  of  the  major  ports,  and  have  teams  of  people  who  are 
tasked  with  conducting  facility  inspections,  and  vessel  inspections, 
and  it’s  a  part  of  their  job  description  that  they  would  visit  these 
facilities on a regular basis. So, by notifying the Coast Guard, these 
teams could be dispatched to take whatever action—— 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  think  you’re  going  to  have  to  look  very 
deeply  into  that  problem,  because  it  seems  to  me  that  the  Coast 
Guard is busy altogether. I always think that the Coast Guard has 
been  issued  too  many  assignments  for  the  body  of  personnel  that 
it  has.  And  when  I  think  of  them  having  to  run  down  and  con-
fiscate the card. 

And  I  think  about  an  employer’s  dilemma—got  a  lot  of  work  to 
do,  I’m  going  to  pick  up  these  cards  from  these  three  fellows,  and 
put them aside—would they only be people that were on they, who 
don’t qualify to pass the terrorist watch list? 

Admiral  SALERNO.  It  would  be,  in  cases  where  it  appears  to  be 
held  by  a  person  who’s  not  entitled  to  a  card,  some  fraudulent  ac-
tivity.  It  would  not  be  based  on  the  background  check  itself,  that 
would  be  done—we  would  not  issue  a  card  unless  a  person  has 
passed the background check. It would only be in cases where there 
appears to be something inappropriate taking place. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Without  these  card  readers  in  place,  I 

think what we’ll see is more confusion and longer delays. 

Mr.  Hawley,  it’s  my  understanding  that  TSA  has  suggested  tak-
ing resources from the Port Security Grant Program to pay for the 
TWIC  pilot  project.  Why  wasn’t  funding  requested  separately  for 
the pilot project? 

Mr. HAWLEY. Well, the pilot project relates to access control, and 
that has to be the subject of—it will have pilots, and then the rule-
making.  The  standards  are  just  now  being  set.  And  we  have  a 
number  of  ports  who  have  come  forward,  including  ports  in  New 
York,  and  New  Jersey,  who  are  anxious  to  be  among  the  pilot. 
Since it is a permanent part of the port infrastructure that they’re 
doing,  it  is  eligible  for  the  Port  Security  Grant.  So,  that  is  a  way 
to  jumpstart  the  program,  and  then  as  we  work  further  to  define 
the  nature  of  the  other  pilots,  that’s  when  we’ll  look  at  the  money 
and see if we need more, and if we do, we’ll ask for it. 

But,  the  Port  Security  Grants,  that’s  what  they’re  for,  and  this 
is  a  process  that’s  already  underway,  and  they  can  move  very 
quickly to get them going. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Are  you  comfortable  with  the  progress 
made thus far, and the ability to set a target date to get things rel-
atively  in  place  to  effectively  read  the  cards?  What’s  the  timeline 
that you suggest would be a timeline that could be met? And where 
we’re really getting a test of this—I mean, issuing the cards is one 
part  of  it,  but  I  think  the  larger  part  in  terms  of  having  it  work

effectively  is  whether  or  not  these  can  be  read  electronically,  and 
with some degree of dispatch, get them done? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Yes,  I  think  the—one  of  the  features  of  the  stand-
ard  that  we’ll  have  for  the  access  control  system  is  the  flexibility 
to  allow  the  individual  operators  to  use  their  own  existing  access 
control. That can be enabled on the card. So the TWIC cards, when 
issued, will be able to be used immediately in that environment. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well.  We  don’t  have  to  look  through  the 

list to—— 

Senator CARPER. It’s just us. 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—see who’s next. Senator Carper? 

STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE 

Senator  CARPER.  Gentlemen,  welcome.  It’s  good  to  see  you,  Sec-
retary Hawley, Admiral Salerno. I said to Beth Osborne, a member 
of  my  staff,  ‘‘Is  it  my  imagination,  or  are  the  Admirals  getting 
younger?’’ 

Mr. Rabkin, thank you for coming, and thanks for all of the good 

work that you do at GAO. 

We  have  a  special  interest  in  this  particular  issue  in  Delaware 
because  of  the  Port  of  Wilmington.  Not  everybody  in  the  audience 
who  might  be  watching  this  hearing  knows  that  the  Port  of  Wil-
mington is the top banana port, and we all want to be top banana 
in  some  respect  or  the  other,  and  for  us  in  Delaware,  our  port  is 
a  place  where  a  lot  of  bananas  come  through.  If  you  ate  a  banana 
this  morning  with  your  cereal,  there’s  a  pretty  good  chance  that  it 
came through the Port of Wilmington. We’re a big port for Chilean 
fruit, all kinds of stuff that we bring through that helps feed—espe-
cially people on the eastern side of our country. 

We  bring  in  other  things,  and  export  among  other  things,  the 
Saturn Sky. We don’t export a lot of automobiles, but we export the 
Saturn Sky, made in Wilmington, Delaware by GM. 

But,  we’re  proud  of  our  port,  and  it’s  a  major  employer,  and  not 
just at the port, but also helps support a variety of businesses and 
parts  of  our  economy,  not  just  in  Delaware,  but  in  the  Greater 
Delaware  Valley  and  the  Del  Mar  Peninsula.  So,  we  have  more 
than a little bit of interest, as you might imagine. 

This  is  an  issue  we’ve  followed  for  a  few  years  in  Delaware,  and 
Delaware  was  the  first  state  to  ratify  the  Constitution  and  our 
moniker  is  ‘‘The  First  State’’—we  like  to  be  first  in  a  whole  lot  of 
things. 

I  think  we  might  get  to  be  first  with  respect  to  the  TWIC  card. 
And,  it  has  taken  us  awhile  to  get  here,  and  one  of  the  questions 
I  wanted  to  ask,  and  one  of  the  things  I’d  like  to  explore  with  the 
panel  is  a  little  bit  of  chronology.  When  was  the  first  gleam  in 
somebody’s eye that there ought to be a TWIC card, and did it grow 
out of legislation in 2001, was it part of the Patriot Act, was there, 
was  it  part  of  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act,  is  that 
where the genesis really lies? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  I  believe  out  of  MTSA  was  where  TWIC  was  origi-

Senator CARPER. All right. Could somebody just kind of walk me 
through  the  TWIC  in  terms—I  think,  if  someone  had  said  back 

nated. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

when the legislation was enacted that we’d still be here, and, in the 
Spring  of  2007,  waiting  to  implement  the  program,  in  even  one 
port, I think folks would have been surprised. We’re told, the folks 
in Wilmington, the Port of Wilmington are told that we can antici-
pate  the  initial  deployment  maybe  in  May,  and  now  we’re  hearing 
it may not be May, we were told before it was before May. 

So, first question—somebody, I don’t care, Mr. Rabkin, if it’s you, 
I  don’t  care,  Secretary  Hawley,  if  it’s  you—somebody  just  kind  of 
walk us through why it has taken this long? 

Mr.  Hawley,  you’ve  not  been  in  your  job  forever,  I  know  that,  I 

know that—how many years have you been there? 

Mr. HAWLEY. About a year and a half. 
Senator CARPER. How long does it seem? 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. HAWLEY. About that. 
Senator  CARPER.  OK.  You’ve  not  been  there  since  this  legisla-

tion—but why so long? 

Mr. HAWLEY. Well, it has to do with the system that’s behind the 
card. As you know, it is that network behind the card that is com-
plex.  We  made  some  decisions  in  the  last  year,  that  added  com-
plexity, and therefore, probably time, to the process. But it was, in 
our  view,  worth  it.  It  has  to  be  compliant  with  the  FIPS  201  proc-
ess,  which  is  the  latest  Federal  Government  biometrics  standard. 
So changes were needed to align TWIC with that. We thought that 
was prudent going forward. 

And then there were some privacy data issues, gaps identified by 
our  internal  folks  as  well  as  the  DHS  Inspector  General.  So,  we 
had  to  get  after  those,  and  close  those,  and  that’s  now  done  as  of 
February.  And  the  rulemaking,  we  went  through  a  long  rule-
making.  We  had  1,900  comments.  So  that’s  why,  that’s  why  it  has 
taken so long. 

Senator CARPER. Do you have, do you have a fair amount of con-
fidence  that  we’re  almost—I’ll  use  a  football  metaphor—the  ball  is 
almost in the end zone? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Well,  it—which  end  zone?  No,  but  I  think  the—— 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, I do. I think a year ago, all of the points that 
Mr.  Rabkin  made  and  the  Chairman  made  earlier  in  terms  of 
where  is  your  process;  where  are  your  professional  program  man-
agers, a whole lot of those things have now been fixed. The system 
is  built.  We’ve  awarded  the  procurement;  and  now  we’re  in  the 
stage of testing. The hard part about testing is you just don’t know 
how  long  it’s  going  to  take,  because  if  it  passes  the  first  try,  we’re 
out  of  here  and  ready  to  go.  And  because  of  the  importance  of  it 
in the real world, we’re not going to move forward until the testing 
is  done.  That  is  the  reason  why  the  cards  are  not  being  issued 
today, because the testing is not complete. 

So,  in  answer  to  the  Port  of  Wilmington,  which  will  be  first  for 
TWIC and when I mentioned in my opening about the port commu-
nity  being  enormously  forthcoming  and  constructive,  the  Port  of 
Wilmington  leads  that  charge,  and  we  will  have  a  minimum  of  a 
45-day head start before we begin to go to the port and start enroll-
ment. So, whenever we get to that point, the TSA, the Coast Guard

will  communicate  with  the  port,  and  then  there  will  be  plenty  of 
time to get the thing up and running. 

Senator CARPER. Thank you. 
Mr. Rabkin, should we be encouraged that we’re making reason-
able progress and the expectations that Secretary Hawley has sug-
gested will be realized? 

Mr.  RABKIN.  Well,  I  think  there’s  reasonable  progress,  but  I’m 
not  as  optimistic  as  the  Secretary  is  about  how  much  has  been 
shown, and how close we are—if I may—to the goal line. TSA con-
ducted a prototype test that was underwhelming, it did not achieve 
any  of  its  goals,  although  it  did  create  some  lessons  to  be  learned, 
and I think the TSA has learned those lessons. 

They still have to meet certain deadlines, they have to hold their 
contractor accountable for getting this next test of issuing cards in 
the 10 highest-risk ports done, and it’s not off to a very auspicious 
start, because it’s delayed there, and we’re still not confident about 
when it’s even going to start, let alone finish. 

And then, that’s just getting the cards out. It’s a very important 
process,  but  from  my  perspective,  that’s  the  easy  part.  And  then 
they  have  to  move  the  technology,  and  having  it  work,  and  work 
quickly and work accurately, all the time, is, I think, even more of 
a major challenge. So, there’s a lot to be done yet. 

Senator CARPER. Let me follow up with a question about commu-
nication;  between  TSA  and  whether  it’s  the  Port  of  Wilmington  or 
other  ports  that  will  be  coming  down  the  road  here.  Just  tell  us 
about the quality of that communication, are you satisfied with it? 
Is it getting better? We’ve been told it has been—from our perspec-
tive, not very good. 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Well,  I  think  the  communication  is  excellent,  actu-
ally. And, it’s a team thing between the Coast Guard and TSA, and 
now our contractor. And we’ve stood up a formal consultative group 
to formalize that process. 

Senator  CARPER.  I’m  talking  about  communicating  with  ports, 

with the folks that are—— 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Well,  first  of  all,  the  Coast  Guard  is  in  the  port. 
Admiral SALERNO. If I may, sir—— 
Senator CARPER. Please. 
Admiral  SALERNO.  In  each  port  there  is  a,  what  we  call  an  Area 
of  Maritime  Security  Committee  which  represents  a  broad  cross- 
section  of  stakeholders  in  the  port.  In  addition,  there  is  a  harbor 
safety  committee,  which  again,  represents  broad  sections  of  the 
port. One is for security purposes, one for safety, but each of them 
represent opportunities to reach out and communicate with the full 
spectrum of port stakeholders. 

We  have  communicated  with  our  staffs  in  all  of  the  ports,  and 
have prepped them to make this outreach in a very deliberate way, 
in  conjunction  with  TSA  and  with  the  contractor.  Essentially, 
they’re waiting for the green light on the go-ahead that, you know, 
once  we  have  the  schedule  established,  there  will  be  a  very  delib-
erate  process  of  informing  people.  It  will  start  with  a  notice  in  the 
Federal Register, but there will be—you know, to make it official— 
but  there  will  be  all  sorts  of  informal  means,  including  these  com-
mittees, to get the word out to people.

Senator  CARPER.  I  think  there’s  a  disconnect  here.  Because  the 
people  who  run  our  port,  the  folks  who  work  there,  believe  there 
has  not  been  good—in  fact,  the  word  was  given  to  me  as  ‘‘poor’’ 
communication.  So  there  are  some  differences  between  ‘‘excellent’’ 
and ‘‘poor.’’ And, we always say, ‘‘The customer’s always right.’’ I’m 
not sure who the customer is here, but it could be the port and the 
folks that the port serves. 

But,  the  message  I  would  ask  you  to  take  back  to  your  folks  is, 
people in my port are not pleased with the communication with the 
program  managers  and  I  would  just  ask  you  to,  let’s  do  better.  I 
know,  everything  I  do,  I  could  do  better,  and  I  suspect  the  same 
is  true  here.  So  I’d  ask  that  you  re-double  your  efforts.  OK.  All 
right. 

Mr. HAWLEY. Yes, sir. 
Senator  CARPER.  Could  I  ask  just  one  more  quick  one?  Thanks. 
On  one  hand,  we  want  to  make  sure  that  the  folks  that,  whose 
background  is  such  that  would  raise  alarms  and  concerns—we 
want  to  make  sure  that  they  have  a  system  here  to  catch  those, 
to detect those folks. 

At  the  same  time,  I’ll  be  honest  with  you,  folks  who  work  at  a 
lot  of  these  ports,  whether  it’s  my  port,  or  ports  in  New  Jersey  or 
other  states,  a  lot  of  them  you  would  look  through  the  high  school 
yearbooks, they weren’t picked to be ‘‘Most Likely to Succeed,’’ and 
a lot of them have had troubled pasts, they’ve—some of them have 
been  in  trouble  with  the  law,  some  have  been  incarcerated,  some 
have  been  pardoned,  some  have  not.  And,  let  me  just  ask,  for  the 
folks,  for  some  people  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  this  is  the  first 
good job they’ve ever had, and they’ve straightened themselves out, 
and  they’re  staying  out  of  trouble.  How  do  we  balance  the  desire, 
the earnest desire, to make sure that we’re not allowing people who 
shouldn’t be, who have a past that suggests that they shouldn’t be 
allowed to have access to the port, and do pose a security risk, from 
those  who  just  made  bad  choices  in  their  lives  earlier,  and  have 
straightened themselves out? 

Mr. HAWLEY. It’s a very, very, very important issue, because this 
is  a  credential  to  work.  And,  the  standard  is  terrorist  risk.  And 
that  is  for  what  we  all  hope  is  an  infinitesimal  part  of  the  popu-
lation. 

Our  Hazardous  Materials  Endorsements  in  the  trucking  popu-
lation  is  an  analogy  that  gives  me  some  confidence,  because  we’ve 
done  2.7  million  of  those,  and  the  adjudication  process,  appeal, 
waiver process has been very effective, and has not been the prob-
lem we all might have anticipated. So, we are very, very zeroed in 
on that specific issue. 

Senator  CARPER.  We  want  to  work  with  you  closely  on  that. 

Thank you. 

Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thanks very much, Senator Carper. 
One thing, and that is, according to the schedule as we’ve heard 
it,  we’re  supposed  to  start  issuing  cards  Monday  in  the  New  York/ 
New  Jersey  region.  And,  it’s  now  moved  back,  as  I  understood  you 
to  say,  to  somewhere  in  the  fall.  And,  I  don’t  think  there  can  be 
a  lot  of  optimism  that  this  program  is  going  to  be  meeting  any  of 
the  targets  outlined.  We,  you  said,  that  the  employee  population 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

34 

that  may  be  covered  could  be  750,000,  could  be  1.2  million,  or  1.5 
million. Now, how do you plan to provide the resources, depending 
on what number you finally come up with? 

Mr.  HAWLEY.  Yes.  The  program  is  scaleable.  Using  Port  of  Wil-
mington  as  an  example,  we’ve  already  hired  the  8  trusted  entities 
who will do the enrollment. That is part of the communication with 
the port, to identify how many people are going to be enrolled when 
the  team  goes  in,  and  then  they  scale  up  to  do  it.  So,  I  think,  of 
the  concerns,  that  is  not  one  of  the  major  concerns.  I  think  we’ll 
be  able  to  handle  the  population.  The  part  that  is  most  important 
and  still  out  there  is  the  part  Mr.  Rabkin  mentioned,  in  terms  of 
the extensive testing that is required for the system. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  really  don’t  understand  how  these  pa-
rameters  are  being  dealt  with,  because  to  me  they  don’t  pass  the 
early  testing  that  we’ve  done,  and  we’re  stuck  in  limbo,  and  we’re 
going to ask the employees to pay $137 to get this card, but it may 
not be system-wide. You said that that person could take that card 
anywhere  in  the  country  and  use  it  to  gain  access.  But,  also,  I 
think  the  Admiral  said  that  this  isn’t  necessarily  the  terror  watch 
list,  but  it  could  be  for  any  other  reasons  as  well.  Now,  if  this  is 
going  to  be  presenting  a  person’s  full  background,  looking  at  this 
card,  this  has  got  several  tests  it  has  got  to  pass  so  that  one’s  lib-
erties aren’t encroached upon. 

I’m  sorry,  but  we  have  another  panel  here,  and  we  are  going  to 
have  a  vote  soon.  So,  I  would  ask  that  the  second  panel  of  wit-
nesses be seated. 

Thank you very much for being here with us.

STATEMENT OF LISA B. HIMBER, VICE PRESIDENT, MARITIME 

EXCHANGE FOR THE DELAWARE RIVER AND BAY 

Ms.  HIMBER.  Good  morning,  and  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to 
present  testimony  today,  particularly  on  behalf  of  our  members  in 
New  Jersey  and  Delaware,  who  have  been  involved  in  the  TWIC 
pilot program since its inception in 2002. 

Our  members  of  the  Maritime  Exchange,  include  both  private 
and  public  regulated  facilities,  as  well  as  vessels,  and  the  individ-
uals who need access to secure maritime areas.

I’ve  been  involved  with  the  TWIC  Program  for  its—since  the  be-
ginning—and  in  addition,  as  a  member  of  the  National  Maritime 
Security Advisory Committee, have chaired two working groups de-
veloped to address TWIC issues. 

And,  I  believe  everybody’s  aware  of  the  many  setbacks,  we’ve 
talked  about  some  of  them  today.  My  feeling  is,  despite  the  set-
backs which occurred in the past, the pilot program did allow TSA 
to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  challenges  that  they  will  face  in 
implementing a program of this magnitude. 

My testimony today will focus on issues surfacing from the TWIC 
rulemaking,  as  well  as  concerns  relating  to  the  second  part  of  the 
program, the use of the TWIC readers at ports and vessels. 

In drafting its final rule, it is evident that stakeholder comments 
to  last  year’s  proposed  rule  were  given  serious  consideration.  Par-
ticularly,  we  believe  DHS  made  exactly  the  right  decision  to  sepa-
rate the card issuance, and reader installation processes. Yet, obvi-
ously  in  a  program  of  this  scope,  there  remain  additional  concerns 
about the program. 

First, the rule is silent on casual labor, which is such an integral 
part  of  maritime  operations  that  it  must  not  be  overlooked.  While 
the  rule  does  provide  for  accommodation  for  escorting  non-TWIC 
holders,  there’s  no  clear  pathway  to  implementing  the  escort  re-
quirement  in  any  practical  manner.  In  addition  to  the  operational 
and  physical  impediments,  other  questions  have  arisen  about  the 
escort’s liability and responsibility. 

Similarly, our members are concerned about access for non-TWIC 
holding truck drivers, especially during the initial program roll-out. 
The  second  major  concern  we  have  relates  to  the  costs,  which 
simply  stated,  and  as  you’ve  stated,  are  too  high.  There’s  little  in-
centive  for  individuals  to  seek  employment  at  maritime  facilities 
when the cost of such an employment may exceed his wages for the 
day.  And,  if  the  company  pays—and  some  trade  union  agreements 
require  that  they  do—it  may  cost  several  thousands  more  beyond 
the  cost  of  the  card  to  pay  for  meals,  and  time  spent  applying  for 
and retrieving the card. 

Significant  additional  costs  will  accrue  for  companies  to  escort 
non-TWIC  holders.  This  is  particularly  troublesome  given  that 
some  employers  or  employees  may  pay  for  cards  that  the  individ-
uals never receive, as a result of their security threat assessments. 
Another question has been raised regarding processes for individ-
uals who, for religious reasons, may not have their pictures taken, 
or must have their heads covered when being photographed. 

These  are  just  a  few  of  the  concerns  which  have  surfaced  over 

the last several months, and there are many others. 

On  the  other  hand,  there  are  issues  industry  has  voiced  in  the 
past as preventing successful TWIC implementation, and we would 
like  to  compliment  DHS  on  the  steps  that  they  are  taking  to  ad-
dress them. 

Predominant among these issues is—as everybody has mentioned 
today—has  been  the  problem  of  communicating  information  to 
stakeholders,  particularly  as  it  relates  to  program  setbacks  and 
delays.  But,  we  appreciate  the  creation  of  the  TWIC  Stakeholder 
Communications  Committee,  and  look  forward  to  seeing  some  im-
provement in that regard.

In  addition,  our  local  Coast  Guard  sector,  Delaware  Bay,  has 
done  an  excellent  job  in  facilitating  outreach  and  sharing  informa-
tion as it becomes available. 

Further, we’ve also been concerned that many TWIC technologies 
were  excluded  from  the  pilot  program  tests,  and  we  are  pleased 
that  DHS  will  conduct  an  additional  pilot.  And  for  that,  I’d  like  to 
talk for a minute about the card readers. 

One  of  the  key  concerns  submitted  to  the  proposed  rule  related 
to  the  use  of  contact  cards  in  the  maritime  environment.  In  re-
sponse,  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee  was 
asked  to  develop  recommendations  for  a  contactless  TWIC  reader, 
and  we  completed  that  work  in  February.  There  was  one  critical 
area  where  DHS  and  the  maritime  industry  could  not  come  to 
terms, and that’s whether or not the fingerprint template should be 
encrypted.  This  may  very  well  be  one  of  the  single-most  important 
issues  DHS  will  have  to  address  as  it  enters  the  second  phase  of 
the TWIC rulemaking process. 

Industry  believes  that  individual  privacy  is  more  than  suffi-
ciently  protected  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  the  TWIC  will  not  con-
tain  a  full  fingerprint  image.  There  are  other  outstanding  issues 
surrounding  the  selection  and  use  of  card  reader  technology,  such 
as  the  use  of  a  PIN,  integration  with  existing  port  access  control 
systems, and future expansion of the card, just to name a few. 

In  addition  to  addressing  these  and  other  remaining  questions, 
we  suggest  that  DHS  revisit  its  approach  to  the  TWIC  reader  im-
plementation.  The  Department  should  first  make  the  final  TWIC 
policy decisions, such as the use of readers at low-risk facilities and 
vessels,  or  access  control  recordkeeping  requirements,  and  then 
identify the technology that we need to support them. 

We  also  suggest  that  DHS  work  with  industry  in  the  pilot  pro-
gram design phase, as well as its execution and evaluation and the 
subsequent rulemaking process. 

In closing, let me say that although there are still a lot of serious 
concerns,  DHS  has  made  progress  in  bringing  this  program  to  fru-
ition.  We  remain  committed  to  the  TWIC  Program,  and  want  to 
continue  to  work  with  TSA  and  Coast  Guard,  to  ensure  there  are 
no  unintended  consequences,  and  that  the  program  is  going  to  be 
deployed in the most secure and efficient manner possible. 

And, that concludes my remarks, and I’ll be happy to answer any 

questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LISA B. HIMBER, VICE PRESIDENT, 
MARITIME EXCHANGE FOR THE DELAWARE RIVER AND BAY 

Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  and  members  of  the  Com-
mittee. Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony today. My name is Lisa 
Himber, and I am Vice President of the Maritime Exchange for the Delaware River 
and Bay. The Maritime Exchange is a non-profit trade association representing the 
members  of  the  commercial  maritime  industry  in  Southern  New  Jersey,  South-
eastern  Pennsylvania,  and  Delaware,  and  our  mission  is  to  promote  commerce  at 
Delaware River ports. We accomplish this by engaging on issues and developing pro-
grams  to  support  the  safety,  security,  economic  viability  and  environmental  health 
of the tri-state port complex. Included among our 300 members are those companies 
and  individuals  who  operate,  or  provide  service  to,  the  2,800  vessels  calling  Dela-
ware  River  ports  each  year.  Our  membership  includes  regulated  vessels,  port  au-
thorities and private maritime facilities as well as the many businesses and individ-

uals who need access to one or multiple facilities to do their jobs on a daily basis— 
such as tug and barge companies, steamship agents, labor organizations, surveyors, 
line handlers, and trucking companies, just to name a few. 

Although  the  Maritime  Exchange  is  focused  on  activity  at  Delaware  River  ports, 
we  address  issues  of  national  significance  with  our  sister  maritime  organizations 
under  the  umbrella  of  Maritime  Information  Services  of  North  America,  known  as 
MISNA, as well as through NAMO, the National Association of Maritime Organiza-
tions. 

In  addition,  I  serve  as  Vice  Chair  of  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory 
Committee  (NMSAC),  which  as  you  are  aware  was  established  under  the  Maritime 
Transportation  Security  Act  (MTSA)  of  2002.  NMSAC  has  been  actively  engaged 
with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  on  the  Transportation  Worker  Identi-
fication  Credential  (TWIC)  program  since  its  initial  meeting  in  March  of  2005,  and 
I’ll talk more about our recent accomplishments in a few minutes. 

I  appreciate  this  opportunity  to  discuss  the  TWIC  program  and  issues  associated 
with implementation of the final rule issued in January of this year. TWIC has long 
been  one  of  the  priority  Federal  projects  for  my  organization  and  our  members  in 
the Delaware River maritime community. 
Background 

The Exchange role in the port—Like most associations, the Maritime Exchange is 
an  advocate  on  issues  of  concern  to  its  members,  much  like  a  Chamber  of  Com-
merce. However, what sets the Exchange apart from a traditional trade association 
is  its  operating  role  in  the  port.  The  Exchange  operates  on  a  24/7  basis,  and  one 
of our primary responsibilities is to collect, store and disseminate information on all 
commercial cargo ships moving through the port. We also serve as a maritime infor-
mation  and  communications  hub  for  the  region,  conveying  messages  between  ships 
and their shoreside service providers as well as distributing Federal safety, security, 
operational,  and  procedural  bulletins  to  the  maritime  businesses  community.  Be-
cause  of  the  importance  of  this  function,  which  we  have  been  providing  since  1875, 
coordinating  information  through  the  Maritime  Exchange  communications  center 
has been incorporated into the Area Maritime Security Plan for Coast Guard Sector 
Delaware Bay. 

In  addition  to  our  traditional  Ship  Reporting  function,  in  the  mid-1980s  the  Ex-
change  began  the  development  of  what  is  now  known  as  Maritime  On-Line  (MOL). 
This  system  is  a  community-based  information  network  which  provides  a  mecha-
nism  not  only  to  obtain  anticipated,  current  and  historical  vessel  movement  infor-
mation but also offers a tool for steamship carriers and their agents to submit cargo 
manifest data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and advance electronic notice 
of vessel arrival and departure information to the U.S. Coast Guard. Through MOL, 
the Exchange provides Delaware River port operators with a cost-effective means to 
both  comply  with  Federal  information  reporting  requirements  as  well  as  to  share 
information, such as manifest data or cargo release status, with local public and pri-
vate sector transportation partners through a centralized maritime intelligence sys-
tem. 

Development of a regional standard ID—Because the Exchange had demonstrated 
its  ability  to  bring  together  the  various  maritime  stakeholders  to  develop,  imple-
ment, and use a community information system, several members approached us in 
the late 1990s to discuss the feasibility of developing a system under Maritime On- 
Line which could be used to identify truck drivers accessing the various cargo facili-
ties in the three states. 

The  Exchange  organized  a  working  group  of  system  users  and  developed  a  set  of 
requirements  for  what  would  become  known  as  the  Electronic  Driver  Identification 
(EDID)  System.  By  September  2001,  the  system  design  was  complete,  and  the  Ex-
change was working to identify a means of funding the initial program development. 
The  premise  behind  this  system  was  a  centralized  database  and  the  issuance  of  an 
ID card that would be accepted at all participating Delaware River maritime termi-
nals. 

Immediately  after  the  events  of  September  11,  2001,  Exchange  members  asked 
whether the system we had designed to identify truck drivers could be expanded to 
include  anyone  requiring  access  to  maritime  facilities.  Like  truck  drivers  in  the 
State of Florida, those doing business in the Delaware River were required to obtain 
multiple identification cards, and the maritime community agreed that development 
of a single, standard ID card would be a critical program under new heightened se-
curity programs at maritime facilities. 

As a result, by December 2001, the Exchange, in partnership with the Port of Wil-
mington,  Delaware,  had  identified  funding  to  develop  a  pilot  program,  and  success-

fully  programmed  and  tested  what  would  become  the  Delaware  River  ID  (DRID) 
system.  We  subsequently  received  a  Port  Security  Grant  to  expand  this  program. 
It  was  because  of  this  effort  that  the  Delaware  River  was  selected  as  one  of  the 
TWIC  pilot  program  locations.  It  was  generally  agreed  that  if  such  a  system  could 
work effectively at Delaware River ports, with three states and multiple private and 
public port facilities, it could work at all U.S. ports. 
TWIC Pilot Program 

Having been involved in the TWIC program even prior to the establishment of the 
TSA and the August 2002 launch of the East Coast TWIC pilot project, my organiza-
tion  and  its  members  have  been  keenly  interested  in  the  successful  deployment  of 
this program. 

Members  of  the  Delaware  River  port  community  participated  in  all  three  phases 
of  the  TWIC  pilot  program,  beginning  with  the  Planning  Phase  which  spanned  the 
Fall  of  2002  through  the  Spring  of  2003,  the  Technology  Evaluation  from  May  to 
October of 2003, and the Prototype Phase, which started in November 2004 and offi-
cially ended in June 2005, although TSA continued to support Delaware River sites 
well into 2005. 

I  believe  everyone  is  aware  that  there  were  a  great  number  of  setbacks  which 
plagued  the  TWIC  pilot  program,  which  was  originally  scheduled  for  completion  in 
December  2003.  Despite  some  of  the  problems  encountered  by  the  Transportation 
Security  Administration,  some  of  which  were  discussed  at  a  hearing  before  this 
Committee last May, it seems clear that the pilot program did afford TSA with the 
opportunity  to  gain  an  understanding  of  what  would  be  required  to  implement  a 
program of this magnitude. 
Moving Forward 

Program Deployment—Card Issuance—The Final Rule published in January is an 
extremely  complex  document  which  many  maritime  professionals  are  still  working 
to  comprehend.  However,  we  cannot  emphasize  enough  that  we  believe  the  Depart-
ment of Homeland Security made the right decision in separating the card applica-
tion and issuance processes from the reader installation and usage processes. Taken 
separately,  each  of  these  components  of  the  TWIC  program  is  extremely  intricate 
and  creates  multiple  possibilities  to  unduly  hamper  maritime  operations  if  not  im-
plemented in a thoughtful and deliberate manner; we appreciate that DHS is allow-
ing sufficient time to address the challenges of card issuance prior to attempting to 
introduce the component of accessing and communicating with a central TWIC data-
base,  which  was  never  tested  during  the  pilot  program.  There  is  no  doubt  that  had 
both  phases  been  implemented  concurrently,  the  transition  to  full  program  deploy-
ment would have been fraught with multiple unanticipated problems. 

In drafting its final rule, it is evident that DHS took into consideration the thou-
sands of comments submitted by maritime stakeholders in response to the Proposed 
Rule  published  last  May.  Several  of  the  issues  cited  have  been  addressed,  such  as 
the  need  to  accommodate  temporary  and  seasonal  workers,  and  the  elimination  of 
the  formal  employer  sponsor  relationship.  In  addition,  the  Coast  Guard  drafted  a 
very  clearly-written  and  helpful  Navigation  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular  (NVIC) 
guidance  document;  and  we  appreciated  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  draft 
document  prior  to  its  finalization.  This  is  not  an  opportunity  the  regulated  public 
often enjoys. 

Needless to say, however, in a program of this scope, there still remain some addi-

tional questions and concerns about the regulation. 

First, the rule is silent on the issue of casual labor, which is such an integral part 
of efficient maritime operations that it must not be overlooked. While the regulation 
and the draft NVIC provide accommodation to escort non-TWIC holders, there is no 
clear  pathway  to  implementing  the  escort  requirement.  Foremost  among  the  chal-
lenges is the fact most facilities operators within the Delaware River and elsewhere 
have determined that the secure and restricted areas defined in their security plans 
will be contiguous, such that the entire facilities are restricted. 

The  effect  of  that  decision  directly  relates  to  the  numbers  of  non-TWIC  holders 
who  may  be  escorted  by  any  one-TWIC  holder.  As  outlined  in  the  draft  NVIC,  es-
corting in a restricted area is limited to five non-TWIC holders for every one TWIC- 
holding  escort.  In  addition,  unless  this  guidance  changes  in  the  final  version,  the 
escort  must  be  constant  and  side-by-side  (i.e.,  no  monitoring  via  video  or  random 
patrol). The impact of this can be seen in the following scenarios: at the hiring hall, 
a  longshoreman  offers  to  drive  three  or  four  day  laborers  to  the  pier  to  report  for 
work.  Upon  arrival,  these  individuals  may  be  assigned  to  work  different  ships,  and 
therefore  the  TWIC  holder  is  no  longer  in  a  position  to  serve  as  an  escort  for  the 
others.  Or  perhaps  one  of  the  workers  is  a  female  and  the  TWIC  holder  is  male;

surely he cannot be expected to stay by her side during the entire workday. In any 
case, it is not conceivable that one worker could escort even one individual, let alone 
several  others,  on  a  constant  basis  while  still  fulfilling  his  own  responsibilities.  In 
addition to the practical difficulties, in some cases the physical layout of the marine 
facility  prohibits  the  ability  of  the  card  holder  to  fulfill  his/her  obligations.  For  ex-
ample,  while  it  is  obvious  where  the  vessel  berthed,  the  final  resting  place  of  the 
cargo  is  sometimes  several  hundred  yards—or  even  miles—away  from  the  vessel  in 
a storage yard, warehouse or transit shed. 

Further questions have arisen about the escort’s liability and responsibility. If an 
individual  under  escort  causes  a  Transportation  Security  Incident  or  otherwise  vio-
lates existing laws, regulations or facility/vessel policies, what is the ramification to 
the  escort?  This  question  has  yet  to  be  resolved,  and  depending  on  the  answer,  it 
may be difficult, if not impossible, to identify willing escorts. 

Similar  issues  arise  as  they  relate  to  truck  drivers.  Many  drivers  arrive  at  Dela-
ware  River  ports  from  other  parts  of  the  country.  Of  necessity,  until  the  program 
is  fully  implemented,  these  drivers  will  not  have  their  TWIC  cards,  and  with  the 
sheer  volume  of  trucks  moving  through  facility  gates  every  day,  it  is  not  feasible 
that  facilities,  importers,  or  others  could  provide  resources  to  escort  these  drivers. 
Even  after  initial  TWIC  rollout  is  completed,  there  will  always  be  random  arrivals 
by drivers who had never previously hauled cargo to or from maritime facilities. 

The  card  application  and  issuance  processes  are  not  designed  to  accommodate 
long-haul truck drivers. For example, during initial rollout, if a driver arrives at the 
Port  of  Wilmington,  he  can,  and  should,  apply  for  his  TWIC  card  at  that  time.  Yet 
the processes require that he return to the place of issuance to retrieve and activate 
his  card  after  the  security  threat  assessment  has  been  completed.  Needless  to  say, 
the driver may be long gone from the area with no immediate opportunity to return. 
Suggestions  for  addressing  the  above  issues  include:  allow  TWIC  applicants  to 
designate  that  cards  be  returned  to  a  different  enrollment  center  than  that  where 
the individual originally applied, or include a mechanism to mail a card to an appli-
cant’s  office  or  home—or  other  appropriate  location—after  which  the  individual 
could return to a convenient enrollment location to activate the card. 

In addition, facilities should be given the option to create a ‘‘temporary’’ credential 
or  visitor’s  pass  in  lieu  of  requiring  escorts.  If  appropriate,  when  the  individual’s 
identification  documentation  is  validated,  his  photograph  could  be  taken  and  other 
information  entered  into  the  facility  access  control  system.  If  necessary,  this  infor-
mation could be submitted to DHS. Such a mechanism might be designed along the 
lines  of  the  Florida  ‘‘5  in  90’’  rule:  Florida  State  regulation  allows  for  a  temporary 
credential,  and  if  an  individual  presents  himself  for  access  to  a  regulated  facility 
more  than  5  times  in  90  days,  he  or  she  would  no  longer  be  eligible  for  a  visitor’s 
card and would be required to obtain a Florida card. Needless to say, both DHS and 
the maritime industry would need to agree to mutually acceptable details to imple-
ment such a program within TWIC, but the idea bears consideration. 

A  second  major  concern  relates  to  the  cost  of  the  TWIC  card.  Simply  stated,  the 
cost  is  too  high.  Although  we  anticipated  there  would  be  a  significant  cost  saving 
associated with DHS centralizing the purchasing and production of the cards, these 
do  not  appear  to  have  been  realized.  Again,  keeping  in  mind  that  the  maritime  in-
dustry  is  highly  reliant  on  casual,  seasonal  and  temporary  workers,  there  is  little 
incentive for these individuals to seek employment at maritime facilities and vessels 
when the cost of such employment may exceed his wages for the day. Non-profit or-
ganizations,  such  as  the  Seamen’s  centers  are  also  greatly  impacted  by  the  high 
price  tag.  At  the  Seamen’s  Center  of  Wilmington,  where  I  serve  on  the  Board  of 
Trustees,  the  estimated  cost  to  obtain  TWICs  for  volunteers  is  $8,000;  this  rep-
resents an 8 percent increase in operating expenses for the upcoming year. Also, of 
particular  concern  is  the  fact  that  an  applicant  is  required  to  pay  the  full  price  at 
application,  even  if  he/she  is  subsequently  denied  a  card  and  it  is  never  produced. 
TSA  should  charge  only  the  cost  of  processing  the  enrollment  application  and  for 
the  security  threat  assessment,  with  the  balance  to  be  paid  only  after  the  card  is 
produced and activated. 

Third,  one  additional  question  has  recently  surfaced  in  our  region:  how  can  we 
process  TWIC  applications  for  individuals  who  for  religions  reasons  may  not  have 
their  pictures  taken  or  require  that  their  heads  be  covered  when  photographed? 
While I would not hazard a suggestion on how to address such an issue, it may not 
have  previously  been  considered  and  is  certainly  a  challenge  DHS  will  need  to  ad-
dress. 

These  are  just  a  few  of  the  questions  and  concerns  which  have  been  raised  over 
the last several months; there are countless others—far too many to address today. 
However, we expect that many of these will be resolved when the final NVIC is re-
leased.

In addition, there are a few issues the Maritime Exchange and others have raised 
in  the  past  as  preventing  successful  TWIC  implementation,  and  we  compliment 
DHS on the steps taken to address them. 

Predominant among these has been the problem of successfully communicating in-
formation  to  the  maritime  industry—particularly  as  it  relates  to  program  setbacks 
and  delays.  We  appreciate  that  that  the  Lockheed  Martin  contracting  team  has  es-
tablished  a  TWIC  Stakeholder  Communications  Committee  specifically  to  address 
the  issues  of  communications.  To  date,  the  Committee  has  held  only  one  meeting, 
so we are not yet in a position to evaluate its effectiveness; however we remain opti-
mistic  and  look  forward  to  working  with  the  TWIC  team  toward  a  successful  and 
smooth implementation. 

In  addition  to  efforts  underway  at  the  national  level,  our  local  Coast  Guard  per-
sonnel, who are responsible for coordinating activities between TSA, the contractors 
and  the  maritime  community,  have  done  an  excellent  job  over  the  last  several 
months  in  facilitating  outreach  sessions,  helping  identify  enrollment  center  loca-
tions,  and  providing  maritime  stakeholders  with  information  as  it  becomes  avail-
able.  We  are  confident  that  local  Coast  Guard  will  approach  the  implementation 
and,  ultimately,  enforcement  of  the  TWIC  program  with  the  flexibility  it  demands. 
In  addition,  during  the  last  5  years,  many  have  held  the  belief  that  the  constant 
turnover in DHS, TSA and TWIC program office leadership has contributed signifi-
cantly  to  the  ongoing  delay  in  implementing  the  program.  Over  the  last  year,  the 
personnel  roster  has  been  completely  stable,  and  we  are  pleased  to  note  that  DHS 
seems to have addressed some of the internal issues associated with employee turn-
over. 

Finally,  the  Exchange  and  others  have  expressed  concerns  about  the  fact  that 
many  of  the  critical  technologies,  such  as  communication  with  the  database,  use  of 
biometrics,  or  individual  (versus  corporate)  program  enrollment  were  not  tested,  or 
tested  insufficiently,  during  the  original  TWIC  pilot  program.  We  appreciate  that 
DHS, as required by the SAFE Port Act, will conduct a TWIC pilot program to test 
reader technology and processes. 

Installation  and  Usage  of  Card  Readers—As  stated  previously,  DHS  elected  to 
defer this component of TWIC implementation. We enthusiastically applaud this de-
cision and appreciate the efforts of DHS to work with industry to determine the ap-
propriate technology for use in the maritime environment. 

One of the key concerns expressed by those commenting on the Proposed Rule last 
Spring  related  to  the  use  of  contact  cards.  Requiring  that  a  card  be  swiped  at  a 
TWIC  reader  would  not  only  significantly  delay  maritime  operations,  but  contact 
readers  are  more  susceptible  to  failure  due  to  environmental  elements,  and  they 
also  present  an  easy  and  attractive  target  to  vandals.  In  response,  last  November 
DHS  asked  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee  to  develop  rec-
ommendations  for  a  contactless  card  reader  which  could  be  used  at  ports  and  ves-
sels. 

NMSAC  agreed  to  accept  this  challenge,  and  it  was  my  pleasure  to  co-chair  the 
working group established to develop the recommendations. The Working Group in-
cluded  approximately  130  individuals,  not  including  the  Federal  Government  par-
ticipants, and was organized into a maritime team and a security technology indus-
try team. The maritime group was comprised of public and private terminal owners 
and operators, vessel owners and operators, maritime labor and employer organiza-
tions, trade associations, and a host of others. These individuals, with counsel of the 
security  industry  team  members  spent  the  months  of  December  2006  and  January 
2007  developing  a  series  of  operating  requirements  which  would  guide  the  develop-
ment  of  the  technical  documentation.  This  document  was  completed  by  mid-Feb-
ruary in advance of the February 28 deadline established by DHS. 

For the most part, the technical team was able to meet the requirements outlined 
by  the  maritime  industry  representatives,  and  the  technical  specification  endorsed 
by NMSAC reflects the combined efforts of the full working group. 

However, there remains one critical area where the DHS and the maritime indus-
try  could  not  come  to  terms.  This  relates  to  the  level  of  protection  which  should  be 
placed on the fingerprint template transferred between the TWIC card and the read-
er.  This  is  one  of  the  single  most  important  issues  DHS  will  have  to  address  as  it 
enters the second phase of the TWIC rulemaking process. 

In  its  simplest  form,  DHS  has  stated  that  the  fingerprint  template  is  to  be 
encrypted;  the  maritime  industry  holds  that  individual  privacy  is  more  than  suffi-
ciently  protected  simply  by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  the  TWIC  will  not  contain  a  full 
fingerprint  image  but  only  a  minutiae  template  which  cannot  be  re-generated  if  it 
is ‘‘stolen’’ during contactless transmission. 

The following text is excerpted directly from the NMSAC recommendations:

A.  Privacy  and  Security  Considerations—NMSAC  supports  the  inclusion  of 
measures to protect individual privacy and acknowledges that this prerequisite, 
along with the need to enhance commerce and improve transportation security, 
has  been  included  as  a  required  goal  of  the  TWIC  program  since  it  was  an-
nounced in February 2002. 
It is our understanding that all personally identifiable information about an in-
dividual gathered during enrollment will be retained by TSA in its central data 
bank. The card itself is expected to show and/or contain a photo, a unique card-
holder  identification  number,  and  the  individual’s  biometric  fingerprint  tem-
plate. 
In its design, TSA wisely elected to utilize the fingerprint template rather than 
a full fingerprint image specifically to address both privacy and operational effi-
ciency  concerns.  Since  only  a  fingerprint  template  will  be  passed  between  the 
card  and  the  TWIC  reader,  the  information  cannot  be  reverse-engineered  to  a 
full fingerprint image. 
Even  if  the  template  were  ‘‘stolen’’  during  contactless  transmission  to  a  TWIC 
reader,  and  even  if  somehow  it  could  be  used  to  replicate  the  original  finger-
print, for which we understand no technology currently exists, the ‘‘thief’’ would 
not  be  able  to  use  this  illegal  TWIC  as  the  fingerprint  image  would  not  match 
his  own  when  presented  to  a  biometric  reader  in  conjunction  with  a  TWIC.  In 
addition,  an  individual  interested  in  ‘‘stealing’’  a  fingerprint  would  meet  much 
less  technical  resistance  and  obtain  a  more  accurate  representation  by  lifting 
it from an object in a public place such as a car door, window or drinking glass. 
B.  Operational  Considerations—There  are  several  concerns  with  encrypting  the 
fingerprint  template.  First,  every  transaction  will  require  encryption  and 
decryption,  each  of  which  affords  time  and  opportunity  for  a  problem  to  arise. 
In  addition,  prior  to  encryption  and  decryption,  some  form  of  authentication  or 
‘‘handshake’’  between  the  card  and  reader  is  necessary  to  validate  that  the 
transaction  about  to  take  place  is  legitimate.  In  order  for  such  authentication 
to  take  place,  some  form  of  key  management  must  be  in  place.  Thus,  if  a  key 
is compromised at one instance, it affects every reader in that ‘‘key community.’’ 

fore more difficult to develop, use, manage, and maintain. 

In summary: 
• Adding  encryption  generally  makes  the  TWIC  system  more  complex  and  there-
• Adding  encryption  will  slow  processing  time  to  read  cards  at  vessels/facilities. 
• The use of keys places an administrative burden and certain liabilities (e.g., re-
sponsibility  to  ensure  the  key  is  not  compromised)  on  those  charged  with  key 
management.  Vessel  and  facility  operators  are  neither  prepared  nor  able  to  ac-
cept these responsibilities. 

• Adding encryption will increase TWIC costs. 

Therefore  . . .  ‘‘Given  the  limited  amount  of  information  transmitted  between 
the  TWIC  and  the  reader,  the  Working  Group  does  not  believe  encryption  will 
provide  any  additional  security  benefit,  but  it  will  increase  both  cost  and  proc-
essing  time.’’  The  NMSAC  TWIC  Working  Group  (TWG)  closely  studied  the 
issue  and  as  a  group  concluded  that  the  operational  complexities  increase  by  a 
level  of  magnitude  and  to  the  point  where  they  are  not  proportionate  with  any 
perceived benefit of encrypting the biometric template. In short, there is no em-
pirical  evidence  that  encrypting  the  fingerprint  template  affords  any  additional 
protection of personal privacy. 

DHS  published  the  NMSAC  recommendations  for  public  comment,  approximately 
30  organizations  or  individuals  responded,  and  an  overwhelming  majority  agreed 
with the NMSAC on this critical issue. 

While it is possible that a compromise solution to this challenge may be identified, 
the  NMSAC  group  was  unable  to  explore  these  opportunities  given  the  fact  that 
DHS  did  not  provide  any  indication  that  it  would  expressly  require  encryption  of 
the biometric until February, after the maritime team had completed its work. Fur-
ther,  DHS  has  not  effectively  presented  rationale  for  taking  this  position;  indeed, 
the  original  task  statement  presented  by  DHS  stated  that  the  recommendations 
shall  incorporate  ‘‘reasonable  security  and  privacy  controls,’’  which  we  believe  the 
NMSAC-endorsed recommendations did. 

There  are  several  other  outstanding  questions  and  concerns  surrounding  the  se-
lection  and  use  of  card  reader  technology.  These  include  the  use  of  a  PIN  during 
the  TWIC  verification  procedures,  integration  with  legacy  access  control  systems, 
and  future  expansion  of  the  card.  However,  we  believe  DHS  will  work  effectively

with  the  pilot  program  participants  and  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory 
Committee  to  meet  the  challenges  associated  with  this  phase  of  the  rulemaking 
process. 

In  addition  to  addressing  the  above,  we  suggest  that  DHS  reverse  its  approach 
to  the  TWIC  reader  implementation.  Specifically,  rather  than  first  developing  a 
TWIC  reader  specification  and  subsequently  finalizing  policy  decisions  and  promul-
gating  a  rulemaking  on  reader  usage,  we  recommend  that  DHS  first  resolve  the 
TWIC policy questions (e.g., the requirement for use of readers at low-risk facilities 
and  vessels,  processes  for  enrolling  individuals  whose  fingerprint  cannot  be  cap-
tured,  access  recordkeeping,  etc.),  and  then  incorporate  the  appropriate  technology 
to support them. 

Finally,  we  suggest  that  DHS  work  with  industry  in  the  pilot  program  design 

phase as well as its evaluation and subsequent rulemaking activities. 
Conclusion 

Over the years, the maritime sector perhaps more than any other has recognized 
the need to implement new programs and practices in an effort to enhance the secu-
rity  of  our  homeland.  We  have  dramatically  altered  business  processes  and  worked 
closely with DHS agencies to help them achieve their missions. As with many Fed-
eral programs, we want to continue to work with TSA on the TWIC program to en-
sure  there  are  no  unintended  consequences,  such  as  those  which  might  arise  if  we 
are  unable  to  credential  casual  labor,  and  that  the  TWIC  will  be  deployed  in  the 
safest, most secure, and efficient manner possible. 

Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I will be happy to answer any ques-

tions you may have. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Paul Pomaikai, we welcome you. 

STATEMENT OF CAPT. PAUL KAIPO POMAIKAI, SR., 

ASSISTANT PORT CAPTAIN, SAUSE BROS.; ON BEHALF OF 

THE AMERICAN WATERWAYS OPERATORS 

Mr.  POMAIKAI.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  members  of 
the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and 
for the support you have shown the industry. 

My  name  is  Paul  K.  Pomaikai,  Senior,  I  am  the  Assistant  Port 

Captain—— 

Senator  CARPER.  Excuse  me,  would  you  pronounce  your  name 

again, your last name, very slowly? 

Mr. POMAIKAI. Pomaikai. 
Senator CARPER. Pomaikai. 
Mr. POMAIKAI. Pomaikai. 
Senator CARPER. Thank you, sir. 
Mr.  POMAIKAI.  Yes.  I’m  Assistant  Port  Captain  for  Sause  Broth-
ers,  I  also  hold  a  Master’s  Ticket  from  the  United  States  Coast 
Guard, going on my seventh issue. 

We’ve come out of Honolulu, Hawaii. Sause Brothers has been in 
marine  transportation  business  since  1937.  Our  Hawaiian  Island 
division was incorporated in 1983. 

I am testifying today on behalf of the American Waterways Oper-
ators,  the  national  trade  association  for  the  tugboat,  towboat  and 
barge industry. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Sause  Brothers  and  other  members  of  AWO  con-
sider  ourselves  partners  with  Congress,  and  the  Department  of 
Homeland  Security  in  ensuring  the  security  of  our  country.  We 
take that responsibility very seriously. 

We  are  here  today  because  we  have  serious  concerns  about  the 
impact  of  TWIC  and  the  TWIC  Program  on  our  industry  and  the 
men and women who work in it.

These issues are very personal for me, I grew up in the maritime 
industry.  My  father  was  on  the  dock  at  Pearl  Harbor  on  that  fate-
ful day, December 7, 1941. 

My wife, Donna Laurie, is also a licensed mariner, sailing in the 
engine  room  department  on  the  container  vessel  LURLINE,  of 
Matson  Navigation  Company,  as  we  speak.  In  2003,  Donna  and  I 
founded the Wai’anae Maritime Academy, located at Leeward Com-
munity College, a unit of the University of Hawaii. 

Our  intention  was  to  provide  young  people  with  the  education 
and training to begin a career in the maritime industry. So far, we 
have graduated 180 cadets in 9 classes. 

I  love  this  industry,  and  I  know  what  a  wonderful  place  it  can 
be to make a career. I do not want to see my industry or the people 
who  work  in  it  harmed  by  well-intentioned,  but  misguided  govern-
ment regulations. 

Mr. Chairman, AWO has two major concerns with the TWIC Pro-
gram.  First,  we  are  concerned  that  the  process  for  obtaining  a 
TWIC will become a barrier to entry that will discourage new hires 
from  beginning  a  career  in  the  maritime  industry.  This  will  com-
pound the existing shortage of personnel for our vessels. 

Second,  we  believe  requiring  card  readers  on  small  vessels  like 
towing  vessels  will  add  no  practical  security  value  and  should  not 
be  a  part  of  the  proposed  rule  that  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  will 
issue later this year. 

Let  me  elaborate  on  these  concerns,  briefly.  First,  AWO  is  very 
grateful  that  the  SAFE  Port  Act  passed  by  Congress  last  year  in-
cluded  a  provision  requiring  an  interim  work  authority  for  new 
hires.  However,  under  the  process  laid  out  in  the  TWIC  final  rule, 
an  individual  cannot  begin  working  under  the  new  hire  provision, 
until  he  or  she  has  traveled  to  a  TWIC  enrollment  center,  which 
could be many hours away, and for some of us in Hawaii, an island 
away, make an application for TWIC and pay the $137 fee. 

This  is  an  enormous  hurdle  for  a  young  man  or  woman  or  an 
older worker, looking to make a career change. It is also a problem 
for employers who need to be able to put new hires to work as soon 
as they have passed the drug screen and physicals. 

If  new  employees  are  scared  away  from  seeking  employment  in 
the maritime industry because of the burdens involved in applying 
for  a  TWIC,  companies  could  be  forced  to  tie  up  boats  for  lack  of 
crew  members  to  operate  them.  Given  the  importance  of  maritime 
transportation  to  the  economy  of  Hawaii,  and  other  states,  this 
would be a very major problem. 

As  an  alternative,  we  would  propose  that  the  process  begin  with 
a  computerized  check  against  a  terrorist  watch  list,  not  a  trip  to 
the  TWIC  enrollment  center,  with  an  employees  consent,  the  em-
ployer could enter his or her name, birth date, Social Security num-
ber  into  the  Coast  Guard’s  Homeport  website,  to  initiate  a  check 
against a terrorist watch list. 

Provided  this  initial  screening  turned  up  no  red  flags,  the  indi-
vidual  could  be  put  to  work  on  an  interim  basis.  Later,  once  the 
new  hire  has  had  the  taste  of  life  and  work  on  a  vessel  and  sees 
that  it  will  work  for  him  or  her,  the  mariner  could  be  required  to 
complete the TWIC enrollment process.

Second,  AWO  believes  that  the  card  readers  should  not  be  re-
quired  on  vessels  with  small  crews,  like  towing  vessels.  The  SAFE 
Port Act gives the Department of Homeland Security the authority 
to  limit  the  card  reader  requirement  to  vessels  with  more  than  a 
certain number of crew, to be determined by that agency. 

On  a  typical  U.S.  flag-towing  vessel  with  four  to  ten  crew  mem-
bers,  all  of  whom  are  familiar  to  management  and  fellow  crew 
members,  an  electronic  card  reader  adds  no  practical  security 
value.  We  strongly  recommend  that  card  readers  not  be  required 
on vessels with less than 10 crew members. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to tes-

tify. 

[The prepared statement of Captain Pomaikai follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CAPT. PAUL KAIPO POMAIKAI, SR., ASSISTANT PORT 
CAPTAIN, SAUSE BROS.; ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN WATERWAYS OPERATORS 
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, I am Paul Kaipo Pomaikai, Sr., Assistant Port Cap-
tain for Sause Bros., Inc., in Honolulu, Hawaii. I want to thank you for holding this 
hearing and for the support you have shown for our industry. 

Sause  Bros.,  headquartered  in  Coos  Bay,  Oregon,  is  a  privately  held  towing  com-
pany, carrying forest products, building materials and petroleum to and from Alaska 
and Hawaii and up and down the U.S. West Coast. We employ over 500 people, in-
cluding  300  mariners  as  crew  on  our  boats.  Sause  Bros.  owns  and  operates  a  fleet 
of  35  tugboats  and  25  barges,  and  has  been  in  the  marine  transportation  business 
since 1937. 

Sause Bros. has been engaged in common carrier service to the Hawaiian Islands 
since  1966.  Our  Hawaiian  Island  division  was  incorporated  in  Hawaii  in  1983  to 
more  effectively  serve  Island  customers.  The  Hawaiian  fleet  provides  inter-island 
and  Military  Sealift  Command  towing  services,  and  distributes  West  Coast  cargoes 
to  Island  customers.  Our  Island  barge  fleet  carries  products  ranging  from  lumber, 
plywood,  sand,  and  containers,  to  heavy  equipment  and  petroleum  products.  Our 
ship  assist  fleet  has  gained  a  reputation  among  the  Island  shipping  industry  for 
safety, reliability, and professionalism. 

As  Assistant  Port  Captain  for  Sause  Bros.,  I  am  responsible  for  all  of  our  oper-
ations  in  the  Hawaiian  Islands.  In  addition,  in  2003,  my  wife,  Donna  Laurie,  who 
is  also  a  licensed  mariner,  and  I  founded  the  Wai’anae  Maritime  Academy,  located 
at  Leeward  Community  College  at  Wai’anae,  a  unit  of  the  University  of  Hawaii,  to 
provide young people with the education necessary to begin a career in the maritime 
industry.  We  have  graduated  180  cadets  in  nine  classes,  and  this  May  we  will  be 
holding  our  tenth  class.  One  of  our  commitments  to  our  students  is  to  help  them 
find employment on board vessels following their graduation. We help them to meet 
the qualifications and get the documents they need, and we also help them develop 
the lifestyle that allows them to be productive workers in the maritime industry or 
other places they may decide to go with their lives. 

I am appearing before the Committee today on behalf of The American Waterways 
Operators.  AWO  is  the  national  trade  association  for  the  tugboat,  towboat,  and 
barge  industry.  The  industry  AWO  represents  is  the  largest  segment  of  the  U.S.- 
flag domestic fleet and a vital part of America’s transportation system. The industry 
safely  and  efficiently  moves  over  800  million  tons  of  cargo  each  year  with  a  fleet 
that  consists  of  nearly  4,000  tugboats  and  towboats,  and  over  27,000  barges.  Our 
industry employs more than 30,000 mariners as crewmembers on our vessels. While 
a  few  companies  in  the  towing  industry  are  relatively  large,  according  to  the  U.S. 
Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  over  90  percent  of  U.S.  towing  companies  are  actually 
smaller than Sause Bros. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Sause  Bros.  and  the  other  members  of  The  American  Waterways 
Operators  have  been,  and  will  continue  to  be,  partners  with  Congress  and  the  De-
partment of Homeland Security in ensuring the security of our country. Immediately 
after  the  September  11,  2001  attacks,  the  members  of  AWO  worked  in  cooperation 
with  the  Coast  Guard  to  develop  security  plans  for  our  vessels,  even  before  they 
were  required  by  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  of  2002.  We  take  secu-
rity seriously, and we are proud of the fact that our vessels and their crews are con-
sidered  to  be  the  ‘‘eyes  and  ears’’  for  the  Coast  Guard  on  our  Nation’s  waterways.

Nevertheless,  we  have  serious  concerns  about  the  impact  of  the  Transportation 
Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program on our industry and the men and 
women  who  work  in  it.  Our  primary  concern  is  that  the  process  for  obtaining  a 
TWIC card will become a barrier to entry into the maritime industry for new hires, 
and  this  will  exacerbate  an  existing  shortage  of  personnel  for  our  vessels.  We  are 
also  concerned  that  requiring  card  readers  on  small  vessels  like  towing  vessels  will 
add no practical security value and should not be part of the proposed rule that TSA 
and the Coast Guard will issue later this year. Allow me to elaborate on these con-
cerns. 

The  May  2006  NPRM  contemplated  a  TWIC  enrollment  process  taking  30  to  60 
days. In its comments on the NPRM, AWO said that such a time-frame would ‘‘seri-
ously  impede  the  ability  of  companies  to  bring  new  mariners  into  the  industry  in 
a timely manner.’’ AWO and many of the 2,000 other organizations and individuals 
commenting on the NPRM suggested that the Department of Homeland Security in-
clude  an  interim  work  authority  provision  in  the  TWIC  rule  which  would  enable 
new  hires  in  the  industry  to  begin  working  immediately  once  they  have  passed  an 
initial security screening. 

We  are  enormously  grateful  that  the  Congress  recognized  these  concerns,  and  as 
a result, a provision of the SAFE Port Act, Public Law 109–347, signed into law on 
October  13,  2006,  required  the  inclusion  of  an  interim  work  authority  in  the  final 
rule.  The  statute  provides:  ‘‘The  regulations  shall  include  a  background  check  proc-
ess  to  enable  newly  hired  workers  to  begin  working  unless  the  Secretary  makes  an 
initial  determination  that  the  worker  poses  a  security  risk.  Such  process  shall  in-
clude  a  check  against  the  consolidated  and  integrated  terrorist  watch  list  main-
tained  by  the  Federal  Government.’’  This  language  embodied  the  request  we  had 
made  in  our  comments  to  the  NPRM  and  made  mandatory  a  process  to  allow  new 
hires to begin working after an initial screening unless there is a determination that 
the worker poses a security risk (emphasis added). 

The  final  rule  issued  on  January  25,  however,  does  not  follow  the  intent  of  the 
statute  to  avoid  creating  barriers  to  new  hires  entering  the  industry.  The  proposal 
would  deny  a  new  hire  the  ability  to  begin  work  until  the  expensive  and  burden-
some  application  process  for  a  TWIC  has  been  completed.  Under  the  process  called 
for  in  the  final  rule,  new  applicants  must  first  travel  to  a  TWIC  enrollment  center 
to make application for a TWIC in person, as well as pay the TWIC enrollment fee 
of $137, before undergoing an initial check against the terrorist watch list. 

For  many  applicants  in  Hawaii  and  other  parts  of  the  country,  this  trip  to  the 
TWIC enrollment center will not be quick, easy or inexpensive. In Hawaii, for exam-
ple,  an  applicant  might  have  to  fly  from  one  island  to  another  simply  to  apply  for 
a TWIC. In other parts of the country where there is not a TWIC enrollment center 
nearby, applicants will also have to travel significant distances in order to make the 
application.  This  process  creates  a  very  high  barrier  to  entry  for  new  entrants  to 
the  industry  who  are  not  sure  whether  a  career  in  the  maritime  industry  is  right 
for them. 

Under the final rule, the ‘‘initial’’ security screening can only occur after the appli-
cant  has  gone  through  the  time  and  expense  of  completing  his  or  her  application. 
At  that  point,  the  employer  may  enter  the  individual’s  information  into  the  Coast 
Guard’s  Homeport  website  to  obtain  the  results  of  the  check  against  the  terrorist 
watch list. The rule indicates that a response can be expected within 24 to 72 hours 
after  enrollment  is  completed.  The  problem  is  that  for  new  hires  and  their  employ-
ers,  the  TWIC  enrollment  process  is  only  one  step  in  a  larger  process  of  coming  to 
work  in  the  maritime  industry.  The  first  thing  a  company  does  when  a  new  hire 
makes application is put him or her through a drug screen. If he or she passes that 
test,  the  next  step  is  a  physical  exam,  followed  by  a  reference  check.  In  the  real 
world, neither the applicant nor an employer will want to invest in a trip to a TWIC 
enrollment center until those steps are taken. What that means is that it could eas-
ily  take  more  than  a  week  before  an  applicant  is  ready  to  travel  to  an  enrollment 
center  and  make  application  for  a  TWIC,  and  then  wait  an  additional  3  days  for 
the results of the terrorist watch list check to be available. 

Mr.  Chairman,  we  are  concerned  that  requiring  new  applicants  to  undergo  such 
a  burdensome  process  will  deter  individuals  from  entering  the  maritime  industry. 
My  company,  and  companies  like  mine,  provide  entry  level  opportunities  for  high 
school  graduates  looking  to  begin  a  career  in  the  marine  industry  as  deckhands  on 
our vessels. These men and women come to our company with a need to begin earn-
ing  a  paycheck  and  providing  for  themselves  and  their  families  right  away.  Faced 
with  the  burdensome  requirements  surrounding  the  TWIC  process,  many  will  seek 
employment  in  another  industry  where  the  barriers  to  entry  are  not  so  high.  Even 
without  the  TWIC  rule,  we  are  struggling  with  a  chronic  shortage  of  personnel  to 
man  our  vessels.  AWO  estimates  that  the  annual  turnover  of  entry  level  personnel

in  the  towing  industry  is  50  percent.  New  hires  may  find  that  they  get  seasick  or 
homesick  and  choose  not  to  continue  with  a  maritime  career.  Companies  must  also 
evaluate  an  individual’s  ability  to  perform  on  the  job.  Both  the  new  hire  and  the 
company  must  come  to  the  conclusion  that  a  career  as  a  working  mariner  is  the 
right  ‘‘fit’’  for  the  individual  and  the  company  before  a  long  term  commitment  is 
made.  For  many  new  hires,  the  first  manifestation  of  that  commitment  is  the  trip 
to  the  TWIC  enrollment  center  and  the  payment  of  the  application  fee.  That  com-
mitment should not be required until both the company and the applicant have con-
cluded that the individual will continue in the industry. 

In this environment, we are very concerned that the burdensome requirements for 
obtaining  a  TWIC  card  will  exacerbate  the  current  personnel  shortage  and  could 
even  force  companies  like  ours  to  tie  up  boats  for  lack  of  crewmembers  to  operate 
them. Such an outcome would have a very negative impact on our ability to deliver 
the cargoes that are the building blocks of the economy in Hawaii, and would have 
the  same  negative  impact  on  the  national  economy  by  affecting  hundreds  of  towing 
companies around the country that also deliver the goods that are essential to main-
tain America’s economic vitality. 

As  an  alternative,  we  would  propose  that  the  process  begin  with  a  computerized 
check  against  the  terrorist  watch  list,  not  a  trip  to  the  TWIC  enrollment  center. 
(This  could  be  done  concurrently  with  the  drug  screen  or  physical  exam  described 
earlier.) With an employee’s consent, the employer could enter the new hire’s name, 
birth date, and Social Security number into the Coast Guard’s Homeport website to 
initiate  a  check  against  the  terrorist  watch  list.  Provided  this  initial  screening 
turned up no red flags, the individual could be put to work on a vessel on an interim 
basis.  Later—once  the  new  hire  has  a  taste  of  life  and  work  on  a  vessel,  and  sees 
that  it  works  for  him  or  her—the  mariner  could  be  required  to  complete  the  TWIC 
enrollment process. 

Another  significant  concern  for  the  towing  industry  is  the  potential  requirement 
for TWIC card ‘‘readers’’ on every towing vessel. The NPRM proposed a requirement 
for  readers  at  both  facilities  and  vessels.  The  Department  subsequently  announced 
that  the  card  reader  requirement  would  not  be  implemented  as  part  of  the  initial 
TWIC  rule  but  would  be  considered  further  as  part  of  a  separate  rulemaking.  This 
was  a  proper  response  to  the  many  comments  that  were  received  about  the  card 
reader  requirement,  but  the  issue  of  card  readers  for  towing  vessels  remains  an 
open one. 

Card  readers  are  simply  unnecessary  for  towing  vessels.  As  AWO  pointed  out  in 
its  comments  on  the  NPRM,  crew  sizes  on  tugboats  and  towboats  typically  range 
from  four  to  ten  mariners.  In  a  typical  U.S.-flagged  towing  vessel  operation,  every 
employee  is  known  to  management  and  fellow  crewmembers.  A  stranger  onboard 
the vessel is immediately obvious. Personal knowledge of fellow employees provides 
a  higher  security  standard  than  reliance  upon  an  electronic  reader,  no  matter  how 
sophisticated the technology employed. Access control procedures can be included as 
part  of  a  vessel  security  plan.  The  validity  of  TWIC  cards  can  be  checked  through 
means  other  than  mandating  computerized  equipment  onboard  each  vessel  to  con-
stantly communicate with the database. 

Mr.  Chairman,  even  if  card  readers  could  be  operated  reliably  in  the  severe  ma-
rine  environments  where  towing  vessels  routinely  go—and  that  has  not  yet  been 
demonstrated—there is simply no need to require their installation on every towing 
vessel  in  order  to  ensure  the  security  of  those  vessels,  or  to  ensure  the  security  of 
the  maritime  transportation  system.  The  SAFE  Port  Act  gives  DHS  the  authority 
to  limit  the  card  reader  requirement  to  vessels  with  more  than  a  certain  number 
of crew, to be determined by the agency. On behalf of AWO, I would like to suggest 
that,  at  a  minimum,  vessels  with  10  or  fewer  crew  members  requiring  a  TWIC 
should not be required to have a card reader installed onboard. 

These  problems  with  the  TWIC  program  are  very  significant,  especially  for  the 
many  small  businesses  in  the  towing  industry.  They  also  have  serious  implications 
for  companies  throughout  the  towing  industry  and  for  the  economy  we  serve.  The 
provision  for  an  interim  work  authority  for  new  hires  into  the  industry  must  be  a 
workable  one.  The  requirement  to  begin  the  process  by  traveling  to  a  TWIC  enroll-
ment  center  must  be  eliminated.  Failure  to  do  so  will  have  a  significant  negative 
impact  on  the  ability  of  vessel  operators  to  attract  and  retain  the  individuals  nec-
essary  to  crew  their  boats.  In  addition,  card  readers  provide  no  additional  security 
value in a small vessel environment and should not be required for vessels with ten 
or fewer crewmembers. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  very  much  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you 
today.  AWO  and  its  member  companies  stand  ready  to  work  with  this  committee 
and  with  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  to  ensure  the  security  of  our  country  while

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. RODRIGUEZ, EXECUTIVE 

ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL 

ORGANIZATION OF MASTERS, MATES AND PILOTS, AFL–CIO 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you. 
I have submitted written testimony to the Committee. I’d like to 

read a brief statement to highlight a couple of points. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  I  would  point  out,  Mr.  Rodriguez,  thanks 
for the reminder, that your full statements will be in the record as 
written,  and  that  the  summary—we  hope—covered  the  points  you 
wanted  to  make.  But,  be  assured  that  your  full  statement  will  be 
in the record. 

Please, Mr. Rodriguez, start. 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  am  Michael  Rodriguez,  Executive  Assistant  to  the  President  of 
the  International  Organization  of  Masters,  Mates  and  Pilots.  I 
began  my  career  in  the  maritime  industry  in  1979  as  a  graduate 
of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at King’s Point. 

I sailed as a Deck Officer aboard U.S.-flag vessels until 1995. At 
MMP,  I  report  on  regulatory  matters  to  the  organization’s  leader-
ship.  I  have  been  monitoring  the  development  of  the  TWIC  Pro-
gram since the beginning. 

I  am  also  a  Lieutenant  Commander  in  the  United  States  Naval 
Reserve,  and  a  Veteran  of  Operation  Enduring  Freedom.  I’ll  touch 
on a couple of points that are in my written statement. 

The TWIC Program must be a national program. We believe Con-
gress  envisioned  a  national  maritime  security  system  that  would 
pre-empt  state  and  local  systems.  However,  current  provisions 
allow state or local governments to impose their own duplicate sys-
tems.  This  will  result  in  higher  costs  and  additional  burdens  for 
our  workers  and  vessel  operators  as  they  trade  between  States, 
even  between  facilities,  within  the  same  state.  We  are  also  con-
cerned about processing delays at the state and local levels. 

The TWIC Program should be compatible with international sys-
tems. We have argued that the TWIC Program should take advan-
tage of proven biometric technology by using the International Civil 
Aviation  Organization  standards.  The  ICAO  standards  are  simple, 
efficient, and recognized worldwide. 

Machine-readable  travel  document  control  systems  used  by  the 
United States for electronic passports that monitor entry of foreign 
travelers  into  the  United  States  employ  the  ICAO  standard.  We 
feel the ICAO standard is the logical choice for a biometric security 
card that could be interoperable with the TWIC and the Seafarer’s 
Identity  Documents  that  will  be  carried  by  crews  of  foreign  ships 
trading to the U.S. 

Finally,  we  are  concerned  about  the  administrative  law  judge 
program that would be put in place to handle denials and waivers.

We  feel  it  is  imperative  that  a  sufficient  number  of  ALJs  be  in 
place  to  handle  the  increased  case  load  generated  by  the  TWIC.  If 
reviews are not processed in a timely manner, there will be a sub-
stantial  negative  impact  on  workers  who  are  wrongly  denied  their 
TWICs. 

That  concludes  my  remarks,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  look  forward  to 

your questions. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Rodriguez follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J.  RODRIGUEZ,  EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT TO THE 
PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF MASTERS, MATES AND PILOTS, AFL– 
CIO 
I want to thank the Committee for inviting the Masters, Mates & Pilots (MM&P) 
to  present  our  views  concerning  the  implementation  of  the  Transportation  Worker 
Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  in  the  maritime  sector.  Our  organization  rep-
resents  Ship’s  Masters  and  Licensed  Deck  Officers  and  Engineers  working  aboard 
U.S.-flag commercial vessels operating in the international and domestic trades, and 
on the inland waterways; and on civilian-crewed ships in the government fleet. The 
MM&P also represents harbor pilots. 

The  MM&P  and,  in  fact,  all  the  American  seafaring  and  longshore  unions,  have 
a vital interest in maritime security and the administration of the maritime security 
regime.  The  members  of  our  maritime  labor  organizations  will  be  directly  affected 
by any breach of maritime security. Many of the members of the MM&P also serve 
as  Ship  Security  Officers  and  are  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  U.S. 
Maritime Security Regulations and the International Code for the Security of Ships 
and of Port Facilities (ISPS Code). 

Our comments are from the perspective of mariners who are continually in transit 
between  different  terminals,  ports,  states  and  countries  for  long  periods  as  they 
work  and  live  aboard  their  vessels.  Accordingly,  and  in  order  to  do  their  jobs  effi-
ciently  and  effectively,  these  maritime  workers  need  consistency  between  national 
and  international  identity  credentials,  and  uniformity  with  respect  to  the  adminis-
tration of access control. 

Once  fully  implemented  across  all  sectors  of  the  transportation  industry,  the 
TWIC  program  will  affect  millions  of  American  workers.  In  fact,  many  of  our  con-
cerns are shared by other transportation workers, such as longshoremen, truck driv-
ers,  rail  crews,  ship  service  personnel  and  others  whose  employment  is  not  limited 
to a single facility or port. 

Seafaring and longshore workers want secure ports and vessels. We should be and 
we want to be treated as allies in the war against terror and not as the enemy. Our 
members would be among the first affected by a terrorist attack directed at or using 
our Nation’s maritime transportation system. Therefore, we understand that access 
control  procedures,  including  identification  cards,  can  be  important  tools  in  the  ef-
fort  to  prevent  terrorist  acts  against  our  maritime  transportation  system.  We  sup-
port initiatives to identify and bar from working in security-sensitive transportation 
jobs individuals who clearly pose a security risk. 

The stated goals of the TWIC program are to improve the security of our transpor-
tation  systems,  ensure  the  flow  of  commerce,  and  preserve  the  rights  of  workers; 
workers  who  are  essential  participants  in  the  supply  chain  and  in  its  security.  We 
believe very strongly that in order to achieve these objectives, the process of apply-
ing  for  and  receiving  a  TWIC  must  be  efficient  and  must  not  result  in  unnecessary 
burdens  upon  workers.  TWIC  cards  will  be  used  in  a  marine  environment  covering 
a  vast  and  diverse  maritime  workplace  and  the  program  must  not  only  account  for 
and  reflect  this  reality,  but  must  be  adaptable  to  a  wide  variety  of  circumstances. 
Unfortunately,  we  are  concerned  that  in  too  many  areas  this  is  not  currently  the 
case. 
An Overview of the Current Situation 
Support for a National Program 

We  have  no  doubt  of  the  need  for  a  ‘‘biometric  transportation  security  card’’  as 
mandated by Congress in section 70105 of the Maritime Transportation Security Act 
of 2002 (MTSA of 2002). Early on we saw the benefits of a single, national security 
system based on a comprehensive security record check that could be used in a uni-
form  system  by  a  mobile  workforce  employed  across  many  terminals,  ports  and 
states.  Therefore,  we  support  a  system  based  upon  background  checks  to  ensure 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

49 

that  transportation  workers  do  not  pose  a  ‘‘terrorism  security  risk’’  to  the  United 
States. However, our support was predicated on the belief that such a system would 
be  a  national  system  that  would  become  the  standard  for  all  maritime  workers 
throughout  the  country  and  would  prevent  a  proliferation  of  local  systems  that 
would  all  require  their  own  background  checks  and  fees.  This  unfortunately  is  not 
the  case  today.  In  the  absence  of  Federal  preemption,  the  program  is  permitting 
local requirements to overlay the TWIC standards for access control. 

It  should  be  clear  that  this  situation  is  inconsistent  with  the  goals  of  the  TWIC 
program  and  unnecessarily  burdens  transportation  workers  who,  by  the  nature  of 
their  work,  require  access  to  secure  areas  throughout  a  port,  a  state,  the  Nation, 
or even internationally. Terrorism and the prevention of terrorism are national, not 
local, concerns and the standards and system put in place to address these national 
concerns  should  take  precedence  over  all  others  and  not  be  left  to  the  vagaries  of 
each individual facility, port, city or state. 
Need for International Uniformity 

We  anticipated  and  have  urged  that  the  TWIC  program  should  take  advantage 
of  proven  biometric  technology  by  using  standards  developed  by  the  International 
Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO).  ICAO  is  the  United  Nations  organization  that 
regulates  international  air  transport.  The  ICAO  standards  are  simple,  efficient, 
widely used and recognized worldwide. 

In addition, the ICAO standards form the basis for secure identity documents re-
cently  adopted  by  the  International  Labor  Organization  in  Convention  185  (ILO 
C185), Seafarer Identity Documents (SID). They also form the basis for the machine 
readable  travel  document  control  systems  used  by  the  U.S.  for  electronic  passports 
that  monitor  access  of  foreign  travelers  to  the  U.S.  It  seems  to  us  the  ICAO  stand-
ards  are  the  logical  choice  for  a  biometric  security  card  that  could  be  used  in  an 
interoperable  system  that  could  include  both  our  national  cards  and  the  inter-
national cards that will be carried by the crews of foreign ships; a population of sea-
faring  workers  employed  aboard  the  foreign  flag  ships  that  carry  95  percent  of 
America’s  export  and  import  trade  in  and  out  of  America’s  ports.  Also,  foreign  port 
workers  on  U.S.  flag  ships  while  working  cargo  or  undergoing  repairs  in  foreign 
ports are expected to carry ICAO-compatible identity cards. 

Because  our  TWIC  system  will  not  be  interoperable  with  international  standards 
the  vast  majority  of  ships  and  crews  in  U.S.  deepwater  ports  will  not  be  covered 
under TWIC-based access control systems. In other words, U.S. ships working cargo 
in  a  U.S.  port  with  U.S.  labor  will  have  to  comply  with  United  States  Coast  Guard 
(Coast Guard) security provisions while a competing foreign ship with a foreign crew 
at the same terminal will be exempt—a situation we can begin to rectify by requir-
ing that the TWIC system use the readily available ICAO standards. 
An Overly Complex Card 

It  is  disappointing  to  us  that  the  very  clear  provisions  regarding  security  cards 
in  the  MTSA  of  2002  have  still  not  been  fully  implemented  in  2007.  We  attribute 
this to a number of factors. 

First,  ownership  of  the  program  has  been  split.  Responsibility  for  the  design  of 
the card lies with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) while the Coast 
Guard is responsible for implementation of access control programs using the TWIC. 
Second,  rather  than  accepting  the  proven  ICAO  standard,  the  TSA  has  adopted 
a design standard that is technologically sophisticated but overly complex and with 
a  functionality  that  is,  in  most  cases,  far  beyond  that  needed  to  comply  with  the 
MTSA of 2002. 

Third,  the  card  design  standard  and  required  supporting  equipment  is  unproven 
in  the  maritime  environment.  Many  individuals  and  organizations  experienced  in 
maritime  transportation  believe  that  the  complex  access  control  regime  it  is  in-
tended to support is both unnecessary and impractical throughout much of the mari-
time workplace. 

Many  have  also  raised  objections  over  the  approach  taken  by  the  TSA  but,  from 
our perspective, the agenda seems to be dictated by the concerns of the card manu-
facturers and contractors rather than by those of the affected population in the mar-
itime  industry  who  will  be  covered  by  the  program.  The  result  is  a  very  complex 
and  expensive  program  that  we  are  concerned  will  cause  major  disruptions  in  the 
maritime  transportation  system  if  implemented  as  proposed.  The  cost  for  all  this 
will have been borne by the workers in the system. 
Leads to Overly Complex Control System 

In  May  2006,  the  Coast  Guard  issued  a  proposal  for  a  security  regime  governing 
access  control  using  the  full  functionality  of  the  proposed  card.  That  proposal  met 
strenuous  objections  from  the  maritime  industry  which  highlighted  the  proposed 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

50 

card’s  impracticality.  It  appeared  that  the  initial  proposal  was  driven  by  a  desire 
on  the  part  of  the  Coast  Guard  to  utilize  the  full  alleged  functionality  of  the  TSA- 
designed card across the entire maritime sector regardless of any risk-based assess-
ment  of  the  threat  of  terrorism  in  the  various  sectors  of  a  very  diverse  industry. 
As  an  example,  vessels  would  be  required  to  have  onboard  card  readers  inter-
connected  via  satellite  communications  to  a  central  server  maintained  by  the  TSA 
to  monitor  use  of  the  TWIC  card.  The  impracticality  of  applying  such  a  system  to 
thousands  of  small  inland  towing  vessels  or  offshore  supply  vessels,  or  even  large 
ocean-going  ships,  should  be  self  evident.  While  the  initial  Coast  Guard  proposed 
access  control  provisions  have  been  withdrawn,  they  remain  the  subject  of  a  future 
rulemaking  that,  as  far  as  we  know,  still  has  the  objective  of  utilizing  the  full 
functionality  of  the  TWIC  card  across  the  entire  maritime  sector  in  a  one-size-fits- 
all approach to security. 

Security systems need to differentiate between high risk operations and low to no 
risk  operations.  Security  regimes  and  controls  must  be  scalable  to  the  risk.  For  in-
stance,  a  high  profile  cruise  ship  and  a  terminal  handling  thousands  of  passengers 
is  in  a  very  different  risk  category  or  tier  than  an  inland  towing  vessel  with  a  5 
person crew or a ship and terminal handling crushed rock or iron ore. 
Need for Federal Preemption 

Since  transportation  workers  will  be  required  to  carry  a  TWIC,  it  follows  that 
many  of  the  card  holders  will  travel  between  states,  ports,  and  facilities.  If  the 
TWIC regulations allow each state, port, or facility to develop its own unique access 
control system that does not conform to a uniform national standard then the TWIC 
program will impose tremendous costs upon the industry and its workforce but pro-
vide  no  real  value  in  terms  of  ensuring  the  free  flow  of  commerce.  The  imposition 
of  numerous  inconsistent  local  requirements  will  require  transportation  workers  to 
file  numerous  applications,  undergo  numerous  background  checks  and  pay  the  fees 
associated  with  all  of  the  perhaps  dozens  of  identity  cards  workers  would  have  to 
carry.  We  are  also  concerned  about  delays  in  the  various  systems  that  would  pos-
sibly deprive workers of employment while they wait for their cards. 

Such  a  system  clearly  places  an  unreasonable  burden  on  workers  and  on  inter-
state and foreign commerce. We strongly believe there is an urgent need for Federal 
laws  and  regulations  governing  the  TWIC  to  preempt  any  state  or  local  require-
ments for such workers. 
The TWIC Should Focus on Exposing Terrorism Security Risks 

In  the  MTSA  of  2002,  Congress  mandated  that  those  who  could  be  a  ‘‘terrorism 
security risk’’ to the United Stated should be denied a security card. We agree with 
that  standard  and  recognize  that  TSA  has  made  some  modifications  to  its  original 
list  of  disqualifying  crimes.  We  remain  concerned  that  some  of  the  broad  descrip-
tions  of  disqualifying  offenses  go  beyond  this  standard.  As  this  program  is  imple-
mented  over  the  next  few  months  and  years,  we  hope  that  TSA  will  indeed  focus 
on preventing those that are genuine security risks from holding a TWIC and exer-
cise  appropriate  discretion  to  not  deny  employment  opportunities  to  those  workers 
who may have simply made a mistake years ago. 
Need for an Adequate ALJ Program 

We are pleased that Congress has established a requirement for a review process 
before  an  administrative  law  judge  (ALJ)  for  individuals  denied  a  TWIC.  It  is  our 
understanding  that  the  present  intent  is  to  use  the  ALJ’s  within  the  Coast  Guard 
system.  We  recognize  the  merits  of  having  Coast  Guard  ALJ’s  conduct  the  reviews, 
but we have concerns as to the adequacy of the number of ALJ’s within the present 
Coast  Guard  system  to  handle  the  caseload  that  may  be  generated.  If  the  Coast 
Guard  is  not  able  to  process  reviews  in  a  timely  manner  it  will  have  a  substantial 
impact  on  the  ability  of  workers  who  may  have  been  wrongly  denied  a  TWIC,  to 
earn a living and support their families. 

Currently,  the  Coast  Guard’s  ALJ  system  handles  a  caseload  generated  by  ap-
proximately  200,000  credentialed  mariners.  It  has  been  estimated  that  the  initial 
surge into the TWIC program will cover approximately 850,000 workers. It is imper-
ative  that  a  sufficient  number  of  ALJ’s  are  in  place  to  handle  a  vastly  increased 
caseload. 
Cost of the TWIC Program 

We continue to oppose the concept that workers must pay the costs for the TWIC 
program. The security threat assessments and the background checks mandated by 
the final rule are considered necessary to enhance the security of our Nation’s ports 
and are part of the overall effort to fight terrorist elements.

Security  threats  against  ports  and  ships  are  actually  aimed  at  governments  and 
the  public  they  represent,  not  the  individual  worker.  Reducing  security  threats 
aimed  at  destabilizing  our  political  and  social  institutions  by  terrorizing  the  public 
is primarily a role of the government. The general public is the principle beneficiary 
of maintaining a secure maritime transportation system and a secure global supply 
chain. Therefore, while we understand and appreciate the fact that some employers 
are paying these costs, the Federal Government should fund this program. 
Privacy Concerns 

As transportation labor has consistently stated, maintaining the privacy and con-
fidentiality  of  the  information  collected  and  generated  by  the  TWIC  process  is  cru-
cial. Toward this end and at our request, Section 70105(e) of the MTSA of 2002 in-
cludes a specific mandate that ‘‘information obtained by the Attorney General or the 
Secretary under this section may not be made available to the public, including the 
individual’s  employer.’’  We  do  appreciate  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard’s  stated  intent 
to  fully  abide  by  these  privacy  protections,  but  continued  vigilance  will  be  needed 
to ensure that sensitive information collected in the field, especially at so-called mo-
bile enrollment centers, is adequately protected. 

We also have concerns over discussions at the agency level toward allowing facili-
ties to use the TWIC card for local applications. The idea is to store additional infor-
mation beyond what is required by the MTSA of 2002. Such local applications might 
include employment records, training records, medical records, or other information 
of a sensitive nature and would defeat the national character of the system. 

As a matter of privacy protection we strongly believe that the information on the 
TWIC should be limited to only that necessary for the Federal Government to com-
ply with the security functions specified in the MTSA of 2002. 
Conclusion 

We thank you, again, Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to present our comments 
on  the  implementation  of  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential.  We 
stand ready to work with you and your Committee and other concerned and affected 
parties to achieve a safer and more secure maritime transportation network. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much. 
And  thank  each  of  you  for  your  excellent  testimony.  It  helped 
focus  in  on  the  magnitude  of  this  problem,  and  the  consequences 
of what, if it is finally in place, what it might mean. So, it’s impor-
tant advice that you give us. 

Mr.  Rodriguez,  how  many  states  are  moving  forward  with  their 
own  security  credentialing  programs  in  the  absence  of  a  Federal 
system?  Have  states  begun  aggressively  to  try  to  establish  these 
identity systems? 

Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I’m aware of only Florida. That’s 
my own knowledge. I could try to find that information for you and 
provide it for the Committee at a later date. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  What  do  you  think  about  the  time  frames 
discussed  by  the  earlier,  in  the  earlier  panel  for  getting  this  pro-
gram  underway,  any  of  you  who  feel  that  you  have  knowledge 
about that, please feel free to speak up, Mr. Rodriguez? 

Mr. RODRIGUEZ. I feel that some of what Mr. Hawley’s testimony 
touched on, the functionality of the card, the ‘‘Cadillac’’ sort of fea-
tures  it  has,  is  holding  us  back  in  terms  of  getting  a  good  system 
that we can test in operation. 

What  I  mean  by  that  is,  we’re  talking  about  putting  a  lot  of 
functionality into this card, and that’s opening up the discussion to 
what we can put on the card? What sorts of information? Who gets 
to  write  to  the  card?  That’s  slowing  down  the  implementation.  So, 
that’s  one  of  the  reasons  we  would  like  to  see  the  international 
standard  adopted.  It’s  a  very  simple  standard,  and  once  we  get  a 
program  running,  our  recommendation  is  to  build  upon  that,  the 
capabilities that we need.

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Either  one  of  you  want  to  comment  on 
your view of the timeframe that has been discussed to getting this 
program really underway? 

Ms. HIMBER. I—perhaps naively so, but am remaining cautiously 
optimistic—we  do  think  that  there  is  some  momentum  going,  and 
we  appreciate  what  the  Secretary  said  about  making  sure  we  take 
the time now to make sure it works right, rather than rushing into 
it and dealing with problems later. 

The  experience  that  we’ve  had  with  the  pilot  program  is  that 
that is the wrong approach. So, we’re hopeful that once they do get 
started  it  will—the  timetable  that  they  ultimately  develop,  they’ll 
be  able  to  maintain,  because  they’ve  worked  out  problems  in  ad-
vance. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. So, your time frame is hopeful. 
OK, Mr. Pomaikai? 
Mr.  POMAIKAI.  Thank  you,  good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  again. 
We have no problem with the time frame. The time frame is not 
a  problem.  What  I  fear  is,  the  system  will  be  inundated  with  a 
massive  amount  of  people  all  at  one  time.  If  we  roll  the  program 
out  in  certain  areas  like  we  are  doing  now,  the  Coast  Guard  has 
to deal with all of the merchant mariners going through their docu-
ments,  going  through  background  checks,  probably  drawing  from 
the same database once the TWIC is implemented, they will again 
be swamped—and they’ll have to deal with that problem. 

Our  problem  is  to  be  able  to  get  new  hires  on  the  vessel  in  a 
timely  fashion.  They  have  to  provide  for  their  families,  they  have 
to  go  to  work.  They  do  so  after  a  process  of  application  with  our 
company,  and  the  process  of  obtaining  from  an  MMD  from  the 
Coast Guard, there’s a section there—section four of the application 
of the MMD—that calls for a background check. That process alone 
is  done  after  the  application  is  turned  in  to  the  Coast  Guard,  sent 
to  Washington,  reviewed  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security 
and  the  FBI.  It  comes  back,  allowing  the  mariner  to,  again,  come 
to the Coast Guard REC and receive his MMD. 

Now, the mariners go through an extensive process for that, and 

that is done on their own. 

But,  after  all  that  he  has  done,  he  will  have  to  go  through  the 

TWIC application process, not to mention—— 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Well,  I  think  it’s  fair  to  say  that  the  com-
plications are not yet fully dealt with, and frankly, maybe not even 
thought about. So, this process has to protect to the—whatever ex-
tent  possible,  the  people  around  the  country  the  harbor  supports 
from attack that could take lives, and really disturb the economies. 
On  the  other  hand,  we  do  have  to  get  to  work,  we  have  hundreds 
of  thousands,  and  the  number,  as  you  heard,  varied  between 
750,000 and 1.5 million—it’s a pretty good spread. But people that 
we have to work with, and a lot of these people are really itinerant 
in their work routines. People come in for a day or two or whatever 
as ordinary labor. But, we have to continue to pursue it. 

The thing that I object to is the ‘‘pie in the sky’’ kind of deadline, 
or  timeline  that’s  expected.  As  I  see  it,  based  on  the  experience 
we’ve  had  so  far,  it’s  totally  unrealistic.  So,  and  we  don’t  want  it 
to  be  competing  with  other  security  measures  that  are,  that  have 
to be taken.

Ms. Himber, how many transportation workers do you think will 

require TWIC cards at the Delaware River ports? 

Ms.  HIMBER.  I’m  sorry  to  say,  Senator,  that  I  don’t  know  that 
anybody  has  a  really  good  feel  for  what  that  number  is.  We’ve 
talked  about,  you  know,  75,000  direct  jobs.  That’s  just  in  the  local 
region,  it  doesn’t  count  truck  drivers  who  come  in  from  other  re-
gions  that  are  not  maritime  areas,  that  might  need  to  get  their 
TWICs in our region. So, I don’t know that anybody has the answer 
to that. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  What’s  the  expected  beginning  roll-out? 

When do they expect to be issuing cards? 

Ms.  HIMBER.  I  have  heard  the  same  thing  that  we  talked  about 
earlier  in  the  Port  of  Wilmington  which  will  be  first,  it’s  at  least 
May, and perhaps later. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  The  complications  are  clear.  We—thank 

you. 

Senator Carper? 
Senator CARPER. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. 
I  just  want  to  say  to  Ms.  Himber,  Beth  Osborne,  remember,  my 
staff who helps on these issues, is very complimentary of the work 
that you have done and expressed great pleasure in that, the rela-
tionship, and the way you approach your responsibilities. 

Ms. HIMBER. Thank you. 
Senator  CARPER.  You’re  the  Vice  President  of  the  Maritime  Ex-

change, is that correct? 

Ms. HIMBER. That’s correct. 
Senator CARPER. Who is the President? 
Ms. HIMBER. Dennis Rochford. 
Senator  CARPER.  It  must  be  a  terrible  burden  to  have  to  carry 

him on your back. How long have you worked there? 

Ms. HIMBER. It’ll be 19 years this year. 
Senator CARPER. Probably seems a lot longer, I’m sure. 
Ms. HIMBER. I was 12 when I started. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  CARPER.  Small  world,  Delaware.  Dennis  and  his  family, 

we go to the same church together, so give him our best. 

Ms. HIMBER. I will. 
Senator  CARPER.  I  want  to  follow  up,  first  of  all,  if  I  could  with 
you, let me just say, Mr. Pomaikai and Mr. Rodriguez, Commander 
Rodriguez—I’m  an  old  Navy  guy,  too.  My  favorite  rank  was  Com-
mander.  I  loved  being  Commander  Carper,  I  hope  you  get  to  be 
one, too. 

Mr. RODRIGUEZ. I hope I get to be one soon. 
Senator  CARPER.  You’re  close,  how  many  years  have  you  put  in? 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. I’ve got 8 good in now, sir. 
Senator  CARPER.  That’s  good.  I  take  our  Boy  Scout  Troop—my 
sons  are  Boy  Scouts—we  go  to  different  service  academies,  and 
Senator  Lautenberg,  Senator  DeMint  and  I  get  to  nominate  young 
men  and  women  to  go  to  these  service  academies,  and  we  went  to 
your academy last year. Had quite a good time. 

What is your first name? 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Michael.

Senator CARPER. I remember seeing scratched on one of the walls 
somewhere, and I think it was a girl’s dorm, ‘‘For a good time, look 
up Michael Rodriguez.’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Senator CARPER. I was wondering about that, so—— 
Mr.  RODRIGUEZ.  I  can  tell  you,  Senator,  there  are  a  couple  of 
loose  boards  at  the  far  end  of  the  football  field  that  say,  ‘‘The 
Rodriguez Exit.’’ 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. I don’t think that’s on the tour, though. 
Senator CARPER. All right. 
Ms.  Himber,  I  think  you  were  talking  about  the  rule,  you  said 

the rule is silent on casual labor, do you remember? 

Ms. HIMBER. That’s correct. 
Senator  CARPER.  Talk  about  that  a  little  bit  more  for  us,  if  you 

will, because there’s a lot of casual labor at these ports. 

Ms.  HIMBER.  The  ports  are  completely  reliant  on  casual  labor, 
and  particularly  during,  what  we  call,  busy  seasons,  in  the  Dela-
ware  River,  as  you  mentioned  earlier,  Chilean  fruit  season.  You 
need additional, you need additional men to work the ships to han-
dle  the  increased  cargo  flows  that  come  in  at  certain  times  of  the 
year. 

You might have, in a season, at just one facility, 75 to 100 poten-
tial,  what  we  call,  casual  workers,  people  who  may  come  one  day 
to  work  on  a  port,  but  you  may  never  see  them  again.  And  that’s 
throughout  the  maritime  industry,  not  just  in  the  Delaware  River. 

Senator CARPER. What do we do about those folks? 
Ms. HIMBER. That’s a big question that nobody, I don’t think, has 

gotten the answer to that. 

Senator  CARPER.  Well,  maybe  I  should  ask,  what  should  we  do? 
Ms. HIMBER. Well, there are some options that are under consid-
eration.  The  regulation,  and  the  draft  Coast  Guard  guidance  docu-
ments allow that these people could be escorted. So, that any TWIC 
holder—perhaps  another  longshoreman,  could  escort  one,  to  pos-
sibly ten, depending on the final decision, non-TWIC holders at any 
given time. We don’t think that’s practical, because the person who 
holds  the  TWIC,  it’s  going  to  be  difficult  enough  for  him  to  do  his 
own job while watching other people. 

Other  suggestions  have  included  the  idea  of,  perhaps,  allowing 
for  some  sort  of  temporary  credential  that  the  port  could  issue, 
very  similar  to  what  ports  are  doing  today  with  issuing  a  visitor’s 
pass.  How  we  could  implement  a  program  like  that  and  still  be  in 
compliance  with  the  legislation,  we’d  have  to  work  through  that, 
but that’s an idea that we think would be worth looking into. 

Senator CARPER. Thank you. 
Mr.  Rodriguez,  two  questions  of  you,  if  I  could.  I  think  you  ex-
pressed some concerns about workers having to bear the cost of the 
issuance of cards, I think we’re heard numbers as high as $150, or 
somewhere in that range. Do you think it’s appropriate for workers 
to pay some portion of the cost of the issuance of these cards? 

Mr.  RODRIGUEZ.  Well,  from  our  standpoint,  Senator,  no.  This  is 
a  function  of  government  to  provide  this,  and  we  believe  that  the 
Department should fund the program.

55 

As  Ms.  Himber  pointed  out  earlier,  there  are  some  workers,  for 

whom, $137 is a day’s pay. That’s quite a bit of money. 

Senator CARPER. Last question for you, if I could, Mr. Rodriguez. 
I think you mentioned how important it was that there is going to 
be  an  adjudication,  there’s  going  to  be  an  appeals  process.  Folks 
are going to be denied a card, and they want to appeal, because of, 
maybe,  a  criminal  record  or  some  other  issue.  And  you  mentioned 
it  was  important  that  we  have  an  adequate  number  of—what  was 
it; administrative law judges? Is that what we’re talking about? 

Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Yes, Senator. 
Senator CARPER. Talk about that just a little bit. 
Mr.  RODRIGUEZ.  If  a  person  is  denied  a  TWIC  because  of  the 
agency’s action, then they have redress with the administrative law 
judge  program.  Our  understanding  right  now  is  that  the  Coast 
Guard  has  seven  openings  for  ALJs  and  there  are  only  five  slots 
filled. So, as this program begins to ramp up, and we start to look 
at  the  numbers,  I  heard  1.5  million  today,  I’ve  been  in  discussions 
that say 2 million. So, there are another 500,000 on the table, pos-
sibly. 

Senator  CARPER.  How  many  administrative  law  judges  would 

there be to handle all of those? 

Mr. RODRIGUEZ. My understanding at this time is there are five. 
Senator CARPER. And, capacity for adding two more? 
Mr.  RODRIGUEZ.  I  believe  there  are  those  billets.  Somebody  else 

might be able to answer that. 

Senator CARPER. Those are going to be very busy people. 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. They would be very busy people, sir. 
Senator CARPER. Thanks very much. 
Senator LAUTENBERG. Senator DeMint, welcome. 

STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DEMINT, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA 

Senator  DEMINT.  Thank  you,  Senator  Lautenberg,  and  I  thank 
everyone  on  the  panel.  We  are  embarking  on  a  very  difficult  task, 
and I appreciate you adding your advice today. 

We’ve  heard  many  considerations  and  I’m  sure  there  are  many 
more  we  haven’t  talked  about.  Certainly  we  have  to  consider  the 
workers  and  fairness  to  workers  as  we  move  forward  with  these 
TWIC  cards.  A  lot  of  technical  considerations,  cost  considerations, 
timing—a  lot  of  things  that  you’ve  brought  up  create  huge  chal-
lenges. 

I  just  want  to  remind  everyone,  in  addition  to  myself,  that  the 
whole  purpose  of  all  of  this  is  security.  That,  as  we  look  at  our 
vulnerabilities as a Nation, we see our ports as one of those points 
of where we’re most vulnerable. Where there’s an opportunity when 
we look at weapons of mass destruction, of possibly moving through 
one of our ports, endangering millions of American lives, and all of 
this,  in  all  of  its  complexity  and  difficult  aspects  comes  back  that 
we’re  trying  to  address  a  very  real  and  new  threat  to  our  country. 
So,  security  is  the  purpose,  and  we’ve  got  to  overcome  these  other 
problems. 

I’d  like  to  just  address  a  question  to  Mr.  Rodriguez,  and  again, 
I appreciate your testimony. As you know, no matter how much we 
spend,  no  matter  how  much  technology  we  have  at  the  port,  such 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

as  the  scanning  devices  and  sensing  devices,  no  matter  how  many 
people  we  have,  all  it’s  going  to  take  is  one  or  two  dock  workers 
cooperating  with  terrorists,  to  circumvent  the  whole  process.  And, 
in  order  for  a  weapon  to  be  smuggled  into  this  country,  a  few  peo-
ple looking the other way can make that happen. 

So,  the  people  in  our  ports  are  terribly  important.  And  that’s 
what this TWIC card is all about; that we can do, at least a reason-
able  level  of  screening  to  know  that  we’ve  done  everything  we  can 
to keep a criminal element from working in our ports. 

Because,  we  don’t  have  to  have  someone  who  has  committed  a 
terrorist  act  before.  Someone  who  has  demonstrated  his  suscepti-
bility  to  criminal  activity  could  think  that  he’s  helping  some  pals 
smuggle in some drugs, when, in fact, it could be a weapon, a dirty 
bomb or something of that nature. 

So, we’ve got a serious problem, the TWIC card is designed to try 
to  screen  out  those  people  who  might  be  susceptible  to  a  criminal 
element.  And  my  question  is  this,  in  the  written  testimony  that 
you’ve  provided,  you’ve  expressed  concern  about  the  broad  descrip-
tions  of  disqualifying  offenses  that  you  think  go  beyond  the  stand-
ard.  What  we’ve  done  in  this  requirement  that  excludes  folks 
who’ve  committed  serious  crimes,  is  adopt,  pretty  much,  what  we 
have  at  our  airports  at  this  point.  What  is  in  the  language  here 
now,  in  the  regulation  is  very  much  like  a  bill  that  we’ve  passed 
in the Senate, it did not survive conference. You say that we’ve got 
too broad a description. In fact, there is nothing broad about it. We 
have very specific listings of crimes that we think reach the thresh-
old  of  criminal  activity  that  we  need  to  avoid  in  our  ports,  and  I 
would just ask you if you could give me some of these disqualifying 
offenses  that  are  listed,  specifically  in  the  regulation,  that  you 
think go beyond a reasonable standard. 

Mr.  RODRIGUEZ.  Senator,  one  off  the  top  of  my  head  are  crimes 
of  dishonesty.  I  think  that’s  quite  vague,  that’s  in  the  regulation. 
Senator  DEMINT.  I  don’t  believe  that’s  in  the  regulation,  is  that 

in the regulation? 

Oh, fraud, you’re talking about—— 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Fraud. 
Senator DEMINT. OK. 
Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Fraud. 
Senator DEMINT. Yes, sir. 
Mr.  RODRIGUEZ.  The  crime  of  robbery,  we  believe  that  in  the 
MTSA  the  standard  is  the  risk  of  terrorism,  it  might  be  arguable 
whether or not that really pre-disposes someone to be a risk for ter-
ror. 

Senator  DEMINT.  I  don’t  see  that  in  the  language,  I  don’t  know 

if you’re using different words or not. 

Mr. RODRIGUEZ. Well, then I need to address that. 
Senator DEMINT. Oh, OK. I’m not trying to quibble. Again, these 
are  very  specific,  as  I  look  at  the  language  of  espionage  and  sedi-
tion,  and  crimes  involving  explosive  devices  and  murder,  and  we 
have  not  picked  small  offenses,  youthful  indiscretions  here  in  this 
language.  We  have  tried  to  include  things  that  indicate  a  serious 
bent  towards  criminal  activity,  and  certainly  I  would  be  interested 
in  any  specific  changes  that  you  have,  and  if  we’ve  got  something 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

57 

such  as  misdemeanors  in  things  that  are  listed,  it’s  a  change  from 
what I’ve seen. Everything is specific in the language. 

What I would just request from you, perhaps, is if you could send 
specific  changes  that  you  would  like,  back  to  the  Committee,  lan-
guage that you think should be omitted and changed. 

Mr.  RODRIGUEZ.  Senator,  I’ll  be  happy  to  do  that.  But  I  would 
like to make the point that we do feel that we have a starting point 
there,  in  the  regulation.  And  that’s  where  these  disqualifying  of-
fenses belong. 

Some  of  the  testimony  today,  some  of  the  reports  we’ve  been 
hearing are that we have this huge number of people that we don’t 
really  have  a  handle  on  yet.  We  want  the  flexibility  in  the  hands 
of the TSA to make those changes. I’ll certainly be happy to provide 
some language for you. 

Senator DEMINT. Well, that would be helpful. Again, the point is 
not to punish workers who need a second chance, but our top secu-
rity  areas  may  not  be  the  place  to  give  some  workers  a  second 
chance if they’ve demonstrated a susceptibility to criminal activity. 
Because,  as  I’ve  said  before,  if  someone  has  been  involved  with 
drug  smuggling,  that  is  still  a  problem  in  our  ports.  If  they  think 
they’re  helping  to  smuggle  drugs,  but  they’re  actually  not  smug-
gling  drugs  at  all,  we  just  need  to  look  at  that.  And  I  think  this 
is  something  that  is  apparently  being  contested,  and  we  need  to 
make sure that this is not something where we create an opening. 
Again, all we have to do is make a few mistakes, and we’ve basi-
cally  undermined  everything  we’re  working  for.  But  thank  you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  And  I  thank  the  witnesses  for  your  state-
ments.  I  found  it  particularly  valuable.  And,  with  that,  this  Com-
mittee hearing is adjourned. 

[Whereupon, at 11:34 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KEN WELLS, PRESIDENT, 

OFFSHORE MARINE SERVICE ASSOCIATION 

The  Offshore  Marine  Service  Association  (OMSA)  thanks  the  Senate  Commerce 
Committee  for  holding  this  hearing  on  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification 
Credential (TWIC) program. We appreciate having the opportunity to submit the fol-
lowing testimony for the record. 

OMSA  is  the  national  association  representing  the  owners  and  operators  of  U.S.- 
flag  vessels  that  support  the  offshore  oil  and  gas  industry.  OMSA’s  members  take 
their  role  in  maintaining  America’s  maritime  security  very  seriously.  They  believe 
that  the  U.S.-flag  vessel,  owned  by  Americans  and  manned  by  Americans,  is  the 
heart  of  our  domestic  maritime  security.  It  has  often  been  repeated  that  the  Coast 
Guard  has  designated  the  American  mariner  as  its  eyes  and  ears  on  the  water.  It 
created  the  Waterways  Watch  program  to  encourage  those  mariners  to  report  sus-
picious activity. Efforts by the U.S. Government to encourage and facilitate the use 
of U.S.-flag vessels in U.S. waters make us all safer and more secure. 

Conversely,  actions  that  make  it  more  difficult  for  U.S.  flag  vessels  to  operate  or 
discourage  U.S.  citizens  from  becoming  mariners  have  the  effect  of  making  us  less 
secure. There is a growing fear in the maritime community that the TWIC program 
as  it  is  emerging  may  disrupt  vessel  operations  and  become  an  obstacle  to  putting 
American  citizens  to  work.  If  that  were  to  happen,  we  would  find  that  our  security 
has been harmed, not enhanced. 

The  OMSA  membership  have  a  number  of  specific  concerns  about  the  TWIC  pro-
gram, but at this point, a primary concern for the maritime sector and for the Con-
gress should be the lack of definition for the program even as it moves to implemen-
tation.  The  Final  Rule  on  TWIC  was  published  at  the  end  of  January  after  a  short 
comment period and an inadequate opportunity for public hearings. In the less than 
3 months since the rule was issued, it has required: 

• Four published corrections; 
• Three published addendum/clarifications; 
• One additional rulemaking on card costs; 
• One  rulemaking  on  technical  standards  for  touchless  readers,  a  concept  that 
• One  draft  Navigation  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular  (NVIC)  on  key  elements 
of the implementation which should have been addressed through a formal rule-
making process, but were not. 

was never included in the original Proposed Rule; and 

There is still no public timetable for rolling out the program in the different ports 
and  Coast  Guard  Sectors.  Now  the  implementation  appears  to  have  been  delayed 
by  up  to  6  months,  but  anxious  mariners  are  still  being  told  that  they  will  need  a 
TWIC  card  by  September  of  2008.  A  key  component,  the  testing  of  TWIC  readers, 
is  still  in  its  infancy  and  the  substantial  debate  over  those  readers  has  yet  to  be 
held.  All  of  this  undercuts  the  integrity  of  the  TWIC  program  and  increases  the 
skepticism of the maritime industry. 

Looking  at  specific  issues,  a  discussion  of  the  impact  of  TWIC  must  begin  with 
the  recognition  that  the  American  mariners  who  crew  U.S.  flag  vessels  already  un-
dergo  some  of  the  most  thorough  background  checks  of  any  transportation  workers 
in  the  world.  This  means  that,  with  or  without  TWIC,  U.S.  seaman  have  already 
been  checked  out  and  approved  by  the  U.S.  Government  to  a  standard  that  is  at 
or above the level that TWIC will require. Ideally, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity  should  have  been  in  a  position  to  develop  a  program  that  built  on  what  was 
already  a  successful  process.  Instead,  the  TWIC  program  and  the  mariner 
credentialing process were developed on two distinct tracks. While the Coast Guard 
is attempting to make those two processes operate concurrently, there is no avoiding 
the  fact  that  they  will  require  mariners  to  go  through  two  separate  processes,  pay 
two fees and undergo two background checks.

It  is  important  to  note  that  any  efficiencies  in  the  background  check  process  will 
have to wait for the development of a new Coast Guard Merchant Mariner Creden-
tial  (MMC).  There  is  no  timetable  for  that  MMC  and,  until  it  is  released,  mariners 
will still have to travel to a TWIC implementation center and undergo a background 
check for a TWIC card and then travel to a Coast Guard Regional Examination Cen-
ter and undergo a subsequent background check for a Merchant Mariner Document 
(MMD). 

The  SAFE  Port  Act  requires  that  the  TWIC  and  Coast  Guard  mariner 
credentialing  be  conducted  concurrently.  As  the  processes  of  the  TSA  and  Coast 
Guard are currently envisioned, this requirement of the law cannot be accomplished. 
This is because the agencies consider issuance of the TWIC to be a prerequisite for 
issuance of a Coast Guard credential. 

If delays in implementation of the TWIC program continue, it may be worth revis-
iting whether the Merchant Mariner Document, with its rigorous background check, 
should  be  accepted  as  meeting  the  requirements  of  TWIC  until  that  program  has 
proven 
its  effectiveness.  This  could  be  accomplished  by  simply  exempting 
credentialed  mariners  from  the  requirement  to  obtain  a  TWIC  for  a  period  of  time 
with  the  understanding  that  the  Coast  Guard  will  continue  to  do  the  background 
checks.  Mariners  could  then  be  folded  into  the  TWIC  process  once  the  large  num-
bers  of  other  maritime  transportation  workers  have  been  processed  and  the  Coast 
Guard MMC is in place. 

Much  has  been  said  about  the  need  for  temporary  work  authority,  a  simple  and 
expedient  way  to  put  mariners  to  work  while  their  TWIC  is  being  processed.  The 
process  that  was  made  a  part  of  the  Final  Rule  does  not  meet  the  spirit  or  letter 
of the SAFE Port Act and is far too cumbersome and difficult to administer to meet 
the intent of Congress. The rule promulgated by the TSA addresses the requirement 
for  temporary  work  authority  by  requiring  companies  to  complete  onerous  paper-
work  if  they  want  to  grant  employees  unescorted  access  to  MTSA  regulated  vessels 
or  facilities.  New  hires  after  passing  an  initial  security  screen  by  TSA,  and  after 
companies  complete  the  administrative  requirements  may  then  be  granted 
‘‘unescorted’’  access  so  long  as  they  are  ‘‘accompanied.’’  The  Rule  does  not  ade-
quately define either ‘‘unescorted’’ or ‘‘accompanied’’ in such a way as to give compa-
nies any confidence that their use of newly hired workers will be acceptable. 

Other  groups  have  suggested  much  simpler  but  effective  approaches  and  we  sup-
port  those  suggestions.  However,  we  point  out  one  nuance  that  should  not  be 
missed.  Many  mariners  who  would  fall  under  this  temporary  worker  concept  will 
also  need  a  Coast  Guard  credential.  So  far,  the  Coast  Guard  has  been  unwilling  to 
also  allow  for  temporary  mariner  credentials  to  go  along  with  the  temporary  TWIC 
authorization.  Mariners  will  need  both  and  they  will  need  the  process  to  be  simple 
and expedient. Unfortunately, any process that is not simple will result in more cost 
for the maritime industry and more hands-on activity by government agencies. 

On  a  related  note,  a  law  change  may  be  necessary  to  allow  for  the  waiver  for 
TWIC requirements in the event of a national emergency, such as a hurricane. Our 
industry’s  mariners  experienced  this  problem  firsthand  with  the  loss  of  the  Coast 
Guard’s  Regional  Examination  Center  in  New  Orleans  as  the  result  of  Hurricane 
Katrina.  The  Coast  Guard  has  asked  Congress  to  grant  it  the  authority  to  waive 
license  and  credential  expiration  dates  in  these  sorts  of  emergencies.  It  may  also 
be necessary to waive TWIC expiration dates. Again, because the decision was made 
to  require  mariners  to  meet  both  requirements,  any  effort  to  mitigate  the  problems 
caused  by  a  disruption  of  the  government  service  will  require  that  both  TWIC  and 
merchant mariner credentials be extended. 

There  are  real  concerns  over  the  processing  of  TWIC  applications.  More  informa-
tion is needed on how the Transportation Security Agency intends to meet the staff-
ing levels to expedite processing, especially as the estimated numbers of Americans 
required  to  obtain  a  TWIC  card  continues  to  grow.  Clearly,  many  transportation 
workers will sail through the TWIC process without problems and will hopefully re-
ceive  their  TWIC  card  within  the  time-frames  that  TSA  has  estimated.  Just  as 
clearly,  some  potential  workers  will  be  permanently  rejected  based  on  the  disquali-
fying  offenses  in  the  law.  However,  there  will  also  be  a  third  group  that  will  fall 
somewhere  in  the  middle.  These  individuals  may  have  their  initial  application  re-
jected  because  of  errors  or  because  they  committed  an  offense  that  requires  a  judg-
ment call by someone in government. 

Focusing  for  a  moment  on  individuals  who  may  be  rejected  by  mistake,  we  can 
only  look  at  the  TSA  No-Fly  List  to  see  the  problems  that  this  could  create.  Much 
attention has been focused on individuals, including small children, Coast Guard of-
ficials  and  even  U.S.  Senators  who  have  found  themselves  on  the  No-Fly  List.  Sev-
eral years after the No-Fly List was created, TSA is still wrestling with how to best 
remove  people  who  should  not  be  on  the  list.  TSA  has  been  silent  on  how  it  will

ensure that maritime transportation workers will not be rejected in error or because 
they have the misfortune of sharing a common name. 

Turning to workers who have committed an offense that requires some interpreta-
tion,  the  list  of  crimes  that  are  not  permanently  disqualifying  crimes  is  extremely 
vague.  The  primary  example  may  be  that  of  ‘‘dishonesty,  fraud  or  misrepresenta-
tion.’’ If a transportation worker was once convicted of using a false ID to purchase 
alcohol or for purchasing alcohol for a minor, those are regrettable offenses, but they 
do not make that individual a terrorism suspect. 

As  an  example  of  this,  Operation  Drydock  was  the  Coast  Guard’s  comprehensive 
effort  to  ensure  that  mariners  did  not  receive  false  documents.  The  exhaustive  re-
search  into  mariner  credentials  exposed  several  hundred  instances  in  which  mari-
ners  were  not  truthful  on  their  applications.  However,  these  were  correctly  judged 
to  be  efforts  by  those  mariners  to  avoid  admitting  to  a  minor  offense  in  their  past. 
Action  was  only  taken  against  a  small  handful  of  mariners  who  were  judged  to  be 
truly fraudulent or potential security risks. The lesson was plain, there are and will 
be cases of dishonesty that should not be disqualifying events. Those workers should 
be  allowed  to  obtain  a  TWIC,  but  it  will  take  some  form  of  human  assessment  to 
clear them. TSA should say how it will ensure that those applications are reviewed 
quickly and effectively. 

Unfortunately,  the  TWIC  appeal  and/or  waiver  process  could  delay  approval  for 
these  transportation  workers  for  months.  The  procedures  seem  to  be  clearly  de-
signed to allow for denial due to a failure of the applicant to comply with the rules 
or  time  frames.  There  are  no  requirements  for  timely  review  or  response  by  the 
TSA,  or  applicant  review  of  detrimental  information  that  is  deemed  ‘‘secret’’  by  the 
government. At Congress’ insistence, the rule allows for an appeal to an Administra-
tive Law Judge, but given the limits on the ALJ resources, this will be a long proc-
ess  and  may  only  be  a  ‘‘court  of  last  appeals’’  for  the  most  dedicated  workers.  It  is 
likely that most entry level workers will have given up and gotten another job long 
before they have exhausted the appeals process. 

Throughout the development of the TWIC card process, there have been numerous 
examples  of  the  agencies  ignoring  well  established  vessel  operations  and  imposing 
an unworkable approach. For instance, where the industry raised concerns over lost 
TWIC cards keeping mariners from going to work, the Final Rule says that a work-
er  who  loses  a  card  will  have  7  days  in  which  to  work  while  the  replacement  card 
is  being  processed.  This  ignores  the  fact  that  much  of  the  maritime  sector  works 
a  28  day  shift,  making  it  impossible  to  apply  for  a  replacement  card  and  then  go 
to work on the vessel. 

The biggest unresolved aspect of TWIC involves the reader machines. The MTSA 
legislation  that  called  for  the  creation  of  the  TWIC  program  does  not  require  the 
use  of  reader  systems.  The  Final  Rule  makes  it  clear  that  the  agency  does  not  be-
lieve it needs Congressional approval to impose reader systems. The Department of 
Homeland  Security  has  yet  to  make  the  case  for  how  readers  on  vessels  will  en-
hance security, especially in a cost effective way. 

In fact, the debate over readers has not yet happened. However, the planning for 
readers  is  moving  ahead  in  advance  of  the  debate  and,  we  believe,  in  advance  of 
the  intent  of  Congress.  The  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee 
(NMSAC)  assigned  by  TSA  to  develop  a  touchless  biometric  standard  for  readers 
cautioned  TSA  in  its  final  report  that  prior  to  implementing  any  reader  require-
ments  that  the  public  debate  on  the  technology  should  be  conducted.  To  emphasize 
this  failing,  a  minority  report  was  submitted  to  TSA  signed  jointly  by  industry 
groups and organized labor stating in part that ‘‘. . . TSA and Coast Guard should 
use the expertise of the various vessel operating communities to determine whether 
or not any use of TWIC readers is justified on any vessels.’’ 

The  SAFE  Port  Act  required  that  TSA  perform  a  test  of  reader  technology  at  fa-
cilities and on vessels and report back to Congress in 6 month increments until the 
pilot  program  is  concluded.  TSA  has  reported  that  it  intends  to  use  port  security 
grants  to  fund  the  tests.  This  presents  a  number  of  practical  problems.  First,  the 
port  security  grants  are  not  generally  open  to  vessel  operators.  Second,  the  agency 
has not made a concerted effort to engage vessel operators in these grants. Finally, 
by  wedding  the  reader  tests  to  the  grant  process,  TSA  has  created  a  number  of  ob-
stacles for vessel operators, such as:

mechanism established. 

62 

The  schedules  for  the  testing  and  the  schedule  for  the  final  rule  are  also  in  con-
flict. The Congressional timetable requires that the report of the tests be completed 
within  20  months,  but  TSA  has  said  publicly  that  it  plans  to  issue  a  final  rule  on 
readers  in  January  of  2009  and  that  they  will  issue  the  reader  rules  independent 
of  the  study.  Under  these  timetables,  the  users  will  be  asked  to  comment  and  the 
agency  will  make  a  decision  on  a  technology  that  it  has  not  had  a  chance  to  ade-
quately test and evaluate. Clearly this does not fit anyone’s definition of sound pub-
lic  policy,  especially  for  a  testing  program  that  has  already  been  identified  by  the 
GAO as being problematic. 

In discussing maritime operations we must stress that safety is the primary goal, 
trumping even security. Lives lost at sea by unsafe operations must be avoided. Re-
quirements must be judged by whether they harm safety before they are blindly ac-
cepted  in  the  name  of  security.  Unfortunately,  there  has  been  little  or  no  consider-
ation  of  what  the  reader  proposal  might  do  to  safety.  For  example,  the  NMSAC  re-
port  on  card  readers  indicates  that  they  will  be  wired  so  that  the  ‘‘electrical  signal 
from  the  panel  used  to  command  the  door’s  electromechanical  locking  mechanism.’’ 
Vessels  do  not  have  any  such  capability  and  years  of  experience  have  shown  the 
danger of locking public access doors on vessels. It is the sort of fundamental accept-
ance of vessel safety that has been missing from the TWIC development. 

OMSA’s members operate vessels that have relatively small crews who have been 
specifically  assigned  by  a  company  to  serve  on  a  specific  vessel.  Requiring  one  or, 
according  to  the  proposed  rule  on  TWIC,  several  readers  on  the  vessel  does  not  en-
hance  security,  but  does  dramatically  drive  up  the  cost  of  the  program.  Congress 
assigned  the  Commandant  the  authority  to  waive  the  requirement  for  smaller  ves-
sels  based  on  crew  size.  OMSA’s  members  believe  this  authority  should  be  used  in 
such a way as to exclude offshore vessels from the reader requirement. 

Finally,  one  of  TSA’s  implementation  plans  will  significantly  increase  the  cost  of 
the  program  and  has  not  received  the  attention  it  deserves.  At  a  recent  meeting  of 
the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee,  TSA  officials  indicated  that 
they  were  finalizing  the  new  standard  for  touchless  reader  systems  and,  when  that 
standard  was  finalized,  it  would  be  necessary  for  every  TWIC  holder  to  return  to 
a TWIC processing center to have his or her card reprogrammed. This unanticipated 
requirement  will  cost  the  offshore  sector  several  million  dollars  alone  in  lost  time 
and travel costs. 

In  conclusion,  the  maritime  industry  has  a  number  of  concerns  about  the  TWIC 
program. The specific concerns need to be addressed, but there is a larger scale con-
cern that the program is still ill-defined and does not have the support of the indus-
try that will be most affected by it. 

Thank  you  for  allowing  the  maritime  industry  to  submit  testimony  on  this  issue. 
We would be happy to respond to any follow-up questions the Committee may have. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE PASSENGER VESSEL ASSOCIATION 

The  Passenger  Vessel  Association  (PVA)—the  national  trade  association  of  U.S.- 
flagged passenger vessels of all types—appreciates this opportunity to submit testi-
mony on the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC). 

Our  primary  message  is:  TWIC  will  affect  hundreds  of  employers  and  thousands 
of employees who are not engaged in international ocean cargo shipping. Therefore, 
the  TWIC  system  must  take  into  account  the  different  circumstances  of  this  seg-
ment of the maritime industry. 

PVA understands and supports rational security measures. Many of its members’ 
vessels  operate  in  compliance  with  an  approved  security  plan,  as  required  by  the 
Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act.  PVA  has  developed  a  Coast  Guard-approved 
Alternative  Security  Program,  as  allowed  by  the  MTSA  rule.  Yet,  this  implementa-
tion has been very expensive for our companies. Some have hired a Company Secu-
rity Officer, a new position for them, to assist in the completion of risk-based threat 
assessments,  identify  vulnerabilities,  and  establish  procedures  to  control  access  to 
the restricted areas of their vessels. PVA members have undertaken extensive train-
ing,  drills,  and  audits.  All  of  this  work  has  costs  associated  with  it.  Still  to  come 
are the costs of TWICs, vessel-tracking Automatic Identification Systems (AIS), and 
perhaps TWIC readers. 

Our  members  believe  that  a  small  company  does  not  need  an  electronic  TWIC 
card or a TWIC reader to know that employees Sam and Karly or Bill are who they 
say  they  are  when  they  show  up  to  work  each  day.  They  are  the  same  Sam  and 
Karly and Bill that the small company interviewed, hired and trained. They believe

that  there  are  other  methods  that  can  be  used  to  verify  the  status  of  identification 
that present little or no cost to the small employer. 

Congress  intended  TWIC  to  focus  on  large  ships  that  operate  at  commercial  port 
facilities  where  the  flow  of  cargo  depends  on  numerous  non-vessel,  non-facility  em-
ployees  going  in  and  out  of  the  port.  PVA  does  not  believe  that  a  small  passenger 
operation  such  as  operated  by  many  of  its  members  was  ever  envisioned  by  Con-
gress to be included in the security concerns of America’s ports. 
Our Members Need To Put Individuals To Work Promptly 

In  our  segment  of  the  maritime  industry,  the  ability  to  hire  employees  and  have 
them go to work quickly is absolutely essential. Seasonal operators make up a large 
portion  of  our  membership.  Such  an  operator  may  hire  seasonal  workers  for  up  to 
80  percent  of  the  staff,  including  deckhands,  wait  staff,  and  bartenders.  The  pool 
of  potential  employees  includes  students,  teachers,  and  retirees.  Clearly,  these  em-
ployees are not ‘‘professional’’ mariners. It is not uncommon for there to be 100 per-
cent  turnover  of  seasonal  employees  from  1  year  to  the  next.  These  people  may  be 
hired only days before they begin work on the passenger vessel. 

Our members compete aggressively with many other businesses for good seasonal 
employees.  Our  competitors  for  employees  are  hotels,  marinas  and  restaurants,  not 
subject  to  the  TWIC  requirement.  Most  of  our  seasonal  employees  are  college  or 
high school students who need a job when school ends to make the money they need 
for  the  next  school  year.  This  generally  means  they  are  available  to  the  employer 
for approximately 90–100 days. They cannot apply for this summer employment and 
then wait 30 days for an ID card. They cannot even wait 2 weeks. 

It is essential for the law and TWIC rule to recognize the ‘‘facts of life’’ regarding 
employees  on  domestic  passenger  vessels.  The  rule  needs  to  accommodate  the  need 
to hire these folks quickly. 

PVA  acknowledges  and  appreciates  the  provision  in  the  SAFE  Port  Act  (section 
104(c) of Public Law 109–347) mandating that the final rule allow employers to put 
newly-hired  workers  on  the  job  pending  the  processing  and  issuance  of  a  TWIC. 
That provision states: ‘‘The regulations shall include a background check process to 
enable newly hired workers to begin working unless the Secretary makes an initial 
determination  that  the  worker  poses  a  security  risk.  Such  a  process  shall  include 
a  check  against  the  consolidated  and  integrated  terrorist  watch  list  maintained  by 
the Federal Government.’’ The final rule attempts to comply by purporting to allow 
employers  to  put  new  hires  to  work  with  ‘‘accompanied’’  access  to  secure  areas  for 
up to 30 days once new hires have applied for their TWIC and an initial name-based 
check  is  completed.  PVA  remains  concerned,  however,  as  to  how  this  provision  will 
work in real life. 
Reduce The Direct And Indirect Costs Of The TWIC 

Most  seasonal  or  temporary  workers  on  domestic  passenger  vessel  cannot  afford 
or will not pay $137 for a TWIC, particularly when they have other job options that 
do  not  entail  such  a  requirement.  Congress  must  realize  that  domestic  passenger 
vessel operators will be forced to pay the application fee for these potential employ-
ees,  as  they  now  pay  for  their  pre-employment  drug  test,  first-aid  training,  and  se-
curity  training,  all  currently  required  for  their  employees,  but  not  required  of  the 
waterfront restaurant or the marina up the street. 

There  are  other  unaccounted-for  costs  of  this  rulemaking.  One  cost  is  the  trans-
portation  costs  for  the  employee  to  travel  to  the  enrollment  center.  In  fact,  the  em-
ployee  must  travel  twice  to  the  enrollment  center,  first  to  apply,  then  to  pick  up 
the  TWIC.  That  means  two  round  trips,  costing  gas,  parking,  and  time  away  from 
the job. Not once, but twice! For many employees, the passenger vessel operator will 
have to provide this transportation when employees either don’t drive or don’t have 
transportation.  Many  would  have  to  have  Mom  or  Dad  drive  them.  This  is  a  road-
block  to  hiring  good  seasonal  employees.  If  asked  to  make  this  trip,  no  matter  who 
pays for it, most will simply chose to work elsewhere. It’s just too much trouble for 
a summer job. 

How  many  TWIC  cards  will  be  requested  by  applicants  who  change  their  mind 
and  go  to  work  at  the  restaurant  down  the  street  when  they  find  out  that  the  res-
taurant  will  put  them  to  work  right  away?  How  many  TWIC  cards  will  be  issued, 
and  the  applicant  never  picks  up  the  card,  because  Mom  decided  the  family  was 
going on vacation instead? How many new hires will quit after the first day? These 
are the unintended costs for the small employer that we are concerned about. 
WIC  Enrollment  Centers  Must  Be  Located  In  Places  That  Are  Not  Tradi-

tional Ports 

Also,  PVA  fears  that  the  contractor  will  be  inclined  to  locate  TWIC  enrollment 
centers only in large port cities. This will be where the contractor can achieve econo-

mies of scale to make a profit on the contract. However, in real life, many PVA oper-
ators  are  located  in  remote  locations  that  are  not  considered  to  be  major  maritime 
centers—places like the islands of Kauai and Maui, Ketchikan and Kodiak in Alas-
ka,  Down  East  locations  in  Maine,  Lake  Tahoe  and  Lake  Powell,  and  inland  towns 
such  as  Omaha,  Pierre,  and  La  Crosse,  Wisconsin.  PVA  has  provided  the  Coast 
Guard and the contractor with a list of suggested places for enrollment centers that 
are not traditional maritime centers but that are necessary to accommodate our seg-
ment of the U.S.-flag industry. PVA urges the Senate to instruct the contractor and 
the  Coast  Guard  that  contractor  profit  can  not  be  the  only  or  even  the  controlling 
factor in the placement of TWIC enrollment centers. 
No Burdensome Recordkeeping On The Employer 

PVA  also  objected  to  the  provision  in  the  proposed  rule  to  require  each  employer 
to  keep  detailed  records  for  2  years,  showing  every  occasion  on  which  an  employee 
enters a secure area. This would do nothing to prevent security incidents, but would 
impose  a  huge  paperwork  burden  on  a  small  business.  Why  add  a  new  redundant 
recordkeeping  requirement,  on  top  of  the  payroll  records  and  vessel  log  books  that 
our  members  already  maintain?  Fortunately,  the  Federal  agencies  deferred  action 
on  this  proposal  for  now,  but  PVA  urges  the  Senate  to  ensure  that  this  bad  idea 
is not resurrected. 

Thank you for your interest in the special needs of the U.S.-flagged passenger ves-
sel industry, particularly the hundreds of small employers in this segment who fall 
within the purview of the TWIC requirement. Congress, the Transportation Security 
Administration,  and  the  Coast  Guard  must  keep  in  mind  that  an  appropriate  level 
of  maritime  security  can  be  achieved  without  unnecessarily  harming  American 
small businesses. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE MARITIME TRADES DEPARTMENT, AFL–CIO 

The  Maritime  Trades  Department,  AFL–CIO,  consists  of  24  international  unions 
and  19  port  maritime  councils  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  representing  ap-
proximately  5.5  million  working  men  and  women.  The  vast  majority  of  those  work-
ers  live  and  work  in  the  United  States.  Virtually  all  of  them  stand  to  be  affected 
by  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  program,  whether 
they work aboard vessels or in shipyards or elsewhere in the marine transportation 
sector. 

The MTD thanks the Committee for this chance to convey our views on the imple-
mentation of the TWIC program in the maritime sector. The program is enormously 
relevant  to  our  affiliated  unions  and  their  members.  The  MTD  submits  these  com-
ments on their behalf, with particular emphasis on the U.S. Merchant Marine:

The MTD acknowledges the scope, complexity, and challenge of protecting our Na-
tion  and  our  maritime  transportation  network  from  terrorists.  We  believe  that  a 
safe, secure and reliable maritime transportation system is vital to this Nation’s eco-
nomic, defense and national security. To that end, MTD affiliates have implemented 
many  educational  and  training  programs  responding  to  the  mandates  of  the  Mari-
time  Transportation  Security  Act  of  2002  (MTSA)  and  the  International  Ship  and 
Port  Facility  Security  (ISPS)  Code  and,  further,  have  offered  their  assistance  and 
views  to  the  government  in  its  efforts  to  devise  and  implement  appropriate  meas-
ures to protect this Nation and our transportation sector from terrorism. 

The  MTD  generally  endorses  the  concept  contained  in  the  statute  for  a  biometric 
transportation security card. However, there are certain items within the implemen-
tation  of  the  statute  by  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  that  warrant 
our concern and comment. The MTD will focus its comments on those issues, as fol-
lows. 
Merchant Mariner Document (MMD) 

The  MTD  endorses  the  idea  of  a  biometric  transportation  security  card,  as  man-
dated  by  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  of  2002.  The  MTD  appreciates 
the efforts and time expended by the Transportation Security Administration in at-
tempting  to  implement  this  requirement.  However,  we  believe  that  the  complicated 
and  burdensome  process  finalized  by  the  agency  is  both  unnecessary  for  merchant 
mariners and may prove severely disruptive to maritime commerce. 

As both the MTD and our affiliated unions have repeatedly advocated, the current 
Merchant  Mariner  Document  could  and  should  be  modified  to  include  an  encoded 
biometric,  to  be  used  as  a  biometric  transportation  security  card  in  lieu  of  the 
TWIC,  especially  since  the  Coast  Guard  recognizes  the  MMD  as  an  identity  docu-
ment.  We  question  the  need  for  yet  another  document  that  the  merchant  mariner 
must  obtain  and  carry  when  the  current  and  time-tested  Merchant  Mariner  Docu-
ment  may  be  adapted  to  encapsulate  an  encoded  biometric.  The  MTD  believes  that 
with a security vetting process (threat assessment), preferably initiated by the Coast 
Guard, the biometric MMD would adequately respond to the mandate of the MTSA 
for a biometric transportation security card, given the fact that the Coast Guard ad-
vises  that  a  security  assessment  is  not  required  for  the  mariner  population  who 
have an MMD issued after February 3, 2003, implying that those mariners have un-
dergone  a  full  security  vetting  by  the  Coast  Guard  and  therefore  need  not  undergo 
a  TWIC  security  assessment.  The  MTD  urges  the  Committee  to  consider  this  sim-
plified approach for merchant mariners who are required to hold Merchant Mariner 
Documents instead of agreeing to the TSA implementation process as enunciated in 
its final rule. 

Further, the MTD believes that the Coast Guard itself has the authority to imple-
ment the biometric transportation security card mandate as recommended above. In 
fact,  the  MTSA  requires  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  to  issue  a  biometric 
transportation  security  credential  to  merchant  mariners.  Section  102  of  the  MTSA 
defines ‘‘Secretary’’ to mean ‘‘the Secretary in which the Coast Guard is operating.’’ 
It is our view that within this definition, the Coast Guard has the authority to issue 
an MMD with an encoded biometric as a merchant mariner biometric transportation 
security  credential.  Moreover,  this  would  certainly  negate  the  need  for  a  change  in 
the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  as  proposed  in  USCG–2006–24371,  the  Consolida-
tion  of  Merchant  Mariner  Qualification  Credentials,  currently  being  considered  as 
a supplementary proposed rulemaking. 

A  further  reason  for  utilizing  a  biometric  merchant  mariner  document  in  lieu  of 
a  TWIC  is  the  fact  that  the  final  rule  proposes  standards  which  will  primarily  im-
pact merchant mariners and port workers. Why reinvent the wheel when a proven, 
time-tested,  and  internationally  accepted  document  already  exists  that,  with  some 
modification, responds to the mandate of the MTSA? In addition, to date, there are 
no  TWIC  requirements  for  other  workers  in  all  modes  of  transportation.  It  is  our 
view that if the TWIC is not applicable to all modes of transportation, then the sys-

66 

tem is essentially flawed due to port intermodalism and the security objective is un-
dermined. 
User Fees 

In  its  final  rule,  the  TSA  proposes  to  establish  new  user  fees  for  the  TWIC  proc-
ess.  Although  the  MTD  opposes  a  TWIC  requirement  for  merchant  mariners,  we 
nonetheless  state  that  it  is  patently  unfair  to  impose  yet  another  user  fee  on  the 
merchant  mariner  for  a  credential  that  can  be  encompassed  in  the  MMD.  In  fact, 
the  merchant  mariner  is  already  charged  a  user  fee  for  the  process  associated  with 
the MMD. The MTD is aware that Section 520 of the 2004 DHS Appropriations Act 
requires TSA to charge a reasonable fee for providing credentialing and background 
investigations in the field of transportation. The principle behind user fees is based 
on  the  philosophy  that  beneficiaries  of  Federal  expenditures  should  repay  the  gov-
ernment in the form of a user charge on all or a portion of the Federal expenditures 
incurred for a service. User fees are based on the premise that some agency services 
are  of  benefit  only  to  particular  segments  of  the  population  and  that  fairness  dic-
tates  that  these  services  be  subject  to  user  fees.  However,  the  MTD  contends  that 
the  TWIC  program  is  not  of  benefit  to  a  particular  segment  of  the  population—the 
merchant  mariner  in  this  case—but  primarily  in  the  interest  of  public  security.  It 
is  our  belief  that  one  of  the  key  criteria  regarding  the  application  of  a  user  fee  for 
TSA services rendered is whether the service provides a special benefit to an identi-
fiable  recipient  above  and  beyond  those  that  accrue  to  the  public  at  large.  In  this 
case,  it  does  not.  Therefore,  given  the  fact  that  obtaining  a  TWIC  is  in  the  interest 
of  public  security,  merchant  mariners  should  not  be  assessed  a  user  fee.  It.  is  nei-
ther  fair  nor  reasonable  to  assess  a  user  fee  on  a  merchant  mariner  for  a  security 
mandate  that  has  broader  benefits.  The  background  checks  and  security  threat  as-
sessments contained in the implementing final rule are considered necessary to en-
hance  the  security  of  our  Nation’s  ports  and  are  part  of  an  overall  effort  to  fight 
terrorism elements. 
Federal Preemption 

The MTD recognizes and acknowledges the fact that states have the right to regu-
late access to their port facilities. However, once a national identity standard is pro-
mulgated, it is critically important that these standards supersede state regulations. 
Thus, the MTD recommends that the Federal TWIC or MMD program preempt any 
state  or  local  regulations  covering  identity  cards  for  mariners.  The  entire  purpose 
of  an  identification  credential  is  to  provide  a  universally  recognized  identity  card 
and to assure a mariner access to vessels and port facilities. In addition, the manda-
tory  provisions  of  the  International  Maritime  Organization’s  ISPS  Code  require  fa-
cilitation  of  access  by  mariners.  Additional  state  or  local  requirements  will  create 
confusion  and  intolerable  conditions  for  mariners,  undermine  the  purpose  of  the 
TWIC,  and  disrupt  interstate  and  foreign  waterborne  commerce.  Allowing  states  to 
arbitrarily  impose  different  or  added  security  requirements  is  inconsistent  with  the 
intent of the TSA to achieve a level of consistency governing threat assessments and 
transportation credentials. 
Additional Comments on the TWIC Program 

The  MTD  believes  that  the  TWIC  program,  as  explained  in  its  final  rule,  will 
cause  many  unnecessary  problems  within  the  maritime  industry,  including  poten-
tially severe disruption to the livelihoods of mariners and other transportation work-
ers  who  pose  no  threat  to  security  and  who  have  done  nothing  wrong.  It  will  not 
enhance  security  but  will  certainly  disrupt  commerce  and  place  an  intolerable  bur-
den  on  American  merchant  mariners.  The  program  is  also  flawed  since  it  exempts 
foreign  seamen  from  the  process  while  focusing  completely  on  U.S.  merchant  mari-
ners  who  are  screened,  regulated  and  fully  vetted  by  the  Coast  Guard.  It  has  been 
estimated that 97 percent of our imports and exports are carried on foreign-flag ves-
sels  with  foreign  crews  who  in  our  view  pose  the  gravest  security  risk.  Yet,  these 
crews are exempt from the TWIC requirements. In addition to our recommendations 
mentioned above, the MTD also advocates: 

• That  any  national  TWIC  issued  to  American  merchant  mariners  must  be  com-
patible  with  the  International  Labor  Organization’s  Convention  185  (Seafarers 
Identity  Document)  so  that  there  will  be  a  consistency  between  national  and 
international identity credentials. 
• By  the  nature  of  their  employment,  mariners  require  access  to  secure  areas 
throughout  a  port,  a  state,  or  even  internationally.  If  mariners  are  required  to 
obtain a TWIC, they should be guaranteed unfettered access to ports. 
• There  must  be  a  clear  nexus  between  terrorism  security  and  the  crimes  that 
will disqualify an individual from holding a maritime TWIC, as the list of felony

offenses  that  will  disqualify  a  mariner  from  obtaining  a  maritime  TWIC  is  too 
expansive, nebulous and unfocused on eliminating true security risks. Although 
some  modifications  were  made  in  the  final  rule  to  the  original  list  of  disquali-
fying offenses, the MTD urges the TSA to exercise appropriate discretion to not 
deny  employment  opportunities  to  those  mariners  who  may  have  simply  made 
a mistake years ago. 

U.S.  mariners  are  and  will  always  be  an  effective  asset  in  the  global  war  on  ter-
rorism. They are the best trained, most qualified and most thoroughly vetted work-
ers in the transportation industry. The U.S. Merchant Marine’s history of answering 
the  call  to  perform  our  patriotic  duty  in  every  conflict  and  disaster  is  a  matter  of 
public  record.  In  summary  and  to  be  clear,  we  urge  the  TSA  to  recognize  the  con-
tributions of American mariners to the economic and defense security of our Nation 
by exempting them from the unnecessary burden of obtaining a TWIC. 

The MTD remains ready to work cooperatively with the Committee, the Transpor-
tation  Security  Administration  and  the  Coast  Guard  to  identify  and  implement  the 
most  fair  and  effective  systems  that  promote  security  in  the  domestic  maritime 
transportation network. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY 

Question  1.  When  will  the  Department  provide  Congress  with  the  comprehensive 
management  plan  for  TWIC  that  was  required  in  the  Intelligence  Reform  Act  of 
2004 and is over 2 years past due? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  Program  Manage-
ment Plan, as required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 
2004,  is  currently  undergoing  executive  level  review  and  clearance  within  the  De-
partment.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  anticipates  delivery  to  Con-
gress in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. 

Question 2. Of the 4,000 TWIC cards you reported issued in the prototype testing, 
how  many  were  activated?  Of  those  activated  how  many  were  actually  tested  with 
a biometric card reader? Were any tested on vessels? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  issued  4,362  cards  during 
the prototype, all of which were activated. While we do not have data on how many 
of  the  activated  cards  were  used  in  biometric  readers,  3,209  biometric  access  at-
tempts  were  made  during  the  prototype  phase.  No  readers  were  tested  on  vessels 
during the prototype phase. 

Question  3.  What  vessel  operators  have  you  and  the  Coast  Guard  identified  for 
participation  in  the  card  reader  pilot  mandated  in  the  SAFE  Port  Act?  How  many 
vessels and over what duration of time do you plan on testing the technology? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  plans  to  test 
contactless  biometric  authentication  technology  that  meets  the  requirements  of  the 
Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  reader  specification  in  a 
variety of maritime operational scenarios (container, bulk, petroleum, and passenger 
terminals; and vessels), as well as in different geographic regions and climates. The 
final  reader  specification  is  pending  a  review  of  comments  received  from  the  public 
notice  of  the  specifications  recommended  by  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advi-
sory  Committee.  The  TWIC  program,  with  assistance  from  other  Department  of 
Homeland Security components, is developing a comprehensive Test and Evaluation 
Master Plan which we anticipate completing this summer. Planning for this project 
has been underway since December 2006. 

TSA  is  reviewing  potential  participants  for  the  upcoming  card  reader  pilot  tests 
but they have not yet been finalized. Discussions are ongoing with the Ports of Los 
Angeles and Long Beach as well as the Ports of New York and New Jersey to iden-
tify  vessel  participants  to  include  small  passenger  vessels  and  ferries.  We  are  also 
working  with  the  American  Waterways  Operators  Association  to  identify  an  appro-
priate  participant  for  the  towboat  and  tug  boat  industry.  The  duration  of  the  pilot 
tests will be such that the card readers will be tested under various environmental 
and operational conditions, although the duration has not yet been finalized. 

Question 4. You mention in your testimony that the TSA has ‘‘created a new proc-
ess where the TSA can make a determination that a security threat assessment con-
ducted  by  another  government  agency  is  comparable,  eliminating  redundancy  and 
reducing costs for workers.’’ Can you describe this? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  may  determine  that 
security  threat  assessments  conducted  by  other  governmental  agencies  are  com-
parable to the Transportation Worker Identification Credential/Hazardous Materials 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

Endorsement threat assessment. In making a comparability determination, TSA will 
consider (1) the minimum standards used for the security threat assessment; (2) the 
frequency  of  the  threat  assessment;  (3)  the  date  of  the  most  recent  threat  assess-
ment;  and  4)  whether  the  threat  assessment  includes  biometric  identification  and 
a  biometric  credential.  The  procedures  to  apply  for  a  comparability  determination 
are  outlined  in  49  CFR  § 1572.5(e)  Comparability  of  Other  Security  Threat  Assess-
ment  Standards.  TSA  will  notify  the  public  by  publishing  a  Notice  in  the  Federal 
Register when a comparability determination is made. 

Question  5.  Have  you  reached  out  to  other  agencies  such  as  the  Department  of 
Defense  and  the  Department  of  Energy  to  determine  what  background  check  and 
credentialing  process  they  have  in  place  and  how  are  they  comparable  to  TSA’s 
background  checks  for  TWIC?  What  credentialing  programs  have  you  found  to  be 
comparable to other Federal agencies’ programs? 

Answer. The Transportation Security Administration discussed comparability with 
both  the  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  and  the  Department  of  Energy.  DOD  is 
gathering  the  information  needed  in  order  to  make  a  comparability  determination. 
Thus far, the background checks performed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
for the Free and Secure Trade program, and the U.S. Coast Guard for the Merchant 
Mariner  Document  program,  have  been  determined  to  be  comparable  to  that  of  the 
Transportation Worker Identification Credential. 

Question  6.  I  understand  you  have  developed  procedures  to  reduce  the  TWIC  fee 
for transportation worker that have had comparable background checks, such as the 
Hazardous  Materials  Endorsement  (HME)  and  the  Merchant  Mariner  Document 
(MMD). However, what procedures have you put in place to ensure that individuals 
who  have  received  a  TWIC  do  not  have  to  undergo  and  pay  for  redundant  back-
ground checks when applying for a HME or MMD? 

Answer. The Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) process, fee structure, and 
contract  vehicles  were  implemented  in  January  2005  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
the  USA  PATRIOT  Act  of  2001  (Public  Law  107–56).  Presently  there  is  no  mecha-
nism  or  ability  to  reduce  this  redundancy  for  HME  drivers  within  the  confines  of 
the present fee rule and contractual vehicles. The Transportation Security Adminis-
tration  is  in  the  process  of  developing  a  new  fee  rule,  as  well  as  a  new  acquisition, 
that  will  take  this  issue  into  account  and  will  more  fully  align  the  HME  check,  as 
well as future threat assessment programs, with that of the Transportation Worker 
Identification Credential. The intention is to reduce the burden on multiple creden-
tial holders to the greatest extent possible. 

With respect to the MMD, TSA and Coast Guard are in discussions regarding the 
details of this issue. As you know Coast Guard is moving to a consolidated Merchant 
Mariner  Card  (MMC)  and  expects  to  recognize  the  TWIC  as  the  identity  document 
for  merchant  mariners.  Coast  Guard  will  not  charge  mariners  a  duplicative  fee  for 
the same requirement already fulfilled under TWIC. 

Question 7. TSA originally expected TWIC enrollments to begin at the Port of Wil-
mington  by  March  28,  2007—the  effective  date  of  the  TWIC  rule.  However,  enroll-
ments  did  not  begin  on  this  date  as  planned.  What  is  the  reason  for  the  delay  and 
when does TSA plan to begin enrolling workers at the port? 

Answer.  It  is  imperative  that  enrollments  begin  as  soon  as  possible,  and  TSA  is 
working  diligently  to  that  end.  At  the  same  time  our  highest  priority  is  to  ensure 
that  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  enrollment  and 
credential issuance process is as efficient and trouble-free for the first worker as for 
those who will follow. TSA expects to begin enrollment in the Fall of 2007, but that 
is subject to our ongoing, rigorous assessment of the TWIC system. 

TWIC  is  a  sophisticated  system  powered  by  state-of-the-art  technologies  and  we 
are  focused  on  a  rigorous  program  to  ‘‘flight  test’’  TWIC  before  it  is  rolled  out  to 
the ports. 

The TWIC network includes technology components covering five important areas: 
• The  Pre-Enrollment  website  component  allows  workers  to  schedule  appoint-
ments  and  provide  biographic  information  ahead  of  time  to  make  enrollment 
easier. 

• The  Enrollment  workstation  component  captures  a  worker’s  biometric  and  bio-
graphic  information  and  submits  the  information  for  completing  the  Security 
Threat Assessment (STA). 

• The TWIC system includes components that route applicant information for the 
STA,  store  data,  conduct  data  integrity  checks,  and  manage  status  on  TWIC 
cards.

69 

• The  Screening  Gateway  component  is  a  TSA  enterprise  asset  that  facilitates 
STA’s, working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Citizenship and Immi-
gration Services, and TSA’s Colorado Springs Operations Center. 

• Finally, the Card Production component electronically loads an applicant’s infor-

mation onto a TWIC smart card and then physically produces the card. 

All the internal moving parts must work together, to conduct accurate and timely 
security  threat  assessments.  We  recognize  that  TWIC  will  affect  both  businesses 
and port workers and a top priority is making sure the program does not negatively 
impact commerce or people’s livelihoods. 

Question  8.  How  does  TSA  plan  to  meet  the  requirement  of  the  SAFE  Port  Act 
that  TWIC  be  implemented  at  the  10  highest  risk  ports  by  July  1,  2007?  How  does 
TSA  interpret  the  term  ‘‘implemented’’  in  this  requirement?  What  challenges  do 
TSA  and  Lockheed  Martin  face  in  meeting  this  and  other  time  frames  in  the  Act? 
When  does  TSA  plan  to  set  specific  dates  requiring  TWIC  to  be  used  at  specific 
ports? 

Answer.  It  is  imperative  that  enrollments  begin  as  soon  as  possible,  and  TSA  is 
working  diligently  to  that  end.  At  the  same  time  our  highest  priority  is  to  ensure 
that  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  enrollment  and 
credential issuance process is as efficient and trouble-free for the first worker as for 
those who will follow. TSA expects to begin enrollment in the Fall of 2007, but that 
is subject to our ongoing, rigorous assessment of the TWIC system. Our highest pri-
ority  is  to  ensure  that  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC) 
enrollment  and  credential  issuance  process  is  as  efficient  and  trouble-free  for  the 
first worker as for those that follow. It is our intention to meet the remaining dead-
lines  set  forth  in  the  SAFE  Port  Act.  The  Coast  Guard  will  establish  compliance 
dates by Captain of the Port zones after the base population has been enrolled and 
received  their  TWICs.  This  date  will  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  at  least 
ninety days before compliance is required in each Captain of the Port zone. 

Question  9.  What  oversight  mechanisms  is  TSA  using  to  ensure  that  all  require-
ments of the TWIC enrollment contract are met? What specific steps does TSA plan 
to take to verify contract performance data provided by Lockheed Martin? 

Answer. The current contract is performance based with a defined Quality Assur-
ance  Surveillance  Plan  with  defined  Acceptable  Quality  Levels  (AQLs).  An  award 
fee structure is also in place to provide incentives for improved performance as well 
as  disincentives  should  the  contractor  not  meet  the  AQLs.  Performance  Manage-
ment  Reviews  are  being  conducted  monthly.  In  addition,  there  will  be  periodic  site 
visits  to  enrollment  centers  to  validate  and  verify  reported  performance  data.  As  a 
further oversight measure, TSA has engaged an IV&V contractor to review technical 
deliverables.  TSA  plans  to  continue  the  IV&V  contract  as  the  program  moves  for-
ward. 

Question 10. Mr. Hawley’s statement indicates that the Lockheed Martin contract 
requires adaptive planning, metrics, and changes. Can you please explain what you 
mean by this statement? 

Answer.  Lockheed  Martin  is  contractually  required  to  support  the  enrollment  of 
the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  population  nationwide.  To  sat-
isfy this requirement Lockheed Martin has developed a flexible deployment strategy 
to take into account the need to respond to enrollment surges, a mobile population, 
and enrollment facility options. The contract clearly defines Acceptable Quality Lev-
els  within  the  Quality  Assurance  Surveillance  Plan  with  which  Lockheed  Martin 
must adhere. The contract vehicle provides the Transportation Security Administra-
tion with the flexibility to add enrollment capability as the program is implemented. 
Question 11. When does TSA plan to begin the pilot program to test TWIC access 
control  technologies?  What  specific  technologies  does  TSA  plan  to  test  during  the 
pilot? 

Answer.  The  first  two  pilot  locations  have  been  awarded  grant  funding—Ports  of 
LA  (POLA)  and  Long  Beach  (POLB).  Additional  locations  will  be  selected  from  the 
grantees in the latest round of Port Security Grants. We have finalized the coopera-
tive agreement with POLB, POLA will finalize shortly. We are developing the com-
prehensive  test  and  evaluation  plan  and  expect  POLA  and  POLB  to  begin  working 
with  terminal  operators  to  identify  the  right  locations  for  TWIC  readers  and  start 
taking metrics for currents operations. 

The actual readers will begin testing after finalization of the contactless biometric 
authentication  specification  that  will  be  used  has  been  published,  and  industry  has 
developed  the  necessary  card  reader  equipment.  Planning  for  this  project  has  been 
underway since December 2006.

TSA  plans  to  test  contactless  biometric  authentication  technology  that  meets  the 
requirements  of  the  TWIC  reader  specification  in  a  variety  of  maritime  operational 
scenarios (container, bulk, petroleum, and passenger terminals; and vessels), as well 
as in different geographic regions and climates. The program has been working with 
other DHS entities (S&T Directorate, USCG, G&T, SCO) and the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology to develop the tests to assure baseline performance for 
this  technology.  TSA  is  also  collaborating  with  the  Space  and  Naval  Warfare  Sys-
tems Command who will conduct environmental and ruggedness testing. 

Question  12.  Does  TSA  plan  to  measure  the  impact  that  the  TWIC  program  will 
have  on  the  flow  of  maritime  commerce  during  the  pilot  program?  If  so,  how  does 
TSA plan to do this? How will TSA ensure effective communication and coordination 
with maritime industry stakeholders during implementation of TWIC? 

Answer.  Obtaining  current  ‘‘as  is’’  state  and  comparing  that  to  the  ‘‘to  be’’  state 
utilizing Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) card readers is the 
primary  focus  of  the  pilot.  The  pilot  Test  and  Evaluation  Master  Plan  (TEMP)  will 
address areas to be tested, required metrics, and test responsibilities. The Transpor-
tation  Security  Administration  anticipates  completing  the  TEMP  this  summer. 
Stakeholders will continue to be apprised of the deployment status through regular 
meetings of the TWIC Stakeholder Communications Committee (TSCC) and our par-
ticipation  in  various  conferences,  meetings,  and  briefings.  The  TSCC  is  comprised 
of  stakeholder  representatives  from  labor,  ports,  vessels,  and  other  industries  that 
will be impacted by TWIC. 

Question 13. What steps are TSA and Lockheed Martin taking to identify the en-
tire  population  affected  by  the  TWIC  rule  and  educate  this  population  on  their  re-
sponsibilities for enrolling in the TWIC program? 

Answer. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Lockheed Martin 
have  implemented  a  robust,  multi-faceted  outreach  and  communications  process  to 
identify  and  educate  the  population  affected  by  the  Transportation  Worker  Identi-
fication  Credential  (TWIC).  This  strategy  includes  regular  meetings  of  the  TWIC 
Stakeholder  Communications  Committee  comprised  of  stakeholder  representatives 
from  labor,  ports,  vessels,  and  other  industries  that  will  be  impacted  by  TWIC  and 
a  Lockheed  Martin  TWIC  field  organization  that  is  in  contact  with  local  Coast 
Guard  Captains  of  the  Port,  Port  Authorities,  major  port  officials,  industry,  and 
labor representatives. 

The  Transportation  Security  Administration  and  the  Coast  Guard  are  also 
leveraging their extensive relationships with affected stakeholders from both indus-
try  and  labor  that  have  been  developed  over  years  of  cooperation  in  the  transpor-
tation sector. 

Question  14.  Why  did  the  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  reject  adopting  the  Inter-
national  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  standard?  Will  the  TWIC  be  designed 
to be interoperable with the ICAO standard? If no, why? 

Answer.  In  developing  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential 
(TWIC),  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  considered  a  wide  variety  of 
document  standards.  The  starting  point  is  the  program’s  requirements  and  fun-
damentally  TWIC  was  developed  as  a  secure  identity  document  for  physical  access, 
pursuant to Congressional mandates. It is not a travel document that would be rec-
ognized internationally. 

It is important that credentials issued to U.S. Federal standards be interoperable 
with  the  TWIC  and  across  the  U.S.  transportation  system.  Therefore,  to  achieve 
maximum  interoperability  with  other  programs,  TWIC  follows  Federal  Government 
standards  for  biometric  credentials  which  are  contained  in  Federal  Information 
Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) and the underlying Federal standard for Minu-
tia  fingerprint  templates  contained  in  the  American  National  Standards  Institute 
publication  378.  The  industry  expects  the  FIPS  201  standard  to  be  the  primary 
standard across such operations into the future. 

Question  15.  What  assurance  does  TSA  have  that  the  agency  is  prepared  to  han-
dle  the  volume  of  workers  that  may  appeal  the  result  of  the  threat  assessment  or 
those  that  may  request  a  waiver  if  they  do  not  meet  the  eligibility  requirements? 
Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  is  leveraging  time- 
tested processes and procedures that have been developed and implemented success-
fully  in  programs  such  as  the  Hazmat  Threat  Assessment  Program.  In  the  Hazmat 
program,  security  threat  assessments  are  conducted  on  commercial  truck  drivers 
seeking  to  obtain,  renew,  or  transfer  a  hazardous  materials  endorsement  on  their 
state  issued  commercial  driver’s  license.  The  Hazmat  program  has  been  operating 
successfully since January 2005 and has received over 550,000 applications via a na-
tionwide system of TSA contracted enrollment stations and state licensing agencies. 
TSA  has  received  waiver  and  appeal  requests  on  approximately  1.5  percent  of  this

71 

population. The standard operating procedures and policies for adjudications and re-
dress have been proven successful. TSA has an existing contract in place to support 
adjudications including the waiver and appeal process. This contract is scalable and 
can surge to meet the demands of TWIC. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY 

Question. Millions of dollars have been spent and multiple delays have been expe-
rienced  with  the  Transportation  Security  Administration’s  (TSA)  Registered  Trav-
eler  (RT),  Secure  Flight,  and  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential 
(TWIC) programs. Should TSA follow the path it took with RT and allow the private 
sector  to  run  these  programs?  What  assurances  can  you  give  that  TSA  will  be  able 
to execute and sustain these types of programs? 

Answer.  While  there  are  significant  differences  in  the  statutory  language  man-
dating  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  and  Secure 
Flight and the language and intent concerning Registered Traveler (RT) the Trans-
portation Security Administration (TSA) believes that all three programs cannot be 
implemented without significant input from the private sector. 

In  the  case  of  RT,  TSA  was  provided  broad  discretion  to  design  and  implement 
the  program.  The  RT  Interoperability  Pilot  was  designed  to  test  the  public-private 
partnership  and  to  encourage  innovation  in  the  market  place.  At  the  same  time, 
there are certain program activities that are inherently governmental. TSA directly 
administers those functions, such as setting program security and compliance stand-
ards and completing the security threat assessment on RT applicants. 

Unlike RT, the Secure Flight and the TWIC programs are based on specific legis-
lative mandates. For Secure Flight, TSA has been directed to assume the watch list 
matching  currently  performed  by  aircraft  operators.  Furthermore,  the  Maritime 
Transportation  Security  Act  as  amended  by  the  SAFE  Port  Act  requires  the  Sec-
retary of Homeland Security to issue a biometric credential (TWIC) and conduct se-
curity threat assessments on individuals who have unescorted access to secure areas 
of maritime facilities and vessels. As a result, Secure Flight and TWIC are centrally 
managed  by  the  Federal  Government  to  assure  security,  privacy,  interoperability, 
and enforcement. 

Nevertheless, TSA has sought significant input from the private sector to develop 
these programs. For TWIC, TSA has requested the National Maritime Security Ad-
visory Committee, with representation from the stakeholder community and creden-
tial reader manufacturers, to recommend standards for use for a contactless creden-
tial  reading  solution.  Secure  Flight  is  being  developed  with  direct  input  from  the 
airline  industry  and  is  responding  directly  to  requests  for  a  single  DHS  interface 
to air carriers. 

TSA  recognizes  that  both  programs  have  faced  tremendous  challenges  in  moving 
toward implementation. Both involve significant IT investments and strong program 
management. TSA has taken steps to address critical program management require-
ments,  instilling  discipline  into  the  process  for  both  TWIC  and  Secure  Flight,  and 
is positioning itself to execute and sustain these programs. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY 

Question 1. How many workers nationwide are expected to need TWIC cards? Can 
you tell me what estimates TSA intends to use for the number of workers requiring 
TWIC  cards  at  the  Port  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  and  whether  sufficient  re-
sources will be available to provide these cards in a timely and efficient way? 

Answer. The Transportation Security Administration estimated 750,000 transpor-
tation  workers  would  require  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credentials 
(TWICs) to meet the mandates of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. 
Of that total, approximately 60,000 were estimated to be within the Port Authority 
of New York and New Jersey. The TWIC contractor is responsible for ensuring suffi-
cient  resources  are  in  place  to  conduct  timely  and  efficient  enrollments  and  card 
issuance  during  the  initial  enrollment  period.  The  contractor  has  flexibility  to  add 
or re-adjust assets as required to ensure adequate resources are in place to provide 
these cards in a timely and efficient manner. 

Question  1a.  Is  the  number  of  enrollment  stations  based  upon  the  affected  popu-
lation estimates published in the TWIC final rule? When will you and the contractor 
determine where the estimated 130 enrollment centers will be located? 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

72 

Answer. The number of enrollment workstations in each port is based on a num-
ber  of  factors  including  the  population  estimate  for  that  port,  the  geographic  size 
of  the  port,  and  the  duration  of  the  initial  enrollment  period  for  that  port.  The 
Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  contractor,  in  cooperation  with  the 
Transportation  Security  Administration  and  the  Coast  Guard,  is  in  the  process  of 
evaluating each port to determine the number and location of enrollment sites. 

Question  1b.  What  steps  do  you  plan  to  take  if  your  population  estimates  are 

found to be too conservative? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration,  the  Coast  Guard,  and  the 
Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  contractor  will  continue  to 
communicate  with  local  stakeholders  and  monitor  the  enrollment  population  to  en-
sure adequate resources are deployed to enroll the affected population in an effective 
manner. The TWIC contractor is responsible for ensuring sufficient resources are in 
place  to  conduct  timely  and  efficient  enrollments  and  card  issuance  during  the  ini-
tial  enrollment  period.  The  contractor  has  the  flexibility  to  add  or  re-adjust  assets 
as  required  to  ensure  adequate  resources  are  in  place  to  provide  these  cards  in  a 
timely and efficient manner. 

Additionally,  the  TWIC  contract  contains  a  Quality  Assurance  Surveillance  Plan 
with  Acceptable  Quality  Levels  for  enrollment  and  wait  times  against  which  the 
contractor will be measured. 

Question  1c.  If  population  estimates  are  considered  too  conservative,  will  TSA  be 

required to modify the contract with Lockheed Martin? 

Answer. Modifications to the contract should not be required. The Transportation 
Worker  Identification  Credential  contract  is  performance  based  and  the  prime  con-
tractor  receives  a  portion  of  the  user  fee  for  each  transaction.  Included  in  the  con-
tract are award incentives for the contractor to exceed enrollment projections. 

Question  2.  Given  that  a  transportation  worker  has  to  appear  at  an  enrollment 
center  at  least  two  times  (enrollment  and  card  issuance),  how  is  the  TSA  going  to 
ensure  the  level  of  staffing  and  processing  times  (15  minute  processing)  are  suffi-
cient to minimize the impact on industry and the flow of commerce? 

Answer. The Transportation Security Administration will monitor the contractor’s 
performance  through  site  visits,  customer  surveys,  and  program  management  re-
views. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential contract includes incen-
tive  and  disincentive  provisions  for  contractor  performance.  The  processing  time, 
which is highly dependent on the contractor’s staffing level, will be a significant fac-
tor  in  the  contractor  performance  evaluation.  Also,  the  system  incorporates  a  pre- 
enrollment  website  component  that  allows  workers  to  schedule  appointments  and 
provide  biographic  information  ahead  of  time  to  make  the  enrollment  process  more 
efficient. 

Question 3. If the initial enrollment is expected to take an extended period of time 
in  a  particular  port  (i.e.,  9–12  months  in  NY/NJ),  how  are  the  TSA  and  the  USCG 
going to ensure that transportation workers avail themselves to the enrollment proc-
ess  throughout  the  entire  period?  Inevitably  many  people  will  put  off  their  enroll-
ment until shortly before the enforcement date. How is the contractor going to han-
dle  the  surge  in  volume  that  is  expected  30  days  prior  to  enforcement  in  a  given 
port? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration,  the  Coast  Guard,  and  the 
Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  contractor  are  working  to 
develop effective outreach and communications with stakeholders, including employ-
ers,  unions,  and  advocacy  groups,  to  generate  a  steady  flow  of  enrollment  through-
out  the  enrollment  period.  The  TWIC  contractor  is  responsible  for  ensuring  suffi-
cient  resources  are  in  place  to  conduct  timely  and  efficient  enrollments  and  card 
issuance  during  the  initial  enrollment  period.  The  contractor  has  the  flexibility  to 
add or re-adjust assets as required to ensure adequate resources are in place to pro-
vide  these  cards  in  a  timely  and  efficient  manner.  Additionally,  the  TWIC  contract 
includes award incentives for the contractor to exceed enrollment projections. Some 
responsibility,  however,  must  still  fall  on  facilities,  employers,  and  the  transpor-
tation  workers  themselves  to  enroll  in  time  to  ensure  they  can  be  eligible  for 
unescorted  access  to  secure  areas  before  the  compliance  date  established  for  each 
port. 

Question 4. It is my understanding that TSA has suggested taking resources from 
the  Port  Security  Grant  program  to  pay  for  the  TWIC  pilot  project.  Why  didn’t  the 
President’s request separate funding for the pilot project? 

Answer.  Terminal  and  vessel  operators  are  responsible  for  access  control  into 
their  facilities.  The  use  of  Port  Security  Grant  funds  for  the  purchase  of  card  read-
ers  and  associated  infrastructure  to  conduct  the  pilot  test  is  appropriate  since  the 
terminal and vessel operators will be able to keep the equipment and access control

system improvements to comply with the Transportation Worker Identification Cre-
dential  reader  rule  once  it  is  effective.  In  addition,  much  of  the  work  conducted 
through  the  test  would  have  to  be  completed  by  the  ports  and  facilities  or  vessels 
at  their  locations,  in  order  to  implement  the  TWIC  reader  requirements.  We  also 
believe that this use increases the overall level of security measures in place. 

Question  5.  I  don’t  expect  this  TWIC  program  to  be  completed  anytime  soon.  In 
the  meantime,  when  will  you  complete  the  terror  watch-list  checks  for  port  truck 
drivers,  as  you  were  required  to  do  in  the  SAFE  Port  Act,  and  as  you  have  done 
for other workers with access to secure areas of ports? Has FMCSA provided a com-
plete  list  of  Commercial  Drivers  License  holders  to  you?  If  not,  how  will  you  pro-
ceed? 

Answer. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to meet these 
requirements  through  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  en-
rollments and security threat assessments which will begin at the conclusion of our 
TWIC system performance testing. TWIC implementation will capture this informa-
tion and make the vetting process go smoothly without the need to undertake a sec-
ond rulemaking. 

Section  125  of  the  Security  and  Accountability  for  Every  Port  Act  (Public  Law 
109–347) addresses a population on which no government entity, association, or in-
dustry organization maintains information. Generally, each port Terminal Operator 
has  contracts  with  a  number  of  transportation  companies  that  provide  drivers  and 
trucks  to  transport  containers  from  secure  areas  to  staging  areas.  Neither  the  Ter-
minal  Operator  nor  the  trucking  companies  know  which  drivers  may  enter  a  port 
on any given day or at all. Most trucking companies do not have all of the informa-
tion necessary to successfully complete the vetting on each of their drivers to submit 
to  TSA.  There  are  over  500,000  trucking  companies,  many  of  which  are  independ-
ently owned and operated and tend to move to where the business is with no single 
company affiliation. 

Question  6.  In  a  joint  USCG/TSA  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  that  was  pub-
lished  in  May  2006,  a  contact  reader  with  pin  technology  was  proposed.  Industry 
vehemently opposed this technology solution because of the negative impact it would 
have on terminal efficiency. Where does the TSA now stand on this issue? 

Answer.  Based  on  comments  received  during  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking 
process  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  bifurcated  the  rule.  The 
first rule that was published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2007, does not 
impose  the  requirement  on  owners/operators  to  purchase,  install,  or  maintain  card 
readers.  A  second  rulemaking  will  address  the  card  readers.  The  public  will  have 
ample  opportunity  to  comment  on  this  second  rulemaking.  TSA  and  the  Coast 
Guard  will  consider  all  comments  when  determining  what  technology  or  processes 
are required to ensure that security of information and privacy is protected, as well 
as operational efficiency, in developing a final technology solution. 

In March 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard invited public comment on a draft Transpor-
tation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) biometric reader specification and a 
draft  TWIC  contactless  smart  cart  application  recommended  by  the  National  Mari-
time Security Advisory Committee that did not require use of a PIN. The final read-
er  specification  is  pending  a  review  of  comments  received  from  the  public  notice. 
TSA  then  plans  to  test  contactless  biometric  authentication  technology  that  meets 
the  requirements  of  the  TWIC  reader  specification  in  a  variety  of  maritime  oper-
ational scenarios (container, bulk, petroleum, and passenger terminals; and vessels), 
as  well  as  in  different  geographic  regions  and  climates.  TSA,  with  assistance  from 
other Department of Homeland Security components, is developing a comprehensive 
Test and Evaluation Master Plan which we anticipate completing this summer. TSA 
has  also  been  working  with  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  to 
develop  laboratory  performance  tests  to  assure  baseline  performance  for  this  tech-
nology,  as  well  as  the  Space  and  Naval  Warfare  Systems  Command  who  will  con-
duct environmental and ruggedness testing. 

Question  7.  The  SAFE  Port  Act  requires  the  TSA  to  establish  a  pilot  program  to 
test  the  card  reader  technology  at  5  geographically  distinct  port  locations  within  6 
months of enactment. When and where will these pilot projects commence and how 
long are they funded? 

Answer.  The  first  two  pilot  locations  have  been  awarded  grant  funding—Ports  of 
LA  (POLA)  and  Long  Beach  (POLB).  Additional  locations  will  be  selected  from  the 
grantees in the latest round of Port Security Grants. We have finalized the coopera-
tive agreement with POLB, POLA will finalize shortly. We are developing the com-
prehensive  test  and  evaluation  plan  and  expect  POLA  and  POLB  to  begin  working 
with  terminal  operators  to  identify  the  right  locations  for  TWIC  readers  and  start 
taking metrics for currents operations.

The actual readers will begin testing after finalization of the contactless biometric 
authentication  specification  that  will  be  used  has  been  published,  and  industry  has 
developed  the  necessary  card  reader  equipment.  Planning  for  this  project  has  been 
underway since December 2006. 

TSA  plans  to  test  contactless  biometric  authentication  technology  that  meets  the 
requirements  of  the  TWIC  reader  specification  in  a  variety  of  maritime  operational 
scenarios (container, bulk, petroleum, and passenger terminals; and vessels), as well 
as  in  different  geographic  regions  and  climates.  The  duration  of  the  pilot  tests  will 
be such that the card readers will be tested under various environmental and oper-
ational conditions, although the duration has not yet been finalized. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY 

Question 1. While I appreciate TSA’s willingness to further study the requirement 
directing  each  towing  vessel  to  carry  a  card  reader,  I  remain  concerned  about  the 
effect  of  this  requirement  on  the  maritime  industry,  particularly  its  small  busi-
nesses.  As  you  know,  there  is  significant  opposition  to  requiring  card  readers  on 
every towing vessel. Given that crew sizes on tug boats reportedly run between four 
and  ten  mariners,  and  each  of  those  mariners  is  well  known  to  other  mariners  on 
the tug, as well as management, therefore making any intruder obvious, do you be-
lieve  a  workable  compromise  could  be  reached,  such  as  only  requiring  card  readers 
on vessels employing ten or more mariners? 

Answer. The Coast Guard will be evaluating and considering multiple types of op-
erations  and  scenarios  as  the  proposed  requirements  for  the  second  Transportation 
Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  rule  are  developed.  When  determining 
reader  applicability,  crew  size  and  vessel  type  are  very  likely  to  be  considered  in 
addition to risk. 

Question  2.  The  TWIC  application  process  remains  burdensome  on  workers  and 
the  industries  depending  on  them.  Easier  access  to  TWIC  cards  once  granted  may 
help relieve some of this burden without causing undue security concerns. Many are 
concerned  about  the  cumbersome  process  to  apply  for  a  TWIC  card,  including  the 
long distances some workers will be required to travel to obtain a TWIC card. This 
is  especially  true  for  those  in  the  long  haul  trucking  industry  who  may  end  up  ap-
plying for their card at one enrollment center, but due to the nature of their employ-
ment  may  be  far  from  that  center  by  the  time  the  card  is  ready.  In  your  opinion, 
would  allowing  applicants  to  designate  that  cards  be  returned  to  a  different  enroll-
ment  center  than  where  they  originally  applied  or  alternatively  including  a  mecha-
nism  to  mail  cards  to  an  applicant’s  home  or  office  be  realistic  fixes  for  this  prob-
lem? If not, what do you propose as an alternative? 

Answer. Shipping a Transportation Worker Identification Credential to an enroll-
ment center other than the one at which enrollment took place was considered dur-
ing the planning stages of the program. Mailing cards directly to the applicant was 
also considered. To make system changes to accommodate these alternatives at this 
time would be costly and could further delay implementation. Mailing cards directly 
to  the  individual  raised  security  concerns  as  the  Transportation  Security  Adminis-
tration  (TSA)  would  not  be  able  to  ensure  the  individual  receiving  the  card  was  in 
fact the individual that applied for the card. Although these methods were excluded 
as  part  of  our  original  business  plan,  TSA  may  reconsider  these  options  as  experi-
ence is gained with the current system and processes in order to reduce the burden 
on the affected population. 

Question  3.  The  costs  associated  with  TWIC  may  be  a  barrier  for  some  workers 
and  businesses.  While  I  understand  those  costs  may  compare  favorably  with  other 
card  fees,  they  remain  a  burden  for  the  temporary,  seasonal  labor  in  the  maritime 
industry.  Of  particular  concern  is  the  fact  that  an  applicant  must  pay  for  the  full 
price of the application up front, leaving those applicants who are denied cards pay-
ing  for  the  production  of  cards  they  do  not  receive.  One  potential  solution  may  be 
not  to  reduce  the  overall  costs,  but  the  schedule  on  which  they  are  paid.  In  your 
opinion,  would  it  be  possible  for  TSA  to  charge  only  for  the  cost  of  processing  the 
application and the security assessment up front, with the balance to be paid should 
a card be granted? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  believes  the  current 
process of payment and fee collection provides the best value to the total population 
and  limits  the  overall  cost  of  the  credential.  While  workers  ultimately  denied  a 
Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  may  pay  for  the  card  pro-
duction  and  issuance  portion  of  program  costs,  they  benefit  from  having  all  appli-
cants  sharing  equally  in  the  cost  of  the  process.  Workers  whose  criminal  history

75 

would otherwise result in denial of a TWIC may request a waiver through the TSA 
redress process and review by an administrative law judge. Adopting a position that 
TWIC  applicants  should  only  pay  for  the  services  they  directly  receive  could  result 
in considerable costs to those applicants utilizing the redress process. 

Question  4.  The  goal  of  the  TWIC  program  is  to  strengthen  the  security  of  our 
transportation  system,  starting  with  the  implementation  of  a  pilot  without  unin-
tended  consequences.  Unfortunately,  a  host  of  issues  have  plagued  the  successful 
implementation of the pilot, including an incomplete management plan to date, lack 
of contract accountability, and ever-increasing costs to implement the program. I am 
concerned  that  if  we  don’t  fix  these  problems  soon,  we  jeopardize  the  health  of  our 
workforce, strength of our economy, and overall, security of our Nation. Given these 
are  just  some  of  the  implementation  issues  since  the  TWIC  pilot  was  first  author-
ized  in  2001,  please  describe  how  our  workforce  and  economy  has  been  indirectly 
impacted by these delays. 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  is  only 
going to improve what is currently a less than ideal situation in the maritime sector 
of  our  Nation’s  transportation  system.  The  maritime  workforce  does  not  currently 
have a common, secure, interoperable credential that can be used for nationwide ac-
cess to maritime facilities, as the TWIC is intended to provide. Workers may be re-
quired to purchase multiple credentials and undergo multiple background checks to 
gain  access  to  facilities  sometimes  even  within  the  same  state.  The  intent  of  the 
TWIC is to provide this capability in the form of a uniform identity credential based 
on a minimum Federal security standard and centralized processes that can replace 
the many credentials that may be required today. 

Question  5.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  TWIC  system  will  not  be  interoper-
able with international standards. I am concerned that without uniformity of inter-
national standards, non-U.S. crewman will be exempt from complying with our secu-
rity  provisions  when  entering  U.S.  ports.  Do  you  think  it  is  necessary  to  establish 
an uniform international ID standard? What is the agency’s plan to sync the TWIC 
system with the current biometric technology used by the United Nations and devel-
oped by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)? 

Answer.  Obtaining  current  ‘‘as  is’’  state  and  comparing  that  to  the  ‘‘to  be’’  state 
utilizing Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) card readers is the 
primary  focus  of  the  pilot.  The  pilot  Test  and  Evaluation  Master  Plan  (TEMP)  will 
address areas to be tested, required metrics, and test responsibilities. The Transpor-
tation  Security  Administration  anticipates  completing  the  TEMP  this  summer. 
Stakeholders will continue to be apprised of the deployment status through regular 
meetings of the TWIC Stakeholder Communications Committee (TSCC) and our par-
ticipation  in  various  conferences,  meetings,  and  briefings.  The  TSCC  is  comprised 
of  stakeholder  representatives  from  labor,  ports,  vessels,  and  other  industries  that 
will be impacted by TWIC. 

The  United  Nations  through  the  International  Labor  Organization  developed  a 
seafarer  credential  with  the  intention  of  endorsing  it  as  a  universally  recognized 
visa.  The  U.S.  supports  the  concept  of  raising  the  level  of  seafarer  document  secu-
rity  but  continues  to  have  some  concerns  about  the  ILO  document.  TSA  will  con-
tinue  to  monitor  international  developments  and  protocols  to  determine  what,  if 
any, benefits to the program they provide. 

Question  6.  The  enrollment  of  workers  at  the  Port  of  Seattle  was  scheduled  to 
begin  on  March  26.  When  and  by  what  means  did  TSA  notify  the  Port  that  the 
March 26 date would slip? What effort will TSA make to ensure the Port’s manage-
ment  is  fully  informed  of  the  new  schedule  for  TWIC  enrollment  when  it  becomes 
available? 

Has the TWIC contractor physically established a TWIC enrollment center for the 
Port  of  Seattle?  The  Port  estimates  that  approximately  100,000  individuals  will  re-
quire  a  TWIC.  How  many  enrollment  agents  does  the  contractor  intend  to  hire  to 
handle the number of individuals that will have to be enrolled? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  has  not  published  an 
official  enrollment  schedule  and  has  not  notified  the  Port  of  Seattle  when  enroll-
ments  will  commence  at  that  location.  TSA  and  Lockheed  Martin  commenced  a  ro-
bust, multi-faceted outreach and communications process to identify and educate the 
population  affected  by  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC). 
This  strategy  includes  regular  meetings  of  the  TWIC  Stakeholder  Communications 
Committee  comprised  of  stakeholder  representatives  from  labor,  ports,  vessels,  and 
other industries that will be impacted by TWIC and a Lockheed Martin TWIC field 
organization  that  is  in  contact  with  local  Coast  Guard  Captains  of  the  Port,  Port 
Authorities, major ports officials, industry, and labor representatives. Once TSA de-

76 

termines we are prepared to begin issuing notice on enrollment, this outreach effort 
will expand significantly. 

Lockheed Martin has met with Seattle maritime officials; however, specific Seattle 
enrollment  sites  have  not  been  established.  Lockheed  Martin  is  contractually  re-
quired  to  support  the  enrollment  of  the  TWIC  population  nationwide.  In  order  for 
them  to  satisfy  this  requirement  Lockheed  Martin  has  developed  a  flexible  deploy-
ment strategy to take into account the need to respond to enrollment surges, a mo-
bile population, and enrollment facility options. The contract clearly defines Accept-
able  Quality  Levels  within  the  Quality  Assurance  Surveillance  Plan  to  which  Lock-
heed  Martin  must  adhere.  The  contract  vehicle  provides  TSA  with  the  flexibility  to 
add enrollment capability as the program is implemented. 

Question  7.  The  SAFE  Port  Act  requires  TSA  to  conduct  a  pilot  program  to  test 
the business process, technological, and operational impacts of TWIC deployment at 
not fewer than five distinct geographic locations and to include vessels and facilities 
in these tests. What is the status of these pilot programs and the required testing? 
Answer.  Planning  for  the  pilot  programs  has  been  underway  since  December 
2006. A pilot test agreement has been reached with the Port of Long Beach and ap-
proval  of  an  agreement  with  the  Port  of  Los  Angeles  is  expected  in  the  next  few 
months. Discussions are also ongoing with the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey  to  finalize  their  participation.  TSA,  with  assistance  from  other  Department 
of Homeland Security components, is developing a comprehensive Test and Evalua-
tion  Master  Plan  which  we  anticipate  completing  this  summer.  TSA  has  also  been 
working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop labora-
tory  performance  tests  to  assure  baseline  performance  for  this  technology,  as  well 
as the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command who will conduct environmental 
and ruggedness testing. 

Question  7a.  When  and  where  will  the  first  full  scale  pilot  program  testing  of  an 

automated TWIC system be? 

Answer. The first Early Operational Assessment test will be conducted in conjunc-

tion with the Ports of LA and Long Beach this year. 

Question 7b. My understanding is that some early testing of TWIC prototypes was 
conducted  at  the  ports  in  Washington.  Will  TSA  be  conducting  any  further  testing 
of TWIC at these ports prior to requiring full deployment? 

Answer. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential prototype tests were 
conducted  in  three  geographic  areas:  Los  Angeles  and  Long  Beach;  Delaware  River 
Basin; and Florida. 

Question  7c.  Has  TSA  determined  all  five  locations  that  will  be  used  for  testing? 

If not, when do you expect to do so? 

Answer.  The  first  two  pilot  locations  have  been  awarded  grant  funding—Ports  of 
LA  (POLA)  and  Long  Beach  (POLB).  Additional  locations  will  be  selected  from  the 
grantees  in  the  latest  round  of  Port  Security  Grants.  Discussions  are  also  ongoing 
with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to finalize their participation 
and we are working with the American Waterways Operators Association to identify 
an appropriate participant for the towboat and tug boat industry. 

Question  7d.  What  is  the  required  error  rate  for  the  TWIC  card?  Can  you  please 
describe  the  scope  and  methodology  that  will  be  used  to  test  the  error  rate  of  the 
TWIC card? 

Answer. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential will be aligned with 
the  Federal  standards  for  government  credentials  contained  in  the  National  Insti-
tute  of  Standards  and  Technology’s  (NIST’s)  Federal  Information  Process  Standard 
201–1  and  associated  standards  such  as  those  in  NIST’s  Special  Publication  800– 
76.  800–76  specifies  a  false  rejection  rate  (FRR)  of  less  than  or  equal  to  1  percent 
and a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1 percent. The FRR is the percentage of incor-
rectly  rejected  valid  users.  The  FAR  is  the  percentage  of  imposters  incorrectly 
matched to a valid user’s biometric. 

The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA),  with  assistance  from  other 
Department  of  Homeland  Security  components,  is  developing  a  comprehensive  Test 
and Evaluation Master Plan which we anticipate completing this summer. TSA has 
also  been  working  with  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  to  de-
velop  laboratory  performance  tests  to  assure  baseline  performance  for  this  tech-
nology,  as  well  as  the  Space  and  Naval  Warfare  Systems  Command  who  will  con-
duct environmental and ruggedness testing. 

Question 7e. Were private sector representatives, such as terminal and vessel op-

erators, included in developing the scope and methodology for this testing? 

Answer.  TSA  has  used  comments  provided  in  response  to  the  TWIC  NPRM  pub-
lished  in  May  2006  as  well  as  its  work  with  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advi-

sory Committee in developing the scope of the pilot tests. We are working with the 
Ports  of  LA  and  Long  Beach  and  will  work  with  the  other  pilot  locations  as  well 
to incorporate their feedback. Specifically to testing parameters, the Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA), with assistance from other Department of Homeland 
Security  components,  is  developing  a  comprehensive  Test  and  Evaluation  Master 
Plan which we anticipate completing this summer. TSA has also been working with 
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  to  develop  laboratory  perform-
ance  tests  to  assure  baseline  performance  for  this  technology,  as  well  as  the  Space 
and Naval Warfare Systems Command who will conduct environmental and rugged-
ness testing. TSA will, at the appropriate time, seek operator input as the test plans 
are  developed  to  ensure  full  participation  from  stakeholders  and  a  robust  meaning-
ful pilot test is conducted. 

Question  8.  Your  agency,  along  with  the  Coast  Guard,  has  requested  comments 
on  the  TWIC  technology  specification  recommendations  developed  by  the  National 
Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee  (NMSAC).  I  understand  that  those  com-
ments  where  due  on  March  30  of  this  year.  Can  you  give  the  Committee  a  general 
overview of the comments received? 

Answer. Over thirty separate entities submitted comments to the questions posed 
in  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  Contactless  Bio-
metrics  Specification  Public  Notice  published  in  the  Federal  Register.  Entities  were 
predominantly  from  the  maritime  community  and  its  trade  associations  but  some 
represented  technology  companies  and  technology  trade  associations.  Generally  the 
commenters  praised  the  work  of  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Com-
mittee (NMSAC) TWIC Contactless Specification Workgroup. 

Commenters also generally agreed that a PIN was not a good idea for general use 
due  to  operational  concerns.  Others  believe  the  PIN  should  be  considered  only  if  it 
can  be  shown  not  to  affect  operations.  A  number  of  commenters  believe  the  impact 
of lost PINs would be burdensome to the TWIC users and to the program. 

Most  commenters  agreed  that  privacy  was  important  but  most  in  the  maritime 
industry did not have concerns that any measures were required to protect the pri-
vacy  of  biometric  fingerprint  templates.  On  the  other  hand,  most  in  the  technology 
industry  believe  that  biometric  fingerprint  templates  should  be  protected,  but  that 
the TWIC Privacy Key (TPK) scheme is sufficient to protect the template. 

A  number  of  maritime  commenters  carried  forward  their  concerns  about  PINs, 
encryption  of  fingerprint  biometric  templates  and  use  of  the  TPK  card  magnetic 
stripe  swipe  concept  as  having  potential  negative  impact  on  port  and  facility  oper-
ations.  Commenters  also  mentioned  that  the  pilot  tests  would  be  useful  for  identi-
fying  impacts  on  facility  and  vessel  operations.  Specifically,  commenters  were  con-
cerned  about  error  rates  that  might  impact  gate  throughput,  operation  during  ex-
treme  situations,  allowing  cleaning  and  vending  personnel  into  facilities  without  a 
TWIC, the effect of TWIC at various Marine Security levels. 

Commenters generally agreed that TWIC would have a large impact on currently 
deployed personnel access control systems (PACS) if they were to be integrated and 
duplicative if they are not. 

A  number  of  commenters  reiterated  their  endorsement  of  the  NMSAC  rec-
ommendation  as  being  the  one  that  would  have  minimal  impact  on  the  cost  of  port 
security operations. Commenters with PACS were concerned with integrating TWIC 
into  their  operation,  especially  the  impact  of  the  recommendation  that  includes 
encryption of biometrics and possible need of wiring upgrades. Commenters were in-
terested  in  impacts  on  both  acquisition/installation  and  operational  costs.  Com-
menters  without  current  PACS  were  concerned  that  TWIC  would  require  PACS  to 
be procured, installed, and maintained. 

Almost  universally  commenters  agreed  that  a  Qualified  Products  List  should  be 

developed. 

Question 8a. When do you expect to complete a review of the requested comments 
and  provide  a  proposed  rule  on  the  technology  that  will  be  required  to  be  deployed 
at our Nation’s port to support the TWIC? 

Answer. The Transportation Security Administration’s goal is to publish the final 
specification  within  the  coming  months.  The  Transportation  Worker  Identification 
Credential  rule  requiring  readers  will  follow  the  notice  and  comment  rulemaking 
process after initial pilot test results have been collected and reviewed. 

Question  8b.  How  is  the  development  and  deployment  of  the  technology  behind 

TWIC being coordinated with the testing required by the SAFE Port Act? 

Answer.  The  pilot  tests  TSA  is  planning  pursuant  to  the  SAFE  Port  Act,  will  in-
form  the  follow-on  rulemaking  to  require  deployment  of  TWIC  readers.  The  Trans-
portation  Security  Administration  (TSA),  with  assistance  from  other  Department  of 
Homeland Security components, is developing a comprehensive Test and Evaluation

Master Plan which we anticipate completing this summer. TSA has also been work-
ing  with  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  to  develop  laboratory 
performance tests to assure baseline performance for this technology, as well as the 
Space  and  Naval  Warfare  Systems  Command  who  will  conduct  environmental  and 
ruggedness testing. 

Question 8c. When do you expect to publish a final rule on the technology of TWIC 

technology and will it be published before your agency completes the testing? 

Answer. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) rule requir-
ing readers will follow the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) process after ini-
tial  pilot  test  results  have  been  collected  and  reviewed.  The  Coast  Guard  and  the 
Transportation  Security  Administration  have  begun  work  on  the  TWIC  II  NPRM 
and expect to publish it in early 2008. 

Question  9.  Regarding  the  testing  at  the  Ports  of  Los  Angeles  and  Long  Beach: 
I understand that the Ports where awarded Maritime Security Grants to help cover 
the  cost  of  testing  and  implementation.  These  grants  in  general,  require  the  ports 
to  provide  matching  state  and  local  funding  in  the  amount  of  25  percent.  I  am  told 
that  your  agency  is  requiring  the  full  25  percent  match  in  the  case  of  both  testing 
and  implementation.  Do  you  agree  that  the  development  and  testing  of  the  TWIC 
technology standards is a Federal security responsibility? If not, why not? 

Answer.  Yes,  although  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  has  sought, 
and  continues  to  seek,  input  from  affected  industry  stakeholders  to  ensure  security 
goals are achieved while minimizing the effect on commerce and people. In addition, 
the pilot test TSA is conducting pursuant to the SAFE Port Act will facilitate imple-
mentation at the participating locations. As such, they are critical partners. 

Question 9a. Can you explain the reasoning behind requiring select state and local 
governments  to  match  Federal  funding  for  testing  a  system  that  will  be  deployed 
nationwide? 

Answer. Federal funding provides for equipment and infrastructure improvements 
that will remain in place during and after the Transportation Worker Identification 
Credential  (TWIC)  pilot  test  has  concluded  and  will  facilitate  compliance  with  the 
TWIC card reader rule. Therefore, it is appropriate for owners and operators to fund 
a portion of the infrastructure. 

Question  9b.  Will  your  agency  be  requiring  the  other  ports  at  which  you  will  be 
conducting pilot program testing to provide matching funding for the testing phase? 
Answer.  Yes,  all  ports  that  participate  in  the  pilot  program  using  grant  funding 

will be required to provide matching funds pursuant to the grant guidance. 

Question 9c. How much total funding are state and local governments going to be 

expected to pay for testing the purposed TWIC technology? 

Answer. The total amount of funds expended by state and local governments will 
depend  on  the  amount  awarded  and  utilized  for  equipment  and  infrastructure  im-
provements by those ports and facilities participating in the test. 

Question 9d. What happens if the testing proves the system that is developed does 
not  work?  Will  you  reimburse  state  and  local  governments  for  the  money  they  con-
tributed to testing? 

Answer. The fingerprint template biometric technology that will be used by Trans-
portation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) has been extensively tested both 
by  the  biometrics  industry  and  the  Federal  Government  (National  Institute  of 
Standards  and  Technology  and  General  Services  Administration)  and  is  in  use  in 
numerous applications. The primary question to be answered by the pilot test is not 
whether this technology works, but what the impact of requiring its use in the mari-
time  industry  will  be  where  current  regulations  only  require  a  visual  inspection  of 
identification.  As  noted  above,  facilities  will  be  the  beneficiaries  of  equipment  pur-
chases and infrastructure improvements; therefore, there are no plans to reimburse 
participants for funds expended for this purpose. 

Question  9e.  What  alternatives,  such  as  public-private  partnership  have  you  ex-

plored to get testing completed in a timely manner? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  pilot  testing,  and 
the specification development preceding the pilot test, is an example of a public-pri-
vate  partnership.  The  contactless  specification  published  for  public  comment  was 
recommended  by  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee  working 
group  in  partnership  with  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  and  the 
Coast  Guard.  Pilot  test  plans  will  be  developed  with  input  from  the  volunteer  par-
ticipants. 

Question 10. I understand that the terminal operators at the Ports of Los Angeles 
and  Long  Beach  already  maintain  a  database  of  over  9,000  transportation  workers 
(mostly truckers) that regularly call on the terminals and require unescorted access. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

Have  you  considered  using  this  existing  database  as  a  way  to  move  forward  with 
testing technology before prior to completing registration of port and transportation 
workers? If so, where does this effort stand? If not, why not? 

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  will  consider  all  op-
tions  for  pilot  testing  within  the  parameters  of  its  Testing  and  Evaluation  Master 
Plan. TSA intends to conduct end-to-end testing of the Transportation Worker Iden-
tification Credential (TWIC) system and it is unlikely an existing database contains 
the  fingerprints  needed  to  create  the  fingerprint  template  for  use  in  biometric 
matching.  Additionally,  during  prototype  testing,  TSA  attempted  to  use  existing 
databases  of  maritime  workers  to  expedite  enrollment  with  unsatisfactory  results. 
The  databases  contained  data  element  errors  (nick-names  instead  of  given  names, 
out  of  date  address  and  phone  information,  no  audit  trail  of  identification 
verification,  among  others)  and  technical  errors  in  formatting  that  were  difficult  to 
identify  and  resolve.  TSA  has  no  plans  to  rely  on  other  databases  for  enrollment 
information for actual TWICs or to issue test credentials. 

Question  11.  The  ports  in  my  State  of  Washington,  and  I  am  sure  elsewhere  as 
well,  can  not  afford  to  have  port  and  transportation  workers  denied  access  or  re-
peated delays in access due to faulty technology. Whatever technology is used to im-
plement  TWIC,  it  must  support  commercially  acceptable  error  rates,  processing 
times,  and  overall  reliability.  While  I  understand  your  agency  is  in  the  process  of 
reviewing  comments  on  the  TWIC  technology  standards  recommend  by  the 
NAMSAC,  I  would  like  to  know  what  steps  your  agency  is  taking  to  ensure  that 
any technology that is deployed or required to be deployed is error free and economi-
cally viable. 

Answer. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential will be aligned with 
the  Federal  standards  for  government  credentials  contained  in  the  National  Insti-
tute  of  Standards  and  Technology’s  (NIST’s)  Federal  Information  Process  Standard 
201–1  and  associated  standards  such  as  those  in  NIST’s  Special  Publication  800– 
76.  800–76  specifies  a  false  rejection  rate  (FRR)  of  less  than  or  equal  to  1  percent 
and a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1 percent. The FRR is the percentage of incor-
rectly  rejected  valid  users.  The  FAR  is  the  percentage  of  imposters  incorrectly 
matched to a valid user’s biometric. 

Planning for the pilot programs has been underway since December 2006. A pilot 
test  agreement  has  been  reached  with  the  Port  of  Long  Beach  and  approval  of  an 
agreement with the Port of Los Angeles is expected in the next few months. Discus-
sions are also ongoing with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to final-
ize  their  participation.  TSA,  with  assistance  from  other  Department  of  Homeland 
Security  components,  is  developing  a  comprehensive  Test  and  Evaluation  Master 
Plan which we anticipate completing this summer. TSA has also been working with 
the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  to  develop  laboratory  perform-
ance  tests  to  assure  baseline  performance  for  this  technology,  as  well  as  the  Space 
and Naval Warfare Systems Command who will conduct environmental and rugged-
ness testing. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY 

Question. In 2002, the State of Florida enacted a law requiring a Florida Uniform 
Ports Access Credential (FUPAC) in order to ensure the safety and security of Flor-
ida’s  twelve  public  seaports.  At  approximately  the  same  time,  Congress  passed  and 
the  President  signed  into  law  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  of  2002 
(MTSA), which contained many of the same goals. 

In  an  effort  to  harmonize  and  maximize  the  effectiveness  of  both  programs,  the 
State of Florida signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Transpor-
tation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  in  September  2003  to  design  and  implement 
a prototype Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) in the State of 
Florida.  The  goal  of  the  MOU  was  to  create  a  prototype  credential  that  could  meet 
both the state and Federal port security requirements. Since that time, Florida has 
been  the  only  state  to  reach  a  level  of  readiness  to  actually  implement  such  an  ac-
cess  credential,  including  the  ability  to  read  the  card  electronically  for  each  entry 
and exit from the state’s public seaports. 

The  TWIC  final  rule  published  in  the  Federal  Register  allows  for  equivalent  cre-
dentials,  but  seems  to  imply  that  those  equivalencies  will  only  apply  to  certain  De-
partment  of  Defense  (DOD)  cards  or  credentials.  As  the  rule  makes  clear,  there  is 
a need for national, uniform standards for the issuance of a TWIC. However, in light 
of  the  pre-existing  MOU  and  pilot  TWIC  program,  has  the  TSA  considered 
grandfathering the FUPAC as an equivalent credential to the Federal TWIC?

Answer.  The  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  partnered  with  the 
Florida  Department  of  Highway  Safety  and  Motor  Vehicles,  via  a  signed  Memo-
randum  of  Understanding  on  October  17,  2003,  ‘‘to  mutually  plan  for  and  execute 
the  implementation  of  the  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC) 
as  the  common  inter-modal  credential  to  support  both  programs  and  to  fulfill  the 
vision of the TWIC and the requirement of the Florida Uniform Port Access Creden-
tial Program (FUPAC) as outlined in Florida statute (311.12 and 311.125).’’ 

The TWIC Final Rule does not preempt any entity from issuing credentials in ad-
dition  to  the  TWIC.  TSA  continues  to  work  closely  with  Florida  officials  to  align 
FUPAC  with  the  TWIC  program.  Both  parties  agree  that  it  would  be  in  the  best 
interest  of  port  workers  to  issue  a  single  credential.  TSA  has  informed  the  State  of 
Florida that it cannot grandfather FUPAC as an equivalent credential or substitute 
FUPAC  for  TWIC,  because  of  key  distinctions  between  their  requirements  and  the 
TWIC. The two parties are discussing options for Florida to integrate the TWIC into 
their process to comply with their state regulations. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DAVID VITTER TO 

HON. EDMUND S. ‘‘KIP’’ HAWLEY 

Question  1.  Given  the  delays  in  the  process  and  so  many  unanswered  questions 
at this late date, what are you doing to ensure that the maritime industry will have 
time to meet requirements without unacceptable disruptions? 

Answer.  Each  port  will  receive  notice  prior  to  the  commencement  of  enrollment 
at  the  port.  The  Captain  of  the  Port  will  assess  the  progress  of  enrollment  levels 
and  will  publish,  at  least  30  days  in  advance  of  the  effective  date,  notice  to  comply 
with  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  requirements.  This 
provision was included in the regulations to ensure the vast majority of individuals 
within a COTP zone requiring a TWIC would have at least 3 months official notice 
of the compliance date. 

Question  2.  I  feel  that  the  Department  did  not  follow  Congressional  intent  in  de-
veloping  an  interim  work  process.  From  what  I  have  heard  from  my  constituents 
in the various maritime industries, without a significant interim period on the front 
end,  it  seems  that  the  maritime  industries  will  either  have  to  pay  workers  to  not 
work while they wait for the TWIC process or lose the employees and face a poten-
tial labor shortage. 

Answer.  A  new  hire  provision  is  included  in  the  TWIC  final  rule.  This  provision 
is  intended  to  limit  the  risk  presented  by  an  individual  who  has  not  undergone  a 
full  security  threat  assessment  and  is  waiting  to  receive  a  TWIC  while  balancing 
the need to enable individuals to begin work as soon as possible. This provision en-
ables direct employees of the owner or operator, who comply with additional interim 
requirements, to be eligible for access within 3 days of enrolling for their TWIC for 
up to 30 days, with an additional 30 days if necessary (upon approval by the Coast 
Guard), while awaiting TWIC issuance. 

Question  3.  Can  you  explain  the  difference  between  the  thoroughness  of  an  in-

terim security check and a longer term security check? 

Answer.  The  interim  security  check  conducted  on  port  workers  last  year  was  a 
name-based/biographic  check  of  watch  lists  and  databases  related  to  terrorism  and 
legal  status.  Employers  submitted  employee  names  and  limited  biographic  data  for 
the interim check. The interim check did not include the fingerprint-based criminal 
history  records  check  that  will  be  conducted  prior  to  issuing  a  credential  as  part  of 
the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. The informa-
tion used to conduct the TWIC security threat assessment will be gathered by TWIC 
enrollment  personnel  and  will  be  checked  against  specific  identity  documents  pre-
sented  and  verified  at  the  time  of  enrollment.  The  security  threat  assessment  also 
includes a fingerprint-based criminal history records check. 

The  interim  check  was  not  intended  to  replace  the  TWIC  program  nor  was  it  in-
tended to capture the entire maritime port worker population. Rather, it was an im-
mediate  security  measure  designed  to  check  those  populations  employed  within  the 
port  area  and  with  frequent  access,  such  as  employees  of  facility  and  vessel  opera-
tors and longshore labor. A broader maritime port worker population will be covered 
when the TWIC program is fully implemented. 

Question  4.  The  rule  on  TWIC  allows  1  month  for  workers  to  replace  a  lost  card. 
This  seems  to  create  a  problem  in  that  mariners  often  work  for  30  day  shifts.  If  a 
mariner loses a card and files for a replacement, they would almost certainly be on-
board  a  vessel  when  their  work  authority  runs  out.  Did  you  give  any  consideration 
to the operations of vessels when you issued this rule? Are you considering any up-

81 

dates to avoid the situation of someone being unable to legally work while on a ves-
sel out to sea? 

Answer.  Yes,  vessel  operations  were  considered  during  the  development  of  the 
TWIC  regulations.  Field  guidance  pertaining  to  a  mariner’s  inability  to  visit  an  en-
rollment  center  while  underway,  is  currently  being  considered  for  inclusion  into  a 
Navigation  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular  (NVIC).  The  NVIC  will  serve  as  robust 
field  guidance  to  assist  the  Coast  Guard  Captain  of  the  Port  and  the  maritime  in-
dustry  with  TWIC  implementation  and  compliance  and  the  maritime  industry  in 
operationalizing the statutory and regulatory requirements of TWIC implementation 
and compliance. 

Question 5. As we have seen with the No-Fly List, sometimes people with similar 
names are denied access to a flight. What resources will you have in place to make 
sure that problems of mistaken identities or other issues such as that are dealt with 
quickly so that TWIC applicants are not unreasonably delayed? 

Answer.  During  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  enroll-
ment,  the  applicant  provides  biometrics  and  extensive  biographic  information,  well 
beyond  what  is  available  in  the  No-Fly  process  that  will  significantly  reduce  the 
number of individuals identified as potential matches. 

The  initial  adjudication  process  includes  an  assessment  of  each  applicant’s  crimi-
nal history and citizenship status. Each applicant is also vetted against relevant in-
telligence  databases.  Any  applicant  with  potential  disqualifying  information  is  as-
sessed  through  a  process  of  review  by  multiple  trained  adjudicators  who  determine 
whether  the  applicant  meets  the  requirements  to  hold  a  TWIC.  The  process  is  de-
signed to reduce the risk of improperly adjudicating the applicant while minimizing 
the  time  of  adjudication.  Legal  counsel  is  available  to  the  adjudicators  to  help  re-
solve issues before reaching a decision concerning an applicant’s threat to transpor-
tation security within the confines of the regulation. 

TWIC  applicants  who  are  initially  determined  to  present  a  security  risk  are  ad-
vised by letter of this initial finding. The letter explains the applicant’s right to ap-
peal  the  finding  or  request  a  waiver  as  appropriate.  If  the  applicant  wishes  to  ap-
peal  an  initial  determination,  the  applicant  has  the  opportunity  to  request  the 
records on which the initial determination was based. The applicant may submit ad-
ditional information, such as corrected official records on his or her criminal history, 
citizenship status, or other relevant information that may allow the Transportation 
Security  Administration  (TSA)  to  rescind  the  initial  determination.  When  possible, 
TSA will make a reasonable attempt to assist the applicant by identifying or acquir-
ing  information  that  enables  TSA  to  grant  a  favorable  final  determination.  The 
waiver  process  is  similar,  although  waivers  are  based  on  an  assessment  of  risk  de-
spite  the  applicant  being  ineligible  for  a  TWIC  due  to  the  applicant’s  criminal  his-
tory.  This  information  is  reviewed  by  a  board  of  TSA  personnel.  If  a  waiver  or  ap-
peal  is  denied,  the  applicant  has  the  right  to  request  review  by  an  Administrative 
Law  Judge  who  then  provides  a  recommendation  on  the  merits  of  each  individual 
case. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

RADM BRIAN SALERNO 

Question 1. The SAFE Port Act requires the Coast Guard and the TSA to concur-
rently process applications for individuals applying for a TWIC card and a Merchant 
Mariner  Document  (MMD).  How  are  the  Coast  Guard  and  the  TSA  addressing  this 
issue? What steps are you taking to ensure the MMD applications are processed as 
expeditiously as possible? 

Where  is  the  Coast  Guard  in  the  process  of  completing  a  companion  rule  to  con-
solidate existing MMDs and to streamline the application process for mariners who 
are also applying for a TWIC? 

What  processes  and  procedures  has  the  Coast  Guard  established  to  ensure  that 
information is appropriately shared with the TSA and that mariners do not endure 
excessive delays in obtaining their MMD? 

Answer. The Coast Guard and TSA have agreed to share information, but all the 
details  have  not  been  finalized  at  this  time.  We  will  publish  the  details  before  the 
TWIC requirement come into effect for mariners (September 25, 2008, per the TWIC 
final rule). In the meantime, in an effort to ensure MMD applications are processed 
as  quickly  and  consistently  as  possible  and  reduce  delays  in  obtaining  MMDs,  the 
National Maritime Center (NMC) is in the process of centralizing the mariner eval-
uation process in Martinsburg, WV. The NMC is also working on a paperless appli-
cation process.

Public  comments  for  the  Consolidated  Merchant  Mariner  Credential  (MMC)  No-
tice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  (NPRM)  closed  on  April  25,  2007  and  are  being  re-
viewed.  An  MMC  format  decision  meeting  is  scheduled  for  May  2007.  The  MMC 
final  rule  will  be  published  and  in  effect  prior  to  the  requirement  for  mariners  to 
obtain a TWIC. 

The  USCG  and  TSA  are  currently  working  on  resolving  a  number  of  issues  re-

lated to: 

SID convention. 

Organization (ICAO) format. 

• Printing  the  TWIC  digital  photo  on  the  MMC  in  International  Civil  Aviation 
• Printing the TWIC digital fingerprints on the MMC in accordance with ILO185– 
• Ensuring  the  Coast  Guard  is  able  to  retrieve  TWIC  mariner  applicant  FBI  in-
formation, for the purpose of additional safety vetting, after the security vetting 
is complete. 
• Passing,  from  TSA  to  the  Coast  Guard,  the  names  of  mariners  who  apply  for 

a TWIC and are denied by TSA. 

Question 2. How does the Coast Guard plan to handle the potential increased Ad-
ministrative Law Judge (ALJ) case load when the TWIC enrollment process begins? 
Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  believes  that  there  may  be  a  notable  increase  in  ALJ 
case load once TWIC enrollment begins. However, we do not anticipate that this in-
crease in case load will come at the cost of other important Coast Guard work. The 
Coast Guard has performed ALJ work for other government agencies, including the 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), via reimbursable agreement for some 
time.  Any  new  resources  necessary  to  support  the  increase  in  case  load;  including 
Federal  employees  will  be  funded  via  a  modification  to  the  current  reimbursable 
agreement with TSA. 

Question 3. Did the Coast Guard participate in the negotiations regarding the de-
velopment the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standard? Why has 
the  United  States  declined  to  ratify  the  resolution?  Do  you  think  this  poses  addi-
tional burdens for U.S.-flag vessels operating in international commerce? 

Answer.  No,  the  Coast  Guard  did  not  participate  in  development  of  the  ICAO 
standard.  However,  the  Coast  Guard  did  participate  in  the  development  of  the  ILO 
Convention  185,  which  specifies  an  ICAO  standard  for  the  printing  of  information 
on a Seafarer’s Identity Document. 

The Coast Guard defers to the State Department regarding why the U.S. decided 
not to ratify this convention. The Coast Guard has not evaluated the effect that the 
ICAO Standard would have on U.S.-flag vessels. However, regardless of ratification, 
the  Coast  Guard  intends  on  developing  the  Merchant  Mariner’s  Credential  in  a 
manner  that  is  compliant  with  ILO  Convention  185  to  ensure  that  U.S.  mariners 
comply with this convention should it be mandatory in a foreign port-of-call.

Question. Rear Admiral Salerno, I have heard back from several ports in my state 
that  the  Coast  Guard  has  done  a  good  job  in  keeping  port  managers  informed  on 
issues  relating  to  TWIC  regulation  and  implementation.  As  you  know,  Washington 
State  falls  within  District  13  and  is  served  by  both  Sector  Seattle  and  Sector  Port-
land.  Are  you  aware  of  any  inconsistencies  between  Sectors  within  District  13  re-
garding  TWIC  implementation  policies?  For  example,  there  are  a  number  of  non- 
traditional  port  facilities  in  my  state  where  there  may  be  a  need  for  greater  flexi-
bility  in  TWIC  implementation.  How  do  you  ensure  consistency  between  Sectors  so 
there  is  not  confusion  on  TWIC  policy  between  non-traditional  ports  in  the  same 
state? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  is  not  aware  of  any  inconsistencies  between  Sectors 
within  District  13  regarding  TWIC  implementation  policies.  Flexibility  in  deter-
mining compliance dates does exist however in that compliance dates will be estab-
lished based on input from the Captain of the Port (COTP), Transportation Security 
Administration  (TSA)  and  TSA’s  contractor  Lockheed  Martin.  It  is  the  CG’s  and 
TSA’s  goal  to  ensure  the  majority  of  workers  within  a  COTP  Zone  have  ample  op-
portunity to apply for and receive a TWIC during the initial enrollment periods be-
fore setting a compliance date. The USCG is currently developing robust field guid-
ance  in  the  form  of  a  Navigation  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular  (NVIC)  to  assist 
COTP  and  the  maritime  industry  in  operationalizing  the  statutory  and  regulatory 
requirements  of  TWIC  implementation  and  compliance.  National  consistency  is  one

of  the  USCG’s  goals  regarding  the  TWIC  program  and  the  NVIC  is  a  useful  tool

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

RADM BRIAN SALERNO 

Question 1. Primary law enforcement responsibility in US ports rests with a port 
authority  police  force  or  a  local  law  enforcement  organization  and  USCG  personnel 
are  generally  not  onsite  everyday.  How  does  the  USCG  plan  to  accommodate  this 
provision  and  minimize  the  impact  to  local  law  enforcement  by  needing  to  hold  an 
individual  ‘‘until  Coast  Guard  personnel  arrives  to  confiscate  the  TWIC  card?’’ 
Wouldn’t  it  make  more  sense  to  allow  a  bona  fide  law  enforcement  official  to  con-
fiscate a TWIC card based on reasonable cause? 

Answer.  The  Coast  Guard  is  currently  exploring  the  legal  and  operational  issues 
involved  in  allowing  bona  fide  law  enforcement  officials  to  confiscate  TWICs  based 
on reasonable cause. This is one of several options currently being evaluated as the 
Coast  Guard  develops  the  policy  and  field  guidance  associated  with  TWIC  enforce-
ment. The USCG is currently developing robust field guidance in the form of a Navi-
gation  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular  (NVIC)  to  assist  COTP  and  the  maritime  in-
dustry  in  operationalizing  the  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements  of  TWIC  im-
plementation and compliance. 

Question  2.  In  a  joint  TSA/USCG  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  that  was  pub-
lished  in  May  2006,  a  contact  reader  with  PIN  technology  was  proposed.  Industry 
vehemently opposed this technology solution because of the negative impact it would 
have on terminal efficiency. Where does the USCG now stand on the issue? 

Answer. The proposed requirements for biometric readers and Personal Identifica-
tion  Number  (PIN)  usage  by  Transportation  Worker  Identification  Credential 
(TWIC)  holders  prior  to  accessing  secure  areas  of  regulated  facilities  and  vessels 
were excluded from the Final Rule which was published on January 25, 2007. Under 
the existing rule, the TWIC is required to be utilized as a visual identity badge, but 
a  PIN  will  not  be  required  for  routine  unescorted  access  to  facilities  or  vessels.  A 
PIN  however  will  be  necessary  to  ‘‘unlock’’  the  biometric  template  stored  in  the 
TWIC  integrated  circuit  chip,  to  facilitate  the  holder’s  authentication  during  USCG 
spot  checks.  Spot  checks  are  not  anticipated  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  terminal 
efficiency. 

The  TSA  and  the  USCG  are  currently  evaluating  options,  including  the  presence 
or absence of a PIN requirement, for a contactless biometric specification for TWICs 
and readers with this capability. During this process, we are taking serious consid-
eration  of  comments  received  from  regulated  industry  and  labor,  including  com-
ments  from  the  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee,  on  the  require-
ment for a PIN, but no decision has been reached yet. The specification will be pub-
lished and tested in operational environments, pursuant to the SAFE Port Act. Im-
plementation will require a follow-on rulemaking effort. 

Question  3.  The  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory  Committee  (NMSAC)  has 
recommended  that  the  transmission  of  the  biometric  fingerprint  template  from  the 
TWIC  card  to  the  card  reader  not  be  encrypted  because  it  would  complicate  the 
processing,  add  unnecessary  cost  and  maintenance  concerns  as  well  as  slow  down 
terminal  operations.  On  the  other  hand,  the  biometric  industry  has  recommended 
encryption  even  though  they  admit  that  a  fingerprint  template  cannot  be  re-engi-
neered into an identifiable fingerprint and offers no privacy protection. Where is the 
USCG  on  the  issue  of  encryption?  What  is  the  timeline  for  making  a  final  decision 
on  the  selected  TWIC  chip/reader  technology?  When  will  it  be  published?  Finally, 
what is the expected timeline for the publication of the TWIC Phase II NPRM? 

Answer.  The  fingerprint  template  is  considered  Personally  Identifiable  Informa-
tion (PII) and therefore should be protected. When the template is transmitted from 
the  TWIC  to  a  contactless  reader  it  is  subject  to  being  intercepted.  Additionally,  it 
is  possible  to  use  radio  frequency  waves  to  simulate  a  reader  and  thus  ‘‘skim’’  an 
unprotected  template  from  a  card.  Therefore,  in  allowing  contactless  operation,  the 
TWIC  fingerprint  template  must  be  protected  in  some  manner.  As  NMSAC  ruled 
out  using  a  Personal  Identification  Number  (PIN)  to  protect  the  template  during 
transmission,  encryption  to  establish  a  secure  link  over  which  to  transmit  the  tem-
plate is one way to accomplish this protection. 

NMSAC  does  not  believe  the  protection  above  which  is  afforded  by  the  Minutiae 
template  is  necessary  and  therefore  their  recommendation  was  to  not  encrypt  the 
transmission.  They  did  provide  an  additional  specification  for  encryption  with  the 
understanding that encryption might be a government requirement.

Currently if a template were compromised it is unlikely there would be any secu-
rity  or  privacy  implications.  However,  as  technology  moves  forward  and  biometrics 
become  more  commonly  used,  we  cannot  be  certain  this  will  be  the  case  in  the  fu-
ture. Therefore, since a person cannot change their fingerprint template if it is com-
promised, the government must ensure that a level of protection is provided. 

The final contactless specification will be published in the Federal Register in the 
coming  months.  The  USCG  and  the  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA) 
have begun work on the TWIC II NPRM and expect to publish it in early 2008. 

Question 4. Is encryption contemplated for the TWIC program consistent with the 
requirements  put  forth  by  the  DHS  in  the  REAL  ID  Driver’s  License  program 
NPRM? Or any other DHS identification card programs now underway? 

Answer.  Yes.  When  a  biometric  template  or  other  PII  is  being  transmitted  in  a 
contactless  manner  or  otherwise  embedded  in  an  identity  document,  this  informa-
tion  is  protected.  The  best  example  is  HSPD–12/FIPS  201  documents,  upon  which 
the  TWIC  standard  was  based.  REAL  ID  does  not  require  the  collection  of  bio-
metrics. However, DHS proposed that PII embedded in the mag stripe be encrypted.

NORMAN J. RABKIN 

Question  1.  You  state  in  your  testimony  that  TSA  has  developed  a  schedule  for 
enrolling workers and issuing TWIC cards at ports. Have you seen this deployment 
schedule,  and  is  it  based  on  risk?  Did  you  find  it  to  be  reasonable  and  achievable 
schedule? 

Answer.  TSA  reported  to  us  that  the  agency  has  developed  a  schedule  for  enroll-
ing  workers  and  issuing  TWIC  cards  at  ports,  but  we  have  not  seen  a  copy  of  this 
schedule.  As  a  result,  we  did  not  evaluate  whether  the  schedule  is  based  on  risk 
or is reasonable. 

Question 2. When you reviewed the prototype contract in your September 2006 re-
port, did you find how many card readers were deployed, and actually tested? If so, 
at which locations were they tested? 

Answer.  According  to  the  TWIC  prototype  report,  99  TWIC  card  readers  were  in-
stalled  at  19  locations  during  prototype  testing.  According  to  the  prototype  report, 
these locations included: MacArthur Airport in New York; Los Angeles International 
Airport; Broadway Terminal in New Jersey; the Maritime Exchange of the Delaware 
River  and  Bay;  Gloucester  Terminal  in  New  Jersey;  the  Amtrak  Operations  Center 
in Delaware; the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach; Wilmington, Delaware; Pen-
sacola,  Panama  City,  Fernandina,  Canaveral,  and  Manatee,  Florida;  and  5  private 
port terminal facilities at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 

Question 3. As the Coast Guard moves forward with completing a companion rule 
to  consolidate  existing  mariner  credentials,  I  believe  it  is  important  for  the  Com-
mittee to have a better understanding of the impacts these cumulative fees are hav-
ing  on  the  industry.  Can  you  please  provide  a  summary  of  the  procedures  and  the 
costs a mariner incurs to serve on a U.S.-flag vessel? 

Answer.  According  to  the  Coast  Guard,  to  qualify  for  issuance  of  an  entry-level 
merchant marine license or entry-level rating endorsed on a Merchant Mariner Doc-
ument (MMD), an applicant must acquire required sea service experience, complete 
training  specified  in  regulation,  and  pass  a  drug  screen  and  physical  examination. 
This  information  is  submitted  to  a  Coast  Guard  Regional  Examination  Center  for 
evaluation.  The  applicant  must  also  appear  once  during  the  evaluation  process  to 
be identified and be fingerprinted. If the evaluation shows that the applicant meets 
all of the requirements for the credential and a background check and review of the 
National Driver Register are satisfactory, the applicant must then demonstrate pro-
fessional  competence  by  passing  an  examination  or  completing  training  that  sub-
stitutes for the examination. No examination is required for entry-level ratings. 

According  to  the  Coast  Guard,  the  cost  that  a  merchant  mariner  incurs  to  serve 
on  a  U.S.  flag  vessel  can  vary  based  on  region  of  the  country  and  other  factors. 
Coast Guard officials provided an estimate of these costs as follows:

According  to  the  Coast  Guard,  travel  and  miscellaneous  costs  represent  the  costs 
of  appearing  for  examination,  identification,  and  fingerprinting.  Distance  from  an 
examination  center  will  affect  travel  costs.  Travel  costs  to  attend  training  are  in-
cluded  in  the  cost  of  training.  For  the  officer  levels,  the  costs  are  those  applicable 
to  an  applicant  for  a  license  as  third  mate  unlimited  (seagoing  vessels)  or  for  a  li-
cense  as  mate  1,600  gross  register  tons  (inland  vessels).  These  license  levels  rep-
resent  common  entry  points  into  a  seagoing  career.  In  some  cases,  employers  will 
reimburse  applicants  for  some  or  all  of  the  costs  to  qualify  for  a  license  or  MMD. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. TED STEVENS TO 

NORMAN J. RABKIN 

Question  1.  Mr.  Rabkin,  in  your  written  testimony  you  mentioned  both  progress 
made  and  challenges  remaining  for  the  TWIC  program.  Does  TSA  have  sufficient 
force and assets to handle this type of large scale program implementation? 

Answer. Until TWIC program implementation begins later this year, it is difficult 
to evaluate whether TSA and the enrollment contractor have dedicated the staff and 
resources  necessary  to  successfully  implement  the  program.  Since  we  issued  our 
September  2006  report,  TSA  has  added  staff  to  the  TWIC  program  office  to  better 
manage the program and established an office to more closely monitor the perform-
ance of the enrollment contractor. However, we did not evaluate the number of staff 
or  resources  that  the  TWIC  enrollment  contractor  has  dedicated  to  implementing 
the program as part of our review. While additional staff with expertise in program 
and  contract  management  should  help  TSA  to  implement  the  program,  it  remains 
to  be  seen  whether  TSA  and  the  enrollment  contractor  will  be  able  to  implement 
the  TWIC  program  on  such  a  large  scale  covering  770,000  workers  at  about  3,500 
maritime facilities and 5,300 vessels in the required time frames. 

Question 2. If not, what suggestions does GAO have to ensure an effective imple-

mentation of TWIC? 

Answer. Addressing the primary challenges facing the TWIC program is the most 
important  step  to  ensure  effective  implementation.  TSA  and  maritime  industry 
stakeholders face several challenges to ensuring that the TWIC program can be im-
plemented  successfully.  Although  TSA  has  learned  from  TWIC  testing  experiences 
and  has  taken  steps  to  help  address  problems  that  we  previously  identified, 
transitioning from limited testing to full scale implementation will be a major chal-
lenge. In addition, TSA and its enrollment contractor will also need to educate work-
ers on the new TWIC requirements through an effective communication and coordi-
nation strategy, ensure that enrollments begin in a timely manner, and process nu-
merous  background  checks,  appeals,  and  waivers.  Furthermore,  TSA  and  industry 
stakeholders  will  also  need  to  ensure  that  TWIC  access  control  technologies  will 
work  effectively  in  the  maritime  environment,  be  compatible  with  TWIC  cards  that 
will  be  issued,  and  balance  security  with  the  flow  of  maritime  commerce.  As  TSA 
works to implement the TWIC program later this year, it will be important that the 
agency  establish  clear  and  reasonable  time  frames  and  ensure  that  all  aspects  of 
the TWIC program, including the TWIC access control technologies, are fully tested 
in the maritime environment.

NORMAN J. RABKIN 

Question 1. While I appreciate TSA’s willingness to further study the requirement 
directing  each  towing  vessel  to  carry  a  card  reader,  I  remain  concerned  about  the 
effect  of  this  requirement  on  the  maritime  industry,  particularly  its  small  busi-
nesses.  As  you  know,  there  is  significant  opposition  to  requiring  card  readers  on 
every towing vessel. Given that crew sizes on tug boats reportedly run between four 
and  ten  mariners,  and  each  of  those  mariners  is  well  known  to  other  mariners  on 
the tug, as well as management, therefore making any intruder obvious, do you be-
lieve  a  workable  compromise  could  be  reached,  such  as  only  requiring  card  readers 
on vessels employing ten or more mariners?

Answer.  According  to  TSA,  the  agency  will  address  all  requirements  regarding 
TWIC  access  control  technologies,  such  as  biometric  card  readers,  in  a  second  pro-
posed rule that the agency plans to issue during 2008. Until access control require-
ments are set forth in this proposed rule, it is not clear in what circumstances TWIC 
card readers will be required on vessels. In addition, the Security and Accountability 
for  Every  Port  Act  of  2006  states  that  TSA  cannot  require  card  readers  on  vessels 
unless  TSA  determines  that  the  vessel  is  at  severe  risk  or  that  readers  are  nec-
essary due to the number of individuals on board. As such, TSA must consider this 
requirement as well as any public comments regarding the installation on card read-
ers on vessels as part of the second rulemaking in the future. 

Question  2.  The  TWIC  application  process  remains  burdensome  on  workers  and 
the  industries  depending  on  them.  Easier  access  to  TWIC  cards  once  granted  may 
help relieve some of this burden without causing undue security concerns. Many are 
concerned  about  the  cumbersome  process  to  apply  for  a  TWIC  card,  including  the 
long distances some workers will be required to travel to obtain a TWIC card. This 
is  especially  true  for  those  in  the  long  haul  trucking  industry  who  may  end  up  ap-
plying for their card at one enrollment center, but due to the nature of their employ-
ment  may  be  far  from  that  center  by  the  time  the  card  is  ready.  In  your  opinion, 
would  allowing  applicants  to  designate  that  cards  be  returned  to  a  different  enroll-
ment  center  than  where  they  originally  applied  or  alternatively  including  a  mecha-
nism  to  mail  cards  to  an  applicant’s  home  or  office  be  realistic  fixes  for  this  prob-
lem? If not, what do you propose as an alternative? 

Answer.  According  to  TSA,  shipping  a  TWIC  card  to  an  enrollment  center,  other 
than  the  one  at  which  enrollment  took  place,  was  considered  as  well  as  mailing 
cards directly to the applicant during the planning stages of the program. TSA offi-
cials  determined  that  it  would  be  preferable  to  follow  the  process  set  forth  in  Fed-
eral Information Processing Standard 1, which calls for individuals to retrieve iden-
tification  credentials  in  person  so  that  their  identity  can  be  verified.  According  to 
TSA, mailing TWIC cards directly to the individual raises security concerns because 
TSA  would  not  be  able  to  ensure  the  individual  receiving  the  card  was  in  fact  the 
individual that applied for the card. However, TSA officials stated that they under-
stand  that  the  return  visit  to  the  enrollment  center  will  be  inconvenient  for  some 
TWIC  applicants  and  may  reconsider  this  process  in  the  future  to  reduce  burden 
on the affected population. Our review focused on the results of the TWIC prototype 
test and did not evaluate the feasibility of having TWIC cards mailed to a worker’s 
home or office or any other alternative method of picking up a TWIC card. 

Question  3.  The  costs  associated  with  TWIC  may  be  a  barrier  for  some  workers 
and  businesses.  While  I  understand  those  costs  may  compare  favorably  with  other 
card  fees,  they  remain  a  burden  for  the  temporary,  seasonal  labor  in  the  maritime 
industry.  Of  particular  concern  is  the  fact  that  an  applicant  must  pay  for  the  full 
price of the application up front, leaving those applicants who are denied cards pay-
ing  for  the  production  of  cards  they  do  not  receive.  One  potential  solution  may  be 
not  to  reduce  the  overall  costs,  but  the  schedule  on  which  they  are  paid.  In  your 
opinion,  would  it  be  possible  for  TSA  to  charge  only  for  the  cost  of  processing  the 
application and the security assessment up front, with the balance to be paid should 
a card be granted? 

Answer. According to TSA officials, the agency considered allowing workers to ini-
tially  pay  for  the  enrollment  and  threat  assessment  portion  of  the  TWIC  fee  and 
pay  the  remaining  balance  when  the  card  is  issued.  However,  TSA  officials  stated 
that the current process of payment and fee collection provides the best value to the 
total  population  and  limits  the  overall  cost  of  the  TWIC  card.  According  to  TSA, 
while  workers  ultimately  denied  a  TWIC  may  pay  for  the  card  production  and 
issuance  portion  of  program  costs,  they  benefit  from  having  all  applicants  sharing 
equally  in  the  cost  of  the  process.  Workers  whose  criminal  history  would  otherwise 
result  in  denial  of  a  TWIC  may  request  a  waiver  through  the  TSA  redress  process 
and  review  by  an  administrative  law  judge.  Adopting  a  position  that  TWIC  appli-
cants should only pay for the services they directly receive could result in consider-
able  costs  to  those  applicants  utilizing  this  redress  process.  As  part  of  our  review, 
we  did  not  evaluate  TSA’s  rationale  for  requiring  the  fee  to  be  paid  in  full  at  the 
time  of  enrollment  or  the  feasibility  of  any  alternate  methods  of  paying  for  the 
TWIC card. 

Question  4.  The  goal  of  the  TWIC  program  is  to  strengthen  the  security  of  our 
transportation  system,  starting  with  the  implementation  of  a  pilot  without  unin-
tended  consequences.  Unfortunately,  a  host  of  issues  have  plagued  the  successful 
implementation of the pilot, including an incomplete management plan to date, lack 
of contract accountability, and ever-increasing costs to implement the program. I am 
concerned  that  if  we  don’t  fix  these  problems  soon,  we  jeopardize  the  health  of  our 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

87 

workforce, strength of our economy, and overall, security of our Nation. Given these 
are  just  some  of  the  implementation  issues  since  the  TWIC  pilot  was  first  author-
ized  in  2001,  please  describe  how  our  workforce  and  economy  has  been  indirectly 
impacted by these delays. 

Answer.  Our  past  work  on  the  TWIC  program  has  identified  program  delays, 
problems  regarding  testing  and  contract  management,  and  additional  challenges 
that  the  program  faces.  However,  we  did  not  evaluate  either  the  direct  or  indirect 
impact  that  TWIC  program  delays  and  problems  have  had  on  the  workforce  and 
economy. 

Question  5.  It  is  my  understanding  that  the  TWIC  system  will  not  be  interoper-
able with international standards. I am concerned that without uniformity of inter-
national standards, non-U.S. crewman will be exempt from complying with our secu-
rity  provisions  when  entering  U.S.  ports.  Do  you  think  it  is  necessary  to  establish 
an uniform international ID standard? What is the agency’s plan to sync the TWIC 
system with the current biometric technology used by the United Nations and devel-
oped by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)? 

Answer.  According  to  TSA,  the  agency  determined  that  it  is  preferable  to  have 
TWIC  be  interoperable  with  credentials  issued  to  U.S.  Federal  standards  rather 
than  ICAO  standards  for  international  travel  documents.  TSA  officials  stated  that 
TWIC  is  not  intended  for  international  travel,  but  does  have  potential  applications 
with  other  U.S.  Government  credentials.  Therefore,  to  achieve  maximum  interoper-
ability  with  other  programs,  security  and  protection  of  personal  information,  TWIC 
follows  the  Federal  Government  standards  for  biometric  credentials  which  are  con-
tained in FIPS 201 and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) publica-
tion  378.  TSA  plans  to  continue  monitoring  international  developments  and  proto-
cols  to  determine  what  if  any  benefits  to  the  program  they  provide.  As  part  of  our 
review,  we  did  not  evaluate  the  interoperability  of  the  TWIC  system  with  inter-
national  standards  or  TSA’s  plans  to  synchronize  the  TWIC  system  with  biometric 
technologies  used  by  the  United  Nations  or  ICAO.  In  addition,  we  did  not  examine 
the need to establish a uniform international identification standard.

Question. How would you advise the TSA and the Coast Guard to address the sea-

sonal labor issue for the maritime industry? 

Answer.  After  discussion  with  various  facility  operators  and  labor  organizations, 
the issue remains one for which there is no clear answer. While many members are 
in  favor  of  a  provision  that  allows  for  a  ‘‘temporary  credential’’  which  would  be 
capped  after  an  appropriate  number  of  port  visits  (e.g.,  after  the  third  time,  the 
worker  would  be  required  to  obtain  a  TWIC  for  access),  others  see  this  as  difficult 
to monitor. 

We respectfully request that this issue be tabled until after the Coast Guard final-
izes  its  Navigation  and  Vessel  Inspection  Circular  document,  which  will  provide 
guidance  on  the  escort  provisions.  In  addition,  we  expect  it  will  be  necessary  to  re- 
evaluate this issue once the TWIC program is underway and the impact can be ac-
curately assessed. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

LISA B. HIMBER 

Question.  I  understand  you  have  been  involved  in  efforts  to  develop  biometric 
standards  for  the  TWIC  card  readers  that  are  ‘‘contact-less’’—meaning  they  would 
not require entering a password, for example. Doesn’t this type of technology reflect 
the  ‘‘lowest  common  denominator’’  as  opposed  to  the  highest  possible  level  of  secu-
rity? 

Answer. The term ‘‘contactless’’ refers to the fact that a card can be read without 
the  need  to  insert  or  swipe  it  into  a  reader.  The  maritime  industry  believes  it  is 
important to use contactless TWIC readers because contact readers are more quickly 
subject to damage by the normal usage, the environment, and vandalism. 

A  contactless  biometric  may  or  may  not  require  the  use  of  a  Personal  Identifica-
tion  Number  (PIN)  or  other  password.  The  National  Maritime  Security  Advisory 
Committee  recommended  to  DHS  that  under  normal  operating  conditions  (i.e., 
MARSEC I) those who seek access to regulated facilities and vessels be required to 
present  their  TWICs  only.  During  times  of  heightened  security  (MARSEC  II  and

88 

III), individuals would be required to present a biometric for verification in addition 
to the card. 

However, it is important note that during normal operations, persons seeking ac-
cess to a regulated area must verify that they have a legitimate need to enter, and 
in most cases, the individual’s name must be on a gate or appointment list. 

In keeping with the overarching philosophy that DHS must seek to find an appro-
priate  balance  between  enhanced  security  and  facilitation  of  commerce,  the  mari-
time industry believes that adding a requirement for use of a PIN presents an addi-
tional and largely unnecessary potential point of failure which could lead to lengthy 
delays in vessel and cargo processing. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

CAPT. PAUL KAIPO POMAIKAI, SR. 

Question 1. The interim work authority process the TSA provided for in the final 
rule  appears  to  be  more  restrictive  than  what  your  industry  was  hoping  for.  As  I 
understand  it,  newly  hired  workers  must  apply  for  their  TWIC,  pay  the  fee,  pass 
the  named-based  background  check  from  TSA  and  still  be  accompanied  by  an  indi-
vidual  with  a  TWIC  card  at  all  times  while  in  a  port.  Is  my  understanding  of  this 
process  correct?  Can  you  explain  how  that  presents  difficulties  to  your  operations? 
Answer.  Yes,  that  is  the  process  that  is  outlined  in  the  final  rule.  The  biggest 
problem  with  the  interim  work  authority  process  provided  by  TSA  is  that  the  proc-
ess  doesn’t  begin  until  a  new  hire  has  traveled  to  a  TWIC  enrollment  center  and 
applied  for  his  or  her  TWIC  in  person,  plus  paid  the  $137  fee.  This  is  a  problem, 
first of all, because of the burden it imposes on mariners. When you’re a young per-
son  seeking  a  job  who  doesn’t  even  know  yet  if  the  maritime  industry  is  right  for 
you,  it’s  a  big  hurdle  to  be  told  you’ve  got  to  fly  to  another  island  or  take  a  bus 
halfway across the state to a TWIC enrollment center. And, $137 is no small change 
when  you  haven’t  even  started  working  yet.  From  an  employer  perspective,  compa-
nies  in  our  industry  are  very  concerned  that  folks  considering  employment  in  our 
industry will look at these burdens and say, ‘‘No thanks. I think I’ll go do something 
else.’’ The maritime industry is already facing a severe personnel shortage, and the 
last thing we want to do is set up barriers to entry that discourage prospective em-
ployees from coming to work for us. 

The second problem with the TSA process is the additional time it requires before 
a  new  hire  can  be  put  to  work  on  a  vessel.  As  a  practical  matter,  an  employer  will 
not want to send a new hire to a TWIC enrollment center to start the process until 
the  new  hire  has  passed  a  drug  screen,  taken  a  physical,  and  had  his  or  her  ref-
erences  checked.  What  all  of  that  means  is  that  it  may  be  a  week  before  the  indi-
vidual  goes  to  the  TWIC  enrollment  center  and  ‘‘starts  the  clock’’  on  the  interim 
work authority process. 

We  could  address  both  of  these  issues—reducing  burdens  on  mariners  that  dis-
courage new entrants into the industry, and enabling employers to put new employ-
ees to work more quickly—if we could begin the process with a computerized check 
against the terrorist watch list instead of a trip to the TWIC enrollment center. This 
approach  would  not  diminish  security  in  any  way,  since  it’s  the  same  check  that 
TSA  is  proposing  to  use  to  grant  interim  work  authority  in  the  final  rule.  But,  it 
would  save  a  mariner  the  time  and  expense  of  a  trip  to  the  enrollment  center,  and 
it  could  be  done  immediately,  concurrently  with  the  drug  screen,  physical,  and  ref-
erence  checks  that  the  company  will  conduct.  This  would  enable  mariners  to  get  to 
work sooner, since the terrorist watch list check could be in process while the mar-
iner is completing these other essential steps in the new hire process. 

After a reasonable period of time—say, 90 days—a new hire that intended to stay 
in  the  industry  would  be  required  to  go  the  enrollment  center,  apply  for  a  TWIC, 
and pay the $137 fee. This would be a meaningful interim work authority provision 
that would work for the maritime industry without compromising security. 

Question 2. As the Coast Guard moves forward with completing a companion rule 
to  consolidate  existing  mariner  credentials,  I  believe  it  is  important  for  the  Com-
mittee to have a better understanding of the impacts these cumulative fees are hav-
ing  on  the  industry.  Can  you  please  provide  the  Committee  a  summary  of  proce-
dures and of the costs a mariner incurs to serve on U.S.-flag vessels? 

Answer.  A  career  in  the  maritime  industry  is  rewarding,  but  it’s  also  expensive. 
In addition to the cost of the TWIC—$137 for a five-year credential—mariners who 
are  required  to  hold  Coast  Guard  licenses  or  Merchant  Mariner’s  Documents  also 
pay user fees for those credentials. Those fees range from $140 for an original MMD 
with  no  endorsement,  to  $255  for  a  license  as  Mate  or  Master  of  Towing  Vessels, 
to  $280  for  an  MMD  with  a  tankerman  endorsement.  As  with  the  TWIC,  though, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  10:41 Sep 17, 2010 Jkt 039014 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\39014.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

89 

the  cost  of  the  credential  itself  is  only  part  of  the  story—it’s  the  hidden  costs  like 
the  time  and  expense  of  travel  to  a  TWIC  enrollment  center  or  Coast  Guard  Re-
gional Exam Center that are even more significant for most mariners. An even more 
serious concern of many mariners today is the cost of medical tests that may be nec-
essary  to  prove  that  a  mariner  is  medically  qualified  for  a  license  or  document.  A 
draft Coast Guard policy document (a Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular, or 
NVIC,  on  medical  and  physical  standards  for  merchant  mariner  credentials)  would 
require a mariner who has one of more than 200 listed medical conditions to provide 
extensive  information  to  the  Coast  Guard.  In  some  cases,  the  required  information 
includes consultations with specialists and medical test results that may or may not 
be covered by insurance. 

For  mariners  in  the  coastal  and  oceangoing  towing  industry,  there  are  also  enor-
mous  expenses  associated  with  the  training  courses  required  for  an  STCW  certifi-
cate.  (STCW  is  the  International  Convention  on  Standards  of  Training,  Certifi-
cation, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.). 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARIA CANTWELL TO 

CAPT. PAUL KAIPO POMAIKAI, SR. 

Question.  You  have  stated  your  concern  regarding  the  proposal  to  require  card 
readers  on  every  towing  vessel.  In  your  opinion,  would  requiring  card  readers  only 
on  vessels  employing  larger  numbers  of  mariners  (for  example,  ten  or  more)  be  a 
workable  middle  ground?  Would  such  a  compromise  help  alleviate  the  burden  this 
requirement could cause on those in the maritime industry? 

Answer.  This  would  certainly  provide  an  acceptable  compromise.  The  SAFE  Port 
Act  gives  DHS  the  authority  to  limit  the  card  reader  requirement  to  vessels  with 
more  than  a  certain  number  of  crew,  to  be  determined  by  the  agency.  We  suggest 
that,  at  a  minimum,  vessels  with  12  or  fewer  crew  members  requiring  a  TWIC 
should  not  be  required  to  have  a  card  reader  installed  on  board.  Card  readers  are 
simply unnecessary for vessels with small crews, such as towing vessels whose crew 
sizes  typically  range  from  four  to  ten  mariners.  In  an  average  U.S.-flagged  towing 
vessel operation, every employee is known to management and fellow crewmembers. 
A stranger onboard the vessel is immediately obvious. Personal knowledge of fellow 
employees  provides  a  higher  security  standard  than  reliance  upon  an  electronic 
reader,  no  matter  how  sophisticated  the  technology  employed.  Access  control  proce-
dures  are  already  included  as  part  of  a  Coast  Guard-approved  vessel  security  plan. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

MICHAEL J. RODRIGUEZ 

Question. Why is it important that we utilize the International Civil Aviation Or-

ganization standards for U.S.-flag vessels operating in international commerce? 

Answer.  There  are  several  important  reasons  for  using  the  International  Civil 
Aviation  Organization  standards  to  implement  the  Transportation  Worker  Identi-
fication Credential. 

First,  we  agree  wholeheartedly  that  the  implementation  of  a  uniform  Transpor-
tation  Worker  Identification  Credential  (TWIC)  system  is  an  important  tool  in  the 
effort to prevent maritime terrorism. Maritime workers, whether they are longshore-
men,  seafarers  or  harbor  pilots  are  on  the  front  lines.  We  are  deeply  disappointed 
by TSA’s inability to establish a program to identify and bar from security-sensitive 
transportation jobs those individuals who clearly pose a security risk. We shared the 
Committee’s  frustration  when  we  learned,  during  the  April  12,  2007  hearing,  that 
the schedule for TWIC implementation is falling so far behind. We believe that one 
of  the  reasons  it  is  falling  behind  lies  with  the  policy  decision  to  use  the  unproven 
and  inappropriate  FIPS–201  standard  for  the  biometric  identity  cards  in  the  TWIC 
program,  rather  than  the  widely  used  and  internationally  recognized  International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. 

ICAO  is  an  organization  within  the  United  Nations  with  headquarters  in  Mon-
treal.  It  was  established  by  international  convention  in  Chicago  in  1946.  Today 
ICAO  has  190  member  states  including  the  United  States.  Our  country  is  also  a 
member of ICAO’s governing council. 

Civil  aviation  is  a  critical  service  that  is  vital  to  the  global  economy.  Therefore, 
ICAO members work toward standards of practice in biometric identity systems for 
machine  readable  travel  documents  to  facilitate  the  movement  by  air  of  persons 
around the world. Maritime shipping is likewise essential to our global society. The 
movement  of  cargo,  passengers  and  workers  through  our  ports  would  also  benefit 
from the implementation of uniform international standards.

We believe Congress anticipated the need for compatibility between identity docu-
ments  for  transportation  workers  in  the  Maritime  Transportation  Security  Act  of 
2002 (MTSA) section 103(a). The MTSA encourages the U.S. Coast Guard to: 

‘‘. . .  negotiate  an  international  agreement,  or  an  amendment  to  an  inter-
national  agreement,  that  provides  for  a  uniform,  comprehensive,  international 
system of identification for seafarers that will enable the United States and an-
other  country  to  establish  authoritatively  the  identity  of  any  seafarer  aboard  a 
vessel  within  the  jurisdiction,  including  the  territorial  waters,  of  the  United 
States or such other country.’’ 

Likewise,  Section  303(b)(1)  of  the  Enhanced  Border  Security  and  Visa  Entry  Re-
form  Act  of  2002  (Border  Security  Act)  very  clearly  establishes  Congress’s  intent 
that the US system of machine readable, tamper-resistant travel documents conform 
to international standards. The section reads, in part: 

‘‘The  Attorney  General  and  the  Secretary  of  State  shall  jointly  establish  docu-
ment  authentication  standards  and  biometric  identifier  standards  to  be  em-
ployed  on  such  visas  and  other  travel  and  entry  documents  from  among  those 
biometric identifiers recognized by domestic and international standards organi-
zations.’’ 

Furthermore,  in  section  110(a)  of  the  SAFE  Port  Act  of  2006  (SAFE  Port  Act), 
Congress expressed its desire for the Secretary of Homeland Security to expedite the 
crewmember  identification  process  when  it  amended  the  MTSA.  The  amended  sec-
tion 70111(a) of the MTSA now reads: 

‘‘Requirement.—Not  later  than  one  year  after  the  date  of  enactment  of  the 
SAFE  Port  Act,  the  Secretary,  in  consultation  with  the  Attorney  General  and 
the  Secretary  of  State,  shall  require  crewmembers  on  vessels  calling  at  United 
States  ports  to  carry  and  present  on  demand  any  identification  that  the  Sec-
retary decides is necessary.’’ 

If foreign crewmembers will be carrying ICAO-compliant identity documents, it is 
difficult to imagine why the Department of Homeland Security has selected a trans-
portation  worker  identification  system  that  is  not  compatible  with  ICAO.  We  feel 
that  if  the  TWIC  program  were  designed  to  comply  with  the  ICAO  standards,  then 
TSA  and  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  would  have  a  much  greater  chance  of  meeting  the 
deadlines established by Congress. 

Given  the  unambiguous  intent  of  Congress  as  expressed  in  the  MTSA  and  the 
Border  Security  Act  that  the  TWIC  and  U.S.  travel  documents  conform  to  inter-
national standards, its is clear that Congress recognized the value of globally inter-
operable  systems  and  has  directed  the  relevant  agencies  to  pursue  interoperability. 
What  is  not  clear  is  why  TSA  and  the  Coast  Guard  have  ignored  this  aspect  of  the 
Congressional  mandate  and  have  chosen  instead  an  internal  Federal  Government 
standard for the TWIC that will never be interoperable with international standards 
and  was  untested  and  unproven  on  the  massive  scale  required  for  the  TWIC  pro-
gram. 

The  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO),  the  United  Nations  organization  re-
sponsible  for  seafarer  identity  documents,  after  special  sessions,  adopted  the  ILO 
Seafarer  Identity  Document  (SID)  Convention  185  (C–185)  in  June  2003.  The  pur-
pose  of  the  SID  Convention  is  to  establish  uniform  interoperable  biometric  identity 
document  standards  to  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  International  Maritime  Or-
ganization’s  (IMO)  International  Ship  and  Port  Security  Code  (ISPS  Code)  that  es-
tablishes the international maritime security system. The ISPS Code is the product 
of an initiative launched by the United States under the auspices of the United Na-
tions organization responsible for the regulation of international shipping, to estab-
lish  a  uniform  international  maritime  transportation  security  regime.  The  U.S. 
Coast  Guard’s  Federal  maritime  security  regulations  (33  CFR  104  and  105)  are 
based  upon  the  ISPS  Code.  In  addition  to  setting  out  the  fundamentals  for  a  com-
prehensive Seafarer’s Identity Document management system, C–185 prescribes the 
use  of  the  ICAO  biometric  identifier  standards  as  the  basis  for  the  SID.  The  ICAO 
standards are currently in use worldwide for passports, visas and other travel docu-
ments and cards. 

The  ICAO  standards  are  a  proven  and  internationally  accepted  technology  for 
identity  documents.  The  readers  and  other  supporting  hardware  have  also  been 
proven at airports around the world. We believe TWIC should start with this estab-
lished  system  and  build  upon  it  as  technology  advances  and  new  capabilities 
emerge. 

There are several benefits to this approach for the TWIC program.

First,  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  American  taxpayer  will  not 
have  to  invent  a  new  technology.  In  our  view,  this  is  what  Congress  envisioned  in 
authorizing the TWIC program. 

Second,  because  the  SID’s  carried  by  seafarers  from  other  nations  will  be  ICAO 
compliant,  port  facility  operators  and  the  Coast  Guard  would  be  able  to  scan  and 
track  the  identity  documents  of  foreign  seafarers  as  they  enter  and  exit  the  United 
States.  Additionally,  there  would  be  less  of  a  tendency  for  facility  operators  to  lock 
down  seafarers  aboard  their  vessels.  Lock  downs  are  frequent  today,  in  part,  be-
cause  the  seafarers  do  not  have  acceptable  identity  documents.  The  identity  card 
carried  by  a  professional  mariner  should  allow  the  mariner  the  same  freedom  of 
movement in the United States that passports and visas give other travelers. 

Third,  American  seafarers  would  be  able  to  use  their  TWIC  cards  abroad  for  ac-
cess  to  facilities  in  foreign  ports.  This  would  have  the  effect  of  ensuring  American 
seafarers will have free access for shore leave, crew changes, and travel to and from 
their ships. 

By  starting  from  a  straightforward  and  uncomplicated  foundation—by  adopting 
the same proven technology that is widely used for access control of foreign visitors 
to  the  United  States  as  well  as  at  international  airports  and  in  foreign  ports,  we 
can dramatically reduce the problems with the present TWIC program and increase 
the ease and speed of implementation of the TWIC. 

We understand that TSA and the Coast Guard have invested a great deal of time 
and  money  in  trying  to  develop  a  new  technology  for  the  TWIC  program.  However, 
TSA  has  issued  not  even  a  single  working  TWIC  card  5  years  after  being  directed 
to do so by Congress. We believe it is not too late to get the program right by mov-
ing  forward  with  a  simple,  internationally  accepted  and  interoperable  identification 
program based on the ICAO standards. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG TO 

MICHAEL J. RODRIGUEZ 

Question  1.  How  many  states  are  moving  forward  with  their  own  security 

credentialing programs in the absence of a Federal system? 

Answer.  At  this  point,  we  are  aware  of  only  one  state—Florida—in  which  indi-
vidual ports have each put in place their own unique security credentialing and ac-
cess control programs. However, it is important to understand that under the exist-
ing  statute,  there  is  no  Federal  preemption  over  such  programs—not  only  each 
state, but each individual port and individual facilities within the same port are free 
to impose their own requirements for access control and security credentialing. This 
means  that  mariners  who  have  a  Federal  TWIC  card  and  who  work  aboard  vessels 
that trade from port to port, from state to state, and from the United States to over-
seas  ports  will  nevertheless  be  subjected  to  numerous  costly  and  time-consuming 
background  checks  and  application  processes,  delaying  and  impeding  their  oppor-
tunity  to  do  their  jobs  and  earn  their  livelihood  and  unnecessarily  disrupting  the 
movement of American commerce. 

In  addition,  the  lack  of  a  Federal  program  could  mean  that  mariners:  (1)  who  do 
not  possess  a  credential  issued  by  the  local  facility  will  be  prohibited  from  taking 
shore leave or joining a vessel while the vessel is docked at the facility, (2) will have 
to  pay  each  facility  for  an  access  card,  (3)  will  have  to  continue  to  pay  outrageous 
fees  for  escort  and  security  services  or  face  imprisonment  aboard  their  vessels,  and 
(4)  will  be  discouraged  from  remaining  in  the  industry  by  additional,  unnecessary 
administrative and financial burdens. 

The  preamble  to  TSA’s  Final  Rule  on  TWIC  (January  25,  2007)  on  the  question 

of Federal preemption states: 

‘‘Under  this  rulemaking,  States  will  not  be  preempted  from  instituting  their 
own background checks or badging systems in addition to the TWIC.’’ 

In the recently published USCG circular that contains guidance for the implemen-
tation  of  the  TWIC  program  port  facilities  are  advised  that  they  may  incorporate 
the TWIC into their own unique existing access control systems. 

It is clear that if individual states and port facilities are permitted to retain their 
own unique access control systems, the national character of the TWIC card will be 
destroyed and the TWIC program will be worthless from the standpoint of mariners, 
ship service personnel, long haul truck drivers, rail crews and other traveling work-
ers who require a single credential that can be used across the entire system. 

Transportation  workers  require  a  universally  accepted  card  that  can  be  used 
across all ports where their employment may take them. Such workers are an inte-
gral  part  of  the  transportation  system  that  makes  interstate  and  foreign  commerce

possible.  Imposing  additional  local  requirements  that  demand  numerous  applica-
tions,  background  checks  and  fees,  perhaps  for  dozens  of  individual  cards,  clearly 
places an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreign commerce. There is an ur-
gent  need  for  Federal  laws  and  regulations  governing  the  TWIC  to  preempt  any 
state or local requirements on the same subject matter for such workers. 

We  believe  that  unless  the  Federal  Government  acts  to  ensure  that  the  Federal 
TWIC  preempts  any  and  all  state  and  local  programs,  the  maritime  workforce  will 
be  negatively  affected  and  the  efficient  flow  of  commerce  will  be  impeded  without 
the achievement of any additional security benefits for our Nation. Requiring mari-
time  workers  to  obtain  a  separate  access  control  credential  for  every  port,  facility 
and terminal at which their vessel calls or at which they work will subject American 
maritime transportation workers to additional financial and administrative burdens, 
discouraging Americans from entering our industry and encouraging others to leave 
the  industry  for  other  employment—adversely  affecting  the  civilian  maritime  man-
power base relied upon by the Department of Defense. 

From  a  security  standpoint,  there  is  nothing  to  be  gained  from  subjecting  Amer-
ican  mariners  to  the  whims  and  vagaries  of  each  individual  state,  port  and  facility 
that decides to issue its own access and security credential. The final rule to imple-
ment  the  Federal  TWIC  program  has  been  published  and  these  national  require-
ments, and not local requirements, should prevail. 

Question  2.  How  long  do  you  think  they  will  wait  for  the  DHS  to  get  this  right? 
Answer.  Although  we  do  not  have  access  to  information  regarding  the  intentions 
of  individual  states,  ports  and  facilities,  we  believe  it  is  fair  to  conclude  that  the 
legitimate  concerns  about  the  risks  of  a  maritime-related  terrorist  act  and  the 
delays  in  implementing  a  Federal  program  will  lead  to  more  state  and  local  access 
control  systems.  We  understand  these  concerns,  and  we  understand  why  states, 
ports and individual facilities may see the need to act unilaterally to fill a vacuum. 
We  also  understand  that  the  more  this  happens,  the  more  disruptive  it  will  be  for 
maritime commerce. 

To  the  degree  to  which  states,  ports  and  facilities  act,  each  different  system  will 
require  a  separate  application  process,  a  separate  background  check,  separate  ad-
ministrative procedures, and separate paperwork burdens. This will not enhance se-
curity  as  much  as  cause  confusion  and  disruptions.  We  reiterate  that  the  best  way 
for  the  Federal  Government  to  act  quickly  and  efficiently,  and  to  fulfill  its  respon-
sibilities  to  protect  national  security  and  to  encourage  the  unimpeded  flow  of  com-
merce, is to adopt the ICAO standards we referenced previously and to ensure that 
the Federal system preempts all others. Acting expeditiously and forcefully is, in our 
opinion, the best way for the Federal Government to ‘‘get it right’’. 

We thank the Committee for the opportunity to give testimony on the TWIC pro-
gram and we are pleased to answer these questions. We look forward to continuing 
to  assist  the  Committee  in  whatever  manner  necessary,  including  bringing  in  tech-
nical  experts  who  can  speak  with  greater  authority  on  the  technical  aspects  of  our 
views.
