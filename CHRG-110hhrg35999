A Path Toward the Broader Use of
Biofuels: Enhancing the Federal

Commitment to Research and Development

to Meet the Growing Need

THURSDAY, JUNE 14, 2007

2:30 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

The  House  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and
Environment  will  hold  a  hearing  entitled  ‘‘A  Path  Toward  the  Broader  Use  of
Biofuels:  Enhancing  the  Federal  Commitment  to  Research  and  Development  to  Meet
the  Growing  Need’’  on  June  14,  2007,  at  2:30  p.m.  in  Room  2318,  Rayburn  House
Office Building.

The purpose of this hearing is to examine the federal efforts on research, develop-
ment and demonstration of technologies related to the production of biofuels, the de-
velopment  of  biorefineries  and  demonstrations  of  those  technologies.  The  hearing
will  further  focus  on  legislative  proposals  to  restructure  and  enhance  the  biofuels
research  and  development  programs  of  the  Department  of  Energy  and  the  Depart-
ment of Agriculture under consideration in the House and Senate and how the pro-
visions  will  help  to  enhance  ongoing  research  in  areas  related  to  biofuels  and  pro-
mote a greater degree of coordination of research materials related to biofuels.
Background

High  gasoline  prices,  a  desire  to  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  sources  of  en-
ergy, and concerns over climate change have greatly increased interest in bio-based
fuels  as  an  alternative  to  petroleum  for  transportation  fuel.  Over  the  last  several
years,  in  part  as  a  result  of  the  Renewable  Fuel  Standard  included  in  the  Energy
Policy Act of 2005, the use of biofuels—most notably corn-based ethanol—has grown
significantly.  Ethanol  is  most  commonly  blended  with  gasoline  at  a  level  of  10  per-
cent  or  less.  And,  this  still  only  represents  a  small  portion  (less  than  five  percent)
of the total gasoline sold.

Recent  proposals  in  Congress  and  by  the  Administration  have  called  for  signifi-
cant increases in the use of biofuels over the next ten years. Currently biofuel sup-
ply relies almost exclusively on corn-based ethanol. Concerns have been raised about
further  expansion  of  corn-based  ethanol  to  meet  the  targets  set  for  biofuel  produc-
tion. Competition with food and feed supply, water and nutrient demand associated
with  corn  production,  and  continued  questions  about  the  energy  balance  of  corn-
based  ethanol  production  all  suggest  that  biomass  sources  for  biofuel  production
must  be  diversified  The  majority  of  this  focus  has  been  development  of  fuels  from
cellulosic materials including grasses, wood, and waste materials. However, current
technologies for the development of fuel from these sources continue to be expensive
and not cost-competitive with corn-based ethanol.

If  we  are  going  to  move  toward  broader  use  of  biofuels,  technology  will  be  nec-
essary  to  create  reasonably  priced  fuels  from  cellulosic  materials.  The  Agricultural
Risk Protection Act of 2000 (Title III), the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act
of 2002, and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 created bioenergy research and develop-
ment programs to focus federal research funding on the development of biofuels de-
rived  from  cellulosic  materials.  This  research  is  ongoing  and  operates  under  a
Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Energy and the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.

Legislative Proposals/Discussion Draft

4

The  Committee  on  Agriculture  marked  up  a  title  on  Energy  at  the  end  of  May.
Their  proposal  amends  the  Sections  of  the  2002  Farm  Bill  that  authorize  joint
USDA  and  DOE  research  and  development  programs  on  biofuels  and  amends  the
Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, the other primary authorization for
joint DOE and USDA biomass research and development programs.

The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported energy legislation
to  amend  and  expand  authorization  for  research  and  development  programs  on
biofuels at the Department of Energy (S. 1419).

Earlier today, Subcommittee Chairman Lampson released a ‘‘Discussion Draft’’ of
legislation  entitled  The  Biofuels  Research  and  Development  Enhancement  Act.  The
witnesses  have  been  provided  a  copy  of  the  draft  and  are  being  asked  to  include
thoughts on the draft in their testimony. A copy of the draft and a section-by-section
are attached. To quickly summarize, the draft would do the following:

• As  it  relates  to  Section  932  (Bioenergy  Programs)  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of

2005, discussion draft does several things:

1) Creates a new research component to focus on biofuels infrastructure.
2) Creates  a  new  research  component  to  focus  on  energy  efficiency  in  bio-
refinery  facilities  to  reduce  energy  consumption  in  the  development  of
biofuels.

3) Increases  the  authorization  levels  for  the  Bioenergy  program.  Specifi-

cally:
Æ FY08—$377 million
Æ FY09—$398 million
Æ FY10—$419 million

• Creates  an  ‘‘Information  Center’’  at  the  Department  of  Energy  to  serve  as  a

clearinghouse of information about biofuels research and development.

• Creates  a  grant  program  for  states  with  low  levels  of  biofuels  production  to

work toward higher levels of production.
• The draft also conducts several studies:

Æ Increasing consumption of mid-level (10–40 percent) ethanol-blended gas-

oline

Æ Optimization of Flex Fuel Vehicles while running on E–85
Æ Engine durability at differing blend levels of biodiesel.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  would  like  to  extend  a  warm  welcome  to
all  five  of  our  witnesses.  Thank  you  for  being  here  today  and  for
testifying before the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment on
the  subject  of  biofuels  and  more  specifically  on  the  status  of  our
biofuels  research  and  development,  and  what  steps  we  can  take  to
enhance  the  efforts  toward  better  commercialization  of  new  tech-
nologies.  I  still  say  our  old  technologies.  We  are  just  dusting  them
off and using them again.

I  would  like  to  make  specific  mention  that  we  are  joined  today
by  Mr.  John  Berger,  Chairman  and  CEO  of  Standard  Renewable
Energy.  I  recently  joined  Mr.  Berger  at  the  opening  of  his  com-
pany’s  large  scale  biodiesel  facility  in  Galveston,  Texas,  and  I  look
forward to hearing more from him today about his experiences and
continuing  research  and  development  challenges  facing  the  indus-
try.

For  sometime  now,  it  has  been  clear  to  me  and  many  of  my  col-
leagues  that  our  nation’s  energy  needs  can  no  longer  be  met  with
fossil fuels, fully met at least. Our reliance on fossil fuels, and more
specifically  foreign  sources  of  energy,  jeopardizes  our  economy,  our
foreign  policy,  our  national  security,  and  most  importantly  our  en-
vironment.

The  scale  and  complexity  of  addressing  our  energy  and  climate

challenges cannot be overstated.

And  though  I  believe  that  fossil  fuels  still  remain  an  important
part of any viable, balanced energy strategy, we must continue and
in  many  cases  enhance  our  efforts  to  develop  alternative  energy
sources, namely biofuels.

All  of  the  country  ventures  like  Galveston  Bay  Biodiesel  are
emerging  that  demonstrate  our  country’s  strong  commitment  to
producing  reliable  energy  through  the  use  of  exciting  and  cutting-
edge  technologies.  These  projects  are  shining  examples  of  the
American innovative spirit.

Further,  they  demonstrate  how  a  strong  federal  commitment  to
research and development can spur our economic growth and result
in real solutions to our energy problems.

Though  we  have  seen  amazing  growth  in  our  country’s  biofuels
development,  mostly  in  the  forms  of  corn-based  ethanol  and  soy-
based  biodiesel,  ethanol  still  represents  only  five  percent  of  the
total  gasoline  sold,  and  biodiesel  is  an  even  smaller  portion  of  the
total diesel market.

Currently,  biofuel  supply  relies  almost  exclusively  on  corn-based
ethanol. Surely, we wouldn’t be where we are today without the ef-
forts of those who pioneered the development of our ethanol indus-
try.  Recognition  of  these  efforts  to  build  the  ethanol  industry  and
make current supplies of ethanol available is well deserved.

However,  concerns  have  been  raised  about  further  expansion  of
corn-based  ethanol  and  its  impact  on  food  and  feed  supply  and
costs.  And  to  meet  some  of  the  biofuels  mandates  that  have  been
proposed, it would require nearly half of the current corn crop pro-
duced  annually.  Clearly  this  all  suggests  that  biomass  sources  for
biofuel production must be diversified.

The majority of this focus to diversify feedstocks has been on cel-
lulosic  materials  including  grasses,  wood,  and  waste  materials.
However,  current  technologies  for  the  development  of  fuel  from

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:23 Mar 03, 2008 Jkt 035999 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061407\35999 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

7

these  sources  continue  to  be  expensive  and  not  cost  competitive
with  corn-based  ethanol.  If  we  are  going  to  move  toward  broader
use  of  biofuels,  technology  will  be  necessary  to  create  reasonably-
priced fuels from cellulosic materials.

To  realize  this  needed  ‘‘technological  bump,’’  we  must  increase
our investment in research and development, focus our research on
the  most  promising  technologies,  and  ensure  that  the  latest  re-
search  information  is  readily  available  for  those  looking  to  either
expand  their  biofuels  production  or  embark  upon  the  development
of new facilities.

Earlier this week the Committee staff released a discussion draft
of  a  bill  that  I  will  author  and  the  Committee  plans  to  consider  in
coming weeks. The draft attempts to better coordinate and compile
information from federal biofuels research programs, focus some of
the  biofuels  research  on  infrastructure  needs  and  efficiency  of  bio-
refineries,  study  some  of  the  continuing  challenges  facing  broader
use  of  biofuels,  and  increase  the  funding  levels  for  biofuels  re-
search.

This  draft  will  serve  as  a  starting  point  to  discuss  what  legisla-
tive  efforts  are  needed  to  ensure  that  we  maximize  the  federal
funding spent on biofuels research and development. I am eager to
hear from colleagues on the challenges that they see ahead and to,
and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee as we move forward toward consideration of that bill.

It  is  my  hope  that  our  witnesses  today  will  share  with  the  Sub-
committee  their  thoughts  on  the  state  of  biofuels  research  and  de-
velopment,  the  technological  challenges  that  we  continue  to  face,
the  efforts  underway  to  commercialize  the  new  technologies  for
biofuels  development,  and  what  steps  can  be  taken  to  ensure  that
there  is  strong  continued  federal  support  for  biofuels  research,  de-
velopment, and commercialization of technologies.

Their  testimony  will  surely  help  guide  us  toward  crafting  sen-
sible  legislation  that  will  help  us  realize  the  benefits  of  biofuels  in
years to come.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

development  of  our  ethanol  industry.  Recognition  of  there  efforts  to  build  the  eth-
anol  industry  and  make  the  current  supplies  of  ethanol  available  is  well  deserved.
However,  concerns  have  been  raised  about  further  expansion  of  corn-based  eth-
anol  and  its  impact  on  food  and  feed  supply  and  costs.  And,  to  meet  some  of  the
biofuels mandates that have been proposed, it would require nearly half of the cur-
rent corn crop produced annually. Clearly, this all suggests that biomass sources for
biofuel production must be diversified.

The majority of this focus to diversify the feedstocks has been on cellulosic mate-
rials  including  grasses,  wood,  and  waste  materials.  However,  current  technologies
for the development of fuel from these sources continue to be expensive and not cost-
competitive  with  corn-based  ethanol.  If  we  are  going  to  move  toward  broader  use
of  biofuels,  technology  will  be  necessary  to  create  reasonably  priced  fuels  from  cel-
lulosic materials.

To  realize  this  needed  ‘‘technological  bump,’’  we  must  increase  our  investment  in
research  and  development,  focus  our  research  on  the  most  promising  technologies,
and ensure that the latest research information is readily available for those looking
to  either  expand  their  biofuels  production  or  embark  upon  the  development  of  new
facilities.

Earlier  this  week,  the  Committee  staff  released  a  discussion  draft  of  a  bill  that
I  will  author  and  the  Committee  plans  to  consider  in  the  coming  weeks.  The  draft
attempts to better coordinate and compile information from federal biofuels research
programs, focus some of the biofuels research on infrastructure needs and efficiency
of  biorefineries,  study  some  of  the  continuing  challenges  facing  broader  use  of
biofuels, and increase the funding levels for biofuels research.

This  draft  will  serve  as  a  starting  point  to  discuss  what  legislative  efforts  are
needed  to  ensure  we  maximize  the  federal  funding  spent  on  biofuels  research  and
development.  I  am  eager  to  hear  from  colleagues  on  the  challenges  they  see  ahead,
and  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  as  we  move
forward toward consideration of this bill.

It  is  my  hope  that  our  witnesses  today  will  share  with  the  Subcommittee  their
thoughts  on  the  state  of  biofuels  research  and  development,  the  technological  chal-
lenges  we  continue  to  face,  the  efforts  underway  to  commercialize  new  technologies
for biofuels development, and what steps can be taken to ensure that there is strong
continued  federal  support  for  biofuels  research,  development  and  commercialization
of technologies.

Their testimony will surely help guide us toward crafting sensible legislation that

will help us realize the benefits of biofuels in years to come.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  At  this  time  I  am  pleased  to  recognize  the
distinguished  Ranking  Member  from  South  Carolina,  Mr.  Bob  Ing-
lis, for his opening statement.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Appreciate  the  hearing
this  afternoon  on  how  the  Federal  Government  can  encourage  re-
search and development of biofuels, a promising alternative energy
source.

One  of  the  great  advantages  of  biofuels  is  the  regional  diversity
of  feedstocks.  Different  parts  of  the  country  can  ‘‘customize’’  pro-
duction based on their energy sources that make the most sense for
their area. So while pines or sugar cane might make sense for eth-
anol  production  in  South  Carolina,  the  Chairman’s  State  of  Texas
might benefit more from soybean or vegetable oils for biodiesel pro-
duction.  The  advantage  then  is  that  every  part  of  the  Nation  can

take part in developing biofuels that will make economic and agri-
cultural sense and, in turn, will yield commercial benefits.

However,  that  versatility  will  also  present  a  challenge  when  it
comes  to  infrastructure  development.  While  oil  tankers  and  mas-
sive  pipelines  support  our  national  gasoline  industry  and  have  the
potential  to  support  our  biofuels  industry,  the  regional  availability
of  feedstocks  may  demand  additional  models  for  production  and
distribution.  I  hope  that  any  biofuel  legislation  we  discuss  con-
siders and accommodates this regional component.

We  are  only  in  the  beginning  phases  of  what  I  hope  will  be  a
very  profitable  biofuel  energy  economy,  promoting  energy  security,
protecting  the  environment,  and  creating  jobs  for  American  work-
ers. It is important that we not only encourage current technologies
and  methods  of  production  but  also  facilitate  the  development  of
next generation systems that will make biofuels even more efficient
and affordable.

Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. I look
forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  and  welcome  any  sugges-
tions they may have for how we can improve this proposed legisla-
tion.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Good  afternoon.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  holding  this  hearing  on  how  the
Federal  Government  can  encourage  research  and  development  of  biofuels,  a  prom-
ising alternative energy source.

One of the great advantages of biofuels is the regional diversity of feedstocks. Dif-
ferent  parts  of  the  country  can  ‘‘customize’’  production  based  on  the  energy  sources
that make the most sense for their area. So, while pines or sugar cane might make
sense  for  ethanol  production  in  South  Carolina,  the  Chairman’s  State  of  Texas
might benefit more from soybean and vegetable oils for biodiesel production. The ad-
vantage  then  is  that  every  part  of  the  Nation  can  take  part  in  developing  biofuels
that will make economic and agricultural sense, and, in turn, will yield commercial
benefits.

However,  that  versatility  will  also  present  a  challenge  when  it  comes  to  infra-
structure  development.  While  oil  tankers  and  massive  pipelines  support  our  na-
tional gasoline industry, and have the potential to support our biofuels industry, the
regional availability of feedstocks may demand additional models for production and
distribution.  I  hope  that  any  biofuel  legislation  we  discuss  considers  and  accommo-
dates this regional component.

We  are  only  in  the  beginning  stages  of  what  I  hope  will  be  a  very  profitable
biofuel energy economy, promoting energy security, protecting the environment, and
creating jobs for American workers. It is important that we not only encourage cur-
rent  technologies  and  methods  of  production,  but  also  facilitate  the  development  of
next generation systems that will make biofuels even more efficient and affordable.

and welcome any suggestions they might have for how we can improve this proposed
legislation.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis.  I  ask  unanimous
consent  that  all  additional  opening  statements  submitted  to  the
Subcommittee,  submitted  by  Subcommittee  Members  be  included

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  afternoon.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  calling  today’s  hearing  to  receive

testimony on the discussion draft of the Biofuels Research and Development Act.

ment of a national market for renewable energy was achieved through a Renewable
Fuels  Standard  (RFS).  Further,  the  2002  Farm  bill  has  awarded  $58.1  million  in
grants  to  55  projects  in  27  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia  under  the  Biomass
Research  and  Development  Initiative.  Since  the  beginning  of  2007,  the  Department
of  Energy  (DOE)  has  announced  nearly  $1  billion  in  funding  for  biofuels  R&D.  On
Tuesday,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA)  and  the  U.S.  Department  of
Energy (DOE) announced a combined total of up to $18 million will be available for
research  and  development  of  biomass-based  products,  biofuels,  bioenergy  and  re-
lated processes. These grants will fund essential research leading to the creation of
new,  sustainable  energy  sources,  in  addition  to  creating  new  uses  and  markets  for
agricultural  products.  Through  the  passage  of  critical  energy  legislation,  biofuels
production  has  exploded  and  will  jump  from  the  roughly  four  billion  gallons  pro-
duced in 2005 to 12 billion gallons by the end of this year.

My  home  state  of  Illinois  is  already  experiencing  considerable  growth  in  biofuels
production.  Currently  in  Illinois,  there  are  47  proposed  ethanol  plants,  eight  in  my
district  alone.  Of  those  47  proposed  plants,  19  have  filed  for  air  permits.  Further,
Illinois  is  operating  four  biodiesel  facilities  and  three  more  are  under  construction.
Illinois  is  perfectly  located  to  build  and  operate  ethanol  and  biodiesel  facilities  be-
cause of its access corn and soybean production and to transportation ranging from
rail, barges, highways, and pipelines.

In  addition  to  helping  satisfy  our  nation’s  growing  appetite  for  energy,  biofuels
can  assist  greatly  in  rural  development.  Each  ethanol  plant  represents  the  invest-
ment of tens of millions of dollars into local economies, construction jobs and perma-
nent employment opportunities, new markets for grain producers, and an expanded
tax base for local governments.

While  I  support  research  into  developing  an  efficient  process  for  turning  biomass
into  fuel,  it  is  unclear  why  additional  funding  it  is  need  to  provide  money  to  states
with  low  rates  of  ethanol  production,  including  low  rates  of  production  of  cellulosic
biomass ethanol, as stated in Section 6 of the discussion draft legislation.

I look forward to hearing from our witness panel on this issue.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  introduce  our
distinguished panel of witnesses. Dr. Thomas Foust is the Biomass
Technology  Manager  for  the  Department  of  Energy’s  National  Re-
newable  Energy  Laboratory  in  Golden,  Colorado.  John  Berger  is
the  Founder  of  Contango  Capital  Management,  a  Venture  Capital
firm,  focused  on  renewable  energy  and  CEO  of  Standard  Renew-
able  Energy.  Mr.  Berger  also  served  as  an  advisor  to  the  Federal
Energy  Regulatory  Commission  in  2002  and  2003.  Mr.  Bob
Dinneen is the President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Associa-
tion,  the  National  Trade  Association  for  the  U.S.  ethanol  industry.
Mr. David Waskow is an International Policy Analyst with Friends
of  the  Earth,  U.S.,  and  works  on  environment  trade  and  corporate
accountability  issues.  And  at  this  time  I  would  yield  to  our  distin-
guished  Ranking  Member  of  the  Full  Committee,  Representative
Hall, to introduce our final witness, Mr. Michael McAdams.

Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am honored to intro-
duce Mike McAdams. He is presently Executive Director of Govern-
ment Affairs of Hart Downstream Energy Services. He has been in-
volved,  he  doesn’t  look  old  enough,  I  know,  to  say  this,  but  he  has
been involved in every major federal energy and environmental ini-
tiative over the last 25 years.

I  came  here  in  1981,  and  Mike,  to  the  best  of  my  recollection,
was  the  very  first  employee  that  I  had.  I  inherited  him  from  Ray-
burn,  Sam  Rayburn’s  organization  through  Ray  Roberts,  who  was
the  Congressman  then  at  that  time,  and  he  actually  took  care  of
Ray  Roberts’  boat,  and  I  had  bought  Ray  Roberts’  boat.  It  is  a  52
footer.  I  was  going  to  live  on  it  until  my  wife  told  me  that  that
wasn’t going to happen. I asked him if he would stay on and work
with me. I really wanted him to run the boat for me. He said, well,
he  did  want  to  stay,  but  he  believed  he  was  worth  more  as  an  en-

ergy  advisor,  and  I  don’t  know,  he  was  19  or  20  years  old  then,
something like that. He would be better as an energy advisor than
he would as a boat boy, and he was a great energy advisor and has
really  done  me  great  service  since  that  time.  In  his  current  capac-
ity  he  spearheads  governmental  advocacy  efforts  for  Hart’s  clients
including the Advanced Biofuels Coalition. Prior to joining the firm
he  spent  14  years  with  British  Petroleum  acting  as  Vice  President
of Federal Affairs and Environment and Associate Group Policy Ad-
visor  while  there.  Before  joining  BP,  of  course,  Mr.  McAdams
served on staffs of several Members of Congress, and I was honored
that he worked with me for a lot of years. He holds a B.A. in polit-
ical  science  from  Virginia  Tech.  I  think  he  played  quarterback  for
that  football  team.  He  has  a  J.D.  from  the  Washington  College  of
Law.  His  father  was  the  first  Governor’s  Rep  as  Texas  was  one  of
the early states to have a Washington office, and his father was the
man  for  the  Governor  of  Texas  at  that  time  and  represented  him
here.  He  grew  up  on  a  Texas  ranch,  and  was  educated  at  Virginia
Tech. He is a bright young man, good friend of mine. I am honored
that he is going to testify before this committee.

I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  my  fellow  Texan,  for  allowing  me

this long, extended introduction that Mike helped me write.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  THOMAS  D.  FOUST,  BIOMASS  TECH-
NOLOGY  MANAGER,  NATIONAL  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  LAB-
ORATORY
Dr. FOUST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for this oppor-
tunity  to  discuss  important  issues  related  to  our  nation’s  energy
policies as we move to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, main-
tain a healthy environment, and fully meet the energy demands of
the future.

I  am  the  Biomass  Research  Director  of  the  National  Renewable
Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  in  Golden,  Colorado.  NREL  is  the  U.S.
Department of Energy’s primary laboratory for research and devel-
opment  of  renewable  energy  as  well  as  energy  efficiency  tech-
nologies.

Biomass, as you know, is very abundant in the U.S. and the pro-
duction  potential  is  quite  large.  One  recent  study  estimated  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:23 Mar 03, 2008 Jkt 035999 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061407\35999 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

12

the U.S. has the potential to produce 1.3 billion tons of biomass an-
nually without impacting food production. That amount of biomass
converted to biofuels could potentially supply over 50 percent of our
nation’s fuel needs.

However,  to  use  these  and  other  resources  we  need  to  perfect
new technologies that convert this material into fuels economically.
Clearly this is an area that has great promise, but it must be done
correctly.

Let  me  start  with  ethanol.  To  move  the  ethanol  industry  to
where we need it to be we would have to move corn grain as a pri-
mary  feedstock  resource,  and  we  have  to  move  into  biomass.  Pro-
duction of ethanol from corn grain is a well-established technology.
It  is  a  good  technology,  but  corn  grain  is  also  an  important  food
and  feed  commodity  in  the  U.S.,  and  most  believe  that  we  cannot
produce  more  than  about  12  to  15  billion  gallons  a  year  from  corn
without  having  significant  impacts  on  the  economics  of  other  crit-
ical corn grain products.

Ethanol  from  plant  biomass,  or  bioethanol  as  it  is  commonly  re-
ferred  to,  promises  to  meet  these  ethanol  capacity  hurdles  by  uti-
lizing  feedstocks  as  biomass  which  are  abundant  and  do  not  com-
pete with other needs.

However, the technology is relatively immature and not yet com-
petitive  with  corn  ethanol  or  gasoline.  At  NREL  our  biofuels  focus
is  almost  entirely  on  advancing  this  bioethanol  technology  to  en-
able  competitively-priced  ethanol  from  a  variety  of  feedstocks.  The
current  goal  is  to  attain  $1.31  production  cost  via  2012  via  both  a
biochemical and a thermochemical route in order to make this bio-
ethanol competitive with corn ethanol and, more importantly, gaso-
line.

Based  on  current  and  expected  future  progress  we  believe  that
there  is  significant  growth  potential  for  ethanol  beyond  the  2012,
timeframe. Given the high-expected future demands for biofuels as
a major component of our nation’s fuel supply, we believe that bio-
ethanol  will  not  replace  today’s  corn  ethanol  industry.  Rather,  it
will  evolve  and  grow  from  it,  making  the  potential  for  ethanol  en-
couraging from both an economic and large-volume perspective.

Now, let me switch gears and talk about diesel fuels, specifically
biodiesel  and  renewable  diesel,  which  can  be  made  from  either
plant oils or animal fats, as well as biomass itself.

Biodiesel  production  is  a  currently  commercial  technology  which
takes  oil  or  fatty  feedstocks  and  converts  them  into  a  diesel  fuel
through  a  fairly  straightforward  process  called  transesterification.
Another process that shows a lot of promise for producing renew-
able  diesel  use  is  a  process  referred  to,  hydrogenation,  to  convert
the same oil or fatty feedstock into a diesel fuel.

Although  these  processes  are  straightforward,  the  problem  with
these  approaches  is  the  general  consensus  that  the  production  vol-
umes  can  only  ultimately  reach  two  to  four  billion  gallons  a  year
because  of  the  very  limited  ability  to  produce  these  feedstocks  in
the U.S. Approaches for producing renewable diesel at volumes ca-
pable  of  supplying  a  significant  portion  of  our  diesel  demand  will
require technologies that can utilize more available feedstocks, spe-
cifically biomass.

13

Fortunately,  two  such  approaches  do  exist.  The  first  approach  is
biomass  gasification,  followed  by  a  process  called  Fischer-Tropsch
synthesis  to  produce  a  renewable  diesel.  Another  longer-term  ap-
proach is to develop an entirely new feedstock source for producing
oils at large volumes. Algae shows considerable promise in this re-
gard  and  is  potentially  capable  of  producing  oils  at  rates  up  to
10,000 times soybeans.

Although  this  is  very  encouraging  and  should  be  pursued,  this
technology needs significant work before achieving commercial via-
bility.  Together  these  two  approaches  for  producing  renewable  die-
sel,  combined  with  the  current  biodiesel  production  show  consider-
able promise for producing renewable diesel economically and large
volumes, similar to ethanol.

Finally,  let  me  address  the  need  for  biofuels  infrastructure.  Spe-
cifically  the  Department  of  Energy  has  sponsored  studies  on  infra-
structure  needs  for  large-scale  production  and  utilization  of
biofuels.  These  studies  have  specifically  looked  at  two  key  compo-
nents  of  infrastructure;  distribution  from  the  biorefinery  to  the  re-
fueling station, and then equally as important vehicle needs.

These  results  have  shown  that  the  current  biofuel  distribution
infrastructure is inadequate to handle large volumes of biofuels. To
reach  our  goals  of  producing  these  fuels  at  a  significant  scale  of
gasoline and diesel, these areas need to be addressed.

Additionally, the same issues hold for vehicles. Although current
generation  flex-fuel  vehicles  are  capable  of  utilizing  up  to  85  per-
cent  ethanol,  they  suffer  from  significantly  reduced  fuel  economy
when  utilizing  the  E–85  compared  to  conventional  gasoline.  Vehi-
cles specifically developed to take advantage of the high octane and
other  desirable  fuel  properties  of  E–85  could  potentially  not  suffer
from  this  decreased  fuel  economy  and  allow  us  to  utilize  the  eth-
anol more efficiently.

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address  this  committee  on

these important issues.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Foust follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THOMAS D. FOUST

Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to discuss important issues related
to the Nation’s energy policies as we move to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,
maintain  a  healthy  environment  and  fully  meet  the  energy  demands  of  the  future.
I  am  the  Biomass  Technology  Manager  of  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Labora-
tory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. NREL is the U.S. Department of Energy’s primary
laboratory  for  research  and  development  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency
technologies. I am honored to be here, and to speak with you today.

We applaud the Committee for its examination of alternative transportation fuels
to  reduce  our  dependence  on  imported  petroleum.  Researchers  at  NREL  have  been
working on biofuel technologies since our laboratory was founded in 1977. However,
it only has been recently that public policy has looked to biofuels as a way to reduce
our dependence on petroleum use in the near-term.

Recent  studies  have  shown  that  there  is  sufficient  biomass  potential  in  the  U.S.,
and  worldwide,  to  produce  significant  amounts  of  transportation  fuels  without  im-
pacting food production—enough to displace a major portion of the petroleum we use
today. Clearly, this is an area that has great promise; but it must be done correctly.
The  Committee  has  asked  what  our  nation’s  R&D  focus  should  be  in  addressing
the technical barriers to developing biofuels from diverse feedstocks. Let me address
this question first.

Biomass: A Plentiful Resource

14

While  much  remains  to  be  done,  we  as  a  nation  start  with  some  significant
strength.  The  biomass  resource  in  the  country  is  huge,  and  the  potential  for  it  to
grow is significant.

The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy looked at the ques-
tion of whether the Nation’s biomass resource could foster a biofuels industry large
enough  to  meet  a  significant  portion  of  our  nation’s  future  fuel  needs.  The  report,
now  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘‘The  Billion  Ton  Study,’’  for  the  first  time  confirmed
that  the  U.S.  could  yield  more  than  a  billion  tons  of  biomass  annually  for  energy
needs.  And,  importantly,  we  could  do  this  without  negatively  affecting  the  Nation’s
ongoing needs for food or fiber. This is significant because the 1.3 billion tons of bio-
mass that was forecasted contains as much energy as 3.5 billion barrels of oil.

I  should  emphasize  that  such  a  transition  to  biofuels  will  not  happen  overnight.
It  will  take  a  significant  and  sustained  national  effort  to  get  us  there.  Still,  ‘‘The
Billion  Ton  Study’’  clearly  demonstrates  the  biomass  resource  is  real,  and  large
enough  to  ultimately  replace  a  large  fraction  of  the  petroleum-derived  fuels  we  de-
pend  on  today.  DOE  is  in  the  midst  of  developing  a  vision  for  replacing  30  percent
of current motor gasoline with ethanol by 2030 and this should help guide us in re-
alizing the potential of biofuels.

Moreover,  the  resource  is  regionally  diverse.  We  envision  that  every  state  in  the
Nation  could  produce  biomass  and  could  benefit  economically  from  an  expanding
biofuels industry.

We also are encouraged by the fact that there already exists a strong and growing
ethanol  fuels  industry  in  this  country.  The  U.S.  currently  produces  more  than  five
billion gallons a year of ethanol, almost exclusively from corn grain, and the indus-
try is growing 30 percent annually.

To understand where we are today and where we need to go, we need to see eth-
anol technology issues and biomass resource issues as interrelated. To move the eth-
anol industry to where we need it to be, we have to move beyond corn grain as the
primary  biomass  resource.  One  of  the  most  abundant  potential  resources  we  have
is corn stover, the non-food parts of the corn plant, including the stalks, leaves and
husks. Other resources are forest thinnings, hardy grasses like switchgrass, and fast
growing trees.

To use these and other resources we need to perfect new technologies that convert

the cellulosic materials of the plants into fuel.
Current and Future Biofuels

First,  let’s  start  with  ethanol.  Production  of  this  alcohol  fuel  from  the  starches  of
corn  grain  is  a  well  established  technology,  and  accounts  for  almost  all  of  the  cur-
rent  5.5  billion  gallons  per  year  (bgy)  U.S.  capacity.  Additional  plants  that  are
planned  or  currently  under  construction  are  estimated  to  put  our  capacity  close  to
12 bgy within a couple years. The limiting factor is, of course, the feedstock itself—
corn grain. It is an important food and feed commodity in the U.S., and most believe
that  we  cannot  produce  more  than  12–15  bgy  of  ethanol  from  corn  grain  without
having  significant,  unacceptable  impacts  on  the  economics  of  the  other  critical  corn
grain products.

There  are  no  other  realistic  starch  or  sugar-based  crops  in  the  U.S.  from  which
to  ferment  alcohol  in  quantity.  The  Brazilians  use  sugar  cane  and  in  other  parts
of the world, sugar beets are used as a feedstock, but these sugar crops can probably
never  be  widely  grown  in  the  U.S.  because  of  climate  differences.  One  or  two  bgy
in  the  U.S.  is  possible  from  sugar  crops  in  the  next  decade,  but  significant  growth
beyond  this  amount  from  this  resource  will  likely  never  be  a  major  factor  for  us.
Cellulosic  ethanol  promises  to  leap  these  ethanol  capacity  hurdles  by  utilizing
feedstocks  which  are  abundant  and  do  not  compete  with  other  needs.  However,  the
technology  is  relatively  immature  and  we  have  little  more  than  a  few  pilot  plants
on  the  ground.  At  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  our  biofuels  focus  is
almost  entirely  on  advancing  the  cellulosic  ethanol  technologies  to  enable  competi-
tively  priced  ethanol  from  a  variety  of  feedstocks.  The  current  goal  is  to  attain  a
$1.31/gallon production cost by 2012 in order to make this ethanol pathway competi-
tive  with  the  corn  grain  pathway.  However,  to  get  the  production  ball  rolling,  DOE
has  recently  awarded  cost-shared  contracts  with  industry  to  establish  six  cellulosic
ethanol  biorefineries  which  can  each  process  approximately  700  tons/day  of  feed-
stock, each plant potentially producing 15–20 million gallons per year (mgy) of eth-
anol.

But, we still need to significantly improve the technology and reduce the costs for
industry  to  begin  major  cellulosic  biorefinery  construction  efforts.  For  that  reason,
our  projections—even  with  significant  incentives  for  the  ethanol  refiners  and  the
feedstock  growers—puts  our  national  capacity  at  2–5  bgy  in  10  years.  By  2022  or

2023, however, the cellulosic biorefinery construction rate will be on a steep upward
slope,  with  a  significant  growth  potential  for  cellulosic  biofuels  beyond  2017.  This,
then,  is  undoubtedly  our  most  promising  pathway  to  meet  an  aggressive  national
alternative fuels standard.
Integration of Biorefineries into Existing Industries: The R&D Role

Another  exciting  area  of  work  is  in  the  development  of  ‘‘biorefineries.’’  Our  sci-
entists  at  NREL,  together  with  those  at  other  DOE  national  laboratories,  univer-
sities  and  corporations,  are  leading  the  development  of  fully  integrated  refineries
that use biomass, instead of petroleum, to produce fuels, chemicals, synthetic mate-
rials—virtually  all  of  the  products  we  use  from  a  conventional  oil  refinery  today.  It
is  envisioned  that  biorefineries  will  utilize  a  complex  array  of  processing  tech-
nologies to break down, convert and recombine a wide range of biomass components
into  fuels  and  chemicals,  in  a  manner  similar  to  how  petroleum  refineries  convert
petroleum  crude  oil.  We  envision  that  future  biorefineries  will  utilize  a  wealth  of
resources  that  we  currently  either  underutilize  or  don’t  use  at  all  today.  That  in-
cludes  agricultural  residues,  forestry  residues,  dedicated  energy  crops,  municipal
solid waste, algae and byproducts of the food and grain industry.

A range of biorefinery R&D is underway in partnership with industry. DOE’s bio-
mass  program  is  partnering  with  a  number  of  the  major  ethanol  technology  pro-
viders  and  ethanol  producers,  including  Abengoa,  ADM,  Broin  and  Cargill,  to  in-
crease the yield of ethanol from existing corn ethanol facilities and expand the slate
of feedstocks. In many ways, a cellulosic biorefinery can be viewed as an expansion
of a corn ethanol facility. That’s why we believe tomorrow’s cellulosic ethanol indus-
try will not replace today’s corn grain ethanol industry, it will evolve from it.

At the same time, DOE is partnering with chemical industry leaders, such as Du-
Pont, to develop new opportunities for producing both fuels and chemicals from bio-
mass.  DOE  is  partnering  with  the  forest  products  industry  to  explore  and  develop
biorefinery  concepts  that  can  integrate  into  existing  forestry  operations.  And,  most
recently,  NREL  is  partnering  with  oil  industry  technology  developers  to  explore
novel  options  for  integrating  biomass  streams  into  existing  petroleum  refineries.
These  and  other  partnerships  are  speeding  the  progress  of  new  technologies  to  the
marketplace, and may uncover new options for producing fuels from biomass.

Thermal  technologies  such  as  gasification,  pyrolysis  and  hydrothermal  systems
are  all  worthy  of  further  research  and  development  to  determine  how  these  tech-
nologies  and  the  respective  biofuel  products  impact  the  cost,  efficiency  and  integra-
tion into existing fuels infrastructure.

Before we leave the alcohol fuels family, let me mention at least one other of these
potential  fuels—butanol.  This  higher  alcohol  has  certain  advantages  over  ethanol.
In  particular,  its  energy  content  is  significantly  higher  than  ethanol  (but  still  not
that of gasoline) and it is has fewer water miscibility challenges than ethanol. How-
ever,  it  is  more  difficult  to  ferment,  and  the  economics  and  technology  are  well  be-
hind  that  of  ethanol.  You  have  probably  heard  that  BP  and  DuPont  are  beginning
a bio-butanol program in the United Kingdom. However, at least in the nearer-term
in  the  U.S.,  butanol  is  not  out  of  the  starting  gate  and  will  assuredly  be  a  minor
contributor  compared  to  ethanol.  In  addition,  the  challenges  of  establishing  a  fuel
infrastructure  for  one  new  major  fuel,  and  the  vehicle  and  engine  implications,  are
daunting  enough.  To  throw  a  second  alcohol  fuel  into  that  challenge,  I  would  pro-
pose, is not a good decision or investment in terms of moving up the alternative fuel
path as quickly as possible.
Biodiesel and Green Diesel Fuels

Diesel-like  fuels—biodiesel  and  green  (or  renewable)  diesel—can  be  made  from
plant  oils  or  animal  fats  and  greases  as  well  as  biomass  itself.  For  biodiesel,  the
oil  or  fatty  feedstock  is  chemically  reacted  with  methanol  in  a  process  called
transesterification,  which  splits  the  fuel  portion  of  the  feedstock  from  the  non-fuel,
glycerol  co-product.  This  is  a  fairly  straightforward  process  and  the  technology  is
proven and mature. Essentially this process is used to produce the entire non-petro-
leum  diesel  in  the  U.S.  today.  The  problem  is  that  our  current  capacity  is  only
around  500  mgy,  primarily  due  to  feedstock  limitations.  If  we  would,  for  example,
use every acre of the annual U.S. soybean crop to produce soy oil and then use that
to make biodiesel, our capacity would be only around three bgy. Remember that on-
road we burn 40 bgy in the U.S. today.

Green  or  renewable  diesel  is  an  emerging  technology  which  uses  the  same  oil  or
fats  feedstock,  but  instead  of  the  transesterification  process,  subjects  the  plant  oils
or fats to hydrotreating, as is done in the hydrocrackers of a petroleum refinery. The
advantages are that we can potentially utilize existing refinery assets and not have
to build new transesterification plants, and that the green diesel is essentially iden-

16

tical  to  petroleum  diesel  and  does  not  require  a  unique  or  new  fuel  handling  infra-
structure, nor vehicle or engine modifications. Another process that shows consider-
able  promise  for  producing  renewable  diesel  is  biomass  gasification  followed  by
Fischer  tropsch  synthesis  to  produce  a  renewable  diesel.  This  process  has  consider-
able  long-term  promise  since  it  utilizes  biomass  as  a  feedstock  and  is  not  subject
to the feedstock limitations of plant oils or animal fats of the other processes. I will
say  that,  from  a  technical  standpoint,  all  of  these  pathways  produce  a  diesel  fuel
which is not petroleum dependent and reduces CO2 emissions.

Another longer-term approach for producing a renewable or green diesel that gets
considerable press is to develop an entirely new feedstock source which has a higher
gallons-of-oil-per-acre  yield  and  can  be  produced  on  otherwise  non-arable  lands.
Algae  shows  considerable  promise  in  the  long-term—beyond  2017.  Whereas  soy-
beans  can  only  produce  about  50  gallons  of  oil/acre,  micro-algae  might  produce  sig-
nificantly  higher  yields  on  a  per  acre  basis.  Unfortunately,  this  technology  needs
significant work and will not contribute materially to the alternative fuels standards
under discussion, but in the longer-term may be a dominant component of our alter-
native diesel and jet fuel markets.
Biofuels Infrastructure: Research Needs

The  Committee  has  also  asked  the  panel  to  address  the  need  for  research  in  the

area of biofuels infrastructure.

DOE  has  sponsored  studies  that  have  examined  infrastructure  needs  for  large-
scale  production  and  utilization  of  biofuels  (i.e.,  20  bgy  and  greater).  These  studies
have  specifically  looked  at  the  two  key  components  of  the  infrastructure;  distribu-
tion  of  the  biofuel  from  the  biorefinery  to  the  refueling  station,  and  vehicle  needs.
The  results  have  shown  that  the  current  biofuel  distribution  infrastructure  is  inad-
equate to handle large volumes of biofuels, thus an improved distribution infrastruc-
ture is needed.

Two  options  are  available  for  accomplishing  this;  utilizing  the  existing  gasoline
and  diesel  distribution  infrastructure  for  the  distribution  of  biofuels,  or  developing
a  dedicated  biofuels  distribution  infrastructure.  Although  utilization  of  the  existing
gasoline  and  diesel  distribution  infrastructure  would  theoretically  facilitate  a
quicker,  less  costly  approach  toward  addressing  this  issue,  technical  challenges
exist—such as the miscibility of corrosiveness of ethanol. These challenges could be
addressed by a dedicated infrastructure; however the triggering mechanism to drive
investment in this dedicated infrastructure in not clear.

The  vehicle  issue  is  more  easily  addressed.  Currently,  all  U.S.  cars  are  capable
of utilizing 10 percent ethanol and studies are underway to see if these vehicles can
handle  higher  ethanol  blends  up  to  20  percent.  Flexible  Fuel  Vehicles  (FFVs),  in
contrast,  are  capable  of  utilizing  up  to  85  percent  ethanol.  FFV  sales  are  growing
rapidly  and  this  growth  rate  is  expected  to  increase  in  the  future.  Current  projec-
tions  show  that  the  vehicle  infrastructure  will  be  more  than  adequate  to  utilize  all
the ethanol being produced.
Fuel Fungibility

The  Committee  has  asked  whether  standardization  of  biofuels,  whether  ethanol
or  biodiesel,  is  needed  to  ensure  fuel  fungibility,  and  whether  the  standard  should
focus on blended stock optimization.

When  a  fuel  is  produced,  either  fossil  fuel  or  biofuel,  it  must  meet  standards  es-
tablished  for  its  sale  for  it  to  be  truly  fungible.  Ethanol  and  biodiesel  already  have
fuel  quality  standards  established  through  the  American  Society  for  Testing  and
Materials  (ASTM).  These  standards  have  been  created  to  partially  match  the  cur-
rent  production  methods  from  corn  starch  and  vegetable  oil  respectively.  They  help
to  establish  what  will  and  will  not  be  compatible  with  the  gasoline  to  which  they
will  be  blended.  If  the  predominant  process  for  making  ethanol  changes  (i.e.,  to
lignocellulosic  conversion  from  starch  conversion),  an  ASTM  committee  will  likely
want  to  examine  the  ‘‘typical’’  fuel  produced  to  determine  if  there  are  any  minor
components  that  could  potentially  be  present  that  wouldn’t  be  otherwise  using  to-
day’s technology, especially if they might be harmful to the engine performance.

The  standard  in  question  should  also  focus  on  gasoline  blend  stock  optimization.
For  the  example  of  E–10,  the  Reformulated  Blendstock  for  Oxygenate  Blending
(RBOB) must have certain properties so that the blend does not exceed Reed Vapor
Pressure  (RVP)  maximums.  For  E–85  there  may  be  an  opportunity  for  refiners  to
blend  in  low  octane,  high  RVP  gasoline  materials  and  still  comply  with  the  overall
specifications.

Workforce Requirements for Biofuels Technology Innovation

17

The Committee has asked the panel to comment on the need for trained personnel
to  form  the  biofuels  workforce  of  the  future.  Others  on  the  panel  may  comment  on
that, but let me address the topic from a research and development standpoint.

You  are  all  aware  that,  in  general,  the  U.S.  is  not  producing  the  numbers  of  sci-
entists and engineers that we need to stay at the forefront of global technology inno-
vation.  This  is  especially  true  in  the  energy  field,  as  well  as  in  the  particular  area
of biofuels and bioenergy.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory partners with many universities and
colleges,  and  we  bring  their  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  and  their  post-
doctoral  students  to  NREL  to  support  our  research  and  to  influence  them  towards
a  career  in  this  important  field.  But  that  is  not  enough.  We  need  a  concerted  na-
tional  effort  to  encourage  and  stimulate  our  young  men  and  women  to  become  en-
ergy  scientists  and  engineers.  Just  as  a  national  space  goal  dramatically  grew  the
numbers  of  aeronautics  and  space  scientists  in  the  1960’s,  we  need  to  elevate  our
energy challenge to that level such that our young people acknowledge and respond
to  the  call.  There  is,  perhaps,  no  more  important  undertaking  we  face  as  we  move
into  the  21st  century—ensuring  that  we  have  skilled  and  motivated  energy  re-
searchers to meet the Nation’s challenges.
Making Biofuels Information Available to the Public

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy
is funding NREL in late FY07 to create an on-line Biomass Data Center, which will
provide current, relevant data about ethanol and other biomass-derived fuels to sup-
port informed decisions by industry, policy-makers, researchers, and the public. The
Data  Center  will  be  an  extension  of  the  widely  recognized  Alternative  Fuels  Data
Center  (www.eere.energy.gov/afdc)  managed  by  NREL  for  DOE  since  1991,  which
provides  information  about  availability  and  utilization  of  biofuels  and  other  alter-
native fuels.

The new Biomass Data Center will gather and provide centralized access to infor-
mation on biofuels resources, production, and infrastructure issues, and will link to
existing information from DOE and other agencies to minimize costs and duplication
of  effort.  The  project  to  develop  the  Biomass  Data  Center  will  begin  in  FY07,  will
proceed in phases, and will entail ongoing maintenance and enhancements in future
years.  The  Data  Center  will  provide  easy  access  to  information  from  both  govern-
ment and the private sector on feedstocks, production technologies and facilities, in-
centives  and  regulations,  infrastructure  and  fuel  retailing,  and  market  opportuni-
ties.
Summary

Significant potential exists in the next decade and a half to reduce petroleum use
in  the  transportation  sector  under  an  aggressive  scenario  for  technology  develop-
ment and public policies to encourage deployment. The biofuels potential for a max-
imum petroleum reduction scenario in the next decade is large and, if fully realized,
will position biofuels for accelerated growth beyond 2017, putting our nation on the
path towards energy security with reduced CO2 emissions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR THOMAS D. FOUST

Dr.  Thomas  Foust  is  the  Research  Director  of  the  Biofuels  Research  Program  at
the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL).  In  this  role  he  guides  and  di-
rects  NREL’s  research  efforts  to  develop  biomass  conversion  technology  to  fuels  via
both biochemical and thermochemical conversion routes. This research is focused on
developing  the  necessary  science  and  technology  for  converting  biomass  to  biofuels
in  an  economical  manner  and  covers  the  gamut  of  fundamental  to  applied.  NREL
is  recognized  as  a  world  leader  in  developing  biomass  conversion  technologies  and
has won many prestigious awards recognizing our accomplishments.

Dr.  Foust  recently  led  an  effort  as  the  lead  author  of  a  team  of  biomass  experts
to  perform  a  detailed  assessment  of  a  scenario  in  which  30  percent  of  the  United
States  demand  for  light  vehicle  transportation  fuels  are  met  by  biofuels  by  2030.
This  landmark  study  investigated  all  aspects  of  the  supply  chain  from  feedstock
growth to vehicle needs and is in process of being published.

Dr. Foust’s research has focused on complex fluid flow and heat and mass transfer
processes  it  relates  to  fundamental  biomass  conversion  issues  for  both  biochemical
and  thermochemical  processes.  The  focus  of  this  research  has  been  on  identifying
areas  for  process  improvement  that  are  heat  and  mass  transfer  limited.  Prior  to
joining  NREL,  he  spent  seven  years  with  the  Idaho  National  Laboratory  (INL)
where  he  was  the  research  lead  for  the  biomass  feedstocks  program.  His  primary

area  of  research  was  in  complex  multi-phase  flow  analysis  as  it  related  to  physical
fractionation of biomass. Dr. Foust has over 20 years of research and research man-
agement  experience  specializing  in  biomass  feedstocks  and  conversion  research.  He
has  over  100  publications  in  the  biomass  field  covering  all  aspects  of  biofuels  tech-
nology.

He  has  a  Ph.D.  in  Mechanical  Engineering  from  the  University  of  Idaho,  a  M.S.
in  Mechanical  Engineering  from  the  Johns  Hopkins  University,  and  a  B.S.  in  Me-
chanical Engineering from the Pennsylvania State University. He also is a licensed

STATEMENT OF MR. JOHN BERGER, PRESIDENT AND CEO,

STANDARD RENEWABLE ENERGY; CEO OF BIOSELECT

Mr. BERGER. Chairman Lampson, Members of the Subcommittee,
my name is John Berger, and I am President and CEO of Standard
Renewable  Energy.  We  are  a  global  leader  in  renewable  energy,
serving  commercial  and  residential  customers  with  clean,  renew-
able  energy  and  energy  efficiency  technologies.  Standard  provides
one-stop shopping for solar, wind, biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells, and
energy  conservation  devices  on  a  nationwide  scale.  We  are
headquartered in the global energy city of Houston, Texas.

BioSelect  Fuels  is  a  division  of  Standard  Renewable  Energy  and
is  a  developer  and  operator  of  biodiesel  production  facilities,  offer-
ing the highest quality biodiesel fuel to the global marketplace. The
initial BioSelect plant is located in Galveston, Texas, as the Chair-
man  recently  just  pointed  out  in  the  introduction,  and  began  oper-
ations the last few weeks in May of 2007. BioSelect Galveston cur-
rently  produces  over  20  million  gallons  annually;  however,  expan-
sion  is  already  underway  to  take  the  site  to  over  190  million  gal-
lons by the first quarter of 2009.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  be  here  to  discuss  the  future  of
our  nation’s  biodiesel  industry  and  how  the  Biofuels  Research  and
Development Enhancement Act can help our country achieve its en-
ergy  security  goals,  protect  our  environment,  and  foster  economic
development through the expansion of renewable fuels.

America  relies  on  imports  for  60  percent  of  its  petroleum  needs.
Rising  crude  oil  prices  and  political  uncertainties  in  strategically-
sensitive regions of the world are focusing the public’s attention on
the  need  to  enhance  our  nation’s  energy  security.  U.S.  produced
biodiesel  expands  domestic  refining  capacity.  Every  gallon  of  do-
mestic,  renewable  biodiesel  reduces  the  need  for  imported  oil  be-
cause it replaces diesel fuel refined from imported crude oil.

The  biodiesel  industry  is  made  up  of  small  businesses  and  has
shown  steady  growth  over  the  last  15  years.  In  2006,  the  industry
produced  250  million  gallons  of  biodiesel.  Today  there  are  142
plants  in  operation  with  more  than  50  new  plants  under  construc-
tion or expansion, which will add an estimated new capacity of 1.7
billion  gallons.  The  industry  is  on  track  to  create  at  least  40,000
new jobs and add 24 billion at least to the U.S. economy.

Biodiesel  is  and  will  continue  to  be  a  strong  partner  in  the
growth of the biofuels industry and can be a substantial tool in the
Nation’s  overall  move  towards  energy  security  as  it:  directly  re-
places  crude  oil  that  is  imported  to  produce  diesel  fuel,  opens  up
much  needed  U.S.  refining  capacity,  decreased  greenhouse  gas

emissions,  contributes  to  cleaner  burning  diesel  fuel,  and  creates
jobs and stimulates rural and urban economies.

Standard  applauds  the  Subcommittee  for  its  comprehensive  ap-
proach  to  policies  that  will  lead  to  increased  education  and  ex-
change  of  information  on  research,  development,  and  demonstra-
tion of technologies related to the production of biofuels, the devel-
opment  of  biorefineries  and  the  demonstration  of  these  tech-
nologies.  The  Subcommittee’s  Discussion  Draft  emphasizes  the  im-
portance  of  active  research,  communication,  and  development  of  a
solid infrastructure towards building a strong biodiesel industry.

Our  industry  is  witnessing  a  period  of  dramatic  change  in  how
Americans create and consume energy. The overlapping public con-
cerns of national security, increased domestic energy independence,
global climate change, and rural economic development have led to
dramatically increased production of renewable fuels.

BioSelect believes it is imperative for the biodiesel industry to se-
cure a targeted fuel standard that sets an ambitious, yet achievable
goal  for  the  future  production  of  biodiesel  in  this  country.  Stand-
ards  should  be  designed  to  support  existing  biodiesel  capacity  and
be  progressive  to  encourage  continued  capacity  growth.  A  biodiesel
standard will aid to ensure short-term growth and long-term devel-
opment  of  a  sustainable  domestic  biodiesel  market.  We  are  con-
fident  that  a  federal  biodiesel  fuel  standard  that  seeks  to  displace
five percent of current domestic diesel consumption within the dec-
ade should be a principle policy objective for current legislative ac-
tion.  Such  a  goal  will  stimulate  the  demand  for  soybean  oil  and
other oils, will help spur the development of new domestically-pro-
duced feedstocks, will promote the development of production facili-
ties  in  all  regions  of  the  country,  and  will  encourage  automakers
to increase production of diesel-powered passenger cars for the U.S.
car market.

BioSelect  Fuels  provides  safe  and  superior  renewable  energy  to
consumers  in  a  clean  and  efficient  manner.  We  are  led  by  a  sea-
soned  team  and  supported  by  strong  partnerships  with  companies
such as Chevron Corporation and highly-regarded academic institu-
tions  like  Texas  A&M  University.  The  future  of  biofuels,  however,
and the means by which to create a viable source is highly depend-
ent  on  the  continuous  innovation,  research  and  development  in
both private and public sectors.

Support for longer-term clean energy goals will come by focusing
on  and  funding  a  portfolio  of  research,  development,  and  commer-
cialization  activities.  Standard  would  like  to  see  Congress  focus  on
solving technical problems to overcome barriers to biofuels growth,
including infrastructure, through forgoing or forging strategic cost-
shared partnerships with private industry, collaboration among rel-
evant  federal  agencies,  and  working  with  partnerships  in  the  dif-
ferent regions of the country to bring the promise of biofuels to fru-
ition. In addition, we believe that the next generation of feedstocks
and  production  technologies  should  receive  particular  attention  as
they are the foundation of the future of the biofuel industry.

With feedstocks accounting for approximately 60 to 80 percent of
the  entire  cost  to  produce  biodiesel,  BioSelect  and  our  allied  enti-
ties are focused on moving away from traditional edible oils and ex-
isting  arable  land  currently  used  for  the  cultivation  of  food  crops

such as corn and soybeans. Together, with the Engineering and Ag-
ricultural expertise of our partners at Texas A&M, we are actively
pursuing  the  development  of  biofuel  specific  crops  and  lesser-
known  seeds  that  can  be  grown  in  arid  lands  that  currently  lie  in
idle in regions of West Texas. Specific areas of research that would
benefit  our  industry  include  harvesting  techniques  for  new  feed-
stocks  where  manual  labor  costs  are  problematic  and  on  longer-
term feedstock envelopment projects such as oil-rich strain of algae
and other new sources that have been long recognized as abundant
possible feedstock sources for biodiesel.

Several  barriers  exist  before  existing  biofuels  can  be  realized
from  these  diverse  new  feedstocks,  but  there  is  a  lot  of  work  en-
abled to be done including looking at how to, you know, form these
arid lands.

I think I have—have I run out of time?
Chairman LAMPSON. You have.
Mr. BERGER. Okay.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Berger follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN BERGER

Good morning, Chairman Lampson and Members of the Subcommittee. My name
is  John  Berger  and  I  am  President  and  CEO  of  Standard  Renewable  Energy,
(‘‘Standard’’).  We  are  a  global  leader  in  renewable  energy,  serving  commercial  and
residential  customers  with  clean,  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  tech-
nologies.  Standard  provides  one-stop  shopping  for  solar,  wind,  biofuels,  hydrogen
fuel  cells  and  energy  conservation  devices  on  a  nationwide  scale.  We  are
headquartered in Houston, Texas.

BioSelect  Fuels  is  a  division  of  Standard  Renewable  Energy  and  is  a  developer
and  operator  of  biodiesel  production  facilities,  offering  the  highest  quality  biodiesel
fuel  to  the  global  marketplace.  The  initial  BioSelect  plant  is  located  on  Galveston
Island,  Texas,  and  began  operations  in  May  2007.  BioSelect  Galveston  currently
produces 20M gallons annually; however expansion is already underway to take the
site to over 190M gallons by the first quarter of 2009.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  pleased  to  be  here  to  discuss  the  future  of  our  nation’s  bio-
diesel industry and how the ‘‘Biofuels Research and Development Enhancement Act’’
can help our country achieve its energy security goals, protect our environment and
foster economic development through the expansion of renewable fuels.
Background

America  relies  on  imports  for  60  percent  of  its  petroleum  needs.  Rising  crude  oil
prices  and  political  uncertainties  in  strategically  sensitive  regions  of  the  world  are
focusing  the  public’s  attention  on  the  need  to  enhance  our  nation’s  energy  security.
U.S.  produced  biodiesel  expands  domestic  refining  capacity.  Every  gallon  of  domes-
tic,  renewable  biodiesel  reduces  the  need  for  imported  oil  because  it  replaces  diesel
fuel refined from imported crude.

The  biodiesel  industry  is  made  up  of  small  businesses  and  has  shown  steady
growth  over  the  last  15  years.  In  2006,  the  industry  produced  250  million  gallons
of biodiesel. Today, there are 142 plants in operation with more than 50 new plants
under  construction  or  expansion,  which  will  add  an  estimated  new  capacity  of  1.7
billion  gallons.  The  industry  is  on  track  to  create  at  least  40,000  new  jobs  and  add
$24 billion to the U.S. economy.

Biodiesel is and will continue to be a strong partner in the growth of the biofuels
industry  and  can  be  a  substantial  tool  in  the  Nation’s  overall  move  toward  energy
security as it:

• Directly replaces crude oil that is imported to produce diesel fuel;
• Opens up much needed U.S. ‘‘refining’’ capacity;
• Decreases greenhouse gas emissions;
• Contributes to cleaner burning diesel fuel; and
• Creates jobs and stimulates rural and urban economies.

Standard  applauds  the  Subcommittee  for  its  comprehensive  approach  to  policies
that  will  lead  to  increased  education  and  exchange  of  information  on  research,  de-

velopment  and  demonstration  of  technologies  related  to  the  production  of  biofuels,
the development of biorefineries and demonstrations of those technologies. The Sub-
committee’s Discussion Draft emphasizes the importance of active research, commu-
nication and development of a solid infrastructure toward building a strong biodiesel
industry.

Our  industry  is  witnessing  a  period  of  dramatic  change  in  how  Americans  create
and consume energy. The overlapping public concerns of national security, increased
domestic  energy  independence,  global  climate  change  and  rural  economic  develop-
ment have led to the need to dramatically increase domestic production of renewable
fuels.

BioSelect  believes  that  it  is  imperative  for  the  biodiesel  industry  to  secure  a  tar-
geted  fuel  standard  that  sets  an  ambitious,  yet  achievable,  goal  for  the  future  pro-
duction  of  biodiesel  in  this  country.  Standards  should  be  designed  to  support  exist-
ing  biodiesel  capacity  and  be  progressive  to  encourage  continued  capacity  growth.
A  biodiesel  standard  will  aid  to  ensure  short-term  growth  and  long-term  develop-
ment  of  a  sustainable  domestic  biodiesel  market  .We  are  confident  that  a  federal
Biodiesel Fuel Standard (BFS) that seeks to displace five percent of current domes-
tic  diesel  consumption  within  the  decade  should  be  a  principal  policy  objective  for
current legislative action. Such a goal will stimulate the demand for soybean oil and
other  oils,  will  help  spur  the  development  of  new  domestically  produced  feedstocks,
will  promote  the  development  of  production  facilities  in  all  regions  of  the  country,
and  will  encourage  automakers  to  increase  production  of  diesel-powered  passenger
cars for the U.S. market.
Biofuel feedstock research

BioSelect  Fuels  provides  safe  and  superior  renewable  energy  to  consumers  in  a
clean and efficient manner. We are led by a seasoned team and supported by strong
partnerships  with  companies  such  as  Chevron  Corporation,  and  highly  regarded
academic  institutions  like  Texas  A&M  University.  The  future  of  biofuels  however,
and  the  means  by  which  to  create  a  viable  fuel  source,  is  highly  dependent  on  the
continuous innovation, research and development in both private and public sectors.
Support  for  longer-term  clean  energy  goals  will  come  by  focusing  on  and  funding
a  portfolio  of  research,  development,  and  commercialization  activities.  Standard
would like to see Congress focus on solving technical problems to overcome barriers
to  biofuels  growth,  including  infrastructure,  through  forging  strategic  cost-shared
partnerships  with  private  industry,  collaboration  among  relevant  federal  agencies,
and  working  with  the  different  regions  of  our  country  to  bring  the  promise  of
biofuels to fruition. In addition, we believe that next generation feedstocks and pro-
duction  technologies  should  receive  particular  attention  as  they  are  the  foundation
of the future of the biofuel industry.

With  feedstocks  accounting  for  approximately  60  to  80  percent  of  the  entire  cost
to  produce  biodiesel,  BioSelect  and  our  allied  entities  are  focused  on  moving  away
from traditional edible oil feedstocks and existing arable land currently used for the
cultivation of food crops like corn and soybeans. Together with the Engineering and
Agricultural  expertise  of  our  partners  at  Texas  A&M,  we  are  actively  pursuing  the
development  of  biofuel  specific  crops  and  lesser  known  seeds  that  can  be  grown  in
arid  lands  that  are  currently  idle  in  regions  such  as  West  Texas.  Specific  areas  of
research that would benefit our industry include harvesting techniques for new feed-
stocks  where  manual  labor  costs  are  problematic  and  on  longer-term  feedstock  de-
velopment projects such as oil-rich strains of algae which have long been recognized
as a potentially abundant source of feedstock for biodiesel production.

Several  barriers  exist  before  realizing  biofuels  from  diverse  feedstocks,  including
but not limited to; access to more exotic seed crops, laboratory and equipment avail-
ability, open land and amenable farmers, length of time to conduct research and de-
velopment and overall cost of implementation.
Information and data sharing

Although  the  public  market  is  becoming  more  aware  of  biodiesel  as  a  fuel,  addi-
tional education is still necessary for business leaders to invest capital and advocate
for future biodiesel production facilities and distribution infrastructure. A great deal
of  ambiguity  exists  in  the  renewable  fuel  marketplace  today  due  to  the  fact  that
there  is  very  little  concrete  factual  data  assigned  to  specific  individual  fuels;  i.e.,
ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel.

Although  we  as  an  industry  are  diligently  working  towards  uniform  testing  and
standardized  fuel  criteria,  federal  monitoring  could  help  avoid  inconsistencies.  To
date,  uncertainty  in  the  industry,  negatively  impacted  biodiesel  sales  and  the  inte-
gration  of  biodiesel  fuel  strategies  in  public  and  private  fleets,  and  inhibited
progress towards meeting national renewable fuel goals.

22

The  EPA  is  currently  developing  a  complete  emissions  profile  for  biodiesel.  As
leaders  in  the  renewable  energy  sector  however,  we  ask  that  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  do  more  with  the  creation  of  a  centralized  database  benchmarking  and  com-
paring  all  renewable  fuels  independently  to  a  baseline  conventional  diesel  fuel.  We
as an industry will benefit tremendously from factual data which compares biodiesel
to conventional diesel. In addition, we believe it would be useful to have a scientific
and  factual  description  of  renewable  diesel  and  a  comparison  of  biodiesel  to  renew-
able diesel and a comparison of renewable diesel to conventional diesel.

Federal  coordination  and  cataloging  of  information  from  federal  research  on
biofuels  development  processes  as  well  as  other  aspects  of  the  industry  and  related
industries  will  be  essential  to  the  longer-term  goal  of  creating  mainstream  renew-
able fuel. Demystifying the fuels themselves will not only provide the general public
with  more  information  and  confidence  about  utilizing  renewables  but  also  assist
both  federal  and  State  bodies  in  defining  credit  structures,  future  industry  incen-
tives, and other programs to promote renewable fuels.
Research in Infrastructure

Standard Renewable Energy’s mission is to make it easy to use renewable energy,
and  for  BioSelect,  infrastructure  is  essential.  We  have  located  our  first  facility  in
the refining center of the United States because we believe in the logistical and dis-
tribution advantages that come along with our regional location. Our vision for Bio-
Select fuel is that of a low concentration blend of quality biodiesel into conventional
fuel to be distributed on a nationwide scale. In support of this goal, Standard would
like  to  see  a  number  of  infrastructure  activities  pursued  on  a  federal  level,  most
likely  through  coordinated  work  from  government  agencies  such  as  Department  of
Energy, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Regulatory Energy Commis-
sion,  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency.  Our  primary  focus  at  this  time  is
the continued research and development of low blend biodiesel pipeline batch move-
ments.  Successful  pipeline  analysis  testing  has  already  been  done,  on  several  dif-
ferent  pipelines,  on  several  different  occasions,  yet  we  as  an  industry  ought  to  be
more  involved  in  the  process.  BioSelect  is  eager  to  assist  with  this  exciting  project
and offer assistance to the Committee and relevant federal agencies to advance this
type of necessary testing. Additional specific research needs currently facing the in-
dustry include but are not limited to: feasibility studies on tankage, pipe and pump
options,  cold  flow  properties,  water  issues,  stability  testing  of  fuel  samples  and  ad-
vanced vehicle technologies. In addition, we believe there is a clear need for an over-
all  general  economic  study  of  capital  requirements  to  bring  biodiesel  to  local  retail
pumps nationwide.

The  goal  of  this  extensive  research  is  to  produce  the  data  necessary  to  gain  the
acceptance and approval from environmental agencies, engine manufacturers, public
and private sectors and most importantly develop consumer confidence from the re-
finery to the retail level where you and I buy our fuel each day.
Standardization

Standardization  of  all  biofuels,  is  imperative  to  ensure  fungibility  into  conven-
tional  fuel  pool  and  towards  longer-term  acceptance  as  mainstream  fuel.  Biodiesel
producers  and  marketers  are  primarily  concerned  with  two  American  Society  for
Testing  and  Materials  Standards  (ASTM)  International  standards,  ASTM  D–975,
which covers diesel fuels and may soon include biodiesel blends up to B5, and ASTM
D–6751, which sets the minimum standards for B100.

Implementation of these standards and continued growth of the industry requires
top engineers, the same individuals that we must compete against high paying large
Oil  and  Gas  companies  to  recruit.  In  our  Galveston  facility  we  have  been  fortunate
to find strong talent that were instrumental in taking us from construction to start-
up  but  we  are  already  finding  more  difficulty  in  identifying  qualified  workers  for
our  expansion.  BioSelect  views  market  stability,  and  targeted  education  and  out-
reach about biodiesel as keys to attracting good talent.

As  the  biodiesel  industry  develops,  the  demand  for  highly  skilled  trained  labor  is
on  the  rise.  Industry  professionals  have  observed  that  safety  concerns  have  been
raised  when  smaller  start-up  plants  have  shortcuts  out  of  ignorance  or  to  cut  time
and  cost.  In  October  2006,  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  re-
leased  a  report  showing  that  out  of  32  biodiesel  samples  collected  nationally,  half
failed  to  meet  ASTM  quality  requirements.  BioSelect  believes  that  each  and  every
U.S.  biodiesel  manufacturer  is  responsible  for  knowing  what  can  go  wrong  in  their
manufacturing  processes  and  how  that  can  lead  to  impurities  in  the  finished  prod-
uct. As a large-scale producer however, we at BioSelect know that compliance costs
money,  and  we  have  focused  substantial  time,  energy  and  a  great  deal  of  capital
on  the  implementation  of  first-class  safety  and  quality  assurance  on  all  aspects  of

our  facility,  from  the  people  all  the  way  through  the  process.  In  addition  to  the
training  of  operators  and  other  industry  personnel,  BioSelect  enforces  compliance
with  our  own  codes  and  have  an  internal  team  that  act  as  a  forum  for  exchanging
safety suggestions, violations, remediation and investigative reports, as exists in the
chemical industry. With over 300 years of experience in the petrochemical and refin-
ing industries, BioSelect knows that a unified approach to train workers while also
adopting best safety practices is nothing more than being on par with similar indus-
tries. This process has prepared both our facility and operators to meet the industry
standards set forth by ASTM. BioSelect is currently in the process of obtaining our
BQ9000 certification from the National Biodiesel Accreditation Commission (NBAC.)
According  to  the  National  Biodiesel  Board,  there  are  currently  17  accredited  bio-
diesel  producers  and  six  certified  biodiesel  marketers,  which  account  for  40  percent
of  the  biodiesel  production  capacity  in  the  United  States.  In  addition,  half  of  the
states  in  the  country  have  implemented  the  ASTM  D–6751  specification  as  part  of
their fuel quality regulations, and an additional 13 states are either planning to ac-
cept the specification or studying it. Ten states now proactively test biodiesel or bio-
diesel-blended fuels.
Conclusion

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  and  for  your  continued
commitment  to  expand  the  use  of  renewable  fuels.  Promoting  innovation  and
proactive  leadership  to  create  new  energy  sources,  like  the  added  domestic  refining
capacity  at  BioSelect  Galveston,  is  critical  to  meet  the  growing  energy  demand  of
the future and in securing our nation’s energy security. Standard Renewable Energy
looks forward to working with you to further develop this important legislation.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOHN BERGER

Four years ago, at a time of extremely low energy prices, Mr. Berger foresaw the
looming  global  shortage  of  traditional  energy  sources  and  knew  that  the  country
would  inevitably  be  forced  to  turn  to  renewable  sources  of  energy  to  serve  our  vast
energy  needs.  Given  his  background  in  the  traditional  energy  sector,  he  recognized
that  the  way  to  turn  renewable  energy  into  a  successful  enterprise  was  to  build  an
integrated  platform  that  could  readily  be  built  to  scale.  As  a  result,  he  created
Standard Renewable Energy.

Prior  to  Standard,  Mr.  Berger  founded  Contango  Capital  Management,  a  venture
capital  firm  focused  on  renewable  energy.  In  addition  to  Standard,  Berger  is  cur-
rently Chairman of Trulite Inc, a portable fuel cell company that is majority-owned
by  Standard.  He  has  more  than  eleven  years  of  experience  in  the  energy  industry.
In  2002  and  2003,  Mr.  Berger  served  as  an  advisor  to  the  Federal  Energy  Regu-
latory Commission (FERC) on distributed generation, demand response, information
gathering  and  application  issues,  investigations  and  trade  clearing/credit  issues  in
the North American energy markets.

Mr.  Berger  graduated  cum  laude  from  Texas  A&M  University  with  a  BS  in  Civil

Engineering and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Chairman LAMPSON. And we will get back with you and you can
put  some  more  of  that  stuff  in,  and  certainly  you  can  submit  all
of your written testimony for the record.

Mr. BERGER. Thank you, Chairman Lampson.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  are  welcome,  Mr.  Berger,  and  Mr.

Dinneen.

STATEMENT OF MR. ROBERT DINNEEN, PRESIDENT AND CEO,

RENEWABLE FUELS ASSOCIATION

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of
the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  the  privilege  of  being  here  again
today.

I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss the growth in
the  domestic  ethanol  industry,  the  increasingly  important  role  of
continued research and development for our nation’s biofuels indus-
try,  and  the  Committee’s  Discussion  Draft  legislation,  the  Biofuels
Research and Development Enhancement Act.

The  ethanol  industry  today  is  on  the  cutting  edge  of  technology,
pursuing  new  processes,  new  energy  sources,  and  new  feedstocks
that will make tomorrow’s ethanol industry unrecognizable from to-
day’s. Ethanol companies are already utilizing cold start fermenta-
tion, corn fractionation, and corn oil extraction. Companies are pur-
suing  more  sustainable  energy  sources,  including  biomass  gasifi-
cation and methane digesters. And there is not an ethanol company
that  I  represent  that  doesn’t  have  a  very  aggressive  cellulose-to-
ethanol research program underway.

The  Science  and  Technology  Committee,  the  Energy  and  Envi-
ronment Subcommittee in particular, can play an important role in
accelerating these efforts by promoting and targeting research and
development  funds  and  resources  appropriately.  Support  through
research and development to promote the commercialization of cel-
lulosic ethanol and to continue to build upon the existing industry’s
advancements  in  technologies  will  be  critical  to  the  future  growth
of the biofuels industry.

The Discussion Draft clearly reflects a concerted effort to identify
the  research  needs  that  must  be  addressed  to  facilitate  the  rapid
expansion  of  domestically-produced  renewable  fuels  such  as  eth-
anol,  bio-butanol,  and  biodiesel.  It  recognizes  that  challenges  re-
main, not just in biofuel production, but in developing biofuel mar-
kets  as  well.  The  Committee  is  to  be  commended  for  its  commit-
ment  to  meeting  the  challenge  of  imported  energy,  recognizing  the
potential  benefits  of  biofuels,  and  motivating  the  research  commu-
nity through this bill to provide a pathway that will provide a more
stable  and  sustainable  energy  future  for  all  Americans.  The  RFA
supports this effort but would offer the following suggestions to en-
hance  the  bill’s  effectiveness,  particularly  given  the  unfortunate
budgetary constraints this effort will likely face.

With respect to the Biofuels and Biorefinery Information Center,
if  the  center  is  intended  just  to  be  a  clearing  house  for  technical
and  commercial  information  about  biofuels  development,  I  would
suggest that there may already be federal and private resources for
that  mission.  If  you  envision  the  Center’s  role  to  coordinate  mul-
tiple, and at times conflicting, federal research efforts on renewable
energy,  it  could  well  serve  a  very  useful  purpose  in  streamlining
federal efforts.

Clearly,  many  of  the  concerns  raised  in  the  Discussion  Draft  as
issues with the transportation and storage of biofuels do not apply
to  ethanol  when  used  as  a  blend  component  in  today’s  gasoline.
Other biofuels that do not have the record of successful use and ex-
perience  that  ethanol  enjoys  will  certainly  want  to  evaluate  their
physical  and  chemical  properties  and  how  they  will  fare  in  the
transportation network.

And  as  ethanol  moves  beyond  just  being  a  blend  component  in
gasoline  and  into  E–85  markets  where  far  more  than  today’s  eth-
anol  is  being  used,  there  will  be  other  transportation  issues  that
will likely arise as well.

These analyses should be focused on the physical transport of the
products  and  provisions  requiring  an  access  of  environmental  im-
pacts should rightfully be left to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.

25

The  RFA  supports  the  Draft  Bill’s  Biofuels  Grant  Program,  and
we  would  recommend  expanding  funding  in  this  area  if  at  all  pos-
sible.  As  Dr.  Foust  mentioned  earlier,  we  need  to  move  beyond
grain  and  the  production  of  ethanol.  The  industry  is  working  hard
to  do  so,  but  more  work  clearly  needs  to  be  done.  Federal  efforts
to help that would be very, very useful.

The RFA also strongly supports amending Section 932 of the En-
ergy  Policy  Act  of  2005,  to  create  a  biorefinery  energy  efficiency
program.  This  will  be  particularly  important  as  State  and  federal
fuel policy gravitates towards a carbon matrix for fuel policy.

With respect to higher levels of ethanol blends, EPA has already
largely defined the scope of the analysis necessary to approve such
new  fuels  for  commercial  use.  EPA’s  testing  needs  are  focused  on
the drivability, durability, materials compatibility, and emissions of
these  blends.  The  study  envisioned  in  the  draft  bill  goes  beyond
what EPA would require to approve new fuels, creating a new and
higher  standard  for  ethanol  fuel  blends  than  other  fuels  that  may
enter the market soon. The RFA would suggest, therefore, that the
bill  track  EPA  protocols  for  a  review  of  higher  ethanol  blends  and
provide sufficient funding to expedite such a test.

Mr. Chairman, increasing America’s energy and national security
by reducing our dependence on foreign oil and continuing to expand
domestic  renewable  fuels  is  among  the  most  important  challenges
facing  our  country  today.  We  at  the  RFA  look  forward  to  working
with you and this Congress to develop the appropriate federal poli-
cies that will help us achieve those goals.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT DINNEEN

Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  My  name  is
Bob Dinneen and I am President of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), the na-
tional trade association representing the U.S. ethanol industry.

This  is  an  important  and  timely  hearing,  and  I  am  pleased  to  be  here  to  discuss
the growth in the domestic ethanol industry, the increasingly important role of con-
tinued  research  and  development  for  our  nation’s  biofuels  industry,  and  the  Com-
mittee’s  Discussion  Draft  legislation,  the  ‘‘Biofuels  Research  and  Development  En-
hancement Act.’’

The  ethanol  industry  today  is  on  the  cutting  edge  of  technology,  pursuing  new
processes,  new  energy  sources  and  new  feedstocks  that  will  make  tomorrow’s  eth-
anol  industry  unrecognizable  from  today’s.  Ethanol  companies  are  already  utilizing
cold  starch  fermentation,  corn  fractionation,  and  corn  oil  extraction.  Companies  are
pursuing more sustainable energy sources, including biomass gasification and meth-
ane  digesters.  And  there  is  not  an  ethanol  company  represented  by  the  RFA  that
does not have a cellulose-to-ethanol research program.

The  Science  and  Technology  Committee,  the  Energy  and  Environment  Sub-
committee  in  particular,  can  play  an  important  role  in  accelerating  these  efforts  by
promoting  and  targeting  research  and  development  funds  and  resources  appro-
priately.  Support  through  research  and  development  to  promote  the  commercializa-
tion  of  cellulosic  ethanol  and  to  continue  to  build  upon  the  existing  industry’s  ad-
vancements  in  technologies  will  be  critical  to  the  future  growth  of  the  biofuels  in-
dustry.
Background

Today’s ethanol industry consists of 120 biorefineries located in 19 different states
with  the  capacity  to  process  2.2  billion  bushels  of  grain  into  6.2  billion  gallons  of
high octane, clean burning motor fuel, and more than 12 million metric tons of live-
stock  and  poultry  feed.  It  is  a  dynamic  and  growing  industry  that  is  revitalizing
rural  America,  reducing  emissions  in  our  nation’s  cities,  and  lowering  our  depend-
ence on imported petroleum.

Ethanol has become an essential component of the U.S. motor fuel market. Today,
ethanol is blended in 50 percent of the Nation’s fuel, and is sold virtually from coast
to  coast  and  border  to  border.  The  almost  five  billion  gallons  of  ethanol  produced
and sold in the U.S. last year contributed significantly to the Nation’s economic, en-
vironmental  and  energy  security.  According  to  an  analysis  completed  for  the  RFA1,
the  approximately  five  billion  gallons  of  ethanol  produced  in  2006  resulted  in  the
following impacts:

• Added $41.9 billion to gross output;
• Created 163,034 jobs in all sectors of the economy;
• Increased  economic  activity  and  new  jobs  from  ethanol  increased  household

income by $6.7 billion, money that flows directly into consumers’ pockets;

• Contributed  $2.7  billion  of  tax  revenue  for  the  Federal  Government  and  $2.2

billion for State and local governments; and,

• Reduced oil imports by 206 million barrels of oil, valued at $11.2 billion.

There  are  currently  77  biorefineries  under  construction.  With  eight  existing  bio-
refineries expanding, the industry expects more than 6.4 billion gallons of new pro-
duction capacity to be in operation by the end of 2009.

Biofuels Research and Development Enhancement

The  Discussion  Draft  clearly  reflects  a  concerted  effort  to  identify  the  research
needs  that  must  be  addressed  to  facilitate  the  rapid  expansion  of  domestically  pro-
duced renewable fuels such as ethanol, bio-butanol and biodiesel. It recognizes that
challenges  remain,  not  just  in  biofuels  production,  but  in  developing  biofuels  mar-
kets as well. The Committee is to be commended for its commitment to meeting the
challenge  of  imported  energy,  recognizing  the  potential  of  biofuels,  and  motivating
the  research  community,  through  this  bill,  to  provide  a  pathway  that  will  provide
a  more  stable  and  sustainable  energy  future  for  all  Americans.  The  RFA  supports
this  effort,  but  would  offer  the  following  suggestions  to  enhance  the  bill’s  effective-
ness, particularly given the unfortunate budgetary constraints this effort will likely
face.
Section 1—Biofuels and Biorefinery Information Center

While  we  certainly  agree  Biorefinery  Information  needs  to  be  more  widely  avail-
able,  we  believe  this  function  is  more  appropriately  met  by  private  industry,  and
that limited federal dollars can be better utilized in other areas. Trade associations
and  industry-led  promotion  councils  have  traditionally  fulfilled  the  role  of  clearing-
houses  for  information  related  to  the  research  and  development,  and  the  commer-
cialization  and  deployment  of  technologies.  Certainly,  with  respect  to  ethanol,  nu-
merous organizations offer information related to the technology, financing, permit-
ting  and  construction  of  ethanol  plants.2 In  addition,  careful  consideration  should
be  given  as  to  how  to  best  coordinate  and  consolidate  the  work  already  being  done
by various federal agencies on biofuels research and development before creating ad-
ditional layers of bureaucracy. The RFA recommends a thorough review by the Sec-
retary of Energy of the existing public and private resources before determining the
need for a new information center.
Section 2—Biofuels and Advanced Biofuels Infrastructure

The U.S. transportation fuel market has been blending ethanol into our fuel sup-
ply for more than 30 years. Ethanol is now blended in 50 percent of gasoline nation-
wide. Indeed, over the past several years the ethanol industry has worked to expand
a ‘‘Virtual Pipeline’’ through aggressive use of the rail system, barge and truck traf-
fic.  As  a  result,  we  can  move  product  quickly  to  those  areas  where  it  is  needed.
Many ethanol plants have the capability to load unit trains of ethanol for shipment
to  ethanol  terminals  in  key  markets.  Unit  trains  are  quickly  becoming  the  norm,
not the exception, which was not the case just a few years ago. Railroad companies
are  working  with  our  industry  to  develop  infrastructure  to  meet  future  demand  for
ethanol. The biofuels industry is working closely with terminal operators and refin-
ers to identify ethanol storage facilities and install blending equipment. We will con-
tinue to grow the necessary infrastructure to make sure that in any market we need

production technology.

to  ship  ethanol  there  is  rail  access  at  gasoline  terminals,  and  that  those  terminals
are able to take unit trains.

Clearly,  many  of  the  concerns  raised  in  the  Discussion  Draft  as  issues  with  the
transportation and storage of biofuels do not apply to ethanol when used as a blend
component in today’s gasoline. Other biofuels that do not have the record of success-
ful  use  and  experience  that  ethanol  enjoys  will  certainly  want  to  evaluate  their
physical  and  chemical  properties  and  how  they  will  fair  in  the  transportation  net-
work,  however.  These  analyses  should  be  focused  on  the  physical  transport  of  the
products  and  provisions  requiring  an  assessment  of  environmental  impacts  should
rightfully  be  left  to  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  if  necessary  and  ap-
propriate.

With  respect  to  ethanol,  the  most  significant  infrastructure-related  research  and
development  need  to  advance  cellulose  and  other  bioenergy  feedstocks  for  biofuels
production  is  on  improved  collection,  storage  and  handling  systems  for  those  feed-
stocks. The RFA would encourage the Committee to expand this provision to include
research,  development  and  demonstration  of  the  transportation  and  distribution
needs of the emerging cellulosic ethanol industry.
Section 4—Bioresearch Centers for Systems Biology Program

As  mentioned  previously,  there  is,  and  will  be  for  the  foreseeable  future,  limited
available  funding,  so  an  increase  in  the  number  of  Bioresearch  Centers  to  11  from
the Energy Policy Act of 2005’s three is unnecessary. Perhaps five Bioresearch Cen-
ters—one for every Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts—would be more
appropriate.  There  is  already  a  great  amount  of  regionally-focused  research  being
conducted  at  universities,  federal  laboratories  and  other  public  and  private  institu-
tions  nationwide.  Increasing  the  pool  of  research  entities  that  would  compete  for
limited funds may further dilute efforts to commercialize and deploy these new and
emerging technologies.
Section  5—Grants  for  Biofuels  Production  Research  and  Development  in

Certain States

The RFA strongly supports the Draft bill’s biofuels grant program, and we would
recommend  expanding  funding  in  this  area  if  at  all  possible.  A  wide  variety  of  en-
ergy  crops  and  agricultural  waste  products  such  as  switchgrass,  myscanthis,  wood
chips and corn stover from many regions of the country must all be researched, de-
veloped  and  commercialized  as  additional  ethanol  feedstocks  to  realize  the  annual
production levels envisioned in the many proposals already introduced by this Con-
gress.  New  biorefineries  are  being  built  in  new  regions  of  the  country  everyday—
the East Coast, the Gulf Coast, the Pacific Northwest and even Hawaii. Grant pro-
grams  that  promote  geographical  dispersion,  such  as  those  included  in  the  Discus-
sion  Draft,  will  help  to  commercialize  cellulosic  ethanol  quickly  and  continue  the
trend  just  beginning  to  expand  ethanol  production  beyond  the  traditional  corn  belt.
Section 6—Biorefinery Energy Efficiency

The  RFA  also  strongly  supports  amending  Section  932  of  the  Energy  Policy  Act
of 2005 to create a Biorefinery Energy Efficiency program. This will be particularly
important  as  State  and  federal  fuels  policy  gravitates  toward  a  carbon  matrix  for
compliance.  Opportunities  for  both  grain  and  cellulosic  ethanol  production  will  be
enhanced by technologies that allow biorefineries to decrease energy costs by diver-
sifying  energy  sources.  Advances  in  research  on  the  development  of  processes  to
produce  alternative  energy  at  biorefineries  such  as  biomass  co-generation  and  bio-
mass gasification, and methane production through anaerobic digestors, will be crit-
ical to increase energy efficiency and reduce the energy consumption of biorefineries.
Section 7—Study of Higher Levels of Ethanol Blends

Ethanol  today  is  largely  a  blend  component  with  gasoline,  adding  octane,  dis-
placing  toxics  and  helping  refiners  meet  Clean  Air  Act  specifications.  But  the  time
when  ethanol  will  saturate  the  blend  market  is  on  the  horizon,  and  the  industry
is  looking  forward  to  new  market  opportunities.  As  rapidly  as  ethanol  production
is expanding, it is possible the industry will saturate the existing blend market be-
fore a meaningful E–85 market develops. In such a case, it would be most beneficial
to  allow  refiners  to  blend  ethanol  in  greater  volumes,  e.g.,  15  percent.  The  ethanol
industry  today  is  engaged  in  testing  of  higher  blend  levels  of  ethanol,  beyond  E–
10.  There  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  today’s  vehicle  fleet  could  use  higher  blends.
An  initial  round  of  testing  is  underway,  but  more  test  programs  will  be  needed.  It
should  be  noted,  however,  that  EPA  has  already  largely  defined  the  scope  of  the
analysis  necessary  to  approve  such  new  fuels  for  commercial  use.  EPA’s  testing
needs are focused on the drive-ability, durability, materials compatibility and emis-
sions.  The  study  envisioned  in  the  Draft  bill  goes  beyond  what  EPA  would  require

28

to  approve  new  fuels,  creating  a  new  and  higher  standard  for  ethanol  fuel  blends
than for other fuels that may soon enter the market. The RFA would suggest, there-
fore,  that  the  bill  track  EPA  protocols  for  a  review  of  higher  level  ethanol  blends
and provide sufficient funding to expedite such a test.

Higher  blend  levels  would  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  the  U.S.  ethanol
market,  without  needing  to  install  new  fuel  pumps  and  wait  for  a  vehicle  fleet  to
turn  over  in  the  next  few  decades.  It  would  also  allow  for  a  smoother  transition  to
E–85 by growing the infrastructure more steadily.
Section 8—Study of Optimization of Flexible Fuel Vehicles

As  flexible  fuel  vehicle  (FFV)  production  is  ramped  up,  it  is  important  to  encour-
age the use of the most efficient technologies. Some FFVs today experience a reduc-
tion in mileage when ethanol is used because of the differences in BTU content com-
pared to gasoline. But the debit can be easily addressed through continued research
and  development.  For  example,  General  Motors  has  introduced  a  turbo-charged
SAAB  that  experiences  no  reduction  in  fuel  efficiency  when  E–85  is  used.  There  is
also  technology  being  developed  that  utilizes  ‘‘variable  compression  ratio  engines’’
that  would  adjust  the  compression  ratio  depending  on  the  fuel  used.  Thus,  if  the
car’s computer system recognized E–85 was being used, it would adjust the compres-
sion  ratio  to  take  full  advantage  of  ethanol’s  properties.  The  RFA  supports  the  fur-
ther study of how best to optimize technologies of alternative fueled vehicles to use
E–85  fuel  as  included  in  the  Discussion  Draft.  The  study  of  new  technologies  could
dramatically  improve  E–85  economics  by  eliminating  or  substantially  reducing  the
mileage penalty associated with existing FFV technology.
Conclusion

Increasing America’s energy and national security by reducing our dependence on
foreign oil and continuing to expand our domestic renewable fuels industry is among
the most important challenges facing our country. We look forward to working with
you  in  the  110th  Congress  to  develop  the  appropriate  federal  policies  that  will
achieve those goals.

Thank you.

DIRECTOR, ADVANCED BIOFUELS COALITION

Mr.  MCADAMS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Chairman  Lampson,
Ranking  Member  Inglis,  Members  of  the  Committee,  my  name  is
Michael  McAdams.  I  serve  as  Executive  Director  of  Hart  Energy
Government  Affairs  Group.  I  am  testifying  on  behalf  of  the  Ad-
vanced Biofuels Coalition.

It  is  a  great  privilege  and  responsibility  to  appear  before  you
today and to share how the members of the Advanced Biofuels Coa-
lition  are  contributing  to  meeting  our  energy  and  environmental

goals.  I  am  delighted  to  join  such  a  distinguished  panel,  some  of
whom I have worked with for years in the area of fuels policy.

The  Advanced  Biofuels  Coalition  is  a  group  of  companies  whose
second  and  third  generation  technologies  hold  great  promise.  The
companies, working with the Federal Government, have the poten-
tial to provide the American public with abundant values, volumes
of  high-quality,  no-compromise  renewable  fuels.  The  fundamental
objective  of  the  coalition  is  to  educate  policy-makers  on  the  ability
of these technologies to deliver significant volumes of lower carbon
fuels today and in the near future. For these companies to be able
to  achieve  this  goal  they  need  your  support  in  adopting  policies  at
the federal level which are technology and feedstock neutral.

We  applaud  your  efforts  to  provide  a  path  to  broaden  the  use  of
advanced  biofuels.  The  legislation  before  us  today  we  believe  can
make  a  significant  contribution  to  America’s  fuels  marketplace.
Our  members  recognize  the  tremendous  contribution  and  the  path
traveled  which  first  generation  fuels  have  already  made  and  will
play  in  the  future  of  this  effort.  But  we  believe  that  the  future  of
energy policy will require contributions from many sources. As one
Governmental official recently suggested, this is a matter of ‘‘silver
buckshot, not a silver bullet.’’

Members  of  the  coalition  have  reviewed  your  legislation  and
agree  that  many  of  the  provisions  would  be  helpful  in  moving  the
marketplace  forward.  Specifically,  we  are  most  interested  in  your
section regarding infrastructure and would encourage that you con-
sider the benefits that second-generation fuels would have in terms
of  reducing  the  overall  infrastructure  costs  to  the  country  and  to
consumers.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then with the remaining
portion of my five minutes I want to present the Committee several
slides  that  illustrate  the  potential  of  second  and  third-generation
technologies which use existing biofuel feedstocks.

The first slide depicts various technology pathways and potential
fuels  which  they  can  produce.  This  is  the  slide  version  of  the  oral
version that Dr. Foust gave.

The second slide presents a suite of technologies currently avail-
able  or  under  development.  As  you  can  see,  there  are  a  range  of
different technologies on the slide, all of which are renewable.

The  third  slide  briefly  depicts  where  many  of  these  technologies
are  currently  being  deployed  around  the  world.  To  the  extent  we
do not make technology-neutral policy choices in the current energy
legislation, many of these technologies may never find their way to
the United States.

The  fourth  slide  is  a  comparison  of  biodiesel  product  quality  as
it compares to several different technologies. You can see from this
slide  that  there  are  significant  quality  differences,  not  to  mention
fungibility  benefits  associated  with  second  and  third-generation
technologies. The fact that the basic chemistry of these products is
fundamentally different from first-generation biodiesel provides the
opportunity that jet fuels may actually be produced from these new
processes in the future.

33

The fifth slide attempts to show the potential of scalability of the
various  technologies.  As  you  can  see,  the  second-generation  fuels
which  are  sugar-based  and  biomass-based  give  the  country  signifi-
cant opportunity for large volumes.

34

The  last  slide  depicts  several  second-generation  alcohol  products
as  they  compare  on  energy  density,  volatility,  and  octane  with  the
current first-generation ethanol.

The  last  point  I  would  wish  to  make  to  the  Committee  concerns
the  desire  by  many  in  Congress  to  develop  a  Low  Carbon  Fuel
Standard.  Depending  on  its  specific  process,  feedstocks,  and  prod-
ucts,  an  individual  biorefinery  may  have  a  wide  range  of  life  cycle
carbon  emissions.  Should  the  Congress  seek  to  mandate  a  specific
biofuels  target,  it  should  provide  sufficient  flexibility  to  allow  both
the  objective  of  hitting  a  renewable  gallon  target  and  the  objective
of  having  a  low  carbon  fuel  supply  to  both  be  achieved  and  not  be
in  conflict  with  each  other.  To  do  so  would  put  the  consumer  at
risk.

In conclusion, we appreciate the opportunity to testify before you
today, and we stand ready to work with the Committee on the leg-
islation before us.

Thank you.

these companies to be able to achieve this goal, they need your support in adopting
policies at the federal level which are technology and feedstock neutral.

We  applaud  your  efforts  to  provide  a  path  to  broaden  the  use  of  ‘‘advanced

Questions from the Committee:

39

1. Is  a  greater  federal  investment  needed  in  biofuels  research?  Are  there  specific
areas  that  are  in  need  of  greater  research  focus?  What  feedstocks  are  presenting
the  greatest  long-term  potential  for  development  of  biofuels?  What  are  the  tech-
nical barriers to realizing biofuels from diverse feedstocks?
Answer:  Currently  many  of  the  new  second  and  third  generation  technologies
have  begun  in  the  laboratories  from  colleges  and  universities  around  the  country.
We  would  encourage  the  Committee  to  continue  to  encourage  and  foster  public  pri-
vate-partnerships  with  industry  and  governments  to  make  the  new  discoveries  in
this area.

The  type  of  technology  and  choices  of  feedstocks  utilized  by  a  specific  processes
determine  their  specific  interest  in  any  given  research  focus.  In  addition,  the  types
of  process  will  have  a  direct  bearing  on  the  view  of  which  feedstocks  may  hold  the
greatest long-term potential for the development of fuels. Clearly for a company like
Amyris,  which  leverages  sugar  containing  feedstocks  to  create  hydrocarbon  fuels,
the  ability  to  utilize  forms  of  low  cost  sugars  from  cellulosic  processes  may  hold
great  promise.  As  for  a  company  such  as  Velocys,  which  is  developing  a  Fischer-
Tropsch process, woody biomass or slash from trees provides a great opportunity for-
ward.

Your  last  question  inquires  as  to  the  technical  barriers  to  realizing  biofuels  from
diverse feedstocks. In most cases, whether it is gasification or biotechnology, scaling
up the technology is one of the primary challenges. The government’s ability to pro-
vide  support  for  the  demonstration  of  technology  and  the  assistance  in  the  testing
of  fuels  to  meet  the  specification  for  different  engines  could  be  particularly  helpful
to  the  smaller  companies  involved  in  this  space.  Additionally,  food  oils  have  a  dis-
tinct  tendency  to  make  different  products  from  different  process  applications  and
have  different  quality  aspects  even  within  the  same  process.  This  creates  technical
barriers  to  transportation  and  engine  use  of  various  technological  applications  and
feedstocks for biofuels.
2. How will the business community benefit from better federal coordination and cat-
aloging of information from federal research on the biofuels development process?
Should  databases  and  a  centralized  clearinghouse  be  created  to  make  this  infor-
mation readily available?
Answer: To the extent the Federal Government is conducting its own research and
development, and it would catalogue and provide transparent access to a wide vari-
ety  of  stakeholders,  this  could  potentially  lead  to  partnerships  and  shared  tech-
nology developments that might not otherwise be forthcoming. Putting this informa-
tion into the marketplace at a time of high investment in these types of areas does
provide  for  the  potential  that  new  technologies  may  be  picked  up,  combined  and
moved forward in a more expeditious fashion.
3. Can  you  comment  on  the  need  for  research  in  the  area  of  biofuels  infrastructure?

What should be included in such research?
Answer: There are many new technologies that hold the promise to bring fungible
high quality diesel and gasoline components to the market on a cost effective basis.
The  legislation  should  explore  the  timeframes  for  these  alternatives  and  include
these fuel options in the studies for infrastructure requirements. It might be in the
Nation’s best interest to sequence the requirements for certain volumes of renewable
fuels  until  after  the  completion  of  these  studies  to  afford  the  potential  of  signifi-
cantly lowering any large investments which could be required to move massive vol-
umes of first generation fuels.
4. Is  standardization  of  biofuels,  whether  ethanol  or  biodiesel,  needed  to  ensure  fuel

fungibility? Should this standard focus on blend stock optimization?
Answer:  Various  technologies  make  differing  qualities  of  biofuels  and  as  a  result
require  different  infrastructure.  As  a  result  of  the  biofuels’  properties,  the  quantity
of renewable fuel that can be added as a component to either diesel or gasoline also
varies.  This  is  further  magnified  by  the  warranty  requirements  of  various  engine
manufacturers.

In  the  past  we  have  seen  certain  technologies  utilize  standard  requirements  at
state levels to attempt to block advanced biofuels with great potential from entering
the marketplace.

The Committee should be very cautious to not preclude the development of newer
higher quality options for consumers in the market place. We appreciate the interest
to  creating  a  standard  to  optimize  blend  stock  for  those  fuels  with  highly  variable

quality.  However,  depending  on  the  technology  and  the  product  involved,  the  level
and requirements needed to create a fluid system to deliver consistent finished prod-
uct  to  an  end  point  are  extremely  complicated  and  could  have  unintended  con-
sequences.  For  example,  requiring  U.S.  refining  in  the  system  to  make  changes  to
their  blends  could  require  significant  changes  to  the  base  stock  and  lower  the  opti-
mization of the current refining system.
5. Is the current workforce adequate to meet the growing needs for trained personnel
to  develop  and  operate  biofuels  facilities?  Is  a  comprehensive  workforce  training
program needed?
Answer:  Depending  on  the  technology  involved  governs  the  type  of  workforce  re-
quired. For most of our members, the existing personnel from either the ethanol or
refining  industries  have  provided  adequate  personnel  requirements.  However,  sup-
port  in  working  training  programs  is  something  we  would  welcome  as  a  way  to  in-
crease the supply of workers in the future with the knowledge to operate these new
technologies.

STATEMENT OF MR. DAVID WASKOW, INTERNATIONAL

PROGRAM DIRECTOR, FRIENDS OF THE EARTH, U.S.

Mr.  WASKOW.  Chairman  Lampson  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  appear  today
to  discuss  research  and  development  priorities  related  to  the  envi-
ronmental  impacts  of  biofuels  production.  My  name  is  David
Waskow,  and  I  am  the  International  Program  Director  at  Friends
of the Earth, which is a national environmental advocacy organiza-
tion  and  also  the  U.S.  arm  of  an  international  federation,  Friends
of the Earth International, that has groups in 70 countries around
the world.

In  the  U.S.  and  abroad,  as  you  know,  biofuels  are  often  viewed
as an essential solution to the linked challenges of global warming
and  our  dependence  on  oil.  If  done  right  and  at  the  appropriate
scale, biofuels can indeed make an important contribution to reduc-
ing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  while  also  improving  agricultural
sustainability,  protecting  natural  resources,  and  strengthening
rural  economies.  However,  these  results  are  by  no  means  guaran-
teed,  and  we  must  be  vigilant  in  ensuring  that  the  potential  of
biofuels is, in fact, achieved. Without a serious consideration of en-
vironmental  impacts,  increased  biomass  production  could  have  un-
intended consequences for water, air, and soil quality, water avail-
ability, and sensitive ecosystems and potentially could provide only
minimal benefits or even negative outcomes in terms of greenhouse
gas emissions.

As  biofuel  production  and  use  rapidly  increases,  a  robust  re-
search  and  development  program  addressing  environmental  im-

pacts  is  urgently  needed.  Perhaps  the  most  important  task  for  re-
search in coming years is to more thoroughly understand the envi-
ronmental impacts of biofuels production on a life cycle basis. Par-
ticularly, to determine the actual greenhouse gas emissions associ-
ated  with  production.  Life  cycle  analyses  should  estimate  the
greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated  with  the  entire  chain  of  pro-
duction  and  end  use  of  a  fuel,  including  impacts  associated  with
land  use,  feedstock  production,  fuel  processing  facilities,  transport,
consumer end use, and more. This research need is even more crit-
ical now given that pending legislative proposals create greenhouse
gas performance standards for renewable and alternative fuels. In-
deed,  getting  these  analyses  wrong  could  end  up,  upend  the  entire
policy framework and fundamentally undermine greenhouse gas re-
duction goals.

Unfortunately, however, the current generation of life cycle anal-
yses  including  the  well-known  GREET  model  out  of  Argonne  Na-
tional Laboratory, contain important uncertainties and land use-re-
lated  impacts  in  particular  are  poorly  characterized  in  these  life
cycle  analyses.  The  land  use  impacts  of  expanded  biofuels  produc-
tion will include shifting marginal, unused, or ecologically-sensitive
land  into  biofuels  production.  These  impacts  could  change  funda-
mental  assumptions  about  greenhouse  gas  emissions  for  biofuels
both domestically and internationally.

Indeed, the recent surge in corn ethanol production in the United
States  underscores  the  importance  of  examining  these  greenhouse
gas  issues  closely.  Based  on  estimates  from  the  Argonne  National
Lab,  the  per  acre  greenhouse  gas  benefits  from  corn  ethanol  pro-
duction  compared  to  conventional  gasoline  amount  to  0.6  metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

By  contrast,  clearing  an  acre  of  grassland  would  produce  45  to
80  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  and  converting  an  acre  of  for-
est will commonly release 200 to 300 metric tons. The implications
are  substantial.  In  essence,  to  make  back  all  the  greenhouse  gas
emissions  from  an  acre  of  land  converted  from  grasslands,  one
would have to grow corn on that acre for approximately 100 years.
Careful  analysis  of  the  greenhouse  gas  impacts  of  land  conver-
sion is also relevant for biofuels feedstocks other than corn, includ-
ing  biofuels  production  outside  the  United  States,  partly  intended
for  export.  In  southeast  Asia,  for  example,  the  palm  oil  industry
which  has  devastated  rainforests  and  wetlands,  is  increasingly
shifting  production  to  biofuels  for  export.  Similarly,  in  Brazil  rap-
idly-expanded  production  of  biofuels  is  likely  to  increase  land  use
pressures  in  ways  that  could  influence  the  greenhouse  gas  profiles
of those fuels.

In addition to the critical task of analyzing greenhouse gas emis-
sions,  life  cycle  analyses  should  also  be  expanded  to  address  a  full
range  of  potential  environment  impacts,  including  some  of  the
issues  I  described  earlier,  soil  quality,  water  use,  water  quality,
and so forth. Broader research on these issues is especially needed
for feedstocks other than corn.

In  addition,  if  we  hope  to  continue  the  growth  of  a  sustainable
biofuels  industry  in  the  United  States,  we  must  also  find  ways  to
steer the sector in directions that will be more compatible with our
environmental  goals.  Research  into  best  practices  for  the  cultiva-

42

tion  and  harvesting  of  feedstocks  will  be  especially  important,  and
the  research  agenda  should  permanently  include  issues  involving
crop diversification, including mixed perennial grasses.

Sustainable  practices  for  biofuel  processing  facilities  and  re-
search  into  the  impacts  of  biofuel  processing  facilities,  particularly
involving  energy  use  and  water  use,  should  be  a  priority.  And  re-
search and development for production alternatives is also vital, es-
pecially  for  small-scale  production  and  local  and  on-farm  use  of
biofuels.

Let me conclude by saying that we appreciate this opportunity to
address  the  Subcommittee  and  look  forward  to  working  with  you
to address the critical research and development agenda needed to
deal  with  the  environmental  impacts  of  biofuels.  An  intensive  re-
search  program  can  help  insure  that  biofuels  provide  the  benefits
we  want  while  also  avoiding  the  environmental  harm  that  would
undermine our fundamental objectives.

Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Waskow follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID WASKOW

Chairman Lampson and Congressman Inglis, thank you for the opportunity to ap-
pear  today  before  the  House  Science  and  Technology  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and
Environment  to  discuss  research  and  development  opportunities  and  priorities  re-
lated  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  biofuels  expansion.  My  name  is  David
Waskow,  and  I  am  the  International  Program  Director  at  Friends  of  the  Earth.
Friends of the Earth is a national advocacy organization in the United States found-
ed in 1969 and the U.S. arm of Friends of the Earth International, the world’s larg-
est environmental federation, with groups in more than 70 countries worldwide.

In  the  United  States  and  abroad,  biofuels  are  often  viewed  as  an  essential  solu-
tion  to  the  linked  challenges  of  global  warming  and  our  dependence  on  oil.  If  done
right and at the appropriate scale, biofuels can indeed make an important contribu-
tion to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving agricultural sustainability and
protection  of  natural  resources,  and  strengthening  rural  economies.  However,  these
results  are  by  no  means  guaranteed,  and  we  must  be  vigilant  in  ensuring  that  the
potential  of  biofuels  is  in  fact  achieved.  Without  serious  consideration  of  environ-
mental  impacts,  increased  biomass  production  could  harm  water,  air  and  soil  qual-
ity,  decrease  water  availability,  and  increase  loss  of  biodiversity,  wildlife  habitat,
and  sensitive  ecosystems,  while  providing  only  minimal  benefits  or  even  negative
outcomes in terms of greenhouse gas reductions.

Recent data regarding increases in the scale of biofuels production, as well as cur-
rent policy proposals aimed at significantly increasing the levels of biofuels produc-
tion, make the consideration of environmental benefits even more of a pressing con-
cern.  According  to  Department  of  Energy  data,  U.S.  ethanol  production  increased
from 3.4 billion gallons in 2004 to an annual rate of six billion gallons at the begin-
ning  of  2007,  and  annual  biodiesel  production  expanded  from  28  million  gallons  to
approximately  287  million  gallons  from  2004  to  2006.  Meanwhile,  annual  imports
of  biofuels  have  also  steadily  increased.  More  than  10  percent  of  fuel-grade  ethanol
came  from  abroad  in  2006,  despite  the  current  54-cent  per  gallon  tariff  on  ethanol,
and there has been an upswing in the construction of plants, such as a 100-million
gallon  per  year  facility  in  Washington  State,  designed  to  import  palm  oil  for  bio-
diesel.  Legislative  proposals  to  dramatically  increase  the  use  of  biofuels  in  the
United  States  to  more  than  30  billion  gallons  annually  would  accelerate  these  al-
ready existing trends both for domestic production and imports.

As  biofuel  production  and  use  rapidly  increases,  a  robust  research  and  develop-
ment program is urgently needed to ensure that we understand the full scope of the
environmental  implications  of  biofuel  production  and  that  investment  in  promising
technologies  results  in  significant  greenhouse  gas  reductions  and  the  best  environ-
mental  outcomes  possible.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  environmental  impacts
vary enormously by feedstock and the full life cycle of the production process. More-
over,  the  increased  scale  of  biofuels  production  itself  raises  important  questions  of
environmental sustainability, especially in terms of land use impacts. Research and
development efforts should consider these impacts thoroughly and help steer future

biofuels  production  in  a  way  that  can  maximize  benefits  and  minimize  environ-
mental harm.
Life Cycle Analysis

Perhaps  the  most  important  task  for  research  in  coming  years  is  to  more  thor-
oughly  examine  the  environmental  impacts  of  biofuels  production  on  a  life  cycle
basis, particularly to determine the actual greenhouse gas emissions associated with
biofuel production. At their best, life cycle analyses for greenhouse gas emissions es-
timate  the  emissions  associated  with  the  entire  chain  of  production  and  end-use  of
a  particular  biofuel,  including  impacts  associated  with  land  use,  feedstock  produc-
tion, fuel processing facilities, transport, and consumer end-use. The greenhouse gas
evaluation  of  renewable  fuels  on  a  life  cycle  basis  can  help  provide  the  underlying
technical foundation for policy options, particularly when the life cycle emissions are
compared to the life cycle emissions from conventional fossil fuel-based fuel. Particu-
larly  given  recent  legislative  proposals  that  would  base  renewable  fuel  mandates
and other fuel policies on the greenhouse gas profile of specific fuels, it is imperative
that life cycle analyses are comprehensive and accurate. Indeed, getting these anal-
yses wrong could upend the entire policy framework.

The  current  generation  of  life  cycle  analyses,  including  the  well-known  GREET
model developed at Argonne National Laboratory, examine a wide range of life cycle
contributors  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (including  not  only  carbon  emissions,  but
also  gases  such  as  methane  and  nitrous  oxide).  Unfortunately,  however,  even  the
GREET  model,  which  is  considered  the  pace-setter  for  greenhouse  gas  modeling,  is
inadequate  and  contains  important  uncertainties  that  must  be  addressed.  Many  in
the  scientific  community  have  echoed  our  concern  that  life  cycle  analyses  must  be
improved  to  address  the  full  scope  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  related  to  biofuels
production.

Land  use-related  impacts,  in  particular,  are  poorly  characterized  in  current  life
cycle analyses, and broader and deeper research is needed to quantify the full range
of parameters affecting greenhouse gas emissions. In their recent technical analysis
of  California’s  Low  Carbon  Fuel  Standard  for  the  California  Air  Resources  Board,
University of California professors Alexander Farrell and Daniel Sperling noted the
limitations of the GREET model in terms of land use change. The land use impacts
of  expanded  biofuels  production  will  include  shifting  marginal,  unused  or  eco-
logically sensitive land into biofuels production, potentially changing the underlying
assumptions about greenhouse gas emissions for biofuels produced both domestically
and  internationally.  The  scale  of  land  use  conversion  for  biofuels  production,  the
types  of  land  being  converted,  and  the  land  intensity  of  various  biofuel  feedstocks
will  likely  have  significant  impacts  on  greenhouse  gas  outcomes  in  ways  that  cur-
rent models do not fully account for.

The recent surge in corn ethanol production in the United States underscores the
importance of examining these greenhouse gas issues closely. USDA estimated that
corn acreage in the United States would increase by 15 percent, or 12 million acres,
during  the  spring  2007  planting  season.  Legislative  proposals  currently  under  con-
sideration would further increase pressure on land, expanding corn ethanol produc-
tion to as much as 15 billion gallons annually, an amount that would require using
land equivalent to half the current corn acreage in the country, or 45 million acres.
The greenhouse gas implications of this land use will depend on the types of land
that  are  used  for  such  biofuels  production,  including  whether  protected  lands  such
as  those  in  the  Conservation  Reserve  Program  are  retired  from  that  program  and
placed  into  ethanol  production.  Yet  even  if  the  land  put  into  biofuels  production  is
currently  farmed  with  other  crops,  the  use  of  that  land  is  likely  to  displace  some
level of existing agricultural production, including to production on vulnerable lands
outside  the  United  States.  Other,  indirect  impacts  that  might  occur  due  to  the  use
of  corn  for  ethanol  could  also  be  considered  in  a  comprehensive  life  cycle  analysis.
For  example,  when  an  acre  of  corn  is  diverted  for  ethanol,  livestock  operations
around the world will replace most of the corn in some other way, which on a world-
wide  basis  could  result  in  the  conversion  of  additional  land  to  agricultural  produc-
tion.

The greenhouse gas emissions related to the increased use of land for corn ethanol
production  could  be  quite  substantial.  Based  on  estimates  by  the  Argonne  National
Laboratory, the per-acre greenhouse gas benefits from corn ethanol production com-
pared  to  conventional  gasoline  amount  to  0.6  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equiva-
lent.  By  contrast,  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  estimates  that
clearing an acre of grassland would produce 45 to 80 tons of carbon dioxide equiva-
lent  greenhouse  gases  and  converting  an  acre  of  forest  will  commonly  release  200
to  300  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  equivalent  greenhouse  gases.  The  implications
of these data are substantial. Even small increases in the use of land converted from

44

grasslands or forests would undo the greenhouse gas benefits from corn ethanol pro-
duction on an acre of land. While it would be reasonable to amortize the greenhouse
gas  impacts  from  land  conversion  over  a  limited  number  of  years,  doing  so  would
not limit the quite significant immediate impacts of the land conversion.

Careful analysis of the greenhouse gas impacts of land use conversion is also rel-
evant  for  biofuel  feedstocks  other  than  corn,  including  for  production  outside  the
United  States.  In  Southeast  Asia,  for  example,  palm  oil  production  is  increasingly
shifting  from  a  focus  on  food  inputs  to  production  as  a  biodiesel  input.  Unfortu-
nately, despite palm oil’s high energy content, the production of palm oil is a major
source  of  destructive  land  use  patterns,  particularly  due  to  deforestation  and  wet-
land  conversion.  Nearly  50  percent  of  currently  productive  palm  oil  plantations  in
Southeast  Asian  countries  is  planted  on  land  that  was  recently  converted  from  for-
est,  releasing  substantial  quantities  of  greenhouse  gases.  Meanwhile,  a  quarter  of
all  palm  oil  plantations  in  Indonesia  are  established  over  converted  peatlands,
which  have  been  drained  and  often  then  burned  to  make  way  for  palm  production.
Wetlands  International  estimates  that  peatland  drainage  and  burning  in  Indonesia
contribute two billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, or eight percent of
worldwide carbon emissions.

Similarly,  in  Brazil,  rapidly  expanded  production  of  biofuels  is  likely  to  increase
land use pressure in ways that could influence the greenhouse gas profiles of those
fuels.  In  the  case  of  sugar  cane  production  for  ethanol,  which  already  occupies  13
million  acres  in  Brazil,  expanded  sugar  cane  production  could  take  place  on  the
country’s significant quantity of degraded and fallow land. However, many observers
believe  it  is  likely  that  expanded  production  will  also  increasingly  move  into  the
Brazilian  cerrado,  the  biodiverse  tropical  savanna.  In  addition,  sugar  cane  produc-
tion  in  Brazil  frequently  encroaches  on  previously  occupied  lands,  which  often  re-
sults  in  crop  and  livestock  production  relocating  to  land  converted  from  savanna  or
rainforest.  Meanwhile,  although  soybean  cultivation  for  biodiesel  production  in
Brazil  is  still  relatively  undeveloped,  the  potential  for  pressure  on  sensitive  lands
is significant. Soybean production currently occupies more than 22 million acres and
frequently drives widespread deforestation.

In addition to conducting more comprehensive analysis of the greenhouse gas im-
pacts  of  land  use  changes,  other  elements  of  greenhouse  gas  life  cycle  analyses
should also be strengthened. For example, one of the most significant remaining un-
certainties  in  life  cycle  analysis  is  the  impact  of  nitrous  oxide  emissions,  an  impor-
tant  greenhouse  gas  related  to  agricultural  production.  Several  potential  sources  of
nitrous  oxide  emissions,  including  the  use  of  crop  residues,  are  not  included  in  any
major  life  cycle  analysis.  In  addition,  greenhouse  gases  emissions  related  to  energy
use for irrigation are not included in the GREET life cycle analysis.

Beyond  the  critical  task  of  analyzing  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated
with  renewable  fuels,  life  cycle  analyses  should  also  be  expanded  to  address  a  full
range  of  potential  environmental  impacts  from  biofuels  production.  This  will  be  es-
pecially  important  in  order  to  compare  the  impacts  of  various  biofuels  in  terms  of
their  relative  impacts  on  soil  quality,  water  use,  water  quality  (including  such  crit-
ical  issues  as  nitrogen  and  pesticide  run-off),  air  quality,  and  protection  of  native
ecosystems,  habitats  and  biodiversity.  As  next-generation  renewable  fuels,  such  as
cellulosic ethanol, become increasingly viable both technologically and commercially,
it  will  be  critically  important  to  be  able  to  compare  the  entire  range  of  impacts  of
those fuels with conventional biofuels. In addition, analysis of the aggregate and cu-
mulative  environmental  impacts  related  to  the  growth  of  the  entire  biofuels  sector,
both domestically and internationally, should be developed.

Finally, one of the most significant gaps in research on the environmental impacts
of biofuels is the extremely limited set of feedstocks that have been analyzed in any
detail.  Broader  research  on  environmental  impacts  and  the  development  of  com-
prehensive  life  cycle  analyses  are  needed  for  a  number  of  feedstocks  other  than
corn—including  soy,  sugar  cane,  palm  oil,  canola,  native  grasses,  various  wood
sources,  straight  vegetable  oil  (including  waste  vegetable  oil),  and  crop  residues.  In
some  instances,  greenhouse  gas  life  cycle  analyses  have  been  conducted  for  those
feedstocks,  but  broader  and  deeper  analysis  would  add  significantly  to  the  under-
standing  of  the  greenhouse  gas  and  other  environmental  impacts  from  those  fuel
sources.  In  addition,  most  studies  of  biofuel  production  use  broad  averages  for  ana-
lyzing impacts and land-use intensity, rather than geographically-specific data. Var-
iability  across  regions  of  the  United  States  and  the  world  can  be  significant  and
should be included in these analyses.

Research and Development for Best Practices and Advanced Biofuels

45

It is increasingly clear that our domestic demand for biofuels far exceeds our sup-
ply  of  corn  for  conversion  to  corn-based  ethanol,  currently  our  major  source  of
biofuels in the United States.

Meanwhile,  the  recent  rapid  expansion  of  corn-based  ethanol  production  has
helped stir increased concern about the environmental sustainability of biofuels pro-
duction  more  broadly.  If  we  hope  to  continue  the  growth  of  a  sustainable  biofuels
industry  in  the  United  States,  we  must  find  ways  to  steer  the  sector  in  directions
that  will  be  most  compatible  with  our  fundamental  environmental  goals.  Research
and  development  must  tackle  the  challenge  of  promoting  best  practices  for  biofuel
production and facilitating the development of improved, advanced biofuels sources.
Research  into  best  practices  for  the  cultivation  and  harvesting  of  feedstocks  will
be  especially  critical  to  the  environmental  sustainability  of  biofuels  production.  Ex-
amples of the issues that research need to address include harvest timing and quan-
tities;  crop  rotations;  fertilizer  requirements;  use  of  appropriate  and  safe  chemicals
for  cellulosic  crops;  impacts  of  crop  residue  utilization;  potential  integration  of  no-
till  and  organic  farming  to  provide  the  greatest  possible  greenhouse  gas  and  soil
benefits; use of single-pass harvesting; and feedstock processing and handling meth-
ods for woody biomass and perennial grasses. The research agenda for best practices
should  also  prominently  include  issues  involving  crop  diversification  and  appro-
priate  mixes  (including  cultivation  techniques  for  mixed  perennial  crops).  A  recent
University  of  Minnesota  study  showed  that  diverse  perennial  grass  mixes  are  more
beneficial  in  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  other  environmental  impacts
than is the case with other approaches, including monocropping of switchgrass.

In addition, a research and development program for conventional plant breeding
of  cellulosic  and  other  feedstocks  could  help  develop  biofuels  that  are  less  land-in-
tensive  and  promote  environmental  sustainability  in  other  ways.  Pursuing  conven-
tional  breeding,  rather  than  using  an  approach  involving  transgenic  engineering,
would avoid significant controversy and trade-related disputes and would avoid con-
tamination of the food supply from genetically engineered biofuel feedstocks.

Sustainable  practices  for  biofuel  processing  facilities,  particularly  for  energy  and
water  use,  should  also  be  a  research  and  development  priority.  Research  on  the
most  effective  ways  to  use  biomass  for  powering  biofuel  processing  facilities  could
be particularly important to creating greenhouse gas and air quality benefits. In ad-
dition,  research  on  minimizing  water  use  by  ethanol  processing  plants,  which  cur-
rently use more than four gallons of water to every gallon of ethanol produced, will
be critical to limiting the potentially intense pressure that biofuels production could
place on water resources.

Research and development for improved fuel types is also critical. Potential alter-
native biofuel sources such as straight vegetable oil and algae have received too lit-
tle attention and should be made more central to a research and development strat-
egy.  Straight  vegetable  oil  (including  waste  vegetable  oil)  can  be  used  in  modified
diesel  engines  without  processing  into  biodiesel,  thereby  reducing  the  life  cycle
greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  would  otherwise  come  from  a  biodiesel  production
process.  However,  in  order  to  make  straight  vegetable  oil  technologically  and  com-
mercially  viable,  research  and  development  will  be  needed  for  vehicle  engine  modi-
fications.  Another  promising  fuel  source  is  algae,  which  can  likely  be  produced  in
substantial  quantities  for  biodiesel  with  significant  greenhouse  gas  reduction  bene-
fits  and  limited  environmental  impacts.  It  would  be  valuable  to  support  a  research
and  development  program  to  facilitate  production  of  environmentally-sound  and
commercially viable algae biodiesel.

Finally,  it  will  be  vital  to  support  a  research  and  development  agenda  for  small-
scale production and local and on-farm use of biofuels. Distributed technologies that
can  be  used  to  provide  local  co-generation  of  electricity  and  heat  and  to  produce
biofuels, particularly biodiesel, for on-farm use, should be priorities of this research
and  development  program.  Small-scale  gasification  technologies  for  conversion  of
cellulosic biomass also offer significant opportunities that should be explored. These
approaches  are  important  not  only  in  the  United  States,  but  can  also  be  developed
for  use  in  developing  countries  so  that  local  communities  in  those  countries  can
produce biofuels for their own consumption and economic benefit.

DISCUSSION

into  our  first  round  of  questions,  and  the  Chairman  will  recognize
himself for five minutes.

BIOFUELS INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr.  Dinneen,  surely  the  ethanol  industry  should  be  commended
for insuring adequate supply of ethanol available to all parts of the
country.  The  virtual  pipeline  through  multiple  modes  of  transport
has done an exceptional job in quickly moving product.

However,  the  discussion  of  significant  growth  in  the  use  of
biofuels generally, I am concerned that we will reach a point when
the  virtual  pipeline  will  meet  capacity.  With  the  introduction  of
larger quantities of biofuels wouldn’t it be more economical for the
producers,  the  blenders,  and  consumers  to  move  the  product
through pipelines if we know it is safe and effective?

Mr. DINNEEN. Potentially. Let me first say that I think analyses
have  been  done  by  CSX  Railroad  as  to  how  much  additional  rail
traffic  it  would  take  to  move  as  much  as  35  billion  gallons  of  eth-
anol, and their assessment is that that is 14,000 unit trains a year
that would be necessary. That certainly looks like a really big num-
ber  until  you  put  it  in  some  context.  It  is  actually  less  than  four
percent  of  the  total  number  of  trains  in  this  country.  So  if  moving
more  biofuels  into  the  motor  fuel  market  is  going  to  be  a  national
priority, I think finding four additional percent, you know, rail traf-
fic is certainly feasible.

But your question was more on the economics than on, you know,
the  logistics.  And  certainly  it  could  potentially  be  far  more  eco-
nomic to move product by pipeline. The question will be how is the
ethanol  industry  going  to  develop.  Is  it  going  to  develop  as  the  oil
industry has been, where much of the production is highly central-
ized in one region? Because now the pipeline system has been built
to  accommodate  gasoline  production  in  the  Gulf  Coast,  and  the
pipelines  flow  from  there  out  to  the  population  centers.  Well,  al-
ready  you  have  seen  the  ethanol  industry  expanding  beyond  just
the  traditional  Midwest.  We  have  got  plants  today  that  are  being
built  in  California.  They  are  actually  in  operation,  four  plants  in
operation  in  California.  There  are  more  plants  under  construction
in  Texas  today  than  are  under  construction  in  Illinois,  and  as  our
industry  develops,  you  will  see,  I  think,  expanding  production  ca-
pacity  in  all  regions  of  the  country.  So  you  might  not  have  a  con-
centration  of  production  that  would  make  pipeline  shipments,  you
know, feasible or more economic. I think you are just going to have
to see.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  If  we  are  ultimately  planning  to  displace  a
large  amount  of  petroleum-based  products  with  biobased  products,
shouldn’t  we  explore  using  some  of  that  petroleum  infrastructure
that becomes less utilized in order to move ethanol?

Mr. DINNEEN. Absolutely, Mr. Chairman. We should explore that
and  indeed,  it  is  feasible  to  do.  It  has  been  a  marketplace  issue
thus  far.  There  may  be  some  technical  issues  that  need  to  be  ad-
dressed, and this bill I think will help to identify those.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  were  nodding  your  head,  Mr.
McAdams.  Do  you  want  to  make  a  comment  about  it,  and  then  I
would like for Dr. Foust to comment on it.

Mr.  MCADAMS.  Yes,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  think  it  is  a  very  intuitive
question, because as you move forward and you look at the bills in
both  the  House  and  the  Senate  that  are  currently  proposed,  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:23 Mar 03, 2008 Jkt 035999 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061407\35999 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

Congress is trying to change the fundamental balance of where the
energy  comes  from  in  the  future,  and  so  we  are  looking  at  36  bil-
lion gallons of renewable fuels in the Senate, somewhere around 30
billion,  35  billion  in  the  House.  And  those  bills  sequence  the  time
in which the renewable fuels come into the marketplace. If you look
at  the  second  slide  that  I  laid  down  on  the  right  hand  of  the  slide
you  would  have  seen  all  the  timeframes  that  these  second  and
third-generation technologies could come into play. They are totally
fungible  in  the  existing  pipeline  system.  They  are  totally  fungible
with  existing  fuels.  Some  of  the  fuels,  the  gasoline  slide  I  showed,
some of those fuels could actually work in conjunction with ethanol
and be blended with ethanol.

So I think it is a very intuitive question, and I think your legisla-
tion  and  the  section  in  your  legislation  that  talks  about  how  you
would  blend  these  fuels  and  what  the  properties  are  and  what  the
benefits of those properties are, is particularly on target and timed
to show the benefits of those fuels being merged.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  These  aren’t  cost  competitive  yet  just  be-

Mr. MCADAMS. Some of them if, some of them would be very cost

cause they are available?

competitive. Yes, sir.

Chairman LAMPSON. Dr. Foust.
Dr.  FOUST.  I  would  highly  agree  with  what  my  colleagues  say.  I
think  it  depends  on  if  the  ethanol  industry  develops  more  decen-
tralized  than  the  petroleum  industry,  it  does  complicate  the  petro-
leum  model  for  ethanol.  However,  with  that  said,  I  think  there,
clearly  economic  studies  show  it  is  a  fraction  of  the  cost  to  move
fuel  via  pipeline  than  it  is  by  rail  or  truck,  and  that  is  significant,
and I think it needs to be investigated.

As Mr. Dinneen said, there are technical challenges with putting
ethanol  in  existing  pipelines,  but  those  are  predominantly  due  to
practices.  Currently  hydrocarbon  fuels  are  separated  by  a  water
slug  within  the  pipelines,  which  works  well  for  hydrocarbon  fuels,
gasoline,  diesel,  jet  fuel,  et  cetera,  but  ethanol  has  a  high  affinity
for  water,  so  it  will  absorb  the  water,  so  that  doesn’t  work.  That
would  have  to  be  investigated.  Corrosivity  would  have  to  be  inves-
tigated,  but  I  think  those  issues  are  solved  and  the  economics  do
justify it.

As  far  as  the  vehicles  go,  I  commend  the  section  in  the  bill  for
looking at optimizing vehicles on E–85. I think really to, that there
is  one  vehicle  out  there  made  by  Saab,  it  is  marketed  in  Europe,
it  is  not  available  in  the  United  States,  but  actually  gives  higher
performance  on  ethanol.  And  there  is  a  lot  of  data  that  shows——

Chairman LAMPSON. Ethanol blend?
Dr. FOUST. E–85. Actually, E–85. So predominantly ethanol. And
there is a lot of data out there that shows that we would not have
to  pay  the  one-third  penalty  on  current  gas  mileage  penalties  on
fuel-flexible  vehicles  that  are  optimized  to  run  on  gasoline  octane
in the high 80s, if we did specifically look at these vehicles and how
to  develop  them  and  what  the  public  incentive,  policy  incentives
would be to automobile manufacturers to make these vehicles.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much. The Chairman’s time

Member,  I  will  recognize  the  Full  Committee  Ranking  Member  for
five minutes. Mr. Hall.

BIOREFINERY TECHNOLOGIES

Mr. HALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That is me, isn’t it?
Mr.  McAdams,  your  slide,  I  was  fascinated,  I  guess,  with  your
first  slide,  and  we  all  look  for  production  dates  and  facts  about
them  and  time  and  what  is  the  time  certain,  and  of  course,  you
may not be able to give that, but could you give me a couple of ex-
amples  of  actual  companies  and  the  timeframes  which  they  are
going to be able to produce these new higher-quality fuels?

Mr.  MCADAMS.  Yes,  Mr.  Hall.  And  coming  back  to  Chairman
Lampson’s  point,  let  me  name  two  companies  that  are  very  fas-
cinating.  The  first  company  would  be  Amyris  Biotechnologies,
which  was  a  company  originally  founded  by  Bill  Gates,  a  grant,  to
try  to  solve  the  world  malaria  problem.  They  created  a  yeast  mol-
ecule  that  has  made  a  quantum  collapse  in  the  price  of  making
artemisinin,  which  is  the  drug  that  kills  malaria  in  eight  hours.
They  took  it  from  a  price  of  about  $2.50  a  pill  down  to  24  cents.
Well, the technology they developed is the same technology that is,
frankly,  used  in  my  colleague’s,  Mr.  Dinneen’s,  ethanol  plants
every day. And so instead of using a yeast molecule that he would
use today, you would simply plug and play, pardon the phrase, like
a new software in a computer. You would simply put their new and
improved yeast molecule in one of Mr. Dinneen’s plants, and it will
make a diesel fuel with all of the characteristics of the second-gen-
eration  fuels  down  to  30  degrees  below.  It  will  make  a  jet  fuel,  or
it will make a gasoline additive.

It  would,  therefore,  give  all  of  Mr.  Dinneen’s  clients  an  oppor-
tunity  to  have  a  complete  product  slate  rather  than  just  one  prod-
uct  slate  going  forward.  And  they  believe  that  they  will  be  able  to
bring it fully to market in three years.

Real  quickly,  one  other  company,  Neste,  out  of  Finland,  on  May
31  introduced  a  60  million  gallon  stand-alone  hydro-processing
summarization  plant  that  is,  that  can  take  100  percent  tallow  and
turn  it  into  99  cetane,  no  sulfur  diesel,  high-quality  diesel.  They
are  doing  it  today.  They  are  looking  in  the  United  States  to  see
whether there might be a place, Texas, Louisiana, or a place where
it might fit with the products.

MANAGING BIOFUEL FEEDSTOCKS

Mr. HALL. Thank you. And I go to Dr. Foust at this time. Doctor,
in your testimony you mentioned the forest products industry, and
I have a lot of that in the northeast part of the State of Texas and
my  district.  I  understand  that  they  have  a  concern  with  sustain-
ability.  If,  when  a  biomass  is  extradited  from  forests  that  are  not
sustainably managed, they feel that it is not carbon neutral, it adds
to  the  atmospheric  carbon  and  it  is,  therefore,  not  renewable  en-
ergy. So I guess I would have to ask you, would you agree that for-
est  lands  should  be  managed  in  a  sustainable  way  to  ensure  for-
estry  replacement,  forest  health,  and  adequate  supply  for  existing
and  future  generations  and  uses  in  order  to  be  considered  renew-
able?

Dr. FOUST. I would absolutely agree with that statement. I think
Mr.  Waskow  summed  up  that  very  well,  that  that,  for  this  whole,
I would extend your comment even beyond forestry into agriculture
and  all  sources  of  biomass.  In  order  for  this  to  be  sustainable,  the
feedstock  has  to  be  managed  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Carbon,
storage, the health of the soils, the health of the forest, that all has
to be considered.

I  think  on  the  positive  side  as  many  studies  have  shown,  that
can be done, and we can have sustainable biofuels with carbon neu-
trality, but it is a challenge, and public policy, I think, has to guide
that towards carbon neutrality.

THE RENEWABLE FUELS STANDARD

Mr.  HALL.  Thank  you.  My  last  question  is  to  Mr.  Berger.  I  no-
ticed  in  your  testimony  that  you  suggest  a  mandatory  biodiesel
standard of five percent be instituted so as to insure a sustainable
domestic  biodiesel  market.  Is  the  type  of  biodiesel  BioSelect  Fuels
produces not eligible under the current renewable fuel standards as
included in the Energy Policy Act we passed in 2005?

Mr.  BERGER.  Mr.  Hall,  no,  it  is  not.  Most  of  the  renewable  fuel
that is being standardized under that Act is ethanol, and biodiesel
or  at  least  the  market  participants  who  sell  the  petroleum  prod-
ucts,  whether  they  would  be  unleaded  or  diesel,  are  not  forced  to
blend or do not blend biodiesel by mandate into the petroleum die-
sel currently.

Mr. HALL. Then can you tell me how much biodiesel has contrib-
uted  to  meeting  the  required  volumes  under  the  renewable  fuel
standard?

Mr. BERGER. I can’t give you that exact number, but you can see
through  the  small  amount  of  consumption  that  is  actually  con-
sumed in the United States and reported by the National Biodiesel
Board, that it is quite a small amount of the petroleum diesel con-
sumed in the United States, which is about 60 billion gallons.

Mr. HALL. I may have follow-up questions, but I see the red light
on,  and  I  am,  Mr.  Chairman,  will  be  allowed  to  submit  questions
with some expectation of getting back——

Chairman LAMPSON. Well, and if you have——
Mr. HALL.—in a reasonable time?
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Yes,  and  if  you  have  time  to  hang  on,  we

are, I am sure, going to have more than one round.

Mr. HALL. Thank you, sir.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  The  gentlelady  from  California,

Ms. Woolsey.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOOD SUPPLY CONCERNS

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  As  we  are  here,  I  am
here  listening,  I  can’t  help  but  comment  that  as  we  get  started  on
this  really  huge,  huge  endeavor  to  become  independent  of  petro-
leum-based products, products in an economy that we are learning
has  been  disastered  for  our  national  security,  and  for  our  environ-
ment,  while  we  address  this  and  going  to  biodiesels  and  all  the
other  alternatives  we  have  for  generating  energy  in  this  country,
I  have  to  ask  a  question.  Is  carbon  neutral  enough?  I  mean,  don’t

50

we  want  to  make  improvements?  Because  the  measurements  we
are  comparing  with  have  not  been  very  healthy.  So  I  think  we
should  be  addressing  that  because  the  tradeoffs  are  big  here,  and
as  long  as  this  effort  is  going  to  be  so  gigantic,  and  it  is  going  to
be. Let us not leave out some very important steps and some stand-
ards and measurements that we are going to need to be addressing
down the line anyway, so we might as well do it up front.

So my first question is to Mr. Waskow. Thank you for being here,
and  I  am  particularly  concerned  when  we  talk  about  ethanol  and
corn ethanol about the land use issues. I have, you see, everything
becomes  personal  when  we  start  talking  about  anything  around
here. It starts being part of what does it mean to our districts. But
what does, this is going to mean, is meaning already? We are sub-
sidizing corn on all these acres all over the Nation for ethanol, and
my  dairy  farmers  can’t  afford  to  feed  the  cows,  and  we  know  that
the Mexicans can’t afford to make their tortillas.

Well,  would  you  comment  on  that?  I  mean,  are  we  finding  alter-
natives?  Is  this  a  tradeoff  that  is  even  worth  it?  The  corn  part  of
it.

Mr.  WASKOW.  Let  me  first  take  the  question  about  carbon  neu-
trality, and my answer would be that absolutely we have to do bet-
ter  than  carbon  neutrality.  If  we  are,  in  fact,  going  to  tackle  the
very serious challenge of global warming, we have to do much bet-
ter  than  carbon  neutrality.  I  think  that  low  carbon  fuel  standard
that California has adopted, in fact, points in the direction of tack-
ling that challenge in a serious way in terms of moving past carbon
neutrality.

I  would  just,  with  apologies  for  referring  to  the  other  chamber,
I would just note that the bill that is on the Senate Floor this week
has some helpful language on this question. It requires that renew-
able  fuels  would  have  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  com-
pared  to  conventional  fuels  by  20  percent.  We  have  been  pushing
for an even higher target for the fuels referred to in the Senate En-
ergy Bill as advanced biofuels. We think that those should have to
meet a target of 50 percent greenhouse gas reductions.

So  in  sum,  yes,  we  need  to  push  the  envelope  on  this  question,
especially  given  that  renewable  fuels  will  only  be  limited  percent-
age of the overall fuel supply. If we are going to make good on their
promise, they need to have substantial reductions.

On  the  land  use  question  I  think  it  is  going  to  continue  to  be  a
growing  dilemma,  and  I  would  just  note  that  in  addition  to  the
kinds  of  dynamics  you  have  pointed  to  and  that  I  mentioned  ear-
lier,  we  are  concerned  about  some  of  the  indirect  effects,  some  of
the  ripple  effects.  For  instance,  if  corn  continues  to  be  used  for
biofuels,  the  world  supply  of  corn  for  feed  will  diminish  as  you
noted.  It  is  likely  that  that  will  stimulate  soybean  production  in
Brazil,  and  soybean  plantations  in  Brazil  have  been  closely  linked
to rainforest destruction. They have put incredible pressure on the
rainforest  in  Brazil,  and  so  although  obviously  there  are  some  un-
certainties about whether this dynamic that I just described would
play out, I think we do need to keep our eyes very closely on these
questions. And I think it points to the need to think about biofuels
options  that,  in  fact,  are  less  land  intensive.  I  think  perennial
grasses,  for  example,  are  an  important  example  of  that  and  also  I

think  sources  such  as  algae  could  be  particularly  useful  in  this  re-
gard.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you. I have, yes, Mr. Dinneen.
Mr. DINNEEN. As a representative of the existing corn ethanol in-
dustry, let me assure you that I agree that carbon neutrality is not
adequate,  and  indeed,  I  would  suggest  to  you  that  the  renewable
fuel  standard  that  was  passed  in  the  2005  Energy  Bill  created,  in
effect,  a  surrogate  low  carbon  program,  because  according  to  the
GREET model that Mr. Waskow referred to earlier, the ethanol in-
dustry that is producing today realizes about a 20 to 25 percent re-
duction  in  carbon.  And  I  would  suggest  that  probably  underesti-
mates  the  carbon  benefits  of  the  existing  industry  because  it  was
based  off  of  an  energy  survey  that  was  done  on  the  industry  in
2002.  The  industry’s  getting  better  all  the  time,  but  I  think  abso-
lutely we need to do a lot more, and we are.

With  respect  to  the  land  use  issues,  again,  those  are  critical
issues.  The  industry  itself  recognizes  there  are  limits  to  what  we
are going to be able to do from grain, which is why we are pursuing
a cellulosic industry as hard. Corn is, indeed, being driven up today
because  of  the  expanded  market  opportunities  for  ethanol,  and
markets  are,  indeed,  having  to  adjust.  The  fact  that  farmers  re-
sponded  to  the  marketplace  and  planted  90  million  acres  of  corn
this year suggests we are going to see the largest corn crop in his-
tory. And I believe that there is certainly going to be adequate sup-
plies  of  grain  to  satisfy  the  demand  in  this  country  for  feed,  for
fiber, and for fuel.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Woolsey.  I  now  recognize

BIOENERGY RESEARCH CENTERS

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Perhaps Dr. Foust or Mr.
Dinneen  could  answer  this  and  others  if  they  want  to  take  a  shot.
As I understand it we have three bioenergy research centers estab-
lished  under  EPACT.  The  Draft  Bill  contemplates  the  addition  of
11  centers  as  I  understand  it.  I  am  wondering  what  would  be  the
focus  of  those  centers,  or  what  would  they  add  to  the  mix  of  the
three.  And  do  they  at  some  point  get  too  many,  or  is  it  the  more
the merrier? From three to 11 makes more the merrier or we start
losing,  becoming  then,  creating  then  a  coordination  challenge  be-
tween three to, actually, I guess it would be 14.

Mr. DINNEEN. Congressman, I sort of wish Dr. Foust would take
this, but I will jump into it, what the heck. I noted in my testimony
that,  you  know,  there  is  value  to  these  facilities.  I  do  sort  of  agree
with  the  premise  of  your  question  that  11  may  be  a  bit  overkill,
and I think our testimony suggests that one in each petroleum dis-
trict  might  satisfy  the  needs.  There  are  going  to  be  different  feed-
stocks  in  different  parts  of  the  country.  The  northeast,  northwest
is largely going to be a woody biomass opportunity. There would be
other  feedstocks  perhaps  for  other  fuels  as  Mr.  Berger  had  ref-
erenced  with  respect  to  some  biodiesel  feedstocks  that  might  be
available  in  Texas.  So  there  are  benefits  to  some  regional  centers
like that, but 11 might be more than what the current budget situ-
ation would suggest might be feasible.

Dr.  FOUST.  I  think  Mr.  Dinneen  summed  it  up  quite  well.  I  also
agree  that  three  going  to  14  does  seem  excessive.  I  think  Mr.
Dinneen’s  point  is  well  taken  that  there  is  all,  as  the  old  saying
goes,  all  biomass  is  regional  but  expandable  to  national,  or  what-
ever  the  statement  is.  I  forget.  But  as  far  as  different  feedstocks
in  different  regions  and  different  technologies  are  suitable  for  dif-
ferent feedstocks and enzymes have to be tailored to different feed-
stocks, there is, market conditions are different. I would agree with
Mr.  Dinneen’s  point  that  geographically  locating  these  per  petro-
leum  district  makes  sense  or  geographical  region.  Fourteen  does
seem excessive.

Mr. INGLIS. How many petroleum districts are there?
Mr. DINNEEN. Five.
Mr. INGLIS. What is a petroleum district? I don’t know.
Mr.  DINNEEN.  Now  there  is  a  good  question.  It  was  determined
by the Department of Energy many years ago. It was just typically
the  way  that  motor  fuels  travel  in  a  given  region,  and  it  is  a  term
that is used an awful lot by the refining industry because each pe-
troleum  district  will  have  perhaps  separate  and  distinct  fuel  qual-
ity standards. Mike is probably actually a better person——

Mr. INGLIS. And I guess it has to do with pipelines, too.
Mr. MCADAMS. Within a specific region.
Mr.  INGLIS.  All  right.  So  what  would  the  centers  do?  Somebody
want to tackle that? Are they into commercialization, are they into
the  scientific  breakthroughs  needed  for,  say  cellulosic  ethanol  de-
velopment?  What  is  their  focus?  Is  it  basic  research,  or  is  it  more
applied?

Dr.  FOUST.  I  will  take  a  stab  at  that,  answering  that.  I  think  it
is  more  applied.  I  think  the  existing  national  laboratories,  univer-
sities  that  are  focused  on  the  basic  research,  understanding  the
fundamental  challenges  to  economical  production  of  cellulosic
biofuels,  whether  that  be  ethanol,  biodiesel,  or  these  higher  alco-
hols, is done in, currently done, probably more resources are need-
ed,  but  currently  done  better  in  a  focused  effort  where  there  is  a
group of consolidated scientists. But as far as the applied, applying,
understanding  the  market  factors,  understanding  the  feedstock  di-
versity,  understanding  the  regional  issues,  citing  issues,  the  den-
sity and the logistics, those issues could appropriately be addressed
by these regional centers. And that would be a good usage of those
centers to take the macro technology and apply it regionally.

CELLULOSIC ETHANOL

Mr. INGLIS. And my time is almost up, but I wonder we are going
to  have  the  breakthroughs  in  cellulosic  ethanol.  Is  that  what  we
are, we got a high degree of confidence in that?

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Congressman,  absolutely.  I  had  the  privilege  of
visiting  a  cellulosic  ethanol  plant  that  is  currently  under  construc-
tion  just  a  few  weeks  ago.  It  is  being  built  in  Spain,  but  the  com-
pany  operates  four  ethanol  facilities  here  in  the  United  States
today  and  is  building  a  similar  facility  here  in  Nebraska  as  well
that is likely going to be open before the end of the year. I can re-
port  to  you  that  commercial  cellulosic  ethanol  production  is  closer
than conventional wisdom would suggest. There are a lot of compa-
nies  that  are  looking  at  this.  As  our  industry  has  grown  and  as

new capital has come into the industry, new intellectual capital has
come into the industry as well, and there are more companies that
are  looking  at  this  today  from  a  different  point  of  view  than  ever
before.  And  there  are  a  range  of  technologies,  whether  it  is  enzy-
matic conversion, which is what we are most familiar with, or gas-
ification,  which  is  what  they  have  been  doing  a  lot  of  in  Europe,
and  we  are  just  starting  to  get  behind  now,  or  some  other  tech-
nology.  I  can  assure  you  that  cellulosic  ethanol  production  is  very
close.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  are  welcome.  And  Dr.  Bartlett,  five

minutes.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much. I bought the first Prius car
in  Maryland.  I  bought  the  first  Prius  car  in  the  Congress.  I  have
an  off-the-grid  home.  Its  only  energy  comes  from  solar  and  wind.
So please accept what I am going to say in that light. I am an enor-
mous  fan  of  renewables.  But  having  said  that  I  think  that  unreal-
istic  expectations  are  really  hurting  us,  and  they  are  permitting
those who don’t believe what we believe to relegate us to the luna-
tic fringe.

Let  me,  for  example,  talk  just  for  a  moment  about  corn  ethanol.
I  am  sure  you  all  saw  the  article  in  the  Washington  Post  about
three weeks ago. I had done those back of the envelope calculations
a  long  time  ago,  and  I  didn’t  sign  onto  a  single  corn  ethanol  bill,
because  it  was,  I  was  afraid  going  to  be  a  cruel  hoax  as  it  turned
out  to  be.  If  we  used  all  of  our  corn  for  ethanol,  all  of  it,  and  dis-
counted  it  for  fossil  fuel  input,  it  would  displace  2.4  percent  of  our
gasoline.  And  they  noted  correctly,  if  you  tuned  up  your  car  and
put  air  in  the  tires  you  would  save  that  much.  So  we  have  made
essentially  no  contribution  to  relieving  our  dependence  on  fossil
fuels.

And  I  would  submit  that  maybe  we  have  gone  backwards  envi-
ronmentally,  because  what  we  are  going  to  do  is  to  take  land  out
of  agriculture  reserves  that  shouldn’t  be  farmed,  and  we  are  going
to put it into farming because there is a potential profit to be made
by  growing  corn.  Remember,  there  is  an  80  percent  of  all  the  en-
ergy  you  get  out  of  corn  is  represented  by  fossil  fuels  you  put  into
growing  the  corn.  So  we  may  have  gone  backwards  environ-
mentally  while  we  are  making  essentially  no  contribution  to  dis-
placing our reliance on fossil fuels.

And  I  am  concerned  that  we  are  going  to  be  in  this  same  place
on biomass. And our first testimony was said that we could do this,
that  is  get  this  more  than  a  billion  tons  without  negatively  affect-
ing the Nation’s ongoing needs for food or fiber. I would like to see
those analyses.

Our  top  soils  are  not  increasing  in  quantity  and  quality,  and
there  is  such  a  thing  as  tilth  and  the  need  for  organic  material  in
soil,  because  it  doesn’t  have  that,  it  isn’t  top  soil,  it  won’t  hold
water,  it  won’t  hold  nutrients.  And  I  am  very  concerned  that  that
switchgrass that we salivate over is growing this year because last
year  it  died.  Now,  maybe  switchgrass  is  kind  of  unique,  because  I
think most of the nutrients are transported back into the roots, but
most  other  crops  are  not  that  way.  And  this  year’s  crop  that  is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:23 Mar 03, 2008 Jkt 035999 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061407\35999 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

54

growing, of weeds is growing because last year’s crop of weeds died
and  is  fertilizing  it.  So  I  think  that  what  we  are  going  to  get  out
of biomass is going to be considerably less than we anticipate.

And  I  am  just  concerned  that  these  exaggerated  expectations

make us look silly, and I don’t want to go there.

Our first presenter noted that if we took all of our soybeans and
converted it into biodiesel, it would displace less then eight percent,
and  I  am  sure  that  is  gross  and  net,  maybe  that  shrinks  to  four
percent.  Am  I  right?  So  if  we  took  all  of  our  soybeans  and  made
biodiesel  out  it,  we  would  displace  four  percent  of  the  diesel  fuel
that our across-the-road trucks use.

I  am  just,  am  I  wrong,  Mr.  Waskow,  that  we  may,  in  fact,  be
going  backwards  environmentally?  You  know,  we  are  very  much
like the pioneer in our country who worried about the worm eating
the  tassels  on  his  corn,  while  the  wolf  was  eating  all  of  his  cows.
There  is  nothing  you  shouldn’t  worry  about,  about  fertilizing  his
corn,  but  he  really  should  worry  about  that  wolf  eating  the  cows,
shouldn’t  he?  And  I  just  think  that  we  are  focusing  on  the  wrong
thing  here.  We  need  to  do  it,  but  it  is  just  have  you  done  enough
to have left the other undone. Am I wrong?

Mr. WASKOW. Well, I think we certainly have the potential to go
backwards.  I  think  we  are  at  a  critical  moment  where  we  have  to
decide,  in  fact,  how  we  are  going  to  pursue  the  biofuels  sector  and
industry, and I think we do have an opportunity now to place envi-
ronmental  safeguards  on  the  sector  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  pro-
pel us forward. But I think our concern is that some of the legisla-
tive mandates may be running out ahead right now of some of the
science  and  also  almost  all  of  the  safeguards  that  we  are  going  to
need to insure that this does bring us to the potential we are hop-
ing it will.

I  would  just  add  that  establishing  targets  like  a  five  percent  of
all  diesel  requirements,  one  of  the  concerns  we  have  actually  has
to  do  with  imports.  If  you  establish  targets  that  can’t  be  met  with
productive  inside  the  United  States,  the  likelihood  is  that  we  will
start  importing  significant  quantities  of  feedstock  and  biofuels
themselves, and in many cases the ways in which those feedstocks
are produced is quite damaging. Indonesia and Malaysia with palm
oil  is  the  most  extreme  example,  but  I  think  other  instances  are
going  to  be  problematic  as  well.  And  so  I  think  when  setting  very
high  targets  for  use  we  need  to  think  about  not  only  where  it  is
going  to  come  from  in  the  United  States  but  where  it  may  come
from on a global level.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Bartlett.  I  will  now  yield

five minutes to Ms. Biggert.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am sorry I missed

the testimony, but I do have a couple of questions.

DOES RESEARCH NEED TO BE FEEDSTOCK SPECIFIC?

First  of  all,  does  our  research  on  the  efficient  production  of  eth-

anol from the cellulosic material need to be feedstock specific?

Dr.  FOUST.  Yes,  that  is  true  to  a  degree,  however,  you  can,  you
don’t  have  to  go  through  feedstock  by  feedstock.  You  can  group
them. For the enzymatic conversion fermentation, yes, the enzymes

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:23 Mar 03, 2008 Jkt 035999 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061407\35999 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

55

themselves  are  feedstock  specific.  However,  agriculture  grasses,
corn,  wheat,  switchgrass  tend  to  behave  very  similarly,  as  do  the
wood.  So  it  is  not  as  onerous  as  it  might  sound  that  you  have  to
develop  the  technology  feedstock  by  feedstock.  And  once  those  en-
zymes  are  developed,  they  are  fairly  easily  tailored.  For  the  gasifi-
cation  approaches,  no.  Those  are  not  feedstock  specific.  Those  are
general  technologies  that  work  across  the  feedstock  resource  base.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Well,  once  we  figure  that  out  then  will  it  take  a
markedly  different  or  marginal,  different  process  to  make  the  cel-
lulosic  ethanol  from  other  feedstocks?  I  mean,  will  it  be  so  nec-
essary that we would have to have a different center do that?

Dr.  FOUST.  I  don’t  think,  I  would  say  as  far  as  tailoring  the  en-
zymes to the specific feedstock and the mix of those enzymes, that
would  be  the  companies’  proprietary  advantage  that  deployed  that
technology. So as far as centers developing that and under govern-
ment funding, no, I don’t think that would be necessary.

MORE ON BIOENERGY RESEARCH CENTERS

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, the DOE is currently evaluating proposals to
spend 250 million over five years to establish and operate two new
bioenergy  research  centers  to  accelerate  the  basic  research  of,  and
development of cellulosic materials and ethanol and other biofuels.
So if the cellulosic ethanol is really feedstock neutral, do we real-
ly, and I know it was discussed about whether five should be or 11
was  too  many,  couldn’t  we  just  do  it  in  those  two  research  centers
that the Department of Energy is developing?

Dr.  FOUST.  Those  research  centers  are  actually  looking  at  very
fundamental  biological  breakthroughs,  what  they  refer  to  as  sys-
tems  biology,  where  you  take  the  current  three-step  process  that
we  are  talking  about  that  Mr.  Dinneen  talked  about  as  near-term
commercially  ready  to  a  single-step  process  that  produces  the  eth-
anol  at  rates  two  to  three  times  what  current  processes  are,  about
half the cost. And what they are really looking at is advanced tech-
nologies  to  get  down  to  processes  as  simple  as  corn  or  even  sugar-
based ethanol.

So  they  are  really  far-reaching  basic  research,  which  I  think  is
good. They are not specifically looking at tailoring specific enzymes
to  regional  feedstocks.  They  are  not  near  that  applied  type  of  re-
search.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Well,  it  sounds  like  you  are  saying  that  the  re-
search  that  Mr.  Dinneen  was  talking  about  is  more  advanced  in,
as long as it is specific feedstock, but the, what the DOE is looking
at  is  making  feedstock  neutral  but  more  advanced  basic  research
which  will  lead  to  be  able  to  do  probably  the  same  thing  at  dif-
ferent centers? Am I simplifying that too much, or is that——

Dr.  FOUST.  I  think  in  general  that  is  a  true  statement.  I  mean,
there  is,  I  guess  the  best  way  to  put  that  in  context  is  what  Mr.
Dinneen  and  what  I  were,  what  I  was  talking  about  in  my  testi-
mony  is  this  cellulosic  ethanol  technology,  the  first  generation  is
competitive with crude oil prices at about gasoline, crude oil prices
about $55 a barrel. If you look at projections, Department of Ener-
gy’s  as  well  as  the  National  Petroleum  Refinery’s  projection,  crude
oil prices are expected to drop into, if you truly believe those projec-
tions,  into  the  $40  range.  And  what  that,  those  advanced  tech-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:23 Mar 03, 2008 Jkt 035999 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061407\35999 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

nologies really enable the cellulosic ethanol not to go uncompetitive
as  crude  oil  prices  would  drop  into  that  range,  as  well  as  higher
yields, higher efficiencies with reduced environmental impacts.

I  think  that  is  a  long-winded  answer  to  your  question,  but  I
guess what I was trying to differentiate is there is a near-termness
and long-termness to those different——

BIOREFINERY ENERGY EFFICIENCY

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Then  my  other  question  would  be  does  it  make
sense  to  create  the  stand  alone  biorefinery  energy  efficiency  pro-
gram  rather  than  to  incorporate  it  into  the  research,  this  research
into  the  integrated  biorefinery  demonstration  projects  that  were
authorized  in  EPACT?  It  seems  like  we  are  trying  to  do  the  same
thing when we have already authorized this in 2005.

Dr.  FOUST.  The  way  I  understood  it  is  the  EPACT  2005,  espe-

cially the Section 932 provisions.

Ms. BIGGERT. 932D.
Dr.  FOUST.  Okay.  We’re  to  incentivize  near-term  deployment  to
address the risk of capital and investor ease and cellulosic ethanol.
However,  those  plants  that  are  being,  that  were  selected  by  DOE,
although  they  are  good  technologies  as  past  peer  review,  they  are
really,  you  know,  sub-optimal  as  far  as  competing  long-term  com-
petitiveness with gasoline.

So  all  sections  of  the  EPACT,  the  932  and  all  sections  address
both issues; the commercialization, the need to development to risk,
to  overcome  the  risk  hurdle  for  financial,  as  well  as  the  research
needed  to  make  the  technology  competitive  in  the  long  run.  So  I
would  think  based  on  the  economic  analysis  that  my  lab  has  done
and  others,  that  both  aspects  are  necessary  to  really  move  this  in-
dustry to long-term potential.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

BIOFUEL FEEDSTOCKS: RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND

ESTABLISHING STANDARDS

Chairman LAMPSON. You are welcome, Ms. Biggert. I now recog-
nize  myself  for  five  minutes  as  we  start  our  second  round  of  ques-
tioning.

For  Dr.  Foust,  there  has  been  a  great  deal  of  discussion  both  in
Congress and in the research community about other possible feed-
stocks with a growing focus on algae biomass. You noted that algae
shows  considerable  promise  long-term,  but  the  technology  still
needs  considerable  work,  and  I  was  hoping  that  you  would  elabo-
rate on this point to help give the Committee a better idea of what
technological  barrier  exists  and  where  research  should  be  focused
to  see  the  greatest  improvement  in  the  algae-related  technologies.
Dr.  FOUST.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  That  was  actually  a  good

question. I look forward to answering that.

I  think  the  real  challenge  is  developing  these  algae  strains.  The
strains  that  have  been  developed  are  native  strains,  and  they  are
biological organisms, which to get them to express oils, which is ba-
sically  fats,  you  have  to  starve  them.  They  will  only  express  oils
when  they  are  starved,  and  they  will  only  grow  when  they  have
plenty of nutrients. And the challenge to get this to be economically

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:23 Mar 03, 2008 Jkt 035999 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\061407\35999 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

57

viable is to get them to do both. So you have to get them to express
oils, fats, while they are also growing. And that is a significant bio-
logical  challenge.  The  scientific,  the  microbiology  community  of
which  a  lot  of  those  people  are  at  my  laboratory,  believe  that  can
be  done  and  believe  that  we  can  get  these  yields,  1,000,  10,000
times of the soybeans or other oilseed crops.

However,  they  realistically  put  that  at  about  a  five  to  ten-year
effort,  and  then  once  that  is  done,  then  they  are  grown  in  these
shallow-water ponds, and you have to develop, it is an easier chal-
lenge but it is an engineering challenge—ways to harvest them and
crush them so you can get the oil out at pennies per gallon to com-
pete with diesel fuels at the $1, $1.50 gallon range.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  noted  that  there  are  already  fuel  qual-
ity  standards  in  place  for  ethanol  and  biodiesel  and  these  stand-
ards  have  been  created  to  match  the  current  production  methods.
Once we get past the technological hurdles to the broad use of cel-
lulosic  ethanol,  surely  we  will  be  producing  ethanol  from  a  variety
of  feedstocks.  How  will  we  insure  that  fuels  derived  from  diversed
feedstocks  are  fungible?  Will  we  need  a  better  system  for  estab-
lishing standards since we will no longer be able to rely on produc-
tion  methods  of  one  item,  corn  starch,  and  how  will  we  be  able  to
insure  conformance  with  the  standard,  when  multiple  feedstocks
are use for fuel development?

Mr. DINNEEN. Dr. Foust may want to jump in.
Chairman LAMPSON. Okay.
Mr. DINNEEN. But just with respect to ethanol, ethanol is ethanol
no  matter  what  the  feedstock  is.  There  may  be  some  feedstock-re-
lated  issues  with  some  of  the  other  renewable  fuels,  but  you  can
produce  ethanol  from  corn.  It  is  the  same  product  as  if  it  is  pro-
duced  from  sugar  or  from  cellulosic  material  or  from,  you  know,
whatever.  And  the  specifications  that  has  been  developed  have
been developed for its performance characteristics along, you know,
through  a  process  with  the  refineries  and  the  automakers  through
the  American  Society  for  Testing  and  Materials  (ASTM).  So  there
really  aren’t  standards  issues  with  respect  to  ethanol,  but  Dr.
Foust or Mr. McAdams may want to comment on some of the other
renewables.

Mr.  MCADAMS.  I  would  say,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  if  you  look  at
the second and third generation, particularly renewable diesel tech-
nologies, that the standard they hit is D975, which is the standard
currently  for  diesel.  It  is  one  of  the  real  confusing  nomenclature
problems  we  have  in  this  debate  between  a  biodiesel  which  is  a
coined term that comes out of the tax law, and now you have a new
term renewable diesel, which is another coined term coming out of
the tax law, and then their third term is green diesel.

But  most  of  the  second,  third,  and  fourth-generation  processes
that make diesel whether it is Fischer-Tropsch or whether it is the
Amyris technology or whether it is Neste, they make a D975 diesel
spec,  which  is  through  the  tier  one  process  of  EPA,  and  they  are
very comfortable with going through that process.

Dr.  FOUST.  I  would  agree  with  what  my  colleagues  said.  Mr.
Dinneen  is  right.  One  of  the  beauties  of  ethanol  is  that  it  is  a  sin-
gle molecule fuel, so whether you make it from corn, sugar, or cel-
lulose,  it  will  be  the  same.  However,  there  will  be  trace  contami-

nants  that  when  it  is  distilled  and  standards  to  control  the  con-
taminant  levels,  the  water  levels,  pipeline  issues  would  be  desir-
able,  especially  for  blending  as  one  section  of  the  Bill  specifically
addresses,  the  lower  ethanol  blends  greater  than  E–10  but  less
than E–40. As those blends come into play, the gasoline standards
and  the  ethanol  standards  for  those  various  different  blends  will
need to be controlled. It will be more of an issue.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  now  call  on  Mr.

Inglis for his five, extra five minutes.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Foust, it is very excit-
ing what you were just talking about, about an organism that may
create or express oils at a faster rate. That is pretty exciting. What
is  the  best  thing  government  can  do  to  help  facilitate  that,  or  is  it
going  to  happen  because  the  marketplace  is  pushing  us  to  that?
Which  would  be  a  fine  answer.  We  are  from  the  government.  We
are  here  to  help,  but  if,  you  know,  if  we  can  help  by  not  helping
so much, maybe that is what we need to do.

Dr. FOUST. No. Thank you. That was a good question. I think be-
cause  that  is  far  from  being  a  commercially-viable  technology  un-
like corn ethanol or biodiesel where there really isn’t a rule for the
government beyond standards, it is commercially viable so it is ap-
propriate rule for industry to develop and deploy those technologies
as they are currently doing. Right now it clearly would be economi-
cally  unfeasible  to  deploy  this  algae  technology  without  these  im-
proved strains.

So I think the government’s role would be kind of, again, as was
accentuated  in  this  bill,  to  increase  the  funding  for  the  field  of
biofuels  in  general  of  a  significant  portion  of  this  to  go  in  these
high-potential,  high-risk,  high-payoff,  but  not  near  commercially
viable type technologies.

Mr. INGLIS. Mr. Berger.
Mr.  BERGER.  I  would  echo  those  sentiments,  and  I  think,  you
know,  one  thing  to  really  sit  back  and  kind  of  think  about  here  is
that  you  got  to  start  someplace,  and  I  think  you  have  heard  that
consistently  across  the  panel.  And  moving,  just  speaking  from  a
for-profit company such as Standard Renewable, we are starting in
what  is  economically  feasible  right  now,  at  least,  you  know,  with
the existing tax credits, and then we are more than happy to invest
our profits in these new technologies and be able to move them into
the  marketplace.  Nothing  would  please  us  more  and  our  share-
holders  to  have  the  kind  of  numbers  that  Dr.  Foust  spoke  about.
Those  are  the  kind  of  numbers  where,  you  know,  people  in  the  oil
business would get a little bit nervous to say the least.

But  at  the  end  of  the  day  what  is  that  really  going  to  require
from  companies  like  ours  to  the  government?  We  want  consistent
policy. We want to know that over the next few years that biodiesel
in  whatever  form  it  is  or  ethanol,  whatever  form  it  comes  in,  is
going  to  have  a  place  here  to  stay  so  that  we  can  go  in  and  take
those  profits  and  put  them  into  these  new  technologies  and  deploy
those new technologies.

Mr.  INGLIS.  I  suppose  that  the  fluctuation  in  the  price  of  gas,  is
that  a  larger  determinant  of  that  question  than  what  we  are  talk-
ing  about  there,  that  research  or,  I  mean,  in  other  words,  if  gas  is
$3 a gallon, you have got a business. Right? If gas is $1.80 a gallon,

59

I guess you don’t have a business. Right? I mean, don’t answer that
question. It might upset your shareholders but——

Mr.  BERGER.  No,  no.  I  am  very  happy  to  answer  that.  Actually,
you know, from, speaking from the biodiesel business, and I will let
the other, Mr. McAdams and others talk about their respective bat-
tlefields, it really depends upon just as it does in the crude oil busi-
ness.  You  know,  what  is  the  profitability  from  taking  a  barrel  of
oil,  whether  it  is  vegetable  oil,  whether  it  is  crude  oil,  and  con-
verting  that  into  a  product,  and  what  is  that  product  trading  for.
So  as  soybean  oil,  for  instance,  is  a  very-well  traded  commodity,
and I would also like to point out that the U.S. is one of the largest
exporters  and  in  some  cases  the  largest  exporter  in  the  world  for
soybean  oil.  The  world.  And  so  what  we  are  talking  about  here  is
we  are  going  to  keep  more  of  our  bean  oil  here  at  home.  We  are
not the importation of oils back into this country in a massive way.
At  least  we  don’t  anticipate  that  to  be  the  case  any  time  soon.  So
from  our  standpoint  as  long  as  it  is  fluctuating  with  that  bean  oil
price  and  in  looking  at  the  product  price,  it  doesn’t  necessarily
mean  that  crude  oil  has  to  be,  you  know,  or  crude  oil-based  prod-
ucts  have  to  be  $3,  a  buck  80,  two  bucks,  four  bucks,  whatever  it
is. It is really more of a market-based approach to profitability.

Mr.  MCADAMS.  I  would  say  across  the  whole  fleet  of  the  tech-
nologies  I  represent  whether  it  is  Fischer-Tropsch  or  Invomatic,
these people are trying to, they look at the price of crude, and they
are  trying  to  develop  a  range  of  technologies  that  can  compete
across  $40,  $50,  $60  crude  ranges.  And  a  $60  crude  solves  a  lot  of
technology problems because it gives them some headroom.

In  terms  of  your  specific  question  about  what  not  to  do  if  the
Congress chooses a standard and says, okay. To hit the RFS target,
you  have  got  to  be  ASTM  D–6751,  then  that  means  all  those  com-
panies  that  make  a  D–975  fuel  don’t  count  against  that  standard,
and  you  remove  the  certainty  and  the  investment  that  all  those
companies  want  to  put  in  the  marketplace  to  develop  these  fuels.
And  that  is  why  my  coalition  was  formed  to  just  try  to  request
technology neutrality across all of these frames, either the RFS and
others.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Ms. Woolsey.

MORE ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND FOOD SUPPLY CONCERNS

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Thank  you  for  the  second  round,  Mr.  Chairman.
Mr. Waskow, in your testimony you point out that we need to im-
prove  the  model  for  evaluating  the  impact  of  biofuels  on  the  envi-
ronment. How much funding do you think Congress would need to
dedicate  to  improve  this  model  and  get  the  results,  get  good  re-
sults?  I  mean,  real  results.  And  do  you  know  if  there  is  any  work
being done anywhere? I am creating a new model.

Mr.  WASKOW.  That  is  an  excellent  question.  I  don’t  know  what
would  be  required  in  terms  of  funding  to  address  those  needs.
There are a number of researchers around the country, not only at
Argonne but at other institutions and I am sure with federal fund-
ing  backing  many  of  them  doing  some  of  this  work.  But  it  is  clear
that  we  have  to  step  up  the  pace.  We  need  to  be  able  to  do  this
work not only for corn, which has been analyzed in some detail now

but  also  for  a  number  of  other  feedstocks  to  be  able  to  make  ade-
quate comparisons, and we need to be able to look better, as I was
saying, at sections such as land use changes.

I am happy after this to explore with colleagues and others what

the cost would be. I am sure it is not extravagant.

Ms. WOOLSEY. You know, I had a thought for any and all of you
if  you  wanted  to.  As  we  talk  about  the  different  forms  of  biofuels,
what happens when a farmer invests in say, I will use corn because
that  is  where  I  am  today,  and  all  of  the  sudden  there  is  a  much
better  way  to  make  ethanol,  and  this,  what  happens  to  that  corn
production? I mean, it is a real gamble, isn’t it?

Mr. DINNEEN. Well, the marketplace is going to do what the mar-
ketplace  is  going  to  do,  and  if,  indeed,  farmers  can  make  more
money producing miscanthus grass than corn, I mean, that is what
the,  you  know,  they  will  do.  It  is  a  risk  certainly  but,  you  know,
I  think  the  marketplace  hasn’t  yet  figured  out  what  the  next  gen-
eration  of  renewable  fuels  is  going  to  be.  There  is  a  lot  of  talk
about  bio-butanol  and  bio-butanol  could  be  produced  from  agricul-
tural feedstocks as well, and that might be something that farmers
would grow their feedstocks for.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  But,  I  mean,  we  cut  down  forests,  we  put  berries
out  of  business,  we  make  it  impossible  for  the  Mexicans  to  have
corn  tortillas,  and  then  we  decide  corn  is  not  it  or  one  of  these
other feedstocks you had talked about. Risks?

Mr. DINNEEN. You mentioned the tortilla issue a couple of times,

and I appreciate that that has——

Ms. WOOLSEY. I worry about that obviously.
Mr.  DINNEEN.—been  one  of  those  things  that  has  been  in  the
media, but it is, there is a lot of analysis out there that would sug-
gest  a  three-cent  per  pound  increase  in  the  price  of  yellow  corn  is
not  responsible  for  an  80-cent  increase  in  the  price  of  white  corn
in  Mexico.  There  are  lots  of  reasons  why  the  Mexican  market  is
doing  the  things  that  it  is  doing  and  the  relationship  to  the  in-
creased  demand  for  ethanol  from  corn  production  is  not  a  really
strong  relationship.  But  I  understand  your  point  that,  you  know,
we  are  putting  a  lot  of  stock  right  now  in  ethanol  from  grain,  but
I  would  say  to  you  and  to  Congressman  Bartlett  as  well  that  corn
ethanol,  the  existing  ethanol  industry  is  not  the  end  of  this  road.
It is the beginning. This industry is providing the foundation upon
which  we  can  grow  a  more  sustainable  and  more  economic  renew-
able industry in the future.

And I appreciate that there are concerns with the existing indus-
try  today,  but  don’t  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  it  is  just  the  begin-
ning,  and  it  is  not  a  cruel  hoax.  It  is  the  foundation  upon  which
this nation is going to become more energy secure.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Berger.
Mr.  BERGER.  I  would  like  to  echo.  Here  are  some  numbers  to
think  about,  and  they  are  quite  scary.  If  you  look  at  the  energy
issues that we face, they are more grave than the potential issues,
and I think than anything that can come about in the agricultural
space  at  this  point  in  time.  There  are  about  a  million  and  a  half
barrels  per  day  of  biofuels  produced  in  the  world,  and  there  is
about two and a half million barrels a day of crude oil spare capac-
ity  estimated  because  the  people  who  love  us  so  dearly  produce

much of the oil in this world, and I mean that sarcastically, do not
give  us  data  on  that.  But  that  is  probably  pretty  close  to  that.  If
you  were  to  basically  eradicate  biofuel  usage  and  the  U.S.  is  a  big
producer  of  those  biofuels,  you  would  take  about  a  million  and  a
half  barrels  of  capacity  off  the  market.  Even  if  you  did  it  over  a
slow few month’s period of time.

Crude  oil,  I  don’t  know  where  it  is  going  to  trade,  but  it  is  not
going  to  trade  $66  a  barrel.  It  is  going  to  trade  north  of  100  and
quite  a  bit  north,  and  the  reason  is  is  that  commodities  are  priced
on  the  margin,  and  when  you  take  that  kind  of,  what  may  even
seem  to  be  four  percent  or  five  percent,  it  is  just  small,  I  can  tell
you  from  experience  you  will  see  exponential  moves  in  commodity
prices such as crude oil, natural gas, et cetera.

So  the  energy  problem  is  very  dire,  and  what  we  are  rep-
resenting here today is, it is not the silver bullet. It is not the end
all,  be  all.  It  certainly  has  problems.  But  it  is  a  start,  and  it  is  an
American start to solve this problem.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well,  thank  you.  You  are  preaching  to  the  choir
with  this  one.  Don’t  think  for  a  minute  I  am  sitting  here  trying  to
defend the fossil fuel abusers of the world. Believe me. But I want
to  do  it  right.  I  mean,  we  have  a  chance.  This  is  new.  We  don’t
have  to,  you  know,  shortcut  and  then  later  say,  oh,  it  is  going  to
cost 100 times more because we didn’t do it right in the first place.
That is my point.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. You are welcome. Mr. Bartlett.
Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you.  You  mentioned  our  biofuels  contribu-
tion. You need to discount that by the fossil fuel contribution to the
production  of  those  biofuels,  and  if  we  hadn’t  turned  the  corn  into
ethanol,  we  would  have  four-fifths  as  much  fossil  fuel.  So  the  real
biofuels contribution is fairly trifling.

You  are  exactly  right  that  we  are  on  the  verge  of  not  having
enough  oil.  One  of  you  mentioned  that  the  Energy  Information
Agency  is  suggesting  crude  oil  prices  will  drop  to  $40  a  barrel.  I
think you are far, far more likely to see $100 a barrel oil than you
are $40 a barrel oil.

I  would  take  the  prognostications  of  the  Energy  Information
Agency with a lot of caution. They are basing their prognostications
on  a  series  of  computer  simulations  that  USGS  has  run.  They  did
these  in  about  2000.  They  have  been  tracking  since  then,  and  the
actual  data  points  don’t  begin  to  follow  what  they  said  was  the
main, there is a very strange transition from F, which is frequency
in  the  USGS  slides,  to  P,  which  I  guess  is  probability.  I  have  no
idea  what  has  happened  in  those  two  agencies.  And  I  have  talked
with the chief statistician from the Congressional Research Service
because  I  thought  I  was  losing  my  mind,  and  he  assured  me  that
I  wasn’t,  but  there  is  just  another  rational  explanation  of  the  way
statistics are used or misused by these two agencies. So I would be
very  jaundiced  as  to  how  much  reliance  I  placed  on,  by  the  way,
EIA does a really credible job of tracking what has happened. They
have  a  bunch  of  economists  who  do  a  very  poor  job  of  predicting,
in my view, what will happen.

And,  you  know,  they  are,  they  believe  like  many  of  my  col-
leagues,  I  am  a  very  conservative  Member  of  the  Congress,  but  I

try not to behave so that I might be considered an idiot. And many
of  my  colleagues  worship  the  market.  They  believe  that  it  is  both
omniscient  and  omnipotent,  that  it  will  take  care  of  everything.
Where are resources infinite? I might tend to agree with them.

I  talked  to  you  on  this  analogy,  worrying  about  the  worm  that
ate  the  silks  on  your  corn  while  ignoring  the  wolf  that  was  eating
your  cows,  and  I  need  to  explain  who  the  wolf  and  the  cows  are.
We use 21 million barrels of oil a day. All of these biofuels you are
talking,  and  I  am  a  huge  proponent  of  these  things.  I  am  the
greenest  guy  in  the  Congress  probably.  But,  you  know,  we  use  21
million barrels of oil a day, 70 percent of that in transportation. We
are  making  really  quite  insignificant  contributions  with  these
biofuels,  and  if  you  are  wildly  optimistic  about  the  productivity
from  these  are  going  to,  in  the  future,  make  trifling  contributions.
What  we  really  need  to  be  focused  on  is  a  lot  of  conservation  and
a  lot  of  efficiency.  I  wish  I  could  show  you  a  slide  that  shows  our
oil consumption up through the Carter years. Every decade we use
as  much  oil  as  had  been  used  in  all  of  previous  history.  Boy,  have
we  changed  that  since  then.  Have  that  exponential  occurred  when
extrapolated,  we  would  be  through  the—what  that  means,  of
course, is that when you are half out, when you have used half the
world’s oil, you have ten years remaining at the current use rates.
Now,  we  were  about  halfway  through  the  age  of  oil.  We  have
been  150  years  in  the  age  of  oil.  We  got  about  another  150  years
to  go.  We  are  not  running  out.  We  are  running  out  of  our  ability
to get oil as quickly as we would like it, and it is going to be more
expensive and harder to get in the future.

When I said we were nibbling at the margins, what I meant was
we  have  an  enormous  problem,  and  we  need  to  begin  with  an  ag-
gressive conservation program.

I  led  a  group  of  nine  people  to  China  over  the  Christmas  holi-
days.  I  spent  New  Year’s  Eve  in  Shanghai,  and  they  begin  their
discussion  of  energy  by  talking  about  post-oil.  Wow.  I  wish  our
guys  got  it.  They  are  talking  about  post-oil  with  a  great  five-point
program. Conservation is where it begins. Diversify. Do as much of
that  at  home  as  you  can.  Be  kind  to  the  environment.  That  may
shock you. That is the number four point. They recognize they have
a problem, and the fifth one is international cooperation. I don’t see
us reaching out.

I  want  to  thank  you  all  very  much  for  what  you  are  doing,  but
I  think  we  need  a  huge  wake-up  call  in  America,  and  if  you  are
counting  on  $40  oil,  you  are  probably  counting  on  winning  the  lot-
tery to solve your personal economic problems. I think the odds are
about the same.

Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Wow.  Thank  you,  Roscoe.  Interesting

thoughts and I have to agree with some of what you said.

I am not sure we have got time to go——
Mr. BARTLETT. Some of it? What don’t you agree with?

lis  wants  to  go  for  another  round  of  questioning,  but  would  any  of

you  or  all  of  you,  however  you  want  to  do  it,  comment  on  when,
if  we  will,  when  will  we  reach  the  point  of  not  blending  fuels,  but
actually  using  100  percent  of  a  biofuel  for  either  transportation  or
the generation of electricity?

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Well,  it  is  going  to  take  some  time.  I  mean,  we
have  a  fleet  of  vehicles  on  the  road  today  that  will  take  a  fair
amount  of  time  to  turn  over.  Ford,  General  Motors,  Chrysler  have
already  committed  to  producing  50  percent  of  their  vehicle  fleet
that they will produce as flex-fuel vehicles in 2012.

So,  I  mean,  we  have  about  17  million  vehicles  a  year  that  we
purchase, about 45 percent of those are from the domestic market.
That  suggests  about  four  and  a  half  to  five  million  in  flexible-fuel
vehicles coming on the road——

Chairman LAMPSON. It is flex-fuel. That is a blend.
Mr. DINNEEN.—by 2012.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  is  it  going  to  take  to  get  past  that?
Mr.  DINNEEN.  It  is  a  blend  of  85  percent  ethanol.  So,  I  mean,  it

is a good amount of petroleum displacement.

Mr. MCADAMS. Price.
Chairman LAMPSON. Price?
Mr. MCADAMS. Price. And the reason I say that, if you just take
the  current  economic  model,  there  are  a  number  of  technologies
that  could  make,  let  us  take  the  diesel  fuel.  That  could  make  100
percent  diesel  fuel  that  could  run  in  and  existing  engine  so  you
don’t  have  to  have  a  new  infrastructure,  go  through  the  current
pipelines.  They  could  make  that  kind  of  fuel  100  percent  renew-
able, but it wouldn’t be at today’s current price.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  was  just  curious.  Anybody  else  wanted  to
make  the  comment.  I  believe  that  has  got  to  be  one  of  our  goals
as well.

Does anyone want to—Roscoe, you want to make——
Mr.  BARTLETT.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  note  that  a  day
will  come  when  we  are  not  blending.  Geology  will  assure  that.  We
are  going  to  transition  from  fossil  fuels  to  renewables.  My  concern
is  it  is  not  going  to  be  on  our  terms  but  on  the  terms  of  geology,
and I think that is going to be a really rough ride.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  have  more  ques-
tions, and I am sure some of you do as well, so if you all will allow
us to, we will submit these questions in writing and get them over
to  you,  and  if  you  wouldn’t  mind  getting  back  to  us,  we  would  ap-
preciate it.

I want to thank all of you for appearing before our subcommittee
this afternoon. Your testimony has been very helpful. I believe that
the legislation we have discussed today moves us forward in our ef-
fort to develop a more diverse supply of energy.

And  under  the  rules  of  the  Committee  the  record  will  be  held
open  for  two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit  additional  statements
and  any  questions,  additional  questions  that  they  might  have  for
the  witnesses,  and  this  hearing  is  now  adjourned.  Thank  you  very
much.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Thomas  D.  Foust,  Biomass  Technology  Manager,  National  Renewable

Energy Laboratory

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. You  mentioned  that  the  technology  for  the  development  of  cellulosic  ethanol  is
‘‘relatively  immature.’’  You  went  on  to  say  that  the  goal  for  the  production  cost
price  point  on  a  gallon  of  cellulosic  ethanol  is  $1.31.  If  the  price  of  corn  con-
tinues to rise, how will this affect this target price point? And more importantly,
what are the major technological barriers to realizing a cellulosic based fuel that
is competitive with corn-based ethanol?

A1. The $1.31 production cost price point on a gallon of ethanol is based on competi-
tiveness with corn ethanol at historical corn prices of $2.50/bushel. Since corn costs
represent almost 50 percent of the total costs for corn ethanol production, corn eth-
anol production costs will increase significantly with the rising costs of corn. Equal-
ly,  if  not  more  important  for  long-term  economic  viability  of  ethanol  as  a  transpor-
tation fuel, the $1.31/gal production cost price point is also based on competitiveness
with  gasoline  on  an  energy  adjusted  basis  at  a  crude  oil  price  of  $55/barrel.  There-
fore,  both  corn  prices  and  crude  oil  prices  will  directly  affect  the  economic  viability
of  cellulosic  ethanol  at  the  production  price  point  of  $1.31/gal.  As  corn  prices  and/
or  crude  oil  prices  increase  above  historical  levels,  the  competitiveness  of  cellulosic
ethanol will increase and accelerate its deployment in the marketplace.

The  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL),  DOE,  and  the  biofuels  re-
search community at large have had numerous discussions about whether we should
periodically adjust our cellulosic ethanol price point targets based on current market
realities. The collective decision was to update on an annual basis the $1.31/gal pro-
duction cost price point target to reflect the latest inputs such as cost of steel, feed-
stock  costs,  and  labor  costs.  NREL  has  spent  considerable  effort  in  developing  rig-
orous  technical  and  economic  models  that  allow  us  to  directly  relate  technical  and
scientific targets to production cost targets. This allows us to give our scientists and
engineers  technical  targets  to  achieve  and  allows  us  to  track  and  report  progress
and research spending towards the targets accurately to DOE.
Q2. There seems to be universal recognition that the current distribution system and
infrastructure for biofuels is inadequate to handle large volumes of fuel. Noting
that  you  mentioned  two  options—either  using  the  existing  petroleum  infrastruc-
ture  or  developing  an  alternative  infrastructure—I  wanted  to  focus  on  the  exist-
ing  infrastructure.  What  research  is  still  needed  to  determine  if  this  is  a  viable
option?  What  changes,  modifications,  treatments  or  even  cleansing  would  be
needed  to  use  this  infrastructure  to  carry  biofuels?  Do  you  believe  it  would  be
possible to use some of the pipelines for multiple uses, carrying both biofuels and
petroleum based products at different times?

A2. Distribution of fuels is accomplished by several methods, including barge, tank-
er truck, rail, and especially pipeline. Infrastructure refers to the larger set of equip-
ment  and  processes,  including  storage  capacity  necessary  to  utilize  the  fuel,  tanks,
pumps at filling stations, etc.

Research  is  needed  to  determine  if  utilization  of  the  existing  distribution  system
is  a  viable  option.  The  issues  of  concern  for  ethanol  in  pipelines  are  1)  corrosion,
2)  water  miscibility  and  phase  separation,  and  3)  solvency  of  ethanol.  Ethanol-re-
lated  corrosion  problems  can  result  from  the  particular  attributes  of  the  fuel  and
how  it  behaves  in  pipelines.  There  is  evidence  that  ethanol  in  high  concentrations
can  lead  to  various  forms  of  corrosion  including  internal  stress  corrosion  cracking
that  is  difficult  to  detect.  Fuels  in  pipelines  tends  to  pick  up  water  along  the  way,
and  ethanol  accentuates  that  problem  because  it  is  hydrophilic  and  low-concentra-
tion ethanol blends have a tendency to phase separate with gasoline in the presence
of a small amount of water. Because ethanol acts as a solvent, it will tend to clean
out  the  existing  pipelines  of  tars,  gums,  and  other  impurities  that  can  degrade  the
quality  of  the  fuel  product.  Although  some  research  is  currently  being  conducted  to
find solutions to these issues and to help determine what changes need to take place
in  order  to  leverage  the  existing  systems,  it  is  minimally  supported.  To  truly  ad-
dress this important issue critically important to the ultimate success of the biofuels
industry,  a  comprehensive  research  and  testing  program  to  address  these  issues
need  to  be  initiated.  This  research  program  needs  to  involve  pipeline  owners  and
current users to ensure that rigorous testing programs are put into place to address
these issues so that this area moves forward. We understand that in Brazil ethanol

is  shipped  via  pipelines  and  we  need  to  better  understand  how  the  technical  issues
have been resolved there.
Q3. Addressing  issues  related  to  readily  available  information  on  biofuels  tech-
nologies, you noted that the Department plans to fund the creation of a Biomass
Data Center later this fiscal year. I have several questions related to this effort:
Q3a. When  was  the  announcement  made  that  the  Department  would  pursue  this  ef-

fort?

A3a. An  announcement  has  not  yet  been  made  because  the  Biomass  Data  Center
(BDC)  concept  was  just  recently  developed.  DOE  decided  to  initiate  and  fund  the
BDC following a February 2007 visit to NREL, during which we reviewed the exist-
ing information on the use of biofuels already contained in DOE’s Alternative Fuels
Data Center (AFDC) (www.eere.energy.gov/afdc), which is produced and maintained
by  NREL.  The  AFDC  is  one  of  the  most  extensive  alternative  fuel  databases  and
a  widely-used  website  by  stakeholders  across  the  country.  It  currently  contains  ex-
tensive  information  on  fuel  availability,  retailing,  nationwide  station  locations,  fed-
eral  and  State  incentives  and  laws,  and  available  vehicles  with  information  from
across government and industry. The new BDC is envisioned as an extension of the
AFDC  that  will  capture  similar  information  related  to  feedstocks,  fuel  production,
distribution infrastructure, and relevant federal and State programs. The focus will
be on supporting the decisions within the private sector and State and local govern-
ments that are required to accelerate the production and use of biofuels in the near-
term. The R&D-related data sets which are proposed in Section 2 of the Committee’s
bill  would  be  of  significant  value  to  the  BDC  and  could  readily  be  included  in  the
current planning.
Q3b. You  stated  this  would  be  done  in  phases.  Can  you  give  us  more  detail  about
time period for development of the Center and when the information will begin
to be available?

A3b. We expect the site to be available with links to existing information in the fall
of  2007.  Initial  activities  will  focus  on  a  comprehensive  inventory  of  available  data
and  information  from  government  and  industry  sources,  and  providing  a  central
clearinghouse  for  these  resources.  Gaps  identified  during  the  inventory  will  be  the
focus of the next stage over the remainder of FY08 with targeted data-gathering ac-
tivities where appropriate. Maintenance and updating of the data, along with devel-
opment  of  data  mining  and  analytical  tools,  will  be  the  focus  of  subsequent  years.
Q3c. What will be the process of getting information from the private sector?
A3c. Existing methods of working with industry representatives and associations for
the AFDC will be replicated and expanded. NREL has a long and successful history
in  forming  and  capitalizing  on  these  interfaces.  The  focus  will  be  on  publicly  avail-
able data and information, and information provided voluntarily by the private sec-
tor.  We  put  significant  effort  into  gathering  accurate  information  and  updating  it
regularly.  We  verify  data  independently  so  that  the  data  center  contains  unbiased,
factual information that can provide the basis for sound decisions by individuals and
businesses in the private sector. The biofuels R&D information that the Committee
proposes  could  readily  be  included  because  NREL  is  the  home  of  the  National  Bio-
energy  Center  and  the  focal  point  for  significant  biofuels  R&D;  knowledge  of  other
laboratory, industry, and academia progress; and technology transfer to the market-
place.

still  needs  to  be  done  to  advance  the  overall  technology  available  to  the  Nation  in

Q2. In talking about infrastructure, you say that ‘‘the current biofuel distribution in-
frastructure  is  inadequate  to  handle  large  volumes  of  biofuels.’’  Please  explain
the inadequacies.

A2. Ethanol  is  currently  distributed  by  rail,  tanker  truck,  and  barge.  Several  stud-
ies have shown the inadequacies of the existing distribution system to handle larger
volumes of biofuels. For example, at issue with barge transportation is inter-coastal
waterways traffic. Locks along the major rivers are advanced in age and undersized
for  even  current  transportation  load.  This  already  causes  long  delays  during  peak
months.

Regarding rail transport, equipment capacity has been tight for several years, and
additional rail cars and rail lines are necessary to handle the increased biofuels pro-
duction.  Tanker  trucks  for  gasoline  and  diesel  are  only  typically  used  for  short  leg
distribution,  typically  from  pipeline  terminal  to  local  refueling  station.  For  ethanol
tanker  trucks  are  commonly  used  for  longer  leg  distributions.  Although  the  addi-
tional truck traffic on highways is not necessarily problematic for the current ∼5 bil-
lion gallons per year of ethanol shipped, the additional tanker truck traffic for large
ethanol volumes (> 20 billion gallons per year) would put significantly higher truck
traffic on highways.

Additionally, pipelines are a much more energy efficient and cost effective way to
ship  fuels  so  hence  significantly  less  energy  is  used  and  cost  added  in  transport  as
opposed to the current ethanol method of barge, rail and truck.
Q3. You  mention  the  NREL  is  creating  an  on-line  Biomass  Data  Center.  Based  on
this and the function of the Data Center, do you feel that Sec. 2 of the discussion
draft,  ‘‘Biofuels  and  Biorefinery  Information  Center,’’  is  needed?  Do  you  have
any other thoughts or suggestions about the discussion draft?

A3. The  Biofuels  and  Biorefinery  Information  Center  section  is  still  needed.  This
section puts a focus on the inclusion of biofuels R&D and technology transfer infor-
mation  into  the  center,  which  is  an  important  and  value-added  concept.  This  needs
to  be  fully  integrated  with  the  Biomass  Data  Center  (BDC)  that  we  discussed,  al-
though  the  exact  architecture  is  still  being  planned.  In  addition,  this  section  of  the

69

bill  would  ensure  that  the  Congressional  appropriators  recognize  the  importance  of
this provision and provide funding to enable its full development and maintenance.
The  Biofuels  and  Biorefinery  Information  Center  will  allow  DOE  and  NREL  to
present  accurate  and  up-to-date  information  about  the  status  of  various  biorefinery
and  biofuels  production  technologies.  Providing  credible,  unbiased  information  on
these technologies will enable informed analysis by technology companies as well as
energy  and  environmental  policy-makers.  The  focus  of  the  BDC  and  the  Biofuels
and  Biorefinery  Information  Center  will  be  complementary,  and  together  will  pro-
vide reliable information about the present and future biofuels industry.

In addition, the toll-free telephone assistance included in the bill will complement
the  on-line  resources.  NREL  has  extensive  experience  providing  this  sort  of  assist-
ance. We operated the National Alternative Fuels Hotline for a decade with consist-
ently outstanding customer feedback. For the last two years, this service has taken
a  more  narrow  focus  as  the  Technical  Response  Service,  which  fields  the  more  de-
tailed  technical  questions  on  alternative  fuels  and  advanced  vehicles  that  enter
through the central DOE/EERE Information Center. With additional funding associ-
ated  with  the  Biofuels  and  Biorefinery  Information  Center,  this  existing  Technical
Response  Service  could  be  extended  to  biofuels  and  biorefinery  topics.  Past  experi-
ence  has  shown  that  this  sort  of  personal  assistance  can  be  extremely  valuable  to
key stakeholders and technology implementers in the private sector.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Section 3 of the draft legislation seems to limit infrastructure research, develop-
ment,  and  demonstration  to  existing  fuel  distribution  infrastructure.  Since
biofuels will vary by region, should we also be promoting research, development
and demonstration in alternative infrastructure solutions that could prove to be
cheaper and more efficient?

A1. Yes, biofuels production will be regionally specific primarily due to the regional
nature of biomass and local fuel needs. For example due to the large feedstock pro-
duction potential of the Midwest, it is likely that this region could be a net ethanol
exporter  beyond  what  could  be  used  locally.  Whereas  for  the  east  and  west  coasts
it  is  unlikely  that  they  would  have  enough  biomass  production  potential  to  supply
their high fuel demand needs. Hence dedicated pipelines or rail lines from the Mid-
west to the coasts might prove to be a feasible cost effective approach.

This would contrast to areas such as the Southeast where the biomass production
potential aligns well with fuel demand needs. Hence in this case more localized dis-
tribution infrastructures might be a better option.
Q2. Does  this  draft  legislation  encourage  a  departure  from  food  related  feedstocks

and toward high-yielding non-food related feedstocks?

A2. Yes  this  legislation  by  supporting  the  rapid  and  focused  development  of  cel-
lulosic  ethanol  that  is  price  competitive  with  corn  ethanol  does  support  departure
from  food  related  feedstocks  towards  high-yielding  non-food  related  feedstocks.  The
market  will  naturally  favor  the  lower  cost  production  route  and  currently  that  is
corn  ethanol.  Unfortunately  corn  ethanol  is  inherently  limited  in  potential  with
most experts estimating that the ultimate potential for corn ethanol being 12–15 bil-
lion gallons before serious impacts on other uses of corn for food and feed occur. Cel-
lulosic  ethanol  and  other  biomass  derived  fuels  can  leapfrog  this  limitation  by  sig-
nificantly increasing the ultimate potential by utilizing the much more plentiful bio-
mass  feedstock.  Cellulosic  ethanol  technology  has  the  long-term  potential  to  be  sig-
nificantly lower in cost than corn ethanol because it can utilize the much lower cost
biomass than corn for its feedstock.

However,  because  of  its  immature  state  it  is  currently  higher  cost  than  corn  eth-
anol and not proven at the commercial scale. This legislation, by supporting ongoing
DOE  supported  research  at  NREL  and  other  institutions  to  develop  and  dem-
onstrate  cost  competitive  cellulosic  ethanol  by  2012  will  facilitate  the  market  place
switch  form  corn  to  cellulosic  ethanol.  This  transition  will  stop  if  not  greatly  slow
the growth of corn based ethanol and reduce the upward pressure on corn and food
prices  while  still  affording  our  nation  the  opportunity  to  increase  our  energy  secu-
rity via domestic production of ethanol.

Q1. On  Tuesday,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA)  and  the  U.S.  Depart-

energy and related processes. They will fund essential research that not only will
lead to the creation of new, sustainable energy sources, but also will create new
uses  and  markets  for  agricultural  products.  Clearly  money  is  being  allocated  to
look  at  R&D  of  biomass.  What  will  this  legislation  accomplish  from  an  R&D
prospective that is not already being done?

A1. The  combined  USDA  and  DOE  program  for  the  research  and  development  of
biomass-based  products,  biofuels,  bioenergy  and  related  processes  has  been  a  very
successful  program  since  its  inception  in  FY02.  Many  good  projects  over  the  years
have  been  awarded  to  universities,  national  laboratories  and  industrial  companies
that  have  addressed  many  aspects  of  biofuels  and  bioproducts  technology  develop-
ment. With the many significant challenges that still face the biofuels and bioprod-
ucts  industry,  this  funding  can  be  wisely  administered  by  the  USDA  and  DOE  to
fund  meritorious  projects  to  develop  needed  technology  and  to  address  important
issues as well as educate scientists and engineers in the biomass area.

Although this is a good cross agency program, it is by no means adequate by itself
to  address  the  daunting  challenges  that  face  the  biofuels  industry.  The  projects
awarded  by  this  program  tend  to  be  small  and  limited  in  duration  to  three  years.
Hence, these projects tend to address very specific regional challenges or small indi-
vidual aspects of the feedstock or environmental issue. These projects are also good
at  building  local  support  and  interest  in  biofuels  but  do  not  address  national  bio-
mass issues.

The  legislation  in  this  bill  expands  upon  this  existing  individual  project  effort  by
supporting  comprehensive  research  and  analysis  in  many  areas  critical  to  the  ulti-
mate  success  of  biofuels.  For  example  this  legislation  will  accomplish  the  following
key aspects that need support: facilitate a critical investigation of the infrastructure
issues associated with large-scale deployment of biofuels; support core research pro-
grams at NREL, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Argonne National Labora-
tory (ANL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Idaho National Lab-
oratory  (INL),  industry,  and  universities  to  develop  all  aspects  of  cellulosic  ethanol
technology from feedstocks through biochemical and thermochemical conversion; and
allow comprehensive analysis of critical biofuels issues such as sustainability, green-
house  gas  emissions,  water  use  impacts  and  food  price  impacts.  Additionally  this
legislation  will  stimulate  the  development  of  a  much  needed  biofuels  information
clearing  house  that  will  be  invaluable  in  delivering  the  latest  accurate  information
on biofuels technology and other critical issues.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  John  Berger,  President  and  CEO,  Standard  Renewable  Energy;  CEO

of BioSelect

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. In  your  testimony,  you  noted  that  there  is  ‘‘A  great  deal  of  ambiguity. . .in  the
renewable fuel marketplace’’ because ‘‘there is very little concrete factual data as-
signed  to  specific  individual  fuels.’’  Do  you  have  a  solution  to  this  problem?  Is
there a need for better coordination of information and materials about the fuels
and the process for developing fuels? Would a central federal clearinghouse help
remedy this problem?

A1. The EPA is currently working closely with the National Biodiesel Board as well
as many government agencies such as the Department of Energy’s National Renew-
able  Energy  Lab,  to  create  a  complete  emissions  profile  for  biodiesel.  As  leaders  in
the renewable energy sector however, we ask that the Federal Government do more
with  the  creation  of  a  centralized  database  benchmarking  all  renewable  fuels  inde-
pendently to a baseline conventional diesel fuel. We as an industry will benefit tre-
mendously  from  factual  data  outlining  what  is  biodiesel  and  why  is  it  superior  to
conventional  diesel?  In  addition,  we  would  like  to  see  information  explaining  what
is  renewable  diesel  and  how  does  it  compare  to  biodiesel  and  separately  how  does
it  compare  to  conventional  diesel?  These  are  the  types  of  questions  that  need  to  be
researched.

Federal  coordination  and  cataloging  of  information  from  federal  research  on
biofuels  development  processes  as  well  as  other  aspects  of  the  industry  and  related
industries  will  be  essential  to  the  longer-term  goal  of  creating  mainstream  renew-
able fuel. Demystifying the fuels themselves will not only provide the general public
with  more  information  and  confidence  about  utilizing  renewables  but  also  assist
both  federal  and  State  bodies  in  defining  credit  structures,  future  industry  incen-
tives, etc.
Q2. You  mentioned  the  need  for  federal  coordination  of  information  and  cataloging
of  research  as  essential  to  the  long-term  goal  of  creating  mainstream  biofuels.
Without  such  efforts,  do  you  envision  a  climate  where  the  industry  can  consist-
ently grow and develop a fungible biofuel supply?

A2. In  order  for  the  industry  to  grow  and  develop,  the  marketplace  will  need  to
focus  and  work  together  towards  creating  a  fungible  and  quality  biodiesel  supply.
In  addition,  federal  coordination  is  key  in  order  to  foster  such  an  effort,  create
standards,  assist  with  phase  by  phase  implementation,  and  lastly  to  support  with
necessary  funding.  Specifically,  Standard  would  like  to  see  a  number  of  infrastruc-
ture activities pursued on a federal level, most likely through coordinated work from
government  agencies  such  as  Department  of  Energy,  the  Department  of  Transpor-
tation  and  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency.  Our  primary  focus  at  this  time  is
the continued research and development of low blend biodiesel pipeline batch move-
ments.  Successful  pipeline  analysis  testing  has  already  been  done,  on  several  dif-
ferent pipelines, on several different occasions, yet we as an industry have been re-
moved  from  the  progress.  BioSelect  is  eager  to  assist  with  this  exciting  project  and
offer  assistance  to  your  committee  and/or  all  government  agencies  interested  in
working on moving the testing forward. Additional specific research needs currently
facing  the  industry  include  but  are  not  limited  to;  feasibility  studies  on  tankage,
pipe  and  pump  options,  cold  flow  properties,  water  issues,  stability  testing  of  fuel
samples  and  advanced  vehicle  technologies.  In  addition,  we  believe  there  is  a  clear
need for an overall general economic study of capital requirements to bring biodiesel
to local retail pumps nationwide.
Q3. In  your  testimony,  you  mentioned  that  one  of  the  barriers  to  realizing  biofuels
from diverse feedstocks was laboratory and equipment availability. I was hoping
that you would clarify a bit. Is the problem better collaboration among corporate
entities with research capability, better access to federal research facilities, better
access to university research facilities, or the need for a better understanding of
where research is taking place and on what specific subject matters?

A3. The  issues  you  have  outlined  are  all  contributors  to  the  research  and  develop-
ment  of  the  biofuel  industry.  There  are  very  few  private  laboratories  available  that
are deemed acceptable by both federal and State environmental agencies which have
already caused our industry a great deal of backlogging for new testing. Universities

nationwide  have  extensive  capability  but  are  either  understaffed  or  under  funded,
which causes research and development with great promise to be defeated.
Q4. Currently, what are your fuel transport plans? What is the cost of transport and
how does it impact the price of your products? Is this the most efficient and eco-
nomical  way  to  transport  your  fuel?  If  there  is  a  significant  increase  the  in  the
use  of  biofuels,  what  will  be  the  impact  on  the  cost  of  transporting  the  fuel  if
we continue to use the same mode of transport we are currently using? Is it im-
portant  that  we  find  other  ways,  including  the  use  of  pipelines,  to  transport
biofuels?

A4. Given  the  reality  of  constrained  railroads  and  high  cost  truck  movements,  Bio-
Select  will  be  moving  the  majority  of  both  inbound  and  outbound  movements  via
barge transport. Accessibility to water is an advantage we possess over the interior
U.S.  facilities,  however  barges  and  ships  are  increasingly  in  high  demand  them-
selves and corresponding costs are also on the rise. As broad biofuels use increases,
these  already  existent  issues  will  escalate.  Finding  other  modes  of  transportation,
i.e.,  national  pipelines,  is  imperative  in  order  for  biofuels  to  become  mainstream
fuel.
Q5. You  mentioned  that  standardization  of  all  biofuels  is  imperative  to  ensure
fungibility. If we do not have clear standards that provide for homogeneous fuel
that is fungible, what do you believe will be the impact on our long-term biofuel
supply?

A5. Without  clear  standards  the  result  would  be  off-spec,  low  quality  fuel  entering
the  marketplace.  Bad  fuel  could  cause  damage  to  engines  in  all  sectors  and  would
seriously hinder customer confidence.
Q6. You  briefly  mention  that  as  the  biodiesel  industry  develops,  the  demand  for
highly  skilled  trained  labor  will  rise.  Are  you  already  finding  that  there  is  a
shortage  of  trained  skilled  workers  to  meet  your  needs?  And,  do  we  need  a  spe-
cialized workforce training program geared to biofuels production?

A6. Education is key. Training and instruction focused on biofuels must find its way
into academic curriculum for America’s youth nationwide. Offering a tailored chem-
ical  engineering  skill  set  to  young  potential  operators  would  help  create  a  special-
ized  workforce  and  make  the  transition  into  biofuels  a  streamlined  process  univer-
sally.

Responses by Robert Dinneen, President and CEO, Renewable Fuels Association

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. Clearly, there is agreement from many stakeholders that there is a need for bet-
ter  coordination  and  centralization  of  biofuels  research  materials.  In  your  testi-
mony,  you  noted  that  it  would  be  more  appropriate  for  industry  to  serve  as  a
clearinghouse  of  this  information  than  the  Federal  Government.  And  though  I
understand  the  value  in  having  industry  very  involved  in  this  process,  with  so
much research going on with the Federal Government, it seems only logical that
the  government  would  coordinate  a  centralize  systems  for  organizing  all  these
materials.  And,  a  reasonable  use  of  federal  funds.  So,  would  an  industry  advi-
sory  group  be  a  good  part  of  an  information  center  to  ensure  strong  industry
participation?

A1. An  industry  advisory  group  to  assist  in  the  coordination  of  research  activities
is  a  good  idea  and  would  certainly  help  to  ensure  there  is  as  little  redundancy  in
research and development efforts of both the public and private sectors as possible.
Q2. As  you  noted  in  your  testimony,  the  discussion  draft  creates  a  new  Biorefinery
Energy  Efficiency  program.  With  significant  resources  already  being  dedicated
to  general  research,  we  thought  it  appropriate  to  enhance  the  existing  programs
with  some  more  focused  mission  specific  efforts.  With  that  in  mind,  are  there
other focused research areas that the Committee should consider as we move to-
ward consideration of the bill?

A2. As  I  stated  in  my  testimony,  advances  in  research  on  the  development  of  proc-
esses  to  produce  alternative  energy  at  biorefineries  such  as  biomass  co-generation
and  biomass  gasification,  and  methane  production  through  anaerobic  digestors  and
waste  gasifiers,  will  be  critical  to  increase  energy  efficiency  and  reduce  the  energy
consumption  of  biorefineries.  Encouraging  alternative  energy  sources  is  an  impor-
tant step toward enacting policies for a more diverse, domestic energy resource port-
folio.  Other  areas  where  additional  research  could  prove  quite  helpful  would  be  in
co-products, enhancing the feed value of distiller’s dried grains and identifying new
uses  for  the  proteins,  minerals  and  oils  that  remain  after  the  starch  is  converted
into  fuel  at  ethanol  plants.  Finally,  research  into  future  market  opportunities  for
ethanol, such as fuel cells, will be important to continued growth.

Questions submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. I  am  curious  about  a  statement  in  your  testimony.  You  state,  ‘‘And  there  is  not
an  ethanol  company  represented  by  RFA  that  does  not  have  a  cellulose  to  eth-
anol research program.’’ Are these research programs supported with federal dol-
lars? Are these research programs done independently by the companies? If every
ethanol  company  you  represent  has  a  program  how  many  programs  are  there?
If  every  ethanol  company  you  represent  has  a  program,  whether  it  be  privately
or publicly funded, do we need more?

A1. It is certainly true that virtually every ethanol company in the country is look-
ing  into  the  possibilities  of  producing  ethanol  from  cellulosic  feedstocks.  First,  all
of  these  plants  already  have  cellulosic  feedstocks  coming  into  the  plant  in  the  form
of  corn  fiber.  But,  more  importantly,  every  company  recognizes  that  the  future  of
ethanol  lies  in  the  ability  to  convert  non-grain  feedstocks  into  fuel.  Certainly,  some
of  these  research  efforts  have  received  government  support.  Recently,  the  U.S.  De-
partment of Energy awarded six grants totaling $385 million to six different compa-
nies  spread  across  the  country  and  using  a  variety  of  feedstocks  and  technologies.
Federal  efforts  such  as  this  are  invaluable  to  moving  the  commercialization  of  cel-
lulosic  ethanol  technology  further  as  quickly  as  possible.  Other  research  is  clearly
occurring  without  Federal  Government  support,  and  is  supported  by  state  grants,
foundations,  academic  institutions  or  private  funds.  It  all  will  help.  We  ought  not
limit any of these important efforts.
Q2. It  is  my  understanding  that,  as  you  mention  in  your  testimony  one  of  the  chal-
lenges  of  using  more  ethanol  is  a  lack  of  storage  capacity.  Is  the  same  true  if
we  are  to  use  cellulosic  ethanol  as  a  feedstock?  If  the  cellulosic  ethanol  is  not
transportable via pipeline, what storage challenges do you foresee? Is it tankage?
What  are  the  challenges  to  collection,  storage,  and  handling  of  feedstocks  other
than corn ethanol?

A2. Actually,  I  do  not  believe  storage  capacity  will  be  a  major  barrier  to  expanded
ethanol production and use. I believe the market will respond with expanded infra-
structure  as  needed,  including  potentially  shipping  ethanol  via  pipeline  if  the  mar-
ketplace  demand  supports  it.  There  will  be  new  challenges  as  ethanol  is  produced
from new feedstocks, however; none are insurmountable. Because there will be new
feedstocks  needed  for  many  of  these  new  cellulosic  ethanol  facilities,  growers  will
need  an  opportunity  to  experiment  with  what  will  likely  be  new  crops  for  many  of
them.  Programs  to  familiarize  growers  with  all  aspects  of  new  cellulosic  crops  will
be  essential.  These  programs  should  include  research  and  development,  manage-
ment,  harvest,  transport,  and  storage  techniques,  and  collection  of  data  relevant  to
new  cellulosic  feedstocks.  Such  programs  will  allow  growers  to  experiment  with
other crops, and incentivize farmers to plant cellulose crops, and continue U.S. agri-
culture’s investment in our domestic biofuels industry.
Q3. Mr.  Dinneen,  you  mention  in  your  testimony  that  the  ethanol  industry  has
worked to expand a virtual pipeline. That virtual pipeline consists of rail, barge
and  truck  traffic.  Are  you  saying  the  ethanol  industry  does  not  believe  there  is
a  need  to  study  the  impact  of  ethanol  on  pipeline  infrastructure?  Are  you  not
supportive  of  research  and  development  that  would  enable  ethanol,  or  for  that
matter  the  finished  motor  fuel  containing  ethanol,  to  be  shipped  via  pipeline?
Q3. As I stated in my testimony, the ethanol industry has worked to expand a ‘‘Vir-
tual Pipeline’’ through aggressive use of the rail system, barge and truck traffic.
As a result, we can move product quickly to those areas where it is needed. Many
ethanol  plants  have  the  capability  to  load  unit  trains  of  ethanol  for  shipment
to ethanol terminals in key markets. Unit trains are quickly becoming the norm,
not the exception, which was not the case just a few years ago. Railroad compa-
nies  are  working  with  our  industry  to  develop  infrastructure  to  meet  future  de-
mand  for  ethanol.  We  are  also  working  closely  with  terminal  operators  and  re-
finers  to  identify  ethanol  storage  facilities  and  install  blending  equipment.  We
will continue to grow the necessary infrastructure to make sure that in any mar-
ket  we  need  to  ship  ethanol  there  is  rail  access  at  gasoline  terminals,  and  that
those terminals are able to take unit trains.

That said, many stakeholders in the biofuels industry are beginning to look at the
practical  issues  involved  with  shipping  ethanol  via  a  dedicated  pipeline.  Shipping
ethanol  in  pipelines  is  done  today  in  Brazil,  and  it  has  been  done  at  times  in  the
U.S.,  as  well,  in  dedicated  pipelines.  If  the  marketplace  demands  it,  as  it  does  in
Brazil, and there is enough ethanol demand to warrant the investment in the infra-
structure  for  dedicated  pipelines,  such  a  system  will  develop  in  the  U.S.  Studying
the feasibility of transporting ethanol by pipeline from the Midwest to the East and
West coasts will be very helpful.

Questions submitted by Representative Bob Inglis
Q1. Section 3 of the draft legislation seems to limit infrastructure research, develop-
ment  and  demonstration  to  existing  fuel  distribution  infrastructure.  Since
biofuels will vary by region, should we also be promoting research, development,
and demonstration in alternative infrastructure solutions that could prove to be
cheaper and more efficient?

A1. In  my  testimony,  I  noted  that  programs  that  promote  geographical  dispersion
will help to commercialize cellulosic ethanol quickly and continue the trend just be-
ginning to expand ethanol production beyond the traditional corn belt. A wide vari-
ety  of  energy  crops  and  agricultural  waste  products  such  as  switchgrass,
myscanthis,  wood  chips  and  corn  stover  from  many  regions  of  the  country  must  all
be researched, developed and commercialized as additional ethanol feedstocks to re-
alize the annual production levels envisioned by Congress.
Q2. Does  this  draft  legislation  encourage  a  departure  from  food  related  feedstocks

and toward high-yielding non-food related feedstocks?

A2. To  date,  the  U.S.  ethanol  industry  has  grown  almost  exclusively  from  grain
processing.  As  a  result  of  steadily  increasing  yields  and  improving  technology,  the
National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) projects that by 2015, corn growers will
produce 15 billion bushels of grain. According to the NCGA analysis, this will allow
a  portion  of  that  crop  to  be  processed  into  15  billion  gallons  of  ethanol  without  sig-
nificantly disrupting other markets for corn. Ethanol also represents a growing mar-
ket for other grains, such as grain sorghum. Ethanol production consumed approxi-
mately  26  percent  of  the  Nation’s  sorghum  crop  in  2006  (domestic  use).  Research
is  also  underway  on  the  use  of  sweet  and  forage  sorghum  for  ethanol  production.

In  fact,  the  National  Sorghum  Producers  believe  that  as  new  generation  ethanol
processes are studied and improved, sorghum’s role will continue to expand.

75

In  the  future,  however,  ethanol  will  be  produced  from  other  feedstocks,  such  as
cellulose.  Ethanol  from  cellulose  will  dramatically  expand  the  types  and  amount  of
available  material  for  ethanol  production,  and  ultimately  dramatically  expand  eth-
anol supplies. Further, biotechnology will play a significant role in meeting our na-
tion’s  future  ethanol  needs.  Average  yield  per  acre  is  not  static  and  will  increase
incrementally,  especially  with  the  introduction  of  new  biotech  hybrid  varieties.  Ac-
cording  to  NCGA,  corn  yields  have  consistently  increased  an  average  of  about  3.5
bushels  per  year  over  the  last  decade.  Based  on  the  10-year  historical  trend,  corn
yield  per  acre  could  reach  180  bushels  by  2015.  For  comparison,  the  average  yield
in  1970  was  about  72  bushels  per  acre.  Agricultural  companies  like  Monsanto  be-
lieve  we  can  achieve  corn  yields  of  up  to  300  bushels  per  acre  by  2030.  It  is  not
necessary to limit the potential of any feedstock—existing or prospective.

Ultimately,  the  marketplace  will  determine  which  feedstocks  are  the  most  eco-
nomically  and  environmentally  feasible.  While  there  are  indeed  limits  to  what  we
will  be  able  to  produce  from  grain,  cellulose  ethanol  production  will  augment,  not
replace, grain-based ethanol. The conversion of feedstocks like corn stover, corn fiber
and corn cobs will be the ‘‘bridge technology’’ that leads the industry to the conver-
sion  of  other  cellulosic  feedstocks  and  energy  crops  such  as  wheat  straw,
switchgrass,  and  fast-growing  trees.  Even  the  garbage,  or  municipal  solid  waste,
Americans throw away today will be a future source of ethanol.

To  continue  this  technological  revolution  in  cellulosic  ethanol,  the  biomass,  bio-
research, and biorefinery research and development programs included in H.R. 2773
will be essential to developing these new technologies and bringing them to commer-
cialization.
