FEDERAL  TRADE  COMMISSION 

REAUTHORIZATION 

TUESDAY,  APRIL  8,  2008 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10  a.m.  in  room  SR– 
253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  Byron  L.  Dorgan,  pre-
siding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

Senator  DORGAN.  We  will  call  the  hearing  to  order.  This  is  the 

hearing of the full Senate Commerce Committee. 

The subject today is the Federal Trade Commission Reauthoriza-

tion bill. 

The  Federal  Trade  Commission  is  a  very  important  Federal 
agency,  perhaps  more  important  now  than  ever,  and  despite  that, 
the Federal Trade Commission has been one of those agencies that 
has  shrunk  in  size,  despite  the  fact  that  it  has  a  broader  agenda 
in many ways. 

It  has  been  reduced  from  a  pre-1980  high  of  roughly  1,700  em-
ployees  to  now  1,100  employees.  Its  jurisdiction  would  have  been 
or  should  be  dealing  with  things  like  deceptive  advertising  and 
competition  and  subprime  loans.  All  of  us  understand  the  nomen-
clature  of  subprime  lending  these  days  and  what  it  has  done  to 
cause  economic  difficulties:  oil  pricing,  consumer  protection,  merg-
ers, trade. 

All  of  these  are  very,  very  important  issues  and  they  have  be-
come even more important at a time when the Federal Trade Com-
mission  has  a  third  less  people  than  it  did  25  years  ago  to  do  its 
work. 

I  want  to  put  up  a  couple  of  posters,  if  I  might,  this  morning.  I 
especially  want  to  talk  about  the  importance  of  having  a  Federal 
Trade Commission that can establish a set of rules with respect to 
deceptive  advertising,  and  I  do  this  only  because  we  have  on  the 
Floor  of  the  Senate  today  the  housing  issue  which  relates  to  the 
subprime  scandal  and  a  lot  of  reasons  and  a  lot  of  causes,  but  I 
want to describe some of them. 

This  is  an  advertisement  that  most  of  us  have  been  treated  to 
here  in  this  country.  It’s  from  a  company  called  Zoom  Credit.  I 
don’t  know  who  Zoom  Credit  is,  but  here’s  what  they  were  telling 
us in advertising. ‘‘Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the 
fast  track  at  Zoom  Credit  .
.  Even  if  your  credit  is  in  the  tank,

Zoom  Credit’s  like  money  in  the  bank.  We  specialize  in  credit  re-
pair  and  debt  consolidation.  Bankruptcies,  slow  credit,  no  credit— 
who cares?’’ That’s an advertisement to the American people. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Next  chart.  Millennium  Mortgage,  ‘‘Twelve 
months  No  Mortgage  payment.  That’s  right.  We’ll  give  you  the 
money  to  make  your  first  12  payments  if  you  call  in  the  next  7 
days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may reduce your current 
monthly payments by as much as 50 percent and allow you no pay-
ments  for  the  first  12  months.’’  That’s  an  advertisement  to  the 
American  people  by  Millennium  Mortgage.  Didn’t  mention,  of 
course,  that  the  first  12  months  goes  in  the  back  of  the  loan  and 
actually increased the price of the house.

Senator  DORGAN.  Countrywide,  the  largest  lender  in  this  coun-
try, said this in their ad. ‘‘Do you have less than perfect credit? Do 
you  have  late  mortgage  payments?  Have  you  been  denied  by  other 
lenders?  Call  us.’’  That’s  from  the  largest  mortgage  bank  in  this 
country. 

Senator DORGAN. And by the way, these are still on the Internet. 
We  got  some  yesterday:  2,500  of  a  percent  fixed  loan.  One-quarter 
of  1  percent  rate  for  a  fixed  loan;  $500,000,  half  a  million  loan, 
your payment’s going to be a $104 a month. That’s what they’re ad-
vertising.  They  don’t,  of  course,  tell  the  person  that  there’s  much, 
much more here to this story than that. 

You  want  to  get  $200,000  to  buy  a  house,  your  house  payment 
will  be  $41  a  month,  according  to  this  advertisement.  Next  one  is 
credit.com.  I’m  just  going  to  run  through  a  couple  of  them  just  to 
describe  for  a  moment  the  need  I  believe  for  expanded  rulemaking 
authority by the Federal Trade Commission.

Senator  DORGAN.  This  is  credit.com.  Low  documentation  loans 
and  no  documentation  loans  and  this  advertisement  says  that  we 
are  doing  this  to  protect  your  privacy.  You  want  to  apply  for  a 
mortgage,  you  can  do  it  either  with  no  documentation  of  your  in-
come or low documentation of your income.

Senator DORGAN. This was on the Internet yesterday, still going. 
One  year  fixed  payments  as  low  as  1  percent.  Five-year  fixed  pay-
ments  as  low  as  one  and  a  quarter  percent.  You  want  a  loan  for 
your home and pay one and a quarter percent interest rate for five 
straight  years.  That’s  what  this  company’s  advertising.  Pretty  un-
believable when you think about it. 

Senator DORGAN. They say get a loan like this and control up to 
two  to  three  times  as  much  real  estate  versus  conventional  fixed 
rate  mortgages.  Here’s  another  one  that  is  one  of  the  more  decep-
tive, it seems to me. Thirty-year fixed loan from 2.75 percent.

Does  anybody  in  this  room  think  you  can  get  a  30-year  fixed 
mortgage  at  2.75  percent  interest  rate?  Anybody  believe  that?  By 
the way, this is on the Internet advertising to American people yes-
terday. I pulled that off the Internet yesterday. 2.75 percent inter-
est rate, fixed rate, for 30 years. 

Senator  DORGAN.  All  right.  The  last  one.  This,  too,  was  on  the 
Internet  yesterday,  and  it  says  these  are  perfect—this  is  a  loan, 
perfect  credit  not  required,  no  income  verification  loans.  In  fact,  it 
says they are ideal for the self-employed.

Senator  DORGAN.  Well,  you  get  my  point.  My  point  is  there  has 
been  unbelievably  deceptive  advertising  out  there  and  it  exists 
today  while  we  sit  here  in  this  room  talking  about  consumer  pro-
tection. 

Now  I’ve  introduced  a  piece  of  legislation  with  the  Chairman  of 
this  Committee  as  a  cosponsor  and  others  to  reauthorize  the  Fed-
eral  Trade  Commission.  I  welcome  the  Commissioners  here  today. 
I want to start by particularly paying notice that we have a new 
Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Bill Kovacic. The Chairman con-
gratulates  you  for  assuming  the  chairmanship.  You’ve  been  with

the  FTC  for  many  years  but  have  just  assumed  these  new  respon-
sibilities.

The  previous  Chairman  of  the  Commission,  Chairman  Majoras, 
was  with  us  in  September  to  testify  as  we  considered  drafting  the 
FTC  Reauthorization  bill  in  2008,  and  this  morning  I  introduced 
that bill with Senator Inouye. We’re pleased to be introducing a bill 
that we believe gives the Federal Trade Commission the needed op-
portunities to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices 
and unfair methods of competition. 

I want to briefly outline what the FTC Reauthorization Act does. 
First, it provides for a 7-year reauthorization, starting in 2009. We 
set  the  funding  level  at  $264  million,  increase  it  10  percent  per 
year. We do that because, as I indicated earlier, we’re at a near 30- 
year  low.  We’re  still  almost  30  percent  below  where  we  were  two 
and a half decades ago at a time when we need much more muscle 
and  capability  in  our  Federal  agency  to  regulate  and  investigate. 
We  give  the  FTC  independent  litigating  authority  so  they  won’t 
have to refer in every case, in the cases they now do to the Depart-
ment  of  Justice.  We  give  the  FTC  authority  to  give  preference  in 
the hiring process to administrative law judges who have some ex-
perience in the issues. 

We  give  the  FTC  the  authority  to  commence  a  civil  action  to  re-
cover  civil  penalties  in  the  district  court  for  a  violation  of  the  FTC 
Act.  We  extend  the  jurisdiction  to  allow  them  to  go  after  nonprofit 
entities  as  well,  to  investigate  in  cases  where  it  is  necessary,  so 
that bad actors cannot hide behind a nonprofit status, and we allow 
them to go after those aiding and abetting an FTC violation. 

We give them the authority, by majority vote of the full Commis-
sion,  to  waive  their  current  rulemaking  requirements  for  any  rule 
involving  a  consumer  protection  matter.  We  require  the  FTC  con-
duct a rulemaking under the Administrative Procedures Act which 
is  faster  than  their  current  Magnuson-Moss  authority  in  the  area 
of subprime loans. 

I know the Commission has sent 200 warning letters to mortgage 
advertisers  and  is  conducting  several  investigations  of  mortgage 
advertisers  and  subprime  lenders.  In  addition,  they’ve  brought  21 
cases  in  the  last  decade,  but  they  have  not  had  the  opportunity  to 
review bad practices and create a rule on bad practices that would 
prevent their recurrence and that is absolutely essential. 

We also repeal the common carrier exemption which the FTC has 
long  been  requesting  and  which  I  have  been  trying  to  accomplish. 
I  want  to  thank  the  FTC  for  its  work  in  these  many  areas.  As 
you know, here in the Congress, we have just passed a Do Not Call 
Registry piece of legislation that makes that list permanent. I want 
to thank you for your support of that. We don’t want people having 
their  mealtime  interrupted  by  unwanted  solicitation  calls  and  we 
think  we  have  accomplished  that  by  permanently  extending  the 
list. 

You  had  six  settlement  cases  in  November  2007  against  compa-
nies  that  violated  that  Do  Not  Call  List.  I  congratulate  you  for 
that. 

Finally,  I  know  you’ve  hosted  a  workshop  on  behavioral  adver-
tising and you’ve released a set of proposed principles to guide the 
development  of  self-regulation  in  this  area,  and  I  believe  you’ve 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\DOCS\75166.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

been  seeking  comments  on  those  principles  and  those  comments 
are  due  April  11,  and  I’ll  be  studying  those  comments  and  looking 
at legislation in this area as well. 

I  just  want  to  make  one  final  point.  I  know  that  there  are  some 
who  may  look  at  these  set  of  recommendations  and  say,  well,  this 
is once again giving a Federal agency some more authority and it’s 
once  again  suggesting  there  should  be  some  additional  regulation. 
You  know,  I  think  it’s  very  interesting  that  the  Federal  Reserve 
Board  and  the  American  taxpayers  have  ponied  up  $30  billion  to 
assume  the  risk  of  JPMorgan  buying  BearStearns.  Why?  Because 
we’re told that BearStearns is too big to fail. If it is too big to fail, 
why  is  it  not  big  enough  to  regulate?  Why  do  we  have—this  is  a 
different question, perhaps a different committee. 

But  why,  if  we  have  institutions  that  are  too  big  to  fail,  do  we 
not have effective regulation of the kinds of things that can be very 
detrimental  to  this  country?  I  believe  that  there  are  certain  times 
and cases where someone ought to look over the shoulder of an or-
ganization  that’s  too  big  to  fail  and  take  a  look  at  what  they’re 
doing and make sure that we put them back on track. 

You,  in  the  FTC,  understand  we’ve  also  asked  a  lot  of  questions 
about the price of gasoline and I would just say this to you as you 
take  a  new  look  at  that.  I  believe  that  there’s  a  lot  happening  in 
that  area  that  bears  watching.  There’s  unbelievable  speculation  in 
the  futures  market  for  oil.  We  in  the  futures  market  buy  and  sell 
20 times more oil every day than exists. There is just an unbeliev-
able amount of speculation. Some believe that the price of gasoline 
and oil is about $20 or $30 a barrel for the price of oil above where 
it  ought  to  be  because  of  the  unbelievable  speculation  in  the  fu-
tures  market  where  you  can  operate  on  margins  of  five  and  7  per-
cent as opposed to the stock market which requires a margin of 50 
percent. 

All  of  this  doesn’t  fall  on  your  lap.  My  only  point  is  that  energy 
prices  are  a  serious  issue  for  the  American  people  and  I  think 
there’s a lot to investigate with respect to that as well. 

I’m  going  to  recognize  the  Commission  in  a  moment,  but  I  will 

call on my colleague from Minnesota for an opening statement. 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman. 
Thank  you  for  holding  this  important  hearing.  Welcome  to  the 
Commissioners, and I know that this hearing is coming at a critical 
time for the FTC with the massive consumer protection challenges 
we  are  facing  today.  We  certainly  have  seen  it  with  the  consumer 
issues with the toys in from China. 

We’ve  seen  it  in  Minnesota  with  the  problems  we’ve  seen  with 
cell  phone  service  and  advertisements  about  no  dropped  calls  and 
then  it  turns  out,  when  we  actually  had  a  hearing  on  this,  there 
was  a  big  billboard  for  one  of  the  companies  and  we  were  able  to 
take a picture of that billboard where they said one of the best net-
works with a picture of their phone where there were no bars, and 
certainly  in  the  pharmaceutical  area,  and  I’ll  talk  about  that  in  a 
minute, we’ve been seeing problems with what I consider problem-
atic trade practices.

Whether  it  be  the  subprime  lending  crisis,  the  record  oil  prices, 
the unsafe food and the products making their ways to our shelves, 
to the skyrocketing healthcare and pharmaceutical costs, American 
consumers  are  finding  themselves  under  duress  in  an  unprece-
dented  way  and  at  the  same  time,  we  are  seeing  a  reduction  from 
this Administration in the budgets for agencies. We certainly found 
that  with  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  and  it  made 
what was already a problem worse. 

If we look at the major issues the Senate has addressed in recent 
weeks,  we  see  that  consumer  protection  is  among  the  public’s 
greatest concerns. I was pleased with the work that the Senate did 
in  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  Reform  Act  and  we 
are  currently  debating  how  to  improve  Federal  regulation,  as  you 
know, in the mortgage area. 

More  and  more  Americans  are  worried  about  their  economic  fu-
ture,  about  their  ability  to  make  ends  meet,  and  they’re  outraged 
when  they  see  companies  engaging  in  deceptive  or  unreasonable 
pricing  or  sales  schemes,  and  as  we  see  a  rockier  picture  for  our 
economy,  I  can  tell  you,  based  on  my  experience  as  a  prosecutor, 
whenever  there  are  some  difficult  economic  times,  you  see  crime 
and fraudulent practices going up. People are used to a certain life-
style.  They  want  to  keep  it  that  way.  So,  they’ll  go  across  the  line 
to  be  able  to  keep  their  own  wallets  full  and  what  I’m  concerned 
about here, as we’ve already seen because of all the imports coming 
in,  more  need  for  regulation  of  deceptive  practices,  and  I  think 
we’re even going to see more going forward. 

Hardly  a  week  goes  by  that  we  don’t  get  another  report  of  a 
pharmaceutical  company  grossly  inflating  the  price  of  a  vital  drug 
or a wireless company charging customers for invented fees hidden 
in  their  monthly  bill  or  a  mortgage  lender  offering  deceptive  home 
loans to low-income families. 

The  FTC’s  role  in  protecting  against  abuses  of  consumer  trust 
and confidence has never been more important. Since the last reau-
thorization bill Congress passed in 1996, the Commission has done 
admirable work in responding to companies’ unfair or deceptive ac-
tions  and  unfair  methods  of  competition,  but  given  the  current  cli-
mate  and  conditions,  it  is  clear  that  the  FTC  must  be  granted  en-
hanced and expanded authority and resources to carry out its mis-
sion  and  I  appreciate  that  some  of  the  Commissioners  have  high-
lighted  areas  in  which  your  current  ability  to  protect  consumers  is 
unnecessarily  restricted  and  for  continuing  to  push  for  greater  au-
thority. 

I  want  to  commend  Senator  Dorgan  for  his  outstanding  work  in 
drafting the FTC Reauthorization legislation we’re discussing today 
and  I  believe  that  this  bill  makes  several  important  improvements 
to strengthen the FTC’s oversight authority. I just want to tell you 
when  you’re  done  with  your  opening  remarks,  one  area  that  I’m 
very interested in is what’s going on with the pharmaceutical com-
panies. 

This  year,  I’ve  heard  from  Children’s  Hospital  in  Minneapolis 
and  consumers  and  other  pediatric  care  providers  regarding  the 
drastic price increase of Indomethacin, which is a drug that’s used 
to  treat  children’s  heart  problems  and  it  actually  saves  a  lot  of 
money because you don’t need surgery.

Two  years  ago,  Ovation  Pharmaceuticals  acquired  the  rights  to 
this  drug  from  Merck  and  the  company  increased  the  price  within 
a year by 18 times the amount without improving the drug in any 
way. We had a meeting with a number of doctors in Minnesota and 
the head of the hospital as well as patients, parents of little babies 
who were there who had been saved by this drug, and I know that 
the FTC has engaged in investigations of this type of activity in the 
past.  One  of  my  lines  of  questioning  will  be  about  how  this  could 
take  place,  if  you  need  additional  authority  to  go  after  practices 
like  this,  and  what  the  history  is  for  these  kinds  of  investigations. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator DORGAN. Senator Klobuchar, thank you very much. 
Mr. Chairman, we will hear from you first. 

STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM E. KOVACIC, CHAIRMAN, 

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Dorgan,  Senator 

Klobuchar. 

I’m  enormously  grateful  for  the  opportunity  to  serve  as  Chair  of 
my  agency  and  to  appear  today  to  discuss  with  you  the  reauthor-
ization proposals that you’ve just described. 

I want to emphasize that the growth and success of this agency, 
if  we  take  it  over  a  span  certainly  of  its  modern  history,  has  been 
largely  attributable  to  a  very  successful  partnership  between  the 
Congress,  this  Committee,  and  the  Commission  in  getting  needed 
adjustments in its authority and resources over time. 

It  would  be  impossible  to  discuss  the  accomplishments  both  of 
you  have  alluded  to  without  touching  upon  a  number  of  instances, 
certainly  dating  back  to  1970,  in  which  this  committee  and  the 
Congress have provided needed enhancements to authority. 

So, it’s an enormous privilege for me today to continue that con-
versation and to continue that partnership that will put this agen-
cy in a position to be successful in the future. 

Let me take a moment to introduce my colleagues and to discuss 
the  distribution  of  comments  across  us.  I’ll  be  talking  a  bit  about 
resources  and  the  common  carrier  exemption.  My  colleague,  Com-
missioner  Harbour  will  be  discussing  our  recent  experience  in  en-
forcement  and  policymaking.  My 
colleague,  Commissioner 
Leibowitz  will  be  discussing  the  aiding  and  abetting  and  civil  pen-
alties  elements  of  the  reauthorization  proposal,  and  my  colleague, 
Commissioner Rosch will talk about independent litigating author-
ity and rulemaking. 

As a general observation, we welcome and encourage your efforts 
to continue to see that this agency is put on a footing that permits 
it  to  deliver  effective  competition  and  consumer  protection  pro-
grams  in  the  future.  I  can  only  say  that  without  the  partnership 
that  I  referred  to  before,  it  would  have  been  impossible  for  us  to 
achieve  the  success  that  we  have  in  many  areas  of  our  consumer 
protection and competition programs. 

The reauthorization proposal today provides a wonderful occasion 

to continue that discussion. 

I  want  to  turn  to  the  topic  of  resources  which  Chairman  Dorgan 
mentioned just a moment ago. I think that the framework that the 
Committee  has  established  is  a  very  sensible  one  from  several  di-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\DOCS\75166.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

rections. Whether or not the precise numbers come through the ap-
propriations  process  over  time,  none  of  us  can  know.  I  think  the 
basic  framework  is  a  sensible  one,  and  in  particular  I  like  the  fact 
that it takes a long-term focus. 

So  rather  than  thinking  about  how  the  Commission  and  its  re-
sources might go from year to year, it puts us in the position of be-
ginning  to  think,  in  a  very  intelligent  way  about  what  our  needs 
ought to be over the horizon. 

Indeed,  with  my  colleagues’  approval,  I’ve  suggested  internally, 
largely inspired by this approach, that we undertake our own basic 
self-assessment  of  our  capacity  of  the  position  that  we  want  to 
achieve,  not  simply  in  the  short  term,  but  when  we  reach  our  cen-
tennial,  which  is  only  6  years  away.  Essentially,  we  now  need  to 
ask  ourselves  in  a  very  careful  way  with  consultations  with  others 
where the Commission should be at 100. 

Another  thing  I  want  to  underscore  that,  I  think  is  particularly 
useful  in  this  set  of  proposals,  is  the  separate  dedication  of  what 
might be called a capital budget for information technology. 

If  you  look  at  the  numbers  Senator  Dorgan  mentioned  before, 
you’ll  find  that  the  trend  from  the  late  1970s  to  the  present  basi-
cally  has  not  affected  the  number  of  professionals  we  have.  Those 
numbers  have  shrunk  mainly  because  machines  have  replaced  ad-
ministrative  support  staff.  That  means,  though,  that  the  enhance-
ment of our IT capability remains absolutely indispensable to what 
we  do.  We  may  not  simply  preserve  its  existing  capacity;  we  must 
improve it over time. 

I think the focus in the reauthorization measure to look at infor-
mation  technology,  equipment,  and  facilities  as  being  key  ingredi-
ents  to  improving  productivity  is  a  very  sensible  way  to  go  ahead. 
Indeed,  the  only  question  I  would  have  for  you  is  that  if  the  en-
hancements  and  authority  that  have  been  suggested  take  place, 
whether  the  numbers  will  be  enough.  I’m  sure  there  will  be  occa-
sions  to  revisit  that  in  the  future.  I’d  add  again  that  with  the  en-
couragement of the Committee, if you look at the trend in our pro-
fessionals,  our  lawyers  and  economists,  going  back  basically  over 
that  20-year  period,  your  assistance  has  permitted  us,  going  back 
to  the  early  1980s,  to  at  least  keep  the  number  of  lawyers  and 
economists  at  the  same  level.  Indeed,  over  the  past  decade  we’ve 
seen modest increases to that capacity. 

I  think  that  the  proposals  with  respect  to  resources  keep  us  on 

that path. 

I  want  to  finish  by  saying  that  the  common  carrier  adjustment 
is  a  necessary  step.  This  was  set  in  place  when  this  agency  was 
created  in  1914.  The  exemption  hasn’t  changed,  but  I  think  we  all 
know that the industry has changed just a little. 

Who  could  have  imagined  in  1914  the  array  of  adjustments  in 
what  we  now  call  the  telecommunications  sector?  What  the  failure 
to  revisit  that  exemption  has  done  is  that  we  almost  every  day  of 
the  week  bump  into  limitations  in  our  capacity  to  do  exactly  the 
kind of work that both of you have referred to. Senator Klobuchar, 
in  particular,  mentioned  cellular  telephony.  That’s  an  area  that  in 
many  respects  we  can’t  touch.  We’re  like  the  old  county  policeman 
who has to drive up to the border and stop when we bump into the 
jurisdictional  hurdle  of  the  common  carrier  barrier,  and  I  think

that  this,  along  with  the  not-for-profit  proposal,  again  puts  us  in 
a  good  position  to  begin  to  rethink  what  I  believe  to  be  anachro-
nisms  in  our  statute  that  were  set  in  place  long  ago  and  severely 
need a rethink. 

I’ll  now  turn  to  my  colleague,  Commissioner  Harbour.  I  thank 

you, both. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Kovacic follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

I. Introduction 

Chairman  Dorgan,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  the 
Federal Trade Commission (‘‘Commission’’ or ‘‘FTC’’) is pleased to appear before you 
today  to  testify  about  the  FTC’s  work  to  protect  consumers  and  promote  competi-
tion,1 and S. llll, a bill to reauthorize the Commission. We look forward to con-
tinuing to work with you to further the interests of American consumers. 

The  FTC  is  the  only  Federal  agency  with  both  consumer  protection  and  competi-
tion  jurisdiction  in  broad  sectors  of  the  economy.2 The  agency  enforces  laws  that 
prohibit  anticompetitive  mergers  and  acquisitions  and  business  practices  that  are 
harmful  to  consumers  because  they  are  anticompetitive,  deceptive,  or  unfair.  The 
FTC also promotes informed consumer choice and understanding of the competitive 
process. 

The  FTC  has  pursued  a  vigorous  and  effective  law  enforcement  program  in  a  dy-
namic  marketplace  that  is  increasingly  global  and  characterized  by  changing  tech-
nologies.  Through  the  efforts  of  a  dedicated,  professional  staff,  the  FTC  continues 
to  handle  a  growing  workload.  This  testimony  highlights  some  of  the  FTC’s  accom-
plishments since the last FTC reauthorization hearing and provides some comments 
on  the  proposed  ‘‘Federal  Trade  Commission  Reauthorization  Act  of  2008.’’ 3 We 
thank  you  for  your  proposed  legislation,  which  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  FTC 
can effectively confront the challenges of the 21st century. 
II. FTC Accomplishments 

The Commission testified on FTC reauthorization in September 2007.4 That testi-
mony  summarized  recent  FTC  accomplishments  in  such  areas  as  data  security  and 
identity  theft,  energy,  real  estate,  technology,  health,  financial  practices,  tele-
marketing fraud and Do Not Call enforcement. 

Since  September,  the  Commission  has  continued  to  be  active  on  competition  and 
consumer  protection  issues.  In  the  competition  area,  we  highlight  a  few  recent  en-
forcement developments. First, in the health care area, the Commission filed a case 
in February 2008, charging that Cephalon, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, engaged 
in  illegal  conduct  to  prevent  competition  for  its  branded  drug,  Provigil,5 by  paying 
four competing firms to refrain from selling generic versions of the drug until 2012.6 
The  Commission’s  complaint  alleges  that  Cephalon’s  conduct  constituted  an  abuse 
of  monopoly  power  that  is  unlawful  under  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act.  We  have  sev-
eral other exclusion payment (‘‘pay-for-delay settlement’’) investigations ongoing. 

1 The written statement represents the views of the Federal Trade Commission. Our oral pres-
entations  and  responses  to  questions  are  our  own  and  do  not  necessarily  reflect  the  views  of 
the Commission or any other Commissioner. 

2 The  FTC  has  broad  law  enforcement  responsibilities  under  the  Federal  Trade  Commission 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq. With certain exceptions, the statute provides the agency with jurisdic-
tion over nearly every economic sector. Certain entities, such as depository institutions and com-
mon carriers, as well as the business of insurance, are wholly or partly exempt from FTC juris-
diction.  In  addition  to  the  FTC  Act,  the  agency  has  enforcement  responsibilities  under  more 
than 50 other statutes and more than 30 rules governing specific industries and practices. 

3 This  testimony  does  not  address  very  recent  changes  to  the  bill,  particularly  new  sections 
10  through  12,  which  were  just  made  available  to  us.  The  Commission  is  examining  these  new 
provisions  and  how  they  intersect  with  other  proposed  provisions  and  indeed,  the  FTC  Act  as 
a whole. We look forward to working with you on these new provisions.

Second, in the energy area, in January 2008, the parties abandoned Equitable Re-
sources’  proposed  acquisition  of  the  Peoples  Natural  Gas  Company,  a  subsidiary  of 
Dominion  Resources,  as  an  FTC  challenge  to  the  acquisition  was  on  appeal.7 Al-
though  the  Federal  district  court  in  Pittsburgh  denied  the  FTC’s  motion  for  a  pre-
liminary  injunction  and  dismissed  the  complaint  last  year  on  state  action  grounds, 
in June 2007, the Third Circuit took the rare step of granting the Commission’s mo-
tion  for  an  injunction  pending  appeal.  In  February  2008,  the  Third  Circuit  granted 
a motion by the Commission to vacate the district court’s ruling that had dismissed 
the complaint.8 The Commission is continuing to examine and address a wide range 
of issues in the energy markets, including its new authority regarding manipulation 
of wholesale crude oil, gasoline, or petroleum distillate markets. 

Finally,  in  January  2008,  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Fifth  Circuit  upheld 
a  Commission  order  requiring  Chicago  Bridge  &  Iron  Co.,  N.V.  and  its  United 
States  subsidiary  (CB&I)  to  divest  assets  acquired  from  Pitt-Des  Moines,  Inc.  used 
in  the  business  of  designing,  engineering,  and  building  field-erected  cryogenic  stor-
age tanks.9 In its 2005 order, the Commission had ruled that CB&I’s acquisition of 
these  assets  in  2001,  during  a  pending  FTC  investigation,  would  likely  result  in  a 
substantial  lessening  of  competition  or  tend  to  create  a  monopoly  in  four  markets 
for  industrial  storage  tanks  in  the  United  States,  in  violation  of  Section  7  of  the 
Clayton  Act  and  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act.  The  court  endorsed  the  Commission’s 
findings,  based  on  an  extensive  review  of  many  years  of  bidding  data,  that  the 
merged firms controlled over 70 percent of the market, and that new entry was un-
likely given the high entry barriers based on the incumbents’ reputation and control 
of skilled crews.10 

In  the  consumer  protection  area,  we  highlight  five  key  FTC  initiatives  since  the 
September  reauthorization  testimony.  First,  the  Commission  is  grateful  for  Con-
gress’ swift legislative action to make participation in the Do Not Call Registry per-
manent  so  that  consumers  will  continue  to  enjoy  its  benefits  without  having  to  re- 
register.  In  November  2007,  the  Commission  announced  six  new  settlements  and 
one new Federal court action against companies that violated the Do Not Call provi-
sions  of  the  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule.  The  six  settlements  resulted  in  $7.7  million 
dollars in civil penalties for Do Not Call violations.11 

Second,  in  the  privacy  and  data  security  area,  the  Commission  announced  five 
new  data  security  cases; 12 released  a  new  online,  interactive  tutorial  to  educate 
businesses on sound data security practices; 13 and hosted workshops on the private 
sector use of Social Security Numbers 14 and behavioral advertising.15 Following the 
workshop on behavioral advertising, the Commission staff released a set of proposed 
principles  to  guide  the  development  of  self-regulation  in  this  area  and  is  seeking 
comment on these principles.16 

Third,  in  the  area  of  financial  practices,  the  Commission  sent  over  200  warning 
letters  to  mortgage  advertisers  and  the  media  outlets  that  carried  their  advertise-
ments  for  home  mortgages.  These  letters  stated  that  the  mortgage  advertisements 
identified may be deceptive, in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, or may violate 
the  Truth-In-Lending  Act.  The  Commission  currently  is  conducting  several  inves-
tigations of mortgage advertisers and subprime lenders and will continue to monitor

10 The Commission continues to appeal its case against Whole Foods Market, Inc.’s acquisition 
of its chief rival, Wild Oats Markets, Inc., on the grounds that the district court failed to apply 
the  proper  legal  standard  that  governs  preliminary  injunction  applications  by  the  Commission 
in Section 7 cases. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will hear oral argu-
ments on this case on April 23, 2008.

claims  made  in  mortgage  advertising.  The  Commission  also  announced  three  cases 
targeting  mortgage  foreclosure  rescue  scams,17 and  three  settlements  against  ‘‘pay-
day lenders’’ who failed to provide consumers with annual percentage rate informa-
tion,  as  required  by  law.18 Fourth,  as  part  of  a  review  of  its  environmental  mar-
keting  guidelines,  also  known  as  the  Green  Guides,19 the  Commission  is  holding  a 
series  of  public  workshops  on  a  number  of  emerging  green  marketing  topics.  The 
first such workshop took place on January 8, 2008, and addressed carbon offsets and 
renewable  energy  certificates.  The  second  workshop,  on  green  packaging,  will  take 
place on April 30, 2008. Finally, this fall, the Commission used its U.S. SAFE WEB 
Act  authority  to  cooperate  with  foreign  partners  in  two  key  matters;  one  involved 
a Canadian-based bogus lottery and prize-promotion scam,20 and the other involved 
an  international  spam  enterprise.21 Since  passage  of  the  Act  in  2006  and  the  pro-
mulgation of rules in May 2007, the SAFE WEB Act has enhanced the FTC’s ability 
to  cooperate  with  foreign  law  enforcement  authorities  on  consumer  protection  en-
forcement matters that cross international borders. 
III. Reauthorization Legislation 

The  remainder  of  this  testimony  addresses  S.  llll,  the  proposed  ‘‘Federal 
Trade Commission Reauthorization Act of 2008.’’ The Commission provides its views 
on the individual sections of the proposed bill below. 
A. Section 2: Authorization of Appropriations 

The Commission supports efforts to increase the agency’s resources to meet its an-
ticipated needs. For the past several years, the Commission has sought an increase 
in funds. We are grateful to Congress for increasing our funding over time. 

The  Commission’s  staff  has  worked  hard  over  the  past  several  years  to  fulfill  its 
mandate, address new and emerging problems in the marketplace, enforce newly en-
acted  laws,  and  complete  the  tasks  Congress  has  entrusted  us  to  address.  In  the 
last few years, Congress has passed a variety of significant new laws that the FTC 
is  charged,  at  least  in  part,  with  implementing  and  enforcing,  such  as  the  CAN– 
SPAM  Act,  the  Fair  and  Accurate  Credit  Transactions  Act,  the  Children’s  Online 
Privacy Protection Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the U.S. SAFE WEB Act. 
Yet it is uncertain whether agency resources have grown apace with our enforce-
ment obligations. To meet its growing challenges, the Commission anticipates need-
ing  additional  resources,  which  might  include,  among  other  things,  more  staff, 
money  to  hire  experts  and  consultants,  additional  office  space,  and  improved  infra-
structure. The Commission understands the draft bill would authorize an additional 
$20 million for technology funding for 2009 through 2015, over and above the reau-
thorization  amount  set  forth  in  Section  2(a)  of  the  bill.  We  thank  the  Committee 
for  specifically  recognizing  the  Commission’s  needs  for  funding  to  improve  its  tech-
nology. We also appreciate the seven-year plan for resources which, if appropriated, 
would allow us to plan for the years ahead. 
B. Section 3 and Section 5. Independent Litigating Authority and Civil Penalties for 

Violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act 

Sections  3  and  5  of  the  proposed  FTC  reauthorization  bill  address  two  substan-
tially intertwined aspects of the Commission’s litigation: the availability of civil pen-
alties  in  court  actions,  and  independent  agency  litigating  authority.  This  section  of 
the  Commission’s  testimony  first  provides  an  overview  of  the  Commission’s  current 
authority to obtain monetary remedies, including civil penalties. Second, it discusses 
the  proposed  extension  of  the  Commission’s  civil  penalty  authority.  Third,  it  ad-
dresses  the  bill’s  proposal  regarding  independent  litigating  authority  to  obtain  civil 
penalties. Fourth, it discusses Commission litigation before the Supreme Court.

1. Overview of Commission’s Authority to Obtain Monetary Remedies 

Although  the  Commission  has  authority  to  seek  civil  penalties  in  some  in-
stances,22 for many violations—including violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act that 
involve  fraudulent  conduct—the  Commission  currently  lacks  general  authority  to 
seek  civil  penalties.23 In  the  past  year,  the  Commission  has  sought  civil  penalties 
in approximately 22 percent of the consumer protection cases it has brought; it has 
had  the  option  of  seeking  civil  penalties  in  approximately  21  percent  of  additional 
consumer protection cases.24 

The  Commission  can  seek  other  types  of  monetary  relief,  including  consumer  re-
dress  and  other  equitable  remedies  such  as  disgorgement  of  ill-gotten  gains,  from 
defendants,  under  Section  13(b)  or  under  Section  19(b)  of  the  FTC  Act  in  certain 
circumstances,  by  filing  Federal  district  court  actions  in  its  own  name,  without  re-
ferral  to  DOJ.25 The  Commission  has  often  used  Section  13(b)  of  the  FTC  Act,  par-
ticularly,  to  obtain  restitution  for  consumers  in  consumer  protection  cases.  In  the 
past decade, the Commission has brought over 600 consumer protection law enforce-
ment actions using Section 13(b) under the FTC Act, through which courts have or-
dered approximately $3 billion in redress for injured consumers. 
2. Additional Civil Penalty Authority 

Section  5  of  S.  XXXX would  give  the  Commission  authority  to  seek  civil  penalties 
for  knowing  violations  of  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act.  As  explained  above,  currently 
the FTC has authority to seek restitution on behalf of consumers and disgorgement 
of ill-gotten gains, but can obtain civil penalties only for certain categories of viola-
tions.26 

In bringing consumer protection law enforcement actions, the Commission’s para-
mount  goal  is  to  stop  unlawful  practices  and  obtain  restitution  for  injured  con-
sumers.  It  achieves  this  goal  primarily  by  filing  actions  directly  in  Federal  district 
court  under  Section  13(b)  of  the  FTC  Act.  In  many  consumer  protection  cases,  and 
most  cases  involving  fraud,  the  Commission  finds  that  the  current  equitable  rem-
edies of restitution and disgorgement give it the power to reach all of a defendant’s 

22 Primarily,  the  FTC  can  seek  civil  penalties  against  any  entity  that  knowingly  violates  a 
trade  regulation  rule  promulgated  by  the  FTC  or  that  violates  a  pre-existing  final  FTC  order 
to which it is subject. Moreover, recognizing the importance of civil penalties, Congress has spe-
cifically  authorized  the  FTC  to  seek  civil  penalties  for  violations  of  certain  statutes,  e.g.,  the 
CAN–SPAM Act, 15 U.S.C. § 7701 et seq. 

23 It  is  unclear  whether  the  proposed  reauthorization  language  in  the  earlier  draft  of  the  bill 
is intended to provide civil penalty authority for consumer protection cases only or for both com-
petition  and  consumer  protection  cases.  Although  civil  penalty  authority  in  competition  cases 
might  provide  a  similar  deterrent  effect,  the  discussion  in  Sections  1  and  2  is  limited  to  civil 
penalty authority in consumer protection cases. 

24 Generally,  as  discussed  below,  the  Commission  cannot  bring  civil  penalty  cases  in  its  own 
right  without  first  presenting  them  to  the  Department  of  Justice  (‘‘DOJ’’)  to  bring  on  behalf  of 
the  Commission.  Almost  invariably,  DOJ  accepts  the  referral,  but  if  it  were  to  decline,  in  most 
instances, the Commission could bring the action in its own name. With one exception, the Com-
mission  cannot  assess  civil  penalties  in  administrative  proceedings.  The  exception  is  set  forth 
in  a  provision  of  the  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  (‘‘EPCA’’),  42  U.S.C.  § 6303(a).  This 
provision (as adjusted pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, see FTC Rules 
of Practice, 16 C.F.R. §§ 1.97, 1.98) authorizes the Commission to assess administratively a civil 
penalty of not more than $110 for each violation of the Appliance Labeling Rule. 

In  some  cases,  we  could  obtain  civil  penalties,  but  we  do  not  because  our  paramount  goal  is 
to return money back to consumers, and defendants do not have enough money to pay consumer 
redress and civil penalties. In other cases, as described on page 13, we are trading civil penalties 
for quicker relief. 

25 See 15 U.S.C. § 53(b); see also 15 U.S.C. § 57b. 
26 When the Federal Trade Commission was established in 1914, it did not have the authority 
to seek civil penalties. Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, Pub. L. No. 63–203, 38 Stat. 717– 
24  (1914).  In  1938,  the  Commission  was  given  the  authority  to  seek  civil  penalties  in  Federal 
district court through the Attorney General against a party for violations of a Commission order 
to  which  that  party  was  subject.  Wheeler-Lea  Act,  Pub.  L.  No.  75–447,  52  Stat.  114–15  (1938). 
When  the  Commission  started  promulgating  rules  in  the  1960s,  it  did  not  have  the  authority 
to seek civil penalties for violations of such rules. 

On  February  4,  1970,  the  Commission  testified  before  Congress  in  favor  of  allowing  the  FTC 
to  assess  civil  penalties  administratively  against  respondents  who  knowingly  committed  con-
sumer protection violations. See Hearings on H.R. 14931 and Related Bills before the Subcomm. 
on Commerce and Finance of the H. Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 91st Cong. 53, 
54  (1970)  (statement  of  FTC  Chairman  Caspar  Weinberger).  The  Senate  passed  legislation  to 
permit  the  FTC  to  seek  civil  penalties  for  such  violations  in  Federal  court  proceedings,  but  it 
was  dropped  in  conference.  Ultimately,  in  1975,  Congress  adopted  legislation  that  authorized 
civil penalties for acts or practices previously determined by the Commission to be unfair or de-
ceptive, through either a rulemaking proceeding or an administrative proceeding, and committed 
with  actual  or  (for  rule  violations)  constructive  knowledge  of  the  determination.  See  15  U.S.C. 
§ 45(m)(1).

available assets. In fact, in many of these cases, defendants do not have enough as-
sets to cover consumer losses, and in such cases, the Commission usually takes the 
available assets and enters a suspended judgment for the remaining amount of con-
sumer injury. 

As the Commission has previously testified, however, in certain categories of cases 
restitution  or  disgorgement  may  not  be  appropriate  or  sufficient  remedies.  These 
categories  of  cases,  where  civil  penalties  could  enable  the  Commission  to  better 
achieve the law enforcement goal of deterrence, include malware (spyware), data se-
curity, and telephone records pretexting.27 In these cases, consumers have not sim-
ply bought a product or service from the defendants following defendant’s misrepre-
sentations,  and  it  is  often  difficult  to  calculate  consumer  losses  or  connect  those 
losses  to  the  violation  for  the  purpose  of  determining  a  restitution  amount. 
Disgorgement  may  also  be  problematic.  In  data  security  cases,  defendants  may  not 
have actually profited from their unlawful acts. For example, in a case arising from 
a  data  security  breach  enabled  by  lax  storage  methods,  the  entity  responsible  for 
the weak security may not have profited from its failure to protect the information; 
rather,  the  identity  thief  who  stole  the  information  likely  profited.28 In  pretexting 
and  spyware  cases,  the  Commission  has  found  that  defendants’  profits  are  often 
slim;  thus,  disgorgement  may  be  an  inadequate  deterrent.  Also  in  pretexting  and 
spyware  cases,  lawful  acts  and  unlawful  acts  may  be  intermixed;  thus,  it  may  be 
difficult  to  determine  an  appropriate  disgorgement  amount.29 And  in  a  whole  host 
of  cases  brought  under  Section  5,  when  we  are  challenging  hard-core  fraud  that 
could  otherwise  be  prosecuted  criminally,  we  should  be  able  to  seek  fines  against 
these wrongdoers. 
3. Independent Litigating Authority for Civil Penalty Actions 

As  noted  above,  before  bringing  a  civil  penalty  action,  the  Commission  generally 
must notify the DOJ of the proposed action.30 If the Department declines to partici-
pate  in  the  name  of  the  United  States  or  otherwise  fails  to  act  within  45  days  on 
such  a  referral,  the  Commission  may  file  the  case  in  its  own  name.31 Section  3(1) 
of the proposed legislation would expand the agency’s independent litigating author-
ity to allow the FTC to bring actions for civil penalties in Federal court ‘‘in its own 
name by any of its attorneys,’’ without mandating that DOJ have the option to liti-
gate on the FTC’s behalf, as is currently required in most cases. Section 3(1) would 
require  the  Commission  to  ‘‘notify  the  Attorney  General  of  any  such  action’’  and 
would  permit  the  Commission  to  ‘‘request  the  Attorney  General  on  behalf  of  the 
Commission to commence, defend, or intervene in any such action.’’ The Commission 
supports this provision. 

Giving  the  FTC  independent  litigating  authority  when  it  seeks  civil  penalties 
would  allow  the  agency  with  the  greatest  expertise  in  the  FTC  Act  to  litigate  some 
of  its  own  civil  penalty  cases,  while  retaining  the  option  of  referring  appropriate 
matters  to  DOJ.  Under  current  law,  agency  staff—who  have  both  general  expertise 
in FTC law and specific knowledge of cases they investigate and recommend for liti-
gation—turn  over  such  cases  to  the  DOJ’s  Office  of  Consumer  Litigation  (OCL). 
While  the  FTC  has  an  excellent  working  relationship  with  OCL  on  these  matters, 
OCL  also  has  responsibility  for  enforcement  matters  relating  to  the  Food  and  Drug 
Administration,  the  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission,  and  the  Department  of 

27 See, e.g., Prepared Statement of the Federal Trade Commission, ‘‘Federal Trade Commission 
Reauthorization,’’ Before the Subcommittee on Interstate Commerce, Trade, and Tourism of the 
Senate  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation  Committee,  110th  Cong.,  September  12,  2007, 
available  at  http://www.ftc.gov/os/testimony/070912reauthorizationtestimony.pdf  (‘‘To  enhance 
consumer  protection  in  cases  involving  spyware,  as  well  as  those  involving  data  security,  the 
Commission continues to support provisions in pending bills that give the FTC civil penalty au-
thority.’’);  Prepared  Statement  of  the  Federal  Trade  Commission,  ‘‘Federal  Trade  Commission 
Reauthorization,’’  Before  the  Senate  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation  Committee,  110th 
Cong., April 10, 2007, available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/testimony/P040101FY2008Budgetand 
OngoingConsumerProtectionandCompetitionProgramsTestimonySenate04102007.pdf (‘‘We believe 
the  Commission’s  ability  to  protect  consumers  from  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices  would 
be  substantially  improved  by  legislation,  all  of  which  is  currently  under  consideration  by  Con-
gress, to provide the Commission with civil penalty authority in the areas of data security, tele-
phone pretexting and spyware.’’). 

28 Defendants  likely  do  save  some  money  from  not  complying  with  legal  mandates.  However, 
the  cost  savings  of  not  instituting  reasonable  data  security  measures  are,  in  many  cases,  small 
and not commensurate with the injury that resulted from the failure. 

29 Most state statutes provide for civil penalties for certain violations of state consumer protec-

tion laws. See, e.g., Ala. Code § 8–19–11; Ark. Code § 4–88–13. 

30 See  supra  note  24.  DOJ  acts  in  a  timely  manner,  filing  cases  on  behalf  of  the  Commission 

and working cooperatively with the Commission and its staff.

Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In contrast, other 
independent Federal agencies are able to maximize the benefits of their own exper-
tise  by  independently  prosecuting  administrative  or  judicial  actions  for  civil  pen-
alties.  For  example,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  has  independent  au-
thority  to  seek  judicial  civil  penalties  for  any  violation  of  the  securities  laws 32 or 
even to assess administrative civil penalties against registered entities.33 Similarly, 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has independent authority to seek ju-
dicial  civil  penalties  or  assess  administrative  civil  penalties.34 Bringing  the  FTC’s 
authority  more  in  line  with  comparable  agencies  would  ensure  that  civil  penalty 
prosecutions fully benefit from the agency’s expertise.35 

Moreover, currently, there are instances in which the Commission confronts ongo-
ing and injurious conduct that violates a rule or statute that provides for civil pen-
alties, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule or the CAN–SPAM Act. In such cases, 
the  Commission  can  bring  an  action  under  Section  13(b)  to  obtain  preliminary  in-
junctive  relief  that  halts  the  ongoing  injury  to  consumers,  or  it  can  refer  an  action 
seeking  civil  penalties  and  other  injunctive  relief  to  DOJ.  The  Commission  cannot, 
however,  do  both.  In  those  instances  where  there  is  a  need  to  bring  ongoing  decep-
tion  or  other  economically-injurious  conduct  to  a  swift  halt,  and  where  justice  re-
quires  both  full  equitable  relief  and  appropriate  civil  penalties,  the  Commission 
should  have  the  option  of  directly  filing  an  action  seeking  both  equitable  and  civil 
penalty relief. The proposed provision would give the Commission this option. 

The  proposed  provision  would  also  increase  efficiency.  Currently,  once  the  FTC 
makes a referral, DOJ has 45 days to commence a civil penalty action. This process 
requires  extra  time  and  delay,  even  under  the  best  of  circumstances,  and  extra  pa-
perwork.  Moreover,  once  DOJ  accepts  a  referral,  the  FTC  normally  assigns  one  or 
more  of  its  own  staff  attorneys,  at  DOJ’s  request,  to  assist  in  litigating  the  case. 
Despite excellent relations and coordination between staff at DOJ and the FTC, the 
use  of  personnel  at  two  agencies  inevitably  creates  delay  and  inefficiencies.  This  is 
particularly  true  in  cases  where  the  FTC  is  simply  referring  to  DOJ  a  settlement 
to be filed. 
4. Independent Litigating Authority Before the Supreme Court 

Section  3(2)  of  the  proposed  legislation  would  allow  the  FTC  to  represent  itself 
before  the  Supreme  Court  in  the  appeal  of  any  litigation  to  which  the  FTC  was  a 
party.  The  Commission  supports  this  provision.  Currently,  in  any  matter  in  which 
the Commission represented itself in the lower courts, the Commission may request 
that the Solicitor General of the DOJ petition for certiorari and represent the Com-
mission before the Supreme Court.36 If the Solicitor General agrees to represent the 
FTC,  under  the  FTC  Act,  he  may  not  compromise  a  Commission  position  or  settle 
the  case  without  Commission  consent.37 If  the  Solicitor  General  declines  to  rep-
resent  the  FTC,  the  Commission  may  petition  the  Court  and  represent  itself.38 Of 
course,  in  any  matter  the  Court  may  request  that  the  Solicitor  General  file  a  brief, 
or the Solicitor General may file an amicus brief without a Court request.39 
C. Section 4. Specialized Administrative Law Judges 

Section  4  would  assist  in  providing  the  FTC  with  ALJs  experienced  in  handling 
complex  antitrust,  trade  regulation,  and  economic  issues  in  adjudications  that  pri-
marily  involve  uncharted  circumstances  or  otherwise  particularly  call  upon  the 
agency’s  expertise.  The  FTC  endorses  the  Committee’s  efforts  to  ensure  that  the 
agency’s ALJs are equal to the highly complex task they face. 

The Commission was created to develop and apply specialized expertise to matters 
concerning unfair methods of competition, and later unfair or deceptive acts or prac-
tices.  The  Commission  may  delegate  its  powers  to  ALJs  (previously  hearing  exam-
iners) to handle administrative trials, but ALJ findings and conclusions both of fact 
and  law  are  subject  to  full  Commission  review,  either  on  appeal  or  pursuant  to  its 
own decision to review a matter.40

34 7 U.S.C. § 9; 7 U.S.C. § 13a; 7 U.S.C. § 13a–1. 
35 The proposed legislation would not authorize the agency to assess administrative penalties, 
which would give an agency more discretion to set policies for obtaining penalties than does the 
ability to seek penalties from a Federal district court.

The  issues  raised  in  antitrust  matters  in  particular,  the  very  substantial  body  of 
law in this area, and the nature of economic evidence, are often sufficiently complex 
to require a person familiar with the law and experienced in handling economic evi-
dence offered in trials. Not every ALJ or aspirant to an ALJ appointment has such 
experience,  and  the  current  process  for  appointments  excludes  such  experience  as 
a factor in making applicants available to the agency. The ability to hire ALJs with 
that  experience  would  help  the  FTC  fulfill  its  role  as  a  specialized,  expert  agency. 
D. Repeal of FTC Act Exemptions 

This section discusses proposed Section 6 and Section 13 of the proposed FTC re-
authorization  bill,  both  of  which  would  repeal  certain  exemptions  to  the  FTC  Act. 
Section  6  would  repeal  the  FTC  Act’s  exemption  for  certain  non-profit  entities,  and 
Section  13  would  repeal  the  common  carrier  exemption.  The  Commission  generally 
supports  repealing  these  exemptions.  In  addition,  Congress  should  examine  other 
exemptions to the FTC Act to more broadly protect consumers and competition and 
to ensure consistent application of laws across economic sectors. 
1. Section 6. Non-Profit Exemption 

Section 6 of the proposed reauthorization legislation would subject charitable, reli-
gious,  educational  and  other  ‘‘section  501(c)(3)’’  organizations  to  the  FTC  Act.  Cur-
rently,  the  FTC’s  jurisdiction  over  non-profits  is  limited.  The  FTC  Act  applies  to 
‘‘persons,  partnerships,  or  corporations,’’ 41 and  the  Act  defines  ‘‘corporation’’  as  an 
entity  that  ‘‘is  organized  to  carry  on  business  for  its  own  profit  or  that  of  its  mem-
bers.’’ 42 Under  this  framework,  the  agency  can  reach  ‘‘sham’’  non-profits,  such  as 
shell non-profit corporations that actually operate for profit.43 It can also reach enti-
ties  falsely  claiming  to  be  affiliated  with  charitable  organizations  and  entities  who 
affirmatively  misrepresent  that  ‘‘donations’’  collected  will  go  to  charity.44 Further, 
the  Commission  has  jurisdiction  over  organizations  such  as  trade  associations  that 
engage  in  activities  that  ‘‘provide[]  substantial  economic  benefit  to  its  for-profit 
members,’’  for  example,  by  providing  advice  and  other  arrangements  on  insurance 
and business matters, or engaging in lobbying activities.45 The Commission also has 
jurisdiction  over  most  non-profits  in  several  discrete  areas,  for  example,  under  cer-
tain  consumer  financial  statutes,  such  as  the  Truth  in  Lending  Act  and  the  Equal 
Credit  Opportunity  Act.46 In  addition,  the  Commission  has  jurisdiction  over  non- 
profit entities for purposes of the Clayton Act,47 most notably Section 7, which pro-
hibits mergers or acquisitions where ‘‘the effect of such acquisition may be substan-
tially  to  lessen  competition,  or  to  tend  to  create  a  monopoly.’’ 48 The  current  defini-
tion  of  ‘‘corporation’’  in  the  FTC  Act  places  substantial  limits  on  the  Commission’s 
jurisdiction  over  non-profit  entities.  While  such  organizations  pursue  many  worthy 
activities  that  advance  important  public  purposes,  on  occasion  they  engage  in  busi-
ness activities that harm consumers. 

The  Commission  supports  extension  of  its  jurisdiction  to  certain  non-profit  enti-
ties.49 In  healthcare,  an  area  in  which  the  Commission  takes  the  lead  to  maintain

43 See, e.g., FTC v. Gill, 183 F. Supp. 2d 1171 (C.D. Cal. 2001) (‘‘[W]hile certain nonprofit cor-
porations are exempt from liability for violations of section 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act, the exemption 
does  not  apply  to  sham  corporations  that  are  the  mere  alter  ego  of  the  [defendant].’’)  (citing

where  FTC  complaint  alleged  that  purported  credit  counseling  organization  incorporated  as  a 
non-profit entity was a ‘‘de facto for-profit organization’’).

vide  substantial  economic  benefits  to  for-profit  members);  American  Medical  Ass’n  v.  FTC,  638 
F.2d  443,  447–448  (1980)  (finding  FTC  jurisdiction  over  non-profit  medical  societies  whose  ac-
tivities ‘‘serve both the business and non-business interests of their member physicians’’).

49 The Commission would be pleased to work with Congressional staff on crafting appropriate 
language.  The  Commission  notes  that,  as  drafted,  Section  6  would  reach  only  those  non-profit 
entities  that  have  tax-exempt  status  under  section  501(c)(3)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  The 
Commission would benefit from broadening this provision to cover certain other nonprofits, such 
as  Section  501(c)(6)  trade  associations.  The  Commission  has  previously  engaged  in  protracted 
litigation  battles  to  determine  whether  such  entities  are  currently  covered  under  the  FTC  Act. 
See,  e.g.,  California  Dental  Ass’n  v.  FTC,  526  U.S.  756,  765–69  (1999)  (holding  that  FTC  Act

competition,  the  agency’s  inability  to  reach  conduct  by  various  non-profit  entities 
has  prevented  the  Commission  from  taking  action  against  potentially  anticompeti-
tive  conduct  of  non-profits  engaged  in  business.  For  example,  the  Commission  gen-
erally  cannot  challenge  price-fixing,  boycotts,  and  other  anticompetitive  conduct  by 
non-profit hospitals. Nearly forty years ago, a Commission order against an associa-
tion  of  non-profit  hospitals  and  a  non-profit  blood  bank  found  to  have  unlawfully 
hindered the development of two commercial blood banks was vacated on the ground 
that the non-profit entities were beyond the FTC’s jurisdiction.50 In three recent en-
forcement  actions,  the  Commission  alleged  that  groups  of  physicians  and  hospitals 
had  participated  in  unlawful  price-fixing  arrangements,  but  sued  only  the  physi-
cians  and  a  for-profit  hospital.51 The  healthcare  sector  includes  a  variety  of  other 
types  of  nonprofit  entities,  such  as  nonprofit  health  maintenance  organizations 
(HMOs), health plans, and standard-setting organizations, whose activities can also 
raise significant competitive concerns. 

The  proposed  legislation  would  also  help  increase  certainty  and  reduce  litigation 
costs  in  this  area.  Although  the  FTC  has  been  successful  in  asserting  jurisdiction 
against  ‘‘sham’’  nonprofits  and  against  non-profit  trade  associations,  the  proposed 
legislation would help avoid protracted factual inquiries and litigation battles to es-
tablish jurisdiction over such entities.52 
2. Section 13. Common Carrier Exception 

Section  13  would  strike  the  telecommunications  common  carrier  exemption  from 
the FTC Act. This exemption bars the agency from reaching certain conduct by tele-
communications  companies.  The  Commission  has  testified  in  favor  of  the  repeal  of 
the  common  carrier  exemption  on  several  occasions,53 continues  to  endorse  its  re-
peal, and thanks the Chairman for his continued support in this area. 

The  FTC  Act  exempts  common  carriers  subject  to  the  Communications  Act  from 
its prohibitions on unfair and deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of com-
petition.54 This  exemption  dates  from  a  period  when  telecommunications  were  pro-

both the business and non-business interests of their member physicians’’).

52 The Commission notes that, just as the First Amendment limits the FTC’s ability to address 
certain  practices  of  for-profit  entities,  it  would  also  restrict  certain  FTC  action  concerning  non- 
profits.  For  example,  in  Riley  v.  National  Federation  of  the  Blind  of  North  Carolina,  Inc.,  487 
U.S. 781 (1988), the Supreme Court struck down a North Carolina law that required fundraisers 
engaged  in  telemarketing  on  behalf  of  charities  to  disclose,  during  the  call,  the  percentage  of 
charitable contributions actually used for charitable purposes. The Supreme Court held that the 
for-profit  fundraisers,  like  charities  soliciting  on  their  own  behalf,  were  engaging  in  ‘‘fully  pro-
tected expression’’ under the First Amendment, and the Court rejected the argument that these 
activities were less-protected ‘‘commercial speech.’’ Id. at 796. The Supreme Court found the law 
to be an ‘‘unduly burdensome’’ prophylactic rule that violated the First Amendment. Id. at 800. 
In 2003, the Court held that the First Amendment does allow a state to assert a fraud claim 
against  a  charity  fundraiser  for  affirmatively  misrepresenting  to  consumers  where  their  money 
will  go.  See  Madigan  v.  Telemarketing  Associates,  Inc.,  538  U.S.  600  (2003).  The  Court  noted, 
though,  that  a  fraud  claim  would  be  dismissed  on  First  Amendment  grounds  if  it  were  based 
simply on a fundraiser’s failure to disclose fee arrangements or the percentage of donated funds 
that were retained by the telefunder. Id. at 617.

vided  by  highly-regulated  monopolies.  The  exemption  is  now  outdated.  In  the  cur-
rent world, firms are expected to compete in providing telecommunications services. 
Congress  and  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (‘‘FCC’’)  have  dismantled 
much of the economic regulatory apparatus formerly applicable to the industry. Re-
moving the exemption from the FTC Act would not alter the jurisdiction of the FCC, 
but  would  give  the  FTC  the  authority  to  protect  against  unfair  and  deceptive  prac-
tices  by  common  carriers  in  the  same  way  that  it  can  protect  against  unfair  and 
deceptive  practices  by  non-common  carriers  engaged  in  the  provision  of  the  same 
services. 

Technological  advances  have  blurred  the  traditional  boundaries  between  tele-
communications,  entertainment,  and  high  technology.55 As  the  telecommunications 
and Internet industries continue to converge, the common carrier exemption is like-
ly to frustrate the FTC’s ability to stop deceptive and unfair acts and practices and 
unfair methods of competition with respect to interconnected communications, infor-
mation, entertainment, and payment services. 

The  FTC  has  extensive  expertise  with  advertising,  marketing,  billing,  and  collec-
tion,  areas  in  which  significant  problems  have  emerged  in  the  telecommunications 
industry.  In  addition,  the  FTC  has  powerful  procedural  and  remedial  tools  that 
could  be  used  effectively  to  address  developing  problems  in  the  telecommunications 
industry if the FTC were authorized to reach them. 
E. Section 7. Aiding and Abetting a Violation 

The  Commission  believes  that  proposed  Section  7,  which  would  give  the  FTC  the 
ability  to  challenge  practices  that  aid  or  abet  violations  of  the  FTC  Act,  could  be 
beneficial  to  the  Commission’s  consumer  protection  law  enforcement  program.  Im-
plicit  in  this  proposed  provision  is  an  understanding  that  effective  law  enforcement 
often  requires  reaching  not  only  the  direct  participants  in  unfair  or  deceptive  prac-
tices,  but  also  those  who  support  and  enable  the  direct  participants  to  violate  the 
law. Since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate 
Bank  of  Denver,  511  U.S.  164  (1994),  however,  the  Commission’s  ability  to  pursue 
those who assist and facilitate unfair or deceptive acts and practices has been com-
promised. The Supreme Court’s broad reasoning in that case cast doubt on the argu-
ment  that  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act  could  reach  ‘‘aiding  and  abetting’’  another  per-
son’s  violation.  Although  the  Commission  has  developed  alternative  theories  to 
reach  secondary  actors,  these  theories  may  make  liability  more  difficult  to  prove 
than  if  the  FTC  had  specific  statutory  authority  in  this  area.56 Indeed,  in  some 
cases,  staff  has  decided  not  to  name  potential  defendants  because  the  conduct  at 
issue did not fit neatly under one of the alternative ‘‘assistance’’ theories.57 

The need for this authority has become particularly clear in the Internet era. Sec-
tion  5  of  the  FTC  Act’s  broad  prohibition  on  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  and  practices 
generally  has  given  the  agency  ample  authority  to  bring  law  enforcement  action 
against  those  who  engage  in  online  fraud.  Many  of  the  new  business  models  that 
are  emerging  on  the  Internet,  however,  involve  numerous  actors  with  murky  and 
varying  roles  in  complicated  channels  of  distribution.  Spyware  distributors,  for  ex-
ample, often use a complex system of affiliates and sub-affiliates to distribute harm-
ful  software  to  consumers,  with  each  of  these  entities  receiving  a  financial  benefit 
from their role in its distribution. In addition, some online businesses located abroad

to. 

55 See Letter from the Federal Trade Commission to John Villafranco and Lewis Rose re Sprint 
Corporation,  http://www.ftc.gov/os/closings/staff/070808sprintnextelclosingltr.pdf.  (FTC  letter 
closing investigation into non-common carrier activities of Sprint, a traditional provider of com-
mon carrier services, related to claims of unlimited web usage via mobile device). 

56 For example, the FTC has used the well-established doctrine that providing the means and 
instrumentalities  by  which  unfair  or  deceptive  practices  occur  is  itself  an  unfair  or  deceptive 
practice  in  violation  of  the  FTC  Act.  See,  e.g.,  FTC  v.  Winstead  Hosiery  Co.,  258  U.S.  483,  494 
(1922). 

57 One statute specifically gives the FTC express authority to pursue aiders and abetters. The 
Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act allowed the Commission to pro-
mulgate  rules  to  include  within  the  definition  of  deceptive  telemarketing  those  who  ‘‘assist  or 
facilitate’’  such  telemarketing.  15  U.S.C.  § 6102(a)(2).  The  Commission’s  Telemarketing  Sales 
Rule (‘‘TSR’’) in turn prohibits providing ‘‘substantial assistance or support to any seller or tele-
marketer  when  that  person  knows  or  consciously  avoids  knowing  that  the  seller  or  tele-
marketer’’  is  engaged  in  certain  practices  that  violate  the  Rule.  The  Commission  has  included 
an  ‘‘assisting  and  facilitating’’  allegation  in  at  least  2  dozen  cases  since  the  TSR  was  adopted. 
See,  e.g.,  Federal  Trade  Commission  v.  Assail,  Inc.,  No.  W03CA007  (W.D.  Tex.  final  orders  en-
tered  Jan.  2005);  U.S.  v.  DirectV,  Inc.,  No.  SACV05  1211  (C.D.  Cal.  final  order  entered  Dec. 
2005); U.S. v. Entrepreneurial Strategies, Ltd., No. 2:06–CV–15 (WCO) (N.D. Ga. final order en-
tered Jan. 2006).

who engage in unfair or deceptive acts and practices that harm American consumers 
rely  on  support  from  entities  located  in  the  United  States.  An  FTC  prosecution  of 
the domestic entity supporting the foreign online business may be the most effective 
means  of  preventing  harm  to  American  consumers.  Making  it  easier  for  the  Com-
mission  to  challenge  those  who  provide  assistance  to  others  who  are  violating  Sec-
tion 5 of the FTC Act could help the agency attack the infrastructure that supports 
Internet fraud, such as in the circumstances described above.58 
F.  Sections  8  and  9.  Rulemaking  Procedure  For  Consumer  Protection,  Subprime 

Lending, and Nontraditional Mortgage Loans 

Section 8 of the proposed FTC reauthorization legislation would allow the FTC to 
conduct rulemaking on any consumer protection issue (other than subprime lending 
and nontraditional mortgage loans) under the streamlined rulemaking procedures of 
Section  553  of  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act  (‘‘APA’’)  that  are  generally  avail-
able to Federal agencies. Congress has heretofore authorized the Commission to con-
duct  general  rulemaking  only  under  the  rigorous,  complicated,  and  time-consuming 
procedures of Section 18 of the FTC Act. Section 18 includes requirements that the 
FTC  must  publish  an  advance  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  and  seek  public  com-
ment before publishing its notice of proposed rulemaking; it must provide an oppor-
tunity  for  a  hearing  before  a  presiding  officer  at  which  interested  persons  are  ac-
corded  certain  cross-examination  rights;  and  where  there  are  numerous  interested 
persons,  the  FTC  must  determine  which  have  similar  interests,  have  each  group  of 
persons with similar interests choose a representative, and make further determina-
tions  about  representation  for  those  interests  in  the  cross-examination  process. 
These requirements are not ordinarily applicable to other Federal agencies for com-
parable rulemaking. 

In addition, over the past 15 years, there have been a number of occasions where 
Congress has identified specific consumer protection issues requiring legislative and 
regulatory action. In these specific instances, Congress has given the FTC authority 
to issue rules using APA rulemaking procedures, and the Commission has supported 
this approach. 

Section 9 would provide for the Commission to conduct rulemaking under the APA 
with  respect  to  subprime  mortgage  lending  and  nontraditional  mortgage  loans.  The 
Commission  previously  has  supported  proposals  to  permit  all  responsible  agencies 
to promulgate consistent and comparable rules in the financial services area.59 Cur-
rent  differences  in  rulemaking  procedures  may  result  in  different  regulatory  re-
quirements for financial service providers selling the same goods. To avoid the appli-
cation  of 
interagency  coordination  on 
rulemakings,  and  to  ensure  that  any  FTC  rulemaking  does  not  lag  years  behind 
other financial regulators, the FTC believes that it should have the authority to use 
APA  procedures  to  promulgate  rules  whenever  the  banking  agencies  and  National 
Credit Union Administration commence rulemaking under the FTC Act.

Thank you for giving the Commission the opportunity to provide its views on the 
proposed  FTC  Reauthorization  bill.  We  are  grateful  for  Congress’  confidence  in  the 
FTC’s ability to protect consumers, and, through our enforcement and education ef-

sion  of  the  Act  or  any  other  Act  enforceable  by  the  Commission,’’  which  would  include  aiding 
and  abetting  unfair  methods  of  competition.  It  is  unclear  how  this  is  intended  to  apply  to  com-
petition cases, or whether application to competition cases is necessary.

STATEMENT OF HON. PAMELA JONES HARBOUR, 
COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

buchar. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Dorgan  and  Senator  Klo-

I’m  pleased  to  appear  before  you  today.  In  particular,  I  would 
like  to  highlight  recent  efforts  and  accomplishments  of  the  Com-
mission in both the competition and consumer protection areas. 

Merger investigations are always a high priority at the Commis-
sion. This past January, the Commission enjoyed a resounding win 
on  the  merger  front  when  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  5th 
Circuit  upheld  a  Commission  Order  in  the  Chicago  Bridge  &  Iron 
Matter. 

In 2005, the Commission had ruled that Chicago Bridge & Iron’s 
acquisition  of  assets  from  a  competitor  was  likely  to  substantially 
lessen  competition  or  tend  to  create  a  monopoly  in  markets  for 
cryogenic storage tanks used in a variety of industrial applications. 
The  Commission  had  ordered  divestitures  to  undo  the  deal  and 
restore competition. The 5th Circuit’s recent opinion fully endorsed 
the Commission’s findings. 

Pharmaceutical  markets  have  long  been  a  critical  area  of  focus 
for  the  Commission  and  we  continue  to  be  vigilant  in  protecting 
pharmaceutical  competition.  For  example,  this  past  February,  the 
Commission filed a case charging that Cephalon, a pharmaceutical 
manufacturer,  unlawfully  blocked  competition  for  a  branded  drug 
by  paying  four  generic  firms  to  stay  off  the  market  until  the  year 
2012. 

We  are  investigating  similar  exclusion  payments  involving  other 

pharmaceutical firms as well. 

Of  course,  we  also  pay  close  attention  to  a  wide  range  of  issues 
in energy markets. We are considering how best to use our new en-
forcement authority regarding the manipulation of wholesale crude 
oil, gasoline and petroleum distillate markets. 

It  is  also  worth  noting  the  Commission’s  recent  challenge  of  the 
proposed  acquisition  by  Equitable  Resources  of  the  People’s  Nat-
ural  Gas  Company,  a  subsidiary  of  Dominion  Resources.  This 
transaction was abandoned by the parties in January of 2008. 

In  April  of  last  year,  we  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  keep  gaso-
line  prices  from  going  up  in  Albuquerque,  New  Mexico.  We  sought 
a  preliminary  injunction  in  Federal  court  in  New  Mexico  to  stop 
Western Refining, Inc.’s, acquisition of Giant Industries, but unfor-
tunately  the  district  court  did  not  believe  the  merger  would  cause 
gasoline prices to increase. 

On the competition front, the Commission just announced settle-
ments  with  retailer  TJX  and  data  broker,  Reed,  Elsevier  and 
Seisint,  settling  charges  that  the  companies  failed  to  provide  rea-
sonable and appropriate security for sensitive personal information. 
These  cases  bring  the  total  number  of  data  security  enforcement 
actions to 20, but rather than celebrate this milestone, we will use 
it  to  remind  ourselves  and  the  larger  business  community  how 
much more work awaits us in this important area. 

Our data security cases typically allege multiple and systemic se-
curity vulnerabilities that were easily and inexpensively avoidable. 
This  suggests  that  companies  must  do  more  to  protect  sensitive 
consumer information.

The  Commission  will  continue  to  educate  consumers  and  busi-
nesses  about  protecting  personal  information  and  we  will  continue 
to  hold  companies  accountable  for  their  information  security  prac-
tices. 

We are tremendously gratified that Congress expanded the Com-
mission’s ability to cooperate with our foreign counterparts through 
the  U.S.  SAFE  WEB  Act.  The  law  added  new  enforcement-sharing 
tools into the Commission’s law enforcement arsenal and allows us 
to pursue a wider range of cross-border enforcement matters. Since 
the rules went into effect in May 2007, the Commission has shared 
information  17  times  with  foreign  agencies  in  cross-border  con-
sumer  protection  matters 
fraudulent  telemarketing 
scams, deceptive mail schemes and spam cases. 

involving 

The  Commission  has  also  used  its  new  authority  to  provide  in-
vestigative  assistance  to  foreign  agencies  in  multiple  Internet-re-
lated  investigations.  In  short,  the  increasing  use  of  the  FTC’s  new 
authority is removing some of the key roadblocks to effective inter-
national  enforcement  cooperation  and  the  Commission  will  con-
tinue to focus on U.S. SAFE WEB in 2008. 

Let  me  end  with  mortgage  lending.  It  has  long  been  a  Commis-
sion priority. In the past decade, the agency, as you have correctly 
noted,  Chairman  Dorgan,  brought  21  actions  focused  on  the  mort-
gage lending industry, alleging that mortgage brokers, lenders and 
servicers  have  engaged  in  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  and  practices 
and  these  cases  have  collectively  returned  more  than  $320  million 
to consumers. 

In  February,  the  Commission  announced  three  actions  against 
companies  that  allegedly  made  false  guarantees  to  homeowners 
that they would save their homes from foreclosure. In one case, the 
Commission  charged  that  the  company  enticed  consumers  into  a 
second mortgage or home equity line of credit on unfavorable terms 
without  fully  disclosing  the  risks,  the  costs  and  consequences  of 
doing so. 

In  conjunction  with  these  cases,  the  Commission  launched  a  re-
lated consumer education effort which included a fact sheet on how 
to avoid foreclosure rescue scams, a series of radio PSAs in English 
and  in  Spanish,  and  warnings  about  foreclosure  rescue  schemes 
which  we  will  place  in  the  classified  ad  sections  of  English  and 
Spanish language community newspapers. 

And  finally,  the  Commission  likewise  has  been  active  in  its  ef-
forts  to  protect  consumers  of  non-mortgage  financial  services.  The 
agency  announced  in  February  consent  agreements  with  three 
Internet  pay  day  lenders  who  advertised  the  cost  of  their  loans 
without  disclosing  the  annual  percentage  rate  in  violation  of  the 
Truth in Lending Act. This violation makes it far more difficult for 
consumers  to  comparison  shop  between  pay  day  loans  and  other 
short-term forms of credit. 

And  the  Commission  has  also,  as  you  correctly  mentioned,  sent 
out  warning  letters  to  over  200  mortgage  brokers  and  lenders  and 
the  media  that  carry  their  ads  that  their  advertising  claims  may 
violate  Federal  law.  As  a  follow  up  to  the  mortgage  advertising 
sweep,  the  Commission  is  investigating  a  number  of  these  mort-
gage  advertisers  and  we  will  continue  to  monitor  these  claims  and

if  the  Chairman  desires,  we  can  give  you  a  private  briefing  at  a 
later date. 

I thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Commissioner  Harbour,  thank  you  very  much. 
Commissioner Leibowitz? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JONATHAN D. LEIBOWITZ, 
COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator  Dorgan,  Senator 

Klobuchar. 

Let me begin by underscoring how much we appreciate your very 
ambitious legislation to reauthorize the Federal Trade Commission. 
My colleagues have asked me to focus on two provisions today: au-
thority  to  bring  civil  enforcement  actions  against  those  who  aid  or 
abet illegal acts, and authority to seek civil penalties for violations 
of the FTC Act. Both provisions are designed to provide strong de-
terrence to would-be lawbreakers. 

First,  aiding  and  abetting.  The  Commission  unequivocally  sup-
ports  Section  7  of  the  bill  to  the  extent  it  would  prohibit  aiding  or 
abetting a violation of any consumer protection statute enforced by 
the Commission. 

For  many  years,  our  agency  relied  on  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act 
to  pursue  not  only  direct  violators  but  also  those  who  assisted  vio-
lations.  The  Supreme  Court’s  ruling  in  Central  Bank  of  Denver  in 
1994,  however,  compromised  our  ability  to  reach  such  aiders  and 
abettors. 

Since  then,  we  have  developed  alternative  theories  to  prosecute 
secondary  actors,  but  as  both  of  you  are  aware,  sometimes  it  can 
be  very  difficult  to  prove  liability.  Indeed,  in  some  cases,  we  have 
been  unable  to  bring  actions  against  potential  defendants  who  en-
abled illegal behavior. Clear enforcement authority would certainly 
help. 

In  fact,  we  already  have  this  authority  for  telemarketing  fraud. 
Pursuant  to  a  1994  law,  the  FTC’s  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule  pro-
hibits assisting and facilitating violations. It has enabled us to suc-
cessfully  prosecute,  for  example,  brokers  who  knowingly  provided 
lead  lists  to  scammers  so  they  could  easily  find  victims,  and  pay-
ment  processors  who  electronically  debited  consumers’  accounts  on 
behalf  of  obviously  fraudulent  enterprises.  But  the  rule  is  limited 
to telemarketing violations. 

Now, why give a pass to facilitators of unlawful schemes that use 
the  Internet  or  the  mail—but  not  to  those  that  use  the  telephone? 
To  ask  the  question  is  to  answer  it.  Authority  to  prosecute  aiders 
and abettors would be an effective law enforcement tool, as well as 
a strong deterrent for malefactors and their accomplices. 

Second, civil penalties. Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits 
unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices,  as  well  as  unfair  methods  of 
competition,  is  the  ‘‘bread  and  butter’’  of  our  law  enforcement  pro-
gram. The FTC may seek equitable remedies for violations, includ-
ing  restitution  for  injured  consumers  and  disgorgement  of  profits 
from  violators.  We  use  these  remedial  tools  often  and  generally 
very successfully. But the Commission doesn’t have authority to ob-
tain fines for Section 5 violations.

The FTC’s civil penalty authority is effectively restricted to three 
circumstances:  violations  of  statutes  that  authorize  civil  penalties, 
like  COPPA  or  CAN–SPAM;  knowing  violations  of  FTC  rules;  and 
violations  of  administrative  cease  and  desist  orders,  that  is,  when 
we  have  you  under  order  already.  Thus,  a  wide  range  of  deceptive 
or  unfair  conduct,  including  outright  fraud,  may  not  be  subject  to 
this sanction. 

Your  bill,  Senator  Dorgan,  would  authorize  the  Commission  to 
seek  fines  for  knowing  violations  of  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act.  The 
Commissioners  all  agree  that  we  need  additional  civil  penalty  au-
thority  in  certain  categories  of  cases  where  the  usual  FTC  mone-
tary remedies, restitution and disgorgement, are inadequate. In re-
cent  years,  we’ve  testified  in  support  of  authorizing  fines  for 
spyware,  for  data  security  breaches  and  for  telephone  record 
pretexting.  These  are  all  instances  in  which  it  can  be  difficult  to 
quantify  consumer  harm  or  in  which  the  defendant’s  ill-gotten 
gains are often slim, non-existent or difficult to determine. 

Admittedly, there is some debate about how far our civil penalty 
authority  should  extend.  Some  believe  that  Congress  should  au-
thorize  civil  penalties  piecemeal,  in  discreet  areas,  as  problems 
arise,  or  that  the  broad  liability  for  unfair  or  deceptive  practices 
under  the  FTC  Act  should  only  be  coupled  with  narrow  remedies. 
Others,  however,  support  your  bill’s  approach  of  permitting  civil 
fines  for  a  wide  range  of  deceptive  and  unfair  acts,  as  well  as  for 
antitrust violations. The authority you would give us would be tem-
pered  by  allowing  only  Federal  judges  to  impose  the  penalties  and 
only for knowing violations. 

In  the  early  1970s,  the  Commission,  under  former  FTC  Chair-
man  Caspar  Weinberger,  recommended  that  Congress  give  the 
agency  authority  to  assess  civil  penalties  administratively  for  con-
sumer  protection  violations.  In  testimony  before  this  Committee, 
Chairman  Weinberger  called  for,  and  I  quote,  ‘‘stronger  and  more 
comprehensive  tools  to  make  the  threat  of  a  Commission  pro-
ceeding a real deterrent to a lawbreaker.’’ 

In  response,  this  Committee  and  the  Senate  passed  legislation 
authorizing  the  FTC  to  seek  fines  in  Federal  court,  which  is  what 
your  bill  would  do,  but  this  provision  was  dropped  in  conference 
with the House. 

We  are  all  pleased  that  you  are  revisiting  this  issue  today  and, 
speaking  for  myself,  I  strongly  support  the  proposed  reauthoriza-
tion, including the additional civil penalty authority. Your bill, I be-
lieve, will help give us the critical tools we need to successfully con-
front  the  antitrust  and  consumer  protection  challenges  of  the  21st 
century. 

Thank  you  for  letting  me  participate  in  this  hearing,  and  I’d  be 

happy to answer questions after my colleague speaks. 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Leibowitz, thank you very much. 
Finally, we’ll hear from Commissioner Rosch. 
STATEMENT OF HON. J. THOMAS ROSCH, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Mr.  ROSCH.  Chairman  Dorgan,  Senator  Klobuchar,  thank  you 
very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  be  before  you  today  and  testify 
about the proposed bill that would reauthorize the FTC.

I’d like to focus on two aspects of the bill that are of special inter-
est  to  me.  The  first  is  granting  the  Commission  independent  liti-
gating  authority  for  civil  penalties  in  matters  before  the  Supreme 
Court, and the second is the agency’s rulemaking procedures. 

Commissioner Leibowitz has just described the agency’s need for 
civil penalties. Speaking for myself, I favor the proposed legislation 
and  along  with  my  colleagues,  I  strongly  favor  granting  the  Com-
mission’s  civil  penalty  authority  in  specific  areas  we’ve  identified 
today  and  in  prior  testimony,  like  data  security  and  spyware  and 
pretexting. 

But  whatever  the  ultimate  scope  of  civil  penalty  authority  that 
Congress  grants  to  the  Commission,  my  fellow  Commissioners  and 
I believe that giving the agency the ability to independently litigate 
civil penalty actions is necessary for the agency to fully protect con-
sumers. 

Now I don’t want to leave the impression that there’s been a con-
flict  with  DOJ  in  litigating  these  cases.  In  fact,  we’ve  collaborated 
successfully  on  many  civil  penalty  cases  over  the  years,  but  there 
are  two  primary  reasons  why  the  current  process  in  our  opinion 
doesn’t serve consumers well. 

First,  the  Commission  invests  significant  resources  investigating 
and sometimes settling civil penalty matters before filing an action, 
and  even  after  referral  to  DOJ,  Commission  staff  are  assigned  to 
the  case  to  assist  in  litigating  the  matter.  So  the  referral  process 
doesn’t  free  up  significant  Commission  resources,  particularly  in 
settlements,  and  in  fact,  sometimes  leads  to  the  duplication  of  ef-
forts. 

Second,  the  Commission’s  often  faced  with  ongoing  consumer 
harm  in  cases  that  violate  both  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act  and  one 
or more specific civil penalty statutes. 

When  the  Commission  exercises  its  independent  litigating  au-
thority  under  Section  13(b),  we  can  file  an  action  immediately  and 
seek  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  other  immediate  remedies 
to  stop  the  violative  conduct.  In  these  types  of  cases,  though,  we 
must  forego  civil  penalties  all  together  and  file  the  case  seeking 
only  redress  and  injunctive  relief  under  Section  13(b)  in  order  to 
get to court quickly. 

I frankly have been appalled at the large sums of money that de-
fendants take in from deceptive or unfair practices. So, I find it es-
pecially frustrating that at the end of a case, we may be unable to 
achieve the fullest possible measure of deterrence. 

A related provision in the reauthorization bill gives the Commis-
sion  authority  to  independently  litigate  its  actions  before  the  Su-
preme Court. I fully support the proposed legislation in this regard. 
At the end of the day, I think the issue of litigation authority de-
termines  whether  the  Commission  is  truly  an  independent  law  en-
forcement agency. 

Both  in  my  prior  tenure  at  the  Commission  and  in  my  current 
tenure,  I’ve  understood  that  is  what  you,  the  Congress,  wanted  us 
to be. Giving the Commission independent authority to litigate civil 
penalty actions and to pursue our own appeals before the Supreme 
Court would help solidify the Commission’s independent status. 

Finally,  I  turn  to  the  proposal  to  give  the  Commission  authority 
to conduct rulemaking on a notice and comment basis. I was at the

agency when Magnuson-Moss was passed. At that time, none of us 
fully  appreciated  what  a  burdensome  process  Mag-Moss  rule-
making would turn out to be as compared to the rulemaking proce-
dures under Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act which 
are applicable to a whole host of other agencies. 

We  did  understand  that,  given  the  breadth  of  Section  5  of  the 
FTC  Act,  there  may  be  a  need  to  give  some  notice  to  industry  of 
some  of  the  practices  that  would  trigger  civil  penalties,  but  we 
didn’t envisage that the process would in effect make it difficult or 
impossible  to  enact  rules  in  a  timely  manner  to  respond  to  con-
sumer protection challenges. 

I know there are differing opinions among the Commissioners on 
this  point,  but  speaking  for  myself  alone,  I  think  that  APA  rule-
making  authority  for  consumer  protection  matters  would  greatly 
increase  the  Commission’s  effectiveness  in  dealing  with  certain 
types of practices. 

The  subprime  mortgage  lending  area,  which  is  specifically  men-
tioned in the reauthorization bill, is one prime example. Now to be 
clear,  I’m  not  advocating  wholesale  and  burdensome  regulation  of 
industries.  I  know  the  agency  has  learned  from  the  past,  particu-
larly the Kid Vid controversy in the 1970s, but in this day and age, 
the ability to conduct streamlined APA rulemaking would be a val-
uable  tool  in  our  arsenal  to  respond  more  quickly  to  some  difficult 
consumer protection problems. 

Thank  you  for  all  of  your  time  and  your  support  of  this  agency 
and its mission, and I’m happy to answer any questions you might 
have. 

Senator DORGAN. Commissioner Rosch, thank you very much. 
I  don’t  think  we  should  worry  too  much  about  someone  thinking 
we  might  want  to  impose  some  additional  regulations.  The  fact  is 
that  we  now  see,  as  I  said  earlier,  $30  billion  of  taxpayers’  money 
ponied up to bail out an investment bank that was unregulated be-
cause  it  was  too  big  to  fail.  Well,  if  it’s  too  big  to  fail,  it  ought  to 
be big enough to be regulated so that we could take a look at what 
they’re  doing  and  try  to  bring  some  of  their  practices  back  into 
some sensibility. 

I want to ask a couple of questions about subprime and deceptive 
advertising especially. You have such a wide agenda, but I want to 
focus on this just for a moment. 

The  three  charts  that  I  showed  previously,  let  me  show  them 
again quickly, and I’m going to ask you a couple questions because 
I  pulled  this  one  off  the  Internet  yesterday.  This  is  advertising  as 
of  yesterday  on  the  Internet.  It’s  April  7,  2008.  You  can  get  a  30- 
year fixed rate mortgage, two and three-quarters percent. 

Does  anybody  believe  that  you  can  get  a  30-year  fixed  mortgage 
for two and three-quarters percent? That’s what was advertised on 
the  Internet  yesterday.  It  seems  to  me  like  that’s  clearly  deceptive 
advertising. 

Second  one.  Yes.  Well,  they  also  advertised  that  one  of  the  won-
derful  things  is  you  don’t  have  to  document  your  income.  No  doc 
and  low  doc.  This  is  5-year  fixed  payments  for  one  and  a  quarter 
percent interest rate. 

Now,  why  is  this  deceptive?  Because  anything  you  don’t  pay  in 
the  front  end  is  put  on  the  back  end  of  this  mortgage  and  will  in-

crease the cost of purchasing that home. But, that’s not there. That 
is  nowhere  in  the  advertisement.  They  say  use  these  low  rates  to 
control up to two to three times as much real estate versus conven-
tional fixed-rate mortgages. 

What  they’re  saying  is  come  in  and  get  a  teaser  rate  and  specu-
late. Deceptive advertising? Seems to me it probably is. Finally—— 
Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  Well,  let  me  just  add,  it  may  also  be  violative  of 
the  FTC  Act  because  in  fact  they  are  telling  you  that  you  don’t 
need  to  provide  financial  documents,  right?  That’s  also  very  trou-
bling. 

Senator DORGAN. They’re not only telling you that, that’s the way 

many of these subprime mortgages were given. 

I mean, I was surprised to hear that—— 
Mr. LEIBOWITZ. That’s right. 
Senator DORGAN.—no doc and low doc means you can get a loan 
without  having  to  document  your  income  to  the  mortgage  lender. 
I  mean,  obviously  that  sounds  like  a  bunch  of  drunks  out  there 
playing a joke on somebody, but it’s the way this system was work-
ing. 

You pay a slightly higher interest rate for a no doc or a low doc, 
but let me just go with the last chart. This is one quarter of 1 per-
cent  interest  only  rate.  That’s  for  5  years.  So,  they’re  saying  a 
$200,000 loan for your house, you have a house payment of $41.66 
a month. Now that’s on the Internet today. 

Now,  I’m  asking  the  question  because  everybody  talks  about, 
well,  who’s  at  fault  here?  These  folks  have  got  these  mortgages. 
They’re not victims. They knew what they were doing. But in many 
cases,  brokers  were  cold  calling  people  that  were  already  in  a 
home,  saying  we’ll  put  you  in  a  better  mortgage.  One-half  of  the 
new  mortgages,  subprime  mortgages  went  to  people  who  qualified 
for  a  prime  mortgage,  one-half  went  to  people  who  qualified  for  a 
prime  mortgage,  and  yet  they  were  stuck  in  the  subprime  and 
stuck  in  a  subprime  in  most  cases  with  prepayment  penalties  and 
so on. 

The  point  is  this.  In  my  judgment,  there  was  massive  deception 
going  on,  massive  deception  with  respect  to  this  question  of  mort-
gage  advertising  and  they’re  all  involved.  I  mean,  I  showed  you 
Countrywide was the biggest. I showed you what they were adver-
tising.  They  were  saying  to  consumers,  you  have  bad  credit,  you 
have credit problems, you’ve been bankrupt, come to us, let us loan 
you  some  money  because  this  was  very  profitable  and  at  the  top, 
they  were  all  grunting  and  shoving  and,  you  know,  like  hogs  in  a 
trough and making lots and lots and lots of money. 

So,  how  did  this  happen  that  all  of  this  occurs  without  the  Fed-
eral  Trade  Commission  being  able  to  step  in  and  write  a  rule  that 
relates to what is required with respect to this advertising? Tell me 
what  the  deficiency  is  with  respect  to  your  ability  to  have  stepped 
in  several  years  ago  and  see  what’s  going  on  and  say,  wait  a  sec-
ond,  you’ve  got  to  stop  it  or  face  substantial  penalties  if  you  don’t. 

Mr. Rosch? 
Mr.  ROSCH.  I  guess  I  have  rulemaking.  I  would  say  that  I  draw 
a distinction between deception on the one hand and unfairness on 
the other. Both are covered by the FTC Act.

When you’re talking about some of the ads that you’ve shown us 
today, you’re talking about outright deception. We don’t need a rule 
to  go  after  that,  and  in  fact  we  may  be  going  after  some  of  those 
companies already. 

Where we do need a rule is where we’re talking about unfairness. 
As  you  said  before,  some  of  these  companies  were  actually  deliv-
ering  on  what  they  said.  They  were  loaning  without  any  require-
ment whatever with respect to income, et. cetera. 

Now that is arguably unfair, but what a rule would do is to pro-
hibit companies from making those kinds of promises and granting 
loans on those conditions. What that does is it puts them on notice 
that we will consider this to be an unfair practice. 

Now  why  is  your  bill  so  important?  It’s  important  because  our 
Mag-Moss  authority  right  now,  which  is  the  only  rulemaking  au-
thority we’ve got, takes us anywhere from three to 9 years to make 
a rule. It’s just impossible for us to be ahead of the curve on some-
thing like this. 

With  APA  rulemaking,  we  can  get  a  rule  in  place  very  quickly. 
Senator  DORGAN.  I’m  a  little  lost  with  respect  to  deceptive  and 
unfair,  and  I  suppose  that  those  are  terms  of  art,  but  it  seems  to 
me  if  you’re  advertising  in  a  deceptive  way,  it’s  also  unfair  to  the 
person that is receiving the message. 

But  what  you’re  saying  is  as  the  subprime  activity  ramped  up, 
and  it  happened  in  a  big  hurry  over  a  period  of  three,  five,  six 
years,  all  of  a  sudden  we  saw  this  unbelievable  mountain  of 
subprime  lending:  no  doc,  low  doc,  interest  only,  partial  interest 
only,  defer  some  of  the  interest  and  the  principal,  all  of  these 
things.  It  seems  to  me  almost  all  of  the  advertising  I  saw  was  de-
ceptive. Nobody ever said and, oh, by the way, we’ll stick all of this 
extra  cost  on  the  end  of  your  mortgage  and  your  house  is  going  to 
cost more. 

So,  did  you  not  have  much  authority?  I  know  you’ve  gone  after 
some  individually,  but  did  you  not  have  authority  to  write  a  rule 
in  this  process  to  say  here’s  the  rule  that  you’ve  got  to  follow, 
here’s the process you’ve got follow? 

Mr.  ROSCH.  We  did,  but  here’s  the  beauty  of  your  legislation, 
Senator.  It  is  that  the  rulemaking  authority  that  we  had  to  make 
a rule required us to spend anywhere from three to 9 years making 
that rule. 

What your authority would do, by giving us the authority to pro-
ceed  under  APA  rulemaking,  like  most  other  agencies,  it  would 
allow us to shorten that rulemaking time very substantially. 

Mr. LEIBOWITZ. So that we can help consumers and just following 
up  on  Commissioner  Rosch’s  point,  we  have  had  discussions  inter-
nally about whether to do a rule and it always ended with us deter-
mining that Mag-Moss rulemaking procedures will take us so long, 
it won’t be worthwhile. For example, under Mag-Moss, which is an 
almost  Medieval  form  of  rulemaking—one  that  turns  rulemaking 
on its head—opponents of the rule can ask for a referee. They have 
rights of cross examination. 

When you’re looking at a 9-year rule, an 11-year rule, with oppo-
sition  from  the  entire  industry,  and  you  could  be  sure  they’d  be  in 
opposition to what we wanted to accomplish. That’s why I like your 
general  grant  of  APA  rulemaking  authority  when  we  see  a  major

problem  like  this,  and  that’s  why  specifically  with  respect  to  the 
subprime  mortgage  crisis,  that  provision  of  your  bill  will  be  enor-
mously helpful to us. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  should  make  the  point  that,  you  know,  there 
are  some  mortgage  lenders  out  there  that  are  doing  it  the  right 
way.  They’ve  got  good  brokers.  They’re  doing  the  right  thing.  No-
body  can  come  up  and  say  I’m  going  to  buy  a  home  and,  by  the 
way,  here’s  the  cash.  You  need  home  loans.  You  need  mortgages. 
It’s a very important industry to allow for homeownership. 

But  it  is  the  case  that  if  you  look  very  deep  into  this  system,  in 
the  last  few  years,  four  or  5  years  especially,  this  thing  spun  way 
out  of  control  with  deception,  with  unfairness,  a  whole  series  of 
things,  and  it  seems  to  me  that  you  all  didn’t  have  the  capability 
which  is  why  we  made  a  change  in  this  law  or  proposed  law.  You 
didn’t  have  the  capability  to  write  a  rule  to  prevent  this.  You  can 
go after them after the fact perhaps, but it seems to me you’ve got 
to be ahead of this to prevent the activity. 

Ms. Harbour? 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  Chairman,  yes,  I  agree  with  that,  and  just  step-
ping  back  a  bit  and  looking  at  this  in  the  historical  context,  the 
housing sector at one point was booming. We used to call this sort 
of behavior predatory lending and then it was changed to subprime 
lending. 

Many  consumers  who  were  not  able  to  buy  homes  were  able  to 
purchase  them.  However,  because  we  didn’t  have  the  rulemaking 
capability  under  the  APA,  we  were  bringing  these  cases  under  our 
traditional  Section  5  authority—we  brought  21  cases  over  the  past 
10 years and returned $320 million to consumers. 

But  this  new  rulemaking  ability  will  give  us  enforcement  tools 

which we will be able to use to be more vigilant in this area. 

Senator  DORGAN.  The  21  cases  doesn’t  sound  like  much  to  me 

when I see what was out there. 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  But  you  know  what,  Senator?  These  cases  are 
very,  very  resource-intensive.  So,  in  addition  to  the  APA  rule-
making  authority  that  hopefully  will  be  granted,  also  the  funding 
and the monies to bring on extra attorneys to investigate and bring 
cases would be very helpful to the Commission. 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Senator,  could  I  add  that  as  these  phenomena  de-
veloped, I suspect it’s largely recognized now that if the bubble had 
not  burst  and  if  the  boom  had  continued,  many  of  the  problems 
would not have manifest themselves. 

As  a  number  of  the  practices  came  to  our  attention,  in  addition 
to  bringing  the  cases  that  my  colleague  has  just  mentioned,  we 
started  programs  to  learn  about  what  was  taking  place  as  this 
wave unfolded. 

This  was  the  purpose  of  the  many  workshops  that  we’ve  spoken 
about  in  previous  appearances.  It’s  the  reason  that  our  Bureau  of 
Economics  turned  their  attention  as  dramatically  as  they  did  to 
doing empirical work and studies about mortgage lending. It’s why 
for  the  agency,  by  my  rough  count  of  the  300  attorneys  we  now 
have working in the consumer protection part of our agency, rough-
ly  50  of  them  now  are  spending  their  time  on  financial  practices, 
financial services.

So,  I  would  just  add  that,  in  addition  to  the  litigation  program, 
we’re trying to learn as fast as we can about what was transpiring 
and to reposition the agency to deal with this. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  understand.  I’m  just  saying  the  lack  of  regu-
lations,  however,  are  costing  this  country  hundreds  of  billions  of 
dollars and if we can get this legislation passed, we’re going to give 
you a new authority. 

It’s  very  important  that  the  Federal  agency  like  yours  not  be  a 
potted plant. Giving you the authority is one thing, using it is quite 
another,  and  it’s  very  important  that  it  be  used  in  the  right  way 
and used aggressively. 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  And  Senator,  could  I  suggest  that  there’s  a  model 

that you mentioned before that might be followed here? 

The Do Not Call rule in many ways evolved in roughly the same 
way.  The  life  cycle  of  our  work  was  extensive  litigation  under  the 
Telemarketing  Sales  Act,  reflection,  workshops,  data-gathering, 
and  then  the  time  came  where  the  Congress  said  go  to  it,  here’s 
a  rule,  proceed;  I  think  a  similar  pattern  could  well  unfold  here 
with the authority you mentioned. 

Senator DORGAN. All right. Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator  Dorgan. 
Hopefully  there  will  be  a  second  round  here.  I  want  to  ask  about 
the  drug  enforcement,  but  I  first  want  to  talk  about  one  of  the 
areas that this legislation would expand your authority in and you 
mentioned it, Commissioner Kovacic, and that would be in the area 
of the common carrier exemption. 

This  is  something  we’ve  been  talking  about  on  this  Committee. 
We  held  a  hearing  on  the  cell  phone  industry,  about  the  fact  that 
it started in its infancy with, you know, like the movie Wall Street 
with the big phone in a briefcase and now 200 million people have 
them,  yet  essentially  there  are  not  many  rules  that  the  cell  phone 
companies  have  to  follow.  The  two  main  things  that  we’ve  identi-
fied  as  issues  are  the  prorating  of  the  early  termination  fees  and 
how  that  works  and  some  of  the  advertisements  that  are  done  to 
entice  people  to  buy  and  then  they  find  they’re  locked  into  a  con-
tract. 

Then, the second thing is the, as I mentioned, advertisements of 
cell  phone  service  working,  fewest  dropped  calls,  all  those  kinds  of 
things, without really any back-up. 

Could  you  first  talk  about  how  many  complaints—do  you  get 
complaints  on  this,  even  though  you  don’t  have  authority?  Is  this 
an area that you’re interested in expanding into? 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  It  is,  Senator.  We  do  receive  some  complaints.  I 
don’t  have  a  rough  count  in  my  mind,  but  we’ll  certainly  supply 
that to you. 

We also see in a variety of other forms of work we do the concern 
about  advertising  in  the  telecommunications  sector.  I  would  say 
one  of  the  most  important  applications  of  the  adjustment  that  is 
contemplated  in  the  Reauthorization  Act  with  respect  to  common 
carriers is that we could bring the large body of experience and en-
forcement  capability  that  we  have  to  bear  on  advertising  issues  in 
this area and it’s not to slight other public agencies that have had 
a hand in this area. It’s simply that we feel in the area of national 
advertising,  and  regional  advertising,  we  handle  these  issues  well.

I think it’s fair to say when we observe the possibilities that might 
come  about  from  the  application  of  our  authority  in  this  area,  we 
think there would be large benefits to be had in establishing broad-
er national principles that we have applied in other sectors to over-
seeing this sector, too. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  and  I  suppose  one  of  the  arguments 

that’s made is the FTC has jurisdiction over this. 

go ahead. 

Could  you  just  give  me  some  examples  of  other  areas  where  you 
have  joint  jurisdiction  with  other  agencies  where  you  focus  on  the 
advertising and they focus on the substance of the regulation? 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  We  share  responsibility  with  the  FCC  in  the  area 
of  pretexting;  that  is,  we  have  overlapping  responsibility.  We  co-
operate very intensively on the Do Not Call List. 

I  realize,  and  you  probably  see  them  more  than  I  do,  there  are 
inherent  tensions  that  arise  at  any  time  that  two  Federal  institu-
tions  have  overlapping  responsibility.  At  the  same  time,  we’ve 
worked  very  hard  with  the  FCC  and  with  other  institutions  in 
which  that  circumstance  exists  to  develop  liaison  arrangements  to 
minimize  tensions  and  to  assure  that  we’re  not  tripping  over  each 
other when we’re operating in the same policy domain. 

So,  I  would  have  a  great  deal  of  confidence  that  those  types  of 
cooperative relationships would continue, they’d be intensified, and 
we’d  still  be  able  to  do  the  kind  of  work  that  we  think  we  do  par-
ticularly well. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Commissioner  Harbour,  are  you  concerned 
about  some  of  the  advertising  going  on  in  this  area  and  what 
you’ve heard? 

I  mean,  everyone  I  know  in  my  state  has  a  cell  phone  story.  So, 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  I’m  glad  you  asked  that,  Senator,  because  the 
Federal  Trade  Commission  will  be  hosting  a  town  hall  meeting  on 
May 6 and 7 of this year called Beyond Voice: Mapping the Mobile 
Marketplace,  where  we  will  explore  the  evolving  mobile  commerce 
marketplace—it’s  called  mCommerce  these  days,  and  see  how  that 
impacts consumer policy. 

So, we’ll have parties from all sides discussing this issue and we 

will likely issue a report thereafter. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Very good. 
Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  Let  me  just  add  that  we  have  some  overlapping 
jurisdiction with the bank regulators. We have overlapping jurisdic-
tion with the Antitrust Division, and we sometimes allocate indus-
try areas with them. 

But  getting  back  to  the  common  carrier  issue,  one  area,  and  it’s 
one  we’re  going  to  be  addressing  at  our  workshop,  that  we’re  be-
coming concerned about is cell phone spam and we believe we have 
jurisdiction either under the CAN–SPAM Act or under the FTC Act 
to  go  after  any  malefactors  there.  But  you  can  be  sure  that  if  we 
bring a case, the first defense they’re going to raise is the common 
carrier defense. 

They’ll  say,  ‘‘we’re  a  common  carrier,’’  and  it  will  take  us  6 
months  to  get  through  the  litigation  and  it  will  consume  a  lot  of 
resources for us to prove that they aren’t. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Right now, we have a big blown-up picture 
of an ad saying we can connect you to the world and the cell phone

service  doesn’t  work  there  or  people  are  told,  hey,  on  this  map 
you’re going to be—don’t worry, you’re going to get cell phone serv-
ice  there  and  then  they  don’t  and  then  they  can’t  even  terminate 
their  contract  without  having  to  pay  200  bucks  and  so  their  frus-
tration  is  that  there’s  really  no  one  minding  the  store  when  it 
comes to this right now. 

Is  this  something  where,  if  Senator  Dorgan’s  exemption  passed 
and the lifting of the exemption and we were able to get this done, 
that the FTC could look at? 

Mr. LEIBOWITZ. Yes. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
Senator DORGAN. Senator McCaskill? 

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’d  like  to  talk 

a little bit about credit cards. 

I firmly believe that credit cards are the next frontier of disaster 
as it relates to America’s economy and some of the abuses going on 
and I understand Section 5 and the authority, and I know that you 
have done a lengthy study on consumer protections in the mortgage 
industry  and  have  made  recommendations  to  other  financial  serv-
ices regulators and HUD about better consumer protections. 

We  have  had  a  number  of  hearings  on  credit  cards.  We’ve  had 
in  the  Permanent  Subcommittee  on  Investigations,  which  I  serve 
on,  and  we’ve  some  incredible  factual  information  that’s  come  to 
light about the credit card industry, and I think all of us have per-
sonal experiences that just make you want to wring someone’s neck 
in terms of some of the practices. 

I mean, one of my favorites is, Mr. Chairman, that some of these 
credit  cards  want  you  to  get  at  your  credit  limit  so  they  can  raise 
your interest rate and that’s one of the rationales they use for rais-
ing  your  interest  rate,  is  that  you’re  using  credit  at  or  near  the 
limit they have set for you. 

So, someone in my office had a personal experience with this and 
the irony is, is that the credit card company sent him a check made 
out for the amount it would take to get him to his credit limit. All 
he  had  to  do  was  sign  the  check,  bingo,  he’s  there  and  they  can 
raise the interest rate. 

I am curious if you have considered doing a similar study to the 
study  you  have  done  for  the  credit  card  industry  because  I  think 
the  abuses  that  are  in  the  credit  card  industry  and  the  practices 
that  are  being  used.  I  just  came  back  from  China  where  my  jaw 
dropped  when  I  learned  the  savings  rate  in  China  was  50  percent 
and the savings rate in our country is now net negative and a large 
amount of that is debt load. As we look at this subprime crisis and 
we  look  what  the  reality  is  of  consumers  and  what  they’re  doing 
out  there,  that  the  vast  majority  of  this  debt  is  being  held  in  very 
expensive  credit  card  debt  and  these  are  holes  that  the  American 
consumers  are  not  going  to  dig  out  of  if  they  are  doing  what  the 
credit card industry encourages them to do, which is minimum pay-
ment only. 

Could  you  all  speak  to  whether  or  not  you’ve  considered  doing  a 
long-term study about the effects of the credit card industry on the

35 

American  consumer  and  what  could  be  done  within  your  aegis  in 
terms of looking at those abuses? 

Uh-oh. I’m worried. Everybody’s looking at somebody else. 
Mr.  KOVACIC.  We  had  a  rough  division  of  labor  by  topic  before, 
Senator. So, we wanted to make sure that, much like the infielders 
racing for the fly ball, that we didn’t run over each other. 

I  would  say  we  don’t  have  a  specific  plan  in  place  to  do  this  at 
the  moment.  We’re  doing  quite  a  bit  of  research  on  financial  serv-
ices and lending, but I would be happy to speak with your staff and 
I’d be happy to meet with you to talk about what a research agen-
da in this area might look like. 

A  second  observation  is  that  this  is  an  area  and  maybe  a  topic 
for  a  fuller  discussion  another  day  where  we  do  bump  into  some 
substantial jurisdictional limits. 

The  credit  card  issuers,  we  can  examine,  and  those  whom  we 
prosecute  are  very  much  a  function  of  the  financial  services  statu-
tory  framework  that  we  have.  The  basic  distinction  is  whether  the 
issuer is a bank or is not a bank, I know that the Congress is pay-
ing  keen  attention  now  to  deciding  how  to  retool  and  reconfigure 
the  remarkable  legacy-based  financial  services  regulatory  scheme 
that was put in place 50–60–90 years ago and in many ways hasn’t 
been revisited. 

So  that’s  a  potential  limitation  on  what  we  do  here  as  well,  but 

I’d be delighted to meet with you—— 

Senator MCCASKILL. That would be terrific. 
Mr. KOVACIC.—to discuss this. 
Senator  MCCASKILL.  I  think  it’s  all  hands-on  deck  time  when  it 

comes to the credit card industry and what’s going on. 

Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  Yes,  and  let  me  just  add  to  what  the  Chairman 

said, too. 

We  do  have  a  major  investigation  going  on  of  a  subprime  credit 
card  issuer,  it’s  a  company  called  CompuCredit.  I’m  allowed  to 
make  that  public  because  the  company  made  it  public  in  its  SEC 
filings. If the Committee would like a briefing on that, we’re happy 
to provide it for you. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  you  would  allow  me  one 
more  question  because  I  have  to  run  back  to  the  Armed  Services 
hearing and I can’t stay for the second round. Do you mind? Do my 
colleagues mind? OK. Thank you very much. 

For  a  number  of  years,  we  have  encountered  problems  in  terms 
of  marketing  to  seniors.  I  have  sent  you  all  a  letter  about  the 
Craftmatic organization. I’ve not received a response from that yet, 
but there is incredible video footage of training going on in the area 
of  marketing  these  beds  to  seniors,  the  adjustable  beds.  There  is 
footage  of  the  trainers  teaching  the  salesmen,  for  gosh  sakes,  try 
to get them to cry and for God’s sakes, don’t let them talk to their 
loved ones, close the sale. It is incredibly—you know, it’s just sick-
ening  this  footage,  and  I’m  anxious  to  get  a  response  from  you 
about the investigation. This company has now changed names and 
problems. 

There’s  three  areas  I  want  to  address  and  then  I’ll  get  to  my 
question.  Then  there’s  reverse  mortgages  which  hopefully  we’re 
going to get an amendment on the bill we’re considering right now 
on the Floor as it relates to the marketing of reverse mortgages to

seniors. These are complicated and expensive financial tools and we 
have many instances—we had a hearing on this in the Aging Com-
mittee.  Many  instances  where  these  companies  are  marketing  de-
ferred  annuities  in  tandem  with  reverse  mortgage.  Now  that,  you 
know, takes chutzpah. That takes a lot of nerve. 

Then  we’ve  got  the  New  York  Times  article  that  was  published 
in  May  2007  where  they  documented  the  selling  of  lists  to  compa-
nies,  saying  these  guys  are  suckers,  these  are  old  people  that  are 
lonely,  you  know,  these  are  people  who  are  buying  lottery  tickets 
and  marketing  these  sales  lists.  In  other  words,  you  know,  we’ve 
got a good hot list of elderly people you can prey upon. 

What this all brings to mind is that I think we need a senior pro-
tection/senior  advocate  within  the  FTC  that  will  corral  the  many 
different  examples  of  where  the  elderly  are  particularly  being  vic-
timized by unfair and fraudulent trade practices and I would want 
to  work  closely  with  your  agency  in  working  on  legislation  that 
might  create  this  position  because  I  do  think  that  there  is  a  body 
of work that needs to be focused. 

If  we  going  to  prioritize  our  resources  and  prioritize  what  the 
FTC  is  doing,  I  could  make  a  strong  argument  that  that 
prioritization should begin with the bilking of the elderly and prac-
tices  that  are  used  against  a  vulnerable  population  where  people 
are aware that these sometimes are people that don’t have a lot of 
family  around  and  want  someone  to  talk  to  and  if  you  can  gain 
their confidence on one front, then you can do some things that are 
pretty outrageous. 

I  would  appreciate  your  comments  on  your  willingness  to  work 
with us in trying to create a senior protection/senior advocate with-
in the FTC as part of this FTC reauthorization. 

Mr. LEIBOWITZ. Well, I think we need to take a look at your pro-
posal,  but  we’re  absolutely  willing  to  work  with  you,  Members  of 
this  Committee,  Senator  Kohl,  Members  of  the  Aging  Committee. 
Absolutely.  We’re  aware  of  the  legislation  that’s  pending  on  the 
Floor. 

Just  going  back  to  Craftmatic,  which  was  the  first  topic  you 
raised,  we  are  well  aware  of  Craftmatic.  Craftmatic  is  very  well 
aware  of  us  because  we  fined  them  over  a  million  dollars  for  Do 
Not  Call  violations  last  year;  $4.5  million,  actually.  It  was  a  sub-
stantial fine and so we’re aware of your letter. We will get back to 
you on that. 

Senator  MCCASKILL.  Yes.  Because  this  goes  way  farther  than  a 
phone  call.  I  mean,  this  man  couldn’t  read.  I  mean,  he  can’t  see 
and  he  signed—she  guided  his  hand  on  the  paper  and  this  is  all 
documented.  They  sent  in  a  hidden  camera  into  this  training  ses-
sion.  I  mean,  it  is—as  a  former  prosecutor,  it  looks  like  to  me  it’s 
a slam dunk. 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Well,  Senator,  could  I  offer  one  additional  possi-
bility  that  I  think  matches  some  of  your  own  concerns  here?  One 
thing that we’ve spent a great deal of time doing in our Fraud Pro-
gram is to identify specific patterns and this often involves working 
with  criminal  prosecutors  and  with  our  state  counterparts  to  iden-
tify the specific patterns of behavior that you mentioned, especially 
the  development  among  the  serious,  in  many  instances,  serious

criminals  who  use  these  techniques  to  develop  lists  and  sell  lists 
of individuals who might be particularly vulnerable. 

One  thing  I  would  like  to  do  in  cooperation  with  my  colleagues 
is  to  take  a  number  of  the  things  that  we  do  that  deal  with  the 
economically  disadvantaged  and  deal  with  specific  vulnerabilities 
that  often  are  the  consequence  either  of  language  asymmetries, 
poverty, other conditions, where we have programs now and to pro-
vide  perhaps  a  more  specific  focus  on  them.  I  would  like  to  take 
what we’ve learned in selected areas and apply them perhaps here 
as well. 

This is another topic I would be glad to speak with you and your 

staff about. 

Senator MCCASKILL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. 
Senator DORGAN. Thank you. Senator Cantwell. 

STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It’s  great  to  see 
the Commissioners here to talk about what I think is a very impor-
tant  issue  impacting  our  economy  today  and  that’s  the  high  price 
of fuel. 

In  my  state,  both  gasoline  and  diesel  are  in  some  parts  already 
over $4 per gallon and I know that you made mention in your testi-
mony  to  the  new  authority  that  has  been  given  to  the  FTC,  but  I 
kind  of  sense  it  was  passing  focus,  and  what  I  really  want  to  get 
at  today  in  my  questions  is  the  point  to  which  work  will  move 
much—I  mean  that  the  FTC  will  move  much  more  quickly  on  an 
expedited rulemaking. 

The  reason  I  say  this  is  because  this  is  authority  to  help  basi-
cally  protect  consumers  from  market  manipulation  and  it  is  new 
authority,  but  we  have  been  very  successful  with  the  SEC  having 
this  kind  of  authority  to  help  on  markets  and  in  the  2005  Energy 
bill,  we  gave  FERC  similar  authority  to  what  we  are  giving  to  the 
FTC. 

It  took  them  6  months  to  get  the  rulemaking  for  that  rule  and 
to  date,  FERC  has  used  that  expanded  authority  for  64  investiga-
tions,  14  of  which  have  resulted  in  settlements.  This  is  basically 
just  on  their  technical  and  existing  authority,  and  they  basically 
were settlements for over $48 million in various civil penalties. 

In  addition,  within  18  months  of  their  rulemaking,  FERC 
brought  two  major  enforcement  cases  for  market  manipulation 
under  their  new  authority  which  may  total  over  $458  million  in 
civil penalties. 

So,  my  question  is,  is  the  FTC  going  to  act  as  expeditiously  as 
FERC did in taking this new authority to protect consumers in the 
area of market manipulation of gas prices and come up with a new 
rule? 

In  fact,  what  I’m  really  asking  is  whether  you  are  going  to  be 

able to complete that rulemaking by the end of this year? 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Could  I  take  a  try  at  the  question,  Senator,  and 

lay out for you what we see to be a way ahead on this issue? 

The  first  thing  we’re  doing,  we  do  have  an  internal  working 
group  that’s  working  on  precisely  this  issue.  Among  the  things 
we’re  trying  to  do  and  have  been  working  on  is  to  make  sure  that 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75166.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

38 

we  learn  from  precisely  the  experiences  of  the  other  authorities 
whom  you’ve  mentioned,  CFTC,  FERC,  all  of  the  others  who’ve 
been  dealing  with  manipulation-like  authority  in  the  energy  area. 
That’s going to inform our discussions. 

We’re also contemplating a process of public consultation because 
there  are  a  number  of  thoughtful  experts  on  the  outside  who  have 
some very useful views, I think, about how this authority could be 
applied to help us make sure that in developing our authority that 
we  don’t  simply  take  an  off-the-rack  solution  from  FERC  or  the 
CFTC  that  might  not  fit  our  own  needs  well.  We  want  to  consider 
making what adaptations they think are appropriate. 

We  have  people  who  spend  a  lot  of  time  looking  on  the  outside 
at exactly the experience you’ve mentioned, so we think we can do 
a  bit  of  learning  about  how  that’s  gone,  and  my  prediction  would 
be that there will be an advanced notice of a rulemaking this year. 
I  don’t  have  a  specific  time  table  for  you,  but  we  are  developing 
this and we’re working on this quite quickly. This is a high priority 
for us. This is something that I would be quite willing, in addition 
to this hearing, to discuss with you. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  I  don’t  understand  what  you  mean  by  if  it’s 
a  high  priority.  Can  you  commit  to  having  a  rule  done  by  the  end 
of the year? If it’s a high priority and consumers are obviously anx-
ious—we  just  had  a  hearing,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  you  attended  in 
another  Committee  on  looking  at  the  lack  of  transparency  in  in-
vestments,  particularly  from  the  various  financial  institutions  in 
these  markets,  and  we  came  to  the  conclusion  that  nobody  could 
predict  anything  about  prices  because  there  wasn’t  enough  infor-
mation that’s readily available. 

So,  the  authority  given  to  FERC—to  FTC,  sorry,  FERC  already 
has this authority, but to FTC is critically important to be the reg-
ulator  in  the  market,  and  if  your  analogy—I’m  a  big  baseball  fan. 
You  know,  your  analogy  about  running  into  each  other,  I  don’t 
think  you’ve  fielded  a  team.  We  need  you  to  field  a  team  of  inves-
tigators  that  are  going  to  go  after  this  issue  of  market  manipula-
tion and we can’t wait until $4.50, at least in my area. 

Ms. HARBOUR. I guess the tension here, Senator, is that a poorly 
drafted  rule  could  have  adverse  effects  on  gas  prices  and  con-
sumers. So, if it’s done, it has to be done correctly and so—— 

Senator  CANTWELL.  That’s  why  I’m  giving  you  what  FERC  has 
done.  FERC  did  it  in  6  months  and  their  authority  so  far  has 
stopped  basically  settlement  cases  in  the  millions  and  in  some 
cases civil penalties might be in the hundreds of millions. 

So,  this  is  about  saying  that  you  will  have  a  policeman  on  the 
beat,  that  somebody  in  the  Federal  Government  is  taking  the  oil 
markets  and  making  sure  that  consumers  are  protected  against 
market manipulation. 

We’ve  already  done  that  in  the  natural  gas  markets  and  elec-
tricity  markets  post-Enron  and  guess  what?  The  new  authority 
that  FERC  is  using  seems  to  be  producing  good  results.  So,  I’d  be 
more  than  thrilled  if  you’d  beat  FERC  with  coming  up  with  a  new 
rule within 6 months. 

Mr. KOVACIC. Senator, let me—— 
Senator  CANTWELL.  But  I’ll  give  you  6  months  as  well.  I  agree, 
you  need  to  do  it  right,  but  the  urgency,  I  think,  would  be  to  say

that  that’s  your  intention,  to  try  to  get  it  completed  by  the  end  of 
the year, given the extreme nature of what’s happening in the mar-
kets today. 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Senator,  I’d  say  we  have  a  good  team,  a  great 
team,  none  better.  I’d  add  that,  in  addition  to  the  new  authority, 
they’re on the field every day with respect to the existing authority 
we  have  to  identify  misconduct  that  would  violate  the  antitrust 
laws and they’re very busy on that front, too. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  These  are  not  antitrust  issues.  That’s  the 
whole  problem.  The  new  authority  was  given  to  you  because  it 
doesn’t have anything to do with antitrust. It is not people coming 
together  colluding  about  prices.  It  is  about  transparency  in  the 
market and moving supply. 

I’m  just  again  bringing  it  up,  Mr.  Chairman,  because  our  state 
has  asked  the  FTC  for  a  longer  investigation.  Spokane,  Wash-
ington,  had  the  highest  gas  prices  in  the  Nation  and  no  one  could 
say  why.  In  fact,  your  initial  investigation  showed  an  anomaly  in 
the  marketplace  but  still  couldn’t  understand  what  the  anomaly 
was about and that’s why you’re doing a larger investigation. 

Mr. KOVACIC. Yes. 
Senator CANTWELL. So, my point is that this is new authority to 
get around what has been years and years of saying that this issue 
is about antitrust. It is not. It is about whether someone is manipu-
lating  supply,  not  shortage  of  supply  for  natural  reasons  but  ma-
nipulation  of  supply,  and  we  had  a  101  case  in  this  as  it  related 
to electricity in the West Coast and we certainly don’t want to have 
another one of these cases as it relates to oil. 

Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  Senator  Cantwell,  if  I  can  just  add,  as  someone 
who supported your provision, including the price gouging provision 
that  I  think  was  removed  in  conference,  we  start  many  of  our 
rulemakings  with  an  ANPR,  advance  notice  of  proposed  rule-
making, so I actually think this is a pretty meaningful commitment 
to start the ball rolling here and to look at the manipulation provi-
sion and move it toward a rule. 

Senator CANTWELL. I thank you for that statement. I’m bringing 
this  up  because  you  didn’t  ask  for  this  authority.  This  Committee 
initiated the legislation and passed it as part of the Energy bill. 

So,  we  want  to  make  sure  you  are  going  to  implement  the  rule 

and that you’re going to do it aggressively. 

Mr. KOVACIC. Senator, I’m delighted, in addition to this hearing, 

to consult with you and all you need do is ask me—— 

Senator CANTWELL. Great. 
Mr. KOVACIC.—about what we’re doing. 
Senator CANTWELL. Well, I will be sending a letter along with my 
colleague,  Senator  Dorgan,  today  asking  you  to  expedite  the  rule 
and have it completed by the end of the year. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator DORGAN. Thank you. Senator Snowe. 

STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE 

Senator  SNOWE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  hold-
ing  this  timely  hearing  on  an  array  of  issues  that  certainly  affect 
consumers,  from  subprime  lending  and  the  deceptive  practices  by

non-bank  lenders,  of  course,  to  energy  speculation  as  well  as  to 
identity  theft,  and  so  the  FTC  certainly  is  on  the  frontline  in  so 
many issues that are crucial and central to the consumers in Amer-
ica. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Chairman  Kovacic,  I  want  to  follow  up  on  some 
of  the  questions  regarding  energy  speculation  and  futures  specula-
tion  within  the  energy  market  because  certainly  that  has  been  a 
fundamental  underpinning  of  some  of  the  reasons  as  to  why  in-
creases in energy prices have skyrocketed. 

Why  hasn’t  the  FTC  issued  regulations  since  you’ve  had  the  re-
quirement  to  do  so  since  December  when  this  legislation  became 
law? Even in your FTC report of 2007, it doesn’t even acknowledge 
that futures speculation could be a contributing factor to the rising 
prices  in  energy,  and  frankly,  you  know,  this  is  not  just  hearsay 
or hypothetical. 

There  have  been  two  different  studies  that  have  been  issued  by 
the  Permanent  Subcommittee  on  Investigations  of  the  Homeland 
Security  and  Governmental  Affairs  Committee  that  underscored 
this last year, that it can add $20 to $25 per barrel of oil in terms 
of futures speculation. 

So,  why  hasn’t  the  FTC  pursued  an  aggressive  approach  and 
strategy  with  respect  to  this  issue  that  seemingly  can  have  a  pro-
found  impact?  I  mean,  the  prices  have  increased  since  December 
with  respect  to  oil  and  gasoline  more  than  20  percent  and  as  we 
know,  trucking  companies  and  independent  truckers  are  at  a 
standstill across America. I mean diesel has gone beyond $4 a gal-
lon. 

In  my  State  of  Maine,  $3.78  for  a  gallon  of  oil,  I  mean,  is  just 
absolutely  prohibitive  and  so  we’ve  got  to  take  every  stance  pos-
sible  and  pursue  every  measure  possible  as  to  what  could  be  pos-
sibly  contributing  to  these  price  increases  and  the  fact  is,  many 
have  indicated  it’s  just  not  supply  and  demand  that’s  been  the  in-
stigator driving up these prices, but in fact it is futures speculation 
that has risen by more than 850 percent since 2001. 

So, can you tell me, you know, exactly what the FTC is doing be-
cause  I’m  not  sure  that  I  was  clear  in  your  response  to  Senator 
Cantwell’s  question  because  you’re  in  a  position  to  issue  regula-
tions  on  this  question.  You  didn’t  even  acknowledge  it  in  the  2007 
FTC report that it could be a responsible factor for driving up these 
energy prices. 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  The  authority  in  question,  of  course,  is  relatively 
new and I think you might sense from my response and that of my 
colleagues that we’re going to work as actively as we can to under-
take the process that could lead to a rule. 

I’d also say that in many instances, I don’t know of another insti-
tution within the Federal Government that has spent more time in 
the  past  10  years  looking  at  these  types  of  questions.  I  would  say 
that with respect to futures markets and with respect to the aspect 
of  speculation,  a  consequence  of  the  jurisdictional  boundaries  that 
we’ve  had  is  that’s  principally  been  an  issue  and  a  set  of  concerns 
devoted to other agencies. I think one thing that all of us are com-
mitted  to  do  in  this  instance,  in  the  process  of  developing  perhaps 
a rule in this area is to make sure that the separate public institu-
tions—I’m  thinking  about  FERC:  I’m  thinking  about  the  CFTC  in 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75166.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

particular—that  instead  of  having  individual  effort  in  these  areas, 
have  a  deeper  collaboration,  so  that  as  we  undertake  the  process 
that’s now possible under the new authority, our focus will be more 
intensely directed at precisely this kind of behavior. 

Senator SNOWE. Well, to that point, Senator Feinstein and I have 
introduced  legislation  that  passed  the  Senate  unanimously  as  an 
amendment  to  the  Farm  bill  that’s  pending  in  conference  to  pro-
vide, you know, the CFTC with the appropriate oversight of futures 
speculation, I mean oil futures speculation. 

In fact, the CFTC reversed its position last Fall and unanimously 
requested  that  oversight  authority  because  it  is  so  crucial  to  this 
issue,  but  irrespective  of  that,  and  hopefully  it  will  get  done,  I 
frankly  would  like  to  have  it  pulled  out  of  the  Farm  bill  and  just, 
you know, advance on its own and go to the President for signature 
so we can address that question right now and the CFTC have the 
oversight  for  transparency  and  accountability  where  the  various 
mechanisms  now  evade  the  oversight  by  the  CFTC,  whether  it’s 
Internet  transactions,  over-the-counter  transactions,  or 
inter-
national transactions. 

But be that as it may, you have in the FTC within your purview 
to  oversee  both  consumer  prices  and  futures  prices.  So,  while  the 
CFTC  does  have  responsibility,  no  question,  in  its  oversight,  you 
have the ability to look at the macro picture and the totality of the 
picture  in  terms  of  the  impact  on  those  prices  and  particularly  on 
consumers. 

So,  I  would  ask  you  to  adopt  a  sense  of  urgency  with  regard  to 
this  issue  because  people  are  suffering  mightily  under  the  weight 
of  these  price  increases  and  we  need  to  know  why.  We  need  to 
know  why,  what  is  driving  up  these  prices,  if  isn’t  supply  and  de-
mand. 

So, I would urge you to do so because I think it is extremely crit-

ical. 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Yes,  Senator,  I  understand  that  very  clearly  and 
I see part of our responsibility here. In addition to addressing spe-
cific  issues  that  arise  in  this  area,  we  need  to  draw  attention  and 
stimulate  debate  about  all  of  the  forces  that  affect  the  pricing  and 
supply of energy as we see it today. I think that is an indispensable 
and  critical  ingredient  of  what  we  can  do.  As  we  identify  the 
strengths  and  weaknesses  of  different  policy  tools  at  our  disposal, 
we  need  to  consider  the  effect  of  these  price  developments  that 
you’ve  mentioned.  So,  I  see  this  as  being  a  critical  part  of  our  re-
sponsibility. 

Senator SNOWE. I appreciate that. Thank you. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Senator  Snowe,  thank  you  very  much.  Mr. 
Chairman,  let  me  ask  you  with  respect  to  this  issue  of  the  futures 
market  driving  up  the  price  of  oil  well  beyond  where  supply  and 
demand would have it, the top analysts from Oppenheimer & Com-
pany says this is like a 24/7 casino, open 24 hours a day. 

You know, we had testimony from a couple of experts in front of 
the  Senate  Energy  Committee  saying  that  what  is  happening  is 
that  the  futures  market  has  now  included  substantial  speculation 
by  hedge  funds  and  investment  banks.  Investment  banks  for  the 
first  time  are  actually  buying  oil  storage  capacity  in  order  to  buy

oil,  take  it  off  the  market  and  then  sell  it  later  when  oil  is  more 
valuable. 

I  mean,  what  kind  of  jurisdiction  do  you  have,  what  kind  of  au-

thority would the FTC have to be taking a look at that? 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  I  would  say  up  to  this  point,  we  do  have  a  broad 
charter  that  Congress  has  given  us  to  do  economic  studies  and  re-
search,  and  energy  is  certainly  an  area  in  which  we’ve  exercised 
that. 

I would say as a matter of custom, questions related to commod-
ities  trading  and  the  operation  of  the  commodities  market  has  re-
ceived  some  attention  from  us,  but  because  of,  in  effect,  the  rough 
distribution  of  authority  that  we  have  across  the  agencies  that  do 
this  work,  that  is  a  responsibility  that’s  principally  been  in  the 
portfolio of another institution, the CFTC, but I would certainly ex-
pect  as  a  consequence  of  the  authority  that’s  contained  in  the 
measure  that  Senator  Cantwell  was  instrumental  in  having  this 
body  adopt,  that  that’s  inevitably,  immediately  going  to  become  a 
more intense area of concern for us. 

One  of  the  things  that  the  internal  group  we  have,  which  has 
been  working  for  some  time  on  the  measure  in  question  in  the 
roughly  3  months  or  so  since  the  authority  was  given  us,  is  to  de-
velop  a  much  closer  relationship  with  the  other  Federal  regulators 
who do exactly this work. 

Part  of  what  I  would  anticipate  as  part  of  that  process  is  that 
we  create  a  greater  degree  of  what  I  suppose  could  be  interoper-
ability  so  that  we  have  greater  direct  and  continuing  access  to  the 
research they’ve already done. 

Part  of  what  we’re  seeking  to  achieve  here,  that  is,  in  learning 
more  about  this  dimension  of  the  issue,  is  that  we  take  the  fullest 
possible  advantage  of  work  that  our  counterpart  agencies  have 
done. 

So,  I  would  say  it  has  been  a  modest  part  of  our  responsibility 
to date but a major focus of the work we’re doing internally in the 
run-up  to  proceedings  in  this  area  is  to  make  sure  that  we  learn 
in a meaningful way what our counterpart agency has done in this 
area. 

Senator DORGAN. Yes, I would say, though, that your counterpart 
agency  can’t  see  what  doesn’t  exist  and  what  doesn’t  exist  is  that 
which  is  unregulated,  behind  the  curtain,  on  the  intercontinental 
exchanges and so on. 

It’s  why  a  32-year-old  was  able  to  control,  what  was  it,  70  per-
cent  of  the—was  it  natural  gas?  So,  my  point  is,  I  wouldn’t  worry 
too much about your relationship with others and waiting for some-
one  to  do  something.  If  somebody  else  is  not  doing  it,  not  able  to 
do  it,  I’d  jump  right  in  with  both  feet  and  start  investigating  and 
use all the authorities that you have. 

There’s  something  going  on  here  that’s  wrong.  I  started  this 
morning  by  talking  about  the  substantial  bail-out  to  the  tune  of 
tens  of  billions  of  dollars  of  institutions  that  are  now  adjudged  to 
be  too  big  to  fail.  If  they’re  too  big  to  fail,  they  are  not  too  small 
to  regulate,  it  seems  to  me,  and  whether  it’s  hedge  funds,  invest-
ment  banks,  or  whoever  is  engaged  in  these  markets  in  very  sub-
stantial  amounts  of  speculation,  I  hope  you’ll  use  all  the  authority 
that you have and that this committee wants to give you in a way

that  is  not  overly  deferential  to  other  agencies  that  may  not  be 
doing anything. 

Mr. KOVACIC. Senator, I don’t think you’ll find any hesitation on 
the part of myself and my colleagues to exert ourselves vigorously, 
in particular where we may share responsibility with another insti-
tution  that  is  less  vigorous  in  doing  so.  So,  there’s  no  hesitation 
there. 

My  observation,  in  exercising  that  responsibility,  is  that  I  would 
like to see us do two things. Where there has been good work done 
that  can  form  our  own  proceedings,  I’d  like  to  have  the  benefit  of 
that.  In  particular,  to  think  of  Senator  Cantwell’s  point  again  for 
a  moment,  where  there  has  been  experience,  and  we  look  forward 
to learning more about this experience, where there has been more 
experience  with  actual  implementation,  I  expect  that  you  would 
agree  with  me  it  would  be  foolish  for  us  as  we  proceed  again  in  a 
fast-paced  way  not  to  make  sure  that  we  have  the  benefit  of  that 
so that they can tell us—— 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, I agree with that. 
Mr.  KOVACIC.  So,  and  the  last  piece  of  it  is  there  are  a  number 
of  very  wise  outsiders  who  have  been  following  exactly  these 
trends. Some of them have been witnesses before your Committees. 
We’d like to talk to them some more as well. 

Senator DORGAN. I don’t disagree with you. I would say, though, 
that  I  don’t  know  of  a  case  where  someone  has  effectively  accused 
a  Federal  agency  of  speeding  recently.  Whether  it’s  the  FTC  or  a 
dozen  other  regulatory  agencies,  our  frustration  is,  I  showed  you 
what  I  put  up  on  the  chart,  on  the  board  today,  that  even  today 
you  can  go  to  the  Internet  and  see  unbelievably  deceptive  adver-
tising trying to reach out and victimize another homeowner. 

I  just  would  say  that  we  have  written  a  piece  of  legislation  that 
gives  you  in  my  judgment  much  needed  new  authority.  Our  pur-
pose  in  doing  that  is  to  hope  that  you  will  be  aggressive  in  using 
that authority at a time when we are surrounded by a whole series 
of  practices  that  is  now  costing  our  country  and  our  government  a 
massive amount of dollars to try to clean up the mess. 

Mr. KOVACIC. I would say, all I could say is that I know of a few 
Federal  judges  who  have  given  us  tickets  for  speeding  and  have 
told  us  to  turn  over  our  license  in  specific  cases,  but  I  specifically 
and completely understand the urgency of the message you give us 
today. 

Senator DORGAN. Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  want  to  now  ex-
plore this issue of regulation of some of the conduct of the pharma-
ceutical  industry  and  part  of  me  wants  to  know  if  the  legislation 
that’s  proposed  will  help  at  all  in  this  area  and  then  also  just  to 
explore,  as  someone  who’s  new  to  the  Senate,  what  we  can  do  to 
try  to  get  at  this  problem  because  I  just  want  to  help  some  babies 
in  my  state  and  some  doctors  in  my  state  that  want  to  do  their 
jobs. 

As  I  mentioned,  there  is  a  drug  and  I  have  it  here  called  ‘‘intra-
venous  indomethacin,’’  and  it’s  used  to  treat  a  disorder  called  Pat-
ent Ductus Arteriosus, which is known as PDA and it’s a rare dis-
order  that  prevents  holes  from  healing  in  the  hearts  of  premature 
infants  and  they  used  to  use  surgery  to  do  this.  Since  the  1970s, 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  07:49 Jul 24, 2012 Jkt 052754 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\75166.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

44 

this drug has been proven as a commonly used method for treating 
this problem and it actually is cost effective and works. 

Well,  Merck  produced  this  drug  and  2  years  ago  Ovation  Phar-
maceuticals  acquired  the  rights.  The  company  quickly  increased 
the  price  more  than  18  times.  So,  this  used  to  sell  for  a  $100  and 
then just in a matter of a few months it went up to $1,875 for three 
one milligram units of the drug. 

Now  even  though  this  is  an  American  company,  the  price  that 
this company charges in the United States is 44 times higher than 
what  they  sell  it  for  in  Canada.  Nothing  can  justify  this  kind  of 
price disparity as far as I’m concerned. 

I  also  want  to  point  out  that  nothing  was  changed  in  this  drug 
when  they  acquired  it,  yet  they  increased  it  18  times.  Now  there’s 
no  generic  equivalent  of  this  drug  on  the  market  and  there’s  only 
one  other  drug  that’s  approved  by  the  FDA  to  treat  this  problem 
and  as  it  happens,  Ovation  is  also  the  source  of  that  drug  in  the 
United  States  and  not  surprisingly,  the  price  that  it  charges  for 
this  medicine  is  nearly  identical  to  what  it  charges  for  this  medi-
cine. 

So you have a price that’s 44 times higher than Canada and that 
went  up  in  just  a  few  months  18  times  what  it  was  originally  and 
is  the  price  that  they  charge  for  the  other  drug,  and  to  me  this 
looks  like  price  gouging  and  exploiting  vulnerable  babies  and  a 
healthcare system that’s already taxed to the maximum. 

So,  what  I  want  to  know  and  we  wrote  a  letter  to  this  company 
May  7.  We’ve  been  in  some  communication  with  them  and  we  will 
continue  to  do  that.  My  guess  is  that  this  will  end  up  on  your 
desks.  What  I  want  to  know  is  has  the  FTC  conducted  investiga-
tions of problems that are similar to this? 

I  know,  Commissioner  Harbour,  you  mentioned  the  current  in-
vestigation that’s going on with payments made to keep generics off 
the market. This is obviously, as far as we know, a different situa-
tion,  but  are  there  investigations  that  are  similar  to  these  and 
what has the outcome been? 

Senator  DORGAN.  Senator  Klobuchar,  would  you  hold  on  that?  I 
wanted  to  point  out  that  I  have  to  depart  and  Senator  Cantwell 
will chair the remainder of this hearing. 

I want to thank the Commissioners. I’m sorry I interrupted your

question, but—— 

That’s fine. 

Senator  DORGAN.  I  think  perhaps  the  more  dramatic  moment 

will come in their answer. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Very good. 
Senator DORGAN. But I thank Senator Cantwell for being well to 

chair the meeting. 

Mr. KOVACIC. May I thank you, Chairman Dorgan, for the chance 

again to discuss your proposals today? Thank you. 

Senator DORGAN. Thank you. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.  Senator  Klobuchar,  we  are  very  aware  of  your

investigate this price increase. 

In a public setting, we are not in a position to confirm, you know, 

or deny the existence of any such investigation——

Senator KLOBUCHAR. I understand. 
Ms.  HARBOUR.—but  we  do  share  the  concerns  of  rapidly  rising 
pharmaceutical prices and we will continue to be very, very vigilant 
in  our  enforcement.  It  is  a  common  goal  of  ours  to  detect  and  stop 
these types of anticompetitive practices in this industry. 

My colleague, Commissioner Leibowitz, has been on the forefront 
of  working  with  Congress  on  legislation  and  I’m  going  to  let  him 
talk about some of our current initiatives. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Excellent.  If  you  could  maybe,  Commis-
sioner  Leibowitz,  also  if  there’s  examples  of  other  cases  from  the 
past  that  you  have.  Being  new  at  this,  I’d  just  like  to  know  the 
path that this could go. 

Mr. LEIBOWITZ. Well, we spend a lot of our time looking at phar-
maceutical  competition  at  our  agency.  We  review  many  pharma-
ceutical  mergers  and  one  of  our  biggest  initiatives  on  the  ‘‘conduct 
side’’  is  to  try  to  stop  these  pay-for-delay  settlements,  where  a 
brand  pays  the  generic  competitor  to  stay  out  of  the  market  and 
consumers  are  left  holding  the  bag  or  footing  the  bill,  and  there’s 
legislation introduced by Senators Kohl, Grassley, Leahy and Schu-
mer on that. 

As  for  a  legislative  approach  to  this,  why  don’t  we  take  a  look 
at  it  in  a  little  more  detail  and  get  back  to  you  and  see  where  we 
need to go and whether legislation is necessary? 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Well,  as  far  as  legislation,  I’m  curious  if— 
and  we’re  waiting  to  talk  to  the  company  about  this,  but  I’m  just 
wondering  what  you  would  do  with  this  if  this  came  your  way. 
What’s the course? How long would it take? I’m trying to help these 
people in my state. 

Mr. LEIBOWITZ. So, look, obviously this is a real problem and it’s 
a drug that is only needed by a few people. They seem to have—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Babies. 
Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.—raised  the  price,  some  would  say  unconscion-
ably,  and  the  disparity  between  the  United  States  and  Canada  is, 
it’s  not  a  legal  term  but  it  seems  appalling,  and  I  understand  why 
your  constituents  and  probably  people  in  other  states  are  enor-
mously concerned about this. 

When  you’re  dealing  with  unilateral  conduct  by  a  company,  it’s 
more  complicated  than  if  they  were  to  sit  in  a  smoke-filled  room 
and  conspire  to  fix  prices.  Investigations  are  very  labor  intensive. 
There are many things that I happen to like about the reauthor-
ization—but  one  of  the  areas  where  we  are  actually  adding  people 
is  in  our  healthcare  shop.  We  want  to  add  more.  The  reauthoriza-
tion would grow our agency considerably over a period of years. 

I know that doesn’t reach this particular circumstance, but it will 
help us when we have sufficient number of personnel and good at-
torneys—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Just so—again—— 
Mr. LEIBOWITZ. It will help to stop these types of problems. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Right. I’m not on some crusade against you 

on this. 

Mr. LEIBOWITZ. I know, I know. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. I’m on a crusade to fix this. 
Mr. LEIBOWITZ. You’ve always been very friendly.

nesota. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  I  want  to  know  what  would  happen.  We 
write  a  letter  and  we  say  this  isn’t  fair,  it’s  wrong,  so  then  it  goes 
into one of your rulemakings, and does the legislation change that? 
Is  it  going  to  take  9  years  or,  you  know,  what  would  happen?  Not 
rulemaking. I apologize. But investigation. 

What would happen and how long could it take? 
Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  Investigations  could  take,  and  usually  do  take  a 
period  of  months.  I  think  we  would  first—and  we  may  be  doing 
this—look  at  the  issue  generally  and  look  specifically  at  this  par-
ticular case, but again we can’t talk in much detail—— 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. I don’t want you to talk about this. I under-

stand that as a lawyer. 
Mr. LEIBOWITZ. Sure. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. I just need generally what’s happened. 
Mr. LEIBOWITZ. We’ll get back to you on this question. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  So  I  can  go  tell  the  doctors  back  in  Min-

Ms.  HARBOUR.  I’m  not  speaking  about  this  particular  case,  but 
in  general,  if  this  type  of  drug  was  a  biologic,  one  that’s  made  by 
a more natural process, perhaps a generic drug could emerge which 
would  exert  some  sort  of  competitive  pressure,  but  not  specifically 
talking about this case, those are some of the things that we would 
look  at  as  an  agency.  But  this  is  an  important  issue  and  certainly 
this is something that is on our radar screen. 

Mr.  ROSCH.  Let  me  just  say  one  thing  about  this,  if  I  may,  Sen-
ator, and that is, that this is very fact intensive. We have actually 
litigated  in  the  11th  Circuit  and  lost  a  very  important  case  where 
the  11th  Circuit  held  that  if  and  to  the  extent  that  a  biologic  or 
a medicine is covered by a patent, then the patentholder, by virtue 
of  the  patent  laws,  is  able  to  do  just  about  anything  they  want  to 
do. 

So, frankly again, we’ve litigated this and we lost it. We tried to 
take it to the Supreme Court. We were unsuccessful in getting the 
Supreme  Court  to  review  it.  So,  the  first  issue  that  will  arise  in 
any of these cases is going to be whether or not it is patented and 
I don’t know at this point what the avenue is in the case you have 
mentioned,  I  have  not  a  clue,  but  I  don’t  want  to  overpromise  as 
to  what  we  can  do,  consistent  at  least,  with  the  11th  Circuit  opin-
ion. 

Now  frankly,  we  don’t  think  they’re  right,  but  at  the  present 

time, that’s the law. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  All  right.  Well,  that’s  very  helpful  and  we 
will continue. I’m sure you’ll hear from us on this case and it would 
be nice if there was a generic to have some competition going with 
this  area,  but  what  I’m  most  interested  in  is  this  action  that  hap-
pened  where  it  went  up  18  times  and  the  fact  that,  you  know,  we 
can refer it, again I don’t want to get into the specifics of this. 

Usually  you  say  OK,  there’s  a  criminal  violation,  you  refer  it.  It 
gets charged this way, it takes this long to go through the process, 
and  these  are  the  potential  outcomes.  So  that’s  what  I’m  trying  to 
figure out with something that to me seems outrageous. 

What  do  I  do  with  it,  and  how  do  I  get  some  action,  and  if  it’s 

not the FTC, then maybe we need legislation. 

OK. Thank you.

Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Senator  Klobuchar.  Mr.  Chair-
man Kovacic, I’m sorry, Kovacic, not to continue to talk about this 
issue, but I just want to explain one thing to make sure that we’re 
clear and then ask you all another question about DTV. 

On  the  market  manipulation  question,  we’re  not—it’s  not  con-
fusing  authority  that  we’re  giving  to  the  FTC  that  is  as  it  relates 
to  other  agencies.  The  CFTC  authority  is  very  clear.  It’s  in  the  fu-
tures market. So, they look at futures commodities and—— 

Mr. KOVACIC. Yes. 
Senator  CANTWELL.—and  that’s  why  Senator  Snowe’s  good  work 
with  Senator  Feinstein  is  trying  to  close  a  loophole  in  the  futures 
market  as  it  relates  to  online  trading  and  particularly  ICE  which 
is—— 

Mr. KOVACIC. Yes. 
Senator  CANTWELL.—a  very  big  part  of  the  trading  futures  mar-
ket  for  oil  that’s  basically  not  regulated  in  the  United  States,  you 
might have some insight into it, but it’s not an enforceable market 
mechanism  by  the  CFTC.  So  that’s  a  good  idea  to  close  a  loophole 
in the futures market. 

The  FERC,  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  has  the 
ability  in  physical  markets  to  investigate  market  manipulation  of 
wholesale  electricity  and  natural  gas  and  as  I  said,  that  authority 
was  given  to  them  in  2005  and  has  worked  very  well  in  stopping 
the  market  from  activities  that  they  might  have  thought  were  OK 
to pursue. 

In the grand scheme of Enron, we saw where somebody got very 
elaborate  about  what  they  thought  they  could  do  in  the  physical 
market and certainly if you listen to the testimony of many of those 
individuals  in  court  cases,  they  thought  they  had  the  authority  to 
do  so.  They  literally  thought  that  their  perpetration  of  schemes,  of 
taking  supply  down  or  moving  it  out  from  one  state  to  another 
state  or  moving  it  around,  was  legal  to  do  and  that’s  why  a  very 
strong law on the books that says no, the physical manipulation for 
those  purposes  is  wrong  and  so  we  are  now  giving  and  have  given 
and  passed,  as  I  said,  out  of  this  committee  to  the  FTC  that  new 
authority  on  the  physical  market  for  oil  and  distillates  which 
doesn’t exist. 

It doesn’t exist with the CFTC. That doesn’t exist with FERC. It 
now exists with the CFTC and the exact language is, it is unlawful 
for any person to directly or indirectly, to use or employ in connec-
tion with the purchase or sale of crude oil or gasoline or petroleum 
distillates at wholesale any manipulative devices or contrivances. 

So, the point is that we are looking to you to look at what could 
be  manipulative  devices  or  contrivances,  that’s  language  based  on 
the  SEC’s  rule  and  court  language  that  has  been  upheld,  to  focus 
on  the  notion,  as  my  colleague  Senator  Dorgan  was  saying,  some-
body  might  move  supply  around.  A  hedge  fund  might  hold  supply 
off  the  coast  of  the  United  States  for  several  days  waiting  for  the 
price to go up even more and then put the product into the market-
place,  thereby  shorting  the  domestic  U.S.  supply,  having  the  price 
rise  and  then  benefiting  from  the  sale  of  a  higher  price.  That’s 
what we want you to do. 

We want you to do a rule and investigate that. It’s not an author-

ity that any other agency has. It’s unique to the FTC.

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Thank  you,  Senator,  and  I  would  again  like  to  in-
vite  you  and  your  colleagues,  where  there  are  other  scenarios  of 
that  type  in  mind  to  let  us  know.  We  would  be  happy  to  continue 
to discuss those with you so that we keep them clearly in mind for 
ourselves as we proceed. 

Senator  CANTWELL.  Well,  I’ll  look  forward  to  that,  and  I  hope 
that you are very aggressive about the physical market and making 
sure that there is someone looking at the physical market. 

I do have a question about—the Committee is also having a hear-
ing  this  afternoon  on  DTV  transition  and  I’m  curious  as  to  what 
role  the  FTC  thinks  that  they  have  in  respect  to  the  digital  tele-
vision transition. 

I mean obviously the FCC and how they’re pursuing this, there’s 
a  lot  of  consumer  questions.  For  example,  I  recently  met  with  the 
AARP  representatives  who  told  me  that  there  is  a  1–800  number, 
1–800–DTV–2009, that consumers may think that they are actually 
calling  to  get  help  or  assistance  or  an  information  hotline,  but  it 
is  really  a  sales  pitch  for  satellite  television  services  and  so  what 
kinds  of  issues  will  the  FTC  be  taking  a  lead  on  as  it  relates  to 
the DTV transition? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  Senator  Cantwell,  staff  has  been  in  contact  with 
the  FCC,  the  agency  overseeing  this  transition.  The  NITA,  as  you 
probably know, is implementing the program that is providing cou-
pons  to  be  used  toward  the  purchase  of  these  set-top  converter 
boxes. 

But in mandating the DTV transition, Congress didn’t give a spe-
cific  role  to  the  FTC;  but  nevertheless,  we  are  going  to  be  working 
with  these  agencies  to  make  sure  that  there  is  no  unfair  or  decep-
tive conduct leading up to this transition. 

Senator CANTWELL. So, what do you think about a 1–800 number 
that lures consumers into calling only to find out it’s about a sales 
pitch for satellite purchase? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  A  1–800  number  based  at  the  Commission?  Is 

that what you’re asking? I didn’t quite—— 

Senator CANTWELL. No, I’m not saying it’s based at the Commis-
sion,  but  obviously  there  are  a  lot  of  people  that  are—we’re  going 
to have a gap this afternoon, I am sure, in what many of us think 
needs to be aggressively done to make sure that the transition goes 
as  smoothly  as  possible,  but  without  a  vacuum  of—I  mean  with  a 
vacuum of that happening. 

People  are  jumping  in  and  filling  this  role  and  there  are  many 
seniors  that  are  out  there  wondering  exactly  how  they’re  supposed 
to  proceed  here  and  when  they  see  this  1–800  number  DTV,  obvi-
ously  I  think  that  they  think  that  they’re  really  calling  a  1–800 
number for information but I’m happy to have you look into it. 

But what I was asking generally was what do you think the role 
is of the FTC in protecting consumers, even to the extent of getting 
more  directly  involved,  because  of  deceptive  practices  that  may  be 
occurring in this transition period or maybe even helping to outline 
what  are  the  best  practices  to  some  of  the  major  players  that  are 
going to be involved? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  I  believe  the  Commission  always  has  a  role  in 
looking out for the interests of consumers and if there’s any decep-
tion  or  unfairness  going  on  leading  up  to  the  transition,  that  is

something that we would be very interested in and would certainly 
like to be taking a look at. 

Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  We  do  have  800  numbers  for  consumer  com-
plaints and for identity theft victims, but I think it’s sort of as you 
envision it, Senator Cantwell. 

There  are  two  agencies  that  are  designated  to  be  the  lead  agen-
cies:  the  FCC  and  the  NTIA.  We  stand  ready  to  help  and  we  will 
fill  in  any  gaps  as  appropriate  and  we  do  consumer  protection. 
That’s what we’re good at. 

I  also  would  add  that  on  the  antitrust  side,  we  just  received  a 
petition  and  we  take  our  petitions  very  seriously  about  an  allega-
tion that the company that holds the licensing rights to some of the 
technology needed for digital television has raised royalty rates be-
yond  its  commitment.  That  might  be  in  violation  of  the  antitrust 
laws. It’s a petition we’re taking a look at. 

Mr. KOVACIC. And I would say, Senator, I think you’re absolutely 
right  with  your  colleagues  to  focus  on  industries  in  a  transition  of 
this  type.  To  add  to  my  colleagues’  comments,  I  think  there’s  also 
a  role  here  for  us  to  play  with  consumer  education;  that  is,  we’ve 
done quite a bit of work, in addition to the measures my colleagues 
have mentioned in posting alerts, doing publicity, working with our 
colleagues at the state level, too, to make sure that consumers have 
rough simple guidelines to keep in mind as this unfolds. 

Senator CANTWELL. Thank you very much, Senator Snowe. 
Senator  SNOWE.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chairwoman.  I  wanted  to 
ask questions related to identity theft and I know you probably ad-
dressed it earlier in your testimony, but I’m certainly concerned. 

I mean, it’s the Number 1 consumer complaint in America. 
Mr. KOVACIC. Yes, Senator. 
Senator  SNOWE.  We’ve  seen  a  major  transition  from  the  tradi-
tional  sources  of  fraudulent  practices  to  online  practices,  deceptive 
practices,  and  I  just  would  like  to  know  exactly  what  the  FTC  is 
doing  and  being  in  the  forefront  with  effective  methods  of  begin-
ning  to  challenge  this  significant  issue,  even  to  the  point  that  the 
IRS  advocate,  national  taxpayer  advocate  in  testifying  before  the 
Senate Finance Committee recently indicating it’s the most serious 
threat  to  the  IRS  and  to  taxpayers  and  is  becoming  more  pro-
nounced  and  that’s  why  I’ve  introduced  antiphishing  legislation 
with  my  colleagues,  Senator  Stevens  and  Senator  Nelson,  on  this 
question  because  that’s  another  dimension  of  identity  theft  that 
has escalated over this last year 57 percent from the previous year. 
So, it continues to go on and in Maine and throughout the North-
east  and  in  Florida,  we  had  a  major  security  breach  with  Hanna-
ford  Brothers  Company,  a  supermarket  food  chain  where  more 
than  four  million  consumers’  debit  and  credit  cards  were  breached 
recently  from  a  period  from  December  through  early  March.  I 
mean,  you  know,  it’s  significant  major  breach.  I  mean,  it  rep-
resented  165  stores  in  the  Northeast  and  another  106  stores  in 
Florida  and  51  of  those  stores  were  in  the  State  of  Maine  alone. 
So, we need to have the FTC again on the forefront of this major 
question that is only going to increase in terms of practices, decep-
tive  practices  that,  you  know,  we’re  finding  the  perpetrators  en-
gaged in. 

Mr. KOVACIC. May I respond, Senator?

50 

Senator SNOWE. Yes, you may. 
Mr.  KOVACIC.  And  I  invite  my  colleagues  as  always,  not  that  I 

could hold them back from adding their own thoughts as well. 

I  think  several  considerations  come  to  mind.  One  strategy  we’ve 
had  has  been  an  active  litigation  program  which  the  Committee  is 
aware  of.  Second,  we  have  an  intensive  program  of  education  for 
consumers so that they take basic precautions that, if taken, would 
serve to insulate them from some of the behavior. I think two other 
frontiers are worth mentioning as well. 

My  colleague,  Commissioner  Harbour,  mentioned  that  to  an  in-
creasing degree, we’re working with our international counterparts 
to  deal  with  this  issue.  As  you  know  and  in  the  work  you’ve  done 
on  your  legislative  proposal,  this  is  increasingly  an  international 
problem  and  the  wrongdoers  are  technologically  sophisticated. 
They’re geographically adroit, and they appreciate the gaps in indi-
vidual national systems of enforcement. 

We  have  two  countermeasures  in  mind  there.  One  is  to  work 
with  the  authority  that  this  body  has  given  us,  U.S.  SAFE  WEB, 
to work much more closely with our foreign counterparts and we’re 
applying  that  vigorously.  The  second  frontier  is  that  ultimately,  I 
think, civil sanctions for the wrongdoers are not enough and while 
we  would  welcome  additional  capacity  to  impose  civil  penalties  on 
the  wrongdoers,  my  impression  is,  and  you  may  well  have  a  dif-
ferent view of this, but my impression is, Senator, that most of the 
wrongdoers  in  fact  are  engaged  in  criminal  behavior.  They  are 
criminals, and the only way to deal with the serious wrongdoers is 
to take their freedom away. 

Our contribution to that as a body with civil enforcement author-
ity  has  been  to  work  much  more  closely  with  those  with  criminal 
prosecution  power  to  exercise  it.  We  prepare  cases  through  our 
Criminal Liaison Unit which was created less than 5 years ago. We 
provide them to the Department of Justice and to state authorities. 
I  see  this  as  the  only  way  for  the  most  serious  cases,  such  as 
phishing,  where  we’re  going  to  get  adequate  deterrence  with  that 
is  to  engage  the  criminal  enforcement  powers  of  their  jurisdiction 
and  our  foreign  counterparts  in  taking  away  the  freedom  of  the 
wrongdoers. 

Senator SNOWE. Does anybody else have a comment? 
Mr. ROSCH. Well, the only other comment I would make, Senator, 
is that, I’m sure you are aware of the fact that we’ve been very ac-
tive  in  this  area.  We’ve  brought  more  than  20  cases  against—data 
security cases in the last 2 years since I’ve been at the Commission 
and we’ll continue to do so. 

However,  one  of  the  great  things  about  the  proposed  legislation 
is  that  it  gives  us  civil  penalty  authority.  I  quite  agree  with  the 
Chairman  that  this  is  criminal  conduct  and  it  ought,  for  the  most 
part,  to  be  referred  to  criminal  authorities,  but  we’d  be  greatly 
strengthened in our own battle against data security breaches if we 
had  civil  penalty  authority  and  right  now,  the  only  time  we  can 
seek civil penalties for data security breaches is if it violates a spe-
cific  statute  that  gives  us  civil  penalty  authority  and  in  only  one 
of those 20 cases, the ChoicePoint case, was there a specific statute 
that  gave  us  that  authority.  That’s  one  of  the  great  things  about 
this statute.

Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  The  reauthorization  would  give  us  civil  penalty 
authority  for  violations  of  Section  5.  That  would  help  us  with  get-
ting  a  strong  deterrent  here  and  they  need  a  strong  deterrent  for 
the data security breach cases. 

There’s  also  legislation  out  of  your  Committee,  I  think,  or  that’s 
been  percolating  in  your  Committee,  that  would  give  us  specific 
data security civil penalty authority and that would be helpful, too. 
And  as  for  phishing,  I  agree  with  my  colleagues  that  it’s  criminal. 
We  refer  those  cases  to  Justice.  We  looked  at  your  bill.  I  know  it 
also  has  a  very  interesting  domain  name  registration  provision. 
That’s another issue. 

Ms. HARBOUR. I completely agree with the civil penalty authority 

that we really could use in this area. 

Just to back up for a moment and tell you some more about what 
we  do  in  the  area  of  identity  theft,  we  train  law  enforcement  au-
thorities about how to handle ID theft. We have a victim assistance 
program.  Ex-Chairman  Majoras  was  a  Co-Chair  on  the  President’s 
National Task Force on Identity Theft, which came out with 31 rec-
ommendations  this  year.  We  have  new  videos  on  YouTube  edu-
cating  consumers  about  phishing.  We  have  numerous  education 
programs  to  help  consumers  deter,  detect  and  defend  and  so  we’ve 
been very vigilant in this area. 

Senator  SNOWE.  Well,  I  appreciate  your  comments,  and  I  think 
it is important to know which tools are very effective and what we 
need  to  do  in  order  to  accomplish  that  and  to  move  expeditiously 
and  that’s  why  I’ve  introduced  my  legislation  and  it  does  impose 
civil,  you  know,  penalty  authority  because  it  is  important.  The 
United States hosts 32 percent of these phishing sites and so clear-
ly we’re the top country in the world. 

So,  I  just  think  that  we  have  to  do  everything  that  we  can  and 
I  appreciate  your  comments  and  that  will  be  helpful  to  us  as  we 
move forward. 
Thank you. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Senator  Snowe.  Senator  Klo-
buchar. We promise we are not keeping the FTC here all afternoon, 
but  we  are  going  to  have  another  round  of  questions,  if  anybody 
has them, and then we’ll conclude the hearing. 

Senator Klobuchar. 
Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  OK.  Thank  you.  I  have  follow-up  questions 

with some of the things that have already been raised. 

The  first  was  the  area  that  Senator  Dorgan  explored  with  you 
about  the  subprime  mortgages  and  we  all  remember  the  pictures 
he had blown up of what was going on there. 

The proposed FTC Reauthorization bill would provide the author-
ity to the state Attorneys General to in certain circumstances bring 
a  suit  for  a  violation  of  the  subprime  mortgage  loan  rules  promul-
gated by the Commission or a violation of the Truth-in-Responsible 
Lending Act or the Homeownership-and-Equity Protection Act. 

Yesterday,  I  received  a  letter  from  the  Attorney  General  for  the 
State  of  Minnesota  expressing  concerns  that  the  states  might  not 
have  the  funding  and  personnel  necessary  to  prosecute.  It’s  not 
that  they  don’t  want  to  prosecute  and  I  also  heard  this  yesterday 
in  Minnesota,  I  did  a  forum  on  the  mortgage  crisis  in  a  suburban 
area  with  a  number  of  experts  in  this  area,  and  one  of  the  county

commissioners  came  up  and  said  that  the  prosecutor  for  the  area 
that had been prosecuting the cases and doing a very good job also 
was concerned about resources and as you know, local and state in-
vestigative  agencies  are  facing  tremendous  resource  issues  and 
given  the  scope  of  the  problem  that  we’re  facing.  Do  you  believe 
that state Attorneys General have the resources necessary to bring 
these suits against all violating parties and what role do you think 
the  Commission  could  play  in  working  with  states  to  ensure  that 
the appropriate legal actions are taken? 

Ms.  HARBOUR.  I  think  the  Commission  would  be  very  happy  to 
work  with  the  state  agencies.  It’s  always  good  for  the  American 
consumer  to  have  another  cop  on  the  beat  and  if  the  states  can 
work parallel investigations with the Federal Trade Commission, I 
think that benefits consumers. 

In the past, we have had very cordial working relationships with 
the  state  Attorneys  General  in  some  of  our  competition  cases  and 
some of our consumer protection cases, and I see no reason why the 
agencies could not work together in this area as well. 

Mr. KOVACIC. Senator, I don’t know that any of us have had the 
chance, given the continuing evolution of the reauthorization draft, 
to consult with our colleagues in the states and talk about their re-
source capacity at the moment. 

So,  I  don’t  know  that  I  have  a  view,  maybe  my  colleagues  do, 
about where they are. I suspect your colleague from Minnesota has 
given  you  a  good  glimpse  of  that,  but  as  Commissioner  Harbour 
said,  whatever  the  resource  capacity,  I  think  our  modern  history 
has  been  to  work  as  closely  as  possible  to  make  the  best  possible 
use of the resources they would have. 

Mr.  ROSCH.  The  only  thing  I  would  add,  Senator,  is  that  there 
is  one  aspect  of  that  provision  that  I  think  is  terrific  and  that  is, 
that even if the states do bring actions, based upon this legislation, 
the  Federal  Trade  Commission  is  supposed  to  be  notified  by  the 
state that that action is pending and we have the right of interven-
tion. 

I think that’s critical in terms of nationwide coordination of these 
actions. The worst thing that can happen is that we have a patch-
work quilt. 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  Could  I  add,  Senator,  that  as  part  of  an  initiative 
that  we’ve  undertaken  in  the  past  2  years,  we’ve  been  having  an 
event every Fall now on a specific topic with our state counterparts 
that do competition and consumer protection. 

Our  first  year  was  gasoline.  Last  year  it  was  pharmaceuticals 
and  I  would  like  to  see  us  expand  that  framework  so  that  again, 
as in the case of other matters we discussed before, we move away 
from a fragmentation of effort and responsibility to see that the in-
dividual  public  institutions  that  have  shared  interests  work  in  a 
more  collaborative  way  to  make  sure  that  we  get  the  best  possible 
results from the resources that all of us have. 

This  would  be  another  area  where  I  would  expect  that  frontier 

of cooperation could continue. 

Mr.  LEIBOWITZ.  Particularly  because  so  much  of  this  fraud,  it’s 
Internet-based,  it  transcends  state  borders.  So,  we  need  to  work 
with  them,  they  want  to  work  with  us,  and  this  bill  gives  us  the 
ability to do that.

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Do  you  think  that  a  Federal  licensing 
standard would impact the ability to avoid our housing crisis? This 
is  an  amendment  by  Senator  Feinstein  that  I’m  also  cosponsor  of. 
It’s not yet been debated or voted on in the Senate. 

But  just  based  on  what  you’ve  seen  as  people  who  protect  the 
consumers’ rights, do you think that would be helpful to have some 
kind of Federal licensing standard for mortgage brokers? 

Mr.  KOVACIC.  I  don’t  have  an  immediate  reaction,  Senator,  but 
it’s  something  that,  if  you  would  permit  us,  I’m  sure  we  would  be 
glad  to  address  specific  questions  and  give  you  a  fuller  reply.  I 
don’t have an immediate reaction, Senator. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  OK.  Thank  you.  Then  last,  I  just  was  ask-
ing before about the past price gouging cases, not trying to get into 
this  situation,  as  we  may  be  bringing  it  to  your  attention,  but  if 
you  could  just  in  writing  afterwards  look  and  see  what  past  price 
gouging  investigations  have  gone  on  that  have  been  made  public 
and what were the results of those investigations. 

I  know  about  in  1998,  the  33-state  Attorneys  General.  This  was 
a generic drug investigation regarding Mylon and I think there was 
some  kind  of  a  $100  million  settlement.  I  think  the  facts  were  dif-
ferent than the case I just talked about here, and I know that you 
mentioned  another  case,  but  if  I  could  see  the  price  gouging  cases, 
the  anticompetitive  cases  in  the  drug  area  just  to  gauge  our 
chances,  if  we  go  this  way  or  if  we  need  to  follow  another  route. 

Mr. KOVACIC. Yes, Senator. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. Appreciate it. 
Senator  CANTWELL.  Thank  you,  Senator  Klobuchar,  and  thanks 
to the FTC Commissioners for being with us here today. We appre-
ciate  your  attention  to  the  issues  and  the  issues  that  we  have 
brought  up.  We  do  look  forward  to  working  with  you  not  just  on 
the  FTC  reauthorization  legislation  but  on  the  various  topics  that 
were brought up by my colleagues today. 

So, thank you very much. 
Mr. KOVACIC. Thank you, indeed, Senator. Thank you. 
Senator CANTWELL. The hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV 

TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Question 1. We know that junk food advertisements have a negative effect on chil-
dren’s health and are one of the reasons we are seeing such a huge rise in the inci-
dence of childhood obesity in our country. Over the past year and a half, the Senate 
and  FCC  Joint  Task  Force  on  Media  and  Childhood  Obesity  has  been  working  to 
find voluntary industry solutions to the overexposure of children to junk food adver-
tisements  on  television.  One  objective  of  the  health  and  advocacy  groups  partici-
pating  on  the  Task  Force  was  to  reach  a  compromise  whereby  television  stations 
and cable channels would agree to a balance of healthy and non-healthy food adver-
tisements  during  their  children’s  programming.  Rather  than  asking  for  a  complete 
ban  on  junk  food  advertisements,  the  children’s  health  and  media  advocates  were 
willing to allow a full half of food advertisements to be for unhealthy foods. Yet after 
a year and a half of negotiations, the media and advertising companies were unwill-
ing to make this compromise. Since voluntary industry action seems unlikely, what 
is  the  FTC  willing  to  do  to  ensure  that  our  children’s  health  is  not  being  com-
promised because they are being bombarded with advertisements for junk food? 

Answer. We share your concern about the rise in childhood obesity in our country. 
The FTC has undertaken a study, at the direction of Congress, to learn about com-
panies’ expenditures and activities in marketing food and beverage products to chil-
dren and adolescents. 

Recognizing the First Amendment issues raised by regulation of truthful and non- 
misleading  commercial  speech,  the  Commission  continues  to  be  a  strong  advocate 
of  addressing  the  issues  of  advertising  and  childhood  obesity  through  industry  self 
regulation.  The  FTC  has  undertaken  its  own  significant  efforts  to  encourage  self 
regulation  in  this  area.1 In  2005,  the  Commission  and  the  Department  of  Health 
and  Human  Services  convened  a  workshop  on  Marketing,  Self-Regulation,  and 
Childhood Obesity. That workshop—which brought together food manufacturers, en-
tertainment companies, academic experts, consumer advocates, and government offi-
cials—produced a series of recommendations, including self-regulation to change the 
nutritional profile of products marketed to children. 

In  July  2007,  the  FTC  and  HHS  convened  a  follow-up  forum  to  review  progress 
in the intervening 2 years. We learned that our 2005 workshop had provided a stim-
ulus for various industry initiatives, in particular the Children’s Food and Beverage 
Advertising Initiative announced in 2006 by the Council of Better Business Bureaus 
(CBBB). To date, 13 major food and beverage companies have joined the CBBB pro-
gram  with  concrete  pledges  that  when  fully  implemented—generally  by  the  end  of 
this  year—will  significantly  alter  the  landscape  of  food  marketing  to  kids.  Most  of 
these  companies  have  committed  either  to  not  advertise  directly  to  children  under 
12  or  to  limit  such  advertising—including  TV,  radio,  print,  and  Internet—to  foods 
that  qualify  as  ‘‘better  for  you’’  by  meeting  specified  nutritional  standards.  In  addi-
tion,  the  companies  have  pledged  to  limit  use  of  licensed  characters  in  advertising 
to  promote  healthier  products  and  lifestyles,  not  to  seek  product  placements  in 
child-directed  media,  not  to  advertise  food  or  beverages  in  elementary  schools,  and 
to  use  their  ‘‘better-for-you’’  products  in  interactive  games  (‘‘advergames’’)  directed 
to kids. 

At  the  same  time,  some  media  and  entertainment  companies,  including  Disney, 
Nickelodeon,  and  Cartoon  Network,  have  adopted  policies  to  limit  the  licensing  of 
their  characters  to  foods  meeting  nutritional  guidelines.  Moreover,  Ion  Media  Net-
works,  a  producer  of  children’s  weekend  television  shows,  has  committed  not  to  air 
advertising  for  less  healthy  foods  and  beverages  on  children’s  programs  and  to  cre-
ate story lines that encourage good eating habits and physical activity. The Commis-

1 The FTC is not part of the joint task force you describe.

sion expects that the CBBB Initiative, as well as the media and entertainment com-
pany efforts, will grow and expand coverage in the future. 

Question  2.  A  recent  New  York  Times  article  examined  how  food  marketers  use 
‘‘casual  games’’  or  advergames  on  their  websites  to  promote  junk  foods,  and  notes 
that  all  of  the  voluntary  limits  that  food  companies  have  placed  on  their  food  mar-
keting  to  kids  on  television  do  not  apply  on  the  web.  So  it  appears  that  while  the 
industry is publicly showing restraint in their advertising of unhealthy food to kids 
on television, they are also working harder to push such advertising to kids online, 
where  they  spend  an  average  of  twenty  minutes  with  such  advertising  instead  of 
30  seconds.  Therefore,  if  it  is  found  that  the  industry’s  voluntary  solutions  are  not 
enough  to  protect  children  from  being  inundated  by  advertisements  for  unhealthy 
foods  on  the  Internet,  what  are  the  FTC’s  plans  to  hold  the  media  and  advertising 
industries accountable? 

Answer. As noted above, recognizing the First Amendment issues raised by regu-
lation of truthful and non-misleading commercial speech, the Commission continues 
to be a strong advocate of addressing the issues of advertising and childhood obesity 
through industry self regulation. The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Ini-
tiative  discussed  above  covers  the  Internet  and  online  games.  As  the  member  com-
pany  pledges  become  fully  implemented,  we  expect  to  see  changes  in  websites  di-
rected  to  children.  If  a  company  publicly  states  that  it  will  change  its  advertising 
to  children,  and  then  does  not  do  so,  that  failure  to  match  its  promise  with  actions 
could constitute a deceptive practice, which is prohibited under Section 5 of the FTC 
Act. 

Question 3. Back in the spring of 2006, the FTC, under the direction of Congress, 
initiated  a  comprehensive  study  of  food  marketing  activities  and  expenditures  di-
rected  at  children  and  adolescents.  Could  you  please  state  when  the  FTC  is  going 
to be prepared to release the food marketing study? 

Answer. On July 31, 2007, after obtaining the necessary approval from OMB, the 
Commission  issued  compulsory  orders  to  44  food  and  beverage  companies,  seeking 
information  on  the  companies’  expenditures  and  activities  in  marketing  food  and 
beverage products to children and adolescents. The Commission’s orders sought data 
not  only  for  traditional,  measured  advertising  media—television,  radio,  and  print— 
but  also  for  newer  and/or  unmeasured  forms  of  marketing,  including  the  Internet 
and  other  new  electronic  media,  packaging  and  in-store  displays,  event  or  athletic 
sponsorship,  premiums,  product  placement,  character  licensing,  and  in-school  mar-
keting.  FTC  staff  received  responses  at  the  end  of  2007,  and  is  now  analyzing  the 
data and preparing the report. The Commission expects to issue its report this sum-
mer. 

Question 4. Does the FTC consider an IP address to be personally identifiable in-
formation under COPPA? If not, does the FTC need greater authority to protect chil-
dren  from  companies  collecting  information  about  children’s  interests  and  pref-
erences and using that information to target ads to children even if they don’t actu-
ally know the specific name of the child? What does the FTC think about the Euro-
pean Union’s move toward considering IP addresses as personally-identifiable infor-
mation? 

Answer. Under the COPPA Rule, an IP address, by itself, is not personally identi-
fiable information. The Rule defines ‘‘Personal Information,’’ as individually identifi-
able information about an individual collected online, including such information as 
first  and  last  name,  street  address,  e-mail  address  or  other  online  contact  informa-
tion,  telephone  number,  and  Social  Security  Number,  or  ‘‘a  persistent  identifier, 
such  as  a  customer  number  held  in  a  cookie  or  a  processor  serial  number,  where 
such identifier is associated with individually identifiable information . . .’’ 2 In the 
Rule’s Statement of Basis and Purpose, the Commission specifically noted that: ‘‘The 
Commission  believes  that  unless  such  identifiers  [static  IP  addresses  or  process  se-
rial  numbers]  are  associated  with  other  individually  identifiable  personal  informa-
tion, they would not fall within the Rule’s definition of ‘personal information.’ ’’ 

The Commission has authority beyond COPPA, pursuant to Section 5 of the FTC 
Act,  to  protect  children  from  unfair  or  deceptive  practices,  both  online  and  offline. 
The Commission staff is actively examining the legal and policy issues raised by on-
line  behavioral  advertising—the  practice  of  tracking  consumers’  activities  online  to 
target advertising to them. In November 2007, the Commission hosted a Town Hall, 
entitled  ‘‘Ehavioral  Advertising:  Tracking,  Targeting,  and  Technology,’’  which 
brought  together  a  diverse  group  of  interested  parties  to  examine  key  issues  raised 
by  the  practice.  Following  the  event  and  review  of  the  public  comments  received, 
the  Commission  staff  issued  for  comment  proposed  principles  to  guide  the  develop-

2 16 C.F.R. § 312.2.

ment of meaningful self-regulation of online behavioral advertising. The Commission 
staff  has  specifically  sought  comment  on  whether  information  collected  about  chil-
dren’s activities online should be treated as sensitive or otherwise given special con-
sideration.  The  comment  period  closed  on  April  11,  and  staff  is  carefully  reviewing 
the comments received. 

The  Commission  staff  is  also  looking  at  the  European  Union’s  position  on  IP  ad-
dresses as a part of its examination of the privacy issues surrounding online behav-
ioral  advertising.  The  staff  is  actively  conferring  with  technologists,  industry,  and 
privacy  advocates  on  emerging  technologies  that  may  affect  the  discussion  of  this 
issue. 

Question 5. If the FTC finds that an Internet company violated the behavioral ad-
vertising self-regulatory principles (such as having an overly confusing, technical, or 
lengthy  privacy  policy),  would  the  Commission  consider  that  to  be  a  ‘‘deceptive  or 
unfair trade practice’’ and consider an enforcement action? 

Answer. In issuing the behavioral advertising principles for public comment, FTC 
staff intended to launch a public dialogue about the privacy issues raised by behav-
ioral advertising, and to encourage meaningful self-regulatory efforts. The proposed 
principles, which are still being considered in light of the public comments received, 
should  not  be  viewed  as  a  regulation  or  as  an  interpretation  of  what  constitutes  a 
per se violation of the FTC Act. 

Of course, we note that regardless of the principles, the FTC retains the authority 
to  challenge  unfair  or  deceptive  practices  that  arise  in  the  behavioral  advertising 
area. Further, some of the principles—for example, the principles regarding reason-
able  security  for  data  and  material  changes  to  privacy  promises—have  a  basis  in 
FTC  enforcement  precedent.  The  FTC  has  brought  and  can  continue  to  bring  en-
forcement  actions  against  companies  that  fail  to  provide  reasonable  protections  for 
consumer  data.3 The  FTC  can  also  bring  enforcement  actions  against  companies 
that  use  data  in  a  manner  materially  different  from  promises  made  when  the  data 
was collected.4 However, whether or not a particular behavioral advertising practice 
constitutes a deceptive or unfair trade practice will depend on the facts of each case. 
Question 6. What are the types of behavioral marketing that are being used with 
children? Does the FTC believe that voluntary self-regulatory guidelines will be suf-
ficient to protect children from these forms of marketing? 

Answer.  As  indicated  above,  the  Commission  staff  currently  is  examining  the 
practices  of  online  behavioral  advertising  targeted  both  to  children  and  adults, 
through its request for public comment on proposed self-regulatory principles on be-
havioral  advertising.  We  expect  to  learn  more  about  the  types  of  behavioral  adver-
tising associated with children through this process. In this regard, we note that one 
comment  the  staff  received  regarding  the  proposed  principles  raised  the  concern 
that  children  would  be  less  likely  to  recognize  behavioral  advertising  and  less  able 
to  make  informed  choices  about  the  practices.  We  also  note,  however,  that  we  cur-
rently  are  not  aware  of  any  distinction  between  the  behavioral  advertising  tech-
niques  used  for  children  vs.  adults  and  have  no  data  on  the  products  and  services 
most promoted to children through behavioral advertising. 

Well-constructed  self-regulatory  efforts  are  important  to  protecting  children’s  in-
terests, especially in dynamic marketplaces such as online advertising. The Commis-
sion  staff’s  publication  of  the  proposed  behavioral  advertising  principles  may  spark 
further self-regulatory innovations. For example, the Network Advertising Initiative 
recently  proposed  a  prohibition  on  behavioral  advertising  to  children  under  the  age 
of 13. In addition to any self-regulatory changes sparked by the proposed behavioral 
advertising principles, existing self-regulatory programs, such as the Children’s Ad-
vertising  Review  Unit  of  the  Council  of  Better  Business  Bureaus  (CARU),  apply  to 
all  forms  of  online  marketing.  CARU’s  guidelines  and  enforcement  actions  provide 
strong  direction  and  incentive  to  industry  to  conduct  responsible  online  advertising 
to children. Finally, as noted above, the Commission also retains its authority under 
Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act  to  pursue  cases  of  unfair  or  deceptive  online  marketing 
to children.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE 

TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Question 1. The FTC has stated that ‘‘phishing is a criminal endeavor that is best 
suited  for  criminal  law  enforcement.’’  However,  the  FTC  actively  pursues  and  en-
forces  activities  such  as  spam,  identity  theft,  spyware,  data  security  breaches,  and 
even  pretexting.  Clearly,  phishing  is  directly  related  to  SPAM  and  identity  theft,  it 
[spear  phishing]  also  attributes  to  security  breaches  of  companies’  networks,  and 
even  phishing  mirrors  pretexting,  which  is  obtaining  telephone  records  using  false 
pretenses.  So  why  would  phishing  fall  outside  the  purview  and  enforcement  of  the 
FTC when it is so closely tied to these other FTC related areas? 

Answer.  Phishing  continues  to  be  one  of  the  most  vexing  problems  facing  con-
sumers,  but  it  is  difficult  to  address  through  FTC  enforcement  for  several  reasons. 
First, the architecture of the e-mail system creates significant investigative hurdles 
for the FTC to identify those responsible for sending phishing messages. The Inter-
net protocol for e-mail, known as SMTP, does not require the transmission of accu-
rate routing information. The only piece of information that must be accurate in an 
e-mail  is  the  recipient’s  address.  Phishers  exploit  this  flaw  in  SMTP,  thereby  mak-
ing  it  virtually  impossible  to  trace  the  source  of  a  phishing  e-mail  using  the  e-mail 
message’s  header  information.  And  because  phishers  are  not  generally  delivering  a 
product  to  a  consumer  or  using  their  own  account  information  for  financial  trans-
actions  that  we  can  trace,  there  are  few  civil  investigative  tools  we  can  use  to  find 
the phishers. 

In  addition,  the  nature  of  the  illegal  act  also  makes  phishing  better  suited  for 
criminal  than  civil  enforcement.  Indeed,  in  the  phishing  cases  that  the  FTC  has 
filed,  the  perpetrators  of  the  schemes  have  been  identified  only  with  the  consider-
able assistance of criminal investigative agencies and Federal prosecutors. Their ef-
forts  have  included  obtaining  ISPs’  records,  most  of  which  the  FTC  is  prohibited 
from  seeking  by  the  Electronic  Communications  Privacy  Act,  and  conducting 
stakeouts  of  addresses  where  items  purchased  by  the  phishers  are  being  delivered. 
Moreover,  because  phishing  involves  the  brazen  theft  of  consumers’  personal  finan-
cial information, it is doubtful that a civil injunction will provide appropriate deter-
rence. 

More  specifically,  phishing  often  differs  from  four  of  the  areas  that  you  mention: 
Spam:  Spammers  making  deceptive  claims  to  sell  products  are  generally  more 
amenable to FTC enforcement tools than phishers. In cases involving deceptive 
spam, we often have civil investigative avenues that we do not have in phishing 
cases; there is often a product being delivered or a money trail that can be fol-
lowed. These investigative avenues have enabled the FTC to bring a significant 
number of cases against deceptive spammers.1 
Data Security: The FTC can also use its enforcement tools effectively in the data 
security  area.  The  Commission’s  investigative  targets  in  these  cases  are  the 
companies  that  failed  to  take  reasonable  precautions  to  prevent  breaches,  not 
the  identity  thieves  who  could  take  advantage  of  their  failures.  Targets  in  our 
data  security  cases  are  concerned  about  their  reputation  in  the  marketplace; 
they  often  cooperate  in  FTC  investigations  and  comply  with  FTC  injunctions. 
Pretexting:  While  phishers  hide  behind  the  SMTP  protocol’s  cloak  of  anonymity 
and  are  engaged  in  outright  theft,  pretexters  often  operate  in  the  open.  Al-
though  they  may  provide  their  services  to  those  who  intend  to  do  harm  to  oth-
ers,  they  also  may  provide  services  to  legitimate  entities  such  as  investigative 
firms,  media,  or  even  attorneys,  and  they  operate  from  a  physical  location. 
Moreover, in addition to engaging in pretexting, many pretexters may also offer 
legitimate  legal  investigative  services.  Thus,  we  have  been  able  to  locate  the 
pretexters that have been the subject of our law enforcement. 
Spyware:  Spyware  can  have  characteristics  of  phishing  as  well  as  spam.  The 
most egregious forms of spyware, such as keyloggers, share the same attributes 
as  phishing:  the  perpetrators  are  extremely  difficult  to  track  down  and  are,  at 
their  core,  nothing  more  than  thieves.  FTC  enforcement  against  such  spyware 
purveyors  would  likewise  be  futile.  Other  types  of  spyware,  however,  are  more 
akin to the fraudulent and deceptive business practices that the FTC has tradi-
tionally tackled. For example, the FTC has successfully prosecuted a number of 
software developers and distributors who installed spyware on consumers’ com-
puters  for  the  purpose  of  displaying  advertising,  or  collecting  data  on  con-

1 In  some  cases,  spam  can  be  used  for  phishing  or  to  disseminate  spyware.  In  many  of  these 

cases, civil law enforcement is more difficult for the reasons described in the text.

sumers’  Internet  habits.2 The  FTC  has  also  sued  a  number  of  software  devel-
opers  for  using  deceptive  advertising  designed  to  frighten  or  intimidate  con-
sumers into purchasing their products.3 In these types of cases, the defendants 
openly and directly interacted with consumers, and operated as a business (e.g., 
employing programmers, maintaining a corporate entity and corporate bank ac-
counts, paying taxes on profits, etc.). Although these defendants caused massive 
consumer harm, they were not high-tech bank robbers (like phishers) but rather 
high-tech  con  men  operating  a  fraudulent  business.  As  a  result,  the  FTC  was 
able to leverage its investigative resources to locate and prosecute these defend-
ants,  and  was  able  to  deter  future  misconduct  through  injunctive  relief  and 
disgorgement. 
Identity  Theft:  Phishing  is  more  like  identity  theft,  a  clearly  criminal  act  that 
the FTC does not prosecute. Although the FTC plays a significant role in keep-
ing  data  out  of  the  hands  of  identity  thieves  by,  among  other  things,  enforcing 
data  security  laws  and  conducting  aggressive  outreach  and  education,  strong 
criminal  enforcement  is  the  best  approach  to  effectively  punish  and  deter  iden-
tity thieves. 

Although  civil  law  enforcement  may  not  be  the  most  effective  tool  against 
phishers, the FTC has taken aggressive steps to curb the impact of phishing by en-
couraging  industry  to  adopt  anti-phishing  technologies  and  by  providing  significant 
consumer education. Since 2004, the FTC has been urging ISPs and businesses that 
operate  their  own  e-mail  servers  to  adopt  domain-level  authentication  technologies. 
With domain-level authentication, an ISP or other operator of an e-mail server will 
be  able  to  verify  that  a  message  actually  comes  from  the  domain  appearing  in  the 
‘‘from’’  address.  The  FTC  is  encouraged  by  the  rapid  adoption  of  domain-level  au-
thentication  technologies  that  is  now  taking  place.  Combined  with  other  anti-spam 
technologies, domain-level authentication should reduce the likelihood that phishing 
e-mails  will  enter  consumers’  in  boxes.  And,  as  explained  below,  the  FTC  has  an 
ambitious  consumer  and  business  education  program  aimed  at  combating  phishing. 
Question  1a.  So  why  wouldn’t  the  FTC  want  to  ramp  up  its  efforts  and  allocate 
more resources toward phishing since phishing scams are one of the top threats fac-
ing consumers? 

Answer.  Although  the  FTC  does  not  plan  to  ramp  up  enforcement  efforts  for  the 
reasons  described  above,  it  continues  to  devote  resources  to  phishing.  Consumer 
education is a key tool for helping to reduce the number of consumers who fall vic-
tim  to  phishing  scams.  The  FTC  has  long  engaged  in  phishing  education  through 
consumer  alerts  and  its  OnGuardOnline.gov  computer  education  website,  which  in-
cludes information on phishing. 

On April 1, the Commission held a workshop with approximately 60 experts from 
business,  government,  the  technology  sector,  the  consumer  advocacy  community, 
and  academia  to  discuss  strategies  to  reach  and  teach  consumers  about  phishing. 
Several  new  initiatives  for  phishing  education  emerged  from  the  workshop.  First, 
the  FTC  launched  new  30-second  phishing  education  videos,  and  several  partici-
pants  agreed  to  place  the  videos  on  their  websites  and  other  channels.  Second,  the 
National  Cyber  Security  Alliance  announced  that  it  is  forming  a  Task  Force  on 
phishing  education,  and  FTC  staff  plans  to  participate.  Third,  several  participants 
supported  the  idea  of  using  a  landing  page  to  educate  consumers  about  phishing. 
Landing pages are web pages that ISPs and other entities would use to redirect con-
sumers  from  sites  identified  as  phishing  sites  to  educational  sites.  Specifically,  the 
Anti-Phishing Working Group will continue to develop informational phishing land-
ing  pages  and  will  translate  them  into  various  languages  for  use  by  domestic—as 
well as foreign—ISPs. 

Question  2.  At  the  FTC’s  recent  phishing  education  roundtable,  one  aspect  that 
was addressed was the need for greater Internet safety and cyber security education 
in  the  K–12  school  systems.  Some  research  has  shown  that  few  school  systems  are 
teaching  about  these  issues  and  as  a  result,  teenagers  and  young  adults  are  more 
susceptible  to  identity  fraud  because  they’re  less  likely  to  take  the  necessary  pre-
cautions  to  protect  themselves  from  various  types  of  identity  theft.  Can  Congress 
do more to assist the states to incorporate more school-based education on computer 
and cyber security? Would you support effective legislative efforts on this issue? 

Answer.  We  agree  that  more  school-based  education  on  computer  security,  cyber 
safety,  and  cyberethics  would  be  beneficial.  Several  participants  at  our  phishing

workshop  pointed  to  the  Virginia  school  system’s  legislatively-mandated  Internet 
safety  education  program  as  a  potential  model  program.  See  http://www.doe. 
virginia.gov/VDOE/Technology/OET/internet-safety-guidelines.shtm.  The  Commis-
sion  has  not  taken  a  position  on  the  respective  roles  of  Congress  and  the  states  in 
directing education. 

Question  3.  Last  fall,  evidence  surfaced  that  a  broadband  provider  was  blocking 
or, at the very least, slowing down a very popular peer-to-peer application. The pro-
vider had stated prior to this practice coming to light that it ‘‘does not block access 
to any applications.’’ 

In  addition,  the  operator  seemed  to  employ  questionable  practices  in  its  traffic 
management of this application such as ‘‘spoofing’’ IP packets—inserting reset pack-
ets  that  purported  being  from  the  downloading  P2P  computer  instead  of  from  the 
operator—and  may  have  infringed  upon  consumer  privacy  by  inspecting  IP  packet 
headers and payloads to determine what was P2P traffic. 

Has  the  FTC  looked  into  this  matter,  since  on  the  surface  these  actions  (lack  of 
disclosure and spoofing) may constitute a violation of Section 5—with respect to de-
ceptive acts and practices to both commerce and competition? 

Answer.  Although  the  FTC  cannot  comment  on  the  existence  of  a  specific  inves-
tigation, if an Internet service provider (ISP) misrepresents, or fails to disclose, ma-
terial  aspects  of  its  services  in  advertising  or  marketing  to  consumers,  it  may  be 
liable for violating Section 5 of the FTC Act. 

For  over  a  decade,  the  FTC  has  enforced  the  consumer  protection  and  antitrust 
laws in numerous matters involving Internet access. In particular, the FTC has in-
vestigated  and  brought  enforcement  actions  against  ISPs  for  allegedly  deceptive 
marketing,  advertising,  and  billing  of  Internet  access  services.4 The  FTC  has  ad-
dressed  Internet  access  and  related  issues  in  a  number  of  merger  investigations  as 
well.5 As  increasing  numbers  of  U.S.  consumers  have  chosen  to  subscribe  to 
broadband  services,  the  FTC  has  been  monitoring  the  claims  made  by  broadband 
providers in marketing their services to consumers. In February 2007, the Commis-
sion held a workshop on broadband competition that focused on net neutrality ques-
tions, including questions of disclosure by Internet service providers.6 In June 2007, 
Commission  staff  released  a  report  on  broadband  connectivity  competition  policy.7 
The FTC has devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to protecting 
competition and consumers in the important area of Internet access. 

Question  3a.  Has  the  FTC  received  any  formal  complaints  on  broadband  carriers 

blocking Internet applications? 

The FTC receives complaints directly from consumers and from other agencies re-
garding a host of consumer protection issues. During the three calendar years 2005 
through  2007,  we  received  over  2.8  million  consumer  complaints,  and  over  60,000 
of those complaints involved Internet access services. In an effort to locate consumer 
complaints that related specifically to broadband carriers blocking Internet applica-
tions,  Commission  staff  searched  the  Internet  access  complaints  for  key  words  and 
combinations  of  words  such  as  ‘‘application,’’  ‘‘bandwidth,’’  ‘‘block,’’  ‘‘broadband,’’ 
‘‘discriminate,’’ ‘‘Internet,’’ ‘‘net,’’ and ‘‘network’’ Staff found thousands of complaints 
containing these key words. Staff reviewed a small number of these complaints and 
found that they were unrelated to broadband carriers blocking Internet applications. 
It  further  refined  the  searches  for  complaints  that  included  the  word  ‘‘neutrality,’’ 
and  found  less  than  ten  complaints,  and  for  complaints  that  included  the  key  word 
‘‘block’’  with  either  the  word  ‘‘application’’  or  the  word  ‘‘content.’’  This  search  re-

sulted in approximately 100 complaints from the past three calendar years. Staff re-
viewed the comments in each of these complaints and found that approximately ten 
complaints may be related to the issue of blocked Internet applications.8 

In addition to receiving consumer complaints, the FTC at times receives more for-
mal  petitions  from  parties  requesting  the  FTC  to  investigate  potential  violations  of 
the  FTC  Act.  The  FTC  has  not,  however,  received  a  formal  petition  alleging  the 
blocking  of  an  Internet  application  by  a  broadband  ISP.  The  FTC  nonetheless  re-
mains  vigilant  to  any  ISP  conduct  that  may  violate  the  antitrust  or  consumer  pro-
tection laws. 

Question 4. Commissioner Leibowitz gave a speech to ICANN, back in June 2006, 
and  stated  that  the  WHOIS  databases,  which  provide  contact  information  of  a  do-
main  name/website  owner,  are  critical  to  the  agency’s  consumer  protection  mission. 
He  further  mentioned  that  the  FTC  is  concerned  that  any  attempt  to  limit  WHOIS 
would put its ability to protect consumers and their privacy in peril. Can you elabo-
rate on the concerns the Commission has about WHOIS? 

Answer.  FTC  staff  has  been  using  WHOIS  databases  for  the  past  decade.  As  the 
Commission  has  noted,  ‘‘WHOIS  databases  often  are  one  of  the  first  tools  FTC  in-
vestigators use to identify wrongdoers. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the impor-
tance of quickly accessible WHOIS data to FTC investigations.’’ 9 

When WHOIS information is available and accurate, it can provide us with a tre-
mendous  amount  of  information.  For  example,  in  our  cases  enforcing  the  CAN- 
SPAM Act and, in particular, the Adult Labeling Rule, accurate WHOIS information 
helped  us  identify  the  operators  of  pornographic  websites  that  were  promoted  via 
illegal  spam  messages.  In  the  recent  Media  Motor  spyware  case,10 FTC  staff  used 
domain  name  registration  information  from  WHOIS  databases  to  identify  the 
website operators who infected more than 15 million computers with destructive, in-
trusive  spyware.  In  that  case,  the  FTC  charged  that  the  defendants  tricked  con-
sumers  into  downloading  malware  that  changed  consumers’  home  pages,  tracked 
their  Internet  activity,  altered  browser  settings,  degraded  computer  performance, 
and disabled antispyware and anti-virus software. The WHOIS information was cru-
cial  to  the  FTC’s  efforts  to  locate—and  ultimately  stop—this  sophisticated  and  ex-
pansive spyware operation. 

Key to the utility of the WHOIS databases is our ability to access it in real time. 
The  alternative  to  real-time  access,  compulsory  process,  is  not  always  a  viable  op-
tion  for  three  reasons.  It  is  often  too  slow  in  the  context  of  fast-moving  Internet 
fraud;  it  risks  disclosing  the  existence  of  an  undercover  investigation;  and  it  may 
not be available or practical when the domain name registrar is located in a foreign 
jurisdiction.11 

Although WHOIS databases continue to yield critical information in our investiga-
tions, their utility has been hampered by lack of real-time access to WHOIS records 
due to proxy registrations and due to inaccurate information.12 

Question 4a. Has the FTC ever been hindered in its investigations due to the lack 
of accurate information or not having quick access to that information due to proxy 
services? 

Answer. Yes. Proxy registration services shield the identity of a website operator. 

This layer of anonymity has posed an obstacle in our investigations. 

8 The Commission staff replies orally or in writing to complaints it receives. In our responses, 
we  explain  that  the  Commission  acts  in  the  interests  of  all  consumers,  and  therefore  does  not 
generally  intervene  in  individual  disputes.  We  also  advise  the  consumers  that  the  information 
they provide would be recorded in the FTC’s complaint retention system and made available to 
numerous law enforcement agencies.

Assigned  Names  and  Numbers  Meeting  Concerning  WHOIS  Databases,  Marrakech,  Morocco, 
June 2006.

at http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/10/motorspyware.shtm. 

11 Although  the  U.S.  SAFE  WEB  Act  gives  the  FTC  tools  to  address  problems  of  obtaining 
information  from  foreign  sources,  using  these  tools  would  still  take  additional  time  and  re-
sources.  Particularly  in  the  online  world,  any  such  delay  could  lead  to  frustration  of  an  inves-
tigation. 

12 Some have expressed concern that public access to WHOIS databases compromises the pri-
vacy  of  domain  name  registrants.  The  Commission  has  recognized  that  non-commercial  reg-
istrants  may  require  some  privacy  protection  from  public  access  to  their  contact  information, 
and  that  these  registrants  can  be  provided  such  protection  without  compromising  real-time  ac-
cess by law enforcement agencies. See Prepared Statement of the Federal Trade Commission on

For  example,  in  one  FTC  investigation,  FTC  staff  encountered  at  least  six 
websites that had proxy registrations, including one registered to a proxy service of 
a  domestic  domain  name  registrar  and  two  others  registered  to  proxies  for  foreign 
domain  name  registrars.  Our  inquiry  into  these  websites  was  stalled  by  the  need 
for  compulsory  process  and,  indeed,  most  of  the  websites  closed  down  before  we 
could  pursue  an  alternative  route.  In  the  Media  Motor  case  described  above,  the 
WHOIS  results  for  a  number  of  target  websites  identified  a  proxy  service  in  place 
of the registrant’s name. To identify the registrant, the FTC had to contact the reg-
istrar  that  operates  the  proxy  service.  This  extra  step  lengthened  the  time  it  took 
for  FTC  staff  to  identify  the  true  registrant  and  initiate  law  enforcement  action  to 
stop the ongoing spyware operation. 

Even where access is not stymied by proxy registrations, much of the information 
in  the  WHOIS  databases  continues  to  be  inaccurate  or  incomplete.  FTC  investiga-
tors  can  cite  numerous  instances  where  the  WHOIS  data  has  turned  up  domain 
names with facially false addresses and contact information, including websites reg-
istered  to  ‘‘God,’’  and  ‘‘Mickey  Mouse,’’  addresses  listed  as  ‘‘XXXXXXX,’’  and  obvi-
ously  fake  telephone  numbers,  such  as  111–111–1111.  FTC  investigators  have  had 
to  spend  many  hours  tracking  down  perpetrators  of  Internet  fraud  because  of  inac-
curate WHOIS data—hours that could have been spent pursuing other targets. 

Question  4b.  Several  law  enforcement  agencies  have  serious  concerns  about  do-
main name registrars offering proxy or privacy services to domain name registrants, 
and  NTIA  even  enforced  the  prohibition  of  proxy  services  for  the  .us  TLD.  What  is 
the FTC’s position on proxy services that are utilized by commercial websites? 

Answer.  The  FTC  has  recognized  that  registrants  of  non-commercial  websites 
might  require  some  privacy  protection  from  public  access  to  their  contact  informa-
tion,  without  compromising  appropriate  real-time  access  by  law  enforcement  agen-
cies.  However,  the  FTC  does  not  believe  commercial  websites  have  similar  legiti-
mate privacy concerns or a legitimate purpose to operate under a shroud of anonym-
ity. As explained above, proxy registrations can either slow down or completely frus-
trate FTC investigations into the activities of commercial websites. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. JOHN ENSIGN 

TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 

Question.  Chairman  Kovacic,  in  December  2006,  ten  of  the  country’s  leading  jew-
elry  industry  trade  associations  petitioned  the  FTC  to  address  the  practice  of  mar-
keting  laboratory-created  diamonds  as  ‘‘cultured  diamonds’’  to  consumers.  It  is  my 
understanding  that  the  term  ‘‘cultured’’  has  traditionally  been  used  in  the  jewelry 
industry only to refer to organically produced materials, like pearls. These industry 
associations  strongly  believe  that  the  FTC’s  Guidelines  for  the  jewelry  industry 
must be amended to protect consumers from deceptive or unfair business practices. 
It  has  been  nearly  one  and  a  half  years  since  that  petition  was  filed  and  the  peti-
tioners  have  not  yet  received  a  response.  Can  you  give  us  an  update  on  the  status 
of the FTC’s response to this petition? 

Answer.  The  FTC  staff  is  currently  reviewing  the  petition  requesting  that  the 
Commission  amend  its  Guides  for  the  Jewelry,  Precious  Metals,  or  Pewter  Indus-
tries  to  address  the  use  of  the  term  ‘‘cultured’’  to  describe  laboratory-created  dia-
monds.  The  FTC  staff’s  review  includes  a  thorough  analysis  of  the  petition  and  the 
consumer perception data submitted in support of the petition, to determine wheth-
er the use of the term ‘‘cultured’’ to market laboratory-created diamonds constitutes 
an  unfair  or  deceptive  trade  practice  in  violation  of  Section  5  of  the  FTC  Act.  In 
addition, the staff is considering how its proposed recommendation might affect do-
mestic  and  international  commerce.  Following  this  analysis,  the  staff  will  rec-
ommend  to  the  Commission  a  proposed  response.  The  FTC’s  review  will  be  com-
pleted  as  quickly  as  possible  consistent  with  the  serious  attention  the  petition  de-
serves.
