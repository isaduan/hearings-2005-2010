HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Transitioning the Environmental
Measurements Laboratory to the
Department of Homeland Security

THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2007

10:00 A.M.–1:30 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

The  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  (EML),  located  in  New  York  City,
was transferred from the Department of Energy to the Department of Homeland Se-
curity’s  Science  &  Technology  Directorate  in  2003,  under  Section  303  of  the  Home-
land  Security  Act  of  2002.  The  laboratory—established  in  1947—was  ostensibly
transferred because of its expertise in low level radioactive measurements, analysis
and  assessments  and  its  ability  to  significantly  contribute  to  the  S&T  Directorate’s
responsibilities  as  envisioned  in  Section  302  of  the  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002
to  develop  countermeasures  to  radiological  and  nuclear  terrorist  threats;  conduct
basic and applied research, development, demonstration, testing, and evaluation ac-
tivities relevant to DHS; detect, prevent, protect against and respond to terrorist at-
tacks;  and  to  transfer  relevant  technologies  or  abilities  to  Federal,  State,  local  gov-
ernments and private sector entities.

When Congress transferred this laboratory from DOE to DHS, there was a logical
expectation  that  a  lab  which  specialized  in  radiation  detection  and  supported  the
work of State and local officials and first-responders would be a natural fit with an
agency  which  was  charged  with  protecting  the  country  from  radiological  threats.
Having  a  federal  radiation  detection  laboratory  located  in  the  heart  of  New  York
City,  which  after  the  9/11  attack  was  clearly  in  the  top  tier  of  potential  targets  for
terrorists, seemed like an important asset for DHS.

Yet  since  its  transfer  to  DHS,  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  has
largely been left to flounder. Rather than exploiting and expanding the unique skills
and  capabilities  of  the  laboratory  that  could  have  clearly  contributed  to  some  of
DHS’  most  important  work,  DHS  has  terminated,  transferred  and  curtailed  key
EML programs. Top management at DHS also spent an inordinate amount of time,
energy  and  resources  planning  for  the  lab’s  ultimate  closure.  By  2007,  the  DHS
Science  &  Technology  Directorate  had  stripped  the  lab  of  its  radioisotope  chemical
analysis  labs  critical  for  the  continuation  of  its  radiochemistry  Quality  Assessment
Program  (QAP)  praised  by  both  State  and  federal  participants  as  directly  contrib-
uting  to  homeland  security  efforts.  Other  projects  EML  initiated  with  local  first  re-
sponders  in  New  York  City,  including  a  network  of  roof-top  radiation  sensors,  have
been  halted.  Other  programs  have  been  started,  stopped  and  then  transferred.  In
one  of  DHS’s  most  astounding  decisions,  it  terminated  the  lab’s  entire  global  radi-
ation  monitoring  network—in  existence  since  1963—and  halted  plans  to  install  a
new  EML  built  radiation  monitor  in  China,  near  the  North  Korean  border  in  Octo-
ber 2005. This occurred one year before the North Korean nuclear test.

Congress  never  intended  for  the  lab’s  programs  to  be  disbanded,  or  that  the  lab-
oratory  be  closed.  The  detailed  plans  to  close  the  lab,  first  initiated  in  2005,  were
never signed by the Under Secretary of Science and Technology, Charles McQueary.
Admiral  Jay  Cohen,  who  took  over  that  post  last  August,  has  told  the  Committee
staff  that  he  now  intends  to  put  the  lab  on  a  new  path  and  anticipates  making  it
a valued DHS asset.

In  the  107th  Congress,  the  Committee  on  Science  played  a  key  role  in  drafting
the  legislation  that  established  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  particularly
in  creating  the  S&T  Directorate.  As  a  result,  the  Subcommittee’s  oversight  role  re-
garding the S&T Directorate is particularly important. Up until now, the seemingly
intentional actions by DHS to strip the Environmental Measurements Laboratory—
a critical national asset—of its programs, projects and activities have occurred with-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

in  the  inner  sanctum  of  the  S&T  Directorate  without  any  explanation  to  Congress
or the public of the rationale for these inexplicable actions. In fact, even as the S&T
Directorate  was  drafting  plans  to  close  the  laboratory  and  DHS-hired  contractor
Booz  Allen  Hamilton  was  writing  up  a  ‘‘communications  plan’’  on  the  ‘‘message’’
DHS  was  planning  to  disseminate  to  both  Congress  and  the  public  about  why  the
lab  was  being  closed,  the  S&T  Directorate  was  telling  Congress  that  they  expected
the EML to ‘‘serve an enduring role’’ in supporting DHS.

The  Subcommittee  hearing  will  seek  to  obtain  a  fuller  public  disclosure  of  how
and why DHS terminated many of the lab’s programs, why the S&T Directorate was
unable—or  unwilling—to  chart  a  new  course  for  the  Environmental  Measurements
Laboratory and who was responsible for undermining the success of the EML since
it was transferred to DHS. The Subcommittee hearing will fully examine the issues
that  have  led  to  the  termination  and  transfer  of  some  of  the  lab’s  programs  that
could  have  played  a  critical  role  in  both  homeland  and  national  security-related
issues. The conditions leading to the laboratory’s current state need to be examined,
resolved and prevented from occurring again. Although Admiral Cohen has recently
pledged not to close the lab, it is important that the Subcommittee ensure that the
S&T  Directorate  has  a  detailed  strategic  plan  and  clear  vision  for  the  lab  that  will
ensure they fully utilize the EML in the future.
Background of the Environmental Measurements Laboratory

The  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory—which  has  undergone  several
name  changes  since  it  was  first  established  in  1947  as  the  Medical  Division  of  the
Atomic  Energy  Agency—moved  into  its  current  location  in  Manhattan  in  1957.
Within the Department of Energy the small laboratory moved from the Office of En-
ergy Research to the Office of Environmental Management in 1997 to focus on envi-
ronmental monitoring, decommissioning and decontamination efforts around the Na-
tion’s nuclear weapons complex. Unlike the much larger DOE laboratories, including
Los  Alamos,  Lawrence  Livermore  and  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory,  the
EML has always received much less notice, financial support and attention. To some
degree, it was never able to compete with these other larger, better equipped, multi-
purpose  laboratories  within  the  DOE  complex.  Still,  the  EML  developed  world  re-
nowned  capabilities  in  low-level  radiation  measurements  and  has  been  praised  by
State  and  federal  officials  for  their  contribution  to  both  homeland  security  and  na-
tional security-related programs.

The  lab’s  scientists  and  engineers  have  designed  and  fabricated  unique  radiation
detection  instruments,  played  a  major  role  in  evaluating  the  impact  of  environ-
mental contamination from nuclear weapons fallout and developed a global network
of radiation sensors that performed a critical role in U.S. and international nuclear
non-proliferation efforts. In the 1970s the EML established a radiochemistry Quality
Assessment Program (QAP) that grew to include the participation of more than 150
labs, and they provided a support role for DOE’s Nuclear Emergency Search Teams,
whose task is to locate and disable nuclear weapons or radiological dispersal devices
in the U.S. and abroad.

But one walk down the lab’s hallways today and it is evident the lab has received
only  minimal  upgrades  since  it  moved  to  its  current  location  five  decades  ago.  Its
peak  staff  of  about  120  employees  also  dropped  by  half  by  the  time  it  was  trans-
ferred to DHS in 2003. The cost of maintaining the large facility in Manhattan has
been significant. In addition, some employees who were nearing retirement had be-
come stagnant in their positions. Yet, the Environmental Measurements Laboratory
developed  an  unquestioned  world  renowned  reputation  for  radiation  analysis.  Its
non-proliferation  and  quality  assurance  programs,  which  began  in  the  1960s  and
1970s  and  were  still  active  when  the  lab  moved  to  DHS,  had  no  equals  either  in
the Federal Government or commercial sector.
Quality Assessment Program (QAP)

The  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  established  the  Quality  Assess-
ment  Program  (QAP)  in  1976  to  perform  ‘‘quality  assurance’’  or  ‘‘performance  eval-
uation’’ tests designed to assess the accuracy of radiological measurements reported
by  radiochemistry  laboratories.  Department  of  Energy  contractor  laboratories  were
required  to  participate  in  the  program.  But  other  non-DOE  laboratories,  including
federal  agencies,  commercial  laboratories  and  State  public  health  labs  from  Cali-
fornia,  Washington,  Wisconsin,  Texas,  Tennessee,  Illinois,  Georgia,  Idaho,  Kansas,
New  York  and  New  Jersey,  also  participated,  150  laboratories  in  all.  When  EML
was  transferred  to  DHS,  EML  scientists  attempted  to  sharpen  the  QAP’s  focus  on
emergency  response  capabilities,  rather  than  routine  environmental  analysis.  But
DHS  terminated  the  program  in  2004.  Most  disturbing  is  that  in  interviews  with
Subcommittee staff Caroline Purdy, Former Acting Director of the Office of National

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

Laboratories  in  the  S&T  Directorate,  who  directed  that  the  program  be  closed,  was
completely  unaware  of  what  the  Quality  Assessment  Program  actually  did  or  how
it might play a role within DHS. ‘‘I don’t remember any meetings discussing QAP,’’
said  Purdy.  She  said  that  QAP  was  an  ‘‘old  program’’  that  had  been  around  a  long
time  and  that  her  ‘‘general  assumption  was  that  the  DOE  National  Labs  would  do
this.’’  John  Clarke,  Deputy  Director  of  the  Office  of  National  Laboratories,  also
clearly  saw  no  value  in  the  QAP  or  its  relevance  to  homeland  security  issues  and
also seemed unclear on what the program actually did. His justification for seeking
its closure was that it was another ‘‘self generating’’ task that EML had developed.
Ironically, the S&T Directorate began the shut down of QAP and EML’s chemistry
laboratories  at  a  time  when  DHS  was  standing  up  a  new  interagency  organization
dubbed  the  Integrated  Consortium  Laboratory  Network  or  ICLN.  Government  offi-
cials  from  the  Department  of  Energy,  National  Institutes  of  Standards  and  Tech-
nology  and  Environmental  Protection  Agency  told  Subcommittee  staff  that  they  be-
lieve  EML’s  Quality  Assessment  Program  would  have  been  a  key  asset  and  perfect
fit  in  the  newly  formed  ICLN  organization  to  coordinate  proficiency  testing  at
radiochemistry labs.

The  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory’s  QAP  chemistry  labs  are  now  in
the final stages of decommissioning. In the process the lab has donated or disposed
of  more  than  $1.7  million  worth  of  equipment.  The  Food  and  Drug  Administration
and  U.S.  Secret  Service  took  some  of  the  radiation  samples  and  the  EML  donated
$6,000  of  brand  new  flasks  and  beakers  to  Stuyvesant  High  School  in  New  York
City. Dr. Damon Chaky, a scientist at the Pratt Institute received two gamma radi-
ation detectors valued at $20,000 each.
Global Monitoring Program

Since  1963,  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  had  developed,  fab-
ricated and maintained a global network of low-level radionuclide sensors. The EML
monitoring system was the most extensive and comprehensive low-level radionuclide
sampling network in the world, comprised of a Global Fallout Program, Surface Air
Sampling  Program  (SASP)  and  Remote  Atmospheric  Measurements  Program
(RAMP).  The  network  included  more  than  70  monitoring  sites  in  the  U.S.  and
abroad, including Antarctica, Australia, the Bahamas, Bolivia, Chile, China, France,
Greenland,  Panama,  Singapore,  South  Africa,  Turkmenistan,  the  United  Kingdom,
Uruguay  and  Venezuela.  The  network  has  been  used  extensively  by  scientists  to
validate  global  meteorological  and  atmospheric  transport  models.  But  the  system
also collected data that assisted U.S. and international nuclear non-proliferation ef-
forts, helping to rapidly identify any new sources of radiological activities due to ac-
cidental releases or nuclear weapons tests.

In  January  2002  EML  established  a  monitoring  station  in  Guiyang  in  southwest
China  and  in  April  2002  it  established  a  second  site  at  Mt.  Waliguan.  In  August
2003, EML also installed a RAMP system in Ryori, Japan. The lab had plans to in-
stall a new radiation detector at Long Feng Shan in China, near the North Korean
border that would have been installed in early 2006. But DHS terminated the lab’s
entire  global  radiation  monitoring  program  in  October  2005,  including  its  plans  to
install a new detector near the North Korean border. This was particularly unfortu-
nate,  since  North  Korea  conducted  a  nuclear  weapons  test  in  October  2006.  Al-
though  portions  of  the  program  were  classified,  the  significance  of  the  program  to
U.S.  nuclear  non-proliferation  efforts  would  have  appeared  obvious  to  anyone  who
had looked.

The  EML  sent  e-mails  to  the  sites  maintaining  the  radiation  detectors  and  in-
formed those involved that they should dispose of the EML radiation sensors in ac-
cordance  with  local  laws.  Much  of  the  equipment  was  old  and  it  would  have  been
too  expensive  to  pack  them  up  and  return  them  to  EML.  The  new  radiation  sensor
that EML had planned to install at Long Feng Shan, China, near the North Korean
border  was  never  fully  assembled  and  pieces  of  that  planned  detector  remain  at
EML today.

With  the  specialized  skills  that  the  lab’s  core  group  of  scientists  and  engineers
possessed  and  their  ability  to  design,  fabricate  and  manufacture  unique  radiation
sensors and their history of developing and producing plans and protocols for meas-
uring  and  identifying  radioactive  isotopes  it  is  particularly  disturbing  that  S&T
Managers  could  not  envision  how  this  laboratory—based  in  the  heart  of  Manhat-
tan—could have contributed to DHS. Instead, the lab’s newly proposed projects were
rejected, its former programs were terminated and its ability to function at virtually
any  level  was  micromanaged  to  the  extreme.  No  one,  it  seems,  in  the  S&T  Direc-
torate  had  a  clear  understanding  of  what  some  of  the  lab’s  most  impressive  pro-
grams  did  or  how  they  might  play  a  role  in  homeland  security.  Instead,  they  were

viewed as not being part of the ‘‘DHS mission’’ and were terminated. The leadership
chasm that existed in the S&T Directorate was chilling.

In fact, it is not clear how the S&T Directorate expected EML to thrive, even func-
tion,  within  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  given  the  constraints  that  were
placed  on  them.  It’s  extraordinarily  telling,  for  instance,  that  the  lab  had  no  com-
puter  access  to  the  DHS  Intranet  until  2005,  two  years  after  EML  transferred  to
DHS. Even then, EML was only provided with four computers that could access the
DHS  Intranet  and  one  printer,  despite  the  fact  they  had  more  than  40  employees.
John  Clarke  also  prevented  DHS  employees  from  attending  conferences  and  rou-
tinely questioned their travel plans. Documents DHS provided to the Subcommittee
show  Clarke  did  this  because  of  concerns  over  the  laboratory’s  financial  manage-
ment.  But  even  Marc  Mandler,  former  Technical  Director  of  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard
Research  &  Development  Center,  who  was  detailed  to  DHS  for  a  short  four  month
tour  in  2004  and  reviewed  the  lab’s  capabilities,  along  with  Clarke,  believed  the  fi-
nancial  microscope  that  was  placed  on  EML  was  ‘‘very  extreme,’’  he  said.  ‘‘They
could not even buy toilet paper,’’ said Mandler, half-joking.

In  the  critical  Mandler/Clarke  review  that  was  concluded  in  October  2004,  Marc
Mandler says he provided an honest assessment of what he encountered during his
short tenure at DHS, but acknowledges that he did not speak to individuals outside
of  EML  to  get  their  perspective  on  the  lab  or  work  the  lab  had  done  for  them.
Mandler, who is well respected, said he felt that many of the EML employees were
steadfastly  resistant  to  change  and  unable  to  tailor  their  work  towards  their  new
mission  at  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.  But  he  did  believe  the  staff  that
was willing to move in this direction were technically proficient, could contribute to
homeland security efforts and that the lab had strategic value because of its location
in  the  midst  of  New  York  City.  Mandler  says  he  respected  John  Clarke,  but  also
says that the way the DHS S&T Directorate managed the Environmental Measure-
ments  Laboratory  had  a  lot  to  be  desired.  ‘‘It  was  micromanagement  without  direc-
tion,’’ said Mandler.
Witnesses

The  Subcommittee  hearing  will  use  three  separate  panels  to  tell  the  story  of  the
Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  and  to  explore  and  explain  the  systemic
mismanagement  that  occurred  on  the  part  of  the  Science  &  Technology  Directorate
in supervising, managing and leading the laboratory.

Panel  1  will  be  composed  of  individuals  from  local,  State  and  Federal  Govern-
ment agencies that have utilized the services of EML as well as a former DHS offi-
cial  in  the  S&T  Directorate  who  quit  over  the  way,  he  believed,  the  laboratory  was
being mistreated. Two of these witnesses have had programs they relied on with the
EML  terminated  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.  Mrs.  Lynn  Albin,  Ra-
diation  Health  Physicist,  Office  of  Radiation  Protection,  Washington  State  Depart-
ment  of  Health,  utilized  EML’s  QAP  for  nearly  two  decades.  She  will  address  the
significance  this  program  had  on  preparing  her  agency  for  the  DHS-led  TOPOFF2
counterterrorism  exercise  in  2003.  Mr.  Charles  F.  McBrearty,  Jr.,  Former  Direc-
tor  of  Materials  Technology,  Air  Force  Technical  Applications  Center,  Patrick  Air
Force  Base,  Florida,  just  retired  last  month  from  the  Air  Force.  He  had  a  relation-
ship  with  EML  for  nearly  three  decades  and  took  a  trip  to  DHS  Headquarters  in
D.C. to make the case that EML was a critical asset and that in his experience they
were  ‘‘the  masters  of  the  universe  in  terms  of  radiation  measurements.’’  Despite
that,  DHS  terminated  all  of  EML’s  work  for  the  Air  Force.  Assistant  Commis-
sioner Jonathan A. Duecker, New York Police Department, Counterterrorism Bu-
reau,  will  describe  the  work  that  EML  has  been  performing  for  first  responders  in
the  New  York  region  since  9.11.  Dr.  Tony  Fainberg,  Former  Program  Manager,
Radiological  &  Nuclear  Countermeasures,  Office  of  Research  and  Development,
Science  &  Technology  Directorate,  Department  of  Homeland  Security,  will  describe
how he believed many of EML’s programs could have benefited DHS. Fainberg wit-
nessed many of the lab’s programs killed off by the S&T Directorate and he eventu-
ally  quit  when  he  concluded  that  the  directorate  was  intent  on  closing  the  labora-
tory.

The  sole  witness  for  Panel  2  is  Dr.  John  F.  Clarke,  Deputy  Director,  Office  of
National  Laboratories,  Science  &  Technology  Directorate,  Department  of  Homeland
Security.  Clarke  is  a  Pacific  Northwest  National  Laboratory  employee  detailed  to
the S&T Directorate, and is a key player in the ultimate degradation of the Environ-
mental Measurements Laboratory’s capabilities and programs.

Panel 3 will look ahead to the Environmental Measurements Laboratory’s future.
Admiral  Jay  M.  Cohen,  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology,  Department
of  Homeland  Security  and  Mr.  Vayl  Oxford,  Director,  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection

Office, Department of Homeland Security will both discuss what role they see for the
lab moving forward.

Conclusion

The  history  of  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory—in  the  four  years
since  it  was  transferred  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security—should  serve  as
a  case  study  of  government  mismanagement  and  incompetence.  Once  a  valued  crit-
ical  asset,  the  lab  has  been  stripped  of  some  of  its  most  successful  and  important
programs and sorely mischaracterized by a small handful of officials in the S&T Di-
rectorate.  John  Clarke  particularly  served  as  a  funnel  through  which  information
about EML flowed to many others within the S&T Directorate. His motivations may
never  be  clear,  but  Clarke’s  mischaracterization  of  the  Environmental  Measure-
ments Laboratory, the skills of its staff and the lab’s programmatic capabilities are
unmistakable.  Subcommittee  staff  found  that  he  has  misconstrued  conversations
with both local first responders and non-DHS federal agencies about their stated po-
sitions  regarding  specific  EML  projects  that  Clarke  eventually  terminated.  Even
worse, Maureen McCarthy, Clarke’s supervisor and the former Director of the Office
of  Research  and  Development  (ORD)  within  the  DHS  S&T  Directorate  told  Sub-
committee  staff  that  John  Clarke  had  no  ‘‘programmatic  role’’  in  the  S&T  Direc-
torate.  If  he  was  involved  in  making  programmatic  decisions  about  the  EML,  said
McCarthy—which  he  clearly  and  repeatedly  was—this  was  outside  of  his  set  of  re-
sponsibilities.

But  McCarthy  had  been  made  aware  of  Clarke’s  propensity  to  overstep  his  lines
of authority, particularly when it came to management of the Environmental Meas-
urements  Laboratory,  by  at  least  two  DHS  officials  in  2005,  including  Tony
Fainberg.  Responsibility  for  reigning  in  the  detrimental  actions  by  John  Clarke  re-
garding  EML  clearly  fell  to  her.  While  McCarthy  says  she  spoke  to  Clarke  about
some of his actions, it clearly had little if any impact. Clarke managed to terminate
EML’s  work  for  the  Air  Force,  for  example,  even  after  those  conversations.  In  fact,
Tony Fainberg ended up quitting his position in the S&T Directorate partly because
of  the  actions  of  John  Clarke  and  partly  because  no  one  above  Clarke  was  willing
to  prevent  him  from  essentially  destroying  the  programs,  resources  and  morale  at
the Environmental Measurements Lab.

Admiral  Cohen  has  told  Subcommittee  staff  that  he  has  no  plans  to  close  EML.
He  intends  to  maintain  the  lab’s  presence  in  New  York  City  and  to  re-emphasize
the  lab’s  core  mission  towards  the  Testing  &  Evaluation  (T&E)  of  equipment.  This
is  a  role  the  lab  has  taken  on  since  9.11  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  for  the  New  York  and
New  Jersey  first  responder  community  in  any  event.  Admiral  Cohen  sees  EML  be-
coming  one  of  the  premier  testing  and  evaluation  centers  for  DHS  nationwide,  he
says.  In  addition,  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  (DNDO)  intends  to  utilize
about ten of the EML staff in the Countermeasures Test Bed (CMTB) and other re-
lated efforts that focus on the detection and identification of radiological threat ma-
terial in the New York area.

It  is  encouraging  that  after  more  than  four  years  the  S&T  Directorate  seems  to
finally  have  some  direction  for  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory.  Up
until  now  the  laboratory  has  been  left  rudderless  without  a  paddle.  Admiral  Cohen
has emphasized that he wants to maintain the intellectual capital of EML’s employ-
ees. Unfortunately, many of the lab’s cadre of scientists and engineers have already
retired or resigned since the lab was transferred into DHS. When the lab was trans-
ferred to DHS they had 54 employees, 12 with Ph.D.s and 18 with Master’s degrees.
Today  the  lab  has  35  employees,  seven  with  Ph.D.s  and  11  with  Master’s  degrees.
Damage to the intellectual capital of the laboratory has already occurred, but Admi-
ral Cohen can still help stem the flow.

The  S&T  Directorate—led  by  Admiral  Cohen—now  has  an  opportunity  to  clearly
lead the lab into the future by providing them with clear guidance, renewed encour-
agement  about  their  ability  to  contribute  to  the  Nation’s  security  and  by  obtaining
a  much  clearer  understanding  of  the  skills  and  abilities  of  the  lab’s  remaining  per-
sonnel  and  how  they  can  be  utilized  to  their  full  potential.  The  lab  has  been  left
to  wither  for  too  long,  staff  has  fled  and  critical  programs  have  been  inexplicably
terminated.  Admiral  Cohen  has  an  opportunity  to  curtail  the  damage  that  has  al-
ready been done and begin a positive path forward that will benefit the lab, its em-
ployees, DHS and the Nation.

Chairman  MILLER.  Good  morning.  The  Committee  will  come  to
order for the hearing on transitioning the Environmental Measure-
ments Laboratory to the Department of Homeland Security.

We  learned  from  Hurricane  Katrina  that  we  were  woefully  un-
prepared  for  an  entirely  foreseeable  natural  disaster.  The  failures
of  our  response  expose  the  sorry  state  of  our  emergency  prepared-
ness.  Many  of  us  wondered  what  else  was  suffering  from  similar
neglect  that  we  might  only  learn  of  if  something  goes  horribly
wrong?

Today  the  Subcommittee  is  going  to  review  the  management  of
the  Environmental  Measurements  Lab  by  the  Department  of
Homeland  Security’s  Science  and  Technology  Directorate.  It  ap-
pears that we have stunningly neglected our obvious national secu-
rity  and  homeland  security  need  to  detect  and  measure  radiation,
hindering our ability to respond to nuclear proliferation around the
world and here in the United States, to prevent and respond to the
detonation  of  a  dirty  bomb,  a  promise  that  terrorist  groups  have
telegraphed  for  years.  And  while  we  are  spending  billions  to  de-
velop the technology to intercept a missile in the air, to hit a bullet
with  a  bullet,  a  task  that  many  think  is  a  fool’s  errand,  we  have
shortchanged  research  to  develop  the  technology  to  prevent  a  nu-
clear  device  from  being  smuggled  into  the  United  States  and  deto-
nated in an American city, a far more likely event.

EML has specialized in radiation detection analysis for 60 years.
It  traces  its  roots  to  the  Manhattan  Project.  It  should  have  been
a welcome asset and a natural fit for an agency chartered with pro-
tecting  our  country  from  radiological  threats.  Instead,  detailed
plans to close the lab were concealed from both the EML staff and
Congress.  Critical  national  security  programs  at  the  lab  were  ter-
minated  and  the  lab’s  employees  to  be  left  to  wonder  about  their
future  for  the  past  four  years  without  any  clear  direction  or  deci-
sions from the Department of Homeland Security.

When  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  was  trans-
ferred  to  Homeland  Security  from  the  Department  of  Energy  in
2003,  Congress  expected  that  the  laboratory  would  add  value.  Be-
ginning  with  the  work  on  the  Manhattan  Project,  EML  scientists
developed a world-renown expertise in low-level radiation measure-
ment,  a  skill  that  would  be  of  critical  value  to  both  help  prevent
and respond to potential radiological or nuclear terrorist attack. In-
stead of exploring and expanding unique skills and the capabilities
of  the  laboratory  in  a  strategic  location  in  Manhattan,  Homeland
Security’s  S&T,  Science  and  Technology,  Directorate  soon  pro-
ceeded to reject the lab’s proposals for future work and terminated
its existing programs.

S&T  managers  downplayed,  dismissed,  disparaged  the  capabili-
ties  of  the  lab,  arguing  that  it  had  no  real  unique  skills,  had  low
credibility  in  the  view  of  local  first  responders,  and  could  not  com-
pete  with  other  larger  national  laboratories.  Our  first  panel  today
is  composed  of  local,  State  and  federal,  officials  and  a  former  DHS
manager. They will provide a contrary view to that assessment. We
will  also  examine  some  of  EML’s  key  programs  that  were  termi-
nated.  One  of  those  was  the  lab’s  worldwide  radiation  monitoring
program.

Beginning  in  1963,  EML  had  built  a  global  network  of  low-level
radiation sensors that were used by scientists to validate global at-
mospheric transport models. But the system also played a key role
in  nuclear  nonproliferation  efforts,  rapidly  identifying  any  new
sources  of  radiological  activities  from  nuclear  weapons  tests.  The
lab had installed two radiation monitors in China in 2002 and had
plans to install a new one, a new detector in China, near the North
Korean border, in early 2006. But on October 1, 2005, the program
was  terminated  by  DHS.  Almost  exactly  a  year  later,  on  October
9, 2006, North Korea carried out a nuclear weapons test. It is hard
to  know  how  valuable  the  EML’s  Global  Monitoring  Program,  and
particularly  its  new  radiation  sensor,  would  have  been  in  helping
determine  the  sophistication  of  the  North  Korean  nuclear  test.  We
only  know  that  because  of  DHS’s  action,  the  sensor  was  not  in
place and remains unassembled at EML today.

In  2005,  DHS  also  stripped  EML  of  its  radioisotope  chemical
analysis  labs,  critical  for  the  continuation  of  its  radiochemistry
Quality  Assessment  Program.  That  is  pronounced  QAP.  It  sounds
like Elmer Fudd using a mild profanity—QAP. It is praised by both
State and federal participants as directly contributing to homeland
security  efforts.  This  program  helped  ensure  the  results  produced
by  radiochemistry  tests  by  radiochemistry  labs,  whose  task  is  to
analyze  radioactive  samples  whether  from  a  nuclear  facility  or  in
response to radiological attack, were accurate.

Some  projects  EML  initiated  with  local  first  responders  in  New
York  City,  including  a  network  of  rooftop  radiation  sensors,  were
halted by DHS. Other programs were started and stopped and then
transferred. The way the EML has fared since being transferred to
DHS  shows  an  appalling  lack  of  leadership  at  DHS  S&T  Direc-
torate.  The  lack  of  clear  decisions  and  direction  regarding  EML
permitted  a  haphazard  approach  and  its  programs  to  fester  within
the S&T Directorate. And as a result, the lab’s programs were deci-
mated and its staff demoralized and a seemingly reckless disregard
for  how  the  lab’s  skills  and  projects  could  have  benefited  DHS,
other federal agencies or the Nation.

Top S&T managers responsible for terminating some of the lab’s
key  programs  had  no  idea  what  those  programs  actually  did  and
had no discussions about how they might benefit DHS. In addition,
S&T managers squandered an inordinate amount of time and effort
planning  for  the  demise  of  the  EML  laboratory,  rather  than  at-
tempting  to  determine  how  the  lab  might  be  effectively  used  and
its staff successfully employed to contribute to DHS. Because of all
of  these  actions,  the  lab  has  been  left  in  limbo.  Many  of  its  pro-
grams have been terminated, new projects halted, the skills and ca-
pabilities  of  its  employees  disparaged,  and  its  staff  reduced  by  a
third.

The  Subcommittee  hopes  that  EML  and  the  leadership  of  S&T
Directorate  have  turned  the  corner  and  we  can  now  expect  some
positive change in the future. Our last panel today will look at the
lab’s future role in DHS. The vast majority of those actions did not
occur  under  Under  Secretary  of  Science  and  Technology  Admiral
Cohen’s  watch.  The  Subcommittee  is  pleased  that  the  new  leader-
ship  of  the  S&T  Directorate  appears  willing  to  utilize  a  lab  that
many  have  referred  to  as  a  national  asset.  Again,  we  appreciate

that  the  S&T  Directorate  and  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Of-
fice will work together to employ fully the skills of the staff at the
Environmental Measurements Laboratory.

And  now  I  would  like  to  recognize  the  Ranking  Member,  Mr.

McCaul, for his opening statement.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Miller follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BRAD MILLER

Good morning.
We learned from Hurricane Katrina that we were woefully unprepared for an en-
tirely  foreseeable  natural  disaster.  The  failures  of  our  response  exposed  the  sorry
state of our emergency preparedness.

Many of us wondered what else was suffering from similar neglect that we might

only learn of if something else goes horribly wrong.

Today,  the  Subcommittee  is  going  to  review  management  of  the  Environmental
Measurements  Laboratory  (EML)  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s
Science & Technology Directorate. It appears that we have stunningly neglected our
obvious  national  security  and  homeland  security  need  to  detect  and  measure  radi-
ation,  hindering  our  ability  to  respond  to  nuclear  proliferation  around  the  world,
and  here  in  the  United  States  to  prevent  or  respond  to  the  detonation  of  a  ‘‘dirty
bomb,’’  a  punch  that  terrorist  groups  have  telegraphed  for  years.  And  while  we  are
spending billions to develop the technology to intercept a missile in the air, we have
shortchanged  research  to  develop  the  technology  to  prevent  a  nuclear  device  from
being  smuggled  into  the  United  States  and  detonated  in  an  American  city,  a  far
more likely event.

EML has specialized in radiation detection and analysis for 60 years. It traces its
roots  to  the  Manhattan  Project.  It  should  have  been  a  welcomed  asset  and  natural
fit  for  an  agency  charged  with  protecting  the  country  from  radiological  threats.  In-
stead,  detailed  plans  to  close  the  lab  were  concealed  from  both  the  EML  staff  and
Congress,  critical  national  security  programs  at  the  lab  were  terminated  and  the
lab’s  employees  have  been  left  to  ponder  their  future  fate  for  the  past  four  years
without any clear direction or decisions from DHS.

When the Environmental Measurements Laboratory was transferred to Homeland
Security from the Department of Energy in 2003, Congress expected that the labora-
tory  would  add  value.  Beginning  with  their  work  on  the  Manhattan  Project,  EML’s
scientists developed a world renowned expertise in low-level radiation measurement,
a skill that would be of critical value to both help prevent and respond to a potential
radiological or nuclear terrorist attack. But, instead of exploiting and expanding the
unique  skills  and  capabilities  of  the  laboratory  and  its  strategic  location  in  New
York  City,  Homeland  Security’s  S&T  Directorate  soon  proceeded  to  reject  the  lab’s
proposals for future work and terminated its existing programs.

S&T  managers  downplayed,  dismissed  and  disparaged  the  capabilities  of  the  lab
arguing that it had no unique skills, had low credibility in the view of the local first
responders it worked with and could not compete with other larger national labora-
tories.  Our  first  panel  today  is  composed  of  local,  State  and  federal  officials  and  a
former  DHS  program  manager.  They  will  provide  a  contrary  view  to  that  assess-
ment.

We  will  also  examine  some  of  EML’s  key  programs  that  were  inexplicably  termi-
nated.  One  of  those  was  the  lab’s  worldwide  radiation  monitoring  program.  Begin-
ning  in  1963,  EML  had  built  a  global  network  of  low-level  radiation  sensors  that
was used by scientists to validate global atmospheric transport models. But the sys-
tem  also  played  a  key  role  in  nuclear  non-proliferation  efforts,  rapidly  identifying
any  new  sources  of  radiological  activities  from  nuclear  weapons  tests.  The  lab  had
installed  two  radiation  monitors  in  China  in  2002  and  had  plans  to  install  a  new
detector  in  China  near  the  North  Korean  border  in  early  2006.  But  on  October  1,
2005, the program was terminated by DHS. Almost exactly a year later, on October
9,  2006,  North  Korea  carried  out  a  nuclear  weapons  test.  It  is  hard  to  know  how
valuable the EML global monitoring program and particularly its new radiation sen-
sor  that  the  lab  had  planned  to  install  near  the  North  Korean  border  would  have
been  in  helping  to  determine  the  sophistication  of  the  North  Korean  nuclear  test.
We  only  know  that,  because  of  DHS’s  actions,  the  sensor  was  not  in  place  and  sits
unassembled at EML today.

In 2005, DHS also stripped EML of its radioisotope chemical analysis labs critical
for  the  continuation  of  its  radiochemistry  Quality  Assessment  Program  (QAP)
praised  by  both  State  and  federal  participants  as  directly  contributing  to  homeland
security  efforts.  This  program  helped  ensure  that  the  results  produced  by

radiochemistry  labs—whose  task  is  to  analyze  radioactive  samples  whether  from  a
nuclear  facility  or  in  response  to  a  radiological  attack—are  accurate.  Some  projects
EML initiated with local first responders in New York City, including a network of
roof-top  radiation  sensors,  were  halted  by  DHS.  Other  programs  were  started,
stopped and then transferred.

The  incomprehensible  way  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  has
fared since being transferred to DHS is testimony to an appalling lack of leadership
at  the  S&T  Directorate.  The  lack  of  clear  decisions  and  direction  regarding  EML
permitted  a  haphazard  approach  to  the  EML  and  its  programs  to  fester  within  the
S&T  Directorate.  As  a  result,  the  lab’s  programs  were  decimated  and  its  staff  de-
moralized  with  a  seemingly  reckless  disregard  for  how  the  lab’s  skills  and  projects
could have benefited DHS, other federal agencies or the Nation as a whole. Top S&T
managers  responsible  for  terminating  some  of  the  lab’s  key  programs  had  no  idea
what these programs actually did and held no discussions on how they might benefit
DHS. In addition, S&T managers squandered an inordinate amount of time and ef-
fort planning for the demise of the Environmental Measurements Laboratory rather
than  attempting  to  determine  how  the  lab  could  be  effectively  utilized  and  its  staff
successfully employed to contribute to DHS.

Because of all of these actions, the lab has been left in a disturbing state of limbo.
Many of its programs have been terminated, new projects halted, the skills and ca-
pabilities of its federal employees disparaged and its staff reduced by one-third. The
Subcommittee hopes that the EML and the leadership at the S&T Directorate have
finally turned the corner and that we can expect positive change to be forthcoming.
Our  last  panel  will  look  towards  the  lab’s  future  role  in  DHS.  The  vast  majority
of  these  actions  did  not  occur  under  Under  Secretary  of  Science  &  Technology,  Ad-
miral  Cohen’s  watch.  The  Subcommittee  is  pleased  that  the  new  leadership  at  the
S&T  Directorate  appears  willing  to  utilize  a  laboratory  that  many  have  referred  to
as  a  national  asset.  We  anticipate  that  the  S&T  Directorate  and  the  Domestic  Nu-
clear Detection Office will work together to fully employ and exploit the skills of the
staff at the Environmental Measurements Laboratory.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Miller.  As  I  said,  it  is  your
lucky  day.  I  am  filling  in  for  Mr.  Sensenbrenner  today.  I  want  to
welcome  our  witnesses  and  those  out  there.  I  want  to  thank  the
Chairman for holding this hearing on the Department of Homeland
Security’s Environmental Measurements Laboratory.

As  the  Ranking  Member  on  the  Homeland  Security  Committee’s
Subcommittee  on  Emerging  Threats,  Cybersecurity,  and  Science
and  Technology,  I  am  particularly  interested  in  the  future  of  the
Department’s  national  labs.  To  that  end,  I  hope  the  witnesses  be-
fore  us  today  can  help  us  understand  what  EML’s  capabilities  are
and  how  they  can  best  fit  into  DHS.  Any  time  a  facility  is  trans-
ferred  from  one  agency  to  another,  there  is  understandably  a  re-
alignment  of  work  in  order  to  serve  the  agency’s  and  the  Nation’s
best interest. EML is no exception. They will have to adapt to their
new  homeland  security  mission,  which  will  likely  mean  a  different
focus  and  direction  for  the  lab.  In  identifying  this  new  path,  we
should  also  be  mindful  of  other  work  EML  does  that  may  not  be
in  line  within  the  DHS  structure  and  mission  and  make  sure  that
we  don’t  lose  a  national  capability  just  because  of  turf  consider-
ations.

That  being  said,  I  am  confident  that  there  is  a  safe  place  for
EML in DHS, after all, EML is a unique asset located in the heart
of  downtown  Manhattan.  They  have  built  up  a  strong  relationship
with State and local entities there and are undisputedly experts in
low-level  radiation  analysis,  clearly  a  high  priority  for  DHS.  As  I
said,  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony.  I  hope  this  will  be  a  produc-
tive hearing and we will leave here with a better understanding of
how EML can best be utilized in the future. And with that, I yield
back, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you, Mr. Miller. I will be filling in for Mr. Sensenbrenner today as Ranking
Member.  I  want  to  welcome  our  witnesses  here  today  and  thank  the  Chairman  for
holding  this  hearing  on  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  Environmental
Measurements  Laboratory.  As  the  Ranking  Member  on  the  Homeland  Security
Committee’s  Subcommittee  on  Emerging  Threats,  Cyber  Security,  and  Science  and
Technology,  I’m  particularly  interested  in  the  future  of  the  Department’s  national
labs.

To  that  end,  I  hope  the  witnesses  before  us  today  can  help  us  understand  what
EML’s  capabilities  are,  and  how  they  can  best  fit  into  DHS.  Anytime  a  facility  is
transferred  from  one  agency  to  another,  there  is  understandably  a  realignment  of
work in order to serve the agency’s, and the Nation’s, best interests. EML is no dif-
ferent.  They  will  have  to  adapt  to  their  new  homeland  security  mission,  which  will
likely mean a different focus and direction for the lab. In identifying this new path,
we  should  also  be  mindful  of  other  work  EML  does  that  may  not  be  aligned  with
the  DHS  mission  and  make  sure  that  we  don’t  lose  a  national  capability  just  be-
cause of turf considerations.

That  being  said,  I  am  confident  that  there  is  a  place  for  EML  in  DHS.  After  all,
EML  is  a  unique  asset:  Located  in  the  heart  of  Manhattan,  they  have  built  up
strong  relationships  with  State  and  local  entities,  and  are  undisputedly  experts  in
low-level  radiation  analysis—clearly  a  high  priority  for  DHS.  I  look  forward  to  all
of our witnesses’ testimony—particularly Under Secretary Cohen’s and Mr. Oxford’s.
I hope this will be a productive hearing, and that we will all leave here with a bet-
ter understanding of how EML can best be utilized in the future.

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  McCaul.  If  there  are  other
Members—Mr. Rothman is welcome to submit any kind of opening
statement  for  the  record,  which  he  has  shaken  his  head  to  show
that he does not.

Mr. ROTHMAN. If I may, Mr. Chairman, let me say that I am very

interested in today’s hearing, period.

Chairman  MILLER.  The  Chairman  welcomes  similar  opening

statements from the Members of the Committee.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER JR.

SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT

RANKING MEMBER

Sensenbrenner Lauds Value of

Environmental Measurements Laboratories

Washington, May 3, 2007—As the Ranking Republican on the House Science and
Technology Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, Representative Jim Sen-
senbrenner  (R–MI)  made  the  following  comments  following  today’s  Subcommittee
hearing  on  Environmental  Measurement  Laboratories  (EML),  and  its  transition
from the Department of Energy to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS):

‘‘If an American city was a victim of a dirty bomb attack, our lack of preparedness
would affect our ability to triage medical care and limit panic,’’ said Sensenbrenner.
‘‘Proper  equipment  and  training  would  allow  experts  to  quickly  assess  and  disclose
the  levels  of  radiation  and  the  risk  to  the  public,  allowing  people  who  are  not  at
risk  to  be  put  at  ease  and  freeing  emergency  responders  to  focus  on  those  people
most in need of care.’’

‘‘After  a  Subcommittee  investigation  that  has  spanned  the  past  several  months,
it  is  clear  that  DHS  has,  thus  far,  struggled  to  fully  realize  the  value  of  EML’s  ex-
pertise,’’  Sensenbrenner  continued.  ‘‘It  is  equally  clear  that  EML,  which  specializes
in low-level radiation measurements, can have a valuable place within DHS and can
help prepare America to respond to a catastrophic attack.’’

A supervisor with the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, Lynn West, worked
with EML through its Quality Assessment Program (QAP) before that program was
terminated  by  DHS.  Ms.  West  explained  that  while  America  has  done  a  lot  to  pre-
pare  for  a  full-scale  nuclear  disaster,  it  has  lagged  in  its  preparedness  to  respond
to lower-level radiological emergencies, like a dirty bomb.

‘‘There  is  currently  no  program,  federal  or  otherwise,  focused  on  developing  the
ability  of  radiochemistry  labs  to  respond  to  radiological  emergencies.  The  QAP  pro-
gram,  had  it  not  been  terminated,  would  have  helped  in  this  area,’’  Sensenbrenner
concluded.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  morning.  Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman  for  calling  this  hearing  to  receive  testi-
mony  from  witnesses  on  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s  (DHS)’s  Science
and Technology Directorate Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML).

In the 1970s, EML established a radiochemistry quality assessment program that
grew to include the participation of more than 150 labs. They have provided a sup-
port  role  for  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Nuclear  Emergency  Search  Teams,  whose
task is to locate and disable nuclear weapons or radiological dispersal devices in the
U.S. and abroad.

EML  was  transferred  from  the  Department  of  Energy  to  the  DHS’s  Science  and
Technology Directorate in 2003, under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Since its
transfer  to  DHS,  programs  at  EML  have  been  terminated  and  curtailed  in  order  to
plan  for  the  lab’s  ultimate  closure.  The  reasons  for  shutting  down  the  lab  are  not
clear and the Science and Technology Directorate within the DHS has not provided
an explanation to Congress or the public of the rationale for closure.

I look forward to hearing from our panel of witnesses in order to obtain full disclo-
sure  on  what  happened  with  the  EML  and  why  Congress  was  not  made  aware  of
the  systemic  mismanagement  that  occurred  in  supervising,  managing,  and  leading
the laboratory.

Chairman  MILLER.  We  would  now  like  to  introduce  our  panel  of
witnesses. On the first panel is Mr. Charles McBrearty, former Di-
rector  of  Materials  Technology,  Air  Force  Technical  Applications
Center,  Patrick  Air  Force  Base  in  Florida;  Dr.  Tony  Fainberg,
former  Program  Manager,  Radiological  and  Nuclear  Counter-
measures,  Office  of  Research  and  Development,  Science  and  Tech-
nology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security; Lynn Albin,
Radiation Health Specialist or Physicist, Office of Radiation Protec-
tion, Washington State Department of Health; and Assistant Com-
missioner Jonathan Duecker with the New York Police Department
Counterterrorism Bureau. You can all take your seats. Thank you.
Your  oral  testimony  is  limited  to  five  minutes.  All  of  you  have
submitted written testimony which will be placed in the record and
without objection, we may enter various documents in the hearing,
whether  identified  or  not  during  the  hearing.  I  assume  that  is
without  objection.  So  after  the  entire  panel  has  given  your  five-
minute  testimony,  the  Members  of  the  Committee  will  have  five
minutes  each  to  ask  questions.  I  will  try  to  be  fairly  strict  about
that, although Mr. McCaul has not been an offender in that regard.
And  we  do  swear  the  witnesses,  so  it  is  our  practice  to  do  so.  Do
any  of  you  have  any  objections  to  being  sworn  in,  to  taking  an
oath? You also have the right to be represented by Counsel. I know
hearing that does not necessarily put you at your ease. There is no
reason.  None  of  us  anticipate  that  you  need  Counsel,  but  you  may
have  Counsel  if  you  want  it  and  none  of  you  have  Counsel  today.
Okay,  if  you  would  all  now  please  stand  and  raise  your  right

hand.

may begin.

Panel 1:

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  CHARLES  F.  MCBREARTY,  JR.,  FORMER
DIRECTOR  OF  MATERIALS  TECHNOLOGY,  AIR  FORCE  TECH-
NICAL APPLICATIONS CENTER, PATRICK AIR FORCE BASE
Mr.  MCBREARTY.  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  represent  the
Air  Force  Technical  Applications  Center  (AFTAC)  at  this  hearing
on the transition of EML. A detailed response to the questions you
asked  me,  sir,  is  in  the  written  testimony  that  I  provided.  I  will
just  give  a  quick  summary  of  some  of  those  points  and  would  be
happy to answer and elaborate.

The  mission  of  AFTAC  is  to  provide  the  national  authorities
quality  technical  measurements  to  monitor  nuclear  treaty  compli-
ance by foreign nations, and to develop advanced proliferation tech-
nologies  which  are  vital  to  the  national  security.  In  terms  of  this
Committee’s  inquiry,  AFTAC  had  maintained  an  outstanding  rela-
tionship  with  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  for  al-
most  four  decades.  In  2005,  when  Dr.  Clarke  of  DHS  informed
AFTAC  that  EML  would  be  closing,  I  traveled  to  the  DHS  offices
to personally discuss the matter with him. My purpose was to em-
phasize  the  importance  of  the  work  that  EML  was  doing  for
AFTAC,  as  well  as  my  view  of  the  potential  value,  an  important
value EML represented to the new department.

The  DHS  decision  did  not  change  as  a  result  of  that  mission
meeting,  so  AFTAC  proceeded  to  transfer  its  nuclear  monitoring
support functions, which we’re doing on at EML, to Los Alamos Na-
tional  Laboratories  and  its  engineering  and  nuclear  analysis  sam-
pling  technology  evaluation  support  functions  to  Pacific  Northwest
Laboratories,  two  laboratories  which,  again,  we  have  had  and  do
have long-term relationships with.

The termination of AFTAC’s efforts at EML created a short-term
impact  on  our  programs  during  the  transfer  of  the  analysis  work
to the other laboratories. Based on the DHS decisions, we adjusted
our  operations  and  today  are  generally  comfortable  with  the  new
arrangements.  Because  of  this  decision,  or  the  threat  of  it,  key
EML  staff  scientists  have  moved  on  or  retired  and  specialized
equipment  has  been  transferred.  Thus  the  core  of  the  capability  of
great value to AFTAC no longer currently exists at EML.

From  my  position  as  a  customer  of  EML  and  versed  and  experi-
enced  with  about  38  or  so  years  in  this  field,  I  believe  that  the  in-
tangible worth of EML’s excellent technical experience and contacts
within  the  international  radiation  measurements  community  were
not  fully  appreciated.  We  did  appreciate  them  and  made  great  use
of all of those contacts in matters like the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and things of that nature.

However,  that  said,  the  ultimate  decision  of  whether  or  not  to
continue  EML’s  operations  was  one  ultimately  DHS  had  to  make.
Our  operations  only  funded  a  small  portion  of  the  work  that  went
on  there,  so  we  had  no  choice  once  the  decision  was  apparently
made to terminate other than to move on, move our stuff onwards.
If you have any other questions, I will be happy to answer them.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHARLES F. MCBREARTY, JR.

Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of the Committee, I appreciate this oppor-
tunity  to  represent  the  Air  Force  Technical  Applications  Center  (AFTAC)  at  this
hearing on the transition of the Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) to
the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS).  The  mission  of  AFTAC  is  to  provide
national authorities quality technical measurements to monitor nuclear treaty com-
pliance and develops advanced proliferation monitoring technologies to preserve our
nation’s  security.  In  terms  of  this  committee’s  inquiry,  AFTAC  had  a  long  and  val-
ued  association  with  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  going  back  over
three  decades.  During  that  period,  EML  provided  services  to  AFTAC  through  the
Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  ‘‘Work  of  Others  Program.’’  These  efforts  consisted  of
task-order based, technical support and consulting services associated with the area
of  their  expertise,  the  measurement  of  radioactivity  in  the  environment.  EML  also
provided AFTAC with assistance on other national security projects that we will not
be able to discuss in today’s open hearing.
EML Program Support to AFTAC

At  the  time  the  EML  was  transferred  to  the  DHS,  we  were  maintaining  a  rel-
atively small effort (on the order of $200K–$300K per year) with the laboratory. The
focus of that work was largely for trace radionuclide analysis of specific samples col-
lected  by  the  United  States  Atomic  Energy  Detection  System  (USAEDS)  operated
by AFTAC. EML performed this analysis on gas samples collected by AFTAC’s Nu-
clear Debris Collection and Analysis (NDC&A) program to monitor provisions of the
Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963.

In addition, AFTAC made good use of EML’s scientific expertise and excellent con-
nections/reputation  in  the  International  Community.  We  routinely  asked  their  ad-
vice,  support,  and  assistance  in  tasks  associated  with  the  enhancement  of  the
USAEDS,  innovative  sampler  design  and  development,  and  consulted  closely  on
matters  of  common  interest  with  regard  to  the  Comprehensive  Test  Ban  Treaty
(CTBT).

During  development  of  CTBT  protocols  in  the  mid  1990’s  AFTAC,  strongly  rec-
ommended that EML be designated as the U.S. ‘‘States Party’’ radionuclide analysis
laboratory. They were subsequently so designated.

Dr.  John  Clarke  of  the  DHS  notified  AFTAC  in  September  2005  that,  ‘‘Our  year-
long  review  has  now  concluded  and  the  programmatic  decision  has  been  made  to
close  the  EML.’’  He  also  informed  EML  and  AFTAC  that  the  DHS  would  no  longer
accept funding for this work. Dr. Clarke noted in that e-mail that he had contacted
both Mr. Scott Smith, the AFTAC Project Officer, and I and stated, ‘‘They both un-
derstand and accept that the nature of future radiation measurement work at EML
is  still  under  review  in  DHS  and  that  DHS  cannot  commit  to  a  new  contract  with
their  organization  at  this  time.’’  AFTAC  worked  with  EML  over  the  next  seven
months to relocate the government furnished equipment needed to perform our nu-
clear treaty monitoring mission to Los Alamos National Laboratory. AFTAC also as-
sisted  EML  in  relocating  their  sample  inventory  to  qualified  sample  management
facilities  at  AFTAC  and  AFTAC-sponsored  laboratory  facilities  at  Los  Alamos  Na-
tional Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
Value of EML Activities to AFTAC and Support to National Security

We highly valued the work of EML. Not only was the laboratory a reputable and
highly respected analytical facility from whom we could always count on quality and
cost  effective  work,  they  were  unmatched  in  their  understanding  of  the  operational
realities of sample collection operations. The culture that had evolved at the labora-
tory was, in my view, one of seeking practical, rugged and sustainable collection sys-
tems and collection concepts.

Again,  we  cannot  go  into  the  details  of  the  national  security  work  performed  by
EML  in  this  environment.  While  we  had  significantly  reduced  the  amount  of  na-
tional security work being performed by EML under this portion of the effort, some
aspects were quite valuable to the USAEDS treaty monitoring efforts.

The  engineering  and  nuclear  debris  sampling  and  radiometric  technology  evalua-
tion support was of high value to AFTAC. The EML scientists, as federal employees,
were  noted  for  impartial  and  independent  judgment  on  nuclear  measurement  re-
lated issues.

The radiometric measurements on gas samples collected by AFTAC’s NDC&A pro-
gram  were  of  very  high  value  to  AFTAC.  Many  of  the  national  laboratories  could
perform these types of radiometric measurements, but EML was unique in its prox-
imity to our gas sample processing laboratory in New Providence, NJ. Samples could
be  driven  to  EML  in  less  than  an  hour  if  required  and  time  is  often  of  the  essence
for measuring the short lived isotopes associated with nuclear weapons testing.

AFTAC’s Efforts to Persuade DHS to Maintain EML Programs

16

I  was  initially  quite  pleased  to  learn  that  a  decision  had  been  made  to  transfer
EML  to  the  DHS.  My  organization  and  I  highly  regarded  the  expertise  and  com-
petence  of  EML  in  the  field  of  trace  radionuclide  detection,  and  I  believed  those
same  capabilities  that  were  of  such  value  to  AFTAC  could  also  be  of  great  help  to
the  new  Department.  EML’s  excellent  national  and  international  reputation  in  a
field  of  critical  need  by  DHS  (trace  radioactive  materials  detection  and  expertise  in
sample  collection,  data  analysis  and  quality  control)  were,  in  my  mind,  extremely
valuable assets.

I  was  surprised  when  I  learned  that  closure  of  the  laboratory  was  being  consid-
ered.  When  we  received  clear  indication  from  the  new  program  office  in  DHS  that
closure  was  planned,  I  made  a  special  trip  to  Washington  to  discuss  the  issue,  its
implications for my programs, and expressed my opinion of the inherent value EML
capabilities represented to DHS.

During  this  visit  in  September  2005,  I  meet  with  Dr.  John  Clarke  and  discussed
these  topics.  Dr.  Clarke  indicated  that  actions  were  underway  to  close  the  lab  and
that  unless  we  wanted  to  pick  up  the  tab  for  the  operation,  (a  sum  of  about  $10M
per year as I recall), we should plan on moving our work elsewhere. I expressed my
surprise at the proposed decision and emphasized my view that a credible, unbiased
resource for testing, reviewing, and quality control of the plethora of radiation detec-
tion concepts being pushed by numerous commercial enterprises as well as the Na-
tional  Laboratories  themselves. . .capabilities  I  believed  resided  in  EML. . .was
critically needed.

DHS’s response to my points was that ‘‘EML was quite costly and did not fit into

their ‘Business Model’.’’
AFTAC’s Response to DHS’s Decision to Halt EML Support to AFTAC

After being notified of the DHS programmatic decision to close EML, AFTAC con-
sidered  a  number  of  possible  alternatives  to  continue  the  national  security  portion
of  the  effort.  Dr.  Clarke  offered  to  assist  AFTAC  in  finding  an  organization  within
the Federal Government that could take over this effort. Based upon the new capa-
bilities, either already in place or scheduled for being operational with the next two
years, AFTAC decided to terminate the national security effort rather than attempt-
ing to transition that effort to another organization.

The majority of the remaining engineering and nuclear debris sampling and radio-
metric  technology  evaluation  support  transitioned  to  Pacific  Northwest  National
Laboratory,  another  long-term  USAEDS  mission  partner  for  AFTAC.  This  work  is
sponsored by both AFTAC and the DOE Office of Nonproliferation Research and De-
velopment. AFTAC particularly valued the ability to consult with EML as an honest
broker  for  engineering  advice  and  technical  evaluation.  AFTAC  successfully
transitioned the gas sample radiometric measurement effort to Los Alamos National
Laboratory, a long-term USAEDS mission partner for AFTAC, in the spring of 2006.
EML requested permission to discontinue operating and maintaining these systems,
and AFTAC approved this request on 14 March 2006. Personnel from EML and Los
Alamos  packed  up  the  detectors  and  other  Air  Force  government-furnished  equip-
ment and shipped them to Los Alamos in late April 2006.
Conclusion

AFTAC  had  maintained  an  outstanding  relationship  with  the  Environmental
Measurements  Laboratory  for  four  decades.  When  Dr.  John  Clarke,  DHS,  informed
AFTAC  that  DHS  would  be  closing  EML,  I  traveled  to  DHS  to  personally  discuss
the matter with him. The DHS decision did not change as a result of that meeting,
so  AFTAC  proceeded  to  transfer  its  nuclear  treaty  monitoring  support  functions  to
Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory  and  its  engineering  and  nuclear  debris  sampling
and  radiometric  technology  evaluation  support  functions  to  Pacific  Northwest  Na-
tional Laboratory. AFTAC terminated its support for the national security work due
to increased capabilities elsewhere and other priorities.

The  termination  of  AFTAC  efforts  at  EML  created  short-term  impact  on  our  pro-
gram  during  the  transfer  of  analysis  work  to  other  laboratories.  Based  on  the  DHS
decisions,  we  adjusted  our  operations  and  today  are  generally  comfortable  with  the
new arrangements. Because of this decision (or threat of it), key EML scientific staff
have moved on or retired and specialized equipment has been transferred. Thus, the
core of the capability of value to AFTAC no longer exists at EML.

From my position as a customer of EML’s, I believe the intangible worth of EML’s
excellent technical experience and contacts within the international radiation meas-
urements  community  was  not  fully  appreciated.  From  AFTAC’s  perspective,  this
was  important,  and  in  my  view  was,  in  many  ways,  a  unique  national  asset  rep-
resenting an experience base unlike any other laboratory in the DOE complex. How-

ever,  in  the  larger  picture,  DHS  as  the  parent  agency,  the  primary  designated  cus-
tomer of EML’s output and the agency which was funding the bulk of EML’s activi-
ties was better positioned than we, as occasional users, were to make the final fund-
ing decision. Ultimately, we—AFTAC—made our own decision as to whether or not
to  support  a  wider  range  of  activities  than  we  had  historically  supported  in  order
to  keep  EML  together,  and  we,  too,  decided  that  we  couldn’t  provide  that  level  of
support.

Thank you for your attention. If you have any questions, I would be happy to ad-

dress them.

BIOGRAPHY FOR CHARLES F. MCBREARTY, JR.

Charles  F.  McBrearty,  Jr.,  retired  as  the  Director  of  Materials  Technology  at  the
Air  Force  Technical  Applications  Center  (AFTAC),  Patrick  Air  Force  Base,  Florida
on  30  April  2007.  Prior  to  his  retirement,  Mr.  McBrearty  directed  AFTAC’s  largest
product  area  with  an  annual  program  budget  of  more  than  $140  million  and  di-
rected the work of over 200 scientific and engineering personnel. He was responsible
for the management of a network of 13 analytical laboratories engaged in trace nu-
clear and non-nuclear materials analysis, in support of AFTAC’s global treaty-moni-
toring  tasking  to  detect,  collect,  and  analyze  nuclear  material  associated  with  nu-
clear  tests.  He  guided  AFTAC’s  research  and  development  programs  exploring  new
technologies  to  enhance  and  assist  treaty  verification  and  efforts  to  limit  the  pro-
liferation  of  nuclear,  chemical  and  biological  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  His  re-
sponsibilities  covered  diverse  sciences  and  technologies  ranging  from  nuclear  engi-
neering,  chemistry,  and  meteorology,  to  collection  and  analysis  technique  develop-
ment.  Mr.  McBrearty  directed  AFTAC  nuclear  analysis  and  evaluation  support  to
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Department of State, in their mon-
itoring of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

Mr. McBrearty has served in a variety of leadership, academic and technical posi-
tions  in  government  and  industry.  He  entered  the  Air  Force  in  1967  as  a  distin-
guished  graduate  of  the  Texas  A&M  University  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps
(ROTC) program and served as a commissioned officer until 1991.

He  held  two  command  positions  with  AFTAC,  taught  at  the  Air  Force  Academy,
and served in numerous staff and scientific positions. Following his retirement from
active  duty,  he  managed  NASA’s  Toxic  Vapor  Detection  Laboratory  supporting
Space Shuttle operations at Kennedy Space Center.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  M.  ANTHONY  FAINBERG,  FORMER  PRO-
GRAM  MANAGER,  RADIOLOGICAL  AND  NUCLEAR  COUNTER-
MEASURES,  OFFICE  OF  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT,
SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY  DIRECTORATE,  DEPARTMENT
OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Dr.  FAINBERG.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Congressman  McCaul,  thank
you and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity
to  discuss  my  experiences  with  EML  and  my  views  on  that  lab
today.  I  wish  first  to  state  that  while  I  happen  to  be  adjunct  staff
member  at  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses,  my  views  are  en-
tirely personal and no way reflect any positions taken by that orga-
nization.  I  will  try  quickly  to  cover  several  topics  requested  by
Committee staff.

My background and training is as an experimental physicist and
I recently retired from the government after 20 years of service. In
2003,  for  the  first  few  months  at  DHS,  I  was  responsible  for  both
administrative  and  programmatic  oversight  of  EML  and  the  DHS
Office  of  Research  and  Development  within  the  S&T  Directorate.

Later on, I managed radiation detection and explosive detection re-
search at national labs and at EML.

While  at  DHS,  I  visited  the  lab  several  times  to  learn  about  its
history  and  resources.  Its  work  had  been  mainly  in  the  area  of
radiochemistry  and  low-level  radiation  measurements.  There  was
some  mismatch  between  some  of  their  activities  and  DHS  needs,
but  I  judged  that,  in  the  field  of  radiation  detection,  their  experi-
ence  would  be  useful  for  DHS.  My  initial  assessment  was  that  the
lab  space  was  in  sad  condition,  rented  from  GSA  at  far  too  high  a
price.  There  were  60  staff  members,  down  from  over  a  hundred
some years earlier. DOE had left the lab as a neglected backwater,
perhaps  because  of  DOE’s  recently  declining  emphasis  on  environ-
mental cleanup, which had become the lab’s chief area of responsi-
bility.  However,  although  the  lab  had  been  in  decline,  staff  wel-
comed  and  indeed  embraced  the  chance  for  a  rebirth  as  part  of  a
mission  in  which  they  held  a  strong  and  vital  interest.  Located
about  a  mile  north  of  the  World  Trade  Center,  they  were  strongly
and viscerally affected by 9/11 and were extremely motivated to be-
come part of the global anti-terrorism effort.

Regarding the staff, some had been employed a task that had not
changed  much  for  decades  and  appeared  ready  for  retirement.  On
the  other  hand,  a  large  fraction  of  the  technical  staff,  of  varied
ages, impressed me as highly motivated, energetic and very capable
in  their  areas  of  expertise.  Upon  moving  to  DHS,  EML  manage-
ment  had  transitioned  their  work  to  projects  that  it  felt  would  be
useful  to  and  welcomed  by  DHS.  One  example  of  this  activity  was
a New York area science and tech working group which held semi-
nars for first responders in the area on radiation and operating ra-
diation detection equipment. I learned later from some participants
that these sessions were well attended and appreciated.

I found several projects to be of interest. They are written about
more  in  my  remarks,  but  one  that  particularly  struck  me  was  an
experiment  related  to  the  so-called  neutron  ship  effect,  carried  out
by  a  physicist  of  national  stature,  Dr.  Paul  Goldhagen.  This  in-
volved measurements of neutrons generated by cosmic rays striking
large  structures  such  as  ships.  It  was  directly  relevant  to  deter-
mining whether it would be useful to try to detect nuclear material
in containers bound for the United States on cargo ships.

Overall,  I  would  like  to  make  one  comment.  Since,  upon  its  cre-
ation,  the  S&T  Directorate  had  willingly  accepted  EML  as  part  of
its  new  organization,  it  was  clearly  incumbent  on  S&T  manage-
ment  to  establish  that  lab’s  new  mission.  In  fact,  one  would  have
thought  S&T  would  have  had  some  idea  of  how  the  lab  would  be
useful  to  them  before  agreeing  to  accept  them.  However,  I  saw  lit-
tle evidence that serious thought had been given to this matter. In-
deed,  after  a  year  or  two,  I  heard  grumbling  in  headquarters  that
EML  had  no  idea  of  what  its  mission  should  be,  as  though  this
were not the responsibility of S&T itself.

Committee  staff  have  asked  me  to  explain  why  I  resigned  from
S&T. The matter is not that important, except that the reasons re-
veal  some  existence  of  management  issues  and  without  going  into
too many details, I had some disagreements with Dr. John Clarke,
who  was  supposed  to  be  responsible  for  facility  management,  over
projects  at  EML.  After  a  series  of  meetings  with  him,  I  suggested

that he manage the programs himself, except for those that had al-
ready  been  approved  at  a  higher  level  by  the  Office  Director  of
ORD. He agreed but shortly thereafter he came to me and tried to
block  this  neutron  ship  effect  project,  for  which  I  had  a  certain
amount of interest and respect. I had asked my management after
that for—well, I appealed to my management after that for help be-
cause  they  had  previously  approved  that  project  and  my  manage-
ment  chain  was  entirely  deaf  to  my  e-mails,  all  of  them,  except  at
one  point  the  Deputy  Office  Director,  Robert  Hooks,  told  me  that
we should fix the matter ourselves.

Since  they  ignored  my  pleas  to  reaffirm  their  earlier  commit-
ments  on  this  project,  and  since  I  was  having  a  very  difficult  time
keeping  other  projects  there  alive  and  functioning,  I  submitted  my
resignation,  deciding  that  management  was  broken.  Management
proved later to me, three days, that it was broken, because my im-
mediate supervisor, Dr. Gerald Parker, came to me and handed me
a letter of counseling, which was a reprimand, for daring to resign
and  then  he  threatened  me  with  sanctions  if  I  continued  such  bad
behavior. This divorcement from reality, I thought, was noteworthy
and complete.

Naturally, I left ORD as soon as I could, within about two work-
ing days, I think it was, and was able, fortunately, to join the DHS
Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  for  my  remaining  federal  serv-
ice, where I found the working environment quite satisfactory. The
ship  project  went  forward  eventually,  but  it  is  kind  of  interesting
that I had to be forced to resign to accomplish this.

From  my  perspective,  I  concluded,  then,  that  S&T  management
was  trying  to  squeeze  EML  out  of  existence  by  turning  off  or  crip-
pling  projects,  one  by  one,  so  that  it  could  be  finally  asserted  that
the lab had no function. I do not know why this was done. Several
other  projects  I  had  thought  useful  had  also  been  rejected  earlier
by  my  superiors.  I  cannot  prove  there  was  an  overt  intent  to  close
the lab. Indeed, Mr. Hooks assured me, at this time, that such was
not the case. However, in spite of such an assurance, the facts indi-
cated  to  me  that  an  intention  to  shut  down  the  lab  was  the  sim-
plest explanation for what was going on.

My view is that S&T should have realized it was fortunate in ac-
quiring  an  asset  in  New  York  City,  which  is  a  prime  terrorist  tar-
get.  The  lab  had,  on  its  own,  established  excellent  working  rela-
tions  with  city  officials  and  could  have  functioned  as  S&T’s  pres-
ence in the area and these relations could have facilitated commu-
nication and cooperation between federal and State and local home-
land security officials, at least in the radiological arena. This oppor-
tunity  to  take  advantage  of  a  ready-made  local  asset  was  unfortu-
nately missed by S&T.

As  to  what  should  have  been  done  with  EML,  my  suggestions
would  have  been  to  allow  it  to  continue  some  of  the  local  projects
in  which  it  had  been  engaged.  I  would  have  supported  continual
global  monitoring,  thinking  that,  in  2004,  it  was  not  impossible
that  it  might  be  useful  to  have  some  detectors  near  North  Korea.
I  would  have  had  it  fully  engaged  in  supporting  the  rest  of  DHS
and  the  local  radiological  projects.  And  finally,  I  would  have  au-
thorized the hiring of some young scientists with recent degrees to
reinvigorate what had been a leading radiation laboratory some 20

to 30 years earlier. Briefly, I would have decided that, although the
lab  had  some  issues  that  needed  to  be  fixed,  it  would  have  been
worthwhile  rebuilding  it  into  a  high-profile  DHS  S&T  facility  in
New York. It may be too late for some of these thrusts, but on the
whole,  the  lab  still  can  and  should  be  resuscitated.  I  am  very  glad
to learn that finally this may happen.

To  save  time,  I  have  dropped  some  other  remarks  from  my  oral
presentation  regarding  another  S&T  lab,  the  Transportation  Secu-
rity  Lab  in  Atlantic  City,  with  which  I  have  some  acquaintance
over a decade or two. This lab is the Nation’s premier source of ex-
pertise  in  explosives  detection  and  in  development  of  detection
equipment,  particularly  regarding  aviation  security.  Practically  ev-
erything you see in terms of security equipment at U.S. and many
foreign  airports  has  been  developed  at  that  lab.  This  lab  has  suf-
fered  from  devastating  institutional  buffeting  since  9/11,  transfer-
ring between agencies twice, having its budget rocket up by factors
of  two  and  three  and  then  drop  by  factors  of  four.  I  feel  we  may
be in danger of losing this major national asset that helps protects
us from terrorist attack.

I  would  be  happy  to  respond  to  questions  about  this  lab  as  well

as about EML. Thank you for your attention.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Fainberg follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF M. ANTHONY FAINBERG

Mr.  Chairman,  Congressman  Sensenbrenner,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
discuss my experiences with the Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) in
New  York  City,  as  an  official  who  was  present  at  the  stand-up  of  the  Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) on March 1, 2003.

I  had  actually  begun  work  with  the  predecessor  of  the  Science  and  Technology
(S&T)  Directorate—the  Transition  Planning  Office  (TPO)—a  few  months  before
stand-up,  in  December  2002.  At  the  time  I  began  work  there,  I  had  over  17  years
of experience in government. I had been an analyst, in areas where science and na-
tional security policy intersect, and a program manager, overseeing research and de-
velopment  programs  for  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  and  the  Defense
Threat Reduction Agency. As an analyst for the former Congressional Office of Tech-
nology  Assessment,  I  had,  in  1990–1991,  written  the  first  detailed  analysis  of  the
potential  uses  of  technology  in  countering  terrorism.  My  training  is  as  an  experi-
mental physicist in the field of high energy physics, in which I received a doctorate
in 1969.

When I began at the TPO, later the S&T Directorate, there were very few people
on  staff,  perhaps  some  25.  That  number  ramped  up  quite  quickly  in  the  months
after  March  2003.  At  first,  many  of  us  shared  duties;  I  was  in  charge  of  the  Explo-
sives Countermeasures Portfolio for a few months and at the same time responsible
for  overseeing  EML,  this  latter  task  only  for  a  few  months.  In  addition,  I  worked
in  the  Radiation  and  Nuclear  Countermeasures  Portfolio  group  as  well.  My  efforts
to  understand  EML  were  aided  by  the  presence  of  two  EML  staff,  who  were  on  de-
tail to the TPO and subsequently to S&T.

By  summer  2003,  things  had  settled  down  a  bit,  and  I  had  just  a  dual  responsi-
bility:  Program  Manager  for  Radiation  and  Nuclear  Countermeasures  and  Program
Manager  for  Explosives  Countermeasures  in  the  Office  of  Research  and  Develop-
ment (ORD). In these roles, I was responsible for research programs that were car-
ried out by the Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Laboratories, and those car-
ried out by EML. Nearly all of my efforts were devoted to the large National Labora-
tories,  as  their  projects  consumed  nearly  all  the  budget  allocated  to  my  Program.
EML Programs at Transition to DHS

My responsibilities regarding EML began soon after departmental stand-up, with
administrative  and  programmatic  oversight.  During  the  time  that  I  had  this  broad
responsibility,  I  visited  the  site,  became  acquainted  with  current  projects  and  staff
and  learned  about  the  lab’s  capabilities,  which  they  were  trying  to  adapt  to  DHS
needs.

21

It  was  clear  that  there  would  be  some  mismatches  in  capabilities  relative  to  the
new  DHS  needs.  Their  previous  work  centered  around  low-level  radiation  measure-
ments. These were in support of environmental clean-up and monitoring and of glob-
al monitoring for fallout from nuclear weapons testing. However, I judged that their
abilities  in  the  area  of  radiation  detection  were  adaptable  to  DHS  requirements.
EML  staff  also  worked  on  or  led  activities  that  provided  the  environmental  moni-
toring community with manuals on procedures and protocols for environmental sam-
pling. This work could have some application for DHS, for example, in providing ad-
vice for clean-up after a dirty bomb attack.

Another  major  line  of  work  at  EML  was  the  Quality  Assurance  Program  (QAP),
which  vetted  scores  of  radiological  laboratories,  in  the  United  States  and  also  in
other  countries,  to  determine  the  quality  of  their  analytical  practices.  This  was  a
service provided by EML, earlier funded by DOE, but in which DHS had no interest
at the time (I understand that recently, S&T is setting up an Integrated Consortium
of  Laboratory  Networks,  in  which  the  QAP  might  have  been  a  useful  component).
Unfortunately,  this  service,  which  was  used  by  many  State  and  local  laboratories,
and,  to  my  knowledge,  was  widely  appreciated,  disappeared  when  DHS  decided  to
end  funding  for  it.  I  understand  that  a  commercial  laboratory  is  now  providing  a
similar service, but at significant cost.
Overall Assessment of EML at Transition

My  assessment  of  the  laboratory  and  its  potential  uses  for  DHS  were  as  follows.
First,  the  laboratory  space,  rented  from  the  General  Services  Administration,  was
in  sad  condition,  depressing,  and  barely  functional.  The  rent  paid  was  far  too  high
for the quality of the plant. About 60 staff members were on the payroll, down from
about  120,  a  decade  or  two  earlier.  DOE  had  clearly  left  this  laboratory  in  a  ne-
glected state, as a backwater, perhaps because emphasis on DOE clean-up activities
dropped in recent years. The lab was in a clear decline, but welcomed and embraced
the  chance  for  a  rebirth  as  part  of  a  mission  in  which  they  had  a  strong  and  vital
interest. The lab is located only about a mile from the World Trade Center, and staff
were strongly and viscerally affected by 9/11. They were extremely motivated to be-
come  part  of  the  global  anti-terrorism  effort,  as  well  as  to  be  in  a  position  to  take
practical steps to aid in protecting New York against future attacks.

Some  of  the  technical  staff  had  been  employed  at  tasks  that  had  not  changed
much  for  several  decades.  Many  appeared  ready  for  retirement,  and,  indeed,  in  the
following years, a large number did retire. Some retirements, however, especially in
2005  and  beyond,  were  apparently  occasioned  by  disappointment,  if  not  outrage,  at
the treatment they felt EML was receiving from DHS Headquarters.

On  the  other  hand,  a  large  fraction  of  the  technical  staff,  of  varied  ages,  im-
pressed me as highly motivated, energetic, and very capable in their areas of exper-
tise. The laboratory had transitioned their work over to projects that they felt would
be useful and welcomed by DHS.

One activity, the NY Area Science and Technology (NYAST) Working Group, held
seminars for New York Metropolitan Area first responders: police, firemen, medical
technicians,  and  civilian  staff  from  the  Office  of  Emergency  Management.  Lessons
were  given  these  non-scientists  about  understanding  radiation,  the  dirty  bomb
threat,  and  how  to  use  radiation  measuring  equipment.  In  talking  with  some  par-
ticipants on later occasions, I learned that these sessions were appreciated and con-
sidered very useful. They were quite well attended.

Another  project  of  interest  to  me  and  to  New  York  City  officials  was  the  Com-
prehensive  Radiation  Sensor  Program,  which  deployed  a  small  number  of  inexpen-
sive but effective gamma ray detectors on rooftops in Manhattan. This network was
intended  to  send  data  back  via  a  wireless  connection  to  a  command  center  at  the
lab. The project was meant to function as an early prototype for a detection architec-
ture  that  would  produce  relatively  inexpensive  monitoring  of  selected  areas  of  the
city, in the case of a radiation release. City officials at the Office of Emergency Man-
agement were enthusiastic about this program (as long as they did not have to fund
it).  This  project  was  scheduled  to  be  halted  at  the  time  I  left,  and  headquarters
funding was cut off, but it has been resurrected since, paid for only by staff salaries
and time.

A third project, extremely interesting to me, was run by an EML physicist of na-
tional stature, Paul Goldhagen. Dr. Goldhagen was measuring the spectrum of neu-
trons from cosmic rays, in order to understand better the ‘‘ship effect.’’ If we under-
stood  this  effect,  it  might  enable  us  to  reject  this  background  and  be  able  to  detect
radiological  material  in  containers  on  ships,  as  they  traveled  across  oceans  to
United  States  ports.  This  was  basic  research  with  a  clear  and  vital  connection  to
homeland  security  needs,  and  only  a  very  few  researchers  in  the  country  were  in-
volved in similar work.

Finally, there was program of global atmospheric monitoring, which had national
security implications. It was co-funded by DOE/NNSA and the USAF, and provided
useful, near-real time sets of atmospheric data.

By summer, I had transitioned to my program management role, and had no fur-
ther  oversight  over  the  lab  as  a  whole,  except  insofar  as  they  carried  out  projects
for me.
My View of the Proper Role for EML

Since, upon its creation, DHS had willingly accepted EML as part of its organiza-
tion,  it  was  clearly  incumbent  upon  DHS  management  to  establish  that  lab’s  new
mission,  of  course  with  input  from  and  in  collaboration  with  lab  management.  In-
deed,  DHS  should  have  had  an  idea  how  the  lab  would  be  useful  to  them  before
accepting it on board. I saw no evidence that serious thought was given to this. In-
deed,  after  a  year  or  two,  I  heard  grumbling  among  S&T  management  that  EML
had  no  idea  what  its  mission  should  be,  as  though  this  were  not  the  responsibility
of  S&T  itself.  Actually,  EML  had  proposed  some  ideas  for  the  proper  scope  of  their
activities,  but  none  was  accepted.  I  was  concerned  that  there  appeared  to  be  no
meaningful  dialogue  between  S&T  and  EML  to  address  the  lab’s  mission.  During
this  period,  EML  tried  to  conduct  its  own  planning,  work,  and  outreach  without
much help or, indeed, interest from S&T.

My view, then and now, is the following: DHS was fortunate in acquiring an exist-
ing  laboratory  asset  located  in  New  York  City,  a  prime  target  of  international  ter-
rorists. The lab had, on its own, developed excellent working relations with city offi-
cials  and  could  function  as  S&T’s  presence  in  the  area.  These  relationships  could
have  greatly  facilitated  communications  and  cooperation  between  federal  and  local
homeland security officials, at least in the radiological area. The opportunity to use
a ready-made asset in this way was unfortunately missed by S&T.

The  laboratory  had  both  negative  and  positive  aspects:  some  staff  were  old  and
tired,  but  others  were  extremely  energetic  and  effective.  The  physical  plant  was  in
bad shape, but could be improved or else the lab could be moved, perhaps to an ex-
isting  DHS  facility  in  the  area,  where  the  cost  of  rental  would  not  be  an  issue.  Fi-
nally, some excellent capabilities existed at the lab, which could have been expanded
upon. Some of these were:

tamination measurements;

• the atmospheric monitoring project;
• the neutron ‘‘ship effect’’ work;
• a  strong  operational  and  statistical  understanding  of  low-level  radiation  con-
• the vetting of a nationwide network of radiochemical laboratories;
• the development of an inexpensive distributed network of radiation detectors;
• and, most importantly, a cadre of willing and active scientists who were anx-
ious to help, for example, with developing, operating, and staffing a radiation
measurement test bed in New York.

This  last  item  was  fortunately  accomplished:  EML  scientists  became  an  integral
part  of  DHS’s  Countermeasures  Test  Bed,  operationally  testing  radiation  detection
equipment that was deployed at air- and seaports in the New York area.

Unfortunately, most other items were not accomplished.
Had  I  had  the  authority,  I  would  have  tried  to  have  EML  both  engage  in  the
above  work  and  also  support  the  rest  of  DHS  fully  in  other  radiological  projects  in
the New York area. I would have considered trying to provide some of the services,
such as the QAP, for the good of the community of radiochemical laboratories in the
country,  probably  in  collaboration  with  DOE.  And  I  would  have  kept  some  of  the
atmospheric  monitoring  work  that  was  useful  for  other  U.S.  Government  agencies,
even  though  it  did  not  fit  within  the  prevailing  definition  of  DHS  responsibilities.
Further,  I  would  have  authorized  the  lab  to  hire  some  young  scientists  with  re-
cent  degrees,  to  reinvigorate  what  had  been  a  leading  radiation  measurements  lab-
oratory,  some  20–30  years  earlier.  Many  such  newly-minted  Ph.D.s  would,  in  my
opinion, have been keenly interested in contributing their knowledge and talents to
defending the Nation against the terrorist threat. Briefly, I would have decided that
although the lab had some issues, it would have been worth rebuilding it into a high
profile DHS/S&T facility in New York.

Apparently, DHS management did not share my feeling.

Proposals and Rejections

During  2003,  S&T  management  wisely  decided  to  permit  ongoing  projects  to  con-
tinue.  In  2004,  management  naturally  and  correctly  wanted  to  develop  a  program
plan  for  EML  that  corresponded  more  to  DHS  needs  and  requirements.  EML  pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

23

posed  several  projects,  working  with  me  as  appropriate,  but  very  few  of  these  met
approval  from  management  above  my  level.  The  Comprehensive  Radiation  Sensor
project,  for  example,  was  disapproved,  even  though  NY  City  officials  were  very  in-
terested in it. Management decided that many projects were not within DHS’s mis-
sion,  and,  indeed,  this  might  have  been  true  in  some  cases,  although  I  disagreed
with their assessments in others. At this point, I sensed a growing difficulty in the
relations and communications between EML and S&T’s management.

By  spring  2005,  as  we  were  still  working  on  programs  and  budgets  for  FY05,
which had begun six months earlier, little remained of what EML had initiated post
9/11. Technical assistance and training for local officials was cut back by two-thirds.
Other proposals were rejected in their entirety.

In  addition,  a  bit  later,  a  new  project,  involving  EML,  was  requested  by  S&T  ’s
Portfolio  Manager  for  Radiation  and  Nuclear  Countermeasures,  Dr.  Sonya  Bowyer.
This  effort  was  called  ‘‘reachback.’’  It  proposed  using  EML  scientists  (together  with
scientists  from  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  in  Long  Island)  to  provide  assist-
ance  to  local  officials  and  responders,  when  their  radiation  monitoring  equipment
produced  alarms.  The  general  idea,  which  had  been  conceived  much  earlier,  was  to
have  a  process  in  place  to  deal  quickly  with  inevitable  false  alarms.  Experts  from
the labs would provide advice to the responder in real time in analyzing the alarm.
On  those  few  occasions  where  they  could  not  resolve  the  alarm,  another  level  of
reachback  would  be  provided  by  the  national  weapons  laboratories.  This  program
was to serve the New York region. There were efforts to make similar arrangements
with other laboratories for other regions of the country.

Fortunately, reachback has now been resurrected by the Domestic Nuclear Detec-
tion Office (DNDO), located within DHS, but independent of S&T. I understand that
this work is about to be realized, both regionally and nationally. However, I am told
that  there  are  still  problems  in  that  EML  was  experiencing  difficulties  in  getting
approval  to  purchase  a  few  hundred  dollars  of  equipment  to  enable  their  participa-
tion. I hope this has been resolved.
My Resignation from S&T

Committee  staff  have  requested  that  I  recount  the  story  of  my  resignation  from
S&T.  In  most  respects,  this  is  not  an  important  matter.  However,  the  reasons  that
led me to resign may be of interest. With your forbearance and for the record, here
is the long story.

In  March  and  early  April  of  2005,  I  had  to  spend  much  time  explaining  the  de-
tailed  costs  of  several  EML  projects.  I  was  asked  to  justify  detailed  expenditures,
at  a  minute  level,  for  several  proposed  ideas.  This  was  demanded  by  an  ORD  col-
league, Dr. John Clarke, who was supposedly in charge of EML as a facility. It was
disturbing  to  me  that  the  facility  manager  was  deciding  at  such  a  nickel  and  dime
level  how  much  each  R&D  project  should  cost  and  whether  it  should  proceed,  since
this  should  reasonably  have  been  the  purview  of  the  program  manager.  However,
to  maintain  comity,  I  took  time  away  from  far  more  complex  and  larger  projects  at
other  laboratories,  for  which  I  was  also  responsible,  to  try  to  accommodate  his  re-
quests.  In  the  end,  since  I  had  those  other  demanding  tasks  to  take  care  of,  and
since  this  exercise  was  draining  my  time  over  relatively  small  matters,  I  suggested
that  Dr.  Clarke  take  over  the  whole  set  of  EML  projects,  with  the  exception  of  a
few  that  I  had  been  told  (by  Robert  Hooks,  Deputy  Director  of  ORD)  had  already
been approved at the Office Director level.

One of the exceptions was the ‘‘ship effect’’ project, being handled by the excellent
physicist  I  mentioned  above.  I  had  approved  the  project,  but  Dr.  Clarke  somehow
was  able  to  place  a  hold  on  the  money,  because  he  objected  to  the  purchase  of  a
neutron detector that was included as part of the work. Dr. Clarke insisted that he
had this right. He further stated that he could not approve such an expense unless
we  could  show  that  the  detector  could  be  used  after  the  project’s  end.  This  dem-
onstrated  that  Dr.  Clarke  had  no  idea  of  how  research  and  development  is  carried
out: if a project is approved, you buy the necessary equipment to carry it out, wheth-
er  or  not  you  can  find  another  use  for  it  later.  The  cost  and  need  of  equipment  are
factored  into  the  approval  process.  Indeed,  one  usually  can  find  another  use  for
equipment  and  this  case  was  not  an  exception:  we  could  have.  The  impression  was
clearly  that  Dr.  Clarke  was  trying  even  to  derail  a  project  already  approved  at  the
highest appropriate level.

Having vociferously defended this project earlier, and since I had been previously
assured  by  Mr.  Hooks  that  this  project  had  indeed  been  approved  at  the  Office  Di-
rector’s  level,  I  was  quite  properly  outraged.  I  sent  e-mails  that  included  my  direct
supervisor,  Dr.  Gerald  Parker,  and  his  supervisor,  who  was  Mr.  Hooks,  but  they
brought  no  response.  Finally,  I  received  a  response  from  Mr.  Hooks  on  March  28,
2005,  to  the  effect  that  Dr.  Clarke  and  I  had  to  work  this  out.  This  contradicted

24

what  Mr.  Hooks  had  told  me  about  the  project’s  approval  a  week  or  two  earlier.  A
further request to Dr. Parker for clarification elicited no response whatsoever.

At  this  point,  I  decided  that  S&T/ORD  management  was  broken  to  the  degree
that  I  could  no  longer  perform  my  job,  and  I  had  to  leave  my  position.  On  April
4,  I  sent  an  e-mail  with  my  resignation  to  my  chain  of  command,  including  Dr.
Parker, Mr. Hooks, and the Office Director, Dr. Maureen McCarthy.

It  turned  out  that  I  was  correct  in  determining  that  management  was  broken:
within  three  days,  Dr.  Parker  summoned  me  to  his  office  and  handed  me  a  ‘‘Letter
of  Counseling’’—essentially  a  reprimand—for  daring  to  resign,  and  threatening  me
with  reprisals  if  I  continued  such  unreasonable  behavior.  I  was  also  chastised  for
objecting  to  Dr.  Clarke’s  overstepping  his  authority.  This  divorcement  from  reality
was noteworthy.

Incidentally, in nearly 20 years of government service, I had never before received
a  reprimand  of  any  sort.  I  have,  however,  received  a  number  of  commendations  for
my work, both verbal and written.

Naturally,  I  left  S&T  as  soon  as  I  could,  within  two  working  days,  and  accepted
a position with the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, remaining there for the rest
of my federal service, and retiring on September 30, 2005. Indeed, most radiological
work was already being transitioned from S&T to this new office. The working envi-
ronment there was quite satisfactory.

Afterwards,  I  was  happy  to  discover,  the  ‘‘ship  effect’’  project  had  been  approved
in  its  entirety,  probably  as  a  result  of  the  furor.  But,  to  keep  the  project  going  as
it  should  have,  I  had  been  forced  to  resign  in  order  to  draw  sufficient  attention  to
the matter.
Conclusions

It  appeared  to  me  that  in  2005,  S&T  management  was  trying  to  squeeze  EML
out  of  existence  by  turning  off  projects  one  by  one,  so  that  it  could  finally  be  as-
serted  that  the  lab  had  no  function.  It  became  increasingly  difficult  to  obtain  ap-
proval for any expenditures beyond the basic minima of salaries and benefits, heat,
light,  and  rent.  Further,  EML  was  not  permitted  to  replace  staff  departures,  and
the  number  of  personnel  has  shrunk  from  60  in  2003  to  34  today.  I  cannot  prove
there was an overt intent to close the lab; indeed, Mr. Hooks assured me at the time
I  left  that  this  was  not  the  case,  but  Occam’s  Razor  (adopt  the  simplest  hypothesis
that  satisfies  all  the  known  data)  indicated  to  me  strongly  that  this  was,  in  fact,
what was happening.

EML  still  exists,  to  my  knowledge,  in  great  part  because  DNDO  is  using  some
of  their  personnel  for  projects  in  the  New  York  area.  Perhaps,  since  responsibility
for  radiological  and  nuclear  issues  has  transitioned  to  DNDO,  it  might  be  appro-
priate for EML to come entirely under its aegis.

If  EML  were  to  remain  in  existence,  my  remarks  above  contain  some  ideas  on
what  I  feel  it  might  do,  and  how  it  might  make  a  significant  contribution  to  home-
land  security.  Even  at  its  current,  depressed,  levels,  it  can  be  successfully  resur-
rected,  if  a  clear  mission  is  articulated  and  appropriate  management  is  applied.  I
do  think  this  is  possible.  Some  changes  will  be  needed,  of  course:  for  one  thing,  it
should  probably  move  to  a  new  venue  in  the  New  York  area,  perhaps,  as  I  noted
above, within a DHS-owned facility.

If  its  mission  would  include  functioning  as  the  focus  of  DHS’s  technical  capabili-
ties  in  the  New  York  area,  beyond  radiological  and  nuclear  issues,  it  would  be  nec-
essary to hire some new scientists and engineers with expertise in chemical and bio-
logical countermeasures. This would transform EML into a broader and more capa-
ble  organization.  One  could  also  imagine  adding  collaborative  efforts  with  another
S&T laboratory, the Transportation Security Laboratory in Atlantic City, about 100
miles to the south. TSL specializes in explosives detection, and joint work in testing
this  sort  of  equipment  in  New  York  City  would  probably  be  a  useful  synergy.  If
EML were to be broadened in this way, one could argue that it should remain with-
in  S&T,  which,  having  recently  been  reorganized,  might  be  more  receptive  to  such
a concept than it was in the past.
An Additional Observation

There may be a broader issue here.
In  2003,  two  laboratories,  EML  and  the  Plum  Island  Animal  Disease  Center
(PIADC),  were  relocated  from  other  agencies  to  S&T,  a  new  organization  within  a
new  organization.  I  understand  from  the  press  that  there  are  now  plans  to  close
Plum Island and relocate its activities elsewhere, probably with a largely new staff.
It is not surprising that, amidst all the difficulties of establishing new, nested struc-
tures,  and  under  the  watchful  eye  of  a  fearful  public  following  9/11,  these  two  lab-

oratories have experienced serious difficulties while trying to fit into a new Depart-
ment and to develop missions rather different from their previous ones.

However,  I  am  also  concerned  about  a  third  laboratory,  the  above-mentioned
Transportation  Security  Laboratory  (TSL),  also  involved  in  post-9/11  turmoil.  TSL
has  just  (2006)  transitioned  to  S&T  from  the  Transportation  Security  Administra-
tion (TSA), which is, of course, also within DHS.

TSL is not a minor player: it is the world’s gold standard for developing and certi-
fying  explosives  detection  equipment,  especially  as  applied  to  transportation  secu-
rity.  Virtually  all  security  technology  in  U.S.  (and  in  many  foreign)  airports  today
have  been  developed  there.  Vitally  needed  improvements  are  being  developed  there
right  now.  The  lab  and  its  staff  are  impressive:  I  urge  the  Committee  Members  to
visit it.

Unfortunately, in the bureaucratic turbulence following 9/11, TSL has been moved
between  agencies  twice.  Its  budget  has  undergone  wild  fluctuations,  both  up  and
down.  This  year,  I  am  told,  their  budget  has  dropped  by  a  factor  of  two  from  last
year.  This  unstable  situation,  both  institutional  and  fiscal,  is  destroying  morale
there; some scientists have left, others may well leave soon. Staff have been reduced
from  about  80,  a  few  years  ago,  to  54  now.  Like  EML,  they  have  not  recently  been
able to hire new scientists or engineers. There are rumors that its equipment certifi-
cation  unit,  which  has  been  looked  upon  to  provide  aviation  security  equipment
standards around the world, may be asked to raise money from vendors to continue
its  effective  existence,  beyond  the  fees  currently  levied  on  those  asking  for  certifi-
cation.  There  are  other  rumors  that  this  federal  laboratory,  staffed  by  federal  em-
ployees, may be required to compete for its existence with national laboratories (that
have  relatively  immense  levels  of  staffing,  much  other  funding  and  other  missions)
and with the private sector.

I  hope  these  tales  aren’t  true.  The  Federal  Government’s  ability  to  issue  stand-
ards for explosives detectors should not depend on a revenue stream. Moreover, TSL
and other federal laboratories are part of the federal infrastructure: they are federal
assets,  run  by  federal  employees,  who  have  loyalty  to  the  mission,  and  who  do  not
have to keep an eye out for profits or for obtaining the next contract. This laboratory
is  especially  needed  to  provide  for  the  Nation’s  security,  particularly  regarding  air
travel, where we all know there is a serious, ongoing terrorist threat.

I trust and hope that DHS will now be able to provide TSL with steady and pre-
dictable funding and a consistent vision, so that it may continue its excellent work.
I  fervently  hope  that  TSL  will  not  be  subject  to  the  same  perturbations  that  the
other  two  laboratories  within  DHS  have  endured  during  this  difficult  period  of  ad-
justment.

BIOGRAPHY FOR M. ANTHONY FAINBERG

Upon  retiring  from  federal  service  after  twenty  years,  Dr.  Fainberg  recently  be-
came  a  Staff  Member  at  the  Institute  for  Defense  Analyses.  At  retirement,  Dr.
Fainberg was Director of the Office of Transformational Research and Development
of  the  Domestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security.
At the Department of Homeland Security, he had previously been Program Manager
for  Radiological/Nuclear  Countermeasures  and  for  Explosives  Countermeasures  in
the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department. Earlier, he served as Di-
rector  for  Federal  Laboratories  in  that  Directorate.  Previously,  he  was  Division
Chief  at  the  Advanced  Systems  and  Concepts  Office,  Defense  Threat  Reduction
Agency, Department of Defense, and before that, he held the title of Director of the
Office of Policy and Planning for Aviation Security in the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration.

After  receiving  his  training  and  degrees  in  experimental  particle  physics,  Dr.
Fainberg worked as a researcher and university lecturer for eleven years, producing
some 40 technical publications. His experience includes work at U.S. National Lab-
oratories;  at  CERN,  the  international  nuclear  laboratory  in  Geneva;  and  at  univer-
sities in the U.S. and Italy. He turned to applied physics in 1977, entering the field
of  nuclear  safeguards  and  nonproliferation  at  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory,
where he was responsible for projects involving technical, systems, and policy issues.
In  the  course  of  his  duties  at  Brookhaven,  he  worked  with  officials  at  the  U.S.  De-
partment  of  Energy,  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission,  and  the  Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.

In  1983,  Dr.  Fainberg  became  a  Congressional  Science  Fellow  of  the  American
Physical  Society  and  spent  a  year  as  a  legislative  aide  in  the  office  of  a  U.S.  Sen-
ator.  Following  the  fellowship,  he  joined  the  staff  of  the  Congressional  Office  of
Technology Assessment, where he specialized in national security issues. He worked
for  several  years  in  analyses  of  missile  defense  technologies.  Later,  he  worked  on

projects  dealing  with  the  Department  of  Energy  nuclear  weapon  complex,  the  pro-
liferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  and  has  originated  and  directed  projects
on terrorism and on technologies of use in military operations other than war.

Dr.  Fainberg  has  frequently  testified  before  Congress  and  has  briefed  both  con-
gressional  staff  and  the  media  in  his  areas  of  expertise;  he  has  appeared  on  Na-
tional  Public  Radio,  CNN,  BBC,  CNBC,  and  other  outlets.  He  has  also  briefed  Na-
tional Academy of Sciences panels on aviation security matters. Dr. Fainberg is also
active  in  the  American  Physical  Society  and  the  American  Association  for  the  Ad-
vancement of Science, and has co-edited a book on energy supply and demand.

STATEMENT  OF  MS.  LYNN  ALBIN,  RADIATION  HEALTH  PHYSI-
CIST,  OFFICE  OF  RADIATION  PROTECTION,  WASHINGTON
STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
Ms.  ALBIN.  Chairman  Miller,  Congressman  McCaul  and  Com-
mittee  Members,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  testi-
mony  on  the  experience  of  Washington  State  in  our  environmental
radiation  monitoring  efforts  following  the  termination  of  EML’s
Quality  Assurance  Program.  I  have  worked  for  the  Washington
State Department of Health for 21 years. I began as a radiochemist
with  the  responsibility  to  provide  accurate  analysis  of  radioactive
contaminants  in  environmental  samples.  Presently,  I  am  a  health
physicist  with  the  Department  of  Health,  where  I  use  the  data  to
assess  public  and  environmental  health  risks  and  to  provide  over-
sight  of  federal  and  State  licensed  facilities  that  could  potentially
release  radioactive  contaminants  into  the  environment.  I  am  also
responsible for analyzing radiochemical data to determine its qual-
ity and its validity.

The Washington State Department of Health has operated in en-
vironmental  radiation  monitoring  programs  since  1961.  All  of  the
samples collected by the Department of Health are analyzed by the
Public  Health  Laboratory.  This  laboratory  has  the  capability  to
analyze  for  very  low  levels  of  naturally  occurring  radionuclides,
mixed  fission  products  and  source  materials  in  any  environmental
media.

Of  particular  interest  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security,
the  Public  Health  Lab  analyzes  the  air  we  breathe,  the  water  we
drink, the soil in which we grow our food, the food we eat and the
external  radiation  levels  that  surround  us.  The  laboratory  uses
rapid methods to screen deposition samples to quickly identify con-
taminants.  The  data  provides  the  basis  of  environmental  assess-
ments  and  decisions  that  are  made  during  radiological  emer-
gencies.  I  can’t  emphasize  enough  how  important  it  is  that  we  are
confident that the data is both accurate and precise when we make
public health decisions.

When  it  was  part  of  the  Department  of  Energy,  EML  provided
performance testing samples for exactly the type of work the Public
Laboratory  performs.  This  program  was  available  at  no  charge  to
the  Public  Health  Laboratory  and  was  an  important  component  of
quality assurance.

QAP  provided  a  link  to  the  scientists  within  the  Environmental
Monitoring  Laboratory.  Radiochemists  who  develop  many  of  the
classical  methods  of  analyzing  radionuclides  in  the  environment
worked for EML. These methods were complied into a manual that
is widely regarded as the standard of radiation measurement tech-
niques. As a new radiochemist, I was handed the manual as a basis
of understanding radiochemistry. This practice continues today.

It  wasn’t  only  the  EML  performance  testing  samples  and  the
radiochemistry manual that benefited the quality of measurements.
It  was  also  that  the  scientists  themselves  were  easily  approached
to assist Public Health Laboratory chemists in solving questions re-
garding  radiochemistry.  Radiochemistry  is  part  science  and  part
art.  The  science  behind  the  chemistry  allows  separation  and  con-
centration of specific radionuclides, but there is also an art that re-
quires  experience  to  correctly  interpret  resulting  data.  It  takes
years of experience to be proficient in radiochemistry. The EML as-
sisted the Public Health Laboratory whenever called upon.

Performance testing is important for assessment of laboratory ca-
pabilities,  as  well  as  important  to  the  Department  of  Health’s
credibility when we use lab data to support decisions. The value of
the performance testing comes into play when data or decisions are
questioned.  From  Washington  State’s  point  of  view,  the  more  per-
formance tests we have to support our data the better.

Two  examples  of  how  QAP  helped  prepare  Washington  State  to
respond to an actual emergency are the state’s response to fires on
the Hanford nuclear site in 2000 and the Department of Homeland
Security’s TOPOFF2 exercise in 2003. During the Hanford fire, the
state  mobilized  field  teams  to  collect  samples.  As  the  fire  burned,
wind  created  the  concern  that  soil  surface  contamination  would  be
blown  offsite.  The  Department  of  Health  analyzed  soil,  airborne
particulates  and  charred  vegetation  samples.  Sampling  results
showed  that  first  responders  were  not  working  in  a  radiologically
hazardous  environment  and  no  offsite  public  or  environmental
health impact existed.

It  is  just  as  critical  that  decision-makers  are  confident  that  the
laboratory  has  reached  appropriate  detection  limits,  even  in  cases
where  the  data  reveal  no  impact.  QAP  provided  an  independent
evaluation of lab performance that specifically supported the credi-
bility  of  Washington  State  protective  actions.  Performance  testing
is essential in assuring that if results are questioned, there is a re-
liable  method  to  verify  data.  Washington  State,  since  losing  the
program,  participates  less  often  in  performance  testing  programs
because of budget considerations.

During  TOPOFF2,  Washington  State  had  to  make  quick  assess-
ments  of  radiological  conditions  following  a  simulated  terrorist  at-
tack.  Although  unplanned,  samples  collected  by  other  agencies,  in-
cluding  the  EPA  and  the  Federal  Radiological  Monitoring  Assess-
ment Center, were also brought to the Public Health Laboratory for
analysis.  The  lab’s  strong  quality  assurance  program  gave  con-
fidence that the initial assessments were correct, even though sam-
ples were not commonly analyzed at the laboratory. It further pro-
vided  evidence  to  other  agencies  that  lab  services  had  documented
verification  and  it  was  capable  of  accurately  and  precisely  meas-
uring  radioactive  contamination  in  environmental  samples.  Once

again, the data reported by the Public Health Lab was used to sup-
port protective action decisions. Confidence in that data was essen-
tial.

In 2003, the department participated in a performance test spon-
sored  by  NIST,  designed  to  test  the  capability  and  capacity  of  lab-
oratories  to  quickly  measure  radioactive  contaminants  in  environ-
mental media as well as synthetic urine and feces. One of the find-
ings of the study was an appreciation for the analytical uncertainty
in the reported result, which was much higher than for traditional
performance  tests.  This  gave  rise  to  questions  of  how  good  is  good
enough for emergency samples, how do we communicate analytical
uncertainty  to  decision-makers,  and  how,  in  turn,  will  that  uncer-
tainty  be  factored  into  protective  action?  These  are  all  questions
that  remain  unanswered  and  could  be  a  starting  point  for  future
EML  support  to  states  for  homeland  security-related  emergencies.
As  a  person  who  reviews  data  validity,  I  must  be  confident  that
I am handing the best information to the decision-makers. The wel-
fare of the public, emergency workers and the environment rely on
the  quality  of  laboratory  data.  These  results  for  the  basis  for  deci-
sions concerning health risk, food embargoes and population reloca-
tion. Performance testing supports data quality assessment by pro-
viding  an  independent  evaluation  of  lab  capability.  This  inde-
pendent  review  helps  defend  data,  whether  they  support  rec-
ommended  protective  actions  that  may  impact  someone’s  life,  or
whether they lend confidence to a recommendation of no action.

In  conclusion,  accurate,  defensible  data  improves  environmental
assessments  and  enables  managers  to  make  better  and  more  cost-
efficient  decisions.  The  termination  of  the  QAP  affects  Washington
State  because  we  can’t  guarantee  the  level  of  participation  in  the
private laboratory replacement programs due to costs. Cutting per-
formance  programs  weakens  the  defensibility  of  the  data.  We  are
also  missing  the  solid  technical  support  to  the  Public  Health  Lab-
oratory  provided  by  the  Quality  Assurance  Program  and  the  sci-
entists at Environmental Measurements Laboratory.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LYNN ALBIN

Dear Chairman Miller and Ranking Member James Sensenbrenner,

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  provide  testimony  on  the  experience  of  Wash-
ington  State  in  our  environmental  radiation  monitoring  efforts  following  the  termi-
nation  of  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  (EML)  Quality  Assurance
Program  (QAP).  My  name  is  Lynn  Albin  and  I  have  worked  for  the  Washington
State Department of Health for 21 years. I began as a radiochemist with the respon-
sibility  to  provide  accurate  analyses  of  radioactive  contaminants  in  environmental
samples.  Presently,  I  am  a  radiation  health  physicist  with  the  Department  of
Health’s  Office  of  Radiation  Protection.  My  responsibilities 
include  using
radiochemical  analyses  to  assess  public  and  environmental  health  risks  and  to  pro-
vide  oversight  of  federal  and  State-licensed  facilities  that  could  potentially  release
radioactive contaminants in the environment. Additionally, I am the liaison between
Office  of  Radiation  Protection  and  the  Department’s  Public  Health  Laboratory
(PHL). In this capacity, I am responsible for analyzing radiochemical data to deter-
mine its quality and validity.

The Washington State Department of Health has operated an environmental radi-
ation monitoring program since 1961. The early program looked primarily at atmos-
pheric  fallout  from  nuclear  weapons  tests.  The  program  expanded  to  evaluate  off-
site environmental impacts related to operations of nuclear facilities and to provide
readiness  for  assessment  in  case  of  a  radiological  emergency.  An  essential  part  of
the assessments is the independent analysis of environmental samples.

All of the samples collected by the Department of Health are analyzed at the Pub-
lic Health Laboratory. The Laboratory has the capability to analyze for very low lev-
els of naturally occurring radionuclides, mixed fission products and source materials
in any environmental media.

Of particular interest to the Department of Homeland Security, the Public Health
Laboratory  analyzes  the  air  we  breathe,  the  water  we  drink,  the  soil  in  which  we
grow  our  food,  the  food  we  eat  and  the  external  radiation  levels  that  surround  us.
The  Laboratory  also  uses  rapid  methods  to  screen  deposition  samples  to  quickly
identify  radioactive  contaminants.  The  data  provided  is  the  basis  of  environmental
assessments  and  decisions  made  during  radiological  emergencies.  I  cannot  empha-
size enough how important it is that we are confident that the data is both accurate
and precise when we make public health decisions.

When it was part of the Department of Energy, the Environmental Measurements
Laboratory,  provided  performance  testing  samples  for  exactly  the  type  of  work  the
Public Health Laboratory performs. This program was available at no charge to the
Public Health Laboratory and was an important component of laboratory quality as-
surance. Through this program, the Public Health Laboratory was supplied with en-
vironmental  samples  that  contained  well-quantified  amounts  of  radionuclides.  The
Laboratory analyzed the samples and reported the results back to EML. EML would
then  evaluate  the  data  and  document  the  accuracy  of  the  submitted  result  against
the known value and against the mean value submitted by all participating labora-
tories.

As far as I know, all radiochemistry laboratories supporting environmental moni-
toring  in  the  Northwest  participated  in  the  Quality  Assessment  Program.  Because
the  QAP  results  for  all  laboratories  were  included  in  the  summary  reports,  I  was
able  to  use  these  reports  when  reviewing  performance  of  other  Northwest  environ-
mental radiochemistry labs.

Additionally the QAP provided a link to the scientists within Environmental Mon-
itoring  Laboratory.  Radiochemists  who  developed  many  of  the  classical  methods  for
analyzing  radionuclides  in  environmental  samples  worked  for  EML.  These  methods
were  compiled  into  a  manual  that  is  widely  regarded  as  the  standard  of  radiation
measurement techniques. As a new radiochemist, I was handed that manual as the
basis of understanding radiochemistry. This practice continues today.

It wasn’t only the EML performance testing samples and the radiochemistry man-
ual that benefited the quality of measurements; it was also that the chemists them-
selves were easily approached to assist Public Health Laboratory chemists in solving
questions  regarding  radiochemistry.  Radiochemistry  is  part  science  and  part  art.
The  science  behind  chemistry  allows  the  separation  and  concentration  of  specific
radionuclides but there is also an art requiring experience to correctly interpret the
resulting  data.  It  takes  years  of  experience  to  be  proficient  in  radiochemistry.  The
Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  assisted  the  Public  Health  Laboratory  in
evaluating  the  ability  to  correctly  interpret  spectral  data  through  consultation  and
through  their  Gamma  Spectrometry  Data  Evaluation  Program.  This  program  pro-
vided simulated spectral data to the Laboratory to test the accuracy of the gamma-
ray  spectrometry  software  and  the  ability  of  the  chemists  to  correctly  interpret  the
results of their own software. There is no replacement for this program.

The Quality Assurance Program was one of several performance testing programs
in  which  the  Public  Health  Laboratory  participated.  Table  1  attached  to  this  testi-
mony  summarizes  the  history  of  those  programs.  When  the  QAP  program  termi-
nated, the Department of Health lost a cost-effective resource for evaluating labora-
tory  performance  as  well  as  the  resource  provided  by  EML  scientists  themselves.
The  Public  Health  Laboratory  replaced  the  QAP  with  a  performance  testing  pro-
gram  provided  by  a  private  laboratory  and  augmented  tests  from  an  existing  pro-
gram.  This  private  laboratory  provides  the  same  environmental  media  and  tests
that were previously provided by QAP. The disadvantage of the new program is that
it  is  expensive.  In  fact,  this  year  the  Public  Health  Laboratory  could  not  afford  to
fully participate in this performance testing program.

While there is no legal requirement to participate in all performance tests, labora-
tories cannot be certified by EPA to analyze drinking water samples or be qualified
to  perform  environmental  measurements  in  support  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s
Environmental  Management’s  activities  without  successfully  passing  a  minimum
number of tests. Performance testing is important for assessment of laboratory capa-
bilities  as  well  as  important  to  the  Department  of  Health’s  credibility  when  we  use
laboratory  data  to  support  decisions.  The  value  of  the  performance  testing  program
comes  into  play  when  data  or  decisions  are  questioned.  From  Washington  State’s
point of view, the more performance tests we have to support our laboratory results,
the better.

Two examples of how the Quality Assurance Program helped prepare Washington
State to respond to actual emergency situations are the State’s response to the fires
on  the  Hanford  Nuclear  Site  in  2000  and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s
TOPOFF2 exercise in 2003.

During  the  Hanford  fire,  the  State  mobilized  field  teams  to  collect  samples.  The
Laboratory  provided  quick-turnaround  results  and  health  physicists  interpreted  re-
sults  and  guided  decision-makers  regarding  protective  actions.  As  the  fire  burned,
wind  created  concern  that  soil  surface  contamination  would  be  blown  offsite.  The
Department  of  Health  analyzed  soil,  airborne  particulates  and  charred  vegetation
samples.  Sampling  results  showed  that  the  first  responders  were  not  working  in  a
radiological  hazardous  environment  and  no  offsite  public  or  environmental  health
impact existed.

It  is  just  as  critical  that  decision-makers  are  confident  that  the  laboratory  has
reached  appropriate  detection  limits  even  in  cases  where  data  reveal  no  impact.
QAP provided an independent evaluation of laboratory performance that specifically
supported credibility of Washington State protective actions. Performance testing is
essential  in  assuring  that  if  results  are  questioned,  there  is  a  reliable  method  to
verify  data.  Washington  State,  since  losing  the  program,  participates  less  often  in
performance testing programs because of budget considerations.

During  TOPOFF2,  Washington  State  had  to  make  quick  assessments  of  radio-
logical conditions following a simulated terrorist attack. The first samples analyzed
by  the  Public  Health  Laboratory  were  non-standard  media:  deposition  collected  on
tape and soiled bandages from a victim of the initial simulated blast. These samples
provided the hazard description and were followed by the customary environmental
samples such as air particulates and soil. Although unplanned, samples collected by
other  agencies  including  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  and  the  Federal  Ra-
diological Monitoring and Assessment Center were also brought to the Public Health
Laboratory  for  analysis.  The  laboratory’s  strong  quality  assurance  program  gave
confidence  that  the  initial  assessments  were  correct  even  though  the  samples  were
not  commonly  analyzed  at  the  laboratory.  It  further  provided  evidence  to  other
agencies  using  the  State’s  laboratory  services  that  the  laboratory  had  documented
verification  that  it  was  capable  of  accurately  and  precisely  measuring  radioactive
contamination in environmental samples. Once again the data reported by the Pub-
lic Health Laboratory was used to support protective action decisions. Confidence in
that data was essential.

In  2003  the  Department  of  Health  participated  in  a  performance  test  sponsored
by  the  National  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  designed  to  test  the  capability
and capacity of the laboratories to quickly measure radioactive contaminants in en-
vironmental  media  as  well  as  in  synthetic  urine  and  feces.  This  was  the  first  such
performance test and Washington State was one of two states that participated. The
samples  were  a  challenge  to  complete  within  the  designated  time  and  required  ad-
justments in measurement protocol. One of the findings of the study was an appre-
ciation for the analytical uncertainty in the reported result which was much higher
than  for  traditional  performance  tests.  This  gave  rise  to  questions  of  how  good  is
good enough for emergency samples, how do we communicate analytical uncertainty
to  decision-makers  and  how,  in  turn,  will  that  uncertainty  be  factored  into  protec-
tive actions? These are all questions that remain unanswered and could be a start-
ing  point  for  future  EML  support  to  states  for  homeland  security-related  emer-
gencies.

As the person who reviews the data validity, I must feel confident that I am hand-
ing  the  best  information  to  the  decision-makers.  The  welfare  of  the  public,  emer-
gency  workers,  and  the  environment  rely  on  the  quality  of  the  laboratory  data.
These  results  form  the  basis  for  decisions  concerning  health  risk,  food  embargoes,
and population relocation. Performance testing supports data quality assessment by
providing  an  independent  evaluation  of  laboratory  capability.  This  independent  re-
view  helps  defend  data,  whether  they  support  recommended  protective  actions  that
may  impact  someone’s  life  or  whether  they  lend  confidence  to  a  recommendation  of
no action.

In conclusion, accurate, defensible data improves environmental assessments and
enables managers to make better and more cost-effective decisions. The termination
of the QAP affects Washington State because we cannot guarantee the level of par-
ticipation  in  the  private  laboratory  replacement  program  due  to  costs.  Cutting  per-
formance  programs  weakens  the  defensibility  of  the  data.  We  also  are  missing  the
solid technical support to the Public Health Laboratory provided by the Quality As-
surance  Program  and  the  scientists  at  the  Environmental  Measurements  Labora-
tory.

BIOGRAPHY FOR LYNN ALBIN

Lynn  Albin  is  a  Radiation  Health  Physicist  with  the  Washington  State  Depart-
ment  of  Health.  She  has  21  years  experience  in  the  environmental  radiation  field
assessing  public  and  environmental  health.  She  began  her  career  analyzing  pluto-
nium  in  coral  soils  from  the  United  States  nuclear  testing  ground  in  the  Marshall
Islands.  As  part  of  her  graduate  studies  in  Radiation  Ecology  at  the  University  of
Washington,  Ms.  Albin  studied  the  removal  rates  of  radioactive  contaminants  from
the Marshall Island Atoll ecosystem.

Ms. Albin was influential in initiating environmental monitoring at the University
of  Washington  to  assess  radioactive  fallout  following  the  1986  fire  and  explosion  of
the  Chernobyl  Nuclear  Power  Plant  in  the  Ukraine.  The  Washington  State  Depart-
ment of Social and Health Services (later the Department of Health) also responded
to the accident. In addition to monitoring fallout in air, rainwater and ambient radi-
ation  levels,  the  Department  monitored  for  contamination  in  milk,  food  and  other
environmental media. In June of 1986, Ms. Albin joined the chemists at the State’s
Public  Health  Laboratory  to  assist  with  their  response  to  the  Chernobyl  accident.
In  1988,  Ms.  Albin  transferred  within  the  Department  of  Health  to  the  Office  of
Radiation Protection. As a senior Radiation Health Physicist, her duties include en-
vironmental oversight of radiological monitoring programs within Washington State
including  the  US  Department  of  Energy’s  Hanford  Site  and  the  Energy  Northwest
nuclear  power  plant.  She  provides  technical  support  in  radiological  site  assessment
and radiological risk evaluation and leads quality assurance activities within the Of-
fice of Radiation Protection.

Ms. Albin is the laboratory liaison between the Office of Radiation Protection and
the  Department  of  Health’s  Public  Health  Laboratory.  She  is  responsible  for  ana-
lyzing  radiochemical  data  to  determine  validity,  quality  and  scientific  significance
related to public health and the environment.

Ms.  Albin  is  member  of  the  Department  of  Health’s  Emergency  Response  Team.
In this capacity she uses her expertise to provide support at the project level to en-
sure  sampling  design  and  analysis  criteria  are  appropriate  and  technically  defen-
sible. She has participated in numerous emergency response drills and exercises in-
cluding  TOPOFF2  and  has  also  responded  to  actual  emergencies  such  as  the  fire
on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hanford site in 2002.

Ms. Albin is a member of the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors’

G–2 Committee on Ionizing Measurements.

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Ms.  Albin.  Assistant  Commis-

sioner Duecker.
STATEMENT OF MR. JONATHAN A. DUECKER, ASSISTANT COM-
MISSIONER,  NEW  YORK  CITY  POLICE  DEPARTMENT,
COUNTERTERRORISM BUREAU
Mr.  DUECKER.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Miller  and  Members  of
the Committee. My name is Jonathan Duecker. I am the Assistant
Commissioner  of  Counterterrorism  for  the  New  York  City  Police
Department  and  previously,  I  was  the  Director  of  the  Office  of
Homeland  Security  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania.  I  am
pleased  to  be  here  today  and  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
speak  to  you  about  something  that  is  of  vital  importance  to  both
the city and State of New York as well as the United States.

When Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly took office in Jan-
uary 2002, the pyre in the grounds of the World Trade Center was
still  burning.  He  made  his  personal  mission  to  ensure  that  New
York City would never fall victim to such an event again. Commis-
sioner  Kelly’s  leadership  and  vision  was  the  nascence  of  the
NYPD’s Counterterrorism Bureau. The mission, to make New York
City  inhospitable  to  terrorists,  to  their  sympathizers,  their  sup-
porters and their facilitators.

Fortunately,  New  York  City  and  the  NYPD  has  thwarted  more
than  one  plot  against  New  York  since  September  11,  2001.  One
widely supported success was the investigation, the arrests and the

convictions  of  terrorists  planning  to  blow  up  the  Herald  Square
subway  station  two  weeks  before  the  Republican  National  Nomi-
nating  Convention.  In  addition,  the  NYPD’s  robust  deterrence  and
counter-surveillance  program  has  proved  its  success,  confirmed  by
Khaled Sheik Mohammed himself, who cited NYPD deployments as
the  sole  reason  that  an  Ohio  truck  driver,  Iyman  Farris,  presently
serving  a  prison  sentence  for  his  role  in  the  plot  to  demolish  the
Brooklyn Bridge, decided that he would, in fact, not carry out that
plot.

In  New  York  City,  we  are  combating  terrorism  aggressively.  We
acknowledge  and  welcome  the  synergy  that  comes  with  joining
State,  regional  and  federal  partners,  all  of  whom  bring  resources
and expertise to the fight. Over the past few years, our relationship
with the Department of Homeland Security has matured. I can say
that,  despite  differences  that  have  cropped  up  from  time  to  time,
the  level  of  cooperation  we  presently  enjoy  has  never  been  better.
It  is  in  the  spirit  of  cooperation  and  collaboration  that  I  ask  you
today  to  ensure  that  the  critical  federal  resources  are  neither
squandered  nor  withdrawn  from  New  York  City.  I  am  talking
about the yeoman’s work taking place at the Environmental Meas-
urements Laboratory located in Manhattan.

The  EML  has  distinguished  roots  dating  back  to  the  Manhattan
Project. It enjoys a renowned reputation as a subject matter expert
in  all  things  nuclear  and  radiological,  from  detection  to  testing  to
measurement and assessment. Although EML moved organization-
ally  from  under  the  direction  of  the  Atomic  Energy  Commission  to
the  Department  of  Energy  and  then  to  the  Department  of  Home-
land Security, it never left its home in New York City.

The NYPD has found EML to be a responsive neighbor and part-
ner.  A  few  years  ago,  when  we  determined  that  we  needed  to  pur-
chase small, portable but reliable radiation detectors, we asked our
federal colleagues to recommend a laboratory capable to testing the
products then available on the market. We were told that we would
have  to  travel  across  the  country  to  the  northwest,  where  testing
would  consume  a  year’s  time.  EML  stepped  in  and  performed  the
testing  for  us  in  a  few  weeks  and  made  recommendations  that
work for us to this day.

As  a  result,  the  NYPD  has  acquired  approximately  700  hand-
held  gamma  monitors  and  120  gamma  neutron  detectors  to  detect
potential radiological weapons of mass destruction. They have been
deployed throughout the department and are in daily use through-
out Manhattan and access points to the city. In addition, advanced
gamma  detectors  and  Geiger  counters  have  been  assigned  to  spe-
cialized  units  such  as  the  Emergency  Service  Unit  and  the  Bomb
Squad.  The  department  continues  to  seek  out  and  acquire  new
technologies  to  aid  us  in  the  war  on  terror.  In  the  future,  we  plan
to  procure  additional  nuclear,  biological  and  chemical  detection
monitoring  devices.  EML  has  been  instrumental  in  helping  us
make  wise  choices  from  among  the  available  technology  and  the
available products.

Now, however, the importance of keeping a vibrant EML in New
York  City  is  more  important  than  ever.  Secretary  Chertoff  an-
nounced  last  year  that  the  Securing  the  Cities  Initiative,  STC,
would be inaugurated in New York City. Under STC, the Domestic

Nuclear  Detection  Office  at  DHS  has  been  tasked  with  developing
and  implementing  the  deployment  of  a  system  to  detect  the  intro-
duction  of  nuclear  material  into  our  cities  for  illicit  purposes.  The
EML plays a pivotal role in STC in New York City, providing tech-
nical and management roles.

The  Acting  Director  of  EML,  Dr.  Adam  Hunter,  has  served  as  a
key liaison between DHS and the myriad of federal, State and local
partners  that  comprise  the  STC  partnership.  He  has  served  as  a
mentor  to  jump  start  initiative  activities  and  has  been  a  key  advi-
sor  on  technical  details  regarding  the  acquisition,  evaluation  and
operation  of  radiological  detection  equipment,  and  he  has  provided
critical guidance on the operational exercise activities currently un-
derway in support of these initiative goals. Without Director Hunt-
er’s  guidance  and  assistance  from  his  laboratory,  the  STC  goals  of
creating  a  formidable,  in-depth  defense  of  New  York  City  and  the
region  from  radiological  or  nuclear  attack  would  be  severely  de-
graded.

In fact, EML stood next to New York City in our early efforts to
establish  a  defense  of  the  city  through  the  successful  Regional  Ra-
diological  Pilot  Project.  That  program  yielded  significant  research
and funding, which led to the fielding of discrete radiological detec-
tion  equipment  currently  used  to  locate  and  identify  radiological
source material.

Clearly,  EML’s  work  in  the  New  York  region  has  been  tremen-
dously successful and has provided a substantial credibility for fed-
eral,  State  and  local  agencies  to  join  in  a  coordinated  defense
against a terror threat of the radiological or nuclear attack against
the New York region. In fact, more assistance from EML would be
welcome  and  would  help  consolidate  the  initial  success  achieved
through the programs, such as Securing the Cities. The outcome of
that program will result in a significant increase in the number of
detection  equipment  deployed  by  STC  partners,  equipment  which
will need precision calibration and support going forward.

Also,  private  industry  is  rising  to  the  challenge  to  enhance  the
sensitivity  and  capabilities  of  radiological  detection  equipment  and
we look to EML to provide further guidance on acquisition, evalua-
tion  and  operational  deployment  on  technologies  yet  to  be  identi-
fied.  The  question  is  not  whether  EML  has  been  a  success  in  an-
swering  the  threat  posed  by  international  terrorism;  rather,  the
question  is  whether  EML  stands  ready  to  expand  its  efforts  going
forward. The success of STC in New York is important to the entire
Nation and we expect it to be a model for implementing similar ini-
tiatives throughout the country.

I would be delighted to answer any questions you may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JONATHAN A. DUECKER

Good  morning  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member  Sensenbrenner  and  Members
of  the  Committee.  My  name  is  Jonathan  Duecker  and  I  am  the  Assistant  Commis-
sioner  of  the  New  York  City  Police  Department’s  (NYPD)  Counterterrorism  Bureau
(CTB). I was previously the Director of the Office of Homeland Security for the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania. I am pleased to be here today and I thank you for this
opportunity  to  address  your  committee  on  a  matter  that  is  vital  to  the  health  and
welfare of, not only the State and City of New York, but our nation.

When Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly took office in January of 2002, the
pyre  on  the  grounds  of  the  World  Trade  Center  was  still  burning.  He  made  it  his

personal  mission  that  New  York  City  never  fall  victim  to  such  a  calamity  again.
Commissioner  Kelly’s  leadership  and  vision  was  the  nascence  of  the  NYPD
Counterterrorism Bureau. The mission: make New York City inhospitable to terror-
ists, and to their sympathizers, their supporters, and their facilitators.

Fortunately,  the  NYPD  has  thwarted  more  than  one  plot  against  New  York  City
since  September  11,  2001.  One  widely  reported  success  was  the  investigation,  ar-
rests  and  convictions  of  terrorists  planning  to  blow  up  the  Herald  Square  subway
station two weeks before the Republican National Nominating Convention. In addi-
tion, the NYPD’s robust deterrence and counter-surveillance program has proved its
success,  confirmed  by  Khaled  Sheik  Mohammed  himself,  who  cited  NYPD  deploy-
ments  as  the  reason  that  an  Ohio  truck  driver,  Iyman  Farris,  presently  serving  a
prison sentence for his role in the plot to demolish the Brooklyn Bridge, decided that
he could not carry out the plot.

In New York City, we are combating terrorism aggressively. We acknowledge and
welcome  the  synergy  that  comes  with  joining  State,  regional  and  federal  partners,
all of whom bring resources and expertise to the fight. Over the past few years, our
relationship  with  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  has  matured.  I  can  say
that, despite differences that crop up from time to time, the level of cooperation we
presently enjoy has never been better. It is in this spirit of cooperation and collabo-
ration  that  I  ask  you  today  to  ensure  that  critical  federal  resources  are  neither
squandered  nor  withdrawn.  I  am  talking  about  the  yeoman’s  work  taking  place  at
the Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) located in Manhattan.

The EML has distinguished roots, dating back to the Manhattan Project. It enjoys
a renowned reputation as the subject matter expert in all things nuclear and radio-
logical,  from  protection  to  testing  to  measurement  and  assessment.  Although  EML
moved  organizationally  from  under  the  direction  of  the  Atomic  Energy  Commission
to  the  Department  of  Energy  and  then  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security
(DHS), it never left its home in New York City.

The NYPD has found EML to be a responsive neighbor and partner. A few years
ago,  when  we  determined  that  we  needed  to  purchase  small,  portable  but  reliable
radiation  detectors,  we  asked  our  federal  colleagues  to  recommend  a  laboratory  ca-
pable  of  testing  the  products  then  available  on  the  market.  We  were  told  that  we
would have to travel across the country to the Northwest, where testing would con-
sume a year’s time. The EML stepped up and performed the testing for us in a few
weeks  and  made  recommendations  that  work  for  us  to  this  day.  As  a  result,  the
NYPD has acquired approximately 700 hand-held gamma monitors and 120 gamma
neutron detectors to detect potential radiological weapons of mass destruction. They
have  been  deployed  throughout  the  Department  and  are  in  daily  use  throughout
Manhattan  and  access  points  to  the  city.  In  addition,  advanced  gamma  detectors
and Geiger counters have been assigned to specialized units such as the Emergency
Service  Unit  and  the  Bomb  Squad.  The  Department  continues  to  seek  out  and  ac-
quire new technologies to aid us in the war on terror. In the future, we plan to pro-
cure  additional  nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  detection  and  monitoring  devices.
EML has been instrumental in helping us make wise choices from among available
products.

Now,  however,  the  importance  of  keeping  a  vibrant  EML  in  New  York  City  is
more important than ever. Secretary Chertoff announced last year that the Securing
the Cities (STC) initiative would be inaugurated in New York City. Under STC, the
Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) at DHS has been tasked with developing
and  implementing  the  deployment  of  a  system  to  detect  the  introduction  of  nuclear
material  into  our  cities  for  illicit  purposes.  The  EML  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  STC–
NY, providing technical and management roles.

The Acting Director of EML, Adam Hutter, has served as the key liaison between
DHS  and  the  myriad  groups  of  federal,  State,  and  local  partners  that  comprise  the
STC partners. He has served as a mentor to jump-start initiative activities and has
been a key advisor on technical details regarding the acquisition, evaluation and op-
eration of radiological detection equipment and he has provided critical guidance to
the operational exercise activities currently underway in support of initiative goals.
Without  Director  Hutter’s  guidance  and  assistance  from  his  laboratory,  the  STC
goals of creating a formidable, in-depth defense of the New York region from radio-
logical or nuclear attack would be severely degraded.

In  fact,  EML  stood  next  to  New  York  City  in  our  early  efforts  to  establish  a  de-
fense of the city through the successful Regional Radiological Pilot Project. That pro-
gram  yielded  significant  research  and  funding  which  led  to  the  fielding  of  discrete
radiological  detection  equipment  currently  used  to  locate  and  identify  hostile  radio-
logical source material.

Clearly, EML’s works in the New York region have been tremendously successful
and  have  provided  a  substantial  capability  for  federal,  State,  and  local  agencies  to

join in a coordinated defense against the terrorist threat of a radiological or nuclear
attack  against  the  New  York  region.  In  fact,  more  assistance  from  EML  would  be
welcome  and  would  help  consolidate  the  initial  success  achieved  through  programs
such as Securing the Cities. The outcome of that program will result in a significant
increase  in  the  numbers  of  detection  equipment  deployed  by  STC  partners,  equip-
ment which will need precision calibration and support. Also, private industry is ris-
ing to the challenge to enhance the sensitivity and capabilities of radiological detec-
tion equipment and we look to EML to provide further guidance on acquisition, eval-
uation,  and  operational  deployment  on  technologies  yet  to  be  identified.  The  ques-
tion is not whether EML has been a success in answering the threat posed by inter-
national  terrorism;  the  question  is  whether  EML  stands  ready  to  expand  its  efforts
going forward.

The  success  of  STC–NY  is  important  to  the  country—it  is  expected  to  be  the

model for implementing similar initiatives throughout the country.

I would be delighted to answer any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JONATHAN A. DUECKER

Assistant  Commissioner  of  Counterterrorism  Jonathan  Duecker  graduated  from
the United States Naval Academy in 1986 and was commissioned an Ensign in the
U.S.  Navy.  After  attending  Navy  flight  school  at  Pensacola,  FL,  and  receiving  his
Naval  Flight  Officer  wings,  he  was  assigned  to  the  EA–6B  ‘‘Prowler’’  tactical  elec-
tronic  warfare  community  and  flew  electronic  countermeasures  missions  from  sev-
eral  fleet  aircraft  carriers.  After  his  initial  sea  tour,  Assistant  Commissioner
Duecker was assigned as the Electronic Warfare Range Officer at the Atlantic Fleet
Weapons Training Facility at Naval Station, Roosevelt Roads, PR, where he was re-
sponsible  for  all  aspects  of  operational  electronic  warfare  training  of  surface,  sub-
surface, and aviation units prior to their deployment overseas.

Assistant  Commissioner  Duecker  attended  the  University  of  Wisconsin  Law
School  where  he  received  his  Juris  Doctor,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Wisconsin  Bar
in 1995. He attended the U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion  (DEA)  Basic  Agent  Training  at  Quantico,  VA,  and  was  ultimately  assigned  as
a Special Agent to the Mobile Enforcement Team in the DEA Philadelphia Field Di-
vision.

Immediately  after  September  11,  2001,  Assistant  Commissioner  Duecker  was  as-
signed  by  the  DEA  to  the  Philadelphia  FBI  Joint  Terrorism  Task  Force.  Subse-
quently, he was mobilized to active duty to the Joint Intelligence Task Force—Com-
bating  Terrorism  at 
(DIA)  providing
counterterrorism intelligence analysis in support of Operations Noble Eagle and En-
during  Freedom.  While  at  the  DIA,  Assistant  Commissioner  Duecker  was  respon-
sible for creating the Homeland Defense Division, which monitors the transnational
terrorist threat to the continental U.S.

Intelligence  Agency 

Assistant Commissioner Duecker was demobilized at the end of 2002. In 2003, he
was appointed the Deputy Director of the Pennsylvania Office of Homeland Security
by  Pennsylvania  Governor  Ed  Rendell,  and  in  2004,  was  elevated  to  Director.  He
served in that position until October 2005. Assistant Commissioner Duecker is cur-
rently  a  Commander  in  the  U.S.  Navy  Reserve  assigned  to  the  DIA  in  Washington
DC.

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  And  before  beginning  with  the
questioning,  I  mentioned  earlier  that  there  would  be  various  docu-
ments, but there is a specific set of documents that have been pro-
vided  to  the  Minority  staff  and  I  now  ask  unanimous  consent  to
enter that set of documents in the record. Thank you.

minutes of questions. Mr. McBrearty, beginning with you. I under-

stand  that  the  Air  Force  has  had  a  longstanding  relationship  with
EML, and the lab has participated in various nuclear nonprolifera-
tion-related  programs.  I  understand  that  some  of  the  work,  some
of  the  arrangements,  some  of  what  EML  has  done  may  be  classi-
fied.  Obviously,  if  we  ask  a  question  that  would  lead  you  into  dis-
closing classified information, do not answer that. If it is necessary
that  we  know  that  to  understand  the  answer  to  the  question,  we
may make other arrangements to get that information from you.

Mr. MCBREARTY. That would be perfectly fine.
Chairman MILLER. But in this setting, do not.
Mr. MCBREARTY. Right.
Chairman  MILLER.  Obviously,  do  not  disclose  classified  informa-
tion. And that goes for anyone else who has classified information.
Mr.  McBrearty,  is  AFTAC  now  engaged  in  any  program  or  project
with EML?

Mr.  MCBREARTY.  We  had  terminated  all  the  activities  that  we

had with them. So currently, no, we have none going on.

Chairman MILLER. Why is that?
Mr.  MCBREARTY.  Well,  at  the  time  we  had  both—some  of  the
points made here were excellent. We used their quality control and
the  engineering  support  to  a  large  extent  and  used  them  as  advi-
sors  to  our  activities.  The  major  reason  is  that  we  had—the  small
project that we did have was approximately $400,000 a year. It was
the  level-of-effort  project.  The  reason  we  terminated  the  activities
was, as I sort of alluded to and made mention in my written testi-
mony,  upon  notification  by  DHS  that  there  was  an  intention  to
close  the  laboratory,  it  was  absolutely  necessary  that  we  move
these  important  activities  to  other  laboratories  within  our  United
States Atomic Energy Detection System Network. We had to make
that  move  upon  the  notification  that  the  laboratory  was  to  be
closed.  So  while  we  value  it,  as  I  said,  very  much,  what  they  are
capable  and  have  been  able  to  do,  it  was  necessary  for  us  to  move
on.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  again,  how  did  you  learn  that

there was a decision to close EML?

Mr. MCBREARTY. In about 2005, in the fall, my project officer got
a  call  from,  I  think,  Dr.  Clarke  or  people  in  the  DHS  office,  noti-
fying  us  that  the  laboratory  was—they  were  planning—that  DHS
had  planned  to  terminate  the  laboratory  and  that  it  would  be  nec-
essary  for  us  to  move  our  work  elsewhere.  Or  the  other  option
given  to  us  would  be  to  pick  up  the  tab  for  it.  DHS  did  not  seem
interested  in  the  laboratory  or  what  it  had  for  their  particular  job
that they had identified.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  I  understand  that  EML  that—ex-
cuse  me.  The  e-mail  that  you  have  referred  to  is  one  of  the  docu-
ments that we——

Mr.  MCBREARTY.  Yes.  We  have  that  exchange  of  e-mails.  It  was
absolutely  essential  for  us  to  move  quickly  and  over  the  course  of
the  next  year,  we  transitioned  the  equipment  and  a  large  portion
of  the  sample  library,  which  is  a  nice  national  asset  in  some  re-
spects, to our other laboratories.

Chairman MILLER. Right. And Mr. McBrearty, I understand that
you  were  not  pleased  with  that  decision  to  close  EML.  What  did
you do about it, if anything?

Mr. MCBREARTY. I personally came up here from Florida. It is al-
ways  an  interesting  trip  to  come  from  Florida  up  here,  so  it  was
important for me to do so. I came up to talk with the people at the
Department  to  explain  the  importance  of  the  work  that  we  saw
going  on,  albeit  small,  with  regard  to  EML,  but  more  importantly,
to  sort  of  touch  on  some  of  the  points  that  were  made  in  here.  As
I  said  in  my  written  testimony,  I  was  initially  extremely  pleased
to  hear  DHS  had  picked  the  EML  up,  because  the  DOE  had  not
really  had  a  lot  of  use  for  them,  as  the  transitions  from  environ-
mental measurements and things were going on. The focus, as has
been identified, was more toward the larger laboratories. EML has,
and  had  had  in  the  past,  large  assets  that  were  rather  unique  in
the system. So in seeing DHS pick this little laboratory, but a very
competent laboratory, up, I was initially extremely pleased.

As  was  mentioned  by  Mr.  Duecker,  there  has  been  a  plethora  of
what I call Tricorders created for detection of radiation, and the en-
trepreneurship that is out there on the market to sell these things
is  huge.  Quality  control,  measurements,  validation  and  testing  of
these sorts of things, so that you have compatibility and things ac-
tually  work,  is  critical.  And  to  me,  that  was  a  job  that  EML  has
shown capability to do in the past.

So my initial impression when I heard they were being picked up
by DHS was great, this is a good location. I was disappointed, obvi-
ously, when the decision was made, or indications of that decision,
from  two  perspectives.  One,  we  had  to  do  some  moving  and  shuf-
fling  of  stuff,  which  was  an  impact  which  we  have  recovered  from.
But  I  think,  as  has  been  mentioned  here,  the  intangibles  are  the
things that worried me most.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  I  have  further  questions,  but  in  order
to  set  an  example  for  the  Committee,  I  will  now  recognize  Mr.
McCaul.

EML’S ROLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

(DHS)

Mr.  MCCAUL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Dr.  Fainberg,  I  want
to—if you could, tell us about EML’s infrastructure capabilities and
morale  prior  to  its  transfer  to  DHS.  I  wonder  if  you  could  expand
beyond  that,  whether  you  think  these  capabilities  fit  within  the
DHS mission.

Dr.  FAINBERG.  As  to  the  morale  before  it  transferred,  I  was  not
directly aware of it. I didn’t have close contact. The morale shortly
after  transition  I  can  talk  about.  People  were  very  happy  to  be
away  from  DOE  and  within  DHS.  Regarding  their  infrastructure,
as  I  said,  their  plant,  their  lab  space  was  fairly  depressing  and
barely  functional.  However,  they  did  have  laboratories  within  that
lab space that they did keep functioning quite well, supporting the
QAP program, for example.

And they had quite a bit of capability in radiation detection tech-
nologies. Their development of—I think it was a called comprehen-
sive monitoring system—was kind of interesting. This was a set of
gamma  ray  detectors  they  had  assembled  from  parts  on  the  mar-
ket,  but  at  much  cheaper  prices  than  you  could  buy  assembled  de-
tectors on the market. That became the core of their rooftop sensor
system.  Hooking  that  all  into  a  central  command  room  at  DHS

41

was—at EML was quite a useful thing to do as a demonstration for
what  one  might  do  in  the  future,  putting  a  radiation  monitoring
system  in  a  large  city.  What  you  have  to  be  careful  of,  you  don’t
want  to  put  a  million  monitors  out  there,  because  you  will  never
be  able  to  manage  that,  but  you  could  think  of  putting  maybe  50
or  100  monitors  in  strategic  places.  And  this  kind  of  work  was  an
interesting pilot for that.

As I also indicated in my remarks, some of the people there were
clearly  ready  for  retirement.  However,  I  identified  at  least  a  quar-
ter  of  the  technical  staff  who  I  thought  were  extremely  active,  up
with current technologies and good and many of them, in fact, were
useful  to  the  comprehensive—the  monitoring  test  bed  that  was  set
up by other elements in DHS in New York City. They assisted with
that,  where  they  were  out  on  bridges  and  tunnels  at  all  hours  of
the  day,  taking  measurements,  testing  out  systems  and  running
down  alarms.  What  they  could  be  useful  for  in  the  future,  all  of
that  expertise  in  radiation  detection  still  is  there.  I  am  not  sure
how many people remain in the radiochemical area. Reconstituting
that  certainly  is  possible,  but  it  is  not  certain  to  me  that  the  cost
benefit  analysis  would  favor  reconstituting  laboratories  that  were
there. It would be useful, however, I think, to use those people who
are  still  in  the  system,  who  are  still  federal  employees  there,  and
their expertise in helping other laboratories do quality assistance—
quality  assurance  work.  I  think  that  could  be  done.  There  is  a  lot
that  can  be  done  there  and  if  S&T  wanted  to  establish  a  serious
technological  presence  in  New  York  City,  nothing  would  prevent
them  from  hiring  a  few  more  people,  as  I  said,  younger  people,  to
reinvigorate it.

I would also suggest that they are really being ripped off by GSA.
That  is  not  a  good  place  to  be  and  the  prices,  I  understand,  are
going  up  for  the  rental,  because  the  prices  in  Greenwich  Village,
where this is located, are going up and GSA is able to match rental
to local market values. If it were up to me, I would try to put them
in  another  facility  in  the  New  York  area,  perhaps  in  Lower  Man-
hattan,  owned  by  other  elements  at  DHS.  That  probably  would  be
a lot more——

EML AND COUNTERTERRORISM IN NEW YORK CITY

Mr.  MCCAUL.  Thank  you  for  raising  that  point  and  it  is  a  good
transition. I was going to ask Mr. Duecker the value of having the
DHS Science and Technology footprint in Manhattan or where you
are located, in response to Dr. Fainberg’s comments, but also what
role  they  can  play  to  better  assist  your  counterterrorism  efforts  in
New York.

Mr. DUECKER. Yes, sir. In your opening remarks, you commented
that  this  was  critical  for  national  security  purposes,  it  was  a  crit-
ical resource. We take a very parochial approach to that in that re-
gard and we look at this as a very critical local resource. They pro-
vided  us  significant  test  and  evaluation  capabilities,  as  I  men-
tioned,  looking  at  the  rad  pagers  that  we  currently  have  on  the
street.  And  as  was  mentioned,  there  is  so  much  technology  out
there nowadays that making sure that what our cops on the streets
carry,  in  terms  of  detection  equipment,  in  fact,  is  going  to  detect
something that we should be watching for, is of critical importance.

There is a lot of technology out there and frankly, the New York
City  Police  Department  isn’t—we  are  not  the  subject  matter  ex-
perts  on  test  and  evaluation  of  this  kind  of  equipment.  We  rely  on
our  partnership  with  EML.  And  having  them  local  to  Manhattan,
and  having  them  basically  a  partner  within  the  city,  has  become
something  that  we  rely  on  to  a  great  degree.  Otherwise,  we  would
either have to go further up on eastern Long Island to BNL, which
is a laboratory about 65 miles outside the city, or elsewhere outside
the region.

And  in  terms  of  the  threat  to  the  city,  the  rad  threat  and  nuke
threat  to  the  city,  that  is  just  not  a  workable  solution  for  us.  So
we  look  at  the  partnership  that  we  have  with  EML,  Dr.  Hunter,
in  particular,  as  being  something  that  has  been  good  in  the  past
and we are looking to grow that in terms of the Securing the Cities
Initiative  that  we  currently  have.  Ultimately  what  we  want  to  do
is we want to create a ring of sensor technology around the region
to  protect  to  New  York  City,  because,  as  we  know,  New  York  City
is the primary threat set for the threats

Mr.  MCCAUL.  In  your  experience,  has  the  transition  from  EML
to  DHS  been  a  smooth  one?  Is  it  a  positive  experience  or  what
could be done to make it better assist you?

Mr. DUECKER. We have always asked for more. You know, if the
New  York  City  Police  Department  constantly  asks—requests  for
items  and  we  get  a  portion  of  those  and  we  are  happy  with  those,
but  we  are  always  constantly  asking  for  more.  I  can’t  really  speak
to the transition from DOE to DHS in that term, but I can tell you
that,  since  about  2004,  the  relationship  that  we  have  had  with
them  has  been  growing  since  2003,  and  we  would  like  for  them  to
stay  in  New  York  City  and  greatly  enhance  their  capabilities  in
New  York  City,  so  that  as  we  go  forward  with  the  rad  detection
system that we envision, we have a partner that is right there that
we  can  work  with  that  is  local.  I  mean,  one  of  the  things  that  we
rely  on  in  New  York  City  is  that  we  don’t  have  to  rely  on  folks  in
Washington,  D.C.  or  outside  the  region.  We  like  to  interact  with
them right there in the city.

Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you. I see my time has expired.
Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  There  should  be  ample  time  for
all  of  us  to  have  a  second  or  even  a  third  round  of  questions.  Mr.
Rothman.

DHS’ DECISION TO CLOSE EML

Mr. ROTHMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me thank you
for  holding  these  hearings  this  morning.  Let  me  just  start  by  say-
ing,  not  surprisingly,  as  a  Representative  from  the  northern  part
of New Jersey, across the George Washington Bridge from Manhat-
tan,  representing  that  district,  I  am  a  firm  believer  that  the  num-
ber one target of terrorists, New York City and the New York met-
ropolitan  area,  should  be  given  the  commensurate  amount  of  the
Homeland  Security  funding  and  counterterrorism  funding,  because
it is justified on the basis of risk.

In  addition,  because  of  the  quality  of  the  work  of  the  New  York
Police  Department  and  the  other  law  enforcement,  the  first  re-
sponders  in  New  Jersey  and  New  York,  we  have  come  up  with
great approaches to the threats and have invented the wheel, so to

speak,  and  so  other  targets  around  the  Nation  can  come  to  us,  as
they  often  do,  as  the  model  for  programs  and  it  is  a  more  efficient
use of the Nation’s national security or Homeland Security funding.
So  the  burden  of  proof,  in  my  mind,  should  be  on  any  agency  or
individual  who  would  withhold  funds  or  close  Homeland  Security
projects in New York City, or New York metropolitan area, to prove
why that is a good thing or necessary.

Here  is  my  general  question  to  any  of  the  panel  members  or  all
of  you  who  want  to  answer.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  Dr.
Clarke and I have read his testimony. Is the closing or the decision
to close EML, was that simply a good faith decision that people can
disagree  with,  but  nonetheless,  was  it  a  good  faith  effort  on  their
part  to  best  manage  the  taxpayers’  funds,  yet  accomplish  its  mis-
sion?  Or  did  it  evidence  some  bias  or  poor  judgment  or  pattern  of
bad management decisions that you would like to comment on?

Dr.  FAINBERG.  Well,  Congressman,  sympathetic  to  where  you
come  from,  I  grew  up  in  Hackensack  and  my  parents  are  still
there.

hand.

Mr. ROTHMAN. My constituents.
Dr. FAINBERG. That is a coincidence. I had no idea of this before-

Mr. ROTHMAN. Okay.
Dr.  FAINBERG.  I  was  told,  as  I  said  in  my  testimony,  that  there
had  been,  in  May  of  2005,  no  plan  to  close  the  laboratory  and  in
fact,  there  had  been  talk  of  establishing,  sort  of  in  its  place  or
transitioning  it  into  something  called  a  technical  liaison  office,
which  I  never  understood  and  it  didn’t  make  any  sense  to  me,  but
maybe  you  can  hear  about  that  from  later  witnesses.  It  appeared
to me that there was a decision to close it down and I do not know
why.  I  don’t  know  what  caused  it,  if  there  were  bad  feelings  that
had  been  generated  by  earlier  miscommunications  between  labora-
tory  management  and  headquarters.  I  don’t  know  if  it  was  just,
and  I  suspect  this  is  what  it  is,  the  difficulties  of  starting  a  new
organization, S&T, within another new organization, DHS, and as-
similating  pieces  and  laboratories  from  elsewhere  and  the  confu-
sion that reigned at that point. It may well have been a good faith
effort. I wouldn’t question that. I do think it was a very poor judg-
ment and that is all I can say about it.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Any other panel members wish to comment?
Mr. MCBREARTY. Yes, sir, I guess I would throw a little into this,
too.  Was  there  a  decision  to  close?  Yes,  we  had  the  impression
there  was  a  decision  to  close  the  place.  Was  there  bias?  Two  parts
to  your  question.  Bias,  I  don’t  know  that  that  was  the  case.  I  sim-
ply feel that there was a lack of appreciation of the intangible val-
ues  that  were  embedded  in  this  small  laboratory  located  in  New
York  City.  Two,  it  was  very  costly.  You  have  heard  indications  of
the  cost  of  doing  business  in  the  city  and  I  guess  that  comes  with
the  territory.  But  it  was  viewed  as  a  costly  operation  vis-a´-vis  the
new  organization  and  I  don’t  think  the  new  organization  appre-
ciated that it could utilize those—that it had those talents.

Mr. ROTHMAN. But you don’t see a bias or an under-appreciation
of  the  threat  that  New  York  City  and  its  surrounding  areas  were
under, vis-a´-vis the corn fields of Iowa or the sheep farms in Mon-
tana, who are getting a disproportionate share of DHS money?

Mr. MCBREARTY. Well, sir, I don’t know how the distributions go,
but I will say this, as I said earlier, I thought it was good that they
had  been  picked  by  DHS,  because  they  were  in  the  location  that
needed some help. There is analog to the DHS/New York City thing
in  the  Argonne  National  Laboratory  located  in  Chicago.  The  syn-
ergy that is derived by the presence and working closely with first
responders,  the  homeland  security  kind  of  initiatives  that  Chicago
has  developed  has  made  great  use  of  Argonne  and  to  me,  that
model was one I thought was going to prevail in the EML relation-
ship.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Rothman.  Mr.  McBrearty,
you  described  DHS,  the  S&T  Directorate  not  really  understanding
what they had. The image that comes to my mind is the last scene
in  the  Raiders  of  the  Lost  Ark,  where  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant  is
in  a  crate  being  loaded  into  a  warehouse  on  top  of  other  crates  by
a  forklift,  and  I  have  the  sense  that  they  don’t—they  didn’t  quite
comprehend  what  they  had,  from  what  you  have  said,  and  that  is
your  impression  as  well.  You  said  you  came  to  Washington  to  dis-
cuss  the  value  of  the  lab.  Did  you  give  a  classified  briefing  to  Mr.
Clarke or anyone else?

Mr.  MCBREARTY.  No,  sir.  During  that  visit,  the  venue  was  not
available for a classified briefing. However, the importance of EML
to  us,  in  any  unclassified  venue,  there  are  relationships  with  the
international  community,  our  associations  with  them  in  the  Com-
prehensive Test Ban Treaty development, development of samplers,
those sort of things, those values that we derive from this little en-
tity, those were those sorts of things I imparted.

Another  particular  bias  of  mine,  perhaps,  is  that  I  valued  EML
and  AFTAC  valued  EML,  too.  It  is  a  small  government  laboratory
as  opposed  to  a  DOE  facility.  Now,  we  love  the  DOE  laboratories.
We  have  great  associations  with  them  and  a  lot  of  work  that  goes
on.  But  what  EML  uniquely  provided,  in  my  opinion  and  it  is  in
my  written  testimony,  is  the  ability  to  independently  assess  tech-
nologies  and  do  so  in  a  very  capable  manner.  So  in  that  regard,
they were—that was part of the value or pitch that I thought EML
represented to the DHS.

MORE ON AIR FORCE PROGRAMS WITH EML

Chairman MILLER. Thank you. We have been called to a vote. We
will  continue  for  a  while.  We  all  have  a  very  good  idea  of  exactly
how  long  it  takes  us  to  get  to  the  Floor  and  we  have  15  minutes
and  we  should  be  able  to  at  least  complete  my  round  of  questions.
Did  the  decision  by  DHS  force  you  to  terminate  any  of  your  pro-
grams?

Mr. MCBREARTY. Is that directed to me, sir? Yes?
Chairman MILLER. Yes. I am sorry. Yes.
Mr.  MCBREARTY.  Well,  actually,  we  had  some  activities  with
which  EML  assisted  us  that  we  were  not  able  to  carry  out.  So  I
will have to leave that at that point.

Chairman  MILLER.  Is  that  because  of  the  nature  of  the  informa-

tion?

Mr. MCBREARTY. Yes, and——
Chairman MILLER. Okay.

45

Mr. MCBREARTY.—I would rather not go into that.
Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  And  at  that  point,  did  you  have
any plans to transfer or terminate or halt or cancel any of the pro-
grams  until  you  got  the  e-mail  telling  you  that  EML  was  going  to
be terminated?

Mr. MCBREARTY. No, sir, not at all. We and my staff had full im-
pressions  that  we  would  continue  operations  into  the  future  pretty
much as we had in the past.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  if  EML  employees  were  told  that
the Air Force was not any longer interested in working with them,
was that—that was inaccurate?

Mr.  MCBREARTY.  Oh,  absolutely.  We  were  basically  told  that  we
needed  to  find  other  places  for  our  work,  because  there  was  an  in-
tention  to  close  the  laboratory.  We  were  also  told  that  it  was  con-
sidered  private  information  and  that  we  were  asked  not  to  discuss
the  issue  with  EML  staff.  We  respected  the  fact  that  the  decision
had  not  been  made  and  we  made  no  contact  to  any  of  the  employ-
ees, per se, regarding that.

EML’S GLOBAL SENSORS: NORTH KOREA

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  One  last  question  and  I  think  we  will
all go to vote and then we will be in recess and come back and com-
plete  the  hearing,  and  I  apologize  for  the  herky-jerky  nature  of
this.  It  is  simply  what  our  schedules  are  like.  But  one  last  ques-
tion, Mr. McBrearty, and I know that probably you more than any
other  witness  have  to  tread  carefully  to  avoid  disclosing  classified
information.  But  I  know  that  you  must  have  been  aware  of  EML’s
network of global sensors.

Mr.  MCBREARTY.  Yes,  sir,  very  much  so.  In  fact,  we  were  close
with them on that and appreciated the work that they did in devel-
oping  that  network,  because  it  gave  the  monitoring  community  at
large a better capability.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  EML  had  installed  two  radiation
sensors  in  China  in  2002  and  had  plans  to  install  a  third  sensor
near  the  North  Korea  border  in  2005,  just  before  DHS  shut  down
that  program.  From  the  technical  expertise  you  have  in  this  area,
what  would  have  been  the  value  of  the  information  gained  from
those sensors?

Mr.  MCBREARTY.  As  part  of  the  expansion  of  an  international

network of samplers and a national or international——

Chairman MILLER. I am sorry. Excuse me.
Mr. MCBREARTY. That is a hard question to answer directly, but
always  more  samplers,  more  locations,  more  interplay  between
these  networks,  samplers  within  a  network,  is  of  value.  So  from
AFTAC’s  perspective,  with  its  job  of  worldwide  nuclear  test  moni-
toring,  we  have  always  been  interested  in  the  advancements  at
EML and the associations that they had with these things. To have
a  sampler  closer  to  Korea,  given  those  things,  a  joint  operation
with  the  Chinese  and  the  United  States  through  EML,  was  cer-
tainly a valuable undertaking and we were quite interested in see-
ing that as means of improving the ability to globally monitor those
things that all the nations who have signed up to this Comprehen-
sive Test Ban Treaty have expressed a utility in.

Chairman MILLER. And I know my time has expired and we need
to  go  vote,  but  just  one  last  question.  I  know  there  are  other
sources  of  information  about  the  detonation  of  a  nuclear  device
anywhere in the world. Was the information you would have gotten
from  those  sensors  duplicative?  Would  it  have  been  helpful  addi-
tional information?

Mr. MCBREARTY. It could have been supplemental, sir. AFTAC is
the operator of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System.
We  are  the  ones  that  provide  that  information  and  did  detect  and
report it on that nuclear test. For those sorts of things, we look at
the  entire  suite  of  systems  available,  both  United  States,  inter-
national  and  those  that  EML  would  have  had  and  it  could—those
things  could  help  under  certain  circumstances.  In  the  North  Ko-
rean test, they would not have helped because the situation is that
the  samplers  that  are  involved  or  were  involved,  whether  world-
wide  RMP,  or  Remote  Monitoring  Program,  have  to  do  with  moni-
toring particulate debris as opposed to the noble gases that actually
came  out  of  the  tunnel.  In  that  particular  case,  we,  AFTAC,  col-
lected the gases using our aircraft. So those samplers, per se, were
not—would  not  have,  in  hindsight,  been  useful  in  that  case.  How-
ever, if the event that occurred had vented, had thrown particulate
debris into the atmosphere, depending on the meteorology, depend-
ing  on  where  the  sample  was  transported  to,  they  could  have  in-
deed played a part, but that is a scenario that did not occur. How-
ever, the more is always better.

Chairman MILLER. All right, thank you. Okay, again, I apologize
to  all  of  the  witnesses,  but  we  do  need  to  stand  in  recess  to  allow
us to vote and we will back as quickly as we can. Thank you.

[Recess]
Chairman  MILLER.  The  Committee  will  be  back  in  order.  Any
moment, Mr. Rothman will be prepared to ask some questions. Mr.
Rothman.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Okay,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Commissioner

Duecker or Duker?

Mr. DUECKER. Duecker.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Duecker.  Thank  you  for  your  service,  first  of  all,
and  please  convey  our  thanks  to  all  the  men  and  women  that  you
serve with on NYPD.

Mr. DUECKER. Thank you. I appreciate that.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  You  just  do  a  great  job  and  thank  you  for  your
work  with  New  Jersey’s  finest  and  bravest  and  all  of  our  first  re-
sponders.

Mr.  DUECKER.  We  were  out  with  them  yesterday  carrying  the
Cities  Initiative.  We  were  with  Passaic  and  Bergen  Counties.  It
was  the  second  phase  to  the  Securing  the  Cities  Initiative.  There
is going to be quite a few more phases going forward, but yesterday
was a good day for us.

NEW YORK CITY FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Great.  As  you  know,  many  people  in  my  district
work in Manhattan and many of our first responders were the ones
who  came  into  New  York  City  to  help  out,  as  well  as  doing  a  lot
of the medical care at Liberty State Park.

Commissioner  Duecker,  there  was  apparently  a  report  prepared
by  the  employees  of  DHS  that  evaluated  EML.  I  think  the  report
is 2004–2005. That report painted a portrait of the New York City
first responder community as being lukewarm in its feelings about
EML. Do you recall if that is an accurate statement of the feelings
of the New York City first responder community at that time?

Mr.  DUECKER.  I  don’t  know  what  comprises  the  first  responder
community  to  which  you  refer.  I  don’t  know  how  broad  that  was.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Right.
Mr.  DUECKER.  I  don’t  know  to  what  degree  the  New  York  City
Police Department was involved in that assessment or that survey.
I  can  tell  you  that,  with  respect  to  the  relationship  that  we  have,
and  it  is  evolutionary  with  EML,  it  is  evolutionary  because  the
technology that we see in terms of rad and nuke detection devices,
that is evolutionary. Our relationship with them has grown. It has
grown more in the last year, I think, than it did in the two or three
years  previous  to  that.  A  lot  of  that  has  to  do  with  the  leadership
of  Dr.  Hunter,  as  I  mentioned,  and  his  willingness  to  be  a  partner
in  the  Securing  the  Cities  Initiative  and  understanding  that.  In-
stead  of  having  technology  drive  operations,  I  think  he  is  willing
to allow operations to drive technology and he is——

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Commissioner,  how  long  have  you  been  aware  of

the workings of EML?

Mr.  DUECKER.  I  have  been  with  the  NYPD  for  about  a  year  and
a  half,  so  it  has  been—I  was  aware  of  the  rad  issues  as  soon  as
I got there and the fact that EML played a pivotal role in the test-
ing of the rad detection devices that we have on the street.

EML FUNDING

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Okay,  thank  you.  Dr.  Fainberg,  Dr.  Clarke’s  pre-
pared testimony, in it he says that a review of EML found no S&T
project  manager  who  intended  to  fund  EML  beyond  2006  and  any
other  activity,  other  than  the  CMTB,  Countermeasures  Test  Bed
Project.  You  were  the  Program  Manager  for  radiological  and  nu-
clear  countermeasures  in  the  DHS  S&T  Directorate  at  the  time.
Did you plan to fund any projects at EML beyond 2006?

Dr.  FAINBERG.  Yes,  I  was  Program  Manager  until—I  believe  it

was late April of 2005.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Right.
Dr. FAINBERG. At that time, we were not planning anything very
much  in  the  fiscal  2007  timeframe  for  EML  or  for  any  of  the  labs.
We were kind of consumed with doing fiscal 2005 and 2006. My in-
tention  had  been  to  propose  continuing  funding  in  a  number  of
areas.  I  had  not  been  asked,  at  least  I  do  not  recall  having  been
asked,  if  I  intended  to  fund  them  beyond  fiscal  2006.  Had  I  been
asked, I would have said yes, I would have.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  In  your  experience,  decades  of  experience  in  your
field,  is  it  customary  to—or  for  people  to  ask  about  projects  and
their longevity several years beyond the present?

Dr.  FAINBERG.  It  can  be.  I  mean,  some  projects  by  their  nature

are large, long-term projects.

Mr. ROTHMAN. But your testimony is you just weren’t asked?
Dr.  FAINBERG.  Yes,  I  do  not  recall  having  ever  been  asked  if  I—
what I wanted them to do in 2007. In documentation that we were

supposed  to  provide  each  year  for  the  research  plan,  there  was  a
list  of  projects  and  how  long  they  would  last  and  how  long  we  an-
ticipated  they  would  last.  Some  of  the  ones  I  had  down,  like  the
ship  effect,  was  supposed  to  finish  in  2006,  but  there  was  a  possi-
bility it might have continued into 2007, for example. Other things
that were going on, like the New York area Science and Tech work-
ing group, were ongoing things which I would have wanted to keep.
I wanted to keep the global monitoring, for example. But a number
of  these  projects  that  I  had  wanted  to  keep,  I  had  been  told  at  a
higher  level,  not  by  Dr.  Clarke,  but  by  other  people  who  had  re-
sponsibility up the chain, that they were not going to be approved.

THE NEUTRON SHIP EFFECT

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  If  I  may,  just  one  other  question.  The  neutron

ship project.

group?

Dr. FAINBERG. Yes, neutron ship effect.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  That  ultimately  was  worked  on  by  some  other

Dr.  FAINBERG.  Well,  no,  it  is  worked  on  by  Dr.  Goldhagen,  even
today, I believe, in collaboration with RSL, a laboratory at the Ne-
vada  Test  Site.  It  also  has  interest  in  it.  But  Dr.  Goldhagen,  I  be-
lieve, is still working on that today.

Mr. ROTHMAN. So just forgive me. Was he at EML?
Dr. FAINBERG. Yes.
Mr. ROTHMAN. And then——
Dr. FAINBERG. As far as I know, he still is.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Oh, he still is?
Dr. FAINBERG. Yes.
Mr. ROTHMAN. So that work continued——
Dr. FAINBERG. That work——
Mr. ROTHMAN.—at EML?
Dr. FAINBERG. That work did continue, yes.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Then  I  must  have  misunderstood  you.  Was  there

some slowing down or hindrance of that work?

Dr.  FAINBERG.  Oh.  Dr.  Clarke  wanted  to  prevent  the  acquisition
of  a  detector  that  was  vital  to  do  the  work  properly.  After  people
at  the  higher  level,  the  office  director,  had  approved  it  and  it  was
over  this  issue  that  I  resigned.  I  said  it  seems  to  me  that  you  are
trying  to  block  something  that  you  don’t  have  competence  to  do.  I
went to my management and I said, why are you allowing this, and
my management ignored me.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  And  how  long  after  you  resigned  did  the  equip-

ment get approved?

Dr. FAINBERG. I don’t know. Probably within a month or two, but
I  don’t  know.  I  was  told  within  a  few  weeks  that  it  would  be  or  it
had been.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Well,  you  believe  there  was  a  causal  relationship

between your resignation and the acquisition of this equipment?

Dr. FAINBERG. I think so, yes.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

DIRTY BOMBS

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you.  I  understand  Mr.  McCaul  has  no
further questions of this panel. I do have a few more of Ms. Albin.
Ms. Albin, I mentioned in my opening remarks that one of the most
likely  terrorist  events,  one  that  has  been  amply  telegraphed,  is  a
dirty  bomb.  Could  you  describe  what  role  EML  might  play  in  the
event of a dirty bomb or any other kind of radioactive event?

Ms.  ALBIN.  So  far,  we  have  been  talking  and  implying  that  the
events that would be covered, people would be able to carry instru-
mentation  into  the  area  and  say  whether  or  not  it  is  safe  or  not
safe, kind of go or no go. Those hand-held instruments are good for
that, good for looking at first responder safety and good for making
a quick call if you need to evacuate an area.

In  the  case  of  dirty  bomb,  those  instruments  have  limited  capa-
bilities  and  it  really  is  going  to  be  the  radiochemical  analysis  of
samples that are going to give us the information we need to know
what is the extent of the contamination, if it was a dirty bomb and
unsafe. Can they come back to their houses, if they have been evac-
uated?  And  for  us,  and  a  lot  of  people  in  the  trenches,  we  are  the
people that are doing that analysis and we are handing our results
off to government officials that are going to make decisions and we
need  to  have  the  credibility  and  make  sure  that  we  are  doing  the
best  we  can  do.  So  if  we  are  analyzing  samples  and  we  are  giving
data  and  we  tell  people,  you  know,  you  need  to  stay  away,  that  is
one problem. But if we are also telling people it is okay to go back,
it is safe to come back, there is no hazard here, those no-action de-
cisions  require  that  we  have  a  lot  of  confidence  in  our  data  and
that  is  where  the  performance  testing,  like  the  QAP  program
helped  us,  because  it  independently  verified  the  work  that  we  do
and  independently  gave  us  that  assurance  that  the  data  that  was
being produced by the Public Health Laboratory can be used by de-
cisions makers to address those problems.

THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM (QAP)

Chairman MILLER. Okay. You mentioned the Quality Assessment
Program, QAP, and as I understand it, it set standards for labora-
tories to verify the reliability of their detection equipment. Can you
describe  how  Washington  State’s  involvement  with  QAP  at  EML
helped your programs?

Ms.  ALBIN.  Well,  the  QAP  program  was  directly  providing  our
samples  that  were  directly  related  to  the  type  of  work  we  do,  low-
level  radiochemistry  analysis,  so  that  is  how  we  used  them  with
the  QAP  program.  But  EML  also  had  other  programs.  They  spon-
sored  an  international  inter-comparison  to  look  at  external  radi-
ation levels, and there was another program where they tested the
ability for the analysts to correctly look at spectral data, and there
was  a  lot  of  interaction  with  EML,  from  the  QAP  program  as  well
as  availability  of  the  scientists  to  answer  questions,  to  collaborate
on  what  to  do  if  we  get  into  a  situation  and  we  have  a  problem
analysis.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  feel  like  I  am  talking  to  you  by  cell  phone.

You are kind of going in and out.

Ms. ALBIN. Oh, sorry. How is that?

Chairman  MILLER.  Oddly  enough,  the  Science  and  Technology
Committee  does  not  always  have  the  best  technology.  And  oddly
enough, our witnesses are sometimes worse than Congress in using
the  technology.  I  don’t  know  if  you  have  answered  this,  but  now
that  QAP  has  closed,  what  do  you  do?  Who  do  you  go  to  for  what
QAP formerly did?

Ms. ALBIN. We participate in other performance testing programs
and one of them is through a mixed—it is a program that is spon-
sored  by  a  DOE  lab  in  Idaho  and  it  is  developed  for  mixed  waste
and  they  augmented  their  program  to  include  some  of  the  radio-
nuclides  and  the  work  that  the  QAP  program  was  doing  and  their
performance  and  distribution  schedule.  And  there  is  also  a  private
laboratory  that  has  picked  up  quality  assurance  for  environmental
samples.  And  the  difference  is  that  we  cannot  fully  participate  in
the  private  laboratory’s  program  because  of  costs  and  we  are  lim-
ited  by  costs  and  the  government  samples  or  the  samples  from
EML  were  at  no  charge  to  us.  And  the  Idaho  laboratory  samples
are  similar  but  they  lack  some  of  the  natural  products  and  things
that were provided by the QAP program.

Chairman  MILLER.  Your  answer  to  this  question  seems  evident,
but if the QAP program were reconstituted in EML would you use
it again?

Ms. ALBIN. We would use it again, yes.
Chairman MILLER. Thank you. I think we are fine now with this
panel.  Thank  you  all  very  much  for  your  testimony.  Mr.  McCaul,
I know you need to leave shortly. If we could maybe take a shorter
break  than  we  would  ordinarily  take  and  we  could  have  you  ask
questions first.

Mr. MCCAUL. Thank you.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  The  next  panel  is  not  really  a  panel.
It  is  Dr.  Clarke.  So  if  we  could  just  take  a  couple,  three  minutes
to  stretch  and  let  people  reposition  ourselves,  we  could  begin  with
Dr. Clarke.
[Recess]
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay,  the  Committee  has  now  reconvened
and Dr. Clarke is our next witness. Dr. John F. Clarke is the Dep-
uty Director of the Office National Laboratories, Science and Tech-
nology  Directorate,  Department  of  Homeland  Security.  As  you
know,  Dr.  Clarke,  your  testimony  will  be  limited  to  five  minutes,
but you have submitted a written statement which has become part
of  the  record.  And  after  you  have  given  the  testimony,  each  of  the
Committee  Members  will  have  five  minutes.  We  may  have  more
than  one  round  and  we  will  call  on  Mr.  McCaul  first  to  accommo-
date  his  schedule.  We  do  swear  our  witnesses,  Dr.  Clarke,  if  you
would stand. Do you have any objection to being sworn?

Dr. CLARKE. No.
Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  you  also  have  a  right  to  Counsel.

If you could raise your right hand.

[Witness sworn]
Chairman MILLER. Thank you. Dr. Clarke, you may begin.

Panel 2:

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN F. CLARKE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, OF-
FICE  OF  NATIONAL  LABORATORIES,  SCIENCE  AND  TECH-
NOLOGY  DIRECTORATE,  DEPARTMENT  OF  HOMELAND  SE-
CURITY
Dr.  CLARKE.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member
Sensenbrenner and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. It
really is a pleasure to be here today. I want to thank you for hold-
ing  this  hearing  and  specifically  for  inviting  me  to  testify.  I  think
that  your  oversight  is  providing  the  catalyst  for  key  decisions  by
the  leaders  of  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  that  I  hope
will  allow  the  EML  staff  to  develop  a  more  productive  role  within
the department.

I have been honored to serve in the Department of Homeland Se-
curity since July of 2004. Like many of my colleagues in Homeland
Security,  I  was  moved  by  the  events  of  9/11.  I  interrupted  my  ca-
reer  to  devote  time  to  national  security.  Now,  for  me,  the  motiva-
tion  was  quite  personal.  I  am  a  New  Yorker.  Eleven  people  with
my  family  name  and  69  fellow  Fordham  University  alumnae  died
on  that  day  and  that  was  basically  my  motivation  for  coming  to
Homeland  Security.  I  was  very  fortunate  to  find  the  Office  of  Re-
search  and  Development  and  they  gave  me  the  opportunity  to
apply  my  37  years  of  research  and  management  experience  to  as-
sist  in  the  integration  of  the  DOE  national  laboratories  and  the
specialized  DHS  organic  laboratories  into  a  complex,  a  laboratory
complex that would serve the need of homeland security.

Now,  you  have  asked  me  to  testify  regarding  the  termination  or
transfer of programs, projects or activities at one of these labs, the
EML. You wanted to know how these decisions were made and the
impact  of  these  decisions.  My  written  testimony  addresses  these
issues in context and I apologize for the length, but it is a historical
record  based  on  extensive  written  documentation—and  it  has  been
entered  in  the  record.  Now,  the  extensive  Science  and  Technology
reviews  in  which  I  participated  found  that  the  EML  had  serious
challenges,  let  me  put  it  that  way,  to  overcome  with  regards  to
matching  their  legacy  capabilities  with  the  current  missions  of  the
Department of Homeland Security.

I assure you that to properly address this kind of issue, the tran-
sition of a laboratory, involves people and their past experience and
many,  many  factors.  You  have  to  approach  it  with  frankness  and
candor  in  order  to  make  realistic  management  decisions  about  the
future  of  the  institution.  And  these  judgments  and  findings  are
summarized  in  my  testimony  for  the  record.  But  I  wanted  to  do  is
to  assure  you  that  throughout  the  process  of  investigation,  review
which went on for oh, well over year, perhaps 18 months, the lead-
ers  within  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  at  that  time  al-
ways  acted  with  great  empathy  for  the  people,  the  individuals  at
the EML who, after all, had been caught up in a difficult transition
which  was  not  of  their  making.  Nonetheless,  the  Under  Secretary
and  his  predecessors  are  pursuing  an  important  national  mission
with  limited  resources.  They  have  attempted  to  tackle  the  difficult
challenges  associated  with  the  EML  forthrightly,  honestly  and  in
my view, courageously in order to blend the EML capabilities with

the  national  needs  served  by  the  Department  of  Homeland  Secu-
rity.

And  with  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  prepared  to  answer  ques-

tions.

[The prepared statement Mr. Clarke follows:]

Introduction

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN F. CLARKE

Good  morning,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member  Sensenbrenner,  and  distin-
guished  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  I  am  John  Clarke,  Deputy  Director  of  the
Office  of  National  Laboratories  in  the  DHS  Science  and  Technology  Directorate.  I
would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  the  transition  of
the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  (EML)  from  the  Department  of  En-
ergy  (DOE)  to  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  and  the  Science  and
Technology  (S&T)  Directorate’s  management  of  EML  since  its  transfer  in  March
2003.

In  particular,  you  have  asked  me  to  testify  regarding  the  termination  or  transfer
of programs, projects or activities at the EML, how these decisions were made, and
the  impact  of  these  actions.  In  previous  correspondence,  the  Committee  inquired
about  the  period  FY  2002  through  the  present,  part  of  which  predated  the  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS),  so  the  prior  history  of  EML  within  DOE  is  rel-
evant to subsequent DHS management decisions.

In  2004  the  Office  of  Research  and  Development  conducted  a  series  of  reviews
concerning  the  EML.  I  was  only  peripherally  aware  of  the  EML  during  my  service
in the Department of Energy. Consequently, when I was asked to participate, I con-
sulted  EML  staff  and  also  talked  to  current  and  former  DOE  officials  in  the  Office
of Science (OS), the OS Office of Health and Environmental Research and the Office
of  Environmental  Management  who  had  managed,  and  had  personal  knowledge  of,
EML from the late 1970’s until its transfer to DHS.
Background on EML

The  EML  is  located  in  a  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  office  building
in  lower  Manhattan.  It  was  transferred  from  the  Department  of  Energy  to  the  De-
partment  of  Homeland  Security  in  March  2003  by  the  Homeland  Security  Act  of
2002.

The  current  EML  evolved  from  the  Health  and  Safety  Laboratory  (HASL)  of  the
Atomic  Energy  Commission  (AEC).  HASL  contributed  significantly  to  various  na-
tional  programs  during  the  ‘‘Cold  War.’’  However,  the  laboratory’s  size  and  the
uniqueness of its capability declined as the global nuclear industry matured and na-
tional  priorities  changed.  With  the  formation  of  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)
in 1977, the HASL was renamed to EML to reflect its narrower focus on the meas-
urement of low level environmental radiation.

In  subsequent  years,  continued  changes  in  national  priorities  led  to  a  decline  in
EML’s  technical  capability  relative  to  the  private  sector  and  other  DOE  National
Laboratories  all  of  whom  possessed  broader  scientific  and  engineering  capabilities
and  missions.  According  to  officials  in  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  and  its  Office  of
Health  and  Environmental  Research,  during  the  1990’s,  the  DOE  Office  of  Energy
Research struggled to decide whether to close the facility or to find a viable mission
for  EML.  Finally,  in  1997,  the  EML  was  transferred  to  the  DOE  Office  of  Environ-
mental  Management  (EM)  where  it  provided  radiation  measurement  and  quality
control  services  supporting  DOE’s  internal  environmental  monitoring,  decommis-
sioning, decontamination, and remediation mission. Periodically, EML also provided
radiation  measurement  services  to  the  National  Nuclear  Security  Administration
(NNSA)  and,  through  an  Interagency  Agreement  between  the  Air  Force  and  DOE,
it provided similar services to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC),
both of which were concerned with nuclear non-proliferation.

Immediately  following  its  transfer  to  DHS  in  2003,  the  EML  continued  to  work
on the internal DOE Quality Assessment Program (QAP), which supported DOE en-
vironmental site cleanup, some radiation detector projects and two small and inter-
mittent measurement activities related to non-proliferation. By 2004 when the S&T
reviews  began,  EML  was  supplying  a  few  staff  to  provide  local  support  to  the  S&T
Directorate  Standards  (∼1.5  FTE)  program  and  Counter-Measures  Test  Beds
(CMTB)  project  (∼4.8  FTE)  in  its  testing  of  radiation  and  explosive  detectors,  per-
forming two radiation monitoring projects and offering advice and seminars to local
first responders.

Science & Technology Directorate Management Reviews of EML:

53

Since its transfer to DHS in March 2003, the S&T Directorate’s Office of Research
and  Development  (ORD)  had  numerous  meeting  with  the  EML’s  Director  and  staff
of  the  EML  to  inform  them  about  the  evolving  S&T  program.  ORD  also  provided
funding to EML to support transition planning and the Director had weekly discus-
sions  with  the  ORD  Director.  In  2004,  growing  concerns  about  EML’s  progress  in
transitioning its capabilities to support S&T programs, led to a series of reviews by
ORD. The first was conducted by Dr. Mark Mandler, who, at the time was the Tech-
nical  Director  of  the  Coast  Guard  Research  &  Development  Center  on  assignment
to S&T to assist with lab transitions.

Dr. Mandler’s review of the FY 2005 EML Facilities Plan revealed that the EML
had  a  carryover  from  FY  2004  of  42  percent  in  their  O&M  budget  and  26  percent
in  their  assigned  project  funds.  This  increased  S&T  concerns  about  EML’s  progress
in  managing  its  transition  to  DHS.  Further,  Dr.  Mandler’s  review  also  found  that,
despite the EML’s large FY 2004 under run, the EML Director’s funding projections
for FY 2005 staff were significantly overestimated and also contained inflated fund-
ing for self-initiated EML projects. It concluded that EML management did not un-
derstand  the  organization’s  actual  capabilities  and  entertained  unrealistic  expecta-
tions  of  its  potential  role  within  DHS.  The  final  conclusion  of  Dr.  Mandler’s  review
was  that  S&T  needed  to  reassess  how  it  could  utilize  the  EML.  After  review  and
acceptance by the Under Secretary, these conclusions led to the initiation of a more
comprehensive Top-to-Bottom ORD management review of the EML.

My personal involvement in the management of the EML began in the fall of 2004
when  I  was  tasked  by  the  ORD  Director  to  work  with  Dr.  Mark  Mandler  in  per-
forming this Top-to-Bottom review.

The Top-to-Bottom management review was to examine whether EML staff could
provide  more  support  to  the  S&T  Directorate  projects  such  as  the  ongoing  CMTB
project, which was S&T’s largest operational activity in New York and New Jersey.
It  was  also  to  examine  what  other  work  was  ongoing  at  EML,  what  S&T  programs
it served, what new work was proposed and what priority these EML activities had
within DHS. Finally, and most importantly, it was to determine how S&T could best
apply  the  resources  invested  in  maintaining  the  EML  to  support  the  science  and
technology needs of DHS components as well as the local agencies in the New York
area.

The Top-to-Bottom review followed a systematic data gathering process to answer
these  questions.  This  included  visiting  EML,  talking  to  EML  staff,  examining  EML
progress  reports  with  S&T  project  managers,  reviewing  its  quarterly  cost  reports
with  S&T  Chief  Financial  Office  (CFO)  staff,  discussing  EML’s  role  and  contribu-
tions with CMTB management and S&T Project Managers, consulting DOE officials
familiar with EML and reviewing EML’s new and existing work proposals in context
of  the  program  plans  of  S&T  managers.  The  review  was  completed  by  late  October
of  2004.  At  that  time,  it  was  decided  by  the  ORD  Director  that  the  results  of  the
review should be presented to EML’s management. The conclusions are summarized
below.

An S&T team consisting of Dr. Parker, Mrs. Alyce Bridges from S&T Human Re-
sources and I visited EML on Dec. 17, 2004. We met with Dr. Erickson and his sen-
ior managers and reviewed the S&T Directorate’s mission and goals with them. We
informed  them  of  the  conclusions  of  the  Top-to-Bottom  review  and  reminded  them
of ORD’s expectations for EML.

After  reviewing  S&T’s  current  and  future  program  directions,  it  was  noted  that
the  CMTB,  which  utilized  some  of  the  EML  staff,  seemed  to  be  the  closest  match
to the EML’s radiation measurement competency. However, Dr. Parker also warned
the  EML  management  team  that,  even  within  the  CMTB,  change  was  coming.  We
further  noted  that  the  ongoing  CMTB  test  and  evaluation  program  required  more
than  experience  in  radiation  measurement  and,  as  it  developed,  it  would  need  core
competencies  in  field  operations,  pilot  deployment  and  consequence  management.
We informed them that ORD expected EML management to engage in a serious as-
sessment  of  its  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities  and  barriers  to  its  success  in
identifying and serving DHS customers such as CMTB project.

We  then  reviewed  the  detailed  findings  of  the  Top-to-Bottom  Review  on  each  of
the  currently  funded  activities  at  the  EML.  The  review  had  found  that  in  the  area
of  standards  development,  urban  atmospheric  circulation  measurements  and  radi-
ation monitoring development activities, S&T program managers believed that EML
was not competitive with other institutions. Consequently, these managers expected
that  current  EML  activities  in  these  areas  would  be  completed  by  2005  with  little,
if any, follow-on work. The review had not found any S&T project manager who in-
tended to fund EML beyond 2006 in any activity other than the CMTB project.

The  review  had  also  gathered  mixed  reviews  of  the  EML  relationships  with  local
New York area government agencies. EML was recognized for holding seminars for
local government personnel, for answering their questions related to radiation meas-
urement  and  for  the  contributions  of  their  staff  to  the  CMTB  test  program.  How-
ever, the review found that Homeland Security support to local government agencies
was multi-faceted and required not only a broad range of technical expertise but sig-
nificant  skills  in  relationship  management  with  both  S&T,  other  DHS  components
and  local  agencies,  skills  which  EML  had  not  exhibited  outside  of  the  CMTB  test
program.

Based  on  overall  DHS  goals,  we  told  the  EML  managers  that  creating  an  oper-
ational  platform  to  coordinate  the  development,  operational  testing  and  transfer  of
homeland security technology to local government agencies was potentially a critical
success  factor  for  S&T.  The  CMTB  fulfilled  part  of  these  functions  and  EML  was
already contributing to its test and evaluation program. However, this participation,
while certainly valuable, employed only a fraction of the EML staff and was not suf-
ficient  by  itself  to  justify  the  existence  of  EML.  We  informed  the  EML  managers
that  ORD  would  be  performing  a  market  survey  of  S&T  technology  suppliers  and
potential  users  in  New  York  to  determine  a  concrete  value  proposition  for  such  an
operational  platform.  ORD  expected  to  evaluate  EML’s  future  role  based  on  their
institutional strategic and business plans and the results of the DHS market survey.
Following this meeting, S&T together with a team of organizational management
experts  from  Booz  Allen  Hamilton  (BAH),  conducted  dozens  of  interviews  with  po-
tential customers for, and suppliers of, science and technology services in New York
for  the  purpose  of  determining  a  vision  and  value  proposition  for  S&T  activities  in
New York. The teams also gathered information from several DOE National Labora-
tories,  other  government  laboratories,  DHS  component  agencies  and  local  agencies
both at Headquarters in Washington, DC and in New York.

The  teams  identified  S&T  operational  activities  in  New  York  of  value  to  a  broad
cross-section of homeland security technology suppliers and operational users. These
activities fell into four categories: 1) Providing operational liaison to maintain inter-
active  communication  between  developers  and  operators;  2)  Identifying  opportuni-
ties  to  exploit  emerging  science  and  technology;  3)  Spiral  development  to  evaluate
developmental technology in an operating environment and; 4) Providing continuous
technical  support  during  technology  test  and  evaluation,  insertion  and  deployment.
The  team  briefed  ORD  management  throughout  the  process  and  by  the  summer
of 2005, the ONL team was instructed to developed strategic and business plans for
an  operational  platform  to  perform  these  identified  functions:  the  Technology  Liai-
son  Office  (TLO).  The  TLO’s  value  proposition  focused  on  providing  relationship
management between technology developers and potential users to coordinate oper-
ational test and evaluation and on providing interactive communication and mutual
support between potential users and S&T developmental technology programs.

As recommended by the Top-to-Bottom review, ONL then evaluated EML’s poten-
tial  future  role  in  S&T  based  on  its  staff  capabilities,  its  institutional  strategic  and
business plans and the results of the DHS market survey and resulting value propo-
sition.  The  EML’s  leadership  of  the  CMTB  local  support  activities  (4.8  FTE)  fell
within the scope of the TLO value proposition. Unfortunately, when ORD compared
the  range  of  professional  skills  required  to  achieve  the  TLO  value  proposition  with
those skills extent at EML, it found only this small overlap.

This  led  to  a  recommendation  to  ORD  management  that  the  EML  should  be
phased  out  as  an  institution  because  its  capabilities  were  neither  competitive  nor
necessary  to  the  mission  of  the  S&T  Directorate.  Furthermore,  it  had  no  prospects
of  future  S&T  R&D  program  support,  the  skills  of  most  of  its  staff  were  not  suited
for  a  useful  S&T  operational  role  in  New  York,  and  its  operating  costs  were  high
and rising. The team also recommended that a TLO serving the identified customer
needs  in  New  York  be  established  and  that  EML  staff  and  capabilities  be
transitioned as far as possible.

ORD  management  accepted  this  recommendation  in  the  summer  of  2005.  ONL,
S&T  Human  Resources  and  Congressional  Relations  were  then  tasked  to  prepare
detailed transitions plans for the EML staff and facilities. This work was completed
during  September  2005  and  Under  Secretary  McQueary  was  briefed  on  the  results.
He  commented  on  ORD’s  thorough  and  systematic  preparation  for  a  difficult  deci-
sion.  He  verbally  agreed  that  phase-out  of  the  EML  was  the  right  thing  to  do  and
asked  that  a  final  decision  package  be  prepare  for  Secretarial  approval.  The  Secre-
tarial  decision  package  was  completed  by  ONL  and  forwarded  to  the  Under  Sec-
retary by ORD.

Under  Secretary  McQueary  announced  his  resignation  shortly  thereafter  and  the
Secretarial  decision  package  was  put  on  hold  pending  the  arrival  of  his  successor.
After  Dr.  Runge  was  named  Acting  Under  Secretary,  he  received  a  memo  from  Dr.

Vayl Oxford, Director of the Domestic Unclear Detection Office (DNDO), noting that
DNDO was planning a regional reach back initiative and proposed to use staff from
Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  and  EML  as  its  staff  on  a  part  time  basis.  This
request  required  modification  of  the  plan  for  the  EML  phase  out  and  the  startup
of the TLO. A second Secretarial decision package with these modifications was pre-
pared for Acting Under Secretary Runge. However, when Retired Rear Admiral Jay
M. Cohen was nominated to be Under Secretary of the S&T Directorate, this second
package was held pending his confirmation.
S&T Management Actions and Rationale:

While  the  options  for  the  future  of  EML  were  being  developed  and  reviewed,  a
number of S&T management actions were taken to address concerns identified dur-
ing  the  Top-to-Bottom  Review.  The  overall  intent  was  to  increase  EML’s  focus  on
transitioning its staff to viable missions within Homeland Security.

First ORD conducted a detailed review of the EML Program Execution Plan (PEP)
for FY 2005. This review was conducted for Dr. Parker and coordinated with S&T’s
Chief  Financial  Office  (CFO),  the  Chief  Information  Officer  (CIO)  and  the  project
managers  who  were  currently  funding  activities  at  EML.  For  this  purpose,  ONL
supported Dr. Parker.

With  respect  to  the  EML  operation  and  maintenance  budget,  the  PEP  Review
found  that  most  of  the  cost  was  due  to  EML  occupying  space  equivalent  to  more
than  an  entire  city  block—with  most  of  the  space  unused  for  years.  For  instance,
EML  had  six  chemistry  labs  that  were  utilized  over  decades  on  various  DOE  pro-
grams—primarily  for  sample  preparation  prior  to  analysis  and  data  acquisition  for
DOE programs. As the programs were reduced or terminated by DOE, the need for
maintaining these labs no longer existed but they were, nonetheless, maintained by
EML  management.  The  review  also  identified  traditional  EML  expenditures  that
were no longer necessary, such as a special EML security guard, in a federal build-
ing already secured by the Federal Protective Service—for which EML was also pay-
ing. It also found that EML was requesting project funds for activities that involved
little more than staff time, which was funded separately.

The  review  recommended  specific  operating  budget  reductions  to  eliminate  these
and  other  unnecessary  expenses.  The  review  also  recommended  that  the  unused
EML  space  and  facilities  be  decontaminated  in  anticipation  of  returning  the  excess
space to GSA.

The  ORD  Director  reviewed  the  recommended  budget  and  decided  that  it  con-
tained sufficient funds to allow EML to carry out all activities proposed in the EML
PEP that had any relationship to DHS goals. She adjusted the EML budget request
accordingly  and  reserved  the  savings  for  EML  cleanup  purposes.  The  result  of  this
review was to focus EML staff on actual DHS goals and ORD management was able
to  redirect  nearly  a  million  dollars  to  initiate  decontamination  and  disposal  of  un-
used and unneeded space at EML.

As  part  of  the  cleanup  of  the  unused  EML  Chemical  laboratories,  all  unused  re-
agents, materials, and equipment of value were sorted and offered to other research
institutions  (i.e.,  DHS  labs,  other  federal  labs,  State  labs,  universities,  and  GSA).
Any mixed waste or radioactive waste was collected and disposed of by Brookhaven
National  Lab.  The  empty  lab  spaces,  including  fume  hoods,  benches,  storage  cabi-
nets,  and  other  physical  structures  that  are  not  removable,  are  being  surveyed  and
decontaminated  for  ‘‘free-release’’  by  a  subcontractor  through  the  U.S.  Army  Field
Support Command. Other unused areas of the approximately 96,000 sq. ft. occupied
by the EML were also surveyed and are being decontaminated.

Given  additional  concerns  with  EML’s  management  raised  by  the  findings  of  the
budget  review,  the  ORD  Director  assigned  ONL  to  monitor  future  EML  operating
expense requests, including requests for travel, new staff, facility modifications and
information  technology  equipment.  The  travel  review  was  directed  at  eliminating
unnecessary  expenses  related  to  the  continuation  of  their  former  DOE  activities  by
EML staff.

The  IT  review,  which  was  done  in  conjunction  with  the  S&T  Chief  Information
Officer  (CIO),  was  aimed  at  eliminating  unreasonable  expenses  given  the  limited
EML  activities.  The  CIO  reviewed  EML  IT  needs  and  provided  connectivity  to  the
DHS network through four, rather than the requested forty, computers. These com-
puters were to be used for EML travel, financial and procurement activities and ac-
tive  CMTB  business.  The  existing  EML  computer  network  was  found  adequate  to
be used for all other business. Blackberries were provided to EML management per-
sonnel and those who were active on DHS projects outside of EML.

Much  of  EML’s  nominal  budget  in  FY  2004  was  actually  procurement  or  ‘‘pass-
through’’ for work at other laboratories, rather than to support local EML activities.
When  the  procurement  warrant  holder  who  resided  at  EML  retired,  the  S&T  CFO

56

and  the  DHS  Office  of  Procurement  Operations  (OPO)  determined  that  it  was  not
practical  or  cost  effective  to  replace  him  and  that  procurements  could  be  handled
through  S&T/OPO.  As  a  result,  for  FY  2006  CMTB  major  procurements  were  han-
dled  through  S&T/OPO  and  minor  purchases  made  through  the  EML  purchase
cards. From that point on, major CMTB procurements and funds for the Urban Dis-
persion  Project  was  routed  directly  through  the  UDP  Principal  Investigator  to  the
multiple  laboratories  actually  carrying  out  the  project.  The  effect  of  these  decisions
was  to  eliminate  unnecessary  duplication  of  effort.  However,  they  did  not  in  any
way reduce the technical capability of the EML.

The Top-to-Bottom Review had found that a serious impediment to the transition
to  DHS  was  that  some  EML  personnel  were  adhering  to  their  former  roles  within
DOE.  As  a  result  of  reviewing  the  proposed  EML  travel,  ONL  advised  individual
EML  staff  to  phase-out  their  roles  on  various  DOE  related  interagency  committees
and  activities  that  required  travel  without  a  DHS  justification.  Any  travel  that  re-
lated  to  active  DHS  functions  was  approved  immediately.  Compared  to  the  other
ONL  management  responsibilities  with  respect  to  other  DHS  Laboratories,  this
travel monitoring did not involve a great deal of money. However, it was extremely
important  to  refocus  EML  staff  from  their  identification  with  their  former  roles  in
DOE upon their current DHS situation.

Similarly,  the  Acting  Deputy  Director  of  ORD,  Dr.  Carolyn  Purdy,  detailed  the
EML Director to Washington to strengthen his understanding of S&T programs. He
is currently supporting the S&T Infrastructure and Geophysical Division. Dr. Adam
Hutter,  who  had  successfully  managed  EML  support  of  S&T  CMTB  activities,  was
asked to serve as Acting EML Director. Mr. Hutter has taken on the EML Director’s
assignment of defining a strategic and business plan for EML and has been working
very successfully with DNDO in developing expanded EML support of their regional
reach-back and testing activities.
Project Closures at EML:

Aside  from  these  internal  S&T  management  actions  aimed  at  eliminating  unnec-
essary expenditures and redirecting EML’s focus to actual DHS requirements, there
have been a number of unrelated project changes or closures at the EML. The Com-
mittee  has  inquired  specifically  about  four  of  these:  the  Global  Monitoring  Activity,
the  Quality  Assessment  Program  (QAP),  the  Urban  Dispersion  program  (UDP)  and
a  Reach-Back  Pilot  Program  (RPP).  Even  though  I  have  generalized  knowledge
about  these  programs  through  my  responsibilities  in  the  ONL,  I  was  neither  the
program  manager  for  any  of  these  projects  nor  did  I  direct  any  actions  be  taken  in
connection with any of these programs.

The  first  two  items,  the  Global  Monitoring  Activity  and  QAP,  were  never  DHS
programs  and  decisions  on  their  funding  were  made  independently  by  their  spon-
soring agencies.

The  third  program,  the  UDP,  is  a  DHS  research  program  that  was  started,  suc-
cessfully  executed  and  is  in  the  process  of  transferring  its  results  to  the  intended
recipients.

The last program, the RPP, was discussed by the S&T Portfolio Manager as a con-
cept  but  never  approved  or  funded.  Under  Secretary  Cohen  has  addressed  each  of
these  programs  in  his  letter  to  Chairman  Miller  dated  March  13,  and  since  I  did
not have programmatic oversight over those programs it would be more appropriate
for  others  to  comment  on  the  specific  facts  associated  with  any  particular  project.
Conclusion:

Unfortunately,  despite  S&T’s  identification  of  several  valuable  functions  for  an
operational  presence  in  New  York  and  the  joint  S&T/EML  efforts  to  address  the
problems  that  the  Top-to-Bottom  review  identified  in  2004,  by  the  Fall  of  2005  the
EML  had  not  been  able  to  find  a  function  within  DHS  that  matches  the  size  and
capabilities of the majority of its existing staff. This led Under Secretary McQueary
to  make  a  preliminary  program  level  decision  that  a  phase-out  of  the  EML  was  in
the best interests of both S&T and the EML staff. Changes in the S&T Directorates
management  delayed  the  transmittal  of  S&T’s  recommendation  to  the  Secretary  of
DHS for a final decision.

Of  course,  this  delay  has  been  extremely  stressful  to  the  people  at  EML.  A  year
ago, one of the EML professionals advised our Human Resources office that the lack
of decision was hurting EML’s professional demeanor, impacting mental health, and
hurting people in their home life. He was speaking for himself as a professional who
only wanted a significant job to perform but he also said that the situation was im-
pacting  everyone  at  EML  including  the  large  support  staff.  S&T  management  was
aware of, and very sensitive to, the difficult situation that the transfer to DHS had
created for the people at EML.

S&T management was, and continues to be, sympathetic to the difficult situation
of  the  EML  staff.  Since  the  transfer  of  EML  in  March  2003,  the  S&T  Directorate
has tried to provide responsible management which balanced concern for the people
at  EML  with  stewardship  of  the  mission  and  public  resources  with  which  we  are
entrusted.

Some  progress  has  been  made  in  the  one  area  where  EML  capabilities  matched
the  Homeland  Security  needs  that  the  review  identified  in  New  York.  The  Acting
EML  Director,  Mr.  Hutter,  has  been  doing  a  commendable  job  in  providing  EML
support  for  the  S&T  radiation  detection  test  and  evaluation  activities,  which  have
since  been  transferred  from  S&T  to  DNDO.  He  has  also  been  working  with
Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  to  provide  support  for  the  DNDO  regional  initia-
tive  in  New  York  and  in  examining  the  potential  technology  liaison  activities  that
might be addressed by his staff.

Under  Secretary  Cohen  has  indicated  a  commitment  to  right-sizing  the  EML  fa-
cilities  and  workforce.  This  will  include  both  supporting  those  individuals  working
on  the  DNDO  activities  and  transitioning  the  remaining  staff  to  a  productive  roles
working  on  S&T  programs.  We  all  look  forward  to  assisting  in  this  transformation.

DISCUSSION

MORE ON DHS’ DECISION TO CLOSE EML

Chairman MILLER. Mr. McCaul.
Mr.  MCCAUL.  I  thank  the  Chairman  for  accommodating  my
schedule.  Dr.  Clarke,  there  has  been  a  lot  of  controversy  in  terms
of  how  you  handled  EML  at  the  transition  time.  We  heard  from
Mr.  McBrearty  that,  in  his  testimony,  that  you  notified  AFTAC  in
December  of  2005  that  DHS  had  made  the  programmatic  decision
to close EML and my question is who actually made that decision?

Dr. CLARKE. Well, perhaps could I just clarify?
Mr. MCCAUL. Sure.
Dr. CLARKE. Dr. McBrearty’s statement. In fact, the AFTAC con-
tacted  the  Science  and  Technology  Directorate  and  myself  in  an  e-
mail,  which  I  have,  and  this  e-mail  said  that  they  were  preparing
their  fiscal  year  2006  budget  and  they  needed  to  know  what  the
status of our review was. This was a little difficult because our re-
view  was  not  completed,  which  I  told  them.  The  process  of  getting
a  decision  through  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  had  not
been completed. However, at the programmatic level, in the Officer
of Research and Development, the decision had been made to close
the  laboratory;  not  to  withdraw  from  New  York,  but  to  close  this
specific laboratory called EML.

Mr. MCCAUL. Who made that decision?
Dr.  CLARKE.  Oh,  sorry.  To  answer  your  question,  it  was  Dr.
McCarthy, who is the Director of the office, after many, many brief-
ings.

Mr. MCCAUL. Okay. Do you know if this decision ever rose to the

level of the Under Secretary?

Dr.  CLARKE.  Yes,  I  do.  After  the  final  decision  was  made  at  the
programmatic level, and I emphasize this was not a Homeland Se-
curity  decision  because  that  has  to  go  through  the  Secretary.  But
at  the  programmatic  level  in  the  Office  of  Research  and  Develop-
ment, I was instructed to prepare a package that would go from the
Under  Secretary  to  the  Secretary  and  that  package  contained  our
plans  for,  as  I  say,  the  closure  of  the  institution  called  the  EML
and  simultaneously  the  standup  of  a  new  organization  that  would
satisfy the value proposition that we had identified for S&T activi-
ties in New York.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  And  again,  did  this  rise  to  Under  Secretary

McQueary’s level?

Dr. CLARKE. Yes, it did. I was present at the briefing.
Mr. MCCAUL. And did he basically approve this decision?
Dr.  CLARKE.  He  agreed  that  this  was  the  right  thing  to  do  and
he  was  the  one  who  requested  that  the  decision  package  be  pre-
pared through Dr. McCarthy.

Mr. MCCAUL. Okay. And the decision was to close, just to explain

the decision, itself. How is it going to change the role of——

Dr. CLARKE. Well, as I stated in my testimony, this process went
through  three  stages.  First  was  the  review  of  what  the  reality  of
EML was, which was very staggering. The second review was, well,
since the reality of EML, as it stood at that time, was not contrib-
uting  much.  They  did  contribute  some,  but  they  weren’t  contrib-
uting anything commensurate with the cost of maintaining the lab-
oratory, that we better do an investigation and find out what would
be valuable in Manhattan. Dr. McCarthy was very determined that
if  possible,  if  we  could  a  valuated  mission  that  we  would  maintain
a capability in Manhattan. We did this.

We  consulted  widely  across  the  department  with  all  of  our  coast
and border protection, the FEMA, all of the agencies within Home-
land  Security  to  see  what  they  thought  they  needed  in  terms  of
technology  support  in  Manhattan.  We  consulted  with  the  Office  of
Emergency  Management  in  New  York.  We  consulted  with  our
agencies both in New York and in Washington. We consulted wide-
ly  with  everybody  that  we  could  think  of  and  we  came  up  with  a
value  proposition.  The  value  proposition  was  basically  the  types  of
things  that  Commissioner  Duecker  was  talking  about,  supporting
the  first  responders  with  certain  types  of  technology  support,  in-
cluding  the  Countermeasures  Test  Beds.  That  was  one  of  the
things that we found that was obviously of benefit.

But  it  only  involved,  at  that  time,  4.8  full-time  equivalents  out
of  a  laboratory  which  has  over  40  people  and  costing  us  in  excess,
at  the  time,  of,  as  I  recall,  $7  million  a  year.  So  you  see,  that  was
the reason behind all of this. We were trying to find a cost-effective
method of supporting both DHS operations and the first responders
in New York.

Mr. MCCAUL. And so that is a value added that remained in the

mission.

Dr. CLARKE. Exactly.

THE NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

Mr. MCCAUL. And what happened to the other core missions?
Dr.  CLARKE.  Well,  let  us  get  back  to  that.  The  only  other  core
missions  that  EML  had,  you  have  heard  the  testimony  about  the
QAP  program,  the  AFTAC  program  and  you  haven’t  heard  about
the  NNSA  program.  That  was  also  supporting  this  counter-pro-
liferation mission. In the spring, I believe, of 2005, in the prepara-
tion  for  her  decision,  before  she  made  the  decision,  Maureen
McCarthy  asked  us  to  consult  with  these  small  programs.  As  you
heard  from  Dr.  McBrearty,  $400,000,  involved  basically  one  full-
time  staff  member  to  service  that  program.  And  the  NNSA  pro-
gram  was  a  few  sample  measurements  during  the  year;  it  didn’t
amount  to  very  much.  But  she  was  thorough  and  she  asked  us  to

59

consult  with  these  agencies  to  see  if  we  made  a  decision,  at  that
time,  on  EML,  what  would  be  the  effect  on  their  programs.  We
didn’t want to disrupt the valuable programs of other agencies.

Mr.  MCCAUL.  Okay.  I  see  that  my  time  has  expired.  Thank  you.

MORE ON DHS’ DECISION TO CLOSE EML

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Dr. Clarke. Dr. McQueary is from
Greensboro, which is in my district and he is well regarded in that
community.  He  is  regarded  as  very  competent  and  has  a  high  rep-
utation for integrity. So this is not, the question is about these de-
cisions  are  not  personal  attacks,  but  they  really  do  go  to  the  cor-
rectness of the decision. Your testimony just seems to be irreconcil-
able to the testimony of all the other witnesses that we have heard
from  today  and  I  think  we  will  hear  from  in  a  later  panel.  I  know
that others were involved in the decision, from your testimony. You
heard  Mr.  McBrearty  testify  that  there  was  no  classified  briefing,
that  he  did  come  to  Washington  to  complain,  to  protest  what  was
happening to EML and to explain that it had an important role in
AFTAC  and  other  programs  by  the  Air  Force,  but  that  there  was
no classified briefing, is that correct?

Dr. CLARKE. No, it is not correct.
Chairman MILLER. It is not correct?
Dr. CLARKE. No.
Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Dr. CLARKE. Now, I have no personal knowledge of this and that
I  did  not  participate  in  the  briefing,  but  I  was  told  by  Dr.  Parker.

Chairman MILLER. Who is Dr. Parker?
Dr.  CLARKE.  Dr.  Parker  was  the  head  of  research  and  develop-
ment  in  the  Office  of  Research  and  Development.  He  reported  to
Dr.  McCarthy.  He  told  me  that  he  had  a  classified  conversation
with  AFTAC.  Now,  that  is  all  I  know  about  it.  I  don’t  know  who
he  talked  to  or  whatever,  but  you  know,  that  was  a  classified  dis-
cussion.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  at  that  point,  then  you  understand  that
AFTAC conveyed to the Air Force—conveyed to DHS the nature of
the  programs  of  its  programs  that  EML  contributed  to  and  that  it
would be disrupted by the closing of EML, is that right?

Dr.  CLARKE.  No,  that  is—I  just  testified  that  I  don’t  know  what

the content of that discussion was.

Chairman MILLER. Okay.
Dr. CLARKE. Because it was a classified discussion, I was not in-

volved with it.

could be in a classified.

Chairman  MILLER.  I  assume  you  have  security  clearance.  You

Dr. CLARKE. I could have been and yet I was not invited.
Chairman MILLER. Okay. Well, it was our impression the reason
you  are  sitting  there  today  is  that  we  understood  that  there  was
no  one  at  DHS  who  knew  more  about  EML  than  you  did.  Is  that
wrong?

Dr.  CLARKE.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  before  I  was  assigned  to  this
task  by  my  management,  I  had—I  knew  EML  just  by  the  name.
I  had  no  knowledge  of  it.  But  when  I  was  assigned  this  manage-
ment review task, I did due diligence and I talked to people in the
Department of Energy who had managed this EML throughout the

decades  and  you  know,  so  I  learned  a  great  deal  about  EML.  So
I  suppose  that  statement  is  true,  that  I  was—I  knew  more  about
it  than  anybody  else,  but  it  was  only  because  of  the  reviews  that
I was conducting for the Department.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Did  you  know,  from  Mr.  McBrearty,
that there were programs, AFTAC and others, that he regarded as
important  to  national  security  that  would  be  disrupted  by  closing
EML?

Dr.  CLARKE.  I  did  not  talk  to  Mr.  McBrearty,  initially.  I  con-
tacted  the  AFTAC  Program  Manager  when,  as  I  said,  I  was  re-
quested by my management to find out the effect of any change in
EML on their programs. I talked to a Mr. Scott Smith and we later
exchanged  e-mails  and  it  was  in  that  conversation  that—well,  let
me back up. The conversation was about a proposed trip of an EML
staff  member  to  China.  I  inquired  about  whether  this  trip  was,  in
fact,  requested  by  AFTAC.  In  the  course  of  that  conversation,  I
mentioned  that  we  were  reviewing  the  EML  and  its  role  in  S&T,
and  then  I  proceeded  to  the  question  that  I  was  tasked  to  ask,
which was, in the event that a decision was made to change EML,
and at that time, of course, no decision was made of closure or oth-
erwise,  if  a  decision  was  made,  what  effect  would  it  have  on  your
program? Mr. Smith told me at that time that it would have mini-
mal  effect.  He  mentioned,  if  I  recall  correctly,  five  other  labora-
tories that could do the work that EML was doing and that——

Chairman MILLER. And which work is that we are talking about?
Dr.  CLARKE.  We  are  talking  about  the  AFTAC  work  and  Mr.
Smith  was  their  Program  Manager.  Dr.  McBrearty  was  the  head
of  the  materials  division  in  AFTAC.  This  is  the  man  directly  in
charge  of  the  program.  And  that  occurred  in  the  summer,  before
the discussions that Dr. McBrearty was talking about.

Chairman MILLER. Did either Mr. McBrearty or anybody else dis-
cuss with you the national security implications, the importance for
monitoring of nuclear proliferation of the sensors in China.

Dr. CLARKE. Yes. I don’t believe this—well, I am not sure wheth-
er  that  was  mentioned  specifically.  As  Dr.  McBrearty  testified,  he
did come to see me in Washington. He was actually there, as I un-
derstand it, for a meeting at DHS and he stopped in and we talked
for  about  an  hour  and  our  conversation  was  pretty  much  as  he  in-
dicated,  that  he  expressed  his,  just  as  in  his  testimony,  he  ex-
pressed  his  personal  confidence  in  EML.  He  expressed  his  opinion
that  EML  was  a  valuable  resource.  I  gave  him  the  situation.  I  de-
scribed to him the situation that we had with a laboratory that was
costing  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  millions  of  dollars
servicing a $400,000 program, as he described it, which took up, as
I understand it, one full-time equivalent in EML.

It  was  servicing  some  episodic  measurements  for  the  National
Nuclear  Security  Administration,  which  took  up  a  few  staff  hours
several  times  a  year.  That  is  what  we  discussed  and  I  just  put  it
to  him,  I  said  it  is  costing  us  a  lot  of  money.  Your  programs  are
being  conducted  under  an  agreement  with  the  Department  of  En-
ergy,  not  with  Homeland  Security.  The  Economy  Act,  in  the  event
that something is done with the laboratory, the Economy Act would
cause us to charge you a lot more than you are paying now because

there  are  no  other  DHS  activities  that  are  being  supported.  That
was my half of the conversation.

Chairman MILLER. And did he say if you charge him more we are

not going to do it?

Dr.  CLARKE.  Yes,  he  was  astonished.  He  was  astonished  at  the
costs  that  I  related  to  him  from  the  laboratory.  Now,  he  had  no
idea about what else was going on in the laboratory, so when I told
him, basically, what is in my testimony, that we had not identified,
you  know,  work  for  this  laboratory  after  2006  and  he  recognized
that this was reality. This was not my choice, not his; this was the
Economy Act.

Chairman MILLER. My time is up and I do want to recognize Mr.
Rothman, but a year ago I was in Hawaii on a Congressional dele-
gation  from  this  Committee,  to  the  South  Pole,  to  Antarctica.  But
while we were in Hawaii on the way, we saw the device, the floata-
tion device that was to be towed and positioned. It is a massive de-
vice  with  radar  equipment  and  other  sensing  equipment  to  be
towed  and  positioned  in  the  Bering  Sea  to  support  our  technology
that  has  yet  to  succeed  in  intercepting  a  missile  and  I  don’t  know
how  much  we  are  spending  on  that,  exactly,  but  I  assume  it  is
many billions.

So  the  amount  of  money  that  you  are  talking  about  for  this  lab,
which  would  help  us  respond  to  a  dirty  bomb;  would  help  us  iden-
tify a dirty bomb before it detonated; would help us identify or had
the potential, if we furthered the research, to identify if a ship was
carrying a nuclear device, which strikes me as a much more likely
threat to the United States than a missile from the soul of another
country;  that  had  the  ability  to  tell  us  more  about  nuclear  detona-
tions  in  the  region  of  the  world  where  we  are  most  worried  about
proliferation,  that  adjoins  North  Korea,  India,  Iran,  Pakistan.  It
seems  to  me  that  no,  this  lab  is  not  that  expensive.  Mr.  Rothman.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Dr.  Clarke,  do  you
know  how  much  the  review  and  analysis  of  EML  costs,  this  18
month review?

Dr. CLARKE. How much it costs?
Mr. ROTHMAN. Yes.
Dr. CLARKE. No, I really don’t. It was some of my time. This was

not my full-time activity. Some of Dr. Mandler’s time.
Mr. ROTHMAN. You hired a firm called Booz Allen?
Dr. CLARKE. Yes, Mr. Hooks, our Deputy Director had a contract
with Booz Allen, it is our ASETA contract for technical support and
he  arranged  to  have  a  team  of  about  four  people,  but  they  didn’t
work full-time on this.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Can  we  get  that  for  the  record?  Is  it  possible——
Dr.  CLARKE.  I  don’t  have  that  information,  but  I  am  sure  it  can

be provided.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Can you provide it?
Dr. CLARKE. I cannot provide it. It wasn’t my contract.

LIMITED DHS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY DIRECTORATE

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Okay.  Doctor,  you  said  that  S&T  was,  I  believe
you  were  referring  to  S&T,  was  involved  in  an  important  national
mission with limited resources.

Dr. CLARKE. Yes, sir. My personal view, but——
Mr. ROTHMAN. Yes. Do you think it is being under-funded by the

Dr.  CLARKE.  Congressman,  that  is  a  policy  question.  It  is  way

Congress?

above my pay grade.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Do you have an opinion?
Dr. CLARKE. On whether——
Mr. ROTHMAN. It is under-funded.
Dr. CLARKE. Let me put it this way. I attend reviews of the pro-
grams  that  we  have.  I  look  at  the  yearly  budgeted  activities  and
there  are  always  projects  that  appear  to  be  very,  very  worthwhile
projects  that  fall  above  the  funding  level  that  the  directorate  has.
Now,  they  say  that  is  a  policy  issue.  That  is  not  for  me  to  decide.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Have  you  ever  gone  to  your  superiors  and  said
there  is  a  program  that  needs  to  be  funded  and  for  whatever  rea-
son they have said we don’t have the money for that?

Dr.  CLARKE.  No,  sir.  I  have  not  had  any  programmatic  responsi-
bility  while  I  was  at  Science  and  Technology  directorate.  I  offered
management advice and analysis to my superiors when asked.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Did  you  call  those  resources  limited?  I  suppose  it

just—you meant nothing by that?

Dr. CLARKE. Well, what I meant was what I just said, that I see,
in  the  budget  process  every  year,  projects  that  look  like  they  are
worthy  projects  that  have  been  requested  by  customers  for  the
Science  and  Technology  directorate  and  they  are  not  funded.  That
is what I meant.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  But  it  hasn’t  been  under  your  jurisdiction  to——
Dr. CLARKE. No, not my responsibility.
Mr. ROTHMAN.—to comment on their being not funded?
Dr. CLARKE. No, sir.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  I  think  I  followed  the  chronology  in  your  written
testimony  and  in  the  remarks  that  you  made.  If  I  have  got  it  cor-
rect,  at  some  point  new  people  came  in  and  changed  the  decision
that had been made with regards to EML? Is that a fair character-
ization or how would you characterize it?

Dr.  CLARKE.  Actually,  that  is  a  very  good  question  and  if  I  may
just  respond  completely.  I  don’t  want  to  waste  your  time  if  you
have  others,  but  there  seems  to  be  a  misunderstanding  about  the
term  closure.  I  tried  to  indicate  before,  in  my  previous  remarks,
that  when  we  were  using  the  work  closure,  we  were  using  that
with  respect  to  an  organizational  entity  with  the  title  Environ-
mental  Measurements  Laboratory  because  frankly,  even  that  title
is not appropriate for this department.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  No,  I  understand.  I  am  not  asking  about  the  clo-

Dr. CLARKE. Okay.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Whatever  changes  you  were  going  to  make  with
regards to EML. Apparently, some or all of those decisions were re-
voked,  made  null  and  void,  find  new  leadership?  Can  you  com-
ment? Is that true?

Dr. CLARKE. I would say not. If you look at the value proposition
that  we  identified  through  all  of  our  work  in  New  York,  which  is
recorded  in  my  testimony,  and  then  you  look  at  the  decisions  that
will  be  discussed  by  Admiral  Cohen  and  Mr.  Oxford,  you  will  see

sure.

that  there  is  a  strong  overlap.  Supporting  the  testing  and  evalua-
tion  that  Mr.  Duecker  talked  was  in  there,  that  was  part  of  our
value proposition.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Excuse  me,  Doctor.  Just  refer,  if  I  may,  to  part
of  your  written  testimony.  At  several  different  places  in  your  writ-
ten  testimony  you  say  that  because  an  under  secretary  or  some-
body  retired  or  resigned,  new  people  were  coming  in,  that  rec-
ommendations to the Secretary were never acted upon.

Dr. CLARKE. Um-hum, that is correct.
Mr. ROTHMAN. So is it fair to say, then, that those recommenda-

tions that you made have still not been acted upon?

Dr. CLARKE. That is correct, yes. Yes. At least at the Secretarial

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  They  haven’t  been  acted  upon,  period?  They

level. That is correct, yes.

haven’t been effectuated.

Dr. CLARKE. That is correct.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Please go ahead.
Dr.  CLARKE.  No,  I  thought  you  were  asking  me,  at  least  what  I
heard  was  that  you  said  that  the  recommendations  were  revoked
and——

Mr. ROTHMAN. Okay.
Dr.  CLARKE.—the  decision  didn’t  go  forward.  What  I  was  trying

to emphasize was——

Mr. ROTHMAN. They just haven’t been effectuated.
Dr. CLARKE. That is correct.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  The  18  months’  review  and  the  recommendations

have never been effectuated by DHS.

Dr. CLARKE. Yes, sir.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Thank you.

MORE ON THE FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY IN NEW YORK

CITY

Chairman MILLER. A few more questions, Dr. Clarke. One of the
reasons  that  you  have  consistently  given  was  the  relatively  low
value  assigned  to  EML.  It  had  little  credibility  among  first  re-
sponders  in  New  York.  We  asked  the  police  to  send  us  someone  to
testify.  They  sent  us  Deputy  Commissioner  Duecker  and  the  gist
of  his  testimony  was  we  love  those  guys.  I  understand,  from  our
staff,  that  we  have  talked  to  that  they  have  talked  to  all  the  first
responders; the police, the fire, the EMS, in New York City and ad-
joining  areas  and  consistently  they  hear  the  same  thing,  that  Mr.
Duecker said today, which was that they thought that EML’s work
was  outstanding.  It  was  the  gold  standard  in  radiation  monitoring
and  detection  and  analysis.  From  whom  did  you  hear  that  EML
had a poor reputation, it had little credibility among first respond-
ers?

Dr.  CLARKE.  From  the  people  that  we  interviewed.  From  the
FEMA  Director  in  New  York,  from  the  people  in  the  Office  of
Emergency  Management.  Let  us  be  clear.  What  Mr.  Duecker  was
talking  about  was  the  work  that  was  supervised  by  Adam  Hunter
in  the  Countermeasure  Test  Bed  doing  testing  and  evaluation  of
radiation  detectors,  which  he  feels  is  so  important  for  the  City  of
New  York.  That  work  was  never  questioned.  That  work  was  never
intended  to  be  closed  down.  But  that  work  was  a  very  small  part

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

64

of  what  we  are  talking  about  here,  which  is  the  larger  EML.  The
management issue that we had was what do we do with this larger
part  of  the  EML  which  is  not  being  employed,  with  no  disrespect
and  a  great  deal  of  respect  for  the  productive  activities  led  by  Dr.
Hunter.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  did  you  talk  to  the  first  responders  per-

sonally or you kind of heard it through the grape vine?

Dr.  CLARKE.  I  didn’t  talk  to  first  responders.  I  mean,  there  are

40,000 police in New York and——

Chairman MILLER. No, did you talk to the leadership of the first

responders, the emergency response folks?

Dr.  CLARKE.  I  talked  to  operational  DHS  elements  in  New  York
and the Office of Emergency Management, which has the job of co-
ordinating all first response in New York. I did not talk directly to
the police or the fire department.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  And  can  you  identify,  for  our  staff,
after this hearing, the folks that you did talk to and if you had cor-
respondence by e-mail, can we see the e-mail exchange?

Dr. CLARKE. Well, you should have it. I gave you everything that

I had in my computer.

Chairman MILLER. Have we gotten that? Okay. Mr. Rothman.
Mr. ROTHMAN. I have another meeting of a bunch of folks on an-
other  important  matter,  but  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  for  allow-
ing  me  to  ask  this  question.  Dr.  Clarke,  do  you  have  an  opinion
about as to whether the, as a consequence of the 18 month review,
the work of EML was affected positively, negatively, no effect, hurt
their  operations,  slowed  them  down  or  not?  And  if  so,  could  you
share that with us, your opinion?

Dr.  CLARKE.  Actually,  I  was  very  pleased  to  hear  Mr.  Duecker’s
testimony  in  which  he  said  that  the  contact  and  the  support  from
EML  to  the  New  York  Police  Department  greatly  accelerated  over
the  last  year  and  a  half  and  I  believe  that  is  in  the  record  from
his testimony. So in the area in which the EML was making a posi-
tive  contribution,  namely,  the  test  evaluation  work  led  by  Dr.
Hunter, that work has improved.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Well,  he  only  was  there  for  a  year  and  a  half,  so
he  said  for  the  year  and  a  half  he  was  there  they  worked  well  to-
gether.

Dr. CLARKE. I am working from memory here but we can look at

what he said. I believe that is what I heard.

Mr. ROTHMAN. I think he has only been there a year and a half.
Dr.  CLARKE.  But  then  he  did  say  that  it  had  accelerated  over

that period.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Over this last year and a half.
Dr.  CLARKE.  Which  is  what  you  asked  me,  whether  as  a  result

of our actions, I could venture an opinion.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Well, when were the recommendations shelved or
that you made not acted upon? If you will understand what I mean.
I can go back into your testimony, if you don’t remember.

Dr. CLARKE. I do.
Mr. ROTHMAN. You do?
Dr.  CLARKE.  Yes,  the  first  package  we  submitted  was  in  Decem-

ber.

Mr. ROTHMAN. Yes. Of what year?

Dr. CLARKE. Of 2005.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Right.
Dr.  CLARKE.  That  was  when  Secretary  McQueary  was  still  the
Under Secretary. In planning for the transition of EML, we had to
figure  out  how  to  preserve  the  valuable  sections  of  the  laboratory
and what we should do about the people that——

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  But  is  it  fair  to  say  that  your  18  month  review

concluded in December of 2005 or no?

Dr. CLARKE. I would say so, yes.
Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Okay.  And  that  is  about  the  time  he  got  his  job,

Mr. Duecker?

Dr. CLARKE. Yes.
Mr. ROTHMAN. Okay. So during the 18 months that preceded De-
cember  2005,  do  you  have  an  opinion  as  to  whether  that  review
process affected EML during that time up to December 2005?

Dr.  CLARKE.  Yes.  Now,  this  is  a  much  narrower  answer  because
it is with respect to the management of a small special purpose lab-
oratory.  In  my  view,  it  did  improve.  When  we  began  this  review,
there  were  a  number  of  EML  staff  who  were  traveling  around,
spending  public  money  on  behalf  of  their  interests  in  carrying  out
the roles that they had formerly been responsible for in the Depart-
ment  of  Energy.  That  was  stopped.  And  my  own  opinion,  based  on
a  certain  amount  of  experience  in  management  is  that  this  was
good  for  the  staff  because  it  focused  their  attention  on  their  new
role in the Department of Homeland Security, rather than their old
role.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  So  overall,  would  you  say  this  18  month  review

had a positive, negative or neutral effect on EML?

Dr. CLARKE. Overall, I would say, taking account of the stress on
the  staff  from  the  lack  of  decision,  I  would  say  that  it  was  a  ter-
rible burden on the staff.

Mr.  ROTHMAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  am  allowed  to  come  back  by
my staff, I would like to ask that question of the next panel. If not,
Mr. Chairman, if it is possible for somebody to ask that same ques-
tion  to  the  next  panel?  I  appreciate  your  testimony,  Doctor,  and
thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MORE ON DHS’ DECISION TO CLOSE EML

Chairman MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Rothman. Just a couple more
questions, Dr. Clarke. Dr. Fainberg testified here this morning that
he  fought  to  fund  various  projects  at  EML.  The  global  radiation
monitoring  program,  their  rooftop  radiation  sensors—and  I  think
others, and he testified that he consistently advocated for that and
resigned  out  of  frustration.  And  your  testimony  was,  today,  your
written  testimony  is  that  there  was  no  project  manager  who  in-
tended to fund EML beyond 2006. No S&T project manager who in-
tended  to  fund  EML  beyond  2006  and  any  activity  other  than  the
Countermeasure  Test  Bed  project.  Now,  Dr.  Fainberg  was  an  S&T
project manager, isn’t that right?

Dr. CLARKE. That is correct.
Chairman MILLER. Is his testimony incorrect?
Dr. CLARKE. Well, in part and I believe he said that he was never
asked  or  he  couldn’t  remember  whether  he  was  asked  and  he  cer-
tainly  was.  One  of  the  first  stops  when  Dr.  Mandler  and  I  were

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

66

conducting the initial review of EML was to interview him because
he was funding most of the ongoing activities at EML. And at that
time,  he  gave  us  some  very  frank  evaluations  of  the  worth  of  the
projects.  Now,  what  he  said  in  his  testimony  was  that  he  felt  they
had  some  value.  Well,  as  I  testified,  the  competition  for  funding  of
worthwhile  projects  in  Science  and  Technology  is  very  fierce  and
just  because  something  has  some  value  doesn’t  mean  that  it  nec-
essarily will be approved. Now, I personally did not make any deci-
sions  on  the  funding  of  any  project  at  EML.  Those  decisions  were
made by Dr. Jerry Parker.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Clarke,  I  am  just  struck  by  the  fact  that
you  and  I  seem  to  have  heard  different  testimony  just  an  hour  or
so ago. I didn’t detect any ambivalence in Dr. Fainberg’s testimony
about the value of EML’s programs. I detected in him great frustra-
tion  and  that  certainly  is  consistent  with  the  e-mail  that  he  sent,
resigning,  in  which  he  said  John  Clarke  is  reaching  into  my  pro-
gram,  preventing  me  from  carrying  it  out  under  the  guise  of  exer-
cising  his  authority  over  EML.  He  has  a  clear  aim  of  eliminating
as  much  of  EML’s  work  for  me  as  he  could.  It  goes  on  and  on.  I
am sure you must have seen this e-mail.

Dr. CLARKE. I have seen several e-mails, yes.
Chairman  MILLER.  Well,  this  is  actually  to  Maureen  McCarthy.
Dr. CLARKE. Yes, sir.
Chairman  MILLER.  It  does  not  show  a  cc  to  you.  It  does  show  to
Dr.  Parker  and  Robert  Hooks  and  Carol  Linder,  but  I  assume
that——

Dr.  CLARKE.  Dr.  Parker  shared  this  with  me  after  the  fact  and

so what he says in this e-mail is not correct.
Chairman MILLER. Is that your testimony?
Dr.  CLARKE.  No,  I  am  not  challenging  Dr.  Fainberg’s  opinions.
They  are  his  opinions.  His  opinions  were  not  accepted  by  manage-
ment,  not  accepted  by  Dr.  Parker  or  Carolyn  Purdy,  for  example.
They were present at the final discussion that led to Dr. Fainberg’s
decision.  I  was  not  involved.  I  was  not  there.  I  was  informed  after
the  fact.  So  I  am  not  challenging  his  opinions,  but  they  are  his
opinions.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  It  seems  that  that  is  a  very  different
take, that he had opinions that you considered but rejected, rather
than what you—it sounded to me like you said, a moment ago, that
he candidly talked about the programs of questionable value.

Dr. CLARKE. We are talking about a period of about four months
and what I just said about the initial interview between myself and
Dr.  Mandler  and  Tony  Fainberg,  and  there  was  another  person
present,  the  contractor,  whose  name  escapes  me.  We  had  a  very
frank  discussion  about  the  value  of  these  programs.  The  issue  we
are  talking  about  now  occurred  four  months  later  and  it  was  be-
tween  Dr.  Parker,  Dr.  Purdy  and  apparently  Dr.  McCarthy.  I  had
nothing to do with that.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Is  it  true  that  Dr.  Fainberg  wanted  to
continue  funding  and  increase  funding  for  the  EML  labs,  for  the
EML programs? That he advocated for that?

Dr.  CLARKE.  Yes.  He  mentioned  a  couple  of  specific  projects.  A
neutron ship effect which was, in fact, continued. It is still ongoing.
He commented on the—if I remember correctly and I am just work-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

67

ing  from  memory,  he  commented  on  the  seminars  that  were  held
for the New York first responders. Those programs were continued
and  are  continuing  today.  There  was  one  just  recently.  I  can’t  re-
member  what  else  he  commented  on  specifically.  So  those  pro-
grams,  that  I  recall,  that  he  was  in  favor  of,  were,  in  fact,  contin-
ued.

Chairman  MILLER.  Dr.  Clarke,  you  said  that  in  addition  to  the
lack  of  credibility  that  the  lab  had,  it  was  simply  a  cost  concern
and  I  certainly  applaud  every  agency  of  government  looking  for
ways to spend money and not feeling like they had to spend every-
thing  that  they  have  got,  but  this  a  lab  that  total  funding  was  $7
million. I think we heard $10 million, but $7 million to $10 million.
You  know,  again,  a  good  deal  less  than  that  contraption  I  saw  in
Hawaii that was hauled away to the Bering Sea.

Dr. CLARKE. Yes, sir.
Chairman MILLER. And according to the S&T Directorates, budg-
et information in fiscal year 2005 there was $505 million at the end
of  the  year  in  un-obligated  funds,  in  other  words  money  that  had
been appropriated, not spent. I applaud savings, frugality. In fiscal
2006,  $51  million  in  un-obligated  funds  or  money  that  is  appro-
priated  but  not  spent  and  right  now,  for  fiscal  year  2007,  for  $223
million in un-obligated funds or money that is appropriated but not
spent. Are those figures correct?

Dr. CLARKE. That is above my pay grade. I had fiduciary respon-

sibilities in one small area and that is what I was addressing.

Chairman  MILLER.  Okay.  Well,  I  have  no  further  questions,  but
I  encourage  frugality  in  all  of  the  Federal  Government,  but  I  am
sure  that  FEMA  saved  a  lot  of  money  in  the  time  leading  up  to
Katrina.  In  retrospect,  that  appears  to  be  penny  wise  and  pound
foolish.  And  the  money  that  the  S&T  Directorate  saved  on  EML,
I  fear  greatly,  is  going  to  appear  at  some  point  in  the  future  to  be
penny  wise  and  pound  foolish  if  we  are  not  ready  to  prevent  and
respond to a radiological attack. Thank you, Dr. Clarke.

And  we  will  take  a  five  minute  recess  so  everyone  can  stretch
and  refocus  and  attend  anything  else  that  needs  attending  to,  and
we will reconvene shortly.

[Recess]
Chairman MILLER. The Subcommittee has reconvened. The hear-
ing  is  in  order  again  and  I  will  now  call  our  third  panel,  Admiral
Jay  M.  Cohen,  the  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology,
Department  of  Homeland  Security;  and  Mr.  Vayl  Oxford,  Director
of Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, Department of Homeland Se-
curity.

And  you  all  have  been  here  for  the  other  panels,  so  I  am  sure
you know that you have five minutes to present all testimony. Your
written  testimony  has  already  been  placed  in  the  record  and  after
you  have  given  your  testimony,  each  Member  of  the  Committee,
which may be just me, will have five minutes to ask questions. Or
Mr. Rothman may be able to return.

And we do place everyone under oath. Do either of you have any
objection  to  taking  oaths,  being  sworn?  And  you  also  are  entitled
to counsel, if you want it. Do you have counsel or do you wish coun-
sel? And both of you are already raising your right hand.

Panel 3:

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  VAYL  S.  OXFORD,  DIRECTOR,  DOMESTIC
NUCLEAR  DETECTION  OFFICE,  DEPARTMENT  OF  HOME-
LAND SECURITY
Mr.  OXFORD.  Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Miller.  I  would  like  to
thank the Committee for the opportunity to discuss how DNDO has
worked with EML in the past and our plans for working with them
in  the  future.  I  am  pleased  to  appear  in  front  of  you  with  my  col-
league, Under Secretary Cohen.

EML  has  been  an  important  partner  for  us  and  support  us  in
three  core  areas;  the  Securing  the  Cities  Initiative  that  you  heard
about;  a  testing  series  underway  at  the  New  York  Container  Ter-
minal, as well as providing technical reach back within the North-
east  region.  They  also  perform  a  variety  of  other  technical  support
efforts  to  include  the  neutron  ship  effect  program  that  we  have
heard about this morning.

First  let  me  talk  about  Securing  the  Cities.  DNDO  established
the  Securing  the  Cities  initiative  to  equip  the  New  York  region
State  and  local  personnel  with  radiation  detection  capabilities  and
develop  a  defensive  architecture  for  the  protection  of  New  York
City.  EML  personnel,  using  their  experience  with  radiation  detec-
tion  systems  and  the  relationship  with  the  New  York  regional  law
enforcement  agencies,  are  supporting  these  federal  efforts.  They
provide  subject  matter  expertise  on  detection  system  performance
to the regional partners and participate in the development of con-
ceptive operations.

Second,  DNDO  is  currently  testing  its  next  generation  systems
called  Advanced  Spectroscopic  Portals  at  the  New  York  Container
Terminal. The results of the testing done at NYCT will help DNDO
determine  if  these  systems  are  ready  for  full  reproduction.  EML
provides the test director for this effort, oversees data quality man-
agement, and leads the multi-lab team to complete this test series.
Third,  to  support  the  deployment  of  detection  systems  into  the
field,  DNDO  provides  training,  response  protocols,  and  technical
reach  back  capabilities  to  assist  federal,  State,  and  local  law  en-
forcement  agencies  and  response  personnel  in  resolving  detector
alarms.  EML  provides  technical  support  to  the  deployments  we
have  throughout  the  Northeast.  Their  spectroscopic  expertise  is
available  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week  to  provide  technical
support for alarm resolution.

In  conclusion,  DNDO  sees  EML  as  an  important  partner  in  our
development,  test,  and  deployment  activities  and  projects.  There
will be an enduring need for EML into the foreseeable future.

Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you  for  your  attention.  I  will  be  glad  to

answer any questions you may have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VAYL S. OXFORD

Introduction

Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member  Sensenbrenner,  and  distin-
guished  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  I  am  Vayl  Oxford,  the  Director  of  the  Do-

mestic  Nuclear  Detection  Office  (DNDO),  and  I  would  like  to  thank  the  committee
for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  how  DNDO  has  worked  with  the  Environmental
Measurements Laboratory (EML) in the past, and our plans for working with them
in  the  future.  EML  is  a  federally  owned  and  operated  DHS  laboratory,  located  in
lower  Manhattan.  It  was  a  Department  of  Energy  research  facility  with  com-
petencies  in  low  level  radiation  detection  and  monitoring,  and  was  transferred  to
DHS S&T in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.

As Director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), my office is respon-
sible  for  developing  new  technologies,  as  well  as  ensuring  that  we  deploy  detection
systems properly across the domestic nuclear detection architecture. EML has been
an  important  partner  for  us,  particularly  because  they  provide  technical  support  in
the New York City metropolitan area, where there are three ongoing DNDO efforts.
Of the 25 technical staff present at EML, currently, nineteen support DNDO in var-
ious capacities at a level of effort equivalent to about 9.5 full time equivalents.

The three core areas where we receive support from EML are: Securing the Cities
(STC),  test  support  at  the  New  York  Container  Terminal  (NYCT),  and  technical
reach-back.  EML  provides  a  combination  of  regional  experience  with  radiological
and nuclear subject matter expertise. Specifically, EML personnel serve as the focal
point  in  New  York  for  regional  federal,  State  and  local  partners,  federal  technical
participants, and industry/facility operators. This has resulted in a strong and trust-
ed partnering among federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and the var-
ious  technical  Subject  Matter  Experts.  Through  EML,  we  have  developed  excellent
working  relationships  with  end  users  such  as  the  Port  Authorities  of  New  York  &
New Jersey; New York Police Department; Fire Department of New York; New Jer-
sey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, including the New Jersey State
Police; New York Office of Homeland Security, including the New York State Police;
New  York  City  Office  of  Emergency  Management;  and  local  Customs  and  Border
Protection, among others.

I  would  like  to  take  a  moment  to  go  into  more  detail  about  some  of  the  specific

DNDO programs that EML supports.
Securing the Cities

To  help  address  the  threat  of  a  radiological  or  nuclear  attack  against  urban  area
targets,  DNDO  established  the  STC  initiative  to  equip  State  and  local  personnel
with radiation detection technologies and develop a defense-in-depth architecture for
the  protection  of  the  New  York  City  area.  EML  personnel,  using  their  experience
with radiation detection systems and their established relationships with New York
City metropolitan area law enforcement agencies, are supporting the federal partici-
pation. They are also helping us integrate DNDO Regional Reach-back into STC ac-
tivities and procedures. Moreover, they are providing subject matter expertise on de-
tection  system  performance  and  capabilities  to  STC  regional  partners,  as  well  as
participating in the development of concept of operations.
Test Support at the New York Container Terminal

DNDO 

is  currently  testing 

its  next-generation  systems  called  Advanced
Spectroscopic  Portals  (ASP)  at  NYCT.  The  results  of  the  testing  at  NYCT  will  be
part of a larger data set that will help DNDO determine if our ASP systems provide
significant improvements in performance over current generation systems to support
the  Secretary’s  certification  decision,  as  required  by  the  DHS  FY  2007  Appropria-
tions  Act,  prior  to  a  full-rate  production  decision.  As  you  can  see,  this  is  an  impor-
tant  task,  and  EML  provides  the  Test  Director  for  this  effort  and  is  part  of  the
multi-lab  team  that  we  are  relying  on  to  get  this  task  completed.  Other  partici-
pating  labs  include  Sandia  National  Laboratories  (SNL)  and  Brookhaven  National
Laboratory (BNL).
Technical Reach-back

We often use a four-factor formula to define success at DNDO—successful encoun-
ter,  detection,  identification,  and  interdiction.  If  any  of  those  factors  are  unsuccess-
ful—for example, you mistakenly dismiss a threat—you are looking at the possibility
of  mission  failure.  Therefore,  in  support  of  the  deployment  of  detection  equipment
into  the  field,  DNDO  is  developing  and  implementing  a  technical  reach-back  capa-
bility  to  assist  federal,  State,  and  local  law  enforcement  and  response  personnel  in
understanding and resolving detector alarms.

EML,  along  with  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory,  provides  technical  support  to
the  deployments  we  have  in  the  Northeastern  region.  Regional  reach-back
spectroscopists—the people who can look at alarm data and determine the presence
or  absence  of  a  threat—are  available  twenty-four  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week.
They  work  with  DNDO’s  Joint  Analysis  Center  (JAC)  to  provide  technical  support
to federal, State and local personnel if a detection incident occurs that requires fur-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

ther  investigation  and  analysis.  The  laboratory  spectroscopists  evaluate  the  data
provided  through  the  JAC  in  order  to  determine  what  material(s)  have  been  de-
tected  by  the  equipment,  and  provide  other  technical  assistance  as  needed,  such  as
answering questions about equipment, commodity shipping, or radiation safety.
Other Efforts

In  addition  to  these  three  key  areas,  EML  has  played  a  technical  advisory  role
to  DNDO’s  Assessments  Directorate.  They  have  helped  us  with  test  planning  and
execution,  assisted  in  the  planning  and  execution  of  our  pilot  programs,  and  pro-
vided  quality  assurance  and  data  quality  management  for  our  test  and  evaluation
activities.  Also,  EML  is  participating  in  one  of  our  Transformational  Research  and
Development  projects  that  will  help  DNDO  determine  the  physical  limits  of  detect-
ing  nuclear  materials  and  devices  while  a  cargo  ship  is  in  transit.  This  type  of  re-
search  may  lead  to  detection  solutions  that  enable  us  to  push  out  our  borders  and
intercept threats well before they reach U.S. shores.
Conclusion

In conclusion, DNDO sees EML as an important partner in our research, develop-
ment,  and  test,  and  deployment  support  activities.  We  are  especially  aware  of  the
relationships  they  maintain  with  federal,  State  and  local  law  enforcement  and  first
responder personnel in the New York metropolitan region. Combined with their sub-
ject  matter  expertise  in  the  rad/nuc  field,  we  see  those  that  currently  support  the
DNDO mission at EML as valuable assets.

This  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member  Sen-
senbrenner, and Members of the Subcommittee, I thank you for your attention and
will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR VAYL S. OXFORD

STATEMENT OF ADMIRAL JAY M. COHEN, UNDER SECRETARY,
SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY  DIRECTORATE,  U.S.  DEPART-
MENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Admiral COHEN. Chairman Miller, it is a great honor, as always,
to  appear  before  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee  and  I
wanted to let you know personally how much I appreciate the pro-
fessionalism of the Committee staff in this matter.

Science  and  technology  has  and  will  change  the  world  and  it
holds the potential to make our nation safer. I grew up in the shad-
ow  of  the  EML  building  in  Lower  Manhattan  and  fully  appreciate
both its strategic location and its capabilities. I assumed my duties
as  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology,  Department  of
Homeland Security on the 10th of August. You may remember that
was  the  day  of  the  London  liquid  explosives  plot.  Immediately

thereafter,  on  the  11th  of  August,  I  established  a  rapid  response
team similar to what I had done in Navy and then after 9/11.

The  very  first  thing  we  did  was  to  convene  and  at  that  time  we
did  not  have  a  means  to  have  a  secure  video  teleconference,  so  we
just had a conference call with all of my organic labs, including the
Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  and  all  of  the  Depart-
ment of Energy laboratories, which the enabling legislation so wise-
ly  allowed  me  to  leverage.  I  challenged  them  with  their  diverse
backgrounds  and  talents,  especially  the  DOE  labs,  with  all  the
class  chemistry  and  physics  capabilities  to  help  us  solve  the  prob-
lems associated with liquid explosives on the aircraft.

Within two months those efforts allowed TSA to establish the 3–
1–1 rule, which is the three ounces in one bag per person, and get
our  aircraft  back  to  some  normalcy.  I  found  that,  in  August,  with
the  bipartisan  support  of  the  Congress  and  the  Administration,  I
immediately went about aligning my directorate for success as I be-
lieve  the  enabling  legislation  wisely  envisioned.  I  established  what
I  call  the  Four  Gets.  I  had  to  get  the  organization  right;  I  had  to
get the people right; I had to get the books right; and I had to get
the content right. And along with these I established what I believe
to  be  the  principle  threats  or  as  I  call  it,  the  Four  Bs;  bombs,  bor-
der,  bugs  and  business  where  business  represents  the  underlying
cyber that enables our whole society and our economy.

The organization was approved the first week of September 2006.
The  president’s  fiscal  year  2008  budget  was  realigned  to  the  new
six  division  customer  outward  focused  model  that  I  put  in  place.
And in October, the Congress, in a bipartisan way, asked me to re-
align the fiscal year 2007 Department of Homeland Security appro-
priations  law  to  the  new  model.  The  status  of  my  directorate  at
that  time  was  clearly  documented  in  fiscal  year  2007  legislation.
The  Transportation  Security  Lab’s  assignment  to  the  Department
of  Homeland  Security  S&T  versus  TSA  was  in  doubt.  The  univer-
sities’  Centers  of  Excellence  were  at  risk,  moral  was  low  and  good
people were leaving my directorate.

Congress was on the verge of cutting my fiscal year 2007 budget
by  $200  million.  As  I  previously  testified,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  took
great  courage  on  both  sides  of  the  aisle  in  an  election  year  to  re-
store  those  monies,  as  you  did  so  late  in  the  year  and  I  am  very
appreciative of that. Over the last eight months, we have, with the
help of Congress, largely achieved the Four Gets. Included in that,
government service scientists and engineers who had left my direc-
torate  last  spring,  last  fall  asked  to  come  back  and  we  welcomed
them with open arms and they are now part of my team.

The  final  piece  of  that  effort  was  bringing  the  full  integration  of
both  my  organic  DHS  labs  with  national  Department  of  Energy
labs, as well as university Centers of Excellence, to provide the two
pillars of basic research so important to our national safety. I have
some  charts,  should  you  ask  questions,  that  will  allude  to  how  we
have done that.

Finally, Vayl Oxford and I are military and naval academy grad-
uates who understand the meaning of leadership responsibility and
accountability.  For  all  my  DHS  S&T  mandated  missions,  the  buck
stops  with  me.  People  are  the  most  valuable  asset.  The  Nation  is
in  crisis  in  science  and  technology.  No  one  knows  that  better  than

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

the Science and Technology Committee and I salute your efforts in
the  stand  and  so  many  other  initiative  areas  and  we  want  to  be
part of that.

I  regularly  meet  with  and  listen  to  all  of  my  people.  I  have
worked to make amends to them for any perception that they were
not  fully  valued  and  appreciated  at  the  Department  of  Homeland
Security. I can assure you they are. Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee,  we  can  and  will  do  better  for  the  Nation.  I  welcome
your oversight and your questions and I will look forward to work-
ing with your Committee and your staff. Thank you, sir.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAY M. COHEN

Good  Morning  Chairman  Miller,  Ranking  Member  Sensenbrenner,  and  distin-
guished  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  It  is  an  honor  to  appear  before  you  today
to update you on the Department’s plans for the Environmental Measurements Lab-
oratory (EML).

The  Science  and  Technology  (S&T)  Directorate  is  committed  to  serving  our  cus-
tomers,  the  components  that  comprise  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security
(DHS)—and  their  customers—the  hardworking  men  and  women  on  the  front  lines
of homeland security, especially the first responders, who need ready access to tech-
nology  and  information  to  perform  their  jobs  more  efficiently  and  safely.  I  am  hon-
ored and privileged to serve with the talented scientists, engineers and other profes-
sionals who support these dedicated Americans in our shared mission to secure our
homeland  and  defend  our  freedoms.  Many  of  those  talented  people  work  at  our  or-
ganic  DHS  laboratories,  the  Transportation  Security  Lab,  Plum  Island  Animal  Dis-
ease Center, and EML.

EML is a federally owned and operated DHS laboratory, located in lower Manhat-
tan. It was a Department of Energy research facility with competencies in low level
radiation detection and monitoring, and was transferred to DHS S&T in the Home-
land Security Act of 2002. EML has currently 35 federal employees. Twenty-five are
technical  with  backgrounds  in  radiation  health  physics,  dosimetry,  atmospheric
transport, radio-chemistry, and nuclear spectroscopy. There are also ten administra-
tive  support  employed  at  EML.  Since  coming  to  DHS,  EML  staff  has  provided  sup-
port to the S&T Directorate and, since its inception in April 2005, the Domestic Nu-
clear Detection Office (DNDO).

DNDO  was  established  pursuant  to  Homeland  Security  Presidential  Directive  14
and  Section  872  of  the  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002  (P.L.  107–296).  Section  501
of the Security and Accountability For Every (SAFE) Port Act of 2006 (P.L. 109–347)
statutorily established DNDO, and amended the Homeland Security Act of 2002 re-
moving  all  radiological  or  nuclear  responsibilities  and  authorities  from  the  Under
Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology.  Although  the  laboratory  is  managed  within
the  S&T  Directorate,  EML  has  applied  its  staff’s  radiation  detection  expertise  and
operational  testing  experience  primarily  to  support  DNDO  programs.  Currently,
nineteen  EML  staff  members  support  DNDO  at  level  of  effort  equivalent  to  about
9.5  full-time  employees.  DNDO  director  Vayl  Oxford  and  I  have  discussed  DNDO’s
requirements  and  have  agreed  that  this  is  approximately  the  long-term  workload
that EML can expect in support of DNDO programs.

EML  staff  has  also  been  involved  with  radiation  and  explosives  detection  Test  &
Evaluation  (T&E)  involving  a  number  of  federal,  State,  and  local  end-users;  and
with standards development, including program management and working group ac-
tivities.  As  the  Homeland  Security  Act  of  2002  also  assigned  me  the  responsibility
of  coordinating  all  T&E  activities  of  the  Department,  together  with  my  DHS  S&T
Directorate  T&E  Director  and  EML  leadership,  I  am  personally  and  actively  work-
ing  to  identify  an  appropriate  T&E  role  for  the  remainder  of  the  EML  workforce.
The President’s Budget Request for FY 2008 reflects my expectation that DNDO will
continue to require the current level of support from EML, and that we will be able
to  productively  utilize  the  remainder  of  the  workforce  in  a  meaningful  DHS  T&E
role.
EML  currently  leases  ∼96,000  sq.  ft.  in  the  GSA  building  at  201  Varick  Street
New  York,  NY.  The  leased  space  includes  basement  storage,  a  four  bay  garage  and
loading  dock,  and  a  rooftop  platform.  The  current  lease  expires  at  the  end  of  FY
2008  and  the  rent  is  expected  to  increase  in  2009.  I  will  work  to  ‘‘right  size’’  both
leased  floor  space  at  the  current  EML  location  and  a  sustainable  technical  and  ad-

ministrative  workforce  that  will  ensure  EML’s  new  role  in  supporting  both  DHS
S&T  and  DNDO  in  making  the  Nation  safer.  EML  will  be  fully  integrated  into  my
organic and DOE laboratory governance model designed to align my supporting lab-
oratories to the current DHS S&T Directorate organization, similar to the alignment
being  accomplished  with  DHS  S&T  university  Centers  of  Excellence.  I  greatly  re-
spect  the  invaluable  contribution  that  the  intellectual  capital  our  S&T  workforce  of
scientists, engineers and associates at EML (and all other S&T activities supporting
DHS  missions)  make  through  discoveries  and  inventions  to  equip  our  DHS  compo-
nents  and  First  Responders  with  cutting  edge  technology  to  protect  America  well
into the future.

I  appreciate  the  many  demands  on  the  taxpayers’  precious  dollars.  You  have  my
commitment  that  the  S&T  Directorate  will  be  wise  stewards  of  the  public  monies
you have provided to serve the best interests of the Nation by investing in the talent
and  technology  that  will  provide  America  with  a  sustainable  capability  to  protect
against acts of terror and other high-consequence events.

Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  you
today to discuss this important matter. I welcome your interest and oversight. I look

BIOGRAPHY FOR JAY M. COHEN

Department  of  Homeland  Security,  Under  Secretary  for  Science  and  Technology,
Jay M. Cohen is a native of New York. He was commissioned in 1968 as an Ensign
upon  graduation  from  the  United  States  Naval  Academy.  He  holds  a  joint  Ocean
Engineering  degree  from  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  and  Woods  Hole
Oceanographic  Institution  and  Master  of  Science  in  Marine  Engineering  and  Naval
Architecture from MIT.

His  early  Navy  assignments  included  service  on  conventional  and  nuclear  sub-
marines. From 1985 to 1988 Cohen commanded USS HYMAN G. RICKOVER (SSN
709).

Following  command,  he  served  on  the  U.S.  Atlantic  Fleet  as  a  senior  member  of
the  Nuclear  Propulsion  Examining  Board,  responsible  for  certifying  the  safe  oper-
ation of nuclear powered ships and crews.

From 1991 to 1993, he commanded USS L.Y. SPEAR (AS 36) including a deploy-

ment to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation DESERT STORM.

After  Spear,  he  reported  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy  as  Deputy  Chief  of  Navy
Legislative  Affairs.  During  this  assignment,  Cohen  was  responsible  for  supervising
all Navy-Congressional liaisons.

Cohen  was  promoted  to  the  rank  of  Rear  Admiral  in  October  1997  and  reported
to the Joint Staff as Deputy Director for Operations responsible to the President and
DOD leaders for strategic weapons release authority.

In June 1999, he assumed duties as Director Navy Y2K Project Office responsible

for transitioning all Navy computer systems into the new century.

In  June  2000,  Cohen  was  promoted  in  rank  and  became  the  20th  Chief  of  Naval
Research.  He  served  during  war  as  the  Department  of  the  Navy  Chief  Technology
Officer (a direct report to the Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations and
Commandant  of  the  Marine  Corps).  Responsible  for  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Science  and  Technology  (S&T)  Program  (involving  basic  research  to  applied  tech-
nology  portfolios  and  contracting),  Cohen  coordinated  investments  with  other  U.S.
and  international  S&T  providers  to  rapidly  meet  war  fighter  combat  needs.  After
an unprecedented five and a half year assignment as Chief of Naval Research, Rear
Admiral Cohen retired on February 1, 2006.

Under  Secretary  Cohen  was  sworn  in  to  his  current  position  at  the  Department

of Homeland Security on August 10, 2006.

DISCUSSION

DHS’ ASSESSMENT OF EML

Chairman  MILLER.  Thank  you,  Admiral  Cohen.  I  do  have  a  few
questions for each of you. Mr. Oxford, in your testimony this morn-
ing,  mixed  testimony.  It  was  skills,  the  strengths,  the  capabilities
of  the  Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  and  obviously
there  were  some  people,  at  least  within  the  S&T  Directorate,  who

did  not  believe  that  the  lab  had  any  unique  skills,  it  did  not  have
any  qualities,  that  its  programs  could  be  easily  replicated  in  other
labs  and  then  others  on  the  first  panel  this  morning  who  took,  in
my  hearing,  a  very  different  point  of  view.  What  is  your  own  as-
sessment of the Environmental Measurements Laboratory?

Mr.  OXFORD.  We  have,  Mr.  Chairman,  found  them  to  be  very
adaptable  and  responsive  to  the  changing  landscape.  When  I  was
first standing up DNDO, the view in S&T at the time was that the
Countermeasures  Test  Bed  would  draw  upon  them  to  continue  the
efforts.  We  actually  contemplated  moving  the  Countermeasures
Test  Bed  to  DNDO  because  it  had  been  predominately  a  rad  nuke
related  activity  with  EML  providing  some  of  the  support,  but  the
vision  of  S&T  at  the  time  was  to  broaden  that  into  explosives  and
chemical  support  work  within  that  region  so  we  chose  to  leave
Countermeasures Test Bed within S&T and just leverage that.

As  we  revisited  the  needs  within  DNDO,  we  realized  we  needed
strong  State  and  local  partnerships  and  regional  partnerships  and
with  the  emergence  of  things  like  the  test  series,  the  Securing  the
Cities  initiatives  I  talked  about,  we  recognized  the  presence  of
EML  and  the  support  they  had  already  provided  in  the  past  was
a  very  valuable  activity.  I  had  heard  some  rumblings  that  there
were  studies  underway  within  S&T  to  maybe  change  that  land-
scape. I cautioned against that. I even had a short discussion with
the Secretary, suggesting that this needed to be fully vetted before
any action was taken.

I later found that there was a briefing and it was in preparation,
I  think  you  heard  reference  to  it  this  morning,  to  make  a  rec-
ommendation  from  the  Under  Secretary  at  the  time  to  go  to  the
Secretary  to  possibly  make  a  recommendation  to  close  the  lab.
Within that briefing, when I got a copy of it, it said that there had
been  no  near-term  requirements  identified  for  the  laboratory  and
specifically  cited  DNDO  as  one  of  those  entities  that  had  no  near-
term  requirements.  I  had  not  been  personally  consulted  at  the
time, so that was when I wrote the letter to the acting Under Sec-
retary  at  the  time,  outlining  what  we  thought  our  specific  needs
were,  which  equated  at  the  time  between  nine  and  twelve  people
to  provide  the  support  to  the  three  programs  I  mentioned  in  my
opening  statement.  So  we  have  found  them  to  be  more  than  com-
petent in the changing landscape that we confront right now in the
New York region.

Chairman  MILLER.  And  I  know  it  sounds  redundant,  but  they
had skills, they expertise that was important to your office, impor-
tant to what you were doing?

Mr. OXFORD. Absolutely. I am a big believer in bringing together
the combination of technologists and operators, and by having peo-
ple that have the trust of the New York City officials, as you heard
from  Assistant  Commissioner  Duecker  this  morning,  the  bridge
that  the  technical  expertise—there  are  vendors  in  this  world,  as
you  probably  know,  with  the  committee  oversight  that  you  have,
that  will  sell  almost  anything  to  anybody  and  the  operators  are
particularly  prone  to  that  kind  of  marketing.  EML  helps  provide
the  bridge  between  my  office  and  the  New  York  City  officials  who
are deluged with these kind of marketing schemes to provide tech-
nical  assistance  on  a  daily  basis  to  make  sure  that  as  we  develop

75

systems  and  they  acquire  systems,  they  get  the  right  equipment,
so it was very valuable.

Chairman MILLER. Okay. And we have heard different testimony
about  how  EML  was  regarded  by  first  responders.  I  understand
that your office works closely with the first responders, the first re-
sponder community, particularly in New York. Do you know, based
on  your  own  dealings  with  the  first  responder  community,  how
EML is viewed by New York’s first responders?

Mr.  OXFORD.  As  you  say,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  work  very  closely
with the State and local community up there. I have developed per-
sonal  relationships  through  the  Securing  the  Cities  relationship
with  the  Port  Authority  of  New  York  and  New  Jersey,  the  Office
of  Emergency  Management,  the  fire  department,  as  well  as  re-
gional  partners  in  New  York  State  and  New  Jersey  State,  as  well
as  Connecticut.  This  is  all  under  the  umbrella  of  the  Securing  the
Cities and the police commissioner.

However, I can tell you that they call upon EML on a daily basis
to  provide  the  technical  consultation  that  I  have  talked  about,  not
only  in  the  development  of  systems,  but  also  in  looking  at  a  re-
gional  deployment  architecture  where  detection  systems  may  be
the most efficient and effective, as well as to provide this technical
support; if they ever do get alarms, how fast can we respond?

Chairman MILLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Oxford, and I hope
that, under your leadership, we can make EML an asset to our na-
tional security and our homeland security.

Admiral  Cohen,  thank  you  also  for  being  here  and  I  know  that
we talked this morning about what has happened in the past with
respect to EML and the problems and I certainly hope that you can
get  things  on  track.  You  apparently  share  the  view  that  things
have  gone  off  track  with  respect  to  EML  and  that  EML  is  a  value
to  the  Nation’s  security  and  homeland  security.  Am  I  correct  in
taking  your  testimony  today  as  a  pledge  to  make  the  EML  an
asset, a contributor to our response to the threats that we face?

Admiral  COHEN.  Absolutely,  Mr.  Chairman.  If  I  may  just  follow
up  a  little  bit  on  Mr.  Oxford’s  testimony  of  the  value  of  EML  to
New  York  and  also  to  homeland  security  and  the  first  responders
in  the  tri-state  area,  when  I  was  Chief  of  Naval  Research,  about
a  month  after  the  tragic  events  of  9/11,  I  was  asked  by  the  Police
Commissioner of New York to come up to his office, look at Ground
Zero,  which  of  course,  we  did,  and  as  Mr.  Oxford  has  indicated,  so
many  people  offered  so  many  solutions;  Radiacs,  and  we  saw  this
after  10  August  where  I  was  inundated  with  handheld  devices  for
liquid explosives.

In the enabling legislation here at DHS, not only am I the execu-
tive  for  Science  and  Technology  for  the  Department,  but  you  have
given me two department-wide responsibilities in addition, which I
value very much. One is the Test and Evaluation Executive setting
the  policy  throughout  the  Department  and  the  other  is  for  stand-
ards,  working  alongside  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and
Technology.  This  is  an  area  that  was  not  widely  exercised  before
my arrival as part of the realignment that we talked about and we
have that all in writing in what I call the STORM, the Science and
Technology  Regulations  Manual,  so  everyone  knows  what  their  re-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

sponsibilities are, what the chain of command is, that for the liquid
explosives, we asked people to come in.

76

We  sent  them  to  Sequoia,  New  Mexico  shortly  after  10  August.
We  actually  did  standardized  testing  and  no  surprise,  I  think  Mr.
Oxford  would  agree  with  these  statistics.  We  found  about  half
didn’t  work  even  though  they  looked  very  good  on  CNN.  And  the
other  half,  some  variation  of  those  were  easily  spoofed,  putting  a
liquid  dye  in  a  clear  liquid.  When  the  liquid  was  clear,  they  could
determine what it was, but once you put a dye in it, they couldn’t.
And so about a month after 9/11, I was invited, as Chief Naval Re-
search,  in  a  naval  research  laboratory  right  here  on  the  Potomac
reported to me at that time to go to New York.

The police commissioner takes me into a room, table about twice
this size, and it is just full of handheld Radiac, these are radiation
detection  devices.  And  he  said  Admiral,  he  said  we—and  Mr.
Chairman, you have to remember at this point, the anthrax attacks
are continuing. You don’t know when the next shoe is going to fall.
And  so  he  says  we  want  to  equip  all  of  our  squad  cars  with  a  Ra-
diac  and  he  said  we  don’t  know  what  to  buy.  Admiral,  would  you
help me? And I said absolutely. I said if you will just have a quali-
fied  patrolman,  whoever  you  want,  bring  these  to  the  Potomac
Naval Research Lab. I will test them compared to what the manu-
facturer  says  they  are  going  to  do  and  I  will  let  you  know.  I  will
not, however, make recommendation.

We  did  that  for  the  New  York  City  Police  Department,  so  it  is
no surprise to me, when I came into this new job, not having prior
knowledge of EML, to know that we had a group there where when
you looked at the concentration of people, the efforts that DHS and
other  activities  government  agencies  are  making,  the  high  prob-
ability of the threat to the tri-state area, that this was a jewel that
we  needed  to  maintain,  but  as  been  testified  to  earlier,  we  needed
to  work  with  EML  so  that  they  could  support  both  DNDO  and  its
very  important  areas  which  I  no  longer,  based  on  the  fiscal  year
2007  legislation,  have  responsibility  for  nuclear  radiological.  All
those  reside  with  DNDO.  And  in  my  area,  especially  if  test  and
evaluation  for  many  of  the  different  sensors  that  we  are  bringing
to  bear,  as  Mr.  Oxford  indicated,  we  want  to  expand  that  not  just
from  nuclear,  but  to  include  chem,  bio  and  explosives,  which  are
my  responsibility.  So  I  am  committed  to  it,  sir,  but  it  does  take
time to change the culture of a land.

Chairman  MILLER.  Admiral  Cohen,  unless  you  just  especially
want to show us your charts, I am happy to excuse the two of you
now.

Admiral COHEN. Thank you, sir.
Mr. OXFORD. Thank you.
Chairman  MILLER.  I  want  to  thank  all  the  witnesses.  I  have  to
say  I  am  disappointed  in  the  way  the  EML  has  been  regarded  in
the last few years. I am glad that I am able to express disappoint-
ment rather than outrage, as we piece together, months after a ra-
diological attack, what might have been done different. And I hope
that the errors that we have made at this point we can correct and
I appreciate the commitment by Mr. Oxford and Admiral Cohen to
correct those errors. My able staff, the able staff of our committee,
when  they  heard  me  talking  about  the  contraption  that  I  saw  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 21:06 Jan 25, 2008 Jkt 034908 PO 00000 Frm 00080 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\I&O07\050307\34908 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

77

Hawaii,  through  the  wonders  of  the  Internet  were  able  to  find  out
what the contraption was. And it is massive. Admiral, I don’t have
a chart for you.

It is a heavy lift vessel, the Blue Marlin, and on a deck and that
is  where  I  saw  it.  I  saw  it  on  the  Blue  Marlin.  The  Sea-based  X-
band  radar,  as  it  completed  the  photograph,  as  it  completed  the
1600 mile journey from Corpus Christi, Texas and then it would go
on from there to the Bering Sea. According to Wikipedia and so we
assume  that  no  one  had  gone  on  Wikipedia  and  changed  the  num-
bers.  At  that  point,  this  one  contraption  had  cost  $900  million.
That  does  not  count  the  annual  operating  cost.  That  is  the  radar
to support a missile defense system that we have never made work.
It  seems  to  me  that  it  is  very  unlikely  that  our  nation  will  be
struck by a nuclear weapon fired from a missile from the soil of an-
other country.

It is not unlikely because we will intercept it out of the air, that
we will hit that bullet with a bullet. It is unlikely because the Na-
tion  that  fired  the  missile  would  cease  to  exist  because  of  retalia-
tion. They say that if you owe a bank $20,000 you have got a prob-
lem;  if  you  owe  a  bank  $200  million,  the  bank  has  got  a  problem.
It appears that if your program is $7 million a year and not many
people have heard of it, it pretty much doesn’t matter what it does,
what  its  value  is,  that  program  is  at  risk.  If  you  spend  $7  billion
on  a  program,  almost  despite  the  evidence  that  that  program  is
never going to do anything, it never goes away.

I  hope  that  we  do  go  forward  and  recognize  that  this  lab,  al-
though small, although before this hearing it may be even with this
hearing,  obscure,  does  play  an  important  role  in  our  ability  to  re-
spond  to  the  most  likely  threats  we  face.  To  prepare  for,  we  hope,
we  pray  to  prevent  and  then  to  respond  to  the  most  likely  threats
that  we  face;  a  dirty  bomb;  God  forbid,  a  nuclear  device,  not  fired
from  the  soil  of  another  country,  but  in  a  freighter,  smuggled  into
the  United  States  in  a  truck.  And  that  the  neglect  that  we  have
shown to this lab in the next three years will not be something that
we  review  again,  wondering  what  if,  whether  these  three  years  or
four  years  of  neglect  would  not  have  led  to  a  different  result.  But
thank  all  of  you  for  being  here  and  thank  you  for  your  testimony
today.

Admiral COHEN. Mr. Chairman, if I just may, what you see here
is  a  picture  of  a  meeting  that  we  had.  I  believe  it  is  the  first  ever
meeting  on  the  1st  of  May,  just  two  days  ago.  These  are  all  of  the
lab directors, principals only of all the DOE labs, as well as my or-
ganic  labs.  You  can  see  Adam  Hunter.  He  is  standing  just  to  the
left  of  the  fellow  in  the  light  shirt.  Adam  is  the  Acting  Director  of
EML. He, Transportation Security Lab, my End Back and my Plum
Island labs were sitting at the table. Thirty-five people, 35,000 peo-
ple.  They  had  the  same  vote  and  we  are  now  aligned  as  we  have
aligned the Centers of Excellence and we appreciate so much North
Carolina’s  contribution  to  that,  so  that  we  are  supporting,  in  the
basic  research  area,  those  critical  initiatives  to  make  the  Nation
safer. So this meeting was scheduled long before we had knowledge
of  this  hearing.  It  is  the  last  piece  of  the  puzzle,  in  my  alignment,
and now it is up to me, working with Vayl, to make it a reality and
we look forward to working with you, sir.
