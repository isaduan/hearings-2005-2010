Federal STEM Education Programs:

Educators’ Perspectives

TUESDAY, MAY 15, 2007
10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

The  purpose  of  this  hearing  is  to  inform  the  Subcommittee  of  educators’  experi-
ences  working  with  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  (STEM)  education
programs  for  K–16  students  supported  by  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies:  Na-
tional  Aeronautics  &  Space  Administration  (NASA),  National  Oceanographic  &  At-
mospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  National  Institute  of  Standards  &  Technology
(NIST), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Energy (DOE).
This  hearing  will  explore  whether  such  issues  as  the  lack  of  coordination  between
the agencies, difficulty by educators in finding information about the programs, and
the  absence  of  robust  evaluation  techniques  hinder  the  potential  of  the  federal  pro-
grams  for  improving  STEM  education  in  America.  Most  importantly,  the  hearing
will  highlight  how  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  can  best  contribute  to  raising
the level of scientific literacy of all students.
Witnesses
Ms. Linda K. Froschauer, President, National Science Teachers Association
Mr. Michael C. Lach, Director of Mathematics and Science, Chicago Public Schools

Dr. Iris R. Weiss, President, Horizon Research, Inc.

Overarching Questions

• What are the experiences of educators in finding and leveraging resources for
STEM  education  from  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies?  What  challenges
have they encountered?
• What do educators perceive to be successful STEM education programs at the
federal R&D mission agencies? How do they determine success? What should
the agencies improve?
• What  support  that  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  could  provide  would

have the most impact on improving STEM education?

Background

A multitude of studies over the past twenty years have documented the downward
slide of American students’ proficiency and participation in science, technology, engi-
neering  and  mathematics  (STEM)  fields.  In  October  2005,  the  National  Academies
released  the  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm:  Energizing  and  Employing
America for a Brighter Economic Future, which warned that ‘‘the scientific and tech-
nological  building  blocks  critical  to  our  economic  leadership  are  eroding  at  a  time
when many other nations are gathering strength.’’ The authoring committee deemed
the highest priority action to be vast improvement of science and mathematics edu-
cation  in  order  to  increase  the  number  of  students  interested  in  and  prepared  for
entering careers in STEM fields.

The  scientific  and  technical  expertise  of  the  R&D  mission  agencies  has  been  ap-
plied  to  varying  degrees  and  with  varying  success  to  programs  and  activities  rel-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:21 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

evant  to  improving  STEM  education.  Currently,  the  STEM  education  programs  at
these agencies for K–16 grades are relatively small and vary widely in methods, tar-
get  audiences,  evaluation  measurements,  and  funding.  In  an  inventory  of  STEM
education  programs,  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  (ACC)  identified  ap-
proximately  $39  million  in  FY06  appropriated  funds  at  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies for K–12 programs and $6.6 million for undergraduate programs.

Until  recently,  the  agencies  have  developed  their  programs  independently  and
without a strategic plan for accomplishing a set of overarching goals and objectives.
Unfortunately, this led to a need for each program to discover a cadre of ‘‘best prac-
tices’’  on  its  own  rather  than  collaborating  with  other  program  and  agency  experts.
Each  program  also  developed  a  unique  method  of  evaluation,  making  a  comparison
of effectiveness across the programs impossible. Lastly, the agencies have had trou-
ble building widespread awareness of their programs among teachers nationwide.

In  response  to  these  issues,  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council,  which
serves as the principal body for coordinating federal research and development, has
re-established  the  Education  and  Workforce  Development  subcommittee  to  encour-
age  the  agencies  to  share  knowledge  and  develop  a  federal  strategic  plan  for  effec-
tively  increasing  STEM  proficiency  nationwide.  The  plans  for  this  new  federal  co-
ordination  and  planning  activity  will  be  reviewed  by  the  Subcommittee  in  a  subse-
quent hearing.

The Subcommittee recognizes that critical guidance for how to improve the federal
STEM  education  programs  must  come  from  the  people  who  work  directly  with
teachers  and  students.  The  witnesses  for  today’s  hearing  were  chosen  because  of
their  experience  working  with  these  programs  and  have  been  asked  to  provide  in-
sight  from  the  field  on  what  the  agencies  are  doing  well  and  where  they  need  to
improve.
Specific Questions for the Witnesses
Ms. Linda K. Froschauer

• In your experience, what are the federal R&D mission agencies doing well in
their  respective  STEM  education  programs?  What  could  they  do  better?  Can
you give examples of any particularly effective programs?

• How  do  your  teacher  members  learn  about  STEM  education  programs  spon-

sored by the federal research and development agencies?

Dr. George D. Nelson

• In  what  ways  can  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  contribute  most  effectively
to improve K–12 STEM education? Can you give examples of any particularly
effective programs?

• At the undergraduate level, what type of support could the federal R&D mis-
sion agencies provide that would recruit more students into pursuing careers
in the physical sciences?

• How  does  the  lack  of  coordination  and  overarching  strategy  for  STEM  edu-

cation programs hinder the agencies from making an impact?

Chairman  BAIRD.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order.  I  want  to
thank the witnesses and our guests and thank my good friend and
colleague, Dr. Ehlers, Ranking Member.

Our  Subcommittee  on  Research  and  Science  Education  Com-
mittee  is  interested  in  hearing  from  educators  in  science,  tech-
nology, engineering and mathematics, STEM fields, about their ex-
periences working with the federal R&D mission agencies.

This  hearing  is  part  of  the  ongoing  effort  led  by  Chairman  Gor-
don  that  the  Committee  is  undertaking  to  determine  how  to  im-
prove the level of scientific understanding of students in the United
States  and  how  to  attract  more  students  to  careers  in  science  and
engineering.

There  have  been  at  least  a  half-dozen  reports  released  over  the
past  20  years  documenting  how  American  students  have  fallen  be-
hind  students  in  other  countries.  The  National  Academies  report,
Rising Above the Gathering Storm, warned us that this will threat-
en  the  standing  of  our  country  in  the  future.  The  authors  of  that
paper wrote ‘‘the scientific and technological building blocks critical
to our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other
nations are gathering strength.’’ They recommended, they being the
authors,  recommended  that  the  highest  priority  should  be  a  vast
improvement of science and mathematics education in this country
in  order  to  increase  the  number  of  students  interested  in  and  pre-
pared to enter careers in STEM fields.

The Science and Technology Committee held a hearing in March
with leading voices in private industry and higher education to dis-
cuss  research  and  education  needs  in  STEM  fields.  Every  one  of
the  witnesses,  including  a  retired  CEO  of  Lockheed  Martin,  the
current  CEO  of  McGraw-Hill,  the  CEO  of  Intel,  and  the  President
of  the  Council  on  Competitiveness,  testified  that  companies  in
America  need  a  workforce  well-trained  in  STEM  fields  in  order  to
continue the innovative solutions that keep them profitable.

The  Committee  has  taken  this  advice  to  heart.  H.R.  362,  also
known  as  ‘‘10,000  Teachers,  10  Million  Minds’’  Science  and  Math
Scholarship  Act,  was  introduced  by  Chairman  Gordon  earlier  this
year. The bill implements most of the K–12 education recommenda-
tions  of  the  Gathering  Storm  report  and  was  passed  by  the  House
with strong bipartisan support last month.

The  Research  and  Science  Education  Subcommittee  will  next  be
exploring  ways  that  federal  efforts  in  STEM  education  can  be  bet-
ter focused and more effective. This is the first in a planned series
of hearings to address these issues.

Today  we  are  reviewing  the  role  of  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies  in  improving  STEM  education.  Specifically,  we  are  refer-
ring  to  NASA,  NOAA,  NIST,  EPA,  and  the  Department  of  Energy.
I believe there is a great deal of untapped potential residing in the
expertise of scientists and engineers at these agencies.

Not  only  do  these  scientists  and  engineers  possess  impressive
content knowledge of the sciences, they also have real-world experi-
ence  with  the  ‘‘wow’’  factor  that  gets  kids  excited  about  learning
science.  Space  travel,  discovering  new  forms  of  ocean  life,  creating
renewable energy sources, improving air and water quality, testing
bullet-proof  vests,  we  could  list  hundreds  of  more  activities  that
make science and math captivating to young people.

Although  the  agencies  have  made  commendable  efforts  to  share
their  knowledge  and  passion  for  science  with  students,  I  believe
those  efforts  have  been  relatively  small  and  have  varied  widely  in
their  methods,  target  audiences,  and  methods  of  evaluation.  The
programs  have  been  developed  independently  and  without  a  stra-
tegic  plan  for  accomplishing  a  common  set  of  goals  and  objectives.
With  a  unified  effort,  I  am  convinced  these  programs  could  have  a
much bigger impact on the approximately 52 million K–12 students
in America.

So we have asked our witnesses today to tell us about their expe-
riences participating in these programs. We have asked them to re-
spond to a series of questions. What do the agencies do well? What
should  they  improve?  Which  programs  do  educators  consider  suc-
cessful? And how do they define that success?

The Committee is devoted to improving science education, so de-
voted  that  we  added  science  education  to  the  name  of  this  sub-
committee.  We  are  very  concerned  that  American  students  are  not
achieving their potential in science and math education. It is a con-
cern not only as we look at competing in a knowledge-based global
economy  but  also  when  we  look  at  access  to  high-paying,  tech-
nology-based jobs in this country.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  today’s  witnesses  and  recognize

my colleague and Ranking Member, Dr. Ehlers.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BRIAN BAIRD

Good morning and thank you for attending today’s Subcommittee on Research and
Science  Education  hearing.  Today,  we  are  going  to  hear  from  educators  in  science,
technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics—STEM  fields—about  their  experiences
working with the federal R&D mission agencies.

This  hearing  is  part  of  an  ongoing  effort  that  the  Committee  is  undertaking  to
determine  how  to  improve  the  level  of  scientific  understanding  of  students  in  the
U.S. and how to attract more students to careers in science and engineering.

There have been at least a half dozen reports released over the past 20 years doc-
umenting  how  American  students  have  fallen  behind  students  in  other  countries.
The  National  Academies  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  warned  us  that
this will threaten the standing of our country in the future. The authors wrote ‘‘the
scientific  and  technological  building  blocks  critical  to  our  economic  leadership  are
eroding  at  a  time  when  many  other  nations  are  gathering  strength.’’  They  rec-
ommended  that  the  highest  priority  should  be  a  vast  improvement  of  science  and
mathematics  education  in  this  country  in  order  to  increase  the  number  of  students
interested in and prepared to enter careers in STEM fields.

The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  held  a  hearing  in  March  with  leading
voices  in  private  industry  and  higher  education  to  discuss  research  and  education
needs in STEM fields. Every one of the witnesses, including a retired CEO of Lock-
heed Martin, the current CEO of McGraw-Hill, the CEO of Intel, and the President
of the Council on Competitiveness, testified that companies in America need a work-
force well-trained in STEM fields in order to continue the innovative solutions that
keep them profitable.

The Committee has taken this advice to heart. H.R. 362, ‘‘10,000 Teachers, 10 Mil-
lions  Minds’’  Science  and  Math  Scholarship  Act,  was  introduced  by  Chairman  Gor-
don  early  this  year.  The  bill  implements  most  of  the  K–12  education  recommenda-
tions of the Gathering Storm report and was passed by the House last month.

The  Research  and  Science  Education  Subcommittee  will  next  be  exploring  ways
that  federal  efforts  in  STEM  education  can  be  better  focused  and  more  effective.
This is the first in a planned series of hearings to address these issues.

Today we are reviewing the role of the federal R&D mission agencies in improving
STEM education. Specifically, I am referring to NASA, NOAA, NIST, EPA, and the
Department of Energy. I believe there is a great deal of untapped potential residing
in the expertise of scientists and engineers at these agencies.

Not  only  do  these  scientists  and  engineers  possess  impressive  content  knowledge
in  the  sciences,  they  also  have  real-world  experience  with  the  ‘‘wow’’  factors  that
gets  kids  excited  about  learning  science.  Space  travel,  discovering  new  forms  of
ocean life, creating renewable energy sources, improving air and water quality, test-
ing  bullet-proof  vests—I  could  list  hundreds  more  activities  that  make  science  and
math captivating.

Although these agencies have made commendable efforts to share their knowledge
and  passion  for  science  with  students,  I  fear  that  those  efforts  have  been  relatively
small  and  have  varied  widely  in  their  methods,  target  audiences,  and  methods  of
evaluation.  The  programs  have  been  developed  independently  and  without  a  stra-
tegic  plan  for  accomplishing  a  common  set  of  goals  and  objectives.  With  a  unified
effort, I am convinced that these programs could have a much bigger impact on the
approximately 52 million K–12 students in America.

We have asked our witnesses today to tell us about their experiences participating
in  these  programs.  We  have  asked  them  to  respond  to  a  series  of  questions:  What
do  the  agencies  do  well?  What  should  they  improve?  Which  programs  do  educators
consider successful? And how do they define that success?

The  Committee  is  devoted  to  improving  science  education—so  devoted  that  we
added  science  education  to  the  name  of  this  subcommittee.  We  are  very  concerned
that  American  students  are  not  achieving  their  potential  in  science  and  math  edu-
cation.  This  is  a  concern  not  only  as  we  look  at  competing  in  a  knowledge-based
global  economy,  but  also  when  we  look  at  access  to  high-paying,  technology-based
jobs in this country.

I look forward to hearing from today’s witnesses.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Baird,  and  I  do
apologize  to  you  and  to  the  group  for  my  due  late  arrival.  I  was
speaking  at  another  session,  and  unfortunately  I  ended  up  being
the last speaker; and even though it was difficult for me, I did cut
my words short.

I am pleased today that we have a cadre of consumers of science,
technology,  engineering  and  mathematics,  better  known  as  STEM
educational  programs  across  the  federal  agencies  before  us  to  hear
about their experiences.

I believe it is the desire of all Members of the Science and Tech-
nology Committee that we support the implementation of programs
that are well-designed and effective. But often as legislators we are
so distanced from the final implementation of the programs that we
hear  little  about  personal  challenges  and  personal  successes,  and
this  is  an  opportunity  for  us  to  hear  what  some  of  our  grand
schemes have resulted in and hear it from the people who are sort
of the boots on the ground in the STEM education battle.

Today’s  hearing  will  delve  into  what  was  happening  with  the
consumers  of  federal  STEM  agency  programs.  I  might  mention
many  of  these  programs  don’t  come  directly  from  this  committee.
There  are  a  number  of  federal  agencies  that  instigate  their  own
programs  without  Congressional  direction,  and  I  have  worried  for
some years how those all intertwine with each other and with what
we have passed.

While  each  of  our  panelists  brings  unique  perspectives  to  the
table  today,  I  note  there  are  a  few  common  themes  running
through  your  prepared  testimony.  Several  of  you  have  identified
the  Federal  Science  and  Technology  Workforce  and  Facilities  and
under-utilized  resources  for  K–12  classrooms.  I  am  interested  to
learn  more  about  programs  that  successfully  leverage  these  re-
sources.

Secondly,  many  of  you  remarked  that  the  best  programs  are
those  that  excite  and  inform  teachers  and  students.  Finally,  your
testimony,  coupled  with  the  recent  release  of  the  Academic  Com-

petitiveness  Council’s  report  on  federal  STEM  programs  empha-
sizes a need to reduce the number of programs that are not evalu-
ated  or  clearly  do  not  provide  a  benefit  to  teachers  and  students.
Alternatively,  faced  with  a  maze  of  resources,  you  need  help
identifying  programs  that  have  been  evaluated  as  successful  to
know what may be useful to you.

Our  challenge  in  Congress  is  to  target  limited  federal  funds  at
programs  which  leverage  relevant  federal  resources  and  also  com-
plement the local education requirement.

Today  we  will  have  achieved  a  win-win  scenario  to  promote
STEM  literacy  at  all  levels  if  we  manage  to  do  that.  I  am  particu-
larly  pleased  to  see  that  today’s  panel  includes  Michael  Lach.  As
an  Einstein  Fellow  in  my  office  from  1999  to  2000,  Michael  pro-
vided  extremely  valuable  insight  to  me  on  STEM  education  and
science  policy.  He  has  moved  onto  much  grander  things,  now  di-
recting  the  math  and  science  curricula  for  the  entire  Chicago  Pub-
lic  School  System.  He  has  been  an  outspoken  pioneer  for  effective
teaching  in  math  and  science  from  the  time  that  he  started  teach-
ing high school science through the Teach for America program.

Granted  that  I  will  allow  that  I  am  a  little  biased  since  Michael
is  a  physicist  by  training,  but  I  have  been  told  by  others  that  he
is  an  exceptional  teacher,  one  that  other  teachers  look  up  to  as  an
example that they aspire to be. We are fortunate to have him here
today. Welcome Michael, and for that I yield back.

Several  of  you  have  identified  the  federal  science  and  technology  workforce  and  fa-

Chairman BAIRD. Thank you, Dr. Ehlers. If there are other Mem-
bers  who  wish  to  submit  additional  opening  statements,  the  state-
ments will be added to the record.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Our  nation’s  future  competitiveness  depends  on
whether  or  not  tomorrow’s  generation  is  prepared  for  the  high-tech  jobs  of  the  fu-
ture.

Enthusiastic,  adequately  prepared  teachers  who  utilize  successful  teaching  meth-

ods are needed in many of today’s math and science classrooms.

Mr.  Chairman,  the  Federal  Government  must  invest  in  math  and  science  edu-

cation, as these investments help fuel our nation’s economic growth.

Economists  agree  that  no  other  investment  generates  a  greater  long-term  return
to  the  economy  than  scientific  R&D,  and  that  starts  with  educational  systems.  Re-
search,  education,  the  technical  workforce,  scientific  discovery,  innovation  and  eco-
nomic growth are intertwined.

The  Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and  Math  Caucus  has  reported  that  Texas
ranked 20th in the Nation on the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress
scores for mathematics with a score of 281. The national average was 278.

Texas did not report on the percentage of Texas middle school teachers who were
certified  in  math  (the  national  average  was  49  percent)  or  science  (the  national  av-
erage was 54 percent).

Sadly,  only  seven  percent  of  Texas’  12th  grade  students  took  the  AP  Calculus
exam  in  2004.  Students  should  be  challenged  so  that  they  are  able  to  master  these
subjects, if we want to compete globally.

Today’s  witnesses  are  here  to  provide  a  critical  view  of  federal  STEM  education
programs.  Members  of  Congress  need  to  know  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  work
so that we can build policies that offer the most benefit per taxpayer dollar.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman  BAIRD.  At  this  time  I  would  like  to  introduce  the  wit-
nesses  on  the  panel.  Ms.  Linda  Froschauer  is  the  President  of  Na-
tional  Science  Teachers  Association.  She  is  also  the  K–12  Science
Department  Chair  for  the  Weston  Public  Schools  in  Weston,  Con-
necticut.  It  is  good  to  have  you  with  us  again.  We  always  value
your  remarks  and  insights.  Mr.  Michael  Lach  is  the  Director  of
Mathematics and Science for Chicago Public Schools. Dr. George D.
Nelson  is  Director  of  the  Science,  Mathematics,  and  Technology
Education  and  is  Professor  of  Physics  and  Astronomy  at  Western
Washington  University,  my  home  state.  He  is  a  former  astronaut
and  flew  on  the  Space  Shuttle.  Mr.  Van  Reiner  is  the  President  of
the Maryland Science Center and formerly was the President of the
Sparrow  Point  Division  of  Bethlehem  Steel.  And  Dr.  Iris  Weiss  is
President  of  Horizon  Research,  Incorporated,  which  specializes  in
mathematics  and  science  education  and  research  evaluation.  As
you can see, we have a very distinguished and well-qualified panel
before us today to learn from.

I  would  remind  our  witnesses—first  of  all,  we  have  all  had  a
chance to look at your written testimony. Thank you for preparing
that,  some  of  it  quite  lengthy,  but  very,  very  informative;  but  I
would remind you that today for the purpose of testimony—spoken
testimony  is  limited  to  five  minutes  each.  There  are  little  lights
there  that  will  come  on;  and  as  Dr.  Ehlers  used  to  remind  people,
after  the  red  light  comes  on,  you  have  about  five  seconds  and  a
trapdoor  appears  underneath  your  chair  and  you  disappear  from
sight,  after  which  Members  of  the  Subcommittee  will  have  five
minutes  each  to  ask  questions.  This  is  a  collegial,  friendly  atmos-
phere,  so  we  very  much  look  forward  to  a  good  exchange  of  ideas.

And with that, we will start with Ms. Froschauer.
STATEMENT OF MS. LINDA K. FROSCHAUER, PRESIDENT,

NATIONAL SCIENCE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

Ms.  FROSCHAUER.  Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  present  tes-

timony on behalf of the National Science Teachers Association.

My  name  is  Linda  Froschauer,  and  I  am  the  President  of  the
NSTA. For 32 years I have been a science teacher, currently teach-
ing  eighth-grade  science,  and  I  am  Department  Chair  at  Weston
Middle School in Connecticut.

This  is  the  second  opportunity  I  have  had  in  recent  months  to
testify  before  this  subcommittee.  A  few  weeks  ago  I  appeared  in
support of H.R. 524 which is for Partnerships for Access to Labora-
tory Science Grants. I want to sincerely thank the Members of the
Science  Committee  and  the  House  for  passing  this  extremely  im-
portant legislation as part of H.R. 362.

Today  I  would  like  to  talk  about  federal  STEM  education  pro-
grams for K–12 teachers. As you know, the vast majority of STEM
education  programs  are  generated  from  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education  and  the  National  Science  Foundation.  We  consider  the
NSF  to  be  the  engine  of  innovation  for  K–12  STEM  education.  In-
formation about NSF initiatives and other federal STEM education
programs are promoted extensively through NSTA print and online
channels  and  on  the  NSTA  website.  Combined,  these  communica-
tion vehicles reach hundreds of thousands of teachers, teacher lead-
ers, and others in the science education community.

Federal  agencies  also  share  information  about  programs  for
science  educators  at  the  NSTA  conferences  which  draw  approxi-
mately 12,000 teachers each year.

During  the  last  NSTA  conference,  the  National  Institutes  of
Health  featured  the  NIH  Research  Zone,  a  coordinated  effort  that
involved  27  institutes  and  centers  from  NIH  professional  societies
and  other  supporting  partners.  The  NIH  Research  Zone  provided
one-stop  shopping  for  teachers  interested  in  discovering  the  re-
sources  available  from  the  NIH  research  community.  Workshops
and  exhibits  on  NASA’s  education  programs  are  also  prominent
parts  of  NSTA  conferences.  These  include  the  NASA  Educator  As-
tronaut  Launch  where  teachers  can  join  NASA’s  first  educator  as-
tronaut,  Barbara  Morgan,  on  her  upcoming  Shuttle  launch.  The
Student Observation Network, 21st Century Explorer, and the En-
gineering  Design  Challenge  allow  students  to  use  NASA  data  to
conduct  their  own  analysis  and  apply  engineering  principles  to
solve scientific problems.

One  of  the  challenges  with  many  federal  education  programs,
however,  is  that  they  reach  only  a  miniscule  proportion  of  our  na-
tion’s science teachers. We must continue to find new and effective
ways to get quality, professional development programs up to scale
so they reach a large number of teachers.

To address this issue, NSTA is working with NASA, NOAA, and
the  FDA  to  develop  face-to-face  training  and  online  experiences
that  we  believe  have  potential  to  reach  hundreds  of  thousands  of
K–12 teachers. Why is professional development so important? Last
year the National Research Council report titled Taking Science to
School,  Learning  and  Teaching  Science  in  Grades  K–8,  said  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:21 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

12

professional  development  is  key  to  supporting  effective  science  in-
struction in the critical early years of a child’s education. All teach-
ers  need  opportunities  to  deepen  their  knowledge  of  the  science
content. In fact, the NRC and Taking Science to School Report says
that federal agencies that support professional development should
require that the programs they fund incorporate models of instruc-
tion  that  combine  the  four  strands  of  science  proficiency,  focus  on
core ideas in science, and enhance teacher’s science content knowl-
edge,  knowledge  of  how  students  learn  science,  and  knowledge  of
how to teach science.

In  conclusion,  recent  reports  have  made  it  clear  that  better  co-
ordination and communication is desperately needed among federal
agencies,  bureaus,  divisions,  and  centers  that  are  involved  with
STEM  education  research  and  programs.  The  federal  agencies  do
not  appear  to  work  together  to  facilitate  the  dissemination  of  re-
search or to discuss possible new ideas and avoid those duplicative
programs.  In  addition,  an  inventory  of  STEM  education  programs
across  the  federal  agencies  would  inform  future  priorities  and  ini-
tiatives,  an  oversight  entity  at  the  federal  level  that  works  to  co-
ordinate STEM education programs and could work with state and
local  officials  and  with  science  education  stakeholders  is  critical.
Improvements in STEM education require a commitment of leader-
ship  at  the  local,  State,  and  federal  levels.  Education  programs  at
the  federal  agencies  should  continue  to  play  a  role  in  improving
STEM education.

We hope that any changes to existing programs, especially at the
National  Science  Foundation,  that  may  come  about  as  a  result  of
this  ACC  report  will  be  carefully  reviewed  and  considered.  Thank
you  for  allowing  me  the  opportunity  to  address  you  today,  and  I
look forward to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Froschauer follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF LINDA K. FROSCHAUER

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  present  testimony  on  behalf  of  the  National
Science Teachers Association. My name is Linda Froschauer, and I am President of
the  NSTA.  For  32  years  I  have  been  a  science  teacher  and  I  am  currently  an  8th
grade  science  teacher  and  Department  Chair  at  the  Weston  Public  Schools  in  Con-
necticut.

This  is  the  second  opportunity  I  have  had  in  recent  months  to  testify  before  this
subcommittee.  A  few  months  ago  I  appeared  in  support  of  H.R.  524,  the  Partner-
ships  for  Access  to  Laboratory  Science  grants.  I  want  to  sincerely  thank  the  mem-
bers  of  the  Science  Committee  and  the  House  for  passing  this  extremely  important
legislation as part of H.R. 362.

Today I will talk about the Federal STEM education programs for K–12 teachers.
As  you  know  the  vast  majority  of  STEM  education  programs  originate  from  the
U.S. Department of Education and the National Science Foundation. Strengthening
science and math education is a core mission of the NSF.

Science  education  is  unique  because  it  is  concerned  with  the  special  character  of
science and its related disciplines—it is at once a body of knowledge and a dynamic
questioning  activity.  Because  of  the  nature  of  science  it  is  important  to  have  sci-
entists  involved  in  critical  questions  of  science  education.  It  was  the  recognition  of
this  interdependence  between  scientists  and  the  science  education  enterprise  that
drove the identification of science education as a key part of the NSF agenda when
the agency was founded.

We  consider  the  NSF  to  be  the  engine  of  innovation  for  K–12  STEM  education.
The new NSF Education and Human Resources Division of Research on Learning
in  Formal  and  Informal  Settings—known  as  DRL—is  working  to  advance  discovery
and  innovation  at  the  frontiers  of  STEM  learning  and  teaching.  NSF  supports  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:21 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

13

highly  innovative  models  and  approaches  to  learning  in  formal  and  informal  set-
tings.  NSF  works  to  advance  equity  and  participation  for  all,  to  foster  linkages  be-
tween  STEM  education  research  and  practice,  and  to  unite  education  research  and
evaluation activities across the Foundation and with other federal agencies.

The NSF has the capacity to incorporate the best from both the science and edu-
cation R&D communities and can enlist scientists, academicians and researchers in
a  peer  review  process  that  generates  and  tests  innovations  in  science-related  dis-
ciplines for education. Unlike the Department of Education, the NSF has the ability
to  tap  into  basic  cognitive  research,  fold  in  new  content  and  new  ways  of  teaching
this  content  from  the  disciplines,  and  explore  new  technologies  for  the  delivery  of
professional development and for assessing teachers and their students.

One  of  the  most  effective  education  programs  at  NSF  is  the  Math  and  Science
Partnerships.  An  analysis  of  123  schools  participating  in  the  NSF  MSP  program
shows continued increases in student proficiency in math and science since the pro-
gram  was  first  established  in  2002.  Students  showed  the  most  significant  improve-
ments  in  mathematics  proficiency,  with  a  13.7  percent  increase  for  elementary,  6.2
percent  increase  for  middle  school,  and  17.1  percent  increase  for  high-school  stu-
dents. Science proficiency at each level showed marked gains as well, with a 5.3 per-
cent increase for elementary, 4.5 percent increase for middle school, and 1.4 percent
increase for high-school students.

African-American, Hispanic, and white students showed significant improvements
in elementary level mathematics, as did students designated as special education or
as limited English-proficiency students.

In addition to working with NSF on a MSP grant, NSTA has worked directly with
federal  agencies  such  as  NASA,  NOAA,  and  FDA  to  develop  a  combination  of  face-
to-face  training  and  online  experiences  that  we  believe  has  the  potential  to  reach
hundreds of thousands of K–12 science teachers.

NASA, NOAA, DOT and the FDA have partnered with NSTA to develop SciPacks
on  topics  supporting  their  mission.  SciPacks  are  designed  for  educators  who  want
or need to learn core science content. SciPacks contain three to five Science Objects,
which are stand-alone, content-based units aligned with National Science Education
Standards  and  Benchmarks  for  Science  Literacy.  These  discrete  online  learning  ex-
periences  are  especially  beneficial  to  teachers  who  are  forced  to  teach  out-of-field,
elementary  and  middle  level  teachers  who  lack  degrees  in  science,  or  those  who
need to increase their science knowledge of a particular content area.

Each SciPak also contains a pedagogical implications section highlighting age-ap-
propriate  concepts  and  common  student  misconceptions.  Teachers  utilizing  SciPaks
get  individualized  e-mail  support  from  a  content  expert  and  can  complete  a  graded
assessment demonstrating content mastery.

SciPacks  recently  unveiled  in  the  NSTA  Learning  Center  focus  on  these  content
areas:  Gravity  and  Orbits;  the  Universe  and  the  Solar  System;  Earth,  Sun  and
Moon;  Coral  Reef  Ecosystems;  Ocean’s  Effect  on  Weather  and  Climate;  Plate  Tec-
tonics, The Rock Cycle, Force and Motion and Energy.

In  addition,  thousands  of  teachers  have  taken  advantage  of  weekly  NSTA  Web
Seminars on these topics. In addition NSTA Symposiums provide face-to-face train-
ing with experts on these content areas from federal agencies, who interact one-on-
one with K–12 teachers.

Other  STEM  education  programs  from  federal  agencies  are  promoted  extensively
through NSTA print and online channels, and on the NSTA website. These commu-
nication vehicles reach hundreds of thousands of teachers, teacher leaders, and oth-
ers in the science education community.

Federal  agencies  also  share  information  about  programs  for  science  educators  at

the NSTA conferences, which draw approximately 25,000 teachers each year.

During  the  last  NSTA  annual  conference  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  fea-
tured  the  NIH  Research  Zone,  a  coordinated  effort  that  involved  27  institutes  and
centers from NIH professional societies and other supporting partners. The NIH Re-
search  Zone  provided  one  stop  shopping  for  teachers  interested  in  discovering  the
resources  available  from  the  NIH  research  community.  The  groups  represented  in-
cluded  the  National  Biomedical  Imaging  and  Bioengineering;  the  National  Center
for  Research  Resources;  the  National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute;  the  Na-
tional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the National Institute of General
Medical  Sciences;  the  National  Institute  of  Neurological  Disorders  and  Stroke;  the
National  Institutes  of  Health  Office  of  Science  Education;  the  National  Library  of
Medicine; and the Society for Neuroscience.

In addition, the NIH Office of Science Education provides medical and life science
curriculum  supplements  for  grades  K–12,  as  well  as  posters  and  videos  promoting
health science careers.

Workshops  and  exhibits  on  NASA’s  education  programs  are  also  prominent  at
NSTA  conferences.  These  include  the  NASA  Educator  Astronaut  Launch,  where
teachers  can  join  NASA’s  first  educator  astronaut,  Barbara  Morgan,  on  her  flight
to  the  International  Space  Station  later  this  summer.  NASA  is  offering  a  website,
classroom activities and challenges to teachers and students.

Other NASA programs highlighted at the conference include the Student Observa-
tion Network, 21st Century Explorer, and the Engineering Design Challenge. These
programs allow students to use NASA data to conduct their own analyses and apply
engineering  principles  to  solve  scientific  problems.  The  NASA  Smart  Skies  features
a  web-based  simulator  with  real  world  air  traffic  control  motion  problems  between
two  or  more  planes.  Students  apply  proportional  reasoning  and  distance  rate  time
relationships to resolve conflicts by changing plane routes and speeds.

While  I  cannot  speak  to  the  efficacy  or  the  outcomes  of  these  federal  programs,
we  have  found  that  many  of  these  programs  do  provide  key  research  and  content
to  classroom  teachers  and  help  to  excite  teachers  and  students  about  science.  One
of the challenges with federal education programs, however, is that they reach only
a  minuscule  proportion  of  our  nation’s  science  teachers.  We  must  find  new  ways  to
get  proven,  effective  professional  development  programs  up  to  scale  so  they  reach
a large number of teachers.

Why  is  professional  development  so  important?  Last  year  the  National  Research
Council  report  titled  Taking  Science  to  School:  Learning  and  Teaching  Science  in
Grades  K–8  said  that  professional  development  was  key  to  supporting  effective
science instruction in the critical, early years of a child’s education. The NRC called
for  a  dramatic  departure  from  current  professional  development  practice,  both  in
scope and kind.

All  teachers  need  opportunities  to  deepen  their  knowledge  of  the  science  content.
The NRC also believes that teachers need opportunities to learn how students learn
science and how to teach it. They need to know how children’s understanding of core
ideas in science builds across K–8, not just at a given grade or grade band. Teachers
need  to  learn  about  the  conceptual  ideas  that  students  have  in  the  earliest  grades
and their ideas about science itself. They need to learn how to assess children’s de-
veloping  ideas  over  time  and  how  to  interpret  and  respond  (instructionally)  to  the
results of assessment.

In  short,  teachers  need  opportunities  to  learn  how  to  teach  science  as  an  inte-
grated body of knowledge and practice—to teach for scientific proficiency. They need
to  learn  how  to  teach  science  to  diverse  student  populations,  and  to  provide  ade-
quate opportunities for all students to learn science.

We  believe  federal  agencies  have  a  key  role  in  providing  programs  that  will  en-
hance teacher content knowledge, help them to deliver effective instruction, and pro-
vide insight into how students learn.

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  NRC  report  also  asserts  that  ‘‘Federal  agencies
that support professional development should require that the programs they fund in-
corporate  models  of  instruction  that  combine  the  four  strands  of  science  proficiency;
focus  on  core  ideas  in  science;  and  enhance  teachers’  science  content  knowledge,
knowledge of how students learn science, and knowledge of how to teach science.’’

Looking  to  the  future  we  anticipate  that  the  soon-to-be  released  Academic  Com-
petitiveness Council report on the myriad of federal STEM education programs will
bring about needed changes.

From  our  observations,  there  is  an  overlap  in  many  of  the  programs  offered  at

the federal level.

There  is  no  oversight  entity  at  the  federal  level  that  works  to  coordinate  these
STEM  programs.  The  federal  agencies  do  not  appear  to  work  together  to  facilitate
the dissemination of research, or to discuss possible new ideas and avoid duplicative
programs.

We  believe  that  better  coordination  and  communication  is  desperately  needed
among  federal  agencies,  bureaus,  divisions,  and  centers  that  are  involved  with
STEM education research and programs.

Finally  an  inventory  of  STEM  education  programs  across  the  federal  agencies
would  inform  future  priorities  and  initiatives.  Federal  agencies  should  also  work  to
coordinate  their  STEM  education  initiatives  with  states,  local  districts,  the  higher
education community, and other key stakeholders.

Improvements  in  STEM  education  require  a  commitment  of  leadership  at  the
local,  state,  and  federal  levels.  Education  programs  at  the  federal  agencies  will  al-
ways  have  a  critical  role  to  play  in  improving  STEM  education.  We  hope  that  any
changes  to  existing  programs,  especially  at  the  National  Science  Foundation,  that
may be come about as a result of the Academic Competitiveness Council report will
be carefully reviewed and considered.

National Science Teachers Association President, 2006–2007

BIOGRAPHY FOR LINDA K. FROSCHAUER

Linda  K.  Froschauer,  K–8  Science  Department  Chair  at  the  Weston  Public
Schools, in Weston Connecticut, is president of the National Science Teachers Asso-
ciation (NSTA). She began her one-year term on June 1, 2006.

Froschauer has been a devoted teacher and dedicated leader in science education.
She began her teaching career as an elementary school teacher in Matteson, Illinois;
moved  on  to  middle  level  teaching  at  the  Greenwich  Public  Schools,  in  Greenwich,
Connecticut; and has been with the Weston Public Schools since 1985. She combines
her  work  in  the  classroom  with  a  leadership  role  in  her  school,  serving  as  grades
K–8  Science  Department  Chair/mentor  teacher.  Outside  the  classroom  she  has
worked as an instructor for Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry; as a writer/
consultant for many publications; and as a field editor, reviewer, and consultant for
numerous organizations.

For  more  than  30  years,  Froschauer  has  been  a  leader  and  active  member  of
NSTA.  In  1976,  she  was  named  the  first  Preschool/Elementary  Division  Director  to
serve  on  the  NSTA  Board  of  Directors.  She  later  worked  on  many  NSTA  commit-
tees, including the International Convention Planning Committee, the Preschool/El-
ementary  Committee,  and  the  Informal  Education  Committee,  and  she  has  chaired
both  the  Awards  and  Recognition  Committee  and  the  Committee  on  Nominations.
She  also  has  served  as  Middle  Level  Division  Director,  worked  on  the  Committee
and  Board  Operations  Task  Force,  and  led  the  development  of  NSTA’s  first  Family
Science Day, which was held in conjunction with the NSTA National Convention in
Boston.

Froschauer’s devotion to science education is evidenced by her involvement in nu-
merous  other  professional  organizations.  She  has  served  as  president  of  the  Con-
necticut Science Supervisors Association (CSSA), the National Middle Level Science
Teachers  Association  (NMLSTA),  and  the  Council  for  Elementary  Science  Inter-
national  (CESI).  She  is  also  a  member  of  the  Connecticut  Academy  for  Education
in  Mathematics,  Science,  and  Technology;  the  Association  of  Presidential  Awardees
in Science Teaching; and the Society of Elementary Presidential Awardees. She has
been actively involved in Project 2061, a national effort to improve science education
sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Froschauer  was  chosen  as  a  Connecticut  Science  Educators  Fellow  and  named
Weston Teacher of the Year in 1999. Her other awards and accomplishments include
receiving the NSTA Distinguished Teaching Award, Middle Level, in 2001; National
Board  for  Professional  Teaching  Standards  certification,  also  in  2001;  the  CSSA
Charles  Simone  Award  for  Outstanding  Leadership  in  Science  Education  in  1998;
a  Presidential  Award  for  Excellence  in  Mathematics  and  Science  Teaching  in  1993;
and  the  Educational  Press  Association  of  America’s  Distinguished  Achievement
Award in 1991.

Froschauer earned a BS degree in education from Northern Illinois University, an
MA  in  science  teaching  from  Governors  State  University,  and  a  sixth-year  degree
in curriculum and supervision from Southern Connecticut State University.

Chairman BAIRD. Thank you, Ms. Froschauer. Mr. Lach.

STATEMENT OF MR. MICHAEL C. LACH, DIRECTOR OF

MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE, CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
Mr.  LACH.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  here  today  to  speak  to  you
about  this  issue.  It  is  an  honor  to  sit  before  you  along  side  col-
leagues who I have worked with and learned much from.

We  have  made  great  progress  with  mathematics  and  science  in-
struction  in  Chicago.  Student  performance  has  risen  considerably
over  the  past  five  years,  and  our  rate  of  improvement  is  greater
than  that  of  the  rest  of  the  state.  To  do  this,  we  developed  a  com-
prehensive  plan  to  coordinate  all  aspects  of  mathematics  and
science  improvement  which  we  call  the  Chicago  Math  and  Science
Initiative. As part of this work, we created a vision for high-quality

instruction; built the support infrastructure to provide high-quality,
content-rich,  professional  development  to  thousands  of  teachers
over the course of an academic year; forged partnerships with local
businesses, museums, laboratories, and universities to increase the
content knowledge of our teachers; and enhanced their after-school
offerings  to  include  mathematics  and  science  enrichment.  We  have
done this in the traditional urban context. Most of our students are
poor, our facilities are crumbling, and we are limited on resources.
I would argue that there are two major assets of the federal R&D
mission  agencies  that  will  help  K–12  STEM  education.  The  first
asset  is  human  capital.  The  scientists  and  engineers  of  NASA,
NOAA,  NIST,  EPA,  and  the  Department  of  Energy  are  the  best
and  brightest  in  the  world.  They  are  the  ones  making  new  discov-
eries, creating new technologies, and literally exploring new worlds.
The  more  we  can  connect  students,  parents,  and  teachers  with
their insights, energy, and perspectives, the better.

The  second  major  asset  is  the  facilities.  The  laboratories  and
tools  that  are  part  of  a  federal  R&D  infrastructure  are  top  notch,
the  particle  accelerators,  the  spacecraft,  the  computers,  the  data
sets.  Most  of  our  students  have  a  very  incomplete  picture  of  the
real  work  of  scientists  and  engineers.  Many  teachers  have  never
been  part  of  a  real  scientific  project.  The  facilities  that  are  part  of
the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  should  be  utilized  not  only  to
ground science learning in a well-defined context but to enable stu-
dents and teachers to grasp a vision of what they are trying to do.
Communication  between  districts  and  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies generally differs by the amount of collaboration that is in-
tended  in  the  partnership.  The  projects  that  are  designed  by  the
federal R&D mission agencies, individual teachers and schools find
them  by  the  usual  methods,  NSTA  mailings  and  publications,
websites, email lists. We regularly email our teachers of any oppor-
tunities  that  we  hear  about,  and  generally  because  of  our  lack  of
resources, it is unconscionable for me not to encourage our teachers
to participate in anything.

The  more  strategic  partnerships,  programs  are  often  developed
jointly  and  are  the  result  of  an  ongoing  dialogue  so  the  strengths
of the partnering institutions are all leveraged. These partnerships
require  intense  collaboration  and  flexibility  from  all  sides  as  well
as resources to support and create and maintain them. In my writ-
ten  comments,  I  have  mentioned  several  partnerships  we  have
used with Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory.

The federal R&D mission agencies have an important role to play
in improving K–12 STEM education. By leveraging the human cap-
ital and facilities these possess and connecting these to the existing
plans  and  strategies  of  districts  we  will  collectively  be  able  to  ad-
vance the mathematic and science achievement of our students.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL C. LACH

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here
today  to  speak  to  you  about  this  issue.  It  is  an  honor  to  sit  before  you  alongside
colleagues whom I’ve worked with and learned much from.

I am the Director of Mathematics and Science for the Chicago Public Schools. The
Chicago  Public  School  system  consists  of  over  600  schools,  nearly  25,000  teachers,
and more than 400,000 students.

We  have  made  great  progress  with  mathematics  and  science  instruction  in  Chi-
cago.  Student  performance  has  risen  considerably  over  the  past  five  years,  and  the
rate  of  improvement  is  faster  than  that  of  the  state.  (See  Figure  1  and  Figure  2.)
To  do  this,  we  developed  a  comprehensive  plan  to  coordinate  all  aspects  of  mathe-
matics and science improvement, which we call the Chicago Math & Science Initia-
tive. As part of this work, we created a vision for high quality instruction; built the
support  infrastructure  to  provide  high  quality,  content-rich  professional  develop-
ment to thousands of teachers over the course of an academic year; forged partner-
ships with local businesses, museums, laboratories, and universities to increase the
content  knowledge  of  our  teachers;  and  enhanced  our  after-school  offerings  to  in-
clude mathematics and science enrichment.

We’ve done this in a challenging context. Eighty-five percent of our students come
from  low-income  families.  Our  resources  are  low;  Illinois  ranks  47th  in  the  Nation
in  the  level  of  state  support  for  education.  Our  capacity  is  limited—less  than  five
percent of our K–8 teachers possess a State endorsement in mathematics. The Chi-
cago Public Schools is an extremely decentralized school district. By State law, deci-
sions  about  local  school  budgets,  principal  contracts,  and  curriculum  are  made  by
an  elected  body  called  the  ‘‘Local  School  Council,’’  not  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.
While  we  feel  proud  of  our  accomplishments,  we  know  that  we  still  have  much
work  to  do.  An  achievement  gap  remains  in  many  of  our  schools.  The  number  of
students  meeting  and  exceeding  standards  remains  far  too  low.  Our  high  schools,
in particular, still have graduation rates that are not acceptable.

In  as  much  as  possible,  we  connect  with  external  resources  to  help  us  improve
mathematics and science in the Chicago Public Schools. Much of the intellectual de-
sign  of  our  work  comes  from  insights  my  colleagues  on  this  panel  have  provided,
from  Dr.  Nelson’s  leadership,  to  Dr.  Weiss’s  insightful  evaluations  of  large-scale
change efforts, and to the National Science Teacher Association’s consistent support
for  teachers.  Most  of  the  funding  for  our  efforts  comes  from  the  district;  we  work
in every manner possible to leverage additional funding from corporate and univer-
sity  partners  in  the  Chicagoland  area.  In  particular,  we’re  happy  to  have  several
major universities that we work with in close partnership, and our relationship with
Argonne  National  Laboratory  has  resulted  in  several  programs  that  we  have  en-
acted together.

The  gaps  we  face,  and  the  resource  and  capacity  limitations  that  we  operate
under make it unconscionable for us to turn down assistance. So my most important
point  today  is  that  we  really  depend  on  the  assistance  and  partnership  of  others—
including  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies.  They  have  an  important  role  to  place
in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  education  in  the  United
States.

I’d  argue  that  there  are  two  major  assets  of  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies
that  will  help  K–12  STEM  education.  As  the  Committee  considers  the  most  appro-
priate  way  to  connect  these  agencies  with  K–12  teachers  and  schools,  programs
should be designed so that these assets are highlighted.

The  first  asset  is  human  capital.  The  scientists  and  engineers  of  NASA,  NOAA,
NIST,  EPA  and  DOE  are  the  best  and  brightest  in  the  world.  They  are  the  ones
making  new  discoveries,  creating  new  technologies,  and  literally  exploring  new
worlds.  The  more  we  can  connect  students,  parents,  and  teachers  with  their  in-
sights,  energy,  and  perspectives,  the  better.  The  people  of  federal  R&D  mission
agencies  can  both  educate  and  inspire  our  students  and  teachers.  A  key  priority
should be to leverage this human capital so that they can assist schools and school
districts in their work.

The  second  major  asset  is  the  facilities.  The  laboratories  and  tools  that  are  part
of the federal R&D infrastructure are top notch—the particle accelerators, the space
craft, the computers, the data sets. Most of our students have a very incomplete pic-
ture  of  the  real  work  of  scientists  and  engineers.  Many  teachers  have  never  been
part  of  a  real  scientific  project.  The  facilities  that  are  part  of  the  federal  R&D  mis-
sion agencies should be utilized not only to ground science learning in a well defined
context, but to enable students and teachers to understand a vision of what they’re
trying  to  do.  A  second  key  priority  of  the  federal  R&D  thus  is  to  make  the  places
where  science  and  engineering  are  practices  accessible  in  meaningful  ways  to  stu-
dents and teachers.

I’d  like  to  highlight  a  few  examples  of  these  that  come  from  my  experience  with

Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab.

• The Academies Creating Teacher Scientists program provides summer intern-
ships  for  teachers  to  conduct  scientific  research  with  ANL  scientists.1 In  this
program, both the human capital and the facilities of ANL are made available
to select teachers in a sustained, supportive manner.
• Fermilab’s  Saturday  Morning  Physics  sessions—in  which  I  participated  as  a
student—brings  students  to  Fermilab  to  learn  about  modern  physics  topics
and  see  real  scientists  in  action.2 Similarly,  Argonne’s  distance  learning
project  uses  modern  technology  to  provide  the  opportunity  for  CPS  students
to meet and interact with professionals in technical fields.3 Both of these pro-
grams enable students to access the human capital and facilities of these lab-
oratories.
• The  online  ask-a-scientist  provides  a  mechanism  for  student  and  teachers  to
• And,  in  an  expression  of  our  work  as  partners,  the  director  of  education  at

get accurate answers to scientific questions from practicing scientists.4

Argonne participates in our annual Principal For A Day project.

Given  these  comments,  a  picture  emerges  about  the  sort  of  work  that  isn’t  very
helpful. Curriculum development is one. We know from decades of instructional ma-
terial  development  that  writing  curriculum  is  a  complicated,  difficult  process.  More
acutely,  we  know  that  robust  curriculum  is  necessary  but  not  sufficient  for  class-
room  improvement.  In  addition  to  strong  materials,  teachers  need  equipment,  pro-
fessional development workshops, coaching, and good assessments. Within a school,
leaders need to understand how to support curriculum implementation, and manage
improvement  throughout  grades  and  courses.  Collections  of  lessons  plans,  by  them-
selves, are only a small piece of the puzzle.

The  proliferation  of  state  and  national  standards  and  content  also  makes  imple-
mentation difficult. Special topics can be motivating and interesting to both teachers
and students, but given the now-famous finding from the TIMSS study that our cur-
riculum  is  ‘‘a  mile  wide  and  an  inch  deep,’’  adding  more  topics  to  cover  only  makes
things difficult for teachers. If programs or projects are parochial, they’re harder to
connect to our work.

We also know that transforming classroom practice involves intensive capacity de-
velopment  sustained  over  time.  It  doesn’t  happen  over  night—or  in  a  one-day  field
trip  or  workshop.  A  brief  visit  to  a  laboratory  or  launch  can  be  inspiring—and  I
don’t mean to downplay the importance of inspiring teachers and students about the
world of science—but real change takes sustained work over time. Within an overall
strategy, there’s certainly a need for both.

I  want  to  say  a  few  words  about  the  type  of  human  capital  development  that  we
provide  for  teachers  at  the  Chicago  Public  Schools.  Our  work  falls  into  three  major
categories.  The  first  is  support  for  core  instructional  materials  implementation,  fo-
cusing  on  the  direct  application  of  content  and  pedagogy  to  the  classroom.  This  is
almost always led by the district, and is difficult to conceive any outside institutions
other than curriculum developers with the capacity to provide this work. The second
is  to  enhance  the  content  knowledge  of  teachers  via  university  course  work.  The
highly qualified teacher demands of the No Child Left Behind legislation as enacted
in Illinois use course work as the main driver for this work. Seminars and sessions
that don’t provide credit for teachers don’t enable me to very easily meet my goals.
The third is activities that inspire the study of science and mathematics; generally,
we  use  outside  institutions  such  as  museums  and  laboratories  to  do  most  of  this
work.

In  the  Chicago  Math  &  Science  Initiative,  the  Chicago  Public  Schools  was  able
to  develop  a  coherent  and  comprehensive  strategy  for  mathematics  and  science  im-
provement thanks to NSF systemic initiatives. It took us some time both to arrange
the  human  capital  and  organization  in  order  to  structure  such  a  strategy,  but  the
results  to  date  are  quite  positive.  The  more  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  can
align their work to similar district strategies, the better the chance of success. With-
out  a  clear  connection  to  district’s  vision,  there  will  be  no  traction.  A  plan  enables
forward movement. And it takes resources to develop and drive such plans.

When the proposals come to me as existing plans with little opportunity for local-
ization,  their  chance  of  effectiveness  is  reduced  considerably.  Small  programs  that
are aligned only peripherally to our strategies often just add complexity. We’ve had
success  because  of  our  commitment  to  coherence,  and  the  more  the  federal  R&D

mission agencies can align with that, the better. I can’t think of any proposals that
have come to me with an evaluation report documenting their effectiveness.

Communication between districts and the federal R&D mission agencies generally
differs  by  the  amount  of  collaboration  that  is  intended  in  the  partnership.  For
projects that are designed by the federal R&D mission agencies, individual teachers
and schools find them by the usual methods—NSTA mailings, websites, e-mail lists.
We  regularly  e-mail  our  teachers  any  opportunities  that  we  hear  about.  For  more
strategic  partnerships,  programs  are  often  developed  jointly  and  are  the  result  of
an  ongoing  dialogue  so  that  the  strengths  of  the  partnering  institutions  are  lever-
aged. These partnerships require intense collaboration and flexibility from all sides.
The  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  have  an  important  role  to  play  in  improving
K–12  STEM  education.  By  leveraging  the  human  capital  land  facilities  that  these
institutions possess, and connecting these to the existing plans and strategies of the
district,  we’ll  collectively  be  able  to  advance  the  mathematics  and  science  achieve-
ment of our students.
Answers
1. How do you find resources for improving science and mathematics edu-

cation in the Chicago Public Schools?
Individual  teachers  find  text,  lesson  plans,  and  other  classroom  resources  via  the
usual methods—NSTA mailings, websites, e-mails. When the central office learns of
opportunities such as this, we distribute them via e-mail to our schools.

More  strategic  partnerships—such  as  the  ones  described  above—come  about  via
ongoing  dialogue  with  our  partners  in  museums,  laboratories,  and  universities.
These are generally designed together.
2. What  resources  have  you  garnered  from  the  federal  R&D  mission  agen-
cies?  How  has  this  contributed  to  improving  your  students’  under-
standing of science?
As  mentioned,  our  partnerships  in  particular  with  Argonne  National  Laboratory
and  the  Fermi  National  Accelerator  Laboratory  have  resulted  in  several  successful
programs that connect teachers and students with the scientists, engineers, and fa-
cilities of these institutions.
3. What  type  of  support  that  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  could  pro-
vide  would  have  the  most  impact  on  STEM  education  for  your  teachers
and students in Chicago Public Schools?
The  most  productive  supports  are  those  that  (1)  inspire  students  and  teachers  to
study  science  and  mathematics  and  (2)  provide  students  and  teachers  with  a  deep
understanding of the real-world work of scientists and engineers. Supports that are
not  particularly  effective  include  (1)  lesson  plans  and  curriculum  development,  (2)
workshops  that  don’t  connect  directly  to  specific  instructional  materials  or  univer-
sity  credit.  To  enable  deeper  collaboration,  resources  need  to  be  allocated  with  the
expressed  purpose  of  connecting  K–12  schools  and  districts  with  the  federal  R&D
mission agencies.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  GEORGE  D.  NELSON,  DIRECTOR  OF
SCIENCE,  TECHNOLOGY,  AND  MATHEMATICS  EDUCATION,
WESTERN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY
Dr.  NELSON.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  the
Committee. My name is Pinky Nelson, and today I am wearing my
science educator hat.

What resources can the mission agencies focus on? The two goals
of literacy and workforce development, have skilled and knowledge-
able  workforce  of  scientists,  engineers  and  technicians  engaged  in
cutting-edge  science  and  technology  development  focused  on  mis-
sions  critical  to  the  country,  research  and  technology  partnerships
with industry and universities, world-class and unique laboratories
and  facilities,  and  the  capacity  for  long-term  funding.  What  re-
sources  do  the  mission  agencies  generally  lack?  Knowledge  of  the
K–12 education system and how it is structured and regulated, in-
ternal expertise in education research, curriculum development, ef-
fective  instruction,  or  teacher  preparation.  The  agencies  should
combine  their  programs  so  those  that  can  take  advantage  of  their
strengths  and  be  sure  to  include  appropriate  partners  when  work-
ing in areas where they lack the expertise. They have the capacity
to sustain and grow programs that are working and axe those that
are not.

Possible areas where I think the mission agencies can contribute
effectively  include  career  pathways  for  high-school  students  and
mission-related  undergraduate  and  graduate  research.  More  chal-
lenging  is  participation  in  K–12  curriculum  development  and  eval-
uation, and teacher preparation.

I  will  briefly  discuss  the  areas  of  challenge  before  moving  on  to
discuss  career  pathways  and  support  for  research.  Working  to-
wards achieving universal literacy by improving K–12 schooling re-
quires  deep  collaboration  with  professionals  across  the  education
system,  often  in  a  non-leadership  role,  creating  the  capacity  and
improving  the  system  comes  first,  the  agencies’  short  and  inter-
mediate-term goals come second.

There  is  a  huge  inventory  of  poorly-designed  and  under-evalu-
ated  mission-related  curricula,  posters,  and  lesson  plans  and  asso-
ciated professional development rarely used in classrooms and with
no  natural  home  in  a  coherent  standards-based  curriculum.  The
constant  barrage  of  new  resources  adds  to  the  noise  in  the  system
and contributes to the mile-wide, inch-deep problem. However, I do
have one positive example. I recently received a copy of an astron-
omy curriculum for grades three to five that was developed collabo-
ratively  by  NASA  and  the  Professional  Science  Educators  and  De-
velopers at the Lawrence Hall of Science at UC–Berkley. It is high-
quality and fills a real need for instructional materials at this level.
A collaborative curriculum development model such as this is rare.
Adding the evaluation component could make it exemplary.

My  current  work  includes  exploring  the  preparation  of  effective
new  STEM  teachers  and  helping  current  teachers  improve  their
practice.  This  is  not  a  part-time  job  or  one  for  the  faint  of  heart.
Agencies  should  encourage  and  provide  incentives  for  their  STEM
retirees  to  become  teachers.  In  addition,  they  should  collaborate
with excellent teacher preparation programs and support their rig-
orous evaluation.

In high schools and community colleges, agencies can collaborate
with  appropriate  education  organizations  and  industry  to  develop
and  support  career  pathways  for  students,  for  example,  in  high
school  in  high-need  areas  like  photonics  or  nanotechnology.  The
agency  can  promote  its  mission  through  carefully  designed,  imple-
mented,  and  evaluated  technology  programs  targeting  the  future
workforce.  These  programs  can  take  full  advantage  of  the  agency
talent pool. The NSF Advanced Technology Education Program has
created some effective models at the community college level. Agen-
cies  could  expand  this  work,  bring  it  into  high  school,  career,  and
technical  education  programs  and  provide  sustaining  funding  that
is not available from NSF R&D programs.

Research  scientists,  engineers,  and  technicians  can  help  muse-
ums or other informal education entities display and communicate,
both  in  real  and  cyberspace,  the  new  science  and  technology  that
is  coming  out  of  the  agencies  to  excite  and  inform  students,  par-
ents,  and  voters.  Additionally,  the  personal  stories  of  STEM  work-
ers  at  all  levels,  including  clear  maps  of  the  paths  through  school
that qualify them for those jobs can help motivate students to enter
career pathways.

Agencies  can  support  undergraduate,  graduate,  and  postdoctoral
students  to  engage  in  mission-related  research  and  then  hire  the
best of them into meaningful jobs. They can provide undergraduate
and graduate students authentic research experiences in their cen-
ters  and  laboratories,  again  with  the  prospect  of  meaningful  jobs.
As  a  graduate  student,  I  spent  two  invaluable  summers  at  the  Air
Force  Cambridge  Research  Laboratory  solar  observatory  in  Sun-
spot, New Mexico.

The  NASA  Space  Grant  program  in  Washington  State  is  a  posi-
tive  example.  NASA  funds  leveraged  with  a  one-to-one  match  sup-
port  around  150  graduate  students  every  year  to  engage  in  STEM
research  mentored  by  faculty  at  institutions  throughout  the  state,
internships at companies, or NASA centers, or participation on stu-
dent design teams. Last year 100 percent of the Space Grant schol-
ar  graduates  went  on  to  STEM  graduate  work  or  employment.
While  the  program  keeps  good  statistics,  it  could  benefit  from  a
more sophisticated effort.

Thank you. I look forward to your questions.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Nelson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GEORGE D. NELSON

Chairman  Baird  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  it  is  a  privilege  to  accept  your
invitation  to  participate  in  the  hearing  and  provide  my  perspective  on  the  STEM
education programs of the federal mission agencies.

My  primary  perspective  comes  from  my  recent  roles  in  STEM  education  reform
as  Directory  of  Science,  Mathematics,  and  Technology  Education  at  Western  Wash-
ington University, and my previous position as Director of Project 2061 at the Amer-
ican  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science.  I  am  also  Principal  Investigator
of a targeted Mathematics and Science Partnership grant from NSF that brings to-
gether  28  regional  school  districts,  Washington  State  LASER,  three  state  commu-
nity colleges, the Northwest Indian College, and Western Washington University in
an  effort  to  reform  science  education  with  a  particular  focus  on  improving  K–16
science teacher preparation.

Personal  experiences  from  previous  positions  have  profoundly  influenced  my  per-
spective  towards  STEM  education  and  general  education  reform.  I  have  worked  as
a  research  astrophysicist,  flown  three  missions  on  the  U.S.  Space  Shuttle  as  a
NASA  astronaut,  served  as  Associate  Vice  Provost  for  Research  at  the  University

of  Washington,  and  taught  at  all  levels  in  higher  education.  I  have  spent  consider-
able  time  thinking  about  and  engaging  in  discussions  with  NASA  and  the  Depart-
ment of Energy about their K–12 education programs, and served on numerous ad-
visory  committees,  commissions,  and  on  boards  of  directors  including  the  Pacific
Science  Center,  the  Art  Institute  of  Seattle,  and  the  Center  for  Occupational  Re-
search and Development (CORD). I am also the proud father of a dedicated and out-
spoken middle school mathematics and science teacher from Katy, Texas.

This  testimony  will  focus  on  the  role  of  the  federal  mission  agencies,  but  it  is  al-
ways good to keep the big picture in mind. The American education system is enor-
mous,  with  over  50  million  students  and  3.1  million  teachers.  Counting  the  critical
role  of  STEM  learning  in  the  elementary  grades,  more  than  half  of  these  teachers
are responsible for teaching mathematics and science. The system is also decentral-
ized,  locally  funded  and  governed,  and  subject  to  myriad  regulations.  Mr.  Lach  has
provided  a  compelling  picture  of  the  Chicago  system.  There  are  15,000  other  dis-
tricts in America, each with its own unique strengths and challenges.

Since  the  federal  mission  agencies  depend  so  heavily  on  both  a  literate  citizenry
for  continued  support  and  STEM  professionals  at  all  levels  to  carry  out  their  mis-
sions,  it  is  in  the  interest  of  the  agencies  to  contribute  appropriately  to  achieving
two  STEM  education  goals:  1)  universal  math  and  science  literacy  and  2)  signifi-
cantly increasing the number and diversity of American students entering and suc-
cessfully exiting the STEM pipeline.

I  shall  now  address  the  Committee’s  specific  questions.  To  approach  a  model  for
how  the  federal  mission  agencies  can  contribute,  it  is  reasonable  to  ask,  what  re-
sources  can  the  mission  agencies  focus  on  the  two  goals  of  literacy  and  workforce
development? Here is my short list.

• A  skilled  and  knowledgeable  workforce  of  scientists,  engineers,  and  techni-
cians engaged in cutting edge science and technology development focused on
missions critical to the country

• Research and technology partnerships with industry and universities
• World-class and unique laboratories and facilities
• Long-term funding.

It is also important to ask, what resources do the mission agencies generally lack?
• Knowledge  of  the  K–12  education  system,  how  it  is  structured  and  regulated
• Internal  expertise  in  education  research,  curriculum  development,  effective

instruction, or teacher preparation.

1. In what ways can federal R&D mission agencies contribute most effectively to im-
prove K–12 STEM education? Can you give examples of particularly effective pro-
grams?
Taking advantage of their strengths, agency professionals can collaborate with ap-
propriate education organizations and industry to develop and support Career Path-
ways for students in high schools and community colleges, for example in high need
areas like photonics or nanotechnology. The agency can promote its mission through
carefully designed, implemented, and evaluated technology education programs tar-
geting  the  future  workforce.  These  programs  can  take  full  advantage  of  the  agency
talent pool. The NSF Advanced Technology Education program has created some ef-
fective models at the community college level. Agencies could expand this work, help
bring it into high school Career and Technical Education programs, and provide sus-
taining funding that is not available from NSF R&D programs.

Research  scientists,  engineers,  and  technicians  can  help  museums  or  other  infor-
mal education entities display and communicate—both in real- and cyberspace—the
new  science  and  technology  that  is  coming  out  of  the  agencies  to  excite  and  inform
students,  parents,  and  voters.  Additionally,  the  personal  stories  of  STEM  workers
at all levels, including clear maps of the paths through school that qualify them for
those jobs can help motivate students to enter the Career Pathways.

My current work includes exploring the preparation of effective new STEM teach-
ers and helping current teachers improve their practice. This is not a part-time job,
or  one  for  the  feint  of  heart.  Agencies  should  encourage  and  provide  incentives  for
their  STEM  retirees  to  become  teachers,  again  making  use  of  their  talented  work-
force. They should also collaborate with excellent teacher preparation programs and
support  their  rigorous  evaluation.  Poor  preparation  for  entering  the  classroom  re-
sults in ineffective instruction and low retention.
2. At  the  undergraduate  level,  what  type  of  support  could  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies  provide  that  would  recruit  more  students  into  pursuing  careers  in  the
physical sciences?

Agencies  can  support  undergraduate,  graduate,  and  postdoctoral  students  to  en-
gage  in  mission-related  research,  and  then  hire  the  best  of  them  into  meaningful
jobs.  They  can  support  students  on  campuses  to  work  with  faculty  engaged  in  mis-
sion-relevant research. They can also provide undergraduate and graduate students
authentic  research  experiences  in  their  centers  and  laboratories—again  with  the
prospect  of  meaningful  jobs.  As  a  graduate  student,  I  spent  two  invaluable  stints
at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory solar observatory in Sunspot, New
Mexico engaged in cutting edge research with world-class instruments.

The  NASA  Space  Grant  program  in  Washington  State  is  a  positive  example.
NASA  funds  support  around  150  undergraduate  students  every  year  to  engage  in
STEM  research,  mentored  by  faculty  at  institutions  throughout  the  state,  intern-
ships at companies or NASA centers, or participation on student design teams. Last
year  100  percent  of  the  Space  Grant  scholar  graduates  went  on  to  STEM  graduate
work or employment. While the program keeps good statistics, it could benefit from
a more sophisticated evaluation effort.
3. How  does  the  lack  of  coordination  and  overarching  strategy  for  STEM  education

programs hinder the agencies from making an impact?
There is a huge inventory of poorly designed and under-evaluated mission-related
curricula  (posters  and  lesson  plans  and  associated  professional  development)  rarely
used  in  classrooms  and  with  no  natural  home  in  a  coherent  standards-based  cur-
riculum.  The  constant  barrage  of  new  ‘‘resources’’  adds  to  the  noise  in  the  system
and contributes to the ‘‘mile wide, inch deep’’ problem. Effective curriculum develop-
ment  requires  a  deep  collaboration  with  a  team  of  professional  curriculum  devel-
opers, education researchers, and classroom teachers.

In that light, I do have one positive example. I recently received a copy an astron-
omy curriculum for grades 3–5 that was developed collaboratively by NASA and the
professional  science  educators  and  developers  at  the  Lawrence  Hall  of  Science  and
UC–Berkeley.  It  is  high  quality  and  it  fills  a  real  need  for  instructional  materials
at  this  level.  A  collaborative  curriculum  development  model  such  as  this  is  rare.
Adding  a  rigorous  evaluation  component  to  explore  ho  well  the  curriculum  helps
teachers teach and students learn could make it exemplary.
Summary

A focus on 1) partnering with high schools and community colleges along with ap-
propriate  education  professionals  and  industry  partners  on  mission-related  tech-
nology  education  programs  for  the  future  technical  workforce,  and  2)  supporting
mission-related  research  for  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  both  in  agency
facilities and on university campuses could pay major dividends. This would require
an  achievable  overarching  strategy,  but  not  necessarily  significant  coordination
among  the  agencies.  The  critical  collaboration  would  be  with  STEM  education  pro-
fessionals (not just K–12 teachers), university faculty, and industry partners.

BIOGRAPHY FOR GEORGE D. NELSON

Dr.  George  D.  Nelson  is  the  Director  of  Science  Mathematics,  and  Technology
Education and Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Western Washington Univer-
sity  in  Bellingham,  Washington.  The  program  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of
future K–12 science, mathematics, and technology teachers. It is also a research and
development  center  with  a  focus  on  teacher  preparation  and  science,  mathematics,
and technology education reform. He is currently the principal investigator on a $12
million NSF project, the North Cascades and Olympic Science Partnership.

Prior to joining Western Washington University in 2002, Dr. Nelson was Director
of  Project  2061  and  a  member  of  the  senior  staff  of  the  American  Association  for
the Advancement of Science. Project 2061 is engaged in the reform of science, math-
ematics,  and  technology  education  at  all  levels  with  a  focus  on  helping  to  create  a
system  where  all  high  school  graduates  are  literate  in  science,  mathematics,  and
technology.  Under  Dr.  Nelson’s  leadership  Project  2061  produced  a  number  of
ground-breaking  publications  including  Blueprints  for  Reform,  Designs  for  Science
Literacy,  and  the  Atlas  of  Science  Literacy.  The  project  also  developed  unique  and
rigorous  procedures  for  evaluating  curriculum  materials  and  assessments,  and
greatly expanded its professional development activities.

From 1989 to 1996 Dr. Nelson was Associate Vice Provost for Research and Asso-
ciate  Professor  of  Astronomy  and  Education  at  the  University  of  Washington.  His
administrative  responsibilities  included  research  policy,  government-university-in-
dustry  interactions,  university-K–12  education  interactions,  and  federal  relations.

novative  seminar  on  science  education  for  scientists,  graduate  students,  and  teach-
ers  using  Project  2061  as  the  underlying  foundation.  During  the  1992–93  academic
year, Dr. Nelson was a fellow of the American Council on Education.

From  1978  to  1989  he  served  as  a  NASA  astronaut  and  flew  as  a  mission  spe-
cialist aboard three Space Shuttle flights. These missions included the first on-orbit
satellite  repair  in  1984.  Dr.  Nelson  was  the  pilot  of  the  first  operational  flight  of
the  manned  maneuvering  unit  and  the  primary  extra-vehicular  crewman.  He  also
served  on  the  crew  of  the  flight  of  Discovery  in  September  1989  immediately  fol-
lowing  the  loss  of  the  Challenger  and  was  extensively  involved  in  the  rework  of  all
crew  procedures  and  the  re-engineering  of  Space  Shuttle  components  and  software.
He  has  advised  NASA  through  service  on  a  number  of  committees,  most  recently
as  Chair  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  Servicing  Missions  3A  and  3B  External  Inde-
pendent Readiness Review Team.

B.S.  in  physics  from  Harvey  Mudd  College  and  M.S.  and  Ph.D.  in  astronomy  from
the University of Washington. His research interests include science education, edu-
cation reform, and radiative transfer and hydrodynamics applied to interesting prob-
lems in astrophysics.

He  lives  in  Bellingham  with  his  wife,  Susie.  They  have  two  grown  daughters;
Aimee  Nelson-Engle  and  Marti  Nelson-Frazier  and  three  perfect  grandsons,  Pierce,
Langston, and Andrew.

Chairman BAIRD. Thank you, Dr. Nelson. Mr. Van Reiner.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  VAN  R.  REINER,  PRESIDENT  AND  CEO,
MARYLAND  SCIENCE  CENTER,  MARYLAND  ACADEMY  OF
SCIENCES
Mr.  REINER.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the
Subcommittee. I am Van Reiner, President of the Maryland Science
Center  located  in  Baltimore’s  Inner  Harbor.  We  have  three  levels
of  interactive,  hands-on  exhibits,  a  planetarium,  an  IMAX  theater,
classroom  space,  and  a  program  space  for  live  science  demonstra-
tions.  Each  year  we  admit  100,000  students  attending  with  school
groups  to  augment  their  science  and  mathematics  curriculum.  We
are a member of the Association of Science Technology Centers, In-
corporated.

We,  like  hundreds  of  institutions  across  the  country,  employ
what  is  known  as  informal  education  as  a  way  to  connect  people
with science and technology. Learning by doing is the basis for our
approach. Showing how, rather than stating why, gives visitors the
information they need to make informed decisions about how to re-
late  the  topic  at  hand.  When  we  are  successful,  we  go  from  global
to local to individual by giving the facts, a better understanding of
the topic or how it relates to them, and hopefully a quest for more
knowledge.

Motivating students to take interest in science, technology, engi-
neering,  and  math,  whether  or  not  they  choose  to  pursue  a  career
in  those  fields,  puts  science  centers  in  a  unique  position  to  spark
an initial interest.

Collaborations are essential to the success of science centers, and
we  have  a  history  of  collaborating  with  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies. The longest running collaboration is with NASA. We have
co-hosted events with NASA such as having students participate in
televideo  conferences  with  the  astronauts  aboard  the  International
Space  Station  and  the  Shuttle,  as  well  as  watching  a  European
solar  eclipse  while  talking  to  NASA  Goddard  scientists  on  board  a

project  to  measure  the  amount  of  UV  radiation  that  reaches  the
earth at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor.

Scientists  from  federal  agencies  participate  in  our  ‘‘scientist  of
the month’’ program to interact directly with our visitors to discuss
current  research  findings.  Other  instances  with  NASA  and  other
agencies are listed in my written testimony.

Evaluation  of  these  programs  and  exhibits  have  been  performed
in  our  institution  by  us.  The  accepted  practice  for  informal  edu-
cation  institutions  such  as  ASTC  members  has  been  to  do  front-
end,  formative,  remedial,  and  summative  evaluations  of  the  pro-
gram or exhibit by a third party to be sure that stated goals of the
project  are  met.  These  evaluations  are  required  for  NSF  or  NIH
grants, and we use them for other federally sponsored exhibits and
programs.  Several  of  these  evaluations  are  included  in  the  attach-
ments  to  my  written  testimony,  and  I  apologize  for  the  length  of
them. [Evaluations included in Appendix 2: Additional Material for
the Record.]

These  evaluations  are  thorough  and  complete  and  help  us  to
know if we have met the requirements of the project and if the au-
dience understands the subject presented. We feel that without this
evaluation we would quickly lose our relevancy.

Currently  we  are  collaborating  with  NASA  and  NOAA  on  evalu-
ating a project called Science on a Sphere, the globe identical to the
one  that  Queen  Elizabeth  II  visited  at  Goddard  Space  Center  last
week.  We  have  been  asked  by  NOAA  to  lead  the  users  group  to
work  with  the  agencies  to  develop  evaluation  methods  specifically
for the exhibit as well as the programming that the group develops
around  the  exhibit.  This  collaboration  between  NOAA  and  NASA
is  unique  and  should  be  encouraged.  Scientists  from  the  two  agen-
cies are working together to ensure that the data presented is clear
and meaningful. Increased collaboration between federal R&D mis-
sion  agencies  and  science  centers  can  better  accomplish  the  goals
of  STEM  education  programs.  The  dialogue  between  federal  mis-
sion  agencies  should  be  expanded  so  that  the  general  public  and
students  can  be  presented  with  knowledge  in  larger  and  more
meaningful ways.

We  believe  that  greater  understanding  leads  to  greater  accept-
ance  that  science  is  resident  in  everything  we  do.  It  just  doesn’t
happen  in  a  laboratory.  Science  centers  are  a  resource  in  every
sense of the word and should be viewed as such. We know how visi-
tors react and how to best present scientific discovery and scientific
progress to the public. We believe greater utilization of science cen-
ters as resources for federal R&D mission agencies is the best way
to help raise the level of scientific literacy with the general public,
including students. We can, and do augment, the formal classroom
instruction  using  resources  that  would  be  either  too  expensive  or
too  impractical  for  the  classroom.  I  believe  that  federal  R&D  mis-
sion  agencies  should  be  required  to  allocate  a  portion  of  their  re-
sources  to  educate  the  public  as  is  now  required  by  the  National
Science Foundation.

I thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to your ques-

tions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VAN R. REINER

28

The  Maryland  Science  Center,  located  at  Baltimore’s  Inner  Harbor,  is  a  private
non-profit that had its genesis in 1797 as the Maryland Academy of Sciences, which
is still our parent organization. The current building was put in service in 1976 and
expanded  in  2004.  The  facility  houses  three  levels  of  highly  interactive,  hands-on
exhibits,  a  planetarium,  an  IMAX  Theater,  classroom  space,  and  program  space  for
live demonstrations on a variety of scientific phenomena.

Each year, Maryland Science Center welcomes over 400,000 visitors to our facility
with  about  100,000  students  visiting  with  school  groups  to  augment  their  science
and  mathematics  curriculum.  Major  areas  of  concentration—our  core  programming
areas—are  Earth  system  science,  space  and  aerospace  science,  health  sciences  and
the  human  body,  and  early  childhood  education.  All  of  the  permanent  exhibits  at
the Maryland Science Center were designed to be in concert with the Maryland De-
partment  of  Education  Science  Curriculum,  and  where  applicable,  under  the  influ-
ence  of  The  Benchmarks  for  Science  Literacy  published  by  the  American  Academy
for  the  Advancement  of  Science  as  part  of  Project  2061,  the  National  Science  Edu-
cation Standards prepared under the auspices of the National Research Council, and
the  Principles  and  Standards  for  School  Mathematics  from  the  National  Council  of
Teachers of Mathematics.

The  Maryland  Science  Center,  like  hundreds  of  institutions  across  the  country
and  around  the  world,  employ  what  is  known  in  the  field  as  ‘‘informal  education’’
as  its  means  of  connecting  people  with  science  and  technology.  Learning  by  doing
is  the  foundation  of  informal  education,  along  with  demonstrating  practical  exam-
ples.  Building  on  that  foundation,  the  role  of  the  science  center  as  distiller  and  in-
terpreter  of  the  latest  in  scientific  discovery  and  connecting  the  public,  especially
school children, to the everyday application of these advancements, is a key strategy
we  employ.  Showing  how,  rather  than  stating  why,  gives  visitors  the  information
they  need  to  make  informed  decisions  about  how  they  can  relate  to  the  topic  at
hand.  When  we’re  successful,  we  go  from  global  to  local  to  individual  along  a  con-
tinuum  giving  the  individual  the  facts,  a  better  understanding  or  how  it  relates  to
them, and hopefully, a quest for more knowledge. Science centers in particular have
an ability to affect change by engaging school children through their use of informal
education methods. Motivating students to take interest in science, technology, engi-
neering  and  math,  whether  or  not  they  choose  to  pursue  a  career  in  those  fields,
puts science centers in a unique position to spark an initial interest.

Collaboration  has  always  been  a  means  to  an  end  for  the  institution.  Seeking
partnerships to ensure that our exhibits and programs are the best they can be has
yielded  quality  educational  and  enjoyable  product  for  our  visitors.  The  Maryland
Science  Center  has  long  cultivated  a  history  of  working  with  the  National  Aero-
nautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA),  National  Oceanographic  and  Atmos-
pheric  Administration  (NOAA),  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology
(NIST),  as  well  as  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  and  the  National  Insti-
tutes of Health (NIH). Working with these agencies, and others, we develop perma-
nent  exhibits,  traveling  exhibits,  and  programs  designed  to  inform  and  educate  the
general public—from those school children to their parents and teachers—about not
only  the  basics  of  science,  math  and  technology,  but  also  the  latest  events  and  dis-
coveries in our core programming areas.

In our core exhibits we use high tech, multimedia update centers known as Links.
Each  Link  is  designed  to  offer  real  time  investigation  of  science  topics  in  the  news
that  are  appealing  to  mass  audiences.  When  something  happens  in  the  world  of
science  and  technology,  our  Link  areas  and  Link  staff  key  in  on  the  news  releases,
scientific  data,  and  information  resources  to  process  and  present  the  findings  in  a
relevant,  thought-provoking  manner.  Our  Links  are  designed  to  give  visitors  who
seek  cursory,  as  well  as  deeper  understanding  of  science  as  it  happens,  a  chance
to  speak  with  our  content  experts,  and  to  explore  areas  that  can  be  a  resource  for
the  quest  for  deeper  knowledge.  Maryland  Science  Center  currently  features  three
Links. TerraLink focuses on Earth system science, SpaceLink concentrates on space
and  aerospace  science  and  BodyLink  examines  health  sciences.  The  fabrication  and
design of these centers was accomplished with input from the aforementioned agen-
cies,  and  we  continue  to  interface  with  these  agencies  to  stay  on  top  of  current  re-
search.

In the SpaceLink update center, NASA has been a primary partner. The partner-
ship has taken many forms. With the Goddard Space Flight Center, we have helped
develop  an  after  school  astronomy  club  format.  The  results  can  be  seen  at
www.afterschoolastronomy.org.  This  site  is  a  resource  that  provides  information  for
students  with  an  interest  in  astronomy  and  put  the  information  to  use  in  practical

applications,  a  hallmark  of  informal  education.  We  have  also  co-hosted  individual
events with Goddard such as Sun-Earth Day, where educators from Goddard are at
the  Maryland  Science  Center  to  explain  that  we  live  in  the  atmosphere  of  a  star,
which  has  many  effects  on  our  planet.  We  are  part  of  a  larger  system  and  under-
standing  that  system  is  vital  to  other  scientific  endeavors  we  attempt  to  explain.
This  is  an  annual  event  where  visitors  engage  in  activities  and  receive  print  mate-
rials  to  take  with  them  that  allow  them  to  further  explore  the  topics  at  home.
Again, relevancy and real world examples—informal education in process.

Maryland Science Center and Goddard also co-hosted an Earth Explorer Institute
where  we  convened  25  informal  educators  representing  science  centers  and  muse-
ums  from  across  America  to  discuss  and  recommend  NASA  Earth  science  program-
ming for informal audiences. As an outgrowth of that, we are participating in a UV
Citizen  Science  project.  We  will  enlist  citizens  to  measure  the  amount  of  UV  radi-
ation that hits the Earth at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, enter the data into a nation-
wide database, and then participate in ongoing work to measure changes in UV ra-
diation  across  the  country.  People  are  exposed  to  scientific  equipment,  scientific
methods,  and  will  be  able  to  participate  in  a  nationwide  study.  They  also  gain  a
greater understanding of the implications of changing UV levels as it relates to their
everyday lives.

Maryland  Science  Center  makes  its  resources  available  to  provide  opportunities
for  students  to  witness  events  such  as  a  solar  eclipse.  In  August  of  1999,  a  group
of  students  observed  a  solar  eclipse  in  Europe  via  a  link  with  Goddard  scientists
on board a research vessel in the Black Sea. Students came to the Maryland Science
Center  to  learn  about  the  eclipse  and  participated  in  two  televideo  conferences  be-
fore and during the event to observe and ask questions.

In  partnership  with  the  Johnson  Space  Center,  Maryland  Science  Center  has
hosted Baltimore City School students for four live downlinks from the International
Space  Station  and  the  Space  Shuttle  since  2001.  Students  have  conversations  as
well  as  question  and  answer  sessions  with  the  astronauts  aboard  the  Station  and
the  Shuttle.  Prior  to  the  downlinks,  students  visited  the  Maryland  Science  Center
to  learn  about  the  specific  mission  and  prepare  questions  for  the  astronauts.  The
missions included the delivery of the Destiny component to the International Space
Station,  and  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  servicing  mission.  After  these  two  mis-
sions, the entire Shuttle astronaut crew involved in the downlink visited the Mary-
land  Science  Center  to  meet  with  the  students  who  participated  in  the  conference
and the general public. We were the first informal education institution to have this
opportunity, and mentored other museums on how to replicate the experience.

With  the  Space  Telescope  Science  Institute,  we  were  advisors  on  the  making  of
a  short  IMAX  film  entitled  ‘‘Hubble:  Galaxies  Across  Space  and  Time.’’  This  three-
minute  film  has  been  shown  in  over  a  dozen  IMAX  theaters  nationwide.  At  the
Maryland  Science  Center,  it  has  had  1,564  screenings  for  over  110,000  visitors.  We
have  also  developed  a  planetarium  show  to  explain  what  the  Hubble  has  allowed
us to see and how those images have helped to shape the way we view the universe
as well as increasing our knowledge of our place in the universe.

Through collaboration, the Maryland Science Center participates in other smaller
programs funded by NASA as part of a larger grant to another institution. We will
create  a  series  of  programs  and  events  highlighting  the  New  Horizons  mission  to
Pluto  and  the  Kuiper  Belt.  We  will  host  a  small  exhibit,  offer  a  teacher  workshop
and host a Pluto Family Science Night. Keying on the recent news and popular cul-
ture  references  to  Pluto’s  status  as  a  planet  or  not,  Maryland  Science  Center  will
present the latest Pluto information as part of a popular planetarium show ‘‘Planet
Trek.’’ In conjunction with the Howard Owens Science Center in the Prince George’s
County, Maryland school system, we are to develop a planetarium program on Pluto
and the New Horizons mission for distribution to school planetariums nationwide—
currently numbering in excess of 600.

In TerraLink, the Earth systems science update center, Maryland Science Center
has  partnered  with  NASA  and  NOAA  to  provide  ongoing  support  for  programming
including  visual  material  and  scientific  expertise.  NASA  and  NOAA  scientists  peri-
odically  visit  to  work  with  students  as  part  of  our  Scientist  of  the  Month  program
and  on  special  programming  days  such  as  Earth  Day.  Students  and  visitors  have
a chance to see science pursuits as both a vocational option and simply as a means
to  broaden  awareness  that  science,  technology,  engineering  and  math  is  not  a  nar-
row  cast  field  of  inquiry  and  exploration.  The  focus  of  this  program  is  to  provide
science  and  technology  careerists  as  role  models  for  students  as  well  as  being  able
to  offer  another  thread  for  visitors  and  students  to  seek  out  information  about  how
things  like  atmospheric  phenomena  occurs.  TerraLink  staff  and  the  Science  Person
of  the  Month  collaborate  to  present  topics  and  information  to  the  public  in  under-
standable terms.

Using  NASA  and  NOAA  data  and  visual  imagery,  as  well  as  utilizing  experts
from the agencies in the Science Person of the Month program currently defines the
extent of Maryland Science Center collaboration with the agencies named in this in-
quiry.  It  should  be  noted  however  that  prior  to  the  institution’s  recent  expansion
and broadening of its core competencies, the programmatic synergies between Mary-
land  Science  Center  and  these  agencies  was  limited  by  definition  of  scope  and  mis-
sion.

Currently BodyLink, the Maryland Science Center’s health sciences update center,
collaborates  and  partners  with  other  federal  agencies—primarily  NIH,  through  its
Science  Education  Partnership  Award  program—but  does  not  at  this  time  enjoy  a
relationship with the agencies named in this inquiry. However, topics like the stud-
ies  of  the  effects  on  the  human  body  of  extended  durations  of  time  spent  living  in
space are of interest to BodyLink staffers and Maryland Science Center and the op-
portunities to collaborate and deliver programming similar to that which is already
in  place  in  SpaceLink  and  TerraLink  are  currently  tracking  with  our  institutional
collaborative goals.

Beyond the Link areas of our core exhibits and programming, and in partnership
with NOAA, Maryland Science Center has embarked on an exciting project entitled
Science  On  a  Sphere  (SOS).  This  is  an  Earth  visualization  system  developed  by
NOAA  that  projects  a  wide  variety  of  data  sets  onto  a  large  sphere  to  create  dy-
namic global views of the entire Earth. Visitors observe hurricane development and
prediction, tectonic plate movement and earthquakes, sea surface temperatures and
their effect on global weather conditions, as well as observe global warming models
and the potential effect on the Earth. Science On a Sphere is now a permanent ex-
hibit at the Maryland Science Center. Having this technology also allows us to com-
pare  Earth  to  other  planets  and  NASA  data  sets  have  been  converted  to  show  the
Moon,  Mars,  Saturn  and  the  Sun  on  the  same  sphere.  We  have,  in  collaboration
with  NOAA  and  NASA,  developed  Maryland  Science  Center  staff-delivered,  visitor-
centered,  programs  as  well  as  produced  prerecorded  programs  that  explain  the  im-
ages being observed.

We  have  also  developed  traveling  exhibits.  NIST  was  instrumental  in  providing
technical  information  for  our  Titanic  Science  exhibit.  NIST  performed  analyses  of
rivets  from  the  Titanic  hull  that  were  found  at  the  wreck  site  to  determine  the
strength  level  of  the  rivets,  so  our  information  would  be  factual.  One  of  the  ques-
tions  surrounding  the  Titanic  disaster  was  whether  or  not  the  steel  used  to  make
the  rivets  was  of  poor  quality—and  if  that  might  explain  how  the  ‘‘watertight’’  fea-
tures  failed.  By  presenting  the  data  and  the  surrounding  conditions,  visitors  were
left  to  their  own  conclusions  as  to  how  the  rivets  might  have  contributed  to  the
Titanic’s end.

Although we were not asked to speak directly to our collaboration with other fed-
eral  agencies,  two  examples  of  Maryland  Science  Center  collaboration  with  the  Na-
tional Institutes of Health are funding and content expertise for a traveling exhibit
titled:  The  Changing  Faces  of  Women’s  Health  and  funding  and  content  expertise
for our permanent health sciences update center BodyLink.

With  the  exception  of  Science  On  a  Sphere,  the  evaluation  of  permanent  exhibits
has  been  done  by  the  Maryland  Science  Center.  The  accepted  practice  for  informal
education institutions, as exemplified by the Association of Science-Technology Cen-
ters, (ASTC), has been to include a front-end evaluation as part of any project. This
involves determining what the public knows about the subject through focus groups
and  questionnaires.  The  project  is  then  judged  as  to  what  is  feasible  to  build  and
install, and through prototyping of exhibit pieces, determining if the public will un-
derstand  the  idea  or  concept  presented  by  the  various  exhibit  pieces.  When  the
project  is  complete,  a  summative  evaluation  is  performed  to  see  if  the  stated  goals
of  the  project  have  been  met.  This  is  done  through  direct  observation  and  public
feedback  solicitation,  usually  by  an  independent  third  party.  If  there  are  changes
to be made with the project, a final, remedial evaluation is made to ensure that the
intended  knowledge  transfer  has  been  made.  (Attachment  B  and  Attachment  C  ac-
companying  this  testimony  illustrate  an  example  of  this  evaluation  process  which
we completed as part of our development of our permanent Earth science and dino-
saur  exhibit.  The  exhibit  was  produced  with  funding  and  content  support  from
NASA).[Located in Appendix 2: Additional Material for the Record.]

With  educational  programs,  the  process  is  similar.  Educators  are  solicited  for
areas  where  an  informal  experience  can  add  to  the  students’  understanding  of  the
subject  matter.  When  the  programs  are  developed  and  delivered,  feedback  is  given
directly by the educators who bring their students to the center for the educational
enrichment. These accepted evaluation procedures are required for National Science
Foundation  or  National  Institutes  of  Health  grants  and  have  been  used  by  science
museums for other federally-sponsored exhibits and programs.

Using  the  accepted  evaluation  practices  mentioned  above,  NOAA,  NASA  and  the
Science  On  a  Sphere  users  group  (made  up  of  all  centers  with  a  sphere  installed
as well as those centers where spheres are being installed), have embarked on spe-
cific evaluation methods for the exhibit as well as the programs centered around the
exhibit.  Each  funded  NOAA  project  contains  a  detailed  evaluation  plan.  NOAA
asked the Maryland Science Center to lead a discussion of all SOS users on the dif-
ferent  SOS  evaluation  methods  used  to  date  and  what  method  of  prototyping  and
evaluation will best help science museums develop understandable exhibits and pro-
grams for the target school group audiences and the general public.

Using  front  end  evaluation  (a  copy  of  the  full  evaluation  can  be  found  in  Attach-
ment  A;  see  Appendix  2:  Additional  Material  for  the  Record)  of  the  Science  On  a
Sphere exhibit—again conducted by third party evaluators—Maryland Science Cen-
ter  was  able  to  implement  and  utilize  the  SOS  exhibit  in  response  to  the  feedback
collected  during  the  evaluation  process.  In  our  case,  we  developed  specific  staff-led
programs to augment the SOS experience for our visitors. Overwhelmingly, the dis-
play  of  the  information  and  data,  the  quality  of  the  presentation,  overall  appeal  of
the technology, and understanding of the purpose of the exhibit was extremely posi-
tive.  Once  operational  at  Maryland  Science  Center  however,  our  exhibits  team  no-
ticed  that  when  the  SOS  exhibit  ran  in  auto-play  mode  using  ‘‘canned’’  presen-
tations,  and  no  staff  members  were  available  to  augment  the  presentation  and  an-
swer  questions  about  the  data  being  presented,  the  level  of  engagement  was  short
in  duration.  In  general,  when  the  SOS  exhibit  was  facilitated  by  Maryland  Science
Center  staffers,  questions  were  answered,  programming  could  be  paused  for  expla-
nation, and dwell time (time people spend at a specific exhibit) by visitors was very
long  in  duration.  When  the  SOS  exhibit  ran  in  auto-play  mode—meaning  the
canned  programs,  with  their  taped  narrative—the  dwell  time  for  visitors  was  far
shorter. Visitors could not fully comprehend the auto-play presentations and moved
on  to  other  exhibit  areas  more  quickly.  ‘‘Canned’’  programming  for  SOS,  absent  a
subject  expert  who  could  interpret  the  presentation  for  the  casual  enthusiast,  was
at  too  high  a  level.  Programmers  may  have  assumed  too  high  a  level  of  under-
standing  on  the  part  of  the  museum-goer  and  the  exhibit  was  losing  audience  as
the visitor became confused or could not fully understand the presentation.

In  response  to  this,  Maryland  Science  Center  exhibit  team  members  installed
interactive computer kiosks around the SOS exhibit that offered a more basic inter-
pretation  of  the  imagery  and  programming  being  presented  when  the  exhibit  is  in
auto-play  mode.  Visitors  can  glean  basic  understanding  of  the  programming’s  more
technical  aspects  by  viewing  a  more  basic  interpretation  on  the  interactive  kiosk
screen.  Given  this  more  basic  knowledge,  the  visitor  is  given  the  tools  necessary  to
gain  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  original  intent  of  the  more  specialized  canned
programming.  Program  staff  have  also  inserted  more  facilitated  programs  into  the
presentation schedule to engage more visitors more often using the SOS exhibit. To
evaluate  and  measure  the  success  of  the  remedial  actions  the  exhibit  team  com-
pleted  a  dwell  time  study  of  visitor  interaction  with  the  SOS  exhibit  prior  to  the
installation of the interactive kiosks to create benchmark dwell time statistics. Now
that the kiosks are in place, the dwell time study will be repeated and the data will
be compared to the benchmarks created prior to the kiosk’s arrival. All the informa-
tion gathered, the remedial actions employed, and the measures of success are being
shared  and  reported  to  the  NASA/NOAA  led  SOS  users  group  so  that  the  exhibit
is  as  successful  as  possible  at  all  locations  around  the  country.  As  the  installation
of SOS exhibits began their roll out, greater collaboration between program creators
and  informal  educators  earlier  on  could  have  led  to  programs  that  did  not  need  as
much  remedial  modifications  and  augmentation.  Partnering  in  the  development
stage  may  have  gained  SOS  more  audience  and  enthusiasm  more  quickly  and  in
greater numbers.

The  case  with  SOS  illustrates  an  example  of  how  to  improve  scientific  literacy.
To  improve  the  effectiveness  of  using  informal  education  to  help  raise  the  level  of
scientific  literacy  in  the  United  States,  emphasis  should  be  placed  upon  how  non-
classified  information  could  be  made  available  to  the  general  public.  Informal  edu-
cators  such  as  ASTC  members  have  the  ability  to  dispense  highly  technical  knowl-
edge  in  a  manner  that  the  non-scientific  public  can  understand.  In  the  case  of  the
Maryland  Science  Center,  we  employ  a  cadre  of  on-the-floor  explainers,  many  of
whom have received training from the various federal R&D mission agencies to aug-
ment  their  own  formal  education.  For  every  hour  that  we  are  open,  we  have  staff
members ready to engage our visitors to answer questions or offer ideas that stimu-
late  meaningful  discussions  about  the  subject  areas.  Our  goal  is  to  make  gaining
this  knowledge  engaging  and  fun,  while  showing  how  science  and  technology  affect
our  daily  lives.  In  the  process,  our  hope  is  that  we  will  excite  and  encourage  some
of our student visitors to consider careers in science and technology.

In the example provided about the installation, evaluation, and ongoing collabora-
tion with the Science On a Sphere exhibit there is a working example of how federal
agencies  and  science  centers  can  better  accomplish  the  goals  of  STEM  education
programs. We would encourage federal agencies to continue to expand ways that re-
searchers and engineers collaborate with informal science education professionals to
better engage the public. With SOS, scientists were made available to us, evaluation
was encouraged, and NASA and NOAA sought our help in getting the message out.
There was recognition that science centers, through their use of informal education,
know how to engage visitors and spark their interest in the sciences. We know how
visitors  react  and  how  best  to  present  scientific  discovery  and  scientific  progress.
And we know how to present it in ways that matter to them as individuals.

The  dialogue  with  science  centers  should  be  expanded—we  want  access  to  the
knowledge  and  the  discovery  so  we  can  distill,  interpret  and  present  it  to  the  gen-
eral  public  and  school  children  in  larger  and  more  meaningful  ways.  We  want  to
reach  greater  numbers  of  people  more  often  so  that  scientific  discovery  becomes  as
much a part of a person’s everyday life as it can be. We believe that greater under-
standing  leads  to  greater  acceptance  that  science  is  resident  in  everything  we  do—
it  doesn’t  just  happen  in  a  laboratory.  Science  centers  like  the  Maryland  Science
Center are a resource in every sense of the word and deserve to be viewed as such—
from  resources  (financial  and  otherwise)  to  expertise  and  knowledge.  We  believe
greater  utilization  of  science  centers  as  resources  for  federal  R&D  mission  agencies
is the best way help raise the level of scientific literacy with the general public, in-
cluding school children.

STATEMENT OF DR. IRIS R. WEISS, PRESIDENT, HORIZON

RESEARCH, INC.

Dr.  WEISS.  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank

you for the opportunity to participate in this hearing.

My  name  is  Iris  Weiss,  and  I  have  spent  the  last  three  decades
in  research  and  evaluation  in  STEM  education.  I  would  like  to
share my thoughts on two issues, the first is how program evalua-
tion  can  help  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  be  more  efficient
and effective wherever they choose to focus their efforts to increase
scientific literacy, and the second is where I believe these agencies
should focus their efforts.

To  date  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  have  not  had  a  great
deal  of  success  in  evaluating  their  STEM  education  programs.  The
same  can  be  said  for  other  federal  agencies  and  for  the  broader
field as well.

How  could  evaluations  be  improved?  First,  the  designs  of  pro-
posed  programs  should  be  critiqued  to  determine  if  the  interven-
tions  are  likely  to  lead  to  the  desired  outcomes  and  how  broad  the
impact  would  likely  be,  so  programs  could  be  improved  before
major  costs  are  incurred.  To  take  one  example,  the  Department  of
Energy  offered  science  teachers  summer  employment  in  their  re-
search  labs.  Program  goals  include  deepening  participating  teach-
ers’ knowledge of science and improving classroom practice at their
schools.  But  a  design  critique  would  suggest  that  the  program
would be unlikely to achieve its classroom impact goal. Few teach-
ers  would  have  the  time  and  expertise  needed  to  develop  student
activities that were accurate, developmentally appropriate, and fea-
sible  to  implement  with  the  resources  likely  to  be  available,  nor
would the participating teachers be likely to have the time to help
other  teachers  improve  their  classroom  practice.  A  design  critique
might  well  have  predicted  what  in  fact  happened.  Teachers  appre-
ciated  being  involved  in  the  program,  reported  that  it  deepened
their understanding of scientific content and scientific research, but
it did not have much of an impact on classroom practice.

Similarly,  formative  evaluation  of  pilot  programs  would  help  the
agencies be more efficient and effective in their STEM education ef-
forts.  At  the  pilot  stage,  the  focus  is  not  on  impact  but  rather  on
whether  the  program  can  be  implemented  as  intended,  how  it
might be improved, or if it needs to be discontinued.

There is no question that impact evaluations need to be improved
as well, as the just-released report of the ACC makes clear. At the
same time I believe the challenges associated with rigorous evalua-
tions  of  education  programs  have  not  been  adequately  acknowl-
edged  in  that  report.  In  addition,  effective  evaluations  require  not
only  strong  research  design  but  also  appropriate  outcome  meas-
ures.  Although  developing  instruments  to  assess  teacher  content
knowledge and similar goals is not the responsibility of the federal
R&D mission agencies, I believe that the lack of appropriate meas-
ures  will  continue  to  hamper  the  mission  agencies  in  efforts  to  in-
crease their program effectiveness.

Where  should  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  focus  their  ef-
forts  to  improve  scientific  literacy?  Based  on  my  understanding  of
the complexities of the K–12 education system and the expertise of
these agencies, I believe they should play a relatively small role in

34

efforts  to  improve  the  formal  K–12  education  system  and  a  larger
role  in  the  informal  science  arena.  For  example,  current  evidence
suggests that teacher professional development is most effective in
improving  classroom  practice  when  it  is  closely  tied  to  instruction.
We know that teacher content knowledge is necessary, but it is be-
coming  increasingly  clear  that  it  is  not  sufficient.  Teachers  also
need to learn how to use their instructional materials well, how to
figure  out  what  their  students  understand  and  where  they  are
struggling,  and  how  to  make  appropriate  instructional  decisions
based  on  that  information.  And  teachers  need  opportunities  to
apply  what  they  are  learning  in  their  own  classrooms  and  to  get
constructive  feedback.  The  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  certainly
have the content expertise to provide professional development, but
they  have  only  limited  understanding  of  K–12  education  and  they
are  not  well-positioned  to  provide  professional  development  that  is
practice-oriented and sustained over time. For greater and broader
impact,  rather  than  developing  their  own  programs,  I  believe  the
federal  R&D  mission  agencies  should  consider  making  scientists
available  to  serve  as  content  resources  for  local  professional  devel-
opment,  helping  shore  up  a  major  weakness  of  many  of  those  pro-
grams.

In  contrast,  I  believe  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  are  very
well-positioned  to  make  major  contributions  in  the  informal  edu-
cation arena along the lines we have just heard. Lack of coherence
is  not  a  problem  here,  as  it  is  when  we  talked  about  curriculum
development.  In  fact,  having  multiple  pathways  increases  the  like-
lihood that a large number of people will benefit from the available
resources.

Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Weiss follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF IRIS R. WEISS

I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the Research and Science Education
Subcommittee  as  it  explores  how  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  can  contribute
to  improved  scientific  literacy  for  all  students.  There  is  no  question  that  there  is  a
wealth  of  scientific  expertise  in  the  various  agencies,  and  considerable  interest  in
helping to improve K–12 STEM education. Moreover, much of the work of these mis-
sion agencies focuses on areas that are of intrinsic interest to students, and can help
motivate students both to engage in learning science and to consider STEM careers.
With  appropriate  programs,  carefully  designed  and  well-implemented,  the  federal
R&D mission agencies can both enhance levels of scientific literacy in the population
as a whole and help ensure an adequate supply of well-qualified STEM professionals
for the future.

It is important to recognize, however, that there are many more ‘‘good ideas’’ (i.e.,
possible programs in areas of relevance to the agency’s mission that have the poten-
tial to increase teacher knowledge, improve classroom practice, and enhance student
knowledge  and  aspirations)  than  can  possibly  be  implemented.  There  are  substan-
tial  costs  involved  in  designing,  implementing,  and  evaluating  new  programs,  and
very limited resources available for these activities. Clearly there need to be criteria
for  deciding  which  of  the  many  potentially  good  ideas  should  be  implemented  by  a
particular  agency,  and  processes  for  deciding  how  to  refine  promising  programs,
which ones to scale up, and which ones to drop.

The hearing charter makes clear that the goal is to increase the level of scientific
literacy for all students. It is important, therefore, to consider the nature and scope
of  the  K–12  education  system  that  the  mission  agencies  are  trying  to  influence—
50 states, more than 15,000 school districts, more than 100,000 schools, and millions
of  teachers  responsible  for  STEM  education,  textbook  publishers,  test  developers,
etc.  all  making  decisions  that  affect  student  opportunities  to  become  scientifically
literate.  In  addition,  while  there  have  been  efforts  to  identify  the  core  under-
standings  that  constitute  scientific  literacy,  the  volume  of  content  included  in  na-

tional  and  State  standards  documents  is  still  much  more  than  can  possibly  be  ad-
dressed  in  depth  in  the  time  available.  Teachers  and  curriculum  developers  are
faced with the unenviable choice of trying to cover it all, and doing so superficially;
or  taking  seriously  the  recommendation  for  in-depth,  inquiry-based  learning,  and
leaving out some of the required content.

In  this  context,  current  and  potential  programs  have  to  be  examined  not  only  to
see  if  they  are  effective  in  terms  of  adding  value  to  the  participating  teachers/stu-
dents,  but  also  whether  there  are  likely  to  be  sufficient  indirect  benefits  to  a  large
enough number of students to make a meaningful difference in overall scientific lit-
eracy.  At  present,  the  problem  I  see  with  many  federal  programs,  including  those
of  the  R&D  mission  agencies,  is  that  they  have  very  limited  potential  for  leverage
and in some cases simply add to the confusion.
How  can  program  evaluation  help  federal  programs  be  more  efficient  and
effective in improving STEM education?

The federal R&D mission agencies have not had a great deal of success in evalu-
ating their STEM education programs; the same can be said for other federal agen-
cies,  and  for  the  broader  field  as  well.  The  natural  desire  to  address  the  pressing
problems  in  science  education  has  taken  precedence  over  the  need  to  ensure  that
the  investments  will  in  fact  have  the  intended  impact.  I  believe  that  existing  pro-
gram  evaluation  tools  and  approaches  can  help  increase  the  likelihood  that  STEM
education  programs  supported  by  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  (and  others  as
well) will have a broad, positive impact.

Evaluation  is  useful  at  various  stages  of  a  program.  It  can  and  should  be  used
in (1) critiquing proposed programs to help make decisions about which ones to offer
and  to  improve  their  designs;  (2)  monitoring  program  quality  both  to  allow  appro-
priate  mid-course  corrections  and  determine  if  the  program  is  ready  for  rigorous
evaluation;  and  (3)  assessing  program  impact.  At  present,  it  appears  that  some  of
the  tools  and  approaches  that  evaluation  has  to  offer  are  used  some  of  the  time  in
some of the STEM education programs supported by the federal R&D mission agen-
cies;  their  more  consistent  application  would  help  improve  the  quality,  impact,  and
cost-effectiveness of the agencies’ efforts to enhance overall scientific literacy.
Evaluation as design critique

In terms of program design, the first step any agency needs to take is to identify
needs  relevant  to  their  mission  and  expertise.  The  federal  R&D  mission  agencies
have  been  very  successful  in  this  regard;  virtually  every  program  they  offer  can  be
readily mapped both to the mission of the agency and to the needs of the designated
target audience(s).

But  targeting  an  appropriate  need  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  the  programs
are  addressing  priority  needs;  one  can  assume  that  at  least  some  students  and
teachers lack knowledge in any given area of science, and that many more students
and  teachers  are  likely  to  lack  knowledge  in  areas  at  the  cutting  edge  of  science.
Since any program aimed at increasing teacher or student knowledge could be justi-
fied  by  making  the  case  that  it  addresses  an  existing  need,  simply  being  able  to
demonstrate need is not an adequate criterion for making decisions among potential
programs.  Given  scarce  resources,  agencies  need  to  be  able  to  decide  which  of  the
many  needs  that  are  consistent  with  their  mission  are  the  most  important  to  ad-
dress,  and  which  of  those  they  have  the  capacity  to  address  well.  Only  then  does
it make sense to move ahead with program development.

Not  having  been  part  of  the  program  planning  discussions,  I  can’t  tell  the  extent
to  which  the  mission  agencies’  STEM  education  program  rationales  were  made  ex-
plicit  and  the  various  priorities  debated.  But  my  impression  from  the  multitude  of
topics, grade ranges, and approaches the various agencies are using is that decisions
have  been  made  based  on  whether  a  particular  idea  was  of  interest  to  someone  in
a decision-making position, rather than whether the program was part of an overall,
coordinated strategy for maximum leverage on K–12 education.

Even more important than whether a program targets a priority need is whether
the proposed intervention is likely to have the desired impact; no matter how impor-
tant  the  need,  ineffective  programs  are  a  wasted  investment.  Conducting  a  ‘‘design
critique’’ of a proposed program can help improve the design, or in some cases lead
to  a  decision  not  to  go  forward  with  programs  where  the  odds  are  stacked  against
them.  And  the  very  good  news  is  that  design  critiques  are  not  an  expensive  under-
taking; they require only modest amounts of time from people who understand both
the  system  that  is  being  targeted  for  improvement  and  what  has  been  learned  in
prior efforts.

We  need  to  pay  more  attention  to  the  fact  that  STEM  education  programs  that
either have little likelihood of impact, or will impact only a small number of teach-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:21 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

36

ers/students, are not going to make much of a difference in overall scientific literacy.
Again,  the  criterion  of  likely  impact  based  on  prior  research  and  the  ‘‘wisdom  of
practice’’  seems  not  to  have  been  uniformly  applied  in  the  STEM  education  pro-
grams offered by the federal R&D mission agencies.

To  take  one  example,  the  Department  of  Energy  has  at  various  times  offered
science  teachers  summer  employment  in  their  research  labs,  an  expensive  under-
taking  given  the  costs  of  salary,  transportation,  and  lodging.  The  goals  of  the  pro-
gram  have  been  to  deepen  participating  teachers’  knowledge  of  science,  and  to  im-
prove  instruction  not  only  in  the  participating  teachers’  classrooms,  but  in  those  of
their colleagues at the school as well.

Developing a ‘‘logic model,’’ a standard tool in program evaluation, would have en-
abled  the  designers  of  that  program  to  see  that  there  were  major  holes  in  the  pro-
gram’s  theory  of  action,  places  where  the  links  between  activity  and  impact  were
weak  at  best.  One  could  readily  make  the  case  that  teachers  would  learn  more
science, and learn more about scientific research, by being placed in a research lab-
oratory.  However,  the  science  content  teachers  were  learning  was  likely  to  be  well
beyond  what  their  students  would  be  expected  to  learn,  and  they  would  not  have
the  sophisticated  equipment  needed  to  carry  out  the  investigations.  Few  teachers
would have the time and expertise needed to develop instructional activities to make
the  activities  developmentally  appropriate  for  their  students  and  feasible  to  imple-
ment  with  the  available  resources;  nor  would  participating  teachers  have  the  time
to  help  other  teachers  apply  what  they  had  learned.  Thus,  while  teachers  who  par-
ticipate  in  these  kinds  of  programs  often  report  that  they  gained  a  great  deal  from
these  experiences,  it  should  not  be  surprising  that  the  improved  classroom  practice
that  was  a  major  goal  of  the  programs  rarely  materialized.  In  this  case  and  many
others  supported  by  federal,  state,  and  local  agencies,  considerable  resources  have
been devoted to programs where lack of classroom-level impact could have been an-
ticipated.
Formative evaluation to enable mid-course corrections and determine if programs are

ready for rigorous evaluation

Given  the  start-up  costs  associated  with  the  development  of  any  new  program,  it
make  sense  to  fund  only  those  that  have  great  potential  to  begin  with,  and  then
based  on  the  lessons  learned  during  implementation  to  refine  the  programs  to  get
the kinks out. Evaluations of the mission agencies’ STEM education programs would
also be improved by more systematic attention to monitoring the quality of program
implementation and use of the resulting feedback.

From  an  external  perspective,  the  fact  that  some  initiatives  have  been  modified
over  time  suggests  that  at  least  some  of  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  employ
formative evaluation strategies for at least some of their STEM education programs.
It  is  less  clear  whether  the  STEM  education  programs  supported  by  the  federal
R&D  mission  agencies  use  evaluation  for  quality  control  purposes  when  programs
are expanded. Often the people who design a program, e.g., for teacher professional
development,  are  able  to  implement  it  well,  but  when  the  program  is  expanded  the
quality tends to suffer. It is important both to monitor initial program implementa-
tion and fine-tune the design as needed, and to monitor the quality of implementa-
tion during scale up. Ideally, evaluations of the quality of implementation would in-
clude  observations  of  program  activities  by  people  who  have  expertise  in  both  con-
tent  and  the  target  populations;  interviews  with  key  stakeholders,  including  in
many  cases  students,  teachers,  administrators,  and  parents.  Often  it  is  appropriate
to  collect  some  interim  data  on  impact  to  see  if  the  design  needs  to  be  fine-tuned,
or additional support provided to program implementers.

Sometimes a preliminary evaluation provides evidence that a program is unlikely
to  achieve  its  goals,  so  a  more  rigorous  evaluation  is  not  necessary.  For  example,
my organization was once asked to evaluate a statewide program that had the goal
of  ‘‘transforming  elementary  science  education.’’  One  of  the  primary  interventions
was  having  STEM  faculty  visit  classrooms—typically  once  a  semester—and  model
for  teachers  how  to  conduct  science  demonstrations.  The  client  wanted  evidence  to
see  if  this  strategy  was  paying  off  in  terms  of  improved  classroom  practice.  Recog-
nizing  the  limitations  of  survey  self-report  data,  they  asked  that  we  do  classroom
observations, which would have required site visits to a fairly large number of treat-
ment and comparison classes, clearly an expensive undertaking.

From our perspective, finding out that something that could not possibly work in
fact  did  not  work  seemed  to  us  to  be  a  poor  use  of  both  our  time  and  taxpayer
money; we convinced the client to let us interview a small number of teachers before
committing  to  a  more  extensive  evaluation.  Teachers  told  us  that  (1)  they  were
happy  to  have  scientists  visit  their  classrooms  because  the  kids  enjoyed  it  and  got
a  better  sense  that  scientists  were  like  most  people,  not  nerdy  beings  in  laboratory

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:21 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

coats;  (2)  they  thought  it  would  be  a  good  idea  if  they  did  demonstrations  like  the
scientists  had  done,  but  acknowledged  that  they  rarely  did  so—they  didn’t  know
whether the demonstrations would ‘‘work;’’ they didn’t have the necessary materials;
and  they  were  concerned  that  they  wouldn’t  be  able  to  answer  questions  students
raised.  In  this  case  we  were  able  to  convince  the  client  to  forego  a  rigorous  evalua-
tion, but not, unfortunately, to revamp the clearly ineffective program.

As  another  example,  if  materials  have  been  developed  for  classroom  use,  but  ini-
tial  evaluation  data  show  that  teachers  aren’t  using  the  materials  because  of  they
do  not  appear  to  be  well-aligned  with  state  standards,  time  and  effort  spent  doing
a  careful  evaluation  of  impact  on  student  learning  would  not  be  warranted.  Given
the  substantial  costs  involved,  only  programs  that  have  a  reasonable  likelihood  of
substantial  impact  and  can  be  implemented  well  should  be  subjected  to  rigorous
evaluation.

It is particularly important to provide incentives for agency personnel to use eval-
uation  feedback  for  program  improvement,  rather  than  allowing  people  to  continue
to  implement  poorly  designed,  inadequately  implemented,  or  ineffective  programs.
Unfortunately,  there  appear  to  be  pressures  at  every  level  of  the  system  for  people
to overstate the success of their programs, highlighting positive aspects and glossing
over  problems,  which  may  help  explain  the  observation  that  almost  everything  ap-
pears to work, but nothing much changes.
Summative evaluation to assess program impact

What most people mean by program evaluation has nothing to do with design cri-
tique  or  studying  the  quality  of  implementation;  rather  evaluation  is  typically
equated with an assessment of the impact of a particular activity or set of activities.
It is important to recognize that rigorous evaluation is very difficult, and it is there-
fore  not  surprising  that  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  have  encountered  many
challenges  in  assessing  the  impact  of  their  STEM  education  programs.  First,  as  a
profession,  we  lack  instruments  to  measure  many  of  the  outcomes  we  care  about.
For  example,  many  STEM  education  programs  over  the  last  several  decades  have
aimed to deepen teacher content knowledge, but until recently there were no instru-
ments  of  demonstrated  validity  and  reliability  that  were  feasible  for  use  on  a  large
scale;  even  now  such  instruments  exist  for  only  a  few  topics.  As  a  result,  program
evaluations  have  had  to  depend  on  notoriously  suspect  measures,  such  as  asking
teachers if they thought their content knowledge had improved! Programs targeting
student knowledge have faced similar problems, as it has proven difficult and costly
to  develop  measures  of  conceptual  understanding;  existing  instruments  are  more
likely  to  assess  student  knowledge  of  vocabulary  or  the  apocryphal  n  steps  in  the
‘‘scientific  method,’’  rather  than  the  in-depth  understanding  sought  by  STEM  edu-
cation programs.

Even if appropriate measures were available, program evaluation has to navigate
many other difficult challenges as well. Much attention has been paid of late to ran-
domized  field  trials  as  the  ‘‘gold  standard’’  for  evaluating  program  effectiveness.
There is no question about the value of this approach, but there are many questions
about  its  cost  and  feasibility.  (It  is  particularly  ironic  that  at  a  time  when  school
districts are very interested in ‘‘research-based’’ programs, they are reluctant to par-
ticipate in research because of the many pressures they are dealing with.)

And  as  the  recent  report  by  the  American  Competitive  Council  notes,  decisions
about  education  policy  and  practice  shouldn’t  be  based  on  single  studies,  however
well-designed. To be most helpful, an evaluation of program effectiveness should in-
clude  multiple  studies  to  answer  question  not  only  about  whether  the  program
achieves  its  desired  outcomes,  but  also  with  whom  and  under  what  conditions.  Fi-
nally,  summative  evaluations  need  to  determine  if  programs  have  had  unintended
negative consequences.
Where  should  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  focus  their  STEM  edu-
cation efforts?

Based  on  my  understanding  of  both  the  expertise  of  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies,  and  the  complexities  of  the  K–12  education  system,  I  believe  these  agen-
cies  should  play  a  relatively  small,  supporting  role  in  efforts  to  improve  the  K–12
education  system,  and  a  more  direct  and  major  role  in  the  informal  science  arena.
I  suspect  that  was  not  the  advice  I  was  expected  to  provide,  as  I  was  asked  to
use what we have learned from research to make recommendations for the develop-
ment  of  programs  for  pre-service  and  in-service  STEM  teachers.  (Before  I  explain
my  reasoning,  I  would  like  to  point  out  that  the  research  I  and  others  have  con-
ducted on effective professional development has not progressed as far as one would
hope,  for  a  myriad  of  reasons.  I  already  mentioned  the  lack  of  valid  and  reliable
measures of teacher learning that are feasible for large-scale administration. In my

view, it is both appropriate and essential that the Federal Government support such
development efforts, as the private sector has few if any incentives to undertake this
difficult  and  expensive  work.  But  that  is  probably  an  appropriate  task  for  the  Na-
tional  Science  Foundation  rather  than  for  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  that
are  under  consideration  in  this  hearing.  A  second  major  problem  has  been  the  lack
of a system to help ensure the steady accumulation of knowledge in key areas such
as  professional  development  for  STEM  teachers,  again  a  challenge  more  for  NSF
than for the federal R&D mission agencies. Much of what we ‘‘know’’ about effective
professional  development  is  based  on  the  insights  of  expert  practitioners,  rather
than  on  clear  empirical  evidence.  Richard  Elmore  has  characterized  the  emerging
consensus not as a substitute for research, but as a set of sensible propositions that
can be used to guide practice and as hypotheses to be tested.)

Although  the  research  is  far  from  definitive,  the  emerging  consensus  in  the  field
is  that  professional  development  is  most  effective  in  changing  classroom  practice
when  it  is  closely  tied  to  classroom  instruction.  Although  there  is  no  question  that
teacher content knowledge is necessary, it is becoming increasingly clear that teach-
er  knowledge  of  content  is  not  sufficient.  Teachers  also  need  to  learn  how  their  in-
structional  materials  can  be  used  to  help  students  learn  science  concepts;  how  to
figure  out  what  their  students  understand  and  where  they  are  struggling;  and  how
to appropriate instructional decisions based on that information. Teachers also need
opportunities  to  apply  what  they  are  learning  in  their  own  classrooms;  to  share
their struggles and triumphs with other teachers; and to get feedback they can use
in  improving  their  instruction.  To  be  effective,  it  appears,  professional  development
programs need to be intensive, extensive, and sustained over time.

The  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  clearly  have  the  necessary  content  expertise,
but  they  have  only  limited  expertise  in  improving  classroom  practice.  Thus  they  do
not  appear  to  be  well-positioned  to  make  a  substantial  contribution  to  teacher  pro-
fessional development of the nature and scale needed to increase overall science lit-
eracy. A number of the federal R&D agencies have offered professional programs for
many  years,  but  those  programs  typically  reach  only  small  numbers  of  teachers,  in
many  cases  ‘‘volunteers’’  who  tend  to  be  already  relatively  strong  in  content  knowl-
edge.  To  be  effective  in  providing  professional  development,  the  mission  agencies
would  need  to  create  mechanisms  to  be  able  to  stay  current  about  what  is  being
learned about effective professional development, and apply that knowledge to their
professional  development  programs.  And  they  would  have  to  develop  and  maintain
on-going  relationships  with  a  sufficient  number  of  districts  to  make  much  of  a  dif-
ference.

In  my  view,  rather  than  having  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  develop  and
implement  their  own  professional  development  programs,  it  would  make  sense  to
have  agency  scientists  available  to  serve  as  content  resources  for  local  professional
development.  It  would  also  be  helpful  if  agency  scientists  were  available  to  assist
organizations engaged in the development of professional development materials for
more widespread use.

Similarly,  I  would  not  recommend  that  the  mission  agencies  continue  to  develop
instructional  modules  for  classroom  use.  That  is  not  to  say  that  the  materials  the
federal  R&D  agencies  have  developed  are  of  poor  quality,  but  rather  that  the  K–
12  education  system  lacks  incentives  for  teachers  to  find  those  materials,  or  once
found,  to  use  them  in  their  classrooms.  Many  science  teachers  are  already  hard-
pressed to address the content included in state standards in anywhere close to the
depth  needed  to  develop  student  understanding,  so  adding  in  supplemental  activi-
ties  may  be  a  difficult  sell.  In  fact,  having  the  mission  agencies  provide  activities
for  classroom  use  can  actually  have  a  negative  effect,  adding  to  the  incoherence  in
the  system  as  different  teachers  make  different  decisions  about  what  to  leave  out
in order to make room for these activities. The teacher of the next course may well
have some students who have engaged with the topic as addressed in the ‘‘regular’’
materials,  some  with  the  supplemental  activity,  others  with  both,  and  still  others
with  neither.  In  that  situation,  teachers  can’t  win  no  matter  what  they  decide  to
do.

Just  as  serving  as  content  resources  for  others  engaged  in  professional  develop-
ment  would  be  helpful,  in  my  opinion  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  can  con-
tribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  K–12  education  system  by  making  relevant  data
accessible  to  people  who  develop  curricula,  assisting  them  in  understanding  their
potential  not  only  for  engaging  students  but  also  for  helping  them  learn  important
content as outlined in national and State standards.

In  contrast  to  the  cautious  approach  I  recommend  for  involvement  in  the  formal
K–12  education  system,  I  believe  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  are  well  posi-
tioned  to  make  major  contributions  in  the  informal  science  arena,  e.g.,  through  the
development  of  interactive  exhibits  for  science  centers  on  phenomena  of  interest  to

39

students,  parents,  and  the  general  public;  speakers’  bureaus;  activities  for  after-
school programs; newspaper inserts; television programs, etc.

Informal  science  education  vehicles  can  also  be  used  by  the  mission  agencies  to
help  ensure  an  adequate  science  pipeline,  for  example  disseminating  information
about  science  career  opportunities  requiring  different  levels  of  education.  The  fed-
eral R&D mission agencies can sponsor programs for interested students to interact
with  scientists,  with  special  efforts  to  encourage  participation  of  students  from
under-represented  groups.  Other  efforts  could  target  parents,  to  help  ensure  that
their  children  keep  their  options  open  by  enrolling  in  elective  mathematics  and
science courses.

While  coordination  of  efforts  among  agencies  to  avoid  unnecessary  duplication  of
either  infrastructure  or  resources  is  appropriate,  lack  of  coherence  is  not  an  issue
as  it  is  in  the  formal  K–12  education  system.  Different  people  will  access  different
resources  in  different  ways  and  at  different  times;  having  multiple  pathways  in-
creases the likelihood that people will benefit from the available resources.

BIOGRAPHY FOR IRIS R. WEISS

Iris  R.  Weiss  is  President  of  Horizon  Research,  Inc.  (HRI),  a  contract  research
firm in Chapel Hill, NC specializing in mathematics and science education research
and evaluation. She has had extensive experience in survey design and analysis and
in mathematics and science education development, evaluation, and policy research.
Dr.  Weiss  received  a  Bachelor’s  Degree  in  Biology  from  Cornell  University,  a  Mas-
ter’s  Degree  in  Science  Education  from  Harvard  University,  and  a  Ph.D.  in  Cur-
riculum  and  Instruction  from  the  University  of  North  Carolina  at  Chapel  Hill.  Be-
fore establishing HRI in 1987, Dr. Weiss was Senior Educational Research Scientist
at  the  Research  Triangle  Institute,  where  she  directed  numerous  education  re-
search,  development,  and  evaluation  projects.  Prior  to  that,  she  taught  science  at
the high school level in Ithaca, NY, and Chapel Hill, NC.

Dr.  Weiss  has  directed  many  of  HRI’s  research,  development,  and  evaluation
projects  and  is  responsible  for  quality  control  of  all  operations.  She  participated  in
the evaluation of NSF’s model middle school mathematics and science teacher prep-
aration  and  Triad  curriculum  programs,  served  on  the  assessment  working  group
for the National Standards of Science Education, and chaired the National Research
Council’s  Committee  on  Understanding  the  Influence  of  National  Standards.  Dr.
Weiss  has  served  on  numerous  advisory  boards,  and  has  provided  consultation  to
the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  US  Department  of  Education,  the  American
Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Science Teachers Associa-
tion,  the  National  Council  of  Teachers  of  Mathematics,  the  Congressional  Office  of
Technology Assessment, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, and several private foundations.

In  addition  to  directing  a  series  of  national  surveys  of  mathematics  and  science
education,  Dr.  Weiss  coordinated  the  Inside  the  Classroom  national  observation
study.  She  served  as  Principal  Investigator  for  several  studies  of  systemic  reform,
including the cross-site evaluation of the Local Systemic Change professional devel-
opment  program,  and  co-authored  the  Handbook  for  Strategic  Leadership  to  help
mathematics  and  science  educators  apply  the  lessons  learned  from  those  initiatives
to their practice. Dr. Weiss is currently Principal Investigator of a Knowledge Man-
agement  and  Dissemination  project  for  NSF’s  Math  Science  Partnership  program
and co-PI of the Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  BAIRD.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Weiss.  Fascinating  series  of
perspectives  from  all  of  you,  and  I  am  grateful  for  your  insights.
I will begin the questioning and then in five minutes or so we will
yield to Dr. Ehlers.

One  of  the  terms  that  came  up  repeatedly  in  various  testimony
was  outcomes  and  the  importance  of  looking  at  outcomes.  What
would each of you—and I will let each of you take a shot at this—
what  would  be  the  most  important  outcome  that  you  think  could
derive  from  participation  by  the  mission  agencies  in  the  education
endeavor?  If  you  had  to  measure  it—and  I  recognize  frankly  some
of it is rather ephemeral and may be difficult to quantify and I re-
spect  that.  Set  aside  the  issue—don’t  define  the  goal  as  something
measurable,  define  something  desirable  first  and  we  will  worry
about measure in a second. What would you think are the most im-
portant, left to right, Ms. Froschauer?

Ms.  FROSCHAUER.  One  of  the  things  I  believe  that  would  help
classroom  teachers  the  most,  and  that  is  my  perspective,  is  re-
search that would provide us with information concerning how best
to  teach  concepts  to  students  so  that  they  truly  can  conceptually
develop the ideas. The research base in many areas is lacking, and
expanding that research base would be very valuable. And most of
that can be done quite well with some longitudinal studies and look
at  how  students  actually  learn  over  a  long  period  of  time  and  add
to their conceptual understanding.

Chairman BAIRD. Mr. Lach.
Mr.  LACH.  I  think  what  would  help  most  is  having  the  federal
R&D mission agencies measure the way that they connect students
and  parents  and  teachers  to  the  practice  of  science  through  their
laboratories  and  their  facilities  and  the  way  that  they  inspire  that
same  population  to  get  excited  about  the  world  of  science  and  its
practice, focus on the informal side.

Chairman BAIRD. Dr. Nelson.
Dr. NELSON. I would like to see an outcome that would allow the
mission  agencies  to  be  full  partners  with  the  schools  and  the  com-
munity colleges and the programs that help prepare not necessarily
the very high-end, top 10 percent students who are going to be sci-
entists  and  engineers,  but  help  the  forgotten  majority  of  the  stu-
dents below that who are very necessary. We need three or four or
five  good  technicians  for  every  engineer  we  have  got  in  the  field.
Those  students  need  to  be  both  excited  to  participate  in  a  career
like that, prepared through a good K–10 kind of preparation in the
schools,  but  where  the  agencies  can  help  is  to  take  the  next  step
through  their  last  couple  of  years  of  high  school  into  community
college to prepare them to work on the cutting edge in the mission
agencies  as  high-paid,  well-prepared  technicians  and  then  support
personnel.

Chairman BAIRD. Mr. Reiner.
Mr.  REINER.  In  my,  or  our  arena,  if  you  will  I  think  the  mission
agencies  have  a  role  to  play  in  terms  of  exciting  not  only  the  stu-
dents but their parents and the general public because I think that
we need to improve science literacy, we need to have people under-
stand that science is all around them.

I  have  a  couple  anecdotes  that  I  think  apply  to  that.  Dr.  Tom
Jones, a former Shuttle astronaut, has told me that he first became
interested  in  astronomy  when  he  looked  through  the  telescope  at
the  Maryland  Science  Center  as  a  young  child.  Also,  the  current
doctor in charge of the Baltimore Public Health System remembers
going  to  a  science  summer  camp  at  the  Maryland  Science  Center
where he dissected a cow’s eye, and that gave him his first example
of medicine.

So  we  have  that  opportunity,  I  think  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies  can  help  us  in  terms  of  getting  people,  the  public,  stu-
dents, to relate to the field.

Chairman  BAIRD.  I  notice  in  those  comments  the  absolute  cen-
trality  of  hands-on  experience  which  I  know  your  facility  is—just
really  the  hallmark  of  your  facility  and  in  both  those  anecdotes,  it
was a hands-on experience that excited someone.

Mr.  REINER.  There  is  nothing  like  the  face  of  a  student  who,  in

interacting with an exhibit, suddenly gets it.

Chairman BAIRD. Dr. Weiss.
Dr. WEISS. One outcome would be student interest in science, the
wow factor that you referenced. A second would be general science
literacy.  We  have  measured  that  over  time,  and  it  has  been  pretty
disheartening  what  the  results  have  been.  And  if  the  agencies
choose to work in the formal system, then I would say the outcome
would  be  improvement  at  scale,  for  example,  having  science  text-
books  used  by  millions  of  kids  have  relevant  applications  as  op-
posed to just a small number of people benefiting.

Chairman  BAIRD.  The  scale  issue  also  is  something  many  of  you
mentioned, and I think that is a central question: How do we scale
this  up?  It  is  terrific  if  100  teachers  or  50  teachers  or  even  only
20  can  go  to  a  summer  workshop,  but  how  do  we  scale  it  to  reach
the  forgotten  majority  that  Dr.  Nelson  alluded  to?  Maybe  we  will
be  able  to  get  to  that  question  in  a  moment.  I  would  just  conclude
that  we  had  a  workshop  out  in  my  district  with  NSF  and  a  bunch
of teachers, and someone asked at one point what do you think the
goal should be; and for me, the essence is, as a science teacher my-
self actually before this job, is wonder and discipline. You said the
wow factor. I want somehow, and I think what the agencies can do
is the wonder part. There is nothing like talking to a Space Shuttle
astronaut  or  somebody  under  the  ocean  or  dissecting  a  cow’s  eye.
That wonder part is critical but the discipline part that helps them
understand it takes some rigor to answer these questions.

And  with  that,  let  me  yield  appropriately  to  a  gentleman  who
knows  first  hand  about  that,  the  Ranking  Member.  I  would  also
note  the  presence  of  Eddie  Bernie  Johnson,  former  Ranking  Mem-
ber of this subcommittee and a valuable asset to it. Thank you. Dr.
Ehlers?

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the testi-
mony.  I  am  a  hands-on  person  as  an  experimental  physicist,  and
I am a great believer in hands-on education as well. I am just curi-
ous, of the—you know, we are talking here about agency programs,
agency  ideas.  How  much  of  them  are  directed  to  the  high-school
student  and  how  much  to  the  elementary  school  student?  Let  me
just  get  an  idea  from  each  of  you  what  you  think  it  is,  let  me  say
the ratio of high-school to elementary school? Ms. Froschauer?

Ms.  FROSCHAUER.  I  don’t  know  if  I  can  give  you  an  exact  figure

42

on that, however——

Mr. EHLERS. I didn’t expect exact figures.
Ms.  FROSCHAUER.—there  is  a  great  deal  more  emphasis  on  high
school  than  there  is  on  elementary  school  which  we  know  needs
to—we need to have a shift in that. There needs to be more empha-
sis  on  elementary  school  because  as  so  many  people  have  ex-
pressed, when you are beginning in their education, we want to ex-
cite students so they actually consider taking more science as they
go through the K–12 system.

Mr. EHLERS. Michael?
Mr. LACH. [no response].
Mr. EHLERS. Okay. Dr. Nelson.
Dr.  NELSON.  I  think  there  has  been—it  moves  around.  It  is  a
moving target. I think recently people have been focused on middle
school, you know, which has been kind of a great wasteland of edu-
cation  in  terms  of  what  the  focus  and  the  coherence  of  the  pro-
grams  there,  so  it  has  been  getting  a  lot  of  attention.  My  impres-
sion is it is kind of spread evenly across the board.

Mr. EHLERS. Mr. Reiner.
Mr.  REINER.  I  think  the  mission  agencies  would  like  to  focus  on
high school. In our case we force them to tailor their content or we
tailor the content to upper elementary and middle school.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. Dr. Weiss.
Dr. WEISS. I haven’t a clue.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay.  That  is  a  perfectly  valid  answer.  I  don’t  ei-
ther,  otherwise  I  wouldn’t  have  asked  the  question.  Years  ago  I
proposed,  and  unfortunately  that  part  of  the  bill  got  removed  as  it
went  through  the  process.  This  is  when  we  still  had  Eisenhower
funding  and  we  had  a  clearinghouse  in  Columbus.  I  proposed  that
that  clearinghouse  be  charged  to  have  a  listing,  an  Amazon.com
type of listing of all of the different units available from all the dif-
ferent  public  agencies,  from  the  corporations,  the  chemical  society,
et cetera, et cetera. And by Amazon.com style I mean teachers who
used  a  particular  unit  would  send  back  their  evaluations,  you
know,  one  star  up  to  five  stars  and  tell  other  teachers  how  they
have  used  it  so  a  high  school  chemistry  teacher  wanting  to  teach
something about the gas laws would just go to that website, punch
in  gas  laws.  There  might  be  20  units  that  would  fit,  should  read
the  evaluations,  download  the  best  one  for  her  class  the  next  day.
Unfortunately,  as  I  say,  that  got  lost;  but  I  still  think  it  would  be
very useful.

The  other  thing  it  seems  to  me  would  be  useful  in  terms  of  the
government  agencies  is  some  sort  of  STEM  czar,  and  I  don’t  mean
that  literally  but  something  that  coordinates  all  the  different  pro-
grams  because  we  have  an  incredible  hodgepodge  out  there;  and
how  is  a  teacher  to  sort  them  out?  How  do  they  relate  to  each
other?  How  can  you  effectually  use  them  in  the  curriculum?  It
seems to me that having the soliciting I talked about plus some co-
herence  to  the  Federal  Government’s  efforts  might  be  very  bene-
ficial for all teachers.

Finally,  let  me  just  make  a  pitch.  In  picking  up  on  what  Mr.
Reiner  said  about  getting  kids  excited.  I  really  think  you  have  to
start in the elementary school very strongly. If we are going to get

43

the  type  of  technicians  we  need,  and  I  always  say  the  jobs  of  the
future require an understanding of the basic principles of math and
science.  I  mean,  I  think  that  is  pretty  self-evident.  So  how  do  we
convey  that  to  the  kids?  I  think  you  have  to  start  in  preschool  al-
ready,  emphasizing  these  ideas.  And  I  am  pleased  I  just  managed
to  get  attached  to  the  Head  Start  bill  last  week.  The  Head  Start
programs  also  have  to  deal  with  what  we  call  math  readiness  and
science  readiness,  just  learning  simple  skills  of  classification  and
enumeration, things of that sort. If we don’t get them started early,
they  are  not  going  to  do  it  in  middle  school.  If  they  don’t  do  it
there, they don’t do it in high school, they get to the university and
it  is  too  late.  They  have  to  spend  six  years  if  they  want  to  become
an  engineer.  So  I  think  it  is  crucial  that  these  programs  that  we,
collective we, develop for use in school be able to span the spectrum
and really develop the interest.

With that I will yield back.
Chairman  BAIRD.  I  will  yield  to  Dr.  McNerney  in  one  moment
but  I  would  like  to  give  the  panelists  the  chance  to  respond  to  the
particular issue Dr. Ehlers raised which seems intriguing to me. Is
there  such  a  clearinghouse  as  he  has  described  and  if  not,  would
it be useful to you and in what way would it be most useful?

Ms. FROSCHAUER. There isn’t a single clearinghouse for all mate-
rials  that  I  have  ever  heard  of.  There  have  been  some  attempts  to
have  clearinghouses  for  materials,  and  currently  there  is  nothing;
and it is beneficial to have a clearinghouse.

Something  else  that  is  interesting  is  that  currently  when  pro-
grams come out of an agency such as NSF, there can’t be any kind
of a rating system coming from NSF. Actually, they can’t put their
good  NSF  stamp  of  approval  on  it  and  say  this  is  what  everyone
should  be  using.  And  so  it  even  makes  it  more  of  a  dilemma  as  to
what  really  quality  programs  are  out  there  for  teachers  to  pull
from.

Chairman BAIRD. Mr. Lach.
Mr. LACH. There is not a clearinghouse that I know of other than
a web search which I know many of our teachers use. I would sort
of  add  to  the  discussion,  one  of  the  sensibilities  we  have  learned
in  Chicago  is  that  just  using  curriculum  by  itself  is  necessary  but
not  sufficient  to  get  where  we  need  to  go.  I  spend  an  awful  lot  of
time and energy connecting well-designed curriculum to workshops,
to  in-school  coaching,  to  assessments,  to  leadership  development
work,  to  grade-to-grade,  school-to-school  sequencing;  and  I  think
that part is really, really important and I would want to make sure
any  such  clearinghouse  really  highlighted  the  connections  between
all the things that a teacher has to worry about. If we make it just
a place to download a PDF of a gas law experiment, it is not going
to  be—it  is  necessary  but  it  is  not  sufficient  to  get  the  kind  of
change we need.

Chairman BAIRD. Other comments on that?
Mr.  REINER.  On  the  informal  science  education,  the  members  of
the  Association  of  Science  Technology  Centers  do  share  successful
programs; and the website of ASTC is a place that you can go. Ad-
ditionally, when we receive an NSF or NIH grant, we are required
to  share  any  findings  we  get  with  other  member  institutions,  but
I know of no other clearinghouse.

Dr. WEISS. I would like to comment on that as well. Some teach-
ers  can  pull  together  excellent  materials  and  organize  them  into  a
coherent  curriculum,  but  most  teachers  have  neither  the  time  nor
the  capacity  to  do  that;  and  in  our  research,  when  teachers  have
been  faced  with  more  than  they  can  cover  in  the  time  available,
they  make  choices.  But  the  choices  tend  to  be  based  on  what  they
believe is engaging to their students, and a lot of the prerequisites
get  lost,  the  coherent  whole  of  children  getting  an  opportunity  to
learn important science goes away.

So the kind of clearinghouse approach I would recommend would
be  to  make  these  ‘‘wow’’  factor  types  of  things  available  to  cur-
riculum  developers  so  they  can  get  into  the  system  at  scale  as  op-
posed to through the work of individual teachers.

Chairman BAIRD. Dr. McNerney.
Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  One  of  the  big  chal-
lenges we face is that STEM education is hard work. It is not easy
to  get  a  degree  in  math  or  physics  or  engineering.  It  takes  a  lot
of hard work. And so part of our job is finding out what it is going
to  take  to  inspire  this  coming  generation  to  do  that  hard  work,  to
get  involved  and  instead  of  going  to  the  frat  party  that  they  want
to  go  to,  to  actually  do  the  work  and  this  starts  when  they  are
young.  This  sort  of  drive  to  achieve  something  in  science  or  engi-
neering starts when they are young.

Dr.  Van  Reiner,  you  had  mentioned  that  you  have  scientists
come  in  to  your  science  center.  I  am  wondering,  what  is  the  most
effective  thing  in  your  observation  to  get  kids  wowed,  to  get  kids
excited and inspired about science? Is it direct interaction with sci-
entists or is it hands-on? What works the best?

Mr.  REINER.  At  the  early  ages,  it  is  definitely  the  hands  on.  As
they get into upper elementary or middle school, it is a combination
of the hands on and the direct interaction. I can remember we had
a  USGS  geologist,  a  young  woman  who  was  explaining  what  she
did for her job; and this young seventh-grader said to her, you real-
ly  like  what  you  are  doing,  don’t  you?  And  she  said  yes.  And  they
pay  you  for  that?  So  I  think  that  is—I  have  got  a  thousand  anec-
dotes. But I do believe that it is important for the scientist to have
a  face-to-face  time  with  the  upcoming  generation  if  you  will  in
order to be able to practice explaining things in everyday language.
Dr.  NELSON.  I  would  like  to  comment  on  that,  too.  I  think  one
of the issues of the pipeline that we don’t talk about very often that
is really important is we need to focus on getting kids in the front
end  of  the  pipeline.  That  is  certainly  true.  But  one  of  the  things
I  have  found  in  working  with  lots  of  students  and  trying  to  con-
vince them that they might be interested in being scientists or en-
gineers or going to work and even being science teachers is this no-
tion that the pull on the other end of the pipeline isn’t that strong.
A  lot  of  times  people  say,  well,  why  should  I  be  an  engineer?  It  is
not such a great job anymore. How attractive is it to get my Ph.D.
in biology when I could get my business degree and become a post
doc  for  the  next  eight  years,  and  when  I  am  40  I  might  get  an  as-
sistant professorship job? So I think we need to work on both ends
of  the  pipeline  to  make  the  jobs  for  students  very  appealing,  and
the  agencies  can  certainly  work  on  that  at  the  front  end  so  that
students see this as a possibility.

Think  back  in  the  ’60s  when  you  were  going  through  school  and
the  community,  the  government,  and  everybody  else  was  paying
people to go to graduate school. The universities were booming, ev-
erybody  who  graduated  could  get  a  job  right  away.  And  now  we
have  this  huge  pool  of  post  docs  and  others  out  there.  So  the  sys-
tem is different today, and I think that does have an impact.

Mr. MCNERNEY. I will yield back.
Chairman BAIRD. Ms. Johnson.
Ms. JOHNSON. No questions.
Chairman  BAIRD.  Okay.  We  will  go  to  a  second  round.  This  is

very interesting, and I appreciate it greatly.

Let us move to the issue of scale a little bit because that is some-
thing that many of you mentioned and a common thread and also,
Dr. Nelson, you talked about the challenge of—I want to sort of put
out  two  issues,  one  is  the  issue  of  scale  and  the  second  one  is  the
issue  that  Dr.  Nelson  talked  about,  about  NASA  proliferating  edu-
cational  material,  posters,  pamphlets,  et  cetera,  but  lacking  some
of  the  direction,  the  kind  of  things  that  Dr.  Weiss  maybe  men-
tioned. So I am going to throw out those two topics and open it up
to any of you about either of those topics that you want to address,
either  how  we  scale  things  up  or  how  we  watch  out  for  this  pro-
liferation  of  materials  that  may  be  well-intentioned  but  not  well-
targeted.  Mr.  Lach,  you  have  got  direct  experience  with  some  of
this, a big-scale system.

Mr.  LACH.  I  know  a  thing  or  two  about  scale.  And  I  think  that
is really the key point. A lot of what we have done in Chicago has
been based on Iris’ work among others, and I think what we found
out  is  we  may  not  have  all  the  answers  but  we  know  an  awful  lot
more about how to leverage pretty dramatic change in a large sys-
tem.  It  involves  coherence,  it  involves  an  intense  focus  on  capacity
building,  it  means  connecting  instructional  materials  to  assess-
ments,  to  coaching,  to  support,  it  means  focusing  on  leadership,
and it means pulling everybody in the community together, all the
museums,  the  universities,  the  labs,  you  know,  to  work  on  this  to-
gether. It takes a long time and it takes an awful lot of work.

Chairman  BAIRD.  How  did  you  find  time  for  the  people  and  par-
ticipating to do this? How did you get their buy-in in that system?
Mr.  LACH.  Our  work  in  Chicago  began  through  a  series  of  NSF
systemic initiative grants. It took us several years to sort of figure
out how to use them and how to use them well. And we began with
a—we  knew  that  need.  That  need  was  very  clear.  We  began  with
a  vision  that  said  this  is  how  we  are  going  to  move  things  ahead.
We  had  87  different  math  curriculum  in  Chicago  at  the  K–8  level
when  we  started.  Now  we  are  down  to  two  at  the  K–5  level.  In  a
local-controlled  district  that  takes  an  awful  lot  of  convincing  and
cajoling to do. But other groups would sort of come along once they
would see that sort of coherence. And it means, you know, tending
to your stakeholders. I spent a lot of time and energy making sure
our friends at universities, our friends at labs and museums under-
stand  the  role  that  they  are  to  play;  and  we  do  a  lot  of  back  and
forth to make sure that that makes sense.

Chairman BAIRD. What is your portfolio? Did someone crown you
as  the  science  education  czar  and  give  you  some  authority  or  is  it
just your persuasive personality that gets you through the day?

Mr.  LACH.  I  was  a  classroom  teacher  and  had  enough  of  a  loud
mouth  that  was  sent  to  Washington  to  be  a  fellow,  and  then  I
learned an awful lot from Congressman Ehlers who sort of gave me
a  perspective  about  scale  and  about  policy  that  I  just  didn’t  have
at  the  classroom  level.  And  then  when  I  came  back  to  Chicago,  it
took  a  little  bit  of  time  but  they  had  me  in  charge  of  science  and
then science and mathematics.

Chairman  BAIRD.  And  you  are  given  that  respect.  People  ac-
knowledge  that  is  your  role  and  they  look  to  you  for  help  and  you
get to give some guidance and governance I guess?

Mr.  LACH.  Yes.  I  pause  because  I  think—and  this  is  a  little  bit
of  an  aside.  I  think  one  of  the  things  we  are  learning  is  that  in-
struction and leadership in mathematics and science is really, real-
ly important; and it doesn’t exist very much in the educational sys-
tem.  There  is  lots  of  pretty  compelling  research  now  that  shows
principals and school leaders, when they lead, the practice of lead-
ership differs around leading and around mathematics and around
science;  and  that  is  not  something  most  of  the  people—most  local
and state education agencies understand and I don’t think the sys-
tem  quite  addresses  yet.  And  it  is  a  really  important  factor  if  we
are going to leverage the kind of changes we need.

Chairman BAIRD. Well, we appreciate the work you do, and I am
also very grateful to hear that an NSF grant was used so well. You
may  be  interested  to  know  in  our  NSF  reauthorization  bill  which
Dr.  Ehlers  and  I  wrote  together  we  have  actually  lengthened  the
time period for some of these demonstration projects that had been
three  years  and  you  are  out,  basically.  So  that  right  when  you  get
things  where  you  have  tweaked  it  enough  to  think  it  is  finally
working,  you  get  the  first  class  of  students  through,  then  it  runs
out.  We  are  actually  going  to  make  that  longer.  It  is  also  nice  to
know  that  somebody  who  has  worked  for  Dr.  Ehlers  has  gone  on
to  do  some  great  things.  Not  a  surprise  at  all.  You  learned  from
the feet of the master.

Dr. Ehlers is recognized.
Mr.  EHLERS.  I  am  not  sure  how  I  could  follow  that  up.  Let  me
just say that when Michael spent a year in my office, he did a bet-
ter  job  of  learning  how  Congress  operates  than  any  fellow  I  ever
had. He had an instinctive approach. And I think what really hap-
pened  when  he  got  back  to  Chicago  is  he  realized  that  if  anyone
can  understand  how  Congress  works  they  can  figure  out  how  the
educational system works.

I think it wasn’t a factor also that you arrived there shortly after
the  Chicago  Public  Schools  were  so-called  privatized  and  that  re-
sulted  in  much  greater  centralization  of  authority  and  power,  and
that is something you could leverage. Is that correct?

Mr. LACH. Yes.
Mr. EHLERS. So it was a combination. But you have done a beau-
tiful job there. Let me also answer one other question that I heard
raised  at  some  point  and  I  don’t  recall  where  or  how  but  that  was
about how one propagates this. And the best example of that I have
seen  is  the  American  Meteorological  Society  offers  a  summer  pro-
gram for teachers at I think various grade levels. But one require-
ment  of  signing  up  for  that  course,  and  it  is  a  very  good  course,
it is about a month or more and the teachers are paid for their ex-

47

penses,  et  cetera—I  think  there  is  a  stipend—but  one  requirement
is  that  every  teacher,  when  they  go  back  to  their  school  system,
have to set up workshops to teach 10 other teachers the same ma-
terial.  And  then  those  teachers  have  to  make  a  commitment  to
propagate  it  to  their  own  school  buildings.  And  so  in  a  short  time,
the  AMS  curriculum  went  from  being  just  taught  to  a  workshop
and  ended  up  with  100,000  teachers  using  it.  And  you  know,  if
somebody looked at that, perhaps it is easier than most to develop
a  concise  unit.  Kids  can  study  clouds  and  weather  and  so  forth  so
you know, there is no expense involved with equipment. But never-
theless,  I  thought  it  was  a  brilliant  idea  and  something  that  we
might pursue as well.

I  don’t  have  any  other  questions  on  my  mind  at  the  moment.  I
just  very  much  appreciate  the  breadth  of  experience  represented
here and the comments that you have made. It has given me a lot
of  insight  of  what  we  should  be  trying  to  do  legislatively  as  well
and  to  take  into  account  the  concerns  you  have  raised.  But  I  don’t
see any way we are going to break it without, as Michael has indi-
cated—I  believe  our  emphasis  has  to  be  professional  development
because  before  I  came  here  I  worked  with  a  lot  of  schools  and  a
lot  of  teachers;  and  I  found  the  teachers  wanting  to  teach  science
well,  wanting  to  teach  math  well,  but  many  were  scared  because
they  didn’t  know  the  subject  material.  Many  others  didn’t  really—
they  weren’t  scared  but  they  didn’t  know  how  to  tackle  it  and  do
it  right.  And  professional  development  is  the  only  way  you  are
going  to  deal  with  that,  and  that  is  why  the  Eisenhower  program
was a good thing, even though it didn’t always do it well. But that
is  something  we  lost  in  No  Child  Left  Behind  only  because  the
mechanisms  are  there  but  the  money  was  never  provided.  And  so
we actually lost something going from Eisenhower to No Child Left
Behind.

With that I will yield back.
Chairman  BAIRD.  Did  any  others  want  to  comment  on  the  issue

of scale or the other couple of questions?

Dr. NELSON. I would like to make a quick comment on that, and
it  relates  to  professional  development,  too.  One  of  the  reasons  I
went  back  to  the  university  that  I  went  to,  Western  Washington
University, is that it is a former normal school. It prepares roughly
500  teachers  a  year,  and  with  the  bulge  of  baby  boomers  moving
through the system now, we have a real opportunity to provide the
system  with  new  teachers,  with  young  teachers,  with  new  ideas.
And  one  of  my  stated  goals  at  the  university  is  that  I  have  been
at  this  for  five  years  now.  I  am  giving  myself  another  five  years
to say in that time I hope to be graduating teachers from this insti-
tution who don’t need remedial professional development. We can’t
always  continue  at  the  same  model  of  assuming  that  the  teachers
in  the  schools  are  not  at  the  level  we  want  them  to  be.  And  so  we
are working very hard to try and graduate new teachers who know
how  to  choose  and  use  the  best  curriculum  that  is  out  there,  who
know what good instruction looks like and can have a beginning at
least level of practice for that but also really importantly know how
to  collaborate  with  their  peers  and  to  partner  with  us  at  the  uni-
versity  and  others  to  improve  their  instruction  focused  around  the
performance of their students.

So  now  I  am  starting  to  focus  on  not  just  teachers,  but  the  ad-
ministrators are such a huge role. We are finding in our NSF grant
that probably the biggest factor on whether a school is making real
progress in improving their science education programs is the prin-
cipal who can either allow it or not allow those programs to happen
and  principal  preparation  programs  now.  Again,  we  are  having  a
big  turnover  of  principals.  We  have  an  opportunity  to  prepare  ad-
ministrators  who  understand  what  good  instruction  is,  who  can
support professional learning communities of teachers. So hopefully
in  the  future  we  can—our  professional  development  will  look  dif-
ferently. We will be able to ratchet it up to a different level.

Chairman  BAIRD.  As  the  son  of  a  principal  who  talked  a  great
deal  about  the  challenge  of  aspiring  to  be  the  academic  leader  of
the institution but being often burdened with the budgeter, discipli-
narian,  police,  liaison,  et  cetera,  I  think  you  are  right.  The  aca-
demic  leadership  provided  by  the  principal  is  absolutely  critical,
and  I  admire  the  notion  that  we  are  going  to  graduate  people  who
actually  know  what  they  are  doing  when  they  graduate.  It  really
is well put.

Dr. NELSON. Yes, it is not so much the teachers in the field now
don’t  know  what  they  are  doing.  It  is  a  different  world.  We  have
learned  a  lot  in  the  last  20  years,  and  we  are  hopefully  going  to
get that into the system.

Chairman BAIRD. Dr. Weiss, you had some comments?
Dr.  WEISS.  Yes,  I  want  to  build  on  what  Pinky  just  said.  It  was
a  while  back,  a  number  of  years  ago,  said  that  we  are  putting
teachers  out  in  immediate  need  of  a  50,000-mile  tune-up  and  that
unless  we  improve  pre-service  education,  we  will  always  be  at  the
point  of  remediation  rather  than  continuing  education.  And  we
need  teachers—like  all  professionals,  we  need  continuing  edu-
cation.  One  of  the  root  causes  of  the  mess  we  are  in  I  believe  is
that  teachers  are  asked  to  try  and  address  far  too  much  content.
As  a  result,  our  preparation  can’t  be  as  focused  as  it  needs  to  be,
our  professional  development  can’t  be  as  focused  as  it  needs  to  be.
It is scattered resources.

A  second  comment  I  wanted  to  make,  for  reasons  I  have  never
understood,  we  are  doing  better  in  developing  systems  to  support
teachers  and  principals  in  mathematics  education  than  we  are  in
science  education.  The  notion  of  professional  development  mate-
rials, models and materials that have been carefully crafted, evalu-
ated, and improved, scaffolds the efforts of lots of people and lowers
the  capacity  that  is  needed  to  do  these  well  in  the  field.  Building
on what Michael said, we need efforts, direct efforts, and I don’t be-
lieve this is a federal R&D mission agency responsibility, but direct
efforts  to  build  the  capacity  so  that  we  people  our  school  systems
with people who are ready to take advantage of the knowledge and
tools that are out there. I could go on longer but I will stop.

Chairman  BAIRD.  Very  well  put.  I  am  going  to  yield  some  time

for Dr. Ehlers. He has a follow-up question.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you  for  yielding.  I  totally  agree  with  you  on
that  issue,  and  in  terms  of  why  science  takes  second  seat  to  math
I  think  is  pretty  evident.  Everyone  thinks  that  reading  and  math
is something that everyone should understand. I find a lot of people
who  still  think  that  science  is  only  for  someone  who  is  going  to  be

a scientist or an engineer. And even if they are teachers they don’t
regard it as highly important. That is changing. But the way I got
into  science  education  was  just  when  I  was  a  young  professor  and
I was very concerned about scientific illiteracy and I asked myself,
what  can  I  do  as  one  person?  And  I  decided  to  set  up  a  special
course  to  teach  future  teachers  both  science  and  how  to  teach
science.  And  I  thought  that  was  my  role  in  life  until  it  inadvert-
ently brought me here.

It is absolutely crucial. And I continue to speak constantly to uni-
versity  presidents,  deans,  about  the  importance  of  this  and  above
all  something  I  learned  the  hard  way,  that  you  have  to  get  the
schools of education to work with the academic departments. Right
now  almost  every  campus  I  visit,  it  is  not  that  they  dislike  each
other,  they  disdain  each  other.  And  the  academic  folks  think  the
people  in  the  Department  of  Education  are  all  aflutter  about  edu-
cation,  psychology,  and  theories  of  education  and  they  don’t  know
how  to  teach  themselves.  And  people  in  the  education  department
think  about  scientists  as  up  in  the  lofty  skies.  They  don’t  know—
have the slightest ideas about what it is like to teach in elementary
school.  They  just  don’t  talk  to  each  other.  I  found  I  had  to  teach
myself the lingo of the educators, studied educational psychology on
my own so that I could communicate with them; and once that hap-
pened,  we  had  a  very  good  relationship  and  actually  worked  to-
gether.

But  it  is  tough.  The  easiest  thing  to  do,  easier  than  professional
development,  is  to  train  the  teachers  right  in  the  first  place.  It  is
going  to  take  a  lot  of  work  on  a  national  scale  to  make  that  hap-
pen.  It  is  happening,  you  are  doing  it,  Dr.  Nelson,  Arizona  State
University  has  done  it  quite  well  and  Kansas  started  some  good
programs,  Western  Michigan  University  has.  So  it  is  coming.  It  is
spreading  across  the  country,  but  it  is  still  not  highly  regarded  in
the academic world and it should be. Thank you.

Chairman  BAIRD.  Thank  you  for  those  insights,  Dr.  Ehlers.  Mr.

Carnahan, five minutes.

Mr.  CARNAHAN.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  welcome  to  the
panel. I apologize for getting here late but I did want to jump into
these  questions  here.  In  particular  I  want  to  talk  about  any  suc-
cesses  that  you  have  seen  or  ideas  you  can  share  with  us  about
how  we  can  do  a  better  job  with  partnerships  between  the  front-
line  teachers  and  the  private  sector  and  other  science  resources.  I
mean, my hometown is St. Louis as we have a wealth of higher in-
stitution  entities  there,  higher  education  facilities  there,  private-
sector  entitles  there  like  Monsanto,  Boeing,  non-profits  like  Mis-
souri Botanical Gardens and the Dane Forest Plant Science Center.
So we have got this wealth of science and engineering there in the
community, yet we still seem to have the difficulty getting some of
that  translated  into  the  classroom.  And  so  I  guess,  kind  of  a  two-
part  question,  how  can  we  do  a  better  job  partnering  with  those
kind  of  resources  to  supplement  what  we  do  in  the  classroom,  and
the  second  part  of  that  is  with  regard  to  streamlining  our  teacher
certification process for some of those retirees that maybe have had
full  careers  in  one  of  those  institutions,  how  they  could  become
qualified  to  teach  and  be  a  part  of  really  beefing  up  what  we  do
on the front line of our schools.

And I would start with Ms. Froschauer.
Ms. FROSCHAUER. Thank you, Congressman Carnahan. It is good

Mr. CARNAHAN. Good to see you.
Ms.  FROSCHAUER.  As  you  know,  we  recently  were  in  your

to see you again.

town——

Mr. CARNAHAN. Yes, indeed.
Ms.  FROSCHAUER.—for  our  major  and  national  conference.  And
we had the ability to enjoy all of those wonderful science resources
you  just  mentioned.  We  had  about  10,000  science  teachers  there  a
couple months ago, so it is good to see you.

I  do  want  to  say  something  about  the  cooperation  and  working
with  agencies.  I  know  that  Dr.  Nelson  had  mentioned  things  like
posters  and  things  of  that  sort  that  have  come  out  of  NASA  and
other  agencies  are  not  highly  utilized  by  teachers.  But  there  are
many  partnerships  and  many  collaboratives  that  have  brought
about materials and opportunities that have been very beneficial to
science  teachers.  But  they  must  be  done  carefully,  they  must  be
well-thought-out. They must be things that are actually going to be
utilized  by  the  teachers  or  beneficial  to  the  teachers  and  translate
into  student  learning.  NSTA  partnered  with  NASA,  and  in  that
partnership we considered what science teachers need. Now, many
people  have  already  alluded  to  the  fact  that  science  teachers  are
sometimes are uncomfortable with the content, especially when you
get  into  elementary  grades,  middle  schools  many  times,  and  even
a  high-school  teacher  who  may  be  teaching  outside  of  their  dis-
cipline. We know that that content is necessary. We also know that
NASA  has  the  capacity  of  providing  scientists  and  the  people  who
can  actually  contribute  the  content  knowledge.  And  so  we  utilized
that  content  knowledge,  that  expertise  with  NASA,  pulled  it  to-
gether into something that would provide teachers with contact in-
formation.

We  also  know  that  teachers  are  busy,  and  so  they  want  to  be
able to gain that content information kind of in an on-demand sort
of  basis  and  so  we  have  provided  that  actually  on  the  web  so  that
they  can  self-instruct,  they  can  also  self-evaluate  and  actually  can
develop that content knowledge, and we do that through something
called science objects. And they are available free.

Mr. CARNAHAN. Excuse me, is that a specific website, Science Ob-

Ms. FROSCHAUER. You can go into the National Science Teachers
Association website. You will find science objects, and that is actu-
ally  at  the  front  of  the  wall  so  that  everyone  can  have  access  to
them.  And  we  also  partnered  with  NOAA  and  FDA  on  pulling  to-
gether those sorts of things.

And  then  during  the  St.  Louis  conference  for  instance  we  had
many  sessions  that  were  delivered  by  NASA  scientists,  by  NOAA
scientists,  and  also  they  had  space  on  our  exhibit  floor  where  they
could  disseminate  materials  and  share  information  with  teachers.
So  there  are  some  very  strong  partnerships  when  you  consider
what  the  needs  of  the  teachers  are  and  what  the  resources  are  of
the agency and how you could pull those together to benefit teach-
ers.

Mr.  CARNAHAN.  And  so  you  think  we  can  do  the  same  type  of

things with local resources as well?

Ms. FROSCHAUER. You certainly can. And I think you probably al-
ready  realize  that  there’s  a  great  deal  of  effort  right  now  at  the
state  level  to  have  coordinating  bodies  established  similar  to  what
is  being  recommended  through  the  NSB  Council  and  also  through
the  current  ACC  recommendations,  that  there  would  be  a  coordi-
nating  body  that  would  look  at  all  of  the  efforts  that  are  taking
place  at  a  state  level  and  that  came  out  of  the  governor’s  report.
Mr.  CARNAHAN.  I  guess  the  second  part  of  my  question  with  re-
gard  to  potentially  being  able  to  certify  some  of  those  retired  ex-
perts,  engineers,  scientists  that  are  in  communities  like  that.  Has
there been any work going on that has helped to facilitate that that
you’re aware of?

Ms.  FROSCHAUER.  Well,  every  state  seems  to  have  their  way  of
providing  for  that  kind  of  certification.  There  are  many  opportuni-
ties  for  people  to  change  a  career  path  and  go  into  science  edu-
cation,  and  it  doesn’t  always  demand  that  they  go  back  to  college
for four years to get an education degree. It is actually an alternate
path to science teaching. And every state seems to have a different
way  of  going  about  that.  That  is  something  else  that  could  really
use  some  coordination  because  obviously  in  some  situations  it  is
more successful than in other situations.

Mr.  CARNAHAN.  I  guess  I  will  ask  this  of  anyone  on  the  panel.
Are you aware of any—certainly the state certification process var-
ies  widely,  but  are  there  any  sort  of  best  practices  out  there  that,
you  know,  a  certain  state  is  doing  that  we  might  try  to  copy  or
other states could look to as a leader in that area?

Mr.  LACH.  One  of  the  problems  we  have  in  Chicago  is  the  way
we  certify  teachers  is  complicated,  it  is  bureaucratic,  and  it  is  not
the  same  as  our  neighboring  states.  So  I  think  there  is  possibility
for  ways  to  streamline  that  process  and  perhaps  find  some  com-
monalities  about  what  a  high-school  biology  teacher  or  middle-
grade  science  teacher  ought  to  know  and  be  able  to  move  things
ahead.

Let  me  speak  a  moment  about  your  previous  question  which  I
think is a fascinating one, sort of how would you think this through
in Missouri or in St. Louis. I think it begins by having a clear plan,
probably  at  the  state  or  the  LEA  level.  That  takes  a  fair  amount
of  work  to  put  that  together  and  a  clear  theory  of  action  so  you
would  understand  why  the  different  aspects  of  the  plan  might  re-
sult in a boost in student achievement. If you have a plan you can
then position the various partners to take on different roles of that.
In  Chicago,  for  instance,  a  big  part  of  our  plan  is  a  core  cur-
riculum  adoption  and  implementation.  UFC  does  one  of  our  math
programs,  UIC  does  another,  Loyola  does  our  science  programs.
They  have  become  implementation  centers  within  the  district  to
move that along.

The second part of our plan is to increase the content knowledge
of our teachers by taking university courses. We have 10 local uni-
versities  that  we  provide  tuition  stipends  for  so  teachers  can  go
back  to  school  and  earn  the  state  endorsement  in  mathematics  or
science. In our plan we also have a place for this inspirational, this
wow  factor.  We  use  the  tremendous  museums  that  are  in  Chicago,

52

the  Museum  of  Science  and  Industry,  the  Field  Museum,  Adler
Planetarium,  others.  We  the  Argonne  and  Fermilab.  We  use  a  lot
of the community resources to do that inspiration sort of work.

It  has  only  been  in  the  past  year  or  two  when  we  have  had  this
plan  and—we  have  kept  with  this  plan  for  four  years  but  it  has
only been in the past year or two where I have had enough political
clout  to  be  able  to  tell  someone,  you  know,  those  posters  that  you
are  providing  and  those  one-shot  lesson  plans,  I  don’t  think  we
really need that. We have got a plan that is working, we are stick-
ing  to  that.  But  it  is  very,  very  difficult  to  do.  We  don’t  have  a  lot
of  resources  in  Chicago.  It  is  pretty  unconscionable  to  turn  them
away. Having a plan, having lots of partners invested in that plan
enables us to bring that coherence and that support.

And the last part of that that I also think that you might be able
to  help  with  is  we  need  tools  to  sustain  those  sorts  of  plans  and
that  kind  of  work.  That  means  high  level  of  capacity  in  districts
and in states for leadership in math and science education and the
appropriate amount of political cover so those people can make the
kind  of  decisions  that  are  going  to  help  kids  in  the  long  run.  It  is
very, very difficult work. It is really difficult to scale, and we need
lots  of  resources  and  help  from  you  all  if  we  are  going  to  give  our
kids what they really deserve.

Chairman  BAIRD.  Thank  you.  I  am  going  to  ask  Dr.  Weiss  a
somewhat  different  question  but  appreciate  the  tremendous  in-
sights,  and  then  Dr.  Ehlers,  and  then  we  will  open  it  up  for  final
remarks if anybody has any burning issues. So you will get each—
if you have got something you just haven’t had a chance to say, we
will get to that, too.

Just  one  fairly  brief  question.  Dr.  Weiss,  questions  can  be  brief,
the  answers  often  are  much  longer  but  the  ACC  report  talked
about  evaluation  and  the  need  for  a  control  group  design,  outcome
studies.  I  wonder  if  you  have  any—personally  I  have  some  mixed
feelings  about  that  with  the  internal  and  external  validity  issues
but I would welcome your insights as an expert in this field.

Dr. WEISS. There is no question that we need to be doing a more
rigorous job of evaluating programs. I think that the report ignores
or  underplays  some  really  key  issues,  one  I  mentioned  earlier  in
terms  of  having  measures  of  outcomes  of  interest.  Another  would
be, when people talk about randomized control trials, they tend, al-
though the report did talk about this, they tend to not realize that
we  need  multiple  such  studies.  A  program  that  works  in  a  rich,
suburban district, you can’t just now say it is going to work every-
where else, and that has been a problem.

But the other is the realities of school districts. If we were going
to try and evaluate let us say a good set of instructional materials,
you  would  want  to  have  some  teachers  using  it  and  some  other
teachers  not  and  you  would  want  to  do  that  for  a  long  enough  pe-
riod of time so you could look at the differences. Teachers need op-
portunities  to  learn  how  to  use  the  materials,  practice,  get  feed-
back.  School  districts  are  not  willing  to  do  that.  They  can’t  have
two  simultaneous  programs  going  on  and  create  whole  systems
around  it,  and  in  these  days  with  the  pressures,  all  of  the  pres-
sures on school districts, we are in this not-in-my-backyard. Every-
body  wants  research-based  programs  but  nobody  wants  to  partici-

pate  in  the  research  that  will  generate  that  knowledge.  So  I  think
there  is  a  whole  host  of  issues,  on  theoretical  grounds  you  cannot
argue. On practical grounds you can.

Chairman  BAIRD.  Dr.  Ehlers  had  a  question  and  then  we  will

conclude in a second.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Just  something  I  wanted  to  get  on  the  record.  If
there  is  a  lack—first  of  all,  I  wanted  to  ask,  if  there  is  a  lack  of
coordination  among  federal  agencies  regarding  STEM  education
programs,  how  would  you  recommend  solving  the  problem?  How
should we coordinate it and who should be tasked with the coordi-
nation. Any ideas on that?

Chairman BAIRD. I nominate Mr. Lach.
Mr. LACH. I was afraid of that. The need is clearly there. I think
what  we  found  in  Illinois  is  that  different  districts  have  different
needs  so  I  suspect  there  would  have  to  be  some  sort  of  statewide
localization  to  address  some  of  those  sorts  of  things.  I  think  there
also  needs  to  be—I  would  encourage  that  the  work  of  the  coordi-
nating—this  coordinating  body,  I  am  not  sure  who  it  should  be.  I
think  an  important  role  might  be  to  provide  really  formative  work
to  districts  and  states  to  help  them  get  better.  I  get  a  report  card
every  year  when  I  see  my  test  scores,  but  changing  education  sys-
tems,  particular  at  scale,  is  a  very  complicated,  murky  business;
and  if  I  had  a  well-regarded  report  that  told  me  based  on  the  in-
puts  I  am  putting  in  as  well  as  the  outputs,  what  I  need  to  do  a
little  more  of,  what  I  need  to  do  a  little  less  of,  that  would  help
me  organize  resources,  redeploy  my  people  in  a  way  that  would
help  sustain  that  sort  of  program.  In  Chicago,  we  would  love  that
to be really transparent. We don’t have anything to hide. We think
we  are  doing  pretty  well,  but  we  know  we  have  a  long  way  to  go.
So  some  sort  of  public  report  cards  about  both  the  inputs  and  our
outputs which I think are already public I think would help us im-
prove  and  would  help  make  sure  that  mathematics  and  science
were really on the agenda of everybody as we move things forward.

Mr. EHLERS. Does anyone else want to respond? Dr. Weiss.
Dr. WEISS. I think we need research that is focused on a smaller
number of problems of practice. Right now the research enterprise,
it is pretty wide open and so it doesn’t tend—we don’t have mecha-
nisms right now for accumulating knowledge on key problems. Mr.
Carnahan  talked  about  best  practice.  We  don’t  really  have  mecha-
nisms  now  for  knowing.  I  thought  about  the  question  of  where  are
the good, lateral entry programs, and I suspect I know the param-
eters  of  what  an  effective  approach  would  be  but  I  don’t  have  any
data  and  I  don’t  know  that  anybody  has  pulled  that  together.  So
we  need  mechanisms  for  accumulating  knowledge.  But  we  also
need incentives for using that knowledge. I was struck by the com-
ment  in  the  ACC  report  that  they  saw  no  examples  of  a  federal
agency  building  on  the  knowledge  or  models  of  another  federal
agency.  So  I  think  it  is  capacity  issues  but  it  is  also  incentives
issues.

Mr. EHLERS. Who do you think would be the best agency or per-

son to coordinate all that?

Dr.  WEISS.  Every  candidate  that  comes  to  mind  has  baggage,  so

nothing is quite coming to mind right now.

Chairman  BAIRD.  The  distinguished  Ranking  Member  would  be

an outstanding choice.

Dr.  NELSON.  Can  I  make  one  quick  comment  on  that?  I  remem-
ber  back  it  must  have  been  in  the  late  ’80s  there  was  a  group
called the Fix-it Committee, the federal Coordinating Committee on
Science  and  Technology;  and  it  started  out  with  great  promise  I
think  because  it  was  supported  at  a  very  high  level  from  many  of
the  different  agencies  in  the—federal  agencies,  and  then  kind  of
petered  out  as  the  level  of  participation  filtered  down  deeper  into
the  organizations.  And  it  seems  like  a  committee  like  that  that
could  stay  at  a  very  high  level  and  provide  a  focus  and  some  level
of  coordination  supported  somehow  by  Congress  or  someway.  That
is what you guys are good at, right? And would be able to maintain
that  focus  rather  than  expecting  to—you  know,  if  you  could  keep
a  committee  like  that  going  for  long  enough,  you  might  be  able  to
bring some kind of a coherence and focus to the program.

Mr. EHLERS. Any other comments? Thank you very much. I yield

back.

Chairman  BAIRD.  We  have  time  in  an  outstanding  group  like
this.  I  would  open  it  up  if  anybody  among  you  has  any  critical  in-
sights  or  issues  we  haven’t  had  a  chance  to  address  throughout
questioning that you feel would be a shortcoming if we didn’t raise,
let  me  give  you  an  opportunity  now.  You  don’t  have  to,  but  if  you
feel like there is something that really we should put down.

Dr. NELSON. I have a brief comment about research that I would
like  to  make.  There  is  no  doubt  that  if  you  have  a  controlled  lab-
oratory condition or you can do controlled experiments like double-
blind  drug  testing,  things  that  that  is  a  great  way  to  learn  things,
but as a research astronomer, I can tell you somehow astronomers
learn things and we can’t control anything. And so it is possible by
posing questions well and by doing a carefully designed observation
and  analysis,  it  is  important  to  learn  things  about  complex  sys-
tems.  To  make  a  point  that  we  can  learn  important  things  about
the  education  system  by  carefully—by  designing  and  carrying  out
careful  observations  and  analysis  of  existing  systems,  then  we  can
apply so not all research has to be—has to fit into this narrow——
Chairman  BAIRD.  I  think  that  is  a  great  example  and  maybe  a
way  of  an  appropriate  analogy  but  would  we  have  seen  some  star
programs  ourselves  today.  We  didn’t  necessarily  need  a  double-
blind study to observe the effectiveness of those stars.

Dr. NELSON. Certainly they are important.
Chairman  BAIRD.  Let  me  suggest—we  were  kicking  around  as
this  hearing  moved  forward,  I  think  there  is  so  much  information
that  has  been  useful  today  that  what  we  are  going  to  do,  we  will
have  a—we  have  already  scheduled  a  hearing  with  the  mission
agencies  themselves  for  June  6th.  We  will  provide  the  heads  of
those  agencies  with  the  testimony  provided  by  you  folks  today  be-
cause  I  think  it  is  so  outstanding  I  would  hope  they  would  incor-
porate the insights in their own work on the educational front. We
are also exploring the idea of possibly posting this hearing, and Ms.
Froschauer, we might like to talk to you about posting this hearing
in  some  way  where  it  would  be  accessible  to  your  members.  They
could share some of the models they have heard about how, for ex-
ample,  the  science  museums  are  working,  how  the  graduate  edu-

cation  programs  are  working,  how  Chicago  is  making  their
changes,  how  they  might  design  their  research  interventions,  and
then  offer  comments  analogous  to  the  approach  Dr.  Ehlers  was
talking  about  so  that  we  could  actually  get  further  impact  of  your
profound  insights  but  also  maybe  some  additional  people  pitching
in  and  create  a  little  bit  of  a  dialogue,  and  that  way  we  have  this
tool.  So  we  will,  if  we  may,  talk  to  you  about  if  there  is  a  forum
to  do  that,  a  bulletin  board  kind  of  model  or  something  like  that.
Without any final comments on your part, Dr. Ehlers?

Mr. EHLERS. Well, put it on YouTube.
Chairman  BAIRD.  He  said  we  could  put  it  on  You  Tube  and  the
students—well, we do have this extraordinary tool right now. I was
saying  to  Dr.  Ehlers  when  I  was  teaching  psychology  I  came  up
with  a  pretty  neat  way  to  teach  about  standard  deviations,  little
lab experiments you could do, published it in the Journal of Teach-
ing  of  Psych  if  I  remember  and  gosh,  that  is  a  rather  inefficient
way. It was a nifty little thing and it worked I think and hopefully
some  people  adopted  it  and  used  it.  But  with  the  Internet  you  can
get  those  things  out  there  so  well  if  there  is  a  coherent  way  of
using it. So we are going to try to model that through this hearing
itself.

With  that,  I  want  to  thank  our  witnesses  and  our  guests  today
and the Ranking Member and the staff for all their work and look
forward  to  continue  dialogue;  and  I  am  confident  this  will  actually
have some positive impact and appreciate very much your time and
expertise,  and  the  hearing  stands  adjourned.  Thank  you  very
much.

[Whereupon, at 11:40 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

Responses by Linda K. Froschauer, President, National Science Teachers Association

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Question submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. The witnesses provided a range of views on how R&D mission agencies can best
contribute to STEM education. To what extent is there a consensus among pan-
elists  about  what  the  agencies  can  do  well  and  what  they  are  less  well  suited
to do?

A1. Federal  agencies  should  focus  primarily  on  improving  student  achievement,
teacher  quality,  and  student  engagement.  Specifically,  the  agencies  are  well  suited
to:

Make  scientific  laboratory  experiences  and  equipment  available  to  teachers  and

students (Dept. of Energy)

Encourage  scientists  to  work  with  teachers  to  further  their  content  knowledge

(Dept. of Energy)

Work  with  universities,  the  science  community  and  others  on  model,  research-
based  programs  to  increase  teacher  effectiveness  that  can  be  replicated  (Math  and
Science Partnerships)

Develop  and  implement  proven,  effective,  research  based  instructional  materials

and methods (NSF Instructional Materials)

Recruit and retain teachers with majors in STEM fields (NSF, Noyce)
Increase the content knowledge of in service teachers with long-term, quality pro-

fessional develop (NSF, Math and Science Partnerships)

Support  activities  that  encourage  under-represented  groups  to  enter  and  remain

in the STEM fields (NSF)

Increase  the  awareness  and  interest  in  STEM  through  informal  science  activities

(NSF)

Conduct and disseminate key research in all STEM education fields (NSF)
Provide  undergraduate  grants  and  loan  forgiveness  for  STEM  teachers  (Dept.  of

Education)

The agencies are less well suited to develop curriculum or provide professional de-
velopment.  If  this  is  done,  it  should  be  accomplished  through  strong  partnerships.
Although teachers enjoy receiving posters and activities for use in their classrooms,
these  materials  do  not  support  the  development  of  conceptual  understanding
through  a  strong  curriculum.  In  addition,  many  of  the  federal  agency  programs
sponsor  smaller,  issue  based  contests  and  training  for  educators.  These  programs
simply do not reach the number of teachers necessary to have an impact on student
achievement.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Michael C. Lach, Director of Mathematics and Science, Chicago Public

Schools

Questions submitted by Representative Vernon J. Ehlers
Q1. You  mentioned  that  the  Federal  Government  could  provide  some  critical  ‘‘polit-
ical  cover’’  to  decision-makers  at  local  levels  to  help  advance  STEM  education.
Do you have any ideas on the best mechanisms to provide that cover/leadership?
A1. To best answer this question, let me take a step backwards and articulate some
of  the  factors  that  in  my  perspective  constrain  the  system  for  improving  K–12
STEM education.

• The  general  public  does  not  understand  science  or  its  practice.  Sadly,  most
members  of  the  education  establishment  (school  boards,  district  offices,  ad-
ministrators, state boards of education, principals, etc.) share this lack of un-
derstanding about STEM issues.
• The  political  dynamics  in  most  school  systems  work  against  long  term  solu-
tions.  Given  that  most  school  boards  are  elected  to  short  terms,  most  super-
intendents  in  urban  areas  last  only  a  few  years,  it’s  difficult  to  institute
broad, 5–10 year plans.
• We  know  much  about  large  scale  change,  but  have  far  from  a  precise  under-

standing about how to move large systems of schools forward.

These  three  factors  are  at  the  core  of  our  inability  to  move  solutions  forward.  I
think the potential exists for the Federal Government to help alleviate some of these
issues by establishing:

Now,  imagine  if  every  state  superintendent  and  the  board  president  of  the  50
largest  school  districts  received  a  detailed  ‘‘audit’’  of  their  mathematics  and  science
program once a year. They already receive a performance report—in the form of the
annual  test  that  the  state  mandates.  Yet  test  data  merely  tells  states  and  districts
what  to  improve,  and  doesn’t  help  them  decide  how  to  improve  it.  The  difference
is critical.

Most  districts  know  the  general  direction  they  must  travel,  but  lack  a  roadmap

that shows them how to get there.

The audit I’m imagining would be conducted by a well-respected, external organi-
zation. It would review the output data, certainly, but also the inputs—the systems
and  structures  the  state  or  district  had  in  place  that  resulted  in  the  outputs.  For
instance,  there’s  pretty  compelling  data  that  shows  a  ‘‘managed  curriculum’’  ap-
proach—a standards set of instructional materials for mathematics and science, cou-
pled  with  workshop  professional  development  and  in  school  coaching  support—is
necessary  for  significant  improvement.  Another  example  is  local  school  leadership
capacity, as principal understanding of mathematics and science improvement strat-
egies  and  processes  also  is  a  major  contributor  to  student  achievement.  This  set  of
standards  or  conditions  for  state/district  improvement  would  be  challenging  to  de-
velop, but I’d posit that there exists enough consensus within the education commu-
nity  that  they  could  be  established.  In  the  course  of  the  audit,  a  team  would  visit
the  state/district,  spend  some  time  digging  into  both  the  achievement  data  and  the
programmatic  data,  and  then  prepare  a  public  report  to  be  shared.  Perhaps  the
audit or report uses letter grades or a ranking to indicate the status of key aspects
of a STEM program, so it is easily understood by the public and news media.

Why  would  this  help?  Such  a  report  would  highlight  both  the  summative  and
formative  aspects  of  systemic  improvement  to  all  interested  parties.  As  the  reports
were  issued  each  year,  trends  and  tendencies  would  emerge,  enabling  state/district
staff  to  make  adjustments  and  new  decisions  in  light  of  their  review.  If  they  are
issued  with  regular  frequency  from  an  external  organization,  much  of  the  internal
politics  within  states  and  districts  would  be  muted.  If  a  board  decided  to  fire  a  su-
perintendent  and  change  strategies,  they’d  do  so  knowing  there  will  be  a  report
forthcoming that will hold them accountable to established national understandings.
If  a  superintendent  decided  to  put  a  large  portion  of  next  year’s  budget  into  a  new
reading  program,  the  shift  in  resources  would  likely  reflect  negatively  on  their
STEM  education  report.  A  board  president  could  use  lukewarm  ratings  on  such  a
report to galvanize support for reform efforts throughout the state or city.

Who could do this work? That’s a difficult question, and probably the biggest prob-
lem  with  this  entire  idea.  I  think  a  research-focused  organization  like  the  National
Academies could lead the development of the standards or conditions for large-scale

improvement,  probably  commissioning  some  additional  research  in  the  process.  I
worry that the National Science Foundation doesn’t have enough reach to other fed-
eral  agencies—NASA,  NIH,  DOE,  etc.—involved  in  STEM  education,  and  that  the
Department  of  Education  just  doesn’t  have  the  respect  of  the  scientific  community
to  pull  this  off.  A  new  not-for-profit  entity,  funded  by  foundations  and  business,
probably  wouldn’t  have  the  credibility  either  without  really  strong  connections  to
the  Federal  Government,  and  I  can’t  foresee  a  business  model  where  this  work
would  pay  for  itself  in  the  out  years.  I’m  left  thinking  that  the  best  (though  imper-
fect)  answer  would  be  a  new  agency  under  the  governance  of  the  National  Acad-
emies—there’s enough clout there to handle the academic needs, and enough impar-
tiality to preserve the inevitable political fights that will ensue. But that’s a consid-
erably more activist role for them that would entail considerable rethinking of their
organization and mission.

A1. I believe that the witnesses exhibited a large degree of agreement, particularly
about the important role that the federal R&D mission agencies have to play in K–
12  STEM  education,  the  fact  that  much  of  the  current  work  merely  adds  confusion
and  incoherence  to  an  already  complicated  system,  and  that  partnerships  with

cantly advance student learning.

Contribute  to  STEM  education.  To  what  extent  is  there  a  consensus  among  the

to do?

A1. I  think  there  is  considerable  consensus  among  the  panelists.  I  would  also  like
to raise one point where there is not disagreement among the panelists, but not con-
sensus either.

We agreed on the strengths that the R&D mission agencies could bring to STEM

education:

cation:

search and technology development.

• A high quality science and engineering, workforce engaged in cutting edge re-
• World-class laboratories and facilities.
• The capacity to engage in long-term projects.
• Existing  partnerships  with  university  and  industry  researchers  focused  on
• Charters  to  disseminate  the  results  of  mission  research  broadly  within  the

mission-related research.

government, to industry and to the general public.

We also agreed on general weaknesses in the agencies with respect to STEM edu-

regulated.

• Lack  of  knowledge  of  the  K–12  education  system,  now  it  is  structured  and
• Lack  of  internal  expertise  in  curriculum  development,  effective  instruction,
• Lack of expertise in education research and program evaluation.

and teacher preparation.

If we accept these ideas, then it makes most sense for the agencies to target their
efforts  on  informing  the  public  and  inspiring  the  next  generation  of  STEM  workers
through the informal education community—museums and media. Interactions with
the  formal  K–12  education  system  should  involve  close  partnerships  with  STEM
education professionals and education researches/evaluators.

There  is  some  danger  that  a  group  deeply  engaged  its  K–12  STEM  reform,  like
our  panel,  sees  the  world  predominantly  through  a  single  lens.  It  brings  to  mind
the old saying, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. As the
only  member  of  the  panel  with  a  background  as  a  research  scientist  as  well  as  K–
12 STEM education reform, I feel I should comment on the role of the R&D mission
agencies beyond K–12. I believe that the agencies can contribute more significantly
to  increasing  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  STEM  workforce  by  focusing  their  ef-
forts  primarily  on  supporting  faculty  and  students  to  engage  in  mission-related  re-
search.

Given  limited  funding  and  the  wide  range  of  STEM  education  activities  that  can
contribute  to  the  goals  stated  in  the  recent  reports  Rising  Above  the  Gathering
Storm, and the Report of the Academic Competitiveness Council, each agency should
focus  their  resources  where  they  can  have  the  largest  impact.  In  the  case  of  the
R&D  mission  agencies,  this  is  mission-related  research  as  discussed  in  my  formal
testimony.

A1. The R&D mission agencies should stay away from writing curriculum and con-
centrate on being a content resource. As such, the agencies should partner with in-
formal  education  institutions  to  help  communicate  the  science  behind  the  research
and  mission.  Educating  the  general  public  will  help  the  formal  education  institu-

Questions submitted by Chairman Brian Baird
Q1. The  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  recommended  in  its  May  2007  report
that ‘‘Funding for federal STEM education programs designed to improve STEM
education  outcomes  should  not  increase  unless  a  plan  for  rigorous,  independent
evaluation  is  in  place,  appropriate  to  the  types  of  activities  funded.’’  The  report
later  describes  ‘‘rigorous  evaluation’’  methods  in  a  hierarchy  with  experimental
methods, such as Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), as being the best meth-
odology for showing the effectiveness of a program. In cases where an RCT was
not feasible, the next best methodology would be to use a Well-Matched Compari-
son Group Study.

Q1a. As  an  expert  in  evaluation  techniques  for  STEM  education  programs,  do  you
feel  that  these  evaluation  techniques  are  the  most  appropriate  for  determining
the  effectiveness  of  STEM  education  programs  at  the  federal  R&D  mission
agencies?

A1a. As  I  noted  in  my  testimony  to  the  Subcommittee,  there  is  no  question  that
STEM  education  programs,  including  those  of  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies,
should have more rigorous evaluations. Randomized control trials (RCTs) are an ex-
cellent  evaluation  strategy  when  feasible.  However,  there  are  a  number  of  con-
straints to the feasibility of this approach that were, in my view, not adequately ad-
dressed  in  the  May  2007  report  of  the  American  Competitiveness  Council  (ACC).
First, random assignment to experimental and control groups, or quasi-experimental
designs  with  well-matched  comparison  groups  for  that  matter,  are  of  little  use  un-
less  there  are  appropriate  instruments  available  to  measure  outcomes  of  interest.
For  example,  in  Goal  2,  a  suggested  metric  for  teacher  quality  is  percentage  of
teachers  demonstrating  increased  competency  in  a  given  area.  However,  there  are
only  a  handful  of  measures  of  teacher  competency  in  specific  science  content  areas,
and even fewer in areas closely aligned with the missions of the federal R&D agen-
cies,  so  in  many  cases  even  the  most  rigorous  experimental  designs  would  not  pro-
vide  useful  information  about  the  impact  of  a  program  on  teacher  knowledge.  (I
strongly  recommend  that  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies  identify  a  set  of  key
goals,  and  that  NSF  be  asked  to  coordinate  the  development  of  appropriate  meas-
ures of those goals so the agencies will be in a better position to judge the effective-
ness of their programs in the future.)

Second,  in  my  view  the  ACC  report  underestimates  the  difficulties  and  costs  of
mounting  randomized  control  trials,  especially  if  the  intervention  is  provided  over
an extended duration or if the impact needs to be studied over a substantial period
of  time.  To  avoid  spill-over  from  the  experimental  to  the  control  group,  teachers
would need to refrain from collaborating with one another, which is directly counter
to  current  recommendations  for  establishing  learning  communities  within  schools
and  districts.  Alternatively,  the  school  or  district  rather  than  individual  teachers
could  be  the  unit  of  random  assignment,  but  that  typically  results  in  a  larger  and
much more costly experiment.

Third,  discussions  of  RCTs  as  the  gold  standard  for  evaluation  tend  to  focus  pri-
marily on judging impact, downplaying the need to understand not just if a program
is  effective,  but  also  how  it  works  and  under  what  conditions.  A  truly  rigorous  pro-
gram evaluation would include exploring the nature and quality of implementation,
as  well  as  both  proximal  and  distal  outcomes,  in  a  variety  of  contexts;  one  or  two
RCTs  or  quasi-experimental  studies  focusing  only  on  the  ultimate  impact  of  a  pro-
gram, e.g., student achievement, leave many important questions unanswered.
Q1b. What  advice  would  you  give  the  federal  R&D  agencies  for  developing  evalua-
tion methods to help them judge which programs are effective and whether pro-
posed programs will be successful?

A1b. There  are  many,  many  needs  in  science  education,  and  many  possible  ap-
proaches  to  improving  the  situation.  But  given  the  magnitude  of  the  problems  and
the scarcity of resources for addressing them, it is important that funding be limited
to  programs  that  will  make  a  substantial  difference.  In  my  view,  the  first  step  is
for  each  proposed  program—and  continuations/modifications  of  existing  programs—
to specify its goals, in effect describing what would count as success. Agencies would
be  held  accountable  for  achieving  their  specified  goals,  so  there  would  be  an  incen-
tive to identify goals that are both realistic and measurable.

Once  the  goals  of  a  proposed  program  are  specified,  the  agency  should  describe
the theory of action underlying the program design—how the planned activities are
expected  to  lead  to  the  desired  outcomes—citing  available  evidence  that  supports
particular elements of the program design. For example, teacher professional devel-
opment  programs  do  not  directly  affect  student  attitudes,  aspirations,  or  achieve-
ment.  If  a  professional  development  program’s  goals  include  impact  on  students,
then  a  case  needs  to  be  made  how  the  program  activities  will  result  in  those  im-
pacts.  A  sample  theory  of  action  might  be:  Professional  development  activities  will
focus  on  concepts  A,  B,  and  C  (a  small  number  of  important  concepts  addressed  in
national  standards  for  the  target  grade  range  that  are  relevant  to  the  mission  of
the  agency),  providing  opportunities  for  teachers  to  explore  these  science  concepts,
to learn about applications of these concepts in the work of the agency, and to con-
sider  how  their  instructional  materials  can  best  be  used  to  develop  student  under-
standing of these concepts. Teachers will gain a better understanding of the content,
applications  of  the  content,  and  use  of  their  instructional  materials,  and  be  able  to
use their enhanced knowledge in their instruction. Improved instruction will enable
students  to  see  the  relevance  of  the  targeted  content,  motivate  them  to  learn  these
concepts, and lead to improved student knowledge of those science ideas.

Is  the  program  well  designed  to  achieve  its  goals?  Prior  to  expending  resources
on implementation, it would be important to have the program design, theory of ac-
tion,  and  evidence  presented  in  support  of  the  design  critiqued  by  a  small  number
of  external  experts,  similar  to  the  process  used  by  the  National  Research  Council
for review of committee reports. Program designers’ responses to these critiques, in-
dicating  how  reviewers’  concerns  will  be  addressed,  would  be  reviewed  by  program
managers  with  input  from  another  external  expert  acting  as  ‘‘monitor’’;  only  those
programs  that  appear  to  have  responded  adequately  to  reviewers’  concerns  should
be allowed to go forward.

The next step that should take place before program implementation is the design
of an evaluation to assess both the quality of implementation and its impact, using
the  program’s  theory  of  action  as  a  guide.  Suggested  connections,  for  example  be-
tween program activities and teacher content knowledge, or between teacher content
knowledge and classroom practice, can be considered as hypotheses to be tested, and
the evaluation plan should describe how that testing will take place. (It is important
to  note  that  an  evaluation  plan  needs  to  specify  both  the  measures  to  be  used  and
the research design that will enable the evaluation to make the case that any gains
that  are  found  are  due  to  the  program  and  not  extraneous  influences.)  Only  pro-
grams that can be adequately evaluated should be considered for funding. It makes
little  sense  to  devote  resources  to  an  endeavor  if  you  won’t  be  able  to  determine  if
it is successful.

If  a  program  has  a  promising  design,  and  can  be  evaluated,  it  should  be  piloted
on  a  small  scale  to  see  if  it  can  be  implemented  with  quality  and  to  check  to  see
if  the  proposed  measures  are  sensitive  to  the  interventions.  If  not,  there  may  be
problems with the program and/or there may be problems with the instruments, the
program  should  not  be  scaled  up  until  these  problems  are  identified  and  resolved.
Only  when  a  program  has  cleared  these  hurdles—a  program  design  that  seems
promising  based  on  prior  evidence,  can  be  implemented  with  quality,  and  can  be
adequately  evaluated—does  it  merit  broader  implementation,  and  then  it  needs  to
be carefully evaluated to see if the program is in fact achieving its goals, and under
what conditions.

contribute  to  STEM  education.  To  what  extent  is  there  a  consensus  among  the
panelists about what the agencies can do well and what they are less well suited

A1. I believe there was considerable consensus on a number of issues:

• The federal R&D mission agencies have an important role to play in the infor-
mal  education  arena—including  museums  and  science  centers—in  increasing
students’  interest  in  science,  encouraging  them  to  consider  science  careers,
and enhancing science literacy of the general public.
• It is typically not helpful for the agencies to develop posters and activities for
classroom  use.  Even  if  these  materials  are  very  well  aligned  with  national
and  state  standards,  and  many  are  not,  they  add  noise  to  an  already  noisy
system,  making  it  less  likely  that  students  will  encounter  a  coherent  science
curriculum.

65

• If  the  agencies  are  going  to  be  involved  in  teacher  professional  development,
they  need  to  partner  with  groups  that  have  expertise  that  goes  beyond  con-
tent  knowledge  to  include  developing  teacher  pedagogical  content  knowledge
and skill in applying what they learn to the classroom using the instructional
materials selected by their districts.

Q2. How  would  these  programs  need  to  be  designed  so  that  they  can  achieve  class-

room effectiveness?

A2. The teacher professional development programs carried out by the federal R&D
mission agencies have the potential to enhance teacher content knowledge. (It is dif-
ficult  to  know  the  extent  to  which  they  have  actually  done  so,  as  in  the  absence  of
appropriate  measures,  evaluations  of  these  and  many  other  programs  have  had  to
rely  on  teacher  self-report  to  assess  impact.)  Getting  transfer  to  classroom  practice
has proven to be more difficult. The evidence we have available suggests that to fos-
ter  improved  classroom  instruction,  professional  development  needs  to  be  sustained
over  time,  include  a  focus  on  pedagogical  content  knowledge,  such  as  common  stu-
dent misconceptions in a specific content area, how to assess student understanding
of  the  target  concepts,  and  how  to  use  that  information  to  improve  teaching  and
learning. In my view, the agencies are not well-positioned to provide sustained, pro-
fessional  development  focused  on  helping  teachers  not  only  learn  content,  but  also
apply  that  content  to  their  instruction,  but  if  they  are  going  to  do  so,  it  would  be
helpful if the agencies partnered with groups that have the necessary expertise.

In  contrast,  I  believe  the  agencies  could  make  an  important  contribution  by  pro-
viding opportunities for prospective secondary science teachers to have an authentic
research  experience  as  part  of  their  pre-service,  or  lateral  entry,  preparation,  a
much  less  expensive  and  potentially  more  scalable  strategy  than  current  programs
targeted at that goal. Each of the agencies could develop research modules relevant
to their mission and aligned with national standards that could be incorporated into
existing college/university courses, with college/university faculty and/or agency sci-
entists serving as mentors depending on the context.

SUBCOMMITTEE ON RESEARCH AND SCIENCE

EDUCATION

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Federal STEM Education Programs

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 6, 2007

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

The purpose of the hearing is to review the K–16 science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) education activities of federal agencies and to explore cur-
rent  efforts  for  the  improvement  of  interagency  coordination  and  evaluation  of  pro-
grams.  In  addition,  agencies  will  be  asked  to  respond  to  the  witness  testimonies
given on May 15, 2007, about the educators’ views on the STEM education programs
at  federal  R&D  mission  agencies.  The  witnesses  provided  Subcommittee  Members
with  their  suggestions  for  how  those  agencies  could  best  contribute  to  STEM  edu-
cation nationwide and strongly recommended closely collaborating with educators in
the field when developing programs.
Witnesses
Dr.  Cora  Marrett,  Assistant  Director,  Directorate  for  Education  and  Human  Re-
sources,  National  Science  Foundation;  Co-Chair,  Education  and  Workforce  Develop-
ment Subcommittee, National Science and Technology Committee
Dr. Joyce Winterton, Assistant Administrator, Office of Education, National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration
Mr.  William  Valdez,  Director,  Office  of  Workforce  Development  for  Teachers  and
Scientists, Office of Science, Department of Energy
Dr.  Bruce  Fuchs,  Director,  Office  of  Science  Education,  National  Institutes  of
Health

Overarching Questions

• What  steps  have  agencies  taken  to  improve  coordination  with  other  federal
agencies’  STEM  education  activities  and,  in  particular,  what  is  the  status  of
the  new  coordinating  committee  under  the  National  Science  and  Technology
Committee (NSTC)? To what extent do agencies collaborate with educators in
the states and school districts in developing STEM education programs?

• The  recent  report  of  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  reinforces  the
need  for  better  evaluation  and  performance  metrics  for  federal  STEM  edu-
cation programs. What plans do agencies have to improve evaluation of STEM
programs?

• The  Subcommittee  received  testimony  at  a  hearing  on  15  May  on  how  the
R&D  mission  agencies  could  improve  the  effectiveness  of  their  STEM  edu-
cation programs. The witnesses were skeptical of the ability of the R&D mis-
sion agencies to develop curricular materials for formal classroom instruction
and  questioned  the  effectiveness  of  their  teacher  professional  development
programs  to  improve  teacher  classroom  performance,  while  suggesting  that
the  agencies’  most  important  role  is  in  informal  STEM  education.  The  wit-
nesses  also  strongly  recommended  closer  collaboration  by  the  agencies  with
educators  in  the  field  when  developing  STEM  programs.  What  are  agencies’
responses to the recommendations from these witnesses?

• How  do  the  agencies  determine  priorities  for  their  K–16  STEM  education
portfolios?  Have  the  agencies’  balance  of  programs  at  graduate/post  doctoral,
undergraduate,  K–12,  and  informal  education  changed  much  over  the  past
few years? Is there a likelihood of a change in that balance in the future?

• How  do  agencies  disseminate  information  about  STEM  education  programs?
What  organizations,  both  government  and  private,  have  agencies  partnered
with to reach educators in the field?

Background
STEM Education Funding

In  an  effort  to  identify  the  contributions  of  federal  agencies  to  improving  STEM
education,  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  (ACC)  was  created  in  the  Deficit
Reduction  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–171)  and  charged  with  creating  an  inventory  of
STEM  education  programs  across  federal  agencies,  identifying  the  effectiveness  of
those programs, determining areas of overlap or duplication among programs, iden-
tifying  target  populations  served  by  the  programs,  and  recommending  processes  to
integrate and coordinate those programs. After a year long study, the ACC released
a  report  containing  an  inventory  of  $3.12  billion  in  funding  for  Fiscal  Year  (FY)
2006 for 105 STEM education programs. This inventory showed that nearly 50 per-
cent  of  funding  was  directed  toward  Graduate/Post  Doctoral  programs  ($1.4  billion)
and  another  30  percent  was  directed  toward  Undergraduate  Programs  ($943  mil-
lion).  K–12  programs  received  approximately  $574  million  in  funding  and  informal
education programs received $137 million in funding.

The  agencies  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology
showed a similar balance of funding for STEM education programs with about two-
thirds  of  funding  going  to  post-secondary  programs.  The  National  Institutes  of
Health,  whose  representative  has  been  included  as  a  witness  in  this  hearing  due
to  agency’s  large  investment  in  STEM  education,  reported  a  total  of  $856  million
in  FY06  funding  with  89  percent  dedicated  to  the  Kirschstein  National  Research
Service  Award  for  graduate/post  doctoral  fellowships  ($761  million).  NIH  provided
approximately  $52  million  for  K–12  programs  (six  percent),  $37  million  for  under-
graduate  programs  (4.4  percent),  and  $5  million  for  informal  education  programs
(0.6 percent).

The  ACC  set  parameters  of  its  inventory,  limiting  the  programs  for  inclusion  to
those  ‘‘primarily  intended  to  provide  support  for,  or  to  strengthen,  science,  tech-
nology, engineering, or mathematics education.’’ The Subcommittee on Research and
Science Education, realizing that many educational activities carried out by the fed-
eral R&D mission agencies are contained within larger programs, worked with those
agencies  to  provide  a  more  in-depth  view  of  those  efforts.  Excluding  graduate  edu-
cation programs which already dominate mission agencies’ STEM funding, an addi-
tional $256.65 million in FY06 appropriated funds for K–12, undergraduate, and in-
formal education activities was identified for a total of $1.01 billion in K–16 funding
at  NSF  and  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies.  (EPA  reported  no  FY06  funding  for
K–16 STEM education activities.)

As can be seen in the table in Figure 3 K–16 STEM Ed FY06 Appropriated Funds,
roughly  an  equal  amount  of  funding  is  dedicated  to  undergraduate  activities  as  K–
12 and informal education activities combined.

Evaluation of Programs

Another consistent criticism of federal STEM education programs is a lack of eval-
uation methods which would show the level of effectiveness of a program. The ACC
studied  evaluation  processes  used  by  the  identified  STEM  education  programs  and
concluded  in  its  report  that  ‘‘there  is  a  general  dearth  of  evidence  of  effective  prac-
tices  and  activities  in  STEM  education.’’  The  ACC  recommended  that  funding  for
any  program  should  not  be  increased  until  it  can  show  effectiveness  as  determined
by  rigorous  evaluation  methods.  The  report  points  to  randomized  control  trials  or,
when  that  is  not  feasible,  well-matched  comparison  group  studies  as  the  optimal
methods for determining if a program is effective.

This  sentiment  was  echoed  by  the  witnesses  at  the  Subcommittee’s  hearing  on
May 15, 2007, Federal STEM Education Programs: Educators’ Perspectives, who ex-
plained  to  Members  that  the  absence  of  consistent  performance  measurements
makes choosing among the vast array of programs difficult and time-consuming. Al-
though  all  of  the  witnesses  agreed  that  evaluations  should  be  improved,  two  stated
that  they  did  not  think  that  research  methodologies  such  as  randomized  controlled
trials  would  be  practical  or  necessary  for  the  majority  of  programs.  Instead,  they
recommended  that  programs  focus  on  developing  design  critiques  of  proposed  pro-
grams and formative evaluations of current programs to guide decisions for building
highly effective programs.
Coordination and Collaboration

The  federal  agencies  have  also  been  criticized  for  their  lack  of  coordination  and
collaboration between agencies and with state and district education agencies when
developing  programs.  All  of  the  witnesses  in  the  May  15th  hearing  agreed  strongly

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

with the need for more effort by the federal agencies to work with educators in the
field.  The  Mathematics  and  Science  Director  of  Chicago  Public  Schools  explained
that  materials  and  programs  developed  by  federal  agencies  that  do  not  fit  into  the
district’s  curriculum  and  the  state  standards  only  add  confusion  and  distract  from
the  successful  program  they  have  built.  The  Director  of  Science,  Technology,  and
Mathematics  at  Western  Washington  University  commented,  ‘‘There  is  a  huge  in-
ventory  of  poorly-designed  and  under-evaluated  mission-related  curricula,  posters,
and lesson plans and associated professional development rarely used in classrooms
and  with  no  natural  home  in  a  coherent  standards-based  curriculum.  The  constant
barrage  of  new  resources  adds  to  the  noise  in  the  system  and  contributes  to  the
mile-wide, inch-deep problem.’’

In  response  to  this  issue,  the  ACC  recommended  that  the  National  Science  and
Technology  Committee  (NSTC),  which  serves  as  the  principal  body  for  coordinating
federal research and development, re-establish the Education and Workforce Devel-
opment  subcommittee  to  encourage  the  agencies  to  share  knowledge  and  develop  a
federal  strategic  plan  for  effectively  increasing  STEM  proficiency  nationwide.  The
NSTC recently announced the subcommittee will be co-chaired by NSF, the Depart-
ment  of  Education,  and  the  National  Institutes  of  Health.  Dr.  Cora  Marrett,  as  the
Co-Chair from NSF, has been asked to provide an update on the status of the NSTC
subcommittee in this hearing.

cation  programs.  What  plans  does  your  agency  have  for  improvements  in  its
evaluation of its STEM programs?
• The  Subcommittee  received  testimony  at  a  hearing  on  15  May  on  how  the
R&D  mission  agencies  could  improve  the  effectiveness  of  their  STEM  edu-
cation  programs.  (Witness  statements  and  video  of  the  hearing  can  be
downloaded  at  http://www.science.house.gov/publications/hearings¥ mark-
ups¥details.aspx?NewsID=1814).  The  witnesses  were  skeptical  of  the  ability
of  the  agencies  to  develop  curricular  materials  for  formal  classroom  instruc-
tion  and  questioned  the  effectiveness  of  their  teacher  professional  develop-
ment  programs  to  improve  teacher  classroom  performance,  while  suggesting
that  the  agencies’  most  important  role  is  in  informal  STEM  education.  The
witnesses  also  strongly  recommended  closer  collaboration  by  the  agencies

of  the  agencies  to  develop  curricular  materials  for  formal  classroom  instruc-
tion  and  questioned  the  effectiveness  of  their  teacher  professional  develop-
ment  programs  to  improve  teacher  classroom  performance,  while  suggesting
that  the  agencies’  most  important  role  is  in  informal  STEM  education.  The
witnesses  also  strongly  recommended  closer  collaboration  by  the  agencies

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Welcome  to  today’s  hearing,  entitled  ‘‘Federal
STEM  Education  Programs.’’  I  personally  want  to  thank  everyone
for  coming  here  today.  It  is  a  nice  audience  for  the  proceedings  of
the Subcommittee on Research and Science Education.

This  hearing  is  part  of  an  ongoing  assessment  that  the  Com-
mittee is undertaking to determine the role of the Federal Govern-
ment  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  education.  We
will  be  hearing  today  from  four  federal  agencies  about  their
progress  in  improving  STEM  programs.  As  a  mathematician  and
someone  who  believes  strongly  in  the  need  to  expand  educational
opportunities  for  the  next  generation,  today’s  hearing  holds  par-
ticular importance for me.

In the past few months, this committee has done a commendable
job  in  drawing  attention  to  the  difficulties  that  our  country  will
face  if  we  are  unable  to  increase  the  number  of  future  scientists
and  researchers.  From  the  difficult  but  not  insurmountable  chal-
lenges laid out in the National Academies’ ‘‘Rising Above the Gath-
ering Storm’’ report, to witness testimony from businesses and uni-
versities, we have heard time and again that we need more STEM
education graduates and teachers if we are to compete successfully
in the global economy.

This  committee,  under  the  leadership  of  Chairman  Gordon,  has
succeeded  in  passing  legislation  that  will  pay  significant  future
dividends,  and  will  be  a  great  legacy  for  this  Congress.  The  issues
we  are  discussing  today  are  no  less  important.  By  hearing  from
educators  on  the  front  lines  of  the  educational  system,  as  well  as
the federal agencies that must implement STEM programs, we are
laying  out  the  groundwork  for  how  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  ex-
isting programs, which will invariably lead to future initiatives.

Last  month,  the  Subcommittee  held  a  hearing  with  local  STEM
educators  to  learn  their  perspectives  on  federal  programs.  During
witness  questioning,  I  made  a  point  to  highlight  what  I  believe  to
be  one  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  any  discussion  on  STEM
education, and that is how we can reach more students, and make
sure  that  the  United  States  is  not  only  keeping  up  with  the  rest
of  the  world,  but  is  outpacing  other  countries.  It  is  hard  work  to
earn  a  degree  in  math  or  physics,  as  our  Ranking  Member  might
testify, and we need to make sure that our federal policies first and
foremost benefit our students.

Our  previous  witnesses  shared  with  us  their  recommendations
for  STEM  education  improvements.  That  included  working  with
states  and  districts  to  align  federal  programs  to  local  standards.
The  witnesses  also  expressed  frustration  that  there  are  currently
no consistent guidelines for evaluating STEM programs across gov-
ernment agencies, and we have asked today’s witnesses to respond
to the comments and recommendations from the previous panel.

In  addition,  the  week  before  last  month’s  hearing,  the  Academic
Competitiveness  Council  released  a  comprehensive  report  on  fed-
eral  STEM  education  programs.  Not  surprisingly,  the  ACC  assess-
ment was the same as that of our witnesses. Collaboration between
agencies and with State and local governments needs improvement.
Programs should be designed around best practices, and a wide va-
riety  of  educational  measurements  should  be  simplified  into  com-
mon  ones.  Each  of  the  agencies  invited  to  testify  this  afternoon

were deeply involved in the ACC’s process, and we have asked each
of  them  to  communicate  today  what  changes  they  have  made  over
the past year in order to achieve these goals.

I  am  hopeful  that  today’s  witnesses  will  shed  some  light  on  how
we  have  been  spending  scarce  federal  dollars  on  STEM  education,
and how we can improve our current practices so that we are bene-
fiting students from kindergarten all the way up. I look forward to
the discussion with our witnesses and how their agencies are plan-
ning,  coordinating,  and  evaluating  their  efforts  to  improve  STEM
education.

The  Chair  now  recognizes  Dr.  Ehlers  for  an  opening  statement.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF VICE CHAIRMAN JERRY MCNERNEY

Good  afternoon,  and  thanks  to  everyone  for  attending  today’s  proceedings  of  the
Subcommittee on Research and Science Education. This hearing is part of an ongo-
ing assessment that the Committee is undertaking to determine the role of the Fed-
eral  Government  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  education.  We’ll  be
hearing today from four federal agencies about their progress improving STEM pro-

attention  to  the  difficulties  our  country  will  face  if  we  are  unable  to  increase  the
number  of  future  researchers  and  scientists.  From  the  difficult—but  not  insur-
mountable—challenges  laid  out  in  the  National  Academies’  Rising  Above  the  Gath-
ering  Storm  report  to  witness  testimony  from  businesses  and  universities,  we’ve
heard  time  and  again  that  we  need  more  STEM  educated  graduates  and  teachers
if we can compete in a global economy.

This  committee—under  the  leadership  of  Chairman  Gordon—has  succeeded  in
passing legislation that will pay significant future dividends, and will be a great leg-
acy for Congress. The issues we’re discussing today are no less important. By hear-
ing from educators on the front lines of the education system as well as the federal
agencies  who  must  implement  STEM  programs,  we’re  laying  the  groundwork  for
how  to  maximize  the  benefit  of  existing  programs,  which  will  invariably  improve
future initiatives.

Last month, the Subcommittee held a hearing with local STEM educators to learn

most—benefit students.

currently  no  consistent  guidelines  for  evaluating  STEM  programs  across  govern-
ment  agencies,  and  we  have  asked  today’s  witnesses  to  respond  to  the  comments
and recommendations from the previous panel.

The  week  before  last  month’s  hearing,  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  re-
leased  a  comprehensive  report  on  federal  STEM  education  programs.  Not  surpris-
ingly, the ACC assessment was the same as that of our witnesses—collaboration be-
tween agencies and with State and local governments needs improvement, programs
should  be  designed  around  best  practices,  and  a  wide  array  of  evaluation  measure-
ments should be simplified into common ones. Each of the agencies invited to testify
this  afternoon  were  deeply  involved  in  the  ACC’s  process  and  we  have  asked  each
of  them  to  communicate  today  what  changes  they  have  made  over  the  past  year  in
order to achieve these goals.

I’m hopeful that today’s witnesses will shed some light on how we’ve been spend-
ing  scarce  federal  dollars  on  STEM  education,  and  how  we  can  improve  on  current
practices so that we’re benefiting students from kindergarten and up. I look forward
to  the  discussion  with  our  witnesses  on  how  their  agencies  are  planning,  coordi-
nating, and evaluating their efforts to improve STEM education.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  It  is  a  pleasure  to  be
here  to  participate  in  yet  another  event  centered  on  STEM  edu-
cation. You and I, I think, have both spent a good part of our lives
dedicated  to  education,  particularly  science,  technology,  engineer-
ing, and math education.

I do have to clarify that what the S, T, M, and E stand for, even
though  everyone  in  here  should  be  familiar  with  it,  but  I  have  to
do  that  for  anyone  who  isn’t  familiar,  because  tomorrow,  we  are
going  to  have  debate,  discussion,  and  votes  on  two  stem  cell  bills,
and so, all the papers are going to talk about for the next few days
is votes on stem cell bills. We are not talking about a stem cell bill
here  today.  In  fact,  I  think  this  is,  for  the  future  of  our  nation,
probably considerably more interesting.

STEM  education  is  a  priority  for  this  nation.  It  has  to  be  if  our
nation  is  to  survive,  to  continue  to  improve  in  the  welfare  of  its
own citizens, and frankly, also in the welfare of the world. Thanks
to constantly increasing understanding of the importance of STEM
education  to  our  national  competitiveness,  I  no  longer  have  to  go
into  a  lot  of  details  on  this,  but  even  with  this  improving  aware-
ness  of  STEM  education,  there  is  still  more  that  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  can  do  to  improve  K–12  STEM  education  in  the  United
States,  and  we  clearly  need  improvement,  because  we  are  still
ranked  near  the  bottom  of  the  developed  countries  in  STEM  edu-
cation.

The  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  was  created  by  Congress
to  catalog  and  coordinate  the  STEM  education  projects  and  pro-
grams currently supported by the Federal Government. I commend
the  agencies  that  participated  in  this  endeavor.  For  some  time,  I
have  been  very  concerned  about  the  fact  that  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  and  its  agencies  and  also  some  private  entrepreneurs  in  in-
dustry  are  developing  these  fantastically  good  programs,  but  there
is  no  overall  correlation  of  how  they  should  be  used  in  the  class-
room,  how  they  fit  in  with  the  curriculum,  and  I  think  we  should
be working on that.

I commend the agencies that have participated in this endeavor.
The  charge  to  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  was  a  chal-
lenging  one,  and  the  report  reflects  the  breadth  and  depth  of  pro-
grams that exist at our federal agencies. From the start, I harbored
a general concern that the ACC might overzealously seek out seem-
ingly  duplicative  programs,  and  inadvertently  encourage  their  de-
mise, which happened a few years ago with the Math Science Part-
nerships.  Someone  in  the  basement  of  the  White  House  noticed
that  we  had  two  Math  Science  Partnerships,  one  in  the  National
Science Foundation, one in the Department of Education, and said,
‘‘A  ha,  duplication,  we  must  get  rid  of  one.’’  Fortunately,  this  has
not happened in your case on these issues.

I  think  the  ACC  report  sheds  light  on  the  diversity  and  unique-
ness of the programs that are developed, and sends a clear message
that Congress must authorize adequate evaluation capacity for fed-
eral STEM education programs. It is crucial that we evaluate these
programs with the most appropriate and rigorous techniques avail-
able.  Overall,  the  ACC  report  provides  a  useful  foundation  for  fu-
ture  coordination  and  collaboration,  so  that  federal  agencies  can

195

work  together  to  leverage  STEM  resources  and  communicate  suc-
cesses as well as failures.

I  am  pleased  that  the  recently  reestablished  National  Science
and Technology Council Subcommittee on Education and Workforce
Development  will  follow  through  on  actions  recommended  by  the
ACC.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  today  about  how
they  are  moving  towards  increasing  collaboration,  as  well  as  be-
coming  more  educated  about  the  STEM  education  programs  at
their respective agencies.

With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Ehlers follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

STEM  education  is  a  priority  for  this  nation.  Thanks  to  a  constantly  increasing
understanding  of  the  importance  of  STEM  to  our  national  competitiveness,  I  no
longer  must  define  what  the  ‘‘S,’’  ‘‘T,’’  ‘‘E’’  and  ‘‘M’’  stand  for;  today,  my  colleagues
are familiar with the acronym. Even with this improving awareness of STEM, there
is still more that the Federal Government can do to improve K–16 STEM education
in the U.S.

The Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC) was created by Congress to catalog
and  coordinate  the  STEM  education  projects  and  programs  currently  supported  by
the federal government. I commend the agencies that participated in this endeavor.
The charge to the Council was a challenging one, and the report reflects the breadth
and depth of programs that exist at our federal agencies. From the start, I harbored
a general concern that the ACC might overzealously seek out seemingly duplicative
programs and inadvertently encourage their demise. Instead, I think the ACC report
sheds light on the diversity and uniqueness of programs, and sends a clear message
that  Congress  must  authorize  adequate  evaluation  capacity  for  federal  STEM  edu-
cation programs. It is crucial that we evaluate these programs with the most appro-
priate and rigorous techniques available.

Overall,  the  ACC  report  provides  a  useful  foundation  for  future  coordination  and
collaboration,  so  that  federal  agencies  can  work  together  to  leverage  STEM  re-
sources  and  communicate  successes  as  well  as  failures.  I  am  pleased  that  the  re-
cently  re-established  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)  will  follow
through on actions recommended by the ACC.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  witnesses  today  about  how  they  are  moving
toward increased collaboration, as well as becoming more educated about the STEM
education programs at their respective agencies.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you.  The  Chair  thanks  the  gentleman
from Michigan. If there are any Members, I don’t see any here, but
if  there  are  any  Members  who  wish  to  submit  additional  opening
statements,  your  statements  will  be  added  to  the  record  at  this
point.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Today’s  hearing  will  be  valuable  to  determine  how  to  help  the  federal  science
agencies  become  more  efficient  in  working  together  in  their  efforts  toward  STEM
education.

As  you  know,  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  recently  studied  evaluation
processes  used  by  the  various  federal  STEM  education  programs  and  concluded  in
its report that ‘‘there is a general dearth of evidence of effective practices and activi-
ties in STEM education.’’

The  ACC  recommended  that  funding  for  any  program  should  not  be  increased

until it can show effectiveness as determined by rigorous evaluation methods.

Witnesses  at  the  May  15,  2007,  Subcommittee  hearing  on  ‘‘Federal  STEM  Edu-

cation Programs: Educators’ Perspectives’’ concurred with this sentiment.

The  absence  of  consistent  performance  measurements  makes  choosing  among  the

vast array of programs difficult and time-consuming.

Mr.  Chairman,  it  can  safely  be  said  that  all  Members  of  this  subcommittee  care
deeply about our scientific enterprise and are committed to supporting and stream-
lining it to most responsibly use taxpayer dollars.

We hope to determine, from witness feedback, how to work toward that goal.
Again, welcome to today’s witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  hosting  this  hearing  to  examine  the  participation
of  federal  agencies  in  STEM  education  and  investigate  approaches  to  improving  co-
ordination and evaluation of their programs.

As we have all mentioned time and again, the Rising Above the Gathering Storm
report provided us with both the knowledge that our nation’s standing as the global
leader  in  the  STEM  field  is  at  risk  as  well  as  solid  tools  for  policy-makers  to  coun-
teract  this  worrisome  trend.  Chairman  Gordon,  you  have  been  a  tremendous  advo-
cate  for  improving  STEM  education  in  this  nation.  I  am  proud  to  be  a  Member  of
the Committee on Science and Technology—under your leadership we have success-
fully  moved  four  major  innovation  initiatives  through  the  House  just  in  these  past
couple months.

I am pleased that today’s hearing again focuses on the important task of ensuring

that our STEM programs are working to the best of their abilities.

I  am  eager  to  hear  our  witnesses’  assessments  of  these  agencies’  contributions  to
STEM education programs so that we can reflect on the successes and inefficiencies
of  the  programs  and  seek  to  make  modifications  for  improvement.  Your  first-hand
experiences are vital to maximizing the resources we are offering our nation’s aspir-
ing students.

To all the witnesses—thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to ap-

pear before us today. I look forward to hearing your testimony.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  dis-
tinguished  witnesses.  First,  we  have  Dr.  Cora  Marrett,  is  that
being  pronounced  correctly?  She  is  the  Assistant  Director  for  the
National Science Foundation Directorate for Education and Human
Resources.  Dr.  Marrett  is  also  the  Co-Chair  of  the  Education  and
Workforce  Development  Subcommittee  under  the  NSTC.  Welcome
aboard,  Dr.  Marrett,  and  she  is  going  to  be  chairing  the  new  sub-
committee,  so  it  is  a  big  burden  on  your  shoulders,  and  I  am  look-
ing forward to your words.

Our second panelist is Dr. Joyce Winterton. She is the Assistant

Administrator of NASA’s Office of Education. Welcome.

Third,  we  have  Mr.  Bill  Valdez,  Director  of  Office  for  Workforce
Development for Teachers and Scientists at the Department of En-
ergy. Welcome, this afternoon.

And  finally,  we  have  Dr.  Bruce  Fuchs,  and  he  is  the  Director  of
the  Office  of  Science  Education  at  the  National  Institutes  of
Health.

Welcome  all,  and  as  our  witnesses  know,  spoken  testimony  is
limited to five minutes each, after which each Member of the Com-
mittee  will  have  five  minutes  to  ask  questions.  We  will  try  and
limit you to five minutes, but I understand if you have a few extra
minutes to run over, but we do want to keep things in line.

So, we will start with Dr. Marrett at this point. Would you begin

your testimony?
STATEMENT OF DR. CORA B. MARRETT, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR,
EDUCATION  AND  HUMAN  RESOURCES  DIRECTORATE,  NA-

and  want  to  express  my  gratitude  to  the  entire  Subcommittee,  for
your longstanding support for excellence in science, technology, en-
gineering, mathematics education, or STEM.

The  National  Science  Foundation  appreciates  the  interest  ex-
pressed  by  this  subcommittee  and  others  in  coordination  and  eval-
uation  of  STEM-centered  activities.  In  fact,  the  National  Founda-
tion,  or  NSF,  takes  pride  in  the  actions  we  have  undertaken  over
the  years  to  enhance  excellence  across  all  levels  of  education  and
all fields of science and engineering.

We owe our successes to the interactions we have had with com-
munities  of  researchers,  educators,  diverse  organizations,  and  in-
deed,  other  agencies.  Those  interactions  have  shaped  significantly
the content of our efforts, our evaluation of them, and our dissemi-
nation strategies. We are aware, however, that we must revisit con-
tinually the approaches and connections we cultivate.

This  said,  these  are  some  of  the  ways  in  which  we  are  looking
at  what  is  the  current  situation,  and  how  we  respond  to  the  chal-
lenges  that  now  exist.  The  reconstitution  of  the  Subcommittee  on
Education and Workforce Development of the National Science and
Technology  Council,  to  which  you  have  just  referred,  that  recon-
stitution should help us in NSF strengthen our ties to other federal
agencies.  I  should  note  we  already  have  a  number  of  ties.  One  of
our most recent is a partnership through a memorandum of under-
standing  with  NASA,  and  I  am  delighted  that  Dr.  Winterton  and
I  had  an  opportunity  quite  recently  to  host  a  conference  in  which
we  had  participation  from  our  other  colleagues  here  at  the  table
and other agencies.

The subcommittee, the reconstituted subcommittee of the NSTC,
the  membership  for  it  will  come  from  the  agencies  represented  on
NSTC’s  larger  Committee  on  Science.  The  representatives  are  to
possess  substantive  knowledge  of  their  STEM  education  portfolio
within  the  agency,  and  these  representatives  are  to  have  experi-
ence  with  evaluation  research  and,  possibly,  with  the  development
and application of performance measures. So, in looking at what we
need  for  that  committee,  we  realize  it  is  knowledge  both  of  what
agencies are doing, but familiarity to work on these very important
issues of evaluation research performance measures.

The  subcommittee  that  I  am  referring  to  will  address  a  broad
range  of  issues  related  to  STEM  education.  To  use  a  phrase  that
is  often  heard  these  days,  this  will  be  attending  from  K  to  gray,
because the education portfolio does indeed cover all phases of edu-
cation  and  workforce  activities.  The  subcommittee  will  provide  a
forum  for  exchanges  of  information  and  expertise  regarding  re-
search and evaluation. On the one side, then, we have the develop-
ment,  the  reconstitution  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Education  and
Workforce Development.

Another important development, of course, is the report you have
referred  to  from  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council,  or  the
ACC.  As  we  look  at  the  report,  it  certainly  serves  to  enhance  our
attention  to  evaluation.  Now,  within  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion,  there  has  been  a  requirement  that  there  is  evaluation  associ-
ated  with  every  program  within  the  Directorate  of  Education  and
Human Resources. In fact, Congress had a lot to do with the direc-
tive that set this as expected.

We  have  responded  and  indeed  now  have  a  requirement  that  all
such  programs  within  this  part  of  the  organization  do  have  to  be
subject  to  evaluation.  But  we  have  other  work  to  do,  and  we  see
ourselves  as  attending  increasingly  to  such  matters  as  clarifying
the  objectives  of  particular  programs.  Evaluation  must  depend  on
how clear is the intent of any activity. We see ourselves as attend-
ing  far  more  perhaps  to  the  definition  of  concepts,  and  ensuring
that those definitions are shared, especially with the other agencies
that must be involved. These become fundamental issues to ensure
that  we  will  be  able  to  conduct  the  rigorous  evaluations  that  we
agree  must  be  essential  for  determining  how  resources  are  being
used. In collaboration with others, we will strive to enhance the ca-
pacity  for  and  knowledge  base  of  such  evaluation.  There  is  a  need
for  expanding  the  community,  the  experts  who  can,  in  fact,  bring
to the matter of evaluation and research the strong conceptual the-
oretical work that is essential.

There  are,  in  addition  to  these  matters  of  evaluation,  extensive
possibilities  for  expanded  opportunities  to  improve  STEM  edu-
cation,  opportunities  for  engaging  with  others  on  research,  for  ex-
ample. The hearing that you had with STEM educators, the inquir-
ies  we  have  received  from  foundations,  lots  of  private  foundations,
industrial groups, the responsiveness we have received from school
districts  and  higher  education  associations,  all  of  these  develop-
ments prompt our heightened attention and commitment to collabo-
ration, collaboration in the cause of excellence.

In  closing,  then,  we  at  the  National  Science  Foundation  will  not
rest  on  our  past  achievements.  Rather,  we  will  continue  to  foster
and tap the creativity this Nation needs for the success of our citi-
zenry  in  the  years  ahead.  I  am  willing,  of  course,  to  respond  to
questions.  This  could  be  nothing  more  than  a  quick  snapshot  of
what  we  have  in  mind,  what  we  have  done,  and  where  we  intend
to go at the National Science Foundation.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CORA B. MARRETT

Chairman  Baird,  Ranking  Member  Ehlers,  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.
Thank  you  very  much  for  inviting  me  to  testify  before  you  today  on  science,  tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.

This subcommittee’s commitment to excellence in STEM education at the National
Science Foundation (NSF) is well known, and we are extremely appreciative of your
long-standing support.

As  you  are  well  aware,  the  NSF  provides  leadership  at  the  federal  level  to  ad-
vance learning and discovery in all disciplines of science and engineering and to fos-
ter connections among the disciplines. The Director of NSF, Dr. Arden Bement, has
presented  the  case  eloquently:  ‘‘Our  job  is  to  keep  science  and  engineering  vision-
aries  focused  on  the  furthest  frontier,  to  recognize  and  nurture  emerging  fields,  to
prepare  the  next  generation  of  scientific  talent,  and  to  ensure  that  all  Americans
gain an understanding of what science and technology have to offer.’’

The questions for today’s hearing center on the coordination of STEM-related pro-
grams,  the  evaluation  of  those  programs,  and  the  dissemination  of  information
about effective strategies. These long have been central concerns for NSF, as is evi-
dent  in  activities  we  have  undertaken  over  the  years.  But  we  are  cognizant  of
changes  looming  on  the  horizon  that  will  require  heightened  attention  to  coordina-
tion, research and evaluation as well as dissemination.
On Coordination and Collaboration.

The National Science Foundation works in partnership with the research and edu-
cation  community  to  promote  excellence.  Hence,  for  us  effectiveness  is  indicated  in

no  small  part  by  the  connections  we  establish  and  maintain  with  researchers  and
educators  as  well  as  with  agencies  and  organizations  that  share  our  commitment
to excellence in STEM education. We seek opportunities to foster exchanges on mat-
ters  critical  to  such  excellence.  An  example:  the  conference  held  recently  on  state
standards for mathematics. What gave rise to the conference were the development
by states of different standards, the efforts of several national organizations to align
those standards, and the interest of state supervisors of mathematics in exchanging
ideas  and  experiences.  The  conference,  held  in  February  2007,  featured  presen-
tations  on  recommendations  regarding  standards  and  engaged  ‘‘users’’  of  stand-
ards—State and district curriculum specialists, textbook and assessment publishers,
K–12  district  and  teacher  leaders,  and  representatives  from  higher  education  and
business. The National Science Foundation served as a co-sponsor of the conference,
along  with  Achieve,  Inc.,  the  American  Statistical  Association,  the  College  Board,
the  Mathematical  Association  of  America,  and  the  National  Council  of  Teachers  of
Mathematics.  The  idea  for  the  conference  emerged  from  an  NSF-sponsored  entity:
the Center for the Study of the Mathematics Curriculum at Michigan State Univer-
sity.  That  Center  organized  the  conference,  in  concert  with  the  State  Supervisors
of  Mathematics.  The  case  illustrates  that  NSF  takes  a  broad  approach  to  the  chal-
lenges associated with coordination and collaboration.

Our  approach  to  coordination  and  collaboration  extends  beyond  the  formal  edu-
cation  sector  to  include  important  activities  in  promoting  understanding  of  science
in  the  wider  public.  Towards  that  end,  NSF  organized  in  March  2007  a  workshop
on informal science activities conducted through science centers, museums, commu-
nity projects and the media. The workshop brought designers of informal science ini-
tiatives  together  with  program  evaluators,  to  generate  guides  for  the  evaluation  of
such initiatives. The workshop included representatives from other federal agencies.
Again, the action reinforces the theme that NSF supports coordination through out-
reach—to  various  communities  and  agencies—on  matters  relevant  to  STEM  edu-
cational policies and practices.

The  informal  science  workshop  demonstrates,  too,  that  NSF  both  endorses  and
seeks  to  provide  leadership  on  program  evaluation.  The  evaluation  efforts  are  tai-
lored  to  the  goals  and  state  of  development  for  any  given  program.  Moreover,  NSF
invests  in  research  and  evaluation,  not  just  to  assess  outcomes,  but  also  to  build
knowledge about and a community prepared to advance STEM research and evalua-
tion.

A distinctive feature of the NSF STEM education portfolio is its breadth. Not only
does  it  incorporate  program  development  as  well  as  research,  and  the  informal  as
well  as  formal  sectors;  it  addresses  the  pre-college  realm,  undergraduate  and  grad-
uate  education,  post-doctoral  experiences,  and  the  STEM  workforce  of  the  Nation.
This  breadth  has  profound  implications  for  the  collaborations  NSF  undertakes,  the
evaluations it supports, and the dissemination strategies it pursues.
Subcommittee Questions

Having  provided  a  general  context  for  the  questions  central  to  this  hearing,  let

me now turn more specifically to those questions.
1. As  Co-Chair  of  the  NSTC  Subcommittee  on  Education  and  Workforce  Develop-
ment,  please  describe  the  make-up  of  the  group,  current  activities,  and  planned
activities.
In  response  to  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  (ACC)  report,  the  Sub-
committee  is  being  re-constituted  through  representation  from  the  agencies  that
comprise the Committee on Science of the National Science and Technology Council
(NSTC). The representatives are to possess (1) substantive knowledge of STEM edu-
cation programs within the given agency’s portfolio, and (2) experience with evalua-
tion  research  and/or  the  development  and  application  of  performance  measures.
These requirements will enable the Subcommittee to meets its initial goal to coordi-
nate and facilitate implementation of the ACC recommendations. The Subcommittee
is also expected to address a range of issues related to STEM education at all levels.
2. What  steps  has  your  agency  taken  to  improve  its  coordination  with  other  federal
agencies’ STEM education activities? How has your agency improved its collabora-
tion with states and districts in developing STEM education programs? Please de-
scribe  your  agency’s  commitment  to  establishing  formal  mechanisms  to  improve
in these areas.
Past coordination activities include formal memoranda of understanding with the
Department of Education (ED) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1992
and  with  the  Department  of  Energy  in  1995.  Through  the  Interagency  Educational
Research Initiative, launched in 1999, NSF, NIH, and the U.S. Department of Edu-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

200

cation  sponsored  a  program  of  research  designed  to  develop  and/or  investigate  the
effectiveness of educational interventions in classrooms across the United States.

Earlier  this  year,  NSF  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  STEM  edu-
cation  cooperation  with  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA).
The goal of this partnership is to support the development of a creative and diverse
engineering  workforce  that  comprehends  the  technical  and  social  impacts  of  tech-
nology applications and needs in a rapidly changing environment. Interactions with
NASA  precede  the  memorandum,  however,  and  include  our  joint  participation  on  a
task  force  ‘‘to  examine  the  feasibility  and  benefits  of  using  a  portion  of  the  Inter-
national Space Station payload resources and accommodations for education.’’

Among  the  ways  in  which  NSF  cooperates  with  the  Department  of  Education,
these especially warrant notice. A memorandum of understanding enabled the NSF
and  ED  to  fund  jointly  two  of  the  large  projects  in  our  Math  and  Science  Partner-
ship (MSP) programs. Moreover, almost two-thirds of the sites in the NSF portfolio
have some involvement as well with the state MSP projects that ED supports.

In  2005  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  and  the  Education  and  Human  Re-
sources  (EHR)  Directorate  of  the  National  Science  Foundation  began  collaborating
on  a  Mathematics  Education  Toolkit.  The  Toolkit  provides  resources  for  state  and
district  leaders  on  how  to  improve  mathematics  teaching  and  learning  for  Title  I
students.  The  Toolkit  represents  a  response  to  concerns  that  states  and  districts
have expressed. The workshop on standards, cited earlier, provides another example
of the NSF connections beyond the federal level.

The  coordination  challenges  in  the  years  ahead  will  extend  beyond  those  found
among federal agencies. Increasingly, foundations and corporations are investing in
STEM education and the workforce. The National Science Foundation has a leader-
ship role within the ACC and is committed to establishing whatever connections and
mechanisms  offer  heightened  possibilities  for  innovation  in  STEM  education  within
the United States.
3. The ACC report reinforces the need for better evaluation and performance metrics
for federal STEM education programs. How has your agency made improvements
in  its  evaluation  of  programs?  How  has  this  affected  your  agency’s  funding  for
STEM education programs?
The emphasis in NSF on program evaluation precedes the ACC report. A Congres-
sional mandate in 1992 set in motion a systematic plan for assessment of programs
within  the  EHR  portfolio.  The  approach  has  evolved  quite  significantly  over  time,
from  one  focused  largely  on  the  monitoring  of  developments  to  evaluations  of  im-
pacts. The evolution has reinforced the importance of enhanced capacity for evalua-
tion  of  STEM  programs  and  accounts,  then,  for  investments  NSF  has  made  in  in-
creasing expertise on evaluation.

EHR  education  programs  require  project  and  program  evaluations,  and  there  is
now greater emphasis on collecting evaluation information at the start of a program.
The  evaluation  of  a  program’s  value,  worth,  and  impacts  is  based  on  a  multiplicity
of assessment and review studies. NSF evaluation efforts range from periodic meas-
ures  of  project  activities  to  in-depth  analyses  of  a  program’s  success.  Quantitative
and  qualitative  data  are  obtained  to  measure  a  program’s  success  in  achieving  its
goals.

Our current approach encompasses a multiple method evaluation framework that
combines theory and research to better understand and assess the R&D educational
investment. This methodological pluralism enables programmatic decision-making to
be  based  on  the  preponderance  of  the  evidence  from  external  studies.  Through  the
NSTC, we will work to improve evaluation for STEM education initiatives across the
Federal  Government,  including  at  NSF,  to  ensure  that  the  most  rigorous  methods
appropriate are used to assess federal programs.
4. How does your agency determine priorities for its K–16 STEM education portfolio?
Has your agency’s balance of programs at graduate/post doctoral, undergraduate,
K–12,  and  informal  education  changed?  Do  you  foresee  a  change  in  that  balance
in the future?
Issues  for  the  K–16  STEM  education  portfolio  emerge  from  various  sources.  The
staff within NSF consists of specialists on STEM education within given disciplines,
researchers  with  on-going  connections  to  resources  and  knowledge,  and  experts  on
trends in STEM education in the United States and elsewhere. The panels that re-
view proposals, the Committees of Visitors for our programs, and the Advisory Com-
mittees for each directorate keep us abreast of developments and interests. In recent
years, reports on STEM education have yielded many recommendations, as have the
priorities  established  in  both  the  Executive  and  Legislative  branches.  In  deter-
mining priorities for NSF funding, consideration is given to the capacity of external

201

communities to pursue given lines of inquiry, the activities underway through other
agencies and organizations, and the appropriateness of the topics for the NSF port-
folio.

The Foundation strives to address a broad portfolio for STEM education, but does
not have a formula for investments at each educational level. The substance of those
investments  does  not  remain  static,  however,  for  it  must  reflect  changes  over  time
in knowledge, national needs, and capacities within our communities and NSF.
5. How  does  your  agency  disseminate  information  about  its  STEM  education  pro-
grams?  What  organizations,  both  government  and  private,  have  your  partnered
with to reach educators in the field?
The  National  Science  Foundation  disseminates  information  about  its  programs
and the results of its investments through various channels. There are websites for
particular programs. These include IGERT.ORG, a website produced by the Integra-
tive  Graduate  Education  Research  and  Traineeship  (IGERT)  program  that  seeks  to
attract to STEM research groups now under-represented in science and engineering.
Communication  and  collaboration  among  MSP  partners  is  promoted  through
MSPNet.  Similarly,  the  Center  for  Learning  in  Out  of  School  Environments
(UPCLOSE) at the University of Pittsburgh serves to link researchers and educators
who want to enhance teaching and learning in informal environments.

Publications from the National Academy of Sciences serve to share widely the re-
sults  from  NSF-investments.  Among  these:  the  path-breaking  volumes,  Adding  It
Up: Helping Children Learn Mathematics, and Taking Science to School.

Our  outreach  efforts  are  extensive.  What  we  intend  to  undertake  in  the  near  fu-
ture is an assessment of the effectiveness of our strategies in reaching under-served
communities—of educators, researchers, and institutions. Such an assessment, to be
pursued  in  connection  with  our  panels,  advisory  communities,  and  public  and  pri-
vate partners, may result in modifications to our outreach efforts.

We  in  NSF  will  not  rest  on  past  achievements  or  accolades.  Rather,  we  will  con-
tinue  to  strive  to  foster  and  tap  the  creativity  this  nation  needs  for  the  success  of
our citizenry in the years ahead.

STATEMENT OF DR. JOYCE L. WINTERTON, ASSISTANT ADMIN-
ISTRATOR,  OFFICE  OF  EDUCATION,  NATIONAL  AERO-
NAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION
Dr. WINTERTON. Thank you, Chairman McNerney and Congress-
man Ehlers. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today, and have
a discussion that we know is so important around STEM education.
NASA  certainly  recognizes  the  role  that  education  has  in  pro-
viding that next generation of scientists, engineers, and people that
are experts in technology, that will really advance the Nation’s eco-
nomic  well-being.  The  United  States  does  have  a  tremendous  need
to  sustain  our  competitive  international  collaborations,  and  we
want  to  keep  United  States’  preeminence  in  that  area.  NASA  cer-
tainly serves as a contributor towards that goal.

As was mentioned by Dr. Marrett, we have a growing number of
agency collaborations: our memorandum of understanding with the
National  Science  Foundation;  also,  we  recently  signed  a  memo-
randum  of  understanding  with  the  Federal  Aviation  Administra-
tion.  So,  it  was  very  rewarding,  as  we  signed  that,  to  see  a  group
of  middle  school  students  experiencing  our  Smart  Skies  Initiative,
that is a simulated online resource, where students get a feeling of
what  it  is  like  to  actually  land  a  sequence  of  planes  safely,  using
mathematics  as  part  of  that  learning,  and  it  was  very  interesting
to  see  their  motivation  of  seeing  the  real  world  context,  and  how
you apply your math in a type of job that is in demand.

I do serve on the interagency taskforce to revitalize the aerospace
workforce  that  has  been  mandated  by  Congress,  and  through  that,
we  are  collaborating  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  the  NSF,
NIH,  Department  of  Energy,  Department  of  Defense,  and  looking
forward  to  a  substantial  look  at  where  we  are  currently  since  the
Gathering  Storm  report,  and  what  needs  to  be  done  to  reenergize,
and make sure we are on target with those.

We  certainly  look  at  how  we  can  work  with  other  agencies.  For
instance, recently, at Johnson Space Center, we conducted a teach-
er-to-teacher  training  that  is  part  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Edu-
cation’s  initiative  to  provide  professional  development,  and  I  think
we  had  over  350  teachers  who  signed  up  and  participated  in  that
effort in Texas.

As  are  other  agencies,  we  have  a  renewed  effort  to  re-look  at
what  are  vigorous  metrics  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  our  pro-
gram,  the  efficiency,  but  also,  the  long-term  impact.  How  do  we
know  that  we  are  really  investing  our  dollars  in  the  right  place?
So,  we  actually  have  a  specific  schedule  of  how  we  will  be  looking
at each of our major programs, and looking at the impact of those,
as well.

So,  we  are  looking  forward  to  our  National  Academies  study  on
our  pre-college  programs  that  will  be  available  in  November,  and
again,  that  will  be  another  opportunity  for  us  to  see  how  we  are
doing  with  those  programs,  how  we  can  improve,  and  how  we  are
meeting our customers’ needs.

The  role  of  our  agency  certainly  includes  professional  develop-
ment. Being a former high school teacher, that is close to my heart,
and a teacher educator. And it is very important for NASA to work
closely  with  educators  as  we  develop  resources  in  a  formal  K–12

setting, or as we work with our informal partners in museums and
community-based groups like Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and 4–H.

Some of the things that we are doing, for instance, with our edu-
cator astronaut, who is a mission specialist, and will be part of our
STS–118 launch in August, we have worked with the International
Technology Education Association and the National Science Teach-
ers  Education,  to  develop  resources  so  students  can  actually  de-
velop  a  growth  chamber.  They  can  do  the  engineering.  Obviously,
that  is  a  skill  we  may  need  some  day  if  we  plan  to  go  back  to  the
Moon  and  beyond.  So,  students  can  use  their  science  background,
their engineering, at an elementary, middle school, and high school
level to develop growth chambers, and then, we actually have basil
seeds that will be flying on the Shuttle, that they can test, and see
if  their  growth  chamber  will  actually  work.  So,  that  is  an  example
of the collaboration, making sure that we are connecting to the ex-
isting  curriculum,  bringing  our  resources  that  fit  the  standards,
and  what  teachers  can  afford  to  do,  both  cost-effective  and  time-
wise,  because  we  know  that  is  very  important  in  the  curriculum
today.

Our  NASA  Explorer  Schools  is  an  example  of  how,  over  three
years,  we  work  with  a  team  within  a  school.  That  is  a  competitive
process.  Those  educators  help  us  determine  what  are  the  needs  in
that particular school, how we can meet their needs, but also, how
we sustain that afterwards. In fact, at the National Science Teach-
ers Association Conference, I had a teacher from Kentucky come up
to  me  and  say,  ‘‘I  was  part  of  an  Explorer  School.  I  am  teaching
at  a  different  school  now,  but  I  can  tell  you  I  changed  the  way  I
teach  because  of  that  experience.  I  am  teaching  more  real  world,
using  NASA  content,  with  my  students  today,  so  they  see  where
they  are  going  to  apply  their  science  and  math.’’  She  said  it  has
made  such  a  difference  in  the  responsiveness  and  interest  of  her
students in STEM.

Now, we certainly use our Digital Learning Network, which is an
opportunity for us to connect schools to our engineers and scientists
at  our  centers.  That  is  really  what  NASA  has  to  add,  our  content
that  is  new  and  relevant,  and  information  that  may  or  probably
isn’t  in  a  textbook,  our  facilities  and  our  experts  and  our  people.
So our Digital Learning Networks, for instance, I saw a school from
the  State  of  Washington  in  a  dialogue  with  the  scientists  at  John-
son  Space  Center.  So  through  that  vehicle,  we  can  reach  every
school  in  every  state,  even  if  they  are  not  within  a  radius  where
they  can  travel  to  one  of  our  NASA  centers,  although  we  certainly
encourage that.

We  balance  our  portfolio,  looking  at  higher  education,  under-
graduate, graduate, and the K–12 as a really important part of our
continuum, to have a pipeline to our workforce, not only for NASA,
but also our contractors. And informal education is certainly a way
to  engage  the  public  at  large.  We  look  forward  to  more  opportuni-
ties  to  work  with  our  counterparts  in  other  agencies,  educators,  to
really  make  sure  we  are  on  target  meeting  the  needs  of  educators
and students today.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOYCE L. WINTERTON

Chairman  Baird  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  oppor-
tunity to appear before the Subcommittee today to discuss NASA activities that sup-
port  K–16  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  (STEM)  educational
programs.

NASA recognizes the important role education plays in developing the diverse sci-
entific and technological workforce required to advance this Nation’s economic lead-
ership.  The  United  States  has  a  tremendous  need  to  build,  sustain,  and  deploy  the
skilled talent that will be required to continue America’s preeminence in space and
aeronautics  research  and  development  in  the  coming  decades.  NASA  serves  as  a
contributor for achieving such goals.

To  ensure  our  future  explorers  will  be  ready  to  continue  the  journey,  NASA  is
working with one of its most vital partners—educators. This summer, NASA will ig-
nite the flame of knowledge with the first space flight of one of NASA’s most famous
educator.  Mission  Specialist  and  Educator  Barbara  Morgan  will  engage  students
and  educators  worldwide  from  240  miles  above  Earth  aboard  the  International
Space Station.

NASA  Administrator  Michael  Griffin  recently  stated,  ‘‘The  greatest  contribution
that  NASA  makes  in  educating  the  next  generation  of  Americans  is  by  providing
worthy endeavors for which students will be inspired to study difficult subjects like
math,  science  and  engineering  because  they  too  share  the  dream  of  exploring  the
cosmos.’’

To this end, NASA educational investments are designed to:

1. Strengthen NASA and the Nation’s future workforce—NASA will iden-
tify and develop the critical skills and capabilities needed to ensure achieve-
ment of exploration, science, and aeronautics.

2. Attract  and  retain  students  in  STEM  disciplines  through  a  progres-
sion  of  educational  opportunities  for  students,  teachers,  and  fac-
ulty—To  compete  effectively  for  the  minds,  imaginations,  and  career  ambi-
tions of America’s young people, NASA will focus on engaging and retaining
students  in  STEM  education  programs  to  encourage  their  pursuit  of  edu-
cational disciplines critical to NASA’s future engineering, scientific, and tech-
nical missions.

3. Engage  Americans  in  NASA’s  mission—NASA  will  build  strategic  part-
nerships  and  linkages  between  STEM  formal  and  informal  education  pro-
viders.  Through  hands-on,  interactive,  educational  activities,  NASA  will  en-
gage  students,  educators,  families,  the  general  public,  and  all  agency  stake-
holders to increase America’s science and technology literacy.

Experience  has  shown  that  exciting  and  compelling  NASA  missions  truly  can  in-
spire the next generation of explorers, innovators, and leaders. NASA’s unique pro-
gram  content,  people,  and  facilities  can  be  leveraged  to  spark  interest,  capture
imaginations,  and  guide  students  toward  careers  in  STEM  fields  while  increasing
their scientific and technologic literacy to the benefit of the Nation.

To  prepare  future  generations  to  manage  and  lead  the  cutting-edge  research  of
tomorrow,  strategic  planning  is  essential.  NASA  has  identified  strategic  goals  and
objectives that align its portfolio of education programs with the Human Capital Ini-
tiatives  under  the  President’s  Management  Agenda  to  build  the  workforce  needed
to meet core competences. All of NASA’s education efforts are part of an integrated
Agency-wide approach to human capital management.

NASA  Education  Programs  support  multiple  goals  and  sub-goals  in  the  2006
NASA Strategic Plan. Specifically, the education programs of the Agency contribute
to the following outcomes:

• Outcome  1:  Contribute  to  the  development  of  the  STEM  workforce  in  dis-
ciplines  needed  to  achieve  NASA’s  strategic  goals  through  a  portfolio  of  pro-
grams.
• Outcome  2:  Attract  students  and  retain  them  in  STEM  disciplines  through  a
• Outcome  3:  Build  strategic  partnerships  and  linkages  between  STEM  formal
and informal education providers that promote STEM literacy and awareness
of NASA’s mission.

progression of educational opportunities for students, teachers, and faculty.

NASA Education Programs

The  manner  in  which  the  Agency  will  achieve  these  outcomes  is  detailed  in  the
NASA Education Strategic Coordination Framework. The Framework was approved

by  the  NASA  Strategic  Management  Council  in  2006  and  guides  the  planning,  im-
plementation, assessment and validation of the following portfolio of programs:
The Higher Education Program focuses on supporting institutions of higher edu-
cation  in  strengthening  their  research  capabilities  and  providing  opportunities  that
attract  and  prepare  increasing  numbers  of  students  for  NASA-related  careers.  The
research  conducted  by  the  institutions  contributes  to  the  research  needs  of  NASA’s
Mission Directorates.
The  Minority  University  Research  and  Education  Program  (MUREP)  en-
gages  under-represented  populations  through  a  wide  variety  of  initiatives.  Multi-
year grants are awarded to engage minority institutions, faculty and students in re-
search  pertinent  to  NASA  missions.  The  program  focuses  on  retaining  under-rep-
resented  and  under-served  students  in  STEM  disciplines  through  completion  of  un-
dergraduate  or  graduate  degrees  and  entry  into  the  scientific  and  technical  work-
force.
The  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  Program  provides  K–12  educators
with tools, experiences, and opportunities to further their education and participate
in unique NASA learning experiences to enhance their knowledge of STEM and in-
spire pursuit of STEM careers. The program supports the role of educational institu-
tions,  which  provide  the  framework  to  unite  students,  families,  and  educators  for
educational improvement.
Education  Technology  and  Products  (e-Education)  sustains  the  research  and
development  of  technology  applications,  products,  services  and  implementation  of
technology-enriched infrastructure in facilitating the appropriate and effective tech-
nology  based  applications  to  enhance  the  educational  process  for  formal  and  infor-
mal  education.  In  addition,  e-Education  identifies  projects  that  will  meet  the  objec-
tive  of  the  President’s  Management  Agenda  to  provide  citizen-centric  services  re-
lated to NASA Education efforts.
The  Informal  Education  Program  is  focused  on  increasing  learning,  educating
students, educators and the general public on specific STEM content areas, and ex-
panding  the  Nation’s  future  STEM  workforce.  Projects  within  the  program  produce
supplemental  educational  materials  that  are  standards  based  and  designed  to  sup-
port  facilitators  who  are  trained  or  qualified  in  STEM  education  fields,  and  are  ac-
tively  working  with  participants  to  further  enhance  their  understanding.  Informal
Education Programs also develop content based on educational standards and learn-
ing objectives to supplement and enrich an experience, visual, or activity.

The breadth of our portfolio, and how these programs have been implemented na-

tionally, can be illustrated through the following examples:

• Attracting  students  to  the  teaching  profession,  the  NASA  Educator  Astro-
naut  project  uses  the  visibility  and  educational  opportunities  created  by  the
activities  of  the  Educator  Astronauts  to  inspire  greater  K–12  STEM  achieve-
ment, promote STEM careers, and elevate public esteem for the teaching pro-
fession.  In  selecting  Educator  Astronauts,  NASA  identified  and  trained  hun-
dreds of our country’s top educators who are members of the Network of Edu-
cator  Astronaut  Teachers  (NEAT).  Approximately  180  NEAT  members  are
now  in  communities  across  America,  each  conducting  workshops  that  reach
about  90  educators  per  session.  These  efforts  result  in  strengthening  the
STEM skills of approximately 10,000 teachers annually.

• NASA Explorers Schools (NES) provide intensive training and on-site pro-
fessional development to teachers in classrooms across the country. The NES
project assists middle schools with improving teaching and learning in STEM
education  through  professional  development,  stipends,  grants,  and  curricular
support based on NASA resources. In 2006, 5,339 teachers received intensive
training  as  part  of  the  NES  project.  Additionally,  our  Aerospace  Education
Services personnel conducted sessions across the Nation, reaching 13,938 edu-
cators in other schools.

• In  addition  to  in-service  workshops  based  on  our  missions,  NASA  is  com-
mitted  to  the  pre-service  training  of  our  future  educators.  Through  the  Na-
tional Pre-Service Teacher Conference, Pre-Service Teacher Institutes and
Online  Professional  Development,  NASA  recruits  STEM  teachers  to  develop
the  confidence  and  skills  to  effectively  teach  mathematics  and  science  using
cutting-edge  technology  and  educational  materials.  Such  efforts  have  led  to
200 STEM-enhanced teachers instructing an average of 25 students per class-
room for three years, impacting a projected total of 15,000 students.

• NASA’s  four  Mission  Directorates  provide  opportunities  for  students  to  en-
gage  in  NASA  mission  related  experiences.  For  example,  within  NASA’s
Science  Mission  Directorate,  a  broad  spectrum  of  education  activities  are
sponsored,  ranging  from  kindergarten  to  post-graduate  levels.  All  of  NASA’s
science  missions  and  programs  are  required  to  have  an  education  and  public
outreach  component.  Through  a  competitive,  peer-review  selection  process,
NASA  provides  funding  dedicated  to  education  and  public  outreach  to  re-
searchers. NASA also sponsors graduate and post-doctoral fellowship opportu-
nities.  In  addition,  the  Agency  is  looking  for  new  ways  to  provide  increased
opportunities  for  students  to  gain  greater  experience  developing  and  launch-
ing their own science instruments, either in conjunction with science missions
or through its suborbital rocket and balloon programs.

• Launched  in  January  2006  as  part  of  the  New  Horizons  Mission,  the  Stu-
dent  Dust  Counter  is  the  first  student-built  instrument  selected  by  NASA  to
fly  on  a  planetary  mission.  Built  by  students  at  the  University  of  Colorado
at Boulder, the counter will monitor the density of dust grains in space. This
data  is  of  particular  interest  to  researchers.  Given  the  nine-year  travel  time,
discoveries  from  this  mission  will  engage  today’s  elementary  school  student
until college when this spacecraft encounters Pluto.

• Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) began its two-year mission on
April 25, 2007, after a flawless ride to Earth orbit aboard an Orbital Sciences
Pegasus XL rocket. AIM is the first mission dedicated to exploring mysterious
ice  clouds  that  dot  the  edge  of  space  in  Earth’s  polar  regions.  With  AIM,
Hampton  University  in  Virginia  has  become  the  first  Historically  Black  Col-
lege  and  University  to  lead  a  NASA  satellite  mission.  Undergraduate  and
graduate students from various STEM disciplines will have an opportunity to
join faculty researchers in the analysis of collected data.

• In  February  17,  2007,  NASA  launched  five  Time  History  of  Events  and
Macroscale  Interactions  during  Substorms  (THEMIS)  microsatellites  to
study  the  Earth’s  magnetosphere.  THEMIS  will  help  scientists  understand
how  and  why  space  storms  create  havoc  on  satellites,  power  grids,  and  com-
munication  systems.  Students  will  work  with  scientists  to  unravel  a  variety
of scientific mysteries.

• NASA’s  support  of  higher  education  students  is  embodied  by  the  National
Space  Grant  College  and  Fellowship  Program,  which  continues  to  pro-
vide  fellowships  and  scholarships  to  students  across  the  country.  Recent  sta-
tistics show that, of the pool of students who completed their degrees, 31 per-
cent  were  employed  in  STEM  careers  and  48  percent  continued  their  edu-
cation to the Master’s, Ph.D., or post-doctoral levels. Many consortia have im-
plemented  hands-on,  university  student-led  projects  in  aeronautics,  rocketry,
scientific  ballooning,  rocketry,  and  nano-  and  micro-satellite  development.
These types of projects provide the professional training that enable students
to be fully prepared to enter the STEM workforce.

Portfolio Management Process

Such  a  diverse  portfolio  requires  effective  management  of  the  Agency’s  education
portfolio both internally and externally, with clear roles and responsibilities. As the
Assistant Administrator for Education, I am responsible for ensuring that the Edu-
cation Outcomes as reflected in the 2006 NASA Strategic Plan are achieved. I serve
as both the head of the Office for Education, managing all responsibilities assigned
to the Office and also as the Chair of the Education Coordinating Committee (ECC),
ensuring  the  overall  planning,  coordination,  and  integration  of  the  Agency’s  entire
education portfolio.

NASA’s  ECC  is  a  collaborative  structure  that  maximizes  NASA’s  ability  to  main-
tain an integrated education portfolio and strategically manage the implementation
of  numerous  programs,  projects  and  activities  in  a  distributed  system.  The  com-
mittee consists of representatives of the Agency’s Office of Education, the four Mis-
sion  Directorates  that  provide  mission  related  content,  and  the  ten  NASA  Center
Education  Offices,  among  others.  The  committee  develops  education  strategy  and
supports me in coordinating education efforts throughout the Agency. The ECC also
provides  checks  and  balances  for  effective  internal  control  and  ensures  the  success-
ful achievement of education goals and portfolio effectiveness.
Collaboration and Coordination with Other Federal Agencies

NASA’s Office of Education is continually engaged in collaboration with other fed-
eral agencies, including: the Department of Education, National Science Foundation,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

Federal  Aviation  Administration,  Department  of  Commerce,  Smithsonian  Institu-
tion,  Department  of  the  Interior,  and  Department  of  Energy.  Additionally,  NASA
collaborates with state STEM education coalitions, through the National Alliance of
State  Science  and  Mathematics  Coalitions,  the  District  of  Columbia,  Puerto  Rico,
and the U.S. territories. Each of our Centers works closely with State and local de-
partments  of  education  to  ensure  that  our  resources  are  tailored  to  support  the
needs  of  the  education  community.  We  have  worked  hard  to  ensure  that  we  under-
stand and can respond to the needs of State or local districts.

Collaboration  and  coordination  also  occur  in  a  number  of  forums  in  the  Federal
Government  to  ensure  that  NASA’s  activities  in  K–16  STEM  education  are  com-
plementary  and  not  redundant  with  the  programs  of  other  federal  agencies.  Addi-
tionally, NASA has actively participated in the Congressionally-mandated Academic
Competitiveness  Council  (ACC),  which  found  there  is  a  dearth  of  evidence  of  effec-
tive practices and activities in STEM education and made recommendations to inte-
grate and coordinate federal STEM programs.

In  February  2007,  NASA  and  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  signed  an
historic  agreement  to  work  together  and  coordinate  efforts  to  expand  opportunities
for  promoting  STEM  education  and  to  broaden  the  participation  of  the  under-rep-
resented in those areas. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NASA
and NSF promotes a comprehensive knowledge base to be shared between the agen-
cies  to  address  national  challenges  and  manage  the  agencies’  resources  more  effec-
tively. It reflects the goals of the Administration’s American Competitiveness Initia-
tive,  whose  cornerstone  is  a  commitment  to  increase  investments  in  basic  research
in  the  physical  sciences  and  engineering,  strengthen  K–12  math  and  science  edu-
cation,  and  build  a  well-educated,  skilled  workforce.  One  of  the  first  results  of  the
collaboration  was  a  three  day  joint  NASA–NSF  Research  Education  Opportunity
Conference  for  Principal  Investigators,  Faculty,  and  Partners.  Over  three  hundred
members  of  the  academic  community  gathered  to  be  trained  on  ways  to  strengthen
their ability to compete for research grants and to leverage their partnerships with
the agencies.

Earlier this month, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) signed
an MOU to foster the development of students’ skills in STEM. The agreement sup-
ports  the  FAA’s  mission  to  provide  the  safest,  most  efficient  airspace  system  in  the
world and NASA’s mission to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific dis-
covery and aeronautics research. The partnership includes a broad range of coopera-
tive  outreach  activities.  The  agencies’  initial  focus  is  on  a  NASA  resource  called,
‘‘Smart Skies.’’ Smart Skies is an online air traffic control simulator for students in
fifth through ninth grades. It offers a fun and exciting way to learn math and skills
central  to  air  traffic  control  while  providing  multiple  modes  of  problem  solving  for
students  who  learn  in  different  ways.  The  agreement  unites  the  strengths  of  both
agencies to provide the best of aviation-related educational products and experiences
to the widest possible population of students and educators.
Sharing Best Practices

Through our work with the ACC, we are strengthening our evaluation methodolo-

gies and sharing some of our best practices, for example:
The Harriett G. Jenkins Pre-doctoral Fellowship Program (JPFP) is a model
of  a  STEM  education  pipeline  program  that  can  be  replicated  by  other  agencies  as
a  best  practice.  While  the  success  of  the  JPFP  can  easily  be  quantified  by  counting
the  number  of  students  participants  (121),  the  number  of  awards  provided  to  con-
duct research at a NASA center (90) or the number of successful mentoring relation-
ships  that  were  established  through  this  program  (121),  the  greatest  accomplish-
ment  of  the  program  is  an  exceptionally  diverse  group  of  under-represented  STEM
scholars  who  are  excited  about  pursuing  NASA-related  advanced  degrees  that  will
equip  them  to  participate  in  the  space  exploration  workforce.  To  date,  the  Jenkins
project  has  produced  34  M.S.  degrees  and  32  Ph.D.  degrees  in  NASA-related  dis-
ciplines.
Another  stellar  NASA  project  identified  as  a  best  practice  is  the  Science,  Engi-
neering,  Mathematics,  and  Aerospace  Academy  (SEMAA).  The  Ash  Institute
for  Democratic  Governance  and  Innovation  at  Harvard  University’s  John  F.  Ken-
nedy  School  of  Government  announced  that  SEMAA  was  among  the  top  eighteen
programs  in  the  2007  Innovations  in  the  American  Government  Awards  competi-
tion. Selected from a pool of nearly 1,000 applicants, these initiatives are being rec-
ognized  as  the  government’s  best  efforts  for  their  novelty  and  creativity,  effective-
ness at addressing significant issues, and potential to be replicated by other jurisdic-
tions.  Finalists  presented  before  the  National  Selection  Committee  at  the  Kennedy
School on May 15, 2007, and winners will be announced in September.

Evaluation of NASA Education Programs

208

The Agency’s many Education initiatives have not been evaluated in a comprehen-
sive,  rigorous  manner  to  indicate  how  well  all  of  our  programs  are  performing  in
support of our outcome goals. We are committed, however, to enhancing and improv-
ing our evaluation procedures.

The Agency has taken several major steps to improve the evaluation function by:
(a) incorporating a detailed evaluation plan into its Education Strategy Frame-

work;

(b) defining  an  enhanced  set  of  outcome-based  performance  measures;  articu-

lating specific roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability; and,

(c) allocating  the  resources  necessary  to  support  rigorous  evaluations  and  the

overall evaluation function.

A  range  of  processes  will  be  used  to  capture  the  total  picture  of  education  across
NASA  and  to  assess  the  education  portfolio  for  its  effectiveness  in:  achieving  the
stated  outcomes;  establishing  linkages  within  the  framework;  and  determining  the
level  of  quality,  impact  and  comprehensiveness  of  the  portfolio.  The  ECC  will  em-
ploy  an  appropriate  mix  of  methodologies,  ranging  from  basic  quantitative  data  to
qualitative information, to assess the overall condition of the education portfolio.

Coincident  with  the  adoption  of  a  new  education  framework  and  outcomes  in
FY06,  NASA  developed  a  corresponding  set  of  objectives  and  outcome  measures.
Baselines  for  these  measures  are  being  established  with  FY07  data.  The  outcome
measures include, but are not limited to the following:

• Percentage of student participants employed by NASA, aerospace contractors,

universities, & other educational institutions.

• Percentage of undergraduate students who move on to advanced education in

NASA-related disciplines.

• Level of student interest in science and technology careers resulting from ele-

mentary and secondary NASA education programs.

The  most  significant  improvement  NASA  is  making  to  its  evaluation  efforts  is  to
make  use  of  independent,  credible  evaluators  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of  edu-
cation investments. Project-level evaluations will be conducted on three to five of our
major projects each year, with the objective of evaluating each project at least once
every five years. In collaboration with the National Science Foundation and the Of-
fice  of  Management  and  Budget,  we  are  working  to  determine  the  best  ways  to
apply a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) model of evaluation to demonstrate the
impact of our portfolio of programs. Projects that cannot be reliably evaluated using
RCT  methods  will  be  evaluated  in  an  objective  and  credible  manner,  conforming  to
the standards of professional practices.
Public Awareness and Access to NASA Education Programs

NASA Education is a cross-cutting process that engages the public in shaping and
sharing the experience of exploration and discovery. The President’s FY 2008 budget
request for NASA’s Education program is $153.7 million. Through the Office of Stra-
tegic Communications, the Agency is building and maintaining public awareness for
the activities and goals focusing on science, education, aeronautical research and ex-
ploration.

As  part  of  the  Agency’s  long-term  strategy  in  promoting  public  awareness,  Na-
tional  Education  Campaigns  designed  to  build  a  comprehensive  education  initiative
that engage diverse audiences with tailored modes of interaction have become com-
mon practice for assisting the Agency with public engagement and the formation of
national and international visibility and recognition. STS–118, the first Space Flight
of an Educator Astronaut, is a good example of a National Education Campaign de-
signed  not  only  to  engage  students  and  educators  but  also  increase  America’s
science and technology literacy.

NASA  disseminates  its  education  content  including  STEM-related  materials
through  resources  designed  to  reach  all  education  audiences—formal,  informal  and
the  public  at-large—as  well  internal  dissemination  networks  such  as  Aerospace
Education Services Program (AESP) and Space Grant.

The  NASA  Portal  opens  the  door  to  all  the  resources  that  NASA  has  available.
From  there,  educators  can  either  download  materials  for  use,  or  obtain  copies  from
the  Central  Operations  of  Resources  for  Educators  (CORE).  CORE  is  a  worldwide
distribution center for NASA’s educational material.

The Role of Partnerships

Strategic  alliances  with  non-governmental  organizations  provide  an  immediate
springboard  as  unfunded  collaborators  to  produce,  market,  and  distribute  edu-
cational information about NASA’s projects and programs. NASA’s partnership with
the  International  Technology  Education  Association  is  one  of  many  venues  the
Agency  uses  to  reach  students  and  educators  across  the  country.  Other  organiza-
tions include the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Aerospace, Na-
tional  Science  Teachers  Association,  AOL’s  Kids  On-Line,  the  Girl  Scouts  of  the
USA, Imaginary Lines, and Reader’s Digest.

Imagine,  with  the  right  partners,  what  NASA  can  do  to  strengthen  and  support
STEM  education.  Powerful  technologies  can  enable  new  learning  environments
using simulations, visualizations, immersive environments, game playing, intelligent
tutors and avatars, learner networking, and usable building blocks of content. These
capabilities  can  create  rich  and  compelling  learning  opportunities  that  meet  the
needs  of  learners  while  empowering  educators  to  unlock  the  potential  in  each  stu-
dent’s heart and mind. NASA can unite with the technology and education commu-
nities  in  dialogue,  understanding  and  action.  Students  and  educators  can  have  ac-
cess  to  a  new  renaissance  of  learning  for  the  benefit  of  the  Nation  and  the  world.
Conclusion

I would like to commend the Subcommittee for its efforts to improve K–16 STEM
education.  The  educational  achievement  of  America’s  next  generation  is  an  issue
that  reaches  our  nation  at  all  levels.  NASA  will  continue  to  partner  with  federal,
industry, State and local organizations and invest our resources toward a shared vi-
sion to secure those jobs critical to the 21st century workforce. This means not only
inspiring  the  next  generation  of  leaders  and  explorers  but  also  providing  educators
with  unique  resources  to  support  educational  excellence  in  STEM  while  improving
scientific literacy.

The  President,  Administrator  Griffin,  and  all  of  NASA  share  the  belief  that  a
highly educated and well-prepared workforce has been and continues to be essential
to this country and the Agency. NASA’s investment in education is indeed an invest-
ment in America’s future.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important hearing. I am pre-

pared to respond to any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOYCE L. WINTERTON

Dr.  Joyce  Leavitt  Winterton,  NASA’s  Assistant  Administrator  for  Education,  di-
rects the development and implementation of the Agency’s education programs that
strengthen student involvement and public awareness of its scientific goals and mis-
sions.  In  this  role,  she  leads  the  agency  in  inspiring  interest  in  science,  technology,
engineering,  and  mathematics,  as  few  other  organizations  can  through  its  unique
mission,  workforce,  facilities,  research  and  innovations.  As  Assistant  Administrator
for Education, Winterton chairs the Education Coordinating Committee, an agency-
wide  collaborative  structure  that  maximizes  NASA’s  ability  to  manage  and  imple-
ment  its  education  portfolio.  The  ECC  works  to  ensure  that  the  Agency’s  education
investments are focused on supporting the Nation’s education efforts to develop the
skilled workforce necessary to achieve the Agency’s goals and objectives. Before com-
ing  to  NASA,  Winterton  served  as  the  Director  of  Education  Programs  for  USA
TODAY, and developed educational strategies, resources and partnerships for its K–
12 and collegiate programs. During her nine years at USA TODAY, she created in-
novative cross-curricular educational approaches, including case studies, content de-
velopment  and  on-line  collaborations.  She  was  the  founder  and  President  of
Winterton Associates, a consulting firm that specializes in working on joint projects
with business and industry, education, and government. The firm has served as the
evaluator  for  National  Science  Foundation  projects  and  U.S.  Department  of  Edu-
cation-funded  programs,  including  six  national  skill  standards  projects  since  1991.
Winterton’s previous experience includes serving as the team leader for partner de-
velopment for the National Future Farmers of America student organization, where
she planned and developed partnerships and strategies to communicate the benefits
of  agricultural  education  and  a  student  organization  with  over  450,000  members.
She  has  also  been  an  education  training  consultant  for  FranklinCovey  Inc.  where
she  facilitated  time  management  and  personal  effectiveness  workshops  for  national
student  leadership  organizations.  In  1986,  Winterton  became  the  executive  director
of  the  National  Council  on  Vocational  Technical  Education,  a  Presidential  Advisory
Council providing recommendations to the President, Congress and the Secretary of
Education.  Additionally,  Winterton  served  as  the  deputy  assistant  secretary  for  vo-
cational and adult education in the United States Department of Education and was

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  WILLIAM  J.  VALDEZ,  DIRECTOR,  OFFICE
OF  WORKFORCE  DEVELOPMENT  FOR  TEACHERS  AND  SCI-
ENTISTS, OFFICE OF SCIENCE, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Mr.  VALDEZ.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Ehlers,  thank

you for inviting me to testify at this important hearing.

I  have  submitted  written  testimony  that  makes  three  points.
First, federal S&T mission agencies, such as the Department of En-
ergy, have enormous resources that could be devoted to STEM edu-
cation  and  workforce  development.  Those  resources  naturally  com-
plement  what  is  offered  by  the  Department  of  Education  and  the
National Science Foundation. We are developing partnerships with
other  federal  agencies,  NSF,  the  Department  of  Education,  and
other organizations that have a strong interest in STEM education,
as  a  way  to  leverage  our  resources  within  the  Department  of  En-
ergy.

Second,  the  Office  I  manage,  Workforce  Development  for  Teach-
ers  and  Scientists,  has  a  great  deal  of  work  to  do  in  the  area  of
program  evaluation.  We  are  in  the  process  of  developing  a  com-
prehensive  and  rigorous  evaluation  program  that  builds  upon  the
recommendations  of  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council,  and
what experts told this committee at the May 15 hearing.

Third,  my  Office  is  engaged  in  an  extensive  planning  process
that is leading to a reprioritization of our programs to meet today’s
challenges in STEM education and workforce development. We are
now developing business plans for all of our programs that describe
their goals, resource requirements, and connection to the DOE mis-
sion.

These  three  points  are  discussed  in  more  detail  in  my  written
testimony,  and  I  welcome  an  opportunity  to  answer  any  questions
you might have about them. But I would like to take a moment to
discuss  one  of  the  questions  that  you  asked  in  your  May  29  letter
of  invitation  to  this  hearing.  What  do  you  recommend  as  the  most
effective role your agency can play in improving STEM literacy?

I  have  had  literally  dozens  of  conversations  with  experts  in  the
field on this question, including most of my colleagues at this table,
and  just  in  the  past  two  weeks  with  Frank  Owens  of  the  National
Science  Teachers  Association,  Sally  Shuler  of  the  National  Science
Resource Center, and Iris Weiss of Horizon Research, who testified
at this hearing on May 15. The conversations I had with these ex-
perts,  who  I  consider  to  be  among  the  thought  leaders  in  STEM
education in the United States, have led me to the following obser-
vations.

All three agreed that DOE programs, which emphasize experien-
tial  learning,  hands-on  opportunities  for  students  and  educators,
and rigorously designed programs at our National Laboratories, fill
a  critical  void  in  STEM  education  and  workforce  development.  Iris
Weiss,  for  example,  said  that  DOE  needs  to  provide  an  authentic
research experience well beyond the brief cookbook experience that
students  and  educators  tend  to  get  even  at  the  undergraduate
level.  Students  and  educators  learn  by  doing.  We  provide  them
with  an  opportunity  at  our  National  Laboratories  to  learn  with
some  of  the  best  mentor  scientists  in  the  world,  but,  and  this  is  a
very big caution, our programs must be properly designed to maxi-
mize  their  effectiveness.  This  is  why  we  are  developing  business
plans  for  all  of  our  programs,  and  will  have  those  plans  reviewed
by outside experts. Our program design must be open, transparent,
and  conform  with  the  best  standards  known  to  the  STEM  edu-
cation  community.  Iris  Weiss  asked  me  if  we  really  would  take
their  suggestions  and  criticisms  to  heart,  and  my  answer  was,  ‘‘Of
course.’’

All  three  experts  were  firm  in  their  belief  that  we  must  find  a
way  to  sustain  our  programs,  and  link  them  to  what  matters  to
educators and students. Frank Owens suggested that DOE partner
with  NSTA  to  help  develop  voluntary  national  science  certification
standards  for  educators.  This  would  take  two  forms:  first,  making
a  structured  laboratory  research  experience  part  of  the  voluntary
national  certification  standards  that  NSTA  is  developing;  and  sec-
ond,  utilizing  DOE’s  world-class  scientific  talent  to  partner  with
NSTA to develop their online science content modules.

NSTA  will  propose  a  partnership  structure  to  accomplish  this
with  the  Department  of  Energy.  Iris  Weiss  suggested  that  we  also
work  with  the  Council  of  State  Science  Supervisors  and  other
groups,  which  we  will  do.  Finally,  every  expert  we  have  spoken
with  has  said  that  we  must  carefully  evaluate  our  programs.  Iris
Weiss  and  Sally  Shuler,  who  really  know  this  business  inside  and
out,  agree  that  we  currently  are  only  able  to  measure  improve-
ments  to  content  knowledge  and  interest  in  pursuing  a  science  ca-
reer  after  participation  in  the  kinds  of  experiential  learning  pro-
grams  that  we  manage,  but  we  currently  cannot  measure  whether
those  increases  lead  to  improved  test  scores  and  an  ability  to  per-
form science. I am very interested in talking with NSF and my col-
leagues at the table and other experts about ways to fill these gaps
in knowledge and improve our program evaluation.

Overall,  all  three  experts  agree  that  federal  S&T  agencies  need
to  do  a  better  job  of  talking  with  one  another,  sharing  best  prac-
tices,  and  leveraging  resources.  They  expressed  enormous  frustra-
tion  that  we  don’t  have  a  ‘‘one-stop  shopping’’  resource  for  pro-
grams,  evaluation  techniques,  and  outreach.  Even  the  simple
things, such as a common application for K–12 educators who want
to enter into a research experience, would be a big help, they said.
The  series  of  hearings  that  this  committee  is  holding  should  help
in that regard.

I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and other Members of
the  Committee,  for  investing  your  time  and  energy  into  studying
this  challenge.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  your  staff,
and answering any questions you might have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Valdez follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM J. VALDEZ

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, for this opportunity
to  discuss  the  role  that  the  Department  of  Energy’s  (DOE)  Office  of  Science  plays
in scientific and technical workforce development and education. We appreciate your
strong  commitment  to  improving  science  and  math  education  and  training  in  the
United States.

The  Office  of  Science  is  the  Federal  Government’s  largest  supporter  of  civilian
basic  research  in  the  physical  sciences.  This  basic  research  supports  the  Depart-
ment’s  missions  in  energy,  the  environment,  and  national  security.  The  Office  of
Science manages 10 national laboratories and more than 30 major scientific user fa-
cilities that provide the scientific community with state-of-the-art research tools that
help  accomplish  the  Department’s  goals  and  maintain  U.S.  competitiveness  in
science and technology.

The  Department’s  most  significant  contribution  to  the  development  of  a  scientific
and  technical  workforce  has  been  through  the  support  of  graduate  students  pur-
suing advanced degrees, post-doctoral students who work on research projects, and,
to  a  much  smaller  degree,  hands-on  research  opportunities  for  undergraduate  stu-
dents  and  K–12  educators  and  informal  experiential  learning  opportunities  for  K–
12 students. These individuals utilize DOE research facilities and work side-by-side
with the scientific and technical staff at the national laboratories.

Those  national  laboratories  are  unique  settings  for  research,  mentoring,  and  col-
laboration.  Through  structured  and  unstructured  workforce  development  and
science education programs at DOE’s 17 national laboratories, the power authorities
and other DOE facilities, the Department engages with more than 250,000 students
of all ages and 19,000 K–12 educators on an annual basis.

The  Office  of  Workforce  Development  for  Teachers  and  Scientists  (WDTS),  which
I  manage,  is  the  only  program  office  in  DOE  that  has  a  specific  mission  in  science,
technology,  engineering  and  mathematics  (STEM)  workforce  development  and  edu-
cation. Our programs reach 600 undergraduate students, 16,000 K–12 students, and
150  K–12  educators  annually.  We  do  this  with  an  $8  million  annual  budget  and
under  specific  statutory  authority  (Public  Laws  93–438  and  101–510,  and  most  re-
cently the Energy Policy Act of 2005).

The 17 DOE national laboratories, the power authorities and other DOE facilities
use  WDTS  funding  as  ‘‘seed  money’’  to  develop  complementary  programs  that  are
designed  to  meet  their  local  needs.  Our  programmatic  philosophy  is  ‘‘nationally  de-
signed  programs,  locally  delivered.’’  This  model  has  relied  on  partnerships  within
the Department of Energy and with external organizations.

While  WDTS  directly  funds  600  undergraduate  students  for  summer  internships,
the  total  number  of  undergraduate  research  interns  at  all  of  the  DOE  laboratories
is  4,100.  Similarly,  WDTS  directly  funds  150  K–12  educators,  but  a  total  of  19,300
K–12 educators are involved in programs at DOE laboratories and facilities.

Partnerships enable WDTS to coordinate with and leverage the resources and ca-
pacity of the Office of Science (SC). SC works with more than 300 of the top univer-
sities  in  the  Nation,  manages  10  of  the  biggest  national  laboratories  in  the  Federal
Government, and deals directly with hundreds of high technology companies.

In  recognition  of  widespread  concern  about  STEM  workforce  development,  the
Secretary of Energy, in 2006, commissioned a review by the Secretary of Energy Ad-
visory  Board  of  the  Department’s  activities  in  STEM  education.  That  review  con-
cluded that DOE has a clear role in STEM education and that partnerships are the
primary vehicle we should use to achieve our goals. The Board stated:

‘‘[A] review of the Department’s educational programs as well as a review of the
educational  efforts  in  other  federal  agencies,  leads  us  to  our  conclusion  that
DOE  has  a  significant  opportunity  to  enhance  STEM  education  in  the  Nation.
Moreover,  it  is  clear  from  our  review  (as  well  as  from  the  GAO  reports)  that
the  educational  activities  of  DOE  and  other  federal  agencies  could  benefit  from
increased  cooperative  activities  with  one  another,  with  industry,  with  colleges
and  universities,  and  with  science  teachers’  professional  organizations.  In  both
nationwide  influence  and  in  cooperative  partnerships,  DOE  is  already  posi-
tioned to take a leadership role. DOE’s national laboratories are geographically
distributed  over  the  country,  allowing  access  to  teachers  across  the  Nation.
Moreover, the network of national laboratories is also tightly linked with indus-
trial  and  academic  resources,  giving  DOE  the  ability  to  forge  educational  part-
nerships  that  can  extend  its  reach,  and  therefore  also  its  capacity  to  enhance
STEM education nationwide.’’

As a result of its stakeholder meetings and other outreach efforts, WDTS has had
discussions with a wide range of organizations proposing partnerships. Let me give
you four examples of partnerships that could make our programs more effective:

• WDTS  has  an  existing  partnership  with  the  National  Science  Foundation
(NSF) that illustrates how federal resources can be effectively leveraged. DOE
has  the  17  national  laboratories,  but  NSF  has  greater  access  to  under-
graduate  and  educator  populations.  Our  agreement  with  NSF  enables  us  to
share programs, with a result that in FY 2006 NSF supported 195 educators
and students at seven of our national laboratories. (Table 1)

This  is  a  beginning,  but  we  could  do  more.  DOE  mentor  scientists  who  par-
ticipate  in  Office  of  Science  and  other  DOE  programs  have  a  long  history  of
working  with  students,  and  many  have  indicated  they  are  eager  to  expand
their  efforts.  One  resource  that  could  help  is  the  federal  laboratory  system.
The  Federal  Government  owns  more  than  250  national  laboratories  across
the  Nation,  and  many  of  these  have  STEM  workforce  needs  similar  to  those
of DOE. Thus, WDTS could partner with USDA labs, for example, to prepare
the future workforce to support the expanding bio-fuels industry, or with De-
partment  of  Defense  laboratories  to  develop  our  national  security  workforce.
• WDTS is engaged in extensive discussions with the Department of Education
on  better  support  for  the  Administration’s  Adjunct  Teacher  Corps  initiative.
The mentor scientists at DOE’s national laboratories could constitute a prom-
ising  potential  core  of  the  Adjunct  Teacher  Corps.  Sandia  National  Labora-
tories,  which  is  part  of  the  National  Nuclear  Security  Administration  within
DOE,  is  taking  a  leadership  role  with  WDTS  to  structure  a  program  that
would enable us to work with the Department of Education to achieve the Ad-
ministration’s  goal  of  placing  30,000  adjunct  teachers  in  the  Nation’s  class-
rooms  by  2015.  If  Sandia’s  pilot  program  with  the  Department  of  Education
is successful, the concept could be expanded to other federal agencies with na-
tional laboratories and pools of mentor scientists.
Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings on May 9, 2007 commented on this
emerging  partnership:  ‘‘When  I  was  in  Senator  [Jeff]  Bingaman’s  state  of
New  Mexico  I  visited  a  local  high  school  where  scientists  from  Sandia  Labs
were  teaching  chemistry.  We  need  to  make  this  the  norm  around  the  coun-
try.’’
• The core element of WDTS’s programs and other programs carried out at the
DOE laboratories is providing educators and students with hands-on research
experience.  These  research  experiences  supplement  what  students  learn  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

214

the  classroom  and  help  educators  better  understand  the  process  of  science.
Thus,  we  want  to  partner  with  organizations  like  universities  and  corporate
laboratories that have similar infrastructure to that of the DOE national lab-
oratories.  As  a  start,  we  have  entered  into  discussions  with  a  university  and
a  major  non-profit  science  educational  group  in  Boston  about  pilot  programs
that would share resources and capabilities.

• WDTS  is  developing  what  we  are  calling  a  ‘‘trusted  partners’’  approach  to
reach  under-represented  populations.  Students  and  educators  tend  to  learn
about our programs primarily through recommendations from individuals and
organizations  whose  opinions  the  students  and  educators  themselves  trust.
This  is  particularly  true  of  students  and  educators  from  under-represented
populations  who  have  not  built  a  trust  relationship  with  the  Department  of
Energy. As a result, we are exploring partnerships with several national orga-
nizations to help identify their most promising students and educators for our
programs. We have had discussions, for example, with a major Hispanic com-
munications  network  about  developing  innovative  approaches  that  reach  the
best and brightest Hispanic students and teachers for our programs.

Evaluation

I  would  now  like  to  turn  to  the  need  for  evaluation  and  intelligent  program  de-

sign.

In this regard, I would like to commend the Department of Education and the Of-
fice  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB)  for  the  work  they  have  done  through  the
Academic  Competitiveness  Council  (ACC).  The  catalogue  of  existing  STEM  edu-
cation  programs  in  the  Federal  Government  and  the  emphasis  the  ACC  Report
places  on  the  need  for  rigorous  evaluation  catalyzed  a  discussion  in  Washington,
D.C.  policy  circles  about  the  need  for  rigorous  evaluation  of  STEM  education  and
workforce programs.

The  ACC  Report’s  recommendations  were  influential  in  the  development  of
WDTS’s  future  direction.  This  was  a  discussion  that  was  much  needed  because,
frankly,  WDTS  has  done  a  poor  job  over  the  past  10  years  of  rigorously  evaluating
our  programs.  As  a  result,  and  under  the  specific  direction  of  Under  Secretary  for
Science Raymond Orbach, we are committed to improving our ability to evaluate the
impact and effectiveness of our programs.

We  have  data  that  indicate  our  experiential  learning  programs  are  yielding  good
results (i.e., promoting interest in STEM fields). We are in the process of developing
a  plan  for  more  rigorous  study  of  the  program  that  will  enable  us  to  demonstrate
the  program’s  impact.  Based  on  the  results,  we  will  be  able  to  refine  the  program
and pursue the most effective strategies going forward.

One lesson that was reinforced by the ACC process is that evaluation and assess-
ment are crucial to the effective design of STEM workforce programs. For example,
during the 1980s and 1990s, the Department funded rigorous longitudinal workforce
studies  that  enabled  program  managers  to  identify  specific  future  workforce  needs.
WDTS is in the process of re-invigorating that effort and within the next 12 months
will  have  completed  a  pilot  workforce  study  that  identifies  the  workforce  needs,  by
scientific  discipline,  for  the  Office  of  Science  federal  and  national  laboratory  staff.
This workforce study is being done in collaboration with the National Nuclear Se-
curity  Administration  (NNSA).  By  including  the  10  national  laboratories  managed
by  the  Office  of  Science  and  the  three  defense  national  laboratories  managed  by
NNSA  (Lawrence  Livermore  National  Laboratory,  Sandia  National  Laboratories,
and Los Alamos National Laboratory) in the study, we will account for the majority
of the R&D performed by the Department. In future years, we hope to include other
DOE laboratories and R&D programs in this effort.
Identifying gaps

Rigorous evaluation of programs and the use of workforce data from the analysis
that we will do over the next 12 months will enable WDTS to identify opportunities
to improve our STEM workforce development and education efforts.

WDTS  currently  manages  nine  programs  for  students  and  educators.  Those  pro-
grams  emphasize  experiential  learning  opportunities  for  students  and  educators,
such  as  the  Academies  Creating  Teacher  Scientists  (ACTS)  program;  and  world
class  celebrations  of  scientific  achievement  for  students,  such  as  the  National
Science Bowl. We have two decades of experience managing these types of programs
and believe that they are effective and are contributing to our nation’s efforts to im-
prove  STEM  education  and  proficiency,  although  more  rigorous  evaluations  are  in
order.

But  conversations  with  our  stakeholders  and  our  own  internal  analysis  have  re-
vealed  that  there  are  opportunities  for  our  programs  to  better  achieve  their  objec-
tives. Let me give you two examples:

• One  potential  gap  is  in  the  development  of  talent  in  our  federal  workforce.
While  one  of  our  goals  is  to  encourage  students  to  join  federal  service,  we  do
not have programs in place that provide a clear link for them to seek employ-
ment  with  the  Department,  such  as  helping  them  navigate  the  difficult  fed-
eral  hiring  process.  In  addition,  we  do  not  have  the  workforce  assessment
tools  in  place  that  would  inform  us  about  whether  we  need  more  physicists,
chemists,  or  engineers.  The  workforce  assessment  we  are  doing  will  help  in
that  regard.  We  are  also  working  with  DOE’s  Chief  Human  Capital  Officer,
Dr.  Jeff  Pon,  to  develop  programs  specifically  targeted  at  the  federal  STEM
workforce.
• Another  area  for  improvement  is  our  collective  need  to  better  align  agency
STEM efforts with larger federal mission needs. Representatives from various
federal  agencies  have  emphasized  the  need  to  work  collaboratively  to  solve
our mutual STEM education and workforce challenges. One result is that my
colleague,  Dr.  Joyce  Winterton  of  NASA,  has  taken  the  initiative  to  form  a
brown bag lunch group of federal science and technology agencies as a forum
for  discussion  and  collaboration.  I  am  also  talking  with  the  Federal  Labora-
tory  Consortium,  the  Triangle  Coalition  and  a  host  of  other  groups  about
partnerships designed to bring federal agencies together with the educational
community and industry. We need to work together and, in fact, a grassroots
process supported by federal S&T agencies has already begun.

Conclusion:

I would like to conclude by highlighting several statistics:

agencies

• $135  billion—the  annual  federal  investment  in  R&D  that  is  managed  by  34
• 257—federal  laboratories  that  belong  to  the  Federal  Laboratory  Consortium
• 206,000—federal scientists and engineers (not including contractors)

and are active in communities nationwide

When  all  of  these  numbers  are  put  together,  it  is  evident  that  we  have  excellent
resources  for  a  coordinated  federal  response  to  the  Nation’s  STEM  education  chal-
lenge.

The 34 federal R&D mission agencies—such as NASA, NOAA, DOD, NIH, USDA
and  EPA—have  a  long-term  and  enduring  interest  in  their  workforces  and  STEM
education. This has been a strong federal resource that can continue to support our
efforts to address the national challenge of educating the future U.S. workforce and
helping to prepare our citizens for the emerging era of scientific discovery and inno-
vation.

Thank you for offering me this opportunity to provide a perspective on this impor-

tant issue. I look forward to answering the Committee’s questions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR WILLIAM J. VALDEZ

Bill  Valdez  is  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Workforce  Development  for  Teachers
and Scientists within the Department of Energy’s Office of Science. His responsibil-
ities  include  developing  workforce  strategies  for  the  Department’s  scientific  and
technical  workforce,  and  creating  opportunities  for  students  and  educators  to  par-
ticipate  in  the  Nation’s  research  enterprise  as  a  means  to  improving  the  competi-
tiveness of U.S. industry and overall scientific literacy.

In addition, Mr. Valdez has been leading an interagency effort, coordinated by the
White  House  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  that  is  designed  to  establish
credible  outcome  measures  for  basic  research,  create  new  evaluation  methods  that
focus  on  systems  level  analysis,  and  promote  business  models  that  will  enable  fed-
eral R&D managers to improve investment decisions.

Previously,  Mr.  Valdez  was  the  Director  of  Planning  and  Analysis  at  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science.  His  responsibilities  included  corporate  strategic
planning, R&D evaluation, and federal S&T policy development.

Mr. Valdez was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advance-
ment  of  Science  in  2006  and  is  Vice  Chair  of  the  Senior  Executive  Association’s
Board of Directors. He was elected to the Board of Directors of the Senior Executive
Association in 2005.

Mr.  Valdez  has  held  various  positions  at  the  Department  of  Energy  since  1994,
including  serving  as  Executive  Director  of  the  DOE  R&D  Council  and  developing

evaluation  techniques  for  technology  transfer  programs.  Mr.  Valdez  also  served  at
the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from 1998–99. His respon-
sibilities included co-authoring a report on strategies designed to improve the future
scientific  workforce  as  the  Nation’s  demographics  change,  developing  interagency
technology initiatives, and advising on international energy initiatives.

Prior to working at DOE, Mr. Valdez worked as a Senior Project Manager in pri-
vate industry where he provided strategic planning services to Asian and European
multi-national corporations.

Mr. Valdez received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Texas and his Mas-
ter  of  Arts  in  International  Economics  and  Energy  Policy  from  the  Johns  Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you, Mr. Valdez. Dr. Fuchs.
STATEMENT OF DR. BRUCE A. FUCHS, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF

SCIENCE EDUCATION, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH
Dr.  FUCHS.  Thank  you,  Chairman  McNerney  and  Congressman
Ehlers. I want to thank you for this invitation to appear before you
to discuss some of NIH’s STEM programs. It is an honor for me to
appear  before  this  subcommittee  that  has  worked  so  hard  to  im-
prove STEM education in this nation.

I  will  apologize  for  the  PowerPoint.  I  am  an  old  professor,  and
old  habits  are  hard  to  break.  I  would  like  to  briefly  discuss  some
of  the  things  that  I  believe  federal  agencies  can  do  to  help  with
STEM education in this country. First, we can partner with outside
agencies and experts to design exemplary model programs for a va-
riety  of  things,  instructional  materials,  teacher  professional  devel-
opment, and then rigorously evaluate those programs. It is not that
every agency should get involved in each activity, but I think every
agency  can  select  something  to  do  well.  We  need  to  know  what
works,  what  doesn’t,  and  most  importantly,  why.  This  kind  of  in-
depth  design  and  evaluation  research  is  unlikely  to  come  either
from states or private industry working alone.

Second,  I  believe  that  the  responsible  federal  agencies,  and  this
is  primarily  NSF,  Department  of  Education,  and  NIH  through  its
National  Institute  on  Child  Health  and  Development,  need  to  sup-
port  high-quality,  scientifically  based  education  research.  Unfortu-
nately, we have scientific evidence to support only a small number
of  items  related  to  math  and  science  teaching  that  we  didn’t  know
25 years ago. We must not be in the same situation 25 years from
now.

Lastly,  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  federal  scientists,  because  of
their  many  interactions  with  students  and  scientists  from  around
the world, have an important insight into what it takes to compete
in  today’s  world.  This  insight  should  be  used  to  help  define  the
world-class  standards  to  which  our  schools  must  aspire.  Sadly,
many  of  our  states’  science  and  math  standards  cannot  presently
be considered to be world-class.

I would like to tell you briefly about two programs that we have
at the NIH, and illustrate how they are working with educators in
the states. The first is a grants program known as the Science Edu-
cation Partnership Award. This is a peer-reviewed program located
within NIH’s National Center for Research Resources. These grants
are  used  to  establish  partnerships  within  a  community  to  enhance
the  teaching  of  science  within  that  community.  For  example,  a
partnership might be developed between a university and a science
museum,  or  a  university  and  a  school  district.  There  are  currently

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

217

70  active  SEPA  grants  in  39  states,  a  number  of  which  focus  on
underserved populations within those communities.

The  second  program  I  would  like  to  highlight  is  the  NIH  Cur-
riculum Supplement Series. I must say that I agree with the testi-
mony that you received last month relating to how difficult it is to
develop  high-quality  instructional  materials.  This  is  a  time-con-
suming  and  an  expensive  process.  I  believe  that  we  have  avoided
the  pitfalls  described  by  forming  appropriate  partnerships.  In
short,  we  know  what  we  know,  and  we  know  what  we  don’t  know.
We have been able to combine the scientific insights of some of the
world’s  leading  scientists,  people  like  Dr.  Anthony  Fauci  and  Dr.
Francis Collins, with the professional expertise of some of the most
highly  respected  curriculum  development  organizations  in  this
country.

We  are  currently  engaged  in  aligning  our  supplements  to  the
science,  math,  health,  and  language  arts  standards  for  each  state.
We  have  included,  in  an  online  appendix,  a  sample  of  alignments
for  a  number  of  sample  states,  and  I  have  included  for  Committee
Members  some  examples  of  curriculum  supplements  for  you  to  re-
view.  We  believe  that  this  project  is  one  way  that  we  can  bring
some  of  the  excitement,  hope,  and  promise  of  NIH  research  to
schools around the Nation. But they won’t help if they don’t get out
there, so I would like to close with a brief discussion of dissemina-
tion.

We have worked very hard to let educators know about the avail-
ability of our now 16 different curriculum supplements aimed at el-
ementary, middle, and high school. At the end of May, we had had
requests  from  more  than  70,000  teachers  from  across  the  country,
for  almost  285,000  supplement  titles.  In  the  online  appendix,  I
have  included  maps  showing  the  number  and  location  of  these  re-
quests  for  some  sample  states.  I  think  if  you,  each  of  you,  would
look  at  your  home  state,  as  I  do,  you  can  look  simply  from  the  re-
quests, and identify various towns.

I don’t have time to show you all these state maps, but I can give
you,  show  you  a  national  map  that  gives  you  a  sense  of  this.  This
map  places  one  blue  dot  in  each  zip  code  from  which  we  have  re-
ceived  one  or  more  requests  for  an  NIH  curriculum  supplement.
Each  blue  dot  could  represent  one  curriculum  supplement  or  hun-
dreds, but the map does give you a good sense of where the orders
have come from.

The  next  map  is  actually  a  NOAA  satellite  image  of  the  U.S.  at
night,  with  lights  showing  approximately  the  population  distribu-
tion across the U.S. Now, if I can successfully toggle this back and
forth, I will give you some sense of how well we have done at find-
ing  people  where  they  live  and  connecting  them  with  our  cur-
riculum supplement project.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to discuss a few of our
STEM  programs.  I  will  be  happy  to  answer  any  of  the  questions
that the Committee Members might have.

STEM education efforts at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

The  mission  of  the  NIH  is  to  uncover  new  knowledge  that  will  lead  to  better
health for everyone. NIH has long been involved in directing programs for the collec-
tion,  dissemination,  and  exchange  of  information  in  medicine  and  health,  including
the development and support of medical libraries and the training of medical librar-
ians  and  other  health  information  specialists.  In  1991,  the  NIH  formed  an  Office
of  Science  Education  Policy  (now  the  Office  of  Science  Education  under  the  Office
of  Science  Policy)  in  the  Office  of  the  Director  because  of  concerns  surrounding  the
state of science education in the Nation.

The  NIH  Office  of  Science  Education  (OSE)  coordinates  a  program  to  strengthen
and enhance efforts of the NIH to attract young people to biomedical and behavioral
science  careers  and  to  improve  science  literacy  in  both  adults  and  children.  The
function  of  the  OSE  is  to:  1)  develop,  support,  and  direct  program  activities  at  all
levels,  with  special  emphasis  on  targeting  students  in  grades  kindergarten  to  16,
their  educators  and  parents,  and  the  general  public;  2)  advise  NIH  leadership  on
science  education  issues;  3)  examine  and  evaluate  research  and  emerging  trends  in
science education and literacy for policy-making; 4) work closely with the NIH extra-
mural,  intramural,  women’s  health,  laboratory  animal  research,  and  minority  pro-
gram offices on science education special issues and programs to ensure coordination
of NIH efforts; 5) work with NIH Institutes and Centers to enhance communication
of science education activities; and 6) work cooperatively with other public- and pri-
vate-sector organizations to develop and coordinate activities.

NIH  contributes  to  K–16  STEM  education  in  three  main  ways:  1)  by  partnering
with  educators  on  high-quality  model  programs  to  create  instructional  materials,
conduct teacher professional development, and support informal science education in
museums  and  science  centers;  2)  by  conducting  rigorous  research  into  science  and
mathematics  learning  and  teaching  through  NIH’s  National  Institute  of  Child
Health  and  Human  Development  (NICHD);  and  3)  because  of  its  interactions  with
scientists and students from around the world, by helping to understand the ‘‘world
class standards’’ our students will need to compete in today’s world.
1a. What  steps  has  your  agency  taken  to  improve  its  coordination  with

other federal agencies’ STEM education activities?

NIH  was  actively  engaged  in  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  (ACC)  delib-
erations. NIH Director Elias Zerhouni joined the ACC at the invitation of Secretary
Spellings  and  made  clear  his  support  for  the  process.  NIH  participated  in  all  three
ACC  working  groups:  K–12,  Graduate/Postgraduate,  and  Outreach  and  Informal
Education.

Dr.  Zerhouni  has  also  committed  NIH  to  a  leadership  role  on  the  new  National
Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)  Subcommittee  on  STEM  Education  that
will  follow  through  on  the  ACC  recommendations.  Dr.  Zerhouni  appointed  Dr.
Duane  Alexander,  NICHD  Director,  to  serve  as  one  of  the  co-chairs  of  the  sub-
committee, along with Dr. Cora Marrett, National Science Foundation, and Dr. Russ
Whitehurst, Department of Education.

Additionally,  the  NIH  is  in  discussions  with  the  Department  of  Defense  and  the
National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA)  about  ways  to  extend  the
ACC  database  (ACC  Recommendation  #1).  By  expanding  the  program  database  to
include  project-level  information,  federal  program  managers  with  shared  interests
(e.g.,  teacher  professional  development)  would  be  able  to  find  one  another  in  order
to share information.
1b. To  what  extent  does  your  agency  collaborate  with  educators  in  the

states and school districts in developing STEM education programs?

Some of the resources that teachers request from the NIH were not originally tar-
geted  for  classroom  use.  Most  of  the  large  number  of  publications  created  by  NIH
are  directed  to  specific  health  conditions  or  are  directed  at  specific  audiences,  such
as  patients,  family  members,  and  health  care  professionals.  However,  once  these
publications were discovered by science teachers, they began to be requested for use
in classrooms as well. (Two popular examples are of this type of publication are In-
side the Cell, available at http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/insidethecell/, and Un-
derstanding  the  Immune  System,  at  http://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/im-
mune/the¥immune¥system.pdf.)

However,  today  the  majority  of  NIH  programs  and  resources  requested  by  edu-
cators  were  created  expressly  for,  and  with,  teachers.  Below  are  two  examples  of
NIH resources currently available to science educators.

First,  the  NIH  National  Center  for  Research  Resources  Science  Education  Part-
nership  Award  (SEPA)  Grant  Program  is  the  largest  single  K–12  (and  informal)

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

additional

information 

about  SEPA, 

science education program at NIH. SEPA’s goals are: 1) to stimulate career opportu-
nities  in  basic  science  and  clinical  research  by  providing  inquiry-based  curricula  to
K–12 students, teachers, and parents; and 2) through SEPA projects at science cen-
ters and museums, to increase the public’s understanding of NIH-funded medical re-
search  and  to  provide  information  about  healthy  life  style  choices.  Because  these
awards  are  made  to  a  community  organization,  the  projects  can  be  specifically  de-
signed to meet the needs of that community. For examples of SEPA-funded projects
in  selected  States,  see  Appendix  A  at  http://science.education.nih.gov/HSTC,  and
for 
http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/
science¥education¥partnership¥awards/.

Second,  OSE  has  collaborated  with  a  number  of  NIH  Institutes  and  Centers  to
create  a  series  of  free  curriculum  supplements  (currently  16  titles)  for  science  edu-
cators  (available  at  http://science.education.nih.gov/supplements).  Teachers  have
input  into  the  development,  writing,  and  editing  of  each  supplement.  The  supple-
ments  are  field-tested  by  teachers  across  the  Nation  and  modified  to  address  their
concerns  before  being  released  to  the  public.  Our  state-level  collaborations  have  in-
cluded working with state departments of education and state-wide education advo-
cacy groups (in New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Missouri, and Tennessee) to deter-
mine whether a supplement meets a need in the state-wide science curriculum and
to help with state health education standards development. The North Carolina De-
partment  of  Public  Instruction  has  recommended  one  of  the  NIH  supplements  as  a
primary  resource  for  their  eighth-grade  science  teachers  since  2005.  (http://
www.dpi.state.nc.us/docs/curriculum/science/middlegrades/8thsciencesupport.pdf.)
2. The  recent  report  of  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  reinforces
the  need  for  better  evaluation  and  performance  metrics  for  federal
STEM  education  programs.  What  plans  does  your  agency  have  for  im-
provements in its evaluation of its STEM programs?
NIH  supports  the  ACC  goal  of  conducting  increasingly  rigorous  evaluations  of  its
STEM  education  activities  using  multiple  evaluation  strategies.  These  strategies
will  include  working  toward  conducting  randomized  controlled  trials  where  appro-
priate.

NIH  has  agreed  to  align  its  goals  and  metrics  to  those  defined  through  the  ACC
process.  The  first  NIH-wide  meeting  of  K–12  project  directors  was  held  in  April
2007 to discuss this alignment as well as ways to begin collaborating on increasingly
rigorous evaluations.

The  science  education  grants  programs  at  NIH  (for  example,  SEPA  grants)  are
currently  considering  changes  in  their  funding  opportunity  announcements  to  re-
quire  increasingly  rigorous  project  evaluations.  While  this  process  will  take  some
time,  OSE  is  committed  to  helping  the  community  (extramural  grantees  and  NIH
intramural  project  managers)  solve  the  problems  it  may  encounter  on  the  road  to
rigorous evaluations.
3. The  Subcommittee  received  testimony  at  a  hearing  on  15  May  on  how
the R&D mission agencies could improve the effectiveness of their STEM
education  programs.  The  witnesses  were  skeptical  of  the  ability  of  the
agencies  to  develop  curricular  materials  for  formal  classroom  instruc-
tion and questioned the effectiveness of their teacher professional devel-
opment programs to improve teacher classroom performance, while sug-
gesting that the agencies’ most important role is in informal STEM edu-
cation.  The  witnesses  also  strongly  recommend  closer  collaboration  by
the  agencies  with  educators  in  the  field  when  developing  STEM  pro-
grams.  What  is  your  response  to  the  recommendations  from  these  wit-
nesses?
Several witnesses expressed concerns at the May 15 hearing regarding the poten-
tial  pitfalls  related  to  developing  curricular  materials  for  formal  classroom  instruc-
tion.  Mr.  Michael  Lach  made  comments  about  the  problems  of  ‘‘adding  more  topics
to  cover’’  and  of  parochial  projects’  being  ‘‘harder  to  connect  to  our  work’’  in  terms
of  curriculum  materials.  Dr.  Nelson  noted,  ‘‘There  is  a  huge  inventory  of  poorly  de-
signed and under-evaluated mission-related curricula (posters and lesson plans and
associated professional development) rarely used in classrooms and with no natural
home  in  a  coherent  standards-based  curriculum.  Effective  curriculum  development
requires  a  deep  collaboration  with  a  team  of  professional  curriculum  developers,
education researchers, and classroom teachers.’’

We  could  not  agree  more.  Development  of  high-quality  instructional  materials  is
a difficult, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking. It is true that well-meaning
scientists have unwittingly added to Dr. Nelson’s ‘‘huge inventory of poorly designed
and  under-evaluated’’  curricula.  We  believe  that  OSE  has  avoided  these  pitfalls  by

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

220

proceeding  slowly,  doing  our  homework,  understanding  where  we  have  expertise,
and, most importantly, understanding where we do not have expertise.

Before starting the NIH Curriculum Supplements Series, we conducted nearly two
years  of  research,  discussions,  and  interviews  with  leading  curriculum  developers
across the U.S. We also conducted focus groups with educators at a number of con-
ferences around the Nation to determine whether there was interest in having NIH
create  supplemental  materials  for  the  classroom.  (There  was.)  We  discussed  with
educators the topic areas where they felt they needed help and how these might be
fit  into  biology  courses.  Interestingly,  the  teachers  also  strongly  warned  us  ‘‘not  to
let our scientists write the curricula,’’ advice that we took to heart.

When  considering  what  NIH  can  bring  to  the  creation  of  supplemental  instruc-
tional  materials,  it  is  important  to  note  that  our  employees  include  some  of  the
world’s  leading  scientific  minds.  Dr.  Anthony  Fauci,  Director  of  the  National  Insti-
tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the Na-
tional  Human  Genome  Research  Institute,  are  only  two  such  individuals  who  have
contributed their scientific understanding and foresight to the NIH Curriculum Sup-
plements  Series.  However,  while  NIH  has  this  kind  of  scientific  expertise  in  abun-
dance, we do not have in-house expertise in instructional materials development.

Instead,  we  have  sought  out  professional  curriculum  development  organizations
that are as well known and respected in their field of expertise as NIH is in its own.
We  have  contracted  with  BSCS  (Biological  Sciences  Curriculum  Study)  and  EDC
(Educational Development Corporation), two of the most highly respected science in-
structional  materials  developers  in  the  Nation.  Both  of  these  organizations  rely  on
research  into  how  children  learn  science,  use  professional  curriculum  developers,
and  depend  on  classroom  teachers  as  advisors,  writers,  and  field-testers.  Both  of
these organizations trace their genesis back to the early post-Sputnik days and have
established long track records of creating innovative and effective curricula.

NIH  curriculum  supplements  were  designed  from  the  start  to  align  with  the  Na-
tional  Science  Education  Standards  (NSES).  Most  States  have  used  the  NSES  to
create  their  own  standards  documents.  Since  implementation  of  the  No  Child  Left
Behind  Act,  alignment  to  the  NSES  is  no  longer  sufficient.  As  a  result,  we  are  un-
dertaking  the  task  of  aligning  each  of  our  16  curriculum  supplement  titles  to  each
state’s science, mathematics, health, and language arts standards (34 States and the
District  of  Columbia  are  done 
see  Appendix  B  at  http://
science.education.nih.gov/HSTC for samples of alignments of one supplement to se-
lected States). When this project is complete, we will be able to demonstrate for each
state  how  a  specific  NIH  curriculum  supplement  directly  addresses  the  science  and
cross-curricular content standards that educators are expected to cover.

Many  educators  have  reported  being  especially  excited  to  receive  materials  that
can  transmit  some  of  the  thrill  and  sense  of  discovery  arising  from  the  latest  NIH
research as a way to inspire and motivate their students. Each supplement provides
activities  for  students  to  investigate  science  content  knowledge  they  can  apply  di-
rectly  to  some  aspect  of  their  daily  lives.  The  fact  that  the  materials  cover  the  bio-
logical  concepts  that  teachers  are  required  to  cover  but  do  it  through  references  to
human health and disease is seen as a strong positive. For instance, in general, chil-
dren  do  not  get  very  excited  by  studying  onion  root  tips.  It  is  far  more  engaging
to study the mechanisms that control cell growth by relating it to a human disease
like cancer.

In creating these instructional materials, we were also motivated by the fact that
research into the poor performance of our students in international comparisons has
concluded  that  curricula  in  the  U.S.  are  ‘‘a  mile  wide  and  an  inch  deep’’  and  that
content  is  often  years  out  of  date.  The  American  Association  for  the  Advancement
of  Science  Project  2061  has  evaluated  many  middle  and  high  school  science  text-
books  and  found  all  of  them  wanting.  None  of  the  10  evaluated  high  school  biology
textbooks  received  even  a  ‘‘good’’  rating.  We  were  convinced  that  teachers  would
benefit from free, accurate, interesting, standards-based instructional materials that
incorporate  the  latest  research  into  how  people  learn,  so  we  developed  curriculum
supplements  that  allow  students  to  think  like  present-day  researchers  and  engage
in practical applications.

The extent to which we have created a curriculum series that is of interest to edu-
cators is indicated by the fact that as of late May 2007, more than 70,000 educators
have requested almost 285,000 supplements across the Nation. We would like to em-
phasize that each of these supplements has been shipped out in response to a specific
request  for  that  title  coming  in  from  an  educator.  In  other  words,  each  of  these  re-
quests is a record of a positive action taken by an educator to come to our website,
fill  out  a  post  card,  send  us  an  e-mail,  etc.  (See  Appendix  C  at  http://
science.education.nih.gov/HSTC for distribution maps showing how many, and from
where, requests have come for selected States.)

so 

far; 

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

221

We are also proud to report that NIH curriculum supplements are frequently used
as  exemplary  instructional  resources  by  university-based  professors  engaged  in
teaching  future  science  teachers  in  ‘‘methods’’  courses.  The  middle  school  supple-
ment  Doing  Science:  The  Process  of  Scientific  Inquiry  has  been  especially  well  re-
ceived by this audience. To our knowledge, very few other entities have created edu-
cational materials that are deemed so useful that they are requested both by STEM
teachers and by the university-based professors who train them.

We  created  the  NIH  curriculum  supplements  as  models  for  how  challenging  con-
tent can be combined with engaging, realistic situations to give students the oppor-
tunity to think like scientists. For a report on how the instructional model underpin-
ning the NIH curriculum supplements aligns with current research into how people
learn, see Appendix D at http://science.education.nih.gov/HSTC.

Last,  although  we  share  an  enthusiasm  for  informal  science  education,  we  are
concerned  by  the  inequities  that  would  result  if  it  were  our  only  approach.  Many
educators, particularly those in small, rural, or impoverished urban school districts,
cannot afford a field trip to a science center or museum, nor is every school district
within driving distance of a museum, major university, or federal laboratory instal-
lation. We must not forget those teachers and students who cannot, for financial or
other  reasons,  travel  to  a  wonderful  science  museum,  or  have  a  scientist  visit  the
classroom.  These  teachers  and  students  also  deserve  to  have  access  to  high-quality
science experiences.

I  would  like  to  illustrate  this  last  point  with  a  personal  anecdote.  I  was  one  of
those  rare  individuals  who  knew  from  early  childhood  that  he  wanted  to  be  a  sci-
entist.  Undoubtedly,  this  was  due,  at  least  in  part,  to  the  post-Sputnik  efforts  that
allowed  my  parents  to  order  me  pictures  of  astronauts,  rockets,  and  stars  from
NASA. However, living where I did in central Illinois, I was a senior in high school
before  I  got  to  meet  my  first  working  scientist—after  a  four-hour  bus  ride  to  Ar-
gonne  National  Laboratory.  We  have  designed  the  NIH  curriculum  supplements  to
bring  some  of  the  excitement,  promise,  and  hope  of  NIH  research  to  any  school—
urban or rural, rich or poor, with the best laboratory facilities or none at all.
4. How does your agency determine priorities for its K–16 STEM education
portfolio?  Has  your  agency’s  balance  of  programs  at  graduate/post  doc-
toral,  undergraduate,  K–12,  and  informal  education  changed  much  over
the  past  few  years?  Do  you  foresee  a  change  in  that  balance  in  the  fu-
ture?
Approximately  95  percent  of  the  education  activities  (in  dollar  terms)  that  NIH
submitted to the ACC inventory fell into the ‘‘Graduate/Postgraduate’’ category. NIH
has no plans to change that balance.

In  the  future,  this  priority  setting  will  be  more  formal  and  coordinated.  As  pre-
viously  mentioned,  NIH  has  agreed  to  align  its  goals  and  metrics  to  those  defined
through the ACC process. The first NIH-wide meeting of K–12 project directors was
held  in  April  2007  to  discuss  this  alignment  as  well  as  ways  to  begin  collaborating
on increasingly rigorous evaluations.
5. How  does  your  agency  disseminate  information  about  its  STEM  edu-
cation  programs?  What  organizations,  both  government  and  private,
have you partnered with to reach educators in the field?
OSE  has  created  a  web  site  specifically  designed  to  help  educators  find  NIH  re-
sources  that  meet  their  needs  (http://science.education.nih.gov).  We  also  responded
to input from teachers regarding the ways that they search for materials (for exam-
ple,  by  topic,  by  grade  level,  by  resource  format).  As  OSE  identifies  new  NIH  re-
sources, it codes them using this scheme to facilitate easy retrieval by teachers.

Shortly  before  our  last  web  site  redesign,  we  began  using  the  evaluation  services
of  the  American  Consumer  Satisfaction  Index  (ACSI),  which  publishes  an  e-govern-
ment  Satisfaction  Index.  ACSI  is  a  cross-industry  measure  of  consumers’  satisfac-
tion.  It  measures  the  performance  of  over  200  private-sector  companies  as  well  as
many government agencies, using scores calculated on data gathered from voluntary
online  surveys  of  randomly  selected  site  visitors.  For  the  past  few  years,  the  OSE
web  site  has  been  one  of  the  top  10  sites  in  the  entire  government  in  terms  of  cus-
tomer satisfaction.

Since  March  2000,  site  traffic  has  increased  from  17,000  visitor  sessions  per
month  to  well  over  250,000  visitor  sessions  per  month.  Web  pages  viewed  each
month have increased over the same time period from 36,000 to almost 2.5 million.
For  the  past  two  years,  OSE  coordinated  an  ‘‘NIH  Research  Zone’’  at  National
Science Teachers Association (NSTA) national conferences. This year, eight NIH In-
stitutes and Centers joined OSE, along with the Society for Neuroscience and other
organizations.  This  effort  has  been  greatly  appreciated  by  the  NSTA  members.

NSTA President Linda Froschauer cited it as a good example of how NSTA benefits
from  interactions  with  federal  agencies  in  her  May  15,  2007,  testimony  before  this
committee. OSE also attends the National Association of Biology Teachers meetings,
the  National  Middle  School  Association  meetings,  and,  on  occasion,  state  meetings
of science teachers.

Thank you for this opportunity to discuss NIH’s STEM education efforts with you.

I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR BRUCE A. FUCHS

Dr. Bruce A. Fuchs is currently the Director of the National Institutes of Health’s
(NIH)  Office  of  Science  Education  (OSE).  Dr.  Fuchs  is  responsible  for  monitoring  a
range of science education policy issues and providing advice to NIH leadership. He
also  directs  the  creation  of  a  series  of  K–12  science  education  curriculum  supple-
ments that highlight the medical research findings of the NIH. The NIH Curriculum
Supplement Series is designed to meet teacher’s educational goals as outlined in the
National  Science  Education  Standards  and  is  available  free  to  teachers  across  the
Nation. The office also actively creates innovative science and career education web
resources,  such  as  the  LifeWorks  career  exploration  site,  accessible  to  teachers  and
students  across 
resources  are  available  at  http://
science.education.nih.gov.

the  Nation.  These 

Dr.  Fuchs  is  serving  on  the  Education  and  Workforce  Development  Working
Group of the National Science and Technology Council and on working groups of the
Department of Education’s Academic Competitiveness Council. He was a member of
the K–12 education focus group for the National Academy of Science’s report Rising
Above the Gathering Storm, which was utilized in the Administration’s development
of the American Competitiveness Initiative, which President Bush introduced in his
2006  State  of  the  Union  address.  In  2005,  the  Department  of  Education  asked  Dr.
Fuchs to serve as the U.S. representative to the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation
meeting  on  Best  Practices  in  Math  and  Science  Education.  For  a  number  of  years,
Dr.  Fuchs  was  the  NIH  representative  to  the  Department  of  Education’s  National
Education  Research  Policy  and  Priorities  Board.  That  experience  led  to  his  con-
tinuing interest in the debate over how to make educational research more effective.
Before  coming  to  NIH,  Dr.  Fuchs—an  immunologist  who  did  research  on  the
interaction between the brain and the immune system—was a researcher and teach-
er on the faculty of the Medical College of Virginia. He had grant support from both
NIH’s  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  and  the  National  Institute  on  Drug
Abuse.  He  has  a  B.S.  in  Biology  from  the  University  of  Illinois  and  a  Ph.D.  in  Im-
munology from Indiana State University. He was born and raised in Springfield, Il-
linois.

DISCUSSION

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Fuchs.  And  I  want  to  thank  all
the  witnesses  for  making  the  effort.  I  know  it  is  a  challenge  to
come  over  here  and  prepare  yourselves  and  all,  and  sit  in  front  of
this committee, so it is very good testimony.

At  this  point,  we  will  open  our  first  round  of  questions,  and  the
Chair  recognizes  himself  for  approximately  five  minutes,  or  maybe
a little bit longer.

I  think  the  purpose  of  this  hearing  is  really  to  give  this  com-
mittee comfort in what is about to happen in STEM education, and
I  see  it  as  this  committee’s—that  is  about  to  be  formed,  or  is  al-
ready  formed—responsibility  to  make  sure  that  this  is  executed  in
a  way  that  takes  advantage  of  the  resources  that  are  available.  I
think it is a large responsibility, so I applaud, again, all of you for
wanting to participate.

I  see  Dr.  Marrett  as  the  leader  of  this  effort,  rightly  or  wrongly,
and  so  I  am  going  to  be  picking  on  you  a  little  bit  more  than  the
others perhaps, but there is no malicious intent here. Will the sub-
committee  be  developing  a  strategic  plan  for  federal  STEM  edu-

cation programs to help guide the priorities of the agencies? Is that
something you see a part of your charter?

Dr.  MARRETT.  Yes,  I  do.  This  is  an  important  question,  because
we are, at this point, developing the charter for the committee. And
as I see it, yes, there has got to be, we must undertake some activi-
ties  that  will  strengthen,  enhance  what  is  taking  place  with  agen-
cies,  that  will  recognize  some  of  the  distinctiveness,  but  will  also
work towards the level of coordination that is going to be expected.
When  you  ask,  then,  should  there  be  some  impact,  some  sense
of  what  the  impact  should  be,  we  will  certainly  be  looking  for  how
to think about the entire enterprise, and what is the role of the in-
dividual  agencies  within  that?  I  am  saying  this,  expressing  to  you
our desire to have any suggestions, any questions and ideas, as we
develop both the charter and the set of activities.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Well,  will  you  be  developing  an  annual  plan,
then,  or  some  sort  of  an  organization  chart  that  we  can  look  at?  I
know that prior to this meeting, the ACC report had catalogued the
way that money is being spent in K–12 education. That is very im-
portant,  I  think  that  is,  in  some  sense,  the  relatively  easy  part  of
this task. We can find out where we are through a certain amount
of  research,  and  we  can  determine  what  our  plans  are.  The  real
hard  part  is  evaluating  what  we  are  going  to  get  once  we  start
doing  it,  and  I  was  appreciating  Dr.  Winterton’s  discussion  of  how
some  programs  had  worked,  and  they  were  exciting,  and  the  kids
got involved.

It  would  be  nice  to  have  that  sort  of  thing,  not  codified,  but  in
some sort of description that people can refer to in a way that will
be  helpful.  But  then  again,  the  question  of  evaluation,  I  think  Dr.
Valdez  mentioned  that  we  can  evaluate  programs  after  they  are
done,  but  the  problem  is  that  we  need  sort  of  a  feedback  mecha-
nism,  so  that  when  a  program  is  in  progress,  we  can  tell  if  it  is
working  or  not.  So,  the  evaluation  is  really  the  most  difficult  as-
pect, in my opinion, here. So, can we have a comment, Dr. Marrett?
Dr.  MARRETT.  Several  comments.  I  will  try  to  keep  them  brief.
One of the things that you also heard during the testimony is the
imperative  for  enhanced  research,  STEM  education  research,  un-
derstanding  a  lot  more  of  what  works,  under  what  conditions,  for
whom, and through what processes. Since we know we have got to
enhance  that  a  lot  more,  and  I  am  very  encouraged  when  I  hear
my colleagues indicate what that will mean. That will have to play
into the plans for evaluation.

So,  on  the  one  hand,  we  will  be  proceeding,  building  on  the
knowledge that does exist about evaluation, having those conversa-
tions  of  what  are  the  appropriate  kinds  of  measures,  of  indicators.
How do we develop indicators that would be common enough across
the  agencies?  We  will  do  that,  but  we  won’t,  I  won’t  promise  that
we  will  have  everything  on  an  annual  basis  at  the  beginning,  just
because there are these very thorny but important questions about
how do we build the knowledge base, the knowledge base that will
be  so  important  for  the  way  the  evaluation  activities  will  have  to
take place.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Well,  I  like  the  sound  of  using  the  scientific
method in evaluating this scientific education, but honestly, that is
going  to  be  our  challenge.  How  do  we  know  when  we  are  suc-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

224

ceeding? How do we make sure that the program is organized well?
I think it is going to be important to see that plan to move forward.
Mr.  Valdez,  a  question,  if  I  have  time.  I  understand  that  you
have  been  developing  a  strategic  plan  for  the  Department  of  En-
ergy  education  programs,  to  ensure  that  they  align  with  STEM
workforce  needs  for  the  future.  Would  you  tell  the  subcommittee
the  process  you  underwent  to  determine  those  educational  needs,
and  how  you  used  that  information  to  create  your  strategic  plan?
Mr.  VALDEZ.  Yes,  the  strategic  plan,  as  most  strategic  plans,  is
based  on  what  our  stakeholders  think  we  should  be  doing,  and
aligning  that  to  the  mission  of  the  Department  of  Energy.  So,  for
example, we had a series of nine focus groups, involving 110 stake-
holders,  everything  from  the  educational  community  to  corporate
America,  to  groups  representing  underrepresented  populations,  in
a  very  structured  way,  talking  about  how  the  Department  of  En-
ergy,  which  is  a  mission  agency,  could  participate  in  STEM  edu-
cation and workforce development.

And  I  think  this  gets  to  the  heart  of  what  this  hearing  is  all
about. Why would an agency like the Department of Energy be in-
volved in this? And the reason is because we care about our future
workforce.  We  support  specific  disciplines  and  specific  areas  of  in-
dustrial  competitiveness  that  are  important  to  the  Nation,  and  as
a  result,  we  have  to  work  with  the  educational  community  at  all
levels, not just K–12, but undergraduate, postdoc, graduate school,
and then continuing lifelong learning.

So,  we  developed  a  process  where  we  brought  in  members  of  all
those  communities,  to  help  us  rationalize  the  resources  that  we
have  within  the  Department  of  Energy,  to  more  effectively  use
them.  And  frankly,  our  most  effective  use  is  through  the  National
Laboratories.  You,  Mr.  Chairman,  were  at  Sandia  National  Labs,
and  you  know  that  these  National  Laboratories  are  embedded  in
the  communities.  They  work  with  local  school  districts.  They  are
the  experts;  and  so,  we  deliver  our  products  and  services  through
them,  and  we  try  to  align  the  strategic  plan  in  a  way  that  makes
full and maximum use of our National Laboratories.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Valdez.  The  Chair  now  recog-

nizes Dr. Ehlers for five minutes.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First  of  all,  Dr.  Fuchs,  you  mentioned  as  an  old  professor,  you
felt  compelled  to  use  PowerPoint.  Let  me  point  out,  as  a  younger
professor, that I think you did the right thing. I have read a num-
ber of these articles about how terrible it is to use PowerPoint, and
we  shouldn’t  use  them  so  much,  et  cetera.  I  have  decided  all  of
those  are  written  by  people  who  don’t  know  how  to  prepare  good
slides.

Dr.  Marrett,  first  question  for  you.  You  described,  you  are  going
to  reconstitute  the  NSTC,  the  National  Science  and  Technology
Council’s Subcommittee on Education and Workforce Development,
for which I applaud you. It should never have been disbanded. You
described  the  necessary  qualifications  as  knowledge  and  experi-
ence.

So,  would  it  also  be  helpful  for  you,  in  that  process,  to  ensure
that  a  minimum  level  of  experience,  or  maybe  the  better  word  is
stature  within  their  agency,  their  seniority  or  whatever,  be  re-

225

quired, so that you can ensure that the appropriate individuals will
be  at  the  NSTC’s  disposal  through  this  means?  And  I  think  you
know  what  I  am  getting  at.  I  have  nothing  against  junior  per-
sonnel. They usually have the best ideas, but you need some upper
level  people  there  to  really  make  sure  that  this  gets  carried  out,
and that when someone on your subcommittee goes back home, and
says well, we really should do this, that you don’t have some other
person  there  who  frowns  and  says,  well,  we  really  don’t  have  the
money in the budget. But what is your response?

Dr.  MARRETT.  My  response  is  that  the  way  this  is  being  set  up
is  through  the  Committee  on  Science.  The  Committee  on  Science
consists  of  the  principals  from  the  agencies.  Hence,  when  we  have
asked for their nominees, the assumption is that whatever the level
of  the  person,  that  person  will  have  direct  access  to  the  top  of  the
agency.  You  are  quite  right  that  it  will  be  very  important  that
there  will  be  access  to  the  centers  of  communication,  to  funding,
but  this  is  what  we  anticipate  the  direct,  the  process  should  help
enhance that.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay.  I  hope  you  are  right.  You  may  want  to  build

something into the structure to ensure that.

Next  question,  I  know  what  the  ranking  of  the  budgets  of  the
agencies  are.  Obviously,  Dr.  Fuchs,  you  have  the  richest  agency,
and  then,  we  go  down  to  NASA,  then  Energy,  and  then,  finally,
NSF. And we could have lots of arguments of how it should be. But
I am curious how much is spent on education in each of your agen-
cies.  And  we  will  go  right  to  left,  and  ask  Dr.  Fuchs,  what  does
NIH spend on these educational issues? What is your budget?

Dr.  FUCHS.  I  believe  we  submitted  to  the  ACC  around  $800  mil-
lion  worth  of  activity,  and  that  would  have  been  in  the  year  when
our total budget was about $28 billion.

Mr. EHLERS. Yeah. Okay.
Dr.  FUCHS.  The  majority,  95  percent  of  that,  was  actually  grad-

uate, postgraduate activity.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. And how much, any estimate how much is K–

12?

Dr.  FUCHS.  We  submitted  $36  million  worth  of  K–12  activities,

and about $6 million worth of informal education.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. Mr. Valdez.
Mr.  VALDEZ.  My  Office  has  a  budget  of  $8  million  per  year.
Through  appropriated  funds,  we  think  the  Department  spends
about  $20  to  $25  million  per  year  on  educational  activities;  and
then,  through  the  National  Laboratories,  both  through  overhead,
other  kinds  of  activities,  partnerships  with  industry  and  other
groups,  there  is  probably  about  another  $30  million  that  is  spent
by the National Laboratories. So that is a total of about $50 to $60
million.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay.  And  Dr.  Winterton,  I  know  NASA  spends  a

huge amount of money on educational activities. What is yours?

Dr.  WINTERTON.  Well,  we  do  spend  on  education,  in  various
places within NASA, so within the Office of Education, we plan on
spending  about  spending  about  $153  million.  Then,  we  also  have
each  of  our  Mission  Directorates,  who  also  invest  in  education,  be-
cause it ties, again, directly back to their missions.

Mr. EHLERS. Right.

226

Dr.  WINTERTON.  So,  for  the  Science  Mission,  it  is  about  $72  mil-
lion, for Explorations, $4.8, Aeronautics, $2.8, and our Space Oper-
ation Mission Directorate spends and supports activities directly of
the  centers,  so  if  you  want  those  specifics,  I  can  provide  that  as
well, so——

Mr.  EHLERS.  I  think  this  gives  me  a  general  idea.  And  finally,

Dr. Marrett, what is——

Dr. MARRETT. Yes. For NSF, across the board, it is nearly $1 bil-
lion, but this includes what is spent inside the Directorate for Edu-
cation and Human Resources, as well as outside. So the Directorate
itself  has  a  budget  of  just  over  $700  million,  but  this  is  where  I
would again indicate that there are efforts, every part of the Foun-
dation  has  education  outreach  public  service  activities  that  relate
to education, and so, it comes to about nearly $1 billion.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay.  That  is  very  helpful.  It  gives  me  some  per-
spective,  and  I  may  have  to  speak  to  Dr.  Bodman  or  Mr.  Rohr-
abacher about pumping up your budget, Mr. Valdez. I really appre-
ciate what you have done. I have encountered, in my experience in
the schools, the K–12 schools, products of what you have done, and
I think it is outstanding.

The one part that bothers me, which I have tried to correct legis-
latively,  but  so  far  have  not  had  enough  support,  is  the  inability
of  teachers  to  locate  what  they  may  want  or  need  at  a  particular
time,  and  so  what  I  have  advocated  is  a  clearinghouse,  where  all
of the programs that you have available for schools would be listed,
and  this  would  be  on  a  website,  and  any  teacher  who  wanted  to
could  access  that,  if  they  had  a  particular  unit  they  were  working
on,  and  wanted  to  just  look  at  what  was  available,  that  teacher
could go on the website, type that in, the units would be displayed.
And  I  really  advocate  an  Amazon.com  type  of  approach,  where
teachers  who  have  used  something  would  then  evaluate,  and  just
write a short evaluative statement, give a ranking from one to four,
and this would be very useful. I hope that we can get that passed,
because  I  think  that  would  be  immensely  useful  to  the  teachers,
and would give much greater exposure to what you have done and
what you have solved.

With that, I yield back.
Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Ehlers.  The  Chair  now  recog-

nizes my good friend and mentor from Illinois, Mr. Lipinski.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  would  like  to  thank
all  of  the  witnesses  for  their  testimony  today,  and  the  work  that
they are doing. I don’t know if there is anything really more impor-
tant  in  ensuring  America’s  future  than  to  improve  our  STEM  edu-
cation.  I  think  it  is  very  critical  for  our  country.  I  have  a  degree
in mechanical engineering, and I always point to, and many people
have  heard  this  now,  my  physics  teacher  when  I  was  a  junior  in
high school, who really is the one who inspired me to go ahead and
go  to  college  and  major  in  mechanical  engineering,  really  got  me
interested and excited in studying engineering.

A couple of things that I wanted to ask about. First, Dr. Marrett,
the  new  NSTC  Subcommittee  on  STEM  Education  is  a  sub-
committee  of  the  NSTC  Committee  on  Science.  Do  you  think  that
this is a sufficiently high level organization to get the agencies’ at-

227

tention,  or  do  you  think  there  should  be  something  at  a  higher
level than that?

Dr.  MARRETT.  I  am  quite  willing  to  try  it  at  the  level  where  it
is.  There  was,  in  fact,  a  previous  committee  that  did  exist.  The
charter  expired  in  last  December,  and  so,  it  is  not  as  if  this  is  a
brand  new  activity,  and  my  colleagues,  who  were  involved  before,
will  know  that  we  have  some  items  that  should  come  onto  that
agenda. I know there has been this question of what should be the
level.  I  think  that  we  can  be  effective  when  there  is  the  level  of
conversation that is needed, the planning, wherever, as long as, as
Chairman  McNerney  indicated,  there  is  the  strong  connection  to
the  top  of  agencies  and  to  the  conversations  that  must  take  place
across and within agencies. But I am not bothered by the fact that
this  is  being  structured  as  a  subcommittee  of  the  Committee  on
Science.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Now,  back  in  November,  I  spoke  to  the  National
Science Board. They were in Chicago meeting, talking about STEM
education,  and  right  now,  we  are  awaiting  their  report  and  rec-
ommendation  on  what  to  do  on  STEM  education.  I  understand  it
has been delayed now, until August.

Dr. Marrett, or if any other witnesses have any, do you have any
ideas about what is going to be coming out of this, or where do you
see this going?

Dr.  MARRETT.  Well,  let  me  first  thank  you  very  much  for  the
presentation that you made, and in fact, I heard that it was an im-
pressive  set  of  comments  that  you  gave.  The  National  Science
Board  Committee  is  in  the  process  of  redrafting  the  report.  That
is why I am not sure my colleagues have seen what is still, for now,
an internal document for the National Science Board, thus it would
be difficult for me to describe where everything is likely to lead, ex-
cept that I would say it, again, is likely to reinforce the imperative
for  our  coordinated  efforts,  for  our  heightened  attention  for  what
must  take  place.  So,  to  that  extent,  I  see  it  as  responding  to  and
helping to clarify many of the issues this committee has dealt with,
as well as the several reports that people have referred to.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Well,  I  am  very  much  looking  forward  to  seeing
that, as I know all of us are. In my last bit of time here, I wanted
to  ask  Mr.  Valdez  about  some  of  the  programs  that  are  going  on
with the DOE labs in helping with STEM education. I have talked
to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, who is working
and  has  more  plans  to  work  with  Argonne  National  Lab,  to  try  to
bring  students  down  to  the  Museum  to  really  get  them  interested,
excited about these various areas.

Now,  a  couple  things  that  you  talked  about  in  your  testimony.
First,  you  describe  activities  that  support  K–12  teachers  who  are
involved in research activities at the National Labs. Has there been
an  evaluation  that  DOE  has  done  about  the  effectiveness  of  doing
this?

Mr.  VALDEZ.  We  have  not  done  a  specific  evaluation  of  that  pro-
gram.  It  is  a  relatively  new  program.  It  is  a  three  year  program.
The first cadre of teachers completed their participation in the pro-
gram just this past summer, and we have been developing the eval-
uation  techniques  that  will  enable  us  to  track  what  happens  to
them  after  they  finish  the  program,  and  what  they  have  learned

through  the  program.  So,  it  is  too  soon  to  say  whether  or  not  we
have evaluated it right.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Well, I definitely want to support that. I think that
is  something  we  should  be  doing  more  of,  and  also,  in  addition,
something  you  talked  about  was  that  Sandia  National  Lab,  if  the
Chair will indulge me to ask one last question here, at Sandia Na-
tional Lab, you mentioned how there is a pilot program for the Ad-
ministration’s  Adjunct  Teacher  Corps  Initiative.  Can  you  explain
how this works?

Mr.  VALDEZ.  Well,  the  Adjunct  Teacher  Corps  has  a  goal  of  put-
ting  30,000  adjunct  teachers  into  classrooms  by  the  year  2012  or
2013,  I  forget  which  one,  and  the  Department  of  Education  came
to  the  Department  of  Energy  and  said,  ‘‘We  don’t  have  the  ability
to  recruit  adjunct  teachers  the  way  that  you  do,’’  because  adjunct
teachers would come from industry, National Laboratories, working
scientists,  retired  scientists.  We  were  very  excited  about  working
with  them,  and  Sandia  stepped  up  to  the  plate,  and  decided  they
would  pilot  the  concept.  And  so,  over  the  next  fiscal  year,  we  are
going  to  take  a  look  at  what  Sandia  does,  and  then  see  if  we  can
model  this  to  the  other  17  National  Laboratories  in  the  DOE  sys-
tem.

I think that illustrates what we do at the Department of Energy.
We  work,  we  design  programs  nationally,  but  we  implement  them
locally  through  the  National  Laboratories,  and  through  our  other
partners.  And  if  you  do  that,  even  though  our  budget  is  small,  Dr.
Ehlers—and I do appreciate your voice of support for this—the fact
of  the  matter  is  we  reach  a  lot  of  people.  You  know,  through  our
National Laboratories, we touch 250,000 K–12 students every year,
and  19,000  K–12  educators.  The  National  Laboratories  use  the
money that we have at Department of Energy headquarters as seed
money to then go out and work with industry, local school districts,
and everybody else, to implement the programs, and it is a very ef-
fective model, and one that I think could be useful for other federal
agencies.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Lipinski.  I  believe  the  Com-
mittee was interested in another round of questions, so I will recog-
nize myself for another five minutes.

Dr. Marrett, will the subcommittee develop and maintain a cata-
logue  of  the  federal  STEM  education  programs,  as  the  ACC  did?  I
think  that  is  important,  at  least  having  a  quantifiable,  a  really
quantifiable  way  to  understand  the  connection  and  how  money  is
being spent, whether there is overlap, waste, and so on.

Dr.  MARRETT.  Because  the  committee  is  still  being  put  together,
I  have  to  hesitate  to  answer  some  questions  about  what  the  com-
mittee  will  do,  but  this  one,  I  can  be  confident  about,  because  we
have  already  had  the  conversations  that  said  yes,  the  ACC  report
had,  of  course,  had  recommended  this  kind  of  continued  compen-
dium  of  programs,  and  that  will  be  done.  So,  that  part  is  going  to
certainly be continued, as related to the ACC process.

I  think  it  is  likely,  too,  that  we  will  come  back  to  an  issue  that
had  been  on  the  table  earlier,  and  that  is  trying  to  understand
what the very concepts mean in the programs. As my colleague Dr.
Fuchs  has  said,  that  sometimes  the  term  that  is  used  to  describe

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

229

a  program  need  not  mean  the  same  thing  from  one  place  to  an-
other. So, as we try to develop a useful compendium of what takes
place,  that  will  mean  looking  very  much  at  how  the  programs  are
defined  to  develop  something  that  will  be  across  the  agencies,  too,
on that front. But yes, we will be a source of trying to provide that
information about what takes place.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  What  about  priorities?  How  are  we  going  to  go
ahead,  or  how  is  the  committee  going  to  go  ahead  and  determine
what the priorities are, in terms of resource usage?

Dr.  MARRETT.  I  am  a  bit  hesitant  to  answer  that  one,  on  behalf
of  all  of  my  colleagues  from  the  committee  yet  to  be  established.
I think I would say with some level of confidence we certainly will
be  looking  at  matters  of  priorities,  paying  attention  to  a  lot  of  the
information  that  is  already  around  about  what  the  Nation’s  needs
are for now and into the future, this cannot be just looking at what
might  have  been  appropriate  some  20  years  ago,  but  exactly  how
those will evolve is to be determined, through a process that we in-
tend  to  be  as  engaging  and  engaged  as  possible.  For  that,  I  would
say we would welcome any observations you might have.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Well,  it  was  interesting  to  hear  Dr.  Winterton’s
testimony,  because  she  was  talking  about  inspiring  kids,  and  that
is  critically  important,  because  no  matter  how  many  resources  we
offer,  if  the  generation  doesn’t  accept  the  offer  and  get  engaged  in
the  process,  then  we  are  not  going  to  get  as  far  as  we  need  to  get.
And I see some of our national challenges as being a tool for get-
ting  kids  engaged,  the  threat  of  global  warming,  for  example,  a
great national and international threat that cannot only show chal-
lenge, in terms of risk, and the fear that that might bring, but also,
the  opportunity  for  intellectual  achievement,  for  financial  success,
and  so  on.  So  some  of  these  great  national  challenges  ought  to  be
involved in some way, if we can get that as a part of the program.
I don’t know exactly how, but perhaps Dr. Valdez, you have, or Dr.
Winterton, have a comment on that?

Dr.  WINTERTON.  I  think,  especially,  as  we  have  the  opportunity
to engage faculty and students directly with our scientists, through
our science missions, or through our space exploration, so students
see the real world application, and we provide mentorship, so even
in  high  school,  students  are  working  at  Goddard  Spaceflight  Cen-
ter, and actually doing research with our scientists.

So, I think it is that really, understanding, you really have to be
very  good,  not  only  when  you  work  in  our  labs,  but  when  you  are
working on the International Space Station, with international col-
leagues,  that  they  really  apply  themselves  in  their  math  and  their
science classes, that they start seeing a career for them within the
aerospace  industry,  and  understand  that  it  is  a  great  opportunity,
that they see the kind of skills they need, and the competencies to
be there.

Mr. VALDEZ. I am a big fan of prioritizing things, and I think you
need to go back to what are the core capabilities and the core mis-
sions of the federal agencies, and in the case of the federal mission
agencies, I think it really comes down to two things.

First, we need to be supportive of the workforce and the missions
that we have been entrusted to us by the Congress and by the U.S.
taxpayer.  And  so,  for  the  Department  of  Energy,  it  is  support  for

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

230

energy, environment, national security, and basic discovery science.
And  that  helps  inform  what  kinds  of  programs  we  should  have  for
STEM education and STEM workforce.

And  then,  we  have  a  larger  responsibility  through  the  American
Competitiveness Initiative, to support STEM education and literacy
in  general.  And  I  think  this  is  where  your  notion,  Mr.  Chairman,
of having students become excited about science plays in, and agen-
cies  are  uniquely  placed  to  have  students  become  excited,  whether
it  is  by  going  to  a  DOE  National  Laboratory,  and  seeing  the  Ad-
vanced  Photon  Source,  or  riding  the  National  Oceanographic  and
Atmospheric Administration’s ship, you know, an Antarctic ship.

I  mean,  there  are  ways  that  we  can  do  this,  but  we  need  to  set
those  priorities,  and  rationalize  the  resources  in  the  appropriate
way.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Well,  I  agree  with  the  idea,  but  that  only
reaches a fairly small segment of the population, I mean, in terms
of  children  in  inner  city  schools,  I  mean,  they  are  not  going  to  get
out to the labs. We need to find a way to reach out and show them
the  national  need,  the  national  priority,  and  the  need  for  them  to
get engaged for our nation’s future, and that is something that the
Committee might consider in its future debates.

Dr. MARRETT. Well, I would say that the Committee will need to
look at a number of options, because what is also been represented
a bit here, and even more so, with some of our agencies not at the
table, is that we work to enhance the level of excitement, the moti-
vation, through a number of informal processes, through the activi-
ties  with  Boy  Scouts,  for  example,  with  community  groups.  One  is
not  constrained  to  the  very  formal  kinds  of  settings,  and  that  is
where  we  are  also  very  interested  in  what  is  appropriate  for  the
other  kinds  of  settings,  because  we  do  not  intend  to  leave  behind
segments  of  the  population  we  know  that  must  be  important  for
where the Nation moves.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Well, my time has expired. I am going to recog-

nize Mr. Ehlers.

Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First  of  all,  let  me  just  make  a  comment,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have
been through many hearings over the years, and I have been work-
ing  on  improving  math,  science  education  in  the  K–12  system  for
close to 50 years now, but especially in the last 14, in the Congress.
This  is  the  biggest  and  best  audience  we  have  ever  had  for  this,
so I think, Mr. Chairman, we are finally getting the word out, and
people are interested in the topic. I find that very heartening.

I  know  that  the  National  Science  Foundation  declares  education
and  public  outreach  as  part  of  research  proposals  that  are  sub-
mitted. Is that common in your other agencies as well, when inves-
tigators submit a request for proposal? Do they have to also include
a  statement  about  the  educational  aspects  that  will  come  out  of
that?

Dr.  FUCHS.  It  is  not  a  feature  in  the  NIH.  It  was  considered  for
a while back in the 1990s, under the previous Director, and the de-
cision  was  not  to  make  that  similar  requirement,  so  we  don’t  have
that.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. Mr. Valdez.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

Mr.  VALDEZ.  No,  it  is  not  part  of  the  Department  of  Energy’s

231

grant programs.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. And Dr. Winterton.
Dr.  WINTERTON.  It  is  part  of  our  Science  Mission  Directorate,  so
each of their principal investigators with their science missions are
required  to  do  an  education  and  public  outreach  plan  and  imple-
ment that.

Mr. EHLERS. And the two agencies that do this, is there the pro-
posal  of  how  they  are  going  to  implement  that  education  and  out-
reach?  Is  that  considered  in  deciding  whether  or  not  to  give  the
grant, or is that just sort of an automatic add-on?

Dr. MARRETT. No, for NSF, it is critical for what takes place, be-
cause we have got the criteria of intellectual merit and broader im-
pacts,  and  in  that  context  of  broader  impacts,  this  is  where,  gen-
erally,  the  outreach  efforts,  the  education  activities,  are  to  be  un-
dertaken.  Those,  then,  become  critical  in  the  decisions  made  about
the  awarding  of  grants.  We  wrote  this  process,  trying  to  think  of
some  ways  to  make  sure  that  we  can  evaluate  effectively  the  out-
comes from those efforts.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay.  So,  if  someone  submits  a  proposal  for  an  ex-
periment  to  measure  Einstein’s  effect  in  general  relativity,  that,
the educational part, is considered as well as the scientific part. Is
that true in NASA also, Dr. Winterton?

Dr.  WINTERTON.  It  is  a  really  critical  part  of  their  plan,  and  we
work closely, and offer our assistance in the Office of Education, to
assist  in  educational  outreach  and  dissemination  of  those  opportu-
nities as well.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay. And I would just encourage Energy and NIH
to  consider  doing  the  same  thing.  It  is  a  very  useful  thing.  I  also
just,  Dr.  Winterton,  you  mentioned  something  about  a  mathe-
matical  exercise  relating  to  flying.  Do  you  use  flight  simulators  at
all your programs for the schools?
Dr. WINTERTON. We do have——
Mr. EHLERS. Commercially available flight simulators.
Dr. WINTERTON. We provide those opportunities through our cen-
ters.  Now,  the  type  of  simulation  the  students  were  doing,  and  I
know you are a budding pilot, and you might want to try this simu-
lator,  to  make  sure  we  are  getting  the  right  mission  control  ex-
perts, is——

Mr. EHLERS. I have already flown a Shuttle.
Dr. WINTERTON.—is a computer-based simulation, so that part is

available at any school.

Mr. EHLERS. Yeah.
Dr. WINTERTON. So, we like that combination of affordable, read-
ily  available,  but  you  can  also  go  to  a  center  to  do  the  simulation
as well.

Mr. EHLERS. Okay.
Dr. WINTERTON. And I think through some of our university and
our  space  grants,  that  certainly  is  another  opportunity  to  provide
that in a broader sense.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay.  And  I  can’t  give  commercials,  but  I  am  fas-
cinated  with  the  potentials  of  the  X–Plane  program,  because  it  ac-
tually  allows  students  to  construct  their  own  airplane,  and  you
have to be fairly sophisticated, at least junior high, perhaps higher,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

232

but  it  is  an  incredibly  good  educational  experience,  and  the  pro-
gram  is  $50  or  something  like  that,  so  any  school  could  afford  to
have that.

Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has been an excellent hear-
ing. The only missing component, and I don’t want to criticize, even
though  I  should,  since  I  am  part  of  the  minority,  and  that  is  our
job,  but  there  is  one  other  agency  that  spends  a  huge  amount  of
money  on  K–12  education,  and  that  is  the  Defense  Department.  It
is a smaller fraction of their budget than any of these agencies, but
we might want to hear from them some time, too, about what they
are doing.

And  they,  incidentally,  one  plus  factor  of  the  Defense  Depart-
ment  is  their  Army  Schools,  which  are  located  around  the  world—
I  shouldn’t  say  Army—the  schools  are  for  their  employees’  chil-
dren—consistently  rank  higher  than  the  average  American  school,
particularly in the science and technology, and also, often equal the
countries,  the  record  of  the  countries  that  they  are  in.  So,  obvi-
ously,  the  Defense  Department  is  doing  something  right  in  their
schools,  and  we  might  be  interested  in  talking  to  them  about  that
some time.

With  that,  I  will  conclude,  and  thank  you  again,  Mr.  Chairman,

for having this hearing.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Well, the Chair thanks the Ranking Member for
his  thoughtful  comments,  and  I  think  that  is  something  that  we
would want to move forward with.

And before closing, I would like to thank the witnesses for, again,
spending  their  afternoon,  and  also,  the  members  of  the  audience.
It is a nice day out there, so it is appreciated that you would come
in here to hear our testimony.

And  the  record  will  remain  open  for  additional  questions  that
Subcommittee  Members  may  ask  of  the  witnesses,  so  be  prepared
for that.

And  the  witnesses  are  excused,  and  the  hearing  is  now  ad-

journed.

[Whereupon, at 4:00 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Cora  B.  Marrett,  Assistant  Director,  Education  and  Human  Resources

Directorate, National Science Foundation

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. Dr.  Marrett,  the  new  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)  sub-
committee  on  STEM  education  is  a  subcommittee  of  the  NSTC  Committee  on
Science.  Is  this  of  a  sufficiently  high  level  organizationally  to  get  the  agencies’
attention?  Because  of  the  widely  recognized  importance  of  STEM  education,
shouldn’t this be constituted as a new, independent NSTC committee?

A1. The  membership  of  the  STEM  Education  Subcommittee  has  now  been  estab-
lished.  The  timely  response  from  the  agencies  to  the  request  for  names  and  the  re-
sponsibilities  of  the  persons  designated  suggests  that  the  subcommittee  structure
can  be  effective.  The  persons  selected  to  represent  their  agencies  have  sufficient
oversight for personnel and budgets to act on behalf of their organizations.

There are substantive reasons for an arrangement that connects STEM education
to  the  larger  Committee  on  Science  (COS).  First,  the  agenda  on  STEM  education
must reflect current developments in the wider realm of STEM research and devel-
opment. The connection to the COS, the body charged with the broader world of re-
search  and  development,  helps  ensure  that  the  priorities  for  STEM  education  are
aligned  with  the  directions  at  the  federal  level  of  science,  technology,  engineering,
and  mathematics.  Second,  within  the  agencies  STEM  education  is  integrated  into
and  not  isolated  from  the  objectives  agencies  have  identified  for  science  and  engi-
neering. The subcommittee structure, then replicates the pattern that agencies em-
ploy and have found to be beneficial.

The  structure  does  not  signal  that  the  subcommittee  is  of  secondary  importance
in  the  NSTC  complex.  The  principals  for  the  Committee  on  Science  regard  STEM
education  as  of  profound  significance  for  the  Nation  and  consequently  anticipate
regular  exchanges  about  the  work  of  the  subcommittee.  They,  in  turn,  are  com-
mitted to facilitating and participating in exchanges between the subcommittee and
any  other  relevant  NSTC  bodies.  Likewise,  the  co-chairs  of  the  subcommittee  have
ready  access  to  the  principals  and  aim  to  work  cooperatively  with  them.  In  sum,
then,  the  subcommittee  has  obtained  from  the  agencies  and  the  Committee  on
Science  the  support  it  will  need  to  be  an  effective  force  in  the  pursuit  of  excellence
for education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
Q2. The Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC) has recommended that no funding
should be increased for a STEM education program ‘‘unless a plan for rigorous,
independent evaluation is in place,’’ which is defined in the report as being Ran-
domized Controlled Trials or, when that is not feasible, Well-Matched Compari-
son  Group  Studies.  One  of  our  witnesses  at  the  May  15th  hearing,  Dr.  Weiss,
stated  that  this  approach  would  not  be  practical  for  the  majority  of  programs
in  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies.  I  would  like  to  ask  our  witnesses  to  re-
spond  to  Dr.  Weiss’  opinion.  Is  this  a  practical  way  of  evaluating  programs  at
NASA, Energy, and NIH? What other types of evaluation methods might be bet-
ter suited?

A2. The Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC) report does indeed recommend no
additional  funding  to  STEM  education  programs,  in  the  absence  of  plans  for  rig-
orous,  independent  evaluation.  The  report  points  out,  however,  that  ‘‘no  single  de-
sign  or  evaluation  methodology  is  appropriate  for  all  education  studies,’’  and  ‘‘the
appropriate  methodology  should  be  selected  based  on  the  maturity  of  the  activity’’
(p.  13).  Furthermore,  it  acknowledges  that  programs  can  be  arrayed  along  a  con-
tinuum  that  starts  ‘‘generally  with  small-scale  studies  to  test  new  ideas  and  gen-
erate  hypotheses,  leading  to  increasingly  larger  and  more  rigorous  studies  to  test
the effects of a given intervention or activity on a variety of students and in a vari-
ety  of  settings’’  (p.  13).  Thus,  the  report  does  not  advocate  for  the  premature  use
of experimental or quasi-experimental methods to determine causality. It is also im-
portant to remember as well that the ACC discussion is centered on measuring the
impact  of  an  educational  activity  on  student  outcomes  (p.  15),  not  educational  dif-
ferences at the institutional or system level.

The  National  Science  Foundation  recognizes  the  importance  of  using  randomized
controlled  trials  (RCTs)  to  establish  cause-and-effect  relationships  between  edu-
cation  programs  and  student  outcomes.  As  Dr.  Weiss  stated,  and  the  ACC  report
supports, RCTs and well-matched comparison group studies are not always feasible
and  applicable,  nonetheless.  For  short-term  outreach  efforts  or  efforts  to  enhance

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

235

the institutional structure for STEM education, some activities cannot be standard-
ized and controlled. For projects federal agencies and others undertake, the random-
ized assignment of participants is not always feasible, practical, or ethical. Thus, the
use of RCTs is appropriate depending on the program design and the research ques-
tion.  The  ACC  report  recognizes  this  point;  Dr.  Weiss  sought  especially  to  reinforce
it.

Policy-making  bodies  frequently  draw  on  evidence  from  multi-year  studies  that
use  mixed  methods.  What  seems  significant  for  the  making  of  policy  is  the  rigor  of
the  approach  that  is  taken,  coupled  with  attention  to  the  question  or  problem  that
is central to analysis.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Joyce  L.  Winterton,  Assistant  Administrator,  Office  of  Education,  Na-

tional Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. The Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC) has recommended that no funding
should be increased for a STEM education program ‘‘unless a plan for rigorous,
independent evaluation is in place’’ which is defined in the report as being Ran-
domized Controlled Trials or, when that is not feasible, Well-Matched Compari-
son  Group  Studies.  One  of  our  witnesses  at  the  May  15,  2007,  hearing,  Dr.
Weiss,  stated  that  this  approach  would  not  be  practical  for  the  majority  of  pro-
grams  in  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies.  I  would  like  to  ask  our  witnesses
to respond to Dr. Weiss’ opinion. Is this a practical way of evaluating programs
at  NASA,  Energy,  and  NIH?  What  other  types  of  evaluation  methods  might  be
better suited?

A1. Establishment  of  standards  for  the  evaluation  of  Federal  STEM  education  pro-
grams  was  extensively  discussed  within  the  ACC  working  groups.  A  hierarchy  of
study  designs,  weighted  in  favor  of  a  research-oriented  model  focused  on  Random-
ized  Control  Trials  (RCTs),  was  adopted.  However,  several  concerns  were  raised  by
NASA  and  other  working  group  members.  The  main  concern  is  that  RCTs  are  pri-
marily applicable to interventions, defined broadly by the education evaluation com-
munity, as projects with highly specific features that target a precisely defined audi-
ence  in  order  to  achieve  a  specific  outcome  under  controlled,  standardized  condi-
tions.  There  are  a  variety  of  other  reasons  why  RCT  models  are  not  practical  for
some  of  NASA’s  portfolio,  including:  (a)  schools  are  not  typically  prepared  to  match
control  and  treatment  groups;  (b)  RCTs  are  complex  and  costly  to  properly  imple-
ment;  and,  (c)  some  of  NASA’s  education  projects  are  not  specific  interventions  ac-
cording to the above definition but are instead designed to enhance the capabilities
of the education and outreach community (e.g., the NASA Explorer Institutes project
seeks to enhance the ability of science centers and museums to use NASA’s unique
resources).

NASA  is  in  full  agreement  that  sound,  rigorous  evaluations  should  be  imple-
mented  to  provide  the  best  possible  evidence  of  effectiveness  but  the  methodologies
must  be  appropriate  to  the  program.  NASA  supports  and  is  implementing  a  defini-
tion  of  rigorous  evaluation  that  includes  RCT-based  methodologies,  as  feasible.
Where RCTs are not feasible, NASA plans to implement alternate evaluation meth-
odologies, commonly called ‘‘Mixed Methods’’ approaches, to capture a complete pic-
ture of education investments to determine effectiveness in achieving outcomes, im-
pact  and  comprehensiveness.  These  Mixed  Methods  are  based  on  the  accepted  pro-
fessional standards for educational evaluations articulated in The Program Evalua-
tion  Standards:  How  to  Assess  Evaluations  of  Educational  Programs,  2nd  edition,
(Joint  Committee  on  Educational  Evaluation,  1994).  Like  RCTs,  these  rigorous
methods  will  lead  to  credible,  objective,  reliable,  and  valid  evaluations  of  program
performance  and  effectiveness.  Mixed-methods  evaluations  use  quantitative  data,
such  as  experimental,  quasi-experimental,  and  correlational  studies,  and  also  use
qualitative  methodologies,  such  as  case  studies,  surveys,  and  focus  groups.  NASA
will  use  RCTs  when  practical  and  relevant,  however  the  Agency  will  typically  use
mixed-methods evaluations.

NASA  has  developed  and  submitted  to  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  a

plan for evaluating each of the Agency’s major projects.

Federal STEM Education Programs
Q1. The Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC) has recommended that no funding
should be increased for a STEM education program ‘‘unless a plan for rigorous,
independent evaluation is in place’’ which is defined in the report as being Ran-
domized Controlled Trials or, when that is not feasible, Well-Matched Compari-

stated  that  this  approach  would  not  be  practical  for  the  majority  of  programs
in  the  federal  R&D  mission  agencies.  I  would  like  to  ask  our  witnesses  to  re-
spond  to  Dr.  Weiss’  opinion.  Is  this  a  practical  way  of  evaluating  programs  at
NASA, Energy, and NIH? What other types of evaluation methods might be bet-
ter suited?

A1. The  Office  of  Science’s  Workforce  Development  for  Teachers  and  Scientists
(WDTS)  program  fully  supports  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council  (ACC)  rec-
ommendations and has developed a rigorous evaluation program currently under re-
view by the Office of Management and Budget. That review program, which is being
designed to ensure that the cost is commensurate with the overall size of the WDTS
program,  emphasizes  three  evaluation  protocols  that  are  consistent  with  the  com-
ments  made  by  Dr.  Weiss.  Those  three  protocols,  which  we  believe  are  appropriate
to the needs of mission agencies such as NASA, the Department of Energy and NIH,
are:

• Quasi-experimental  approaches  that  utilize  well-matched  groups  to  under-
stand  improvements  to  the  learning  of  scientific  content,  STEM  career
choices, and improvements to STEM teaching approaches;
• Long-range  longitudinal  studies  of  student  participants  designed  to  verify
whether WDTS programs are achieving their goal of contributing to the DOE
STEM workforce; and,
• Management effectiveness studies, such as external reviews by Committees of

Visitors, to validate that WDTS programs are managed efficiently.

This  evaluation  program  is  designed  for  the  mission  needs  of  the  Department  of
Energy, which requires development of a highly qualified pool of scientific and tech-
nical  workers  in  the  mission  areas  it  supports  (defense,  environment,  energy,  and
scientific discovery).

Federal STEM Education Programs
Q1. The Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC) has recommended that no funding
should be increased for a STEM education program ‘‘unless a plan for rigorous,
independent evaluation is in place’’ which is defined in the report as being Ran-
domized Controlled Trials or, when that is not feasible, Well-Matched Compari-

spond  to  Dr.  Weiss’  opinion.  Is  this  a  practical  way  of  evaluation  programs  at
NASA, Energy, and NIH? What other types of evaluation methods might be bet-
ter suited?

A1. It  is  important  to  articulate  the  final  goal  of  federal  STEM  education  efforts.
We  should  seek  to  fund  programs  that  really  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  our
children. We want those students with talent and inclination to consider STEM ca-
reers  in  order  to  help  the  government,  and  the  Nation,  meet  its  need  for  technical
professionals.  But  additionally,  in  an  increasingly  competitive  world,  we  want  all
students  to  obtain  the  knowledge  and  skills  (for  example,  problem  solving  and  crit-
ical  thinking)  that  they  will  need  to  find  good  jobs  and  lead  fulfilling  lives.  The
kinds  of  skills  that  students  can  learn  in  STEM  courses  will  help  prepare  them  for
the  21st  century—even  if  they  never  put  on  a  white  coat  or  work  in  a  laboratory.
The  ACC  report  does  not  really  define  rigorous  research  as  ‘‘Randomized  Con-
trolled  Trials,  or  when  that  is  not  feasible,  Well-Matched  Comparison  Group  Stud-
ies.’’  The  report  does  emphasize  the  importance  of  these  evaluation  methods  for
‘‘those  study  designs  whose  purpose  is  to  estimate  a  project’s  impact  on  education
outcomes,  such  as  student  math  and  science  achievement.’’  But  the  report  also  ac-
knowledges  that  much  of  the  federal  STEM  effort  does  not  fall  into  this  category.
The report recognizes that ‘‘no single study design or evaluation methodology is ap-
propriate for all education studies, and that the appropriate methodology should be
selected based on the maturity of the activity, the intended use of the data, and the
inferences to be drawn from study results. . ..’’

Early  in  any  STEM  education  research  endeavor,  most  studies  will  not  be  can-
didates for a randomized controlled trial design. These studies will more likely focus
on  classroom  observations,  developing  early-stage  instructional  materials  or  ap-
proaches,  and  generating  testable  hypotheses  with  regard  to  student  performance.
The ACC recognizes that these types of studies ‘‘are a key part of the research agen-
da  needed  to  improve  U.S.  STEM  education,  can  be  ‘rigorous’  in  their  own  context,
and can serve as valuable precursors and-or complements to impact studies.’’

However,  the  goal  should  ultimately  be  to  determine  what  works  for  students.
Promising  programs  at  different  stages  of  maturity  should  be  identified  and  sub-
jected to evaluation methods that have increasing power to discern whether the stu-
dent  outcomes  observed  are  really  related  to  the  program  interventions.  This  goal
will  push  study  designs  up  the  ‘‘hierarchy  pyramid’’  toward  randomized  controlled
trials.  However,  even  in  these  cases,  a  variety  of  evaluation  methods  will  be  used
to  ‘‘complement’’  the  impact  study.  This  is  because  we  will  seldom  be  satisfied  to
know  simply  whether  a  particular  educational  intervention  works  or  not—we  want
to know why it succeeds, or fails, to achieve the intended objective.

We do know more about how to effectively teach STEM subjects to students than
we did a generation ago. However, the number of such insights that have been rig-
orously  tested  and  that  are  known  to  be  valid  for  large  numbers  of  students  under
a variety of conditions is much smaller than we would like it to be. Carefully apply-
ing the recommendations of the ACC report will help ensure that we are not in the
same situation a generation from now.

STATEMENT OF THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION

NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

Question  1:  What  steps  have  agencies  taken  to  improve  coordination  with  other  fed-
eral  agencies’  STEM  education  activities?  To  what  extent  do  agencies  collaborate
with educators in the states and school districts in developing STEM education pro-
grams?

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is leveraging sev-
eral relationships established through the Academic Competitiveness Council (ACC)
to  foster  improved  coordination  among  Federal  Science,  Technology,  Engineering
and  Mathematics  (STEM)  education  activities.  For  example,  such  relationships  in-
clude:  (1)  the  synthesis  of  independent  evaluations  of  federal  STEM  activities  (as
previously demonstrated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration); (2)
providing  advice  to  other  agencies  (e.g.,  the  National  Science  Foundation)  on  how
to  develop  and  implement  evaluations  programs  consistent  with  the  ACC  rec-
ommendations and metrics; and (3) seeking external advice and guidance to inform
the  design  of  NOAA  STEM  education  activities  (e.g.,  from  the  Department  of  Edu-
cation on NOAA’s Teacher at Sea Program). NOAA looks forward to exploring addi-
tional  opportunities  through  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)
to build on the collaborative activities initiated under the ACC.

NOAA  is  working  with  educators  to  develop  and  improve  individual  STEM  edu-
cation  programs  in  many  states  and  school  districts.  These  programs  are  designed
to  support  the  long-term  development  of  quality  educational  programs  for  all  edu-
cators and students while, simultaneously, meeting the goals of NOAA and the Na-
tion.  For  example  NOAA  is  working  with  California  on  the  state’s  Environmental
Education  Initiative,  and  NOAA  is  working  with  Hawaii  to  develop  a  Marine
Science Curriculum.
Question 2: The recent report of the Academic Competitiveness Council reinforces the
need for better evaluation and performance metrics for federal STEM education pro-
grams.  What  plans  do  agencies  have  for  improvements  in  evaluation  of  STEM  pro-
grams?

NOAA  is  taking  direct  action  to  improve  the  consistency,  rigor,  and  frequency  of
evaluation  activities  for  each  of  its  education  programs.  Specifically,  NOAA  will
measure  the  effectiveness  of  all  its  current  and  future  education  activities  using
methodologies  appropriate  to  the  types  of  activities  funded.  NOAA  has  recently
adopted a program logic model to inform the design and evaluation of all education
activities in the agency, address the performance metrics of the Academic Competi-
tiveness  Council,  and  promote  consistency,  coordination,  and  information  sharing
with other federal entities.

NOAA’s  Educational  Partnership  Program  (EPP)  has  adjusted  its  operation  and
implementation  activities  based  on  annual  client  evaluation;  monitored  the  output
and  products  of  its  programs  against  established  performance  measures;  and  as-
sessed  program  statistics  of  students  who  have  trained  and/or  graduated  in  STEM
fields.  In  addition,  NOAA’s  Cooperative  Science  Centers,  which  are  associated  with
EPP,  were  rigorously  evaluated  after  three  years  of  operation  using  metrics  that
were  established  previously  to  evaluate  NOAA’s  Cooperative  Institutes.  Evaluation
metrics  were  tailored  to  address  a  variety  of  components  such  as  education,  out-
reach, research, administration, recruitment, budgeting, and capacity building being
conducted at each of the Cooperative Science Centers. The accomplishments of each
program  were  compared  to  the  objectives  and  performance  measures  established
during the development phase.

A plan to conduct rigorous, independent evaluation is currently being established
for  NOAA’s  student  scholarship  programs,  which  include  undergraduate  and  grad-
uate fellowships, as well as the Ernest F. Hollings and Dr. Nancy Foster scholarship
programs. Although these programs have not yet been formally evaluated, it should
be  noted  that  there  are  established  performance  measures  in  place  for  each  pro-
gram.
Question  3:  The  Subcommittee  received  testimony  at  a  hearing  on  15  May  on  how
the  R&D  mission  agencies  could  improve  the  effectiveness  of  their  STEM  education
programs.  The  witnesses  were  skeptical  of  the  ability  of  the  agencies  to  develop  cur-
ricular materials for formal classroom instruction and questioned the effectiveness of
their  teacher  professional  development  programs  to  improve  teacher  classroom  per-
formance,  while  suggesting  that  the  agencies’  most  important  role  is  in  informal
STEM  education.  The  witnesses  also  strongly  recommended  closer  collaboration  by

the agencies with educators in the field when developing STEM programs. What are
agencies’ responses to the recommendations from these witnesses?

241

NOAA’s  efforts  do  not  replace  or  supplant  the  critical  role  of  the  State  and  local
governments  in  education.  Because  there  are  limited  resources  to  invest  and  large
needs to support in science education, NOAA believes investments in formal and in-
formal  education  are  most  effective  and  efficient  at  producing  outcomes  when  they
supplement  or  complement  efforts  supported  by  others.  NOAA’s  efforts  are  aimed
at  providing  supplemental  materials  in  subject  areas  where  NOAA  has  unique  ex-
pertise  and  where  sufficient  public  knowledge  is  required  to  ensure  understanding
and  response  to  warnings,  forecasts,  and  stewardship  efforts.  NOAA  education
maximizes use of place-based learning opportunities afforded by field offices, includ-
ing National Marine Sanctuaries, Sea Grant Colleges, National Estuarine Research
Reserves  and  Weather  Forecast  Offices.  We  often  work  through  external  partners,
such as education associations or aquaria and science museums, to enhance our con-
nections to the public and the education community. Students and educators are one
of many groups of users of NOAA data and information. The NOAA Outreach Unit
in Silver Spring, MD receives over 4,000 unique requests each year for NOAA’s edu-
cation materials from teachers, students and librarians.

NOAA  recognizes  that  education  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of  state  and  local
governments.  However,  state  and  local  education  programs  may  not  specifically
focus  on  topics  relevant  to  NOAA’s  mission.  For  example,  the  ocean  sciences  are
under-represented  in  the  national  science  education  standards  for  grades  K–12.  In
addition, teacher content knowledge is not always sufficient in the ocean and atmos-
pheric  sciences.  As  a  result,  students  graduating  from  U.S.  high  schools  may  not
possess sufficient understanding of the earth processes and phenomena that are the
focus of NOAA research, monitoring, and prediction efforts.

NOAA’s  informal  education  activities  provide  educational  experiences  that  typi-
cally  involve  taking  students  to  unique  settings  outside  of  the  classroom.  Informal
education  combines  well-established  educational  methods  with  the  excitement  of
hands-on activities and field experiences and develops life long interest in the ocean
and  atmosphere.  NOAA’s  informal  education  activities  include  hosting  school  chil-
dren,  community  groups,  and  the  general  public  at  NOAA  sites,  supporting  hands-
on  experiences  in  NOAA-related  sciences  and  increasing  the  inclusion  of  NOAA-re-
lated topics at science centers, museums, and aquaria.
Question  4:  How  do  agencies  determine  priorities  for  K–16  STEM  education  port-
folio?  Has  agencies’  balance  of  programs  at  graduate/post  doctoral,  undergraduate,
K–12, and informal education changed much over the past few years? Is there a like-
lihood of a change in that balance in the future?

Most of the investment priorities and the general direction of NOAA education ac-
tivities  over  the  past  few  years  has  been  determined  by  Congress—either  through
legislation  (e.g.,  the  National  Marine  Sanctuaries  Act,  Coastal  Zone  Management
Act,  Sea  Grant  Act)  or  through  appropriations  language  (Environmental  Literacy
Grants).  Other  education  activities  are  supported  by  across  the  board  percentages
which Congress has instigated (e.g., NOAA-wide in the case of the Hollings Scholar-
ship  Program  and  Sanctuaries-wide  in  the  case  of  the  Nancy  Foster  Scholarship
Program). Within these external constraints, NOAA’s process for determining prior-
ities  is  based  on  national  peer  reviewed  competitions  focused  on  advancing  earth
system  science  education.  Although  there  is  no  formal  review  process  to  determine
priorities for funding, the following criteria are used informally:

Proposed projects should:

• deliver NOAA-wide benefit;
• have hard schedule drivers that require action within a one to two year time

frame;

• reach a large, high priority audience;
• result in a significant impact on the audience reached;
• increase understanding of NOAA science and service;
• leverage partnerships;
• build on existing NOAA investments; and
• target NOAA priority areas.

Question  5:  How  do  agencies  disseminate  information  about  STEM  education  pro-
grams?  What  organizations,  both  government  and  private,  have  agencies  partnered
with to reach educators in the field?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 12:02 Nov 12, 2007 Jkt 035233 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\R&SE07\051507\35233A SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

242

NOAA relies on partnerships with a variety of government, non-government, non-
profit,  and  private  organizations  to  disseminate  information  about  our  STEM  edu-
cation  programs.  Partnerships  mentioned  above  with  State  departments  of  edu-
cation  allow  NOAA  to  directly  assist  state  efforts  to  improve  STEM-related  edu-
cation  in  areas  specific  to  NOAA  science  (e.g.,  watershed  and  environmental  edu-
cation  in  the  states  that  are  party  to  the  Chesapeake  Bay  agreement  and  its  edu-
cation  commitments;  environmental  education  in  California;  marine  science  edu-
cation in Hawaii).

NOAA  also  depends  heavily  on  the  dissemination  networks  of  State  and  univer-
sity partners for the education programs funded by the National Sea Grant College
Program,  the  National  Estuarine  Research  Reserve  System,  and  cooperative  re-
search programs including the Educational Partnership Program, Joint Research In-
stitutes, and Cooperative Institutes.

Other  federal  partners,  such  as  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administra-
tion  and  the  National  Science  Foundation,  leverage  NOAA  investments  for  broader
impact  including  improving  the  rigor  and  credibility  of  high  school  Earth  systems
science course work and build centers for Coastal Ocean Science Educational Excel-
lence.  In  the  past  few  years,  multiple  partners  joined  NOAA  to  develop  Ocean  Lit-
eracy  Principles  to  assist  teachers  in  using  ocean  concepts  and  examples  to  teach
state science standards, and similar efforts are underway for climate literacy. NOAA
also partners with the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the
National  Academy  of  Sciences  to  maintain  the  currency  of  the  science  education
standards and benchmarks disseminated by these organizations.

To  reach  classroom  teachers  directly,  NOAA  partners  with  organizations  with
large  teacher  membership  and  distribution  networks  and  teacher  training  efforts
(e.g., National Science Teacher Association, National Marine Educators Association,
American  Meteorological  Society,  the  Jason  Project).  NOAA  also  supports  online,
searchable  education  resource  libraries  that  provide  access  to  standards-referenced,
peer-reviewed  education  materials  and  lesson  plans  for  teachers  (e.g.,  Digital  Li-
brary 
the  Bridge,  http://
www2.vims.edu/bridge/noaa/).

for  Earth  Systems  Science,  www.dlese.org; 

Partnerships  are  essential  to  NOAA’s  informal  education  efforts  to  promote
STEM-related  education  related  to  NOAA  science  in  the  general  public  as  well  as
supplementing  the  activities  of  the  formal  education  system.  NOAA’s  partnerships
with individual as well as networks of science centers, museums, aquaria, and zoos
produce  innovative  exhibits  and  displays  and  complementary  educational  program-
ming. These partnerships include world renowned institutions such as the American
Museum  of  Natural  History  and  the  Smithsonian  Institution  National  Museum  of
Natural  History,  and  organizations  such  as  American  Zoo  and  Aquarium  Associa-
tion,  Association  of  Science-Technical  Centers,  and  Coastal  Ecosystem  Learning
Centers).  Partnerships  with  non-profit,  private,  and  government  organizations  also
enable  NOAA’s  efforts  to  improve  public  understanding  related  to  STEM  through
radio and television programming and public media campaigns.
