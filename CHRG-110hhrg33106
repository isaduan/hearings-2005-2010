HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

The Administration’s Fiscal Year 2008

Research and Development

Budget Proposal

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2007

10:00 A.M.–12:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

1. Purpose

On Wednesday, February 14, 2007, the Committee on Science and Technology will
hold a hearing to consider the Administration’s proposal for federal research and de-
velopment  funding  for  Fiscal  Year  2008  (FY  2008).  The  Committee  will  hold  an-
other,  separate  hearing  to  examine  the  President’s  proposed  budget  for  NASA
(therefore,  only  brief  analysis  is  provided  for  the  NASA  budget  proposal).  Sub-
committees  also  will  hold  additional  hearings  regarding  proposed  agency  budgets.
2. Witness
Dr.  John  H.  Marburger,  III  is  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology
Policy (OSTP). The mission of the office is to serve as a source of scientific and tech-
nological  analysis  and  judgment  for  the  President  with  respect  to  major  policies,
plans,  and  programs  of  the  Federal  Government.  Dr.  Marburger  also  co-chairs  the
President’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) and supports
the President’s National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).
3. Overview

The  President  released  his  proposed  FY  2008  budget  on  February  5.  The  budget
proposes $143 billion in federal research and development (R&D) funding, a 1.4 per-
cent increase over the anticipated FY 2007 level.1 The budget proposes increases for
research programs within the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), as well as
human space exploration, but proposes decreases in much of the remaining non-de-
fense federal research and development portfolio.

The FY 2008 budget would provide $11.4 billion for research within programs that
are part of the ACI—the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy Office
of  Science,  and  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  lab  research  and
construction accounts.

However, outside of the ACI programs, research and development for many agen-
cies  and  programs  would  be  cut  compared  to  the  FY  2007  level.  For  example,  the
following reductions are proposed in the FY 2008 budget:

• DOE  Energy  R&D  (excluding  Office  of  Science)—$133  million  or  9.2  percent
• National Institutes of Health—$325 million or 1.1 percent
• Department of Agriculture R&D—$245 million or 10.9 percent
• Department of Homeland Security—$15 million or 1.6 percent
• Environmental Protection Agency—$20 million or 3.5 percent
• NOAA—$57 million or 9.5 percent

If research alone is considered separate from development activities, the President
also  is  proposing  significant  cuts  to  many  programs.  Overall,  federal  basic  and  ap-
plied research would be cut by two percent compared to FY 2007, and in real terms,
federal research would decrease for the 4th year in a row. For example, the FY 2008
budget proposes the following reductions in basic and applied research:

• NASA—$16 million, or 1.1 percent
• National Institutes of Health—$356 million, or 1.3 percent

1 Unless otherwise noted, FY 2007 figures are based on the House-passed version of H.J. Res.

• Department of Agriculture—$206 million or 10.5 percent
• NOAA—$42 million, or 8.3 percent
• Environmental Protection Agency—$20 million, or 4.3 percent

In  addition,  according  to  an  analysis  by  the  American  Association  for  the  Ad-
vancement  of  Science  (AAAS),  federal  research  investments  also  are  declining  as  a
share  of  GDP,  while  other  nations’  investments  are  rising.  Federal  research  invest-
ments  have  failed  to  match  other  nations,  especially  in  Asia,  government  research
is  climbing  dramatically.  China  and  South  Korea,  for  example,  have  committed  to
increase government research investments by 10 percent annually.

Below is more detailed analysis of how several agencies and programs within the
jurisdiction  of  the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  fared  in  the  President’s
budget proposal.
4. Selected Agency Analysis
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)2

The FY 2008 budget request for NASA is $17.3 billion, $1.1 billion above the level
in H.J. Res. 20. However, this increase would mostly fund human space exploration
programs,  specifically  the  International  Space  Station,  Crew  Launch  Vehicle,  and
Crew Exploration Vehicle.

In  the  Science  account,  proposed  funding  for  FY  2008  (and  through  FY  2011)
would  be  constrained  to  grow  at  one  percent  per  year.  The  impact  on  specific  pro-
gram  areas  would  vary—for  example,  funding  for  Astrophysics  (including  the
Hubble  telescope)  would  decline  from  $1.6  billion  to  $1.3  billion  over  the  FY  2008–
11  period,  while  Earth  Science  funding  would  grow  slightly  between  FY  2008  and
FY  2009  and  then  decline  for  the  rest  of  the  decade  to  a  level  of  $1.4  billion  in  FY
2012.  Planetary  Science  would  grow  from  $1.4  billion  in  FY  2008  to  $1.7  billion  in
FY 2012.

Aeronautics  funding  would  decrease  by  $336.4  million  from  the  level  of  $890.4
million in FY 2007. And, education funding would decline from the FY 2007 request
level of $167.4 million to $149.6 million by FY 2012.

Funding for the Exploration initiative would increase from $3.9 billion in FY 2008
to  $9.1  billion  in  FY  2012.  Funding  on  Space  Operations  (Shuttle,  International
Space  Station,  Space  Communications,  and  Launch  Services)  would  decline  from  a
level of $6.8 billion in FY 2008 to a level of $3.0 billion in FY 2012.
Department of Energy

The FY 2008 Administration request for the entire Department of Energy is $24.3
billion.  Of  that,  approximately  $7.5  billion  is  dedicated  to  non-defense  activities  in
Science,  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy,  Nuclear  Energy,  Fossil  Energy,
and  Electricity.  The  remaining  $16.75  billion  is  divided  between  the  nuclear  weap-
ons  mission,  environmental  cleanup  and  radioactive  waste.  Appearing  for  the  first
time  in  the  President’s  budget  is  the  Innovative  Technology  Loan  Guarantee  Pro-
gram  created  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005.  This  program  would  provide  loan
guarantees for advanced technology projects that avoid, reduce, or sequester air pol-
lutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and have a reasonable pros-
pect of repaying the principal and interest on their debt obligations.

Office of Science

As part of the President’s American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), the FY 2008
budget  request  for  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  is  $4.4  billion.  This  represents  an  in-
crease of $602 million, or 15.9 percent over the FY 2007 level.

The  FY  2008  request  for  Basic  Energy  Sciences  (BES)  is  $1.5  billion,  an  increase
of  $301  million  or  25  percent  more  than  the  FY  2007  level.  As  the  largest  program
within the Office of Science, BES conducts research primarily in the areas of mate-
rials sciences and engineering.

The budget would provide $340 million for the Advanced Scientific and Computing
Research (ASCR), an increase of $106 million or 45 percent over the FY 2007 level.
This includes funding to continue upgrading the Leadership Class Facility (LCF) at
Oak  Ridge  National  Lab,  making  it  the  world’s  largest  civilian  high  performance
computing system.

Biological  and  Environmental  Research  (BER)  would  receive  $532  million,  an  in-
crease  of  $70  million  or  15  percent  over  the  FY  2007  level.  In  addition  to  the  role
of BER in areas such as genomics and climate change research, the FY 2008 request

2 Additional  information  on  specific  budget  increases  and  decreases,  as  well  as  policy  issues
raised by the FY 2008 budget request, will be provided in the hearing charter for the upcoming
hearing on NASA’s FY 2008 budget request.

supports  the  startup  of  three  bioenergy  research  centers  to  investigate  biological
processes  for  developing  and  deploying  large  scale,  environmentally  sound  biotech-
nologies to produce ethanol from cellulosic biomass (plant materials).

The  FY  2008  funding  request  for  High  Energy  Physics  (HEP)  is  $782.2  million,
which  is  $50  million  or  seven  percent  more  than  the  FY  2007  level.  This  program
funds  fundamental  research  in  elementary  particle  physics  and  accelerator  science
and technology.

Fusion  Energy  Sciences  (FES)  receives  $428  million,  a  substantial  increase  ($143
million  or  40  percent)  over  the  FY  2007  level.  Of  this  amount,  $160  million  would
be  dedicated  to  support  the  U.S.  role  in  the  International  Thermonuclear  Experi-
mental  Reactor  (ITER).  Finally,  Nuclear  Physics  (NP)  would  receive  $471  million,
an increase of $75 million (19 percent) over FY 2007.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)

The  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy  (EERE)  would  increase
slightly  by  $42.6  million  (four  percent)  compared  to  FY  2007.  However,  the  budget
includes large cuts for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (down 74 percent
compared  to  FY  2007);  Weatherization  and  State  Energy  Programs  (down  37  per-
cent);  Industrial  Technologies  Program  (down  20  percent);  and  the  Federal  Energy
Management Program (down 14 percent), as well as the elimination of some renew-
able energy R&D programs.

Biomass and Biorefinery Systems would receive $179 million (almost double com-
pared  to  the  FY  2007  level).  This  very  large  increase  is  intended  to  address  the
President’s  goal  of  making  cellulosic  ethanol  cost-competitive  by  2012  and  also  en-
able  a  supply  of  35  billion  gallons  of  alternative  fuels  annually  in  accordance  with
the Twenty in Ten program—a reduction of US gasoline usage by 20 percent in the
next ten years—as outlined in the 2007 State of the Union Address.

Solar  energy  would  receive  $148  million,  $64.6  million  or  75  percent  more  than
in FY 2007. This level supports the President’s Solar America Initiative (SAI), which
seeks to make electricity from photovoltaic cells cost competitive by 2015. Wind en-
ergy would be slated for $40 million, approximately level with FY 2007 funding. As
in the 2007 budget request, the Administration would eliminate R&D in Geothermal
power, despite a comprehensive study released in January by the Massachusetts In-
stitute  of  Technology  that  found  that  the  large  amounts  of  heat  in  stored  in  the
Earth’s  crust  could  supply  a  substantial  portion  of  the  United  States’  future  elec-
tricity  requirements  with  minimal  environmental  impact  and  probably  at  competi-
tive prices. Hydropower R&D would also be eliminated.

The  FY  2008  request  for  Vehicle  Technologies  R&D,  which  includes  funding  to
spur  the  development  of  technologies  for  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles,  would  be  reduced
by $6.4 million or four percent. Building Technologies would rise by 25 percent com-
pared  to  the  FY  2007  level  to  $86.4  million.  However,  the  Industrial  Technologies
program, which aims to reduce the energy intensity of the U.S. economy by improv-
ing the energy efficiency of the Nation’s industrial sector, would decrease by 20 per-
cent ($11 million).

Office of Nuclear Energy

Nuclear  Energy  (NE)  receives  $568  million  for  research  and  development,  with  a
large  portion  of  that  dedicated  to  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership  (GNEP).
For  the  Nuclear  office,  this  represents  an  increase  of  $220  million,  or  64  percent
over  the  FY  2007  request,  and  $347  million  (157  percent)  above  the  FY  2006  Con-
gressionally appropriated amount.

The  Administration  unveiled  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership  (GNEP)  in
2006  as  a  plan  to  develop  advanced,  proliferation-resistant  nuclear  fuel  cycle  tech-
nologies that would maximize the energy extracted from nuclear fuels and minimize
nuclear  waste.  GNEP  has  been  very  controversial  in  Congress,  with  little  support
in the House where only token funding has been approved. For instance, the Admin-
istration  requested  approximately  $250  million  in  FY  2007  for  GNEP  (through  the
Advanced  Fuel  Cycle  Initiative—AFCI).  If  the  CR  maintains  FY  2006  appropriated
levels,  GNEP  will  only  receive  roughly  $80  million  for  FY  2007.  Nonetheless,  the
President’s FY 2008 request for GNEP is $395 million.

Chief  among  the  concerns  about  GNEP  is  the  cost  of  implementing  the  program
(up to $40 billion) and then deploying a fleet of the required technologies on a com-
mercial  scale  (more  than  $200  billion),  and  whether  such  a  program  warrants  the
costs. There are also issues with premature selection of technologies before the com-
pletion  of  a  full  system-wide  analysis  of  what  would  be  required.  Many  are  con-
cerned  that  DOE  has  not  adequately  demonstrated  an  ability  to  carry  out  large
scale  construction  and  operation  of  such  a  project  without  major  cost  and  schedule
overruns.

Finally, the Nuclear Power 2010 program also would receive a considerable boost
with  an  FY  2008  request  of  $114  million,  which  is  more  than  double  the  amount
provided  in  FY  2007.  The  increase  is  intended  to  go  to  continue  activities  in  new
reactor designs and licensing applications with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
to support an industry decision to build a new power plant by 2009.

Fossil R&D

Fossil Energy R&D would receive $557 million in FY 2008, a two percent increase
compared  to  FY  2007.  Funding  increases  would  go  exclusively  to  coal  R&D,  includ-
ing  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  (which  aims  to  develop  technologies  that  will
increase  efficiency  of  coal-fired  power  plants,  reduce  mercury  and  NOΧ emissions,
and  improve  carbon  capture  and  sequestration)  and  the  FutureGen  project  to  dem-
onstrate near-zero atmospheric emissions electricity production.

The FY 2008 budget once again proposes to eliminate all oil and gas R&D, includ-
ing  $50  million  in  direct  spending  (mandated  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005)  for
unconventional  onshore  and  offshore  natural  gas  exploration  technologies  that
would go largely to smaller independent oil and gas producers.

Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program (LGP)

The FY 2008 budget proposes $8.4 million to fund the Office of Loan Guarantees,
which  will  administer  the  Innovative  Technology  Loan  Guarantee  Program  (LGP).
The program was established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to provide loan guar-
antees  for  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  clean  coal,  advanced  nuclear,  and
other  innovative  energy  projects.  The  FY  2008  budget  request  assumes  a  loan  vol-
ume  of  $9  billion  for  such  projects.  Of  this,  $4  billion  is  set  aside  for  large  electric
power  generation  projects  such  as  advanced  nuclear  and  coal  gasification  with  car-
bon sequestration. An additional $4 billion is set aside to promote biofuels and clean
transportation  fuels,  and  $1  billion  for  new  technologies  in  electricity  transmission
and  renewable  power  systems.  The  House  CR  for  FY  2007  provides  $7  million  for
the administration of the program.
National Science Foundation

The National Science Foundation is the primary source of federal funding for non-
medical  basic  research  conducted  at  colleges  and  universities  and  serves  as  a  cata-
lyst for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education reform
at  all  levels.  NSF  is  one  of  the  research  agencies  that  the  President,  in  his  2006
State of the Union Address, proposed to double over ten years as part of the Amer-
ican Competitive Initiative (ACI).

The FY 2007 budget request, which called for a $439 million (7.9 percent) increase
over  the  FY  2006  budget,  was  the  first  to  reflect  the  ACI.  H.J.  Res.  20,  the  House-
passed CR, would fund NSF at $5.9 billion in FY 2007, a $335 million (6.0 percent)
increase  from  FY  2006,  but  a  $105  million  (1.7  percent)  decrease  from  last  year’s
request. Specifically, H.J. Res. 20 appropriates $4.7 billion for the Research and Re-
lated Activities (R&RA) account, and remains silent on the rest of the NSF accounts,
signaling a continuation of FY 2006 funding levels for those accounts. The FY 2008
request  of  $6.4  billion  is  $513  million  (8.7  percent)  greater  than  what  is  provided
for FY 2007.

Research and Related Activities (R&RA)

The FY 2008 request provides scientific research programs and research facilities
(which comprise the R&RA account) with a $367 million (7.7 percent) increase from
FY  2007.  The  increases  for  scientific  research  are  spread  fairly  evenly  among  all
fields NSF supports. The largest percentage increases are for the math and physical
sciences, computer sciences, and engineering directorates. The (non-medical) biologi-
cal  sciences  and  the  social,  behavioral  and  economic  sciences  directorates  receive
smaller increases.

NSF’s  contribution  to  the  multi-agency  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  in-
creases  by  $17  million  (4.5  percent),  including  $3  million  more  in  support  of  re-
search on the environmental, health and safety (EHS) aspects of nanotechnology. In
particular, support is requested for a new, multi-disciplinary center to conduct EHS
research  and  provide  the  science  needed  to  inform  the  development  of  regulations.

Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC)

The  MREFC  activity  funds  the  construction  of  large  research  facilities,  such  as
telescopes  and  research  ships.  Funding  for  the  operation  and  management  of  these
major user facilities is included in the R&RA budget.

The  FY  2008  request  provides  an  increase  of  $54  million  (28.2  percent)  for
MREFC,  which  will  allow  for  continuation  of  support  for  six  construction  projects
and one new start. The new project, which is funded at $33 million in the first year,

will provide for an upgrade to increase the sensitivity of an Earth-based observatory
for the study of gravitational waves.

Three  new  projects  proposed  under  last  year’s  request  are  currently  on  hold  due
to  funding  uncertainties.  Under  the  FY  2007  funding  levels,  NSF  would  be  able  to
proceed  on  schedule  with  the  two  smaller  projects  (the  National  Ecological  Observ-
atory  Network  and  Ocean  Observatories  Initiative),  but  would  have  only  $6  million
of the $56 million requested for the Alaska Region Research Vessel (ARRV).

Education and Human Resources (EHR)

EHR  includes  most  of  NSF’s  activities  that  support  K–12  STEM  education  and
the majority of activities that support undergraduate STEM education. EHR also in-
cludes most of NSF’s graduate fellowship and traineeship programs.

The  FY  2008  EHR  budget  request  is  $751  million,  a  $34  million  (4.8  percent)  in-
crease  from  the  FY  2007  request  and  a  $53  million  (7.5  percent)  increase  from  the
FY 2007 level. Most of this proposed funding increase goes to increases in graduate
research  fellowships  (+  $11.2  million)  and  in  activities  to  broaden  participation  in
STEM fields (+ $28.6 million). NSF has also launched a concerted effort to evaluate
program  effectiveness  across  EHR,  and  in  particular,  for  its  STEM  education  pro-
grams and projects.

Overall  funding  for  K–12  programs  in  the  FY  2008  request  falls  by  $15  million
(nine  percent)  from  the  FY  2007  level,  and  is  flat  compared  to  the  President’s  FY
2007  request.  In  addition,  after  proposing  no  new  Math  and  Science  Partnership
(MSP)  grants  in  the  past  two  budgets,  the  Administration  would  make  $30  million
available  for  new  grants  in  FY  2008.  However,  the  FY  2008  budget  request  is  $46
million—the same as the FY 2007 budget request and $17 million less than FY 2006
spending.

Agency Operations and Award Management

This NSF account, previously called Salaries and Expenses, funds the internal op-
erations of NSF. The FY 2008 request provides an increase of $39 million (15.7 per-
cent)  above  the  FY  2007  level.  NSF  is  facing  the  challenge  of  expanding  its  work-
force  to  accommodate  the  demands  created  by  the  growing  research  budgets.  H.J.
Res. 20 would delay many planned new-hires in addition to planned upgrades of the
electronic  system  used  to  receive  and  process  grant  applications.  Most  of  the  $39
million increase for agency operations and award management in the FY 2008 budg-
et request are slated for these two needs.
Department of Homeland Security S&T Directorate

The overall budget for the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Tech-
nology  (S&T)  Directorate  is  cut  by  $174  million  or  17.9  percent,  and  most  research
divisions  would  receive  cuts  in  the  FY  2008  request.  This  is  the  second  year  in  a
row in which the Administration has proposed budget cuts for the S&T Directorate.
The  only  significant  budget  increase  is  for  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Innovation,
which  oversees  the  Homeland  Security  Advanced  Research  Project  Agency
(HSARPA),  the  external  research  funding  arm  for  DHS.  HSARPA  funds  high  risk
research  and  rapid  prototyping  in  the  field  of  homeland  security-related  technology
development. This office increases by 58 percent to nearly $60 million.

In  2006,  Under  Secretary  for  S&T  Admiral  Jay  Cohen  realigned  the  S&T  Direc-
torate.  The  FY  2008  budget  reflects  the  new  organization,  and  establishes  new  Of-
fices  for  the  Director  of  Transition  and  Director  of  Innovation.  The  research  sup-
ported by the directorate is divided into three categories: basic research, innovative
capabilities  (applied),  and  product  transition  (development).  The  FY  2008  budget  is
strongly tilted towards biological and chemical countermeasures research, as in pre-
vious  years,  and  this  category  represents  29  percent  of  the  overall  S&T  Directorate
budget. Whether this balance of priorities matches risk is unclear, and DHS is over-
due  to  submit  a  report  that  will  make  certain  that  priorities  are  coordinated  with
a  risk  assessment.  DHS  currently  expects  to  submit  this  report  in  February  2007.
In  addition,  there  remains  an  imbalance  between  long-term  and  short-term  re-
search, with the Department showing a strong focus on product development at the
expense of longer-term basic research (which accounts for only 10 percent of the FY
2008 request). The proposal of the formation of the Office of the Director of Transi-
tion,  which  would  be  responsible  for  working  with  DHS  components  to  speed  tech-
nology transition, suggests that short-term development will become an even greater
priority  for  the  S&T  Directorate.  Additionally,  the  lack  of  stability  in  the  reporting
structure  brought  about  by  the  formation  of  new  offices  could  cause  problems  for
coordinating research and aligning priorities within the Department and the broad-
er federal R&D enterprise.

In particular of note:

• The  Chemical  and  Biological  Division  would  be  cut  by  $84.6  million,  which
would  be  transferred  to  the  Office  of  Health  Affairs  for  the  BioWatch  pro-
gram,  the  Biological  Warning  and  Incident  Characterization  (BWIC)  system,
and  the  Rapidly  Deployable  Chemical  Detection  System.  A  recent  report  by
the Department’s Inspector General criticized the BioWatch program, specifi-
cally for poor management and quality control. This new office is likely a re-
sponse to a call for stricter management protocols, but it is unclear what real
changes will be brought about by its creation.
• Funding for the Explosives Division is reduced by $41.5 million or 40 percent
compared  to  FY  2007.  This  reduction  is  partially  a  result  of  the  completion
of  the  Counter-MANPADS  program.  If  the  Counter-MANPADS  program  is
not considered in the budget calculation, the total funding for explosives coun-
termeasures would decrease by $22.9 million or 26.4 percent.
• Funding  for  the  Infrastructure  and  Geophysical  Division  is  reduced  by  $50.8
million  or  68  percent.  Funding  would  be  eliminated  for  two  research  insti-
tutes (including the Southeast Regional Research Initiative at Oak Ridge Na-
tional Lab and Community Based Critical Infrastructure Protection Institute)
and  significant  cuts  would  be  made  to  the  Regional  Technology  Integration
Initiative.
• Funding for Laboratory Facilities would decrease by $16.8 million or 16.0 per-
cent  from  FY  2007.  The  reduction  includes  a  decrease  for  the  Plum  Island
Animal Disease Center (PIADC) and cuts in construction funding for the Na-
tional  Bio  and  Agro-Defense  Facility  (NBAF).  These  cuts  could  curtail  efforts
to prevent an outbreak of costly diseases in livestock, such as Foot and Mouth
disease.
• Funding for University Programs is reduced by $9.9 million (20 percent) com-
pared  to  FY  2007.  DHS  plans  to  use  the  proposed  funding  to  establish  four
new University Centers of Excellence in spite of the large reduction, thus cut-
ting  funding  for  all  current  centers.  Additional  goals  for  the  program  in  FY
2008  include  improving  the  capabilities  of  Minority  Serving  Institutions—
which  are  currently  under-represented—to  conduct  research  in  homeland  se-
curity  related  areas  and  incorporating  Minority  Serving  Institutions  into  the
University  Centers  program.  Examples  of  affected  university  programs  in-
clude the National Center for Food Protection and Defense, of which the Uni-
versity of Arkansas is a participant.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

The FY 2008 budget request for NIST is $25.2 million (or four percent) less than
the FY 2007 level. As part of the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI), the Ad-
ministration proposes increasing the NIST labs account by $76.3 million (an 18 per-
cent increase) and the construction account by $35.3 million (a 60 percent increase)
However, these proposed increases are more than offset by the Administration’s pro-
posal  to  eliminate  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)  and  cutting  the  Manu-
facturing  Extension  Program  (MEP)  by  $58.3  million  (a  56  percent  cut).  Therefore,
despite  proposed  increased  for  physical  sciences  research  at  NIST,  once  again,  no
new funds are proposed for the agency.

The FY 2007 House-passed CR would fully fund MEP and would provide $79 mil-
lion  for  ATP.  With  carry-over  funds  from  the  prior  year,  the  ATP  will  be  able  to
make  at  least  $40  million  in  new  awards  in  FY  2007.  However,  the  CR  does  not
specifically state that ATP must make new awards, and in past years, the Adminis-
tration has tried to block new awards even though the funds were appropriated.

NIST Labs

The NIST laboratories conduct research supporting U.S. technology infrastructure
by  developing  tools  to  measure,  evaluate  and  standardize,  enabling  U.S.  companies
to  innovate  and  remain  competitive.  NIST  helps  U.S.  companies,  workers,  and  con-
sumers  by  ensuring  that  standards  are  used  to  create  a  level  playing  field—not  a
barrier  to  trade—in  the  global  marketplace.  Under  the  FY  2008  budget  request,
funding  for  the  NIST  labs  would  increase  by  $75.7  million  or  18  percent,  as  part
of the ACI.

Advanced Technology Program (ATP)

The ATP was created to foster economic growth through the development of inno-
vative  technologies.  Through  private/public  partnerships,  ATP’s  early  stage  invest-
ment is accelerating the development of high-risk, broadly enabling technologies and
helping bridge the gap between the laboratory and the market place. Through May
2004,  ATP  co-funded  736  projects  with  1,468  participants.  Sixty-six  percent  of  ATP

9

projects  are  led  by  small  businesses,  while  more  than  160  colleges  and  universities
have  participated  in  ATP  projects.  Benefit-cost  studies  from  approximately  40
projects indicate an eight to one return on investment.

The FY 2008 budget proposes to eliminate ATP funding. The Administration justi-
fies the termination of the ATP based on the growth of venture cap funds and other
financial services for high-risk technologies, but has not provided documentation for
these assertions.

Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP)

MEP is a proven public/private partnership in all 50 states and Puerto Rico with
the  mission  of  improving  the  competitiveness  of  small  and  medium-sized  manufac-
turers. In FY 2005, MEP, a network of 59 centers, assisted more than 16,000 small
manufacturers,  providing  a  ten  to  one  return  on  federal  investment.  In  a  survey  of
approximately 25 percent of MEP clients, they reported over $1.3 billion in cost sav-
ings  directly  attributed  to  the  program’s  assistance  as  well  as  creating  $6.3  billion
in  new  or  retained  sales.  The  program  also  helped  create/retain  more  than  53,000
jobs and increased investment by $2.3 billion returned to the economy.

In  the  FY  2008  budget,  the  Administration  proposes  cutting  MEP  funding  by  56
percent  to  $46.3  million.  The  request  includes  $11.3  million  for  overhead  and  over-
sight,  leaving  only  $35  million  for  actual  grants  to  MEP  centers—less  than  half  of
what is required to maintain a fully operation national network of MEP centers. (In
FY  2006,  $92  million  in  grants  were  made  to  MEP  Centers.)  The  Administration
justifies the MEP cut by claiming that the program has evolved to where less fund-
ing  is  required,  and  that  MEP  services  also  are  provided  by  private  entities.  How-
ever,  a  report  by  the  National  Association  of  Public  Administrators  concluded  that
the  small  manufacturing  community  is  under-served  and  that  MEP  does  not  dis-
place the private sector.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

The  President’s  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos-
pheric Administration (NOAA) is $3.96 billion, 2.7 percent below the FY 2006 appro-
priated  funding  (which  is  generally  expected  to  continue  with  no  increases  in  FY
2007).

NOAA’s mission includes weather forecasting and climate prediction, and manage-
ment of fisheries, coastal and ocean resources. In addition, NOAA is responsible for
mapping and charting coastal areas and providing other navigation support services
through  programs  of  the  National  Ocean  Service.  NOAA  also  conducts  research  in
support  of  these  missions  including  atmospheric  sciences,  coastal  and  oceanic
science, climate and air quality research, ecosystem research, and fisheries and ma-
rine mammal research. Finally, NOAA also operates a constellation of satellites that
monitor and transmit data for weather forecasting, climate prediction, space weath-
er forecasting, and Earth and ocean science research.

National Weather Service

The National Weather Service (NWS) is the only office that receives a substantial
increase  in  the  President’s  FY  2008  request.  The  FY  2008  request  for  NWS  is  6.5
percent ($55.3 million) higher than the FY 2006 enacted levels.

National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS)

The President’s FY 2008 budget request would increase the overall NESDIS budg-
et  by  three  percent  ($26  million).  The  budget  for  NESDIS  is  dominated  by  the  pro-
curement,  acquisitions  and  construction  (PAC)  accounts  for  the  polar  and  geo-
stationary satellite systems.

The  Operations,  Research  and  Facilities  (ORF)  account  for  NESDIS  contains  the
programmatic  funding  for  management,  processing,  analyzing,  and  archiving  the
data received from all of NOAA’s weather monitoring equipment—ground-based and
space-based.  This  program  provides  funding  for  data  processing  and  analyses  at
data  centers  located  in  Kentucky,  North  Carolina,  Maryland,  and  West  Virginia.
This  account  also  supports  a  number  of  regional  climate  centers.  The  FY  2008  re-
quest  for  these  accounts  is  $20  million  below  the  FY  2006  enacted  levels.  The  FY
2008  request  also  eliminates  $4  million  in  funding  for  NOAA–NASA  Partnerships
to  facilitate  the  transfer  of  research  to  operations.  The  Data  Centers  and  Informa-
tion Services accounts are reduced by $18 million from the FY 2006 enacted levels.
NOAA  operates  two  satellite  systems  that  collect  data  for  weather  forecasting.
The  polar  satellites  (Polar-Orbiting  Environmental  Satellites—POES)  orbit  the
Earth and provide information for medium to long-range weather forecasts. The geo-
stationary  satellites  (GOES)  gather  data  above  a  fixed  position  on  the  Earth’s  sur-
face  and  provide  information  for  short-range  warnings  and  current  weather  condi-
tions.  Both  of  these  systems  are  scheduled  for  replacement  through  the  NPOESS

and  GOES–R  programs,  respectively.  Because  of  the  long  time  period  required  to
design  and  develop  new  satellite  series,  the  procurement  of  a  new  series  begins
years  before  the  current  series  has  completed  its  production  cycle.  Therefore,
NOAA’s  procurement  budget  in  this  area  includes  both  funds  to  complete  and
launch  current  weather  satellites  (POES  and  GOES)  and  funds  to  design  and  de-
velop the next generation of weather satellites (NPOESS and GOES–R).

The current series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES–
N, O and P) are nearing completion. GOES–N was launched last May. The FY 2008
request  of  $80.4  million  will  support  the  continued  development,  procurement  and
launch of the remaining GOES satellites scheduled for April 2007 and October 2008,
respectively.  The  request  for  GOES–R,  the  new  series  of  geostationary  satellites
($279  million)  has  been  reduced  from  the  original  FY  2008  estimate  ($532  million)
to reflect changes in the program’s content (reducing the number of instruments and
planned number of satellites) and to provide additional time to re-structure the pro-
gram.

The  current  series  of  Polar-Orbiting  Environmental  Satellites  (POES)  is  nearing
the end of its production cycle. The FY 2008 request to complete the current POES
series is $115 million.

The FY 2008 request for NPOESS, the new polar satellite series, is $331 million.
This  is  $13  million  less  than  planned  for  in  last  year’s  request.  The  funding  will
cover  the  continued  development,  production  and  risk  reduction  activities  for  the
four  key  instruments  to  be  included  on  the  test  satellite,  the  NPOESS  Preparatory
Project  (NPP),  scheduled  for  launch  in  2010.  The  out-year  funding  profile  for  this
program  will  be  re-done  and  the  prime  contract  for  managing  this  program  (with
Northrup-Grumman) will be re-negotiated later this year.

Oceanic and Atmospheric Research

The office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research contains over half of the research
programs  at  NOAA.  These  programs  are  reduced  by  nearly  $11  million  below  the
FY  2006  enacted  levels,  approximately  a  three  percent  reduction.  The  budget  in-
creases  funding  for  Climate  Research  by  $23  million  (13.5  percent).  However,  most
of this increase is in the competitive research program and is accomplished by redi-
rection of funds from Congressionally-mandated projects.

The 2004 report by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended that Con-
gress double the federal ocean and coastal research budget over the next five years.
No  budget  proposal  since  the  report  was  issued  has  included  substantial  increases
in ocean research funding at NOAA. The FY 2008 budget request is higher than the
President’s FY 2007 request. However, the Administration’s budget once again cuts
the  Ocean,  Coastal,  and  Great  Lakes  Research  account  below  the  FY  2006  appro-
priation  from  $127  million  to  $105  million,  a  17  percent  decrease.  Sea  Grant  re-
ceives a very small increase ($166,000), and the Administration requests an increase
for Ocean Exploration of about $14 million.

National Ocean Service

The President’s FY 2008 request for the National Ocean Service (NOS) would re-
duce  funding  for  NOS  programs  by  over  20  percent.  The  largest  reductions  are  in
the  Ocean  Assessment  program  ($36  million)  and  in  the  Response  and  Restoration
program  ($13  million)  of  the  Ocean  Resources,  Conservation,  and  Assessment  ac-
counts.

Program Support

The  Program  Support  account  includes  the  NOAA  Education  Program.  Overall,
the  Program  Support  account  is  reduced  by  about  10  percent  as  compared  to  the
FY  2006  enacted  level.  Most  of  this  reduction  is  due  to  a  reduction  in  the  procure-
ment  accounts,  but  the  proposed  funding  for  NOAA  education  programs  is  also  re-
duced significantly below the $38 million enacted in FY 2006 to a proposed funding
level of $19 million (an $18 million or 48 percent reduction).

Chairman  GORDON.  Good  morning.  Welcome  to  this  hearing  on
the  Administration’s  Fiscal  Year  2008  Research  and  Development
budget.

Mr. Sensenbrenner was giving me a lesson on Wisconsin driving,
and  unfortunately,  we  don’t  all  have  that,  so  I  know  there  are
going  to  be  some  delays.  Mr.  Hall  is  en  route,  but  has  given  in-
structions  for  us  to  move  forward,  and  that  is  what  we  are  going
to  do.  We  have  the  responsibility  to  do  an  oversight  plan,  and  we
are going to wait until Mr. Hall gets here to go into that.

So,  we  move  forward,  and  thank  you,  Dr.  Marburger.  We  know
you  came  a  long  way  this  morning,  and  had  a  variety  of  barriers,
and  we  thank  you  for  getting  those  behind  you  and  coming  here
with us.

We  are  here  today  to  discuss  the  Administration’s  proposal  for
research and development funding, which really means we are here
to  discuss  our  nation’s  future  competitiveness.  You  have  heard  me
say  this  before,  but  it  continues  to  ring  true.  As  a  father  of  a  five-
year-old daughter, I am deeply concerned that our children will be
the first generation of Americans not to inherit a standard of living
higher than their parents.

We  need  to  get  serious  about  ensuring  that  our  country’s  eco-
nomic  strength  continues  to  be  the  envy  of  the  world.  The  fact  of
the  matter  is,  the  absolute  dollars  that  we  spend  on  research  and
development have been declining as a percent of our economy, and
while  our  investments  have  been  declining,  other  countries  R&D
investments  have  been  increasing.  A  few  years  ago,  South  Korea
overtook the U.S. in total R&D investment as a percentage of GDP;
and  China,  which  is  raising  its  R&D  by  10  percent  a  year,  is  on
the path to closing that gap as well.

And that is why I had hoped to see a budget from the President
this  year  that  recognized  these  realities  and  shored  up  our  coun-
try’s  competitive  position.  But  in  2008,  under  this  budget,  R&D  as
a  share  of  GDP  would  decline  again,  to  below  one  percent,  and
while  the  budget  includes  some  important  funding  increases,  it
lacks  the  priorities  and  consistency  to  ensure  our  competitiveness
now and in the long run.

Proposed  increases  at  some  agencies  are  offset  by  decreases  at
other  agencies.  Physical  science  or  sciences  are  boosted  within  the
American  Competitiveness  Initiatives,  but  more  than  offset  by  de-
creases  to  NASA  science  programs,  and  by  other  cuts.  And  it  is
good  to  see  the  President’s  budget  would  increase  overall  funding
for  the  National  Science  Foundation,  but  once  again,  funding  for
education programs at the NSF would decline.

Over  the  last  four  years,  NSF  K–12  funding  has  dropped  almost
50  percent,  more  than  $130  million,  and  the  2008  budget  request
maintains these cuts. For more than 50 years, the National Science
Foundation  has  been  successfully  implementing  K–12  education
programs.  In  fact,  an  Administration  official  at  OMB  recently
agreed that NSF has ‘‘a strong track record for vigorous evaluation
that  could  be  a  model  for  other  agencies  trying  to  improve  science
and  math  instructions.’’  And  in  testimony,  other  reports  presented
to this committee over the years, including the National Academies
Gathering  Storm  report,  the  number  one  recommendation  for  im-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

12

proving  math  and  science  education  has  been  improving  teacher
training.

Still,  the  Administration  continues  to  ignore  these  facts,  and  in-
stead,  has  focused  70  percent  of  the  education  component  of  its
Competitiveness Initiative on a very narrow area of K–8 math cur-
riculum  at  the  Department  of  Education,  an  agency  that  already
has been overburdened and underfunded. And I would like to make
clear  that  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  agenda  does
not  even  include  a  specific  science  education  component.  This  is  a
case of misplaced priorities, and I am hopeful that the Administra-
tion  will  reconsider  scaling  out  the  considerable  experience  and
success of K–12 programs at NSF.

In  addition,  while  important  physical  science  funding  at  NIST
would  increase,  the  President  continues  to  refuse  to  see  the  value
in  two  bipartisan  supported  programs  that  have  proven  track
records in aiding small businesses and creating new jobs: the Man-
ufacturing  Extension  Partnership,  and  the  Advanced  Technology
Program.  The  President’s  budget  would  cut  MEP  funding  by  more
than  half,  and  let  me  tell  you  what  that  would  mean  in  the  real
world.  It  means  more  than  8,000  small  manufacturing  businesses
will  lose  over  $650  million  in  cost  savings  and  $3  billion  in  sales.
It  means  we  won’t  create  25,000  jobs,  and  given  MEP’s  ten  to  one
return on investment, it means a loss of over $1 billion to the econ-
omy.

And  all  of  this  after  losing  100,000  manufacturing  jobs  last  year
alone, and 2.6 million since the President took office. The President
also,  once  again,  has  proposed  eliminating  funding  for  the  Ad-
vanced  Technology  Program,  66  percent  of  which  goes  to  small
businesses,  and  which  provides  a  return  to  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  of  eight  to  one.  This  is  hardly  a  way  to  maintain  our  eco-
nomic competitiveness in the Twenty First Century.

Finally,  our  country’s  continued  economic  growth  will  depend  on
having access to a clean, secure, reliable, affordable energy supply,
and  I  am  glad  to  see  that  the  budget  would  continue  to  boost  re-
search  funding  for  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science
even above the increases the Office received in 2007. Basic research
can  lay  the  foundation  for  reducing  our  country’s  energy  depend-
ence  and  addressing  the  impacts  of  global  climate  change,  but
today, too much energy R&D never gets beyond the lab.

Unfortunately,  in  the  Administration’s  budget,  several  energy
programs  to  help  develop  and  demonstrate  new  technologies  are
slated for elimination. Others with proven track records would face
significant cuts. Let me give you an example. The Industrial Tech-
nologies Program at DOE sets up partnerships between the govern-
ment  and  industry  to  share  the  cost  in  R&D  and  technological  as-
sistance.  The  program  helps  businesses  reduce  energy  use  and  in-
crease  productivity.  According  to  the  Department  of  Energy’s  own
analysis,  this  program  has  helped  170  new  technologies  enter  the
commercial  marketplace,  and  saved  $23  billion  in  energy  costs.
These  results  should  not  go  unnoticed,  but  they  have  by  this  Ad-
ministration,  which  has  proposed  cutting  the  Industrial  Tech-
nologies Program by 20 percent.

In  short,  we  need  to  get  our  priorities  in  order.  Ten  years  from
now,  I  want  to  look  at  my  daughter  and  know  that  I  did  my  part
to help find the solution to these issues.

Dr.  Marburger,  I  look  forward  to  hearing  your  testimony,  and

discussing these issues further with you in my questions.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

We  are  here  today  to  discuss  the  Administration’s  proposals  for  research  and  de-
velopment  funding,  which  really  means  we  are  here  to  discuss  our  nation’s  future
competitiveness.

You  have  heard  me  say  this  before  but  it  continues  to  ring  true—As  the  father
of a five-year-old daughter, I am deeply concerned that our children will be the first
generation  of  Americans  not  to  inherit  a  better  quality  of  life  than  their  parents.
We  need  to  get  serious  about  ensuring  that  our  country’s  economic  strength  con-
tinues to be the envy of the world.

The fact of the matter is, the absolute dollars we spend on research and develop-

ment have been declining as a percentage of our economy.

And,  while  our  investments  have  been  declining,  other  countries’  R&D  invest-
ments have been increasing. A few years ago, overtook the in total R&D investment
as  a  percentage  of  GDP.  And—which  is  raising  its  R&D  by  10  percent  a  year—is
on the path to closing the gap as well.

That’s  why  I  had  hoped  to  see  a  budget  from  the  President  this  year  that  recog-
nized  these  realities  and  shored  up  our  country’s  competitive  position.  But  in  2008,
under this budget, R&D as a share our GDP would decline again—to below one per-
cent.

While  the  budget  includes  some  important  funding  increases,  it  lacks  the  prior-
ities  and  consistency  to  ensure  our  competitiveness  now  and  in  the  long  run.  Pro-
posed increases at some agencies are offset by decreases at other agencies. Physical
sciences are boosted within the American Competitiveness Initiative, but more than
offset by decreases to NASA science programs, among other cuts.

It’s good to see that the President’s budget would increase overall funding for the

National Science Foundation.

But  once  again,  funding  for  education  programs  at  NSF  would  decline.  Over  the
last four years, NSF K–12 funding has dropped almost 50 percent, more than $130
million. And the 2008 budget request maintains these cuts.

For  more  than  50  years,  the  National  Science  Foundation  has  been  successfully
implementing K–12 education programs. In fact, an Administration official at OMB
recently  agreed  that  NSF  has  a—quote—‘‘strong  track  record  for  rigorous  evalua-
tion’’  that  could  be  a  model  for  other  agencies  trying  to  improve  science  and  math
instruction.

And, in testimony and other reports presented to this committee over the years—
including  the  National  Academies  Gathering  Storm  report—the  number  one  rec-
ommendation for improving math and science education has been improving teacher
training.

Still,  the  Administration  continues  to  ignore  these  facts  and  instead  has  focused
70  percent  of  the  education  component  of  its  competitiveness  initiative  on  the  very
narrow  area  of  K–8  math  curriculum  at  the  Department  of  Education—an  agency
that already has been overburdened and underfunded.

I would like to make clear that the American Competitiveness Initiative does not

even include a specific science education component.

This  is  a  case  of  misplaced  priorities,  and  I  am  hopeful  that  the  Administration
will  reconsider  scaling  out  the  considerable  experience  and  success  of  K–12  pro-
grams at NSF.

In  addition,  while  important  physical  sciences  funding  at  NIST  would  increase,
the President continues to refuse to see the value in two programs that have a prov-
en  track  record  of  aiding  small  businesses  and  creating  new  jobs—the  Manufac-
turing Extension Partnership and Advanced Technology Program.

The  President’s  budget  would  cut  M–E–P  funding  by  more  than  half.  Let  me  tell

you what that means in the real world—

lion in cost savings and $3 billion in sales.

It means more than 8,000 small manufacturing businesses will lose over $650 mil-

It means we won’t create 25,000 jobs.
And,  given  M–E–P’s  ten  to  one  return  on  investment,  it  means  a  loss  of  over  $1

billion to the economy.

And  all  of  this  after  losing  100,000  manufacturing  jobs  last  year  alone,  and  2.6

million since the President took office.

The President also once again has proposed eliminating funding for the Advanced
Technology  Program—66  percent  of  which  goes  to  small  businesses  and  which  pro-

Finally, our country’s continued economic growth will depend on having access to

a clean, secure, reliable and affordable energy supply.

I’m  glad  to  see  that  the  budget  would  continue  to  boost  research  funding  for  the
Department of Energy Office of Science, even above the increases the office will re-
ceive in 2007.

Basic  research  can  lay  the  foundation  for  reducing  our  country’s  energy  depend-

ergy R&D never gets beyond the lab.

develop  and  demonstrate  new  technologies  are  slated  for  elimination.  Others  with
proven track records would face significant cuts.

Let me give you an example—
The  Industrial  Technologies  program  at  DOE  sets  up  partnerships  between  the
government  and  industry  to  share  the  costs  of  R&D  and  technical  assistance.  The
program helps businesses reduce energy use and increase productivity.

According  to  the  Department  of  Energy’s  own  analysis,  this  program  has  helped
170  new  technologies  enter  the  commercial  marketplace,  and  saved  $23  billion  in
energy costs.

These  results  should  not  go  unnoticed—but  they  have  by  this  Administration,

which has proposed cutting the Industrial Technologies program by 20 percent.

In short, we need to get our priorities in order.
Ten years from now, I want to look at my daughter and know that I did my part
to help find a solution to these issues. Dr. Marburger, I look forward to hearing your
testimony, and discussing these issues further with you in my questions.

Chairman  GORDON.  At  this  time,  I  will  recognize  our  distin-

guished Ranking Member, Mr. Hall, for an opening statement.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  good  morning,  Dr.

I  read  this  opening  statement  to  you  the  first  time  I  have  read

it to myself. Thank you for being here.

I  am  sure  that  we  are  all  in  agreement  that  we  are  challenged
with achieving a very delicate balance between adequately funding
our nation’s priorities, while at the same time exhibiting fiscal con-
straint and in an effort to reduce the deficit, and to bring our budg-
et under control.

Likewise,  I  know  we  are  all  in  agreement  that  if  we  remain  the
world  leader  in  competitiveness  and  innovation,  we  have  to  make
the  appropriate  investments  in  research,  development,  technology,
and math and science education.

I am pleased to see that the fiscal year 2008 budget request con-
tinues  to  build  upon  many  elements  of  the  President’s  American
Competitiveness  Initiative,  particularly  with  regard  to  substan-
tially  increasing  the  funding  for  physical  sciences  and  engineering
at  the  National  Science  Foundation,  the  National  Institute  of
Science  and  Technology,  and  the  Office  of  Science  at  the  Depart-
ment of Energy.

The returns that we receive from our investments in these agen-
cies  far  exceed  the  cost,  whether  it  is  fighting  the  war  on  terror
abroad or at home, ending our dependence on foreign oil, or inspir-
ing our children to enter high tech fields, so that the United States
can  continue  to  push  the  frontiers  of  innovation,  these  agencies
have  critical  roles  to  play.  I  am  especially  pleased  to  see  the  Ad-
vanced Energy Initiative at the Department of Energy is funded at

$2.7  billion  in  the  fiscal  year  2008  budget,  a  26  percent  increase
over the fiscal year 2007 request.

As I have said on many occasions, America needs to be more en-
ergy  independent,  and  federal  programs  such  as  these,  combined
with  private  sector  initiatives,  will  help  us  achieve  this  goal.
Whether  we  explore  hydrogen  fuel  cells,  cellulosic  ethanol,  clean
coal  technology,  or  advancements  in  oil  and  gas  drilling,  we  are
moving  America  away  from  a  dependence  on  foreign  oil  and  in-
creasing our national competitiveness.

I  am  also  pleased  to  see  an  increase  over  the  fiscal  year  2007
budget  for  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration.
NOAA  provides  valuable  national  services,  including  the  weather
forecasts  and  warnings  that  affect  the  daily  lives  of  every  citizen.
As  for  NASA,  a  3.1  percent  increase  is  good,  but  it  still  may  not
be  sufficient  to  ensure  that  we  meet  the  2014  goal  to  launch  the
new Crew Exploration Vehicle. Mike Griffin is doing a great job at
NASA, but the Administration must acknowledge that the budgets
being provided to him are fostering additional delays in fielding the
new Exploration Vehicle. I hope you can address my concerns that
further  reductions  in  exploration  systems  funding  will  jeopardize
the transition from the Shuttle to the CEV.

I  am  hopeful  our  committee  will  continue  to  examine  the  effects
of underfunding this very vital and important initiative, and I cer-
tainly look forward to your testimony, sir.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RALPH M. HALL

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  morning,  Dr.  Marburger.  It’s  good  to  have  you

before us this morning.

I  am  sure  that  we  are  all  in  agreement  that  we  are  challenged  with  achieving
a  delicate  balance  between  adequately  funding  our  nation’s  priorities  while  at  the

I  am  pleased  to  see  that  the  FY  2008  Budget  Request  continues  to  build  upon
many  elements  of  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI),  par-
ticularly  with  regard  to  substantially  increasing  the  funding  for  physical  sciences
and  engineering  at  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF),  the  National  Institute
of  Science  and  Technology  (NIST),  and  the  Office  of  Science  at  the  Department  of
Energy (DOE). The returns that we receive from our investments in these agencies
far  exceed  the  costs.  Whether  it  is  fighting  the  war  on  terror  abroad  or  at  home,

fields  so  that  the  United  States  can  continue  to  push  the  frontiers  of  innovation,
these agencies have critical roles to play.

I am especially pleased to see that the Advanced Energy Initiative at the Depart-
ment  of  Energy  is  funded  at  $2.7  billion  in  the  FY  2008  budget—a  26  percent  in-
crease over the FY 2007 request. As I have said on many occasions, America needs
to  be  more  energy  independent  and  federal  programs  such  as  these,  combined  with

Chairman GORDON. Dr. Marburger, if you will give us just a mo-
ment. We have got to do some Committee business before we start
the hearing.

And  pursuant  to  notice,  the  Committee  will  now  consider  for
adoption  the  oversight  plan  for  the  110th  Congress.  According  to
the  Rules  of  the  House,  the  Committee  must  adopt  its  oversight
agenda in an open meeting of the Committee. You have before you
the  text  of  the  oversight  plan  for  the  110th.  The  text  incorporates
all  suggestions,  additions,  and  changes  made  at  the  request  of  the
minority.  I  would  also  like  to  note  that  the  adoption  of  this  plan
does  not  preclude  oversight  or  investigation  of  additional  matters
as the need arises.

I  now  recognize  Mr.  Hall  for  any  comments  he  might  like  to

Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. Thank you, and I appre-
ciate the fact that you incorporated the suggested changes that we
made,  and  appreciate  your  staff  working  with  us  the  way  they
have,  and  I  thank  you  for  your  help  and  accommodation  on  this
issue.

And  we  are  prepared  to  adopt  this  oversight  agenda  this  morn-

ing. I think there will be no opposition from this side.

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall. I hope this is an exam-

ple of how we are going to work together in every way possible.

I  thank  the  distinguished  gentleman  for  his  comments.  The
Chair will order the previous question, on the adoption of the over-
sight plan.

The question on adoption of the oversight plan for the 110th Con-
gress.  All  those  in  favor  say  aye.  Aye.  Those  opposed,  say  nay.  In
the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.

Okay. I ask unanimous consent that all additional opening state-
ments  submitted  by  the  Committee  Members  be  included  in  the
record. Without objection, so ordered.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  morning.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  calling  this  hearing  to  consider  the
President’s fiscal year 2008 (FY08) budget proposal for federal research and develop-
ment (R&D) programs.

Energy  security  and  investments  in  science,  technology,  and  innovation  are  crit-
ical  to  our  fight  to  stay  competitive  in  the  global  marketplace  and  to  develop  clean
energy technologies to meet our future energy needs. Adequate funding must be pro-
vided  to  meet  these  important  goals,  and  I  believe  greater  congressional  oversight
is  needed  to  ensure  government  agencies  are  correctly  implementing  federal  R&D
programs.

The  President’s  budget  proposes  $143  billion  in  federal  R&D  funding  which  rep-
resents  a  slight  increase  over  the  anticipated  FY07  level.  First,  the  fossil  energy
R&D  budget,  which  includes  funding  for  coal  programs,  received  $557  million  in
FY08,  a  two  percent  increase  compared  to  FY07.  While  the  coal  budget  appears  ro-
bust,  a  good  portion  of  the  funding  for  FY  2008  is  derived  from  previously  appro-
priated  clean  coal  funds,  including  funding  for  FutureGen.  Therefore,  only  $15  mil-
lion  can  be  considered  ‘‘new’’  funding  for  clean  coal  programs.  I  am  opposed  to  the
rescission  of  these  funds  and  I  will  work  with  my  colleagues  on  both  sides  of  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

aisle  to  restore  this  funding.  Coal  is  our  most  economical  and  abundant  domestic
resource, with a 250-year supply, and will be the mainstay for electricity generation
into  the  foreseeable  future.  I  believe  Congress  must  continue  to  support  a  robust
coal budget in order to improve coal use by supporting advancements in technology
to reduce emissions of both criteria pollutants and carbon dioxide.

Further,  within  the  President’s  proposed  DOE  budget,  a  slight  funding  increase
is  provided  for  the  Carbon  Sequestration  Program  to  develop  a  portfolio  of  tech-
nologies  that  hold  great  potential  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  State  of
Illinois  is  one  of  seven  regional  carbon  sequestration  research  partners  funded  by
the Department of Energy. To date, research has shown that the geology in the Illi-
nois  Basin  is  favorable  for  geological  sequestration  and  pilot  tests  are  needed  to
demonstrate  efficiency  and  carry  out  safety  evaluations  of  burying  carbon  dioxide
underground.  I  am  concerned  that  the  President’s  budget  proposal  significantly  de-
creases  the  number  of  small  scale  demonstrations  planned  for  Phase  III  of  the  re-
gional carbon sequestration partnership. For Illinois, verifying the safety and capac-
ity  of  geological  sequestration  through  the  Partnership  research  is  key  to  revital-
izing  our  coal  industry,  implementing  the  most  advanced  coal  gasification  tech-
nology,  and  making  economic  and  meaningful  carbon  dioxide  emissions  reductions.
Second, I am pleased the President’s budget provides $9 billion in loan guarantees
for  clean  energy  and  innovative  technologies  authorized  in  Title  17  of  the  Energy
Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT). This is a step in the right direction, but a much bigger
step  is  needed  to  make  a  real  difference  in  the  development  of  clean  energy  tech-
nologies.  When  Congress  created  this  loan  guarantee  program  in  EPACT  2005,  we
envisioned  a  significantly  more  ambitious  scope  for  the  loan  guarantees.  This  pro-
gram  provides  incentives  for  clean  energy  projects  that  are  critical  in  the  fight
against  pollution  or  global  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  Implementation  of  this
program  at  the  scale  envisioned  in  EPACT  2005  could  be  a  significant  step  toward
addressing  the  challenge  of  global  climate  change,  with  little  or  no  cost  to  the  fed-
eral treasury.

Third, the Bush administration’s ‘‘American Competitiveness Initiative’’ as part of
the Office of Science represents an increase of $602 million, or 15.9 percent over the
FY07. To build on our successes and remain a leader in science and technology, our
federal  policies  must  elevate  and  promote  new  levels  of  educational  achievement
and  focus  on  efforts  to  produce  a  skilled  and  knowledgeable  workforce.  With  the
right policies and adequate funding support, we will maintain America’s competitive
edge,  we  will  create  more  jobs,  and  will  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  standard
of living for generations to come.

Finally,  I  am  concerned  that  the  single  best  government  program  to  provide  im-
mediate help to U.S. manufacturers, the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP),
is severely cut again this year. MEP is the only federal program with a proven track
record  in  creating  and  retaining  manufacturing  jobs;  yet,  the  Administration  pro-
poses  to  cut  MEP  by  56  percent.  Annually,  the  Illinois  Manufacturing  Extension
Center (IMEC) provides assistance to about 450 small and mid-sized manufacturers.
These  companies  reported  an  average  cost  savings  of  $179,000  with  IMEC’s  assist-
ance.  Year  after  year,  MEP  Centers  struggle  to  survive  rather  than  focus  on  what
they  do  best:  helping  businesses  increase  efficiency  and  productivity  in  order  to  be
competitive in the global marketplace.

I welcome our witness and look forward to his testimony.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carnahan follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding today’s hearing on the President’s proposed

research and development budget.

I  share  the  Chairman’s  opinion  that  there  are  various  positive  increases  in  the
R&D budget in the areas of competitiveness and innovation, specifically in basic re-
search  in  the  Department  of  Energy  and  the  National  Science  Foundation.  At  the
same time, other necessary programs have received decreased funding to account for
these adjustments.

I  am  particularly  concerned  about  proposed  cuts  in  some  of  the  Nation’s  energy
efficiency  and  renewable  energy  programs.  We  owe  it  to  our  children  to  invest  in
energy  research  now  so  that  we  can  develop  needed  technologies  to  increase  com-
petitiveness  and  decrease  the  affects  of  pollution  on  global  warming  in  the  future.
I  am  pleased  that  the  Chairman  has  again  put  forward  his  innovation  package
and  believe  its  consideration  will  allow  this  committee  to  more  appropriately  allo-

nity was delighted to host Mr. Gordon for a panel discussion on innovation last Au-
gust. I look forward to participating actively in future debate.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  your  testimony,  Dr.  Marburger.  Thank  you  very  much

for being here today.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Mitchell follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE HARRY E. MITCHELL

Dr. Marburger, thank you for coming today. I look forward to your testimony.
Unfortunately, America is struggling to keep pace with the international commu-
nity  in  technological  advances.  To  win  this  race  and  remain  a  technological  leader,
we must focus more attention on students and investment in research and develop-
ment. If we don’t invest now and invest well, we will fall even further behind.

ASU  has  a  large  presence  in  my  district  and  is  a  prominent  leader  in  this  fight
to maintain global competitiveness. That is why I am pleased to see that the Presi-
dent’s  proposed  budget  includes  an  increase  for  NASA  and  the  National  Science
Foundation (NSF) above the Fiscal Year 2007 levels. Both agencies fund the univer-
sity through contracts and grants.

While I am pleased with to see this funding increase, I am concerned about some

of the President’s funding priorities.

Investing  in  short-  and  long-term  research  and  development  today  is  a  dual  ben-
efit. For example, improving technologies for energy efficiency and vehicle emissions
benefits both the environment and the economy.

As such funding should be well-targeted to meet not only current needs but future

research and development projects.

The  federal  budget  proposal  which  we  are  hearing  about  today  highlights  a  lack

of commitment by our government to dedicate itself to this goal.

The future of American leadership in science and technology is heavily dependent
on  ensuring  the  competitiveness  future  generations.  As  a  retired  teacher  with  28
years  of  experience,  I  understand  the  importance  of  education.  For  this  reason,  the
FY 2008 budget’s proposed overall cuts to K–12 education are particularly alarming.
It  seems  like  the  Administration  has  saved  us  some  money  now,  but  cuts  made
to  lower  education  programs  are  going  to  cost  us  in  the  global  economy  down  the
road.

Therefore  a  focus  on  long  term  research  and  development  must  be  a  priority.  If
we don’t step up our commitment, we will lose the opportunity to compete in critical
technologies.  To  maintain  America’s  competitiveness  in  science  and  technology,  we
must  keep  up  investment  and,  more  importantly,  encourage  future  leaders  in  the
field.

I  hope  this  committee. . .a  distinguished  committee. . .with  a  long  tradition  of

fairness and bipartisanship. . .will address this at the appropriate time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE VERNON J. EHLERS

I  am  pleased  that  Dr.  Marburger  is  with  us  today  to  share  the  Administration’s
request  for  research  and  development  in  the  FY08  budget.  I  know  that  there  are
many  competing  national  priorities,  including  securing  the  homeland,  providing  for
our aging population, and maintaining a vibrant national economy.

For  the  past  several  years,  research  and  development  funding  for  defense,  weap-
ons  development  and  national  security  has  increased  while  other  areas  of  federal
research and development, especially basic research in the physical sciences, has re-
mained flat or declined in real terms. Last year’s FY 2007 request sought to reverse
this  trend,  and  House  appropriators  supported  the  increases  requested  by  the  Ad-
ministration for three important agencies: the National Science Foundation, the De-
partment of Energy’s Office of Science, and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. I am thankful that the requests for the ‘‘American Competitiveness Ini-
tiative’’  are  continued  in  FY08,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  my  colleagues
on  the  authorizing  and  appropriating  committees  to  make  the  funding  levels  re-
quested a reality.

While I am heartened by the requested funds for NSF, I am concerned about the
status of the Education and Human Resources (EHR) budget at the Foundation, in-
cluding  the  Math  and  Science  Partnership  program.  There  is  a  continuing,  but  dis-
tressing,  trend  for  NSF  to  move  away  from  its  K–12  educational  mission  and  to
focus solely on graduate education and activities to broaden participation in science,
technology,  engineering  and  math  (STEM)  fields.  For  the  first  time  in  years  the
Math  and  Science  Partnership  program  will  potentially  be  able  to  make  some  new

grants  this  year  instead  of  being  eliminated  as  in  recent  budgets.  With  more  than
50  years  of  experience,  decreasing  the  role  of  NSF  in  education  seems  shortsighted
when we are currently facing the challenge of adequately preparing our students to
enter science and technology fields.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RANDY NEUGEBAUER

Mr. Chairman:

Thank you for holding this hearing. I welcome the opportunity to take part in this

important discussion and look forward to hearing from Dr. Marburger.

President Bush’s budget proposal represents a good starting point for Congress as
we  begin  to  set  funding  priorities  for  2008.  I  think  we  all  realize  the  value  of  sci-
entific  research  and  funding  and  how  it  directly  impacts  Americans.  Continued  sci-
entific  research  and  development  gives  our  troops  the  tools  to  have  the  necessary
technology to more safely fight the War on Terror, protects Americans’ security here
at home, provides the opportunity to help reduce our dependence on foreign sources
of energy, and improves everyday conveniences such as reliable weather forecasting.
Given  this,  we  are  also  on  target  to  balance  the  budget.  It  is  imperative  that  we
keep  pursuing  this  goal  by  limiting  unnecessary  spending  and  continue  to  provide
tax relief that has allowed our economy to thrive. We must be responsible stewards
of  the  taxpayers’  money  and  ensure  that  money  is  not  spent  in  a  wasteful  manner.
We  in  Congress  have  a  responsibility  to  show  spending  restraint  and  make  sure
that federal money is used in a responsible and efficient manner.

I welcome the opportunity to work with the Administration and my colleagues on
the  Science  Committee  to  achieve  our  common  goal  of  scientific  advancement  while
also being fiscally responsible.

Chairman GORDON. And now, Mr. Marburger, thank you. We are
pleased that you have joined us as the Science Advisor to the Presi-
dent  and  Director  of  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy.
Before  his  appointment  to  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President,
Dr.  Marburger  served  in  a  very  distinguished  way  as  the  Director
of  the  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory,  and  as  President  of  the
State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Dr.  Marburger,  we  greatly  appreciate  you  adjusting  your  sched-

ule in order to be with us today.

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN H. MARBURGER, III, DIRECTOR,

OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Thank  you,  sir,  and  it  is  a  great  pleasure  for
me to be here. Chairman Gordon and Ranking Republican Member
Hall, and Members of the Committee, I am very pleased to appear
today  to  present  the  President’s  Fiscal  Year  2008  Research  Devel-
opment Budget.

This  committee  has  been  a  strong  and  reliable  supporter  of  the
Nation’s  science  mission,  and  on  behalf  of  the  Administration,  I
thank  the  Committee  for  the  good  working  relationship  it  has  es-
tablished  with  the  science  agencies  and  with  my  office,  and  I  look
forward to working together in the future to advance American in-
novation  and  competitiveness.  I  very  much  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity to make these points.

I have submitted an extensive written testimony that I ask be in-
cluded in the record, and I will briefly present some of the themes
of that statement.

President  Bush’s  determination  to  balance  the  federal  budget  in
five  years  requires  setting  priorities  and  allocating  resources  to
achieve  the  greatest  impact.  Winning  the  war  on  terror,  securing
the  homeland,  and  strengthening  the  economy  remain  the  Presi-

20

dent’s  top  priorities,  and  this  year’s  budget  once  again  emphasizes
investments  in  America’s  future  competitiveness  through  research
and development.

The  President  is  proposing  a  record  $142.7  billion  R&D  budget,
which is an increase of $5.5 billion over the 2007 budget. While the
non-defense  discretionary  budget  grows  by  less  than  a  percent  rel-
ative  to  the  2007  levels  in  the  current  continuing  resolution,  non-
defense  R&D  is  increased  by  4.25  percent,  or  nearly  seven  times
faster. While significant increases have occurred for defense-related
development,  most  of  the  D  in  R&D,  I  do  want  to  emphasize  that
non-defense  research  spending  has  grown  significantly  during  this
Administration, as shown in the chart that I have placed—my able
assistant has placed before you.

With  the  2008  budget,  real  growth  (that  is,  not  taking  inflation
into account) in outlays for the non-defense R&D budget is up 26.5
percent  in  seven  years  during  this  Administration.  As  you  know,
President Bush has advanced a strong agenda for science and tech-
nology in his recent State of the Union messages. Last year’s Amer-
ican  Competitiveness  and  Advanced  Energy  Initiatives,  and  this
year’s discussion of the importance of research and development to
our  future  energy  independence  define  priorities  in  research  and
development,  science  and  math  education,  and  other  technology
themes that are reflected in this year’s R&D budget request.

One of those themes is an emphasis on basic research, which re-
ceives  almost  $1  billion  above  the  last  appropriated  level  of  2006.
That  is  $28.4  billion  compared  with  $27.5  billion.  This  favorable
treatment of basic research is occurring in a year of belt-tightening
for many other domestic programs, indicating the high priority this
administration places on the importance of this activity.

The  broader  category  known  as  the  federal  science  and  tech-
nology  budget,  which  goes  beyond  basic  research  to  capture  other
activities  relevant  to  competitiveness,  advances  by  $1.3  billion  in
2008 relative to fiscal year 2006 levels. And when only civilian S&T
agencies  are  considered,  that  represents  a  4  percent  increase.  If
Congress  funds  the  President’s  2008  request,  and  avoids  ear-
marking  this  category,  the  FS&T  funds,  federal  science  and  tech-
nology  funds  available  for  science  agency  programs,  will  increase
by $1.5 billion from the President’s own 2007 budget request.

The  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  remains  an  important
part of this year’s R&D budget request. As you know, the ACI iden-
tifies  three  priority  science  agencies  that  have  already  been  men-
tioned in opening statements, the National Science Foundation, the
Department  of  Energy’s  Office  of  Science,  and  the  laboratories  of
the  National  Institutes  of  Standards  and  Technologies.  The  2008
budget  calls  for  a  7.2  percent  increase  on  top  of  2007’s  9.3  percent
requested  increase.  This  additional  $764  million  brings  the  total
two year ACI research incremental investment to $2.6 billion addi-
tional funding.

Mr.  Chairman,  as  I  prepared  this  testimony,  the  then-current
draft of the Fiscal Year 2007 continuing budget resolution, the CR,
provides  only  about  half  of  the  first  year  ACI  budget,  about  $452
million short. I think the chart shows $454, but it is actually $452
million short of the President’s request, and I know this committee
is  as  disappointed  as  I  am  at  this  shortfall  for  science,  and  if  not

corrected  before  completion  of  the  fiscal  year  ’07  process,  which  I
am  afraid  is  nearing  completion  now,  a  year  of  enhanced  and  ex-
panded high impact innovation research will be lost, and a $1.2 bil-
lion  increase  would  be  required  in  2008  to  catch  up  to  the  Presi-
dent’s  commitment.  I  think  this  would  be  a  difficult  12  percent  in-
crease in 2008.

Well, in the past, the management of science programs has been
made more difficult by the practice of earmarking. I know this com-
mittee  already  fully  appreciates  the  earmarking  problem  and  sup-
ports best practices in the allocation of research funding. As we dis-
cuss  the  importance  of  pursuing  the  best  science  to  contribute  to
U.S.  competitiveness,  I  hope  the  Congress  will  eliminate  research
earmarks  in  the  fiscal  year  ’08  appropriations  process,  as  it  is  so
commendably doing in a spirit of reform for the current fiscal year.
Other important areas of research increased or sustained in this
budget  include  climate-related  science  and  technology,  environ-
mental  systems,  Earth  observation  systems,  the  Advanced  Energy
Initiative. I know my time is up, but I would direct your attention
to my written testimony for detailed statements of these areas, and
also, of the detailed agency budgets under the purview of this com-
mittee.

Before I conclude this very brief and incomplete summary of the
large and complex R&D budget, I do want to flag a concern regard-
ing  NASA  and  the  budget  danger  that  lies  ahead  for  this  agency,
already  flagged  by  Ranking  Member  Hall.  The  President’s  budget
includes  a  3.1  percent  increase  for  NASA,  on  top  of  a  3.4  percent
requested  increase  for  ’07.  However,  the  2007  full  year  continuing
resolution, as it stands now, cuts NASA by more than a half a bil-
lion dollars from the President’s request, which leaves NASA at its
’06  level,  with  no  increase,  and  puts  at  risk  the  Vision  for  Space
Exploration and priority Earth and space science missions.

Mr.  Chairman,  America  continues  to  lead  the  world  in  the  qual-
ity  and  quantity  of  the  science  it  produces.  We  lead  not  only  in
science,  but  also  in  translating  science  to  economically  significant
products that enhance the quality of life for all people. This budget
will  sustain  this  leadership,  and  maintain  science  and  technology
capabilities that are the envy of the world, and I ask that Congress
fully fund the initiatives advanced in the President’s proposal.

Thank you for permitting me to make these statements.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Marburger follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN H. MARBURGER, III

Chairman  Gordon,  Ranking  Republican  Member  Hall,  and  Members  of  the  Com-
mittee,  I  am  pleased  to  appear  before  you  today  to  present  the  President’s  Fiscal
Year 2008 research and development (R&D) budget. Although this is my sixth year
coming before the Committee to discuss the President’s R&D program, it is my first
under  the  new  Congressional  leadership.  I  am  aware  that  this  committee  has  ex-
pressed  bipartisan  support  for  science  funding  in  the  past,  and  values  scientific  re-
search and its applications for the benefits it brings to every part of our society. On
behalf of the Administration, I thank the Committee for the good working relation-
ship  it  has  established  with  the  science  agencies  and  with  my  office,  and  look  for-
ward  to  working  together  in  the  future  to  advance  American  innovation  and  com-
petitiveness.

This  year,  President  Bush  presents  a  Federal  Budget  that  will  balance  in  five
years.  The  President  proposes  to  do  this  by  continuing  strong  pro-growth  economic
policies  and  by  holding  non-security  discretionary  spending  below  inflation.  This
strategy  inevitably  requires  establishing  priorities  and  allocating  resources  to

achieve the greatest impact. Winning the war on terror, securing the homeland and
strengthening  the  economy  remain  the  President’s  top  priorities,  and  this  year’s
budget  once  again  emphasizes  investments  in  America’s  future  competitiveness
through  research  and  development.  The  President  is  proposing  a  record  $142.7  bil-
lion  2008  Federal  R&D  Budget,  an  increase  of  $5.5  billion  over  the  2007  Budget.
And  while  the  overall  2008  non-defense  discretionary  budget  grows  by  on  0.65  per-
cent  relative  to  the  2007  levels  in  the  current  continuing  resolution,  non-defense
R&D  is  increased  by  4.26  percent,  or  almost  seven  times  faster.  The  President’s
commitment  to  the  government’s  R&D  enterprise  is  strong,  and  the  advancement
of science remains among his top budget priorities.

While  significant  increases  have  occurred  for  defense-related  development—most
of the ‘‘D’’ in R&D—it is important to be aware of the very significant growth during
this Administration in non-defense research spending, as shown in an accompanying
chart. Non-defense R&D has continued on a significantly upward trajectory. In fact,
with  President  Bush’s  2008  Budget,  real  growth  in  outlays  for  the  conduct  of  non-
defense R&D—i.e., corrected for inflation—is up 26.5 percent in seven years during
this Administration.

With  the  launch  of  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI)  last  year  and
further  discussion  of  the  importance  of  research  and  development  to  our  future  en-
ergy  independence  this  year,  President  Bush’s  recent  State  of  the  Union  addresses
advance a strong agenda for science and technology. This focus on research and de-
velopment,  science  and  math  education,  and  other  technology  themes  directly  sup-
ports our national goals of securing the Nation, protecting the homeland, and mak-
ing the economy strong.

Before I get into the specifics of this year’s research budget, I want to express my
concern  about  the  very  serious  deleterious  impacts  of  earmarking  on  the  science
budget. I do this knowing that this committee already fully appreciates the problem
and supports best practices in the allocation of research funding. As we discuss the
importance of pursuing the best science to contribute to U.S. competitiveness, I hope
the Congress will eliminate research earmarks in the FY 2008 appropriations proc-
ess,  as  it  is  so  commendably  doing  in  a  spirit  of  reform  for  the  current  fiscal  year.
The 2008 Budget raises funding for the category of Basic Research almost $1 bil-
lion above the last appropriated level of 2006: $28.4 billion compared with $27.5 bil-
lion. Since the effect of last year’s earmarks only enhance this difference and make
the  real  programmatic  increases  even  bigger,  in  my  view  this  is  a  direct  indication
of  the  Administration’s  strong  focus  on  fundamental  research  and  the  discovery  of
new  knowledge  as  a  leading  mission  of  the  Federal  Government.  It  is  notable  that
this  favorable  treatment  of  Basic  Research  is  occurring  in  a  year  of  belt-tightening
for  many  other  domestic  programs,  indicating  the  high  priority  this  Administration
places on the importance of this activity.

Basic Research is not the complete measure of investment activities that drive fu-
ture  innovation.  The  accounting  category  known  as  the  Federal  Science  and  Tech-
nology  Budget  emphasizes  both  basic  and  applied  science  and  engineering  research
short of development, and thus captures other important activities relevant to com-
petitiveness  This  category  advances  $1.3  billion  in  2008  relative  to  FY  2006  levels,
and when only civilian S&T agencies are considered, that represents a four percent
increase.  If  Congress  funds  the  President’s  2008  request  and  avoids  earmarking,
FS&T  funds  available  for  science  agency  programs  will  increase  $1.5  billion  from
the President’s own 2007 Budget.

As the next now-familiar chart displays, the American Competitiveness Initiative
identifies  three  priority  science  agencies:  the  National  Science  Foundation;  DOE’s
Office  of  Science;  and  the  laboratories  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and
Technology.  The  2008  Budget  calls  for  a  7.2  percent  increase  on  top  of  2007’s  9.3
percent  requested  increase.  This  additional  $764  million  brings  the  total  two-year
ACI Research incremental investment to $2.6 billion.

As  I  prepared  this  testimony,  the  then-current  draft  of  the  FY  2007  Continuing
Budget  Resolution  (CR)  provides  only  50  percent  of  the  first-year  ACI  budget.  As
you  can  see  on  this  table,  that  is  $452  million  short  of  the  President’s  request.  I
know  this  committee  is  as  disappointed  as  I  am  at  this  shortfall  for  science.  The
Statement of Administration Policy on the continuing resolution makes clear this is
not  sufficient  to  meet  America’s  competitiveness  challenge,  and  falls  short  of  the
doubling  path  that  is  an  important  component  of  the  Initiative.  If  not  corrected  be-
fore  completion  of  the  FY  2007  process,  a  year  of  enhanced  and  expanded  high-im-
pact  innovation  research  will  be  lost  and  a  $1.2  billion  increase  would  be  required
in  2008  to  ‘‘catch-up’’  to  the  President’s  commitment.  This  would  require  a  difficult
12 percent increase in 2008.

While  future  competitiveness  is  the  featured  priority  goal  in  this  science  budget,
other science areas remain important to our nation’s goals. Since 2002, the Adminis-

tration  has  spent  approximately  $9  billion  on  climate  change  science  research
through  the  multi-agency  Climate  Change  Science  Program,  and  the  President’s
2008 Budget sustains the level of effort. Further, between 2003 and 2006, the Presi-
dent has committed nearly $3 billion annually to the climate change technology re-
search  and  deployment  programs  that  constitute  the  multi-agency  Climate  Tech-
nology  Program.  The  U.S.  leads  the  world  in  advancing  climate  science  and  tech-
nology,  with  expenditures  of  nearly  $29  billion  in  climate-related  science,  tech-
nology, international assistance, and incentive programs during this Administration.
Undoubtedly  previous  investments  in  energy-related  science  and  technology  have
put  the  U.S.  well  on  track  to  meet  the  President’s  goal  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas
intensity  18  percent  by  2012.  In  other  programs  relevant  to  the  environment,  the
2008 Budget includes funding for a number of related Earth Observations programs
including  ocean  observing  systems,  earthquake  monitoring  and  prediction,  tsunami
warnings,  Landsat,  and  the  Global  Precipitation  Measurement  mission.  This  year’s
budget also includes a new Ocean Initiative with over $80 million in new 2008 fund-
ing for ocean science and research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration, NSF and the U.S. Geological Survey.

Biomedical  research  is  supported  in  the  2008  NIH  Budget  with  an  increase  of
$431  million  over  the  2007  request.  This  will  allow  NIH  to  award  over  10,000  new
and  competing  research  grants,  an  increase  of  more  than  900,  and  will  double  the
New  Investigators  program.  The  NIH  Director’s  Roadmap  Initiative  is  increased  10
percent  in  2008  to  enhance  this  interdisciplinary  incubator  for  new  ideas  that  will
accelerate the pace of discovery across the NIH’s 27 Institutes and Centers.

The  Advanced  Energy  Initiative  (AEI)  at  DOE  is  funded  at  $2.7  billion  in  the
2008  Budget,  which  is  a  26  percent  increase  over  the  President’s  2007  request  and
almost  $1  billion  more  than  2006.  The  AEI  will  contribute  to  the  President’s  goal
of  cutting  gasoline  use  by  20  percent  in  10  years  by  accelerating  the  technical  and
cost viability of plug-in hybrids, hydrogen-powered fuel cells, and ‘‘cellulosic’’ ethanol
derived  from  biomass.  AEI  will  also  accelerate  clean  electricity  generation  tech-
nologies  such  as  solar,  wind,  nuclear,  and  clean  coal.  Perhaps  most  critically,  the
2008  AEI  includes  over  $700  million  in  basic  research  at  DOE’s  Office  of  Science,
a  32  percent  increase,  to  overcome  major  technical  barriers  to  the  use  of  solar,  bio-
mass,  hydrogen  and  fusion.  With  the  2008  Budget,  the  Presidential  commitment  to
invest  $2  billion  on  clean  coal  research  is  fulfilled,  as  is  President  Bush’s  commit-
ment to propose a five-year, $1.2 billion Hydrogen Fuel Initiative.

This  Administration’s  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  also  strongly  continues
with $1.45 billion in 2008 for this multi-agency, well-coordinated investment in fun-
damental  research,  multi-disciplinary  centers  of  excellence,  and  development  of  fo-
cused  cutting-edge  research  and  education  infrastructure.  With  the  2008  request,
over $8 billion will have been spent on nanoscale R&D in seven years. The NNI also
supports activities addressing the societal implications of nanotechnology, including
those related to human and environmental health and methods for managing poten-
tial risks.

Finally,  let  me  finish  by  expressing  a  concern  regarding  NASA  and  the  budget
danger  that  lies  ahead  for  this  agency.  The  President’s  FY  2008  Budget  includes  a
3.1  percent  increase  for  NASA  in  2008  on  top  of  the  President’s  3.4  percent  re-
quested  increase  for  2007.  However,  the  2007  full-year  CR  as  it  stands  now  cuts
NASA $545 million from the President’s request. That leaves NASA at its 2006 level
with  no  increase  and  puts  at  risk  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  and  priority
Earth  and  space  science  missions.  Certainly  at  risk  is  the  timely  development  of  a
new, much more capable U.S. human spacecraft to follow the Shuttle which will be
retired in 2010.
AGENCY BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS
National Science Foundation (NSF):

Funds  are  requested  to  increase  the  budget  for  NSF  to  $6.43  billion  in  FY  2008,
45  percent  above  2001’s  $4.43  billion  level.  Similar  investments  in  the  past  have
yielded  important  scientific  discoveries,  which  boost  economic  growth  and  enhance
Americans’ quality of life.

The  centerpiece  of  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  is  President  Bush’s
plan to double investment over a 10-year period in key federal agencies that support
basic research programs emphasizing the physical sciences and engineering. NSF is
one  of  the  three  key  agencies,  as  it  is  the  primary  source  of  support  for  university
and  academic  research  in  the  physical  sciences,  funding  potentially  transformative
basic  research  in  areas  such  as  nanotechnology,  advanced  networking  and  informa-
tion technology, physics, chemistry, material sciences, mathematics and engineering.
NSF  has  central  roles  in  two  previously  mentioned  Administration  priority  re-

Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)  and  the  Networking  and  Information  Technology
R&D  program  (NITRD).  NSF-funded  nanotechnology  research,  proposed  at  $390
million  in  FY  2008,  a  five  percent  increase  over  the  2007  request  and  160  percent
since 2001, has advanced our understanding of materials at the molecular level and
has  provided  insights  into  how  innovative  mechanisms  and  tools  can  be  built  atom
by  atom.  This  emerging  field  holds  promise  for  a  broad  range  of  developing  tech-
nologies,  including  higher-performance  materials,  more  efficient  manufacturing
processes,  higher-capacity  computer  storage,  and  microscopic  biomedical  instru-
ments  and  mechanisms.  NSF’s  investments  in  NITRD,  funded  at  $994  million  in
2008,  up  $90  million  over  2007  and  56  percent  since  2001,  support  all  major  areas
of  basic  information  technology  (IT)  research.  NSF  also  incorporates  IT  advances
into  its  scientific  and  engineering  applications,  supports  using  computing  and  net-
working  infrastructure  for  research,  and  contributes  to  IT-related  education  for  sci-
entists, engineers, and the IT workforce.

The  2008  NSF  Education  and  Human  Resources  (EHR)  budget  will  continue  ef-
forts  to  prepare  U.S.  students  for  the  science  and  engineering  workforce  with  a  7.5
percent  increase  (+$53  million)  over  the  level  in  the  House-passed  2007  full-year
CR,  adjusted  for  the  movement  of  EPSCoR  to  the  Research  and  Related  Activities
account. To further strengthen NSF’s emphasis on increasing the quality and quan-
tity of the science and engineering workforce and ensuring that undergraduate stu-
dents  are  well  prepared  for  an  increasingly  technological  global  society,  EHR  will
increase  funding  for  its  undergraduate  education  portfolio  by  $13.4  million.  This
total includes $3.5 million for the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement
program and $5.1 million for the Advanced Technological Education program to im-
prove technician training at community colleges. The FY 2008 EHR budget also pro-
vides an increase of $8.9 million for the Graduate Research Fellowship program, an
amount that will support an additional 200 graduate students, and $4.53 million for
the  Centers  of  Research  Excellence  in  Science  and  Technology,  a  program  designed
to broaden participation in the science and engineering workforce. NSF’s K–12 edu-
cation programs remain strong with $30 million made available in FY 2008 for new
awards under the Math and Science Partnerships program.
Department of Energy (DOE):

DOE  implements  the  President’s  Advanced  Energy  Initiative  (AEI),  highlighted

above. The 2008 AEI Budget proposes:

tovoltaic materials;

electric and ‘‘plug-in’’ hybrid vehicles;

• $217 million for the solar R&D to accelerate development of cost-effective pho-
• $292 million for the biomass R&D, including $179 million for the Biofuels Ini-
tiative  and  an  additional  $113  million  in  supporting  basic  research,  to  help
enable cellulosic ethanol to become practical and competitive;
• $42  million  for  development  of  high-energy,  high-power  batteries  for  hybrid-
• $309 million for the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative to accelerate development of hy-
drogen  production,  storage,  and  infrastructure  technologies  that  can  help
make  possible  the  use  of  hydrogen-powered  fuel  cell  vehicles  and  infrastruc-
ture to support them;
• $40 million for wind energy research to help improve the efficiency and lower
the  costs  of  wind  technologies  for  use  in  low-speed  wind  environments,  and
to help overcome technical and regulatory barriers to more wide-scale deploy-
ment of wind technologies; and
• $108  million  for  the  FutureGen  Initiative  to  develop  technologies  for  a  coal

gasification plant with near-zero atmospheric emissions.

The  2008  AEI  budget  also  proposes  $395  million  for  the  Global  Nuclear  Energy
Partnership  in  Nuclear  Energy  with  the  goals  to  demonstrate  advanced  fuel  cycle
technologies,  to  expand  the  domestic  use  of  nuclear  power,  and  to  provide  for  safe,
environmentally  responsible  global  nuclear  energy  systems  that  support  non-pro-
liferation  objectives.  Full  funding  of  $160  million  for  the  U.S.  contribution  to  the
ITER international fusion energy project is included as well.

The Office of Science in DOE (DOE–SC) is one of the three priority research agen-
cies  in  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative,  supporting  scientific
studies  and  infrastructure  for  a  wide  range  of  basic  research  related  to  potentially
significant  innovations.  The  2008  Budget  provides  $4.4  billion  for  DOE–SC,  an  in-
crease  of  16  percent  over  the  level  in  the  2007  House-passed  full-year  continuing
resolution  (CR),  which  is  $306  million  below  the  President’s  2007  ACI  request.  The
Budget  includes  funding  for  priorities  such  as  nanotechnology  ($286  million),  mate-
rials  science  research  facilities  ($699  million),  basic  research  in  support  of  the  hy-

25

drogen  fuel  initiative  ($60  million),  the  advanced  energy  initiative  ($713  million),
and high-end computing facilities and research ($340 million). The Budget also com-
pletes funding ($45 million) for project and engineering design of the National Syn-
chrotron Light Source II, a new x-ray light source that will enable the study of ma-
terials  properties  and  functions  at  a  level  of  detail  and  precision  (nanoscale)  never
before  possible.  It  continues  support  for  construction  of  the  Linac  Coherent  Light
Source—a  materials  research  facility  that  will  provide  laser-like  x-rays  allowing  an
unprecedented real-time glimpse of chemical and biological processes, fully funds op-
erations for the five nanoscale science research centers, and provides funding for the
project and engineering design for the upgrade of the Continuous Electron Beam Ac-
celerator Facility.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):

The  Department  of  Commerce’s  NIST  ‘‘core’’  research  and  facilities  receive  $594
million  in  2008,  an  increase  of  21  percent  from  the  level  in  the  2007  House-passed
full-year CR, which is $44 million below the President’s 2007 ACI request. In 2008,
the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  proposes  NIST  funding  increases  of  $69
million  for  new  initiatives  in  research  and  measurements  in  high-leverage  areas
such  as  the  Disaster-Resilient  Structures  and  Communities  Program,  the  inter-
agency Climate Change Science Program, and the interagency National Earthquake
Hazards  Reduction  Program.  Support  continues  for  high-leverage,  broad  impact  re-
search  in  quantum  information  processing,  nanotechnology,  and  new  and  expanded
capabilities at the NIST Center for Neutron Research and at its Boulder, Colorado,
high-performance labs.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA):

The President’s 2008 Budget for NASA is $17.3 billion, a 3.1 percent increase over
the President’s 2007 request, reflecting a strong commitment by the Administration
to the continued pursuit of the Vision for Space Exploration. The 2007 House-passed
full-year  CR,  however,  reduces  the  2007  Budget  by  $545  million  to  $16.2  billion.  If
NASA is not provided its 2007 request level of $16.8 billion, the agency needs flexi-
bility within its appropriation accounts to reduce the adverse consequences of a top-
line reduction.

In 2008, NASA requests $3.92 billion for exploration systems including the Orion
Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and the Ares I launch vehicle that will carry astro-
nauts  to  the  Moon.  Having  already  initiated  the  acquisition  process  for  certain  ele-
ments  of  this  architecture  during  2006,  NASA  anticipates  that  all  Orion  CEV  and
Ares  I  elements  will  be  under  contract  by  the  end  of  2007,  with  the  first  crewed-
flight planned to occur no later than 2014.

The  2008  Budget  requests  $5.52  billion,  almost  a  third  of  NASA’s  total  budget,
to  continue  operating  the  59  spacecraft  of  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  and
to  support  investments  in  future  Earth  and  space  science  missions,  vital  tech-
nologies, and frontier research. NASA will develop seven new Earth-observing space
missions,  including  the  Landsat  Data  Continuity  Mission  and  the  Global  Precipita-
tion  Measurement  mission,  which  will  launch  no  later  than  2013.  NASA  will  con-
tinue  its  roles  in  the  interagency  Climate  Change  Science  Program  and  the  inter-
national  initiative  on  the  Global  Earth  Observing  System  of  Systems.  NASA  will
also support studies of the Earth-Sun system using data from the STEREO mission
and the upcoming Solar Dynamics Observatory. A new Lunar Science Research pro-
gram  will  leverage  robotic  investigations  of  the  lunar  surface  in  support  of  the  Vi-
sion  for  Space  Exploration.  Following  up  its  missions  to  Mars  and  Saturn,  NASA
is sending ever-more capable spacecraft to Mars, Mercury, the asteroids, and Pluto.
NASA  also  will  continue  its  vibrant  astronomy  program  through  its  Great  Observ-
atories,  and  will  upgrade  Hubble  in  2008  to  provide  five  more  years  of  productive
on-orbit  life,  while  planning  new  spacecraft,  such  as  Webb  and  Kepler,  that  will
search  for  planets  around  other  stars  and  peer  deep  into  the  universe.  Funding  for
the Beyond Einstein program is increased in FY 2008 to act on the forthcoming rec-
ommendation  from  the  National  Research  Council  regarding  a  strategy  to  unlock
the secrets of the fundamental physics of the universe.

In December 2006, the President approved the Nation’s first National Aeronautics
R&D  Policy.  Consistent  with  this  Policy,  the  2008  NASA  aeronautics  budget
prioritizes  fundamental  aeronautics  research,  the  improvement  of  aviation  safety,
and  research  that  will  help  support  the  development  of  the  Next  Generation  Air
Transportation System. In addition, NASA will address infrastructure upgrades and
maintenance  requirements  for  aeronautical  test  facilities  across  NASA  centers  that
are  of  vital  importance  to  the  Nation.  The  2008  Budget  requests  $554  million  for
NASA  aeronautics,  an  almost  five  percent  increase  over  the  2007  request  after  ad-
justing for NASA’s implementation of simplified full-cost accounting.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA):

For  NOAA  in  the  Department  of  Commerce,  the  FY  2008  Budget  provides  $358
million  for  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Research  (OAR),  a  $20  million  increase  over
the  2007  Budget.  OAR  provides  for  ongoing  research  on  climate,  weather,  air  qual-
ity, and ocean processes.

The  2008  NOAA  budget  supports  a  new  interagency  oceans  initiative  to  imple-
ment  the  President’s  U.S.  Ocean  Action  Plan  including  $60  million  in  new  funding
over the 2007 Budget to advance oceans science and research (of which $13 million
is  in  OAR).  $20  million  will  address  four  near-term  ocean  research  priorities  estab-
lished  by  the  Ocean  Research  Priorities  Plan  and  Implementation  Strategy
(ORPPIS),  published  in  January  (with  another  $20  million  from  NSF  and  USGS).
The  NOAA  Budget  also  proposes  $8  million  to  develop  an  operational  ocean  moni-
toring network, for technology and other infrastructure to support ocean science, for
International  Polar  Year  activities,  and  for  research  on  protected  species  and  com-
mercial fisheries.
United States Geological Survey (USGS):

The  President  has  proposed  a  budget  of  $975.0  million  for  USGS  in  the  Depart-
ment of the Interior in Fiscal Year 2008. The proposed budget includes an increase
of  $3  million  for  the  new  oceans  initiative  activities,  including  $1.5  million  in  the
Coastal  and  Marine  Geology  program  to  begin  implementation  of  the  Oceans  Re-
search Priorities Plan and Implementation Strategy. This involves conducting obser-
vations, research, and sea-floor mapping and developing forecast models. The budget
also  includes  $1.5  million  in  the  Hydrologic  Networks  and  Analysis  program  to
begin  implementation  of  an  interagency  National  Water  Quality  Monitoring  Net-
work  that  will  integrate  watershed,  coastal  waters,  and  ocean  monitoring  based  on
common criteria.

The  FY  2008  USGS  budget  continues  funding  for  operations  and  maintenance  of
Landsats  5  and  7.  The  Budget  also  funds  efforts  with  NASA  and  the  Landsat
Science Team to continue development of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission. The
FY 2008 budget includes $24 million for Landsat 8.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):

The  FY  2008  Budget  for  science  and  technology  funding  at  EPA  is  $755  million.
Research  priorities  include  supporting  the  agency’s  risk  assessment  programs  in-
cluding  Air  Quality  Science  Assessments  (formerly  called  the  Air  Quality  Criteria
Documents) and the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), and the Science to
Achieve  Results  (STAR)  program  of  extramural  research  and  graduate  fellowships
in areas of environmental science and engineering. $69 million is requested to fund
new  and  ongoing  research  in  water  security,  including  monitoring  and  surveillance
of terrorist threat agents, and post-incident decontamination.
Department of Transportation (DOT):

The  FY  2008  Budget  request  for  highway-related  research  is  $430  million,  con-
sistent  with  the  level  in  the  multi-year  surface  transportation  research  authoriza-
tion.  Highway  research  includes  the  Federal  Highway  Administration’s  transpor-
tation research and technology contract programs. These research programs include
the investigation of ways to improve safety, reduce congestion, improve mobility, re-
duce  life  cycle  construction  and  maintenance  costs,  improve  the  durability  and  lon-
gevity of highway pavements and structures, enhance the cost-effectiveness of high-
way infrastructure investments, and minimize negative impacts on the natural and
human environment.

The  2008  Budget  request  for  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  Research,
Engineering, and Development is $140 million, including $63 million focused on the
advancement  of  the  Next  Generation  Air  Transportation  System  led  by  its  Joint
Planning and Development Office.

In addition, the 2008 Budget requests $12 million for the Research and Innovative
Technology  Administration  to  coordinate  and  advance  the  pursuit  of  transportation
research that cuts across all modes of transportation, such as hydrogen fuels, global
positioning  and  remote  sensing.  DOT  research  programs  also  support  the  National
Nanotechnology  Initiative,  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Technology  Program,  and  the
President’s Hydrogen Fuel Initiative.
Department of Defense (DOD):

DOD’s FY 2008 R&D budget is almost $79 billion. This level of funding will sup-
port the Department’s commitment to transform its capabilities and forces for great-
er agility, while enabling effective responses to asymmetric and uncertain challenges
of future conflicts.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

27

These  funds  will  also  help  address  emergent  threats  through  countermeasures  to
biological agents and will advance novel technologies to detect and neutralize impro-
vised explosive devices, mines, rockets and mortars. DOD provides the largest share
of NITRD program funding, over $1 billion, to address IT needs for the Nation’s de-
fense.  Likewise,  DOD  invests  $375  million  under  the  National  Nanotechnology  Ini-
tiative, emphasizing development of materials, devices and systems that address the
national security mission.

The Science and Technology (S&T) component of the overall DOD R&D budget in-
cludes basic research (6.1), applied research (6.2), and advanced technology develop-
ment (6.3). At $10.8 billion in the FY 2008 Budget, DOD S&T exceeds the 2001 en-
acted  level  by  21  percent,  or  $1.8  billion.  From  2000  to  2007,  Congressional  adds
to  DOD  S&T  quadrupled.  For  2007,  there  were  over  1200  of  these  adds  (totaling
$2.8  billion),  most  of  which  must  be  identified  and  tracked  down,  advertised  in  a
way specific to the Congressional mark, evaluated, negotiated and awarded, in some
way  separate  from  other  potential  awards.  This  means  that  those  awards  consume
several  times  the  staff  and  management  resources  of  the  average  research  award,
and may not even target a military-specific research need. The large number of such
additions  creates  impediments  to  the  creation  of  effective  research  programs
throughout  the  Department,  and  should  be  cause  for  concern  to  Congress  as  well
as to the Administration.

A  total  of  $1.43  billion  is  provided  for  DOD  6.1  basic  research  in  2008.  This  is
a  nominal  increase  over  the  2007  Budget  and  represents  13.3  percent  of  the  DOD
S&T Budget, more than last year’s 12.8 percent share.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS):

The  President’s  FY  2008  request  includes  $799  million  for  the  DHS  Directorate
of Science and Technology and $562 million for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Of-
fice.  R&D  continues  to  play  a  key  role  in  securing  the  Nation  against  the  terrorist
threat.  The  President’s  2008  Budget  maintains  an  aggressive  investment  in  sci-
entific research, technology development, and research infrastructure aimed at con-
tinuing  to  enhance  our  nation’s  security.  Priority  research  areas  include:  $100  mil-
lion in transformational R&D aimed at enhancing our ability to detect, identify, and
attribute  nuclear  and  radiological  materials;  $68  million  for  explosives  counter-
measures  research;  and  $15  million  to  fund  cyber  security  and  information  assur-
ance R&D.
CONCLUSION

Making choices is difficult even when budgets are generous, but tight budgets re-
quire  priorities  to  be  focused,  and  program  management  to  be  strengthened.  This
year’s R&D budget proposal provides robust levels of investment that allow America
to  maintain  its  leadership  position  in  science  and  move  ahead  in  selected  priority
areas.  The  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  and  Advanced  Energy  Initiative
properly  focus  R&D  investments  in  areas  that  will  increase  our  economic  competi-
tiveness,  decrease  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  and  accelerate  development  of
clean energy technologies.

America  currently  spends  one  and  a  half  times  as  much  on  federally-funded  re-
search  and  development  as  Europe,  and  three  times  as  much  as  Japan,  the  next
largest  investor.  Our  scientists  collectively  have  the  best  laboratories  in  the  world,
the most extensive infrastructure supporting research, the greatest opportunities to
pursue  novel  lines  of  investigation,  and  the  most  freedom  to  turn  their  discoveries
into profitable ventures if they are inclined to do so.

We lead not only in science, but also in translating science to economically signifi-

cant products that enhance the quality of life for all people.

This  budget  will  sustain  this  leadership  and  maintain  science  and  technology  ca-
pabilities  that  are  the  envy  of  the  world.  I  ask  that  Congress  fully  fund  the  initia-
tives  advanced  in  the  President’s  proposal.  I  would  be  pleased  to  respond  to  ques-
tions.

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOHN H. MARBURGER, III

John  H.  Marburger,  III,  Science  Adviser  to  the  President  and  Director  of  the  Of-
fice  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy,  was  born  on  Staten  Island,  N.Y.,  grew  up  in
Maryland  near  Washington  D.C.  and  attended  Princeton  University  (B.A.,  Physics
1962) and Stanford University (Ph.D. Applied Physics 1967). Before his appointment
in  the  Executive  Office  of  the  President,  he  served  as  Director  of  Brookhaven  Na-
tional  Laboratory  from  1998,  and  as  the  third  President  of  the  State  University  of
New  York  at  Stony  Brook  (1980–1994).  He  came  to  Long  Island  in  1980  from  the
University  of  Southern  California  where  he  had  been  a  Professor  of  Physics  and

Electrical  Engineering,  serving  as  Physics  Department  Chairman  and  Dean  of  the
College  of  Letters,  Ants  and  Sciences  in  the  1970’s.  In  the  fall  of  1994  he  returned
to  the  faculty,  at  Stony  Brook,  teaching  and  doing  research  in  optical  science  as  a
University Professor. Three years later he became President of Brookhaven Science
Associates,  a  partnership  between  the  university  and  Battelle  Memorial  Institute
that competed for and won the contract to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory.
While at the University of Southern California, Marburger contributed to the rap-
idly growing field of nonlinear optics, a subject created by the invention of the laser
in  1960.  He  developed  theory  for  various  laser  phenomena  and  was  a  co-founder  of
the  University  of  Southern  California’s  Center  for  Laser  Studies.  His  teaching  ac-
tivities included ‘‘Frontiers of Electronics,’’ a series of educational programs on CBS
television.

Marburger’s presidency at Stony Brook coincided with the opening and growth of
University  Hospital  and  the  development  of  the  biological  sciences  as  a  major
strength  of  the  university.  During  the  1980’s  federally  sponsored  scientific  research
at  Stony  Brook  grew  to  exceed  that  of  any  other  public  university  in  the  north-
eastern United States.

During his presidency, Marburger served on numerous boards and committees, in-
cluding chairmanship of the governor’s commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power
facility,  and  chairmanship  of  the  80  campus  ‘‘Universities  Research  Association’’
which  operates  Fermi  National  Accelerator  Laboratory  near  Chicago.  He  served  as
a trustee of Princeton University and many other organizations. He also chaired the
highly successful 1991/92 Long Island United Way campaign.

As a public spirited scientist-administrator, Marburger has served local, State and
Federal governments in a variety of capacities. He is credited with bringing an open,
reasoned approach to contentious issues where science intersects with the needs and
concerns  of  society.  His  strong  leadership  of  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  fol-
lowing a series of environmental and management crises is widely acknowledged to
have  won  back  the  confidence  and  support  of  the  community  while  preserving  the
Laboratory’s record of outstanding science.

DISCUSSION

Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Marburger.
I  hope  you  don’t  think  that  I  am  a  one  trick  pony,  because  I
think  every  time  we  have  talked  in  the  last  year  or  probably  year
and a half, I have gone back to the competitiveness, and the Rising
Above  the  Gathering  Storm  report,  which  Norm  Augustine  will
present to us again next month.

And as you know, the number one recommendation of that report
for improving K–12 science and math education was to improve the
teacher  training,  and  that  report  follows  20  years  of  agreement  by
education  experts  on  the  issue,  and  I  think  every  expert  that  has
come before this committee has said it is teacher training, and not
only  does  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  not
focus on teacher training, it does not even include a specific science
education component.

As  I  have  mentioned  earlier,  approximately  70  percent  of  the
education  component  of  the  President’s  Competitiveness  Initiative
focuses  on  K–8  math  curriculum,  math  curriculum  at  the  Depart-
ment of Education. How does the Administration justify such a dif-
ferent focus, and on what expert advice was this decision made?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  education  really  rests  on
three  important  pillars.  It  rests  on  curriculum,  on  pedagogy,  the
art  of  teaching,  and  on  evaluation,  and  all  of  those  have  to  be  ad-
vanced  in  a  balanced  way  in  order  to  ensure  effectiveness  in  edu-
cation.

At the beginning of his Administration, President Bush launched
the  initiative  that  we  all  know  as  No  Child  Left  Behind,  that  in-
cluded  very  important  components  of  literacy,  science,  and  math

education.  And  when  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative
emerged, and the Gathering Storm report that preceded it, this Ad-
ministration  had  already  embarked  on  major  reforms  in  areas  at
all  levels  of  education  that  feed  into  the  quality  of  science  instruc-
tion and eventual competitiveness of our nation.

It was necessary to craft the American Competitiveness Initiative
to fit into the already substantial investments and plans that were
laid  under  the  No  Child  Left  Behind  initiative,  and  I  believe  that
the  framework  of  the  ACI  in  its  education  initiatives  does  reflect
a  considered  approach  to  the  entire  spectrum  of  needs  of  the  edu-
cation.  You  will  note  that  in  current  budget  requests  that  we  are
discussing in this hearing today, the President has asked for addi-
tional  funding  for  the  education  and  human  resources  component
of the National Science Foundation, it is actually a very healthy in-
crease,  and  maintains  funding  in  the  Math  and  Science  Partner-
ship, which most people agree is an important component of enrich-
ing  math  and  science  education  at  the  lower  grade  levels  that  you
are referring to.

So, by no means has this component been ignored by this Admin-
istration  in  laying  the  plans  for  future  economic  competitiveness.
We  are  proud  of  the  investments  that  we  are  making.  We  agree
with  Gathering  Storm  that  there  is  a  need  here,  and  we  feel  that
this budget addresses that need.

Chairman GORDON. Dr. Marburger, I see that you have attended
the  school  of  rope-a-dope  in  trying  to  move  through  your  five  min-
utes.  You  did  a  good  job  there,  but  it  is  interesting  to  me  how  you
can say ‘‘a balanced approach,’’ when 70 percent of the funds go to
K–8  curriculum.  This  is  really  just  a  backdoor  way  to  try  to  fund
No  Child  Left  Behind,  which  is  fine.  I  think  we  need  to  fund  No
Child  Left  Behind,  but  that  is  different  than  the  competitiveness
issue.

You  mentioned  nothing  about  teacher  training.  Over  50  percent
of the teachers in this country that teach math have neither a cer-
tificate or a major in that degree; 92 percent of the physical science
teachers  have  neither  a  certificate  or  a  major  in  that  area.  You
know, all the experts tell us we have got to help these teachers bet-
ter understand their topics.

You  know,  clearly  this  does  not  address  that,  and  it  is  dis-
appointing.  And  I  guess  it  is  really  sort  of  rubbing  our  nose  in  it
to  talk  about  the  National  Science  Foundation,  when  you  have  cut
by  over  50  percent  their  education  component,  one  that  has  been
working for 50 years. So, that is a concern.

Now, let us move to NASA. There is a lot to talk about in NASA,
but I will try to be very succinct here. I would like to ask you why
NASA has not been included in the American Competitiveness Ini-
tiative. NASA’s basic research and technology activities meet all of
the metrics you established in the ACI for inclusion in the National
Science  Foundation,  DOE  Science  Program,  and  in  this  program.
Can you explain the inconsistency in your treatment of NASA’s re-
search programs?

Dr. MARBURGER. Yes, sir. Be glad to do that.
NASA focuses on discovering new phenomena and understanding
the  phenomena  in  outer  space.  It  does  this  through  various  obser-
vational platforms, and we believe that NASA is funded more com-

mensurately  with  the  challenges  in  that  particular  area  of  science
than the other agencies that were identified for ACI priorities.

Chairman  GORDON.  So,  you  don’t  think  that  research  in  aero-
nautics  and  the  other  scientific  research  of  NASA  is  world  class,
and isn’t also part of their charge?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  No,  absolutely.  It  is  part  of  their  charge,  and
they  do  a  good  job  at  it.  But  frankly,  it  is  funded  better  than  the
physical science in these other agencies that has been underfunded
for a long time, and we need to catch up.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  it  took  a  $300  million  cut,  another  cut
in  aeronautics  research.  How  are  we  going  to  get  this  done?  How
are we going to be competitive with the Europeans, when the Euro-
peans  say  that  our  planes  can’t  land  if  they  are  not  quieter,  or  if
they  are  not  more  fuel  efficient,  or  if  they  are  not  less  polluting,
how are we going to meet that challenge?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  think  it  is  important  to  conduct  research  in
civil aeronautics, and I believe that NASA is attempting to address
the effectiveness of the research in that area with management ac-
tions that improve the performance of civil aeronautics research.

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  let  me  ask  you  just  one  last  question,

Dr. Marburger, and we need to get on.

We  had  a  very  interesting  hearing  from  the  National  Academies

on the Decadal Survey. Have you had a chance to review that?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Yes,  sir.  We  commissioned  that  survey.  We  re-
quire  NASA  and  the  National  Science  Foundation  and,  I  guess,
NOAA to ask the National Academies to conduct the survey.
Chairman GORDON. So, do you agree with their conclusion?
Dr. MARBURGER. I agree with many of their conclusions.
Chairman GORDON. Which ones don’t you agree with?
Dr.  MARBURGER.  The  one  that  I  don’t  agree  with  was  the  rec-
ommendation  that  we  put  instrumentation  that  would  address  ob-
servational  needs  back  on  the  NPOESS  satellite,  which  is  not  pos-
sible.  It  will  be  necessary  for  us  to  craft  another  solution  to  the
very  serious  problems  that  we  recognize  and  that  they  identified.
So———

Chairman  GORDON.  And  if  that  is  your  only  problem  that  you
have with it, let me ask you this. Why doesn’t your five-year budg-
et  plan  for  NASA’s  Earth  science  plan  reflect  the  funding  needed
to  make  the  outyear  investment  recommended  by  the  National
Academies’ Decadal Survey?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  We  believe  that  the  outyear  recommendations
for  observational  instrumentation  do  reflect  a  priority  here.  These
are issues that require long-term planning, and———

Chairman  GORDON.  I  am  sorry,  you  said  reflect  the  priorities.
But—are  you  saying—reflect  the  priorities  of  the  Decadal  Survey,
or reflect some other kind of priority?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  We  believe  that  the  observational  platforms
that  gather  information  required  for  climate  change  science  and
other areas of science———

Chairman GORDON. Weather, NOAA.
Dr. MARBURGER.—are very important, and we are very concerned
about those platforms, and we are prepared to support appropriate
levels of funding to sustain them in the future. My office———

Chairman  GORDON.  But  is  appropriate  level  less  than  what  the

Decadal Survey recommended?

Dr. MARBURGER. It is possible.
Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  it  is  not  just  possible.  I  mean,  it  is  a
fact  that  it  wasn’t  put  in  here,  so  how  do  you  determine  what  is
appropriate? Again, this was a two and a half year study that was
very  comprehensive  and  they  made  one  recommendation,  but  you
don’t think it was appropriate?

Dr. MARBURGER. But sir—the plans to place observational instru-

ments on NPOESS———

17 different missions———

Chairman  GORDON.  Well,  that  was  just  one  part  of  it.  There  are

Dr. MARBURGER. Yes.
Chairman  GORDON.—that  they  were  proposing.  And  you  know,
as  we  all  know,  it  is  (as  Mr.  Rohrabacher  pointed  out  yesterday)
disgusting  to  all  of  us  that  $3  billion  was  wasted  on  NPOESS
which  would  have  covered  this  whole  program.  Now,  that  is  spilt
milk, but———

Dr.  MARBURGER.  We  agree,  and  we  don’t  want  to  throw  more
money  after—on  new  programs  without  understanding  them  thor-
oughly. We are working with all of the relevant agencies to identify
programs———

Chairman  GORDON.  I  don’t  think  it  was  new  programs.  I  think

it was bad management that led to the problem.

Dr. MARBURGER. Highly possible.
Chairman  GORDON.  Yeah.  Well,  you  know,  I—excuse  me.  I  don’t
want  to  be  argumentative,  and  I  have  taken  more  than  the  time
that I should have. Let me yield to Mr. Hall.

Mr.  HALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  yield  you  back  some  of  my
time,  if  it  would  help  me  with  you,  or  help  you  with  Mr.
Marburger. If you would like to have half of it.

Chairman GORDON. Well, I think that Dr. Marburger and I agree
on  99  percent  of  the  occasions.  He  doesn’t  write  the  check,  and  so
it is difficult for him to do all that he would like.

Mr. HALL. Dr. Marburger, you hold a very unique position, over-
seeing the—I guess what most people consider the largest driver of
economic  success  and  progress  in  our  country,  science  and  tech-
nology,  and  Mike  Griffin,  I  have  had  visits  with  Mike  during  this
session  and  toward  the  close  of  last  session.  I  am  sure  our  chair-
man has, because Mike is doing a great job, but the Administration
has  to  acknowledge  that  the  budgets  that  are  being  provided  to
him  are  fostering  additional  delays.  There  is  no  question  about
that.

But  we  are  in  a  dilemma  as  to  how  to  handle  that  situation,  as
to whether to get more realistic now and lessen our expectation, or
as  I  have  heard  the  President  say  a  lot  of  times,  I  know  you  have
to, that we are going to grow our way out of this, and that is very
possible,  because  at  the  beginning  of  this  year,  lost  probably  the
greatest  economic  boon  and  drive  that  this  nation  has  had  in  a
long,  long  time,  and  we  have  the  ability  to  overcome,  and  I  think
the problem of what I have suggested to him is to hold our expecta-
tions,  and  continue  to  expect  our  expectations,  and  not  give  in  on
them at this time.

As  I  mentioned  in  my  opening  statement,  the  funding  levels  for
the exploration mission at NASA, reductions in this area are going
to really push back the development of our next manned space ve-
hicle,  and  leave  us  with  a  lot  longer  time  gap  before  we  can  have
access to outer space. And I would ask that you address the effects
this  gap  may  have,  in  terms  of  our  skilled  workforce,  as  well  our
ability  to  use  the  Space  Station  and  our  obligations  to  our  inter-
national  partners.  Most  of  the  $545  million  shortfall  is  going  to  be
borne by the exploration systems program.

And what steps has the Administration taken in response to this
proposal,  and  the  letters  we  have  written  to  them  suggesting  they
put  the  half  a  billion  back.  Can  you  just  generally,  in  the  short
time I have left, clear that up for me?

And  do  you  agree  with  the  fact  that  we  shouldn’t  yield  on  our
expectations  and  our  projections,  and  our  requests  continue  and
have some hopes that with a half a percent lessening of unemploy-
ment  raises  about  $122  billion  a  year,  and  we  expect  that  to  hap-
pen, and it is happening. And I think there is a possibility that we
can hold the schedule, and what are your suggestions on that?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Sir,  my  main  source  of  information  about  this,
and about future prospects, come from Director Administrator Grif-
fin,  who  I  agree  is  doing  an  excellent  job  there  in  a  very  difficult
situation.

It is true that there will be workforce impacts. I believe that they
will  be  inevitable  in  any  case,  as  we  transition  from  a  Shuttle-
based NASA budget to the next generation of equipment and oper-
ations,  but  I  think  that  that  can  be  accommodated.  It  certainly  is
going  to  be  difficult  for  NASA  to  achieve  what  it  needs  to  achieve,
with the constraints that are emerging in its budget situation, and
I  must  say  that  I  don’t  have  the  answers  to  all  the  questions  that
can be asked there.

I  don’t  believe  that  we  should  retreat  from  our  expectations  of
these  programs.  I  think  that  we  should  try  to  find  a  way  to  make
it  work,  and  I  am  sure  that  working  together  with  Congress  and
with the Administrator, we can find ways to do that.

Certainly,  this  Administration  is  committed  to  living  up  to  its
commitments  to  its  international  partners.  We  are  going  to  com-
plete the Space Station. We are going to get some use out of it, but
we  also  need  to  proceed  with  a  design  and  development  and  con-
struction  and  launch  of  this  next  generation  Crew  Exploration  Ve-
hicle.  Administrator  Griffin  feels  very  passionate  about  this,  and  I
am sure you have heard from him and will hear more in the future.
And I would tend to support his analysis of the situation.

Mr.  HALL.  It  was  a  bold  statement  initially  made  in  fairly  good
times,  and  it  is  more  bold  now  to  hold  onto  it,  but  I  hope  you  will
encourage those with whom you work and you oversee to hold onto
that,  and  not  yield  to  it,  and  lessen  our  expectations,  because  I
think  it  is  very  necessary,  one,  to  keep  the  international  partners
we have, and keep our word with them. A lot of things go on com-
pleting this new bird and getting into a new era.

Thank you. I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Chairman GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Hall.
Dr.  Marburger,  I  think  that  you  will  find  universal  respect  for
Dr.  Griffin  and  his  ability,  but  a  $5  billion  shortfall  is  just  a  little

too  much  even  for  someone  of  his  ability.  There  needs  to  be  more
money in this program.

Our  first  person  here  today  was  Dr.  McNerney.  We  yield  to  you

for five minutes.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Dr.  Marburger

for coming down and meeting with us.

I was reviewing some of the details of the budget here, and I see
that there is a significant increase in the fusion energy sciences al-
lotment.  Is  there  a  particular  reason  that  you  think  that  there
would  be  a  breakthrough  in  the  fusion,  or  a  request  from  other
countries? What is the reasoning behind that increase?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Sir,  if  I  am  not  mistaken,  that  is  associated
with  our  commitment  to  the  International  Fusion  Program,  whose
acronym  is  ITER,  to  which  we  have  made  an  investment.  This  is
universally regarded by the fusion science community as an essen-
tial  next  step  for  the  very  long  path  toward  practical  exploitation
of nuclear fusion for power generation, and this is regarded an ex-
pensive, but necessary investment for our nation to make so we can
participate in whatever technology comes from that program.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Well, where do you expect most of the construc-
tion  to  be  taking  place,  or  most  of  the  research  to  be  taking  place
on that?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  The  project  itself,  the  device  itself  will  be  lo-
cated in France, after an extended negotiation regarding the siting
for this, it ended up in France, but research is taking place around
the  world,  and  the  U.S.  is  a  leader  in  this  field,  and  the  center  of
U.S. research in this field is the Princeton Plasma Physics Labora-
tory,  operated  under  the  ownership  of  the  Department  of  Energy
Office of Science.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Is most of that research the tokamak type tech-

nology, or are we looking at inertial confinement fusion?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  There  is  an  inertial  confinement  component  to
the  research  that  is  sponsored  by  the  Department  of  Energy,  but
the main center at Princeton is tokamak type research, and related
devices.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Okay.  Moving  along,  several  items  here.  The
National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  has  a  significant  cut  com-
pared to the ’07 budget. What is the reasoning behind that cut?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  believe  that  the  budget  numbers  don’t  accu-
rately  reflect  the  revenues  that  are  expected  by  the  laboratory.  As
it turns out, the way these laboratories are funded depends on on-
going  awards  during  the  course  of  the  year,  and  that  laboratory
does not expect to experience the kinds of cuts that you might have
inferred  from  the  budget  numbers.  So,  they  expect  to  receive
awards during the course of the year that will add to the numbers
that are shown in the book.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Okay.  I  am  going  to  reserve  judgment  on  that,

on that particular issue.

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Yeah,  I  would  be  glad  to  answer  in  writing,  to
give  you  a  more  detailed  view  of  that  as  I  understand  it  from  the
Department of Energy, the numbers don’t accurately reflect the ac-
tual resources.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Well,  one  of  the  things  that  didn’t  make  sense
was  it  looked  like  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  the  solar  en-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

ergy  budget,  and  yet,  the  NREL  budget  is  going  down,  so  I  didn’t
see how that can———

Dr. MARBURGER. Yes, it is even possible that some of those funds
that  are  in  the  solar  budget  would  be  transferred  later  out  to  the
laboratories, such as NREL. NREL is a laboratory that profits from
the reallocation of those funds. They don’t have a budget that is ap-
propriated  in  quite  the  same  way  as  other  branches  of  the  govern-
ment.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Okay.  Again,  I  reserve  judgment  on  that  one.

Why the significant cut in geothermal power this year as well?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  am  not  sure  about  that.  I  think  that  one  of
the  reasons  is  that  geothermal  power  is  regarded  as  an  important
ancillary  power  source,  but  not  one  of  the  power  sources  that  is
likely to have a very large share of alternative energy in the future.
So,  there  is  some  scaling  back  there,  and  some  increase  in  some
other areas that are scaled up. We try to respond to proposals from
the Department of Energy, who are the experts in this area.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Okay.  On  to  homeland  security  and  the  science
and  technology.  There  seems  to  be  a  large  bias  toward  the  biologi-
cal and chemical threat, and I guess I understand there is a report
forthcoming on the assessment of the threat versus the risk. Is that
report in the works? Are we going to see that soon?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  I  don’t  know  about  the  status  of  that  report.  I
do know that there is a continuing study of the balance of expendi-
tures  on  different  types  of  threats  to  homeland  security.  There  is
a  relatively  recent  new  director  of  the  science  area  there  in  DHS,
who  is  restructuring  the  units,  and  undoubtedly  will  have  some-
thing to say about this.

The—so,  I  would  be  glad  to  answer—there  are  some  statements
in  my  testimony  about  it,  but  I  would  be  glad  to—I  think  that  the
details  of  that  would  require  a  written  response  to  a  question,  I
would be glad to provide.

Chairman GORDON. The gentleman’s time has expired, but let me
make everybody aware that certainly, any written questions can be
submitted to the witness.

Dr. MARBURGER. Okay. Thank you.
Chairman  GORDON.  And  the  gentleman  from  Georgia  is  recog-

nized for five minutes.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you.  Dr.  Marburger,  thank
you for being with us this morning, and I am almost a new member
to  the  Science  Committee,  having  a  two  year  gap,  but  I  remember
back  in  the  108th  Congress,  we  were  beginning  to  have  hearings,
and  more  and  more  information  about  something  that  sounded
new,  and  that  being  nanotechnology,  and  I  am  particularly  inter-
ested  in  that,  particularly  the  health  aspects  of  it,  as  a  physician,
still am a physician, but not practicing.

And  also,  as  a  graduate  of  Georgia  Tech,  the  Georgia  Institute
of  Technology  in  Atlanta,  and  you  know,  there  is  a  lot  of  research
and  development  going  on  there  at  Georgia  Tech,  and  I  noticed
that  over  maybe  the  last  seven  years,  that  the  amount  of  funding
for  nanotechnology  has,  in  fact,  tripled.  I  believe  the  current
amount  in  the  President’s  budget  proposed  is  almost  $1.5  billion.
I  am  pleased  with  that,  but  I  would  like  for  you  to  particularly  to
address  this  issue  about  the  health  potential  of  nanotechnology,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

35

and I noticed of that increased funding in that budget, a large por-
tion of it, after you get out of the National Science Foundation, the
Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  is,  I  think,  what  $5.7
million,  $28,  almost  $29  million  under  the  National  Science  Foun-
dation.

But  tell  us,  there  is  not  really  a  question,  but  discuss  with  us  a
little bit about what are the health concerns, as we continue to de-
velop  this  technology,  and  I  am  absolutely  convinced  that  it  is
something  that  we  need  to  do,  but  if  you  could  talk  a  little  bit
about health concerns in regarding that.

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Yes,  sir.  The  health  concerns  are  similar  to
health  concerns  about  new  chemicals  or  new  chemical  products
that may escape into the environment and affect drinking water or
the atmosphere or domestic or interior spaces, and the means that
we  have  to  address  those  concerns  are  similar  to  what  we  do  now
for the chemical or bio industries. And through the EPA and—par-
ticularly in establishing standards for industry.

All  of  these  relevant  agencies  participate  in  the  National
Nanotechnology Initiative, and their activities regarding health im-
pacts are monitored. We have conferences and forums and monitor
the  literature,  and  try  to  make  sure  that  there  is  investment  by
those  agencies  in  the  necessary  research.  So,  NIST  and  EPA,  Na-
tional Science Foundation, and National Institutes of Health are all
making investments that are relevant to understanding the health
impacts.

Nanotechnology  does  produce  materials  that  are  unprecedented,
are  new,  and  whose  health  effects  have  to  be  studied.  So,  it  is  im-
portant  to  make  investments  in  this  area.  We  have  been  watching
the investments that the agencies make and they are arising. Prob-
ably  they  are  arising  about  as  fast  as  the  capacity  of  the  research
community to do the work. Many people have called for even more
investments,  and  I  believe  that  more  investments  will  be  forth-
coming  and  the  interest  and  the  capabilities  in  the  research  com-
munity  grow.  We  are  certainly  not,  by  no  means  are  we  opposed
to that. We think it is important.

I  might  add  that  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science
and Technology, of which the President of Georgia Tech is a mem-
ber,  have  a  particular  responsibility  to  provide  oversight  for  the
Nanotechnology Initiative, and they have expressed interest in the
health impacts, and are watching that. I expect that their next re-
port  to  Congress  on  this  initiative  will  include  special  attention  to
the health effects.

Mr.  GINGREY.  Well,  Dr.  Marburger,  I  appreciate  you  giving  a
plug  to  the  President  of  Georgia  Tech,  and  I  want  to  make  sure,
Mr. Chairman, that we know what his name is, Dr. Wayne Clough,
one of my classmates.

So,  thank  you,  Dr.  Marburger,  and  I  will  yield  back  the  balance

of my time, Mr. Chairman.

You  have  raised  a  very,  very  important  point,  and  we  are  going
to have more hearings on this later in the year. What is happening
right now is there are a lot of products, or nanotechnology products

could meet something of the fate that the genetic grains did, in the
sense that the technology got out before the public confidence, and
that  I  think  that  we  have  got  to  make  sure  that  one,  obviously,
that  the  products  are  safe,  but  also,  if  they  are  not  safe,  we  need
to  get  them  off  the  shelf,  but  if  they  are  safe,  we  need  to  have  the
technology, the information, behind us so that the public also feels
this.

I  think  that  we  are  not  up  to  speed  on  that  in  this  country,  and
this  is  something  that  we  are  going  to  work  on.  There  are  some
international  groups  that  are  working  on  that.  This  is  important
technology, but it can all be lost if there is not good faith in it. So,
thank you for raising that, and you will see more of that issue.

Mr. Mitchell from Arizona is recognized for five minutes. Mr. Li-
pinski, the Vice Chair of the Committee, is recognized for five min-
utes.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  thank  you,  Dr.  Marburger,  for  your  testimony  today.  I  wanted
to echo a few things that the Chairman has mentioned. As a former
engineer,  and  as  a  Professor,  I  am  concerned  about  the  lack  of
funding for STEM ed in K–12. I just want to echo what the Chair-
man  said  on  that.  I  think  it  is  critical  for  the  future  and  for  our
future  competitiveness,  I  know  that  we  are  having  problems  with
attracting  and  training  more  engineers,  and  I  think  K–12  edu-
cation is a big part of that.

I would also want to talk a little bit about the Manufacturing Ex-
tension Partnership. Manufacturing is very important in our coun-
try.  Sometimes,  I  think  we  believe  that  it  is  an  industry  that  can
be replaced by other industries, but I think we have to understand
that it is critical. If we cannot manufacture items, we are not going
to  be  able  to  survive,  because  it  is  important  to  have  that  here  in
our  country.  I  have  certainly  seen  a  lot  of  manufacturing  leave
from  my  district,  oftentimes  going  overseas  to  China.  I  think  we
need to do more on that, to help our manufacturers in this country.
And  also,  on  nanotechnology,  I  think,  as  the  Chairman  said,  we
need  to  make  sure  that  we  don’t  have  a  situation  where  nanotech
is  being  used  in  a  lot  of  things  already,  and  people  don’t  know
about it, and when people hear about nanotechnology, they have all
kinds  of  concerns  about  it,  just  because  they  simply  don’t  know,
and  we  haven’t  done  enough  to  let  them  know,  and  convince  them
that  this  is  going  to  be  safe,  and  all  of  the  research  hasn’t  been
done  to  make  sure  it  is  going  to  be  safe,  but  I  think  it  is  critical
for  the 
future.  At  Northwestern  University,  they  have  a
Nanotechnology  Center,  which  I  have  been  to,  and  I  really  think
that  it  is  one  of  the  keys  to  our  future  economic  development  in
this country, being there, it is sometimes called the new Industrial
Revolution. I think nanotechnology may be that.

But  the  one  thing  I  wanted  to  get  into  and  ask  you  a  little  bit
more  about.  The  President  is  proposing  now  a  third  Bioenergy  Re-
search  Center,  through  the  Office  of  Science  at  DOE.  The  state  of
Illinois  is  in  a  great  position  for  this,  I  believe,  because  we  have,
obviously,  a  lot  of  rich  cropland,  and  you  know,  first  rate  univer-
sities,  national  labs,  and  a  lot  of  companies  that  are  interested  in
doing this. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in col-
laboration  with  Argonne  National  Lab,  Northwestern  University,

37

the University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago, and Ar-
cher Daniels Midland, and others have submitted a proposal for the
Bioenergy Research Institute.

I  just  wanted  to  know,  I  want  to  ask  you  a  little  bit  about  what
you are looking at, what is going to be looked at in terms of where
to place these centers. My understanding is there is probably going
to  be  one  on  the  East  Coast,  one  on  the  West  Coast.  Certainly,  I
think  Illinois  would  be  a  great  place  to  put  one  in  the  Midwest.
And  I  just  want  to  know  what  the  timeframe  is,  and  what  exactly
you are going to be looking at for the center?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  These  centers  are  an  initiative  out  of  the  De-
partment of Energy, and we rely on them to make those judgments.
It  is  their  proposal.  They  are  going  to  run  the  process,  and  make
the decisions. Our responsibility is to make sure that they are pay-
ing  attention,  and  have  a  valid  sort  of  an  objective  review  process,
and I would direct you to the Department of Energy for specific re-
sponses to the questions that you are asking.

I  would  agree  that  Illinois  is  an  excellent  center  of  research  in
this  area,  and  as  a  matter  of  fact,  I  note  that  recently,  British  Pe-
troleum  is  funding  a  center  in  California,  of  which  the  University
of Illinois is a component.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Yes.
Dr. MARBURGER. So, they are already in this game, and they are
a major producer of federally funded research in your state. But re-
garding  the  specific  criteria,  and  what  they  are  looking  for,  and
how they will run this competition, I do not have those details, and
that will be done out of the Department of Energy. Dr. Orbach un-
doubtedly  will  be  able  to  address  those—I  will  be  glad  to  respond,
to help get that information for you.

Chairman GORDON. The gentleman’s time has expired, but I had
a conversation with Dr. Orbach about this yesterday. His response
was that by virtue of his charge, that he could not really say where
it is going, because he didn’t know quite yet, that I think all of the
applications  had  to  be  turned  in  in  December,  and  that  they  were
reviewing  those,  and  I  think  in  the  next  two  or  three  weeks,  they
are going to make recommendations for the three locations.

Mr.  LIPINSKI.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  wanted  to  thank  Dr.
Marburger  also  for  mentioning  the  collaboration  between  Univer-
sity  of  Illinois,  University  of  California,  and  BP  on  that  center.  It
is something else that I wanted to mention there. Thank you.
Chairman GORDON. Mr. Akin is recognized for five minutes.
Mr. AKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Marburger,  one  of  the  things  that  I  run  into,  I  am  on  the
Armed  Services  Committee,  as  well.  We  work  with  a  lot  of  small
defense contractors in the St. Louis area, and there has been a fair-
ly consistent pattern as I have had a chance to visit them, and ask
them  about  what  their  concerns  and  priorities  are,  with  the  lack
of being able to find engineers. They said about the only engineers
there  are,  is  you  have  got  to  go  to  China  or  India  or  something  to
get one, and that we are not producing enough.

Now, this is something that they used to do in Harvard Business
School  for  case  studies,  they  say  don’t  tell  me  the  second  or  the
third  most  important  thing  you  do.  If  you  had  to  pick  one  thing
that  the  Federal  Government  might  do  that  would  influence  this,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

38

what  would  be  the  single  biggest  thing  that  you  would  suggest?
(And  you  don’t  have  to  buy  the  premise,  either.)  If  you  think  the
Federal  Government  shouldn’t  be  involved,  I  am  inclined  to  think
that way, too, on many things. So whatever you think.

Dr. MARBURGER. Well, let me just mention one big thing that we
strongly support, and that is the Department of Defense’s National
Defense  Education  Program,  which  is  scheduled  for  a  big  increase
in  this  budget.  You  may  recall  that  in  my  generation,  when  I  was
going  to  college,  the  National  Defense  Education  Act  made  it  pos-
sible for a lot of young people like myself to go into science and en-
gineering  fields,  and  we  expect  that  that  same  phenomenon  will
happen.  This  is  something  that  strongly  affects  the  Department  of
Defense.  They  have  a  need  for  U.S.  citizens  to  be  engineers,  and
they  are  willing  to  fund  these  programs,  and  as  the  request———
Mr. AKIN. What exactly—the programs just encourage kids to get

into science, or are they more scholarships programs?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  They  are  more  like  scholarship  programs,  as  I
understand  it.  But  there  is  also  a  very  strong  correlation  between
sponsored  work  in  engineering  and  physical  science  areas  and  the
degrees  granted,  so  I  regard  the  ACI  itself  as  providing  a  major
stimulus  for  the  production  of  engineers  that  does  respond  to  this
widely recognized need for increased engineering production.

Mr.  AKIN.  Just  along  the  same  lines,  one  of  the  things  that  my
kids were involved with a year or two back was a robotics competi-
tions.  I  mean,  I  am  an  engineer,  but  it  might  not  be  the  best  way
to  get  engineers.  My  engineering  came  from  a  horrible  experience
with Latin in eighth grade, and I decided that engineering was the
one  place  you  didn’t  have  to  learn  a  foreign  language,  so  that  is
why I went there, and I didn’t know anything about calculus at the
time, that it was worse than a foreign language.

But anyway, I guess, if I had to pick something, one of the things
that  kids  really  like  is  gee  whiz  sort  of  displays  and  exhibits  and
things,  and  I  am  just  wondering  do  we  have  anything  like  the  ro-
botics,  where  kids  get  that  hands-on.  They  don’t  sit  in  a  boring
classroom,  but  they  get  to  learn  by  doing  stuff.  Do  we  have  a  way
to sort of open the doors of all of the different really incredible sci-
entific things that are going on for kids?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Most  agencies  that  fund  science  or  science  cen-
ters, or have federal laboratories also have ancillary education pro-
grams,  little  museums  or  teacher  training  centers,  or  hands-on  ex-
periences.  And  all  of  these  sort  of  educational  experiences  are  cur-
rently  being  reviewed  under  the  auspices  of  the  Department  of
Education  and  the  relevant  agencies.  There  is  a  committee,  I  can’t
remember,  its  ACC  committee,  that  is  currently  evaluating  those
programs,  and  trying  to  make  sure  that  they  are  as  effective  as
they can be. And we hope that this process of assessment will also
lead to the sharing of best practices.

But there is a very large number of hands-on programs that are
funded  by  agencies  like  the  Department  of  Energy  or  NASA,  you
are probably familiar with some of the———

Mr. AKIN. Well, one other quick question. One of the things that
happened in secondary education was that we changed the way we
did testing, and we did it so we could fudge. We love to fudge num-
bers.  Americans  love  to  fudge  on  the  rules,  and  what  we  do  is  we

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

39

change  the  basis  of  the  tests  every  year,  so  we  don’t  really  have
any  benchmark  as  to  how  well  we  are  doing  or  not  well  we  are
doing.

My  sense  is  that  secondary  education  is  falling  very,  very  short
in  maths  and  sciences.  At  least  even  seven  years  ago,  when  I  was
a State rep, the heads of the universities all came and cried about
the quality of the students they were getting out of secondary edu-
cation  in  the  State  of  Missouri.  I  assume  that  may  be  a  national
pattern. Any thought on that subject?

Dr. MARBURGER. Yes. The ACI does have specific components ad-
dressing the improvement of teaching of science, particularly at the
secondary  level,  and  there  is  an  Adjunct  Teachers  Corps  proposed,
and  programs  to  prepare  teachers  to  teach  advanced  placement
subjects, as an example.

Mr. AKIN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  GORDON.  Yes,  sir.  Again,  Mr.  Akin,  I  don’t  want  to
take  too  much  time.  You  raised  some  very  good  points.  This  com-
mittee  is  going  to  address  that  with—and  I  don’t  guess  you  were
here last year, when Norm Augustine reported on his Rising Above
the  Gathering  Storm.  They  have  laid  out  a  blueprint  for  us,  and  I
think we are really going to take an initiative there.

Unfortunately,  a  lot  of  those  gee  whiz  programs  within  the  Ad-
ministration are being cut back at this time, which is unfortunate,
but  there  is  some  good  news.  The  Department  of  Energy,  within
their Science Office, is starting a program where they are going to
bring in science teachers to the various labs. They will come in for
the  summer,  have  a  program  there,  and  then,  the  next  year,  they
will  bring  their  students  into  the  lab.  I  think  it  is  really  going  to
help  to  inspire  those,  because  most  every  scientist  who  has  come
before this committee has said the reason they got into science was
the  inspiration  of  a  teacher.  Some  of  the  time  it  was  a  gee  whiz,
but mostly, it was a teacher. If we don’t do anything else this year,
we need to get that done, and I hope that we will all work together
to accomplish it.

Dr. Baird is recognized for five minutes.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Dr.  Marburger,  thank  you  for  being  here  today,  and
taking so much of your time. I am going to give you two questions,
and you can parse out your answer accordingly.

First of all, I am interested in whether it is your belief that NSF
should  maintain  its  predominant  role,  in  terms  of  the  science  edu-
cation  side,  or  should  that  be  shifted  over  to  the  Department  of
Education?  And  I  will  share  my  bias.  It  is  just  an  evidence-based
belief,  a  judgment,  that  NSF  actually  has  a  strong  tradition,  and
is certainly the preferred source. I have spoken to many, many edu-
cational  institutions,  and  they  would  not  like  to  see  the  NSF  edu-
cation  mission  shifted  over  to  the  Department  of  Education.  So,  I
will put that out, and would welcome your response.

The second part is, is it your belief that the NSF should continue
its  responsibility  for  the  icebreaking  mission  up  north,  given  that
basically,  it  is  essentially  a  pass-through  to  the  Coast  Guard?
Should  not  the  responsibility  shifted  directly  over  to  the  Coast
Guard,  to  let  NSF  focus  its  resources  and  management  on  more
core missions, and possibly have more flexibility regarding its data
collection in the Arctic region, other than just icebreaking?

40

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Congressman,  I  do  believe  that  the  National
Science  Foundation  has  a  very  important  role  education.  That  is
part  of  its  charter,  and  indeed,  I  think  it  must  continue  to  deliver
outstanding  research  and  models  and  ideas  that  can  be  promul-
gated throughout our educational establishment at all levels.

Education is a very big issue here. It is a very large phenomenon
in  society,  and  there  is  a  lot  to  do,  and  there  are  different  types
of  things  that  need  to  be  done.  We  do  have  a  Department  of  Edu-
cation  that  has  a  major  role  to  play  in  the  development  of  best
practices  in  the  classrooms  throughout  the  country.  And  I  believe
that  the  Department  of  Education  and  the  National  Science  Foun-
dation  have  to  work  together  to  deliver  the  parts  of  the  needs  to
address, the needs that are relevant to their specific missions.

And  I  think  it  is  necessary  to  try  to  figure  out  who  should  be
doing  what,  and  if  the  Department  of  Education  doesn’t  have  the
necessary strength or quality controls, then we need to make it bet-
ter,  and  I  know  that  the  Secretary  of  Education  is  determined  to
improve  the  performance  of  the  Department  of  Education  in  these
areas.  Educational  research  that  is  appropriate  to  the  Department
of Education has improved in this Administration, and indeed, cer-
tain types of fundings to improve it have been supported repeatedly
in our budgets.

But  it  is  also  true  that  the  National  Science  Foundation  does
have a good track record, in educational research and in programs
for training teachers, and we think that they should continue to do
that in their appropriate domain, but I do not think that it should
all  be  done  out  of  the  National  Science  Foundation,  and  I  don’t
think it should all be done out of the Department of Education. But
we need to work together on this to make sure who should be doing
what.

So,  let  me  answer  the  icebreaker  question  briefly.  It  will  be  nec-
essary  for  this  nation  to  maintain  its  capacity  for  icebreaking  and
for access to the poles for many reasons. And it is essential for the
National Science Foundation to have access to icebreaking capabili-
ties. Now, from my perspective, I don’t care how they get it particu-
larly.  I  think  that  the  main  concern  is  to  spend  the  money  wisely,
and if that means giving it to the National Science Foundation, and
having  them  procure  the  service,  then  so  be  it.  If  it  means  giving
the  money  to  the  Coast  Guard,  and  having  them  do  it,  and  then
provide  the  service,  then  so  be  it.  But  I  think,  from  the  highest
level perspective, it is ‘‘money is money.’’ If we can save money and
have more of it for science, then I would go with that.

So, we sponsor interagency discussion on this, and we have been
working  the  issue,  and  trying  to  foster  a  path  for  it.  I  know  it  is
currently  under  intense  scrutiny,  but  the  report  from  that  group
that is working it hasn’t been delivered yet. It is under review. And
I  will  support  whatever  the  interagency  agreement  is  on  it.  I  can’t
say how it will come out.

Mr.  BAIRD.  Thank  you,  Doctor.  I  share  the  premise.  I  don’t  nec-
essarily  have  a  dog  in  the  fight.  I  just  think  if  we  can  spend  the
money more efficiently, and let NSF focus on its core mission, while
still having access to the poles, that makes a lot of sense.

I yield back.

Chairman  GORDON.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Baird.  You  know,  I  have  to
say I agree with Mr. Marburger that there should be some balance,
but the fact of the matter is that the National Science Foundation’s
50-year successful program, has been cut by 50 percent, just in the
last few years. That is not balance.

Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Chairman, if I may.
Chairman GORDON. Certainly.
Mr.  BAIRD.  Mr.  Marburger,  I  appreciate  the  notion  that  Depart-
ment  of  Education  has  to  work  with  NSF  on  this,  but  I  just  want
to underscore that in the last few weeks I have met with probably
30  or  40  provosts  and  research  directors  from  some  of  the  leading
institutions  in  this  country,  colleges  and  universities.  They  are  al-
most  unanimous  that  NSF  should  be  the  focus  of  teacher  training
in the area of sciences, and that is where the mission should come
from. And they also, actually, advocate increasing collaboration and
cooperation  between  the  discipline-focused  sciences  and  the  edu-
cation  side,  but  they  think  the  origin  and  aegis  of  that  should  be
NSF, not Department of Education.

Thank you.
Chairman  GORDON.  We  hear  it  over  and  over,  before  this  com-

mittee and at home, over and over.

My friend from California is recognized for five minutes.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Were you referring to me?
Chairman GORDON. It depends on what your question is.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Let  me,  before  I  ask  my  question,  just  note,
Dr. Marburger, since we are talking about education, and this was
driven  home  to  me  yesterday.  I  am  trying  to  expand  nursing  pro-
grams  at  our  junior  colleges  in  my  district,  and  in  our  area.  And
well,  and  the  reason  why  it  is  so  difficult  for  our  junior  colleges  to
do that is that the unions of the professors of these various colleges
are  saying  no,  you  cannot  pay  someone  who  is  teaching  nursing
and  medical  type  of  courses  more  money  than  you  pay  someone
who  is  teaching  English  literature  or  history;  and  thus  when  we
have  this  dramatic  shortage  of  nurses,  we  are  unable  to  establish
programs that will result in more nurses for our society. And there
are  wonderful  jobs  that  are  available  for  people  with  nursing  de-
grees and teaching, and very few jobs that are available for people
with  English  literature  degrees.  Just  yesterday,  I  was  trying  to
meet with the educators from my area on that issue, and the same
is true with science education and mathematics in high school and
junior high school.

If we could just break through this hold that unions have on ‘‘ev-
erybody  else  should  be  paid  exactly  the  same,  whether  you  teach
basket-weaving  or  physics,’’  we  would  have  better  teachers  going
into  these  fields,  and  it  wouldn’t  cost  a  lot  of  money.  That  is  just
one  thing  that  I  am  just  throwing  out,  so  when  you  are  discussing
this  with  other  people,  maybe  we  should  focus  on  that,  to  try  to
change the structure that we have, so that we can recruit teachers
and  pay  them  more  money,  in  order  to  get  higher  quality  people,
without  having  to  pay  basket-weaving  teachers  or  physical  edu-
cation  teachers  more.  I  am  an  athlete  and  I  appreciate  that,  but
a  fifth  grade  physical  education  teacher  should  not  be  getting—we
should  not  be  neglecting  a  mathematics  or  science  teacher  at  that
level,  who  will  get  a  better  job  elsewhere,  because  we  can’t  pay

them  more  money,  in  order  to  pay  the  phys  ed  teacher,  or  the  guy
who watches the kids when they are on recess.

So, anyway, that is a thought. I was noticing in the budget sum-
mary  here  that  biomass  is  only  receiving  a  $15.8  million  expendi-
ture,  and  yet,  the  President  has  mentioned  switchgrass  and  bio-
mass a number of times, and people who I talk to suggest that bio-
mass  has  a  tremendous  potential,  and  in  fact,  I  notice  then  you
have  got  $160  million  for  fusion  energy  research,  and  let  me  just
note  there—the  studying  that  I  have  done  on  fusion  shows  that
there  has  been,  over  the  years,  billions  of  dollars  spent,  and  I  am
going  to  see  some  people  in  my  office  just  this  week  on  this  issue,
and I have yet to identify really significant progress that has been
able  to  be  implemented  to  show  any  difference  in  our  way  of  life,
as compared to the potential of biomass.

So,  are  we  not  loading  down  the  establishment,  which  you  have
so  many  people  who  pay  their  salaries  of  their  scientists  at  their
universities, but not really having so much to show after ten years,
versus  biomass  that  has  a  tremendous  potential  that  could  be  put
to use very quickly, even with the President’s own words?

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Certainly,  biomass  is  a  very  important  option
for energy for the future, and this Administration does support bio-
mass research and development.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. But only $15 million worth.
Dr. MARBURGER. Well, my notes indicate that in the Department

of Energy, there is $292 million for biomass R&D.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay.
Dr. MARBURGER. And we can discuss exactly where the numbers
come  from,  but  we  have  got  here  $179  million  for  the  Biofuels  Ini-
tiative.  There  is  an  additional  $113  million  in  supporting  basic  re-
search  to  (and  this  is  directly  related  to  the  cellulosic  issue,  which
we really need to have breakthroughs in).

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I see.
Dr. MARBURGER.—if we are going to make this. So———
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay.
Dr. MARBURGER. So, we have a disagreement———
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, thank you.
Dr. MARBURGER.—about the numbers that———
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay. I am just———
Dr. MARBURGER.—we can straighten out.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.—reading  the  figures,  then,  and  I  appreciate

you———

Dr. MARBURGER. It is easy to do, Congressman.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Yeah.  I  appreciate  you  clarifying  this.  And
one fundamental question, if I may. You know, we had this hearing
here yesterday with the decadal report, which was very impressive,
and I was impressed by the fact that they offered practical sugges-
tions, rather than just, you know, shovel more dollars in our direc-
tion, which is far too often what people are suggesting. Shovel more
dollars,  and  we  are  going  to  have  more  progress.  They  actually
made  some  very  tangible  recommendations,  and  they  made  some
observations  about  the  minimum  necessary  to  do  this  and  that,  to
accomplish  very  admirable  goals,  and  not  just  some,  ‘‘well,  we  are
going to prove global warming,’’ but instead, ‘‘we are going to deter-
mine how we are going to affect people’s lives,’’ et cetera. But here

we  have  $500  million,  which  they  claim  they  need  to  spend  more,
and  I  mentioned  that  we  had  this,  of  course,  $3  billion  overrun
with NPOESS, which was very disheartening.

But  along  with  NPOESS,  we  have  to  recognize  there  is  a  war
going  on  in  Iraq,  and  today  I  am  supporting  the  President’s  surge
request,  and  I  have  had  to  do  a  lot  of  praying  about  this,  and  a
lot of thought about this, because we are talking about, Mr. Chair-
man,  we  are  talking  about  billions  and  billions  of  dollars  every
month,  and  here,  for  the  Decadal  Report,  that  was  just  asking  for
$500 million a year.

Is  this  Iraq  situation  really  having  a  major  impact  on  science  in

our country?

Dr. MARBURGER. I am not sure that is a scientific question. Con-
gressman, I try to work within the realm of the possibility and the
practical.  What  I  can  say  is  that  the  United  States  is  spending  an
enormous amount of money on research. We far outspend any other
country,  and  all  of  Europe  on  our  research  budget,  and  so  there  is
a lot of money on the table, and it is not just a question of dollars.
Actually, Chairman Gordon has made this point, there is a ques-
tion  of  priorities,  and  we  have  to  negotiate  and  discuss  what  the
priorities are, and try to come up with something that we can agree
to  fund.  And  I  think  we  will  do  that.  But  it  is  not  just  a  question
of  money.  We  have  got  to  spend  this  money  wisely.  As  science  be-
comes  more  expensive,  and  there  is  more  and  more  demand  for
whatever  funding  we  put  on  the  table,  I  think  we  owe  it  to  the
American  people  to  do  the  best  job  we  can  at  identifying  what  is
the  most  important  thing,  what  is  the  most  important,  way  to
spend the money, and that is what I am dealing with.

So,  I  would  say  that  science  is  doing  very  well  in  this  country,
but  we  need  to  keep  our  eye  on  the  ball,  and  make  these  adjust-
ments as we go along to make sure we are spending it in the right
place.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, thank you very much. I won’t push you

any further on that question.

Chairman GORDON. The gentleman’s time has expired. I will say
that,  I  guess  the  good  news  and  bad  news  is  that  yes,  the  country
is spending a lot of money on science. However, as a percent of our
GDP,  it  is  continuing  to  go  down,  and  it  is  lower  than  many  other
countries.

But  to  the  Administration’s  defense,  bioresearch,  mass  research,
has been a priority. And I think that hopefully, we are going to see
some  breakthroughs  there,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  new  en-
zymes. Five minutes to Dr. Ehlers.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Gordon,  and  welcome  back,  Dr.
Marburger. I am pleased to see you here, and I hope you will soon
be fully recovered.

As  you  know,  I  have  been  very  active  on  STEM  education,
science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  education.  We  formed
the STEM caucus. We have over 100 members of Congress as mem-
bers, and the Senate has decided it is such a good idea, they start-
ed their own. So, it is no surprise that I will be asking about some
issues relating to STEM education.

First of all, just for starters, how, if at all, is the work of the Aca-
demic  Competitiveness  Council  reflected  in  the  Fiscal  Year  ’08

budget  request  for  STEM  education?  And  as  you  know,  they  were
appointed  to  advise  the  Administration  on  many  of  these  issues.
And  I  am  not  sure  they  have  fully  reported  yet,  but  has  their
report———

Dr.  MARBURGER.  Yeah,  very  briefly.  The  work  of  that  committee
was  going  on  more  or  less  in  parallel  with  the  preparation  of  the
budget,  so  it  did  not  have  an  opportunity  to  have  a  major  impact
on it, but I don’t doubt that it will in the future.

Mr.  EHLERS.  I  appreciate  that,  and  I  hope  that  it  will  have  a
major  impact  on  the  budget.  Another  issue  is  regarding  the  Na-
tional  Science  Foundation  educational  programs,  and  you  know,  I
don’t hold you responsible for this, because I know who was respon-
sible  for  the  past  decisions,  in  which  money  was  basically  taken
away  from  the  National  Science  Foundation  education  effort  and
moved over to the Department of Education. And I have absolutely
no  problem  with  the  Department  of  Education,  after  many  years
without  much  interest  in  this,  finally  showing  an  interest,  and  I
appreciate  Secretary  Spellings’  very  hard  work  on  it,  and  her  very
strong feelings about doing it.

That is not the point. The problem is, as I told her, why take the
money  away  from  NSF?  They  are  the  ones  who  have  been  doing
it  for  50  years,  and  have  done  an  outstanding  job.  They  were  the
ones  who  will  be  doing  it  50  years  from  now,  whereas  the  Depart-
ment  of  Education  changes  much  more  rapidly,  and  with  a  new
President coming in, we may not have a math science effort in the
Department of Education.

I appreciate what you have been able to do with the NSF’s budg-
et, but I wanted to emphasize, and I hope you will agree with this,
that  this  a  major  issue.  The  NSF  has  done  great  work  on  it.  The
interesting thing is they also do the groundbreaking work, and the
best  evaluative  work  of  anyone  in  the  business,  in  this  country  or
other countries. And I hope you can join with us in making the en-
tire  Administration  aware  of  this,  and  help  us  in  our  efforts  to  in-
crease funding, for that part of NSF, as well as the other increases
they have received.

I would appreciate your comments on that.
Dr.  MARBURGER.  Well,  I  think  this  year’s  budget  request  by  the
President for the National Science Foundation should be good news
for  those  who  value  the  education  component  of  NSF.  It  does  re-
spond  to  favorable  reviews  of  the  quality  of  the  work  that  NSF
does,  particularly  in  the  areas  that  you  mentioned,  Congressman.
So, in that respect, some of the work that was done in connection
with  the  ACC  exercise  did  affect  thinking  about  the  value  of  that
work  and  the  quality  of  it  in  NSF,  and  so,  this  year’s  budget  does
reflect  increases  for  the  education  and  human  resources  section  of
the National Science Foundation. I expect that will continue.

Mr. EHLERS. I hope it is not a one year blip, but in fact, an indi-
cation  of  a  changed  policy,  and  that  the  ACC  report  coming  up,  I
think it is in April you get the report. I would hope that next year’s
would show an even greater increase.

So,  one  last  question.  Yesterday,  we  had  a  hearing  in  this  very
committee  on  the  Earth  Science  Decadal  Survey,  and  all  of  the
Committee  Members  who  were  present  here  recommended  that
OSTP  should  develop  and  implement  a  plan  for  sustaining  global

Earth  observation,  and  a  single  point  of  contact  or  program  office
at the cabinet level should be established to assure complementary
efforts for all operational aspects of Earth observation and analysis.
And  those  are  precisely  their  words,  and  they  all  stood  by  those
words.

Do you see something of this sort happening? The general feeling
is that Earth science, as looked at from outer space, has decreased.
The  past  few  years,  there  has  been  less  emphasis.  Will  we  be  able
to turn that around, and get back to where we were?

Dr. MARBURGER. Earth observation is one of those areas that af-
fects  a  lot  of  agencies,  and  it  is  certainly  ripe  for  an  interagency
coordination  activity.  There  are  precedents  for  national  coordi-
nating  offices.  We  have  them  for  the  National  Nanotechnology  Ini-
tiative,  and  for  the  Networking  and  Information  Technology  R&D
Initiative,  both  of  which  are  congressionally  mandated  operations,
so  there  is  a  precedent  for  that.  I  believe  that  those  two  national
initiatives are working well under that structure that Congress has
promulgated.  So,  it  certainly  would  not  be  out  of  the  question  to
have something like that occur.

Mr. EHLERS. Well, everyone on this committee (I believe, I think
I  can  speak  for  everyone)  was  impressed  by  the  results  that  we
heard  yesterday,  and  would  certainly  welcome  an  administrative
initiative on this.

Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman GORDON. I thank you, Dr. Ehlers.
Dr. Marburger, I did not put Dr. Ehlers up to any of those ques-
tions. I think it demonstrates, once again, there is a bipartisan in-
terest  in  the  Augustine  recommendations,  and  again,  I  don’t  mean
to be argumentative, and if I am wrong, I stand corrected, but your
office  and  the  President  had  those  recommendations  long  before
this budget came up.

You know, those recommendations were ignored. They are not re-
flective  of  this  budget.  Again,  I  won’t  go  over  the  statistics  once
again, but for Dr. Ehlers’ interest, the education aspect of K–12 in
National  Science  Foundation  has  been  reduced  by  50  percent  over
the  last  three  or  four  years.  We  do  have  great  bipartisan  interest
in this.

Again,  I  know  you  are  a  spear-carrier,  but  we  are  going  to  have
to get together, and see if we can’t work this out. This is important,
on a bipartisan basis for this committee. You have heard it, again,
without any kind of orchestration. I won’t belabor that, but I thank
you  for  your  presence  today,  for  dealing  with  the  variety  of  issues
that were before you, to still get here.

And I excuse the witness and adjourn this committee.
Dr. MARBURGER. Thank you.
[Whereupon, at 11:36 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by John H. Marburger, III, Director, Office of Science and Technology Pol-

icy

Questions submitted by Chairman Bart Gordon

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Q1. The  FY08  NIST  budget  request  looks  like  a  case  of  robbing  Peter  to  pay  Paul.
For  example,  the  cut  to  MEP  and  elimination  of  the  ATP  just  about  offset  the
increase  for  lab  funding  and  construction.  It  seems  that  rather  than  requesting
any new funding for NIST, you are just rearranging the deck chairs. Could you
tell us the specific criteria that are used for determining the NIST budget alloca-
tions and priorities?

A1. The President’s budget request for NIST prioritizes the core research operations
which are likely to have long-term payoffs significantly greater than the short-term
impacts  of  ATP  and  MEP.  Such  long-term  impacts  are  the  primary  objective  of  the
American  Competitiveness  Initiative.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  NIST  budget  has
been  earmarked  in  the  past  at  levels  much  greater  than  the  President’s  requested
increase.
Q2. Since 2001, we have lost 2.9 million manufacturing jobs and last year alone we
lost  another  110,000  manufacturing  jobs.  These  jobs  are  high-skill,  high-wage
jobs  that  on  average  pay  23  percent  more  than  the  national  average.  It  is  these
types of high-wage jobs which are the backbone of communities across the coun-
try.
NIST just released an impact assessment of the MEP program. In the 2005 sur-
vey of only 30 percent of MEP clients, they reported:
• $6.3 billion in increased/retained sales;
• $2.2 billion in modernization investment; and
• 53,000 jobs created or retained.
These  documented  results  represent  only  a  small  portion  of  the  MEP’s  total  im-
pact. And, the results come from a federal investment of only $104 million. What
other federal programs to support manufacturers show a similar documented re-
turn on investment? Given the MEP’s success rate and that small- and medium-
sized manufacturers are struggling in the face of global competition, what is the
justification for cutting the MEP budget by more than 50 percent?

A2. NIST meets the Nation’s highest priorities by focusing on high-impact research
and  investing  in  the  capacity  and  capability  of  NIST’s  user  facilities  and  labs.  This
emphasis  is  validated  by  the  high  rate  of  return  to  the  Nation  that  the  NIST  labs
already have demonstrated. Nineteen retrospective studies of economic impact show
that, on average, NIST labs generated a benefit-to-cost ratio of 44:1 to the U.S. econ-
omy. The high rate of return results from the fact that new measurements or stand-
ards  benefit  entire  industries  or  sectors  of  the  economy—as  opposed  to  individual
companies.

The  President’s  request  will  ensure  that  funding  goes  to  vital  basic  research  to
strengthen  the  Nation’s  innovation  enterprise  vital  to  manufacturing—especially  in
the areas of physical sciences, engineering, computing, and nanotechnology—instead
of subsidizing research and consulting services that should be funded by private in-
dustry.  Creating  an  innovation  environment  by  supporting  basic  research  has  the
highest payoff for all of society, including industry. Basic research results which can
be used by a variety of researchers in academia and industry are much more impor-
tant to economic development than are subsidies, through the Manufacturing Exten-
sion  Partnership  (MEP)  program,  that  benefit  particular  firms  and  their  share-
holders.

MEP  Centers  provide  manufacturing  firms  with  consulting  services  that  are  also
available through private entities. Given the benefits reported by MEP clients, it is
reasonable  to  have  these  clients  share  a  larger  proportion  of  the  cost  of  these  serv-
ices.  The  FY  2008  Budget  request  would  maintain  a  network  of  MEP  centers  that
are  funded  according  to  their  performance  and  need,  and  would  encourage  these
Centers  to  be  more  efficient  by  reducing  their  overhead  costs,  including  high  mar-
keting  costs.  As  first  created  in  1988,  the  MEP  program  anticipated  that  centers
should  become  self-sufficient  after  six  years  of  federal  funding,  which  has  not  hap-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

49

pened.  Centers  could  also  ask  MEP  clients  to  cover  more  of  the  cost  of  the  services
through modestly increased fees.
Q3. In  FY  2003,  the  Administration  requested  $13  million  for  the  MEP,  in  FY
2004—$13  million,  in  FY  2005—$39  million,  in  FY  2006—$47  million,  in  FY
2007,  $46  million  and  in  FY  2008  $46  million.  Each  year,  the  Administration
provides a different and vague justification for cutting the program: it’s not nec-
essary,  the  private  sector  can  perform  all  the  tasks,  other  federal  agencies  will
make up the funding shortfall, or that federal funding was not supposed to last
beyond  six  years  and  this  year  that  approximately  20  percent  of  MEP  clients
have  more  than  250  employees  and  therefore  they  can  charge  more  for  services
and federal funding can be reduced.
Will  you  provide  us  the  analysis  that  you  have  done  to  justify  these  claims  and
how  the  centers  will  absorb  the  proposed  reduction.  In  addition,  discussion  of
business size is a new issue. The Small Business Administration categorizes any
business  of  less  than  500  as  small.  Is  the  Administration  seeking  to  redefine
what qualifies as a small business?

A3. The  cost  savings  and  efficiency  improvements  reported  by  manufacturing  cli-
ents  of  MEP  Centers  result  in  reducing  costs  to  MEP’s  clients  and  could  be  used
to support increased fees for future MEP Center services. The annual reported bene-
fits by manufacturing clients of the MEP Centers conducted through an independent
survey demonstrates a significant level of cost savings and efficiency improvements
for  the  MEP  clients.  For  example,  the  latest  MEP  client  survey  results  (released
January 2007 and reflecting FY 2005 benefits) suggest that MEP helped 16,448 cli-
ents  increase  and  retain  sales  of  nearly  $6.3  billion;  and  generated  cost  savings  of
just  over  $1.3  billion  (both  recurring  and  non-recurring).  These  benefits,  resulting
in  reduced  costs  and  increased  profits  for  the  client,  could  be  used  to  support  in-
creased  fees  for  future  services.  With  increased  revenues  streams  from  client  fees,
MEP centers may offset the reduction in federal funds.

The  data  describing  the  fraction  of  MEP  business  serving  clients  with  more  than
250  employees  was  provided  by  the  MEP  in  their  analysis  of  their  business  (‘‘Mak-
ing  a  Difference  for  America’s  Manufacturers’’),  and  was  not  a  delineation  chosen
by the Administration.
Q4. Approximately $104 million is required to maintain a fully operational network
of  MEP  Centers.  What  will  be  the  impact  of  the  Administration’s  proposed  56
percent  cut  on  the  current  network  of  Centers  and  the  level  of  services  that  they
provide?
Could  you  please  provide  us  with  the  impact  assessment  that  has  been  done  by
the  Department  of  Commerce?  The  FY  2008  budget  request  indicates  that  with
the $46 million for MEP, only a subset of Centers will be operational. What will
this  smaller  system  look  like—will  there  be  an  emphasis  on  regional  centers  or
will some states simply lose MEP coverage?

A4. The  MEP  Director  will  work  with  the  centers  to  develop  options  that  consider
each  center’s  customer  base,  constraints,  and  opportunities.  Actions  taken  by  any
center or group of centers will be assessed against their ability to maintain support
to the small manufacturers. MEP will work with the centers to examine alternatives
and optimize the best plan for operating at the $46.3 million level that ensures the
maximum benefit to small manufacturers.
Q5. The  Administration  has  justified  the  elimination  of  the  Advanced  Technology
Program (ATP) because of a growth of venture capital funds and other financial
services for high risk technology, yet this committee has heard repeatedly during
the  past  five  years  that  venture  capital  funds  for  high-risk  technology  develop-
ment are scarce. Could you provide us with the documentation that supports the
Administration’s claims?

A5. The  Administration  believes  that  other  investments  in  cutting  edge  basic  re-
search,  the  tools  of  science  and  the  next  generation  of  scientists  are  the  best  way
to lay the groundwork for continued leadership in innovation, exploration and inge-
nuity. Since the ‘‘dot-corn bubble’’ burst, venture financing has resumed growth. Ac-
cording  to  Dow  Jones  venture  capital  data,  venture  capital  activity  in  2006  is  at  a
five-year high both in terms of the number of deals (2,454) and the total capital in-
vestment ($25.75 billion). There is no evidence that the distribution of venture cap-
ital funding is not the best response to market demands.
Q6. The Administration has justified abolishing the ATP because it only benefits sin-
gle  companies  and  not  industry  at  large.  The  Administration  claims  that  the

50

American  Competitiveness  Initiative  will  not  impact  individual  companies  but
will  be  broad-based.  The  ATP’s  mandate  is  that  it  can  fund  projects  that  will
only  have  broad  industry  impacts  beyond  a  single  company’s  private  profit.  I’ll
cite  just  a  few  examples  of  broad  impact  ATP  projects:  the  two  millimeter
projects  which  helped  the  entire  U.S.  auto  industry,  the  Affymetrix  DNA
diagnostics project, and the Integrated Circuit projects. In addition, the Admin-
istration  funds  many  industry  lead  tech  programs  at  the  DOE.  Why  doesn’t  the
ATP  fit  within  the  scope  of  the  Administration’s  policies  and  current  activities?
A6. The  ACI  is  about  prioritization  within  limited  resources.  While  the  ATP  pro-
gram has had some successes, reviews by the GAO found that ‘‘it is not evident that
ATP  funding  was  actually  needed  for  individual  projects  to  achieve  these  results.’’
For  example,  the  two-millimeter  project  involved  the  Big  3  automobile  companies.
It  is  hard  to  see  how  several  million  federal  dollars  would  enable  Big  3  Auto  to  do
something  that  they  could  otherwise  not  afford  to  do  or  that  would  not  otherwise
get done. Additionally, a survey of ATP clients indicated that 75 percent would have
continued  their  project  would  have  continued  in  some  form  without  ATP  funding.
For  these  reasons,  the  ATP  program  simply  cannot  compete  with  NIST’s  Nobel-
Prize-winning basic and applied research as a federal priority.

National Science Foundation
Q7. The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)
is  $1.45  billion,  which  is  roughly  four  percent  above  the  FY  2007  funding  esti-
mate. As you are aware, there have been many calls from academia and indus-
try  for  a  more  robust  and  more  tightly  focused  research  effort  on  the  environ-
mental,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  aspects  of  nanotechnology.  The  funding  allo-
cated  for  EHS  research  under  the  NNI  program  has  been  about  three  percent
of  the  total  program,  and  some  outside  groups  have  claimed  this  is  an  overly
optimistic  estimate.  How  does  the  FY  2008  budget  for  the  NNI  reflect  these  re-
peated calls for significant growth of funding for research in this area?

A7. NNI  participating  agencies  are  committed  to  supporting  EHS  aspects  of
nanotechnology,  and  their  allocations  to  these  programs  has  been  increasing  to
match the flow of qualified proposals in this area.

The amount of funding that is going to programs whose primary purpose is to un-
derstand  and  address  potential  risks  to  health  and  to  the  environment  posed  by
nanotechnology  is  up  55  percent  over  2006  actual  expenditures  and  up  28  percent
over the 2007 request. [Estimates for FY 2007 spending in this area based on appro-
priations are not yet available.] These estimates do not include substantial research
on  instrumentation  and  metrology  and  on  fundamental  biological  interactions  upon
exposure to nanomaterials, both of which will be important in the performance and
interpretation  of  toxicological  research.  In  addition,  research  to  determine  toxicity
is a lengthy process; increased spending cannot shorten the time it takes to do cer-
tain types of toxicological studies.

The  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implications  (NEHI)  Working
Group,  the  interagency  group  that  coordinates  EHS  research  under  the  NNI,  is  in
the  process  of  prioritizing  the  EHS  research  needs  based  on  the  report  released  in
September 2006 entitled Environmental, Health, and Safety Research Needs for En-
gineered  Nanoscale  Materials.  The  NEHI  Working  Group  reports  are  developed  by
consensus,  however  final  budget  allocations  are  made  by  the  individual  agencies  in
the context of their respective missions and requirements.
Q8. Funding  for  the  National  Information  Technology  Research  and  Development
(NITRD)  program  is  held  flat  in  the  FY  2008  request.  Although  the  NSF  fund-
ing  contribution  for  NITRD  grows  by  $90  million,  or  10  percent,  the  NIH  con-
tribution  drops  by  $78  million,  or  14  percent.  Given  the  value  of  information
technology to advancing medical research and improving the efficiency and low-
ering the cost of health care delivery, what is the rationale for this drop in NIH
funding for the principal federal R&D effort in information technology?

A8. For the past several years, the NITRD budget estimates for NIH have exceeded
actual  expenditures  after  appropriations.  For  example,  NIH’s  budget  estimate  for
NITRD for 2006 as reported in the 2007 Budget Supplement was $500.6M, whereas
the  actual  expenditures  on  projects  that  competed  successfully  were  $432M.  Simi-
larly, the NIH budget request estimate for 2007 was $490.7M, whereas after receiv-
ing the final FY 2007 appropriations level, the estimate was revised to $426M. The
actual  expenditures  will  be  determined  by  the  number  of  projects  that  successfully
compete in FY 2007.

Department of Energy
Q9. The Administration appears to place low priority on energy efficiency programs.
(The  Federal  Energy  Management  Program,  Industrial  Technologies,  and
Weatherization Assistance are all slated for cuts in the FY 2008 budget request.)
Given the effectiveness of energy efficiency at reducing greenhouse gas emissions
and reducing consumer costs, why are these programs getting short shrift?

A9. The reduction in Weatherization Assistance enables DOE to spend more on pri-
ority  programs  in  the  President’s  Advanced  Energy  Initiative,  such  as  solar  energy
and  biofuels.  Even  so,  DOE  plans  to  weatherize  more  than  54,000  homes  with  FY
2008 funding. The FY 2008 request for Industrial Technologies ($46M) and the Fed-
eral Energy Management Program ($17M) are essentially the same as the FY 2007
request in those areas.
Q10. A  report  released  in  January  by  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology
found that geothermal energy could supply a substantial portion of the United
States’ future electricity requirements with minimal environmental impact and
probably at competitive prices. Given the promise of this often overlooked tech-
nology,  why  is  the  Administration  trying  to  completely  cut  all  R&D  in  this
area?

A10. Over  30  years  of  federal  funding  in  this  area  has  contributed  to  successful
commercialization of improved geothermal technologies. Therefore, policy efforts are
now focused on encouraging industry to build new geothermal plants. For example,
EPACT  2005  enacted  several  incentives  for  geothermal  power,  including  attractive
lease royalties, streamlined leasing procedures, and a 1.5 cents/kWh production tax
credit.  Largely  as  a  result  of  these  incentives,  there  are  currently  58  geothermal
construction projects underway in nine states, representing 2,250 MW of new gener-
ating capacity (compared to 2,800 MW of existing U.S. geothermal capacity).
Q11. The budget requests close to $200 million to invest in vehicle technologies, par-
ticularly plug-in hybrid technologies. At the recent Detroit Auto Show, GM an-
nounced their plans to produce a plug-in hybrid by 2010. Could you talk about
the process of commercializing DOE energy research? Could you talk about how
DOE  research  is  intersects  with  R&D  that  is  occurring  in  the  private  sector,
what is being done to avoid duplication of effort, and how DOE advancements
will make it into the commercial market quickly and smoothly?

A11. The  DOE  FreedomCAR  and  Fuel  Partnership,  with  cost-shared  funding
through  the  DOE  Vehicle  Technologies  program,  is  a  government-industry  partner-
ship  that  conducts  technology  roadmapping  and  prioritization  of  jointly  funded  re-
search and development activities in this area.

This  collaboration  seeks  to  minimize  duplication  of  effort  and  accelerate  commer-
cialization  of  advanced  vehicle  technologies.  Industry  partners  include  BP  America,
Chevron  Corporation,  ConocoPhillips,  Exxon  Mobil  Corporation,  Shell  Hydrogen
LLC,  and  the  United  States  Council  for  Automotive  Research  (USCAR)—a  legal
partnership  among  DaimlerChrysler  Corporation,  Ford  Motor  Company,  and  Gen-
eral  Motors  Corporation.  The  key  technology  hurdle  for  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles  is
advanced energy storage, which receives $42M in the FY 2008 request, an $11M in-
crease (+35 percent) over the FY 2007 request.
Q12. According  to  the  Energy  Information  Administration,  hydropower  currently
provides seven percent of U.S. electricity supply, yet the Administration has re-
quested  zero  R&D  funds  for  this  technology.  Are  advances  in  hydropower  effi-
ciency and even small-scale hydropower not worth investigation?

A12. Market barriers to private sector investment in hydropower R&D are minimal.
Therefore, consistent with R&D Investment Criteria on the necessity of market bar-
riers  to  justify  federal  investment,  the  decision  has  been  made  to  close  out  the  Hy-
dropower Program.
Q13. Why  has  funding  for  R&D  in  Electricity  Delivery  and  Reliability  been  cut  10
percent  (from  $95  million  to  $85  million)  when  there  is  significant  work  to  be
done in modernizing and securing the Nation’s electricity grid?

A13. The decrease in funding reflects a refocusing of the High Temperature Super-
conductivity (HTS) activity. In FY 2008, the program will not focus on development
of  HTS  motors  and  generators,  an  activity  initiated  prior  to  FY  2006.  Instead,  the
program  will  primarily  support  the  development  and  commercialization  of  super-
conducting  cable  systems  and  wires,  which  could  improve  the  capacity  of  electricity
transmission and distribution in urban areas.

Q14. The  President  is  proposing  to  develop  three  Bioenergy  Research  Centers
through  the  Office  of  Science  at  DOE—up  from  two  proposed  in  the  original
plan.  What  technical  or  scientific  areas  will  the  third  research  center  inves-
tigate that are not being addressed by the other two?

A14. The  third  Bioenergy  Research  Center  will  increase  the  overall  research  capa-
bility of the DOE Genomes-To-Life (GTL) program to address barriers to commercial
feasibility  of  key  energy  technologies.  In  its  2006  review  of  the  GTL  program,  the
National  Academies  recommended  that  GTL  facilities  focus  not  on  particular  tech-
nologies,  but  on  fundamental  research  that  underpins  bioenergy  technologies.  Con-
sistent  with  this  recommendation,  each  of  the  three  Bioenergy  Research  Centers
will have long- and intermediate-term visions in bioenergy research, with sufficient
flexibility  to  allow  adjustments  in  research  directions  in  response  to  promising  de-
velopments. These Centers are envisioned to serve as catalysts for bioenergy-related
research supported by the broader GTL program.
Q15. Despite the Administration’s enthusiasm for the project, the Global Nuclear En-
ergy Project has received an unenthusiastic reception in Congress. As you know,
there  are  major  concerns  about  whether  the  project  will  prove  to  be  worth  the
enormous  costs  forecast  for  the  coming  years.  What  can  you  tell  us  today  to
allay  these  concerns  and  convince  us  that  the  project  warrants  a  400  percent
increase  in  funding  over  FY  2006  levels,  and  even  greater  increases  in  years
to come?

A15. The  Budget  provides  $395  million  for  GNEP  R&D  and  related  activities,  in-
cluding  design  work  on  engineering-  and  commercial-scale  facilities,  economic  anal-
ysis,  and  alternative  business  plans  needed  for  a  Secretarial  decision  by  June  2008
on  the  future  direction  of  the  program.  Funding  for  GNEP  is  for  essential  research
and design activities. No funds are provided for procurement of equipment, facilities
or construction activities on any reprocessing, advanced burner reactor, or fuel cycle
facility.
Q16. The FY 2008 budget request once again proposes to eliminate R&D in Oil and
Gas,  and  even  goes  as  far  as  asking  Congress  to  repeal  a  provision  in  EPACT
2005  in  this  area.  Contrary  to  the  assertion  that  these  were  handouts  to  the
super-major oil companies, these programs actually focused on developing tech-
nologies for difficult-to-reach deposits on shore and in the ultra-deep waters of
the Gulf of Mexico, and to some extent for companies that otherwise cannot af-
ford such expensive R&D. At a time of record high prices for both oil and gas,
and widespread concern about our over-reliance on foreign energy, does it make
sense  to  slash  programs  that  increase  supply,  allow  smaller  independent  pro-
ducers  to  compete  in  a  market  with  the  super-majors,  and  ultimately  drive
down costs of these fuels?

A16. Oil and gas are mature industries and both have every incentive, particularly
at  today’s  prices,  to  enhance  production  and  continue  research  and  development  of
technologies on their own. Oil companies, along with the oil services industry, have
shown  remarkable  engineering  prowess,  including  when  it  comes  to  offshore  engi-
neering.  There  is  no  need  for  taxpayers  to  subsidize  oil  companies  in  these  efforts.
The  Administration’s  Research  and  Development  Investment  Criteria  direct  pro-
grams  to  avoid  duplicating  research  in  areas  that  are  receiving  funding  from  the
private  sector,  especially  for  evolutionary  advances  and  incremental  improvements.
The  2008  Budget  proposes  to  expand  access  to  oil  and  gas  resources,  streamline
permitting  processes,  and  make  the  R&D  investment  tax  credit  permanent.  These
changes  will  leverage  private  sector  ingenuity  and  are  preferred  ways  to  increase
domestic  production  of  oil  and  gas  rather  than  federally  funded  R&D.  The  Depart-
ment  expects  the  service  industry  to  continue  to  provide  technological  innovations
for use by major and independent producers.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Q17. The  National  Weather  Service  (NWS)  received  a  substantial  increase  in  the
President’s  FY  2008  request  including  an  expansion  of  the  Tsunami  Warning
Network ($17.2 million). How will this increase in funding translate into faster
and more accurate warnings for tsunami’s worldwide?

A17. Note:  The  increase  in  NOAA/NWS  funding  for  Strengthening  the  U.S.  Tsu-
nami Warning and Mitigation Program is $1.7M, not $17.2M as stated in the ques-
tion.

The total funding for the NOAA/NWS tsunami program for FY08 is $23.2M. This
$23.2M fully funds the extended warning operations of two Tsunami Warning Cen-

ters  (Pacific  Tsunami  Warning  Center,  Ewa  Beach,  HI  and  the  West  Coast/Alaska
Tsunami  Warning  Center,  Palmer  AK)  into  round-the-clock,  fully  staffed  centers
serving  the  Pacific  and  Arctic  Ocean  regions,  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  Caribbean  Sea,
and  Gulf  of  Mexico,  as  well  as  interim  warning  information  for  the  Indian  Ocean.
NOAA  is  also  working  to  facilitate  robust  tsunami  detection  including  deployment,
operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  39  DART  buoy  station  network.  Of  these  39
DART  stations,  32  are  sited  throughout  the  Pacific  Rim—which  historically  is  the
most active seismic source for tsunamis. These 32 DART stations will provide timely
and  effective  tsunami  detection  for  just  about  all  countries  that  border  the  Pacific
Rim.  In  addition,  of  the  seven  DART  stations  to  be  sited  throughout  the  Atlantic-
Caribbean Sea-Gulf of Mexico, five DARTs will provide accurate and timely tsunami
warnings  of  a  tsunami  generated  in  the  S.  Atlantic/Caribbean  Sea.  Upgrades  of
eight seismic stations and 33 Tsunami-ready sea level stations, as well as the addi-
tion of 16 new sea level stations, enhance and modernize the existing system to in-
crease coverage and accuracy of forecasts and warnings.

Improvements  in  the  forecast  system  include  advancing  coastal  mapping,  hazard
assessment, and inundation modeling for all vulnerable areas. USGS seismic station
expansion,  especially  in  the  Caribbean,  and  integration  with  other  U.S.  and  global
ocean and coastal observation systems will improve NOAA/NWS ability to more rap-
idly  determine  the  location  and  magnitude  of  seismic  events  that  might  trigger  a
tsunami.  NOAA  is  also  creating  and  leveraging  partnerships  through  the  National
Tsunami  Hazard  Mitigation  Program  to  develop  capacity  for  community-based  haz-
ard  mitigation  to  improve  preparedness  of  at-risk  areas  in  the  U.S.  and  its  terri-
tories. It is an integrated Federal Government program with State, community and
global partners.
Q18. The  budget  request  cuts  nearly  $4  million  in  the  NOAA  budget  for  NASA–
NOAA Partnerships to transition research into operations. The transition of re-
search  missions  of  NASA  into  operational  systems  at  NOAA  is  a  perennial
problem.  Why  were  these  funds  cut?  What  activities  are  eliminated  due  to  this
cut? What is the Administration doing to address this problem?

A18. This item has never been included in the Administration’s budget requests for
NOAA. Congress provided funds for this program through earmarks in FY 2005 and
FY 2006. With regard to FY 2007, under the terms of the year-long continuing reso-
lution,  NOAA  has  indicated  that  it  has  been  able  to  provide  $3.7  million  for  this
effort  under  the  terms  of  the  year-long  continuing  resolution.  However,  this  item
was  not  included  in  the  FY  2008  budget  request  as  NOAA  will  be  continuing  this
work as part of its core operations.

NOAA and NASA have formed a Joint Working Group on Research to Operations
to improve interagency coordination, information-sharing and planning on this topic.
Both agencies have indicated that they are committed to finding effective long-term
solutions  to  the  long-standing  problem  of  financing  the  transition  of  research  data
products  into  operational  data  streams.  OSTP  has  an  interest  in  this  issue  as  well,
and will monitoring these coordination efforts.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. I have serious concerns about cuts to NASA’s aeronautics research and develop-
ment programs, as well as its education programs. Will these programs see fur-
ther  cuts,  while  human  space  exploration  initiatives  will  see  only  modest  in-
creases? How will this affect the local workforce?

A1. NASA  has  made  significant  progress  in  reformulating  its  approach  to  aero-
nautics  research  by  aligning  its  aeronautics  activities  with  the  President’s  recently
issued National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy, with the purpose of
advancing  U.S.  technical  leadership  in  aeronautics.  In  conjunction  with  this  effort,
NASA is collaborating with the broad research community, including industry, aca-
demia, and other government agencies. The FY 2008 budget request for NASA’s aer-
onautics  programs  includes  programmatic  content  increases  in  excess  of  $270  mil-
lion from FY 2008 to FY 2012 relative to the President’s FY 2007 request.

Education is and will continue to be a fundamental element of NASA’s activities,
reflecting a diverse portfolio of pre-college, informal and higher education programs.
The  funding  requested  for  NASA  Education  activities  in  the  FY2008  President’s
Budget  Request  should  be  sufficient  to  maintain  NASA’s  efforts  to  provide  content,
resources and facilities in support of workforce development.

Regarding its workforce, NASA has recently instituted the responsibility of moni-
toring  and  managing  the  workforce  at  an  Agency-level,  rather  than  at  a  pro-
grammatic level, in order to better integrate workforce considerations into early pro-

54

gram and budget planning and to continue identifying the skills the overall Agency
will  require  in  the  future.  It  would  be  premature  to  attempt  to  predict  the  impact
of  funding  decisions  on  a  center-by-center  basis  at  this  juncture.  The  workforce  re-
quired  by  any  program  (including  Aeronautics  and  Education)  will  be  balanced
against  the  workforce  requirements  of  the  agency  as  a  whole,  and  ultimately  re-
flected in the workforce maintained at each center.
Q2. I  am  pleased  to  see  that  fusion  energy  funding  will  be  increased,  especially  the
International  Thermonuclear  Experimental  Reactor  (ITER).  The  U.S.  must  con-
tribute its fair share in international clean energy research and development ac-
tivities.  What  is  the  time  frame  for  fusion  reactors  to  be  used  commercially?  Is
nuclear energy research at a place where we can guarantee safety and minimize
waste?

A2. ITER  will,  if  successful,  move  towards  developing  fusion’s  potential  as  a  com-
mercially  viable,  clean,  long-term  source  of  energy  near  the  middle  of  the  century.
U.S.  nuclear  plants  have  an  outstanding  record  of  safety  and  reliability  through-
out  the  last  15  years,  and  we  will  continue  to  place  safety  as  our  highest  priority
in  future  nuclear  programs.  The  Global  Nuclear  Energy  Partnership  proposes  to
close  the  fuel  cycle  domestically,  as  has  been  done  in  other  countries,  by  recycling
spent nuclear fuel for use in fast reactors, therefore drastically reducing the amount
of high-level radioactive waste to be placed in a permanent geologic repository. The
Department of Energy continues to fund research and development to ensure safety
and reduce the waste associated with nuclear power.
Q3. Regarding  National  Science  Foundation:  I  am  glad  to  see  the  Education  and
Human  Resources  division  is  set  for  increases  greater  than  inflation.  I  am  also
pleased  the  agency  is  investing  in  activities  to  broaden  participation  in  science,
technology,  engineering  and  math.  However,  the  K–12  program  funding  would
see  a  nine  percent  decrease  from  the  FY07  level  and  flat  funding  relative  to  the
President’s  FY07  request.  This  is  a  problem,  and  I’ve  said  many  times  it  is  im-
portant  for  NSF  to  reach  kids  at  a  young  age.  What  programs  will  be  most  af-
fected by the K–12 decrease?

A3. The  National  Science  Foundation  has  several  programs  which  support  K–12
education.  Within  the  Directorate  for  Education  and  Human  Resources,  Discovery
Research  K–12  and  the  Math  and  Science  Partnerships  programs  are  the  Agency’s
primary  programs  aimed  at  improving  K–12  education.  The  President’s  FY  2008
budget  request  includes  $107  million  for  the  Discovery  Research  K–12  program,  a
level equal to the FY 2007 request, but $12.08 million over the FY 2006 actual level.
Given  that  the  FY  2007  Joint  Continuing  Resolution  provides  no  increases  for  the
EHR budget, the FY 2007 funding level for DRK–12 is below the President’s budget
request.  The  President’s  FY  2008  budget  includes  $46  million  for  the  Math  and
Science Partnerships (MSP) Program, which will provide $30 million for new awards
in FY 2008.

Additional  programs  supporting  K–12  education  include  the  Advanced  Techno-
logical  Education  (ATE)  Program,  managed  by  the  Division  of  Undergraduate  Edu-
cation  (DUE),  which  provides  support  to  high  school  students  engaged  in  NSF-sup-
ported technician training programs. Similarly, the National STEM Digital Library,
also  managed  by  DUE,  provides  educational  resources  to  teachers  and  students  at
all  levels  and  in  formal  and  informal  settings.  The  Informal  Science  Education  and
Outreach program, while not exclusively a K–12 program, supports the development
films,  museum  exhibits  and  activities  focused  on  the  needs  and  interests  of  the  en-
tire population, including K–12 students and their teachers. And K–12 education ac-
tivities  are  not  limited  to  programs  managed  by  the  Education  and  Human  Re-
sources  Directorate.  Many  research  grants  funded  through  the  R&RA  budget  also
include K–12 education and outreach activities, including teacher professional devel-
opment  programs.  All  of  these  programs,  and  others,  contribute  to  advancing  K–12
education, which we agree is a high priority.

The FY 2008 request for Informal Science Education is $66 million, level with the
FY  2007  request  but  an  increase  of  $3.35  million  over  the  FY  2006.  And  the  FY
2008  request  for  the  Division  of  Undergraduate  Education  includes  $51.62  million
for  the  ATE  program  and  $16.5  million  for  the  NDSL  program,  increases  over  the
FY  2007  request  of  $5.12  million  and  $500,000,  respectively.  Therefore,  I  believe
that the President’s FY 2008 budget includes significant increases in funding for K–
12  education  through  a  variety  of  programs,  including  MSP,  ATE,  NDSL  and  the
R&RA budget line.

We  look  forward  to  the  results  of  the  Academic  Competitiveness  Council’s  efforts
to  inventory  and  evaluate  the  success  of  current  STEM  education  programs  across
the Federal Government so that in the future, we can focus our investments on pro-

55

grams that are proven effective or that at least have a clear plan for using rigorous
evaluation  to  understand  the  impact  of  educational  activities  and  interventions  on
student learning.
Q4. Finally, the Advanced Technology Program and Manufacturing Extension Part-
nership  are  two  initiatives  at  the  National  Institute  for  Standards  and  Tech-
nology  that  are  important  for  innovation  and  sustaining  small  manufacturers.
Why  does  the  Administration  propose  eliminating  ATP  and  cutting  MEP  by  56
percent, when a bipartisan Congress insists on protecting these programs?

A4. The President’s request will ensure that funding goes to vital basic research to
strengthen  the  Nation’s  innovation  enterprise  vital  to  manufacturing—especially  in
the areas of physical sciences, engineering, computing, and nanotechnology—instead
of subsidizing research and consulting services that should be funded by private in-
dustry.  Creating  an  innovation  environment  by  supporting  basic  research  has  the
highest payoff for all of society, including industry. Basic research results which can
be used by a variety of researchers in academia and industry are much more impor-
tant to economic development than are subsidies, through the Advanced Technology
Program  (ATP)  or  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  (MEP)  program,  that  ben-
efit particular firms and their shareholders. Large shares of ATP funding have gone
to  major  corporations  that  could  well  fund,  and  have  well  benefited  from,  invest-
ments  in  these  technologies.  Past  reviews  by  the  Government  Accountability  Office
have  found  that  ATP-funded  projects  are  often  similar  to  those  conducted  by  firms
not  receiving  such  subsidies.  In  addition,  the  2007  House  Floor  and  Senate  com-
mittee bills would have terminated ATP.

The  2008  Budget  request  provides  $46  million  for  the  Manufacturing  Extension
Partnership  program,  equal  to  the  2007  Budget.  MEP  Centers  provide  manufac-
turing  firms  with  consulting  services  that  are  also  available  through  private  enti-
ties.  Given  the  benefits  reported  by  MEP  clients,  it  is  reasonable  to  have  these  cli-
ents share a larger proportion of the cost of these services. The FY 2008 Budget re-
quest would maintain a network of MEP centers that are funded according to their
performance  and  need,  and  would  encourage  these  Centers  to  be  more  efficient  by
reducing  their  overhead  costs,  including  high  marketing  costs.  Centers  could  also
ask MEP clients to cover more of the cost of the services through modestly increased
fees.

Questions submitted by Representative Daniel Lipinski

Department of Energy
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE):
Q1. Geothermal—A  report  released  in  January  by  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of
Technology  found  that  geothermal  energy  could  supply  a  substantial  portion  of
the  United  States’  future  electricity  requirements  with  minimal  environmental
impact and probably at competitive prices. Given the promise of this often over-
looked  technology,  why  is  the  Administration  trying  to  completely  cut  all  R&D
into its potential?

A1. Please see response to Chairman Gordon’s tenth question.
Q2. Hydrogen—Of all renewable energy technologies, R&D for hydrogen receives the
largest funding allocation in the President’s budget request. This also completes
the  President’s  commitment  to  $1.2  billion  in  hydrogen  funding  over  five  years.
Is it expected that funding for Hydrogen will continue at these levels, or will re-
sources now be directed to other areas of energy research with nearer-term impli-
cations?

A2. While hydrogen technology continues to represent an important area for energy
research and development, decisions about funding levels beyond FY 2008 have not
been determined.
Q3. The  Industrial  Technologies  Program,  which  directly  aids  many  small-  to  me-
dium-sized  businesses  in  the  Chicagoland  area  and  throughout  the  country  in
identifying  technology  areas  in  which  large  potential  for  energy  savings  may  be
realized,  is  facing  the  chopping  block  once  again.  Additionally,  this  budget  pro-
poses  gutting  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory.  How  can  you  justify
these  cuts  when  the  President  cited  technology  as  the  savior  to  breaking  our  oil
addiction in his State of the Union address last year?

A3. To improve operating efficiency, DOE is shifting the management of some sub-
contracted  projects  from  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  (NREL)  to  the
Golden Field Office and the National Energy Technology Lab. This shows up in the
funding line but does not represent a cut in funding for research conducted at NREL
itself.  The  FY  2008  request  for  Industrial  Technologies  ($46M)  is  essentially  the
same as in the FY 2007 request. DOE is focusing additional funding on priority pro-
grams in the Advanced Energy Initiative, such as solar energy and biofuels.

Office of Science:
Q4. The President is proposing to develop three Bioenergy Research Centers through
the  Office  of  Science  at  DOE—up  from  two  proposed  in  the  original  plan.  The
State of Illinois is blessed with not only an abundance of rich cropland yielding
vast acreages of corn and the potential for switchgrass, but also numerous first-
rate  Universities,  Laboratories,  and  Companies  that  are  expanding  our  knowl-
edge  in  the  field  of  alternative  energy.  The  University  of  Illinois  at  Urbana–
Champaign,  in  collaboration  with  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  Northwestern
University,  the  University  of  Chicago,  the  University  of  Illinois  at  Chicago,  Ar-
cher  Daniels  Midland,  and  others  submitted  a  proposal  recently  for  the  Bio-
energy  Research  Institute.  These  institutions  bring  together  the  scientific  exper-
tise and resources needed to develop new energy sources and reduce our reliance
on imported oil. What technical or scientific areas will the third research center
investigate  that  are  not  being  addressed  by  the  other  two?  We  think  that  the
UIUC application is good, and a Center in the Midwest would be really invalu-
able. Can you comment on a timeframe on when a center will be selected?

A4. The  third  Bioenergy  Research  Center  will  increase  the  overall  research  capa-
bility of the DOE Genomes-To-Life (GTL) program to address barriers to commercial
feasibility  of  key  energy  technologies.  In  its  2006  review  of  the  GTL  program,  the
National  Academies  recommended  that  GTL  facilities  focus  not  on  particular  tech-
nologies,  but  on  fundamental  research  that  underpins  bioenergy  technologies.  Con-
sistent  with  this  recommendation,  each  of  the  three  Bioenergy  Research  Centers
will have long- and intermediate-term visions in bioenergy research, with sufficient
flexibility  to  allow  adjustments  in  research  directions  in  response  to  promising  de-
velopments. These Centers are envisioned to serve as catalysts for bioenergy-related
research  supported  by  the  broader  GTL  program.  The  Office  of  Science  will  select
and  initiate  two  Bioenergy  Research  Centers  in  FY  2007  and  will  add  and  support
a third Center in FY 2008.
Q4a. Flat  funding  for  DOE  science  in  recent  years  has  forced  the  Office  of  Science
to  scale  back  the  degree  to  which  it  is  able  to  make  extramural  grant  awards.
Of  course,  because  it  operated  large  user  facilities—certainly  an  important
function  of  the  DOE—it  is  the  core  research  programs  and  extramural  grants
that suffer the most. The reduction in DOE extramural research funding is par-
ticularly  noticed  in  physics  departments  and  certainly  fields  of  engineering  at
our universities. How will the funding increases that are proposed in the Presi-
dent’s  budget  for  the  DOE  Office  of  Science  affect  DOE  ability  to  increase  the
number  of  grants  it  is  able  to  make  to  colleges  and  universities?  How  is  it  ex-
pected to impact DOE grant award success rates?

A4a. In  recent  years,  nearly  50  percent  of  the  Office  of  Science’s  research  funding
has  been  awarded  to  colleges,  universities  and  private  institutes.  In  the  FY  2008
budget, additional funding has been provided for a number of Office of Science pro-
grams that fund extramural research institutions as well as scientific user facilities
and  national  laboratories.  The  exact  allocation  of  these  funds  and  the  grant  award
success rates will depend on the results of competitive solicitations and the research
needs of individual programs.

NIST
Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP)
Q5. Since 2001, we have lost 2.9 million manufacturing jobs and last year alone we
lost  another  110,000  manufacturing  jobs.  These  jobs  are  high-skill,  high-wage
jobs that on average pay 23 percent more than the national average and are the
backbone  of  communities  across  the  country.  Last  year,  the  Administration  an-
nounced  its  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  during  the  State  of  the  Union
address. From my point of view, competitiveness is about job creation and reten-
tion. I would like to give you this opportunity to explain to our constituents and
small manufacturers across the country why the Administration proposed to gut

the  Manufacturing  Extension  Partnership  program  that  has  a  proven  track
record in creating and retaining good jobs and growing the economy.

A5. NIST meets the Nation’s highest priorities by focusing on high impact research
and  investing  in  the  capacity  and  capability  of  MST’s  user  facilities  and  labs.  This
emphasis  is  validated  by  the  high  rate  of  return  to  the  Nation  that  the  NIST  labs
already have demonstrated. Nineteen retrospective studies of economic impact show
that, on average, NIST labs generated a benefit-to-cost ratio of 44:1 to the U.S. econ-
omy.  The  President’s  request  will  ensure  that  funding  goes  to  vital  basic  research
to  strengthen  the  Nation’s  innovation  enterprise  vital  to  manufacturing—especially
in  the  areas  of  physical  sciences,  engineering,  computing,  and  nanotechnology—in-
stead  of  subsidizing  research  and  consulting  services  that  should  be  funded  by  pri-
vate industry. Creating an innovation environment by supporting basic research has
the highest payoff for all of society, including industry. Basic research results which
can  be  used  by  a  variety  of  researchers  in  academia  and  industry  are  much  more
important  to  economic  development  than  are  subsidies,  through  the  Manufacturing
Extension  Partnership  (MEP)  program,  that  benefit  particular  firms  and  their
shareholders.

MEP  Centers  provide  manufacturing  firms  with  consulting  services  that  are  also
available through private entities. Given the benefits reported by MEP clients, it is
reasonable  to  have  these  clients  share  a  larger  proportion  of  the  cost  of  these  serv-
ices.  The  FY  2008  Budget  request  would  maintain  a  network  of  MEP  centers  that
are  funded  according  to  their  performance  and  need,  and  would  encourage  these
Centers  to  be  more  efficient  by  reducing  their  overhead  costs,  including  high  mar-
keting  costs.  Centers  could  also  ask  MEP  clients  to  cover  more  of  the  cost  of  the
services through modestly increased fees.
Q6. The  2005  MEP  Assessment  found  $6.3  billion  in  increased/retained  sales;  $2.2
billion  in  modernization  investment;  and  53,000  jobs  created  or  retained.  These
documented results represent only a small portion of the MEP’s total impact. We
get these impressive results from a federal investment of only $104 million. What
other federal programs to support manufacturers show a similar documented re-
turn on investment? Given the MEP’s success rate and that small- and medium-
sized  manufacturers  are  struggling  in  the  face  of  global  competition,  why  does
the Administration want to cut the MEP budget by more than 50 percent?

A6. Please refer to the response above.

NOAA
Q7. Despite  the  findings  released  in  last  week’s  Working  Group  I  report  of  the  UN’s
Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change,  the  budget  proposal  cuts  funding
for NOAA’s Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) by 7.4 percent. This is the
fourth  year  in  a  row  for  steep  cuts  to  climate  science.  How  can  you  justify  this
cut  when  even  the  President  recognized  the  problem  of  climate  change  in  his
State of the Union address only one month ago?

A7. The 2007 CCSP figures included in the 2008 President’s Budget were based on
estimates of anticipated appropriations for the CCSP agencies at the time the Budg-
et  was  submitted.  Actual  appropriations,  made  after  the  2008  Budget  was  sub-
mitted,  varied  from  those  estimates;  therefore,  the  2007  CCSP  figures  provided  in
the  2008  Budget  were  not  accurate.  In  addition,  the  2008  CCSP  funding  data  were
also not final estimates. The Administration continues its strong support for the Cli-
mate Change Science Program in 2008. Final estimates of government-wide expend-
itures  for  2007  enacted  and  2008  proposed  funding  levels  will  be  available  in  the
FY 2008 Federal Climate Change Expenditures Report, which is expected to be pub-
lished in early May.

National Science Foundation
Q8. Nanotechnology—The  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  National  Nanotechnology
Initiative  (NNI)  is  $1.45  billion,  which  is  roughly  four  percent  above  the  FY
2007 funding estimate. As you are aware, there have been many calls from aca-
demia  and  industry  for  a  more  robust  and  more  tightly  focused  research  effort
on  the  environmental,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  aspects  of  nanotechnology.  The
funding  allocated  for  EHS  research  under  the  NNI  program  has  been  about
three  percent  of  the  total  program,  and  some  outside  groups  have  claimed  this
is  an  overly  optimistic  estimate.  How  does  the  FY  2008  budget  for  the  NNI  re-
flect  these  repeated  calls  for  significant  growth  of  funding  for  research  in  this
area?

A8. Please see response to Chairman Gordon’s seventh question.
Q9. Overall  funding  for  K–12  programs  in  the  FY08  request  is  flat  compared  to  the
President’s FY07 request. As an engineer and former educator, I understand the
critical importance of STEM education to our children, and the need to support
this  if  we  want  to  maintain  America’s  competitive  and  innovative  edge  in  the
world.  Can  you  elaborate  on  why  you  have  not  put  more  emphasis  on  K–12
STEM education, to ensure that we are raising the next generation of engineers,
scientists, and teachers?

A9. Please see response to Representative Johnson’s third question.
Q10. Last  year,  the  success  rates  at  NSF  dipped  to  approximately  21  percent,  the
lowest success rate in approximately 15 years. Moreover, there are concerns that
to  increase  success  rates  at  NSF  will  attempt  to  limit  the  number  of  proposals
that any one institution can submit to large grant solicitations, effectively plac-
ing  the  burden  of  peer  review  on  universities  who  are  being  forced  to  conduct
their own internal proposal reviews. Two questions: First, what are the success
rates  expected  to  be  with  the  increased  NSF  funding  levels  proposed  in  the
budget? Second, do you support institutions limitations on the number of grant
awards  that  can  be  submitted  by  a  given  university,  even  though  the  quality
of  two  proposals  submitted  from  one  institution  might  be  better  than  one  sub-
mission made from another institution?

A10. Success  rates  are  a  function  of  the  number  of  proposals  submitted  versus  the
available  funding  for  a  given  program.  Although  it  is  assumed  that  an  increase  in
budget  would  result  in  an  increase  in  proposal  success  rates,  we  have  seen  during
the doubling of the NIH budget that an increase in budget can generate enthusiasm
and  draw  people  to  a  field,  having  the  ultimate  effect  of  further  reducing  success
rates.  Therefore,  while  success  rates  can  be  informative  of  important  trends,  such
as  oversupply  or  undersupply  of  scientists  in  a  particular  field,  budget  decisions
should  not  be  based  solely  on  success  rates  since  both  an  increase  and  a  decrease
in  funds  could  equally  result  in  reduced  success  rates.  I  would  expect  that  an  in-
crease in the NSF’s budget might have the initial effect of increasing success rates,
but could result in an overall further decline in success rates as more scientists are
attracted  to  well-funded  fields  of  research.  NSF  can  also  see  an  increase  in  pro-
posals from established researchers as mission agencies (in particular NIH and De-
fense)  adjust  their  priorities  and  the  focus  of  their  extramural  research  portfolios.
I do not believe that NSF should artificially increase success rates by limiting the
number  of  grant  proposals  that  are  submitted  by  individual  universities.  However,
I  am  sympathetic  that  as  NSF’s  budget  increases  and  more  proposals  are  received
for  various  reasons,  there  are  additional  stresses  on  already  taxed  personnel,  man-
agement,  and  information  technology  systems  which  will  all  need  to  be  addressed.
I  support  NSF’s  interest  in  looking  for  new  ways  to  streamline  the  proposal  review
process,  such  as  through  the  use  of  pre-proposals.  At  present,  there  are  over  350
active  funding  opportunities  at  NSF  to  which  proposers  may  submit  proposals.  Of
these,  31  (less  than  ten  percent)  impose  some  sort  of  limit  on  proposal  submissions
from  a  single  institution.  One  of  the  primary  reasons  that  a  program  may  impose
a  limit  on  the  number  of  submissions  from  a  single  institution  is  that  investing  in
building  large  infrastructure,  developing  broad  partnerships,  and  establishing  re-
search  centers  ought  to  be  done  in  the  context  of  an  institution’s  longer-term  stra-
tegic  priorities,  to  ensure  that  these  efforts  will  be  sustained  beyond  the  life  of  the
NSF  award.  In  addition,  for  programs  with  very  broad  appeal,  imposing  institu-
tional submission limitations helps to broaden participation to include more, diverse
institutions.  Artificially  increasing  success  rates  is  not  one  of  the  reasons  for  lim-
iting proposal submissions.

Department of Defense
Q11. In  preparation  for  the  Administration’s  FY08  budget,  last  summer  you  [Dr.
Marburger] and OMB Director Rob Portman issued a memorandum on the Ad-
ministration’s  R&D  budget  priorities.  In  that  memo,  you  noted  the  importance
of continuing the American Competitiveness Initiative investments in the NSF,
the  DOE’s  Office  of  Science,  and  NIST.  You  also  specifically  noted  the  ‘‘high-
impact  basic  and  applied  research  of  the  Department  of  Defense  should  be  a
significant priority.’’ The Pentagon apparently did not get or ignored the memo-
randum, because its requested funding level for DOD basic research is 8.7 per-
cent below the FY07 funding level and only 0.4 percent above the FY07 budget
request.  For  that  matter,  the  FY08  budget  request  for  DOD  science  and  tech-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 20:00 Apr 29, 2007 Jkt 033106 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL07\021407\33106 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

59

nology accounts calls for a 19.2 percent cut in funding from the FY07 funding
level and 2.7 percent below the FY07 budget request.
First,  can  you  explain  why  DOD  research  is  not  part  of  the  Administration’s
American  Competitive  Initiative?  Second,  regardless  of  whether  defense  re-
search  is  part  of  the  ACI,  why,  despite  all  the  rhetorical  support  for  defense
research, aren’t the basic research accounts increasing?

A11. Unfortunately,  the  research  budget  picture  at  the  Department  of  Defense  is
severely distorted by earmarks, which account for all of the 19 percent cut you refer
to.  In  FY  2007,  there  were  over  600  DOD  research  earmarks  (6.1  and  6.2)  totaling
$1.2 billion. This research is not merit reviewed and is often outside of DOD’s mis-
sion. For instance, Congress directed DOD to fund research on a wide range of dis-
eases  including  diabetes,  neurofibromatosis  (a  genetic  disorder  of  the  nervous  sys-
tem),  and  childhood  cancer.  Congressional  adds  in  DOD’s  budget  for  medical  re-
search projects total about $500 million in 2007 alone. While research on these dis-
eases  is  very  important,  these  diseases  are  not  unique  to  the  U.S.  military  and  the
research can be better selected, carried out and coordinated within civil medical re-
search  agencies,  without  disruption  to  the  military  mission.  At  the  same  time,  the
intrusion  of  earmarking  into  the  peer-review  processes  of  civilian  medical  research
agencies would have a significant detrimental impact on funding the most important
and promising research.

It  is  true  that  DOD  research  helps  to  drive  innovation  and  makes  valuable  con-
tributions  toward  the  goals  of  the  ACI.  As  the  ACI  policy  booklet  stated:  ‘‘The  De-
partment  of  Defense. . .provides  strong  support  for  the  physical  sciences  and  engi-
neering,  including  projects  with  both  commercial  and  military  applications  (‘‘dual-
use’’  technologies).  Past  DOD  research  has  resulted  in  revolutionary  technological
capabilities  such  as  radar,  digital  computers,  wireless  mobile  communications,  la-
sers,  fiber  optics,  composite  materials,  the  Internet  (and  other  ‘‘packet  switched’’
networks), and satellite navigation.’’ This research has grown by nearly $850 million
since  2001.  DOD  will  continue  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  American  Competi-
tiveness  Initiative.  The  ACI  does  not  place  all  agencies  important  to  its  goals  on  a
budget-doubling track because the current budget status of agencies varies with re-
spect  to  the  challenges,  opportunities,  and  capacities  related  to  long-term  economic
competitiveness.  DOD’s  current  nearly  $6  billion  research  budget  positions  it  well
relative to other key ACI agencies to play its historical role in these areas, especially
if currently earmarked funds become available for priority research areas.
