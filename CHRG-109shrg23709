ALASKA  AVIATION 

TUESDAY,  JULY  5,  2005

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

Anchorage, Alaska. 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  9:30  a.m.  in  the 
Loussac  Library,  Anchorage,  Alaska,  Hon.  Ted  Stevens,  Chairman 
of the Committee, presiding. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS,

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Good  morning,  I  thank  you  all  for  being  here. 
Thank you for making the trip to Alaska. It’s an honor to have you 
both here to testify today. 

As  you  know,  Alaska  depends  on  aviation  more  than  any  other 
state.  Over  70  percent  of  our  cities  and  towns  are  reached  by  air; 
that’s year-around. And as you know, instead of cars and buses, we 
have airplanes and aircraft. 

Alaska  has  7  times  more  licensed  pilots  than  the  national  aver-
age.  About  21,000  active  pilots;  nearly  10,000  registered  aircraft. 
Our state accounts for 20 percent of the air space that you admin-
ister. 

And as our skies get more congested, it’s important to utilize this 

air space effectively and efficiently. 

We  have  new  innovations  such  as  Capstone  and  Medallion;  and 
both have had your full support. We thank you for that. I look for-
ward to your testimony in this regard. 

We  have  very  substantial  reliance  upon  the  program  for  Essen-
tial  Air  Service,  as  you  know,  and  that  Essential  Air  Service  gives 
us access to hospitals, mail service, food, and basic supplies. We’ve 
also been working with you on lighting. It’s very difficult to assure 
essential lighting for Alaska’s rural airports, and we’ve managed to 
obtain substantial funds in the last 4 years, and I’m pleased to say 
that  we  have  had  additional  infrastructure  for  nearly  50  commu-
nities  through  that  program,  and  we’re  hopeful  that  by  the  time 
Alaska  reaches  our  50th  anniversary  of  statehood  every—every 
runway in the state will have runway lights. 

I  could  go  on  and  on  listening  to  the  two  of  you.  You’re  great 
friends  of  Alaska  and  personally.  And  I  welcome  you  to  this  beau-
tiful state. We have some spectacular weather for you. 

Mr. Mineta, Norm. Please have your say.

STATEMENT OF HON. NORMAN Y. MINETA, SECRETARY,

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
Mr. MINETA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Let me, first of all, thank you for the invitation to appear at this 
hearing. It’s always a pleasure to join you here in Alaska, particu-
larly  when  the  sun  shines  most  every  hour  of  the  day.  I  couldn’t 
get  over  the  fact  that  at  11  o’clock  last  night  it  still  seemed  like 
6 o’clock at home. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Norm,  they  see  us  all  night  in  the  summer  and 

we leave tracks in the winter. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. MINETA. Administrator Blakey and I are here to discuss sev-
eral  important  issues  related  to  aviation  in  Alaska.  The  United 
States  Department  of  Transportation  is  very  well  aware  of  the  ab-
solutely critical role that aviation plays in the lives of all Alaskans. 
In  addition  to  its  important  place  in  Alaskan  society,  aviation 
faces  unique  conditions  here  that  set  it  apart  from  the  Lower  48 
in many respects. 

Administrator  Blakey  will  testify  about  the  significant  work  of 
the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  in  promoting  and  enhancing 
safety. 

I will speak about the aviation programs that are within my own 
offices  that  have  a  direct  daily  impact  on  aviation  and  air  service 
in the State of Alaska. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  my  written  state-

ment be included as part of the hearing record. 

The CHAIRMAN. It will be. Thank you. 
Mr. MINETA. The Department of Transportation’s Office of Inter-
national  Aviation  and—or  Aviation  and  International  Affairs,  has 
worked to liberalize air service markets throughout the world, and 
we have had considerable success. And in terms of these liberalized 
markets,  they  have  allowed  for  expanded  flow  of  goods  and  people 
that benefit our economy and those of our trading partners. 

Since  coming  into  office,  the  Bush  Administration  has  executed 
17 new Open Skies Agreements, for a total of 71 Open Skies Agree-
ments with other economies in force at the present time. 

Our  liberalization  efforts  provide  the  foundation  for  the  kind  of 
growth in air services that have benefited the Ted Stevens Anchor-
age International Airport, which is a natural transfer for routes be-
tween  the  Lower  48  states,  the  moving  Asian  economies,  and  Eu-
rope. 

As  a  result  of  these  actions,  as  well  as  the  tremendous  work  of 
the  FAA  and  their  Alaska  region  Administrator,  Pat  Poe,  and  the 
outstanding leadership of Mort Plumb, the director of the Ted Ste-
vens  Anchorage  International  Airport,  and  the  infrastructure  im-
provements  that  have  been  made  at  the  airport,  the  level  of  air 
cargo  activity  in  Anchorage  has  increased  substantially  in  recent 
years. 

The  number  of  air  cargo  landings  has  increased  from  less  than 
14,000 in 1988, to more than 42,000 in 2004. A more than threefold 
increase. 

In fact, our recent landmark agreement with China has resulted 
in more than 20 additional all cargo flights by U.S. carriers in and 
out of Anchorage each week.

We  will  continue  to  work  actively  to  open  international  air  serv-
ice  markets  to  the  benefit  of  businesses,  communities,  and  con-
sumers  in  Alaska,  and  everyone  else  in  the  continental  United 
States. 

As you know so very well, with respect to programs and activities 
that  are  focused  within  the  state,  the  Department  administers  the 
Essential Air Service Program and sets air transportation rates for 
intra-Alaska bypass mail. 

I  can  assure  you  that  the  Department  is  committed  to  insuring 
that  air  service  in  Alaska  is  frequent,  safe,  and  affordable  for  pas-
sengers and freight shippers, as well as for the United States Post-
al Service. 

Under  the  EAS  program,  the  Department  provides  a  safety  net 
level  of  air  service  to  the  smallest  and  most  isolated  communities. 
Given  that  air  service  is  typically  the  only  access  to  Alaskan  vil-
lages,  the  Department  has  regarded  EAS  to  these  remote  commu-
nities  as  a  very  high  priority;  and  we  give  great  weight  to  the 
needs and opinions of the affected communities. 

For  example,  we  have  just  this  year  increased  air  service  to 
Akutan  from  the  prior  subsidized  level  because  we  recognize  that, 
with the growth in that market, traffic could not be reasonably ac-
commodated with the previous lower level of scheduled service. 

Likewise,  we  also  selected  Alaska  Airlines  to  provide  subsidized 
service  at  Adak,  and  notwithstanding  another  proposal,  for  a  mil-
lion  dollars  less  per  year,  because  we  recognize  the  extreme  isola-
tion  of  Adak  and  the  need  for  jet  aircraft  to  fly  the  1200  miles  to 
Anchorage. 

However, the story is different in the Lower 48, and I would like 
your  support  in  working  with  the  Congress  in  making  some  much 
needed  structural  changes  to  the  program.  While  some  subsidized 
communities in the Lower 48 are indeed isolated; many others are 
not.  I  think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  subsidized  air  service  is  not  truly 
essential for too many communities in the Lower 48. 

If the program is not refocused on only the communities that are 
most  in  need,  the  costs  threaten  to  grow  even  larger.  So  I  stand 
willing  to  work  with  you  and  the  Committee  on  ways  we  can  all 
make  the  EAS  program  better,  because  it  is  currently  not  struc-
tured in a way that makes sense for the current state of air trans-
portation in our country. 

Mr.  Chairman,  due  to  your  leadership  and  strong  efforts,  Con-
gress  passed  the  Rural  Service  Improvement  Act  of  2002,  which 
significantly  revamped  the  bypass  mail  system  within  the  state  of 
Alaska. 

The  two  main  goals  of  RSIA  were,  one,  to  increase  the  amount 
of flying with larger aircraft under Part 121 Safety Standards; and, 
two, to reduce the Postal Service’s expenditures. 

While the industry is still adjusting to the new law, the early re-

turns are that both of your main objectives are being met. 

RSIA recognized that two central problems with the bypass mail 
system  had  developed  since  its  inauguration.  First,  a  class  of  car-
riers  had  developed  and  focused  on  mail  to  the  exclusion  of  pas-
sengers and freight. RSI compared air service in Alaska to a three-
legged  stool  that  supports  passengers,  freight,  and  mail  service.

And it recognized that if there was focus by any party on only one 
leg of the stool, such as mail, the overall stool would be weakened. 
Second,  RSIA  recognized  that  the  longstanding  simple  mail  rate 
structure of separate bush and mainline classes of mail ignored the 
increasing  development  of  modern  turbo-prop  equipment  and  the 
potential  benefits  they  presented  to  passengers  from  their  greater 
speed  and  safety  and  to  the  Postal  Service  from  their  lower  costs. 
To  fully  realize  those  advances,  RSIA  divided  the  single  bush 
mail  rate  into  three  separate  classes.  Putting  the  goals  of  larger, 
safer  aircraft  in  conjunction  with  reduced  Postal  Service  expendi-
tures produced a win-win result. 

RSIA  directed  the  Department  to  carve  out  three  separate  bush 
rates, which we have done. In rough terms, the new Part 121 rate 
developed  by  the  Department  is  one  half  the  former  unitary  rate; 
the  Part  135  rate  is  the  same  as  the  former  unitary  rate;  and  the 
seaplane rate is double than the earlier single rate. The new rates 
have  resulted  in  more  equitable,  and  I  believe,  more  efficient  air 
services. 

In closing, Mr. Chairman, let me reaffirm the Department’s com-

mitment to small community air service, especially in Alaska. 

We  look  forward  to  working  with  you  and  the  Members  of  your 

Committee as we continue to work toward these objectives. 

[The prepared statement of Secretary Mineta follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. NORMAN Y. MINETA, SECRETARY,

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  this  hearing.  It  is  a  pleasure  to  join 
you here in Alaska. Administrator Blakey, Regional Administrator Poe and I all ap-
preciate  this  opportunity  to  discuss  with  you  important  issues  related  to  aviation 
in  Alaska.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  is  well  aware  of  the  absolutely 
critical role that aviation plays in the lives of all Alaskans. In addition to its impor-
tant place in Alaskan society, aviation faces unique conditions here that set it apart 
from the rest of the United States in many respects. So we are here today to address 
a  number  of  the  aviation  issues  that  matter  most  to  your  constituents.  In  that  re-
gard,  Administrator  Blakey  will  testify  about  the  significant  work  of  the  Federal 
Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  in  promoting  and  enhancing  safety.  But  first,  I  will 
speak  about  the  aviation  programs  within  my  own  office  that  have  a  direct,  daily 
impact on aviation and air service in the State of Alaska. 

As  an  initial  matter,  the  Office  of  International  Aviation  has  worked  for  many 
years to liberalize air service markets throughout the world—and we have had con-
siderable success. Liberalized markets allow for expanded flows of goods and people 
that benefit our economy and those of our partners. Recently, we have signed Open 
Skies  agreements  with  India  and  Indonesia  and  obtained  much  greater  access  to 
China.  Our  liberalization  efforts  provide  the  foundation  for  the  kind  of  growth  in 
cargo services that have benefited Ted Stevens International Airport, which is a nat-
ural transfer hub for routes between the lower 48 states, the booming Asian econo-
mies, and Europe. 

In  connection  with  the  Department’s  actions  generally  to  open  opportunities  for 
air  cargo  activities,  in  2004,  new  federal  legislation  was  passed  that  substantially 
augments the liberal air cargo transfer rights that existed at Alaskan airports prior 
to this legislation due to the Department’s earlier actions. As a result of this legisla-
tion, foreign carriers may now transfer and carry international origin or destination 
cargo  between  Alaska  and  other  points  in  the  United  States  that  was  previously 
prohibited by federal law. 

As  a  result  of  the  above  actions  by  the  Department  and  the  Congress,  as  well  as 
the infrastructure improvements made by the airports, the level of air cargo activity 
at  Anchorage  has  increased  substantially  in  recent  years.  The  number  of  air  cargo 
landings has increased from less than 14,000 in 1988 to more than 42,000 in 2004, 
a  more  than  three-fold  increase.  As  these  numbers  show,  when  carriers  are  given 
liberal  opportunities  to  serve  an  airport  and  the  airport  takes  steps  to  make  its  fa-
cilities  attractive,  this  can  lead  to  substantial  increases  in  the  level  of  operations

at  that  airport.  We  will  continue  to  work  actively  to  open  international  air  service 
markets to the benefit of businesses, communities and consumers in Alaska and ev-
eryone else in the United States. 

As you know, with respect to programs and activities that are focused within the 
state,  the  Department  administers  the  Essential  Air  Service  (EAS)  program  and 
sets  air  transportation  rates  for  Intra-Alaska  Bypass  Mail.  With  regard  to  both  of 
these responsibilities, I can assure you that the Department is committed to ensur-
ing  that  air  service  in  Alaska  is  frequent,  safe,  and  affordable,  for  passengers  and 
freight shippers, as well as for the Postal Service. 

It  is  clear  that  air  service  in  Alaska,  as  well  as  the  rest  of  the  country,  has 
changed  dramatically  over  time.  In  the  days  before  airline  deregulation,  there  was 
a  sign  outside  a  Wien  Air  Alaska  station  advising  prospective  passengers  that  if 
they  did  not  arrive  within  one  hour  of  the  scheduled  flight,  Wien  would  bump  the 
passenger  in  favor  of  delivering  an  extra  200  pounds  of  mail  or  freight  from  its 
backlog. The competitive pressure of deregulation was designed to help address such 
issues of poor service for passengers, freight, and mail. 

In administering the EAS program, the Department ensures that communities re-
ceive  a  safety-net  level  of  service  when  they  are  too  small  or  too  remote  to  receive 
market-driven service. Likewise, with the Department setting mail rates in Alaska, 
the  Department  ensures  that  carriers  are  fairly  compensated  for  transporting  the 
mail,  and  also  that  mail,  freight,  and  passenger  service  work  in  tandem  like  the 
‘‘separate legs of a stool.’’

The  critical  importance  of  mail  and  air  service  to  Alaska’s  regional  hubs  and  vil-
lages will continue for the foreseeable future. The Department seeks to ensure that 
there  is  an  integrated  transportation  system  that  can  provide  benefit  to  all.  This 
challenge—and  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  not  use  the  word  ‘‘challenge’’  lightly—requires 
that  the  Federal  Government  wisely  manage  programs  affecting  intra-Alaska  serv-
ice. 
Essential Air Service Program (EAS) 

The Department has administered the EAS program since deregulation of the air-
lines  in  1978.  The  laws  governing  EAS  have  not  changed  significantly  since  its  in-
ception  more  than  25  years  ago  notwithstanding  the  dramatic  changes  that  have 
taken  place  in  the  airline  industry.  Under  that  program,  the  Department  provides 
a  safety-net  level  of  air  service  to  the  smallest  and  most  isolated  communities. 
Given  that  air  service  is  typically  the  only  access  to  Alaskan  villages,  the  Depart-
ment has regarded EAS to these communities as a very high priority. 

Although  we  take  our  fiscal  responsibilities  quite  seriously,  the  Department  has 
not  administered  the  EAS  program  in  a  way  as  to  merely  minimize  our  expendi-
tures.  We  give  great  weight  to  the  needs  and  opinions  of  the  affected  communities, 
as  mandated  by  Congress  in  section  41733(c)(1)(d)  of  the  statute.  For  example,  we 
have  just  this  year  increased  air  service  to  Akutan  from  the  prior  subsidized  level, 
because we recognized that with the growth in that market, traffic could not be rea-
sonably accommodated with the previous, lower level of scheduled service. Likewise, 
we  selected  Alaska  Airlines  to  provide  subsidized  service  at  Adak,  notwithstanding 
that  there  was  another  proposal  for  a  million  dollars  less  per  year  in  subsidy,  be-
cause  we  recognized  the  extreme  isolation  of  Adak,  and  the  need  for  jet  aircraft  to 
fly the 1,200 miles to Anchorage. 

However, the story is different in the lower 48 states, and I would like your sup-
port in working with the Congress in making some much-needed structural changes 
to the program. While many communities in the lower 48 are indeed isolated, many 
others are not. Many communities are within 40–50 miles of an airport with plenty 
of jet service but, because it might be categorized as a small hub, those communities 
are  entitled  to  subsidized  air  service.  And  that  can  be  the  case  even  though  many, 
if not most, air travelers in the community drive to the nearby airport because they 
prefer its broader array of prices and services. 

Under current law, a community’s eligibility for inclusion in the EAS program has 
been  based  only  on  whether  it  was  listed  on  a  carrier’s  certificate  on  the  date  the 
program  was  enacted—October  24,  1978.  Once  subsidized  service  was  established, 
there was little incentive for active community involvement to help ensure that the 
service  being  subsidized  would  ultimately  be  successful.  I  can  tell  you  anecdotally 
that  many  EAS  communities  in  the  lower  48  do  not  even  display  their  subsidized 
EAS  flights  on  their  homepages,  but  do  show  the  availability  of  air  service,  espe-
cially  low-fare  service,  at  nearby  hubs.  As  a  result,  EAS-subsidized  flights  are  fre-
quently not well patronized and our funds are not being used as efficiently or effec-
tively as possible. 

As  you  know,  in  2003  the  Administration  began  proposing  significant  reforms  for 
the  EAS  program.  Under  the  Administration’s  proposal,  communities  are  asked  to

6

become  partners  in  the  financing  of  their  air  services.  In  exchange,  they  are  given 
a much bigger role in determining the nature of that service. As a result, currently 
eligible  communities  would  remain  eligible,  but  would  have  an  array  of  new  trans-
portation options available to them for access to the national air transportation sys-
tem.  In  addition  to  the  traditional  EAS  of  two  or  three  round  trips  a  day  to  a  hub, 
the  communities  would  have  the  alternatives  of  charter  flights,  air  taxi  service,  or 
ground  transportation  links.  Regionalized  air  service  might  also  be  possible,  where 
several  communities  could  be  served  through  one  airport,  but  with  larger  aircraft 
or more frequent flights. 

Under  the  Department’s  proposal,  community  participation  would  be  determined 
by the degree of its isolation from the national transportation system. The most re-
mote communities (those greater than 210 highway miles from the nearest large or 
medium hub airport) would be required to provide only 10 percent of the total EAS 
subsidy  costs.  Communities  that  are  within  a  close  drive  of  major  airports  would 
not  qualify  for  subsidized  air  service,  but  would  receive  subsidies  constituting  50 
percent  of  the  total  costs  for  providing  surface  transportation  links  to  a  nearby  air-
port  with  better  service.  Specifically,  communities  within:  (a)  100  driving  miles  of 
a large or medium hub airport, (b) 75 miles of a small hub, or (c) 50 miles of a non-
hub with jet service would not qualify for subsidized air service. All other EAS com-
munities would have to cover 25 percent of the subsidy costs attributable to the pro-
vision of air service. 

The  proposed  small-hub  and  non-hub  criteria  are  important.  Under  current  law, 
communities  located  within  70  miles  of  a  large  or  medium  hub  are  not  eligible  for 
subsidized  air  service,  on  the  principle  that  passengers  find  driving  to  such  nearby 
service  too  attractive  an  alternative  for  the  subsidized  service  to  compete  against. 
Our proposal extends that same principle in a measured way to small hubs and non-
hubs  offering  jet  service,  applying  tighter  proximity  standards  in  line  with  the 
smaller size of the alternate service. 

We  believe  that  this  approach  would  allow  the  Department  to  provide  the  most 
isolated  communities  with  air  service  that  is  tailored  to  their  individual  needs.  Im-
portantly, it provides communities in the program greater participation, control, and 
flexibility  over  how  to  meet  their  air  service  needs,  and  a  far  greater  incentive  to 
promote  the  success  of  those  services.  In  this  time  of  fiscal  constraint,  Congress 
would  be  recognizing  the  need  to  responsibly  trim  the  costs  of  the  program,  while 
simultaneously  protecting  the  needs  of  those  communities  most  deserving  of  sup-
port. 

I  am  well  aware  that  the  proposed  requirement  of  a  local  contribution  has  not 
been  well  received  by  many.  But  this  is  one  of  the  few  federal  programs  that  does 
not  have  any  local  contribution.  In  the  Department’s  Small  Community  Air  Service 
Development  Program,  we  have  found  that  many  communities  are  willing  and  able 
to make contributions to improve their local air services. As with that program, the 
local contributions in the reformed EAS program would not have to be made by local 
governments—for  example,  local  businesses  or  the  state  government  could  provide 
the  needed  financial  support.  Nonetheless,  I  understand  the  concerns  you  have  ex-
pressed about this in the past. In that respect, I stand willing to work with you and 
the  Committee  on  ways  we  can  all  make  the  EAS  program  better,  because  it  cur-
rently is not structured in a way that makes sense for the current state of air trans-
portation in this country. 
Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002 (RSIA) 

Due  to  your  efforts,  Mr.  Chairman,  Congress  passed  the  Rural  Service  Improve-
ment  Act  of  2002,  which  significantly  revamped  the  mail  system  within  the  state. 
The  two  main  goals  of  RSIA  were  to  increase  the  amount  of  flying  with  larger  air-
craft  under  Part  121  safety  standards  and  to  reduce  the  Postal  Service’s  expendi-
tures. While the industry is still adjusting to the new law, the early returns are that 
both of your main objectives are being met. 

As  background,  the  Postal  Service  is  responsible  for  paying  for  the  delivery  of 
mail within Alaska, as well as ensuring that mail is equitably tendered to qualifying 
carriers,  while  the  Department  is  charged  with  setting  the  rates  that  the  Postal 
Service  pays  the  airlines.  Under  the  bypass  system,  goods  bound  for  the  commu-
nities,  including  critical  food  and  medicine  moving  as  mail,  bypass  the  physical  fa-
cilities  of  the  Postal  Service.  Instead,  the  bypass  shipper  is  directed  to  deliver  the 
mail shipment directly to a particular airline, where a Postal Service official weighs, 
tracks, and records the shipment before its embarks. 

RSIA  recognized  that  two  central  problems  with  the  mail  system  had  developed 
since  its  inauguration.  First,  a  class  of  carriers  had  developed  that  focused  on  mail 
to  the  exclusion  of  passengers  or  freight.  RSIA  compared  air  service  in  Alaska  to 
a  three-legged  stool.  It  recognized  that  if  there  was  focus  by  any  party  on  only  one

leg of the stool, such as mail, the overall stool would be weakened. For illustration, 
if  there  is  only  enough  traffic  at  a  village  to  support  four  round  trips  a  week,  that 
village  is  clearly  better  off  receiving  passenger  and  mail  combination  service  each 
of  those  four  days,  rather  than  mail-only  service  on  two  days  and  passenger-only 
service on those other two days. RSIA encouraged just such a result by establishing 
two separate pools for passenger and freight carriers for each village. Passenger car-
riers  transporting  more  than  20  percent  of  total  passengers  in  a  village  were  to 
share 70 percent of the mail, and freight carriers transporting more than 25 percent 
of the freight in a village were to receive 20 percent of the total mail to that village. 
The  remaining  ten  percent  of  the  mail  was  reserved,  for  a  five-year  transition  pe-
riod,  for  the  carriers  that  did  not  qualify  for  either  of  those  two  pools.  RSIA  con-
templated those mail-only carriers would either convert to passenger/freight service 
or  go  out  of  business.  Before  RSIA,  three  carriers  relied  more  heavily  on  mail  than 
any of the other bush carriers—Bellair, Village Aviation, and Servant Air. Mail con-
stituted more than 95 percent of each of those carriers’ total traffic, and each carrier 
has since ceased operations, though Servant is now operating under new ownership 
and  management.  The  mail  from  those  three  carriers  is  now  available  to  support 
combination passenger and freight service by the surviving carriers. (For a compari-
son of carrier traffic from calendar year 2000, before RSIA, to that of traffic in 2004, 
see Appendix A.) 

Second, RSIA recognized that the longstanding simple mail rate structure of sepa-
rate  bush  and  mainline  classes  of  mail  ignored  the  increasing  development  of  mod-
ern  turboprop  equipment,  and  the  potential  benefits  they  presented  to  passengers 
from their greater speed and safety and to the Postal Service from their lower costs. 
To  fully  realize  those  advances,  RSIA  divided  the  single  bush  mail  rate  into  three 
separate  classes.  Putting  the  goals  of  larger,  safer  aircraft  in  conjunction  with  re-
duced Postal Service expenditures produced a win-win result. With respect to saving 
the  Postal  Service  money,  service  with  larger  bush  aircraft  is  more  cost  efficient  in 
moving larger volumes of mail in larger markets. 

Previously,  the  Department  had  set  a  single  bush  mail  rate  for  all  carriers  oper-
ating  equipment  with  a  payload  of  less  than  7,500  pounds  (about  30  seats).  RSIA 
directed the Department to carve out three separate rates: for 19-seat or larger air-
craft  operating  under  the  more  stringent  FAA  Part  121  standards;  for  smaller  air-
craft  operating  under  Part  135;  and  a  separate  rate  for  seaplane  aircraft,  recog-
nizing  the  higher  cost  of  operating  to  villages  accessible  only  by  those  aircraft.  The 
Department  has  done  as  RSIA  dictated:  last  year  we  issued  4  orders  establishing 
these  new  rates.  In  rough  terms,  the  new  Part  121  rate  developed  by  the  Depart-
ment  is  one-half  of  the  former  unitary  rate,  the  Part  135  rate  is  the  same  as  the 
former  unitary  rate,  and  the  Seaplane  rate  is  double  that  earlier  single  rate.  Be-
cause larger Part 121 service is operationally limited to the biggest airports and eco-
nomically to the largest villages with the most mail, and Seaplane operations to the 
smallest,  the  Postal  Service  is  clearly  saving  significant  funds  from  this  restruc-
turing of bush mail rates. 

RSIA also tried to ensure that passengers at larger villages be served with larger 
19-seat aircraft operating under more stringent FAA Part 121 operating standards. 
With the goals of saving the Postal Service money and encouraging Part 121 service, 
the Department established another class rate based on the costs of more expensive 
19-seat  Part  121  aircraft,  such  as  ERA  Aviation’s  Twin  Otters,  which  have  short 
takeoff  and  landing  capabilities  lacking  in  other  19-seat  equipment.  Only  Twin  Ot-
ters  and  smaller  Part  135  aircraft  are  capable  of  landing  at  very  short  runway  air-
ports.  Without  the  Department  creating  a  mail  rate  intermediate  between  the  high 
cost  of  Part  135  service,  and  the  low  cost  of  regular  Part  121  service,  those  short 
runway  communities  served  by  ERA’s  Twin  Otters  would  have  lost  that  service  in 
lieu  of  less  commodious  Part  135  aircraft,  and  the  Postal  Service  would  have  had 
to pay more for it as well. 

I should also mention that the Department has recently granted the Postal Serv-
ice  an  exemption  to  pay  more  than  the  Part  121  rate,  but  still  less  than  the  Part 
135  rate,  on  a  market-by-market  basis,  in  order  to  ensure  that  carriers  would  con-
tinue  to  operate  with  Part  121  service  to  many  communities  rather  than  remove 
seats  from  aircraft  to  fall  within  the  Part  135  rate.  Although  the  exemption  is  cur-
rently  on  appeal,  and  accordingly  I  am  limited  in  what  I  can  say  about  it,  I  do  be-
lieve  that  this  decision  is  consistent  with  RSIA’s  aims  and  helps  ensure  that  unin-
tended  consequences  of  a  three-rate  structure  do  not  redound  to  the  detriment  of 
Alaskan consumers or the Post Office. 

In closing, Mr. Chairman, let me reaffirm the Department’s commitment to small 
community, and especially Alaska, air service. We look forward to working with you 
and the Members of this Committee as we continue to work toward these objectives. 
Thank  you  again.  This  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  will  now  ask  that  Ad-

Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  now  like  to  ask  Administrator  Blakey  to 
discuss the safety issues. And at the end of her prepared remarks, 
we will be more than happy to answer any questions that you may 
have. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

STATEMENT OF HON. MARION C. BLAKEY, ADMINISTRATOR,

FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION 

Ms.  BLAKEY.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  good  morning  to  a 
very distinguished group. It’s wonderful to be back here in Alaska. 
I have to say, every time I am here I am overwhelmed with what 

a magnificent state Alaska is.

Known  as  the  Final  Frontier,  from  where  I  sit,  it  is  really  the 
front door on aviation safety in the United States. I’m very excited 
to see what’s going on. 

When  I  was  here  2  years  ago,  I  made  it  to  the  Arctic  Circle.  I 
flew on a Capstone-equipped float plane and on medivac aircraft as 
well. Senator Stevens, you’ve long maintained from the floor of the 
Senate that Alaska is unique. How right you are. 

Because  of  advances  in  Alaska,  it’s  really  a  showplace  for  what 

you can do in aviation. 

Aviation literally is a lifeline to many of the communities in this 
state.  And  because  of  that,  I  very  much  appreciate  the  continued 
efforts of your Committee to work with us and the aviation commu-
nity to make Alaskan aviation as safe and efficient as possible. 

A  few  years  ago  it  became  clear  that  we  needed  to  take  a  dif-
ferent approach to aviation safety in Alaska. The significant safety 
improvements  that  have  been  achieved  in  recent  years  in  Alaska 
demonstrate the real commitment of everyone that’s been involved. 
Alaska has become literally a national asset for innovation. 

You know, when I first came to the FAA, we put in place a stra-
tegic business plan—our Flight Plan we call it—with specific objec-
tives  and  performance  targets.  Alaska  is  the  only  state  mentioned 
by  name  in  the  FAA’s  flight  plan.  This  is  both  because  of  the  ex-
treme importance of aviation to Alaska, and the FAA’s commitment 
to continue to work with our partners in Alaska to keep improving 
the state’s safety record. I’m very happy to report, it’s working. 

In  1999,  OSHA  said  that  being  a  commercial  airline  pilot  is  the 
most  hazardous  job  in  Alaska.  Not  anymore.  Since  then,  the  first 
phase  of  Capstone  has  been  successfully  completed,  and  Phase  II 
is  well  under  way.  In  1999,  there  were  only  10  cameras  providing 
timely weather information to Alaskan pilots. We’ve increased that 
several fold. There are 55 out there now. 

What’s  more,  today  we  have  the  Medallion  Foundation  working 
with  both  commercial  and  with  general  aviation  operators  to  spur 
the  implementation  of  safety  concepts.  We’re  also  making  inroads 
in  terms  of  Alaska’s  infrastructure  as  well.  Back  then,  Alaska  re-
ceived  77.8  million  in  Airport  Improvement  Program  funds;  last 
year  that  number  was  219  million.  Each  of  these  improvements  is 
turning the tide on aviation in Alaska. 

And  please  indulge  me  for  just  a  moment  to  brag  a  bit  more 
about  our  state  here.  In  a  nutshell,  Alaska  is  a  model  for  the  rest 
of  us  on  how  to  improve,  how  to  translate  technology  into  safety. 
As  I  said  a  moment  ago,  I’ve  flown  in  a  Capstone-equipped  air-
craft—in  fact,  several  times—and  seen  firsthand  the  type  of  infor-
mation that’s provided to the pilot. Let me tell you, and explain the 
difference  during  the  flight.  Automatic  Dependence  Surveillance 
Broadcast,  which  most  pilots  refer  to  as  ADSB,  is  key  to  having  a 
pilot  have  accurate  and  timely  information  about  other  aircraft, 
terrain, and weather. And let me emphasize that last one: weather 
is so critical up here. 

The initial focus of Capstone’s first phase was the YK Delta area, 
specifically  160,000  square  miles  all  around  Bethel.  This  area  of 
the  state  had  historically  had  an  accident  rate  that  was  2  to  4 
times higher than the rest of Alaska. But in 2003, the accident rate 
was below average for the rest of the state for the first time.

12

From  2000  to  2004,  the  accident  rate  of  Capstone-equipped  air-

craft decreased by 47 percent versus other aircraft without it. 

The  numbers  would  indicate  that  moving  forward  with  this  ex-
ceptional  program  is  a  good,  solid  idea.  So  we’re  working  on  it. 
We’re  working  with  Phase  II  which  expands  to  southeastern  Alas-
ka,  in  the  Juneau  area;  and  Phase  III  extends  the  program  state-
wide. 

We  haven’t  stopped  there.  By  placing  weather  cameras  through-
out  the  state,  we’ve  certainly  come  a  long  way  since  the  first 
weather  camera  was  on  the  roof  of  your  building  in  Anchorage. 
Today, we have 55 cameras throughout the state; an investment of 
$7  million.  Twelve  new  sites  are  scheduled  to  be  up  and  running 
by this October. This concept, I think, is stunning in its simplicity. 
Most  good  ideas  tend  to  come  from  a  very  simple  idea  when  you 
get down to it. 

The pilot goes on-line, and gets two images for each location. The 
first shows what a site would look like in a perfectly clear-day situ-
ation.  The  second  shows  current  weather  conditions.  For  example, 
pilots  can  now  learn  what  the  visibility  is  in  the  mountain  pass 
they face, and whether they want to fly through it before they take 
off.  In  many  instances,  they  may  decide  not  to  fly,  to  hold  off  on 
that  flight  for  a  while,  depending  upon  what  they  see.  And  that’s 
long  before  they  set  foot  in  the  aircraft.  So  they  really  can  make 
good decisions. 

You  know,  pilots  have  a  maxim  that  rings  especially  true:  It’s 
better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air than in the 
air wishing you were on the ground. 

Last  year  this  website  got  over  2.3  million  hits.  That  number 

should increase by another million this year, we think. 

Pilots  flock  to  a  good  idea,  and  that’s  just  what  they’re  doing 

with the weather cameras. 

Our safety programs in Alaska need to be nimble, and that’s the 
approach  we’re  taking.  The  community  here  has  shown  that  it’s 
unafraid  to  test  new  technologies,  and  that’s  making  a  real  dif-
ference. 

Turning  to  infrastructure  investment,  we’ve  increased  our  AIP 
investment  in  Alaska  to  131  million  a  year  since  1999.  It’s  clear 
that  the  money  is  being  well  spent.  And,  you  know,  a  great  deal 
of the credit for safety improvements that have been made must be 
given to the users of the system themselves. 

I’m pleased you’ve asked Jerry Dennis from the Medallion Foun-
dation  to  appear  on  the  next  panel.  That  organization  has  done 
some really remarkable work, and needs to be applauded. The Me-
dallion program is voluntary and industry-led, and it’s one that the 
FAA  supports  through  a  grant  arrangement.  Alaska’s  air  carriers 
created the program and are participating because they voluntarily 
wanted  to  exceed  FAA  requirements;  and  it’s  making  a  difference. 
Their  success  has  led  to  Medallion  creating  a  component  for  gen-
eral aviation as well. Which I have to say, seems to be greeted with 
overwhelming enthusiasm by the GA community. 

You’ve only got to see how insurance companies award premiums 
to  pilots  and  carriers  of  Medallion  participants  to  understand  how 
seriously this program is being taken. Both Jerry Dennis and Dick 
Harding,  Medallion’s  executive  director  and  president,  deserve

great  credit  for  the  creativity  and  the  willingness  to  make  a  con-
tribution to aviation safety well beyond the State of Alaska. They’re 
working with the GA community; they’re working with us in Wash-
ington to see how this can expand. 

Finally,  I’d  like  to  acknowledge  the  spirit  of  aviation  in  Alaska, 
which  I  think  we  both  agree,  was  personified  by  Tom  Wardleigh. 
He was a master pilot, a master mechanic, and the elder statesman 
of  Alaska  aviation.  Tom’s  vision  is  now  Tom’s  legacy.  First,  I’m 
pleased to say, that Jan is here today to share this occasion. 

That’s why I’m so pleased, with her in the audience, to announce 
the  creation  of  a  national  safety  award  in  his  honor.  The  first  re-
cipient will be announced next year. 

You know, Tom urged us to strive for exceptional customer serv-
ice,  to  be  a  proving  ground  for  new  ideas.  Tom  knew  if  we  could 
make an idea work in Alaska with all the challenges here, it would 
have  benefits  throughout  the  country.  And  that’s  exactly  what’s 
happening  today.  And  that’s  the  reason  this  is  a  national  award. 
Because he was right. The many lives he touched will not soon for-
get Tom Wardleigh, and that’s as it should be. 

So,  once  again,  Mr.  Chairman,  I’m  very  pleased  to  be  here  in 
Alaska.  I  think  you  can  tell.  Blue  skies,  fresh  air,  and  enthusiasm 
for aviation. I’ll tell you, it’s my kind of place. 

With that, I’m happy to answer any questions. 
Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MARION C. BLAKEY, ADMINISTRATOR,

FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION 

Good  Morning,  Chairman  Stevens  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  It  is  a  great 
pleasure to be here today in Alaska to testify, along with Secretary Mineta and Re-
gional  Administrator  Poe.  Improving  aviation  safety  and  lowering  accident  rates  in 
Alaska,  have  been  a  major  focus  of  efforts  by  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration 
(FAA) over the last decade, and I’m proud to acknowledge, also by the aviation com-
munity in Alaska. The aviation community here has demonstrated a strong commit-
ment to safety. After all, the aviation system is what connects Alaska’s cities, towns, 
villages,  businesses  and  families.  I  believe  we  in  the  FAA  have  a  good  news  story 
to  tell  about  improvements  in  aviation  safety  in  recent  years,  and  an  even  better 
story  to  tell  about  future  efforts  to  expand  and  build  upon  the  successes  already 
achieved. 

Today I would like to highlight a few areas of interest to the Committee: the Cap-
stone and Medallion programs, the growing use of weather cameras, particularly in 
remote  locations,  and  the  very  practical  benefits  of  the  Rural  Alaska  Lighting  pro-
gram. 

As  I’ve  often  said,  aviation  safety  will  always  be  the  first  priority  at  the  FAA. 
Every decision we make is with the safety of the flying public in mind. Let me begin 
this morning by describing how serious the FAA is in pursuing the goal of increased 
aviation safety in Alaska. When I first came to the FAA, we put in place a strategic 
business  plan—we  call  it  our  Flight  Plan—with  specific  objectives  and  performance 
targets.  The  FAA’s  Flight  Plan  for  2004–2008  lists  among  the  safety  objectives  for 
the next 5 years a specific objective, ‘‘Reduce Accidents in Alaska.’’ The stated strat-
egy is to expand and accelerate the implementation of safety and air navigation im-
provements  programs  here.  It  is  noteworthy  because  no  other  state  was  listed  indi-
vidually, only Alaska. Why, you might ask, does the FAA Flight Plan have a specific 
objective  of  improving  aviation  safety  in  Alaska?  The  answer  is  simple,  Alaska  has 
been  called  the  ‘‘flyingest  state  in  the  union.’’  It  is  a  place  where  schoolchildren 
board  aircraft  to  travel  to  school,  instead  of  a  bus.  When  someone  in  a  village  is 
ill and needs medical attention, they will most likely be transported to the hospital 
via  aircraft.  As  an  essential  mode  of  everyday  transportation,  aviation  must  be  a 
safe mode.

A  1999  study  by  the  National  Institute  on  Occupational  Safety  and  Health 
(NIOSH) ranked being a commercial airline pilot as the most hazardous occupation 
in  Alaska.  Clearly,  a  focused,  dedicated,  multifaceted,  approach  to  improving  avia-
tion  safety  in  Alaska  was  needed.  I  am  happy  to  say  the  approach  we  are  taking, 
one  that  represents  the  collective  efforts  of  aviators,  the  State  of  Alaska,  and  the 
FAA, is working. 

The  most  promising  initiative  with  potential  for  broad  application  to  a  range  of 
hazards, including terrain, other airborne traffic, and weather, is the Capstone dem-
onstration  program  in  the  Alaska  Region.  Capstone  is  a  technology-focused  safety 
program  in  Alaska  that  seeks  near  term  safety  and  efficiency  gains  in  aviation  by 
accelerating  implementation  and  use  of  modern  technology,  in  both  avionics  and 
ground  system  infrastructure.  The  key  enabling  technology  on  which  Capstone  is 
based  is  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance-Broadcast  (ADS–B).  ADS–B  gives  an 
aircraft with the requisite data uplink/downlink and cockpit display capabilities the 
same  information  about  other  aircraft  in  the  vicinity  as  air  traffic  control  now  re-
ceives.  Capstone  Phase  I,  which  began  in  1999,  included  the  installation  of  govern-
ment-furnished Global Positioning System (GPS) driven avionics suites in 200 com-
mercial  aircraft  serving  the  region  around  Bethel,  Alaska,  known  as  the  Yukon-
Kuskokwim  Delta  Region  (YK  Delta),  consisting  of  over  160,000  square  miles.  One 
of  the  two  approved  datalink  technologies  for  ADS–B,  the  Universal  Access  Trans-
ceiver (UAT) also provides an uplink for weather information via Flight Information 
Services-Broadcast  (FIS–B).  The  weather  data  is  displayed  on  the  same  multi-
function cockpit display used for the ADS–B display of traffic, and for terrain data. 
Through  2004  the  FAA  Alaskan  Region  Capstone  Program  has  achieved  signifi-
cant  safety  and  efficiency  results.  Capstone  equipped  aircraft  have  had  a  consist-
ently  lower  accident  rate  than  non-equipped  aircraft.  From  2000  through  2004,  the 
rate  of  accidents  for  Capstone-equipped  aircraft  dropped  significantly—by  47  per-
cent.  Also,  the  rate  of  accidents  for  Yukon-Kuskokwim  Delta  Region-based  air  car-
riers has been falling since 2001, and is now at the lowest rate since 1990. Histori-
cally,  the  rate  of  air  taxi  accidents  within  the  YK  Delta  has  been  2  to  4  times  the 
rest  of  Alaska,  but  in  2003  the  accident  rate  for  the  region  was  below  the  rest  of 
the state for the first time. That is real progress. 

Phase II of Capstone will expand the coverage to southeast Alaska, in the Juneau 
area,  and  Phase  III  contemplates  expanding  the  program  to  cover  the  entire  state. 
Also as part of Phase II, additional technology infrastructure will be deployed. New 
Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Procedure (RNP) arrival and de-
parture  procedures  will  continue  to  be  developed  for  the  airports  recommended  by 
the  industry  for  upgrade  to  Instrument  Flight  Rule  (IFR)  access.  RNAV  procedures 
provide  flight  path  guidance  incorporated  in  taxi  procedures,  with  minimal  instruc-
tions  required  during  departure  by  air  traffic  controllers.  RNP  is  on-board  tech-
nology  that  promises  to  add  to  capacity  by  allowing  pilots  to  fly  more  direct  point-
to-point  routes  reliably  and  accurately.  Key  benefits  of  RNAV  and  RNP  include 
more  efficient  use  of  airspace,  with  improved  flight  profiles,  resulting  in  significant 
fuel  efficiencies  to  the  airlines.  An  airport-to-airport  Global  Positioning  System 
(GPS)/Wide  Area  Augmentation  System  (WAAS)  based  route  structure  will  be 
mapped between all IFR airports. Aircraft avionics equipage is key to an accelerated 
implementation strategy; therefore Capstone will continue to pursue affordable avi-
onics so that aircraft owners will have a range of choices appropriate to their oper-
ational needs. This includes both creating options for equipage and a strategy to en-
sure that all aircraft in Alaska are equipped. 

In  addition  to  technology  improvements,  the  FAA  has  also  undertaken  safety 
management  and  training  efforts  in  partnership  with  the  aviation  community  here 
to  increase  safety  awareness  and  reduce  aircraft  accidents.  In  joint  efforts  with  the 
Medallion  Foundation,  a  non-profit  aviation  safety  organization  that  provides  man-
agement  resources,  training  and  support  to  the  Alaskan  aviation  community,  the 
FAA is funding a program known as the Five Star Shield program, which is an en-
hanced  safety  management  system.  The  Medallion  Five  Star  Shield  program  takes 
a business-like approach to safety, providing for the setting of goals as well as plan-
ning and measuring performance in specific areas through the use of system safety 
concepts.  The  program  is  voluntary,  and  focuses  on  establishing  and  sustaining  an 
elevated  level  of  safety  performance  through:  the  development  of  a  safety  culture 
that holds safety as a core value; continuous professional development of individual 
skills and competence; proactive sharing of operational control responsibilities; haz-
ard  identification  and  risk  management;  and  management  practices  that  support 
the organization’s safety objectives. 

The  Five  Stars  in  the  Medallion  Five  Star  Shield  program  include  numerous 
methods for improving safety. To earn the First Star, each air carrier must establish 
a safety program which, at a minimum, should include safety meetings and audits,

15

the  use  of  root-cause  analysis,  hazard  identification,  incident  investigations,  and  a 
viable  emergency  response  plan.  The  Five  Star  program  also  requires  a  classroom 
training  program  for  pilots,  mechanics  and  ground  service  personnel,  as  well  as  re-
quired  training  on  a  PC-based  computer  simulator.  Two  annual  check  rides  are  re-
quired  to  receive  this  second  Star,  and  annual  pilot  proficiency  check  rides  are  re-
quired  to  keep  the  Star.  The  Third  Star  involves  operational  risk  management.  A 
dynamic system that provides analytical tools as well as a system of checks and bal-
ances to proactively identify hazards and manage risks is required. The carrier must 
have  an  operational  risk  management  system  that  quantifies  the  risks  for  each 
flight,  including  weather,  airport,  and  crew  readiness.  The  total  risk  score  deter-
mines  if  the  flight  is  conducted  normally,  if  more  management  evaluation  is  re-
quired for release of the flight, or if the flight is cancelled. The Fourth Star concerns 
maintenance and ground service operations, requiring specific training and manning 
levels. The Fifth Star is an internal audit program, which requires incorporation of 
a  proactive  internal  audit  system  that  focuses  on  the  use  of  systems  safety  prin-
ciples, as well as regulatory compliance. This is a comprehensive audit program re-
quirement  intended  to  allow  the  operator  to  continuously  monitor  their  operating 
systems and provide for continuous improvement. Medallion has specific detailed re-
quirements. 

The  FAA  is  supporting  the  Medallion  Foundation  in  the  implementation  of  this 
program.  Once  an  applicant  has  received  all  five  Stars,  and  passed  an  independent 
audit, they may be certified for the Medallion Shield, which is attested to by a decal 
displayed  on  the  aircraft,  and  can  be  used  on  uniforms  and  promotional  materials. 
In  order  to  maintain  shield  status,  the  operator  must  successfully  pass  an  audit 
each year. If the operator fails to pass the audit, or Medallion on-site inspectors no-
tice  that  a  specific  activity  represented  by  a  star  is  not  being  properly  addressed 
on  a  continuing  basis,  the  star  and  shield  may  be  revoked.  A  direct  benefit  of  the 
Shield  program  for  operators  is  that  the  insurance  industry  has  agreed  to  provide 
favorable rates for Shield carriers. 

It’s  worth  noting  here  that  the  FAA  and  the  Medallion  Foundation  are  not  just 
focused  on  improving  safety  in  commercial  operations,  but  are  also  targeting  im-
provements  to  safety  in  the  general  aviation  (GA)  community  as  well.  Our  efforts 
in this area are coordinated through the Medallion Flyer General Aviation Program, 
which  is  proving  to  be  quite  popular  among  the  GA  community.  Interested  pilots 
begin  by  submitting  an  application  to  the  Medallion  Foundation,  which  will  then 
issue  the  pilot  a  free  copy  of  the  FAA  ‘‘Back  to  Basics—Runway  Safety’’  CD.  After 
that, the pilot is invited to attend the FLYER Step II course, which provides access 
to free usage of Medallion state-of-the-art flight training devices. During this course, 
pilots are provided with tools designed to help establish a personal safety program. 
They  are  also  introduced  to  hazard  assessment  and  risk  management  techniques. 
Pilots  also  receive  important  information  on  flying  in  ‘‘white  out’’  and  ‘‘flat’’  light 
conditions, risk assessment, pilot/ATC communications, and Alaska flying tips. 

The  Capstone  and  Medallion  programs  clearly  demonstrate  that  better  informa-
tion, better training, and better risk-management procedures can contribute signifi-
cantly to reductions in aviation accidents and save lives. People here in Alaska can 
be very proud of the progress they’ve made. Alaska has set an example for the rest 
of the country. 

The  on-going  and  increasing  deployment  of  weather  cameras  in  numerous  parts 
of Alaska is another beneficial use of technology that can dramatically improve avia-
tion safety by providing near real-time information to help with pilot decision mak-
ing and risk management. There are currently 55 operational locations for weather 
cameras, which stretch into every region of the state, and 12 more operational sites 
will be available in 2005. Many of these weather cameras are positioned in or near 
mountain  passes  and  other  geographical  features  which  are  often  used  by  pilots  to 
navigate  on  their  flights.  The  other  feature  of  these  cameras  that  is  so  beneficial 
to pilots is that they are often located at rural airports where there are no weather 
observers, and no other means to find out what current weather conditions are prior 
to  deciding  to  take  off.  They  are  also  co-located  with  automated  weather  systems, 
providing  additional  visual  information  previously  only  available  at  those  few  sites 
with a weather observer. 

These  cameras,  all  of  which  can  be  viewed  at  one  website,  http://
akweathercams.faa.gov ,  provide  two  images  from  each  camera  located  at  the  site. 
One  image  is  a  file  photo  of  the  area  within  the  camera’s  range  on  a  clear,  sunny 
day.  The  other  image  is  a  real-time  photo,  which  is  refreshed  every  10  minutes,  of 
the  exact  same  view  as  the  file  photo.  This  provides  an  instant  visual  comparison 
of weather conditions, precipitation, cloud cover, ceiling, and visibility. 

The  real  value  in  these  weather  cameras  is  that  they  help  pilots  decide  whether 
to  even  begin  their  flight,  based  on  weather  conditions,  rather  than  have  the  pilots

16

have to make difficult and hazardous decisions once they have encountered the dete-
riorating  weather  conditions  in  flight.  Flight  service  specialists  also  have  access  to 
the  weather  camera  images,  and  routinely  brief  pilots  on  the  weather  camera  im-
ages  when  they  call  for  a  pre-flight  briefing  and  during  their  flight,  providing  the 
most up-to-date information on the weather camera images to help pilots make that 
‘‘go  or  no-go’’  decision.  During  an  independent  study  conducted  between  December 
2002  and  March  2003  by  Parker  Associates,  Inc.,  68  percent  of  the  reported  deci-
sions made based on weather cameras were to cancel or delay a flight due to weath-
er. Air carriers, commercial operators, and general aviation pilots can avoid the cost 
of fuel from flights that must be diverted or repeated due to bad weather. Cameras 
have  a  positive  financial  impact  on  an  industry  undergoing  economic  challenges. 
Our  website  for  the  cameras  has  received  1.3  million  ‘‘hits’’  in  2003,  2.3  million 
‘‘hits’’  in  2004,  and  we  expect  the  number  of  ‘‘hits’’  to  increase  by  another  1  million 
this fiscal year—a real testament to how important real time knowledge of weather 
conditions is for pilots. 

Turning now to another area of interest to this Committee, I would like to briefly 
highlight  the  FAA’s  Rural  Alaska  Lighting  Program  (RALP).  The  goal  of  the  Rural 
Alaska  Lighting  Program  is  to  install  airport  lighting  in  communities  with  limited 
access  to  24-hour  medical  facilities,  to  provide  better  access  and  improved  lighting 
for  aeromedical  services.  The  Program  is  comprised  of  three  tiers.  Tier  One  is  Me-
dium  Intensity  Runway  Lighting  (MIRLs)  or  permanent  edge  lighting  at  those  air-
ports  that  meet  minimum  safety  requirements.  Tier  Two  is  portable,  battery-pow-
ered  lights  for  communities  or  airports  that  are  unable  to  accommodate  permanent 
edge  lights.  Tier  Three  is  Precision  Approach  Path  Indicator  (PAPI)  and  Runway 
End Identifier Lights (REILs) to support approach procedures at airports. 

This program began in 2001 with a study that identified 63 communities needing 
the  improved  lighting.  Federal  funding  began  in  FY02.  In  addition  to  the  $35  mil-
lion that has been appropriated for this effort so far under the FAA’s Facilities and 
Equipment  program,  the  Airport  Improvement  Program  has  provided  the  funding 
for  necessary  runway  pavement  or  runway  safety  area  improvements.  All  of  the  63 
communities  have  received  at  least  an  interim  solution  to  provide  for  24  hour  VFR 
aeromedical access. Twenty-six of the 63 communities have also received permanent 
lighting solutions. An additional 19 communities will have permanent lighting solu-
tions  by  2010.  The  final  18  communities  have  complicated  land  and/or  environ-
mental  issues,  but  we  will  continue  to  work  with  the  State  of  Alaska  to  resolve  all 
outstanding issues. 

Finally,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  take  a  moment  to  mention  the  great  contribu-
tions  to  aviation  safety  in  Alaska  made  by  a  true  visionary,  Tom  Wardleigh.  Mr. 
Wardleigh  shared  his  vision  for  the  future  of  aviation  in  Alaska  with  you  and  all 
Alaskan  aviators  in  testimony  to  this  body  in  1999.  That  vision  is  now  part  of  Mr. 
Wardleigh’s legacy. The FAA is pleased to announce the creation of a new National 
safety  award  in  honor  of  the  late  Thomas  Wardleigh,  Master  Pilot,  Master  Me-
chanic,  elder  statesman  of  aviation.  As  with  so  many  of  this  region’s  innovations, 
Mr.  Wardleigh’s  contribution  to  aviation  safety  is  now  a  national  asset.  Tom  urged 
the  FAA  to  strive  for  exceptional  customer  service  and  to  be  a  proving  ground  for 
new  ideas.  He  was  a  visionary  who  knew  that  if  we  could  make  an  idea  work  in 
Alaska with all of its challenges, it would benefit all of aviation. 

Mr. Wardleigh’s wife, Jan, is with us today. I hope she is pleased with our memo-
rial to him. I know that this award has special meaning for you, Mr. Chairman, as 
I have been told that you received your floatplane rating from Tom just a few years 
ago. 

In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, let me reiterate what I said at the outset of my tes-
timony  today—aviation  safety  is,  and  always  will  be,  the  first  priority  at  the  FAA. 
These programs I have discussed are the leading edge of efforts to improve aviation 
safety  for  everyone,  and  Alaska  is  once  again  showing  the  way.  Thank  you,  Mr. 
Chairman,  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  such  an  important  topic.  I  would 
be happy to answer any questions you may have.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Blakey. 
Mr.  Secretary,  we  seem  to  be  going  through  a  transition  here 
now.  We’ve  traditionally  had  the  hub-and-spoke  type  of  transpor-
tation  for  local  aviation,  commercial  aviation,  that  was  the  same, 
you  know,  throughout  the  Nation  for  a  while.  Their  hubs  and  the 
major airlines flew in those hubs and out of them on a slope basis. 
That seems to be changing in our state, and I don’t know if you’ve 
noticed  it  nationally,  but  as  we  go  to  this  new  phase  now,  as  you

mentioned  bypass  mail,  we’re  going  to  have  more  direct  flights 
from Anchorage to the destination that used to go through the hub 
and then on to the destination. But the larger cargo planes, they’re 
going to go straight in. That, I think may increase the demand for 
Essential Air Service, as you review it. 

Clearly,  that  is  the  essential  thing  for  us  to  maintain  the  seats 
as well as get the mail to the small villages, small communities for 
our state. But I would urge you as you go into the review of Essen-
tial  Air  Service,  and  I  think  it  does  need  review.  We  look  forward 
to  working  with  you  on  it,  our  Committee.  But  I  urge  you  to  look 
at the changes here in our state before you make final decisions on 
EAS. Has anyone brought this change to your attention? 

Mr.  MINETA.  Absolutely.  There’s  no  question  that  the  hub-and-
spoke  system  and  the  embedded  costs  that  it  produces  for  the  air-
lines is something that they’re shifting, and there’s a change in the 
paradigm  of  the  hub-and-spoke  to  more  point-to-point.  And,  as 
you’ve  indicated,  as  we  go  more  to  point-to-point,  there  will  be  in-
creased use of the Essential Air Service. And I think that’s part of 
the  picture  that  we’re  looking  at  in  the  Lower  48  as  it—as  the  in-
crease  occurs,  the  question  about  given  the  limited  financial  re-
sources  and  how  do  we  make  sure  that  we  spread  it  out  as  evenly 
and  as  efficiently  and  as  fairly  as  possible.  And  that’s  where  we 
would  do  the  consultation  with  you  and  the  Committee  to  see 
where we go in the future. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for that. And I appreciate your state-

ment. 

One  question  came  to  my  mind.  On  these  Open  Skies  negotia-

tions, do you negotiate cargo-only flights? 

Mr.  MINETA.  No,  these  are  all  both  inclusive  of  passenger  and 
cargo. There are some places like in—it was in Indonesia when we 
did  the  Open  Skies  Agreement,  we  started  with  cargo,  and  then 
phased in the passenger piece of it. And so the passenger piece will 
kick in in 2006. But we started out with the cargo only. 

So,  it  can  vary  from  each  country,  but  generally,  what  we’d  like 
to  get  to  eventually,  is  Open  Skies  for  both  cargo  and  passenger, 
and—but  we  will  phase  it  in  depending  on  the  negotiations  with 
the—with that country. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Ms.  Blakey,  I’m  glad  you  mentioned  Tom 
Wardleigh.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  on  this  national 
award  that  will  recognize  anyone  in  the  country  that  is  worthy  of 
honoring  for  contributions  to  aircraft,  airline,  and  airway  safety. 
He  was  not  only  a  great  person,  he  was  really  the  original  person 
to  suggest  the  Medallion  program.  But  he  also  was  great  fun  and 
my flight instructor. So I miss him very much. 

I do thank you both. I’ve got a series of witnesses. I look forward 

to working with you while you’re here. 

I think the very fact that you’re here will give you an opportunity 
to witness even further some of the things we’re doing, both Medal-
lion  and  Capstone.  I  actually  flew  a  few  years  ago  Christmas,  one 
of  the  first  flights  into  the  Bethel  region  testing  Capstone  and  it 
was  just  a  wonderful  flight.  And  I’ve  seen  it  improve  since  then.  I 
wish  I’ve  had  more  time  to  fly.  I  think  other  people  around  here 
can  have  a  great  opportunity  to  really  fly  in  safety  and  that  is  a 
wonderful thing.

to Alaska. 

I  do  thank  you  also  for  the  cameras.  I  personally  have  used  the 
cameras.  I  think  the  public  ones  most  used  is  the  one  which  runs 
through  the  pass  in  Lake  Clark  and  from  time  to  time  I  may  get 
calls that they may not be functioning properly. I’m pleased to say 
Mr. Poe responds and makes it function. 

I’m  happy  to  have  you  here  today.  And  thank  you  from  coming 

Mr. MINETA. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  I  have  to  say,  Norm,  I’ve  visited  Norm  Mineta 
Airport.  I  always  thought  you  had  to  be  dead  to  have  an  airport 
named after you. 

[Laughter.] 
The CHAIRMAN. I’m glad the two of us are still here. 
The next panel is Pat Poe, the regional administrator of the FAA, 
the  Alaska  region;  Mike  Barton,  the  commissioner  of  the  Alaska 
Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. 

I  note  for  the  record  that  the  Lieutenant  Governor  is  here,  Mr. 

Loren Leman. Nice to see you here. 

Mr. Poe, in view of the fact that Ms. Blakey has already testified, 

do you have an opening statement? 

STATEMENT OF PAT POE, REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR, 
FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, ALASKA REGION 

Mr. POE. I don’t have an opening statement. But I do have words 
I’d like to share with the Chairman and the guests here, if I might. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Mr.  POE.  First,  I’d  like  to  offer  a  recall,  Mr.  Chairman  it  was  in 
1999  I  first  arrived  and  had  the  privilege  to  testify  before  you  and 
others  at  a  hearing  similar  to  this.  And  that  was  a  long  hearing. 
That lasted several hours, many people testified, all on aviation. 

At the conclusion of that, you offered comments to the effect that 
it  was  the  first  time  perhaps  you  had  ever  seen  government  and 
industry  actually  working  together.  And  if  that  proved  to  be  true, 
perhaps that would make the difference in terms of aviation safety. 
What  I  would  like  to  report  is  what  has  happened  since  then, 

and what differences have been made and measured. 

First,  I  would  say  that  I  came  to  Alaska,  like  many  people,  I 
think,  for  the  adventure;  but  you  stay  because  of  the  people.  You 
stay  because  of  the  dedication  to  aviation  and  the  fact  that  it’s 
truly  the  conduit  through  which  commerce  moves,  education, 
medevac, and the transportation system as a whole. 

The  second  thing  I  learned  here  was  that  all  of  the  pilots  are 
both  progressive  and  aggressive.  I  mean,  I’ve  never  met  a  bashful 
pilot  yet  in  Alaska,  you  don’t  have  to  ask  for  their  opinions,  be-
cause  you’re  going  to  get  them  anyway.  And  that  has  served  me 
very well. 

And  last,  I  would  say  Alaskans  expect  results  and  they  want  it 

to be measured, and that is what we have done. 

The  Capstone  program,  arguably,  is  one  of  the  most  measured 
programs  of  recent  times.  The  evaluations  began  before  the  first 
aircraft  was  ever  equipped.  To  date,  we  have  three  studies  that 
have  been  done:  the  University  of  Alaska  in  cooperation  with  the 
Mitre Corporation; and most recently Embry-Riddle University, has 
produced studies from the inception through April of 2005.

Capstone  Phase  I  represents  now  over  a  million  flight  hours. 
Very  strong  data  upon  which  to  make  findings,  and  as  Adminis-
trator  Blakey  pointed  out,  the  differential  between  accidents  in 
Capstone-equipped  versus  non-Capstone-equipped  airplanes,  47 
percent. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  We’d  like  to  have  copies  of  that  for  the  record 
and perhaps we’ll take the summaries and make them part of this 
hearing record. * 

Mr. POE. I would be delighted, sir. They’re here for your use. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
Mr.  POE.  Second,  I  would  like  to  mention,  just  briefly,  the  flight 
following  the  aspect  of  Capstone.  This  is  the  ability  to  track  Cap-
stone-equipped  airplanes  with  1-second  updates  with  precise  accu-
racy.  That  has  a  variety  of  efficiencies  for  the  carriers  themselves, 
for  the  passengers,  for  the  movement  of  goods  and  services.  But 
also in search and rescue it has an enormous impact. 

Two  years  ago  in  Marshall,  Alaska,  night  flight,  one  soul  on 
board,  didn’t  arrive  at  the  destination,  middle  of  winter.  No  emer-
gency  locator  transmission  from  the  aircraft.  Aircraft  had  crashed. 
Practically no way to find it. 

The  center  here  in  Anchorage  ran  back  the  tape  using  the  tech-
nology  that  the  Administrator  mentioned,  automatic  dependent 
surveillance  broadcast,  and  pinpointed  the  accurate  location  of  the 
airplane.  I’ve  actually  met  the  pilot,  the  one  that  made  the  flight. 
Flew to that coordinate, put on night-vision goggles, and in 3 min-
utes spotted the airplane; pilot inside with two broken legs. That’s 
a life saved. Every life saved, according to OMB, has a measure of 
$3 million. I don’t think any of us like to think in those terms, but 
when  you  look  at  programs  like  Capstone,  weather  cameras,  rural 
lighting  projects,  Medallion,  Circle  of  Safety,  the  list  is  long,  I’m 
pleased that it’s long. These programs all work together in their so-
lution. The safety record is truly extraordinary. 

Internationally, I recall the first International Advanced Aviation 
Technology  Conference  that  we  had  here  in  Anchorage,  hosted  by 
the Alaska Aviation Coordination Council, the University of Alaska 
in  Anchorage,  and  the  FAA.  And  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  were  kind 
enough to come and speak at that conference. 

Since  then,  we  have  had  an  additional  conference,  we’ve  had 
multiple  visitors  from  many,  many  different  countries.  Most  re-
cently, the World Bank was here. They’re looking at what we have 
done  in  Alaska  to  solve  similar  needs  in  the  countries  around  the 
world. 

I  found  it  interesting  and  rewarding  that  Australia  has  an-
nounced that they will start using ADSB for air traffic surveillance 
and  separation.  They’ve  acknowledged  they’re  the  second  country 
in the world to do that. The first being the United States of Amer-
ica,  right  here  at  our  center  in  Anchorage,  on  January  1,  2001, 
gives  you  an  idea  how  far  into  the  future  we’ve  traveled  together. 
Recently, Congress urged the FAA to look at the weather camera 
issues in the mountain passes. You’ve mentioned Lake Clark Pass, 
one of our most popular and most necessary locations. I am pleased 
to  announce  that  by  this  time  next  year  we  expect  to  have  Ptar-

migan  and  Rainy  Pass  cameras  installed,  and  by  the  end  of  that 
year,  operational.  Merrill  Pass,  the  following  year.  As  you  know, 
these are some of the most terrain-challenged corridors for aviation 
in Alaska; and accordingly, they have attending risk. 

I  think  perhaps,  in  summary,  I  would  say  that  Alaska,  I  think, 
has  chosen  to  make  a  difference  for  itself,  and  I  think  the  commu-
nity has worked together. The State of Alaska, the air carriers and 
operators  in  the  audience,  the  University  of  Alaska,  the  industry, 
and the FAA have all been working together toward a common re-
sult. 

At  the  outset,  when  you  said  perhaps  working  together  could 
make  a  difference,  the  Administrator  has  mentioned  some  of  the 
remarkable gains in safety. I would just like to highlight one thing, 
if I might. 

During the decade of the 1990s based on NTSB, National Trans-
portation  Safety  Board  statistics,  we  were  averaging  about  180  ac-
cidents  a  year  in  Alaska.  Year  before  last,  we  had  117  accidents. 
Last year 100. Those are remarkable gains. And the effort that will 
be necessary to sustain them is the same effort that got us this far, 
and  that  is,  if  we  all  work  together,  we’ll  continue  to  make  im-
provements. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Thank  you  very  much.  I’ve  got  some  questions, 

but let’s hear first from Commissioner Barton. 

STATEMENT OF MIKE BARTON, COMMISSIONER, ALASKA 

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC FACILITIES 
Mr.  BARTON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  And  I  want  to  thank 
you for your personal support of aviation in Alaska over the years. 
It’s made a difference. 

I  will  confine  my  remarks  primarily  to  those  issues  that  impact 
our  rural  communities  and  the  256  rural  airports  that  the  state 
owns and operates. 

Mr.  Plumb  will  address  issues  relating  to  the  two  international 

airports operated by the state. 

I want to start by expressing our thanks to the FAA for its ongo-

ing cooperative relationships with the state over the years. 

The Essential Air Service Program remains a critical support for 
safe  scheduled  service  with  34  Alaskan  communities  out  of  a  total 
of 216 that are eligible. In some cases, that service is made possible 
by  this  program  as  the  only  way  that  many  Alaskans  can  get  the 
medical help and other vital services that they need. 

The  state  has  a  strategic  goal  to  improve  runways  at  24-hour 
VFR  standard  in  communities  that  depend  on  air  medical  evacu-
ation.  A  1999  Congressional  study  identified  63  communities  that 
did not have this capability. That list is our target. 

Runway edge lights and identifier lights and precision-path indi-
cators  when  installed  on  a  3,300-foot  runway  allow  24-hour  VFR 
access. 

Congress  has  made  special  appropriations  of  $38  million  for  this 
program.  And  with  these  special  appropriations,  we’ve  temporarily 
improved medical access by deploying portable emergency lights for 
helicopter landing zones at all 63 communities. And since 1999, we 

VerDate 0ct 09 2002  13:33 Nov 09, 2005 Jkt 023709 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\WPSHR\GPO\DOCS\23709.TXT JACK PsN: JACKF

21

have improved 26 of the 63 airports to 24-hour standards, and will 
complete another 14 by the end of 2008. 

Realistically,  the  entire  list  of  63  communities  should  have  24-
hour  medical  access  by  2015.  The  continuing  support  of  the  Con-
gress and yourself is greatly appreciated. 

The  FAA  and  all  of  those  in  the  aviation  community  in  Alaska 
should  be  commended  for  their  efforts  in  aviation  safety.  The  re-
duction in incidents and accidents that have been achieved in Alas-
ka  is  remarkable,  and  the  Capstone  program  has  contributed  sig-
nificantly  to  this  reduction.  You’ve  heard  a  lot  about  this  program 
and will hear more, but please know that the State of Alaska fully 
supports an accelerated implementation of Capstone. 

And  further,  the  Medallion  program  has  made  significant  con-

tributions to aviation safety. 

Although  we  are  blessed  with  natural  bounty,  we  never  like  to 
see  migratory  birds  on  our  airports.  In  fact,  we’ve  spent  an  inordi-
nate  amount  of  time  and  money  managing  this  federal  resource  at 
our certified airports. Ironically, we dedicate State resources to hire 
federal employees to keep federal birds off state airports. 

[Laughter.] 
Mr. BARTON. We clearly support more federal participation in the 

management of those federal resources. 

The  application  of  a  National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  as  well 
as  Section  4(f)  of  the  Department  of  Transportation  Act  of  1966, 
needs  to  be  clarified.  At  some  point  in  time,  a  decision  is  made  to 
designate a piece of ground as an airport. It seems that designation 
identifies  the  dominant  use  and  clearly  specifies  the  objective  for 
a  designated  piece  of  land.  I’m  not  advocating  running  roughshod 
over  the  environment  as  these  airports  are  developed.  I  am  advo-
cating common-sense application of NEPA, 4(f), and other environ-
mental  laws  for  lands  that  have  long  been  designated  for  airport 
purposes. 

With  the  help  of  Congress  and  FAA,  the  AIP  program  for  state-
owned and operated airports in Alaska has grown from $61 million 
to $205 million in the last 5 years. 

Alaska  has  benefited  tremendously  from  the  AIP  program,  and 
we  are  grateful,  particularly  in  our  rural  communities  where  our 
airports  are  our  highways.  That’s  not  to  say  that  we  don’t  have 
unmet  needs.  The  cost  of  construction  in  rural  Alaska  is  very  ex-
pensive.  At  most  locations  in  rural  Alaska,  the  materials  and 
equipment needed must be barged in from hundreds of miles away 
during a very short summer construction season. 

We  could  easily  double  our  AIP  investment  and  still  find  our-
selves  behind.  I  urge  Congress  to  more  fully  fund  FAA  operations 
from  sources  other  than  the  trust  fund  so  that  more  of  the  trust 
fund can be invested in airport improvements. 

In closing, I want to emphasize how important air travel and the 
infrastructure  that  supports  aviation  is  to  Alaska.  From  our  inter-
national  airports  on  down  to  the  smallest  village  strip,  our  airport 
system  is  simply  crucial  to  the  state’s  economy,  local  economies, 
and the health and well being of all Alaskans. 

Alaska  comprises  20  percent  of  the  land  mass  of  the  United 
States,  but  has  less  road  mileage  than  Fairfax  County,  Virginia.

Our  air  transportation  infrastructure  is  the  glue  that  holds  our 
communities together. 

Alaskans  appreciate  the  continuing  support  of  the  Congress  for 
aviation and the recognition of the importance of aviation to Alaska 
is gratifying as well. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Barton follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MIKE BARTON, COMMISSIONER, ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF 

TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC FACILITIES 

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  We  in  Alaska  appreciate  that  you  have  convened  this 
field  hearing  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  many  issues  unique  to  Alaska 
aviation. 

I will confine my remarks primarily to those issues that impact our rural commu-

nities and the 256 rural airports that the state owns and operates. 

I  would  start  by  expressing  our  thanks  to  the  FAA  for  its  ongoing,  cooperative 
relationship  with  the  state  over  the  years.  We  have  found  that  our  agencies  share 
a  common  mission  of  providing  the  infrastructure  for  air  transportation  in  a  very 
large,  difficult,  and  often  inhospitable  area.  The  willingness  of  the  staff  at  FAA  to 
face  these  challenges  together  with  their  state  counterparts  continues  to  produce 
mutual benefits. 
Essential Air Service 

This government program remains a critical support for safe, scheduled passenger 
service  to  34  Alaska  communities,  out  of  a  total  of  216  communities  that  are  eligi-
ble.  In  some  cases,  the  service  made  possible  by  this  program  is  the  only  way  that 
many  Alaskans  can  get  the  medical  help  and  other  vital  services  that  they  need. 
The state, in developing our comments on each subsidy offer, gives careful consid-
eration  to  the  efficacy  of  the  route  subsidized,  the  carriers  competing,  and  the  im-
pact to the community, all with an eye towards funding the most effective program. 
Runway Lighting 

The  state  has  a  strategic  goal  to  improve  runways  to  a  24-hour  VFR  standard  in 
communities  that  depend  on  air  medical  evacuation.  A  Congressional  study  con-
ducted in 1999 identified 63 communities that did not have 24-hour VFR capability. 
That  list  is  our  target.  Runway  edge  lights,  end  identifier  lights,  and  precision  ap-
proach  path  indicators,  when  installed  on  a  3,300-foot  runway,  allow  24-hour  VFR 
access. 

Congress  has  also  made  special  appropriations  of  $38  million  to  the  FAA  for  this 
program. We have worked cooperatively with the FAA to apply these monies to the 
communities  on  the  list  of  deficient  airports  to  install  lighting  and  navigation  sys-
tems. 

With the special appropriations, we have temporarily improved medical access by 
deploying  portable  emergency  lights  for  helicopter  landing  zones  at  all  63  commu-
nities.  These  lights  facilitate  safer  evacuation  by  Coast  Guard  and  National  Guard 
helicopters  in  life  and  death  situations.  A  few  civilian  operators  have  also  become 
certified to use these portable lights. 

Since 1999 we have improved 26 of the 63 airports to 24-hour standards, and will 
complete another 14 by the end of 2008. Twenty-three more communities will await 
a permanent solution. There is a plan in place for them. Realistically, the entire list 
of 63 communities should have 24-hour medical access by 2015. At that time, more 
than  $500  million  will  have  been  invested  in  these  communities,  including  the  $38 
million  and  more  than  $470  million  we  are  dedicating  from  the  AIP  program  to 
bring those airports up to required standards. 

The continuing support of Congress is greatly appreciated. 

Safety 

The  FAA  and  all  of  those  in  the  aviation  community  in  Alaska  should  be  com-
mended for their efforts in aviation safety. The reduction in incidents/accidents that 
has been achieved in Alaska is remarkable. The Capstone program has contributed 
to  this  reduction,  as  well  a  achieving  a  large  improvement  in  access  for  aviation  in 
Alaska.  This  improved  access  results  from  the  fact  that  better  weather  reporting 
means a better IFR success rate, and therefore more completed flights. Enough has 
been  or  will  be  said  about  this  program,  but  please  know  that  the  State  of  Alaska 
fully  supports  an  accelerated  transition  to  a  new  national  airspace  system  using 
space-based navigational aids.

Also, the Medallion program has made a significant contribution to aviation safe-
ty.  You  will  hear  much  about  the  good  this  program  has  done,  but  simply  stated, 
since many state employees fly to all corners of the state, we all look for the Medal-
lion logo on each airplane we board. 
Wildlife Management 

Although we are blessed with natural bounty, we never like to see migratory birds 
on  our  airports.  In  fact,  we  spend  an  inordinate  amount  of  time  and  money  man-
aging this federal resource at our certified airports. Ironically, we dedicate state re-
sources to hire federal employees (USDA) to keep federal birds off state airports. Re-
cent  interpretation  of  the  Migratory  Bird  Act  of  1918  requires  that  we  cease  con-
struction  activities  if  birds  are  found  to  be  nesting  on  the  airports.  This  creates 
undue  hardships,  delays,  and  increased  costs  during  our  abbreviated  summer  con-
struction season. 

We clearly support more federal participation in the management of those federal 

resources. 
Wetlands 

The  application  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  as  well  as  section  4(f) 
of  the  Department  of  Transportation  Act  of  1966  (49  U.S.C.  303(c)),  to  all  airports, 
including rural airports, needs to be clarified. At some point in time a decision was 
made to designate a piece of ground as an airport. It seems that designation identi-
fies  the  dominant  use,  and  clearly  specifies  the  objective  for  the  designated  land. 
I  am  not  advocating  running  roughshod  over  the  environment  as  these  airports 
are  developed.  I  am  advocating  common  sense  application  of  NEPA,  Sec.  4(f),  and 
other  environmental  laws  to  lands  that  have  been  long  designated  for  airport  pur-
poses. A great deal of time and money is spent on living up to the letter of the law. 
Stringent  application  of  these  laws  results  in  added  cost  and  protracted  delays  in 
needed projects. Recognition of the primary purpose of lands designated as airports 
should  be  incorporated  into  the  implementation  of  environmental  laws  at  airports. 
We believe that the small footprints of disturbance from our rural airport construc-
tion  should  allow  us  to  conduct  environmental  analyses,  rather  than  a  full  NEPA 
statement. 
AIP Program 

With the help of Congress and FAA, the AIP program has grown from $61 million 
to $205 million in the last 5 years. Alaska has benefited tremendously from the AIP 
program,  particularly  in  our  rural  communities,  where  airports  are  our  highways, 
and we are grateful. 

This  is  not  to  say  that  we  don’t  have  unmet  needs.  The  cost  of  construction  in 
rural  Alaska  is  expensive.  At  most  locations,  the  materials  and  equipment  needed 
to  construct  an  airport  must  be  barged  in  from  hundreds  of  miles  away  during  a 
very short summer construction season. As communities grow and everyone focuses 
on  improved  levels  of  service  such  as  those  identified  in  the  1999  medical  access 
study, we could easily double our AIP spending and still find ourselves behind. 

I  urge  Congress  to  more  fully  fund  FAA  operations  from  sources  other  than  the 
trust fund, so that more of the trust fund can be invested in airport improvements. 
I suggest, too, that the primary passenger entitlement formula be reviewed and pos-
sibly modified. In this fiscal year, Alaska’s rural primary airports will earn $29 mil-
lion  in  passenger  entitlements.  Our  identified  needs  list  for  primary  airports  totals 
$535 million. 
TSA 

We  in  Alaska  are  as  concerned  about  transportation  security  as  any  state  in  the 
nation. We fully support the efforts to protect the traveler and our nation’s security. 
We have many transportation assets, such as the oil pipeline and terminal, the Port 
of  Anchorage,  the  oil  fields,  and  others,  the  loss  or  disruption  of  which  would  be  a 
severe blow to our state and the country. 

As it is currently structured, the TSA has three separate organizations in Alaska. 
We  believe  that  the  three  organizations  could  be  streamlined  into  one  to  provide 
consistent security oversight within Alaska. 

We  believe,  also,  that  at  Alaska’s  rural  airports,  transportation  security  can  be 
achieved  in  a  more  efficient  manner  than  at  present.  Transportation  security  pro-
grams at these airports should be based on threat analysis. 

As transportation security is presently implemented at Alaska’s rural airports, of-
tentimes  the  number  of  TSA  employees  outnumbers  other  airport  employees.  If  a 
threat-based  approach  were  used,  security  interests  in  Alaska  could  be  met  with 
considerably less investment.

Closing 

24

In  closing,  I  want  to  emphasize  how  important  air  travel,  and  the  infrastructure 

that supports aviation, is to Alaska. 

From our international airports on down to the smallest village strip, our airport 
system is simply crucial to the state’s economy, local economies, and the health and 
well being of all Alaskans. 

Across the far reaches of Alaska, our air transportation infrastructure has become 

the glue that holds our communities together. 

Alaskans appreciate the continuing support of the FAA and the Congress for avia-
tion in Alaska. This recognition of the importance of aviation to Alaska is gratifying 
to all of us. 

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  today,  and  will  answer  any  questions  the  mem-

bers may have for me.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. As you were talking, it re-
minds of a comment that I made—I think that GPS made more dif-
ference to our aviation than any other technology. Would you agree 
with that? 

Mr. BARTON. It certainly has made a tremendous difference. 
The CHAIRMAN. And Capstone is tied right into that, isn’t it? 
Mr. BARTON. Yes, it is. 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Can  you  tell  me—our  Committee  is  also  review-
ing  the  whole  communications  pattern  now.  We’re  going  into 
broadband, wireless, and so many new communication technologies. 
Are  any  of  them  going  to  affect  the  concept  of  our  airways  control 
or things like that, Capstone? 

Mr.  BARTON.  I  think  Mr.  Poe  is  more  qualified  to  answer  that. 
Mr.  POE.  The  answer  is  yes.  When  the  technology  is  affordable 
and  available.  By  that  I  mean,  for  instance,  in  Capstone  we’ve  al-
ready demonstrated that we can take a Capstone-equipped aircraft, 
fly  outside  of  any  ground-based  navigation  aid,  and  using  the  sys-
tem  at  hand  which  was  General  Dynamics  Iridium  and  go  directly 
from  the  aircraft  to  the  satellite,  down  into  our  center.  Which 
means,  in  effect,  we  can  track  and  provide  air  traffic  services  any-
where  in  Alaska  without  additional  ground  structure.  We,  being 
Capstone  and  the  FAA,  have  invested  money  and  are  looking  at 
this, and doing the research on it. 

At  this  point,  it’s  not  mature  and  robust  enough  to  support  that 

I understand that the Department of Defense is also doing some 
work  in  that  regard,  and  we  would  hope  that  their  successes  can 
be passed on to us. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  You  mentioned  Capstone  in  terms  of  the  second 
and  third  phase.  Do  you  have  a  plan  that  you’re  going  to  attempt 
to take it national? 

Mr. POE. We have a plan that is beyond the concept. In fact, we 
have  concept  options,  and  we’re  working  diligently  right  now  with 
the  Mitre  Corporation  supporting  us.  We’ve  had  extensive  input 
from  the  aviation  community  and  interests  and  industry  here.  By 
this  September,  it  is  our  intent—ours  being  the  FAA  Alaskan  re-
gion—to  make  a  presentation  of  our  proposals  and  alternatives  to 
the  senior  management  of  the  FAA  in  Washington,  DC.  Their  ad-
vice and influence will help shape what that plan is. 

The  Phase  II  plan,  which  is  being  implemented  in  Southeast, 
takes  advantage  of  the  Wide  Area  Augmentation  System.  And  the 
day that became active, we opened up air space in Southeast Alas-
ka,  41,000  feet  along  1,500  miles  of  air  route,  where  for  the  first 

application.

time we were no longer held, if you will, hostage to ground naviga-
tion  aids.  That  is  the  precursor  of  the  transition,  sir,  from  ground 
base to satellite technologies in air traffic services. 

The CHAIRMAN. The system was partially modified in Alaska and 

adapted in test phase; is that true? 

Mr. POE. This system being——
The CHAIRMAN. The Capstone? 
Mr.  POE.  Alaska  Airlines—if  you’re  referring  to  Alaska  Airlines? 
Alaska  Airlines  predated  Capstone  in  using  something  called 
RNP,  which  is  Required  Navigation  Procedures.  And  a  special  ap-
proach  down  Gastineau  Channel  into  Juneau,  Alaska.  RNP  was 
groundbreaking in aviation. That doesn’t sound like the right term 
in aviation, but it certainly opened up the rest of the world for that 
application,  and  RNP  is  one  of  the  technologies  and  approaches 
that’s  being  used  by  Alaska  Airlines  in  other  places  in  the  Lower 
48, and it’s one that we, the FAA, are promoting nationwide. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Barton, have you discussed with the Depart-
ment  of  Transportation  and  the  FAA  the  impact  of  this  require-
ment  of  10  percent  match  from  villages  for  Essential  Air  Service? 
Mr.  BARTON.  We  have  not  yet,  Mr.  Chairman.  We’re  watching 

that very carefully and intend to enter into that dialogue. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Knowing  some  of  them  as  I  do,  I  think  some  of 
them  can’t  make  that  payment.  I  would  wonder  if  we  could  work 
out  some  concept  of  more  broader  application  so  that  more  than 
one  village  would  contribute  something  for  that—at  least  have 
some  way  that  there’s  a  pool  of  money  to  meet  the  requirements 
for  an  Alaska  match  without  really  imposing  on  some  villages  a 
match that I don’t think they can make. 

Mr.  BARTON.  There  is  no  question  that  a  number  of  the  villages 
have a great deal of difficulty meeting that match requirement. We 
will have to work something out along those lines. 

The CHAIRMAN. Are there any other systems being tested now in 

the Alaska region that we have not discussed here today? 

Mr.  POE.  Yes,  sir.  We’ve  recently  completed  a  test  in  Fairbanks, 
Alaska using laser technology to hold short lines to prevent runway 
incursions.  That  product  was  available  through  the  Galaxy  Cor-
poration.  Under  a  licensed  to  Greatland  Laser  from  Alaska.  And 
the results of that evaluation are just now becoming available. 

The evaluation was done by our technical center in Atlantic City, 
New Jersey. The results to date do not appear to justify the deploy-
ment  of  that  technology  for  hold  short  lines  and  things  of  that  na-
ture. 

The areas of improvement have been documented, and that eval-

uation is ongoing, and we’re working with the manufacturer. 

The CHAIRMAN. Does that technology have any application to the 

rural villages where the needs for lighting is just imminent? 

Mr. POE. The—I think as it becomes more—if I can use the term, 
mature  and  robust,  in  that  it  moves  from  R&D  into  a  certified 
state, I think that technology would have a place in the inventory. 
And  by  ‘‘the  inventory,’’  I  mean  the  things  that  sponsors,  such  as 
the State of Alaska, could use in an AIP grant proposal. 
Right now these remain early days for that technology. 
The  only  other  thing  I  might  mention,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  that 
there are different types of community outreach programs that are

going on right now. I think many are the first in Alaska. The Circle 
of Safety, which is a consumer awareness and safety advocacy pro-
gram.  And  most  recently,  an  outreach  into  the  general  aviation 
community to address and focus upon those things general aviation 
pilots can do for themselves to the betterment of their safety record 
and to the benefit of their families. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you both for your testimony. 
Mike,  I’m  constrained  to  ask,  how  can  you  tell  a  Federal  bird 

from an Alaska bird? 

[Laughter.] 
Mr.  BARTON.  It’s  one  that’s  subject  to  the  Migratory  Bird  Treaty 

Act. That’s the best way. 

The CHAIRMAN. You made a good suggestion. We will take a look 

at that. 

Thank you both very much. 
Our  last  panel  is  the  panel  of  Morton  V.  Plumb,  the  Director  of 
Anchorage  International  Airport;  Rick  Thompson,  Alaska  Region, 
Vice  President  of  the  National  Air  Traffic  Controllers  Association; 
Jerry  Dennis,  the  Executive  Director  of  the  Medallion  Foundation; 
Richard Harding, PenAir; and Karen Casanovas, executive director 
of the Alaska Air Carriers Association. 

I don’t know if you can all find a seat there. I’d like to see if we 
can just have your comments, and then see if there’s any questions 
that I should put to you before we finish. 

Dick, I know that George has pointed out to me in the paper yes-

terday that you announced your 40th anniversary.

STATEMENT OF MORTON V. PLUMB, DIRECTOR, ANCHORAGE 

INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 

Mr.  PLUMB.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  the 
Committee.  My  name  is  Mort  Plumb,  and  I’m  the  director  of  the 
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. 

I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  you  today  about  our 

Since  the  beginning  of  air  field  operations  more  than  50  years 
ago,  Anchorage  International  has  grown  into  the  No.  1  airport—
cargo airport based on landed gross weight, and fourth ranking air-
port  in  the  world  based  on  cargo  tonnage.  We  expect  Anchorage’s 
air  cargo  operations  to  continue  the  growth  based  on  Asia-U.S. 
trade, and new federal legislation authorizing liberalization for for-
eign  and  domestic  air  carriers  who  use  Anchorage  as  a  transfer 
hub. 

Alaska’s  strategic  position  on  the  Pacific  Rim,  despite  high  fuel 
prices, is another contributing factor to Anchorage’s cargo ranking. 
Faced  with  narrowing  margins,  many  carriers  are  capitalizing  on 
the payload versus range equation. 

Last week marked the 1-year anniversary of the airport’s new C 
Concourse,  and  plans  are  currently  underway  for  $143  million  ret-
rofit  of  the  A  and  B  Concourse  to  bring  them  up  to  seismic  code. 
In  addition  to  structural  improvements,  our  airport  will  see  up-
grades  from  air  carriers  to  include  the  arrival  of  the  A380  for 
FedEx  and  UPS  in  2008  and  2009,  respectively.  The  airport  has 

airport.

been preparing its air field with the help of FAA LOI funds—thank 
you—to accommodate these aircraft. 

AIP  funding  formula  changes  concern  us,  Mr.  Chairman.  In  the 
most  recent  budget  bill,  an  effort  was  made  to  change  the  funding 
formula,  and  ultimately  reduce  cargo  entitlements  in  the  Airport 
Improvement Program, better known as AIP. 

Based  on  this  formula  change,  Anchorage’s  cargo  entitlements 
would be reduced from 14.6 million to 6.8 million. Such a reduction 
in  cargo  entitlements  would  directly  impact  Anchorage’s  ability  to 
provide  the  infrastructure  required  to  support  the  substantial 
growth  in  global  air  cargo  traffic  in  a  national  transportation  sys-
tem.  It’s  critical  to  Anchorage  to  maintain  a  3.5  cargo  entitlement 
rate with no cap. 

Senator  Stevens,  you  were  very  instrumental  in  increasing  the 
cargo  entitlement  rate  from  3  percent  to  3.5  percent  and  removing 
the  cap  for  total  amount  of  cargo  entitlements  funding  to  any  one 
airport. 

Anchorage is the only airport in the Nation that relies so heavily 
on  cargo  entitlements.  Anchorage  currently  accounts  for  nearly  13 
percent of all cargo traffic in the United States. Because Anchorage 
serves  a  critical  transit  point  for  a  large  proportion  of  the  inter-
national  air  cargo  to  and  from  the  United  States,  funding  for  our 
airport, our cargo support for infrastructure is truly a national, not 
merely a local, concern. 

Congress  has  proposed  raising  the  passenger  facility  charge  rate 
from  3.50  to  $8  per  plane  passenger.  For  some  airports,  increased 
PFCs can cover cargo entitlement losses. As an example, Memphis 
is the second largest cargo airport in the United States. A formula 
change  would  reduce  cargo  funding  for  Memphis  by  $7.4  million; 
but they would be able to increase general airport funding by over 
23 million by raising the PFC. This is not the case for our airport. 
The airport, along with Cathay Pacific, would again ask for your 
assistance  to  get  the  Transit  Without  Visa  Waiver  Program  rein-
stated  in  Anchorage.  After  being  assured  many  times  that  DHS 
would  reinstate  this  vital  program,  to  date  it  remains  suspended. 
This program allows passengers traveling from one foreign coun-
try to another foreign country to transit the U.S. without obtaining 
a  U.S.  visa.  To  date,  the  program  remains  suspended.  Unlike  all 
other  airports  in  the  nation,  the  passengers  on  the  ATP  program 
that fly through Anchorage arrive and depart on the same aircraft, 
the same carrier, and the same flight. As to visa-waiver flights, An-
chorage  is  merely  a  transfer  stop—excuse  me,  simply  a  transit 
stop, not a transfer stop. 

It  is  Cathay’s  desire  to  offer  passenger  service  between  Anchor-
age and Hong Kong, but they are unable to do this until the Tran-
sit Without Visa Program is reinstated, at least for secure facilities 
such as ours. 

I  would  recommend  you  support  a  pilot  test  program  at  the  An-

chorage Airport. 

We  recommend  more  flexibility  for  AIP  spending.  Current  FAA 
regulations  are  very  restrictive  on  the  ability  of  airports  to  use 
their  entitlement  funding.  If  the  regulations  were  more  flexible, 
airports would have the ability to use the funding more efficiently. 
For  example,  special  condition  9  of  the  AIP  grant  agreement  pre-

cludes us from purchasing essential pieces of equipment using AIP 
funds. 

Federal  agency  space  requirements  are  problematic  for  airports 
around  the  country.  Federal  agencies  operating  at  airports  should 
be  required  to  pay  for  space  to  insure  that  space  requirements  are 
reasonable,  and  to  encourage  the  agencies  to  use  space  efficiently, 
without duplication, and reduce costs to the airlines. 

Airports are increasingly asked to reduce the cost to carriers and 
to  find  new  and  creative  ways  to  generate  additional  non-aero-
nautical  revenues.  At  the  same  time,  airports  are  being  asked  by 
federal  agencies  to  increase  space  allocated  to  the  agencies.  With 
the  exception  of  TSA,  all  agencies  have  laws  in  place  that  require 
airports to build and furnish space at no cost to agencies. The func-
tion  these  agencies  provide  are  invaluable  to  the  safety  and  secu-
rity  of  our  country,  but  building  extravagant  and  duplicate  facili-
ties  for  agencies  is  a  waste  of  scarce  resources.  So,  as  long  as  the 
law  requires  airports  to  build  facilities  with  no  cost  to  the  federal 
agencies, there is no incentive for the agencies to be practical with 
their requirements. 

With  regard  to  TSA,  we  have  a  very  good  working  relationship 
with  the  leadership.  However,  Anchorage  has  promised  that  new 
security requirements would be reimbursed by TSA. To date, these 
commitments  have  not  been  fulfilled.  In  fact,  Ted  Stevens  Anchor-
age  International  Airport’s  LOI  application  is  now  No.  23  on  the 
list for funding. To date, Anchorage has spent 19.6 million to fund 
TSA-mandated  enhancements  at  Concourse  C,  and  is  projected  to 
spend another 15 million in Concourse A and B. 

We  are  very  proud  of  our  float  plane  accommodations  at  Lake 
Hood. It arguably takes honors as the largest and busiest seaplane 
base in the world. Given the critical importance of generation avia-
tion  to  Alaska,  we  would  appreciate  any  possible  support  for  more 
or alternate general aviation facilities. 

In  conclusion,  the  Ted  Stevens  Anchorage  International  Airport 
serves as a critical transit and transfer point for a large proportion 
of  international  air  cargo  to  and  from  the  United  States.  Our  air-
port is not merely a part of the national air transportation system, 
but a critical international strategic location. 

Senator  Stevens,  Secretary  Mineta,  Administrator  Blakey, 
thanks to all your relentless efforts, we have seen our cargo entitle-
ments  increase  and  our  new  cargo  legislation  adopted  to  enhance 
and maintain our competitive Anchorage in the global marketplace. 
We thank you for your continued support. This is truly an impor-
tant  contribution  you’re  making  to  the  future  economic  well  being 
of our state and the security of our country. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much Mort. 
We’ll  move  on.  Mr.  Thompson  is  the  Alaska  Regional  President 

for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. 

I guess I’m correct, Dick, you’re next in line? We’re just going to 

go down that line. All right.

STATEMENT OF RICHARD HARDING, SENIOR VICE 

PRESIDENT, PENAIR 

Mr.  HARDING.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Stevens,  guests.  Thank 
you for allowing me the opportunity to testify today with regard to 
my experience with the Capstone program. 

The  successes  described  by  Administrator  Marion  Blakey  this 
morning  could  not  have  been  achieved  without  combined  effort  of 
the FAA and the aviation community working closely together. 

I came to Alaska as a young pilot in 1970 with a fresh ATP cer-
tificate in my pocket after learning to fly in California. I believe at 
that  time  there  were  more  VORs  in  the  Los  Angeles  Bowl  area 
than  in  the  entire  State  of  Alaska.  The  transition  was  like  going 
to  a  foreign  country  where  few  navigation  aids  and  many  of  the 
runways  that  were  what  somebody  would  expect  in  a  Third  World 
country. Runways have changed a great deal, especially in the last 
couple  of  years  with  the  additional  funding.  We’ve  got  some  excel-
lent runways now. It’s not par with the Lower 48, but we’re getting 
there  gradually,  and  thanks  to  the  additional  funding.  The  nav 
aids,  however,  are  about  the  same  as  we  had  when  I  came  in  the 
1970’s. 

In  1977,  a  group  of  air  carrier  operators  met  with  the  FAA  and 
some representatives from UPS Technologies to discuss what could 
be  done  to  improve  navigation  communication  in  Alaska.  We  were 
told  that  with  the  new  technology  they  could  produce  almost  any-
thing  we  could  conceive.  And  everything  we  see  today  in  Capstone 
is  what  we  dreamed  of  then,  ADSB  stands  for  Automatic  Depend-
ence  Surveillance  Broadcasts.  ADSB  is  automatic  in  that  there  is 
no  pilot  input  necessary.  It’s  dependent  on  a  series  of  satellites 
rather  than  high  maintenance  ground-based  facilities.  It  gives  us 
capability of surveillance by our operation centers. Aircraft can see 
each other and we can be surveilled by air traffic control. 

The  unit  in  the  aircraft  also  has  the  ability  to  broadcast  as  well 
as receive. The pilot can select any of three displays in the cockpit. 
A  moving  map  display  which  shows  weather,  traffic,  or  terrain. 
Today  our  pilots  don’t  want  to  fly  without  it.  Customers,  pas-
sengers love it. 

We had a little old lady that was going to one of the villages dur-
ing  the  beginning  stages  of  this  program.  She  came  up  to  find  out 
when  her  plane  was  going  to  arrive  and  she  believed—only  about 
half of our airplanes were equipped, and she asked, ‘‘Is the airplane 
that I’m going to be flying in have Capstone stuff in it?’’

One of the advantages in small aircraft is the passengers can see 
the panel and can see this moving map. Most flying in rural Alaska 
is done with these small aircrafts servicing more than 200 commu-
nities  that  are  not  on  any  road  system.  Aircraft  have  to  fly  at  low 
altitudes  to  maintain  visual  conditions  because  there  are  no  low-
altitude airways connecting the villages, nor approaches to the run-
ways  upon  arrival.  The  Capstone  program  has  provided  a  means 
with  emerging  technology  to  address  both  of  these  issues  making 
aviation  in  rural  Alaska  safer  and  more  efficient  to  the  traveling 
public. Capstone has GPS approaches at communities that have no 
other  instrument  approach  procedures.  In  Southeast  Alaska  Cap-
stone has been instrumental in designing and creating low-altitude

airways  outside  of  the  icing  areas  that  allow  aircraft  to  utilize  air 
space that was never available before. 

Capstone  was  the  first  to  use  the  Wide  Area  Augmentation,  the 
WAAS system that Congress has previously funded. When the FAA 
completes  the  WAAS  testing  in  the  rest  of  Alaska,  communities 
will  have  all-weather  access  with  precision  approaches  that  were 
not previously available to them. It will mean all-weather, 24-hour 
access to medical services not available today. 

Many  of  the  communities  that  have  instrument  approaches  do 
not  have  radar  coverage  to  altitudes  below  5,000  feet.  With  Cap-
stone equipment on board, air traffic control can now see traffic on 
the  same  screen  that  they  can  see  high-flying  radar  targets.  This 
technology enables controllers to merge traffic safely, as they do in 
the  rest  of  the  country.  All  progress  accomplished  today  is  in  ac-
cordance  with  the  FAA  concepts  for  the  future  national  air  space 
system. 

The  Capstone  program  is  demonstrating  how  rapid  transmission 
to  the  new  NAS  can  be  accomplished.  The  government  surely  can-
not afford to operate a system side by side for an indefinite transi-
tion period. So it’s essential that the government and industry con-
tinue to work together. 

With the Capstone project emerged a council of industry leaders, 
such  as  members  of  the  air  carriers,  manufacturers,  aviation 
groups  such  as  Alaska  Air  Carriers  Association,  and  several  gov-
ernment  organizations.  This  new  group,  the  Alaska  Aviation  Co-
ordination  Council,  developed  a  5-year  strategic  plan  that  includes 
all  of  the  areas  that  the  FAA  Administrator,  Marion  Blakey,  had 
previously mentioned. 

During the time I have been flying in Alaska we have gone from 
the  oldest,  most  outdated  navigation  system  to  the  cutting  edge 
navigational  equipment.  We  are  all  working  for  the  same  goal:  To 
improve aviation safety in Alaska. 

The Medallion program addresses culture by providing guidance, 
getting  pilots  and  management  involved  in  the  safety  process.  The 
Capstone  program  is  a  technology  center  of  the  partnership.  It  is 
necessary on both working together to make a difference. 

We in Alaska aviation have been fortunate to have the relentless 
support  of  Senator  Stevens.  We  have  also  had  the  backing  of  the 
FAA  administrator,  Marion  Blakey,  and  Secretary  Mineta.  To-
gether  we  have  reduced  the  aviation  accident  rate  and  are  pro-
viding  an  example  of  what  can  be  done  with  a  national  air  space 
transportation system. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing this time.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD HARDING, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, PENAIR 
Good  morning,  Chairman  Stevens,  Senator  Inouye  and  Members  of  the  Com-

my  experience  with  the  Capstone  program.  The  successes  described  by  Adminis-
trator Blakey could not have been achieved without the combined efforts of the FAA

In 1997, a group of air carrier operators met with the FAA and some representa-
tives of UPS Technologies to discuss what could be done to improve navigation and 
communication  in  Alaska.  We  were  told  that  with  the  new  technology,  they  could 
produce  almost  anything  we  could  conceive.  Everything  we  see  today  in  Capstone 
is  what  we  dreamed  of  then.  ADSB  stands  for  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance 
Broadcast.  ADSB  is  automatic,  and  no  pilot  input  is  necessary.  It  is  dependent  on 
a series of satellites, rather than high maintenance ground based facilities. It gives 
us  surveillance  capability  by  our  operations  centers,  other  aircraft,  and  Air  Traffic 
Control. The unit in the aircraft also has the ability to broadcast, as well as receive. 
A pilot can select any of the three displays in the cockpit, on a moving map display, 
weather,  traffic  or  terrain.  Our  pilots  don’t  want  to  fly  without  it.  Our  passengers 
love  it.  We  had  one  in  the  beginning  that  asked  the  gate  when  her  flight  would  be 
ready  and  if  it  had  that  ‘‘Capstone  stuff ’’  In  small  aircraft  the  passengers  can  usu-
ally see the pilot’s panel. 

Most of the flying in rural Alaska is done with these small aircraft, servicing more 
than  200  communities  that  are  not  on  any  road  system.  Aircraft  have  to  fly  at  low 
altitudes  in  visual  conditions  because  there  are  no  low  altitude  airways  connecting 
them, nor approaches to the runways upon arrival. The Capstone program has pro-
vided  a  means  with  its  emerging  technology  to  address  both  these  issues,  making 
aviation in rural Alaska safer and more efficient for the traveling public. The latest 
independent  safety  analysis  reports  accidents  in  the  Capstone  demonstration  area 
have been reduced by 47 percent. 

Capstone  has  initiated  the  installation  of  more  than  40  GPS  approaches  at  com-
munities  that  have  no  other  instrument  approach  procedures.  In  Southeast  Alaska, 
Capstone  has  been  instrumental  in  designing  and  creating  low  altitude  airways, 
outside of icing areas, that allow aircraft to utilize airspace that was never available 
before. Capstone was the first to use the Wide Area Augmentation System that con-
gress had previously funded. When the FAA completes WAAS testing in the rest of 
Alaska,  communities  will  have  all  weather  access,  with  precision  approaches,  that 
were  not  previously  available  to  them.  This  will  mean  all  weather,  24-hour  access 
to medical service, that is not available today. 

Many of the communities that have instrument approaches do not have radar cov-
erage  at  altitudes  below  5,000  feet.  With  Capstone  equipment  on  board,  Air  Traffic 
Control  can  now  see  traffic  on  the  same  screen  they  see  high-flying  radar  targets. 
This  technology  enables  controllers  to  merge  traffic  safely,  as  they  do  in  the  rest 
of the country. All the progress accomplished to date is in accordance with the FAA 
concepts  for  the  future  National  Airspace  System.  The  Capstone  Program  is  dem-
onstrating  how  a  rapid  transition  to  the  new  National  Airspace  System  can  be  ac-
complished.  The  government  surely  cannot  afford  to  operate  dual  systems  side-by-
side for an indefinite transition period, so it is essential that government and indus-
try continue to work together. 

From the Capstone project emerged a council of industry leaders such as members 
of  air  carriers,  manufactures,  aviation  groups  such  as  the  Air  Carriers  Association, 
and several government organizations. This new group, the Alaska Aviation Coordi-
nation  Council  developed  a  five-year  strategic  plan  that  includes  all  of  the  areas 
FAA Administrator Blakey had previously mentioned. 

During the time I have been flying in Alaska, we have gone from the oldest, most 
outdated  navigation  system,  to  cutting  edge  navigational  equipment.  We  are  all 
working toward the same goal, to improve aviation safety in Alaska. The Medallion 
program addresses the culture by providing guidance in getting pilots and manage-
ment  involved  in  the  safety  process.  The  Capstone  program  is  the  technology  side 
of  the  partnership.  It  is  necessary  to  have  both  working  together  to  make  the  dif-
ference. 

We,  in  Alaskan  aviation,  have  been  fortunate  to  have  the  relentless  support  of 
Senator  Stevens.  We  have  also  had  the  backing  of  the  FAA  Administrator  Marion 
Blakey. Together, we have reduced the Alaskan aviation accident rate and are pro-
viding an example of what can be done in the National Airspace System. 

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak today.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Glad to have you here. 
Just go right on down the line. Mr. Dennis. 

STATEMENT OF JERRY DENNIS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE 

MEDALLION FOUNDATION 

Mr. DENNIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Good  morning,  Chairman  Stevens.  My  name  is  Jerry  Dennis.  I 
am the Executive Director of the Medallion Foundation. I do appre-
ciate  the  fact  that  the  Committee  has  chosen  to  have  this  hearing 
here,  and  specifically  would  like  to  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to 
talk to the Medallion Foundation. 

More  than  32  years  ago  I  came  to  Alaska  as  an  NTSB  investi-
gator.  At  that  time,  the  accident  rate  was  much  higher.  In  fact, 
during  my  time  with  the  safety  board,  I  personally  averaged  110 
accident  investigations  a  year,  which  is  far  more  than  the  total 
number of mishaps in Alaska that was attested to by Mr. Poe just 
a  few  moments  ago.  When  you  consider  that  we  had  three  inves-
tigators  all  averaging  about  the  same,  you  can  see  there’s  been  a 
considerable improvement. 

However, flying in Alaska in the 1970s and 1980s is not like fly-

ing in Alaska today. Or, actually, is it? 

In  1979  I  was  part  of  the  NTSB  special  study  on  air  taxi  safety 
in Alaska. Except for the advancements in technology, almost every 
item  we’ve  discussed  in  that  study  has  been  echoed  in  succeeding 
studies,  including  the  one  referenced  by  the  FAA  Administrator  in 
her  testimony  earlier  today.  It  is  significant  that  the  same  prob-
lems were identified not by one additional study, but by 4 separate 
studies. How can this be? 

I  believe  it  is  because  we  are  a  highly  regulated  industry  and 
have been doing the same things over and over again. All the time 
using the FAA regulations as our safety net. Einstein had an inter-
esting definition for ‘‘insanity’’: Doing the same thing over and over 
again and expecting different results. 

I  believe  that  the  Medallion  Foundation  has  broken  that  mold, 
and  the  key  is  not  additional  regulations  or  another  safety  pro-
gram.  But,  instead,  it  is  dedicated  people  armed  with  the  license 
to  learn  in  the  industry  and  educating  others  using  a  back-to-ba-
sics, one-on-one training philosophy. 

A  quick  review  will  show  that  every  major  reduction  in  aircraft 
accidents  has  resulted  from  a  change  in  technology.  It  is  because 
of these improvements that the focus has not been on manufactur-
ers,  but  on  more  tangible  technological  solutions.  However,  the  ac-
cidents are still occurring and the pilot is still cited as a causal fac-
tor in more than 70 to 75 percent of the mishaps. 

The Capstone technology being discussed here today has reduced 
accidents  and  is  a  wonderful  tool.  I’m  hear  to  say,  the  Medallion 
Foundation  Five  Star  Shield  Program  is  also  a  very  valuable  tool 
that  is  focused  on  human  factors  and  the  organization.  It  has  also 
reduced accidents throughout Alaska. 

This program is unique in that it was developed by the industry, 
not  the  government.  It  is  based  on  the  belief  that  the  individuals 
doing the job usually know more about what is wrong than anyone 
else. And 9 times out of 10, they also know the answer to the prob-
lem. The Medallion programs are based on this concept and they’re 
a  step  above  the  regulations.  A  voluntary  process  that  has  higher 
safety  goals  that  can  be  tailored  to  each  operator  based  on  their 
needs and requirements. 

Why is this program working? One of the primary reasons is be-
cause  it’s  good  business  and  demonstrates  that  safety  can  be  a 
profit  center.  The  Senior  Vice  President  of  PenAir,  Mr.  Richard

Harding,  sitting  to  my  right,  has  stated  on  numerous  occasions 
that the shield program has reduced their occupational exposure by 
as much as 60 percent. When you look at the cost of workers’ com-
pensation today, that equates to real dollars. 

Another  reason,  and  a  big  one,  is  that  the  program  is  proactive, 
not  reactive.  It  is  based  on  what  people  do  right,  not  how  to  pre-
vent the last accident. 

Another  important  part  of  this  success  story  is  the  relationship 
we  have  with  the  FAA.  This  type  of  program  would  have  been  dif-
ficult, if not impossible, just 10 years ago. And even with this part-
nership approach, it still took well over a year to get the inspectors 
to acknowledge that we had something to offer. 

One other very important advantage that we have over any gov-
ernment  agency  is  flexibility.  We  can  change  things  as  we  see  fit 
and do it now. 

In  the  past  3  years,  we  have  instituted  6  improvements  to  the 
program.  We  still  have  oversight  from  the  FAA,  as  our  monthly 
meetings  and  quarterly  reports  will  attest.  But  I  believe  that  the 
FAA now looks on the Medallion Foundation as a tool they can use 
as well. 

I  firmly  believe  that  given  the  current  evolution  of  the  program 
in  the  next  6  to  9  months,  the  FAA  will  be  able  to  use  the  Medal-
lion  programs  to  assist  in  their  evaluation  of  an  operator,  and  will 
be able to focus their resources on more troubled carriers. 

I also believe that using our process-based approach and a viable 
internal  evaluation  program  will  be  the  basis  for  a  limited  form  of 
self-regulation  that  may  change  the  nature  of  government  over-
sight. 

The grant provided by Congress with the sponsorship of Senator 
Stevens has already changed aviation in Alaska. I believe that the 
programs being developed here, both Medallion, Capstone, weather 
cams,  and  others,  will  eventually  be  utilized  in  the  Lower  48  and 
other parts of the world as well. 

In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  the 
opportunity  to  testify  on  the  subject.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer 
any questions you might have. 

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. Thompson. 

STATEMENT  OF  RICK  THOMPSON,  ALASKAN  REGIONAL  VICE 
PRESIDENT,  NATIONAL  AIR  TRAFFIC  CONTROLLERS
ASSOCIATION 
Mr.  THOMPSON.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  appreciate  the 

opportunity to testify today on Alaskan aviation issues. 

I’m  a  20-year  veteran  air  traffic  controller  at  the  Anchorage  Air 
Traffic  Control  Center.  NATCA  has  a  long  history  of  supporting 
new  aviation  technology  and  modernizing  our  nation’s  air  traffic 
control  system  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  aviation  services. 
In Alaska we have a number of unique opportunities to be on the 
cutting  edge  of  new  technology.  Today  I’ll  address  issues  affecting 
those factors. NATCA is not interested in simply pointing out chal-
lenges;  we  are  prepared  to  offer  solutions.  The  issues  we  face  are 
not  insurmountable,  rather  they  present  opportunities  for  aviation

stakeholders  to  provide  input  and  expertise  that  allow  us  to  con-
tinue to build Alaska’s aviation infrastructure. 

The  FAA  is  facing  a  nationwide  air  traffic  controller  retirement 
crisis. NATCA has been working secure funds to hire and train the 
next  generation  of  controllers.  Unfortunately,  the  slow  pace  of  hir-
ing has exacerbated the problem. Anchorage Center is staffed at 88 
percent  of  its  authorized  control  positions,  and  15  percent  of  the 
work force will be eligible to retire in 24 months. The critical avia-
tion  network  in  Alaska  cannot  meet  the  needs  of  our  state  if  this 
problem is not addressed. 

This  situation  has  been  exacerbated  by  Anchorage  Center  new 
sector  staffing  plan  in  the  increase  in  the  Anchorage’s  supervisor 
staffing because they hire directly from the control ranks. Manage-
ment  at  the  Anchorage  Center  unilaterally  instituted  a  new  sector 
staffing  plan.  Under  the  plan,  controller  resources  are  allocated 
based on meaningless metrics rather than user demand and safety. 
This  plan  does  not  fit  the  dynamic  flow  of  the  air  traffic  system. 
It  has  impeded  quick  responses  to  capacity,  and  consequently,  re-
duced the margin of safety. 

We are open and willing to discuss the best most efficient use of 
staff.  However,  the  FAA  has  rejected  our  offers  to  be  included  in 
such  discussions.  Anchorage  Center  has  also  increased  the  level  of 
supervisor  staff.  A  year  ago  there  were  12  first-level  supervisors, 
resulting  in  a  ratio  of  about  10  controllers  per  supervisor.  Today, 
the agency is hiring a total of 21 first-level supervisors, for a ratio 
of  5.5  controllers  per  supervisor.  I  have  2-year-old  twins.  There  is 
more supervision of air traffic controllers in Anchorage Center than 
there is of my 2-years-olds at their day care. 

This  does  not  improve  the  services  in  Alaska.  This  only  serves 
the  bureaucracy,  and  reduces  our  ability  to  deliver  services  to  our 
users. 

Today  we  face  a  number  of  issues  modernizing  ATC  infrastruc-
ture.  Regular  preventative  maintenance  of  communication,  naviga-
tion, and surveillance systems is needed to insure the reliability of 
the  NAS.  The  FAA  has  decided  to  resurrect  parts  of  a  failed  Alas-
kan test under the new name Reliability Center Maintenance. 

The  agency  states  that  the  necessary  analysis  has  been  com-
pleted  to  validate  the  event-based  approach  to  maintaining  the 
safety-critical  equipment.  Yet  the  decision  was  made  before  our 
work  group  chartered  to  study  the  problems  was  ever  convened. 
NATCA asked that the agency hold an open discussion with stake-
holders prior to implementing this program. 

We  opposed  eliminating  24-hour  air  traffic  control  services  at 
Fairbanks  International  Airport.  Fairbanks  Air  Traffic  Control 
Tower is a 24-hour tower and approach control which handles over 
927,000  passengers  per  year.  Fairbanks  International  is  the  eco-
nomic,  transportation,  medical,  financial  and  government  hub  of 
Interior Alaska. A reduction of services is not efficient, effective, or 
safe. 

The  cost  savings  did  not  justify  the  safety  and  economic  impact 
of  reduced  services.  The  FAA/NATCA  liaison  program  allowed  for 
the  involvement  of  air  traffic  controllers  and  technical  experts  in 
modernization  efforts.  It  has  resulted  in  cost  savings,  on  time  de-
ployment,  and  successful  implementation  of  new  technology.  How-

ever, on June 28th the FAA informed NATCA that it is terminating 
this  effort  due  to  budget  constraints.  This  includes  George  Lloyd 
from Anchorage Tricon who has been serving as the ANB 500 liai-
son responsible for Capstone and ADSB for the past year. 

NATCA supports the full and complete development of Capstone 
initiative  to  use  ADSB  as  an  air  traffic  control  tool  in  Alaska.  The 
Capstone program has enhanced the safety of the entire operations 
in  Alaska.  NATCA  believes  the  FAA  should  concentrate  its  Cap-
stone  program  resources  on  completing  air  traffic  control  concepts 
contained  in  Phase  I—approach  control  services  for  Bethel—before 
moving to Phase II—approach control services for Juneau. 

Aircraft  operators  in  the  Bethel  area  have  been  looking  for  the 
FAA  to  provide  control  surveillance  approach  control  services  in 
order to increase the capacity of the Bethel Airport during the spe-
cial  VFR  and  IFR  operations.  This  goal  can  be  reached.  NATCA 
supports  this  objective,  and  we  have  worked  to  insure  these  new 
services can be provided. However, development problems continue. 
Last  week  FAA  management  made  the  decision  to  turn  the  Cap-
stone  information  off  Anchorage  Center’s  radar  screens.  This  was 
the  result  of  data  integrity  problems  of  unknown  origins  created 
by—creating  an  unacceptable  safety  risk.  Management  was  aware 
of the problems for weeks, but did not inform the controllers of the 
mounting concerns prior to disabling the data. 

NATCA  recognizes  the  significant  safety  potential  of  the  ADSB 
technologies in air traffic control tool. However, in its current state, 
the  Capstone  program  lacks  the  proper  oversight  and  direction 
needed to be successful in fielding a fully integrated air traffic con-
trol tool. 

NATCA  is  prepared  and  willing  to  work  with  the  agency  com-
pleting  Capstone  Phase  I  and  Phase  II.  I  ask  that  the  FAA  fully 
engage NATCA in the critical discussions that must take place. 

By  working  together  to  address  the  decisions  at  hand,  we  can 
move  rapidly  to  provide  Bethel  and  Juneau  system  users  to  need 
services in an efficient and timely manner. 

The  Capstone  office  has  also  created  a  plan  to  divest  ground-
based  navigational  aids  in  Alaska  and  shut  down  Alaska’s  long-
range  radars.  To  my  knowledge,  this  plan  was  developed  without 
the  input  of  system  users  and  air  traffic  controllers  in  Alaska. 
NATCA  asks  that  any  plan  with  such  a  magnitude  and  impact  on 
Alaskan aviation be discussed in an open and public forum. 

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  on  Alaskan  aviation 
issues. On behalf of NATCA and the Alaskan air traffic controllers, 
we look forward to working with you and your staff to ensure that 
our air traffic control system remains the safest and most efficient 
in the world. 

And  I’ll  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  that  you  may  have.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICK THOMPSON, ALASKAN REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT, 

NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION 

Good  morning  Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  this  opportunity  to  testify  today  on 
Alaskan  aviation  issues.  I  am  Rick  Thompson,  Alaskan  Regional  Vice  President  for 
the  National  Air  Traffic  Controllers  Association.  NATCA  represents  about  20,000 
FAA safety-related professionals in a variety of positions including air traffic control

specialists,  engineers,  architects  and  pilots.  I  am  also  a  21-year  veteran  air  traffic 
controller at the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZAN). 

I  am  honored  to  represent  these  aviation  safety  professionals  and  to  speak  on 
their behalf today. NATCA has a long history of supporting new aviation technology, 
modernizing  and  enhancing  our  nation’s  air  traffic  control  system  and  working  to 
ensure we are prepared to meet the growing demand for aviation services. In Alas-
ka, we have had a number of unique opportunities to be on the cutting edge of new 
technology.  Today,  I  want  to  address  a  number  of  issues—Anchorage  Center  Staff-
ing,  NATCA’s  involvement  in  air  traffic  control  modernization  and  the  Capstone 
project, air traffic control infrastructure decisions, and controller retention issues in 
Alaska. NATCA is not interested in simply pointing out challenges; we are prepared 
to  offer  solutions.  The  challenges  we  face  are  not  insurmountable,  rather  they 
present  opportunities  for  aviation  stakeholders  to  provide  input  and  expertise  that 
will  allow  us  to  continue  to  build  the  aviation  infrastructure  in  Alaska,  maintain 
and enhance the global leadership we inherited, and meet the needs of our commu-
nity. 
Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZAN) Staffing 

As  the  Committee  is  aware,  the  FAA  is  facing  a  nationwide  air  traffic  controller 
retirement  crisis.  NATCA  has  been  working  for  years  to  secure  the  much-needed 
funds  to  hire  and  train  the  next  generation  of  air  traffic  controllers.  Unfortunately, 
the  slow  pace  of  hiring  has  only  exacerbated  the  problem.  In  fact,  there  are  1,000 
fewer controllers in the FAA than just 2 years ago. 

In  the  December  2004  Air  Traffic  Controller  Workforce  Plan,  the  agency  states 
that it plans to hire 1249 air traffic controllers in FY06. And, for the first time, the 
agency  acknowledged  that  its  prior  hiring  policy  of  one  hire  for  one  retirement  is 
not adequate because of the time needed to train a new controller. Yet, their budget 
request provided $24.9 million to hire 595 air traffic controllers. It seems they only 
intend  to  hire  the  other  654  controllers  based  on  attrition—contrary  to  their  ac-
knowledgement  that  one  for  one  hiring  is  not  adequate.  Considering  the  projected 
losses in 2005, this plan does not keep pace with current demand. 

At  Anchorage  Center,  there  are  currently  112  air  traffic  control  specialists  on 
board,  only  88  percent  of  the  number  required  under  the  FAA’s  system  (127).  Of 
those  currently  on  board,  15  percent  are  eligible  to  retire  in  the  next  24  months. 
Simply put, Mr. Chairman, the critical aviation network in Alaska cannot meet the 
needs of our state if this problem is not addressed. 
Air Traffic Organization 

A  primary  stated  objective  of  the  new  Air  Traffic  Organization  was  to  reduce  the 
layers of management between Chief Operating Officer and the delivery of air traffic 
services  (controllers).  Specifically,  the  stated  goal  was  to  reduce  from  11  to  6  the 
layers of management between the COO and the air traffic controllers. NATCA sup-
ported this initiative. Unfortunately, Anchorage Center is moving in the opposite di-
rection.  About  a  year  ago,  there  were  12  first  level  supervisors  resulting  in  a  ratio 
of about 10 controllers per supervisor. Today, there are 18 first level supervisors and 
the  agency  is  planning  to  hire  another  three  for  a  total  of  21  first  level  supervisors 
or a ratio of 5.5 controllers per supervisor. I have two-year-old twins. There is more 
supervision  of  air  traffic  controllers  at  Anchorage  Center  than  there  is  of  my  two-
year-old  twins  at  their  daycare.  Alaska  State  law  requires  one  daycare  worker  per 
six kids under the age of two, and at age three it is only a 10-to-1 ratio. 

The  increase  in  first  level  supervisors  is  costly,  inefficient  and  only  serves  to  fur-
ther  exacerbate  the  air  traffic  controller  staffing  problem  as  supervisors  are  picked 
directly  from  the  controller  workforce.  It  has  not  made  the  system  or  Anchorage 
Center  operations  safer.  Now  we  simply  have  more  people  watching  fewer  people 
talking  to  more  airplanes.  In  addition,  the  number  of  second  level  supervisors  has 
also  increased  at  Anchorage  Center.  And,  the  agency  plans  to  add  another  level  of 
management  at  the  top  of  their  three  Regional  Service  Areas.  The  ATO  was  sup-
posed  to  streamline  the  system,  but  in  Alaska  it  has  served  only  to  bloat  the  bu-
reaucracy,  increasing  the  costs  and  reducing  our  ability  to  deliver  service  to  our 
users. 

In  May  2005,  management  at  Anchorage  Center  unilaterally  instituted  a  new 
ZAN sector staffing plan. Under this plan resources are allocated based on a mean-
ingless  metrics  rather  than  user  demand  and  safety.  Areas  are  now  staffed  at  60 
percent  regardless  of  the  volume  and  complexity  of  traffic.  Thus  during  periods  of 
low  traffic  volume,  controllers  are  plugged  in  when  they  could  be  performing  other 
assigned  duties  such  as  training,  proficiency  work  or  reading  the  daily  briefings. 
Conversely,  in  times  of  peak  traffic  volume  when  additional  controllers  are  needed, 
none  are  available.  The  new  staffing  plan  does  not  fit  the  dynamic  flow  of  the  air

traffic  system.  In  fact,  it  impedes  quick  responses  to  capacity  demands  and  con-
sequentially  reduces  the  margin  of  safety.  NATCA  and  the  Anchorage  Center  con-
trollers  are  open  and  willing  to  discuss  the  best  and  most  efficient  use  of  resources 
and staff. However, the FAA has rejected our subject matter expertise and declined 
to include us in any such discussions or decisions. 
Reliability Centered Maintenance 

The FAA is radically changing the existing proven system of maintaining and cer-
tifying  navigational  aids,  radars,  and  air  traffic  control  communication  frequencies. 
Five years ago, the FAA tested a revised maintenance program for navigational aids 
in  Alaska  called  Corporate  Maintenance  Philosophy  (CMP).  Under  this  program, 
regular  preventative  maintenance  of  communication,  navigation  and  surveillance 
systems  was  no  longer  conducted.  Only  when  the  equipment  failed  would  someone 
be  sent  for  repairs.  While  that  might  work  for  the  Maytag  repairman  and  your 
washing  machine,  it  did  not  work  for  air  traffic  control  critical  equipment,  which 
in  Alaska  is  often  in  remote  locations  with  no  road  access.  Ultimately,  the  number 
of important navigational aids out of service because of failures in Alaska escalated 
and escalated, and the program failed. 

Unfortunately,  the  FAA  has  decided  to  resurrect  parts  of  this  program  under  a 
new  name,  Reliability  Centered  Maintenance  (RCM).  The  agency  states  the  nec-
essary  engineering  analysis  has  been  completed  to  validate  the  event-based  ap-
proach of maintaining this safety critical equipment. Yet, the decision was made be-
fore  the  workgroup  chartered  to  study  the  problem  ever  convened.  RCM’s  purpose 
is to cut costs by deferring maintenance on sites that the FAA deems are unimpor-
tant  or  too  costly  to  maintain.  It  did  not  work  5  years  ago  under  CMP  and  it  will 
not work today under the new title of RCM. 

NATCA  is  very  concerned  that  the  agency  is  reinstating  this  failed  program.  If 
the navigational aids, communication frequencies and radars are not properly main-
tained,  the  reliability  of  the  NAS  will  suffer.  Air  traffic  routes  and  approaches  to 
airports  may  not  be  available  when  needed  adding  time  and  financial  burdens  to 
the users and the flying public. Since the aviation system in Alaska is the sole life-
line for many communities, this program will have a significant impact. Accordingly, 
NATCA believes the agency should hold an open forum to receive feedback from the 
system  users  prior  to  implementation.  Our  community  understands  the  importance 
of  a  reliable  aviation  system  and  critical  decisions  should  not  be  made  from  FAA 
in  Washington  without  any  input  from  those  who  know  and  understand  Alaska 
aviation. 
Fairbanks Air Traffic Control Tower 

Fairbanks  Air  Traffic  Control  Tower  (FAI)  is  an  instrumental  flight  rule  tower 
and  approach  control  facility  that  handles  over  927,000  passengers  per  year.  Fair-
banks  International  Airport  is  the  economic,  transportation,  medical,  financial,  and 
government  hub  of  interior  Alaska.  In  fact,  the  airport  serves  as  the  alternate  for 
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. During low IFR conditions (below ar-
riving  aircraft  approach  minimums)  aircraft  scheduled  to  land  at  Anchorage  are 
often diverted to Fairbanks. 

The  Fairbanks  approach  control  facility  also  handles  traffic  to  and  from  the  Fort 
Wainwright  Army  Base  home  of  the  1st  Brigade,  6th  Infantry  Division  (Light)  and 
the Eielson Air force Base which is the northernmost U.S. fighter wing in the world, 
the  354th  Fighter  Wing’s  A/OA–10  Thunderbolt  II  and  F–16  Viper  aircraft.  Eielson 
is also home to Cope Thunder, the largest aerial exercise in the Pacific region, held 
four times a year. 

Earlier this year, the FAA announced its plan to eliminate 24-hour air traffic con-
trol operations at 42 towers nationwide as a way to cut costs. Fairbanks Air Traffic 
Control Tower is on the list. Initially, the agency’s FY06 budget submission assumed 
a $2 million cost savings yet in recent testimony the agency has stated the savings 
could  be  $6  million  for  eliminating  services  at  all  42  towers  during  the  overnight 
hours. 

NATCA strongly opposes efforts by the FAA to reduce service and thus reduce the 
margin  of  safety.  Air  traffic  is  no  longer  experiencing  the  effects  of  the  post  Sep-
tember  11,  2001  decline.  The  agency  states  that  flight  activity  during  any  period 
where  the  tower  is  unmanned  will  be  handled  by  the  appropriate  en  route  center 
or  TRACON.  These  facilities  are  already  doing  more  with  less.  In  the  case  of  Fair-
banks,  Anchorage  Center  would  assume  responsibility  for  activity  at  the  tower. 
However,  the  air  traffic  controllers  at  Anchorage  Center  are  not  familiar  with  the 
airport  and  cannot  see  the  runways.  They  will  not  be  able  to  tell  a  pilot  if  there 
is  a  problem  with  the  weather,  debris  on  the  runways,  maintenance  on  the  airport 
surface,  etc.  In  addition  to  commercial  traffic,  most  of  these  towers  handle  emer-

38

gency  landings,  diverted  passenger  flights,  delayed  traffic,  major  air  freight  oper-
ations, and military operations 24 hours a day. 

NATCA  recognizes  the  budgetary  issues  facing  the  agency  and  the  industry.  In 
fact, we have offered several cost savings measures—that do not reduce capacity or 
safety—to  authorizers,  appropriators  and  agency  officials.  We  believe  the  FAA’s 
budget  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  system  but  the  agency  continues  to 
make unwise spending choices. Turning the lights off in these towers is not efficient, 
effective  or  safe.  The  cost  savings  do  not  justify  the  safety  and  economic  impact  of 
reduced service. 
Air Traffic Control Modernization 

For over a decade, NATCA has been working day and night with the FAA to move 
new  technologies  into  the  workplace  as  quickly,  efficiently  and  safely  as  possible. 
FAA  modernization  is  an  ongoing  process  and  NATCA  has  been  directly  involved 
in every technology project from its inception. This collaboration and teamwork has 
been instrumental in ensuring the success of vital technology projects from en route 
modernization  (Display  System  Replacement)  to  runway  safety  technology  (Airport 
Surface  Detection  Equipment).  However,  on  June  28,  2005  the  FAA  informed 
NATCA  that  it  is  terminating  the  liaison  program  effective  July  29,  2005  due  to 
budget  constraints.  This  includes  George  Lloyd  from  Anchorage  TRACON  who  has 
been  serving  as  the  AND–500  Liaison  responsible  for  Capstone  and  ADS–B  for  the 
past year. 

The liaison program has routinely demonstrated success and has been commended 
by  FAA  management  officials  and  contractors.  In  fact,  a  November  2004  Govern-
ment  Accountability  Office  report  emphasized  the  need  to  involve  controllers  ‘‘early 
and  throughout  FAA’s  ground  systems  approval  process.’’  The  report  found  that 
when  the  FAA  did  not  involve  air  traffic  controllers  and  technical  experts,  its  new 
air traffic control systems experienced cost over-runs and schedule delays. And just 
this  week,  ATO  Chief  Operating  Officer  Russ  Chew  praised  the  collaborative  effort 
that marked the successful implementation of new technology (ATOP) at New York 
Center  that  provides  satellite  coverage  of  oceanic  air  traffic.  The  agency’s  action  is 
short-sighted and will only hamper air traffic control modernization efforts. 
Capstone 

NATCA  supports  the  full  and  complete  development  of  the  Capstone  initiative  to 
use  Automatic  Dependent  Surveillance  (ADS–B)  as  an  air  traffic  control  tool  in 
Alaska.  The  Capstone  Program  has  enhanced  the  safety  of  visual  flight  rule  (VFR) 
operations in Alaska’s difficult terrain and challenging weather conditions. However, 
we are concerned with the FAA’s lack of focus in properly completing ADS–B’s tech-
nological development into a fully integrated and useful air traffic control tool. 

A primary goal for ADS–B in Alaska is to become an integrated, seamless air traf-
fic  control  tool  for  the  instrument  flight  rule  (IFR)  environment  by  providing  new 
and expanded radar services via Phase I (the Bethel area) and Phase II (the Juneau 
area). As you are aware, the aircraft operators in the Bethel area have been looking 
for the FAA to provide true radar approach control services in order to increase the 
capacity  of  the  Bethel  Airport  during  SVFR  and  IFR  conditions.  This  goal  can  be 
reached.  NATCA  supports  this  objective  and  we  have  worked  to  ensure  this  new 
service can be provided remotely by controllers at Fairbanks approach control. 

On December 31, 2000, Yute Air Flight 103 contacted Anchorage Center requested 
and  received  the  first  ever  ADS–B  vector  for  the  ILS  18  approach  at  Bethel.  Since 
that  demonstration  flight  almost  5  years  ago,  Alaskan  air  traffic  controllers  have 
been  waiting  for  the  FAA  to  provide  the  necessary  equipment  and  staffing  so  we 
can provide this enhanced service. 

In  September  2002,  the  FAA  Alaskan  Region  completed  a  study  recommending  a 
dedicated  approach  control  service  for  Bethel  be  established  using  ADS–B  tech-
nology and that the service be provided by Fairbanks approach control. NATCA sup-
ports this decision. 

In  May  2003,  the  FAA  Alaskan  Region  finally  gave  NATCA  a  notice  to  bargain 
over  the  numerous  issues  involved  with  Bethel  approach  services  being  remote  to 
Fairbanks.  With  the  establishment  of  a  new  service  a  number  of  major  items  must 
be  addressed  including  control  room  equipment,  staffing,  training,  procedures  and 
in this case the needed approval of the use of Terminal rules (3 nm spacing between 
aircraft)  versus  en  route  rule  (5  nm  spacing  between  aircraft),  plus  software 
functionality enhancements (I.E. 4096 adjustable codes). 

NATCA  and  the  FAA  Alaskan  Region  spent  a  considerable  amount  of  time  and 
effort  and  made  major  progress  addressing  these  issues.  Then,  in  April  2004  with 
the  Air  Traffic  Organization’s  (ATO)  implementation,  I  received  a  letter  from  the 
FAA withdrawing themselves from negotiations and consequentially ending produc-

tive work on the Bethel Approach Control project. NATCA remains perplexed by the 
agency’s action. 

NATCA believes that the FAA should concentrate its Capstone Program resources 
on completing the air traffic control concepts contained in Phase I (approach control 
services  for  Bethel)  before  moving  to  Phase  II  (approach  control  services  for  Ju-
neau).  Under  the  FAA’s  scattered  approach  to  implementation,  only  5  of  the  10 
ADS–B  ground  based  transceivers  in  the  Bethel  area  are  being  used  for  air  traffic 
control purposes today. 

Rather  than  working  with  NATCA  in  an  open  and  constructive  environment  to 
quickly address the issues inherent in providing new air traffic control services, the 
FAA has been increasingly evasive, secretive and appears to lack the clear direction 
to quickly complete Capstone Phase I and Phase II. There are numerous failed past 
examples of air traffic control tools and equipment that the agency has tried to field 
without  controller  input.  Case  in  point  is  the  Advanced  Automation  System  of  the 
1990s  which  resulted  in  an  overly  complex,  unusable  system  costing  the  taxpayers 
over $1 billon. 

NATCA  recognizes  the  significant  potential  of  ADS–B  technology  as  a  successful 
air  traffic  control  tool.  However,  in  its  current  state,  the  Capstone  program  lacks 
the  proper  oversight  and  direction  needed  to  be  successful  as  a  fully  integrated  air 
traffic control tool. NATCA is prepared and willing to work with the Agency in com-
pleting  Capstone  Phase  I  and  II.  Respectfully,  I  ask  that  the  Committee  direct  the 
FAA  to  fully  engage  NATCA  in  the  critical  discussions  that  must  take  place.  By 
working  together  to  address  the  many  issues  at  hand,  we  can  move  rapidly  to  pro-
vide  the  Bethel  and  Juneau  air  traffic  control  system  users  and  the  flying  public 
the needed services in an efficient and timely manner. 
Capstone Phase III/Decommissioning of Alaskan Navaids 

The Capstone office hired MITRE Corporation to create a plan for the divestment 
of  Ground  Based  Navigational  Aids  (GBNA)  in  Alaska.  The  report  states  that  ‘‘pre-
liminary  results  indicate  that  83  of  118  legacy  GBNAs  (the  term  for  current 
Navaids)  can  be  divested  under  this  strategy  (approximately  70  percent).’’  It  ac-
knowledges  that  this  proposed  strategy  is  different  from  the  current  FAA  strategy 
in  the  lower  48  in  that,  ‘‘it  implies  full  Wide  Area  Augmentation  System  (WAAS) 
equipage  for  aircraft  based  in  the  state  (Alaska)  and  that  it  does  not  retain  a  cov-
erage-based backup structure based on GBNAs’’. In addition, the report did not con-
sider military operations. 

To  my  knowledge,  this  plan  was  developed  without  the  input  of  FAA  air  traffic, 
the system users, and the air traffic controllers in Alaska. MITRE has also informed 
Anchorage Center that they have been commissioned by Capstone to study shutting 
down Alaska’s long range radars beginning with two sites on the west coast. 

NATCA  asks  that  any  study  of  such  magnitude  and  impact  on  Alaskan  aviation 
be  discussed  in  an  open  and  public  forum.  That  discussion  should  at  a  minimum 
include  the  commercial  operators,  general  aviation,  military  users,  the  public  at 
large and the air traffic controllers who daily operate the system. 
COLA vs. Locality Pay for Air Traffic Controllers 

The retirement benefits of civilian federal employees stationed in Alaska, Hawaii, 
Guam,  Puerto  Rico  and  other  non-foreign  duty  locations  outside  the  contiguous  48 
states  are  lower  than  their  counterparts  in  the  continental  United  States.  As  a  re-
sult,  Alaska  continues  to  lose  experienced  air  traffic  controllers  who  transfer  out  of 
state  in  order  to  qualify  for  the  higher  retirement  benefits.  Accordingly,  NATCA 
support a transition from cost-of-living allowances (COLAs) to locality pay. 

The  U.S.  Government  pays  COLAs  to  white-collar  civilian  Federal  employees  in 
Alaska,  Hawaii,  Guam  and  the  Commonwealth  of  the  Northern  Mariana  Islands, 
Puerto  Rico,  and  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  On  August  17,  2000,  the  United  States 
District  Court  of  the  Virgin  Islands  approved  the  settlement  of  Caraballo  et  al.  v. 
United  States,  Civil  No.  197/27  (D.V.I.).  Caraballo  was  a  class-action  lawsuit  in 
which  the  plaintiffs  contested  the  methodology  Office  of  Personnel  Management 
(OPM)  used  to  determine  COLA  rates.  The  settlement  resulted  in  revised  proce-
dures  to  survey  prices,  set  a  base  COLA  rate  for  each  site,  and  created  a  less  vola-
tile process to revise COLA rates. 

OPM surveys the prices of over 200 items, including goods and services, housing, 
transportation,  and  miscellaneous  expenses  in  each  of  the  three  primary  allowance 
areas  (Alaska,  the  Pacific  Islands,  and  the  Caribbean)  once  every  three  years  and 
in  the  Washington,  DC,  area  each  year.  The  current  COLA  rate  for  Alaska  is  25 
percent. The Alaskan survey will result in a COLA reduction of one percent per year 
for  federal  employees  in  Anchorage,  Fairbanks  and  Juneau  starting  in  January 
2006.  The  reductions  will  continue  until  the  new  lower  target  rates  of  Anchorage

13  percent,  Fairbanks  16  percent,  and  Juneau  19  percent  are  reached.  The  next 
OPM survey of Alaska is scheduled for early 2006. 

The  significant  gap  in  retirement  benefits  is  a  result  in  the  difference  between 
COLA and locality pay. COLA is authorized by section 5941 of Title 5, United States 
Code and Executive Order 10000 (as amended). COLA is based on the difference be-
tween  the  cost  of  goods  and  services  in  the  DC  metro  area  vs.  the  cost  of  a  similar 
package of goods and services in each respective COLA area. COLA is exempt from 
federal income tax and does not count toward for federal retirement benefits. 

The  provision  for  locality  pay  is  set  in  the  Federal  Employees  Pay  Comparability 
Act of 1990 (FEPCA) and does not apply outside CONUS. Locality pay is a measure 
of  the  cost  of  labor  in  a  geographic  area.  Locality  pay  is  not  exempt  from  federal 
income tax and is included in determining federal retirement benefits. 

Look  at  two  air  traffic  controllers  under  the  Civil  Service  Retirement  System 
(CSRS)—one working at Anchorage Center and one working at Seattle Center—with 
the  same  base  salary  ($90,000/yr.)  and  the  same  pay  grade  (ATC–10).  Upon  retire-
ment the Seattle controller will receive at least $619 per month more in retirement 
than  the  Anchorage  controller.  This  is  because  the  Seattle  controller  qualifies  for 
16.53  percent  locality  pay  which  is  added  into  his  retirement  while  the  Anchorage 
controller receives COLA. 

Today, the ‘‘rest of U.S.’’ locality rate is 11.72 percent and the nation’s top locality 
rate  (San  Francisco)  at  26.39  percent.  As  locality  rates  continue  to  progressively 
grow  so  will  the  disparity  in  retirement  benefits  between  the  two  systems.  Histori-
cally,  COLA  has  remained  flat  but  beginning  in  January  2006,  COLA  rate  reduc-
tions will become a reality. The resulting inequity causes actual and potential staff-
ing problems in non-foreign areas, especially for employees nearing retirement. 

OPM  has  stated  that  they  believe  the  COLA  program  should  be  phased  out  in 
favor  of  a  more  market-oriented  approach  to  pay.  The  FAA  enacted  locality  pay 
through FAA Order 3550.15 in March 1993. The Order states that, ‘‘The provisions 
are expected to aid work force stability and improve efforts in attracting the skilled 
and  diverse  workers  needed  to  sustain  the  tradition  of  FAA  achievement.’’  NATCA 
requests  your  support  in  implementing  a  transition  from  COLA  to  locality  pay—a 
transition that is fair to FAA employees and helps serve the government as a reten-
tion and recruiting tool for Alaska, the Pacific islands, and the Caribbean. 

Thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  testify  on  Alaskan  aviation  issues.  On  behalf 
of  NATCA  and  the  Alaskan  air  traffic  controllers,  we  look  forward  to  working  with 
you and your staffing to ensure that our air traffic control system remains the safest 
and most efficient in the world. I am happy to answer questions that you may have.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. 
Ms. Casanovas. 

STATEMENT OF KAREN E. CASANOVAS, EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR, ALASKA AIR CARRIERS ASSOCIATION 

Ms.  CASANOVAS.  Good  morning,  Chairman  Stevens.  I’m  Karen 
Casanovas,  the  Executive  Director  for  the  Alaska  Air  Carriers  As-
sociation.  And  we  are  here,  again,  to  educate  everyone  and  advo-
cate for aviation. And we take this as an honor to speak before you 
today  concerning  crucial  aviation  issues,  and  also,  since  we  know 
Alaska  aviation  travel  is  the  way  of  how  we  travel,  we’ll  address 
the  issues  and  challenges  facing  commercial  air  carriers  in  our 
state. 

As  a  pilot  yourself,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  know  that—and  under-
stand  that  there’s  a  wide  variety  of  services  provided  by  airlines 
and  transportation  companies  around  this  state.  We  have  the  sin-
gle  pilot  operator  to  the  turbo  prop,  to  the  rotorcraft,  even  to  the 
float  plane  operator.  And  since  there  is  a  wide  and  diverse  group 
of  carriers  performing  services  around  the  state  who  are  fulfilling 
essential  roles  in  Alaska’s  transportation  infrastructure,  many  are 
already strapped by rising fuel costs for security demands. 

Prior to my current management position, I served in several ca-
pacities  for  many  different  air  carriers  around  the  state  over  the 
last 30 years, and I, too, can attest to those varieties in the unique

aviation  companies  which  are  conducted  under  the  Federal  Avia-
tion Regulations Parts 121 and 135. 

Key  issues  certainly  are  utilization,  maintainability,  and  sched-
uling.  And  one  of  the  issues  we  have  found  recently  and  a  chal-
lenge  is  on  occasion  FAA’s  inability  to  have  manuals  reviewed, 
equipment improved, or maintenance checks. 

Operating conditions continue to be frustrating for airline opera-
tors,  and  something  must  be  done  to  stop  the  downward  spiral  in 
service  to  the  industry.  Solutions  might  include  an  evaluation  of 
pending manual approvals for aircraft certifications and a creation 
of  a  process  that  would  utilize  timelines  for  reviewing,  with  quan-
tifiable goals to meet those projects and complete them. 

In  some  locations  perhaps  financial  backing  would  be  needed  to 
staff  additional  positions.  In  Alaska  we’ve  been  very  fortunate 
under the leadership of FAA’s Regional Administrator Pat Poe, and 
also  Flight  Standards  Manager  John  Duncan.  They  have  been 
working  with  us  and  have  been  trying  to  come  up  with  solutions 
to meet the air carriers’ needs. 

Next,  however,  since  about  70  percent,  certainly,  of  our  commu-
nities are not connected to the outside world, or even to each other, 
our concerns are with proposed changes to 49 CFR Part 175 which 
we feel are not practical and certainly restrict the fundamental na-
ture of routine travel transportation in Alaska. 

The restriction to only one lighter to destinations where survival 
mandates  reliable  fire-starting  equipment  certainly  is  not  enough 
for  passengers  traveling  for  hunting,  fishing  or  any  wilderness  ac-
tivities,  or  anybody  conducting  surveying  or  construction  work. 
Carrying of more than one lighter on one’s person certainly can be 
accomplished  with  the  same  level  of  safety  when  a  passenger  is 
limited to just one lighter. 

Also,  many  rural  Alaskans  rely  on  subsistence  hunting  as  part 
of their lifestyle, and restricting them to 11 pounds of ammunition 
when traveling to remote locations and when there are no other op-
tions  to  purchase  additional  ammunition  is  not  practical.  This  ex-
isting exemption has demonstrated a need in air transportation for 
Alaskans  and  we  haven’t  seen  any  adverse  history  or  safety  con-
cerns previously. 

To  further  address  one  more  item  under  the  proposal  described, 
transportation  to  locations  where  there’s  no  phone  service  is  also 
a  concern  to  us.  Requiring  air  carrier  operators  to  employ  staff  to 
monitor  telephones  where  there  is  no  practical  solution  or  reason 
for  that,  we  would  also  suggest  language  exempting  this  require-
ment for small aircraft within the State of Alaska. 

Moreover, an obligation to remain in constant communication be-
tween  noncertificated  airports  and  the  pilot  in  command  is  not 
achievable, and this rule will likely be violated simply because com-
mercial carriers will not have the means to comply. 

Next  on  the  topic  of  the  proposed  National  Air  Tour  Safety 
Standards,  our  association  believes  the  objective  to  reduce  acci-
dents  in  the  sight-seeing  industry  will  affect  scheduled  operators 
who conduct air tours as part of their business. 

The changes will trickle down to other tourism-related commerce, 
as  well  as  impact  employees  of  those  companies  as  they  reduce 
their service or go out of business.

An estimated three quarters of our membership would see a fall-
out of between $15 and $18 million over a 10-year period. Air tours 
provide  higher  yields  for  certificate  holders  which  subsidize  the 
flat,  less  profitable  margins  of  Essential  Air  Service.  Certainly, 
businesses around the state, even those that have been in business 
for 22 years, under this proposed rule, there would be no guarantee 
that they would still remain in business. 

Since tourism is the second largest private-sector employer in the 
state, our proposal would be to continue to employ safety programs 
such  as  the  Capstone  and  Medallion  program.  And  results  in  im-
proved safety lie projects such as this, and also the implementation 
of  the  analysis  of  the  Wide  Area  Augmentation  System,  WASS,  to 
achieve  weather  reporting  and  also  training  for  navigational  aids, 
rather  than  more  regulatory  constraints.  We  feel  that  that  would 
be a better solution. 

We  would  recommend  that  this  NPRM  be  withdrawn,  and  fund-
ing continue for both Capstone as well as the Medallion programs. 
Mr.  Chairman,  the  Alaska  Air  Carriers  Association  appreciates 
your  co-sponsorship  with  Senator  Inouye  of  Senate  Bill  84,  which 
would  exempt  certain  sight-seeing  flights  from  taxes  on  air  trans-
portation. 

We  also  appreciate  your  continued  support  for  the  Medallion 
Foundation  and—truly  a  program  that  is  changing  the  culture  of 
aviation across the state. 

In order to continue to improve aviation safety, however, we feel 
we  need  additional  moneys  directed  toward  weather  access  and 
global  positioning  systems,  and  those  specific  projects  outlined  in 
the Alaska Aviation Coordination Council’s Strategic Plan. Regard-
ing  weather  accesses,  Mr.  Harding  mentioned  previously,  it  would 
be certainly a shame to have a situation in rural Alaska where an 
8-year-old  girl,  for  instance,  would  be  the  victim  of  a  domestic  vio-
lence  and  maybe  a  gunshot  wound  and  she’s  out  in  a  remote  loca-
tion,  and  because  pilots  don’t  have  access  to  that  weather,  they’re 
not able to provide medical need for her in a timely manner. 

Only  through  trust  and  collaboration  with  our  partners  in  the 
government  for  the  future  will  we  be  able  to  create  a  valuable, 
safer environment for passengers here in the State of Alaska. 

Thank  you  very  much  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  today.  Do 
not hesitate to call on the Alaska Air Carriers Association as a re-
source for future aviation issues. 

[The prepared statement of Ms. Casanovas follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF KAREN E. CASANOVAS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ALASKA AIR 

CARRIERS ASSOCIATION 

Good  morning  Chairman  Stevens  and  Members  of  the  Committee.  My  name  is 
Karen Casanovas and I am the Executive Director for the Alaska Air Carriers Asso-
ciation.  It  is  an  honor  to  speak  before  you  today  concerning  crucial  issues  facing 
aviation  commerce.  Since  air  travel  is  a  way  of  life  for  Alaskans,  I’ll  address  the 
issues and challenges facing commercial air carriers in our state. 

Our organization’s mission is to provide educational training, advocate for the in-
terests  of  aviation  in  the  public  process,  and  act  as  a  facilitator  of  aviation-related 
information.  Additionally,  we  provide  resources  for  insurance,  security,  safety,  air-
space,  or  weather  reporting  issues  and  act  as  a  conduit  between  government  and 
industry leaders. Our Association (AACA) was founded in 1966 and represents over 
160 commercial air carriers and businesses throughout the nation.

43

As a pilot yourself, Senator Stevens, you are aware of the wide variety of services 
provided by the aviation industry in our state. With a current grim economic situa-
tion  for  several  of  our  members,  the  Alaska  Air  Carriers  Association  membership 
firmly  believes  that  the  Federal  Government  officials  in  high  level  decision-making 
positions  should  support  aviation  businesses  not  hinder  them.  Air  carriers  per-
forming  services  around  the  state  are  fulfilling  essential  roles  in  Alaska’s  transpor-
tation  infrastructure  and  are  already  strapped  by  rising  fuel  costs  and  security  de-
mands. 

Prior to my current management position, I served in various capacities for Alas-
kan  air  carriers,  having  spent  over  30  years  in  this  industry,  and  can  attest  to  the 
existing widely diverse types of operations in Alaska. There are many different and 
unique aviation companies that are conducted under parts 121 and 135 of the Fed-
eral  Aviation  Regulations  (FARs).  They  are  single  engine  airplanes  to  turbo  prop 
equipped  aircraft  or  rotorcraft  and  float  plane  operators.  Some  current  proposals, 
however, would ignore these differences in operating requirements. 

Key  issues  for  air  carriers  are  throughput,  resource  utilization,  reliability,  avail-
ability, maintainability and scheduling. Without government staff to check-off man-
dated  federal  requirements,  an  air  carrier  is  not  able  to  utilize  their  aircraft.  This 
in turn causes lack of reliability to meet customer needs, and therefore affects their 
bottom line by not being able to maintain the demand for their services. 

One  challenge  facing  the  industry  today  is  the  FAA’s  unavailability  for  manual 
reviews, equipment approvals or maintenance checks. Operating conditions continue 
to be frustrating for airline operators and something must be done to stop the down-
ward  spiral  in  service  to  the  industry.  Solutions  include  an  evaluation  of  pending 
manual  approvals  or  aircraft  certifications,  and  the  creation  of  a  process  that  uti-
lizes  timelines  for  review  with  quantifiable  goals  for  completing  these  projects.  In 
some locations, financial backing is needed to staff additional positions. 

Next, since 70 percent of our communities are not connected to the outside world 
or even each other, our concerns are with certain proposed changes to 49 CFR Part 
175, which are not practical and accrue from the fundamental nature of routine air 
transportation in Alaska. 

The restriction of only one lighter to remote destinations where survival mandates 
reliable  fire-starting  equipment  is  not  enough  for  passengers  traveling  for  hunting, 
fishing,  wilderness  recreation,  surveying  or  construction  work.  Carrying  of  more 
than  one  lighter  on  one’s  person  can  be  accomplished  with  the  same  level  of  safety 
provided when a passenger is limited to only one lighter. 

Many rural Alaskans rely on subsistence hunting as part of their lifestyle and re-
stricting  them  to  11  pounds  of  ammunition  when  traveling  to  remote  locations  and 
where  there  are  no  regular  options  for  purchasing  small  arms  ammunition  is  not 
practical.  The  existing  exception  has  a  demonstrated  need  in  Alaskan  air  transpor-
tation with no adverse safety concerns or history. 

To  further  address  the  Research  and  Special  Programs  Administration  (RSPA) 
02–11654, previously described, transportation to locations where there is no phone 
service it is not realistic to require all air carriers to have personnel monitoring tele-
phones. Requiring these operators to employ staff to monitor phones is not practical 
and  we  suggest  language  exempting  this  requirement  for  small  aircraft  operated 
with the State of Alaska. Moreover, an obligation to remain in constant communica-
tion  between  a  non-certificated  airport  and  the  Pilot-in-Command  is  not  achievable 
and  this  rule  will  likely  be  violated  simply  because  commercial  operators  will  not 
have the means to comply. 

On  the  topic  of  the  proposed  National  Air  Tour  Safety  Standards,  (FAA–1998–
4521)  our  association  believes  the  objective  to  reduce  accidents  in  the  sight-seeing 
industry will affect scheduled operators who conduct air tours as part of their busi-
ness.  These  changes  will  trickle-down  to  other  tourism  related  commerce,  as  well 
as impact employees of these companies as they reduce service or go out of business. 
An estimated three quarters of our membership would see a fall out of between 15–
18  million  dollars  over  a  ten-year  period.  Air  tours  provide  higher  yields  for  certifi-
cate holders, which subsidize the flat, less profitable margins of essential air service. 
Since  tourism  is  the  second  largest  private  sector  employer  in  the  state,  our  pro-
posal  would  be  to  continue  to  increase  safety  through  programs  such  as  Capstone 
and  the  Medallion  Foundation.  Results  in  improved  safety  lie  in  projects  such  as 
further analysis of the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) to achieve weather 
reporting and training in use of navigational aids, rather than more regulatory con-
straints. We recommend that this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) be with-
drawn  and  that  funding  continue  for  both  the  Medallion  and  Capstone  programs. 
Senator Stevens, the Alaska Air Carriers Association appreciates your co-sponsor-
ship with Senator Inouye of Senate Bill 84, which would exempt certain sightseeing 
flights from taxes on air transportation. We also appreciate your continued support

of  the  Medallion  Foundation,  a  program  that  is  changing  the  culture  of  aviation  in 
Alaska.  In  order  to  continue  to  improve  aviation  safety,  however,  we  need  monies 
directed  toward  weather  access  and  Global  Positioning  Systems  (GPS)  and  those 
specific  projects  outlined  in  the  Alaska  Aviation  Coordination  Council’s  strategic 
plan. 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  comment  today  and  do  not  hesitate  to  call  on 

the AACA as a resource for aviation issues in the future.

The  CHAIRMAN.  That’s  a  very  fine  list  of  items  that  you’ve  cov-

ered. 

I’m  sorry  that  my  Co-Chairman,  Senator  Inouye  is  not  with  us. 
He had a personal problem that prevented him in coming to Alaska 
at this time. 

What  would  you  say  the  No.  1  priority  of  the  association  is  on 

this list of objectives? 

Ms.  CASANOVAS.  Providing  infrastructure  for  transportation 
throughout the state. Currently, we have about roughly 67 airports 
that  are  GPS-equipped,  and  if  we  could  have  the  additional  ap-
proximately 219 airports which are awaiting the GPS procedure de-
velopment,  I  think  that  would  certainly  be  a  case  where  we  could 
have some assistance. One hundred million over 4 years could cer-
tainly  provide  the  state  and  transition  us  from  what  we  see  as  in-
adequate  navigational  aids  right  now  to  providing  full  coverage 
and,  again,  through  the  Capstone  program,  we  can  then  have  the 
ADSB  and  the  other  portions  of  that  which  are  so  valuable  to  the 
carriers around the state. 

The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Plumb, you too had a nice long list of sugges-

tions and items to cover. What’s your No. 1 priority? 

Mr.  PLUMB.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  say  to  insure  we  have  our 
funding  for  our  cargo  entitlements  would  be  No.  1,  and  reinstate-
ment of the ATP program would be No. 2. 

The CHAIRMAN. Are we ready for this enormous plane that’s com-

ing here? This—what is it? 380? 

Mr.  PLUMB.  Yes,  sir.  We’ve  been  preparing  for  5  years.  And 
thanks  to  your  support  and  an  LOI  letter  of  intent  for  $51.2  mil-
lion,  we  have—we  have  a  plan  for  Group  6  routing  or  the  A380’s, 
more  commonly  known.  It  will  be  coming  down  the—what  is  now 
today  or  tomorrow  will  be  runway  7;  yesterday  or  a  week  ago  it 
was  6.  But  7  Right  will  be  a  Group  6  capable.  We  will  have  the 
capability  to  come  up  a  Kilo  taxiway  to  Romeo,  up  Romeo  that 
serves UPS and Federal Express, and the new taxiway Yankee will 
also  have.  So  we  will  have  a  complete  circuit  and  a  runway  for 
Group 6 aircraft. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  You’ve  really  been  very  complimentary  of  the 
Capstone and Medallion. We’re going to deal with Medallion again 
this  afternoon.  But  are  there  any  things  that  you  think  we  can  do 
in Washington to assist in the concept—and I’m talking to Harding 
right  now—the  concepts  of  either  Capstone  or  Medallion  to  carry 
them further? 

Mr. HARDING. We certainly appreciate all the support that you’ve 
given  us.  We  have  a  request  for  further  funding  on  the  Medallion; 
and, of course, that is always helpful. 

We’ve  talked  to  Mr.  Sabatini  about  taking  some  of  the  concepts 
that  we’re  using  in  the  Medallion  and  using  them  in  other  pro-
grams,  and  we  cannot  do  that  with  the  funding  that  we  get  for 
Alaska.  However,  that  funding  is  for  what  we’re  doing  in  Alaska.

But any of the programs that we develop we’re certainly willing to 
share with anyone else that you suggest. 

The CHAIRMAN. OK. 
Mr.  HARDING.  And  we  really  appreciate  your  continued  support. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. We’ll be back looking at that. 
And  talk  about  Medallion,  Mr.  Dennis.  Have  you  visited  other 
states?  Are  we  going  to  see  an  expansion  of  Medallion  in  other 
states as we have—we anticipate Capstone will go forward in other 
states? 

Mr.  DENNIS.  Senator,  we’ve  talked  about  that  with  several  other 

individuals, including Mr. Sabatini and Administrator Blakey. 

We’re looking more in relation to using the Medallion concept as 
a template and doing it as a regional basis, because it is a partner-
ship. It is something that needs to be done in concert with the FAA 
because  the  programs  do  impact  the  FAA.  And  we  need  their  sup-
port, as well as the local support, for the development of a program 
that is applicable to a local area. 

Florida  is  certainly  not  like  Alaska.  Texas,  Southern  California, 
each  one  has  unique  problems.  But  the  process,  the  concepts  and 
the templates, they are transferred. 

The CHAIRMAN. The concept really is this voluntary participation 
by the industry in areas and entities involved in the industry, get-
ting  together  to  try  and  find  out  if  they  could  have  a  different  ap-
proach  to  safety  and  work  it  out  with  the  FAA  so  that  you  could 
experiment  on  concepts  that  would  reduce  accidents  and  injuries, 
sufficiency in compliance with the FAA. Isn’t that the concept? 

Mr.  DENNIS.  That  is,  in  essence,  what  we’re  discussing,  sir,  yes. 
But  it’s  a  voluntary  program.  It’s  above  the  regulatory  require-
ments. It must meet the regulatory requirements, obviously, but it 
is over and above the regulatory requirements and it takes it a step 
above. Even from the—apart from the one RGA fire program. That 
also is a voluntary program which has its roots within the five-star 
program that initially was developed. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  How  much  time  has  it  taken  for  the  individual 
industry  participants  to  really  work  out  the  Medallion?  What’s 
been the workflow of the voluntary commitment of time? 

Mr.  DENNIS.  That  would  depend,  sir,  entirely  upon  the  operator. 
And  recognizing  that  we  have  carriers,  we  have  66  different  car-
riers  within  the  program  right  now,  and  they  range  in  complexity 
from Alaska Airlines and PenAir, Frontier Flying and a number of 
larger  carriers,  down  to  single-pilot  operations.  Single-pilot  oper-
ation,  quite  obviously,  it’s  more  onerous  on  them  because  of  their 
particular  workload  in  just  running  their  business.  So  we’re  modi-
fying,  that’s  why  I  mentioned  that  this  is  developed  and  we  have 
this one-on-one concept where we do go out and work with the op-
erator  and  try  to  take  the  burden  off  of  them,  we’ve  tried  to  meet 
the  requirements  that  have  been  set  forth  by  us  in  our  Memo-
randum of Agreement with the FAA. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  Mr.  Thompson,  I  think  as  Chairman  of  Com-
merce  I’m  spending  more  time  now  on  the  question  of  the  future 
airways  for  the  United  States,  airways  management,  than  I  ever 
dreamt  I  would.  We’re  coming  into  a  new  era  with  regard  to  spac-
ing,  with  regard  to  the  type  of  equipment  we’re  using  and  to  the 
whole system of integration almost on an automatic basis.

When  we  look  at  this—I  don’t  know  how  to  say  this  without 
sounding  a  little  negative,  but  I  was  initially  approached  by  your 
organization  to  oppose  Capstone  all  together.  Now  your  testimony 
is  that  you’re  prepared  to  accept  it,  but  you  want  to  be  more  in-
volved  from  a  controller  activity  to  sort  of  regulated.  Am  I  mis-
understanding? 

Mr. THOMPSON. I don’t think that—yeah, I don’t think you’re di-
rectly  getting  me  on  that  point.  I  can’t  say  what  the  Capstone  ini-
tially  started,  what  the  policy  was.  I’m  not  aware  of—I’ve  been  a 
regional vice president for NATCA up here for almost 8 years. And 
we’ve  always  supported  the  concept—again,  when  we  look  at  it 
from  an  APC  perspective  there’s  two  pieces  of  Capstone:  There’s 
the VFR aspect, which the people—gentleman in here have all tes-
tified.  It  works  fabulous  from  my  understanding  of  it.  It’s  an  in-
credible tool, video map and such. 

Then  there’s  the  air  traffic  control  aspect.  Since  we’re  talking 
about  moving  IFR  airplanes  and  separating  them  with  the  same 
use  of  radar,  which  we  are,  it’s  a  fabulous  tool.  But  it  has  to  work 
seamlessly  with  the  radar,  and  controllers  have  to  be  able  to  have 
the communication systems in place. In Bethel that’s not a problem 
because  the  terrain  is  flat,  we  can  speak  to  the  pilots.  As  you  go 
to  Southeast  in  Juneau,  some  of  these  low-altitude  routes  that 
some  of  the  people  have  testified  here  today,  I’m  aware  are  in 
place.  But  if  they  fly  IFR  at  2,000  feet  down  the  fjords  of  South-
east, today there’s no communication system for the air traffic con-
troller to speak to them if there’s an issue or if they’re needed to—
missed  approach  or  such.  I  understand  there’s  methods  to  get 
there, and we want to get there. NATCA absolutely does. 

I firmly believe 100 percent that providing approach control serv-
ices  to  Bethel  will  be  fabulous  to  the  users  and  the  public.  Once 
we  can  sequence  the  special  VFR  with  the  IFR—Juneau  same 
thing,  once  we  can  see  to  the  ground  with  Capstone  technology, 
and  along  with  multilateration,  I  think  it’s  going  to  be  a  fabulous 
tool.  What  we’re  really  asking  for  is  that  the  agency  engage  with 
us in those discussions. 

The  CHAIRMAN.  With  the  advent  of  the  new  small  jet,  business 
jet, personal jet, we’re all familiar with them, they’re going to be—
I call them the mosquito fleet is coming in. Small, six to nine pas-
sengers,  a  jet,  probably  faster  than  before,  very  efficient.  Made  of 
composite materials. Lighter weight. And fast—not only faster, but 
really  smaller  so  it’s  going  to  be  a  very  interesting  challenge.  I 
think  we  have  to  work  together  to  make  sure  that  that  system  we 
can  transition  into  a  new  system  without  delays,  because,  very 
clearly,  10  years  from  now,  the  estimate  is  there  will  be  twice  as 
many aircraft in the airway system.

I  look  forward  to  working  with  you.  I  think  we  all  have  to  work 

I’m reminded a friend of mine told me of a Pacific northern pilot 
that  flew  into  Juneau  for  year  after  year  after  year.  And  one  day 
he flew in and it was clear and quit. 

[Laughter.] 
The  CHAIRMAN.  Seeing  is  believing.  That  Capstone  system  on  a 
flight  into  Juneau,  I’ve  also  flown  in  with  that.  It  makes  one  tre-
mendous difference. I hope we can incorporate all of these new ad-

all of you. We’ll review all the comments you’ve made.

These hearings—we’d hoped we would have more Senators here, 
but  the  4th  of  July  is  still  a  problem  getting  other  Senators  to 
come.  But  a  copy  of  this  record  will  be  provided  to  every  Member 
of  our  Committee  and  to  those  committees  that  have  any  intersec-
tion  with  the  problems  we’ve  discussed.  For  instance,  the  Finance 
Committee and others. 

And  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  as  we  go  through  the 
year  in  terms  of  the  legislation  before  our  Committee  that  will  af-
fect us all. 

Thank you very much. 
[Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the Committee adjourned.]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PHIL BROWN, DIRECTOR, ALASKA REGION, NATIONAL 

ASSOCIATION OF AIR TRAFFIC SPECIALISTS (NAATS) 

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to 
review  with  you  today  the  National  Association  of  Air  Traffic  Specialists  (NAATS) 
assessment of future challenges facing the Alaska aviation community. Much of our 
work over the last several years has continued to focus on maintaining equal or bet-
ter service for Alaska’s flying public. The crucial services provided by Flight Service 
Station (FSS) personnel are essential to aviation in Alaska. Likewise, air traffic con-
trol and all of its associated functions in the FSS are government responsibilities—
especially  in  Alaska  where  aviation  is  often  the  only  lifeline  for  our  communities. 
I will focus my remarks today on these subjects. 

The  unique  environment  of  Alaska  means  that  our  aviation  community  warrants 
increased  attention.  National  aviation  guidelines  and  evaluation  formulas  need  to 
be continually adjusted to work in our great State so that Alaska aviation does not 
suffer under a one-size fits all policy. Mr. Chairman, when tough issues arise in the 
Senate, your well-known motto has always been, ‘‘Do what’s best for Alaska.’’ There 
is  no  doubt  that  much  of  the  cutting  edge  technology  that  you  are  being  briefed  on 
today  will  serve  Alaska  aviation  well  in  the  near  and  distant  future.  Having  said 
that,  one  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  basic  foundation  this  wonderful  technology  is 
being  built  upon.  Clearly,  there  is  nothing  that  replaces  the  Flight  Service  Station 
person  on  the  ground  providing  often  life-saving  assistance  to  Alaska’s  bush  pilots, 
air carriers, military pilots and recreation flyers. Mr. Chairman, well-trained, expe-
rienced human capital is the mortar holding this foundation together and maintain-
ing this professional federal workforce is without a doubt, ‘‘what is best for Alaska.’’
Mr.  Chairman,  the  dedicated  men  and  women  who  make  up  the  federal  FSS 
workforce  are  the  integral  key  to  saving  lives  and  maintaining  the  safest  Alaska 
aviation  infrastructure  possible.  The  Flight  Service  Station  employees  are  often  re-
ferred  to  as  the  ‘‘other  controllers.’’  Air  traffic  control  conjures  up  images  of  dimly 
lit  rooms,  lined  with  rows  of  dark  screens,  displaying  a  myriad  of  blips  and  lines. 
Each scope monitored by passionate individuals devoted to keeping apart an endless 
stream  of  traffic,  issuing  precise  instructions,  carefully  formulated  to  protect  the 
thousands of lives represented by the targets flowing in every direction. This is the 
image  most  people  have  of  the  dedicated  individuals  who  monitor  the  skies  for  po-
tential conflict. No less dedicated, yet almost unknown outside the aviation commu-
nity, are the ‘‘other controllers.’’ Those air traffic control specialists devoted to help-
ing  pilots  avoid  the  innumerable  weather  phenomena  that  are  just  as  hazardous  to 
aviation safety as other traffic. These, Mr. Chairman, are the individuals who work 
in  the  Flight  Service  Stations  (FSS)  across  the  nation;  this  workforce  is  the  mortar 
that bonds the foundation of the safest aviation infrastructure in the world. Weath-
er is a factor in an overwhelming majority of aviation accidents. Even with advances 
in  technology,  rapidly  changing  weather  patterns  still  present  a  significant  danger 
to flight safety. Flight Service Station professionals, working in highly technical en-
vironments, scan a kaleidoscope of weather charts and constantly updating weather 
data  assisting  pilots,  both  before  and  during  flight  to  avoid  potential  dangers.  No-
where  else  in  the  nation  are  these  potential  weather  dangers  more  prevalent  than 
in  Alaska  where  pilots  navigate  airspace  one-fifth  the  size  of  the  entire  United 
States and half of the country’s coastline. 

A  major  challenge  facing  the  Alaska  aviation  community  is  maintaining  this  in-
valuable  human  capital  in  the  Federal  Flight  Service  Stations  throughout  our  last 
frontier.  While  the  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  continues  to  struggle 
with reorganization and restructure in the new Air Traffic Organization (ATO), the 
privatization/outsourcing  juggernaut  commonly  known  as  ‘‘A–76’’  continues  to  move 
forward. Mr. Chairman, this ill-advised and misguided ‘‘A–76’’ initiative places avia-
tion  safety  in  the  hands  of  a  ‘‘lowest  bidder.’’  We  believe  this  presents  a  clear  and 
present  danger  to  aviation  safety  in  Alaska.  While  federal  FSS  air  traffic  control 
specialists in Alaska are currently exempt from this privatization/outsourcing initia-

tive,  there  is  no  reasonable  expectation  or  mandate  preventing  FAA  officials  from 
expanding their privatization efforts into our great state.

Currently,  the  entire  FSS  community  outside  Alaska  is  in  immediate  danger  of 
losing  their  Federal  Government  careers.  Many  of  these  dedicated  men  and  women 
started their careers in the military and have spent a lifetime serving their country 
in  the  federal  service.  Now,  many  are  in  danger  of  losing  their  health  and  retire-
ment benefits only months and in some cases days away from reaching their retire-
ment goals. Mr. Chairman, it is simply wrong to toss aside employees and their fam-
ilies  in  this  fashion.  I  respectfully  encourage  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  take  a  close, 
in-depth look at this entire outsourcing/privatization effort of America’s FAA Flight 
Service Stations. We are certain that the inaccurate cost-savings figures being tout-
ed by FAA representatives, the empty promises of ‘‘soft landings’’ for federal employ-
ees  and  the  outright  raiding  of  government  employee  pensions  will  shock  and  dis-
may you. 

Mr.  Chairman,  a  number  of  years  ago  when  the  FAA  was  closing  down  and  con-
solidating Flight Service Stations throughout Alaska the flying public rose up in op-
position.  Hearing  this  public  outcry,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  asked  a  question  that  still 
echoes through the halls of the FAA today, ‘‘What don’t you understand about equal 
or  better  service?’’  Your  wise  and  insightful  actions  then  laid  the  foundation  for 
keeping  our  remote  Flight  Service  Stations  in  Alaska  open  and  lead  to  the  develop 
of  an  Alaska  Rotation  Plan  that  addressed  difficult  staffing  issues.  Unfortunately, 
the  Alaska  Rotation  Plan  and  our  Alaska  remote  Flight  Service  Stations  are  under 
attack by FAA management once again. Absent any plausible rationale or cost-sav-
ings projections that have been shared with us, FAA management is systematically 
dismantling the Alaska Rotation Plan. Moreover, even as we speak today, plans are 
being  executed  to  place  kiosk  stations  at  remote  Alaska  locations  that  will  eventu-
ally  replace  the  remote  FSS.  Mr.  Chairman,  this  ‘‘kiosk  concept’’  of  self-serve  air 
traffic  control  is  the  same  plan  that  prompted  your  now  infamous  statement  over 
12 years ago . . .‘‘What don’t you understand about equal or better service.’’ What’s 
more disturbing Mr. Chairman is that it appears to be some of the same individuals 
revisiting this concept now that were involved then. History, truly does repeat itself 
and we respectfully request that you follow this matter closely. Replacing the expe-
rienced  Flight  Service  Station  professionals  on  the  ground  at  remote  locations  with 
self-serve kiosks simply does not equate to ‘‘equal or better service.’’

In  conclusion,  I  thank  you  today  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee 
for your time and for holding these hearings. Clearly, we have major challenges fac-
ing  the  Alaska  aviation  community.  While  finding  a  balance  between  cost-effective-
ness, equal or better service and aviation safety is a daunting task; it is a task that 
we  can  and  must  achieve  together.  The  National  Association  of  Air  Traffic  Special-
ists  sees  this  as  an  important  and  dynamic  time  in  Alaska  aviation  history  and  we 
stand  ready,  willing  and  able  to  work  in  collaboration  with  the  FAA  and  the  avia-
tion community toward achieving these goals.
