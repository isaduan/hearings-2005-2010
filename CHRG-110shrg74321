CHARTING  THE  COURSE  FOR 

REAUTHORIZATION 

THURSDAY,  APRIL  24,  2008 

SUBCOMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND 
INNOVATION, 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

U.S. SENATE, 

The  Subcommittee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  2:49  p.m.  in  room 
253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. John Kerry, Chairman of 
the Subcommittee, presiding. 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS 

Senator  KERRY.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order.  Thank  you  all 
very  much.  I  apologize  for  being  a  little  bit  late.  I  was  voting  on 
the tail end there. We thank our witnesses for their patience. We’re 
going to try to roll right along here. 

This issue couldn’t be more timely as we look forward to the next 
generation  of  nanotechnology  breakthroughs.  In  the  8  years  since 
President Clinton first created the National Nanotechnology Initia-
tive,  it’s  really  become  clear  that  our  ability  to  manipulate,  engi-
neer,  and  manufacture  nanoparticles  provides  an  unlimited  poten-
tial for innovation and growth throughout the economy. 

In  2006,  an  estimated  $50  billion  in  products  worldwide  incor-
porated some form of nanotechnology and that figure has been pro-
jected by some to reach about 2.6 trillion over the next 8 years. Sci-
entists  are  using  this  technology  to  create  advanced  materials  and 
systems that will obviously improve our way of life and also revolu-
tionize the very concepts of size and scale. 

The  nanotechnology  revolution  is  occurring  across  all  sectors.  In 
Massachusetts, my friend Dr. Robert Linares started a company in 
his  garage  after  discovering  a  way  to  use  nanotechnology  to  turn 
carbon  powder  into  diamonds.  I  have  visited  one  of  Dr.  Linares’s 
facilities  and  actually  watched  the  team  that  has  worked  to  build 
a  diamond  atom  by  atom.  His  company,  Apollo  Diamond,  is  cur-
rently  working  with  the  Defense  Department  to  develop  related 
technologies  that  will  reduce  collateral  damage,  protect  soldiers 
and  citizens,  and  improve  the  capabilities  of  our  military  aircraft. 
We  also  know  that  there’s  extraordinary  potential  for  nanotech-
nology and life sciences and we’ll hear later this afternoon from Dr. 
Goel  who  is  CEO  of  Nanobiosym  Diagnostics.  Dr.  Goel’s  company

is  creating  portable  nanotechnology-enabled  devices  that  can  rap-
idly  and  accurately  provide  patients  with  real-time  access  to  med-
ical  diagnostic  information.  Even  better,  she’s  working  to  perfect 
this technology in Medford, Massachusetts, a little parochialism. 

As visionaries and innovators, such as Dr. Linares and Dr. Goel, 
work  to  harness  this  potential,  the  Federal  Government  does  have 
a critical role to play. As we look toward reauthorizing the National 
Nanotechnology  Initiative  at  the  end  of  this  Fiscal  Year,  there  are 
issues  and  questions  that  have  to  be  addressed  so  we  can  stay  out 
in front of our global competitors, most of whom are betting big on 
nanotechnology right now. 

We also have a responsibility to make sure we’re dedicating suffi-
cient  resources  toward  researching  the  environmental  health  and 
safety impacts of these particles. 

The  Chairman  of  the  Committee  asked  for  a  GAO  report  to  as-
sess  just  how  much  of  a  priority  is  being  placed  on  EHS  research 
across  the  25  agencies  that  administer  the  National  Nanotechnol-
ogy Initiative. GAO’s response is troubling. 

In  2006,  just  3  percent  of  the  $1.3  billion  designated  for  the  Na-
tional Nanotechnology Initiative was used to further EHS research. 
Even  that  statistic  is  a  little  misleading  because,  according  to  the 
Controller General, the agencies are using a faulty reporting struc-
ture  and  are  not  receiving  appropriate  guidance  for  how  to  appor-
tion funding across multiple topics. 

Funding  for  EHS  research  will  be  a  top  priority  as  we  move  for-
ward  with  this  reauthorization  process.  We  need  to  ensure  a  well- 
coordinated,  well-funded  governmentwide  approach  to  performing 
the  research  that  will  tell  us  whether  these  particles  are  safe  to 
work around, whether they’re safe for the environment, and wheth-
er they’re safe for consumers once they reach the shelves. 

It’s  obviously  critical  to  do  that  research  upfront  so  we’re  not 

asking what went wrong a hundred years from now. 

I  look  forward  to  discussion  with  these  panels  and  working  with 
my  colleagues  on  the  Subcommittee,  including  Senator  Pryor,  with 
whom I chair the High-Tech Task Force, to draft a reauthorization 
proposal.  I  hope  our  discussion  today  will  be  instructive  with  re-
spect to that. 

Senator Stevens? 

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I’m 
delighted  you’re  holding  this  hearing  today  on  nanotechnology  and 
the reauthorization of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. 

Nanotechnology  is  fascinating  and  revolutionary  in  many  ways 
and it has the potential to change and improve our lives. I do think 
we  all  think  about  it  from  the  golf  course  to  the  emergency  room. 
Nanoscience is developing novel materials and devices and systems 
that  open  up  new  avenues  of  science  and  engineering  and  control-
ling  matter  at  the  size  of  1,000ths  of  the  diameter  of  the  human 
hair creates really an interest in the public and everyone concerned 
with it. I think it is such an amazing new area, that it is, as I said, 
just plain fascinating to me.

As this nanotechnology evolves, safety becomes the topic of great 
interest  and  I  think  there  appears  to  be  very  little  evidence  so  far 
that  nanotechnology  is  creating  any  serious  dangers  to  our  Nation 
or is unsafe. On the contrary, I’m told medicine has used nanopar-
ticles for at least 25 years in therapeutic medicines. Magnetic reso-
nance  imaging  tests  already  employ  nanotechnology  and  they’ve 
not revealed any demonstrable negative impacts on human health. 
So  in  the  absence  of  that,  I  hope  that  Congress  and  the  Federal 
Government  will  not,  as  policymakers  or  administrators,  overesti-
mate our role and we will conduct ourselves in the way to support 
the  research  and  avoid  imposing  additional  regulatory  regimes  on 
this  developing  field  of  science,  unless  we’re  convinced  that  addi-
tional regulations is really warranted. 

Mr. President—Mr. Chairman, I have to leave—— 
Senator KERRY. I like Mr. President. It’s OK. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator KERRY. Even if it’s very fleeting. 
Senator  STEVENS.  I  had  the  privilege  of  being  President  of  the 

Senate for 4 years, so I understand what you’re saying. 

Chairman  of  the  Committee,  Senator  Inouye  and  I  have  an  ap-
pointment,  however,  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Foreign  Affairs 
Committee of the National Peoples Congress in China, very impor-
tant meeting, so I’ll have to leave soon. 

I  want  to  give  my  apologies  to  my  great  friend  Jim  Heath  who’s 
here and look forward to seeing Jim. I hope he’ll stop by the office 
before he leaves today. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator  KERRY.  Thanks  so  much,  Senator  Stevens,  and  thank 
you for your interest in this. We know that you have a huge ability 
to help make the right things happen on this. this. So we really ap-
preciate your interest in it and participation. 

So  Mr.  Russell,  thank  you,  Director,  for  being  here.  We  appre-
ciate  that,  and  Mr.  Robinson,  why  don’t  you  guys  lead  off?  If  you 
can summarize your statements in about 5 minutes, your full state-
ments  will  be  placed  in  the  record  as  if  read  in  full,  so  don’t  fear 
that  anything  will  be  left  out  of  the  record,  and  we’ll  have  a  little 
more chance to explore it with the panels. 

Thank you. 

STATEMENT OF AMBASSADOR RICHARD M. RUSSELL, 
ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR 

TECHNOLOGY, OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 

POLICY, EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  Terrific.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Kerry  and  Vice 
Chairman  Stevens,  and  when  the  rest  of  the  members  of  the  Sub-
committee come, thank them as well. 

I’m  very  pleased  to  appear  here  before  you  to  discuss  the  Na-
tional  Nanotechnology  Initiative  and  issues  associated  with  its  up-
coming reauthorization. 

First of all, I’d like to thank the Committee on behalf of the Ad-
ministration and the NNI for its bipartisan support of nanotechnol-
ogy  research.  NNI  is  truly  an  example  of  the  successful  bipartisan 
effort  to  promote  one  of  the  most  important  areas  of  science  and 
technology  currently  being  sponsored  by  the  Federal  Government.

rize. 

The NNI was first established during the last year of the Clinton 
Administration.  With  the  support  of  Congress  and  the  Bush  Ad-
ministration, the program has more than tripled in scale, a perma-
nent coordinating office has been established and authorizing legis-
lation  passed  and  signed  into  law.  The  Committee  deserves  great 
credit for its longstanding support of the program. 

I have submitted detailed written testimony which I will summa-

NNI  is  built  on  the  voluntary  association  of  25  Federal  agencies 
that  have  activities  and  interests  related  to  nanoscale  science  and 
technology. The Administration believes the organization, structure 
and  management  of  the  NNI  is  appropriate  and  effective  and,  ac-
cordingly,  I  urge  Congress  to  proceed  with  caution  in  considering 
any fundamental changes to the structure. 

In  Fiscal  Year  2009,  the  Administration  has  requested  $1.5  bil-
lion for the program. The NNI now represents a cumulative invest-
ment  of  almost  $10  billion.  The  NNI  recently  released  an  updated 
strategic  plan  that  outlines  the  following  four  basic  goals  for  the 
initiative. 

Goal 1. Advanced a world class nanotechnology research and de-

velopment program. 

The NNI has funded thousands of individual R&D projects since 
its inception, contributing to U.S. world leadership in nanotechnol-
ogy. While identifying meaningful metrics for evaluating U.S. glob-
al  leadership  in  nanotechnology  is  challenging,  by  many  of  the 
measures  that  we  do  have  available,  the  United  States  continues 
to  lead  in  both  basic  and  applied  research,  nanoscale  science  and 
technology.  While  the  U.S.  leads  in  many  important  statistics,  the 
rest of the world is hard on our heels. 

In  terms  of  both  funding  and  research  results,  Europe,  Asia  and 
now  Russia  are  matching  and  in  some  cases  exceeding  our  nano-
funding and are hoping to take over the leadership role. 

Goal  2.  Foster  the  transfer  of  new  technologies  into  products  for 

commercial and public benefit. 

The  NNI  has  put  in  place  a  number  of  efforts  targeted  to  en-
hance  the  transfer  of  research  results  into  practical  applications 
and  commercialization.  For  example,  there  are  over  60  inter-
disciplinary research centers and user facilities around the country 
which  provide  collaborative  environments  where  researchers  from 
academia  and  industry  can  interact,  increasing  the  likelihood  of 
technology transfer. 

Goal 3. Develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled work 
force, and support infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnol-
ogy. 

Education  is  among  the  chief  objectives  of  the  NNI-funded  uni-
versity research. In addition, there are numerous specific programs 
targeted at K through 12 education. 

Goal  4.  Support  responsible  development  of  nanotechnology, 
something,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  were  just  alluding  to.  As  potential 
environment,  health  and  safety  concerns  about  nanotechnology 
begin to emerge in the early years of the initiative, an interagency 
EHS working group was formed. 

In  December  2004,  the  NNI  released  a  strategic  plan  calling  out 
EHS  research  for  special  attention.  In  September  2006,  the  EHS 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:11 May 24, 2012 Jkt 074321 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\DOCS\74321.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

Research  Needs  Report  was  completed.  It  identified  75  research 
needs  within  five  general  categories  of  EHS  research.  Most  re-
cently,  in  February  2008,  a  comprehensive  EHS  strategy  was  re-
leased.  In  addition,  the  National  Research  Council  is  now  under 
contract to assess the EHS strategy. 

The  Federal  Government  needs  to  ensure  that  nano-EHS  re-
search  is  adequately  addressed.  To  this  end,  the  NNI  has  system-
atically:  (1)  identified  research  needs,  (2)  prioritized  those  needs, 
(3)  developed  an  associated  inventory  from  which  a  gap  analysis 
can  be  performed,  and  (4)  developed  a  strategy  for  addressing  and 
prioritizing the needs that are not currently being addressed. 

The Administration believes this systematic approach is the right 
way to address EHS research needs. This systematic approach has 
led  to  EHS  funding  being  more  than  doubled  since  Fiscal  Year 
2005,  from  $35  million  to  $76  million  in  the  Fiscal  2009  request, 
a  growth  rate  significantly  faster  than  the  overall  growth  than 
NNI. 

As  GAO  points  out  in  its  report  on  NNI’s  EHS  research,  and  I 
quote,  ‘‘Some  environmental  and  industry  groups  have  advocated 
for a more top-down and directed approach for setting and funding 
Federal nanotechnology research priorities. However, such a struc-
ture  and  approach  is  generally  inconsistent  with  the  historical  ap-
proaches  used  to  set  Federal  research  priorities  and  may  be  dif-
ficult to implement.’’ 

We  agree,  and  the  Administration  does  not  support  establishing 

an arbitrary top-down EHS set-aside. 

In  conclusion,  Mr.  Chairman,  the  NNI  has  been  and  remains  a 
highly  successful  enterprise,  due  in  large  part  to  the  unparalleled 
interagency  coordination  and  collaboration  which  in  turn  has  been 
effective  because  of  a  voluntary  bottom-up  nature  in  which  all  the 
agencies that participate benefit. 

I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Committee  as  it  considers 

how to improve upon the successful program. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Russell follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF AMBASSADOR RICHARD M.  RUSSELL,  ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR 
AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR TECHNOLOGY,  OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
POLICY, EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 

I. Introduction 

Chairman  Kerry,  Ranking  Member  Ensign  and  members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I 
am  pleased  to  appear  before  you  to  discuss  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative 
(NNI) and issues associated with its upcoming reauthorization. First of all, I would 
like  to  thank  this  Committee  on  behalf  of  the  Administration  and  the  NNI  for  its 
bipartisan  support  for  nanotechnology  research,  as  well  as  for  the  good  working  re-
lationship the Committee has established with our office and the representatives of 
the NNI. 

In  my  testimony  today,  I  would  like  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  NNI  organiza-
tion, activities, and funding, and communicate the Administration’s policy priorities 
with  respect  to  the  upcoming  reauthorization  of  the  program,  in  the  context  of  the 
NNI’s  newly  updated  strategic  plan.1 I  also  want  to  go  into  particular  detail  on 
nanotechnology-related environmental, health, and safety (EHS) issues. 

Established  in  2000  to  coordinate  Federal  nanotechnology  research  and  develop-
ment  (R&D),  the  NNI  is  built  on  the  voluntary  association  of  25  Federal  agencies 
that  have  activities  and  interests  related  to  nanoscale  science  and  technology.  The 
management  of  the  NNI  is  led  by  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy

(OSTP),  which  oversees  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)  and 
the  National  Nanotechnology  Coordination  Office  (NNCO).  The  participating  agen-
cies  of  the  NSTC’s  Subcommittee  on  Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering,  and  Tech-
nology  (NSET)  coordinates  the  NNCO.  The  NNCO  provides  technical  and  adminis-
trative  support  to  the  NSET  Subcommittee,  serves  as  a  central  point  of  contact  for 
Federal  nanotechnology  R&D  activities,  and  provides  public  outreach  on  behalf  of 
the NNI. By providing a locus for communication, cooperation, and collaboration the 
NNI provides effective avenues for each individual agency to leverage the resources 
and expertise of all participating agencies. 

The NNI has become a successful model for interagency cooperation and coordina-
tion  in  science  and  technology.  From  the  broader  perspective  of  the  U.S.  Govern-
ment  as  a  whole,  this  cooperation  and  coordination  creates  synergy  that  makes  the 
NNI  greater  than  the  sum  of  its  parts.  The  coordination  in  addressing  potential 
EHS  implications  of  nanotechnology  has  been  particularly  strong,  and  successful: 
never before have regulatory and research agencies successfully communicated so ef-
fectively on a topic of common interest, and among such a large number of agencies. 
Through the NNI the member agencies have been working hard to understand—and 
to think strategically about—nanotechnology-related EHS issues in a systematic, co-
ordinated fashion. 

The  NNI  enterprise  does  come  with  some  ‘‘overhead’’  expenses.  As  long  as  those 
expenses are relatively modest, the voluntary interagency cooperation that has been 
the  hallmark  of  the  NNI  will  continue.  But  in  an  era  when  so-called  ‘‘discretionary 
funding’’ accounts in the Federal budget, including R&D funding, are under extreme 
pressure,  we  need  to  be  particularly  careful  not  to  increase  the  overhead  expenses 
unduly. These expenses include not just the budget for the NNCO, but also the per-
sonnel costs at each of the agencies associated with managing a complex interagency 
coordinated effort like this. 

The  Administration  believes  the  organization,  structure,  and  management  of  the 
NNI  is  appropriate  and  effective,  and  accordingly  I  urge  Congress  to  proceed  with 
caution in considering any fundamental changes in this area. 
II. Overview and Status of NNI Goals 

The  NNI  now  represents  a  cumulative  investment  of  almost  $10  billion  since  its 
inception  in  Fiscal  Year  2001,  including  the  President’s  requested  NNI  budget  for 
Fiscal Year 2009. The requested investment for 2009 of $1.5 billion and the substan-
tial growth in this investment since 2001 reflects a shared appreciation by both this 
Administration  and  Congress  of  the  potential  for  nanoscale  science  and  technology 
R&D.  Managed  under  the  auspices  of  the  NNI,  these  investments  will  expand  our 
fundamental  knowledge  of  this  field  and  make  important  contributions  to  national 
priorities  such  as  economic  competitiveness,  homeland  and  national  security,  and 
public  health.  A  summary  of  the  FY  2009  NNI  Budget  request  broken  down  by 
agency and program component area is attached in Appendix I. 

The  NNI  recently  released  an  updated  strategic  plan  that  outlines  the  following 

four basic goals for the initiative: 

Goal 1: Advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development program. 
Toward this goal, the NNI has funded thousands of individual R&D projects since 
its  inception,  contributing  to  U.S.  world  leadership  in  nanotechnology.  As  indicated 
in  the  recently  released  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Technology 
(PCAST)  review  of  the  NNI,2 identifying  meaningful  metrics  for  evaluating  U.S. 
global  leadership  in  nanotechnology  is  challenging.  But  by  many  of  the  measures 
that  we  do  have  available,  the  United  States  continues  to  lead  in  both  basic  and 
applied research in nanoscale science and technology. 

As  shown  in  the  PCAST  report,  U.S.-based  researchers  dominate  in  publication 
of  nanotechnology-related  papers  in  three  of  the  world’s  premier  scientific  journals, 
Science,  Nature,  and  Proceedings  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  rising  from 
about  60  percent  at  the  inception  of  the  NNI  in  2000  to  over  70  percent  in  2006. 
U.S. papers also are cited far more frequently in peer reviewed journal publications 
than are papers from any other country—another clear indicator of the ‘‘world-class’’ 
quality  of  U.S.  nanotechnology  research.  This  leadership  in  citations  has  also  been 
sustained over the initial years of the NNI, even while other nations have also sub-
stantially increased their investments in nanotechnology R&D. 

Finally,  and  perhaps  most  significantly,  U.S.  inventors  lead  the  world  by  far  in 
nanotechnology-enabled  patents,  including  patents  filed  in  three  or  more  inter-
national  patent  offices.  This  is  a  clear  indicator  of  leadership  in  nanotechnology  in-
tellectual  property,  which  we  would  expect  to  ultimately  translate  into  leadership 
in commercialization of nanotechnology-based products.

These  are  all  strong  indicators  that  the  United  States  is  indeed  advancing  a 
world-class nanotechnology research and development program, in large part under 
the  auspices  of  the  NNI.  However,  we  must  not  be  complacent  in  evaluating  our 
international  competitiveness  in  nanotechnology.  Also  as  indicated  in  the  new 
PCAST  report,  Europe  as  a  whole  leads  the  world  in  nanotechnology  publications 
in the Science Citation Index (SCI) data base, and China and other Asian countries 
are rapidly gaining on the United States and Europe in SCI publications. Therefore 
we  must  continue  to  sustain  and  increase  our  strategic  investments  in  this  critical 
area of science and technology. 

Goal  2:  Foster  the  transfer  of  new  technologies  into  products  for  commercial  and 

public benefit. 

The  NNI  has  put  in  place  a  number  of  efforts  targeted  to  enhance  the  transfer 
of  research  results  into  practical  applications  and  commercialization.  Examples  of 
successful  technology  transfer  efforts  under  the  NNI  are  included  in  Appendix  II. 
Specific  NNI  activities  supporting  this  technology  transfer/commercialization  goal 
include the following: 

• U.S.  leadership  in  nanotechnology  patenting,  an  essential  step  in  commer-
cialization. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is working hard to 
assure efficient and appropriate processing of nanotechnology-related patents by 
creating  a  nanotechnology  patent  cross  reference  collection,  including  patents 
and  patent  applications  spanning  the  wide  range  of  fields  of  science  and  engi-
neering that now involve nanoscale science and technology. USPTO is also con-
ducting  training  sessions  for  its  examiners  to  improve  their  understanding  of 
nanotechnology. 
• Agency-specific  programs  support  application  and  use  of  nanotechnology  (DOD, 
NASA,  NIH,  etc.).  For  example,  DOD  has  led  the  way  in  development  of  elec-
tronics  and  sensing  applications  of  nanotechnology,  as  well  as  in  development 
and  deployment  of  specialized  coatings,  e.g.,  to  reduce  wear  and  maintenance 
costs  on  moving  parts  in  the  Navy  fleet.  NASA  has  led  in  the  development  of 
nanotechnology-enabled sensors. NIH has led in funding the development of nu-
merous biomedical applications of nanotechnology, including a number of prom-
ising novel approaches for early detection and treatment of cancer. 
• Industry  liaison  groups  and  public/private  partnerships.  These  groups  assist  in 
exchanging  information  on  NNI  research  activities  and  industry  needs  and  in 
leveraging  funds  for  cooperative  R&D.  Industry  liaison  groups  with  the  elec-
tronics,  forest  products,  and  chemical  industries,  and  with  the  industrial  re-
search  management  community,  are  continuing,  while  formation  of  comparable 
groups  with  other  sectors  (e.g.,  the  construction  industry)  is  under  consider-
ation. One successful example is the collaboration between NSF, NIST, and the 
industry-led Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI), where industry and gov-
ernment  representatives  collaborate  in  setting  long-term  research  priorities  for 
nanoelectronics,  reviewing  proposals  and  supporting  pre-competitive  research. 
In  another  example,  NIH  is  formulating  a  ‘‘NanoHealth  Enterprise,’’  which  is 
envisioned  as  a  partnership  with  other  Federal  agencies,  private  industry,  and 
international  partners  to  address  research  needs  for  safe  development  of 
nanoscale materials and devices. 
• NNI support for the development of international standards for nanotechnology. 
Such standards are critical to future commercialization activities. NNCO Direc-
tor  Clayton  Teague  chairs  the  U.S.  Technical  Advisory  Group  (TAG)  to  the 
International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  Technical  Committee  on 
Nanotechnologies  (ISO  TC  229).  NNI  agencies  have  provided  initial  financial 
support  to  the  American  National  Standards  Institute’s  Nanotechnology  Stand-
ards  Panel  (ANSI–NSP)  and  the  ANSI-accredited  TAG  that  represents  the 
United  States  on  ISO  TC  229.  The  ANSI–NSP  leads  the  ISO  TC  229  working 
group on EHS aspects of nanotechnology. 
• Workshops  facilitating  technology  transfer  of  NNI  research  results.  Two  work-
shops have been held to bring together representatives from state and regional 
nanotechnology  commercialization  initiatives  to  learn  best  practices  and  ex-
change information. Other workshops have been convened to discuss opportuni-
ties  and  priorities  for  nanotechnology  research  in  specific  sub-fields,  where  in-
dustry  participants  are  invited  to  provide  input,  but  also  where  they  can  learn 
about  NNI-funded  research  that  may  be  of  interest  to  their  companies.  In  par-
ticular,  the  NNI  agencies  are  now  organizing  a  series  of  workshops  to  address 
research priorities in specific areas of nanotechnology-related EHS. 
• Research  on  manufacturing  at  the  nanoscale,  or  ‘‘nanomanufacturing.’’  Nano-
manufacturing will be key to the large-scale application of nanotechnology inno-

vations  for  commercial  and  public  benefit.  The  NNI  places  a  special  emphasis 
on  nanomanufacturing  research,  as  one  of  its  eight  program  component  areas 
(or PCAs). For example, NSF has established a new program dedicated to nano-
manufacturing  supporting  individual  projects  and  the  National  Nanomanufac-
turing Network. Several workshops have been conducted to help guide the NNI 
nanomanufacturing  research  agenda  and  coordinate  it  with  industry;  several 
more are planned for the near future. 

• Industry participation in NNI research. Another way in which technology trans-
fer  takes  place  is  within  the  interdisciplinary  research  centers  and  user  facili-
ties  around  the  country.  In  these  collaborative  environments,  researchers  from 
academia  and  industry  can  interact,  allowing  for  rapid  diffusion  of  knowledge 
and increasing the likelihood of innovation. 

Goal  3:  Develop  and  sustain  educational  resources,  a  skilled  work  force,  and  the 

supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology. 

One  of  the  chief  overarching  achievements  of  the  NNI  is  the  successful  develop-
ment and deployment of a unique infrastructure of nanotechnology research centers 
and user facilities, one that is second to none in the world. Part of the original NNI 
plan,  this  extensive  network  of  over  60  research  centers,  user  facilities  and  other 
infrastructure for nanotechnology research (more than 80 if you count other related 
centers  and  affiliated  institutions),  is  now  largely  established.  This  mature  infra-
structure  serves  to  accelerate  nanotechnology  research  and  development  and  en-
ables researchers from across various sectors to broadly leverage their interdiscipli-
nary intellectual and technological capital. 

With  respect  to  education  and  workforce  development,  education  is  among  the 
chief  objectives  of  NNI-funded  university  research.  In  addition,  there  are  specific 
programs  targeted  at  K–12  education,  educating  the  public  about  nanotechnology, 
and  improving  nanotechnology  curricula  in  our  schools  and  universities.  For  exam-
ple: 

• Educational  impact  is  among  the  key  review  criteria  for  NSF  proposals.  As  a 
result  of  the  NNI,  thousands  of  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  have  re-
ceived  training  in  nanoscale  science  and  technology,  providing  the  pipeline  for 
nanotechnology  workers  and  researchers  that  industry  needs  to  commercialize 
the results of basic research in nanoscale science and technology. NSF annually 
supports education for about 10,000 students and teachers in the field of nano-
technology. 

• The  NNI  has  created  strong  incentive  for  interdisciplinary  research  at  our 
major  research  institutions,  and  a  new  cadre  of  multi-disciplinary  researchers, 
trained  in  multiple  fields  previously  considered  ‘‘diverse’’  and  highly  distinct, 
such  as  biology  and  solid  state  physics.  While  we  retain  a  strong  appreciation 
for  the  importance  of  building  a  solid  foundation  for  our  researchers  of  the  fu-
ture in the traditional disciplines of science and engineering, it is this ‘‘silo bust-
ing’’ new culture of interdisciplinary research, and the new generation of multi-
disciplinary researchers emerging from the NNI-funded centers, that I consider 
to  be  one  of  the  greatest  achievements  of  the  NNI.  It  is  at  the  intersection  of 
the traditional disciplines where we are seeing some of the most interesting and 
potentially beneficial applications of nanotechnology emerge. 

• In addition to the general educational impact of the NNI discussed above, NNI 
agencies, particularly NSF, have also engaged in a number of initiatives to im-
prove  nanotechnology  education,  curricula,  and  workforce  development  specifi-
cally.  These  include  the  Nanotechnology  Center  for  Learning  and  Teaching 
(NCLT) and the Nanoscale Informal Science Education (NISE) Network. Details 
are available in the NNI Supplement to the President’s Budget for FY 2008. 

• The  NNI  has  recently  engaged  the  Departments  of  Education  and  Labor,  and 
the research agencies are now working with staff from those departments to de-
velop additional initiatives aimed at education and workforce development. 

Goal 4: Support responsible development of nanotechnology. 
The  activities  and  issues  associated  with  this  goal  have  received  a  great  deal  of 
attention by the NNI. The original NNI implementation plan of July 2000 included 
a  substantial  section  on  ‘‘Societal  Implications  of  Nanotechnology,’’  and  requested 
significant  resources  for  this  activity.  As  potential  EHS  concerns  about  nanomate-
rials began to emerge in the early years of the initiative, the NNI also led the way, 
holding in August 2003 the first interagency meeting on this subject, which eventu-
ally  led  to  the  establishment  of  the  formal  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and 
Health Implications (NEHI) interagency working group.

9 

In  December  2004,  the  NNI  released  a  strategic  plan  calling  out  EHS  research 
for  special  attention,  as  part  of  a  Program  Component  Area  (PCA)  on  Societal  Di-
mensions  of  Nanotechnology.  In  early  2005,  the  NEHI  Working  Group  began  work 
on  a  cross-agency  EHS  research  needs  document,  building  on  an  earlier  effort  in 
2004  to  inventory  existing  EHS  research  funded  under  the  NNI.  In  March  of  2005, 
the NNI released its Supplement to the President’s FY 2006 Budget,3 which for the 
first  time  reported  EHS  research  investments  separately.  In  the  fall  of  2005,  NNI 
began preparation of a research needs document. The resulting document, Environ-
mental, Health, and Safety Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials,4 re-
leased  in  September  2006,  identified  75  research  needs  within  five  general  cat-
egories  of  EHS  research.  It  also  set  out  a  plan  for  ‘‘next  steps’’  for  the  NNI  to  ad-
dress  this  issue,  including  further  prioritization  of  the  research  needs  identified  in 
the  report,  evaluation  of  the  existing  NNI  EHS  research  portfolio,  a  gap  analysis 
based  on  a  comparison  of  the  prioritized  research  needs  and  the  existing  research 
portfolio,  coordination  of  the  NNI  agencies’  research  programs  to  address  the  prior-
ities,  and  development  of  a  process  for  periodic  review  and  updating  of  research 
needs and priorities. 

The NEHI Working Group then proceeded to follow that ‘‘next steps’’ agenda. The 
research needs document was posted for public comment in the fall of 2006, followed 
by  a  public  meeting  to  gather  input  on  the  document  in  January  2007.  Based  on 
this input, the NEHI Working Group in August 2007 released an interim document 
for public comment entitled Prioritization of Environmental, Health, and Safety Re-
search Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials.5 That document narrowed the list 
of EHS research needs down to five in each of the categories, for a total of 25 high- 
priority research needs. Based on input on that interim document and extensive fur-
ther  analysis  by  the  EOP  and  the  agencies  involved,  in  February  2008  the  NEHI 
Working Group released its first comprehensive Strategy for Nanotechnology-Related 
Environmental, Health, and Safety Research.6 

This  strategy  for  the  NNI’s  EHS  research  presents  a  path  for  coordinated  inter-
agency implementation of research to address the needs identified in earlier reports. 
It  is  based  in  part  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  Federal  Government’s  FY  2006 
nanotechnology-related  EHS  research  portfolio,  a  $68  million  investment  in  246 
projects.  Experts  from  the  NEHI  Working  Group  analyzed  how  these  activities  ad-
dressed the priority research needs and then proposed emphasis and sequencing for 
future  research  efforts.  Agency-specific  research  and  regulatory  needs,  public  com-

ments  on  the  prior  documents,  and  considerations  of  the  state  of  EHS  research  in 
the national and international nanotechnology communities all played an important 
role in shaping the strategy. It reflects a strong commitment among the NNI mem-
ber agencies to the roles they will assume, consistent with their respective missions 
and  responsibilities,  to  move  the  Federal  efforts  in  nanotechnology-related  EHS  re-
search  forward.  The  comprehensive  detail  in  the  document  demonstrates  that  the 
NNI  is  working  hard  to  understand—and  to  think  strategically  about—nano  EHS 
issues in a systematic, coordinated fashion. As indicated in both the initial EHS re-
search needs document and in this new strategy document, the strategy will be up-
dated periodically. Furthermore, as indicated in the timeline above, the National Re-
search  Council  (NRC)  is  now  under  contract  from  the  NNCO  to  assess  the  EHS 
strategy.  Once  the  NRC  assessment  is  complete,  their  recommendations  will  be  in-
corporated, as appropriate, into an updated strategy. 

I think the NNI has made tremendous progress toward the goal of supporting re-
sponsible  development  of  nanotechnology.  Funding  for  EHS  research  in  particular 
has  more  than  doubled  since  FY  2005,  from  $35  million  to  $76  million  in  the  FY 
2009  request.  This  is  only  counting  the  narrowly  defined  ‘‘primary  purpose’’  EHS 
R&D.  Beyond  just  increasing  the  funding,  the  NNI  agencies  have  come  up  with  an 
excellent  strategy  that  all  the  relevant  agencies  support,  to  carry  forward  these  in-
vestments  in  the  most  effective  way  possible.  The  increasing  emphasis  on  EHS  is 
notable and important. 

I believe the Federal Government needs to ensure that nano-EHS research needs 
are adequately addressed. To this end, the NNI has systematically: (1) identified re-
search needs, (2) prioritized those needs, (3) developed an associated inventory from 
which a gap analysis can be performed, and (4) developed a strategy for addressing 
the prioritized needs that are not currently being addressed. The Administration be-
lieves this systematic approach is the right way to address EHS research needs. The 
Administration  therefore  does  not  support  establishing  an  arbitrary  EHS  set-aside. 
IV. Summary and Conclusions 

The  NNI  has  been  and  remains  a  highly  successful  enterprise,  due  in  large  part 
to  the  unparalleled  interagency  coordination  and  cooperation,  which  in  turn  has 
been  effective  because  of  the  voluntary,  ‘‘bottom  up’’  nature  of  that  cooperation,  in 
which all the agencies benefit. As demonstrated above and validated by external re-
views,  the  NNI  is  effectively  pursuing  its  goals  of  advancing  world-class  nanotech-
nology  R&D;  fostering  technology  transfer;  developing  and  sustaining  educational 
resources, work force, and supporting infrastructure; and supporting responsible de-
velopment  of  nanotechnology.  The  findings  of  the  external  reviews  clearly  indicate 
that  the  existing  structure  is  working  well,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the 
Committee as it considers the future of this successful program. 

APPENDIX I 

National Nanotechnology Initiative FY 2009 Budget and Highlights 

The  2009  Budget  provides  $1.5  billion  for  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative 
(NNI), reflecting steady growth in the NNI investment. This sustained major invest-
ment  in  nanotechnology  research  and  development  (R&D)  across  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment  over  the  past  nine  Fiscal  Years  of  the  NNI  reflects  the  broad  support  of 
the Administration and of Congress for this program, based on its potential to vastly 
improve  our  fundamental  understanding  and  control  of  matter,  ultimately  leading 
to  a  revolution  in  technology  and  industry  for  the  benefit  of  society.  The  NNI  re-
mains focused on fulfilling the Federal role of supporting basic research, infrastruc-
ture development, and technology transfer, in the expectation that the resulting ad-
vances  and  capabilities  will  make  important  contributions  to  national  priorities, 
with applications across a wide range of industries including healthcare, electronics, 
aeronautics,  and  energy.  Increasing  investments  by  mission  agencies  in  nanotech-
nology-related  research  since  2001  reflect  a  recognition  of  the  potential  for  this  re-
search to support agency missions and responsibilities. 

Table  1  provides  NNI  investments  in  2007–2009  for  Federal  agencies  with  budg-
ets/investments for nanotechnology R&D. Tables 2–4 list the investments by agency 
and  by  program  component  area  (PCA).  Note  that  the  program  component  areas 
shown  in  these  tables  are  those  outlined  in  the  new  NNI  Strategic  Plan  released 
in  December  2007,7 with  nanotechnology-related  environmental,  health,  and  safety 
(EHS)  research  now  reported  for  the  first  time  in  a  separate  PCA  from  education 
and other societal dimensions investments.

11 

The  2009  NNI  budget  supports  nanoscale  science  and  engineering  R&D  at  13 
agencies.  Agencies  with  the  greatest  investments  are  the  Department  of  Defense 
(DOD—investments  addressing  the  defense  mission);  the  National  Science  Founda-
tion  (NSF—fundamental  research  across  all  disciplines  of  science  and  engineering); 
the Department of Energy (DOE—research providing a basis for new and improved 
energy technologies); the National Institutes of Health (NIH, within the Department 
of  Health  and  Human  Services,  DHHS—nanotechnology-based  biomedical  research 
at  the  intersection  of  biology  and  the  physical  sciences);  and  the  National  Institute 
of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST—fundamental  research  and  development  of 
tools,  analytical  methodologies,  and  metrology  for  nanotechnology).  Other  agencies 
that  are  investing  in  mission-related  research  are  the  National  Aeronautics  and 
Space  Administration  (NASA),  the  National  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety  and 
Health  (NIOSH/DHHS),  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  and  the  De-
partments  of  Agriculture  (USDA—Cooperative  State  Research,  Education,  and  Ex-
tension  Service,  CSREES;  and  Forest  Service,  FS),  Homeland  Security  (DHS),  Jus-
tice (DOJ), and Transportation (DOT—Federal Highway Administration, FHWA). 
Key Points about the 2009 NNI Investments 

• The  2009  NNI  budget  provides  increased  support  for  research  on  fundamental 
nanoscale phenomena and processes, from $481 million in 2007 to $551 million 
in 2009. 
• Increases in nanotechnology R&D funding for DOE, NIST, and NSF reflect the 
President’s continuing commitment to significantly increase funding for physical 
sciences and engineering research as part of the American Competitiveness Ini-
tiative. 
• The proposed budget also reflects substantial ongoing growth in funding for in-
strumentation  research,  metrology,  and  standards  (from  $53  million  in  2007  to 
$82  million  in  2009)  and  in  nanomanufacturing  research  (from  $48  million  in 
2007  to  $62  million  in  2009).  NNI  agencies  are  gathering  input  and  feedback 
from  industry  and  the  research  community  on  these  growing  investments 
through a series of workshops. 
• EHS R&D funding in 2009 ($76 million) is over double the level of actual fund-
ing  in  2005  ($35  million)—the  first  year  this  data  was  collected.  The  steady 
growth in EHS R&D spending follows the NNI strategy of expanding the capac-
ity  to  do  high-quality  research  in  this  field.  For  tables  in  this  document,  EHS 
R&D  is  defined  as  research  whose  primary  purpose  is  to  understand  and  ad-
dress potential risks to health and to the environment posed by nanotechnology. 
Therefore  the  proposed  $76  million  for  2009  does  not  include  substantial  re-
search  reported  under  other  PCAs,  e.g.,  on  instrumentation  and  metrology  and 
on fundamental interactions between biosystems and engineered nanoscale ma-
terials,  both  of  which  are  important  in  the  performance  and  interpretation  of 
toxicological  research.  An  indication  of  the  level  of  funding  for  these  broader 
categories of nanotechnology-related EHS research may be deduced from the de-
tailed  2006  data  collected  and  analyzed  specifically  for  this  purpose.  This  data 
showed that the total funding for nanotechnology-related EHS research in 2006 
was  about  $68  million,  80  percent  higher  than  that  reported  for  ‘‘primary  pur-
pose research.’’ 
• A  more  detailed  Budget  Supplement  will  be  released  when  data  become  avail-
able  on  funding  for  nanotechnology  under  the  Small  Business  Innovation  Re-

Highlights of Ongoing and Planned Activities 

• The  extensive  network  of  research  centers,  user  facilities  and  other  infrastruc-
ture  for  nanotechnology  research,  originally  envisioned  as  a  key  element  of  the 
NNI strategy, is now largely complete. This mature infrastructure serves to ac-
celerate  nanotechnology  research  and  development  and  enables  researchers 
from  across  various  sectors  to  broadly  leverage  their  interdisciplinary  intellec-
tual  and  technological  capital.  NNI  agencies  are  encouraging  industrial  inter-
action with NNI-funded research centers, and are promoting broad access to the 
NNI  user  facilities  by  all  sectors,  including  small  businesses.  While  emphasis 
in  the  near  future  will  be  on  maximizing  the  utility  and  utilization  of  the  sub-
stantial  infrastructure  already  in  place,  the  agencies  will  also  consider  possible 
new needs for the longer term. 
• Industry  liaison  and  technology  transfer  activities  are  given  a  high  priority  in 
the new NNI Strategic Plan released in December 2007. NNI agencies are work-
ing  with  industry  representatives  to  gather  input  on  their  nanotechnology-re-
lated  activities  and  are  funding  increasing  numbers  of  nanotechnology-related 
SBIR and STTR awards to promote technology transfer to industry. Industry li-
aison groups with the electronics, forest products, and chemical industries, and 
with the industrial research management community, are continuing, while for-
mation of comparable groups with other sectors (e.g., the construction industry) 
is  under  consideration.  One  successful  example  is  the  collaboration  between 
NSF, NIST, and the industry-led Nanoelectronics Research Initiative, where in-
dustry  and  government  representatives  collaborate  in  reviewing  proposals  and 
in supporting pre-competitive research. In another example, NIH is formulating 
a  ‘‘NanoHealth  Enterprise,’’  which  is  envisioned  as  a  partnership  with  other 
Federal  agencies,  private  industry,  and  international  partners  to  address  re-
search needs for safe development of nanoscale materials and devices. 
• EHS research planning is a major activity for the NNI. In August 2007, the Na-
tional  Science  and  Technology  Council’s  Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering,  and 
Technology  (NSET)  Subcommittee  published  a  draft  report  for  public  comment 
prepared by its Nanotechnology Environmental and Health Implications (NEHI) 
Working Group entitled Prioritization of Environmental, Health, and Safety Re-
search  Needs  for  Engineered  Nanoscale  Materials,  and,  in  February  2008,  com-
pleted  a  comprehensive  Strategy  for  Nanotechnology-Related  Environmental, 
Health,  and  Safety  Research.  This  is  the  culmination  of  2  years  of  intensive 
work, including a detailed review of individual EHS research projects funded by 
the  NNI  agencies  in  2006,  as  a  guide  to  identification  of  gaps  in  the  research 
portfolio compared to the designated priority research areas. 
• As  the  NNI  EHS  research  strategy  evolves,  ongoing  activities  to  address  the 
breadth  of  EHS  issues  proceed  at  an  accelerating  pace.  A  Food  and  Drug  Ad-
ministration  (FDA)  task  force  released  a  report  in  2007  addressing  scientific 
questions related to the application of its regulatory authorities to nanotechnol-
ogy-enabled products. EPA issued a white paper on nanotechnology in 2007, and 
has initiated a Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program under the Toxic Sub-
stances Control Act (TSCA) to gather and develop information from manufactur-
ers, importers, processors and users of engineered chemical nanoscale materials. 
NIOSH  continues  to  update  its  guidance  document  on  best  practices  for  safe 
handling  of  nanomaterials  in  the  workplace,  and  has  posted  a  draft  document 
providing interim guidance on medical screening of workers potentially exposed 
to  engineered  nanoparticles.  NNI  agencies  organized  a  workshop  hosted  by 
NIST  in  September  2007  entitled  ‘‘Standards  for  Environmental,  Health,  and 
Safety  for  Engineered  Nanoscale  Materials.’’  On  the  research  front,  two  joint 
interagency solicitations addressing potential environmental and health implica-
tions  of  nanotechnology  continue.  One  (led  by  EPA,  with  NSF)  addresses  envi-
ronmental  implications,  while  another  (led  by  NIH,  with  EPA  and  NIOSH)  fo-
cuses  on  human  health  implications.  NSF  and  EPA  will  fund  a  new  Center  for 
Environmental  Implications  of  Nanotechnology  (CEIN)  in  2008.  NSF  plans  to 
form a network around it in 2009 with collaboration from EPA and other agen-
cies. 
• International collaborations in nanotechnology are progressing, with strong NNI 
participation.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development 
(OECD) Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials, chaired by the United 
States, has begun its work addressing health and safety issues. A second OECD 
working party formed under the Committee for Scientific and Technological Pol-
icy  is  addressing  broader  issues  such  as  economic  impact,  education  and  train-
ing, and public communication. With respect to standards development, the Na-
tional  Nanotechnology  Coordination  Office  and  several  NSET  member  agencies

represent the United States on the International Organization for Standardiza-
tion  (ISO)  Technical  Committee  on  Nanotechnologies  (ISO  TC  229),  and  the 
United States leads the ISO TC 229 working group on EHS aspects of nanotech-
nology. 

APPENDIX II 

A FEW EXAMPLES OF NNI SUPPORTED TRANSFERS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 

Research Results from the Laboratory to Applications and 

Commercialization 

In  addition  to  the  examples  given  below,  the  2007  NNI  Strategic  Plan 8 includes 
several  examples  of  early  NNI  successes  in  technology  transfer  (pp.  14–15),  as  well 
as  a  number  of  high-impact  application  opportunities  that  are  now  emerging  from 
NNI-funded  laboratories  (pp.  25–34).  Further,  the  new  PCAST/NNAP  report  in-
cludes  more  examples  of  technologies  that  are  being  transitioned  from  NNI-funded 
research into commercial applications. 

• One  of  the  original  motivations  for  the  NNI  was  the  need  for  more  basic  re-
search  in  nanotechnology-enabled  electronics,  photonics,  and  magnetics  re-
search,  to  keep  the  semiconductor  industry  on  the  ‘‘Moore’s  Law’’  curve  of  con-
tinuous  improvement  in  cost/performance  of  semiconductor  devices  that  has 
been so important to our economic prosperity in the past 50 years. While semi-
conductor  device  design  rules  have  been  in  the  sub–100  nanometer  range  for 
several  years  now,  at  the  time  of  the  NNI’s  inception,  leaders  in  the  industry 
were predicting that future progress would soon be hitting a ‘‘brick wall’’ where 
continued  scaling  of  traditional  CMOS  devices  would  be  difficult  or  impossible 
due to current leakage, heat dissipation problems, and interference by quantum 
effects that begin to dominate device behavior in the nanoscale size range. They 
called  on  the  Government  to  conduct  an  intensified  basic  research  program 
under the auspices of the NNI to address these problems, including the specific 
goal of developing a completely new paradigm to replace the electronic ‘‘switch’’ 
that is at the heart of both logic and memory devices. The collaboration by NSF 
and  NIST  with  industry  in  the  Nanoelectronics  Research  Initiative  referred  to 
above  was  one  of  the  NNI  responses  to  this  problem.  As  a  result  of  this  and 
other NNI investments in nano-electronics, -magnetics, and -photonics research 
and  infrastructure,  progress  in  addressing  this  problem  has  been  faster  than 
had  been  expected  previously.  At  a  meeting  of  the  President’s  Council  of  Advi-
sors  on  Science  and  Technology  on  January  8,  2008,  George  Scalise,  President 
of  the  Semiconductor  Industry  Association,  stated  that,  for  the  roadmaps  the 
semiconductor  industry  has  laid  out,  their  consensus  is  that  they  are  2  years 
ahead of where they thought they would be just a few years ago, thanks in part 
to  the  NRI  and  the  NNI.  Dr.  Scalise  also  said  that  for  the  next  generation 
switch,  most  of  the  new  ideas  are  coming  from  the  United  States,  not  from 
abroad. 
• Another major thrust of the NNI that has emerged in recent years is the appli-
cations of nanotechnology related to human health—i.e., to diagnosis and treat-
ment  of  disease.  The  budget  for  nanotechnology  research  at  the  National  Insti-
tutes  of  Health  (NIH)  has  increased  dramatically,  from  $40  million  in  2001  to 
a  proposed  $226  million  in  2009.  With  this  NIH  has  established  21  new  re-
search  centers  focused  on  nanomedicine  and  cancer  nanotechnology  R&D.  The 
range  of  biomedical  applications  of  nanotechnology  under  investigation  is  ex-
tremely  broad,  spanning  almost  all  of  the  NIH  institutes.  Widespread  clinical 
application  of  the  results  of  this  research  is  likely  to  take  many  years,  given 
the careful review and approval processes needed for such applications. But we 
can cite a couple of interesting examples that are nearing fruition in the cancer 
and regenerative medicine arenas, as follows: 
» Researchers  at  Northwestern  University  have  developed  a  diagnostic  biobar-
code  assay  based  on  nanotechnology  that  is  able  to  detect  each  of  the  three 
markers simultaneously at concentrations multiple orders of magnitude below 
that  detectable  by  the  standard  immunoassay.  The  biobarcode  assay  can  si-
multaneously  detect  trace  levels  of  multiple  biomarkers  (including  DNA  and 
proteins) associated with human cancers using oligonucleotide- and antibody- 
coated  gold  nanoparticles.  Nanoparticle-tagged  oligonucleotide  biobarcodes 
have  been  developed  to  detect  three  cancer-related  protein  biomarkers:  pros-

tate  specific  antigen  (PSA);  human  chorionic  gonadotrophin  (HCG),  a  marker 
for testicular cancer; and α-fetoprotein (AFP), a liver cancer marker. The abil-
ity  to  detect  low-levels  of  protein  biomarkers  directly  in  serum  in  a  multi-
plexed manner will enable more powerful diagnostic methods to detect early- 
stage malignancy. The nanotechnology biobarcode assay is being commercially 
developed  now;  so  far  the  FDA  has  cleared  its  use  for  two  molecular  diag-
nostic tests associated with blood disorders. 

» Another  group  at  Northwestern  has  developed  an  engineered  nanomaterial 
that  can  be  injected  into  damaged  spinal  cords  and  could  help  prevent  scars 
and  encourage  damaged  nerve  fibers  to  grow.  The  liquid  material  contains 
molecules that self-assemble into nanofibers, which act as a scaffold on which 
nerve fibers grow. Researchers have reported that treatment with the material 
restores  function  to  the  hind  legs  of  paralyzed  mice.  A  spinoff  company  has 
now  been  founded,  with  the  objective  of  developing  this  therapy  for  humans. 
Initial in vitro tests have shown no apparent toxicity to human cells. The next 
step  will  be  to  make  a  material  that  meets  FDA  standards  for  clinical  trials. 
This  example  is  particularly  interesting  for  several  reasons:  (1)  it  represents 
a  collaboration  between  a  materials  scientist  much  of  whose  work  was  ini-
tially  funded  by  the  National  Science  Foundation  and  a  stem  cell  biologist, 
working in a field with a strong history of NIH funding. As such it is a ster-
ling example of both interdisciplinary collaboration and interagency collabora-
tion  that  has  become  a  hallmark  of  the  NNI.  (2)  We  have  been  hearing  ru-
mors  of  this  work  and  seeing  private  presentations  on  it  for  several  years 
now. Only in the past month were the results of this particular breakthrough 
published  in  the  open  literature.  As  such,  we  think  this  example  is  just  the 
beginning of a flood of new biomedical applications of nanotechnology that are 
likely  to  come  to  light  in  coming  years,  as  innovations  make  their  way 
through  the  long  pipeline  between  initial  conception,  early  exploratory  re-
search,  initial  application  experiments,  in  vitro  safety  testing,  in  vivo  animal 
model  safety  and  effectiveness  testing,  and  finally  to  human  clinical  trials. 
Given  this  long  timeline  and  the  large  potential  payoffs  of  this  type  of  re-
search,  it  is  understandable  that  researchers  are  careful  about  when  they 
publish results in open literature. 

• There are numerous examples of potential applications of nanotechnology in en-
ergy  production,  conversion,  storage,  transmission,  and  conservation.  Just  one 
of these examples addressed in the recently released PCAST report concerns the 
use of nanotechnology to enhance the efficiency and lower the cost of converting 
energy  in  sunlight  directly  into  electricity,  known  as  photovoltaics.  Thin-film 
photovoltaic  technology  has  improved  over  the  last  decade  to  a  point  where  it 
can  now  convert  sunlight  to  electricity  as  efficiently  as  all  but  the  most  expen-
sive silicon-based solar cells. New low-cost production methods could help make 
these thin-film cells an important contributor to the Nation’s energy needs. One 
company  that  has  received  substantial  funding  from  NNI  agencies,  Nanosolar, 
Inc.  is  using  printing  presses  instead  of  vacuum  deposition  equipment  to  make 
solar  panels  based  on  a  semiconducting  material  called  copper  indium  gallium 
diselenide  (CIGS).  The  presses  deposit  nanostructured  ink,  which  is  then  proc-
essed  to  create  the  light-absorbing  nanoarchitecture  at  the  heart  of  the  solar 
cell. Nanosolar has recently shipped its first utility-scale panels.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT A. ROBINSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, 

NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT, 
U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 

Mr. ROBINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to 
briefly  present  GAO’s  work  on  this  very  important  aspect  of  Fed-
eral nanotechnology research. 

I  would  like  to  note  for  the  record  that  today  I  am  sitting  in  for 
Anu  Mittal,  who  directed  the  work  on  this  project  but  is  unable  to 
be here today because she is undergoing treatment for a very seri-
ous illness.

At the request of the full Committee and several other Members 
of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, we examined how the 
NNI  is  addressing  the  potential  environmental,  health,  and  safety 
risks, so-called EHS risks, that may be associated with exposure to 
nanoscale materials. 

Nanotechnology  has  vast  potential  for  truly  transformational  in-
novation in virtually every industry and hundreds of products com-
mon  to  consumers  today  and  others  that  perhaps  we  can  only 
dream of. Some of what seems to be possible can only be described 
by someone of my age as jaw-dropping. 

At  the  same  time,  the  unique  properties  and  microscale  size  of 
these materials raise questions about their risk to the human body 
and  the  environment  whose  answers  are  not  fully  known  and 
where  research  is  needed  to  fill  the  information  gaps.  In  this  con-
text, the Committee asked us to examine: (a) the extent of Federal 
research  on  these  risks  in  2006  which  was  the  latest  year  where 
data was available at the time of our review, (b) the reasonableness 
of  Federal  efforts  to  identify  and  prioritize  research  needs  in  this 
area,  and  (c)  the  effectiveness  of  Federal  efforts  to  coordinate  and 
collaborate on this research. 

As  presented  in  the  report  that  you  have  released  today,  here’s 

what we found. 

First,  in  2006,  Federal  agencies  reported  devoting  about  3  per-
cent  or  about  $38  million  of  the  $1.3  billion  in  total  Federal  nano-
technology research funding to EHS risks. 

Our  analysis,  however,  shows  that  this  figure  somewhat  over-
states  the  actual  extent  of  EHS  research.  About  20  percent  of  the 
research  that  the  agencies  classified  to  us  as  being  primarily  fo-
cused on EHS actually dealt with using nanotechnology to address 
other kinds of environmental issues rather than on the risks associ-
ated with nanotechnology itself. 

This misclassification resulted mostly from agency confusion over 
how  to  characterize  this  kind  of  research  in  the  existing  reporting 
structure  and  how  to  apportion  research  funding  that  addressed 
multiple objectives at the same time. 

Given  the  relatively  small  size  of  research  funding  devoted  to 
EHS  issues  and  the  differences  of  opinion  about  the  appropriate 
percentage  of  nanotechnology  funding  that  should  be  devoted  to 
EHS risks, errors of this size are not inconsequential. 

Second,  the  process  used  by  NNI  and  the  Federal  agencies  to 
identify and prioritize EHS risks and the associated research needs 
appeared reasonable overall. The priorities were arrived at in a col-
laborative, iterative, and professional fashion, and the research ac-
tually  conducted  was  generally  consistent  with  agreed  upon  prior-
ities. 

However,  at  the  time  of  our  review,  the  NNI  had  not  yet  com-
pleted  its  strategic  EHS  research  plan.  This  plan,  which  has  been 
released  just  a  month  or  so  ago,  falls  short  of  expectations  on  sev-
eral levels. 

Third, coordination of EHS research, among the 25 agencies par-
ticipating  in  NNI,  has  been  generally  effective.  The  agencies  meet 
frequently  to  identify  opportunities  for  collaboration,  jointly  spon-
sor  research  workshops,  have  detailed  staff  to  each  other,  and 
share  the  sense  that  a  common  purpose,  a  stable  group  member-

20 

ship  and  mutual  respect  for  each  other’s  roles  in  an  exciting  mis-
sion has led to a satisfying and effective working relationship. rela-
tionship. 

While  presenting  a  generally  favorable  picture  of  Federal  nano-
technology research activities, we did make one recommendation to 
improve  them.  Specifically,  we  believe  that  to  clearly  understand 
the potential EHS risks and the gaps in ongoing research, it is es-
sential  to  have  consistent,  accurate  and  complete  information  on 
the  extent  to  which  agency  research  is  designed  to  address  those 
risks. 

Transparency  and  credibility  of  the  information  presented  is  vi-
tally important to ensure public confidence in the Government’s ef-
forts on this very important front. 

Right  now,  however,  the  inventory  of  projects  identified  as  ad-
dressing  these  risks  is  not  entirely  accurate.  To  improve  the  accu-
racy  of  this  inventory,  we  recommend  that  the  guidance  provided 
to  agencies  on  how  to  report  the  focus  of  their  research  activities 
be improved. 

Mr.  Chairman,  let  me  close  my  prepared  remarks  here  and  we’d 

love to get into conversation.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT A. ROBINSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NATURAL 

RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: 
I  am  pleased  to  be  here  today  to  participate  in  your  hearing  on  the  future  direc-
tion  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI).  As  you  know,  the  NNI  was 
established  in  2001  as  a  Federal,  multiagency  effort  intended  to  accelerate  the  dis-
covery,  development,  and  deployment  of  nanoscale  science,  engineering,  and  tech-
nology  to  achieve  economic  benefits,  enhance  the  quality  of  life,  and  promote  na-
tional security. One of the key roles of the NNI is to coordinate the nanotechnology- 
related  activities  of  25  Federal  agencies.  These  agencies  include  both  those  that 
fund  nanoscale  research  as  well  as  those  that  have  a  stake  in  the  outcome  of  this 
research,  such  as  agencies  that  regulate  products  containing  nanomaterials.  While 
the  NNI  is  designed  to  facilitate  intergovernmental  cooperation  and  identify  goals 
and  priorities  for  nanotechnology  research,  it  is  not  a  research  program.  It  has  no 
funding or authority to dictate the nanotechnology research agenda for participating 
agencies or to ensure that adequate resources are available to achieve specific goals. 
Instead, participating agencies develop and fund their own nanotechnology research 
agendas,  and  in  Fiscal  Year  2006,  13  of  the  25  agencies  participating  in  the  NNI 
allocated  a  total  of  about  $1.3  billion  from  their  appropriated  budgets  to  nanotech-
nology  research  and  development  activities.  Of  this  total  in  Fiscal  Year  2006,  the 
NNI  reported  that  $37.7  million  (or  about  3  percent  of  the  total)  was  used  to  fund 
research  to  study  the  potential  environmental,  health,  and  safety  (EHS)  risks  that 
might  result  from  exposure  during  the  manufacture,  use,  and  disposal  or  recycle  of 
nanoscale materials. As you know, while the use of nanoscale materials holds much 
promise,  the  small  size  and  unique  properties  of  these  materials  raise  questions 
about  their  potential  EHS  risks,  and  research  is  needed  to  fill  current  gaps  in  sci-
entific information about their risks. 

At the request of the full committee and Members of the Congressional Nanotech-
nology Caucus, we just completed a report that is being released today on the NNI’s 
and Federal agencies’ efforts to study the potential environmental, health, and safe-
ty  risks  of  nanotechnology.1 My  testimony  is  based  on  the  findings  of  this  review 
and  will  cover  the  following  three  areas:  (1)  the  extent  to  which  selected  research 
and  regulatory  agencies  conducted  research  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  that  primarily  was 
focused on the potential EHS risks of nanotechnology; (2) the reasonableness of the 
processes that agencies and the NNI use to identify and prioritize Federal research

on  the  potential  EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology;  and  (3)  the  effectiveness  of  the  proc-
esses  that  agencies  and  the  NNI  use  to  coordinate  their  research.  For  our  review, 
we collected data from five Federal agencies that provided 96 percent of Fiscal Year 
2006  funding  for  EHS  research—the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA),  the 
National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  the  National  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety 
and  Health  (NIOSH),  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST), 
and  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF).  We  also  contacted  three  regulatory 
agencies—the  U.S.  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission  (CPSC),  the  Food  and 
Drug  Administration  (FDA),  and  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administra-
tion (OSHA)—that do not have specific research budgets to determine whether they 
conducted any research on their own relative to potential EHS risks. We conducted 
this  performance  audit  from  June  2007  to  February  2008  in  accordance  with  gen-
erally  accepted  government  auditing  standards.  Those  standards  require  that  we 
plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  sufficient,  appropriate  evidence  to  provide  a 
reasonable  basis  for  our  finding  and  conclusions  based  on  our  audit  objectives.  We 
believe  that  the  evidence  obtained  provides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  findings  and 
conclusions based on our audit objectives. 

In summary we found the following: 
• About 20 percent of the over $37 million in Fiscal Year 2006 research expendi-
tures  that  the  NNI  reported  as  being  primarily  focused  on  the  EHS  risks  of 
nanotechnology cannot actually be attributed to this purpose. We found that 22 
of  the  119  projects  identified  as  EHS-related  by  EPA,  NIH,  NIOSH,  NIST,  and 
NSF in Fiscal Year 2006 were not primarily related to understanding the extent 
to  which  nanotechnology  poses  an  EHS  risk.  These  22  projects,  funded  by  NSF 
and NIOSH, accounted for about $7 million of the $37 million that the NNI re-
ported  as  being  primarily  focused  on  EHS  risks.  The  focus  of  many  of  these 
projects was to explore how nanotechnology could be used to remediate environ-
mental  damage  or  to  detect  a  variety  of  hazards  unrelated  to  nanotechnology. 
We  determined  that  this  mischaracterization  was  the  result  of  the  current  re-
porting  structure  that  does  not  allow  these  types  of  projects  to  be  easily  cat-
egorized in another more appropriate category, and also the lack of guidance for 
agencies on how to apportion research funding across multiple topics, when ap-
propriate. To address this issue, we recommended that the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy (OSTP), in consultation with the NNI and the Office of Man-
agement and Budget (OMB), provide better guidance to agencies regarding how 
to report research that is primarily focused on understanding or addressing the 
EHS risks of nanotechnology. In commenting on this report, OSTP asserted that 
it  already  provides  extensive  guidance,  but  it  agreed  to  review  the  manner  in 
which agencies respond to the current guidance. 
• In addition to the EHS funding totals reported by the NNI, we found that Fed-
eral  agencies  conduct  other  EHS  research  that  is  not  captured  in  the  NNI  to-
tals.  This  research  was  not  captured  by  the  NNI  because  either  the  research 
was  funded  by  an  agency  not  generally  considered  to  be  a  research  agency  or 
because  the  primary  purpose  of  the  research  was  not  to  study  EHS  risks.  Be-
cause  the  agencies  that  conduct  this  research  do  not  systematically  track  it  as 
EHS-related research, we could not establish the exact amount of Federal fund-
ing that is being devoted to this additional EHS research. 
• Federal  agencies  and  the  NNI  were,  at  the  time  of  our  review,  in  the  process 
of identifying and prioritizing EHS risk research needs; overall, we believe that 
the  process  they  were  using  was  reasonable.  For  example,  identification  and 
prioritization  of  EHS  research  needs  was  being  done  by  the  agencies  and  the 
NNI collaboratively. The NNI was also engaged in an iterative prioritization ef-
fort  through  its  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implications 
(NEHI) working group. As a result of this effort, NEHI had identified five gen-
eral research categories that should be the focus of Federal research efforts and 
five specific research priorities under each general category. Our analysis of the 
97  research  projects  that  were  underway  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  that  were  pri-
marily related to studying EHS risks found that the focus of these projects was 
generally  consistent  with  agency  priorities  as  well  as  NEHI’s  five  general  re-
search categories. However, we did find that, while agency funded research ad-
dressed  each  of  the  five  general  research  categories,  it  focused  on  the  priority 
needs within each category to varying degrees. As our report was in production, 
NEHI  released  a  new  EHS  research  strategy  on  February  13,  2008,  which  is 
intended  to  provide  a  framework  to  help  ensure  that  the  highest  priority  EHS 
research needs are met. 
• Agency  and  NNI  processes  to  coordinate  activities  related  to  potential  EHS 
risks of nanotechnology have been generally effective. The NEHI working group

has  convened  frequent  meetings  that  have  helped  agencies  identify  opportuni-
ties to collaborate on EHS risk issues, such as joint sponsorship of research and 
workshops  to  advance  knowledge  and  facilitate  information-sharing  among  the 
agencies. These types of exchanges, according to most agency officials we spoke 
with,  have  helped  advance  knowledge  and  facilitated  information-sharing 
among  the  agencies.  In  addition,  NEHI  has  incorporated  several  practices  that 
we  have  previously  identified  as  key  to  enhancing  and  sustaining  interagency 
collaborative  efforts,  such  as  defining  a  common  outcome  and  leveraging  re-
sources,  but  it  had  not,  at  the  time  of  our  review,  completed  its  overarching 
strategy  to  help  better  align  agencies’  EHS  research  efforts.  Finally,  all  agency 
officials we spoke with expressed satisfaction with the coordination and collabo-
ration  on  EHS  risk  research  that  has  occurred  through  NEHI.  They  cited  sev-
eral  factors  they  believe  contribute  to  the  group’s  effectiveness,  including  the 
stability  of  the  working  group  membership  and  the  expertise  and  dedication  of 
its  members.  Furthermore,  according  to  these  officials,  this  stability,  combined 
with common research needs and general excitement about the new science, has 
resulted in a collegial, productive working environment. 

Background 

Nanotechnology  encompasses  a  wide  range  of  innovations  based  on  the  under-
standing  and  control  of  matter  at  the  scale  of  nanometers—the  equivalent  of  one- 
billionth  of  a  meter.  To  illustrate,  a  sheet  of  paper  is  about  100,000  nanometers 
thick  and  a  human  hair  is  about  80,000  nanometers  wide.  At  the  nanoscale  level, 
materials  may  exhibit  electrical,  biological,  and  other  properties  that  differ  signifi-
cantly  from  the  properties  the  same  materials  exhibit  at  a  larger  scale.  Exploiting 
these  differences  in  nanoscale  materials  has  led  to  a  range  of  commercial  uses  and 
holds the promise for innovations in virtually every industry from aerospace and en-
ergy  to  health  care  and  agriculture.  In  2006,  an  estimated  $50  billion  in  products 
worldwide  incorporated  nanotechnology  and  this  figure  has  been  projected  to  grow 
to  $2.6  trillion  by  2014.  One  research  institute  estimates  that  over  500  consumer 
products already available to consumers may contain nanoscale materials. 

The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)  was  established  in  2001  as  a  Fed-
eral,  multiagency  effort  intended  to  accelerate  the  discovery,  development,  and  de-
ployment of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology to achieve economic ben-
efits, enhance the quality of life, and promote national security. Management of the 
NNI  falls  under  the  purview  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council 
(NSTC)  that  coordinates  science  and  technology  policy  across  the  Federal  Govern-
ment. The NSTC is managed by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy (OSTP), who also serves as the Science Advisor to the President. The NSTC’s 
Committee  on  Technology  established  the  Nanoscale  Science,  Engineering,  and 
Technology (NSET) subcommittee to help coordinate, plan, and implement the NNI’s 
activities across participating agencies. In 2003, the NSET subcommittee further es-
tablished  a  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implications  (NEHI)  work-
ing  group.2 The  purpose  of  the  NEHI  working  group,  composed  of  representatives 
from  16  research  and  regulatory  agencies,  is  to,  among  other  things,  coordinate 
agency  efforts  related  to  EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology.  Similar  to  the  NNI,  the 
NEHI  working  group  has  no  authority  to  mandate  research  priorities  or  to  ensure 
that agencies adequately fund particular research. 

In December 2003, Congress enacted legislation to establish a National Nanotech-
nology  Program  to  coordinate  Federal  nanotechnology  research  and  development.3 
Among  other  things,  the  act  directs  the  NSTC  to  establish  goals  and  priorities  for 
the  program  and  to  set  up  program  component  areas  that  reflect  those  goals  and 
priorities. To implement these requirements, the NSTC has established a process to 
categorize  research  projects  and  activities  undertaken  by  the  various  Federal  agen-
cies into seven areas. Six of the seven focus on the discovery, development, and de-
ployment of nanotechnology, while the seventh relates to the societal dimensions of 
nanotechnology that include issues such as the EHS risks of nanotechnology. 

As  part  of  the  annual  Federal  budget  process,  agencies  also  report  their  research 
funding  for  each  area  to  OMB.  The  NNI’s  annual  Supplement  to  the  President’s 
Budget,  prepared  by  the  NSTC,  includes  EHS  research  figures  from  the  agencies 
and  a  general  description  of  the  research  conducted  by  the  agencies  in  each  of  the 
areas.  For  reporting  purposes,  the  NSET  subcommittee  has  defined  EHS  research 

2 As  of  December  2007,  a  total  of  four  working  groups  exist  within  the  NSET  subcommittee: 
(1)  Global  Issues  in  Nanotechnology;  (2)  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implica-
tions; (3) Nanomanufacturing, Industry Liaison, and Innovation; and (4) Nanotechnology Public 
Engagement and Communications.

as  efforts  whose  primary  purpose  is  to  understand  and  address  potential  risks  to 
health  and  to  the  environment  posed  by  nanotechnology.  Eight  of  the  13  agencies 
that  funded  nanotechnology  research  in  Fiscal  Year  2006  reported  having  devoted 
some  of  those  resources  to  research  that  had  a  primary  focus  on  potential  EHS 
risks. 

Under  the  NNI,  each  agency  funds  research  and  development  projects  that  sup-
port  its  own  mission  as  well  as  the  NNI’s  goals.  While  agencies  share  information 
on  their  nanotechnology-related  research  goals  with  the  NSET  subcommittee  and 
NEHI  working  group,  each  agency  retains  control  over  its  decisions  on  the  specific 
projects  to  fund.  While  the  NNI  was  designed  to  facilitate  intergovernmental  co-
operation  and  identify  goals  and  priorities  for  nanotechnology  research,  it  is  not  a 
research  program.  It  has  no  funding  or  authority  to  dictate  the  nanotechnology  re-
search agenda for participating agencies. 

The  NNI  used  its  Fiscal  Year  2000  strategic  plan  and  its  subsequent  updates  to 
delineate  a  strategy  to  support  long-term  nanoscale  research  and  development, 
among other things. A key component of the 2000 plan was the identification of nine 
specific  research  and  development  areas—known  as  ‘‘grand  challenges’’—that  high-
lighted Federal research on applications of nanotechnology with the potential to re-
alize significant economic, governmental, and societal benefits. 

In 2004, the NNI updated its strategic plan and described its goals as well as the 
investment  strategy  by  which  those  goals  were  to  be  achieved.  Consistent  with  the 
21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act,  the  NNI  reorganized 
its  major  subject  categories  of  research  and  development  investment  into  program 
component  areas  (PCA)  that  cut  across  the  interests  and  needs  of  the  participating 
agencies.  These  seven  areas  replaced  the  nine  grand  challenges  that  the  agencies 
had  used  to  categorize  their  nanotechnology  research.  Six  of  the  areas  focus  on  the 
discovery, development, and deployment of nanotechnology. The seventh, societal di-
mensions, consists of two topics—research on environmental, health, and safety; and 
education  and  research  on  ethical,  legal,  and  other  societal  aspects  of  nanotechnol-
ogy. 

PCAs are intended to provide a means by which the NSET subcommittee, OSTP, 
OMB,  Congress,  and  others  may  be  informed  of  the  relative  Federal  investment  in 
these key areas. PCAs also provide a structure by which the agencies that fund re-
search can better direct and coordinate their activities. In response to increased con-
cerns about the potential EHS risks of nanotechnology, the NSET subcommittee and 
the agencies agreed in Fiscal Year 2005 to separately report their research funding 
for each of the two components of the societal dimensions PCA. The December 2007 
update  of  the  NNI’s  strategic  plan  reaffirmed  the  program’s  goals,  identified  steps 
to  accomplish  those  goals,  and  formally  divided  the  societal  dimensions  PCA  into 
two  PCAs—’’environment,  health,  and  safety’’  and  ‘‘education  and  societal  dimen-
sions.’’ 

Beginning with the development of the Fiscal Year 2005 Federal budget, agencies 
have worked with OMB to identify funding for nanoscale research that would be re-
flected  in  the  NNI’s  annual  Supplement  to  the  President’s  Budget.  OMB  analysts 
reviewed  aggregated,  rather  than  project-level,  data  on  research  funding  for  each 
PCA to help ensure consistent reporting across the agencies. Agencies also relied on 
definitions  of  the  PCAs  developed  by  the  NSET  subcommittee  to  determine  the  ap-
propriate  area  in  which  to  report  research  funding.  Neither  NSET  nor  OMB  pro-
vided guidance on whether or how to apportion funding for a single research project 
to  more  than  one  PCA,  if  appropriate.  However,  representatives  from  both  NSET 
and  OMB  stressed  that  the  agencies  were  not  to  report  each  research  dollar  more 
than once. 
Almost  One-Fifth  of  Reported  EHS  Research  Projects  Were  Not  Primarily 

Focused on Studying the EHS Risks of Nanotechnology 

About  18  percent  of  the  total  research  dollars  reported  by  the  agencies  as  being 
primarily  focused  on  the  study  of  nanotechnology-related  EHS  risks  in  Fiscal  Year 
2006  cannot  actually  be  attributed  to  this  purpose.  Specifically,  we  found  that  22 
of  the  119  projects  funded  by  five  Federal  agencies  were  not  primarily  related  to 
studying  EHS  risks.  These  22  projects  accounted  for  about  $7  million  of  the  total 
that  the  NNI  reported  as  supporting  research  primarily  focused  on  EHS  risks.  Al-
most  all  of  these  projects—20  out  of  22—were  funded  by  NSF,  with  the  two  addi-
tional  projects  funded  by  NIOSH.  We  found  that  the  primary  purpose  of  many  of 
these  22  projects  was  to  explore  ways  to  use  nanotechnology  to  remediate  environ-
mental damage or to identify environmental, chemical, or biological hazards not re-
lated  to  nanotechnology.  For  example,  some  NSF-funded  research  explored  the  use 
of nanotechnology to improve water or gaseous filtration systems. Table 1 shows our

a Figures differ slightly from those reported by the NNI in the Supplement to the President’s FY2008 Budget 
due  to  rounding  error  or  modifications  made  to  the  project-level  data  after  they  were  reported  by  agencies  to 
the NNI. 

We  found  that  the  miscategorization  of  these  22  projects  resulted  largely  from  a 
reporting  structure  for  nanotechnology  research  that  does  not  easily  allow  agencies 
to  recognize  projects  that  use  nanotechnology  to  improve  the  environment  or  en-
hance  the  detection  of  environmental  contaminants,  and  from  the  limited  guidance 
available  to  the  agencies  on  how  to  consistently  report  EHS  research.  From  Fiscal 
Years  2001  to  2004,  the  NSET  subcommittee  categorized  Federal  research  and  de-
velopment  activities  into  nine  categories,  known  as  ‘‘grand  challenges,’’  that  in-
cluded  one  focused  on  ‘‘nanoscale  processes  for  environmental  improvement.’’  Agen-
cies  initiated  work  on  many  of  these  22  projects  under  the  grand  challenges  cat-
egorization  scheme.  Starting  in  Fiscal  Year  2005,  NSET  adopted  a  new  categoriza-
tion  scheme,  based  on  PCAs,  for  agencies  to  report  their  nanotechnology  research. 
The  new  scheme  eliminated  the  research  category  of  environmental  improvement 
applications  and  asked  agencies  to  report  research  designed  to  address  or  under-
stand  the  risks  associated  with  nanotechnology  as  part  of  the  societal  dimensions 
PCA. 

The new scheme shifted the focus from applications-oriented research to research 
focused  on  the  EHS  implications  of  nanotechnology.  However,  the  new  scheme  had 
no way for agencies to categorize environmentally focused research that was under-
way.  As  a  result,  NSF  and  NIOSH  characterized  these  projects  as  EHS  focused  for 
lack of a more closely related category to place them in, according to program man-
agers.  Furthermore,  neither  NSET  nor  OMB  provided  agencies  guidance  on  how  to 
apportion the dollars for a single project to more than one program component area, 
when  appropriate.  This  is  especially  significant  for  broad,  multiphase  research 
projects, such as NSF’s support to develop networks of research facilities. Of the five 
agencies we reviewed, only NSF apportioned funds for a single project to more than 
one PCA. 

In  addition  to  research  reported  to  the  NNI  as  being  primarily  focused  on  the 
EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology,  some  agencies  conduct  research  that  is  not  reflected 
in the EHS totals provided by the NNI either because they are not considered Fed-
eral  research  agencies  or  because  the  primary  purpose  of  the  research  was  not  to 
study EHS risks. For example, some agencies conduct research that results in infor-
mation  highly  relevant  to  EHS  risks  but  that  was  not  primarily  directed  at  under-
standing  or  addressing  those  risks  and  therefore  is  not  captured  in  the  EHS  total. 
This  type  of  research  provides  information  that  is  needed  to  understand  and  meas-
ure  nanomaterials  to  ensure  safe  handling  and  protection  against  potential  health 
or  environmental  hazards;  however,  such  research  is  captured  under  other  PCAs, 
such  as  instrumentation,  metrology,  and  standards.  Because  the  agencies  that  con-
duct this research do not systematically track it as EHS-related, we could not estab-

lish  the  exact  amount  of  Federal  funding  that  is  being  devoted  to  this  additional 
EHS research. 
Processes  to  Identify  and  Prioritize  Needed  EHS  Research  Appear 
Reasonable  and  Are  Ongoing  but  a  Comprehensive  Research  Strategy 
Has Not Yet Been Developed 

All  eight  agencies  in  our  review  have  processes  in  place  to  identify  and  prioritize 
the  research  they  need  related  to  the  potential  EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology.  Most 
agencies have developed task forces or designated individuals to specifically consider 
nanotechnology issues and identify priorities, although the scope and exact purpose 
of these activities differ by agency. Once identified, agencies communicate their EHS 
research priorities to the public and to the research community in a variety of ways, 
including  publication  in  agency  documents  that  specifically  address  nanotechnology 
issues,  agency  strategic  plans  or  budget  documents,  agency  websites,  and  presen-
tations at public conferences or workshops. We determined that each agency’s nano-
technology research priorities generally reflected its mission. For example, the prior-
ities  identified  by  FDA  and  CPSC  are  largely  focused  on  the  detection  and  safety 
of nanoparticles in the commercial products they regulate. On the other hand, EHS 
research  priorities  identified  by  NSF  reflect  its  broader  mission  to  advance  science 
in  general,  and  include  a  more  diverse  range  of  priorities,  such  as  the  safety  and 
transport  of  nanomaterials  in  the  environment,  and  the  safety  of  nanomaterials  in 
the workplace. 

In  addition  to  the  efforts  of  individual  agencies,  the  NSET  subcommittee  has  en-
gaged in an iterative prioritization process through its NEHI working group. Begin-
ning  in  2006,  NEHI  identified  but  did  not  prioritize  five  broad  research  categories 
and  75  more  specific  subcategories  of  needs  where  additional  information  was  con-
sidered  necessary  to  further  evaluate  the  potential  EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology. 
NEHI  obtained  public  input  on  its  2006  report  and  released  another  report  in  Au-
gust 2007, in which it distilled the previous list of 75 unprioritized specific research 
needs  into  a  set  of  five  prioritized  needs  for  each  of  the  five  general  research  cat-
egories.  The  NEHI  working  group  has  used  these  initial  steps  to  identify  the  gaps 
between  the  needs  and  priorities  it  has  identified  and  the  research  that  agencies 
have  underway.  NEHI  issued  a  report  summarizing  the  results  of  this  analysis  in 
February 2008. 

Although a comprehensive research strategy for EHS research had not been final-
ized at the time of our review, the prioritization processes taking place within indi-
vidual  agencies  and  the  NNI  appeared  to  be  reasonable.  Numerous  agency  officials 
said  their  agency’s  EHS  research  priorities  were  generally  reflected  both  in  the 
NEHI working group’s 2006 research needs and 2007 research prioritization reports. 
Our  comparison  of  agency  nanotechnology  priorities  to  the  NNI’s  priorities  corrobo-
rated these statements. Specifically, we found that all but one of the research prior-
ities identified by individual agencies could be linked to one or more of the five gen-
eral research categories. According to agency officials, the alignment of agency prior-
ities with the general research categories is particularly beneficial to the regulatory 
agencies,  such  as  CPSC  and  OSHA,  which  do  not  conduct  their  own  research,  but 
rely instead on research agencies for data to inform their regulatory decisions. 

In  addition,  we  found  that  the  primary  purposes  of  agency  projects  underway  in 
Fiscal  Year  2006  were  generally  consistent  with  both  agency  priorities  and  the 
NEHI working group’s research categories. Of these 97 projects, 43 were focused on 
Nanomaterials  and  Human  Health,  including  all  18  of  the  projects  funded  by  NIH. 
EPA and NSF funded all 25 projects related to Nanomaterials and the Environment. 
These  two  general  research  categories  accounted  for  70  percent  of  all  projects  fo-
cused on EHS risks. 

Furthermore,  we  determined  that,  while  agency-funded  research  addressed  each 
of  the  five  general  research  categories,  it  focused  on  the  priority  needs  within  each 
category  to  varying  degrees.  Specifically,  we  found  that  the  two  highest-priority 
needs  in  each  category  were  addressed  only  slightly  more  frequently  than  the  two 
lowest-priority needs. 

Moreover, although the NEHI working group considered the five specific research 
priorities  related  to  human  health  equally  important,  19  of  the  43  projects  focused 
on a single priority—’’research to determine the mechanisms of interaction between 
nanomaterials  and  the  body  at  the  molecular,  cellular,  and  tissular  levels.’’  Table 
2 shows a summary of projects by agency and specific NEHI research priority.

Coordination  Processes  Have  Fostered  Interagency  Collaboration  and 

Information-Sharing 

Agency  and  NNI  processes  to  coordinate  research  and  other  activities  related  to 
the  potential  EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology  have  been  generally  effective,  and  have 
resulted  in  numerous  interagency  collaborations.  All  eight  agencies  in  our  review 
have  collaborated  on  multiple  occasions  with  other  NEHI-member  agencies  on  ac-
tivities related to the EHS risks of nanotechnology. These EHS-related activities are 
consistent  with  the  expressed  goals  of  the  larger  NNI—to  promote  the  integration 
of  Federal  efforts  through  communication,  coordination,  and  collaboration.  The 
NEHI working group is at the center of this effort. 

We found that regular NEHI working group meetings, augmented by informal dis-
cussions,  have  provided  a  venue  for  agencies  to  exchange  information  on  a  variety 
of  topics  associated  with  EHS  risks,  including  their  respective  research  needs  and 
opportunities for collaborations. Interagency collaboration has taken many forms, in-
cluding  joint  sponsorship  of  EHS-related  research  and  workshops,  the  detailing  of 
staff  to  other  NEHI  working  group  agencies,  and  various  other  general  collabora-
tions or memoranda of understanding. 

Furthermore,  the  NEHI  working  group  has  adopted  a  number  of  practices  GAO 
has  previously  identified  as  essential  to  helping  enhance  and  sustain  collaboration 
among  Federal  agencies.4 For  example,  in  2005  NEHI  clearly  defined  its  purpose 
and objectives and delineated roles and responsibilities for group members. Further-
more,  collaboration  through  multiagency  grant  announcements  and  jointly  spon-
sored workshops has served as a mechanism to leverage limited resources to achieve 
increased knowledge about potential EHS risks. 

Finally,  all  agency  officials  we  spoke  with  expressed  satisfaction  with  their  agen-
cy’s participation in the NEHI working group, specifically, the coordination and col-

laboration on EHS risk research and other activities that have occurred as a result 
of  their  participation.  Many  officials  described  NEHI  as  unique  among  interagency 
efforts in terms of its effectiveness. Given limited resources, the development of on-
going  relationships  between  agencies  with  different  missions,  but  compatible  nano-
technology  research  goals,  is  particularly  important.  NIH  officials  commented  that 
their  agency’s  collaboration  with  NIST  to  develop  standard  reference  materials  for 
nanoparticles  may  not  have  occurred  as  readily  had  it  not  been  for  regular  NEHI 
meetings  and  workshops.  In  addition,  NEHI  has  effectively  brought  together  re-
search  and  regulatory  agencies,  which  has  enhanced  planning  and  coordination. 
Many officials noted that participation in NEHI has frequently given regulators the 
opportunity  to  become  aware  of  and  involved  with  research  projects  at  a  very  early 
point  in  their  development,  which  has  resulted  in  research  that  better  suits  the 
needs of regulatory agencies. 

Many  officials  also  cited  the  dedication  of  individual  NEHI  working  group  rep-
resentatives, who participate in the working group in addition to their regular agen-
cy  duties,  as  critical  to  the  group’s  overall  effectiveness.  A  number  of  the  members 
have  served  on  the  body  for  several  years,  providing  stability  and  continuity  that 
contributes  to  a  collegial  and  productive  working  atmosphere.  In  addition,  because 
nanotechnology is relatively new with many unknowns, these officials said the agen-
cies  are  excited  about  advancing  knowledge  about  nanomaterials  and  contributing 
to  the  informational  needs  of  both  regulatory  and  research  agencies.  Furthermore, 
according  to  some  officials,  there  is  a  shared  sense  among  NEHI  representatives  of 
the  need  to  apply  lessons  learned  from  the  development  of  past  technologies,  such 
as genetically modified organisms, to help ensure the safe development and applica-
tion of nanotechnology. 

In  closing,  Mr.  Chairman,  while  nanotechnology  is  likely  to  affect  many  aspects 
of our daily lives in the future as novel drug delivery systems, improved energy stor-
age  capability,  and  stronger,  lightweight  materials  are  developed  and  made  avail-
able, it is essential to consider the potential risks of this technology in concert with 
its potential benefits. Federal funding for studying the potential EHS risks of nano-
technology  is  critical  to  enhancing  our  understanding  of  these  new  materials,  and 
we  must  have  consistent,  accurate,  and  complete  information  on  the  amount  of 
agency  funding  that  is  being  dedicated  to  this  effort.  However,  this  information  is 
not currently available because the totals reported by the NNI include research that 
is more focused on uses for nanotechnology, rather than the risks it may pose. Fur-
thermore,  agencies  currently  have  limited  guidance  on  how  to  report  projects  with 
more  than  one  research  focus  across  program  component  areas,  when  appropriate. 
As  a  result,  the  inventory  of  projects  designed  to  address  these  risks  is  inaccurate 
and cannot ensure that the highest-priority research needs are met. 

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  happy  to  re-

spond to any questions that you and other Members may have. 

Senator KERRY. Well, that’s great. I’d like to pick up on it. 
Senator Stevens has to run in a few minutes. Do you want to ask 

or are you OK? 

Senator STEVENS. I’m OK. 
Senator  KERRY.  OK.  Thanks.  Let  me  follow  up  on  what  you  just 
said  about  the  testimony.  Maybe  I  can  get  you  guys  playing  off 
each other a little bit. 

Director  Robinson,  you  say  that  you  found  this  process  of 
prioritizing the research reasonable but you also found that it falls 
short  of  the  expectations,  and  on  your  score,  Director  Russell,  you 
say  that  the  NNI  Working  Group  has  been  comprehensive  enough 
and we don’t need something further. So there’s a slight divergence 
here and we’re trying to figure out where to go on that path. 

Can you elaborate, Director Robinson, on your views of the strat-
egy  document  and  why  you  don’t  think  it  provides  sufficiently 
prioritized guidance, and then the second part of the question, how, 
because  of  the  lack  of  sufficient  guidance,  that  could  have  an  im-
pact on this discipline and on the future? 

Mr.  ROBINSON.  Yes,  Senator.  Again,  the  process  itself,  it’s  hard 
to  argue  with.  I  mean,  the  folks  are  working  together  quite  well. 
They  sat  down.  They  hashed  out  priorities  across  their  agencies. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:11 May 24, 2012 Jkt 074321 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74321.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

They arrived at a set of 25 needs. There doesn’t seem to be a huge 
amount of contention that these encompass the most important re-
search needs facing this subject. 

The document itself, I’ve got to tell you, the strategy paper itself 
is  a  little  hard  to  follow.  I  mean,  when  you  sit  down  to  try  to  go 
through that, it’s not easy to get through. 

But  on  one  of  the  more  important  fronts,  however,  it  doesn’t  lay 
out  who’s  responsible  for  what,  who’s  accountable  for  delivering 
what,  and  hold  them  responsible  for  delivering  the  research  that 
they’re  supposed  to  do  to  add  up  to  this  collective  whole.  Second-
arily,  it  lays  out  25  or  so  priorities  and  essentially  provides  them 
equal weight. 

So it would be more helpful to know what is the most important 
of the most important in a true budget scarcity environment. Some-
thing has to be sacrificed. 

Senator KERRY. What’s the impact of not knowing? 
Mr. ROBINSON. Well, at the end of the day, I don’t think you can 
be  absolutely  certain  or  the  public  can  be  absolutely  certain  by 
looking  at  that  document  that  the  Federal  Government  has  a  full 
thorough  systematic  effort  in  place  to  ensure  that  nanotechnology 
risks are being fully and completely addressed and that—— 

Senator KERRY. Can I stop you there? Let me stop you there. 
Director Russell, what do you say to that? 
Mr. RUSSELL. So a couple of things. 
Senator KERRY. Can you pull the mike up a little? 
Mr.  RUSSELL.  Sure.  I’ve  got  to  turn  it  on,  too.  A  couple  things. 
One is that there’s no question that we can continue to improve the 
process  by  which  we  identify  from  a  bottom-up  approach  which 
areas  need  to  be  researched  and  how  much  money  we  have  to 
spend in each area. 

The  strategic  document,  which  I  actually  think  is  well  put  to-
gether, is fairly lengthy and quite specific, but it is not a roadmap, 
and  I  think  that’s  maybe  where  there’s  a  difference  between  what 
GAO is saying and what we’re saying. 

The  strategy  is  how  we’re  going  to  move  forward.  I  think  what 
Director  Robinson  is  suggesting  is  what  they  would  love  to  see  as 
an  actual  roadmap.  That  is  something  that  we  certainly  can  look 
at and try to figure out what makes the most sense going forward. 
One of the things that we have done is we’ve asked the National 
Research  Council  to  actually  review  the  strategic  document  and 
give  us  recommendations  and  so  we’re  waiting  for  that  review 
and—— 

Senator KERRY. When will that be forthcoming? 
Mr.  RUSSELL.  I  don’t  know—March  of  next  year  is  when  we’re 

going to get that. 

Senator KERRY. Not till next year? 
Mr. RUSSELL. It takes the NRC awhile to actually—this was pub-
lished—this  document  here,  which  we  are  discussing,  was  pub-
lished  in  February  of  this  year  and  then  the  NRC  has  a  very  spe-
cific series of reviews that it does which takes some time. 

Senator KERRY. Go ahead. 
Senator  STEVENS.  I’ve  got  to  go  but  I  wanted  to  ask  just  two 

questions. 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:11 May 24, 2012 Jkt 074321 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74321.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

30 

Mr.  Russell,  I’m  reminded  of  Norm  Augustine’s  report  that  indi-
cated that in India, they’re producing 700,000 engineers and China 
400,000 engineers and we’re producing 70,000 engineers. 

Now, do we have—how does the amount we’re spending on nano-

technology compare to China and India? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  Well,  we’re  spending  more  than  both  China  and 
India  on  nanotechnology,  although  Asia,  as  a  whole,  is  increasing 
and,  roughly  speaking,  Asia’s  spending  about  the  same  amount 
now we are spending on nanotechnology. So Asia as a whole as op-
posed to those specific two countries. 

Senator  STEVENS.  So  our  lack  of  educational  activities  for  more 
people  is  not  shorting  us  as  far  as  our  basic  research  in  nanotech-
nology? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  Compared  today  to  India  and  China,  that’s  true. 
Now,  I  would  assume,  because  China  is  spending  more  money  ge-
nerically on R&D and ramping up faster than we are over time on 
R&D, that at some point, they probably will end up spending more. 
So that’s clearly something that we need to be cognizant of. 

Senator STEVENS. I think you ought to give us annual reports on 

that. 

Mr.  Robinson,  let  me  ask  you  this.  In  terms  of  your  report  and 
this idea of transparency, do you believe that every one of these re-
search  projects  ought  to  have  a  set-aside  of  money  to  go  into  the 
aspects of safety and health as related to the research project? 

Mr.  ROBINSON.  No,  I  wouldn’t  suggest  that.  My  main  point  is 
that  if  we  say  we’re  spending  X  millions  of  dollars  on  EHS  re-
search,  let’s  make  sure  that  the  money’s  actually  going  in  that  di-
rection and that it will be transparent for what the actual purpose 
of the research is. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Who  is—are  we  supposed  to  have  another 
agency  look  into  the  safety  and  health  aspects  of  nanotechnology? 

Mr. ROBINSON. No, we don’t call for that, Senator, no. 
Senator STEVENS. You don’t—— 
Mr. ROBINSON. We didn’t call for that. We didn’t—— 
Senator  STEVENS.  Who’s  going  to  do  it?  That’s  what  I’m  saying. 
Mr.  ROBINSON.  Well,  the  NNI  Program,  I  think,  right  now  is 
doing a credible job of assembling the research needs and attacking 
most of them. I’m not sure—— 

Senator STEVENS. Including health and safety? 
Mr.  ROBINSON.  Short  of  saying  how—whether  the  dollars  are 
adequate,  I  would  say  the  process  that’s  used  to  arrive  at  and  un-
dertake  the  research  that’s  to  be  undertaken  certainly  is  not  open 
to substantial challenge, I don’t think. 

Senator STEVENS. All right. Thank you. 
Senator KERRY. Yes, Mr. Russell? 
Mr.  RUSSELL.  I  was  just  going  to  jump  in.  I  think  the  answer  is 
that there are a number of different agencies that are all doing this 
research and when you put them all together as coordinated by the 
NNI,  in  the  case  of  Fiscal  Year  2009  request,  you  get  roughly  $75 
million. 

Senator  KERRY.  Why  the  resistance  to  doing  what  people  would 

call a roadmap/comprehensive strategy? Thanks, Ted. 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  I  don’t  think  there’s—it’s  a  matter  of  a  resistance 

in terms of doing it.

31 

Senator  KERRY.  Why  would  there  be  the  automatic  instinct  that 
everybody’s got to know where to go here? I mean, this is the EHS 
concern is real. 

Mr. RUSSELL. No, absolutely. Not only is it—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Don’t  we  want  people  in  the  public  to  have  as 

do it? 

much information and sense of where we’re heading as possible? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  Yes,  absolutely,  and  as  I  was  saying,  what  has 
been  done  to  date,  every  year  the  NNI  has  been  putting  out  more 
detailed and more specific EHS reports and in this case just in Feb-
ruary came up with a strategic plan. 

Creating a roadmap obviously is an additional step and an addi-
tional  work  activity  and  it’s  something  that  we  can  certainly  look 
into doing. It is—— 

Senator  KERRY.  Do  you  agree  that  it  is  the  appropriate  group  to 

Mr. RUSSELL. The NNI? I think—— 
Senator KERRY. Yes. NNI. 
Mr.  RUSSELL.  So  the  NEHI,  which  is  a  subgroup  of  the  Sub-
committee  that’s  responsible  for  dealing  with  the  Nanotechnology 
Program is indeed the right working group to be working on these 
issues and has been very active in working on these issues. So ab-
solutely. 

Senator  KERRY.  Fair  enough.  How  effectively  in  your  judgment, 
Mr. Russell, are we sharing and coordinating this effort with other 
countries? 

Mr. RUSSELL. Actually, I think we’re doing that well. As a matter 
of  fact,  I  think  we  are  doing  more  than  almost  all  other  countries, 
especially and specifically about EHS, but let me give you an exam-
ple. 

Just  this  week,  the  OECD  is  holding  a  meeting  on  this  specific 
issue.  EPA  is  chairing  that  meeting.  It’s  on  Nanotechnology  and 
specifically  EHS  Issues  and  so  we’re  working  very  hard  to  coordi-
nate  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  not  just  on  EHS,  though,  because 
EHS is just one issue with nano. 

Obviously one of the things we want to make sure is that we win 
the  commercialization  battle  as  well  and  there  we’re  working  very 
hard internationally on issues like standards where it’s really crit-
ical  that  we  end  up  with  the  world  adopting  standards  that  are 
beneficial  to  our  companies  just  as  much  as  they  are  good  for  the 
world in terms of new nanotechnology products. 

Senator  KERRY.  Now  let  me  come  to  the  structure  of  this  thing. 
The  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  originally 
called  for  a  National  Nanotechnology  Advisory  Panel  to  the  Presi-
dent and to the whole NNI. 

President  Bush  fought  for  that  authority  to  be  put  into  the 
PCAST,  the  President’s  Council  of  Advisors  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology. 

My  question  to  you  is  isn’t  their  mandate  so  broad  as  a  whole 
that  it  just  doesn’t  have  the  kind  of  specific  expertise  and  knowl-
edge that you want with respect to the nanotechnology sector? 

Mr. RUSSELL. Let me answer that in two ways. One is, one of the 
reasons  the  President  very  much  wanted  PCAST,  which  is  the 
panel  you  just  described,  to  advise  him  on  nanotechnology  is  that 
he actually meets with PCAST on an ongoing basis.

effect. 

PCAST is made up of leading CEOs of tech companies and presi-
dents of universities, very prestigious people. They actually have a 
group  that  advises  them,  what’s  called  a  TAG,  an  advisory  group 
specific to nanotechnology. Those are nanotechnology scientists and 
so those nanotechnology scientists as a fairly large group of people 
are directly advising presidents of universities, the head of the Na-
tional Academy of Engineers, for example, now soon to be our head 
of the Smithsonian, who is currently head of Georgia Tech, as well 
as venture capitalists and presidents of large corporations, who are 
on PCAST, and so really having PCAST review and speak to nano 
really helps in terms of its status within the policymaking process. 
So  I  think  it’s  a  very  useful  function  to  have  PCAST  doing  that. 
Senator  KERRY.  Does  it  stifle  it  in  any  way?  Does  it  cut  it  off? 
Mr. RUSSELL. I don’t think so. I think it has exactly the opposite 

Senator  KERRY.  How  would  you  say  PCAST  has  guided  and  ad-

vised the NNI thus far? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  Well,  it  has  actually  very  directly  interacted  with 
the NNI and directly given advice, written a report. It’s done a very 
good report on the state of technology, nanotechnology, in terms of 
the U.S. and the rest of the world, which has been a very valuable 
document. 

Senator  KERRY.  The  National  Research  Council’s  2006  review 

suggested otherwise a little bit. Are you familiar with it? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  I  am  familiar  with  it.  I  haven’t  looked  at  that  re-

cently. 

Senator KERRY. They found that the NNI does not have the ben-
efit  of  access  to  an  independent  standing  technical  advisory  panel, 
even though there is. I’m quoting them, ‘‘ongoing national need for 
such a body,’’ and they recommended the establishment of an inde-
pendent  advisory  panel  with  specific  operational  expertise  in 
nanoscale science and engineering. 

Why wouldn’t we want to follow that counsel? 
Mr. RUSSELL. Because I think what you will lose by doing that— 
the way the system works now, and I really think it’s been working 
very well, is you have that specific expertise, the expertise that the 
Academy  is  talking  about  which  is  part  of  what’s  called  the  TAG, 
which  is  the  advisory  council,  that  specific  nanotechnology  sci-
entists, to PCAST. 

So  you  have  a  large  number  of  nano  experts  talking  directly  to 
very  well-respected  people,  like  Norm  Augustine,  who  are  on 
PCAST. Having Norm Augustine and others like him talking to the 
President  about  nanotechnology  really  helps  nano.  I  think  we 
would lose a lot if we broke that chain. 

Senator KERRY. Mr. Robinson, do you want to comment? 
Mr. ROBINSON. Senator, this topic is a little bit beyond the scope 

of our initiative, so I wouldn’t have any more to add. 

Senator KERRY. OK. That’s fair. Let me ask either of you if you’d 
like  to  comment  on  this  concept  that  has  been  suggested  to  the 
Committee that part of the problem with the way that the program 
is  currently  constituted  is  that  the  agencies  don’t  have  a  clear 
sense  of  how  to  work  together  in  order  to  maximize  their  budgets, 
maximize  their  resources,  and  make  sure  there’s  a  clear  cut  gov-
ernment-wide strategy for forwarding nanotechnology research.

Is  there  anything  specific  about  the  current  structure  that  you 
think,  as  we  think  about  the  reauthorization,  that  ought  to  be 
changed? Either of you? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  I  must  say,  and  obviously  I  work  with  a  lot  of  dif-
ferent  types  of  interagency  programs,  and  of  the  various  programs 
that have many agencies involved and in this case we have 25 sep-
arate  agencies,  nano  is  one  of  the  best  coordinated  programs  that 
we have in the science arena, and I actually think the GAO report 
really  echoes  that  and  so  I  don’t  think—you  can  always  make  im-
provements,  no  question,  but  I  think  we  want  to  be  really  careful 
that we don’t blow up what has really been a successful model and 
a long-term model. 

I  mean,  you  know,  we’ve  now  been  with  this  model  for  8  years 
and  under  this  model,  we’ve  seen  a  tripling  of  the  budget.  We’ve 
seen the establishment of a national coordinating office. We’ve seen 
the  passage  of  legislation  which  this  Committee  put  forward.  So  I 
think it’s been a successful model. 

Mr.  ROBINSON.  One  thing  I  would  add  to  that  is  I  would  agree 
that, among my 35 years of doing this, this is one of the situations 
when  we  look  at  collaboration  and  where  we’d  have  to  say  this  is 
pretty  good  by  Federal  standards.  Not  the  least  of  which,  it  is  im-
portant  to  mention  that  research  bodies  and  regulatory  bodies  are 
sort  of  working  together,  crossing  normal  sort  of  barriers  and  this 
is a real advantage to this particular operation. 

The  thing  that  we  would  want  to  bring  to  the  dance,  however, 
is  that  at  the  end  of  the  day,  there’s  nobody  ensuring  that  all  the 
work  that’s  supposed  to  be  done  is  orchestrated  in  a  systematic 
fashion  to  reach  conclusion  at  the  same  point  and  address  all  the 
barriers  and  all  the  knowledge  gaps  that  the  public  probably  ex-
pects from its government; that it’s going to protect itself from any 
potential  unintended  ‘‘I  Am  Legend’’  kind  of  consequences  that  I 
think some folks probably have in their minds. 

Senator KERRY. Thank you very much. Senator Thune? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

Senator  THUNE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  thank  you 
for  holding  the  hearing  and  thank  both  the  panels  that  are  testi-
fying,  one  now  and  one  later,  for  their  testimony,  and  I  think  it’s 
important  that  to  keep  our  country  competitive,  we  always  push 
the  boundaries  of  science  in  accordance  with  reasonable  ethical 
standards and public safety measures. 

Nanotechnology  is  the  frontier  of  the  scientific  community  and 
the  U.S.  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  is  an  important  part 
of fully actualizing the benefits of this very exciting technology, and 
as  our  witnesses,  I  think,  are  highlighting,  nanotechnology  is  al-
ready playing a part, an important part in our everyday lives. 

Over the past 14 months, the number of nano-enabled consumer 
products has doubled. Consumers across the country are benefiting 
from this research, even if in many cases they’re unaware of its ori-
gins. 

So  thanks  to  the  investment  of  public  and  private  sector  re-
sources and the ingenuity of America’s scientists, the influence and 
the  benefits  of  nanotechnology  are  going  to  continue  to  lift  the

34 

standard  of  living  for  Americans  and  for  individuals  around  the 
world. 

As  we  move  forward  with  reauthorizing  the  National  Nanotech-
nology  Initiative,  I  think  we  need  to  encourage  greater  focus  on 
safety  and  greater  transparency  within  the  National  Nanotechnol-
ogy  Initiative  and  I  would  also  encourage  my  colleagues  on  the 
Committee to consider an increased role for renewable energy with-
in  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  and  I  again  want  to 
thank  our  witnesses  for  their  testimony,  and  I  look  forward  to 
working  with  my  colleagues  on  the  Committee  as  we  strengthen 
this very important initiative. 

I  guess  I’d  like  to  just  ask  a  couple  of  questions,  if  I  could,  re-
lated  to  agricultural  and  energy  issues.  Agriculture  is  obviously 
very  important  in  my  state  and  advances  in  biotechnology  have 
greatly increased the yields and efficiency of producing many of our 
crops,  and  I  guess  my  question  has  to  do  with  what  advances  do 
you  see  being  made  in  nanotechnology  in  the  agricultural  field? 
How far off are these advances? 

Given the food shortages that are being caused by increasing de-
mand  for  food  abroad?  Do  you  think  we  should  be  directing  more 
funding  toward  the  research  of  nanotechnology  that  will  promote 
agriculture? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  I  can  talk  to  the  energy  field  a  little  more  easily 
than  I  can  talk  directly  to  agriculture.  Clearly,  there  are  benefits 
associated  with  nanotechnology,  and  I  would  think  where  you 
might  see  that  particularly  is  in  things  like  improved  fertilizers 
and improved utilization of nano to create new types of crops. 

But  let  me  give  you  an  energy  example  that  is  real  and  that 
could make a huge difference for all of us and that’s with lighting. 

Senator THUNE. What’s that? 
Mr. RUSSELL. Lighting. Nano-enabled LEDs can be twice as effi-
cient as fluorescent light bulbs and they have none of the real prob-
lems  associated  with  them  and  if  you  look  at  overall  energy  con-
sumption  in  this  country,  lighting  is  a  massive  piece  of  the  puzzle 
and  so  there,  you’re  really  seeing  where  nanotechnology  can  make 
a truly significant difference. 

One  of  the  problems  with  LEDs  is  getting  white  light  and 
through nanotechnology, we can solve that problem and that would 
be  a  real  increase  in  efficiency  and  a  real  decrease  in  our  energy 
need for the country. 

Senator  THUNE.  My  assumption,  based  on  the  answer  to  that 
question, though, is there hasn’t been a lot of thought given to how 
nanotechnology might impact crop production and biotechnology. 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  I  wouldn’t  actually  say  that.  I’m  just  less  familiar 
with  that  area,  but  I’m  happy  to  get  you  examples  for  the  record 
because there is work ongoing in that area as well. 

[The information referred to follows:] 
The  NM  supports  extensive  nanotechnology  R&D  in  biotechnology  and  agri-
culture. For example, the USDA program on Nanoscale Science and Engineering for 
Agriculture and Food Systems aims to develop nanoscale detection and intervention 
technologies for enhancing food safety and agricultural biosecurity; effective delivery 
of  micronutrients  and  bioactive  ingredients  in  foods;  and  product  identification, 
preservation,  and  tracking.  The  program  also  supports  social  science  researches  to 
address  public  perception  and  acceptance  of  nanotechnology  applications  in  agri-
culture and food systems.

The NMI is also supporting research using nano-fabricated surfaces to study how 
certain bacteria affect the water-transporting tissues in plants. The nanotechnology 
approach  enables  the  study  of  the  plants  without  destroying  them,  allowing  collec-
tion of more and better data. Understanding how bacteria colonize these nano-struc-
tured vessels is leading to development of novel plant disease control strategies. 

Senator  THUNE.  Coming  back  to  your  response  about  the  energy 
issue, one of the greatest challenges, I think, that our country faces 
right  now  is  this  dangerous  dependence  that  we  have  on  foreign 
sources  of  energy  and  I  also  believe  that  ethanol  made  from  crops 
and that sort of thing is an immediate solution to this problem and 
one  that  we  need  to  continue  to  develop,  and  I  think  we  have  to 
commercialize  cellulosic  ethanol  as  soon  as  possible  to  meet  that 
growing demand for fuel. 

There’s  a  certain—there’s  a  cap  on  what  we  can  generate  from 
corn.  That  varies.  Most  people  think  somewhere  in  the  15  billion 
gallon  range  and  we  use  about  a  140  billion  gallons  of  fuel  in  this 
country every year. So we’re at about 7.5 billion gallons of produc-
tion  right  now.  So  even  if  we  max  out  what  we  can  do  in  corn, 
we’re still a long ways from having significant impact. 

On  the  other  hand,  when  you  start  getting  into  the  cellulosic 
field, which is advanced biofuels made from other types of biomass, 
switch  grass,  wood  chips,  those  sorts  of  things,  you  can  dramati-
cally  increase  the  amount  of  renewable  energy  that  we  can 
produce,  and  one  of  the  technological  obstacles  to  producing  cellu-
losic ethanol is perfecting the enzymatic reactions that break down 
cellulose to usable sugars that can make ethanol. 

So I guess the question I have is, is there a role for nanotechnol-
ogy in perfecting that process, and has the initiative focused on fuel 
production,  in  addition  to  some  of  the  things  that  you  referenced 
with regard to light? 

Mr. RUSSELL. Again, Senator, I’m happy to get you for the record 
the  specifics  of  what  the  Department  of  Energy  is  doing.  The  De-
partment  of  Energy  is  one  of  the  significant  contributors  to  the 
Nano  Initiative  and  there  is  absolutely  no  question  that  nanotech-
nology—one  of  the  real  breakthroughs  by  using  nano  is  to  reduce, 
for  example,  expensive  catalysts  associated  with  reactions  and  the 
reason for that is pretty clear. 

[The information referred to follows:] 
In  order  to  convert  cellulosic  biomass  (e.g.,  wood,  switchgrass,  corn  stover,  and 
wheat  straw,  and  other  agricultural  and  forest  residues)  into  biofuels,  complex  en-
zymes must break down the cell walls of the feedstock plants. Optimization of these 
enzymes  depends  on  a  detailed  understanding  of  how  they  interact  with  the  plant 
cells  at  the  nanoscale.  As  result,  the  three  new  DOE  Bioenergy  Research  Centers 
are  using  many  of  the  same  tools  used  by  nanoscience  researchers  for  this  aspect 
of their research, including a range of powerful new capabilities for imaging matter 
at the nanoscale. This nanoscale imaging is integrated into a systems approach that 
also  utilizes  a  range  of  other  tools,  including  rapid  genomic  sequencing  and  high- 
throughput  screening,  metagenomics,  and  other  techniques  that  are  specific  to 
genomics-based  systems  biology.  Nanotechnology  tools  are  helpful  in  investigating 
cell-wall physical and chemical properties, how they function, and how certain struc-
tural features inhibit or facilitate enzymatic interactions and subsequent conversion 
to sugar (for eventual conversion by microbes to ethanol as well as to hydrocarbons, 
including ‘‘green’’ gasoline, diesel, and even jet fuel). Specifically, researchers do not 
have a good understanding of the solution physics and thermodynamics that govern 
the  protein-domain  biological  functions  at  the  nanometer  scale.  The  new  tools  of 
nanotechnology  can  help  develop  system-level  descriptions  of  these  processes,  in-
cluding the biomolecular mechanics that govern interactions at the cellulose surface. 
For  example,  DOE  is  using  nanotechnology  tools  to  help  design  enzymes  (biocata-

36 

lysts) that can more efficiently break down cellulosic feedstock into sugar, which can 
then be processed by microbes into ethanol and other fuels, including hydrocarbons. 
This  research  is  being  conducted  by  DOE’s  three  Bioenergy  Research  Centers 
(http://genomicsgthenergy.govicenters/index.shtml), which are led by ORNL, LBNL, 
and Univ. of Wisconsin (in close collaboration with Michigan St.). 

Obviously  when  you  can  distribute  chemicals  at  the  nanoscale, 
you  can  dramatically  reduce  the  amount  of  either  the  toxic  or  the 
expensive catalysts you need for individual reactions. 

So  nanotechnology  has  generically  proven  very  valuable  in  these 
kind of reactions in terms of making them cost effective, which ob-
viously  is  a  huge  part  of  the  equation  when  you’re  talking  about 
cellulosic. It’s not that we don’t know how to do cellulosic, it’s hard 
to do it at scale, it’s hard to do it at a reasonable cost. 

Senator  THUNE.  In  your  reference  to—I  know  the  DOE’s  real  in-
volved  with  this  initiative  which  I  think  is  a  good  thing  because  I 
think  that  the  energy  applications  are  very  real  and  can  be  very 
meaningful. 

How would you rate the coordination among the Federal agencies 
that are involved with the effort? Are there things that can be done 
to improve that? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  Well,  generically  and  this  is  largely  because 
they’ve all bought into the effort itself, it’s excellent. As I stated in 
my  testimony,  we  have  25  agencies  who  are  voluntarily  partici-
pating and the reason that’s important is they all think they’re get-
ting something out of it and since they think they’re getting some-
thing  out  of  it,  they  actually  are  actively  participating  in  the  pro-
gram rather than simply being forced to participate. 

So  for  that  very  reason,  actually  the  interaction  is  excellent  and 
you don’t see the kind of problems you see with coordination where 
agencies  think  that  they’re  either  being  forced  to  do  something  or 
that  another  agency  might  be  stealing  their  budget  and  so  that’s 
really a differentiator in this case and I think it’s worked very well. 
Senator  THUNE.  Thank  you.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank 

you for your testimony. 

Senator  KERRY.  Thank  you  very  much,  Senator  Thune.  Just  a 
last  question  quickly.  Tell  America  what  you  think.  What  are  we 
looking at here? What do you see the future of nanotechnology con-
ceivably providing? Are there areas where you see the most impact, 
perhaps the products and types of things that will be most exciting 
to Americans? 

Mr.  RUSSELL.  Well,  I  think  there  will  be  a  variety  of  areas  and 
that’s one of the wonderful things about nanotechnology because it 
really  crosscuts  almost  all  the  areas  you  can  imagine  in  terms  of 
commercializable products. 

Clearly,  today,  biomedical  is  an  amazing  and  a  growing  field. 
Just  today  in  the  Washington  Post,  in  the  Business  section,  they 
had  a  very  interesting  article  about  cancer  fighting  drugs  that  can 
be targeted through nanoparticles directly at just the cancer. 

You’re  seeing  similar  breakthroughs  with  replacing  bones,  mak-
ing  bone  screws  out  of  actual  bone,  and  other  advances  in  the  bio-
medical field, and in other areas, like coatings, there is tremendous 
current work going on where you’re seeing much stronger and bet-
ter and longer-lasting coatings.

37 

Also  in  the  environmental  field,  and  this  goes  to  GAO’s  point 
that  about  $7  million  of  pro-environment  research  was  categorized 
as  environmental  impacts,  nanotechnology,  because  it  can  reduce 
the  waste  stream,  because  we  can  use  less  of  dangerous  products, 
not  just  expensive  products,  in  terms  of  how  we  manufacture 
things can make a real difference in terms of the amount of waste 
that’s produced that’s produced when we are producing things. 

So  I  think  those  are  some  of  the  many  areas  you’re  going  to  see 
breakthroughs.  The  other  is  in  materials  and  having  stronger, 
lighter materials which again saves energy and allows us to do all 
sorts of interesting things is clearly an area where nanotechnology 
has really taken off. 

Mr.  ROBINSON.  And  I  would  agree,  you  know,  beyond  the  bio-
medical  front,  obviously  the  energy  potential,  if  you  can  develop 
these  nano-based  thin  photovoltaics  that  essentially  can  be  incor-
porated into windows, paints, roofs that make every house its own 
energy generator, I mean phenomenal potential there. 

But referencing back to Senator Thune’s point, one of the things 
that  we  want  to  make  sure  in  our  work  which  was  indeed  con-
centrated on EHS issues, we want to make sure that we don’t have 
a  repeat  similar  to  biotech  crops  where  the  public’s  confidence  or 
at least other potential buyers’ confidence was shaken and it dam-
aged our ability to enter the marketplace and that is sort of at the 
root of this effort. 

We need to make sure that everything’s aboveboard, transparent 
and,  as  best  we  can  determine,  all  the  risks  are  identified  and  at-
tacked  in  the  most  systematic  efficient  way  possible,  and  that’s  at 
the root of our testimony today. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  I  appreciate  it.  We  appreciate  your  testi-
mony  today.  I’m  going  to  leave  the  record  open  for  a  couple  of 
weeks  in  the  event  any  other  colleagues  have  any  questions  they 
want  to  submit  in  writing,  but  we  thank  you  for  coming  today. 
Thank  you  for  the  analysis.  Thank  you,  Director  Russell,  for  your 
help in understanding this as we go forward. 

Mr. RUSSELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

ward right away and we’ll get started? Appreciate that.

STATEMENT OF MATTHEW M. NORDAN, PRESIDENT, 

LUX RESEARCH, INC. 

Mr.  NORDAN.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman.  Lux  Research  ad-

vises corporations and investors on the unique perspective—— 

Senator  KERRY.  Advises  about  the  unique  perspectives  of  nano-

technology? 

Mr. NORDAN. Commercialization. 
Senator KERRY. Commercialization. 
Mr. NORDAN. On the basic measure of scientific output, the NNI 
has  been  a  great  success.  The  $7.2  billion  that  it  has  channeled 
since launch has funded prodigious research in areas ranging from 
noninvasive  cancer  therapies  to  high-efficiency  solar  panels,  but 
more  than  this,  the  NNI  has  catalyzed  a  virtuous  cycle  of  innova-
tion. 

The  NNI  has  excited  corporate  interest  in  nanotech.  It  helped 
spark  $2.4  billion  in  private  R&D  spending  on  the  topic  last  year 
which  exceeded  government  funding  by  23  percent.  Stimulated  by 
the  NNI,  venture  capitalists  have  opened  their  checkbooks.  Last 
year,  VC  funding  for  U.S.-based  nanotech  startups  totaled  $632 
million.  That’s  four  times  the  figure  in  the  year  before  the  NNI, 
and  finally,  NNI-funded  initiatives  have  sparked  new  enthusiasm 
about the physical sciences broadly among students, from the post-
graduate level down to high school. 

Nanotechnology  is  now  having  a  significant  commercial  impact. 
Because  nanotech  is  a  toolkit  that’s  being  deployed  behind  the 
scenes in virtually every manufacturing industry, it can seem invis-
ible.  There’s  an  all-too-commonly  held  misperception  that  all  we 
have to show for our nanotech funding is stain-resistant pants but 
this view is dead wrong. 

From the billions of dollars in nano-enabled pharmaceuticals sold 
last  year  by  the  likes  of  Abbott  to  the  nanocomposites  in  coatings, 
the  chip  in  millions  of  vehicles  from  General  Motors,  nanotech  is 
on  track  to  exceed  my  firm’s  projection  of  enabling  $2.6  trillion  in 
goods sold by 2014, about 15 percent of manufacturing output. 

Nanotech  is  also  creating  new  companies  and  new  jobs.  In  my 
home  state  of  Massachusetts,  the  Arsenal  Complex  in  the  City  of 
Watertown  was  750,000  square  feet  of  empty  crumbling  space  in 
the mid 1990s, but now its biggest tenant is A1–2–3 Systems which 
manufactures  high-performance  batteries  with  nano-structured 
electrodes based on research by Yet Ming-Chiang at MIT, precisely 
the  type  of  work  that  the  NNI  funds.  In  four  short  years,  A1–2– 
3 has gone from a few dozen employees to more than 1,000 and it’s 
helped  to  shift  the  center  of  battery  innovation  from  East  Asia  to 
the U.S. 

Now  my  company  conducts  an  annual  assessment  of  inter-
national  competitiveness  in  nanotech.  We  rank  19  nations  world-
wide. On an absolute basis, the U.S. remains the world leader, but 
the  U.S.  does  not  lead  and  not  by  a  long  stretch  when  the  size  of 
our economy is taken into account. 

For  instance,  when  you  look  at  government  funding  on  an  abso-
lute basis, the U.S. topped the charts last year, but when the same 
figures  are  considered  on  a  per  capita  basis  at  purchasing  power 
parity,  the  U.S.  takes  eighth  place  with  funding  half  that  of  Tai-
wan and behind Germany, Sweden and France.

Other  nations  are  gaining  rapidly.  Nanotech  funding  is  growing 
in  the  EU  at  twice  our  rate.  Russia  recently  funded  a  state  nano-
technology  corporation  with  $5  billion  of  public  financing  and  the 
citation rate of nanotech journal articles in China, which is a meas-
ure of their quality, has doubled in the last decade. 

Now with these facts in mind, the NNI should certainly be reau-
thorized  but  as  nanotech  shifts  from  discovery  to  commercializa-
tion, change is required. Most of the changes that will help transi-
tion NNI-funded research to market really have nothing to do with 
nanotechnology  in  particular.  They  address  broader  issues.  This 
should come as no surprise given nanotech’s diversity and breadth. 
For  example,  rapidly  growing  companies  need  skilled  human  cap-
ital.  This  means  major  new  investment  in  science  and  technology 
training  for  U.S.  students,  as  Senator  Stevens  referred  to,  but  it 
also  requires  easing  the  visa  process  for  foreign  nationals  and  ex-
panding the H1V program. 

Recall  A1–2–3  Systems.  Had  Yet  Ming-Chiang  returned  to  his 
native country, its 1,000 employees might well be in Taiwan. Start- 
ups  that  want  to  access  public  markets  face  immense  administra-
tive costs to comply with regulations like Sarbanes-Oxley. Reducing 
these  costs  will  unshackle  them.  We  should  note  that  of  14 
nanotech startups that have gone public to date, most of them have 
done  so  on  foreign  exchanges  where  the  cost  of  doing  business  is 
much lower. 

Finally,  Congress  can  introduce  financial  mechanisms  that  help 
small  companies  collaborate  with  big  ones.  This  is  particularly  im-
portant in nanotech by, for example, enabling small firms to trans-
fer their net operating losses to corporate partners. 

There  are,  however,  a  number  of  smaller  changes  specific  to 
nanotech  that  are  also  necessary.  I’ll  focus  on  two.  First,  a  reau-
thorized  NNI  should  fund  not  just  basic  research  but  also 
precompetitive  R&D  into  nanomaterials  application  development 
and manufacturing scale-up. 

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Nano  Manufacturing  Initiative  is  a 

model case study for this. 

Second,  a  reauthorized  NNI  must  address  potential  environ-
mental  health  and  safety  risks  as  we’ve  discussed  much  more  ag-
gressively,  bringing  regulatory  clarity  to  companies  that  are  beg-
ging  for  it  and  presenting  a  comprehensive  interagency  roadmap 
for EHS research. 

I  appreciate  your  inviting  me  here  to  speak.  I’m  confident  that 
with  your  informed  decisions  the  next  7  years  of  the  NNI  will  be 
even brighter than the first seven. 

I’m pleased to answer any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MATTHEW M. NORDAN, PRESIDENT, LUX RESEARCH, INC. 
The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)  is  a  great  success;  it  has  not  only 
funded  prodigious  fundamental  research,  but  has  also  catalyzed  a  virtuous  cycle  of 
innovation  manifested  in  corporate  R&D  and  venture  capital.  The  landscape  is  dif-
ferent today than when the NNI commenced in 2001, however. Nanotech’s discovery 
phase has given way to commercialization—tens of billions of dollars worth of prod-
ucts  now  incorporate  nanotech—and  other  nations  are  eroding  the  U.S.’s  dominant 
position.  As  the  NNI  is  reauthorized,  its  focus  should  shift  to  application  develop-
ment  and  manufacturing  scale-up—and  its  approach  to  environmental,  health,  and 
safety (EHS) issues must be overhauled.

The NNI Has Catalyzed a Virtuous Cycle of Innovation 

Nanotechnology is the purposeful engineering of matter at scales of less than 100 
nanometers  (nm)  to  achieve  size-dependent  properties  and  functions.  Nanotech  is 
not a new industry or market, but rather an enabling set of technologies that impact 
a wide variety of industries through a nanotech value chain. This value chain starts 
with  nanomaterials  like  carbon  nanotubes  and  dendrimers,  which  are  incorporated 
into intermediate products like memory chips and drug delivery systems, which are 
in turn used to make enhanced final goods like mobile phones and cancer therapies 
(see  Figure  1).  Lux  Research  projects  that  new,  emerging  nanotechnology  applica-
tions  will  affect  nearly  every  type  of  manufactured  product  through  the  middle  of 
the next decade, becoming incorporated into 15 percent of global manufacturing out-
put totaling $2.6 trillion in 2014 (see Figures 2 and 3).1

Introduced  in  2001  and  signed  into  law  in  2003,  the  U.S.  National  Nanotechnol-
ogy Initiative is the Federal Government’s coordinating program for publicly-funded 
nanotechnology  research,  which  has  inspired  similar  efforts  in  countries  worldwide 
from  Germany  to  South  Korea.  By  the  core  measure  of  scientific  output,  the  NNI 
has  been  a  great  success—U.S.  scientists  have  published  55,661  journal  articles  on 
nanoscale  science  and  engineering  since  2001,  27  percent  of  the  world’s  total.  But 
in  addition  to  this,  the  very  presence  of  the  NNI  has  catalyzed  a  virtuous  cycle  of 
innovation, manifested in: 

• Corporate  R&D  spending.  Large  U.S.  corporations  from  GE  to  Motorola  spent 
$2.4  billion  in  nanotechnology  R&D  in  2007,  up  22  percent  from  2006  and  557 
percent from 2000, the year before the NNI’s introduction. The 2007 figure was 
23 percent higher than U.S. Government nanotechnology funding at the Federal 
and  state  level  combined.2 These  efforts  include  in-house  research  like  GE’s 
Nanotechnology Advanced Technology Program, broad collaborations like Cabot 
Corporation’s Fine Particle Network, and joint ventures like DA Nanomaterials, 
created  by  DuPont  and  Air  Products.  Without  the  NNI  as  a  widely-publicized 
focusing  mechanism  for  nanotechnology  research,  it’s  unlikely  that  this  intense 
corporate  focus  on  nanoscale  science  and  engineering  would  have  materialized. 
• Venture capital (VC) funding. Venture capitalists are always on the lookout for 
compelling investment themes, as well as non-dilutive sources of financing that 
can  help  sustain  the  companies  they  invest  in  through  notoriously  rocky  early 
stages. The NNI has provided both, serving as a validator that has helped open 
VCs’  wallets  to  materials  science  investments  in  a  fashion  never  before  seen. 
In  2007  VC  firms  put  $632  million  into  U.S.-based  nanotech  start-ups  in  2007, 
more  than  four  times  the  figure  in  the  year  before  the  NNI  was  initiated  (see 
Figure 4).3

• New  companies  and  new  jobs.  Consider  A123Systems,  which  uses  nanostruc-
tured  lithium  iron  phosphate  electrodes  to  make  advanced  batteries  now  being 
evaluated  for  use  in  electric  vehicles  like  GM’s  Chevy  Volt.  In  the  mid–1990s, 
the  Arsenal  complex  in  the  City  of  Watertown,  Massachusetts  was  750,000 
square feet of empty, crumbling space. Now, A123Systems is its biggest tenant, 
commercializing  battery  devices  based  on  research  by  Yet-Ming  Chiang  at 
MIT—precisely  the  type  of  research  that  the  NNI  funds.  In  just  4  years,  A123 
has  gone  from  a  few  dozen  employees  to  more  than  1,000—and  helped  to  shift 
the center of battery innovation from east Asia to the United States. 

The  Nanotech  Landscape  Is  Very  Different  Today  than  When  the  NNI 

Launched 

When the NNI took shape in 2001, nanotechnology activity focused on early-stage 
laboratory  research  with  little  commercial  impact,  and  the  U.S.  was  alone  in  the 
world  in  having  a  nationwide  coordinating  program  for  nanotech.  Today,  both  fac-
tors  have  changed.  Nanotechnology  has  shifted  from  its  discovery  phase  into  its 
commercialization  phase—and  at  the  same  time,  the  dominant  competitive  position 
of the United States has been eroded by other nations. 
Nanotech Commercialization is Eclipsing Discovery 

In  the  last  7  years,  emerging  nanotechnology  has  increasingly  become  a  fact  of 
life  and  of  business,  as  the  technology  has  shifted  from  an  era  of  discovery  to  one 
of  commercialization.  In  this  fashion,  nanotechnology  follows  the  example  of  other 
world-changing  technologies  like  polymer  science  and  biotechnology.  For  these 
emerging technologies, everything starts with the discovery phase—a period of basic 
research  and  application  development—which  has  a  characteristic  time  span,  give 
or  take  a  bit,  of  about  20  years.  It’s  then  that  a  tipping  point  gets  reached,  trig-
gering  the  commercialization  phase—where  the  technology’s  long-term  impact  is 
manifested (see Figure 5).

For  instance,  plastics’  discovery  phase  started  in  the  1920s,  when  scientist  Wal-
lace  Corrothers  at  DuPont  began  work  on  synthesizing  nylon.  In  1937,  he  was 
issued  his  patent  on  the  material.  Two  years  afterward—about  20  years  after  dis-
covery began—American women bought 64 million pairs of nylon stockings; once the 
commercialization  threshold  was  reached,  it  took  off  fast.  In  biotechnology,  James 
Watson  and  Francis  Crick  characterized  DNA  in  1953,  and  20  years  later,  right  on 
cue, Stanley Cohen and Robert Boyer applied genetic engineering techniques to syn-
thesize insulin for the first time. Genentech, the first biotech start-up, was founded 
in 1976, and commercialization has since skyrocketed: In 2006, revenues of publicly- 
traded  biotech  companies  topped  $65  billion.  In  information  technology,  Vint  Cerf 
and  Robert  Kahn  proposed  the  Internet  protocol  in  1974.  The  number  of  Internet 
users grew gradually to the single-digit millions up through 1993, but began to sky-
rocket  in  about  1994,  the  year  Netscape’s  browser  was  released—reinventing  com-
munication and commerce in the process. 

Nanotech’s  discovery  phase  started  in  the  mid–1980s  with  the  invention  of  scan-
ning  probe  microscopes  that  enabled  scientists  to  visualize  matter  at  the  nanoscale 
for  the  first  time.  Innovations  have  reached  the  market  in  electronics,  as 
A123Systems’ nanostructured battery electrodes appeared on store shelves in Black 
& Decker’s Dewalt line of power tools; in healthcare, as nanoparticulate drug refor-
mulations  like  Abbott’s  cholesterol  drug  Tricor  have  found  their  way  into  doctors’ 
repertoire;  and  in  materials  and  manufacturing,  as  PPG’s  coatings  have  improved 
the  performance  of  millions  of  automobiles.  According  to  our  research,  approxi-
mately $88 billion in manufacturing output worldwide incorporated emerging nano-
technology in 2007. 
The Dominant Position of the U.S. Is Being Eroded 

Each year, Lux Research conducts an annual assessment of international competi-
tiveness  in  nanotechnology,  ranking  19  nations  worldwide  on  their  nanotechnology 
activity  and  technology  commercialization  strength.  On  an  absolute  basis,  the  U.S. 
remains the world leader in nanotech. Two factors, however, should give U.S. policy-
makers pause: 

• The  U.S.  does  not  lead  on  a  relative  basis.  Relative  to  our  population  and  the 
size  of  our  economy,  the  U.S.  pales  in  comparison  to  other  countries  when  it 
comes  to  nanotechnology  activity.  For  example,  when  government  funding  is 
considered  on  an  absolute  basis,  the  U.S.  topped  the  charts  in  2007.  However,

when the same figures are considered on a per capita basis at purchasing power 
parity,  the  U.S.  takes  eighth  place,  with  funding  half  that  of  Taiwan,  and  be-
hind Germany, Sweden, and France (see Figure 6).4 

• Other  countries  are  catching  up.  Since  we  began  performing  our  international 
competitiveness  rankings  in  2005,  the  position  of  the  U.S.  has  remained  static 
while  other  countries  have  vaulted  upwards  in  their  nanotechnology  activity 
(see  Figure  7).  For  example,  nanotech  funding  is  growing  in  the  EU  at  twice 
the  rate  in  the  United  States,  putting  the  EU  on  track  to  claim  the  mantle  of 
nanotechnology leadership due to a renewed focus on nanoscale science and en-
gineering in the 7th Framework Programme for research. Russia recently fund-
ed  a  state  nanotechnology  corporation  with  $5  billion  of  public  financing.  And 
scientists  in  China  published  nearly  as  many  scientific  journal  articles  on 
nanoscale science and engineering in 2007 as those in the U.S. did, at 7,282 to 
7,528  (see  Figure  8).  While  the  quality  of  these  publications  has  been  suspect 
in  the  past,  the  citation  rate  of  nanotech  journal  articles  from  China—a  meas-
ure of their quality—has doubled in the last decade.5

A  Commercially-Dominated  Landscape  Requires  Change  to  Unlock  the 

NNI’s Value 

Clearly,  the  NNI  should  be  reauthorized.  But  in  the  context  of  growing  nanotech 
commercialization  and  increased  international  competitiveness,  the  onus  is  on  Con-
gress  to  eliminate  roadblocks  to  market  introduction  for  nanotechnology  applica-
tions.  Most  of  these  changes  are  not  specific  to  nanotech,  although  a  few  key  ones 
are. 
Nanotech’s Pervasiveness Means that Most Required Changes are General 

Many  of  the  changes  that  will  help  transition  NNI-funded  research  to  market 
have  nothing  to  do  with  nanotechnology  specifically,  but  address  broader  issues  in 
technology  commercialization.  Given  nanotechnology’s  diversity,  and  the  breadth  of 
product categories that it touches, this is to be expected: As goes technology in gen-
eral, so goes nanotech. These changes include:

• Attracting  U.S.  students  to  science  and  engineering,  and  retaining  foreign  ones. 
Funding  for  nanotechnology  R&D  will  amount  to  nothing  without  a  steady 
stream  of  trained  scientists  and  engineers  entering  the  work  force.  The  U.S. 
should  strengthen  programs  designed  to  inspire  students  with  wonder  for  the 
physical  sciences  in  K–12  and  undergraduate  education  to  nurture  homegrown 
talent.  But  it  should  also  reconsider  the  effect  of  visa  tightening  on  the  inflow 
of  foreign  science  and  technology  graduate  students,  and  expands  H1-B  visa 
programs  to  allow  students  that  have  earned  advanced  degrees  in  science  and 
engineering  in  the  U.S.  to  remain  here—rather  than  repatriating  taking  with 
them the skills they acquired in the U.S. The lesson of A123Systems is instruc-
tive:  Had  Yet  Ming-Chiang  returned  to  his  native  country,  its  1,000  employees 
would likely be in Taiwan. 
• Reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business  for  start-ups  seeking  public  markets.  Start- 
up companies looking to make initial public offerings (IPOs) on the public mar-
kets face immense administrative costs to comply with regulations such as Sar-
banes-Oxley.  Easing  these  burdens  will  unshackle  them.  It’s  important  to  note 
that  of  the  14  nanotech  start-ups  that  have  gone  public,  most  have  done  so  on 
foreign exchanges where the cost of doing business is lower. 
• Introducing financial mechanisms to encourage collaboration between small and 
large firms. Nanotechnology commercialization has followed a pattern similar to 
biotech,  in  which  small,  innovative  companies  develop  breakthrough  tech-
nologies  that  incumbent  corporations  bring  to  market:  Silver  nanoparticle  anti-
microbial  company  Nucryst  Pharmaceuticals  relied  on  wound  care  dressing 
maker Smith & Nephew to get to market, while A123Systems found its partner 
in Black & Decker. Congress can grease the wheels of nanotechnology commer-
cialization by creating financial mechanisms that help small firms to collaborate 
effectively  with  large  ones.  One  example  of  such  a  measure  would  be  enabling 
small  companies  to  transfer  their  net  operating  losses  to  their  corporate  part-
ners—allowing  those  partners  to  reap  the  tax  benefits  of  research  investments, 
which the loss-making smaller companies can’t claim. 

A Few Nanotech-Specific Changes Are Necessary 

In  addition  to  these  general  reforms,  a  smaller  number  of  changes  specific  to 
nanotech are also required. There are two specific actions we think Congress should 
take now: 

• Shift  some  of  NNI’s  focus  to  application  development  and  manufacturing  scale- 
up.  A  reauthorized  NNI  should  focus  on  not  just  on  basic  research,  but  also  on 
precompetitive  R&D  into  nanomaterials  application  development  and  manufac-
turing  scale-up.  Currently  the  technical  challenges  that  are  limiting  nanotech 
commercialization  are  not  as  much  in  synthesizing  nanomaterials  or  under-
standing their fundamental properties as in learning how to integrate them into 
products  and  manufacturing  them  economically  in  large  volumes.  The  Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  Nanomanufacturing  initiative,  run  out  of  its  Industrial  Tech-
nology Program, is a model case study—it aims to introduce shared Nanomanu-
facturing centers as pilot facilities on the model of the NNI’s existing user cen-
ters for nanoscale analytical equipment. 
• Take a completely different approach to environmental, health, and safety (EHS) 
issues. In our work with companies looking to take advantage of nanotech inno-
vation, the single concern that comes up more than any other is potential EHS 
risks of nanomaterials. While it’s of course incumbent on companies developing 
nano-enabled  products  to  test  their  own  products  to  ensure  safety,  there’s  an 
important  role  for  government  to  play  in  resolving  these  concerns—by  funding 
basic  research  on  nanomaterials  EHS  risk  that  no  individual  firm  can  afford, 
and  by  establishing  clear  regulatory  guidelines  for  companies  working  with 
nanomaterials. 
On the first point, the NNI should be generously funding basic research on the 
EHS  risks  of  nanomaterials—just  as  NNI-funded  research  on  nanoscience  has 
supported  deployment  of  real-world  nanotech  applications,  the  results  of  NNI- 
funded  EHS  work  would  help  companies  complete  their  own  EHS  evaluations. 
Unfortunately,  funding  levels  remain  too  low  to  have  the  desired  impact,  and, 
even  more  critically,  the  NNI  has  never  effectively  addressed  EHS  issues  sur-
rounding nanotech with a comprehensive, interagency plan for required EHS re-
search.  The  Nanotechnology  Environmental  and  Health  Implications  (NEHI) 
Working  Group  report  on  EHS  issues  has  not  filled  this  gap—it  fails  to 
prioritize specific materials and applications for research, avoiding the tradeoffs 
that  are  inherent  in  any  meaningful  strategy—and  the  EPA’s  internal  review 
of  its  own  nanomaterials  EHS  activities,  by  definition,  does  not  cross  agencies.

This lack of coordination is hampering development, and must change. The best 
way to move forward on this front would be to execute the nanomaterials EHS 
strategy by the National Academies’ Board on Environmental Studies and Toxi-
cology—Congress  has  already  appropriated  funds  for  this  study,  but  the  work 
has not yet been started. 
Second,  ambiguity  surrounding  how  nanomaterials  will  be  regulated  must  be 
dispelled. It’s still often not clear how current regulations apply to nanoparticles 
or  whether  and  when  agencies  will  issue  new  ones—leaving  firms  that  work 
with nanomaterials confused about how to plan for regulatory rulings. The com-
panies  we  speak  with  are  actually  eager  for  appropriate  regulatory  guidance 
about nanomaterials, to ensure a level playing field and to help them guarantee 
the  safety  of  workers,  consumers,  and  the  environment.  While  companies  are 
generally  pleased  about  how  the  EPA,  for  example,  has  communicated  with 
them  so  far,  they’re  also  frustrated  by  how  slow  those  agencies  have  been  to 
set  specific  guidance,  as  witnessed  by  the  glacial  pace  of  the  EPA’s  voluntary 
Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program. Seven years after the NNI’s launch, 
it’s  still  unclear  to  most  commercial  entities  when  and  how  the  materials  they 
work with will be treated under the EPA’s Toxic Substances Control Act—form-
ing a real commercialization gating factor. 

At  Lux  Research,  we  applaud  the  efforts  that  have  taken  place  so  far  under  the 
National  Nanotechnology  Initiative,  which  have  made  the  U.S.  a  world  leader  in 
nanotechnology  and  are  bringing  real  economic  benefits  to  our  Nation.  We’re  con-
fident that a renewed NNI, with adjustments like those outlined above, will increase 
these benefits—and enable nanotechnology to help address the challenges the coun-
try faces in combating disease, moving toward energy independence, and sustaining 
economic growth. 

Senator KERRY. Thank you very much, Mr. Nordan. Very helpful. 
Mr. Rejeski? 

STATEMENT OF DAVID REJESKI, DIRECTOR, PROJECT ON 

EMERGING NANOTECHNOLOGIES, WOODROW WILSON 

INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR SCHOLARS 

Mr. REJESKI. Chairman Kerry, I’d like to thank you for the invi-

tation to talk directly to you and also to the Committee. 

I  appeared  before  this  Committee  about  2  years  ago  and  today 
what  I  would  like  to  do  is  address  what’s  changed  since  that  time 
I appeared here, what hasn’t and what I believe must if nanotech-
nology commercialization is going to be successful in the future. 

Let  me  begin  by  providing  an  update  on  the  state  of  commer-
cialization  of  nano-based  products.  Two  years  ago,  we  had  230 
manufacturer-identified nano-enabled consumer products in our in-
ventory. The number is now exceeding 600. It’s doubled in the last 
14  months  with  products  from  essentially  320  companies  and  20 
countries. 

The main nano-engineered material in these products is now sil-
ver  which  is  used  in  over  a  140  products,  such  as  this  nano-silver 
toothpaste,  which  is  from  Korea  and  we  bought  in  Gaithersburg.  I 
would  not  use  this  because  I  don’t  really  know  what  the  risks  are 
and I’ll guarantee you nobody in our Government knows. 

The other thing that’s happened is the—— 
Senator KERRY. What kind of toothpaste? 
Mr. REJESKI. —nano-silver. 
Senator KERRY. What is nano-silver? 
Mr.  REJESKI.  Essentially  the  toothpaste  has  been—there’s  nano- 
silver  in  this  and  it’s  nanoscale  that’s  introduced  as  an  anti-
microbial. So it’s designed to have significant antimicrobial powers 
once  it’s  put  in  your  mouth.  It  obviously  raises  issues  about  what

does  it  do  when  you  swallow  it.  If  I  have  periodontal  disease,  you 
know, is it going to into the bloodstream, et. cetera? 
Senator KERRY. Does it say on the tube what it is? 
Mr. REJESKI. Well, it’s in Korean. 
Senator KERRY. It’s in Korean? 
Mr. REJESKI. Yes. That presents a problem. 
Senator KERRY. You bought it where? 
Mr.  REJESKI.  Gaithersburg.  And,  you  know,  we’ve  got—right 
now,  there  are  nine  toothpastes  that  contain  nano-engineered  ma-
terials in the U.S. marketplace. 

Senator  KERRY.  What  are  they,  just  out  of  interest?  Do  you 

Mr. REJESKI. It’s largely antimicrobial silvers and also whitening 
calcium peroxide, but again, you know, the issue is obviously who’s 
tested  this,  you  know,  what  are  some  of  the  risks.  It’s  out  there. 
Consumers can buy it. 

Senator KERRY. Well, that applies to about 75,000 chemicals that 

know? 

are in the marketplace. 

Mr.  REJESKI.  Right.  Yes.  We’re  just  adding  nano  to  the  long  list 

of other chemicals that we know very little about. 
Senator KERRY. Would that fall under TOSCA? 
Mr. REJESKI. This probably would fall partially under FDA regu-
lation, though the actual chemical inputs would fall under TOSCA. 
Senator  KERRY.  It’s  an  interesting  question  as  to  where  that  li-

ability lies, but we’ll look at that. Go ahead. 

Mr. REJESKI. Let me just continue with some other observations. 
I’d say that the area where the largest market penetration is are 

also areas where we have the weakest—— 

Senator KERRY. Your smile is radiating, I want you to know. 
Mr. REJESKI. Well, we can pass this around. 
Senator KERRY. Geiger counter. 
Mr.  REJESKI.  So  a  lot  of  the  products  are  penetrating  in  areas 
where  we  really  don’t  have  significant  oversight,  such  as  the  Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission, which spent about $20,000 last 
year doing a literature research on nanotech. That’s out of our $1.5 
billion NNI. 

I  think  the  other  thing  I  want  to  talk  about  is  the  fact  that  the 
American  consumer  learned  a  painful  lesson  last  year  and  that’s 
that  the  oversight  system  in  this  country  is  failing.  The  public’s 
had  to  deal  with  lead  in  toys  that  was  banned  30  years  ago,  rat 
poison  in  pet  food,  antifreeze  additives  in  toothpaste,  E.coli  in 
meat.  These  are  not  novel  toxins.  So  consumers  are  nervous,  our 
surveys  show  it,  and  so  are  other  people  that  are  going  to  be,  I 
think, critical to nanotech commercialization. 

The  financial  community  is  taking  another  look  at  nanotech.  A 
number of insurance companies have now placed nanotechnology in 
their  top  category  of  emerging  risks.  I  talked  last  month  to  people 
at  Lloyd’s  of  London  and  they  basically  said  there  are  two  things 
that are critical to reducing risks with nanotech: transparency and 
oversight and regulation. We have none of those. 

State  and  local  governments  are  moving  to  provide  their  own 
guidance  to  nanotech  firms.  We’ve  seen  that  in  Berkeley,  Cali-
fornia.  We’re  going  to  see  it  shortly  in  Cambridge,  Massachusetts, 
and the State of Wisconsin is doing some work.

I think NGO positions are hardening. A recent report by Friends 
of  The  Earth  called  for  a  total  moratorium  on  the  use  of  nano  in 
all foods and food packaging. I think if there was ever a honeymoon 
with  the  NGO’s,  it  is  over,  and  I  think  that’s  something  that  the 
Government has squandered over the past 2 years. 

Finally,  the  actual  firms,  especially  small  firms,  are  nervous  be-
cause  they  lack  clear  guidance  from  the  Government.  One  senior 
safety  manager  at  a  Massachusetts  corporation  told  us,  ‘‘At  this 
time,  we  don’t  understand  what  regulatory  requirements  may  be 
uniquely applicable to nanotech.’’ 

These problems do not bode well for nanotech commercialization. 
So  let  me  talk  a  little  bit  about  what  hasn’t  changed  and  I  think 
what needs to be done as the Congress turns their attention to the 
reauthorization  of  what  I  hope  they  will  call  the  21st  Century 
Nanotechnology  R&D  and  Commercialization  Act  because  that’s 
what it’s all about now. 

The  three  areas  are  critical.  The  first,  the  GAO  mentioned,  is 
transparency.  The  reauthorization  bill  must  make  the  NNI  fully 
transparent and accountable in terms of investments to address the 
risks.  Public  confidence  in  nanotech  can’t  be  built  on  hidden  agen-
das or exaggerated numbers and we believe a separate external ad-
visory board needs to be essentially established to provide guidance 
and oversight for the NNI. 

Strategy.  We  need  a  comprehensive  strategy,  Congress  has  been 
waiting  few  years  for  this,  that  addresses  existing  and  emerging 
risks,  sets  governmentwide  priorities,  ties  funding  levels  to  prior-
ities  and  ensures  that  the  right  that  the  right  risks  are  being  ad-
dressed  by  the  right  agencies  at  the  right  time  in  the  R&D  com-
mercialization cycle. 

The  strategy  also  needs  a  minimum  funding  level  for  nano-re-
lated EHS research, order of magnitude increases for EHS funding 
at  our  key  regulatory  agencies.  That  includes  EPA,  FDA,  USDA, 
and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 

We  need  to  provide  public-private  partnerships  and  we  need 

funding and a strategy for clean and green nanotech. 

The  final  area  is  engagement.  Public  awareness  of  nanotech  is 
stuck  at  a  low  level.  We  haven’t  moved  the  awareness  meter  or 
nanometer  in  the  past  few  years  compared  to  basically  where  we 
started. 

The Federal Government has no strategy to engage the public at 
a  wider  level  and  fill  the  knowledge  gaps  about  nanotech  and  I 
think that’s going to have serious implications essentially for long- 
term success. This needs to be remedied—— 

Senator KERRY. What do you think is the most responsible entity 

for that? 

Mr. REJESKI. I think it’s government-wide, but I think the coordi-
nation  again  has  to  come  from  the  top  level.  I  think  the  Govern-
ment needs to think about potentially bringing in an external enti-
ty that really knows how to do this. 

Let  me  conclude  with  sort  of  one  following  recommendation.  I 
think the greatest challenge we’re facing is basically how do we de-
velop  effective  governance  systems  for  21  Century  technology,  one 
that’s going to work with nanotech and all the technologies beyond, 
such as things like synthetic biology?

So I think it’s time to actually do a high-level commission, some-
thing  that  could  be  set  up  by  the  National  Academies  of  Science 
and  Public  Administration,  to  establish  them  and  actually  have 
them  undertake  this  larger  task  so  that  we  aren’t  sitting  here  in 
another  3  years  having  the  same  discussion  with  the  next  tech-
nology, and I think there’s simply too much at stake here. 

I’d  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for  giving  me  an  opportunity  to 

address you. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Rejeski follows:] 
PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID REJESKI, DIRECTOR, PROJECT ON EMERGING 

NANOTECHNOLOGIES, WOODROW WILSON INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR SCHOLARS 
I  would  like  to  thank  Chairman  Kerry,  Ranking  Member  Ensign,  and  the  Mem-
bers  of  the  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,  Science,  and  Transportation’s  Sub-
committee  on  Science,  Technology,  and  Innovation  for  holding  this  hearing  on  the 
‘‘National Nanotechnology Initiative: Charting the Course for Reauthorization.’’ 

My name is David Rejeski, and I direct the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies 
(PEN),  an  initiative  of  the  Woodrow  Wilson  International  Center  for  Scholars  and 
The Pew Charitable Trusts. It is dedicated to helping business, government, and the 
public anticipate and manage the possible health and environmental implications of 
nanotechnology.  As  part  of  the  Wilson  Center,  the  Project  is  a  non-partisan,  inde-
pendent  policy  research  organization  that  works  with  researchers,  government,  in-
dustry,  non-governmental  organizations  (NGO’s),  and  others  to  find  the  best  pos-
sible  solutions  to  developing  responsible,  beneficial,  and  acceptable  nanotech-
nologies.  The  opinions  expressed  in  this  testimony  are  my  own  and  do  not  nec-
essarily reflect views of the Wilson Center or The Pew Charitable Trusts. 

Our goal is to take a long-term look at nanotechnologies, to identify gaps in nano-
technology information, data, and oversight processes and to develop practical strat-
egies and approaches for closing those gaps and ensuring that the extraordinary po-
tential benefits of nanotechnologies will be realized. We aim to provide independent, 
objective information and analysis, which can help inform critical decisions affecting 
the  development,  use,  and  commercialization  of  nanotechnologies  across  the  globe. 
All  research  results,  reports,  and  the  outcomes  of  our  meetings  and  programs  are 
made  widely  available  through  publications  and  our  website:  http://www.nanotech 
project.org. 

In  short,  both  the  Wilson  Center  and  The  Pew  Charitable  Trusts  believe  there  is 
tremendous opportunity with nanotechnology to ‘‘get it right.’’ Societies have missed 
this chance with other new technologies and, by doing so, forfeited significant social, 
economic, and environmental benefits. 

When  I  last  appeared  before  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee  in  May  2006,  I  il-
lustrated the rapid commercialization of nanotechnology by providing analysis from 
the  Project’s  then  newly  released  inventory  of  nanotechnology  consumer  products. 
I  also  identified  a  number  of  key  challenges  and  factors  hindering  nanotechnology 
commercialization,  including  lack  of  public  engagement,  lack  of  effective  oversight 
and  governance  mechanisms,  and  lack  of  coordinated  risk  research  strategies. 
Today, I would like to address what has changed since that time, what has not, and 
what must change if nanotechnology commercialization is to be successful in the fu-
ture. 
What Has Changed 

I  would  like  to  begin  by  providing  an  update  on  the  state  of  commercialization 
of nano-based consumer products and then share some observations. These products 
are  important  because  consumer  products  will  be  most  of  the  public’s  first  experi-
ence with nanotechnology. 

• The  number  of  nano-enabled  consumer  products  has  increased  rapidly.  Two 
years  ago,  we  had  212  manufacturer-identified,  nano-enabled  consumer  prod-
ucts in our Consumer Products Inventory. The number now exceeds 600, a num-
ber  that  has  doubled  within  the  last  14  months  alone.1 Since  our  inventory  in-
cludes  only  manufacturer-identified  nanotechnology  products,  there  likely  are 
hundreds  of  more  products  on  the  market  that  are  not  identified  as  such.  This

number also does not take into account the hundreds of commercial and indus-
trial current uses of nanotechnology and nanomaterials. 

• Production  and  distribution  of  nanotechnology  products  is  increasingly  global. 
The  products  in  our  inventory  come  from  321  companies  in  20  countries.  All  of 
these  products  are  available  in  shopping  malls  or  over  the  Internet,  and  we 
have  purchased  many  of  them  on-line.  Thanks  to  business-to-business  (B2B) 
and  business-to-consumer  (B2C)  e-commerce,  nanotechnology  products  easily 
flow across international borders, raising control, trade, and oversight issues. 

• Silver  has  become  the  most  commonly  used  nano-engineered  material  in  con-
sumer  products.  The  type  of  nano-engineered  substances  in  these  products  has 
shifted  dramatically  from  materials  like  carbon  to  silver,  which  is  now  used  in 
over  140  products,  primarily  as  an  antimicrobial.  However,  with  production 
costs of carbon nanotubes dropping rapidly, this mix could shift again.2 

• The  number  of  children’s  products  is  on  the  rise.  Within  the  past  year,  an  in-
creasing  number  of  products  on  sale  are  targeted  at  children,  including:  pac-
ifiers,  toothbrushes,  baby  bottle  brushes,  and  stuffed  animals.  These  products 
originate  from  the  U.S.,  Australia,  China,  Germany,  and  Korea.  This  remains 
a  category  to  watch  as  nanotechnology’s  commercialization  proceeds,  especially 
since young children and babies generally have a greater vulnerability to chemi-
cals and other toxins. 

• Products are penetrating the market in areas where oversight regimes are weak. 
For  instance,  as  shown  in  Figure  1,  about  a  half  of  the  products  in  our  inven-
tory would fall under the purview of the Consumer Products Safety Commission 
(CPSC),  an  agency  which,  last  year,  according  to  CPSC  Commissioner  Thomas 
Moore,  spent  only  a  total  of  $20,000  to  do  a  literature  review  on  nanotechnol-
ogy.3 Other areas of high growth where oversight is weak include cosmetics and 
dietary  supplements,  both  areas  where  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration 
(FDA) has very limited regulatory authority.4 

2 ‘‘Over  the  past  2  years,  scale  up  of  multi-wall  carbon  nanotube  production  has  led  to  a  dra-
matic  price  decrease  down  to  $150/kg  for  semi-industrial  applications.  According  to  [NanoSEE 
2008: Nanomaterials Industrial Status and Expected Evolution], the run for industrial CNT pro-
duction plants has started in order to achieve a sustainable business with the commercialization 
of  these  high-tech  materials  with  a  mid-term  price  target  of  $45/kg.’’  ‘‘Nanotechnology  Industry

3 Testifying  before  a  Senate  Subcommittee  in  2007,  CPSC  Commissioner  Thomas  H.  Moore, 
who has served at the agency since 1995, summed up the situation: ‘‘I do not pretend to under-
stand nanotechnology and our agency does not pretend to have a grasp on this complicated sub-
ject either. For Fiscal Year 2007, we were only able to devote $20,000 in funds to do a literature 
review on nanotechnology.’’ Available at: http://www.cpsc.gov/pr/moore2007.pdf, accessed April

on  the  market  from  2005  to  2007  (in  red)  showing  products  under  possible  CPSC  jurisdiction 
(in blue). 

This suite of already-commercialized products tells us something about the emerg-
ing  face  of  the  nanotechnology  industry  and  the  challenges  we  face  as  we  begin  to 
introduce  nanotechnology  into  the  marketplace.  These  changes  are  signs  that  a  set 
of  issues  related  to  consumer  safety  and  health  are  emerging  that  were  not  as  ap-
parent when our inventory was first released. In addition, the current state of over-
sight  regimes  should  raise  serious  concerns  for  policymakers  tasked  with  the  chal-
lenge  of  spurring  nanotechnology  innovation  in  a  responsible  and  sustainable  man-
ner. 

It  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  willingness  of  the  public  to  ‘‘buy  nano’’ 
will  be  affected  by  changes  that  impact  the  overall  climate  in  the  commercial  mar-
ketplace and influence consumer trust and confidence. Let me explore some of these 
changes. 

Over  the  past  year,  American  consumers  have  painfully  learned  that  the  Federal 
oversight system is failing. The public has had to deal with lead in toys (a use that 
was  banned  30  years  ago  by  the  CPSC),  rat  poison  in  pet  food,  antifreeze  in  tooth-
paste,  and  E.  coli  in  meat.  Most  recently,  over  100  deaths  were  tied  directly  to  a 
compromised blood thinner.5 

These  were  equal  opportunity  failures  involving  multiple  government  agencies: 
the  FDA,  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA),  and  CPSC.  In  most  cases,  the 
agencies  were  not  dealing  with  exotic  toxins  but  ones  with  long  histories  of  per-
nicious effects. One logical question consumers will have is: ‘‘If the government can’t 
protect my children from lead, how will they deal with nanotechnology?’’ 

Not surprisingly, our latest polls on public awareness of nanotechnology show de-
clining  trust  in  the  government’s  ability  to  manage  risks  with  emerging  tech-
nologies.  National  surveys  conducted  on  behalf  of  the  Project  by  Peter  D.  Hart  Re-
search  Associates  in  August  2006  and  August  2007  indicate  declining  levels  of  con-
fidence  in  the  USDA  and  FDA,  as  well  as  businesses  and  companies,  to  maximize 
the  benefits  and  minimize  the  risks  of  scientific  and  technological  advancements 
(Figure  2).  Considering  the  events  of  the  past  year,  it  would  not  be  surprising  to 
see an even greater drop in the levels of confidence in government regulatory agen-
cies when we repeat our national survey this summer. 

Public trust is the ‘‘dark horse’’ in nanotechnology’s future. If government and in-
dustry  do  not  work  to  build  public  confidence  in  nanotechnology,  consumers  may 
reach  for  the  ‘‘No-Nano’’  label  in  the  future.  Public  perceptions  can  have  large  eco-

nomic impacts. The European Union’s (EU) de facto moratorium on the approval of 
new genetically modified food products, driven largely by public concerns, is costing 
American farmers an estimated $300 million per year in lost sales.6 

Figure  2.  Percentage  of  respondents  with  ‘‘Great  deal/fair  amount  of  confidence’’  in  each  to 
maximize benefits and minimize risks of scientific/technological advancements. Results are from 
surveys  conducted  in  August  2006  and  August  2007.  Each  survey  had  1,014  respondents  and 
margin of error of ±3.1 percentage points. 

Consumer  confidence  will  be  further  undermined  if  companies  continue  to  make 
claims  about  nanotechnology  in  their  products  that  cannot  be  supported.  Last 
month,  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  fined  a  California  company 
$208,000  for  making  unsubstantiated  claims  involving  the  anti-bacterial  benefits  of 
a  nano-silver  coating  for  computer  mice  and  keyboards.  Since  that  time,  the  claim 
about the use of nanomaterials has been removed from the manufacturer’s website, 
though  the  product  appears  to  have  remained  unchanged.  This  phenomenon  is  one 
that  has  been  seen  with  other  products,  including  food  storage  containers  and 
stuffed animals. 

In  addition  to  disappearing  product  labels,  the  nanotechnology  commercial  land-
scape  is  awash  with  hyperbolic  product  claims  so  obtuse  that  no  consumer  could 
possibly  unravel  their  meaning.  Companies  are  creating  a  literal  nanotechnology 
‘‘Tower of Babel.’’ Here are a few examples from our Consumer Products Inventory: 
NanO Bio-Sim 

‘‘This  product  is  essential  for  one’s  optimum  health.  The  elimination  of  Candida, 
parasites, worms, yeast, fungi, and amoebas from the body is the fundamental base 
of  any  cure  that  will  return  health  to  the  body  . . .  Once  Bio-Sim  is  absorbed  by 
the  body,  the  sugar  and  the  vinegar  begin  attracting  the  parasites,  fungi,  Candida, 
worms, and amoebas from their hiding places. Then, the NanO silica act as cutting 
knives  on  the  intruders.  Fortunately,  this  action  only  affects  the  pathogens  and 
leaves  the  healthy  body  intact  because  of  the  perfect  sizing  of  the  diatomaceous 
earth.’’ 7

Discussions  about  nanotechnology  should  not  be  just  about  the  risks,  but  also 
about  benefits.  Most  nano-enabled  products  carry  a  price  premium  over  their  non- 
nano  counterparts.  What,  exactly,  are  consumers  getting  for  their  money,  and  who 
can help sort this out? 

The  developments  I  have  outlined  do  not  bode  well  for  nanotechnology  commer-
cialization. American consumers are nervous—so are other people who matter to the 
long-term  success  of  nanotechnology,  including  insurers  and  investors,  state  and 
local  governments,  NGO’s,  other  countries,  and  nanotechnology  companies.  Let  me 
summarize some of these concerns. 

Insurers  and  Investors:  The  financial  community  is  taking  another  look  at  nano-
technology.  The  Lloyd’s  of  London  Emerging  Risks  Team  just  issued  a  report  on 
nanotechnology that noted that ‘‘due to the potential impact to the insurance indus-
try  if  something  were  to  go  wrong,  nanotechnology  features  very  highly  in  Lloyd’s 
top emerging risks.’’ 10 When I talked recently to staff at Lloyd’s, they said that two 
things  are  critical  to  the  insurance  sector  in  terms  of  reducing  risks:  transparency 
and  regulation.  We  have  neither  at  the  moment  and  the  Federal  Government  is 
doing little to remedy this problem. Similar to Lloyd’s, Zurich Insurance’s Canadian 
office ranked nanotechnology in the top tier of emerging global risks (along with cli-
mate  change  and  deteriorating  infrastructure).11 A  recent  UK  exercise  involving  35

representatives from government, NGO’s, and academia also identified nanotechnol-
ogy  as  the  top  risk  to  ecosystems  (above  climate  change  and  the  possible  impact  of 
novel pathogens).12 

One  reason  insurers  and  investors  are  nervous  is  the  fear  that  some  companies 
are not being transparent. Last week, the Investor Environmental Health Network, 
in collaboration with investment managers, who have more than $41 billion in com-
bined  assets,  released  a  report  raising  concerns  that  companies  are  not  apprising 
investors  of  potential  nanotechnology  risks.  The  report  notes  that,  ‘‘. . .  companies 
dealing  with  nanomaterials  . . .  are  not  disclosing  the  evidence  of  health  risks  of 
nanotechnology  products,  nor  the  lack  of  adequate  product  testing  prior  to  their 
sales.’’ 13 

State  and  Local  Governments:  Tired  of  waiting  for  Federal  action,  municipal  gov-
ernments are moving to provide specific guidance to nanotechnology firms in places 
like  Berkeley,  CA,  and,  soon,  in  Cambridge,  MA.  Interestingly,  when  Cambridge 
passed the world’s first biotechnology ordinance in the mid-1970s, companies did not 
flee.  The  city  provided  a  unique  location  where  the  rules  of  the  road  were  known 
and the public was comfortable with established safety precautions. It is now home 
to  55  biotechnology  firms.14 Last  year,  the  state  of  Massachusetts  established  an 
Interagency  Nanotech  Council  to  discuss  nanotechnology  issues 15 and,  most  re-
cently, a state lawmaker in Wisconsin has sought answers from state officials about 
potential reporting requirements for firms involved with nanotechnology. Also, a re-
cent  analysis  by  our  Project  indicates  that  five  states  with  significant  nanotechnol-
ogy activities (CA, MA, NY, NJ, MI) could take a more proactive approach to nano-
technology  oversight  based  on  legal  authorities  that  go  beyond  those  of  the  Federal 
Government.16 This is not an optimal solution (since it could disaggregate markets), 
but history has shown that state action is often a prerequisite for Federal movement 
on  emerging  environmental  and  public  health  issues.  As  Justice  Brandeis  once 
noted,  the  states  are  the  ‘‘laboratories  of  democracy,’’  and  they  often  drive  public 
policy innovation. 

NGO’s:  During  the  last  year,  the  positions  taken  by  NGO’s  have  hardened.  A  re-
cent  report  by  Friends  of  the  Earth  called  for  a  complete  moratorium  on  the  use 
of  nanotechnology  in  all  foods  and  food  packaging  until  more  is  known  about  the 
risks to humans and the environment.17 In early April, the Silicon Valley Toxics Co-
alition called for ‘‘new comprehensive state and Federal regulatory policies that ade-
quately  address  the  potential  hazards  posed  by  nanotechnology.’’ 18 Increasingly, 
NGO’s  are  growing  impatient  with  a  lack  of  transparency  by  government  and  slow 
action  on  oversight.  If  there  ever  was  a  honeymoon  with  the  NGO  community,  it 
is over. 

Other  Countries:  Countries  are  responding  to  this  evolving  commercialization  cli-
mate  differently,  which  generates  its  own  set  of  issues.  Internationally,  the  EU  is 
clearly moving in the direction of a more precautionary approach to nanotechnology 
oversight  raising  the  potential  of  a  three-tiered  governance  system  at  a  global 
level—reflecting  diverging  approaches  by  the  EU,  the  U.  S.,  and  countries  like 
China. Large disparities in nanotechnology oversight systems at a global level would 
be  highly  counterproductive  and  create  an  uneven  playing  field  for  U.S.  companies 
who  want  to  operate  in  the  global  marketplace.  Variations  in  oversight  also  open 
the  door  to  potentially  dangerous  products  flowing  across  our  borders,  as  we  have 
seen in the case of substandard products from China.

Firms: Increasingly, nanotechnology firms, especially small firms, are nervous be-
cause  government  has  failed  to  provide  a  clear  and  predictable  path  to  compliance. 
A new report by Ernst & Young on strategic business risks identified regulatory and 
compliance  risk  as  the  number  one  risk  companies  face  today  and  will  likely  face 
in the future.19 Recently, our Project released the results of a New England focused 
survey, conducted by researchers at University of Massachusetts-Lowell, that inves-
tigated  how  nanotechnology  firms  (especially  small-  and  medium-size  firms)  are 
dealing  with  environmental,  health  and  safety  (EHS)  management  and  what  infor-
mation they need to address risks proactively.20 The survey produced two key find-
ings. The first is that most nanotechnology firms recognize the existence of potential 
risks.  The  second,  however,  is  that  the  firms  (especially  small  firms)  feel  that  they 
lack:  (a)  information  on  the  health  and  environmental  risks  of  nanomaterials  and 
(b) the necessary guidance from suppliers, industry, governmental regulatory bodies, 
and  others  to  manage  risks  associated  with  these  materials  and  processes.  As  one 
senior  safety  manager  in  a  Massachusetts  corporation  said,  ‘‘At  this  time,  we  don’t 
understand  what  regulatory  requirements  may  be  uniquely  applicable  to  nanotech-
nology  and  nanoparticles.’’  Compliance  is  hard  if  the  compliance  criteria  are  un-
known. 

Interestingly,  the  one  entity  that  thinks  things  are  fine  is  our  Federal  Govern-
ment—specifically,  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  (NNI)—which  has  pro-
vided  continued  public  reassurances  that  risk  research  is  more  than  sufficient  and 
existing oversight systems adequate for nanotech. As Congress approaches the reau-
thorization  of  the  21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act, 
they need to carefully weigh the evidence for and against the Federal Government’s 
position and the ultimate cost of a miscalculation. 
What Has Not Changed and What Needs to Change 

Let  me  now  talk  about  what  has  not  changed  over  the  past  2  years  and  what 
needs  to  be  remedied  as  the  Congress  turns  its  attention  to  the  reauthorization  of 
the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act and looks beyond. 
Three  issues  must  be  addressed  by  the  Act:  transparency,  strategy,  and  engage-
ment. 

1.  Transparency:  The  Reauthorization  Bill  must  make  the  NNI  fully  transparent 
and  accountable  in  terms  of  its  investments  and  strategy  to  address  the  risks  of 
nanotechnologies. 

During  a  three-year  period,  our  Project  has  spent  between  $50,000  and  $60,000 
in  staff  time  analyzing  and  making  public  Federal  Government  expenditures  that 
address  nano-related  risks  to  workers,  consumers,  and  the  environment.  It  has  not 
been an easy task, but, more importantly, it should never have been necessary. The 
Federal  Government’s  data  on  risk  research,  including  spending  levels,  detailed 
project descriptions, and all assumptions driving the analysis, should have been on- 
line and transparent from the very beginning of the NNI. 

Unfortunately,  the  recent  study  by  the  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO) 
has  failed  to  remedy  this  problem  since  the  detailed  data  that  the  GAO  collected 
for  their  analysis  is  also  not  being  made  publicly  available.21 The  existing  lack  of 
transparency undermines public trust, undercuts our ability to build workable pub-
lic-private  partnerships,  raises  suspicions  among  NGO’s,  and  weakens  the  basis  for 
international  collaboration  on  risk  research.  It  also  makes  any  form  of  account-
ability  to  the  Congress,  for  instance,  virtually  impossible.  Finally,  a  strong  risk 
strategy cannot be built on a weak quantitative foundation that cannot be validated 
by  external  stakeholders.  Secrecy  about  the  data  underlying  the  government’s  ap-
proach to risk compromises our national investments in nanotechnology. As the late 
Senator Patrick Moynihan was fond of saying: ‘‘Secrecy is for losers.’’ 22 

Our  analyses  consistently  show  that  the  Federal  Government  is  inflating  invest-
ments  in  risk  analysis  and  management  by  orders  of  magnitude  and,  by  doing  so, 
distorting  the  perceptual  environment  where  nanotechnology  investment  and  com-

has high relevance to any industry using nanotechnology. Source: Ernst & Young (in collabora-

mercialization  takes  place.  These  assurances  of  large  investments  in  risk  research 
(combined with statements of adequate oversight) provide a false sense of confidence 
and actually shift risks onto consumers, workers, investors, and, ultimately, onto in-
surers and re-insurers. 

The  Act  must  require  that  a  comprehensive,  public,  on-line  EHS  research  data-
base  be  created  and  also  mandate  annual  updates.  This  should  be  done  within  6 
months following the passage of the Act. Collaboration with international organiza-
tions,  such  as  the  OECD,  should  be  supported  to  expand  the  collection  and  on-line 
publication  of  EHS  research  data  internationally.  Finally,  the  collection,  analysis, 
and  publication  of  other  data  key  to  understanding  nanotechnology  commercializa-
tion should be undertaken by the Department of Commerce, such as data on indus-
try  structure,  venture  capital  investments,  job  creation,  and  domestic  and  inter-
national market growth. 

Increased  transparency  must  be  combined  with  increased  oversight.  The  existing 
reviews of the NNI through the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Tech-
nology  (PCAST)  are  inadequate.  PCAST  is  already  stretched  too  thin  and  lacks  the 
depth and breadth of knowledge necessary to review the critical EHS component of 
the NNI along with other areas crucial to the successful commercialization of nano-
technology. 

Given  the  size  of  our  investments  in  the  NNI  and  its  implications  for  economic 
growth,  a  separate  external  advisory  board  (independent  of  PCAST)  should  be  cre-
ated  that  has  broad  representation  from  the  nanotechnology  community,  including 
universities,  NGO’s,  investors,  and  a  range  of  businesses,  especially  small  busi-
nesses, which often lack a voice in our policy deliberations. Finally, the NNI should 
fully  support  the  external  review  of  the  EH&S  risk  research  strategy  by  the  Na-
tional Academies’ Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology (BEST). This re-
view has received broad support from a variety of stakeholders including the Amer-
ican Chemistry Council, Dupont, Evonik (formerly Degussa), the NanoBusiness Alli-
ance, and the Environmental Defense Fund. Given the existing lack of transparency 
regarding  the  government’s  risk  related  research,  reviews  by  independent  entities 
are critical to maintaining accountability. 

2.  Strategy:  After  4  years  of  waiting,  the  Congress  has  still  not  received  a  com-
prehensive,  top-down  strategy  to  address  existing  and  emerging  nanotechnology 
risks. 

Though  the  NNI  strategy  for  addressing  risks  has  improved,  it  still  lacks  a  clear 
set of government-wide priorities tied directly to funding levels, which would ensure 
that  the  right  agencies  are  focused  on  the  right  risks  at  the  right  time  in  the  re-
search  and  development  and  commercialization  cycle.  The  recent  GAO  report 
praised the level of collaboration between agencies involved in the NNI, but collabo-
ration between agencies is an insufficient condition for success. Like soccer, moving 
the ball down the field as a team does not necessarily result in a goal—for that you 
need  strategy  and  leadership.  In  short,  what  the  NNI  currently  calls  a  strategy  is 
really  a  collection  of  what  individual  agencies  ‘‘can’’  do  and  not  what  they  ‘‘should’’ 
do. 

Any risk strategy also needs appropriate funding to work. I support a 10 percent 
floor  for  EHS  funding  because  PEN’s  extensive  analyses  indicate  that  funding  for 
highly-relevant risk research has been exaggerated for at least the past 3 years, and 
this underinvestment needs to be corrected, especially as more nanotechnology prod-
ucts  flow  into  the  marketplace  and  raise  questions  about  public  safety  and  chal-
lenges for government regulators. A PEN analysis of current research projects listed 
in  the  NNI’s  ‘‘Strategy  for  Nanotechnology-Related  Environmental,  Health,  and 
Safety  Research’’  found  that  only  62  of  the  246  projects  listed  were  highly  relevant 
to addressing EHS risks of nanotechnology.23 These 62 projects accounted for an es-
timated  $13  million  in  research  and  development  funding  for  2006—far  lower  than 
the $68 million cited by the NNI document as being focused on EHS research.24 In 

23 Project  specific  data  underpinning  this  analysis  can  be  found  in  the  Project  on  Emerging 
Nanotechnologies Environment, Health and Safety Research Inventory. This inventory is in the 
process of being adopted and updated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel-
opment,  Working  Party  on  Manufactured  Nanomaterials.  Available  at:  http://www.nano 
techproject.org/inventories/ehs/, accessed April 15, 2008. 

24 Further  independent  assessment  of  research  funded  in  2006  reveals  funding  for  highly-rel-
evant  risk  research  was  closer  to  $20  million.  The  discrepancy  appears  to  be  due  to  relevant 
research  that  that  the  NNI  missed  in  their  analysis—another  indicator  that  the  government  is 
not  on  top  of  what  research  is  being  funded,  and  lacks  sufficient  transparency  for  effective  ac-
countability.  Available  at:  http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/ehs/,  accessed  April  8,

fact, our analysis now shows that the EU is spending almost twice the U.S. invest-
ment in highly-relevant EHS risk research.25 

Research  programs  like  the  NNI  do  not  automatically  guarantee  an  optimal  allo-
cation  of  public  money.  Sometimes,  key  constituents  or  topics  are  left  unfunded  or 
under  addressed.  Recognizing  this  problem,  the  government  has  set  minimal  fund-
ing  requirements.  The  Federal  Government  does  this  with  small  businesses  in  our 
set-asides for Small Business Innovation Research grants and with the Human Ge-
nome  Project  by  dedicating  5  percent  of  all  Project  research  spending  to  examine 
ethical, legal, and social implications that the policy community knew would accom-
pany  the  development  and  application  of  genomics.  The  reauthorization  proposal  to 
set  aside  10  percent  of  the  total  NNI  budget  for  nanotechnology  EHS  research  has 
received support from a wide range of stakeholders including the NanoBusiness Alli-
ance,  American  Chemistry  Council,  and  NGO’s,  including  the  Environmental  De-
fense  Fund.  As  Sean  Murdock,  director  of  the  NanoBusiness  Alliance,  said  in  his 
recent testimony before the House Science and Technology Committee, ‘‘. . . we be-
lieve  that  10  percent  of  the  total  funding  for  nanotechnology  research  and  develop-
ment  is  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  resources  that  will  be  required  to  execute  the 
strategic plan . . .’’ 26 

The strategy must also increase, by orders of magnitude, the funding available for 
risk  research  at  agencies  with  oversight  missions  such  as  the  EPA,  FDA,  USDA, 
and CPSC. Our analysis has found that only $4.5 million for 36 projects at the EPA, 
$5.1  million  for  45  projects  at  the  National  Institute  for  Occupational  Safety  and 
Health, and $56,501 for 9 projects at the USDA is dedicated to projects focusing on 
the risks of nanotechnology for FY2006. 

Government  oversight  based  on  weak  science  is  not  acceptable.  In  some  of  these 
agencies,  there  may  also  be  a  lack  of  human  resources  and  the  scientific  expertise 
needed  to  assess  nanotechnology  risks.  Consequently,  the  Federal  risk  research 
strategy must involve a human resources component, including an analysis of exper-
tise  gaps  and  plans  on  how  they  will  be  funded  and  filled.  The  recent  assessment 
of  the  FDA’s  scientific  capacity  by  their  own  science  board  uncovered  a  number  of 
limitations that are directly relevant to nanotechnology: 

quately regulated by the FDA. 

• The  development  of  medical  products  based  on  ‘‘new  science’’  cannot  be  ade-
• There is insufficient capacity in modeling, risk assessment, and analysis. 
• The FDA science agenda lacks a coherent structure and vision, as well as effec-

tive coordination and prioritization.27 

The  strategy  should  support  specific  mechanisms  to  facilitate  public-private  part-
nerships  focused  on  closing  knowledge  gaps  in  nanotechnology  risk  assessment  and 
management  and  leveraging  scarce  funds  across  sectors.  The  NNI  should  evaluate 
a number of models for public-private partnerships using the following criteria: 

be fully open to public scrutiny. 

• Independence. The selection, direction, and evaluation of funded research would 
have  to  be  science-based  and  fully  independent  of  the  business  and  views  of 
partners in the organization.

Two models should be adapted, funded, and evaluated over the next 3 years. 
Finally, there is still not enough attention being paid to engineering the risks out 
of  nanotechnology  manufacturing  and  products.  Recent  research  at  the  Massachu-
setts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT)  has  shown  that  carbon  nanotubes  may  contain 
high  concentrations  of  toxic  impurities  like  chromium  and  lead—if  we  continue 
down  this  path,  the  nanotechnology  revolution  risks  being  a  dirty  one,  not  a  green 
one.  We  have  the  ability  to  enable  ‘‘green’’  nanotechnology  production  and  prod-
ucts—reducing  toxic  inputs,  energy  use,  emissions,  end-oflife  impacts,  and  ulti-
mately  financial  liabilities—but  presently  we  lack  a  coherent  strategy  and  the  re-
sources  to  do  this.  University  of  Oregon  researcher  Jim  Hutchinson  has  been  able 
to  create  gold  nanomaterials  through  ‘‘green’’  synthesis  that  is  not  only  safer  and 
faster  than  traditional  means  but  also  much  less  expensive.29 The  longer  the  gov-
ernment  and  industry  delay  investments  in  ‘‘greening’’  the  nanotechnology  produc-
tion infrastructure, the more we may have to invest to manage risks after the fact. 
Based  on  PEN  analysis,  I  recommend  dedicating  $20–30  million  annually  to  estab-
lish  at  least  one  major  university  center  on  ‘‘green’’  nanotechnologies  and  a  pres-
tigious  and  highly-visible  award  to  spur  green  nanotechnology  innovation.30 The 
goal should be to make the U.S. the world’s leader in ‘‘green’’ nanotechnology. 

3.  Engagement:  Public  awareness  of  nanotechnology  is  stuck  at  a  low  level.  The 
same  surveys  mentioned  earlier  have  actually  shown  a  decrease  in  the  number  of 
Americans  who  have  ‘‘heard  a  lot’’  about  nanotechnology  from  August  2006  to  Au-
gust  2007.  Despite  an  annual  U.S.  public  and  private  sector  investment  of  over  $4 
billion  in  nanotechnology  research  and  development,  80–90  percent  of  Americans 
have  heard  ‘‘very  little’’  or  ‘‘nothing’’  about  nanotechnology.  The  original  21st  Cen-
tury  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  specified  that  the  government 
provide: 

‘‘. . .  through  the  National  Nanotechnology  Coordination  Office  . . .  for  public 
input  and  outreach  to  be  integrated  into  the  Program  by  the  convening  of  reg-
ular and ongoing public discussions, through mechanisms such as citizens’ pan-
els, consensus conferences, and educational events, as appropriate; . . .’’ 

Unfortunately,  this  mandate  came  with  no  funding,  and  the  National  Nanotech-

nology Coordination Office has not fulfilled this mission. 

At  this  critical  juncture,  the  Federal  Government  has  no  strategy  to  engage  the 
public  and  fill  the  knowledge  gap  about  nanotechnology,  which  could  have  serious 
implications  for  nanotechnology’s  long-term  success.  Significant  resources  and  inge-
nuity need to be committed to this area. An essential element missing from previous 
efforts  has  been  genuine  citizen  engagement.  We  are  still  talking  to  the  American 
public  about  nanotechnology  through  TV  shows,  websites,  and  museum  exhibits— 
this  is  not  public  engagement.  Some  experiments  on  engagement  have  been  run  by 
various National Science Foundation-funded nanotechnology centers, but there is no 
effort  being  made  to  scale  these  up  to  reach  significant  numbers  of  people  nation-
wide (we need to engage thousands, not dozens). 

As  the  commercialization  of  nano-based  products  accelerates,  how  the  public 
learns about nanotechnology, from whom, and with what message will be critical to 
assuring  public  confidence  in  the  applications  and  support  for  further  government 
funding.  We  need  large-scale  education  and  citizen  deliberation  on  how  to  balance 
the  opportunities  and  risks  presented  by  nanotechnology  that  engages  the  diverse 
perspectives  of  the  American  public,  helps  identify  a  collective  public  agenda,  gen-
erates  buy-in  from  stakeholders,  and  raises  awareness  about  the  issues.  For  nano-
technology  to  succeed,  the  strategy  for  public  engagement  will  be  as  critical  as  the 
strategy  for  risk  assessment  and  management  and  will  require  adequate  funding 
and  top-level  attention.  It  cannot  be  approached  piecemeal  or  as  an  afterthought. 
The NNI should bring in an outside entity with proven capabilities in running large 
multi-stakeholder  dialogues  on  key  national  policy  issues  and  provide  adequate 
funding to run a one-year, national dialogue on nanotechnology. 
Conclusions 

Let  me  close  by  putting  forth  a  greater  challenge  to  the  Committee  and  our  gov-
ernment.  For  the  commercial  success  of  any  emerging  technology,  we  need  a  better

approach  to  governance  that  can  support  strategic  risk  research,  provide  adequate 
oversight, and engage the broader public in our technological future. With nanotech-
nology,  industry  and  government  are  struggling  to  balance  science,  innovation,  and 
the  pressures  for  rapid  commercialization  with  a  need  to  address  risks  and  public 
concerns  early  and  proactively.  This  situation  does  not  surprise  people  who  were 
part  of  the  debates  around  agricultural  biotechnology  in  the  1990s  or  watched  the 
tortuous path of nuclear power through the 1950s and 60s. The recurrence of issues 
around  risk  assessment,  oversight,  and  public  dialogue—irrespective  of  the  tech-
nology  involved—indicates  that  these  challenges  have  deeper  origins  that  will  not 
respond  to  quick  fixes.  The  government  is  not  organized  for  the  tasks  at  hand,  and 
the  challenges  we  face  will  only  grow  more  complex  as  nanotechnology  and  bio-
technology increasingly converge and new scientific fields, such as synthetic biology, 
emerge. 

We  need  to  bring  together  the  best  minds  in  the  Nation  to  develop  a  governance 
system  for  21st  century  technologies,  a  system  that  will  work  with  nanotechnology 
and  the  technologies  beyond.  A  high-level  commission  (organized  by  the  national 
academies of Science and Public Administration) should be established to undertake 
this task. 

Finally,  let  me  say  that  I  applaud  the  Committee  for  focusing  our  attention  on 
issues affecting the successful commercialization of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology 
is  no  longer  just  a  large  government  research  project.  Products  are  moving  out  of 
the lab into the market and onto store shelves. This is success, but it is not guaran-
teed  forever.  The  next  two  to  3  years  will  be  critical  to  ensuring  that  our  invest-
ments  pay  off,  and  the  structure  and  functions  of  the  NNI  will  play  an  important 
role  in  making  sure  we  can  maximize  the  benefits  of  nanotechnology  while  mini-
mizing the risks. 

APPENDIX 

Comparison of Nanotechnology Risk-Research Funding for 2006 

Definitions of risk-relevant research used in funding assessments: 
NNI 

In  the  context  of  this  comparison,  the  given  NNI  definition  of  EHS-relevant  re-
search  is  ‘‘research  whose  primary  purpose  is  to  understand  and  address  potential 
risks to health and the environment posed by this technology.’’ 31 
GAO 

From  the  GAO  assessment  of  EHS-relevant  research,  it  appears  that  the  same 
definition  of  relevance  was  used  as  established  by  the  NNI  (see  above).  From  the 
GAO report: 

‘‘To  assess  whether  or  not  the  primary  purpose  of  the  research  conducted  by 
these  agencies  addressed  the  EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology,  we  reviewed  quali-
tative data on all projects funded by EPA, NIH, NIOSH, NIST, and NSF in Fis-
cal  Year  2006.  To  minimize  bias  and  to  ensure  the  consistency  of  our  evalua-
tion, the team independently conducted project reviews by using publicly avail-
able and agency documentation, such as project abstracts or grant applications, 
to  make  our  determinations.  For  categorization  of  projects  that  appeared  ques-
tionable  to  us,  we  discussed  the  categorization  with  agency  officials  and  modi-
fied  our  determination  as  appropriate  given  the  additional  support  provided  by 
the agency.’’ 32 

PEN 

PEN defines highly relevant research as: 

‘‘Research  that  is  specifically  and  explicitly  focused  on  the  health,  environ-
mental  and/or  safety  implications  of  nanotechnology.  Also  included  in  this  cat-
egory are projects and programs where the majority of the research undertaken

STATEMENT OF P. LEE FERGUSON, PH.D., ASSISTANT 

PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AND 

BIOCHEMISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA 

Dr.  FERGUSON.  Good  afternoon.  I  wish  to  thank  you,  Senator 
Kerry and the other members of the Subcommittee, for inviting me 
to testify today. 

I’m  Lee  Ferguson,  an  Assistant  Professor  at  the  University  of 

South Carolina. 

Since  2003,  I  have  led  a  team  of  researchers  investigating  the 
fate and effects of nanomaterials in the environment. I feel strongly 
about  the  need  to  continue  and  to  expand  this  research  and  I’m 
happy to talk with you today about it. 

My  primary  point  is  that  development  and  commercialization  of 
nanotechnology  may  present  unforeseen  hazards  to  environmental 
and human health. It is therefore essential that scientific research 
be continued to address this issue. 

Since  the  initial  authorization  of  the  National  Nanotechnology 
Initiative,  the  Federal  Government  has  supported  scientific  re-
search  into  the  environmental  and  health  impacts  of  nanotechnol-
ogy. There now exists a growing body of work addressing the risks 
associated  with  nanomaterials.  However,  it  is  clear  that  we  have 
much to learn. 

The  current  state  of  the  science  with  respect  to  environmental 
health  and  safety  issues  of  nanotechnology  can  be  summarized 
briefly.  We  have  learned  that  nanomaterials  are  very  difficult  to 
measure accurately in environmental and biological systems. It has 
become  clear  that  existing  analytical  methods  are  simply  inappro-
priate or insufficient to make these measurements. 

We’ve also learned that nanomaterials may be transported in the 
environment  in  ways  that  are  not  necessarily  predictable  from  ex-
isting  scientific  models  and  that  nanomaterials  may  interact  di-
rectly  with  pollutants  of  concern,  such  as  PCBs  and  heavy  metals. 
Finally, there are indications of risks associated with exposure of 
humans  and  ecosystems  to  nanomaterials.  These  risks  include  di-
rect toxicity and uptake of nanomaterials into biological tissues. 

Through  the  NNI,  the  Federal  Government  has  developed  a 
strategy  aimed  at  prioritizing  research  needs  with  respect  to  envi-
ronmental  health  and  safety  issues  of  nanotechnology.  This 
prioritization  is  essential  so  that  an  organized  effort  can  be  made 
to address environmental and health impacts of nanotechnology as 
this  technology  is  developed.  This  last  point  is  critical.  We  cannot 
afford  to  wait  until  nanotechnology  is  fully  developed  to  begin  as-
sessing  its  risks  and  hazards  to  human  health  and  the  environ-
ment. 

I  wish  to  highlight  specific  areas  of  research  that  I  believe  de-
serve particular attention. Without methods for detecting and char-
acterizing nanomaterials in the environment and in human tissues, 
nanomaterial exposure assessment is impossible. 

Research into analytical methods and metrology of nanomaterials 
is  a  top  priority  and  support  for  this  work  should  be  accelerated 
within the NNI. 

With respect to research on environmental and human health ef-
fects  of  nanomaterials,  I  stress  the  need  to  develop  standardized 
testing  methods  that  are  appropriate  to  assessing  toxicity  and  bio-

logical  uptake  of  nanomaterials  and  their  manufacturing  byprod-
ucts. 

There’s  a  critical  need  to  assess  the  human  and  ecological  expo-
sure  after  release  of  nanomaterials  into  the  ambient  environment. 
We  still  have  very  limited  knowledge  of  the  treatability  of  nano-
technology  waste  as  well  as  the  routes  by  which  nanomaterials 
may enter and move within our air and water. 

Finally,  our  ability  to  assess  and  predict  risk  of  emerging  nano-
technologies  to  human  and  environmental  health  depends  on  un-
derstanding  the  mechanisms  by  which  nanomaterials  act  on  bio-
logical  systems.  This  understanding  represents  a  grand  scientific 
challenge and will require a will require a significant and well-sup-
ported effort. 

During  reauthorization  of  the  NNI,  I  ask  you  to  consider  the  re-
sources that are needed now and in the future for addressing these 
concerns.  As  you’ve  heard,  between  2005  and  2009,  expenditures 
within the NNI on EHS research have increased from 3 percent to 
approximately 5 percent of the total NNI budget. 

A significant increase in our scientific understanding of the envi-
ronmental  and  health  impacts  of  nanotechnology  will  require  a 
more  substantial  investment.  A  realistic  target  in  the  very  near 
term  should  be  to  increase  the  level  of  funding  for  EHS  research 
on nanotechnology to exceed 10 percent of the NNI budget. 

I wish to close by saying that we have a unique opportunity now. 
Through  the  NNI,  we  have  begun  to  address  the  EHS  risks  of 
nanotechnology  simultaneously  with  the  development  of  this  tech-
nology. We have only to look at the lessons learned from PCBs and 
other  legacy  chemical  contaminants  to  realize  the  dangers  of  wait-
ing  until  new  technologies  mature  to  assess  their  environmental 
and health risks. 

I  urge  this  Committee  to  consider  these  concerns  during  the  re-

authorization of NNI. 

Thank you for considering my testimony.

Oral Testimony 

Good afternoon. I wish to thank Senator Kerry and the other members of the Sub-

What  we  know:  The  current  state  of  the  science  with  respect  to  environmental, 

health, and safety issues of nanotechnology can be summarized briefly. 

1 For  example,  since  2003  the  U.S.  EPA  National  Center  for  Environmental  Research  has  co-
ordinated  extramural  funding  efforts  among  EPA,  NSF,  DOE,  NIOSH,  and  NIEHS  to  address 
environmental and health effects of nanomaterials (http://es.epa.gov/ncer/nano/index.html).

• We  also  have  learned  that  nanomaterials  may  be  transported  in  the  environ-

Federal  prioritization:  Through  the  NNI,  the  Federal  Government  has  developed 
a  roadmap  aimed  at  prioritizing  research  needs  with  respect  to  environmental, 
health, and safety issues of nanotechnology.2 This prioritization is essential so that

Future research needs: I wish to highlight specific areas of research that I believe 

deserve particular attention: 

• Without methods for detecting and characterizing nanomaterials in the environ-
ment  and  in  human  tissues,  nanomaterial  exposure  assessment  is  impossible. 
Research  into  analytical  methods  and  metrology  of  nanomaterials  is  a  top  pri-
ority and support for this work should be accelerated within the NNI. 
• With  respect  to  research  on  environmental  and  human  health  effects  of  nano-
materials,  I  stress  the  need  to  develop  standardized  testing  methods  that  are 
appropriate  to  assessing  toxicity  and  biological  uptake  of  nanomaterials  and 
their manufacturing byproducts. 
• There is a critical need to assess routes of human and ecological exposure after 
release of nanomaterials into the ambient environment. We still have very lim-
ited  knowledge  of  the  treatability  of  nanotechnology  wastes  as  well  as  the 
routes  by  which  nanomaterials  may  enter  and  move  within  our  air  and  water. 
• Finally,  our  ability  to  assess  and  predict  risk  of  emerging  nanotechnologies  to 
human  and  environmental  health  depends  on  understanding  the  mechanisms 
by  which  nanomaterials  act  on  biological  systems.  This  understanding  rep-
resents  a  grand  scientific  challenge  and  will  require  significant  and  well-sup-
ported effort. 

During  reauthorization  of  the  NNI,  I  ask  you  to  consider  the  resources  that  are 
needed  now  and  in  the  future  for  addressing  these  concerns.  Between  2005  and 
2009, expenditures within the NNI on EHS research have increased from 3 percent 
to  approximately  5  percent  of  the  total  NNI  budget.  A  significant  increase  in  our 
scientific understanding of the environmental and health impacts of nanotechnology 
will require a more substantial investment. A realistic target in the very near term 
should  be  to  increase  the  level  of  funding  for  EHS  research  on  nanotechnology  to 
exceed 10 percent of the NNI budget. 

I  wish  to  close  by  saying  that  we  have  a  unique  opportunity  now—through  the 
NNI  we  have  begun  to  address  the  EHS  risks  of  nanotechnology  simultaneously 
with the development of this technology. We have only to look at the lessons learned 
from PCBs and other legacy chemical contaminants to realize the dangers of waiting 
until  new  technologies  are  mature  to  assess  their  environmental  and  health  risks. 
I  urge  this  Committee  to  consider  these  concerns  during  the  reauthorization  of  the 
NNI. Thank you for considering my testimony.

Written Statement 

65 

I  wish  to  thank  Senator  Kerry  and  the  other  members  of  the  Subcommittee  for 
inviting me to testify about the current status and future needs of research into the 
environmental,  health,  and  safety  issues  of  nanotechnology.  I  am  Lee  Ferguson,  an 
assistant  professor  of  chemistry  and  biochemistry  at  the  University  of  South  Caro-
lina. Since 2003, I have led a team of researchers at USC, funded by the U.S. EPA 
Science  to  Achieve  Results  (STAR)  program 3 and  organized  within  the  USC  Nano-
Center  investigating  the  fate  and  health  effects  of  nanomaterials  in  the  environ-
ment. Our overall goal is to elucidate the potential for manufactured nanomaterials 
to  be  transported  within  the  aquatic  environment  and  the  associated  hazards  of 
such transport to both aquatic and human life. I feel strongly about the need to con-
tinue and expand this research, and I’m happy to talk with you about it. 

Primary  point:  Development  and  commercialization  of  nanotechnology  may 
present unforeseen hazards to environmental and human health—it is therefore es-
sential that scientific research be conducted to address this issue. 

Since  the  initial  authorization  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  in  2003, 
the Federal Government has continuously supported intramural and extramural sci-
entific  research  into  the  environmental  and  health  impacts  of  nanotechnology.4 As 
a consequence, there exists now a growing body of work addressing the risks associ-
ated with nanomaterials; however, it is clear that we still have much to learn. 

What  we  know:  The  emergence  of  nanotechnology  is  an  exciting  opportunity  that 
could result in significant contributions to the treatment of disease, development of 
more effective polymer composites, fuel cells and capacitors, and clean-up of polluted 
groundwater.  Although  the  use  of  nanoparticles  may  allow  for  significant  advances 
in  science  and  technology,  assessment  of  potential  negative  health  and  environ-
mental  impacts  on  humans,  non-human  biota,  and  ecosystems  is  imperative  before 
their widespread production and use. The same properties that make these particles 
desirable,  may  also  contribute  to  their  toxic  potential  and  extensive  studies  to  ad-
dress both the acute and chronic effects of nanoparticles are necessary to determine 
if  negative  health  and  environmental  impacts  outweigh  the  potential  benefits.  In 
humans,  a  concerning  route  of  exposure  is  via  direct  inhalation,  both  in  the  work-
place  where  these  particles  are  manufactured  and  used,  and  from  the  innate  envi-
ronment  contaminated  with  particles  released  from  anthropogenic  and  natural 
sources.5,6 Other routes of exposure that are currently a concern include dermal and 
dietary. The current state of the science with respect to environmental, health, and 
safety issues of nanotechnology can be summarized briefly. 

• We have learned that nanomaterials are very difficult to measure accurately in 
environmental  and  biological  systems—this  greatly  complicates  assessment  of 
occupational  and  environmental  exposure  as  well  as  occurrence  and  fate  of 
these materials in the environment. It has become clear that existing analytical 
methods  (e.g.,  those  designed  for  detecting  and  quantifying  chemical  contami-
nants)  are  simply  inappropriate  or  insufficient  to  make  these  measurements.7 
• We  also  have  learned  that  nanomaterials  may  be  transported  in  the  environ-
ment in ways that are not necessarily predictable from existing models for more 
conventional  contaminants,  and  that  nanomaterials  may  interact  directly  with 
pollutants-of-concern such as PCBs and heavy metals, potentially leading to mo-
bilization and enhanced toxicity.8 
• Finally, there are clear indications of risks associated with exposure of humans 
and ecosystems to nanomaterials. These risks include direct toxicity and uptake

of  nanomaterials  into  biological  tissues.9,10 However,  the  mechanisms  by  which 
nanomaterials  exert  biological  effects  are  poorly  known  and  there  is  a  clear 
need for basic research directed at new methods for assessing ‘‘nanotoxicology’’. 
Federal  prioritization:  Through  the  NNI,  the  Federal  Government  has  developed 
and refined a roadmap aimed at identifying and prioritizing research needs with re-
spect  to  environmental,  health,  and  safety  issues  of  nanotechnology.11 The  five  pri-
mary research categories identified are: (1) Instrumentation, Metrology, and Analyt-
ical Methods; (2) Nanomaterials and Human Health; (3) Nanomaterials and the En-
vironment; (4) Human and Environmental Exposure Assessment; and (5) Risk Man-
agement Methods. 

The Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) subcommittee of the 
National  Science  and  Technology  Council  (NSTC)  has  done  a  commendable  job  of 
focusing the disparate interests of the Federal agencies party to the NNI such that 
an  organized  effort  can  be  made  to  address  environmental  and  health  impacts  of 
nanotechnology as this technology is developed. This last point is critical—we cannot 
afford to wait until nanotechnology is fully integrated within our commercial enter-
prises  to  begin  assessing  its  risks  and  hazards  to  human  health  and  the  environ-
ment. 

Future  research  needs  and  challenges:  Nanomaterials  have  not  been  well  charac-
terized  in  terms  of  their  environmental  occurrence,  behavior,  and  toxic  potential 
even  though  they  may  contribute  to  occupational  and  general  air/water  pollution 
through manufacturing and waste disposal as well as through inclusion in drug de-
livery  and  therapeutic  applications.  Large  data  gaps  exist  with  regard  to  our  basic 
understanding  of  the  potential  for  manufactured  nanoparticles  to  cause  deleterious 
effects on human as well as ecological systems. 

In  assessing  possible  health  and  environmental  effects  of  manufactured  nano-
materials,  it  is  important  to  study  their  impact  in  relevant  model  systems  and  in 
chemical  forms  reflective  of  occupational/environmental  exposures.  There  are  many 
different  types  of  nanoparticles/nanomaterials  and  each  of  these  will  have  a  behav-
ior  (for  example  toxicity  or  transport)  dictated  by  chemical  and  physical  factors 
unique  to  the  material.  Below,  I  comment  on  specific  areas  of  research  within  the 
framework outlined by the NSET subcommittee that I believe deserve particular at-
tention: 

• Without methods for detecting and characterizing nanomaterials in the environ-
ment and in human tissues, exposure assessment and environmental occurrence 
and  fate  studies  are  impossible.  I  wholeheartedly  agree  with  the  NSET  sub-
committee  that  research  into  analytical  methods  and  metrology  of  nanomate-
rials  is  a  top  priority  and  support  for  this  work  should  be  accelerated  within 
the NNI. 
• With  respect  to  research  on  environmental  and  human  health  effects  of  nano-
materials,  I  stress  the  need  to  develop  standardized  testing  methods  that  are 
appropriate to assessing toxicity and biological uptake of nanomaterials. 
• It  is  clear  from  my  own  work  as  well  as  that  of  others  that  we  must  consider 
not only the health and environmental risks of manufactured nanomaterials but 
also that of byproducts generated during manufacturing. This is a relatively un-
explored area of research and should be considered. 
• There is a critical need to assess routes of human and ecological exposure after 
release  of  nanomaterials  into  the  ambient  environment.  We  still  have  a  very 
limited  knowledge  base  regarding  the  treatability  of  nanotechnology  wastes  as 
well  as  the  routes  by  which  nanomaterials  may  enter  and  move  within  our  air 
and water. This should be a top priority for EHS research within the NNI.

• Finally,  our  ability  to  accurately  assess  and  predict  risk  of  emerging  nanotech-
nologies  to  human  and  environmental  health  is  critically  dependent  on  our  un-
derstanding  of  the  mechanisms  by  which  nanomaterials  act  on  biological  sys-
tems at the cellular and molecular level. This understanding represents a grand 
scientific challenge and will require significant and well-supported effort. 

As you look to reauthorization of the NNI, I ask you to consider the resources that 
are critically needed now and in the future for addressing these emerging concerns. 
In  2005,  expenditures  through  the  NNI  budget  on  nanotechnology-related  EHS  re-
search  totaled  approximately  $35  million  or  3  percent  of  the  total  NNI  budget.  As 
of  today,  the  NNI  budget  request  for  2009  allocates  $76  million  or  approximately 
5  percent  of  the  total  request  to  research  on  EHS  issues  of  nanotechnology.  It  is 
very clear that a significant increase in our collective scientific understanding of the 
environmental and health impacts of nanotechnology will require a more substantial 
investment.  A  realistic  target  in  the  very  near  term  should  be  to  increase  the  level 
of funding for EHS research on nanotechnology to meet or exceed 10 percent of the 
NNI budget. 

I  wish  to  close  by  saying  that  we  have  a  unique  opportunity  now—through  the 
efforts of the NNI we have begun the process of addressing EHS risks of nanotech-
nology simultaneously with the development of this technology. We have only to look 
back  at  the  lessons  learned  from  PCBs  and  other  legacy  chemical  contaminants  to 
realize the dangers of waiting until new technologies are mature to assess their en-
vironmental and health risks. I urge this Committee to consider these concerns dur-
ing the reauthorization of the NNI. Thank you for considering my testimony. In the 
Appendix  below  I  have  included  a  summary  of  the  research  currently  being  con-
ducted  at  the  University  of  South  Carolina  on  environmental  and  human  health 
issues in nanotechnology. 
Appendix:  Ongoing  Research  at  the  University  of  South  Carolina  on  the 
Environmental Fate and Health Effects of Manufactured Nanomaterials

Although  the  use  of  nanomaterials  may  allow  for  significant  advances  in  science 
and technology, assessment of potential negative health and environmental impacts 
on  humans,  non-human  biota,  and  ecosystems  is  imperative.  The  same  properties 
that make these particles desirable, may also contribute to their toxic potential. Our 
research  team  at  USC  is  studying  the  potential  toxic  effects  that  various  nanopar-
ticles  have  on  humans,  microbial  communities,  and  aquatic  ecosystems.  This  is  an 
interdisciplinary effort which involves cooperation among chemists, physicists, biolo-
gists, toxicologists, and microbial ecologists, among others. The focus of our research 
efforts  are  described  below.  For  more  information,  please  visit  http://www.nano 
.sc.edu/thrust—nanoenvir.asp. 
Subproject #1: Pulmonary Toxicity of Nanomaterials 
Project leaders: Tara Sabo-Attwood and Gene Feigley 

In humans, the dominant route of exposure is suspected to occur via direct inhala-
tion,  both  in  the  workplace  where  these  particles  are  manufactured  and  used,  and 
from the environment contaminated with particles released from anthropogenic and 
natural sources. Health-effects studies of air exposure to nanomaterials will require 
design  of  novel  inhalation  toxicology  facilities  and  filtration  technologies  not  avail-
able presently in the United States. Our group is uniquely qualified to design, build 
and test a small-scale prototype facility to assess aerosol generation, fate and trans-
port. Construction of this prototype will lead to the development of inhalation expo-
sure protocols for relevant animal models to assess the toxicological impacts of nano-
particles.  In  addition,  we  have  already  established  complimentary  in  vitro  studies 
that  reveal  toxic  effects  of  single-walled  carbon  nanotube  (SWNT)  in  human  lung 
cells, and are currently exploring the molecular mechanisms responsible for this tox-
icity.

Subproject  #2:  Environmental  Fate,  Transport  and  Toxicity  of  Carbon 

Nanomaterials in Aqueous Systems 

Project leaders: Tom Chandler, Lee Ferguson, Shosaku Kashiwada 
Project Focus: 
Synthesis of unique radioisotope-labeled nanomaterials for toxicological, fate and en-

vironmental transformation studies 

Single-walled  carbon  nanotube  (SWNT)  fate  in  aquatic/sedimentary  systems  is 
still  largely  under-explored.  The  USEPA  has  supported  research  by  our  team  at 
USC aimed at elucidating the toxic effects and environmental fate and transport be-
havior  of  SWNT  in  estuarine  environments.  Our  results  have  shown  that  manufac-
turing  byproducts  of  SWNT  are  toxic  to  estuarine  meiobenthic  copepods  and  that 
copepods  ingest  but  do  not  bioaccumulate  SWNT  from  sediments.  In  addition,  we 
have  shown  that  SWNT  are  highly  sorptive  to  hydrophobic  organic  contaminants 
such  as  PCBs  and  PAHs,  and  that  organisms  ingesting  SWNTs  with  associated  or-
ganic contaminants can bioaccumulate the associated organics in their tissues. Stud-
ies on environmental fate of SWNT under simulated estuarine conditions reveal that 
SWNT  materials  aggregate  strongly  and  agglomerate  to  natural  particles  (e.g.,  clay 
and  sand)  in  the  presence  of  high  ionic  strength  solutions  (e.g.,  seawater),  but  that 
this behavior is inhibited by the presence of high concentrations of dissolved organic 
matter. 

As  part  of  our  EPA-funded  research,  we  have  been  developing  a  repository  of 
pure,  radio-labeled  carbonaceous  nanomaterials  for  national  environmental  toxi-
cology  and  chemistry  uses.  With  our  collaborator  Research  Triangle  Institute,  Inc. 
we  have  custom  synthesized  single-walled  carbon  nanotubes.  We  are  using  these 
materials  to  perform  experiments  aimed  at  uptake/bioaccumulation  and  linked 
acute/chronic toxicity of SWNTs in at least two model invertebrate systems, fish and 
marine  invertebrates  (copepods).  The  14C-SWNT  materials  are  also  being  used  to 
study  particulate  sorption,  aggregation,  transport  in  porous  media,  and  bio/ 
phototransformation in a laboratory setting. 
Subproject #3: Microbial Applications and Degradation of Nanomaterials 
Project leaders: Alan Decho, Sean Norman, John Ferry 

Biofilms  consist  of  bacteria  cells  attached  to  a  surface  that  produce  a  large  net-
work of extracellular polymeric secretions (EPS). In doing so, bacterial cells are able 
to protect themselves against antimicrobial agents, and manipulate their local envi-
ronment.  Biofilms  commonly  occur  in  natural  and  engineered  environments.  How-
ever,  their  presence  often  incurs  multibilllion  dollar  costs  for  hospitals  (e.g.,  most 
hospital-acquired  infections  are  biofilms),  industry  (e.g.,  cause  metal  corrosion  and 
biofouling,  reduce  heat  transfer  efficiency),  potable  water  system  maintenance  (i.e., 
protect pathogenic bacteria against chlorination), as well as being important in nat-
ural environments. Our research focuses on using nannoparticles to detect and mon-
itor biofilms, study how the nanoparticles are captured and sequestered, and deter-
mine if the bacteria degrade these particles in various settings. 

• Biofilm  Nanosensors:  Understanding  biofilm  processes,  and  controlling  their 
costly  effects  is  important  has  important  economic,  health,  and  environmental 
implications.  The  development  of  specific  Nanosensors  for  monitoring  bacterial 
processes within biofilms is an important step in the in-situ detection and moni-
toring of biofilm processes. Our studies aim to develop specific sensors that can 
be  ‘captured’  by  a  biofilm,  then  provide  important  physical/chemical/metabolic 
information regarding processes occurring within the biofilm. 
• Capture  and  Sequestration  of  NanoParticles  by  Biofilms.  Bacterial  biofilm  are 
an  efficient  filter  for  particulates,  colloids  and  dissolved  molecules.  They  are 
likely  important  in  the  capture  and  concentration  of  nanoparticles  under  dif-
ferent  Environmental  conditions.  We  strive  to:  (1)  understand  how  biofilms  se-
quester  nanoparticulates,  and  (2)  manipulate  biofilms  to  enhance  capture  effi-
ciency. 
• Biofilm  Test  Systems:  This  phase  involves  the  development  of  biofilm  culture 
systems  that  accurately  mimic  natural  biofilm  populations.  Such  systems  will 
be coupled to CSLM, Raman/CSLM, and other analysis instrumentation for pre-
cise  testing  of  antimicrobial  approaches  on  living  and  engineered  nanosurfaces. 

Microbial Interactions and Degradation 

This project is directed at determining the influence of nanomaterials on environ-
mental  microbial  activity.  Nanomaterials  have  unique  antimicrobial  properties  that 
may  be  exploited  in  environmental  disinfection  and/or  infection  control.  There  are

also  therapeutic  applications  for  this  research  relative  to  artificial  implants,  pros-
theses, etc. 

Specific Goals: Particular attention will be paid to questions such as: Do the mate-
rials in question support or inhibit the formation of biofilm communities? Are micro-
bial communities capable of affecting the structure of associated nanomaterials (i.e., 
metabolically transforming them)? Do nanomaterials exert selective population pres-
sure  on  microbial  communities  (i.e.,  selectively  targeting  one  particular  type  of  mi-
crobe vs another in mixtures)? 

We will develop ‘nanoprobes’ (fluor-, SERS-based) for biofilm investigations in en-
vironmental  studies.  We  will  also  develop/build  biofilm  flow-through  cells  and  bio-
reactors  for  live  culturing,  and  observation,  of  biofilms  in  the  presence/absence  of 
nanomaterials  using  our  new  confocal  (CSLM)  and  Raman-confocal  systems  in 
ENHS. 
Subproject #4: Photocatalysis of Reactions Mediated by Nanomaterials 
Project leaders: John Ferry, Tom Vogt 
Project Focus: 

Development  of  nanostructured  materials  with  applications  for  environmental 
modification or remediation is the focus of this project. We are primarily interested 
in  developing  mixed  metal  oxide  visible  light  activated  photocatalysts  for  effecting 
sunlight activated oxidation in the aqueous phase. The materials focus will be active 
catalysts (nanoparticulate metal oxides) that engage in direct electron transfer with 
substrates and passive materials that may exhibit catalytic properties by promoting 
close association (such as various nanocarbons). We will monitor the degradation of 
catalytically active nanomaterials in environmental matrices, using microscopic and 
molecular  techniques.  We  will  assay  the  catalytic  activity  of  the  material  during 
degradation,  which  is  an  exploratory  evaluation  of  the  structure  activity  relation-
ship. We will assay the physico-chemical behavior of the material upon exposure to 
environmental conditions (e.g., aggregation, adsorption of ‘‘poisons’’ that affect cata-
lyst activity, etc). We will explore application venues for materials that are effective 
photoactivated  oxidants  (drinking  water  and  surface  disinfection,  biomedical  appli-
cations, etc). 
Subproject #5: Plant Interactions with Nanoparticles 
Project leaders; Lee Newman, Tara Sabo-Attwood, Jason Unrine, Cathy Murphy 
Project Focus: 

Plant uptake and response to nanoparticles will have significance on many levels. 
First and foremost is to understand the parameters of plant uptake of the particles; 
what types (i.e., chemical composition) of particles are taken up, is there a size limit 
or  shape  preference,  do  the  chemicals  used  to  cap  the  particles  impact  uptake? 
Could  plant  compounds  affect  the  bioavailability  of  particles  in  a  natural  system? 
In  independent  studies,  we  have  already  exposed  the  model  plant,  Nictoianna 
xanthi,  to  several  different  sized  gold  nanosphere,  gold  nanosheres  with  different 
capping  chemicals,  and  silver  nanospheres.  Through  simple  light  microscopy  we 
have  identified  spheres  of  3–5nm  within  the  vascular  tissue  of  the  roots  of  the 
plants,  and  aggregation  of  larger  spheres  on  the  outside  of  the  roots.  We  have  ob-
served  enhanced  precipitation  of  the  particles  when  exposed  to  root  exudates.  We 
have  also  had  a  plants  analyzed  by  one  the  using  the  beam  lines  at  Brookhaven 
National  Laboratory’s  Synchrotron  Light  Source,  and  had  XANES  collected  for  se-
lected  areas  of  the  plants  analyzed.  We  found  that  the  particles  were  retained  as 
gold,  and  not  gold  salts  within  the  plant,  and  that  the  pattern  of  accumulation  dif-
fered within the plant tissues.

is 

cuses on creating innovation at the nexus of physics, medicine and 
nanotechnology.  Nanobiosym  Diagnostics 
focused  single- 
mindedly on commercializing a chip technology we’ve developed out 
of  that  nexus  which  will  enable  a  future  cell  phone-like  device  in 
which you could put a drop of blood or saliva on a chip, stick it into 
the device and within a few minutes be able to diagnose what kind 
of infectious disease a person has. 

This  has,  of  course,  many  markets  in  the  developed  world,  but 
we’re  also  looking  at  commercializing  this  in  the  developing  world. 
I want to share with the Committee a few aspects of our experience 
in doing that. 

Taking  the  ability  of  diagnosing  disease  out  of  a  pathology  lab 
and  the  basement  of  a  hospital  and  putting  it  into  people’s  own 
hands  will  have  a  transformative  effect  on  healthcare  globally,  be-
cause  it  will  bring  the  ability  to  diagnose  disease  into  doctors’  of-
fices,  patients’  bedsides,  people’s  homes,  or  even  into  rural  remote 
villages around the world. 

My own background for the past 5 years I’ve been a nanotechnol-
ogy  entrepreneur  and  over  15  years  have  been  a  scientist  in  the 
field of nanotechnology, originally beginning at Stanford before the 
word  ‘‘nanotechnology’’  became  a  buzzword  and  then  at  Harvard 
and MIT where I did my Ph.D. in Physics and an M.D. in medicine, 
two  fields  which  traditionally  haven’t  talked  to  each  other  but  in 
my own mind come together at the nanoscale. 

The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  has  been  critical  to  my 
company.  It  has  not  only  helped  us  in  terms  of  direct  funding  but 
it  has  been  instrumental  in  creating  the  landscape  and  the  infra-
structure  for  innovation  and  that’s  been  important  in  creating  the 
environment that was needed for what we did. 

I  believe  that  the  next  5  years  could  be  even  more  profound  if 
we  make  the  right  decisions,  because  as  a  Nation,  we’re  really 
poised  at  the  juxtaposition  or  a  junction  between  basic  R&D  and 
commercialization.  At  Nanobiosym,  we  are  not  only  commer-
cializing our research by translating these basic insights into prod-
ucts,  but  also  seeking  to  maximize  the  impact  these  insights  can 
have on global challenges. 

From our experience in bridging the gamut from basic R&D inno-
vation  to  establishing  proof  of  concept  to  commercializing  products 
and  also  penetrating  into  emerging  global  markets,  I  believe  there 
are four key lessons that we have learned that I would like to sug-
gest  to  this  Committee  to  consider  as  they  build  the  roadmap  for 
the NNI reauthorization. 

Number  (1)  Let’s  talk  about  education.  Obviously  we  need  a 
qualified  work  force,  but  more  than  that,  we  need  to  think  about 
the kind of people we are creating. We need to look at transcending 
conventional boundaries in our educational system, the boundaries 
between  different  academic  disciplines,  the  boundaries  between 
academia  and  corporate  training  programs,  and  even  between  the 
United States and international training programs. 

Just  like  other  countries  send  their  students  and  people  to  train 
in  our  country,  I  think  we  need  to  send  our  people  worldwide  not 
only  to  train  about  nanotechnology  but  also  to  learn  about  the 
broader global context.

Number (2) Bridging the gap between fundamental research and 
products and commercialization. There are programs like the SBIR 
and the TIP Program which are very instrumental in bridging that 
valley of death, if you will, but, you know, there are other countries 
that  are  investing  very  heavily  into  very  concentrated  areas  as  a 
strategy,  economic  development  strategy,  if  you  will,  to  leapfrog 
themselves into a major player in the nanotechnology economy. 

I  think  an  analogy  can  be  drawn  with  the  automobile  industry 
where, as you know, many countries can focus on building the best 
bumper  or  the  best  headlight.  As  Americans,  however,  we’re 
uniquely  positioned  to  create  an  entire  nanotechnology  economy. 
Just as we created the automobile economy that enabled us to cap-
italize on its mobility and create a whole system of jobs and infra-
structure. 

I  think  we  need  to  focus  on  how  nanotechnology  works  at  the 
systems level, not only in basic research but also bridging into com-
mercial products and solving global problems. 

Number (3) The third key lesson is the broader impact nanotech-
nology can have on global challenges, whether it be the energy cri-
sis, the environmental problem or healthcare. 

Because  it’s  such  an  interdisciplinary  field  where  many  fields 
come  together  in  one  melting  pot  and  it  has  impact  across  various 
sectors,  it  really  provides  unique  fresh  approach  to  create,  if  you 
will, disruptive solutions to existing global challenges. 

In  my  company,  for  example,  not  only  are  we  looking  at  taking 
our  technology  to  impact  the  way  healthcare  is  practiced  here  and 
around  the  world  but  we  are  seeing  that  the  same  platform  tech-
nology  has  impact  on  food  testing,  water  safety  testing,  environ-
mental testing, even crop pathogen testing. 

So the same platforms can have many different kinds of applica-
tions.  We  need  to  think  more  broadly  and  more  holistically  in 
terms  of  how  we  leverage  what  we  have.  There’s  a  lot  of  concern 
these days about the potential negative impacts on safety or on the 
environment  of  nanotechnology.  I  think  that  nanotechnology  can 
help  be  part  of  the  solution,  not  the  problem,  if  we  broaden  our 
view. 

Number  (4)  Fourth,  I  think  there’s  a  historically  unique  oppor-
tunity right now to bring emerging technologies into emerging glob-
al  markets.  I  think  that  fields  like  nanotechnology  are  going  to 
force us to think and even act globally. 

In  our  company,  for  example,  we  follow  the  precedent  of  the  cell 
phone  industry.  In  the  telecom  field,  you  saw  a  paradigm  shift 
when communications and computing devices became portable. You 
saw  even  poor  villagers  and  beggars  in  developing  world  countries 
starting  to  use  cell  phones  once  the  cost  came  down.  Part  of  it  is 
they didn’t have the land line infrastructure to displace. 

We  envision  driving  a  similar  paradigm  shift  in  the  healthcare 
industry  where  the  ability  to  diagnose  disease  can  be  taken  out  of 
a  hospital  and  put  into  people’s  own  hands  and  even  transported 
to remote areas of the world. I believe the key to doing that is cut-
ting the cost, making it affordable, but also forming global partner-
ships. 

Part of our strategy as a company has been, and I would propose 
the  Committee  consider  this  as  part  of  their  roadmap,  is  that  we

72 

as  Americans  should  engage  other  global  partners  in  addressing 
global  challenges  and  adopting  some  of  the  developing  world  prob-
lems as part of our own because part of those problems help stimu-
late new solutions. 

Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  you,  Chairman  Kerry,  as  well  as 
the members of the Committee. Let me end by saying I believe we 
are  uniquely  poised  to  harness  nanotechnology  to  fuel  and  revi-
talize our own economy if we think about it in a more global fash-
ion. 

Thank you very much. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Goel follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANITA GOEL,  M.D.,  PH.D.,  FOUNDER,  CHAIRMAN,  AND 
SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR,  NANOBIOSYM,  INC.  AND FOUNDER,  CHAIRMAN,  AND CEO, 
NANOBIOSYM DIAGNOSTICS, INC. 
Chairman  Kerry,  Ranking  Member  Ensign,  and  members  of  the  Subcommittee,  I 
would  like  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  reauthorization  of  the 
National Nanotechnology Initiative. 

My  name  is  Dr.  Anita  Goel,  and  I  am  the  Founder,  Chairman,  and  Scientific  Di-
rector  of  Nanobiosym,  Inc.  and  the  Founder,  Chairman,  and  CEO  of  Nanobiosym 
Diagnostics,  Inc.  Nanobiosym  was  founded  as  an  idea  lab  and  research  institute  to 
innovate  at  the  convergence  of  physics,  medicine  and  nanotechnology.  Nanobiosym, 
and its commercial partner Nanobiosym Diagnostics, have been privately developing 
Gene-RADAR,  a  portable  nanotechnology-enabled  platform  that  can  rapidly  and 
accurately  detect  genetic  fingerprints  from  any  biological  organism.  The  company’s 
vision is to give patients worldwide real-time access to their own diagnostic informa-
tion via low-cost handheld devices. We are based in Medford, Massachusetts. 

I  first  began  working  as  a  scientist  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology  over  fifteen 
years  ago  at  Stanford  University—well  before  the  term  ‘‘nanotechnology’’  had  be-
come a buzz word. I simultaneously trained as both a physicist and physician, with 
my  PhD  in  Physics  from  Harvard  University  and  my  MD  from  the  Harvard-MIT 
Joint  Division  of  Health  Sciences  and  Technology  (HST).  For  almost  5  years  now, 
I  have  been  a  nanotechnology  entrepreneur  as  the  Founder,  Chairman,  and  CEO 
of  Nanobiosym  and  Nanobiosym  Diagnostics.  We  are  developing  commercial  prod-
ucts targeted for global markets—in both the developed and developing worlds. 
What is Nanotechnology? 

Nanotechnology  to  me  is  the  ability  to  probe  and  control  matter  and  systems  on 
increasingly  finer  scales,  at  the  nanoscale  (10∧-9  m)  and  smaller.  This  is  important 
because it gives us a new level of control over matter. Nanotechnology is a platform 
science which combines several traditional fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, 
and medicine. The applications that stem from these capabilities likewise cut across 
several  different  sectors  from  medicine  and  energy  to  the  environment  and  mate-
rials  science.  For  example,  the  ability  to  control  the  assembly  and  arrangement  of 
atoms and molecules in a nanomaterial could give it the durability of steel and the 
weight of plastic. 

Nanotechnology provides a platform for innovation across conventional boundaries 
of science, technology, and commerce. Furthermore, by its intrinsic multidisciplinary 
nature,  it  fosters  collaboration  across  conventional  political  and  economic  bound-
aries. 
Nanobiosym and the National Nanotechnology Initiative 

Nanobiosym  has  been  the  direct  beneficiary  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Ini-
tiative. Without the resources that the Initiative brought to bear—not only funding, 
but  also  coordination  and  a  sense  of  national  priority—Nanobiosym  would  not  be 
where it is today. We have been fortunate to work with several of the agencies par-
ticipating in the Initiative, and have received multiple rounds of competitive funding 
grants  from  DARPA,  AFOSR,  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  SBIR  funding  from  DOE,  and 
now more recently were awarded a defense contract from DTRA as some of our tech-
nology  platforms  transitioned  from  the  pure  R&D  stage  to  the  more  applied  or 
prototyping stage. 

As  the  Subcommittee  considers  how  best  to  update  and  improve  the  Initiative,  I 
hope that our experience as an emerging nanotechnology company (in moving across 
the  gamut  from  science  and  technology  innovation,  to  proof  of  concept  development 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:11 May 24, 2012 Jkt 074321 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74321.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

73 

and developing commercial products for global markets) will help identify what has 
worked well and what could be improved to encourage other companies like us. 
The Need for Reauthorization 

As Congress begins to consider reauthorizing the National Nanotechnology Initia-
tive,  it  is  important  to  understand  that  because  the  original  authorization  was  so 
successful,  the  Nation’s  nanotechnology  landscape  dramatically  changed  in  the  last 
5  years.  The  21st  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act  focused 
primarily  on  basic  research.  This  led  to  dynamic  growth  in  America’s  nanotechnol-
ogy  research  infrastructure  primarily  in  academic  settings,  and  sowed  the  seeds  of 
nanotechnology commercialization throughout the country. 

Today, 5 years later, we are beginning to see the results of this initial investment, 
as  nanotechnology-enabled  products  start  to  enter  the  marketplace  across  the  spec-
trum  of  industry  sectors,  from  water  purification  to  materials  engineering  to 
healthcare.  While  the  success  of  the  first  5  years  gives  us  great  hope,  however,  I 
cannot impress upon the Subcommittee enough that the growth of the next 5 years 
could be exponential. Building on the success of the National Nanotechnology Initia-
tive’s  first  5  years,  the  United  States  has  a  historic  opportunity  to  drive  nanotech-
nology  to  maximize  its  impact  on  global  challenges,  including  health,  environment, 
energy, and even building the new global economy. 

The  reauthorization  of  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  should  focus  on 

four new areas in addition to basic research: 

1. improving nanotechnology education, which will supply a qualified workforce 
for the American and global nanotechnology economy; 
2.  bridging  the  gap  between  research  and  commercialization,  which  will  help 
America drive the global nanotechnology revolution; 
3.  addressing  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  other  global  challenges,  which 
will  ensure  that  we  can  enjoy  the  many  benefits  of  nanotechnology  while  ad-
dressing any risks that may arise; and 
4. bringing emerging technologies into emerging global markets. 

Each  of  these  four  areas  has  a  direct  impact  on  my  company.  Progress  in  each 
will  enable  Nanobiosym  to  bring  its  lifesaving  products  to  market  faster,  to  expand 
and provide quality jobs for more people, and to market our products to global mar-
kets in both the developed and developing world. 
A  Roadmap  for  Harnessing  Nanotechnology  to  Drive  the  New  Global 

Economy 

1. Nanotechnology Education 

If America is going to compete effectively in the global nanotechnology revolution, 
we need a highly skilled and qualified work force. We need scientists, engineers, and 
technicians who have a vision for nanotechnology, seek to innovate with it, and are 
capable of working at the nanoscale. We need professors and teachers who can edu-
cate about the nano world and we need business professionals who can turn the sci-
entists’  work  into  useful  products.  It  is  already  difficult  to  meet  the  demand  for 
PhDs  with  nanotechnology  backgrounds,  and  that  demand  will  only  increase  in  the 
coming years. 

We  need  to  spark  interest  in  nanoscience,  starting  in  grade  school.  We  need  to 
build a nanotech pipeline in education which will allow for a steady stream of quali-
fied personnel to supply our labs and companies. 

Nanotechnology education, like nanotechnology research, is necessarily multidisci-
plinary.  Because  nanotechnology  spans  physics,  materials  science,  chemistry,  and 
biology, it needs to be taught throughout the science curriculum. And like other sub-
jects,  nanotechnology  is  best  learned  by  doing.  Programs  that  improve  access  to 
basic nanotechnology tools will help inspire a new generation of students to pursue 
careers in science because they will be able to see firsthand nanotechnology’s poten-
tial. 

Our  education  system  must  start  transcending  conventional  boundaries  between 
academic  disciplines,  between  academic  and  corporate  training  programs,  and  be-
tween  U.S.  and  international  training  experiences.  I  would  suggest  the  creation  of 
more  international  exchange  programs.  Just  as  other  countries  send  their  students 
here,  we  should  start  sending  our  people  around  the  world  to  be  trained  not  only 
in nanotechnology but its broader international context. 

The  reauthorization  bill  will  be  an  excellent  investment  in  America’s  future  if  it 
promotes  nanotechnology  education  from  grade  school  through  graduate  school.  If 
it  does  not,  we  will  continue  to  rely  in  the  short  term  on  foreign  science  students 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:11 May 24, 2012 Jkt 074321 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74321.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

74 

who will often end up returning to their home countries to compete against us after 
completing their studies. 
2. Bridging the Gap Between Nanotechnology Research and Commercialization 

As  the  Members  of  this  Subcommittee  know,  America’s  competitiveness  in  the 
global  market  is  being  tested  in  the  field  of  nanotechnology,  where  Russia,  China, 
Japan,  the  European  Union,  and  other  nations  are  making  major  investments  in 
translating  basic  research  into  marketable  nanotechnology  products.  Often,  foreign 
governments  are  pursuing  a  strategy  of  letting  American  researchers  do  the  basic 
science, then using their resources to commercialize that research and gain the eco-
nomic benefit. Having invested in the early days of nanotechnology research and in-
novation,  we  should  not  miss  the  opportunity  to  fully  commercialize  our  own  re-
search. 

Programs  such  as  Small  Business  Innovation  Research,  Small  Business  Tech-
nology Transfer, and the new Technology Innovation Program are vital mechanisms 
for bringing technology out of the lab and into the marketplace. They provide need-
ed  resources  and  expertise  to  emerging  small  businesses,  and  they  help  bring  new 
technology  and  new  jobs  into  existence.  They  bridge  the  ‘‘valley  of  death’’  that  lies 
between  basic  research  funding  and  late-stage  commercial  funding—a  valley  that 
would  otherwise  swallow  many  more  promising  companies.  As  the  Subcommittee 
drafts the reauthorization legislation, I urge you to ensure that these programs play 
a major part in the bill. 

In  my  own  experience,  programs  like  SBIR  have  enabled  companies  like  ours  to 
stay  focused  on  more  disruptive  innovations  even  when  they  are  not  the  lowest 
hanging  fruit  in  terms  of  revenue  generation.  In  practice,  such  programs  keep 
American  innovation  at  the  cutting  edge  as  we  continue  to  meet  real-time  market 
needs. 

Rapid commercialization is important, but goal-oriented research also will help ac-
celerate  the  path  to  market  for  nanotech  companies.  Many  emerging  countries  are 
focusing  on  this  strategy  to  leapfrog  themselves  into  significant  roles  in  the  global 
economy.  For  example,  countries  like  Taiwan  have  determined  that,  although  they 
may  not  be  able  to  challenge  the  United  States  across  the  board,  they  can  compete 
effectively  if  they  concentrate  their  resources.  By  conducting  goal-oriented  research 
in  a  key  area  such  as  electronics  or  display  technologies,  they  can  achieve  a  strong 
position in those markets. 

We  can  do  the  same  thing.  Already,  we  have  had  tremendous  success  with  goal- 
oriented  research  in  cancer  treatment  and  other  health-related  areas.  Identifying 
and  pursuing  other  key  goals,  such  as  nanomedicine,  energy,  electronics,  or  water 
purification,  will  help  ensure  that  we  are  getting  the  most  for  our  research  money. 
As  someone  who  practically  embodies  the  concept  of  ‘‘multidisciplinary  research,’’ 
I would encourage the Subcommittee to see to it that goal-oriented research centers 
cross traditional scientific and agency boundaries. The National Science Foundation 
and the Department of Energy should be working together; NIST should be working 
with  EPA;  and  so  forth.  I  have  seen  the  beginnings  of  such  multidisciplinary  re-
search under the current National Nanotechnology Initiative, and the results are in-
deed  encouraging.  I  see  this  in  my  own  company  every  day,  and  I  know  it  works. 
Goal-oriented work and cooperation will go far to expedite commercialization and 
provide a more efficient path to market for many businesses and products. I caution 
the Committee, however, not to get trapped by lesser goals while losing sight of the 
bigger  picture.  It  is  one  thing  to  make  products  based  on  nanotechnology  research; 
it  is  another  to  build  a  nanotechnology  economy.  The  goal-oriented  nanotech  re-
search of competing economies is understandable given their resources. But it is one 
thing  to  be  simply  the  supplier  of  a  bumper,  or  a  headlight,  or  a  mechanical  part 
for  an  automobile;  it  is  another  thing  to  build  an  economy  based  on  the  mobility 
the automobile enabled, which spawned multiple new industries and employed mil-
lions. So it could be with nanotechnology. 

It is true that goal-specific research will be important, as will support for commer-
cialization  and  collaboration  between  agencies.  It  will  be  this  understanding  of  the 
nano-based economy that will differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to 
make  the  best  decisions  about  where  to  invest  our  resources.  This  understanding 
will also enable us to take a fresh approach to American leadership in the new glob-
al economy. 
3.  The  Broader  Impact  of  Nanotechnology  on  Environmental,  Health,  Safety  and 

other Global Challenges 

A comprehensive, strategic approach to understanding the environmental, health, 
and  safety  effects  of  nanotechnology  is  a  necessary  component  of  any  Federal  plan 
at  this  point.  With  nanotechnology  products  entering  the  commercial  market,  it  is 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:11 May 24, 2012 Jkt 074321 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\74321.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

75 

important  that  we  know  how  nanoparticles  behave  in  the  body  and  in  the  environ-
ment.  Just  as  important  is  the  need  to  communicate  with  consumers  so  that  they 
understand  the  efforts  that  are  underway  to  determine  and  address  any  risks  that 
may  exist.  The  last  thing  that  any  nanotechnology  company  wants  is  for  a  lack  of 
safety data to scare consumers into staying away. The field has learned the lessons 
of the genetically-modified food debacle. 

That  said,  however,  Nanobiosym’s  experience  represents  a  different  part  of  the 
issue.  Amid  the  concern  about  potential  negative  environmental,  health,  and  safety 
impacts,  it  is  easy  to  forget  that  nanotechnology  can  be  much  more  of  an  environ-
mental,  health,  and  safety  solution  than  a  problem.  For  example,  Nanobiosym’s 
products will improve health both here and in the developing world by rapidly diag-
nosing  infectious  disease.  Soon,  we  plan  to  expand  into  water  and  food  testing. 
When  it  hits  its  stride,  my  company  will  be  an  environmental,  health  and  safety 
solution, not a problem. 

Although  I  am  proud  of  our  technology  and  the  contribution  it  will  make,  many 
other nanotechnology companies are making similar contributions to environmental, 
health,  and  safety  issues.  From  fuel  cells  to  LED  lights,  from  cancer  treatments  to 
antibacterial surfaces, and from strong composite materials to aircraft metal fatigue 
sensors,  nanotechnology  products  are  beginning  to  clean  up  the  environment,  cure 
people and keep them healthy, and save lives by preventing accidents. These trends 
will only accelerate as nanotechnology becomes more widespread. 
4. Bringing Emerging Technologies into Emerging Global Markets 

I envision that the new global economy will take shape as the economies of major 
nations  become  more  interdependent  and  intertwined  via  science,  technology,  and 
commerce. Nanotechnology by its very multidisciplinary and international nature is 
thus likely to play a major role in driving the new global economy. 

Nanotechnology  will  spur  American  entrepreneurs  to  think  and  act  even  more 
globally.  As  Americans,  we  should  take  a  bold  step  toward  global  leadership  in  the 
nanotechnology  revolution  by  engaging  other  players  around  the  world  and  also  by 
embracing  global  challenges  (such  as  the  energy  crisis,  global  health,  and  the  envi-
ronment)  as  our  own  including  those  of  the  developing  world.  Together  we  should 
focus  on  using  our  best  scientific  and  technological  tools  to  solve  real-world  prob-
lems. 

For  example,  at  Nanobiosym  we  have  developed  a  technology  platform  that  has 
both biodefense applications and clinical diagnostic markets here in the U.S. as well 
as  in  the  developing  world.  The  very  nature  of  the  way  innovation  and  commer-
cialization is proceeding in nanotech enables us to reach out to a global market. For 
example our product, because of its portability and small size, has a large potential 
in  the  developing  world.  Similar  to  the  cell  phone  industry  which  has  made  a  dis-
ruptive  impact  on  telecommunications  in  emerging  markets,  there  are  six  billion 
people  on  Earth  and  everybody  gets  infected  at  some  point  in  their  life.  If  we  can 
make our products cheap enough we can improve global healthcare as well as cater 
to the needs of a growing multibillion-dollar market. 
Conclusion 

I  would  like  to  thank  you,  Chairman  Kerry,  Ranking  Member  Ensign,  and  the 
members of the Subcommittee once again for the invitation to testify today, and for 
your leadership in working to ensure that America can harness the nanotechnology 
revolution to not only revitalize its economy but also drive and help shape the new 
global economy. Building on the success of the National Nanotechnology Initiative’s 
first  5  years,  the  United  States  has  a  historic  opportunity  to  drive  nanotechnology 
to maximize its impact on global challenges. The economic and humanitarian bene-
fits of driving this nanotechnology revolution will be tremendous, and the reauthor-
ization of the National Nanotechnology Initiative will go a long way toward putting 
America at the forefront of this global revolution. 

As the CEO of an emerging nanotechnology business with global aspirations, I am 

certainly grateful for the support. 

Senator KERRY. Thank you very much, Dr. Goel. 
Dr. Heath?

STATEMENT OF JIM HEATH, ELIZABETH W. GILLOON 

PROFESSOR AND PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY; DIRECTOR, 
NANOSYSTEMS BIOLOGY CANCER CENTER, CALIFORNIA 

INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 

Dr.  HEATH.  Senator  Kerry  and  colleagues,  about  a  decade  ago, 
the  late  Rick  Smalley  sat  before  this  very  same  Senate  Committee 
when  it  was  considering  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative. 
Rick  won  the  1996  Nobel  Prize  in  Chemistry  for  his  discovery  of 
C60,  known  as  Buckminsterfullerenes  and  the  class  of  all  carbon 
molecules known as the fullerenes—molecules which in many ways 
have become the poster children of nanotechnology. 

I  also  had  a  part  in  that  discovery.  It  was  my  dissertation  work 
and  Rick  was  my  Ph.D.  advisor  and  thus  it’s  a  special  honor  to  be 
here today. 

Senator KERRY. Can you pull the microphone closer to you? 
Dr. HEATH. How’s that? 
Senator KERRY. Thanks. 
Dr.  HEATH.  Anyway,  thus  it’s  a  special  honor  to  be  here  today 
and  I  want  to  recall  a  little  bit  of  Rick’s  testimony  from  a  decade 
ago. 

He said, and I quote, ‘‘I sit before you here today with very little 
hair  on  my  head.’’  That’s  obviously  a  quote.  ‘‘As  a  result  of  chemo-
therapy. I’m not complaining. Twenty years ago, I would already be 
dead,  but  20  years  from  now,  we  will  no  longer  have  to  use  this 
blunt  tool.  Nanotechnology  will  have  given  us  engineered  drugs 
which  are  nanoscale  cancer-seeking  missiles,  a  molecular  tech-
nology  that  specifically  targets  just  the  cancer  cells  and  leaves  ev-
erything else blissfully alone. I may not live to see it but I am con-
fident it will happen.’’ 

Well,  Rick  was  prophetic  on  both  accounts.  He  didn’t  live  to  see 
it  but  it’s  happening  now  and  it’s  happening  faster  than  he  envi-
sioned it happening. 

One  example  comes  from  my  colleague  at  Caltech,  Mark  Davis. 
Mark is a member of the Cancer Center I direct. It was one of the 
few  nanotechnology-based  cancer  centers  the  NCI  founded  a  few 
years ago. Mark developed a nanotherapeutic that begins to mimic 
Rick’s  cancer-seeking  nanotech  missiles.  He  put  this  into  a  Phase 
I trial and a patient came into this Phase I trial that had late-stage 
metastatic pancreatic cancer. 

I  know  there’s  a  lot  of—probably  a  number  of  folks  in  this  room 
that have had cancer but if you had had late-stage metastatic pan-
creatic  cancer,  you  probably  wouldn’t  be  here  today.  The  survival 
rate for that disease is almost zero. 

In  these  Phase  I  trials,  the  patients  that  come  in  are  ones  that 
have  failed  every  other  type  of  therapy.  They’re  on  their  last  hope 
basically,  and  this  patient  had  two  to  3  months  left  to  live.  Well, 
as  of  today,  and  this  is  2  years  later,  this  patient  is  still  living,  is 
cancer free, and went to through the entire trial without even hair 
loss. That’s a stunning result. 

Now  the  chemotherapy  was  actually  a  typical  chemotherapeutic 
drug.  It  was  one  that  would  lead  to  side  effects,  such  as  hair  loss 
or  cardiac  arrest,  but  the  nanotherapeutic,  which  was  the  delivery 
system that delivered that drug, basically permitted the dose to be

lowered  twenty-fold  and  therefore  lowering  the  toxicity.  It  also  di-
rected more effective delivery of the drug to the cancer. 

The  scientific  foundation  for  that  drug  is  what  the  National 
Nanotechnology Initiative has delivered. Each of the nanoparticles, 
for  example,  is  designed  to  look  friendly  to  the  immune  system,  to 
stay  in  the  blood  for  days  until  it  finds  the  tumor,  and  not  to  re-
lease  their  drug  payload  until  the  nanotherapeutic  is  actually  in-
side the cancer cells. None of this is by accident. 

In  fact,  a  lot  of  the  research  that  went  into  making  that  happen 
we might think of as Environmental Health and Safety kind of re-
search but it would never be classified as such because you actually 
have  to  do  it  to  make  the  stuff  work.  This  I  would  argue  that  in 
many  ways  we’re  vastly  underestimating  the  amount  of  money 
that’s  going  into  EH&S-type  work  because  it  accompanies  a  lot  of 
this type of research. 

We  are  faced  with  some  staggering  scientific  and  technological 
problems  today,  ranging  from  energy  and  healthcare  and  the  envi-
ronment,  and  nanotech  solutions  are  virtually  at  the  forefront  of 
every  single  one  of  these  problems.  For  example,  in  my  own  lab, 
we  have  developed  a  technology  that  goes  from  a  finger  prick  of 
blood  to  50  protein  diagnostic  measurements,  all  within  the  time 
scale that’s actually faster than the blood clotting. 

Now  that  we’re  beginning  to  harness  that  technology  for  use  in 
our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq but we’re also using it within 
our cancer center. In Afghanistan and Iraq, there’s many instances 
where  this  technology  can  be  utilized  to  help  dramatically  shorten 
the  time  between  diagnosis  and  treatment  after  trauma.  The  ther-
apy can help save lives. This is an emerging and really interesting 
issue. I hope someone asks me about it. 

Now  is  not  the  time  to  further  regulate  this  field.  The  thera-
peutics  and  the  diagnostic  devices  that  I’ve  just  talked  about  go 
through very demanding procedures, the same FDA approval proce-
dures  that  anything  else  goes  through,  and  these  procedures  are 
the gold standard. They work. 

The NSF and the NIH have both taken very seriously the aspects 
of the health impact of nanotech and they’ve launched major initia-
tives  in  these  areas.  However,  the  example  of  a  nano  drug  vastly 
reducing side effects, not increasing them, has been the story when 
the  foresight  and  the  resources  are  available  to  ensure  that  the 
science is done correctly. Right now that part is working. 

I want to conclude with what I think is probably a looming crisis. 
In  fact,  I  know  it’s  a  looming  crisis.  I  was  recently  at  a  meeting 
where a bunch of experts were bemoaning the fact that drug trials, 
clinical trials of drugs are now becoming an offshore endeavor. 

Well,  I’m  here  to  tell  you  that  every  aspect  of  that  process,  from 
the  basic  science  to  the  engineering  to  the  product  testing  to  the 
manufacturing  is  becoming  an  offshore  endeavor.  This  is  not  just 
for drugs, but for many fields. 

We  are  in  serious  danger  of  losing  our  competitive  advantage  in 
a number of high-tech arenas. We achieve world scientific and tech-
nological  leadership  by  taking  on  high-risk,  high  pay-off  goals  and 
sticking  with  those  goals.  However,  our  scientific  enterprise,  I  be-
lieve, is becoming risk-averse.

Other  countries  see  this  chink  in  our  armor  and  are  challenging 
us.  The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  constitutes  one  of  our 
high-risk,  high-yield  investments  and  it’s  working,  but  in  other 
areas, we are losing our edge. 

I  think  our  great  country  has  a  history  of  achieving  its  goals  by 
combining  bold  scientific  visions,  strong  political  leadership,  effec-
tive  public  education  and  significant  and  sustained  investment  in 
our  scientific  foundation.  Through  that,  we  have  maintained  our 
global  technological  and  economic  leadership.  I  think  finding  ways 
to sustain that mix rather than finding ways to regulate an emerg-
ing and fragile field should be the focus of this debate. 

Thank you. 
[The prepared statement of Dr. Heath follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JIM HEATH,  ELIZABETH W.  GILLOON PROFESSOR 
AND PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY;  DIRECTOR,  NANOSYSTEMS BIOLOGY CANCER 
CENTER, CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 
Senator Kerry, Members of the Committee, and Colleagues: 
Nearly a decade ago the late Rick Smalley sat before a Senate committee that was 
considering  the  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative.  Rick  won  the  1996  Nobel  Prize 
in  Chemistry  for  his  part  in  the  discovery  of  C60 and  the  fullerenes.  I  also  had  a 
part  in  that—it  was  my  dissertation  work,  and  Rick  was  my  Ph.D.  advisor.  Thus, 
it  is  a  special  honor  to  be  testifying  here  today,  and  I  want  to  recall  a  bit  of  Rick’s 
testimony from a decade ago. 

‘‘I  sit  before  you  today  with  very  little  hair  on  my  head  . . .  a  result  of  chemo-
therapy  . . .  I’m  not  complaining.  Twenty  years  ago  . . .  I  would  already  be 
dead.  But  twenty  years  from  now  . . .  we  will  no  longer  have  to  use  this  blunt 
tool.  . . .  Nanotechnology  will  have  given  us  . . .  engineered  drugs  which  are 
nanoscale  cancer-seeking  missiles,  a  molecular  technology  that  specifically  tar-
gets  just  the  . . .  cancer  cells  . . .,  and  leaves  everything  else  blissfully  alone 
. . . I may not live to see it, but . . . I am confident it will happen.’’ 1 

Rick was prophetic on both accounts. He didn’t live to see such advances, but they 
are  happening  now.  One  example  comes  from  my  Caltech  colleague,  Mark  Davis. 
Mark is a member of a cancer center that I direct. It is one of a few innovative can-
cer  centers  that  the  NCI  funded  a  few  years  ago  to  develop  nanotechnology  tools 
for  battling  cancer.2 Mark’s  lab  developed  a  nanotherapeutic  that  begins  to  mimic 
Rick’s  nanoscale  cancer-seeking  missiles.3 I’ll  begin  with  a  story  about  a  patient 
from a Phase I clinical trial of this drug. Phase I trials are a last recourse for those 
who  have  failed  everything  else,  and  this  patient  came  to  Mark’s  trial  with  late- 
stage,  metastatic  pancreatic  cancer,  and  a  prognosis  of  2–3  months  left  to  live. 
There  are  several  cancer  survivors  in  this  room.  However,  if  any  of  you  had  had 
metastatic  pancreatic  cancer,  it  is  unlikely  you  would  be  here  today.  The  survival 
rate  for  this  terrible  disease  is  almost  zero.  That  patient  entered  the  trial  almost 
2 years ago, and is still alive, cancer free, and went through the entire trial without 
even  hair  loss.  That  is  a  stunning  result—the  drug  itself  was  a  typical 
chemotherapeutic with toxic side effects that range in severity from hair loss to car-
diac arrest. However, the delivery agent, which was a nanotechnology, permitted the 
dose  to  be  lowered  20-fold,  and  directed  more  effective  drug  delivery  to  the  cancer. 
The scientific foundation for this drug is what the national nanotechnology initia-
tive  has  delivered.  Each  of  Mark’s  nanoparticles  is  designed  to  look  friendly  to  the 
immune  system,  to  stay  in  the  blood  for  days  until  they  find  the  tumor,  and  to  not 
release their drug payload until they are inside a cancer cell. 

This is just the beginning.

We  are  faced  with  some  staggering  scientific  challenges  today—ranging  from  en-
ergy  to  health  care  to  the  environment.  For  virtually  all  of  these  problems,  nano-
technology-enabled solutions are at the forefront of the scientific search for answers. 
In  my  lab  we  have  developed  a  nanotechnology-enabled  chip  that  carries  out  al-
most  50  diagnostic  measurements  from  a  fingerprick  of  blood—all  before  the  blood 
even  clots.4 This  chip  has  applications  for  our  soldiers  in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan 
where shortening the time between injury, diagnosis, and treatment can save lives. 
It also has applications to routine health care. 

Now  is  not  the  time  to  further  regulate  this  field.  Mark’s  therapeutics  and  our 
diagnostic  devices  go  through  the  same  demanding  FDA  approval  processes  as 
standard drugs and health care technologies—that process sets the global standard, 
and it works. 

The  NSF  and  the  NIH  are  taking  seriously  the  tasks  of  understanding  the  envi-
ronmental  and  health  impacts  of  nanotechnologies—both  agencies  have  established 
significant programs to understand those risks. 

However—the  example  of  a  nanodrug  vastly  reducing  toxic  side  effects—not  in-
creasing  them,  has  been  the  story  when  the  foresight  and  resources  are  available 
to ensure that the science is done correctly. Right now, that part is working. 

Finally, I want to turn to a looming crisis. I was recently at a meeting where var-
ious  experts  were  bemoaning  the  fact  that  clinical  drug  trials  are  increasingly  off-
shore  endeavors.  In  fact,  the  entire  process,  from  the  basic  science  of  discovery,  to 
engineering,  product  testing,  and  manufacturing,  is  moving  off  shore—and  not  just 
for drug discovery. We are in serious danger of losing our competitive advantage in 
a  number  of  high  tech  arenas.  We  achieve  world  scientific  &  technological  leader-
ship  by  taking  on  high  risk,  high  payoff  goals,  and  sticking  with  those  goals.  How-
ever, our scientific enterprise is becoming risk averse. Other countries see this chink 
in  our  armor,  and  are  challenging  us.  The  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative  con-
stitutes  one  of  our  high  risk/high  yield  investments.  It  is  clearly  working,  although 
it is a serious struggle to stay ahead of the curve. In other areas, we are losing our 
edge. 

Our great country has a history of achieving goals by combining bold scientific vi-
sion,  strong  political  leadership,  effective  public  education,  and  significant  and  sus-
tained investment in our scientific foundation. That is how we have maintained our 
global  technological  and  economic  leadership.  Finding  ways  to  sustain  that  mix, 
rather  than  finding  ways  to  regulate  an  emerging  and  fragile  field,  should  be  the 
focus of this debate. 

Thank you. 

Senator  KERRY.  Thank  you  very  much,  Doctor.  That  was  a  very 

interesting, provocative, and thoughtful testimony. 

Let  me  ask  you.  When  you  suggest,  as  you  did,  that  we  should 
not, I think you used the word ‘‘interfere,’’ am I correct, and there-
fore  not  interrupt  this  chain  of  important  research  which  you’re 
doing  and  it  is  important  and  I  understand  that,  how  do  you  re-
spond to the other testimony and to others who are suggesting that 
we don’t know what some of the impacts of these nanoparticles are 
and  some  of  the  uses  that  are  out  there?  How  do  you  balance  this 
non-interference  and  obvious  need  to  be  competitive  and  move 
down  the  road  with  need  of  the  rights,  the  public’s  right  to  know, 
and adequate protection for the public against the product like that 
where  you  may  be  brushing  your  teeth  with  something  that  you 
learn in 10 years actually does you great harm? 

Dr.  HEATH.  Well,  I  would  argue  that  the  vast  amount  of  nano-
technology  that’s  investigated  today  is  done  on  a  very  small  scale 
in  the  lab  where  we’ve  never  gone  in  and  interfered  with  the 
science and it’s probably not appropriate to do so because that’s not 
a place where it’s going to have an impact.

Whenever any of these technologies actually make it out into the 
commercial  arena,  the  very  nature  of  that  process  mandates  that 
these things are investigated very thoroughly. thoroughly. I can tell 
you  mostly  from  the  healthcare  arena  that  it’s  a  demanding  proc-
ess.  I  was  a  meeting  where  a  bunch  of  people  doing  nanotech  are 
staggered by these regulations. 

Senator KERRY. Staggered by? 
Dr. HEATH. By the regulations of trying to—it’s what every drug 

has to do to go through FDA or—— 

Senator  KERRY.  You’re  talking  about  a  drug  and  drugs  indeed 
have  a  certain  protocol  and  a  higher  standard.  What  about  other 
products  that  come  into  the  market?  I  mean  obviously  this  tooth-
paste doesn’t. 

Dr. HEATH. Right. 
Senator KERRY. There are countless other products. My wife and 
I just wrote a book, she wrote the chapter on toxins and, you’ve got 
these  extraordinary  numbers  of  toxins  that  are  in  products  that 
people aren’t even aware of. Whether it’s phthalates in plastic that 
we  now  know  is  carcinogenic,  bisphenol,  or  other  things  that  kids 
suck on and are in toys or elsewhere, and people really don’t know 
the consequences. 

Dr.  HEATH.  Well,  I  think  that  we  have  some  issues  in  terms  of 
products  that  get  released  that  we  don’t  have  very  much  oversight 
on.  I  don’t  think  that’s  a  nanotechnology  problem.  I  think  if  you 
compared what happens in the cosmetic industry where people are 
applying all kinds of things to the body,—— 

Senator KERRY. That’s crazy. 
Dr.  HEATH.—you  don’t  have  near  the  amount  of  oversight  over 

that industry. Nanotech is—— 

Senator KERRY. We actually have none. 
Dr.  HEATH.  Yes.  That’s  right.  If  we  single  out  nanotech,  right 
now  it’s  a  very  fragile  field.  It’s  young.  I  know  we  talked  about 
these major things going into products. 

Senator KERRY. Well, wouldn’t you say—— 
Dr. HEATH. It’s small potatoes. 
Senator  KERRY.  When  you  say  single  it  out,  I’m  not  sure  we’re 
singling  it  out,  but  given  its  potential  to  be  in  so  many  different 
products and the extraordinary power within the marketplace that 
it  may  well  have,  doesn’t  it  behoove  us  to  try  to  get  this  right  up-
front? 

Dr. HEATH. Absolutely, and I would say just like—you know, sev-
eral  years  ago,  when  the  AIDS  crisis  hit,  our  knowledge  of  the 
human immune system went up dramatically because of that crisis. 
At  the  moment,  because  of  National  Nanotechnology  Initiative, 
we  know  a  tremendous  amount  of  what  nanotechnology  matters 
and materials and et. cetera do inside the human body and the en-
vironment that we never would have known otherwise. 

I think we’re learning this and we haven’t had a uniform way to 
maybe  categorize  it,  although  I  believe  there  are  some  agencies 
that are beginning to do that, but if we made a regulation now, it’d 
be based upon ignorance, I believe. But I do believe it’s a good time 
to try to begin categorizing it in a rational way. 

Senator KERRY. I mean what if the regulation is a reaction to ig-
norance  in  a  sense  in  that  it  is  requiring  a  certain  protocol  to  be 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:11 May 24, 2012 Jkt 074321 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\74321.TXT SCOM1 PsN: JACKIE

followed before X, Y or Z product is placed out there? Is that so on-
erous? 

Dr. HEATH. No. In fact, I think that’s done now. 
Senator  KERRY.  Should  we  demand  a  transparent  protocol  by 

which something is coming to the market? 

Dr. HEATH. At least in all the commercial endeavors I’ve been in-
volved in, that is exactly what happens now because of the current 
standards and practices. 

Senator  KERRY.  Except  for  those  75,000.  I  think  we  only  have 
6,000 FDA-approved chemicals that are out in the marketplace out 
of  some  82,000  that  I  know  are  ‘‘out  in  the  marketplace,’’  some  of 
them  to  a  lesser  or  greater  degree  than  others,  obviously.  Cos-
metics  is  an  example  where  estrogenic  substances  have  been  used 
in  some  of  these  products  which  wind  up  in  fact  potentially  giving 
people cancer. 

Hair  straighteners,  for  instance,  have  been  shown  to  be  particu-
larly  malicious  among  African  American  young  women  who  wind 
up  with  a  greater  incidence  of  breast  cancer  and  other  things.  No-
body has done a complete linkage, but there’s a lot of evidence now 
about  endocrine  disruptors  and  other  impacts  out  there.  Books  are 
being  written  by  researchers,  oncologists,  and  others  that  are  all 
looking at this. 

It  seems  to  me  the  warning  signs  are  flashing  and  we  ought  to 

just be careful. That’s all. Nobody wants to interfere. 

Anybody else want to respond to this? Yes, Dr. Goel? 
Dr.  GOEL.  Yes.  I  would  like  to  add  that  I  think  that  it’s  not  a 
matter  of  whether  to  apply  regulations  or  not,  it’s  about  where  to 
apply the regulations and when to apply them. 

I think what Dr. Heath said at the level of the basic science inno-
vation,  that’s  probably  not  the  best  place  to  apply  the  restrictions. 
Senator  KERRY.  Are  we  trying  to?  Is  anybody  trying  to  apply  it 

there? 

Dr. GOEL. I think that the hype that gets created about the nega-
tive  aspects  of  nanotechnology  may  tend  to  discourage  certain 
kinds  of  funding  to  basic  science  nanotechnology  which  could  have 
an adverse effect. 

Senator KERRY. So we should be wary of that and wary of inter-

fering at the basic level, correct? 

Dr. GOEL. In terms of a mentality. I think the other thing is one 
must  be  clear  that  not  all  kinds  of  nanotechnology  are  this  gen-
eral—the same kind of bad consequence. Maybe you’re referring to 
nanomaterials  or  nanochemicals.  Nanotechnology  is  broader  than 
that. 

Senator KERRY. Agreed. 
Dr.  GOEL.  And  what  it  defines  and  refers  to  is  much  broader 
than that and so I think it’s a very narrow projection of what nano-
technology is. 

Senator KERRY. How would you define it? 
Dr. GOEL. Nanotechnology? 
Senator KERRY. Yes. 
Dr. GOEL. I love to define it. 
Senator KERRY. What? 
Dr. GOEL. In my mind, it really is the ability to probe and control 
matter  at  increasingly  finer  scales,  10  to  the  minus  9  meters  and

beyond and smaller, and why that’s important is because when we 
can  learn  to  control  and  manipulate  matter  and  probe  matter  on 
that  level,  we  can  effect  the  properties  of  systems  and  nanomate-
rials is one example. 

In  our  example,  we  control  the  molecules  which  improves  the 

precision and accuracy with which we can read out information. 

Senator  KERRY.  Where  are  you  in  that  process?  Do  you  actually 

have an ability to—— 

Dr. GOEL. We have a prototype. 
Senator KERRY. A prototype? 
Dr. GOEL. Yes. 
Senator KERRY. Which is bigger than what you’re holding in your 

hand? 

here. 

Dr. GOEL. No, this is the chip. 
Senator KERRY. That’s the prototype chip? 
Dr. GOEL. Yes. 
Senator KERRY. What’s the read-out? 
Dr.  GOEL.  The  read-out  is  bigger  than  our  Blackberry  I  show 

Senator KERRY. So that is yet to come? 
Dr. GOEL. Yes, exactly. 
Senator KERRY. Dr. Ferguson. 
Dr. FERGUSON. Yes, I would comment—— 
Senator  KERRY.  Let  me  just  give  you  all  a  heads  up.  I  have  a 
meeting  I’ve  got  to  run  to  before  too  long.  So  I  may  have  to  trun-
cate this a bit but we’ll try to keep going. 

Dr.  FERGUSON.  Senator  Kerry,  I  would  say  that  the  examples 
that  Dr.  Heath  highlighted  about  biomedically  relevant  nanopar-
ticles  certainly  would  be  well  understood  by  the  time  they  get  to 
the  point  they’d  be  used  in  biomedicine  from  lots  of  study  by  the 
FDA and the developers, but I would say that your example of, for 
example,  at  Tuskalis  with  75,000  compounds  that  are  out  there  in 
our environment is a great example of why we should be spending 
the  effort  upfront  right  now  to  study  and  understand  at  the  sci-
entific level the behavior in both environmental systems as well as 
biological systems of as broad a range of nanomaterials as possible. 
The  big  problem  here  is  that  for  nanotechnology,  we’re  really 
talking  about  a  very,  very  broad  scientific  field  that  encompasses 
lots  of  different  materials  with  different  chemistries  and  different 
surface  properties  and  so  it’s  very  difficult  to  say  whether  nano-
technology,  nanomaterials  in  general  are  dangerous,  are  not  dan-
gerous, are safe or not safe. 

Senator  KERRY.  Well,  let’s  come  back  to  the  panel’s  original  dis-
cussion  then.  Does  that  say  something  about  what  ought  to  be  re-
quired  in  terms  of  a  strategy  or  roadmap?  Where  do  you  all  come 
out on that? 

Dr. FERGUSON. I think that’s essential. I think that there should 
be  some  rational  prioritization  of  the  types  of  nanomaterials  and 
the types of nanotechnologies that are assessed in terms of environ-
mental and human health safety and so I think of this as a chemist 
and the ideal would be to come up with models that we can fit new 
nanomaterials  into  as  they  become  available  where  we  have  some 
applicable—some idea of how these new materials will behave with 
reference to materials we’ve studied in the past.

That’s the best way, I think, to leverage our scientific knowledge. 
Senator KERRY. Mr. Rejeski. 
Mr. REJESKI. I think one of the most important things we can ac-
tually  do  is  provide  adequate  resources  to  some  of  these  agencies 
that  provide  oversight.  I  mean  the  FDA  an  incredibly  powerful 
brand for people that are trying to bring products into the market. 
The FDA’s own science board just did a fairly extensive examina-
tion of their capacities and one of the things they said was the de-
velopment  of  new  medical  products  based  on  what  they  said  was 
new  science,  which  would  include  genomics  nanotech,  cannot  be 
adequately regulated by the FDA at this moment. 

I mean, basically, we’ve just witnessed over a hundred deaths on 
an  FDA-approved  product,  a  blood  thinner.  So  I  think,  you  know, 
one of the things that we’re looking at, and it’s a much wider area, 
is just making sure that these agencies, such as the FDA, the Con-
sumer  Product  Safety  Commission,  EPA,  have  the  resources.  They 
are  totally  starved  under  the  NNI  because  60  percent  of  the  envi-
ronmental health and safety research is going to the NSF. 

NSF is a phenomenal agency but NSF will not answer any of the 
questions  that  we’re  going  to  have  to  answer  around  this  product. 
Meanwhile,  all  the  agencies  that  really  are  required  to  provide 
oversight  and  the  science  that’s  behind  oversight  because  we  don’t 
want oversight built on inadequate science are starved, and I think 
that’s part of the strategy that we haven’t gotten right yet and it’s 
critical  now  as  we  move  more  of  these  products,  whether  they’re 
medical applications, whether they’re cosmetic, whatever it is, into 
the commercial realm. 

So I think part of it is actually doing something that we need to 
do  generally  in  the  government  and  obviously  the  Congress  has 
been  holding  hearings  about  consumer  product  safety,  about  the 
EPA,  but  I  think  a  strong  FDA  helps  in  the  long  run  because  the 
entire world cares about the FDA’s clinical trial process. 

Senator  KERRY.  I’m  going  to  come  to  you,  Mr.  Nordan,  in  just  a 
minute,  but  who  was  it,  Dr.  Ferguson  or  Dr.  Goel,  who  mentioned 
the negative hype? That’s what I thought, Dr. Goel. 

It  seems  to  me  the  only  way  to  push  back  against  the  negative 
hype is going to be to do the scientific research and develop a kind 
of  transparent  accountable  understanding  of  the  American  people 
of what they’re dealing with, isn’t it? 

Dr. GOEL. I agree, yes. I think that—— 
Senator KERRY. Can you do that adequately without running into 
the  problem  that  I  think  Dr.  Heath  appropriately  raises,  which  is, 
scaring everybody away and creating such an albatross of a process 
that you reduce innovation? 

Dr. GOEL. I think absolutely. 
Senator KERRY. What’s the key to that? 
Dr. GOEL. The key to that is letting the research happen, remove 
the shackles around the creative research process, let that happen. 

Senator KERRY. Right. 
Dr.  GOEL.  Once  the  research  tries  to,  as  he  said,  get  out  of  the 
lab and go into the marketplace and starts to cross the gamut, then 
bring  in  the  regulatory  thresholds  that  you  would  apply  to  any 
other product. 

Senator KERRY. Does that work for you, Dr. Heath?

Dr.  HEATH.  I  think  if  those  regulatory  bars  you  have  to  jump 

over are carefully thought out, absolutely. 

Senator  KERRY.  But  if  they  come  after  the  initial  research 

steps—— 

Dr.  HEATH.  It’s  kind  of  nice  to  know  what’s  down  the  road  so 

that you, you know, focus your efforts in—— 

Senator KERRY. Was that any different from where you are now? 
Dr.  HEATH.  No,  I  would  say  for  the  drugs—so  let  me  be  very 
clear. I believe for anything that’s nanotherapeutic or drug-related, 
we  have  a  great  process.  We  do  not  need  to  step  into  new  regula-
tions. 

Senator KERRY. Right. 
Dr.  HEATH.  For  other  stuff  that  may  not  be  certain  things  you 
ingest,  it  could  be  a  chemical,  could  be  a  face  powder,  could  be  a 
solar  cell,  we  may  need  to  have  a  certain  level  of  standards  that 
we establish. 

Senator KERRY. Good line to draw. I accept that. Mr. Nordan. 
Mr.  NORDAN.  To  give  some  insight  from  how  the  business  com-
munity  views  this,  we  work  with  a  large  number  of  corporations 
across  a  large  number  of  industries,  from  electronics  through  to 
chemicals and also in life sciences. 

I  would  tell  you  that  we  should  not  conflate  in  this  discussion 
laboratory research and regulation of manufactured goods that are 
manufactured  to  large  scale.  I  don’t  think  there  is  anyone  who  is 
calling for or deeply focused on setting limits, as we’ve seen, for ex-
ample,  with  stem  cell  research,  on  what  scientists  can  and  cannot 
do in the nanoscale regime in the laboratory. 

It’s a very different issue when you come to manufactured goods, 
and I think what’s unique in nanotechnology is that you have both 
large  companies,  like  Dupont,  as  well  as  small  ones,  like  Alta 
Nanotechnologies, that are asking for regulatory clarity. 

Normally  you  think  of  this  as  trying  to  duck  regulations  and 
duck  red  tape  and  in  this  case,  you  have  folks  at  large  chemical 
companies,  electronics  firms,  medical  products  companies  who  are 
simply asking not for new regulations but for regulatory clarity on 
what currently applies. 

A  client  of  ours  that  I  spent  some  time  with  recently,  a  CTO  of 
a  billion  dollar,  multibillion  dollar  chemicals,  multinational  chemi-
cals  company  on  the  East  Coast,  and  sat  down  with  him,  went 
through  some  nanotechnology  research.  We  were  batting  some 
questions  back  and  forth.  He  said,  ‘‘You  know  what,  Matthew?  It’s 
amazing  to  me  that  7  years  after  the  introduction  of  the  National 
Nanotechnology Initiative, I don’t know whether TOSCA applies to 
my products or not.’’ 

You  would  not  suit  up  and  go  into  a  football  game  if  you  didn’t 
know what the rules were and when someone could tackle you and 
businesses  are  very  concerned  about  bringing  products  to  market, 
that  in  some  cases  their  rivals  in  Europe  and  in  East  Asia  are 
doing that well ahead of them, not because they’re concerned about 
the  consequences  of  regulation  but  because  they  don’t  know  what 
the rules of the game are. 

Senator  KERRY.  Fair  enough.  That’s  very  important.  That’s  a 
very important view obviously for us to factor in as we think about 
this.

How  about  the  foreign  competition  piece?  Will  this  work  if  we 
have  a  fairly  commonsensical  but  nevertheless  accountable  and 
transparent system but the Chinese don’t? 

Mr.  NORDAN.  Well,  if  I  could  take  a  shot  at  that,  I  think  that 
there are places in the world where there are straightforward com-
monsense mechanisms that might be considered more onerous than 
the  United  States  where  there  is  actually  much  more  active  nano-
technology  research  and  development,  at  least  on  behalf  of  large 
corporations. 

We normally think of Europe as being a generally more cautious 
and  more  precautionary  group  of  societies  when  it  comes  to  new 
chemicals, new materials. Regulations like REACH, for example, is 
a very broad-ranging chemical regulation in the EU or an example 
of  that.  Yet  when  you  compare  the  Dows  and  Duponts  and  GE 
Plastics  of  the  world  with  their  rivals  in  Europe,  companies  like 
Salve  and  BASF  and  DSM,  you  actually  find  that  the  European 
companies have been much more aggressive in conducting research 
on  nanoparticles  and  being  very  straightforward  and  transparent 
with  the  public  on  how  they’re  being  used  and  launching  products 
that  are  actively  pitched  for  their  nanobenefits,  nanobenefits,  and 
I think that comes down to regulatory clarity. 

I don’t think there is an incompatibility between straightforward 
common  sense  application  of  regulatory  regimes  and  aggressive 
commercial activity in nanotech. I think the European example ar-
gues that they can come together. 

Senator KERRY. Well, folks, regrettably, I’ve got to be over in the 
Capitol  for  a  briefing  on  Syria  and  North  Korea  and  what’s  going 
on.  I  apologize  for  breaking  up,  but  as  I  said,  I’ll  leave  the  record 
open. 

I appreciate all of you coming here. This is really very, very help-
ful.  We  obviously  want  to  get  this  thing  reauthorized  and  do  this 
well and if you have further thoughts you would like to share with 
the  Committee,  the  record  is  open.  We  welcome  your  further  com-
ments  based  on  what  you’ve  heard  today  or  if  you  think  you’d  like 
to extrapolate a little bit, we’d welcome that. 

It’s  an  interesting  topic.  I  regret  more  people  weren’t  able  to  be 
here, but Thursday afternoon, having just had our last vote sort of 
affects  what  happens  here  a  little  bit,  I  apologize  for  that.  Every-
body has pretty intensive schedules. 

But  this  is  a  topic  everybody  is  intrigued  by  and  learning  more 
about.  We’ve  clearly  learned  around  here  to  try  as  hard  as  we  can 
not  to  get  in  the  way  and  I  think  we’re  getting  better  at  that,  not 
to overreach but to come up with something that’s really thoughtful 
and  workable.  We’ll  do  our  best  here  to  be  able  to  try  to  do  that 
because we want this sector to flourish. 

I’m convinced that this, together with a few other things, like ar-
tificial  intelligence,  robotics  and  communications  and  so  forth,  are 
the  future  for  us  in  terms  of  high  value-added  jobs  and  technology 
advances and so forth, life sciences obviously, bio, but this is a big 
deal for us. 

So we want to try to get it right and I hope you’ll help us do that. 

You certainly have to a great degree today. 

So  all  the  way  from  California  and  elsewhere,  thanks  so  much 

for coming in. We really appreciate it.
