HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Implementing the Vision for Space
Exploration: Development of the

Crew Exploration Vehicle

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2006

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Thursday,  September  28th  at  2:00  p.m.  the  House  Committee  on  Science  will
hold  a  hearing  to  review  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration’s  ef-
forts  to  develop  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV),  which  NASA  has  recently  an-
nounced  will  be  called  Orion.  As  laid  out  in  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration, Orion will carry humans to the International Space Station (ISS), the Moon,
and beyond following the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2010. On August 31st,
2006,  NASA  selected  Lockheed  Martin  as  its  industry  partner  for  the  development
and  production  of  Orion,  signing  a  development  and  production  contract  worth,  in-
cluding all options, approximately $8.1 billion through 2019.

On  Wednesday  the  26th  of  July,  the  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  re-
leased a report critical of NASA’s contracting approach for the acquisition of Orion.
The report, entitled ‘‘NASA: Long-Term Commitment to and Investment in Space Ex-
ploration  Program  Requires  More  Knowledge,’’  faults  the  Agency  for  committing  to
a long-term contract for Orion before reaching an appropriate level of understanding
of  the  design  and  risks  of  the  program.  The  GAO  report  says,  ‘‘NASA’s  current  ac-
quisition strategy for the CEV places the project at risk of significant cost overruns,
schedule  delays  and  performance  shortfalls  because  it  commits  the  government  to
a  long-term  product  development  effort  before  establishing  a  sound  business  case.’’
Following  discussions  with  the  GAO  and  the  Science  Committee,  NASA  revised
its  then  pending  contract  with  Lockheed  Martin  to  address  some  of  the  GAO’s  con-
cerns.

NASA and Lockheed Martin have now started work under the Orion contract and
expect  to  complete  development  by  2014  with  a  first  demonstration  flight  occurring
in  2013.  Overall,  NASA  will  be  depending  in  part  on  the  skills  and  knowledge  in
the  contractor  community  to  reach  a  final  design  for  Orion.  GAO  argues  that  this
design  activity  should  be  separated  from  longer-term  production,  allowing  the  gov-
ernment  to  have  greater  leverage  to  seek  beneficial  production  terms.  NASA,  how-
ever,  has  chosen  to  include  the  entire  design  and  production  of  Orion  into  one  con-
tract  with  the  hopes  that  this  will  help  control  total  life  cycle  costs.  This  hearing
will explore NASA’s development schedule and costs and provide a basis for ongoing
oversight of this program.

sion Directorate, NASA

countability Office

Overarching Questions

1) What is NASA’s strategy for developing Orion?
2) Does  NASA  have  the  knowledge  required  to  enter  into  a  long-term  develop-

ment contract?

3) What  steps  can  NASA  take  to  ensure  timely  and  cost-effective  development

of Orion?

Background

4

Following  President  Bush’s  January  14th,  2004  announcement  of  the  Vision  for
Space  Exploration,  NASA  began  a  number  of  studies  to  determine  how  the  Agency
could  implement  the  new  direction  laid  out  in  the  President’s  speech.  The  agency
announced the results of its Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) in Sep-
tember, 2005 and has continued to refine this approach to date.

NASA  has  presented  a  plan  designed  to  enable  a  crew  of  four  to  land  anywhere
on  the  Moon,  stay  for  up  to  seven  days  initially,  and  abort  and  return  to  Earth  at
anytime.  To  enable  this  mission  concept,  NASA  has  chosen  to  separate  crew  and
cargo using two new launch vehicles. Crew will travel aboard the Crew Exploration
Vehicle,  now  called  Orion,  a  capsule  capable  of  supporting  a  crew  of  four  to  six.
Orion will initially transport crew to the International Space Station and will even-
tually ferry astronauts to the Moon and back. This design will include a launch es-
cape system that should allow the crew to safely abort in the event of a launch fail-
ure. NASA argues that this design has a safety factor many times higher than that
of  the  current  Space  Shuttle.  The  capsule  will  launch  on  top  of  a  new  launch  vehi-
cle, previously described as the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), and which has recently
been named the Ares I. This launch vehicle will use the Space Shuttle’s Solid Rocket
Booster (SRB) as an initial stage and an upper stage utilizing an Apollo derived en-
gine,  the  J–2X.  After  Orion  and  Ares  I  have  been  developed,  NASA  plans  to  begin
work  on  a  new  heavy-lift  launch  vehicle  of  a  capacity  slightly  greater  than  that  of
the Saturn V. This vehicle, the Ares V, would launch the equipment needed to land
on  the  Moon—equipment  the  CEV  would  link  up  with  in  low-Earth  orbit.  Ares  V
will  utilize  two  Space  Shuttle  SRBs  and  five  engines  from  the  Boeing  Delta  IV,  on
an  external  tank  similar  to  Shuttle’s.  NASA  is  calling  the  overall  program  for  the
development  of  Orion,  Ares  I  and  V,  and  future  lunar  activities  the  Constellation
Systems program.
Issues
What has NASA committed to in the Orion development contract with Lockheed Mar-

tin?

Lockheed  Martin  was  selected  for  the  Orion  contract  on  August  31,  winning  out
over a partnership between Northrup Grumman and Boeing. The Lockheed contract
is  expected  to  cost  about  $3.9  billion  for  development  and  testing  of  two  test  flight
capsules;  it  is  a  cost-plus  contract  so  the  exact  figure  cannot  yet  be  known.  The
signed  contract  also  includes  two  additional  options,  named  Schedules  B  and  C,
under  which  NASA  would  contract  with  Lockheed  to  produce  the  operational  vehi-
cles.  Schedules  B  and  C  include  price  ceilings  for  the  vehicles  and  associated  sup-
port  services.  The  contract  value  of  the  options  totals  approximately  $4.25  billion
through 2019 assuming a schedule of five flights per year.

Initially,  the  contract  did  not  make  clear  that  Schedules  B  and  C  were  options
and  that  therefore  the  government  could  end  the  contract  prior  to  production  of
operational vehicles without penalty. As a result of the GAO study, the contract lan-
guage was changed so that it is now clear that Schedules B and C are options.

Why was Lockheed Martin chosen?

Selection  documents  show  that  NASA  judged  Lockheed  Martin’s  bid  superior

based on cost, technical approach, and past performance.

Does NASA have the knowledge needed to sign a long-term contract?

GAO’s  first  concern  is  the  Agency’s  approach  of  committing  to  a  long-term  con-
tract for Orion before completing design work and developing a firmer cost estimate.
GAO  fears  that  committing  now  to  a  long-term  development  contract  could  raise
costs as design changes are worked out.

Responding to the GAO report, NASA argues that it has a good sense of how the
project  will  proceed  because  it  is  largely  based  on  existing  technology  developed  for
the Apollo or Shuttle programs. Also, NASA points out that two teams of NASA em-
ployees  conducted  design  studies  independent  of  the  contractor  (and  of  the  NASA
teams  was  independent  of  the  Constellation  program).  NASA  also  believes  that
making  clear  that  Schedules  B  and  C  are  merely  options  has  also  reduced  the  risk
of cost overruns.

NASA  also  has  included  explicit  milestones  for  the  contractor  to  meet  and  given
the  government  the  ability  to  terminate  the  contract  if  the  project  is  not  meeting
NASA’s requirements.

GAO, in turn, points out that space projects in general, and NASA’s in particular
do  not  have  a  good  record  of  coming  in  within  expected  costs.  GAO  also  points  out
that  NASA  still  does  not  have  a  final  design  or  cost  estimate  for  Orion  or  Ares  I.

NASA  has  just  begun  the  detailed  design  work  necessary  before  production  of  the
first  test  units.  NASA  expects  to  have  preliminary  designs  completed  by  summer
2008 and final designs by spring 2010.

Why has NASA chosen a long-term contract?

NASA says it requires industry expertise to complete the design and development
of  Orion.  While  NASA  is  engaging  all  of  its  centers  in  the  development  projects
within Constellation, the Agency says it does not have sufficient personnel in critical
areas to complete the designs in-house.

GAO  recommended  that  NASA  could  mitigate  its  contract  risk  without  delaying
the  project  by  moving  forward  with  a  contract  to  carry  the  program  only  through
its  design  phase  to  the  Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR)  milestone,  scheduled  for
summer  2008.  During  the  PDR,  NASA  will  verify  that  the  designs  for  Orion  meet
all  of  the  requirements  for  the  system.  At  PDR,  NASA  (and  industry)  will  have  a
much  better  understanding  of  the  program  and  be  in  a  stronger  position  to  make
firm  commitments  to  cost  and  schedule  for  the  development.  NASA,  however,  has
chosen to include the entire design and development of Orion into one contract with
the expectation that this will help control total life cycle costs because, among other
reasons, it removes the incentive to push off expenses to later stages of the contract.

What are the technical challenges that face the Constellation Program?

NASA believes that there are no areas in the Orion concept where the technology
is immature and poses significant development risks. When pressed, NASA officials
have  said  the  hardest  aspect  of  the  project  will  be  ‘‘systems  integration’’—enabling
elements that were originally designed for other vehicles to work together. In addi-
tion,  NASA  has  begun  focused  efforts  on  technology  areas  that  are  currently  per-
ceived  to  hold  the  most  risk,  including  efforts  to  address  early  risks  in  the  thermal
protection  and  landing  systems.  However,  given  the  early  stage  of  development  of
the project, the risks for the overall program are not clear. For the next year, NASA
and  Lockheed  Martin  will  work  to  complete  a  set  of  well-defined  requirements,  a
preliminary design, and firm cost estimates.

What is the likelihood of further technical changes to Orion?

As  GAO  notes  in  its  report,  NASA  has  made  a  number  of  significant  changes  to
the  Exploration  Systems  architecture  since  its  announcement  in  September  2005.
These include decreasing the diameter of Orion from 5.5 meters to five meters, mov-
ing from use of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) to an Apollo-derived engine,
the J–2X, on the Ares I, and moving to the Delta IV engine on the Ares V. Further
changes  are  expected,  particularly  as  engine  testing  determines  exactly  how  much
weight the engines are capable of lifting.

What is the development timeframe for Orion and Ares I?

The  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  directs  NASA  to  launch  Orion  as  close  to
2010 as possible to minimize the time between the last Shuttle launch and the first
launch of Orion. NASA had hoped to have Orion launch by 2012—two years earlier
than  initially  planned—but  has  not  concluded  that  it  will  not  have  the  funding  to
accomplish that.

Orion and Ares I are currently in the early stages of development. Significant de-
sign  and  development  activities  remain  for  both  projects,  including  finalizing  top-
level requirements and drafting detailed engineering designs. This fall, both vehicles
will  begin  System  Requirement  Reviews  that  will  finalize  the  basic  parameters  of
the  system.  Preliminary  design  work  will  be  reviewed  during  the  summer  of  2008,
with  final  reviews  before  commencing  production  occurring  during  the  spring  of
2010.  NASA  expects  to  complete  a  preliminary  test  of  the  first  stage  of  Ares  I  in
late 2009. Operational tests of the full system will not occur until fall of 2013.

What are the projected costs for Constellation development?

Due to the uncertainty inherent in estimating costs for development of new prod-
ucts, NASA develops a cost range based on past performance and cost models. Tra-
ditionally  NASA  has  budgeted  for  new  developments  at  a  confidence  of  50  percent,
meaning  that  the  project  stood  an  equal  chance  of  having  an  actual  cost  above  or
below the estimate. A higher confidence levels reflects a greater chance of the actual
cost  of  a  project  coming  in  under  the  estimate.  There  is  an  ongoing  debate  within
the  space  community  about  the  appropriate  confidence  level  for  space  acquisitions,
with  many  critics  suggesting  the  need  for  higher  confidence  levels.  The  Air  Force
has recently switched to a policy of requiring estimates at the 80 percent level.

NASA  predicts  the  Orion  development  effort  will  cost  $18.3  billion  from  2006  to
2020  at  65  percent  confidence  including  both  contractor  and  government  costs.  In
the  near-term,  NASA  predicts  that  the  cost  of  the  Constellation  program  through
2011,  when  NASA  would  begin  testing  Orion  and  Ares  I,  is  $32.1  billion  with  80
percent  confidence.  Finally,  NASA  believes  that  the  cost  of  returning  to  the  Moon
by  2018  may  be  around  $104  billion,  but  NASA  has  not  yet  performed  a  detailed
analysis of this cost. GAO estimates the total Constellation costs through 2018 total
$122  billion.  For  Constellation,  most  of  the  development  risk  lies  beyond  the  2012
timeframe, when NASA begins work on the various craft needed to support a lunar
mission.

GAO  notes  that  the  FY  2007  budget  does  not  fully  support  the  costs  laid  out  in
the original Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), completed last summer.
GAO estimates that NASA does not have sufficient funding budgeted to support the
architecture  during  FY  2008,  2009,  and  2010.  However,  NASA’s  approach  to  imple-
menting  the  exploration  architecture  has  evolved  significantly  since  the  ESAS  re-
port making it difficult to determine what shortfall may occur. NASA has continued
to  refine  its  cost  estimates  internally,  but  has  embargoed  that  information  pending
the release of the FY 2008 budget.

What  implications  would  cost  growth  in  Constellation  have  for  other  programs  at

NASA?

As  noted  by  GAO,  it  is  unclear  if  NASA  has  the  budget  to  support  the  Vision  as
laid out in ESAS. NASA has announced its intention to carry over funds in the Ex-
ploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  from  fiscal  years  2006,  2007,  and  2008  to
cover  the  expected  large  costs  in  2009  and  2010.  NASA  expects  to  shift  resources
away  from  the  Shuttle  program  after  its  retirement  to  Constellation.  Despite  these
resources, the Agency remains challenged to support development of Orion by 2014.
NASA  has  stated  that  it  will  pursue  a  lunar  return  program  under  a  philosophy  of
‘‘go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay.’’ Specifically:

NASA’s  plan  is  to  contain  [CEV]  costs  within  the  human  space  flight  budget,
thereby, impacting the content of other projects and programs within that budg-
et.  Thus,  a  higher  than  expected  CEV  cost  would  simply  delay  CEV  develop-
ment  or  production  or  impact  other  programs  and  projects  within  that  human
space  flight  budget  category.  NASA  continues  its  ‘go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay’
strategy toward all of our missions of space exploration, scientific discovery, and
aeronautics research.

The  Authorization  Act  requires  NASA  to  balance  its  human  space  flight,  space

science, Earth science, and aeronautics programs.

Witness Questions

The  witnesses  were  asked  to  address  the  following  questions  in  their  testimony:

Dr. Scott Horowitz

1. What is NASA’s strategy for reducing the total cost for production and oper-

ation of the CEV?

2. What  actions  has  NASA  taken  to  address  the  concerns  raised  in  the  GAO
report entitled ‘‘NASA: Long-Term Commitment to and Investment in Space
Exploration Program Requires More Knowledge’’?

Mr. Allen Li

1. To what degree does NASA’s approach deviate from ‘‘best practices’’ for large

system acquisitions?

2. NASA  has  claimed  that  implementing  the  GAO’s  recommendations  would
delay  the  delivery  of  the  CEV  and  increase  costs.  Please  explain  why  you
agree or disagree with NASA’s claim.

3. Does  NASA  have  the  financial  resources  necessary  to  complete  the  adopted

NASA Report on Cost Estimates for the

Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Other

Agency Program Budgets through 2020

JUNE 2006

This  report  responds  to  the  requirements  of  Section  102  of  the  NASA  Authoriza-
tion Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155) to provide cost and budget information for the Crew
Exploration Vehicle (CEV), as well as other Agency programs through 2020.

The  current  estimate  of  total  nonrecurring  cost  for  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle
from  fiscal  year  2006  through  2020  is  $18.3  billion.  There  are  many  assumptions
behind  this  estimate,  which  require  a  fill  explanation.  First,  this  assumes  that  the
first CEV test flights would begin no later than 2012, and the first operational dem-
onstration  flight  of  the  CEV  to  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS)  would  be  no
later  than  2014.  This  estimated  total  cost  includes  design,  development,  test,  and
evaluation  (DDT&E)  and  production  costs  for  the  CEV  through  2020;  but  does  not
include  the  recurring  cost  of  operations.  This  total  nonrecurring  cost  includes  not
only expected contract costs, but also all Government costs associated with the CEV.
This preliminary estimate is based on the exploration architecture NASA developed
during  last  year’s  Exploration  System  Architecture  Study  and  forms  the  basis  for
NASA’s FY 2007 budget. Given that the requirements and acquisition processes are
still  under  way,  NASA  performed  cost  risk  analyses  to  develop  the  cost  estimate
with a 65 percent cost confidence level to arrive at the total budget. This confidence
level is appropriate for this phase of the CEV project.

NASA  considers  the  confidence  level  of  65  percent  to  be  appropriate  for  two  rea-
sons.  First,  the  CEV  definition  is  not  complete,  and  the  distribution  on  CEV  cost
is still fairly wide, reflective of the uncertainty in definition. A wide cost distribution
requires  more  cost  reserve  to  achieve  65  percent  confidence  than  will  be  the  case
once  the  CEV  definition  has  matured  and  some  cost  risk  has  been  retired,  leading
to a narrower cost distribution. Once NASA retires risk and the CEV cost distribu-
tion  narrows,  the  Agency  could  find  that  the  CEV  cost  estimate  of  $18.3  billion  is
greater  than  65  percent  confidence.  But  to  be  prudent  at  this  point,  NASA  is  car-
rying enough reserve to achieve a 65 percent confidence level even on the wide cost
distribution that now exists on CEV. Secondly, carrying 65 percent confidence level
cost  estimates  on  individual  projects  such  as  CEV  results  in  about  an  80  percent
cost  confidence  for  the  total  Constellation  Program.  In  investing,  this  is  called  the
‘‘portfolio  effect.’’  In  the  case  of  the  Constellation  portfolio,  since  the  CEV  Program
is  at  the  65  percent  confidence  level  on  each  individual  project,  the  probability  is
that  only  a  few  of  the  individual  projects  will  overrun.  At  65  percent  confidence,
more projects will underrun than overrun, and the total reserve at the Constellation
level should be more than sufficient.

The NASA Authorization Act also asks NASA to report at least two cost estimates
for  the  CEV  that  are  higher  than  those  NASA  had  projected,  but  based  on  NASA’s
past experience. To arrive at two higher CEV cost estimates, NASA would add addi-
tional  program  cost  reserves  to  its  estimates  for  the  work  to  be  done.  Thus,  while
our  current  estimate  of  total  costs  for  the  CEV  is  $18.3  billion  at  65  percent  con-
fidence for fiscal years 2006–2020, NASA’s cost estimates at higher confidence levels
are $20.3 billion for 70 percent cost confidence and $23.8 billion for 80 percent cost
confidence. The higher cost estimates provide additional reserve to address technical
and  schedule  uncertainties.  However,  for  the  level  of  maturity  in  the  designs  and
plans  NASA  has  at  this  time,  NASA  firmly  believes  that  a  65  percent  confidence
level is the appropriate level of confidence for our cost estimates at this early phase
(Phase  A)  of  the  CEV  project.  NASA  will  also  be  employing  a  rigorous  Continuous
Cost-Risk Management (CCRM) approach to retire risks as we progress from Phase
A  through  Phase  B  (Preliminary  Design).  By  effectively  managing  our  risks  in  this
fashion,  the  cost  confidence  for  the  $18.3  billion  estimate  is  expected  to  increase  as
NASA  proceeds  with  Final  Design  and  Fabrication  (Phases  C  and  D,  respectively)
of the CEV.

The NASA Authorization Act further asks NASA for the expected budgets for each
fiscal  year  through  2020  for  human  space  flight,  aeronautics,  space  science,  and
Earth  science.  NASA’s  five-year  budget  run-out  assumptions  for  fiscal  years  2006–
2011  are  presented  as  part  of  NASA’s  FY  2007  budget  request.  The  budget  figures
for the years after 2011 must be considered notional at best.

See  the  enclosed  charts  for  this  information,  which  requires  further  explanation.
The Act asks NASA to assume inflationary growth for its’ top-line budget, so in the
attached  charts  we  show  notional  growth  at  this  level  for  NASA’s  programs,  based

13

on  the  2011  budget.  NASA  assumes  an  inflationary  growth  rate  of  2.4  percent  per
year.  For  the  purpose  of  this  report,  the  human  space  flight  budget  is  treated  as
NASA’s budget categories of Space Operations, except for the Space and Flight Sup-
port theme and Exploration Systems. The Act then asks NASA to assume the higher
cost estimates for the CEV provided above in its report of expected budgets for each
fiscal  year.  However,  we  should  not  confuse  costs  with  budget  in  this  analysis.
These  are  our  cost  estimates  for  the  CEV  with  different  confidence  levels  to  that
expected  cost.  If  there  is  a  change  in  the  cost  estimates,  NASA  will  not  necessarily
change  the  budget  plans.  Instead,  NASA’s  plan  is  to  contain  those  costs  within  the
human space flight budget, thereby, impacting the content of other projects and pro-
grams  within  that  budget.  Thus,  a  higher  than  expected  CEV  cost  would  simply
delay CEV development or production or impact other programs and projects within
that human space flight budget category. NASA continues its ‘‘go-as-you-can-afford-
to-pay’’ strategy toward all of our missions of space exploration, scientific discovery,
and aeronautics research.

Notification Concerning the Award of the

Crew Exploration Vehicle Development Contract

Preface

The  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  intends  to  award  a  design,
development,  production,  and  support  contract  for  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle
(CEV)  not  sooner  than  August  31,  2006.  The  following  report  has  been  prepared
pursuant  to  direction  in  Section  103(a)  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Ad-
ministration Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155) to support the Administrator’s
determination.
1.0 Introduction

The  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  has  specific  goals  and  objectives  of  retiring  the
Shuttle by no later than 2010, providing CEV operational availability no later than
2014,  and  returning  humans  to  the  Moon  by  2020.  During  the  summer  of  2005,
NASA  conducted  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS)  to  define  the
system  architecture  and  concepts  for  the  CEV.  The  architecture  recommended  by
the ESAS defines the CEV as a crew module, service module, and launch abort sys-
tem  arrangement  similar  to  that  of  Apollo.  This  architecture  was  determined  to  be
the  least  costly,  most  rapid,  and  safest  approach  for  bringing  the  lunar  missions  to
fruition in a timely manner.
2.0 Business Case, Acquisition Strategy, and Status

NASA requires the development of a sound business case prior to committing the
Government  to  a  long-term  product  development  effort.  In  establishing  the  acquisi-
tion strategy for the CEV, NASA utilized a knowledge-based and performance-based
acquisition framework, as outlined in this report, which defines how the Agency im-
plemented these provisions for the planned development, production, and fielding of
this new human space vehicle. Additionally, NASA is maximizing competition by so-
liciting  from  industry  their  development,  production,  and  management  approach
with an emphasis on Life Cycle Cost (LCC) for the CEV. The foundation of the CEV
acquisition  strategy  is  to  seek  commitment  from  industry  for  a  design  solution  and
to  control  LCC  through  competition  and  incentives.  While  in  this  competitive  envi-
ronment, NASA will receive firm competitive prices from industry to complete devel-
opment of the CEV and demonstrate a crewed vehicle and an uncrewed cargo vehi-
cle.  Under  this  competition,  NASA  will  also  establish  ‘‘not-to-exceed’’  prices  for  the
production  of  the  required  vehicles  to  support  the  current  flight  manifest  through
2019.

The  CEV  acquisition  utilizes  a  phased  approach.  Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop
Grumman were selected and awarded Phase 1 contracts in July of 2005. These two
vendors  will  remain  under  contract  until  one  is  selected  for  Phase  2  of  the  acquisi-
tion.  To  minimize  the  Government’s  obligation  during  design  and  development,
NASA’s acquisition for Phase 2 divides the CEV contract into three different sched-
ules:

• Schedule  A,  for  design,  development,  test,  and  evaluation  (DDT&E)  and  pro-
duction  of  the  first  certified  flight  units  of  the  crewed  and  uncrewed  vehicle.
Schedule  A  also  includes  the  units  necessary  to  perform  the  flight  tests  re-
quired to certify the CEV.
• Schedule B, for production of flight units beyond the first certified flight units
• Schedule C, for sustaining activities during production and operation.

produced in Schedule A.

Schedule A is authorized at contract award and runs through the first flight dem-
onstration of each design variant of the CEV. Schedule A aids the formulation phase
of  the  project  by  allowing  NASA  to  utilize  the  contractor’s  knowledge  to  develop  a
set  of  validated  requirements  including  component  specifications  by  the  project’s
Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR).  The  CEV  acquisition  strategy  will  allow  NASA
and  the  contractor  to  jointly  attain  knowledge  about  the  project  and  required  re-
sources  that  will  enable  the  generation  of  firm  cost,  schedule,  and  risk  elements.
Shortly  after  PDR,  the  Non-Advocacy  Review  (NAR)  will  be  held  to  establish  the
firm project baseline and provide assurances to our stakeholders that NASA has the
necessary knowledge to move the project forward into development.

Schedule  B  is  a  contract  option  planned  to  be  authorized  post-PDR,  NAR,  and
after  the  Critical  Design  Review  (CDR).  Schedule  B  will  be  used  to  produce  all  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

17

flight  units  other  than  the  first  two  units  produced  under  Schedule  A.  Schedule  C
is  an  additional  contract  option  and  is  planned  to  be  authorized  at  approximately
the same time as Schedule B. The CEV strategy does not commit the Agency to pro-
duction until the NAR milestone is met. First production orders are planned for the
fall  of  2009,  nine  months  after  the  official  acceptance  by  NASA  of  the  baseline  of
the CEV’s design at CDR.

The  acquisition  strategy  being  utilized  for  CEV  provides  an  effective  knowledge-
and  performance-based  approach  for  NASA.  This  strategy  is  designed  to  coincide
with the GAO-defined Knowledge Points and minimizes the Government’s obligation
accordingly.  Use  of  Delivery  Orders  provides  NASA  the  ability  to  order  only  the
units  and  sustaining  engineering  necessary,  with  appropriate  incentives,  at  a  time
when  the  requirement  and  costs  are  better  understood  by  NASA  and  industry.  In-
herent  in  this  strategy  is  the  ability  for  the  Government  to  terminate  these  efforts
if performance does not meet expectations.
3.0 CEV Policy, Regulation, and Directive Compliance

These acquisitions, as well as the project plan, have been built in compliance with
all  NASA’s  defined  policies,  regulations,  and  directives  and,  in  particular,  the  fol-
lowing key documents:

4.0 Technology Maturation

NASA  has  not  identified  any  areas  in  the  CEV  concept  where  the  technology  is
immature. To further improve and characterize NASA’s knowledge, the Agency has
in-house  advanced  development  plans  (ADP)  to  mitigate  cost  and  schedule  risk  for
those areas that are deemed to have the most risk for CEV development. The archi-
tecture  design  chosen  by  NASA,  informed  by  the  ESAS  study,  and  requirements
maturation  through  the  Phase  1  trades  and  analysis,  permits  the  use  of  mature
technology and high-pedigree heritage hardware with space flight experience.

The  Phase  2  proposals  have  been  evaluated  for  technology  risks.  Specifically,  the
CEV Phase 1 contractors provided a priority list of all risks with a narrative of their
mitigations,  mitigation  costs  and  schedules,  and  projected  mitigation  action  result.
In  addition,  the  CEV  Phase  1  contractors’  narratives  included  fall-back  options  for
technologies and their impact to cost and schedule, if used.

With  these  ADP  efforts,  Phase  2  proposals  are  being  evaluated  for  technical  risk
and risk-reduction testing. NASA has confidence that the technologies have been ef-
fectively demonstrated to proceed with design and development of the CEV.
5.0 Risk Management

The  CEV  project,  in  compliance  with  NPR  8000.4,  Risk  Management  Procedural
Requirements,  practices  a  Continuous  Risk  Management  process  that  provides
structured.  management  of  all  risks  facing  the  project  regardless  whether  they  are
based  in  safety,  cost,  schedule,  or  technical  risk  areas.  Each  CEV  team  member  is
actively  engaged  in  identifying  and  logging  all  project  risks  in  the  risk  database  so
that they can be coordinated and pro-actively resolved. Subsystem managers define
the  top  risks  associated  with  their  subsystem  and  allocate  mitigation  resources  as
required.  Risk  Mitigation  Plans  are  developed  for  each  risk,  and  progress  in  car-
rying  out  those  plans  is  reported,  monitored,  and  controlled  on  a  continuous  basis.
The  monthly  CEV  Project-level  Risk  Board  (comprised  of  the  senior  project  leader-
ship)  reviews,  integrates,  and  controls  the  risks  from  each  subsystem  and  deter-
mines  if  these  risks  and  mitigation  strategies  should  be  elevated  to  the  top  CEV
project risk list and coordinated with the Constellation Program office. Named after

the  patterns  that  stars  form  in  the  night  sky,  the  Constellation  Program  is  respon-
sible  for  developing  the  CEV,  CLV,  and  related  exploration  architecture  systems
that  will  provide  humans  the  capabilities  necessary  to  travel  and  explore  the  solar
system.

NASA  has  expended  considerable  time  and  resources  in  the  formulation  phase  of
the  CEV  project  to  best  define  requirements  and  risk  factors  to  mission  success.  In
May  2005,  the  ESAS  was  initiated,  with  one  task,  among  others,  to  provide  an  as-
sessment  of  the  top-level  CEV  requirements.  Further,  the.  ESAS  laid  the  ground-
work  by  defining  the  baseline  technical  content,  cost,  schedule,  and  principal  risk
factors.  Since  that  time,  a  rigorous  Constellation  Program  systems  engineering  and
integration  process  has  been  established  to  control  changes  to  missions,  require-
ments, cost, schedule, and risk as these occur normally through the project formula-
tion and development processes.

NASA  has  spent  a  year  continuing  to  refine  and  mitigate  concept  risks  through
the combination of trades and analysis performed by NASA in-house teams and both
CEV Phase 1 contractors. As a result of the ESAS and the ensuing work, the archi-
tecture  and  the  top-level  requirements  for  the  CEV  were  chosen  and  made  part  of
the  Phase  2  competition.  Additionally,  NASA  established  an  infra-agency  CEV
Smart  Buyer  Team  which  performed  trade  studies  and  design  analyses  that  were
used by the CEV Project Office to understand and verify the appropriateness of the
requirements  incorporated  into  the  CEV  Phase  2  solicitation  and  evaluation  of  pro-
posals. The evolution of the Constellation systems, along with more clear definition
of  the  CEV,  allows  NASA  to  select  a  single  contractor  at  this  time.  Detailed  design
decisions  are  necessary  to  continue  the  development  of  the  CEV,  including  con-
tractor-specific design solutions and definitions of development risks.

Key  aspects  for  managing  contractual  and  schedule  risks  are  incentives  and  con-
trol devices such as the use of Earned Value Management, which NASA has adopted
into its contracting strategy. During DDT&E, NASA will use an end-item award fee.
This makes all award fees subject to final determination that the product has been
demonstrated to meet all requirements. The contractor will have incentives to iden-
tify  risks  early  and  to  quickly  and  pro-actively  mitigate  them.  This  is  a  powerful
tool for NASA and provides incentives to be successful on all elements of the project:
cost (including life cycle costs), schedule, technical, and quality. There will be inher-
ent  motivation  toward  schedule  performance  by  means  of  concluding  each  project
milestone  with  an  award  fee  determination.  Since  no  provisional  payments  will  be
made,  industry  will  not  receive  interim  payments  until  the  completion  of  an  estab-
lished  project  milestone.  A  slip  in  schedule  will  be  reflected  both  in  a  delay  in  re-
ceipt  of  the  interim  payment  and  a  lower  evaluation  score  in  the  associated  NASA
evaluation.

In summary, the CEV project utilizes a structured process for managing all risks
which  encompasses  safety,  cost,  schedule,  or  technical  risk  areas.  Risk  Mitigation
Plans are developed for each risk, and progress of these risk mitigation plans is re-
ported,  monitored,  and  controlled  on  a  continuous  basis  by  project  management.
Risk  integration  is  performed  at  all  levels  to  ensure  efficient,  effective  risk  mitiga-
tion within the CEV Project and across the Constellation Program. Further, consid-
erable  work  was  done  in  the  formulation  phase  to  understand  and  characterize  the
risk trade space with various requirements and development options.
6.0 Summary

In accordance with Section 103 (a) of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005, NASA
has  clearly  identified  technical,  cost,  schedule,  and  safety  risks  and  has  plans  to
manage  them.  NASA  has  baselined  an  architecture  that  has  mature  technologies.
Finally, the NASA CEV Project has complied with all relevant policies, regulations,
and directives of the Agency.

The CEV design, development, and acquisition efforts are on track for the identi-
fied Agency milestones. Selection of a CEV Prime Contractor is a major step forward
in the implementation of the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA has demonstrated
a sound acquisition strategy that seeks commitment from industry for a design solu-
tion and to control LCC through competition and incentives. NASA is ready to exe-
cute  its  next  step,  ‘‘down-select’’  to  a  single  Prime  and  award  a  contract  in  order
to:

• Finalize NASA and contractor design solutions.
• Allow  open  communications  with  the  contractor  that  is  going  to  design  and
develop  the  CEV.  Communication  between  Government  and  the  Phase  1  in-
dustry teams is currently limited due to source selection constraints.

• Proceed to the design review milestones with a single contractor.

To date, NASA has received firm competitive prices from industry to complete de-
velopment  of  the  CEV.  NASA  has  identified  no  technology  issues.  NASA  has  dem-
onstrated its technical, cost, and schedule risk management planning and has miti-
gations,  budget,  controls,  and  assessments  in  place.  Earned  value  and  other  cost
controls  and  reporting  requirements  are  in  place  on  all  Government  and  contract
deliverables.

The combination of the knowledge gained from the ESAS, the Smart Buyer team,
the  work  in  the  CEV  Phase  1  contracts  and  Phase  2  proposals  and  processes  for
risk  control  and  integration  enables  NASA  to  ‘‘down  select’’  a  single  Prime  con-
tractor.  Hence,  NASA  will  be  able  to  baseline  an  industry  approach  and  commit-
ment to meet the desired outcomes of the CEV project.

LETTER FROM GAO TO CHAIRMAN BOEHLERT

JULY 17, 2006

The Honorable Sherwood Boehlert
Chairman
The Honorable Bart Gordon
Ranking Minority Member
Committee on Science
House of Representatives
Subject:  NASA:  Long-Term  Commitment  to  and  Investment  in  Space  Exploration
Program Requires More Knowledge

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to spend near-
ly $230 billion over the next two decades implementing the Vision for Space Explo-
ration.  In  January  2006,  NASA  publicly  released  its  Exploration  Systems  Architec-
ture Study (ESAS), which is an effort to identify the best architecture and strategy
to  implement  the  President’s  2004  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  (Vision).1 The  cost
estimate  for  implementing  the  ESAS  through  fiscal  year  2011  exceeds  $31  billion.
The estimate through fiscal year 2018 is over $122 billion, and the estimate through
fiscal  year  2025  is  nearly  $230  billion.2 These  estimates  include  the  architecture,
robotic  precursor  missions,  supporting  technologies,  and  funding  needed  to  service
the  International  Space  Station  (ISS).3 NASA  plans  to  implement  this  architecture
through  a  ‘‘go  as  you  can  afford  to  pay’’  approach,  wherein  lower-priority  efforts
would be deferred, descoped, or discontinued to allow NASA to stay within its avail-
able budget profile. This approach assumes NASA’s budget will increase moderately
to  keep  pace  with  inflation.  Given  the  long-term  fiscal  imbalances  that  will  chal-
lenge  the  entire  Federal  Government  now  and  in  the  future,  it  would  be  prudent
for  NASA  to  establish  a  program  that  reduces  the  risk  that  significant  additional
funding, beyond moderate increases for inflation, will be required to execute the pro-
gram.4 Government  leaders  will  have  to  make  difficult  decisions  to  resolve  such
challenges,  and  the  debate  over  the  potential  cost  and  the  Federal  Government’s
role  in  implementing  the  Vision  are  emblematic  of  the  challenges  the  Nation  will
need to resolve in the years ahead.

Because of the significance of this investment, competing demands on the federal
discretionary  budget,  and  the  importance  of  the  success  of  NASA’s  exploration  pro-
gram to the future of U.S. human space flight, you requested that we assess (1) the
extent to which NASA has identified the architecture and costs necessary to imple-
ment  the  Vision,  (2)  whether  NASA’s  exploration  architecture  cost  estimates  fit
within  the  Agency’s  projected  available  budgets,  and  (3)  the  risks  associated  with
NASA’s acquisition strategy for the CEV project.

We presented our preliminary findings to your staff in May 2006. Because of your
committee’s  interest  in  how  NASA  is  implementing  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration, we are enclosing the full briefing that supported that May presentation with
this report (see Encl. II), along with a summary of our findings and conclusions. We
are  recommending  that  the  NASA  Administrator  modify  the  current  CEV  acquisi-
tion strategy to ensure that the Agency does not commit itself, and in turn the Fed-
eral Government, to a long-term contractual obligation prior to establishing a sound
business  case  at  the  project’s  preliminary  design  review.  In  written  comments,
NASA  non-concurred  with  our  recommendation  and  stated  that  it  has  the  appro-
priate level of knowledge to proceed with its current acquisition strategy. As a result
of  its  nonconcurrence,  we  are  including  as  a  matter  for  congressional  consideration
that the Congress should consider restricting NASA’s appropriations and obligations

1 The ESAS architecture supports the development of a new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV),
Crew  Launch  Vehicle  (CLV),  a  Cargo  Launch  Vehicle  (CaLV),  and  other  supporting  systems.
The architecture also calls for various Research and Technology (R&T) and Robotic Lunar Explo-
ration Program (RLEP) projects.

2 All cost estimates related to the Vision are reported as inflated (‘‘real year’’) dollars.
3 NASA’s cost estimate through 2011—$31.2 billion—included the costs of the R&T and RLEP
projects  needed  to  support  the  architecture.  Its  estimate  for  the  first  lunar  landing—$104  bil-
lion—did not include $18 billion in funding for R&T and RLEP projects. To ensure consistency,
the estimates for 2018 and 2025 are presented with R&T and RLEP funding included.

for the CEV project to only the amount of funding necessary to successfully complete
the project’s preliminary design review.
Background

The Vision includes plans to explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond.5 The first step
in implementing the Vision is to retire the Space Shuttle after completing assembly
of the ISS by the end of the decade. NASA currently plans to retire the Space Shut-
tle  in  2010,  creating  a  potential  gap  in  U.S.  human  space  flight  of  up  to  four  years
before  development  of  the  CEV  and  the  CLV  is  complete.  Congress  has  voiced  con-
cern  over  the  United  States  not  having  continuous  access  to  space,  and  NASA  has
made  it  a  priority  to  minimize  the  gap  by  accelerating  the  CEV  project  to  have  it
in  service  as  close  to  2010  as  possible.  NASA’s  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Direc-
torate’s  (ESMD)  Constellation  program  is  responsible  for  the  development  of  both
the  CEV  and  the  CLV.  NASA  awarded  concept  development  contracts  for  the  CEV
project  to  both  Lockheed  Martin  and  Northrop  Grumman  in  July  2005  and  plans
to  award  a  contract  for  design,  development,  production  and  sustainment  in  Sep-
tember  2006.  That  contract  could  extend  through  2019.  For  the  CLV,  NASA  plans
to  award  a  sole-source  contract  for  the  first  stage  of  the  CLV  to  ATK–Thiokol,  the
manufacturer  of  the  Shuttle’s  Reusable  Solid  Rocket  Motor,  in  October  2006.  Also,
the Agency plans to award Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, the developer of the Space
Shuttle  Main  Engine  (SSME)  and  J–2  engines,  a  sole-source  contract  for  develop-
ment  of  the  J–2X  engine  in  November  2006.  These  contractors  are  currently  plan-
ning their respective efforts under interim contract arrangements. NASA has start-
ed  in-house  preliminary  design  work  on  the  CLV  upper  stage  structures  and  avi-
onics  and  plans  to  begin  awarding  competitive  contracts  for  production  of  these
items in May 2007.

Despite  many  successes  in  the  exploration  of  space,  such  as  landing  the  Path-
finder  and  Exploration  Rovers  on  Mars,  the  loss  of  life,  unsuccessful  missions,  and
unforeseen cost overruns have recently increased the level of concern over the bene-
fits  of  such  exploration,  particularly  with  regard  to  human  space  flight  activities.
NASA has had difficulty bringing a number of projects to completion, including sev-
eral  efforts  to  build  a  second  generation  of  reusable  human  space  flight  vehicle  to
replace  the  Space  Shuttle.  NASA  has  attempted  several  expensive  endeavors  such
as the National Aero-Space Plane, the X–33 and X–34, and the Space Launch Initia-
tive,  among  others.  While  these  endeavors  have  helped  to  advance  scientific  and
technical knowledge, none have completed their objective of fielding a new reusable
space vehicle. We estimate that these unsuccessful development efforts have cost ap-
proximately $4.8 billion since the 1980s. The high cost of these unsuccessful efforts
and  the  potential  costs  of  implementing  the  Vision  make  it  important  that  NASA
achieve success in its new exploration program.

Our past work has shown that developing a sound business case, based on match-
ing  requirements  to  available  and  reasonably  expected  resources  before  committing
to  a  new  product  development  effort,  reduces  risk  and  increases  the  likelihood  of
successful outcomes.6 At the heart of a business case is a knowledge-based approach
to product development that is a best practice among leading commercial firms and
successful  government  system  developers.  For  a  program  to  increase  its  chances  of
delivering a successful product, high levels of knowledge should be demonstrated be-
fore  managers  make  significant  program  commitments.  In  essence,  knowledge  sup-
plants  risk  over  time.  This  building  of  knowledge  can  be  described  as  three  levels
that should be attained over the course of the program:

(1) At  program  start,  the  customer’s  needs  should  match  the  developer’s  avail-
able  resources  in  terms  of  availability  of  mature  technologies,  time,  human
capital, and funding.

5 The Vision includes a return to the Moon that is intended ultimately to enable future explo-
ration  of  Mars  and  other  destinations.  To  accomplish  this,  NASA  initially  plans  to  (1)  complete
its  work  on  the  International  Space  Station  by  2010,  fulfilling  its  commitment  to  15  inter-
national partner countries; (2) begin developing a new manned exploration vehicle to replace the
Space  Shuttle;  and  (3)  return  to  the  Moon  no  later  than  2020  in  preparation  for  future,  more
ambitious missions.

(2) Midway  through  development,  the  product’s  design  should  be  stable  and

demonstrate that it is capable of meeting performance requirements.

(3) By the time of the production decision, the product must be shown to be pro-
ducible  within  cost,  schedule,  and  quality  targets,  and  have  demonstrated
its reliability.

Our work has shown that programs that have not attained the level of knowledge
needed to support a sound business case have been plagued by cost overruns, sched-
ule  delays,  decreased  capability,  and  overall  poor  performance.  With  regard  to
NASA,  we  have  reported  that  in  some  cases  the  Agency’s  failure  to  define  require-
ments  adequately  and  develop  realistic  cost  estimates—two  key  elements  of  a  busi-
ness case—resulted in projects costing more, taking longer, and achieving less than
originally planned.
Summary

Although NASA is continuing to refine its exploration architecture cost estimates,
the Agency cannot at this time provide a firm estimate of what it will take to imple-
ment  the  architecture.  The  absence  of  firm  cost  estimates  is  mainly  due  to  the  fact
that the program is in the early stages of its life cycle. According to NASA cost-esti-
mating  guidance,  early  life  cycle  phase  estimates  are  generally  based  upon  para-
metric  models,  which  use  data  from  projects  with  similar  attributes  to  predict  cost
because there are usually many unknowns and actual cost or performance data are
not available. NASA preliminarily identified the resources needed to implement the
architecture as outlined in the architecture study primarily through the use of such
models.  NASA  conducted  a  cost  risk  analysis  of  its  preliminary  estimates  through
fiscal  year  2011.  On  the  basis  of  this  analysis  and  through  the  addition  of  pro-
grammatic reserves (20 percent on all development and 10 percent on all production
costs), NASA is 65 percent confident that the actual cost of the program will either
meet  or  be  less  than  its  estimate  of  $31.2  billion  through  fiscal  year  2011.  For  the
cost estimates for beyond 2011, when most of the cost risk for implementing the ar-
chitecture  will  be  realized,  NASA  has  not  applied  a  confidence  level  distinction.
Since  NASA  released  its  preliminary  estimates,  the  Agency  has  continued  to  make
architecture changes. For example, following the issuance of the architecture study,
NASA  conducted  several  analysis  cycles  during  which  various  aspects  of  the  archi-
tecture  have  evolved,  such  as  the  diameter  of  the  CEV,  the  engine  used  to  support
the  upper  stage  of  the  CLV,  and  the  size  of  the  Reusable  Solid  Rocket  Booster  on
the CLV. While these changes, and others, are appropriate for this phase of the pro-
gram, when concepts are still being developed, they leave the Agency in the position
of  being  unable  to  firmly  identify  program  requirements  and  needed  resources,
which  can  also  be  expected  at  this  phase  of  the  program.  According  to  NASA  offi-
cials,  once  they  receive  more  detailed  contractor  inputs,  the  Agency  will  be  able  to
produce  higher-fidelity  estimates  of  program  cost.  NASA  plans  to  commit  to  a  firm
cost  estimate  at  the  preliminary  design  review  (PDR)  in  2008,  when  the  program’s
requirements, design, and schedule will all be baselined.

NASA will be challenged to implement the architecture recommended in the study
within its projected budget. Whether using the architecture study estimates of funds
available or NASA’s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Submission for ESMD that was based
on the architecture study cost estimates, there are years when NASA does not have
sufficient  funding  to  implement  the  architecture.  Some  yearly  shortfalls  exceed  $1
billion,  while  in  other  years  the  funding  available  exceeds  needed  resources.  NASA
maintains that the architecture could be implemented within the projected available
budgets through fiscal year 2011 when funding is considered cumulatively. In addi-
tion,  NASA  preliminarily  projects  multibillion-dollar  shortfalls  for  ESMD  in  all  fis-
cal years from 2014 to 2020, with an overall deficit through 2025 of over $18 billion.
In  the  short-term,  NASA  is  attempting  to  address  this  problem  within  the  Con-
stellation program by redirecting funds to that program from other ESMD activities
to  provide  a  significant  surplus  for  fiscal  years  2006  and  2007  to  cover  projected
shortfalls  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2009.  In  addition,  the  Constellation  program  has
requested  more  funds  than  required  for  its  projects  in  several  early  years  to  cover
shortfalls  in  later  years.  For  example,  the  Exploration  Communication  and  Naviga-
tion  Systems  project  within  the  Constellation  program  plans  to  roll  over  $56.2  mil-
lion from the fiscal year 2007 budget to make up for budget shortfalls in fiscal years
2008,  2009,  and  2010.  NASA  officials  stated  the  identified  budget  phasing  problem
could  worsen  given  that  changes  made  to  the  exploration  architecture  following
issuance of the study will likely add to the near-term development costs, where the
funding  is  already  constrained.  In  addition,  NASA’s  estimates  beyond  2010  are
based upon a surplus of well over $1 billion in fiscal year 2011 due to the retirement
of  the  Space  Shuttle  fleet  in  2010.  However,  NASA  officials  said  the  costs  for  retir-

23

ing  the  Space  Shuttle  and  transitioning  to  the  new  program  are  not  fully  under-
stood, and thus the expected surplus could be less than anticipated.

NASA’s current acquisition strategy for the CEV places the project at risk of sig-
nificant  cost  overruns,  schedule  delays,  and  performance  shortfalls  because  it  com-
mits  the  government  to  a  long-term  product  development  effort  before  establishing
a sound business case. NASA plans to award a contract for the design, development,
production,  and  sustainment  of  the  CEV  in  September  2006—before  it  has  devel-
oped  key  elements  of  a  sound  business  case,  including  well-defined  requirements,  a
preliminary  design,  mature  technology,  and  firm  cost  estimates.  The  period  of  per-
formance  for  the  contract  scheduled  for  award  in  September  2006  will  extend
through at least 2014, with the possibility of extending through 2019. This contract
will  comprise  all  design,  development,  and  test  and  evaluation  activities,  including
production of ground and flight test articles and at least four operational CEVs. Al-
though  NASA  is  committing  to  a  long-term  contract,  it  will  not  have  the  elements
of  a  sound  business  case  in  place  until  the  project  level  PDR  in  fiscal  year  2008.
Awarding  a  contract  for  design,  development,  production,  and  sustainment  of  the
project  as  NASA  has  planned  places  the  CEV  project  at  increased  risk  of  cost
growth,  schedule  delays,  and  performance  shortfalls.  At  PDR,  NASA  will  likely  (a)
have  the  increased  knowledge  necessary  to  develop  a  sound  business  case  that  in-
cludes  high-fidelity,  engineering-based  estimates  of  life  cycle  cost  for  the  CEV
project,  (b)  be  in  a  better  position  to  commit  the  government  to  a  long-term  effort,
and (c) have more certainty in advising Congress on required resources.

Implementing the Vision over the coming decades will require hundreds of billions
of  dollars  and  a  sustained  commitment  from  multiple  Administrations  and  Con-
gresses  over  the  length  of  the  program.  The  realistic  identification  of  the  resources
needed  to  achieve  the  Agency’s  short-term  goals  would  provide  support  for  such  a
sustained  commitment  over  the  long-term.  With  a  range  of  federal  commitments
binding  the  fiscal  future  of  the  United  States,  competition  for  resources  within  the
Federal Government will only increase over the next several decades. Consequently,
it  is  incumbent  upon  NASA  to  ensure  that  it  is  wisely  investing  its  existing  re-
sources. As NASA begins to implement the Vision with several key acquisition deci-
sions planned to occur this fall, it will be essential that the Agency ensure that the
investment  decisions  it  is  making  are  sound  and  are  based  upon  high  levels  of
knowledge.  NASA  should  make  the  prudent  decision  now  to  ensure  that  it  has  at-
tained  the  appropriate  level  of  knowledge  to  support  a  sound  business  case  before
it commits to the project. However, under the current acquisition strategy for CEV,
key  knowledge—including  well-defined  requirements,  a  preliminary  design,  mature
technology,  and  firm  cost  estimates—will  not  be  known  until  over  a  year  after  the
expected contract award date. Nevertheless, NASA plans to commit the government
to  a  long-term  contract.  This  approach  increases  the  risk  that  the  project  will  en-
counter  significant  cost  overruns,  schedule  delays,  and  decreased  capability.  Given
the  Nation’s  fiscal  challenges  and  those  that  exist  within  NASA,  the  availability  of
significant  additional  resources  to  address  such  issues,  should  they  occur,  is  un-
likely.  With  the  impending  decisions  pertaining  to  the  CEV,  NASA  has  the  oppor-
tunity to establish a firm foundation for the entire Constellation program by ensur-
ing  that  the  appropriate  level  of  knowledge  is  available  before  proceeding  with  its
acquisition strategy and committing the government to a long-term design, develop-
ment, and production effort.
Recommendation for Executive Action

Because  of  the  importance  of  the  CEV  project  to  NASA’s  overall  implementation
of  the  Vision,  NASA  should  focus  on  ensuring  that  its  acquisition  approach  for  the
CEV  project  does  not  place  the  government  at  risk  by  committing  to  a  long-term
design  and  development  effort  without  the  knowledge  needed  to  make  wise  invest-
ment  decisions.  We  therefore  recommend  that  the  NASA  Administrator  modify  the
current  CEV  acquisition  strategy  to  ensure  that  the  Agency  does  not  commit  itself,
and  in  turn  the  Federal  Government,  to  a  long-term  contractual  obligation  prior  to
demonstrating,  through  the  establishment  of  a  sound  business  case  at  the  project’s
preliminary design review, that the project is affordable and executable.
Matter for Congressional Consideration

Based  on  its  response  to  our  report,  it  appears  that  NASA  plans  to  proceed  with
its acquisition strategy for the CEV and award a long-term contract for the project,
although  it  continues  to  lack  sufficient  knowledge  and  a  sound  business  case  for
doing  so.  Congress  is  currently  being  asked  to  approve  NASA’s  fiscal  year  2007
funding request and will be asked to approve fiscal year 2008 and perhaps the fiscal
year 2009 funding requests for the CEV project before NASA has demonstrated such
knowledge and has provided evidence, based on that knowledge, that the project will

be executable within existing and expected resources. In light of the fact that NASA
plans  to  award  the  contract  for  the  CEV  in  September  2006,  Congress  should  con-
sider restricting annual appropriations and limiting NASA’s obligations for the CEV
project to only the amount of funding necessary to support activities needed to suc-
cessfully complete the project’s preliminary design review.
Agency Comments and Our Evaluation

In  written  comments  on  a  draft  of  this  report  (see  Encl.  I),  NASA  non-concurred
with our recommendation that it modify the current CEV acquisition strategy to en-
sure  that  the  Agency  does  not  commit  itself,  and  in  turn  the  Federal  Government,
to  a  long-term  contractual  commitment  prior  to  establishing  a  sound  business  case
at the project’s preliminary design review. NASA stated that it has the appropriate
level  of  knowledge  to  proceed  with  its  acquisition  plan  to  ‘‘down  select’’  to  a  single
Crew Exploration Vehicle prime contractor in September 2006. NASA added that it
is  maximizing  competition  by  soliciting  from  industry  a  development,  production,
and management approach with an emphasis on life cycle cost. In the area of tech-
nology  maturity,  NASA  stated  that  it  has  a  plan  and  process  in  place  to  address
the  Thermal  Protection  and  Landing  subsystems  technology  risks  through  in-house
development  work  and  collaboration  with  the  prime  contractor.  NASA  also  noted
that during its design, development, and test and evaluation effort, the Agency will
be using an end-item award fee, which would make all award fees subject to a final
evaluation to determine how well the product met requirements, including cost and
schedule.

The CEV acquisition strategy is not knowledge-based in that it calls for maturing
technologies, designing systems, and preparing for initial production concurrently—
an approach that our work has shown carries the increased risk of cost and schedule
overruns  and  decreased  technical  capability.  Therefore,  we  disagree  with  NASA’s
statement that it has the appropriate level of knowledge to proceed with its current
acquisition  strategy  and  award  a  long-term  contract  for  the  project  prior  to  obtain-
ing sufficient knowledge. Specifically:

• In  its  response,  NASA  suggests  that  there  would  be  no  benefit  in  retaining
two prime contractors for the CEV project through the preliminary design re-
view  and  that  the  best  return  on  its  investment  would  be  gained  by  down-
selecting  to  one  contractor  and  awarding  the  contract  in  September  2006.
Contrary to NASA’s response, addressing our recommendation would not pre-
clude the Agency from down-selecting to one contractor. The thrust of our rec-
ommendation  is  that  NASA  should  lessen  the  government’s  obligation  to  the
project at such an early stage when realistic cost estimates have yet to be es-
tablished  and  requirements  are  not  fully  defined,  and  therefore  limit  the
scope of the contract to activities needed to successfully complete the prelimi-
nary  design  review.  At  that  point  the  project  should  have  in  place  a  sound
business  case  for  proceeding  and  hence  be  in  a  better  position  to  justify  con-
tinued  investment.  Implementation  of  the  recommendation  could  be  accom-
plished  through  various  means,  including  by  retaining  two  contractors
through  the  preliminary  design  review  and  awarding  a  contract  at  that  time
or by down-selecting as planned in September 2006 and limiting the scope of
the contract as described above.
• NASA’s suggestion that it is maximizing competition by soliciting from indus-
try  its  development,  production,  and  management  approach  and  that  it  will
receive  firm  competitive  prices  from  industry  for  completion  of  development
and  demonstration  of  two  vehicles  has  little  basis.  First,  while  the  current
structure  will  allow  for  competition  in  the  short-term,  the  benefits  of  such
competition  will  be  short-lived.  Without  well-defined  requirements,  mature
technologies,  an  approved  preliminary  design,  and  realistic  cost  estimates,
NASA has insufficient information to ensure that it is obtaining firm competi-
tive  prices  for  the  work  conducted  for  the  entirety  of  Schedule  A—especially
for activities beyond the project’s preliminary design review.
Because  NASA  continues  to  refine  the  project’s  requirements,  as  dem-
onstrated  by  the  numerous  changes  to  the  exploration  architecture  as  dis-
cussed in our report, it cannot provide a firm estimate of project cost. Without
such  information,  it  will  likely  be  difficult  for  NASA  to  establish  realistic
‘‘not-to-exceed’’  prices  for  Schedule  B  activities.  Under  the  current  strategy,
NASA  will  not  have  high-fidelity,  engineering-based  estimates  of  life  cycle
costs for the CEV until the preliminary design review. As outlined in this re-
port,  projects  with  cost  estimates  based  on  early,  evolving  designs  and  top-
level  requirements  are  at  increased  risk  of  cost  growth  relative  to  estimates
based on mature designs and detailed requirements—which could be achieved

at  the  preliminary  design  review.  According  to  NASA,  it  plans  to  obtain  this
and  further  knowledge  about  program  cost,  schedule,  and  risk  elements  fol-
lowing  the  contract  award  and  in  conjunction  with  the  contractor.  In  the  ab-
sence  of  such  information,  it  is  not  clear  how  NASA  can  substantiate  its
statement that it has the knowledge necessary to commit to activities beyond
the  project’s  preliminary  design  review.  Further,  it  cannot  provide  Congress
with  assurance  of  the  appropriateness  of  requested  funding  for  the  project.
• NASA stated that its current acquisition strategy for the CEV minimizes the
government’s  obligation  during  development  by  dividing  the  CEV  contract
into  three  separate  schedules.  All  three  schedules,  however,  will  be  awarded
in  September  2006  as  part  of  one  contract.  Although  NASA  plans  to  include
language in the negotiated CEV contract to state that the minimum quantity
under  Schedule  B  will  not  be  applicable  until  that  schedule’s  period  of  per-
formance  begins  in  2009—a  step  that  would  lessen  the  government’s  obliga-
tion  during  production—it  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  all  Schedule  A
activities  at  the  time  of  contract  award.  These  activities  include  all  design,
development,  and  test  and  evaluation  activities,  as  well  as  the  production  of
two  operational  vehicles.  Contractually  obligating  the  government  to  even
these  Schedule  A  activities,  before  it  has  established  a  sound  business  case
to  support  such  a  commitment,  is  not  in  line  with  our  knowledge-based  ap-
proach and is ultimately not in the best interest of the government.

• NASA’s  investment  in  identifying  and  maturing  the  Thermal  Protection  and
Landing Subsystems is a step in the right direction to ensure that these tech-
nologies  are  mature  and  available  when  needed.  NASA  has  no  guarantee,
however,  that  these  critical  technologies  will  be  mature  by  the  time  of  the
project’s  preliminary  design  review—the  point  at  which  our  work  has  shown
that  technologies  should  be  mature  in  order  to  decrease  the  risk  of  cost  and
schedule  growth.  NASA’s  proposed  commitment  to  the  project  for  activities
beyond  the  preliminary  design  review  before  retiring  these  technology  risks
increases  the  likelihood  that  the  project  will  experience  schedule  delays  and
cost overruns.

• NASA  maintains  that  program  risks  have  been  marginalized  and  that  the
Agency  will  utilize  incentives,  including  end-item  award  fees,  to  ensure  con-
tractor performance. NASA suggests that the incentives it plans to use in the
form of end-item award fees will be a powerful tool for meeting cost schedule,
technical,  and  quality  goals.  The  use  of  these  tools,  however,  does  not  com-
pensate for proceeding with a risky acquisition, nor do they lessen NASA’s re-
sponsibility  to  implement  an  executable  program  from  the  start.  For  them  to
function as intended, NASA needs to address the more fundamental issues re-
lated  to  its  acquisition  strategy,  including  its  lack  of  a  sound  business  case
for the CEV project.

• Finally,  the  use  of  cost-reimbursable  contracting,  while  appropriate  for  early
development  and  design  efforts,  places  most  of  the  cost  risk  for  the  project
on the government. Given the nature of this effort, it is likely that the project
will  change  significantly  as  it  moves  forward.  Therefore,  any  scope  changes
or schedule slips could translate into additional contract cost for NASA. Such
cost impacts could be minimized if NASA limited its contractual obligation to
those  activities  needed  to  achieve  a  successful  preliminary  design  review,  as
we  recommended.  In  addition,  limiting  the  scope  of  the  CEV  contract  would
allow both NASA and Congress to assess the project’s progress at the prelimi-
nary  design  review  and  to  decide  if  continued  investment  in  the  project  is
prudent and in the best interest of the government.

It  is  important  to  note  that  Congress  will  continue  to  be  asked  to  make  funding
commitments  in  advance  of  CEV  project  events  that  would  demonstrate  that  the
project  has  the  knowledge  necessary  to  support  a  sound  business  case.  Specifically,
NASA’s funding request for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are scheduled to be approved
before  the  CEV  holds  its  preliminary  design  review.  Since  the  preliminary  design
review  is  currently  scheduled  for  March  2008,  this  may  also  be  the  case  for  fiscal
year  2009.  Congress  should  safeguard  against  a  situation  in  which  contractual  and
budget  decisions  could  hinder  its  ability  to  tie  further  investments  in  the  CEV
project to demonstrated progress at the preliminary design review. As such, we have
included a matter for congressional consideration.

We  also  received  technical  comments  from  NASA,  which  have  been  addressed  in

the report, as appropriate.

Scope and Methodology

26

To assess the extent to which NASA has identified the architecture and costs nec-
essary  to  implement  the  Vision  and  whether  NASA’s  exploration  architecture  cost
estimates fit within the Agency’s projected available budgets, we reviewed and ana-
lyzed  NASA’s  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study,  fiscal  year  2007  budget  re-
quest,  ground  rules  and  assumptions  provided  from  the  Constellation  program  to
project level management estimators to perform the bottom up review, guidance for
use  in  preparing  the  fiscal  year  2008  budget  request,  NASA  cost-estimating  guid-
ance in the NASA Cost Estimating Handbook, and congressional hearings and testi-
monies  pertaining  to  NASA  and  the  Vision.  We  also  conducted  interviews  with
NASA  headquarters  officials  from  the  Cost  Analysis  Division,  the  Exploration  Sys-
tems  Mission  Directorate,  and  Constellation  program  officials,  Constellation  pro-
gram  and  CEV  project  officials  at  Johnson  Space  Center;  CLV  project  officials  at
Marshall  Space  Flight  Center;  and  cost  analysts  from  the  Kennedy  Space  Center.
During  these  interviews,  we  discussed  the  methodologies  used  in  preparing  the
ESAS  and  subsequent  cost  estimates,  architecture  changes  after  the  ESAS  and  the
trades  being  considered,  budgeting  issues,  and  procurement  strategies  and  activi-
ties.

To  assess  the  risks  associated  with  NASA’s  acquisition  strategy  for  the  CEV
project,  we  reviewed  and  analyzed  CEV  project  documentation,  including  draft
project  plans,  draft  requirements  documents,  technology  development  plans,  docu-
mentation  included  in  the  contract  request  for  proposals,  and  past  NASA  human
space flight acquisition programs. We compared NASA’s plans for the CEV with cri-
teria  contained  in  GAO  best  practices  work  on  systems  acquisition.  We  also  con-
ducted  interviews  with  NASA  headquarters  officials  from  the  Exploration  Systems
Mission  Directorate  and  Constellation  Systems  officials,  Constellation  program  and
CEV project officials at Johnson Space Center, and CLV project officials at Marshall
Space Flight Center.

We  conducted  our  work  from  January  2006  to  May  2006  in  accordance  with  gen-

erally accepted government auditing standards.

As agreed with your offices, unless you announce its contents earlier, we will not
distribute this report further until 10 days from its date. At that time, we will send
copies  of  the  report  to  NASA’s  Administrator  and  interested  congressional  commit-
tees. We will also make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the re-
port will be available at no charge on GAO’s web site at http://www.gao.gov.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  hearing  will  come  to  order.  I  want  to
welcome  everyone  to  today’s  important  hearing:  the  Committee’s
first  public  discussion  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  or  Orion,
project since we had the Administrator before us in March, and the
first  review  in  Congress  since  Lockheed  Martin  was  awarded  the
contract for Orion at the end of August.

Let me start by reiterating my support for the President’s Vision
for  Space  Exploration,  which  I  think  is  an  important  national  un-
dertaking.  Let  me  also  reiterate  my  determination  that  NASA  not
become  a  single-mission  agency.  Human  space  flight  can’t  succeed
at the expense of Earth science, space science, and aeronautics.

So  NASA  has  to  move  ahead  with  Orion  deliberately,  but  also
cautiously,  and  Congress  has  to  keep  a  keen  and  constant  eye  on
the  project.  Neither  the  Agency  nor  the  Nation  can  afford  another
space  station,  a  project  that  for  all  its  technical  magnificence  has
seen its costs balloon while its capabilities shrank to near the van-
ishing point.

This  may  very  well  be  the  last  hearing  on  NASA.  Some  people
will  breathe  a  sigh  of  relief.  But  I  hope  we  will  have  set  a  pattern
of friendly, but rigorous vigilance that will be continued as the Na-
tion moves ahead with work on returning to the Moon.

I  am  pleased  to  say  that  NASA  itself  also  seems  to  be  operating
at  a  high  level  of  vigilance.  The  agency  is  trying  to  base  Orion  on
technologies that have already been used successfully in other pro-
grams;  and  I  am  also  very  glad  to  see  that  NASA  modified  the
Lockheed  Martin  contract  for  Orion  as  a  result  of  the  General  Ac-
countability Office study this committee requested. That is a great
example of how sensible oversight can work to the advantage of the
Agency being reviewed, and frankly, it is a credit to this committee,
to GAO, and to NASA that the contract was modified.

But  that  hardly  closes  the  issue  before  us.  GAO  correctly  points
out  that  NASA  does  not  yet  have  a  final  design  or  cost  estimate
for  Orion.  That  is  not  a  criticism  of  NASA,  that  is  just  where  we
are in the process, and Congress has to recognize how fluid the sit-
uation is, although far less fluid than it was at this time last year.
GAO  believes  that  NASA  should  not  have  let  as  an  extensive
contract  as  it  did,  given  the  uncertainties,  and  they  make  a  plau-
sible case. NASA has made reasonable arguments in response, and
the  contract  has  been  let  so  we  don’t  have  to  rehash  that  issue
here.  What  we  do  have  to  do  is  learn  what  should  Congress  be
doing,  and  what  information  should  it  be  seeking  to  exercise  strict
oversight  as  the  project  moves  forward.  And  what  additional  steps
should NASA take to make sure that project costs do not escalate?
I look forward to getting answers to those questions. We have the
right  folks  before  us  to  get  those  answers,  and  I  want  to  welcome
Dr.  Scott  Horowitz  from  NASA  for  his  first  public  appearance  be-
fore  the  Committee.  I  think  you  will  see,  after  you  hear  and  are
exposed  more  to  Dr.  Horowitz,  he  is  a  congenial,  knowledgeable
guy, and it is a pleasure to work with him. He meets with staff all
the time, and that is a productive time use, and hopefully, we won’t
be as hard on him today as they are.

With that, let me turn to my co-partner here, Mr. Gordon of Ten-

nessee.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN SHERWOOD L. BOEHLERT

I  want  to  welcome  everyone  to  today’s  important  hearing,  this  committee’s  first
public  discussion  of  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  or  Orion,  project  since  we  had
the  Administrator  before  us  in  March,  and  the  first  review  in  Congress  since  Lock-
heed Martin was awarded the contract for Orion at the end of August.

Let me start by reiterating my support for the President’s Vision for Space Explo-
ration,  which  I  think  is  an  important  national  undertaking.  And  let  me  also  reit-
erate  my  determination  that  NASA  not  become  a  single-mission  agency;  human
space  flight  can’t  succeed  at  the  expense  of  Earth  science,  space  science  and  aero-
nautics.

So  NASA  has  to  move  ahead  with  Orion  deliberately,  but  also  cautiously,  and
Congress  has  to  keep  a  keen  and  constant  eye  on  the  project.  Neither  the  Agency
nor the Nation can afford another Space Station—a project that, for all its technical
magnificence,  has  seen  its  costs  balloon  while  its  capabilities  shrank  to  near  the
vanishing point.

This  may  very  well  be  my  last  hearing  on  NASA,  but  I  hope  we  will  have  set  a
pattern  of  friendly,  but  rigorous  vigilance  that  will  be  continued  as  the  Nation
moves ahead with work on returning to the Moon.

I  am  pleased  to  say  that  NASA  itself  also  seems  to  be  operating  at  a  high  level
of  vigilance.  The  agency  is  trying  to  base  Orion  on  technologies  that  have  already
been  used  successfully  in  other  programs.  And  I  am  very  glad  to  see  that  NASA
modified the Lockheed Martin contract for Orion as a result of the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) study this committee requested.

That  is  a  great  example  of  how  sensible  oversight  can  work  to  the  advantage  of
the Agency being reviewed, and frankly it’s a credit to this committee, to GAO and
to NASA that the contract was modified.

But  that  hardly  closes  the  issues  before  us.  GAO  correctly  points  out  that  NASA
does  not  yet  have  a  final  design  or  cost  estimate  for  Orion.  That’s  not  a  criticism
of  NASA;  that’s  just  where  we  are  in  the  process,  and  Congress  has  to  recognize
how fluid the situation is—although far less fluid than at this time last year.

GAO  believes  that  NASA  should  not  have  let  as  extensive  a  contract  as  it  did,
given the uncertainties, and they make a plausible case. NASA has made reasonable
arguments  in  response,  and  the  contract  has  been  let,  so  we  don’t  have  to  rehash
that issue here.

What  we  do  have  to  learn  at  this  hearing  is:  what  should  Congress  be  doing  and
what  information  we  should  be  seeking  to  exercise  strict  oversight  as  this  project
moves  forward?  And,  what  additional  steps  should  NASA  be  taking  to  make  sure
that project costs do not escalate?

I look forward to getting answers to those key questions. We have the right folks
before us to get those answers, and I want to welcome Dr. Scott (Doc) Horowitz from
NASA for his first public appearance before the Committee. He meets with the staff
all the time, and hopefully we won’t be as hard on him today as they are.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I once tried out for my church choir, and I was quickly told that
I  had  such  a  bad  voice  that  I  was  not  even  able  to  make  a  joyful
Lord—noise to the Lord, so my birthday present to you today is not
to sing. Unfortunately, I can’t say that for Dana Rohrabacher. I am
not  sure  what  he  will  do,  but  we  do  wish  you  a  happy  birthday,
and we welcome our witnesses today.

First,  let  me  make  clear  what  this  hearing  is  not.  It  is  not  a
hearing  about  whether  or  not  the  Nation  should  build  a  Crew  Ex-
ploration Vehicle. It is not a hearing about whether or not the right
contractor  team  won  the  CEV  contract.  And  it  is  not  a  hearing
about whether or not the U.S. should return to the Moon. Instead,
this hearing is an examination of whether or not NASA is pursuing
the  right  acquisition  strategy  for  the  CEV,  whether  it  has  ade-
quately  planned  for  the  challenges  inherent  in  the  program,  and
whether it has budgeted sufficient funds to complete the CEV. The
last  question  is  particularly  important  because  if  there  is  cost
growth in the CEV program, it has the potential to do serious dam-

41

age to NASA’s other programs, as well as other parts of the explo-
ration initiative.

I don’t want to see that happen. I want to see the CEV program
succeed,  and  that  is  why  I  was  very  concerned  when  the  GAO  re-
ported  to  Chairman  Boehlert  and  I  in  late  July  that,  and  I  quote
‘‘NASA’s current acquisition strategy for the CEV places the project
at  risk  of  significant  cost  overruns,  schedule  delays,  and  perform-
ance shortfalls.’’

Equally  troubling  were  GAO’s  findings  on  the  issues  of  whether
NASA’s  overall  exploration  architectural  costs  estimates  fit  within
the Agency’s projected available budget. Once again, to quote GAO,
‘‘There are years when NASA does not have sufficient funding to—
funds to implement the architecture. Some yearly shortfalls exceed
$1 billion, while in other years the funding available exceeds need-
ed  resources.’’  And 
‘‘NASA’s  preliminary  projections—projects
multi-billion  dollar  shortfalls  for  the  Exploration  System  Mission
Directorate  in  all  fiscal  years  2014  through  2020.’’  In  other  words,
we may be seeing another example of lofty goals being set without
those  proposals—without  those  proposing  them  identifying  where
resources  needed  to  achieve  these  goals  will  be  coming  from  in  fu-
ture years.

I  want  to  note,  of  course,  that  NASA  non-concurred  with  GAO’s
findings  and  believes  that  it  has  a  good  plan  for  both  the  CEV  ac-
quisition  and  the  overall  exploration  program.  I  would  caution,
however,  that  those  are  words  we  have  heard  before.  I  would  re-
mind  my  colleagues  that  some  18  months  ago,  NASA  testified  be-
fore this committee about its plans for acquiring a CEV, indicating
that it had a well thought out approach to the CEV program.

Let me offer a quote from NASA’s February 16, 2005, testimony.
‘‘The  CEV  will  be  developed  in  a  spiral  approach  wherein  early
demonstrations  and  prototypes  are  used  to  demonstrate  capabili-
ties,  validate  technologies,  and  mitigate  risk,  all  along  an  evolu-
tionary path toward a mature design. The first spiral development
plan will provide the capacity to deliver humans to orbit in a CEV
by the year 2014.’’

Now,  as  you  recall,  last  year’s  approach  was  going  to  maintain
a competition between two contractor teams until 2008 when there
would a competitive ‘‘fly-off’’ prior to the award of the CEV develop-
ment  contract.  NASA  also  assured  Congress  last  year  that  CEV
and  the  CLV  acquisition  plan  would  be  within  budget  that  would
meet the 2014 timeframe.

It is now 2006. NASA has eliminated the spiral development ap-
proach, has decided not to maintain the competitive fly-off, and has
added  almost  $7  billion  to  the  CEV  and  CLV  program  relative  to
what  last  year’s  five-year  funding  plan  said  would  be  needed.  And
after  all  of  that,  NASA  is  indicating  that  CEV  still  will  not  enter
operational service until 2014, due to budgetary constraints.

My  intent  in  reciting  this  history  is  not  to  embarrass  NASA;  it
is simply to make the point that we have received assurances from
this  agency  in  the  past  that  everything  is  under  control,  and  we
have  had  other  painful  reminders  in  recent  months  of  large-scale
acquisition programs in other agencies under our jurisdiction going
off course. We cannot afford to have that happen again.

Today’s hearing will provide an opportunity for the Committee to
hear  from  both  GAO  and  NASA  on  these  issues.  And  once  again,
as my friend Chairman Boehlert has pointed out, our concern here
is  that  if  things  get  out  of  kilter  even  with  the  best  intentions,  it
is going to result in potentially cannibalizing other programs with-
in NASA, which makes us lose support within Congress for NASA,
which  then  can  lead  to  appropriations  battles  where  they  could
take  some  of  this  out  of  our  hands.  That  is  not  where  we  want  to
be.  We  want  to  work  with  you  as  good  partners  to  try  to  alleviate
that, because we are all going to suffer if that is not the case.

And again, I welcome you here.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Good  afternoon.  I’d  like  to  join  the  Chairman  in  welcoming  the  witnesses  to  to-

day’s hearing.

First,  let  me  be  clear  about  what  this  hearing  is  not.  It  is  not  a  hearing  about
whether or not the Nation should build a Crew Exploration Vehicle. It is not a hear-
ing  about  whether  or  not  the  right  contractor  team  won  the  CEV  contract.  And  it
is not a hearing about whether or not the U.S. should return to the Moon.

Instead,  this  hearing  is  to  examine  whether  or  not  NASA  is  pursuing  the  right
acquisition  strategy  for  the  CEV,  whether  it  has  adequately  planned  for  the  chal-
lenges  inherent  in  the  program,  and  whether  it  has  budgeted  sufficient  funds  to
complete the CEV.

The last question is particularly important, because if there is cost growth in the
CEV  program,  it  has  the  potential  to  do  serious  damage  to  NASA’s  other  programs
as well as to other parts of the exploration initiative.

I  don’t  want  to  see  that  happen.  I  want  to  see  the  CEV  program  succeed.  That
is why I was very concerned when the GAO reported to Chairman Boehlert and me
in late July that: ‘‘NASA’s current acquisition strategy for the CEV places the project
at risk of significant cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls. . .’’
Equally troubling were GAO’s findings on the issue of whether NASA’s overall ex-
ploration  architecture  cost  estimates  fit  within  the  Agency’s  projected  available
budgets. To again quote GAO: ‘‘. . .there are years when NASA does not have suffi-
cient funding to implement the architecture. Some yearly shortfalls exceed $1 billion,
while in other years the funding available exceeds needed resources. . .’’

And,  ‘‘NASA  preliminarily  projects  multi-billion-dollar  shortfalls  for  [NASA’s]  Ex-

ploration System Mission Directorate in all fiscal years from 2014 to 2020.’’

In other words, we may be seeing another example of lofty goals being set without
those proposing them identifying where the resources needed to achieve those goals
will be coming from in future years.

I want to note, of course, that NASA ‘‘non-concurred’’ with the GAO’s findings and
believes that it has a good plan for both the CEV acquisition and the overall explo-
ration  program.  I  would  caution,  however,  that  those  are  words  we  have  heard  be-
fore.

I  would  remind  my  colleagues  that  some  18  months  ago,  NASA  testified  before
this committee about its plans for acquiring the CEV, indicating that it had a well-
thought-out approach to the CEV program.

Let  me  offer  a  quote  from  NASA’s  February  16,  2005  testimony:  ‘‘[The  CEV]  will
be developed in a ‘spiral’ approach, wherein early demonstrations and prototypes are
used  to  demonstrate  capabilities,  validate  technologies,  and  mitigate  risk,  all  along
an  evolutionary  path  toward  a  mature  design.  The  first  spiral  development  planned
will provide the capability to deliver humans to orbit in a CEV by 2014.’’

As  you  will  recall,  last  year’s  approach  was  going  to  maintain  a  competition  be-
tween  two  contractor  teams  until  2008  when  there  would  be  a  competitive  ‘‘fly-off’’
prior to award of the CEV development contract.

NASA also assured the Congress last year that its CEV and CLV acquisition plan

came with a budget that would meet its 2014 timetable.

It’s now 2006. NASA has eliminated the spiral development approach, has decided
not to maintain the competitive fly-off, and has added almost $7 billion to the CEV
and  CLV  program  relative  to  what  last  year’s  five-year  funding  plan  said  would  be
needed.  And  after  all  of  that,  NASA  is  indicating  that  the  CEV  still  will  not  enter
operational service until 2014 due to budgetary constraints.

My intent in reciting this history is not to embarrass NASA—it is simply to make
the point that we have received assurances from this agency in the past that ‘‘every-
thing  is  under  control’’  and  we  have  had  other  painful  reminders  in  recent  months
of large-scale acquisition programs in other agencies under our jurisdiction going off
course. We cannot afford to have that happen again.

Today’s  hearing  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  the  Committee  to  hear  from  both

GAO and NASA on these issues. I look forward to their testimony

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon.
Now,  for  the  distinguished  Chairman  of  the  Subcommittee,  Mr.

Calvert.

Mr.  CALVERT.  I  thank  the  gentleman,  and  I,  too,  want  to  share
with  my  colleague  on  the  other  side,  bid  you  birthday  wishes.
Happy  birthday.  Happy  70th  birthday.  My  goodness,  that  is  great.
I want to say from the bottom of my heart, surely——

Chairman BOEHLERT. I should note parenthetically that Mr. Gor-

don, on the side, said, ‘‘I wasn’t going to mention that.’’

Mr. CALVERT. Hey, we all want to make it. I don’t know if I will
ever  make  it.  But  it  has  been  a  great  six  years  with  you  here  as
Chairman.  This  institution  will  be  less  of  a  place  when  you  retire.
I  think  that  you  have  done  a  fantastic  job  here.  It  has  really  been
a pleasure serving with you, and I want you to know that.

NASA,  as  you  know,  has  undertaken  the  first  steps  of  an  explo-
ration program that will continue over the next several decades. It
will inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, just as
Apollo inspired an earlier generation in the 1960s. Two major con-
tracts  recently  awarded  are  moving  us,  I  think,  in  the  right  direc-
tion. The Space Shuttle has completed its third flight since the Co-
lumbia  disaster,  and  we  are  now  on  a  path  to  complete  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station.  The  Commercial  Orbital  Transportation
Services  Award  recently  had  been  awarded  to  Space  X  and
Rocketplane  Kistler.  Both  of  these  entrepreneurial  companies  are
developing logistics systems to service the International Space Sta-
tion,  while  on  a  parallel  plane,  the  Lockheed  Martin  company  will
be  developing  a  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  or  Orion,  to  explore  the
Moon, Mars, and beyond.

I  want  to  applaud  NASA  for  their  timely  schedule  of  procure-
ment  for  this  major  undertaking.  The  two  procurement  announce-
ment,  or  the  first  of  several  major  procurement  award  announce-
ments,  were  made  in  order  to  achieve  the  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration.  I  am  certainly  pleased  that  the  Committee  was  the  first  to
endorse  the  Vision  when  we  unanimously  passed  the  NASA  Au-
thorization of 2005 last July. The Congress overwhelmingly passed
the Authorization last year, and now NASA is carrying out the will
of  the  Congress.  Many  of  the  overall  decisions  for  the  Vision  have
been  made:  a  capsule  approach  for  the  Crew  Vehicle  to  minimize
a  technical  risk  and  maximize  crew  safety;  a  launch  vehicle  that
builds on the Space Shuttle technology of upper stage engine derive
that  was  used  on  Saturn  V,  and  a  main  engine  currently  used  on
Delta IV.

It seems that all of these programs contribute to the knowledge-
based  approach  that  is  laid  out  by  the  GAO.  I  believe  NASA  has
a  more  advanced  state  of  knowledge  than  the  Agency  has  had  for
many of their earlier procurements. In addition, the NASA acquisi-
tion strategy for the Vision is more flexible and has built in incen-

44

tives, options, and provisions for termination if necessary. The aim
is to improve contractor performance.

I  know  how  tight  the  development  budgets  will  be  for  this  pro-
gram.  I  am  concerned  that  some  of  these  recommendations  could
impose delays, resulting in substantial cost increases. Congress will
continue  to  exercise  its  oversight  responsibility  on  this  program,
just  as  we  are  today.  However,  we  cannot  analyze  the  program  to
death.  We  must  move  forward,  stabilize  requirements,  maintain  a
tight  design  and  development  schedule  to  minimize  the  gap  be-
tween the Shuttle retirement and the operational Crew Exploration
Vehicle,  and  bring  Orion  online  within  the  allowed  or  allocated
budget.

I  know  that  NASA  and  these  contractors  have  brought  in  the
best minds to work on this program. We now have an exciting pro-
gram  for  NASA  to  carry  out,  and  for  the  next  generation  to  aspire
to  to  be  a  part.  The  decision  has  been  made  to  move  forward,  and
we  need  to  let  NASA  and  the  United  States  lead  the  world  in  our
exploration of space.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Calvert follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN KEN CALVERT

NASA is undertaking the first steps of an exploration program that will continue
over  several  decades.  It  will  inspire  the  next  generation  of  scientists  and  engineers
just  as  Apollo  inspired  an  earlier  generation  in  the  ’60s.  Two  major  contracts  re-
cently  awarded  are  moving  us  in  the  right  direction.  The  Space  Shuttle  has  com-
pleted  its  third  flight  since  the  Columbia  disaster  and  we  are  now  on  the  path  to
complete the International Space Station.

The  Commercial  Orbital  Transportation  Services  awards  recently  have  been
awarded to SpaceX and to Rocketplane/Kistler. Both entrepreneurial companies are
developing  a  logistics  system  to  service  the  International  Space  Station,  while  on  a
parallel  plane,  the  Lockheed  Martin  Company  will  be  developing  the  Crew  Explo-
ration Vehicle, or Orion, to explore the Moon, Mars and beyond.

I  applaud  NASA  for  their  timely  schedule  of  procurement  for  this  major  under-
taking. The two procurement announcements are the first of several major procure-
ment  award  announcements  that  will  be  made  in  order  to  achieve  the  Vision  for
Space  Exploration.  I  am  pleased  the  Committee  was  the  first  to  endorse  the  Vision
when  we  unanimously  passed  the  NASA  Authorization  of  2005  last  July.  The  Con-
gress overwhelmingly passed the Authorization late last year and now NASA is car-
rying out the will of the Congress.

Many of the overall decisions for the Vision have been made—a capsule approach
for  the  crew  vehicle  to  minimize  technical  risk  and  to  maximize  crew  safety;  a
launch  vehicle  that  builds  on  the  Space  Shuttle  technology;  an  upper  stage  engine
derived  from  that  used  on  the  Saturn  V;  and  a  main  engine  currently  used  on  the

proach, as laid out by the GAO. I believe NASA has a more advanced state of knowl-
edge  than  the  Agency  has  had  for  many  of  their  earlier  procurements.  In  addition,
the NASA acquisition strategy for the Vision is more flexible and has built in incen-
tives,  options,  and  provisions  for  termination  if  necessary.  The  aim  is  to  improve
contractor performance.

I  know  how  tight  the  development  budgets  will  be  for  this  program  and  am  con-
cerned  that  some  of  these  recommendations  could  impose  delays  resulting  in  sub-
stantial  cost  increases.  Congress  will  continue  to  exercise  its  oversight  responsibil-
ities  on  this  program,  just  as  we  are  today.  However,  we  cannot  analyze  the  pro-
gram  to  death.  We  must  move  forward  and  stabilize  the  requirements;  maintain  a
tight design and development schedule to minimize the gap between the Shuttle re-
tirement and an operational Crew Exploration Vehicle; and bring Orion online with-
in the allocated budget.

I  know  that  NASA  and  its  contractors  have  brought  in  their  best  minds  to  work
on  this  program.  We  now  have  an  exciting  program  for  NASA  to  carry  out  and  for
our  next  generation  to  aspire  to  be  a  part  of.  The  decision  has  been  made  to  move

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairman  Calvert.
Mr. Udall.
Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  In  the  spirit  of  Mr.  Gor-
don  and  Mr.  Calvert’s  remarks,  I  would  also  like  to  make  a  brief
comment  about  your  tenure  and  your  friendship  and  your  leader-
ship.  It  has  been  said  that  a  statesman  is  a  dead  politician,  and
somebody said that, yeah, we need more statesmen. I think you are
in  a  quasi-statesman  category  today,  and  soon  after  you  leave  the
House, you will be known as a full statesman for the way you con-
ducted yourself, the leadership particularly on this committee. I am
particularly indebted to you for your hard work on behalf of energy
independence, doing something about climate change, I think looms
as one of the biggest challenges facing not only our country, but the
world, and you will be sorely missed.

I,  too,  want  to  welcome  all—the  two  witnesses  today  here.  We

have got a lot to cover so I will be very brief.

I  want  to  mention  that  I  am  encouraged  that  the  recent  CEV
contract was by all accounts the result of a hard-fought competition
between  the  two  high-quality  contractor  teams,  and  I  did  want  to
congratulate Lockheed Martin, which coincidentally is based in my
home State of Colorado, on winning that competition.

I  would  also  like  to  echo  the  comments  made  by  Ranking  Mem-
ber  Gordon,  and  I  am,  of  course,  troubled  by  the  issues  raised  by
the  GAO  in  their  July  17  report.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  both
from the GAO and NASA today.

Given  the  importance  of  the  CEV  program  to  the  future  of  the
Nation’s human space flight activities, I think it is imperative that
this committee engage in sustained, serious oversight of it, as well
as  the  other  parts  of  NASA’s  exploration  initiative  to  ensure  that
they  are  carried  out  in  an  efficient  and  responsible  manner.  I  say
this not because I have any concerns about the dedication and com-
mitment  of  NASA  and  the  contractor  team  to  the  success  of  the
program; rather, it is because from my vantage point on the Armed
Services  Committee,  I  have  seen  that  dedication  and  commitment
are by themselves are not sufficient to keep major systems acquisi-
tions  from  sometimes  running  into  trouble.  We  all  know  examples
of  important  programs  that  have  gotten  off  track  and  suffered  sig-
nificant cost growth and schedule delays.

As  the  GAO  has  pointed  out  other  occasions  ‘‘Good  intentions
aren’t enough.’’ There also needs to be a clear understanding of re-
quirements,  credible  costs,  and  scheduled  estimates  and  a  dis-
ciplined approach to program management. All of us want NASA’s
CEV  program  to  succeed,  and  in  that  spirit,  I  believe  that  today’s
hearing  can  provide  a  forum  for  a  constructive  review  of  NASA’s
plans.

And again, I look forward to hearing from our two esteemed wit-

nesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MARK UDALL

Good  afternoon.  I’d  like  to  join  my  colleagues  in  welcoming  our  witnesses  to  to-
day’s hearing. We have a lot of issues to cover today, so I will just make a few obser-
vations.

First,  I  am  encouraged  that  the  recent  CEV  contract  award  was  by  all  accounts
the  result  of  a  hard-fought  competition  between  two  high-quality  contractor  teams.
And I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Lockheed Martin team—
which  coincidentally  is  based  in  my  home  State  of  Colorado—on  winning  that  com-
petition.

Second,  I  want  to  echo  the  comments  made  by  Ranking  Member  Gordon.  I  am,
of  course,  troubled  by  the  issues  raised  by  the  GAO  in  their  July  17th  report,  and
I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  both  GAO  and  NASA  today  about  what  has  been
done to address those issues.

Given  the  importance  of  the  CEV  program  to  the  future  of  the  Nation’s  human
space  flight  activities,  I  think  it’s  imperative  that  this  committee  engage  in  sus-
tained,  serious  oversight  of  it,  as  well  as  the  other  parts  of  NASA’s  exploration  ini-
tiative,  to  ensure  that  they  are  carried  out  in  an  efficient  and  responsible  manner.
I say this not because I have any concerns about the dedication and commitment

of NASA and the contractor team to the success of the exploration program.

Rather,  it’s  because  from  my  vantage  point  on  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  I
have seen that dedication and commitment are by themselves not sufficient to keep
major systems acquisitions from sometimes running into trouble.

We  all  know  of  examples  of  important  programs  that  have  gotten  off  track  and

suffered significant cost growth and schedule delays.

As  the  GAO  has  pointed  out  on  other  occasions,  ‘‘good  intentions’’  aren’t

enough. . .

There  also  needs  to  be  a  clear  understanding  of  requirements,  credible  cost  and

schedule estimates, and a disciplined approach to program management.

We  all  want  NASA’s  CEV  program  to  succeed.  I  hope  that  today’s  hearing  can
provide  a  forum  for  a  constructive  review  of  NASA’s  plans,  and  I  look  forward  to
hearing from our witnesses.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
The  Chair,  as  a  point  of  personal  request,  recognizes  Mr.  Rohr-

abacher.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Before you get away, I want to thank you for
all  the  great  times  we  have  had  here  and  the  intellectual,  I  might
say, stimulation that we have had on so many—exploring so many
areas that they themselves are interesting, but it is also interesting
how  different  approaches  can  be  an  exciting  way  to  actually  look
at  our  potential.  So  happy  birthday  to  the  Chairman.  Also,  I  want
to  note  that  in  the  future,  and  as  you  move  on  and  you  are  not
here,  every  time  I  start  talking  about  global  warming  I  will  look
in front of me and I will see your skeptical face there on that paint-
ing  and  it  will  remind  me  of  some  of  these  great  discussions  that
we have had.

Finally,  on  our  issue  for  today,  let  me  just  say  that  we  have  be-
hind us—your face is in front of us, but behind us we still have this
slogan that says ‘‘Where there is no vision, the people will perish.’’
There  is  an  actual—that  is  not  the  end  of  the  quote,  interestingly
enough.  The  other  part  of  the  quote  goes  ‘‘Where  there  is  no
prioritization, there is only failure.’’ I would hope people know that
you  can  fail  by  not  trying  to  do  enough,  but  most  of  the  time  we
fail—and  my  experience  is  that  we  have  failed  because  we  have
tried  to  do  everything  for  everybody.  And  the  President  laid  down
a  plan,  a  game  plan,  a  priority  of  this—of  a  lunar  approach  first,
a  lunar  goal,  and  I  think  we—that  we  now  have  in  front  of  us  the
first  manifestation  of  that  prioritization  of  goals,  and  I  am  very
pleased that the Administration is doing this in a cost effective way
by  trying  to  use  older  technology,  meaning  technology  that  is  al-
ready  proven,  and  putting  it  together  in  new  sources  of  rockets,  et
cetera.

And  with  that  said,  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  all  of  your
leadership. We will miss you and I will miss some of our back and
forths.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Can  I  tell  them  about  the  secret  gift  you
gave me? He gave me a birthday card and said, ‘‘You know, I think
maybe  we  ought  to  look  at  global  warming.’’  It  is  for  real,  but
thank  you  very  much.  I  thank  all  my  colleagues.  You  have  been
very kind and it is a pleasure to work with all of you.

I  would  remind  one  and  all  we  have  another  hearing  tomorrow,

so polish up your rhetoric. We will have another opportunity.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good  afternoon.  I  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  appearing  before  the  Com-
mittee  to  examine  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration’s  (NASA)  devel-
opment strategy for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) in light of the recent report
issued  by  the  Government  Accountability  Office  (GAO)  expressing  concerns  over
NASA’s ability to budget for the CEV program.

In  January  2004,  President  Bush  announced  his  Vision  for  Space  Exploration
(VSE)  which  include  key  human  space  flight  milestones,  such  as  retirement  of  the
Space Shuttle in 2010, completion of the International Space Station (ISS), and de-
velopment of a new CEV, known as Orion. According to NASA, Orion will help fur-
ther  our  understanding  of  Earth,  the  solar  system,  the  universe,  and  the  origins  of
life itself.

On  July  17,  2006  GAO  issued  a  report  expressing  their  serious  concerns  over
NASA’s  acquisition  of  Orion.  The  report  examines  whether  NASA’s  exploration  ini-
tiative estimated costs fit within the Agency’s projected available budgets and deter-
mined  that  NASA  will  be  significantly  challenged  to  meet  their  intended  goal.  The
recommendations  submitted  by  GAO  suggest  Congress  should  consider  restricting
annual  appropriations  and  limit  NASA’s  obligations  for  Orion  to  only  the  amount
of  funding  necessary  to  support  activities  needed  to  successfully  complete  the
project’s  preliminary  design  review.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  Dr.  Horowitz
from NASA and Mr. Allen from GAO on the exploration program.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Johnson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member.
NASA  is  especially  important  to  Texas.  Space  travel  has  sparked  the  minds  of
generations  of  Americans.  In  Texas,  it  has  meant  jobs  and  strong  local  economies.
I  recently  hosted  an  astronaut,  Ms.  Stephanie  D.  Wilson,  at  an  event  in  Wash-
ington. Just watching footage from Ms. Wilson’s time in a zero gravity environment
was incredible and inspiring.

We understand that NASA has had a challenging task to plan out the short- and
long-term  details  for  the  Orion  project.  It  is  in  our  interest  as  policy-makers  and
the interest of our constituents to stay engaged in the process.

As the Agency prepares to embark on a new journey with the Orion Crew Explo-
ration  Vehicle,  this  committee  wants  to  do  all  it  can  to  provide  support  so  that  the
initiative succeeds.

Since this is the first time the Full Committee on Science has interacted officially
with NASA since the last successful space launch, I extend warmest congratulations
on its success.

It  is  my  hope  that  this  strong  record  of  achievement  speak  for  the  public’s  con-

garded and respected General Accountability Office. Not only is the
office highly regarded and respected, so too are you, sir. Thank you.

Dr. Horowitz, you are up.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  SCOTT  J.  HOROWITZ,  ASSOCIATE  ADMIN-
ISTRATOR, EXPLORATION SYSTEMS MISSION DIRECTORATE,
NATIONAL  AERONAUTICS  AND  SPACE  ADMINISTRATION
(NASA)
Dr. HOROWITZ. Thank you, sir.
Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,
and  Members  of  the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  here
today  to  testify  how  we  at  NASA  are  taking  the  first  step  in  turn-
ing the Vision for Space Exploration into reality with the Crew Ex-
ploration Vehicle called Orion.

First  of  all,  sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  this  committee,  especially
you, sir, for—and Member Gordon as well as Congressmen Calvert
and  Udall  for  your  vision  and  your  leadership  that  brought  us  the
NASA Authorization Act of 2005. Chairman, I couldn’t help but no-
tice  your  new  picture  here  on  the  wall,  and  I  know  it  is  a  great
honor, only second to if it was hanging in the Hall of Fame. I know
that this Act is going to be an important part of your legacy.

For  years,  NASA  struggled  with  a  lack  of  clear  guidance.
Through your efforts, we now have a clear set goals and objectives
to  focus  the  great  talents  of  our  NASA  team.  This  law  provides
clear  guidance  for  Aeronautics,  Science,  Space  Ops,  and  Explo-
ration.  For  human  space  flight,  we  now  have  clear,  concise  direc-
tion:  finish  the  International  Space  Station,  retire  the  Space  Shut-
tle,  develop  a  Shuttle-derived  transportation  system  that  will  be
operational  by  2014,  and  give  us  the  capability  to  go  back  to  the
Moon  by  2020.  These  are  the  first  steps  to  creating  a  sustained
human presence on the Moon in preparations for journeys to Mars
and beyond.

Mr.  Chairman,  NASA  engineers  have  done  too  much  view  graph
engineering  in  the  all  too  recent  past.  As  a  rocket  scientist,  astro-
naut,  test  pilot,  and  experimental  aircraft  builder,  I  can  tell  you
there’s  nothing  better  than  hands-on  experience.  Sir,  it  is  time  for
NASA  to  put  down  the  view  graphs  and  get  our  hands  dirty.  It  is
time  to  start  designing,  building,  and  testing  real  flight  hardware,
and we are.

Let  me  share  with  you  some  of  the  accomplishments  so  far  this
year.  We  have  successfully  accomplished  two  Space  Shuttle  mis-
sions to the ISS and are finishing its assembly. We said at the be-
ginning of the year that we would complete the competition for the
Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  and  also  enter  into  funded  Space  Act
Agreements to demonstrate commercial crew and cargo services for
the ISS. On August 18, we signed two Space Act Agreements with
Space  X  and  Rocketplane  Kistler  to  demonstrate  the  commercially
operated  transportation  services.  On  August  31,  we  awarded  a
major contract to Lockheed Martin for the design and development
of  Orion.  We  are  well  on  our  way  to  developing  the  Ares  I  launch
vehicle,  with  development  of  the  first  stage  underway,  and  the  J–
2X  second  stage  engine  program  off  and  running.  We  have  con-
structed  and  conducted  Orion  body  mass  drop  tests  at  Langley,
thermal protection systems arc jet tests at Ames, wind tunnel tests

and engine tests at Marshall. This week at Kennedy Space Center,
we completed industry and global assessments on launch and oper-
ations to reduce future infrastructure and ops costs.

Some major milestones for you to keep your eyes open for in the
future  are  in  2008.  We  will  launch  the  lunar  robotic  orbiter  being
developed  at  Goddard,  and  it  will  have  its  secondary  payload,
Lunar  CRater  Observation  and  Sensing  Satellite  (LCROSS),  being
developed  at  Ames.  We  are  30  months  away  from  the  first  launch
of  a  full-scale  test  article  of  the  Ares  I,  scheduled  for  early  2009.
Mr. Chairman, in your invitation letter, you asked me to specifi-
cally  address  two  questions.  One,  how  will  NASA  strategy  reduce
the  total  cost  for  production  and  operations  of  the  Orion  Crew  Ex-
ploration  Vehicle,  and  two,  what  actions  have  we  taken  to  address
concerns raised by the GAO?

First, the most important factor that will reduce the total cost for
production  in  operations  of  Orion  is  its  simplicity.  The  Ares  I
launch  vehicle  and  Orion  spacecraft  are  far  simpler  designs  than
the  Space  Shuttle,  and  thus  will  need  few  engineers  and  techni-
cians to design, develop, test, and operate. There are no exotic tech-
nologies  or  evolutionary  designs  required  to  accomplish  our  mis-
sion.

We  take  the  GAO  concerns  quite  seriously,  and  have  had  our
team  meet  with  GAO,  and  Mr.  Li  and  I  have  personally  met.  We
are  implementing  our  management  approach  dictated  by  NASA
program  guidance  7120.5,  which 
incorporates  the  GAO  rec-
ommendations  on  implementing  a  knowledge-based  acquisition
framework.  Also,  based  on  our  discussions,  we  have  made  some
modifications to our contract with Lockheed Martin, the most nota-
ble  being  the  use  of  options  which  preserve  NASA’s  flexibility  in
case  of  any  unforeseen  trouble.  We  have  the  knowledge  and  tech-
nical  framework  to  move  forward.  The  consolation  program,  our
NASA  Smart  Buyer  team,  Lockheed  Martin,  and  Northrop  Grum-
man  Boeing  teams  all  completed  initial  designs  based  on  our  re-
quirements.  If  you  were  to  place  a  model  of  each  of  these  designs
on the table, except for the shape of the solar rays, you couldn’t tell
the  difference.  The  largest  change  in  a  year  we  have  made  to  the
vehicle  is  we  shrunk  it  from  five  and  a  half  meters  to  five  meters,
about this much. That is the largest change we have made.

We know what we need to do; it is time to execute.
In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to share with you how im-
portant  this  challenge  is  to  me  personally,  because  it  reflects  how
many  of  us  at  NASA  feel.  February  1,  2003,  was  the  darkest  day
of my NASA career. When the Space Shuttle Columbia didn’t come
home, I lost seven friends. I spent the next several months in East-
ern  Texas  helping  with  the  recovery  efforts,  and  in  the  back  room
of  our  control  center,  myself  and  several  of  my  fellow  astronauts
wondered  if  the  United  States  might  stop  exploring  space  alto-
gether, and what would that mean to our nation’s future.

It  was  there  that  the  initial  design  concepts  were  born  that
would  allow  us  to  send  astronauts  to  space  with  more  reliability
and safety. The risks are worth the rewards. Every person that has
ever  strapped  themselves  to  the  top  of  a  rocket  understands  this.
We  need  to  learn  from  our  past  and  not  become  complacent  about
the  costs  and  risks  involved  in  human  space  flight.  Fortunately,

our  nation’s  leaders  recognize  this  as  well  and  understand  the  im-
portance of worthy goals for our space program. Mr. Chairman, we
have a lot of work ahead of us, and we have the team in place who
remembers  the  lessons  from  that  dark  day  and  have  dedicated
themselves to this most noble of causes.

Again, thank you for your leadership and support of our nation’s

space program, and I look forward to your questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF SCOTT J. HOROWITZ

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
appear  before  you  today  to  outline  NASA’s  progress  in  developing  Orion,  the  Na-
tion’s next-generation piloted spacecraft.

In  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155),  the  Congress  provided  a
national framework that supports and expands upon the Administration’s Vision for
Space  Exploration.  These  policy  pillars  are  helping  to  shape,  align,  and  focus
NASA’s  human  exploration  and  robotic  activities.  With  this  foundation,  NASA  now
has  a  broad,  future-focused  context  for  its  low-Earth  orbit  activities.  These  include
flying  the  Space  Shuttle  safely  until  its  2010  retirement  and  completing  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station  (ISS)  in  order  to  advance  science,  exploration,  and  inter-
national  collaboration.  NASA  is  also  now  taking  the  initial  steps  to  extend  human-
ity’s presence across the solar system by moving beyond our beachhead in space on
the ISS. We will return to the Moon by the end of the next decade to live and work
on  a  sustained  basis  to  meet  a  range  of  objectives,  including  the  preparation  for
journeys to Mars and beyond.

A sustained presence on the Moon will advance U.S. preeminence, commerce and
science,  and  prepare  us  for  future  expeditions  outside  Earth’s  immediate  neighbor-
hood.  I  am  honored  and  humbled  to  represent  such  a  noble,  important,  and  far-
reaching  effort.  It  taps  into  a  natural  curiosity  about  space,  stirs  our  imagination,
and  stimulates  creativity  and  productivity.  It  is  a  program  that  will  make  a  dif-
ference in our lives, on our planet, and to our children’s children’s future.
Time to Put the Viewgraphs Down and Get Going

In  August  of  this  year,  NASA  took  a  major  step  to  maintain  the  Nation’s  leader-
ship  position  in  space  when  it  awarded  to  Lockheed  Martin  Corporation  a  contract
to  design  and  develop  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  now  dubbed  Orion.  The  con-
tract took effect on September eighth. Named for one of the brightest and most rec-
ognizable  star  formations  in  the  sky,  Orion  is  the  central  member  of  a  family  of
spacecraft  and  launchers  that  NASA’s  Constellation  Program  is  developing  for  the
next  generation  of  explorers.  Two  industry  teams,  Lockheed  Martin  and  a  consor-
tium  of  Northrop  Grumman  and  Boeing,  spent  13  months  refining  concepts,  ana-
lyzing requirements, and refining the design for Orion.

Orion represents the culmination of literally decades of hardware heritage, design,
and  trades.  We  now  have  the  opportunity  to  develop  a  system  with  greater  safety,
reliability, capability, and affordability than the Space Shuttle. The Columbia trag-
edy  and  the  earlier  Challenger  tragedy  clarified  the  need  to  address  these  issues
and form a national context where our human space flight capabilities can be openly
addressed.  Thank  you  for  providing  a  national  framework  in  which  to  begin  to  im-
plement  our  dreams  and  build  upon  the  sacrifice  of  our  colleagues.  We  already  are
working  hard  on  this  transition  from  our  current  capabilities  into  the  capabilities
of the future.

Astronauts  will  have  a  less  risky  ride  to  and  from  space  aboard  Orion.  While  all
space flight involves risk, if we are to explore, we must reduce the risk of launching
below  the  current  level.  This  new  crew  module  is  inherently  safer  than  the  Shuttle
because  it  will  be  placed  on  top  of  its  booster.  This  will  protect  it  from  potentially
deadly launch system debris during ascent, and allows the addition of an abort sys-
tem that can separate capsule and crew from the booster in an emergency.

Orion  is  the  next-generation  piloted  spacecraft.  For  missions  to  the  Moon,  Orion
will  carry  up  to  four  astronauts  to  low-Earth  orbit  and,  once  there,  link  up  with  a
lunar  surface  access  module  for  the  trip  to  lunar  orbit.  The  access  module  will  de-
scend  to  the  Moon’s  surface  for  up  to  a  week  for  sortie  missions  and  up  to  six
months  for  outpost  missions,  while  Orion  orbits,  awaiting  its  return.  The  two  vehi-
cles  will  link  up  again  at  the  end  of  the  surface  mission,  and  the  astronauts  will
ride  back  to  Earth  in  Orion.  The  capsule  will  re-enter  the  atmosphere  and  descend
on  parachutes  back  to  Earth.  Orion  also  has  the  capability  to  service  the  ISS  as  a

backup  to  commercial  crew  and  cargo  delivery  services  now  in  development  for  the
ISS. Orion will be capable of transporting crew to and from the ISS and staying for
six months as a rescue vehicle.
Knowledge-Based Acquisition for a Path from the Past to the Future

Unlike NASA’s past space vehicle efforts, such as the National Aero-Space Plane,
X–33,  and  Orbital  Space  Plane,  which  focused  on  pushing  technology  and  relied  on
numerous advances and breakthroughs, Orion is designed and focused on achieving
clear  national  goals  based  on  known  technology  and  using  an  integrated  manage-
ment approach.

Our approach to Orion mirrors NASA’s overall focus on technical competence and
excellence in our workforce and in project development and oversight. NASA is plac-
ing greater emphasis on reliability in its systems and increasing the amount of up-
front analysis that goes into concept definition to ensure that top-level requirements
are  known  and  achievable.  We  recognize  that  our  systems  like  Orion  will  operate
over  decades  and  in  different  flight  regimes.  Therefore,  we  have  decided  to  insert
low-risk and mature technologies into the process but also allow for the introduction
of new technology that can mature quickly. Orion resembles Apollo for good reason.
Relying  on  proven  technology  for  our  lunar  return  increases  the  likelihood  of  suc-
cess.  Although  Orion  borrows  its  shape  and  aerodynamic  performance  from  Apollo,
the new capsule’s updated computers, electronics, life support, propulsion, and heat
protection systems represent a marked improvement over legacy systems. Our tech-
nology program is tightly coupled with the Constellation Program and it is essential
to  keeping  our  long-term  risk  and  life  cycle  costs  within  bounds.  Because  of  its  im-
portance to overall exploration program risk and our ability to meet national goals,
we  ask  that  you  support  full  funding  for  our  technology  program’s  budget.  We  are
working  on  a  range  of  technologies,  such  as  cryogenic  storage  and  hydrogen  fuel
cells, that will make a big impact on our programs and may have valuable applica-
tions outside of the space program.

NASA is working to ensure that initial investments lead to an Orion system that
supports  multiple  applications  with  low  recurring  operations  and  life  cycle  costs.
Since  recurring  infrastructure  costs  have  a  substantial  effect  on  life  cycle  costs,  se-
lection  of  the  Orion  launch  vehicle,  the  Ares  I,  was  influenced  greatly  by  the  con-
tractor’s  ability  to  minimize  infrastructure  and  associated  manpower  requirements.
Technology maturation activities by our research and technology development pro-
grams  will  further  improve  reliability,  reduce  life  cycle  costs,  and  increase  the  an-
ticipated effectiveness of future exploration systems. Also critical to cost control will
be  the  development  of  a  versatile  human-rated  launch  system.  The  Orion/Ares  de-
sign  will  serve  as  an  anchor  for  NASA’s  transportation  architecture,  which  itself  is
intended  to  enable  exploration  involving  multiple  destinations  and  diverse  objec-
tives. The architecture will be able to grow so that it can perform multiple functions.
The  overall  crew  transportation  system  that  will  evolve  from  the  basic  design  will
enable  ascent  and  entry  in  Earth’s  atmosphere,  transit  in  Earth  orbit  and  through
deep space, and operations at multiple locations including the Moon and Mars.

Orion  embodies  a  new  generation  of  systems  but  it  will  be  built  upon  the  tried-
and-true engineering of the past. We evaluated literally thousands of configurations
and  transportation  options  before  settling  on  Orion’s  design.  The  Orion  contract  is
a  continuation  of  these  analyses,  requirements,  architecture,  and  conceptual  design
work.  Orion  will  enable  space  operations  by  U.S.  astronauts  on  the  Moon  and  else-
where  in  the  solar  system.  As  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  also  directed,
we now have a very capable transportation architecture that infuses Shuttle-derived
hardware  and  capabilities  where  appropriate.  As  a  four-time  space  flyer,  personal
aircraft  builder  and  flyer,  and  holder  of  a  Ph.D.  in  aerospace  engineering  from  the
Georgia  Institute  of  Technology,  I  am  confident  in  the  design  we  have  chosen.  This
is  not  a  technology  dependent  program.  This  is  still  rocket  science—but  rocket
science we know and understand.
Orion Contract Approach and Strategy

The  acquisition  strategy  for  Orion  and  other  projects  within  Exploration  Systems
need  to  match  the  bold  and  forward-thinking  Vision  for  Space  Exploration.  Within
Exploration Systems we have laid out acquisition strategy tenets that were followed
for  the  Orion  contract.  One  of  these  tenets  is  to  maximize  competition.  From  our
recent  down-select  we  received  innovative  and  credible  approaches  with  financial
commitments  from  the  Lockheed  Martin  team  that  will  reap  benefits  for  NASA
through  the  entire  life  cycle  of  the  Orion  project.  Another  tenet  that  we  are  using
for  Orion  and  other  elements  of  the  Constellation  Program  is  to  utilize  current,
proven  technologies  that  will  lead  to  a  safer,  more  reliable  and  affordable  solution.
Because NASA defined the design concepts for development by both Phase One con-

52

tractors, both Prime Contractor teams were able to construct credible proposal esti-
mates.  Lockheed  Martin  will  take  these  concepts  to  the  next  stage  of  development.
For the Schedule A contract for the Design, Development, and Test and Evaluation
phase for Orion, NASA chose a cost-type contract, in which it accepts all of the cost
risks. We chose this type of contract in order for the contractor team to fully refine
the  design  and  test  the  vehicle  so  that  NASA  can  receive  a  reliable  and  affordable
space vehicle. What makes this cost risk acceptable is the fact that the NASA’s two
independent  efforts—one  performed  by  the  Constellation  Program  Office  and  the
other by the Smart Buyer team—included detailed preparatory work in its strategy
for  establishing  firm  requirements  at  the  beginning  of  the  contract.  The  ‘‘not  to  ex-
ceed’’  prices  for  the  Schedule  B  option  establishes  the  upper  level  of  the  contract
value  for  the  Agency  for  the  production  of  the  Orion  vehicles  to  meet  the  current
planned manifest. I would like to acknowledge Allen Li and his team at the Govern-
ment  Accountability  Office  for  pointing  out  the  potential  long-term  commitment  in
our  solicitation  which  resulted  in  NASA  making  options  of  both  Schedule  B  and  C
in the final contract.

NASA’s  acquisition  strategy  and  plan  for  selecting  a  Project  Orion  prime  con-
tractor  was  based  on  a  thorough  business  case  and  the  efforts  of  our  two  NASA
teams  that  developed  independent  designs.  We  were  intimately  familiar  with  both
proposal teams, having worked side-by-side with each of them for over a year under
Phase  1  contracts.  The  Orion  Project  will  establish  a  firm  foundation  for  the  Con-
stellation  Program.  The  Orion  acquisition  strategy  and  plan  focuses  on  gaining  in-
dustry’s  commitment  for  a  design  solution  and  controlling  life  cycle  cost  through
competition  and  incentives.  NASA  invested  more  than  $140  million  in  the  formula-
tion  phase  and  we  had  an  appropriate  level  of  knowledge  to  down-select  a  single
Project Orion prime contractor.

From  a  contract  oversight  perspective,  we  will  employ  a  number  of  measures  to
further guard against cost overruns. NASA based 25 percent of the award fee eval-
uation pool on project cost management. The project will employ earned value man-
agement, with cost and schedule performance measured against tasks. Progress will
be  measured  through  milestones  and  tests  on  a  schedule  determined  by  the  pro-
gram.  We  will  demonstrate  hardware  and  progress  on  Orion  through  an  exacting
test and demonstration schedule. Additionally, the Orion contract has an ‘‘end item’’
award fee feature that will be milestone based and focused on successful completion
of all elements of the design and initial production of the Orion vehicle. We believe
this  award  fee  feature  presents  an  opportunity  to  maximize  the  return  on  invest-
ment for both NASA and the Lockheed Martin team.

NASA’s  contract  with  Lockheed  Martin  maintains  the  longstanding  development
schedule for Orion. The initial flight test of an Orion prototype is targeted for 2008.
The first unpiloted flight of an actual capsule will follow in 2011, and the first flight
with humans aboard is to occur no later than 2014. Orion’s first Moon mission with
a crew will take place between 2015 and 2020.

The Orion Project organization was approved June 1, 2006, as a multi-center ‘‘vir-
tual’’  organization  that  leverages  the  Agency’s  technical  strengths.  Staffing  of  key
positions is complete. A Constellation tasks ‘‘roll out’’ to nine NASA Centers and the
Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  occurred  on  June  6,  2006.  The  NASA  centers  included
Ames, Glenn, Goddard, Langley, Kennedy, Marshall, Stennis, Johnson and Dryden.
Management  processes  are  maturing,  with  integrated  reporting  and  scheduling
processes  instituted  and  maturing;  boards,  panels,  and  working  groups  identified;
and configuration and risk management processes operating.
NASA Has Addressed the Findings of the GAO Report

NASA  has  reviewed  the  findings  in  the  GAO  Report  entitled  ‘‘NASA:  Long-Term
Commitment  to  and  Investment  in  Space  Exploration  Program  Requires  More
Knowledge.’’  We  have  non-concurred  with  a  key  finding  in  the  report  since  we  feel
we are meeting the concerns stipulated through our management framework, acqui-
sition approach, and our incentives to Lockheed Martin to meet performance, sched-
ule, and life cycle cost requirements. Also, as stated earlier, we are not seeking tech-
nological  miracles.  We  are  not  trying  to  violate  the  laws  of  physics—we  are  ready
to  build  a  spaceship  that  can  meet  our  current  national  needs  and  evolve  to  meet
our  future  needs.  However,  although  we  non-concurred  with  the  overall  report,  we
have implemented a number of the GAO’s recommendations.

NASA has learned and applied the best lessons from its past efforts. More impor-
tantly,  we  have  adopted  an  implementation  approach  that  is  technically  solid  and
well-managed. On the contract side, we have, after discussions with GAO, made the
Schedule  B  and  Schedule  C  portions  of  the  contract  into  options.  Phase  Two  pre-
serves NASA’s flexibility to terminate the contract at Orion’s preliminary design re-
view if cost projections are determined to be unaffordable and non-executable.

Progress  Report—Meeting  Commitments  and  Transitioning  Access  to  Low-

Earth Orbit

NASA  is  making  good  progress  on  the  national  objectives  Congress  has  laid  out
for  the  Agency.  Space  Shuttle  missions  STS–121  in  July  and  STS–115  this  month
brought us two steps closer to finishing assembly of the International Space Station
and meeting our partner commitments. We also are two steps closer to retiring the
Shuttle  in  2010.  The  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  is  working  to  create
greater service-based access to low-Earth orbit, to utilize the ISS for exploration re-
search  and  development,  and  to  foster  the  capabilities  necessary  to  sustain  human
presence on the lunar surface. In August, we entered into two unprecedented agree-
ments  with  Space  X  and  Rocketplane  Kistler  to  demonstrate,  based  on  milestone
performance,  cargo  and  crew  services  to  support  the  ISS.  We  are  very  hopeful  that
these and other nascent commercial space efforts will succeed so that NASA can in-
creasingly shift its focus and resources beyond low-Earth orbit. Once the commercial
sector  demonstrates  this  capability,  then  we  will  enter  into  Phase  Two  of  the  Com-
mercial  Crew  and  Cargo  program  and  procure  these  services  from  the  commercial
sector via the competitive procurement process.

Meanwhile,  much  work  on  Orion  already  has  been  accomplished.  In  May,  six
vertical drop tests of a body mass simulator, in support of landing systems develop-
ment,  took  place  at  Langley  Research  Center,  and  all  Phase  One  arc  jet  testing  for
thermal projection systems was completed at Ames Research Center. In June, Ames
and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory completed the first phase of a real-time operating
trade  study  evaluation  and  delivered  an  interim  report,  and  Orion  thermal  protec-
tion system material was arc jet tested at Johnson Space Center. In July, the Orion
cockpit team conducted crew evaluations of proposed window designs and the flight
test  article  System  Requirements  Review  (SRR)  was  completed.  This  month  we
kicked off the Orion SRR and made the Phase Two contract award for the Thermal
Protection  System  Advanced  Development  Project.  In  October,  NASA  will  hold  a
Preliminary Design Review for the Orion flight test article. We are moving forward.
On the Ares front, we now have models being tested in wind tunnels. We are firing
engine  components  and  will  be  conducting  a  launch  abort  test  in  2008  and  a  full-
scale Ares I–1 test launch in April 2009. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)/
Lunar  Crater  Observation  and  Sensing  Satellite  (LCROSS)  mission  is  on  track  for
launch in 2008.
Conclusion

The Space Shuttle is the world’s most versatile spacecraft to date. The Constella-
tion program’s Orion and Ares will be even more so. They are designed to fly to the
Moon, but they also may be used to service the International Space Station. We are
looking  at  ways  that  Constellation  will  support  expeditions  to  other  bodies  in  the
solar  system  after  we  are  finished  exploring  Mars.  The  possibilities  seem  limitless.
Most importantly, the Constellation Program and our Commercial Orbital Transpor-
tation Services (COTS) efforts will assure America’s access to space after the Space
Shuttle is retired in 2010.

Orion  is  the  focus  of  America’s  21st  century  crewed  space  transport  strategy,  de-
signed  to  continue  the  evolution  of  exploration  experience  and  cutting-edge  tech-
nology  that  began  with  the  Apollo  Program.  Orion  will  help  further  our  under-
standing  of  Earth,  the  solar  system,  the  universe,  and  the  origins  of  life  itself.  It
will  support  our  exploration  missions  by  providing  crew  ascent  and  entry  into
Earth’s  atmosphere,  orbital  and  deep-space  transit,  transfer  capabilities,  and  oper-
ations at the Moon, Mars, and elsewhere.

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  before  you  today.  I  look
forward to working closely with the Congress to ensure American leadership on the
frontier  of  the  future.  I  would  be  pleased  to  respond  to  any  questions  you  or  the
other Members of the Committee may have.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  ALLEN  LI,  DIRECTOR,  ACQUISITION  AND
SOURCING  MANAGEMENT,  GOVERNMENT  ACCOUNTABILITY
OFFICE
Mr.  LI.  Before  I  begin,  allow  me  to  congratulate  NASA,  its  em-
ployees,  and  contractors  on  its  latest  two  achievements:  Atlantis’
successful  mission,  marking  the  long-awaited  return  to  space  sta-
tion assembly, and Opportunity’s breathtaking look at Victoria Cra-
ter.  They  are  reminders  of  the  excitement  and  challenges  associ-
ated  with  space  exploration,  and  the  importance  dedication  and
teamwork play in achieving mission success.

Chairman  Boehlert,  Ranking  Member  Gordon,  and  Members  of
the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our
work  on  NASA’s  efforts  to  implement  its  space  exploration  plans
and  the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  specifically.  As  requested,  I  will
highlight my statement.

At  the  request  of  this  committee,  GAO  initiated  several  reviews
over the past year that have implications for implementation of the
President’s Vision for Space Exploration. In our December 2005 re-
port  regarding  NASA’s  acquisition  policies,  we  made  several  rec-
ommendations to help ensure NASA uses a knowledge-based acqui-
sition  approach  to  make  informed  investment  decisions.  More  re-
cently,  in  July  of  2006,  we  issued  a  report  that  questioned  the  af-
fordability  of  NASA’s  exploration  program,  and  in  particular,
NASA’s  acquisition  approach  for  the  CEV,  now  known  as  Orion.
Based on those reports, I will raise four issues.

Issue number one. NASA cannot develop a firm cost estimate for
the exploration program at this time because the program is in its
early stages. The current estimate is $230 billion over the next two
decades.  Changes  that  have  occurred  to  the  program  over  the  past
year  illustrate  its  evolving  nature.  True,  changes  are  appropriate
and  understandable  at  this  early  stage,  but  changes  do  not  allow
the Agency to firmly identify program requirements and needed re-
sources,  a  key  element  of  knowledge-based  acquisition  approach.
Thus,  we  concluded  that  NASA  was  not  in  a  position  to  make  a
long-term commitment to the program.

Issue  number  two.  NASA  will  likely  be  challenged  to  implement
the  program  as  laid  out  in  its  exploration  systems  architecture
study  because  of  the  high  costs  associated  with  the  program  in
some years. Despite initial surpluses, the sustainability of the pro-

55

gram  is  questionable,  given  its  long-term  funding  outlook.  NASA’s
preliminary  projections  show  multi-billion  dollar  shortfalls  for  its
Exploration  Directorate  in  all  fiscal  years  from  2014  to  2020,  with
an overall deficit through 2025 exceeding $18 billion. Furthermore,
funds  NASA  is  planning  to  have  after  2010  made  possible  by  the
retirement  of  the  Shuttle  may  not  be  available  to  the  extent  pro-
jected.  This  is  because  Shuttle  transition  needs  are  still  being
quantified.

Issue  number  three.  NASA’s  acquisition  strategy  for  the  CEV
was  not  based  on  obtaining  an  adequate  level  of  knowledge  to
make  an  informed  investment  decision.  NASA  planned  to  commit
the  government  to  a  long-term  product  development  effort  without
a  sound  business  case.  This  entails  having  well-defined  require-
ments, mature technology, a preliminary design, and firm cost esti-
mates  that  realistic  budget  projections  can  handle.  Without  such
knowledge,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  with  any  confidence  how  much
the  program  will  cost,  what  technologies  will  or  will  not  be  avail-
able  to  meet  performance  expectations,  and  when  the  vehicle  will
be ready for use.

As  you  know,  we  recommended  in  our  July  2006  report  that
NASA alter its strategy to reduce these risks by securing additional
knowledge. NASA disagreed. However, as Dr. Horowitz’s statement
indicates,  NASA  subsequently  adjusted  its  acquisition  approach
and  now  production  and  sustainment  portions  of  the  contract  are
options,  a  move  that  is  consistent  with  our  recommendation,  since
it  lessens  the  government’s  financial  obligation  at  this  early  stage.
However,  risks  persist  with  NASA’s  approach.  NASA  still  has  no
assurance that the project will have a sound business case in place
at preliminary design review. Therefore, commitment to efforts be-
yond  that  point,  even  when  limited  to  design  and  development  ac-
tivities, is a risky approach.

My  final  issue.  NASA’s  current  acquisition  policies  and  project
guidance  do  not  include  major  decision  reviews  beyond  the  initial
project  approval  gate,  nor  a  standard  set  of  criteria  with  which  to
measure  projects  at  crucial  phases.  As  we  pointed  out  in  our  De-
cember 2000 report—2005 report, these decision reviews and devel-
opment  measures  are  key  markers  needed  to  ensure  that  project
progress  and  decisions  are  based  on  the  appropriate  levels  of
knowledge. These markers can help lessen project risks.

In  response  to  our  recommendations,  NASA  stated  that  it  would
make  several  changes  to  bring  its  policies  more  in  line  with  a
knowledge-based  approach.  For  example,  NASA  plans  to  add  re-
quirements  for  success  at  key  junctures  and  require  additional
project  decision  reviews.  While  these  changes  are  not  yet  imple-
mented,  recent  briefings  and  discussion  with  NASA  officials  indi-
cate  that  the  Agency  plans  to  do  so  in  revised  project  program
management policies.

NASA  would  be  well-served  by  fully  implementing  our  rec-
ommendations,  thereby  placing  itself  in  a  better  position  to  lessen
risks,  obtain  good  program  outcomes,  and  achieve  mission  success.
So where do we go from here? Orion is only one piece of the pie.
Implementing the Vision over the coming decades will require hun-
dreds  of  billions  of  dollars  and  a  sustained  commitment  from  mul-
tiple Administrations and Congresses. With a range of federal com-

56

mitments  binging  the  fiscal  future  of  the  United  States,  competi-
tion  for  resources  within  the  Federal  Government  will  be  fierce.
Consequently, as it proceeds with its acquisition strategy for Orion
and  other  key  projects,  it  will  be  important  for  NASA  to  ensure
that  its  investment  decisions  are  sound  and  based  on  high  levels
of knowledge. This will allow decision-makers to make informed de-
cisions about where continued investments are justified.

From  the  perspective  of  the  Congress,  tools  have  recently  been
instilled  for  more  effective  oversight.  Indeed,  cost  growth  in  excess
of  stated  thresholds  as  well  as  information  on  technology  and
schedule risks must now be reported as required by the NASA Au-
thorization Act of 2005. GAO stands ready to assist this committee
in its oversight responsibilities.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  oral  statement.  I  will  be
pleased  to  answer  any  questions  you  or  other  Members  may  have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Li follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ALLEN LI

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

I am pleased to be here today to discuss the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration’s  (NASA)  plans  for  implementing  the  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Ex-
ploration (Vision).1 NASA plans to spend nearly $230 billion over the next two dec-
ades—more  than  $31  billion  of  which  will  be  spent  in  the  next  five  years—to  bring
the  Vision  to  reality.2 In  July  2006,  we  issued  a  report  that  questioned  the  pro-
gram’s  affordability,  and  in  particular,  NASA’s  acquisition  approach  for  one  of  the
program’s  major  projects—the  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV).3 My  statement
today, which is based upon that report and another report evaluating NASA’s acqui-
sition  policies,4 highlights  our  continuing  concerns  with  the  affordability  of  the  ex-
ploration  program  and  the  acquisition  approach  for  the  CEV  project,  as  well  as  the
absence  of  firm  requirements  in  NASA’s  acquisition  policies  for  projects  to  proceed
with development with the appropriate level of knowledge. Given the competing de-
mands  facing  the  Federal  Government  and  an  already  troubling  funding  profile  for
the  program,  it  is  imperative  that  NASA  implement  the  various  aspects  of  the  Vi-
sion  in  a  fiscally  prudent  and  competent  manner.  Our  work  was  performed  in  ac-
cordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Summary

In  summary,  we  found  that  because  NASA’s  exploration  program  is  in  its  early
stages, the Agency cannot develop a firm cost estimate for the program at this time.
The changes that have occurred to the program over the past year and the resulting
refinement  of  its  associated  cost  estimates  are  indicative  of  the  evolving  nature  of
the  program.  Furthermore,  we  found  that  it  will  likely  be  a  challenge  for  NASA  to
implement  the  program,  as  laid  out  in  its  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  study
(ESAS)5 due  to  the  high  costs  associated  with  the  program  in  some  years  and  the
long-term  sustainability  of  the  program  relative  to  anticipated  funding.  Finally,  we
found  that  NASA’s  acquisition  strategy  for  the  CEV  was  not  based  upon  obtaining
an  adequate  level  of  knowledge  when  making  key  resources  decisions,  placing  the

1 The  Vision  includes  a  return  to  the  Moon  that  is  intended  ultimately  to  enable  exploration
of Mars and other destinations. To accomplish this, NASA initially plans to (1) complete its work
on the International Space Station by 2010, fulfilling its commitment to 15 international partner
countries;  (2)  begin  developing  a  new  manned  exploration  vehicle  to  replace  the  Space  Shuttle;
and  (3)  return  to  the  Moon  no  later  than  2020  in  preparation  for  future,  more  ambitious  mis-
sions.

2 All cost estimates related to the Vision are reported as inflated (‘‘real year’’) dollars.

sion.  The  architecture  supports  the  development  of  a  new  CEV,  Crew  Launch  Vehicle  (CLV),
a  Cargo  Launch  Vehicle  (CaLV),  and  other  supporting  systems.  The  architecture  also  calls  for
various  Research  and  Technology  (R&T)  and  Robotic  Lunar  Exploration  Program  (RLEP)
projects. NASA’s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate’s Constellation program is responsible
for the development of the CEV, CLV, and CaLV.

program  at  risk  for  cost  overruns,  schedule  delays,  and  performance  shortfalls.
These risks were evident in NASA’s plan to commit to a long-term product develop-
ment  effort  before  establishing  a  sound  business  case  for  the  project  that  includes
well-defined  requirements,  mature  technology,  a  preliminary  design,  and  firm  cost
estimates. Furthermore, in our 2005 report on NASA’s acquisition policies, we found
that  NASA’s  policies  lacked  major  decision  reviews  beyond  the  initial  project  ap-
proval gate and lacked a standard set of criteria with which to measure projects at
crucial  phases  in  the  development  life  cycle.  These  decision  reviews  and  develop-
ment measures are key markers needed to ensure that projects are proceeding with
and decisions are being based upon the appropriate level of knowledge and can help
to lessen project risks.

In our July 2006 report, we recommended that NASA adjust its acquisition strat-
egy  to  ensure  that  sufficient  program  knowledge—to  include  well-defined  require-
ments,  mature  technologies,  a  stable  design,  and  realistic  cost  estimates—be  at-
tained  prior  to  committing  the  government  to  a  long-term  contract.  NASA  did  not
concur with our recommendation and in late August awarded a contract for the de-
sign,  development,  production,  and  sustainment  of  the  CEV  to  Lockheed  Martin.
However,  prior  to  awarding  the  contract,  NASA  adjusted  its  acquisition  approach
and  the  Agency  included  the  production  and  sustainment  portions  of  the  contract
as  options—a  move  that  is  consistent  with  the  recommendation  in  our  report  be-
cause  it  lessens  the  government’s  financial  obligation  at  this  early  stage.  While
these changes are positive steps, the Agency’s acquisition strategy needs further re-
finement  to  conform  to  acquisition  best  practices.  Given  the  approach  that  NASA
has  chosen,  continued  congressional  oversight  will  be  critical  for  ensuring  that  the
program  stays  within  cost  and  schedule  goals.  This  is  especially  true  given  NASA’s
‘‘go  as  you  can  afford  to  pay’’  approach,  wherein  lower  priority  efforts  will  be  de-
ferred, descoped, or discontinued to allow NASA stay within its budget profile. Com-
peting  demands  within  the  Agency,  coupled  with  a  declining  supply  of  federal  dis-
cretionary  funding  requires  due  diligence  on  the  part  the  Agency  and  Congress  to
ensure successful program outcomes. As our work has found, all too often, programs
are  allowed  to  proceed  without  adequate  knowledge  being  attained  at  key  phases
of  development.  Without  such  knowledge,  it  is  difficult  to  predict  with  any  con-
fidence how much the program will cost, what technologies will or will not be avail-
able  to  meet  performance  expectations,  and  when  the  vehicle  will  be  ready  for  use.
Background

Despite  many  successes  in  the  exploration  of  space,  such  as  landing  the  Path-
finder and Exploration Rovers on Mars, NASA has had difficulty bringing a number
of projects to completion, including several efforts to build a second generation reus-
able  human  space  flight  vehicle  to  replace  the  Space  Shuttle.  NASA  has  attempted
several  costly  endeavors,  such  as  the  National  Aero-Space  Plane,  the  X–33  and  X–
34, and the Space Launch Initiative. While these endeavors have helped to advance
scientific  and  technical  knowledge,  none  have  completed  their  objective  of  fielding
a  new  reusable  space  vehicle.  We  estimate  that  these  unsuccessful  development  ef-
forts  have  cost  approximately  $4.8  billion  since  the  1980s.  The  high  cost  of  these
unsuccessful  efforts  and  the  potential  costs  of  implementing  the  Vision  make  it  im-
portant  that  NASA  achieve  success  in  its  new  exploration  program  beginning  with
the CEV project.

Our past work has shown that developing a sound business case, based on match-
ing  requirements  to  available  and  reasonably  expected  resources  before  committing
to  a  new  product  development  effort,  reduces  risk  and  increases  the  likelihood  of
success.  High  levels  of  knowledge  should  be  demonstrated  before  managers  make
significant  program  commitments,  specifically:  (1)  At  program  start,  the  customer’s
needs  should  match  the  developer’s  available  resources  in  terms  of  availability  of
mature  technologies,  time,  human  capital,  and  funding;  (2)  Midway  through  devel-
opment,  the  product’s  design  should  be  stable  and  demonstrate  that  it  is  capable
of meeting performance requirements; (3) By the time of the production decision, the
product  must  be  shown  to  be  producible  within  cost,  schedule,  and  quality  targets,
and have demonstrated its reliability. Our work has shown that programs that have
not  attained  the  level  of  knowledge  needed  to  support  a  sound  business  case  have
been  plagued  by  cost  overruns,  schedule  delays,  decreased  capability,  and  overall
poor  performance.  With  regard  to  NASA,  we  have  reported  that  in  some  cases  the
Agency’s  failure  to  define  requirements  adequately  and  develop  realistic  cost  esti-

mates-two key elements of a business case-resulted in projects costing more, taking
longer, and achieving less than originally planned.6
Firm Cost Estimates Cannot Be Developed at This Time

Although NASA is continuing to refine its exploration architecture cost estimates,
the Agency cannot at this time provide a firm estimate of what it will take to imple-
ment  the  architecture.  The  absence  of  firm  cost  estimates  is  mainly  due  to  the  fact
that the program is in the early stages of its life cycle. NASA conducted a cost risk
analysis  of  its  preliminary  estimates  through  fiscal  year  2011.  On  the  basis  of  this
analysis and through the addition of programmatic reserves (20 percent on all devel-
opment  and  10  percent  on  all  production  costs),  NASA  is  65  percent  confident  that
the actual cost of the program will either meet or be less than its estimate of $31.2
billion  through  fiscal  year  2011.  For  cost  estimates  beyond  2011,  when  most  of  the
cost  risk  for  implementing  the  architecture  will  be  realized,  NASA  has  not  applied
a  confidence  level  distinction.  Since  NASA  released  its  preliminary  estimates,  the
Agency  has  continued  to  make  architecture  changes  and  refine  its  estimates  in  an
effort  to  establish  a  program  that  will  be  sustainable  within  projected  resources.
While changes to the program are appropriate at this stage when concepts are still
being  developed,  they  leave  the  Agency  in  the  position  of  being  unable  to  firmly
identify  program  requirements  and  needed  resources.  NASA  plans  to  commit  to  a
firm  cost  estimate  for  the  Constellation  program  at  the  preliminary  design  review
in 2008, when requirements, design, and schedule will all be base-lined. It is at this
point where we advocate program commitments should be made on the basis of the
knowledge secured.

Expected  Budget  and  Competing  Demands  Will  Challenge  Architecture  Imple-

mentation

NASA will be challenged to implement the ESAS recommended architecture with-
in its projected budget, particularly in the longer-term. As we reported in July 2006,
there are years when NASA has projected insufficient funding to implement the ar-
chitecture with some yearly shortfalls exceeding $1 billion; while in other years the
funding  available  exceeds  needed  resources.  Per  NASA’s  approach,  it  plans  to  use
almost  $1  billion  in  appropriated  funds  from  fiscal  years  2006  and  2007  in  order
to  address  the  short-term  funding  shortfalls.  NASA,  using  a  ‘‘go  as  you  can  afford
to pay’’ approach, maintains that in the short-term the architecture could be imple-
mented within the projected available budgets through fiscal year 2011 when fund-
ing  is  considered  cumulatively.  However,  despite  initial  surpluses,  the  long-term
sustainability  of  the  program  is  questionable  given  the  long-term  funding  outlook
for the program. NASA’s preliminary projections show multi-billion-dollar shortfalls
for its Exploration Systems Mission Directorate in all fiscal years from 2014 to 2020,
with an overall deficit through 2025 in excess of $18 billion. According to NASA offi-
cials,  the  Agency  will  have  to  keep  the  program  compelling  for  both  Congress  and
potential international partners, in terms of the activities that will be conducted as
part of the lunar program, in order for the program to be sustainable over the long
run.

NASA  is  attempting  to  address  funding  shortfalls  within  the  Constellation  pro-
gram by redirecting funds to that program from other Exploration Systems Mission
Directorate  activities  to  provide  a  significant  surplus  in  fiscal  years  2006  and  2007
to  cover  projected  shortfalls  beginning  in  fiscal  year  2009.  Several  Research  and
Technology  programs  and  missions  were  discontinued,  descoped,  or  deferred  and
that funding was shifted to the Constellation Program to accelerate development of
the CEV and CLV. In addition, the Constellation program has requested more funds
than required for its projects in several early years to cover shortfalls in later years.
NASA officials stated the identified budget phasing problem could worsen given the
changes  that  were  made  to  the  exploration  architecture  following  issuance  of  the
study. For example, while life cycle costs may be lower in the long run, acceleration
of development for the five segment Reusable Solid Rocket Booster and J–2X engine
will  likely  add  to  the  near-term  development  costs,  where  the  funding  is  already
constrained.  NASA  has  yet  to  provide  cost  estimates  associated  with  program
changes.

NASA  must  also  contend  with  competing  budgetary  demands  within  the  Agency
as  implementation  of  the  exploration  program  continues.  NASA’s  estimates  beyond
2010 are based upon a surplus of well over $1 billion in fiscal year 2011 due to the
retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2010. However, NASA officials said the costs
for  retiring  the  Space  Shuttle  and  transitioning  to  the  new  program  are  not  fully
understood;  thus,  the  expected  surplus  could  be  less  than  anticipated.  This  year,

NASA  plans  to  spend  over  39  percent  of  its  annual  budget  for  Space  Shuttle  and
International  Space  Station  (ISS)  operations—dollars  that  will  continue  to  be  obli-
gated each year as NASA completes construction of the ISS by the end of fiscal year
2010. This does not include the resources necessary to develop ISS crew rotation or
logistics  servicing  support  capabilities  for  the  ISS  during  the  period  between  when
the  Space  Shuttle  program  retires  and  the  CEV  makes  its  first  mission  to  the  ISS.
While,  generally,  the  budget  for  the  Space  Shuttle  is  scheduled  to  decrease  as  the
program moves closer to retirement, a question mark remains concerning the dollars
required to retire the Space Shuttle fleet as well as transition portions of the infra-
structure  and  workforce  to  support  implementation  of  the  exploration  architecture.
In  addition,  there  is  support  within  Congress  and  the  scientific  community  to  re-
store  money  to  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  that  was  transferred  to  the  Space
Shuttle program to ensure its viability through its planned retirement in 2010. Such
a change could have an impact on future exploration funding.
Lack of Sound Business Case Puts CEV Acquisition at Risk

In  July  2006,  we  reported  that  NASA’s  acquisition  strategy  for  the  CEV  placed
the  project  at  risk  of  significant  cost  overruns,  schedule  delays,  and  performance
shortfalls because it committed the government to a long-term contract before estab-
lishing a sound business case. We found that the CEV contract, as structured, com-
mitted the government to pay for design, development, production and sustainment
upon  contract  award—with  a  period  of  performance  through  at  least  2014  with  the
possibility of extending through 2019.

Our  report  highlighted  that  NASA  had  yet  to  develop  key  elements  of  a  sound
business  case,  including  well-defined  requirements,  mature  technology,  a  prelimi-
nary  design,  and  firm  cost  estimates  that  would  support  such  a  long-term  commit-
ment. Without such knowledge, NASA cannot predict with any confidence how much
the  program  will  cost,  what  technologies  will  or  will  not  be  available  to  meet  per-
formance  expectations,  and  when  the  vehicle  will  be  ready  for  use.  NASA  has  ac-
knowledged that it will not have these elements in place until the project’s prelimi-
nary design review scheduled for fiscal year 2008. As a result, we recommended that
the NASA Administrator modify the current CEV acquisition strategy to ensure that
the  Agency  does  not  commit  itself,  and  in  turn  the  Federal  Government,  to  a  long-
term  contractual  obligation  prior  to  establishing  a  sound  business  case  at  the
project’s  preliminary  design  review.  In  response  to  our  recommendation,  NASA  dis-
agreed  and  stated  that  it  had  the  appropriate  level  of  knowledge  to  proceed  with
its  current  acquisition  strategy.  NASA  also  indicated  that  knowledge  from  the  con-
tractor is required in order to develop a validated set of requirements and, therefore,
it was important to get the contractor on to the project as soon as possible. In addi-
tion, according to NASA officials, selection of a contractor for the CEV would enable
the  Agency  to  work  with  the  contractor  to  attain  knowledge  about  the  project’s  re-
quired  resources  and,  therefore,  be  better  able  to  produce  firm  estimates  of  project
cost.  In  our  report,  we  highlighted  that  this  is  the  type  of  information  that  should
be  obtained  prior  to  committing  to  a  long-term  contract.  To  our  knowledge,  NASA
did  not  explore  the  possibility  of  utilizing  the  contractor,  through  a  shorter-term
contract,  to  conduct  work  needed  to  develop  valid  requirements  and  establish  high-
er-fidelity cost estimates—a far less risky and costly strategy.

Subsequent  to  our  report,  NASA  did,  however,  take  steps  to  address  some  of  the
concerns we raised. Specifically, NASA modified its acquisition strategy for the CEV
and  made  the  production  and  sustainment  schedules  of  the  contract—known  as
Schedules  B  and  C—contract  options  that  the  Agency  will  decide  whether  to  exer-
cise after project’s critical design review in 2009. Therefore, NASA will only be liable
for the minimum quantities under Schedules B and C when and if it chooses to ex-
ercise  those  options.  These  changes  to  the  acquisition  strategy  lessen  the  govern-
ment’s  financial  obligation  at  this  early  stage.  Table  1  outlines  the  information  re-
lated to the CEV acquisition strategy found in the request for proposal and changes
that  were  made  to  that  strategy  prior  to  contract  award.  While  we  view  these
changes as in line with our recommendation and as a positive step to address some
of  the  risks  we  raised  in  our  report,  NASA  still  has  no  assurance  that  the  project
will  have  the  elements  of  a  sound  business  case  in  place  at  the  preliminary  design
review.  Therefore,  NASA’s  commitment  to  efforts  beyond  the  project’s  preliminary
design  review—even  when  this  commitment  is  limited  to  design,  development,  test
and  evaluation  activities  (DDT&E)—is  a  risky  approach.  It  is  at  this  point  that
NASA  should  (a)  have  the  increased  knowledge  necessary  to  develop  a  sound  busi-
ness  case  that  includes  high-fidelity,  engineering-based  estimates  of  life  cycle  cost
for the CEV project, (b) be in a better position to commit the government to a long-
term effort, and (c) have more certainty in advising Congress on required resources.

Sound Management and Oversight Key to Addressing CEV Project Risks

Sound project management and oversight will be key to addressing risks that re-
main for the CEV project as it proceeds with its acquisition approach. To help miti-
gate these risks, NASA should have in place the markers necessary to help decision-
makers monitor the CEV project and ensure that is following a knowledge based ap-
proach to its development. However, in our 2005 report that assessed NASA’s acqui-
sition  policies,  we  found  that  NASA’s  policies  lacked  major  decision  reviews  beyond
the  initial  project  approval  gate  and  a  standard  set  of  criteria  with  which  to  meas-
ure  projects  at  crucial  phases  in  the  development  life  cycle—key  markers  for  moni-
toring  such  progress.  In  our  review  of  the  individual  center  policies,  we  found  that
the  Johnson  Space  Center  project  management  policy,  which  is  the  policy  that  the
CEV  project  will  be  required  to  follow,  also  lacked  such  key  criteria.  We  concluded
that  without  such  requirements  in  place,  decision-makers  have  little  knowledge
about  the  progress  of  the  Agency’s  projects  and,  therefore,  cannot  be  assured  that
they  are  making  informed  decisions  about  whether  continued  investment  in  a  pro-
gram or project is warranted.

We  recommended  that  NASA  incorporate  requirements  in  its  new  systems  engi-
neering  policy  to  capture  specific  product  knowledge  at  key  junctures  in  project  de-
velopment. The demonstration of such knowledge could then be used as exit criteria
for decision-making at the following key junctures:

• Before projects are approved to transition in to implementation, we suggested
that  projects  be  required  to  demonstrate  that  key  technologies  have  reached
a high maturity level.

• Before projects are approved to transition from final design to fabrication, as-
sembly, and test, we suggested that projects be required to demonstrate that
the design is stable.

• Before  projects  are  approved  to  transition  to  production,  we  suggested  that
projects  be  required  to  demonstrate  that  the  design  can  be  manufactured
within cost, schedule, and quality targets.

In  addition,  we  recommended  that  NASA  institute  additional  major  decision  re-
views  that  are  tied  to  these  key  junctures  to  allow  decision-makers  to  reassess  the
project based upon demonstrated knowledge.

61

While NASA concurred with our recommendations, the Agency has yet to take sig-
nificant actions to implement them. With regard to our first recommendation, NASA
stated  that  the  Agency  would  establish  requirements  for  success  at  the  key  junc-
tures mentioned above. NASA planned to include these requirements in the systems
engineering  policy  it  issued  in  March  2006.  Unfortunately,  NASA  did  not  include
these criteria as requirements in the new policy, but included them in an appendix
to the policy as recommended best practices criteria. In response to our second rec-
ommendation,  NASA  stated  it  would  revise  its  program  and  project  management
policy  for  flight  systems  and  ground  support  projects,  due  to  be  completed  in  fall
2006. In the revised policy, NASA indicated that it would require the results of the
critical design review and, for projects that enter a large-scale production phase, the
results of the production readiness review to be reported to the appropriate decision
authority  in  a  timely  manner  so  that  a  decision  about  whether  to  proceed  with  the
project can be made. NASA has yet to issue its revised policy; therefore, it remains
to  be  seen  as  to  whether  the  CEV  project  decision  authorities  will  have  the  oppor-
tunity  to  reassess  and  make  decisions  about  the  project  using  the  markers  rec-
ommended  above  after  the  project  has  initially  been  approved.  Briefings  that  we
have recently received indicate that NASA plans to implement our recommendation
in the revised policy.

The  risks  that  NASA  has  accepted  by  moving  ahead  with  awarding  the  contract
for  DDT&E  for  CEV  could  be  mitigated  by  implementing  our  recommendations  as
it  earlier  agreed.  Doing  so  would  provide  both  NASA  and  Congress  with  markers
of  the  project’s  progress  at  key  points.  For  example,  at  the  preliminary  design  re-
view, decision-makers would be able to assess the status of the project by using the
marker of technology maturity. In addition, at the critical design review, the Agency
could  assess  the  status  of  the  project  using  design  stability  (i.e.,  a  high  percentage
of  engineering  drawings  completed).  If  NASA  has  not  demonstrated  technology  ma-
turity  at  the  preliminary  design  review  or  design  stability  at  the  critical  design  re-
view, decision-makers would have an indication that the project will likely be head-
ed for trouble. Without such knowledge, NASA cannot be confident that its decisions
about continued investments in projects are based upon the appropriate knowledge.
Furthermore, NASA’s oversight committees could also use the information when de-
bating  the  Agency’s  yearly  budget  and  authorizing  funds  not  only  for  the  CEV
project,  but  also  for  making  choices  among  NASA’s  many  competing  programs.  If
provided  this  type  of  information  from  NASA  about  its  key  projects,  Congress  will
be in a better position to make informed decisions about how to invest the Nation’s
limited discretionary funds.

NASA’s  ability  to  address  a  number  of  long-standing  financial  management  chal-
lenges  could  also  impact  management  of  NASA’s  key  projects.  The  lack  of  reliable,
day-to-day  information  continues  to  threaten  NASA’s  ability  to  manage  its  pro-
grams,  oversee  its  contractors,  and  effectively  allocate  its  budget  across  numerous
projects and programs. To its credit, NASA has recognized the need to enhance the
capabilities  and  improve  the  functioning  of  its  core  financial  management  system,
however,  progress  has  been  slow.  NASA  contract  management  has  been  on  GAO’s
high-risk list since 1990 because of such concerns.
Conclusions

In conclusion, implementing the Vision over the coming decades will require hun-
dreds  of  billions  of  dollars  and  a  sustained  commitment  from  multiple  administra-
tions and Congresses. The realistic identification of the resources needed to achieve
the  Agency’s  short-term  goals  would  provide  support  for  such  a  sustained  commit-
ment  over  the  long-term.  With  a  range  of  federal  commitments  binding  the  fiscal
future  of  the  United  States,  competition  for  resources  within  the  Federal  Govern-
ment will only increase over the next several decades. Consequently, it is incumbent
upon  NASA  to  ensure  that  it  is  wisely  investing  its  existing  resources.  As  NASA
proceeds  with  its  acquisition  strategy  for  the  CEV  project  and  other  key  projects,
it will be essential that the Agency ensure that the investment decisions it is mak-
ing  are  sound  and  based  upon  high  levels  of  knowledge.  NASA  should  require  that
the  progress  of  its  projects  are  evaluated  and  reevaluated  using  knowledge  based
criteria,  thereby  improving  the  quality  of  decisions  that  will  be  made  about  which
program  warrant  further  investment.  Furthermore,  it  will  be  critical  that  NASA’s
financial  management  organization  delivers  the  kind  of  analysis  and  forward-look-
ing  information  needed  to  effectively  manage  its  programs  and  projects.  Clear,
strong  executive  leadership  will  be  needed  to  ensure  that  these  actions  are  carried
out.  Given  the  Nation’s  fiscal  challenges  and  those  that  exist  within  NASA,  the
availability of significant additional resources is unlikely. NASA has the opportunity
to  establish  a  firm  foundation  for  its  entire  exploration  program  by  ensuring  that
the  level  of  knowledge  necessary  to  allow  decision-makers  to  make  informed  deci-

sions  about  where  continued  investment  is  justified.  Doing  so  will  enhance  con-
fidence  in  the  Agency’s  ability  to  finally  deliver  a  replacement  vehicle  for  future
human space flight.

Mr.  Chairman,  this  concludes  my  prepared  statement.  I  would  be  pleased  to  re-

spond to any questions that you or other Members of the Committee may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR ALLEN LI

As Director of the Acquisition and Sourcing Management Team, Mr. Li is respon-
sible for leading GAO’s work at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA)  and  for  reviewing  defense  acquisition  programs.  He  also  serves  as  the
Team’s  Director  for  Operations,  managing  day-to-day  activities  of  a  geographically
dispersed  group.  Examples  of  recent  work  include  NASA’s  efforts  to  develop  and
build  the  International  Space  Station  (ISS),  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  (CEV),  the
James Webb Telescope, and Shuttle alternatives for supplying the ISS; the Agency’s
management  of  its  Deep  Space  Network  (DSN);  and  NASA’s  implementation  of  its
Integrated  Enterprise  Management  Program.  Defense  work  recently  completed  in-
clude  identification  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  development  of  the  Navy’s  EA–
18G electronic attack aircraft.

Prior  to  assuming  his  current  duties,  Mr.  Li  was  an  Associate  Director  in  GAO’s
Energy, Resources, and Science Issue Area where he directed work on research and
development,  nuclear  safety,  and  Department  of  Energy  management  issues.  Over
the past twenty-seven years at GAO, he has worked in several other units, including
GAO’s  Transportation  Issue  Area  where  he  specialized  in  aviation  safety  and  air
traffic  control  modernization.  Mr.  Li  has  frequently  testified  before  Senate  and
House Committee and Subcommittees on civil and military issues. He also testified
before  the  Columbia  Accident  Investigation  Board  following  the  tragic  loss  of  the
Shuttle Columbia and its crew.

Mr.  Li  has  received  several  awards  at  GAO:  the  Comptroller  General’s  Distin-
guished Service Award, two Comptroller General’s Meritorious Service Awards, and
Director and Outstanding Achievement Awards from several GAO units. He was se-
lected  for  GAO’s  Senior  Executive  Service  in  February  1993  and  designated  Asso-
ciate Director of Transportation Issues. Mr. Li has a B.S. degree in Aerospace Engi-
neering  from  the  University  of  Maryland.  Mr.  Li  is  married  to  the  former  Ellen
Dziuszko and lives in Oak Hill, VA. They have two adult children, Christopher and
Allison.

DISCUSSION

CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Li.
Let me start by asking you some of the questions I addressed in
my  opening  statement,  and  when  you  respond,  I  would  like  Dr.
Horowitz to respond to your response.

The  questions  were  what  specifically  should  Congress  be  doing
and  what  documentation  should  we  be  seeking  to  keep  a  watchful
eye on Orion development?

Secondly,  and  now  that  the  contract  has  been  awarded,  what

other steps should NASA be taking to avoid cost escalation?

Mr.  LI.  Your  first  question  has  to  do  with  exactly  the  point  that
I  just  ended  with,  which  is  the  tools  are  there.  The  NASA  Author-
ization  Act  will  require  NASA  to  report  to  this  committee  on  the
progress  and  all  the  technical  risks  associated  with  its  program.
Those  are  some  things  that  this  committee  did  not  have  before.  I
believe  that  your  use  of  those  particular  tools  will  be  very  impor-
tant, and I think that for them to provide you with honest answers
in terms of where the status is, is going to be extremely important.
The second question is one that I think we all have to be worried
about. There are a lot of things that NASA can be doing. They have
identified that they have reduced the risks. Obviously, in this par-
ticular case, I have indicated that I don’t agree with them. I think

that  they  have  gone  further  than  they  should.  Be  that  as  it  may,
the  contract  is  signed.  Let  us  move  on.  I  believe  that  at  this  point
in  time,  what  NASA  needs  to  do  is  to  abide  and  conform  with  the
policies  and  management  guidance  that  is  going  to  be  finalized,
hopefully  in  the  coming  weeks,  and  that  will  provide  for  more
knowledge-based decisions in the future.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much,  and  Dr.  Horowitz,
just  before  you  respond  to  that,  let  me  point  out—and  I  think
Chairman Calvert and Mr. Rohrabacher before him, and Mr. Udall
will  agree—that  essentially  we  have  got  the  Nunn-McCurdy  lan-
guage  in  the  authorizing  legislation,  and  that  is  a  tribute  to  the
Subcommittee  and  to  the  foresight  of  one  of  our  most  valuable
members  who  is  no  longer  a  member  of  the  professional  staff,  Mr.
Adkins, Bill Adkins.

Mr. Horowitz.
Dr. HOROWITZ. Thank you, sir.
The  first  question,  what  should  we  do,  and  we  do  have  manda-
tory  reports  which  we  will  provide  to  you  on  a  timely  basis.  I  be-
lieve  we  have  been  very  good  recently  at  providing  all  reports  to
this committee as requested, and we will continue to do so.

But  I  think  we  are  going  to  go  above  and  beyond  that,  and  the
way  we  are  going  to  do  that  is  with  open  communications.  We  are
going  to  come  and  visit  you  and  let  you  know.  You  won’t  have  to
wait for a report to let you know what is going on. I have charged
my  staff  to  make  sure  that  when  things  are  happening,  we  keep
you informed. It is our job to keep those lines of communication so
you know what is going on. You have every right to know how your
program is going, and we are very proud to share it with you.

What  should  we  do  to  avoid  the  cost  of  overruns?  A  day  doesn’t
go  by  that  I  don’t  say  this  to  my  staff.  This  is  all  about  perform-
ance,  cost,  and  scheduling.  Every  day  you  need  to  ask  yourself,
whether  you  are  working  on  a  contract,  whether  you  are  working
on a design idea, whether you are working on an integration issue,
you  always  have  to  think  about  performance,  cost,  and  schedule.
Having that in the forefront of your mind will allow us to do things
like implement some of the recommendations that GAO gave us on
making our contracts more responsible and to give the government
better value for its dollar.

So  that  is  basically  the  mantra  and  those  are  the  ways  that  we

are going to avoid the cost overruns.

GAO’S RESPONSE TO NASA CHANGES

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Let  me  commend  you  for  the  open  dia-
logue—continuing openness and continuing dialogue with the Com-
mittee and the Members and the staff. That is essential.

Mr.  Li,  if  you  had  to  give  a  mark,  how  would  you  grade  NASA’s

response to the GAO report?

Mr.  LI.  Well,  I  have  to  be  honest  with  you.  When  I  first  got  the
written response to the draft report, I was disappointed since they
non-concurred. But I do believe that the events that have occurred
subsequent to that—and I believe that both Houses, both this par-
ticular  Committee  and  the  Senate,  forced  a  better  understanding
and  caused  NASA  and  my  team  to  get  together,  and  we  discussed
our  differences.  And  I  believe  that  that  was—as  a  result  of  that,

as  you  indicated  in  your  opening  statement,  I  think  that  is  what
oversight  is.  That  is  what  good  government  is.  We  were  able  to
have  them  have  a  better  understanding  of  what  our  concern  was,
and as a result, they modified the contract to have options. I think
that was a step in the right direction.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you,  sir,  very  much.  This  Com-

mittee believes very strongly in oversight.

So often in the Congress we do good deeds with the best of inten-
tions  and  pat  ourselves  on  the  back  and  say  ‘‘Boy,  wasn’t  that
great?’’  Let  us  go  on  to  the  next  thing,  and  don’t  pause  to  go  back
and  see  if  what  we  did  originally  was  the  right  thing  and  people
are  responding  in  the  appropriate  manner.  So  you  have  given  us
some  good  direction,  and  I  want  to  thank  you  on  behalf  of  the  en-
tire Committee.

With that, Mr. Gordon.

BUDGET CONCERNS
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  am  afraid  that  there  is  not  going  to  be  much  done  about  our
spiraling budget deficits over the next two years, but I think in the
election  of  2008,  both  on  the  Presidential  and  Congressional,  it  is
going to be a major issue. And with that, there is going to be need-
ed budget pressure. I am concerned about NASA being able to sur-
vive  and  get  the  increases  that  we  are  talking  about.  And  so  we
may  have  to  deal  with  not  only  not  getting  those  increases,  but  it
could get worse.

Now, let me—I want to—that is the context. I want to congratu-
late  NASA  in  terms  of  the  approach  you  took  with  the  CEV  in
terms of not overreaching in terms of technology and trying to, you
know,  trying  to  do  the  job  with  reachable  technology.  I  think  that
was  a  smart  approach  and  I  think  it  follows  Mr.  Griffin’s  overall
approach to things. I compliment you for that.

Now,  in  your  non-concurrence  letters,  you  were  very  confident
about  being  able  to  complete  on  time  and  on  budget,  and  in  your
testimony  you  have  here  today.  And  so  since  you  have  such  con-
fidence,  would  NASA  be  willing  to  accept  a  formal  cost  cap  on  the
CEV program?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  I  believe,  sir,  to  answer  your  question,  we
actually  are  operating  under  a  cost  cap.  The—I  have  been  given  a
budget.  I  have  to  make  this  program  fit  inside  that  budget  or  we
cannot  do  any  of  the  other  things  that  we  want  to  do.  If  I  allow
the  CEV  development  to  run  over  cost  and  schedule,  we  are  not
going to be able to do the goals of going on to the Moon and beyond
because what you see here——

Mr. GORDON. So then what are you going to do, then, if—that is

your job, so you are going to keep it within cost, you say.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Right.
Mr.  GORDON.  So  will  you  take  money  from  the  rest  of  the  explo-

ration program or from other agency activities?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Everything has to——
Mr. GORDON. What will you do?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Everything  has  to  come  out  of  my  exploration
budget due to the exploration. We are going to make our programs
fit  inside  of  exploration.  You  only  have  the  three  things  I  talked

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

about  before.  You  have  performance,  costs,  and  schedule,  and  you
need  a  certain  minimum  performance,  for  example,  getting  the
CEV  to  orbit  and  accomplishing  that  mission.  You  need  more  per-
formance to get to the Moon——

Mr.  GORDON.  So  if  you  take  it  out  of  exploration,  then  what  if

you just wind up with a CEV and nothing else?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Well, the other thing you have left is schedule. If
you  can’t  get  the  job  done  with  minimum  performance  and  you
have only a certain number of resources——

Mr.  GORDON.  But  if  you  are  going  to  have  to  get  into  resources
and  you  are  doing  away  with—so  are  you  just  saying  you  will  just
keep stretching the bounds?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  You  have  no  choice.  With  a  set  number  of  re-
sources  to  achieve  a  minimum  performance,  if  you  are  falling  be-
hind, the only out you have to stay within your resources——

Mr. GORDON. So then if you are—again, you are saying very com-
petently  you  are  going  to  do  this,  so  why  would  it  not  be  appro-
priate to have a formal cost cap?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  I  can  take  that  for  the  record.  I  don’t  know  any
reason  why  you  wouldn’t,  but  I  can  go  back  and  discuss  that  with
my staff.

[The information follows:]
Historically,  cost  caps  have  not  proven  effective  in  managing  major  NASA  re-
search and development (R&D) programs. Constraining the International Space Sta-
tion  (ISS)  to  $2.1  billion  annually  did  little  to  control  overall  program  costs.  And
while life cycle cost caps are regularly imposed on small, discrete projects (e.g., Ex-
plorer,  Discovery)  as  part  of  the  selection  process,  they  are  not  easily  adapted  to
major  R&D  efforts  that  extend  far  beyond  the  current  budget  horizon.  In  the  case
of  large  development  programs  such  as  Constellation,  cost  caps  can  be  problematic
as  they  depend  on  assumptions  regarding  outyear  funding.  The  future  priorities  of
the  country  are  not  known  and  can  change  over  the  life  of  the  Constellation  pro-
gram.

At  its  early  formulation  stage,  the  Constellation  Program  is  certain  to  face  ‘‘un-
known  unknowns’’  as  we  continue  to  refine  requirements,  develop  advanced  tech-
nologies,  and  begin  to  integrate  the  various  systems  into  an  operational  infrastruc-
ture  to  enable  long-term  exploration  of  the  Moon  and  Mars.  When  Constellation
moves  into  the  implementation  phase,  after  Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR)  in
the spring of 2008, design, cost, and schedule baselines will be established, and Pro-
gram  performance  will  be  measured  against  metrics  established  at  the  various  key
decision points throughout the life of the program. At this juncture, NASA will sub-
mit Constellation project life cycle cost commitments to Congress. Under Section 103
of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155), NASA is required to submit
Major  Program  Annual  Reports,  the  first  of  which  shall  include  a  Baseline  Report
that is to include an estimate of the life cycle cost for those programs. Under Section
103, NASA is required to report changes to the Baseline Report—including life cycle
cost  estimates—as  part  of  the  annual  budget  request.  NASA  will  notify  the  Com-
mittee  at  other  junctures,  as  necessary,  if  there  are  any  adjustments  to  life  cycle
cost estimates. As such, NASA would advise against imposition of a formal statutory
‘‘cost cap’’ on CEV development.

Mr. GORDON. Okay. It looks like somebody may have already dis-
cussed  it  for  you  there.  Do  they  have  anything  you  want  to  add  to
it?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  the  only  other  part  is—which  comes  to  my
initial  statement  is  one  of  the  things  that  I  will  guarantee  will
drive  the  costs  higher  over  time  is  if  we  have  unstable  funding  for
the  program,  and  I  can’t  provide  stability  to  the  project.  Also——
Mr. GORDON. You can guarantee it will get more expensive if you

have to stretch it out a long time, too.

66

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Right,  and  the  thing  that  usually  happens  is  if
you short fund a program in the near-term, you can guarantee that
you  will  stretch  it  out  and  you  will  increase  its  costs  in  the  long-
term.

Mr. GORDON. Which again goes back to the original problem.
Mr.  Li,  GAO’s  July  17  report  to  us  made  the  following  rec-
ommendation.  In  light  of  the  fact  that—and  I  am  quoting  you—or
the  report,  which  is  probably  you.  ‘‘In  light  of  the  fact  that  NASA
plans  to  award  the  contract  for  CEV  in  September  of  2006,  Con-
gress  should  consider  restricting  annual  appropriations  and  lim-
iting  NASA’s  obligations  for  CEV  project  to  only  the  amount  of
funding  necessary  to  support  activities  needed  to  successfully  com-
plete  the  project’s  preliminary  design  review.’’  Do  you  still  stand
behind that recommendation, and if not, why not?

Mr. LI. I do. I mean, the application of a knowledge-based acqui-
sition  strategy  is  one  which  within  the  body  of  work  that  we  have
conducted  at  GAO  has  proven  and  has  shown  that  when  you  don’t
abide  by  those  particular  principles,  which  is  not  going  beyond
what  your  knowledge  tells  you,  that  you  do  run  into  trouble.  I
mean,  the  Committee  has  a  great  list  of  DOD  programs  and  this
particular  committee  is  aware  of  one  of  them,  being  the  NPOESS,
that have great exceeded their costs and projected costs because of
such things as faulty assumptions, and I will have to say, there are
some  programs  that  we  have  reviewed  that  have  faulty  assump-
tions associated with the use of heritage technology. That has hap-
pened.  So  I  am  cautious  when  I  hear  NASA  indicate  that  this  is
low-risk technology.

My  recollection  is  that  people  that  were  telling  me  about  the
space  station  not  being  very  high  technology.  They  are  just  mod-
ules  up  in  space,  and  yet,  I  seem  to  recall  a  $5  billion  increase
somewhere along the line.

Mr. GORDON. Mr. Li, I want to give Dr. Horowitz a chance to re-
spond.  I  guess  what  we  are  seeing  here  is  this  cloud  of  skepticism
because  of  NPOESS  and  other  things.  We  only  want—we  think—
at least, I think that we have the best vets available at NASA now
and  they  are  doing  the  best  job  available,  but  there  is  this  skep-
ticism and the concern that you can’t put 1,000 pounds of canaries
in a 500-pound box.

And  so  what  would  be  your  response  to  Mr.  Li’s—or  to  that  rec-

ommendation?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  sir,  the  thing  that  I  wanted  to  bring  out  in
this  program  is  we  talk  about  the  knowledge  and  technology.  This
is much different than, for example, NPOESS, in that we know ex-
actly what we want here.

One  of  the  things—and  to  give  the  space  station  as  an  example,
is  the  requirements  kept  changing,  and  guaranteed,  if  you  keep
changing  your  requirements:  how  big  is  it  going  to  be,  how  many
people are going to be on it, all that——

Mr.  GORDON.  What  about  the  recommendation  that  Congress
should  consider  restricting  annual  appropriations  and  limiting
NASA’s  obligations  for  CEV  project  to  only  the  amount  of  funding
necessary  to  support  activities  needed  to  successfully  complete  the
project’s preliminary design review?

67

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  this  comes  back  to  the  point  of  the  stable
funding.  We  have  a  budget  profile  laid  out  to  successfully  execute
this project, and if we short fund the project in the near-term when
we  are  working  our  way  to  the  preliminary  design  review,  now
with our contractor on board, we will guarantee to delay the execu-
tion of this project and not meet the milestones, and therefore actu-
ally the program will get more expensive, not less expensive.

Mr. GORDON. Well, Mr.——
Mr.  LI.  I  disagree  because  there  should  not  be  a  connection  be-
tween  funding  and  the  different  phases  of  an  acquisition.  You  can
still ensure that you have that funding in the future without break-
ing it at PDR, for example.

Mr. GORDON. I need to stop, but I guess the premise that we are
concerned  about  here  is  this.  I  don’t  think  it  is  a  foregone  conclu-
sion  that  we  are  going  to  do  this  no  matter  what,  and  to  some  ex-
tent, you are saying okay, it can always be stretched out but it will
cost more. Well that means ultimately there has to be some money
coming in.

I don’t know—you know, there is a point at which we might very
well  say  this  is  too  expensive,  this  is  not  working,  let  us  stop,  you
know,  cut  our  losses.  And  you  seem  to  be  working  under  the
premise  we  are  going  to  do  it  no  matter  what,  and  I  am  not  sure
that  is  what  Congress  is  going  to  do.  And  so  that  is  what  we  are
trying to do is reach a point where if we can do it in a responsible
way.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Calvert.
Mr.  CALVERT.  Well,  I  guess  I  got  a  little  more  positive  attitude,
but  I  would  like  to  point  out,  too,  by  the  way,  the  deficit  isn’t  spi-
raling out of control. It has actually come down $109 billion, based
on  the  CBO  estimate,  but  that 
just
thought——

is  another  subject.  I 

Mr. GORDON. Are you satisfied?

TRANSITION CHALLENGES

Mr.  CALVERT.  We  are  making  progress.  We  are  happy  to  say—

like I said, I just have a different attitude.

But  I  want  to  point  out  that  there  are  some  things  that  we  do
in  this  country  that  are  extremely  important,  and  I  think  this  is
one of them. One point that I want to make is that if we don’t have
this  operational  within  the  time  constraints  that  you  have  set  out,
2014—and  this  is,  I  guess,  a  question  for  Dr.  Horowitz—what  is
going to happen to that labor force in Houston and in Florida?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Sir, this is one of the biggest concerns and some-
thing  we  work  on  every  day  is  the  transition.  One  of  the  reasons
the  designs  look  the  way  they  do  before  you  is  one  of  the  key  ele-
ments of design was how do we make the most value of all the in-
vestment  we  have,  not  just  in  our  hardware  and  our  technology,
but  in  our  workforce,  because  the  workforce  is  the  key.  It  is  the
people. People say what does it take to make a rocket fly, and they
say you talk to engines and propulsion. It is not that; it is the thou-
sands of people that we have working——

Mr. CALVERT. Okay——
Dr. HOROWITZ. If we lose that support——

68

Mr.  CALVERT.  I  remember,  you  know—we  are  about  the  same
age, maybe you are a little bit younger, but the Apollo Gemini pro-
gram,  when  we  had  that  gap  between  the  Apollo  Gemini  and  the
Shuttle program, what happened to the labor force then?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  that  was  a  disastrous  time  for  NASA.  We

lived through that——

Mr. CALVERT. Okay. So we can’t allow——
Dr. HOROWITZ. We lost all that capability——

INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION

Mr. CALVERT. We cannot allow that to happen, and not only that,
if  we  are  not  in  outer  space  between  that  so-called  gap  period  be-
tween  2010  and  whenever  we  successfully  launch  these  vehicles,
does that mean nobody will be in outer space?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Absolutely not, sir. We have had demonstrated to
us  that  there  are  a  lot  of  other  countries  very  interested  in  going
to space.

Mr.  CALVERT.  There  is  competition  out  there  today,  isn’t  there?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Yes,  sir.  Anybody  who  understands  what  this  is
all about is out there going to space. There are many other people.
Mr.  CALVERT.  You  know,  I  was  looking  at  the—you  know,  I  was
commenting  with  my  seatmate  here  about  the  Ares  V  and  the  lift
capability  of  that,  and  of  course,  we  go  back  and  think  of  the  old
Saturn,  but  that  has  a  lift  capability  of  what,  approximately  100
tons?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  This  one  can  lift  a  little  more  than  a  Saturn  V,

about 125 metric tons.

Mr.  CALVERT.  One  hundred  twenty-five  metric  tons.  What  is  the

heaviest lift capability we have now?

Dr. HOROWITZ. It is less than the small rocket you see to its left,

which is on the order of 20 to 25 metric tons.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Now,  is  there  potentially  other  revenue  streams
that could be utilized for Ares V in other parts of the government?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Yes,  sir,  I  am  sure  there  are  other  people  that

might be interested.

Mr. CALVERT. You mean, there is no country in the world at this

point that can launch 125 metric tons?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  there  is  nobody  else  who  has  this  capability.

MORE TRANSITION CHALLENGES

Mr.  CALVERT.  Okay.  Now,  you  put  together  a  pretty  good  con-
tractor  team,  and  the  people  who  put  this  together,  like  you  are
saying,  we  are  kind  of  going  back  to  the  future,  as  I  have  heard
the  slogan  before.  That  the  technology  that  you  are  using  is—you
are  not  going  to  use  risky  technology  that  has  not  proven  itself.  Is
that a correct statement?

Dr. HOROWITZ. That is correct.
Mr. CALVERT. So you feel pretty comfortable that the budget you
have set forth and the time constraints that you are under, you can
meet?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir, absolutely.

69

Mr. CALVERT. How confident would you say are you at controlling
overall  cost  development  of  the  Orion  Crew  Vehicle  and  also  the
Ares V?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  we  are  very  confident.  We  have  all  the  tech-
nologies  above  what  we  call  TRL  [Technology  Readiness  Level]  6,
so we don’t see any issues there.

Mr. CALVERT. Okay.
Mr. Li, I do believe—I am a former business guy, you know, and
I—when  I  was  in  the  restaurant  business  we  worked  on  a  three
percent margin. So I woke up every morning and tried to figure out
what  I  was  going  to  sell  and  what  the  profit  margin  was  going  to
be, and just try to come out alive at the end of the day.

So obviously, we are dealing with larger numbers here, but when
we  are  going  through  this  process—and  I  think  we  are—I  think
Congress  is  committed  to  see  this  through.  I  think  the  country  is
committed  to  see  this  through.  You  know,  from  my  perspective,  I
want  to  be  on  the  Moon  to  greet  the  Chinese,  not  the  other  way
around.  That  is  just  maybe  a  nationalistic  statement  on  my  part,
but that is just the way I am.

But  what  should  we  do  as  a  Committee  as  we  move  forward  on
this—what  points  would  you  think  are  most  important  to  make
sure that we have oversight to make sure that we keep this moving
in  the  right  direction  and  we  maintain  reasonable  cost  control  as
we move forward? And recognizing when you are dealing with new
technology—I am on the Armed Services Committee, you know, the
F–22 we didn’t do too good.

Mr. LI. No.
Mr.  CALVERT.  And  so—as  a  matter  of  fact,  any—as  you—and  I
know  you  work  on  DOD.  We  do  a  lousy  job  in  the  Department  of
Defense.  I  am  hoping  that  NASA  does  a  much  better  job  than  we
do in the DOD on new weapons system procurement. As you know,
on the new Joint Strike Fighter, I think that thing is out of control
again,  and  my  friends  over  here,  I  mean,  we  are  going  to  have  to
get  that  brought  in  or  we  are  not  going  to  be  developing  that  pro-
gram.

So  what  can  we  do  to  stay  on  this  to  make  sure  that  we  keep

control on this process?

Mr. LI. Thank you for your question. I think the issue here—and
we touched on some of the points. You were raising the issue of the
industrial  base,  I  think  is  the  way  that  I  would  characterize  that
in  terms  of  with  the  Shuttle  winding  down,  what  happens  to  all
those  people.  I  am  also  worried,  not  only  on  those—of  the  people
that  they  are  using,  but  also  their  suppliers  and  also  the  various
tiers of suppliers that go by. So I think that transition is extremely
important.

I  think  the  big  challenge,  sir,  is  going  to  be  integration.  I  think
the issue here is not just talking about the CEV, talking about the
CLV,  talking  about  the  CaLV,  it  is  the  whole  ball  of  wax.  And  I
am encouraged because in talking with Dr. Horowitz, I understand
that  he  is  trying  to  build  people  within  his  team  that  will  do  that
integration, but I think that is going to be a big challenge.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  ex-

pired.

INTEGRATION CHALLENGES

Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  Li,  Dr.  Horowitz,  as  I  mentioned  in  my  opening  statement,
I  also  serve  on  the  Armed  Services  Committee,  as  does  my  good
friend  from  California,  Mr.  Calvert.  And  from  that  vantage  point,
I  have  seen  some  of  the  problems  that  have  arisen  when  we  have
tried to acquire space systems. And I wonder whether the DoD ex-
periences  for  some  reason  for  caution  as  we  assess  NASA’s  plans.
I  wanted  to  read  a  couple  of  quotes  this  document,  the  Acquisi-
tion  of  National  Security  Space  Programs  Influential  2003  Joint
Task Force. First, ‘‘Unrealistic estimates lead to unrealistic budgets
and  unexecutable  programs.  The  space  acquisition  process  is
strongly  biased  to  produce  unrealistically  low  cost  estimates
throughout  the  process.’’  And  to  another  quote,  ‘‘The  government
acquisition  environment  has  encouraged  excessive  optimism  and  a
can-do  spirit.  Program  managers  have  accepted  programs  with  in-
adequate resources and excessive levels of risk.’’

The Task Force then goes on to recommend that when estimating
cost  of  space  acquisition  programs,  ‘‘National  security  space  pro-
grams should be budgeted at the 80/20 level, which the Task Force
believes  to  be  the  most  probable  cost.’’  As  you  know,  NASA  cur-
rently  is  using  a  lower  competence  level  to  estimate  the  cost  of  its
CEV  program,  and  the  difference  between  NASA’s  cost  estimate
and  the  estimate  we  get  when  we  follow  the  Task  Force  rec-
ommendation  is  $5.5  billion,  not  insignificant,  which  is  also  a  sig-
nificant increase in the estimated cost.

Mr.  Li,  GAO  has  done  a  lot  of  oversight  on  national  security
space  programs,  and  you  have  looked  at  NASA’s  Exploration  pro-
gram  now.  Are  there  any  parallels  that  from  your  point  of  view
that we need to be concerned about as we evaluate——

Mr.  LI.  Thank  you  for  your  question,  and  I  have  had  the  oppor-
tunity  to  work  on  many  of  those  programs.  Mr.  Calvert,  actually
for  several  years  I  monitored  the  F–22  program,  well  aware  of  the
problems associated with Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).

But  on  the  space  acquisition,  the  space  program  specifically  has
been a real thorn in DOD’s side. To DOD’s credit, they are making
some changes right now, recognizing that the things that they have
done  in  the  past,  which  is  buying  something  all  at  once  doesn’t
work.  They  are  going  to  be  a  lot  more  careful  in  making  sure  that
those  things  that  they  have  to  discover  are  going  to  be  in  science
and  technology.  Once  they  have  those  technologies  mature,  they
will bring that forward to—in the systems development process.

The things that NASA can learn from that is that there are some
issues,  as  I  indicated  initially.  They  made  some  assumptions  on
programs  like  NPOESS  and  programs  such  as  SBIRS  High,  pro-
grams  that  have  identified  the  fact  that  technology,  low-risk  tech-
nology, that they were bringing from heritage type programs, actu-
ally did not pan out, and that is why I am cautioned—and I would
like  to  think  that  some  of  these  things  that  NASA  are  doing  is
going  to  be  low-risk,  but  I  think  that  from  the  standpoint  of  inte-
gration,  when  you  are  bringing—I  recall  when  I  had  my  old  1976
Dodge,  I  had  the  components  for  a  car.  The  ones  that  I  have  right
now  on  my  2000  Durango  are  quite  different.  They  are  the  same

components,  but  when  they  put  them  together,  when  I  open  that
hood,  I  can’t  even  figure  out  what  hose  is  going  to  where.  That  is
the  issue.  The  components  are  probably  basically  the  same,  but
once you integrate them, it is a completely different story.

Mr. UDALL. I think Chairman owns a ’76 Dodge as well. But Dr.

Horowitz, would you care to comment?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Oh, sorry. I have a ’70 TR–6 I put a Corvette en-
gine  in,  so  that  was  quite  an  integration  challenge.  You  can  come
to my shop any time.

No, absolutely. We have the same concerns. We worry about inte-
gration.  This  is  a  large  integration  task.  We  worry  about  doing  it
a  piece  at  a  time.  These  are  the  first  two  pieces.  Our  two  pieces
just  happen  to  be  a  lot  bigger.  If  you  look  at  all  of  the  things  it
is going to take for exploration, we are taking off bite-sized chunks
at a time. They are just big bites because of the size of our vehicles
that we fly.

Technology,  again,  I  shall  come  back  to.  We  are  using  as  much
known technology, and we do have technology lines. We have iden-
tified  the  top  40  technologies  and  when  they  are  urged  to  support
future  programs.  In  fact,  one  of  the  things  we  can  use  your  help
and  support  in  is  making  sure  we  can  protect  our  technology  in-
vestments  because  we  do  realize  that  if  we  don’t  invest  in  those
early  that  later  they  will  come  to  bite  us,  so  we  are  prioritizing
every  single  one  of  our  technologies,  tying  to  every  place  we  need
it to make sure that we get the development on time and on sched-
ule,  and  we  are  using  and  the  new  guidance,  which  was  from  the
recommendations from the GAO on the decision points and the key
decision  points  are  all  being  identified,  and  we  are  putting  proper
oversight and insight at each of those points.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  expired.  Mr.

Rohrabacher?

MORE BUDGET CONCERNS

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  let  me  admit  that  I  don’t  know  a  darn
thing  about  engines  of  cars,  and  I  don’t  even  know  how  to  change
the  oil  in  my  car,  plus  put  parts  in  from  other  cars,  et  cetera,  but
one  thing  I  do  know  about  is  getting  the  bill  at  the  end  of  the
month and trying to figure out how I am going to pay it. And what
I  am  looking  at  here  is  I  am  trying  to  figure  out  what  the  bill  is
going to be at the end and how we are going to pay it.

Let me see if I can get this straight. Dr. Horowitz, to develop the
Orion,  the  Ares  I  is  the  first  of  the  two  rocket  parts  of  the  Orion
project.  So  how  much  will  it  cost  us  to  get  one  of  those  rockets  so
that they are ready to go and do into space?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Okay, sir, the——
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  The  rocket?  Now,  you  say  you  are  going  to

use a lot of things that are coming from other rockets, so——

Dr. HOROWITZ. Okay, sir. Thank you for that question.
It is interesting in the development. We are developing a launch
system,  so  what  you  will  see  is,  you  will  see  increase  cost  in  the
development  of  the  Ares  I  and  the  reason  that  we  are  increasing
the development is we have made some changes to make the parts
more  common  between  the  Ares  I  and  Ares  V.  We  added  the  J–2.

We  had  originally  based  it  on  a  Space  Shuttle  Main  Engine,  and
so  in  order  to  drive  down  the  lifecycle  cost  of  the  program,  it  was
worth investing and developing that engine earlier, which will then
not be needed to be redeveloped.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, how much is the price tag at when you

put the thing up? The first one?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  the  whole  development,  I  will  have  to  take
that for the record as the exact cost of the entire integrated devel-
opment.  The  recurring  cost  that  came  of  the  estimates,  including
flying the capsule, was in the order of $200 million a flight.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay, but how much is it going to cost us to

get to the point to get to the recurring time period?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  I  have  the  breakdown  by  the  whole  Con-
stellation  Systems.  I  can  get  you  the  breakdown  by  components  if
you like. I can take that for the record.

[The information follows:]
Launch vehicle costs for the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle through the first human
launch,  currently  projected  late  in  FY  2014,  are  approximately  $10.8  billion.  This
number  excludes  the  Orion  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  mission  and  ground  oper-
ations  and  facility  modifications,  and  program  integration  and  other  program-level
costs.  Orion  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  project  costs  through  first  human  flight  are
about $10.3 billion. Therefore, combined Ares I and Orion project costs through first
human  launch  are  about  $21.1  billion.  If  related  required  programmatic  and  non-
flight  hardware  costs  are  included  in  the  estimate,  it  will  cost  about  $33.5  billion
to get to the point of first human launch projected in 2014.

All  of  these  numbers  include  reserves,  but  exclude  Corporate  G&A.  These  num-
bers  include  estimates  for  FYs  2012,  2013,  and  2014,  which  lie  beyond  the  budget
horizon.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay,  so  in  other  words,  we  are  moving  for-

ward with both of these now——

Dr. HOROWITZ. Right.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.—and  that  is  part  of  the  same  budget

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes.
Mr. ROHRABACHER.—so it is hard for you to break out what that

first one is going to be?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Yes,  sir.  And  I  can  go  get  you  actual  breakdown.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay, but you are telling me that it is going

to be $200 million a flight, starting what year?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  The  first  human  flights  are  scheduled—the  oper-

ational flights will be in test in 2012.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  We  will  have  the  first  fight  test  in  2009,  but  the

full-up operation are scheduled for 2014.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Yes,  and  that  is  $200  million  a  flight  from

figure——

that point on?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Right,  and  that  is  a  functional  flight  rate,  also.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. And you are guessing how much? Is it 30? Do

I see the figure $31 billion here somewhere?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  The  overall  program  is  about  $30  billion  for  the
horizon  forecast  out  into  the  2011  timeframe  if  you  add  up  all  of
the  cost  for  the  entire  Constellation  program,  which  includes  the
launch vehicles, the Orion spacecraft, the ground systems, the tech-
nology  program,  the  human-research  program,  and  the  robotics
precursor  programs,  which  will  fly  a  mission  to  the  Moon  in  2008,
and impactor, and a lander.

73

Mr. ROHRABACHER. And that is how much, all together, then?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  All  of  that,  integrated,  to  the  2011  timeframe  is

approximately $30 billion, total.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thirty billion, and then somewhere along the
line,  when  we  are  actually  going  to  get  back  to  the  Moon,  it  is
going to cost us about $110 billion or something?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  I  don’t  know.  I  will  take  that  for  the  record
what the total is, but I just have the run out for the current budget
out in front of me.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay, so we are going to spend over $30 bil-

lion before we see that rocket go up. Is that right?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  No,  sir.  You  will  see  the  first  test  flight  of  the

Mr. ROHRABACHER. One——
Dr. HOROWITZ.—in 2009, which is several years before——
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Dr.  HOROWITZ.—five  years  before  years  get  to  the  end  of  that

Ares I——

timeline.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. No, when I say go up, I mean actually be——
Dr. HOROWITZ. On an operational mission.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Operational basis.
Dr. HOROWITZ. With people?
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Right.
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Ready  to  go?  Full-up?  That  would  be  about  the

total cost of the program to that point.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Thirty-one billion dollars up until that point?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  That  is  the  number  I  have  for  the  total  run-out

of the current budget.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Li, do you think that is a realistic figure?
Mr.  LI.  Well,  since  I  don’t  believe  that  the  requirements  have
been fully established, I don’t think that there is any confidence in
what that number is, and we won’t have a better idea of what that
is until 2008.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  Until,  2008,  all  right.  So  let  me  ask
you this: where is the money coming from in NASA for that money?
Are we reducing spending elsewhere to make that money or is that
coming  out  of  a  new  type  of  potion  that  we  have  that  creates
wealth out of nothing?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Sir, thanks for that question.
The  money  needed  to  do  this  program  is  all  of  the  money  that
has  been  allocated  to  the  exploration  line.  And  everything  that  we
have laid out fits inside of the budget that we have been given. So
we  have  put  together  a  program  that  fits  inside  of  the  resources
that have been allocated to us.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. You know, I would hope that some day some-
one  who  testifies  somewhere  before  I  leave  would  come  and  say,
you  know,  we  have  just  decided  that  a  couple  of  these  other
projects  have  less  value  than  the  one  we  are  talking  about  today,
and  we  are  going  to  get  rid  of  two  centers,  two  NASA  centers.  We
have  ten  NASA  centers.  We  are  going  to  get  rid  of  two  of  them  in
order  to  have  a  project  to  the  Moon;  and  I  have  not  heard  that.  I
have been here 18 years, and I have never heard anybody talk that
way.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Mr.  Rohrabacher,  you  know  my  affection
for  you,  so  I  am  going  to  make  you  feel  better.  They  are  getting
rid of the Shuttle. That is a good example.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, that is a——
Chairman BOEHLERT. So do you feel a little bit better?
Mr. ROHRABACHER. I do feel better.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  All  right.  That  is  good.  And  the  gentle-

man’s time has expired.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Well, thank you very much.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Green?
Mr. GREEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member. As
we go back to the future, my fear is that we may come back to the
past. We are talking about, as I understand it, $122 billion through
2018,  and  let  me  just  start  by  asking  if  that  is  a  correct  number
for  Constellation  costs.  Is  that  correct,  $122  billion  through  2018?

Mr. LI. Yes.
Mr. GREEN. Given that as correct, and understanding that some-
times  we  have  persons  who  see  very  large  coffers  and  they  spend
rather  lavishly,  what  do  we  have  contained  within  this  to  ensure
us  that  we  won’t  buy  $500  hammers  that  we  can  go  out  to  the
hardware  store  and  purchase  for,  shall  we  say,  considerably  less,
or  that  we  won’t  buy  toilets  seats  for  hundreds  of  dollars  that  we
can  purchase  for  considerably  less.  And  I  say  this  only  because  it
has happened. This is not something that would be unique if it oc-
curred  as  we  go  back  to  the  future.  So  would  one  of  you  fine  men
care to elaborate, please?

Mr.  LI.  Well,  you  know,  I  don’t  think  that  based  upon  the  fact
that,  as  I  indicated,  the  requirement  have  been  sufficiently  identi-
fied. I cannot with confidence tell you that there won’t be any cost
grown. I think that a lot of the technologies that they have identi-
fied  are  things  that  do  make  sense.  I  have  to  hand  them  that
much,  but  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  there  are  a  lot  of  things  that
we  don’t  know  yet,  and  some  of  those  things  will  happen  during
testing,  during  integration.  And  at  that  point  in  time,  as  we  know
more,  then,  we  will  be  able  to  make  some  better  projections.  But
I think NASA is the one that needs to answer you question.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir. And thank you for that.
The idea of runaway costs on individual items, the way you con-
trol costs in a program is you design analysis cycles, we are in our
second  iteration  of  design  analysis  cycles.  We  have  already  de-
signed  this  vehicle  four  times,  so  we  are  actually  gaining  knowl-
edge and getting a higher confidence in our estimates.

When  you  start  the  program  and  you  just  say  I  want  to  go  the
Moon, you have some initial concepts, and you make some estimate
using  the  estimating  tools.  As  you  get  further  into  the  design,  you
get better a better cost estimates until eventually, when you finally
build it, of course, you know you are at 100 percent. So we are im-
proving  our  cost  estimating  every  single  design  cycle,  and  in  fact,
we  are  in  a  cycle  right  now  which  will  provide  us  an  even  higher
confidence  in  our  estimate.  We  actually  have  a  signed  contract  for
a vehicle——

Mr.  GREEN.  If  you  would,  Doctor,  allow  me  to  interrupt  for  just
a  moment.  Give  your  guesstimate  as  to  how  sure  you  are  of  this.
Let us assume you could be 100 percent or you could be something

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

75

less  than  100  percent.  How  sure  are  you  that  we  could  avoid  the
concerns that I have called to your attention?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  sir,  I  am  extremely  certain  that  we  can
avoid  these  because  we  are  going  to  implement  a  lot  of  the
tools——

Mr. GREEN. Is that 100 percent?
Dr. HOROWITZ. I am 100 percent certain that we can avoid these
problems  with  proper  program  management  and  proper  oversight.

MORE TRANSITION CHALLENGES

Mr.  GREEN.  Okay.  Now,  another  question,  quickly,  and  this  one
has  to  do  with  the  integration  of  people  as  opposed  to  equipment.
If  we  integrate  as  we  assume  we  will,  what  percentage  of  person
will be lost from the project, will actually lose their jobs?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  thank  you  for  that  question.  It  really  comes
to  one  of  the  hearts  of  why  this  transition  is  so  important  to  all
of  us.  Basically,  the  NASA  budget  is  fairly  flat.  We  know  what  it
is;  we  know  what  percent  we  spend  on  the  workforce  inside  of
NASA  and  how  much  we  spend  on  our  contractor  workforce.  That
number  is  not  going  to  change;  therefore,  the  number  of  jobs  and
the  number  of  people  aren’t  going  to  change.  What  we  need  to  do
is transition the workforce to do different things. We need the same
number of people doing different things. Will there be some people
displaced in the transition? Absolutely. Our goal is to keep as much
and all of the talent we need to accomplish——

Mr. GREEN. Reclaiming my time for just a moment. Will most of
those people be at the upper level, lower level or mid-level that we
will lose?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Sir, I don’t have an estimate at which level which
people will be lost. There will be a transition at every level at every
program.

Mr.  GREEN.  My  assumption  is  that  you  will  need  the  engineers,

so we won’t lose a lot of engineers. Is that a fair statement?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Well, we are going to need engineers, technicians,
operators, production people, managers, program managers, project
leaders at all levels.

Mr.  GREEN.  But  at  this  level,  you  have  no  ideas  where  you  will

telligence?

suffer your losses in terms of personnel.

Dr. HOROWITZ. I don’t have any hard numbers to tell you exactly
which  positions  at  which  level  that  are  going  to  be  lost.  We  are
working on the transition plans at this time.

Mr.  GREEN.  And  when  do  you  anticipate  having  that  type  of  in-

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  the  estimates  will  get  better  all  the  time.
I can take that for the record and get back to you with our current,
rough  estimate,  and  then  as  they  improve,  we  can  provide  you  as
the transition plan progresses, more accurate estimates.

Mr. GREEN. I would be honored if you would.
Dr. HOROWITZ. It would be my pleasure, sir.

Civil servants currently supporting the Shuttle Program are generally either part

Since  the  Constellation  Program  relies  upon  certain  Shuttle-derived  technologies,
we  expect  to  find  some  commonality  in  hardware  and  operations  requirements  as
we transition from Shuttle to Orion. At the same time, we are aggressively pursuing
systems  and  processes  that  will  allow  us  to  operate  more  efficiently  and  effectively
as  we  develop  the  Nation’s  new  space  capabilities.  This  effort  includes  commercial
and international partnerships that could lower operations costs and better position
us to achieve the Vision for Space Exploration’s goals.

During  FY  2006,  the  Exploration  Directorate  embarked  on  a  joint  workforce  re-
view  with  Space  Operations  and  NASA’s  Program  Analysis  and  Evaluation  group
to  study  these  very  issues.  The  team  completed  the  first  of  its  planned  center  as-
sessments  at  JSC  in  July,  and  will  be  visiting  MSFC  in  November.  The  results  of
this study will feed into the FY 2009 Budget process, which will focus on the Shut-
tle-Orion transition.

are recognized.

CEV SAFETY

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  you,  and  I  thank  the  chairman  for  having
this,  another  good  meeting.  And  I  am  thankful,  also,  for  Dr.  Horo-
witz, his history, his present, and what he going to be doing for us
in the future. Both of our witnesses have alluded in their testimony
the  next  few  years  are  critical  for  NASA  and  the  vision  for  space
exploration.

The  Committee  in  particular  is  going  to  need  to  really  exercise
its oversight power to make sure that the vision stays on track and
that  we  meet  our  stated  milestones,  and  you  have  indicated  100
percent  sure  if  you  do  that,  and  there  is  always  an  allowance  for
when  they  don’t  do  it  exactly  right;  then  that  percentage  would  be
affected,  plus  or  minus,  but  getting  a  CEV  going  now  is  very  crit-
ical to us if we are going to shorten the gap between the retirement
of  the  Space  Shuttle—we  know  we  are  going  to  do  that—and  the
Orion mission.

I  just  have  a  couple  of  questions  relating  to  the  design  of  the
CEV  and  the  overall  contract.  As  the  Committee  knows,  I  am  not
the  only  strong  proponent  of  astronaut  safety.  We  are  all  up  here,
every  one  us  have  that  deep  down  in  our  crawl,  and  that  has  af-
fected  us  back  through  the  years  of  setting  budgets  and  knowing
that we have had to set them with safety in mind and knowing the
effect  that  had  on  the  budget  and  the  increased  increment  of  the
budge for that, but we couldn’t take a chance on that. I got funding
in this for a study of crew escape mechanism for the Shuttle a cou-
ple  of  years  ago.  I  can’t  remember  exactly  what  it  was.  It  seems
like it was $15 million, somewhere along there.

And  somewhere  along  the  way  we,  during  one  of  the  discussion
of  the  budgets  here,  we  found  out  they  had  third-based  some  of
that  money  to  send  John  Glenn—and  I  am  for  sending  old  people
up into space; I am all for that—but we got that finally place back
and the money spent, and NASA explained to us that a mechanism
just wasn’t feasible for the Shuttle, and that is disturbing to know,
but understanding the nature of the thing and the context and the
weight  of  it,  but  they  assured  us  that  it  is  going  to  be  part  of  the

this  crew-escape  system,  its  effect,  and  its  estimate  of  cost,  if  you
can.

77

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir. Thank you very much.
As  I  stated  in  my  testimony,  the  drivers  to  the  design  you  see
before  you  were  based  on  the  most  important  point  you  bring  up,
which  is  the  crew  getting  to  and  from  orbit.  That  requirement
drove  the  entire  design,  so  from  the  outset,  the  design  allows  for
safety. The Shuttle, as a magnificent vehicle as it is, its complexity,
and the fact of its basic layout, doesn’t allow for an effective escape
system.  This  vehicle,  the  escape  system  is  depicted  here  by  the
small  tower  on  the  top,  and  it  is  very  similar  to  what  you  may  re-
member  in  the  Apollo  era  which  was  tested  on  a  Little  Joe  rocket.
In fact, we just had meeting today to go over the design of the sys-
tem that will test that escape system, which will be the first major
test.

That system is called the launch abort system, and it is designed
in the vehicle so that if you—first you design a very reliable vehicle
you  hope  never  has  a  bad  day.  That  gets  your  chances  up.  Then
if you have a bad day, you have a plan B. And we had some of the
world’s best safety and reliably experts looking at all of the design
trades.  We  went  through  20,000  to  40,000  of  those,  and  the  pre-
diction  is  that  this  vehicle  will  enjoy,  at  least,  an  order  of  mag-
nitude improvement in crew safety compare to our current Shuttle
system.

And  it  is  built  into  the  cost  estimate  of  the  CEV.  Part  of  what
you  get  with  the  CEV  contract  is  the  capsule  and  its  service  mod-
ule,  its  adapter,  and  the  launch  abort  system;  it  is  all  part  of  that
entire contract, so you get all of that with this contract.

Mr. HALL. And the estimate of the cost of the safety equipment?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  I  will  have  to  take  that  for  the  record.  I  do
not  know  the  exact  breakdown  of  the  launch  escape  system,  but  I
can get those numbers for you.

[The information follows:]
NASA  does  not  currently  track  Orion  CEV  costs  in  a  way  that  allows  the  deter-
mination  of  the  cost  of  the  Launch  Abort  System  and  other  components.  NASA  is
currently  working  with  the  Orion  Prime  Contractor  on  a  contract  modification  that
will, among other things, modify the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to allow col-
lection  of  costs  by  Service  Module,  Crew  Module  and  Launch  Abort  System.  This
work  will  be  complete  in  the  early  spring  2007  to  support  the  activities  for  the  FY
2009 budget cycle.

Mr. HALL. Now, you are going to hear a lot from us about safety
from  this  point  forward,  and  I  think  you  expect  that,  and  I  think
you  encourage  it.  And  I  do,  once  again,  feel  good  with  you  where
you  are,  and  thank  you  for  you  service  to  this  committee,  to  this
Congress, and to this country. And I yield back.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Thank you, sir.
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Ehlers.

PERFORMANCE MARGIN

Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  First  of  all  in  response
to  the  question  asked  by  Mr.  Rohrabacher  asked  a  bit  earlier,  I
have  a  different  perspective,  but  for  the  same  question,  basically.
And I think a basic problem, Mr. Rohrabacher, is it is usual story
of Congress wanting more than it is willing to pay for. And I think

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00081 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

we  have  given  NASA—put  them  in  a  horrible  vise,  saying  yes,  we
want to finish the Space Station. Yes, we want to keep the Shuttle
flying.  Yes,  we  want  the  CEV.  And  we  don’t  want  you  to  cut  any-
thing  else.  But  in  fact,  they  can’t  do  that.  So  we  see  Aeronautics
being cut at a very crucial time when our air traffic control system,
badly,  over  the  next  decade,  is  going  to  need  huge  revamping.  The
FAA  simply  cannot  do  it  themselves;  they  were  depending  on
NASA.

And  so  that  leaves  us  an  unresolved  issue.  In  addition,  the  lack
of funding for the many science experiments we can do, the various
robotic  devices,  which  as  you  know,  cost  much  less  than  human
space exploration, this is not a criticism of you, Dr. Horowitz. It is
a  criticism  of  Congress  for  having  a  bigger  wish  list  than  their
pocketbook.  But  I  think  that  is  left  you  in  a  bit  of  a  conundrum.
But I am concerned; I still remember the X–33.

I  made  a  trip  to  California  on  behalf  of  the  Committee.  Several
of  the  Members  here  were  along.  I  came  home  from  that  trip  con-
vinced it would never work. I talked to people about it. The project
went  on.  Finally  it  was  killed.  I  think  your  final  net  investment
and  loss  was  between  $2  and  $3  billion.  I  am  very  worried  about
making  these  great  predictions  on  the  basis  of  something  that  you
are not very far along. And I realize that you are using a tried and
true method, but there are still problems when you put it together,
when you add an extra stage to the Ares I rocket, et cetera.

One  concern  I  have  is  it  is  my  understanding—and  I  may  be
wrong.  If  so,  I  would  be  delighted  to  be  corrected.  My  under-
standing  is  that  you  want  a  performance  margin  between  the
weight  of  the  rocket  and  its  thrust,  about  an  excess  thrust  of  20
percent  for  normal  rockets  and  30  percent  for  Human-Rated  Rock-
et.  Is  that  correct,  or  is  there  a  different  performance  margin  that
you  are  current  planning  to  achieve  with  the  Orion  plus  the  Ares
rocket?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  thank  you  for  that  question.  I  also  went  out
to California and visited the X–33 and had the very same feelings.
It  was  trying  to  violate  the  laws  of  physics,  and  that  is  expensive.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Well,  that  was  interesting,  and  I  got  into  an  argu-
ment  with  the  engineers  there,  and  they  just  kept  insisting  I  just
didn’t understand.

Dr. HOROWITZ. I got the same response.
Mr. EHLERS. And I asked them for a response in writing so they
could  take  time  to  clarify  it  for  a  poor,  ignorant  physicist,  and  the
letter made no sense either.

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  And  I  was  a  poor,  ignorant  aerospace  engineer,

and they treated me the same way.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Mr.  Ehlers,  just  for  the  record,  there  was  an
alternative  to  that  project  in  the  DC–X,  which  was  supposed  to  be
manufactured in my district, and the last administration chose the
riskier proposition instead, let me note.

Mr. EHLERS. At any rate, back to the performance margin.
Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir. Let me discuss a little bit about perform-

ance margin. And I appreciate that question.

The  way  we  treat  performance  margin  is  several  ways.  The
launch vehicle itself has margins, so we will ask the vehicle to lift,
say,  50,000  to  a  certain  orbit.  The  project  manager  for  the  launch

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

79

vehicle  is  keeping  performance  margin  for  his  launch  vehicle,  so
the vehicle may be able to lift 50,000 pounds, and his margin is on
the order of about 15 percent or so for the launch vehicle. We also
have margin that the CEV project manager has to hold on his side
in case his vehicle gets large, also.

The  integrated  margin,  right  now,  is  for  the  total  Moon  mission,
not  just  the  low  Earth  orbit.  We  have  huge  margins  to  get  to  low
Earth  orbit.  But  to  be  able  to  carry  up  to  the  lunar  mission,  ap-
proaching  20/20  at  this  point,  we  have  about  25  percent  perform-
ance margin on the amount of lift this vehicle can provide. And the
very  first  test  we  did  of  the  first  engine  component  showed  that  it
is exceeding its performance spec, but we are still going to keep the
margin  because  you  don’t  know  where  else  you  are  going  to  need
that margin.

Margin is very important in a program like this, and that is why
you  don’t  want  to  over  promise  and  say  you  only  have  one  percent
of  weight  margin  or  something.  That  is  not  realistic  in  this  pro-
gram.  We  do  have  sufficient  margins  for  working  on  the  program.
Mr.  EHLERS.  Let  me  just  tell  you  my  concern  on  this  because  I
have  seen  this  with  project  after  project  including  experiments  I
have worked on.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Right.
Mr.  EHLERS.  You  are  going  to  want  to  do  more  things:  you  are
going  to  want  to  have  more  in  the  launch  vehicle.  If  you  can  in-
crease the margin on your propulsion system, then you start losing
margin as you lose more goodies, perhaps an escape mechanism, to
the  capsule.  I  just  feel  very  nervous  about  the  margin  you  are
using  because  I  feel  that  is  what  might  disappear  as  you  go  thor-
ough the project and get lessened.

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  sir,  thank  you.  As  I  said,  again,  we  guard

the margins very closely.

One  of  the  nice  things,  for  example,  on  the  first  stage,  we  have
already  fired  that  engine.  We  know  what  it  can  do;  so  therefore,
you  have  margin  on  a  piece  of  equipment  you  already—so  there  is
no  much  risk  you  are  not—that  you  are  not  going  got  meet  your
performance  spec  even  though  you  have  the  extra  margin.  One  of
the things that will eat your margin is if you change your require-
ments. It comes back to the overall——

Mr.  EHLERS.  That  is  what  I  am  talking  about.  You  are  going  to
want  more  payload  because  you  are  going  to  think  of  extra  things
you are going to have to have for safety or other reasons.

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Yes,  sir.  And  since  we  have  already  included  the
escape system, the key thing that I have to do is maintain stability
for  the  program  by  not  letting  excess  requirements  creep  in  from
the  top  to  ask  the  program  to  do  more  than  the  have  the  margin
to protect. It is absolutely critical.

Mr. EHLERS. Actually, I think they will probably creep in the bot-

tom as well.

Dr. HOROWITZ. I shall work on that, too, sir.

ARES ROCKET DEVELOPMENT

Mr.  EHLERS.  Just  one  last  question:  do  you  think  that  adding  a
fifth  stage  to  the  Ares  rocket  is  a  straightforward  type  of  thing  or
do you anticipate some potential problems there?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

80

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  thanks,  I  appreciate  that  question.  I  believe

you are referring to the fifth segment on the first stage.

Mr. EHLERS. Yes, right.
Dr. HOROWITZ. The five-segment rocket booster was originally de-
signed  for  the  Shuttle  program  years  ago.  It  actually  was  devel-
oped,  and  a  five-segment  version  of  the  motor  was  tested  in  Octo-
ber  of  2003.  So  it  is  already  been  fired  and  tested,  and  even  using
components  that  were  still  the  old  four-segment  components  that
weren’t upgraded, they still had plenty of margin to fire the motor
and run it safely. So we believe that the risk to developing the five-
segment  is  very  low  because  we  have  already  fired  a  full-scale
motor.

Mr.  EHLERS.  And  what  propellants  are  you  talking  about  using?

I understand you are not——

Dr. HOROWITZ. We looked at that HT-type propellants and the P-
ban, and for safety and manufacturability and cost, we stayed with
the  P-ban.  If  for  some  reason,  you  wanted  to  go  to  a  higher  per-
formance  motor,  you  could  go  to  a  higher  performance  propellant,
but  in  the  overall  trade  for  the  cost-effectiveness  and  the  perform-
ance  requirement  and  the  manufacturability  and  the  safety,  we
stayed  with  the  P-ban,  which  is  what  we  currently  have  in  the
Shuttle solid rocket motor.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Okay,  I  have  a  multitude  of  other  questions,  but  I

have had more than enough time.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Okay.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  Mr.  Akin,  you  are

recognized.

PAYLOAD CAPACITY

Mr.  AKIN.  Thank  you.  I  apologize  for  coming  in  a  little  bit  late,
so I don’t know if I may be asking something that has already been
asked.  You  are  talking  about  going  with  the  smaller  model  than
you  have  there,  and  that  is  100  percent  solid  fuel  type  approach,
right?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  the  model  that  you  see  in  front  of  you,  the

first stage is solid rocket propellant.

Mr. AKIN. Okay.
Dr. HOROWITZ. The second stage is LOX hydrogen.
Mr.  AKIN.  Okay.  But  you  are  not  using  your  hydrogen  and  oxy-

gen until you get further up?

Dr. HOROWITZ. That is correct, sir.
Mr.  AKIN.  And  you  are  using,  what  was  it?  Ammonium  per-

chlorate? Or aluminum or something?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  That  is  the  basic  constituent  of  the  solid  rocket

propellant.

Mr. AKIN. Right. Yes.
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  It  is  the  same  one  we  use  in  the  Shuttle  today.
Mr. AKIN. Right.
Dr. HOROWITZ. It is referred to as a P-ban propellant.
Mr. AKIN. Now, does that mean that you are taking less payload
on  that  first  than  what  you  are  taking  currently,  or  how  does  the
actual size of these, scale-wise——

Dr. HOROWITZ. Sir, to relate it, I can relate it to the Space Shut-

tle, if that is what you would like.

Mr. AKIN. Yes.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

81

Dr. HOROWITZ. The payload being the Space Shuttle will bring up
about  30  to  40,000,  but  it  also  brings  up  200,000-pound  Space
Shuttle.

Mr. AKIN. Yes.
Dr. HOROWITZ. This launch vehicle, which is a solid rocket boost-
er, at its second stage, can lift about 50,000 pounds to orbit, which
is more than the payload being the Space Shuttle. To be able to go
to  the  Moon,  the  large  vehicle  that  you  see  to  your  left,  my  right,
that vehicle could lift about 260-, 270,000 to orbit, about 125 metric
tons, which is more than the Saturn 5 could lift to orbit.

Mr.  AKIN.  I  am  not  that  fast  with  the  numbers.  Compared  to
what we are lifting when we put a Shuttle up right now, the small-
er model that you have, will that lift that amount or not?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  that  will  lift  more  payload  than  the  Space

Shuttle can lift in its payload bay today.

Mr.  AKIN.  Right  today?  Then  the  bigger  one  is  going  to  be  quite

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  It  is  going  to  be  approximately  five  times  that

a number of times more?

much payload capacity.

Mr. AKIN. Five times more, okay. And the cost estimates and all,
you  have  got  that  reasonably  within  projecting/including  inflation
and all in numbers, and you still think you are——

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Yes,  sir.  We  do.  We  do  the  standard.  We  include
the stationary, and we include all costs, full costs accounting for all
of  the  NASA  workforce  and  all  of  the  infrastructure  and  all  of  the
development costs and all of the operations costs.

Mr. AKIN. I guess one last thing. I think I have still got another
nickel in the meter here time-wise. What is going to be the purpose
of  these  vehicles?  Is  it  mostly  just  getting  payload  up  into  orbit  or
are  you  staring  to  push  more  forward  than  that  and  does  that
change  the  design  of  what  you  are  doing?  Or  mostly  are  we  just
trying to put mass up to where we can start using it?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Sir, thanks for that question. That is the basic job
of  the  launch  vehicle,  to  get  you  to  orbit.  These  vehicles  were  de-
signed to get us to the Moon and then on to Mars, so the first vehi-
cle is optimized to get the crew to lower Earth orbit. The large ve-
hicle brings up all of the parts and pieces you need to, for example,
bring  a  lander  and  extra  fuel  to  get  you  to  the  Moon  or  to  bring
up the major parts you need when you eventually go to Mars some
day.

Mr.  AKIN.  We  use  a  jet-type  technology  to  move  the  vehicle
through  space.  Are  we  still  using  that?  Would  that  be  a  hydrogen/
oxygen type thing?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  we  have  several  different  types  of  engines.
The propulsion system that will propel you to the Moon, the engine
we will use is the same engine we will use on the second stage, so
we will use the same engine on the large vehicle, which is an oxy-
gen  and  hydrogen  rocket  engine  that  will  propel  the  whole  stack
to  the  Moon.  We  also  have  some  other  fuels  that  we  use  for
storability  for  long-term  storage  on  the  Moon  or  on  the  way  to
Mars.

Mr.  AKIN.  I  see,  and  basically  the  oxygen/hydrogen,  weight-wise,

gives you more performance than the solid does?

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

82

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir. The most efficient chemical propellant is
oxygen  and  hydrogen.  The  reason  we  don’t  use  it  on  the  lower
stages  as  much  is  it  is  not  as  much  thrust  even  though  it  is  more
fuel  efficient.  As  you  get  further  from  the  earth,  you  want  a  more
efficient fuel.

Mr. AKIN. I got it. So there are benefits of both, depending where

you are using it.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Absolutely.
Mr. AKIN. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Udall.

MORE ON GAO’S RESPONSE TO NASA CHANGES

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Li,  NASA—and  Dr.
Horowitz,  I  tell  you,  I  want  to  give  you  a  chance  to  reply  as  well.
NASA  asserts  that  implementing  GAO’s  acquisition  approach
would  delay  the  delivery  of  the  CEV  and  increase  costs.  Do  you
agree or disagree and why?

Mr.  LI.  I  think  this  goes  back  to  our  initial  point.  I  think  NASA
chose  to  interpret  our  recommendation  as  necessarily  taking  two
vendors and continuing with two. That is one way in which you can
meet  our  recommendation.  Now,  obviously,  if  you  have  two  ven-
dors,  it  is  going  to  cost  more.  But  I,  again,  going  back  to  my  anal-
ogy  of  what  my  youth  is  with  automobiles.  The  logo  was  pay  me
now  or  pay  me  later,  and  I  think  in  this  particular  case,  having
more  knowledge  would  have  reduced  those  costs  in  the  future
years.

Now, there are other options that NASA could have taken. They
took  one  which  they  decided  to  make  options  Schedule  B  and
Schedule  C.  But  I  still  believe  that  they  went  further  than  we
would  have  liked;  they  would  have  been  better  served  to  only  go
through what we call preliminary design review. So from that per-
spective, it is very difficult to say whether or not those costs would
be greater.

In terms of schedule, again, it goes back to that issue of are you
going  to  have  problems.  I  think  that  past  history  has  shown,  and
with our experience looking at many DOD programs, the fact of the
matter  is  if  you  don’t  have  that  knowledge,  that  is  going  to  come
back to bite you later on.

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you.  I  am  not  sure  Dr.  Horowitz  used  Fram
on this car. You remodeled it and you reengineered it. You are free
to  respond  to  the  questions,  but  I  also  want  to  throw  another  one
at  you,  which  is  can  you  provide  your  best  quantitative  estimates
of  the  size  of  the  delay  and  cost  estimates  if,  in  fact,  the  assertion
you make is—were to hold fast?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  sir,  thanks  for  allowing  me  to  respond  to
that  question.  The  first  issue  that  Mr.  Li  brings  up  was  actually,
in  my  opinion,  was  just  a  failure  to  communicate.  You  can  see
there  was  some  misunderstanding  of  our  interpretation  of  his  re-
port,  and  that  is  why  it  was  important  for  us  to  sit  down  and  get
together  and  we  did  make  some  modifications,  like  he  pointed  out.
We added the options B and C.

The  important  thing  for  us  is  as  we  went  through  the  design
analysis  cycles,  a  couple  of  things  were  happening.  We  had  two
contractor  teams  on  board  in  a  competitive  environment,  and  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

83

is  always  good  to  have  competition  to  keep  costs  down.  What  we
ran into was the designs had converged to the point that there was
no new knowledge in the designs. We had got to the point that we
weren’t learning very much more about the designs, and in fact, be-
cause  of  the  competitive  enviroment,  we  couldn’t  even  discuss
things with our contractor team.

There  are  only  so  many  rocket  scientists  in  this  country,  and
they  exist  in  a  couple  of  big  companies  and  NASA,  so  we  wanted
to get the team formed as soon as possible to help us work through
all  of  the  final  design  to  get  us  to  the  preliminary  design  review
which doesn’t occur until 2008. So we wanted to get the contractor
team  on  board  in  order  to  do  that.  Now,  if  we  kept  one  contractor
on  and  didn’t  award  them  the  contract  to  go  past  the  preliminary
design  review,  then  I  would  have  been  negotiating  a  contract  in  a
noncompetitive environment, which I don’t believe would have been
in  the  best  interest  of  the  government.  So  those  are  the  factors  in
our strategy of whom we approached this problem.

Mr.  UDALL.  Are  you  in  a  position  to  answer  further,  perhaps  for
the  record,  my  questions  about  a  quantitative  estimate  of  the  size
and  the  delay  and  the  cost  estimates  that  might  be  a  part  of  it?
Dr. HOROWITZ. Sir, I don’t have the exact—I can take that for the

record and get back to you——

[The information follows:]
In  May  2005,  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS)  was  initiated
with  one  of  its  tasks  to  provide  a  complete  assessment  of  the  top-level  Orion  CEV
requirements. As a result of ESAS, the architecture and the top level requirements
for the Orion CEV were chosen, and made part of the Phase 2 competition. At that
point,  NASA  saw  no  benefit  of  keeping  two  prime  contractors  through  Preliminary
Design  Review  (PDR)  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $1  billion  each  (as  in  a  spiral  ap-
proach).  Rather,  NASA  saw  a  better  return  of  its  investment  in  competitively
issuing  two  Phase  1  Orion  CEV  Prime  Contracts  for  conceptual  design  and  trade
studies against the ESAS architecture for an estimated cost of $46 million each.

Mr. UDALL. You will take that for the record.
Mr.  LI.  Mr.  Udall,  when  we,  specifically,  asked  NASA  to  be  able
to  quantify  that,  they  told  us  that  they  did  not  do  that  analysis;
so therefore, I do not feel confident that they could have made that
particular assertion.

Mr. UDALL. Do you think we ought to ask them to make that as-

sertion?

Mr.  LI.  Well,  I  think  it  is  water  over  the  dam  at  this  point  in
time,  but  my  point  is  that  in  order  to  make  an  assertion  of  delays
and of extra costs, those should come from analysis, and I don’t be-
lieve that that analysis was done.

Mr. UDALL. Perhaps the Committee ought to take that under re-
view  ourselves,  and  we  may  want  to  ask  that  NASA  actually  com-
plete  those  analyses  for  us,  but  that  is  another  day,  another  story
at some point.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir.
Mr. UDALL. If I could, just for the record—I see my time is about
to  expire,  and  I  could  get  another  from  Mr.  Akin,  perhaps—but  I
am curious why you decided to fundamentally change your acquisi-
tion approach, that is, for the CEV after doing a spiral development
approach  for  the  first  year-and-a-half.  And  what  was  wrong  with
the original acquisition approach?

NASA  changed  its  acquisition  approach  from  the  previous  ‘‘spiral  development’’
approach  to  reduce  technical,  cost,  and  schedule  risk.  Spiral  development  is  a  proc-
ess to achieve a desired capability where the end-state requirements are not known
at program initiation. Spiral development was based on an undefined transportation
architecture.  Subsequent  comprehensive  requirements  definition  and  independent
assessments  defined  an  architecture  and  showed  that  a  continued  spiral  approach
would  no  longer  fit,  as  it  would  increase  cost,  schedule,  and  technical  risk.  NASA
made  a  decision  to  spend  its  resources  in  developing  its  exploration  transportation
end-state  requirements  and  architecture  for  Exploration  through  a  number  of  par-
allel efforts for the formulation phase of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)
project.  The  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155)  also  directed  NASA  to
pursue a Shuttle-derived transportation system to support a sustained human pres-
ence on the Moon and ability to support future destinations. This approach was also
the one chosen through doing trade studies.

In  May  2005,  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS)  was  initiated
with  one  of  its  tasks  to  provide  a  complete  assessment  of  the  top-level  Orion  CEV
requirements. As a result of ESAS, the architecture and the top level requirements
for the Orion CEV were chosen, and made part of the Phase 2 competition. At that
point,  NASA  saw  no  benefit  of  keeping  two  prime  contractors  through  Preliminary
Design  Review  (PDR)  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $1  billion  each  (as  in  a  spiral  ap-
proach).  Rather,  NASA  saw  a  better  return  of  its  investment  in  competitively
issuing  two  Phase  1  Orion  CEV  Prime  Contracts  for  conceptual  design  and  trade
studies against the ESAS architecture for an estimated cost of $46 million each.

Additionally,  NASA  established  an  intra-agency  Orion  CEV  Smart  Buyer  team
which performed trade studies and design analysis that was used by the Orion CEV
Project  Office  to  understand  and  verify  the  appropriateness  of  the  requirements  in-
corporated  into  the  Orion  CEV  Phase  2  solicitation  and  evaluation  of  proposals.
With  knowledge  gained  from  ESAS,  the  Smart  Buyer  team,  and  Orion  CEV  Phase
1  contracts,  NASA  was  in  a  position  to  ‘‘down  select’’  to  a  single  Prime  contractor
and  initiate  the  Design,  Development,  and  Test  and  Evaluation  (DDT&E)  contract
for  the  Orion  CEV  in  order  to  baseline  an  industry  approach  and  commitment  to
meet the desired outcomes of the Orion CEV project. This new acquisition approach
provides  NASA  with  the  capability  to  shorten  the  gap  in  human  space  flight  capa-
bility with the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2010. The original ‘‘spiral develop-
ment’’  acquisition  approach  contained  significant  risk  that  this  nation  would  not
have  a  human  space  flight  capability  by  2014  with  a  higher  development  cost  of
close to $1 billion.

And  maybe,  Mr.  Li,  you  could  comment  later  for  the  record  as
well.  Do  you  have  any  view  regarding  the  relative  merits  of  those
two  approaches?  And  when  I  say  for  the  record,  I  don’t  know  if
maybe the Chairman wants to cut me off and you could do it writ-
ing later or whether he is willing to have you do it here, now.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Certainly.

MORE ON INTEGRATION CHALLENGES

Mr.  CALVERT.  I  thank  the  gentleman.  Also,  just  for  the  record,
Dr.  Horowitz,  the  capsule,  itself,  would  that  capsule  be  capable  to
have interaction with the Space Station if necessary?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir, absolutely. The capsule can dock with ve-
hicle  that  has  a  compatible  docking  station,  so  it  can  go  to  the
Space Station.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Let  us  talk  about  what  the  long  pole  on  the  tent
is in this whole program. You know, moving this thing along, even
though we are using existing technology, obviously, it is a complex
engineering  problem.  If  you  had  to  take  one  element  to  this  that
you consider the long pole in the ten, what would it be?

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Sir,  right  now,  the  long  pole  the  critical  path,
would  be  the  J–2X  engine  on  the  second  stage;  it  is  leading  the
pack.

Mr. CALVERT. And why is that the case?

85

Dr.  HOROWITZ.  The  J–2X  engine,  while  the  engine  is  a  derivate
of the J–2 that flew in the Apollo mission, we have to redo the tool-
ing  and  the  manufacturing  and  bring  the  engine  up  to  today’s
standards.  The  lead  time  for  components,  for  example,  valves,  if
you  want  to  order  just  abilitative  metal  to  make  these  cryogenic
valves,  there  is  at  least  a  three-year  lead  time  on  some  of  those
components,  so  the  development  and  the  amount  of  testing  to  get
it to our standards make that engine unavailable until 2012.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Is  there  any  way  that  that  can  work  out  any
quicker  than  the  2012  timeline  or  is  that  a  conservative  estimate?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  sir,  we  will  have  engines  in  the  test  stand
before 2012, but just because of the amount of testing and the lead
time on articles, you could put a lot of money in and accelerate the
program  a  few  months,  but  there  is  no  way  to  accelerate  that  en-
gine, say, one or two years earlier just because of the lead time re-
quired  and  the  testing  required  to  get  it  up  to  the  standards  we
want.

tive?

Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Li, what would you identify from your perspec-

Mr.  LI.  From  my  perspective,  obviously,  Dr.  Horowitz  has  a  lot
more of the technical knowledge of the design. You know, NASA is
designing  them.  From  my  perspective,  from  a  management  per-
spective,  I  am  the  most  worried  about  them  succumbing  to,  per-
haps,  of  both  money  and  time,  and  maybe  bypassing  and  short-
changing  what  I  would  consider  to  be  some  basic,  sound  systems
engineering  practicing,  and  that  is  making  sure  that  you  do  the
testing,  making  sure  that  there  are  certain  reviews  that  are  done.
In  preparation  for  this  hearing,  I  was  going  through  some  of  my
old  papers  of  some  of  the  things  that  have  occurred  at  NASA,  and
I  recollect  things  such  as  the  unfortunate  occurrence  with  Mars
Polar  Lander  where,  in  that  particular  case,  where  because  of  the
desire  to  cut  costs,  they  did  not  do  a  full-up  test,  and  as  a  result,
there  are  some  issues  associated  with  spurious  signals  that  made
the  spacecraft  think  that  it  was  closer  than  what  it  was  and  it
crashed.  I  think  that  that  is,  to  me,  the  thing  that  I  worry  about
the  most,  is  allowing  those  pressures  to  make  one  to  make  some
decision  from  a  systems-engineering  perspective  and  short-change
them.

MORE ON INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION

Mr. CALVERT. And we hope that that would not occur, but on one
hand,  if  I  look  back  on  history,  back  when  John  F.  Kennedy  first
made  his  speech  that  we  will  go  to  the  Moon,  and  from  the  time
that  we  had  that  speech  to  the  time  that  we  went  to  the  Moon,  it
was probably less time than we are talking about between now and
the  launch  in  2014,  and  this  was  something  that  was  done  a  long
time  ago.  Many  people  in  the  audience  weren’t  even  alive  at  the
time. And in this country, some comments I hear when I go around
the country, been there, done that. Why are we doing it again? And
it  is  interesting  that  we  forgot  how.  We  cannot  do  that  today.  We
do  not  have  the  technology  today  to  do  that  kind  of  endeavor,  and
now we are striving to move back forward again. And unlike 1969,
we  are  looking  in  the  rearview  mirror,  and  we  have  other  people

right  on  our  tailpipe,  using  the  car  analogy  again.  Mr.  Rohr-
abacher?

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  I  think  that  in  1969,  if  you  remember,
we  did  have  a  race  with  the  Russians  at  that  time,  and  we  were
looking  in  the  rearview  mirror.  And  luckily  for  the  Chinese,  we
have——

Mr. CALVERT. They weren’t going to the Moon, though.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. And luckily for the Chinese, we have diverted
enough  technology  to  them  over  the  last  ten  years  in  order  to  pro-
vide  them  excellent  missile  and  rocket  and  technology  so  they  are
in  our  rearview  mirror.  Let  us  make  sure,  I  would  hope,  as  our
NASA director visits the Chinese—as he is, I believe, right now, as
I speak—I hope that he remember the last time we tried to cooper-
ate  with  the  Chinese.  It  wasn’t  to  our  benefit.  In  terms—I  re-
minded  Mr.  Ehlers  that  the  X–33  program  that  he  was  talking
about  that  Mr.  Horowitz  and  I  talked  about  in  my  office  the  other
day,  that  program  spent,  I  think,  $1  billion-and-a-half  dollars,  and
that  was,  interestingly  enough,  being  built  by  the  same  company
that  has  been  given  the  contract  for  this  project.  Let  us  hope  that
that  is  not  repeated,  and  we  are  going  to  watch  that  very  closely.

MORE CEV BUDGET CONCERNS

I  agree  with  Mr.  Ehlers  that,  certainly,  robotics  is  a  cheaper
method  than  building  things  that  are  capable  of  human  space
flight.  But  I  understand,  Mr.  Horowitz,  and  you  may  correct  me  if
I  am  wrong,  that  this  overall  project  will  include  the  use  of  robot-
ics, and is designed to actually use robotics to facilitate some of the
missions  that  we  are  going  to  then  end  up  putting  men,  or  should
I say human beings, after the robots have led the way. That, itself,
is, I am sure, cost-saving a certain amount of money because of the
expense of taking care of contingencies.

I  want  to  compliment  NASA  and  Mike  Griffin  for  the  concept  of
using  technology  that  is  already  tested  and  proven  for  significant
parts  of  this  new  project,  because  as  you  say,  that  in  it  self  has
saved  an  enormous  amount  of  money  and  time  because  you  know
there  are  large  numbers  of  parts  of  these  projects  that  work  be-
cause  they  have  already  worked.  Integrating  them  has  not  been
tested yet, and that is part of it.

So  I  think  Mr.  Chairman,  we  should  be  recognizing  this  stren-
uous effort to try to us that as a means of keeping down costs. But
still,  with  all  of  that  said,  the  cost  does  seem  to  be  rather  high,  so
I  do  not  understand  why  it  costs  so  much,  especially  if  you  have
so many parts that have been already used and tested, why it costs
$31  billion  to  get  to  the  point  where  we  are  going  to  have  one  of
those rockets. Thirty-one billion dollars is a lot of money, and here,
just  to  get  to  that  point,  to  get  that  rocket  launched,  it  is  $31  bil-
lion,  is  it  not?  That  is  as  of  today.  That  is  if  all  of  Mr.  Li’s  fears
don’t come true, and the costs don’t go up after that.

Dr. HOROWITZ. Sir, if you like, I will take that question, and the
$31  billion  number  that  you  mentioned  in  the  integrated  cost  for
all  of  exploration  through  our  budget  run-out.  That  includes  all  of
the robotics——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay, but that is not just that——
Dr. HOROWITZ. That is not just this, sir——

87

Mr. ROHRABACHER. I am glad I asked that question.
Dr. HOROWITZ. I am sorry.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. How much is it just for that rocket?
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Well,  I  can,  like  I  said,  I  will  take  that  for  the
record. I can get you a breakdown of every component that we have
and  the  cost  estimation  of  every  single  component  and  where  the
money is being spent.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  No,  I  just  want  to  know  basically.  I  don’t

need every component.
Dr. HOROWITZ. Right.
[The information follows:]
Launch vehicle costs for the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle through the first human
launch,  currently  projected  late  in  FY  2014,  are  approximately  $10.8  billion.  This
number  excludes  the  Orion  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  mission  and  ground  oper-
ations  and  facility  modifications,  and  program  integration  and  other  program-level
costs.  Orion  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  project  costs  through  first  human  flight  are
about $10.3 billion. Therefore, combined Ares I and Orion project costs through first
human  launch  are  about  $21.1  billion.  If  related  required  programmatic  and  non-
flight  hardware  costs  are  included  in  the  estimate,  it  will  cost  about  $33.5  billion
to get to the point of first human launch projected in 2014.

All  of  these  numbers  include  reserves,  but  exclude  Corporate  G&A.  These  num-
bers  include  estimates  for  FYs  2012,  2013,  and  2014,  which  lie  beyond  the  budget
horizon.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  When  that  rocket  is  launched,  I  want  to
know  how  much  it  is  going  to  cost  to  get  us  from  here  to  there.  Is
it $5 billion? Is it $10? I am glad you just straightened out the $31
billion  number  for  me.  That  is  what  these  hearings  are  all  about.
Dr.  HOROWITZ.  Yes,  sir.  And  we  will  break  it  down  any  way  you
like. If you would like just the integrated stack, I can get you that
cost or the launch cost to launch it or the total infrastructure.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. When we launch that first rocket, how much
does  it  cost?  That  is  what  we  want  to  know,  how  are  we  going  to
get from here to there. That will be very helpful.

Dr. HOROWITZ. I will be more than happy to bring those numbers

to you.

MORE INTEGRATION CHALLENGES

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  thank  you  very  much,  and  I  want  to
thank  Chairman  Boehlert,  and  of  course,  Chairman  Calvert  for
their leadership, and I am looking forward to working with you and
following this project to make sure—Remember this: we are facing
$3  billion  right  down  the  toilet  because  they  based  it  on  that  sys-
tem  and  taking,  building,  spending  the  money  before  they  had  a
piece  of  technology  that  worked,  and  then  it  never  did  work.  And
you are telling us that that is not going to happen in this program
because everything works. Is that right?

Dr. HOROWITZ. Yes, sir.
Mr. ROHRABACHER. Okay, is that your reading, Mr. Li?
Mr.  LI.  I  still  think  I  disagree  somewhat,  and  I  still  think  there
are  some  technologies  that  are  being  developed.  The  landing  sys-
tem, it is my understanding, is still something that has not reached
the technology readiness level that they would like at this point in
time, so I still think there is some issue there.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So  you  have  got  some  worries.  We  are  going

to follow this. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Udall, do you have any

additional questions?

MORE BUDGET CONCERNS

Mr.  UDALL.  I  don’t  know  if  you  want  to  give  me  a  third  chance

here, Mr. Chairman.

One question, for the record, Mr. Li. I know we have talked quite
a  bit  about  whether  you  are  being  too  conservative  and  not  ade-
quately  accounting  for  the  CEV  and  the  CLV  program’s  use  of  ex-
isting  technology  in  their  designs,  which  NASA  says  considerably
reduces  the  risk.  But  what  you  know  now  of  NASA’s  approach,  do
you accept NASA’s assessment of these risks, and if now, why not.
And I know you have talked of this quite a bit during the hearing,
but if I could get it on the record.

Mr.  LI.  Well,  again,  I  understand  that  there  are  a  lot  of  compo-
nents  that  have  been  used  before.  But  as  NASA  will  say  them-
selves,  we  are  talking  about  new  processes.  It  is  new  technology.
It  would  be  foolish  to  take  technology  that  was  used  on  the  Apollo
and  put  it  in  this  particular  vehicle.  We  are  talking  about  smaller
things  that  probably  do  the  same  things;  but  however,  when  you
shrink  things  into  a  smaller  size,  that  is  when  you  run  the  risk  of
having some problems. So yes, I understand functionally that there
are  some  things  that  we  have  proven  when  you  bring  it  down  to
form, fit and function, that is when I worry.

Mr. UDALL. Thank you. If you have other thoughts as the weeks
unfold,  we  would  appreciate  any  additional  comments  in  the
record. Again, thanks to the witnesses.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Well,  if  we  have  no  further  questions,  we  are——
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Could  I  add  one  thing  for  the  record,  Mr.
Chairman?  And  that  is  Mr.  Li,  over  the  years,  has  been  a  tremen-
dous source of information and guidance for this, and we thank you
very much, Mr. Li, for that.

Mr.  CALVERT.  We  thank  you  for  your  service.  Thank  you  very

much. We are adjourned.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Scott  J.  Horowitz,  Associate  Administrator,  Exploration  Systems  Mis-

sion Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. During  your  testimony,  you  identified  ‘‘systems  integration’’  as  a  difficult  part
of Orion and Ares development. Are there particular areas that you can already
identify  as  potentially  problematic?  Where  might  problems  arise  and  when
might those become apparent?

A1. NASA  recognizes  that  systems  integration  will  be  critical  to  the  success  of
Orion  and  Ares  development.  To  help  deal  with  the  challenge,  the  Orion  and  Ares
projects  are  structured  based  upon  the  formal  NASA  Procedural  Requirements
(NPR)  of  NPR  7120.5  (Program  and  Project  Management  Processes  and  Require-
ments)  and  NPR  7123.1  (Systems  Engineering  Procedural  Requirements).  These
Agency technical procedures provide best practice guidance, including systems engi-
neering,  for  all  programs  and  projects  to  adhere  to.  NPR  7123  requires  each  pro-
gram  to  maintain  an  approved  System  Engineering  Management  Plan  (SEMP)  to
control  the  life  cycle  technical  management  process.  The  Constellation  Program
SEMP  establishes  the  approaches  for  integrating  and  organizing  People,  Products/
Orion/Ares, and Processes for successfully achieving the requirements.

There are no known problematic systems engineering areas at this time. The Con-
stellation  Program  has  established  and  is  executing  a  rigorous  Risk  Management
process  to  identify,  control,  and  mitigate  risks  at  the  earliest  time  possible.  This
Risk  Management  process  is  being  used  effectively  by  the  Program  on  Orion  and
Ares  development  and  integration  efforts  in  the  areas  such  as  design,  analysis,  re-
quirements,  test  &  verification  (T&V),  and  manufacturing.  This  Risk  Management
process  identified  two  early  development  risks:  performance  of  the  integrated
Launch  Abort  System  and  Command  Module,  and  performance  of  the  integrated
CEV and CLV during ascent. These risk concerns are expected to decrease over time
because  they  were  identified  early,  and  risk  mitigation  plans  will  be  implemented
to reduce these risks.

Systems  integration  for  a  program  of  this  caliber  is  challenging.  To  counter  and
manage any unexpected integration related challenges, the program is using the for-
mal  processes  and  procedures  required  by  NPR  7120.5  and  NPR  7123.  As  such,  a
challenge  could  become  apparent  during  vigorous  T&V,  which  is  being  designed  by
the  Program  to  capture  and  resolve  any  unexpected  development  or  integration  re-
lated challenges at the earliest. For example, the Flight Test Strategy calls for early
T&V of progressively mature test article configurations leading to the first planned
flight test in 2009. Any challenges that arise during the T&V will be resolved before
they become apparent risks to the overall success of Orion, Ares and the Constella-
tion program.
Q2. What are the most likely additional design changes that could be made to Orion

in the future, and could they be absorbed in current budget estimates?

A2. Orion  is  currently  in  the  formulation  stage  of  the  project.  The  specific  details
of the design will continue to mature until the design is finalized at the Critical De-
sign  Review  (CDR).  However,  a  number  of  major  design  areas  have  already  been
established, and, therefore, budget risk of future changes is low. Consequently, not-
withstanding  the  maturity  of  the  design,  NASA  currently  believes  that  it  has  the
budget to develop Orion.
Q3. How many technology and cost threats are currently being carried by Orion? The
Ares  I  upper-stage?  The  Ares  I  first  stage?  NASA’s  notification  to  Congress  on
its  intent  to  begin  development  of  Orion  states  that  NASA  has  identified  no
‘‘areas  in  the  CEV  [Crew  Exploration  Vehicle]  concept  where  the  technology  is
immature.’’  Would  you  assess  the  Ares  vehicle  similarly?  Does  this  assessment
suggest that the current technology and cost risks are very unlikely to occur?

A3. The Ares I has minimal technology development activities due to the extensive
use  of  heritage  hardware.  However,  there  are  certain  components  of  the  Upper
Stage that may require advanced development, such as the Reaction Control System
(RCS) thrusters, Thrust Vector Control (TVC) systems, and various main propulsion
system  (MPS)  components.  All  are  within  acceptable  technology  readiness  levels  to
be inserted into the project without risk.

Cost threats associated with Ares I exist due to the transition between the Shuttle
Program  close-out  and  Constellation  Program  ramp-up.  Although  synergy  between

91

the  Shuttle  program  and  Ares  I  helps  the  transition,  it  also  presents  a  challenge.
Budgets  and  schedules  tend  to  be  contingent  on  each  other.  The  challenge  comes
as  Orion  ramps  up  and  Shuttle  is  still  operating  at  full  strength  in  support  of  mis-
sions to ISS. Even with the best of transition planning, there may be issues related
to  Shuttle  program  close-out  activities  that  may  impact  Ares  I  development  activi-
ties.

The  Orion  vehicle  relies  on  proven  technologies  for  its  design  implementation.
However,  there  are  two  areas  where  NASA  felt  that  it  was  appropriate  to  begin
early  advanced  development  work  prior  to  the  award  of  the  Prime  contract.  These
areas are the Thermal Protection System and the Landing System. As a part of this
development work, NASA has performed analysis and testing on materials and sub-
system components for these two systems.

Orion is subject to the cost risks associated with the normal unknowns of any de-
velopment  project.  However,  NASA  has  put  management  tools  in  place  to  identify
and address those risks.
Q4. How  many  ‘‘end  item’’  milestone  awards  are  included  in  each  schedule  of  the

Orion contract and what is the approximate value of those awards?

A4. The base contract contains nine milestone periods where the contractor may re-
ceive  award  fee  payments.  The  maximum  fee  available  varies,  depending  on  the
milestone,  and  generally  the  later  milestones  have  larger  fee  amounts.  The  first
evaluation period ends at the Systems Design Review (SDR), and the maximum fee
amount  for  this  period  is  $19,438,745.  The  largest  maximum  fee  amount  is
$149,515,277  for  the  period  ending  with  the  delivery  of  the  first  flight  vehicle.  [It
should be noted that all fee’s considered a provisional payment. The final award fee
amount  will  be  made  based  on  the  contractor’s  performance  over  the  entire  period
of performance.]

An  ‘‘End  Item’’  award  fee  contract  is  being  used  in  the  Orion  contract  in  order
to  measure  the  true  quality  of  contractor  performance  at  the  end  of  the  contract.
Therefore,  the  total  contract  award  fee  pool  is  available  and  the  contractor’s  total
performance  is  evaluated  against  the  award  fee  plan  to  determine  total  earned
award fee. In addition to the final evaluation, interim evaluations are done to mon-
itor performance prior to contract completion in order to provide feedback to the con-
tractor  on  the  Government’s  assessment  of  the  quality  of  the  contractor’s  perform-
ance,  and  to  establish  the  basis  for  making  interim  award  fee  payments.  These  in-
terim  award  fee  assessments  are  done  at  key  milestone  periods  in  the  contract.
Therefore  all  fee  paid  during  the  contract  are  considered  interim  payments.  A  final
award  fee  determination  will  be  made,  based  on  the  contractor’s  performance  over
the  entire  contract,  which  will  determine  the  award  fee  amount  earned  by  the  con-
tractor for the contract.
Q5. Given  that  the  Ares  I  is  also  in  the  very  early  stages  of  development,  how  can
NASA  be  confident  that  the  rocket  will  perform  well  enough  to  support  the  cur-
rent  design  of  Orion?  In  your  testimony,  you  said  that  the  program  carried
roughly  25  percent  margin,  combining  the  vehicle  performance  and  payload
mass margins for a lunar mission. Specifically, you said:
The  launch  vehicle  itself  has  margins,  so  we  will  ask  the  vehicle  to  lift,  say
50,000  pounds  to  a  certain  orbit.  The  project  manager  for  the  launch  vehicle  is
keeping  performance  margin  for  his  launch  vehicle,  so  the  vehicle  may  be  able
to  lift  55,000  pounds,  and  his  margin  is  on  the  order  of  about  15  percent  or  so
for  the  launch  vehicle.  We  also  have  margin  that  the  CEV  project  manager  has
to  hold  on  his  side  in  case  his  vehicle  gets  larger,  also.  The  integrated  margin,
right now, for the total moon mission, not just the low-Earth orbit. We have huge
margins  to  get  to  low-Earth  orbit.  But  to  be  able  to  carry  up  to  the  lunar  mis-
sion,  approaching  2020  at  this  point,  we  have  about  25  percent  performance
margin on the amount of lift this vehicle can provide.
What is the individual margin for Ares performance and Orion mass for a lunar
mission? Furthermore, what is the current level of performance margin for Ares
I  to  deliver  Orion  to  an  orbit  equivalent  to  that  of  the  International  Space  Sta-
tion? What mass margin is currently held by Orion for an ISS rendezvous mis-
sion? How do these margins compare to margins held by previous launch vehicle
designs?

A5. Performance  margin  is  the  usable  performance  capability  reserved  to  protect
mission  injection  conditions.  The  Ares  I  design  team  is  using  validated  engineering
tools that are used to set the allocations to the elements for initial planning. These
tools are anchored in historical ‘as flown’ capabilities and tend to envelope loads and
weights. The Ares I Project currently has 15 percent margin reserved for uncertain-

92

ties  in  nominal  vehicle  parameters  or  their  dispersions  and  this  margin  is  used  to
protect vehicle capability requirements for modifications or a new design. This mar-
gin will be maintained to minimize the risk of failure to deliver Orion to its required
orbit, either ISS or for a lunar mission.

The Orion project uses a historically based ‘‘schedule’’ to determine weight growth
allowances  for  each  subsystem.  The  weight  growth  allowance  will  vary  depending
on  the  historical  risk  of  weight  growth  for  each  type  of  subsystem.  The  allowable
weight growth will also reduce over time as the design matures. For the lunar mis-
sion  Orion  is  carrying  approximately  15  percent  weight  growth  allowance.  In  addi-
tion,  Orion  has  allocated  another  10  percent  margin  that  is  carried  as  reserve.  For
Orion  the  lunar  case  is  the  most  challenging  from  a  weight  growth  perspective.
Therefore,  the  margins  for  a  potential  mission  to  the  Space  Station  are  lower  than
those listed above for the lunar mission.
Q6. In  a  letter  responding  to  §102  of  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005,  NASA
stated  that  ‘‘a  higher  than  expected  CEV  cost  would  simply  delay  CEV  develop-
ment  or  production. . .’’  Given  that  Orion  and  Ares  I  currently  consume  the
bulk  of  Exploration  funding  and  the  current  schedule  supports  operations  no
earlier  than  2014,  can  NASA  implement  its  go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay  philos-
ophy  for  the  program  while  meeting  the  President’s  deadline  of  a  2014  launch?
A6. At its early formulation stage, the Constellation Program is certain to face ‘‘un-
known  unknowns’’  as  we  continue  to  refine  requirements,  develop  advanced  tech-
nologies,  and  begin  to  integrate  the  various  systems  into  an  operational  infrastruc-
ture  to  enable  long-term  exploration  of  the  Moon  and  Mars.  When  Constellation
moves  into  the  implementation  phase,  after  Preliminary  Design  Review,  currently
scheduled for the spring of 2008, design, cost, and schedule baselines will be estab-
lished,  and  Program  performance  will  be  measured  against  metrics  established  at
the various key decision points throughout the life of the mission. It is at this junc-
ture  that  NASA  will  provide  Constellation  project  Life  Cycle  Cost  commitments  to
Congress.

Yet  even  before  these  baselines  are  established,  the  Constellation  Program  is  op-
erating  under  a  ‘‘go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay’’  constraint;  we  are  living  within  a  set
budget  profile,  and  any  growth  beyond  our  capacity  to  perform  trades,  de-scope,  or
apply  reserve  will  result  in  a  slip  to  the  baseline  schedule.  We  are  making  every
effort to avoid this through aggressive use of management tools at all phases of the
Program:  defining  and  controlling  requirements,  generating  realistic  cost  estimates
early  on  (ESAS),  employing  a  ‘‘smart  buyer’’  approach  to  major  acquisitions,  and
monitoring  performance  by  means  of  a  rigorous  earned  value  system.  Thus  far,  we
have been successful in achieving critical milestones within our budget profile.
Q7. When would a decision to exercise Options B and C need to be made to support
operations  in  2014  and  beyond?  At  the  time  NASA  decides  to  exercise  these  op-
tions, will the Ares I launch vehicle have completed Preliminary Design Review?
Will the Ares I have completed Critical Design Review?

A7. The  Orion  CEV  flight  units  necessary  for  the  first  human  launch  and  the  first
cargo launch are developed under Schedule A. The current contract states that Op-
tions  B  &  C  need  to  be  exercised  no  later  than  July  2009.  The  Orion  PDR  is  cur-
rently scheduled for March 2008 and the CDR is currently scheduled for April 2009.
The Ares I PDR is currently scheduled for April 2008 with CDR currently scheduled
for September 2009.
Q8. Has  the  Agency  or  its  contractors  identified  the  activities  needed  to  support
PDR? What post-PDR activities are currently being pursued by NASA or its con-
tractors? What is the cost of these activities?

A8. The Orion PDR is currently scheduled for April 2008. The costs of PDR will in-
clude all expenses prior to this date—approximately $5.5 billion. In a major develop-
ment  program,  approximately  15  percent  of  programmatic  dollars  would  be  con-
sumed  by  PDR.  A  successful  PDR  will  require  completed  design  specifications,  the
identification and acquisition of long-lead items, manufacturing plans, and firm life
cycle  cost  estimates,  a  methodical  process  that  effectively  brings  the  design  to  30
percent  completion.  The  PDR  will  provide  the  basis  for  determining  whether  the
baseline  design  is  acceptable  and  if  the  process  leading  to  Critical  Design  Review
may proceed.

port, she stated that as part of the CEV contract competition that was just com-

pleted: ‘‘NASA will receive firm competitive prices from industry to complete de-
velopment of the CEV. . .NASA will also establish not-to-exceed prices for pro-
duction of required CEVs to support the current flight manifest through 2019.’’
Q1a. Given  NASA’s  stated  confidence  in  having  firm  pricing  data,  is  NASA  willing
to  accept  a  formal  cost  cap  on  the  CEV  program?  If  so,  at  what  level  would
NASA propose the cost cap be set?

Q1b. If  not  now,  at  what  point  in  the  CEV  development  program  would  NASA  be

willing to accept a formal cost cap?

A1a, 1b. Historically, cost caps have not proven effective in managing major NASA
research  and  development  (R&D)  programs.  Constraining  the  International  Space
Station (ISS) to $2.1 billion annually did little to control overall program costs. And
while life cycle cost caps are regularly imposed on small, discrete projects (e.g., Ex-
plorer,  Discovery)  as  part  of  the  selection  process,  they  are  not  easily  adapted  to
major  R&D  efforts  that  extend  far  beyond  the  current  budget  horizon.  In  the  case
of  large  development  programs  such  as  Constellation,  cost  caps  can  be  problematic
as  they  depend  on  assumptions  regarding  outyear  funding.  The  future  priorities  of
the  country  are  not  known  and  can  change  over  the  life  of  the  Constellation  pro-
gram.

At  its  early  formulation  stage,  the  Constellation  Program  is  certain  to  face  ‘‘un-
known  unknowns’’  as  we  continue  to  refine  requirements,  develop  advanced  tech-
nologies,  and  begin  to  integrate  the  various  systems  into  an  operational  infrastruc-
ture  to  enable  long-term  exploration  of  the  Moon  and  Mars.  When  Constellation
moves  into  the  implementation  phase,  after  Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR)  in
the spring of 2008, design, cost, and schedule baselines will be established, and Pro-
gram  performance  will  be  measured  against  metrics  established  at  the  various  key
decision points throughout the life of the program. At this juncture, NASA will sub-
mit Constellation project life cycle cost commitments to Congress. Under Section 103
of the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109–155), NASA is required to submit
Major  Program  Annual  Reports,  the  first  of  which  shall  include  a  Baseline  Report
that is to include an estimate of the life cycle cost for those programs. Under Section
103, NASA is required to report changes to the Baseline Report—including life cycle
cost  estimates—as  part  of  the  annual  budget  request.  NASA  will  notify  the  Com-
mittee  at  other  junctures,  as  necessary,  if  there  are  any  adjustments  to  life  cycle
cost estimates. As such, NASA would advise against imposition of a formal statutory
‘‘cost cap’’ on CEV development.
Q2a. In  your  testimony,  you  stated  that  you  have  only  three  things  you  can  vary  in
the  CEV  program:  cost,  schedule,  and  performance.  If  there  is  cost  growth  in
the  CEV  program,  what  specifically  will  be  your  approach  to  dealing  with  it?
What  changes  in  performance  or  program  content  would  be  feasible  to  make
in order to contain cost growth?

A2a. NASA  is  committed  to  the  ‘‘go-as-you-can-afford-to-pay’’  approach.  In  this  ap-
proach,  the  implementation  of  capabilities  can  be  delayed  until  the  budget  is  avail-
able.  For  example,  the  Orion  CEV  is  being  designed  as  a  vehicle  for  the  lunar  mis-
sion,  and  development  of  some  capabilities  for  that  mission  can  be  delayed  until
needed.  For  example,  the  Guidance,  Navigation,  and  Control  GN&C  software  re-
quired  to  get  to  lunar  orbit  and  return  is  not  necessary  for  the  CEV’s  early  flights.
Q2b. Is there a date beyond which you would not slip the CEV schedule? If so, what

is it?

A2b. The  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155)  endorses  the  President’s
Vision for Space Exploration, which charged NASA to conduct the first manned mis-
sion no later than 2014.
Q2c. Is  it  possible  to  slip  CEV  schedule  without  increasing  the  life  cycle  cost  of  the

CEV program? If so, how?

A2c. Experience has shown that, if the completion of elements of major development
programs  is  delayed  significantly,  the  overall  cost  of  a  major  development  program
will go up.
Q3a. The GAO has pointed out that with respect to your budget plan, ‘‘. . .there are
years when NASA does not have sufficient funding to implement the architec-
ture. Some yearly shortfalls exceed $1 billion, while in other years the funding
available  exceeds  needed  resources.’’  In  fact,  NASA  is  proposing  to  ‘‘bank’’
funds in its CEV and CLV account in FY 2006 and FY 2007 in excess of what
it  could  spend  in  those  years,  with  the  intent  of  trying  to  make  those  funds

available  in  later  years  when  its  planned  funding  is  insufficient  to  meet  the
program’s needs.
Why,  only  two  years  into  the  President’s  multi-decade  Vision  for  Space  Explo-
ration  (VSE),  is  NASA  having  to  resort  to  such  budgetary  maneuvers  to  fund
its implementation of the Exploration initiative?

A3a. The President called for an affordable and sustainable program of exploration.
Reflecting  that  direction,  our  budget  profile  is  relatively  level,  though  the  natural
funding  curve  for  a  major  development  program,  such  as  Constellation,  is  not  flat.
When  NASA  retires  the  Space  Shuttle,  additional  funds  will  become  available  for
Constellation, but that will not occur until 2010. Long-lead procurements and early
design  effort  will  ramp  up  prior  to  2010.  Therefore,  as  NASA  has  outlined  for  the
Committee  in  correspondence  and  testimony,  funding  carryover  for  Constellation
will allow us to meet those requirements in FY 2008 and FY 2009.
Q3b. Why  shouldn’t  Congress  insist  that  NASA  only  submit  requests  for  funding
that  are  consistent  with  the  actual  Exploration  program  funding  needs  in  a
given  fiscal  year—especially  given  the  competing  demands  for  funds  in  other
parts  of  NASA?  Wouldn’t  such  an  approach  be  more  aligned  to  the  way  devel-
opment programs historically have been funded?

A3b. One of the ways the ups and downs of development funding curves can be ac-
commodated  is  by  optimizing  the  use  of  two-year  R&D  funding,  and  phasing  the
program schedule to align with available funding.
Q4. Why  was  it  necessary  to  shift  almost  $7  billion  into  the  Constellation  program
[which includes the CEV and CLV] for the years FY 2006 to FY 2010 compared
to  what  NASA  had  said  would  be  needed  over  that  period  in  last  year’s  budget
request?

Q4a. Did NASA underestimate the cost of the CEV and CLV programs?
Q4b. NASA has indicated that it will not be possible to launch an operational CEV
until  2014—which  was  the  original  goal—despite  the  additional  funds  that
have been transferred into the program to ‘‘accelerate’’ it. Why is that?

A4a, 4b. NASA did not underestimate the life cycle costs. Funding for Constellation
Systems has been increased from the FY 2006 President’s Budget within overall Ex-
ploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  funding.  This  budget  increase  reflects  the
Agency’s position, based on the results of the ESAS, the President’s continuing com-
mitment  to  the  priorities  identified  in  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  and  the
NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155).  Increased  funds  are  specifically
identified  for  the  Orion  CEV  and  Ares  I  CLV  in  order  to  ensure  their  ability  to
launch humans no later than 2014, but as close to 2010 as possible.

Increased  funding  for  the  CEV  supported  a  better  defined,  lower-risk  program
with an earlier down-select to a single contractor for CEV design; a Preliminary De-
sign  Review  in  FY  2008;  Critical  Design  Review  in  FY  2009;  potential  design
verification  tests  in  2007  (to  be  determined  after  selection  of  a  prime  contractor);
and  initial  tests  of  a  Launch  Abort  System  starting  in  FY  2009  (or  sooner,  depend-
ing on available funding).

Increased  funding  for  the  Ares  I  CLV  supports  early  design  work  with  Space
Shuttle  contractors  to  prepare  the  solid  rocket  boosters  for  use  as  the  first  stage  of
the Ares I CLV; development of a propulsion system for the upper stage of the Ares
I CLV; and early design work to modify the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) for
use  as  an  expendable  engine  on  the  future  Ares  V  Cargo  Launch  Vehicle  (CaLV).
A plan was put in place early in 2006 to effectively accelerate development activi-
ties  by  refocusing  on  developing  Ares  I  hardware  with  greater  extensibility  to  the
Ares V system. Consistent with this new strategy, NASA made several launch vehi-
cle architectural design adjustments such as changing the four-segment RSRM first
stage  to  a  five-segment  RSRM  first  stage,  and  replacing  the  SSME  upper  stage  en-
gine  with  the  J–2S-derived  J–2X  engine.  These  architectural  changes  reduced  the
number  of  distinct  development  cycles  by  capitalizing  on  design  synergies  between
the  Ares  I  and  the  Ares  V:  single  upper  stage  development  (J–2X)  and  increased
first  stage  commonality  between  Ares  I  and  Ares  V.  This  will,  in  turn,  reduce  life
cycle costs and major risks.

Funding  is  also  necessary  to  support  initial  design  efforts  to  modify,  or  in  some
cases start from new, necessary ground systems to support the operational require-
ments of the Ares I and Ares V. This includes potential changes to the launch infra-
structure  at  Kennedy  Space  Center,  as  well  as  NASA’s  ground-based  and  in-space
communications infrastructure for space exploration missions.

Question submitted by Representative Ralph M. Hall
Q1. What  is  the  cost  estimate  for  the  major  components  of  Orion:  the  Launch  Abort

System, Crew Module, Service Module, and inter-stage?

A1. NASA does not currently track Orion CEV costs in a way that allows the deter-
mination  of  the  cost  of  the  Launch  Abort  System  and  other  components.  NASA  is
currently  working  with  the  Orion  Prime  Contractor  on  a  contract  modification  that
will, among other things, modify the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to allow col-
lection  of  costs  by  Service  Module,  Crew  Module  and  Launch  Abort  System.  This
work  will  be  complete  in  the  early  spring  2007  to  support  the  activities  for  the  FY
2009 budget cycle.

Question submitted by Representative Dana Rohrabacher
Q1. Please provide NASA’s estimate for the total cost of the Orion and Ares I devel-

opment programs through the test flights of Orion.

A1. Launch  vehicle  costs  for  the  Ares  I  Crew  Launch  Vehicle  through  the  first
human launch, currently projected late in FY 2014, are approximately $10.8 billion.
This  number  excludes  the  Orion  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle,  mission  and  ground  op-
erations and facility modifications, and program integration and other program-level
costs.  Orion  Crew  Exploration  Vehicle  project  costs  through  first  human  flight  are
about $10.3 billion. Therefore, combined Ares I and Orion project costs through first
human  launch  are  about  $21.1  billion.  If  related  required  programmatic  and  non-
flight  hardware  costs  are  included  in  the  estimate,  it  will  cost  about  $33.5  billion
to get to the point of first human launch projected in 2014.

All  of  these  numbers  include  reserves,  but  exclude  Corporate  G&A.  These  num-
bers  include  estimates  for  FYs  2012,  2013,  and  2014,  which  lie  beyond  the  budget
horizon.

Questions submitted by Representative Jo Bonner
Q1. Recent Shuttle missions have shown the importance of having a robotic arm and
cameras to properly inspect the Shuttle. Do you feel a robotic arm might be bene-
ficial when inspecting the CEV, either when it’s not attached to the International
Space  Station,  in  a  another  orbit,  or  on  a  separate  mission?  Do  you  believe  a
robotic arm would be beneficial for future space missions?

A1. The  Orion  vehicle  is  designed  to  be  inherently  safer  than  the  Shuttle  in  that
the heat shield used to protect the capsule during re-entry is protected from launch
and  on-orbit  debris  by  Service  Module  for  most  of  the  mission.  Just  prior  to  the
Crew Module return to Earth, the Service Module is jettisoned and this exposes the
heat  shield.  The  heat  shield  is  designed  to  be  replaced  after  each  mission.  Based
on  this  improved  overall  technical  concept  of  operation,  the  Orion  does  not  include
a robotic arm.
Q2. Is  there  a  robotic  arm  currently  being  considered  on  the  CEV,  and  if  so,  is  it

included in the draft drawings of the CEV?

A2. The current Orion design concept does not include a robotic arm.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. Why did NASA decide to fundamentally change its acquisition approach for the
CEV after pursuing a ‘‘spiral development’’ approach for the first one and a half
years  of  the  Exploration  initiative?  What  was  wrong  with  the  original  acquisi-
tion approach?

A1. NASA changed its acquisition approach from the previous ‘‘spiral development’’
approach  to  reduce  technical,  cost,  and  schedule  risk.  Spiral  development  is  a  proc-
ess to achieve a desired capability where the end-state requirements are not known
at program initiation. Spiral development was based on an undefined transportation
architecture.  Subsequent  comprehensive  requirements  definition  and  independent
assessments  defined  an  architecture  and  showed  that  a  continued  spiral  approach
would  no  longer  fit,  as  it  would  increase  cost,  schedule,  and  technical  risk.  NASA
made  a  decision  to  spend  its  resources  in  developing  its  exploration  transportation
end-state  requirements  and  architecture  for  Exploration  through  a  number  of  par-
allel efforts for the formulation phase of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV)
project.  The  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155)  also  directed  NASA  to

pursue a Shuttle-derived transportation system to support a sustained human pres-
ence on the Moon and ability to support future destinations. This approach was also
the one chosen through doing trade studies.

In  May  2005,  the  Exploration  Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS)  was  initiated
with  one  of  its  tasks  to  provide  a  complete  assessment  of  the  top-level  Orion  CEV
requirements. As a result of ESAS, the architecture and the top level requirements
for the Orion CEV were chosen, and made part of the Phase 2 competition. At that
point,  NASA  saw  no  benefit  of  keeping  two  prime  contractors  through  Preliminary
Design  Review  (PDR)  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $1  billion  each  (as  in  a  spiral  ap-
proach).  Rather,  NASA  saw  a  better  return  of  its  investment  in  competitively
issuing  two  Phase  1  Orion  CEV  Prime  Contracts  for  conceptual  design  and  trade
studies against the ESAS architecture for an estimated cost of $46 million each.

Additionally,  NASA  established  an  intra-agency  Orion  CEV  Smart  Buyer  team
which performed trade studies and design analysis that was used by the Orion CEV
Project  Office  to  understand  and  verify  the  appropriateness  of  the  requirements  in-
corporated  into  the  Orion  CEV  Phase  2  solicitation  and  evaluation  of  proposals.
With  knowledge  gained  from  ESAS,  the  Smart  Buyer  team,  and  Orion  CEV  Phase
1  contracts,  NASA  was  in  a  position  to  ‘‘down  select’’  to  a  single  Prime  contractor
and  initiate  the  Design,  Development,  and  Test  and  Evaluation  (DDT&E)  contract
for  the  Orion  CEV  in  order  to  baseline  an  industry  approach  and  commitment  to
meet the desired outcomes of the Orion CEV project. This new acquisition approach
provides  NASA  with  the  capability  to  shorten  the  gap  in  human  space  flight  capa-
bility with the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2010. The original ‘‘spiral develop-
ment’’  acquisition  approach  contained  significant  risk  that  this  nation  would  not
have  a  human  space  flight  capability  by  2014  with  a  higher  development  cost  of
close to $1 billion.
Q2. In  order  to  make  your  proposed  CEV  and  CLV  acquisition  approaches  work,
NASA has had to shift significant amounts of funding from the exploration tech-
nology  R&D  and  Space  Station  research  accounts.  Do  you  intend  to  restore  all
of  the  funding  that  was  cut  from  those  accounts?  If  so,  when  will  that  occur?
A2. Last year, the content of the ESMD Research and Technology Development pro-
gram  was  prioritized,  (Human  Systems  Research  and  Technology  (HSRT)  and  Ex-
ploration  Systems  Research  and  Technology  (ESRT) ),  as  part  of  the  Exploration
Systems  Architecture  Study  (ESAS)  review,  to  ensure  that  the  R&T  portfolio  di-
rectly supports requirements of the Constellation Systems program. The Exploration
Technology  Development  content  was  substantially  reduced 
this
prioritization activity and retains only the high priority research and technology de-
velopment  projects  that  support  exploration  needs.  Future  research  and  technology
development  will  be  phased  so  that  technologies  are  ready  when  they  are  needed
to meet the Constellation program development schedules.

Additionally,  NASA  is  conducting  research  and  developing  new  technologies  for
lunar  and  Mars  exploration  that  will  reduce  mission  risk,  reduce  logistics  require-
ments,  and  reduce  mission  life  cycle  cost.  In-situ  resource  utilization  and  non-toxic
power  and  propulsion  systems  are  examples  of  these  kinds  of  technologies.  These
investments  also  have  important  connections  to  U.S.  scientific,  economic,  and  na-
tional security interests.
Q3. If  Congress  followed  GAO’s  recommendation  to  restrict  annual  appropriations
and  limit  obligations  for  the  CEV  project  ‘‘to  only  the  amount  of  funding  nec-
essary  to  support  activities  needed  to  successfully  complete  the  project’s  pre-
liminary design review,’’

through 

Q3a. What  impact  would  that  have  on  NASA’s  schedule  for  developing  and  deploy-
ing  the  CEV,  including  the  impact  on  procurement  of  long-lead  items?  What
is your estimate based on?

Q3b. What impact would that have on NASA’s cost to develop and deploy the CEV?

What is your estimate based on?

A3a, 3b. The impact of restricting appropriations for CEV to only support PDR, cur-
rently  scheduled  for  April  2008,  would  be  very  negative.  The  Orion  CEV  benefits
from a competitive down select process in which NASA received an innovative cost,
technical, and management approach from Lockheed Martin. This effort relies upon
continuity  within  the  Development  and  Test  phase  of  the  Orion  CEV  contract.  The
PDR  is  a  part  of  the  engineering  development  process  and  not  an  end  item  for  the
development of the Orion CEV.

The  line  between  preliminary  design  and  detailed  design  is  a  blurry  one.  PDR  is
a  somewhat  arbitrary  construct  that  permits  the  customer  to  make  a  detailed  as-
sessment  of  progress  to  date,  set  at  the  time  when  most  of  the  preliminary  design

is complete. Some will have been completed long ago, and, typically, some items will
not be complete at PDR. DDT&E for differing phases of development is not set forth
in  a  serial,  end-to-beginning  fashion.  Rather,  an  efficient  plan  has  different  phases
beginning  and  ending  at  different  times  for  different  components  and  subsystems.
Using the PDR as a hard break in the activities of the prime contractor would pre-
vent  Orion  CEV  from  being  developed  as  efficiently  as  possible,  and  would  affect
cost and schedule accordingly.

The  delay  in  execution  of  a  comprehensive  development  plan  by  industry  would
also cause a delay in the completion of that plan. This would add time to the sched-
ule,  and  experience  shows  that  extending  the  development  schedule  is  one  of  the
primary  causes  of  increased  costs  to  a  development  program.  The  ideal  situation  is
to  allow  a  contractor  to  make  an  efficient  and  effective  plan  through  completion  of
development, and to reduce perturbations to that plan to an absolute minimum.

In  addition,  division  of  DDT&E  into  two  contracts,  with  the  second  contract
awarded after PDR, would mandate that the second contract be a sole-source nego-
tiation.  The  alternative  to  this  is  to  change  prime  contractors,  resulting  in  signifi-
cant  delay  and  rework.  Under  this  scenario,  negotiations  regarding  the  largest  ex-
pense  of  the  development  effort,  the  final  hardware  design  and  fabrication,  would
occur  without  the  benefit  of  competition.  Based  on  long,  historical  experience  with
large multi-year contracts, NASA is convinced that this approach would create great
cost and/or schedule risk.

Given  the  knowledge  NASA  has  with  regard  to  its  end-state  requirements,  the
most  effective  end-item  to  procure  at  this  point  is  a  fully  funded  DDT&E  effort.
There is no benefit for the Government to limit the funding and the contract to PDR
of the development phase of the Orion CEV project.
Q4. What  are  the  major  challenges  facing  NASA  as  it  moves  to  implement  its  Con-
stellation  program  [which  includes  both  the  CEV  and  its  Crew  Launch  Vehicle
(CLV) ]?

A4. From  a  technical  perspective,  the  Ares  I  CLV  has  three  top  technical  risks:
launch  vehicle  operability;  ability  to  meet  Ares  I  performance  requirements;  and,
the J–2X development schedule. The Constellation Program is carrying two risks for
Orion,  the  risk  of  mass  growth  and  the  Launch  Abort  System  development.  NASA
does have risk mitigation activities and plans in place.
Q5. When  NASA  announced  its  Exploration  architecture  last  fall,  the  Crew  Launch
Vehicle  (CLV)  was  supposed  to  make  use  of  flight-proven  Space  Shuttle  compo-
nents.  To  what  extent  is  that  still  the  case,  and  for  those  cases  where  Shuttle
hardware will no longer be used or will be significantly modified, how will CLV
costs and programmatic risk be affected? On what is your assessment based?

A5. Ares  incorporates  Space  Shuttle  components  in  addition  to  utilizing  the  infra-
structure  and  workforce  associated  with  the  Space  Shuttle.  The  human-rated  Ares
I that will deliver the CEV to low-Earth orbit (LEO) early next decade is an in-line
configuration with a five-segment first stage Reusable Solid Rocket Booster (RSRB)
based on the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB).

The  heavy-lift  Cargo  Launch  Vehicle  (CaLV)  also  builds  on  heritage  hardware
from  the  Apollo  and  Space  Shuttle  vehicles,  with  a  propulsion  core  consisting  of  a
33-foot  diameter  core  tank  with  five  expendable  RS–68  engines  and  two  modified
Ares I First Stage RSRBs.

Hardware  commonality  between  the  Ares  I  CLV  and  Ares  V  CaLV,  such  as  the
RSRB and the J–2X engine, will reduce the logistics footprint, as well as non-recur-
ring and fixed operations costs, which will help sustain long-term space exploration,
expanding  humanity’s  reach  to  the  Moon,  Mars,  and  beyond.  Where  we  are  not
using Shuttle hardware, we are using heritage J–2 engines used by the Apollo Sat-
urn vehicles and for X–33 testing. We believe by using heritage hardware and hav-
ing an active risk mitigation plan and approach will reduce life cycle costs and risks.
NASA  has  spent  the  past  year  continuing  to  refine  and  mitigate  concept  risks
through the combination of trades and analysis performed by NASA in-house teams.
As  a  result  of  ESAS  and  the  ensuing  work,  the  architecture  and  the  top-level  re-
quirements for the Ares I were established. The Constellation Program systems en-
gineering  and  integration  process  has  been  established  to  control  changes  to  mis-
sions,  requirements,  cost,  schedule  and  risk  as  these  occur  normally  through  the
project formulation and development processes. Monthly Ares I reviews of technical
content,  cost,  schedule,  and  principle  risk  factors  are  performed  to  integrate  and
control  the  risks  from  each  element  and  determine  if  these  risks  and  mitigation
strategies should be elevated to the top Ares I project risk list and coordinated with
the Constellation Program office.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. Does  NASA  have  the  financial  resources  necessary  to  complete  the  acquisition

strategy that it has adopted for the CEV?

A1. At  this  time  based  on  what  we  know—yes.  In  its  early  formulation  stage,  the
Constellation Program is certain to face ‘‘unknown unknowns’’ as we continue to re-
fine requirements, develop advanced technologies, and begin to integrate the various
systems  into  an  operational  infrastructure  to  enable  long-term  exploration  of  the
Moon  and  Mars.  When  Constellation  moves  into  the  implementation  phase,  after
Preliminary  Design  Review  in  the  spring  of  2008,  design,  cost,  and  schedule  base-
lines  will  be  established,  and  program  performance  will  be  measured  against
metrics established at the various key decision points throughout the life of the mis-
sion.  At  this  point  NASA  will  declare  Constellation  project  Life  Cycle  Cost  commit-
ments to Congress.

We  are  making  every  effort  to  avoid  cost  growth  and  schedule  slip,  through  ag-
gressive use of management tools at all phases of the Program: defining and control-
ling  requirements,  generating  realistic  cost  estimates  early  on  (ESAS),  employing  a
‘‘smart  buyer’’  approach  to  major  acquisitions,  and  monitoring  performance  by
means of a rigorous earned value management system. Thus far, we have been suc-
cessful in achieving critical milestones within our budget profile.
Q1a. What particular aspects of the acquisition activity have the potential for signifi-

cant cost growth?

A1a. The  Constellation  Program  is  carrying  two  risks  for  the  CEV.  The  first  is  a
risk  common  to  most  development  programs  and  that  is  the  risk  that  the  mass  of
the system will outgrow its control mass. The other risk carried for CEV is the chal-
lenging schedule to develop and test the Launch Abort System. As with any complex
system, risks are present and trades option analysis/studies are performed to deter-
mine  the  best  approach  to  mitigate  these  risks.  The  study  results  will  provide  the
best mitigation strategy to buy down each risk.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Allen Li, Director, Acquisition and Sourcing Management, Government

Accountability Office

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. NASA’s  notification  to  Congress  on  its  intent  to  begin  development  of  Orion
states  that  NASA  has  identified  no  ‘‘areas  in  the  CEV  concept  where  the  tech-
nology  is  immature.’’  What  is  your  view  on  NASA’s  assertions  that  risks  on  the
Orion  project  are  minimal  due  to  the  use  of  heritage  hardware  and  low  tech-
nology risk? What specific risks are you concerned about?

A1. While  the  assumption  that  the  risks  on  the  Orion  project  are  minimal  due  to
the  use  of  heritage  hardware  and  low  risk  technology  seems  logical  on  the  surface,
in  practice,  this  has  not  always  shown  to  be  the  case.  GAO’s  work  has  shown  that
other space programs that have made similar optimistic assumptions about savings
from the use of heritage hardware and the availability of mature technology, for ex-
ample,  have  suffered  unexpected  cost  increases  and  schedule  delays.  For  instance,
the  Geostationary  Operation  Environmental  Satellite  I–M  (GOES  I–M)  has  experi-
enced severe technical challenges, massive cost overruns, and risky schedule delays,
despite  optimistic  assumptions  including  savings  from  heritage  systems  and  readi-
ness  of  technology  maturity.  GAO  reported  that  these  problems  were  caused  by  a
number  of  factors  including  insufficient  technical  readiness  of  the  satellite  design
prior to contract award and unrealistic cost and schedule estimates. In addition, we
also  found  in  reviewing  the  Advanced  Extremely  High  Frequency  Satellite  System
that  optimistic  or  aggressive  schedules,  resulting  from  the  pressure  to  minimize  a
gap  between  the  existing  and  new  program  and  unanticipated  technical  complex-
ities, not only increased the schedule gap, but also led to cost increases.
Q2. The GAO has recommended that NASA refrain from any development activities
beyond  the  Preliminary  Design  Review.  To  what  extent  has  the  Agency  started
such work?

A2. GAO  does  not  have  information  on  development  activities  beyond  those  nec-
essary  to  complete  a  successful  preliminary  design  review  that  NASA  may  have
begun  at  this  point.  NASA  is  in  a  better  position  to  provide  information  to  respond
to  this  question.  However,  regardless  of  whether  such  activities  have  begun,  GAO’s
concern  is  that  the  contract  as  it  is  structured  gives  NASA  and  the  contractor  the
ability to begin such work prior to the preliminary design review. Undertaking this
work, prior to demonstrating the appropriate levels of knowledge at the preliminary
design  review  can  result  in  extensive  redesign  because  of  the  high  number  of  un-
knowns on the project—technologies that have yet to be matured, requirements that
have  yet  to  be  fully  defined,  a  preliminary  design  that  has  yet  to  be  approved,  and
a firm estimate of cost that has yet to be established.
Q3. Does  the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  have  the  financial  resources
necessary  to  complete  the  adopted  acquisition  strategy  for  Orion  and  Ares  I  by
2014?

A3. According to NASA, the fiscal year 2007 budget contained no serious unresolved
budget issues for the CEV or the Constellation program. In addition, NASA has in-
dicated  that  the  fiscal  year  2008  budget  request  will  also  contain  no  serious  unre-
solved  budget  issues.  However,  NASA  made  several  changes  to  the  exploration  ar-
chitecture since the release of the fiscal year 2007 budget that will be accounted for
in  the  fiscal  year  2008  budget.  As  we  reported,  according  to  NASA  officials  some
of  these  changes  would  increase  near-term  costs,  but  benefit  overall  life  cycle  costs
of  the  program.  NASA  would  not  provide  GAO  with  the  cost  data  to  support  its
claim  about  the  impact  of  the  changes  to  the  architecture;  therefore,  based  upon
available information, we cannot verify that the Exploration Systems Mission Direc-
torate  has  the  financial  resources  necessary  to  complete  the  adopted  acquisition
strategy for Orion and Ares I by 2014.
Q4. How does the Orion Acquisition strategy compare with that of the Ares I? Given
that the Ares I is also in the very early stages of development, can NASA be con-
fident  that  the  rocket  will  perform  well  enough  to  support  the  current  design  of
Orion?

A4. GAO  is  currently  reviewing  the  acquisition  strategy  of  the  Ares  I  project.  Our
preliminary work indicates similar tendencies as found with the CEV in that NASA
plans to execute at least two long-term contracts before the development of a sound

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

business case for the project. In 2006, NASA initiated contract actions that will lead
to a sole-source contract later this year (tentatively planned for December 2006) for
development  of  the  first  stage  of  the  CLV.  This  first  stage  will  use  heritage  hard-
ware  from  the  Shuttle  program,  namely  an  evolved  five-segment  Reusable  Solid
Rocket Booster. The acquisition strategy for the Upper Stage is a bit more involved.
The  agency  plans  to  award  a  sole  source  contract  for  development  of  a  derivative
of  the  Saturn  era  J–2  engine  toward  the  end  of  2006.  While  this  engine  is  based
on legacy hardware, the development effort appears to be similar to a ‘‘clean sheet’’
design of the engine using modern manufacturing processes and redesigned internal
components. The agency also plans to release draft requests for proposals in Decem-
ber  2006  leading  to  a  competitively  awarded  contract  for  development  of  the  main
elements  for  the  Upper  Stage  in  August  2007.  Preliminary  briefings  presented  to
GAO  on  Ares  I  acquisition  strategy  hold  promise  that  the  project  will  be  following
a knowledge-base acquisition approach. According to information provided by NASA,
the  Ares  I  acquisition  strategy  calls  for  the  inclusion  of  key  decision  points  (KDPs)
to be held at each phase in the project life cycle. These KDPs appear to roughly cor-
respond to GAO’s knowledge points, but we have not been provided enough informa-
tion  to  perform  a  comprehensive  analysis.  Our  concern  focuses  on  the  effectiveness
of these proposed key decision points for the Ares I project since they will occur well
after  the  awarding  of  long-term  developmental  contracts,  similar  to  what  we  re-
ported  with  the  CEV  acquisition.  GAO  will  provide  updates  to  the  Committee  as
this  work  progresses.  NASA  is  in  a  better  position  to  respond  to  the  question  of
whether it is confident that the Ares I will perform well enough to support the cur-
rent Orion design.

Ouestions submitted by Representative Bart Gordon
Q1. How does NASA’s current acquisition strategy for the CEV compare with its ini-
tial  approach?  Was  the  budget  plan  for  the  initial  approach  realistic  or  did  it
have  similar  mismatch  between  available  funding  and  resource  needs  in  given
years?

A1. NASA’s  former  acquisition  strategy  involved  selecting  two  contractors  to  de-
velop  concepts  for  the  CEV.  Once  these  concepts  were  sufficiently  designed,  NASA
planned  to  down  select  to  one  contractor  for  the  remainder  of  the  program.  The
timeframe for this down select was after the preliminary design review. In addition,
NASA  planned  to  use  spiral  development—a  type  of  evolutionary  development—for
the  program.  Evolutionary  development  is  an  approach  that  enables  organizations
to  achieve  a  match  between  needs  and  resources.  Under  this  approach,  basic  re-
quirements  are  achieved  first,  with  additional  capabilities  planned  for  future  gen-
erations  of  the  product.  Because  product  development  is  incremental,  achieving
knowledge is more manageable. This type of approach is especially worthwhile if the
goal is to reduce development cycle times and get the system operational as quickly
as  possible.  Our  work  has  shown  that  evolutionary  development  is  a  best  practice
for system development that can help reduce risks at critical junctures and help en-
sure  that  decision  makers  get  the  most  out  of  their  investments.  In  2005,  NASA
changed  course  and  chose  a  different  approach  for  the  program.  This  approach  en-
tailed  selecting  and  awarding  a  contract  to  one  contractor  over  a  year  and  a  half
before the preliminary design review. The result of NASA’s chosen approach is that
the  Agency  is  committed  to  one  concept,  thereby  removing  their  ability  to  leverage
the  most  beneficial  aspects  of  each  design.  NASA’s  administrator  has  testified  that
the  earlier  plans  for  the  CEV,  which  called  for  operational  deployment  of  the  CEV
not  later  than  2014,  were  abandoned  in  an  effort  to  accelerate  the  development  of
the CEV and have it operational as soon as possible. NASA’s planning for its explo-
ration architecture was based on a 2011 operational capability of the CEV. However,
NASA’s approach has not resulted in a significant decrease in development time and
current  program  documents  continue  to  show  an  operational  date  for  the  CEV  of
2014. GAO is unaware of NASA developing a similar cost estimate for its initial ap-
proach to the CEV project. However, given that that project was so early in the con-
cept development stage when it was abandoned, it is unlikely that NASA had suffi-
cient information to develop such an estimate. Therefore, we cannot project whether
the  budget  plan  for  the  initial  approach  was  realistic  or  faced  a  similar  mismatch
between available funding and resource needs in given years.
Q2. To what degree, if at all, does NASA’s current approach deviate from ‘‘best prac-

tices’’ for large systems acquisitions?

A2. NASA  approach  deviates  from  best  practices  because  it  commits  the  govern-
ment  to  a  long-term  effort  prior  to  obtaining  the  knowledge  necessary  to  support

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

101

such a commitment. At the time of our July 2006 report, the contract was intended
to cover all design, development, test and evaluation, production, and sustaining en-
gineering  activities.  As  I  mentioned  in  my  statement,  NASA  modified  its  approach
and  made  the  production  and  sustainment  activities  contract  options.  This  step
brings NASA’s approach more in line with best practices, but the Agency is still tak-
ing a risky approach with the project by committing to activities beyond PDR with-
out  a  sound  business  case.  Without  such  knowledge  it  is  difficult  for  NASA  to  pre-
dict  with  any  confidence  how  much  the  project  will  cost,  what  technologies  will  or
will  not  be  available  to  meet  performance  expectations,  and  when  the  vehicle  will
be ready for use. In addition, NASA’s current acquisition policies do not support the
attainment of such knowledge at key junctures in the development process. If NASA
had in place controls to ensure that the progress of the CEV project would be meas-
ured  against  standardized  knowledge  base  criteria,  the  risks  associated  with  their
current  approach  would  be  lessened.  Briefings  that  we  have  seen  on  changes  to
NASA’s  program  and  project  management  policies  look  promising,  but  NASA  has
yet  to  issue  its  revised  policy  and  consequently,  we  have  yet  to  review  the  actual
document.
Q3. Has  GAO  recommended  a  similar  type  of  approach  on  other  acquisition  pro-
grams  to  what  it  is  recommending  for  NASA’s  CEV  program?  Has  the  govern-
ment  approached  any  past  acquisitions  with  a  similar  long-term,  life  cycle  cost
strategy? What were the results?

A3. Most major acquisition programs within the Department of Defense are encour-
aged  not  to  commit  the  government  to  production  and  sustainment  activities  prior
to  demonstrating  that  the  system  works  as  intended.  Our  prior  recommendations
have focused on the need to acquire knowledge at critical points in the development
process,  not  specifically  on  the  contract.  However,  we  have  recommended  that  pro-
grams delay the award of a contract due to a lack of adequate knowledge. The Joint
Strike  Fighter  (JSF)  is  one  notable  example.  The  JSF  program  did  not  concur  with
our recommendation and awarded its contract without first gaining sufficient knowl-
edge. Subsequently, the program has experienced over a 30 percent cost growth and
almost  a  year  delay  in  schedule.  At  issue  with  the  CEV  project  is  that  NASA  has
no certainty what the status of the project will be at the PDR, in terms of cost esti-
mates or technology maturity for example, but will be committed to proceed regard-
less or will be forced to terminate the contract and incur additional costs.
Q4. What types of indicators should Congress ask NASA to provide in order to gauge
the process of CEV development and ensure adequate oversight at key junctures
during  its  development,  including  at  the  preliminary  design  review,  the  critical
design review, and at the production review?

A4. Successful  product  developers  ensure  a  high  level  of  knowledge  was  achieved
at  key  junctures  in  development,  including  the  preliminary  design  review,  the  crit-
ical  design  review,  and  the  production  review.  These  junctures  and  associated  indi-
cators are defined as follows:

Preliminary Design Review: Resources and needs match. This level of knowl-
edge  occurs  when  a  sound  business  case  is  made  for  the  product—that  is,  a
match  is  made  between  the  customer’s  requirements  and  the  product  devel-
oper’s  available  resources  in  terms  of  knowledge,  time,  money,  and  capacity.
Achieving  a  high  level  of  technology  maturity  at  the  start  of  system  develop-
ment  is  an  important  indicator  of  whether  this  match  has  been  made.  This
means  that  the  technologies  needed  to  meet  essential  product  requirements
have  been  demonstrated  to  work  in  their  intended  environment.  The  Congress
could  ask  NASA  to  provide  information  on  the  following  indicators  to  verify
that:

(Technology Readiness Level 6 or 7);

• all technologies are demonstrated to a high level of technology maturity—
• project requirements are informed by the systems engineering process;
• cost  and  schedule  estimates  established  for  the  project  are  based  on
knowledge  from  the  preliminary  design  using  systems  engineering  tools;
• additional resources are in place including needed workforce; and
• a decision review is conducted following completion of the preliminary de-

sign review.

Critical Design Review: Product design is stable. This level of knowledge oc-
curs  when  a  program  determines  that  a  product’s  design  is  stable—that  is,  it
will meet customer requirements and cost and schedule targets. A best practice

is  to  achieve  design  stability  at  the  system-level  critical  design  review,  usually
held  midway  through  development.  Completion  of  at  least  90  percent  of  engi-
neering  drawings  at  the  system  design  review  provides  tangible  evidence  that
the  design  is  stable.  The  Congress  could  ask  NASA  to  provide  information  on
the following indicators at the critical design review to verify that:

obtained;

tion, or prototypes;

• at least 90 percent of engineering drawings are complete;
• all subsystem and system design reviews are completed;
• the  design  meets  requirements  demonstrated  through  modeling,  simula-
• stakeholders  concurrence  that  drawings  are  complete  and  producible  is
• failure modes and effects analysis are completed;
• key system characteristics are identified;
• critical manufacturing processes are identified;
• reliability  targets  are  established  and  a  growth  plan  based  on  dem-
onstrated  reliability  rates  of  components  and  subsystems  is  developed;
and
• a decision review is conducted following the completion of the Critical De-

sign Review.

Production Review: Production processes are mature. This level of knowledge
is  achieved  when  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  product  can  be  manufac-
tured  within  cost,  schedule,  and  quality  targets.  A  best  practice  is  to  ensure
that all key manufacturing processes are in statistical control—that is, they are
repeatable,  sustainable,  and  capable  of  consistently  producing  parts  within  the
product’s quality tolerances and standards—at the start of production. The Con-
gress could ask NASA to provide information on the following indicators at the
production review to verify that:

reliability goals;

• manufacturing processes have been demonstrated;
• production representative prototypes have been built;
• production representative prototypes have been tested and have achieved
• production  representative  prototypes  have  been  demonstrated  product  in
• statistical process control data has been collected;
• critical processes have been demonstrated to be capable and that they are

Q5. Do  you  agree  or  disagree  with  NASA’s  view  that  risks  on  the  CEV  project  are
minimal  due  to  the  use  of  heritage  hardware  and  a  low  technology  risk  ap-
proach?

A5. While  the  assumption  that  the  risks  on  the  Orion  project  are  minimal  due  to
the  use  of  heritage  hardware  and  low  risk  technology  seems  logical  on  the  surface,
in  practice,  this  has  not  always  shown  to  be  the  case.  GAO’s  work  has  shown  that
other space programs that have made similar optimistic assumptions about savings
from the use of heritage hardware and the availability of mature technology, for ex-
ample,  have  suffered  unexpected  cost  increases  and  schedule  delays.  For  instance,
the  Geostationary  Operation  Environmental  Satellite  I–M  (GOES  I–M)  has  experi-
ences severe technical challenges, massive cost overruns, and risky schedule delays,
despite  optimistic  assumptions  including  savings  from  heritage  systems  and  readi-
ness  of  technology  maturity.  GAO  reported  that  these  problems  were  cause  by  a
number  of  factors  including  insufficient  technical  readiness  of  the  satellite  design
prior to contract award and unrealistic cost and schedule estimates. In addition, we
also  found  in  reviewing  the  Advanced  Extremely  High  Frequency  Satellite  System
that  optimistic  schedules,  resulting  from  the  pressure  to  minimize  a  gap  between
the existing and new program and unanticipated technical complexities, not only in-
creased  the  schedule  gap,  but  also  led  to  cost  increases  and  possible  quality  issues.
Q6. Should  Congress  impose  a  formal  cost  cap  on  the  CEV  program?  If  so,  at  what
point  in  the  development  program  should  the  cap  be  imposed?  If  not,  why  not?
A6. While  instituting  a  cost  cap  on  the  CEV  project  could  help  to  encourage  fiscal
responsibility  for  the  project,  other  factors  need  to  be  considered  before  using  such

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

103

an  approach.  As  we  reported,  NASA  lacks  a  firm  estimate  of  project  cost  at  this
point and will not be able to produce such an estimate until the preliminary design
review scheduled for 2008. Therefore, if Congress chooses to institute a cost cap for
the  project,  it  would  be  best  to  wait  until  at  least  the  preliminary  design  review
when NASA has a better understanding of project cost. In the interim, sound project
management  as  discussed  in  GAO’s  written  statement  can  help  to  ensure  that  the
project  is  being  managed  in  a  fiscally  responsible  manner.  Another  consideration  is
the fact that instituting a cost cap on the project assumes a stable design. For exam-
ple,  as  you  know,  Congress  imposed  a  cost  cap  on  the  International  Space  Station
program.  In  our  2001  report  examining  NASA’s  compliance  with  the  cost  cap,  we
found that while NASA projections for the International Space Station through 2004
fell within the cost cap, the projections were achieved mainly by reductions in space
station content, not by prudent fiscal and project management.
Q7. Why  was  it  necessary  to  shift  almost  $7  billion  into  the  Constellation  program
[which includes the CEV and CLV] for the years FY 2006 to FY 2010 compared
to  what  NASA  had  said  would  be  needed  over  that  period  in  last  year’s  budget
request?

Q7a. Did NASA underestimate the cost of the CEV and CLV programs?
Q7b. NASA has indicated that it will not be possible to launch an operational CEV
until  2014—which  was  the  original  goal—despite  the  additional  funds  that
have been transferred into the program to ‘‘accelerate’’ it. What is that?

A7a,  7b. The  following  table  presents  changes  to  the  Constellation  Systems  budget
elements included in the President’s FY 2007 budget request. The table shows how
the  changes  in  funding  resulted  in  a  net  increase  of  nearly  $7  billion  for  FY  2006
through  2010  when  compared  with  the  totals  for  FY  2006  to  FY  2010  from  the
President’s FY 2006 budget request.

According  to  the  narrative  in  NASA’s  FY  2007  budget  justification  for  CEV,  ‘‘Ac-
celeration  of  the  program  has  resulted  in  higher  budget  numbers  then  in  the  FY
2006  submittal.’’  However,  the  budget  numbers  only  show  an  $86  million  dollar  in-
crease  in  FY  2006,  with  annual  reductions  ranging  from  $196  million  to  $410  mil-
lion in FY 2007 to FY 2010 funding. In total, funding requested for the CEV project
decreased  by  about  $1  billion  for  the  FY  2006  to  FY  2010  period  when  compared

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:55 Feb 02, 2007 Jkt 029949 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL06\092806\29949 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

to the FY 2006 budget. Funding also decreased for ISS Cargo Crew Services by $364
million. These reductions in the Constellation Systems budget were more than offset
by a $2.8 billion increase for the CLV project, an addition of $2.4 billion for the new
Launch and Mission Systems project, an addition of $448 million for the new Explo-
ration Communications and Navigation Systems project, and an additional $2.6 bil-
lion  in  funding  not  tied  to  specific  Constellation  projects.  NASA’s  FY  2007  budget
justification  did  not  break  the  funding  out  for  specific  projects  but  noted  that  the
Constellation  budget  includes  funding  for  initial  planning  for  systems  and  vehicles
necessary for lunar and Mars missions. The President’s FY 2007 budget request for
Constellation  Systems  in  FY  2011  is  $7.7  billion,  which  includes  about  $5.8  billion
for  the  five  specific  projects  in  the  table  and  about  $1.9  billion  for  funding  not  di-
rectly tied with specific projects.

Questions submitted by Representative Mark Udall
Q1. GAO  has  pointed  out  that  with  respect  to  NASA’s  budget  plan  ‘‘. . .there  are
years  when  NASA  does  not  have  sufficient  funding  to  implement  the  architec-
ture.  Some  yearly  shortfalls  exceed  $1  billion,  while  in  other  years  the  funding
available exceeds needed reserves.’’

Q1a. Are  you  aware  of  any  other  major  system  acquisition  programs  in  the  govern-
ment  that  have  been  funded  using  the  approach  being  taken  by  NASA  in  the
Constellation program?

Q1b. If so, which ones, and how well has that funding approach worked?
Q1c. Does GAO support such a funding approach?
A1a,  1b,  1c. As  we  noted  in  our  July  report  and  September  testimony,  there  is  a
substantial  mismatch  between  estimated  costs  and  the  amount  and  timing  of  the
Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate’s  five-year  budget  in  NASA  fiscal  year
2007 request. GAO’s past work has shown that matching requirements to available
and  reasonably  expected  resources  reduces  risk  and  increases  the  likelihood  of  suc-
cess for major acquisitions. In what could be an effort to offset the years of projected
funding shortfalls, NASA has been consistently accumulating a bow wave of unobli-
gated  balances  that  are  carried  over  at  the  end  of  each  year.  We  briefed  the  Com-
mittee that NASA’s actual balance of FY 2005 unobligated funds continued a trend
of  increasing  both  in  terms  of  the  dollar  amount  and  the  percentage  increase  of
budget authority. For example, NASA’s unobligated balance more than tripled from
$616  million  at  the  end  of  FY  2000  to  $2.1  billion  at  the  end  of  FY  2005—an  in-
crease from five percent of the budget to about 13 percent. While we have not looked
at other agencies with major system acquisition programs that utilize a similar ap-
proach,  it  would  appear  that  the  ability  to  carryover  large  amounts  of  unobligated
funds  affords  NASA  a  great  deal  of  flexibility  in  attempting  to  address  projected
funding shortfalls in selected programs. However, it can reduce the transparency of
the  budget  request  and  create  difficulties  for  Congress  in  determining  the  amount
and timing of budget authority it should provide to NASA.
Q2. How  confident  are  you  that  NASA  will  be  able  to  restore  the  technology  R&D
and  Space  Station  research  funding  that  was  shifted  to  the  Constellation  pro-
gram? What will be the impact if those funds are not restored?

A2. None of GAO’s current work provides it with the information necessary to com-
ment  on  whether  NASA  will  be  able  to  restore  these  funds,  nor  on  the  impact  to
Exploration Systems Research and Technology (ESRT) or Human Systems Research
and  Technology  (HSRT)  if  the  funds  are  not  restored.  According  to  NASA,  funding
was shifted from ESRT and HSRT based on the results of the Exploration Systems
Architecture  Study  (ESAS).  NASA’s  budget  indicates  that  ESAS  provided  NASA
with information that has allowed the Agency to better align the programs’ research
and  technology  development  with  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  while  maintain-
ing  fundamental  ISS  efforts  on  ISS  and  to  focus  on  technology  priorities  for  lunar
exploration. Furthermore, the overall funding for the ISS program per the FY 2007
budget submission totaled about $10.2 billion, a $200 million increase over the total
for the same period in the FY 2006 budget submission.
Q3. Are  there  any  other  areas  of  concern  that  GAO  has  about  NASA’s  implementa-
tion  of  the  President’s  exploration  initiative  that  Congress  should  be  aware  of?
A3. NASA  will  undoubtedly  be  operating  in  a  constrained  fiscal  environment,  and
it  is  imperative  that  NASA  successfully  manage  its  limited  resources  in  order  to
achieve successful outcomes. Adhering to the principles of knowledge-based acquisi-
tion is a key step in this effort, but as their efforts move forward, the Agency must

105

not  let  itself  succumb  to  the  pressures  of  meeting  self-imposed  schedules.  The  gap
between  retiring  the  Shuttle  in  2010  and  bringing  the  CEV  on-line  is  a  reality.  At-
tempting to close that gap by pushing forward development of the CEV without first
obtaining the requisite knowledge at key points could very well result in the produc-
tion  of  a  system  that  not  only  doesn’t  meet  expectations  but  ends  up  costing  more
and  actually  increasing  the  gap.  Competing  demands  within  the  Agency  could  also
instill  schedule  pressure  on  CEV  development  efforts.  For  example,  NASA  plans  to
rely on commercial providers to make up the gap in ISS logistics left by the Shuttle
retirement. We currently have work underway to assess whether ISS operations can
be  effectively  supported  in  the  interim.  NASA  must  also  effectively  manage  the
transition  of  both  its  supplier  base  and  workforce  from  the  Shuttle  program  to
planned  exploration  activities.  The  need  to  maintain  and  safely  process  the  Shuttle
through  its  final  planned  flight  in  2010  and  designing,  developing  and  testing  a
CEV in 2014 presents a difficult challenge for NASA.
Q4. If  Congress  followed  GAO’s  recommendation  to  restrict  annual  appropriations
and  limit  obligations  for  the  CEV  project  ‘‘to  only  the  amount  of  funding  nec-
essary  to  support  activities  needed  to  successfully  complete  the  project’s  prelimi-
nary design review,’’

Q4a. What  impact  would  that  have  on  NASA’s  schedule  for  developing  and  deploy-
ing  the  CEV,  including  the  impact  on  procurement  of  long-lead  items?  What
is your estimate based on?

Q4b. What impact would that have on NASA’s cost to develop and deploy the CEV?

What is your estimate based on?

A4a,  4b. If  NASA  is  approaching  the  development  of  the  CEV  using  a  knowledge-
based approach, it would not be undertaking development activities at this point un-
less  they  are  needed  to  successfully  complete  a  preliminary  design  review.  NASA’s
own  program  and  project  management  policies  call  for  a  major  decision  review  fol-
lowing  the  preliminary  design  review  to  ensure  that  the  project  is  ready  to  move
beyond  preliminary  design  activities.  A  knowledge-based  acquisition  approach  re-
quires decision makers to ask themselves, at each decision point, whether they have
gained the knowledge needed to progress into the next acquisition phase. For exam-
ple, at the preliminary design review, all technologies needed to meet essential prod-
uct requirements should have been demonstrated to work in their intended environ-
ment.  If  not,  the  program  should  not  go  forward.  GAO  has  recommended  that  the
procurement  of  long-lead  items  not  be  approved  until  the  project  can  clearly  dem-
onstrate  that  technologies  are  mature  and  the  design  is  stable.  Our  past  work  has
shown  that  increased  costs  and  schedule  slippage  may  accrue  to  programs  that  are
still  maturing  technologies  well  into  system  development  when  they  should  be  fo-
cused on stabilizing system design and preparing for production.
Q5. What  are  the  major  challenges  facing  NASA  as  it  moves  to  implement  its  Con-
stellation  program  [which  includes  both  the  CEV  and  its  Crew  Launch  Vehicle
(CLV) ]?

A5. NASA  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious  schedule  to  have  two  separate  and  dis-
tinct major acquisition programs in development concurrently. The coordination and
timing  of  development  efforts  between  the  CEV  and  the  CLV  cannot  be  overstated,
and  the  integration  of  these  programs  will  be  challenging  for  NASA.  The
functionality of the CEV is wholly dependent on the CLV. NASA plans to use herit-
age  hardware  for  the  CEV  and  CLV  in  hopes  that  it  will  simplify  and  shorten  the
development  process.  But,  given  NASA’s  planned  upgrades  to  some  components,
technology and performance risks could increase. GAO has already identified an in-
stance within the Constellation Program where the Agency has entered into a long-
term commitment without having all the elements of a sound business case, includ-
ing mature technologies and well defined requirements. Ensuring that both of these
major  acquisition  programs  are  carried  out  in  a  prudent  and  cost-effective  manner
will  not  only  be  key  to  maintaining  our  country’s  human  access  to  space  but  vital
to instilling confidence that NASA can achieve mission success.
Q6. When  NASA  announced  its  Exploration  architecture  last  fall,  the  Crew  Launch
Vehicle  (CLV)  was  supposed  to  make  use  of  flight-proven  Space  Shuttle  compo-
nents.  To  what  extent  is  that  still  the  case,  and  for  those  cases  where  Shuttle
hardware will no longer be used or will be significantly modified, how will CLV
costs and programmatic risk be affected? On what is your assessment based?

A6. GAO  is  studying  the  CLV  architecture  as  part  of  on-going  work  requested  by
this committee concerning the acquisition strategy of the project. We have not com-
pleted  our  analysis  with  regard  the  affect  of  CLV  changes  on  costs  and  pro-

grammatic  risk.  The  architecture  has  changed  since  the  completion  of  the  Explo-
ration Systems Architecture Study last fall. In January 2006, NASA announced that
the two components with direct ties to the Shuttle program—the four-segment Reus-
able  Solid  Rocket  Booster  (RSRB)  and  the  Space  Shuttle  Main  Engine  (SSME)—
would no longer be part of the CLV architecture. Instead, NASA now plans to utilize
a  newly  developed  five-segment  RSRB  for  the  CLV’s  first  stage  and  a  remanufac-
tured Saturn era J–2X engine to power the Upper Stage.

Questions submitted by Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson
Q1. Does  NASA  have  the  financial  resources  necessary  to  complete  the  acquisition

strategy that it has adopted for the CEV?

Q1a. What particular aspects of the acquisition activity have the potential for signifi-

cant cost growth?

A1,  1a. Given  the  fact  that  NASA  would  not  provide  us  with  cost  information  be-
yond  what  was  contained  in  the  fiscal  year  2007  budget  request,  we  are  not  in  a
position  to  answer  your  question.  NASA  should  provide  you  with  an  answer  as
whether  it  can  afford  the  chosen  acquisition  approach  for  the  CEV  and  the  basis
for  its  response.  From  our  perspective,  however,  NASA  has  embarked  on  a  long-
term  design  and  development  effort  without  the  requisite  knowledge.  By  making  a
long-term  commitment  prior  to  establishing  a  sound  business  case,  NASA  has  ac-
cepted  the  risk  for  potential  cost  and  schedule  growth.  It  is  unknown  at  this  point
whether  NASA  will  have  the  financial  resources  necessary  to  complete  the  adopted
acquisition strategy since realistic cost estimates are not currently available.
