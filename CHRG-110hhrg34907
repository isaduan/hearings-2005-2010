BACKGROUND
Potential Issues

The following are some of the potential issues that might be raised at the hearing:
• Impact  of  Budgetary  Cutbacks  on  NASA’s  Space  Science  Programs—
In the three years since the President’s Vision for Space Exploration was an-
nounced  in  early  2004,  the  Administration  has  reduced  NASA’s  Science  Mis-
sion Directorate outyear funding by a total of $4 billion. As a result, missions
have been delayed or deferred, supporting activities such as technology devel-
opment  have  been  decreased  and  the  prospects  for  new  activities  have  been
pushed  out  into  the  future.  At  the  same  time,  some  missions  in  development
are  costing  more  than  anticipated,  placing  further  stress  on  Science  Mission
Directorate  programs.  How  serious  a  problem  is  the  budgetary  situation  fac-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

ing  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate?  What  should  be  done  to  ensure
NASA has a sustainable and robust science program?

• Role  of  Space  Science  in  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness
Initiative  and  Innovation  Agenda—Research  funded  through  NASA’s
space  science  program  exemplifies  the  types  of  research  highlighted  in  the
National  Academies  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  and  in  the
President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative.  Specifically,  the  Academies’
recommendations for long-term basic research and ‘‘special emphasis on phys-
ical  sciences,  engineering,  mathematics,  and  information  sciences’’;  high-risk
research;  research  grants  to  early  career  researchers;  and  funding  for  ad-
vanced  research  instrumentation  and  facilities  also  apply  to  NASA.  Given
that,  why  hasn’t  NASA  space  science  been  included  in  the  President’s  Amer-
ican  Competitiveness  Initiative?  Moreover,  why  has  the  NASA-funded  re-
search  that  most  directly  applies  to  the  goals  of  the  ACI  been  declining  at  a
time  when  the  focus  on  and  funding  for  long-term  basic  research  at  other
agencies  is  increasing  under  the  ACI?  What  message  does  the  exclusion  of
NASA  research  from  the  ACI  send  to  the  community  of  space  scientists  that
performs that research? How does a strategy that promotes basic research at
some  government  R&D  agencies  while  cutting  funding  for  the  same  type  of
research  at  other  agencies  help  the  Nation  meet  the  ACI  goals  of  strength-
ening  research  in  the  physical  sciences,  engineering,  and  mathematics  and
building  the  foundation  for  innovation?  What,  if  anything,  should  be  done  to
address NASA’s absence from the ACI?

• Lack  of  Adequate  Balance—Administrator  Griffin  testified  at  the  March
15,  2007  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  hearing  on  the  NASA  FY08
budget  request  that  NASA  has  attempted  to  balance  its  science  programs.
However,  a  number  of  advisory  committees,  including,  the  National  Acad-
emies and the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee, have raised
concerns  about  the  lack  of  balance  in  NASA  science  programs.  In  its  report,
An  Assessment  of  Balance  in  NASA’s  Science  Programs  (2006),  the  National
Academies found that:

‘‘The  program  proposed  for  space  and  Earth  science  is  not  robust;  it  is  not
properly  balanced  to  support  a  healthy  mix  of  small,  medium,  and  large
missions  and  an  underlying  foundation  of  scientific  research  and  advanced
technology projects.’’

According to the Assessment of Balance report, lack of balance, sustainability
and  robustness  in  NASA’s  science  programs  affects  the  ability  to  make
progress  on  the  Decadal  Surveys  (research  priorities  for  the  next  ten  years
in  specific  space  science  disciplines  that  represent  a  consensus  of  the  science
community);  to  follow  a  plan  or  sequence  of  missions,  to  meet  commitments
to  international  partners;  to  develop  advanced  technology;  to  nurture  a  re-
search and technology community; and to train and educate future space sci-
entists  and  engineers.  What  is  NASA’s  definition  of  balance?  What,  if  any-
thing  has  NASA  done  in  response  to  findings  of  the  advisory  committees?
What does a properly balanced program look like?

• Cuts  to  smaller  science  mission  opportunities—Cutbacks  in  small-  and
medium-sized mission opportunities, such as are offered by the Explorer pro-
gram,  are  cited  in  advisory  committee  reports  as  indicators  of  a  science  pro-
gram  lacking  balance.  Explorer  missions,  which  are  highly  rated  in  the
decadal  surveys,  are  competitively  awarded  missions  that  are  led  by  a  sci-
entist principal investigator (PI) who is given responsibility for the scientific,
technical, and management success of the mission. Explorers examine focused
science areas not addressed by NASA’s larger, agency-led, strategic missions.
They  provide  flight  opportunities  in  the  gaps  between  strategic  missions  and
are critical opportunities for the much-needed training of the next generation
of  scientists  and  engineers.  That  the  Nobel  Prize  in  physics  for  2006  was
awarded  to  two  U.S.  researchers  whose  work  relied  on  data  from  the  Cosmic
Background  Explorer  (COBE)  exemplifies  the  scientific  potential  of  these
small  spacecraft.  Should  funds  be  restored  to  increase  the  flight  rate  of  Ex-
plorer and other small- and medium-sized missions, and at what cost to other
missions  or  science  activities?  What  is  the  appropriate  frequency  of  small-
and  medium-sized  missions  needed  to  sustain  the  scientific  activities  and  re-
searcher  base  that  relies  on  such  flight  opportunities?  Should  future  budgets
fence  off  a  certain  percentage  of  resources  for  small-  and  medium-sized  mis-
sions such as Explorer?

• Cuts  to  Research  and  Analysis—According  to  advisory  committee  reports
such  as  An  Assessment  of  Balance  in  NASA’s  Science  Programs  and  the  An-
nual  Report  of  the  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Advisory  Committee,  March
16,  2006–March  15,  2007,  a  properly  balanced  science  program  is  defined,  in
part, by the support provided for research grants, largely through NASA’s re-
search  and  analysis  (R&A)  accounts.  R&A  grants  fund  theory,  modeling,  and
the  analysis  of  mission  data;  technology  development  for  future  science  mis-
sions;  the  development  of  concepts  for  potential  future  science  missions;  sci-
entific  investigations  using  aircraft,  balloons,  and  sub-orbital  rockets;  the
training  of  the  next  generation  of  scientists  and  engineers,  among  a  host  of
other  supporting  research  and  technology  activities.  The  FY06  NASA  oper-
ating  plan  cut  R&A  accounts  by  about  15  percent  across  the  science  pro-
grams,  reducing  support  for  graduate  students,  post-doctoral  students  and
junior faculty. The FY07 request did not restore those cuts, and the FY08 re-
quest  largely  continues  the  previous  levels  of  funding  for  R&A.  What  is  a
healthy  level  of  R&A  funding  within  the  NASA  science  programs?  How  long
can  the  research  community  sustain  lower  levels  of  activity  before  attrition
occurs,  along  with  a  loss  of  expertise  that  cannot  be  easily  recovered?  What,
if  anything,  should  be  done  about  the  current  level  of  R&A  funding?  Should
measures be instituted to protect R&A funding against future cuts, and if so,
what would those measures be?

• Cost Growth in Missions—Several of the increases in NASA’s FY08 budget
request  provide  funds  for  science  missions  that  have  run  over  budget  or
schedule,  or  that  run  the  risk  of  doing  so.  In  addition,  cost  growth  in  some
of  the  planned  space  science  missions  in  recent  years,  coupled  with  con-
strained budgets, has wound up squeezing other science activities. The factors
contributing to cost and schedule growth are not easy to pinpoint, but can in-
clude  underestimates  in  the  technology  development  required  for  mission
readiness;  increases  in  launch  vehicle  costs;  internal  decisions  to  delay  mis-
sions  or  alter  budget  profiles;  project  management  difficulties;  and  delays  in
contributions  from  international  or  interagency  partners.  Lack  of  clarity  in
the communication of what is included in those costs (e.g., technology develop-
ment,  mission  development,  operations)  has  also  contributed  to  the  problem.
Mission  cost  growth  can  lead  to  delays,  cancellations,  or  reduction  in  funds
for  other  NASA  science  missions  and  activities.  What,  if  anything,  can  be
done  to  control  cost  growth  on  missions?  Is  there  adequate  understanding  of
the  cost  growth  contributors  or  is  more  information  needed  to  come  up  with
solutions to the cost growth problem?

• Role of Space Science in Human and Robotic Exploration of the Solar
System—Robotic  exploration  of  the  solar  system  is  called  out  in  the  Presi-
dent’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  as  being  important  to  achieving  the  Vi-
sion. The Report of the President’s Commission on Implementation of United
States  Space  Exploration  Policy  states  that  ‘‘science  in  the  space  exploration
vision  is  both  enabling  and  enabled.’’  What  should  be  the  role  of  science  ac-
tivities in the context of the Vision for Space Exploration? Should science that
supports the Vision have a higher priority?

• Future  Availability  of  the  Delta  II  Launch  Vehicle—The  Delta  II  has
been  a  highly  reliable  workhorse  for  space  science  missions.  Over  the  next
two  years,  eight  missions  are  scheduled  to  launch  on  Delta  IIs,  however,
NASA has expressed uncertainty about the availability of the Delta II launch
vehicle  after  2009  and  is  studying  alternatives.  What  is  the  status  of  the
Delta  II  availability  for  science  payloads  after  2009?  If  the  Delta  II  is  not
available,  what  is  the  plan  for  launching  Delta-class  science  missions?  What
are  the  alternatives  to  the  Delta  II  and  what  are  the  likely  impacts  of  using
an  alternative  vehicle?  If  launch  costs  increase,  does  NASA  plan  to  alter  the
levels of cost-capped missions?

• Technology Development and Supporting Programs—missions proposed
with  immature  technologies  can  be  a  root  cause  of  cost  growth.  The  Acad-
emies  report  on  Principal-Investigator-Led  Missions  in  the  Space  Sciences
states  that  ‘‘. . .project  technology  development  efforts  often  lag  planned
progress owing to unexpected design failures, fabrication or testing issues, or
other glitches. . . .attempts by mission projects to using promising but imma-
ture  technology  is  a  frequent  cause  of  PI-led  missions  (and  others)  exceeding
the cost cap.’’ The FY08 budget request decreases funding for the New Millen-
nium  Program  and  the  research  and  analysis  programs  both  of  which  enable
technology  development  for  future  missions.  In  light  of  the  cost  growth  and

6

technical  challenges  encountered  by  several  science  missions,  will  reductions
in  technology  development  programs  increase  the  risk  of  cost  growth  on  fu-
ture missions? Have technology development programs been an adequate and
effective  means  of  understanding  technical  risks  and  mission  costs?  If  not,
why  and  what  other  mechanisms  are  available  to  prepare  for  technical  chal-
lenges on future missions?

• International  Partnerships—NASA  has  a  successful  history  of  inter-
national  cooperation  in  science  and  involves  non-U.S.  partners  on  some  two-
thirds of its science missions, and also provides instruments, science support,
and  other  in-kind  contributions  to  non-U.S.-led  space  and  Earth  science  mis-
sions.  Successful  cooperative  missions  can  increase  the  scientific  content  of  a
mission  and  build  mutually  beneficial  relationships.  At  the  same  time,  co-
operation can lead to delays and added mission costs. Among the factors that
have made international cooperative missions harder in recent years is ITAR.
Pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778 of the Arms Export Control Act, the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) regulates the export of defense articles on
the  U.S.  Munitions  Control  List.  The  Department  of  State  has  responsibility
for  administering  the  regulations.  In  1999,  scientific  satellites  were  added  to
the  Munitions  Control  List  (USML).  ITAR  often  poses  significant  challenges
for space science missions, many of which involve international partners. The
time  required  to  manage  licenses  or  agreements  can  threaten  mission  sched-
ules. ITAR can be especially problematic for U.S. universities, which typically
attract  a  large  percentage  of  foreign  graduate  students  to  their  programs.  Is
increasing international cooperation on planned and future missions feasible,
given recent experiences with ITAR? What factors associated with ITAR must
be considered before agreeing to international collaborations?

Overview

Over  the  past  five  decades,  NASA  has  fostered  a  world-class  space  science  pro-
gram  that  has  led  to  such  discoveries  as  new  planets  outside  our  solar  system,  the
presence  of  dark  energy  and  the  acceleration  of  an  expanding  Universe,  the  signs
of possible recent liquid water flows on Mars, and more knowledge of the Sun’s inte-
rior  structure  and  activity.  NASA  missions  have  also  improved  our  understanding
of  the  effects  of  solar  activity  and  space  radiation  on  ground-based  electrical  power
grids  and  wireless  communications  systems,  on  orbiting  satellites,  and  also  on  hu-
mans  in  space.  The  space  science  program’s  technical  achievements  are  equally
stunning  as  demonstrated  in  the  successful  landing  and  operation  of  Mars  rovers
Spirit and Opportunity; the recent deployment of five spacecraft to study the causes
of the changing auroras at the North Pole, and Deep Impact’s successful penetration
of  the  comet  Tempel  1.  In  2006,  Dr.  John  Mather  and  Dr.  George  Smoot  were
awarded  the  Nobel  Prize  in  physics  for  their  work  with  the  NASA  Cosmic  Back-
ground  Explorer.  [Dr.  Mather  is  the  first  NASA  civil  servant  to  receive  the  Nobel
prize.]

This hearing will examine NASA’s space science programs within NASA’s Science
Mission  Directorate  (SMD)  and  their  status  within  the  context  of  the  Fiscal  Year
2008 budget request. The space science programs include the following theme areas:
• Heliophysics, which seeks to understand the Sun and its effects on Earth and

the rest of the solar system;

• Planetary  science,  which  seeks  to  understand  the  origin  and  evolution  of  the

solar system and the prospects for life beyond Earth; and

• Astrophysics,  which  seeks  to  understand  the  origin,  structure,  evolution  and

future of the Universe and to search for Earth-like planets.

Earth  science  is  also  an  SMD  theme  area.  It  will  be  the  topic  of  a  separate  Sub-

committee hearing.

It should also be noted that Dr. Stern has informed the Subcommittee that he has
gotten agreement to move NASA’s Near-Earth Objects (NEO) program, and its asso-
ciated budget, from the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate to the Science Mis-
sion Directorate.

NASA’s space science programs involve the following types of activities:

• space  missions  that  take  measurements  and  collect  data  to  investigate  high

priority science questions;

• the analysis of that mission data, which leads to new knowledge;
• research on theories and models;

• the  development  of  new  technologies  to  enable  future  science  investigations;

and

• the use of balloons, sounding rockets, and sub-orbital flights to take measure-

ments and test technologies.

Stakeholders  in  the  NASA  space  science  programs  include  academic  institutions;
industry;  NASA  field  centers,  predominantly  the  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center
(GSFC)  and  the  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL);  and  other  government  labora-
tories.  There  are  a  number  of  advisory  panels  that  provided  guidance  on  NASA’s
space  science  programs  and  activities,  including  the  NASA  Advisory  Council  (NAC)
and  the  NAC  Science  Subcommittees,  the  National  Academies,  and  the  Astronomy
and Astrophysics Advisory Committee (AAAC).

Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request

The President’s FY08 budget requests $4.019 billion to fund NASA’s space science
programs—heliophysics, planetary science, and astrophysics. The budget represents
a  $16.5  million  increase  (or  about  0.4  percent)  over  the  President’s  proposed  FY07
budget.  (Appendix  A  presents  the  President’s  FY08  budget  request  for  NASA  space
science programs.) Space science programs represent 23.2 percent of the President’s
total  FY08  budget  request  for  NASA.  Within  the  proposed  FY08  budget  for  space
sciences  programs,  heliophysics  represents  26  percent,  planetary  science  represents
35 percent and astrophysics represents 39 percent of the total space science funding.
Comparing  the  President’s  FY08  budget  request  with  the  funding  requested  for
FY08–FY11  in  the  President’s  FY07  proposal  (and  under  full  cost  simplification)
shows  that  planetary  science  gains  $87M,  while  heliophysics  loses  over  $300M  and
astrophysics  is  decreased  by  about  $125M.  The  FY08  budget  request  shows  the  fol-
lowing  cumulative  results  for  individual  science  missions,  over  the  FY08–FY11  pe-
riod, relative to the President’s FY07 budget request:

• NASA  adds  funding  to  support  the  development  of  several  key  missions  and

mission areas, including (in millions of dollars):

• However,  there  are  significant  funding  cuts  to  other  space  science  activities,

activities over the same period, such as (in millions of dollars):

mission;  and  complete  contributions  to  international  and  interagency  partner  mis-
sions that are planned for launch in 2008.

Heliophysics

The  President’s  FY08  budget  request  for  NASA  includes  $1.057  billion  for  the
Heliophysics theme, which seeks to understand the Sun and its effect on the Earth,
the rest of the solar system, and the conditions in the space environment and their
effects on astronauts; and to develop and demonstrate technologies to predict space
weather.

Programs within the Heliophysics theme include:

• Heliophysics Research—research and analysis; space missions; sounding rock-

ets and other scientific platforms; science data and computing technology;

• Living  with  a  Star—investigations  to  understand  solar  variability  (space
weather), its effect on the Earth and the rest of the solar system, and the im-
plications for ground-based systems such as electric power grids and wireless
communications,  and  for  on-orbit  spacecraft  and  astronauts.  Space  missions
under the Living with a Star program include:

Æ Solar  Dynamics  Observatory  (SDO)  to  understand  the  structure  of  the
Sun’s magnetic field and how magnetic field energy forms the solar wind,
energetic particles, and fluctuations in solar irradiance. SDO will help ac-
quire  data  to  enable  space  weather  predictions.  SDO  is  slated  to  launch
in 2008.

Æ Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) to investigate solar storms and their
interaction with charged particles, fields, and radiation in the Van Allen
radiation belts. The results of the mission will be used to develop models
that  assist  engineers  in  designing  systems  to  withstand  radiation  effects
and to alert pilots and crews of potentially hazardous solar storms or ra-
diation. RBSP is estimated to launch around 2012.

• Solar  Terrestrial  Probes—missions  to  investigate  the  Sun,  the  heliosphere,
and  planetary  environments  as  an  interrelated  system.  Missions  within  the
Solar Terrestrial Probe program include:

Æ Magnetospheric Multi-scale (MMS) is proposed as a system of four space-
craft  to  investigate  processes  such  as  magnetic  reconnection,  which  in-
volves  the  transfer  of  energy  from  the  solar  wind  to  the  Earth’s
magnetosphere,  and  is  an  important  factor  in  predicting  space  weather.
The estimated launch date for MMS is 2013.

• Heliophysics  Explorer  Program—small  and  medium-class  competitively-se-
lected  missions  that  endeavor  to  provide  frequent  flight  opportunities  to  in-
vestigate  focused  research.  Explorer  programs  are  cost-capped  and  awarded
to  individual  principal  investigators  who  have  sole  responsibility  for  the  sci-
entific and technical success of the mission.

• New  Millennium—a  program  to  validate  technologies  for  use  in  future  space
science missions. The program reduces the risk of new technologies that have
not yet been flown in space.

• Deep  Space  Mission  Systems—telecommunications  and  navigation  services
(e.g.,  the  Deep  Space  Network)  to  support  human  and  robotic  exploration  of
the  solar  system.  [This  program  is  located  in  Heliophysics  as  a  bookkeeping
function in the FY08 request.]

Issues

• ‘‘Flagship’’  missions  including  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope,  which  is
under  development  in  the  Astrophysics  Program,  and  the  Cassini  mission
which  is  currently  investigating  Saturn,  for  the  Planetary  Science  program,
represent  long-term,  high  priority  scientific  investigations  for  those  dis-
ciplines.  The  National  Academies  decadal  survey  for  solar  and  space  physics
recommended  in  2003  the  Solar  Probe  as  a  flagship  mission  to  measure  the
heating and acceleration of the solar wind. According to NASA’s Science Plan
for  2007–2016,  ‘‘a  flagship  mission  cannot  be  supported  within  the  available
funding resources.’’ What are NASA’s plans for Solar Probe and why are flag-
ship  missions  being  pursued  in  other  science  disciplines  but  not  in
Heliophysics?  How  does  the  absence  of  a  Solar  Probe  mission  affect  the  bal-
ance of the Heliophysics program?

Planetary Science

9

The President’s FY08 budget request provides $1.396 billion to fund NASA’s Plan-

etary Science theme, which seeks to understand:

• the history and evolution of the solar system;
• whether life existed or exists beyond Earth.

The FY08 budget represents a decrease of $15.4 million or one percent cut relative

to the President’s FY07 budget request for planetary science.

The Planetary Science program includes the following elements:

• Mars Exploration—several mission projects aimed at exploring Mars for indi-
cators  of  life,  helping  to  understand  the  history  of  the  solar  system,  and  to
improving  our  understanding  of  the  potential  hazards  to  humans  in  future
Mars explorations.

Æ Mars  Scout  2007  (Phoenix)  is  a  mission  to  help  understand  the  chem-
istry, mineralogy and composition of gases in surface and subsurface soils
at  areas  in  the  northern  latitudes  of  Mars.  The  Mars  Scout  line  is  led
by  a  principal  investigator,  a  scientist  who  is  selected  competitively  to
lead the development of a mission and ensure its scientific and technical
success.  Mars  Scout  missions  are  cost-capped  at  $475M  (FY06  dollars).
Phoenix is scheduled for launch in August, 2007.

Æ Mars  Science  Laboratory  is  a  NASA  strategic  rover  mission  designed
with  a  new  entry,  descent  and  landing  system  to  take  measurements  fo-
cused on identifying possible Martian habitats for life. Mars Science Lab-
oratory is scheduled for launch in 2009.

• Discovery  Program—a  program  of  missions  that  offer  scientists  opportunities
to  form  a  team  and  submit  a  proposal  to  design  and  develop  innovative,  me-
dium-sized,  missions  that  address  focused  science  objectives.  Proposals  are
competed; NASA awards funds to the scientist, as principal investigator, lead-
ing  the  selected  proposal.  Principal  investigators  are  responsible  for  the  sci-
entific,  technical  and  managerial  success  of  the  mission.  Discovery  missions
are  cost-capped  at  $425M,  according  to  the  Announcement  of  Opportunity
issued in 2006. Discovery missions under development include Dawn—a mis-
sion whose purpose is to visit and study Vesta and Ceres, the two largest as-
teroids in the solar system. Dawn is scheduled for launch in June 2007.
• New Frontiers—offers opportunities for scientists to form a team and propose
to design and develop innovative, medium-sized missions that focus on under-
standing  the  origin,  evolution,  and  formation  of  the  solar  system.  New  Fron-
tiers  missions  are  led  by  principal  investigators  and  have  a  cost-cap  up  to
$700M in FY03 dollars, as of 2006. New Frontiers missions include:

Æ New Horizons, launched in 2006, which is en route to Pluto where it will
collect  data  about  the  geology  and  atmosphere  of  Pluto  and  its  moon,
Charon.

Æ Juno,  a  mission  that  is  being  planned  to  investigate  several  aspects  of
Jupiter including its interior structure and its atmosphere. Juno is being
planned  for  launch  in  2011.  Juno  is  a  high  priority  mission  of  both  the
National  Academies’  solar  system  exploration  and  solar  and  space  phys-
ics decadal surveys.

• Technology—a  program  to  develop  Radioisotope  Power  Systems  such  as
radioisotopic  thermoelectric  generators  and  In-Space  Propulsion  technologies
such  as  solar  electric  propulsion  and  solar  sail  propulsion  that  enable  solar
system  exploration  missions  to  reach  distant  outer  planets  at  lower  costs,
with less mass, and for shorter travel times.
• Planetary Science Research includes research and analysis, lunar science and
funding  for  existing  missions  and  planetary  data  archiving.  Specific  program
elements include:

Æ Research  and  Analysis  programs  involve  the  development  of  theory  and
instrumentation  to  enable  future  planetary  science  missions  as  well  as
research  on  specific  interdisciplinary  areas  such  as  astrobiology  and
cosmochemistry  (research  on  the  origins  and  evolution  of  planetary  sys-
tems and for study of the atmospheres, geology, and chemistry of planets
in the solar system).

Æ Lunar  Science  is  a  new  program  in  the  FY08  request,  which  provides
funds  for  the  archiving  of  lunar  science  data,  lunar  science  instruments

and payloads that are selected through peer review, analysis of data from
lunar  missions,  and  technology  development  for  lunar  science  missions.
The planetary science research program also supports planetary data systems
and  astromaterials  curation;  the  Cassini  Huygens  mission;  U.S.  involvement
in  non-U.S.  missions  such  as  the  European  cometary  mission,  Rosetta,  and
the Japanese cometary sample return mission, Hayabusa.

Issues

• NASA  created  the  interdisciplinary  field  of  astrobiology  in  the  late  1990s  to
increase  knowledge  on  the  origin  and  evolution  of  life  on  Earth  and  beyond
Earth.  Two  National  Academies  decadal  surveys  strongly  support
Astrobiology,  and  Astrobiology  contributes  to  NASA’s  own  strategic  goal  to
‘‘Advance  scientific  knowledge  of  the  origin  and  history  of  the  solar  system,
the potential for life elsewhere, and the hazards and resources present as hu-
mans  explore  space,’’  as  stated  in  the  2006  NASA  Strategic  Plan.  According
to  the  January–March  2007  Newsletter  of  the  National  Academies’  Space
Studies Board, over the last two years, NASA cut the budget for Astrobiology
by 50 percent, from approximately $65 million to $31 million. In FY07, reduc-
tions  in  the  astrobiology  budget  reduced  the  number  of  research  institutions
participating  as  part  of  the  NASA  Astrobiology  Institute  from  16  to  12,  and
the  funding  for  those  12  teams  was  reduced.  [The  Astrobiology  Institute  is  a
consortium of institutions that have been competitively selected and provided
seed  funding  for  astrobiology  research  programs.]  No  new  research  has  been
provided  in  the  Astrobiology  Science  and  Technology  for  Exploring  Planets
program or the Astrobiology Science and Technology Instrument Development
program since 2004. Funding for grants in the exobiology and evolutionary bi-
ology  program  has  been  delayed.  The  cuts  to  the  research  program  have  af-
fected  graduate  students,  post-doctoral  students  and  junior  faculty,  who  rely
on grant funding for their research. The decrease in available funding and re-
search  opportunities  is  expected  to  discourage  younger  scientists  from  enter-
ing the field.
• The  FY08  budget  request  adds  $27  million  of  new  content  in  FY08  through
the creation of a lunar science research program in the Planetary Science Re-
search line. The total funding budgeted for lunar science through FY 2012 is
$350 million. The goals for the lunar science program over the next five years
include  archiving  of  data  from  the  lunar  precursor  robotics  missions;  launch-
ing  missions  of  opportunity  for  scientific  instruments  on  lunar  precursor
robotic  missions  or  international  lunar  missions  and  funding  the  analysis  of
data  from  those  missions.  Plans  for  the  lunar  science  program  also  involve
providing  opportunities  for  developing  instruments  and  technologies  to  sup-
port  lunar  science  studies  and  investigations.  What  priority  will  the  new
lunar science program have relative to other space science research activities?
Is it intended to support the human lunar exploration program, or is it inde-
pendent of that initiative?

Astrophysics

The  President’s  NASA  FY08  budget  request  includes  $1.566  billion  to  fund
NASA’s Astrophysics program, which seeks to improve our understanding of the ori-
gin,  structure,  evolution  and  future  of  the  Universe  and  to  search  for  Earth-like
planets. The FY08 request represents a $2.8 million or .02 percent increase over the
President’s FY07 budget proposal.

The Astrophysics program includes the following elements:

• Astrophysics  Research  includes  managing  operating  missions;  managing,
archiving, and disseminating mission data; funding science research and data
analysis; and technology development
• Gamma-ray  Large  Space  Telescope  (GLAST)  is  a  mission  being  conducted
with  NASA  and  the  Department  of  Energy.  The  mission  will  take  measure-
ments  of  high-energy  gamma  rays  in  an  effort  to  understand  their  sources
and behavior. GLAST is scheduled for launch in November 2007.
• Kepler  is  a  competitively-selected  principal  investigator-led  mission  in  the
Discovery program that will search for Earth-like planets. Kepler is scheduled
for launch in November 2008.
• James  Webb  Space  Telescope  (JWST)  is  an  infrared  observatory  involving  a
6.5m  aperture  mirror  and  sunshade  that  will  unfold  upon  deployment  in
space.  JWST  will  enable  scientific  study  of  the  early  Universe  and  of  the  de-

velopment of galaxies, stars, planetary systems and the elements required for
life.  JWST  is  the  top-ranked  mission  from  the  last  National  Academies
decadal survey in astronomy and astrophysics and is considered the successor
to the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST is slated for launch in 2013.
• Hubble Space Telescope is a space observatory currently utilized to study and
understand  the  formation,  structure,  and  evolution  of  stars  and  galaxies  in
the  visible,  near  infrared  and  ultraviolet  wavelengths.  The  Hubble  was  de-
signed  to  be  serviced  from  space.  The  fourth  Shuttle  servicing  mission  is
scheduled for September 2008 to replace batteries, gyroscopes, and other sys-
tems  necessary  for  operating  capabilities  and  to  add  new  scientific  instru-
ments. Hubble was launched in 1990.
• Navigator Program involves several projects aimed at the search for habitable

planets beyond the solar system:

Æ Space Interferometer-PlanetQuest (SIM) is a mission to conduct a census
of  planetary  systems  and  to  identify  the  location  and  masses  of  targets
for potential further study. SIM is a technology development project.

Æ Terrestrial  Planet  Finder  (TPF)  is  a  concept  for  a  space  mission  that
would  detect  planets  similar  to  Earth  in  the  areas  of  nearby  stars  that
are  considered  possible  for  the  formation  of  Earth-like  planets.  TPF
would  collect  and  analyze  data  on  the  spectra  of  planets  it  identified  for
possible signs of life. TPF is a technology development project.

Æ The Keck Interferometer (KI) is a ground-based effort currently under de-
velopment to measure the dust and gas around stars, especially the inner
region of stars where Earth-like planets may form.

Æ Large  Binocular  Telescope  Interferometer  (LBTI)  in  under  development
and  will  take  measurements  of  the  dust  and  gas  surrounding  stars,  in-
cluding  the  outer  ranges  of  disks  around  stars  where  it  is  thought  that
Jupiter-like planets might form and evolve.

• Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is an astronomical
observatory  to  help  understand  the  birth  and  death  of  stars,  how  new  solar
systems  form,  among  other  astrophysical  questions.  The  SOFIA  observatory
includes  a  2.5  meter  telescope,  provided  by  the  German  Aerospace  Center
(DLR), that will be mounted on a customized Boeing 747 aircraft.
• Astrophysics  Explorer  Program  provides  opportunities  for  researchers  to  as-
semble  a  team  and  propose  to  design  and  develop  a  focused  science  mission.
Explorer missions are led by principal investigators and are cost-capped. The
program  is  intended  to  offer  frequent  flight  opportunities  and  to  conduct  fo-
cused  science  investigations  that  complement  larger,  NASA-developed  stra-
tegic  missions.  Astrophysics  Explorer  missions  in  development  include  Wide-
Field  Infrared  Survey  Explorer  (WISE)  which  seeks,  as  a  main  objective,  to
find the brightest galaxies in the Universe. WISE is slated for launch in 2009.
• International  Space  Science  Collaboration,  which  involves  the  U.S.  contribu-
tion  of  instruments,  subsystems,  and  U.S.  investigators  to  two  European-led
missions.
• Beyond  Einstein,  a  program  including  space  missions,  research  and  theory
work,  and  technology  development  aimed  at  improving  our  understanding  of
proposed  missions  to  help  understand  Einstein’s  theory  of  general  relativity
and  its  predictions  about  the  Big  Bang,  black  holes,  and  dark  energy.  NASA
has  commissioned  a  National  Academies  study  to  recommend  which  Beyond
Einstein  mission  should  be  developed  and  launched  first.  The  Beyond  Ein-
stein  program,  as  described  in  NASA’s  FY08  budget  request  documentation,
includes:

Æ Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a collaborative mission with

the European Space Agency to measure gravitational waves.

Æ Constellation-X Observatory (Con-X), a mission that will harness the col-
lective  power  of  several  x-ray  telescopes  to  investigate  black  holes,  Ein-
stein’s theory of general relativity, the formation of galaxies, and the na-
ture of dark matter and dark energy, among other science goals.

Æ Joint  Dark  Energy  Mission,  which  will  study  the  nature  of  dark  energy

in the Universe and the expansion of the Universe.

Æ Beyond  Einstein  Future  Missions,  which  include  an  Inflation  Probe  to
study  the  causes  of  the  inflation  of  the  Universe  and  Black  Hole  Finder
Probe,  which  will  conduct  a  census  of  black  holes  to  identify  where  they
are and when and how they form.

• The Navigator Program, a project within the Astrophysics theme, seeks to un-
derstand how planets and planetary systems form, search for planets around
other  stars,  and  characterize  those  planets  and  their  environments  for  signs
of  potential  life.  The  Space  Interferometer-PlanetQuest  (SIM)  mission  along
with  the  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder  (TPF)  mission  are  integral  components  of
the Navigator Program. The 2001 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey
recommends  SIM  for  completion  and  TPF  as  a  technology  development
project.  The  President’s  FY07  request  for  NASA  delayed  SIM  to  a  potential
2015  or  2016  launch  and  deferred  TPF  development  indefinitely.  The  FY08
request  cuts  $800M  from  the  Navigator  Program  between  FY08  and  FY11.
The  FY08  request  does  provide  funds  ($35.5M)  for  reinstating  technology  de-
velopment work on TPF. What is the appropriate path for the Navigator pro-
gram? Should funding be restored to put SIM back on track for mission devel-
opment?  Should  funding  for  TPF  technology  development  be  increased?
Should  both  the  SIM  and  TPF  missions  be  deferred  until  they  can  be  recon-
sidered in the next decadal survey?

• As  can  be  seen  in  the  chart  below,  a  large  number  of  highly  recommended
astrophysics  missions  have  been  delayed,  canceled,  or  deferred.  At  the  same
time,  the  recent  National  Academies  Assessment  of  NASA’s  Astrophysics  Pro-
gram  noted  that:  ‘‘Although  six  astrophysics  Explorer  missions  have  been
launched in the current decade, those launches are the result of development
work  performed  mostly  in  the  1990s.  At  this  point  it  appears  that  only  one
Explorer mission will be developed and launched in this decade, and at most
one  Explorer  will  begin  development  in  this  decade  for  launch  in  the  next.’’
What  is  the  outlook  for  the  Astrophysics  program  if  current  trends  continue,
and what should be done?

• The President’s FY08 budget request includes an estimate for a Space Shuttle
servicing mission of the Hubble Space Telescope in May 2008, and the budget
proposes  funding  to  support  that  date.  An  updated  Shuttle  manifest  moved
the  mission  to  September  2008,  leaving  a  gap  of  four  months  or  $40  million
($10  million  a  month  in  costs).  The  current  tentative  Shuttle  manifest  has
moved  the  mission  forward  to  an  August  2008  launch,  although  further
changes  and  launch  delays  could  widen  the  funding  shortfall.  It  is  not  yet
clear where NASA will find the $40 million to fill the gap.

Chairman  UDALL.  Good  morning.  This  hearing  will  come  to
order.  I  would  like  to  begin  by  welcoming  all  of  our  witnesses  to
today’s  hearing.  We  have  a  distinguished  panel  that  can  provide
this  subcommittee  with  important  perspectives  on  the  state  of
NASA’s  space  science  activities.  In  particular,  I  would  like  to  wel-
come  Dr.  Alan  Stern,  the  new  Associate  Administrator  of  NASA’s
Science  Mission  Directorate.  I  got  to  know  Dr.  Stern  when  he  was
at the Southwest Research Institute, and I look forward to working
with him in his new role.

As  Chairman  Calvert  reminded  me,  he  is  also  a  constituent  of

mine and I am glad to have Alan here.

I would also like to welcome Dr. Dan Baker, who is the Director
of  University  of  Colorado’s  laboratory  for  Atmospheric  and  Space
Physics  in  Boulder,  Colorado,  also  a  constituent.  Dr.  Baker,  great
to have you.

As  can  be  seen  by  the  title  of  today’s  hearing,  we  are  going  to
focus  on  a  subset  of  NASA’s  science  activities,  mainly  its  astro-
physics,  planetary  science,  and  heliophysics  programs.  Obviously,
NASA’s  Earth  science  program  is  an  important  element  of  NASA’s
overall science program, but it will be the focus of a separate hear-
ing that will expand on the Full Committee hearing we held earlier
this year.

In  addition,  while  not  currently  part  of  the  Science  Mission  Di-
rectorate,  NASA’  life  and  microgravity  research  programs  are  also
important  research  endeavors  that  will  be  scrutinized  by  this  sub-
committee in the coming months, particularly in light of the deep—
and  many  would  say,  unwise—cuts  that  NASA  has  made  to  those
programs.  To  paraphrase  Dickens,  it  is  both  the  best  of  times  and
the worst of times for NASA’S space science programs.

We  have  witnessed  a  whole  series  of  exciting  events  in  recent
months, whether it be the discovery of possible recent liquid water
flows  on  Mars,  stereo  images  of  solar  activity,  or  Nobel  Prizes
awarded  for  research  enabled  by  NASA’s  cosmic  background  ex-
plorer.  These  are  just  a  few  of  the  accomplishments  of  NASA’s
space science enterprise over the last few years.

In  short,  NASA’s  space  science  programs  are  highly  productive
and  exciting  in  addressing  compelling  scientific  questions.  That  is
the good news.

What  is  the  bad  news?  The  bad  news  is  that  while  those  accom-
plishments  were  enabled  by  the  Nation’s  past  investments  in
NASA’s science activities, the outlook for the needed future invest-
ments is not good if present trends are any indication.

For  example,  the  five-year  funding  plan  for  NASA’s  science  mis-
sion directorate has been reduced by a total of $4 billion since fiscal
year 2005, which is a significant disruption. In addition, the impact
of  those  cuts  to  NASA’S  out  year  science  funding  is  magnified  by
cost  growth  that  has  occurred  within  some  science  missions  under
development,  cost  growth  that  is  putting  additional  stress  on  the
overall space science program.

Another  example:  the  Explorer  Program,  which  has  enabled
major  scientific  discoveries,  has  seen  new  mission  opportunities
dramatically  curtailed.  Funding  for  research  and  analysis  which
helps to enable scientific research and train the next generation of
scientists  and  engineers  was  cut  by  15  percent  in  fiscal  year  2007.

Those  cuts  were  also  applied  retroactively  to  fiscal  year  2006,  and
that reduced R&A funding level was maintained in the ’08 request.
Moreover,  that  15  percent  R&A  cut  was  an  average  cut  with

some disciplines suffering much deeper cuts.

In  short,  at  a  time  when  NASA’s  science  programs  offer  the
promise  of  major  advances  in  our  understanding  of  the  Sun,  the
solar  system,  and  the  universe  beyond,  we  risk  long-term  damage
to  the  health  of  those  programs  if  we  are  not  careful.  That  is  why
I look forward to hearing from Dr. Stern and the rest of our expert
panel today. We need to get their best assessment of the challenges
facing  NASA’s  space  science  program,  and  the  likely  consequences
of  inaction,  and  most  importantly,  their  recommendations  for  ad-
dressing those challenges.

At  the  end  of  the  day,  however,  it  is  clear  to  me  that  if  we  are
going to ask our nation’s space science program to undertake chal-
lenging and meaningful initiatives, we are going to need to provide
the necessary resources.

In  closing,  again,  I  want  to  welcome  our  witnesses,  and  I  now
yield to my colleague, my good friend Ranking Member Calvert, for
any opening remarks he would like to make.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Udall follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MARK UDALL

Good morning. I’d like to begin by welcoming all of our witnesses to today’s hear-
ing. We have a distinguished panel that can provide this subcommittee with impor-
tant perspectives on the state of NASA’s space science activities.

In particular, I would like to welcome Dr. Alan Stern, the new Associate Adminis-
trator  of  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate.  I  got  to  know  Dr.  Stern  a  bit  when
he was at the Southwest Research Institute, and I look forward to working with him
in his new role.

I’d  also  like  to  welcome  Dr.  Dan  Baker,  Director  of  the  University  of  Colorado’s

Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder, Colorado.

As  can  be  seen  by  the  title  of  today’s  hearing,  we  are  going  to  focus  on  a  subset
of  NASA’s  science  activities,  namely  its  astrophysics,  planetary  science,  and
heliophysics programs.

Obviously,  NASA’s  Earth  Science  program  is  an  important  element  of  NASA’s
overall  science  program,  but  it  will  be  the  focus  of  a  separate  hearing  that  will  ex-
pand on the Full Committee hearing we held earlier this year.

In  addition,  while  not  currently  part  of  the  Science  Mission  Directorate,  NASA’s
life and microgravity research programs are also important research endeavors that
will be scrutinized by this subcommittee in the coming months, particularly in light
of  the  deep—and  many  would  say  unwise—cuts  that  NASA  has  made  to  those  pro-
grams.

To  paraphrase  Dickens,  it  is  both  ‘‘the  best  of  times  and  the  worst  of  times’’  for
NASA’s space science programs. We have witnessed a whole series of exciting events
in  recent  months,  whether  it  be  the  discovery  of  possible  recent  liquid  water  flows
on  Mars,  stereo  images  of  solar  activity,  or  Nobel  prizes  awarded  for  research  en-
abled by NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer.

Those  are  just  a  few  of  the  accomplishments  of  NASA’s  space  science  enterprise
over the past several years. In short, NASA’s space science programs are highly pro-
ductive, exciting, and addressing compelling scientific questions.

That’s  the  good  news. . .what’s  the  bad  news?  The  bad  news  is  that  while  those
accomplishments  were  enabled  by  the  Nation’s  past  investments  in  NASA’s  science
activities, the outlook for the needed future investments is not good if present trends
are any indication.

For  example,  the  five-year  funding  plan  for  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate
has  been  reduced  by  a  total  of  $4  billion  since  Fiscal  Year  2005—a  significant  dis-
ruption.

In  addition,  the  impact  of  those  cuts  to  NASA’s  outyear  science  funding  is  mag-
nified by cost growth that has occurred within some science missions under develop-
ment—cost growth that is putting additional stress on the overall space science pro-
gram.

Another  example:  the  Explorer  program,  which  has  enabled  major  scientific  dis-

coveries, has seen new mission opportunities dramatically curtailed.

Funding for Research and Analysis, which helps to enable scientific research and
train  the  next  generation  of  scientists  and  engineers,  was  cut  by  an  average  of  15
percent in FY 2007.

Those  cuts  were  also  applied  retroactively  to  FY  2006  and  that  reduced  R&A

funding level was maintained in the FY 2008 request.

Moreover, that 15 percent R&A cut was an average cut, with some disciplines suf-

fering much deeper cuts.

panel today.

In short, at a time when NASA’s science programs offer the promise of major ad-
vances in our understanding of the sun, our solar system, and the universe beyond,
we risk doing long-term damage to the health of those programs if we are not care-
ful.

That  is  why  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  Dr.  Stern  and  the  rest  of  our  expert

We  need  to  get  their  best  assessment  of  the  challenges  facing  NASA’s  space
science program and the likely consequences of inaction, and most importantly, their
recommendations for addressing those challenges.

At  the  end  of  the  day,  however,  it  is  clear  to  me  that  if  we  are  going  to  ask  our
nation’s space science program to undertake challenging and meaningful initiatives,
we are going to need to provide the necessary resources.

In  closing,  I  again  want  to  welcome  our  witnesses,  and  I  now  yield  to  my  col-
league,  Ranking  Member  Calvert,  for  any  opening  remarks  he  would  like  to  make.
Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  would  like  to  thank
you  for  scheduling  today’s  hearing  on  NASA’s  space  science  pro-
gram, and my sincere thanks to our witnesses for taking time from
their busy schedules to join us this morning and share their views
and recommendations.

I  am  glad  our  Chairman  is  here  today.  He  was  out  running  this
morning  and  did  a  great  job,  that  is  why  he  is  a  little  sweaty  in
here, though the room is a little warm, Mr. Chairman. Let me just
point that out.

As  everyone  in  this  room  well  knows,  NASA  is  an  extraordinary
agency  that,  at  a  relatively  small  cost  to  the  taxpayer,  has  pro-
duced  science  discoveries  that  have  transformed  man’s  view  of  the
universe  around  us,  and  has  also  demonstrated  that  man  can  live
and  work  in  space.  The  pace  and  scope  of  science  discoveries  over
the last decade have been breathtaking. Dark energy, dark matter,
extra solar planets, evidence of water, as the Chairman mentioned,
on Mars, just to name a few.

Despite  the  fact  that  funding  for  NASA’s  science  mission  is
roughly 32 percent of the Agency’s budget, including Earth science,
hovering near a historical high relative to the overall Agency budg-
et,  the  tempo  of  new  discoveries  and  capabilities  that  we  recently
enjoyed  are  at  serious  risk  of  tapering  off  for  a  variety  of  well-un-
derstood reasons.

One, mission costs have far exceeded early projections.
Two, until Mike Griffin’s arrival as Administrator, NASA was de-
veloping  too  many  missions  for  the  resources  they  had  available,
forcing  the  Agency  to  stretch  out  schedules,  stay  within  budget,
and delaying the pace of new starts.

Three,  cost  uncertainties  of  launching  small  and  medium-sized
payloads  after  Delta  2  is  retired,  and  mission  assurance  and  ac-
counting changes.

Everyone in this room understands that severe budget challenges
are  also  confronting  NASA  in  its  manned  space  flight  and  aero-
nautics  research  programs,  forcing  the  Agency  to  remove  future
budget  growth  from  the  science  mission  directorate  in  order  to  ad-

18

dress  more  pressing  needs.  I  don’t  fault  NASA  for  making  the
tough choices it did, but it shouldn’t be that way.

I have stated before and I will say it again, that the Administra-
tion must provide NASA with realistic budget requests to match re-
sources  with  program  content,  otherwise,  the  balance  among
NASA’s  programs  becomes  imperiled  as  the  Agency  moves  re-
sources around to fund priorities and invites Congress—and this is
often not a good thing—to begin imposing its own preferences.

NASA Administrator Mike Griffin is doing an exceptional job, in
my opinion, leading the Agency. He has set priorities, and while ev-
erybody  in  this  room  may  not  agree  with  his  decisions,  he  has  not
attempted to be disingenuous or hasn’t disguised his decisions.

NASA’s  science  enterprise  leads  the  world  in  the  quest  for
human understanding of the cosmos, our solar system, and indeed,
our  home  planet.  The  strength  of  the  Agency’s  science  program  is
rooted  in  its  close  working  relationship  with  the  science  commu-
nity.  Our  witnesses  today  will  provide  us  with  the  best  guidance
on how NASA and Congress can address the challenges confronting
the  science  community  to  ensure  a  return  to  a  robust  mission
tempo  and  to  ensure  a  strong  cadre  of  scientists  and  engineers  to
propose and design future missions.

With  that,  Mr.  Chairman,  my  thanks,  and  again,  thanks  to  our

witnesses.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE KEN CALVERT

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  scheduling  today’s  hearing  on  NASA’s  Space
Science program, and my sincere thanks to our witnesses for taking time from their
busy schedules to join us this morning and share their views and recommendations.
As  everyone  in  this  room  well  knows,  NASA  is  an  extraordinary  agency  that  at
a  relatively  small  cost  to  the  taxpayer  has  produced  science  discoveries  that  have
transformed man’s view of the universe around us, and has also demonstrated that

relative  to  the  overall  agency  budget,  the  tempo  of  new  discoveries  and  capabilities
that  we’ve  recently  enjoyed  are  at  serious  risk  of  tapering  off  for  a  variety  of  well

Æ mission costs have far exceeded early projections;
Æ until Mike Griffin’s arrival as Administrator, NASA was developing too many
missions  for  the  resources  it  had  available,  forcing  the  Agency  to  stretch  out
schedules to stay within budget, and delaying the pace of new starts;

Everyone  in  this  room  understands  that  severe  budget  challenges  are  also  con-
fronting  NASA  in  its  manned  space  flight  and  aeronautics  research  programs,  forc-
ing the Agency to remove future budget growth from the science mission directorate

NASA Administrator Mike Griffin is doing an exceptional job leading the Agency.
He  has  set  priorities,  and  while  everyone  in  the  room  may  not  agree  with  his  deci-

a return to a robust mission tempo and ensure a strong cadre of scientists and engi-
neers to propose and design future missions.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and my thanks again to our witnesses.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Calvert.
I  want  to  do  a  little  housekeeping  at  this  point  before  we  begin
the testimony. If there are Members who wish to submit additional
opening  statements,  your  statements  will  be  added  to  the  record.
Without objection, so ordered.

In  addition,  we  would  also  like  to  include  a  statement  for  the
record  from  the  Planetary  Society  in  today’s  hearing.  Again,  with-
out objection, so ordered.

[The information follows:]

STATEMENT OF THE PLANETARY SOCIETY

Restoring the Vision

NASA  is  a  great  agency  achieving  great  things.  NASA  brings  out  the  best  in  us,
a society using some of its great wealth to help people around the globe understand
our  place  in  the  Universe  and  to  inspire  generations  of  explorers.  NASA’s  images,
its heroes, along with its scientific and engineering achievements, have changed the
world for all humankind. This statement criticizing both the proposed NASA budget
and current NASA operating plan is in support of space exploration and the process
of  scientific  discovery  and  engineering  achievement  that  NASA  represents  to  the
world.

The  Vision  for  Space  Exploration—which  is  supposed  to  be  guiding  NASA’s  pro-
gram  and  budget—has  become  distorted.  Its  mantra,  ‘‘go  as  you  pay,’’  has  become
‘‘go  as  you  cannibalize  other  programs.’’  Its  scientific  underpinnings  have  been  re-
moved, leaving it suspended with uncertain public support and public interest.

This  statement  of  The  Planetary  Society,  is  designed  to  represent  that  public  in-
terest.  The  Society  is  the  largest  public  space-interest  group  in  the  world,  a  non-
governmental organization that represents no particular profession, but instead rep-
resents  the  interest  of  citizens  who  believe  in  the  value  of  space  exploration  to  the
Nation and to the world.

The original Vision for Space Exploration’s first goal was ‘‘a sustained and afford-
able  human  and  robotic  program  to  explore  the  solar  system  and  beyond.’’  Instead,
the robotic program has been undercut and the solar system is nearly unmentioned
in the human program.

The original Vision for Space Exploration was to ‘‘Undertake lunar exploration ac-
tivities to enable sustained human and robotic exploration of Mars and more distant
destinations  in  the  solar  system.’’  Instead,  Mars  robotic  exploration  in  the  next  dec-
ade has been almost eliminated, and lunar exploration activities have been diverted
to constructing a permanent lunar base with macro-engineering projects in place of
exploration objectives.

The  original  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  directed  NASA  to  ‘‘Conduct  robotic  ex-
ploration of Mars to search for evidence of life, to understand the history of the solar
system,  and  to  prepare  for  future  human  exploration;  Conduct  robotic  exploration
across  the  solar  system  for  scientific  purposes  and  to  support  human  exploration.  In
particular, explore Jupiter’s moons, asteroids and other bodies to search for evidence
of life, to understand the history of the solar system, and to search for resources; and
Conduct  advanced  telescope  searches  for  Earth-like  planets  and  habitable  environ-
ments  around  other  stars.’’  Instead,  Mars  exploration  has  been  cut,  the  mission  to
Jupiter’s  moon  Europa  and  the  Terrestrial  Planet  Finder  mission  have  been  elimi-
nated, and the search for extraterrestrial life has been cut in half.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

20

Instead  of  ‘‘for  scientific  purposes,’’  the  program  has  seen  $3  billion  eliminated
from four years of space science planning, and science research and data analysis—
the  ‘‘seed  corn’’  that  allows  NASA  to  reap  future  benefits  from  its  exploration  pro-
grams—was cut 15 percent across the board.

These contradictions between the conduct of the NASA program and the originally
stated Vision for Space Exploration explain why The Planetary Society supports the
Vision  but  opposes  its  current  implementation  plan.  The  word  ‘‘exploration’’  has
been  hijacked  and  is  now  used  to  mean  human  space  vehicle  development,  instead
of missions and discoveries in the solar system.

Not only do we still support the Vision, we also support the NASA Administrator
in  his  incredibly  difficult  effort  to,  at  long  last,  redirect  human  space  flight  beyond
Earth  orbit.  Mike  Griffin  is  not  against  science,  but  he  has  been  given  too  few  re-
sources  and  too  many  constraints  to  properly  administer  either  the  Vision  or  space
science and exploration.

NASA  cannot  juggle  limited  resources  and  overburdening  constraints  without
dropping  a  few  balls.  NASA’s  budget  should  be  increased  as  was  originally  envi-
sioned,  and  as  this  committee  particularly  supported,  to  restore  the  Vision’s  sci-
entific  underpinnings  and  to  prepare  for  human  exploration  of  the  solar  system.  If
such  a  realistic  budget  increase  is  not  possible,  then  the  Vision’s  timetable  should
be  stretched.  In  fact  originally  the  Vision  was  said  to  have  no  timetable.  Most  of
the  current  dislocations  in  the  Vision’s  Constellation  program  are  being  driven  by
arbitrary dates having only political objectives. There is no national security or eco-
nomic driver that requires its current timetable.

‘‘Save Our Science’’ has become a rallying cry for The Planetary Society—we sub-
mitted  thousands  of  petitions  to  Congress  last  year,  and  thousands  more  to  the
President this year, from citizens asking to restore the science funding that was cut
from the NASA plan. Intellectually, science and exploration are inextricably linked,
but the ‘‘firewall’’ that once helped protect science needs to be restored.

We  fully  recognize  that  space  science  is  not  an  entitlement  program  and  that  it
can proceed at a slower pace. Our call to restore the scientific underpinnings to the
Vision and to NASA’s budget is not a statement of special interest for scientists. Too
often,  NASA  is  forced  to  make  decisions  in  order  to  bolster  one  or  another  part  of
its  work  force  because  of  some  special  interest.  Our  call  is  dominated  by  the  public
interest and by public support for the great ventures of space exploration—the ven-
tures  that  for  the  past  decade  brought  such  extraordinary  credit  and  support  for
NASA in the U.S. and around the world.

Consider  just  three  examples:  the  remarkable,  continuing  three-year  odyssey  of
the  Spirit  and  Opportunity  rovers  on  Mars;  the  complementary  discoveries  about
water  being  made  from  spacecraft  in  orbit  around  Mars;  and  the  thrilling  inter-
national  Cassini/Huygens  mission  in  the  Saturn  system.  The  fantastic  discoveries
from  these  explorations—the  watery  history  of  Mars  and  the  possibility  of  liquid
water on its surface today; water geysers in the Saturnian system; and hydrocarbon
lakes  on  Titan,  to  name  a  few—are  only  part  of  the  rewards  that  the  U.S.  has  ac-
crued.  The  adventures  of  roving  on  Mars,  probing  Titan,  and  voyages  through  the
solar  system  have  enthralled  the  public,  motivated  a  generation  of  students  and
their  teachers,  and  have  advanced  American  technology.  And,  of  course,  we  should
mention the Hubble Space Telescope and the Voyager probes. Their decades-long ex-
plorations  have  inspired  generations  of  students  to  strive  for  excellence,  and  yet
NASA was ready to abandon them both just a few years ago.

The FY 2007 budget damaged the future of NASA. Science missions were delayed
or canceled; technology funding was slashed, as was research funding—astrobiology,
in  particular.  The  slash  in  research  and  technology  funding  put  at  risk  the  ability
to develop future missions and to adequately analyze data from existing ones; it will
drive  many  young  people  from  the  field,  thereby  mortgaging  the  future  of  NASA
science and exploration.

Congress  recognized  these  problems  last  year,  the  FY  2007  Appropriations  Bill
passed by the House would have partially rectified these problems. The Senate was
also  working  to  correct  the  situation.  But  all  that  work  was  lost  when  no  budget
was  passed  last  year.  We  urgently  ask  you  to  support  restoration  for  some  of  the
losses in NASA science, technology, and flight missions.

There  is  one  additional  thing  that  you  could  do  to  help  open  the  box  in  which
NASA  has  been  placed—the  box  defined  by  too  much  politics  and  not  enough  re-
sources. That is international cooperation. Four nations, besides the U.S., are plan-
ning lunar missions: Japan and China this year, India next year, Russia soon after-
wards.  In  fact,  these  countries  are  not  just  sending  single  lunar  missions,  but  each
has  a  lunar  program  with  orbiters  to  be  followed  by  landers  and  rovers.  Europe  is
also planning lunar missions as part of its Aurora exploration program. For the U.S.

to  plan  a  lunar  base  completely  independent  of  these  missions  is  not  just  wasteful,
it lacks rationale. It lacks vision.

The Planetary Society has called for an International Lunar Decade in which the
space-faring  nations  of  the  world  can  cooperate  to  advance  their  exploration  objec-
tives,  and  in  which  the  developing  world  can  share  in  the  benefits  of  space  science
and  exploration.  The  U.S.  could  return  to  its  original  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,
looking  forward  to  Mars.  We  have  already  landed  humans  on  the  Moon.  We  can
work  with  other  nations  as  they  now  reach  for  the  Moon,  and  in  that  way,  build
a  rationale  that  serves  more  than  just  a  space  program,  but  global  cooperation  as
well.

This  statement  has  focused  on  exploration,  the  goal  enunciated  in  the  Vision  for
Space  Exploration  to  extend  human  presence  into  the  solar  system.  More  specifi-
cally,  we  have  focused  on  the  planets.  That  isn’t  too  surprising—we  are  after  all,
The  Planetary  Society.  However,  we  were  founded  on  the  premise  that  one  of  the
chief  goals  of  planetary  exploration  is  to  learn  about  ourselves,  and  about  our  own
planet.  The  very  first  observations  and  models  of  global  climate  change  came  from
planetary missions to Venus, and then later, to Mars. The most basic scientific work
of  our  co-founders  Carl  Sagan  and  Bruce  Murray  was  about  comparative  plane-
tology, studying other worlds to understand the processes at work on our own plan-
et.  Never  in  our  history  has  understanding  the  Earth  been  so  important.  Congress
should,  along  with  addressing  all  other  science  concerns,  restore  the  programs  and
missions in NASA to observe the Earth.

This  past  year,  NASA  dropped  ‘‘understanding  the  Earth’’  from  its  mission  state-
ment.  The  Planetary  Society  picked  it  up,  and  added  it  to  our  own  mission  state-
ment.1 But  we  cannot  pick  up  the  budget  for  the  planetary  and  Earth  science  that
has  been  cut  from  the  NASA  budget.  Congress  must  do  that.  We  urge  Congress  to
help NASA achieve the goals articulated in the Vision for Space Exploration, for the
benefit  of  our  future,  and  our  children’s  future.  Save  our  future;  Save  Our  Science.

STATEMENT OF J. CRAIG WHEELER

PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on NASA’s 2008 science budget from my

perspective as President of the American Astronomical Society (AAS).

The  AAS  believes  that  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  (SMD)  should
be part of the American Innovation Agenda, which seeks to bolster funding
for  the  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF),  the  Department  of  Energy’s
(DOE) Office of Science, and the National Institute for Standards and Tech-
nology  (NIST).  These  agencies  have  been  identified  as  vital  to  America’s
leadership  in  innovation,  by  training  a  highly-skilled  workforce  and  fos-
tering the discovery and development of new ideas. NASA Science is a part-
ner  in  these  endeavors.  Specifically,  we  advocate  for  increasing  NASA
SMD’s  FY  2008  budget  to  $5.566  billion,  which  is  six  percent  over  the  final
FY  2007  amount  and  a  modest  increase  over  the  President’s  FY  2008  re-
quest.

The  AAS  is  the  major  organization  of  professional  astronomers  in  the  United
States. The basic objective of the AAS is to promote the advancement of astronomy
and closely related branches of science. The membership, numbering approximately
7000, includes physicists, mathematicians, geologists, and engineers whose interests
lie within the broad spectrum of modern astronomy. AAS members advise NASA on
scientific  priorities,  participate  in  NASA  missions,  and  use  the  data  from  NASA’s
outstanding  scientific  discoveries  to  build  a  coherent  picture  for  the  origin  and  evo-
lution of the Earth, the solar system, our Galaxy, and the Universe as a whole.

In  the  recent  past,  the  astronomical  community,  working  together  with  NASA,
has  produced  a  remarkable  string  of  successes  that  have  changed  our  basic  picture
of  the  Universe.  Observations  with  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  (HST)  of  exploding
stars whose light has been traveling for half the age of the Universe, combined with
the  exquisite  map  of  the  glow  from  the  Big  Bang  itself  from  the  Wilkinson  Micro-
wave  Anisotropy  Probe  and  information  from  other  observatories,  shows  that  the
Universe we live in is not the Universe we see. Mysterious Dark Matter makes the
ordinary particles clump together to form stars and galaxies. Even more mysterious
Dark Energy makes the expansion of the Universe speed up. Both of these concepts
challenge our understanding of the nature of matter and energy in the Universe and

elsewhere.

open up broad new vistas for future work. An ambitious set of Great Observatories,
now  including  Spitzer  in  the  infrared  and  Chandra  at  X-ray  wavelengths,  is  hard
at work, enriching our understanding of how the Universe works.

Similarly,  exploration  of  the  solar  system  has  been  a  resounding  success  for
NASA, with exciting missions to Mars and to Saturn revealing a beautiful and intri-
cate  history  that  is  interwoven  with  the  history  of  our  planet  Earth.  The  discovery
of  planets  around  other  stars  has  been  a  great  triumph  of  the  past  decade,  raising
hopes for seeing planets like our own Earth, and placing our own solar system, and
life itself, in a new context.

NASA’s  key  role  in  these  discoveries  makes  its  science  program  of  deep  interest
to  AAS  members.  In  the  past,  NASA  has  worked  with  the  astronomical  community
to find the most promising paths forward. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
is  a  large  program  that  was  endorsed  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)
Decadal  Survey  in  astronomy.  When  completed  in  the  next  decade,  it  will  help  ex-
pand  the  frontier  of  knowledge  to  the  deepest  reaches  of  space  and  time  and  into
the hidden places where stars and planets are formed. The astronomical community
also  recommended,  and  NASA  plans  to  execute,  a  wide  range  of  other  programs—
some of moderate scope and others that nourish the infrastructure for a healthy and
vibrant community. This balanced approach has proved best—with a range of oppor-
tunities carefully crafted to get the best science from NASA’s Science budget.

Recognizing the current challenging budget climate, in which federal non-security,
discretionary  spending  is  declining  by  about  one  percent,  the  current  NASA  budget
for  science  is  nonetheless  cause  for  concern.  The  continuing  resolution  (CR),  now
Public  Law  110–005,  provided  funding  for  many  federal  agencies  including  NASA
for  FY  2007.  NASA  Science  has  suffered  a  $78.8  million  shortfall  from  the  Presi-
dent’s  FY  2007  request.  The  President’s  FY  2008  budget  request  represents  a  0.9
percent increase in NASA Science spending over the FY 2007 request; however, with
inflation  currently  around  two  percent,  the  FY  2008  request  still  represents  a  de-
cline in real dollars available for research in science compared to the President’s FY
2007  request.  A  key  question  is  what  will  become  the  new  baseline  for  NASA
Science  funding,  the  FY  2007  request  or  the  CR.  If  the  CR  is  adopted  as  the  new
baseline,  this  could  represent  a  loss  to  NASA  Science  in  the  outyears  of  $1  billion
or more.

The AAS therefore recommends that Congress increase the FY 2008 budg-
et  for  NASA  Science  by  six  percent  over  the  CR  level.  This  modest  increase
over the President’s FY 2008 request will help maintain balance within the science
portfolio,  which  is  critical  to  our  community.  It  is  important  to  support  small  mis-
sions and research grants to individual investigators. Otherwise, many exciting pro-
grams to explore the solar system, to detect planets around other stars, to measure
gravitational  waves  from  astronomical  events,  to  explore  black  holes  in  all  their
manifestations,  and  to  seek  the  nature  of  the  dark  energy  may  be  threatened.  In
particular,  we  advocate  for  restoring  funding  to  the  Explorer  program  and  pro-
tecting the Beyond Einstein mission.

We  further  advocate  that  NASA  Science  should  be  part  of  the  American
innovation  agenda.  Maintaining  and  strengthening  American  innovation  in
science  and  technology  has  broad  bipartisan  support,  both  in  Congress  and  the  Ad-
ministration.  Our  recommended  increase  of  six  percent  in  NASA  Science  is  smaller
than  the  increases  proposed  for  the  science  component  of  other  agencies  identified
as  strategically  important  for  innovation.  These  include  an  8.7  percent  increase  for
NSF, a 16 percent increase for Department of Energy’s Office of Science, and nearly
21  percent  for  NIST  (all  increases  over  the  CR  levels).  For  AAS  members,  the  cuts
in  NASA’s  support  for  science  threaten  to  offset  or  overwhelm  the  increases  that
have  been  aimed  at  improving  America’s  innovation  through  the  NSF,  DOE,  and
NIST.  A  real  effort  to  improve  science  and  engineering  in  the  U.S.  should  treat
NASA’s  science  program  as  part  of  the  solution.  NASA’s  science  missions  inspire
new  generations  of  young  people  to  pursue  careers  in  science,  engineering,  and
mathematics and train these students and young scientists to become the innovators
of the future.

Finally, the AAS applauds the Administration and Congress for upholding the pri-
orities  of  the  NAS  Decadal  Survey  in  astronomy.  We  are  pleased  that  the  develop-
ment  of  JWST  and  HST  servicing  mission  are  priorities  in  the  new  budget,  but  we
stress that balance is critical in the Science portfolio.

NASA Science has been and continues to be a beacon of innovation and discovery
by  inspiring  generations  of  young  people,  capturing  the  imagination  of  the  public,
developing  new  technologies,  and  discovering  profound  insights  into  the  nature  of
our Universe.

The  AAS  and  its  members  are  prepared  to  work  with  Congress  and  with  NASA
to help find the best way forward. We will give you our best advice and we will work
diligently to make the most of NASA’s investment in science.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  presence  of
Eddie Bernice Johnson, Congresswoman Johnson. She is a Member
of the Full Committee, and she is here today with us. Also, I would
like to acknowledge, Dr. Stern, with your forbearance, an esteemed
and highly accomplished American, Dr. John Mather, who is a win-
ner  of  the  Nobel  Prize  and  the  new  NASA  chief  scientist,  so  Dr.
Mather, we are honored to have you here as well.

At  this  time,  I  would  like  to  introduce  our  panel  of  witnesses,
and  I  will  go  across  and  introduce  each  one  of  you,  and  then  we
will come back and start with Dr. Stern.

As  I  mentioned  earlier,  we  have  a  constituent,  a  friend  of  mine,
Dr. Alan Stern, who in addition to serving as the principal investi-
gator  on  NASA’s  New  Horizons  mission  to  Pluto,  has  now  become
the  new  Associate  Administrator  of  NASA’s  science  mission  direc-
torate.

Next to him is Dr. Lennard Fisk, who is the Thomas M. Donahue
distinguished Professor of Space Science at the University of Michi-
gan,  currently  serving  as  the  Chairman  of  the  National  Research
Council Space Studies Board.

Next  to  him  is  Dr.  Garth  Illingworth,  who  is  a  Professor  of  As-
tronomy  and  Astrophysics  at  the  University  of  California,  Santa
Cruz, and is the Chair of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory
Committee.

Dr. Daniel Baker, who I mentioned earlier, is Professor of Astro-
physical and Planetary Sciences and Director for the Laboratory for
Atmospheric  and  Space  Physics,  fondly  known  as  LASP,  and  it  is
located in my home district at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Finally,  we  have  Dr.  Joseph  Burns  who  is  the  Irving  Porter
Church  Professor  of  Engineering  and  Professor  of  Astronomy,  and
currently  serves  as  Vice  Provost  for  Physical  Sciences  and  Engi-
neering at Cornell.

Again,  welcome  to  all  of  you.  We  really  are  appreciative  of  you

taking time today.

You  will  each,  as  I  think  you  know,  have  five  minutes  for  your
opening  remarks,  and  after  which  the  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee  or  Members  of  the  Full  Committee,  as  it  may  be,  will
have five minutes to ask questions.

Dr. Stern, the floor is yours. Welcome.

STATEMENT OF DR. S. ALAN STERN, ASSOCIATE

ADMINISTRATOR, NASA SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE
Dr. STERN. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Udall, Ranking
Member  Calvert,  Congresswoman  Johnson.  I  appreciate  the  oppor-
tunity to appear before you today.

I am excited and humbled by the task I assumed four weeks ago,
leading NASA’s Space Science Mission Directorate, the world’s pre-
miere space and Earth science effort, without doubt.

The  President’s  budget  for  NASA  fiscal  year  2008  provides  $5.4
billion  for  science  in  that  year  alone.  This  allows  us  to  operate  a
fleet of 52 orbital and interplanetary missions while simultaneously
developing another 41 new missions for launch over the next seven

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

24

years.  That  is  an  impressive  total,  93  space  missions  in  develop-
ment or flight.

Within  this  budget,  we  also  support  a  modest  sub-orbital  re-
search  program,  and  more  than  3,000  scientist-led  research
projects across the entire spectrum of Earth and space sciences.

More  complete  details  of  NASA’s  fiscal  year  2008  science  budget
request are included in my written testimony, but you asked me to
comment on how I see my role at NASA, and I want to turn heads
while  I  am  here.  I  want  to  produce  landmark  scientific  achieve-
ments  and  to  make  my  Directorate  and  its  various  projects  run
more efficiently and stay within their cost boundaries. I see this as
a requirement for my being an agent for change.

I  want  to  highlight  two  examples  of  change  that  have  already
taken  place  since  I  began  work  at  NASA  four  weeks  ago.  The  first
is  the  establishment  of  an  Office  of  Chief  Scientist,  or  OCS.  This
office will provide an independent technical analysis and advice re-
garding  scientific  matters  within  our  portfolio,  particularly  on
issues  of  prioritization  within  and  between  each  of  the  four  sci-
entific  disciplines.  As  I  said,  we  opened  this  office  on  my  first  day
at NASA, and it is a signal of our renewed commitment to scientific
excellence.  OCS  is  led  by  one  of  the  most  impressive  and  experi-
enced  space  scientists  in  the  United  States,  cosmologist  and  2006
Nobel  Laureate  Dr.  John  Mather  from  NASA’s  Goddard  Space
Flight Center. John is with us here today, and he is ably supported
by  two  deputies,  one  for  Earth  sciences  and  one  for  the  space
sciences.

I have also created a position called a senior advisor for research
analysis  within  the  leadership  of  the  Directorate,  and  I  have  ap-
pointed Dr. Yvonne Pendleton to that position. She is also here just
behind me. Yvonne? Dr. Pendleton was formerly the Space Science
and  Astrobiology  Division  Chief  at  NASA’s  Ames  Research  Center
where  she  set  an  outstanding  record  about  science  program  man-
agement  and  achievement.  Dr.  Pendleton  is  charged  with  guiding
our  research  and  analysis  program  and  making  recommendations
for  ways  that  we  can  both  improve  the  processes  and  the  content
of  our  core  research  and  analysis  effort.  This  really  is  a  core  part
of our entire science. Never before has NASA’s scientific leadership
included  a  position  focused  solely  on  improving  our  research  and
analysis programs.

Now,  let  me  turn  to  the  four  specific  questions  you  asked  of  me.
The first question asked about my top goals, I have three, and they
are  first,  to  make  stronger  progress  at  all  four  of  the  Decadal  sur-
veys.  Secondly,  to  get  more  from  our  existing  and  planned  budget,
and third, to help the Division for Space Exploration succeed.

Your second question concerning the top three management risks
as  I  see  them,  these  are  the  cost  of  launches  to  space  for  science
missions,  cost  growth  in  science  mission  development,  and  the
sometimes  immature  cost  realism  and  the  resulting  unrealistic  ex-
pectations that have been set by some recent Decadal surveys.

Your third question concerned how we will prioritize and balance
our objectives across the portfolio. The answer is that we must bal-
ance  with  four  considerations:  science  impact,  affordability,  devel-
opment  risk,  and  technological  readiness.  I  have  chartered  Chief
Scientist  Mather  to  make  a  fair  and  deterministic  process  that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

25

takes these four factors into account to balance our priorities with-
in each portfolio element and between the four portfolios.

The  final  question  concerns  strategic  investments  that  I  would
like  to  make.  These  will  be  in  three  areas:  research  and  analysis,
data analysis from space flight missions, and sub-orbital programs.
To say a little bit more specifically, I want to make scientists more
efficient  and  productive  and  increase  the  funding  to  research  and
analysis  so  we  can  better  achieve  our  research  objectives.  Regard-
ing  data  analysis,  an  increase  in  data  analysis  would  provide  the
taxpayers  and  decision-makers  like  yourself  with  an  enhanced
value for the investments that we make in the missions to actually
get  the  goods  out  at  the  other  end,  to  the  analysis  and  make  the
discoveries after the data is collected.

Finally,  regarding  sub-orbital  programs,  using  rockets  and  high
altitude  balloons,  I  intend  to  provide  opportunities  to  train  space
scientists  in  the  art  of  space  flight,  to  bridge  the  2010  to  2012
desert  in  orbital  and  planetary  mission  launches,  and  to  provide
opportunities 
for  technology  development  and  demonstration
through this sub-orbital program.

I will close now by thanking you again for inviting me, and I look
forward  to  answering  your  questions  and  working  with  you  in  the
future.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Stern follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF S. ALAN STERN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity
to appear today as the new Associate Administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Di-
rectorate  (SMD).  The  four  weeks  I  have  spent  on  the  job  at  NASA  Headquarters
have  been  personally  rewarding,  and  I  look  forward  to  continuing  that  experience
in appearing before the Subcommittee today to discuss NASA’s plans for the future
of  SMD’s  space—and  Earth—science  portfolio,  as  represented  in  the  President’s  FY
2008  budget  request  for  NASA,  and  to  highlight  my  vision  for  this  organization.  I
appreciate this opportunity to address your questions and concerns.

First,  permit  me  to  note  that  although  my  scientific  background  and  expertise  is
in astrophysics and planetary science, I serve as the Associate Administrator for all
four  of  our  Earth  and  space  science  disciplines,  and  that  I  look  forward  to  learning
more about Earth Science and Heliophysics in order to further advance these impor-
tant programs in SMD’s science portfolio.

The  President’s  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  calls  upon  NASA  to  conduct  robotic
and human exploration of the Moon, Mars and other destinations, to conduct robotic
exploration across the solar system, and to conduct advanced telescope searches for
Earth-like  planets  around  other  stars.  Other  Presidential  directives  and  legislative
mandates  instruct  NASA  to  conduct  Earth  observation  and  scientific  research  and
to explore the origin and destiny of the universe. With enactment of the NASA Au-
thorization  Act  of  2005  (P.L.  109–155),  the  Congress  provided  a  fresh  legislative
mandate for this charge, calling for a balanced program of science, exploration, and
aeronautics.

I  am  committed  to  implementing  this  direction,  and  bringing  to  NASA  and  the
Congress the best possible slate of programs and program success within the signifi-
cant  resources  already  available.  This  includes  programs  synergistic  with  NASA’s
Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate  and  also  research  that  both  enables,  and
is  enabled  by,  human  exploration  plans  for  the  Moon  and  Mars.  I  am  an  enthusi-
astic advocate of human exploration and believe that a strong science program asso-
ciated  with  this  exploration  is  important  to  maximizing  the  benefits  to  the  Nation
of such human exploration.
Vision for SMD

Before  I  outline  the  recent  scientific  achievements  of  NASA’s  space  science  pro-
gram  and  the  President’s  request  to  further  advance  that  program  in  FY  2008,  I
would like to share with the Subcommittee several guiding principles I am instilling
in  SMD,  as  well  as  an  important  change  to  the  way  matters  of  scientific
prioritization are analyzed and debated within SMD.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

26

Below are my three guiding principles for SMD, each is extremely important and

of equal priority:

1. To  make  strong  progress  advancing  the  priorities  of  all  four  decadal  sur-

veys1, for example by increasing our international collaboration efforts;

2. To  get  more  from  our  existing  and  planned  budgets,  for  example  by  better
managing  flight  missions  and  by  ensuring  that  data  analysis  from  missions
is sufficiently funded to ‘‘get the promised goods out;’’ and

3. To  help  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  succeed,  for  example  by  fostering

a lunar science community.

As stated above, I also have made an important change to the way matters of sci-
entific  prioritization  are  analyzed  and  debated  within  SMD.  That  change  is  both  to
our  processes  and  to  our  senior  leadership  in  SMD.  On  my  first  day  with  NASA,
one  month  ago  today,  I  established  a  new  office,  the  Office  of  the  Chief  Scientist
(OCS),  reporting  directly  to  me  as  the  Associate  Administrator  for  SMD.  The  pri-
mary function of this new office is to provide independent technical analysis and ad-
vice  regarding  scientific  matters  in  the  SMD  portfolio.  In  particular,  this  includes
issues  of  prioritization  both  within,  and  between,  each  of  the  four  scientific  dis-
ciplines  in  SMD’s  portfolio.  Previously,  no  strong,  formal,  independent  advice  func-
tion  was  in  place.  To  ensure  the  highest  quality  of  advice,  I  asked  cosmologist  and
Nobel Laureate Dr. John Mather to lead this effort as the SMD Chief Scientist, and
he has accepted. John is ably supported by two deputy Chief Scientists, one for the
Earth  Sciences  and  one  for  the  Space  Sciences.  I  believe  Dr.  Mather  and  his  team,
coupled with the strong role they are chartered to play in mission prioritization, se-
lection,  and  science  management  decisions,  will  produce  increasing  benefits  as  we
go forward.
Scientific Achievements

Now  I  will  turn  to  some  of  the  recent  scientific  achievements  of  NASA’s  science

program.

I am proud to be leading a world-class effort that consistently returns historic sci-
entific  results.  This  past  year  alone  was  truly  remarkable  for  scientific  discovery
about  our  Earth,  the  Sun,  our  solar  system,  and  the  universe.  This  is  exemplified
in part by the fact that NASA alone was responsible for 11 percent of Science News
magazine’s  top  stories—covering  all  fields  of  science—for  2006;  this  is  an  all-time
record in the 34 years that this metric has been tracked.

Important  findings  resulting  from  our  program  ranged  from  new  observations  of
familiar  phenomena  like  the  ozone  hole,  hurricanes,  and  rainfall,  to  the  discovery
of lakes of organic hydrocarbons on Saturn’s planet-sized moon Titan, to the identi-
fication  of  new  classes  of  planetary  abodes  across  our  galaxy,  to  the  study  of  the
Sun’s  magnetic  field,  showing  it  to  be  more  turbulent  and  dynamic  than  previously
expected.

As  these  and  other  results  about  our  world  and  the  universe  pour  in,  NASA  also
continues  to  develop  and  launch  our  next  generation  of  missions,  and  to  support  a
vigorous  scientific  community  via  research  and  data  analysis  funding.  In  total,  I
note,  NASA  currently  is  developing  or  flying  a  total  of  93  space  and  Earth  science
missions—far  more  than  all  of  the  other  space  agencies  of  the  world  combined.
NASA also supports over 3,000 separate space and Earth science research investiga-
tions in our Research and Analysis programs, spending approximately $600 million
annually on scientific data analysis, modeling, and theory across the four disciplines
of Earth and space science spanned by SMD.

I  intend  for  SMD  to  continue  to  turn  heads  across  the  world  by  developing  space
missions  and  supporting  scientific  research  that  rewrites  textbooks  in  all  of  our
science disciplines.

At present, NASA is operating 52 space and Earth science missions and, simulta-
neously,  developing  41  new  flight  missions.  These  new  missions  range  from  modest
Principal Investigator-led efforts like the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) cur-
rently planned for launch in 2008 and the Phoenix Mars lander about to launch this
summer,  to  the  flagship  NASA  space  science  missions  like  the  James  Webb  Space
Telescope (JWST) mission in development for launch in 2013.

In 2006, NASA launched four new science and technology demonstration missions:
New  Horizons,  Solar  Terrestrial  Relations  Observatories  (STEREO),  CloudSat,  and

1 The  term  ‘‘decadal  survey’’  refers  to  a  regular  series  of  reports  conducted  by  the  National
Research  Council  of  the  National  Academies  on  behalf  of  NASA  and  its  partner  agencies.  Each
of  SMD’s  science  disciplines  has  its  own  decadal  survey,  representing  community  consensus  in
each  field.  These  surveys  assess  proposed  activities  and  recommend  investment  priorities  over
a ten-year timeframe.

agencies  to  launch  five  other  science  and  technology  missions:  Cloud-Aerosol  Lidar
and  Infrared  Pathfinder  Satellite  Observations  (CALIPSO),  Two  Wide-Angle  Imag-
ing  Neutral-Atom  Spectrometers  (TWINS)–A,  Hinode  (Solar-B),  ST–6,  and  the
NOAA  GOES–N  satellite.  Below  Is  more  detail  on  this  impressive  list  of  newly
launched missions.

In  January  2006,  NASA  launched  the  New  Horizons  mission  to  the  planet  Pluto
and the ancient Kuiper Belt in which it orbits. New Horizons, the fastest spacecraft
ever  launched,  will  begin  its  reconnaissance  of  these  bodies  eight  years  hence,  in
2015, following a three billion-plus mile crossing of our planetary system. I am very
proud  to  have  been  since  its  inception,  and  to  continue  to  be,  the  Principal  Investi-
gator  of  this  mission.  Just  13  months  after  launch,  this  February,  New  Horizons
flew by Jupiter, making important new observations of a wide variety of exotic phe-
nomena  in  the  Jupiter  system,  including,  for  example,  the  eruption  of  the  gar-
gantuan Tvashtar volcano on Jupiter’s moon, Io.

Following  on  the  launch  of  New  Horizons  with  the  April  2006  launch  of  the
CloudSat  and  CALIPSO  spacecraft,  NASA  added  two  important  assets  to  the  ‘‘A-
train’’  of  satellites  flying  in  close  proximity  polar  orbits  around  the  Earth  to  gain
a better understanding of key factors related to climate change.

NASA  has  also  been  very  active  this  past  year  launching  new  heliophysics  mis-
sions. The agency collaborated on the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s new
Hinode  (Solar-B)  mission,  which  was  successfully  launched  in  September  2006.
Early  results  have  already  provided  new  insight  on  solar  magnetic  processes  oper-
ating in the Sun’s atmosphere.

Then  in  October  2006,  NASA’s  twin  STEREO  spacecraft  were  launched  to  help
researchers  construct  the  first-ever  three-dimensional  views  of  the  Sun’s  atmos-
phere.  This  new  view  will  improve  our  abilities  in  space  weather  forecasting  and
greatly advance the ability of scientists to understand solar physics, which, in turn,
enables us to better protect humans living and working in space.

Already  this  year,  on  February  17,  we  launched  all  five  THEMIS  (Time  History
of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) microsatellites on a single
rocket  to  study  the  genesis  of  Earth’s  aurora.  On  April  25,  the  Aeronomy  of  Ice  in
the Mesosphere (AIM) mission was launched to study ice clouds in the polar regions
of Earth’s upper atmosphere. We also remain on track to launch both the Dawn mis-
sion to explore fascinating and important Ceres and Vesta in the main belt of aster-
oids between Mars and Jupiter, and also the Phoenix Mars lander by late this sum-
mer.

From  across  the  solar  system,  NASA’s  spacecraft  have  provided  startling  new  in-
sights into the formation and evolution of the planets. Images from the Mars Global
Surveyor  have  revealed  recent  deposits  in  gullies  on  Mars,  evidence  that  suggests
water  may  have  flowed  in  these  locations  within  the  last  several  years.  The  Mars
Reconnaissance  Orbiter,  which  began  its  primary  science  phase  in  November  2006,
has  not  only  taken  extraordinary  high  resolution  images  of  Mars  at  resolutions
greater  than  any  other  mission  to-date,  but  has  taken  incredible  images  of  Oppor-
tunity and Spirit on the surface, and helped the Phoenix lander find a safe landing
area.  From  its  orbit  around  Saturn,  the  Cassini  spacecraft  recently  found  unex-
pected evidence of liquid water geysers erupting from near-surface water reservoirs
on Saturn’s moon, Enceladus.

Additionally,  the  Wilkinson  Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP)  Explorer  mis-
sion  was  able  to  gather  new  information  about  the  first  second  after  the  universe
formed,  while  the  Chandra  X-ray  Observatory  provided  new  and  strong  evidence  of
dark matter, and the Hubble Space Telescope identified 16 candidate planets orbit-
ing other stars near the center of our galaxy.

In  late  October  2006,  NASA  Administrator  Mike  Griffin  announced  plans  for  a
fifth and final Space Shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
to extend and dramatically improve its capabilities for the future. The repaired and
revitalized  HST  will  boast  two  new  major  scientific  instruments  with  capabilities
that will make it 10 times more powerful than the HST we have today.

In  Earth  Science,  researchers  are  using  Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mission
(TRMM) data to provide a complete picture of low-latitude precipitation and storms
around  the  entire  world;  in  2006,  researchers  used  eight  years  of  continuous  data
from the TRMM lightning Imaging Sensor to identify the regions on Earth that typi-
cally experience the most intense thunderstorms.

Using instruments flying closer to Earth, NASA investigators flew 29 separate sci-
entific  instruments  to  60,000  foot  altitudes  aboard  NASA’s  WB–57F  Canberra  air-
craft  in  the  Costa  Rica  Aura  Validation  Experiment  (CAVE).  These  airborne  meas-
urements, coupled with measurements from the orbiting Aura spacecraft, shed light
on  how  ozone-destroying  chemicals  get  into  the  stratosphere  over  the  tropics  and

how  high-altitude  clouds  affect  the  flow  of  water  vapor—a  powerful  greenhouse
gas—in this critical region of the atmosphere.

Additionally,  scientists  using  nearly  a  decade  of  global  ocean  satellite  data  were
able  to  demonstrate  a  strong  relationship  between  warming  climate  and  a  decline
in  the  microscopic  marine  plant  life  (phytoplankton)  at  the  base  of  the  marine  eco-
system.

Examples  of  important  successes  in  our  data  analysis  programs  are  also  diverse.
Astronomers  combining  data  from  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  with  data  from
ground-based  and  other  space-based  telescopes  have  created  the  first  three-dimen-
sional map of the large-scale distribution of dark matter in the universe. NASA re-
searchers  also  found  organic  materials  that  formed  in  the  most  distant  regions  of
the  early  solar  system  preserved  in  a  unique  meteorite  that  fell  over  Canada  in
2000. And, using a network of small automated telescopes, astronomers have discov-
ered  a  planet  orbiting  in  a  binary  star  system,  showing  that  planet  formation  very
likely  occurs  in  most  star  systems.  In  our  home  solar  system,  scientists  predicted
that  the  next  solar  activity  cycle  will  be  30–50  percent  stronger  than  the  previous
one  and  up  to  a  year  late.  Accurately  predicting  the  Sun’s  cycles  will  help  plan  for
the  effects  of  solar  storms  and  help  protect  future  astronauts.  And  a  breakthrough
‘‘solar  climate’’  forecast  was  made  with  a  combination  of  computer  simulation  and
groundbreaking  observations  of  the  solar  interior  from  space  using  the  NASA/ESA
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).

The list of achievements resulting from NASA’s space and Earth science portfolio
is much longer than these examples alone. I am excited to tell you that lack of time
here today rather than lack of results, causes me to have to move on from this topic
to discuss the President’s FY 2008 budget request for space science.
Highlights of the Science Mission Directorate’s FY 2008 Budget Request

NASA’s  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  Agency’s  science  portfolio  is  $5.5  billion.
This  represents  an  increase  of  $49.3  million  (or  one  percent)  over  the  FY  2007  re-
quest,  adjusted  for  NASA’s  new,  simplified  full  cost  accounting  system.  It  will  en-
able  NASA  to  launch  or  partner  on  10  new  missions,  operate  and  provide  ground
support  for  more  than  50  spacecraft,  and  fund  a  wide  array  of  scientific  research
related to and based on the data returned from these missions.

The Planetary Science budget request of $1.4 billion will advance scientific knowl-
edge of the solar system, search for evidence of extraterrestrial life, and prepare for
human  exploration  of  the  Moon  and  Mars.  NASA  will  get  an  early  start  on  Lunar
science  when  the  Discovery  Program’s  Moon  Mineralogy  Mapper  (M3)  launches
aboard India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission in March 2008. Also aboard this mission will
be  Mini-RF,  a  technology  demonstration  payload,  supported  by  NASA’s  Exploration
Systems  and  Space  Operations  Mission  Directorates  which  may  glean  evidence  for
water  in  the  Moon’s  polar  regions.  In  support  of  expanded  opportunities  for  pur-
suing  lunar  science,  the  President’s  request  includes  $351  million  from  FY  2008–
2012  for  a  Lunar  Science  Research  budget  line  within  the  Planetary  Science  Divi-
sion. The Science Mission Directorate is already hard at work creating synergy with
the  programs  of  the  Exploration  Systems  Mission  Directorate.  After  the  Lunar  Re-
connaissance  Orbiter  completes  its  prime  mission  for  the  Exploration  Systems  Mis-
sion Directorate, the Science Mission Directorate plans to fund extended mission op-
erations  through  this  budget  line  in  order  to  maximize  scientific  return  from  the
spacecraft. In addition, the new Lunar Science Research Initiative includes Missions
of  Opportunity,  technology  development,  data  archiving,  and  expanded  basic  lunar
research. The Discovery and New Frontiers programs also provide opportunities for
the  science  community  to  propose  missions  to  accomplish  lunar  science  investiga-
tions,  and  one  such  mission  is  under  study.  We  have  tasked  the  National  Research
Council (NRC) to conduct a study on the scientific context for the exploration of the
Moon.  Their  preliminary  report  is  in  hand,  and  their  final  report  is  due  this  sum-
mer. That report will help us mature our lunar science plans in the months ahead.
We  have  also  begun  similar  coordinating  steps  for  Mars,  where  SMD  already  has
a mature and robust program of scientific exploration.

The  FY  2008  budget  also  supports  the  Mars  Exploration  Program  by  operating
five  spacecraft  at  Mars,  flying  the  Phoenix  lander,  scheduled  for  launch  in  August
2007, and continuing to develop the Mars Science Laboratory for a launch scheduled
in  2009.  The  Discovery  Program’s  Dawn  Mission  dual  asteroid  orbiter  will  be  oper-
ating  en  route  to  the  asteroid  belt,  and  the  Mercury  Surface,  Space  Environment,
Geochemistry  and  Ranging  (MESSENGER)  spacecraft  will  make  its  first  flyby  of
Mercury. Last year, three Discovery mission proposals and three Discovery Missions
of Opportunity were selected for Phase A studies which will culminate late this year
in  new  mission  and  instrument  selections.  The  Discovery  Program  plans  to  again
invite  proposals  for  additional  new  missions  in  2008.  Additionally,  the  New  Fron-

tiers  Program’s  Juno  Mission  will  undergo  both  a  Preliminary  Design  Review  and
a Non-Advocate Review in FY 2008 in preparation for entering development towards
a  2011  launch  to  study  Jupiter’s  interior,  aurora,  and  magnetosphere.  Like  Dis-
covery, the New Frontiers Program plans to release a new Announcement of Oppor-
tunity (AO) in 2008.

The  Heliophysics  budget  request  of  $1.1  billion  will  support  14  operational  mis-
sions  and  six  missions  in  development  to  better  characterize  and  understand  the
Sun  and  its  effects  on  Earth,  the  solar  system,  and  space  environmental  conditions
that will be experienced by astronauts, and to demonstrate technologies that can im-
prove  future  operational  systems.  Additionally,  during  FY  2008,  the  Explorer  Pro-
gram  will  launch  both  the  Interstellar  Boundary  Explorer  (IBEX)  mission,  focused
on the detection of the very edge of our solar system’s heliosphere and the Coupled
Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation (CINDI) Mission of Opportunity. The Solar Dy-
namics  Observatory  (SDO)  to  study  the  Sun’s  magnetic  field  is  also  scheduled  for
launch  in  late  2008  or  early  2009.  The  Geospace  Radiation  Belt  Storm  Probes
(RBSP) mission, presently in formulation, will undergo a Preliminary Design Review
and a Non-Advocate Review in FY 2008 in preparation for entering development in
early  FY  2009.  RBSP  will  improve  the  understanding  of  how  solar  storms  interact
with Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts. We remain on track to release the next Ex-
plorer  Announcement  of  Opportunity  in  very  early  FY  2008  and  we  hope  to  select
three  new  astrophysics  and  heliophysics  missions,  as  well  as  one  or  more  Missions
of Opportunity, as a result of that call for proposals.

The  Astrophysics  budget  request  of  $1.6  billion  will  support  continued  operation
and  data  analysis  from  NASA’s  orbital  astronomical  observatories,  including  the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space
Telescope,  and  to  build  more  powerful  instruments  to  peer  deeper  into  the  cosmos.
HST is scheduled for a final servicing mission in August 2008 using the Space Shut-
tle.  Along  with  repairs  and  service  life  extension  efforts,  two  new  instruments  will
be  installed  during  the  servicing  mission  that  will  dramatically  extend  HST’s  per-
formance  and  enable  further  discoveries,  including  Wide  Field  Camera  3  (WFC3),
which will re-enable some science observations that have been affected by the recent
failure  of  the  Advanced  Camera  for  Surveys.  After  the  servicing  mission,  HST  is
planned to have six fully operational instruments (including a suite of cameras and
spectrographs  that  will  have  about  10  times  the  capability  of  older  instruments)  as
well  as  other  new  hardware  planned  to  support  another  five  years  of  world-class
space  science.  Additionally,  the  Gamma-ray  Large  Area  Space  Telescope  (GLAST)
will  launch  in  FY  2008  to  begin  a  five-year  mission  mapping  the  gamma-ray  sky
and  investigating  gamma-ray  bursts,  and  the  Kepler  mission  development  will  be
near  completion  in  preparation  for  launch  in  FY  2009,  to  determine  the  frequency
of  Earth-like  planets.  Further,  the  James  Webb  Space  Telescope  astrophysics  flag-
ship  mission  will  undergo  its  Preliminary  Design  Review  and  a  Non-Advocate  Re-
view in FY 2008, in preparation for entering hardware development.

As  the  Subcommittee  is  aware,  the  SOFIA  airborne  observatory,  which  we  have
been developing with the German Aerospace Research Center (DLR) has been rein-
stated.  I  am  pleased  to  report  that  SOFIA  had  its  first  functional  check-out  flight
last week; it is scheduled to undergo an ambitious program of flight testing that be-
gins  this  year  and  will  continue  in  2008.  Though  we  know  of  no  technical
showstoppers  in  regard  to  the  airworthiness  of  the  aircraft  or  operation  of  the  tele-
scope, this program has some remaining hurdles to overcome and so remains subject
to  a  careful  management  review  later  this  spring  chaired  by  the  NASA  Associate
Administrator. The SOFIA program baseline will be finalized at that time.

Also  in  our  Astrophysics  program,  ESA’s  Herschel  and  Planck  missions  are
planned  for  launch  in  FY  2008;  both  of  these  missions  include  important  contribu-
tions and scientific participation from NASA.

While  the  focus  of  this  hearing  is  on  space  science,  I  would  also  like  to  briefly
address  the  FY  2008  President’s  Budget  request  for  Earth  Science.  The  Earth
Science budget request is $1.5 billion, an increase of $27.7 million over the FY 2007
request,  to  better  understand  the  Earth’s  atmosphere,  lithosphere,  hydrosphere,
cryosphere, and biosphere as a single connected system. This request includes addi-
tional funding for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission in response
to the high priority placed on GPM in the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal
Survey.  As  the  follow-on  to  the  highly  successful  Tropical  Rainfall  Measuring  Mis-
sion,  GPM’s  Core  satellite  is  planned  for  launch  no  later  than  2013,  followed  by  a
Constellation  spacecraft  the  following  year.  Other  satellites  in  the  GPM  constella-
tion will be provided by NASA’s international partners or domestic operational part-
ners.  The  Earth  Science  budget  also  includes  increased  funding  for  the  Landsat
Data  Continuity  Mission  and  for  the  Glory  mission,  and  provides  funds  for  the  Na-
tional  Polar-orbiting  Operational  Environmental  Satellite  System  (NPOESS)  Pre-

paratory  Project  (NPP)  to  reflect  instrument  availability  and  launch  delays.  Funds
are  requested  for  continued  development  and  implementation  of  the  Ocean  Surface
Topography Mission to launch in 2008, the Aquarius mission to measure the ocean’s
surface  salinity  to  launch  in  2009,  and  the  Orbiting  Carbon  Observatory  mission
planned for launch in 2008. NASA will continue to be the largest contributor to the
Administration’s Climate Change Science Program by collecting global data sets and
improving  predictive  capabilities  that  will  enable  advanced  assessments  of  the  na-
ture,  causes,  and  consequences  of  global  climate  change.  Over  the  coming  months,
NASA  will  evaluate  strategies  for  implementing  the  recommendations  of  the  Na-
tional  Research  Council’s  Earth  Science  Decadal  Survey  and  responding  to  chal-
lenges to the continuity of climate measurements resulting from the Nunn-McCurdy
recertification  of  the  NPOESS  program.  By  working  together,  NASA  and  NOAA
have already been able to initiate the restoration of one of the de-manifested sensors
to  (the  Ozone  Mapping  and  Profiling  Suite  limb  instrument)  to  the  NPP  satellite,
which will help continue the record of high vertical resolution ozone profile measure-
ments  into  the  next  decade.  I  am  personally  committed  to  continuing  and  contin-
ually  improving  the  working  relationship  between  NASA  and  NOAA,  and  met  with
NOAA executives on my first week in office to transmit this message.
Looking Forward

With  that  overview  of  the  FY  2008  budget  request  as  a  backdrop,  I  turn  now  to
addressing  the  specific  questions  raised  in  the  letter  of  invitation  to  this  hearing.
The  Subcommittee’s  first  question  concerns  my  goals  for  SMD  over  the  next  five
years.

I  view  my  role  as  the  Associate  Administrator  for  SMD  as  being  an  agent  for
change,  to  make  SMD  work  better  and  more  efficiently,  and  to  turn  heads  by  pro-
ducing  landmark  scientific  accomplishments.  With  that  in  mind,  as  outlined  earlier
in  my  testimony,  I  have  three  goals  for  the  organization  that  I  want  to  share  with
you  today.  The  first  is  to  make  strong  progress  advancing  all  four  decadal  surveys,
which we will attack as vigorously as possible, for example by increasing our inter-
national  collaboration  efforts.  The  second  is  to  get  more  science  accomplished  from
our budget. I believe that by looking for ways to increase efficiency within our orga-
nization, and within the way we manage missions, we can make new funding avail-
able  within  the  President’s  budget  that  will  enable  us  to  do  significantly  more.  My
third  objective  is  to  help  ensure  that  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  is  successful
by  increasing  the  scientific  yield  it  will  produce.  There  are  many  ways  that  SMD
and the scientific community will help support the Vision, such as through a robust
lunar  science  research  program.  By  providing  increased  opportunities  to  conduct
lunar  science,  I  believe  that  we  can  grow  a  strong  lunar  community,  just  as  the
Mars community increased once regular flight opportunities were made available in
the mid-1990s.

The  Subcommittee’s  second  question  concerns  SMD’s  top  three  programmatic
risks.  The  first  is  the  rising  cost  of  launches  to  space.  The  Delta-II  launch  vehicle
has  been  the  reliable  workhorse  for  launching  science  missions  to  Earth  orbit  or  in
the  inner  planets  neighborhood  across  SMD  disciplines.  However,  the  supplier  of
that launcher is getting out of the Delta-II business in favor of larger and more ex-
pensive  Evolved  Expendable  Launch  Vehicles  (EELVs).  NASA’s  Space  Operations
Mission Directorate (SOMD) acquires launch services for SMD, and we are working
with SOMD on their assessment of options for the future. These options include: de-
sign  of  the  future  medium-class  mission  set  to  fit  either  larger  or  smaller  ELVs;
planning  to  co-manifest  more  missions  to  optimize  the  use  of  larger  ELVs,  and
working  with  SOMD  to  qualify  new  and  as  yet  unproven  alternate  launch  vehicles
to be offered by new entrants into the market. A second risk area is cost and sched-
ule growth as SMD pursues its challenging flight missions. At both the Agency and
SMD  level,  we  are  putting  in  place  better  cost-estimating  tools  and  capturing  les-
sons  learned  from  recent  missions.  We  are  also  carefully  examining  the  readiness
of  new  technologies  before  we  confirm  missions  that  use  them,  and  we  are  intro-
ducing  new  experience-based  standards  for  the  selection  of  Principal  Investigators.
This ties into the third risk, which is uncertainty in mission development risk. SMD
will  work  harder  to  understand  and  reduce  risks,  rather  than  waiting  for  problems
to  appear  when  missions  are  deep  in  development  when  cost  impacts  are  most  se-
vere. I note that these kinds of emphasis on good management will be key to getting
more  from  our  budget  so  that  future  missions  are  not  delayed  or  canceled  to  pay
for problems on existing mission developments.

The  Subcommittee’s  third  question  concerns  prioritization  and  balance.  NASA’s
approach  to  setting  the  balance  of  investment  among  science  areas  is  based  on  the
following considerations: science value, mission affordability, mission risk, and mis-
sion readiness. The SMD makes a commitment to progress on each of the four SMD-

assigned  science  objectives  in  the  2006  NASA  Strategic  Plan  and  each  of  the  four
decadal surveys produced for us by the National Academy. Long-term outcomes are
science-based,  not  solely  mission-based;  thus  sub-orbital  and  research  and  analysis
(R&A)  programs  are  also  part  of  this.  We  assess  progress  against  community  road-
maps  laid  out  for  each  science  area.  The  pace  of  progress  can  be  influenced  by  ties
to  other  NASA  and  Federal  programs,  e.g.,  the  U.S.  Climate  Change  Science  Pro-
gram and NPOESS in the case of Earth Science, and human exploration time lines
in the case of the Mars Exploration Program. Many science objectives can be accom-
plished  using  a  mix  of  small,  medium  and  large  missions,  international  collabora-
tion, and innovative missions of opportunity; others require large missions that are
more  difficult  to  initiate.  NASA  begins  in  each  science  area  with  the  priorities  de-
fined  in  decadal  surveys  of  the  NRC,  then  generally  sponsors  science  community-
led teams to develop ‘roadmaps’ to plan implementation of survey research and mis-
sion  priorities.  We  then  pass  these  through  the  filter  of  budget  availability  to  set
final priorities that are affordable and at an appropriate stage of technological read-
iness and risk reduction. Within each science area, the challenge is to find the prop-
er  balance  among  large,  medium  and  small  missions,  research  and  analysis  in  all
its  forms,  data  analysis,  and  technology  development.  At  the  Directorate  level,  as
I  previously  highlighted,  I  have  charted  an  Office  of  the  Chief  Scientist  and  ap-
pointed Dr. John Mather to lead that office in making recommendations for the best
way to balance priorities with in and among each of our four portfolio areas.

The  Subcommittee’s  fourth  question  concerns  strategic  investments  in  space  and
Earth  science  I  would  like  to  make  as  the  Associate  Administrator.  I  must  preface
by  noting  that  my  analysis  of  the  SMD  portfolio  is  not  yet  complete  and  that  there
are many areas that likely warrant attention or refocus; I address a few here. I be-
lieve  that,  within  the  SMD  five-year  budget  profile  put  forward  in  the  President’s
FY  2008  request,  SMD  can  make  modest  investments  in  three  key  areas  that  will
yield profound and lasting improvements to our bottom line that will increase in our
understanding  of  the  Earth,  the  Sun,  the  solar  system,  and  the  Universe.  The  first
area  in  which  I  would  invest  is  Research  and  Analysis  (R&A).  This  investment
would, in part, focus on process improvements to make scientists more efficient and
productive;  it  would  also  seek  new  research  funding  initiatives  offered  to  members
of the scientific community. I have appointed a Senior Advisor for R&A, Dr. Yvonne
Pendleton,  to  oversee  SMD’s  efforts  in  this  area  and  to  make  recommendations  for
ways we can improve R&A processes and program content. Dr. Pendleton will work
closely  with  Dr.  Mather  and  the  office  of  Chief  Scientist  in  this  regard.  The  second
investment  I  hope  to  make  is  in  mission  data  analysis,  so  that  the  taxpayer  gets
the best value for the investment we make in science missions. Too often, data anal-
ysis  efforts  are  curtailed  as  a  result  of  rising  mission  development  and  operations
costs.  This  problem  will  be  addressed  beginning  this  year.  The  third  area  in  which
I would invest is our Sub-orbital programs. Sub-orbital flight using rockets and bal-
loons,  as  well  as  aircraft,  provide  opportunities  to  train  new  space  scientists  in  the
art  of  space  flight,  to  bridge  the  2010  to  2012  gap  in  orbital  and  planetary  mission
launches, and to produce some exciting science as well. I would also like to see sub-
orbital opportunities expanded. Again, I believe it is possible to make progress with-
in the SMD five-year budget profile put forward in the FY 2008 President’s request.
Conclusion

In  summary,  let  me  say  that  the  President’s  FY  2008  budget  request  funds  an
exciting, productive, and balanced portfolio of Space and Earth science missions, and
presents  a  program  that  will  yield  even  better  results  than  formerly  anticipated
though  increased  efficiencies.  This  exciting  program  of  research  is  described  in  the
Science  Plan  for  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  (2007–2016),  recently  sub-
mitted  to  this  Subcommittee  as  directed  in  the  NASA  Authorization  Act  of  2005
(P.L. 109–155). I look forward to working with this Subcommittee to implement this
Plan,  as  well  as  my  plans  to  help  shape  SMD  for  the  years  to  come.  I  would  be
happy  to  respond  to  any  questions  the  Subcommittee  may  have  regarding  SMD,
SMD’s portfolio, and the exciting scientific results NASA Is achieving.

STATEMENT OF DR. LENNARD A. FISK, CHAIR, SPACE STUDIES

BOARD, NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL

Dr.  FISK.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of

the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me here to testify.

I  was  asked  to  testify  on  the  top  three  goals  for  NASA’s  Space
Science  Mission  Directorate,  SMD,  top  three  programmatic  risks,
the  top  three  investments  that  should  be  made,  and  also  to  com-
ment  on  the  balance  among  the  various  science  themes  within
SMD.

As you well know, within the last few years, there has been dra-
matic changes in the funding that has been provided to SMD. Some
$3  billion  to  $4  billion  was  removed  from  the  run  out  budget,  pri-
marily to pay for the cost of the return-to-flight of the Shuttle and
the completion of the International Space Station. There is, as was
noted in opening statements, there is no way to remove that much
money from the budget without causing disruptions in ongoing pro-
grams  and  distortion  to  the  balance  among  programs,  and  this  is
the  context  in  which  these  strategic  goals  and  risks  and  invest-
ments required for SMD should be evaluated.

The  first  strategic  goal  for  SMD  might  be  stated  get  back  the
money  that  was  lost.  A  more  constructive  way  to  make  that  state-
ment  would  be  to  note,  as  again  was  made  in  the  opening  state-
ments,  how  inadequate  NASA  as  an  agency  is  currently  funded.  It
is  being  asked  to  do  too  much  with  too  little,  and  as  a  result,  all
components  of  the  Agency,  including  science,  are  sub-optimally
funded.  We  should  all  make  it  a  strategic  goal  to  provide  NASA
with the funding that is required.

The  risk  to  SMD  for  inadequate  funding  is  simply  that  it  can’t
perform  its  assigned  tasks.  The  charge  to  SMD  is  to  explore  the
universe,  lay  down  the  foundation  of  knowledge  required  for  the
human  expansion  into  space.  It  is  to  determine  the  future  of  the

Earth so that we can make sound policy decisions, and it is to con-
tribute  to  the  capability  of  the  United  States  to  compete  in  the
world,  whether  it  is  through  knowledge,  new  technology  or  new
workforce. The funding for SMD is currently inadequate to perform
these tasks.

The  investment  required  is  the  same  investment  the  Nation  is
prepared to make in the American Competitiveness Initiative. It is
difficult, in fact, it is impossible in my judgment to distinguish be-
tween  the  fundamental  science  being  conducted  by  the  NSF  and
the  DOE  Office  of  Science,  and  the  fundamental  science  that  is
being  conducted  by  SMD.  Those  agencies,  of  course,  saw  in-
creases—major increases in support through ACI.

The  first  strategic  goal—excuse  me,  the  second  strategic  goal  for
SMD is to make more cost effective use of the funds that have been
provided  to  it.  There  is  a  disturbing  upward  trend  in  the  cost  of
flight missions, particularly—and I would like to focus on the mod-
erate and small flight missions. The cost of launch vehicles has in-
creased, the cost of management oversight has increased. Whatever
the  reason,  it  should  be  a  strategic  goal  to  get  the  maximum
science  for  the  minimum  funding.  There  will  be  investments  re-
quired  to  achieve  this  goal,  whether  it  is  in  new  launch  vehicles,
new technology, or new management practices.

Finally, if the funds for SMD can be provided, if the missions can
be executed more cost effectively, or preferably both, the third stra-
tegic  goal  should  be  to  use  these  funds  to  rebalance  the  program.
When the funding for the out years in SMD was reduced, the large
flight programs under development were protected. It is the future
that  has  been  sacrificed.  Missions  still  in  technology  development
were  halted.  The  pipeline  that  is  essential  to  the  development  of
technology  of  human  capital,  the  research  and  analysis  program,
the  sounding  rocket  program,  small  flight  missions,  they  are  the
ones  that  were  seriously  disrupted.  The  portfolio  of  activities  in
SMD  needs  to  be  rebalanced  so  that  we  can  compete—complete
what  we  have  begun  while  at  the  same  time  recognizing  that  the
investments  that  we  need  make  now,  whether  it  is  in  people  or  it
is  in  technology  in  the  planning  of  future  flight  missions,  will  de-
termine  the  vibrancy  and  the  success  of  the  scientific  exploration
utilization of space in the decades ahead.

The final question that was asked was the balance among science
disciplines  at  SMD,  and  I  included  all  four  in  answering  these
questions,  astrophysics,  planetary  science,  heliophysics,  and  Earth
science. Each has an important task to perform and each has need
of more funding, more cost effective use of its funding, a rebalance
program,  and  the  investments  required  to  achieve  these  goals  as
we talk.

In  the  case  of  Earth  science,  however,  no  amount  of  efficiencies,
no  internal  rebalance  within  the  discipline,  no  modest  investment
will provide the resources necessary. There is not adequate funding
in  Earth  science  in  NASA  to  accomplish  the  goals  that  have  been
assigned  to  it,  which  is  to  use  the  global  vantage  point  of  space  to
provide information on the immediate future of Earth.

This  is  not  a  rebalancing  question.  It  is  in  the  sense  that  Earth
science should grow at the expense of other science disciplines, nor
should  it  grow  at  the  expense  of  other  programs  within  NASA.  All

of  NASA’s  programs  are  currently  inadequately  funded  and  all
have  a  role  to  play  in  the  national  priorities.  Rather,  it  is  time  for
a new initiative to pursue a vigorous Earth science program.

Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Fisk follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LENNARD A. FISK

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  here  to
testify  today.  My  name  is  Lennard  Fisk  and  I  am  the  Thomas  M.  Donahue  Distin-
guished  University  Professor  of  Space  Science  at  the  University  of  Michigan.  I  also
served  from  1987  to  1993  as  the  NASA  Associate  Administrator  for  Space  Science
and  Applications.  I  appear  here  today  in  my  capacity  as  the  Chair  of  the  National
Research  Council  (NRC)  Space  Studies  Board.  The  views  I  share  with  you  today,
however, are my own and not necessarily those of the NRC.

You  have  asked  me  to  testify  on  the  top  three  goals  for  NASA’s  Science  Mission
Directorate (SMD); the top three programmatic risks facing SMD; the top three stra-
tegic investments that should be made in SMD; and also to comment on the balance
among  the  various  science  themes  within  SMD.  The  first  three  items  are  of  course
interrelated.  The  goals  in  part  should  be  to  eliminate  the  major  risks,  and  identify
the  strategic  investments  needed  to  do  so.  I  will  thus  answer  these  three  questions
as  an  interrelated  set.  I  will  then  comment  on  the  balance  among  NASA’s  space
science disciplines.

Before  considering  the  questions,  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  recent  history
of  SMD,  since  this  context  determines  the  goals,  the  risks,  and  the  investments  re-
quired.  Throughout  much  of  the  history  of  the  space  program,  space  and  Earth
science  in  NASA  was  considered  to  be  a  fixed  fraction  of  the  NASA  budget.  In  the
mid-1990s,  however,  that  rule  was  discarded,  and  the  budget  for  space  and  Earth
science was allowed to grow at the same rate as non-defense discretionary spending.
Human space flight was not permitted this growth, and so the budget for space and
Earth  science  became  an  increasingly  larger  fraction  of  the  overall  NASA  budget.
Whether  deliberate  or  accidental,  the  result  was  that  science  in  NASA  was  consid-
ered  to  be  part  of  the  Nation’s  investments  in  science,  not  simply  as  a  fixed  part
of the investments in space. This rapid growth in science, however, was not uniform.
The  traditional  space  science  disciplines—astrophysics,  planetary  sciences,  and
heliophysics—did very well. However, even in these times of growth in science fund-
ing,  Earth  science  was  kept  at  a  constant  budget,  and  then  in  FY2000  it  began  a
steep decline in funding.

With the advent of the Vision for Exploration in FY 2005, to extend human pres-
ence  first  to  the  Moon  and  then  beyond,  dramatic  changes  have  occurred  in  the
funding  for  SMD.  Initially,  the  overall  funding  for  space  and  Earth  science,  taken
together,  was  projected  to  do  well.  Some  disciplines,  favored  in  the  Vision,  did  very
well,  in  some  cases  at  the  expense  of  other  disciplines;  but  summed  together,  the
funding  for  space  and  Earth  science  continued  to  increase.  However,  it  became  in-
creasingly  obvious  that  NASA  was  not  being  provided  with  the  funds  required  to
execute  the  Vision;  return  the  Shuttle  to  flight,  and  complete  and  use  the  Inter-
national  Space  Station;  maintain  a  healthy  science  program;  and  support  its  other
missions such as aeronautics research. And so the squeeze was on. One by one, the
funding  for  the  various  missions  that  NASA  is  responsible  for  have  been  reduced
to a sub-optimum and, in some cases, critically inadequate funding level.

In the case of the funding for SMD, some $3 billion was removed from the runout
budget  primarily  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  the  return  to  flight  of  the  Shuttle  and  the
completion of the International Space Station. There is no way to remove that much
money  from  a  budget  without  causing  disruptions  in  ongoing  programs  and  distor-
tions  in  the  balance  among  programs.  Ongoing  major  flight  programs,  well  into  de-
velopment, have priority; new flight programs—the future of the program—are seri-
ously  delayed  or  in  effect  canceled.  Small  flight  missions  and  basic  research  sup-
port—for  technology  development,  the  training  of  students,  theory,  data  analysis,
and  new  mission  planning—all  become  vulnerable  when  there  is  a  sudden  and  un-
anticipated change in the expected growth in funding.

To  understand  the  inadequacies  in  the  SMD  budget,  we  need  to  consider  how
science is conducted. Science is about making discoveries—they can be profound dis-
coveries  that  alter  the  concepts  we  hold  of  our  place  in  the  cosmos,  or  they  can  be
minor  discoveries  that  reveal  some  new  aspect  of  a  previously  studied  process.  Dis-
coveries  lead  to  insight,  insight  to  knowledge,  and  in  some  cases  knowledge  yields
immediate applications that benefit society. Knowledge almost always benefits soci-
ety in the long run.

A measure, then, of the health of a science discipline is the pace at which discov-
eries  are  being  made.  Similarly,  the  prospects  for  the  future  of  a  science  discipline
can  be  measured  by  whether  there  are  any  factors  that  limit  the  pace  of  discovery.
Space  and  Earth  science  is  primarily  an  observational  science.  Our  discoveries
thus  come  from  observations.  In  each  of  the  disciplines  in  space  and  Earth  science
there are, in fact, extraordinary opportunities to make discoveries. Technology is ad-
vancing  to  where  more  detailed  and  revealing  observations  can  be  made.  And  our
understanding  of  prior  observations  has  improved  to  where  we  can  search  intel-
ligently for new knowledge.

Given that abundant discoveries await us, if we are only bold enough to make the
observations,  the  primary  determinant  of  a  bright  future  for  space  and  Earth
science  is  the  rate  at  which  we  make  new  observations;  that  is,  the  rate  of  new
space missions. And here the trends are very disturbing. For each of the disciplines
in  SMD  there  is  a  sobering  downward  trend  in  missions  and  thus  opportunities  for
discovery.  In  the  mid-1990s  there  was  an  average  of  seven  launches  per  year  for
missions  in  space  and  Earth  science.  In  the  last  few  years,  the  rate  is  more  like
five per year. In 2010–2012, the rate is projected to be under two per year.

There are some disciplines for which the downward trend in opportunities for dis-
covery  is  clearly  unacceptable.  In  Earth  science,  society  is  demanding  to  know  the
consequences of global climate change in order to plan our future. In the other dis-
ciplines  of  space  science,  it  is  a  grating  waste  of  the  Nation’s  capabilities  to  reduce
our  pace  of  discovery.  We  have  painstakingly  built  the  infrastructure  to  make  the
Nation foremost in the scientific exploration of space. To allow it to atrophy borders
on neglect.

There  is  another  consequence  of  the  inadequacies  of  the  SMD  budget,  and  that
is  the  vitality  of  our  disciplines.  The  issue  for  space  and  Earth  science  is  how  do
we  ensure  the  infusion  of  new  and  better  observing  techniques,  new  minds,  new
ideas  that  challenge  the  established  concepts?  It  is  in  fact  very  difficult  to  ensure
the infusion of revolutionary technologies and concepts in budgets that are not grow-
ing. Rather, there needs to be new investments.

There  is  a  need  to  maintain  or,  better  yet,  optimize  the  pace  of  discovery.  There
is  a  need  to  maintain  the  quality  and  vibrancy  of  the  NASA  science  program
through  the  introduction  of  revolutionary  technologies  and  concepts.  Both  require-
ments  demand  a  budget  for  space  and  Earth  science  that  is  growing.  I  remind  you
that  the  projected  budget  for  space  and  Earth  science  in  NASA  grows  at  only  one
percent  per  year,  which  is  a  declining  budget  when  inflation  is  included.  There
needs instead to be real growth.
Strategic Goals, Risks, and Investments for the Science Mission Directorate
The  first  strategic  goal  of  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  (SMD)  might  well  be
stated—get  back  the  money  that  was  lost.  A  more  constructive  way  to  make  this
statement would be to note how inadequately NASA as an agency is currently fund-
ed.  The  Agency  is  being  asked  to  do  too  much  with  too  little,  and  as  a  result  all
components of the Agency, including science, are sub-optimally funded. We all need
to recognize that without major relief to the total funding for NASA this nation does
not  have  a  viable  space  program  capable  of  meeting  the  broad  national  needs  that
have  been  assigned  to  it.  And  we  should  all  make  it  a  strategic  goal  to  provide
NASA with the funding that is required.

The  risk  to  SMD  from  inadequate  funding  is  that  it  cannot  perform  its  assigned
tasks.  The  charge  to  the  space  and  Earth  science  program  in  NASA  is  to  explore
the  universe  and  lay  down  the  foundational  knowledge  for  the  human  expansion
into  space.  It  is  to  determine  the  future  of  the  Earth,  so  sound  policy  decisions  can
be made to protect the future of our civilization. It is to contribute to the capability
of the United States to compete in the world, whether it is through new knowledge,
new  technology,  or  a  new  workforce.  The  funding  for  space  and  Earth  science  in
NASA,  particularly  the  growth  in  funding  in  the  years  ahead  is  inadequate  to  per-
form  this  job,  and  failure  to  address  this  problem  is  a  fundamental  risk  to  the  suc-
cess  of  SMD  in  being  able  to  fulfill  its  obligations  to  the  scientific  excellence  of  the
Nation.

The  investment  required  in  SMD  is  the  same  investment  that  the  Nation  is  pre-
pared  to  make  in  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative.  ACI  has  resulted  in  in-
creases in funding for programs in fundamental science in, e.g., the National Science
Foundation and the Office of Science in the Department of Energy. These programs
were  among  only  a  few  that  saw  increases  beyond  their  FY  2006  budget  level  in
the  enacted  FY  2007  budget.  It  is  difficult,  in  fact,  impossible,  to  distinguish  be-
tween  the  fundamental  science  conducted  by  NASA  in  SMD  and  the  fundamental
science conducted by the NSF or the DOE Office of Science. It is interesting to note
that  had  the  funding  for  SMD  been  allowed  to  increase  in  the  same  proportion  as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

36

the  NSF  it  would  have  followed  the  pattern  of  growth  it  had  enjoyed  in  the  late
1990s  and  the  early  2000s,  and  would  have  provided  funding  that  was  better  able
to support the needs of the space and Earth science program.

The  second  strategic  goal  is  for  SMD  to  make  more  cost-effective  use  of  the  funds
that have been provided to it. There is a disturbing upward trend in the cost of flight
missions. The problem seems to be most egregious in the case of moderate and small
flight  missions.  We  seem  unable  to  execute  a  mission  of  comparable  complexity
today for anywhere near the cost that was required in the previous decade. The cost
of  launch  vehicles  has  increased.  The  cost  of  management  oversight  is  increasing.
We  take  actions  that  are  perceived  to  reduce  risk,  but  may  not  be  cost  effective.
Whatever  the  reason,  it  should  be  a  strategic  goal  to  get  the  maximum  science  for
the  minimum  funding,  and,  in  my  judgment,  the  most  likely  place  to  realize  cost
savings is in the execution of moderate and small flight missions.

There  is  a  risk  to  SMD  should  it  fail  to  improve  the  cost-effectiveness  with  which
it executes moderate and small flight missions. Under any circumstance, funding will
be limited. We need to get the maximum science for the minimum available funding,
if for no other reason than to introduce flexibility into the SMD budget to fund new
missions and needed investments.

Investments  are  required  to  achieve  the  strategic  goal  of  improving  the  cost-effec-
tiveness  of  small  and  moderate  missions.  Investments  may  be  required  in  new
launch  vehicles  so  that  the  cost  of  access  to  space  is  reduced,  particularly  with  the
planned  retirement  of  the  Delta-II  launch  vehicle.  Investments  will  be  required  in
innovative  management  procedures  and  new  technologies.  There  needs  to  be  a  con-
certed  effort  made  to  make  full  use  of  the  best  of  the  Nation’s  vast  infrastructure
to  conduct  cost-effective  space  missions.  We  have  great  talent  in  this  country  for
space hardware. We need to ensure that we are using this talent properly; that our
processes ensure good engineering solutions and not simply someone’s perceived re-
duction in risk.

If new funds for SMD can be provided, if missions can be executed more cost-effec-
tively, or preferably both, the third strategic goal should be to use the funds realized
to rebalance the program. When the funding in the out-years for SMD was reduced,
the  large  flight  programs  under  development  were  protected.  It  is  the  future  that
has been sacrificed. Missions still in technology development were halted. The pipe-
line  that  is  essential  to  the  development  of  technology  and  human  capital—the  Re-
search  and  Analysis  programs,  sounding  rockets,  small  flight  missions—have  been
seriously disrupted. The portfolio of activities in SMD needs to be rebalanced so that
we complete what we have begun, while at the same time we recognize that the sci-
entific exploration and utilization of space is a long-term effort that will extend into
the  indefinite  future.  The  investments  that  we  make  now,  in  people,  in  technology,
in balloons and sounding rockets, in small flight missions, in the planning for future
flight  missions,  will  determine  the  vibrancy  and  the  success  of  the  scientific  explo-
ration and utilization of space in the decades ahead.

The  risk  of  failing  to  meet  the  strategic  goal  of  rebalancing  the  SMD  program  is,
in my judgment, the most serious risk. The pipeline of human capital and technology
has  been  disrupted,  and  the  future  of  the  space  and  Earth  science  program  is  at
risk.  Consider  a  case  in  point.  Almost  every  experimental  space  scientist  currently
practicing  learned  his/her  trade  in  the  sounding  rocket  or  balloon  programs.  Yet
with  recent  budget  cuts,  these  programs  are  unable  to  perform  this  task.  Small
flight  missions  are  the  next  step  in  the  natural  evolution  of  experimental  capabili-
ties, whether it is the development of new technology or the development of experi-
enced  scientists  and  engineers.  And  yet  with  recent  budget  cuts,  the  flight  rate  of
small missions has been diminished compared to its previous rate.

It follows, then, given the importance of rebalancing the SMD program to protect
the future of space and Earth science, that an investment that ensures a proper pipe-
line in human capital and technology will have the highest return. Research & Anal-
ysis  funding,  sounding  rockets  and  balloons,  and  small  flight  missions  all  need  to
be restored to their proper place in the SMD program.
The  Balance  Among  the  Science  Disciplines  in  the  Science  Mission  Direc-

torate

Each  of  the  science  disciplines  in  SMD—astrophysics,  planetary  sciences,
heliophysics, and Earth science—has important tasks to perform, ranging from pro-
viding fundamental knowledge of the universe, to, in the case of Earth science, pro-
viding knowledge that is a direct and immediate benefit to society. Each of the dis-
ciplines  has  need  of  more  funding,  more  cost-effective  use  of  its  funding,  a  rebal-
anced  program,  and  the  investments  required  to  achieve  these  goals,  as  we  dis-
cussed above.

In the case of Earth science, however, no amount of efficiencies, no internal rebal-
ance  within  the  discipline,  no  modest  investment  will  provide  the  resources  nec-
essary. There is not adequate funding for Earth science in NASA to accomplish the
mission  that  it  has  been  assigned—to  use  the  global  vantage  point  of  space  to  pro-
vide information on the immediate future of Earth, on which we can base sound pol-
icy decisions to protect our future. This deficiency is the result of a downward trend
in the funding for Earth science that has persisted for a decade, and which has been
in  serious  decline  since  FY  2000.  The  recent  NRC  decadal  survey  for  Earth  science
outlined  the  measurements  and  flight  missions  that  NASA  needs  to  accomplish,  to
provide society with the knowledge that is required. And the survey pointed out that
these  measurements  can  be  made  only  if  the  Earth  science  budget,  over  the  next
several  years,  is  increased  back  to  at  least  the  level  of  funding  that  was  available
in FY 2000, an approximately $500 million increase over the current budget.

This  is  not  a  rebalancing  question,  in  the  sense  that  Earth  science  should  grow
at  the  expense  of  other  science  disciplines.  Nor  should  it  grow  at  the  expense  of
other  programs  within  NASA.  All  of  NASA’s  programs  are  currently  inadequately
funded.  And  all  have  a  role  to  play  in  the  national  priorities.  Rather,  it  is  time  for
a  new  initiative,  a  specific  directed  task  to  NASA,  with  requisite  funding  provided,
to  pursue  a  vigorous  Earth  science  program,  in  which  the  required  measurements
on the future of Earth are all made.

We  need  to  consider  NASA  as  an  agency  with  many  important  tasks  to  perform.
It is not just the Agency that is to return us to the Moon, and all else is a secondary
priority.  Space  is  integral  to  the  fabric  of  our  society.  We  depend  on  it  in  our  daily
lives;  we  protect  our  nation  through  our  space  assets;  we  use  space  to  learn  about
our future; we enrich our society with knowledge of our place in the cosmos; we are
moving  our  civilization  into  space;  we  expect  the  next  generation  of  scientists  and
engineers  to  be  versatile  in  the  utilization  and  exploration  of  space.  NASA  has  an
essential  role  to  play  in  each  and  every  one  of  these  national  pursuits,  and  its  role
in each pursuit needs to be properly funded.

Thank you very much.

STATEMENT OF DR. GARTH D. ILLINGWORTH, CHAIR, ASTRON-

38

OMY AND ASTROPHYSICS ADVISORY COMMITTEE (AAAC)
Dr. ILLINGWORTH. Thank you, Chairman Udall, Ranking Member
Calvert, Members of the Committee and Subcommittee. Thank you
for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  NASA’s  astrophysics  pro-
gram.

I  am  the  Chair  of  the  Congressionally  chartered  committee,  the
Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Advisory  Committee.  This  committee
was  established  to  assess  and  make  recommendations  regarding
the  coordination  of  the  astronomy  and  astrophysics  programs  of
NSF,  NASA,  and  DOE,  and  to  assess  progress  on  the  National
Academy’s  Decadal  Survey  on  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics.  While
we deal extensively with all three agencies, NASA has been a par-
ticular  focus  of  our  attention  recently  because  of  the  contrast  with
NSF  and  DOE  science.  The  decreasing  budget  in  real  terms  for
NASA  science  contrasts  very  substantially  with  ACI  led  growth  in
the other agencies, and this is very unfortunate, given that NASA’s
science  missions  play  such  a  central  role  in  scientific  advances  in
the  last  two  decades.  NASA  missions  have  dramatically  changed
our understanding of the universe, of our own solar system, and of
our planet Earth. And so, NASA’s science program has been an ex-
traordinarily successful enterprise.

As we look at the suite of missions that are now available to the
science  community,  as  Alan  emphasized,  we  have  a  wide  array  of
capabilities.  For  astrophysics,  Hubble,  Chandra,  Spitzer  are  all  re-
turning  remarkable  data,  while  several  medium-sized  missions,
GLAST,  Kepler,  WISE,  will  be  launched  over  the  next  few  years.
Yet, this leadership in the scientific and technological arena with
the  visibility  that  it  brings  to  our  nation’s  technological  and  sci-
entific achievements is clearly at risk in the coming years. The rate
at  which  new  missions  are  being  launched  drops  dramatically  in
2009,  and  continues  at  a  low  level  for  many  years  well  into  the
foreseeable future.

Furthermore,  during  the  first  part  of  the  decade,  the  number  of
operating  astrophysics  missions,  of  course,  will  decease,  such  as
current missions near the end of their life. The three great observ-
atories will be replaced by one. JWST, of course, will be a remark-
ably powerful observatory, but it cannot encompass the full breadth
of  science  areas  that  three  great  observatories  do  now,  Chandra,
Hubble, and Spitzer.

SOFIA  will  become  operational,  and  a  possible  small  Explorer.
These are the only new capabilities in the first part of the next dec-
ade.  Furthermore,  the  decline  in  the  astrophysics  budget  in  real
terms,  by  25  percent  starting  2009  and  throughout  for  several
years after that, greatly reduces the opportunities for new missions
following the next Decadal Survey report, which will be released in
2010.

Though NASA has had extraordinary successes over its last dec-
ade  from  its  challenging,  ambitious  science  missions,  it  produced
stunning  science  return.  In  10  to  15  years,  as  we  stand  and  look
back, will we be able to make the same statement? I am concerned
that  we  are  on  a  track  that  will  make  it  very  difficult  and  will
maybe preclude such a positive outlook at that time.

The  next  question  is  how  do  we  recover  from  this?  More  re-
sources  are  clearly  needed,  but  I  would  like  to  emphasize  it  is  my
view  that  it  is  neither  wise  nor  productive  to  expect  that  they  will
come  from  NASA’s  human  space  flight  program.  No  discussion  of
the  budget  challenges  of  the  science  of  NASA  can  take  place  with-
out  acknowledging  the  challenges  that  face  the  Agency  overall.  It
has  become  widely  recognized  that  NASA  is  significantly  under-
funded to the mandate that it has been given to implement the Vi-
sion for Space Exploration. The lack of growth in the NASA budget
is stressing all of the Agency’s activities.

AAAC is deeply concerned about the growing impact on the space
and  Earth  science  program,  and  strongly  endorses  efforts  to  in-
crease  NASA’s  budget  to  allow  it  to  undertake  the  transformation
and  vision  without  imparting  serious  damage  to  the  science  pro-
gram.

The issues faced by NASA are so challenging that they really re-
quire  broad  consensus  between  the  Administration  and  Congress
on the Nation’s goals for its space endeavors. I hope that some form
of  higher  level  discussion  forum  such  as  recently  been  proposed
both  in  the  House  and  the  Senate  does  come  to  fruition  and  pro-
vides  clear  guidance  for  NASA  and  enhancement  of  its  budgetary
framework.

I  would  like  to  comment,  though,  that  in  all  conscience  I  cannot
ask  for  additional  resources  for  the  science  programs  without  com-
menting  on  the  undercosting  that  has  occurred  over  the  last  dec-
ades,  in  fact,  in  our  programs.  The  cost  growth  in  missions  both
moderate  and  large  has  been  substantial  and  clearly  indicates  the
need for better cost estimates for each of the project phases by both
NASA  and  the  Decadal  Survey.  We  need  to  work  together  on  this,
and  the  need  to  use  life  cycle  costs  for  planning  and  roadmapping
instead of just construction costs.

What  counts,  of  course,  is  what  we  are  going  to  be  spending  on
a mission over the 10- to 20-year lifetime of that program, and not
just  what  it  takes  to  build  a  mission.  When  mentioning  cost
growth,  JWST  is  the  immediate  program  that  comes  to  mind,  but
SIM  and  SOFIA  are  comparable  examples.  All  of  these  programs
have suffered huge growth with their budget over the numbers that
were  given  in  our  Decadal  Surveys.  SIM  and  SOFIA  were  both
$250  million  missions  in  1990.  Both  are  now  $3  billion  programs.
JWST  went  from  $1  billion  to  $4.5  billion.  But  this  is  not  new.
Chandra,  the  current  mission  we  are  flying  in  x-ray  astronomy,
was  a  $500  million  mission  in  1980  and  when  re-costed  in  current
dollars, it is $3.4 billion. So we clearly do need to understand much
more carefully and fully the programs that we are putting forward.
So  it  is  really  clear  that  we  need  to  develop  reliable  and  robust
life  cycle  cost  estimates.  I  think  it  is  to  the  credit  of  both  NASA
and the community that there is recognition of this and much more
open  discussion  of  these  issues,  and  it  is  my  view  that  we  will  do
better, but it will take significant effort.

I  would  just  like  to  note  on  a  couple  of  the  questions  that  came
from  the  Chairman,  since  I  am  running  out  of  time  on  this,  was
that  I  would  like  to  note  the  three  risks  that  were  mentioned  in
the  question,  and  they,  in  my  view,  are  the  lack  of  small  and  me-
dium  missions  beyond  2009;  the  inability  to  respond  to  the  2010

Decadal  Survey,  I  think  we  will  do  a  very  serious  effort  of  putting
forward  an  incredibly  vibrant  science  program  that  is  much  more
realistically  costed,  but  it  would  be  tragic  if  we,  in  fact,  were  not
in a position to respond to that; and the current lack of technology
development and mission development funding is a serious concern
as well, because this obviously impacts mission cost and readiness.
And  the  three  strategic  investments  that  I  would  make  would  be
R&A  funding—I  think  there  is  unity  on  the  importance  of  this
across  the  community  and  probably  amongst  the  speakers  here;
technology  development  for  missions;  and  the  importance  of  com-
peted  cost-capped  missions  at  the  small  and  medium  level  as  well.
So  in  closing,  I  would  like  to  emphasize  the  remarkable  produc-
tivity  of  the  current  program,  but  the  dramatic  changes—and  not
for  the  better,  unfortunately,  lie  ahead  if  we  continue  with  the
budget of this declining substantially in real terms.

Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. I am happy to re-

spond further.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Illingworth follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARTH D. ILLINGWORTH

Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  tes-
tify.  I  am  a  Professor  and  Astronomer  at  the  University  of  California,  Santa  Cruz
and  the  University  of  California  Observatories/Lick  Observatory.  I  am  the  Chair  of
the  Congressionally-chartered  FACA  committee,  the  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics
Advisory  Committee  (AAAC).  This  committee  was  established  to  assess  and  make
recommendations  regarding  the  coordination  of  astronomy  and  astrophysics  pro-
grams of NSF, NASA and DOE and progress on the National Academy National Re-
search Council’s (NRC) Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal reports. As required by
the  enabling  legislation,  the  AAAC  generates  an  Annual  Report  in  March  of  each
year  (the  2007  AAAC  report  is  at  http://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/aaac.jsp).  As  Chair
of the AAAC, the recommendations of that committee underpin this testimony.

In  addition  to  responding  to  the  questions  from  the  Chairman,  I  would  also  like
to highlight some issues that were a concern of the AAAC and will increasingly im-
pact science at NASA unless rectified. Arguably science is the crown jewel of NASA.
The  science  missions  give  NASA  great  return  through  their  frequent  and  exciting
results that capture the imagination of the public. They are equally a frequent dem-
onstration  of  our  nation’s  scientific  and  technical  capabilities.  However,  that  jewel
is  becoming  tarnished  by  the  effective  reductions  in  the  NASA  Science  Mission  Di-
rectorate (SMD) budget.
SCIENCE AT NASA AND THE CURRENT NASA BUDGET PROJECTIONS

Science at NASA: NASA’s science program has been an extraordinarily success-
ful enterprise. The scientific productivity of its diverse suite of science missions has
made  many  of  them  household  names.  Missions  like  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope
(HST),  the  Mars  Rovers,  the  very  successful  Explorer  missions  like  the  Wilkinson
Microwave  Anisotropy  Probe  (WMAP),  the  remarkable  outer  planet  images  in  our
Solar  System  from  Cassini-Huygens  and  Galileo,  along  with  numerous  other  re-
markable  missions  and  projects,  are  a  demonstration  of  U.S.  technological  leader-
ship.  NASA  has  shown  time  and  time  again  that  novel  technology,  driven  by  great
science goals, can dramatically expand our horizons and bring exploration of the cos-
mos  beyond  our  Earth  within  the  reach  of  all.  NASA’s  missions  have  dramatically
changed  our  understanding  of  the  universe—its  origin,  evolution  and  structure,  the
existence of massive black holes, when and how galaxies formed, and the birthplaces
of  star  and  planets—our  solar  system,  and  our  home  planet  Earth.  The  value  of
these  science  missions  is  widely  recognized  for  generating  enthusiasm  for  science
and engineering and for stimulating the interest of the Nation’s youth.

Yet  this  leadership  in  the  scientific  and  technological  arena—with  the  visibility
that  it  brings  to  U.S.  technological  and  scientific  achievements—is  clearly  at  risk
in  the  coming  years.  The  breadth  and  balance  within  NASA’s  science  program  is  a
major  factor  in  this  visibility.  The  substantial  budget  changes  envisaged  for  the
coming five years are already having a major impact on the future science program.
The  resulting  major  restructuring  of  the  long-term  science  program  is  a  great  con-
cern to the science community and will, over time, significantly change NASA’s per-

ceived value to the Nation. NASA has had extraordinary successes over the last dec-
ade  from  its  challenging,  ambitious  science  missions,  combined  with  continuing,
broadly-based  research  support  that  produces  stunning  science  return  from  a  di-
verse  portfolio  of  programs.  In  ten  years  as  we  look  back,  will  we  be  able  to  make
the  same  statement?  There  will  be  highlights,  but  will  we  feel  that  NASA’s  science
program  has  had  its  golden  era?  I  feel  very  strongly  that  we  all  do  not  want  that
to  be  the  case,  but  if  we  are  to  explore  our  universe  and  our  Earth  through  the
unique  capabilities  that  NASA  brings,  then  we  must  step  up  to  the  plate  and  com-
mit the resources needed.

The  problems  that  are  visible  in  SMD  flow  not  just  from  NASA  trying  to  imple-
ment  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration,  but  also  from  the  recovery  from  the  loss  of
Columbia  and  major  impacts  such  as  Katrina.  Science  at  NASA  suffered  a  major
hit  when  ∼$3B  was  removed  from  SMD  in  the  FY07  five-year  projected  budget  re-
quest.  The  SMD  budget  is  now  down  seven  percent  in  inflation-adjusted  FY06  dol-
lars  by  2012  in  the  FY08  request,  instead  of  growing  as  in  the  FY06  request.  The
reduced  SMD  budget  stems  from  the  overall  problems  of  the  NASA  budget  and  it’s
disconnect  with  its  current  mandate.  This  is  discussed  further  below,  after  the  dis-
cussion  of  the  role  of  NASA  science  in  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative
(ACI).

Innovation, Competitiveness, ACI and NASA: Research is essential to innova-
tive  activities  and  underpins  a  technologically-competitive  society,  as  enunciated  in
the  NRC  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm.  The  inclusion  of  ACI  increases
in the FY07 budget request for NSF, DOE Science and NIST was a very strong re-
sponse to the challenges faced by the Nation in staying at the forefront of scientific
and technological development. The continuation of the ACI in the FY08 budget re-
quest  demonstrated  the  Administration’s  commitment  to  building  a  robust  R&D
base  in  the  physical  sciences.  Congressional  support  for  NSF  research  and  DOE
science in the FY07 appropriation through the Joint Funding Resolution was a fur-
ther key step in strengthening science and technology through the Congressional In-
novation  and  Competitiveness  effort.  However,  the  exclusion  of  NASA  science  from
the  ACI  contrasts  with  the  inclusion  of  DOE  science.  There  is  no  question  that
NASA  is  at  the  cutting-edge  of  science  and  technology  research.  This  exciting  and
highly  visible  research  contributes  to  the  vitality  of  the  national  skill  set  and  has
encouraged  young  people  to  move  into  science  and  engineering.  The  Congressional
interest in Innovation and Competitiveness enables a fresh opportunity for enhanc-
ing  NASA  science.  The  AAAC  in  its  Annual  Report  strongly  encourages  Congress
to consider enhancing the support for science at NASA explicitly to improve innova-
tion and competitiveness, as has been done for NSF and DOE science.

Funding  for  NASA  for  the  Vision  for  Exploration:  Before  discussing  the
science  program  further  I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  overall  context  in  which
the NASA science budget is developed. It has become widely recognized that NASA
is  significantly  underfunded  for  the  mandate  that  it  has  been  given  to  implement
the Vision for Space Exploration. No discussion of the budget challenges for science
at  NASA  can  take  place  without  acknowledgement  of  the  challenges  that  face  the
Agency  overall.  The  challenges  of  transitioning  within  the  current  NASA  budget  to
a  new  generation  of  space  capabilities  in  the  framework  of  the  Exploration  Vision,
with  no  new  funding,  are  obvious.  NASA’s  overall  budget  has  remained  essentially
unchanged  through  the  last  three  budget  requests.  Yet  in  that  timeframe  the  real
costs of the transition to a new human space flight structure have been recognized.
As  a  result,  the  balance  among  the  needs  of  Space  Shuttle  (STS)  operations  and
ramp-down, International Space Station (ISS) completion and operation, Exploration
Systems  development  and  a  robust  Space  and  Earth  Science  program  has  come
under great strain. I recognize the support that the Administrator has to transition
the Agency from being driven by the vestiges of its past program—one that was de-
vised  in  the  1970s—into  a  new,  forward-looking  set  of  objectives.  Broadly  I  support
the goals of transitioning the human space flight program into a new set of capabili-
ties.  A  nation  as  technically-advanced  as  ours,  with  such  human,  technological  and
fiscal resources, should be able to explore beyond the Earth. Furthermore, these new
capabilities  will  benefit  science  missions  and  scientific  ‘‘exploration.’’  But  to  ask
NASA to transition and develop these new capabilities, while undercutting its most
innovative  and  productive  component,  its  science  program,  is  unwise.  NASA  needs
more  resources  if  it  is  to  explore  in  a  ‘‘feet  on  the  ground’’  sense  through  a  human
space flight program, and to explore our universe by unearthing its secrets through
a vibrant science program.

The AAAC hopes that Congress can work to rectify this problem, since the recent
fiscal  year  requests  have  not  provided  the  resources  to  enable  NASA  to  carry  out
its mandate in the Vision. Adequate funding is critical over the next few years when

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

NASA  is  trying  to  support  Shuttle  operations  and  ramp-down,  completing  the  ISS,
initiating new launch and transportation capability, and carrying out a comprehen-
sive  science  program.  Long-term  impacts  to  both  science  and  human  space  flight
will accrue if the funding is not adequate during this period. The AAAC recognized
the issues with its highest-priority recommendation in its Annual Report in the dis-
cussion re NASA: ‘‘The lack of growth in the NASA budget to respond to the
Exploration  Vision  is  stressing  all  the  Agency’s  activities.  The  AAAC  is
deeply concerned about the growing impact on the space and Earth science
program.’’  The  AAAC  was  also  concerned  about  the  potential  out-year  impact  of
the  reduced  funding  for  NASA  overall  in  the  FY07  appropriation  if  this  funding  is
used as a base for the FY08 appropriation. The science community appreciated that
the  FY07  Joint  Resolution  budget  for  NASA  explicitly  designated  and  made  statu-
tory only a small cut (∼1.5 percent) to science compared to the FY07 budget request
level,  but  remains  concerned  that  further  cuts  may  arise  if  the  FY07  base  is  used.
The  AAAC  noted:  ‘‘The  AAAC  is  concerned  that  the  appropriation  for  FY08
and  beyond  may  lead  to  a  further  cut  by  using  the  FY07  appropriation  as
the base for future budgets, and recommends that the FY08 request be the
base to preclude added impacts on science at NASA.’’

The  issues  faced  by  NASA  are  so  challenging  that  they  really  require  broad  con-
sensus between the Administration and Congress on the Nation’s goals for its space
endeavors.  I  hope  that  some  form  of  high  level  discussion  forum,  such  as  has  been
recently  proposed  both  in  the  House  and  Senate  comes  to  fruition,  and  provides
clear guidance for NASA and enhancement of its budgetary framework.

Astrophysics—an  overview:  If  one  takes  a  near-term  view,  and  looks  forward
with a horizon around 2009–2010, the mission mix in Astrophysics looks fairly good.
Over the next ∼5 or so years Astrophysics will have a reasonably well-balanced pro-
gram, i.e., one with a mix of small, medium and large missions in operation covering
a  diverse  range  of  scientific  areas.  The  launch  of  a  mid-size  mission,  the  Gamma
Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST—in late 2007), a Discovery mission Kepler
(in  2008),  an  Explorer  mission,  the  Wide-Field  Infrared  Survey  Explorer  (WISE—
in 2009), and participation in two powerful European Space Agency (ESA) missions
Herschel  and  Planck  (2008–9)  strengthens  the  program.  Astrophysics  is  operating
three  Great  Observatories,  Chandra,  Hubble  and  Spitzer,  and  providing  significant
funding  for  data  analysis  for  those  missions.  The  next  Hubble  Servicing  Mission
(SM4)  and  the  instrument  upgrades  will  rejuvenate  Hubble.  The  Stratospheric  Ob-
servatory  for  Far-Infrared  Astronomy  (SOFIA)  is  moving  towards  its  first  science
demonstration  in  2010  and  full  science  operation  in  2013.  NASA  is  progressing  on
an extremely powerful Great Observatory-class mission, the James Webb Space Tel-
escope  (JWST).  NASA  is  also  planning  for  a  possible  Beyond  Einstein  mission  that
would  begin  to  be  funded  for  development  in  the  same  time  frame  (though  its
launch  would  not  be  until  the  middle  of  the  decade  or  beyond).  These  elements  of
the  program  are  consistent  with  community-developed  strategic  plans  such  as  the
National Academy Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey.

So  why  is  the  astronomy  and  astrophysics  community  so  concerned?  And  why  is
this  concern  reflected  so  strongly  in  the  AAAC  annual  reports,  and  the  reports  and
discussions  of  the  NASA  Advisory  Council  (NAC)  Astrophysics  Science  Sub-
committee, and the NRC committees (Space Studies Board—SSB; Board on Physics
and Astronomy—BPA, Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics—CAA)? First, the
cuts  that  have  occurred  in  the  Research  and  Analysis  (R&A)  funds  are  a  very  seri-
ous  issue  for  the  community.  R&A  funds  support  theory  and  modeling,  training  of
students and postdocs, and development of new technologies, and so are of great fu-
ture  value  to  NASA  as  well  as  the  community.  Second,  it  is  when  we  look  up  from
the  immediate  future  and  look  down  the  road  that  we  see  that  the  new  mission
pipeline  is  strikingly  empty  beyond  2009.  This  is  a  major  issue.  This  can  be  seen
in  the  Figure  below.  The  next  few  years  look  good  because  we  are  benefiting  from
the  achievements  of  the  past  decade,  or  even  longer.  The  missions  from  the  1990s
and  early  2000s  are  operating  or  coming  to  fruition—but  the  dearth  of  new  small
and medium missions initiated in the last few years is reflected in the next decade.
SOFIA  does  not  come  into  full  science  operations  until  2013.  JWST,  when  it
launches in 2013, will be an amazing observatory, as dramatic in its way as Hubble
was in 1993 (when its optics were corrected), or when the Hubble Advanced Camera
was  installed  in  2002.  In  contrast  to  these  major  programs  there  is  nothing  else  in
the  years  2010–2014,  except  for  a  possible  Small  Explorer  (SMEX)  in  Astrophysics
in ∼2014 (from the recent SMEX announcement of opportunity—AO).

How  limited  the  options  are  for  Astrophysics  can  be  seen  in  the  Table  below.  In
real terms the Astrophysics Division suffers a precipitous decline in FY09 (down by
23  percent  in  constant  dollars  relative  to  2006)  that  worsens  in  the  outyears.  Even
though  a  number  of  important  and  productive  missions  will  be  operating  into  the
next  decade,  the  long  lag  between  inception  and  launch  will  lead  to  a  period  with
far  fewer  operating  missions  by  the  middle  of  the  next  decade,  unless  this  budget
trend is reversed.

Need  for  better  cost  estimates  and  the  use  of  ‘‘life  cycle’’  costing:  I  have
emphasized the impact of the projected budget decreases for the science program at
NASA,  with  particular  emphasis  on  the  situation  in  Astrophysics.  But  I  think  we
all  recognize  that  there  is  another  aspect  that  has  impacted  our  ability  to  plan
ahead—and  that  is  the  unrealistic  and  incomplete  costs  estimates  that  have  been
used  in  the  past  for  science  projects  by  NASA  and  the  community.  The  AAAC  has
strongly  encouraged  the  adoption  of  a  consistent  and  common  approach  to  mission
costing by the community and NASA, and advocated that the baseline be ‘‘life cycle’’
costs  (from  conceptual  development  through  the  end  of  operations—from  pre-Phase
A through Phase E). Doing so would eliminate some of the uncertainty that has sur-
rounded cost numbers in community discussions and lead to more realistic costs. In
addition, better cost estimation is needed for the Phases, utilizing independent cost
estimates as a cross-check. The transition to full-cost accounting at the NASA Cen-
ters also is resulting in more realistic cost estimates for missions.

The  Decadal  Survey  recommendations  are  typically  implemented  over  10–15
years. This is therefore the timeframe over which we should be costing our missions
if  we  are  to  match  our  recommended  mission  suite  to  likely  budgets.  The  full  costs
of JWST, the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), and SOFIA over that 10–15 year
timeframe were not appreciated because the costs used for planning in the Decadal
Survey and elsewhere were typically construction or Phase C/D costs (and also were

44

not subject to an independent cost study). This ‘‘undercosting’’ (to use the NASA Ad-
ministrator’s  very  appropriate  word)  has  led  to  a  gap  between  what  we  wanted  to
do  and  what  we  can  do.  Fortunately,  both  NASA  and  the  astronomy  community
have  recognized  the  problem  that  this  approach  has  caused.  We  do  not  want  to  re-
peat this mistake and so ways to improve the mission and project budgets are under
serious discussion for the next Decadal Survey.

One  important  step  in  being  more  realistic  about  mission  costs  is  to  ensure  that
we understand the ‘‘life cycle’’ costs of our currently operating missions. These esti-
mates  have  significant  uncertainty,  given  the  very  different  situations  under  which
the  missions  were  developed.  Nonetheless,  they  will  allow  us  all  to  compare  new,
current  and  old  missions  in  a  more  uniform  way.  Some  examples  are  (for  life  cycle
costs  in  current  dollars  in  a  full-cost  accounting  environment,  including  design  and
technology,  construction,  launch  and  operations):  HST:  ∼$7.5–9B  (including  SM4
plus  five  years  of  added  operations);  Chandra:  ∼$3.4B  (15  years  of  operations);
Spitzer:  ∼$1.3B  (with  operations  through  2011);  Cassini-Huygens:  ∼$3B  (including
ESA  and  DOE  contributions);  JWST:  ∼$4.5B  (assuming  2013  launch  and  10  years
of  operations);  SIM:  ∼$3B  (uncertain  since  launch  date  unclear—12  years  of  oper-
ations); SOFIA: $3.4B (with 20 years of operations).

The  Decadal  Survey  numbers  were  traditionally  ‘‘construction’’  costs.  These  were
typically  under-estimated  and  this,  in  combination  with  the  change  to  life  cycle
costs, led to some dramatic increases. JWST (2000 survey as NGST) has gone from
$1B  to  $4.5B,  but  such  cost  growth  is  not  rare.  Chandra  (1980  survey  as  AXAF)
went  from  $500M  to  $3.4B.  SOFIA  (1990  survey)  went  from  $230M  to  $3.4B.  SIM
(1990  survey  as  AIM)  grew  similarly  $250M  to  ∼$3B.  Correcting  for  inflation
changes the factors a little, but the growth is still very large. The examples of SIM
and SOFIA, both of which were moderate-size ∼$250M missions in the 1990 Survey,
but  which  grew  to  be  $3B  programs  life  cycle,  have  made  us  aware  of  the  chal-
lenges. JWST was a major surprise when it grew to $4.5B life cycle, but given that
we  now  understand  that,  in  current  dollars,  with  full-cost  accounting,  Chandra  is
a  $3.4B  program  and  HST  is  over  double  that,  the  life  cycle  cost  of  JWST,  while
high, is not extraordinary compared to other major programs.

The  discrepancies  clearly  indicate  the  need  for  better  cost  estimates  for  each  of
the project Phases by both NASA and the Decadal Survey, and the use of life cycle
costs for planning. Great cost detail is not necessary (nor is it possible), but knowing
that  JWST  would  be  an  ∼$4B  program  life  cycle  instead  of  a  $1B  program,  or  that
SIM  and  SOFIA  would  be  ∼$3B  life  cycle  instead  of  $0.25B,  would  certainly  help
the  development  of  a  more  robust  Decadal  Survey,  and  subsequent  planning  and
roadmapping. It is already clear that developing reliable life cycle mission cost esti-
mates  is  considered  to  be  very  important  for  the  next  Decadal  Survey—both  NASA
and the community are learning from our previous mistakes.
Summary

The key points from this discussion are:

• NASA’s  science  program  has  been  an  extraordinarily  successful  enterprise.
NASA has shown time and time again that novel technology, driven by great
science  goals,  can  dramatically  expand  our  horizons  and  bring  exploration  of
the cosmos beyond our Earth within the reach of all.
• The  exclusion  of  NASA  science  from  the  ACI  contrasts  with  the  inclusion  of
DOE  science;  the  AAAC  encourages  Congress  to  consider  enhancing  the  sup-
port  for  science  at  NASA  explicitly  to  encourage  innovation  and  competitive-
ness, as has been done for NSF and DOE science.
• The lack of growth in the NASA budget to respond to the mandate of the Ex-
ploration  Vision  is  stressing  all  the  Agency’s  activities.  The  AAAC  is  deeply
concerned  about  the  growing  impact  on  the  space  and  earth  science  program
and strongly endorses efforts to increase NASA’s budget to allow it to under-
take  the  transformation  envisaged  in  the  Vision,  without  imparting  serious
damage to the science program.
• The  decline  in  the  Astrophysics  budget  in  real  terms  by  ∼25  percent  (from
2009)  greatly  reduces  the  opportunities  for  new  missions  following  the  next
Decadal  Survey  in  2010.  Even  though  a  number  of  important  and  productive
missions  will  be  operating  into  the  next  decade,  the  long  lag  between  incep-
tion  and  launch  will  lead  to  a  period  with  far  fewer  operating  missions,  with
scientific  and  productivity  impacts,  by  the  middle  of  the  next  decade,  unless
this budget trend is reversed.
• The  cost  growth  in  missions,  both  moderate  and  large,  clearly  indicates  the
need  for  better  cost  estimates  for  each  of  the  project  Phases  by  both  NASA
and the Decadal Survey, and the need to use life cycle costs for planning and

roadmapping. It is already clear that developing reliable and robust life cycle
mission cost estimates is considered to be very important for the next Decadal
Survey—both  NASA  and  the  community  are  learning  from  our  previous  mis-
takes.

I would also like to add that the changes in SMD under the new Associate Admin-
istrator Alan Stern are being viewed very positively. His efforts to add to the many
very  experienced  people  in  SMD  with  new  people  to  strengthen  the  scientific  focus
of the Directorate is being well received in the community.
RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS FROM THE CHAIRMAN
1. What  are  the  AAAC’s  concerns  and  recommendations  with  respect  to

NASA’s astrophysics program?
The  AAAC  noted  a  number  of  concerns  in  its  report.  The  broadest  issues  con-
cerning  the  NASA  budget  (‘‘too  small  for  the  mandate  it  has  been  given’’)  and  ACI
(‘‘NASA  science  is  equally  as  important  for  the  Nation  as  DOE,  NSF,  and  NIST
science’’) were discussed above. The AAAC is very concerned that the NASA science
program  has  been  seriously  impacted  and  that  further  stresses  lie  ahead  for  a
science  program  that  has  been  such  an  effective  demonstration  of  U.S.  science  and
technology leadership. These broad concerns led directly to two of the AAAC’s 2007
recommendations: ‘‘NASA’s science funding outlook should be restored. Doing
so  would  be  entirely  consistent  with  the  commitment  to  innovation  and
competitiveness already demonstrated by the Administration and Congress
for  the  NSF  and  the  DOE  Office  of  Science’’  and  ‘‘The  AAAC  strongly  en-
courages  Congress  to  consider  enhancing  the  support  for  science  at  NASA
explicitly to improve innovation and competitiveness, as has been done for
NSF and DOE science.’’

Beyond  the  budget  question  (but  obviously  related)  the  central  issue  is  the  trend
in  the  mission  mix  in  Astrophysics.  It  is  clear  that  Astrophysics  at  NASA  is  living
off  the  past  and  the  mission  pipeline  will,  with  the  exception  of  JWST,  largely  run
dry  post-2009.  JWST  will  be  a  remarkably  powerful  observatory,  as  dramatic  in  its
impact  as  Hubble  was  in  the  1990s,  but  astronomy  and  astrophysics  encompasses
much  more  than  the  science  enabled  by  JWST.  The  only  other  new  opportunities
are  SOFIA,  a  possible  SMEX  by  2014  and  a  possible  Beyond  Einstein  mission  by
the  middle  of  the  decade.  Serious  problems  with  cost  growth,  both  from  underesti-
mates and from not using life cycle costs, have occurred in a wide range of programs
from  Explorers  through  Discovery  to  large  missions  like  SIM,  SOFIA,  JWST  and
HST  SM4.  The  cost  growth  has  combined  with  the  budget  changes  to  leave  the  fu-
ture looking bleak.

Other  areas  of  concern  and  recommendations  in  the  AAAC  2007  Annual  Report
are  summarized  here  (and  discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  2006–2007  AAAC  report
at http://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/aaac.jsp):

Research  and  Analysis  (R&A)  funding.  The  widespread  concerns  in  the  com-
munity about the cuts and trends in R&A funding were reflected in the report. R&A
encourages  creative  extension  of  archived  data,  theoretical  studies  that  can  cross
traditional  disciplinary  boundaries,  laboratory  studies  that  provide  fundamental
measurements, and new instrumentation and sensor technologies that pave the way
for  new  science  initiatives.  With  its  strong  academic  emphasis  R&A  is  a  key  factor
in  the  scientific  training  and  development  of  younger  members  of  the  community—
reductions  will  certainly  impact  their  involvement  and  run  counter  to  the  overall
goals of ACI. The R&A program is broader than mission-specific data analysis, and
has significant direct value to NASA for science planning and future flight opportu-
nities.  A  strong  R&A  program  will  result  in  greater  productivity  from  the  mission
investment at NASA.

The  AAAC  would  very  much  like  to  see  recovery  (and  enhancement)  of  the  very
valuable  R&A  program.  However,  we  recognized  the  great  strains  on  the  Astro-
physics budget in the near-term due to SOFIA reinstatement, HST SM4 delays, pre-
paring  for  GLAST,  Kepler  and  WISE  launches  and  ensuring  JWST  stays  on  track,
so  we  were  reluctant  to  recommend  an  ‘‘unfundable  activity.’’  In  the  end  we  rec-
ommended that R&A be given high priority if any additional funds became available
in the near-term, and if not, that R&A be considered for recovery in the 2009–2010
timeframe as part of the ‘‘wedge’’ that opens up as HST servicing mission activities
are  ramped  down  and  as  JWST  construction  funding  ramps  down.  We  recognize
that incrementing R&A competes with the ‘‘Beyond Einstein’’ and the ‘‘Decadal Sur-
vey’’  wedges,  but  that  exemplifies  the  very  serious  problems  faced  by  Astrophysics.
Competed,  cost-capped  missions.  The  Explorer  and  Discovery  mission  lines
have been very productive. The AAAC believes that a similar program of larger cost-

46

capped missions, the Einstein/Origins Probes (analogous to the Planetary Division’s
New  Frontiers  line),  would  be  particularly  valuable  for  Astrophysics.  Several  con-
cepts  for  Probes  are  being  discussed,  including  the  Joint  Dark  Energy  Mission
(JDEM).  The  AAAC  felt  that  development  of  this  concept  and  discussion  with  the
Decadal  Survey  about  their  potential  broad  value  to  Astrophysics  would  be  a  valu-
able step and recommended that the Probes be discussed as a mission line for Astro-
physics.

Current  major  programs  in  Astrophysics.  The  AAAC  discussed  a  number  of
the major activities in its report because of their importance to the Astrophysics pro-
gram.

• The AAAC was very encouraged by the results of the JWST Technology Non-
Advocate  Review.  Technically,  JWST  appears  to  be  in  excellent  shape,  with
all major technologies at TRL–6 (flight readiness). The added contingency pro-
vides  a  better  buffer  too.  JWST  is  a  major,  cutting-edge  project  and  we  are
not  naive  enough  to  expect  a  completely  smooth  progression  to  launch,  but
the  committee,  like  the  community  at  large,  hopes  that  its  cost-growth  prob-
lems are now in the past.

• The  committee  is  very  supportive  of  HST  SM4,  even  more  so  now  that  the
ACS has failed. A modern camera is needed to restore Hubble’s imaging capa-
bility. Accommodating the costs of servicing remains a major challenge, espe-
cially budgeting for the four-month launch delay in 2008. This further reduces
the flexibility within the Astrophysics program.

• The  Navigator  program  is  under  stress,  with  two  large  missions,  TPF  and
SIM,  given  the  recognition  that  SIM  is  in  reality  a  ∼$3B  program.  Guidance
from the ExoPTF and the Decadal Survey is needed on how to move forward
on the study of other planetary systems.

Major  mission  technology  and  conceptual  development.  It  is  crucial  that
programs  under  consideration  for  implementation  by  the  Decadal  Survey  process
reach  a  level  of  maturity  that  is  characterized  by  a  well-defined  architecture  with
well-vetted costs. The AAAC has emphasized that consistent support, roughly at the
$10M level, would make a significant difference in the robustness of the mission se-
lections  in  the  next  Decadal  Survey.  The  AAAC  recommended  that  early  phase  de-
velopment  funds  for  the  major  missions  in  Beyond  Einstein  (Constellation-X;  Con-
X and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna; LISA) and in Navigator (Terrestrial
Planet  Finder;  TPF)  should  be  continued  if  possible  until  the  Decadal  Survey  re-
evaluates the mission suite in the Astrophysics arena.

SOFIA.  The  SOFIA  program  underwent  dramatic  changes  in  the  last  year:  the
project  was  first  reduced  to  $0  and  effectively  terminated.  SOFIA  then  underwent
a  recovery  and  is  now  part  of  the  Astrophysics  budget.  SOFIA  has  had  a  troubled
and  costly  development  history  and  will  not  reach  full  operations  until  2013,  more
than  15  years  after  the  project  began.  SOFIA  has  a  distinctly  different  operational
model, akin to ground-based telescopes, in that its instruments can be developed to
take  advantage  of  ongoing  technological  developments.  Because  of  this  the  science
opportunities  can  be  high.  SOFIA  is  a  major  mission,  with  a  full  life  cycle  cost  for
20  years  of  operations  that  is  $3.4B  (FY08  budget  request).  From  FY09  its  yearly
cost  is  estimated  to  be  $90M,  including  Institutional  costs,  broadly  comparable  to
Hubble (excluding servicing costs) and JWST. When fully operational, SOFIA is esti-
mated  to  provide  ∼900  hours  of  on-target  time  per  year  for  science  observations—
space  missions  average  significantly  more  (HST ∼2500  hrs.;  JWST ∼6000  hrs.).  The
cost-per-hour  of  on-target  operation  is  comparable  to  Hubble  and  several  times
JWST,  and  so  the  AAAC  considers  that  it  is  crucial  that  SOFIA  operates  as  effi-
ciently as possible and fully involves the science community to provide high science
returns.

Advisory  structure.  The  AAAC  expressed  great  concern  last  year  in  our  2006
report  about  the  lack  of  an  advisory  process  at  NASA,  and  were  very  encouraged
when the new NASA advisory committees were established. The new structure has,
however, lost a valuable role that was once provided by the Space Science Advisory
Committee  (SScAC).  That  structure  encouraged  dialogue,  on  wide-ranging  issues
that  cut  across  the  SMD  divisions,  between  SMD  and  a  broadly-representative
group from the science community. While the AAAC welcomed the re-establishment
of  the  advisory  structure  at  NASA,  we  noted  our  concern  that  dialogue  between
SMD  and  a  broadly-representative  group  from  the  science  community  is  missing  in
the new structure. The AAAC (and the community more broadly) would welcome an
evolution  of  the  current  advisory  structure  that  would  provide  more  dialogue  with

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

47

SMD  through  a  more  scientifically-diverse  group,  even  as  formal  recommendations
are channeled through the NAC to the Administrator.

Task  forces.  The  agencies  have  responded  very  supportively  to  the  AAAC’s  re-
quests  for  community-based  task  forces  to  advise  the  agencies  on  implementation
approaches  for  key  scientific  areas.  NASA’s  recent  support  for  two  interagency  ac-
tivities, the Dark Energy Task Force and the ExoPlanet Task Force was appreciated
(in addition to its earlier support for the Task Force on the Cosmic Microwave Back-
ground).  With  the  substantial  advances  on  the  ground  and  the  recognition  of  the
challenges and cost of major space missions for planet search projects like SIM and
TPF,  the  AAAC  recommended  last  year  that  NSF  and  NASA  constitute  a  Task
Force  to  develop  a  strategic  framework  for  how  to  move  forward  on  the  detection
and  characterization  of  planets  around  other  stars.  The  AAAC  greatly  appreciates
that  the  agencies  responded  positively  and  quickly;  the  ExoPlanet  Task  Force
(ExoPTF)  has  been  formed  and  has  begun  its  deliberations.  Its  report  is  expected
late  in  2007.  The  AAAC  also  welcomed  the  decision  by  SMD  last  year  to  ask  the
NRC  to  carry  out  a  study  to  determine  which  Beyond  Einstein  mission  should  go
forward if funding became available in a possible FY09/10 funding ‘‘wedge’’ as HST
SM4  is  completed  and  JWST  passes  the  peak  of  its  spending  curve.  The  selection
of three JDEM mission concept studies for conceptual development by NASA Astro-
physics,  and  the  joint  support  of  the  NRC  Beyond  Einstein  Program  Assessment
Committee (BEPAC) study by DOE were also highly welcomed by the AAAC.

National  Virtual  Observatory  (NVO).  While  this  is  a  very  small  program,  it
was  considered  to  be  of  particular  importance  in  the  2000  Decadal  Survey.  It  is  a
joint  NASA–NSF  activity.  The  agreement  on  a  joint  NASA–NSF  solicitation  for
management  of  the  NVO  operation  has  been  moving  forward  at  a  very  slow  pace,
and  the  AAAC  would  like  to  see  this  come  to  closure  to  minimize  the  disruption  to
a small but important activity.
2. What  are  your  perspectives  on  the  balance  of  the  NASA  astrophysics
program in terms of the mix of mission sizes, R&A, theory, modeling and
technology  development?  What  if  any  adjustments  are  needed  in  your
view?
A balanced program within Astrophysics has been a consistent goal of the astron-
omy community. Such a program provides the most cost-effective way to address the
great  science  issues  of  our  time.  Some  can  be  addressed  through  smaller  missions
like  COBE  and  WMAP  (the  cosmic  microwave  background),  others  require  medium
missions like Kepler (planet searches), GLAST (the gamma-ray universe) and JDEM
(dark  energy),  while  the  largest  missions  (the  Great  Observatories  like  Hubble,
Chandra,  Spitzer  and  JWST)  can  address  some  of  the  most  challenging  scientific
questions  that  cannot  be  answered  any  other  way.  The  versatility  of  such  Observ-
atories also allows them to be used for follow-up of discoveries with very little time
lag.  However,  where  the  Observatory  capabilities  cannot  address  a  particular  high-
priority science objective the relatively rapid response with small missions provides
a  means  of  doing  so.  The  last  three  astronomy  and  astrophysics  Decadal  Surveys
have  all  emphasized  the  importance  of  a  balanced  program  of  small,  medium  and
large missions, and have given particular emphasis to the Explorer program and to
a healthy program of research support (Data Analysis—DA, and Research and Anal-
ysis—R&A).

In the near-term, over the next few years, as noted above, Astrophysics will have
a range of missions including an Explorer (WISE), a Discovery mission (Kepler) and
a medium class mission (GLAST). Data Analysis (DA) funds from the ongoing Great
Observatories  are  supporting  a  very  wide  variety  of  science  objectives.  The  biggest
immediate  concern  is  the  cut  in  R&A,  which,  while  modest,  had  great  impact  be-
cause  cuts  in  a  multi-year  program  are  immediately  felt  by  the  new  or  renewing
investigators. Another concern that is also vitally important for the future of the As-
trophysics program is the current low level of technology development funding. This
gets less attention, but it is the ‘‘seed corn’’ for future missions.

However, the clouds on the horizon portend a more dismal future. The future pro-
gram  is  dominated  by  JWST  and  SOFIA,  both  of  which  are  large  programs  (in  $
terms).  As  can  be  seen  in  the  Figure  above,  the  dearth  of  small  and  medium  mis-
sions  post-2009  is  a  great  concern  for  the  vitality  of  the  field  in  the  next  decade.
The  continuing  effective  reductions  in  the  R&A  budget  (in  the  FY08  budget  and  by
inflation)  will  further  impact  the  community,  unless  the  trend  is  reversed.  As
Spitzer,  Hubble  and  Chandra  approach  the  end  of  their  lives  the  community  will
also  see  reductions  in  data  analysis  funds.  The  DA  and  R&A  funds  and  smaller-
scale missions serve a critical role in supporting the broad fabric of research needed

for  realizing  the  science  from  future  missions  and  in  enabling  the  development  of
the necessary personnel and skills.

The program is clearly unbalanced in the future beyond 2009. There are no small-
medium  Astrophysics  missions  for  many  years  after  2009.  The  first  mission  might
be a Small Explorer (SMEX) in ∼2014. The unbalance across Astrophysics is but one
aspect. There is a need for balance within the very broad areas encompassed by As-
trophysics—a  single  large  program  in  one  broad  science  area  and  only  small  mis-
sions  in  another  also  indicates  unbalance.  For  example,  searches  for  and  research
on  exoplanets  will  benefit  from  an  ensemble  of  small-to-large  missions  com-
plemented  by  ground-based  facilities.  A  broad,  systematic  cost-effective  approach  is
needed. The same could be said of a broad science program to explore our universe
from its earliest moments to the present day (Origins), and the Beyond Einstein pro-
gram. Both have very broad goals that together encompass most of the ‘‘great ques-
tions’’  within  astronomy  and  astrophysics,  and  need  a  suite  of  missions  of  different
scales to address those fundamental questions.

As  much  as  possible  it  would  be  good  to  not  have  all  our  eggs  in  one  basket—
especially  for  space  missions.  Whole  areas  of  science  could  be  drastically  undercut
if  problems  occur.  Realistically,  there  are  high  priority  science  objectives  where
there  is  no  other  way  than  by  doing  a  large  space  mission,  as  with  JWST’s  search
for the earliest galaxies in the early days of the universe. However, as much as pos-
sible,  we  should  try  to  accommodate  a  diverse  range  of  mission  and  project  scales
(and  to  give  particular  attention  to  complementing  ground-based  studies,  and  col-
laborations both with other agencies and internationally).

R&A funding needs to improve since it is essential for providing the research base
and  the  development  of  skills  on  which  future  return  from  missions  will  depend.
Funds  for  technology  development  are  needed  to  ensure  that  optimal  choices  are
made  when  selecting  missions  and  that  the  mission  options  available  are  broad.
There  is  a  crucial  need  to  encourage  and  support  technology  development  in  the
science  community,  as  well  as  at  NASA  Centers.  Core  capabilities  are  required  in
the  NASA  Centers,  but  the  Centers  might  be  encouraged  to  involve  the  academic
community  more  routinely  and  directly,  possibly  through  R&D  funding  that  sup-
ports more technology development.

I  would  give  particular  focus  on  strengthening  the  theory  and  modeling  program
in  R&A.  This  is  remarkably  inexpensive  for  its  value  to  the  scientific  enterprise.  I
am not a supporter of acquiring reams of data without concurrent theoretical devel-
opment. Results drive theoretical efforts and give them relevance, but it is a syner-
gistic  and  two-way  effort,  where  theoretical  developments  also  help  focus  observa-
tional  efforts.  It  is  crucial  to  have  the  challenge  that  comes  from  having  theory  ob-
servations confront each other, and challenge and test each other.

In summary, in my view adjustments are needed to provide a more balanced mis-
sion suit across the whole program and also within broad scientific areas, along with
support for technology development, and increased support for R&A, particularly for
theory.
3. Does  the  program,  in  your  view,  reflect  the  priorities  of  the  National
Academy of Sciences’ decadal survey for astronomy and astrophysics? If
not, where does the program diverge from the decadal survey?
As discussed above, the Astrophysics program in the near-term, does have a num-
ber  of  launches  and  a  suite  of  operating  missions,  and  so  looks  fairly  balanced  and
productive.  There  are  very  real  concerns,  however,  about  R&A  funding,  the  fre-
quency  of  small  missions  (Explorers)  and  the  very  limited  funds  for  technology  de-
velopment.  The  concern  grows  substantially  as  one  looks  further  into  the  future.
Moreover,  as  one  takes  a  longer-term  view  the  program  increasingly  moves  away
from  the  goals  of  the  Decadal  survey.  The  mission  mix  becomes  very  unbalanced.
JWST  will  be  a  remarkably  powerful  mission,  but  the  mission  suite  is  devoid  of
other space missions. SOFIA should be operating on the ground, and hopefully a Be-
yond  Einstein  program  will  be  under  development  early  in  the  decade,  but  launch
would be many years away (5–7?). An Astrophysics Small Explorer (SMEX) may be
operational  by  2014,  but  other  launch  opportunities  may  not  arise  for  years.  This
is  not  a  balanced  program,  either  scientifically  or  by  mission  scale  (small-medium-
large), and will become increasingly unbalanced as the current Great Observatories
begin  to  end  their  useful  life.  This  unbalance  will  be  accentuated  as  the  missions
launched  in  2007,  2008  and  2009  start  to  approach  their  end  of  life  towards  the
early-middle  of  the  decade.  The  lack  of  scientific  breadth  and  limited  numbers  of
operating missions will be a serious departure from the breadth of the program en-
visaged  in  the  Decadal  Survey.  This  will  be  compounded  if  the  problems  with  R&A
funding and technology development continue.

4. What  do  you  regard  as  the  top  three  risks  facing  NASA’s  astrophysics
program  over  the  next  five  years  and  how  should  those  risks  be  ad-
dressed?
The  challenge  of  dealing  with  a  reduction  and  a  dramatic  change  of  slope  in  the
Astrophysics  budget,  combined  with  recognition  of  the  costs  of  the  current  mission
suite  have  resulted  in  great  concern  about  future  opportunities  in  Astrophysics.  I
am assuming that we will develop processes that ensure that we have more realistic
cost  estimates  and  that  we  will  use  life  cycle  costs  for  programs  for  planning  and
roadmapping. I then see the top risks from a scientific perspective as:
1)  The  lack  of  small  and  medium  missions  beyond  2009.  The  dramatic  drop
in  the  small-medium  launch  rate  beyond  2009  is  a  major  concern.  The  recently  an-
nounced  Small  Explorer  SMEX  call  for  proposals  later  this  year  could  lead  to  an
opportunity  for  Astrophysics,  but  the  earliest  likely  launch  date  would  be  around
2014.  The  contrast  with  the  next  few  years,  and  with  the  early  part  of  this  decade
(when  many  small  and  medium  Explorers  were  launched)  is  dramatic.  SOFIA  will
not  reach  full  operations  until  2013.  JWST  will  be  a  superb  scientific  mission  with
wide-ranging capabilities but it alone cannot encompass the science goals of the as-
tronomy  and  astrophysics  community.  This  becomes  especially  so  since  Spitzer,
Chandra  and  Hubble  will  all  be  nearing  or  past  their  end  of  life  (Spitzer  will  lose
a  lot  of  its  science  capability  by  mid-2009  as  its  cryogen  is  exhausted).  The  risk  is
of greatly reduced scientific returns in the coming decade. An associated risk is that
of  launch  vehicle  availability  at  reasonable  cost.  This  is  a  serious  issue  for  mission
frequency if a substantial fraction of the cost of an Explorer or SMEX is the launch
vehicle cost.
2)  Inability  to  respond  to  the  2010  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Decadal
Survey.  The  funding  for  Astrophysics  drops  by  ∼25  percent  in  real  terms  around
the  time  when  the  new  Decadal  Survey  is  released  and  so  the  opportunities  for
ramping-up on the recommended missions will be quite limited. The Decadal Survey
will  be  discussing  and  making  recommendations  on  many  high  priority  programs
that  have  been  under  development  or  discussion  for  some  time.  For  example,  Con-
X, LISA, SIM, TPF and SAFIR will all be discussed, as well as a variety of Einstein
Probe  missions  that  are  being  considered  in  the  current  BEPAC  study.  The  AAAC
ExoPlanet Task Force will likely identify additional areas for development and mis-
sions. Some hard choices face the community in the upcoming Decadal Survey. The
natural  outcome  of  the  more  realistic  costing  that  will  be  part  of  the  next  Decadal
Survey  will  be  a  reduced  program,  better  matched  to  the  available  funding.  How-
ever,  the  lack  of  a  significant  funding  opportunity  will  limit  the  ability  to  initiate
a strong effort following the survey. This translates to a risk of significantly dimin-
ished  scientific  returns  on  the  highest-priority  science  questions  of  the  decade.  The
next generation of missions will also be at risk if technology development cannot be
initiated because of the same funding problems.
3)  The  current  lack  of  technology  development  and  mission  development
funding and its impact on mission costs and readiness. The very limited fund-
ing available in recent times has severely limited the technology development efforts
for  both  current  missions  in  early  development  (like  Con-X  and  LISA,  and  now
TPF),  and  also  more  innovative  and  speculative  technologies  for  future  opportuni-
ties.  This  will  have  far-reaching  implications  for  mission  opportunities  in  the  next
decade and is significant risk to future astrophysics missions and competed opportu-
nities. It also increases the risks of cost growth if conceptual development and tech-
nology development have been unable to progress steadily.

These areas are identified as risk areas because of two problems. The first is the
dramatic  change  in  the  budget  situation  for  Astrophysics  over  the  next  few  years,
particularly  the  cuts  in  FY09  and  beyond.  Second,  the  poor  cost  estimates  in  the
past  have  exacerbated  our  current  problems.  The  agency  and  community  together
did not deal very well with the cost estimates and budgets of the missions and pro-
grams  that  we  jointly  developed.  However,  it  is  my  view  that  this  situation  has
changed  dramatically  with  the  much  more  realistic  and  open  approach  of  the  new
Administrator and with a more sophisticated and realistic view of project costs and
the  costs  over  the  life  cycle  of  missions  by  the  community  and  the  Agency.  While
I  think  we  are  now  working  to  deal  collectively  with  the  undercosting  problem,  a
solution to the budget problem for science is a more challenging concern for the fu-
ture. If we are to have a strong, productive and broadly-based science program, ad-
ditional  funding  is  needed.  Recognition  is  needed  that  NASA  science  plays  a  role
as  important  as  that  of  DOE  science,  NSF  and  NIST  in  the  Nation’s  science  enter-
prise.

5. If you could make three strategic investments that could benefit the as-
trophysics  program  over  the  long-term,  what  would  those  investments
be?
Strategic investments are key to positioning the Astrophysics Division, the astron-
omy  and  astrophysics  community,  the  NASA  Centers  and  industry  partners  to  be
able to extend the limits of scientific endeavor and scientific understanding. To meet
the  science  goals  of  the  community,  NASA  and  the  community  need  to  be  able  to
move forward on a variety of missions from large Flagship missions to medium and
smaller scale missions, while returning cutting-edge science results from the current
missions. I think the following three areas would be excellent strategic investments
to  position  the  Agency  and  the  community  for  a  cost-effective  program  of  science
missions.  The  first  two  are  relatively  low  cost  (though  still  very  difficult  to  fund  in
the  current  budget  environment),  while  even  the  third  could  be  carried  out  in  an
Astrophysics budget that is constant at the FY06 dollar level.
1)  R&A  funding  is  a  strategic  investment.  This  is  particularly  so  for  theory,
modeling  and  cutting-edge  technology  development  to  complement  mission  specific
data  analysis.  Clearly  R&A  and  mission-specific  DA  maximizes  the  science  return
from  current  programs  and  also  maximizes  the  ‘‘return  on  investment’’  in  space
science.  Support  for  such  activities  is  also  a  strategic  investment  from  NASA’s  per-
spective. A key aspect of an implementable long-range plan is knowing what are key
science  questions,  why  they  are  important,  and  whether  answering  them  is  doable.
Exploiting  current  data,  along  with  theory  allows  us  to  set  science  priorities.  Fur-
thermore,  exploring  novel  technologies  and  strengthening  the  technological  base
amongst graduate students and postdoctoral researchers is an investment for the fu-
ture.
2) Technology development for missions. Astrophysics missions utilize state-of-
art  technology,  and  it  is  essential  that  that  technology  be  developed  and  dem-
onstrated  to  flight  readiness  levels  before  a  mission  enters  construction.  Retiring
technological risk early helps to minimize the likelihood of cost growth. There is an-
other  aspect  as  well.  The  science  community  must  make  strategic  choices  on  how
to  spend  limited  funds  as  wisely  and  effectively  as  possible.  For  this  to  happen  we
must understand the level of risks and costs at the time we undertake our Decadal
Surveys. We cannot afford to have moderate scale missions at the few hundred mil-
lion dollar level grow into multi-billion dollar programs. Modest (by comparison with
the  final  costs)  expenditures  on  technology  development  and  on  establishing  a
strong  science  and  management  team  early  in  the  planning  and  development  proc-
ess would be money very well spent.
3)  Competed,  cost-capped  missions.  These  missions,  at  the  medium  scale  (Ein-
stein  and  Origins  Probes—like  New  Frontiers),  along  with  the  smaller  Explorers
and  Discovery-class  missions  have  a  valuable  role.  Having  been  a  strong  proponent
of large ‘‘Flagship’’ missions (through personally spending a great deal of my career
working  to  make  Hubble  a  success  and  NGST—now  JWST—a  reality  in  its  early
years)  I  do  not  want  to  downplay  the  central  role  that  large  missions  play  in  the
Astrophysics  science  enterprise.  Flagships,  however,  are  rare  and  it  is  essential  for
the  vitality  of  the  field  for  frequent  launch  opportunities  at  the  medium  and  small
scale.  Cost-capped,  competed  missions  have  many  attractive  features  (e.g.,  focused
science  opportunities,  community  involvement,  responsive  to  more  current  science
goals,  controls  on  cost-growth).  However,  heavy  reliance  on  such  quick  response,
‘‘bottom-up’’  missions  may  undercut  the  benefits  of  strategic  planning  through  the
Decadal Survey. This can be rectified if the Decadal Survey gives guidance on broad
areas  that  the  community  sees  as  important  and  ready  for  investigation  (e.g.,
searches for planets around other stars—exoplanets; the early universe; dark matter
and  dark  energy).  A  additional  major  concern  for  such  missions  could  be  the  cost
of  launch  vehicles  with  the  demise  of  the  Delta  2  launchers.  This  has  the  potential
to be a serious issue for the small-medium scale missions.

As noted, an Astrophysics budget that is constant in FY06 dollars, with the FY06
base, could accommodate all these recommendations. Any growth as part of the leg-
islative  Innovation  and  Competitiveness  agency  would  enable,  for  example,  a  new
large Flagship mission in the next decade as well.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Doctor.
Dr. Baker.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  DANIEL  N.  BAKER,  DIRECTOR,  LABORA-
TORY FOR ATMOSPHERIC AND SPACE PHYSICS, UNIVERSITY
OF COLORADO, BOULDER
Dr. BAKER. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee,  I  want  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
address the impacts of the proposed fiscal year 2008 budget on the
NASA program and heliophysics.

In  addition  to  my  roles  at  the  University  of  Colorado,  I  am  also
the  Chair  of  the  National  Research  Council’s  Committee  on  Solar
and Space Physics, and a member of its parent body, the RC Space
Studies Board.

Part of the views I express today are my own.

55

Let  me  begin  by  thanking  you  for  your  continuing  and  substan-
tial  support  for  NASA  science.  We  in  the  science  community  sin-
cerely  appreciate  the  support,  and  fully  recognize  the  difficulty  of
funding NASA science in a constrained budget environment.

Heliophysics division at NASA has a number of exciting missions
that  have  been  launched  recently.  Stereo,  NODI  and  DEMES  are
already  providing  remarkable  new  measurements.  Because  of  our
large  role  in  the  program,  we  at  LASP  are  very  excited  and  proud
of  the  successful  launch  just  last  week  for  the  upper  atmospheric
AIM spacecraft as part of the Explorer program.

However, beginning with the fiscal year 2005 NASA budget plan,
and continuing through the fiscal year 2008 budget in its five year
run  out,  the  future  heliophysics  program  has  been  significantly
compromised.  For  example,  the  solar  terrestrial  probes,  or  STP
line,  has  had  over  half  of  its  budget  content  removed,  resulting  in
at  least  a  six  year  gap  in  STP  launches.  A  highly  successful  Ex-
plorer  mission  line  has  had  over  $1  billion  of  budget  authority  re-
moved in the run out from the fiscal year 2005 budget onward.

As  shown  in  the  figure  here,  the  Explorer  budget  in  the  fiscal
year  2008  plan  is  about  half  of  what  would  have  been  expected,
based  on  the  fiscal  year  2004  budget,  which  greatly  reduces  our
ability  to  respond  effectively  to  new  science  and  technology  ad-
vances.  Noted  by  others,  the  sounding  rocket  program,  and  indeed
the  entire  sub-orbital  program  is  also  at  a  dangerously  low  bare
bones resource level.

In  the  fiscal  year  2008  budget  plan,  the  space  weather  oriented
living  with  the  STAR  program  also  sees  its  funding  stretched  out
so that it substantially—missions have been reduced, and the radi-
ation  belt  storm  probes  and  atmosphere/thermosphere  probes
have—no 
longer  have  simultaneity.  Alarmingly,  and  rather
inexplicably,  the  previously  budgeted  funding  for  the  RBSP  mis-
sions of opportunity is eliminated in the fiscal year 2008 plan.

In  response  to  your  questions  about  my  perspectives  on  the  bal-
ance of the NASA heliophysics program and its mix of program ele-
ments,  I  must  say  that  considerable  anxiety  exists  in  the  science
community  due  to  anticipated  reductions  in  the  smaller  missions
and  sustaining  research  programs  that  perform  the  support  for
much of the community based research.

I  am  delighted  that  Dr.  Stern  is  taking  actions  now  to  remedy
the  sub-orbital  situation.  I  am  also  encouraged  by  the  fact  that  a
new  announcement  of  opportunity  for  small  explorers  will  be  re-
leased,  thanks  to  Dr.  Stern  and  his  team,  by  October  2007.  There
is  widespread  recognition  as  well  that  R&A  cuts  are  harmful  and
will  inevitably  reduce  the  number  of  new  students  who  enter  uni-
versity programs. This definitely needs to be addressed.

As for how the heliophysics program reflects the priorities of the
decadal  survey  in  solar  and  space  physics,  NASA  is  attempting  to
implement  some  of  the  highest  priority  programs  from  the  2003
survey,  but  the  pace  and  balance  of  activity  seems  highly  unlikely
to achieve the decadal goals. It now appears that with mission cost
growth  and  reduced  heliophysics  funding  it  is  very  unlikely  that
most survey missions will be completed within the decadal window.
The three top risks facing the heliophysics program over the next
five years, in my opinion, are first, fear of failure. There is a proper

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

level  of  redundancy,  scrutiny  and  oversight  that  matches  the  risk
of  a  robotic  mission  failure,  and  balances  that  with  the  program’s
scale.  To  do  more  than  this  due  diligence  drives  costs  for  even
small end missions out to extraordinary heights. I fear this is para-
lyzing the space science program at present, this fear of failure.

Lack  of  affordable  access  to  space  is  the  second.  Unfortunately,
the  cost  of  launching  missions  into  space  has  grown  out  of  all  pro-
portion  to  the  cost  of  small  scientific  payloads  and  satellites.  This
imbalance  is  destroying  the  ability  of  the  heliophysics  to  develop
and  maintain  a  regular  and  frequent  launch  of  all  class  submis-
sions.

The third risk is the erosion of trained work force. The NRC has
recently  issued  a  report  on  the  NASA  work  force,  and  it  confirms
my view that NASA needs to invest in space science programs that
allow  universities  to  attract  and  engage  undergraduate  and  grad-
uate  students  in  all  aspects  of  mission  development  and  deploy-
ment.

Finally,  the  top  three  investments  that  could  be  made  to  benefit
the heliophysics program over the long-term are, first, I would say,
lower costs and frequent access to space. Congress and other stake-
holders  should  work  together  to  make  sure  that  every  avenue  for
launching  space  hardware  is  made  readily  available  to  research
teams.

In this category of access to space I would also place missions of
opportunity.  Launching  NASA  instruments  or  payload  suites  on
commercial  or  foreign  spacecraft  can  provide  tremendous  bang  for
the buck.

Secondly,  would  be  a  regular  cadence  and  more  frequent  small
end  missions.  This  echoes  what  other  speakers  have  said.  The  key
to a healthy, robust heliophysics program is to have more and bet-
ter  opportunities  for  small  explorer,  university  class  explorer  and
sub-orbital missions.

Investment  necessary  to  achieve  the  desired  outcome  in  this
arena could be readily accomplished, I believe, by restoring the Ex-
plorer mission line to the budgetary level that existed in the fiscal
year 2004 budget plan. It was about $350 million per year.

Finally, and I can’t stress this strongly enough, is improved man-
agement  of  mission  costs.  I  believe  that  heliophysics  should  invest
time  and  money  now  into  developing  an  approach  to  mission  man-
agement  that  uses  prudent  levels  of  reviews  and  much  wiser  risk
mitigation strategies.

Thank  you  very  much  for  your  attention.  I  look  forward  to  an-

swering questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DANIEL N. BAKER

Introduction

Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Minority  Member,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I
want  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  today  to  address  key  issues  that  face  the
NASA science enterprise. I want specifically to address the impacts of the proposed
FY 2008 budget on the NASA Heliophysics program. My name is Daniel Baker and
I  am  a  Professor  of  astrophysical  and  planetary  sciences  at  the  University  of  Colo-
rado.  I  am  also  the  Director  of  the  Laboratory  for  Atmospheric  and  Space  Physics
at  CU–Boulder.  The  Laboratory  is  a  research  institute  that  has  over  60  teaching
and research faculty in the several disciplines of space and Earth sciences. My insti-
tute,  which  we  call  LASP  for  short,  receives  some  $50–$60  million  per  year  to  sup-

port  experimental,  theoretical,  and  data  analysis  programs  in  the  Space  and  Earth
Sciences.  The  vast  majority  of  these  resources  come  from  NASA.  Other  strong  sup-
port  comes  from  NSF,  NOAA,  and  other  federal  agencies.  LASP  presently  supports
some  120  engineers,  dozens  of  highly  skilled  technicians,  and  over  20  key  support
personnel.  We  are  very  proud,  as  well,  that  LASP  has  over  60  graduate  students
and  another  60  undergraduate  students  who  are  pursuing  education  and  training
goals in space science and engineering.

I myself am a space plasma physicist and I have served as a principal investigator
on several scientific programs of NASA. I am now a lead investigator in the upcom-
ing Radiation Belt Storm Probe (RBSP) mission that is part of NASA’s Living With
a Star program. I am also an investigator on NASA’s Cluster, Polar, MESSENGER,
and Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) missions. Presently, I serve as Chair of the
National  Research  Council’s  Committee  on  Solar  and  Space  Physics.  By  virtue  of
that  position,  I  also  am  a  member  of  the  Space  Studies  Board,  chaired  by  my  col-
league, Dr. Len Fisk. The views I am presenting here are my own, however.

First,  and  foremost,  I  would  like  to  begin  by  commending  the  American  people,
and  you  as  their  representatives,  for  the  significant  investment  made  in  NASA
science. The scientific community is well aware of how difficult it has become to find
funding for the many worthy programs that you must consider. We sincerely appre-
ciate  continued  support  from  Congress  and  from  the  American  public.  It  is  a  major
and  lasting  achievement  of  our  nation  that  it  finds  the  means  and  the  will  to  look
beyond the pressure of present-day concerns, to focus on questions about humanity’s
place  in  the  universe,  our  relationship  to  our  Sun  and  the  nearby  planets,  how  the
Earth  and  its  environment  have  functioned  in  the  past,  and  how  they  may  change
in the future. I believe—as do you, I suspect—that the United States has benefited
greatly from investment in space research. Not only is the technological base of our
country strengthened by NASA innovations, but our prestige and competitiveness in
the  world  and  our  educational  investment  in  the  future  technical  workforce  are
greatly enhanced by NASA science leadership.
Overview of FY 2008 Budget Impacts to the Heliophysics Program

The  National  Research  Council’s  (NRC’s)  2003  Solar  and  Space  Physics  (SSP)
Decadal  Survey,  The  Sun  to  the  Earth—and  Beyond:  A  Decadal  Strategy  for  Solar
and Space Physics, laid out a clear, prudent, and effective program of basic and ap-
plied  research.  The  envisioned  program  would  address  key  science  objectives  such
as:  understanding  magnetic  reconnection—the  physical  process  underlying  much  of
space physics; discovering the mechanisms that drive the Sun’s activity and produce
energetic  particle  storms  in  the  heliosphere;  determining  the  physical  interactions
of  the  Earth’s  ionosphere  with  the  atmosphere  and  magnetosphere;  as  well  as  ad-
dressing  a  host  of  other  questions  that  are  essential  to  understanding  our  local
space  environment.  The  Decadal  Plan  would  also  have  allowed  an  end-to-end  view
of  the  connected  Sun-Earth  system  through  NASA’s  Living  With  a  Star  (LWS)  pro-
gram,  thereby  enhancing  greatly  the  ability  to  provide  realistic  specification  and
forecasts  of  space  weather.  Through  both  its  basic  research  component  and  its  ap-
plied component, the Heliophysics Program would therefore contribute substantially
and directly to national needs and to the Vision for Space Exploration.

At  present,  the  Heliophysics  Division  (HPD)  of  NASA  has  a  number  of  exciting
projects  that  have  been  launched  or  are  ready  for  launch.  The  dual-spacecraft
STEREO mission is being commissioned and is returning amazing new three-dimen-
sional views of the Heliosphere. Detailed images of the Sun are also being provided
by  the  newly-launched  Hinode  mission,  a  joint  Japan-U.S.  venture.  The  five-space-
craft  THEMIS  mission  was  successfully  launched  in  February  2007  and  is  already
providing remarkable multi-point measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere. Because
of  our  large  role  in  the  program,  we  at  LASP  are  very  excited  about  the  successful
launch  just  last  week  of  the  upper  atmospheric  AIM  spacecraft  as  part  of  the  Ex-
plorer program. The first LWS mission, Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), is well
into development preparing for launch in 2008. Thus, the HPD program has several
highly capable new space assets that are joining the Heliophysics Great Observatory
constellation of operating spacecraft.

Beyond  this  good  news,  however,  there  are  significant  concerns.  Beginning  with
the  FY  2005  NASA  budget  plan,  and  continuing  through  the  FY  2008  budget  and
its  five-year  run-out,  the  future  Heliophysics  program  has  been  significantly  com-
promised.  The  Solar-Terrestrial  Probes  (STP)  line  of  missions  has  had  over  half  of
its  budget  content  removed,  resulting  in  at  least  a  six-year  gap  in  STP  launches.
Within  the  current  NASA  budget  horizon  extending  to  2015,  the  STP  line  is  now
down  to  a  single  mission  launch,  the  Magnetospheric  Multi-Scale  (MMS)  mission.
The venerable and highly successful Explorer mission line (managed by HPD for all
of  NASA)  has  had  over  $1  billion  of  budget  authority  removed  in  the  run-out  from

FY 2005 onward. As shown in the figure below, the Explorer budgets in the FY 2008
and  its  run-out  are  about  half  of  what  they  would  have  been  expected  to  be  based
on the FY 2004 budget and its run-out.

As Principal Investigator (PI)-led missions with a rapid development time, Explor-
ers have proven invaluable for investigating the broad range of Heliophysics science.
The  drastic  funding  reduction  in  this  line  has  greatly  reduced  HPD’s  ability  to  re-
spond  effectively  to  new  science/technology  advances.  The  sounding  rocket  program
(and, indeed, the entire sub-orbital program) is at a dangerously low, bare-bones re-
source  level.  The  Research  and  Analysis  (R&A)  program  was  deeply  cut  last  year
and  no  funding  restorations  seem  likely  at  present.  The  impact  of  these  cuts  will
be felt for many years since R&A, Explorers, and Sub-orbital programs are key ele-
ments  in  capitalizing  on  the  investments  that  have  already  been  made  and  for  at-
tracting  and  training  the  next  generation  of  space  scientists  and  engineers.  More-
over, the high priority ‘‘Flagship’’ mission for Heliophysics, the Solar Probe Mission,
is not presently contained in NASA’s plan.1

The  other  major  component  of  the  Heliophysics  program  is  Living  with  a  Star
(LWS). The funding profile for LWS as defined by the FY 2005 and FY 2006 budgets
allowed for a robust program. In the FY 2008 budget plans, however, LWS funding
is stretched out so that simultaneity between missions such as Radiation Belt Storm
Probes (RBSP) and Ionosphere-Thermosphere Storm Probes is lost. Alarmingly, and
rather  inexplicably,  the  previously-budgeted  funding  for  the  RBSP  Missions  of  Op-
portunity is eliminated from the FY 2008 plan. Such reductions to LWS are threat-
ening  the  success  of  the  immediate  program  as  well  as  the  timely  implementation
of missions such as Sentinels, which are necessary to fulfill the President’s 2004 Vi-
sion  for  Space  Exploration.  These  reductions  are  impeding  progress  in  under-
standing  the  origins  of  the  severe  space  weather  events  that  have  the  potential  to
disrupt  civil  and  military  satellite  communications,  applications  that  rely  on  the

1 The  Solar  Probe  mission  was  the  highest  priority  large-class  mission  in  the  NRC  solar  and
space  physics  decadal  survey.  An  early  start  of  Solar  Probe  would  have  required  resources  be-
yond those anticipated at the time the survey was completed; however, the anticipated budgets
supported  a  start  in  FY  2010.  Long  a  priority  of  the  heliophysics  community,  the  Solar  Probe
mission  promises  to  revolutionize  our  knowledge  of  the  physics  of  the  origin  and  evolution  of
the solar wind. Moreover, by making the only direct, in-situ measurements of the region where
some  of  the  deadliest  solar  energetic  particles  are  energized,  Solar  Probe  would  make  unique
and fundamental contributions to our ability to characterize and forecast the radiation environ-
ment in which future space explorers will work and live.

Global  Positioning  System  (GPS),  and  power  generation  and  transmission  systems.
Given the large investments that NASA will make to fulfill the Vision for Space Ex-
ploration  and  the  investments  that  the  Nation,  as  a  whole,  is  increasingly  making
in  space-based  technology,  it  seems  ill-considered  to  decrease  support  for  LWS,  the
NASA  program  that  is  most  closely  directed  toward  protecting  those  investments.2
To be sure, some of the fiscal problems in Heliophysics and elsewhere are related
to  mission  cost  growth.  Much  of  this  problem,  however,  lies  in  non-technical  issues
that the science community and the Decadal Survey could not have anticipated, in-
cluding substantial increases in launch vehicle costs, the effects of full-cost account-
ing, and mandates for additional layers of oversight and review. As noted above, the
problems  with  the  Heliophysics  program  started  well  before  the  FY  2008  budget
plan, but the trends have been perpetuated in the FY 2008 budget and its five-year
run-out.
Specific Questions Concerning Heliophysics

I  present  here  my  detailed  answers  to  the  questions  addressed  to  me  by  the

Chairman in his letter of 11 April 2007:
1. Perspective on the balance of the NASA Heliophysics program and its mix of pro-

gram elements.
Considerable  anxiety  is  being  caused  in  the  science  community  due  to  the  antici-
pated  and  extraordinary  reductions  in  the  smaller  mission  opportunities  and  sus-
taining  research  programs  that  form  the  support  for  much  of  the  university-based
research (in which students and early-career scientist are involved). Small missions,
such as those in the Explorer and Earth System Science Pathfinders programs, pro-
vide  projects  in  which  new  concepts  are  tested  for  a  modest  investment  and  where
students  first  learn  the  space  science  and  engineering  trade.  This  particularly  ap-
plies to sounding rockets, balloons, and aircraft flights that provide opportunities on
a  time  scale  that  falls  within  the  educational  horizon  of  a  graduate  student.  Since
2000,  the  historical  sounding  rocket  launch  rate  has  dropped  more  than  half  (from
about  30  to  10  missions  per  year),  with  anticipated  further  reductions  as  a  result
of  the  FY  2008  budget.  The  present  run-out  budget  places  even  the  regular  launch
facilities, such as those at Poker Flat in Alaska, in danger by 2008. Staff reductions
may be necessary at the Wallops Island Flight Facility in a matter of months if ad-
ditional  funds  are  not  forthcoming  to  the  sounding  rocket  program.  I  am  delighted
that Dr. Alan Stern, the new Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Associate Adminis-
trator, is taking actions now to remedy the sub-orbital situation.

The  Explorer  program  is  another  prime  example  of  the  severe  impacts  in  the
Heliophysics  program.  Explorers  are  the  original  science  missions  of  NASA,  dating
back  to  the  very  first  U.S.  satellite,  Explorer  I.  They  are  universally  recognized  as
the most successful science projects at NASA, providing insights into both the most
remote  parts  of  our  universe  and  the  detailed  dynamics  of  our  local  space  environ-
ment.  The  Advanced  Composition  Explorer  (ACE)  now  stands  as  our  sentinel  to
measure, in-situ, large mass ejections from the Sun and the energetic particles that
are  a  danger  to  humans  in  space.  Two  relatively  recent  Explorers,  TRACE  and
RHESSI, study the dynamics of the solar corona where large solar storms originate,
storms that often threaten satellites and other technological assets on which we de-
pend. The recently launched THEMIS constellation and the AIM mission were both
done  under  the  Explorer  program  aegis.  Explorers  are  among  the  most  competitive
solicitations  in  NASA  science,  and  offer  opportunities  for  all  researchers  to  propose
new  and  exciting  ideas  that  are  selected  on  the  basis  of  science  content,  relation  to
overall  NASA  strategic  goals,  and  feasibility  of  execution.  As  noted  in  the  figure
above, the FY 2008 proposed run-out for Explorers will mean a program that is re-
duced  by  over  half  from  its  proposed  FY  2004  guidelines.  I  am  again  encouraged
by  the  fact  that  a  new  Announcement  of  Opportunity  for  Small  Explorers  will  be
released, thanks to Dr. Stern, by October 2007.

A  specific  continuing  concern  to  university-based  scientists  is  the  impact  on  the
sustaining Research and Analysis (R&A) budgets. The R&A program initiates many
of  the  new,  small  scientific  efforts  that  eventually  lead  to  the  major  missions  that
NASA  pursues.  R&A  grants  are  highly  competitive,  maximize  the  science  invest-
ment  of  on-going  missions  by  allowing  all  scientists  to  use  available  data,  and  are
heavily geared toward student and young faculty participation. These are moderate-

of geomagnetic storms to the electric power industry alone were approximately $450 million over
three  years.  See,  ‘‘Solar  Storms  Cause  Significant  Economic  and  other  Impacts  on  Earth,’’  and

duration efforts, usually lasting three to four years, where new hardware and theo-
retical  approaches  are  explored.  NASA  was  forced  last  year  by  budget  realities  to
propose an across-the-board reduction of 15 percent in these programs. This may not
appear  catastrophic  at  first  sight,  but  a  sudden  reduction  in  such  a  long-term  pro-
gram can have huge effects. If the budget were allowed to grow once again, the R&A
program  would  slowly  recover  over  the  next  few  years.  However,  with  the  present
budget  prospects,  there  is  skepticism  about  such  future  restoration.  There  is  wide-
spread recognition that these realities will inevitably reduce the number of new stu-
dents who enter university programs such as mine.
2. Does  the  Heliophysics  program  reflect  the  priorities  of  the  NRC  Decadal  Survey

in solar and space physics?
Whereas NASA is attempting to implement some of the highest priority programs
from the NRC’s 2003 Decadal Survey, the pace and balance of activities seems high-
ly  unlikely  to  achieve  the  Decadal  goals.  In  2004,  an  NRC  committee  was  tasked
to  assess  the  role  of  solar  and  space  physics  in  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration—
Solar  and  Space  Physics  and  Its  Role  in  Space  Exploration.  This  committee  stated
that:

NASA’s Heliophysics program depends upon a balanced portfolio of space flight
missions  and  of  supporting  programs  and  infrastructure.  There  are  two  stra-
tegic  mission  lines—Living  With  a  Star  (LWS)  and  Solar-Terrestrial  Probes
(STP)—and  a  coordinated  set  of  supporting  programs.  LWS  missions  focus  on
observing  the  solar  activity,  from  short-term  dynamics  to  long-term  evolution,
that  can  affect  the  Earth,  as  well  as  astronauts  working  and  living  in  a  near-
Earth space environment. Solar-Terrestrial Probes are focused on exploring the
fundamental physical processes of plasma interactions in the solar system.

Solar  and  Space  Physics  and  Its  Role  in  Exploration  examined  the  2003  Decadal

Survey and made the following three recommendations:

1. To  achieve  the  goals  of  the  exploration  vision  there  must  be  a  robust  pro-
gram,  including  both  the  LWS  and  the  STP  mission  lines,  that  studies  the
heliospheric  system  as  a  whole  and  that  incorporates  a  balance  of  applied
and basic science.

2. The programs that underpin the LWS and STP mission lines—MO&DA [Mis-
sion Operations and Data Analysis], Explorers, the sub-orbital program, and
SR&T [Supporting Research and Technology]—should continue at a pace and
level  that  will  ensure  that  they  can  fill  their  vital  roles  in  Heliophysics  re-
search.

3. The near-term priority and sequence of solar, heliospheric, and geospace mis-
sions  should  be  maintained  as  recommended  in  the  Decadal  Survey  report
both for scientific reasons and for the purposes of the exploration vision.

These  recommendations  remain  valid  today  and  the  mission  priorities  within  the
basic (STP) and applied (LWS) science mission lines as listed in the original Decadal
Survey  are  basically  reflected  in  the  Heliophysics  budgets  for  these  two  mission
lines.  Where  NASA  has  deviated  from  the  Decadal  Survey  is  in  putting  greater
weight on Living With a Star missions and losing the balance between applied and
basic  science.  Such  a  priority  of  emphasizing  short-term  capability  of  predicting
space  weather  over  the  long-term  goal  of  understanding  the  underlying  physical
principles may have some practical expedience. A more critical issue, however, is the
fact that small missions and supporting research have not kept pace. If these budg-
ets are allowed to decline greatly, Heliophysics will quickly cease to be a robust, via-
ble  discipline.  It  now  appears  that  with  mission  cost  growth  and  reduced
Heliophysics funding, it is very unlikely that most Decadal Survey missions will be
completed within the decadal window.

The Sun to the Earth—and Beyond was the first Decadal Survey conducted by the
solar  and  space  physics  community.  The  Decadal  Survey  involved  hundreds  of  sci-
entists in discussions that spanned nearly two years. The scientific priorities set out
in  the  survey  remain  valid  today  and  there  is  no  community  movement  to  change
them.  But  Decadal  Surveys  are  not  just  a  list  of  science  priorities.  To  design  a  co-
herent  program  across  a  decade  it  is  essential  to  have  a  realistic  budget  profile  as
well  as  reasonably  accurate  estimates  of  both  technical  readiness  and  costs  of  each
mission.  The  Decadal  Survey  committee  worked  hard  with  engineers  and  NASA
management  to  develop  realistic  mission  costs  and  a  program  architecture  that  fit
within budget profiles anticipated in the FY 2003 budget. But changes to the budget
profile  beginning  in  FY  2005  necessitated  a  substantial  stretching  of  the  mission
schedule. Furthermore, under-costing of just a few missions wreak havoc with even

61

the best-laid plans. The scientific community needs to work with NASA to find ways
to cost missions accurately, particularly large missions (for example, by applying les-
sons  learned  from  management  of  smaller,  PI-led  missions  as  appropriate,  and  in-
sisting upon greater accountability).
3. What  are  the  three  top  risks  facing  the  Heliophysics  program  over  the  next  five

years?
Heliophysics, like most of the NASA science enterprise, is significantly affected by
some  very  basic,  systemic  issues.  These  issues  spread  throughout  all  programs,
projects,  and  missions.  A  continued  forward  propagation  of  these  problems  ulti-
mately  represents  a  huge  level  of  risk  for  the  sub-disciplines  of  the  SMD  and  for
the Agency as a whole:
• Prudent Management of Risk. Getting into space, working in space (either for
humans  or  for  machines),  and  returning  appropriate  data  from  space  is  an  inher-
ently  ‘‘risky’’  business.  Despite  highly  competent  people  exercising  all  sensible  and
prudent care, there can be failures of space missions. For those programs involving
humans and human life, truly heroic measures must be employed and extraordinary
efforts  must  be  extended  to  assure  that  missions  do  not  fail:  In  the  human  space
flight realm, failure is not an option.

In the robotic exploration realm, there are a wide range of mission sizes and costs.
Very large, high-profile missions of great complexity, international prominence, and
resource investment may have to be safeguarded by many levels of review and hard-
ware  redundancy.  Such  approaches  tend  to  drive  up  program  costs  tremendously.
However,  for  smaller  missions,  there  is  a  proper  level  of  redundancy,  scrutiny,  and
oversight  that  matches  the  program  scale.  To  do  more  than  this  ‘‘due  diligence’’
drives costs for even small-end missions to extraordinary levels. Such fear of failure,
or undue ‘‘risk aversion’’ is having very detrimental effects on Heliophysics missions.
What  we  really  need  to  focus  on  is  the  management  of  risk.  Since  the  first  Ex-
plorer,  almost  50  years  ago,  NASA  science  projects  have  been  extraordinarily  suc-
cessful. But over the years, the management procedures and quality assurance bur-
den  for  robotic  science  projects  has  grown  to  an  almost  unsustainable  level—com-
mensurate  with  human  space  flight  missions—without  any  quantifiable  impact  on
improving the ultimate reliability of science missions (as far as many scientists can
discern).  In  my  view,  the  American  people  accept  the  idea  that  the  space  business
is  risky,  especially  during  launch  and  re-entry.  Given  launch  risks,  it  makes  no
sense to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on procedures that might improve the
reliability of payloads far beyond, say, the 98 percent or 99 percent reliability level.
There  is  considerable  debate  whether  present  reliability  approaches  are  actually
achieving  more  assurance  than  this.  We  have  all  learned  that  unnecessary  risk  in
human  space  flight  programs  has  tragic  consequences  and  clearly  more  must  be
done  to  minimize  that  risk.  It  is  equally  true  that  not  taking  risks  in  leading-edge
robotic  science  projects  has  undesirable  results.  Not  only  must  science  continue  to
push the technological envelope where failure is a risk that accompanies new ideas,
but  these  projects  provide  opportunities  for  training  staff  and  students  in  an  envi-
ronment where failure is not life-threatening, and where a student can gain hands-
on  experience  in  the  real  work  of  building  state-of-the  art  instrumentation.  Having
gained this expertise, these students can go on to form the workforce of future oper-
ational robotic science missions and human space flight missions.
• Lack of affordable access to space. A major hallmark of the past science pro-
gram  of  NASA  has  been  the  regular,  frequent  launches  of  a  balanced  portfolio  of
small, medium, and large missions to address key science questions and to test new
enabling  technologies.  ‘‘Balance’’  in  this  context  does  not  mean  equal  dollars  in  all
mission  categories,  but  rather  it  means  appropriate  investment  in  small-end  mis-
sions targeted toward specific science questions and toward workforce development,
as  well  as  investments  in  major  flagship  programs.  In  my  view,  there  should  be
heavy emphasis on smaller spacecraft and sub-orbital missions. (This idea has been
endorsed  by  last  year’s  NRC  report  An  Assessment  of  Balance  in  NASA’s  Science
Programs).

Unfortunately, the cost of launching missions into space has grown out of all pro-
portion  to  the  cost  of  small  scientific  satellites  and  payloads.  This  imbalance  be-
tween  payloads  and  launch  costs  is  destroying  the  ability  of  the  Heliophysics  Divi-
sion to develop and maintain its regular, frequent launches of Small Explorers, Uni-
versity-Class Explorers, and even Solar-Terrestrial Probe missions. The risks associ-
ated  with  increasing  costs  of  access  to  space,  in  my  view,  are  threatening  to  sink
the entire carefully-laid plans for Heliophysics science.

There  are  some  disturbing  recent  signs  in  the  access  to  space  arena.  One  of  the
longest-serving  launch  vehicles  for  NASA  missions,  the  Boeing  Delta  II  vehicle,  is

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

62

being  eliminated  as  an  option  for  future  science  programs.  Much  of  the  NASA  me-
dium-lift needs for Earth-orbiting and planetary missions was carried out using the
Delta  II.  Losing  the  ‘‘sweet  spot’’  around  which  so  many  NASA  launches  were
planned  will,  I  fear,  propagate  in  highly  detrimental  ways  throughout  the  space
science enterprise.

I have also mentioned above the removal of funding for the RBSP Missions of Op-
portunity.  It  is  hard  to  imagine  a  more  cost-effective  investment  that  NASA  can
make  than  to  launch  instruments  on  commercial  or  partner-nation  spacecraft.  For
a relatively small NASA investment, the science enterprise gains access to a highly
leveraged  program  and  can  often  provide  a  complementary  science  capability  that
lends  a  robustness  and  insurance  that  could  not  be  afforded  any  other  way.  I  am
very encouraged that Dr. Stern has voiced strong public support for MoOs.
• Erosion  of  trained  workforce.  A  key  to  the  success  of  NASA  as  a  whole,  and
Heliophysics  in  particular,  is  the  availability  of  hardware-educated  scientists  and
‘‘hands-on’’ trained engineers. Nearly all space projects require a great deal of tech-
nical  competence,  and  a  correspondingly  competent  workforce.  There  has  been  a
steady  erosion  of  that  workforce,  not  only  at  NASA  but  across  the  entire  country,
and this fact has been decried from many quarters. The NRC report, ‘‘Rising Above
the  Gathering  Storm,’’  makes  this  case  most  emphatically.  Other  technical  indus-
tries  have  been  able  to  compensate  somewhat  by  tapping  the  pool  of  highly-trained
immigrants and foreign students, and they often outsource work abroad. But space-
craft are ITAR sensitive items, so this pool is not available to NASA or to its outside
space-enterprise partners, even to universities, because of the constraints of the law.
All  the  space  programs  at  NASA,  DOE,  NOAA,  and  the  DOD  feel  this  shortage
acutely.  And  the  situation  will  probably  just  get  worse  unless  something  is  done.
NASA  commissioned  the  NRC  to  study  how  the  workforce  necessary  to  carry  out
the Vision for Space Exploration can be maintained given the impending retirement
of  much  technical  talent.  The  report,  released  earlier  this  week,  cites  the  need  for
more highly skilled program and project managers and systems engineers who have
acquired  substantial  experience  in  space  systems  development,  and  identifies  lim-
ited  opportunities  for  junior  specialists  to  obtain  hands-on  space  project  experience
as  one  of  the  impediments  to  NASA’s  ability  to  execute  the  Vision.  The  report  rec-
ommends  that  NASA  place  a  high  priority  on  recruiting,  training  and  retaining
skilled  program  and  project  managers  and  systems  engineers,  and  that  it  provide
hands-on  training  and  development  opportunities  for  younger  and  junior  personnel
(Building  a  Better  NASA  Workforce:  Meeting  the  Workforce  Needs  for  the  National
Vision for Space Exploration, p. 7).

It  is  clear  that  there  is  a  shortage  of  engineers  and  scientists  who  have  actually
built space hardware, and know how that hardware can be integrated and function
within  larger,  more  complex  systems.  NASA  science  programs  are  a  critical  source
of  this  needed  native  talent,  whether  they  remain  in  NASA  science  programs  or
move  out  into  the  larger  industrial  base.  Education  at  its  very  best  is  a  process  of
discovery  and  of  trial-and-error:  the  efficacy  of  learning-by-doing  has  been  proven
over many years.

NASA needs to maintain its investment in space science programs that allow uni-
versities  to  attract  and  engage  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  in  all  aspects
of  mission  development  and  deployment—from  proof  of  concept  studies,  to  proposal
submittal,  to  prototype  development,  to  launch,  data  analysis,  and  publication.
Whether  these  programs  have  short  or  long  time  horizons,  there  are  ways  to  allow
the  next  generation  of  space  scientists  to  participate  in  all  aspects  of  an  exciting
NASA mission.
4. What  would  be  the  top  three  investments  that  could  be  made  to  benefit  the

Heliophysics program over the long-term?
The  Heliophysics  Division  would  benefit  substantially  in  the  long-term  from  sev-
eral  immediate  investments.  These  include  not  only  dollars,  but  ‘‘intellectual  cap-
ital’’  and  renewed  commitments  to  a  properly  balanced  experimental,  theoretical,
and modeling program.
• Lower cost and frequent access to space. In my view, the single greatest im-
pediment  to  a  healthy  and  vigorous  Heliophysics  program  is  the  uncertainty  and
cost  of  getting  spacecraft  and  sub-orbital  missions  launched.  Obviously,  the
Heliophysics  Division  cannot,  and  should  not,  pay  for  developing  new  launch  vehi-
cles. But HPD, NASA in general, the Congress, and other stakeholders should work
together  to  make  sure  that  every  avenue  for  launching  space  hardware  is  made
readily  available  to  research  teams.  This  should  include  less  expensive  domestic
launch  vehicles,  ‘‘military’’  launchers  (such  as  the  Minotaur  rocket),  secondary
launch capabilities on commercial and U.S. military vehicles, and unfettered access

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

to  non-U.S.  launch  vehicles.  In  the  latter  category  are  launches  on  European,  In-
dian,  Japanese,  and  other  launch  systems  that  can  offer  very  attractive  prices  for
access  to  space.  A  secondary  launch  on  an  Ariane  5  vehicle,  for  example,  could  be
obtained for as little as $1 million or so.

In  this  category  of  access  to  space,  I  would  also  place  Missions  of  Opportunity
(MoOs).  Launching  NASA  instruments  or  payload  suites  on  commercial  or  military
vehicles, or on-board foreign spacecraft, can provide tremendous ‘‘bang for the buck.’’
I know from public statements by Dr. Stern that he recognizes the power and bene-
fits of MoOs and I hope this avenue to space can be pursued aggressively. The MoO
component should certainly be restored explicitly to the Radiation Belt Storm Probe
program.
• Regular  cadence  and  more  frequent  small-end  missions.  As  pointed  out
above, the key to a healthy, robust Heliophysics program is to have more and better
opportunities  for  Small  Explorer  (SMEX),  University-Class  Explorer  (UNEX),  and
sub-orbital  missions.  This  emphasis  is  wholly  consistent  with  the  Decadal  Survey
recommendations  and  it  fulfills  a  wide  variety  of  programmatic,  educational,  and
workforce  training  goals  that  I  have  alluded  to  above.  The  investment  necessary  to
achieve  the  desired  outcome  in  this  arena  could  be  readily  accomplished  (I  believe)
by restoring the Explorer mission line to the budgetary level that existed in the FY
2004  budget  plan  (?$350  million  per  year).  The  combination  of  sound  management
approaches,  reasonable  launch  costs,  sensible  numbers  of  reviews,  and  appropriate
levels of risk tolerance would, I maintain, allow a very vigorous small-mission capa-
bility within Heliophysics for a very modest amount of new budgetary authority.
• Improve  management  of  mission  costs.  As  has  been  alluded  to  above,  the
Heliophysics  missions—as  with  most  of  NASA  programs—have  increased  in  cost  to
well  above  the  levels  planned  in  the  2003  Decadal  Survey.  Much  of  this  has  been
due to factors touched on earlier: access to space has become prohibitively expensive
and  ‘‘risk  aversion’’  has  increased  mission  development  costs  to  extraordinary
heights.  I  believe  that  Heliophysics  should  invest  time  and  money  now  into  devel-
oping  an  approach  to  mission  management  that  uses  prudent  levels  of  reviews  and
much  wiser  risk  mitigation  strategies.  Some  years  ago—perhaps  a  decade  or  so—
‘‘best  practices’’  were  developed  for  PI-led  missions  and  I  firmly  believe  those  prac-
tices  could  and  should  still  serve  as  the  basis  for  managing  essentially  all
Heliophysics  instrument  and  spacecraft  programs.  A  small  investment  now  in  im-
proved  management  approaches  both  at  NASA  Headquarters  and  NASA  Centers
would pay tremendous future dividends.
Summary

Fortunately,  smaller-end  programs  such  as  R&A,  sounding  rockets,  and  the  Ex-
plorer mission line could be restored to the levels anticipated in the FY 2004 budget
by infusions of modest amounts of budget authority. For the larger Heliophysics pro-
grams (Solar-Terrestrial Probes and Flagship missions), comparatively higher levels
of  resources  are  required.  Better  management  of  programs  and  containment  of  cost
growth  is  clearly  necessary  to  stretch  available  dollars.  However,  absent  a  restora-
tion  of  more  balanced  budgets  to  levels  planned  as  recently  as  FY  2004,  it  will  not
be  possible  to  have  a  robust  program  that  is  capable  of  meeting  high  priority  na-
tional needs.

Thank you very much for your attention.

Dr. BURNS. That works much better. Let me try that again.
Chairman  Udall,  Ranking  Member  Calvert,  and  Representative
Johnson,  I  sincerely  appreciate  this  opportunity  to  testify  to  you
today.

Since Sputnik’s launch 50 years ago this October, all Earth’s peo-
ples  have  been  privileged  to  participate  as  our  planetary  environs
have  been  explored,  discovered,  and  understood,  to  invoke  NASA’s
mantra.

This  continues  today.  We  have  two  twin  Mars  rovers  that  are—
carried  back  the  story  that  there—Mars  was  once  wet.  We  have  a
remarkable  spacecraft  in  orbit  around  Saturn,  the  Cassini  space-
craft.  We  also  have  Alan’s  New  Horizons.  It  has  just  slipped  past
Jupiter a few months back.

So  this  is  a—America’s  planetary  exploration  program  today  is
indeed  doing  extremely  well,  but  its  future  is  quite  uncertain.  I
submit that an appropriate analogy might be that today’s planetary
program  is  a  powerful  ship  that  appears  to  be  staunchly  cruising
along,  but  our  vessel  is  sailing  so  smoothly  nowadays  principally
because  of  yesterday’s  investments.  Without  continued  investment
and attention, the ship’s momentum will inexorably drain away.

Today’s craft is running low on fuel. Some of its machines are not
being  properly  maintained.  Upgraded,  improved  replacement  in-
struments  are  unavailable,  and  sadly,  to  me,  the  boat’s  crew  is
aging.

Fortunately, to deal with these treacherous times, we have a new
Admiral,  Alan,  and  a  new  Captain  to  our  ship,  Jim  Green.  These
are  excellent  choices,  and  we  are  very  pleased  to  be  able  to  work
with them.

I  would  like  to  move  to  your  question—the  questions  that  you
asked  me.  The  first  concern,  mission  mix.  Missions  are,  of  course,
the  engineering  marvels  that  provide  us  the  capability  to  explore,
as NASA’s slogan states. So how do the various missions and their
mix fare in the fiscal year 2008 budget and beyond?

The  pace  of  the  future  Discovery  missions  seem  about  on  track
right now, after several years of delayed selections. The New Fron-
tiers line, the middle line, seems also on track, roughly. I am sorry,
has  fallen  to  half  of  the  plan  grade.  The  next  selection  should  be
made in the next year to get this program back on track.

Once  again,  there  are  no  new  flagship  missions  in  the  planetary
area,  and  the  fact  no  funds  are  available  in  the  foreseeable  future
to  actually  build  and  fly  any  flagship,  if  one  were  to  be  selected.
Mars  flight  missions  have  been  reduced  from  a  nominal  two
launches per opportunity to just one every two years.

So the reigning in of the aspirations of the planetary program is
a  direct  consequence  of  fewer  dollars  being  available.  The  Agency
budget  has  not  grown  to  accommodate  the  President’s  exploration
vision, and NASA has covered its shortfall by draining three or $4
billion  from  the  science  program,  much  of  that  coming  from  solar
system exploration, especially the Mars program.

I  am  especially  perplexed  that  NASA  should—would  choose  to
lessen  robotic  solar  system  studies,  especially  investigations  of
Mars, given the ultimate destination for the President’s vision.

Much  of  the  slowdown  in  America’s  exploration  of  the  solar  sys-
tem  is  not  presently  apparent,  because  most  of  the  pain  has  been
deferred to past 2010. Planetary missions require technological de-
velopment, an educated work force, an excited work force, advanced
planning, especially if we are to collaborate with international part-
ners.

What  about  research  and  analysis  funds?  Research  and  analysis
funds  have  dropped  by  one-quarter  since  fiscal  year  2005.  The
budget  that  you  are  considering  today  recommends  that  this  line
continue to slip further behind the inflation rate, in clear contradic-
tion to the decadal report.

Yet,  it  is  only  through  these  studies  that  the  American  popu-
lation will understand the data that is being Mars, Saturn and our
other  outposts.  We  can  only  plan  for  the  future  wisely  if  we  have
sufficient R&A funds.

Similarly,  if  we  are  to  discover  things,  that  whole  process  be-
comes  problematic  if  there  are  only  limited  opportunities  exist  to
analyze  the  mission  results.  Funding  for  data  analysis  should  in-
crease  in  proportion  to  the  growing  data  volume  and  the  diversity
of targets that we are visiting.

What  are  the  top  risks  for  the  next  five  years?  The  future  U.S.
space enterprise is jeopardized by the loss of its core competencies,
both  in  technology  development  and  personnel,  and  this  is  a  con-
sequence  of  inadequate  base  program  resources.  Furthermore,  the
rapid  growth  in  mission  costs  limits  the  nature  and  number  of
flights  that  we  can  fly.  And  finally,  the  lack  of  a  long  lived  power
sources will prevent any missions to the outer solar system.

What are especially beneficial strategic investments? I believe in-
vestments in core technologies, science instruments and infrastruc-

tures, such as the Deep Space Network, will be most fruitful for the
long-term health of the planetary exploration program.

The  overall  budget  for  solar  system  exploration  should  be  rein-
stated so as to allow a continuing reasonable rate of Discovery and
New  Frontier  flights,  but  also  a  new  flagship  mission,  since  all
classes  of  mission  size  play  important  roles  in  any  balanced  plan.
A sharp increase in R&A funds are essential to a healthy program.
In conclusion, these are exciting times for the planetary program.
Unfortunately, budgetary constraints are jeopardizing the future of
this  program.  If  the  United  States  is  to  explore,  discover  and  un-
derstand  Earth’s  surroundings,  as  NASA  claims  it  wishes  to  do,
more  attention  and  additional  fundings  are—funding  are  required.
Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  thank  you  for
your  attention  today,  but  most  of  all  for  your  continuing  support
of the planetary exploration program.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Burns follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOSEPH A. BURNS

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

I  appreciate  having  this  opportunity  to  testify  before  you  today.  For  most  of  my
professional life, I have been an active planetary scientist and an unabashed enthu-
siast  for  space  exploration.  I  chaired  the  1994  National  Research  Council  (NRC)
strategy  for  solar  system  exploration,  and  more  recently  I  was  a  member  of  the
NRC’s  2003  decadal  panel  on  planetary  sciences.  I  also  served  as  a  panel  member
on the NRC’s 2001 decadal report for astronomy and astrophysics.

We  meet  at  a  time  when,  once  again,  NASA’s  planetary  missions  are  returning
truly  remarkable  results.  For  the  last  three  years,  the  twin  Mars  Rovers  have
marched systematically across Mars’s arid surface, poking their instruments into as-
sorted  rocks.  These  measurements  and  observations  by  several  superb  orbiting
spacecraft have revolutionized our perception of the Red Planet, revealing it to have
previously  been  episodically  much  wetter  and  perhaps  even  hospitable  to  life.
Cassini,  the  most  recent  planetary  flagship  mission,  is  orbiting  Saturn,  where  its
broad  instrument  suite  has  been  surveying  this  ringed  beauty  for  nearly  three
years,  finding  that  a  disparate  pair  of  Saturnian  satellites—Titan  and  Enceladus—
are  potentially  habitable  islands  in  this  frigid  world.  Stardust’s  capsule  has  re-
turned samples of comet Wild-2’s dust back to Earth and this material has testified
about  the  turbulent  nature  of  the  gas/dust  cloud  that  gave  birth  to  our  local  plan-
etary  system.  New  Horizons  peeked  at  Jupiter  as  it  streaked  past  on  its  voyage  to
Pluto.  And  just  last  week,  a  Swiss  team  spied  the  229th  extra-solar  planet,  and  a
most  special  one:  the  first  known  so  far,  but  for  Earth,  to  reside  in  its  star’s  habit-
able  zone,  where  water—life’s  requisite  ingredient—remains  fluid.  The  early  21st
century  is  truly  a  time  of  extraordinary  discovery  in  planetary  and  other  space
sciences.  The  continuing  generous  and  unwavering  support  of  Congress  and  the
American people has made these accomplishments possible.

Starting  with  Sputnik’s  launch  fifty  years  ago  this  October,  all  Earth’s  peoples—
including  you  and  I—have  been  privileged  to  participate  as  our  planetary  environs
have  been  ‘‘explored,  discovered  and  understood’’,  to  invoke  NASA’s  mantra.  Sci-
entists  believe  that  this  exploration  program  addresses  profound  questions  about
our  origins  and  that  it  provides  unique  insights  into  how  our  Earth  functions  as  a
planet. At the same time the public finds this investigation of Earth’s surroundings
to  be  inspiring  and  meaningful.  January’s  issue  of  the  popular  magazine  Discover
listed  its  top-ranked  one  hundred  findings  across  all  scientific  disciplines  during
2006.  Of  these,  fully  one-seventh  came  from  astronomy,  with  half  concerning  solar
system  objects  or  extra-solar  planets.  So  what  could  be  better?  The  reason  why  we
aren’t  all  celebrating  is,  because,  while  America’s  planetary  exploration  program  is
indeed doing well currently, its future is quite uncertain.

I submit to you that an appropriate analogy might be that today’s planetary pro-
gram  is  like  a  powerful  ship  that  appears  to  be  staunchly  cruising  along,  making
good progress as its crew explores and probes a rich, ever-surprising shoreline. But
our vessel is sailing so smoothly nowadays principally because of yesterday’s invest-
ments.  Without  continued  attention,  the  ship’s  momentum  will  inexorably  be
drained away. In fact, today’s craft is running low on fuel, some of its machines are
not  being  properly  maintained  and  upgraded,  improved  replacement  instruments

are  unavailable,  and  sadly  the  boat’s  crew  is  aging.  Surprisingly,  this  ship  is  from
the  Nation  that  has  always  led  in  exploration  of  the  cosmos.  Maybe  other  nations
instead  will  guide  humankind’s  search  of  the  next  shoreline,  just  as  four  centuries
ago  England  replaced  the  Portuguese  and  the  Spanish,  partway  through  the  explo-
ration and subsequent development of the New World. Only if we are vigilant today
will our ship’s journey be secure, with it re-supplied, its instruments revitalized and
its crew replaced.

To  carry  our  nautical  analogy  one  step  further,  fortunately  during  these  treach-
erous  times  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  has  a  new  admiral—Alan  Stern—
and the Planetary Science Division has a new captain—Jim Green. These are excel-
lent  choices—enthusiastic,  knowledgeable  and  creative  scientists  who  happily  are
also experienced and successful managers. They will be energetic advocates for—and
tireless workers toward—a productive, healthy and effective planetary program.

I  now  respond  to  the  topics  that  you  have  asked  me  to  address.  Please  note  that
my ordering is a little different than yours and that many of these items are linked
so that my answers to one may overlap with another topic.
Mission mix

Here I will restrict my comments to a consideration of missions; these engineering
marvels  provide  us  the  capability  to  ‘‘explore’’  as  NASA’s  slogan  states.  Technology
development and research funding will be discussed in later sections.

Planetary  science’s  2003  decadal  survey  recommends  a  finely  tuned  mix  of  mis-
sion  sizes,  each  with  its  own  programmatic  purpose,  cost  cap  and  launch  rate.  Dis-
covery  missions  (e.g.,  Deep  Impact  that  slammed  into  comet  Tempel-1  on  July  4,
2005)  permit  rapid  response  to  discoveries  across  a  range  of  topics;  such  missions
should launch every eighteen months or so. New Frontiers spacecraft (e.g., the New
Horizons  mission  en  route  to  Pluto  and  beyond)  allow  thorough  study  of  pressing
scientific  questions,  with  a  selection  every  two  or  three  years.  Flagship  missions
(e.g., the Cassini spacecraft presently observing the Saturn system)—comprehensive
investigations of extraordinary high-priority targets—should be flown at the rate of
about  one  per  decade.  The  separate  Mars  program  has  a  comparable  breakdown  of
mission classes into large, medium and small (Mars Scout) categories.

How do the various missions and their mix fare in the FY08 budget and beyond?
The  pace  of  future  Discovery  missions  seems  about  on  track,  after  several  years  of
delayed  selections.  The  New  Frontiers  line  has  fallen  to  half  the  planned  rate;  the
next  selection  should  be  made  in  the  next  year  to  get  this  program  back  on  track.
Once again, no new Flagships have been started. The Europa Geophysical Orbiter
has  been  indefinitely  deferred;  it  was  THE  Flagship  mission  recommended  for  this
decade  by  the  decadal  study.  In  fact,  at  present,  no  planetary  flagship  mission  is
in  development,  an  unprecedented  situation  that  has  not  happened  since  the  start
of  the  American  planetary  program.  Hence,  in  view  of  the  necessary  preparations
and  required  budget,  no  major  mission  will  be  launched  until  2017,  and  even  that
schedule  will  require  a  significant  augmentation  to  the  budget.  I  am  somewhat  en-
couraged that NASA has recently initiated $1M studies of four potential very capa-
ble missions to satellites of Jupiter and Saturn; three of these spacecraft would rec-
onnoiter  their  targets  for  their  suitability  to  sustain  life.  Nonetheless  it  should  be
recognized  that  no  funds  are  available  in  the  foreseeable  future  to  actually  build
and fly any Flagship, if one were to be selected.

Mars  flight  missions  have  been  reduced  from  a  nominal  two  launches  per  oppor-
tunity to just one every two years. To accommodate this change, the number of me-
dium-class  missions  to  the  Red  Planet  is  lowered,  and  two  Mars  Scouts  are  elimi-
nated. In terms of Flagships, during the FY 2006 budget-rebalancing exercise, Mars
Sample Return, a crucial mission to understand the Martian mineralogy and to de-
velop  a  Martian  chronology,  was  delayed  from  ‘‘early  in  the  next  decade’’  until  at
least ∼2024.

The reining-in of the aspirations of the planetary program is a direct consequence
of  fewer  dollars  being  available.  The  agency  budget  has  not  grown  to  accommodate
the President’s exploration vision, and so NASA has covered its shortfall by draining
$3  B  from  the  science  program,  97  percent  of  that  coming  from  solar  system  explo-
ration,  especially  Mars.  Thus  the  planetary  program  has  become  a  source  of  funds
to  support  other  demands  for  NASA’s  needs.  I  am  puzzled  that  NASA  would  chose
to  lessen  robotic  solar  system  studies,  especially  investigations  of  Mars,  given  the
ultimate destination for the President’s vision. The NRC’s Space Studies Board has
been  steady  in  its  belief  that  robotic  exploration  and  human  exploration  are  com-
plementary ventures to understand and exploit Earth’s neighbors.

At  the  time  when  the  American  solar  system  exploration  program  is  slowing
down, our international partners (and competitors) are expanding theirs. The Euro-
pean  Space  Agency  has  very  capable  spacecraft  orbiting  each  of  Earth’s  planetary

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

68

neighbors, as well as another well-instrumented craft on its way to land on a comet.
And  soon  yet  more  European  spacecraft  will  be  exploring  the  Moon,  where  it  will
join scientific missions from Japan, China and India. Now, when other nations have
improved  capabilities,  we  should  be  pursuing  increased  interactions  with  them.
However,  ITAR  regulations  hamper  international  cooperation  on  existing  and
planned space missions.

Much  of  the  slowdown  in  America’s  exploration  of  the  solar  system  is  not  pres-
ently  apparent  because  most  of  pain  has  been  deferred  to  beyond  2011. . .to  the
next  administration.  But  planetary  missions  require  extended  advanced  planning,
especially  if  we  are  to  collaborate  with  international  partners.  For  example,  the
Cassini-Huygens  mission  to  Saturn,  on  which  I  am  a  member,  started  planning  in
the  early  1980’s,  selection  of  payload  instruments  and  team  members  took  place  in
1990,  launch  in  1997,  arrival  in  2004.  Scientific  results  were  not  returned  until
more than twenty years after the mission was initially devised.

The reduced run-out budget for the planetary division, coupled with growth in the
cost to mount each of these mission classes, means that the planetary survey’s plan
is  not  attainable.  New  flight  projects,  especially  for  outer  planet  (see  below)  and
Mars  exploration,  will  not  be  started.  The  reduction  in  missions  can  be  painlessly
accommodated  in  the  short  term  because  the  affected  missions  occur  beyond  2011.
However, if the workforce drifts away to other areas and if technology development
lags,  the  loss  to  the  U.S.  planetary  program  will  become  increasingly  irreversible.
Analysts suggest that a minimum of at least $200 M more annually would be need-
ed  in  the  PSD  budget  in  order  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  strategic  plans  of  the
decadal survey.
Research and analysis funds

Now  I  will  address  the  support  for  research  and  analysis  (R&A)  and  technology
development. The 2003 planetary survey recommended ‘‘an increase over the decade
in  the  funding  for  fundamental  research  and  analysis  programs  at  a  rate  above  in-
flation. . .[till  it  reaches]  closer  to  25  percent  of  the  overall  flight-mission  budget.’’
Instead  R&A  funding  has  fallen  one-quarter  from  its  FY05  level.  The  budget  that
you are considering today recommends that this budget line continue to slip further
behind  the  inflation  rate,  in  clear  contradiction  to  the  decadal  report.  Yet  it  is  only
through these studies that the American populace ‘‘understands’’ the data being re-
turned from Mars, Saturn and other scientific stations.

This continuing decline in R&A funding is troubling for several reasons. Improved
understanding  and  answers  motivate  our  visits  to  other  solar  system  bodies;  to  ac-
complish these goals requires follow-up studies. When funds for supporting research
are tight, scientists who are early in their careers are most affected. I know several
young scientists who are contemplating career changes because they perceive bleak
prospects  with  space  missions.  Moreover,  any  shortfall  in  the  science  and  engineer-
ing  workforce  will  damage  the  long-term  technical  and  scientific  capabilities  that
underpin the solar system exploration program. Finally, with few academic posts as
yet  in  this  emerging  discipline  and  with  limited  interest  to  date  from  the  defense/
commercial  sectors,  a  higher  fraction  of  the  planetary  community  is  supported  by
soft  money  than  in  other  astronomical  disciplines.  Taking  a  bigger  view,  I  am  sur-
prised  that  NASA’s  science  program  has  not  been  considered  part  of  the  America’s
Competitive Initiative, for this program has drawn many to engineering and science
as careers.

NASA’s  goal  to  ‘‘discover’’  becomes  somewhat  problematic  if  only  limited  opportu-
nities exist to analyze mission results. Funding for data analysis should increase in
proportion  to  the  growing  data  volume  and  the  diversity  of  targets,  now  including
solar wind samples, comet dust, remote-sensing data obtained by dedicated missions
at  terrestrial  and  giant  planets  and  measurements  taken  at  academic  laboratories.
Top risks for next five years

The  future  U.S.  space  enterprise  is  jeopardized  by  the  loss  of  core  competencies
(both  technology  development  and  personnel)  as  a  consequence  of  inadequate  base-
program resources. Furthermore, the rapid growth in mission costs limits the nature
and number of flights that can be flown. Finally the lack of long-lived power sources
will prevent missions to the outer solar system.

Monies  for  technology  development  are  limited.  Nonetheless  the  American  plan-
etary program needs more capable instruments to perform more effectively in more
difficult environs. For example, dollars could be saved and mission opportunities ex-
panded  if  in-space  advanced  propulsion  and  more  efficient  radioisotope  power  sys-
tems were available. Future missions will require that samples be returned from in-
hospitable places and/or that on-site analytical tools be accessible. A healthy funding
level would support new instrument development through space flight qualification.

69

A  limited  budget  causes  a  chicken-and-egg  problem:  present-day  funds  cannot  sup-
port both capable missions and the technology that makes those missions as worth-
while as they might be.

Mission  costs  are  rising  quickly  for  several  reasons.  For  some  years  NASA  has
been  risk-averse  and,  in  today’s  litigious  society,  this  tendency  has  only  increased.
This  leads  to  unnecessary  oversight  and  documentation,  with  attendant  costs,  both
financial  and  programmatic.  The  absence  of  an  adequate  technology  development
program requires either the costly ab initio development of new instruments or fly-
ing  last  year’s  technology.  ITAR,  which  considers  satellite  technology  to  automati-
cally be munitions under State Department rules, hamstrings spacecraft operations
and  complicates  international  space  programs.  Expendable  launch  vehicle  costs  are
growing  faster  than  inflation,  because  of  the  limited  market.  Discovery  has  a  sepa-
rate  problem:  the  imminent  phase-out  of  the  Delta-II  expendable  launch  vehicle,
which  will  require  future  flights  to  be  flown  aboard  the  more-expensive  and  too-ca-
pable EELV (evolved extended launch vehicle) fleet, namely Delta-IVs and Atlas-Vs.
Given  Discovery’s  fixed  cost  cap,  substantial  increases  in  launch-vehicle  costs  erode
the science that these missions can achieve.

The  usual  power  supply  for  missions  beyond  Jupiter—RTGs  containing  pluto-
nium–238—is increasingly scarce, meaning that new starts to outer solar system are
no  longer  feasible.  Unless  this  issue  can  be  resolved  to  provide  power  on  distant
flights, the solar system no longer extends to comet belt, but rather it stops at Jupi-
ter,  something  similar  to  halting  Henry  Hudson  at  the  Azores.  This  is  especially
troubling as many of the discipline’s highest priority targets—Jovian and Saturnian
satellites  plus  Neptune/Triton—are  very  distant.  These  power  generators  are  also
preferred for energy-intensive explorations of Mars.
Especially beneficial strategic investments

Investments  in  core  technologies,  science  instruments  and  infrastructure  will  be
most  fruitful  for  the  long-term  health  of  the  planetary  exploration  program.  Such
investments are likely to also benefit other parts of NASA, additional federal agen-
cies that have space platforms and the commercial sector.

The overall budget for solar system exploration should be reinstated so as to allow
a  continuing  reasonable  rate  of  Discovery  and  New  Frontier  flights,  but  also  a  new
Flagship  mission,  since  all  classes  play  important  roles  in  any  balanced  plan.  A
sharp increase in R&A funds is essential to a healthy program.

The  Human  Exploration  program  needs  to  be  stabilized  in  order  to  minimize  its
potentially  adverse  impact  on  science  programs.  The  Shuttle  should  be  retired  by
2011 to obviate serious concerns about its safety. Moreover, the operational costs of
the Shuttle are eating NASA’s lunch (and dinner!).
Place of NASA’s proposed lunar science initiative

In  spite  of  the  current  drought  in  new  mission  starts,  humankind’s  exploration
of the Moon is reasonably robust, thanks in part to significant international involve-
ment.  At  the  Moon,  or  soon  to  be  launched,  are  six  lunar  missions:  four  from  other
nations  (Europe,  China,  Japan  and  India)  as  well  as  a  U.S.  Lunar  Reconnaissance
Orbiter  and  a  U.S.  Lunar  Crater  Observation  and  Sensing  Satellite.  With  this  ex-
pansion  of  information  about  the  Moon,  it  may  be  time  to  reassess  the  adequacy  of
the  current  lunar  research  budget  line  to  benefit  fully  from  the  returned  results
about the surface and interior of Earth’s natural satellite.

In  addition  to  these  more  focused  missions,  one  of  the  decadal  study’s  rec-
ommended  New  Frontiers  was  to  return  samples  from  a  deep  lunar  crater,  partly
to learn what the lunar interior can tell about the Moon’s origin, but also to develop
technology  that  may  be  deployed  at  Mars  and  Venus  as  well  as  on  comet  nuclei.
This  mission  has  not  yet  been  selected,  but  it  undoubtedly  will  be  a  candidate  in
the  next  round.  In  the  more  distant  future,  we  have  the  prospect  of  human  explo-
ration of the Moon beginning as early as 2020. All told, these programs form a sus-
tainable initiative of lunar science exploration.
Concluding Remarks

These are exciting times for the planetary program. Unfortunately budgetary con-
straints  are  jeopardizing  the  future  of  this  program.  If  the  United  States  is  to  ‘‘ex-
plore,  discover,  understand’’  Earth’s  surroundings,  as  NASA  claims  it  wishes  to  do,
more  attention  and  additional  funding  seem  to  be  required.  The  planetary  science
community believes that, with Congressional support, and new very capable leaders
at  the  helm  of  our  ship  of  discovery,  our  nation’s  exploration  of  the  solar  system
will continue to make great progress in understanding our neighboring worlds.

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  I  thank  you  for  your  attention
today,  but  most  of  all  for  your  continuing  support  to  NASA’s  planetary  exploration
program.

Outline of Joseph A. Burns’s remarks to the U.S. House Science Committee

5/2/07

The  U.S.  planetary  program  is  producing  extraordinary  scientific  results  across
the solar system as a result of long-term support from Congress. However, the pro-
posed FY08 budget i) is insufficient to allow the mix and pace of flight missions that
was  recommended  by  the  2003  planetary  decadal  survey;  ii)  should  be  augmented
to  support  more  data  analysis;  and  iii)  falls  far  short  of  the  funds  that  would  ade-
quately  strengthen  the  necessary  associated  Research  and  Analysis.  The  top  risks
faced  by  NASA’s  Planetary  Science  Division  are  inadequate  funding  of  technology
development,  lessened  availability  of  suitable  flight  and  power  systems,  rising  mis-
sion  costs  and  the  dwindling  supply  of  plutonium  to  allow  missions  to  the  outer
solar  system.  Additional  strategic  investments  in  infrastructure,  core  technologies
and  scientific  personnel  would  prove  especially  valuable  for  the  long-term  vitality
of the U.S. solar system exploration program. The lunar exploration program is rea-
sonably  sound,  principally  because  of  international  missions.  Without  augmented
funding,  it  is  questionable  whether  NASA  will  be  able  to  fulfill  its  stated  goal  of
‘‘explore, discover, understand.’’

BIOGRAPHY FOR JOSEPH A. BURNS

Joseph  A.  Burns  is  the  Vice  Provost  for  Physical  Sciences  and  Engineering,  the
Irving  Porter  Church  Professor  of  Engineering  and  Professor  of  Astronomy  at  Cor-
nell  University.  Joe  received  a  B.S.  from  Webb  Institute  of  Naval  Architecture  in
1962;  Cornell  awarded  his  Ph.D.  in  space  mechanics  in  1966.  In  addition  to  his  ac-
tivities  in  Ithaca,  Burns  has  held  year-long  appointments  at  two  NASA  facilities
(Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  and  Ames  Research  Center),  at  UC–Berkeley  and  at
the University of Arizona. Burns has also spent extended leaves in Moscow, Prague,
and  Paris.  He  is  a  member  of  the  imaging  teams  for  the  Cassini  (Saturn)  and  Ro-
setta (European comet) missions, and was an associate of the Galileo imaging team.
Burns has written more than two hundred papers—both original research and ex-
tensive review articles—in the refereed literature. His current research concerns the
orbital  and  rotational  evolution  of  solar  system  bodies,  especially  planetary  rings
and  the  small  bodies  of  the  solar  system  (dust,  satellites,  comets  and  asteroids).
Using  ground-based  telescopes  and  spacecraft,  his  students  and  he  have  discovered
dozens of irregular satellites and several planetary rings.

Burns  edited  Icarus,  the  principal  journal  of  planetary  science,  between  1979–
1997. He edited two books, Planetary Satellites (1977) and Satellites (1986). He cur-
rently  sits  on  the  editorial  boards  of  Science,  Icarus  and  Celestial  Mechanics  &  Dy-
namical  Astronomy.  Joe  has  served  on  many  NASA  scientific  advisory  groups  and
two  terms  on  the  Space  Studies  Board  of  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC),
chairing  its  Committee  on  Planetary  and  Lunar  Exploration;  the  latter  wrote  the
NRC’s  first  planetary  exploration  strategy  in  1994.  He  also  sat  on  the  executive
committee  for  the  2003  planetary  decadal  report  and  was  a  panel  member  for  the
astronomy  community’s  2001  decadal  strategy.  He  has  been  Vice  President  of  the
American  Astronomical  Society;  earlier  he  led  its  Divisions  for  Planetary  Science
(DPS)  and  on  Dynamical  Astronomy  (DDA).  He  chairs  the  International  Astronom-
ical Union’s Commission on celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy. Burns is
a  fellow  of  the  American  Geophysical  Union  and  of  the  AAAS,  a  member  of  the
International Academy of Astronautics, and a foreign member of the Russian Acad-
emy  of  Sciences.  He  has  received  the  DPS’s  Masursky  Prize,  the  USSR’s  Schmidt
medal and several NASA awards for research achievements.

Funding.  Professor  Burns’s  current  personal  research  support  comes  solely  from
NASA.  He  has  held  a  Planetary  Geology  and  Geophysics  grant  for  theoretical  and
dynamical  modeling  for  many  years.  He  is  funded  as  an  imaging  team  member  of
the  Cassini  mission  at  Saturn  by  the  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory.  These  grants  pay
for two post-doctoral associates and a graduate student, and part of Burns’s summer
salary.  His  work  as  an  imaging  team  member  on  the  European  Rosetta  comet  mis-
sion is unfunded. Burns has previously received grants from the NY Council on the
Arts,  NATO,  the  National  Research  Council’  Soviet  Exchange  Program  and  the
NSF. As Vice Provost for Physical Sciences and Engineering, Burns is Cornell’s cog-
nizant  administrator  over  about  a  dozen  interdisciplinary  research  centers,  most  of
whose primary grants are from the NSF.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Dr.  Burns.  I  want  to  thank  the
panel in general. We will move now to the period where we will ask
a series of questions. I think we are going to at least have a couple
of  rounds,  and  perhaps  a  third  round,  depending  on  what  is  hap-
pening  on  the  Floor.  And  Dr.  Stern,  I  am  going  to  start  with  the
rest  of  the  panel,  but  I  want  you  to  know  that  we  will  come  back
to you. And since we have the panel here, I would like to ask each
of the witnesses, you heard Dr. Stern testify about his vision prior-
ities.  I  would  like  ask  each  of  you  what,  in  your  opinion,  is  the
most  important  issue  that  Dr.  Stern  needs  to  address  as  head  of
the—Science Mission Director.

I  should  say  I  am  yielding  myself  the  five  minutes  here,  and  we
will move to Mr. Calvert. So we will start with Dr. Fisk and move
across.

MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR SMD

Dr.  FISK.  First  of  all,  let  me  state  that  I  have  great  faith  that
Alan’s going to make really good decisions, and the reason is, I be-
lieve  he  understands  from  his  experience,  having  been  a  working
P.I.  and  having  been  from  the  community,  understands  the  issues
that we are facing in the community.

In  very  simple  terms,  the  issue  is—and  the  one  we  have  flagged
throughout this—these statements, in fact, is the balance what we
are doing at the moment and what we—and how to protect the fu-
ture  of  this  program.  And  the  future  of  the  program  is  in  people,
the future of the program is in new technologies. The future of the
program is in new missions, and we have to create the right invest-
ments  in  that  future  in  this  current  budget  in  order  to  make  sure
that  the  space  program  goes  on  and  is  productive  for  the  decades
to come.

We  are  not  ending  this  adventure.  This  adventure  is  only  begin-
ning, and the question is, how do we make sure that we are doing
today protects, enhances and makes possible that future?

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Illingworth.
Dr. ILLINGWORTH. Yes, thank you.
I think all of us who have been involved in space missions recog-
nize  that  there  are  very  long  lead  times,  often  decades  or  more.  I
actually  was  involved  in  one  of  the  first  meetings  that  was  orga-
nized  for  JWST  in  1988.  It  would  be  25  years  before  we  launched
that program, and this is not uncommon.

And  so,  a  lack  of  funding  profile  in  the  future,  unfortunately,
eats the seed corn for the future as well. That if we are at the posi-
tion where we are not building a strong people base, a strong tech-
nological  base,  we  are  placing  our  future  program  at  risk  in  ways
that are not immediately obvious.

Fortunately,  I  think  Alan  and  his  group,  because  of  his  recogni-
tion of this, having been a working P.I., is strongly concerned about
this,  and  the  statements  that  he  has  made  over  the  last  month,
and  moves  that  he  has  done  in  bringing  in  new  people,  I  think
have been very good. But it will be a challenge, because it also re-
quires  resources  to  do  this.  So  it  is  recognition  one,  and  then  re-
sources two. Thank you.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Baker.
Dr.  BAKER.  I  believe  that  the  amount  of  money  that  is  available
for  science  in  NASA,  $5.4  billion  or  so,  is  a  tremendous  amount  of
money, and can be used more effectively than it is being used.

I  believe  that  number—the  steps  that  Alan  has  outlined  in  his
testimony  and  in  his  public  statements,  I  think,  has  the  potential
for utilizing those resources very, very effectively.

I  think  that  taking  steps  at  the  smaller  end  of  the  spectrum  re-
quires  less  dollars,  but  has  dramatic  effects,  the  sub-orbital  pro-
gram, the research and analysis. Smaller missions such as Explor-
ers  or  systems—science  pathfinders,  these  are  things  that  can  be
worked  on,  can  be  relatively  readily  remedied,  compared  to  some
of  the  larger,  more  challenging  flagship  missions  in  the—so  I
strongly support what my colleagues have said, and I believe that,
from what I have seen, Alan is taking some very good initial steps
in this direction.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Dr. Baker. Dr. Burns.
Dr.  BURNS.  I  am  going  to  say  much  the  same.  Mainly,  we  need
to  support  the  core  infrastructure,  especially  R&A,  research  and
analysis funds. Making those funds difficult to obtain affects, espe-
cially  people  who  are  early  in  their  careers,  and  so  we  are  seeing
youth drift away.

And  that  is  something—the,  you  know,  if  the  work  force  drifts
away  to  other  areas,  and  if  technology  development  lags,  the  loss
to the program will become increasingly irreversible.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you,  panelists.  I  am  going  to,  at  this

point, yield five minutes to the Ranking Member, Mr. Calvert.

MEASURES TO REDUCE MISSION COSTS, SPECIFICALLY,

MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT AND RISK REDUCTION

Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  One  thing  that  we
heard,  I  think,  consistently  through  the  panel  was  reducing  mis-
sion costs.

I  think  I  will  start  with  you,  Dr.  Stern.  From  the  perspective  of
management and oversight and risk reduction, what measures can
NASA  take  that  would  provide  meaningful  help  to  reduce  mission
costs?  And  maybe  you  can  provide  some  management  examples  of,
you  know,  is  there  too  much  risk  reduction  work,  do  you  believe
there is unnecessary paperwork, other costs that are imposed upon
these  programs  that  make  the  investment  impractical?  And  after
you answer the question, I will ask the panel to add to the answer.
Dr. STERN. Yes, sir. Well, you and the panel members had point-
ed  this  whole  problem  out,  had  your  finger  on  something  very  im-
portant. We would, in fact, despite how ambitious, with 93 missions
in  development  or  flight,  and  our  program  is,  we  would,  in  fact,
have  more  missions  in  development  were  we  better  able  to  control
costs on the same budget. And so, I am setting out to do that.

Really,  our  missions  in  the  space  science  directorate  fall  in  two
categories.  There  are  principal  investigator  led  missions,  and  then
those larger missions that are done strategically at the centers.

With regard to the centers, Administrator Griffin has wisely put
in  place  a  new  policy  that  our  cost  estimating  will  be  done  at  the
70 percent confidence level, a much higher confidence level than in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

73

the past. This causes us to have a greater degree of realism as we
budget for missions.

We  have  to  marry  that  with  stronger  controls  so  that  we  stay
within that, but at least we are going to be able to begin now with
a  much  more  realistic  view  of  what  missions  cost  and  don’t  have
unrealistic expectations that are dashed.

With regard to principal-investigator led missions, some of those
have also run into problems. And we put in place a couple of things
that I think will help.

First, in this new Explorer announcement of opportunity that we
have  just  called  for,  and  which  will  be  out  later  this  year,  we  are
calling  for  a  minimum  experience  level  for  the  principal  investiga-
tors  themselves.  These  are  the  project  leaders,  the  scientist  that
runs the project.

Previously, there was no minimum experience level, so a scientist
who had not been involved in space flight could write a sufficiently
good  proposal  and  lead  a  team  to  a  win,  and  sometimes  that  gets
you  in  trouble.  You  know,  you  may  wake  up  in  the  morning  and
want  to  do  brain  surgery,  but  it  doesn’t  mean  that  you  can  do  it.
Space  flight  is  an  art,  and  I  think  this  is  an  important  new  step
that we are taking.

Let me mention just one other—we are going to be willing, in the
future, when missions get into trouble, and a principal investigator
is  not  controlling  the  cost  of  their  mission,  to  consider  and  then
execute on changing the principal investigator.

And  this  would  be  a  very  strong  feedback  loop,  because  to  the
principal  investigator,  and  I  speak  as  one  myself,  having  been  in-
volved  in  24  space  flight  missions,  that  the  only  incentive  for  the
scientist leader of the project is to collect and analyze the data and
make discoveries, not to carry out the project.

And  so,  the  control  mechanism  that  we  will  put  in  place,  where
the principal investigators know that their job is on the line as the
leader  if  they  can’t  perform,  if  their  view  of  a  P.I.  led  mission  is
that  the  P.I.  is  led  around,  then  they  are  at  risk,  and  we  will  find
somebody who can do it better, close and finish on schedule and on
cost.

Dr.  FISK.  Just  sort  of  a  corollary  statement,  perhaps.  It  is  kind
of two different directions that you can go at when you think about
what  missions  are  going  to  cost.  You  can  worry  about  what  they
are  likely  to  cost  in  advance,  you  can  cost  improperly.  We  haven’t
done  that  very  well  in  the  past,  and  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of
things in the works at the moment, even in the future decadals and
so forth, which will do a better job on that.

But  then  the  question  is,  does  it  have  to  cost  that  much?  Even
if  it  is  estimated  correctly,  did  it  have  to  cost  that  much?  And  the
question is, were there things that we could have done in the man-
agement  of  the  program,  or  the  execution  of  it,  not  only  to  control
the cost—we have an estimate, we try and reach the estimate cost.
You  say,  was  that  a  success?  Well,  it  was  a  success.  We  reached
the—we got the cost right. But perhaps there was a way to do the
mission  more  efficiently,  and  that  would  be  even  a  better  victory.
Not  only  did  we  come  in  on  cost,  but  the  cost  that  we  thought  it
was  going  to  be,  we  either  executed  it  for  less,  or  we  found  a  way

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

74

to  manage  this  program  in  such  a  way  that  the  cost  was  reduced.
We got more science for our dollars.

I think more emphasis on that latter point needs to be made, and
it comes down, particularly in this area of small and moderate mis-
sions. The question is, are we doing things that actually do reduce
risk,  or  are  we,  in  fact,  managing  in  such  a  way  that  we  are  com-
fortable?  We  have  reviewed  it,  we  have  paperwork.  We  are  sure
that  nothing  will  go  wrong,  but  we  wasted  money  in  deciding  that
because it either didn’t—it didn’t add to our risk reduction.

And  I  guess  what  the  community  is  sort  of  asking  of  NASA,
choose experienced P.I.s, that is a good thing. But if they are really
experienced,  let  them  do  the  program  in  such  a  way  that  they  can
produce this in the most cost effective way possible.

And so, there is an issue, then, of sort of driving—getting a part-
nership  with  NASA  that  we  get  the  missions  for  the  least  cost,
maximum security, minimum risk. Find the sweet spot.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Doctor.  My  time  has  expired.  I  will

come back for the second round.

Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Ranking Member Calvert. I would
like  to  turn  to  Dr.  Stern  at  this  point.  Doctor,  in  your  testimony
you  talked  with  a  lot  of  enthusiasm  about  being  an  advocate  of
human exploration, and then you went on to state that one of your
three guiding principles for SMD is to help the Vision for Space Ex-
ploration succeed.

PLANNED CHANGES IN THE SCIENCE MISSION DIRECTORATE

In specific terms, what changes do you plan to make to the goals,
priorities  and  plans  of  the  science  mission  directorate  to  help  the
vision for exploration succeed?

Dr.  STERN.  Yes,  sir.  Well,  I  see  two  things  that  we  should  be
doing.  The  first  is  supporting  the  Vision  for  Space  Exploration  by
providing  the  knowledge  necessary  to  return  to  the  Moon  and  to
Mars, particularly issues of astronaut safety.

Whether it is in heliospheric studies, understanding the Sun, the
radiation  environment,  for  example,  or  understanding  the  prop-
erties  of  lunar—the  size  and  density  of  the  Moon,  toxicity  of  Mar-
tian soils, whether Mars is biologically active and presents a threat
to our astronauts, et cetera. That is one area.

The other is we need to build a lunar science community. Really,
there  was  a  very  strong  lunar  science  community  during  Apollo.
And—but  when  the  Apollo  program  was  terminated,  the  lunar
science  research  and  analysis  funds  that  went  with  that,  and  the
data  analysis  funds  very  quickly  tapered  off.  And  today,  there  is
only a small remnant of that lunar science community.

The  Moon  is  a  fascinating  world.  An  in  member  silicate  planet,
it  has  a  kind  of  tenuous  surface  boundary  exosphere  that  is  the
most  common  type  of  atmosphere  in  the  solar  system.  Its  origin  is
intimately tied to the origin of the Earth, and the giant impact that
we believe occurred to create the Moon. I could go on and on.

This  is  a  ripe  scientific  area,  waiting  for  us  to  help  it  flower,  in
the  same  way  that  15  years  ago  the  decimated  Mars  science  com-
munity  from  the  1970’s  was  brought  back  by  a  series  of  a  robotic
Mars  missions,  beginning  after  the  demise  of  the  Mars  Observer.

Doctor?

And  now,  we  have  a  very  strong  Mars  science  community.  I  want
to do the same with lunar science.

Chairman  UDALL.  Any  of  the  other  witnesses  care  to  comment?

Dr. ILLINGWORTH. Yes, thank you. At—maybe at some slight risk
of  disagreeing  with  the  A.A.,  but  I  would  like  to  comment  on  this.
In  the  sense  that,  while  I  think  there  are  opportunities  with  re-
gard to lunar science, it is very important when opportunities come
up,  they  are  chosen  for  other  reasons,  that  the  science  community
think about that in the context of its broad goals.

And  so,  this  is  obviously  been  something  that  has  happened  re-
cently,  as  folks  have  started  to  think  about  missions  on—that  we
would  put  on  the  Moon  versus  elsewhere.  But  it  does  need  to  be
done  in  the  broad  context.  I  don’t  think  that  we  want  to  find  that
we  are  driven  to  do  things  on  the  Moon  because  we  are  there.  It
is not of the higher scientific priority.

So,  encompassing  all  solar  system  objectives,  for  example,  dis-
cussing that and choosing the opportunities that arise from having
access to the Moon is good, but in context. Thank you.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Baker.
Dr.  BAKER.  I  would  like  to  just  comment—I  had  the  privilege  of
chairing  a  recent  ad  hoc  committee  for  the  NRC  that  was  looking
at  the  radiation  risk  for  the  human  space  exploration  program.  I
just  want  to  endorse  what  Dr.  Stern  said.  I  think  that  the
heliophysics  community  in  particular  is  excited,  and  I  think  quite
capable  of  developing  new  predictive  models,  and  I  think  would
gladly  undertake  the  effort  to  help  provide  information  that  would
be very enabling for the Vision for Space Exploration.

But as with all things, this has to be balanced against the other
basic  kind  of  understanding  that  we  need,  and  the  programs  that
we  have  talked  about  today,  I  think,  can  contribute  some  of  that
basic knowledge that can then be converted into very effective pre-
dictive models.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Fisk.
Dr. FISK. I just have one comment on the scientific activities that
are—that  you—on  the  lunar  science,  and  the  exciting  things  that
can  be  done  there.  The  science  mission  director  some  time  ago
asked  the  NRC  to  do  a  study  on  science  to  be  done  on  the  Moon,
or  lunar  science  to  be  done  in  advance  of  and  at  the  beginning  of
the human exploration of the Moon.

That  report  will  come  out  shortly.  There  was  an  interim  report
earlier, and if you—I haven’t—I can’t comment on the final report,
but the interim report pointed out a number of very important sci-
entific topics that involved the Moon that need to be pursued.
Chairman UDALL. Dr. Burns, do you have anything to add?
Dr.  BURNS.  Well,  the  science  that  can  be  done  on  the  Moon  is
useful,  certainly.  I  think,  on  the  other  hand,  that  there—the—we
need  the  background  knowledge  in  order  to  have  a  successful
human  exploration  program,  and  I  think  that  if  the  purpose  of
being  there  is  to  get  that  knowledge,  then  probably  those  funds
should  come  from  the  exploration  program  rather  than  from  the
science director.

Chairman UDALL. The Chair recognizes Mr. Calvert for five min-

utes. Thank you.

UNDERSTATING TRUE COSTS

Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  going  to  stick
with  the  mission—for  a  little  bit.  Dr.  Illingworth,  obviously  you
commented  about  astrophysics  is  at  risk  because  of  the  drop  that
we  may  experience  down  the  road,  but  one  of  the  things  that  I
want you to comment about is the understating, sometimes, of true
cost  when  we  get  in  these  large  programs,  and,  specifically,  the
James  Webb  Space  Telescope  which  now  is,  I  believe,  four  times
the  cost  that  came  up  in  the  decadal  survey,  four  times  the  cost.
And  obviously  when  we  in  Congress  try  to  determine  what  dol-
lars  we  are  going  to  set  aside  for  future  missions,  it  makes  it  ex-
tremely difficult when we have to, basically, take all the money out
of  these  various  programs  and  fund  what  you  obviously  believe  is
a very important instrument that we are going to put up. Any com-
ment about that? Because I think that is probably the most obvious
one out there that is just out of whack right now.

Dr.  ILLINGWORTH.  Yes,  certainly.  I  think  that  cost  estimation  is
critical  to  our  credibility  as  a  community,  and  to  NASA’s  credi-
bility.  We  work  together  on  these  activities,  and  NASA  provides
input to the decadal survey. I think the input that was given then
was  not  optimal,  and  I  think  that  we  in  the  community  and  the
folks  in  the  survey  didn’t  ask  the  right  questions,  or  think  in  the
right context.

And  as  I  mentioned,  JWST  was  a  very  significant  example,  but
there  are  others  as  well  that  we  are  dealing  with  that  has  led  to
major  changes  in  the  current  program  because  of  those  collective
cost growth.

And  though  think  the  crucial  thing  here  is,  of  course,  getting
independent estimates of the cost, thinking about the costs over the
full  life  cycle,  over  the  10  to  15  years  that  the  decadal  survey  is
referring  to,  and  not  just  construction  costs.  Asking  questions  of
the  proponents  and  trying  to  fully  understand  what  it  is  they  are
proposing.

I think if we understood the costs better as we are discussing the
science  missions,  it  would  also  help  us  frame  the  resulting  prior-
ities much better, that we would not bring forward a program that
was  so  much  larger  than  is  likely  to  be  doable  in  a  given  decade,
with so many attendant problems that come from that.

So  there  are,  I  think,  ways  that  this  can  be  done.  I  think  just
by  asking  the  right  questions,  by  thinking  in  the  right  way,  and  I
get  a  very  strong  sense  from  all  the  folks  who  are  thinking  about
the  next  decadal  survey  that  we  are  all  on  the  same  wavelength
here.

We  do  not  want  to  repeat  what  we  have  done  in  the  last  two  or
three  Decadal  Surveys.  We  want  to  get  more  accurate  cost  esti-
mates. We want to test them independently. We want to have peo-
ple  involved  who  have  recognition  of  mission  cost  development  in
the process, and we want to have NASA work with us on that and
try  and  give  us  the  best  cost  estimates  based  on  their  very  exten-
sive experience.

STATUS AND IMPACT OF DELTA 2 LAUNCHER

Mr.  CALVERT.  One  of  the  things  that  we  are  going  to  experience
here  in  the  near  future,  obviously,  is  the  discontinuation  of  the
Delta  2  launcher,  and  what  that  will  do  to  launch  costs,  how  are
we going to manifest payloads, and what are we going to put it on?
I would like to hear some comments from you. Obviously, there are
some  folks  out  there  trying  to  come  up  with  less  expensive  ways
to get to a low-Earth orbit, but I want to hear from you.

Maybe  we  will  start  with  Dr.  Stern  about  how  are  we  going  to

do this here in the next decade?

Dr. STERN. Yes, sir, it is a very important issue. Our Delta 2 in-
ventory  allows  us  to  fly  out  all  of  the  missions  through  2012  that
we  planned  to  fly,  and  we  do  have  some  smaller  launchers,  for  ex-
ample  Pegasus  and  Taurus.  The  Pegasus  launched  two  small  ex-
plorers  this  year,  including  the  A  mission  that  Dan  Baker  spoke
about that just launched last week and is doing very well on orbit.
We  are  additionally—I  mean  the  Agency—looking  at  some  alter-
natives to, or additions, to those possibilities to give us low-cost ac-
cess  to  space  again  for  small  and  moderate-sized  missions.  Those
decisions  have  not  been  made,  but  I  can  assure  you  that  it  is  im-
portant, not only to the science-mission directorate, but to the larg-
er agency.

Dr. FISK. We are all encouraged that NASA has got this on their
agenda to do because, I mean, there is a very simple problem here
that  the  range  of  the  Delta  2—this  has  been  the  workhorse  of  the
science-mission  directorate  since  the  beginning  of  the  space  pro-
gram,  and  so  everything  is  sized  for  this,  whether  it  is  the  size  of
your  chambers  that  you  build  satellites  for.  And  so  the  idea  is,  if
you don’t have that capability, there is a whole range of things that
you will not be able to do, and there will be a whole range of things
that you will have to make adaptations to your infrastructure to be
able to do in the absence of that vehicle.

So  it  needs  to  be  a  problem  that  is  solved,  and  I—it  has  to  be
a  robust  solution,  and  I—you  know,  this  is  not  something  the  Na-
tion—and  the  Delta—it  can’t  be  simply,  you  know,  keep  the  Delta
2  alive,  because  that  will  probably  be  too  expensive  of  a  solution.
Someone  needs  to  comes  up  with  a  less  expensive  solution,  or  at
least comparably expensive solution, and the assurance needs to be
there to have that happen.

Dr.  BAKER.  I  would  like  to  comment  I  support  strongly  the  idea
that the Delta 2 provides the sweet spot for many missions in plan-
etary  science  and  heliophysics.  I  also  believe  that  if  we  lost  that
kind  of  capability,  we  are  going  to—this  is  going  to  propagate
through the system in a number of ways.

Going to larger launch vehicles immediately adds tens of millions
of  dollars  to  the  mission  cost,  and  by  sort  of  taking  the  cap  off  of
mass  constraints  and  things  like  that,  it  can  also  allow  for  unex-
pected  growth  in  mission  that—just  as  I  say,  it  compounds  itself
over  and  over  again,  and  I  think  that  we  would  be  well  advised  to
try to restore that capability or make sure that we have something
that is very comparable to the Delta 2 to enable these missions.

Dr.  BURNS.  The  same  thing,  especially  for  the  low-cost  mission
like  Discovery,  this  is  a  critical  issue,  because  in  percentage-basis,

78

once  you  start  increasing  your  launch  costs  by  a  few  ten  of  mis-
sions of dollars, percentage-wise, that is just staggering, very dam-
aging.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  think  if  the  panel  is  willing  to  do  so  we  will
engage  in  another  round  here.  It  is  been  very  helpful.  Dr.  Stern,
let  us  talk  a  little  bit  about  New  Horizons,  if  you  would,  and  I
would  note  for  the  record  that  of  you  many  talents,  you  have  also
been considered for the astronaut corps, and I don’t know whether
that is still on the possible list of undertakings that you would pur-
sue. I know you have got——

Dr. STERN. Kind of a busy day job right now.
Chairman  UDALL.  Yes,  you  have  got  a  day  job,  but  we  will  see
what we can do. I think there are some people in the country who
would  like  to  send  Congressman  Calvert  and  myself  to  Pluto,  but
that is another discussion topic.

Dr. STERN. I would love to have you bring a sample back.

APPLICATION OF SPACE RESEARCH EXPERIENCE TO NASA

SPACE SCIENCE PROGRAMS

Chairman  UDALL.  Are  there  any  lessons  that  you  have  learned
from  your  space-research  experience  that  you  want  to  apply  to
NASA space-science programs, and if you see some of those, would
you outline them a little bit for us?

Dr.  STERN.  Sure,  absolutely.  Well,  it  is  been  a  privilege  for  my
peers and for the Agency, when I was on the other side, on the so-
called  receiving  end  of  the  bureaucracy,  to  be  given  the  responsi-
bility  to  lead  space  missions  and  space  instruments,  and  I  found
two  things  were  absolutely  required  to  do  a  good  job:  one  was  a
complete commitment of time and resources, personal time and re-
sources,  on  the  part  of  the  PI  to  the  project;  and  to  realize  that
when you have been entrusted with that kind of responsibility that
other aspects of you professional career should be secondary to the
very great responsibility of carrying out that mission. For example,
I made a conscious and public decision to reduce the rate at which
I was writing research papers while we were getting New Horizons
built, and I think that PIs would be wise to do that in general and
to  keep  their  eyes  on  the  ball,  and  to  get  commitments  from  their
university or their institution to remove them from management or
teaching responsibilities. After all, we are talking about entrusting
those individuals with $100 million to $1 billion project. This is big
science. It is a big enterprise by any standard.

The second and other area I will speak to has to deal with being
the  adult  in  the  room  or  being  able  to  say  no  to  control  require-
ments,  and  not  just  the  scientific  requirements  on  a  mission,  but
also the engineers who oftentimes or almost always want to please,
and yet sometimes, I found, that we went a little overboard in that
regard, and I was able to make a contribution to simplify what we
were  doing  and  that  always  paid  off,  because  in  the  end,  we  were
always short on money trying to finish, and some of those decisions
made early on that were painful really paid off because in the end,
what matters is that you get a successful mission out of it, and you
know,  the  best  gilded  lily  that  is  still  a  bird  on  the  ground  doesn’t
get  you  very  far  in  terms  of  scientific  return.  I  would  offer  those
two things.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  Those  were  very  insightful,  and
you certainly come with a great deal of experience, and I think that
is  why  you  are  the  right  person  for  the  job  at  this  particular  job,
given all of your experience as a PI.

I turn back to the panel, and I think this may be slightly redun-
dant,  but  we  really  want  to  drill  into  this.  Over  the  next  couple  of
months,  we  are  going  to  be  deciding  on  the  ’08  appropriation  for
NASA,  and  I  would  like  to  ask  each  one  of  you  what  is  the  most
important  what  NASA  could  do  in  the  ’08  NASA  appropriation  to
strengthen the space-science programs?

’08 APPROPRIATIONS PRIORITIES TO STRENGTHEN SPACE

SCIENCE PROGRAMS

Okay, we will start over here, Dr. Burns, and we will come back

this way. How is that?

Dr. BURNS. I am going to say the same thing again. We have got
a consistent message here, and it is we need funding for R&A sup-
port,  and  we  need  to  keep  our  young  people  here,  and  we  need  to
make  use  of  the  data  that  we  are  getting  so  that  we  can  under-
stand  the  places  that  we  are  visiting  and  so  that  we  can  better
plan our future missions.

Chairman UDALL. Dr. Baker.
Dr. BAKER. Yes, I agree that the research and analysis and sub-
orbital, as we have talked about. I feel very passionately about the
Explorer  program  and  like  programs.  I  think  that  these  offer  so
much.  They  return  wonderful  science.  They  give  a  chance  for
hands-on  engineering,  hands-on  science  education,  and  they  give
the kind of frequency and cadence of missions that really build en-
thusiasm  through  the  community  and  through  the  country,  I  be-
lieve,  so  I  think  that  is  a  real  place  to  put  resources,  if  possible.
Chairman  UDALL.  When  I  see  you,  of  course,  all  I  think  about—
well,  not  all  I  think  about,  but  a  lot  of  what  I  think  about  is  the
University of Colorado students that I have seen running satellites,
being engaged, excited, committed to a long-term career and to the
program in general.

Dr.  BAKER.  We  have  60  graduate  students,  60  undergraduate
students.  Many  of  the  undergraduates  are  operating  spacecraft,
and it is just a marvelous thing and it builds a cadre of people that
go out into industry, and they do marvelous things.

Chairman UDALL. Doctor?
Dr.  ILLINGWORTH.  Yes,  I  think  I  used  the  word  seed  corn  before.
I  think  R&A  is—on  the  human  front,  on  the  people  side,  is  what
is  critically  important  here  in  investing  for  the  future,  and  this  is
for NASA’s benefit as well. NASA will have its science program, its
most striking results, with a strong community behind it. And then
I  would  add  to  that  the  Explorer  level,  the  cost-capped,  moderate-
sized missions as being very important for getting returns quickly,
and providing very high scientific leverage for the money.

Chairman UDALL. And Dr. Fisk.
Dr.  FISK.  I  am  probably  bolder  than  my  colleague  here  on  this
issue.  Let  me  come  at  it  from  the  very  top.  I  hope  when  the  ’08
budget  is  considered,  you  will  keep  recognizing  how  much  money
NASA  has  lost  from  what  the  President  said  it  could  have  for  its
budget  when  he  announced  the  vision  for  exploration,  and  I  am

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

80

talking  several  billions  of  dollars.  And  then,  if  you  add  to  the
things  that  were  not  in  the  budget,  such  as  the  return-to-flight  of
the Shuttle and new initiatives, such as Earth science, you are way
off. And so, if you, then, can recognize at that level, then of course,
it  feeds  down  to  the  science.  Science  can  have  some  of  its  funding
restored,  and  the  investments  that  need  to  be  made  at  that  time
are the kinds of investments—there are two investments, actually.
A lot of things were decelerated that should be accelerated, and the
R&A funds and the future of the program needs to be restored.

But  I  don’t  think  we  should  lose  sight  of  the  big  picture  here,
which is science is only one of the abused parts of the NASA budg-
et,  and  the  whole  budget  is  several  billion  dollars  short.  It  is  sev-
eral  billion  dollars  short  from  the  authorization  amount  that  your
committee put into effect when you authorized the New Vision, and
we have to drive it back to those kinds of levels.

Chairman  UDALL.  Thank  you.  I  am  going  recognize  Mr.  Calvert
here, again, but I just want to make a note that I was anticipating
leaving  it  to  the  end  of  the  hearing,  but  I  think  this  appropriate
on the heels of what has been said, that Chairman Gordon and my-
self  have  written  to  the  President,  asking  him  to  meet  with  Con-
gress  to  address  the  funding  challenges  facing  NASA.  Ranking
Member  Calvert  and  other  Members  have  made  a  similar  request.
We will see where that leads.

It  is  my  pleasure  to  recognize  my  friend  and  the  Ranking  Mem-

ber, Mr. Calvert, again, for another five minutes.

Mr.  CALVERT.  I  point  out  to  my  friend  and  Chairman  that  also
we  have  an  appropriations  process  that  we  need  to  support,  and  I
hope  that  all  of  you—I  know  that  Dr.  Stern  is  in  the  position  of
supporting  the  President’s  budget,  and  I  would  hope,  at  the  very
least, we can hit that mark. But as you know, under the continuing
resolution,  we  took  a  $500  million  hit,  and  we  want  to  make  sure
that  our  friends  don’t  believe  that  that  is  the  new  baseline  for  the
NASA  budget,  or  all  of  the  NASA  budget  will  be  deeply  impacted
even worse than it is today, so we need to hear support to educate
Members of Congress to the importance of it.

While  we  are  on  the  research  and  analysis  activities,  and  obvi-
ously  you  all  believe.  I  will  turn  to  Dr.  Stern  for  this  answer,  but
he  can  listen  to  it.  What  do  you  believe  is  the  metric  or  rule  of
thumb that should be used to suggest how NASA establish the ap-
propriate amount of money to put into this, and should it be a fixed
level,  should  it  be  money  provided  by  a  certain  percentage?  What
are  your  suggestions,  because  that  is  certainly  an  ongoing,  I  am
sure, discussion within your committee.

R&A BUDGETING

I will start on the right this time.
Dr.  BURNS.  Thank  you.  I  really  appreciate  you  always  starting

with me.

The planetary decadal panel considered this issue, and as a rule
of  thumb,  they  felt  that  something  like  25  percent  of  the  budget
that  is  being  used  for  the  mission  costs  would  be  an  appropriate
percentage, and we are well below that. We were well below it even
before the fiscal year 2005 cut in the R&A funds by 25 percent.

Mr. CALVERT. Dr. Baker, do you agree with that?

Dr.  BAKER.  Thank  you  for  keeping  me  to  second,  but  it  still
hasn’t  helped  me  too  much  to  come  up  with  a  formula  to  answer
your question but my impression is that we were better a few years
back than we are now. I think that the kinds of cuts that have oc-
curred  and  the  kind  of  bailing  out  of  other  things  at  the  expense
of  the  research  and  analysis  across  the  board  in  all  of  the  dis-
ciplines  has  been  very,  very  detrimental.  But  I  think  we  recognize
that  there  is  too  little  now.  What  would  be  optimal  or  what  would
be healthiest? I don’t think that has been totally established. Each
of  the  disciplines  treats  research  and  analysis  somewhat  dif-
ferently, and I am very encouraged that—again, that Alan Stern is
focusing on this and have a person, Yvonne, who is really going to
focus  on  R&A  specifically  and  look  at  the  question  that  you  have
asked in a very systemic way. I think it is very important.

Dr. ILLINGWORTH. Yes. Let me add my thoughts on this. I would
like to distinguish that there are two components to the R&A area.
Very broadly, one is the data analysis that goes explicitly with the
operating missions, and NASA has been very good at funding these
and  with  the  goal,  of  course,  that  one  maximized  the  scientific  re-
turn  from  a  very  substantial  investment  by  the  Nation  in  these
projects.

I think that the 25 percent number would be wonderful to have.
I  think  none  of  our  current  missions  come  close  to  that.  I  suspect
that  it  would  be—I  actually  think  it  would  be  useful  to  do  an  as-
sessment of this question and ask what may well be needed. There
was  one  many  years  ago,  in  fact,  two  decades  ago,  that  was  done
for  Hubble,  but  I  am  not  aware  of  any  more  recent  assessments,
and maybe this is something that NRC might like to do across the
various programs.

The  second  part,  of  course,  is  R&A  itself,  which  tends  to  be  a
grab bag for a lot of activities, from technology development, to the-
ory,  to  reworking  data  sets.  And  those  individual  elements,  prob-
ably,  are  the  areas  that  need  to  be  considered  instead  of  looking
at the overall picture, and trying to assess whether or not the fund-
ing  that  is  being  put  into  those  areas,  like  theory,  is  really  ade-
quate  for  the  returns  that  we  are  getting  for  the  investment  that
we  are  putting  in  on  the  mission  side,  and  the  data  analysis  side.
Certainly,  I  think  my  theory  colleague  think  it  is  not,  but  doing
it—finding metrics to do that is a challenge, but it may well be that
the right approach here is to think about doing this in a somewhat
systematic way.

Dr. FISK. I have a similar sort of answer. The mission-operations
data-analysis  costs  are  the  easiest  to  figure  out  because  you  sort
of know what it is that you are costing to operate the mission, and
you  want  to  get  the  maximum  number  of  years  out  of  things,  so
you  get  the  maximum  return  on  investment.  You  do  that  calcula-
tion, and you add it up.

One of the questions that is the hardest one is on technology de-
velopment,  training  of  the  next  generation,  theory  and  so  forth.  It
all comes together. And there, I think you have to go in sort of dis-
cipline  by  discipline,  and  you  have  to  ask  yourself  the  question—
and  this  is  a  question  that  NASA  can  perform  the  analysis—and
say  what  does  this  community  need  to  have  a  future?  If  the  com-
munity  is  aging  and  aging  rapidly,  and  there  needs  to  be  an  infu-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00085 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

82

sion  of  new  talent,  that  focuses  some  of  that  money  on  this.  If  it
is not, then, maybe less money is needed. You need theory because
no one knows what it is this data means. You know you need that,
and  so  on.  But  you  need—it  will  vary  from  discipline  to  discipline.
The  analysis  needs  to  be  made  and  the  funding  provided  because
we  all  agree  on  the  goal.  The  question  is  what  is  the  right  way?

Mr. CALVERT. Thank you. My time has expired.
Chairman UDALL. Thank you, Congressman Calvert.

INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION

Dr.  Stern,  if  I  could  come  back  to  you,  in  your  testimony  you
state  that  you  plan  to  increase  international  collaboration  as  a
means to advance the priorities of the National Academy’s decadal
surveys.  While  international  survey—excuse  me.  While  inter-
national  collaboration  can  provide  scientific  and  other  benefits  to
both  parties,  it  can  also  lead  to  increased  costs  and  delays.  What
actions do you intend to take to reduce the costs and programmatic
risks  of  such  collaborations?  And  we  did  talk  about  this  when  we
met.  It  is  exciting  area,  and  I  will  give  you  a  chance  to  talk  about
that as well.

Dr.  STERN.  Yes,  sir.  Well,  I  do  think  that  there  are  other  ways
besides throwing money at problems to increase the productivity of
this program, and we are looking at cost controls, as I spoke to ear-
lier. We are conducing a zero-based review across all four divisions
to see what may have been important in the past that is not impor-
tant now, and international collaboration is yet another way to ac-
complish that. And to be quite frank, any country who is on an ac-
ceptable list, who has the space programming capability that could
fly  our  instruments  or  collaborate  on  missions  is  somebody  that  I
want to talk to. And I mean that to be a win-win. Certainly, Asian
nations  like  the  Japanese  and  the  Indians,  who  are  space  powers,
the  European  Space  Agency,  the  European  national  space  pro-
grams, the Canadian Space Agency, and other all come to mind.

One  important,  new  element  of  international  collaboration  that
addresses  what  you  are  asking  about  is  the  possibility  that  we
could  collaborate,  instead,  at  the  hardware  level  within  a  mission,
where  different  parties,  NASA  and  a  foreign  partner,  for  example,
divide up who builds which part of the spacecraft and the payload.
Instead,  we  would  collaborate  at  higher,  more  strategic  level,  at  a
mission  level,  so  that  for  example,  a  given  foreign  partner  might
want to build an astrophysics missions that we are very interested
in  and  that  is  close  to  something  in  our  decadal  survey,  and  yet,
we might be able to build a mission, a planetary mission for exam-
ple, that is of interest to that party. And they would go about their
business; we would go about ours; but have a science team formed
from both nations or both parties, so that there is very little swap-
ping  of  hardware,  software,  technology,  but  that  the  science  data
analysis  is  win-win  for  both  parties  and  the  field  advances  more
rapidly than might otherwise.

Chairman  UDALL.  It  seems  to  me  there  is  a  great  deal  of  room
here in which to maneuver and develop some of these new relation-
ships.  I  want  to  commend  you  for  taking  a  hard  look  at  this  and
moving ahead.

about the.

Dr.  BURNS.  One  of  my  concerns  is  the  fact  that  ITAR  automati-
cally considers satellite technology to be munitions under the State
Department  rules,  and  that  really  hamstrings  us  in  interacting
with  other  nations.  I  have  cases  of  post-docs  who  have  written
code, going back to Germany and France, and they can’t access the
code that they wrote because they are foreigners.

I  think  another  issue  is—and  this,  I  know,  is  a  no-no—but  a
question  of  whether  or  not  to  consider  other  launch  vehicles  than
American  launch  vehicles  because  competition,  according  to  Amer-
ica  is  a  good  thing,  and  I  wonder  if  that  might  lower  the  cost  in
some way.

And  finally,  of  course,  we  need  to  be  firm  and  make  sure  that
when  we  say  we  are  going  to  do  something,  we  carry  it  out.  At
present,  we  tend  to  drag  things  on  and  then  sometimes  stop,  and
that does not make for good international relations.
Chairman UDALL. Anyone else care to comment?
Dr. BAKER. Well, I would just like to add on the ITAR issue that
I agree that is seems inappropriate to be stifling what we are able
to  do  with  foreign  partners,  and  I  know  that  the  NRC  is  going  to
have a workshop this fall and kind of look further into what effect
this  is  having  on  the  space  program,  and  perhaps  what  could  be
done  to  remedy  it.  I  couldn’t  agree  more  that  seizing  all  possibili-
ties  for  foreign  launchers,  for  foreign  missions  of  opportunity  or  a
much  stronger  collaboration,  it  just  seems  to  me  it  offers  tremen-
dous possibilities of leveraging the resources that we have.

Chairman UDALL. Anyone else? Dr. Illingworth.
Dr.  ILLINGWORTH.  Yes,  just  to  comment  on  this,  I  think  it  really
can be win-win with international partnerships, and I actually was
intrigued  by  Alan’s  idea  of  creating,  in  some  sense,  different  mis-
sions,  ensuring  access.  I  think  that  is  a  very  good  approach.  It
probably isn’t a way that will work, necessarily, for the very largest
and  rarest  missions,  but  probably  more  for  medium.  And  there  is
actually—from my hat that I war as the AAAC Chair, I also think
across the other agencies as well, and we are also trying to encour-
age  active  collaborations  where  practical,  and  particularly  with
DOE  on  missions  as  well,  with  their  science  interests.  And  some-
thing,  they  are  also  as  challenging  because  of  the  different  ap-
proaches and culture.

Chairman  UDALL.  Dr.  Fisk,  has  it  all  been  said,  or  would  you

like to add?

Dr. FISK. I think it is all been said.
Chairman UDALL. There is an old Washington saying that it has
all  been  said,  but  not  everybody  said  it,  so  I  don’t  want  to  cut  you
off, but I think you all have given us a homework assignment. Mr.
Calvert  and  I  have  been  speaking  up  here  about  ITAR  and  trying
to  find  a  sweet  spot  to  give  on  our  national  security  concerns,  but
also, we are actually putting ourselves at competitive——

Dr.  FISK.  I  will  add  to  that.  I  encourage  you  to  do  something.  It
has become a nightmare, and is probably the single biggest impedi-
ment to international cooperation in the science program.

Chairman  UDALL.  I  am  happy,  again,  to  recognize  Mr.  Calvert

for five minutes.

Mr.  CALVERT.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  agree  that  we  need
to  come  up  with  some  solution  on  ITAR,  but  obviously,  we  both
serve on the Armed Services Committee, also, and as we all know,
the technology can be not just for peaceful purposes.

STATUS OF EUROPA MISSION

One question, because I am going to have to go out to a markup,
regarding  the  Europa  mission,  I  want  to  get  all  of  your  thoughts
regarding  the  relative  importance  of  sending  a  satellite  to  Europa,
versus  other  moons  that  may  harbor  water,  such  as  Enceladus  or
Titan.  I  know  at  one  time,  the  planetary  community  seemed  com-
mitted  to  launching  a  Europa  mission,  but  with  the  findings  from
Cassini,  has  anyone  kind  of  shifted  or  changed  their  mind  and
want  to  look  at  something  else?  I  was  just  kind  of  curious.  I  will
start with you again, Dr. Burns.

Dr. BURNS. Man, you are my friend. That is a very difficult ques-
tion because the results that we have gotten from the Cassini mis-
sion  on  both  Enceladus  and  Titan  are  of  great  importance.  They
show  the  possibility  of  conditions  that  are  appropriate  for  the  for-
mation  of  life,  both  the  presence  of  water  and  organics  and  energy
sources,  much  like  Europa.  I  think  that  there  is  a  benefit  for  con-
tinuity in the program, however, and the Europa mission continues
to be a very exciting mission. I believe that since there—NASA has
put forward a million dollars for each of four studies to look at the
two missions that you mentioned and two in the Jovian system, in-
cluding the Europa mission. I think we will have an answer to this
question.

Dr. BAKER. Thank you. Planetary science is part of what my lab-
oratory  does,  and  I  am  just  struck  by  what  a  target-rich  environ-
ment planetary science is. Everywhere you turn there is something,
there is an object, that would just be wonderful to visit in more de-
tail,  and  I  am  not  prepared  to  say  which  of  those—and  my  plan-
etary  friends  probably  can  make  a  judgment  about  that—but  it  is
just  astonishing.  Had  we  the  resources,  I  think  there  are  just  a
very large number of objects that would be worth investing, and we
would  learn  a  great  deal  about  the  universe  beyond  by  studying
them.

Dr. ILLINGWORTH. Just to note here, this is really an area which
is  beyond—well,  maybe  inside  astrophysics.  Astrophysics  starts
outside  of  the  solar  system,  so  I  don’t  have  an  explicit  comment.

Mr. CALVERT. Dr. Fisk.
Dr.  FISK.  Well,  the  Europa  mission,  you  know,  was  a  priority  in
the decadal survey, and I have, sort of, two comments on that. One
is  it  was,  and  we  need  to  take  that  into  account  because  the  com-
munity  consensus  that  is  where  you  should  go.  The  second  thing
is  it  probably  points  out  one  of  the  issues  that  we  need  to  always
deal with in decadals, and will have to deal with the next one that
is  starting  up  in  a  year  or  so,  which  is  as  new  science  comes  in,
how do you decide whether or not you should stick to your previous
recommendations or you should move to some other target because
we learned something? Well, I think there is a lesson in the Europa

discussion for the future decadals, and also, that we need to simply
make intelligent decisions now as to how to do this.

Mr. CALVERT. Flexibility. Dr. Stern.
Dr.  STERN.  Yes,  if  I  could  speak  to  this  point:  it  is  a  very  rare
and special opportunity to be able to fly a flagship in any field, in-
cluding  in  planetary  science.  Outer-planet  flagships  come  approxi-
mately every quarter century. I think it is our responsibility as pro-
gram  leaders  in  NASA  to  take  a  careful  look  at  the  new  data  that
is  coming  in,  for  example  from  Cassini,  and  the  excitement  that
that  has  generated  and  not  simply  genuflect  to  decision  made  be-
fore that data was available. We might come back to the same con-
clusion  that  Europa  is  the  mission  to  fly,  and  we  might  find  that
the  community  consensus  is  that  this  is  just  such  a  special  oppor-
tunity, we only have one, it should be different target.

But  I  think  that  we  absolutely  have  the  responsibility  to  make
that  decision  consciously  and  not  implicitly  or  simply  because  of  a
report written years ago.

Mr. CALVERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I have to go to a mark-
up,  so  I  thank  the  witnesses  for  attending  today  and  look  forward
to seeing you again soon. Thank you.

Mr.  WU.  [Presiding]  Thank  the  Ranking  Member,  and  our  new

Ranking Member.

CHINESE COOPERATION

The Chairman recognizes himself for five minutes. We had some
discussion of ITAR earlier and perhaps we will return to that sub-
ject because it is related to what I intend to ask about. Over three
decades  ago,  at  a  time  when  our  relationship  with  the  then-Soviet
Union  was  not  on  the  friendliest  of  terms,  we  initiated  some  co-
operation  in  human  space  flight,  which  has  born  significant  fruit
and  perhaps  given  us  an  opportunity  to  find  areas  of  cooperation
as well as share some costs. Many of the problems that we face in
space  exploration  today  whether  they  are  human  exploration  or
robotic missions, you know, the stress is on matching the resources
with  the  mission.  The  Chinese  have  a  vigorous  space  program
going  as  well  as  a  vigorous  economy.  There  are  obviously  some
challenges  in  developing  any  human  space  flight  cooperation  pro-
grams  with  the  Chinese  because  of  the  structure  of  their  human
space  flight  program  but  I  would  like  the  panel  of  witnesses,  in
particular  Dr.  Stern,  to  comment  on  the  potential  for  cooperation
in human space exploration as the Chinese develop their space pro-
gram  and  also  whether  this  might  potentially  help  us  match  mis-
sion and budget.

Dr.  STERN.  Yes,  sir.  As  you  well  know,  the  Administrator  has
said  that  the  return  to  the  Moon  and  the  eventual  exploration  of
Mars  by  human  beings  is  a  program  that  the  United  States  and
NASA  is  very,  very  open  to  international  participation.  We  would
like  to  provide  the  core  infrastructure  and  have  other  partners,
other nations and multi-national space programs such as the Euro-
pean  Space  Agency  or  others  come  in  and  participate  and  add  to
the value of what we are doing.

Mr. WU. Dr. Fisk or any other of the panelists?
Dr.  FISK.  This  is  stretching  the  limits  of  my—I  suppose  like  any
good university professor, I am supposed to have an opinion on ev-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

erything.  I  mean,  it  is—I  mean,  clearly  you  raise  the  early  issues,
which  is,  you  know,  how  do  we  cooperate,  you  know,  in  ITAR  in
particular  and  so  that  will  be  an  impediment,  particularly  in  deal-
ing  with  the  Chinese.  I  think  the  thing  the  country  needs  to  be
most  concerned  about  when  we  decide  whether  we  are  going  to  do
these things cooperatively, how we are going to do them, is the fact
that  if  we  choose  not  to,  there  are  alignments  that  will  take  place
among other nations whether it is the Chinese and Russians or the
Russians  and  the  Chinese,  and  so  various  things  could  take  place
and  we  could  find  ourselves  in  a  space  race  with  the  world,  and
that would probably be an unwise position. So the figuring out how
to  cooperate  in  a  way  that  we  sort  of  use  the  world’s  resources  is
probably not only a wise offensive strategy on our part, it is a wise
defensive strategy.

Dr. ILLINGWORTH. Let me just comment on this. You know, ITAR
is  a  significant  concept  for  the  community  and  it  is  right  at  the
working  level.  Alan  mentioned  the  possibility  of  doing  missions
where  the  primary  responsibility  was  taken  by  an  international
partner but there was a joint science team, but that in itself poses
problems because the science team that we had that involved inter-
national  scientists,  getting  into  many  of  the  technology  areas  may
determine  whether  or  not  one  can  carry  out  the  science  and  those
sort  of  discussions  are  very  challenging  to  do  with  ITAR  regula-
tions,  and  it  has  been  an  impediment  to  bringing  together  inter-
national  teams,  even  on  smaller  programs.  So  it  does  have  a  sub-
stantial impact at a level which is often not recognized. It narrows
the  expertise  and  the  involvement  that  you  would  like  to  use  on
these programs. So, the hope, of course, is very broadly in the com-
munity  that  there  are  ways  in  which  this  can  be  changed  for  a  lot
of the missions that we would like to carry out.

Mr. WU. Dr. Baker.
Dr. BAKER. I would just say that cooperation done well and wise-
ly can be very cost-effective and can use scarce resources very well.
I think forcing cooperation in unnatural ways or ways that are not
going  to  be  well  thought  out  could  very  well  drive  up  the  cost  to
the  United  States  and  so  I  think  that  it  is  very,  very  important  to
think through thoroughly what is the appropriate role for whatever
foreign partner we might have and whatever program we have.

Mr. WU. Thank you.
Dr. Burns.
Dr.  BURNS.  I  will  just  comment  on  a  sideline  of  this  and  that  is
the  fact  that  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  within  the  next  year  we
will  have  three  foreign  spacecraft  in  orbit  around  the  Moon.  We
will have Japan, China and India, and they will provide a very sig-
nificant part of humankind’s understanding of what the Moon is all
about  and  thereby  aid  our  exploration  program  and  I  think  we
need to carry that into other spheres.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  see  that  my  time  has  expired
and I yield to the Ranking Member, the gentleman from California.

LESSONS FROM ASTRONOMY

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  apologize  for  not
being here earlier. I was at another hearing where I am the Rank-
ing  Member  of  that  subcommittee,  as  this  often  happens.  I  am

jumping  from  the  human  rights  report  of  the  State  Department  to
scientific  exploration,  and  that  is  just  the  jumps  we  have  to  make.
First of all, I have been a big supporter of astronomy and in fact,
the  more  I  have  been  involved  with  astronomy,  the  more  I  have
been impressed with what we learn from astronomy is actually im-
portant.  I  always  remind  everybody  that  I  have  this  much  knowl-
edge about that much but I don’t have this much knowledge about
anything, and maybe one of you could tell us, the fundamental im-
portance of having an understanding through astronomy of what is
going  on  out  in  the  universe  because  at  one  point  it  was  like—it
was this great revelation when they told me, well, if you see it out
there  working  out  there,  we  actually  then  could  understand  how
molecules and how the basic building blocks of the universe at our
level  down  at  a  molecular  level  in  our  bodies  and  various  things
here  work.  Maybe  somebody  could  just  give  a  30-second  or  one-
minute explanation of that to me. Does anybody want to jump for-
ward? Don’t we have anybody that——

Dr. BURNS. I am both a Professor of Engineering and a Professor
of  Astronomy  so  let  me  start  as  an  engineer.  As  an  engineer,  you
want to know how planets work, and the way you learn how things
work is, you look at a batch of them. You don’t look at one car, you
want to look at a variety of cars in order to see the different char-
acteristics  and  what  those  characteristics  lead  to,  and  I  think  it  is
essential  in  that  sense  that  we  go  and  explore  various  planets  be-
fore  we  try  to  understand  the  Earth.  And  then  my  astronomy  hat
says  these  are  the  most  profound  questions  that  mankind  faces:
who  are  we,  where  do  we  come  from,  and  we  can  only  understand
that if we see how commonplace the formation of organic molecules
and the possibility of life elsewhere might be.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Are the fundamental principles that we learn
from  astronomy  applicable  to  the  scientific  basis  for  decisions  that
we make here?

Dr.  BURNS.  Physics  is  everywhere.  Chemistry  is  everywhere.  I

mean, it is the same stuff.

if someone would like to——

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  tell  me  about  that  in  layman’s  terms,

Dr.  FISK.  Let  me  try  from  a  slightly  different  tack  here.  Astron-
omy  at  the  moment,  real  astrophysics,  is—and  I  am  a  practitioner
only——

Mr. ROHRABACHER. So astronomy is astrophysics?
Dr.  FISK.  They  are  becoming  completely  synonymous  for  the  fol-
lowing reasons, that is, we are now—as we look out, you know, and
see space and there so—there are very fundamental problems that
have been surfaced, even in the last decade. We only see a few per-
cent  of  the  universe.  We  don’t  know  what  the  other  99  percent  is.
There is evidence of a dark energy, as it is called, which is causing
the  expansion  of  the  universe  in  a  way  that  we  did  not  anticipate.
We  don’t  know  what  it  is.  And  what  that  says  to  you,  I  mean  as
a practitioner—I am not a practitioner. I never venture beyond the
orbit  of  Pluto.  That  is  just—that  is  my  domain  so  I  am  talking
about  things  that  are  beyond  this  point  now.  And  you  say  these
guys are going to find that there is a very basic physics which gov-
erns  everything  that  we  don’t  understand.  We  don’t  know  what  it
is.  And  when  we  do,  the  laws  of  physics  as  we  know  them  will  be

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

88

revised. Now, I can’t think of anything more compelling than to try
and  figure  out  what  the  laws  of  physics  are  because  the  laws  of
physics  concern  everything  that  happens  right  down  to  the
microscale and the molecules and all this stuff, and so you need to
be able to—they are probing the most fundamental questions in the
universe  about  how  does  it  work  and  we  thought  it  worked  the
same  everywhere,  all  scales.  Now  there  is  something  we  see  that
doesn’t  fit;  we  don’t  know  what  it  is.  And  when  we  find  it  out,  the
world will change.

NUCLEAR ENERGY

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Does  this  have  anything  to  do  with  Einstein
and  the  nuclear  bomb?  How  do  the  physics  of  understanding  what
is  going  on  way  out  there  have  anything  to  do  with  our  ability  to
create nuclear energy?

Dr.  FISK.  How  about  if  we  leave  Einstein  in  but  we  leave  the

bomb out?

out.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Okay.  Nuclear  energy  then.  Leave  the  bomb

Dr.  STERN.  If  I  might  chip  in,  I  think  to  answer  your  question,
Mr.  Rohrabacher,  there  are  a  couple  of—if  you  take  the  long  view,
there  is  both  economic  and  a  strategic  importance  to  doing  astron-
omy. You know, the guys that were playing around in physics labs
in  the  middle  of  the  19th  century  with  electricity  had  no  concept
of  what  that  would  yield  for  the  future  of  the  economy,  and  the
same can be true of quantum mechanics in the 1920s and how that
has impacted our view, and more importantly, impacted our ability
to  build  the  electronics  that  we  all  depend  upon  today,  and  the
same way the energy sources that we see in the universe may have
some  application  in  the  future  that  we  can’t  anticipate  and  that  is
the advantage of basic research is that it often yields something far
beyond  your  imagination  which  completely  transforms  the  world,
and  from  a  strategic  standpoint,  I  think  it  is  crucial  that  the
United  States  has  been  the  Nation  that  has  led  in  astronomy,  as-
trophysics and planetary science. As we go forward into the future,
in  future  generations  and  future  centuries,  when  folks  are  taught
science,  school  children  in  whatever  nation  they  are  in,  those  dis-
coveries that opened up the universe and that opened up the solar
system will always be tagged with American space missions, Amer-
ican  facilities,  American  scientists  like  Dr.  Mather,  who  is  here,
and  his  collaborator,  Dr.  Smoot,  who  really  put  the  point  on  what
was only a theory and established the Big Bang with observational
evidence and won the Nobel Prize for it.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Just to note that astronomy is also something
that  we  can—and  which  I  have  tried  to  do  as  a  Member  of  Con-
gress, find ways of getting young people involved in something that
they  can  actually  do.  You  know,  young  people  can  actually  have  a
telescope. Young people can actually go into planetariums and look
into  this.  So  I  had  legislation  in  the  past  that  passed.  That  that
in  itself  is  of  great  value  in  exciting  young  minds,  giving  them
something that is specific they can do. Let me—something else that
I  was  involved  in,  in  terms  of  to  delve  into  this,  was  trying  to  in-
struct NASA to conduct a survey of Near-Earth Objects that might
hit  the  Earth,  and  at  this  point  I  understand  that  there  is  a  tele-

scope  in  Puerto  Rico  that  the  Administration  is  thinking  about
shutting that may indeed be contributing to our ability to find and
catalog  near-Earth  objects.  Is  there  something  move  to  shut  down
this telescope in Puerto Rico and——

ARECIBO RADIO TELESCOPE AND NEAR-EARTH OBJECTS

Dr.  STERN.  I  believe  you  are  speaking  about  the  Arecibo  radio
telescope  that  is  used  for  radar  purposes,  and  the  radar  is  used  to
better  determine  the  orbits  of  some  of  these  near-Earth  objects  so
that  we  get  a  better  bead  on  whether  or  not  they  have  a  potential
for hitting the Earth.

Mr. ROHRABACHER. Is there some plan to shut that down?
Dr.  STERN.  Yes,  but  it  is  actually  a  facility  in  the  budget  that  is
supported  by  the  National  Science  Foundation  that  is  at  risk.  The
NASA  support  for  that  program,  the  grants,  for  example,  that  we
have  in  the  science  mission  directorate,  are  not  affected  and  that
really is an NSF issue.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  So  let  me  note,  in  order  for  us  to  support
basic  science,  quite  often  we  have  to  try  to  show  people  that  there
is  a  direct  relationship,  a  cost-benefit  relationship  to  our  life  and
our safety, let us say, as part of our life, of course, and that to have
a  telescope  that  one  of  the  services  it  provides  is  helping  us  to
track  near-Earth  objects  or  to  catalog  them,  I  think  it  is  a  great
disservice to try to shut something like that down and I would hope
that you keep that priority in mind.

I would like to ask a question about the study—am I out of time?
Can I ask one more question? Would the Chairman indulge me one
more question?

I  understand  that  we  have  determined  that  there  are  warming
trends  going  on  on  Mars  and  other  planets.  Maybe  Dr.  Burns  or
Baker  could  let  me  know.  So  we  have  determined  this,  that  the
other  planets  are  becoming  warmer  or  at  least  Mars  is  becoming
warmer, and how does that fit into calculations that our own plan-
et may be becoming a little warmer?

Dr.  BURNS.  Let  me,  if  you  don’t  mind,  step  back  for  a  moment
because  I  am  quite  intimately  involved  with  the  Arecibo  telescope
and in fact maybe I shouldn’t be speaking because I am sort of bi-
ased.  The  university  that  runs  that  telescope  is  my  university  and
in  fact  sits  under  my  domain,  and  that  is  a  crucial  facility,  as  Dr.
Stern said, for determining the orbits and surface characteristics of
asteroids and thereby helping us avoid the threat, and the problem
that  has  occurred  is  that  the  NSF  budget  has  been  cut  for  the  ob-
servatory and that has necessitated the loss of the radar capability
as  of  this  coming  October,  and  that  facility  originally  received  its
funding from NASA which NASA decided three, five years ago that
they  were  not  willing  to  fund  a  ground-based  facility  and  so  they
shifted  it  over  to  the  NSF.  The  NSF  now  says  hey,  that  is  not  a
problem, we are shifting it back to NASA, and there is a discussion
between the two agencies. From the standpoint of the science com-
munity,  we  think  this  is  a  unique—we  know  it  is  a  unique  world
facility  and  we  don’t  care  who  funds  it  but  it  needs  to  be  funded.
Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  I  think  you  put  us  on  notice  on  that  and  I
think  we  should  make  sure  we  pay  attention  to  that  admonition.

WARMING ON MARS

Dr.  BURNS.  Let  me  move  on  to  your  other  question.  I  mean,  cer-
tainly  there  are  changes  that  are  occurring  on  Mars  in  the  upper
atmosphere  of  Mars,  in  particular  that  suggests  there  is  a  deposi-
tion  of  some  energy  there  but  the  evidence  for  that  is  much  less
than the evidence that we believe we see here on Earth for the in-
creasing local temperatures and so forth and so on. I will let others
address that question actually.

Dr.  BAKER.  I  would  just  comment  that  I  believe  that  one  of  the
great  strengths  of  planetary  science  is  comparison  back  with  the
Earth so what we see in planets in different stages of development
with  different  processes  dominating  helps  us  better  to  understand
our own planet.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Well,  if  Mars  is  indeed  warming  as  I  have
read in several reports, as some of the other planets may be warm-
ing as well, it would indicate to me that the warming trends going
on in the universe have little to do with SUVs and humankind un-
less  of  course  we  are  talking  about  SUVs  and  UFOs  are  the  same
thing,  which  I  doubt.  So  it  would  seem  to  me  that  solar  activity
may  have  a  lot  to  do  with  changes  in  climate  on  the  Earth  and
other places.

With that said, I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

ITAR AND INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT

Mr.  WU.  I  thank  the  gentleman,  and  I  only  have  one  further
question, to return to the ITAR subject. Dr. Burns, you referred to
that  in  your  testimony  and  several  of  the  panelists  referred  to
ITAR and its potential effect on international cooperation in space.
I  want  to  look  at  this  in  a  slightly  different  way.  Are  some  of  you
concerned  that  potentially  overrestrictive  provisions  of  ITAR  have
resulted  in  giving  foreign  governments  an  incentive  to  developing
sensitive  space  and  sensor  and  other  technologies  that  perhaps
they would not have otherwise developed and in fact that they then
proceed to market around the world as ITAR-free technology?

Dr.  FISK.  I  think  the  answer  to  that  is  categorically  yes  and  I
think  there  are  lots  of  studies  on  that  point  that  have  been  con-
ducted by the AIAA and I think perhaps even the Defense Science
Board, and it is a concern whether or not we are in fact protecting
ourselves  or  simply  encouraging.  The  science  perspective  is  prob-
ably—I  mean,  I  wouldn’t  make  this  a  science  issue.  That  is  an
issue of, you know, American space industry and its ability to mar-
ket  its  technologies  around  the  world  and  its  competitors  finding
incentives and reasons for being able not to do that. That is a much
bigger issue than just the science question.

Mr. WU. Any other comments from the panelists?
Dr. BURNS. I would just say it is a very delicate balance that one
has  to  play  when  dealing  with  ITAR  issues.  You  obviously  don’t
want to go overboard and allow access to sensitive technologies. On
the other hand, if you hamper the science and hamper our own ac-
tivities,  that  is  detrimental  to  us  as  well  and  I  worry  too  much
that,  you  know,  we  are  so  worried  about  the  competition  that  we
are weakening ourselves in many of these avenues.

Mr. WU. Dr. Illingworth.

Dr.  ILLINGWORTH.  Thank  you.  Yes,  I  would  like  to  reinforce  that
because I think this does come back to hurt ourselves. Science engi-
neering,  these  areas  benefit  from  dialog  from  competition  in  a
sense  of  ideas  and  actual  techniques  and  so  where  there  is  not
those  opportunities  to  engage  in  those  activities,  we  are  the  ones
that  lose  out  as  much  as  anybody  else  or  maybe  more  so  because
other people have the opportunities for that dialog and that sort of
competitive spirit that we may not be able to carry out.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  understand  that  Mr.  Rohr-

abacher has one quick question.

Mr.  ROHRABACHER.  Very  quick.  Just  for  the  record,  I  have  no
trouble with cooperation between scientists from free countries and
from  other  democratic  countries.  I  think  that  we  have  to  be  very
cautious in training scientists who will then return to dictatorships
that  may  be  opposed  to  our  way  of  life  and  may  actually  create  a
threat  to  Western  civilization.  I  mean,  whether  or  not  is  a  bomb
in Pakistan, I would hate to think that we had Pakistani scientists
here  and  trained  them  how  to  make  that  bomb.  I  would  hate  to
think that democratic countries like our own would use our science
and  so  indiscriminately  provide  information  that  we  provide  the
means  for  a  dictatorship  like  China  to  set  up  a  computer  system
that will spy on its own people and put believers in God in jail and
be able to control the Internet in their societies when they couldn’t
have done it without our help, things such as that. So I just would
like to make sure that we balance off the pure science isn’t an end
in  and  of  itself.  If  it  works  with  people  who  are  tyrants  and  nega-
tive  forces  on  this  world,  that  science  is  not  a  good  thing  to  trans-
mit to those people.

So  with  that  said,  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  am  sorry

I was a little late but I am running back and forth.

Mr. WU. I thank the gentleman, and I think we all have this con-
cern  about  appropriate  development  of  technology  and  national  se-
curity.

Before we bring the hearing to a close, I want to thank all of our
witnesses for testifying before the Subcommittee today. The record
will  remain  open  for  additional  statements  from  Members  and  for
answers  to  any  follow-up  questions  the  Subcommittee  may  ask  of
witnesses.  I  also  ask  unanimous  consent  to  insert  into  the  record
additional  and  extraneous  material.  Without  objection,  so  ordered.
The hearing is now adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 12:58 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  S.  Alan  Stern,  Associate  Administrator,  NASA  Science  Mission  Direc-

torate

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. Your  testimony  refers  to  new  standards  for  the  selection  of  Principal  Investiga-
tors on space missions. Could you please elaborate on those standards and how
they will help to manage mission costs?

A1. NASA  is  instituting  minimum  Principal  Investigator  (PI)  space  flight  experi-
ence  standards  for  the  2007  Small  Explorer  (SMEX)  Announcement  of  Opportunity
and  all  future  PI  mission  selections  in  order  to  reduce  the  inherent  risk  in  PI-led
missions with PIs who have never played a significant role in a space flight mission
or  instrument  development.  This  risk  jeopardizes  PI-led  mission  cost  and  schedule
attainability,  and  can  affect  mission  technical  risk  level.  Cost,  schedule,  and  tech-
nical  problems  in  turn  adversely  affect  the  frequency  of  future  missions  NASA  can
mount, and jeopardize the viability of PI-led missions. The PI experience standards
we are implementing are designed to significantly mitigate these issues to the ben-
efit  of  NASA  and  the  science  community  as  a  whole.  Other  senior  mission  science
team  personnel  such  as  mission  Deputy  PI,  Project  Scientist  (PS),  Chief  Scientist,
Science  Team  Lead,  and  instrument  PIs  that  may  be  involved  in  PI-led  missions
need  not  meet  the  same  space  flight  experience  standards  as  the  mission  leader—
the  PI—though  their  experience  level  will  remain  a  factor  in  Technical,  Manage-
ment, and Cost evaluations.

There  are  three  parts  to  the  minimum  space  flight  experience  standards  for  a
SMEX  and  all  future  PI  mission  selections—the  PI  will  need  senior  project  experi-
ence on a project that went into space. More specifically:

(a) A  PI  will  need  to  have  served  previously  as  the  PI,  the  Deputy  PI,  the  PS,

or the Deputy PS on a qualifying space project.

(b) A qualifying space project can be a full mission, an instrument, or an exper-

iment.

(c) The  qualifying  project  must  have  been  a  space  project  that  has  been
launched. A space project is one that goes into the space or near-space envi-
ronment.  Space  projects  include  sub-orbital  projects  (sounding  rockets,  sci-
entific  balloons),  orbital  projects,  and  deep  space  projects.  Within  these
standards, a large number of U.S. space scientists qualify.

Q2. In  your  testimony,  you  state  that  ‘‘by  looking  for  ways  to  increase  efficiency
within our organization, and within the way we manage missions, we can make
new  funding  available  within  the  President’s  budget  that  will  enable  us  to  do
significantly  more.’’  What  fraction  of  the  space  science  budget  (or,  alternatively
how much money) do you realistically think you will be able to free up through
those efficiencies? What’s the basis of that estimate?

A2. Over  the  three  year  period  from  February  2004  (FY  2005  budget  request)  to
February  2007  (FY  2008  budget  request),  28  Science  Mission  Directorate  (SMD)
flight missions required budget increases totaling $4 billion in estimated Life Cycle
Costs  (LCC).  This  is  a  major  source  of  inefficiency  corresponding  to  approximately
75  percent  of  one  year’s  budget  for  SMD.  NASA  needs  to  avoid  such  LCC  growth
in  the  future  via  stronger  program  management  practices.  While  we  cannot  specify
the  exact  amount  of  future  mission  LCC  growth  we  will  avoid,  we  expect  signifi-
cantly  better  performance  than  in  the  last  three  years.  We  also  plan  to  institute
smaller  dollar  (but  important)  efficiency  gains  in  the  management  of  grant  paper-
work.
Q3. Immature  technologies  have  been  identified  as  a  key  contributor  to  mission  cost
growth in the past. However, the FY 2008 budget request reduces the opportuni-
ties  for  technology  development  through  the  New  Millennium  and  research  and
analysis programs.

Q3a. Why is NASA reducing the New Millennium and R&A technology development

activities?

A3a. The  decision  to  reduce  funding  for  the  New  Millennium  program  was  nec-
essary in order to make funding available to achieve a balanced, executable portfolio
within  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  (SMD)  and  to  concentrate  more  heavily  on
SMD’s  main  mission:  producing  scientific  results  that  advance  the  priorities  of  the
four  National  Research  Council  (NRC)  Decadal  Surveys  (Earth  science,  Astro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00098 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

95

physics,  Heliophysics,  and  Planetary  science).  Specifically,  funding  was  eliminated
for the Space Technology (ST)–9 mission since that early (competitive Phase A) for-
mulation  and  had  only  reached  the  Concept  Study  Report  stage.  Furthermore,  its
priority  as  a  technology  flight  demonstration  was  lower  than  the  current  science
missions vying for funding in this time period.

With regard to funding for the Research and Analysis (R&A) program, total fund-
ing  in  the  FY  2008  budget  request  for  technology-based  R&A  activities  represents
a slight increase over the funding available in FY 2007. The R&A program includes
a  number  of  instrument  incubator  and  technology  development  elements  designed
to enable future science missions in each of SMD’s four portfolio areas. In addition,
SMD  is  looking  for  ways  to  increase  opportunities,  such  as  through  the  addition  of
four  new  investigations  to  the  Astrophysics  and  Heliophysics  sounding  rockets  pro-
grams,  which  not  only  provide  training  for  investigators,  but  also  help  develop  the
next generation detectors required for future science missions.
Q3b. How  important  do  you  think  it  is  to  maintain  a  long-term  technology  develop-
ment activity in NASA’s space science program? What fraction of overall fund-
ing should that technology development activity represent?

A3b. It  is  very  important  to  maintain  a  long-term  technology  development  activity
in  NASA’s  space  science  program.  The  funding  reductions  for  long-term  technology
development  in  FY  2008  reflect  the  relative  priority  and  are  temporary  as  NASA
works  off  the  backlog  of  missions  already  in  formulation  and  readjusts  the  phasing
of its future mission plans. In the future, technology efforts will be more closely tied
to  specific  mission  needs,  as  has  recently  been  successfully  demonstrated  by  James
Web Space Telescope. There is not an optimal single overall fraction of funding that
should be allocated for technology development. This decision must be made for each
science  discipline  within  the  context  of  the  community-based  priorities  and  mission
plans. In some cases, the reapplication of technologies that are already in hand can
go  a  long  way  towards  meeting  the  science  priorities  identified  in  the  National  Re-
search Council (NRC)’s decadal surveys. In other cases, significant technology devel-
opment  will  be  required  in  order  to  achieve  these  priorities.  Each  science  division
within  NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  will  work  with  their  communities,  in-
cluding  the  NRC  and  the  subcommittees  of  the  NASA  Advisory  Council,  to  identify
critical technology needs for specific missions and their relative priorities in the con-
text of the overall science program.
Q4. The science community has commented on the absence of mechanisms by which
the  community  can  have  input  into  NASA’s  space  science  program  through  its
internal advisory process. A recent National Academies report recommended that
‘‘NASA  should  consider  changes  in  its  advisory  structure  to  shorten  the  path
between  advisory  groups  and  relevant  managers  so  as  to  maximize  the  rel-
evance,  utility,  and  timeliness  of  advice  as  well  as  the  quality  of  the  dialogue
with  advice  givers.’’  In  specific  terms,  how  do  you  plan  to  work  with  the  space
science community and with internal and external advisory committees?

A4. NASA  restructured  the  NASA  Advisory  Council  and  its  Committees  and  Sub-
committees  in  November  2005  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  Administrator  receives
advice  that  is  fully  integrated  across  the  science,  engineering,  and  business  dis-
ciplines  involved.  Over  the  last  year  and  a  half,  the  communications  links  between
the  NAC  and  its  subcommittees  and  relevant  NASA  managers  remain  intact.  Each
of  the  science  subcommittees  of  the  NAC  holds  open  meetings,  which  NASA  man-
gers regularly attend and are often asked to make presentations. Further, each sub-
committee  generates  a  report  for  each  meeting  that,  while  addressed  to  the  Chair
of  the  NAC  Science  Committee,  is  copied  to  the  relevant  NASA  science  division  di-
rector.  Externally,  NASA  maintains  its  long-standing  relationship  with  the  Boards
and Committees of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences, as
well  as  the  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Advisory  Committee  (AAAC).  Members  of
NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  (SMD)  senior  management  team  are  regular
participants  at  NRC  Space  Studies  Board  meetings,  and  at  any  given  time,  the
Board  has  several  studies  underway  to  provide  advice  requested  by  the  Agency  on
science  community  priorities.  The  next  round  of  space  science  decadal  surveys  will
begin formulation next year.

In  addition  to  these  formal  channels  by  which  the  community  can  provide  input
to  NASA’s  SMD,  the  new  SMD  Senior  Management  team  has  begun  a  series  of  ac-
tive townhall meetings with members of the science community as a way to receive
informal  feedback.  These  town  halls  occur  across  the  country,  with  participants  at
science  conferences  and  scientists  at  universities,  research  laboratories,  and  NASA
centers.  Through  early  June  2007,  meetings  have  taken  place  in  California,  Mary-

96

land,  Hawaii  and  Arizona.  SMD  has  also  established  an  e-mail  address  to  receive
questions, concerns, and suggestions from members of the science community.
Q5. The Science Plan for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate 2007–2016, notes that
an  important  question  is  ‘‘whether  the  science  activities  enabled  by  the  human
exploration  program  and  identified  as  compelling  by  the  science  community
have  greater  or  lesser  priority  than  activities  previously  planned  by  [NASA’s
Science  Mission  Directorate].’’  How  do  you  plan  to  address  this  question  of  pri-
orities?

A5. NASA will address the question of priorities of science that derives from human
exploration  activities  and  capabilities  using  the  results  of  the  upcoming  National
Research  Council  (NRC)  report  on  lunar  science  priorities,  ‘‘The  Scientific  Context
for Exploration of the Moon.’’ In addition, NASA will ask the next round of Decadal
Surveys,  beginning  with  the  2008  kickoff  of  the  2010  Astrophysics  Decadal  Survey,
to incorporate human exploration-enabled science in their deliberations.
Q6. You have informed the subcommittee that you will move NASA’s Near-Earth Ob-
ject  program,  along  with  its  associated  funding,  from  the  Exploration  Systems
Mission  Directorate  to  the  Science  Mission  Directorate.  Could  you  please  elabo-
rate on your plans for the Near Earth Object program?

A6. The Near-Earth Object Observation (NEOO) program is being transferred back
to NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD), along with its budget, effective in FY
2008. The Program will be housed in the Earth Science Division (ESD) as ESD stud-
ies hazards to the Earth, and NEOs are one such hazard, much like the ozone hole
and  global  warming.  While  there  are  currently  no  plans  to  alter  the  budget  for  the
NEOO  program,  NASA  does  plan  to  continue  NEOO  efforts  after  2008  when  the
current  survey  down  to  one-kilometer  sizes  is  completed.  That  new  work  will  con-
centrate  on  reducing  orbit  uncertainties  in  catalogued  NEOs,  finding  the  few  (10
percent)  undiscovered  NEOs  with  one  km  or  larger  sizes,  and  locating  new  but
somewhat smaller NEOs. In addition, NASA’s Planetary Astronomy grants program
supports  NEO  observations  that  reveal  new  physical  insights  into  their  nature  and
our Discovery mission program is evaluating a finalist proposal to visit and sample
an NEO.
Q7. Dr.  Stern,  given  the  constraints  on  growth  in  NASA’s  space  science  programs,
how do you plan to help ensure the lunar science program is sustainable? Where
will the money for it come from?

A7. NASA’s  FY  2008  budget  request  includes  $351  million  over  five  years  for  a
lunar science research project. This project, part of the Science Mission Directorate’s
Planetary  Science  Division,  is  being  designed  to  provide  for  the  activities  outlined
below:

1) Ingest and archive of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and Lunar Crater
Observation  and  Sensing  Satellite  (LCROSS)  data  into  the  Planetary  Data
System;

2) competed  opportunities  for  scientific  payloads  to  fly  on  both  international

missions;

3) competed opportunities to analyze scientific data from lunar missions and ac-

companying scientific payloads;

4) competed  opportunities  to  develop  technology  and  instruments  to  support

lunar science studies; and,

5) competed basic lunar science investigation.

Additionally,  in  2010,  SMD  will  take  over  the  LRO  mission  from  ESMD  for  an
extended mission of lunar science observations. Funding to create the lunar science
project  came  from  the  reprogramming  of  funds  from  lower  priority  activities  within
the  Planetary  Science  Division.  SMD  is  also  encouraging  the  use  of  its  existing  or-
bital assets like the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra for observing the surface
of the Earth’s moon.
Q8. In  your  testimony,  you  talk  about  being  an  enthusiastic  advocate  of  human  ex-
ploration.  You  then  go  on  to  state  that  one  of  your  three  guiding  principles  for
the Science Mission Directorate is ‘‘to help the Vision for Space Exploration suc-
ceed.’’  In  specific  terms,  what  changes  do  you  plan  to  make  to  the  goals,  prior-
ities,  and  plans  of  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  to  help  the  Vision  for  Space
Exploration succeed?

A8. NASA’s  Science  Mission  Directorate  will  support  human  exploration  efforts  by
funding  a  developing  lunar  science  community.  This  effort  is  included  in  the  Presi-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00100 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

97

dent’s FY 2008 budget request as a new line item in the Planetary Science Division
of  SMD,  with  a  total  funding  of  $351  million  over  five  years.  That  funding  will  be
used  to  analyze  lunar  data  from  the  Lunar  Reconnaissance  Orbiter  (LRO)  and
Lunar  CRater  Observation  and  Sensing  Satellite  (LCROSS)  missions,  to  institute  a
lunar R&A program, to fund a science-driven mission extension of LRO in FY 2010,
and to fund new instruments to fly on future foreign lunar missions.
Q9. NASA has imposed cost ‘‘caps’’ on a number of its small- and medium-sized mis-
sion  programs,  such  as  Discovery.  With  the  advent  of  full-cost  accounting,  are
those cost caps still realistic or should they be adjusted? Have the cost caps prov-
en to be an effective tool?

A9. While  full  cost  charges  have  varied  over  time  as  full  cost  accounting  has  been
implemented  at  NASA,  the  cost  cap  in  each  Announcement  of  Opportunity  has
taken  this  factor  into  account.  These  cost  caps  have  increased  in  recent  years  for
the purpose of compensating full cost accounting-driven increases in the cost of work
done at NASA centers. Additionally, NASA has consistently instructed that all pro-
posed mission costs include full cost accounting.

Cost  caps  serve  an  effective  role  in  guiding  management  decisions  both  within
projects and at NASA Headquarters, and we plan to continue using cost caps on PI-
led and other missions for this purpose. Some of the benefits of using cost caps are
outlined below.

• Cost caps help bound the complexity of possible missions, thus simplifying the
evaluation  and  selection  process  by  ensuring  there  is  no  bias  towards  those
missions with the most complexity.

• Cost  caps  enable  long-range  program  planning  for  future  solicitations  since

the maximum cost of each mission is known.

• Cost  caps  provide  clear  and  strategic  limits  on  how  much  mission  implemen-

tation costs can grow after selection without termination.

Questions submitted by Representative Ken Calvert
Q1. Statements  made  by  other  witnesses  indicate  a  strong  preference  for  flying  fre-
quent small- and medium-sized competed missions, with a flagship mission once
every decade. What would you consider to be a healthy tempo for competed, Prin-
cipal Investigator-led missions?

A1. At  our  current  budget  level,  the  optimum  rate  for  Principal  Investigator  (PI)-
led missions is approximately one to two per year in each of our science disciplines:
astrophysics, Earth science, planetary science, and heliophysics. The Agency is tak-
ing  steps  to  move  towards  this  level  within  our  available  resources.  For  example,
NASA  will  select  three  Small  Explorer  (SMEX)  missions,  instead  of  one  Medium-
Class  Explorer  (MIDEX)  mission,  in  the  next  Explorer  Announcement  of  Oppor-
tunity  (AO),  to  be  released  this  October.  NASA  also  will  release  an  Earth  science
PI-led mission AO in the 2008–2009 timeframe. Finally, NASA will increase the rate
of  sub-orbital  PI-led  missions,  as  evidenced  by  our  recent  selection  of  four  new  PI-
led missions in the astrophysics and heliophysics sounding rocket programs. Within
the next few months, NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) will select new PI-
led missions from the Discovery Program and from the Mars Scout Program. In ad-
dition, SMD plans to call for a number of different types of PI-led proposals in 2009.
Q2. With respect to future deep space missions, what is the availability of RTGs (or
other forms of nuclear power sources) to power spacecraft? How many would be
available over the next decade?

A2. At the present time, the first Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Gener-
ator (MMRTG) is being qualified for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover mis-
sion,  which  is  planned  for  launch  in  September  2009.  Following  qualification  of
MMRTG  for  MSL,  one  flight  unit  and  a  spare  are  planned  to  be  ready  in  time  for
the  scheduled  launch  opportunity.  It  is  anticipated  that  use  of  MMRTG  for  a  large
mission  to  an  outer  planet  destination  such  as  Jupiter  would  require  fabrication  of
six to seven more MMRTGs, assuming spacecraft power requirements do not exceed
about 1 kilowatt at the beginning of the mission, and preferably no more than about
800 watts. NASA would work with the U.S. Department of Energy to determine re-
source needs and the schedule to meet potential launch dates.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Lennard  A.  Fisk,  Chair,  Space  Studies  Board,  National  Research

Council

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. NASA has imposed cost ‘‘caps’’ on a number of its small- and medium-sized mis-
sion  programs,  such  as  Discovery.  With  the  advent  of  full-cost  accounting,  are
those cost caps still realistic or should they be adjusted? Have the cost caps prov-
en to be an effective tool?

A1. There have been two principal drivers that have required increases in cost caps:
launch vehicle costs, and full-cost accounting, the primary impact of which has been
increased management costs of missions. NASA needs to continuously assess the re-
alism of the cost caps, to ensure that quality missions can be proposed and executed.
The  realism  of  the  assigned  cost  caps  can  be  validated  by  the  proposals  submitted.
So  long  as  the  science  community  can  propose  and  subsequently  execute  exciting
missions  within  the  assigned  caps,  the  cap  is  realistic.  As  a  management  tool,  the
caps  have  been  highly  effective.  Missions  with  caps  have  far  fewer,  and  less-severe
cost  overruns  than  do  the  larger  missions,  which  are  generally  not  initiated  with
a cap in place.
Q2. The  National  Academies  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  rec-
ommends  ‘‘emphasis  on  physical  sciences,  engineering,  mathematics  and  infor-
mation  sciences,’’  as  well  as  high-risk  research,  grants  to  early  career  research-
ers,  and  funding  for  advanced  research  instrumentation  and  facilities,  among
other  actions,  that  can  help  foster  innovation  and  sustain  a  strong  economy.
How relevant are NASA’s space science research programs to those recommenda-
tions? Can you offer any specific examples? NASA’s science program was not in-
cluded  in  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI).  Would  you
advocate  NASA’s  science  programs  be  made  part  of  the  ACI  in  future  budgets?
If not, why not?

A2. There are three areas in which NASA science could participate in the ACI: edu-
cation, direct impact on the economy, and fundamental knowledge:

Education:  Currently  and  historically,  NASA’s  most  important  contributions  to
education  have  come  from  the  Science  Mission  Directorate  (SMD),  and,  when  it  ex-
isted,  the  program  in  physical  and  biological  sciences  in  microgravity.  Hands-on
projects  have  been  provided  for  undergraduates  and  graduate  students,  fellowships
have  been  available,  and  most  R&A  grants  to  universities  provide  support  for  stu-
dents. Students are trained by participating in projects of varying complexity, rang-
ing  from  sounding  rockets  and  balloons,  to  actual  space  instrumentation  that  is
being built in university labs.

In recent years, NASA has cut back dramatically on its support for university re-
search  labs,  particularly  those  doing  space  hardware.  This  is  the  result  of  reduced
flight  opportunities  of  small  and  moderate  missions,  and  a  retrenchment  into  the
NASA centers. The consequence has been fewer and fewer opportunities to train un-
dergraduate  and  graduate  students  in  the  construction  of  actual  space  hardware.
The historical role that NASA has had to provide the Nation with a technically com-
petent workforce has been greatly abated.

A useful role for NASA in the ACI would follow from an initiative to enhance the
participation of the Nation’s research universities in the development of space hard-
ware, thereby, as a direct consequence, providing hands-on experience for students.
It is important to note that these are not to be watered-down projects, such as stu-
dent  satellites.  There  is  no  reason  why  university  researchers  and  their  students
cannot develop the most sophisticated instruments needed for forefront research.

Direct  Impact  on  the  Economy.  There  are  certain  NASA  science  disciplines  that
have  direct  impact  on  the  American  economy.  Foremost  is  Earth  science,  and  to  a
lesser degree, heliophysics [the influence of the Sun on the climate and space weath-
er].  Knowing  what  is  the  immediate  future  of  the  climate  is  essential  to  a  variety
of  industries,  from  agriculture  to  insurance,  to  the  auto  industry,  to  coastal  infra-
structure, etc.

The current funding for Earth science is not adequate to provide the required in-
formation  on  the  future  of  the  climate.  There  are  also  deficiencies  in  the  funding
for  heliophysics,  particularly  if  space  weather,  and  its  influence  on  space  or  ground
assets, is considered important.

Fundamental  Knowledge.  All  of  the  science  disciplines  in  NASA—astrophysics,
planetary,  Earth  science,  heliophysics,  life  and  physical  sciences  in  microgravity—

provide  fundamental  knowledge.  Since  this  is  a  thrust  of  ACI,  with  the  inclusion
of  the  NSF  and  the  DOE  Office  of  Science,  each  of  the  NASA  science  disciplines
could be an active participant in ACI.
Q3. A recently released study of the National Academy of Sciences on Building a Bet-
ter  NASA  Workforce  recommended  that:  ‘‘. . .NASA  increase  its  investment  in
proven programs such as sounding rocket launches, aircraft-based research, and
high-altitude  balloon  campaigns,  which  provide  ample  opportunities  for  hands-
on flight development experience at a relatively low cost of failure.’’

Q3a. Could  you  please  explain  in  concrete  terms  how  the  sub-orbital  programs  are

used to train students and young workers?

A3a. There  is  a  very  powerful  statement  that  can  be  made  about  the  sub-orbital
program: Essentially every major experimentalist currently executing NASA’s space
and  Earth  science  program  learned  his/her  skills  in  the  sub-orbital  program.  The
projects are of limited duration, and thus can be executed during the time required
for  a  graduate  thesis.  They  involve  the  essential  skills  of  system  management  and
data analysis, as well as challenging engineering.

The sub-orbital program has been reduced systematically over the years, to where
it is now a shadow of its former robustness. With the arrival of Alan Stern as Asso-
ciate  Administrator,  there  has  been  some  welcome  revitalization  to  the  sub-orbital
program, but it is still inadequate to meet the needs of training the next generation
of experimentalists.
Q3b. What  do  these  sub-orbital  programs  typically  cost  and  do  they  produce  peer-

reviewed research?

A3b. There  are  certain  science  disciplines  that  can  use  the  sub-orbital  program  ef-
fectively.  Sounding  rockets  can  study  plasma  phenomena  such  as  the  aurora  di-
rectly,  and  sounding  rockets  and  particularly  balloons  can  be  used  for  forefront  as-
tronomical  observations.  There  are  also  aircraft  that  can  be  used  as  appropriate
platforms  for  astronomical  and  Earth  science  observations.  It  would  be  helpful  in
Earth  science,  if  there  were  a  more  robust  program  in  Unpiloted  Airborne  Vehicles
(UAVs).  Other  disciplines,  such  as  the  study  of  the  heliosphere,  where  it  is  nec-
essary  for  a  spacecraft  to  make  in-situ  observations,  cannot  profit  from  the  sub-or-
bital  program  for  science;  however,  instrumentation  that  will  ultimately  fly  on  a
spacecraft can be tested.
Q4. NASA’s  Research  &  Analysis  (R&A)  programs  are  mentioned  as  being  critical
for  developing  new  mission  concepts  and  advanced  technology.  What  impacts
will the cutbacks in R&A have on the opportunities for future missions and pro-
grams?  If  R&A  remains  at  current  levels,  what  are  we  likely  to  see,  or  not  see,
in the next five years?

A4. Science is an evolutionary process. We make observations, and then we develop
theories  and  models  to  explain  the  observations.  The  theories  and  models  then  de-
mand  new  observations  as  tests.  Similarly,  we  build  our  missions  on  existing  tech-
nology,  but  in  the  process  recognize  the  opportunities  that  new  technology  can  pro-
vide  us.  The  availability  of  the  new  technology,  plus  the  demand,  results  in  new
missions.  The  R&A  program,  with  its  support  of  theory  and  modeling,  and  tech-
nology  development,  is  the  lynchpin  in  this  evolutionary  process.  The  program  sits
at the nexus between what we have done and what we want to do.

Historically in NASA science, when the flight rate was low, the R&A program was
enhanced, to increase the demand and the opportunities for new missions. The flight
rate and funding for R&A have thus been anti-correlated. The odd part of the recent
cuts in R&A is that they occurred when the flight rate is in decline. It thus follows,
that  at  the  current  reduced  funding  level,  the  R&A  cannot  readily  serve  its  histor-
ical role in the evolutionary process of advancing space and Earth science.
Q5. What is the current frequency of Explorer and Discovery missions, and what do
you believe should be the frequency of launch opportunities if we want to sustain
a healthy space science research program in each of the disciplines?

A5. The  Explorer  program,  which  supports  the  astrophysics  and  heliophysics  pro-
gram,  is  NASA’s  oldest  flight  program.  Over  the  49-year  history  of  the  space  pro-
gram,  there  have  been  more  than  100  Explorers,  or  an  average  of  more  than  two
per  year.  The  flight  rate  today  is  a  small  fraction  of  this  rate,  as  a  consequence  of
more than $1 billion having been removed from the runout of the Explorer line. The
Discovery program has fared somewhat better, being better able to maintain its his-
toric  flight  rate  of  about  one  every  other  year.  Other  moderate  missions,  such  as
the Solar Terrestrial Probes (STP), have greatly reduced flight rates, since the first

100

mission in this line has been allowed to grow substantially in cost. In Earth science,
the Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP) missions are effectively at a stand still,
and,  so  far,  it  has  not  been  possible  to  initiate  the  new  missions  called  for  in  the
recent  decadal  survey  for  Earth  science.  As  a  consequence  of  all  these  reductions
and  delays,  the  flight  rate  for  small  and  moderate  missions  is  greatly  reduced.  The
total  fight  rate  for  all  NASA  science  missions  will  be  under  two  per  year  in  2010–
2012,  compared  to  an  historical  rate  in  the  1990s  of  an  average  of  seven  per  year.
Clearly,  it  is  necessary  to  restore  the  flight  rate  of  small  and  moderate  missions.
These  missions  not  only  perform  excellent  science,  but  they  are  an  essential  part
of  the  continuum  that  is  essential  for  the  development  of  human  capital  and  tech-
nology;  it  begins  with  R&A  and  extends  through  small  and  moderate  missions,  to
NASA’s most challenging flight programs. A reasonable goal would be to return the
overall  flight  rate  of  science  missions  to  above  seven  per  year,  balanced  across  the
disciplines. Since there is no room in the budget for additional large programs, this
can  be  accomplished  only  by  additional  small  and  moderate  missions.  In  addition,
a  major  Earth  science  initiative  to  implement  the  recommendations  of  the  decadal
survey should be allowed to increase the flight rate even further.
Q6. In your view, what role does the structure of the advisory system play in ensur-

ing the strength of the space science programs?

A6. Early  in  the  history  of  the  space  program,  a  very  effective  advisory  structure
for  science  developed.  The  National  Academies’  National  Research  Council,  pri-
marily through the Space Studies Board, provided strategic advice, and the internal
NASA  advisory  committees,  particularly  those  that  advise  the  Science  Mission  Di-
rectorate  and  its  predecessor  offices,  provided  the  tactical  advice  for  implementing
the strategies. This advisory system, which was practiced for 40 years, has ensured
the  quality  of  NASA  science.  Recently,  NASA  has  effectively  abolished  the  internal
NASA advisory structure, particularly the advice that was given directly to the As-
sociate  Administrator  for  the  Science  Mission  Directorate.  This  is  an  unfortunate
loss,  and  removes  from  the  Associate  Administrator  an  effective  means  to  formally
interact  with  the  science  community.  It  is  possible  to  work  around  this  deficiency,
and  there  is  an  expectation  that  the  current  Associate  Administrator,  Alan  Stern,
will.  Nonetheless,  in  the  next  NASA  administration,  the  decision  to  abolish  the  in-
ternal advisory structure for science should be reversed.

Questions submitted by Representative Ken Calvert
Q1. What metric should NASA use to establish an appropriate level of technology de-
velopment  investment  across  the  programs?  Should  it  be  a  percentage  of  the
overall program funding, or should it be a fixed amount?

A1. This  question  does  not  have  a  simple  answer.  The  technology  investment  re-
quired,  as  well  as  R&A  funding  in  general,  will  vary  from  discipline  to  discipline.
It  will  depend  on  the  current  state  of  technology  development  for  the  discipline;  is
it  adequate  to  support  future  missions  or  are  major  breakthroughs  required  to  ad-
vance  the  science?  For  example,  as  noted  above,  there  is  a  logic  in  making  more
R&A investments when the flight rate is low, to yield a greater flight rate, and thus
funding R&A should not be a simple percentage of the existing program.

This is an area that is worthy of a detailed study to set up appropriate strategies
for  R&A  funding  for  each  science  discipline.  R&A  funding  is  perceived  to  be  inad-
equate, particularly with the recent cuts, and it is important to have a detailed de-
fendable  strategy  to  justify  the  restoration  of  funds  and  any  future  funding  level.
Q2. What  mission  assurance  and  management  requirements  imposed  by  NASA  do
you  believe  are  counter-productive  or  impose  costs  that  are  disproportionate  to
the size of the mission, or that offer little added value?

A2. Over the decades, the United States has developed great capabilities to execute
space and Earth science missions. The expertise resides in university labs, in indus-
try,  as  well  as  in  the  NASA  centers.  In  the  best  of  worlds,  the  organizations  with
expertise  and  experience  are  allowed  to  perform  their  tasks  in  the  most  cost-effec-
tive manner possible, with the aim that they achieve mission success. Many of these
projects  are  managed  out  of  NASA  centers.  With  full-cost  accounting,  and  the  need
to justify the civil service workforce, the number of individuals participating in this
management has grown substantially. It is not obvious to experienced scientists and
engineers  that  this  additional  management  oversight,  which  carries  a  cost  for  both
the NASA center and the contractor, adds value and reduces risk. Rather, it is more
likely that risk is increased since the oversight, if extreme, can reduce the attention
paid to good engineering practices. For larger, more complicated missions, highly so-

101

phisticated  management  oversight  is  required.  However,  the  distracting  practices
are  particularly  onerous  for  small  and  moderate  missions,  and  of  no  clear  benefit.
Q3. How should NASA and the space science disciplines best develop estimated mis-
sion  costs,  at  a  reasonable  level  of  confidence,  during  the  next  round  of  decadal
surveys?  Who  should  perform  these  estimates?  What  level  of  confidence  do  you
believe is appropriate?

A3. In  the  current  Beyond  Einstein  Program  Assessment  Committee  (BEPAC),  the
NRC  has  engaged  a  subcontractor  specializing  in  cost  estimating  to  perform  inde-
pendent  cost  estimates  for  the  missions  under  consideration.  If  this  arrangement
proves  satisfactory,  it  will  be  an  appropriate  model  to  follow  for  the  next  round  of
decadals  and  other  NRC  priority  setting  studies.  The  cost  of  such  studies  to  the
sponsor(s) will increase commensurately, but the final product would be more valu-
able  in  that  priorities  would  be  set  with  greater  clarity  about  project  costs,  and  as-
surance  that  the  cost  estimate  was  developed  independently  of  the  project,  as  well
as the Agency overall. The NRC does not take a position on what level of confidence
should  be  used  for  such  cost  estimates,  and  will  rely  on  the  sponsor  to  specify  the
level  of  confidence  required.  NASA’s  current  policy  for  missions  in  the  Science  Mis-
sion  Directorate  is  70  percent,  and  that  is  the  confidence  level  being  used  for
BEPAC.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Garth  D.  Illingworth,  Chair,  Astronomy  and  Astrophysics  Advisory

Committee (AAAC)

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. NASA has imposed cost ‘‘caps’’ on a number of its small- and medium-sized mis-
sion  programs,  such  as  Discovery.  With  the  advent  of  full-cost  accounting,  are
these cost caps still realistic or should they be adjusted? Have the cost caps prov-
en to be an effective tool?

A1. With  the  advent  of  full-cost  accounting,  are  these  cost  caps  still  realistic  or
should they be adjusted? There has been a growing sense that the previous cost-caps
were too small for Explorers and Discovery missions. It has become increasingly dif-
ficult  to  undertake  cutting-edge  science  programs  within  the  cost-caps.  Several
changes  have  contributed  to  this,  in  addition  to  the  impact  of  full-cost  accounting.
NASA  advocated  an  increase  in  contingency  to  30  percent  for  these  programs  sev-
eral years ago, given the concerns with continuing overruns in the cost-capped mis-
sions. The Space Science Advisory Committee (SScAC) supported increasing the con-
tingency  to  try  and  minimize  overruns,  even  though  it  appeared  to  limit  what  the
proposing  team  could  do  within  the  cost-cap.  A  further  problem  is  the  increasing
cost of launch vehicles for Explorer and Discovery missions, especially with the dis-
continuation of the Delta launch vehicles. There is another factor also which reflects
the  increasing  maturity  of  the  scientific  studies  in  the  Planetary  and  Astrophysics
programs. The ‘‘low-hanging fruit’’ has been picked, i.e., the easiest studies have, in
many cases, been done already. This results in future missions needing more sophis-
ticated detection systems and/or larger optics, both of which tend to drive costs high-
er.  While  increases  in  cost  caps  will  trade  against  mission  frequency,  unless  the
budgetary  situation  improves  significantly,  it  is  my  sense  that  many  prospective
projects  that  have  high  scientific  value  are  potentially  excluded  with  the  ‘‘tradi-
tional’’  level  of  cost  caps  and  so  some  reduction  in  frequency  for  higher  cost-caps
might be an appropriate trade-off.

The cost-cap for the last Discovery mission proposals proved to be extremely chal-
lenging  for  the  Astrophysics  missions  that  were  proposed  for  planet  searches.  In-
creases  are  needed,  at  least  to  accommodate  planet  search  options.  The  next  Ex-
plorer  call  for  proposals  will  need  a  much  larger  cost-cap  than  that  used  in  2002
to offset the effect of full-cost accounting, appropriate levels of contingency, and the
uncertainty  and  likely  higher  cost  associated  with  the  launch  vehicle.  The  cost-cap
associated  with  the  Astrophysics  Probes,  now  being  discussed  as  an  analog  to  the
Planetary Division’s New Frontiers program, will need careful consideration as well,
since  all  the  same  elements  (full-cost  accounting;  contingency;  launch  vehicles)  will
challenge those $0.6+B scale missions as well.

Have  the  cost  caps  proven  to  be  an  effective  tool?  It  is  my  view  that  cost  caps  are
an  effective  tool.  They  are  no  guarantee  that  missions  will  come  in  on  budget,  but
the caps provide a number of advantages. First, they provide great pressure on the
proposing team and the NASA center to rigorously assess the likely cost of the mis-
sion before and during the proposal process. The cost caps also provide similar pres-
sure  during  the  Phase  A  process  after  preliminary  selection  and  before  final  selec-
tion. Second, they provide some very specific budget points at which the agency and
its  advisory  committees  begin  to  discuss  the  project  performance.  This  provides  ad-
ditional pressure on the project to work to the budget. There are no guarantees that
any project will come in on-budget, but the cost-capped missions do have a number
of  mechanisms  that  help  this  situation.  The  recent  emphasis  on  the  experience  of
the  PI  before  selection,  and  on  the  performance  of  the  PI  during  development  and
construction,  provides  an  additional  pressure  point  on  the  project.  Overall  it  is  my
view that cost-capped programs are a very desirable component of the mission suite
in SMD, but more realistic cost-caps are needed.
Q2. The  National  Academies  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  rec-
ommends ‘‘emphasis on physical science, engineering, mathematics and informa-
tion  sciences’’,  as  well  as  high-risk  research,  grants  to  early  career  researchers,
and  funding  for  advanced  research  instrumentation  and  facilities,  among  other
actions,  that  can  help  to  foster  innovation  and  sustain  a  strong  economy.  How
relevant are NASA’s space science research programs to these recommendations?
Can  you  offer  any  specific  examples?  NASA’s  science  program  was  not  included
in  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI).  Would  you  advo-
cate NASA’s science programs be made part of the ACI in future budgets? If not,
why not?

A2. How relevant are NASA’s space science research programs to these recommenda-
tions?  NASA’s  science  programs  are  extremely  relevant  to  the  issues  and  concerns
raised in the Gathering Storm report. A substantial fraction of NASA’s science pro-
grams  relate  directly  to  the  areas  highlighted  in  Gathering  Storm  as  needing  em-
phasis, namely physical science, engineering, mathematics and information sciences.
Furthermore,  NASA’s  science  programs  bring  a  largely  unique  coupling  between
academia  (university  and  research  organizations),  industry  (aerospace  contractors)
and government (NASA centers) on cutting-edge, high-technology projects.

Can you offer any specific examples? I think the cost-capped PI missions (e.g., Ex-
plorers, Discovery, Astrophysics Probes, New Frontiers) are particularly good exam-
ples  of  programs  that  have  these  interfaces  and  encourage  innovative  thinking.
However,  at  the  other  end  of  the  cost  scale,  I  also  think  that  missions  like  JWST
are particularly responsive to these recommendations. They bring together the best
people  from  a  wide  range  of  areas,  encourage  them  to  work  together  innovatively
and  demand  cross-cutting  skill  development  that  is  remarkably  valuable  for  all
those  involved.  The  end  product  of  the  JWST  effort  will  be  a  mission  like  Hubble
in  its  likely  impact  and  thus  likely  to  be  the  seed  from  which  great  public  interest
in the physical sciences will grow.

NASA’s  science  program  was  not  included  in  the  President’s  American  Competi-
tiveness Initiative (ACI). Would you advocate NASA’s science programs be made part
of the ACI in future budgets? Given the above aspects and roles of the NASA science
program, and its national recognition, the NASA science program should be consid-
ered  especially  deserving  of  any  funding  gains  that  might  grow  from  Gathering
Storm and, in particular, therefore deserving of inclusion in ACI. I personally advo-
cate,  very  strongly,  that  NASA’s  science  programs  be  made  part  of  ACI  in  future
budgets,  and  hope  that  Congress  is  willing  to  support  and  increase  funding  for
NASA’s  science  programs  as  part  of  its  Innovation  Initiative.  The  AAAC  has  also
endorsed  this  approach  through  one  of  its  primary  recommendations  for  NASA  in
the 2007 AAAC Annual Report:

‘‘The  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI)  recognized  the  challenges  faced
by  the  Nation  in  staying  at  the  forefront  of  scientific  and  technological  develop-
ment.  Research  is  essential  to  innovative  activities  and  underpins  a  techno-
logically-competitive  society,  as  highlighted  in  the  NRC  report  Rising  Above  the
Gathering  Storm.  The  exclusion  of  NASA  science  from  the  ACI,  in  contrast  to
the  inclusion  of  DOE  science,  is  inconsistent.  There  is  no  question  that  NASA
is at the cutting-edge of science and technology research.
This  exciting  and  highly  visible  research  contributes  to  the  vitality  of  the  na-
tional  skill  set  and  has  encouraged  young  people  to  move  into  science  and  engi-
neering.  The  Congressional  interest  in  Innovation  and  Competitiveness  enables
a fresh opportunity for enhancing NASA science. The AAAC strongly encourages
Congress to consider enhancing the support for science at NASA explicitly to im-
prove  innovation  and  competitiveness,  as  has  been  done  for  NSF  and  DOE
science.’’

Q3. A recently released study of the National Academy of Sciences on Building a Bet-
ter  NASA  Workforce  recommended  that:  ‘‘. . .NASA  increase  its  investment  in
proven  programs  such  as  sounding  rocket  launches,  aircraft-based  research,
and  high-altitude  balloon  campaigns,  which  provide  ample  opportunities  for
hands-on flight development experience at a relatively low cost of failure.’’
a. Could you please explain in concrete terms how the sub-orbital programs are

used to train students and young workers?

b. What  do  these  sub-orbital  programs  typically  cost  and  do  they  produce  peer-

reviewed research?

A3. A  continuing  concern  for  the  science  community  has  been  the  ability  to  train
young  researchers  in  the  complexities  and  details  of  space  science  missions.  This
has  traditionally  happened  through  the  sub-orbital  programs  (rockets  and  balloons
most  typically  for  Astrophysics)  and  through  the  Explorer-class  missions.  However,
the  Explorer-class  missions,  even  small  Explorers  (SMEX),  happen  rarely,  involve
long timescales from proposal to fruition (typically five years or more), and are now
at  cost  levels  (∼$300+M  for  an  Explorer  and  >$100M  for  a  SMEX)  that  makes  stu-
dent  and  postdoctoral  involvement  challenging.  The  sub-orbital  programs  appear  to
be  the  best  mechanism  for  doing  these  ‘‘training’’  activities.  While  I  have  no  direct
experience with the sub-orbital program, recent discussions confirmed my view that
the  rocket  program,  as  an  example,  allows  for  direct,  end-to-end,  hands-on  involve-
ment  by  students  and  postdocs  and  so  can  provide  for  substantially  training  that
is  of  great  value  in  building  up  a  cadre  of  researchers  who  have  developed  signifi-

104

cant  experience  with  doing  science  in  space.  The  sub-orbital  program  faces  chal-
lenges  in  the  present  funding  environment,  like  many  areas,  and  it  would  be  valu-
able  for  the  upcoming  Decadal  Survey  to  assess  its  value  for  training  and  science,
and  to  provide  some  guidance  on  the  role  that  the  sub-orbital  program  should  play
in the coming decade in astrophysics.

Could you please explain in concrete terms how the sub-orbital programs are used
to  train  students  and  young  workers?  As  an  example  (which  surely  varies  by  pro-
gram in its details), a typical rocket flight can give a student or postdoc insight into
most of the elements that constitute a ‘‘science’’ space mission. A typical rocket pro-
gram  might  run  from  instigation  to  published  results  in  a  couple  of  years.  The
young  researchers  involved  with  a  program  could  be  involved  in  concept  develop-
ment  and  science  experiment  ‘‘design,’’  to  hardware  design,  through  ‘‘bread-board-
ing’’ to construction and testing in the home institution, to integration at the launch
facility  (at  NASA’s  Wallops  Flight  Facility),  launch  and  science  data  acquisition
(even doing real-time control of the experiment), and then to data analysis and pub-
lication. If the peer-reviewed publication that results is done by a graduate student,
then  that  publication  would  constitute  a  significant  part  in  the  Ph.D.  thesis  of  the
student.  Being  involved  in  this  sequence  of  events,  with  the  interactions  with  engi-
neering  personnel  and  rocket  operations  personnel,  gives  a  young  researcher  valu-
able  insight  into  the  steps  involved  in  doing  space  mission  development.  They  can
build  on  this  subsequently  with  involvement  in  more  complex  and  expensive  pro-
grams and missions.

What  do  these  sub-orbital  programs  typically  cost  and  do  they  produce  peer-re-
viewed research? The sub-orbital program is distinguished by being inexpensive (rel-
ative  to  orbital  missions).  The  2007  budgets  for  sounding  rockets,  balloons  and  air-
craft  at  Wallops  are  $32M,  $22M  and  $10M.  These  are  modest  programs  in  NASA
terms.  The  flight  opportunities  for  rockets  and  balloons  are  typically  ∼20  per  year.
A  typical  rocket  mission  is  thus  in  the  million-dollar  range  ($1–2M),  very  low  com-
pared  to  any  Explorer.  Balloon  programs  have  also  been  of  significant  value  to  the
overall  science  program,  and  provide  similar  training  opportunities  at  similar  mod-
est  cost  (by  space  mission  standards).  Of  course,  the  science  returns  from  a  typical
sub-orbital  program  are  less  than  from  an  Explorer,  as  would  be  expected,  but  the
combination  of  training  and  science  from  the  sub-orbital  program  is  of  great  value.
Even though the costs are modest these programs are quite competitive and involve
selection through peer-review. The sub-orbital programs have consistently produced
peer-reviewed  research.  It  is  well  recognized  in  the  community  that  one  must  pub-
lish in peer-reviewed Journals to be seen as successful, and the same is true if one
is  to  be  competitive  in  subsequent  competitions  for  R&A  support  and  access  to  the
sub-orbital facilities. The research from the sub-orbital program has played a signifi-
cant role in a large number of Ph.D. theses, as noted above, and resulted in publica-
tion  in  peer-reviewed  journals.  The  peer-reviewed  research  productivity  has  then
been a factor in the peer-reviewed selection of subsequent sub-orbital proposals.
Q4. NASA’s Research and Analysis (R&A) programs are mentioned as being critical
for  developing  new  mission  concepts  and  advanced  technology.  What  impacts
will the cutbacks in R&A have on the opportunities for future missions and pro-
grams?  If  R&A  remains  at  current  levels,  what  are  we  likely  to  see,  or  not  see,
in the next five years?

A4. Research and Analysis (R&A) funds are used for a very wide range of activities
related to the NASA science program. These are directly relevant for science produc-
tivity  and  science  preparation  for  future  programs  through  the  theory  component,
through a variety of diversified research activities that improve the foundations and
underpinnings  of  the  scientific  framework,  and  through  training  and  development
of young scientists. These young scientists are the future researchers who will both
implement  and  provide  the  scientific  returns.  Furthermore,  R&A  funds  have  been
used  for  technology  development  and  for  mission  concept  development.  Major
projects,  in  particular,  typically  take  decades  from  concept  development  to  launch.
This  was  true  of  AXAF  (Chandra),  which  was  developed  conceptually  back  in  the
1970s  and  eventually  launched  in  1999  after  20+  years.  The  same  was  true  of
SIRTF  (Spitzer),  which  also  took  some  20+  years  from  initial  conceptualization  to
launch. NGST (JWST) will launch in 2013, but the first international workshop took
place  in  1989.  I  personally  was  a  co-organizer  on  that  workshop  and  know  directly
the importance of support in the early stages for concept development. During much
of  the  1980s  and  1990s  key  technologies  were  developed  for  these  and  other  mis-
sions  (including  the  HST  2nd  and  3rd  generation  instruments)  using  a  variety  of
funding  sources,  but  many  development  activities  by  scientists  and  organizations
were  carried  out  using  R&A-like  funds.  It  is  hard  to  quantify  the  role  that  R&A
funds played, and would require a substantial effort to trace the use of funds in the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

105

early  stages  of  mission  development  and  their  ultimate  role  in  early  project  and
technology development. The anecdotal evidence is widespread, however, with many
senior  scientists  noting  how  support  for  them  allowed  for  significant  efforts  on  the
early phases of major projects, both on hardware development and on concept devel-
opment.

What  impacts  will  the  cutbacks  in  R&A  have  on  the  opportunities  for  future  mis-
sions and programs? The level of effort in such areas is now substantially less, even
within the NASA centers, and considerable concern exists that we are not investing
enough for the missions of the next decade and beyond. I do not see the same level
of  involvement  in  future  missions  and  programs  that  existed  in  the  1990s.  I  think
that  the  involvement  of  the  University/academic  community  in  long-range  develop-
ment is not at a healthy level for providing the ground-work for the major missions
of  the  next  decade  and  beyond,  nor  even  for  the  next  round  of  larger  cost-capped
missions.  Innovative  efforts  are  being  limited  by  R&A  funding  shortfalls.  The  level
of  funds  available  for  small  missions,  like  Explorers,  has  an  impact  too.  The  recent
SMEX  (Small  Explorer)  announcement  is  good,  but  they  provide  less  opportunities
for Astrophysics than for Heliophysics—the Astrophysics science opportunities with-
in the SMEX size, weight and orbital constraints are limited.

If R&A remains at current levels, what are we likely to see, or not see, in the next
five  years?  Unfortunately,  since  it  takes  about  five  years  to  do  even  the  smallest
missions,  any  changes  that  we  implement  now  will  not  have  an  impact  for  longer
than five years. This is why the dramatic decrease in missions in SMD beyond 2009
(and in Astrophysics in particular) is such a concern (see the Figure below from my
testimony  to  the  Subcommittee).  To  increase  the  mission  frequency  by  the  middle
of  the  next  decade  will  require  an  increase  in  the  budget  for  small  and  moderate
missions in the next couple of years.

Q5. In your view, what role does the structure of the advisory system play in ensur-

ing the strength of the space science programs?

A5. I  have  been  involved  with,  and  on,  advisory  committees  for  the  agencies,  and
NASA  in  particular,  for  some  20  years,  and  will  have  chaired  the  Astronomy  and
Astrophysics  Advisory  Committee  (AAAC)  for  four  years  when  my  term  ends  next
year.  It  is  my  view,  based  on  this  extensive  experience,  that  the  advisory  structure
for  the  science  agencies  plays  an  incredibly  important  role  as  an  interface  between
the community—which sets the broad goals, defines the mission or project suite, and
carries  out  the  scientific  research  program—and  the  agency  which  implements  and
manages  the  very  complex  missions  and  projects,  and  enables  the  science  program.

106

The management and implementation of these activities is clearly an agency respon-
sibility, but the effectiveness of their role is crucially dependent on a continuing dia-
logue  and  advice  from  the  community  as  the  implementation  realities  impact
projects, and as agency budgets and goals evolve. This is particularly true of NASA
where  there  is  a  very  complex  set  of  interfaces  with  the  agency,  both  at  HQ  and
the  Centers,  the  science  community  and  with  the  contractors,  and  where  the  polit-
ical environment plays such an important role (given the fiscal scale of the missions
being  undertaken).  The  AAAC  paid  particular  attention  to  the  lack  of  an  advisory
process  in  2005  and  early  2006  when  the  NASA  advisory  process  was  in  abeyance,
and  wrote  extensively  about  its  importance.  The  AAAC  followed  up  on  this  in  its
most  recent  2007  report.  The  AAAC  summary  statements  regarding  advisory  com-
mittees at NASA for the science program are given below:

The AAAC statement regarding the NASA science advisory structure in our 2006
report  was:  ‘‘For  the  past  year  the  lack  of  an  advisory  structure  for  NASA—and  for
science  at  NASA—has  been  a  deep  concern  for  the  community.  By  the  time  the  new
science  advisory  committees  are  selected,  approved  and  assembled,  a  year  will  have
passed  without  discussions  on  issues  that  are  critical  for  the  community  and  for
NASA  science.  During  that  time,  far-reaching  decisions  were  made  without  any  sci-
entific  input  (e.g.,  the  effective  cancellation  of  SOFIA  whose  budget  was  reduced  to
$0  in  FY  2007  and  beyond  without  a  review).  The  AAAC  welcomes  the  creation  of
a  new  advisory  structure.  However,  we  and  others  are  concerned  that  this  structure
may not be as effective as that previously employed. The lack of close coupling of the
science subcommittees to the SMD leadership is likely to be a significant impediment.
The AAAC has every hope that the new structure will work effectively and in a timely
way  by  providing  feedback  to  SMD  quickly  with  minimal  modification.  However,  if
the  structure  is  perceived  by  either  party  to  be  ineffective,  the  AAAC  hopes  that  the
Administrator  and  the  Associate  Administrator  for  Science  will  evolve  the  structure
to  better  serve  NASA  and  the  community.  These  committees  play  an  essential  role
in  optimizing  the  science  program  within  the  programmatic  and  budgetary  con-
straints  faced  by  the  agency  and  thus  are  of  great  value  both  to  NASA  and  to  the
community.  The  NASA  advisory  process  has  been  a  mainstay  of  a  productive  and
mutually beneficial relationship with the space and earth science community, includ-
ing  the  astronomy  and  astrophysics  community.  The  AAAC  considers  effective  advi-
sory  committees  to  be  essential  for  developing  consensus  and  support  for  an  effective
science program.’’

The AAAC statement regarding the NASA science advisory structure in our 2007
report was: ‘‘The AAAC expressed great concern last year in our report about the lack
of an advisory process at NASA. We were very encouraged when the new NASA advi-
sory  committees  were  established.  The  new  structure  does  differ  from  that  used  pre-
viously,  providing  a  clearer  path  for  advice  to  the  Administrator.  The  new  structure
has, however, lost a valuable role that was once provided by the Space Science Advi-
sory Committee (SScAC). That structure encouraged dialogue, on wide-ranging issues
that cut across the SMD divisions, between SMD and a broadly-representative group
from the science community. An improved interface with SMD is in the best interests
of both NASA and the science community to restore this important two-way commu-
nication  link  that  has  contributed  to  the  success  of  NASA  science  in  the  past.  The
AAAC  welcomed  the  re-establishment  of  the  advisory  structure  at  NASA  last  year,
but  notes  that  dialogue  between  SMD  and  a  broadly-representative  group  from  the
science community is missing in the new structure.’’
Q6. Your testimony mentions the creation of an ExoPlanet Task Force that will con-
sider the missions and science related to the search for extrasolar planets. What
is  the  charge  for  this  task  force?  Will  it  provide  advice  on  the  future  direction
for the SIM and TPF missions?

A6. The  ExoPlanet  Task  Force  is  a  subcommittee  of  the  AAAC.  The  charge  letter
is attached separately, along with the request letter from the AAAC. These can also
be  found  on  the  AAAC  website  (see:  http://www.nsf.gov/mps/ast/exoptf.jsp),  along
with  the  list  of  members.  The  AAAC  requested  that  the  agencies  consider  setting
up  a  task  force  to  assess  how  to  move  forward  in  a  coordinated  way  (ground  and
space)  on  extra-solar  planet  detection  and  characterization.  The  core  statement  of
that letter was:

‘‘Over the last year there have been discussions at several AAAC meetings about
establishing  an  ExoPlanet  Task  Force  (ExoPTF)  to  assess  approaches  and  op-
tions for extra-solar planet detection and characterization, using both space and
ground-based  facilities.  Planet  searches  are  technically  challenging  and  projects
that  will  enable  major  advances  have  long  development  lead-times  and  will  be
costly. Planned space missions and major ground-based instruments will provide

107

near-to-intermediate  term  results,  but  the  way  forward  on  a  synergistic,  cost-ef-
fective  approach  involving  both  space  and  ground-based  facilities  remains  un-
clear.  In  the  2006  AAAC  Annual  Report  the  AAAC  recommended  the  formation
of  such  a  task  force  later  this  year  so  that  its  report  would  be  available  late  in
2007 or early in 2008, providing guidance both to the agencies and the upcoming
Astronomy Decadal Survey.’’

What  is  the  charge  for  this  task  force?  The  charge  letter  consists  of  three  pages
of background, a broad statement of the charge, and ten explicit questions to be ad-
dressed  by  the  committee.  The  broad  statement  of  the  charge  from  the  attached
charge letter is:

‘‘The  ExoPTF  is  asked  to  recommend  a  15-year  strategy  to  detect  and  charac-
terize  exo-planets  and  planetary  systems,  and  their  formation  and  evolution,  in-
cluding specifically the identification of nearby candidate Earth-like planets and
study  of  their  habitability.  The  strategy  may  include  planning  and  preparation
for  facilities  and  missions  beyond  the  15-year  horizon.  Since  future  funding  lev-
els  are  uncertain,  and  project  costs  are  difficult  to  establish  at  an  early  stage,
it is important to develop an efficient and adaptable plan. To the extent possible,
the recommendations should accommodate a range of funding levels representing
conservative  and  aggressive  programs.  The  ExoPTF  will  work  in  cooperation
with agency efforts to advance the justification, specification and optimization of
planet finding and characterizing opportunities.’’

Will  it  provide  advice  on  the  future  direction  for  the  SIM  and  TPF  missions?  The
ExoPTF will certainly be thinking about SIM and TPF and their role in the overall
suite of missions, telescopes, instruments and projects that will be part of the frame-
work  for  the  next  decade  or  so  of  extra-solar  planetary  research.  The  committee  is
being asked to provide guidance on the type of capabilities and sequencing of capa-
bilities  that  are  needed  to  undertake  a  vibrant  program  of  extra-solar  planetary
studies.  They  are  being  asked  to  not  consider  specific  missions,  but  the  expectation
is  that  they  will  provide  guidance  and  recommendations  which  will  bear  strongly
on  the  role  that  SIM  and  TPF-like  missions  will  play  in  the  coming  1–2  decades.
Q7. Please  provide  your  recommendations  for  what  the  highest  priority  uses  of  any
additional  resources  should  be  if  they  become  available  for  science  at  NASA  in
the FY08 appropriations process?

A7. At  the  highest  level  I  think  it  is  important  to  enhance  the  science  budget  for
NASA.  The  NASA  science  program  has  been  incredibly  effective  in  its  exploration
of new frontiers and in its coupling to the American public through a very effective
outreach  program.  The  strength  of  the  response  to  the  Hubble  cancellation  was  a
testament  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  science  program  in  coupling  with  the  public’s
imagination.  Thus  I  feel  that  NASA  and  SMD  should  get  at  least  the  funding  level
in  the  FY08  budget  request.  Furthermore,  I  would  hope,  as  enunciated  above,  that
NASA SMD is seen in the same light as NSF, DOE science and NIST and gets ACI-
like  increases  which  set  it  on  a  track  for  substantial  recovery  and  increases  in  the
FY08  appropriation  (through  the  Congressional  Innovation  effort,  for  example)  that
are  above  the  FY08  request.  Increases  in  the  SMD  budget  at  the  ∼7  percent  level,
like  the  ACI  increases  at  the  other  agencies,  would  do  much  to  restore  the  vitality
of  the  science  program.  These  funds  would  provide  a  much  more  robust  future  for
the  science  program  by  increasing  the  mission  flight  rate  in  the  next  decade,  and
would generate greater science return and output from the current and near-future
missions.

I believe that the details of how these funds would best be used would be through
discussion  by  SMD  with  its  advisory  committees.  In  the  spirit  of  the  question  how-
ever, I personally think that additional resources would be most effectively used for
(i) recovery and increases in peer-reviewed and competed R&A funding, (ii) a variety
of peer-reviewed and competed technology development programs (particularly those
that encourage the science community to invest effort on technologies with their stu-
dents and young researchers—I would be less supportive at this stage of those funds
going  largely  to  the  NASA  Centers  and/or  contractors  for  technology  development),
and  (iii)  more  cost-capped  missions  of  the  Explorer,  Discovery  or  Astrophysics
Probes scale. I think that relatively modest investments in these areas would return
a  great  deal  of  scientific  results,  begin  development  of  new  concepts,  and  provide
opportunities  for  a  wider  range  of  science  missions  on  relatively  short  timescales.
Q8. In  your  testimony,  you  highlighted  the  importance  of  obtaining  both  more  real-
istic  cost  estimates  of  missions,  including  the  use  of  life  cycle  costs.  You  gave
some examples, but it would be useful for the Subcommittee to have a tabulated
summary  of  life  cycle  mission  costs  for  past  and  present  astrophysics  missions

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

108

on  a  uniform  basis  (as  much  as  is  practical)  in  current  dollars  including  full-
cost  accounting  estimates,  with  any  assumptions  given  as  well.  Please  provide
that  information  to  the  Subcommittee,  working  with  NASA  to  ensure  that  the
cost numbers are developed consistently.

A8. The  importance  of  having  life  cycle  costs  for  missions  has  been  dramatically
demonstrated over the last few years. The use of ‘‘construction costs’’ in community
discussions  has  contributed  to  ‘‘under-costing.’’  For  many  programs  the  bulk  of  the
costs are not in construction (Phase C/D) but actually in Phase B and earlier activi-
ties,  and  in  operations.  An  extreme  example  is  SOFIA  which  stands  at  $3.4B  life
cycle  (in  actual  year  dollars),  but  whose  Phase  C/D  costs,  while  hard  to  define  be-
cause of the poor management oversight and structure for this program, is probably
around $0.6B. Even for major missions such as JWST and SIM, the Phase C/D costs
are about 30–40 percent of the total. For planning it is essential to develop reliable
cost  estimates  and  to  use  life  cycle  costs  (over  the  lifetime  of  the  mission)  in  the
discussions between NASA and the community. This will ensure that program plan-
ning within the astrophysics Decadal Survey, and subsequent agency roadmaps, can
be carried out within likely budgets.

The  Table  below  summarizes  life  cycle  mission  costs  (LCC)  in  constant  2007  dol-
lars,  with  a  summary  of  the  caveats/comments  appropriate  for  the  derivation  of
these  numbers.  These  numbers  are  from  the  NASA  Science  Mission  Directorate
(SMD).  Since  these  numbers  were  derived  by  NASA,  I  would  hope  they  become  the
baseline numbers for subsequent discussions of mission costs. Obviously taking costs
from  past  missions  done  under  very  different  accounting  structures  and  converting
them  to  present  day  structures  will  be  uncertain,  but  they  provide  a  very  useful
guideline for planning purposes and for setting the scale for missions under discus-
sion. They are estimated as likely to be accurate to better than 10 percent, probably
about  ±5  percent.  I  would  like  to  express  my  deep  appreciation  to  the  NASA  SMD
leadership for providing these numbers and notes for the response to this question.

Questions submitted by Representative Ken Calvert
Q1. What metric should NASA use to establish an appropriate level of technology de-
velopment  investment  across  the  programs?  Should  it  be  a  percentage  of  the
overall program funding, or should it be a fixed amount?

A1. What metric should NASA use to establish an appropriate level of technology de-
velopment  investment  across  the  programs?  The  level  of  technology  development
funding required for a given project will depend on a number of factors. My feeling
is  that  there  are  three  primary  factors:  (i)  the  maturity  of  the  technology,  (ii)  the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:51 Aug 03, 2007 Jkt 034907 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\SA07\050207\34907 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

109

maturity of the project, and (iii) the scale of the project. There will be a wide disper-
sion  in  the  needed  funding  for  technology,  but  all  science  projects  are  demanding
of  technology  and  require  early  technology  development  to  minimize  risk  and  mini-
mize  overall  cost.  During  the  early  phases  of  a  project  the  cost  of  developing  and
retiring  technologies  can  be  rather  small,  though  there  are  disadvantages  to  work-
ing some technologies too far ahead of the mission (they could become outdated). For
Discovery  and  Explorer-class  missions,  even  funding  levels  around  $1M/yr  at  the
pre-proposal  and  Phase  A  stage  can  make  a  significant  difference  in  the  maturity
of  the  technologies  and  the  likelihood  that  the  mission  can  be  selected  and  imple-
mented  effectively.  This  is  not  the  case  with  larger  missions.  Even  during  their
early  phases  they  may  require  budgets  more  like  $10M/yr  to  make  significant
progress, in part because a number of key technologies must be developed and dem-
onstrated.  The  AAAC  in  its  deliberations  and  discussions  with  NASA  personnel
came  to  see  at  least  $10M/yr  as  a  figure  that  was  needed  for  missions  like  Con-X,
LISA,  and  TPF  to  develop  to  the  point  where  useful  assessments  could  be  made  of
their likely cost and readiness for moving ahead for further development.

The  funding  required  when  missions  transition  to  Phase  B  can  be  significantly
higher.  Substantial  funding  was  needed  for  AXAF  (Chandra)  to  develop  the  mirror
technology  to  the  point  where  the  project  could  convince  review  boards  that  the
project  was  ready  to  move  forward.  The  approach  currently  being  taken  by  JWST
is  one  that  was  chosen  after  it  was  realized  that  much  of  the  cost  growth  in  the
HST program came because required technologies were being developed during con-
struction (Phase C/D). This can lead to large cost overruns when the marching army
pauses  because  of  a  problem  in  a  key  system.  While  JWST  has  had  its  problems,
we  should  not  lose  site  of  the  very  rational  approach  that  was  developed  with  this
mission  based  on  the  experience  with  HST  (and  others  such  as  AXAF)—that  is,  all
technologies  should  be  at  TRL–6  before  JWST  transitions  to  Phase  C/D.  The  goal
is  have  this  project  proceed  rapidly  through  construction  (Phase  C/D)  in  ∼5  years,
with minimal risk of delays from unresolved technology issues.

My  view  is  that  the  approach  should  be  (i)  early,  careful  assessment  of  the  key
technologies, with emphasis on identifying all of them well in advance, (ii) plans to
develop  them  to  TRL–6  before  Phase  C/D,  and  (iii)  assessment  of  the  timing  such
that they reach maturity at the needed time (before the end of Phase B). In parallel
with these developments, the value and power of integrated modeling has been rec-
ognized  in  many  industries  as  providing  a  (relatively)  low  cost  cross-check  on  the
performance  of  the  final  product.  Modeling  is  no  substitute  yet  for  extensive  sub-
system and system level testing, but it provides an extremely powerful cross-check.
Integrated  models  should  also  be  developed  early  and  refined  as  the  system  devel-
ops.

Should  it  be  a  percentage  of  the  overall  program  funding,  or  should  it  be  a  fixed
amount? I think that experience has shown that a fractional amount is more appro-
priate,  though  the  percentage  is  hard  to  establish.  As  a  ballpark  I  might  suggest
one  percent  per  year  of  the  expected  total  program  cost  in  the  very  early  phases,
rising to a total expenditure of tens of percent during Phase B, so as to adequately
retire risk before construction commences. I would suggest eliciting further input on
this topic from others with extensive project experience.
Q2. What  mission  assurance  and  management  requirements  imposed  by  NASA  do
you  believe  are  counter-productive  or  impose  costs  that  are  disproportionate  to
the size of the mission, or that offer little added value?

A2. I recognize and agree with the goal of minimizing mission costs. Clearly, we can
do  more  missions  within  the  available  budget  if  we  can  lessen  the  cost  of  missions.
However, in thinking about this I came to the conclusion that much of the oversight
within  the  current  mission  assurance  and  management  structure  is  necessary.  The
missions that we do, even the smaller cost-capped missions, are generally very com-
plex and technologically challenging. The larger missions stretch our collective abili-
ties  to  manage  them.  The  teams  that  work  these  missions  consist  of  project  man-
agers,  engineers,  scientists  and  support  personnel,  from  the  contractors,  the  NASA
centers  and  the  academic  and  scientific  community.  They  deal  with  very  complex
issues, with tight deadlines and with tight budget constraints. The teams hold eval-
uations  and  progress  assessment  meetings  on  timescales  of  weeks  and  months.
These meetings deal with detailed project issues and problems as they arise—which
tends  to  be  frequently.  Fewer  meetings  might  help  progress  at  times,  but  having
fewer  will  also  allow  some  problems  to  persist  longer  than  they  should  and  require
greater efforts and costs for recovery actions.

While  these  rather  routine  meetings  are  part  of  the  process,  there  is  another  as-
pect that is crucial for our most challenging missions (and possibly even for our less
challenging missions, as I will note below). My view is that it is crucial to have inde-

pendent,  external  oversight  boards  and  teams.  These  boards  should  consist  of  a
small  number  of  people  who  have  a  great  deal  of  project  experience,  who  are  inde-
pendent of the project and report to NASA HQ above the project and program level.
They  should  meet  often  enough  that  they  are  conversant  with  the  project,  but  not
so  often  that  their  independence  is  lost.  From  watching  the  JWST  project  over  the
last  few  years  it  is  my  understanding  that  such  groups  are  now  in  place  and  that
they appear to be fulfilling a very important role.

By putting such groups in place at an earlier time in major projects I would hope
that  some  of  the  problems  with  missions  like  JWST  in  its  earlier  days  could  be
averted.  We  have  now  done  many  large  science  missions  and  it  would  be  useful  to
have a ‘‘lessons-learned’’ assessment at some point before we embark on others. And
it  is  not  just  the  most  challenging  missions  like  JWST  that  develop  problems.  As
an  example  of  when  projects  go  awry,  SOFIA  should  be  an  excellent  case  study.  It
is  dramatically  behind  schedule  and  over  budget,  yet  it  is  not  one  of  NASA’s  most
challenging missions. In fact, it is probably at the less demanding end of the range
technically.  Yet  when  it  finally  reaches  science  operations  it  will  be  approaching  a
decade  behind  schedule  (aircraft  completion  and  science  operations  were  quoted  in
1999  as  being  on  track  for  startup  in  2001!).  I  think  it  is  an  example  of  poor  man-
agement  and  inadequate  oversight,  and  would  hope  that  lessons  are  learned  also
from this program to lessen the chance of a repeat occurrence.
Q3. How should NASA and the space science disciplines best develop estimated mis-
sion  costs,  at  a  reasonable  level  of  confidence,  during  the  next  round  of  decadal
surveys?  Who  should  perform  these  estimates?  What  level  of  confidence  do  you
believe is appropriate?

A3. There is no doubt that better cost estimates are clearly needed for the upcoming
Decadal Survey. The recognition that this was a serious problem for the last Survey
has  led  already  to  extensive  discussion  of  how  to  improve  the  cost  estimates.  It  is
clear  also  that  this  is  a  work  in  progress.  The  BEPAC  study  (the  Beyond  Einstein
Program Assessment Committee) is assessing mission costs in its current evaluation
of  what  should  be  the  first  Beyond  Einstein  mission  to  be  carried  out  early  in  the
next  decade.  Deriving  accurate  costs  is  a  challenge  at  an  early  stage  of  mission  de-
velopment, but it is clear that we do need to do better. Even with the clear recogni-
tion  on  the  Astrophysics  side  that  mission  costs  need  to  be  much  more  reliably  as-
sessed  and  used  in  the  development  of  a  the  Decadal  program,  the  recent  Earth
Sciences  Decadal  Survey  did  a  rather  poor  job  of  costing  the  programs  it  discussed
and recommended. They appear to be systematically underestimated.

How should NASA and the space science disciplines best develop estimated mission
costs,  at  a  reasonable  level  of  confidence,  during  the  next  round  of  decadal  surveys?
There are two steps that need to be taken. The first is to clearly agree that life cycle
costs  will  be  used;  the  second  (below)  is  to  obtain  ‘‘accurate’’  costs.  The  overall  or
life cycle costs should be at least the costs over a 10–15 year period appropriate for
the  recommendations  from  a  Decadal  Survey  group.  The  examples  of  SIM  and
SOFIA, both of which were moderate-size ∼$250M missions in the 1990 Survey, but
which grew to be ∼$3B programs life cycle, provide a sobering lesson. In detail, SIM
was  $250M  in  the  1990  Survey  (as  AIM,  the  Astrometric  Interferometry  Mission),
or  $420M  inflated  to  2007  dollars,  and  was  costed  last  year  in  actual  year  dollars
at  $3.4B  if  launched  in  2015–16,  or  $2.7B  if  launched  in  2011  ($2.6B  in  constant
2007  dollars  for  2015/16  launch—see  Table  above).  SOFIA  was  listed  as  a  $230M
program  in  the  1990  survey,  or  $386M  inflated  to  2007  dollars,  and  is  now,  in  the
FY08 budget request, $3.4B life cycle in actual year dollars ($2.7B in constant 2007
dollars).

JWST  and  Chandra  provide  other  examples  where  our  initial  costs  were  signifi-
cant  underestimates  of  what  the  mission  ultimately  cost.  JWST  went  from  $1B  as
quoted  in  the  2000  Survey,  or  $1.2B  in  2007  dollars,  to  $4.4B  life  cycle,  while
Chandra  went  from  $500M  in  the  1980  Survey,  or  $1.4B  in  2007  dollars,  to  $4.0B
life  cycle  in  2007  dollars  with  full-cost  accounting.  One  should  note  that  the  costs
quoted  from  the  Decadal  Surveys  were  not  usually  life  cycle  costs  (they  were  prob-
ably  closer  to  construction  costs).  However,  they  are  so  different  from  the  reality  of
the  actual  or  expected  life  cycle  mission  costs  that  the  lesson  that  we  must  learn
from  these  comparisons  is  that  we  must  deal  directly  and  thoroughly  with  the  cost
issue and bring the cost estimates closer to reality.

What  level  of  confidence  do  you  believe  is  appropriate?  The  second  important  ele-
ment,  to  make  the  life  cycle  costs  accurate,  is  that  the  costs  for  each  of  the  phases
of  missions  should  be  derived  with  minimal  systematic  underestimation.  This  is
much  more  important  than  having  costs  given  to  many  significant  figures.  It  is
worthwhile to add a note of caution against undertaking very elaborate cost studies
and  expecting  too  much  from  them.  We  are  undertaking  technically-challenging

111

projects  using  cutting-edge  technology.  Getting  costs  to  two  significant  figures  with
small  uncertainty  at  an  early  stage  is  a  practical  impossibility.  But  if  we  can  get
costs to one significant figure with a fair degree of confidence that they are not sys-
tematically underestimated, we will be markedly better positioned for reliable plan-
ning than in previous surveys. Knowing during the Decadal Survey that a program
of  the  scale  of  JWST  is  $4B  instead  of  $2B  or  $3B  would  be  a  major  achievement,
especially if that cost included a significant contingency. Reliably identifying wheth-
er  space  missions  are  at  <$0.5B,  $1B,  $1.5B,  $2B,  $3B  would  be  sufficient  granu-
larity,  in  my  view,  if  the  costs  were  devoid  of  significant  systematic  uncertainties.
Who  should  perform  these  estimates?  A  key  issue  will  be  to  balance  the  level  of
cost  reliability  with  what  can  realistically  be  done  before  and  during  the  Decadal
Survey process. A realistic goal might be to (i) establish common ground rules (e.g.,
any  cost  estimates  would  most  usefully  include  both  full  life  cycle  costs  and  costs
within the coming decade), (ii) provide independent cost estimates (not just cost esti-
mates from the project proponents), (iii) aim to provide costs that are less systemati-
cally underestimated, (iv) aim for accuracy and not precision, and (v) include experts
in  project  management  and  cost  assessment  in  the  deliberations.  In  particular  it
might be useful to have a panel that is used as a resource by other panels to evalu-
ate  costs,  and  to  include  at  least  one  person  with  good  project  oversight/manage-
ment  experience  on  each  panel  to  help  frame  the  right  questions  for  the  ‘‘cost  ex-
pert’’  panel.  NASA  cost  estimation  emphasizes  life  cycle  costs  and  thus  can  provide
feedback  from  considerable  in-house  experience  (e.g.,  see  NASA  Cost  Estimating
Handbook  CEH—at  http://www.nasa.gov/offices/pae/organization/cost¥analysis¥
division.html).  The  Program  Analysis  &  Evaluation  (PA&E)  office  has  provided  a
more  focused  role  for  these 
issues  under  the  new  Administrator  (http://
www.nasa.gov/offices/pae/home/index.html), and provides a web-enabled version of
the  2004  NASA  CEH  or  a  downloadable  pdf  version  at  the  above  URL  for  the  cost
analysis  division.  Furthermore,  if  funding  allows,  it  would  be  very  useful  to  use
independent  organizations,  such  as  Langley  Research  Center  and  Aerospace  Sys-
tems  Design  Lab,  to  provide  some  separate  estimates,  even  if  they  were  ‘‘rough,’’
early-stage estimates.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Daniel N. Baker, Director, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Phys-

ics, University of Colorado, Boulder

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. NASA has imposed cost ‘‘caps’’ on a number of its small- and medium-sized mis-
sion  programs,  such  as  Discovery.  With  the  advent  of  full-cost  accounting,  are
those cost caps still realistic or should they be adjusted? Have the cost caps prov-
en to be an effective tool?

A1. Capping  costs  on  projects  provides  one  part  of  the  framework  for  the  principal
investigator and project manager to actively manage the project. This is healthy for
a  program.  Projects  could  always  use  more  funding  (if  available)  and  so  balancing
costs with scientific return is part of the management challenge. One of the signifi-
cant  factors  in  the  overall  cost  of  missions  is  the  launch  vehicle  cost,  and  factoring
this cost in should be one of the key considerations in setting the mission cap.

The effect of the full-cost accounting on the mission cost cap is somewhat depend-
ent on the mission. The new full-cost accounting rules only apply for the NASA cen-
ters. Other subcontracts for NASA, such as to LASP for satellite instruments, have
been implementing full-cost accounting since the 1990s. Consequently, PI-mode mis-
sions where NASA centers primarily provide oversight have seen minor adjustments
when  NASA  centers  converted  to  full-cost  accounting.  However,  missions  at  NASA
centers  have  seen  significant  growth  in  costs.  Some  growth  has  just  been  in  where
the  cost  is  book  kept,  but  also  some  real  cost  growth  that  would  require  a  higher
cost cap. I believe that NASA centers are able to provide more detailed information
on the specific cost growths that have resulted.

I  believe  that  full  cost  accounting  has  not  been  helpful  to  cost-capped  projects.
Full  cost  accounting  forces  everyone  in  NASA  centers  to  actively  charge  to  a  pro-
gram code. While this might sound like a responsible and sensible approach to man-
aging  cost,  it  is  one  of  the  principal  reasons  for  requirements  creep  in  flight  mis-
sions,  making  management-to-cost  extremely  challenging.  Although  planned  as  an
accounting  change  that  would  be  revenue-neutral,  full  cost  accounting  has,  in  fact,
resulted  in  a  monetary  tax  on  each  program  that  was  not  previously  there.  The
Agency is struggling with this change, as the culture of NASA has in the past been
collaborative  and  collegial  in  nature.  NASA  was  never  a  corporation,  and  full  cost
accounting  is  a  poor  prescription  for  improving  the  Agency’s  performance.  Two  im-
pacts  are  unfortunate:  First,  individuals  within  the  NASA  structure  who  had  not
been  actively  charging  to  programs  are  now  actively  seeking  out  projects  to  charge
to—whether  or  not  they  can  actively  contribute.  This  effectively  creates  a  tax  on
projects.  In  additional  to  direct  costs  rising,  cost-capped  programs  are  being  forced
to  absorb  more  staff  who,  in  turn,  need  to  somehow  demonstrate  their  meaningful
participation. Reviews are longer and more numerous, there are more action items—
many  of  which  are  unnecessary,  yet  need  to  be  addressed—and  consequently  more
inefficiency  as  a  result  of  larger  teams.  Setting  the  idea  of  a  cost  capped  mission
aside,  it  is  the  view  of  myself  and  my  colleagues  at  LASP  that  NASA’s  ability  to
team  and  collaborate  in  a  collegial  way  has  been  hurt  by  the  move  to  full  cost  ac-
counting.
Q2. The  National  Academies  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  rec-
ommends  ‘‘emphasis  on  physical  sciences,  engineering,  mathematics  and  infor-
mation  sciences,’’  as  well  as  high-risk  research,  grants  to  early  career  research-
ers,  and  funding  for  advanced  research  instrumentation  and  facilities,  among
other  actions,  that  can  help  foster  innovation  and  sustain  a  strong  economy.
How relevant are NASA’s space science research programs to those recommenda-
tions? Can you offer any specific examples? NASA’s science program was not in-
cluded  in  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI).  Would  you
advocate  NASA’s  science  programs  be  made  part  of  the  ACI  in  future  budgets?
If not, why not?

A2. NASA  should  be  included  in  the  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI)  as
NASA’s satellite programs are science-based missions that require advanced instru-
mentation,  require  highly  technical  developments  in  many  different  engineering
areas, develop sophisticated data processing and distribution systems, and offer edu-
cation  and  hands-on  training  for  students  and  early  career  researchers.  LASP’s  ex-
perience  with  NASA’s  PI-mode  missions  (SORCE  and  AIM  most  recently)  clearly
support  many  ACI  objectives,  and  this  really  can  be  said  for  most  NASA  missions.

119

It  has  often  been  noted  that  NASA  technology  development  can—and  does—play  a
big role in U.S. economic competitiveness.

NASA  is  becoming  more  aware  of  the  need  to  support  the  recommendations  of
‘‘Gathering  Storm,’’  at  least  as  they  pertain  to  supporting  education  infrastructure
and young scientists. NASA has not fully articulated how the Agency would support
ACI, but it is clear that the shift in EPO (Education and Public Outreach) from K–
12  and  informal  education  now  to  the  inclusion  of  undergraduate  and,  in  some
cases, graduate education is a response to this. There seems to be a growing under-
standing at NASA that universities need to be playing a primary role in this much-
improved EPO effort.

It is unclear why NASA was not invited to join the DOE and the NSF as partners
in  the  ACI.  With  the  emphasis  in  the  ACI  of  connecting  industry,  education  and
government  in  supporting  and  sustaining  innovation  in  science  and  engineering,
surely NASA has a track record that merits its participation. I think it particularly
crucial  that  NASA  be  included  in  the  ACI  at  a  time  when  the  Agency  is  actively
engaged in looking at workforce issues.1 Targeted NASA ACI resources that support
workforce  training,  particularly  in  the  engagement  of  universities  and  sub-orbital
programs, would be ideal.
Q3. A recently released study of the National Academy of Sciences on Building a Bet-
ter  NASA  Workforce  recommended  that:  ‘‘. . .NASA  increase  its  investment  in
proven  programs  such  as  sounding  rocket  launches,  aircraft-based  research,
and  high-altitude  balloon  campaigns,  which  provide  ample  opportunities  for
hands-on flight development experience at a relatively low cost of failure.’’
a. Could you please explain in concrete terms how the sub-orbital programs are

used to train students and young workers?

b. What  do  these  sub-orbital  programs  typically  cost  and  do  they  produce  peer-

reviewed research?

A3. Sub-orbital programs have always had three key elements that differentiate the
work  from  a  larger  space  program:  1)  Sub-orbital  programs  are  typically  hands-on
projects,  providing  participants  with  a  broad  experience  that  is  not  possible  to  get
on  a  larger  project.  2)  Sub-orbital  projects  tend  to  be  of  shorter  duration,  allowing
participants to see the project from start to finish. It is almost always the case that
everyone  on  a  sub-orbital  team  gets  experience  in  all  phases  of  the  effort;  and  3)
Results  are  usually  immediate.  This  ‘‘instant  feedback’’  goes  hand-in-hand  with
trial-and-error  learning  that  cannot  be  experienced  in  larger,  more  risk-adverse
space  programs.  Sub-orbital  programs  have  been  the  training  ground  for  engineers
and  scientists,  and  keeping  these  projects  supported  will  add  to  the  vitality  of  the
space program.
Sub-orbital Student Training

A  typical  sub-orbital  program  at  LASP  includes  support  primarily  for  an  experi-
enced  instrument  scientist,  an  experienced  system  engineer,  a  graduate  student,
and  a  couple  of  undergraduate  students.  The  students,  with  the  help  of  close  men-
toring  from  the  professional  staff,  are  responsible  for  most  of  the  work.  They  are
also heavily involved with the project from cradle-to-grave, as the same students de-
sign instruments, fabricate and assemble the instruments, calibrate and test the in-
struments,  integrate  and  then  launch  the  rocket  payload  at  a  NASA  facility,  and
finally analyze and model the rocket data. All of this work is over a 2–3 year period,
which  is  commensurate  with  a  student’s  timetable  for  completing  college.  In  con-
trast, a typical satellite program at LASP has a duration of about 10 years, and stu-
dent  involvement  on  such  programs  is  necessarily  more  limited.  Typically,  the  stu-
dent will support the professional staff and he/she will not be responsible for major
project development milestones.
Sub-orbital Costs

A typical sub-orbital program at LASP costs about $300K per year and has a du-
ration of three years (two years to develop the payload and launch, with data anal-
ysis in third year). Because the payload is recovered, it can be flown multiple times,
usually  with  enhancements  developed  by  successive  students.  The  LASP  cost  for  a
re-flight is about $150K. In addition to the science payload cost, NASA’s cost for its
rocket subsystems, launch vehicles, and launch range is about $2M per launch.

Peer-Reviewed Research

The NASA sub-orbital program research is peer-reviewed, initially through the re-
search  proposals  that  are  submitted  to  NASA  and  peer-reviewed  by  a  NASA  pro-
posal panel, and later through peer-reviewed research papers as a result of the anal-
ysis of the rocket measurements. The LASP graduate students involved in the sub-
orbital program are expected to write first-authored research papers, and the results
from the rocket flights often lead to a Ph.D. dissertation for the graduate students.
Q4. NASA’s  Research  &  Analysis  (R&A)  programs  are  mentioned  as  being  critical
for  developing  new  mission  concepts  and  advanced  technology.  What  impacts
will the cutbacks in R&A have on the opportunities for future missions and pro-
grams?  If  R&A  remains  at  current  levels,  what  are  we  likely  to  see,  or  not  see,
in the next five years?

A4. Much of the technologies for satellite programs depend on research development
prior to program initiation. Therefore, the NASA Research & Analysis (R&A) funds
are  critical  to  develop  new  instrument  concepts,  detector  technology,  and  satellite
subsystems,  and  then  select  the  best,  most-proven  technology  for  the  satellite
flights.  The  sub-orbital  rocket  program  is  a  excellent  example  where  technology  is
developed quickly to address specific science objectives. These results are then used
successfully for more detailed, thorough investigations on satellite missions that can
last for years.

If R&A remains at current levels, LASP expects that its staff number will shrink
(both science and technical staff) because many employees are still working on mul-
tiple-year grants that were established some years ago when the R&A program was
more  robust.  In  addition,  this  effective  reduction  in  grant  budgets  will  force  LASP
to  reduce  the  number  of  students  involved  in  the  Lab’s  research  projects,  and  lab-
oratory and facility maintenance is likely to suffer.

It  is  likely  that  reducing  of  R&A  programs  will  increase  the  competitiveness  of
the  environment:  Good  researchers  will  potentially  improve,  marginal  researchers
will not be able to make a living in the business, and new people will find increased
difficulty  in  gaining  access  into  space  research.  As  some  point  the  idea  of  a  critical
mass  of  researchers  has  to  enter  into  policy-makers’  thinking.  I  have  great  concern
that we are not at a healthy mass now: smaller definitely is not better.
Q5. What is the current frequency of Explorer and Discovery missions, and what do
you believe should be the frequency of launch opportunities.if we want to sustain
a healthy space science research program in each of the disciplines?

A5. For  Small-class  Explorers  (SMEX),  the  recent  launch  frequency  is  one  every
four years (AIM was launched in 2007 and GALEX was launched in 2003). The next
SMEX, IBEX, is planned for launch in 2008 and then there is a four-year gap until
the next SMEX is launched in 2012.

For  Medium-class  Explorers  (MIDEX),  the  frequency  is  one  every  2.5  years
(SWIFT  launched  in  2004,  THEMIS  in  2007,  and  WISE  is  planned  for  2009).  With
the  current  funding  profile  for  Explorer  program,  there  is  expected  to  be  a  very
large gap until the next MIDEX is launched in 2017!

For Discovery missions, the recent launch frequency is about one every year (Gen-
esis  in  2001,  CONTOUR  in  2002,  MESSENGER  in  2004,  Deep  Impact  in  2005,
DAWN planned in 2007, and Kepler planned in 2008).

For  Earth  System  Science  Pathfinders  (ESSP),  the  launch  frequency  had  been
about  one  every  two  years  (GRACE  in  2002,  CALIPSO  in  2006,  CloudSat  in  2006,
OCO  planned  in  2008,  and  Aquarius  planned  in  2009.  However,  the  HYDROS  mis-
sion  scheduled  for  2011  was  not  selected  for  formulation  and  there  have  been  no
solicitations  for  new  ESSP  missions  since  the  round  that  selected  OCO  and  Aquar-
ius in 2002.

There  are  24  key  measurement  parameters  defined  for  the  NASA  Earth  Observ-
ing  System  (EOS).  Assuming  that  a  small  satellite  (e.g.,  ESSP)  could  measure  two
key  parameters  and  that  each  mission  could  last  for  six  years,  then  the  Earth
Science division needs to have two launches each year.

One  of  the  original  goals  for  these  programs  is  to  have  a  launch  once  a  year  to
keep  the  space  science  research  program  healthy,  so  the  present  mission  lines  are
under-funded  by  about  a  factor  of  two  to  accomplish  this  goal.  At  this  present  pace
of  launch  opportunities,  the  community  is  badly  impacted  in  numerous  ways.  The
chance of being selected in any competition—even for highly experienced teams with
capable  management  skills—is  in  the  neighborhood  of  10–20  percent.  Having  both
infrequent opportunities to propose and small chances of being selected means that
fewer and fewer groups will survive to propose (or will be able to afford to propose).
This  could  be  a  prescription  for  disaster  in  the  science  community.  It  is  crucial  to
get the launch rate for smaller missions to a much higher level.

Questions submitted by Representative Ken Calvert
Q1. What metric should NASA use to establish an appropriate level of technology de-
velopment  investment  across  the  programs?  Should  it  be  a  percentage  of  the
overall program funding, or should it be a fixed amount?

A1. The  present  NASA  science  program  has  very  little  specific  funding  for  instru-
ment  development  or  for  advanced  technology  development.  Many  small-end  mis-
sions  have  been  living  on  ‘‘off-the-shelf’’  instruments.2 This  is  unsustainable.  It  is
crucially  important  that  resources  be  identified  and  made  available  to  raise  instru-
ment and spacecraft technologies to a high readiness level in order to avoid develop-
ment delays when missions are in full implementation phases.

A  percentage  of  program  total  cost  could  be  a  useful  guideline  for  gauging  tech-
nology  development.  Some  missions  will  require  higher  technology  development
than others, and also trades between risk and cutting-edge science is highly depend-
ent  on  the  mission  objectives.  So  like  most  guidelines,  the  technology  development
metric should not be a rigid requirement.
Q2. What  mission  assurance  and  management  requirements  imposed  by  NASA  do
you  believe  are  counter-productive  or  impose  costs  that  are  disproportionate  to
the size of the mission, or that offer little added value?

A2. There  once  was  a  management  belief  at  NASA  that  the  comparatively  lower-
cost and more frequent small satellite programs should require lower quality parts,
fewer documents and processes, and fewer reviews than those for large satellite pro-
grams. The current NASA management approach is largely driven by risk aversion.
Consequently,  requirements  for  small  satellite  programs  have  evolved  to  have  the
same high level of mission assurance and management as that of the large satellite
programs.  However,  the  allocated  resources  for  small  missions  have  remained  rel-
atively low over the past decade. Thus, new small missions are forced to have much
reduced  science  goals  in  order  to  afford  the  higher  cost  mission  assurance  expecta-
tions.  The  space  science  community  generally  supports  having  more  small  satellite
missions that have more science per dollar that can be accomplished by having less
management oversight and accepting higher risks.

The  recent  AIM  spacecraft  launched  by  NASA  (and  managed  by  LASP)  had  54
additional reviews during the course of its development compared to what was budg-
eted  for  the  program  originally.  This  horrendous  additional  load  on  engineers,  sci-
entists,  and  managers  for  the  program  was  nearly  unsustainable.  Such  a  huge  re-
view  load  detracted  from  real  design  and  development  work,  distracted  engineers
and  managers  from  their  real  jobs,  and  for  the  most  part  did  not  add  substantial
value.  Such  out-of-control  risk  aversion  must  be  reigned  in  or  else  NASA  will  not
be able to afford any meaningful science flight program.
Q3. How should NASA and the space science disciplines best develop estimated mis-
sion  costs,  at  a  reasonable  level  of  confidence,  during  the  next  round  of  decadal
surveys?  Who  should  perform  these  estimates?  What  level  of  confidence  do  you
believe is appropriate?

A3. NASA  has  primarily  used  scientists  for  defining  the  mission  concepts  for  its
decadal  surveys.  While  scientists  are  required  to  specify  the  science  objectives  crit-
ical for strategic planning, most scientists are not well trained in costing all compo-
nents  and  phases  of  satellite  missions.  Future  mission  cost  estimates  could  be  im-
proved by having at least two panels, one of primarily scientists for science planning
and one of primarily satellite engineers for mission definition, with significant over-
lap between the panel members.

When  developing  the  first  concepts  for  a  mission,  a  50  percent  margin  (reserve)
is usually added for resources like mass, power, and data rate, and a similar 50 per-
cent  margin  should  also  be  added  to  the  first  cost  estimates.  NASA  missions  have
sometimes  been  defined  with  these  early  mission  concepts  and  then  later  forced  to
reduce  scope  or  have  been  canceled  because  of  exceeding  the  expected  cost  cap.
Starting  with  realistic  cost  estimate  and  with  generous  margin  can  mitigate  this
type of mission development disaster. Recently, the National Research Council pub-
lished  a  report  of  a  workshop  on  decadal  surveys  that  addresses  the  issues  above
in greater detail.3

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Joseph  A.  Burns,  Irving  P.  Church  Professor  of  Engineering  and  As-

tronomy; Vice Provost, Physical Sciences and Engineering, Cornell University

Please recognize that my answers, unless noted otherwise, represent the perspec-
tive  of  someone  who  has  participated  primarily  in  the  exploration  of  the  solar  sys-
tem.  My  knowledge  of  other  disciplines  of  space  science  is  through  reading  and  lis-
tening at committee and department meetings, not through practice.

Questions submitted by Chairman Mark Udall
Q1. NASA  has  imposed  cost  ‘‘caps’’  on  number  of  its  small-  and  medium-sized  mis-
sion  programs,  such  as  Discovery.  With  the  advent  of  full-cost  accounting,  are
those cost caps still realistic or should they be adjusted? Have the cost caps prov-
en to be an effective tool?

A1. As  an  academic  never  involved  in  NASA’s  business  models  and  bookkeeping
procedures,  I  do  not  know  how  full-cost  accounting  has  influenced  the  agency’s  ac-
tual  out-of-pocket  expenses,  nor  its  use  of  federal  employees  vs.  contractors.  Thus
I  cannot  address  whether  the  cost  caps  should  be  adjusted  specifically  to  accommo-
date the agency’s newly instated method of accounting.

I  can  note,  however,  that  any  effectiveness  of  the  cost  caps  in  limiting  expenses
today  has  been  compromised  by  problems  both  inside  and  outside  the  agency’s  con-
trol.  First,  excessive  program  reviews  carried  out  within  NASA  Headquarters  (as
well as those done at its request) have added expense and time to the development
of  missions  [see  the  response  to  Representative  Calvert’s  #2  below].  Furthermore,
the  poor  estimation  of  costs  when  missions  are  proposed  followed  then  by  a  lack  of
discipline as missions are developed has also made it difficult for the agency to carry
through  on  the  caps.  These  failings  by  proposing  teams  mean  that  NASA  is  then
confronted  by  an  unpleasant  choice,  often  late  in  the  game:  either  lose  the  funds
already  spent  or  fly  a  mission  that  accomplishes  little  more  than  previous  flights.
Delays associated with insufficient funds lead to a stutter-step development, further
increasing  costs.  Finally,  cost  caps  over  the  last  few  years  have  had  to  confront
major  cost  breakers  outside  the  agency’s  control,  namely  a  substantial  inflation  in
the  cost  of  launches  plus  the  added  expenses  associated  with  ITAR  requirements.
An important subtext to this topic is specifically what cost caps should particular
mission  classes  have  and  can  effective  missions  be  developed  within  contemporary
cost  caps,  currently  $425  M  (FY06)  for  Discovery  and  $750  M  in  FY07$  for  New
Frontiers, according to the SSE 2006 Roadmap. A simple test exists: are the current
missions in these classes providing good value. Most observers would answer, ‘Yes!’
but  with  some  strain  in  their  voices  concerning  the  future,  as  missions  necessarily
become  more  ambitious  payloads  increase  in  sophistication,  technology  costs  grow
at  above  the  inflation  rate,  and  launch  vehicles  are  less  available  but  more  costly.
Q2. The  National  Academies  report,  Rising  Above  the  Gathering  Storm,  rec-
ommends  ‘‘emphasis  on  physical  sciences,  engineering,  mathematics  and  infor-
mation  sciences,’’  as  well  as  high-risk  research,  grants  to  early  career  research-
ers,  and  funding  for  advanced  research  instrumentation  and  facilities,  among
other  actions,  that  can  help  foster  innovation  and  sustain  a  strong  economy.
How relevant are NASA’s space science research programs to those recommenda-
tions? Can you offer any specific examples? NASA’s science program was not in-
cluded  in  the  President’s  American  Competitiveness  Initiative  (ACI).  Would  you
advocate  NASA’s  science  programs  be  made  part  of  the  ACI  in  future  budgets?
If not, why not?

A2. The influential NAS report Rising Above the Gathering Storm convincingly doc-
uments  and  argues  that  America  must  bolster  its  competitiveness  by  strategically
strengthening those disciplines that most contribute to our global business position.
I  firmly  believe  the  same  point:  the  physical  sciences  and  engineering  are  crucial
if  the  United  States  is  to  remain  internationally  competitive.  It  is  primarily  our
technological prowess that sets the U.S. apart from its economic competitors.

NASA’s  Space  Science  Research  Program  covers  many  economically  important
fields  through  its  support  for  fundamental  research  in  physics,  chemistry  and  biol-
ogy. These sciences contribute directly to placing our nation in the world’s forefront
technologically,  thus  stimulating  the  economy.  This  connection  is  perhaps  a  little
less apparent for the earth sciences, space physics and astronomical sciences. None-
theless  research  in  such  scientific  subjects  benefits  the  mining  and  oil  industries,
the energy sector, telecommunications companies and those investigating plasma fu-
sion. NASA’s space science missions and their instrument payloads have obvious ap-

plications of considerable interest to a number of commercial and defense spacecraft
builders. To mention just a few engineering examples relevant to these latter indus-
tries, NASA’s Space Science Research Program supports instrument design, remote-
sensing  devices  across  a  broad  spectrum,  the  miniaturization  of  advanced  detectors
and image-processing algorithms.

In  addition,  the  space  program  plays  an  important  role  in  our  country’s  science
education at all levels. Images of Earth’s planetary siblings and the wider universe
appeal broadly to the public, especially young people. Such materials help to attract
K–12  students  to  the  STEM  disciplines.  At  the  other  end  of  the  educational  chain,
graduate  students  drawn  to,  and  trained  in,  the  space  sciences  often  move  into  the
commercial and defense sectors upon graduation.

Thus I feel that many of Gathering’s recommendations apply equally to NASA re-
search  as  to  NSF,  DOE  and  DOD  research.  Accordingly  I  urge  Congress  to  include
NASA’s Space Science Program in the President’s American Competitiveness Initia-
tive. Its exclusion was an oversight.
Q3. A recently released study of the National Academy of Sciences on Building a Bet-
ter NASA Workforce recommended that: ‘‘NASA increase its investment in prov-
en  programs  such  as  sounding  rocket  launches,  aircraft-based  research,  and
high-altitude  balloon  campaigns,  which  provide  ample  opportunities  for  hands-
on flight development experience at a relatively low cost of failure.’’
a. Could you please explain in concrete terms how the sub-orbital programs are

used to train students and young workers?

b. What  do  these  sub-orbital  programs  typically  cost  and  do  they  produce  peer-

reviewed research?

A3. Low-altitude terrestrial flights employing rockets, aircraft and balloons are gen-
erally  not  effective  schemes  for  pursuing  planetary research:  missions  can  achieve
much  better  resolution  and  coverage  with  close  planetary  encounters.  Hence  these
Earth-bound  platforms  are  no  longer  actively  employed  by  planetary  scientists.
However,  I  understand  that  the  sub-orbital  program  benefits  other  space-science
disciplines  in  NASA.  This  program  provides  effective  training  for  students  because
its  missions  flown  are  usually  small-scale  and,  of  course,  nearby.  Hence  students
can complete an end-to-end project (wherein they select a topic and target, build ap-
propriate  instrumentation,  launch  and  collect  data,  and  finally  analyze  results)  for
their doctoral dissertations rather than being assigned to a single aspect of research
(e.g.,  data  analysis)  within  a  large  team.  For  students  in  planetary  exploration,
some  of  the  benefits  of  rocket  and  balloon  research  (e.g.,  hands-on)  may  be  gained
by building instruments for Discovery missions.

My  answer  to  this  question  highlights  that  the  various  disciplines  of  space
sciences  may  have  substantial  differences  in  research  techniques  and  funding.  One
of the questions that was asked during our May 2 hearing dealt with data analysis
funds  for  various  missions  and  the  answer  given  by  an  astronomer  on  the  panel
(who  probably  was  considering  the  success  of  the  investigator  support  for  astro-
physics’ ‘‘Great Observatories’’ (e.g., Hubble, Chandra and Spitzer) was that all was
well.  Time  prevented  me  from  mentioning  that  this  is  not  true  for  the  information
returned  by  recent  planetary  missions,  whose  data  analysis  has  been  sorely  under-
funded.  As  a  personal  example,  I  received  no  funds  as  an  associate  of  the  Galileo
mission  to  Jupiter  beyond  travel  support  even  though  I  planned  all  the  image  se-
quences  of  Jupiter’s  rings  and  published  the  primary  papers  interpreting  those  re-
sults. After this several-billion-dollar mission ended, the total funds for the analysis
of  its  returned  data  was  a  few  million  dollars.  As  another  local  illustration,  I  am
a current member of the imaging team on the Cassini mission (the latest solar-sys-
tem-exploration flagship) in orbit about Saturn since 2004, for which my support is
primarily  for  planning  and  archiving  data,  not  for  modeling  or  interpretation.  My
group’s  analysis  of  the  data  is  covered  by  six  weeks  of  summer  salary.  We’ve  been
fairly  effective  only  because  Cornell  has  been  partly  supporting  my  research.  As  in
the  case  of  Galileo,  the  Cassini  data  analysis  program  for  last  year  and  again  this
year  only  receives  about  $2–3  M.  Effectively  the  U.S.  is  annually  spending  about
0.1  percent  of  the  total  planetary  mission  cost  for  the  analysis  of  the  data  that  is
the advertised reason for the mission. This seems very low to me.

The  less  than  optimal  funding  for  doing  science  on  missions  extends  to  the  Dis-

covery line.
Q4. NASA’s  Research  &  Analysis  (R&A)  programs  are  mentioned  as  being  critical
for  developing  new  mission  concepts  and  advanced  technology.  What  impacts
will the cutbacks in R&A have on the opportunities for future missions and pro-
grams?  If  R&A  remains  at  current  levels,  what  are  we  likely  to  see,  or  not  see,
in the next five years?

A4. The researchers supported by R&A funds accomplish more than simply publish
papers  that  interpret  the  data  returned  by  missions.  They  deepen  our  under-
standing  of  our  solar-system  surroundings,  thereby  introducing  new  paradigms  for
how the planets work and how the solar system originated. As a result of these find-
ings,  the  program  as  a  whole  evolves:  new  mission  concepts  and  perhaps  new  tar-
gets are chosen in order to address the latest ‘‘big questions.’’

A large fraction of the R&A monies that are awarded to university staff are used
to hire graduate students. So these funds also produce the next generation of space
explorers, the individuals who will be designing, building and operating future mis-
sions  and  programs.  In  addition,  R&A  dollars  are  used  to  develop  improved  instru-
ments to permit more sensitive and broader observations.

Because  of  the  crucial  role  that  R&A  programs  play  in  shaping  the  future  mis-
sions,  as  laid  out  in  the  paragraphs  above,  the  answer  to  the  last  question  is
straightforward.  If  NASA’s  planetary  R&A  budget  continues  at  its  present  level,
which  is  25  percent  below  FY05  support  and  even  further  beneath  that  rec-
ommended  by  the  2003  decadal  report,  the  program  will  be  addressing  last  year’s
questions with an older, less numerous work force using outdated equipment.
Q5. What is the current frequency of Explorer and Discovery missions, and what do
you believe should be the frequency of launch opportunities if we want to sustain
a healthy space science research program in each of the disciplines?

A5. The Discovery program was initiated to provide a continuing stream of low-cost,
focused,  innovative  missions,  chosen  competitively,  that  would  complement  the
much-less-frequent  but  much  more  competent  and  broader  flagship  missions  that
are  usually  designed  conservatively.  The  Scout  program  serves  the  same  function
within the Mars program. The Discovery line is now fifteen years old, during which
time  seven  missions  have  been  launched,  eight  if  the  Dawn  spacecraft  flies  this
summer  as  planned.  That’s  one  flight  every  22  months,  whereas  the  original  plan
was  to  launch  one  every  18  months.  That  is  a  good  record.  However,  the  selection
rate  has  slowed  dramatically:  after  choosing  a  pair  in  each  of  alternate  years  (FY
95,  FY97,. . .)  no  selections  have  been  made  since  FY01,  although  two  (responding
to  last  year’s  AO)  may  be  yet  chosen  in  FY07.  There  is  a  reasonable  concern  that
this slow rate will continue due to potential future budget reductions with the high-
er cost cap and increased launch costs with the end of the Delta 2 line.

The  New  Frontiers  line  for  medium-scale  missions  was  endorsed  by  the  2003
decadal panel and then placed in the NASA budget. This line was jump-started with
the already-in-process New Horizons (based on an FY01 AO). The rate of New Fron-
tiers too may have slowed; Juno was chosen from an FY05 solicitation and the next
AO  is  yet  to  be  released.  This  slower  pace  for  both  Discovery  and  New  Frontiers
should be placed against the backdrop of the indefinite deferral of both flagship mis-
sions  (Europa  Geophysical  Orbiter  and  Mars  Sample  Return)  recommended  by  the
decadal panel. These delays likely result from the draining of $4B from the science
program,  the  vast  majority  coming  from  solar  system  exploration.  Analysts  suggest
that  a  minimum  of  $200  M  more  annually  would  be  needed  in  the  Planetary
Sciences Division in order to meet the decadal survey’s strategic goals.

Discovery and New Frontiers require frequent launches to fulfill their roles as rec-
ommended by the decadal report. Based on the historical record, 5–6 Discovery mis-
sions  per  decade  should  be  sustainable  along  with  2–3  New  Frontiers  per  decade.

Questions submitted by Representative Ken Calvert
Q1. What metric should NASA use to establish an appropriate level of technology de-
velopment  investment  across  the  programs?  Should  it  be  a  percentage  of  the
overall program funding, or should it be a fixed amount?

A1. While  I  can’t  give  you  an  informed  number,  technology  development  should  be
a fixed percentage or, better, within a fixed range of percentages, flexible on an an-
nual basis, of the total mission development budget. The metric should be developed
depending on the anticipated needs for future missions in the decadal plan.

One  will  want  to  have  a  range  within  which  to  operate,  so  that  the  amount  is
somewhat variable as demand changes. For example, preparations to return a sam-
ple  from  the  Moon  are  quite  different  than  if  we  wish  to  take  a  piece  of  a  comet
back  to  Earth.  Similarly,  it’s  much  easier,  and  already  has  been  demonstrated,  to
drop a long-lived mobile laboratory onto the plains of Mars, than it will be to para-
chute  a  capable  probe  through  Venus’s  lethal  environment  onto  its  scorching  sur-
face.  Any  sophisticated  in-situ  laboratory  will  demand  much  advanced  development

Because  of  this  variability  in  the  sorts  of  technology  development  that  is  required

at  any  particular  time,  it  is  only  rational  if  the  level  of  funding  is  a  percentage  of
overall  program  funding.  However,  what  the  correct  percentage  is  for  the  next  dec-
ade  is  a  question  that  should  be  studied  by  the  NRC.  For  a  well-managed,  focused
program, I would guess that 10 percent is appropriate, but that’s only a guess.

To  some  degree,  however,  this  query  overlooks  another  important  issue.  The  fact
is  that  NASA  technology  development  has  not  generally  been  very  effective  in  cor-
rectly  choosing  and  then  maturing  the  technologies  necessary  for  future  missions.
In  some  areas,  for  example  electronics  and  communications,  the  record  is  a  ‘‘solid
B.’’ In others, for example, sampling devices, it is much less acceptable. What is re-
quired  is  a  prioritized  list  of  critical  technology  for  the  highest  priority  future  mis-
sions  and  then  the  willingness  and  financing  necessary  to  promptly  produce  these
technologies. At present, it’s as much the lack of focus as the lack of funds that has
been a problem.
Q2. What  mission  assurance  and  management  requirements  imposed  by  NASA  do
you  believe  are  counter-productive  or  impose  costs  that  are  disproportionate  to
the size of the mission, or that offer little added value?

A2. The  mission  assurance  and  management  requirements  imposed  by  NASA  are
well  defined  in  its  mission  development  directive  7120.  Any  additional  reviews  are
superfluous  and  of  no  value.  NASA  HQ  should  re-adopt  the  ‘trust  but  verify’  atti-
tude  it  used  to  take  toward  its  mission  implementers.  Currently,  NASA  HQ’s  atti-
tude  is  fearful  and  distrustful,  imposing  costly  and  even  damaging  additional  re-
views  with  every  flight  project  hiccup  or  milestone.  Today’s  world  is  increasingly
risk-averse.  To  mitigate  this,  NASA  should  insist  that  decisions  are  made  at  the
lowest  possible  levels,  by  individuals  who  are  close  to  the  details  and  specifics.
Money  is  wasted  when  inappropriate  requirements  are  imposed  by  someone  far  re-
moved from the actual projects who does not understand what is appropriate.

Furthermore,  the  level  of  management  burden  imposed  should  be  commensurate
with the funds expended. Since New Frontiers missions cost two or three times less
than  Flagship  missions,  whereas  Discovery  missions  typically  cost  one-half  New
Frontiers  missions,  the  Discovery  should  not  be  expected  to  go  through  all  the  bu-
reaucracy appropriate for a Cassini-class endeavor. The agency should be willing to
accept more risk for Discovery than for any other mission class. In the original man-
ifestation  of  Discovery,  a  significant  fraction  of  these  missions  were  expected  to  be
high-risk since in part they demonstrated new technologies. One might ask whether
today’s missions in this line have been aggressive enough since only one has failed,
and that was due to a well-known but occasional flaw in a conventional rocket.

Finally, any group of principal investigators will always, and probably justifiably,

ask that the review processes be streamlined.
Q3. How should NASA and the space science disciplines best develop estimated mis-
sion  costs,  at  a  reasonable  level  of  confidence,  during  the  next  round  of  decadal
surveys?  Who  should  perform  these  estimates?  What  level  of  confidence  do  you
believe is appropriate?

A3. Forecasting  estimated  mission  expenditures  has  been  a  perennial  problem  in
the  space  sciences  and  it  will  never  be  entirely  solved.  Not  every  difficulty  can  be
foreseen  and  some  expenses  lie  outside  the  NASA’s  control,  such  as  launch  charges
as  well  as  the  cost  of  radioisotope  thermal  generators  and  fuel.  The  prices  for  the
development and ultimate construction of new technology items are notoriously hard
to  predict  in  all  the  scientific  disciplines.  Nonetheless,  the  recent  scorecard  within
the agency and in the space industry has been poor. Forecasts of mission costs could
be  improved  significantly  by  spending  more  in  deriving  these  costs.  Enough  effort
needs to be devoted to this early in order to develop a cost estimate that has a rea-
sonable chance to be correct. History indicates that 1–2 percent of the eventual total
mission  price  tag  should  be  invested  to  get  a  reliable  preliminary  estimates  of  mis-
sion  costs.  By  this  metric,  the  $1M  being  spent  on  each  of  the  current  studies  for
outer planet missions is low by a factor of ten.

This indicates that much more investment should be made in order to get reliable
cost  estimates  for  the  prospective  missions  in  the  beginning  stages  of  any  decadal
report. Otherwise the estimates lack credibility, implying that the full report is like-
ly  to  be  unrealistic  advice  and  hence  flawed.  Most  likely  NASA  must  take  this  re-
sponsibility  on  itself  to  use  its  implementers  plus  independent  cost  estimators  to
provide the technical studies and cost estimates. I believe that the NRC has a study
underway about how to properly devise this process. A probable answer is that two
or  three  independent  estimates  are  needed  from  separate  autonomous  institutions.
In order for these estimates to be meaningful, any mission’s concept has to be clear-
ly defined to make sure that each institution is costing the same mission.
