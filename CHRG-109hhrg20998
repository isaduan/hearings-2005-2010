HEARING CHARTER

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT, TECHNOLOGY, AND

STANDARDS

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

China, Europe, and the Use of
Standards as Trade Barriers:
How Should the U.S. Respond?

WEDNESDAY, MAY 11, 2005

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose:

On  Wednesday,  May  11,  at  2:00  p.m.  the  House  Science  Committee’s  Sub-
committee  on  Environment,  Technology,  and  Standards  will  hold  a  hearing  to  re-
view  the  increasing  use  by  U.S.  trading  partners  of  technical  standards  and  other
standards-related  requirements  as  barriers  to  trade,  and  what  U.S.  companies,
standards  development  organizations,  and  the  Federal  Government  are  doing,  and
could do, to overcome or reduce these barriers.
Witnesses:
Dr.  Hratch  Semerjian  is  the  Acting  Director  of  the  National  Institute  of  Stand-
ards and Technology (NIST).
Mr.  Robert  W.  Noth  is  the  Manager  of  Engineering  Standards  for  Deere  &  Com-
pany, headquartered in Moline, Illinois.
Dr.  Don  Deutsch  is  the  Vice  President  for  Standards  Strategy  and  Architecture
for Oracle, headquartered in Redwood Shores, California.
Mr. Joe Bhatia is the Vice President for International Operations at Underwriters
Laboratory  (UL).  UL  is  a  commercial  laboratory  company  that  tests  products
against U.S. and international standards, headquartered in Northbrook, Illinois.
Mr.  David  Karmol  is  the  Vice  President  of  Public  Policy  and  Government  Affairs
at the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

Overarching Questions:

The Subcommittee plans to explore the following overarching questions:

1. What  are  standards  and  why  are  they  important  to  the  global  competitive-

ness of U.S. companies?

2. How are standards developed in the U.S.? How is this different from the way
standards  are  developed  in  our  major  trading  partners  such  as  Europe  and
Asia?

3. Is  the  U.S.  system  at  a  disadvantage  in  the  global  standards  arena?  If  so,
what should the Federal Government, states, U.S. standards development or-
ganizations, and companies be doing to reduce their vulnerability to the use
of  standards  as  trade  barriers,  and  how  could  they  promote  the  adoption  of
non-exclusionary  standards  in  the  global  marketplace?  What  are  the  merits
and drawbacks of these different systems?

Background:
What Is a Standard?

A standard is a technical specification for a product, process, or service. Standards
are  used  to  ensure  uniformity  and  inter-operability.  For  example,  standards  make
it  possible  for  cellular  phones  made  by  different  companies  to  communicate  with
each  other  regardless  of  location.  Standards  ensure  that  the  electrical  power  grid
provides  electricity  to  homes  and  businesses  in  the  same  way  across  the  U.S.  An-

other example of a standard is the worldwide uniform electronic standard that gov-
erns  the  format  of  credit  cards,  enabling  them  to  processed  anywhere  in  the  world
where  credit  cards  are  accepted.  Standards  are  frequently  referenced  by  or  tied  to
government regulations to describe or even dictate the technologies or processes ex-
pected  to  achieve  the  goals  of  regulations,  and  to  ensure  compliance.  For  example,
the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  regulations  for  the  formats  for
black  and  white,  color,  and  high-definition  television  are  based  on  technical  stand-
ards.
Why Are Standards Important?

Standards play a powerful role in domestic and international markets. If a stand-
ard achieves broad acceptance in a market, it may lead to the abandonment of tech-
nologies  supported  by  alternative  standards  and  the  domination  of  a  market  by  a
specific  technology.  An  example  is  the  gradual  loss  of  market  share  by  Sony’s
Betamax video recording standard in the 1980s during the early years of video cas-
sette  recorders  (VCRs),  as  the  Matsushita  VHS  standard  became  more  popular.
Once  the  competition  between  the  two  standards  had  been  resolved  by  the  domi-
nance  of  one  over  the  other,  the  uncertainty  of  which  technology  to  invest  in  dis-
appeared, and the market for VCRs grew rapidly.

Standards  facilitate  the  growth  of  markets  by  assuring  predictability  and  inter-
operability.  For  example,  agreements  between  manufacturers  on  communications
standards provide certainty for the entire cell phone market, ‘‘telling’’ designers and
providers of peripheral services such as e-mail, web services, and the ability to take
and  send  pictures  what  formats  they  need  to  use  to  provide  compatible  add-ons  to
consumers.  If  there  are  multiple  standards  for  a  type  of  product,  the  uncertainty
about  which  standard  will  eventually  dominate  can  paralyze  investments  into  re-
lated technologies, or result in a fragmented market with multiple technologies that
cannot  work  together.  International  standards  promote  international  trade  by  en-
suring  that  the  same  product  can  be  sold  and  used  anywhere,  regardless  of  origin,
which is convenient for manufacturers and customers alike.
How Are Standards Used as Trade Barriers?

Countries can use standards as trade barriers by setting domestic standards that
are  different  from  those  which  foreign  manufacturers  would  have  normally  used.
(This  can  happen  inadvertently  as  well  as  deliberately.)  This  increases  the  costs  of
exporting  to  the  country  in  question  because  the  companies  trying  to  export  there
must change their product lines to meet the special standards requirements of that
country.  The  existence  of  unique  standards  is  also  a  bureaucratic  disincentive  for
exporters  to  do  business,  particularly  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  that  do
not have the resources to learn about, understand, and work through often complex
or  obscure  specifications.  For  example,  countries  may  require  a  different  standard
for safety belts or emission controls in automobiles that must be tested for, or insti-
tute a complicated testing procedure for imported telecommunications goods.

Companies worldwide are worried that such measures could escalate into ‘‘stand-
ards  wars,’’  with  countries  closing  their  markets  to  imports  with  technical  require-
ments,  rather  than  tariffs.  This  concern  was  partly  responsible  for  the  creation  of
the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO),  which  includes  the  Technical  Barriers  to
Trade  (TBT)  agreement,  a  very  detailed  document  that  lays  out  the  principles  that
countries  should  not  use  technical  standards  as  trade  barriers,  should  adopt  inter-
national  standards  whenever  possible  or  practicable,  and  should  work  on  harmo-
nizing  standards  through  international  standards  organizations.  However,  the  TBT
includes  fairly  significant  exceptions  for  countries  to  exercise  their  authority  in  the
areas  of  health,  safety,  and  national  security,  and  it  is  these  exceptions  that  are
often  cited  when  a  country  sets  a  new  standard  to  block  imports.  It  is  important
to note that although U.S. companies frequently complain about technical standards
as  trade  barriers  abroad,  our  trading  partners  frequently  voice  similar  concerns
about  standards  barriers  in  the  U.S.  market,  particularly  with  respect  to  tele-
communications and information technology equipment.

The  following  are  some  examples  of  standards-related  problems  U.S.  companies
are  beginning  to  report  as  presenting  or  potentially  presenting  serious  barriers  to
U.S. trade:

China: Wi-Fi versus WAPI

In  an  effort  to  promote  an  independent  economy  based  on  home-grown  tech-
nologies, China has stated in its standards strategy that it plans to develop manda-
tory  domestic  technical  standards  based  on  Chinese  technology  and  intellectual
property,  rather  than  adopt  existing  industry  or  international  technical  standards
and having to pay license fees for non-Chinese technology.

To  this  end,  in  2004,  the  Chinese  government  announced  that  it  would  require
all  wireless-enabled  devices  to  meet  a  Chinese  wireless  standard,  beginning  June  1
of  that  year.  The  Chinese  standard  is  called  ‘‘WAPI’’—Wireless  Authentication  and
Privacy Infrastructure. The Chinese cited the WTO TBT national security loophole,
saying  that  the  WTO  principles  of  non-discrimination  did  not  apply  in  this  case  for
national  security  reasons.  The  globally  accepted  standard  for  wireless  internet  (Wi-
Fi)  is  IEEE  (Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics  Engineers)  802.11i.  The  global
semiconductor  industry  had  been  manufacturing  their  silicon  chips  to  meet  this
standard and a variety of related electronics manufacturers were designing products
to be compatible with it. What was most distressing to non-Chinese manufacturers,
however,  was  China’s  requirement  that  a  limited  number  of  Chinese  companies
would  be  licensed  to  build  and  certify  products  to  WAPI,  and  any  foreign  manufac-
turer who wanted to comply with the standard and do business in China would have
to partner with a Chinese company.

Responding  to  vigorous  lobbying  by  U.S.  industry,  in  March  2004,  U.S.  Secretary
of  Commerce  Don  Evans,  U.S.  Trade  Representative  Robert  Zoellick,  and  Secretary
of State Colin Powell intervened, and in April 2004, the Chinese government agreed
to  postpone  the  implementation  of  the  standard  indefinitely,  and  participate  in  the
implementation of a global standard.

Since  then,  China  has  been  working  to  get  the  WAPI  standard  accepted  via  the
International  Standards  Organization  (ISO)  process  in  order  to  make  it  an  inter-
national  standard.  The  ISO  is  a  body  made  up  of  representatives  from  100  coun-
tries,  and  is  a  forum  for  the  development  of  global  standards.  Its  deliberations  are
extremely formal and process-oriented. WAPI was considered in February 2005, but
when  the  ISO  voted  to  take  the  WAPI  standard  off  its  ‘‘fast-track’’  process,  China
walked  out  of  the  negotiations,  citing  unfair  treatment.  Some  Chinese  accused  the
U.S.  of  blocking  the  process.  Meanwhile,  IEEE’s  802.11i  standard  was  fast-tracked
for  approval  by  ISO.  There  have  been  no  significant  developments  since  then,  but
China plans to manufacture products for the Chinese market according to the WAPI
standard,  and  hopes  that  market  forces  and  the  size  of  its  domestic  market  will
cause the WAPI standard to be widely adopted.

Standards experts say that, in spite of the apparent setback, China will continue
to  try  to  promulgate  unique,  exclusionary  standards  for  its  domestic  market.  They
also  say  that  China  intends  to  increase  its  presence  within  international  standards
bodies  such  as  the  ISO,  and  is  eager  to  assume  a  leadership  role  on  several  of  ISO
subcommittees  in  order  to  better  position  itself  to  set  standards-setting  agendas  in
the future.

Europe: Domination of International Standards Bodies

Some  U.S.  companies  and  industries  are  very  alarmed  that  the  European  Union,
having  harmonized  most  of  its  technical  standards  among  its  membership,  has  ex-
hibited  a  tendency  to  vote  as  a  bloc  at  international  standards  meetings.  With  15–
25  votes,  the  EU  can  exercise  significant  influence  in  the  100-member  ISO.  More
broadly,  U.S.  companies  that  are  active  in  international  standards  are  concerned
that the U.S. commitment to and consistency of participation in international stand-
ards  processes  is  not  as  great  as  that  practiced  by  the  Europeans,  and  the  lack  of
a  coherent  strategy  to  guide  U.S.  participation  is  impeding  the  U.S.  ability  to  act
forcefully in the standards arena.

Europe: Standards Aid to Developing Countries

In  contrast  to  China,  the  European  Union  has  adopted  a  very  outward-looking,
export-oriented standards strategy which is geared towards developing new markets
for EU-made goods. In addition to using its national standards as barriers to foreign
imports,  the  EU  is  actively  promoting  its  standards  among  developing  countries  as
a way to give an advantage to EU-made goods. U.S. manufacturers are worried be-
cause the European Commission has an explicit policy on this issue, provides signifi-
cant  financial  support  for  these  efforts,  and  sends  European  delegations  to  devel-
oping countries to help them launch their own standards initiatives, based on Euro-
pean standards and the European system of standards development, which is a gov-
ernment-run and supported process.

U.S.  companies  warn  that,  because  the  U.S.  has  not  been  actively  promoting  its
more  de-centralized  standards  system  in  the  emerging  markets  of  developing  coun-
tries, these governments are unfamiliar and thus less comfortable with that concept.
As a result, they are less apt to adopt the U.S. model, even though it is less bureau-
cratic,  more  flexible,  and  more  market-oriented.  The  U.S.  system  uses  an  open  and
transparent  process  that  solicits  the  opinion  and  permits  the  direct  participation  of
all  interested  firms  and  other  entities.  Instead,  these  countries  adopt  centralized,
government-controlled  standards  development  systems  that  are  more  likely  to  take

an  active,  interventionist  role  in  creating  standards  specifically  designed  to  protect
domestic  industries.  When  they  do  adopt  foreign  standards,  these  governments  are
more likely to adopt a European standard over a U.S. one.
How Can the U.S. Respond?

Standards  experts  argue  that  the  U.S.  must  take  a  more  active  role  in  the  inter-
national  standards  arena  and  take  steps  to  increase  its  support  for  domestic  and
international  standards  development,  negotiation,  and  technical  assistance.  There
are  several  basic  ways  in  which  the  U.S.  Government  or  U.S.  companies  could  re-
duce the use of standards as trade barriers to U.S. products:
• National Standards Strategy

The  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)  is  developing  a  U.S.  Stand-
ards  Strategy  document  in  collaboration  with  its  membership,  independent  stand-
ards consortia, and federal agencies, particularly the Department of Commerce. This
document,  currently  in  draft  form,  contains  a  number  of  recommendations  on  what
steps  ought  to  be  taken  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  standards-related  trade  barriers.
This document emphasizes that the current system of standards development in the
U.S.  works  well,  but  that  government  (both  State  and  Federal)  and  industry  must
work  together  in  a  more  coordinated  fashion  and  commit  more  resources  to  ensure
that  the  system  is  adequately  supported.  The  strategy  also  says  that  standards
should be developed in as fair and open a process as possible, and that the Federal
Government  should  work  with  its  counterparts  in  other  countries  to  prevent  stand-
ards from becoming trade barriers.
• Department of Commerce Standards Initiative and Report

In  2003,  the  Department  of  Commerce  launched  a  standards  initiative  to  bring
more  focus  and  resources  to  address  the  trade  barriers  problem.  The  Department
of  Commerce  in  2004  published  a  paper  entitled  ‘‘Standards  and  Competitiveness:
Coordinating  for  Results,’’  which  included  57  recommendations.  As  a  result,  some
efforts have been made within the Department of Commerce to ensure that different
agencies  that  are  involved  in  standards  coordinate  their  activities  and  share  infor-
mation,  most  notably  NIST  and  the  International  Trade  Administration  (ITA).  Ob-
servers have commented that more funding is needed to hire subject-matter experts
and place them in strategic locations around the world, and pay for standards train-
ing for existing trade officers. Furthermore, they note that the Department of State
and U.S. Trade Representative’s office and other agencies involved in trade need to
be brought into the process to address the issue most comprehensively.
• Standards Outreach to Trading Partners

Although the China–Wi-Fi case is cited as a victory by some, others say that this
incident should not become a model for how to resolve a standards conflict, because
the  incident  soured  relations  between  the  U.S.  and  China  in  the  standards  arena
at  a  time  when  standards  experts  say  the  U.S.  should  be  reaching  out  to  China.
U.S.  industry  groups  have  urged  the  U.S.  Government  to  work  on  improving  inter-
actions  with  China  in  the  standards  arena,  such  as  providing  technical  assistance
to  China  and  other  key  Asian  countries  to  help  them  meet  their  WTO  TBT  obliga-
tions.  Standards  development  organizations  point  out  that  the  standards  develop-
ment  environment  is  often  collegial  and  cooperative,  and  provides  many  opportuni-
ties  to  settle  technical  differences  before  they  manifest  themselves  in  standards
wars. ANSI and other participants in international standards negotiations say that
a substantial effort should be made by all U.S. participants in the standards devel-
opment  process  to  build  a  constructive  educational  dialogue  with  the  Chinese,  not
just  on  standards  themselves,  but  also  on  the  process  issues:  how  the  U.S.  method
of industry-driven standards development works, and what its advantages are.

To  counter  the  European  Union’s  outreach  to  developing  countries,  standards  ex-
perts recommend that the Federal Government and/or U.S. companies begin a simi-
lar  campaign  to  tout  the  benefits  of  the  U.S.-style  of  standards  development  in
emerging  markets  in  South  America  and  Southeast  Asia.  Industry  groups  such  as
the  National  Association  of  Manufacturers  warn  that  the  U.S.  has  a  significant
amount of catching up to do in this area, and should increase funding for technical
assistance  to  these  countries  through  such  agencies  as  the  U.S.  Agency  for  Inter-
national  Development  (USAID),  and  ensure  these  programs  are  promoting  U.S.,
rather than European standards and standards-development processes.
• Domestic Standards Awareness and Education

U.S.  industries,  the  Federal  Government,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  State  and  local
governments,  appear  to  be  developing  a  greater  awareness  of  the  importance  of
standards  in  international  trade,  and  their  significance  as  an  instrument  of  trade
policy. However, academics and industry experts together have pointed out that the

subject  of  standards  and  their  relevance  are  not  part  of  engineering  or  business
school  curricula,  and  therefore  are  not  ‘‘baked  in’’  to  the  fundamentals  of  running
a  business  or  designing  products.  These  experts  suggest  grant  programs  to  encour-
age  the  development  of  standards  curricula  for  use  in  business  and  engineering
schools,  as  well  as  a  broader  effort  to  encourage  these  institutions  to  incorporate
some  kind  of  standards  education  into  their  programs.  Greater  awareness  should
also  be  cultivated  within  companies,  particularly  small  and  medium-sized  enter-
prises that are not as exposed to international trade issues, but are increasingly be-
coming so.
• Standards Assistance to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises

Major  corporations  with  an  international  presence  are  usually  more  aware  of
standards  issues,  and  can  afford  to  hire  standards  experts  or  create  an  office  to
manage,  track,  and  participate  in  international  standards  processes.  Small  busi-
nesses, however, are generally not as knowledgeable about international trade, and
do not have the resources to hire experts and translators necessary to work through
the  complex  business  of  getting  their  products  certified  in  a  foreign  country.  The
ITA  has  begun  to  make  some  efforts  to  educate  its  own  staff,  particularly  the  For-
eign  Commercial  Service  (FCS),  on  the  standards  issues.  In  addition,  ITA  plans  to
place standards experts in several countries, including a standards liaison in Beijing
in the summer of 2005.
• Standards Infrastructure Support

European  Union  members  of  international  standards-setting  bodies,  and  increas-
ingly  China  and  other  Asian  countries,  provide  greater  levels  of  support  (funding,
logistics,  technical  resources,  etc.)  to  their  standards  representatives  than  does  the
U.S. Government. Frequently, many of the delegates sent to international standards
setting organizations by other countries are not only subject matter experts, but also
government  representatives.  The  U.S.  participants  in  these  processes  have  sug-
gested  that  more  resources  be  provided  by  the  U.S.  Government  for  technical  sup-
port  by  NIST,  whose  representatives  participate  extensively  in  international  nego-
tiations.  They  also  suggest  that  either  U.S.  companies  or  the  U.S.  Government
should  provide  funding  to  standards  development  organizations  and  ANSI  to  boost
representation in the international arena, since a more consistent and forceful U.S.
presence  at  the  standards  meetings  would  lead  to  international  standards  that  are
more in line with U.S. interests.

Additional Background:
How Does the U.S. Standards Development System Work?

Any standard is the product of a collaborative process. In the United States there
are hundreds of Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and Standards Con-
sortia.  They  are  known  collectively  as  Standards  Setting  Organization  (SSOs).  The
membership  of  SSOs  may  consist  of  companies,  federal  agencies,  non-profits,  and
other  participants.  SSOs  develop  and  adopt  standards  acceptable  to  their  members
through a consensus process.

The  traditional  U.S.  SDOs  support  themselves  by  selling  the  documents  con-
taining  the  standards  to  users.  Many  SDOs  represent  well-established  industries
that over the years have developed highly formal processes for the proposal, consid-
eration, and acceptance of standards.

‘‘Open  Standards’’  are  a  popular  way  of  developing  standards,  where  the  stand-
ards  are  developed  in  open  forums  and  made  available  on  a  royalty-free  basis  on
the  premise  that  the  more  inclusive  and  cost-free  the  standard,  the  wider  will  be
its  adoption.  This  method  of  developing  standards  is  particularly  common  in  the
Internet-related hardware and software industries.

‘‘Global  Standards’’  are  standards  that  are  uniform  around  the  world.  Internet
protocols,  for  example,  which  govern  how  information  is  organized  and  transmitted
through the Internet, are global standards, developed by the World Wide Web Con-
sortium, or W3C. Another example is the standardized dimensions for shipping con-
tainers. The field of global standards can be a contentious one, for a global standard
often compromises between existing standards, or requires abandoning many stand-
ards  for  a  single  one.  The  European  Union  has  extensive  experience  in  this  area
from harmonizing the standards of its members. Global standards are unusual, but
there  is  a  movement  to  try  to  develop  and  promote  them  because  of  their  conven-
ience and growing necessity in an increasingly interconnected world.
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

ANSI is a non-profit umbrella group for SDOs that accredits the standards devel-
opment  procedures  of  its  member  organizations,  helps  coordinate  standards  activi-

ties  in  the  U.S.,  provides  a  forum  for  its  members  to  discuss  standards  issues,  and
is the U.S. representative at two major international standards bodies: The ISO and
the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC).  ANSI’s  membership  includes
most of the major U.S. manufacturers, as well as universities, government agencies,
testing  laboratories,  and  other  entities.  About  two  hundred  SDOs  in  total  are  ac-
credited by ANSI.

Although it represents the U.S. in the ISO and other international groups, unlike
its  foreign  counterparts,  ANSI  is  a  non-governmental  entity.  Hence,  ANSI’s  role  as
a  coordinator  of  the  U.S.  is  similar  to,  but  not  exactly  the  same  as  the  role  that
foreign governments play in standards development abroad. In the U.S., the role of
the  government  is  largely  one  of  support,  providing  input  where  government  input
is  required,  and  providing  some  of  the  scientific  and  technical  expertise  and  re-
search that is needed for any effective standards regime, mostly through NIST, but
also through other federal agencies that relate to health and safety.
Testing Laboratories and Testing Procedures in Trade: Conformity Assessment

Companies  that  decide  to  manufacture  products  based  on  a  given  standard  have
to  show  that  their  products  are  compliant  with  it.  This  is  verified  by  having  their
products  tested  against  the  standard  at  a  testing  lab,  and  the  procedure  is  known
as  ‘‘conformity  assessment.’’  These  non-profit  and  for-profit  laboratories  test  prod-
ucts  to  ensure  that  they  meet  the  specifications  of  the  appropriate  standards  and
provide  verification  of  this  to  consumers  and  other  companies.  There  are  hundreds
of testing laboratories in the U.S. and thousands world-wide. The testing procedures
can also constitute trade barriers through the imposition of lengthy and complicated
requirements  for  foreign  manufacturers.  For  example,  China  has  instituted  the
China  Compulsory  Certification  Mark,  which  requires  companies  exporting  in  a
wide  range  of  categories  to  have  their  products  tested  first.  Often,  national  stand-
ards  require  that  the  tests  be  performed  in  the  laboratories  of  the  country  in  ques-
tion,  in  some  cases  the  government-run  standards  laboratories  there.  This  is  also
a  cause  for  concern  to  U.S.  companies  that  fear  possibility  of  having  their  intellec-
tual property stolen during the testing process.

As markets have become more global and more companies sell their products out
of  their  home  countries,  nations  have  started  engaging  in  Mutual  Recognition
Agreements (MRAs) which allow testing laboratories in other countries to test prod-
ucts against foreign standards. The WTO TBT agreement includes language encour-
aging the use of MRAs to facilitate the testing process, but the use of MRAs world-
wide is not comprehensive.
How Are Standards Developed in Other Countries?

In  Europe  and  Asia,  the  system  of  standards  development  is  different  from  that
in the U.S. Although the standards development processes in other countries is still
a  collaboration  between  companies  and  other  groups,  the  government  play  a  much
more direct role. Governments provide secretariats to manage their domestic stand-
ards  development  processes,  publish  the  standards,  and  support  the  country  rep-
resentation at international standards meetings. Moreover, the standards developed
are  government-subsidized  and  are  provided  to  the  user  community  for  free.  This
makes  the  adoption  of  these  standards  more  attractive,  and  this  policy  is  being
pushed,  particularly  by  the  European  countries,  into  emerging  markets  which  may
not  necessarily  have  standards  of  their  own.  This  approach  to  standards  develop-
ment  is  more  top-down,  although  companies  still  participate  heavily  in  the  proc-
esses.
National Standards Strategies

In recognition of the importance of standards to their domestic economic develop-
ment and ability to penetrate markets abroad, several countries have developed and
published  national  standards  strategies  which  outline  how  they  will  promote  their
standards  in  the  global  trade  system.  They  believe  that  standards  are  an  effective
strategic  tool  in  the  world  trade  arena,  and  these  opinions  are  borne  out  in  these
standards strategies. Standards strategies are being developed to help focus the re-
sources and management of countries’ standards infrastructures as a way of extend-
ing specific standards regimes to emerging markets and thus ensure access to these
markets for their products.

These  governments  see  participation  in  international  standards  activities  as  a
way  to  promote  their  economic  interests.  Recently,  the  Europeans  have  been  pro-
moting  their  standards  development  system  in  other  countries  to  enable  access  to
these markets by European goods.

For example, the German Standardization Strategy states:

In  the  face  of  increasing  market  globalization  and  growing  competition,  the
international  standardization  system  needs  to  be  strengthened  as  the  basis  for
uniform regional and national standards. Alliances should be created to support
the  introduction  of  the  European  model. . .this  approach  could  effectively  pro-
mote  the  goals  of  German  industry  in  accessing  global  markets.  Given  the  im-
portance  of  establishing  German  industry  in  emerging  economies  and  in  the
markets  of  the  new  and  future  EU  member  states,  appropriate  action  must  be
taken  to  gain  an  early  market  presence.  A  vital  task  in  this  context  is  to  com-
municate  an  appreciation  of  the  benefits  of  the  European  standardization  sys-
tem and to offer assistance in its adoption.

Questions for the Witnesses:

Chairman EHLERS. Good afternoon, and welcome to today’s hear-
ing  entitled  ‘‘China,  Europe,  and  the  Use  of  Standards  as  Trade
Barriers: How Should the United States Respond?’’

I apologize for the delayed start. We are waiting for the Ranking
Member  to  arrive,  but  he  has  been  delayed,  and  so,  with  the  per-
mission of the staff, the Minority staff, we will begin.

I  also  want  to  apologize  ahead  of  time.  We  may  be  able  to  keep
things  rolling  here,  but  I  am  in  a  committee  that  is  having  votes
today,  and  they—I  was  told  they  desperately  need  my  vote,  even
though they don’t know how I am going to vote yet. Maybe if I cast
one wrong vote, they will send me back. But we have someone who
will be here in a bit to substitute for me in the event that that hap-
pens. If I get called for this vote before that happens, we will have
to recess momentarily while I go vote.

So I apologize ahead of time if that happens.
This hearing is an opportunity to examine some of the most seri-
ous  problems  facing  U.S.  companies  as  a  result  of  other  nations
using standards as trade barriers. We will also learn what the U.S.
Federal  Government,  U.S.  companies,  and  U.S.  standards-setting
organizations  can  do  to  reduce,  avoid,  or  eliminate  these  barriers.
A  standard  is  a  technical  specification  for  a  production,  process,
or service. Standards are used to assure uniformity and inter-oper-
ability. For example, standards make it possible for cellular phones
made  by  different  companies  to  communicate  with  each  other,  re-
gardless of location in the United States. But, because Europe and
many  other  nations  have  different  standards,  our  U.S.  cell  phones
generally  don’t  work  in  those  areas.  When  they  do,  it  is  generally
at considerable extra expense.

It is estimated that 80 percent of the total value of global trade,
$7.3 trillion in 2003, is affected by standards and related technical
regulations  and  testing  procedures.  Thus,  this  issue  has  enormous
implications for U.S. companies.

U.S.  companies  and  standards-setting  organizations  are  con-
cerned  that  our  trading  partners  are  using  technical  standards  as
trade barriers to U.S. products to protect their own domestic indus-
tries. This practice seems to be increasing as traditional tariff bar-
riers are being lowered.

A  recent  example  comes  from  China’s  attempt  last  year  to  use  a
different  standard  for  wireless  computer  chips,  which  would  have
required  all  companies  to  make  two  sets  of  chips:  one  for  China,
and  one  for  the  rest  of  the  world.  Fortunately,  the  U.S.  Govern-
ment was able to pressure China to back down. But China will con-
tinue  to  attempt  to  use  standards  to  favor  Chinese  manufacturers
to the detriment of U.S. companies.

This  hearing  will  help  us  to  better  understand  these  complex
problems  and  find  ways  to  help  U.S.  companies.  We  also  hope  it
will enable us to stave off any ‘‘standards wars.’’

We  will  also  learn  what  the  U.S.  Federal  Government,  U.S.  companies,  and  U.S.
standards-setting organizations can do to reduce, avoid, or eliminate these barriers.
A standard is a technical specification for a product, process, or service. Standards
are  used  to  ensure  uniformity  and  inter-operability.  For  example,  standards  make
it  possible  for  cellular  phones  made  by  different  companies  to  communicate  with
each  other  regardless  of  location  in  the  U.S.  But,  because  Europe  and  many  other
nations have different standards, our U.S. cell phones generally don’t work in those
areas. When they do, it is generally at considerable extra expense.

It  is  estimated  that  80  percent  of  the  total  value  of  global  trade  ($7.3  trillion  in
2003)  is  affected  by  standards  and  related  technical  regulations  and  testing  proce-
dures. Thus, this issue has enormous implications for U.S. companies.

U.S.  companies  and  standards-setting  organizations  are  concerned  that  our  trad-
ing partners are using technical standards as trade barriers to U.S. products to pro-
tect  their  own  domestic  industries.  This  practice  seems  to  be  increasing  as  tradi-
tional tariff barriers are being lowered.

A  recent  example  comes  from  China’s  attempt  last  year  to  use  a  different  stand-
ard  for  wireless  computer  chips,  which  would  have  required  all  companies  to  make
two  sets  of  chips,  one  for  China  and  one  for  the  rest  of  the  world.  Fortunately,  the

of U.S. companies.

This  hearing  will  help  us  to  better  understand  these  complex  problems  and  find
ways to help U.S. companies. We also hope it will enable us to stave off any ‘‘stand-
ards wars.’’

Chairman  EHLERS.  With  great  pleasure,  I  now  recognize  the
Ranking  Member,  the  gentleman  from  Oregon,  Mr.  Wu,  for  his
opening statement. Good timing.

Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Standards and timing are everything.
Good  afternoon,  and  I  want  to  join  Chairman  Ehlers  in  wel-

you all.

coming everyone to this afternoon’s hearing.

I  will  be  brief  in  my  remarks,  because  I  am  here  to  learn  from

While standards support the development of new technology and
form  the  basis  of  commerce,  their  role  and  importance  is  not  well
understood by either the general public or policy-makers. I welcome
the  opportunity  we  have  today  to  learn  more  about  the  role  of
standards in an increasingly global marketplace.

I  have  some  understanding  of  the  importance  of  standards  from
my  prior  experience  as  an  attorney  representing  high-tech  compa-
nies  in  international  trade  issues  in  both  India  and  China.  While
standards can support commerce, they can also be used as non-tar-
iff  barriers  to  trade  and  to  promote  one  technology  over  another.
We need to ensure that there is a level playing field to ensure that
standards are used to promote rather than hinder trade.

I  realize  that  we  can’t  force  other  countries  to  adopt  the  stand-
ards system that is used in the United States. However, we can en-
sure that the Federal Government is using its resources to support
U.S. standards, businesses, and industry.

What I hope to learn today is: How can the Federal Government
do  a  better  job  in  supporting  U.S.  standards  and  be  responsive  to
our  industry’s  concerns  about  standards  or  abuses  of  standards  by
other  countries  in  the  form  of  non-tariff  trade  barriers?  How  can
coordination among federal agencies dealing with standards be im-
proved? If countries violate standards provisions in the WTO, is the
Federal  Government  currently  sufficiently  vigorous  in  its  prosecu-
tion of these violations? And finally, how do the witnesses see U.S.

standards  development  organizations  evolving  over  the  next  five,
10, or 20 years?

I  applaud  the  development  of  a  National  Standards  Strategy
under  the  direction  of  the  American  National  Standards  Institute;
however,  I  want  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  actions  and
resources  required  for  its  implementation.  While  the  National
Standards  Strategy  lays  out  a  series  of  ambitious  goals,  we  need
to also lay out a plan on how to achieve these goals.

I  want  to  thank  our  witnesses  for  taking  the  time  to  appear  be-
fore the Subcommittee today, and I want to assure them that I con-
sider  today  to  be  the  first  step  in  a  continuing  dialogue  on  how  to
best improve the competitiveness of American industry.

I yield back to the Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Wu follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE DAVID WU

Good Afternoon and I want to join Chairman Ehlers in welcoming everyone to this

afternoon’s hearing.

I will be brief in my remarks, because we are really here to learn about the prob-

lems facing industry and what role the government can support them.

While  standards  support  the  development  of  new  technology  and  form  the  basis
of commerce, their role and importance is not well-understood by the public or most
policy-makers.  I  welcome  the  opportunity  we  have  today  to  learn  more  about  the
role of standards in an increasingly global marketplace.

I have some understanding the importance of standards from my prior experience
as  a  lawyer  representing  high-tech  companies  on  international  trade  issues  in  both
India  and  China.  While  standards  can  support  commerce,  they  can  also  be  used  as
barriers  to  trade  and  to  promote  one  technology  over  another.  We  need  to  ensure
that there is a level playing field to ensure that standards are used to promote trade
not hinder it.

I  realize  that  we  can’t  force  other  countries  to  adopt  the  standards  system  that
is used in the United States. However, we can ensure that the Federal Government
is using its resources to support U.S. standards and industry. What I hope to learn
today is:

• How can the U.S. Government a better job in supporting U.S. standards and
being responsive to industry’s concerns about standards abuses by other coun-
tries?

• How  can  coordination  among  federal  agencies  dealing  with  standards  issues

be improved?

• If  countries  violate  standards  provisions  in  the  WTO,  is  the  Federal  Govern-

ment vigorous in its prosecution of these violations?

• And  how  do  the  witnesses  see  U.S.  standards  development  organizations

evolving over the next five to ten years?

I  applaud  the  development  of  a  National  Standards  Strategy  under  the  direction
of  the  American  National  Standards  Institute,  however  I  want  to  gain  a  better  un-
derstanding of the actions and resources required for its implementation. While the
National  Standards  Strategies  lays  out  a  series  of  ambitious  goals,  we  need  to  also
lay out a plan on how to achieve these goals.

I  want  to  thank  our  witnesses  for  taking  the  time  to  appear  before  the  Sub-
committee today. And I want to assure them that I consider today to be a first step
in a dialogue on how best to improve the competitiveness of U.S. industry.

Chairman EHLERS. I thank the Ranking Member.

The first person is Dr. Hratch Semerjian. He is the Acting Direc-
tor  of  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  better
known as NIST. Next is Mr. Robert Noth. He is the Manger of En-
gineering  Standards  for  Deere  and  Company,  ‘‘Nothing  runs  like  a
Deere,’’  headquartered  in  Moline,  Illinois.  And  I  grew  up  to  the—
as  I  told  him  earlier,  I  grew  up  to  the  sounds  of  the  putt-putt  of
the  two-cylinder  John  Deere  tractor,  which  is  a  mainstay  in  the
community  where  I  grew  up.  Third  is  Dr.  Don  Deutsch.  He  is  the
Vice President for Standards Strategy and Architecture for Oracle,

I am pleased to call on Dr. Semerjian.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  HRATCH  G.  SEMERJIAN,  ACTING  DIREC-
TOR,  NATIONAL  INSTITUTE  OF  STANDARDS  AND  TECH-
NOLOGY
Dr. SEMERJIAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Wu.  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  today  on  the  topic  of
the role of standards in international competitiveness.

We  need  to  take  seriously  the  challenges  posed  by  the  growing
impact  of  standards  on  market  access,  so  that  we  can  better  posi-
tion  the  United  States  and  the  U.S.  companies  to  compete  in  the
global  market.  There  is  much  work  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  the
U.S.  standards  interests  have  fair  opportunity  to  be  reflected  in
standards  used  globally  and  that  these  interests  are  more  effec-
tively promoted in our most important markets, such as China.

The  decentralized  private  sector  demand-driven  U.S.  standards
system  has  many  strengths.  U.S.  companies  derive  significant  ad-
vantage  from  the  system’s  flexibility  and  responsiveness.  The  gov-
ernment also derives great benefit, both as a customer and user of
standards.

The  system  serves  the  country  well,  but  there  is  room  for  im-
provement.  In  particular,  the  growing  importance  of  standards  to
international competitiveness dictates that the United States, both
private and public sectors, move quickly to strengthen the interface
between  the  U.S.  standards  system  and  the  international  system.
This need was pointed out clearly two years ago by industry in re-
sponse to questions by the Department as our Standards Initiative,
launched  by  then-Secretary  Donald  Evans.  The  Standards  Initia-
tive  was  bolstered  last  year  with  a  comprehensive  report  on
‘‘Standards  and  Competitiveness:  Coordinating  for  Results,’’  which
contains  some  50  recommendations  for  moving  forward,  including

intensifying  Departmental  efforts  in  China  and  in  collaboration
with the private sectors in international standards organizations.

The  Department’s  May  2004  report  also  noted  the  importance  of
Department  representatives  participating  in  the  revision  of  the
U.S. Standards Strategy. NIST is an active participant in the work
being  done  by  ANSI  and  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  Committee
to  pull  together  a  diverse  set  of  stakeholders  to  update  and  revise
this strategy.

In  the  United  States,  standards  are  typically  developed  in  re-
sponse  to  specific  concerns  and  constituent  issues  expressed  by
both industry and government. Department agency supports stand-
ards  through  direct  participation  in  standards  development  activi-
ties  of  ANSI  and  standards-developing  organizations.  More  than
3,200  staff  from  26  federal  agencies  participate  in  private  sector
standards  development  activity.  Government  agencies  are  also
major  users  of  some  13,000  standards.  Both  the  U.S.  Government
and  private  sector  participate  in  international  standards  develop-
ment  in  numerous  venues.  We  need  to  make  effective  use  of  our
participation  in  each  of  these  venues  to  ensure  that  U.S.  interests
are advanced.

NIST has a variety of roles in the U.S. standards system. We are
frequently  looked  to  for  research  and  measurements  that  provide
the technical underpinning for standards. NIST is tasked with pro-
moting  the  efficiency  of  the  U.S.  standards  system  by  coordinating
federal  agency  use  of  non-government  standards  and  participating
in  the  development  of  relevant  standards  and  through  promoting
coordination  between  the  public  and  private  sector  in  both  the
standards and conformity assessment arenas.

NIST  is  also  directed  by  law  to  develop  specific  standards,  cryp-
tographic  standards  and  applications  for  federal  IT  security,  bio-
metric,  and  voting  system  standards,  and  to  help  industry  develop
enterprise integration standards.

By  the  way,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  will  pleased  to  know  that  NIST
and  the  Technical  Guidelines  Development  Committee,  submitted
the initial set of voluntary voting system guidelines to the Election
Assistance Commission last Monday in timely compliance with the
legislation.

NIST’s  technical  programs  support  global  recognition  of  U.S.
standards.  These  programs  take  advantage  of  synergies  with  re-
lated Department of Commerce programs and with the private sec-
tors  and  are  critical  to  U.S.  manufacturers’  access  to  export  mar-
kets.  They  include  our  Standards  and  Trade  Workshop  program,
maintaining good working relationships with foreign standards offi-
cials,  leadership  in  key  standards-development  activities  that  im-
pact trade, and notifying U.S. exporters of proposed technical regu-
lation standards in key foreign markets.

NIST’s  fiscal  year  2006  budget  proposal  addresses  the  need
pointed out by the Committee to strengthen the scientific and tech-
nical infrastructure needed to support the U.S. standards base. The
proposal  supports  advances  in  manufacturing,  combining  activities
to  help  U.S.  manufacturers  meet  measurement,  integration,  and
international standards challenges. It includes activities relating to
standards for manufacturing enterprise integration, nano-manufac-
turing, and expanding access to global markets.

In fact, to understand the global standards arena fully, you need
to consider not only documentary standards, but also measurement
standards. Manufacturing and measuring are two sides of the same
coin. If you can’t measure, you can’t manufacture. And if you can’t
assure  those  measurements  to  other  companies  and  consumers,
here and abroad, you probably will lose them to competitors.

So  I  am  very  pleased  to  announce  today  that  NIST  is  launching
a  comprehensive  effort  to  roadmap  America’s  measurement  needs.
The Nation’s measurement system is a vital element of our innova-
tion  infrastructure.  The  goal  of  this  very  important  initiative  is  to
ensure  that  the  Nation’s  highest  priority  measurement  needs  are
identified  and  met.  The  initiative  recognizes  the  growing  impor-
tance  of  both  the  international  measurement  system  and  its  inter-
section with international standards.

In  summary,  we  recognize  the  global  challenges  posed  to  U.S.
competitiveness  in  both  the  documentary  and  measurement  stand-
ards  arenas.  Now,  more  than  ever,  in  an  environment  of  increas-
ingly  scarce  resources  and  many  competing  demands,  we  need  to
create  and  implement  mechanisms  that  will  enable  the  public  and
private  sectors  to  make  informed  choices  about  how  best  to  invest
resources to achieve the greatest impact. NIST is committed to the
success of this effort.

Thank  you,  again,  for  providing  a  forum  for  discussion  of  these

important issues for the U.S. economy.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Semerjian follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF HRATCH G. SEMERJIAN

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to
testify  today  on  the  topic  of  the  role  of  standards  in  international  competitiveness.
Standards  impact  an  estimated  80  percent  of  world  trade  and  are  a  significant  fac-
tor  in  competitiveness  worldwide.  We  need  to  take  seriously  the  challenges  posed
by the growing impact of standards on market access so that we can better position
the  United  States  and  U.S.  companies  to  compete  in  the  global  market.  There  is
much work to be done to ensure that U.S. standards interests have fair opportunity
to  be  reflected  in  standards  used  globally  and  that  these  interests  are  more  effec-
tively  promoted  in  our  most  important  markets,  such  as  China.  This  need  has  be-
come more real and apparent as more countries become active in the global market
and the global standards arena.

To understand the global standards arena, you need to look at two types of stand-
ards—measurement  standards  and  documentary  standards.  Measurement  stand-
ards, which are the technical forte of the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology,  are  generic  tools  that  are  widely  used  by  industry  to  support  efficiency  in
the marketplace. These measurements are vital to international trade. For example,
the  way  that  I  measure  electromagnetic  compatibility  (EMC)  or  flow  rates  may  not
be the same way that a European or Chinese lab measures EMC or flow rates. Dif-
ferences  in  measurements  and  lack  of  equivalency  among  national  measurement
systems can delay, and sometimes block, entry into foreign markets.

Documentary  standards—standards  embodied  in  written  documents  and  promul-
gated  by  Standards  Development  Organizations  (SDOs)—establish  the  fitness  of  a
product  for  a  particular  use.  These  standards  may  address  product  features,  per-
formance,  quality,  compatibility,  or  other  product  attributes.  Examples  include  the
dimensions of lumber, rules for the construction and operation of steam boilers and
pressure  vessels,  and  specifications  for  film  speed.  There  also  are  documentary
standards  that  set  specifications  for  the  function  and  operation  of  a  device  or  sys-
tem,  covering  everything  from  elevators  and  refrigerators  to  handicapped  access.
There  are  thousands  upon  thousands  of  standards  like  these  that  are  invisible  to
most consumers but play a vital role in facilitating global trade.

The  United  States  is  a  demand-driven,  highly  diversified  economy  and  society,
and  its  standards  system  reflects  this  framework.  Our  decentralized,  sector-  and
technology-based standards system is diverse and inclusive. The system is based on
a  strong  private-public  partnership.  In  the  United  States,  standards  are  typically

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

16

developed  in  response  to  specific  concerns  and  constituent  issues  expressed  by  both
industry  and  government.  This  demand-driven  approach  contrasts  with  that  of
many of our trading partners, who favor a much more top-down, government-driven
approach.

The  U.S.  standards  system  is  highly  decentralized  and  naturally  partitioned  for
most  applications  into  industrial  sectors  that  are  supported  by  numerous  inde-
pendent,  private-sector  standards  development  organizations  (SDOs)—currently
more than 450 such organizations, with at least 150 more consortia standards devel-
opment  activities  underway.  Approximately  20  SDOs  develop  about  80  percent  of
standards in the United States.

Without  any  central  authority  or  direction  from  government,  a  wide  variety  of
U.S.  voluntary  standards  activities  have  proceeded  very  successfully  along  sector-
specific  lines  for  over  a  century.  Although  U.S.  decisions  about  standards  authority
and responsibilities were not made deliberately with a view to providing support for
U.S.  efforts  in  international  trade,  they  work  well  to  support  the  domestic  goals  of
protection of health, safety and the environment as well as specification of products,
processes and systems.

The  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI),  a  private  sector,  non-profit
organization  founded  in  1918  by  several  SDOs  and  U.S.  Government  representa-
tives,  including  the  Department  of  Commerce,  functions  as  a  central  clearinghouse
and  coordinating  body  for  its  member  organizations,  which  in  turn  develop  stand-
ards  on  a  decentralized,  consensus  basis.  ANSI  is  composed  of  more  than  700  com-
pany members; 30 government agencies; 20 institutions; and 260 professional, tech-
nical, trade, labor and commercial organizations.

Government agencies support standards through direct participation in standards
development,  as  well  as  through  participation  in  policy  activities  of  ANSI  and  spe-
cific standards developing organizations in which they have a direct interest. Many
agencies are active participants in standards development, at both the national and
international  levels.  This  participation  is  encouraged  by  both  law  and  policy.  More
than  3200  staff  from  26  federal  agencies  participate  in  private  sector  standards  de-
velopment  activities.  At  NIST,  there  are  more  than  350  participants,  more  than  a
quarter of our technical staff.

Government  agencies  are  also  major  users  of  standards,  to  support  regulation  of
health,  safety,  and  the  environment,  as  well  as  for  procurement  of  products  and
services  for  federal  use.  We  currently  count  more  than  13,000  private  sector  stand-
ards in use by the Federal Government. This substantial federal agency reliance on
private  sector  standards  reinforces  the  importance  of  globally  recognized  standards
that facilitate the seamless flow of products and services across borders.

Both  the  U.S.  Government  and  private  sector  participate  in  international  stand-
ards  development  in  a  variety  of  ways:  through  private,  voluntary  organizations
whose  membership  is  on  a  national  body  basis;  through  treaty  organizations  (gov-
ernments  are  members);  through  professional  and  technical  organizations  whose
membership  is  on  an  individual  or  organizational  basis;  and  through  consortia,
whose membership is typically company and industry-based. We need to make effec-
tive  use  of  our  participation  in  each  of  these  venues  to  ensure  that  U.S.  interests
are advanced.

Our  decentralized,  private  sector  and  demand-driven  U.S.  standards  system  has
many  strengths.  U.S.  companies  derive  significant  advantage  from  the  system’s
flexibility  and  responsiveness.  The  government  also  derives  great  benefit  from  the
system, both as a customer and user of standards. Government agencies play an im-
portant  role  in  the  U.S.  standards  system  as  advocates  for  the  national  interest,
both here at home and globally.

The  system  serves  the  country  well,  but  there  is  room  for  improvement.  In  par-
ticular,  the  growing  importance  of  standards  to  international  competitiveness  dic-
tates  that  the  United  States—both  private  and  public  sectors—move  quickly  to
strengthen  the  interface  between  the  U.S.  standards  system  and  the  international
system.  This  need  was  pointed  out  clearly  two  years  ago  by  industry  in  response
to  questions  posed  by  the  Department  of  Commerce  as  part  of  its  Standards  Initia-
tive.

The Department of Commerce’s Standards Initiative was launched in March 2003
by  then-Secretary  Donald  Evans  specifically  to  address  U.S.  industry  concerns  that
issues relating to standards and assessment of conformity to those standards in for-
eign  markets  were  among  the  greatest  barriers  to  expanding  exports.  U.S.  busi-
nesses  want  a  fair  and  equitable  standards  playing  field  and  Secretary  Evans  di-
rected  the  Department  to  assist  them  in  achieving  that  balance  where  standards
would  ideally  be  judged  not  only  on  their  technical  merits  but  also  on  their  devel-
opers’  adherence  to  the  principles  of  openness,  transparency,  balance  or  interests,
due  process  and  consensus.  The  Secretary’s  Standards  Initiative  was  bolstered  last

year  with  a  comprehensive  report  on  Standards  and  Competitiveness:  Coordinating
for  Results,  which  contains  some  50  recommendations  for  moving  forward.  These
recommendations  respond  in  part  to  specific  industry  requests  to  the  Department
for action in key areas.

Examples  of  industry  requests  of  the  Department  on  standards  issues  include  a
desire  for  the  Department  to  focus  on  China  as  the  primary  market  where  the
United  States  should  attempt  to  influence  standards  development  and  trade  policy
relating  to  standards;  counter  the  aggressive  promotion  of  European  standards
throughout the world; limit the potential for EU block voting on standards in inter-
national standards development organizations; increase pressure on countries to im-
plement their World Trade Organization (WTO) or Free Trade Agreement (FTA) ob-
ligations; and coordinating more closely interagency on standards issues.

In close collaboration with industry, the Department is pursuing an active multi-
pronged strategy with respect to standards-related issues in China. This strategy in-
cludes continued engagement at the policy and technical levels to deal with specific
issues  as  they  arise,  providing  grant  support  where  appropriate  to  U.S.  standards
developing organizations to open offices in China, posting a standards attache´ to the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing this summer, and sponsoring an ongoing series of both gen-
eral and sector-specific workshops involving Chinese officials and relevant U.S. pri-
vate  and  public  sector  interests.  Regarding  the  issue  of  EU  influence  in  standards
on  the  international  level,  the  Department  is  working  with  ANSI  and  industry  to
define  and  address  these  concerns  at  the  policy  level  and  also  on  a  case-by-case
basis.

The Department’s May 2004 report also noted the importance of Department rep-
resentatives participating in the revision of the U.S. Standards Strategy, which was
first  created  in  2000  under  the  auspices  of  ANSI.  The  purpose  of  the  strategy  is  to
strengthen  the  U.S.  standards  system  and  to  establish  a  framework  for  achieving
goals related to both the competitiveness of U.S. industry and achieving a balanced
global trading system. ANSI initiated the first effort to develop a national standards
strategy  in  1998,  in  response  to  a  challenge  from  Ray  Kammer,  then  Director  of
NIST. The strategy was published in August 2000.

The Strategy, currently under revision to reflect the new global environment, pro-
vides  an  excellent  framework  for  strengthening  the  interface  between  the  U.S.
standards system and the international system. The purpose of a standards strategy
for the United States is to establish a framework that can be used by all interested
parties to further advance trade issues in the global marketplace, enhance consumer
health  and  safety,  meet  stakeholder  needs  and,  as  appropriate,  advance  U.S.  view-
points  in  the  regional  and  international  arena.  The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  pro-
vides both a statement of the purpose and ideals that underlie the U.S. system and
a  vision  for  the  future  of  the  U.S.  standards  system  in  a  more  globally  competitive
economy.

The  revised  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  is  being  developed  in  an  open,  balanced,
transparent  and  participatory  process.  More  than  100  representatives  of  industry;
small,  medium  and  large  enterprise;  standards  developers  and  consortia;  consumer
groups;  and  Federal  and  State  governments  have  participated  in  the  development
and  review  process.  The  Strategy  highlights  key  strategic  imperatives  that  will
maximize  the  strengths  of  the  U.S.  system  and  minimize  weaknesses.  NIST  ,  and
the  Department  as  a  whole,  are  strong  supporters  of  the  work  being  done  by  the
American National Standards Institute and the U.S. Standards Strategy Committee
to  pull  together  a  diverse  set  of  stakeholders  in  the  future  of  the  U.S.  standards
system to update and revise the strategy.

A  sectoral  approach  recognizes  that  there  is  no  simple  prescription  that  can  be
handed  down  to  fit  all  needs.  Sectors  must  develop  their  own  plans;  the  purpose  of
the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  is  to  provide  guidance  and  coherence  without  con-
straining creativity or effectiveness. The Strategy consists of a set of strategic initia-
tives  having  broad  applicability  which  will  be  applied  according  to  their  relevance
and  importance  to  particular  sectors.  Stakeholders  are  encouraged  to  develop  their
own  tactical  initiatives  where  needed  and  this  strategy  suggests  some  which  have
widespread applicability.

The Strategy addresses opportunities for improvement in getting the message out
about the principles and policies that both underlie the U.S. system and are key to
the development of globally relevant standards, whatever venue stakeholders choose
for  their  work.  The  Department  will  work  closely  with  key  players  in  the  U.S.  sys-
tem  to  implement  relevant  elements  of  the  Strategy.  We  will  also  continue  our
strong partnership with ANSI to support its role of coordination of the U.S. system
and  as  member  body  of  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)
and  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission.  U.S.  membership  in  the  IEC  is
coordinated by the U.S. National Committee to the IEC, through ANSI.

NIST  has  a  variety  of  roles  in  the  U.S.  standards  system.  As  the  national  meas-
urement institute, NIST is frequently looked to for research and measurements that
provide the technical underpinning for standards, ranging from materials test meth-
ods to standards for building performance, and for a range of technologies, from in-
formation and communications technologies to nano- and biotechnologies. Under the
provisions of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act and OMB Cir-
cular A–119, NIST is tasked with promoting the efficiency of the U.S. standards sys-
tem, by coordinating federal agency use of non-government standards and participa-
tion  in  the  development  of  relevant  standards,  and  through  promoting  coordination
between the public and private sectors in both the standards and conformity assess-
ment arenas.

NIST  is  also  directed  by  law  to  develop  specific  standards—cryptographic  stand-
ards  and  applications,  as  well  as  guidelines,  procedures  and  best  practices  for  Fed-
eral  IT  security;  biometric  and  voting  system  standards—and  to  help  industry  de-
velop enterprise integration standards.

NIST technical programs support global recognition of U.S. standards, where rel-
evant,  as  well  as  harmonization  of  standards  to  avoid  barriers  to  trade.  These  pro-
grams  take  advantage  of  synergies  with  related  Department  of  Commerce  trade-re-
lated  programs  and  with  the  private  sector,  and  are  critical  to  U.S.  manufacturers’
access to export markets. Two key outcomes of these programs are an expanded net-
work  of  foreign  officials  knowledgeable  about  the  U.S.  system,  and  wider  use  and
acceptance  by  foreign  governments  of  U.S.  products  and  standards  that  incorporate
U.S. technology.

NIST’s proposed FY06 initiative on standards in support of global trade addresses
specific  needs  of  U.S.  businesses  seeking  to  compete  successfully  in  global  markets.
The  initiative  supports  U.S.  competitiveness  by  ensuring  that  innovative  U.S.  busi-
nesses  are  equipped  to  satisfy  global  as  well  as  U.S.  measurement  and  standards
requirements,  thus  enabling  rapid  response  to  changes  in  technologies  and  early
identification  of  new  and  non-traditional  measurement  and  standards  needs.  Spe-
cific activities include targeted measurement inter-comparisons with national meas-
urement institutes in key markets, leadership in key documentary standards devel-
opment activities in new technology areas, and expanded standards-related informa-
tion relevant to key markets.

With  this  year’s  National  Export  Strategy,  the  U.S.  Government  is  also  making
improvements  on  the  trade  promotion  front.  U.S.  Government  agencies,  led  by  the
Secretary  of  Commerce  under  the  Trade  Promotion  Coordinating  Committee
(TPCC),  are  collaborating  to  improve  the  government’s  standards-related  trade  pro-
motion efforts. We are currently developing a strategy through which we can—work-
ing  with  the  private  sector—do  a  better  job  of  promoting  U.S.  standards  interests
in our most important markets, such as China.

We  intend  to  partner  with  U.S.  industry  and  standards  developers  to  more  effec-
tively promote the virtues of an open, transparent and impartial approach to stand-
ards development and implementation. Both U.S. standards interests and policy ob-
jectives will be served when the governments of our most important export markets
are  convinced  of  the  strengths  of  this  approach  versus  alternatives  that  are  less
open and transparent, and more subjective.

We  recognize  that  the  government  and  private  sector  must  each  leverage  our
scarce resources. The TPCC strategy endeavors to develop an ambitious partnership
with U.S. manufacturers and service providers, and the U.S. standards community,
to better promote U.S. standards interests in our most important markets.

NIST  plays  a  major  role  in  maintaining  the  measurement  infrastructure  nec-
essary to advance U.S. interests in international trade, commerce and regulatory af-
fairs.  Manufacturing  and  measuring  are  two  sides  of  the  same  coin.  If  you  can’t
measure,  you  can’t  manufacture,  at  least  not  up  to  the  expectations  of  increasingly
demanding customers. And if you can’t assure those measurements to other compa-
nies  and  consumers  here  and  abroad,  you  probably  will  lose  them  to  competitors.
So I am very pleased to announce today that the National Institute of Standards
and Technology is launching a comprehensive effort to roadmap America’s measure-
ment needs. The Nation’s measurement system is a vital element of our innovation
infrastructure. The goal of this very important initiative—which will be undertaken
in  close  cooperation  with  the  private  sector  and  other  agencies—is  to  ensure  that
the Nation’s highest priority measurement needs are identified and then met. Work-
ing  with  others,  NIST  will  develop  and  publish  a  U.S.  Measurement  System  road-
map  on  a  regular  basis.  We  will  report  to  our  customers  and  stakeholders  on  what
needs  to  be  done  by  NIST—and  others—to  address  American’s  measurement  needs.
NIST will hold workshops in specific areas and encourage others to also hold work-
shops  to  identify  priority  needs.  NIST  then  will  sponsor  a  summit  in  January  2005
to focus discussions on how to meet those needs. We need to be certain that the U.S.

measurement system is robust so that it can sustain America’s economy and citizens
at  world-class  levels  in  the  21st  century.  The  initiative  recognizes  the  growing  im-
portance  of  both  international  measurement  system  and  its  intersection  with  inter-
national standards.

We recognize the global challenges posed to U.S. competitiveness, in both the doc-
umentary and measurement standards arenas. Now more than ever, in an environ-
ment of increasingly scarce resources and many competing demands, we need to cre-
ate and implement mechanisms that will enable both the public and private sectors
to make informed choices about how best to invest resources to achieve the greatest
impact. Together, stakeholders in the U.S. standards system are collaborating to lay
out a comprehensive strategic approach, implemented through effective private-pub-
lic partnership, to better position the United States and U.S. companies to compete
in  the  global  market.  Progress  will  require  communication,  cooperation,  planning,
and a commitment to action. NIST is committed to the success of this effort. Thank
you for allowing me to testify today, and I would be happy to answer any questions.

STATEMENT OF MR. ROBERT W. NOTH, MANAGER,
ENGINEERING STANDARDS, DEERE AND COMPANY

Mr. NOTH. Good afternoon.
Chairman EHLERS. Turn on your microphone, please.
Mr. NOTH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My  name  is  Bob  Noth,  and  I  am  the  Manager  of  Engineering
Standards  for  Deere  and  Company.  I  have  been  involved  with
standards now for about 15 years, so I have a little experience.

For those of you who may not know us, we are a U.S.-based man-
ufacturer of machinery and equipment for the ag and construction,
forestry  and  turf  care  commercial  markets,  and  our  products  are
sold  in  160  countries  around  the  world  currently,  and  we  have
more than 50 manufacturing operations located in 17 countries.

Chairman  EHLERS.  Excuse  me.  We  will  have  to  go  into  recess

briefly, and I will be back as soon as I can.

[Recess.]
Chairman  EHLERS.  I  apologize  to  everyone,  including—especially
Mr.  Noth,  for  interrupting  the  proceedings,  but  my  presence  was
demanded  elsewhere.  And  since  we  did  not  have  an  alternative
Chair, I had little choice.

You may proceed, Mr. Noth.
Mr. NOTH. Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman.
As I was just concluding, we consider it an honor and a privilege

to share our experiences regarding standards today.

John  Deere  products,  and  those  of  our  competitors  in  the  mar-
kets  we  serve,  are  not  heavily  regulated  compared  to  some  other
products  in  other  industries.  Active  participation  in  the  develop-
ment of and compliance with voluntary standards has been a long-
standing John Deere, and in fact, off-highway industry practice. We
involve  John  Deere  employees  as  subject  matter  experts  on  rel-
evant  standards  committees  in  the  markets  we  serve.  We  have
been  involved  in  Europe  since  the  1960s,  and  the  level  of  engage-
ment  has  escalated  significantly  since  1992  to  keep  pace  with
standards development for the European Common Market. We are
not  as  heavily  engaged  in  China,  but  we  anticipate  a  growing  in-
volvement  as  the  Chinese  market  develops  and  we  learn  our  ways
through the Chinese standards-development system.

This  has  worked  effectively  for  us,  but  we  do  have  concerns  for
the  future  based  on  recent  experience  and  anticipated  changes  in
the  global  market.  Specifically,  the  European  top-down,  all-encom-
passing  approach  to  regulation,  as  opposed  to  the  U.S.  approach,
which  is  based  more  on  addressing  specific  needs,  coupled  with
their  linking  of  regulatory  compliance  to  voluntary  standards
through  what  they  call  the  ‘‘presumption  of  conformity’’  and  the
‘‘best  available  technology’’  mindset  that  they  have  has  dramati-
cally increased regulatory coverage and voluntary standards devel-
opment  and  had  a  significant  increase  in  the  cost  of  delivering
product in the European market.

In  addition  to  that—excuse  me.  I  got  something  out  of  order.  I

The Europeans are aggressively exporting their system and their
standards  to  the  other  countries  and  developing  markets  around
the world. The EU itself and member-states are providing millions
of Euros in technical assistance in exchange for agreements to pre-
fer European-based standards, technology, and of course, European
producers.  Countries  like  Brazil,  Mexico,  Russia,  and  Israel  are
making such agreement, even when their markets show clear pref-
erences for U.S. goods and services.

Many  countries  within  the  WTO  and  signatories  to  the  TBT
agreement continue to be slow in implementation of the provisions
and  mechanisms  within  the  agreement.  This  includes  their  failure
to  recognize  standards  set  according  to  the  TBT  principles  as
‘‘international’’  and  thereby  creating  potential  problems  for  the  ac-
ceptance of U.S. goods exported into those markets.

And an even larger concern for our industry beyond the prolifera-
tion  of  country-unique  or  regionally-unique  standards  and  regu-
latory requirements is the issue of compliance, otherwise known as

am sorry.

Conformity  Assessment.  Most  countries  outside  the  U.S.  and  Eu-
rope  insist  on  conducting  their  own  assessments  of  conformity  be-
fore products can enter their markets. For our products and our in-
dustry, these requirements represent a huge redundant and unnec-
essary  cost  that  must  be  passed  on  to  the  consumer  with  no  addi-
tional value. Based on the methods employed by some countries, it
appears  that  some  of  these  requirements  are  more  motivated  by
technology transfer than by consumer protection.

The demand for John Deere products grows globally and the cost
of  configuring  products  to  unique  local  standards,  especially  those
required  by  governments  and  not  valued  by  the  consumers,  be-
comes  prohibitive  for  both  the  manufacturer  and  the  customers.
The need for globally-recognized and accepted standards that mini-
mize  the  need  for  unnecessary  expensive  product  variation  in-
creases. As a result, the off-highway equipment industry has gravi-
tated  to  the  development  of  a  portfolio  established  under  the  aus-
pices  of  the  International  Organization  of  Standards.  This,  of
course,  has  forced  some  changes  in  how  we  deal  with  our  Amer-
ican-based  standards-developing  organizations, 
like  SAE  and
ASAE,  and  over  the  past  few  years,  we  have  been  morphing  them
to  a  different  business  model  for  our  particular  standards  and
changed  some  of  the  funding  that  we  provide  in  order  for  them  to
provide the appropriate infrastructure. It also makes ANSI a more
strategic player for us, and that is why we have been engaged with
ANSI so aggressively.

The  off-highway  industry  prefers  the  ISO  process,  because  it  of-
fers  broad  political  acceptance  to  our  standards,  and  we  have  a
good argument for the international recognition of those standards
when  we  build  product  to  them.  We  can  have  a  seat  at  the  table,
and our delegation includes subject matter experts from our compa-
nies.  And  any  dependence  on  alternative  international  processes
leaves  the  door  open  for  competing  standards  to  be  developed  and
gain political acceptance in competition with the standards we may
be using.

The primary drawbacks, of course, are that the process—the U.S.
can  be  disadvantaged  by  the  ‘‘one  country-one  vote’’  principle  if
there  are  not  enough  ‘‘P’’  members,  or  participating  members,  at
the  table  to  represent  the  full  extent  of  the  global  market.  And
when  many  stakeholders  are  at  the  table,  of  course,  it  can  take
longer  to  reach  a  consensus  on  what  ultimately  becomes  a  stand-
ard, as you have to debate the issues.

However,  up  to  this  point,  we  feel  the  advantages  outweigh  the
disadvantages, and we know that the—that you can, in fact, by the
basis of early involvement, the quality input, and because we have
been  able  to  deliver  excellent  products  and  support  services  where
we do business, we have been successful in this process, not to say
we haven’t had setbacks.

However,  as  governments  that  control  access  to  markets  outside
of  the  developed  world  start  to  move  toward  more  regulation,
unique  and  sometimes  unjustified  standards  requirements  and  in-
sist  on  mandatory  but  redundant  testing,  regardless  of  brand  rec-
ognition  and  excellent  product  experience.  We  believe  better  com-
munication  between  the  private  sector  and  government  and  better
alignment  between  the  private  sectors  and  the  multiple  depart-

ments  and  agencies  of  government  is  essential  to  maintaining  a
level playing field for U.S.-based industry.

First  of  all,  the  Federal  and  State  governments  need  to  educate
themselves on issues relating to standards and trade, because, like
other  issues  before  Congress,  they  are  complex  and  will  not  yield
to  simple  fixes.  Hearings,  such  as  this  one  today  are  a  good  start,
and  John  Deere  applauds  the  Chairman’s  initiative  on  scheduling
it, but while one hearing is necessary, it is not sufficient, given the
magnitude of the challenge.

In this vein, we seriously urge Congress to consider endorsement
of the United States Standards Strategy that is currently being de-
veloped  by  a  large  cross-section  of  U.S.  industry,  standards-devel-
oping  organizations,  standards-developing  consortia,  government
agencies,  consumer  groups,  and  conformity  assessment  organiza-
tions  under  the  auspices  of  ANSI.  It  highlights  and  takes  advan-
tage  of  the  inherent  strengths  of  the  U.S.  standards  system  and
recommends activities that, if undertaken and executed effectively,
may neutralize much of what is currently perceived by some as the
disadvantage to U.S. interests.

Beyond  endorsing  the  strategy,  though,  we  believe  that  the  Fed-
eral  Government  also  needs  to  put  a  higher  priority—a  high  pri-
ority on providing technical assistance to our trading partners and
into  the  promotion  of  U.S.-based  standards  and  technology  as  an
alternative to the European approach.

We  believe  that  we  do  not  have  to  match  the  European  Union
dollar  for  Euro,  but  a  great  percentage  of  the  funding  currently
going  to  facilitating  development,  through  organizations 
like
USAID  or  the  Trade  Development  Agency,  should  be  allocated  to
technical  assistance  with  due  consideration  to  priorities  based  on
trading volumes and strategic relationships with our partners.

One  of  the  things  that  these  organizations  need  is  a  checklist
that  includes  standards-related  infrastructure  and  issues.  They
often  get  input  on  what  they  should  fund  based  on  in-country
input,  but  because  that  in-country  input  often  doesn’t  know  what
it  doesn’t  know,  we  need  something  that  ultimately  puts  some  pri-
ority on standards for our agencies.

Similarly,  we  need  consistent  and  predictable  funding  of  the
standards  and  trade  activities  in  the  Department  of  Commerce,
NIST,  the  International  Trade  Administration,  USTR,  and  the  De-
partment of State, Energy, and other agencies, but with the assur-
ance  that  more  effective  coordination  between  these  agencies  and
more  interaction  with  the  private  sector  occur.  The  existing  Inter-
agency  Council  on  Standards  needs  broader  participation  from
some  departments  and  agencies,  like  State.  What  is  missing,
though,  is  a  policy-level  council  responsible  for  coordination  at  a
strategic level. To this end, we respectfully suggest Congress might
consider  amending  the  National  Technology  Transfer  Act  of  1996
to put more emphasis on that policy-level communication, coordina-
tion,  and  alignment  with  consideration  of  creating  a  standards
‘‘czar’’ to provide appropriate accountability.

In 1992, we were very much where we are with China today, and
things have improved a great deal. We need to, I think, share that
we  use  the  lessons  learned  in  what  we  did  with  Europe  and  apply

the market changes.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Introduction

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT W. NOTH

Deere & Company is a U.S. based manufacturer of machinery and equipment for
the  agricultural,  construction,  forestry,  and  turf  care  commercial  markets.  John
Deere  products  are  currently  sold  in  160  countries  around  the  world  and  we  have
more  than  50  manufacturing  operations  located  in  17  countries  around  the  world.
We  consider  it  both  an  honor  and  privilege  to  share  our  experiences  regarding
standards and trade with this subcommittee here today.

We  have  been  asked  to  provide  testimony  addressing  questions  in  three  areas  of

interest:
1. What  has  been  the  experience  of  your  company  with  Chinese  and  European  tech-
nical  standards,  and  how  do  you  work  with  these  countries  in  this  area?  What
are  your  concerns  regarding  the  technical  standards  and  standards  practices  of
other countries?
John  Deere  products  and  those  of  our  competitors  in  the  markets  we  serve  have
not  been  heavily  regulated  compared  to  some  other  industries.  Active  participation
in  the  development  of  and  compliance  with  voluntary  standards  has  been  a  long
standing John Deere and in fact, industry practice. Primary reasons for this include:
• Demonstrating social responsibility by addressing health, safety and environ-
• Avoiding unnecessary regulation
• Managing risk regarding product liability
• Creating a supply base of affordable & readily available components
• Maintaining a level playing field for competition
• Documenting the ‘‘state-of-the-art’’

mental concerns regarding our products and their use.

To  these  ends,  we  have  involved  John  Deere  employees  who  are  ‘‘subject  matter
experts’’  on  relevant  standards  development  committees  in  the  markets  we  serve.
We’ve been involved in Europe since the 1960s and the level of our engagement has
escalated  significantly  since  1992  to  keep  pace  with  standards  development  for  the
European Common Market. We are not yet as heavily engaged in China but we an-
ticipate a growing involvement as the Chinese market develops.

Standards  are  a  form  of  product  specification  for  build  and  test.  The  cost  of  com-
pliance  is  reflected  in  the  market  price  for  our  products.  However,  as  the  demand
for  John  Deere  products  grows  globally,  the  cost  of  configuring  product  to  unique
local  standards,  especially  those  required  by  governments  but  not  the  consumers,
becomes prohibitive for both manufacturer and the customers. The need for globally
recognized  and  accepted  standards  that  minimize  the  need  for  unnecessary  and  ex-
pensive product variation increases. As a result, the off highway equipment industry
has  gravitated  to  the  development  of  a  portfolio  established  under  the  auspices  of
the International Organization for Standards (ISO).

This  ‘‘strategy’’  has  worked  effectively  for  us  up  to  now  but  we  do  have  concerns
for the future based on recent experience and anticipated changes in the global mar-
ket.

• In  establishing  the  Common  Market,  the  European  top  down,  all  encom-
passing  approach  to  regulation,  (as  opposed  the  U.S.  approach,  based  on  ad-
dressing  specific  needs)  coupled  with  linking  regulatory  compliance  to  vol-
untary  standards  through  the  ‘‘presumption  of  conformity’’  and  a  ‘‘best  avail-
able  technology’’  mindset  has  dramatically  increased  regulatory  coverage  and
voluntary standards development.
• The  European  approach  often  results  in  horizontal  type  standards  proposals
setting requirements on broad, dissimilar types of off highway equipment. Ex-
amples  include  Environmental  type  standards  (and  Regulations)  on  Engine
Emissions,  Fuels,  Environmental  Noise,  and  ‘‘End  of  Life’’  standards  that
place additional burdens on manufacturers. While we are not opposed to goals
and  objectives  of  some  of  these  initiatives,  we  have  concerns  that  some  pro-
posals  will  not  yield  the  desired  results  while  timetables  put  our  industry  at
risk of survival in terms of our abilities to recover the cost of the R&D invest-

ment  while  remaining  competitive  in  the  marketplace.  The  impacts,  already
being  felt,  are  substantially  higher  product  costs  to  the  consumer  with  little
direct  value  perceived  by  the  customer.  We  would  prefer  a  more  vertical,
product  oriented  approach  to  standards  and  regulation  so  the  solutions  can
be  more  effectively  tailored  to  product  use  and  more  effectively  deployed  in
global markets consistent with developing demand.
• The  Europeans  are  aggressively  exporting  their  system  and  their  standards
to  other  countries  and  developing  markets  around  the  world.  The  EU  itself
and individual member-states are providing millions of Euros in technical as-
sistance  in  exchange  for  agreements  to  prefer  European  based  standards,
technology  and  EU  producers.  Countries  like  Brazil,  Mexico,  Russia  and
Israel  are  making  such  agreements,  even  when  their  markets  show  a  clear
preference for U.S. goods and services.
• Many  of  the  governments  that  control  access  to  markets  outside  of  the  U.S.
are  skeptical  of  products  complying  with  ‘‘voluntary’’  standards,  no  matter
how  broadly  used,  accepted  and  successful.  Some  have  declared  their  inten-
tions  to  regulate  all  aspects  of  the  products  entering  their  markets.  In  some
cases,  even  products  built  to  internationally  recognized  and  accepted  stand-
ards from ISO or IEC are not immediately acceptable.
• Many  countries  within  the  WTO  and  signatories  to  the  TBT  agreement  con-
tinue  to  be  slow  to  implement  the  provisions  and  mechanisms  within  the
agreement. This includes their failure to recognize standards set according to
the  TBT  principles  as  ‘‘international’’  thereby  creating  potential  problems  for
the acceptance of U.S. goods exported to those markets.
• An  even  larger  concern  for  our  industry  beyond  the  proliferation  of  country
or  regionally  unique  standards  and  regulatory  requirements,  is  the  issue  of
compliance,  otherwise  known  as  Conformity  Assessment.  Most  countries  out-
side  the  U.S.  and  Europe  insist  upon  conducting  their  own  assessments  of
conformity before products can enter their markets. For our products and our
industry,  these  requirements  represent  a  huge  redundant  and  unnecessary
cost  that  must  be  passed  on  to  the  consumer  with  no  added  value.  Based
upon  the  methods  employed  by  some  countries,  it  appears  some  of  these  re-
quirements are more motivated by technology transfer than by consumer pro-
tection.

2. For your industry, how are standards developed in the U.S.? How is this different
from the way standards are developed in our major trading partners such as Eu-
rope  and  Asia?  What  are  the  merits  and  drawbacks  of  these  different  systems?  Is
the U.S. system at a disadvantage in the global standards arena, and if so, why?
The  primary  players  in  developing  standards  for  our  industry  include  our  trade
associations where we can legally collaborate with our competitors on needs for new
or  revised  standards  requirements.  For  Agricultural,  Construction  and  Forestry
equipment  we  work  through  the  Association  of  Equipment  Manufacturers  (AEM);
Turf  care  equipment,  the  Outdoor  Power  Equipment  Institute  (OPEI)  and  for  En-
gines,  the  Engine  Manufacturers  Association  (EMA).  Standards  proposals  are  then
worked  either  through  the  American  Society  of  Agricultural  Engineers  (ASAE)  for
Agricultural  and  Turf  care,  or  the  Society  of  Automotive  Engineers  (SAE)  for  Con-
struction,  Forestry  and  Engines  where  the  U.S.  Technical  Advisory  Groups  for  the
relevant  ISO  committees  are  administered.  The  U.S.  developed  proposals  and  posi-
tions are then introduced in their relevant ISO committees with the ultimate objec-
tive  of  obtaining  an  internationally  recognized  and  accepted  document  so  that  ma-
chines  made  to  comply  have  the  broadest  possible  market  access.  To  ensure  the
broadest  acceptability  of  U.S.  positions  we  also  encourage  our  U.S.  Trade  Associa-
tions  to  coordinate  with  European,  South  American  and  Asian  Trade  Associations
where  we  maintain  membership  and  ‘‘socialize’’  our  proposals  and  address  any  ex-
pressed concerns from the global stakeholders.

In  the  past,  ASAE  and  SAE  often  published  their  own  versions  of  Standards.  As
the  industry  has  become  more  globally  focused,  we  have  evolved  to  using  ISO  as

dundant documents. This has forced some changes in how the industry funds ASAE
and  SAE  for  executing  their  role  in  the  process  and  elevated  the  strategic  impor-
tance  of  ANSI  as  the  U.S.  member  body  of  ISO.  That  is  why  John  Deere  and  some
of our competitors are active participants in ANSI.

Because  of  our  industry  commitment  to  ISO,  the  differences  between  the  U.S.
process and those in other countries are not as great as they are for some other in-
dustry  sectors.  The  primary  difference  is  that  many  participants  in  ISO  Technical
Committees  are  not  ‘‘subject  matter  experts’’  who  have  a  working  knowledge  of  the

industry,  the  products  and  technologies,  but  are  National  Standards  Body  bureau-
crats or even government representatives who do not contribute to the technical de-
bate,  but  do  have  a  vote  in  the  final  outcome.  This  brings  an  element  of  inter-
national politics into the process that is often frustrating.

For  the  Off  Highway  Industry  the  ISO  process  is  preferred  to  the  national  or  re-

gional alternatives for the following reasons.

• It offers broad political acceptance of the standards.
• We can have a seat at the table and our delegation can include ‘‘subject mat-
• Any dependence on alternative ‘‘international’’ processes leaves the door open

ter experts.’’

for competing standards to be developed and gain political acceptance.

Compared to most U.S.-based standards developing organizations, National or Re-
gional  Standards  Bodies  are  more  closed  to  outside  participation,  less  transparent
regarding  what  is  being  considered  and  often  less  balanced  and  occasionally  biased
against  industry  participation.  Europe  is  now  somewhat  more  participative  and
open than it was in 1992 but still not up to U.S. expectations. China is just starting
to  emerge  as  a  significant  international  force  in  standards  but  at  this  point,  does
not appear to be quickly embracing open participation.

The primary drawbacks to the ISO process are:

• The  U.S.  can  be  disadvantaged  by  the  ‘‘one  country—one  vote’’  if  there  are
not enough ‘‘P’’ members at the table to represent the full extent of the global
market.
• When  many  stakeholders  are  at  the  table  it  can  take  longer  to  reach  con-

sensus.

Up to this point in time, John Deere does not believe our industry has been seri-
ously disadvantaged in the global standards arena because of our early involvement,
the  quality  of  our  input  and  because  we’ve  been  able  to  deliver  excellent  products
and  support  services  wherever  we  do  business.  We  have  not  often  seen  the  need  to
appeal  to  government  for  assistance,  preferring  instead  to  work  the  challenges  our-
selves.

However, as the governments that control access to markets outside of the devel-
oped world start to move toward more regulation, unique and sometimes unjustified
standards  requirements  and  insist  on  mandatory  but  redundant  testing  regardless
of  brand  recognition  or  excellent  product  experience,  we  believe  better  communica-
tion  between  the  private  sector  and  government  and  better  alignment  between  the
private  sectors  and  the  multiple  departments  and  agencies  of  government  is  essen-
tial to maintain a level playing field for U.S. based industry.
3. What  should  the  Federal  Government,  State  governments,  U.S.  standards-setting
organizations,  and  companies  be  doing  to  reduce  your  vulnerability  to  the  use  of
standards as trade barriers, and how could they promote the use of non-discrimi-
natory  standards  in  the  global  marketplace?  How  should  these  efforts  be  coordi-
nated?
First of all, the Federal and State governments need to educate themselves on the
issues relating to standards in trade because, like other issues before Congress, they
are  complex  and  will  not  yield  to  simple  fixes.  Hearings  such  as  this  one  today  are
a  good  start  and  John  Deere  applauds  the  Chairman’s  initiative  in  scheduling  it,
but  while  one  hearing  is  necessary,  it  is  not  likely  sufficient  given  the  magnitude
of  the  challenge.  While  we  believe  most  if  not  all  U.S.  standards  setting  organiza-
tions are already well aware of the issues, many companies are just starting to un-
derstand  the  implications  and  many  small-  and  medium-size  manufacturers  and
service providers remain unaware.

In  this  vain,  we  seriously  urge  Congress  to  consider  endorsement  of  the  United
States  Standards  Strategy  (USSS),  currently  being  developed  by  a  large  cross-sec-
tion of U.S. industry, standards developing organizations, standards developing con-
sortia, government agencies, consumer groups and conformity assessment organiza-
tions  under  the  auspices  of  ANSI.  It  highlights  the  inherent  strengths  of  the  U.S.
Standards system and recommends activities, if undertaken and executed effectively
may  neutralize  much  of  what  is  currently  perceived  by  some  as  a  disadvantage  to
U.S. interests.

Going  beyond  endorsing  the  strategy,  we  believe  that  Federal  and  State  govern-
ments  need  to  put  a  high  priority  on  providing  more  Technical  Assistance  to  our
trading  partners  and  into  the  promotion  of  U.S.-based  standards  and  technology  as
an alternative to the European approach. Specific activities funded by the industries
like  ours  have  helped  in  some  sectors  but  are  not  sufficient  given  the  scope  of  the

26

European  effort.  We  do  not  believe  we  have  to  match  the  European  Union  dollar
for Euro, but a greater percentage of the funding currently going to facilitate devel-
opment  through  organizations  like  USAID,  should  be  allocated  to  Technical  Assist-
ance with due consideration to priorities based on trading volumes and strategic re-
lationships.

Similarly, we need consistent and predictable funding of the Standards and Trade
activities  in  the  Department  of  Commerce,  NIST,  the  International  Trade  Adminis-
tration,  USTR,  the  Departments  of  State,  Defense  and  Energy  and  other  agencies
but  with  the  assurance  of  more  effective  coordination  between  these  agencies.  The
Interagency  Council  on  Standards  already  exists  but  needs  broader  participation
from  some  Departments  and  Agencies  and  a  higher  level  of  visibility  to  its  rec-
ommendations.  To  this  end,  we  respectfully  suggest  Congress  might  consider
amending  the  National  Technology  Transfer  Act  of  1996  to  put  more  emphasis  on
such  communication,  coordination  and  alignment  with  consideration  of  creating  a
Standards ‘‘czar’’ to provide appropriate accountability.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  DONALD  R.  DEUTSCH,  VICE  PRESIDENT,
STANDARDS  STRATEGY  AND  ARCHITECTURE,  ORACLE  COR-
PORATION
Dr. DEUTSCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Wu,  Members  of  the  Sub-
committee, my name is Don Deutsch. I am Vice President of Stand-
ards Strategy and Architecture at Oracle.

I  am  here  today  as  Chair  of  the  Standardization  Policy  Com-
mittee of the Information Technology Industry Council, ITI, a trade
association  of  31  global  and  market-leading  high-tech  companies.
In addition to personally participating in a variety of standards-set-
ting  organizations,  I  am  responsible  for  orchestrating  my  com-
pany’s  participation  in  standards  and  consortia  forums.  More  than

200  Oracle  engineers  are  involved  in  100-plus  working  groups  and
over  70  consortia  and  formal  standards  bodies  around  the  world.
All  ITI  member  companies,  as  well  as  the  entire  technology  indus-
try, have comparable levels of investment and standards body par-
ticipation.

ITI appreciates the Committee’s focus on standards and your un-
derstanding of the critical impact on the continued competitiveness
of  the  U.S.  high-tech  industry.  Many  of  the  most  pressing  policy
issues  before  the  Congress  today  have  significant  inter-operability
in  its  standardization  components,  such  as  ensuring  our  national
security,  improving  access  to  and  quality  of  medical  care,  and  pro-
tecting the environment.

My  remarks  today  will  cover  three  areas:  the  diverse  worldwide
IT  standardization  process  that  has  served  the  U.S.  industry  well,
international  trends  that  are  at  odds  with  the  U.S.  approach,  and
the  use  of  standards  advocacy  to  stimulate  openness  in  trade  and
market.

In  the  technology  industry,  a  focus  on  how  standards  are  devel-
oped  in  the  United  States  misses  the  mark.  Our  industry  designs
and builds products for global markets, and we develop globally-rel-
evant  standards  in  multiple  venues  and  organizations  around  the
world.  Standards  are  at  a  foundation  of  the  new  global  technology
economy. The growth and success of the U.S.-led global IT industry
is  attributable,  in  large  part,  to  the  development  and  use  of  mar-
ket-led, voluntary standards.

To frame our perspective, I would like to highlight a recent expe-
rience,  which  the  Chairman  mentioned  in  his  opening  remarks,
that  our  industry  had  in  China.  You  may  have  heard  of  this  issue
referred  to  by  its  popular  acronym,  ‘‘WAPI.’’  This  example  high-
lights  the  many  challenges  the  industry  is  facing,  not  only  in
China,  but  also  around  the  globe.  Last  year,  the  Chinese  govern-
ment proposed a mandatory standard for Wireless Local Area Net-
work  products  in  China,  mandating  the  specific  technology  incom-
patible  with  international  standards  and  requiring  local  Chinese
production  of  that  technology.  U.S.  technology  companies  faced  a
major  dilemma.  They  could  either  be  forced  to  collaborate  with  a
select few Chinese competitors or abandon the Chinese market and
its opportunities altogether.

After  facing  coordinated  pressure  from  the  highest  levels  of  the
Administration  and  Congress,  the  Chinese  government  agreed  to
indefinitely  suspend  implementation  of  ‘‘WAPI’’,  revise  the  speci-
fication  based  on  comments  from  foreign  and  domestic  firms,  and
participate in international standards bodies. By standing firm, we
avoided  a  terrible  precedent  that  would  have  encouraged  China
and  other  countries  to  follow  similar  paths  of  discrimination
against foreign firms through the standards process.

While  we  may  attribute  the  Chinese  approach  to  standards-set-
ting  to  their  status  as  an  emerging  and  rapidly-developing  econ-
omy, the EU and other regions of the world are increasingly using
top-down approaches to standardization driven by regulatory inter-
ests rather than by market-led requirements.

We  believe  that  the  best  role  for  the  Federal  Government  in
standardization  is  in  partnership  with  industry.  Specifically,  we
look  to  the  U.S.  Government  to  promote  the  voluntary,  market-

driven standards process that has served industry well and to stim-
ulate  openness  in  trade  and  markets  by  helping  to  defend  against
the  use  of  standards  as  barriers  to  innovation  and  market  access.
Moving  toward  these  items,  ITI  recommends  that  the  U.S.  Gov-
ernment  strengthen  current  standards  liaison  and  attache´ pro-
grams  of  the  Department  of  Commerce,  including  additional  staff
and  resources  to  ensure  effective  coordination  and  promotion  of
standards,  technical,  regulatory,  and  market  access  activities
across  all  relevant  government  agencies,  redouble  advocacy  efforts
to promote global, market-led, voluntary standards that support in-
novation  and  inter-operability.  In  this  role,  the  U.S.  Government
should  directly  engage  with  other  governments  about  how  inter-
nationally-recognized  market-led  technology  and  standards  can
grow economies and benefit all parties.

And finally, Mr. Chairman, we must, together, look at how to de-
velop  metrics  to  provide  much-needed  standards  impact  analyses.
For  example,  there  would  be  real  policy  and  commercial  use  for
analyses of global economic impact of standards. With this informa-
tion,  we  can  promote  together  global,  market-led,  voluntary  stand-
ards that benefit consumers’ industry economies around the world.
Again,  Mr.  Chairman,  Members  of  the  Subcommittee,  thank  you
for  the  opportunity  to  discuss  these  important  issues  with  you
today.

[The prepared statement of Dr. Deutsch follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DONALD R. DEUTSCH

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Wu, Members of the Subcommittee, my name is
Don Deutsch, and I am Vice President, Standards Strategy and Architecture at Ora-
cle. For over 25 years I have chaired the INCITS H2 Technical Committee that de-
fines  the  SQL  language  standard  that  all  relational  database  system  products,  in-
cluding  Oracle’s,  support.  I  am  responsible  for  orchestrating  and  coordinating  my
company’s participation in standards and consortia forums across all business units
and  geographies.  In  that  capacity  I  represent  Oracle  at  the  policy  level  in  various
consortia  as  well  as  in  formal  standards  bodies,  including  the  INCITS  Executive
Board,  the  Executive  Committee  for  the  Java  Community  Process,  and  the  Amer-
ican  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)  Board  of  Directors.  I  also  serve  as  Presi-
dent  of  the  Enterprise  Grid  Alliance,  a  consortium  focusing  on  accelerating  the  ap-
plication  of  Grid  technology  in  commercial  and  public  sector  data  centers.  In  many
respects the diversity of the bodies in which I participate is reflective of the nature
of standards development in the technology industry.

I  am  honored  to  appear  before  this  subcommittee  today  in  my  capacity  as  Chair-
man of the Standardization Policy Committee for the Information Technology Indus-
try  Council.  ITI  is  an  elite  group  of  the  Nation’s  top  high-tech  companies  and  is
widely  recognized  as  the  tech  industry’s  most  effective  lobbying  organization  in
Washington.  ITI  helps  member  companies  achieve  their  policy  objectives  through
building  relationships  with  Members  of  Congress,  Administration  officials,  and  for-
eign governments; organizing industry-wide consensus on policy issues; and working
to enact tech-friendly government policies.

ITI would like to address three very important issues:

1. The Chinese and European approaches to standardization;
2. The U.S. approach to standardization; and
3. The U.S. Government’s role in promoting the recognition of industry-led, vol-
untary standards, as well as in preventing standards from being used as bar-
riers to market access.

ITI  appreciates  your  focus  on  standards  and  their  impact  on  the  competitiveness
of  the  U.S.  high-tech  industry.  Technology  standards  are  directly  and  critically  re-
lated to innovation and the creation of competitive global markets. Many of the most
pressing  policy  issues  before  the  Congress  today  have  a  significant  standardization
component, such as ensuring our national security, improving access to and quality
of medical care, and protecting the environment.

Background

29

Let  me  begin  by  emphasizing  the  critical  importance  of  standards  to  the  tech-
nology sector. Standards are at the foundation of the global information and commu-
nications technology (ICT) economy. They create value and aggregate markets. They
facilitate  technology  diffusion,  promote  production  efficiency,  product  compatibility,
inter-operability,  and  enhanced  competition.  They  help  drive  down  costs  for  con-
sumers, facilitate communication among buyers and sellers of important commercial
information.  In  many  cases,  they  advance  the  public  welfare,  through  the  adoption
of product safety standards, for example.

Industry  recognizes  that  standards  are  not  only  the  domain  of  the  technical  and
business communities. Policy makers in the U.S. and abroad are increasingly inter-
ested  in  and  actively  influencing  a  range  of  standards  and  technical  regulatory
issues.  Governmental  interest  and  activity  plays  a  critical  role  in  today’s  global
economy and influences the competitiveness of the ICT industry. Representatives of
the technology industry work very hard to carefully frame our discussions with pol-
icy  makers  as  we  work  cooperatively  to  address  critical  standards  policy  matters
and define appropriate roles. As important as these issues are, they are not simple.
There is often a need for nuanced understanding of standardization policy issues as
the  objectives  of  different  interests,  both  domestically  and  abroad,  are  not  always
aligned.

One  way  to  help  clarify  matters  is  to  explain  what  the  high-tech  industry  means
when  we  talk  about  ‘‘standards.’’  In  our  sector,  the  majority  of  ICT  standards  are
developed  in  a  variety  of  open,  international  standards  development  processes  and
are  adopted  and  implemented  on  a  market-driven,  voluntary  basis.  In  few  cases  is
the adoption of ICT standards mandated by governments.
Chinese and European Approaches to Standardization

China’s  approach  to  and  use  of  standards  is  a  complex  set  of  issues.  It  is  a  well-
publicized  fact  that  the  Chinese  Government  wants  to  develop  a  robust  domestic
high-technology industry. This is not unique to China, as many governments around
the  world,  including  our  own,  want  to  see  healthy  and  competitive  domestic  indus-
tries.  The  use  and  promotion  of  national  or  regional  standards  is  one  mechanism
that  some  governments  use  to  achieve  their  industrial  policy  objectives.  Perhaps  I
can  best  illustrate  this  point  with  a  recent  experience  that  our  industry  had,  one
that we believe highlights many challenges the industry is facing, not only in China,
but also around the globe.

The  Chinese  Government  proposed  the  mandatory  adoption  of  a  Chinese-devel-
oped  Wireless  Local  Area  Network  (WLAN)  standard,  best  known  by  its  acronym,
‘‘WAPI.’’

In  May  of  2003,  The  Chinese  Government  issued  compulsory  ‘‘WAPI’’  security
standards  that  were  set  to  go  into  effect  on  June  1,  2004,  and  were  incompatible
with the international standards upon which most WLAN products are based. More-
over,  China  only  provided  the  technology  underlying  this  mandatory  technical
standard to several of its domestic producers of wireless equipment, and designated
these companies as the obligatory production partners of any foreign manufacturers
willing to license the mandated technology and seeking to market these products in
China.

Thus,  in  order  to  comply  with  the  proposed  regulations,  U.S.  technology  compa-
nies faced a major dilemma: either collaborate with a select number of their Chinese
competitors  to  co-produce  products  for  the  Chinese  market,  and  thus  potentially  be
forced  to  share  valuable  intellectual  property  with  their  Chinese  competitors  and
run afoul of U.S. export control regulations, or abandon the Chinese market and its
opportunities altogether.

These regulations also would have effectively excluded China from the world mar-
ket because WLAN products made outside China would not have worked, essentially
segmenting the world market for these products.

ITI  worked  very  closely  with  our  industry  colleagues  around  the  world,  and  also
brought together the various groups in the U.S., to closely collaborate and maintain
a  strong  industry  voice  on  this  issue.  ITI  worked  hard  to  keep  our  government  in-
formed  and  to  make  sure  this  issue  was  on  the  agenda  of  both  the  Administration
and  the  Congress.  After  considerable  dialogue  culminating  in  the  April  2004  meet-
ing  of  the  Joint  Commission  on  Commerce  and  Trade,  the  Chinese  Government
agreed  to  indefinitely  suspend  implementation  of  this  mandatory  standard,  revise
the  standard  based  on  comments  from  foreign  and  domestic  firms,  and  participate
in international standards bodies.

Yes, this was an important result for U.S. industry, but it was an equally impor-
tant  precedent  for  global  competition.  ICT  is  a  leading  U.S.  export  to  China,  ac-
counting for 26 percent of all U.S. exports to China in 2002. This amounts to several

billion  dollars  per  year  of  U.S.  tech  exports  to  China.  Many  of  these  current  and
as yet to be designed U.S.-made products and components would have been affected
by  this  standard,  jeopardizing  high-end  U.S.  jobs.  By  standing  firm  against  WAPI,
the  U.S.  Government  has  ensured  that  the  fast  growing  wireless  market  in  China
(forecast  to  grow  by  25  percent  per  year)  remains  open  to  global  competition.  Addi-
tionally, the U.S. high-tech industry avoided the precedent that would have encour-
aged  China’s  bad  behavior,  and,  potentially  encouraged  other  countries  that  might
choose  to  similarly  discriminate  against  foreign  firms  through  the  standards  proc-
ess.

This  example  illustrates  the  concerns  that  many  industrial  sectors,  particularly
the U.S. high-technology sector, are currently facing in China. The damaging prece-
dent  that  could  have  been  set  with  WAPI,  in  which  a  government—a  signatory  to
the WTO agreement—mandates a technology and forces domestic production of that
technology,  would  have  had  significant,  negative  implications  for  technological  de-
velopment and global economic growth.

I would like to shift now to Europe. As a global industry, the IT sector recognizes
that the European standards infrastructure—which includes the national and Euro-
pean standards organizations (ESOs) and the European Commission (EC) and mem-
ber  state  governments—is  sophisticated,  complex,  and  effective.  The  European
standards  infrastructure  has  demonstrated  a  considerable  ability  to  set  a  single
standard  for  the  internal  European  market,  drive  it  through  the  ISO/IEC  system
and  promulgate  it  globally  by  leveraging  its  market  power  and  Commission-funded
trade promotion efforts.

The impact of European standards activity reaches well beyond the EU. Many de-
veloping countries in Asia and the Americas look to Europe for leadership on stand-
ards  and  regulatory  processes.  For  example,  the  European  Commission  funds,  with
more  than  60m  Euro,  an  alliance  for  the  Information  Society  with  Latin  America.
This  initiative  includes  a  specific  standards  component,  with  the  stated  objective  of
promoting the European system of standardization and creating medium- and long-
term  partnerships  between  the  EU  and  Latin  America.  This  is  an  explicit  strategy
targeted directly at our industry with the objective of extending European influence
to the standards and regulatory bodies in third markets.

Let me briefly speak to one very costly example of this dynamic. It involves stand-

ards related to Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) for high-tech products.

In  1989,  the  European  Commission  issued  the  EMC  Directive  requiring  that  the
electrical  system  in  the  EU  be  protected  from  unacceptable  disruption  from  radio
frequency  and  harmonic  interference.  The  directive  was  based  upon  the  pre-
cautionary principle. The resulting harmonic emissions standards have no technical
justification. There is a complete absence of data demonstrating any widespread un-
acceptable  levels  of  harmonic  interference  from  consumer  electronic  products.  As
this standard is now implemented, it places the burden of mitigating a potential and
undocumented  EU  electrical  grid  issue  on  manufacturers  with  no  corresponding
mitigation  measures  on  the  utility  companies.  The  standards  (EN  61000–3–2  and
EN  61000–3–3)  are  overly  restrictive,  apply  to  every  piece  of  equipment  produced,
and increase the consumer cost of products by over $1B annually in Europe.

Unfortunately, despite the lack of technical justification for this standard and the
fact that it has been created under irregular procedures, we now see other countries,
including China, Indonesia, India, Russia, and potentially others in Africa, Asia, and
South  America,  considering  the  adoption  of  these  standard.  This  is  a  concern  to
product  manufacturers,  and  for  an  obvious  reason:  the  growth  of  this  standard  will
drive  a  significant  increase  in  unwarranted  additional  costs  and  technical  require-
ments for the impacted equipment.

ITI’s view is that the objectives for technical regulations should be to ensure safe
and  legal  products.  Technical  regulations  should  never  be  more  trade-restrictive
than  necessary  and  governments  should  consider  alternatives  whenever  possible.
This  one  European  example  demonstrates  the  impact  on  the  marketplace  of  tech-
nical regulations. Governments should reference standards as the basis for technical
regulations  under  certain,  limited  circumstances.  When  standards  are  intended  for
use  by  governments  in  regulations,  the  content  of  the  standard  and  the  process  for
developing  it  are  critically  important.  Governments  should  reference  only  those
standards  that  meet  the  test  of  real  usage  (i.e.,  they  are  responsive  to  real  world
conditions,  performance  (not  design)  based,  and  technically  sound  and  relevant  to
the regulation). Additionally, we believe governments should limit the use of stand-
ards  in  regulations  to  only  those  standards  that  are  developed  through  a  process
that is truly open and global.

The U.S. Approach to Standardization

31

For  our  industry,  the  focus  is  not  on  how  domestic  standards  are  developed  ‘‘in
the U.S.,’’ but rather on creating global technical standards that support the growth
of the worldwide ICT market. Because our industry designs and builds single prod-
ucts for a global market, we actually develop international, globally relevant stand-
ards  in  different  venues  and  organizations  around  the  world—not  simply  American
National  standards  in  a  U.S.  standardization  infrastructure.  We  need  that  flexi-
bility, because the ICT sector depends on standards today more than ever. The rapid
pace  of  change  in  our  sector,  with  product  cycles  measured  in  months,  not  years,
requires  companies  and  their  suppliers  constantly  to  modify,  improve,  and  re-de-
velop  their  technologies,  products,  and  services  in  order  to  satisfy  worldwide  con-
sumer  demands.  Standards  and  their  development  process  must  stay  relevant  and
keep pace with this fast changing, global marketplace.

That  being  said,  of  course  it  is  a  reality  that  governments  do  have  a  perspective
on  standardization.  How  governments  act  on  that  perspective  can  and  does  affect
global  commerce  and  competitiveness.  I  have  spoken  a  bit  already  about  perspec-
tives and approaches in Europe and China. Now I would like to say a little bit about
the situation here.

We  believe  that  the  growth  and  success  of  the  global  IT  industry  (much  of  which
is  based  here  in  the  U.S.)  is  built  in  large  part  upon  the  development  and  use  of
market-led,  voluntary  standards  that  provide  customer  value  and  facilitate  market
development.  Voluntary  standards  are  completely  market  and  consumer-driven.
They  are  not  mandated  by  government  regulations,  though  public  sector  input  as
technical experts and consumers is valuable. In almost all circumstances, the devel-
opment  and  use  of  voluntary  standards  are  a  key  means  to  create  and  expand  ICT
markets and maximize benefits to societies, consumers, and companies. Industry re-
sponds  to  consumers  as  the  ultimate  arbiters  when  it  is  developing  and  using  vol-
untary standards.

We  firmly  believe  that  a  shared  commitment  in  the  U.S.  by  industry,  consumers,
and government to this kind of voluntary and market driven approach to standard-
ization benefits the entire marketplace by creating real customer value through con-
sumer choice, lower costs, etc., and by facilitating market development by promoting
innovation,  product  inter-operability  and  the  voluntary  adoption  of  open  industry
standards.

We think this approach to standardization is clearly the optimal one. The success
of  the  global  IT  industry  demonstrates  that.  However,  we  do  believe  that  this  ap-
proach to standardization is not simple to explain, particularly in developing econo-
mies,  where  a  more  top-down  and  government-influenced  approach  is  more  readily
understood and accepted. Explaining the strengths of our perspective and approach
to standardization is a real challenge that we face in markets around the world.
The U.S. Government’s Role

When  asked  what  should  be  the  role  of  the  Federal  Government  in  standardiza-
tion,  we  are  always  very  careful.  We  believe  there  is  indeed  a  role.  It  is  a  limited
and clearly defined role that is responsive to industry needs and performed in part-
nership  with  industry.  It  is  an  increasingly  important  role.  Specifically,  we  look  to
the  U.S.  Government  to  perform  two  functions  related  to  standardization—to  pro-
mote  the  creation  and  use  of  voluntary,  market-driven  standards  and  to  stimulate
openness  in  trade  and  markets  by  helping  to  defend  against  the  use  of  standards
as barriers to innovation and market access.

We  can  point  to  important  and  useful  examples  of  how  the  USG  has  effectively
played  that  role.  As  we’ve  seen  with  WAPI,  positive  results  were  achieved  without
the delays associated with the lengthy legal process of the WTO dispute settlement
procedures.  The  well-executed  cooperation  and  coordination  at  a  variety  of  levels
within  and  among  U.S.  Government  agencies  and  the  Congress  was  highly  impres-
sive  and  crucial  to  the  success  of  this  issue.  We  believe  exactly  this  type  of  contin-
ued  coordination  will  be  necessary  going  forward.  With  WAPI,  we  may  have  struck
at  the  symptoms,  rather  than  the  underlying  cause  itself,  which  means  we  could
very  well  see  similar  attempts  by  China  and  other  countries  to  utilize  standards  to
force  the  creation  of  their  own  domestic  industries,  and  we  must  be  prepared,  as
industry and government, to address and resolve them.

We  can  also  point  to  three  specific  initiatives  that  can  help  the  U.S.  Government
to  play  that  role—two  that  exist  to  a  degree  and  one  that  does  not  exist  as  yet.  In
2002,  ITI  released  its  Vision  for  Standards  and  Technical  Regulations  and  pre-
sented  a  Recommended  Standards  Action  Plan  to  the  Department  of  Commerce.  I
will talk first about the initiatives that were the focus of that Action Plan. The Com-
merce  Department  has  taken  some  actions  on  these  initiatives  since  2002.  We  are

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

now  in  the  process  of  evaluating  progress  against  that  Action  Plan  and  suggesting
steps for the future.

In  2002,  we  recommended  that  the  Commerce  Department  create  a  high-level
standards and technical regulatory policy function to work with industry to identify
and  address  both  immediate  and  more  long-term  commercial  policy  issues  in  coun-
tries  and  regions  around  the  world.  The  Commerce  Department  has  taken  steps
through a Standards Liaison function to coordinate standards-related activity within
the  International  Trade  Administration  and,  to  an  extent,  across  the  Department.
The  Department  has  worked  to  understand  the  global  standards  objectives  of  the
IT  industry  and  to  assist,  including  by  coordinating  Commerce  Department  re-
sources,  in  pursuing  those  objectives.  Moving  forward,  we  will  recommend  that  the
Department take additional steps to strengthen the Liaison function, including with
additional staff and resources, in order to ensure the most effective standards, tech-
nical regulatory, and market access activity across all its agencies. ITI is committed
to  working  with  the  Commerce  Department  to  continue  making  progress  in  this
area.

In  our  2002  Standards  Action  Plan  for  the  Commerce  Department,  we  also  rec-
ommended  that  it  strengthen  the  existing  Standards  Attache´ Program.  In  par-
ticular,  we  sought  a  program  expansion  to  include  attaches  for  China,  the  rest  of
Asia,  and  Geneva  to  supplement  existing  attache´s  in  Brussels  (to  deal  with  Euro-
pean  standards  issues)  and  in  Brazil.  Because  of  the  strategic  utility  of  this  pro-
gram,  we  also  recommended  that  the  Commerce  Department  take  necessary  steps
to  ensure  that  it  is  both  managed  and  located  within  the  Department  to  retain  an
exclusive  focus  on  standards  and  technical  regulatory  issues  around  the  world.  We
are pleased to learn that we will likely see a standards attache´ in China very soon.
We appreciate the Department’s efforts in making that happen. Moving forward, we
would  like  to  position  the  program  for  ongoing  effectiveness,  and  we  recommend
that the Department support a formal assessment of the Attache´ program’s results,
its  training  program,  location  within  the  department,  and  budgetary  needs.  ITI  is
committed to working with the Commerce Department to continue making progress
on these recommendations.

Finally, I would like to speak briefly about another potential activity for the USG
and  the  Commerce  Department  that  we  believe  is  critically  important  moving  for-
ward and one that should be given serious consideration. In our 2002 Standards Ac-
tion  Plan  for  the  Commerce  Department,  we  recommended  that  it  provide  much-
needed  standards  impact  analysis.  For  example,  there  would  be  a  real  policy  and
commercial use for some analysis of key policy issues (e.g., defining what is the glob-
al  economic  impact  of  standards,  developing  a  comparison  of  government  support
and promotion of standards, forecasting global standards participation trends, etc.).
Related  to  this  analysis,  we  also  recommend  that  the  Department  create  an  early
warning system to detect and alert industry to global standards and technical regu-
latory issues that could impact market access.

Since 2002, the Commerce Department has worked with ITI and others to create,
on a pilot basis, an ICT Standards Dialogue between the U.S. Government and the
European  Commission  (EC)  as  a  form  of  ‘‘early  warning  system.’’  The  ICT  industry
has used this Dialogue to work with the Commerce Department (and other agencies)
on important ICT accessibility standardization issues in Europe.

Moving forward, we think that the Commerce Department can work with industry
to  continue  strengthening  and  examining  the  pilot  U.S.–EU  ICT  Standards  Dia-
logue.  Additionally,  we  see  today  even  more  clearly  than  in  2002  a  critical  oppor-
tunity  to  support  industry’s  standardization  policy  and  market  access  objectives
around  the  world  by  working  with  industry  to  develop  a  standards  and  market  ac-
cess  research  and  analysis  program  to  better  understand  the  key  issues  that  we
have been discussing at this hearing today. The Commerce Department has existing
staff  expertise  that  could  be  valuable  in  designing  and  implementing  this  research
and analysis program. ITI is committed to working with the Commerce Department
to continue making progress on these recommendations.

Finally,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  conclude  by  saying  that  from  our  various
experiences  with  standards  policy  issues  in  markets  around  the  world,  we  have
learned  that  our  industry  needs  to  engage  in  an  ongoing  basis  at  the  policy  level
directly with our government and other governments, particularly in emerging mar-
kets,  about  how  technology  and  standards  can  help  grow  their  economies  and  why
it is in their interest to adopt and deploy internationally-recognized, voluntary, mar-
ket-driven  standards.  We  need  to  redouble  our  already  considerable  efforts  pro-
moting  processes  that  support  such  standards  since  they  address  user  needs  and
promote  innovation  and  inter-operability.  We  need  to  encourage  market  access  so
that consumers, industry, and economies around the world can benefit from innova-
tive technological advancements.

tunity to discuss these important issues with you today.

Chairman  EHLERS.  Thank  you.  And  it  is  interesting,  we  have
problems  ranging  from  two-cylinder  tractors  to  large  earthmovers
down to tiny transistors.

Mr. Bhatia, let us hear from the Underwriters.
STATEMENT OF MR. JOE S. BHATIA, VICE PRESIDENT AND

CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, UNDERWRITERS LABORATORY
Mr. BHATIA. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.
Thank  you  and  the  distinguished  Members  of  the  Committee  for

this opportunity to appear before you.

In  addition  to  being  affiliated  with  Underwriters  Laboratories,  I
am  also  the  Chairman  of  I–Tech  16,  which  is  the  advisory  com-
mittee  to  U.S.  Congress,  USTR,  and  Department  of  Commerce  on
issues related to trade, technical barriers, and standards. I am also
the  current  Chairman  of  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  Committee.
The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  that  has  been  discussed  by  several
panel  members  is  in  the  purview  of  our  Committee  and  working
fast and furiously to develop that and finalize it.

UL is pleased to see the increased attention being given to stand-
ards and technical regulations in trade. We believe that your focus
and  the  U.S.  Government’s  support  on  these  issues  will  help  U.S.
industry  competitiveness.  I  would  note,  though,  that  testing  and
certification,  in  other  words,  conformity  assessment,  is  as  critical
for product market access and market acceptance as the standards
themselves, so the two issues must be addressed simultaneously.

But  the  standards  and  conformity  assessment  systems  currently
operating  in  the  global  market  are  not  harmonized.  Compare  this

with  the  trade  liberalization  that  is  going  on  and  that  is  opening
up markets and prompting manufacturers to globalize their produc-
tion  processes  and  their  supplier  networks  to  remain  competitive
worldwide.

In the brief time we have to present oral comments, I would like

to highlight the following themes.

On  the  standardization  front,  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  the
U.S. system actually does work. Though decentralized, it effectively
serves the needs of all stakeholders. It promotes comprehensive ex-
pertise by encouraging participation of all public and private sector
experts in bringing all of the affected parties to the table.

The U.S. Government is an active participant and a true partner.
Many  U.S.  SDOs  produce  internationally-recognized  and  relevant
standards, which are used all over the world. As we look ahead and
see  ISO  and  IEC  standards  gain  greater  use  and  acceptance  glob-
ally,  it  is  critical  that  all  affected  U.S.  organizations  participate  in
these forums to ensure that U.S. safety systems and principles are
not  compromised  and  that  U.S.  products  and  technologies  are  not
excluded.

There is much opportunity for U.S.-China collaboration in devel-
oping  standards  and  technical  regulations.  U.S.  Government  can
help  open  up  additional  venues.  UL,  and  other  organizations  like
NFPA, have been working for a long time with China on standards
development,  specifically  in  the  areas  of  fire  protection  and  sig-
naling. There is a lot of room to enhance cooperation and participa-
tion  in  each  other’s  standards  committees  and  panels  on  an  ongo-
ing basis.

Now  shifting  to  the  conformity  assessment  arena,  we  all  recog-
nize  that  manufacturers  must  demonstrate  that  their  products
comply  with  the  requirements  and  standards  in  local  markets.
Local  governments  often,  though,  exclude  non-domestic  entities
from  conducting  the  necessary  testing  and  certification.  This  im-
pedes all manufacturers’ ability to streamline the certification proc-
ess,  which  is  necessary  to  obtain  the  necessary  certification  marks
to  sell  in  those  local  markets.  This  ultimately  increases  the  costs
associated  with  compliance.  National  treatment,  which  I  will  talk
about more in the later comments, for conformity assessment orga-
nizations is, perhaps, the most effective approach to providing man-
ufacturers  with  a  seamless  certification  program  where  services
can  be  bundled  and  streamlined  to  facilitate  simultaneous,  mul-
tiple-market access when necessary.

UL,  and  other  U.S.-based  testing  and  certification  organizations,
seek  recognition  from  U.S.  trade  negotiators  as  a  viable  business
whose  services  can  help  enhance  market  access  for  U.S.  exporters.
Moving  forward  and  looking  ahead,  the  advancement  of  stand-
ards  and  conformity  assessment  interests  of  U.S.  stakeholders
would require a much stronger public and private partnership. For
its  part,  the  U.S.  Government  should  consider  several  initiatives.
Let me outline a couple: ensuring that trade partners’ compliance
with obligations that they have signed in existing trade agreements
are  honored,  especially  in  countries  like  China,  Mexico,  and  Eu-
rope;  linking  standards  and  conformity  assessment  to  broader  dia-
logue with trade partners; negotiating new commitments and trade
agreements,  which  enable  certifiers  to  gain  acceptance  to  offer  do-

35

mestic  marks  in  their  markets;  and  adequately  funding  U.S.  Gov-
ernment-supported  outreach,  promotion,  and  technical  assistance
programs all over the world.

In  the  end,  globalization  will  place  pressures  on  standards  and
conformity  assessment  system  to  streamline  and  harmonize.  But
doing so needs to be done in a way that does not sacrifice the high
levels of product safety enjoyed in the U.S. today.

The U.S. Government has a real and meaningful role to play. We
look  forward  to  working  with  them  to  advance  U.S.  interests  and
to minimize the adverse impact of standards on trade activities.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Bhatia follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOE S. BHATIA

Chairman  Ehlers  and  distinguished  Committee  Members,  thank  you  for  this  op-
portunity  to  appear  before  you,  to  offer  Underwriters  Laboratories  (UL)  Inc.’s  in-
sights on the impact of voluntary standards and mandatory technical regulations on
global  trade,  and  to  recommend  ways  in  which  the  United  States  government  not
only  can  enhance  but  also  supplement  private  sector  efforts.  UL  is  pleased  to  see
the  increased  attention  being  given  to  standards  and  technical  regulations  in  trade
and  believes  that  U.S.  Government  support  on  these  issues  will  help  U.S.  industry
competitiveness and therefore create jobs. The following testimony is intended to ad-
dress the specific questions posed by the Committee, as well as to offer targeted rec-
ommendations  to  improve  the  U.S.  position  in  the  global  market  place  moving  for-
ward.  My  testimony  will  further  discuss  the  standards  and  conformity  assessment
nexus,  which  is  as  critical  for  products’  market  access  (regulated)  and  market  ac-
ceptance (voluntary) as the standards themselves.
Underwriters Laboratories in Brief

Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Inc. is an independent, not-for-profit product safe-
ty certification organization that has been testing products and writing safety stand-
ards  for  more  than  a  century.  It  was  founded  in  1894  with  a  mission  of  testing  for
public  safety,  as  defined  by  its  Articles  of  Incorporation,  and  strives  to  ensure  that
public  health  and  safety  is  protected  through  its  standards  development  activities
and product conformity assessment services. UL has developed and maintains more
than  850  product-based  Standards  for  Safety,  80  percent  of  which  have  achieved
American  National  Standards  (ANS)  status.1 And  UL  is  a  global  company,  with
more  than  25  affiliates  world  wide,  serving  more  than  71,000  manufacturers  in
nearly 100 countries.
UL in China and Europe:

UL entered the China market in 1980, when it established a cooperative relation-
ship with the China Certification & Inspection (Group) Co., Ltd. (CCIC) to carry out
on-site  follow-up  inspections  at  Chinese  factories  whose  products  had  already  been
certified as meeting UL’s rigorous safety requirements. Growing demand for product
safety testing and certification services prompted UL and CCIC to negotiate a joint
venture  in  2001.  The  joint-venture  testing  facility  located  in  Suzhou  became  fully
operation in the Fall of 2003 and performs safety tests according to UL’s Standards
for Safety in the most popular product categories, including such small home appli-
ances  as  lighting  fixtures  and  lamps,  fans,  rice  cookers,  toasters,  and  electric  tools.
The  facility’s  capabilities  will  expand  over  time  to  perform  tests  on  just  about  any-
thing exported from China.

Though  in  the  1920s  UL  had  agreements  with  inspection  companies  in  England
and  Germany,  it  was  not  until  1956  that  UL  began  testing  in  earnest  European-
made  products  according  to  U.S.-based  standards,  initiating  a  major  new  inter-
national activity. The on-site factory follow-up service inspections in Europe rapidly
grew  and  so  UL  contracted  with  additional  European-based  testing  and  inspection
authorities.  In  1996  UL  acquired  the  Danish  government-owned  testing  and  certifi-
cation laboratory DEMKO A/S (est. 1928) and formed it into a wholly owned affiliate
of  UL  Inc.  UL  has  since  been  represented  in  Europe  via  its  own  facilities,  and  has

cation by the SDO that due process was followed in the development of the standard.

grown  to  include  operations  in  the  United  Kingdom,  Italy,  Sweden,  Germany,
France, Spain, Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic.
Seeking Increased Collaboration With China.

.

.

Though  well  versed  in  providing  testing  and  certification  services  in  China  and
Europe  for  decades,  UL’s  engagement  on  standards  development  issues  largely  has
been  the  most  extensive  at  the  international  level—in  the  International  Electro-
technical Commission (IEC) and the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO). The level of engagement at the national and regional level through our affili-
ates  is  poised  to  increase.  As  UL’s  customers  manufacture  more  products  in  China,
they are seeking to incorporate the traditional elements of U.S. requirements in (or
influence the direction of) Chinese and EU member states’ standards.
China Collaboration—Present:

UL’s  active  collaboration  with  China  on  standards  development  has  been  most
evident  in  the  fire  protection  and  signaling  (e.g.,  fire  alarms)  arenas.  Discussions
have intensified over the past 18 months, in part because of UL’s engagement with
Chinese  regulators  through  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology
(NIST)’s  Standards  in  Trade  workshops  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce-
sponsored  U.S.–China  Standards  and  Conformity  Assessment  workshops.  UL  per-
ceives China’s interest in collaboration as stemming from a desire to improve safety
in  the  built  environment,  particularly  as  China  ramps  up  for  the  2008  Olympics,
as  well  as  enhancing  the  competitiveness  of  Chinese  manufacturers’  products
around the world.
China Collaboration—Future:

In recent years, China has demonstrated a commendable interest in enhancing its
participation in international standards development and in upgrading its standards
system  to  comply  with  WTO  obligations,  among  other  things.  The  American  Na-
tional  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)’s  testimony  speaks  to  China’s  recently  concluded
assessment  of  its  national  standards  system.  Among  the  strategic  tasks  presented
were China’s wish to ‘‘improve the market adaptability and competitiveness of Chi-
nese  technical  standards,’’  as  well  as  ‘‘develop  independently  self-proprietary  tech-
nical standards through effective measures, so as to improve international competi-
tiveness  of  China’s  technical  standards  and  therefore  increase  the  international
market  share  of  Chinese  products.’’  With  China  setting  a  2010  deadline  for  over-
hauling its technical standards system, the time certainly is ripe for increased U.S.–
China  collaboration,  with  the  impact  extending  to  the  international  stage  (ISO  and
IEC).

China  has  shown  some  interest  in  adopting  UL  Standards  for  Safety.  The  Na-
tional  Electrical  Manufacturers  Association  (NEMA)  has  suggested  that  China  con-
sider  adopting  the  tri-national  (United  States,  Mexico,  and  Canada)  fuse  and  fuse-
holder standards. These talks very much remain in the preliminary stages, however.
UL  also  is  considering  the  possibility  of  seeking  observer  status  on  select  PRC
standards  technical  panels,  with  the  aim  of  encouraging  the  adoption  of  tried  and
true  U.S.  requirements  as  appropriate.  This  collaboration  would  serve  not  only  to
enhance  market  access  for  U.S.  products  designed  around  and  certified  to  comply
with  such  U.S.  requirements,  but  also  to  forge  a  partnership  that  will  transfer  to
international  standards  development  and  harmonization  efforts.  UL  may  also  ac-
tively seek to engage Chinese experts for participation in UL’s own standards devel-
opment processes.

New technologies also pose an opportunity for collaboration with China, including

radio frequency identification (RFID) and renewable energy.

Stage

The  development  of  standards  and  technical  regulations  in  Europe  occur  at  two
levels—the  individual  member-state  level,  and  the  European  Commission  level.  At
the regional level, there are voluntary ‘‘European Norms (ENs)’’ and New Approach
‘‘directives’’ that set essential requirements for regulated products. UL has engaged
somewhat in the development of European Norms (EN), but has been more actively
involved with Europe in standards development at the international level.

UL  has  been  an  active  participant  in  IEC  and  ISO  standards  development  and
harmonization  activities  for  decades.  In  addition  to  participating  in  numerous  IEC
and ISO Technical Committees and related U.S. Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs),
UL  also  adopts  international  standards  (such  as  IEC  and  ISO)  with  National  Dif-
ferences  (only  when  needed)  to  co-exist  with  current  UL  requirements  and  unique
safety needs in the United States based on its infrastructure and traditional expec-
tations.  If  necessary,  existing  UL  Standards  for  Safety  can  be  co-maintained  with

the internationally harmonized standard for a limited time frame for those manufac-
turers  only  marketing  products  in  North  America.  UL  also  promotes  international
harmonization by encouraging adoption of basic North American safety principles in
standards  developed  by  international  standards  bodies  to  reduce  the  need  for  Na-
tional Differences in UL and ANSI/UL Standards.

UL believes that some progress has been made to incorporate U.S.-based require-
ments  in  the  development  of  new  international  standards  or  with  harmonization  of
existing  standards.  However,  there  is  room  for  improvement,  particularly  as  the
United  States  utilizes  more  IEC-based  standards.  Some  sectors  within  the  United
States believe that the IEC process is a violation of the World Trade Organization’s
Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  (TBT)  Agreement  because  it  results  in  requirements
that are most favorable only to Europe. The European Union’s well-financed and co-
ordinated  technical  assistance  program  for  developing  countries  serves  only  to  fur-
ther disadvantage U.S. interests. The degree to which different sectors are adversely
affected  varies,  but  some  sectors  are  particularly  frustrated  with  the  IEC  process
and  the  difficulty  in  incorporating  U.S.  infrastructure  and  climatic  essential  dif-
ferences in requirements (EDRs)2 into IEC standards to make them truly more glob-
al.  At  this  time,  these  sectors  are  committed  to  working  within  the  IEC  to  affect
the needed changes.
Recognizing the Merits of the U.S. Standards System.

.

.

The United States relies heavily on the private sector for voluntary standards de-
velopment.  Under  the  auspices  of  the  1996  National  Technology  Transfer  and  Ad-
vancement  Act  (NTTAA),  U.S.  Government  agencies  are  encouraged  to  rely  on  vol-
untary  consensus  standards  (VCS)  whenever  applicable  and  appropriate.  While  our
government  generally  has  not  driven  the  standards  development  process,  it  has
been  an  active  participant  and  partner.  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments  de-
velop and issue procurement specifications and mandatory codes, rules, and regula-
tions. Openness, balance, consensus, and due process are the fundamental principles
of the American National Standards process.

The U.S. system, although decentralized, effectively serves the needs of all stake-
holders.  It  promotes  comprehensive  expertise  by  encouraging  participation  of  all
public  and  private  technical  experts.  Stakeholders’  needs  are  reflected  because  the
process  is  open  to  all  interested  parties,  from  manufacturers,  users/consumers,  the
government,  utilities,  material  suppliers,  regulatory  agencies,  educators,  code  orga-
nizations, and any other interested party. The process produces a ‘‘balanced’’ stand-
ard  because  all  stakeholders  are  able  to  participate;  the  standards  users’  interests
are  protected  while  at  the  same  time  meeting  needs  of  industry  that  the  standard
will  affect.  Standards  are  based  on  market-driven  needs,  not  mandate.  From  time
to time, issues and redundancies emerge as a result of the decentralized system, but
careful coordination among interested parties works to rectify that. In UL’s opinion,
this  openness  is  unique.  How  many  other  countries  around  the  world  invest  their
time  and  resources  to  get  all  the  interested  parties  at  the  table  to  consider  health
and safety requirements?

Many U.S. standards are international in scope and application and currently are
accepted  in  other  countries.  In  some  cases,  however,  a  number  of  developing  coun-
tries have adopted a policy of accepting only IEC/ISO standards. This is increasingly
an issue in China, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. EU enlargement pre-
sents  related  issues.  The  end  result,  if  left  unchecked,  could  lead  to  lost  market
share  for  some  U.S.  exports  that  comply  with  valid  and  internationally  accepted
U.S. standards and that are certified under reputable U.S. programs.
.
.And Promoting Standards Harmonization Internationally

.
UL has long recognized the need for increased harmonization with IEC standards
and has recently adopted a more aggressive policy toward standards harmonization.
U.S. manufacturers are realizing that the ‘‘world is their oyster’’ for their innovative
and  creative  products.  UL’s  harmonization  priorities  are  largely  driven  by  what  in-
dustry perceives as priority areas for harmonization. When harmonizing UL’s stand-
ards  at  the  regional  or  international  level,  however,  it  is  paramount  that  essential
U.S.  safety  principles  are  protected,  even  if  this  means  developing  National  Dif-
ferences. National Differences are not unique to the United States. In international
standards meetings, however, the United States is singled out whereas in many Eu-
ropean  and  Asian  countries,  the  National  Differences  are  undeclared  and  out-of-
country testing is not permitted. In such cases, the United States is not the barrier

2 Criteria  for  Essential  Differences  in  Requirements  include  needs  of  major  segment  of  the
global  market;  differences  in  technical  infrastructure—frequencies,  voltages,  currents,  earthing
systems, and differences in climatic conditions.

to  trade.  The  barrier  is  the  country  to  which  U.S.  manufacturers  desire  to  exports
their  products.  On  the  other  hand,  UL  makes  every  effort  to  avoid  mutually  exclu-
sive requirements when National Differences are necessary.

UL’s approach to standards harmonization incorporates several guiding principles:
• Ensure  that  the  harmonized  standards  preserve,  at  a  minimum,  the  current

level of safety expected by the U.S. public,

• Coordinate  and  collaborate  with  other  SDOs  to  avoid  duplicate  documents  or

requirements,

• Consider  the  merit(s)  of  harmonizing  existing  standards,  whether  by  accept-
ance of IEC requirements or by advocating a UL standard or its essential re-
quirements as the basis of the harmonized standard, and

• Develop ‘‘globally’’ relevant standards in areas where standards do not exist.3
The result of this approach is that standards differences are minimized, standards
are  streamlined,  a  more  international  approach  to  standards  development  (con-
sistent with WTO TBT principles) is promoted, and unique locally developed stand-
ards without justification are discouraged.

As  ISO  and  IEC  standards  gain  greater  use  and  acceptance  globally,  it  is  critical
that  all  affected  U.S.  private  and  public  organizations  participate  in  these  forums
to  ensure  that  U.S.  safety  principles  are  reflected  and  that  U.S.  products  and  tech-
nologies are not excluded. Enhancing relations and promoting cooperation with like-
minded  countries  in  these  international  forums  is  critical  to  promoting  U.S.  inter-
ests.
The Standards-Conformity Assessment Nexus

Many  national,  regional  and  international  standards  and  conformity  assessment
systems around the world all share a common goal of minimizing the hazards asso-
ciated  with  and  ensuring  the  inter-operability  of  products  in  the  marketplace.  But
the  standards  and  conformity  assessment  systems  currently  operating  often  times
are  not  harmonized.  Contrast  this  with  trade  liberalization  opening  markets  and
prompting  manufacturers  to  globalize  their  production  processes  and  supplier  net-
works  to  remain  competitive.  With  roughly  80  percent  of  the  global  trade  (of  the
$7.3 trillion in 2003) affected by standards and related technical regulations for con-
formity assessment, the potential economic impact of meeting requirements in mul-
tiple markets is staggering.

Manufacturers  must  demonstrate  that  their  products  comply  with  requirements
through  domestic  conformity  assessment  processes,  where  applicable,  to  sell  prod-
ucts  in  those  markets.  In  many  cases,  certification  by  an  independent  third  party
is required, but the local governments often preclude non-domestic entities from pro-
viding those services. This impedes a manufacturer’s ability to streamline the num-
ber  of  testing  and  certification  organizations  it  engages  (on  global  basis)  to  obtain
the  necessary  certification  marks,  and  ultimately  increases  costs  associated  with
compliance—from the number of internal staff required to oversee the different com-
pliance processes to actual dollars expended for testing. It also impedes U.S. testing
and  certification  organizations’  ability  to  provide  global  compliance  solutions  for
their customers.

UL  believes  that  national  treatment  for  conformity  assessment  organizations  is
the  most  effective  approach  to  eliminating  many  trade  barriers  that  emerge  from
technical  regulations  and  standards.  National  treatment  enables  conformity  assess-
ment  bodies  in  one  country  to  provide  testing  and  certification  to  another  country’s
requirements  by  being  recognized  or  accredited  through  the  same  process  applied
to  domestic  bodies.  Different  standards  and  technical  requirements  can  result  in
multiple  testing  and  certification  requirements  for  manufacturers  seeking  to  sell
products  into  multiple  markets.  But  national  treatment  across  markets  would  en-
able  UL  and  other  conformity  assessment  organizations  to  provide  customers  with
a  seamless  certification  program  where  services  are  bundled  and  streamlined  to  fa-
cilitate timely, simultaneous, and effective market access for manufacturers.

3 Globally  relevant  standards:  ISO  defines  global  relevance  as  ‘‘the  required  characteristic  of
an  International  Standard  that  it  can  be  used/implemented  as  broadly  as  possible  by  affected
industries  and  other  stakeholders  in  markets  around  the  world.’’  Globally  relevant  standards
therefore  effectively  respond  to  regulatory  and  market  needs  (in  the  global  marketplace);  re-
spond to scientific and technical developments in various countries; do not distort markets; have
no  adverse  effects  on  fair  competition;  do  not  stifle  innovation  and  technological  development;
do  not  give  preference  to  characteristics  or  requirements  of  specific  countries  or  regions  when
different needs or interests exist in other countries or regions; and should be performance based
rather than design prescriptive.

From  time  to  time,  governments  have  turned  to  government-to-government  Mu-
tual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) to address the issue of market access for U.S.
conformity  assessment  bodies.  With  a  few  exceptions  like  the  APEC  telecom  MRA,
MRAs  have  created  unnecessary  bureaucracies,  have  proven  very  difficult  to  imple-
ment, and have reduced attention on national treatment as the preferred conformity
assessment solution. Negotiations for the U.S.–EU MRA lasted more than six years,
with only two of six sectoral annexes operational, and at least one annex suspended.
For all of this effort, only a handful of products have utilized the MRA. Implementa-
tion  of  the  medical  device  MRA  remains  troublesome,  as  the  European  Union  has
yet to approve the U.S. organizations designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA). FDA, in contrast, approved the EU designated counterparts several
years ago and they are already competing for business in the United States.
Where National Treatment Has Gone Right. . .

In some countries, like Japan, the government has introduced regulatory reforms
that permit non-domestic entities to seek accreditation and provide domestic testing
and certification services. We would like to see more countries introduce similar reg-
ulatory reforms.

The  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA)  introduced  national  treat-
ment  for  testing  and  certification  bodies.  Shortly  after  its  introduction  manufactur-
ers  began  working  with  a  single  certifier,  having  their  product  tested  once  and  ac-
cepted  in  both  Canada  and  the  United  States.  Required  factory  audits  for  certifi-
cation have been combined into a single system thereby lowering the cost of compli-
ance for products sold in Canada and the United States. Certifiers accredited under
both the Canadian and U.S. systems compete for manufacturers’ business. This com-
petitive environment has led to increased efficiency and value in testing and certifi-
cation programs. Because national level systems for accreditation of testing and cer-
tification continue in force, the high level of safety and national acceptance for prod-
ucts in both markets has been maintained.
. . .And Where Problems Remain:

Under  NAFTAA,  the  Mexican  government  committed  to  market  access/national
treatment  for  testing  and  certification  organizations  domiciled  in  the  United  States
and Canada. Even after the four-year transition period ended (in 1998), Mexico has
failed to implement directly its commitments. In January 2005, Mexican authorities
finally  issued  the  document  that  permitted  organizations  to  apply  for  accreditation.
The  application  documentation  requirements  present  a  challenge,  however,  and  no
entity, including UL, has yet been able to submit an application. UL has been work-
ing both with Mexican authorities and through the auspices of the Office of the U.S.
Trade  Representative  (USTR)  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  (DOC)  to  re-
solve matters, and is hopeful that a resolution will soon be found.

UL has been able to facilitate customers’ product certification applications for Chi-
na’s  CCC  mark  through  its  ‘‘agent’’  status.  This  means  making  sure  that  all  nec-
essary  documentation  is  in  compliance  with  the  CCC  mark  certification  require-
ments.  However,  UL’s  joint  venture  cannot  perform  related  tests  or  authorize  the
use of the CCC mark; the government currently restricts such activities to domestic
entities.  Ultimately,  UL–CCIC  would  like  to  be  accredited  to  provide  testing  and
certification services for the CCC mark.

China’s  WTO  accession  commitments  obligated  them  to  provide  National  Treat-
ment to non-domestic testing and conformity assessment organizations. Paragraphs
194 and 195 of the Working Party Report (WPR) reference these market access obli-
gations  for  conformity  assessment  organizations.  However,  unlike  the  services
schedule  that  outlines  a  timeline  for  testing  services,  the  WPR  does  not  outline  a
specific  timeline  for  implementing  market  access  for  conformity  assessment  organi-
zations. Regulations introduced in 2003 and early 2004 appeared to address testing
and  conformity  assessment  obligations  in  the  Commodity  Inspection  and  Appraisal
Institution Regulations (Order No. 58, effective January 2004) and PRC Regulations
on  Certification  and  Accreditation  (effective  November  2003).  However,  when
pressed  for  clarification  by  USTR  in  January  2004,  PRC  authorities  indicated  that
the scope of work did not include testing and certification for the CCC mark.

China has made commendable strides in bringing its product certification system
into  compliance  with  WTO  requirements  and  participates  in  international  schemes,
including  the  CB  scheme  for  safety  testing.4 In  some  cases,  however,  China  has

opted  not  to  participate  in  international  schemes  to  which  most  all  other  trading
partners  belong.  One  such  example  relates  to  electromagnetic  compatibility  (EMC)
testing. China opted out of the scheme for EMC, requiring in-country testing instead
of  accepting  reports  generated  by  other  participating  members.  Manufacturers  in
general  perceive  this  practice  as  creating  unnecessary  and  duplicative  testing  re-
quirements.

In  Europe,  UL  continues  to  face  market  access  issues  under  the  New  Approach,
which inherently lacks national treatment for conformity assessment organizations.5
Under the New Approach, Member States are responsible for the notification of No-
tified  Bodies  and  may  only  notify  bodies  within  their  territory.  Therefore,  U.S.  con-
formity  assessment  organizations  cannot  provide  cross-border  conformity  assess-
ment services in the European system. A soil-based presence is required.
What Can Be Done?

Advancing  the  standards  and  conformity  assessment  interests  of  U.S.  stake-
holders  will  require  a  stronger  public-private  partnership.  For  its  part,  the  private
sector—working  through  the  auspices  of  ANSI  and  with  input  from  U.S.  Govern-
ment  stakeholders—is  making  a  concerted  effort  to  develop  a  meaningful  U.S.
Standards Strategy (USSS) that ‘‘can be used by all interested parties to further ad-
vance  trade  issues  in  the  global  marketplace,  enhance  consumer  health  and  safety,
meet stakeholder needs and, as appropriate, advance U.S. viewpoints in the regional
and international arena.’’ 6 As the ANSI testimony notes, a ‘‘key aspect of the Strat-
egy  is  reference  to  the  requirements  of  the  WTO’s  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  as
related  to  standards  practices.’’  The  following  are  some  priority  considerations  that
fall within the twelve broad USSS initiatives:

• U.S.  stakeholders  should  take  the  lead  in  submitting  standards  development
proposals  and  requesting  recognition  of  U.S.  documents  at  the  international
level  in  such  emerging  national  priority  areas  as  homeland  security  and
nanotechnology.  Radio  Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  is  another  such  area
where the impact of standards on trade is potentially staggering.
• Government  and  private  sector  stakeholders  alike  should  work  toward  en-
hanced  protection  of  intellectual  property  rights  (IPR)  of  standards  develop-
ment organizations, especially in countries like China where general enforce-
ment of IPR has been uneven.
• U.S.  stakeholders  should  work  to  ensure  that  trade  partners  comply  with

WTO principles of openness, transparency, and advance notice.

UL  proposes  that  the  U.S.  Government  consider  initiatives  that  focus  on  negoti-
ating  new  commitments  in  trade  agreements,  incorporating  standards  and  con-
formity  assessment  technical  assistance  elements  into  all  future  U.S.-negotiated  bi-
lateral free trade agreements (FTAs), ensuring trade partners’ compliance with obli-
gations  under  existing  trade  agreements,  linking  standards  and  conformity  assess-
ment to broader dialogues with trade partners, adequately funding the office of the
Standards  Liaison  within  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  and  increasing  fund-
ing  for  existing  government  standards  programs  from  which  the  private  sector  de-
rives important benefits.
Negotiating New Commitments in Trade Agreements:

UL  and  other  U.S.-based  testing  and  certification  organizations  seek  recognition
from  U.S.  trade  negotiators  as  a  viable  business  sector  whose  services  can  help  en-
hance  market  access  for  U.S.  exports.  We  welcome  a  partnership  with  the  Office  of
the  U.S.  Trade  Representative  (USTR)  and  other  U.S.  Government  agencies  to  de-
fine and refine relevant provisions in FTAs and future WTO negotiating rounds. To

certification  organizations.  A  manufacturer  utilizing  a  CB  Test  Certificate  and  CB  Test  Report
issued by one of these organizations can obtain national product certification from other partici-
pating  member  organizations  without  the  need  for  re-testing.  UL  is  an  active  member  in  the
CB  Scheme  with  participating  certification  bodies  in  Canada,  Denmark,  Japan  and  the  United
States. The CB Scheme applies IEC based standards in 18 categories of electrical and electonic
products  from  office  equipment  and  electronics  to  household  and  similar  equipment  to  installa-
tion assessories. The CB Scheme includes safety testing, EMC testing and performance testing.
It has recently expanded into photovoltaics.

5 The  New  Approach  consists  of  more  than  25  directives  that  specify  safety,  health  and  envi-
ronmental  ‘‘essential  requirements.’’  European  harmonized  standards,  developed  by  the  Euro-
pean  standards  organizations,  provide  the  technical  answer  to  addressing  these  requirements.
Technical,  the  use  of  New  Approach  harmonized  standards  is  voluntary,  but  companies  using
other standards must prove how they are equivalent to the EU standards.

that end, USTR has recently engaged the testing and certification community in ne-
gotiating such commitments for the WTO Doha Round.

Within  the  WTO  Doha  negotiations  and  U.S.-negotiated  bilateral/regional  FTAs,
U.S. testing and certification organizations seek commitments from U.S. trade part-
ners—whether  through  enhancements  to  the  current  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade
Agreement or the market access for services schedule—to permit non-domestic test-
ing  and  certification  providers  to  apply  for  accreditation  to  offer  domestic  certifi-
cation  marks.  Those  applications  would  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  domestic
accreditation requirements.
Providing Technical Assistance in U.S.–Negotiated FTAs:

UL recommends that technical assistance provisions for standards and conformity
assessment systems be incorporated into all FTAs that the United States negotiates
moving  forward  and  that  Congress  appropriates  adequate  funding  for  execution  of
the  technical  assistance  programs.  Such  technical  assistance  provisions  in  the  Cen-
tral  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (CAFTA)  proved  helpful  in  educating  CAFTA
countries  about  the  U.S.  standards  and  conformity  assessment  system.  We  would
expect this education to influence CAFTA countries to establish and refine their own
systems in a way that (ideally) aligns with the United States, or at a minimum, re-
frains from introducing elements that unduly restrict market access for U.S. export-
ers.
Enforcing Existing Trade Agreement Commitments:

For Mexico, we ask that the United States incorporate a regulatory dialogue into
the  recently  announced  Security  and  Prosperity  Partnership  agenda  (under  the
Manufactured  Goods  Working  Group)  and  specifically  address  increased  access  for
non-domestic testing and certification organizations.

For China, we seek increased dialogue under both the WTO accession Transitional
Review  Mechanism  and  the  Joint  Commission  on  Commerce  and  Trade  to  develop
a  timeline  for  implementation  of  national  treatment  commitments  referenced  in
Paragraphs 194 and 195 of China’s Working Party Report.

For  Europe,  we  seek  increased  U.S.  Government  pressure  on  the  Europe  Union
to  implement  fully  its  obligations  under  the  EU–U.S.  MRA  for  medical  devices  by
approving the U.S. FDA-designated entities, including UL.
Incorporating Standards and Conformity Assessment Issues in Dialogues:

One  of  the  key  recommendations  to  emerge  from  the  DOC  Standards  Initiative
focused  on  enhanced  dialogues  with  foreign  governments.  A  more  active  standards
dialogue  between  and  among  countries  and  regions  could  help  prevent  standards
from becoming trade barriers. To that end, UL welcomes the inclusion of standards
and  conformity  assessment  issues  as  a  mainstay  component  of  such  bilateral  and
regional  dialogues  as  the  Security  and  Prosperity  Partnership  of  North  America,
EU–U.S.  Regulatory  Dialogue,  the  Transatlantic  Business  Dialogue,  and  the  U.S.–
China  Joint  Commission  on  Commerce  and  Trade.  Such  dialogues  provide  a  mean-
ingful forum to address emerging concerns as well as identify areas of mutual inter-
est where collaboration is ripe.

With  respect  to  the  IEC  process  and  related  issues,  UL  believes  that  the  United
States should work first to identify solutions, to the maximum extent possible, with-
in  the  international  standards  development  processes.  There  are  several  initiatives
underway within the standards community that allow for the exchange of ideas and
the introduction of change. Within the IEC these initiatives are carried out through
the  United  States  National  Committee  to  the  IEC.  Only  if  these  mechanisms  fail
to  achieve  resolutions  should  the  United  States  consider  raising  IEC-related  issues
in government-to-government dialogues.
Funding the DOC Standards Liaison Office:

The  office  of  the  DOC  Standards  Liaison  has  done  a  commendable  job  of  improv-
ing coordination across departments within DOC in a very short time. Collaborating
with  other  DOC  colleagues  has  also  enabled  pilot  training  programs  for  U.S.  Gov-
ernment  officials  on  standards  and  conformity  assessment  issues  as  they  affect
trade. Such training is paramount as the intersection between standards and trade
is increasing.

But  a  lot  of  work  remains  undone,  and  UL  would  like  to  see  more  meaningful
funding  for  execution  of  the  Standards  Liaison’s  mandate.  The  pilot  training  pro-
grams  indeed  are  commendable,  but  a  more  comprehensive  and  regular  program  is
needed  to  ensure  that  the  ever  evolving  and  rotating  cadre  of  U.S.  trade  officials
become proficient in standards and trade issues.

Careful  consideration  should  also  be  given  to  funding  of  additional  Standards
Attache´s  in  overseas  posts.  Such  attaches  have  played  pivotal  roles  in  facilitating

resolution  of  standards  and  conformity  assessment  issues  faced  by  manufacturers
and  conformity  assessment  providers  alike.  Their  ability  to  track  trends  and  report
on  them  makes  it  easier  for  industry  to  uncover  signs  of  emerging  problems  and  to
address them earlier rather than later.
Increasing Funding for Existing Government Standards Programs:

• NIST  Standards  in  Trade  (SIT)  Workshops:  UL  has  been  a  longstanding  ac-
tive  participant  in  the  NIST  SIT  workshops.  These  workshops  prove  a  valu-
able  venue  through  which  interested  U.S.  private  sector  organizations  can
educate  foreign  government  officials  on  the  U.S.  standards  and  certification
system and build bridges for future cooperation. These broad and specific pro-
grams  are  especially  important  when  they  target  countries/regions  in  which
systems/structures currently do not exist or are in their infancy, and in which
there  is  a  perceived  receptivity  to  U.S.  principles  and  practices.  We  believe
that  the  impact  of  these  workshops  could  be  strengthened  through  increased
funding that would enable NIST to continue offering new programs while pro-
viding a mechanism to sustain momentum of previous programs.

• Commercial  Law  and  Development  Program  (CLDP):  Funding  for  standards
and conformity assessment related programs under the auspices of the CLDP
program are also valued. Having participated in a number of these programs
over the years, UL believes that these programs also help advance U.S. com-
mercial  and  public  safety  interests  over  the  long-term.  Sustained  funding  is
warranted.

Preserving Safety and Facilitating Trade

In  the  end,  globalization  will  place  pressure  on  standards  and  conformity  assess-
ment  systems  to  streamline  and  harmonize.  The  merits  of  such  harmonization  are
real, but doing so needs to be executed in a manner that does not sacrifice the high
level of product safety enjoyed in the United States today.

Standards  should  continue  to  be  driven  by  market  needs  and  developed  through
open  processes.  At  the  international  level,  U.S.  stakeholders  need  to  find  ways  to
inject  greater  balance  into  the  IEC  process,  working  through  its  technical  commit-
tees and governance bodies.

Encouraging  trading  partners  to  provide  national  treatment  to  U.S.-domiciled
testing and certification organizations helps U.S. manufacturers reduce costs of com-
pliance  by  minimizing  duplicative  testing  requirements  and  enables  a  global  ap-
proach  to  conformance.  Reduction  of  manufacturers’  costs  will  help  U.S.  exporters
remain competitive abroad and address some pressure points that drive U.S. compa-
nies to shift production overseas.

In all of these areas, the U.S. Government has a real and meaningful role to play.
UL and other private sector stakeholders look forward to working with all divisions
of the U.S. Government to advance U.S. interests and minimize the adverse impact
of  standards,  technical  regulations,  and  conformity  assessment  processes  on  trade.

Chairman EHLERS. Thank you.
Mr. Karmol.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  DAVID  KARMOL,  VICE  PRESIDENT,  PUB-
LIC  POLICY  AND  GOVERNMENT  AFFAIRS,  AMERICAN  NA-
TIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE
Mr.  KARMOL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Wu,

and Representative Biggert. I am pleased to be here.

I  am  David  Karmol.  I  am  Vice  President  of  Public  Policy  and
Government Affairs for the American National Standards Institute.
As you know, ANSI is the coordinator of the U.S. private sector-
led and public sector-supported voluntary consensus standards and
conformity  assessment  system.  We  share  the  concerns  of  industry
and  this  committee  about  the  ramification  of  standards  and  regu-
latory  activities  on  American  businesses  competing  in  the  global
marketplace.

In our testimony, ANSI will suggest actions that can be taken by
the  Congress  to  help  mitigate  concerns  related  to  the  standardiza-
tion policies and practices of China and the European Union.

My  first  point  will  address  considerations  with  respect  to  the
People’s  Republic  of  China.  As  the  world’s  largest  contract  manu-
facturer  and  the  world’s  largest  single  market,  it  is  critical  that
China  be  persuaded  to  participate  in  international  standards  fo-
rums  and  to  embrace  the  globally-accepted  principles  of  standard-
ization endorsed by the World Trade Organization.

Events of the past few years indicate that China may have been
considering a strategy of using national standards as trade barriers
to  shelter  its  growing  industries.  China  must  be  encouraged  to
adopt  existing  and  globally-recognized  voluntary  standards  rather
than develop unique standards for use only in that country.

To avoid future ‘‘WAPI’’ situations, companies in China should be
urged  to  consider  offering  the  inclusion  of  intellectual  property  in
globally-recognized  standards  under  reasonable  and  non-discrimi-
natory  terms  and  conditions  in  the  same  manner  as  they  are  used
in the United States’ standards.

Finally,  China  should  be  encouraged  to  adopt  the  WTO  TBT
agreement  definition  of  ‘‘international  standard’’  that  includes  doc-
uments  that  have  been  developed  by  a  consensus-based  organiza-
tion that follows transparent policies that are balanced, reasonable,
and non-discriminatory.

The  Chinese  government  recently  completed  an  investigation  of
its  standards  system,  identifying  problems  and  suggesting  solu-
tions. ANSI has praised these efforts and continues to support Chi-
nese leaders to adopt a standards process that is marketplace-driv-
en.

My next point will address considerations with respect to the Eu-

ropean Union and the European standards organizations.

European  standards  are  often  developed  to  meet  specific  regu-
latory  requirements  or  procurement  policies.  A  standard  that  is
adopted  by  the  European  Union  must  also  become  the  normative
document  for  each  EU  member  nation.  With  few  exceptions,  the
three European regional standards organizations restrict participa-
tion  on  their  standard-setting  committees  to  entities  that  have  a
physical presence in an EU member state.

ANSI believes that the European standards organizations should
allow  U.S.  stakeholders  to  participate  in  the  development  of  EU
standards  that  will  ultimately  impact  their  ability  to  trade  in  the
European market. We have had bilateral discussions annually with
representatives  of  the  European  Commission  and  European  stand-
ards  organizations,  and  we  encourage  them,  and  continue  to  en-
courage them, to open their doors to U.S. stakeholders.

Recently, the EU and its member nations have begun expending
millions of Euros annually to provide technical assistance to devel-
oping  and  emerging  nations,  including  China.  These  efforts  often
include providing free standards and even translations of standards
in return for commitments by the recipient nations to adopt or oth-
erwise  use  the  EU  standards.  To  date,  the  U.S.  standardization
community  has  not  had  the  resources  to  offset  this  aggressive  ef-
fort.

The  strengthening  of  U.S.  Federal  Government  support  of  and
cooperation  with  the  private  sector  is  needed  for  standards  edu-
cation  and  outreach  activities,  technical  support  and  assistance,
and  resources  to  assure  adequate  U.S.  representation  at  inter-
national  standards  meetings.  To  facilitate  stronger  U.S.  coordina-
tion,  ANSI  recently  offered  its  Regional  Standing  Committee  for
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa as a focal point to improve co-
ordination  between  government  agencies  and  the  private  sector  in
the areas of representation, technical assistance, and outreach and
other related aspects of trade and regulatory policy.

My last point will address coordinating public and private sector

The  policy  considerations  put  forth  in  this  testimony  are  aligned
with  high-level  strategies  developed  by  the  U.S.  Department  of
Commerce,  as  expressed  in  former  Secretary  Evans’  ‘‘Standards  in
Competitiveness—Coordinating  for  Results’’  document.  They  are
also  aligned  with  the  latest  edition  of  the  draft  ‘‘United  States
Standards  Strategy,’’  which  is  now  being  developed  by  members  of
the  U.S.  standardization  community  in  a  process  that  ANSI  is
managing.

Mr.  Joe  Bhatia  to  my  right  chairs  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy
Project.  The  other  witnesses  here  today  have  also  provided  valu-
able  input  throughout  the  development  of  this  strategy.  We  would
be pleased to respond to your questions about it.

In  summary,  the  strategy  provides  a  framework  to  address  the
cross-border trade of goods and services as well as key national pri-
orities, such as homeland security and emerging technologies. Con-
gressional  recognition  and  endorsement  of  the  strategy  would  pro-
vide  valuable  support  to  the  private  sector  as  it  engages  with  Eu-
rope  and  China.  ANSI  asks  you,  as  members  of  the  House  Science
Committee,  to  offer  a  resolution  endorsing  the  U.S.  Standards
Strategy when it is finalized. Such a resolution would demonstrate
to  other  nations  that  the  U.S.  speaks  with  one  voice  on  standards
issues, even though our development of standards takes advantage
of a decentralized and sector-based approach.

I  thank  you  for  your  consideration,  welcome  your  questions,  and

strategies.

ask that my full statement be made a part of the record.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID KARMOL

Introduction

‘‘If you control an industry’s standards, you control that industry lock, stock, and
ledger.’’ That prophetic statement was made more than ten years ago by Dr. W. Ed-
wards Deming, father of the quality movement that has transformed the ways com-
panies do business both here and abroad.

Today,  standardization1 has  become  the  key  to  market  access.  When  standards
and  conformity  assessment  related  policies  and  practices  differ  from  country  to
country,  or  when  standards  are  used  as  barriers  to  trade,  businesses  are  unable  to
compete  effectively  in  the  global  marketplace.  These  challenges  are  being  faced
around the globe—country by country—on a daily basis.

The  United  States  Department  of  Commerce  reports  that  many  businesses  now
view standardization and regulatory issues as their major impediment to increasing
exports. Of particular concern are the standards-related activities of the People’s Re-
public of China (hereinafter referred to as either ‘‘PRC’’ or ‘‘China’’) and the member
nations  of  the  European  Union  (EU),  each  of  which  have  significant  ramifications
for American firms that wish to export to those markets or who wish to source man-
ufacturing there.

As administrator and coordinator of the United States’ private sector-led and pub-
lic  sector-supported  voluntary  consensus  standardization  system,  the  American  Na-
tional  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)  shares  the  concerns  of  industry  and  this  com-
mittee vis-a´-vis our nation’s ability to compete effectively in world economies. A key
element  of  ANSI’s  mission  is  focused  on  enhancing  the  global  competitiveness  of
U.S.  business  by  facilitating  voluntary  consensus  standards  (VCS)  and  conformity
assessment systems, and safeguarding their integrity.

In  this  testimony,  ANSI  will  explain  many  of  its  relevant  standardization  activi-
ties related to China and the EU and will recommend actions that can be taken by
Congress to assist in mitigating many of the concerns identified. ANSI will also call
for  Congressional  endorsement  of  the  United  States  Standards  Strategy2 (USSS)  as
a framework that effectively addresses the cross-border trade of goods and services;
key  national  priorities  such  as  homeland  security;  emerging  technologies—such  as
nanotechnology—and their significant related commercial and business applications;
consumer health and safety, and more.

Mr.  Joe  Bhatia,  who  is  appearing  here  today  on  behalf  of  Underwriters  Labora-
tories,  chairs  the  USSS  project.  Robert  Noth,  Donald  Deutsch,  and  Dr.  Hratch
Semerjian  and  his  staff  at  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology
(NIST)  all  provided  invaluable  input  and  leadership  throughout  the  development
process of the Strategy. All of us will be pleased to respond to your questions about
it.

In  addition,  ANSI  will  call  for  strengthened  federal  support  of,  and  cooperation
with, the private sector for activities such as research, education, and technical sup-
port,  and  resources  to  assure  adequate  U.S.  representation  at  international  stand-
ards  meetings.  These  actions  will  help  to  level  the  playing  field  for  U.S.  businesses
competing in the international marketplace.
Considerations with Respect to the People’s Republic of China (PRC)

Events of the past few years indicate that stakeholders within the PRC may have
been considering a strategy of using national standards as trade barriers to shelter
the Nation’s growing industries. However, the role of the PRC as the world’s largest
contract manufacturer makes it critical that China be persuaded to continue its par-
ticipation  in  international  standards  forums,  rather  than  develop  unique  national
standards.  This  is  especially  important  in  those  instances  where  the  intellectual
property  rights  that  are  often  incorporated  into  standards  are  not  made  available
on the basis of reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

During  2004,  the  PRC  government  completed  its  own  investigation  of  its  stand-
ards  system,  identifying  problems  and  suggesting  solutions.  The  issuance  of  these
strategy  reports  and  the  seemingly  positive  content  identifying  internal  changes  to
be made to the PRC standardization system has been applauded by ANSI.

1 ‘‘Standardization’’ encompasses a broad range of considerations such as which (whose) stand-
ards will be used, laboratory accreditation, certification of products, services, and personnel, me-
trology and measurement, testing and sampling.

2 The  United  States  Standards  Strategy  (draft  second  edition)  is  an  update  of  the  National
Standards  Strategy  for  the  United  States  (first  edition—August  2000).  It  is  being  developed  by
representatives  of  various  industry  sectors,  including  small,  medium  and  large  organizations,
consortia,  professional  societies,  trade  associations,  labor  unions,  consumer  and  consumer  rep-
resentative  organizations,  educational  institutions,  Federal  and  State  government  regulators,
and legislators and staff.

ANSI has offered its support in reforming the PRC standards system and will en-
courage support of a process that is driven by marketplace demand where standards
are developed in response to specific concerns and needs expressed by industry, gov-
ernment, and consumers (see Annex B).

To  assist  in  the  mitigation  of  concerns  about  the  Chinese  standardization  policy,
ANSI  offers  the  following  policy  considerations  for  review  and  deliberation  by  the
Science Committee of the United States House of Representatives and for consider-
ation by stakeholders in the PRC:

• The  global  economy  will  be  best  served  if  the  PRC  joins  with  the  United
States  and  other  nations  in  embracing  the  globally  accepted  principles  of
standardization  endorsed  by  the  WTO  (see  Annex  C).  In  particular,  support
should  be  given  to  open  and  inclusive  participation  in  standardization  activi-
ties;  balancing  the  interests  of  all  stakeholder  groups  so  that  the  outcomes
are  representative  and  broadly  supported;  and  maximizing  the  participation
of, and value to, both intellectual property rights (IPR) holders and implemen-
ters.

• Voluntary  consensus  standards  enable  industry  growth,  promote  vendor  dif-
ferentiation  and  allow  for  adaptation  to  meet  unique  consumer  and  stake-
holder  needs.  To  the  extent  that  the  PRC  adopts  existing  and  globally  recog-
nized  voluntary  standards—rather  than  developing  unique  standards  for  use
only in China—the Nation and its growing export market will benefit.

• The  inclusion  of  intellectual  property,  under  reasonable  and  non-discrimina-
tory (RAND) terms and conditions, in voluntary consensus standards provides
benefit to the contributor of that intellectual property via licenses and/or rec-
ognition and to implementers of the standard via the reduced need to support
multiple specifications. Companies in China are encouraged to consider offer-
ing intellectual property for inclusion in globally recognized standards.
• The global landscape is rich with entities, systems and processes that support
regional and international standardization activities. These include treaty or-
ganizations where governments are members; non-treaty organizations whose
membership  is  comprised  of  national  representatives;  professional  and  tech-
nical  organizations  whose  membership  is  on  an  individual  or  organizational
basis; and through consortia whose membership is typically company and in-
dustry based.

— The  PRC  will  benefit  by  broadening  its  definition  of  ‘‘international
standard’’ to include documents that have been either developed or rati-
fied  by  any  consensus-based  organization  pursuant  to  transparent  poli-
cies  that  are  reasonable  and  non-discriminatory.  China’s  current  defini-
tion  is  limiting  in  that  it  applies  only  to  standards  that  have  been  ap-
proved  by  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO),
International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC),  and  the  International
Telecommunication Union (ITU).

— As  a  means  of  fostering  both  competition  and  innovation,  governments
in  all  nations  should  allow  stakeholders,  particularly  companies,  to
choose among the different voluntary standards that may be applicable.

Considerations  with  Respect  to  the  European  Union  and  the  European

Standards Organizations

Similar  to  the  United  States,  the  European  Union  and  its  member  nations  have
increased  their  reliance  on  standards  developed  under  a  voluntary  consensus  proc-
ess. Unfortunately, the similarities often end here.

In  the  U.S.,  a  standard  is  generally  developed  in  response  to  market  demand  or
need.  Standards  in  Europe  are  often  developed  to  fill  a  government  need  for  a  spe-
cific set of regulatory requirements or procurement policies of government agencies.
A  standard  that  is  adopted  by  the  EU  must  become  the  normative  document  for
each of the EU member nations. With few exceptions, the three European Standards
Organizations—the  European  Committee  on  Standardization  (CEN),  the  European
Committee  on  Electrotechnical  Standardization  (CENELEC),  and  the  European
Telecommunications  Standards  Institute  (ETSI)—restrict  participation  on  their
standards-setting committees to entities that have a physical presence in one of the
EU member nations.

To assist in the mitigation of concerns about the EU standardization policy, ANSI
offers  the  following  policy  considerations  for  review  and  deliberation  by  the  Science
Committee  of  the  United  States  House  of  Representatives  and  for  consideration  by
stakeholders in Europe:

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

48

• Some  access  to  the  ESOs  is  available  via  the  role  of  ANSI  and  its  U.S.  Na-
tional  Committee  of  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (USNC/
IEC)  as  the  U.S.  member  of  the  ISO  and  IEC,  respectively.  An  ANSI  delega-
tion engages regularly with representatives of the European Commission and
the ESOs to raise strategic standards issues from the U.S. perspective. ANSI
will continue to pursue an expansion of the ESO’s participation requirements
to  provide  for  the  ability  of  U.S.  stakeholders  to  influence  the  development
of  EU  standards  that  will  ultimately  impact  their  ability  to  trade  with  the
European market.

• At the same time that the EU and its member nations have become more ag-
gressive  in  producing  standards  that  serve  EU  producers,  they  have  also
begun expending millions of Euros annually to provide technical assistance to
developing and emerging nations, including China. These efforts often include
providing  free  standards,  and  even  translations  of  standards,  in  return  for
commitments  by  the  recipient  nations  to  adopt  or  otherwise  use  the  EU
standards. While some U.S. standards developers and companies have aggres-
sively  promoted  their  catalogues  of  standards  to  emerging  nations,  to  date
neither  U.S.  industry  nor  government  has  been  willing  or  able  to  make  con-
tributions that will offset this imbalance.

— The  U.S.  standardization  community  does  not  have  the  resources  to
match the large investment being made by the Europeans. Federal Gov-
ernment  support  of,  and  cooperation  with,  the  private  sector  is  needed
for activities such as research, education, and technical support, and re-
sources  to  assure  adequate  U.S.  representation  at  international  stand-
ards meetings.

— These  U.S.  outreach  and  promotion  efforts  must  be  well  coordinated.
ANSI  offers  its  Regional  Standing  Committee  for  Europe,  the  Middle
East and Africa (RSC–EMEA) 3 as a focal point to improve coordination
between  private  sector  interests,  and  governmental  interests  in  the
areas of trade and regulatory policy, which involve different government
agencies and participants.

Coordinating Public and Private Sector Strategies

The above policy considerations for China and Europe are aligned with high-level
strategies developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce following the issuance in
May  2004  of  ‘‘Standards  and  Competitiveness—Coordinating  for  Results,’’  a  report
acknowledging the growing awareness of standards as a key trade issue. These con-
siderations are also aligned with the latest edition of the draft United States Stand-
ards Strategy (USSS) (www.ansi.org/usss). A key aspect of the Strategy is reference
to  the  requirements  of  the  WTO’s  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  as  related  to  stand-
ards practices.

As referenced in the Introduction of this testimony, the USSS is a guidance docu-
ment  that  is  being  developed  by  members  of  the  U.S.  standardization  community,
including representatives of industry,4 government, consumers, academia and more.
It  is  a  perfect  example  of  the  U.S.  public-private  sector  partnership  approach  to
standardization.

• The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  is  expected  to  be  finalized  in  late  2005.  Imple-
mentation of its strategic initiatives and tactics will be strengthened by Con-
gressional  recognition  and  endorsement.  This  endorsement  will  also  provide
valuable support to the private sector as it engages with Europe and the var-
ious standards organizations in China.

— ANSI  encourages  the  Science  Committee  to  offer  a  resolution  or  other
legislative  vehicle  to  enable  the  Congress  to  formally  endorse  the  U.S.
Standards Strategy.

3 ANSI  established  the  RSC–EMEA  to  broaden  the  participation  of  U.S.  stakeholders  in  the
development  of  policy  positions  regarding  regional  standards  and  conformity  assessment  activi-
ties, and to coordinate U.S. activities, respond to initiatives and advise ANSI on matters relating
to the European, Middle Eastern and African regions.

4 Representatives  of  the  National  Association  of  Manufacturers  (NAM)  have  been  actively  in-
volved in the process of updating the U.S. Standards Strategy; William Primosch, NAM’s senior
director  of  international  business  policy,  headed  the  working  group  drafting  the  international

Summary

The  American  National  Standards  Institute  is  proceeding  with  its  plans  to  assist
in reforming the PRC standards system, working with Europe in establishing a level
playing  field  for  U.S.  stakeholders,  and  finalizing  and  implementing  the  United
States Standards Strategy.

On behalf of its members, constituents, and the U.S. standardization community,
the Institute will continue to serve as an advocate for an open, balanced and trans-
parent  global  standards  system  that  is  driven  by  marketplace  demand.  ANSI  will
also encourage China, the EU and its members, and all other nations to pursue the
development,  endorsement  and  adoption  of  globally  recognized  standards  that  re-
spond  to  specific  concerns  and  that  meet  the  needs  expressed  by  all  stakeholders.
ANSI welcomes the opportunity to continue to work in partnership with this com-
mittee,  Congress,  and  other  U.S.  public  sector  representatives  to  achieve  these
goals.

Background on the U.S. Standardization System and the Role of the Amer-

ican National Standards Institute (ANSI)

The  U.S.  private  sector-led,  voluntary  standardization  system  has  been  in  exist-
ence for more than 100 years. It is a highly decentralized system and naturally par-
titioned into industrial sectors that are supported by numerous independent, private
sector  standards  developing  organizations  (SDOs).  It  is  a  system  that  is  demand-
driven by the marketplace with standards typically developed in response to specific
concerns and needs expressed by industry, government, and consumers.

Since  1918,  this  system  has  been  administered  and  coordinated  by  the  American
National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)  with  the  cooperation  of  the  private  sector  and
the Federal, State and local governments. ANSI does not develop standards. Rather,
it functions as a central clearinghouse and coordinating body for its member organi-
zations.  The  Institute  is  a  unique  partnership  of  industry,  professional,  technical,
trade, labor, academic and consumer organizations, as well as government agencies.
These members of the ANSI federation actually develop standards or otherwise par-
ticipate in their development, contributing their time and expertise in order to make
the system work.

ANSI ensures the integrity of the U.S. standards system by:

1. establishing  a  set  of  due  process-based  ‘‘essential  requirements’’  that  SDOs
may follow in order to manage the consensus standards development process
in a fair and open manner,

2. accrediting SDOs who adhere to these requirements,
3. approving candidate standards from ANSI-accredited SDOs as American Na-

tional Standards (ANS), and

4. conducting  regular  audits  of  the  ANS  activities  of  ANSI-accredited  SDOs  to

ensure ongoing compliance with ANSI’s essential requirements.

ANSI  has  accredited  hundreds  of  SDOs  across  a  range  of  industry  sectors.  These
industries include (but certainly are not limited to) telecommunications, medical de-
vices,  heavy  equipment,  fire  protection,  information  technology,  petroleum,  banking
and  household  appliances.  There  are  now  approximately  10,000  ANSI-approved
ANS that address topics as diverse as dimensions, ratings, terminology and symbols,
test  methods,  inter-operability  criteria,  product  specifications,  and  performance  and
safety  requirements.  These  standards  development  efforts  serve  the  public  interest
and  are  being  applied  to  new  critical  areas  such  as  the  environment,  healthcare,
homeland security and nanotechnology.

The Institute’s approval of a candidate standard as an ANS verifies that the prin-
ciples  of  openness  and  due  process  have  been  followed  and  that  a  consensus  of  all
interested parties has been reached. Due process requires that all proposed ANS be
circulated  to  the  public  at  large  for  comment,  that  an  attempt  be  made  to  resolve
all  comments,  and  that  there  is  a  right  of  appeal.  In  addition,  ANSI  considers  any
evidence that a proposed ANS is contrary to the public interest, contains unfair pro-
visions  or  is  unsuitable  for  national  use.  This  basic  formula  has  been  the  hallmark
of  the  ANS  process  for  decades,  and  it  has  garnered  worldwide  respect  and  accept-
ance.

One of the best indicators of confidence in the U.S. voluntary consensus standard-
ization  system  (as  exemplified  by  the  ANS  process)  is  Congress’s  1996  passage  of
the  National  Technology  Transfer  and  Advancement  Act  (NTTAA).  This  law  (P.L.
104–113)  requires  federal  agencies  to  use  voluntary  consensus  standards  for  regu-
latory purposes wherever feasible and to procure equipment and services in accord-
ance  with  such  standards.  It  also  requires  agencies  to  increase  their  participation
in voluntary consensus standards activities and directs the Commerce Department’s
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  to  coordinate  federal,  State
and local voluntary standards and related conformity assessment activities.

ANSI  also  promotes  the  use  of  U.S.  standards  internationally.  The  Institute
serves  as  the  U.S.  national  body  representative  in  two  major,  non-treaty  inter-
national  standards  organizations:  the  International  Organization  for  Standardiza-
tion  (ISO)  and,  through  the  United  States  National  Committee  (USNC),  the  Inter-
national Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). ANSI and the USNC play a leadership
role in ISO and IEC, respectively, on both policy and technical matters.

Part of ANSI’s role as the U.S. member of ISO includes accrediting U.S. Technical
Advisory Groups (U.S. TAGs) which develop and transmit, via ANSI, U.S. consensus
positions  on  the  activities  and  ballots  of  technical  committees  and  subcommittees.
Similarly,  the  USNC  approves  TAGs  for  IEC  activities.  In  many  instances,  vol-

51

untary  standards  developed  by  U.S.  SDOs  are  taken  forward,  through  ANSI  or  the
USNC, where they are approved in whole or in part by the ISO and/or IEC as Inter-
national  Standards.  ANSI  also  encourages  the  adoption  of  international  standards
as national standards where they meet the needs of the user community.

In addition, ANSI advocates U.S. positions in various regional standards organiza-
tions  and  regularly  meets  with  representatives  from  standards  bodies  in  other  na-
tions.  Thus,  ANSI  plays  an  important  role  in  facilitating  the  development  of  global
standards that support global commerce and which prevent regions from using local
standards that favor local industries as trade barriers.

Conformity assessment is the term used to describe steps taken by both manufac-
turers  and  independent  third-parties  to  determine  fulfillment  of  standards  require-
ments. ANSI’s role in the conformity assessment arena includes accreditation of or-
ganizations that certify that products and personnel meet recognized standards. The
ANSI–American Society for Quality National Accreditation Board (ANAB) serves as
the U.S. accreditation body for management systems certification, primarily in areas
such  as  quality  (ISO  9000  family  of  standards)  and/or  the  environment  (ISO  14000
family of standards). ANSI also is involved in several international and regional or-
ganizations  to  promote  multilateral  recognition  of  conformity  assessments  across
borders to preclude redundant and costly barriers to trade.

In  summary,  through  its  various  roles  and  responsibilities,  ANSI  advances  its
mission  to  ‘‘enhance  both  the  global  competitiveness  of  U.S.  business  and  the  U.S.
quality of life by promoting and facilitating voluntary consensus standards and con-
formity assessment systems and safeguarding their integrity.’’

Annex B

Background on Standards and Trade with China

As  the  U.S.  member  body  of  ISO,  and  via  the  U.S.  National  Committee  of  IEC,
ANSI  serves  as  the  national  standards  body  counterpart  to  the  PRC  and  can  help
influence  Chinese  stakeholders  to  participate  in  the  fair  and  open  standardization
process  that  has  as  its  goal  the  development  of  a  single  set  of  globally  recognized
and accepted standards.

As noted earlier in this testimony, recent events indicate that the PRC may have
been considering using standards to establish trade barriers as a strategy to shelter
the Nation’s growing industries. One well-publicized example is related to the PRC’s
domestic  high-technology  industry  and  the  issue  of  a  Wireless  Local  Area  Network
(WLAN)  Authentication  and  Privacy  Infrastructure  (WAPI)  and  Wireless  Fidelity
(Wi-Fi) chips, the devices that allow computers to access the Internet through local
wireless networks.

On May 12, 2003, the PRC government mandated that a new WLAN WAPI secu-
rity  standard  take  effect  in  June  2004.  The  new  standard  was  developed  independ-
ently by the PRC Broadband Wireless IP Standard (BWIPS) Group with little or no
communication  with  other  standards  organizations  and  no  foreign  participation.
Upon  implementation  of  the  PRC  government  directive,  foreign  importers  to  China
would  have  been  mandated  to  comply  with  a  requirement  to  form  joint  ventures
with  one  of  24  PRC  companies  that  had  been  given  proprietary  technical  informa-
tion required for implementation of the WAPI standard.

The  U.S.  Government  and  industry  pointed  out  that  there  is  already  an  inter-
nationally accepted standard for such technology (IEEE 802.11). On March 2, 2004,
in a joint letter signed by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, U.S. Commerce Sec-
retary  Don  Evans  and  U.S.  Trade  Representative  Robert  Zoellick  to  Zeng  Peiyan,
Vice Premier of the People’s Republic of China, the Bush administration urged PRC
to drop WAPI. Following high-level meetings in Washington, D.C., the PRC govern-
ment  announced  that  it  would  (a)  suspend  implementation  of  the  WAPI  standard,
(b)  work  to  revise  the  WAPI  standard,  taking  into  account  comments  received  from
PRC  and  foreign  firms,  and  (c)  participate  in  international  standards  bodies  on
WAPI and wireless encryption for computer networks.

In  recent  months,  ANSI  has  worked  through  international  forums,  its  member-
ship,  and  in  concert  with  the  China  desk  at  the  Department  of  Commerce’s  Inter-
national Trade Administration to invite representatives of the PRC standards orga-
nizations to a meeting to discuss a long-term resolution of the WAPI issue, including
fair consideration of the PRC proposal in the appropriate international forum. ANSI
believes  that  respectful  and  open  engagement  with  the  various  PRC  standards
groups is the best way to resolve such issues going forward.

While  WAPI  is  important  for  many  reasons,  the  PRC  is  also  developing  several
other important (but locally divergent) standards in areas as diverse as the Internet
Protocol,  3G  wireless  communications  (such  as  TD  SCDMA5 and  SCDMA6),  audio-
video  capture  and  playback  (AVS),  document  and  data  protection,  the  small  intel-
ligent  grouping  and  resource  sharing  (IGRS)  for  terminal  device  collaboration  radio
devices being developed for inventory management (RFID), and others. It is the per-
vasive  nature  of  these  activities,  and  the  related  treatment  of  intellectual  property,
that is of significant concern to PRC’s trading partners.

Subsequent to the initial WAPI controversy, the PRC government issued a report
identifying  concerns  in  the  PRC  standards  system  and  suggesting  solutions.  The
study  was  a  cooperative  effort  between  the  Chinese  Ministry  of  Science  and  Tech-
nology (MoST), the Chinese General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspec-
tion  and  Quarantine  (AQSIQ),  and  the  Standardization  Administration  of  China
(SAC). The report itself was drafted by the China National Institute of Standardiza-
tion  (CNIS),  an  agency  within  the  AQSIQ,  which  met  with  an  ANSI  delegation  in
Washington, D.C. in December 2003.

The report suggested:

• changing the existing four levels of: National, Vertical, Local, and Enterprise
standards  to  the  three  levels  of:  National,  Association,  and  Enterprise  stand-
ards;

5 Time  Division  Synchronous  Code  Division  Multiple  Access  (TD–SCDMA)  is  a  mobile  tele-
phone standard for wireless network operators who want to move from a second generation (2G)
wireless network to a third-generation (3G) one.

• changing  the  two  categories  of  standards:  Mandatory  and  Recommended
standards into only voluntary standards; voluntary standards becoming man-
datory only via references or citations in government regulations;
• changing  the  standards  development  accreditation  scheme:  Currently,  na-
tional,  vertical  and  local  standards  are  subject  to  government  approval.  The
suggestion is to change this system so that: governmentally accredited bodies
will  approve  national  standards  and  associations  will  approve  association
standards;
• that enterprises should be free to determine their own standards usage with-
• that standards should be adopted voluntarily by the users of standards.

out the governmental registration required today;

The  issuance  of  the  SAC  strategy  reports,  and  the  seemingly  positive  content
identifying internal changes to be made to the PRC standardization system, prompt-
ed ANSI to send a letter to the Administrator of SAC, Li Zhonghai, in October 2004.
This  letter  congratulated  SAC  on  the  undertaking  of  this  study  and  applauded  the
recommendations put forward in the report.

To  further  its  outreach  efforts,  in  mid-January  2005  ANSI’s  President  and  Chief
Executive  Officer  Dr.  Mark.  W.  Hurwitz,  traveled  to  China  to  meet  with  Adminis-
trator  Li  and  representatives  of  CNIS,  the  Administration  of  Certification  and  Ac-
creditation of China (CNCA), the Standards Press of China (SPC) and the U.S. For-
eign Commercial Service in Beijing. During these discussions, ANSI agreed to serve
as the distributor of Chinese national standards in the U.S. and SAC agreed to be-
come  a  distributor  of  American  National  Standards,  as  well  as  certain  other  stand-
ards  developed  by  U.S.-based  standards-setting  bodies,  in  China.  This  arrangement
will facilitate access to the national standards of each nation and is seen as crucial
to the promotion of cross-border trade.

ANSI  has  also  taken  steps  to  mitigate  the  difficulty  of  obtaining  entry  visas  for
Chinese  technical  experts  who  are  attempting  to  attend  meetings  of  international
standards  committees  in  the  United  States.  Among  the  actions  taken  was  publica-
tion  of  a  guidelines  document  that  provides  information  for  Chinese  technical  ex-
perts  and  for  the  administrators  and  officers  of  the  technical  committee  meetings
that  are  hosting  those  meetings;  ANSI  is  engaged  in  ongoing  discussions  of  this
topic with the U.S. Department of State and other relevant agencies.

Dr. Hurwitz also explored with SAC the prospect of increasing U.S. and other for-
eign  access  to  participation  on  standards-setting  committees  in  the  PRC.  Current
and proposed future options were discussed, with a strong indication being given to
ANSI  by  SAC  that  China  will  be  moving  away  from  its  past  practices  of  favoring
government-held  seats  on  its  national  standardization  committees  and  placing  re-
strictions and/or limits on open participation on these committees.

Finally,  during  his  visit  Dr.  Hurwitz  was  introduced  to  a  new  initiative  within
PRC  to  develop  a  Chinese  Standards  Strategy.  The  Strategy’s  goals  include  efforts
to  develop,  within  15  years,  ‘‘independently  self-proprietary  technical  standards
through  effective  measures,  so  as  to  improve  international  competitiveness  of  Chi-
na’s  technical  standards  and  therefore  increase  the  international  market  share  of
Chinese products.’’

Its  Guiding  Principles  bear  in  mind  the  goals  of  ‘‘new-stage  industrialization  and
comfortably-off  society,’’  focus  on  improvement  of  technical  standard  adaptability
and  competitiveness,  couple  standard  independence/innovation  with  international
norms,  integrate  governmental  instruction  and  market  orientation  with  enterprise
as the major player, and meet the strategic requirements of technological innovation
as well as industrial and trade development on technical standards.

In  the  near-term,  Chinese  strategic  goals  to  be  achieved  by  2010  include  the  for-
mation of a rather complete national technical standard system, putting the overall
technological  level  of  Chinese  standards  on  a  par  with  that  of  international  stand-
ards for key areas. By 2020, the PRC intends to upgrade its international standards
involvement  to  an  advanced  level,  putting  China  high  on  the  rank  of  international
standardization contributors.

Excerpt from the [draft] United States Standards Strategy

PRINCIPLES

It is well established in the community of nations that standards should meet so-
cietal  and  market  needs  and  should  not  be  developed  to  act  as  barriers  to  trade.
In approving the World Trade Organization Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement,
WTO  members  recognized  that  goal  and  established  globally  accepted  principles  as
a  framework  to  promote  cooperation  and  discourage  the  use  of  standards  as  trade
barriers. The U.S. standards system is based on the following set of globally accept-
ed principles for standards development.

• Transparency

Essential  information  regarding  standardization  activities  is  accessible  to  all
interested parties.

• Openness

Participation is open to all affected interests.

• Impartiality

No one interest dominates the process or is favored over another.

• Effectiveness and relevance

Standards  are  relevant  and  effectively  respond  to  regulatory  and  market
needs, as well as scientific and technological developments.

• Consensus

Decisions are reached through consensus among those affected.

• Performance-based

Standards  are  performance-based,  specifying  essential  characteristics  rather
than detailed designs where possible.

• Coherence

The process encourages coherence to avoid overlapping and conflicting stand-
ards.

• Due Process

Standards development accords with due process so that all views are consid-
ered and appeals are possible.

• Technical Assistance

Assistance  is  offered  to  developing  countries  in  the  formulation  and  applica-
tion of standards.

In addition, U.S. interests strongly agree that the process should be:

• Flexible, allowing the use of different methodologies to meet the needs of dif-

ferent technology and product sectors;

• Timely,  so  that  purely  administrative  matters  do  not  slow  down  the  work,

but meet market expectations; and

• Balanced among competing interests.

DISCUSSION

Chairman EHLERS. And it certainly will.
I  thank  all  of  you  for  excellent  testimony.  You  covered  the  spec-
trum  and  outlined  very  well  the  nature  of  the  problem,  at  least  as
I perceive it, and now to decide where we go from here.

Let me begin the question period, and I recognize myself for five

minutes.

Something  for  all  of  the  witnesses  to  answer,  and  I  have  often
heard  that  we  are  not,  as  a  nation,  playing  an  active  enough  role
in various ways, and so I would like each of you to respond to that.
Is  the  United  States  playing  a  strong  enough  role  in  international
standards-setting? And by that, I don’t mean just the U.S. Govern-
ment.  I  mean  the  whole  country.  And  in  your  answer,  if  you
could—if you think they are not playing a strong enough role, could
you  outline  for  me  what  you  think  would  be  the  top  three  actions
the United States should take to assert itself. And are these action
items for the Federal Government, for U.S. industry, or some other
entity?

Now  that  may  be  hard  to  do  for  all  of  you  in  five  minutes—in
a  total  of  five  minutes,  but  I  would  appreciate  reactions  you  give.
And  usually  we  go  in  the  same  order  we  ask  the  question,  but  I
would like to reverse it, just for variety’s sake.

And  Mr.  Karmol,  since  you  were  the  one  to  offer  some  concrete

suggestions, we will start with you.

Mr. KARMOL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I guess I will start by saying I think the United States does play
an  active  role,  and  I  appreciate  your  recognition  that  it  is  a  joint
effort  of  the  private  sector  and  government.  And  although  we  are
playing an active role, I think better coordination between the pri-
vate  sector  and  the  public  sector  would  benefit  our  participation.
Certainly stronger federal support, in terms of providing more out-
reach  and  support  for  standards  infrastructure  development  in
emerging  nations  would  be  helpful.  And  finally,  better  recognition
of  the  importance  of  standards,  which  you  can  help  by  raising  the
awareness  of  the  importance  of  standards,  you  and  the  Congress
and the Executive Branch would be helpful by encouraging compa-
nies  and  government  agencies  to  participate  actively  in  inter-
national standards-setting activities.

Chairman EHLERS. Thank you.
Mr. Bhatia.
Mr. BHATIA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

56

The development of the U.S. Standards Strategy, which is a proc-
ess that is coming near completion, will define actionable items. We
want  to  have  industry  and  government  step  up  to  the  plate  and
own up to their obligations to take certain initiatives and take cer-
tain  actions  to  support  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy.  We  feel  that
there  is  a  contribution  to  be  made  by  both  the  U.S.  Government
and  the  industry,  including  SDOs,  including  people  in  the  private
sector, including people in the industry.

With  regard  to  the  government  contributions,  we  feel  that  more
needs  to  be  done  by  Federal  Government  in  supporting  our  initia-
tives  overseas.  We  need  to  have  a  better  outreach  program,  better
education  program,  more  funding  of  initiatives  that  support  our
needs,  such  as  standards  attache´s  in  the  right  countries,  such  as
workshops in standardization, which allow us to explain and make
others  understand  the  good  features  and  acceptable  points  and
practices of our system, which also allows, ultimately, then the ac-
ceptance  of  our  products  in  those  markets.  I  feel  that  we  need  to
have SDOs, as well as private industry people, participate and rec-
ognize  the  value  and  the  economic  impact  that  standards  and  con-
formity  assessment  systems  have  on  our  business  practices  here
and globally.

So I urge you to stay tuned, because we will be spelling out spe-
cific  actions  and  will  be  looking  for  endorsement  from  various  par-
ties,  both  in  the  private  sector  and  the  government  agencies,  to
support  those  initiatives  that  would  be  beneficial  for  the  country.

Chairman EHLERS. Thank you.
Dr. Deutsch.
Dr. DEUTSCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
One  thing  that  I  think  we  have  heard  from  all  of  the  testimony
today  is  that  we  are  in  agreement  that  the  U.S.  standards  process
works.  It  has  served  our  industry  and  all  of  the  industries  rep-
resented  here  and  the  government  well.  So  you  have  asked  me  for
three things the government should do. I want to start out by say-
ing one thing the government should not do is become a standard-
setter  or  to  emulate  some  of  the  behavior  we  have  described  that
we are seeing outside the United States. We have a very well-func-
tioning, market-driven, diverse mechanism for setting standards in
the United States.

So  what  is  it  the  government  can  do  then?  And  basically,  I  will
go back to the three items I mentioned in my testimony. One is to
strengthen  the  current  standards  liaison  and  attache´ programs
that are already underway.

The  second  is  to  redouble  our  advocacy  efforts.  And  let  me  put
a  little  bit  of  meat  on  the  bones  of  that.  We  have  a  process  that
serves us well, but it is a complex process. And it is a difficult proc-
ess  to  understand.  So  it  is  a  lot  easier,  especially  for  an  emerging
economy,  to  understand  a  top-down,  government-driven  process
than it is to understand a disparate, diverse, and bottoms-up, mar-
ket-driven process like we have. It would really help if the govern-
ment,  in  its  relations  outside  the  United  States  became  a  strong
advocate for that. Okay.

And the third recommendation that I brought forward was some-
thing  which  is  not  yet  underway,  to  my  knowledge,  in  the  United
States  and  which  I  see  is  a  combination  of  government  and  indus-

try  working  together,  and  that  is  we  probably  would  benefit  from
having some metrics, some research that supported what is obvious
to us that the United States standardization process, in fact, bene-
fits society as a whole as well as industries and consumers.

Thank you very much.
Chairman EHLERS. Thank you.
Mr. Noth.
Mr. NOTH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is an excellent question.
I  don’t  think,  at  this  point  in  time,  that,  especially  in  the  small
and  medium-sized  enterprises  within  the  United  States,  there  is
enough industry participation in standards globally. There are a lot
of  very  intelligent  people  in  those  areas,  but  they  are  small.  They
don’t  have  a  lot  of  extra  funds.  They  don’t  fund  travel  to  inter-
national  organizations.  And  they  tend  to  have  a  mindset  that  sug-
gests that they should do what the customer wants and will follow
that. I don’t think they have a realization of what is going on, and
somehow  or  another  we  need  mechanisms  to  attract  them  and
make it aware that some of their competition in the future is going
to  come  from  offshore.  And  even  if  they  only  see  their  market  as
local  today,  their  competition  is  actually  coming  from  other  places
in the global world.

From  the  Federal  Government’s  perspective,  what  I  also  rec-
ommended  is  exactly  there.  I  think  the  Federal  Government  needs
to  step  up  with  better  alignment  across  the  agency  with  more  of
a policy of strategic focus to our activities and promote this. I think
that has impacts, because one of the areas we are having difficulty
getting  is  state  governments  to  understand  where  standards  play
in.  And  many  of  their  trade  missions,  and  what  have  you,  ignore
standards and the impacts of standards that they have, and in our
decentralized  society,  I  think  we  need  better  alignment  in  that
area.  And  our  leadership,  the  leadership  of  the  Congress,  would
have some impact on getting their attention.

Beyond that, it is providing stable funding and resources. And as
Mr. Deutsch and others have said, we need a strong advocacy, both
onshore  and  offshore,  from  our  extensions,  whether  they  be  State
or  Commerce  or  trade  missions  to  make  sure  that  we  are  advo-
cating  for  both  the  technology  and  the  standards  that  underpin
them from the United States.

them.

Chairman  EHLERS.  We  can  provide  more  questions  if  you  need

Dr.  SEMERJIAN.  Well,  one  of  the  things  that  wasn’t  mentioned
was  certainly  in  the  developing  markets,  such  as  China,  clearly
there is some education to be done. And we are making significant
efforts  in  that  regard  through  our  standards  and  trade  workshops,
for  example,  where  we  invite  standards  officials  and  the  decision-
makers to come to the United States and try to understand and be
exposed to our diverse, as described by others, system of standards.
And  I  think  that  is  very  important,  because  in  many  cases,  people
don’t really understand how things work in the United States. And

if  we  expect  them  to  endorse  and  adopt  some  of  our  ways,  I  think
we need to do a better job of educating and informing them of how
we operate.

Also, we need to make more of an effort to get them involved, go
out  of  our  way  to  get  them  involved  in  the  standards  process.  For
example,  we  have  some  NIST  staff  who  are  chairing  some  of  the
standards  committees  who  have,  on  purpose,  held  their  committee
meetings in China to facilitate the participation of Chinese officials
in  these  activities,  and  we  hope  that  if  they  participate  or  at  least
find  them  interesting,  hopefully  they  will  not—they  will  see  that
there is not necessarily a need for passing different and additional
standards as opposed to using existing ones.

So  there  are  a  couple  of  suggestions.  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of
ways of improving the situation. Unfortunately, I don’t think there
is  a  ‘‘silver  bullet’’  that  will  solve  all  of  our  problems.  I  think  we
need to work on all fronts.

Thank you.
Chairman  EHLERS.  Thank  you  all  for  the  good  answers.  They
stimulated  a  lot  more  questions  in  my  mind,  but  my  time  has  ex-
pired.

I am pleased to call on the gentleman from Oregon, Mr. Wu.
Mr. WU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First  of  all,  Dr.  Deutsch,  when  the  People’s  Republic  of  China
first  started  going  down  the  ‘‘WAPI’’  road  instead  of  standard  Wi-
fi,  my  impression  was  that  the  Commerce  Department  and  USTR
was  not  exactly  prompt  in  bringing  pressure  to  bear  on  the  Chi-
nese. Is that impression accurate?

Dr. DEUTSCH. I am sorry, Representative; I do not have personal
knowledge  of  the  initial  stages  of  that.  I  do  know  that  when  the
government  became  engaged  that  it  was  ultimately  effective.  I  do
think it took us a while to get not just the government but the pri-
vate sector focused on the reality of the issue.

Mr. WU. I somehow got the impression that there was a lag time,

a significant lag time, on the order of a year or more.

Dr.  DEUTSCH.  That  is  possible.  I  will  yield  to  some  of  my  col-

leagues here who may have had some immediate——

Mr. WU. No one is talking.
Mr. KARMOL. Mr. Wu, we would be happy to respond back to you.
I don’t know—have personal knowledge of that myself, but we have
people  in  our  organization  that  would  be  familiar  with  that  and
could give you a more complete answer.

Mr.  WU.  Sure  thing.  Thank  you,  Mr.—very  much,  Mr.  Karmol.
Mr.  Karmol  and  Dr.  Deutsch,  especially  Dr.  Deutsch,  I  hear  you
loud and clear about what the U.S. Federal Government should not
be  doing  with  respect  to  American  standards  setting.  What  I  am
very  curious  about  is  I  understand,  I  think,  what  you  would  like
to  see  in  the  international  arena.  I  am  at  a  loss,  at  least  at  this
moment,  to  think  of  what  possible  leverage  we  have  to  get  other
countries  to  adopt,  not  our  standards,  but  our  standards-setting
process.  Many  cultures  are  different.  Their  governments  are  dif-
ferent. They come from a different tradition, and perhaps the auto-
matic  thought  is  instead  of  having  a  competition  in  the  market-
place and voluntary standards, by golly, you know, we are going to
develop  a  regulatory  approach  to  this.  I—help  me  out  here.  I  just

59

don’t  see  how—this  is  like  pushing  on  a  string.  I  don’t  quickly  see
any leverage to get other societies to change the way in which they
set their standards. Do you have some in mind?

Dr. DEUTSCH. Well, if by leverage you mean a carrot and a stick,

Mr. WU. I have generally found that without sticks, carrots tend

okay——

not to be all that effective.

Dr.  DEUTSCH.  I  think—and  I  don’t  have  the  stick.  I  mean—but
I  do  think  the  most  significant  ‘‘carrot’’  is  how  well  our  system
serves—take my industry, the IT industry. This is an industry that
is  U.S.-dominated.  We  have  thrived  in  the  absence  of  government
intervention.  We  have  used  this  standardization  process  and
evolved  it,  over  time,  to  meet  our  time-to-market  requirements  to
meet  the  rapid  growth  of  the  IT  industry,  and  as  such,  not  only
have  our  companies,  you  know,  benefited,  but  society,  as  a  whole,
has  benefited  with  the  efficiency  and  the  productivity  in  our  econ-
omy, and that is why I suggest that I think a really good case could
be  made  that  our  approach  to  standardization  has  a  substantial
amount to do with the success of the economy in general of the IT
sector  in  particular  and  that  alternative  approaches  do  not  have
the same positive effect.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  I  am  not  so  much  disagreeing  with  you  as  just
thinking back to instances like beta videotapes and Apple software
versus  DOS  and  a  couple  of  other  instances  where,  you  know,  the
market  did  come  to  a  conclusion,  but  whether  the  market  came  to
the  best  technical  conclusion  or  not  is—it  is  still  a  question  open
to history, one would think.

Mr.  BHATIA.  I  think  your  question  is  very  insightful.  Clearly,
there  are  governments  out  there,  nations  out  there  that  will  never
be  comfortable  in  the  standards-setting  process  that  we  deploy  in
the  United  States.  It  has  to  have  a  structure  of  the  type  which  is
comparable.  And  constituency  build-up  and  contributions  from  dif-
ferent  groups  that  is  feasible  here  may  not  be  feasible  in  other
countries. But clearly, the opportunity to promote and educate oth-
ers to go out and celebrate, if you will, our successes openly to tell
them  about  the  benefits  that  we  accrue  from  this  system,  which  is
open,  which  is  market-relevant,  which  has  participatory  options,
which  has  impacts  that  are  analyzed  and  considered  and  technical
superiority  of  the  documents  that  are  often  produced  in  many  in-
dustry sectors: medical, aerospace, IT, you name it. There is indus-
try after industry, which is totally dependent on United States and
United States standardizations and documents to carry the flag.

I  think  we  need  to  get  that  message  out  there.  We  need  to  edu-
cate people early on. If we are not available to do this and the Eu-
ropeans  and  other  parts  of  the  globe  are  there  with  their  arsenal
and  capability,  I  think  we  will  lose  out.  People  will  accept  what  is
available in absence of something better.

So  I  think  we  have  a  challenge  to  get  out  there  and  preach,  if
you will, the benefits and the goodness of the process as well as the
documents.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  I  think  the  Chairman  is  going  to  tell  me  that  I
have  run  out  of  time,  and  I  have,  but  I  would  very  much  like  to
help you out in your enterprise. I would like to help you out as ef-
fectively as possible, and the challenge is to find a sufficiently large

carrot  or  a  smaller  carrot  backed  up  by  a  little  bit  of  a  stick.  So
if you all could help us think through what the appropriate carrots
and  sticks  would  be,  I  would  love  to  work  with  you  on  this.  It  is
a question of finding proper leverage.

Chairman  EHLERS.  The  gentleman’s  time  has  expired.  I  would
just  comment  that  carrots  have  never  done  it  for  me,  but  a  good
piece of pecan pie will always work.

But I would also observe, I have no expertise on the beta versus
VHS  issue,  but  you  are  clearly  right  on  the  MAC  versus  DOS  sys-
tem, and the public made the wrong choice there.

I am pleased, next to you, to recognize the gentlewoman from Il-

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for hold-

linois, Mrs. Biggert.

ing this hearing.

My first question is to Mr. Karmol. ANSI has been designated by
the  U.S.  Government  as  the  organization  that  represents  U.S.  in-
terests  in  international  standards  organizations,  such  as  the  ISO,
while  the  U.S.  Government  is  a  party  to  the  WTO  agreement  on
technical barriers to trade, which states that members shall ensure
that  standards  are  not  prepared,  adopted,  or  applied  with  a  view
to  or  with  the  effect  of  creating  unnecessary  obstacles  to  inter-
national  trade.  How  exactly  does  ANSI  ensure  that  it  has  accred-
ited  SDOs  and  the  standards  they  develop  comply  with  the  WTO
agreement?

Mr. KARMOL. Thank you, Ms. Biggert, for your question.
I guess the first point I want to make is that actually ANSI has
not actually been designated by the government as a representative
to  ISO  and  IEC.  We  are  the  representative—we  are  a  founding
member of both organizations. They are private sector, however, so
although  the  government  does  recognize  our  role  there  through
various means, we are really not officially designated.

With respect to your question about WTO principles, ANSI’s doc-
ument ‘‘The Essential Requirements’’ is the document that governs
the  development  of  American  national  standards,  and  that  docu-
ment requires openness, transparency, balance, and due process in
the  creation  of  American  national  standards.  And  we  think  that
properly  followed,  those  provisions  do  ensure  that  American  na-
tional  standards,  as  reviewed  by  ANSI,  will  not  be  barriers  to
trade.

Ms. BIGGERT. And Dr. Semerjian, how does the U.S. Government
ensure that ANSI-accredited SDOs and the standards that they de-
velop  comply  with  the  WTO  agreement,  in  your  opinion?  Would  it
be through monitoring or responding to complaints?

Dr.  SEMERJIAN.  Yeah,  I  guess  I  need  to  state  that  NIST  directly
is not involved in the implementation or—so those would fall in the
realm of the responsibility for USTR or perhaps ITA, but primarily
USTR.

But  these  certification,  accreditation  type  of  processes  are  done
through  internationally-recognized  organizations,  so  there  is  al-
ways  a  mutual  recognition  aspect  built  into  the  system.  So  what
ANSI  does  is  recognized  by  others,  their  counterpart  organizations
in other countries. And I don’t think that that is a real point of con-
tention, at least to my knowledge, but I am not very knowledgeable
in this area.

Ms. BIGGERT. I guess my problem seems to be that there is a dis-
connect  between  the  WTO  barriers  and  the  organizations,  such  as
ANSI and maybe with NIST.

Mr. Bhatia.
Mr. BHATIA. May I amplify?
I  would  like  to  suggest  that  all  signatories  to  WTO  member  na-
tions  have  an  obligation  to  adhere  to  those  principles.  ANSI,  as  a
representative of the United States to these organizations, is duty-
bound  to  comply  with  WTO  principles,  and  we  are  reflecting  that
in  all  of  the  documents  that  ANSI  uses  for  accreditation.  So  the
basic  criteria  of  openness,  of  balance,  of  consensus,  of  due  process
are  fundamental  principles  on  which  American  national  standard
designation  is  based.  You  can  not  become  an  American  national
standard  using  an  accredited  SDO  process  unless  you  comply  with
these criteria.

The further balance comes from checks and balances of public re-
view  comment  period,  an  obligation  to  respond  to  every  critique
that  is  presented  in  resolving  that.  And  we  have  an  additional
verification process to USTR and DOC in the form of industry tech-
nical  advisory  committees,  one  of  which  I  chair  along  with  mem-
bers  like  Bob  Noth  and  others.  And  these  individuals  make  sure
that  we  stay  on  the  track  and  we  report  back  to  USTR,  DOC,  and
Congress,  if  appropriate,  if  there  are  any  violations  that  are  noted
or recorded or complaints that are made.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Well,  in  2002,  the  ANSI  Chairman,  Oliver  Smoot,
said  that  the  ANSI  accreditation  process  applies  only  to  those
standards submitted to ANSI for adoption as an American national
standard, so there is——

Mr. BHATIA. That is correct.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  And  so  is  there  a  group  out  there  then  that  there
is no process to ensure that they are not complying if they haven’t
really——

Mr.  BHATIA.  You  are  absolutely  right.  There  is  a  large  body  of
SDOs who do not follow the accreditation process. I think they suf-
fer  in  the  marketplace  because  of  that.  They  lack,  perhaps,  some
of  the  credibility  and  some  of  the  prestige  that  goes  with  a  recog-
nized accredited process. And that affects the ability, if you will, in
their  marketplace  of  conducting  their  business.  For  some  industry
sectors, it works. For others, it is more important to have that cre-
dential,  especially  if  you  are  going  to  be  operating  internationally.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  Is  there  something  that  should  be  changed  then?
Mr. BHATIA. I think, as has been noted by other panel members,
the  system  we  have  is  very  market-responsive.  It  seems  to  work,
and  it  has  a  sectoral  approach  to  it,  which  seems  to  recognize  the
needs that are different for each industry sector.

Ms. BIGGERT. But there are no police, then, as far as the develop-

ment of standards or the standards being carried out?

Mr.  KARMOL.  If  I  may  respond  further,  Representative  Biggert,
ANSI actually does—in addition to the essential requirements that
our  accredited  standards  developers  are  required  to  use—we  audit
each of our accredited standards developers at least once every five
years to ensure that they are following The Essential Requirements.
We have actually suspended the accreditation of a number of orga-
nizations,  whose  names  I  am  sure  you  would  know,  if  I  mention

62

them, which I won’t. But we have a very strict audit procedure that
goes along with the accreditation process to make sure that our ac-
credited developers are using the process and following it precisely
as they have told us they will.

Ms. BIGGERT. Okay. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman EHLERS. The gentlewoman’s time has expired.
We will start a second round of questions.
Let  me—I  am  not  sure  I  can  ask  a  question  on  this,  but  let  me
just  share  some  of  my  unease  here.  The  world  has  dramatically
changed,  as  far  as  I  can  see,  in  the  area  of  standards.  Mr.  Noth,
you have been here a long time in this. Maybe you can verify that
or contradict it. But as a scientist, I remember being involved indi-
rectly  with  standards-setting,  and  there  was  always  a  good  spirit
about it, a good—saying, ‘‘This is good for all of us if we can agree
on  standards  and  let  us  all  work  together.’’  And  by  ‘‘all,’’  I  mean
different  countries.  What  seems  to  me  has  changed  is  that  not  all
countries are working out of a sense of integrity and good will any-
more.  And  perhaps  it  is  epitomized  by  what  a  friend  told  me  in
dealing  with  a  certain  country.  He  said,  ‘‘They  always  tell  the
truth,  except  when  it  is  not  convenient.’’  It  makes  it  very  hard  to
work together at that point. And several of you referred to the fact
that perhaps a trade representative’s office should be more heavily
involved in these issues. And I would certainly like to pursue that,
if you think that is something good. We do have a brand new trade
representative,  a  former  Member  of  Congress,  and  I  am  sure  he
will be very responsive to us.

You talked about the U.S. standard as having developed in a way
that  is  very  beneficial  for  our  country,  but  is  it  truly  beneficial  for
the rest of the world or is it even beneficial for us vis-a´-vis the rest
of the world? That is still not clear to me.

And a specific question, Mr. Karmol, you are working on the new

Standards Strategy. When do you expect that to be out?

And  then  I  will  ask—I  will  let  the  rest  of  you  respond  to  my

ramblings.

out?

When  do  you  expect  the  new  Standards  Strategy  to  be  coming

Mr. KARMOL. We have a draft at this point, Mr. Chairman, which
is  available  on  our  website,  and  it  is  referred  to  in  the  testimony.
We  do  have  some  thoughts—some  comments  that  came  in  during
the  comment  period,  which  ended  April  18,  which  we  are  review-
ing.  I  think  the  expectation  is  that  there  will  be  a  special  meeting
of our Board of Directors prior to our scheduled December meeting
to  approve  the  Strategy,  but  Mr.  Bhatia  may  be  the  better  person
to answer, since he is chairing the committee.

Would you like to——
Mr.  BHATIA.  All  I  can  do  is  give  you  our  best  estimate.  We  hope
to  have  this  accomplished  by  the  end  of  November.  If  the  dialogue
and review of the comments submitted and resolution of those com-
ments takes longer, I would propose to the ANSI Board and others
that we take our time and come up with a document that has more
meaning rather than one that is finished in a speedy fashion.

Chairman  EHLERS.  Thank  you  for  your  response  to  that  spe-
cific—now  would  any  of  you  like  to  comment  on  my  unease  or  set
me at ease or say, ‘‘You are right: we should all be uneasy.’’?

Mr. Noth.
Mr. NOTH. I think your unease is justified. There have been a lot
of  changes  in  the  standards  world.  Starting  with  the  European
Common Market’s activities in 1992 and their—what they call their
new approach as it evolved, that had the effect of taking what was
basically a technical process in the past, and your recollections, Mr.
Chairman,  as  a  scientist,  probably  remember  more  collegial  activi-
ties  between  technical  experts.  The  European  approach,  and  now
what  they  are  trying  to  export  and,  to  a  certain  extent,  the  ISO
and  IEC  approach,  puts  a  political  element  into  the  process.  So  it
is—now requires a two-level activity: one is an agreement between
experts,  when  you  can  get  the  experts  to  the  table;  and  two,  an
agreement  between  the  politicians  as  to  whether  or  not  the  agree-
ment of the technical experts makes sense to them in terms of their
developing world. And that creates some unease. It was challenging
enough when it was the United States and Europe that were basi-
cally  arguing  over  technical  specifications  and  political  issues.  The
size  and  the  forceful  entry  of  the—and  aggressive  entry,  not  force-
ful, but aggressive entry of the Chinese into the global markets has
also  shifted  the  balance  of  power,  and  they  are  not  the  only  ones:
the  South  Americans,  the  Indians,  the  former  Soviet  Union  coun-
tries,  the  CIS  countries  are  all  going  to  ultimately  want  to  claim
a share of this.

And  we  need  to  remember  that  standards  are  only  a  form  of
product  specification.  What  we  are  really  talking  about  here  is
trade issues on commerce and goods of services, because standards
are  simply  just  the  technical  underpinnings  of  many  of  those,  as
you said in your opening remarks.

So we need to make sure that ultimately we don’t lose that track.
One of the advantages of the U.S. system is that we are rapid. We
are—our system is much more responsive to innovation. We get our
technical specifications, when locally set, are often technically supe-
rior to what the rest of the world will adopt.

So  our  ability—our  efficiency  with  our  system  is  one  of  the  rea-
sons  why  our  economy  continues  to  be  the  economic  engine  of  the
world. And that is our advantage, Mr. Wu, is that we need to taut
that. And you are already starting to see some of that, because the
Europeans,  15  years  later,  now  are  shifting  their  activities  toward
what they call their Lisbon Agenda, trying to make their industries
more  competitive,  because  their  regulatory  agenda  that  they  have
pursued has moved them in the wrong direction.

So  you  are—ultimately,  market  forces  themselves  are  going  to
help  us  correct  and  let  other  countries  see  the  advantages  of  the
U.S. system.

Thank you, sir.
Chairman EHLERS. Do you ever expect we will ever have one vote

for the United States and one for the European Union?

Mr.  NOTH.  I  don’t  hold  my  breath  on  that  one,  Mr.  Chairman,
but I also know, from vast experience in this area, that it is a myth
to  believe  that  all  of  Europe  is  united  and  it  is  going  to  get  worse
before  it  gets  better  now  that  they  have  expanded  the  size.  So  the

fact that we are disadvantaged politically when ISO has more play-
ers  at  the  table  does  not  necessarily  mean  that  we  can  not  make
the  system  work  for  us,  because  we  can  work  behind  the  scenes,
based on the quality and effectiveness of our technical input.

Chairman  EHLERS.  And  of  course  we  could  always  say  we  have

our 50 different states and we need 50 votes.
A last quick one, Dr. Deutsch, and then——
Dr. DEUTSCH. I was going to vote for a vote for Alabama, myself.
Chairman EHLERS. I see.
Dr.  DEUTSCH.  I  would  like  to  follow  up  on  your  comment  that
things  have  changed.  And  one  aspect  of  the  change  from  the  per-
spective  of  the  IT  industry,  which  is—we  have  a  sector-based  ap-
proach in the United States, the IT industry has increasingly taken
our  standards  development  activities  outside  of  the  formal  process
where  we  have  the  ANSI-accredited  SDOs.  We  still  participate
there, and we still do work there, but a very, very substantial part
of  our  efforts  are  going  on  in  consortia  and  other  forums,  okay,
that—many  in  which  are  international  in  nature  from  the  begin-
ning, such as W3C. Okay. I can put on my Oracle hat and tell you
we  are  spending  more  money  today  in  fees,  in  engineers’  time,  in
travel  to  do  standards-related  activities  than  we  ever  have,  okay.
An increasing percentage of that money is being—and professional
time  is  being  spent  in  forums  other  than  ANSI-accredited  SDOs.
Okay.  And  that—the  effectiveness  of  what  we  are  doing  is  dem-
onstrated  whether  you  fire  up  your  MAC  or  fire  up  your  Microsoft
operating system and bring up your web browser and say, ‘‘Google,’’
and all of a sudden there is something there that you want to see.
There  is  a  layer  after  layer  after  layer  after  layer  of  standards,
which make that happen that we absolutely take for granted, okay,
and that is what you have gotten out of the standards system that
we have been using.

Chairman EHLERS. Okay. I guess—well, my time is running very
short,  but  I  just—thank  you.  I  am  just  troubled.  You  know.  Take
for  example  the  U.S.  cell  phone  standard  as  used  in  the  United
States.  The  European  standard  is  used  in  80  percent  of  the  world,
the non-U.S. portion. I—it is hard to say we have won on that one.

But Mr. Bhatia.
Mr.  BHATIA.  Yeah.  I  think  I  would  like  to  suggest  that  the
change  in  standardization  is  not  necessarily  bad.  I  think  it  is  the
natural  outcome  of  opening  up  of  the  markets.  If  you  talked  to
somebody 20 or 25 years ago, it was a given that you had to comply
with  Japanese  standards  and  Japanese  codes  if  you  wanted  to  sell
in Japan. You have to comply with the U.S. standards and the U.S.
codes if you had to sell here. With the exception of very few indus-
tries,  you  basically  had  to  work  with  standards  and  codes  of  that
nation  which  were  regulatory  or  marketplace  requirements.  But
the  opening  of  markets  with  the  trade  agreements  which  allowed
manufacturers  to  sell  and  seek  opportunities  in  multiple  markets,
the  standardization  process  needed  to  change.  There  was  more  of
a  need  to  participate  in  internationally-relevant  documents.  There
was  more  need  to  harmonize  standards.  There  was  more  need  to
be  aware  of  what  the  other  countries  were  doing,  so  you  could
avoid repetitive mistakes or repetitive efforts.

65

So  I  think  that  is  the  natural  outcome,  and  we  are  going  to  get
better  as  we  go  forward.  But  clearly,  make  no  mistake  about  it,
many  nations,  even  today,  use  standards  as  a  barrier  for  market
protection  for  supporting  their  inherent  industries  or  their  infra-
structures. And at some point, that will have to be taking a subser-
vient position, but for many countries, especially the new ones and
developing ones, criteria, which are unique in the name of national
security  or  national  interest,  are  in  the  transitional  period  do  pose
as barriers.

So  I  think  we  need  to  look  at  standards  that  need  to  be  more
harmonized, we need to be more participatory, and we need to open
up  our  system  to  allow  other  countries  to  participate  as  willingly.
Chairman EHLERS. Thank you all, and my time is more than ex-

pired.

I am pleased to call on Mr. Wu again.
Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I  want  to  make  one  comment  and  get  out  as  many  questions  as
I can. Some—I hardly recommend this institution as a model of ef-
ficiency,  however,  you  might  consider,  just  as  we  set  up  the  Con-
gress  with  two  Senators  for  every  state  and  then  population-
weighted  on  the  House  side,  that  you  might  have  each  country
have one representative in part of your standards-setting operation
and  then  have  a  GDP-weighted  chamber,  if  you  will,  for  the  other
part of it.

And  then  that  leads  me  to  my  first  question.  I  mean,  the  way
that  that  system  works,  as  it  works  here  in  Congress,  is  that  we
have  certain  efficiency  challenges.  The  speed  with  which  we  do
things  can  be  somewhat  challenging.  And  especially  for  you,  Dr.
Deutsch,  who—and  perhaps  others  would  want  to  comment,  it
seems  to  me  that  the  standards-setting  organizations  have  had
some difficulty in keeping up with technological change and that a
lot  of  private  sector  operations  have  gone  to  a  regime  where  folks
form consortia in the absence of a true standard of, you know, ‘‘We
need  something  quick,  and  we  need  it  now,  so  let  us  get  it  done
quickly.’’ Is there something that can be done to improve the speed
with which standards can be set?

Dr.  DEUTSCH.  Let  me  respond.  First  of  all,  in  the  interest  of  full
disclosure,  let  me  just  say  I  am  a  member  of  the  ANSI  Board.  I
also  serve  on  the  Board  of  an  ANSI-accredited  SDO,  the  INCITS,
which  is  an  ANSI-accredited  SDO  that  does  most  of  the  IT-related
standardization in the United States. And my observation, from my
personal  experience  over  even  more  years  than  Mr.  Noth  has  had
in  the  standards  business,  is  that  there  is  a  competitive  world  of
standards-setting  organizations  and  that  in  response  to  observa-
tions  such  as  yours,  which  I  think  was  absolutely  correct  10  years
ago,  okay,  the  standards-setting  organizations  have,  over  a  period
of  time,  recognized  the  threat  to  their  turf  and  have  responded.  I
can tell you this, if there is consensus, which is a big if, among all
of  the  stakeholders,  I  can  create  an  INCITS  ANSI-accredited  U.S.
standard in a very, very short period of time. If there is contention,
which there very well may be, my industry—I am sitting here rep-
resenting  both  Apple  and  Microsoft,  by  the  way,  Mr.  Chairman,
okay,  you  know,  there  is  frequently  disagreement  in  those  forums.

66

Then  it  takes  a  little  bit  longer.  The  time  is  to  resolve  the  dif-
ferences.

Mr.  WU.  Is  there  a  special  problem  in  the  medical  information
technology field? I mean, it seems to me that I hear repeatedly that
there  are  problems  with  inter-operability  of  platforms  in  medical
information systems.

Mr. NOTH. I can respond, wearing my ANSI International Policy
Committee  hat,  and  a  little  bit  of  knowledge  of  manufacturing.
Where  we  get  into  trouble,  and  if  you  look  back  at  the  history  of
standards or where there have been ‘‘standards wars,’’ usually you
have  problems  where  the  industries  have  innovated  and  brought
products  out  on  the  marketplace  and  had  them—and  had  an  in-
stalled base of investment for a long time before the standards ac-
tivity  started  to  actually  get  together  and  the  public  got  to—got
congealed in their opinion enough to start calling for standards and
inter-operability. And then you have people who play the game de-
fensively,  because  they  are  trying  to  protect  that  installed  invest-
ment  and  not  have  to—and  ultimately  you  end  up—that  is  where
the  beta  versus  VHS  kind  of  a  scenario  tends  to  play  itself  out  in
the  marketplace.  And  in  the  medical  device  community,  and  many
of those areas, it is exactly that way.

What  many  of  us  are  trying  to  do  in  the  new  technology  is  we
all have to recognize that it is slower in—where we have got an in-
stalled base. But in the new technologies, we are trying to be much
more  proactive  and  work  in  the  standards  world  ahead  of  the
game, so that you don’t get those innovations and that installed in-
vestment in the marketplace earlier, and that is the big challenge,
because it takes a significant commitment of resources and dollars,
you know, human resources in terms of subject matter experts and
dollars  to  get  out  there  ahead  of  the  products.  And  then  you  have
the  concerns  about  sharing  intellectual  property  or  destroying  a
competitive advantage in that activity.

So  it  is  the  challenge—everybody  is  working  on  it,  but  it  is  not

a simple problem to solve.

Mr.  WU.  Well,  we  will  take  this  conversation  off-line,  because  I

want to ask one quick question before the light goes red.

But  I  am  very,  very  surprised  that  there  would  be  this  large  in-
stalled based problem in the medical IS field, given the many com-
plaints  I  have  heard  about  lack  of  medical  IS.  So  it  seems  to  me
that,  you  know,  this  is  a  wide—it  should  be  a  wide-open  field  in-
stead of one strewn with installed-base problems.

But  Mr.  Noth,  I  am  very  sympathetic  to  your—to  the  challenge
you  raised  about  conformity  and  the  costs.  And  I  believe,  Dr.
Deutsch,  you  referred  to  that,  also.  And  maybe—that  is  part  of
Oracle’s  challenge,  also.  What  can  we  do?  What  can  we  do  to  de-
velop  better  reciprocity  between  different  national  or  continental
testing  organizations  so  that  we  can  decrease  the  costs  of  con-
formity testing and conformity standards?

Mr.  NOTH.  One  of  the  areas  we  have  worked  on  collectively  is
trying  to  ultimately  get  mutual  recognition  agreements  in  the—so
that  we  can  test  it  once  and  have  that  test  accepted  everywhere.

Mr. WU. What has held that up?
Mr. NOTH. Again, special interests. Ultimately, on a global basis,
you  are  talking  about  jobs  in  other  markets,  and  because  much  of

the  innovation  and  the  products  are  coming  from  the  developed
world,  whether  they  be  U.S.  or  Europe,  the  developing  world  is
much  more  interested,  as  I  tried  to  indicate  in  my  testimony,  not
only  in  making  sure  that  their  consumers  are  protected,  because
they are not sure they trust us, but also because they want to ulti-
mately  learn  from  the  technology  we  are  delivering  and  then  ad-
vance  their  own  industries  and  their  own  abilities.  Our  industry,
we  are  the  largest  manufacturer  of  farm  equipment,  agricultural
equipment in the world, full line farm equipment in the world. But
in  every  local  market,  we  face  local  competition,  who  makes  the
same products, and they are all very interested in knowing exactly
how  we  are  doing  it.  And  so  there  is  always  a  concern,  whether  it
be China or other markets, that are—that much of the testing that
is  being  done  is  really  a  reverse  engineering  activity,  and  very
often,  they  want  to  come  to  our  facilities  to  do  the  testing  rather
than have us ship the product to them to test so that they can not
only test the—see the product but also see how we produce it.

Mr.  WU.  Thank  you  very  much.  As  always,  the  answers  raise

even more questions.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Wu.
Ms. Biggert.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr.  Semerjian  and  probably  Mr.  Karmol  again,  when  we—what
recourse do U.S. companies have if there is—they think that there
is an SDO who is not adhering to the ANSI-accredited process and
they  have  no  intention  of—and  we  just  talked  a  little  bit—this  is
kind of the beta versus VHS, that they have no intention of submit-
ting it as a national—American national standard but really going
right to the international standard and bypassing the U.S. Is there
any  appeal  process?  What  happens  if  companies—and  that  would
be,  you  know,  to  be  out  in  front,  but  then  they  go  to  the  inter-
national and not to the American?

Mr.  KARMOL.  I  am  not  exactly  sure  I  understand  your  question.
Are  you  suggesting  that  a  company  has  an  issue  with  a  standard
that was developed by an accredited standards developer or——

Ms. BIGGERT. Yes.
Mr. KARMOL.—not?
Ms. BIGGERT. Yes.
Mr.  KARMOL.  If  the  standard  was  developed  by  an  accredited
standards  developer  and  submitted  as  an  American  national
standard——

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, no, I am saying that they bypass that process

and go and submit it as an international standard.

Mr.  KARMOL.  Well,  in  order  to  submit  it  as  an  international
standard, they would have to, essentially, go through ANSI, which
holds the seat in ISO.

Ms. BIGGERT. Yes.
Mr. KARMOL. So——
Ms.  BIGGERT.  But  they  don’t  have  to  submit  it  as  an  American

standard, do they?

Mr. KARMOL. Not necessarily, no.
Ms.  BIGGERT.  So  they  go  directly  to  an  international  standard,

what—and the U.S. company objects——

68

Mr. KARMOL. Well, the process——
Ms. BIGGERT.—what recourse would they have?
Mr.  KARMOL.  The  process  for  submitting  at  the  international
level, the technical advisory group, has the same requirements as—
operates  under  the  same  essential  requirements  as  we  require  of
our  accredited  standards  developers.  So  you  have  the  same  due
process  requirements  imposed  on  that  technical  advisory  group  as
you do on all of the accredited groups.

Ms. BIGGERT. Maybe Mr. Noth. You seem to——
Mr. NOTH. Maybe I should comment, Ms. Biggert.
The—that is exactly what our industry is doing, as I tried to put
into  my  testimony.  We  are  working  with—we  are  taking  our  pro-
posals  as  well  as  reacting  to  proposals  from  other  sources  and
working  our  whole  standards  issues  at  the  ISO  level,  because  that
seems to make the most sense for our industry. And all of our play-
ers anymore are more and more global in their scope.

There is—most of the standards in the U.S. at this point in time
are voluntary, so if an American company suggests that they don’t
like to use an ISO standard or follow all of its tenets exactly, they
have complete freedom to do that, as long as they meet the require-
ments  of  product  liability  or  market  acceptance  or  what  have  you,
and  they  can—if  they  want  to  petition  SAE  or  ASAE  or  any  other
SDO  to  put  up  a  competing  standard,  they  certainly  can  do  that,
and  that  occasionally  happens.  But  for  the  most  part,  because  ev-
erybody is interested in being able to produce at the lowest possible
cost  and  distribute  their  goods  on  the  broadest  possible  market,
working  with  an  international  standard  and  reducing  the  cost  and
the  number  of  venues  you  have  to  send  subject  matter  experts  to
makes  a  lot  of  sense.  So  really,  it  is—that  is  the  way  that  many
industry  sectors,  like  the  off-highway  industry,  is  pursuing  the—
pursuing global standards.

Ms. BIGGERT. Would a company have any recourse? Is there any

appeal process?

Mr.  NOTH.  Yes.  Yeah.  There  is  an  ANSI  appeals  process.  Any-

body who wanted to complain, would file——

Ms. BIGGERT. What about international?
Mr.  NOTH.  Well,  and  there  is  a  process  in  the  national  environ-

ment, but——

Ms. BIGGERT. International.
Mr.  NOTH.  In  the  international  environment,  but  there  is  also

an—there is an appeals process there as well.

Ms. BIGGERT. Do you think that this would at all undermine the
voluntary  consensus  standards?  I  mean,  it  is  voluntary.  You  don’t
see any problem with going directly and not having the——

Mr.  NOTH.  If  the  voluntary  process  worked  worldwide,  we
wouldn’t  really  have  a  big  problem,  because  it  would  be  fine  and
the  processes  are  great.  Where  we  are  getting  into  problems,  and
what  we  have  tried  to  put  into  our  testimony,  is  that  many  of  the
developing world and other countries around the world are blurring
the  line  between  what  is  voluntary  and  what  is  regulatory  by  cre-
ating mandatory requirements to comply with voluntary standards
before  you  can  sell  in  their  markets,  and  as  a  result  of  that,  the
process gains more political importance than it did maybe a decade
ago or longer.

Ms. BIGGERT. Dr. Semerjian, do you have any—at NIST, are you
concerned  about  how  ANSI  is  being  used,  then,  for  going  directly
to the international? I guess not.

Dr.  SEMERJIAN.  No,  I  think  they  have  represented  us  well.  We
are not a regulatory agency. This is—as was said again and again,
we  do  have  a  voluntary  system.  Companies  are  not  required  to
adopt  any  given  standard.  They  can—just  like  other  countries  are
doing,  they  can  adopt  their  own  standards.  They  can  adopt  some
other  country’s  standard.  The  question  is,  which  standards  serve
their purposes best? But we provide—we certainly contribute to the
robustness and the technical strength of the standards that are de-
veloped  by  ANSI-member  SDOs,  because  many  of  our—we  have
some—more than 400 NIST staff who serve as technical experts on
many, many committees.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  Would  there  be  any  reason  to  want  to  have  the
SDOs certified that they are in compliance with the WTO technical
barriers?

Dr.  SEMERJIAN.  I  think  the  system  that  Mr.  Karmol  articulated,
you  know,  is  very  well  defined,  and  they  have  very  specific  meas-
ures.  If  those  requirements  aren’t  met,  I  see  no  reason  why  there
would be an issue.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman EHLERS. The gentlewoman’s time has expired.
It  is  about  time  to  wrap  up,  but  I  have  a  few  quick  ones,  first.
First of all, this is—this may sound tongue in cheek, and it prob-
ably is, but it is not offered in jest. Do you think that any country
that has refused to adopt the metric standard has any right to ex-
pect  the  respect  of  other  countries  when  they  come  to  them  to
make suggestions about standards?

Mr. Noth.
Mr.  NOTH.  The  metric  issue  has  been—is  a  challenging  one,  and
of  course,  it  has  been  politicized  again.  But  you—it  is—most  com-
panies, at least, that are doing—dealing internationally are already
adopted  metric,  where  metric  is  available  in  the  marketplace.  The
automotive  industry,  certainly  in  your  state,  is  clearly  a  metric  in-
dustry. The—our industry is metric where we can be metric, metric
where the tools go on the nuts and the bolts and the washers. But
you still can not buy metric pipe, for example. You can’t buy metric
steel—or metric barstock around the world because that is the way
it  has  been—the  supplier  industry  has  developed,  and  so  even
metrics  don’t  apply  everywhere.  But  where  we  can  be  metric,  we
are.

The only industry that I know that is clearly is the aerospace in-
dustry, which has—which grew up in the United States, was based
on  U.S.  metrics  and  therefore  has  been  accepted  for  most  of  the
metric  legislation  and  that,  because  they  have—as  everyone  else
has said, we are totally satisfied in the redevelopment of all of that
technology is—would be a waste of time and resources.

Mr. WU. If the gentleman would yield for just one moment.
Chairman EHLERS. Yes, I would be happy to yield.
Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, I am just shocked and appalled that you
would attack the roots of American culture this way. The day when

a  football  field  is  no  longer  100  yards  long,  the  White  Cliffs  of
Dover are going to fall into the ocean.

I yield back.
Chairman EHLERS. Thank you for yielding back.
Now  I  think  it  is  a  major  problem.  I  remember  the  argument
when  Thomas  Jefferson  tried  to  institute  the  metric  system,  and
the  argument  was  that  it  would  cost  far  too  much.  It  would  be  $7
million  to  convert.  And  today,  of  course,  it  is  upwards  of  $170  bil-
lion or something like that.

More serious questions.
One  of  you  mentioned  that  perhaps  we  need  a  ‘‘standards  czar,’’
and  I  don’t  recall  who  mentioned  that,  but  is  that  a  general  feel-
ing?  We  should  have  a  ‘‘standards  czar’’  who  sort  of  ties  all  of  this
together?  Maybe  you  feel  we  have  one  already,  but  we  have  the
trade  issue,  which  somehow  seems  to  be  separate,  even  from  the
Department of Commerce, and we have the standards-setting proc-
ess, which is different from most of the rest of the world. What do
you think?

Mr.  NOTH.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  was  the  one  who  mentioned  it,  so  I

will respond and let the others add, as they see fit.

But  we  think  alignment  between  government  agencies  and  with
the  private  sector,  the  various  sectors,  is  critical  to  our  long-term
competitiveness.  And  so  we  think  we  need  some  accountability  to
get  the  alignment.  The  efforts  that  have—that  are  going  on,  the
Interagency  Council,  what  have  you,  are  a  bottoms-up  kind  of  ef-
fort.  We  need  a  little  bit  of  top-down  leadership  in  this  area  to
make sure that some of that alignment happens and it gets the ap-
propriate priority.

We  think  the  Department  of  Commerce  probably  is  a  good  place
for  that  ‘‘standards  czar.’’  We  probably  think  it  ought  to  be  a  gov-
ernment individual who is charged with oversight and has some ac-
countability in the area so that the alignment processes take place
with  a  little  bit  more  priority  and  urgency  than  we  have  seen  in
the  past.  And  that  is  why  we  propose  it.  We  think  it  ought  to  be
a  government,  because  the  sectors  are  so  diverse  and  what  have
you  they  are  going  to  put  their  people  forward.  What  you  need  is
someone  in  the  government  who  is  going  to  understand  what  we
are talking about in terms of standards and make sure that we are
all  basically  on  the  same  page  when  it  comes  to  how  we  deal  with
standards on the international arena.

Mr. BHATIA. I think——
Chairman EHLERS. Mr. Bhatia.
Mr.  BHATIA.  I  think  what  is  needed  is  empowerment  of  the  peo-
ple  at  policy  level  to  interface  effectively  with  the  private  sector
and advance our agenda on the international stage. If we have fed-
eral agencies, which are dedicated to their own particular mission,
their own empowered area of activity, if we have that coordination
at  the  policy  level,  we  will  not  be  successful.  It  could  be  a  ‘‘czar.’’
It  could  be  a  coordination  at  the  standards  executive  level  from
each  of  the  federal  agencies  that  works  effectively  to  resolve  the
horizontal  issues  but  leaves  individual  sectoral  issues  to  that  par-
ticular agency.

There  are  many  ways  to  skin  the  cat.  The  reality  is  we  do  need
more  attention,  more  recognition  of  the  impact  that  the  standards

have  and  the  standards  issues  have  on  the  economic  well  being  of
many,  many  industry  sectors.  That  is  lacking.  We  do  have  one
standards executive, Heidi Hejukata from ITA. We have executives
who  are  top-level  policy  people  in  various  federal  agencies  who
need to work together. There is an interagency standards policy co-
ordinating committee. I don’t know what the name is, but I believe
you  chair  that.  We  need  more  coordination  of  that.  We  need  more
linkages of these organizations with the private sector. And I think
we  need  to  have  them  more  focused  on  international  issues  and
problems.

Chairman EHLERS. Any other comments, Mr. Karmol?
Mr. KARMOL. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
I  certainly—I  don’t  want  to  be  at  odds  with  any  of  my  member
organizations here, but I think I would want to recognize that a lot
of  good  work  is  being  done  by  NIST  with  the  SIT  programs,  ITA.
There  is  now  great  coordination  within  the  Department  of  Com-
merce, headed by Heidi Hejukata. But we could use more coordina-
tion  among  the  agencies,  and  that  is  the  place  where,  you  know,
USTR  and  Commerce  and  the  Department  of  State,  if  there  could
be  some  coordination.  And  I  think  that  is  where  the  Congress  can
step  in.  And  I  think  if  Congress  would  raise  the  profile  of  this
whole  standards  community  and  the  importance  of  standards,  at
some point, by appropriate recognition of the U.S. Standards Strat-
egy  and  other  ways,  I  think  that  is  what  really  is  needed  to  bring
better coordination with the private sector and the government sec-
tor.

Chairman EHLERS. Thank you for your comments.
Did you have anything further that you wish to ask, Mr. Wu?
Mr. WU. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
There  are  a  host  of  questions  that  I  think  I  would  like  to  ask  in

writing, but just to—one final question.

The  overall  theme  that  I  have  heard  is  further  support  for  vol-
untary  private  sector  standards-setting  organizations  and  perhaps
further  advocacy  and—well,  the  question  is  this,  that  given  that
there  are  so  many  different  standards-setting  organizations,  do  we
talk about the system in general? Do we get behind particular ones
and  not  others?  In  essence,  how  do  we  set  the  standard  for  this
standard advocacy?

Dr.  DEUTSCH.  I  don’t  see  how  you  could  select  from  among  the
many.  And  I  think  one  thing  about  our  standards-setting  mecha-
nisms  in  the  United  States  is  that  it  is  constantly  evolving,  so  it
would be, I think, inappropriate to get behind a particular SDO or
a particular consortia. But—so therefore, I think the answer has to
be A, your first option, and that is that we really want to recognize
the benefits of the system in general and become a strong advocate
for that.

Mr.  BHATIA.  I  would  like  to  suggest,  once  again,  that  we  recog-
nize  that  we  have  a  sectoral  approach  to  the  standardization  proc-
ess. Different sectors would have different needs. Some would work
within the consortia type framework and would bypass the accred-
ited  process  or  the  very  long  and  prolonged  consensus-developing
process and it would work fine for them. I think there will be other
sectors,  which  are  more  heavily  dependent  on  health  and  safety
and environmental issues, which are much more heavily regulated,

72

and  government  agencies  and  others  have  to  participate  and  play
a  role.  I  think  there  we  have  to  have  a  different  approach.  There
are  other  opportunities  to  look  at  and  enhance  the  overall  quality
of the SDO activity.

One fundamental suggestion that I can make is we encourage all
of  the  players  to  adhere  to  nationally-recognized,  internationally-
honored  WTO  principles  of  standards  development  and  stick  with
that,  whether  it  is  a  credited  process  or  not.  If  we  do  the  right
things, if we bring the right people to the table, if we have an open
and  balanced  process,  if  we  give  an  opportunity  for  people  to  com-
ment and react honestly to those comments and those suggestions,
I think we will have a very robust and well-connected process.

Mr. WU. I want to thank all of the witnesses.
Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  and  all  of  the  Committee  staff  for  a

very, very interesting hearing.

Chairman EHLERS. I would certainly echo that. We couldn’t have
had a better Committee—or I am sorry, a better panel of witnesses.
And we really appreciate your contributions.

Yes, I see two—Dr. Semerjian, you——
Dr. SEMERJIAN. If I may, Mr. Chairman.
I would certainly like to finish this with some positive comments.
Things—there  are  some  things  that  are  working  well.  Mr.  Wu
asked  earlier,  you  know,  how  can  we  accomplish  mutual  recogni-
tion of conformance testing, et cetera. There is room, obviously, for
improvement  there,  but  one  area  where  we  have  made  significant
progress over the last 6 years, I guess, is we have signed—some 60-
some-odd  countries  have  signed  an  International  Bureau  of
Weights  and  Measures  mutual  recognition  arrangement  where  we
recognize  each  other’s  measurement  standards,  which  are,  obvi-
ously,  the  foundation  of  the  conformance  testing  and  the  other
standards activities.

So  at  least  in  those—in  that  area,  we  have  come  full  circle,  and
it  is  a  very  open  and  transparent  process  where  we  compare  our
capabilities with each other, and the results of these are shown on
the—you  know,  included  on  the  websites  of  all  of  the  laboratories,
so  you  can  basically  go  in  and  see  the  capabilities  vis-a´-vis  each
other  of  the  laboratory—National  Laboratories,  such  as  PTB  in
Germany  versus  NIST  or  versus  Japan  or  in  China.  So  this  is  one
area  where  mutual  recognition  of  measurement  standards  have
been accomplished in a very quantitative way.

And I think that is a significant step forward in this general area

of measurements and normality of standards.

Thank you.
Chairman EHLERS. Thank you.
Mr. Noth, did you want the last word?
Mr.  NOTH.  I  don’t  know  if  I  want  the  last  word.  I  just  wanted
to—and  I  don’t  know  that  I  could  speak  for  the  whole  panel,  but
I, for one, certainly would be willing to entertain any written ques-
tions or anything else that Mr. Wu or any of the other panel mem-
bers  would  like  to  submit  before  the  process  is  over.  I  think  this
is an excellent hearing, and I would—and we—I think I can speak
for the panel when we say we all appreciate the fact that you called
it  and  we  had  the  opportunity  to  highlight  these  issues.  And  any-

thing  further  we  can  do  to  help  you  understand  and  focus  on  this
activity, I think we are willing to participate.

Chairman  EHLERS.  I  appreciate  that,  and  without  objection,  the
record  will  remain  open  for  members’  statements  and  members’
written questions and your written responses. So without objection,
so ordered.

I  want  to  express,  again,  my  appreciation.  We  wandered  a  bit
away from what we were really after and that is the use of stand-
ards as trade barriers, but that is our overwhelming interest here,
and  we  will  certainly  continue  to  pursue  that  on  the  Committee.
And  the  advice  and  information  you  have  given  us  today  is  ex-
tremely valuable.

I will continue to argue for the metric system, even though I am
outnumbered,  I  think,  433  to  two,  but  I  would  also  comment  that
if  football  fields  were  100  meters  long,  probably  football  could  be-
come an Olympic sport, and maybe that would be enough of an in-
ducement.

I——
Mr. WU. Mr. Chairman, we have a term for 100-meter long foot-

ball field, and that is ‘‘Canadian football.’’

Chairman EHLERS. Thank you.
But the other fact that I have mentioned, the aerospace industry,
I  am  not  so  sure  it  operated  that  well.  We  have  lost  $150  million
satellite  because  they  used  the—didn’t  use  the  metric  system.  So
I  will  continue  my  battle  on  that,  but—without  conceding  defeat
but without anticipating a quick victory.

Thank you, again, very much for your expertise and the help you

have given us. It has been wonderful. We appreciate it.

And with that, the hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:05 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Hratch  G.  Semerjian,  Acting  Director,  National  Institute  of  Standards

and Technology

Questions submitted by the House Science Committee Majority
Q1. Are foreign governments using standards in a way that is inhibiting innovation,
competition,  respect  for  intellectual  property,  and  free  trade  in  products  where
the U.S. is competitive, and if so, how?

A1. The globalization of commercial activity is increasing the potential scope of the
effects  of  the  manner  in  which  governments  utilize  standards  in  technical  regula-
tions  to  regulate  products  for  their  safety,  health  and  environmental  effects,  and
also  the  effects  of  divergent  standards  systems.  The  U.S.  rule-making  process  is
characterized by transparency in the making of technical assessments, factual find-
ings, and normative policy choices, and transparent and open opportunities for pub-
lic  participation  to  ensure  effective  monitoring,  critiquing  and  reviewing  of  rule-
making.  Competition  and  respect  for  intellectual  property  are  inherent  in  both  the
U.S. regulatory and commercial arenas.

This  is  not  always  the  case  in  other  countries,  where  government  structures  and
economies  are  more  centralized  and  the  scope  of  government  authority  is  much
broader  than  in  the  United  States.  In  countries  where  the  government  retains  re-
sponsibility for directing the standards development process, participation in stand-
ards  development  activities  may  be  restricted  to  domestic  interests.  Laws  on  com-
petition and protection of intellectual property, if enacted, may not be enforced effec-
tively.
Q2. Are foreign governments using standards policy as a mechanism to protect their
domestic industries at the expense of external competition, including competition
from U.S. companies?

A2. As  noted  above,  some  foreign  governments  restrict  participation  in  standards
development activities to domestic interests. And in some cases, government, rather
than industry and market needs, drives the standards development process. The re-
sult  may  be  at  the  expense  of  external  competition.  The  WTO  Agreement  on  Tech-
nical Barriers to Trade was created to discipline the development and use of stand-
ards,  technical  regulations  and  associated  conformity  assessment  procedures  so  as
to prevent their use as trade protectionist tools. Among other things, the Agreement
requires  such  documents  to  be  developed  through  transparent  procedures  and  pro-
hibits the creation of unnecessary obstacles to trade.
Q3. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, what, if anything, should the U.S.

Government be doing to respond?

A3. The U.S. Government should continue to place a high priority on ensuring that
our trading partners live up to their WTO commitments, including those under the
Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  Agreement.  The  U.S.  Government  is  actively  pursuing
specific  trade  complaints  through  bilateral  representations  and,  as  appropriate,
seeking  third  country  support  by  raising  at  meetings  of  the  WTO  TBT  Committee.
We are also working in partnership with U.S. industry and the U.S. standards com-
munity  to  promote  the  advantages  of  market-driven,  globally  relevant  standards,
and the merits of openness and transparency in standards development.

Likewise, strong intellectual property laws and effective enforcement of those laws
is integral to stimulate and protect the creativity and innovation that is the founda-
tion  of  many  U.S.,  as  well  as  foreign,  industries.  The  USG  will  continue  to  work
with our foreign trading partners to ensure they implement and enforce their intel-
lectual  property  laws  and  will  oppose  the  development  of  any  standard  that  under-
mines the intellectual property rights of U.S. innovators.

Questions submitted by the House Science Committee Minority
Q1. The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  lays  out  a  series  of  ambitious  recommendations.
Aside from Congress endorsing the Strategy, will there be a follow-up document
laying  out  how  these  recommendations  should  be  implemented?  What  resources
will  be  required  to  implement  the  Strategy  and  what  does  the  Federal  Govern-
ment need to do?

A1. Once  the  Strategy  is  finalized,  later  this  year,  all  interested  parties—govern-
ment  agencies,  industry,  standards  developers  and  others—will  be  requested  to
identify appropriate implementation actions that will address the tactical initiatives

in  the  Strategy.  ANSI,  who  facilitated  the  development  of  the  draft,  will  serve  as
the  mechanism  to  coordinate,  integrate  and  report  progress  on  the  Strategy  at  reg-
ular intervals. The Interagency Committee on Standards Policy, composed of federal
agency  Standards  Executives  and  chaired  by  NIST,  has  received  periodic  briefings
on the status of the Strategy and will consider action on the Strategy document once
it  is  approved,  as  will  the  Trade  Policy  Staff  Committee  (Subcommittee  on  Stand-
ards and Technical Barriers to Trade), chaired by USTR.

Implementation  of  the  Strategy  should  help  the  U.S.  Government  to  address
many of its high-priority concerns by working in concert with the private sector. The
Strategy calls on government agencies to seek early collaboration with industry and
standards developers to identify standards needed to meet emerging national needs,
to  increase  participation  in  the  development  of  voluntary  consensus  standards,  to
continue to foster and support the unique character and strengths of the public-pri-
vate  partnership  in  standards  development  as  it  pursues  its  international  agenda,
and  to  work  with  counterparts  in  other  countries  to  encourage  the  consideration  of
all relevant standards in support of regulations.

Implementation of most elements of the Strategy will not necessarily require addi-
tional resources from federal agencies, but may require thoughtful alignment of ex-
isting programs with both the strategic goals and tactical objectives outlined in the
Strategy.  There  may  be  resource  implications  for  federal  agencies  associated  with
increasing participation in the development of voluntary consensus standards, how-
ever. Federal agencies have noted that maintaining their current levels of participa-
tion  in  standards  development  activities  is  becoming  increasingly  difficult  because
of competing agency priorities.
Q2. What do you think are the three most important things the Federal Government
needs  to  do  in  the  standards  and  trade  arena?  What  role  do  you  think  NIST
should play within the Federal Government and should NIST be doing anything
differently?

A2. The Federal Government needs to continue to place a high priority on ensuring
that  our  trading  partners  live  up  to  their  WTO  commitments  under  the  Technical
Barriers  to  Trade  Agreement.  Where  relevant,  education  of  foreign  governments  on
these  commitments  and  how  to  carry  them  out  effectively  should  be  a  component
of  this  effort.  The  government  also  needs  to  continue  to  engage  U.S.  industry  and
the  U.S.  standards  community  in  a  partnership  to  promote  the  advantages  of  mar-
ket-driven, globally relevant standards.

NIST  is  tasked  by  Congress  with  promoting  the  efficiency  of  the  U.S.  standards
system,  by  coordinating  federal  agency  use  of  non-government  standards  and  par-
ticipation  in  the  development  of  relevant  standards,  and  through  promoting  coordi-
nation between the public and private sectors in both the standards and conformity
assessment  arenas.  Under  the  Trade  Agreements  Act,  NIST  is  designated  as  the
U.S.  Inquiry  Point  for  the  WTO  Agreement  on  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade,  and  as
such  is  responsible  both  for  notifying  proposed  U.S.  technical  regulations  that  may
have  an  impact  on  trade  and  for  disseminating  notifications  to  U.S.  Government
agencies  and  the  private  sector  of  proposed  foreign  technical  regulations  and  con-
formity  assessment  requirements.  It  is  also  responsible  for  responding  to  requests
for information on U.S. standards and technical regulations.

NIST  technical  programs  support  global  awareness  of  U.S.  standards.  NIST  re-
searchers participate in standards development activities of 90 standards developing
organizations;  activities  that  help  ensure  the  transfer  of  NIST  measurements,
standards  and  technology  in  areas  ranging  from  information  technology  to  tele-
communications  to  health  care,  and  so  on.  NIST  programs  take  advantage  of
synergies  with  related  Department  of  Commerce  trade-related  programs  and  with
the private sector, and are critical to U.S. manufacturers’ access to export markets.
These  programs  include  our  Standards  in  Trade  Workshop  program,  maintaining
good working relationships with foreign standards officials, leadership in key stand-
ards  development  activities  that  impact  trade,  and  notifying  U.S.  exporters  of  pro-
posed technical regulations and standards in foreign markets.

NIST should expand its outreach to standards developers and industry to enhance
our  ability  to  define  high  priority  technology  issues  where  NIST-sponsored  work-
shops,  participation  in  developing  documentary  standards,  and  development  of
measurement technologies can facilitate the development and deployment of innova-
tive technology. In this context, NIST should develop specific metrics to measure the
impact  of  NIST  programs  in  these  areas.  In  the  area  of  knowledge  dissemination,
NIST  should  expand  web-based  access  to  standards  information,  both  for  federal
agency  use  and  to  support  U.S.  exporters.  NIST  should  also  expand  its  outreach  to
promote  awareness  of  U.S.  stakeholders’  opportunities  pursuant  to  the  TBT  Agree-
ment to influence the development of other countries’ standards and regulations.

Q2a. We  are  facing  an  increasingly  global  marketplace,  how  do  you  see  U.S.-based

standards organizations evolving over the next five to ten years?

A2a. U.S.-based standards organizations take a variety of different forms—trade as-
sociations, professional societies, consortia, and so on. Some serve very small market
niches,  while  others  serve  large  economic  sectors  or  reach  across  sectors  in  their
technical  work.  Many  of  the  standards  produced  by  U.S.-based  organizations  are
used  globally.  These  organizations  are  likely  to  evolve  toward  increasingly  global
membership,  allocating  a  larger  percentage  of  funds  to  translating  their  documents
into  other  languages,  and  working  in  partnership  where  feasible  with  national
standards  bodies  in  other  countries,  as  well  as  with  associations  of  national  bodies
such  as  ISO  and  IEC.  This  may  take  the  form  of  partnership  arrangements,  joint
adoption of standards, and/or sharing of workloads.
Q3. Clearly,  the  commitment  to  technical  assistance  by  the  EU  is  unmatched  by  the
U.S. in its coordination and magnitude. Is it fair to say that the EU and Euro-
pean  industries  believe  that  they  can  create  a  competitive  advantage  in  world
markets by strongly influencing the content of international standards? Will the
mass  marketing  by  the  EU  of  selected  standards  create  a  preference  for  Euro-
pean  products  rather  than  U.S.  products?  If  so,  what  should  the  U.S.  be  doing
and why have we waited so long to take any action?

A3. European  Commission  policy  gives  preference  to  international  standards,  spe-
cifically  ISO  and  IEC  standards,  and  regional  European  standards,  in  fulfilling  re-
gional regulatory requirements. Some European Union (EU) regional standards are
developed  specifically  to  meet  European  regulatory  requirements.  It  is  these  stand-
ards,  and  accompanying  European  regulations,  that  are  not  only  used  in  the  grow-
ing  EU  market,  but  are  also  being  promoted  for  use  in  emerging  economies,  which
comprise  some  of  the  major  U.S.  (and  EU)  export  markets.  In  addition,  a  number
of  countries  are  adopting  EU  standards  and  regulations  in  anticipation  of  joining
the  EU  and/or  to  ensure  their  domestic  exporting  companies  comply  with  the  EU
requirements.

The  U.S.  Government,  working  with  our  private  sector,  should  continue  to  pro-
mote  U.S.  interests  in  our  most  important  markets.  Our  message  needs  to  empha-
size the U.S. principles of effective standardization, which underpin the U.S. system
and  which  lead  to  standards  development  driven  by  the  marketplace,  with  sound
technical content, allowing for multiple technologies. The fact that U.S. Government
agencies  rely  to  a  great  extent  on  private  sector  standards  in  their  own  regulatory
and procurement activities, and the transparency and safeguards against trade pro-
tectionism  or  other  bureaucratic  abuse,  should  be  a  part  of  our  message  to  foreign
governments  as  well.  The  importance  of  delivering  a  positive  and  persuasive  mes-
sage  is  especially  critical  in  key  emerging  markets  where  infrastructure  is  lacking.
The Commerce Department launched its Standards Initiative in 2003 to facilitate
more effective Federal Government work to effectively promote U.S. standards inter-
ests  and  to  eliminate  standards-related  market  barriers  that  undermine  U.S.  ex-
ports  and  threaten  the  international  competitiveness  of  U.S.  industry.  A  Depart-
mental  report—‘‘Standards  &  Competitiveness:  Coordinating  for  Results,’’  May
2004—presents  a  broad  set  of  recommendations,  some  of  which  address  outreach
and  promotion.  Priority  action  has  been  taken  to  date  on  more  than  two-thirds  of
the report’s recommendations.

We  are  working  now  with  our  partner  agencies  on  the  Trade  Promotion  Coordi-
nating  Committee  to  build  on  these  recommendations  and  craft  a  trade  promotion
strategy  for  the  coming  year  recognizing  the  importance  of  standards  to  the  export
competitiveness of American companies. Our strategy endeavors to develop an ambi-
tious  partnership  with  U.S.  manufacturers  and  service  providers,  and  the  U.S.
standards community, to better promote U.S. standards interests in our most impor-
tant markets. This includes not only emerging, fast-growing markets such as China,
but also the EU itself. The USG is working with the EU through a variety of cooper-
ative  mechanisms  intended  to  promote  better  quality  regulation,  minimize  regu-
latory divergences and facilitate transatlantic trade.
Q4. Do  China’s  laws  and  regulations  concerning  the  recognition  and  use  of  ‘‘inter-
national  standards’’  comply  with  their  commitments  under  the  WTO?  If  not,  is
this  discrepancy  a  problem  for  U.S.  industry  and  has  the  U.S.  Government
taken any action to respond to industry concerns?

A4. China, as a Member of the WTO, has passed legislation to implement its WTO
commitments,  including  those  of  the  WTO  Agreement  on  Technical  Barriers  to

ards.  The  Department  of  Commerce’s  International  Trade  Administration  operates
a  monitoring  and  agreement  compliance  program,  which  actively  responds  to  the
concerns of U.S. industry and helps ensure that U.S. exporters receive the full bene-
fits of U.S. trade agreements.
Q5. The National Technology Transfer Act promotes the use of private standards by
U.S. Government agencies. How successfully has this Act been implemented and
what improvement could be made to the Act?

A5. NIST believes that implementation of the Act has very successful. The data re-
ported  by  federal  agencies  from  FY  1997  through  FY  2004  indicate  that  federal
agencies  continue  to  increase  their  use  of  private  sector  standards.  A  key  measure
of agency behavior in this area is the number of government-unique standards used
in  lieu  of  available  private  sector  standards.  This  figure  is  quite  small  compared  to
the  high  frequency  with  which  agencies  use  available  private  sector  standards;  in
FY 2004 the number of government-unique standards reported in this category was
about one-half-of-one-percent of the total private sector standards used.

For many federal agencies, the NTTAA serves to reinforce practices for using pri-
vate  sector  standards,  managing  and  reporting  standards  activities  as  called  for  by
pre-existing  legislation  and/or  policy  directives.  The  Departments  of  Defense  and
Energy,  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  Consumer  Product  Safety  Commission,
Food and Drug Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
are examples of agencies that have effectively developed such policies. However, for
a  number  of  agencies  implementation  of  their  NTTAA  responsibilities  has  been  dif-
ficult and slow, due to competing budget priorities.

The Interagency Committee on Standards Policy, chaired by NIST, has become an
effective  vehicle  for  exchange  of  important  information  affecting  standards  use  by
federal  agencies.  The  committee  also  serves  as  a  primary  point  of  contact  for  ad-
dressing  private  sector  concerns  about  use  of  government-unique  standards.  NIST
has  enhanced  its  role  as  coordinator  of  standards  use  within  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  in  other  ways  as  well.  In  2005,  NIST  launched  Standards.gov,  which  offers
background  materials,  useful  links,  and  search  tools  for  locating  information  about
government  use  of  standards  for  regulatory  and  procurement  purposes.  A  key  com-
ponent on the Standards.gov site is a searchable database of standards currently in-
corporated by reference into federal regulations.

Agency  opinions  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  the  Act,  and  therefore  the  need  to
make changes to it, are varied. Some government officials have found the Act to be
a  strong  motivator  for  encouraging  greater  use  of  private  sector  standards  and  in-
creased  participation  in  standards  development  activities.  On  the  other  hand,  some
agencies  have  questioned  whether  the  problems  that  made  passage  of  the  NTTAA
necessary  back  in  1995  still  exist  today.  The  bottom  line  is  that  since  the  passage
of  the  NTTAA,  federal  use  of  government-unique  standards  has  dropped,  while  the
number  of  private  sector  standards  used  by  the  government  in  both  regulation  and
procurement  has  increased  by  more  than  2600.  These  data  reinforce  the  fact  that
non-government  standards,  both  U.S.-developed  and  international  standards,  meet
government needs in both regulation and procurement. Now more than ever, federal
agencies  look  to  private  sector  standards  before  initiating  in-house  standards,  and
they are working in concert with the private sector to develop standards appropriate
for government use.
Q6. Last  year,  the  Commerce  Secretary  created  a  Standards  Liaison  office  and
issued  a  comprehensive  report,  Standards  and  Competitiveness:  Coordinating
for  Results  that  includes  50  recommendations  for  federal  action.  How  much
funding has been allocated to the Standards Liaison Office and to implementing
the  recommendations  in  the  Secretary’s  report?  A  year  later,  how  many  and
which of the recommendations have been implemented?

A6. The  Standards  Initiative  launched  by  then-Secretary  Don  Evans  in  2003  cre-
ated a position of Standards Liaison within the International Trade Administration.
There is, however, no Standards Liaison Office and therefore, no specific allocation.
As  part  of  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  for  Manufacturing  and  Services,
there  are  now  three  FTEs  specifically  dedicated  to  addressing  standards  concerns
of  the  U.S.  private  sector,  and  numerous  other  staff  throughout  ITA  (e.g.,  industry
and  country-specific  specialists,  as  well  as  Commercial  Service  domestic  and  over-
seas staff) who focus in part on standards-related issues and activities.

Priority  action  has  been  taken  to  date  on  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  50  rec-
ommendations in the 2004 report. Progress continues to be made on all fronts iden-
tified in the report. Based on a comprehensive assessment of Department standards-
related  programs,  substantial  work  has  been  done  to  improve  coordination  within
the Department.

An  ITA  standards  liaison  with  industry  was  named  more  than  a  year  ago  to  en-
sure that industry’s priorities on standards are promoted through the Department’s
international  policies  and  programs.  Intensive  training  is  being  provided  for  Com-
mercial Service officers and other ITA staff on standards-related issues.

Department  training  and  outreach  programs,  both  those  of  NIST  and  ITA,  have
been  enhanced  where  feasible  and  are  targeted  at  key  markets,  such  as  China,
where  industry  has  identified  standards-related  issues.  NIST,  ITA  and  TA  are  col-
laborating  on  the  2005  U.S.–China  Standards  and  Conformity  Assessment  Work-
shop scheduled for August 10–11, which will allow U.S. industry with export poten-
tial  and  interest  in  China  to  get  to  know  the  Chinese  Standardization  System  and
learn more about the Chinese system requirements for their market sector. Further-
more, the following NIST workshops have been delivered or are scheduled for FY05:
(1)  Standards  in  Trade  (SIT)  workshop  for  Israel  on  Roadway  Infrastructure  and
Safety  (April  2005),  Enquiry  Point  Workshop  for  the  Caribbean  (June  2005),  SIT
Workshop  on  Standards  and  Conformity  Assessment  in  the  Oil  and  Gas  Sector  in
India (August 2005). In addition, on July 1st, NIST launched a new, improved elec-
tronic  notification  system  for  U.S.  exporters  on  proposed  foreign  regulations  and
standards.
Q7. What are the duties of a Commercial Officer in a Standards position? For exam-
ple, the Department recently announced posting a Commercial Officer to the new
standards position in our Embassy in Beijing. What are the duties of the Officer
and  what  does  the  Department  hope  that  he  will  achieve?  Also,  what  special
skills and background are required to fill this technically-oriented post?

A7. In  general,  Foreign  Commercial  Service  Officers  (FCSO)  assigned  to  Standards
positions—currently  three,  in  Sao  Paulo,  Mexico  City  and  Brussels—provide  tech-
nical  support  to  their  respective  regions  on  standards-related  issues  that  might  af-
fect U.S. Government agencies or U.S. companies. The three current Commercial Of-
ficers in Standards positions, and the officer to be posted to the American Embassy
in  Beijing  this  fall,  provide  assistance  on  standards-related  issues  to  host  govern-
ment and private sector bodies that establish and implement policies, technical reg-
ulations or voluntary standards and conformity assessment practices that might af-
fect  market  access  for  U.S.  exports.  These  officers  arrange  and  participate  in  tech-
nical  assistance  projects  and  workshops  targeted  at  participants  from  the  region  in
which they are stationed, either in-region or in the United States.

The  Commercial  Officer  to  be  posted  to  the  Standards  position  at  the  U.S.  Em-
bassy  in  Beijing  is  a  career  FCSO  and  was  selected  through  a  rigorous  recruiting
and  panel  process  by  the  Department’s  Commercial  Service.  The  Officer  meets  the
language and technical expertise requirements established by the Commercial Serv-
ice  for  this  position.  Prior  to  posting  in  Beijing,  the  Officer  will  undergo  intensive
training, both at NIST and through the Commercial Service. As the Ambassador to
China  and  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  have  both  recognized,  there  is  a  clear  need
for a dedicated STANDARDS position in China, to facilitate communication and reg-
ular interaction with Chinese officials on standards issues.
Q8. Recognizing  that  access  to  global  markets  increasingly  depends  on  standards
being  set  by  other  countries  and  international  organizations,  what  is  the  policy
of  the  U.S.  towards  implementation  and  enforcement  of  the  WTO’s  Technical
Barriers  to  Trade  agreement  as  it  relates  to  the  definition,  recognition  and  use
of ‘‘international standards’’?
• Is  the  U.S.  Government  aware  of  any  country  whose  laws  or  policies  fail  to
comply  with  the  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  agreement  obligations  to  recog-
nize  and  use  international  standards  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  agree-
ment? If yes, what action does the U.S. Government take to ensure compliance?
• China’s  policy  is  that  ‘‘International  Standards  are  the  standards  issued  by
the  International  Standards  Organization  (ISO),  the  International  Tele-
communications Union (ITY) and other international organizations recognized
and  publicized  by  the  ISO.’’  Is  this  regulation  compliant  with  the  technical
Barriers to Trade Agreement and if not what changes will China be obligated
to implement to achieve compliance?

A8. The  WTO  Agreement  on  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  recognizes  the  right  of
Members  to  establish  standards  and  technical  regulations  but  establishes  a  set  of
rules  and  procedures  aimed  at  preventing  the  development  and  application  of  such
documents  as  unnecessary  obstacles  to  trade.  Among  other  things,  the  Agreement
encourages  Members  to  base  their  standards,  technical  regulations,  and  conformity
assessment procedures on ‘‘international standards,’’ if relevant ones exist and they
would  be  effective  and  appropriate  for  the  particular  objective  at  hand.  The  Agree-

81

ment  itself  does  not  define  ‘‘international  standards’’  nor  does  it  specify  the  use  of
standards  from  any  specific  international  standards-developing  body.  However,  the
WTO  Committee  on  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  further  refined  the  concept  of
‘‘international  standards’’  in  a  Committee  decision  which  emphasizes  the  need  for
international standards to be developed with ‘‘open, impartial, and transparent pro-
cedures that afford an opportunity for consensus among all interested parties.’’ The
United States played an instrumental role in the development of, and fully supports,
the Committee’s Decision. The amplified criteria assist in evaluating whether a par-
ticular standard or technical regulation of a trading partner is an unnecessary bar-
rier to trade.

The  Department  of  Commerce  is  unaware  of  any  individual  Member’s  law  or  na-
tional  policy  limiting  the  recognition  and  use  of  international  standards.  Likewise,
the Department of Commerce is unaware of any national or comprehensive Chinese
law or regulation limiting its recognition and use of international standards.
Q9. Has the Administration endorsed the U.S. Standards Strategy? What level of re-
sources  and  actions  will  be  required  by  the  Federal  Government  to  implement
the U.S. Standards Strategy?

A9. The U.S. Standards Strategy is still under development. We expect that a final
document  will  be  approved  by  the  ANSI  Board  of  Directors  sometime  this  fall.  The
Strategy  contains  recommendations  for  action  by  government,  ANSI,  standards  de-
velopers  and  industry.  The  Commerce  Department  will  consider  the  Strategy’s  rec-
ommendations for action by government agencies, identify areas where Department
standards-related  objectives  can  be  aligned  with  those  of  the  U.S.  Standards  Strat-
egy and promote similar actions by other government agencies.

The  Interagency  Committee  on  Standards  Policy,  composed  of  federal  agency
Standards  Executives  and  chaired  by  NIST,  has  received  periodic  briefings  on  the
status  of  the  Strategy  and  will  consider  action  on  the  Strategy  document  once  it  is
approved.  We  anticipate  that  individual  agencies  will  endorse  or  otherwise  indicate
support  for  the  Strategy  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  It  is  unclear  at  this  point  what
level of resources and actions will be required by the Federal Government to imple-
ment  relevant  elements  of  the  Strategy.  Since  government  interests  are  well  rep-
resented on the U.S. Standards Strategy Committee, responsible for development of
the U.S. Standards Strategy, they were able to provide ideas for strategies that will
meet  USG  needs.  Consequently,  alignment  and  implementation  should  not  be  dif-
ficult.
Q10. You  stated  that  the  Department  will  work  to  implement  relevant  elements  of
the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy.  What  are  the  relevant  elements  of  the  Strategy
and  what  level  of  resources  will  be  required  to  implement  these  recommenda-
tions?

A10. The  Department  plans  to  leverage  its  relationships  with  other  government
agencies, with industry and standards developing organizations, and with academia,
to implement key elements of the U.S. Standards Strategy. These include as a first
principle  the  Strategy’s  promotion  of  broad  access  and  inclusivity  in  the  standards
development  process.  This  is  a  clear  evidence  of  the  strength  of  standardization  in
the United States. The strategy recognizes that many types of organizations develop
standards,  and  that  new  modes  of  operation  and  new  methodologies  have  changed
the  standards  landscape  in  recent  years.  A  dynamic  standards  infrastructure  is
needed  to  meet  future  demands—both  government  and  private  sector.  The  Depart-
ment supports this standards infrastructure both through Department staff partici-
pation  in  standards  activities  and  through  coordination  among  federal  agencies  in
the  use  of  non-government  standards  and  participation  in  standards  development.
Another key element of the strategy is the encouragement of government at all lev-
els  to  seek  early  collaboration  with  industry  and  standards  developers  to  identify
standards needed to meet emerging national priorities. We have had success already
with  this  proactive  approach  in  both  the  homeland  security  and  nanotechnology
standards  arenas  where  NIST  staff  co-chair  private  sector  standards  panels  under
the  sponsorship  of  the  American  National  Standards  Institute.  The  strategy  also
recognizes  the  clear  link  between  standards  and  government  trade  policy  and  the
need for both the government and private sector interests to give more attention to
the  impact  of  standards  on  market  access.  Department  technical  and  policy  pro-
grams  support  global  recognition  of  standards  that  are  fair  and  responsive  to  mar-
ket  and  technology  needs.  We  expect  to  be  able  to  implement  key  elements  of  the
Strategy through focused allocation of existing budget resources.

Q11. NIST  has  proposed  a  FY06  initiative  on  standards  in  support  of  global  trade
to  address  specific  needs  of  U.S.  business.  What  are  the  specific  needs  of  U.S.
business, and what activities will NIST undertake under this initiative?

A11. In an increasingly globalized economy, the capacity to compete successfully de-
pends  on  the  ability  of  individual  manufacturers  to  satisfy  global  as  well  as  U.S.
measurement and standards requirements. To respond to global challenges, a grow-
ing  number  of  companies,  both  large  and  small,  are  organizing  their  operations  on
a  multinational  basis.  This  has  led  to  reduced  attention  or  dependence  on  nation-
centric  measurement  and  standards  infrastructures,  and  increased  demand  for  a
viable  global  infrastructure.  NIST’s  role  as  the  primary  agency  responsible  for  the
health  of  the  Nation’s  measurement  system  and  its  mandate  to  ensure  that  appro-
priate non-government standards are available to meet the needs of federal agencies
and  to  coordinate  between  the  public  and  private  sectors,  places  the  Institute  in  a
unique  position  to  address  these  international  measurement  and  standards  chal-
lenges.

In  order  to  promote  international  trade,  at  every  step,  U.S.  manufacturers  need
to  tie  their  processes  and  products  to  international  standards  of  measurement  that
are  provided  by  NIST.  Standards  and  calibrations  must  be  aligned  with  inter-
national  standards  to  give  U.S.  manufacturers  seamless  access  to  foreign  markets,
developing foreign and international standards efforts must be monitored for poten-
tial  impact  on  U.S.  exports  and  the  resulting  information  made  easily  accessible  to
U.S. manufacturers.

NIST  proposes  a  program  for  FY06  to  coordinate  with  U.S.  industry  to  meet  its
needs for leading-edge measurement capabilities for key technologies, and to develop
new  and  more  efficient  ways  to  deliver  the  highly  accurate  measurements  needed
by  U.S.  industry.  NIST  will  provide  the  technical  leadership  and  coordination  for
key  trade-related  documentary  standards  activities  in  specific  technology  sectors
such  as  wireless  communications,  manufacturing  systems  inter-operability  and
nanomanufacturing to ease access to foreign markets, and to ensure that U.S. inter-
ests are fairly represented. NIST also will work to align U.S. measuring instrument
standards  with  international  standards,  to  provide  standards-related  information
and  analysis  to  U.S.  industry,  and  in-depth  training  on  standards  and  measure-
ments for regulatory officials in key foreign markets. These activities are key to ena-
bling  U.S.  industry  to  overcome  market  access  barriers  and  compete  effectively  in
global markets.
Q12. The  Department  is  developing  a  strategy  to  do  a  better  job  of  promoting  U.S.
standards interests in foreign countries and especially in China. When will this
strategy be completed and what are the components?

A12. In  May,  the  Trade  Promotion  Coordinating  Committee  launched  an  inter-
agency  standards-related  promotion  plan  as  part  of  its  National  Export  Strategy.
NIST and ITA are taking the lead in partnering with the private sector and in con-
sulting  with  other  U.S.  Government  agencies.  The  plan  grew  out  of  the  Depart-
ment’s focus on markets with the most commercial potential. Standards area major
market access issue in many of these markets.

Some  elements  of  the  plan  have  already  been  implemented,  (e.g.,  focusing  of
NIST’s assistance and foreign outreach on target countries). A long-term goal is out-
reach  to  markets  (a)  whose  standards  systems  are  still  in  flux  and  (b)  where  EU
marketing of selected standards may create a preference for European products. The
target  markets  include  Brazil,  China,  India,  South  Korea,  and  Russia.  We  want  to
engage these trading partners in a more positive working relationship and improve
their  understanding  of  the  advantages  of  market-driven,  globally  relevant  stand-
ards, which advances U.S. technology.

In China, we are pursuing a series of cooperative ventures with the Chinese Gov-
ernment  and  U.S.  industry.  Through  ITA’s  Market  Development  Cooperator  Pro-
gram, we have awarded partner-matched financial awards to support the establish-
ment of three U.S. private-sector offices in China to work with the Chinese Govern-
ment  and  industry.  The  Department  of  Commerce  will  hold  its  second  comprehen-
sive U.S.–China Standards and Conformity Assessment Workshop this summer with
relevant  Chinese  Government  partners.  We  are  working  with  other  agencies  and
U.S. industry to head off new Chinese mandatory standards that create unnecessary
barriers to trade.

In the other spotlight markets, we are at various stages of developing and imple-
menting  strategies  for  engagement.  In  India,  the  Commerce  Department  has  pro-
posed  standards  as  an  initial  subject  for  re-energizing  the  U.S.–India  Commercial
Dialogue. In Korea, Embassy Seoul has found productive ways to engage the Korean
Government, and ITA and NIST are exploring options for expanding public and pri-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00086 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

83

vate  dialogue.  In  Brazil,  we  are  exploring  the  possibility  of  activities  focused  on
emerging  technologies  and  sectors.  In  Russia,  we  are  reaching  out  to  U.S.  industry
in Russia to identify partners and target sectors of interest.
Q13. NIST  intends  to  partner  with  U.S.  industry  and  standards  developers  to  pro-
mote the U.S. approach to standards development. What will NIST do to meet
this goal and what are you going to do differently from past activities?

A13. NIST,  working  with  ITA  and  other  parts  of  the  Department,  and  other  agen-
cies, will actively engage U.S. industry and the U.S. standards community in a part-
nership  to  promote  the  advantages  of  market-driven,  globally  relevant  standards
that  advance  U.S.  technology.  At  the  heart  of  this  outreach  plan  is  the  realization
that the United States will not succeed in overcoming standards-related market bar-
riers  unless  it  does  a  better  job  than  the  competition  in  promoting  standards  that
are  fair  and  responsive  to  market  and  technology  needs.  The  importance  of  devel-
oping  and  delivering  a  positive  and  persuasive  message  is  especially  critical  in  key
emerging markets where standards regimes are still in the formative stage. It is im-
portant  for  our  trading  partners  around  the  world  to  hear  loud  and  clear  how  rec-
ognition of U.S. and other market-driven, globally relevant standards can help them
improve  their  economic  efficiency  and  competitiveness  while  promoting  a  higher
quality of life.

In collaboration with the American National Standards Institute, the Department
is  planning  a  high  level  summit  meeting  of  standards  developers,  corporate  rep-
resentatives  and  key  government  participants  in  standards  activities  to  develop  a
proactive plan of action, based on the principles of the U.S. Standards Strategy and
the  Department’s  Standards  Initiative  and  Standards  and  Competitiveness  Report.
The goal is to identify and consider the many activities being undertaken by various
government,  corporate  and  standards  groups,  and  develop  options  to  better  coordi-
nate and leverage these actions; while also considering new actions to provide more
and  better  partnering  in  this  area.  With  respect  to  NIST’s  own  outreach  and  edu-
cation  programs—our  Standards  in  Trade  Workshop  program,  dialogues  with  for-
eign  standards  officials  and  other  outreach—we  will  expand  our  partnership  with
private  sector  stakeholders  to  facilitate  greater  reach  and  investigate  other  means
of disseminating information on the U.S. approach to standards development. NIST
has also begun referencing the National Export Strategy in its Federal Register an-
nouncements calling for Workshop applications.
Q14. Today  you  announced  that  NIST  will  launch  a  comprehensive  effort  to  road-
map  American  industry’s  measurement  needs.  How  long  will  this  take  to  com-
plete,  and  does  NIST  currently  have  the  funding  to  undertake  this  ambitious
project? How much funding will be required?

A14. This  comprehensive  effort  will  ultimately  involve  all  customers  and  stake-
holders of the U.S. measurement system (USMS), which is the complex of all meth-
ods,  instruments,  entities,  institutions,  and  standards  involved  in  measurements  of
products  and  processes  of  significance  to  the  economy,  security,  and  quality  of  life
of  the  Nation.  In  particular,  the  USMS  is  an  essential  component  of  the  national
innovation  infrastructure,  and  a  critical  element  of  the  strategic  environment  in
which  we  all  operate.  NIST  has  established  an  aggressive  timetable  for  completion
of the first iteration of the measurement needs roadmap, which will comprise a com-
prehensive  assessment  of  the  most  important  current  and  future  measurement
needs of the U.S. economy; a plan delineating what USMS solution providers intend
to  do,  both  individually  and  working  together,  to  address  those  needs;  and  identi-
fication of the most important gaps remaining, and the consequences of not address-
ing those gaps. We expect to publish the first USMS roadmap in late 2006 or early
2007.  NIST  and  other  interested  parties  will  monitor  and  report  periodically  on
progress  in  implementing  the  resultant  plan;  update  the  roadmap  on  an  ongoing
basis;  and  repeat  the  entire  process  approximately  every  four  years.  Given  the
breadth  and  complexity  of  the  task  at  hand,  NIST  estimates  that  it  will  take  three
iterations—or  ten  years—to  create  a  robust  self-sustaining  process  that  covers  the
entire  economy,  including  both  the  private  and  public  sectors.  NIST  is  committing
the resources necessary to complete the first iteration and to demonstrate the value
of the overall roadmapping approach.
Q15. Under  OMB  Circular  A–119,  NIST  is  responsible  for  collecting  and  reporting
to Congress on the participation by federal agencies in Standards Development
Organizations (SDOs). As a part of this requirement, do agencies report on the
level  of  participation  by  their  employees  in  standards  development  activities?
What  has  been  the  trend  in  federal  employee  participation  in  SDO  activities
over the past five years?

A15. Yes, federal agencies do report on their employees’ participation in private sec-
tor  standards  development  activities.  Over  the  past  five  years,  participation  of  fed-
eral agency personnel in the activities of private sector standards developers (SDOs)
has  increased  (from  2001  through  2003)  and  then  declined  slightly.  Agencies  con-
tinue to face competing budget priorities as they try to maintain adequate levels of
participation  in  SDO  activities.  Private  sector  standards  developers  continue  to  re-
quest  greater  government  participation  in  a  variety  of  development  activities.  U.S.
Government participation is an excellent way of ensuring that federal needs are con-
sidered  during  the  development  of  a  standard  and  making  sure  that  the  resulting
standard can be used by the government.
Q16. The  U.S.  Government  is  a  party  to  the  WTO  Agreement  on  Technical  Barriers
to Trade, which states that Members ‘‘shall ensure that standards are not pre-
pared, adopted or applied with a view to, or with the effect of, creating un-nec-
essary  obstacles  to  international  trade.’’  As  a  part  of  NIST’s  responsibilities
under  Circular  A–119,  does  NIST  ask  federal  employees  that  participate  in
standards  development  activities  to  report  if  the  standards  produced  are  in
compliance  with  the  WTO  Agreement  on  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade?  If  not,
should NIST monitor these activities to ensure compliance?

A16. The OMB Circular contains no requirement for federal employees to report on
the compliance of developed standards with the WTO Agreement on Technical Bar-
riers  to  Trade  (TBT).  The  Uruguay  Round  Agreements  Act  (Public  Law  103–465)
provided the basis for implementing the WTO TBT obligations in the United States.
The  Office  of  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative  has  overall  responsibility  for  domestic
implementation and works in partnership with other agencies via the TPSC to mon-
itor  implementation  and  develop  appropriate  responses  to  issues  identified.  Indi-
vidual  agencies  regularly  consult  with  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative’s  office  and
other relevant agencies through the trade policy coordinating process when they un-
dertake regulatory actions that may have an impact on trade.

Responses by Robert W. Noth, Manager, Engineering Standards, Deere and Company

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Questions submitted by the House Science Committee Majority
Q1. Are foreign governments using standards in a way that is inhibiting innovation,
competition,  respect  for  intellectual  property,  and  free  trade  in  products  where
the U.S. is competitive, and if so, how?

A1. The  answer  is  yes.  Europe  has  a  penchant  for  design  prescriptive  standards
that tend to inhibit innovation and to the extent they are successful exporting their
standards it remains a concern as it affects competitiveness and free trade in other
markets. In regard to intellectual property, John Deere has had negative experience
with  trademark  infringement  emanating  from  several  countries  including  China.
Overall however, the off-highway equipment sector has not been impacted by stand-
ards  disrespecting  intellectual  property  ownership  as  other  sectors  like  ICT  but  it
is a real concern with potential future impacts.
Q2. Are foreign governments using standards policy as a mechanism to protect their
domestic industries at the expense of external competition, including competition
from U.S. companies?

A2. The answer is clearly yes. In our industry sector, we can observe it in countries
all over the world, including Europe, South America, the CIS countries, China, and
even  Mexico  and  Canada  on  occasion.  It  is  most  notable  through  selective  enforce-
ment,  by  which  U.S.  products  are  challenged  but  locally-produced  goods  are  not,
even when designs are identical.
Q3. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, what, if anything, should the U.S.

Government be doing to respond?

A3. The  U.S.  Government  must  be  more  aggressive  in  addressing  these  issues  on
behalf of U.S. manufacturers. The U.S. should insist that our trading partners who
are WTO members live up to their commitments to the WTO principles, but in doing
so  the  U.S.  must  also  be  prepared  to  demonstrate  more  visibly  its  commitment  to
them. This is why, in previous testimony, we commented on the need for better tar-
geting of USAID and Trade Development Agency funding and programs, so that the
U.S.  can  provide  more  effective  technical  support.  Beyond  that,  our  other  rec-
ommendations  include:  new  priority  and  visibility  to  the  challenges,  better  align-
ment  between  government  agencies  and  the  private  sector  to  ensure  our  inter-
national message is clear and unambiguous, continued and annually secure funding
for  the  ongoing  efforts  of  NIST,  the  new  standards  initiatives  in  the  U.S.  Depart-
ment  of  Commerce  and  the  endorsement  of  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  with  ulti-
mate  support,  including  funding  for  the  appropriate  government-related  initiatives
outlined there.

Questions submitted by Representative David Wu
Q1. The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  lays  out  a  series  of  ambitious  recommendations.
Aside from Congress endorsing the Strategy, will there be a follow-up document
laying  out  how  these  recommendations  should  be  implemented?  What  resources
will  be  required  to  implement  the  Strategy  and  what  does  the  Federal  Govern-
ment need to do?

A1. Actually,  the  proposed  Strategy  encourages  individual  sectors  to  develop  their
own follow up documents. The work recently completed by the Aerospace Sector out-
lining  their  strategy  provides  an  excellent  example.  John  Deere  is  involved  in  the
Off-Highway Sector’s efforts to utilize a similar approach and in appropriate forums;
we encourage other sectors to consider it as well. As was initiated with the current
version  of  the  strategy,  ANSI  will  keep  track  of  the  sector  specific  strategies  and
tactical  initiatives  as  they  are  reported  and  issue  an  annual  status  report.  Most,  if
not all of the recommendations presented and discussed in the hearing are included
in the proposed Strategy document. The effort required to implement will come pri-
marily from the private sector but there are some important public sector elements.
Some  of  the  recommended  initiatives  in  the  public  sector  are  new  but  most  are  ex-
tensions  and  expansions  of  efforts  already  underway  that  need  to  be  made  more
visible and adequately funded. The Federal Government needs to ensure those out-
comes.

Q2. What do you think are the three most important things the Federal Government
needs  to  do  in  the  standards  and  trade  arena?  What  role  do  you  think  NIST
should play within the Federal Government and should NIST be doing anything
differently?

A2. (1)  Improved  direct  support  for  and  increased  government  participation  in  the
U.S.  standards  system.  This  includes  restoring  support  for  ANSI,  as  our  National
Standards Body in international forums and include funding for emerging standards
initiatives  driven  by  global  public  interest  (such  as  Social  Responsibility)  that  at-
tract subsidized support internationally but without enough immediate impact to be
fully  supported  by  U.S.  private  sector  funding;  support  for  our  outreach  and  pro-
motion  of  the  U.S.  Standards  System  and  US  based  standards;  encouragement  for
more  government  personnel  to  participate  in  private  sector  standards  development
and support for education and training of foreign service/foreign commercial service
officers in standards and standards issues.

(2) Increased policy level coordination between U.S. Government departments and
agencies engaged in standards activities so as to better align with private sector ac-
tivities.  The  U.S.  can  maximize  its  power  and  influence  by  better  coordination  to
avoid sending conflicting messages or signaling conflicting priorities.

(3) Congressional endorsement of the U.S. Standards Strategy. The signal sent by
this  act  would  of  itself,  indicate  better  coordination  between  the  public  and  private
sector,  reinforce  the  U.S.  Standards  System  and  motivate  the  resources  required  to
effectively implement it.

Regarding  NIST,  we  believe  they  have  a  uniquely  important  place  in  the  U.S.
standards  system.  Dr.  Semerjian  itemized  some  of  the  agency’s  many  roles  in  his
written and oral testimony, from basic metrology as applied to the wide span of U.S.
commerce  and  ranging  to  advanced  Research  and  Development  in  important  or
emerging technologies like cryptography and nanotechnology. They are also the U.S.
WTO  inquiry  point  and  conduct  Standards  in  Trade  (SIT)  workshops.  Both  are  im-
portant  resources  to  our  trade  partners  and  U.S.  stakeholders.  These  important
services need to be maintained and allowed to grow to keep pace with demand.
Q3. We  are  facing  an  increasingly  global  marketplace,  how  do  you  see  U.S.-based

standards organizations evolving over the next five to ten years?

A3. Market forces relative to globalization will continue to impact different industry
sectors  in  different  ways  and  on  different  timelines  so  even  in  five  to  ten  years  the
impacts  on  U.S.-based  standards  organizations  will  be  mixed.  Most  U.S.-based
standards  organizations  evolved  in  support  of  a  specific  industry  or  technology  sec-
tor  and  enjoyed  a  captive  market  for  their  standards  as  long  as  the  products  made
to  their  standard  specifications  were  acceptable  in  the  markets  the  industry  chose
to  serve;  primarily  but  not  exclusively  U.S.  or  North  American.  As  the  companies
that  make  up  those  industries  seek  to  be  competitive  in  new  global  markets  and
are  faced  with  new  demands  from  both  customers  and  governments,  the  previously
symbiotic relationship becomes at risk. The future of those standards organizations
will  be  determined  primarily  by  the  decisions  made  by  the  constituent  companies
in  the  sector  and  in  part  by  how  the  standards  organizations  choose  to  respond  to
those  decisions.  In  some  sectors  the  market  for  U.S.  produced  standards  may  dry
up in favor of more internationally acceptable specifications established in other or-
ganizations as the company/industry seeks the best fit solution. Those organizations
thus  effected  will  be  forced  to  consider  a  revised  business  model.  Large  organiza-
tions  serving  many  sectors  may  have  to  support  multiple  processes  to  better  serve
their constituents; much like SAE has done to effectively serve the standards needs
of  their  Aerospace,  Automotive  and  Commercial  Vehicle  sectors.  (See  question  8
below). Smaller, more narrowly focused organizations may have to consider merger,
acquisition,  partnership  or  loss  of  the  standards  line  of  business.  To  a  large  degree
‘‘competing  standards’’  are  an  oxy-moron  and  over-capacity  relative  to  the  demands
of the market eventually results in consolidation of suppliers in some form.
Q4. Clearly,  the  commitment  to  technical  assistance  by  the  EU  is  unmatched  by  the
U.S. in its coordination and magnitude. Is it fair to say that the EU and Euro-
pean  industries  believe  that  they  can  create  a  competitive  advantage  in  world
markets by strongly influencing the content of international standards? Will the
mass  marketing  by  the  EU  of  selected  standards  create  a  preference  for  Euro-
pean  products  rather  than  U.S.  products?  If  so,  what  should  the  U.S.  be  doing
and why have we waited so long to take any action?

A4. Yes.  In  fact,  Europe  has  published  documents  indicating  their  commitment  to
that very strategy. Our company already has experience with sales contracts in sev-
eral countries where a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Europe and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

87

that country resulted in a preference for European manufactured products where it
did  not  exist  before.  We  recently  experienced  a  problem  of  this  nature  with  Turkey
for  example.  As  stated  in  previous  testimony,  effective  and  timely  response  is  de-
pendent  on  new  priority  and  visibility  being  given  to  the  U.S.  Government  depart-
ments  and  agencies  already  working  to  meet  the  challenge.  Better  alignment  be-
tween  them  and  the  private  sector  must  also  be  assured  so  our  international  mes-
sage  is  clear  and  unambiguous.  This  has  to  include  secure  funding  for  them  and  a
retargeting  of  the  funds  allocated  to  USAID  and  the  Trade  Development  Agency  to
better address these specific challenges.
Q5. Do  China’s  laws  and  regulations  concerning  the  recognition  and  use  of  ‘‘inter-
national  standards’’  comply  with  their  commitments  under  the  WTO?  If  not,  is
this  discrepancy  a  problem  for  U.S.  industry  and  has  the  U.S.  Government
taken any action to respond to industry concerns?

A5. China  has  made  it  clear  on  several  occasions  in  public  that  they  do  not  share
the U.S. interpretation of the WTO language defining ‘‘international standards,’’ and
have taken positions against products that incorporate U.S.-based standards in their
specifications  that,  under  the  U.S.  interpretation,  should  be  perfectly  acceptable.
This  makes  the  Chinese  position  a  problem  for  U.S.  industry  in  many  sectors.  The
U.S. Government has been quick to respond to these concerns and there are several
private  sector  initiatives  as  well.  While,  the  Chinese  attitude,  up  to  this  point,  re-
mains  unchanged,  we  need  to  continue  to  press  the  point  through  all  appropriate
channels of communication.
Q6. The National Technology Transfer Act promotes the use of private standards by
U.S. Government agencies. How successfully has this Act been implemented and
what improvement could be made to the Act?

A6. The  U.S.  Government  agencies  have  made  a  good  faith  effort  in  implementing
the  NTTAA,  with  a  positive  impact.  In  effect,  it  forges  a  partnership  between  the
public  and  the  private  sector  that  benefits  both  sectors.  We  believe  its  shortcoming
is  that  it  allows  exceptions  based  on  the  unilateral  judgment  of  the  agencies,  with-
out  recourse.  As  suggested  in  previous  testimony,  establishing  a  policy  level  over-
sight  committee  to  be  made  up  of  senior  agency  officers  might  provide  an  appro-
priate level of accountability and provide needed incentives for enhanced alignment
and cooperation. Another alternative might be to elevate interagency standards con-
cerns  enough  to  create  an  incentive  for  agency  executives  to  become  more  actively
engaged  with  the  existing  Interagency  Council  on  Standards.  The  objective  is  to
speak  more  clearly  and  unambiguously  and  therefore  more  effectively  in  inter-
national discussions on standards utilized in trade.
Q7. You  mention  that  many  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  countries  and  sig-
natories to the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement have not yet implemented
its  provisions.  Which  countries  are  the  worst  offenders  and  how  does  this  hurt
U.S.  companies?  How  responsive  has  the  U.S.  Government  been  in  addressing
this issue and how do you think governmental actions could be improved?

A7. The  worst  offenders  are  listed  annually  in  The  National  Trade  Estimate,  a  re-
port  to  Congress  from  the  office  of  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative.  It  lists  specific
trade  issues  and  problems  by  country  that  are  compiled  from  industry  input.  Im-
pacts  on  U.S.  companies  include  lost  sales  and  increased  costs  due  to  meeting  re-
quirements  not  imposed  upon  local  competitors.  The  numbers  vary  by  country  but
add  up  to  a  substantial  amount  of  lost  trade.  The  sensitivity  and  responsiveness  of
the  U.S.  Government  to  these  issues  has  been  good  and  continues  to  improve.  The
recommendations in my earlier testimony are aimed at making that responsiveness
even better.
Q8. As  your  industry  has  become  more  globally  focused,  you  depend  more  on  the
International  Standards  Organization  (ISO)  for  standards  development.  How
has  this  affected  how  your  industry  funds  and  interacts  with  traditional  U.S.-
based  standards  organizations  such  as  the  Society  of  Automotive  Engineers
(SAE) and the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE)? As industry
becomes  more  globally  focused,  how  do  you  think  U.S.-based  standards  organi-
zation  will  need  to  evolve?  What  should  the  Federal  Government  do  differently
in the face of these changes?

A8. In  the  past,  SAE  and  ASAE  have  relied  upon  a  combination  of  three  streams
of revenue to fund their activities related to standards development. They primarily
depend  upon  sales  revenue  from  the  documents  and  seek  voluntary  industry  con-
tributions  in  addition  to  cover  their  costs.  Membership  dues  subsidize  any  shortfall
from  the  other  two.  Their  industry  constituents  are  the  primary  source  of  all  three

88

streams. Over the last decade, as market forces have consolidated the Off Highway
Equipment  Industry  reducing  voluntary  contributions  and  increased  demand  for  a
more internationally acceptable standards portfolio has driven document sales reve-
nues  to  other  organizations,  these  revenue  streams  no  longer  consistently  cover
costs and have put pressure on dues to provide adequate funding. Concurrently the
surviving industry participants have realized that going forward we cannot continue
to  fund  redundant  committees  as  they  currently  exist;  often  at  the  industry,  na-
tional,  regional  and  international  levels,  with  the  potential  for  each  to  produce  its
own  unique,  proprietary  or  conflicting  standards.  (Reference  the  response  to  ques-
tion  3.)  However,  to  participate  effectively  in  ISO,  we  still  need  services  from  SAE
and  ASAE  in  the  form  of  US  Technical  Advisory  Group  (US  TAG)  administration,
plus meeting and secretariat services. Therefore we’ve been working with both soci-
eties  to  change  their  financial  model  in  relation  to  our  industry,  from  one  that  was
based on producing documents for sale to one of providing these services. Since the
service  expectations  are  easily  quantifiable  and  the  cost  is  predictable,  the  new
model  becomes  more  like  a  service  contract  where  the  participants  are  expected  to
pay  their  share  of  the  cost  to  maintain  the  service.  The  model  appeals  to  industry
participants  and  the  societies  in  that  it  simplifies  the  funding,  makes  it  more  pre-
dictable  and  manageable  as  an  ongoing  cost  of  doing  business.  The  model  is  not  a
new one as it has been utilized in other sectors successfully for some time; however
it does represent a change to our industry and for the societies involved.

A  point  worth  noting  is  that  SAE  also  supports  aerospace  and  automotive  indus-
try  sector  standardization  needs,  in  addition  to  Off  Highway  equipment.  Each  of
these  sectors  is  pursuing  an  international  standards  strategy  uniquely  tailored  to
its products and market situation. To respond effectively to multiple constituent re-
quirements,  SAE  reorganized  as  their  historical  approach  no  longer  suited  any  of
their  constituent  industries  well.  ASAE  is  in  a  similar  situation  but  with  some
smaller  industry  sectors  serving  a  business  markets.  This  speaks  to  the  broader
question on how U.S.-based standards organizations will need to evolve and my ear-
lier response to question 3.

The Federal Government’s best response to this is to focus on maintaining a level
playing  field  for  U.S.-based  products  and  services  in  the  international  trade  arena.
Specific actions to address this were included in my earlier testimony and reiterated
in response to question 4. Additional specificity is contained in the draft of the U.S.
Standards Strategy.
Q9. You believe there needs to be better communication between the government and
private  sector.  You  also  recommend  better  alignment  between  the  private  sector
and  federal  agencies.  Could  you  give  us  some  examples  what  needs  to  be  done?
A9. The  Department  of  Commerce  Standards  Initiative  started  under  Secretary
Evans,  the  more  recent  Manufacturing  initiative  as  well  as  the  ongoing  activities
within  NIST  and  the  ITA  are  excellent  examples  where  focused  dialogue  between
private  sector  stakeholders  and  government  in  specific  sector  oriented  workshops
has improved understanding and resulted in actionable agendas. We are pleased to
see that most of the recommendations have been endorsed and are moving forward.
These  efforts  deserve  continued  support  from  Congress  in  the  form  of  appropriate
recognition and continued funding. However, to ensure long-term success two things
need to happen:

1. Continued dialogue is necessary to ensure private/public sector alignment on
priorities  as  conditions  change  and  new  issues  emerge.  Such  programs  need
to seen as on-going processes, not a one time activities.

2. The  information  obtained  from  agency  interaction  with  the  private  sector
needs  to  be  shared  more  effectively  across  the  several  agencies  of  govern-
ment so a more common agenda can be pursued when government to govern-
ment discussions take place relating to international trade issues. The main
challenge seems to be that many agencies do not see such coordination activ-
ity as an element of their legal mandate. Congress needs to more clearly pro-
vide incentives for such communication and coordination.

This  is  the  rationale  for  why;  in  previous  testimony  we  expressed  a  desire  for
more  engagement  from  policy  level  executives  either  by  creating  a  new  policy  level
mechanism  or  by  creating  incentives  for  greater  executive  engagement  in  existing
mechanisms.
Q10. You hit on a key point of the U.S. Standards Strategy—implementation. Aside
from  Congress  endorsing  the  Strategy,  what  is  required  for  the  Strategy  to  be
undertaken and executed efficiently?

A10. The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  addresses  the  broadest  cross-section  of  the  U.S.
economy because every sector utilizes standards in one form or another and activity,
relative  to  standards  and  standardization,  is  going  on  every  day.  The  objective  of
the Strategy is to channel that activity more productively.

Due to the decentralized nature of the U.S. Standards System, implementation re-
sponsibility  remains  largely  within  the  private  sector.  If  the  strategic  initiatives
identified  are  judged  by  private  sector  elements  to  improve  competitiveness  by  ad-
dressing  identified  problems  they  will  likely  be  resourced  to  a  level  commensurate
with  the  perceived  benefit.  We  anticipate,  based  on  the  response  to  the  current
version of the U.S. Strategy, the updated version, based on more input from an even
larger  cross-section  of  the  U.S.  standards  community,  will  result  in  even  better  re-
sponse in pursuing implementation.

Government however, plays a unique and important role and what it does or does
not do to support and implement the elements of the strategy relevant to their role
in  the  system  will  have  significant  impact  on  the  private  sector.  For  example,  as
indicated in oral testimony, John Deere utilizes its resources to try to resolve prob-
lems experienced in commerce by direct interaction as a first step. We only attempt
to  enlist  government  support  when  our  efforts  prove  insufficient.  Some  of  the  prob-
lems we have related in hearing testimony have reached that point. Likewise, many
of the issues addressed in the strategy, especially related to international trade, are
not  things  the  private  sector  can  resolve  without  government  understanding  of  the
sector  specific  issues  and  direct  government  to  government  interaction  on  their  be-
half. The caveat is in understanding sector specifics because what may be a solution
in one sector may be problematic in another. If this is not well understood and that
understanding reflected in the government to government dialogue, the intervention
might solve the problem in one sector and wreak havoc in several others.

Whether  or  not  Congress  chooses  to  publicly  endorse  the  strategy,  if  the  specific
recommendations it contains, many of which were also proposed in testimony at the
hearing,  are  not  funded  and  implemented  there  will  be  negative  consequences  on
the  competitiveness  of  U.S.-based  industry  and  ultimately  on  the  whole  U.S.  econ-
omy.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Donald  R.  Deutsch,  Vice  President,  Standards  Strategy  and  Architec-

ture, Oracle Corporation

Questions submitted by the House Science Committee Majority
Q1. Are foreign governments using standards in a way that is inhibiting innovation,
competition,  respect  for  intellectual  property,  and  free  trade  in  products  where
the U.S. is competitive, and if so, how?

A1. Yes, industry recognizes from first hand experience that standards are not only
the  domain  of  the  technical  and  business  communities.  Policy-makers  in  the  U.S.
and abroad are increasingly interested in and actively influencing a range of stand-
ards  and  technical  regulatory  issues.  Governmental  interest  and  activity  plays  a
critical role in today’s global economy and influences the competitiveness of the ICT
industry,  including  innovation,  competition,  respect  for  intellectual  property,  and
market access.
Q2. Are foreign governments using standards policy as a mechanism to protect their
domestic industries at the expense of external competition, including competition
from U.S. companies?

A2. Yes,  it  is  our  experience  that  some  governments  do  use  and  promote  national
or  regional  standards  as  a  mechanism  to  achieve  their  industrial  policy  objectives.
Perhaps  one  of  the  best  illustrations  of  this  dynamic  is  the  recent  experience  that
our  industry  had  when  the  Chinese  Government  proposed  the  mandatory  adoption
of a Chinese-developed Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) standard, best known
by its acronym, ‘‘WAPI.’’ This example illustrates the concerns that many industrial
sectors,  particularly  the  U.S.  high  technology  sector,  are  currently  facing  in  China.
The  damaging  precedent  that  could  have  been  set  with  WAPI,  in  which  a  govern-
ment—a  signatory  to  the  WTO  agreement—mandates  a  technology  and  forces  do-
mestic  production  of  that  technology,  would  have  had  significant,  negative  implica-
tions for technological development and global economic growth. We believe this ex-
ample highlights many challenges the industry is facing, not only in China, but also
around the globe.
Q3. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, what, if anything, should the U.S.

Government be doing to respond?

A3. When asked what should be the role of the Federal Government in standardiza-
tion,  we  are  always  very  careful.  We  believe  there  is  indeed  a  role,  including  in  re-
sponse  to  the  actions  of  other  governments.  It  is  a  limited  and  clearly  defined  role
that  is  responsive  to  industry  needs  and  performed  in  partnership  with  industry.
It  is  an  increasingly  important  role.  Specifically,  we  look  to  the  U.S.  Government
to  perform  two  functions  related  to  standardization—to  promote  the  creation  and
use  of  voluntary,  market-driven  standards  and  to  stimulate  openness  in  trade  and
markets by helping to defend against the use of standards as barriers to innovation
and market access.

More  specifically,  we  can  point  to  three  specific  initiatives  that  can  help  the  U.S.
Government to play that role—two that exist to a degree and one that does not exist
as yet.

First,  in  2002,  ITI  recommended  that  the  Commerce  Department  create  a  high-
level  standards  and  technical  regulatory  policy  function  to  work  with  industry  to
identify  and  address  both  immediate  and  more  long-term  commercial  policy  issues
in  countries  and  regions  around  the  world.  The  Commerce  Department  has  taken
steps  to  implement  this  recommendation.  We  believe  that  it  can  take  additional
steps  to  strengthen  the  function,  including  with  additional  staff  and  resources,  in
order  to  ensure  the  most  effective  standards,  technical  regulatory,  and  market  ac-
cess activity across all its agencies.

Second, in 2002 ITI also recommended that the Commerce Department strengthen
the existing Standards Attache´ Program. In particular, we sought a program expan-
sion to include attache´s for China, the rest of Asia, and Geneva to supplement exist-
ing attache´s in Brussels (to deal with European standards issues) and in Brazil. Be-
cause  of  the  strategic  utility  of  this  program,  we  also  recommended  that  the  Com-
merce  Department  take  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  it  is  both  managed  and  lo-
cated within the Department to retain an exclusive focus on standards and technical
regulatory  issues  around  the  world.  Moving  forward,  we  would  like  to  position  the
program for ongoing effectiveness, and we recommend that the Department support
a formal assessment of the Attache´ Program’s results, its training program, location

within the department, and budgetary needs. ITI is committed to working with the
Commerce Department to continue making progress on these recommendations.

Finally,  we  believe  there  is  another  potential  activity  for  the  USG  and  the  Com-
merce  Department  that  we  believe  is  critically  important  moving  forward  and  one
that  should  be  given  serious  consideration.  We  think  that  the  Commerce  Depart-
ment  can  work  with  industry  to  continue  strengthening  and  examining  the  pilot
U.S.–EUICT Standards Dialogue. Additionally, we see today even more clearly than
in 2002 a critical opportunity to support industry’s standardization policy and mar-
ket access objectives around the world by working with industry to develop a stand-
ards and market access research and analysis program to better understand the key
issues  discussed  at  the  hearing.  There  would  be  a  real  policy  and  commercial  use
for some analysis of key policy issues (e.g., defining what is the global economic im-
pact  of  standards,  developing  a  comparison  of  government  support  and  promotion
of standards, forecasting global standards participation trends, etc.). The Commerce
Department has existing staff expertise that could be valuable in designing and im-
plementing this research and analysis program.

Questions submitted by Representative David Wu
Q1. The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  lays  out  a  series  of  ambitious  recommendations.
Aside from Congress endorsing the Strategy, will there be a follow-up document
laying  out  how  these  recommendations  should  be  implemented?  What  resources
will  be  required  to  implement  the  Strategy  and  what  does  the  Federal  Govern-
ment need to do?

A1. ITI is a member of ANSI as are several of its member companies. We have not
yet  had  an  opportunity  to  review,  discuss  and  conclude  on  a  position  regarding  the
current  public  draft  of  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy.  We  will  be  including  the  U.S.
Standards  Strategy  on  the  agenda  of  all  of  our  relevant  committees  in  the  near  fu-
ture  so  that  we  can  arrive  at  a  consensus  position  regarding  the  document  as  well
as on a possible congressional endorsement.
Q2. What do you think are the three most important things the Federal Government
needs  to  do  in  the  standards  and  trade  arena?  What  role  do  you  think  NIST
should play within the Federal Government and should NIST be doing anything
differently?

A2. When asked what should be the role of the Federal Government in standardiza-
tion,  we  are  always  very  careful.  We  believe  there  is  indeed  a  role.  It  is  a  limited
and clearly defined role that is responsive to industry needs and performed in part-
nership  with  industry.  It  is  an  increasingly  important  role.  Specifically,  we  look  to
the  U.S.  Government  to  perform  two  functions  related  to  standardization—to  pro-
mote  the  creation  and  use  of  voluntary,  market-driven  standards  and  to  stimulate
openness  in  trade  and  markets  by  helping  to  defend  against  the  use  of  standards
as barriers to innovation and market access.

A critically important way that the Federal Government can promote the creation
and  use  of  voluntary  standards  is  to  be  actively  and  appropriately  engaged  in  the
standards development process. The Federal Government should be engaged as both
a consumer of voluntary standards and as an important technical resource. This role
is  identified  in  the  National  Technology  Transfer  and  Advancement  Act  and  NIST
keeps track of how the Federal Government is participating in the voluntary stand-
ards process.

In  the  standards  and  trade  arena,  we  can  point  to  three  specific  initiatives  that
can  help  the  U.S.  Government  to  play  a  positive  role—two  that  exist  to  a  degree
and one that does not exist as yet.

First,  in  2002,  ITI  recommended  that  the  Commerce  Department  create  a  high-
level  standards  and  technical  regulatory  policy  function  to  work  with  industry  to
identify  and  address  both  immediate  and  more  long-term  commercial  policy  issues
in  countries  and  regions  around  the  world.  The  Commerce  Department  has  taken
steps  to  implement  this  recommendation.  We  believe  that  it  can  take  additional
steps  to  strengthen  the  function,  including  with  additional  staff  and  resources,  in
order  to  ensure  the  most  effective  standards,  technical  regulatory,  and  market  ac-
cess activity across all its agencies.

Second, in 2002 ITI also recommended that the Commerce Department strengthen
the existing Standards Attache´ Program. In particular, we sought a program expan-
sion to include attache´s for China, the rest of Asia, and Geneva to supplement exist-
ing attache´s in Brussels (to deal with European standards issues) and in Brazil. Be-

cated within the Department to retain an exclusive focus on standards and technical
regulatory  issues  around  the  world.  Moving  forward,  we  would  like  to  position  the
program for ongoing effectiveness, and we recommend that the Department support
a formal assessment of the Attache´ Program’s results, its training program, location
within the department, and budgetary needs. ITI is committed to working with the
Commerce Department to continue making progress on these recommendations.

Finally,  we  believe  there  is  another  potential  activity  for  the  USG  and  the  Com-
merce  Department  that  we  believe  is  critically  important  moving  forward  and  one
that  should  be  given  serious  consideration.  We  think  that  the  Commerce  Depart-
ment  can  work  with  industry  to  continue  strengthening  and  examining  the  pilot
U.S.–EUICT Standards Dialogue. Additionally, we see today even more clearly than
in 2002 a critical opportunity to support industry’s standardization policy and mar-
ket access objectives around the world by working with industry to develop a stand-
ards and market access research and analysis program to better understand the key
issues  discussed  at  the  hearing.  There  would  be  a  real  policy  and  commercial  use
for some analysis of key policy issues (e.g., defining what is the global economic im-
pact  of  standards,  developing  a  comparison  of  government  support  and  promotion
of standards, forecasting global standards participation trends, etc.). The Commerce
Department has existing staff expertise that could be valuable in designing and im-
plementing this research and analysis program.
Q3. We  are  facing  an  increasingly  global  marketplace,  how  do  you  see  U.S.-based

standards organizations evolving over the next five to ten years?

A3. Our  industry  is  a  truly  global  one.  For  our  industry,  the  focus  is  not  on  how
domestic  standards  are  developed  ‘‘in  the  U.S.;’’  but  rather  on  creating  global  tech-
nical standards that support the growth of the worldwide ICT market. Because our
industry designs and builds single products for a global market, we actually develop
international,  globally  relevant  standards  in  different  venues  and  organizations
around  the  world—not  simply  American  National  standards  in  a  U.S.  standardiza-
tion  infrastructure.  We  need  that  flexibility,  because  the  ICT  sector  depends  on
standards today more than ever. The rapid pace of change in our sector, with prod-
uct  cycles  measured  in  months,  not  years,  requires  companies  and  their  suppliers
constantly to modify, improve, and re-develop their technologies, products, and serv-
ices in order to satisfy worldwide consumer demands. Standards and their develop-
ment process must stay relevant and keep pace with this fast changing, global mar-
ketplace.  We  expect  this  global  focus  on  standards  development  to  remain  a  reality
for our sector into the future.
Q4. Clearly,  the  commitment  to  technical  assistance  by  the  EU  is  unmatched  by  the
U.S. in its coordination and magnitude. Is it fair to say that the EU and Euro-
pean  industries  believe  that  they  can  create  a  competitive  advantage  in  world
markets by strongly influencing the content of international standards? Will the
mass  marketing  by  the  EU  of  selected  standards  create  a  preference  for  Euro-
pean  products  rather  than  U.S.  products?  If  so,  what  should  the  U.S.  be  doing
and why have we waited so long to take any action?

A4. Regardless  of  the  strategies  and  industrial  policies  of  other  governments,  our
industry  strongly  believes  in  the  value  to  the  international  marketplace  of  global,
market-led,  voluntary  standards  that  support  innovation  and  inter-operability.  We
encourage  the  U.S.  to  redouble  advocacy  efforts  to  promote  this  approach  to  stand-
ardization.  The  U.S.  Government  should  directly  engage  with  other  governments
about  how  internationally  recognized,  market-led  technology  and  standards  can
grow economies and benefit all parties.

From our various experiences with standards policy issues in markets around the
world,  we  have  learned  that  our  industry  needs  to  engage  in  an  ongoing  basis  at
the  policy  level  directly  with  our  government  and  other  governments,  particularly
in  emerging  markets,  about  how  technology  and  standards  can  help  grow  their
economies  and  why  it  is  in  their  interest  to  adopt  and  deploy  internationally-recog-
nized, voluntary, market-driven standards. We need to redouble our already consid-
erable  efforts  promoting  processes  that  support  such  standards  since  they  address
user  needs  and  promote  innovation  and  inter-operability.  We  need  to  encourage
market  access  so  that  consumers,  industry,  and  economies  around  the  world  can
benefit from innovative technological advancements.
Q5. Do  China’s  laws  and  regulations  concerning  the  recognition  and  use  of  ‘‘inter-
national  standards’’  comply  with  their  commitments  under  the  WTO?  If  not,  is
this  discrepancy  a  problem  for  U.S.  industry  and  has  the  U.S.  Government
taken any action to respond to industry concerns?

A5. The  Chinese  and  U.S.  ICT  sectors  are  large,  important,  and  growing  parts  of
the  global  economy.  China’s  approach  to  and  use  of  standards  is  a  complex  set  of
issues.  Our  sector  has  worked  very  closely  with  the  U.S.  Government  on  a  range
of  China  standards  and  technical  regulatory  issues  that  can  be  integral  parts  of
broader industrial policies and directly impact trade flows and market access.

The  WAPI  example  discussed  at  length  at  the  hearing  illustrates  the  concerns
that  many  industrial  sectors,  particularly  the  U.S.  high-technology  sector,  are  cur-
rently  facing  in  China.  The  damaging  precedent  that  could  have  been  set  with
WAPI,  in  which  a  government—a  signatory  to  the  WTO  agreement—mandates  a
technology  and  forces  domestic  production  of  that  technology,  would  have  had  sig-
nificant,  negative  implications  for  technological  development  and  global  economic
growth.

With  this  example,  ITI  worked  closely  with  our  government  to  make  sure  this
issue was on the agenda of both the Administration and the Congress. After consid-
erable  dialogue  culminating  in  the  April  2004  meeting  of  the  Joint  Commission  on
Commerce  and  Trade,  the  Chinese  Government  agreed  to  indefinitely  suspend  im-
plementation  of  this  mandatory  standard,  revise  the  standard  based  on  comments
from  foreign  and  domestic  firms,  and  participate  in  international  standards  bodies.
Q6. The National Technology Transfer Act promotes the use of private standards by
U.S. Government agencies. How successfully has this Act been implemented and
what improvement could be made to the Act?

A6. We  support  the  promotion  and  use  of  voluntary,  market  driven  standards  by
the  U.S.  Government  as  described  in  the  NTTAA.  We  encourage  even  greater  par-
ticipation,  where  appropriate  and  as  a  standards  consumer  and  technical  resource,
in the standardization process by the U.S. Government.
Q7. Dr.  Deutsch,  when  the  Chinese  ‘‘WAPI’’  standard  first  became  an  issue  for  U.S.
industry, how prompt was the U.S. Government in responding to industry’s con-
cerns? What could the government have done better?

A7. ITI worked closely with several U.S. Government agencies on this issue—which
transpired relatively rapidly and which demanded significant private and public sec-
tor attention and action.

The  Chinese  Government  issued  the  compulsory  ‘‘WAPI’’  security  standards  ini-
tially  in  May  of  2003.  After  considerable  dialogue  over  the  course  of  not  even  one
full  year,  at  the  April  2004  meeting  of  the  Joint  Commission  on  Commerce  and
Trade,  the  Chinese  Government  agreed  to  indefinitely  suspend  implementation  of
this  mandatory  standard,  revise  the  standard  based  on  comments  from  foreign  and
domestic firms, and participate in international standards bodies.

We  believe  that  the  private  and  public  efforts  on  this  issue  were  both  appro-

priately collaborative and effective.
Q8. Dr.  Deutsch,  you  recommend  that  the  Commerce  Department’s  Standards
Attache´ program  needs  to  be  strengthened.  What  should  be  the  duties  of  a
Standards  Attache´ and  what  sort  of  skill  set  are  needed  by  the  Attache´s?  How
many of these Attache´s do we need and where should they be located?

A8. ITI  believes  that  the  USG  should  strengthen  the  current  Standards  Attache´
program  at  the  Department  of  Commerce  by  expanding  the  program  to  include
attache´s  for  China,  the  rest  of  Asia,  and  Geneva  to  supplement  existing  attache´s
in  Brussels  (to  deal  with  European  standards  issues)  and  in  Brazil.  Because  of  the
strategic  utility  of  this  program,  we  also  recommend  that  the  Commerce  Depart-
ment take necessary steps to ensure that it is both managed and located within the
Department  to  retain  an  exclusive  focus  on  standards  and  technical  regulatory
issues  around  the  world.  We  believe  that  the  Commerce  Department  should  take
necessary steps to make certain that the program’s personnel selection, performance
criteria, incentives, career path definition, and training all reinforce the goal of pro-
viding effective standards attache´s for industry. Finally, ITI would like the USG to
position this program for ongoing effectiveness, and so we also recommend that the
Department support a formal assessment of the Attache´ program’s results, its train-
ing program, location within the department, and budgetary needs.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Joe  S.  Bhatia,  Vice  President  and  Chief  Operating  Officer,  Under-

writers Laboratory

Questions submitted by the House Science Committee Majority
Q1. Are foreign governments using standards in a way that is inhibiting innovation,
competition,  respect  for  intellectual  property,  and  free  trade  in  products  where
the U.S. is competitive, and if so, how?

A1. Underwriters Laboratories Inc. is a standards development and product testing
and certification organization, and as such cannot speak to whether foreign govern-
ments’ standards inhibit innovation in products where the U.S. is competitive. This
information  perhaps  can  be  best  supplied  by  industry.  However,  there  are  cases  in
which  foreign  governments’  testing  requirements  duplicate  testing  already  con-
ducted  under  internationally  recognized  schemes.  Having  to  duplicate  the  tests  in-
creases  costs  for  manufacturers  and  thereby  affects  their  competitiveness.  China’s
in-country testing for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is one such example. (See
page 8 of written testimony for details.)
Q2. Are foreign governments using standards policy as a mechanism to protect their
domestic industries at the expense of external competition, including competition
from U.S. companies?

A2. Underwriters  Laboratories  Inc.,  due  to  the  nature  of  its  work,  cannot  corrobo-
rate  the  use  of  standards  policy  as  a  mechanism  to  protect  domestic  industries.
However, the often top-down approach to standards development in many countries
means  that  processes  are  sometimes  not  open  and  transparent,  and  not  all  inter-
ested  stakeholder  groups  can  participate.  Resulting  standards  can  thus  sometimes
have  unintended  or  unanticipated  consequences,  which  may  affect  the  competitive-
ness of U.S. products.
Q3. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, what, if anything, should the U.S.

Government be doing to respond?

A3. The U.S. Government should aggressively negotiate market access for U.S. test-
ing  and  certification  providers  in  all  free  trade  agreements  (FTAs)  and  future
rounds of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The ability to offer testing and cer-
tification  services  to  local  requirements  means  that  companies  like  Underwriters
Laboratories  Inc.  can  bundle  testing  for  customers  and  help  reduce  manufacturers’
global compliance costs.

The  U.S.  Government  should  better  fund  standards  and  certification  education
and  outreach.  For  instance,  all  current  and  future  U.S.-negotiated  FTAs  should  in-
corporate technical assistance (and corresponding funding) for standards and certifi-
cation.  The  National  Institute  of  Standards  &  Technology  (NIST)  Standards  in
Trade (SIT) workshops should be better funded to increase the number of workshops
held annually.

Consideration  should  be  given  to  funding  additional  standards  attache´ positions
within  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  (DOC)  in  select  countries  or  regions,  in-
cluding Saudi Arabia and Korea. The standards attache´s currently in place in Mex-
ico  and  Brussels  have  proven  pivotal  in  helping  to  identify  potentially  troublesome
trends and in helping U.S. companies work through related regulatory issues.

Questions submitted by Representative David Wu
Q1. The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  lays  out  a  series  of  ambitious  recommendations.
Aside from Congress endorsing the Strategy, will there be a follow-up document
laying  out  how  these  recommendations  should  be  implemented?  What  resources
will  be  required  to  implement  the  Strategy  and  what  does  the  Federal  Govern-
ment need to do?

A1. The  proposed  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  (USSS)  encourages  individual  sectors
and organizations to develop their own specific implementation plans and tactics as
well as their own strategic documents. This approach helps amplify and supplement
specific  elements  of  the  USSS  while  at  the  same  time  respecting  individual  organi-
zations’ own needs. The work recently completed by the Aerospace Sector, outlining
its strategy provides an excellent example. ANSI will help track the specific strate-
gies and tactical initiatives as they are reported and issue an annual status report.
Most, if not all of the recommendations presented and discussed in the hearing are
included in the proposed strategy document.

The resources required to implement the USSS must come from a combination of
private and public constituencies. Some of the recommended initiatives are new but
most  are  extensions  and  expansions  of  efforts  already  underway  that  need  to  be
more robust and better funded.

Consideration of a Congressional earmark of $2 million for ANSI implementation
efforts and international standards outreach would be appropriate. In 2001, a grant
of  $2  million  was  requested  through  NIST.  The  result  was  a  $500,000  grant  for
three  years  (2001–2003).  The  grant  lapsed  in  2004  in  light  of  NIST  budget  con-
straints.
Q2. What do you think are the three most important things the Federal Government
needs  to  do  in  the  standards  and  trade  arena?  What  role  do  you  think  NIST
should play within the Federal Government and should NIST be doing anything
differently?

A2. The  three  most  important  things  the  U.S.  Government  should  to  in  the  stand-
ards and trade arena include:

1. Aggressively negotiating market access for U.S.-domiciled testing and certifi-
cation  providers  in  free  trade  agreements  (FTAs)  and  in  current  and  future
rounds  of  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO).  The  corollary  to  this  is  en-
suring trade partners’ compliance with related obligations. (See written testi-
mony for additional details.)

2. Enhanced  funding  for  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  (DOC)  (a)  Inter-
national  Trade  Administration  Standards  Liaison  Office  (b)  standards  at-
taches and (c) NIST Standards in Trade (SIT) workshops. (See written testi-
mony for additional details.)

3. Technical  assistance/capacity  building  components  (including  funding)  in
FTAs, Trade & Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs), and other bilat-
eral and regional trade agreements.

With  respect  to  standards  in  trade,  NIST  plays  an  important  role  as  the  U.S.
WTO  enquiry  point  for  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  (TBT).  It  is  a  rich  resource  for
U.S.  companies  seeking  timely  information  regarding  standards  and  regulatory  de-
velopments.

NIST  also  plays  an  important  role  in  the  commercialization  of  new  technologies
developed in the United States; this is through the development of related measure-
ment  standards.  Fuel  cells,  nanotechnology  and  biometrics  are  areas  in  which
NIST’s measurement standards work needs to be sustained, and perhaps enhanced.
Q3. We  are  facing  an  increasingly  global  marketplace,  how  do  you  see  U.S.-based

standards organizations evolving over the next five to ten years?

A3. Paths will vary for the evolution of U.S.-based standards organizations, in large
part  because  trends  and  issues  vary  by  sector.  But  in  general,  standards  develop-
ment  processes  increasingly  adapt  to  reflect  time-to-market  sensitivities  of  tech-
nology-driven sectors; technology itself is being used to improve the standards devel-
opment process.

One thing that should be enhanced and not changed is acceptance internationally
of  standards  developed  by  U.S.-domiciled  standards  development  organizations
(SDOs) in accordance with internationally accepted principles outlined in the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Annex 4. The key ten-
ants  of  standards  development—openness,  balance,  consensus,  and  due  process—
similarly will not change.

Underwriters  Laboratories  Inc.  (UL)’s  own  approach  to  standards  development
has  evolved  in  recent  years.  It  has  adopted  a  more  aggressive  policy  toward  stand-
ards harmonization within the IEC and ISO. U.S. manufacturers are realizing that
they have an increasingly global marketplace for their innovative and creative prod-
ucts.  UL’s  harmonization  priorities  rely  largely  on  what  industry  perceives  as  pri-
ority areas for harmonization.

When  developing  new  standards  or  harmonizing  UL’s  standards  at  the  regional
or  international  level,  however,  it  is  paramount  that  essential  U.S.  safety  principles
are  protected  and  not  compromised,  even  if  this  means  developing  National  Dif-
ferences,  a  practice  that  is  not  unique  to  the  United  States.  UL  considers  the
merit(s)  of  harmonizing  existing  standards,  whether  by  acceptance  of  IEC  and  ISO
requirements  or  by  advocating  a  UL  standard  or  its  essential  requirements  as  the
basis of the harmonized standard. UL will also develop ‘‘globally’’ relevant standards
in areas where standards do not exist.

U.S.  standards  development  organizations  (SDOs)  should  also  take  the  lead  in
submitting standards development proposals and requesting recognition of U.S. doc-

uments at the international level in such emerging national priority areas as home-
land security and nanotechnology. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is another
such area where the impact of standards on trade is potentially staggering.
Q4. Clearly,  the  commitment  to  technical  assistance  by  the  EU  is  unmatched  by  the
U.S. in its coordination and magnitude. Is it fair to say that the EU and Euro-
pean  industries  believe  that  they  can  create  a  competitive  advantage  in  world
markets by strongly influencing the content of international standards? Will the
mass  marketing  by  the  EU  of  selected  standards  create  a  preference  for  Euro-
pean  products  rather  than  U.S.  products?  If  so,  what  should  the  U.S.  be  doing
and why have we waited so long to take any action?

A4. Yes,  the  European  Union  aggressively  tries  to  influence  the  content  of  inter-
national standards, which can provide an advantage for related EU products in the
region  and  globally.  The  promotion  of  EU  standards,  especially  if  codified  in  IEC
and  ISO  standards  for  which  U.S.  standards  are  not  harmonized,  means  that  U.S.
manufacturers  must  adapt  products  typically  produced  according  to  U.S.  standards
if  they  want  to  compete  in  markets  whose  conformance  systems  are  based  on  EU
(and EU-based IEC and ISO) standards.

The  U.S.  Government  should  incorporate  technical  assistance  components—that
specifically address standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment sys-
tems—in  all  FTAs,  TIFAs,  and  other  bilateral  and  regional  trade  agreements  with
U.S. trade partners.
Q5. Do  China’s  laws  and  regulations  concerning  the  recognition  and  use  of  ‘‘inter-
national  standards’’  comply  with  their  commitments  under  the  WTO?  If  not,  is
this  discrepancy  a  problem  for  U.S.  industry  and  has  the  U.S.  Government
taken any action to respond to industry concerns?

A5. UL  has  not  undertaken  an  evaluation  of  China’s  laws  and  regulations  con-
cerning standards and whether they comply with WTO obligations. UL understands,
however, that China has publicly expressed a preference for IEC and ISO standards
(in general, but not across all sectors) and that it does not share the U.S. interpreta-
tion of WTO language defining ‘‘international standards.’’

With respect to testing and certification, China is obligated under its WTO acces-
sion commitments to accredit or recognize testing and certification organizations not
domiciled  in  China  for  the  purpose  of  administering  its  CCC  mark.  To  date,  no
timeline has been outlined to phase in these commitments, and existing PRC certifi-
cation  and  accreditation  regulations  preclude  non-Chinese  entities  from  providing
CCC  mark  testing  and  certification  services.  UL  thus  would  like  to  see  increased
dialogue  under  both  the  WTO  accession  Transitional  Review  Mechanism  and  the
Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade to develop a timeline for implementation
of  national  treatment  commitments  referenced  in  Paragraphs  194  and  195  of  Chi-
na’s Working Party Report.

When new PRC regulations took effect in early 2004, the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative  (USTR)  and  DOC  both  worked  with  UL  to  clarify  their  scope.  In
working bilateral meetings, it is UL’s understanding that the issue has been raised,
with no hard and fast commitments from the Chinese.
Q6. The National Technology Transfer Act promotes the use of private standards by
U.S. Government agencies. How successfully has this Act been implemented and
what improvement could be made to the Act?

A6. The  fundamental  intent  of  the  Act—to  promote  the  use  of  voluntary  consensus
standards, wherever appropriate—is on mark and should not be altered. Implemen-
tation  varies  by  agency,  but  it  is  clear  from  the  practice  of  the  Department  of  De-
fense (DOD) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that the NTTAA
has  been  effective  in  increasing  U.S.  Government  reliance  on  voluntary  consensus
standards, whenever possible, for both procurement and regulatory purposes.

With respect to improving implementation, NIST already is actively engaged with
private  sector  stakeholders  to  evaluate  options  for  enhancing  implementation.  One
of the thoughts to emerge from that dialogue is improving the role of the Standards
Executive within each federal agency. This includes adequate funding for their par-
ticipation as subject matter experts in related private sector standards development
processes, as well as addressing some of the organizational structure issues that can
frustrate their responsibilities.
Q7. We  are  having  conformity  assessment  problems  with  the  European  Union,  Mex-
ico  and  China.  Why  is  this  a  problem  for  U.S.  industry?  How  effective  has  the
Federal  Government  in  solving  these  problems  for  U.S.  industry?  What  should
we be doing differently?

A7. The  ‘‘conformity  assessment  problems’’  from  UL’s  perspective  relate  to  accredi-
tation of testing and certification organizations not domiciled in the country in ques-
tion.  ‘‘U.S.  industry’’  consists  of  the  product  manufacturers  for  which  organizations
like UL conduct testing and certification. If current practices in Europe, Mexico, and
China  (or  other  countries  with  local  product  certification  schemes,  for  that  matter)
delay  or  preclude  the  participation  of  testing  and  certification  organizations  domi-
ciled in other countries, then the ‘‘problem for U.S. industry’’ is that they must use
multiple  testing  and  certification  organizations  to  obtain  the  multiple  certification
marks  needed  to  sell  their  products  globally.  Allowing  local  accreditation  of  U.S.-
domiciled  testing  and  certification  organizations  means  that  manufacturers  can  re-
duce  the  number  of  certification  organizations  used  globally  and  that  organizations
like UL can bundle testing and help manufacturers reduce their overall global com-
pliance costs.

DOC and USTR have been very helpful to date in resolving issues in Mexico. UL
continues  to  work  with  DOC  and  USTR  on  issues  in  Europe  and  China.  As  noted
in  responses  to  questions  (2)  and  (5)  above,  UL  would  like  to  see  the  U.S.  Govern-
ment  take  a  more  aggressive  negotiating  stance  on  market  access  for  testing  and
certification  organizations  within  the  services  schedule  of  FTAs  and  future  rounds
of the WTO.
Q8. You  recommend  that  U.S.  stakeholders  should  work  to  ensure  that  trade  part-
ners comply with WTO principles of openness, transparency, and advance notice.
I  couldn’t  agree  more,  we  need  to  ensure  that  our  trading  partners  meet  their
obligations.  Could  you  provide  us  with  some  specifics  of  what  needs  to  be  done
by both industry and government to implement your recommendation?

A8. Industry  needs  to  improve  cooperation  with  foreign  counterparts  in  inter-
national  forums  to  support  and  encourage  compliance  with  WTO  principles.  Indus-
try  should  also  use  such  multinational  events  as  OECD-sponsored  conferences  as  a
platform  for  improved  compliance.  Industry  should  also  promptly  bring  non-compli-
ance issues to the attention of appropriate authorities in the U.S. Government.

UL  recommends  that  the  U.S.  Government  highlight  and  emphasize  WTO  Tech-
nical  Barriers  to  Trade  Agreement  compliance  principles  in  all  negotiated  agree-
ments. Emphasis should also be placed on education and technical support through
such organizations as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that
would  concentrate  on  best  practices  for  meeting  elements  of  trading  partners’  com-
mitments.  Related  compliance  issues  should  be  elevated  to  the  highest  levels  of  a
counterpart’s government to facilitate prompt attention and resolution of the issues
brought forward by industry and others.
Q9. Mr.  Bhatia,  you  recommend  increasing  funding  for  existing  government  stand-
ards programs. Which programs require increased funding and how much more
funding  do  they  need?  Also,  what  additional  activities  need  to  be  undertaken
with this additional funding?

A9.

• NIST Standards in Trade (SIT) Workshops: Recommend at least doubling the
funding  (and  staff,  as  appropriate)  to  accommodate  at  least  3–4  additional
programs  per  year.  UL  would  like  to  see  sufficient  funding  that  permits  3–
4  workshops  each  year  focused  on  new  sectors/regions  and  an  equal  number
of  workshops  that  build  on  previous  programs.  The  follow-on  programs  help
sustain momentum built in the initial sessions.
• DOC  International  Trade  Administration  (ITA)  Standards  Liaison:  UL  rec-
ommends authorizing funds that would enable the ITA Standards Liaison of-
fice to develop and implement a comprehensive training program for all ITA-
affiliated staff, including those in the Commercial Service. The pilot programs
have  proven  successful,  but  they  have  focused  on  foundational  concepts,
which  by  themselves  are  insufficient.  The  funding  should  facilitate  continu-
ation  of  the  core  101-level  programs,  while  enabling  the  development  of  pro-
grams targeting specific sectors and/or specific regions and countries. Funding
should  accommodate  both  classroom-style  and  web-based  training  sessions.
Adequate funding also means covering travel costs for U.S. Embassy and U.S.
Consulate-based  staff  to  participate  in  U.S.-based  or  region-based  classroom-
style sessions.
• Standards  Attaches:  UL  recommends  that  additional  funding  be  allocated  to
DOC  for  additional  standards  attache  positions  in  strategic  U.S.  embassies.
Re-instating the attache´ in Saudi Arabia and adding a new attache´ in Korea
would be of particular interest to UL.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  David  Karmol,  Vice  President,  Public  Policy  and  Government  Affairs,

American National Standards Institute

Questions submitted by the House Science Committee Majority
Q1. Are foreign governments using standards in a way that is inhibiting innovation,
competition,  respect  for  intellectual  property,  and  free  trade  in  products  where
the U.S. is competitive, and if so, how?

A1. As  reflected  in  my  testimony,  the  actions  of  some  governments  could  be  seen
to  be  anti-competitive.  Since  most  countries  are  WTO  signatories,  however,  stand-
ards  actions  are  almost  always  cast  as  necessary  for  national  security  or  to  reflect
regional or national needs, which are recognized as permissible under the WTO TBT
agreement. It is difficult for ANSI to describe specific instances where U.S. products
have  been  specifically  disadvantaged,  however,  in  those  few  cases  that  have  been
notified  to  us,  it  was  because  Europe  generally  develops  design  specific  standards
whereas  the  United  States  develops  performance  based  standards.  Specific  designs
can become technical barriers to trade.
Q2. Are foreign governments using standards policy as a mechanism to protect their
domestic industries at the expense of external competition, including competition
from U.S. companies?

A2. As  reflected  in  my  testimony,  ANSI  does  not  believe  that  other  countries  are
specifically  using  standards  policy  to  shelter  domestic  industries  However,  these
countries  may  well  be  attempting  to  advantage  their  domestic  producers  in  foreign
markets  through  the  aggressive  promotion  of  their  domestic  or  regional  standards,
in  the  same  way  the  U.S.  attempts  to  assist  its  industry  by  promoting  U.S.  devel-
oped standards, through outreach to developing and less-developed nations.
Q3. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, what, if anything, should the U.S.

Government be doing to respond?

A3. As I indicated in my written and oral testimony, ANSI believes that three gov-
ernment  actions  would  be  useful  in  addressing  the  standards  challenges  we  cur-
rently face:

1. Direct  support  for  the  U.S.  standards  system,  including  support  for  ANSI
participation  in  international  standards  forums,  support  for  outreach  and
standards  distribution  efforts,  and  increased  education  and  training  of  for-
eign service and foreign and commercial service officers in standards.

2. Increased  coordination  between  the  several  U.S.  Government  agencies  en-
gaged in standards activities, and their private sector counterparts and part-
ners.

3. Congressional  endorsement  of  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy,  a  document  re-
flecting  input  from  the  private  and  governmental  sectors,  which  lays  out  re-
sponsible  and  practical  strategies  to  address  current  standards  challenges
that  can  be  implements  jointly  by  the  private  sector  and  the  government,
working in close harmony.

Questions submitted by Representative David Wu
Q1. The  U.S.  Standards  Strategy  lays  out  a  series  of  ambitious  recommendations.
Aside from Congress endorsing the Strategy, will there be a follow-up document
laying  out  how  these  recommendations  should  be  implemented?  What  resources
will  be  required  to  implement  the  Strategy  and  what  does  the  Federal  Govern-
ment need to do?

A1. With  respect  to  the  initial  National  Standards  Strategy,  issued  in  2000,  ANSI
maintained  a  web-based  tracking  document  to  track  specific  actions  taken  in  fur-
therance of the strategy, both by ANSI and ANSI staff, and by government and pri-
vate sector standards participants. We anticipate using a similar system to monitor
actions taken pursuant to the U.S. Standards Strategy.

We  do  not  believe  significant  new  resources  are  needed  to  implement  the  U.S.
Standards Strategy, as most of the principles of the strategy reflect improved or co-
ordinated  efforts  where  current  efforts  are  ongoing.  However,  it  would  be  helpful  if
the  Federal  Government  would  take  on  some  additional  responsibility  to  support
outreach on standards, in terms of making selected standards available in U.S. Em-
bassies, supporting additional direct outreach programs, and encouraging better co-

operation  between  agencies  currently  engaged  in  promoting  use  of  U.S.  standards.
We  think  that  for  approximately  $10  million,  a  significant  desktop-downloadable,
U.S. standards collection could be placed in every embassy.
Q2. What do you think are the three most important things the Federal Government
needs  to  do  in  the  standards  and  trade  arena?  What  role  do  you  think  NIST
should play within the Federal Government and should NIST be doing anything
differently?

A2. As I indicated in my written and oral testimony, ANSI believes that three gov-
ernment  actions  would  be  useful  in  addressing  the  standards  challenges  we  cur-
rently face:

1. Direct  support  for  the  U.S.  standards  system,  including  support  for  ANSI
participation  in  international  standards  forums,  support  for  outreach  and
standards  distribution  efforts,  and  increased  education  and  training  of  for-
eign service and foreign and commercial service officers in standards.

2. Increased  coordination  between  the  several  U.S.  Government  agencies  en-
gaged in standards activities, and their private sector counterparts and part-
ners.

3. Congressional  endorsement  of  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy,  a  document  re-
flecting  input  from  the  private  and  governmental  sectors,  which  lays  out  re-
sponsible  and  practical  strategies  to  address  current  standards  challenges
that  can  be  implements  jointly  by  the  private  sector  and  the  government,
working in close harmony.

Q3. We  are  facing  an  increasingly  global  marketplace,  how  do  you  see  U.S.-based

standards organizations evolving over the next five to ten years?

A3. U.S.-based  standards  developers,  following  the  U.S.  Standards  Strategy,  will
continue to develop market relevant and globally relevant standards in future years,
in  accordance  with  requirements  of  the  WTO  Technical  Barriers  to  Trade  Agree-
ment.  They  will  continue  to  evolve  to  meet  market  requirements,  as  they  have  in
the past.
Q4. Clearly,  the  commitment  to  technical  assistance  by  the  EU  is  unmatched  by  the
U.S. in its coordination and magnitude. Is it fair to say that the EU and Euro-
pean  industries  believe  that  they  can  create  a  competitive  advantage  in  world
markets by strongly influencing the content of international standards? Will the
mass  marketing  by  the  EU  of  selected  standards  create  a  preference  for  Euro-
pean  products  rather  than  U.S.  products?  If  so,  what  should  the  U.S.  be  doing
and why have we waited so long to take any action?

A4. Standards can be used to facilitate trade or to create barriers. European compa-
nies  and  governments,  like  U.S.  companies  and  our  government,  would  like  to  see
standards  adopted  that  favor  their  respective  businesses  and  products.  The  Euro-
peans  have  become  more  aggressive  in  recent  years,  but  it  is  not  correct  that  the
U.S. has ‘‘waited too long to respond.’’ It is more accurate to say that the Europeans
have  succeeded  in  catching  up,  and  are  now  playing  the  standards  game  aggres-
sively.  The  U.S.  traditionally  had  been  the  world  leader  in  standards,  influencing
most  other  nations.  Now  there  are  several  centers  of  influence,  including  both  Eu-
rope  and  China.  However,  the  European  Commission  is  clearly  subsidizing  the  vol-
untary  standards  development  system  in  Europe,  and  promotion  of  the  European
Standards around the world. U.S. Government funding assistance of the U.S. stand-
ardization system would help to counterbalance the EC funding program.
Q5. Do  China’s  laws  and  regulations  concerning  the  recognition  and  use  of  ‘‘inter-
national  standards’’  comply  with  their  commitments  under  the  WTO?  If  not,  is
this  discrepancy  a  problem  for  U.S.  industry  and  has  the  U.S.  Government
taken any action to respond to industry concerns?

A5. China  appears  to  be  attempting  to  comply  with  the  WTO/TBT  agreement,  but
at  the  same  time  is  at  times  applying  a  somewhat  stretched  interpretation  of  sev-
eral  WTO/TBT  provisions,  in  order  to  help  domestic  industry.  We  believe  the  way
to  address  this  issue  is  through  continuous  engagement  of  the  Chinese,  and  a  uni-
form and consistent approach when dealing with them. There must be, and is, good
coordination  between  the  U.S.  Government  and  the  private  sector  participants  in
the standards community.
Q6. The National Technology Transfer Act promotes the use of private standards by
U.S. Government agencies. How successfully has this Act been implemented and
what improvement could be made to the Act?

101

A6. We  believe  that  the  NTTAA  has  been  a  great  success,  and  has  demonstrably
and  dramatically  increased  the  number  of  standards  adopted  by  and  used  by  Fed-
eral  Government  agencies.  The  implementation  has  been  good,  and  appears  to  be
increasingly  more  effective  as  time  passes  and  participants  and  agencies  gain  more
experience  and  understanding  of  voluntary  standards.  We  think  that  at  some  point
language  might  be  added  to  require  that  federal  agencies  also  use  Conformity  As-
sessment services (Certification and Accreditation of Certifiers) from the private sec-
tor,  in  the  same  way  that  the  law  now  requires  the  use  of  voluntary  consensus
standards  from  the  private  sector.  Many  agencies  are  already  using  such  services,
but  the  law  would  encourage  further  use  of  this  tool.  This  is  a  natural  extension
of the law, and would complement the use of private sector standards.
Q7. You  point  out  that  the  U.S.  standards  community  does  not  have  the  resources
to  match  the  investment  of  the  EU.  You  recommend  that  the  Federal  Govern-
ment provide funding for research, education, and technical support and for rep-
resentation at international standards meetings. How much funding is required
for this agenda and, among the numerous standards development organizations,
who should receive federal funding?

A7. As stated above, we believe an initial amount of $10 million would fund the set-
up  and  implementation  of  an  on-line  standards  resource  in  the  U.S.  embassies
around the world, and perhaps five million dollars per year beyond that for mainte-
nance  costs.  This  could  be  paid  to  ANSI,  since  a  standards  collection  is  available
from ANSI, but a large portion of the funding would be passed through to the stand-
ards  developers,  both  ANSI  accredited  and  not,  who  own  the  various  collections  of
standards hosted on ANSI’s website. This way the funding would go to those groups
whose  standards  were  most  sought  after  and  used,  rather  than  a  more  arbitrary
funding formula.
Q8. Over  the  past  10  years  what  has  been  the  trend  of  participation  in  U.S.  stand-
ards  setting  activities?  If  decreasing,  why  do  you  think  there  has  been  less  par-
ticipation  and  what  does  this  mean  for  U.S.-based  standards  organizations  in
the long-term?

A8. Unfortunately  the  trend  appears  to  be  one  of  decreasing  participation.  We  be-
lieve  this  is  a  result  of  number  of  factors,  including  the  downsizing  and  merging  of
corporations  over  the  last  ten  to  fifteen  years,  the  retirement  of  experienced  stand-
ards  participants,  without  such  participants  being  replaced,  the  lack  of  under-
standing  of  the  strategic  importance  of  standards  in  company  executive  suites,  and
the  general  move  to  cut  cost  where  the  activity  cannot  be  shown  to  contribute  di-
rectly to the bottom line. We believe that this trend must be reversed, or U.S.-based
standards  developers  will  have  increasing  difficulty  producing  the  high  quality
standards that the U.S. is known to produce.
Q9. As  we  are  trying  to  engage  the  Chinese  in  international  standards  committees,
I  understand  that  they  have  had  trouble  obtaining  entry  visas  for  meetings  in
the United States. What is the problem?

A9. Yes, we are fully engaging the Chinese in international standards activities and
forums.  There  have  been  some  recent  problems  with  visas,  which  apparently  arise
from  a  number  of  causes  and  are  being  addressed  aggressively  by  ANSI,  working
cooperatively  with  our  government  partners  in  the  Departments  of  State  and  Com-
merce.  Some  of  the  problems  can  be  traced  to  the  fact  that  applications  were  not
made  with  sufficient  lead  time  by  the  Chinese  delegates  involved.  Other  problems
apparently  were  a  result  of  slow  processing  of  the  applications  by  the  Chinese  au-
thorities  involved  in  processing  the  applications  internally.  Still  other  problems  ap-
parently  arose  from  delays  in  the  processing  of  applications  by  the  relevant  U.S.
agencies  and  offices.  All  of  these  problems  are  being  addressed  as  appropriate.  The
Department  of  State  has  been  responsive  in  assisting  ANSI  address  the  problems,
where they had the ability to assist.

DEERE RESPONSES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WORKSHOP QUESTIONS
Deere  provides  a  broad  variety  of  equipment  for  off-highway  applications  in  mar-
kets  around  the  world.  The  responses  to  the  questions  posed  by  the  Department  of
Commerce  are  often  different  based  upon  the  particular  type  of  equipment.  We  dif-
ferentiate  between  Agricultural  Tractors,  Agricultural  Harvesting  Equipment,  Con-
struction and Earthmoving Equipment and Grounds Care machines. Even on a glob-
al basis, the markets for this type of equipment is relatively low volume and capital
intensive  so  the  ideal  situation  for  us  is  a  portfolio  of  globally  accepted  standards
and  harmonized  regulations  by  product  type  where  compliance  would  allow  us  to
market  our  equipment  anywhere  in  the  world  without  modification  and  we  could
self-declare  our  compliance.  Any  unique  requirement,  whether  a  standard,  regula-
tion or test adds to our and therefore our customers cost and is something we strive
to  avoid.  As  a  result,  we  have  been  active  in  trying  to  create  standards  portfolios
in  ISO  to  best  meet  both  technical  and  political  requirements  and  minimize  trade
related  issues.  Based  on  equipment  types,  not  all  ISO  portfolios  provide  complete
machine  family  coverage  or  are  current  with  the  latest  technology.  In  responding
to the questions below, we will highlight those differences in more detail.

One other point is worth mentioning up front. The Off-highway Heavy Equipment
industry,  in  comparison  with  other  industries  such  as  Aerospace  or  Automotive  is
lightly regulated and as an industry, we prefer it that way. We have a long history
of  involvement  in  voluntary  standards  activities  as  a  means  of  self-regulation  to
meet  societal  concerns  including  safety  health  and  the  environment.  We  have  been
actively  involved  in  standards  development  at  both  the  national  and  international
level for more than 50 years. For that reason, many of our responses are based upon
real experience within the standards system.
1. What are the highest priority standards issues facing your industry?

There are two areas of concern: First are the horizontal type standards proposals
using  a  common  approach  or  setting  requirements  on  broad,  dissimilar  types  of  off
highway  equipment.  Examples  include  Environmental  type  standards  (and  Regula-
tions)  on  Engine  Emissions,  Fuels,  Environmental  Noise,  and  ‘‘End  of  Life’’  stand-
ards  that  place  additional  burdens  on  manufacturers.  While  we  are  not  opposed  to
goals  and  objectives  of  some  of  these  initiatives,  we  have  concerns  that  some  pro-
posals  will  not  yield  the  desired  results  and  some  timetables  put  our  industry  at
risk  of  survival  in  terms  of  our  abilities  to  recover  the  cost  of  the  R&D  investment
while  remaining  competitive  in  the  marketplace.  The  impacts  will  be  substantially
higher  product  cost  to  the  consumer  and  with  little  direct  value  perceived  by  the
customer,  even  though  society  in  general  may  benefit.  We  would  prefer  a  more
vertical product oriented approach to standards and regulation so the solutions can
be more effectively tailored to product use.

The second concern is the pace of standards development covering use of emerging
technologies. For example, the development of intelligent agricultural systems is far
out-pacing  the  development  of  standards  for  such  applications.  The  concern  is  not
about  the  technology,  it  is  about  the  availability  of  expert  resources  and  the  pace
of  standards  development  to  fill  gaps  in  the  portfolio.  Our  inability  to  keep  pace
with voluntary standards may give rise to regulatory proposals.
2. Are  there  adequate  national  and/or  international  standards  to  satisfy

your industry’s trade/export-related needs?
For  Agricultural  Tractors:  No.  International  standards  are  either  lacking,  unac-
ceptable due to being design specific as opposed to performance based, or are biased
to the European approach based on the European regulations for Agricultural Trac-
tors.  Tractors  made  to  existing  U.S.  National  Standards  are  at  risk  in  trade  due  to
politically motivated preferences for European or ISO references.

For Ag Harvesting equipment, the International portfolio is improving but not yet
complete, with most of the work being done between CEN and ISO utilizing the Vi-
enna Agreement.

In  the  Earthmoving  equipment  sector,  the  portfolio  of  ISO  standards  is  meeting
most  of  the  needs  and  doing  a  good  job  of  keeping  up  with  changing  and  emerging
requirements.
3. Does  your  industry  experience  standards-related  problems  in  specific
countries or regions, or do these problems affect multiple regions? What
is the definition of problem?
Yes  and  Yes.  We  have  standards  related  problems  regarding  road  regulations
across  Europe  for  all  types  of  equipment.  Likewise  we  are  having  country  specific
problems  forcing  machine  modifications  in  countries  such  as  Japan  and  Australia

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00137 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

134

to  satisfy  specific  road  regulations.  A  harmonized  approach  to  on-road  use  of  off-
highway equipment would save millions. From a regional perspective, the European
Union  creates  the  biggest  challenge  due  to  the  design  specific  regulations  that  are
imposed, or with requirements that make sense in densely populated Europe but are
not relevant in other market areas around the world.

Another  problem  is  that  some  regions  of  the  world  have  been  reluctant  to  adopt
ISO standards, preferring instead to adopt unique country or regional requirements.
This  is  complicated  by  the  fact  that  the  EU  and  its  member  states  fund  an  active
campaign  to  promote  their  Directives  and  standards,  seeking  preference  for  Euro-
pean made products and the U.S. has no equivalent effort.
4. Do your industry’s problems result primarily from the technical require-
ments  contained  in  standards  or  technical  regulations  that  adopt  such
standards?  Please  describe  specific  examples  where  the  technical  re-
quirements resulted in market entry problems in your industry.
Both.  Technical  differences  cause  problems  and  expense  regardless.  For  example,
in  the  European  Union  the  regulations  limit  the  width  of  a  machine  to  2.5  meters.
This is an old approach Directive. The John Deere 8000T (Track) machine width ex-
ceeded  the  restriction  by  50  mm.  Even  though  the  width  was  of  no  consequence  in
other  markets  around  the  world,  the  machine  had  to  be  redesigned  to  satisfy  the
EU  requirement  or  individually  homologated  with  each  EU  member  body.  Addi-
tional examples include the height from the ground restrictions on headlight instal-
lations for European tractors, ladder step height on self-propelled harvesting equip-
ment  such  as  combines  that  are  also  different  than  the  same  requirement  for  trac-
tors.  The  European  requirement  for  non-rotating  guards  and  guards  that  must  be
fixed  or  require  a  tool  to  open  continue  to  contentious  issues  as  far  as  global  rel-
evancy of the requirement is concerned.

Another very current example involves CEN 474–3 Loaders, currently under revi-
sion.  In  the  revision  the  secondary  exit  opening  is  being  reduced  from  the  dimen-
sional  criteria  of  ISO  2867.  This  change  will  result  in  the  secondary  exit  opening
of  compact  machines  (such  as  skid  steer  loaders)  currently  in  production  and  use
without reported or known problems being considered inappropriate for the EU mar-
ket.  This  trade  barrier  will  permit  one  major  manufacturer  (JCB  in  UK)  to  be  in
compliance because their design configuration currently meets the new requirement.
There are many other specific examples that can be cited.
5. Do your industry’s problems result from how compliance with technical
requirements  is  assessed?  Do  you  have  examples  of  cases  where  either
the technical requirements or the assessment process resulted in market
entry problems for your industry?
Conformity Assessment requirements are an issue. The European Union ‘‘Old Ap-
proach,’’  which  still  covers  Agricultural  Tractors  mandates  third-party  certification
and ‘‘Type approval’’ for products to enter their market. Australia has recently start-
ed  to  require  ‘‘risk  assessment’’  decisions  to  be  documented  and  approved  before
products  can  be  offered  for  sale.  Taiwan  has  proposed  mandatory  ISO  9000  certifi-
cation  for  Companies  who  want  to  sell  in  their  market.  Several  South  American
countries are considering similar requirements.

We  believe  strongly  in  the  principle  of  Supplier’s  Declaration  of  Conformity  or
SDOC.  This  applies  to  all  of  our  products  as  well  as  our  internal  processes.  We’ve
spent  nearly  167  years  building  our  brand  reputation  internationally  and  see  little
added value in third party assessment that is not as robust as our own testing. Any
requirement  for  mandatory  third-party  assessment  by  any  government  around  the
world  gets  our  attention.  We  further  support  the  principle  of  one  test  accepted  ev-
erywhere and offer the acceptance of OECD tractor tests (even though it is a third-
party certification methodology) by 30 countries around the world as an example of
a success story in this regard.
6. Has  your  industry  been  able  to  take  an  effective  approach  to  address
international standards issues? What steps have produced the most ben-
efit? Could other industrial sectors benefit from using these approaches?
The Construction and Earthmoving Equipment industry sector has for years been
actively  participating  and  leading  the  creation  and  adoption  of  ISO  standards  for
Construction  and  Forestry  equipment.  As  a  result,  that  industry  sector  has  a  port-
folio  of  ISO  standards  in  place.  This  approach  has  been  very  effective  and  has  in-
cluded the EU member states in the process. The key to effectiveness has been the
commitment  of  subject  matter  experts  to  key  committees  (TC  127  and  its  sub-
committees and working groups), staying involved on a continuous basis and taking
leadership  roles  occasionally  to  keep  the  agenda  moving.  The  only  problems  we’ve

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00138 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

135

experienced  with  this  approach  has  been  since  the  development  of  EU  New  Ap-
proach. The EU members often take a position that the ISO standard should mirror
the regional requirements of the EU. If they are unsuccessful, they adopt ‘‘amended’’
ISO  standards  with  regional  differences  or  they  create  CEN  standards  because  the
ISO standards will not meet their regional requirements. This is done after the glob-
al  community  has  rejected  the  EU  proposals  as  not  performance  based  but  design
based  or  purely  regional  opinions.  The  EU  process  for  creating  ‘‘amended’’  ISO
standards  or  CEN  standards  is  limited  to  EU  member  bodies  and  prohibits  review
or comments from other industry experts outside the EU member bodies during de-
velopment. In spite of this concern, which we have been attempting to address with
both  CEN  and  ISO  through  ANSI,  this  is  an  excellent  model  for  other  sectors  to
emulate.

On  the  other  hand,  the  agricultural  machinery  sector  has  not  been  very  serious
in the development of globally acceptable international standards. Differences in re-
gional  farming  practice  led  to  the  development  of  regional  or  national  standards.
Within the last few years however, globalization of markets, economic pressures and
industry consolidations have made a portfolio of globally accepted standards for Ag-
ricultural  Equipment  an  important  priority.  Just  recently  changes  have  been  initi-
ated  in  the  industry  SDO  (ASAE)  to  adopt  procedures  for  the  national  adoption  of
ISO  standards.  In  addition,  the  SDO  standards  committee  structure  has  been  reor-
ganized  in  order  to  allow  for  the  integration  of  the  U.S.  TAG  with  the  associated
ASAE  committees.  While  it  is  premature  to  evaluate  the  benefits,  it  is  expected  to
improve focus on the development of an international portfolio. The approach is now
similar to the Earthmoving equipment model and certainly could be applied to other
sectors.  Again,  the  key  is  committing  subject  matter  experts  from  industry  to  par-
ticipate but this has become somewhat problematic as the economic conditions with-
in  the  industry  and  consolidation  of  equipment  producing  companies  has  reduced
the pool of resources as well as the economic support for the standards development
organizations.
7. Has your industry been able to take an effective approach to address na-
tional  standards  issues?  What  steps  have  produced  the  most  benefit?
Could other industrial sectors benefit from using these approaches?
Over the years our industry has gotten good service from the SDOs we’ve chosen
to  use  in  the  U.S.  national  arena.  The  Society  of  Automotive  Engineers  (SAE)  and
the  American  Society  of  Agricultural  Engineers  (ASAE)  have  been  our  primary
SDOs, with ASTM, ASME, NFPa, IEEE and others playing lesser more focused but
none-the-less  important  roles.  The  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)
also  plays  a  key  role.  Populating  key  committees  with  subject  matter  experts  and
taking  leadership  roles  has  been  most  productive  in  producing  the  standards  that
meet  our  business  needs  as  well  as  those  of  society  in  general.  Needs  change  how-
ever,  and  now,  with  few  product  offerings  being  produced  exclusively  for  national
markets only, national standards are becoming less relevant for the reasons implied
in  the  opening  paragraph.  Building  products  to  standards  acceptable  in  more  mar-
kets  just  makes  good  economic  sense.  That  said,  the  ability  of  International  stand-
ards  bodies  (ISO  and  IEC  primarily)  to  develop  or  maintain  standards  fast  enough
to  keep  up  with  technology  and  technology  application  development  is  not  good
enough  to  eliminate  a  role  for  other  standards  developers.  Therefore  we  will  con-
tinue  to  support  some  key  nationally  based  standards  developers  and,  where  their
documents  are  globally  accepted  and  utilized,  support  them  as  internationally  ac-
ceptable.

We  also  believe  strongly  that  the  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)
plays  a  strategic  and  indispensable  role  in  addressing  both  national  and  inter-
national  standards  issues.  As  a  private  sector  federation  of  standards  producers
(SDOs), users (Industry and Government) as well as consumer interests, ANSI rep-
resents a consistently available forum for discussion and debate on standards issues
by  a  broad  cross  section  of  stakeholders,  and  the  one  best  place  to  develop  a  single
U.S. position on international issues. As our national member body to ISO and IEC,
they  are  both  a  source  of  intelligence  for  global  standards  issues  and  represent  the
only  channel  for  direct  representation  of  U.S.  positions  on  key  international  stand-
ards  committees.  Because  of  our  interest  in  globally  acceptable  technical  standards
for the Earth-moving industry, we found value in ANSI membership relatively early
in  our  involvement  with  standards.  Now,  with  an  even  greater  array  of  our  indus-
try’s  products  impacted  by  a  globally  relevant  and  acceptable  technical  standards
portfolio, we see even greater value in ANSI participation.
8. Do you have examples of a problem experienced by your industry where
the Federal Government has been effective in resolving the issues? What

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 14:43 Nov 05, 2005 Jkt 020998 PO 00000 Frm 00139 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\ETS05\051105\20998 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

136

steps  taken  by  Federal  Government  officials  were  effective  in  resolving
the issue, and why were they effective? Would such steps or approaches
be  applicable  in  other  cases  or  were  their  success  unique  to  a  specific
problem?  What  steps  were  ineffective  or  less  effective,  and  why  do  you
think  that  this  was  so?  Was  it  the  unique  nature  of  the  problem,  or
would such steps have been equally ineffective in most cases?
Deere  (and  the  off  highway  heavy  equipment  industry)  has  been  and  continues
to  be  supportive  of  the  TABD  process.  TABD  brings  industry  leaders  from  the  U.S.
and  Europe  together  with  government  officials  from  both  continents  to  identify  pri-
ority  issues  around  standards  and  regulatory  harmonization,  then  set  timetables
and provide project management oversight for quick resolution to improve trade and
commerce.  Our  experience  has  shown  that  government  to  government  discussions,
when  focused  on  the  right  issues  and  aligned  with  standard  and  regulatory  discus-
sions at the working level, can clear away the often bureaucratic obstacles that slow
down or stall problem resolution at the industry level.

TABD  discussions  initiated  efforts  to  harmonize  requirements  and  timetables  for
Diesel Engine Emission requirements between the U.S. and the EU with some suc-
cess so far. Another example of success from government involvement was the post-
ponement of Metric labeling requirements that were to be imposed by the European
Union until 2009. There have been many others.

We  believe  that  to  overcome  systemic  differences  in  approaches  to  standards  and
regulation  between  the  U.S.  and  our  overseas  trading  partners  requires  more  gov-
ernment  understanding  of  Industry  issues  and  better  coordination  of  strategies  to
protect  U.S.  based  company  competitiveness  abroad.  However,  success  will  only
come from understanding and respecting the differences between the sectors. As in-
dicated above, even within one definition of industry sector (like Off-highway Heavy
Equipment)  one  size  does  not  fit  all  when  it  comes  to  standards  and  regulations.
Requirements  vary  by  product,  their  intended  uses  by  customers  and  the  environ-
ment  where  they  are  used.  The  differences  are  even  more  pronounced  between  in-
dustry sectors like Automotive, Aerospace, Information Technology or Telecommuni-
cations. Too often we seem to want a ‘‘one size fits all’’ approach with a result that
satisfies no one.
9. What  actions  would  you  recommend  the  Department  undertake?  Would
your  industry  be  willing  to  help  to  improve  the  situation  encountered
with  respect  to  problems  associated  with  standards  and  conformity  as-
sessment?
Our  experiences  to  date  with  the  responsiveness  of  the  DOC,  the  ITA  and  the
USTR have been positive. Our frustrations stem from the lack of similar responsive-
ness from other regulatory agencies such as EPA, MSHA and OSHA to trade related
issues. Interagency coordination must improve if we are to have any hope of success
in  keeping  U.S.  manufacturing  competitive  and  the  global  playing  field  level  in
terms of standards and regulations. We believe it will take a commitment to coordi-
nation at the Cabinet level to substantially improve cooperation.

Another  issue  is  the  depth  of  understanding  of  industry  sector  differences  within
the  Agencies.  As  indicated  above,  different  sectors  and  even  different  product  ori-
ented  sub-sectors  have  different  needs  in  terms  of  problem  resolution  relating  to
standards,  regulations  and  conformity  assessment.  The  Department  may  need  to
consider  more  specific  focus  and/or  training  of  its  resources  to  more  effectively  pro-
vide response to issues.

A third issue is a reactive mindset as opposed to a proactive one. Industry, driven
by  performance  requirements  to  keep  investors  happy,  tends  to  avoid  problems
through  pre-emptive  action.  Government  seems  to  be  set  up  to  respond  only  when
problems occur, not to prevent them from occurring. We would recommend working
more closely with industry, relative to standards, regulations and conformity assess-
ment to head off problems more effectively.

We believe our industry has a very positive track record, providing resources and
working  both  nationally  and  internationally  to  resolve  our  own  problems  when  it
comes  to  standards,  regulations  and  conformity  assessment.  We  are  only  calling  on
government  to  assist  us  in  knocking  down  barriers  or  resistance  we  have  been  un-
successful  in  resolving  by  ourselves.  Consistent  with  our  track  record,  we  are  cer-
tainly  willing  to  cooperate  with  the  DOC  and  other  key  agencies  to  improve  the  ef-
fectiveness of U.S. influence in standards and conformity assessment in both the na-
tional and international arena.

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM PRIMOSCH, SENIOR DIRECTOR

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS POLICY

NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS

On  behalf  of  the  National  Association  of  Manufacturers,  I  thank  the  Sub-
committee  for  providing  the  opportunity  of  submitting  a  written  statement  for  the
record on how the United States should respond to trade barriers arising from tech-
nical standards in Europe and China.

The  NAM  is  the  Nation’s  largest  multi-industry  trade  association,  representing
small and large manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states. In re-
cent  years,  our  members  have  expressed  increasing  concern  about  the  impact  that
international  standards  and  government-mandated  technical  requirements,  and
their  application,  have  on  companies’  ability  to  market  their  products  and  services
abroad and access foreign products here at home.

As the Senior Director for International Business Policy, I have responsibility for
helping  members  address  these  concerns  and  coordinating  a  special  NAM  Working
Group on International Standards and Regulatory Policies. I also serve on the Board
of Directors of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the U.S. Gov-
ernment’s Industry Trade Advisory Committee for Standards (ITAC 16).
Importance of Standards and Technical Regulations in Trade

Technical  standards  play  an  essential  role  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  ensuring
inter-operability, consumer acceptance and fulfillment of health, safety and environ-
mental requirements. Standards facilitate the sale of manufactured products within
the national economy and in foreign markets around the world and enable our com-
panies  to  achieve  enormous  production  efficiencies  through  the  operation  of  global
supply chains.

About two-thirds of all U.S. exports and imports are manufactured goods so stand-
ards play a vital role in our nation’s international trade. When standards and tech-
nical  regulations  become  impediments  to  trade,  this  is  a  concern  for  not  only  the
manufacturing sector but also the broader U.S. economy.

The WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) established
disciplines aimed at ensuring that countries do not use standards, technical regula-
tions  and  their  application  through  conformity  assessment  procedures  to  create  un-
necessary  obstacles  to  international  trade.  The  TBT  Agreement  includes  a  number
of  provisions  important  for  U.S.  manufacturers,  notably  in  Article  2  relating  to  the
preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations by central government
bodies.  For  example,  the  agreement  specifies  that  technical  regulations  ‘‘shall  not
be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective.’’ Also, where
international  standards  exist  or  are  imminent,  the  agreement  requires  that  these
standards  be  used  instead  of  unique  national  standards,  unless  justified  by  specific
reasons.  Another  useful  guideline  in  the  agreement  is  that  WTO  members  are  ex-
pected  to  specify  technical  regulations  based  on  product  requirements  in  terms  of
performance rather than design.

The TBT Agreement has helped to prevent egregious attempts by governments to
use  standards  and  technical  regulations  as  tools  to  limit  market  access  and  protect
local  industry.  But  problems,  often  of  a  serious  nature,  persist.  Our  members  en-
counter trade barriers related to standards, technical regulations and conformity as-
sessment procedures in markets around the world, including with our NAFTA part-
ners.  However,  problems  in  China  and  the  European  Union  are  of  special  concern
because  of  the  volume  of  trade  affected  and  the  prospect  that  these  problems  will
worsen in the years ahead.
China

In  little  over  a  decade,  China  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  largest  global  producers
of manufactured goods and one of the largest global traders. In 2004 China ranked
third  in  world  trade,  with  exports  and  imports  totaling  $1.2  trillion.  China  benefits
enormously  from  the  international  standards  system.  By  manufacturing  to  inter-
national  standards,  Chinese  products  are  accepted  around  the  world  and  are  now
integrated  into  the  global  supply  chain  of  many  U.S.  retailers  and  multinational
manufacturing businesses.

Chinese exports to the United States amounted to $197 billion in 2004 and, if cur-
rent trends continue, will increase to around $250–$270 billion in 2005. U.S. exports
to China, on the other hand, amounted to only $35 billion in 2004. Even if U.S. ex-
ports grow at the high end of projections to $45 billion in 2005, this would still leave
a trade deficit of $205–$225 billion. In 2004, U.S. products accounted for only eight
percent of China’s total imports. In comparison, Japanese products accounted for 17
percent of China’s total imports and European products, 13 percent.

It  is  in  this  context  of  a  large  trade  imbalance  and  modest  market  penetration
that U.S. manufacturers view growing problems relating to standards, technical reg-
ulations  and  conformity  assessment  procedures  in  China.  Our  members  are  con-
cerned about the impact that these problems are having on market access now and
how they will affect market access to the world’s fast-growing large economy in the
future.

Several kinds of problems have come to our attention.

• China  is  creating  unique  national  standards.  One  prominent  example
was  China’s  attempt  to  set  a  unique  national  standard  for  so-called  WIFI  or
WAPI technology (WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure) different
from  international  standards.  As  part  of  the  requirement,  U.S.  firms  would
have  had  to  partner  with  selected  Chinese  companies  and  share  proprietary
technical  product  specifications.  China  postponed  implementing  the  standard
after strong protests from the U.S. Government.

• Obtaining  the  China  CCC  quality  mark  is  difficult.  China  has  estab-
lished  a  cumbersome  and  expensive  system  for  obtaining  the  China  Compul-
sory  Certification  mark  (similar  to  the  EU’s  CE  mark)  as  an  indication  that
regulatory  requirements  have  been  met.  Only  Chinese  testing  firms  can  cer-
tify  for  the  CCC  mark,  and  Chinese  inspectors  must  inspect  overseas  fac-
tories.

• Chinese  standards  bodies  lack  transparency.  Unlike  U.S.  standards  de-
velopment  organizations,  Chinese  SDOs  do  not  allow  participation  by  foreign
stakeholders  and  publish  little  information  on  the  standards  development
process until it is nearly complete.

• Market  Access  for  U.S.  testing  firms  is  restricted.  U.S.  testing  and  cer-
tification companies cannot operate in China. Products must be tested by Chi-
nese  companies,  often  at  higher  charges  and  with  extended  delays  that  raise
costs for manufacturers.

A  broader  and  more  fundamental  concern  is  that  China  seems  to  be  pursuing  a
deliberate  strategy  to  establish  standards  that  gives  competitive  advantage  to  Chi-
nese technology and domestically produced manufactured goods over technology and
products from the United States and other industrial countries. Efforts to establish
a unique WAPI standard is seen as one example. Others include Chinese promotion
of third-generation mobile telephone standards, use of Linux systems over Windows
operating system and work on radio frequency identification tagging and other infor-
mation technology standards.

Since  China  is  becoming  both  the  largest  producing  and  consuming  market  for
many  types  of  products  (e.g.,  mobile  phones,  computers,  telecommunications  equip-
ment,  cars  and  power  generation  equipment),  it  has  the  potential  to  exert  strong
market  power.  If  the  Chinese  were  to  succeed  in  establishing  unique  Chinese  na-
tional  standards  and  promote  these  standards  internationally,  this  could  have  a
major  impact  on  market  access  for  U.S.  technology  and  products,  particularly  in
high-technology sectors.
European Union

U.S. manufacturers confront a different set challenges with the 25-member Euro-
pean  Union  (EU)  trade  community.  Concerns  about  the  EU  generally  relate  to  four
issues:

• The  EU’s  top-down  approach  to  setting  standards,  which  differs  from  our
more open bottom-up, market-driven system, and its restrictions on access to
standards-setting bodies.

• Approaches  to  health,  safety  and  environmental  regulation  that  diverge  from
those  in  the  United  States,  and  the  expansion  of  products  subject  to  regula-
tion.

• Its  influence  in  international  standards  bodies,  such  as  the  Organization  for
International Standardization (ISO) and International Electro-Technical Com-
mission (IEC), in promoting standards more closely aligned to its own.

• The generous financial support for outreach programs on standards and regu-
lation  to  important  emerging  markets  (e.g.,  South  America,  China  and  other
newly industrializing Asian countries) and its growing influence on standards
and regulatory policies of these countries.

Top-Down Approach to Standards-Setting

As  part  of  its  effort  to  create  a  single  European  market  in  which  products  can
move freely among member states, the EU has favored a more centralized, top-down
approach to standards-setting that differs fundamentally from the U.S. system. The
EU encourages European industry to work through a small number of standards de-
velopment organizations, of which CEN and CENELEC are the two most prominent.
In  this  way  the  EU  is  able  to  develop  community-wide  standards  that  are  used
throughout  the  EU  and  avoid  the  proliferation  of  national  standards  that  may  be
incompatible. The United States, on the other hand, has over 400 recognized stand-
ards development organizations based on sectoral interests.

Some U.S. manufacturers, particularly large multi-nationals with well established
operations  in  Europe,  find  that  they  can  participate  effectively  in  the  EU  system
and  protect  their  interests.  Other  companies,  notably  small  firms  without  a  manu-
facturing  presence  in  Europe,  complain  that  their  access  to  the  standards-develop-
ment  process  is  severely  limited  and  that  the  process  lacks  transparency.  U.S.
standards development organizations tend to be sector-based and more open to par-
ticipation  of  all  stakeholders,  whether  foreign  or  domestic.  Many  manufacturers,
both large and small, see the EU standards systems as biased to the standards pref-
erences of European industry.

Divergent Approaches to Product Regulation

Overall  European  industry  is  more  highly  regulated  than  industry  in  the  United
States.  A  particularly  difficult  challenge  for  U.S.  manufacturers,  however,  is  the
growing divergence in regulatory approaches. Divergent approaches increase manu-
facturing  costs  because  manufacturers  must  comply  with  different  national  regula-
tions for producing and selling their products. Divergent regulations can also create
trade barriers that restrict market access or block it altogether. Here are four exam-
ples.

• The  EU’s  Restriction  on  Hazardous  Substances  in  electrical  and  electronic
equipment  (RoHS)  will  ban  the  use  of  lead  in  2006  in  most  electrical  equip-
ment  and  electronic  components  regardless  of  risk.  The  United  States  effec-
tively  employs  risk  assessment  tools  to  protect  consumers  and  the  environ-
ment  and  allow  continued  lead  use.  A  number  of  U.S.  manufacturers  have
told  us  that  they  will  have  to  stop  exporting  to  Europe  because  they  are  un-
able to manufacture their products without lead or cannot obtain inputs that
are lead-free.
• The  EU  is  considering  a  much  different  approach  to  testing  and  registering
potentially  hazardous  chemicals  than  we  have  in  the  United  States.  A  new
proposal  now  before  the  European  Parliament  and  EU  Council  of  Ministers
called  REACH  (Registration,  Evaluation  and  Authorization  of  Chemicals  Di-
rective)  would  establish  an  expensive,  complicated  process  of  registering  and
testing  chemicals  that  experts  say  will  not  result  in  greater  protection  of
health and the environment but will limit trade and industry competitiveness.
Some  small  U.S.  chemical  manufacturers  have  told  us  that  they  would  have
to  stop  exporting  to  Europe  because  the  regulatory  costs  would  be  so  great.
• Despite  years  of  discussion  in  the  Transatlantic  Business  Dialogue  and  offi-
cial channels, the United States and Europe have made little progress in har-
monizing  auto  safety  standards  although  safety  goals  of  regulators  are  quite
similar.  As  a  result,  U.S.  and  European  auto  makers  must  design  and  build
vehicles  that  have  significantly  different  technical  requirements,  raising  pro-
duction costs and making the companies less globally competitive.
• The EU continues to espouse a non-science-based ‘‘precautionary principle’’ in
restricting  certain  kinds  of  products,  such  as  products  containing  genetically
modified  organisms  (GMOs)  and  hormone-treated  beef,  even  though  no  ad-
verse health or environmental effects can be proven.

EU Influence in International Standards Bodies

Another  concern  of  U.S.  manufacturers  is  that  European  countries  appear  to  be
more successful in promoting European standards in international standards bodies,
particularly the ISO and IEC. Too often, some companies allege, ISO standards are
more closely aligned to European standards than to those used in the United States.
The  fact  that  the  ISO  operates  by  a  ‘‘one-country,  one-vote’’  rule  is  cited  as  giving
EU  members  unfair  advantage.  The  voting  record  in  these  organizations  does  not
reflect a pattern of ‘‘bloc’’ voting but the perception nonetheless exists that EU mem-
bers  are  working  together  to  promote  European  standards  in  these  organizations.
Another  practical  advantage  that  European  countries  have  in  the  ISO  and  IEC  is

140

that the two organizations are located in the heart of Europe and European govern-
ments  support  the  budgets  of  European  standards  development  organizations,  thus
facilitating  more  active  European  participation.  The  burden  of  financing  U.S.  par-
ticipation in the ISO and IEC falls on the private sector.

EU Support for International Outreach on Standards

Finally, U.S. manufacturers note that European governments and the EU’s Euro-
pean  Commission  provide  generous  funding  for  international  outreach  to  promote
European  standards  and  regulatory  approaches  in  emerging  markets,  such  as
China, South America, North Africa and the Middle East. EU and national govern-
ment  funding  pays  for  technical  assistance,  travel  of  foreign  standards  experts  to
Europe and the placement of European standards abroad. The prospect that emerg-
ing  markets  may  be  considering  adoption  of  EU  regulatory  approaches,  such  as
REACH  and  RoHS,  is  a  matter  of  particular  concern  because  they  could  signifi-
cantly  restrict  market  access  for  U.S.  manufactured  products.  The  NAM  does  not
have a detailed breakdown of European funding for outreach but knows that it runs
into  the  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  and  vastly  exceeds  the  funding  available  to  U.S.
agencies (e.g., NIST and USAID) for such programs.

Recommended Responses—the New ‘‘United States Standards Strategy’’

Standards  and  regulatory  developments  in  China  and  the  EU  call  for  a  strong
U.S. private sector and government response to ensure that U.S. economic interests
are  protected.  Under  the  leadership  of  the  American  National  Standards  Institute
(ANSI), some 50 U.S. business, government and non-governmental organization rep-
resentatives participated in a review of the 2000 National Standards Strategy. I was
a  member  of  the  review  committee  and  chaired  the  subgroup  on  international
issues. Reflecting on standards developments over the past four years in the United
States  and  abroad,  including  those  in  China  and  the  EU,  the  group  substantially
revised the strategy and renamed it the ‘‘United States Standards Strategy’’ (USSS)
with a view to emphasizing the U.S. approach to developing standards for the global
marketplace, and not solely for the national market.

The USSS, which is still in the final review process, calls for action in four areas

that are relevant to China and EU standards issues identified in this statement.

• Actively  promote  the  consistent  application  of  international  recognized  prin-
ciples  in  the  development  of  standards,  notably  those  contained  in  the  WTO
TBT Agreement.
• Encourage  common  governmental  approaches  to  the  use  of  voluntary  con-
sensus  standards  as  tools  for  meeting  regulatory  needs,  thus  reducing  the
possibility of regulatory differences creating trade barriers.
• Work  to  prevent  standards  and  their  application  from  becoming  technical
trade  barriers  to  U.S.  products  and  services,  taking  a  vigorous  pro-active  ap-
proach  that  recognizes  the  growing  importance  of  standards  for  market  ac-
cess.
• Strengthen international outreach programs to promote understanding of how
voluntary,  consensus-based,  market-driven  sectoral  standards  processes  can
benefit  businesses,  consumers  and  society  as  whole,  in  recognition  that  more
needs  to  be  done  by  both  the  government  and  private  sector  to  communicate
the U.S. perspective on standards.

We  believe  that,  when  finally  adopted,  the  USSS  will  provide  a  highly  useful
guide  for  developing  responses  to  market  access  concerns  relating  to  standards  not
only in China and the EU but also in other key foreign markets.

The Subcommittee’s hearing provides a timely opportunity to educate Members of
Congress,  government  agencies,  the  business  community  and  general  public  on  the
importance  of  international  standards  and  regulation  for  trade  and  the  need  to  en-
sure  effective  public  and  private  sector  support  for  the  U.S.  standards  system  and
its role in the global marketplace. We applaud the Subcommittee for taking the ini-
tiative on this matter.
