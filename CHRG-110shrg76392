THE  IMPACT  OF  MEDIA  VIOLENCE  ON 

CHILDREN 

TUESDAY,  JUNE  26,  2007 

COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION, 

The  Committee  met,  pursuant  to  notice,  at  10:10  a.m.  in  room 
SR–253,  Russell  Senate  Office  Building,  Hon.  John  D.  Rockefeller 
IV, presiding. 

U.S. SENATE, 

Washington, DC. 

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order.  Senator 
Inouye, the Chairman of the Committee, has asked me to open this 
morning’s hearing on the impact of media violence on children. 

I’m  very  pleased  to  welcome  our  witnesses  today.  I  know  many 

of you have traveled from across the country to be here today. 

Before  I  start,  I  would  like  to  mention  that  FCC—Chairman 
Kevin  Martin  could  not  be  here  today.  He  wanted  to  be  here,  was 
planning  to  be  here,  but  his  several  day  old  young  son,  as  of  last 
night,  remains  in  intensive  care,  and  so,  it  is  entirely  understand-
able that he would not be here. So, we wish he and Catherine and 
the little boy, William, all the best. 

I also have to recognize the work of Commissioner Copps on this 
issue.  Unfortunately,  Commissioner  Copps  also  could  not  be  here 
today, due to other, as they say, pressing FCC business. But he has 
been  a  genuine  leader  and  an  advocate  on  this  issue,  as  I  think 
most of you know. 

The  issue  of  protecting  children  from  indecent,  violent,  and  pro-
fane  content  is  a  deeply  personal  and  important  issue  to  this  Sen-
ator.  Last  Congress,  I  introduced  legislation  to  address  this  issue, 
and  I  will  do  so  again  in  the  coming  weeks,  and  I  will  keep  on 
doing so until something happens. 

After years of inadequate and ineffective voluntary efforts by the 
industry,  we  are  no  closer  to  solving  the  problem  of  indecent  and 
violent  programming  for  children,  despite  the  claims  that  parents 
have  many  tools  at  their  disposal  to  address  unwanted  program-
ming. 

Children  today  are  being  subjected  to  an  unprecedented  level  of 
violent television content. There’s no doubt it is coarsening our cul-
ture, probably debasing our culture. I fear, too, that it is weakening 
our society, as a whole. 

For too long, we have heard promises to do better. They come in 
various forms, in various amounts, to put better tools in the hands

of  parents,  to  provide  more  options  for  families,  but  none  of  this 
has yielded any results; instead, we have the industry blaming par-
ents—interesting—for their lack of oversight of children’s television 
viewing.  I  think  this  is  cowardly.  We  have  a  responsibility  to  do 
better,  all  of  us,  a  responsibility  the  Government  must  take  seri-
ously. 

I  hold  the  entertainment  industry  responsible  for  this.  Decades 
of  scientific  research  have  shown  that  violent  television  and  pro-
gramming  has  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  development  of  chil-
dren,  yet  today  the  content  industry  is  in  a  never-ending  race  to 
the bottom; indeed, one questions whether there is a bottom some-
where, anywhere, these days. 

I’m not sure that all of my colleagues know how violent program-
ming  in  television  has  become,  and,  immediately  following  my 
statement, with the permission of the distinguished Ranking Mem-
ber,  I’m  going  to  show  a  5-minute  video  that  expresses  some  of 
what  I’m  talking  about.  At  my  request,  the  Parents  Television 
Council  has  put  together  this  CD  with  clips  from  broadcast  and 
cable  channels  that  show  shocking,  violent  images.  It  will  not  be 
pretty.  These  images  are  inherently  disturbing  to  adults,  so  imag-
ine what they might be for children. 

Interesting  article  in  he  Washington  Post  this  morning,  I  believe 
it  was,  on  the  effect,  of  the  war,  on  Iraqi  children.  This  is  a  little 
bit different, but, then again, is it? 

I  know  some  of  our  witnesses  will  go  into  far  greater  detail,  but 
let’s  consider  these  facts.  Children  watch  an  average  of  between  2 
and  4  hours  of  television  every  day.  The  occurrence  of  violence  on 
television  has  increased  by  75  percent  since  1998,  and  has  in-
creased  across  the  board  on  all  five  of  the  major  broadcast  net-
works. On average, American youth view more than 1,000 murders, 
rapes,  and  assaults  each  year  on  television.  I  repeat:  On  average, 
American  children  view  more  than  1,000  murders,  rapes,  and  as-
saults each year on television. Sadly, by the time our children leave 
elementary  school,  they  will  have  seen  on  average  100,000  acts  of 
violence on television. 

When I am at home, I meet with West Virginia parents and edu-
cators,  and  they’ve  told  me  that  children’s  behavior  is  becoming 
more  aggressive,  and,  at  times,  crude  or  explicit—they’ve  noticed 
the  change,  and  they’ve  noticed  it  recently—and  that  they  blame 
television  for  much  of  the  problem.  Television  blames  them.  They 
don’t share that view. 

I’ve  met  with  many  representatives  from  the  entertainment  in-
dustry,  representing  broadcasters,  cable,  movies,  and  others.  The 
one thing every CEO never fails to tell me is that they are person-
ally appalled by the violent content on television, and they person-
ally  agree  with  me,  and,  if  they  could  change  it,  they  would.  But 
yet, I never get a reason as to why the industry will not stop show-
ing violent content, which would sort of solve the problem. 

Violent content is cheap to produce. Violent content is profitable. 
Violent  content  sells.  The  entertainment  industry  could  change 
what we watch on television, but it chooses to sell sex and violence 
instead.  I  reject  the  notion  that  television  merely  reflects  our  soci-
ety.  I  reject  that,  whole  cloth.  But,  rather,  I  believe  that  television 
can  and  should  be  a  positive,  so  to  speak,  force.  That  does  not

mean  all  happy,  but  realistic,  fundamentally  constructive,  laying  a 
base. 

To  be  blunt,  the  big  media  companies  have  placed  a  greater  em-
phasis  on  their  corporate  short-term  profits  than  on  long-term 
health  and  well-being  of  our  children.  Instead  of  addressing  the 
problem,  too  much  violent  programming  on  television—that  being 
the  problem—the  industry  seeks  to  hide  behind  ineffective  Band- 
Aids  of  voluntary  action.  I  remember  $250  million  advertising  pro-
grams  about  the  V-Chip,  that  had  a  big  effect  in  West  Virginia,  to 
people that—whose sets had no effective way of control if they were 
bought  before  2000,  which  most  of  them  would  have  been.  They 
said  they  provided  parents  more  tools.  Parents  do  not  want  more 
tools. They want the content off the air. 

It’s  no  big  secret  that  the  industry  has  hoped  that  its  latest  vol-
untary campaign will stave off Congress from establishing common 
sense  content-and-ratings  regulation  for  television.  I  know  that  we 
will  hear  their  now-familiar  arguments  here  today.  The  entertain-
ment industry will claim that voluntary actions are sufficient. They 
always have. I’m sure they will continue to. Or they will blame the 
parents. And they are only giving the public what it wants to view, 
while giving parents all the tools necessary to block unwanted pro-
gramming,  assuming,  of  course,  that  the  parent  is  always  there, 
that  the  two  parents  aren’t  working,  and  all  of  those  other  things 
which  are  casually  tossed  aside.  But  none  of  these  arguments  are 
persuasive enough to convince this Senator to abandon a serious ef-
fort to protect children from unconscionable levels of sex and gratu-
itous  violence  on  what  remains  the  most  pervasive,  inescapable 
means  of  communication  in  America,  which  is  television.  Nothing 
else comes close. 

We  now  know  that  the  entertainment  broadcasting  industry  has 
proven  itself  unable,  and  unwilling,  to  police  itself.  I  fear  that 
graphic,  violent  programming  has  become  so  pervasive,  and  has 
been shown to be so harmful, we are left with no choice but to have 
the  government  step  in.  I  know  that  Congress  has  been  reluctant 
to  take  on  the  issue  of  violence,  because  defining  decency  is  dif-
ficult.  I  will,  again,  reintroduce  my  legislation,  because  we  must 
address this issue. I understand these are hard lines to draw. But, 
just because they’re difficult, doesn’t mean that we should stand by 
and  do  nothing.  We  can  find  these  lines,  and  put  bright  markers 
on them. 

For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we have a moral 
obligation  to  tackle  television  violence  and  arm  our  parents  with 
the tools to make their children safer, but, again, that is easier said 
than done. 

There  are  many,  many  parents  who  are  very  literate,  computer 
and  otherwise,  who  cannot  make  those  things  work.  And,  plus, 
they’re also often not there to check. 

The  real  question  for  all  of  us  today  is,  what  are  we  going  to  do 
about  protecting  our  children  from  the  pervasive  and  escalating 
level  of  television  violence?  Doing  nothing,  to  this  Senator,  is  not 
an option. 

I would call now on the Ranking Member, Senator Stevens.

STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA 

Senator STEVENS. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
As a father of six, and grandfather of 11, more coming, and more 
great-grandchildren  coming  soon,  I  share  your  feelings  about  this. 
But I think we have to tread a lot softer than you indicate we can, 
because  the  constitutional  restraints  that  have  been  imposed  upon 
us  in  the  past  will  certainly  be  brought  upon  us  if  we  go  too  far, 
in  terms  of  trying  to  regulate  this  industry,  which  is  so  vast  and 
so diverse now, it could—you could pull down movies on your com-
puter,  sitting  at  a  desk,  while  your  parents  think  you’re  studying. 
You  can  pull  them  down  on  an  iPod.  There  are  so  many  different 
ways  to  get  to  movies,  other  than  broadcasting  and  cable,  today, 
that  the  whole  question  comes  down,  I  think,  to,  really,  the  movie 
industry  itself,  although,  even  there,  there  are  portions  of  the  in-
dustry  that  are  making  movies  that  are  not  subject  to  the  re-
straints that were self-imposed on the movie industry. I think that 
Jack Valenti, our late friend, started a process of trying to educate 
Americans, and particularly parents, on how they can control what 
their  children  watch  in  their  home.  I  don’t  know  that  even  that’s 
effective  in  trying  to  control  what  they  watch  on  their  iPod  or  on 
their computer, on the various devices that are available today. 

Clearly, the Supreme Court has laid down some guidelines in the 
past, and I fear that, if we go beyond the concept of trying to make 
sure  we  have  a  rating  program  that  works,  and  a  program  that 
works,  as  far  as  giving  parents  every  tool  they  need  to  protect  the 
smaller  children,  by  the  time  they  get  to  the  teens,  they’ve  got  all 
these  devices  today  that  give  them  access  to—actually,  to  broad-
casts  from  outside  of  our  country.  It  is  not  something  that’s  easily 
regulated.  And  the  more  that  we  put  down  too  harsh  rules  on  the 
television  that’s  in  their  home,  the  more  they’re  going  to  acquire 
the  facilities  and  the  capability  and  the  technology  to  watch  what 
they want to watch. 

I  think  there  is  a  little  bit  of  education  involved  here,  as  far  as 
parents are concerned—a lot of it, as a matter of fact. I’ve told you 
the story of my attempt to restrain my children from watching pro-
grams. You’ll recall that. I just didn’t buy the television. 

[Laughter.] 
Senator  STEVENS.  And,  as  you  know,  I—the  mayor  lived  about 
three  houses  down  on  the  block,  and  he  finally  stopped  me  and 
said, ‘‘Stevens, why are your kids—why are your kids always in my 
front room?’’ 
[Laughter.] 
Senator  STEVENS.  He  had  a  television.  Now,  a  simple  matter  is 
that  children  will  go  where  they  want  to  go,  to  watch  what  they 
want to watch, if their parents don’t put them on a leash. Now, as 
a  practical  matter,  what  we’ve  got  to  do  is  be  mindful  of  the  Con-
stitution  and  do  our  best  to  put  down  the  kind  of  regulation  that 
will work. 

I  do  hope  that  we  can  achieve  that.  And  I’m  anxious  to  hear, 
really—I  heard  you  say  that  you  don’t  believe  it  has  accomplished 
anything—I think the program that Jack Valenti started, after our 
three  listening  sessions  in  the  last  Congress,  has  had  some  effect,

5 

and I’m anxious to hear, really, if they have any real good statistics 
on that. 

But I admire you holding the hearing. I hope we can bring about 
some  change,  but  I’m  fearful  of  going  too  far  and  losing  control  al-
together. 

Thank you. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. The Chair, with the permission of his col-
leagues,  would  make  one  observation,  and  that  is  that  the  iPods 
and  all  the  rest  wouldn’t  be  affected,  either,  if  the  content  wasn’t 
made,  in  the  first  place.  You  stop  making  it,  it  doesn’t—you  can’t 
download it, or anything else. 

Second—— 
Senator STEVENS. Now you’re talking about regulating the movie 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Second, I would actually like, now, to put 
on  the  5-minute  video,  which  was  done  to  buttress,  in  a  sense, 
what I’m talking about. And I hope that won’t offend anybody; the 
statements  will  continue  directly  after  that,  but  I’d  like  to  make 
that point while we still have members.

[Video presentation.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. We can stop it there. 
The next speaker will be Senator Lautenberg. 

STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Thanks,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  don’t  mean  to 

cutoff our entertainment. 

The subject is complicated by real life. That’s the problem. When 
you  look  at  the  volume  of  interest  in  The  Sopranos,  it  tells  you 
something  about  human  appetites.  And  where  does  it  start?  It 
starts in the home. 

Mr. Chairman, you said some very interesting things. One of the 
things,  that  sounded  like  it  was  in  passing,  was,  ‘‘The  parents  are 
not  there.’’  That’s  the  bigger  problem,  in  many  ways,  in  my  view. 
Yes,  the  industry  shouldn’t  be  feeding  on  this  prurient  kind  of 
thing.  If  you  go  to  a  theater  today  to  see  a  movie,  invariably,  the 
previews  of  shows  yet  to  come  are  the  most  violent  little  clips 
you’ve  ever  seen.  But  we  tried  regulating  behavior  before.  It  was 
called Prohibition. And it didn’t endure, because the public appetite 
was not there to support it. 

I  agree,  I  have  ten  grandchildren,  I  hate  the  thought  of  them 
watching this kind of, what I will call, ‘‘trash.’’ But to see what in-
terest  there  is.  ask  the  hotel  industry—I  did—when  having  films 
shown on the room TV, and you’ll find out that it’s sex and violence 
in  abundant  numbers,  a  larger  percentage  of  those  than  any  other 
direct subject. 

So,  we’ve  got  to  figure  a  way  through  this  terrible  problem.  It  is 
vulgar.  It  is  discouraging.  And,  when  you  see  something  like  this, 
very frankly, I’ve got to tell you, I turn it off, for me, when it hap-
pens. I just can’t stand the fact of that kind of depravity ruling our 
behavior. 

So, you’re absolutely right, in terms of what we have to do about 
it.  The  thing  that  we  have  to  also  include,  however—and  Senator 
Stevens  mentioned  it—we’ve  got  broadcasts  and  video  games.  I

have  a  friend  who  operates  one  of  the  biggest  bookstore  chains  in 
the  country,  and  he  says  the  biggest  growth  in  their  industry  are 
stores  that  just  deal  with  video  games.  Well,  video  games—I 
haven’t  yet  heard  a  survey  of  what  the  interest  is  in  violent  video 
games, but I know, from seeing kids around, that there is great in-
terest  there.  So,  how  do  you  curb  that  appetite,  as  well  as  asking 
the industry to please, please try to do something that doesn’t vio-
late  our  ability  to  speak  out  on  issues.  But,  somehow  or  other, 
we’ve  got  to  deal  with  a  public  appetite  that  goes  way  beyond  our 
ability  to  control  it  by  behavioral  recommendations  here;  V-Chips, 
all  those  things.  Maybe  the  Government  ought  to  be  sending  out, 
in  a  routine  mailing,  or  some  communications  mechanism,  about 
the fact that you ought not—that, ‘‘Here are ways you, parents, can 
stop  it,  you,  guardians,  can  stop,  some  of  the  violent  things  that 
we’ve seen.’’ 

But, my friends, I’ll close with this. If you see anything more vio-
lent than the war in Iraq, and try to understand why it is that we 
can’t see flag-draped coffins coming in, because we don’t want peo-
ple  to  see  the  violence  that  is  brought  upon  our  society,  there  is 
something terribly hypocritical about the whole thing. And we have 
to approach this in a realistic fashion. 

I thank all of you for being here, and plead for your partnership. 
Let  us  know  what  you  think  we  can  really  do  about  this,  instead 
of  satisfying  the  basic  instinct,  because  if  that’s  what  we’re  going 
to  do  in  our  society,  we’re  going  to  be  a  lot  uglier  than  we  are 
today. 

Thanks, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Sununu? 

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE 

Senator SUNUNU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
I  certainly  concern  a—or  share  a  number  of  the  concerns  that 
you  expressed  in  your  opening  statement,  but  I  don’t  believe  that 
Congress  is  necessarily  reluctant  to  take  on  the  issue.  It  seems  to 
me we spend a great deal of time talking about this very issue, and 
in the last session we spent a great deal of time on the floor of the 
Senate,  and,  I  think,  in  the  House,  trying  to  address,  quote,  ‘‘this 
issue,’’ through legislation. 

I  think  the  difficulty,  however,  is,  as  Senator  Lautenberg  points 
out,  it’s  difficult  and  it’s  complicated.  Anytime  we  try  to  address, 
with quality or form or content of what’s being broadcast or distrib-
uted  by  other  means,  you  run  into  First  Amendment  questions— 
genuine,  important  First  Amendment  questions—that  have  to  be 
dealt with; you run into questions of private carriage, private prop-
erty  rights,  and  what  the  owners  of  certain  networks  have  in  the 
way of rights that need to be protected; and you run into the issue 
of  defining  what  is  meant  by  ‘‘inappropriate,’’  ‘‘indecent,’’  ‘‘illegal.’’ 
And  it’s  very  difficult—as  much  as  we  might  be  bothered  or  dis-
appointed  in  what  we  see  on  different  networks,  or  broadcast 
through different medium, it’s very difficult to solve all those prob-
lems, or address all those concerns, with another rule, another reg-
ulation, or another law.

I  certainly  hope  that  the  panel  we  have  in  front  of  us  might  be 
able  to  provide  some  guidance  or  some  clarity.  There  might  be 
things that we can do more effectively, or the FCC can do more ef-
fectively  to  enforce  existing  legal  and  constitutional  standards,  but 
it’s  a  very  difficult  issue.  And,  as  much  as  I  might  share  many  of 
the  concerns  raised  in  your  opening  statement,  I  can’t,  for  the  life 
of  me,  figure  out  how  it  is  that  showing  what  the  Chairman  be-
lieves to be indecent material on national TV at 10:35 in the morn-
ing  is  going  to  solve  the  problem.  So,  I  hope  we  focus  on  what 
might be done to improve current regulation or enforcement of cur-
rent laws, what might be done to improve those standards in a way 
that’s  consistent  with  the  Constitution  and  consistent  with  private 
property  rights,  and,  at  the  same  time,  I  think,  like  anyone  that 
has  children  or  grandchildren,  you  recognize  how  important  the 
guidance  that  we  give  to  those  children  really  is,  because  there  is 
no  rule,  law,  or  regulation  that  can  strike  from  the  world,  the  air-
waves,  broadcast  medium,  everything  that  we,  as  an  individual, 
feel uncomfortable about, or don’t like, or don’t think really reflects 
the kind of values we want young people to have as they grow up. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
Senator Smith? 

STATEMENT OF HON. GORDON H. SMITH, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON 

Senator SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
This  is  a  very  important  hearing.  There  are  two  principles,  I 
think, that are—we need to bear in mind as we deal with anything 
touching  on  the  First  Amendment,  and  especially  as  it  relates  to 
children. First of all, the Federal Government can be no substitute 
for  good  parenting.  And,  second,  we,  as  parents,  currently  have— 
perhaps  we  need  to  improve  the  types  of  monitoring  devices  that 
we  have  in  order  to  facilitate  good  parenting  so  that  they  can  be 
the monitors of their—of what their children watch. 

Last,  Mr.  Chairman,  a  concern  that  I  have  about  the  whole  a´ la 
carte  approach  is  that  the  current  business  model,  if  it  is  removed 
on  a  a´ la  carte  channel  approach,  is  simply  that  many  of  the  chil-
dren’s  programs,  which  are  not  violent,  which  are  very  good,  are 
dependent  upon,  frankly,  the  success  of  other  channels  that  are 
available.  I  suspect  we  will  lose  a  number  of  children’s  program-
ming  if  we  go  to  an  a´ la  carte  business  model.  That’s  my  concern 
about some of the proposals that are out here. 

So, thank you for the hearing, and I look forward to hearing our 

witnesses. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Klobuchar? 

STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman,  for 
holding  this  important  and  timely  hearing.  And  I  look  forward  to 
talking  about  the  impacts  of  violence  on  children,  as  well  as  how 
we, in Congress, can craft practical and thoughtful solutions. 

As  a  former  prosecutor  and  a  mother  of  a  12-year-old,  I’ve  seen, 
firsthand,  some  of  the  violence  that  our  kids  are  exposed  to,  not

only  on  TV,  but  also,  sadly,  with  some  of  the  cases  that  we  have 
seen  in  their  own  lives  and  in  their  own  neighborhoods.  I’m  fortu-
nate  enough  to  have  a  daughter  who’s  the  ultimate  self-censor.  I 
took  six  12-year-old  girls  to  see  ‘‘Nancy  Drew’’  on  Saturday  night, 
and my daughter spent the entire movie watching it like this. But, 
that  aside,  I  do  think,  as  Senator  Smith  was  saying,  that  parents 
are  our  best  and  first  line,  but  no  technology  or  time  channeling 
system  is  really  going  to  take  place  of  a  parent,  who  is  our  own 
best V-Chip. 

That  being  said,  in  my  role  as  a  prosecutor  I  saw  many  families 
that  didn’t  have  that  situation,  where  a  parent  was  there  all  the 
time,  or  there  would  even  be  families  where  both  parents  were 
doing  everything  they  can,  or  a  single  parent  who’s  doing  every-
thing  they  can,  but  they’re  not  home  in  the  afternoon  when  their 
child gets home from school. And so, that’s why I am interested in 
seeing, and welcome ideas about how Congress, as well as the FCC 
and the entertainment industry, can enact meaningful ways to pro-
tect our kids from violent images. But we need to act thoughtfully, 
in  a  way  that  protects  our  kids,  and  in  a  way  that  we  don’t  just 
put something out there, knowing that it’ll get thrown out in court. 
Commissioner  Copps  stated,  in  his  statement  accompanying  the 
FCC’s  April  2007  report,  he  said,  ‘‘I,  for  one,  proceed  acutely  sen-
sitive  to  the  need  for  a  carefully  crafted  approach.  I  want  to  see  a 
solution that solves the problem without creating others.’’ 

I  think  that’s  what  we  want  to  do  here.  I  think  we  should  con-

sider thoughtful and meaningful ways to protect our kids. 

I  thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from 

the witnesses.

STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY F. WINTER, PRESIDENT, 

PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL 

Mr.  WINTER.  Good  morning,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice  Chairman, 
Senators. Thank you for inviting me to be here with you this morn-
ing. And, Mr. Vice Chairman, it is a special honor for me to be here 
before  this  Committee,  on  whose  staff  I  had  the  pleasure  to  serve 
under your good friend and former colleague Senator Warren Mag-
nuson. 

My name is Tim Winter, and I am President of the Parents Tele-
vision Council. With almost 1.2 million members across the United 
States, the PTC is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, grassroots organization 
dedicated to protecting children and families from graphic sex, vio-
lence, and profanity. Many in the Congress know of the PTC most-

ly  as  a  vocal  advocacy  group,  but  the  lion’s  share  of  our  efforts  go 
into  research  and  education.  The  PTC  monitors  every  hour  of 
prime-time  broadcast  entertainment  programming  and  a  growing 
amount of original cable programming. 

PTC  media  analysts  enter,  into  a  powerful  computer  database, 
every  instance  of  sex,  violence,  profanity,  disrespect  for  authority, 
and  other  program  content  that  parents  might  find  harmful  to 
their  children,  and  we  make  that  information  available,  free  of 
charge, on our website, so that parents and families can make more 
informed media choices. 

So, in the course of our work, Mr. Chairman, we, at the PTC, see 
pretty  much  everything.  And  when  it  comes  to  media  violence,  on 
television  especially,  the  trend  of  what  we’re  seeing  today  is  not 
only concerning, it is frightening. 

This  past  January,  the  PTC  released  this  report,  called  ‘‘Dying 
to  Entertain.’’  It  analyzed  the  volume  and  degree  of  violence  on 
prime-time  television.  The  television  season  which  just  concluded 
last  year  was  the  most  violent  that  PTC  ever  recorded,  averaging 
4.41  instances  of  violence  per  hour  during  prime  time,  or  one  in-
stance every 13 and a half minutes, an increase of 75 percent since 
the  1998  television  season.  Over  the  course  of  a  year,  that  means 
thousands  of  violent  depictions  are  broadcast  over  the  public  air-
waves when millions of children are in the audience. 

In addition to the marked increase in the quantity of violence, we 

are seeing several other very disturbing trends: 

First, the depictions of violence have become far more graphic, as 
we saw, far more realistic than ever before, thanks, in part, to en-
hanced  computer  graphics  and  special  effects  employed  in  tele-
vision production today. 

Second,  there  is  an  alarming  trend  for  violent  scenes  to  include 
a  sexual  element.  Rapists,  sexual  predators,  and  fetishists  appear 
with increasing frequency on the prime-time programs. 

Third,  we  are  now  seeing  the  protagonist,  the  person  the  audi-
ence  is  supposed  to  identify  with,  as  the  perpetrator  of  the  violent 
acts. 

And  we  are  also  seeing  more  children  being  depicted  as  the  vic-

tims of violence. 

As  you  know,  we  prepared  the  DVD  with  the  scene  sampling. 
The  scene  where  we  saw  the  sniffing  of  the  drugs  off  the  sliced- 
open intestines, aired this last May 22nd, is called ‘‘NCIS,’’ on CBS. 
And  this  aired  at  8  p.m.,  7  p.m.  Central.  And,  Senator,  that  show 
did  not  have  a  ‘‘V’’  violence  descriptor,  so  the  V-Chip  would  not 
have worked, if a parent had attempted to set it. 

On an episode of ‘‘CSI’’ that we did not see, which normally airs 
at  9  o’clock  Eastern,  but  often  is  repeated  earlier  in  the  evening, 
there was a scene on that tape where a woman, who had been hav-
ing  sex  with  her  son  for  many  years,  and  then  her  son  became  a 
psychotic  serial  rapist  and  was  institutionalized,  the  mother  took 
a  job  as  a  nurse  at  the  institution  so  that  she  could  continue  to 
have sex with him. When she learned that her son was having sex 
with one of the male inmates, she killed the man, then had her son 
cover up the crime by bashing the dead man’s head into the ground 
until  it  became  a  bloody,  unrecognizable  mess.  Along  comes  an-

other  inmate,  rubs  his  hands  in  the  blood,  and  then  hungrily 
smears it over his face as if he wants to devour it. 

The  scene  where  we  saw  the  forced  oral  rape,  the  man  per-
forming that oral rape was a police officer. The show is called ‘‘The 
Shield,’’ which began on expanded basic cable, and now airs in syn-
dication  on  broadcast  television.  The  Shield  regularly  features 
some  of  the  most  graphic  violence,  and,  in  particular,  sexually 
graphic violence. 

The  creator  of  another  series  on  that  same  network,  FX,  Ryan 
Murphy,  publicly  stated  that  it  might  be  his  legacy  to  make  pos-
sible a rear-entry sex scene on broadcast television. And, Senators, 
if you subscribe to a cable to satellite service, you are forced to pay 
almost  $9  a  year  to  the  FX  network  so  they  can  produce  and  air 
that kind of content. 

Eighty  million  Americans  are  also  forced  into  that  bundling 
scheme. And, as FCC Chairman Martin rightfully pointed out, that 
if  a  family  must  continue  to  pay  for  entertainment  programming 
even  when  they  object  to  it,  there  is  little  or  no  incentive  for  the 
programmers to change. 

As troubling as these content examples are, Senator, I am equal-
ly  dismayed  by  the  seeming  contempt  the  industry  has  for  anyone 
who would suggest reasonable restraint. Recently, the CEO of Time 
Warner  decried  this  hearing,  likening  it  to  Nazi  Germany.  Every 
time  the  public  and  our  public  servants  call  for  more  responsible 
behavior,  the  industry  refuses  to  have  a  meaningful  dialogue  or 
offer  real  solutions.  Rather  than  working  with  you  to  address  the 
negative  impact  the  products  have  on  children,  they  turn  the  con-
versation  into  a  lecture  on  broadcast  standards  and  the  Constitu-
tion. Rather than acknowledging the scientific evidence manifested 
in  over  1,000  medical  and  clinical  studies,  they  underwrite  their 
own  research  and  then  point  to  its  lone  and  differing  conclusion. 
And,  rather  than  focusing  on  their  statutory  public-interest  re-
quirements  for  using  the  public  airwaves,  they  shift  the  conversa-
tion  to  entertainment  in  general,  and  invoke  the  always  sobering 
term, ‘‘chilling effect.’’ 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Winter, I don’t want to interrupt you, 
but  I  failed  to  explain,  at  the  beginning,  that  there  is  a  5-minute 
rule  for  testimony,  so  that  what  you  have  to  do  is  keep  your  eye 
on  that  little  machine  at  the  center  to  see  which  color  it  is.  I  see 
red. So, if you could finish in one sentence, it would be good. 

Mr. WINTER. In one sentence? 
In closing, Senator— 
[Laughter.] 
Mr. WINTER.—if I may offer a quote, sir—‘‘Today, we are needing 
to be as responsible as we can possibly be, not just thinking of our 
own  children,  but  our  friends’  and  neighbors’  children.’’  This  was 
spoken  by  Steven  Spielberg.  He  understands  the  difference  be-
tween the type of violence we’re seeing here today, Senator, and en-
tertainment  where  violence  has  been  part  of  it  for  thousands  of 
years, as part of storytelling. 

I  thank  you.  I’ll  look  forward  to  working  with  you,  Senator,  to 

find meaningful solutions here today. 

[The prepared statement of Mr. Winter follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY F. WINTER, PRESIDENT, 

PARENTS TELEVISION COUNCIL 

Good day Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman and Senators. Thank you for inviting 
me  to  be  here  with  you  this  morning  to  discuss  this  important  subject.  And  may 
I  begin  Mr.  Chairman  and  Mr.  Vice  Chairman,  by  saying  what  a  personal  honor  it 
is  for  me  to  appear  before  this  Committee,  on  whose  staff  I  had  the  pleasure  to 
serve under your good friend and former colleague, Warren Magnuson. 

My  name  is  Tim  Winter  and  I  am  President  of  the  Parents  Television  Council. 
With  almost  1.2  million  members  across  the  United  States,  the  PTC  is  a  non-par-
tisan,  non-profit,  grassroots  organization  dedicated  to  protecting  children  and  fami-
lies from graphic sex, violence and profanity in entertainment. 

Many  in  the  Congress  know  of  the  PTC  mostly  as  a  vocal  advocacy  group,  but 
the  lion’  share  of  our  effort  goes  into  research  and  education.  The  PTC  staff  mon-
itors every hour of primetime broadcast entertainment programming and a growing 
amount  of  original  programming  on  basic  cable.  PTC  media  analysts  enter  into  a 
powerful computer database every instance of sex, violence, profanity, disrespect for 
authority, and other program content that parents might find harmful to their chil-
dren; and we make that information available free of charge on our website so that 
parents and families can make more informed media choices. 

So  in  the  course  of  our  work,  Mr.  Chairman,  we  at  the  PTC  see  pretty  much  ev-
erything. And when it comes to violence on television, the trend of what we are see-
ing today is not only concerning, it is frightening. In fact none of us would even be 
here  today  but  for  a  level  of  media  violence  that  approaches  epidemic  proportions. 
This past January the PTC released Dying to Entertain—our latest Special Report 
analyzing the volume and degree of violence on primetime television. The television 
season  which  concluded  last  year  was  the  most  violent  that  the  PTC  has  ever  re-
corded—averaging 4.41 instances of violence per hour during prime time, or one in-
stance every 131⁄2 minutes—an increase of 75 percent since the 1998 television sea-
son. Over the course of a year, that means many thousands of violent depictions are 
broadcast over the public airwaves at times when millions of children are in the au-
dience. 

Between  1998  and  2006,  violence  increased  in  every  time  slot,  including  the  so- 
called  Family  Hour  of  8  p.m.  Eastern,  7  p.m.  Central  Time.  Last  year  nearly  half 
(49  percent)  of  all  episodes  which  aired  during  the  study  period  contained  at  least 
one  instance  of  violence.  56  percent  was  person-on-person  violence.  And  54  percent 
of violent scenes contained either a depiction of death or an implied death. 

In addition to the marked increase in the quantity of violence, we are seeing sev-
eral  other  disturbing  trends.  First,  the  depictions  of  violence  have  become  far  more 
graphic  and  more  realistic  than  ever  before,  thanks  in  part  to  enhanced  computer 
graphics  and  special  effects  employed  in  television  production  today.  Second,  there 
is an alarming trend for violent scenes to include a sexual element. Rapists, sexual 
predators  and  fetishists  appear  with  increasing  frequency  on  prime  time  programs. 
Third,  we  are  now  seeing  the  protagonist—the  person  the  audience  is  supposed  to 
identify  with—as  the  perpetrator  of  the  most  violent  acts.  And  lastly  we  are  seeing 
more children being depicted as the victims of violence. 

Mr. Chairman, violence has played an important role in dramatic story-telling for 
thousands  of  years.  But  the  state  of  television  violence  is  nothing  like  it  has  ever 
been before. As former FCC Chairman Newt Minow recently noted, ‘‘forty years ago 
I said television was a vast wasteland; now it is a toxic dump.’’ 

Even TV critics who generally praise shows that ‘‘push the envelope’’ were aghast 
at  how  grisly  the  TV  networks’  2005–2006  season  offerings  were.  The  Washington 
Post  suggested  that  the  season  was  ‘‘dominated  by  a  new  brood  of  a  relatively  new 
breed:  shows  that  are  horrific  on  purpose,  with  gore  as  graphic  and  grisly  as  in 
many a monstrous movie.’’ Rolling Stone said ‘‘Welcome to prime-time-network and 
basic-cable  television,  where  a  bumper  crop  of  bloodthirsty  police  procedurals  and 
high-concept  thrillers  is  making  for  perhaps  the  most  violent,  sadistic  TV  season 
ever.’’  The  Associated  Press  said,  ‘‘The  body  count  in  prime-time  television  these 
days  rivals  that  of  a  war  zone  . . .  [making]  network  TV  home  to  an  astonishing 
amount of blood ‘n’ guts.’’ 

We  as  a  nation  have  been  talking  about  the  problem  of  TV  violence  for  a  long 
time, and the industry has been providing excuses for the same duration. The House 
of  Representatives  held  hearings  more  than  50  years  ago  to  explore  the  impact  of 
television violence and concluded that the ‘‘television broadcast industry was a per-
petrator  and  deliverer  of  violence.’’  In  1972  the  Surgeon  General’s  office  conducted 
an  overview  of  existing  studies  on  television  violence  and  concluded  that  it  was  a 
‘‘contributing factor to increases in violent crime and antisocial behavior.’’ That was

12 

in  1972.  As  I  will  now  illustrate,  the  manner  in  which  violence  is  depicted  today 
has changed drastically since 1972. 

We  have  prepared  for  your  staff  members  a  DVD  with  a  sampling  of  scenes  con-
taining violence from recent television programs. Let me describe to you a few high-
lights or, more appropriately, a few low-lights: 

During  the  May  22nd  episode  of  NCIS  that  aired  during  the  so-called  ‘‘family 
hour’’ of 8 p.m. Eastern time (7 p.m. CT/MT), a drug smuggler dies when the pack-
ets in his stomach containing the drugs release deadly amounts into his system. The 
drug dealer, who was waiting for the delivery, and the smuggler’s sister, a desperate 
junkie,  go  to  the  hospital  and  attempt  to  retrieve  the  drugs  from  the  smuggler’s 
body. 

The  scene  shows  the  dead  smuggler  having  his  midsection  sliced  open  and  his 
blood-soaked  organs  pulled  out  of  his  body.  The  man’s  digestive  tract  is  sliced  open 
and white powder spills over his bloodied torso. When a fight ensues, one character 
stabs  the  drug  dealer  with  a  scalpel  and  another  character  shoots  the  drug  dealer. 
Then  the  junkie-sister  is  shown  with  her  face  buried  in  her  brother’s  bloody  intes-
tines  as  she  snorts  heroin  off  his  dead  body.  This  episode  was  rated  TV–14,  with 
no V content descriptor indicating violence. 

On an episode of C.S.I.—which normally airs at 9 p.m. (8 p.m. Central and Moun-
tain times) and is often repeated at 8 p.m. ET/PT—a young man is murdered inside 
a mental institution. Investigators discover that the killer was one of the nurses in 
the  mental  ward  and  mother  to  one  of  the  inmates.  It  turns  out  that  the  woman 
had been having sex with her son for many years. The boy became a psychotic serial 
rapist  and  was  institutionalized.  The  woman  continued  to  send  her  son  love  letters 
while he was institutionalized and eventually took a job as a nurse at the institution 
so  that  she  could  continue  to  have  sex  with  him.  When  she  learned  that  her  son 
was  having  sex  with  one  of  the  male  inmates,  she  killed  her  rival  by  smothering 
him with a pillow, then had her son cover up her crime by bashing the dead man’s 
head into the ground until it became a bloody, unrecognizable mess. Another inmate 
comes  along,  rubs  his  hands  in  the  blood,  and  hungrily  smears  it  all  over  his  face 
as  if  he  wants  to  devour  it.  The  episode  actually  began  with  this  horrific  scene  of 
brutality and gore—so any parent watching TV with their children who wasn’t fast 
enough changing the channel, would have been subjected to this disturbing content. 
Because  this  program  airs  before  10  p.m.,  as  many  as  2  million  children  are  in  the 
viewing audience on any given week, according to Nielsen. 

A  program  called  The  Shield  began  on  the  advertiser-supported,  expanded-basic 
cable  network  FX,  and  now  the  program  airs  on  broadcast  stations  nationwide  in 
syndication.  This  program  has  featured  some  of  the  most  graphic  violence  and—in 
particular—graphic sexual violence ever seen on television—including premium sub-
scription  networks  like  HBO.  In  one  episode,  Vic  Mackey—the  series’  anti-hero,  a 
corrupt cop—becomes enraged when he learns that Armadillo, a Mexican gang lead-
er, burned one of his informants to death by ‘‘necklacing’’ him—placing tires around 
him  so  that  he  is  immobilized,  then  dousing  him  with  gasoline  and  setting  him  on 
fire.  Vic  brutally  beats  Armadillo,  repeatedly  kicking  him  and  hitting  him  in  the 
face with a heavy book as blood spatters on Vic’s shirt and face. Vic drags Armadillo 
into the kitchen and turns on an electric stove burner, then pushes Armadillo’s face 
into the red-hot coils of the burner. He pulls Armadillo’s head back so that TV audi-
ence can see the melting and charred flesh on his face. When Vic’s men finally pull 
him off, Armadillo’s mouth is filled with blood, and Vic’s face is covered with Arma-
dillo’s blood. 

In another episode of The Shield, Police Captain David Aceveda is forced at gun-
point  to  perform  oral  sex  on  a  gang  member.  While  holding  the  barrel  of  a  gun  to 
the  policeman’s  mouth,  the  gang  member  asks  him,  ‘‘You  ever  suck  a  dick  like  a 
cell bitch, cop man? Huh?’’ He threatens to kill the officer if he doesn’t perform fel-
latio, and the officer is seen and heard gagging and whimpering in humiliation. The 
gang  member  then  gets  one  of  his  friends  to  take  a  picture  of  the  scene  as  he  cli-
maxes into the policeman’s mouth. In the following season, Captain Aceveda repeat-
edly acted out violent rape fantasies with a prostitute. 

These  basic  cable  examples  appeared  on  the  FX  basic  cable  network.  Ryan  Mur-
phy,  the  creator  of  another  FX  series,  Nip/Tuck,  publicly  stated  that  it  might  be 
his legacy to make possible a rear-entry sex scene on broadcast television. And Sen-
ators,  if  you  subscribe  to  a  cable  or  satellite  service,  you  are  forced  to  pay  almost 
$9.00  every  year  to  the  FX  network  so  they  can  produce  and  air  this  kind  of  mate-
rial.  And  with  tens  of  millions  of  Americans  forced  into  the  industry’s  bundling 
scheme, FX reaps hundreds of millions of dollars each year to produce this material, 
and  that  is  before  they  sell  even  one  TV  commercial.  FCC  Chairman  Martin  has 
rightfully  pointed  out  that  ‘‘if  a  family  must  continue  to  pay  for  programming  even 
when  they  object  to  it,  there  is  little  or  no  incentive  for  programmers  to  respond.’’

This  Committee  has  heard  personally  from  cable  distributors  who  would  like  to 
provide  their  customers  with  an  opportunity  to  pick  and  choose—and  pay  for—only 
the networks they want. But they can’t. As DISH Network CEO Charlie Ergen, and 
American Cable Association President Matt Polka have told you, the cable network 
media conglomerates won’t allow it. So we must ask: are the cable industry’s Wash-
ington insiders looking out for consumers and families, or are they protecting a busi-
ness  model  that  not  only  forces  unwanted  content  into  tens  of  millions  of  homes, 
but also makes them pay for it? 

As  troubling  as  those  content  examples  are,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  equally  dis-
gusted by the seeming contempt the industry has for anyone who would suggest rea-
sonable  self-restraint.  Last  month  the  CEO  of  Time  Warner  hypocritically  warned 
parents:  ‘‘visit  the  Holocaust  museum  in  Washington  and  you’ll  see  what  happens 
when  government  gets  control  of  the  message.’’  Yet  no  one  is  arguing  that  govern-
ment  should  do  any  such  thing.  Are  we  to  believe  that  the  entertainment  industry 
views  the  overwhelming  concern  of  millions  of  parents  and  families  with  that  level 
of  disdain?  If  so,  how  can  we  believe  anything  they  say  about  wanting  to  help  par-
ents protect children? 

Every time the public—and our public servants—call for more responsible behav-
ior,  the  industry  refuses  to  have  a  meaningful  dialog  or  offer  real  solutions.  Rather 
than coming before you to address the negative impact their products have on chil-
dren,  they  turn  the  conversation  into  a  Constitutional  lecture  and  hire  a  legendary 
scholar to speak for them. Rather than acknowledging the scientific evidence mani-
fested  in  over  a  thousand  medical  and  clinical  studies,  they  underwrite  their  own 
research and point to its differing, but uncorroborated, conclusion. And rather than 
focusing  on  their  statutory  public  interest  requirements  for  using  the  public  air-
waves,  they  shift  the  conversation  to  entertainment  in  general  and  invoke  the  al-
ways-sobering term, ‘‘chilling effect.’’ Many TV executives have used this term pub-
licly  to  denounce  the  FCC’s  Janet  Jackson  ruling  and  the  impact  it’s  had  on  their 
business. But I wonder how ‘‘chilling’’ things really are if, as we’ve read in TV indus-
try trade papers, the Fox broadcast network will be airing a program this fall where 
an amorous monkey joins a man and woman in a sexual encounter. 

But  I  suppose  the  industry’s  behavior  should  come  as  no  surprise.  Look  at  their 
track  record.  After  the  Janet  Jackson  incident,  television  executives  were  quick  to 
come  before  the  Congress  to  pledge  zero-tolerance  for  indecency.  Shortly  thereafter 
they filed a Federal lawsuit which would allow them to use the F-word at any time 
of  the  day,  even  in  front  of  millions  of  children.  And  sadly  they  managed  to  find 
two  judges  in  New  York  City  who  agreed  to  that  preposterous  abuse  of  the  public 
airwaves. 

In  a  slap  in  the  face  to  the  Congress  and  to  millions  of  outraged  families,  CBS 
will be arguing in front of the Third Circuit in September that the Super Bowl strip-
tease  was  not  indecent.  To  add  insult  to  injury,  a  few  years  ago  CBS’  parent  com-
pany  signed  a  Consent  Decree  with  the  FCC  admitting  to  violating  broadcast  de-
cency  law,  agreeing  to  pay  a  fine  and  submitting  to  a  detailed  compliance  plan  to 
insure that indecent material would not meet its air during the times when children 
are  most  likely  to  be  in  the  audience.  To  this  day,  there  is  no  hint  that  CBS  has 
implemented the terms of this Consent Decree. 

Through efforts like the ‘‘TV Boss’’ campaign, the industry promised you hundreds 
of millions of dollars to educate parents on content-blocking technologies, yet all ob-
jective data shows that parents still have no constructive grasp over the TV ratings 
system or the technologies that are reliant upon them. 

And  speaking  of  the  rating  system,  let’s  talk  about  parental  controls  for  a  mo-
ment. When the V-Chip was introduced the television industry denounced it as cen-
sorial heresy. That is, they denounced it until they found a way to manipulate what 
was supposed to be a simple and transparent prophylactic device. Instead the indus-
try  turned  the  V-Chip  into  a  means  for  even  more  graphic  content  while  using  it 
as an excuse to violate the broadcast decency law. 

Our research into the television ratings system has repeatedly concluded that the 
industry’s  application  of  it  is  arbitrary,  inconsistent,  capricious  and  self-serving.  In 
a  study  we  released  this  past  April,  content  ratings  descriptors  were  either  inac-
curate  or  missing  two-thirds  of  the  time.  During  the  study  period,  not  one  single 
program  on  primetime  broadcast  television  was  rated  TV–MA,  meaning  that  the 
networks felt all of their content was appropriate for children as young as 14. 

Mr.  Chairman,  please  understand  that  this  is  an  industry  that  I  love  with  every 
fiber  of  my  being.  I  spent  most  of  my  career—more  than  20  years—working  in  the 
media  industry,  the  majority  of  which  was  in  broadcasting  and  cable  television.  It 
is  a  wonderful  business,  capable  of  producing  not  only  enlightening,  educating  and 
entertaining  programming,  but  it  is  also  a  lucrative  business  with  profit  margins 
that  most  industries  can  only  dream  of.  But  with  the  ability  to  deliver  a  product

directly  into  every  home  in  America  comes  a  duty  to  serve  the  public  interest.  As 
Commissioner Copps stated in this very room, the term ‘‘public interest’’ appears no 
less  than  112  times  in  the  original  law  that  addresses  the  use  of  the  public  air-
waves.  But  by  my  count,  the  terms  ‘‘Nielsen  Ratings’’  or  ‘‘advertiser  cost  per  thou-
sand’’ or ‘‘earnings per share’’ never once appeared. I have publicly stated a number 
of  times  that  ‘‘public  interest’’  and  ‘‘corporate  interest’’  are  not  mutually  exclusive. 
Sometimes the two do not see eye-to-eye, and when they don’t, it is the public inter-
est which must prevail. I ask you, Mr. Chairman, when does hurting children serve 
the public interest? 

Nobody  on  Capitol  Hill  needs  help  from  me  in  reading  data  from  a  national  poll, 
but last week we all received information that needs to be carefully considered here 
today.  The  highly  respected  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  released  data  proving  just 
how concerned parents are about this matter. Even though the vast majority of par-
ents  say  they  are  closely  monitoring  the  media  behavior  of  their  children,  parents 
are so concerned about the harmful content that still reaches their kids that 66 per-
cent  favor  new  regulation  to  limit  the  amount  of  sex  and  violence  during  the  early 
evening  hours.  Let  me  say  that  again:  two-thirds  of  parents  favor  new  regulation. 
Clearly the status quo is not working. 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  entertainment  industry  could  help  if  it  wanted  to,  but  it 
doesn’t  want  to.  Producers  should  step  back  and  reconsider  their  seeming  urge  for 
‘‘one-upsmanship’’  in  their  depictions  of  ever-more-graphic  violent  content.  Broad-
casters could air graphic material later at night, when children are in bed. And the 
cable  industry  could  allow  its  customers  to  select  and  pay  for  the  cable  networks 
they want to purchase. 

The industry knows graphic and indecent material is inappropriate for certain au-
diences and at certain times. They embrace rules to prevent words and actions from 
being used in their workplace which could be sexually harassing. In fact the content 
samples  above  could  constitute  grounds  for  dismissal  of  a  network  employee  if  he/ 
she acted in such a way to a coworker. And the industry regularly incorporates into 
employment  agreements  what  is  called  a  Morals  Clause,  allowing  them  to  fire  an 
employee  or  an  artist  for  broadly-defined  behavior.  Yet  they  somehow  justify  deliv-
ering material like I’ve just described into living rooms around the country. 

When it comes to behaving responsibly, sadly the industry is the model of inertia. 
Only  when  forced  by  the  public  through  you  is  there  every  any  positive  movement 
undertaken by the industry. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  know  in  my  heart  that  the  industry  is  capable  of  solving  this 
issue if they truly wanted to. The people I worked with during my twenty-plus years 
in  the  industry  are  brilliant  and  creative.  In  fact  the  industry  did  implement  solu-
tions  for  decades  in  the  past.  But  the  question  is:  will  they  help  to  solve  this  issue 
today?  If  the  National  Rifle  Association  can  help  the  Congress  pass  consensus  gun 
control  legislation,  then  I  believe  Hollywood  can  help  the  Congress  deal  with  this 
issue. Moreover, it must. 

Representing  more  than  a  million  concerned  families,  we  stand  ready  to  work 
with  you  to  forge  real  solutions  to  these  problems.  I  hope  the  industry  will  step  up 
and join us. 

Thank you. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Winter.

STATEMENT OF PETER LIGUORI, PRESIDENT, 

ENTERTAINMENT, FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY 

Mr.  LIGUORI.  Thank  you,  Senator  Rockefeller,  Co-Chairman  Ste-
vens,  members  of  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee.  I  appreciate 
the opportunity to appear before you today. I ask that my full writ-
ten testimony and attachments be submitted for the record. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Will be done. 
Mr. LIGUORI. I approach this issue from a professional, personal, 
and  civic  perspective.  Professionally,  as  President  of  the  FOX 
Broadcasting  Company,  I’m  charged  with  putting  on  the  air  a  di-
verse slate of entertainment programming. Personally, as a parent, 
I  ensure  that  the  shows  watched  by  my  13-year-old  daughter, 
Susannah,  and  my  15-year-old  son,  Jackson,  are  appropriate  for

their  age  and  maturity  level.  Finally,  as  a  citizen,  I’m  deeply  con-
cerned  about  the  problem  of  violence  in  our  society.  At  the  same 
time,  I’m  committed  to  the  First  Amendment  right  to  free  speech. 
We,  at  FOX,  take  seriously  our  responsibility  to  inform  viewers 
about our content. We have a large department of broadcast stand-
ards professionals whose job it is, is to ensure that our shows com-
ply with the law and our own internal stringent standards. The de-
partment is involved at every step in the development, production, 
and  broadcast  of  our  entertainment  programming.  They  meticu-
lously  review  more  than  500  hours  of  programming  and  tens  of 
thousands  of  commercials  per  year.  They’re  responsible  for  rating 
each episode of each show, providing both an age-based rating and 
content  descriptors,  where  necessary.  These  ratings  are  shown  at 
the  start  of  every  program  on  our  air  and  after  each  commercial 
break.  When  appropriate,  we  also  place  an  additional  full-screen 
advisory  at  the  start  of  the  program  to  provide  a  warning  to  par-
ents  to  pay  close  attention  before  they  allow  their  kids  to  tune  in. 
On the poster in front of you, we have a visual depiction of what 
the ratings bug and advisories look like for ‘‘24.’’ Note that the ad-
visory  is  also  provided  through  a  voice-over—in  this  case,  by  the 
star of ‘‘24,’’ Keifer Sutherland. 

We also air public-service announcements as part of an industry-
wide  media  campaign,  spearheaded  by  the  late  Jack  Valenti,  that 
urges parents to take charge of their children’s TV viewing. 

Again, the posters in front of you are pictures of one of the PSAs 
and  a  print  ad.  The  PSAs  run  during  prime  time  in  some  of  our 
most  popular  shows,  including  ‘‘American  Idol.’’  This  PSA  cam-
paign  refers  parents  to  a  website,  thetvboss.org,  where  we  provide 
detailed information about parental controls and the TV rating sys-
tem. 

We take all these steps to help parents make informed decisions. 
As  we  speak,  the  industry  is  looking  at  ways  to  improve  the  con-
sistency of the TV rating system. Monthly, we, at FOX, review our 
standards and practices to ensure that we are adjusting to an ever- 
changing media environment. 

Beyond our civic duty, we do this because it’s good business. Our 
goal is twofold: to draw viewers by providing shows that they want 
to see, and to keep them by giving them programming they expect 
to  see.  It  does  us  no  good  to  surprise  parents  with  inappropriate 
content,  because  such  surprises  could  negatively  impact  future 
FOX viewing. 

Teamed with our efforts, parents have a host of technological and 
informational  tools  at  their  disposal,  including  the  V-Chip,  cable 
and  satellite  parental  controls,  and  third-party  rating  tools.  And, 
above  all,  let’s  not  forget  the  most  effective  and  widely  used  tool 
of  all:  parents’  individual  discretion.  A  TV  Watch  study  released 
yesterday  found  that  73  percent  of  all  parents  monitor  what  their 
children  watch.  This  number  goes  up  to  87  percent  for  those  par-
ents  who  have  children  under  the  age  of  11.  As  we  will  hear  from 
Professor  Tribe,  given  the  inherent  difficulty  of  defining  violence 
and drawing lines about what is appropriate, any attempt to regu-
late  the  depiction  of  violence  could  be  found  unconstitutional,  and 
it would have a profound chilling effect on the creative community’s

ability to produce authentic programming reflective of the world we 
live in. 

Let me be clear, I share your concern about violence in our soci-
ety.  But  there  isn’t  an  easy  solution.  The  studies  on  the  relation-
ship  between  TV  violence  and  violence  in  young  people  are  clear. 
Three  reports  produced  by  our  Government—namely,  the  Surgeon 
General,  the  FTC,  and  the  FCC—have  concluded  there  may  be  a 
connection  between  television  and  violence,  but  no  causal  link  has 
been established. This distinction is critically important. Without a 
causal link, we cannot justify imposing content limits on our media. 
Should we, as parents, do more, nonetheless, to minimize our kids’ 
exposure to TV violence? Absolutely. But this is the job of parents, 
not of the Government. 

In  closing,  parents  have  the  information,  the  tools,  and,  above 
all, the responsibility to decide which television shows are right for 
themselves  and  their  children.  We  believe  we  should  keep  it  that 
way. 

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PETER LIGUORI, PRESIDENT, ENTERTAINMENT, 

FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY 

Chairman Inouye, Co-Chairman Stevens, Members of the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  you  today  to  talk  about  the

speech. 

We  at  Fox  take  seriously  our  responsibility  to  inform  viewers  about  our  content. 
We  have  a  large  department  of  Broadcast  Standards  professionals  whose  job  it  is 
to ensure that our shows comply with the law and our own stringent internal stand-
ards.  These  Standards  professionals  are  involved  at  every  step  in  the  development, 
production and broadcast of our entertainment programming. They meticulously re-
view  more  than  500  hours  of  programming  and  tens  of  thousands  of  commercials 
a  year.  They  are  also  responsible  for  rating  each  episode  of  every  show,  providing 
both an age-based rating (such as TV–PG or TV–14) and content descriptors where 
necessary (‘‘S’’ for sexual content, ‘‘L’’ for language, or ‘‘V’’ for violence). 

These ratings are shown at the start of every program on our air, and after each 
commercial  break.  When  appropriate,  we  also  place  an  additional,  full  screen  advi-
sory at the start of the program to provide a warning to parents to pay close atten-
tion before they allow their kids to tune in. On the poster in the front of the hearing 
room,  we  have  a  visual  depiction  of  what  the  ratings  bug  and  advisories  look  like 
for Fox’s 24. Note that the advisory is also provided through a voiceover, in this case 
by the star of 24, Kiefer Sutherland. 

We also air public service announcements as part of an industrywide media cam-

Beyond  our  civic  duty,  we  do  this  because  it’s  good  business.  Our  goal  is  twofold: 
to draw viewers by providing shows they want to see and keep them by giving them 
programming  they  expect  to  see.  It  does  us  no  good  to  surprise  parents  with  inap-
propriate content because such surprises could impact future Fox viewing. 

Teamed with our efforts, parents have a host of technical and informational tools 
at  their  disposal,  including  the  V-Chip,  cable  and  satellite  parental  controls  and 
third-party rating tools. And, above all, let’s not forget the most effective and wide-
ly-used tool: parents’ individual discretion. (See Attachment 1.) 

The Kaiser Family Foundation last week released a survey which found that two- 
thirds  of  parents  monitor  their  children’s  media  use.  Clearly,  monitoring  is  as  nat-
ural and simple as other daily parental tasks such as telling kids to look both ways 
before  crossing  the  street,  encouraging  them  to  wear  sunscreen,  or  telling  them  to 
eat their vegetables. 

Given  the  inherent  difficulty  of  defining  violence  and  drawing  lines  about  what 
is  appropriate,  any  attempt  to  regulate  the  depiction  of  violence  seemingly  would 
be  found  unconstitutional.  And  it  would  have  a  profound  chilling  effect  on  the  cre-
ative  community’s  ability  to  produce  authentic  programming  reflective  of  the  world 
we live in. 

Let me be clear: I share your concern about violence in our society. But there isn’t 
an  easy  solution.  The  studies  on  the  relationship  between  TV  violence  and  violence 
in young people are clear. Three reports produced by our government—the Surgeon 
General,  the  FTC,  and  the  FCC—have  concluded  that,  while  there  may  be  a  CON-
NECTION  between  television  and  violence,  there  is  no  CAUSAL  link.  This  distinc-
tion  is  critically  important.  Without  a  causal  link,  we  cannot  justify  imposing  con-
tent limits on the media. (See Attachments 2 and 3.) 

Should  we  as  parents,  nonetheless,  do  our  jobs  to  minimize  our  kids’  exposure  to 
violent  television?  ABSOLUTELY.  But  this  is  the  job  of  parents,  not  the  govern-
ment. 

In  closing,  parents  have  the  information,  the  tools  and,  above  all,  the  responsi-
bility  to  decide  which  television  shows  are  right  for  themselves  and  their  children. 
We believe we should keep it that way. (See Attachment 4.)

STATEMENT OF DALE KUNKEL, PH.D., PROFESSOR, 

DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNICATION, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA 

Dr. KUNKEL. Good morning. 
I’ve studied children and media issues for over 20 years, and I’m 
one of several researchers who led the National Television Violence 
Study,  a  project  widely  recognized  as  one  of  the  largest  scientific 
studies  of  media  violence.  In  my  remarks  here  today,  I’m  going  to 
briefly  report  some  key  findings  from  that  project,  and  also  try  to 
summarize  the  state  of  knowledge  in  the  scientific  community 
about the effects of media violence on children. 

You all know concern about the effects of harmful violence on tel-
evision dates back to the 1950s, and the legitimacy of that concern 
has  been  corroborated  by  extensive  scientific  research  that’s  accu-
mulated  over  the  past  40  years.  Indeed,  in  reviewing  the  totality 
of  empirical  evidence  regarding  the  impact  of  media  violence,  the

conclusion that exposure to violent portrayals poses a risk of harm-
ful psychological effects on children has been reached by the United 
States  Surgeon  General,  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health, 
the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  American  Medical  Associa-
tion,  the  American  Psychological  Association,  the  American  Acad-
emy  of  Pediatrics,  and  a  host  of  other  scientific  and  public  health 
agencies and organizations. 

These harmful effects are grouped into three primary categories. 
First,  and  most  importantly,  children  learn  aggressive  attitudes 
and behaviors from watching TV violence. Second, they become de-
sensitized,  or  have  an  increased  callousness  toward  victims  of  vio-
lence  in  society.  And,  third,  they  also  develop  an  exaggerated  fear 
of being victimized by violence. 

While  all  of  these  effects  are  adverse  outcomes,  it  is  the  first— 
an increased propensity for violence later in life—that is at the core 
of  public  health  concern  about  children’s  exposure  to  televised  vio-
lence. 

I should interject here that there are many different types of con-
cerns  that  apply  to  this  topic  area—moral  and  ethical.  The  points 
I want to emphasize are public health concerns. 

Violence in our society is a public health issue. The statistical re-
lationship  between  children’s  exposure  to  violent  portrayals  and 
their subsequent aggressive behavior has been shown to be strong-
er than the relationship between asbestos exposure and the risk of 
laryngeal cancer, the relationship between condom use and the risk 
of  contracting  HIV,  and  exposure  to  secondhand  smoke  in  the 
workplace  and  the  risk  of  lung  cancer.  There  is  no  controversy  in 
the  medical  public-health  or  social-science  communities  about  the 
risks  of  harmful  effects  from  children’s  exposure  to  TV  violence; 
rather, there is strong consensus that such exposure is a significant 
public health concern. 

Now,  besides  studying  the  effects  of  TV  violence,  research  has 
also  examined  the  nature  and  extent  of  violence  on  television,  and 
this body of evidence affords several conclusions across studies. 

First,  violence  is  widespread  across  the  television  landscape. 
Turn  on  a  television  set  and  pick  a  channel  at  random.  The  odds 
are  better  than  50/50  that  the  program  you  encounter  will  contain 
violent  material.  Sixty  percent  of  approximately  10,000  programs 
that  were  sampled  for  the  National  Television  Violence  Study  con-
tained  violent  material.  That  study  identified  an  average  of  6,000 
violent  interactions  in  a  single  week  of  programming  across  23 
channels  that  we  studied,  including  both  broadcast  and  cable  net-
works.  More  than  half  of  the  violent  shows  contained  lethal  acts, 
and  roughly  one  in  four  included  violence  depicting  the  use  of  a 
gun. 

A second content-based conclusion: Most violence on television is 
presented  in  a  manner  that  actually  enhances  its  risk  of  harmful 
effects  on  child  viewers.  More  specifically,  most  violence  on  tele-
vision follows a highly formulaic pattern that is both sanitized and 
glamorized.  By  ‘‘sanitized,’’  I  mean  portrayals  that  fail  to  show  re-
alistic harms to victims, both from a short- and long-term perspec-
tive. And by ‘‘glamorized,’’ I mean violence that is performed by at-
tractive  role  models  who  are  often  justified  for  acting  aggressively 
and  who  suffer  no  remorse,  criticism,  or  penalty  for  their  violent

behavior.  And  it’s  quite  unfortunate  that  these  types  of  portrayals 
enhance the risk of harmful effects. 

19 

In  sum,  it’s  clear  that  the  level  of  violence  on  television  poses 
cause for concern. The question is, what does all this mean for pub-
lic  policymakers?  While  exposure  to  media  violence  is  not  nec-
essarily  the  most  potent  factor  contributing  to  violence  in  society, 
it is certainly the most pervasive. Millions of children spend an av-
erage  of  20  hours  or  more  per  week  watching  TV,  and  this  cumu-
lative exposure to violent images shapes young minds in unhealthy 
ways.  Given  the  free  speech  guarantees  of  the  First  Amendment, 
the  courts  have  ruled  that  there  must  be  evidence  of  a  compelling 
governmental  interest  in  order  for  Congress  to  take  action  that  in 
any  way  would  regulate  television.  In  my  view,  the  empirical  evi-
dence documenting the risk of harmful effects from children’s expo-
sure  to  TV  violence  clearly  meets  this  threshold.  And  I  think  it’s 
important  to  underscore  that  former  Attorney  General  Janet  Reno 
offered an identical opinion to this very Committee when she testi-
fied before it in the 1990s. 

To  conclude,  the  scientific  evidence  about  the  effects  of  TV  vio-
lence on children cannot clarify which path is best for policymakers 
to pursue in addressing this concern. That decision rests with your 
value  judgments  based  upon  the  relative  importance  that  each  of 
you  place  on  the  protection  of  children,  as  compared  to  other  com-
peting factors, such as protecting free speech. But, when you make 
that  judgment,  as  each  member  on  this  Committee  is  ultimately 
going  to  be  asked  to  do,  it  is  critical  that  you  understand  that  TV 
violence  harms  large  numbers  of  children  in  this  country  and  sig-
nificantly increases violence in our society.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DALE KUNKEL, PH.D., PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF 

COMMUNICATION, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA 

I have studied children and media issues for over 20 years, and am one of several 
researchers  who  led  the  National  Television  Violence  Study  (NTVS)  in  the  1990s, 
a  project  widely  recognized  as  the  largest  scientific  study  of  media  violence.  In  my 
remarks  here  today,  I  will  briefly  report  some  key  findings  from  the  NTVS  project, 
as  well  as  summarize  the  state  of  knowledge  in  the  scientific  community  about  the 
effects of media violence on children. 
The Effects of Television Violence 

Concern  on  the  part  of  the  public  and  Congress  about  the  harmful  influence  of 
media  violence  on  children  dates  back  to  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and  remains  strong 
today. The legitimacy of that concern is corroborated by extensive scientific research 
that  has  accumulated  over  the  past  40  years.  Indeed,  in  reviewing  the  totality  of 
empirical evidence regarding the impact of media violence, the conclusion that expo-
sure  to  violent  portrayals  poses  a  risk  of  harmful  effects  on  children  has  been 
reached  by  the  U.S.  Surgeon  General,  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health,  the 
National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  American  Medical  Association,  the  American 
Psychological  Association,  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  and  a  host  of  other 
scientific and public health agencies and organizations. 

These  harmful  effects  are  grouped  into  three  primary  categories:  (1)  children’s 
learning  of  aggressive  attitudes  and  behaviors;  (2)  desensitization,  or  an  increased 
callousness toward victims of violence; and (3) increased or exaggerated fear of being 
victimized  by  violence.  While  all  of  these  effects  reflect  adverse  outcomes,  it  is  the 
first—an  increased  propensity  for  violent  behavior—that  is  at  the  core  of  public 
health  concern  about  televised  violence.  The  statistical  relationship  between  chil-
dren’s  exposure  to  violent  portrayals  and  their  subsequent  aggressive  behavior  has 
been shown to be stronger than the relationship between asbestos exposure and the 
risk  of  laryngeal  cancer;  the  relationship  between  condom  use  and  the  risk  of  con-
tracting  HIV;  and  exposure  to  second-hand  smoke  in  the  workplace  and  the  risk  of

lung cancer. There is no controversy in the medical, public health, and social science 
communities about the risk of harmful effects from children’s exposure to media vio-
lence. Rather, there is strong consensus that exposure to media violence is a signifi-
cant public health concern. 
Key Conclusions about the Portrayal of Violence on Television 

Drawing  upon  evidence  from  the  National  Television  Violence  Study,  as  well  as 
other  related  research,  there  are  several  evidence-based  conclusions  that  can  be 
drawn regarding the presentation of violence on television. 
1. Violence is widespread across the television landscape. 

Turn  on  a  television  set  and  pick  a  channel  at  random;  the  odds  are  better  than 
50/50 that the program you encounter will contain violent material. To be more pre-
cise,  60  percent  of  approximately  10,000  programs  sampled  for  the  National  Tele-
vision  Violence  Study  contained  violent  material.  That  study  identified  an  average 
of 6,000 violent interactions in a single week of programming across the 23 channels 
that  were  examined,  including  both  broadcast  and  cable  networks.  More  than  half 
of  the  violent  shows  (53  percent)  contained  lethal  acts,  and  one  in  four  of  the  pro-
grams with violence (25 percent) depicted the use of a gun. 
2.  Most  violence  on  television  is  presented  in  a  manner  that  increases  its  risk  of 

harmful effects on child-viewers. 

More  specifically,  most  violence  on  television  follows  a  highly  formulaic  pattern 

that is both sanitized and glamorized. 

By  sanitized,  I  mean  that  portrayals  fail  to  show  realistic  harm  to  victims,  both 
from a short and long-term perspective. Immediate pain and suffering by victims of 
violence  is  included  in  less  than  half  of  all  scenes  of  violence.  More  than  a  third 
of  violent  interactions  depict  unrealistically  mild  harm  to  victims,  grossly  under-
stating  the  severity  of  injury  that  would  occur  from  such  actions  in  the  real  world. 
In sum, most depictions sanitize violence by making it appear to be much less pain-
ful and less harmful than it really is. 

By  glamorized,  I  mean  that  violence  is  performed  by  attractive  role  models  who 
are  often  justified  for  acting  aggressively  and  who  suffer  no  remorse,  criticism,  or 
penalty  for  their  violent  behavior.  More  than  a  third  of  all  violence  is  committed 
by  attractive  characters,  and  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  violence  they  commit  oc-
curs without any signs of punishment. 

Violence  that  is  presented  as  sanitized  or  glamorized  poses  a  much  greater  risk 
of adverse effects on children than violence that is presented with negative outcomes 
such as pain and suffering for its victims or negative consequences for its perpetra-
tors. 
3.  The  overall  presentation  of  violence  on  television  has  remained  remarkably  stable 

over time. 

The National Television Violence Study examined programming for 3 years in the 
1990s  and  found  a  tremendous  degree  of  consistency  in  the  pattern  of  violent  por-
trayals  throughout  the  television  landscape.  Across  the  entire  study  of  roughly 
10,000  programs,  the  content  measures  which  examined  the  nature  and  extent  of 
violence  varied  no  more  than  a  percent  or  two  from  year  to  year.  Similar  studies 
that  have  been  conducted  since  that  time  have  produced  quite  comparable  results. 
This  consistency  clearly  implies  that  the  portrayal  of  violence  on  television  is 
highly stable and formulaic—and unfortunately, this formula of presenting violence 
as  glamorized  and  sanitized  is  one  that  enhances  its  risk  of  harmful  effects  for  the 
child audience. 

In  sum,  the  evidence  clearly  establishes  that  the  level  of  violence  on  television 
poses substantial cause for concern. It demonstrates that violence is a central aspect 
of  television  programming  that  enjoys  remarkable  consistency  and  stability  over 
time. 
Implications for Public Policy 

It  is  well  established  by  a  compelling  body  of  scientific  evidence  that  television 
violence  poses  a  risk  of  harmful  effects  for  child-viewers.  While  exposure  to  media 
violence is not necessarily the most potent factor contributing to real world violence 
and  aggression  in  the  United  States  today,  it  is  certainly  the  most  pervasive.  Mil-
lions of children spend an average of 20 or more hours per week watching television, 
and this cumulative exposure to violent images can shape young minds in unhealthy 
ways. 

Given  the  free  speech  guarantees  of  the  First  Amendment,  the  courts  have  ruled 
that  there  must  be  evidence  of  a  ‘‘compelling  governmental  interest’’  in  order  for 
Congress  to  take  action  that  would  regulate  television  content  in  any  way,  such  as

the  indecency  regulations  enforced  by  the  FCC.  In  my  view,  the  empirical  evidence 
documenting  the  risk  of  harmful  effects  from  children’s  exposure  to  televised  vio-
lence  clearly  meets  this  threshold,  and  I  should  note  that  former  Attorney  General 
Janet Reno offered an identical opinion to this Committee when she testified before 
it on this same issue in the 1990s. 

There has been a lot of talk in recent weeks about the U.S. Court of Appeals (2nd 
Circuit)  ruling  regarding  ‘‘fleeting  expletives’’  that  were  cited  as  indecent  by  the 
FCC  (Fox  et  al.,  v.  FCC,  June  4,  2007).  Some  have  suggested  this  ruling  threatens 
the future of any content-based television regulation. While I am not a legal expert, 
let me draw several important distinctions between this indecency case and the situ-
ation policy-makers face with the issue of television violence. First, there is no clear 
foundation  of  empirical  evidence  to  document  the  effects  of  children’s  exposure  to 
indecent material in any quantity, much less modest and fleeting examples of it. In 
contrast,  there  is  an  elaborate,  solid  foundation  of  evidence  regarding  the  cumu-
lative effects of televised violence on children. While ‘‘fleeting expletives’’ occur occa-
sionally  on  television,  they  are  generally  quite  rare.  In  contrast,  violent  portrayals 
are  not  only  common,  they  are  pervasive  across  the  television  landscape,  and  are 
found in a majority of programs. 

Indeed, it is the cumulative nature of children’s exposure to thousands and thou-
sands  of  violent  images  over  time  that  constitutes  the  risk  of  harmful  effects.  Just 
as  medical  researchers  cannot  quantify  the  effect  of  smoking  one  cigarette,  media 
violence  researchers  cannot  specify  the  effect  of  watching  just  a  single  violent  pro-
gram.  But  as  exposure  accrues  over  time,  year  in  and  year  out,  a  child  who  is  a 
heavy  viewer  of  media  violence  is  significantly  more  likely  to  behave  aggressively. 
This relationship is the same as that faced by the smoker who lights up hour after 
hour,  day  after  day,  over  a  number  of  years,  increasing  their  risk  of  cancer  with 
every puff. 

The  scientific  evidence  about  the  effects  of  televised  violence  on  children  cannot 
clarify  which  path  is  the  best  for  policymakers  to  pursue  to  address  the  problems 
that  research  in  this  area  has  identified.  That  decision  rests  more  in  value  judg-
ments, based upon the relative importance that each of you place on protecting chil-
dren’s  health  as  contrasted  with  the  other  competing  interests  involved,  such  as 
freedom  of  speech  concerns.  But  when  you  make  that  judgment—as  each  Member 
of this committee will eventually be called upon to do—it is critical that you under-
stand that television violence harms large numbers of children in this country, and 
significantly increases violence in our society. 

To  conclude,  the  research  evidence  in  this  area  establishes  clearly  that  the  level 
of violence on television poses substantial cause for concern. Content analysis stud-
ies demonstrate that violence is a central aspect of television programming that en-
joys remarkable consistency and stability over time. And effects research, including 
correlational, experimental, and longitudinal designs, converge to document the risk 
of  harmful  psychological  effects  on  child-viewers.  Collectively,  these  findings  from 
the  scientific  community  make  clear  that  television  violence  is  a  troubling  problem 
for  our  society.  I  applaud  this  Committee  for  considering  the  topic,  and  exploring 
potential policy options that may reduce or otherwise ameliorate the harmful effects 
of children’s exposure to television violence.

The APA is the largest organization representing psychology, and

chology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting 
health education and human welfare.

Commission’s  V-Chip  Task  Force,  and  as  a  current  member  of  the 
Oversight Monitoring Board for the Television Rating System. 

22 

I  also  co-chair  the  Children’s  Media  Policy  Coalition,  a  national 
coalition  of  public-health,  child  advocacy,  and  education  groups, 
which  includes  among  them  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics, 
Children Now, and the National PTA. 

In  the  late  1990s,  tragic  acts  of  violence  in  our  schools  directed 
our  Nation’s  attention  to  the  serious  problem  of  youth  violence. 
School  shootings  in  Paducah,  Kentucky;  Jonesboro,  Arkansas; 
Edinboro,  Pennsylvania;  Springfield,  Oregon;  and  Littleton,  Colo-
rado,  and,  more  recently,  in  Blacksburg,  Virginia,  have  brought 
about  a  national  conversation  of  the  origins  of  youth  violence  and 
what  we,  as  parents,  as  psychologists,  and  as  public  policymakers, 
can do to prevent more incidents of violence. 

Years  of  psychological  research  on  violence  prevention  and  child 
development  has  helped  inform  and  continues  to  address  this  cur-
rent  need.  While  the  foundations  of  acts  of  violence  are  complex 
and variable, certain risk factors have been established in the psy-
chological literature. Among the factors that place youth at risk for 
committing an act of violence is exposure to violence. This includes, 
but is not limited to, acts of violence in the media. Foremost in the 
conclusions  drawn  on  the  basis  of  more  than  30  years  of  research 
contributed  by  APA  members,  such  as  the  U.S.  Surgeon  General’s 
report  in  1972,  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health’s  report  in 
1982,  and,  as  Dr.  Kunkel  just  referred  to,  the  National  Television 
Violence  Study,  shows  that  repeated  exposure  to  violence  in  the 
mass  media  places  children  at  risk  for  increases  in  aggression,  de-
sensitization to acts of violence, and unrealistic increases in fear of 
becoming a victim of violence. 

This research has provided the foundation upon which represent-
atives  of  the  public  health  community,  comprised  of  the  American 
Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and 
the  American  Medical  Association  issued  a  landmark  consensus 
statement  in  2000  regarding  the  state  of  the  science  on  the  effects 
of  media  violence  on  children.  Certain  psychological  facts  are  well 
established in this debate. As APA member Dr. Rowell Huesmann, 
of  the  University  of  Michigan,  stated  before  this  very  Committee, 
just as every cigarette you smoke increases the chances that some-
day  you  will  get  cancer,  every  exposure  to  violence  increases  the 
chances  that  someday  a  child  will  behave  more  violently  than  he 
or she otherwise would. 

Hundreds  of  studies  have  confirmed  that  exposing  our  children 
to  a  steady  diet  of  violence  makes  them  more  violence  prone.  The 
psychological  processes  here  are  not  mysterious.  Children  learn  by 
observing  others.  Mass  media  and  the  advertising  world  provide  a 
very  attractive  window  for  these  observations.  Excellent  children’s 
pro-social programming, such as Sesame Street, and pro-social mar-
keting,  such  as  that  around  helmets  for  skateboarding,  are  to  be 
commended and supported. Psychological research shows that what 
is  responsible  for  the  effectiveness  of  good  children’s  programming 
and  pro-social  marketing  is  that  children  learn  from  their  media 
environment. If children can learn positive behaviors this way, they 
can learn harmful ones, as well.

As  I  mentioned  before  this  Committee  last  year,  the  rating  sys-
tem  merits  attention  in  this  discussion.  There  continues  to  be  con-
cern arising from the ambiguity and the implementation in the cur-
rent  television  rating  system.  The  rating  system  can  be,  and  has 
been,  undermined  by  the  marketing  efforts  of  the  very  groups  re-
sponsible  for  its  implementation  and  effectiveness;  for  instance, 
marketing  adult  rated  programming  to  children.  This  displays  a 
significant  lack  of  accountability  and  should  be  considered  when 
proposals  for  industry  self-regulation  are  discussed.  At  the  very 
least,  the  industry  is  failing  to  actively  promote  its  rating  system, 
except in response to possible government oversight. 

Where  the  vast  amount  of  scientific  data  and  agreement  in  the 
public health community is, regarding children’s health, is that ex-
posure  to  violence  in  the  media  is  a  significant  concern  and  risk 
factor for individual children’s health. 

There is also a growing body of research on the health impact of 
sexualized images, on young girls specifically. This was detailed in 
the recent APA Task Force Report on the Sexualization of Girls. 

Now,  in  terms  of  the  recent  Circuit  Court  ruling,  it’s  important 
to  mention  that  there  is  very  little  scientific  evidence  that  docu-
ments  the  effects  of  fleeting  expletives  on  children.  This  is  not  to 
say  it’s  not  a  concern,  as  many  parents  groups,  such  as  Mr.  Win-
ter’s  groups,  will  point  out;  however,  in  these  instances,  if  the  in-
tent  of  regulating  speech  is  concerned  with  the  exposure  of  chil-
dren—and  that’s  referencing  the  original  Pacifica  case—then  that 
concern is about the harm that is done to children. 

Now, if harm or risk to children is the concern, then we must es-

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JEFF J. MCINTYRE, SENIOR LEGISLATIVE AND FEDERAL 
AFFAIRS OFFICER, PUBLIC POLICY OFFICE, AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION 
Good  morning.  I  am  Jeff  McIntyre,  and  I  am  honored  to  be  here  today  to  rep-
resent the American Psychological Association (APA). The APA is the largest organi-
zation  representing  psychology  and  has  over  148,000  members  and  affiliates  work-
ing  to  advance  psychology  as  a  science,  a  profession,  and  as  a  means  of  promoting 
health, education, and human welfare. 

My  years  of  policy  experience  related  to  children  and  the  media  include  serving 
as  a  negotiator  for  the  development  of  a  television  ratings  system,  as  an  advisor  to 
the  Federal  Communications  Commission’s  V-Chip  Task  Force,  and  as  a  current 
member  of  the  Oversight  Monitoring  Board  for  the  television  ratings  system.  I  also 
co-chair  the  Children’s  Media  Policy  Coalition,  a  national  coalition  of  public  health, 
child  advocacy,  and  education  groups,  including  the  American  Academy  of  Pediat-
rics, Children Now, and the National PTA. 

In the late 1990s, tragic acts of violence in our schools directed our Nation’s atten-
tion  to  the  serious  problem  of  youth  violence.  School  shootings  in  Paducah,  Ken-
tucky;  Jonesboro,  Arkansas;  Edinboro,  Pennsylvania;  Springfield,  Oregon;  and 
Littleton, Colorado, and, more recently, in Blacksburg, Virginia, have brought about 
a  national  conversation  on  the  origins  of  youth  violence  and  what  we—as  parents,

psychologists,  and  public  policymakers—can  do  to  prevent  more  incidents  of  vio-
lence. 

Years of psychological research on violence prevention and child development has 
helped  inform,  and  continue  to  address,  this  urgent  need.  While  the  foundations  of 
acts of violence are complex and variable, certain risk factors have been established 
in  the  psychological  literature.  Among  the  factors  that  place  youth  at  risk  for  com-
mitting  an  act  of  violence  are  exposure  to  acts  of  violence.  This  includes,  but  is  not 
limited to, those in the media. 

Foremost,  the  conclusions  drawn  on  the  basis  of  more  than  30  years  of  research 
contributed  by  APA  members—as  highlighted  in  the  U.S.  Surgeon  General’s  report 
in  1972,  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health’s  report  in  1982,  and  the  three- 
year  National  Television  Violence  Study  in  the  1990s—shows  that  repeated  expo-
sure to violence in the mass media places children at risk for: 

• increases in aggression; 
• desensitization to acts of violence; 
• and unrealistic increases in fear of becoming a victim of violence, which results 
in the development of other negative characteristics, such as mistrust of others. 
This  research  provided  the  foundation  upon  which  representatives  of  the  public 
health community—comprised of the American Psychological Association, the Amer-
ican  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  and  the  American  Medical  Association—issued  a  land-
mark  consensus  statement  in  2000  regarding  the  state-of-the-science  on  the  effects 
of media violence on children. 

Certain  psychological  facts  are  well  established  in  this  debate.  As  APA  member 
Dr. Rowell Huesmann of the University of Michigan stated before the Senate Com-
merce  Committee—just  as  every  cigarette  you  smoke  increases  the  chances  that, 
someday, you will get cancer, every exposure to violence increases the chances that, 
some day, a child will behave more violently than he or she otherwise would. 

Hundreds  of  studies  have  confirmed  that  exposing  our  children  to  a  steady  diet 
of  violence  makes  them  more  violence  prone.  The  psychological  processes  here  are 
not mysterious. Children learn by observing others. Mass media and the advertising 
world provide a very attractive window for these observations. 

Excellent children’s pro-social programming (such as Sesame Street) and pro-social 
marketing  (such  as  that  around  helmets  for  skateboarding)  are  to  be  commended 
and  supported.  Psychological  research  shows  that  what  is  responsible  for  the  effec-
tiveness  of  good  children’s  programming  and  pro-social  marketing  is  that  children 
learn  from  their  media  environment.  If  children  can  learn  positive  behaviors  this 
way, they can learn harmful ones as well. 

As  I  mentioned  before  this  committee  last  year,  the  ratings  system  merits  atten-
tion  in  this  discussion.  There  continues  to  be  concern  arising  from  the  ambiguity 
in the implementation of the current ratings system. The ratings system can be un-
dermined  by  the  marketing  efforts  of  the  very  groups  responsible  for  its  implemen-
tation and effectiveness (e.g., marketing adult-rated programs to children). This dis-
plays  a  significant  lack  of  accountability  and  should  be  considered  when  proposals 
for  industry  self-regulation  are  discussed.  At  the  very  least,  the  industry  is  failing 
to  actively  promote  its  rating  system,  except  in  response  to  possible  government 
oversight. 

Where the vast amount of scientific data and agreement in the public health com-
munity  is—regarding  children’s  health—is  that  exposure  to  violence  in  the  media 
is a significant concern and risk factor for individual children’s health. There is also 
a  growing  body  of  research  on  the  health  impact  of  sexualized  images—on  young 
girls  specifically—as  detailed  in  the  recent  APA  Task  Force  Report  on  the 
Sexualization of Girls. 

In  terms  of  the  recent  Circuit  court  ruling,  it’s  important  to  mention  that  there 
is very little scientific evidence that documents the effects of ‘‘fleeting expletives’’ on 
children.  This  is  not  to  say  that  it  is  not  a  concern—as  many  parents  groups  will 
point  out.  However,  in  these  instances,  if  the  intent  of  regulating  speech  is  con-
cerned  with  the  exposure  of  children—to  reference  the  original  Pacifica  case—then 
that concern is about the harm that is done to children. 

If harm or risk to children is the concern, then we must establish a standard upon 
which  all  children  may  benefit  equally.  That  foundation  should  be  a  health  based 
standard,  based  on  decades  of  child  psychology  and  research  on  child  development. 
We know exposure to violence is a risk factor for committing later acts of violence. 
The  more  a  child  is  exposed  to  violence—in  the  schools,  in  the  family,  in  the 
media—the more prone they are to committing acts of violence later in life. 

In conclusion, a detailed, content-based ratings system is a vital step toward giv-
ing parents the information they need to make choices about their children’s media

habits.  Decades  of  psychological  research  bear  witness  to  the  potential  harmful  ef-
fects for our children and our Nation if these practices continue. 

Chairman Inouye and distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for in-
viting me to present this testimony today. Please regard me and the American Psy-
chological  Association  as  a  resource  to  the  Committee  in  your  deliberations  on  this 
important matter. 

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  Mr.  Tribe,  you’ll  forgive  me  for  this,  I 
hope—you  probably  won’t,  but  it  needs  to  be  said,  because  you’re 
such  a  national  figure,  associated  more  with  the  Supreme  Court 
than with testifying here—but it should be known by my colleagues 
that you come here as a consultant for cable, networks and movies. 

UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, PROFESSOR 

STATEMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, CARL M. LOEB 
OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL; 

ON BEHALF OF THE AD HOC MEDIA COALITION 

Mr.  TRIBE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I’m  trying  to  turn  the 

microphone on. Is it on? 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Yes, it is. 
Mr.  TRIBE.  I’m  honored  to  be  here,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  here  as 
a  consultant,  but  I’ve  made  it  clear  in  a  footnote  to  my  testimony 
that  I  am  saying  what  I  believe  and  only  what  I  believe  even 
though  in  some  instances  it  is  not  what  those  that  I’m  consulting 
for  believe.  I’m  here,  not  representing  Harvard,  not  representing 
any particular group, but stating my own views. 

And I also want to stress that I’m here as a parent and a grand-
parent.  I  have  only  two  grandchildren—I  can’t  compete  with  some 
members  on  this  Committee—but  my  most  recent  grandson  was 
born 5 days ago. 

I care enormously, as a parent, about what children are exposed 
to  on  TV.  And,  if  I  may  be  so  permitted,  I’m  simply  going  to  talk 
extemporaneously  and  ask  that  my  prepared  statement  be  sub-
mitted  for  the  record,  because  I  want  to  speak  from  deep  feeling. 

When Dr. Kunkel said—— 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. It is included. 
Mr.  TRIBE.—that  the  issue  is  one  of  protecting  children  versus 
protecting  free  speech,  and  that  the  question  is  about  how  we 
prioritize  those  two  goals,  I  felt  myself  torn  asunder.  If  I  had  to 
choose  between  my  children  and  my  grandchildren  and  the  Con-
stitution,  I  suppose  I’d  resign  from  the  human  race.  But  I  don’t 
think  I  have  to  choose,  and  I  don’t  think  this  Committee  has  to 
choose either. 

I  think  that,  in  the  long  run,  it  is  not  in  the  interest  of  my  chil-
dren,  my  grandchildren,  or  any  of  the  children  or  grandchildren  of 
this or any other generation to sacrifice free speech on the altar of 
protecting children. In the long run, it is not in the interest of our 
children  that  Big  Brother  decides  what  are  suitable  and  what  are 
unsuitable depictions of violence on television. 

When  I  hear  that  much  of  the  harm  of  violent  depictions  is  a 
function of how sanitized or how glamorized the violence is, I hear 
the  language  of  viewpoint  discrimination.  Yes,  I  recognize  that  it 
is  more  harmful  for  my  kids  to  see  the  hero  on  a  program  be  re-
warded for violence. It might be helpful for them to see people who 
are evildoers get what’s theirs. But I don’t want President Bush or 
any  President  of  this  country,  or  any  chairman  of  the  FCC,  to  be

26 

deciding what is too sanitized, what’s too glamorous. We’ll never be 
perfectly  well  off  in  this  difficult  terrain.  But  in  the  long  run,  I 
think that we are better off improving the tools that parents have. 
Now,  Mr.  Chairman,  you  said,  ‘‘Parents  don’t  want  more  tools.’’ 
I beg to differ. I think parents want and need more usable V-Chips. 
They also have tools they often don’t know about, and a serious in-
formation  campaign  of  the  sort  that  Senator  Lautenberg  proposed 
might make a difference, as well. 

The  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  is  realistic  about  this. 
In  a  number  of  decisions  about  ‘‘indecency,’’  where  it  found  that 
word an unacceptably vague standard, or about ‘‘patently offensive 
content,’’  which  it  also  found  unacceptably  vague,  the  Court  recog-
nized that simply empowering parents is not a perfect solution. But 
the Court further recognized that empowering parents is a less re-
strictive  solution,  and  the  burden  is  on  government  to  make  it 
more effective, not on government to simply turn over to Big Broth-
er the keys to the television. 

I  very  much  agree  with  Vice  Chairman  Stevens  when  he  says 
that  we  can’t  forget  about  the  First  Amendment  here.  And  it’s  not 
simply  because  I  like  writing  about  the  First  Amendment  or  argu-
ing about it or teaching my students about it. It’s because I believe 
in  it.  I  believe  we  are  better  off  in  a  society  that  takes  free  speech 
seriously. 

Now, with all respect, Mr. Chairman, when you showed what you 
did  on  what  amounts  to  national  television  at  10  in  the  morning, 
I think you were making a judgment—a judgment I respect—about 
the best way to get this country moving on a subject you care pas-
sionately  about.  I  share  the  passion,  but  I  don’t  agree  with  the 
means. 

It  seems  to  me  that  the  objections  in  the  name  of  the  First 
Amendment  are  not  merely  technical  objections.  When  you  said 
that—and  I  think  I’m  quoting  you—‘‘defining  ‘decency’  is  difficult,’’ 
that  was  the  understatement  of  the  century.  It’s  impossible  for  us 
to  agree  upon  a  definition  of  what  is  indecent  for  our  kids  to  see. 
We  can  all  look  at  the  grotesque  images  that  you  showed  on  this 
screen and agree for ourselves we wouldn’t want our children to see 
that. I wouldn’t want to see it myself at 3 in the morning. But giv-
ing this power to government is not the solution. 

When you hear testimony that there is better evidence about the 
harm  of  violence  on  television  than  there  is  about  the  harm  of  as-
bestos or the harm of smoking, I beg you to understand or remem-
ber  what  you  all  know:  there  is  a  difference  between  asbestos  and 
speech,  and  there  is  a  difference  between  nicotine  and  content. 
Even  if  you  try  to  package  a  solution  to  this  problem  in  economic 
language  by  making  programming  go  a` la  carte,  you’ll  have  not 
only  the  unintended  effects  that  Senator  Smith  talks  about.  (I  be-
lieve  that  when  he  talks  about  children’s  programs  that  would  be 
lost  if  we  mandate  a` la  carte,  that’s  simply  an  example  of  the  fact 
that  there  will  be  major  impact  on  content.)  Can  you  imagine  tell-
ing  a  newspaper  that  it  had  to  make  its  various  sections  available 
a` la  carte?  Can  you  imagine  telling  musicians  that  they  couldn’t 
package records the way they wanted to? In the end, we’re talking 
about content, and we’re talking about viewpoint, and we’re talking

about it in terms that, if we give the power to government, will be 
unconstitutionally vague. 

We  may  feel  better  about  having  done  something,  finally,  by 
passing a statute in this area, but it’s not about feeling good when 
the  courts  come  right  back  and  strike  it  down;  it’s  about  making 
a  difference.  And  to  make  a  difference,  you  have  to  address  what 
Senator  Lautenberg  referred  to:  the  fundamental  human  appetite 
for  this  disgusting  stuff.  If  we  address  this  appetite  through  edu-
cation  and  through  information,  we  won’t  solve  the  problem  per-
fectly,  but  we’ll  come  closer  than  if  we  do  violence  to  the  First 
Amendment. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
[The prepared statement of Mr. Tribe follows:] 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF LAURENCE H.  TRIBE,* CARL M.  LOEB UNIVERSITY 
PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HARVARD 
LAW SCHOOL; ON BEHALF OF THE AD HOC MEDIA COALITION 
Chairman  Inouye,  Vice  Chairman  Stevens,  and  distinguished  members  of  the 
Committee:  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  testify  about  the  constitutionality  of  the 
legislative proposals made by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in its 
recent report on television violence. 

That  Report  concludes  that  there  is  evidence—which  the  Report  concedes  to  be 
mixed and uncertain—that certain depictions of violence on television correlate with 
harmful  effects  on  children,  including  short-term  aggressive  behavior  and  feelings 
of  distress,  and  that  the  existing  V-Chip  regime,  based  on  the  industry’s  voluntary 
ratings system, has been insufficiently effective at keeping violent content from chil-
dren. On that basis, the Report recommends three legislative responses: time chan-
neling,  which  would  ban  some  content  during  certain  hours;  a  mandatory,  govern-
ment-run  ratings  program  to  replace  the  current  voluntary  system;  and  mandatory 
unbundling, or a` la carte cable/satellite programming, to require cable and satellite 
providers  to  give  consumers  a  choice  of  opting  in  or  out  of  channels  or  bundles  of 
channels. 

However,  as  Commissioner  Adelstein  forthrightly  acknowledges  in  his  separate 
statement, ‘‘the Report diminishes the extent to which courts have either expressed 
serious skepticism or invalidated efforts to regulate violent content.’’ FCC Report at 
32. In my view, the First Amendment renders invalid and would be invoked by the 
Supreme Court to strike down legislation adopting any or all of the FCC’s proposals. 
In  raising  these  First  Amendment  concerns,  I  certainly  do  not  mean  to  deny  that 
parents  have  legitimate  interests  in  what  their  children  see  on  television.  I  am  not 
only  a  father  but  a  grandfather,  and  I  believe  that  not  everything  on  television  is 
appropriate  for  young  children  to  view—as  the  broadcasters  and  cablecasters  ac-
knowledge, both in their public statements and in their voluntary ratings. 

I  also  do  not  mean  to  suggest  that  Congress  is  helpless  to  assist  parents  in  this 
area.  But  the  fundamental  error  of  the  FCC  Report  lies  in  its  belief  that  the  most 
appropriate  response  to  concerns  about  television  programs  containing  violent 
scenes  or  elements  is  more  intrusive  governmental  control  over  the  free  flow  of 
speech,  rather  than  more  narrowly  tailored  and  far  less  restrictive  alternatives  to 
facilitate greater parental control. Such use of centralized government regulation is 
antithetical to the letter and spirit of the Constitution. 

At  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  emphasize  that  violent  television  programming  is 
speech  protected  by  the  First  Amendment—a  point  that  the  FCC  Report  concedes. 

* Carl  M.  Loeb  University  Professor,  Harvard  University;  Professor  of  Constitutional  Law, 
Harvard  Law  School.  My  research  and  teaching  focus  primarily  on  the  United  States  Constitu-
tion,  including  the  First  Amendment.  I  am  the  author  of  American  Constitutional  Law,  which 
has been cited in more than 60 Supreme Court cases, and of numerous law review articles and 
books  on  constitutional  analysis.  I  have  also  briefed  and  argued  a  number  of  cases  before  the 
Supreme  Court  on  First  Amendment  issues,  among  others.  In  connection  with  this  testimony, 
I have been retained—through the auspices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, for which 
I serve as a consultant—by a coalition of affected media-related entities listed in the Appendix. 
However, the conclusions that I have reached, and that I express in this testimony, are my own 
and  not  those  of  Harvard  Law  School,  Harvard  University,  or  the  individual  members  of  the 
coalition.  My  conclusions  are  limited  to  the  Federal  constitutional  validity  of  various  proposed 
regulations.

At  the  most  fundamental  level,  any  attempt  to  regulate  such  protected  speech  will 
fail  because  it  will  be  impossible  to  define  ‘‘impermissible’’  depictions  of  violence  on 
television according to the strict constitutional requirements that govern laws regu-
lating  speech.  The  first  two  FCC  proposals  rely  on  their  face  upon  an  explicit  dis-
tinction  between  allowable  and  forbidden  violent  content.  And  even  the  third  FCC 
proposal—mandatory  unbundling—either  expressly  invokes  or  is  concededly  driven 
by  concerns  with  the  violent  content  that  the  first  two  proposals  would  overtly  ad-
dress. But such a distinction is necessarily ambiguous to the point of being unconsti-
tutionally  vague.  To  the  extent  that  the  First  Amendment  allows  regulation  of 
speech, it requires an extremely clear line between the permitted and the forbidden. 
In a great understatement, the FCC Report itself notes that drawing such a distinc-
tion  in  a  constitutionally  permissible  manner  would  be  ‘‘challenging,’’  FCC  Report 
at 18, and so the FCC declines to try to come up with such a definition itself, leav-
ing  the  task  to  Congress.  But  in  my  view,  any  attempt  to  come  up  with  a  constitu-
tionally  acceptable  definition  of  ‘‘impermissible’’  television  violence  is  more  than 
challenging—it is hopeless. The adoption of a line as amorphous as would inevitably 
result from such an attempt would chill protected speech, as broadcasters, cable/sat-
ellite operators, and artists react in altogether predictable ways to uncertainty over 
whether  they  will  face  punishment—and,  if  so,  how  severely  they  would  be  penal-
ized.  Moreover,  this  vague  prohibition  would  give  regulators  and  prosecutors  too 
much discretion to shape the content of free expression. 

Any  serious  attempt  to  regulate  violence  on  television  would  also  be  unconstitu-
tional  because  the  very  effort  on  government’s  part  to  regulate  televised  violence  is 
an attempt by government to dictate the right way to think and feel about violence. 
But  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  the  government  from  forcing  people  to  adopt  a 
particular  position  on  any  subject  of  debate,  whether  the  topic  is  global  warming, 
immigration, or violence. And even if one believes that the First Amendment allows 
legislatures  to  limit  the  availability  of  violent  content  for  the  sake  of  young  chil-
dren—a  conclusion  that  I  believe  is  inconsistent  with  constitutional  principle  and 
Supreme  Court  precedent,  which  recognizes  that  children  enjoy  First  Amendment 
protections  as  well—it  is  undeniable  that  the  First  Amendment  fully  protects  the 
rights  of  adults  and  older  children  to  view  televised  violence,  and  the  concomitant 
rights of broadcasters, cable/satellite operators, and artists to formulate and express 
that  content.  Whatever  Congress’s  power  to  protect  children,  it  cannot  regulate 
speech in a way that infringes on these fundamental rights. What is more, any law 
regulating violence would fail to achieve the purposes that would motivate its enact-
ment, and any such statute would be unconstitutional on those grounds alone. 

The FCC Report suggests that none of these concerns applies because the govern-
ment can regulate depictions of violence in the same way that it can regulate inde-
cency, and others have suggested analogizing regulations of televised violence to ob-
scenity laws. But depictions of violence cannot properly be equated or analogized to 
indecency or obscenity. 

Finally,  the  FCC  Report  downplays  and  in  some  respects  simply  ignores  a  large 
and  ever-growing  number  of  less  restrictive  means  by  which  parents  can  regulate 
the  exposure  of  their  young  children  to  televised  violence.  Changes  in  technology 
have made it increasingly easy for parents who wish to do so to block content from 
their children, household by household, program by program, child by child. Indeed, 
technological  advances  allow  parents  to  regulate  television  content  in  any  fashion 
that they desire—beyond narrow concerns with violence, sex, or other substantively 
identified  facets  of  the  content  to  which  their  children  are  exposed.  The  First 
Amendment  forbids  more  intrusive,  centralized,  one-size-fits-all  regulations  when 
such  less  restrictive,  more  individualized,  and  more  narrowly  tailored  means  are 
available.

II.  The  FCC’s  Proposals  Rely  upon  a  Constitutionally  Unacceptable 

Conception of ‘‘Impermissible’’ Depictions of Violence. 

A.  One  cannot  define  a  meaningfully  distinguishable  subcategory  of  objection-
able television violence in a way that is not unconstitutionally vague. 
B.  Any  plausible  definition  of  impermissible  television  violence  will  unconsti-

D.  Any  plausible  regulation  of  supposedly  unacceptable  television  violence  will 
contain  too  many  internal  inconsistencies  to  meet  First  Amendment  standards. 
III. Even Ignoring These Core Definitional Defects, the Fcc’s Proposals Cannot Be 

Reconciled with the First Amendment. 

A. Strict scrutiny applies to the FCC’s specific proposals to regulate violent tele-
vision programming. 

1.  Any  analogy  between  ‘‘violence’’  and  ‘‘indecency’’  or  ‘‘obscenity’’  cannot 
support  evaluating  the  FCC’s  proposals  under  anything  less  than  strict  scru-
tiny. 

2. Strict scrutiny applies to regulations intended to protect minors. 
3. Strict scrutiny applies to regulations of broadcast television content. 

B.  Under  strict  scrutiny,  the  FCC’s  proposals  share  a  common  flaw:  they  are 
not the least restrictive means to satisfy the government’s interests. 

1.  Many  less  restrictive  alternatives  exist  to  respond  to  violent  television 

programming. 

2. These less restrictive alternatives embody the parent- and individual-cen-
tered  structures  for  regulating  speech  that  the  Supreme  Court  has  recognized 
as preferred by the First Amendment. 

3. The FCC’s criticisms of these alternatives do not save its proposals under 

the First Amendment. 
C. All of the FCC’s proposals accordingly violate the First Amendment. 

1. Time Channeling. 
2. Mandatory Ratings System. 
3. Mandatory Unbundling. 

a. First Amendment strict scrutiny applies to mandatory unbundling. 
b.  The  First  Amendment  scrutiny  of  unbundling  is  unaffected  by  the  in-

volvement of money. 

c.  Unbundling’s  burdens  on  First  Amendment  rights  cannot  be  justified.

I.  The  First  Amendment  Protects  Depictions  of  Violence  on  Such  Media  as 

Television 

The  FCC  Report  concedes  that  the  First  Amendment  protects  depictions  of  vio-
lence,  but  the  scope  and  rationale  of  this  protection  nevertheless  deserve  emphasis 
here.  In  Winters  v.  New  York,  333  U.S.  507  (1948),  the  Supreme  Court  considered 
the  constitutionality  of  a  state  law  criminalizing  the  sale  of  magazines  that  dis-
played  ‘‘stories  of  bloodshed,  lust  or  crime.’’  Id.  at  511.  New  York  argued  that  the 
First  Amendment  did  not  cover  these  magazines  because  they  were  merely  enter-
tainment  and  because  they  were  ‘‘sanguinary  or  salacious  publications.’’  Id.  at  510. 
The Court rejected these arguments, holding that ‘‘[w]hat is one man’s amusement, 
teaches another’s doctrine. Though we can see nothing of any possible value to soci-
ety  in  these  magazines,  they  are  as  much  entitled  to  the  protection  of  free  speech 
as the best of literature.’’ Id. The lower Federal courts have properly recognized that 
the  rule  announced  in  Winters  applies  to  depictions  of  violence  in  other  media  as 
well.  See,  e.g.,  Interactive  Digital  Software  Ass’n  v.  St.  Louis  County,  329  F.3d  954, 
960  (8th  Cir.  2003)  (‘‘IDSA’’  applying  First  Amendment  to  violent  video  games); 
American  Amusement  Machine  Ass’n  v.  Kendrick,  244  F.3d  572,  579–80  (7th  Cir. 
2001)  (applying  First  Amendment  to  violent  video  games);  Eclipse  Enterprises,  Inc. 
v.  Gulotta,  134  F.3d  63,  64  (2d  Cir.  1997)  (applying  First  Amendment  to  trading 
cards  depicting  violent  crimes);  Video  Software  Dealers  Ass’n  v.  Webster,  968  F.2d 
684,  691  (8th  Cir.  1992)  (applying  First  Amendment  to  videos  depicting  violence); 
American  Booksellers  Ass’n  v.  Hudnut,  771  F.2d  323,  330  (7th  Cir.  1985)  (noting 
that  depictions  of  violence  on  television  are  covered  by  the  First  Amendment).  Of 
course,  ‘‘programs  broadcast  by  . . .  television  . . .  [also]  fall  within  the  First 
Amendment guarantee.’’ Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 65 (1981). 

Thus,  violent  television  content—whether  it  educates  or  merely  entertains—is 
protected  by  the  First  Amendment.  This  conclusion  properly  recognizes  that  depic-
tions  of  violence  have  always  been  an  integral  part  of  expressive  speech.  From 
Greek mythology to the stories in the Bible, from Grimm’s Fairy Tales to innumer-
able  great  plays,  novels,  and  movies,  depictions  of  violence  have  long  played  a  role 
in the stories, fables, and narratives that illustrate and inform our notions of crime 
and punishment, evil and justice, right and wrong. The use of violence in television

programming is no different. Depictions of violence and its effects and consequences 
can  contribute  powerfully  to  a  show’s  portrayal  of  our  often  violent  world  or  its 
equally  violent  history,  and  the  use  of  violence—however  disquieting—adds  empha-
sis  that  is  nearly  impossible  to  achieve  otherwise.  For  example,  news  programs  re-
porting on a war could not be as truthful, nor achieve the same impact, if they shied 
away  from  violence,  and  a  Holocaust  documentary  that  unflinchingly  portrays  the 
atrocities  of  that  era  is  both  more  honest  and  more  effective  than  a  documentary 
on  the  same  subject  that  avoids  any  such  video  or  pictorial  depictions.  These  are 
contexts in which excising elements of violence would lie by omission. 

The  important  role  of  depictions  of  violence  holds  for  fictional  programming  as 
well. Many of our most popular and critically acclaimed television shows are indeli-
bly  associated  with  depictions  of  violence.  ‘‘The  Untouchables,’’  ‘‘Dragnet,’’  ‘‘Hawaii 
Five-O,’’  ‘‘Columbo,’’  ‘‘Rockford  Files,’’  ‘‘Murder,  She  Wrote,’’  ‘‘Hill  Street  Blues,’’ 
‘‘Law and Order,’’ ‘‘CSI’’—these and scores of other police and detective series would 
be  severely  weakened,  artistically  and  dramatically,  if  they  could  not  depict  with 
some  degree  of  verisimilitude  the  commission  and  consequences  of  violent  crimes 
and  the  physical  conduct  sometimes  necessary  on  the  part  of  law  enforcement  to 
bring wrongdoers to justice. Similarly, shows about espionage (e.g., ‘‘I Spy,’’ ‘‘Mission 
Impossible,’’  ‘‘24’’),  war  (e.g.,  ‘‘Combat,’’  ‘‘Twelve  O’Clock  High’’),  science  fiction  and 
the  supernatural  (e.g.,  Star  Trek,’’  ‘‘X-Files,’’  ‘‘Lost’’),  and  doctors  (e.g.,  ‘‘MASH,’’ 
‘‘ER,’’ ‘‘Grey’s Anatomy’’) would be greatly diminished in their power and their story- 
telling  if  they  could  not  contain  some  scenes  of  violence  or  its  effects,  as  well  as 
scenes showing surgical and other medical procedures. 

My point here is not that violence is necessary for television programs to express 
any ‘‘message,’’ or that it is impossible for these shows or others to continue in some 
form without portraying violence. Rather, my point is that all of these programs and 
many  others  would  be  drastically  different—and  considerably  less  valuable  as 
speech—if  they  were  forbidden  to  portray  physical  violence  and  its  consequences  in 
the way that they do. Whether fictional or nonfictional, journalistic or artistic, depic-
tions  of  violence  in  television  programming  are  entitled  to  the  powerful  protection 
of the First Amendment. 
II.  The  FCC’s  Proposals  Rely  upon  a  Constitutionally  Unacceptable 

Conception of ‘‘Impermissible’’ Depictions of Violence 

The FCC Report does not, of course, recommend that all violence on television be 
regulated.  Rather,  it  recommends  regulating  only  those  depictions  of  violence  that 
the  FCC  views  as  somehow  crossing  the  line  from  ‘‘permissibly  violent’’  to 
‘‘impermissibly violent.’’ 

All  of  the  FCC’s  proposals  necessarily  rely,  either  on  their  face  or  in  their  jus-
tification, on this distinction between permissible and impermissible depictions of vi-
olence.  Time  channeling  would  segregate  impermissibly  violent  television  program-
ming  into  late-night  time  slots,  while  allowing  permissibly  violent  programming  to 
be  aired  at  all  hours.  A  mandatory  ratings  system  would  impose  one  rating  on 
shows  with  permissible  violence  and  another,  presumably  more  severe,  rating  on 
shows  with  impermissible  violence.  Many  unbundling  proposals  require  cable/sat-
ellite  providers  to  separate  channels  with  permissible  violence  from  channels  with 
impermissible violence. And even unbundling proposals that are drafted without any 
mention of violent content are transparently driven by the same concerns. 

Although the distinction between permissible and impermissible views of violence 
thus lies at the heart of all of the FCC’s proposals, the Report provides little mean-
ingful guidance on the content of this distinction or on how to translate it into oper-
ative  language.  The  FCC’s  silence  is  telling.  It  is  not  difficult  to  see  why  any  at-
tempt  to  distinguish  between  permissible  and  impermissible  displays  of  violence— 
using  words  and  concepts  like  ‘‘excessive,’’  ‘‘gratuitous,’’  and  so  on—could  not  pass 
muster under First Amendment scrutiny. 

A.  One  cannot  define  a  meaningfully  distinguishable  subcategory  of  objection-
able television violence in a way that is not unconstitutionally vague. 

The  FCC  Report  proposes  that  Congress  regulate  ‘‘excessively  violent  program-
ming  that  is  harmful  to  children’’  on  television.  The  heart  of  any  such  law  will  be 
its definition of ‘‘excessively violent,’’ but any meaningful definition of ‘‘excessive vio-
lence’’—that is, any definition that prohibits a significant amount of the violent con-
tent  that  the  FCC  is  concerned  about—will  be  unacceptably  vague  because  it  will 
be  impossible  at  the  end  of  the  day  to  tell  what  the  definition  regulates  and  what 
it  does  not.  And  the  FCC  Report—despite  concluding  that  it  would  be  ‘‘possible’’  to 
develop  an  ‘‘appropriate’’  definition—fails  entirely  to  explain  what  that  definition 
should be or why it would pass constitutional muster.

The  Due  Process  Clause  requires  any  law,  whatever  its  context,  to  be  specific 
about  what  it  prohibits:  ‘‘a  statute  which  either  forbids  or  requires  the  doing  of  an 
act  in  terms  so  vague  that  men  of  common  intelligence  must  necessarily  guess  at 
its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process 
of  law.’’  Connally  v.  Gen.  Const.  Co.,  269  U.S.  385,  391  (1926);  Grayned  v.  City  of 
Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). Two principal concerns have driven this prohibi-
tion on vague laws, even when the First Amendment is not at stake. First, it is fun-
damentally unfair to punish a person for conduct he could not have known was pro-
hibited:  ‘‘Vague  laws  may  trap  the  innocent  by  not  providing  fair  warning.’’ 
Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108. Second, it is the lawmaker’s responsibility to decide what 
will  be  punished,  but  a  vague  law  in  effect  ‘‘impermissibly  delegates  basic  policy 
matters  to  policemen,  judges,  and  juries  for  resolution  on  an  ad  hoc  and  subjective 
basis.’’ Id. 108–09. 

Laws regulating speech are held to even ‘‘stricter standards’’ and must be particu-
larly  clear:  ‘‘[A]  man  may  the  less  be  required  to  act  at  his  peril’’  when  a  statute 
may have a ‘‘potentially inhibiting effect on speech,’’ because ‘‘the free dissemination 
of  ideas  may  be  the  loser.’’  Smith  v.  California,  361  U.S.  147,  151  (1959);  see  also 
Cramp  v.  Bd.  of  Pub.  Instruction,  368  U.S.  278,  288  (1961).  It  is  a  speaker’s  right 
to speak freely when what he wants to say does not violate any law, but vague laws 
‘‘inevitably  lead  citizens  to  ‘steer  far  wider  of  the  unlawful  zone’  . . .  than  if  the 
boundaries  of  the  forbidden  areas  were  clearly  marked,’’  thus  chilling  constitu-
tionally protected speech. Grayned, 408 U.S. at 109. 

The  prohibition  on  vagueness  becomes  no  less  stringent  simply  because  ‘‘a  par-
ticular  regulation  of  expression  . . .  was  adopted  for  the  salutary  purpose  of  pro-
tecting  children,’’  as  the  Supreme  Court  held  in  Interstate  Circuit,  Inc.  v.  City  of 
Dallas,  390  U.S.  676  (1968).  There,  the  Court  invalidated  a  statute  that  permitted 
a  movie  review  board  to  censor  films  that  the  board  deemed  ‘‘unsuitable’’  for  con-
sumption by children if, among other things, they described or portrayed ‘‘brutality, 
criminal  violence  or  depravity  in  such  a  manner  as  to  be,  in  the  judgment  of  the 
Board,  likely  to  incite  or  encourage  crime  or  delinquency.’’  The  Court  found  the 
phrase  ‘‘likely  to  incite’’  insufficiently  determinate,  in  effect  granting  the  board  a 
‘‘roving commission’’ to censor any films of which it disapproved. Id. at 688. For the 
same reason, the Second Circuit recently noted that the FCC’s efforts to protect chil-
dren  from  ‘‘indecent’’  language,  fleetingly  uttered,  was  likely  unconstitutional  be-
cause  the  FCC’s  vague  definition  of  indecency  ‘‘permits  the  FCC  to  sanction  speech 
based  on  its  subjective  view  of  the  merit  of  that  speech’’  and  thus  gives  ‘‘too  much 
discretion  to  government  officials.’’  Fox  Television  Stations,  Inc.  v.  FCC,l  F.3dl, 
No. 06–1760, slip op. at 34 (2d Cir. June 4, 2007). Even though the statute in Inter-
state  Circuit  and  the  regulation  in  Fox  both  sought  to  protect  children,  the  grants 
of  censorship  authority  were  void  for  vagueness  under  the  same  rule  that  would 
have applied had the statute sought only to protect adults. 

Despite these settled principles, the FCC surmises that it would be possible to es-
tablish a definition of ‘‘excessive violence’’ that would somehow satisfy the Constitu-
tion.  As  a  concrete  example,  the  FCC  suggests  that  Congress  could  prohibit  ‘‘depic-
tions of physical force against an animate being that, in context, are patently offen-
sive.’’  FCC  Report  at  20.  The  FCC  also  notes—without  explaining  whether  it  be-
lieves  they  would  be  constitutional—several  definitions  of  prohibited  violence  pro-
posed  by  commentators,  among  them  depictions  of  ‘‘outrageously  offensive  or  out-
rageously disgusting violence’’; of ‘‘severed or mutilated human bodies or body parts, 
in  terms  patently  offensive  as  measured  by  contemporary  community  standards  for 
the  broadcast  medium’’;  and  of  ‘‘intense,  rough  or  injurious  use  of  physical  force  or 
treatment either recklessly or with an apparent intent to harm.’’ 

None  of  these  proposed  definitions  is  specific  enough  to  give  broadcasters,  cable/ 
satellite operators, or regulators any real sense of what is prohibited, much less the 
precise  guidance  that  the  Constitution  demands.  Phrases  like  ‘‘outrageously  offen-
sive,’’  ‘‘patently  offensive,’’  ‘‘intense,’’  or  ‘‘rough’’  are  ‘‘classic  terms  of  degree’’—they 
measure  a  quality  speech  rather  than  delineating  a  firm  and  discrete  category  of 
speech. Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1049–49 (1991). As a result, 
they  do  not  offer  sufficient  guidance  because  a  person  of  ‘‘ordinary  intelligence’’ 
would have to guess at whether a particular program violates the rule. See Grayned, 
408 U.S. at 108. 

The impenetrable darkness into which such definitions would plunge writers, pro-
ducers, broadcasters, cable/satellite operators, and other creators and distributors of 
content is easily illustrated by reference to a recent report on television violence by

a  group  that  strongly  backs  government  regulation  of  television  violence.1 Among 
the  examples  of  television  programming  that  the  group  deems  objectionable,  and 
which it presumably would want to subject to government regulation and fines: 

• A little girl pulls another girl’s hair on an episode of ‘‘America’s Funniest Home 

• A ‘‘dead and bloodied body’’ is shown on an autopsy table in an episode of ‘‘Med-

Videos’’; 

ical Investigation’’; 

• A witness describes an alleged rape (never shown) on ‘‘Law and Order’’; 
• Two  bloody  murders  are  described,  but  not  shown,  and  the  bloody  crime  scene 

(without bodies) is depicted, on ‘‘Criminal Minds’’; 

• On  ‘‘CSI  Miami,’’  a  man  falls  into  the  water  and  is  surrounded  by  sharks.  His 
actual  death  is  not  shown,  but  ‘‘[b]lood  fills  the  water  and  one  of  the  man’s 
shoes is shown falling to the bottom of the ocean floor.’’ 

In  any  of  these  cases,  how  is  a  government  regulator  to  decide  whether  the  vio-
lence  is  ‘‘gratuitous,’’  ‘‘excessive,’’  and/or  ‘‘patently  offensive,’’  as  the  group  listing 
these  examples  evidently  believes?  Any  such  inquiry  would  be  unavoidably,  and  al-
most  entirely,  subjective,  leaving  a  creator  or  distributor  of  content  no  choice  but 
to  steer  far  clear  of  anything  that  might  be  deemed  objectionable  by  the  most  sen-
sitive viewer. 

The same concerns have driven the Court to strike down other statutes for vague-
ness. In the most directly applicable case, Winters v. New York, the Court paid spe-
cial attention to the way in which efforts to prevent regulations of violent materials 
from  being  fatally  overbroad  operated  to  render  such  regulations  unacceptably 
vague.  Thus,  in  striking  down  a  prohibition  on  violent  printed  materials  that  were 
‘‘so  massed  as  to  become  vehicles  for  inciting  violent  and  depraved  crimes  against 
the  person,’’  the  Court  in  Winters  noted  that  the  novelty  of  this  legislative  phrase 
showed  ‘‘the  utter  impossibility  of  the  actor  or  the  trier  to  know  where  this  new 
standard of guilt would draw the line between the allowable and the forbidden pub-
lications.’’ 333 U.S. at 519. 

Similarly,  in  Reno  v.  ACLU,  521  U.S.  844  (1997),  the  Supreme  Court  found 
impermissibly  vague  a  Federal  statute—the  Communications  Decency  Act  (CDA)— 
that  banned  the  online  distribution  of  ‘‘indecent’’  material  that,  ‘‘in  context, 
depict[ed]  or  describ[ed],  in  terms  patently  offensive  as  measured  by  contemporary 
community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.’’ 47 U.S.C. § 223(d)(1) 
(1994  ed.,  Supp.  II).  The  Court  concluded  that  this  standard  ‘‘lacks  the  precision 
that the First Amendment requires when a statute regulates the content of speech.’’ 
521  U.S.  at  873.  It  found  deeply  troubling  ‘‘the  vagueness  inherent  in  the  open- 
ended  term  ‘patently  offensive’ ’’;  such  vagueness,  the  Court  said,  ‘‘raises  special 
First Amendment concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free speech.’’ Id. 
The phrases suggested by the FCC to delimit a class of impermissibly violent con-
tent—‘‘outrageously offensive,’’ ‘‘rough,’’ ‘‘intense,’’ and the like—are no more definite 
than  other  statutory  phrases  deemed  unconstitutionally  vague  by  the  Supreme 
Court,  from  ‘‘patently  offensive’’  and  ‘‘so  massed  as  to  become  vehicles  for  inciting’’ 
in  Reno  v.  ACLU  and  Winters,  respectively,  to  such  phrases  as  ‘‘moral  and  proper’’ 
and ‘‘prejudicial to the best interests of the people.’’ See Interstate Circuit, 930 U.S. 
at 682 (listing impermissibly vague phrases). Because these phrases have no histori-
cally  or  legally  established  meaning,  they  provide  little  guidance  for  those  subject 
to  punitive  measures  for  failing  to  comply  with  the  statute’s  imprecise  commands. 
The vague definitions of impermissible violence proposed by the FCC also pose an-
other  danger:  the  delegation  of  essentially  boundless,  subjective  discretion  to  the 
FCC. Language like ‘‘patently offensive,’’ when divorced from the historical and legal 
contexts  to  which  it  has  traditionally  been  attached,  has  such  a  ‘‘standardless 
sweep’’  that  it  would  impermissibly  allow  the  FCC’s  individual  enforcement  agents 
‘‘to  pursue  their  personal  predilections.’’  Smith,  415  U.S.  at  575.  Indeed,  vague 
standards  could  empower  the  FCC  to  crack  down  on  certain  programs  because  of 
political  pressure,  or  based  on  individual  commissioners’  aesthetic  or  moral  judg-
ments  about  particular  shows  or  particular  scenes.  As  with  a  statute  prohibiting 
‘‘opprobrious words or abusive language,’’ such as the one the Supreme Court invali-
dated  in  Gooding  v.  Wilson,  405  U.S.  518  (1972),  any  attempt  to  regulate  violence 
will be too ‘‘easily susceptible to improper application.’’ Id. at 528; see also Forsythe 
County  v.  Nationalist  Movement,  505  U.S.  123,  133  n.  10  (1992)  (‘‘It  is  not  merely

the  sporadic  abuse  of  power  by  the  censor  but  the  pervasive  threat  inherent  in  its 
very existence that constitutes the danger to freedom of expression.’’). 

The FCC’s conclusion that a definition of impermissible violence can avoid vague-
ness  problems  is  unconvincing  because  it  makes  no  real  effort  to  grapple  with  the 
Supreme Court’s First Amendment vagueness precedents. Ignoring every other case, 
the  Report  does  cite  glancingly  to  a  single  Supreme  Court  opinion  to  suggest  that 
a  sufficiently  clear  definition  of  violence  could  be  developed.  That  decision,  FCC  v. 
Pacifica  Foundation,  438  U.S.  726  (1978),  does  not  support  the  FCC’s  conclusion. 
In Pacifica, the Supreme Court upheld a sanction on a radio station for broadcasting 
‘‘indecent’’  content  despite  an  arguably  vague  definition  of  ‘‘indecent.’’  But  the 
underpinnings of Pacifica have since been eroded, and, in any case, are not transfer-
able to the context of television violence. 

First, as the Supreme Court recognized at the time, 438 U.S. at 750, and has sub-
sequently  reaffirmed,  Pacifica  stands  for  ‘‘an  emphatically  narrow  holding.’’  Sable 
Communication,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  492  U.S.  115,  127  (1989).  That  holding  was  limited 
to  its  facts—a  particular  comic  monologue,  broadcast  on  the  radio,  which  was  per-
vaded  by  words  with  explicit  sexual  meanings.  Indeed,  the  Pacifica  Court  had  no 
occasion to consider—and did not consider—whether any particular definition of ‘‘in-
decency’’ was constitutional, because the respondent had conceded that the program-
ming  was  ‘‘patently  offensive.’’  438  U.S.  at  739;  id.  at  742  (declining  to  decide 
whether  the  Commission’s  general  definition  of  ‘‘indecency’’  was  constitutional  and 
stressing that its review was limited to the particular broadcast before it). 

Second,  the  FCC  Report  ignores  the  Supreme  Court’s  much  more  recent  decision 
in  Reno  v.  ACLU,  mentioned  above,  which  found  impermissibly  vague  the  CDA’s 
ban  on  the  distribution  of  ‘‘indecent’’  material  on  the  Internet  even  though  the 
CDA’s definition of prohibited material was essentially identical to the FCC’s broad-
cast indecency standard. Just this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit  said  that,  in  light  of  the  Reno  v.  ACLU  decision,  ‘‘we  are  skeptical  that  the 
FCC’s  identically  worded  indecency  test  could  nevertheless  provide  the  requisite 
clarity  to  withstand  constitutional  scrutiny.’’  Fox,  supra,  slip  op.  at  31.  Indeed,  the 
Second Circuit continued, ‘‘we are sympathetic to the . . . contention that the FCC’s 
indecency  test  is  undefined,  indiscernible,  inconsistent,  and  consequently,  unconsti-
tutionally vague.’’ Id. at 32. 

Finally,  even  if  Pacifica  would  be  read  as  allowing  a  particular  use  of  a  vague 
definition of ‘‘indecency,’’ its reasoning could not be extended to definitions of ‘‘exces-
sive violence’’ that use the adjective ‘‘indecent’’ or that are modeled on existing defi-
nitions  of  ‘‘indecent.’’  Like  obscenity  law,  indecency  regulation  is  a  constitutional 
anomaly  with  a  distinct  historical  provenance  that  taps  into  traditional  concerns 
with personal modesty and the propriety of open expressions of sexuality—concerns 
that  find  no  analogue  in  depictions  of  violence.  Barnes  v.  Glen  Theatre,  Inc.,  501 
U.S.  560  (1991)  (plurality  opinion)  (citing  common  law  prohibitions  on  public  inde-
cency that predated the First Amendment by more than a century to uphold a pro-
hibition on public nudity). The legal and historical distinctions between ‘‘indecency’’ 
and ‘‘violence’’ lay at the heart of the Winters Court’s recognition that the treatment 
of ‘‘indecent’’ material could not be invoked to sustain a similarly worded definition 
of  impermissible  violence,  which  the  Court  held  ‘‘ha[d]  no  technical  or  common  law 
meaning.’’ 333 U.S. at 518, 519. 

The  conclusion  that  any  meaningful  attempt  to  regulate  violence  on  television 
would  fail  on  vagueness  grounds  does  not  rest  on  mere  conjecture  about  how  the 
lower  courts  would  apply  the  Supreme  Court’s  precedents.  To  the  contrary,  the 
lower  Federal  courts  have  consistently  struck  down  prohibitions  of  displays  of  vio-
lence on vagueness grounds. When Louisiana attempted to regulate any video game 
that  ‘‘appeal[ed]  to  the  minor’s  morbid  interest  in  violence,’’  a  Federal  court  held 
that the language the statute used was too vague because video game makers would 
be ‘‘forced to guess at the meaning and scope of the Statute.’’ Entm’t Software Ass’n 
v. Foti, 451 F. Supp. 2d 823, 836 (M.D. La. 2006). In Entertainment Software Asso-
ciation  v.  Blagojevich,  404  F.  Supp.  2d  1051,  1077  (N.D.  Ill.  2005),  affirmed,  469 
F.3d  641  (8th  Cir.  2006),  a  Federal  district  court  struck  down  that  state’s  violent 
video  game  law  on  the  ground  that  the  statute’s  definition  of  impermissible  vio-
lence—such as depictions of humans inflicting ‘‘serious physical harm’’ on other hu-
mans—was too vague. Id. at 1077. Similar statutes have been struck down in Michi-
gan  (Entm’t  Software  Ass’n  v.  Granholm,  426  F.  Supp.  2d  646  (E.D.  Mich.  2006)), 
Washington  (Video  Software  Dealers  Ass’n  v.  Maleng,  325  F.  Supp.  2d  1180  (W.D. 
Wash.  2004)),  and  Minnesota  Entertainment  Software  Association  v.  Hatch,  443  F. 
Supp.  2d  1065  (D.  Minn.  2006)),  and  have  been  enjoined  in  Oklahoma  Entertain-
ment Software Association v. Henry, 2006 WL 2927884 (W.D. Oklahoma, 2006)), and 
California  (Video  Software  Dealers  Association  v.  Schwarzenegger,  401  F.Supp.  2d 
1034 (N.D. Cal. 2005)).

B.  Any  plausible  definition  of  impermissible  television  violence  will  unconsti-
tutionally discriminate based on the viewpoint expressed. 

34 

Much  of  the  drive  to  regulate  televised  violence  responds  less  to  violence  as  such 
than to what a particular depiction appears to say about the use of violence—wheth-
er it appears to glamorize or condemn such use, whether it seems to approve or dis-
approve of some form or degree of violent behavior in a given context, and what atti-
tude about or perspective on violence viewers might be expected to take away from 
the  experience.  It  is  hardly  a  coincidence,  therefore,  that  definitions  of  ‘‘impermis-
sible’’  depictions  of  violence  often  reveal  explicit  viewpoint  discrimination  of  a  sort 
that  flies  in  the  face  of  core  First  Amendment  precepts:  for  example,  the  FCC  Re-
port  suggests  that  a  definition  of  violence  might  helpfully  include  factors  such  as 
whether  violence  is  ‘‘glamorize[d]’’  or  ‘‘trivialize[d],’’  ‘‘whether  [the  violence]  is  mor-
ally  defensible  or  unjustified,’’  and  ‘‘whether  the  violence  is  explicitly  rewarded  or 
goes  unpunished.’’  FCC  Report  at  20  &  8  n.  34  (citing  factors  identified  in  violence 
study). 

But  any  law,  regulation,  or  enforcement  practice  that  explicitly  or  implicitly  re-
stricted  ‘‘excessively  violent’’  programming  in  this  way,  or  in  any  way  that  consid-
ered the purpose or message behind the use of violence, would necessarily be subject 
to—and  would  almost  certainly  fail—the  strictest  First  Amendment  scrutiny,  as 
landmark  decisions  such  as  RAV.  v.  City  of  St.  Paul,  505  U.S.  377  (1992),  make 
clear. At issue in that case was a local ordinance criminalizing ‘‘fighting words’’ that 
attacked the intended victim’s ‘‘race, color, creed, religion or gender.’’ Id. at 391. The 
Court  acknowledged  that  ‘‘fighting  words,’’  like  obscenity  (but  unlike  depictions  of 
violence), generally receive the lowest level of First Amendment protection. It never-
theless  concluded  that  this  ordinance  violated  the  First  Amendment  because  it  en-
gaged  in  unconstitutional  viewpoint  discrimination:  it  prohibited  racist,  sexist,  and 
anti-religious ‘‘fighting words,’’ but not similar speech ‘‘in favor of racial, color, etc., 
tolerance  and  equality.’’  Id.  ‘‘The  government  may  not  regulate  [speech]  based  on 
hostility—or  favoritism—towards  the  underlying  message  expressed,’’  even  if  that 
speech  as  a  general  matter  receives  less  First  Amendment  protection.  Id.  at  386; 
see  also  Kingsley-International  Pictures  Corp.  v.  Regents  of  the  University  of  the 
State  of  N.Y.,  360  U.S.  684  (1959)  (striking  down  state  law  proscribing  the  display 
of any film depicting adultery as desirable). 

The  same  rationale  would  apply  to  prohibit  any  law  defining  ‘‘impermissibly  vio-
lent’’ programming as programming that expressed or implied approval or tolerance 
of  violence;  that  left  audiences  with  the  sense  that  violence  could  be  engaged  in 
without  anyone  getting  badly  hurt;  or  that  instilled  undue  fear  at  the  thought  of 
being  violently  attacked.  Presumably,  under  such  a  law,  equally  intense,  graphic, 
and  even  vicious  portrayals  of  violence  would  be  permitted,  so  long  as  they  ex-
pressed the view that violence was generally improper, typically injurious and pain-
ful  to  perpetrator  and  victim  alike,  but  not  so  rampant  as  to  be  a  reason  for  night-
marish  fear.  Similarly,  neither  a  Federal  statute  nor  an  enforcement  action  by  the 
FCC  could  constitutionally  punish  violence  employed  for  a  bad  or  evil  purpose—as 
by  a  criminal—while  leaving  unpunished  violence  employed  for  a  good  or  just  pur-
pose—as  by  a  police  officer  or  a  superhero.  To  treat  a  scene  showing  a  criminal 
shooting  a  fleeing  victim  in  the  leg  differently  from  a  scene  depicting  a  policeman 
shooting  a  fleeing  suspect  in  the  leg  would  be  to  engage  in  precisely  this  kind  of 
forbidden  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  viewpoint.  And  if  a  law  drew  a  distinction 
between,  for  example,  real  violence  during  an  actual  boxing  match  (which  it  per-
mitted),  and  fake  violence  during  a  simulated  fight  in  a  television  show  (which  it 
forbade), it would also enforce a particular view about when violence is appropriate. 
Such  discrimination  among  viewpoints  triggers  the  strictest  possible  scrutiny,  and 
under RAV. would almost certainly fail that test. 

C. Any plausible definition of impermissible television violence will be unconsti-
tutionally overbroad. 

An intrinsic problem with defining impermissible violence is that any such defini-
tion that manages to sweep in enough violent content to accomplish Congress’s goals 
will at the same time sweep in far more speech than may permissibly be suppressed. 
Whatever  interests  Congress  may  assert  to  regulate  televised  violence,  they  do  not 
justify prohibiting adults (or, for that matter, older children) from seeing the violent 
but protected depictions that the FCC hopes to prevent young children from seeing. 
Even  a  statute  enacted  with  the  best  of  intentions,  and  even  one  undoubtedly  ef-
fective  in  achieving  its  objectives,  is  ‘‘unconstitutional  on  its  face  if  it  prohibits  a 
substantial  amount  of  protected  expression.’’  Ashcroft  v.  Free  Speech  Coalition,  535 
U.S. 234, 244 (2002). ‘‘[W]hen legitimate legislative concerns are expressed in a stat-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

35 

ute which imposes a substantial burden on protected First Amendment activities,[2] 
Congress  must  achieve  its  goal  by  means  which  have  a  ‘less  drastic’  impact  on  the 
continued vitality of First Amendment freedoms. The Constitution and the basic po-
sition  of  First  Amendment  rights  in  our  democratic  fabric  demand  nothing  less.’’ 
United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 267 (1967). 

It  has  long  been  settled  that  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  limiting  permissible 
expression  to  speech  that  would  be  suitable  for  the  very  young.  In  the  landmark 
case  of  Butler  v.  Michigan,  352  U.S.  380  (1957),  the  Supreme  Court  considered  the 
constitutionality  of  a  Michigan  statute  that  criminalized  distribution  of  books  that 
contained language ‘‘tending to the corruption of the morals of youth.’’ The State of 
Michigan  argued  that,  ‘‘by  thus  quarantining  the  general  reading  public  against 
books  not  too  rugged  for  grown  men  and  women  in  order  to  shield  juvenile  inno-
cence,  it  is  exercising  its  power  to  promote  the  general  welfare.’’  Id.  at  383.  The 
Court  emphatically  rejected  this  argument,  famously  observing:  ‘‘Surely,  this  is  to 
burn  the  house  to  roast  the  pig. . . .  The  incidence  of  this  enactment  is  to  reduce 
the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children.’’ Id. 

Similarly, in Ashcroft, the Supreme Court struck down a statute that would have 
banned  the  display  of  ‘‘ ‘any  visual  depiction,  including  any  photograph,  film,  video, 
picture,  or  computer  or  computer-generated  image  or  picture,’  that  ‘is,  or  appears 
to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.’ ’’ 535 U.S. at 241. This stat-
ute  was  aimed  at  protecting  minors,  both  from  abuse  in  the  making  of  such  depic-
tions and, like the regulations here contemplated by the FCC, from the effects that 
the dissemination of those depictions could have on them. The Court recognized that 
protecting  children  was  vitally  important,  but  observed  that  the  statute  prohibited 
vast quantities of speech that adults had a right to hear, such as several films that 
either won or were nominated for Academy Awards. The Court held that ‘‘[t]he Gov-
ernment  cannot  ban  speech  fit  for  adults  simply  because  it  may  fall  into  the  hands 
of  children.’’  Id.  at  252;  see  also  Reno  v.  ACLU,  521  U.S.  at  877  (striking  down  the 
ban  on  indecent  material  on  the  Internet  because  ‘‘[t]he  general,  undefined  terms 
‘indecent’  and  ‘patently  offensive’  cover  large  amounts  of  nonpornographic  material 
with serious educational or other value’’); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 
U.S. 60, 79 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring) (noting that ban on mailing contracep-
tion  information,  ostensibly  to  protect  children,  is  ‘‘broader  than  is  necessary  be-
cause  it  completely  bans  from  the  mail  unsolicited  materials  that  are  suitable  for 
adults’’). 

Many  of  the  proposed  regulations  of  television  violence  share  the  same  constitu-
tional defect: out of concern for protecting young children, they would prevent adults 
and  older  children  from  viewing  programs  that  they  are  constitutionally  entitled  to 
see. Indeed, as noted above, some of the leading advocates for centralized regulation 
of  television  violence  have  raised  objections  to  an  astonishingly  broad  range  of  con-
tent—extending  well  beyond  actual  depictions  of  even  arguably  objectionable  vio-
lence—that  they  believe  should  be  kept  off  television  (at  least  before  10  p.m.),  in-
cluding  televised  descriptions  of  violent  behavior  (such  as  the  testimony  of  a  victim 
at  a  rape  trial),  mere  intimations  that  violence  has  occurred  (such  as  blood  on  the 
floor),  and  even  depictions  of  medical  procedures.3 Whatever  the  merits  of  restrict-
ing the availability of such content to young children, no similar argument can pos-
sibly justify keeping this content away from adults and older children, as the FCC’s 
proposals threaten to do.4 Congress may not prescribe a regulation of violent speech 
that limits ‘‘the level of discourse reaching [people’s homes] . . . to that which would 
be suitable for a sandbox.’’ Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74. 

D.  Any  plausible  regulation  of  supposedly  unacceptable  television  violence  will 
contain  too  many  internal  inconsistencies  to  meet  First  Amendment  standards. 
The  FCC  has  identified  several  interests  that  are  arguably  served  by  centrally 

regulating televised violence, including: 

• enabling parents to protect their children from material that the parents believe 
• enabling parents to protect their children from material that the parents believe 

will make their children too insensitive to the evils of hurting others, 

will make their children too fearful of being violently injured or killed, and 

2 In  that  case,  the  burden  was  ‘‘bar[ring]  employment  . . .  for  association  which  may  not  be 

proscribed consistently with First Amendment rights.’’ 389 U.S. at 266.

cent of American television homes contain no children under eighteen. Nielsen Television Index,

• protecting children from material their parents would not want them to see but 

are unable to keep from their children despite that wish. 

36 

However  legitimate  or  even  compelling  these  interests  might  be,  they  are  at  war 
with  one  another  to  such  a  degree  that  they  will  ironically  render  any  statute  that 
was  closely  tailored  to  serve  any  one  of  those  interests  self-defeating  with  respect 
to  others,  leaving  it  unconstitutionally  ill-fitting  under  the  First  Amendment.  See 
City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 51 (1994). 

The ostensible interest in protecting children from frightening material, for exam-
ple, would suggest that any depiction of violence should be cartoonish and sanitized, 
as  in  the  madcap  violence  of  the  Roadrunner  cartoons  or  the  Three  Stooges  or  the 
stylized  heroics  of  the  old  Batman  series;  but  this  would  undercut  the  asserted  in-
terests  in  making  children  understand  the  real-life  consequences  of  violence  and  in 
avoiding  material  that  proponents  of  regulation  fear  children  might  imitate.  Fur-
ther,  if  some  obviously  protected  categories  of  violent  depictions,  such  as  those  in 
news or sports, were exempted in order to save regulation of television violence from 
unimaginable  overbreadth,  the  result  would  be  to  prevent  Congress’s  goals  from 
being  meaningfully  served:  children  who  would  imitate  the  physical  brawling  on  a 
detective  drama  would  be  no  less  likely  to  imitate  the  hard-hitting  tackles  on  tele-
vised  football  games,  assuming  the  risk  of  imitative  behavior  to  be  as  the  pro-
ponents  suggest  it  is.  And  if  the  fictional  bloodletting  on  ‘‘The  Shield’’  scares  young 
children,  then  surely  the  very  real  violence  that  children  might  see  while  watching 
news about the war in Iraq would be no less frightening. The First Amendment for-
bids  speech  regulation  that  selectively  targets  some  speech  while  exempting  other 
speech  that  is  likely  to  have  similar  effects.  See  Rubin  v.  Coors  Brewing  Co.,  514 
U.S.  476,  487–89  (1995);  City  of  Cincinnati  v.  Discovery  Networks,  Inc.,  507  U.S. 
410,  427  (1993);  Edenfield  v.  Fane,  507  U.S.  761,  773  (1993);  Fox,  supra,  slip  op. 
at 24 (noting that ability of children to hear fleeting expletives in contexts expressly 
permitted  by  the  FCC  such  as  news  programs  and  a  movie  like  ‘‘Saving  Private 
Ryan’’ undermined the FCC’s rationale that hearing such fleeting expletives was in-
herently damaging to children). 
III.  Even  Ignoring  These  Core  Definitional  Defects,  the  FCC’s  Proposals 

Cannot Be Reconciled With the First Amendment 

As a result of these characteristics, all of the options presented in the report clear-
ly  flunk  even  the  ‘‘intermediate’’  scrutiny  test  that  governs  content-neutral  regula-
tions  of  speech.5 But  the  FCC’s  proposed  regulations  of  television  violence  suffer 
from  constitutional  infirmities  beyond  the  definitional  flaws  I  have  already  de-
scribed.  Because  each  of  the  proposals  imposes  content-based  restrictions  on  pro-
tected speech, all are subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment. And all 
three proposals fail such strict scrutiny. 

A. Strict scrutiny applies to the FCC’s specific proposals to regulate violent tele-
vision programming. 

Government  regulation  of  expression  based  on  its  content  is  generally  subject  to 
strict scrutiny, the most exacting First Amendment standard of review. RAV. v. City 
of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992). Such regulations are ‘‘presumptively invalid,’’ 
id.  at  382,  and  are  void  unless  ‘‘narrowly  tailored  to  promote  a  compelling  govern-
ment  interest’’  in  the  strong  sense  that,  ‘‘[i]f  a  less  restrictive  alternative  would 
serve  the  Government’s  purpose,  the  legislature  must  use  the  alternative.’’  United 
States v. Playboy Entm’t Group, 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000) (emphasis added). 

The FCC Report acknowledges that strict scrutiny normally applies to any regula-
tion  of  expressive  content.  FCC  Report  at  11.  We  will  shortly  see  specifically  why 
each  of  the  FCC’s  proposals  would  burden  free  speech  in  a  way  that  triggers  strict 
scrutiny. Before that analysis, however, I turn to three arguments that the FCC Re-
port  makes  for  its  view  that  strict  scrutiny  is,  as  a  general  matter,  inapplicable  to 
almost  any  child-protective  regulation  of  ‘‘violent  content’’  on  television.  First,  the 
FCC argues that strict scrutiny would not apply because ‘‘violence’’ (or some subset 
thereof) is analogous to ‘‘indecency’’ and ‘‘obscenity,’’ regulation of which it contends 
is subject to a lower level of scrutiny. FCC Report at 12. Second, the FCC suggests 
that  strict  scrutiny  may  not  apply  when  a  legislature  limits  expression  to  protect 

5 Even  content-neutral  restrictions  on  speech  as  such  are  constitutionally  required  to  be  nar-
rowly tailored to serve the government’s significant interests. See Sable Communications of Cal., 
Inc.  v.  FCC,  492  U.S.  115,  126  (1989);  Clark  v.  Community  for  Creative  Non-Violence,  468  U.S. 
288, 293 (1984). And ‘‘[a] statute is narrowly tailored [only] if it targets and eliminates no more 
than  the  exact  source  of  the  ‘evil’  it  seeks  to  remedy,’’  Frisby  v.  Schultz,  487  U.S.  474,  485 
(1988),  not  if  it  is  ‘‘substantially  broader  than  necessary  to  achieve  the  government’s  interest.’’ 
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 800 (1989).

children.  FCC  Report  at  12.  Finally,  the  FCC  argues  that  strict  scrutiny  ‘‘does  not 
apply to the regulation of broadcast speech.’’ FCC Report at 11. None of these claims 
has merit. 

1.  Any  analogy  between  ‘‘violence’’  and  ‘‘indecency’’  or  ‘‘obscenity’’  cannot 
support  evaluating  the  FCC’s  proposals  under  anything  less  than  strict  scru-
tiny. 

Although  acknowledging  that  depictions  of  violence  generally  are  subject  to  strict 
scrutiny, the FCC Report contends that a subset of violent depictions—such as ‘‘ex-
cessively violent programming’’—could be regulated under a lower standard of scru-
tiny because it is analogous to ‘‘indecency’’ or ‘‘obscenity.’’ 

First,  the  FCC  Report  argues  that  depictions  of  violence  may  be  deemed  ‘‘exces-
sive’’  if  they  are  ‘‘patently  offensive’’  in  the  same  way  that  indecent  programming 
is. So defined, the Report contends, ‘‘excessively violent programming, like indecent 
programming,  occupies  a  relatively  low  position  in  the  hierarchy  of  First  Amend-
ment  values  because  it  is  of  ‘slight  social  value  as  a  step  to  truth.’ ’’  FCC  Report 
at  12.  But  even  assuming  that  ‘‘excessively  violent’’  programming  could  be  analo-
gized  to  ‘‘indecent’’  programming,  the  FCC’s  argument  would  rest  on  a  fundamen-
tally  flawed  premise:  namely,  that  regulations  of  ‘‘indecent’’  programming  can  be 
evaluated under a standard more forgiving than strict scrutiny. The FCC’s sole sup-
port  for  this  premise  is  FCC  v.  Pacifica  Foundation,  438  U.S.  726  (1978),  in  which 
a  three-justice  plurality  of  the  Supreme  Court  appeared  to  apply  a  standard  other 
than  strict  scrutiny  to  the  FCC’s  sanction  of  an  indecent  radio  broadcast.  But 
Pacifica  is  no  longer  good  law  on  this  point,  and  the  FCC  inexplicably  ignores  the 
Supreme  Court’s  subsequent  pronouncements  about  the  level  of  scrutiny  that  ap-
plies  to  regulation  of  indecent  content.  For  example,  in  Sable  Communications  v. 
FCC,  492  U.S.  115  (1989),  the  Supreme  Court  unanimously  applied  strict  scrutiny 
to  evaluate  the  constitutionality  of  a  prohibition  on  indecent  dial-a-porn  messages. 
Id. at 126. And in United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803 
(2000), the Supreme Court unanimously applied strict scrutiny to evaluate the con-
stitutionality  of  a  time  channeling  requirement  for  cable  television  operators  who 
primarily  carried  ‘‘sexually-oriented  programming.’’  Id.  at  813;  see  also  id.  at  831 
(Scalia,  J.,  dissenting)  (applying  strict  scrutiny  but  finding  that  the  test  was  satis-
fied);  Id.  at  836  (Breyer,  J.,  dissenting)  (same).  Thus,  the  FCC’s  analogy  between 
violent and indecent programming does not justify the application of a lower stand-
ard of scrutiny. 

Second,  the  FCC  Report  seems  to  suggest  that  a  lower  standard  of  scrutiny  ap-
plies  to  regulations  of  violent  television  because  depictions  of  violence  are  directly 
analogous to obscenity. FCC Report at 11 n. 56. The Supreme Court has recognized 
obscenity  as  one  of  the  ‘‘few  limited  areas’’  of  essentially  ‘‘unprotected’’  speech  in 
which  it  ‘‘has  permitted  restrictions  upon  the  content  of  speech’’  without  requiring 
application  of  strict  scrutiny.  RAV,  505  U.S.  at  382–83.  But  any  superficial  simi-
larity  between  obscenity  and  ‘‘excessive’’  violence  does  not  lessen  the  First  Amend-
ment  protection  to  which  restrictions  of  violent  television  programming  are  subject. 
As an initial matter, the violent character of something depicted on television, no 
matter  how  extreme,  does  not  in  itself  render  the  depiction  ‘‘obscene,’’  as  that  term 
has  long  been  understood  in  the  First  Amendment  context,  because  the  Supreme 
Court  has  clearly  ‘‘confine[d]  the  permissible  scope  of  . . .  regulation  [of  obscenity] 
to works which depict or describe sexual conduct.’’ Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 
24 (1973); see also Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 213 n. 10 (1975) 
(‘‘[T]o  be  obscene  ‘such  expression  must  be,  in  some  significant  way,  erotic.’ ’’) 
(quoting  Cohen  v.  California,  403  U.S.  15,  20  (1971));  Roth  v.  United  States,  354 
U.S. 476, 487 (1957) (‘‘Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a man-
ner appealing to prurient interest.’’). 

Nor is the notion that certain depictions of violence may in some unspecified sense 
be  like  obscenity  sufficient  to  justify  applying  a  lower  standard  of  review  to  tele-
vision  violence.  Testing  that  proposition,  certain  opponents  of  violent  programming 
have  suggested  adapting  the  definition  of  obscenity  from  Miller  v.  California  to 
cover  television  violence,  so  that  programming  would  be  deemed  ‘‘excessively  vio-

Video Software Dealers Ass’n v. Webster, 968 F.2d 684, 687 (8th Cir. 1992). In my 
view,  the  Supreme  Court  would  have  to  apply  strict  scrutiny  to  regulations  based 
upon  any  such  ‘‘definition  by  substitution.’’  To  be  sure,  the  definition  is  ‘‘derived’’ 
from  obscenity  in  the  mechanical  sense  that  it  simply  substitutes  the  word  ‘‘vio-
lence’’ for the word ‘‘sex.’’ But one could as easily replace ‘‘sex’’ in the Miller defini-
tion  with  such  words  as  ‘‘suffering,’’  ‘‘tragedy,’’  ‘‘death,’’  ‘‘disability’’—or,  for  that 
matter,  ‘‘genius,’’  ‘‘comedy,’’  or  even  ‘‘life.’’  Analytically,  each  resulting  derivative  of 
the  Miller  test  would  be  every  bit  as  close  an  analogue  to  obscenity  as  is  the  sug-
gested definition of ‘‘excessive violence,’’ but these simple substitutions could not for 
that  reason  alone  delineate  categories  of  speech  that  enjoy  reduced  First  Amend-
ment protection. The government could not, for example, obtain less stringent First 
Amendment  review  by  regulating  speech  that  ‘‘appeals  to  morbid  interests  in  com-
edy’’ or that ‘‘depicts genius in a way which is patently offensive to the average per-
son.’’ 

This  definition-by-substitution  approach  is  also  inconsistent  with  the  First 
Amendment. The Supreme Court has adopted an extremely strict and carefully ‘‘lim-
ited categorical approach’’ to defining the classes of less-protected speech. RAV, 505 
U.S.  at  383.  ‘‘The  Supreme  Court  historically  has  confined  the  categories  of  unpro-
tected speech to defamation, fighting words, direct incitement of lawless action, and 
obscenity,’’  Eclipse  Enters.,  Inc.  v.  Gulotta,  134  F.3d  63,  66  (2d  Cir.  1997),  and  it 
has refused to create or ‘‘find’’ additional categories that receive something less than 
strict  scrutiny.  The  lower  courts,  accordingly,  have  uniformly  applied  First  Amend-
ment  strict  scrutiny  to  laws  defining  impermissible  depictions  of  violence  based 
upon  Miller’s  definition  of  obscenity.  See,  e.g.,  Eclipse,  134  F.3d  at  64  (‘‘patently  of-
fensive’’  content  lacking  ‘‘serious  literary,  artistic,  political  and  scientific  value’’); 
Webster,  968  F.2d  at  684  (‘‘patently  offensive’’  content  lacking  ‘‘serious  literary,  ar-
tistic, political and scientific value’’). 

This  carefully  limited  approach  reflects  the  well-founded  fear  that  a  looser  view 
of  these  less-protected  categories—one  fastening  on  such  adjectives  as  ‘‘morbid,’’ 
‘‘patently offensive,’’ and absence of ‘‘serious . . . value,’’ and ignoring the operative 
nouns of ‘‘defamation,’’ ‘‘fighting words,’’ ‘‘incitement,’’ and ‘‘obscenity’’—could sharp-
ly and unjustifiably delimit the scope of free speech. Opponents of television violence 
seek  to  analogize  certain  ‘‘excessive’’  depictions  of  violence  to  obscenity  in  part  be-
cause they believe that such violence is no less psychologically harmful than obscen-
ity,  especially  to  young  children.  But  such  generic  and  decontextualized  reasoning 
potentially  opens  the  door  to  regulations  of  many  other  types  of  speech  that  people 
may  think  is  psychologically  harmful,  from  caricature,  to  blasphemy,  to  flag  burn-
ing,  Texas  v.  Johnson,  491  U.S.  397  (1989),  to  rude  political  speech,  Cohen  v.  Cali-
fornia, 403 U.S. 15 (1971) (‘‘F--- the Draft’’), to disrespectful remarks about parents 
and  other  authority  figures,  Watts  v.  United  States,  394  U.S.  705,  706  (1969)  (per 
curiam) (‘‘If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights 
is L.B.J.’’). These examples of fully protected speech, like certain instances of ‘‘exces-
sive’’ violence, may bear some superficial similarities to obscenity: they may disgust 
certain  people,  violate  some  community  standards  of  propriety,  and  appeal  to  what 
some people deem base, immoral, or unseemly instincts. But if the First Amendment 
is  to  remain  a  robust  protection  of  free  speech—and  if  obscenity,  incitement,  and 
the like are to remain the exceptions, rather than the norm—these arguable similar-
ities  cannot  justify  lowering  the  level  of  First  Amendment  protection  enjoyed  by 
such expression. 

Finally,  it  might  be  argued  that  watching  violent,  terrifying,  or  other  extreme 
events can excite some people physically in a way that resembles reflexive reactions 
to sexual material. But that proves far too much. Athletic contests, religious rituals, 
political rallies, and certain kinds of music are all famously capable of exciting pas-
sionate and even physically aggressive visceral responses—including responses that 
many  might  deem  negative  or  even  patently  offensive.  Freedom  of  speech  would  be 
in  grave  jeopardy  if  the  presence  of  a  subliminal  or  physiological  component  in  a 
communication’s  range  of  psychological  effects  could  strip  it  of  constitutionally  pro-
tected status. 

2. Strict scrutiny applies to regulations intended to protect minors. 

The  FCC  Report  suggests  that  a  lower  standard  of  review  applies  to  regulations 
of  speech  that  are  motivated  by  an  attempt  to  protect  children.  FCC  Report  at  3. 
This argument relies upon Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), in which the 
Supreme Court upheld a state law prohibiting the sale of sexually indecent (but not 
obscene) materials to minors. But Ginsberg does not stand for the general rule that 
something  less  than  strict  scrutiny  applies  to  laws  seeking  to  protect  minors  by  re-
placing parental control of the influences to which growing children are subject with 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

39 

central  governmental  control  of  those  influences.6 Rather,  Ginsberg  holding  rested 
on a notion of ‘‘variable obscenity’’ that allowed the definition of obscenity to be ad-
justed  for  different  target  audiences,  so  that  material  merely  indecent  for  adults 
could be deemed obscene for minors. 390 U.S. at 638; cf. Ginzburg, 383 U.S. at 472– 
73  (noting  that  material  can  be  obscene  when  marketed  to  certain  audiences  but 
non-obscene  otherwise).  As  explained  above,  however,  the  logic  that  relativized  the 
definition  of  obscene  material  in  terms  of  the  audience  to  which  such  material  is 
directed  has  no  logical  analogue  in  the  realm  of  violent  but  non-obscene  depictions. 
Apart from the illogic of extrapolating notions of ‘‘variable obscenity’’ to the realm 
of  violent  depictions,  the  idea  that  children’s  special  malleability  counts  in  favor  of 
government control turns the First Amendment on its head. The Supreme Court has 
recognized the powerful and (as some people believe) detrimental influence that the 
government  can  exert  on  young  minds  with  such  control,  in  several  decisions  deny-
ing  the  government  the  power  to  shape  the  education  of  children  as  it  saw  fit.  For 
example,  in  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,  406  U.S.  205,  211  (1972),  the  Court  held  that  the 
state could not compel Amish adolescents to attend public or private schools because 
the  Amish  faith  of  their  parents  taught  that  immersion  in  a  school’s  regimen  to-
gether with non-Amish of similar age would expose the Amish adolescents to values 
‘‘in  marked  variance  with  Amish  values  and  the  Amish  way  of  life.’’  Similarly,  in 
Meyer  v.  Nebraska,  262  U.S.  390,  402  (1923),  the  Court  struck  down  a  law  prohib-
iting  parents  from  engaging  educators  to  teach  foreign  languages  to  their  children, 
comparing  that  law  unfavorably  to  the  Spartan  practice  of  housing  young  boys  in 
military barracks ‘‘[i]n order to submerge the individual and develop ideal citizens.’’ 
Centralized  control  over  the  materials  available  to  children  may  well  flout  not  only 
the  wishes  of  those  children  but  also  of  their  parents,  who  may  have  very  different 
ideas  about  the  kinds  and  levels  of  violence  that  are  appropriate  for  their  children 
to  view.  Indeed,  some  children  and  parents  may  be  convinced  that  it  is  valuable  to 
allow their children to observe the very depictions of violence from which other par-
ents might wish to protect theirs, believing that ‘‘[t]o shield children right up to the 
age  of  18  from  exposure  to  [such]  violent  descriptions  and  images  would  . . .  [be] 
deforming;  it  would  leave  them  unequipped  to  deal  with  the  world  as  we  know  it.’’ 
Kendrick, 244 F.3d at 577. 

Finally,  just  as  children  have  a  First  Amendment  right  to  see  violent  television 
programming  that  government,  but  not  their  parents,  wish  them  not  to  see,  so 
broadcasters,  cable/satellite  operators,  artists,  and  other  content  providers  have  a 
right  to  furnish  that  programming.  ‘‘[T]he  government  cannot  silence  protected 
speech by wrapping itself in the cloak of parental authority.’’ IDSA, 329 F.3d at 960. 
I do not mean to suggest that parents have no legitimate concerns about allowing 
their children to see violence on television. My point is simply that centralized gov-
ernment regulation of television content is not the constitutionally appropriate way 
to  respond  to  such  concerns.  Under  the  First  Amendment,  regulation  of  this  sort 
does  not  receive  a  free  pass  simply  because  it  is  motivated  by,  concerned  with,  or 
addressed  to  children.  Rather,  any  such  regulation  must  be  evaluated  under  the 
same standard that applies to all restrictions on speech: strict scrutiny. 

3. Strict scrutiny applies to regulations of broadcast television content. 

The FCC Report contends that strict scrutiny would be inapplicable to regulation 
of  the  ‘‘violent  content’’  of  broadcast  television  programming.  FCC  Report  at  11.  To 
support  that  proposition,  the  FCC  cites  two  justifications:  (i)  broadcasting’s  sup-
posed  ‘‘uniquely  pervasive  presence  in  the  lives  of  all  Americans,’’  and  (ii) 
broadcasting’s supposed ‘‘accessibility to children, coupled with the government’s in-
terests  in  the  well-being  of  children  and  in  supporting  parental  supervision  of  chil-
dren.’’  FCC  Report  at  11  (internal  quotations  omitted).  For  these  reasons,  the  FCC 
argues,  broadcasting  traditionally  has  been  afforded  a  lower  level  of  First  Amend-
ment  protection  than  other  means  of  communication  (such  as  cable),  purportedly 
giving the government greater leeway to impose content-based regulations. FCC Re-
port at 11. 

Unfortunately,  the  FCC  is  caught  in  a  time  warp.  The  justifications  for  allowing 
government  regulation  of  content  on  broadcast  television  date  back  several  decades 
to the Supreme Court’s decisions in Red Lion v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), and FCC 
v.  Pacifica  Foundation,  438  U.S.  726  (1978).  In  Red  Lion,  the  Court  observed  that 
‘‘if  there  is  to  be  any  effective  communication  by  radio,  only  a  few  can  be  licensed 
and  the  rest  must  be  barred  from  the  airwaves.’’  395  U.S.  at  389.  ‘‘Because  of  the 

6 On  the  contrary,  as  we  will  see  shortly,  the  Court  has  generally  applied  strict  scrutiny  to 
laws  that  might  interfere  with  the  ability  of  parents  themselves  ‘‘to  make  decisions  concerning 
the  care,  custody,  and  control  of  their  [own]  children.’’  Troxel  v.  Granville,  530  U.S.  57,  66 
(2000).

scarcity  of  radio  frequencies,  the  Government  is  permitted  to  put  restraints  on  li-
censees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on this unique medium.’’ 
Id.  390.  In  Pacifica,  the  Court  upheld  an  after-the-fact  fine  for  the  airing  of  ‘‘seven 
dirty words’’ in the course of a comedy monologue broadcast over the radio. In that 
case,  the  Court  took  note  of  the  listener’s  privacy  interests  in  controlling  what  he 
hears in his own home or car and concluded that, ‘‘[b]ecause the broadcast audience 
is  constantly  tuning  in  and  out,  prior  warnings  cannot  completely  protect  the  lis-
tener  or  viewer  from  unexpected  program  content’’  on  broadcast  radio.  438  U.S.  at 
748. 

In my view, however, broadcast television can no longer be considered the unloved 
stepchild  of  the  First  Amendment—to  the  extent  that  its  subordinate  status  was 
ever  justified  to  begin  with.  This  is  true  for  two  reasons.  First,  technological  ad-
vances  have  made  broadcast  television  more  similar  to  other  media  such  as  cable, 
content-based  regulation  of  which  is  indisputably  subject  to  strict  scrutiny.  See  Co-
lumbia  Broadcasting  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  Democratic  Nat’l  Comm.,  412  U.S.  94,  102  (1973) 
(‘‘[T]he  broadcast  industry  is  dynamic  in  terms  of  technological  change;  solutions 
adequate  a  decade  ago  are  not  necessarily  so  now,  and  those  acceptable  today  may 
well  be  outmoded  10  years  hence.’’).  Second,  to  the  degree  that  broadcast  television 
retains  features  distinct  from  other  television  media,  these  distinctions  cannot  jus-
tify  the  kinds  of  content-based  regulation  of  speech  that  the  FCC  Report  proposes. 
Cf.  Turner  Broadcasting  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  512  U.S.  622,  639  (1994)  (‘‘[W]hatever 
relevance  these  physical  characteristics  may  have  in  the  evaluation  of  particular 
cable regulations, they do not require the alteration of settled principles of our First 
Amendment jurisprudence.’’). 

The  Supreme  Court’s  post-Red  Lion  case  law  on  this  subject,  while  paying  lip 
service to the anomalous place of broadcast in First Amendment jurisprudence, has 
increasingly recognized that broadcast media have grown ever more similar to other 
media,  such  as  cable,  that  enjoy  undiluted  First  Amendment  protection.  The  Su-
preme  Court  first  began  to  dismantle  the  foundations  of  broadcast  media’s  subordi-
nate First Amendment status as early as 1984, in FCC v. League of Women Voters, 
468  U.S.  364  (1984),  which  struck  down  an  act  of  Congress  forbidding  federally 
funded,  noncommercial  broadcast  stations  from  engaging  in  editorializing.  The 
Court  assumed  that,  under  Red  Lion,  the  unique  features  of  broadcast  media  ‘‘re-
quired  some  adjustment  in  First  Amendment  analysis.’’  Id.  at  377.  But  in  invali-
dating  the  Federal  statute,  the  Court  applied  a  standard  strikingly  similar  to  the 
normal  strict  scrutiny  test  that  applies  to  most  regulations  of  speech:  it  held  that 
Congress’s  restriction  of  federally  funded  broadcast  media  must  be  ‘‘narrowly  tai-
lored to further a substantial governmental interest,’’ id. at 380, and that Congress 
could  not  burden  free  speech  when  its  ‘‘interest[s]  can  be  fully  satisfied  by  less  re-
strictive means that are readily available,’’ Id. at 395. 

The next significant erosion in the subordinate status of broadcast media occurred 
when  the  Supreme  Court  seriously  examined  the  First  Amendment  implications  of 
cable  television  in  Denver  Area  Telecommunications  Consortium  v.  FCC,  518  U.S. 
727  (1996).  A  four-justice  plurality  noted  that  ‘‘cable  and  broadcast  television  differ 
little, if at all,’’ id. at 748, because ‘‘cable television . . . is as accessible to children 
as over-the-air broadcasting, if not more so,’’ and because, like broadcast television, 
‘‘[c]able  television  systems  . . .  have  established  a  uniquely  pervasive  presence  in 
the lives of all Americans,’’ id. at 744–45. (The U.S. court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit recently reached the same conclusion, noting that ‘‘it is increasingly difficult 
to  describe  the  broadcast  media  as  uniquely  pervasive  and  uniquely  accessible  to 
children.’’ Fox, supra, slip op. at 36.) Of course, these two factors had been cited by 
Pacifica  to  justify  the  Court’s  application  of  a  lower  standard  of  review  to  regula-
tions  of  broadcast  media.  Nevertheless,  when  the  Court  again  considered  the  con-
stitutionality  of  cable  regulations  in  Playboy,  it  did  not  hold  that  cable  media  en-
joyed  less  First  Amendment  protection  even  though,  like  broadcasting,  it  had  be-
come  pervasive  nationally  and  accessible  to  children.  529  U.S.  at  813–14,  826–27. 
Rather,  the  Court  insisted  that  strict  scrutiny  must  apply  to  content-based  restric-
tion of expression on cable television, thus implicitly calling into question the contin-
ued validity of Pacifica rationales for subordinating broadcast media under the First 
Amendment. 

This  growing  doctrinal  merger  between  broadcast  and  non-broadcast  media  in 
First Amendment jurisprudence properly recognizes the outdated nature of the tech-
nological  assumptions  that  initially  undergirded  the  ‘‘broadcast  exception.’’  For  in-
stance,  the  Pacifica  Court  found  that  broadcast  radio  was  ‘‘uniquely  accessible  to 
children’’  in  an  era  where  voluntary  blocking  technologies  such  as  the  V-Chip  did 
not  exist;  hence,  in  Playboy,  the  Supreme  Court  applied  strict  scrutiny  to  regula-
tions of cable television largely in reliance on the ‘‘key difference’’ that only ‘‘[c]able 
systems  had  the  capacity  to  block  unwanted  channels  on  a  household-by-household 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

41 

basis.’’  529  U.S.  at  815.  Today,  however,  this  distinction  has  dissipated,  as  more 
households  access  broadcast  channels  through  their  cable  or  satellite  systems,  and 
as  more  technology  becomes  available  to  block  programs  on  broadcast  as  well  as 
non-broadcast  television,  as  the  FCC  Report  implicitly  acknowledges.  Fox,  supra, 
slip  op.  at  38  (‘‘If  the  Playboy  decision  is  any  guide,  technological  advances  [such 
as  the  V-Chip]  may  obviate  the  constitutional  legitimacy  of  the  FCC’s  robust  over-
sight.’’). 

Another  technological  justification  noted  above  for  applying  a  lower  level  of  scru-
tiny to broadcast regulations has been spectrum scarcity. See Red Lion v. FCC, 395 
U.S.  367  (1969);  Turner,  512  U.S.  at  637  (referring  to  ‘‘the  unique  physical  limita-
tions  of  the  broadcast  medium’’).  The  limited  number  of  frequencies  available  for 
over-the-air broadcasts has traditionally been cited as a basis for government regu-
lation of broadcasting to prevent signal interference (when two broadcasters use the 
same frequency) and to ensure a sufficiently broad range of voices on the airwaves. 
Id. at 638. 

But  technological  changes  have  greatly  eroded  this  argument  as  well.  Broad-
casters  can  now  use  ever  narrower  bands  of  the  spectrum,  vastly  increasing  the 
number of channels that can be transmitted over the air without signal interference. 
Moreover,  the  expansion  and  increasing  availability  of  alternative  forms  of  commu-
nication,  such  as  cable  and  the  Internet,  have  vitiated  any  asserted  government 
need  to  regulate  the  content  of  broadcasting  to  promote  a  diversity  of  communica-
tions.  Cf.  League  of  Women  Voters,  468  U.S.  at  376  (twenty  years  ago,  acknowl-
edging  ‘‘[c]ritics  [who]  charge  that  with  the  advent  of  cable  and  satellite  television 
technology, communities now have access to such a wide variety of stations that the 
scarcity doctrine is obsolete’’). As formerly distinct media converge, any basis for dis-
tinguishing among television, newspapers, and the Internet dissolves: any of us can 
read  the  Wall  Street  Journal  in  paper  or  on  the  Internet,  and  those  who  miss  epi-
sodes of Ugly Betty or Grey’s Anatomy can watch the shows in their entirety through 
ABC’s website. See Fox, supra, slip op. at 38 (‘‘The proliferation of satellite and cable 
television  channels—not  to  mention  Internet-based  video  outlets—has  begun  to 
erode the ‘uniqueness’ of broadcast media.’’). 

Moreover,  assertions  about  spectrum  scarcity  beg  the  question  as  to  whether  any 
particular  content-based  regulation  can  be  justified.  Even  at  the  time,  the  Court’s 
scarcity  rationale  in  Red  Lion  at  most  was  held  to  justify  regulation  to  ‘‘increas[e] 
the  diversity  of  speakers  and  speech’’;  it  never  ‘‘justif[ied]  censorship’’  of  the  type 
being  proposed  by  the  FCC  with  regard  to  violent  television  programming.  See 
Pacifica,  438  U.S.  at  770  n.  4  (Brennan,  J.,  dissenting);  see  also  League  of  Women 
Voters, 468 U.S. at 379 (characterizing Red Lion as allowing the government to ad-
vance  its  interest  ‘‘in  ensuring  balanced  presentations  of  views  in  this  limited  me-
dium  and  yet  pos[ing]  no  threat  that  a  broadcaster  would  be  denied  permission  to 
carry  a  particular  program  or  to  publish  his  own  views’’).  Indeed,  the  majority  in 
Pacifica  did  not  rely  at  all  on  notions  of  spectrum  scarcity.  Whatever  the  validity 
of  the  technological  distinctions  historically  drawn  between  broadcast  and  non- 
broadcast media, the FCC cannot cite these distinctions to support the kinds of con-
tent-based,  speech-limiting  regulations  that  it  proposes  as  a  response  to  television 
violence. 

The  Supreme  Court’s  post-Red  Lion  and  Pacifica  case  law  thus  reflect  its  aware-
ness  that  the  historically  anomalous  First  Amendment  treatment  of  broadcast 
media  has  become  ever  less  justified  over  time,  evaporating  any  basis  for  with-
holding strict scrutiny from content regulation of broadcast television programming. 
B.  Under  strict  scrutiny,  the  FCC’s  proposals  share  a  common  flaw:  they  are 
not the least restrictive means to satisfy the government’s interests. 

The government is strictly limited in the tools with which it may regulate speech. 
Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 208 (1975). Assuming that the goal 
of limiting children’s access to violent television programming is a compelling inter-
est, regulation of speech to achieve that goal is ‘‘unacceptable if less restrictive alter-
natives  would  be  at  least  as  effective  in  achieving  the  legitimate  purpose  that  the 
statute  was  enacted  to  serve.’’  Reno  v.  ACLU,  521  U.S.  at  874;  see  also  Sable 
Commc’ns, 492 U.S. at 126 (‘‘The Government may . . . regulate the content of con-
stitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest if it chooses 
the  least  restrictive  means  to  further  the  articulated  interest.’’).  The  ‘‘least  restric-
tive  means’’  test  ‘‘is  the  most  demanding  test  known  to  constitutional  law.’’  City  of 
Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 533 (1997). 

Here,  a  large  number  of  less  restrictive  alternatives  exist  to  control  the  avail-
ability  of  violent  television  programming  to  children.  Crucially,  all  of  these  alter-
natives  avoid  the  problems  posed  by  the  FCC’s  proposals  by  empowering  parents 
rather  than  government  to  control  what  children  see,  thus  fitting  far  more  com-

fortably within the framework that the First Amendment establishes as the baseline 
for  reconciling  a  system  of  free  expression  with  the  threats  that  some  forms  of 
speech might pose to some children. The FCC criticizes only a small subset of these 
alternatives, but its criticisms—aside from being too narrowly focused—are both le-
gally immaterial and factually inaccurate. 

1.  Many  less  restrictive  alternatives  exist  to  respond  to  violent  television 

programming. 

The  FCC  Report  surveys  only  a  small  fraction  of  the  options  available,  limiting 
its discussion of current technologies to the V-Chip and cable operator-provided pa-
rental  controls,  coupled  with  voluntary  ratings  systems.  But  the  FCC  substantially 
underreports the extent to which existing technologies can give effect to the govern-
ment’s goal of limiting the exposure of children to television programming that their 
parents  deem  unacceptably  violent.  Parents  have  access  to  a  wide  range  of  tools— 
shortchanged  or  ignored  by  the  FCC  Report—with  which  they  can  limit  their  chil-
dren’s  exposure  to  such  programming  should  they  wish  to  do  so.  As  Commissioner 
McDowell  notes  in  his  separate  statement,  ‘‘Never  have  parents  been  more  empow-
ered  to  choose  what  their  children  should  and  should  not  watch.’’  FCC  Report  at 
37. 

First,  V-Chips  are  available  in  all  but  the  smallest  TVs  (that  is,  all  TVs  bigger 
than  a  piece  of  legal  paper  or  a  laptop  computer)  manufactured  since  2000.7 The 
upcoming  transition  to  digital  television,  scheduled  to  take  place  shortly  after  the 
next Presidential election, will make V-Chip technology universal.8 

Second,  V-Chip-like  devices  are  also  available  on  nearly  all  cable  and  satellite 
services,  allowing  parents  to  block  either  entire  channels  or  just  those  shows  that 
the  parents  believe  include  unacceptably  violent  (or  otherwise  objectionable)  con-
tent.9 Furthermore,  on-screen  guides  are  standard  features  of  most  cable  and  sat-
ellite services, and almost all cable and satellite providers allow viewers to establish 
special menus tailored to their own preferences so as to block channels they do not 
want  their  children  to  watch.  Two  examples  are  Locks  &  Limits  on  DIRECTV  and 
Adult  Guard  on  DISH  Network,  which  Commissioner  Adelstein  mentioned  in  his 
statement accompanying the FCC Report. These parental controls are readily avail-
able  to  the  87.7  percent  of  American  households  that  currently  subscribe  to  cable 
or satellite services.10 

Third,  Parents  can  choose  to  subscribe  to  family-friendly  cable  and  satellite  op-
tions,  such  as  Comcast’s  Children  and  Family  channels,  DISH  Network’s  Family 
Pak,  and  DIRECTV’s  Family  Choice  Plan,  which  enable  individual  households  to 
limit their children to child-friendly content. 

7 As the FCC acknowledged in its report, under a 1996 amendment to Title III of the Commu-
nications  Act,  all  televisions  sets  manufactured  in  the  United  States  or  shipped  in  interstate 
commerce  with  a  screen  larger  than  13  inches  must  be  equipped  with  a  ‘‘V-Chip’’  that  can  be 
programmed  to  block  programming  that  parents  do  not  want  their  children  to  view.  Even  if  it 
is correct that only half of televisions in use are equipped with V-Chips, FCC Report at 13, that 
is  irrelevant  in  light  of  the  fact  that  100  percent  of  new  televisions  available  for  purchase  are 
equipped  with  V-Chips.  And  while  it  is  up  to  individual  parents  to  decide  whether  to  use  it, 
information  on  using  the  V-Chip  is  readily  available.  The  FCC  itself  has  posted  a  website  that 
gives detailed instruction to parents on how to use the V-Chip, and industry and private groups 
have provided similar information via websites and tutorials. See Adam Thierer, The Right Way 
to  Regulate  Violent  TV  at  8,  Progress  and  Freedom  Foundation  (May  10,  2007);  see  also 
http://www.controlyourtv.org (industry-sponsored site explaining controls available, and offering 
information on how to use them). 

8 The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires that analog television broadcasting cease on Feb-
ruary  17,  2009.  See  Pub.  L.  109–171  (Feb.  8,  2006),  § 3002(b).  After  that,  consumers  will  need 
to obtain a digital receiver or a set-top converter (both of which will include a V-chip), or receive 
television  from  cable  or  satellite  systems  that  enable  parents  to  block  programming  using  the 
same ratings system. 

9 Although digital cable and satellite control boxes are more advanced, both analog and digital 
cable  and  satellite  boxes  allow  parents  to  block  individual  channels  and  lock  them  with  pass-
words.  The  Right  Way  to  Regulate  Violent  TV  at  9–10.  Cable  subscribers  without  set-top  boxes 
also can request that cable providers block channels from coming into their homes. Id. at 9. See 
also  U.S.C.  544(d)(2)  (providing  that  ‘‘[i]n  order  to  restrict  the  viewing  of  programming  which 
is  obscene  or  indecent,  upon  the  request  of  a  subscriber,  a  cable  operator  shall  provide  (by  sale 
or lease) a device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing of a particular cable service dur-
ing periods selected by that subscriber’’). Since March 2004, cable companies providing services 
to  90  percent  of  cable  subscribers  voluntarily  committed  to  providing  blocking  service  for  free.

Fourth,  Parents  can  use  time-shifting  technologies  (such  as  VCRs  and  DVRs)  to 
record  certain  programs  they  deem  appropriate  for  their  children,  and  allow  their 
children to watch only pre-recorded programming. 

Fifth,  rents  can  employ  a  number  of  after-market  solutions  to  limit  the  channels 
their  children  watch  and  the  time  of  day  their  children  are  allowed  to  watch  tele-
vision,  such  as  the  TV  Channel  Blocker  or  various  timers  that  allow  televisions  to 
work only at certain times.11 

Sixth,  rents  can  watch  television  with  their  children  and/or  establish  and  enforce 
rules  about  what  children  can  watch  and  when  they  can  watch  it.  Many  resources, 
such  as  the  Pause,  Parent,  and  Play  Project,12 provide  resources  enabling  parents 
to involve themselves directly in the programming that their children see. 

There are also a number of ratings systems that parents can access to guide their 
choices in using all of the above tools. In addition to the industry’s voluntary ratings 
program,  many  independent  groups  provide  ratings  guides  that  use  their  own  cri-
teria to tell parents what may or may not be appropriate for their children to watch. 
For  example,  the  Parents  Television  Council  provides  the  ‘‘Family  Guide  to  Prime 
Time  Television,’’ 13 Common  Sense  Media  provides  its  own  ratings  based  on  what 
their members think is appropriate for children in six age brackets covering toddlers 
to teenagers,14 and PSV Ratings provides a Family Media Guide that provides par-
ents’ own, individual views about suitability. 

All of these alternatives, and the voluntary ratings systems that accompany them, 
serve the government’s interests in protecting children and increasing parental con-
trol  while  being  far  less  restrictive  in  their  effect  on  First  Amendment  rights.  Two 
features  of  these  alternatives  are  crucial:  they  allow  more  fine-grained  blocking  of 
violent programming, so that blocking can be done by subject matter, time, channel, 
program, show, and so on; and they accomplish this blocking by empowering parents 
rather  than  empowering  government.  As  a  result,  these  voluntary  technologies  im-
pose a significantly smaller burden on First Amendment speech rights. These alter-
natives foreswear imposing burdens of any sort at the source of speech and instead 
strengthen  the  ability  of  each  individual  household  to  govern  the  content  that 
reaches children. They do not restrict access to programming across the board, deny-
ing  such  access  even  to  the  vast  majority  of  American  households  that  contain  no 
young  children.  Moreover,  rather  than  depriving  parents  of  their  right  to  provide 
their children with violent programming that they think is appropriate or even nec-
essary  (such  as  war  movies),  parents  will  retain  freedom  to  decide  for  themselves 
what is appropriate for their younger children. 

On  these  grounds  the  Supreme  Court  has  signaled  approval  of  these  voluntary 
measures  as  less  restrictive  alternatives  to  centralized  regulations  such  as  time 
channeling and unbundling. In Denver Area, in the course of invalidating mandatory 
segregation  and  blocking  measures  for  cable  television,  the  Court  noted  that  vol-
untary  user-initiated  blocking  technologies,  including  the  V-chip,  ‘‘are  significantly 
less  restrictive’’  and  criticized  Congress  for  not  ‘‘explain[ing]  why  . . .  [such]  block-
ing  alone  . . .  cannot  adequately  protect  . . .  children  from  [‘indecent’]  program-
ming.’’  518  U.S.  at  756.  Four  years  later,  in  Playboy,  the  Court  rejected  mandatory 
scrambling  and  time-channeling  provisions  for  pornography  broadcast  on  cable  in 
part  because  it  was  not  persuaded  that  Congress  had  sufficiently  considered  the 
merits  of  voluntary  user-initiated  blocking.  529  U.S.  at  822.  Finally,  in  Reno  v. 
ACLU the Court relied on the existence of less restrictive, potentially effective alter-
natives  to  content-based  regulation—including  ‘‘tagging’’  indecent  Internet  material 
in  a  way  that  ‘‘facilitates  parental  control  of  material  coming  into  their  homes’’— 
to  strike  down  a  congressional  ban  on  indecent  material  on  the  Internet.  521  U.S. 
at  879.  These  precedents  demonstrate  the  priority  of  these  less  restrictive  means 
under the First Amendment. 

Congress  itself  has  recognized  that  these  alternatives  do  present  less  restrictive 
means of protecting children. In the legislation requiring the V-Chip and calling for 
a  complementary  voluntary  rating  system,  Congress  stated  that  the  initiative  was 
intended  to  ‘‘empower[]  parents  to  limit  the  negative  influences  of  video  program-
ming  that  is  harmful  to  children,’’  Pub.  L.  104–104,  § 551(a)(8),  and  found  that 
‘‘[p]roviding  parents  with  timely  information  about  the  nature  of  upcoming  video 
programming  and  with  the  technological  tools  that  allow  them  easily  to  block  vio-

11 These  after-market  units  can  be  programmed  to  block  cable  channels  that  parents  do  not 
wish  to  see  in  their  home,  or  restrict  the  time  of  day  or  total  numbers  of  hours  that  their  chil-
dren are allowed to watch television. These units include special remote controls that limit chil-
dren to a certain group of channels. Id. at 10–12.

lent,  sexual,  or  other  programming  that  they  believe  harmful  to  their  children  is  a 
nonintrusive  and  narrowly  tailored  means  of  achieving  that  compelling  govern-
mental  interest.’’  Id.  § 551(a)(9).  Congress’s  own  recognition  of  these  less  restrictive 
means  to  achieve  the  same  goal  is  an  especially  compelling  indication  that  manda-
tory  restrictions  would  be  unconstitutional.  See  Boos  v.  Barry,  485  U.S.  312,  329 
(1988)  (concluding  that  Congress’s  implementation  of  a  less-restrictive  measure 
‘‘amply demonstrates that the [challenged speech restriction] is not crafted with suf-
ficient precision to withstand First Amendment scrutiny’’); see also Denver Area, 518 
U.S. at 758 (‘‘Congress’s different, and significantly less restrictive’’ V-Chip solution 
suggests ‘‘that the more restrictive means are not ‘essential.’ ’’). 

2. These less restrictive alternatives embody the parent- and individual-cen-
tered  structures  for  regulating  speech  that  the  Supreme  Court  has  recognized 
as preferred by the First Amendment. 

Mandatory government controls over speech content conflict at their core with the 
system  of  free  expression  established  in  this  country—a  system  that  eschews  cen-
tralized  controls  of  speech  in  favor  of  allowing  individuals  to  decide  for  themselves 
what they will read, watch, or observe, and allowing parents and families to decide 
what their children should be exposed to as they mature. In this system, the govern-
ment  may  step  in  to  override  personal  choice  only  when  individuals  exposed  to  un-
wanted  materials  constitute  a  ‘‘captive  audience.’’  Short  of  that  circumstance,  the 
system leaves it to individual adults to avert their gaze from speech that they deem 
objectionable and to shield their children from such speech. See, e.g., Cohen v. Cali-
fornia, 403 U.S. 15, 21 (1971). 

Within  this  system,  the  Supreme  Court  has  preferred  allowing  individuals,  but 
not  the  government,  to  impose  their  own  ‘‘selective  restrictions’’  on  speech  that  ‘‘in-
trudes  on  the  privacy  of  the  home.’’  Erznoznik,  422  U.S.  at  209.  A  pair  of  Supreme 
Court  decisions  illustrates  the  basic  principle.  In  Rowan  v.  Post  Ofice  Department, 
397 U.S. 728, 737 (1970), the Supreme Court upheld a Federal statute empowering 
individuals to give notice to the Post Office that they would rather not receive mail-
ings  from  certain  parties.  But  in  Bolger  v.  Youngs  Drug  Products  Corp.,  463  U.S. 
60,  72  (1983),  the  Court  invalidated  a  Federal  statute  through  which  the  govern-
ment  prohibited  the  mailing  of  unsolicited  ads  for  contraceptives.  The  Bolger  Court 
explained  that  it  has  ‘‘recognized  the  important  interest  in  allowing  addressees  to 
give  notice  to  a  mailer  that  they  wish  no  further  mailings  [citing  Rowan].  But  we 
have never held that the government itself can shut off the flow of mailings to pro-
tect those recipients who might potentially be offended.’’ Id. 

The Supreme Court has only once allowed the FCC to curb speech being broadcast 
into  the  home.  It  did  so  nearly  three  decades  ago  in  Pacifica,  438  U.S.  726  (1978), 
a  decision  that,  as  discussed  earlier,  was  explicitly  limited  to  a  unique  situation:  a 
comic  monologue  focused  on  words  with  explicit  sexual  meaning,  presented  in  no 
broader  literary  or  entertainment  context  than  one  highlighting  their  forbidden 
character,  broadcast  on  the  radio.  But  the  Court  upheld  the  regulation  in  Pacifica 
in  large  part  because,  under  the  technology  available  at  the  time,  there  was  no 
other  way  to  ‘‘protect  the  listener  or  viewer  from  unexpected  program  content,’’ 
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748—a concern that subsequent technological innovations have 
alleviated, at least as to television. See supra Part III(B)(1). 

The  parental  controls  now  available  observe  the  line  established  in  Rowan  and. 
Bolger that allows individuals and parents to edit what comes into the home by vol-
untary blocking, but that does not allow the government to prevent government-de-
fined  content  from  going  into  the  home  in  the  first  place.  Such  controls  are  not,  of 
course,  foolproof,  and  their  use  entails  an  investment  of  time  and  energy  to  super-
vise the television viewing of one’s children. But the salient point is that, taken to-
gether,  these  voluntary,  user-initiated  controls  essentially  allow  parents  to  prevent 
their  children  from  watching  television  programming  that  they  believe  contains  un-
acceptably  violent  content.  This  gives  effect  to  the  government’s  goal  of  protecting 
minor  children  from  viewing  such  content  to  the  degree  the  individual  parents  in-
volved share that goal and think it applicable to their own children. 

Moreover,  these  parental  controls  are  more  effective  than  government  regulation 
at  letting  children  see  what  their  parents  want  them  to  see.  In  Reno  v.  ACLU  and 
Playboy,  the  Supreme  Court  left  no  doubt  that  the  government  has  no  independent 
interest  in  protecting  children  from  objectionable  content  beyond  the  interest  of  as-
sisting those parents who desire to shield their children from such speech. See Reno 
v.  ACLU,  521  U.S.  at  865,  877–78;  Playboy,  529  U.S.  at  811,  813.  The  Commission 
may  not,  for  example,  substitute  its  judgment  for  that  of  parents  who  might  con-
sider  it  entirely  appropriate  that  their  children  be  exposed  to  a  realistic  depiction 
of  the  life  of  police  officers  or  hospital  workers.  Under  our  system,  such  judgments 
are  for  parents,  not  the  government,  to  make.  See  Troxel  v.  Granville,  530  U.S.  57,

66  (2000)  (collecting  multiple  opinions  ‘‘recogniz[ing]  the  fundamental  right  of  par-
ents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children’’); 
Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,  406  U.S.  205,  232  (1972)  (‘‘This  primary  role  of  the  parents  in 
the  upbringing  of  their  children  is  now  established  beyond  debate  as  an  enduring 
American tradition.’’). 

3. The FCC’s criticisms of these alternatives do not save its proposals under 

the First Amendment. 

The  FCC  Report  acknowledges  but  criticizes  a  number  of  less  restrictive  alter-
natives,  focusing  primarily  on  the  V-chip,  cable  blocking  technologies,  and  the  vol-
untary  ratings  system.  These  criticisms  fail  on  both  factual  and  legal  grounds  and 
do  not  excuse  the  government  from  its  obligation  to  use  the  less  restrictive  means 
outlined above. 

Inexplicably,  the  FCC  Report  simply  ignores  almost  all  of  the  alternative  tech-
nologies  discussed  above—a  silence  that  earns  a  sharp  rebuke  from  Commissioner 
Adelstein. See FCC Report at 32–33. As a result, the Report never tackles the legal 
significance  of  the  ever-improving  voluntary  blocking  technologies  now  available  to 
parents, even though the First Amendment mandates a careful appraisal of such al-
ternatives. 

Moreover, the FCC Report engages in a broad-brushed criticism of the V-Chip and 
the  voluntary  ratings  system  without  acknowledging  a  core  analytic  confusion  that 
renders its criticisms incomplete and even incoherent. Blocking technology that fails 
to  shield  children  from  things  the  government  might  prefer  they  not  see  but  that 
their  parents  would  like  them  to  see  (or  are  at  least  indifferent  about  their  seeing) 
cannot  on  that  account  be  deemed  constitutionally  ineffective.  Yet  much  of  the  evi-
dence cited by the FCC Report for the ostensible failings of existing alternatives fo-
cuses  on  statistics  about  parental  inaction  that  give  no  indication  that  determined 
parents  are  unable  to  control  what  their  children  end  up  watching.  For  instance, 
the FCC reports that ‘‘only 15 percent of all parents have used the V-chip,’’ and ‘‘20 
percent  of  parents  know  they  have  a  V-chip,  but  have  not  used  it.’’  FCC  Report  at 
14. But these numbers, even if accurate, say nothing about whether parents are dis-
satisfied  with  the  V-chip,  whether  they  instead  use  one  of  the  many  other  methods 
of  controlling  what  their  children  watch,  or  whether,  as  the  Supreme  Court  noted 
in Playboy, they simply responded to the ‘‘crisis’’ of television violence ‘‘with a collec-
tive yawn.’’ 15 529 U.S. at 816. In other words, that the children of such parents may 
be  seeing  content  that  the  government  would  rather  they  not  see  certainly  does  not 
establish that they are seeing content that their parents would rather they not see. 
Given  the  First  Amendment’s  preference  for  parent-  and  individual-focused  vol-
untary blocking over more restrictive forms of speech regulation, many of the FCC’s 
criticisms are misdirected. 

The FCC Report also fails to recognize the full legal import of the least-restrictive- 
means  requirement.  Even  assuming,  contrary  to  the  evidence,  that  the  alternatives 
listed above are not fully as effective as the FCC’s proposals, those proposals would 
still  flunk  strict  scrutiny  because  a  method  of  achieving  a  compelling  government 
interest  must  be  recognized  as  a  less  restrictive  means  even  if  it  is  not  absolutely 
effective. The Supreme Court has never required a guarantee that no inappropriate 
material  will  reach  children,  nor  has  it  accepted  the  absence  of  such  assurance  as 
a basis to reject a less-restrictive alternative. In Denver Area, the Court stated: ‘‘No 
protection, we concede, short of an absolute ban, can offer certain protection against 
assault  by  a  determined  child.  We  have  not,  however,  generally  allowed  this  fact 
alone to ‘justify reduc[ing] the adult population . . . to . . . only what is fit for chil-
dren.’ ’’  518  U.S.  at  759.  Accordingly,  in  Sable  Communication,  the  Supreme  Court 
invalidated  a  blanket  prohibition  on  indecent  and  obscene  commercial  telephone 
messages transmitted interstate. Access code and screening options that were avail-
able  to  block  children’s  access  to  such  messages  ‘‘provide[d]  the  means  of  dramati-
cally  reducing  the  number  of  calls  from  minors’’  and  were  described  as  having  the 
potential  to  be  ‘‘very  effective’’  but  ‘‘not  foolproof.’’  492  U.S.  at  130  n.  10.  Despite 
the  fact  that  these  options  were  still  largely  untested  and  could  likely  be  overcome 
by  ‘‘the  most  enterprising  and  disobedient  young  people,’’  the  Court  still  deemed 

15 In fact, the study cited by the FCC for its figures itself calls into question the FCC’s conclu-
sion  that  the  V-Chip  is  ineffective.  The  study  reports,  for  instance,  that  ‘‘[t]he  vast  majority  of 
parents  who  have  used  the  V-Chip  say  they  found  it  useful,  including  61  percent  who  say  it 
was ‘very’ useful and 28 percent who say ‘somewhat’ useful,’’ and it notes that ‘‘[a]mong parents 
who are aware that they have a V-Chip but have chosen not to use it, 60 percent say the main 
reason  is  that  an  adult  is  usually  nearby  when  their  kids  watch  TV,  and  20  percent  say  it’s 
because they trust their children to make their own decisions.’’ Kaiser Family Foundation, Par-
ents, Media and Public Policy, at 7 (Fall 2004).

them less restrictive means that invalidated the unquestionably more effective blan-
ket prohibition. Id. at 130. 

In  any  event,  the  V-Chip  and  other  technologies  that  could  be  used  to  block  vio-
lent  programming  are  substantially  more  accessible,  and  in  significantly  wider  use, 
than other technologies that the Supreme Court has deemed effective and constitu-
tionally  preferred  alternatives  to  content  regulation.  In  Reno  v.  ACLU,  the  Court 
cited  as  an  effective  alternative  software  that  was  then  just  a  ‘‘mere  possibility,’’ 
Playboy, 529 U.S. at 814 (discussing Reno v. ACLU), and that ‘‘would soon be widely 
available,’’  Reno  v.  ACLU,  521  U.S.  at  876–877  (emphasis  added).  To  obtain  that 
software, Internet users were required to affirmatively seek out and pay for it. The 
V-chip, by contrast, is already included in all but the smallest new televisions, with 
similar technology already ubiquitous for cable and satellite subscribers, and unlike 
Internet-blocking software, these technologies do not require periodic upgrades that 
must be paid for and installed. 

Finally,  the  FCC  Report  criticizes  certain  existing  technologies  for  being  ineffec-
tive in part because parents remain ignorant of them. But the Supreme Court’s deci-
sions make clear that the proper response to lack of public awareness about a viable 
less-restrictive alternative is greater promotion and support of that alternative, not 
more  burdensome  content-based  regulation.  As  Commissioner  Adelstein  notes,  the 
FCC  Report  fails  to  explain  why  one  should  suppose  that  these  voluntary  tech-
nologies would be insufficient to serve parents’ and children’s interests if they were 
indeed properly publicized and supported. FCC Report at 32–33 (‘‘Instead of rushing 
to conclude that . . . blocking technology does not adequately promote parental su-
pervision  and  protect  the  well-being  of  children,  the  Commission  has  an  obligation 
to  advise  Congress  how  we  can  attempt  to  improve  their  effectiveness.  We  fail  to 
do so here.’’). 

In  Denver  Area,  for  example,  the  government  argued  that  cable  ‘‘lockbox’’  tech-
nology  was  not  a  sufficiently  effective  alternative  because  ‘‘parents  would  have  to 
discover  that  such  devices  exist,’’  and,  among  other  things,  ‘‘learn  how  to  block 
undesired  programs.’’  518  U.S.  at  758  (quoting  government  brief).  The  Court  re-
sponded  that  this  ‘‘list  of  practical  difficulties  would  seem  to  call,  not  for’’  more  in-
trusive  regulation,  ‘‘but,  rather,  for  informational  requirements,  for  a  simple  coding 
system,  for  readily  available  blocking  equipment,’’  and  for  other  measures  likely  to 
increase  effectiveness.  Id.  at  759.  Similarly,  in  Playboy,  the  Court  held  that  user- 
based  blocking  technology  was  a  less  restrictive  alternative  that  rendered  the  stat-
ute  at  issue  there  unconstitutional,  even  though  the  evidence  reflected  that  cable 
consumers  had  made  ‘‘few  requests  for  household-by-household  blocking.’’  529  U.S. 
at  816;  id.  (noting  that  ‘‘fewer  than  0.5  percent  of  cable  subscribers  requested  full 
blocking’’).  Because  the  government  had  failed  to  show  that  blocking  technology 
could  not  be  effective  ‘‘if  publicized  in  an  adequate  manner,’’  the  Court  concluded 
that the challenged legislation was invalid. Id.; see also Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 
at 669 (saying that Congress must ‘‘enact[] programs to promote use of filtering soft-
ware’’  before  declaring  filtering  software  an  ineffective  alternative).  Parental  igno-
rance of less restrictive alternatives cannot justify content regulation. 

C. All of the FCC’s proposals accordingly violate the First Amendment. 

Applying  the  foregoing  analysis  shows  that  the  particular  proposals  advanced  by 
the  FCC  violate  the  First  Amendment  and  would  be  struck  down  by  the  Supreme 
Court. In this section, I would like to highlight the most salient constitutional infir-
mities in each of the FCC’s proposals. 

1. Time Channeling. 

The FCC Report’s time channeling proposal would essentially ban ‘‘impermissibly 
violent’’  television  programming  during  specified  times.  None  of  the  fatal  constitu-
tional  objections  elaborated  in  the  preceding  sections  of  this  submission  is  avoided 
by confining that ban to a portion of the day or night. 

Vagueness:  A  prohibition  that  would  be  unconstitutionally  vague  if  imposed 
around the clock loses none of its vagueness if imposed only during specified times. 
The  vagueness  doctrine  would  invalidate  the  prohibition  during  the  times  in  which 
it was operative as a ban. 

Over-and  under-inclusiveness:  Every  point  made  above  about  over-  and  under-in-
clusiveness remains fully valid when the prohibition is limited to stated times of day 
or  night.  The  content-  and  viewpoint-based  character  of  a  regulation  that  triggers 
a  demand  for  strict  scrutiny  and  accordingly  for  an  exceedingly  close  fit  is  not  di-
minished  in  the  least  by  its  time-limited  character.16 United  States  v.  Playboy 

16 Although  at  first  blush  the  relegation  of  violent  content  to  the  midnight  hours  may  seem 
like a time or manner restriction, such restrictions are content-neutral only if they ‘‘are justified

Entm’t  Group,  Inc.,  529  U.S.  803,  812–13  (2000)  (applying  strict  scrutiny  to  time 
channeling of indecent cable television because ‘‘[i]t is of no moment that the statute 
does  not  impose  a  complete  prohibition’’).  Indeed,  the  ill-fitting  character  of  time 
channeling  is  so  egregious  that  it  would  have  to  be  struck  down  under  the  First 
Amendment  even  if  one  were  to  ignore  altogether  its  content-  and  viewpoint-based 
operation. 

Assuming for the sake of argument that young children are harmed by seeing cer-
tain  kinds  of  violent  television  programming,  and  that  avoiding  this  harm  is  a  per-
missible governmental objective without regard to what a particular child’s parents 
might believe, the fact would remain that time channeling responds to this concern 
far too broadly by denying such programming to vast swaths of the population that 
are  not  remotely  the  subjects  of  the  government’s  concern.  For  example,  nearly 
three-quarters  of  American  television  homes  have  no  children  under  the  age  of 
twelve,17 yet time channeling would preclude everyone in those households from re-
ceiving violent television programming at all during times outside the safe harbor— 
even though those viewers are constitutionally entitled to receive that programming, 
and even though broadcasters and cablecasters are constitutionally entitled to trans-
mit that programming to them. Moreover, even those households with children will 
have adults and older children whom the government cannot claim a compelling in-
terest  in  protecting.  Those  viewers  will  also  be  denied  programming  to  which  they 
are constitutionally entitled. The inevitable effect of time channeling is that, during 
large segments of the day, available television programming would be limited to ma-
terial deemed fit for minors. Even disregarding the constitutional objections to cen-
tralized  determination  of  just  what  material  meets  that  description,  the  First 
Amendment  does  not  permit  the  free  speech  rights  of  adults  and  older  children  to 
be casualties to the government’s paternalism toward the young. 

Less restrictive alternatives. Nor would the time-limited facet of a proposed regula-
tion  escape  the  fatal  criticism  that  individualized  parental  controls  remain  a  con-
stitutionally  preferred  less  restrictive  alternative  for  achieving  any  of  the  law’s 
child-focused objectives. The availability of such individually tailored parental tech-
nologies for child-rearing with respect to television viewing was central, for reasons 
already  discussed,  to  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  United  States  v.  Playboy  En-
tertainment  Group,  Inc.,  529  U.S.  803  (2000),  to  strike  down  a  statute  essentially 
requiring certain cable operators to time channel indecent content. 

In  fact,  in  certain  ways,  the  V-Chip  and  other  blocking  technologies  are  not  only 
less restrictive but also significantly more effective than time channeling in empow-
ering parents to control their children’s viewing. As the Court explained in Playboy, 
blocking mechanisms enable parents to block programming deemed objectionable ‘‘at 
all  times,  even  when  they  are  not  at  home  and  even  after  10  p.m.’’;  by  contrast, 
‘‘[t]ime channeling does not offer this assistance.’’ 529 U.S. at 825. 

2. Mandatory Ratings System. 

The  FCC  Report  recommends  that  Congress  could  also  respond  to  televised  vio-
lence by reforming the current voluntary ratings and blocking system. The most sig-
nificant  component  of  the  proposal  is  the  Report’s  suggestion  that  Congress  imple-
ment an official mandatory ratings system that would require stations to display the 
governmentally  defined  ‘‘appropriate’’  rating  for  each  program.  FCC  Report  at  17. 
Such  a  mandatory  ratings  system  would  likewise  violate  the  First  Amendment  for 
at least two reasons. 

First,  the  definitions  and  guidelines  imposed  by  a  mandatory  ratings  system 
would  be  inherently  subjective,  subject  to  arbitrary  and  inconsistent  interpretation 
by authorities, and thus impermissibly vague. Mandatory ratings systems have been 
uniformly rejected by the Supreme Court under the vagueness doctrine because they 
vest  so  much  power  in  whatever  government  body  applies  and  enforces  the  ratings 
with fines or other punishments. Indeed, the Court is more vigilant about the ‘‘vice 
of  vagueness’’  where  ‘‘expression  is  sought  to  be  subjected  to  licensing,’’  and  that 
‘‘vice’’  is  just  as  dangerous  where  the  ‘‘regulation  of  expression  is  one  of  classifica-
tion’’—i.e.,  mandatory  ratings—‘‘rather  than  direct  suppression.’’  Interstate  Circuit, 
Inc.v. Dallas, 390 U.S. 676, 683, 688 (1968); see also Bantam Books, Inc.v. Sullivan, 

without  reference  to  the  content  of  the  regulated  speech.’’  Ward  v.  Rock  Against  Racism,  491 
U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (quoting Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 
(1984)).  Here,  by  contrast,  time-channeling  legislation  would  almost  certainly  require  television 
programming  with  violent  content  to  be  segregated  to  certain  hours.  Such  identification  of  sub-
ject matter ‘‘slips from the neutrality of time, place, and circumstance into a concern about con-
tent.’’  Police  Dept.  of  Chicago  v.  Mosley,  408  U.S.  92,  99  (1972)  (internal  quotation  marks  and 
citations omitted).

372  U.S.  58,  72  (1963).  Like  a  time-channeling  solution,  any  mandatory  ratings 
scheme  would  suffer  from  all  the  problems  of  subjectivity  and  vagueness  described 
in Part II(A), above, and would be unconstitutional on those grounds alone. 

Second,  a  mandatory  ratings  system  would  impermissibly  force  broadcasters, 
cable/satellite  operators,  and  other  content  providers  to  attach  to  their  television 
programming  a  message  stating  a  government  viewpoint  about  that  programming, 
thus  ‘‘[m]andating  speech  that  a  speaker  would  not  otherwise  make.’’  Riley  v.  Nat’l 
Federation  of  the  Blind  of  N.  Carolina,  Inc.,  487  U.S.  781,  795  (1988).  ‘‘[L]eading 
First  Amendment  precedents  have  established  the  principle  that  freedom  of  speech 
prohibits  the  government  from  telling  people  what  they  must  say.’’  Rumsfeld  v. 
FAIR, 126 S. Ct. 1297, 1308 (2006). ‘‘[T]his general rule . . . applies not only to ex-
pressions  of  value,  opinion,  or  endorsement,  but  equally  to  statements  of  fact  the 
speaker  would  rather  avoid.’’  Hurley  v.  Irish-American  Gay,  Lesbian  and  Bisexual 
Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995). Applying this rule, a plurality of the Su-
preme Court in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Utility Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1 (1986), 
struck  down  a  regulation  requiring  a  privately  owned  utility  to  include  with  its 
monthly bills a newsletter written by a consumer group critical of utilities. The plu-
rality found that compelling the inclusion of this newsletter imposed an unconstitu-
tional  burden  on  the  utility’s  speech,  since  the  regulation  ‘‘impermissibly  require[d] 
[the utility] to associate with speech with which [it] may disagree.’’ Id. at 15. Simi-
larly, in Hurley, the organizers of a St. Patrick’s Day parade challenged a state stat-
ute that required the organizers to include a gay, lesbian, and bisexual group in the 
parade. A unanimous Supreme Court found this application of state anti-discrimina-
tion law unconstitutional. After holding that ‘‘[t]he selection of contingents to make 
a  parade’’  is  protected  expression,  515  U.S.  at  570,  the  Court  held  that,  ‘‘[s]ince 
every participating unit affects the message conveyed by the private organizers, the 
state courts’ application of the statute produced an order essentially requiring peti-
tioners  to  alter  the  expressive  content  of  their  parade.’’  Id.  at  572–73.  Such  a  re-
quirement violated ‘‘the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, 
that  a  speaker  has  the  autonomy  to  choose  the  content  of  his  own  message.’’  Id.  at 
573. 

A  mandatory  ratings  system  would  contravene  this  rule  by  requiring  television 
content  providers  to  attach  to  their  programs  a  government-compelled  message  de-
scribing—and  most  likely  evaluating—the  programs’  violent  content.  For  example, 
content providers may be required to say that their program contains ‘‘violence inap-
propriate for children under the age of 17,’’ or ‘‘violence appropriate for children only 
with  adequate  parental  supervision,’’  even  if  the  content  provider  disagrees  pro-
foundly  with  the  government’s  evaluation.  Such  mandatory  ratings  are  no  different 
from a government requirement that a television program promoting abstinence dis-
close that scientific studies show abstinence programs to be ineffective, or a require-
ment that a show on global warming say that there are still significant doubts about 
the  science  behind  climate  change.  Because  such  compelled  speech  forces  speakers 
to affirm and disseminate beliefs with which they may disagree, they are forbidden 
by the First Amendment. 

The  FCC  Report  defends  a  mandatory  ratings  system  by  saying  that  ‘‘it  merely 
requires the disclosure of truthful information about a potentially harmful product.’’ 
FCC  Report  at  17.  The  Supreme  Court  has  indeed  recognized  that,  ‘‘in  commercial 
advertising,’’ the government may require businesses to disseminate ‘‘purely factual 
and uncontroversial information . . . so long as disclosure requirements are reason-
ably related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consumers.’’ Zauderer 
v.  Off.  of  Disciplinary  Counsel  for  Sup.  Ct.  of  Ohio,  471  U.S.  626,  651  (1985)  (up-
holding  state  law  requiring  attorneys  to  disclose  to  contingent-fee  clients  that  the 
clients  may  have  to  bear  certain  expenses  even  if  they  lose);  see  also  Nat’l  Elec. 
Mfrs.  Ass’n  v.  Sorrell,  272  F.3d  104,  114–16  (2d  Cir.  2001)  (upholding  state  law  re-
quiring  mercury  labeling).  But  this  narrow  exception  to  the  compelled-speech  doc-
trine is inapplicable for two reasons. 

First,  violence  ratings  most  assuredly  are  not  the  sort  of  ‘‘purely  factual  and 
uncontroversial information’’ encompassed by this exception. At the very least, a rat-
ing  represents  a  judgment  about  whether  the  program  contains  ‘‘violence’’  and,  in 
all likelihood, a further judgment about whether that ‘‘violence’’ is ‘‘gratuitous,’’ ‘‘ex-
cessive,’’  or  ‘‘harmful  to  children.’’  These  complex,  highly  subjective,  and  often  con-
troversial  judgments  cannot  be  passed  off  as  simple  factual  statements  and  so  do 
not  fall  under  the  Zauderer  exception.18 Accordingly,  the  Seventh  Circuit  found 

18 Part of the controversy is essentially descriptive and deals with how something is most ac-
curately characterized. But another part is normative: do the benefits of informing the prospec-
tive  ‘‘consumer’’  of  speech  about  what  that  consumer  will  encounter  outweigh  the  costs  of  lost 
surprise, often a key element in dramatic productions?

Zauderer  inapplicable  to  a  mandatory  labeling  program  for  ‘‘sexually  explicit’’  video 
games,  since  it  found  that  such  labels  ‘‘communicate[]  a  subjective  and  highly  con-
troversial  message—that  the  game’s  content  is  sexually  explicit.’’  Entertainment 
Software Ass’n v. Blagojevich, 469 F.3d 641, 652 (7th Cir. 2006). 

Second,  Zauderer  has  not  been  applied  outside  the  commercial-speech  context— 
where,  as  the  Supreme  Court  has  held,  a  lower  standard  of  scrutiny  may  apply  to 
speech that does ‘‘no more than propose a commercial transaction,’’ Pittsburgh Press 
Co.  v.  Pittsburgh  Comm’n  on  Human  Relations,  413  U.S.  376,  385  (1973)—but  the 
vast  majority  of  television  programming  to  which  mandatory  ratings  would  be  at-
tached  is  not  commercial  speech.  Television  shows  express  ideas,  they  do  not  hawk 
wares. 

Because  strict  scrutiny  applies  here,  the  availability  of  less  restrictive  means  for 
the government to achieve its ends—namely, the existing voluntary ratings system, 
and the growing arsenal of voluntary blocking technologies—weighs heavily against 
the permissibility of a mandatory ratings system. The FCC Report gives two reasons 
for  finding  these  other  means  ineffective:  first,  parents  do  not  understand  the  vol-
untary system; and second, the ratings are often inaccurate. FCC Report at 15. The 
first problem cannot justify avoiding a less restrictive means; under Playboy, as dis-
cussed  above,  the  government  can  respond  to  parental  ignorance  with  a  publicity 
campaign. One possible model is a cross-industry public education campaign on pa-
rental controls and ratings, brought in 2006 by a wide spectrum of content creators 
and  broadcast/cable/satellite  operators,  that  utilized  public  service  announcements 
and  educational  websites  such  as  TheTVBoss.org.  The  government  could  easily  en-
gage in a similar campaign here—and, under the First Amendment, Congress must 
exhaust that option before turning to content regulation. The Seventh Circuit relied 
on  this  reasoning  to  strike  down  the  state  law  in  Blagojevich:  although  the  state 
attempted to justify mandatory labels by arguing that the game industry’s voluntary 
rating system was not widely understood, the court held that the state was required 
to  adopt  the  less  restrictive  means  of  ‘‘a  broader  educational  campaign  about  the 
[voluntary] system.’’ 469 F.3d at 652. 

The  second  asserted  problem—allegedly  inaccurate  ratings—also  cannot  justify  a 
more restrictive mandatory ratings system.19 For one thing, nothing about the cen-
tralized  or  governmentally  dictated  nature  of  a  mandatory  ratings  system  ensures 
that  it  will  be  more  accurate—and,  indeed,  the  FCC  Report  acknowledges  that  a 
government-run  ratings  system  might  not  improve  on  accuracy.  FCC  Report  at  17. 
The  FCC  Report  also  does  not  explain  why  cooperation  with  the  industry—or  even 
encouraging alternative ratings from private institutions—could not increase the ac-
curacy  of  ratings.  Moreover,  parents  need  not  rely  simply  on  published  ratings  to 
protect their children. As noted above, available technologies allow parents to block 
specific  programs  and  specific  channels  based  on  their  own  viewing  of  the  content, 
on  descriptions  of  the  shows  in  TV  channel  listings,  or  on  descriptions  from  friends 
or other sources. 

Finally, even assuming that a mandatory ratings system would be considered con-
tent-neutral, it would still violate the First Amendment because it would not be nar-
rowly  tailored  to  the  government’s  concerns.  Rather  than  limiting  the  scope  of  its 
burdens to conveyers of violent television programming, a mandatory ratings system 
would compel speech from all speakers—even those who generate and distribute no 
violent content. For example, a content provider may be required to say that a pro-
gram is ‘‘appropriate for children,’’ even if the provider is afraid that this description 
will  unfairly  (and  inaccurately)  cause  viewers  to  believe  that  the  program  is  white- 
washed,  infantile,  or  of  little  interest  to  adults.  Whatever  the  government’s  power 
to  compel  speech  from  providers  of  violent  content,  the  First  Amendment  prohibits 
it  from  imposing  such  burdens  on  the  free  speech  of  other  content  providers  who 
do not do anything remotely objectionable. 

3. Mandatory Unbundling. 

The  FCC  Report’s  final  legislative  proposal  is  for  Congress  to  require  cable  and 
satellite  operators  to  unbundle  channels  and  to  offer  individual  consumers  the  op-
tion  to  choose  which  channels  they  will  receive.  This  unbundling  could  take  one  of 
two  general  forms.  First,  cable/satellite  operators  could  provide  consumers  with  a 
full  slate  of  programming  as  a  default,  but  empower  consumers  to  ‘‘opt  out’’  of  any 

19 There is considerable doubt, to say the least, about whether parents in fact perceive ratings 
to  be  inaccurate.  The  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  Survey  cited  by  the  FCC,  see  FCC  Report  at 
16–18, states that ‘‘about half (52 percent) of those who have used the ratings saying that most 
shows  are  rated  in  a  way  that  accurately  reflects  their  content,’’  and  further  notes  that  ‘‘[t]he 
vast majority of parents who have used the TV ratings say they find them useful,’’ Kaiser Fam-
ily Foundation, Parents, Media and Public Policy, at 5 (Fall 2004).

channels  they  do  not  wish  to  receive.  Under  this  proposal,  consumers  either  would 
not  have  to  pay  for  opt-out  channels,  or  would  receive  a  refund  for  those  channels. 
Alternatively, cable/satellite operators could reserve certain channels (such as those 
with violent content) or all channels (as in a complete a` la carte regime) and require 
subscribers  to  ‘‘opt  in’’  to  those  specific  channels  that  they  wish  to  receive.  Both  of 
these mandatory unbundling alternatives fail strict scrutiny. 

a. First Amendment strict scrutiny applies to mandatory unbundling. 

It  is  tempting  to  think  of  any  unbundling  requirement  as  a  purely  economic  re-
striction  not  based  on  speech,  but  that  view  is  flatly  incorrect.  Any  unbundling  re-
quirement  would  be  a  speech-based  and  even  a  content-based  regulation  subject  to 
strict  scrutiny.  The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  ‘‘[c]able  programmers  and 
cable  operators  engage  in  and  transmit  speech,  and  they  are  entitled  to  the  protec-
tion  of  the  speech  and  press  provisions  of  the  First  Amendment.’’  Turner  Broad-
casting  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  518  U.S.  622,  636  (1994).  ‘‘[T]hrough  original  program-
ming or by exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include 
in  its  repertoire,  [cable/satellite  operators]  seek[]  to  communicate  messages  on  a 
wide  variety  of  topics  and  in  a  wide  variety  of  formats.’’  Los  Angeles  v.  Preferred 
Commc’ns,  Inc.,  476  U.S.  488,  494  (1986);  see  also  Hurley,  575  U.S.  at  570  (‘‘Cable 
operators . . . are engaged in protected speech activities even when they only select 
programming  originally  produced  by  others.’’).  More  specifically,  Turner  recognized 
that  requiring  cable  operators  to  bundle  certain  channels  against  their  will 
‘‘interfere[d]  with  [their]  editorial  discretion.’’  512  U.S.  at  643–44.  Forbidding  them 
from  bundling  certain  channels—especially  if  the  decision  is  driven  by  the  content 
of those channels—would have a similar effect: an operator’s decision to include par-
ticular  channels  is  at  least  as  expressive  as  its  decision  to  exclude  others.  Hurley, 
575  U.S.  at  570  (holding  that  ‘‘[t]he  selection  of  contingents  to  make  a  parade’’  is 
First Amendment speech). 

In this regard, cable/satellite providers are no different from other speakers. A de-
cision  to  combine  or  package  expressive  materials  is  a  speech  act  distinct  from  the 
decisions  to  distribute  its  individual  components,  separately  considered.  For  exam-
ple,  Tim  O’Brien’s  The  Things  They  Carried  is  ostensibly  a  collection  of  vignettes 
about  the  Vietnam  War,  each  of  which  can  be  read  and  understood  separately.  To-
gether,  however,  their  cumulative  effect  is  a  devastating  exploration  of  the  effects 
of combat on young soldiers. Unlike a disaggregated set, a combination of materials 
allows direct comparisons between the individual pieces; it allows meaning to be cre-
ated  through  repetition  and  parallelism;  and  it  allows  expression  that  derives  from 
the  very  act  of  combination  or  juxtaposition.  It  makes  no  difference  that—as  some 
people  undoubtedly  believe—no  distinct  message  can  be  attributed  to  cable/satellite 
providers’ aggregation of channels. ‘‘[A] narrow, succinctly articulable message is not 
a  condition  of  constitutional  protection.’’  Hurley,  515  U.S.  at  569–70.  Otherwise, 
Congress  could  force  newspapers  to  distribute  by  the  section  and  forbid  recording 
companies  from  packaging  different  songs,  artists,  albums,  or  genres  into  a  single 
compilation.  Nor  does  it  make  a  difference  that  cable  operators  combine  not  just 
their  own  content  but  also  content  provided  by  others.  Speakers  often  speak  by  in-
voking the words of others, but doing so does not jeopardize their First Amendment 
rights. See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 570 (noting that newspaper editorial pages, like pa-
rades, are also ‘‘compilation[s] of speech generated by other persons’’). 

It is true that in Turner, the Supreme Court applied only intermediate scrutiny— 
a  standard  lower  than  strict  scrutiny—to  uphold  the  must-carry  provisions  of  the 
Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which required 
cable  operators  to  carry  the  signals  of  certain  local  broadcast  stations.  But  for  a 
number  of  reasons  the  must-carry  provisions  are  distinguishable  from  the 
unbundling proposed by the FCC Report. 

First,  the  Supreme  Court  applied  intermediate  scrutiny  in  Turner  because  it 
found that the must-carry provisions were imposed ‘‘without reference to the content 
of speech’’; not only was the statute content-neutral on its face, but Congress’s mani-
fest  purpose  was  simply  to  ‘‘preserve  access  to  free  television  programming.’’  512 
U.S. at 643, 646. The various unbundling schemes proposed by the FCC Report and 
by  earlier  studies  are  quite  different.  Some  past  unbundling  proposals  have  sug-
gested  requiring  ‘‘themed  tiers’’;  i.e.,  each  bundle  of  channels  would  be  defined  by 
a  certain  type  of  content,  such  as  ‘‘sports,’’  ‘‘news,’’  or—for  our  purposes—‘‘violent 
content.’’  Legislation  mandating  such  unbundling  would  be  content-based  on  its 
face—since it would expressly premise cable/satellite operators’ obligations upon the 
content  of  the  channels  they  carried—and  thus  would  be  subject  to  strict  scrutiny. 
Even  if  the  relevant  bundles  are  defined  in  a  content-neutral  way,  the  purpose

vision  programming.  FCC  Report  at  21.  This  purpose  requires  evaluating  even  os-
tensibly content-neutral unbundling under strict scrutiny. ‘‘[E]ven a regulation neu-
tral  on  its  face  may  be  content-based  if  its  manifest  purpose  is  to  regulate  speech 
because of the message it conveys.’’ Turner, 512 U.S. at 645. This is not to say that 
troublesome  motives  expressed  by  individual  Members  of  Congress  can  serve  to  in-
validate  a  statute  under  the  First  Amendment  if  the  statute  is  content-neutral  on 
its face and serves content-neutral ends. See United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 
382–83  (1968).  But  when  the  ‘‘asserted  interest’’  offered  to  justify  a  specifically 
speech-burdening  regulation  is  itself  related  to  the  suppression  of  that  speech—as 
is  the  case  here—strict  scrutiny  is  appropriate  even  for  facially  content-neutral 
laws.  See  United  States  v.  Eichman,  496  U.S.  310,  315  (1990)  (striking  down  flag- 
burning  statute  when  Congress’s  purpose  was  to  suppress  that  form  of  expression). 
Second, the Court in Turner found that requiring the bundling of broadcast chan-
nels  would  not  ‘‘force  cable  operators  to  alter  their  own  messages’’  because  ‘‘there 
appears little risk that cable viewers would assume that the broadcast stations car-
ried  on  a  cable  system  convey  ideas  or  messages  endorsed  by  the  cable  operator.’’ 
Id.  at  655.  Mandatory  unbundling,  however,  raises  distinct  concerns  because  it  di-
rectly intrudes upon a cable operator’s speech by precluding speech achievable only 
by combining channels. For example, a cable operator may wish to provide a public 
service by bundling C–SPAN or local public-access channels with more popular fare 
such  as  ESPN.  Similarly,  a  cable  operator’s  decision  to  include  adult  channels—as 
much as another operator’s decision to exclude those channels—is an exercise of its 
core  editorial  discretion.  Although  the  must-carry  provisions  at  issue  in  Turner  did 
not  block  this  type  of  editorial  control,  unbundling  legislation  would.  Mandatory 
unbundling  also  interferes  with  the  speech  rights  of  content  providers  in  ways  that 
the mandatory bundling in Turner did not. If cable/satellite operators are forbidden 
from  transmitting  certain  content  in  a  bundle,  then  content  providers  are  concomi-
tantly  forbidden  from  offering  that  content  in  combination:  e.g,,  a  media  company 
that wants to package a family-friendly channel (which contains no violent program-
ming)  with  a  sports  channel  or  a  young  adult  channel  (both  of  which  contain  some 
violent programming). By contrast, the must-carry provisions in Turner did not pre-
vent content providers from packaging their products in this manner. 

Finally,  Turner  relied  in  part  on  the  special  nature  of  the  cable  industry  at  the 
point  in  time  when  the  opinion  was  decided.  But  the  fact  that  cable  providers  bun-
dle  content  does  not  in  any  way  distinguish  them  from  other  forms  of  media.  Bun-
dles are ubiquitous in the marketplace of ideas, as in every other marketplace: mu-
sicians  package  songs  into  albums  (including  ‘‘greatest  hit’’  albums  that  have  no 
central  theme  or  concept);  authors  collect  volumes  of  short  stories  or  essays;  and 
newspapers  include  multiple  unrelated  sections  (not  to  mention  hundreds  of  unre-
lated  articles)  in  a  single  issue.  Many  consumers  would  undoubtedly  prefer  to  pur-
chase  such  items  piecemeal—and,  under  certain  circumstances,  the  market  has  re-
sponded to give them that option, as with the iTunes Store—but a` la carte consump-
tion  is  hardly  the  rule,  and  I  am  aware  of  no  law  requiring  these  other  forms  of 
media to distribute their speech piece by piece. Moreover, no ‘‘monopoly power’’ pos-
sessed  by  cable  providers  distinguishes  them  from  other  forms  of  media.  In  many 
areas, for example, the realities of the marketplace allow only one newspaper to op-
erate—but nobody proposes requiring such newspapers to sell their issues article by 
article,  or  section  by  section.  Thus,  imposing  an  unbundling  requirement  on  cable 
providers  would  burden  their  editorial  discretion  through  a  regulatory  regime  to 
which no other medium is subject, even though the reasons for imposing unbundling 
rely upon no distinctive feature of cable. Absent a ‘‘special characteristic’’ that would 
justify  differential  treatment,  ‘‘[r]egulations  that  discriminate  among  media  . . . 
often present serious First Amendment concerns’’ and are generally subject to strict 
scrutiny. Turner, 512 U.S. at 659–60. 

b.  The  First  Amendment  scrutiny  of  unbundling  is  unaffected  by  the  in-

volvement of money. 

Proponents  of  mandatory  unbundling  have  at  times  suggested  that  unbundling 
can avoid strict scrutiny so long as it is only focused on the compensation that cable/ 
satellite operators can hope to receive, rather than the content that they are empow-
ered  to  convey.  Thus,  for  instance,  an  opt-out  unbundling  program  would  allow 
cable/satellite operators to provide bundles however they saw fit, but it would simul-
taneously obligate them to return a portion of a consumer’s subscription costs if the 
consumer decided to opt out of receiving certain channels. 

Such a proposal cannot escape strict scrutiny. The freedom to speak is inseparable 
from  the  freedom  to  decide  whether  to  charge  for  that  speech  or,  instead,  to  dis-
tribute  it  without  financial  remuneration.  To  put  the  point  another  way,  ‘‘freedom 
of  speech’’  encompasses  not  only  the  right  to  make  one’s  speech  available  without 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

52 

charge; it encompasses as well the right to decide for oneself whether to seek finan-
cial gain from one’s speech by offering it at a price, or instead to provide one’s own 
speech free of charge. This principle recognizes that, given the necessities of speak-
ers’  lives  and  business  operations,  speech  will  often  be  stillborn  as  a  practical  mat-
ter  absent  the  concomitant  opportunity  to  profit  from  speaking.  Granting  govern-
ment  the  power  to  control  compensation  for  specific  types  of  speech  would  let  the 
government drive speech from the marketplace—and hence from the public sphere— 
by removing one of the principal enablers for speaking or publishing. In this sense, 
one’s  right  to  profit  from  speech  is  similar  to  one’s  right  to  seek  financial  reward 
for one’s labor, as protected by the Thirteenth Amendment’s prohibition on slavery, 
or  to  use  one’s  private  property  for  financial  gain,  as  protected  by  the  Takings  and 
Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The right to speak— 
or work, or own property—would be altogether hollow if the government could force 
people to give up any hope of compensation when engaging in these constitutionally 
protected activities. 

The  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  these  basic  principles.  In  New  York  Times  v. 
Sullivan,  376  U.S.  254,  266  (1964),  the  Court  held  that  the  First  Amendment  fully 
protected statements made in a commercial advertisement in The New York Times, 
even  though  the  Times  had  been  paid  to  publish  that  advertisement.  Subsequent 
cases have directly recognized that the First Amendment protects the right to profit 
from speech as much as it protects the right to speak at all. For example, in Simon 
& Schuster, Inc. v. Members of New York State Crime Victims, 502 U.S. 105 (1991), 
the  Supreme  Court  found  ‘‘presumptively  inconsistent  with  the  First  Amendment’’ 
a  state  statute  that  denied  accused  or  convicted  criminals  the  income  from  works 
describing their crimes. Id. at 115. Similarly, in United States v. National Treasury 
Employees Union, 513 U.S. 454 (1995), the Court struck down a Federal law forbid-
ding  certain  Federal  employees  from  accepting  payment  for  speech  unrelated  to 
their  employment.  Nor  should  any  of  this  seem  surprising.  After  all,  the  First 
Amendment is most commonly invoked, not by uncompensated pamphleteers, but by 
the  publishing  industry  and  by  journalists  and  authors  who  are  paid  for  what  they 
write and distribute. 

Like the laws struck down in these cases, an unbundling requirement would oper-
ate to bar cable/satellite operators and content providers from deriving income from 
speech  whose  content  is  composed  of  bundles  of  distinct  channels.  Congress  can  no 
more  impose  such  a  burden  than  it  could  mandate  that  newspapers  refund  sub-
scribers  for  any  portion  of  the  paper  that  they  do  not  wish  to  receive,  or  require 
musicians to refund their fans for any songs on an album that they dislike. Because 
the  ability  to  profit  from  speech  is  joined  at  the  hip  with  the  production  of  speech, 
regulations of such income abridge First Amendment rights. See McConnell v. FEC, 
540 U.S. 93, 251 (2003) (Scalia, J., concurring) (‘‘The right to speak would be largely 
ineffective if it did not include the right to engage in financial transactions that are 
the incidents of its exercise.’’). 

Some proposals have suggested that the government implement an unbundling re-
quirement  not  by  directly  requiring  unbundling  but  by  withholding  certain  govern-
ment benefits—such as approval of certain changes in media ownership—from cable/ 
satellite  operators  who  do  not  unbundle.  Such  a  strategy  would  impose  unconstitu-
tional conditions on the exercise of operators’ First Amendment rights to bundle con-
tent  and  to  charge  for  that  bundling.  ‘‘[C]onditions  upon  public  benefits  cannot  be 
sustained if they so operate, whatever their purpose, as to inhibit or deter the exer-
cise  of  First  Amendment  freedoms.’’  Sherbert  v.  Verner,  374  U.S.  398,  405  (1963). 
In  Speiser  v.  Randall,  357  U.S.  513  (1958),  for  example,  the  Supreme  Court  held 
that  the  government  could  not  condition  a  tax  exemption  on  an  individual’s  agree-
ment  not  to  advocate  the  overthrow  of  the  government.  ‘‘To  deny  an  exemption  to 
claimants  who  engage  in  certain  forms  of  speech  is  in  effect  to  penalize  them  for 
such  speech.  Its  deterrent  effect  is  the  same  as  if  the  State  were  to  fine  them  for 
this speech.’’ Id. at 518. The withholding of government benefits to discourage First 
Amendment  speech  is  no  different  from  and  no  more  constitutional  than  the  direct 
impediment of that speech. 

c.  Unbundling’s  burdens  on  First  Amendment  rights  cannot  be  justified. 
The  burdens  imposed  by  an  unbundling  requirement  cannot  be  justified  by  the 
government’s alleged interest in protecting children from televised violence. Indeed, 
unbundling is a singularly ineffective tool for achieving this end. For unbundling to 
be even arguably effective at shielding children from televised violence, violent con-
tent  and  non-violent  content  would  have  to  be  segregated  into  different  channels. 
But they are not: as the broad examples given by groups like the Parents Television 
Council  show,  material  which  has  been  criticized  as  objectionably  violent  can  be 
found  on  almost  all  cable/satellite  channels,  in  the  form  of  police  procedurals,  med-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

53 

ical  dramas,  science  fiction,  physical  comedy  and  cartoons,  music  videos,  movies, 
and  much  else.  Moreover,  because  an  unbundling  requirement  would  apply  only  to 
cable/satellite  programming,  it  would  leave  untouched  the  many  other  media  ave-
nues  by  which  children  can  become  exposed  to  violent  content—most  prominently, 
the  Internet.  Thus,  unbundling  cannot  effectively  address  the  government’s  pur-
ported interest in limiting children’s access to violent content. 

Even  if  unbundling  were  effective,  it  would  still  impose  an  unjustifiable  burden 
on First Amendment rights in light of better tailored and less restrictive means for 
the government to achieve its goals. In Denver Area, the Supreme Court specifically 
recognized  the  existence  of  such  ‘‘significantly  less  restrictive’’  alternatives—includ-
ing  the  V-chip—in  striking  down  the  unbundling  statute  at  issue  in  that  case,  518 
U.S. at 756, and I have already highlighted the ever-increasing number of ways that 
parents  can  protect  their  children.  By  contrast,  an  unbundling  requirement  would 
impose  restrictions  on  all  channels  and  all  cable/satellite  operators,  whether  or  not 
they contained or transmitted violent content. In light of less restrictive alternatives 
that  are  readily  available,  the  First  Amendment  does  not  permit  unbundling  as  a 
response to violent television programming. 

As  an  economic  matter,  bundling  allows  at  least  some  cable/satellite  providers  to 
promote new channels that have yet to find an audience and to support niche chan-
nels that have a devoted but numerically insignificant following. In this way, many 
believe, cable/satellite providers can ensure the continued existence of channels that 
would  not,  by  themselves,  justify  their  costs.  This  type  of  cross-subsidization  and 
cross-marketing  is  common:  magazines  such  as  Vanity  Fair  use  glossy  spreads  to 
support in-depth reporting; many newspapers undoubtedly rely on the greater popu-
larity of sections such as sports and entertainment to prop up less popular sections; 
and musicians invariably leverage popular singles into sales for more obscure songs 
on their albums. From the perspective of some cable/satellite providers, being forced 
to unbundle would spell an end to their ability to engage in these salutary practices, 
potentially  dooming  untested  or  niche  channels  even  if  those  channels  contain  no 
content that is in the least objectionable. 

But the validity of this economic argument is beside the point of my First Amend-
ment  analysis.  The  crucial  focus,  rather,  is  on  who  decides  whether  and  when  to 
unbundle—on who chooses whether to link Content A with Content B in the market-
place of ideas, information, and expression. It is not simply the fact that unbundling 
might reduce the quantity and diversity of speech that puts mandatory unbundling 
on  a  collision  course  with  the  First  Amendment.  Even  if,  on  balance,  unbundling 
could  be  shown  to  increase  that  quantity  and  diversity,  it  is  emphatically  the  cen-
tralized  governmental  compulsion  to  unbundle  that  the  First  Amendment  forbids 
when, as here, there is no close fit to a compelling governmental objective. And this 
prohibition  is  underscored,  not  ameliorated,  by  the  undeniable  circumstance  that 
this centralized determination is being driven in large part by a viewpoint-discrimi-
natory  and  paternalistic  concern  with  expressive  content,  rather  than  by  content- 
neutral  economic  considerations,  as  in  the  case  of  the  anti-tying  prohibitions  of  the 
antitrust  laws.  The  First  Amendment  does  not  tolerate  such  a  legislated  shift  from 
individualized  determination  of  proper  expression.  Any  regulation  of  television  con-
tent must recognize that our system of government rightfully places this determina-
tion in the hands of individual families and parents, not those of Big Brother.

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Mr. Tribe. 
It’s  interesting,  because  I’ve  heard  these  comments  so  often,  for 
so  many  years,  ‘‘Let’s  figure  out  a  way  to  do  this  fairly,  let’s  get 
the  industry  cooperating,  let’s’’—I,  myself,  thought  that  Jack 
Valenti’s $250 million advertising program was a gigantic joke, be-
cause  it  does  nothing,  it  means  nothing.  Mailings  to  parents  mean 
nothing. If parents don’t have V-Chip equipment on their pre-2000 
television set, it means nothing. If parents do have that, but, them-
selves, are watching the program, because they choose to, and their 
children are watching with them, all of this means nothing.

So,  to  me,  as  always,  the  question  is,  if  you  simply  find  a  way 
to  cause  the  media  to  not  put  this  content  on,  to  the  extent  that 
they do, that solves the problem, solves all of the problem. But they 
won’t  do  that,  because  they  can’t  do  that,  because  they  have 
sweeps,  they’ve  got  to  make  money,  they’re  in  desperate  competi-
tion,  there  are  too  many  of  them  in  the  first  place,  you  know,  one 
almost  doesn’t  watch  television  anymore,  because  there  is  such  a 
proliferation. 

In  any  event,  I  do  think  that  there  is  a  solution  for  this,  and  I 
do  think  that  just  saying,  ‘‘We’ve  got  to  teach  the  parents  how  to 
do  better,’’  is  a  real  cop-out.  I  don’t  argue  that  it’s  very—it’s  ex-
tremely important. I’m just saying that there are many, many par-
ents  who  don’t  do  that,  or  who  do  have  double  jobs,  who  don’t  get 
home  on  time,  and—so  that  the  tenor  of  most  of  this  has  been 
we’ve been through this for a very long time now, without any im-
provement. 

And  I’ll  just  say,  for  the  entire  panel,  excluding  you,  Mr.  Tribe, 
what  you  said,  Mr.  McIntyre,  and  that  is  the  U.S.  Surgeon  Gen-
eral—I  guess  it  was  you,  Dr.  Kunkel—or,  I  guess  it  was  you,  Mr. 
Winter—the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  the  American  Psy-
chological  Association,  and  the  American  Medical  Association,  vir-
tually  every  other  leading  medical  scientific  organization  that  has 
studied  this  issue  have  reached  the  same  conclusion  about  the 
harmful  impact  of  media  violence  on  our  children.  Is  there  anyone 
on the panel who disagrees with this conclusion, that excessive and 
graphic violence is harmful to children? 

I’m asking for a yes-or-no answer. 
Mr.  LIGUORI.  Sir,  the  research,  again,  as  the  Government 

has—— 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. I’m asking for a yes-or-no answer. 
Mr. LIGUORI. No. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Others? 
[No response.] 
Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  All  right.  I  believe  the  entertainment  in-
dustry  could  change  what  we  watch  on  television,  but  it  chooses 
to—this is a general question for the panel—chooses to sell sex and 
violence  instead.  I  reject  the  notion  that  television  merely  reflects 
our society, the appetites that Senator Lautenberg was referring to, 
but,  rather,  I  believe  that  television  can  and  should  be  something 
of  a  positive  force—a  productive  force.  If  television  merely  reflects 
society,  it  would  appear  that  our  own  society  consists  of  nothing 
but  sexually  promiscuous  20-year-olds  and  serial  killers.  I  know 
that this statement is an exaggeration, but it’s not far off from the 
overwhelming majority of prime-time shows, in my view. 

So,  my  question  is,  does  anyone  wish  to  comment  on  this  state-
ment?  I  would  like  to  understand  the  process  that  networks  and 
other content producers use to determine what goes on the air, and 
why  more  family  oriented  programming  is  not  given  a  chance  to 
build an audience. 

I guess that would go to you, wouldn’t it? 
Mr. LIGUORI. Yes, it would. 
First  of  all,  let’s  discuss  the  process  by  which  programming 
reaches our air. We, at FOX—and so do my other network heads— 
have broadcast standards departments. Again, when a show is sub-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

55 

mitted,  we,  at  the  initiation  of  that  show,  from  script  to  shooting 
script  to  rough  cut  to  revision  to  final  version,  put  those  shows 
through  our  broadcast  standards  systems.  Those  broadcast  stand-
ards  look  both  at  what  the  industry  is  doing,  as  well  as  our  own 
internal standards. From that point, what we do is rate that show 
and  make  sure  that  that  rating  is  in  place  for  parents  to  decide 
what is appropriate and not appropriate for their homes. 

Second,  beyond  the  prima  facie  rating  of  TV–G,  TV–PG,  TV–14, 
we  also  look  to  have  descriptors,  which  further  a  parent’s  under-
standing as to why that show is rated. Now, we in the industry are 
taking  a—yet  another  look  at  how  to  create  more  consistency  of 
those descriptors and enrich those descriptors. We, at FOX, tend to 
be fairly generous with it. 

When you have a show like ‘‘24’’—which, again, we want to abso-
lutely  make  sure  parents  know  what  type  of  programming  they’re 
going to get—we start that show off with a 4-second full-screen ad-
visory,  our  star  reads  that  advisory,  it’s  followed  by  a  15-second 
bug,  and  then,  coming  out  of  each  commercial  break,  we  put  that 
ratings bug up again. So, again, there is a system, and there is in-
formation  that—we  make  sure  they  both  are  in  place  so  parents 
can  make  an  informed  decision  as  to  what  shows  are  appropriate 
for their family. 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. My time is up. 
Vice Chairman Stevens? 
Senator STEVENS. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
You  know,  Mr.  Winter,  I’ve  met  Mr.  Spielberg,  and  I  appreciate 
what  you  said,  but  we  have  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  ‘‘Band  of 
Brothers’’  was  banned  from  being  shown  on  television.  I  think 
there  are—sometimes  people  go  to  extremes.  I  certainly  believe 
that  a  historical  movie  such  as  that  is  something  that  young  chil-
dren should see, but, beyond that—— 

Mr.  Tribe,  where  do  we  go,  have  you  heard,  and  I’m  sure  you 
know,  that  the  tremendous  pressures  that  we  all  feel  about  this 
subject  of  trying  to  provide  protection.  We’ve  tried  to  do  it  from  a 
point of view of the time of day. We had a—‘‘8 o’clock in the morn-
ing  until  9  o’clock  at  night’’  concept  that  we  were  looking  at,  in 
terms  of  content,  and  having  other  content  be  more  permissible 
after  9  p.m.  Does  that  cross  the  lines  of  constitutionality,  to  you? 
Mr.  TRIBE.  I’m  afraid  it  does,  Senator  Stevens.  It  just  means, 
first  of  all,  that  there  is  an  absolute  ban,  except  during  a  certain 
time.  That  is,  time  channeling  that  provides  a  safe  harbor  doesn’t 
solve  the  problem  of  vagueness,  it  doesn’t  solve  the  problem  of 
viewpoint discrimination, it doesn’t solve the problem that, at other 
times, adults are being reduced to what is appropriate for children, 
it  doesn’t  solve  the  problem  that  the  Supreme  Court  will  strike  it 
down,  because  it  has  said  that  segregating  indecent  sexual  pro-
gramming  to  a  certain  time  is  a  kind  of  absolute  ban  on  one  slice 
of  time.  So,  although  time  channeling  is  tempting,  it’s  only  vol-
untary,  industry-based,  parent-organization-based  or  nongovern-
mental-organization-based solutions that are going to pass muster. 
Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  if  that  one  scene,  where  that  policeman 
was  having  the  act  performed  from—was  done  on  the  corner  of 
Fifth Avenue in New York, that could be punished for being a lewd 
and lascivious act in public, right?

56 

Mr.  TRIBE.  Well,  in  fact,  that  scene  was  probably  ‘‘obscene’’  by 
the Supreme Court’s standards. But that is a very different regime 
of  applicable  law.  Under  decisions  like  Miller  v.  California  and 
Paris  Adult  Theatre,  obscene,  explicit,  graphic  depictions  of  sexual 
acts  that  are  patently  offensive  and  lack  any  serious  scientific  or 
literary merit are unprotected speech. But ever since 1948, the Su-
preme  Court  has  made  clear  that  violence  and  obscenity  are  very 
different. Violence—of the sort that we see every night in coverage 
about the war in Iraq—is pervasive in public display and literature 
throughout  history,  and  the  attempt  to  use  the  violent  element,  as 
opposed  to  the  sexual  element,  as  a  basis  for  either  prohibition  or 
time  channeling  or  segregation  onto  particular  slices  of  the  spec-
trum or particular channels is just not going to wash with the Su-
preme Court. 

Senator  STEVENS.  Well,  is  there—is  it  possible  at  all  to  draw  a 
constitutionally safe line, in terms of what we’re dealing with here 
today? 

Mr.  TRIBE.  I  think,  in  terms  of  defining  ‘‘violence,’’  there  is  no 

safe line that can be drawn, other than empowering parents. 

Senator STEVENS. Well, could we—— 
Mr. TRIBE. I don’t think it’s a coincidence—— 
Senator  STEVENS.—could  we  empower  parents  to  have  a  special 
suit against any entity that displayed something like that, that we 
saw? That is—that is within the Supreme Court’s definition of real-
ly  ‘‘obscene’’  and  ‘‘lewd  and  lascivious.’’  Can’t—could  we  give  par-
ents more protection by individual right of action against them? 

Mr.  TRIBE.  If  it’s  obscene  by  the  Court’s  definition,  and  not  pro-

tected speech, you could certainly give parents the right to sue. 

Senator STEVENS. Is that protected speech? 
Mr. TRIBE. I think, probably not. 
Senator STEVENS. Yes, so do I. 
Mr.  TRIBE.  But  an  awful  lot  of  grotesque,  violent  stuff  is  not  ob-
scene  or  sexual,  and  it’s  something  that  we  can  try  to  protect  our 
kids  from  and  that  we  can  encourage  people  not  to  produce.  Sen-
ator Rockefeller, before he left, said, ‘‘This whole problem could just 
be solved if we’d go to the source and we don’t produce it.’’ But, as 
you  pointed  out,  Senator,  when  it’s  pervasively  produced  through-
out  the  world—available  on  the  Internet,  available  to  be 
downloaded  on  iPods,  available  in  video  games—the  idea  that  we 
can simply wipe it out at the source is, I think, an illusion, and we 
fool  ourselves  if  we  don’t  admit  that  the  reason  we’ve  struggled 
with  these  problems  for  so  long  without  making  more  than  incre-
mental headway is that they are fundamentally intractable to gov-
ernment resolution. These are problems of deficient and inadequate 
parenting,  and  I’m  not  talking  about  blaming  parents,  I’m  talking 
about doing whatever we can to empower them. 

When  Senator  Rockefeller  says,  ‘‘Well,  some  parents  have  tele-
visions  that  were  made  before  the  year  2000,  they  don’t  have  the 
V-Chip,’’  well,  that’s  a  self-limiting  problem.  It’s  going  to  go  away. 
It’s a diminishing percentage of—— 

Senator STEVENS. Well, my—— 
Mr. TRIBE.—televisions. 
Senator STEVENS.—time’s up, Professor.

Let  me  just  give  you  an  example.  I  took  my  youngest  daughter 
to  a  movie  one  Saturday  afternoon,  to  see  a  Western  movie  that  I 
thought would be perfectly acceptable. She sat there about 20 min-
utes and said, ‘‘Dad, I’m going home.’’ Someone had called a woman 
in  that  show  a  whore,  and  she  said,  ‘‘I’m  not  going  to  listen  to 
something like that.’’ So, we got up and left. Now, I would say that 
came  from  her  mother’s  influence,  obviously,  and  it’s  the  proper 
way  to  get  the  discipline  into  the  young  people,  is  through  the  in-
fluence of parents. Would you agree? 

Mr. TRIBE. I agree, that’s admirable parenting, Senator. 
Senator STEVENS. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
[Laughter.] 
Senator STEVENS. One parent was wrong, right? 
[Laughter.] 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Lautenberg? 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  Yes,  turn  back  the  clock,  so  we  can  have 

an even start, please. Thank you. 

Mr. Winter, have there been any studies on the effect on children 
of  violent  news—the  war—as  opposed  to  violent  entertainment? 
Are you aware of any? 

Mr.  WINTER.  Not  to  my  knowledge,  Senator.  I  would  have  to 

defer to those scientists here on the panel. 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Anybody—Dr. Kunkel? 
Dr.  KUNKEL.  Yes,  there  certainly  have,  and  they  pose  risks  of 
harm  from—children’s  exposure  to  those  types  of  portrayals,  as 
well. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  How  would  we  control—would  it  be  sug-

gested that we can control that kind of thing? 

Dr.  KUNKEL.  I  think  it’s  a  challenge  to  craft  measures  that  ad-

dress the type of concerns raised by—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. So—— 
Dr. KUNKEL.—TV violence. But I must say—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. OK. 
Dr.  KUNKEL.—that  I’m  troubled—in  Professor  Tribe’s  statement, 

you are—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Well—— 
Dr.  KUNKEL.—you  receive  one  perspective,  and  that  is  the  legal 

challenges that are posed in crafting a—— 

Senator LAUTENBERG. Well, we’re—— 
Dr. KUNKEL.—regulatory solution. 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.  You’re  getting  me  into  a  discussion  that 
you  may  want  to  have  with  Dr.  Tribe  when  you  have  a  moment. 

Dr. KUNKEL. It’s a central issue—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG. He’s a—— 
Dr. KUNKEL.—for this Committee—— 
Senator LAUTENBERG.—distinguished—— 
Dr. KUNKEL.—to confront the harm—— 
Senator  LAUTENBERG.—legal  scholar,  and  I  sometimes  call  him 
for  advice,  not  related  to  this  subject,  but  constitutional  matters, 
and I appreciate—— 

Let  me  ask  you  this,  any  one  of  you.  Is  wrestling  considered  tea 
and crumpets in our society, or is wrestling a form of violent exer-
cise that attracts more and more and more audiences all the time?

I  was  more  of  a  sports  fan  in  an  earlier  life  than  I  am  now,  but 
when  they  took  the  gloves  off  hockey,  hockey  became  a  more  pop-
ular  sport.  And  we  see  evidence  of  violence,  even  in  this  place. 
Even in this place. If you check the language, the vituperation and 
so forth, it is a form of violence. How about violence in the homes? 
Do you know, I wrote a law that banned spousal abusers from get-
ting  gun  permits.  I  had  to  sneak  it  through  on  a  piece  of  must- 
carry  legislation.  It  wouldn’t  have  stood  there  on  its  own.  150,000 
permits have been denied since 1996, when I wrote that law. Now, 
we know very well that the incidence of murder and harm is much 
greater  in  a  house  where  there  is  a  gun  available.  And  yet,  the 
NRA  controls  so  much  of  the  thinking  that  we  go  through  in  this 
House—we can’t pass sensible gun legislation, because we dishonor 
those, purportedly under the Second Amendment. And so, honestly, 
my  friends,  if  I  look  a  little  enraged,  I  hate  that  kind  of  stuff  that 
we  just  saw,  that  evil  stuff,  that  viewing.  And  I  don’t  want  my 
grandchildren  to  be  subjected  to  that,  and  I  don’t  want  anybody’s 
grandchildren to be subjected to that stuff. 

But  don’t  we,  in  a  way,  in—the  way  we  conduct  things,  set  an 
example  that  isn’t  true  at  all,  and  increases,  I  think,  violent  atti-
tudes  between  one  another?  We  took  away  a  mentoring  program 
that  I  had  introduced.  It  was  so  good.  An  hour  or  two  a  week,  at 
the most, mentor a child, talk to him, pat him on the head, say it’s 
good—it  leads  to  remarkable  behavioral  changes.  And  it  was  done 
away with due to—budget reductions. 

So, when I asked, What can we do? Is there a constitutional way 
to  regulate  violent  entertainment  while  protecting  the  independ-
ence  of  news  organizations?  Dr.  Tribe,  is  there  any  way  that  you 
can think of that would do that? 

Mr.  TRIBE.  Senator  Lautenberg,  I  hate  repeating  myself.  The 
only  way  that  I  know,  under  the  Constitution,  is  to  look  at  what 
it  is  that  prevents  kids  from  getting  better  supervision  by  their 
parents,  which  is  not  necessarily  a  national  responsibility,  but 
often  a  State  and  local  one,  and  often  a  matter  of  an  inadequate 
economic  base.  If  you  asked  me  whether  I  believe  that  funding 
some program for patting a little kid on the head will do more good 
in  the  long  run  in  terms  of  violence  than  grandstanding  on  this 
subject  or  more  good  than  passing  a  law  that  then  is  struck  down 
so  you  can  point  at  the  courts  and  say  it’s  their  fault,  then  yes,  I 
think  it  would  do  more  good  to  spend  a  little  money  on  programs 
that are designed to substitute when the kid doesn’t have good par-
enting at home. 

Senator  LAUTENBERG.  It’s  amazing  how  neglectful  parents  are 
when they’re poverty stricken and out to try and get a job, so that 
they can’t sit and regulate the programs, or supervise the programs 
that their children are watching. 

Mr. Chairman, thanks for conducting this hearing. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you, Senator Lautenberg. 
Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank you, witnesses. 
Mr.  Liguori,  you  talked  about  your  TV  rating  system,  that  there 
are  proposals  that  you’re  considering,  to  make  it  better.  Could  you 
discuss those? 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

59 

Mr. LIGUORI. Yes, I can. And I actually thank Mr. Winter for ac-
tually  citing  an  example  of  where  the  industry  needs  to  do  better; 
namely, I think it was the ‘‘NCIS’’ show that failed to have the rat-
ing.  Look,  it  does  seem  fairly  obvious  that  that  was  a  pretty  good 
example of a show that required a V rating. Again, the goal of the 
rating  is  twofold.  One,  very  simply,  on  its  face,  if  one  were  to  see 
a  TV–G,  TV–PG,  TV–7  or  TV–14,  that  they  should  immediately— 
a  parent  should  immediately  know  that  that  may  not  be  appro-
priate  programming  for  their  child.  And,  when  one  programs  their 
V-Chip or their cable or satellite controls, those ratings are, in fact, 
easy to set your TV to. 

The second level is descriptors. We should have a—as consistent 
as  possible,  given  the  difficulties  in  defining  ‘‘violence’’—but,  none-
theless,—in  a  preventative  measure,  it  is  a  little  easier  to  say, 
‘‘Yes, this show has a depiction of violence or sexual content or, po-
tentially,  aggressive  dialogue  or  language.’’  And  those  descriptors 
would  be  attached  to  that  rating,  so,  in  fact,  there  is  an  expla-
nation. 

It  also  serves  as  a  second  filter  for  parents  to  block.  You  could 
block  one  of  two  ways.  You  could  block  via  ratings,  or  you  could 
block  via  descriptors.  And  so,  again,  it  serves  not  only  as  an  infor-
mational  tool,  but  as  a  blocking  tool,  so  that  parents  could  deem 
what is and isn’t appropriate for their particular family. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  You  know,  Senator  Rockefeller  was  asking 
about the ad campaign, the PSA campaign, and I think I saw some 
polls showing it hadn’t really increased V-Chip use. Do you dispute 
that? And can you think of other ways to—— 

Mr. LIGUORI. Well—— 
Senator KLOBUCHAR.—change this? 
Mr.  LIGUORI.—this  is—this  is  where  we’re  at  with  the  ad  cam-
paign.  Currently,  we’ve  spent  about  $146  million  of  the  $300  mil-
lion  that  Mr.  Valenti  raised.  A  couple  of  key  facts.  First,  there  is 
77  percent  awareness  of  this—of  these  PSAs.  And,  just  by  way  of 
example,  when  we,  at  FOX,  and  some  of  the—of  our  other  net-
works, were to look at awareness of a PSA—typically awareness of 
a  PSA  is  anywhere  between  50  and  55  percent—the  Ad  Council 
would  agree  that  77  percent  is  astounding—really  effective  aware-
ness of the campaign. 

Now, there are some preliminary results that show that the cam-
paign  is  beginning  to  take  effect.  Early  indications  show  that  par-
ents  have  gone  from  a  benchmark  of  79  percent  saying  they  have 
a  lot  of  control  over  their  kids’  use  of  TV,  to  almost  85  percent. 
When  you  look  at  total  control,  it’s  gone  up  from  about  25  percent 
to  about  30  percent.  So,  in  fact,  the  campaign,  which  is  just  about 
halfway through, is, in fact, starting to take root. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Was there some Zogby poll—maybe I’ll ask 
Mr.  Winter  to  comment,  though—that  just  showed—and  I  want 
this  to  work,  and,  obviously,  I  think  the  other  issue,  of  course,  is, 
there  are  some  parents  that  are  just  not  going  to  be  able  to  have 
the  time  to  deal  with  all  this  technology,  and  I  hope  we  can  find 
ways  to  do  it  more  simply.  But  I  think  there  was  some  poll  that 
just showed it had gone up 1 percent, or something like that.

60 

Mr. WINTER. Yes, Senator, it did not move outside of the margin 
of  error  of  the  study,  over  the  course  of  several  months—actually, 
9 months. 

Senator  KLOBUCHAR.  So,  are  you  hopeful  that,  when  the  cam-
paign  gets  completed,  we’ll  see  a  change?  I’m  just  looking  at  ways 
for the parents that aren’t going to be able to do this and have the 
time  and  resources  to  figure  it  out—this  is  to  Mr.  Liguori—that 
we’re  going  to  see  better  increases  in  the  use  of  the  V-Chip.  But 
then,  for  these  other  parents,  that  I  saw  a  lot  when  I  was  a  pros-
ecutor,  who  were  just  in  poverty,  it  was  difficult  for  them,  their 
kids were home alone after school, they didn’t have the resources— 
just what we’re going to do to try to protect those kids is what I’m 
looking  at,  and  I’m  trying  to  find  something  that’s  constitutional, 
but that also is—and maybe with some new technology. And that’s 
what I want to hear about some ideas here. 

Anything more you have, Mr. Liguori? I have 36 seconds left. 
Mr.  LIGUORI.  Well,  first  of  all,  I  share  your  hope.  And,  second, 
again,  further  education  is  probably  the  single  best  step  that  we 
can take here. We want to continually make sure that parents have 
aware—are aware of the controls that are available to them. 

And,  look,  I  also  think,  partly,  we  should  be  applauding  some 
parents  here.  There  are  many,  many  parents  who  are  monitoring 
their  kids’  TV  use.  Seventy-three  percent  of  parents  monitor  their 
kids’  TV  use,  84  percent  of  parents  with  kids  under  10  monitor 
their  children’s  TV  use.  It’s  not  100  percent.  My  goal  would  be  to 
get it to be 100 percent. But I don’t think we can discount the most 
widely used and effective method available: parents themselves. 

Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator Dorgan? 

STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, 

U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA 

is  doing 

Senator DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
Mr. Tribe, I, frankly, wasn’t pleased with the implication of your 
suggesting 
is,  quote, 
‘‘grandstanding.’’  Senator  Rockefeller  has  brought  to  this  Com-
mittee, I think, a serious issue. 

this  Committee 

that  what 

Let  me  read  to  you  what  I  wrote  8  years  ago,  in  1999.  Senator 
Hollings, myself, and others were engaged in this issue then. Since 
that time, this problem has gotten worse. 

Let me quote what was in the letter. ‘‘We recognize parents bear 
the  primary  responsibility  for  monitoring  their  child’s  entertain-
ment  and  television  viewing,  but  television  executives  must  also 
bear  some  of  the  responsibility  for  the  programs  they  produce  and 
promote.  We’re  not  asking  them  to  replace  parents,  but,  rather,  to 
help parents, to make their job a bit easier by reducing the amount 
of  violence,  sex,  and  language  in  television  shows.’’  We  suggested 
the reinstating of the family hour, which you have talked about. 

You  know,  look,  in  this  country,  there  is  no  accounting  for  bad 
taste. I turn on television, don’t leave it on long, when I see some-
one  eating  a  bowl  of  maggots  in  some  reality  television  show,  ap-
parently  for  entertainment  purposes.  I  don’t  suggest  that  we  pro-
hibit someone from eating maggots on television. I just think that’s 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

61 

bad  taste.  But  people  have  a  right  to  do  that,  I  guess,  and  a  right 
to film it and show it. 

But I think a consensus with respect to this issue that we’re dis-
cussing  today  is  the  following,  that  the  menu  of  sex  and  violence 
on  television  is  harming  children.  That  was  the  consensus  of  this 
panel,  except  for  one  person.  And,  second,  it  is  not  only  harming 
children, it is increasing. And, with respect to Mr. Tribe’s position, 
there  is  nothing  we  can  do  about  it,  or  at  least  little  we  can  do 
about it, except to say to parents, ‘‘We hope you’ll do a better job.’’ 
Now,  I  don’t  quite  understand  the  circumstance  here.  The  air-
waves over which the television programs are broadcast belong, not 
to  Big  Brother,  Mr.  Tribe,  but  to  the  American  people.  And  your 
reference  to  Big  Brother,  I  suspect,  is  that  instrument  the  Amer-
ican  people  control,  called  ‘‘We,  the  people’’—it’s  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment.  The  airwaves  belong  to  the  American  people.  The  condi-
tions  under  which  those  airwaves  are  used  by  people  to  whom  we 
license  those  airwaves,  seems  to  me,  is  a  perfectly  appropriate 
thing  for  us  to  discuss.  I’m  not  a  big  fan  of  censorship  at  all.  I 
think it moves in the wrong direction. But I do think that we ought 
to  think  seriously  about,  what  are  the  conditions  that  attach  to  li-
censing the airwaves for free use by broadcasters? Should there be 
a  period  of  time  in  which  you  can  expect  the  television  menu  pre-
sented in that home living room, when children are present, would 
have material that is appropriate for that? I think it’s perfectly ap-
propriate for us to be considering that. It is not grandstanding. It’s 
been going on in this Committee for about 10 to 15 years, with vir-
tually no progress. And I commend my colleague for raising it once 
again, because I think this is a serious issue. 

I might just make one other observation. My understanding was, 
the  last  time  we  discussed  this,  when  Teenage  Mutant  Ninja  Tur-
tles was a very popular program in this country, it was filmed two 
separate  ways.  Teenage  Mutant  Ninja  Turtles  was  filmed,  for 
American  viewing  audiences,  with  all  of  the  blows  and  all  of  the 
swinging  of  clubs  and  whatever  they  did,  and  then  it  was  filmed 
a  second  way,  with  most  of  that,  or  much  of  that,  excised,  with  a 
much  less  violent  content  to  it,  because  that’s  what  was  required 
for it to be aired in Europe, particularly Great Britain. 

So,  you  know,  my  point—I’ve  not  asked  questions  here,  but  I’ve 
listened  attentively,  I’ve  read  all  of  the  statements.  I  think  this  is 
a constructive panel. I think it’s an important subject. I don’t think 
it is easy to solve. 

Mr.  Tribe,  I  have  long,  long,  long  respected  you  and  all  of  the 
work  you  do  with  respect  to  the  First  Amendment,  but  you  will,  I 
hope,  understand  my  concern  about  an  implication  of  this  Com-
mittee  grandstanding  when  we  deal  with  an  issue  of  this  impor-
tance,  an  issue  in  which  all  of  us—almost  all  of  us  agree  is  harm-
ing  children,  and  one  in  which  we  wish  we  could  find  a  way,  and 
we  hope  to  continue  to  search  for  a  way,  to  ask  those  who  portray 
this  material  on  television  to  be  thoughtful,  rather  than  thought-
less. 

Now, Mr. Tribe, I’ll give you a chance to respond. 
Mr. TRIBE. Thank you, Senator. 
First of all, I would certainly apologize if I was understood to be 
saying  that  this  Committee  is  grandstanding.  This  Committee  is 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

62 

treating  this  issue  with  utmost  seriousness,  and  I  respect  it  for 
doing that. 

What  I’m  concerned  about  is  a  lot  of  people  who  are  in  favor  of 
doing  something  whether  it  survives  in  the  court  or  not,  and  who, 
unlike this Committee, are not going to dig seriously into the mer-
its  and  into  the  constitutional  issues,  and  who  are  therefore  not 
doing their job, in the way that this Committee is doing it. 

As  far  as  Big  Brother  is  concerned,  I  certainly  agree  that  the 
public airwaves are a public resource, and that licensing the public 
airwaves  through  the  FCC  is  an  important  process,  but  it’s  not  a 
process that gives license to the Government to engage in the cen-
sorship that I think you and I both agree is dangerous. 

If we were to engage in censoring the free, over-the-air broadcast 
system  without  a  similar  program  for  dealing  with  newspapers, 
video  games,  and  cable,  we  would  be  touching  so  small  a  part  of 
the  problem  that  we  would  really  be  making  a  symbolic  gesture 
that wouldn’t affect the large flow of material that our children see. 
Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Tribe,  let  me  ask  you  a  question.  What  if, 
tomorrow,  there  were  a  public  hanging  in  this  country  that  had 
been  through  the  court  system  and  a  defendant  was  ordered 
hanged,  and  it  was  all  right  for  that  jurisdiction  for  it  to  be  tele-
vised? And do you suspect that we would have a rush of those who 
wished to televise it? And do you think it would capture a large au-
dience? And do you think it would be appropriate? 

Mr.  TRIBE.  It  certainly  wouldn’t  be  appropriate.  I  hope  it 
wouldn’t  capture  a  large  audience.  But  I  have  asked  a  final  exam 
question on whether, under current law, it would be permissible to 
black it out, and I don’t really know what the answer is. 

Senator DORGAN. Would free speech—— 
Mr. TRIBE. It would be implicated. 
Senator DORGAN. Would—— 
Mr. TRIBE. But I don’t know the answer to your question. 
Senator  DORGAN.  If  this  country  decided,  ‘‘You  know  what,  we 

don’t want to televise hangings,’’ would that be censorship? 

Mr.  TRIBE.  Well,  if  the  country  decided  to  prevent  the  distribu-

be a form of censorship. It’s a hard question. 

Senator  DORGAN.  You  understand  why  I’m  asking  the  question. 
The  Federal  Communications  Commission  and  the  Congress  have 
some  circumstances  under  which  we  can  establish  conditioning  of

your time is gone over, and Senator Thune has yet to speak. 

Senator  DORGAN.  Mr.  Chairman,  you’re  absolutely  right  I  was 

doing such a great job of——

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA 

so—— 

Senator  THUNE.  I  was  just  entertained  listening,  Mr.  Chairman, 

Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing. 
And  I  want  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  taking  time  out  of  your 
schedules  to  share  your  thoughts  with  us  on  the  issue  of  violence 
in the media. 

I  remember—it  was  sort  of  self-regulating  when  I  was  growing 
up  in  western  South  Dakota.  We  got  one  TV  station.  We  got  the 
CBS network affiliate. And so, ‘‘Gunsmoke,’’ ‘‘The Wild, Wild West,’’ 
were  the  shows  that  we  watched—and  ‘‘Bob  Newhart,’’  and  the 
edgier  ones,  like  ‘‘M*A*S*H’’—at  that  time  was  considered  edgy— 
or  ‘‘Hawaii  5–0,’’  which,  at  that  time,  we  thought  was  a  little  on 
the  edge,  in  terms  of  violence,  and  now,  you  look  back  on  it,  and 
it looks like child’s play compared to what we’re dealing with today. 
And  it  almost  seems  like,  since  that  time,  there  has  kind  of  been 
a  race  to  the  bottom,  in  terms  of  what’s  acceptable  and  the  kind 
of content that we’re exposed to today, and the coarsening that’s oc-
curred in our culture. 

According  to  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation,  81  percent  of  chil-
dren  ages  2  through  7  sometimes  watch  television  without  adult 
supervision,  91  percent  of  children  ages  4  through  6  have  turned 
on the television by themselves. And I guess my question is, where 
are  the  parents  in  this  equation?  Because  I  wholeheartedly  agree 
with  those  who  say  that  there  is  way  too  much  that  comes  across 
the airwaves that is too violent for the eyes and minds of our chil-
dren,  yet  I  also  come  back  to  the  basic  premise  that  there  is  no 
substitute for a responsible parent. 

And, I guess, as we enter into this debate and try and determine 
how best to address, and whether or not there is a role for the Gov-
ernment  to  regulate  this  sort  of  thing,  and  how  it  fits  within  the 
framework  of  the  First  Amendment,  these  are  all  challenging  and 
complex  questions,  and  I  appreciate  some  of  the  light  that’s  been 
shed on those questions today. 

I  would  like  to  ask—pose  a  question  of  Mr.  Tribe,  and  pick  up 
on some of the line of questioning that you’ve responded to already. 
But  Congress  asked  the  FCC  to  look  into  the  issue  of  media  vio-
lence, and, at that time, my understanding was that one of the du-
ties they tasked the FCC with was to come up with a definition of 
‘‘violence’’  that  would  pass  constitutional  muster.  In  the  recent 
April  FCC  report  on  violence,  the  FCC  basically  pushed  that  task 
back  to  the  Congress.  What  is  the  likelihood  of  FCC  or  Congress 
coming  up  with  a  definition  of  ‘‘violence,’’  for  regulatory  purposes, 
that survives in the courts? And, second, how much different would 
this  definition  have  to  be  than  the  definitions  television  content 
providers are using in the current television rating system? 

Mr. TRIBE. Senator, I don’t think it’s likely that a collective body 
like Congress can do a better job than the FCC when it was tasked 
by  Congress  to  come  up  with  proposed  definitions  of  violence.  So, 
although  it  may  seem  like  a  kind  of  pingpong  match,  I  think  that 
one  possibility  is  to  ask  the  FCC  to  do  what  it  claimed  it  thought 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

64 

was doable, but just didn’t want to try doing. It said, ‘‘We know it’s 
difficult to come up with a definition, but we think it can be done.’’ 
And I think there is nothing like demonstrating that it can be done 
to  satisfy  the  curiosity  of  those  of  you  who  think  there  may  be  a 
constitutional definition. 

So far, I have to say, every definition that I’ve seen is subject to 
several  attacks,  all  of  which,  I  think,  are  likely  to  succeed  in  the 
courts.  First,  every  definition  I’ve  seen  is  still  too  vague  for  ordi-
nary people to understand what it means, what it covers, and what 
it  doesn’t  cover.  Does  it  cover  a  certain  scene  from  ‘‘24’’?  Does  it 
cover  the  landing  scenes  in  ‘‘Saving  Private  Ryan’’?  Second,  every 
definition  is  over  broad,  in  that  it’s  going  to  encompass  a  great 
many things that are not hardcore enough to pass muster with the 
Supreme Court. Third every definition has internal inconsistencies. 
We  hear  that  the  more  sanitized  and  the  more  trivialized  a  depic-
tion  of  violence  is—so  that  kids  don’t  know  how  harmful  violence 
can  be—the  more  it’s  likely  to  get  imitated.  On  the  other  hand,  if 
you make these depictions really gruesomely realistic, children are 
going to have nightmares, and that causes another set of problems, 
sort of frightening our kids to death. 

And  so  exceptions  get  made,  or  the  definition  is  like  Swiss 
cheese,  or  we  exempt  news—like  the  coverage  of  a  public  hanging, 
if  it  happens  to  be  news—and  we  exempt  wrestling  and  violent 
sports.  And  once  we  exempt  it  all,  then  our  kids  are  going  to  see 
violence anyway, and we’re not going to make much of a dent. And 
the Supreme Court has said that, when you’re dealing with speech, 
you’ve  got  to  prove  that  you’re  going  to  make  a  real  dent  in  the 
problem in order for it to pass muster. 

So  based  on  any  definition  I’ve  seen,  I  honestly  think  the  likeli-
hood of solving the constitutional problem through the route of cen-
tralized government control is extremely low. But at least the FCC 
could  try  to  come  up  with  something  that  you  could  look  at  and 
test,  rather  than  this  abstraction  of  saying,  ‘‘It’s  difficult,  but  you 
guys try. ‘‘ 

Senator ROCKEFELLER. Senator—— 
Senator THUNE. Yes, sorry. My time up? 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Your—it is. 
Senator  THUNE.  All  right.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Then,  I 

would thank, again, the panel for their testimony.

could, for Mr. Winter. 

Senator  THUNE.  Well,  I  was  just  going  to  ask  a  question,  if  I 

And  this  is  sort  of  a  broad  question,  and  I  don’t—I’d—in  the  in-
terest of time—but, how would you improve the current rating sys-
tem and its application, if you could do that? 

Mr. WINTER. Thank you, Senator, for the question. 
The inherent problem today with the rating system is that those 
who  are  tasked  with  its  success  are  actually  financially  motivated 
for its failure. 

The  conversation  here  today  has  centered  on  something  that  I 
think is inaccurate. The viewer is not the consumer. The viewer is 
the  product.  The  network  sells  the  viewer’s  eyeballs  to  an  adver-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

65 

tiser. The advertiser is truly the consumer when it comes to broad-
cast television, sir. 

Anything that could possibly limit the number of people who are 
watching a show at any one point in time limits the amount of rev-
enue  that  the  broadcast  network  can  earn.  I  spent  most  of  my  ca-
reer, Senator, in the broadcast industry. It is a wonderful industry. 
But  when  you  have  clearly,  here,  an  example  of  the  fox  guarding 
the  henhouse,  the  rating  system,  as  it’s  currently  structured,  can-
not  work.  We  did  a  study,  this  last  April,  that  found,  between  60 
and  80  percent  of  the  time,  the  ratings  are  wrong.  Their  language 
descriptors,  the  violence  descriptors  that  I  mentioned  earlier,  are 
inaccurate. We believe they’re inaccurate because there is financial 
motivation, by those who are rating their own programs, to under-
rate them. It prevents a viewer from turning it off, and it prevents 
an advertiser, who may be mindful of what a program rating is be-
fore they sponsor it, to steer away. 

I  believe  that  there  needs  to  be  an  independent  rating  system. 
I believe it needs to be transparent. The stuff that we saw here on 
this  monitor  this  morning  may  be  rated  TV–14.  It  may  have  a  V 
descriptor.  But  what  we  saw  here  is  not  made  clear  to  a  parent, 
with a little V on the box that comes out of a TV commercial. I be-
lieve there needs to be a universal rating system. Parents are sup-
posed  to  understand  what  a  rating  system  is  when  they  go  to  a 
movie,  versus  when  they  turn  on  the  television,  versus  when  they 
turn  on  the  Internet,  versus  when  they  buy  a  video  game,  versus 
when they buy a music CD. 

And  I  believe,  Senator,  there  should  be  a  consequence  for  inac-
curately  rating  a  program.  Currently,  there  is  no  consequence 
whatsoever  for—either  intentionally  or  accidentally—inaccurately 
rating a program. 

Senator THUNE. Thank you. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. No, thank you very much, Senator Thune. 
I’m going to ask to be entered into the record a statement of Pro-
fessor  Kevin  W.  Saunders,  Ph.D.,  Michigan  State  University  Col-
lege  of  Law,  to  the  U.S.  Senate  Committee  on  Commerce,  on  June 
26, 2007. 

And  I,  again,  want  to  treat  Mr.  Tribe  with  respect  but  when  I 
said ‘‘consultant to,’’ I deliberately left out the word ‘‘paid,’’ and I’m 
now  going  to  read  it—I’m  going  to  insert  that  word,  because  you 
said,  ‘‘I’m  speaking  from  my  heart,’’  but  you  are  being  paid,  by 
cable,  network,  and  movies,  to  be  here.  And  you’re  not  an  officer 
of  the  Cabinet,  so  that  you’re  not  being  censored  by  OMB,  you’re 
not being told what can be said. But that needs to be on the record. 
And, for that reason, I want this and do say it without dissent, that 
an view of another law professor will be placed in the record.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR KEVIN W. SAUNDERS, J.D., PH.D., 

MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LAW 

I  want  to  thank  the  Committee  for  this  opportunity  to  share  my  thoughts  on  the 
protection  of  children  from  violent  television  programming.  I  am  Senior  Associate 
Dean  for  Academic  Affairs  and  Professor  of  Law  at  Michigan  State  University  Col-
lege  of  Law,  where  I  specialize  in  constitutional  law  and  in  particular  the  First 
Amendment.  I  have  spent  the  past  dozen  years  studying  the  constitutional  issues

surrounding  attempts  to  limit  the  access  of  children  to  depictions  of  violence  and 
to  other  negative  media  influences.  I  am  the  author  of  two  books  addressing  the 
topic, Violence as Obscenity: Limiting the Media’s First Amendment Protection 1 and 
Saving Our Children from the First Amendment,2 and numerous law review articles. 
I  will  discuss  the  issue  in  the  context  of  the  Federal  Communications  Commis-
sion’s  April,  2007  Report.3 The  Report  first  recognizes  the  impact  of  violent  media 
on  children,  and  recognizes  that  despite  criticism  from  media  groups  and  a  small 
number  of  scientists,  the  scientific  and  health  community  has  concluded  that  there 
is a negative impact. This sort of evidence has not yet convinced courts that a com-
plete  ban  on  children’s  access  to  violent  video  games  is  justified,  with  the  courts 
often  demonstrating  a  skepticism  regarding,  or  an  inability  to  understand,  statis-
tical  studies.  In  the  context  of  the  broadcast  media,  the  test  may  be  less  stringent. 
As  the  FCC  notes  in  its  Report,  the  Supreme  Court  has  stated  a  test  for  broadcast 
regulation  that  seems  somewhat  short  of  the  strictest  scrutiny.  In  FCC  v.  League 
of Women Voters the Court said regarding television ‘‘restrictions have been upheld 
only  when  we  were  satisfied  that  the  restriction  is  narrowly  tailored  to  further  a 
substantial  governmental  interest,  such  as  ensuring  adequate  and  balanced  cov-
erage  of  public  issues.’’ 4 Thus,  scientific  results  found  insufficient  in  one  context 
might be seen as sufficient in the arena of the broadcast media.5 

Rather  than  take  that  approach,  I  will  discuss  the  recommendations  that  violent 
programming be channeled into hours when children are less likely to be in the au-
dience in comparison to the FCC’s limitations on sexual indecency. The foundational 
case  in  this  area  is  FCC  v.  Pacifica  Foundation,6 which  grew  out  of  an  afternoon 
broadcast of humorist George Carlin’s ‘‘Filthy Words’’ monologue, words Carlin said 
you could never, ever say on the air. The FCC took the position not that the words 
could  never  be  said  but  that  they  could  only  be  used  in  hours  when  children  are 
less  likely  to  be  listening.  The  Supreme  Court  found  statutory  authority  to  require 
this channeling of indecent material and also found no violation of the First Amend-
ment.  The  broadcast  media  were  seen  to  enjoy  lesser  First  Amendment  protection 
than other media, because of the pervasive presence of the broadcast media, the fact 
that  the  broadcast  media  confront  us  in  our  homes  and  not  just  in  public,  and  the 
accessibility  of  broadcasts  to  youth,  even  to  children  too  young  to  read.  Warnings 
were seen as inadequate for those who tuned in after they were broadcast, and turn-
ing off the broadcast after hearing the indecent material was said not to be an ade-
quate  remedy.  The  only  solution  was  channeling.  In  a  series  of  cases,  the  United 
States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  eventually  established 
limits that channel indecency into the period of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.7 

The  major  issue  raised  by  an  attempt  to  protect  children  from  the  broadcast  of 
violent  programming  is  whether  Pacifica  addresses  only  sexual  indecency  or  may 
apply  to  violence  as  well.  The  language  of  the  statute  at  issue  in  Pacifica  may  be 
broad  enough  to  include  violence.  The  statutory  prohibition  was  against  the  broad-
cast  of  ‘‘indecent’’  material.  While  Pacifica  Foundation  maintained  that  ‘‘indecent’’ 
meant ‘‘obscene,’’ the Court said that ‘‘indecent’’ meant not in conformance with ‘‘ac-
cepted  standards  of  morality.’’ 8 Under  such  a  broad  reading,  indecency  can  include 
violence,  at  least  if  the  material  does  not  conform  to  generally  accepted  standards 
of  morality.  In  any  case,  legislation  authorizing  the  FCC  similarly  to  limit  violence 
would resolve any statutory issue. 

In  addition  to  the  statutory  concerns  growing  out  of  Pacifica,  there  is  the  impor-
tant issue of whether the First Amendment analysis that justified the decision there 
carries  over  to  violence.  The  pervasiveness,  presence  in  the  home  and  accessibility 
to  children  that  spoke  in  favor  of  limiting  sexual  indecency  are  of  equal  concern 
when the material is violent. The argument that Pacifica can not carry over to vio-
lence  finds  its  best  statement  in  an  article  by  Professors  Krattenmaker  and  Powe 
published shortly after the Pacifica decision.9 They concluded that Pacifica must be 
limited to sexual material. They examined the decision against a background of Su-
preme Court cases regarding the First Amendment rights of children and concluded 
that, unless the Court was implicitly overruling several of those decisions, the inde-
cency the First Amendment allows the FCC to regulate must be conceptually related 
to  obscenity.  For  them  the  material  subject  to  channeling  must  have  the  character 
of obscene material without necessarily reaching the level of explicitness and offen-
siveness needed to be legally obscene. Thus, in their view, Pacifica is limited to sex-
ual material. 

There  are  two  responses  to  Krattenmaker’s  and  Powe’s  argument.  The  first  is  to 
conclude  that,  while  the  Court  may  not  have  intended  to  overrule  the  decisions 
Krattenmaker and Powe cite at the time of Pacifica, the strength of those decisions 
has  lessened  to  the  point  that  Pacifica  can  now  apply  to  violence.  The  major  case 
recognizing  First  Amendment  rights  in  children,  and  one  heavily  relied  on  in  the 
article, is Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District.10 That case

67 

did recognize that children have First Amendment rights and that those rights even 
apply,  with  certain  limitations,  in  school.  Krattenmaker  and  Powe  saw  Tinker  as 
limiting the application of case law approving restrictions on the distribution of ma-
terial to children to sexual material.11 

Tinker may no longer have the vitality it had at the time Krattenmaker and Powe 
wrote  their  article.  While  the  Court  upheld  student,  and  hence  child,  speech  rights 
in the political context of a Vietnam War protest there, in later cases the Court has 
allowed  restrictions  in  the  schools.12 Tinker  may  be  seen  as  a  high  point  for  the 
First  Amendment  rights  of  children,  with  any  retreat  by  the  Court  weakening  the 
argument  offered  by  Krattenmaker  and  Powe.  In  Saving  Our  Children  from  the 
First  Amendment,  I  argue  that  Tinker  was  actually  about  not  allowing  the  schools 
to  be  used  to  skew  a  real  debate  in  the  adult  community.  One  side  in  the  Vietnam 
War  debate  could  not  be  allowed  to  express  its  view  while  not  allowing  expression 
by the other. When it came to a nomination speech full of sexual innuendo in Bethel 
School  District  v.  Fraser 13 or  what  the  principal  saw  as  unsuitable  articles  on  di-
vorce  and  teenage  pregnancy  in  Hazelwood  School  Dist.  v.  Kuhlmeier,14 children’s 
rights  did  not  prevail.  To  the  degree  that  the  combination  of  plurality,  concurring 
and  dissenting  opinions  in  Island  Trees  Union  Free  School  Dist.  v.  Pico 15 provide 
guidance, that guidance again focuses on political skewing in the choice of books to 
be removed from the school library. 

If Tinker has eroded or is limited as suggested above, the argument that Pacifica 
is  limited  to  material  that  approaches  being  obscene  is  weakened.  Even  if 
Krattenmaker and Powe were correct at the time of their article, it may now be con-
stitutional  to  limit  the  access  of  minors  to  violence  by  requiring  the  channeling  of 
broadcast violence. The discussion of the Tinker line of cases is only one part of Sav-
ing  Our  Children  from  the  First  Amendment,  and  the  entirety  of  the  book’s  argu-
ment speaks to the issue before the Committee. The thesis of the book is that there 
should be a two tier First Amendment. The protection of expression between adults 
should be fully robust, perhaps more robust than it is at present. At the same time, 
adult  expression  rights  do  not  include  the  right  to  express  oneself  to  other  people’s 
children. 

Free  expression  certainly  has  great  value.  It  is  essential  to  self-government.  It 
also  is  a  part  of  the  protection  of  the  individual’s  autonomy  interests  in  choosing 
the  sort  of  person  he  or  she  wants  to  be.  There  are,  of  course,  also  costs.  The  vio-
lence  concern  has  already  been  discussed,  but  there  are  also  concerns  over  racist 
or  sexist  expression  and  over  the  effects  of  advertising.  On  balance,  the  dangers  of 
government interference in the political process and our beliefs regarding autonomy 
lead  to  the  conclusion  that  adult  to  adult  expression  should  be  strongly  protected. 
The balance should be different for children. The costs when children are involved 
are  greater.  Children  are  still  in  the  process  of  developing.  Neuroscientists  are 
learning  that  even  teenagers  are  undergoing  structural  changes  in  the  area  of  the 
brain  that  governs  judgment  and  inhibition.  Negative  influences  of  media  on  chil-
dren may then be far stronger than any negative effects experienced by adults. 

The benefits of free expression are also lessened when the issue is the availability 
of expression to children. Children don’t play the same active role in self-governance 
that  adults  do,  so  free  expression  for  them  is  not  crucial  to  the  political  system. 
Children  will  eventually  need  to  be  competent  voters,  and  as  they  approach  major-
ity,  they  should  have  more  access  to  information  and  must  learn  to  participate  in 
political  debate.  But,  these  training  interests  should  not  have  the  same  dimensions 
as adult interests in free expression. There is also less commitment to autonomy for 
children;  we  simply  do  not  assume  them  competent  to  make  all  their  own  life  style 
decisions.  We  limit  their  access  to  cigarettes  and  alcohol,  while  allowing  adults  to 
decide  for  themselves  whether  or  not  to  smoke  or  drink.  Even  the  founding  liber-
tarian John Stuart Mill recognized that children are different. He gave as a reason 
why the state should not punish adult self-regarding behavior the fact that the state 
had  all  of  the  person’s  childhood  to  instill  rules  of  proper  behavior  and  should  not 
punish those it failed to teach.16 

If  the  First  Amendment  rights  of  children  are  weaker  than  those  of  adults,  the 
government  should  have  the  right  to  limit  their  access  to  depictions  of  violence. 
Channeling of violent broadcasts would be an appropriate mechanism in furtherance 
of  that  interest.  Pacifica  recognized  channeling  as  a  proper  balance  of  adult  rights 
to  hear  the  indecent  material  at  issue  there.  If  there  is  the  same  right  to  limit  ac-
cess  to  violence,  the  same  balancing  should  allow  channeling  requirements  for  vio-
lence. 

The  particular  relevance  to  this  issue  of  Violence  as  Obscenity:  Limiting  the  Me-
dia’s  First  Amendment  Protection  is  as  a  response  to  Krattenmaker  and  Powe,  if 
they  are  correct  in  their  conclusion  that  the  indecency  the  FCC  may  require  chan-
neled  must  be  related  to  the  obscene.  The  thesis  of  that  book  is  that  the  focus  of

the obscenity exception to the First Amendment on sexual depictions is too narrow. 
It is the product of Victorian Age concerns over sex, and an analysis of the concept, 
a longer term view of the case law, and an examination of the policy arguments that 
justify the obscenity exception all speak just as well to violence as to sex. If violence, 
regardless of sexual content, may be obscene, lesser degrees of violence may be inde-
cent, as the term is used in Pacifica, and may be channeled. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  Supreme  Court  has  never  stated  that  obscenity 
may  not  be  based  on  violence,  independently  of  sex.  There  is  language  in  cases  in-
volving  sexual  material  that  says  for  such  material  to  be  obscene  it  must  be  erotic. 
But,  in  those  cases  the  Court  was  concerned  with  distinguishing  sexual  depictions 
that  are  obscene  from  other  sexual  depictions  or  from  the  use  of  words  that  may 
have  a  sexual  use  in  other  contexts.17 The  relevance  of  those  cases  to  violence  is 
minimal. The only Supreme Court case directly addressing the regulation of violence 
is Winters v. New York.18 There the Court found the statute at issue unconstitution-
ally  vague  but  specifically  warned  against  reading  the  result  as  a  conclusion  that 
violence could not be regulated under a properly drawn statute. 

Turning  to  the  ordinary  language  concept  of  the  obscene,  the  extension  of  the 
word  is  clearly  broader  than  sex,  reaching  even  such  uses  as  a  corporation  making 
‘‘obscene  profits.’’  A  reasonable  limiting  construction  that  still  includes  violence  is 
found in a suggested derivation of the word from ab scaena or ‘‘off the stage,’’ refer-
ring  to  material  that  cannot  be  shown  on  stage.  Viewed  from  that  perspective  and 
over  the  long  term,  violence  has  as  much  claim  to  the  label  as  sex.  The  classical 
Greek  theater  prohibited  the  depiction  of  homicide  on  stage.19 While  a  killing  that 
occurred  off  stage  could  be  described  in  great  deal  on  stage  and  a  person  could  die 
of  natural  causes  or  be  struck  down  by  the  gods  or  commit  suicide,  homicide  could 
not  be  shown  on  the  stage.  At  the  same  time,  there  was  a  toleration  of  sexual  dia-
logue  and  the  on-stage  portrayal  of  sexual  excitement  and  nudity.20 The  theater  of 
early Rome shared these Greek values, and while later Roman theater allowed vio-
lence  to  the  degree  of  actual  killings,  it  also  allowed  the  actual  performance  of  on- 
stage  sexual  acts.21 The  relative  treatment  of  sex  and  violence  has  varied  from  age 
to age. While the Middle Age mystery plays were quite violent, in some eras enter-
tainment  was  very  sexual,  extending  to  animal  and  even  human  copulation  for  the 
entertainment of an audience.22 Historically, sex has no exclusive claim to the label 
‘‘obscene.’’ 

Ordinary language analysis only takes us so far, and what is of real historical im-
portance  is  the  law’s  treatment  of  the  obscene  in  constitutionally  relevant  eras. 
When the Supreme Court first recognized the obscenity exception it cited a long his-
tory  of  cases  and  statutes  dating  back  to  the  constitutional  era.23 In  that  history 
it  is  important  to  note  the  lack  of  a  focus  on  sex.  In  Professor  Schauer’s  review  of 
the  history  of  obscenity  law,24 he  concludes  that  in  American  law  the  sole  focus  of 
obscenity  on  sex  did  not  develop  until  the  1986  Supreme  Court  decision  in 
Swearingen  v.  United  States.25 This  Victorian  Era,  post-14th  Amendment  focus  is 
the  product  of  a  constitutionally  irrelevant  period.  If  the  law  in  the  constitutional 
era  and  14th  Amendment  era  left  obscene  material  unprotected,  as  the  Court  con-
cluded,  it  should  be  what  was  considered  obscene  in  those  eras,  and  not  the  more 
limited Victorian concept, that is denied First Amendment protection. 

It is also interesting to note that the late 1800s limitation on the use of the word 
‘‘obscene’’  was  not  accompanied  by  a  change  in  the  desire  to  regulate  other  depic-
tions  that  would  formerly  have  been  labeled  ‘‘obscene.’’  The  New  York  organization 
established  by  the  anti-obscenity  crusader  Anthony  Comstock  also  led  the  effort  to 
prohibit  the  distribution  of  ‘‘any  book,  newspaper  or  other  printed  paper  devoted  to 
the  publication,  or  principally  made  up  of  criminal  news,  police  reports  or  accounts 
of  criminal  deeds  or  pictures  and  stories  of  deeds  of  bloodshed,  lust  or  crime.’’ 26 
While  this  was  the  statute  Winters  held  unconstitutionally  vague,  it  does  reflect  a 
concern  that  was  shared  by  a  majority  of  the  states  in  that  era,  as  shown  by  nine-
teen  nearly  identical  and  four  substantially  similar  statutes.27 The  history  of  deny-
ing protection to violent material is then, until the most recent era, as long as that 
for  sexual  material.  If  legal  history  justifies  the  obscenity  exception,  it  justifies  an 
exception that reaches violence as well as sex. 

It  is  also  important  to  examine  briefly  the  policies  offered  as  justification  for  the 
First Amendment and the obscenity exception. If the amendment protected only po-
litical  speech  or  material  advocating  social  change,  the  exception  both  with  regard 
to  sex  and  to  violence  would  be  justified,  since  material  with  serious  value  cannot 
be  considered  obscene.  Professor  Schauer’s  ‘‘Free  Speech  Principle’’  is  broader  but 
still  requires  communication,  and  he  justifies  placing  the  hardest  core  pornography 
in  the  obscenity  exception  because  he  says  it  is  noncommunicative,  is  nonspeech, 
and  is  no  more  worthy  of  First  Amendment  protection  than  would  be  a  mechanical 
sex  aid.28 His  objection  to  protecting  sexually  obscene  materials  appears  to  be  that

the  brain  is  not  their  real  audience.  They  have  a  visceral,  rather  than  a  cognitive 
or  emotional,  response.  Music  and  romantic  literature  may  stimulate,  but  they  do 
so through the higher order functions of the brain. He views the brain as a superior 
audience  to  the  genitals.  The  brain  should  also  be  considered  a  superior  audience 
to  the  adrenals,  and  there  seems  to  be  no  reason  to  prefer  one  portion  of  the  endo-
crine system over the other. If depictions arc violent enough to have a hormonal ef-
fect,  Schauer’s  analysis  would  seem  also  to  exclude  them  from  the  First  Amend-
ment’s protection. 

There  are  First  Amendment  theories  that  argue  against  the  existence  of  the  ob-
scenity  exception.  But  since  the  obscenity  exception  is  a  part  of  the  law,  the  more 
interesting theories are those that justify it. Each of those theories also justifies an 
exception for violent obscenity.29 Given the legal history, the ordinary language con-
cept,  and  the  inability  to  distinguish  the  two  under  First  Amendment  theory,  the 
law  should  allow  a  refocusing  of  the  obscenity  exception  to  include  violence.  That 
recognition of violent obscenity should be accompanied by a further recognition that 
violent  material  may  also  be  indecent.  As  such,  it  can  come  within  the  analysis  of 
Pacifica, and the FCC may be authorized or directed to channel it into hours when 
children are less likely to be in the television audience. 

It must be admitted that this obscenity argument has enjoyed only limited success 
since being offered in Violence as Obscenity. In a recent case growing out of an Indi-
anapolis attempt to prevent minors from playing violent games in video arcades, the 
Federal  district  court,  in  American  Amusement  Machine  Ass’n  v.  Kendrick,30 used 
the  theory  in  refusing  to  enjoin  enforcement  of  the  ordinance.  However,  when  the 
District  Court  decision  was  appealed  to  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 
Seventh  Circuit,  an  opinion  by  Judge  Posner  rejected  the  inclusion  of  depictions  of 
violence  within  the  category  of  the  obscene,  concluding  that  the  two  are  ‘‘distinct 
categories  of  objectionable  depiction,’’ 31 and  other  courts  have  followed  Judge 
Posner. In Judge Posner’s view, obscenity is restricted because the community finds 
it offensive, while there is not a similar offensiveness in violent material and restric-
tions  are  motivated  by  concern  over  dangerousness.  It  is,  however,  not  at  all  clear 
that  those  concerned  over  sexually  obscene  materials  are  concerned  solely  out  of 
some  sense  of  offense.  Furthermore,  there  would  seem  to  be  something  flawed  in 
a person or society offended by depictions of sexuality but failing to find any offense 
in explicit depictions of great violence. That is, however, not in fact our society. 

A study that exposed a population in the Memphis, Tennessee area to sexual and 
to violent films and surveyed their reactions speaks to the issue.32 The sexual films 
were  selected  based  on  obscenity  prosecutions  indicating  prosecutor  beliefs  that  the 
films  violated  community  standards  for  offensiveness,  and  the  violent  films  were  of 
the ‘‘slasher’’ variety. The participants were asked to assess the films both in terms 
of  whether  they  found  the  films  acceptable  and  also  whether  they  though  the  com-
munity found them acceptable. In summarizing the results, the study concludes that 
the adults found the sexual films not to be patently offensive, while the violent films 
were seen as exceeding their standards for offensiveness. What is particularly inter-
esting is that, while the participants found the violent films offensive, they believed 
that  others  in  the  community  tolerated  the  materials,  while  in  another  cited  study 
the  sample  found  the  sexual  materials  not  to  be  offensive  but  believed  the  commu-
nity  thought  them  to  be  offensive.  If  those  results  accurately  represent  the  popu-
lation, then the participants, and Judge Posner, must be wrong. People find violence 
offensive  but  think  their  community  does  not.  But  they  are  the  community,  or  are 
representative of it, so the real situation is that the community in a sense finds vio-
lence offensive but thinks that it does not. That is, the average person finds the ma-
terial  offensive  but  believes  himself  or  herself  to  be  out  of  step  with  public  senti-
ment.  To  the  contrary  with  sexual  material;  the  average  person  does  not  take  of-
fense but believes that other members of the community are offended. Judge Posner, 
whether  he  does  or  does  not  personally  find  violent  depictions  offensive,  may  have 
failed  to  recognize  the  degree  to  which  the  public  does  find  such  images  offensive. 
Turning,  last,  to  the  issue  of  requiring  that  cable  systems  allow  a  channel  by 
channel  selection  of  the  programming  that  parents  allow  into  their  homes,  there 
would  seem  to  be  little  in  the  way  of  First  Amendment  concern.  Such  a  rule  would 
be  in  the  realm  of  business  regulation  and  protects  the  consumer  from  a  form  of 
product tying that requires buying cable services in packages or tiers. It is not con-
tent  based.  Some  will  refuse  to  buy  channels  perceived  as  conveying  more  violent 
fare,  others  will  choose  not  to  receive  sports  programming,  and  others  will  reject 
decorating  and  home  improvement  programming.  All  the  FCC  proposes  doing  is  to 
allow  the  individual  consumer  to  determine  what  comes  into  hie  or  her  home.  The 
government offers no regulatory pronouncements as to what is suitable to what au-
dience.

While  the  case  arose  in  the  context  of  limits  on  mailing  commercial  material  to 
recipients  who  found  the  material  objectionable,  the  Court  in,  Rowan  v.  United 
States Post Office Dept.,33 offered insights that speak to this issue as well. 

736  [T]he  right  of  every  person  ‘to  be  let  alone’  must  be  placed  in  the  scales 
with  the  right  of  others  to  communicate. . . .  Weighing  the  highly  important 
right  to  communicate,  but  without  trying  to  determine  where  it  fits  into  con-
stitutional  imperatives,  against  the  very  basic  right  to  be  free  from  sights, 
sounds, and tangible matter we do not want, it seems to us that a mailer’s *737 
right  to  communicate  must  stop  at  the  mailbox  of  an  unreceptive  ad-
dressee. . . . 

To hold less would tend to license a form of trespass and would make hard-
ly  more  sense  than  to  say  that  a  radio  or  television  viewer  may  not  twist  the 
dial  to  cutoff  an  offensive  or  boring  communication  and  thus  bar  its  entering 
his  home.  Nothing  in  the  Constitution  compels  us  to  listen  to  or  view  any  un-
wanted  communication,  whatever  its  merit;  we  see  no  basis  for  according  the 
printed  word  or  pictures  a  different  or  more  preferred  status  because  they  are 
sent  by  mail.  The  ancient  concept  that  ‘a  man’s  home  is  his  castle’  into  which 
‘not even the king may enter’ has lost none of its vitality, and none of the recog-
nized  exceptions  includes  any  right  to  communicate  offensively  with  an-
other. . . . 

We  therefore  categorically  reject  the  argument  that  a  vendor  has  a  right 
under  the  Constitution  or  otherwise  to  send  unwanted  material  into  the  home 
of  another.  If  this  prohibition  operates  to  impede  the  flow  of  even  valid  ideas, 
the answer is that no one has a right to press even ‘good’ ideas on an unwilling 
recipient.  That  we  are  often  ‘captives’  outside  the  sanctuary  of  the  home  and 
subject to objectionable speech and other sound does not mean we must be cap-
tives  everywhere. . . .  The  asserted  right  of  a  mailer,  we  repeat,  stops  at  the 
outer boundary of every person’s domain.34 

While  cable  television  is  not  commercial  in  the  same  sense  as  mailed  advertise-
ments,  the  reasoning  rings  true.  The  right  of  the  cable  system  to  provide  channels 
ends  at  the  viewer’s  cable  box.  So  long  as  the  government  is  not  setting  the  limits, 
it may provide a mechanism by which the customer can.

5 There are stronger reasons to be concerned over violence than over sexual inde-
cency  on  television.  There  appears  to  be  little  evidence  of  physical  or  psychological 
harm growing out of the exposure of youth to sexual indecency. This lack of evidence 
is probably due to ethical, and legal, concerns over exposing children to such mate-
rial  to  study  the  effects.  In  contrast,  there  is  strong  evidence  of  negative  physical 
and  psychological  effects  from  exposure  to  violent  material.  There  is  a  vast  body  of 
research  demonstrating  a  connection  between  media  violence  and  real  world  vio-
lence.  Six  major  professional  organizations  in  the  health  fields  have  found  the 
science  conclusive.  In  a  joint  statement  to  a  July,  2000  congressional  public  health 
summit,  the  American  Psychological  Association,  the  American  Academy  of  Pediat-
rics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Med-
ical  Association,  the  American  Academy  of  Family  Physicians,  and  the  American 
Psychiatric  Association  concluded  that  ‘‘well  over  1,000  studies  . . .  point  over-
whelmingly  to  a  causal  connection  between  media  violence  and  aggressive  behavior 
in  some  children.’’  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  et  al.,  Joint  Statement  on  the

lic  Health  Summit  (July  26,  2000),  available  at  www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/ 
jstmevc.htm).  While  the  entertainment  industry  may  dispute  the  connection,  as  to-
bacco executives continued to deny the connection between tobacco and lung cancer, 
the  scientific  community  has  come  to  a  conclusion.  That  conclusion  provides  more 
justification for concern over exposing children to violence than for exposure to sex-
ual indecency.

nature of things or what circumstances would dictate as right or expected or appro-

Senator  ROCKEFELLER.  This,  to  me,  has  been  an  interesting  ses-
sion—I’m  going  to  come  to  you,  Senator  Klobuchar—interesting 
session, because it’s exactly like all the other ones we’ve heard. All 
the questions have gone to Mr. Tribe, which I think, is predictable. 
The questions that have gone to you, Mr. Liguori, I could have an-
swered  the  questions  as  you  did,  because  I  knew  exactly  what  you 
were going to say, because that’s what you’ve got to say. The people 
who deal—in a sense, this has almost wandered away from a hear-
ing  about  children,  you  know,  it’s  become  sort  of  a  discussion  of 
American society. It is not. This is a hearing about the effect of vio-
lence and indecency, all the rest of it, on small children. And that’s 
only  what  it’s  about.  People  have  had  a  chance  to  talk  about  a  lot 
of other things, among those being parental responsibility. 

And,  of  course,  I  agree  with  parental  responsibility,  and  what  I 
think—and  I  think  that  Senator  Klobuchar  was  thinking  of  some

of this. Our only daughter is a special-ed teacher, and she has been 
working in Jackie Robinson Junior High School, on 116th Street in 
New York, at a junior high school there, and—that’s a 100 percent 
nonwhite  student  body—and  they  did  a  very  interesting  thing,  be-
cause a lot of the children were disruptive in class, and they want-
ed to know why. So, rather than punishing the student on the spot, 
they made each of the teachers, on a monthly basis for a period of 
at least a year, go to the homes of those individual students, where, 
for  the  most  part,  teachers  found  no  parents,  parents  who  were 
strung out on drugs, parents who were engaged in other activities, 
for the most part, parents who simply were not there. That’s a dra-
matic inner city example. 

I don’t know if any of you gentlemen have ever been to West Vir-
ginia  before,  but  one  does  not  find  an  abundance  of  either 
broadband  or  many  other  things  that  are  part  of  the  larger  urban 
world, especially in the rural parts of West Virginia. I was a VISTA 
volunteer there for 2 years. And, granted, that was some time ago, 
but  the  whole  concept  of  a  parent  being  able  to  enforce  a  V-Chip, 
had there been one at the time, is absolutely absurd. It’s absolutely 
absurd. Parents don’t take the time to do that, because parents are 
under  unbelievable  pressure  in  their  lives.  And  often,  parents  are 
watching  with  the  children,  which  brings  in  another  dimension 
about parental responsibility. 

I  agree  with  parental  responsibility,  but  unless  you  can  show 
that  parental  responsibility  works,  then,  it  seems  to  me,  we  have 
to try something else. 

Now,  the  answer  here,  roundly,  with  the  exception  of  several  of 
our  witnesses,  has  been  that  there  is  nothing,  really,  we  can  do. 
And the difference between—what was it—causal effect and—what-
ever the other legal term was. And so, we immediately get lost into 
the  world  of,  ‘‘What  can  we  do?’’  There  can  be  no  answer  that  will 
pass muster in the Supreme Court, or in the courts. 

And,  see,  that’s  been  the  pattern.  I  was  with  Senator  Dorgan, 
working on this, starting a dozen years ago, with Senator Hollings. 
And I continue working on it, and I’ll continue—I’ll keep on, for as 
long  as  I’m  here.  It’s  a  devastating  problem.  To  point  at  parents, 
and  to  have  the  head  of  FOX—or  whatever  your  position  is,  Mr. 
Liguori—to  say  that  the  problem  is  the  parents,  strikes  me  as  an 
inordinately repulsive statement. You’re the one—and I think that, 
Mr. Winter, you’ve hit it on the nail—his audience is not the child, 
his  audience  is  the  advertiser.  He’s  got  to  sell  the  program  to  the 
advertiser  to  make  sure  that  the  advertiser  puts  up  the  money  so 
he  can  put  the  program  on.  And  I  think  that’s  the  history  of  tele-
vision. 

Television  used  to  self-regulate  quite  well,  up  until  about  1992, 
and then, all of a sudden it just went straight downhill, and it has 
stayed so. 

And  so,  I  will  conclude  my  statement  with  the  statement  that 
Eddie Fritts, then head of the National Association of Broadcasters, 
said,  3  years  ago:  ‘‘The  National  Association  of  Broadcasters  be-
lieves  that  voluntary  industry  initiatives  are  preferable  to  govern-
ment regulation when dealing with the program issues, just releas-
ing a number’’—et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

Well,  of  course  that’s  what  he’s  going  to  say.  Of  course  that’s 
what  he’s  going  to  do—going  to  promulgate.  Of  course  Jack 
Valenti’s farcical $250 million—which was not, incidentally, money, 
but  it  was  just  money  taken  away  from  television  advertising,  so 
it  wasn’t  even  a  donation,  which  it  was  made  out  to  be.  It  doesn’t 
have  any  effect.  Americans  don’t  remember  things  for  long  periods 
of time, and they don’t know technology well. 

To  me,  the  saddest  part  about  what  I  think  has  been  a  very  in-
teresting  hearing,  but  very  frustrating,  from  my  point  of  view,  has 
been  that  the  three  people  who  have  studied  this  from—in  terms 
of  Mr.  Winter,  Dr.  Kunkel,  Mr.  McIntyre—who  have  studied  this 
from  the  point  of  view  of  the  effects,  on  children,  of  violence  and 
indecency, has been relatively not discussed. You have discussed it. 
Others have not. The panel has relatively not discussed it. 

That’s what we’re talking about. We’re not talking about 30-year- 
olds  or  60-year-olds  or  whether  Senator  Lautenberg  is  repulsed  or 
not,  or  whether  Senator  Sununu  thinks  that  putting  something  on 
at  10:35,  which—at  least  it  got  our  attention,  that  was  the  point 
of  it—the  point  is,  it’s  about  little  children,  whose  brains  are  en-
tirely  formed  by  the  time  they  are  5  years  old,  and  whose  habits 
are  clearly  forming  as  they  enter  into  their  teen  years.  This  is  ex-
actly what we’re talking about, and only what we’re talking about. 
So  that  the  three  people,  I  think,  who  know  the  most  about  that 
are the three people who received the fewest questions. And I think 
that is, in a sense, symbolic of the race for the bottom and the race 
for the dollar in our society. 

Senator Klobuchar? 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. 
And thank you, to our panelists. 
I will say that I’m focused here on some of these kids whose par-
ents might not have the resources to figure out the V-Chip. I’ll tell 
you,  in  my  own  life,  my  husband  and  I  have—our  TV,  the  volume 
is so low, we can’t get it higher, that we have to turn the air-condi-
tioning off to watch it, and we don’t have time to fix it yet. It’s been 
like that for about a month. And I think about these other parents 
who have a lot less resources than us. So, I struggle here with try-
ing to help these parents, and—who I think want to be responsible 
for their kids—to find the easiest way to do this. 

And  the  answer,  to  me,  is  that  we  have  to  educate,  as  much  as 
possible, and then we have to see if we can be creative about doing 
this in the right way, because I really don’t want to pass something 
that  we  believe  is  going  to  be  thrown  out  in  court,  just  to  do  that. 
And  so,  I’m,  you  know,  looking  at  this  a´ la  carte  option,  which 
I  think  is  problematic.  I  think  you  kind  of  squeeze  one  end  of  the 
water  balloon,  and  then  you  have  problems  on  the  other  end.  I 
know  there  are  concerns  from  the  religious  and  minority  broad-
casters  on  this,  and  that’s  why  I  keep  going  back  to  push  Mr. 
Liguori  and  the  industry  on  the  technological  possibilities  that  we 
could  put  in  place  here  to  help  parents;  to  make  it  easier  when 
they  order  their  systems  or  whether  they  know  for  sure  there  is  a 
certain time band. And I know that this has been tried before, and 
found  unconstitutional.  But  I  just  ask—this  is  my  first  hearing  on 
this  subject,  I  know  there  have  been  a  lot  of  other  ones  in  the 
past—but  we  are  a  smart  country,  we’ve  been  able  to  develop

things.  We  know  that  violence  has  this  effect  on  kids.  I’ve  seen  it, 
as a prosecutor. We’d always use the statistic—and I’d see it in the 
kids  of  offenders  that  would  come  through  the  system,  that  kids 
that  grow  up  in  a  home  where  there  is  violence—I’m  not,  here, 
talking  about  TV  violence,  I’m  talking  about  watching  their  own 
parents—are 76 times more likely to become offenders, themselves. 
That’s  a  statistic  that  isn’t  about  TV  violence,  but  I’ve  seen  it  in 
my own life, with the kids that we see. 

So,  anything  that  we  can  do—and  I  think  we  need  to  measure 
the effect of some of these things, which are of good merit—to allow 
parents  to  take  more  control,  see  if  they’re  working,  and  then,  if 
they’re not working, to look at other ways that we can make it easi-
er  and  easier  for  parents,  especially  those  that  are  not  of  means, 
to try to limit what their kids watch. 

So, I want to thank you for being here. We look forward to work-

ing with all of you. 

Thank you very much. 
Senator ROCKEFELLER. Thank you. 
And I also thank you. 
And this hearing is adjourned. 
[Whereupon, at 12 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

A P P E N D I X 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII 
Television  plays  a  formidable  role  in  our  lives.  In  the  average  American  house-
hold,  the  television  is  on  more  than  8  hours  a  day.  American  children  watch  28 
hours  of  television  programming  each  week.  By  the  time  most  children  begin  the 
first grade, they will have spent what amounts to three school years in front of the 
television set. 

Television programming can be a tool for enlightenment, education, and discovery. 
But  television  programming  also  can  impart  more  troubling  lessons.  Too  often,  for 
children, these lessons are violent ones. 

Based on decades of research, authorities such as the Surgeon General, the Amer-
ican Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American 
Academy  of  Pediatrics  have  concluded  that  viewing  television  violence  can  lead  to 
increases  in  aggressive  attitudes,  values,  and  behavior  in  children.  More  troubling, 
still,  is  that  despite  this  conclusion,  children  today  are  exposed  to  more  violence  on 
television  than  ever  before.  In  a  survey  of  primetime  programming,  a  recent  study 
found  that  between  1998  and  2006,  depictions  of  violence  increased  by  45  percent 
in the 8 p.m. ‘‘Family Hour.’’ 

Television  is  a  powerful  medium,  and  those  who  control  its  programming  have 
powerful responsibilities. Given the problem of television violence and the harm that 
can  come  from  children  viewing  this  violence,  I  hope  we  can  encourage  parents,  in-
dustry,  and  government  to  act  together  to  lessen  children’s  exposure  to  television 
violence. 

I  would  like  to  thank  Senator  Rockefeller  for  his  leadership  on  this  issue.  I  look 

forward to the testimony from today’s witnesses. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MARK PRYOR, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARKANSAS 

Senator Rockefeller, thank you for requesting this important hearing. 
Over the past decade there has been literally thousands of studies and reports on 
the impact of media content on children. The vast majority of these studies conclude 
that  children  are  indeed  vulnerable  to  the  message  conveyed  in  TV  shows,  movies, 
and games—and that the impact can be harmful. 

I  agree  with  these  studies.  I  believe  that  television  programming,  music,  and 
video  games  have  a  strong  influence  on  children,  including  a  child’s  perception  of 
safe and reasonable behavior. 

I believe that there is a compelling government interest to understand and protect 

children from manipulative and destructive content. 

And,  I  believe  that  it  is  good  business  for  business  to  develop  content  that  is  ap-

propriate for kids. 

I hope that this hearing will start debate on meaningful initiatives to protect chil-
dren  from  harmful  content.  I  further  hope  that  industry  and  advertisers  will  take 
proactive steps to reforming the current trends in violent and sexual content. 

I look forward to hearing from the witnesses on this pressing issue. 

PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL J. COPPS, COMMISSIONER, 

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) 

Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Vice-Chairman,  Members  of  the  Committee,  while  my  duties 
at the FCC unfortunately prevented me from being in two places at once on the day 
of your hearing, I thank you for the opportunity to provide the Committee with my 
written testimony on a subject that is so important to the future of our country: our 
children and the need to better protect them from the ever-increasing violence they 
see  on  television.  Let  me  also  just  take  a  moment  to  personally  thank  Senator 
Rockefeller  whose  unwillingness  to  accept  business  as  usual  when  it  comes  to  the

media’s constant barrage of violent programming at our children is a lesson in lead-
ership that I greatly admire and from which the country greatly benefits. 

I  know  this  because  as  I  travel  across  the  country  talking  with  people  about  our 
Nation’s media, I consistently hear from parents about what their children are see-
ing  on  television.  I  hear  many  voices  but  one  common  refrain—parents  are  afraid 
of  many  of  the  images  television  sends,  upset  at  the  kinds  of  behavior  certain  pro-
gramming  seems  to  condone,  and  totally  turned  off  by  the  extraordinary  and  esca-
lating violence being broadcast into our living rooms. Television is perhaps the most 
powerful  force  at  work  in  the  world  today.  When  used  for  good,  it  can  enlighten 
minds,  convey  powerful  ideas,  educate,  and  lay  the  foundation  for  human  develop-
ment.  But  when  it  is  used  to  mislead,  misrepresent  and  distort,  it  can—it  does— 
inflict lasting harm. 

Most  of  the  evidence  amassed  over  the  past  half  century  indicates  a  relationship 
between gratuitous violence and harmful effects—personal, psychological and social. 
The  facts  are  extraordinary  and  alarming.  Children  watch  on  average  between  two 
and  4  hours  of  television  every  day;  young  children  are  masters  of  the  remote  con-
trol;  and  they  often  watch  television  unsupervised.  The  research  taken  as  a  whole 
strongly  suggests  that  children’s  constant  exposure  to  violence  on  television  can  be 
desensitizing, damaging and even devastating to them and to society-at-large. While 
research  continues  on  how  precisely  children  are  affected  by  what  they  watch,  it 
strikes me as already well-established that unfortunate and negative outgrowths re-
sult from the spreading virus of broadcast violence. 

It  is  certainly  the  case  that  there  is  an  important  role  for  all  of  us  to  play  when 
it  comes  to  protecting  our  children  from  violent  programming—parents,  industry, 
the FCC, and Congress. Parents are of course the first line of defense, and without 
their  active  involvement  it  is  difficult  to  envision  a  successful  cure  for  the  violence 
virus.  Yet  significant  evidence  indicates  that  no  tools  thus  far  available  have  been 
successful  in  containing  the  epidemic.  This  would  include  the  V-chip,  other  control 
technologies  and  the  existing  television  program  ratings  system.  Industry’s  efforts 
have  obviously  not  solved  the  problem  and  the  preoccupation  of  some  media—espe-
cially  large  national  conglomerates  often  more  interested  in  selling  products  to 
young  people  than  in  removing  violence  from  the  airwaves—does  not  provide  much 
confidence  that  it  will  move  to  solve  the  problem.  Given  the  impact  of  gratuitous 
violence  on  children  and  the  pervasiveness  of  this  kind  of  programming  in  our 
homes,  it  becomes  altogether  appropriate  for  Congress  and  the  Commission  to  ad-
dress the issue. 

As you know, Members of Congress requested the FCC to report on this issue and 
to  develop  some  options  for  you  to  consider.  The  recently-submitted  FCC  violence 
report  was  the  Commission’s  response  to  that  request.  It  surveys  the  problem,  pre-
sents  our  considered  ‘‘take’’  on  the  issue  and  develops  several  options  for  Congress 
to consider should it decide to develop legislation on the matter. It tees up such op-
tions  as  time  channeling,  viewer  initiated  blocking  and  mandatory  ratings,  as  well 
as  a` la  carte  or  bundling  approaches  in  the  cable  and  DBS  context.  Congress  re-
tains, of course, the prerogative to act. The FCC violence report married no one ap-
proach  but  instead  responded  to  the  request  for  analysis  and  options.  In  my  view, 
this is the right approach and one that should be expected of the Commission more 
often. The Commission utilized its expertise and experience to develop a number of 
options  in  addressing  this  issue  in  order  to  assist  Congress  in  making  informed 
choices as part of its own deliberations. 

To  this  end,  the  Commission  unanimously  concluded  that  it  is  appropriate  for 
Congress to entertain taking action against program violence. Congress has the op-
portunity,  should  it  choose  to  do  so,  to  establish  innovative,  meaningful,  and  con-
stitutional ways for safeguarding our children from violent programming when they 
are  most  likely  to  be  in  the  viewing  audience.  I  for  one  proceed  acutely  sensitive 
to the need for a carefully crafted approach. I want to see a solution that solves the 
problem  without  creating  others.  I  recognize  that  it  is  not  an  easy  challenge  to  de-
velop  rules  that  pass  constitutional  muster,  but  given  what  amounts  to  a  public 
health  crisis  at  hand,  I  believe  it  is  a  challenge  that  must  be  met.  Serious  and  fes-
tering problems require solutions, so the question here is not whether we should ad-
dress the issue, but how we should address it. Working together—citizens, industry 
and government—there is simply no reason why we should not be able to find work-
able solutions. 

I hope and trust that the Commission’s report and this hearing are the beginning 
drum beats of a march toward better safeguarding our children from excessively vio-
lent television programming.

ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL ADVERTISERS 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF ADVERTISING AGENCIES 
AMERICAN ADVERTISING FEDERATION 

June 25, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 

Dear Chairman Inouye: 
The  American  Advertising  Federation,  the  American  Association  of  Advertising 
Agencies,  and  the  Association  of  National  Advertisers,  Inc.  are  writing  to  express 
our  deep  concern  about  and  opposition  to  sweeping  proposals  to  extend  the  FCC’s 
authority  to  regulate  broadcast  indecency  to  include  depictions  of  violence.  Among 
other things, we believe that neither the FCC nor Congress have begun even to ad-
dress  the  many  difficult  policy  and  constitutional  issues  that  would  necessarily  at-
tend  such  a  vast  expansion  of  the  Commission’s  authority  over  programming  con-
tent. A thorough review of the evidence and growing body of case law demonstrates 
conclusively that the First Amendment problems of such a radical change in the law 
would be insurmountable. 

On April 25, the Federal Communications Commission issued its long-awaited re-
port  entitled  Violent  Television  Programming  And  Its  Impact  of  Children,  l  FCC 
Rcd. l, FCC 07–50 (rel. April 25, 2007). The FCC stated that, ‘‘[g]iven the findings 
in  this  Report,  we  believe  action  should  be  taken  to  address  violent  programming,’’ 
and  that  Congress  could  craft  rules  to  regulate  ‘‘excessively  violent’’  television  pro-
gramming consistent with judicial precedent. The FCC, however, did not attempt to 
define  what  it  meant  by  ‘‘violent  programming,’’  as  it  promised  to  do.  Instead,  it 
merely  acknowledged  that  ‘‘developing  a  definition  would  be  challenging’’  and  con-
cluded  only  that  ‘‘we  believe  Congress  could  do  so.’’  The  Commission’s  admission 
that  the  task  is  ‘‘challenging’’  is  a  vast  understatement,  and  its  Report  provides  no 
basis  for  believing  that  Congress  could  do  what  the  agency  evidently  could  not. 
However,  all  existing  precedent  demonstrates  that  rules  regulating  images  of  vio-
lence on television would not survive judicial scrutiny. 

We believe the FCC’s superficial analysis failed to provide Congress with the guid-
ance  it  requested  in  2004  and  neglected  even  to  answer  the  questions  set  forth  in 
the Notice of Inquiry. Moreover, the Report, while ostensibly unanimous, did not re-
flect  the  views  of  a  unified  agency.  In  this  regard,  Commissioners  Jonathan 
Adelstein and Robert McDowell both issued skeptical assessments of the bottom line 
conclusions.  As  Commissioner  Adelstein  acknowledged,  ‘‘[t]he  difficult  question  is 
precisely which violent programming, if any, the government can regulate in the in-
terest  of  protecting  children.  That  question—the  most  challenging  Congress  faces— 
is never answered here.’’ He compared the Report to ‘‘a financial consultant who ad-
vises a client that he could win the lottery’’ in that it ‘‘discusses an optimal conclu-
sion  but  does  not  provide  a  complete  analysis  or  a  sound  plan.’’  Commissioner 
McDowell  similarly  discounted  the  Report,  saying  ‘‘I  am  disappointed  that  this  Re-
port does not provide more than a cursory mention of these important legal issues.’’ 
He added that ‘‘today’s parents have at their disposal more choices in parental con-
trols and blocking technologies than ever before. Never have parents been more em-
powered to choose what their children should and should not watch.’’ With this fact 
in  mind,  Commissioner  McDowell  called  it  ‘‘unfortunate’’  that  ‘‘this  Report  does  not 
sufficiently  brief  Congress  on  the  full  range  of  tools  available  or  what  can  be  done 
to mobilize parents in this pursuit.’’ 

It is a particular shortcoming of the Commission’s violence Report that the FCC’s 
ultimate  analysis  fails  to  reflect  the  extensive  record  the  agency  compiled  in  re-
sponse  to  the  Notice  of  Inquiry.  The  agency  sought—and  received—numerous  com-
ments  from  interested  parties,  yet  its  final  Report  did  little  more  than  restate  its 
original  questions  in  the  form  of  conclusions.  A  reader  of  the  FCC’s  Report  would 
not know, for example, that each of the FCC’s original questions prompted the sub-
mission  of  a  great  deal  of  data  and  critical  analysis,  and  almost  none  of  it  was  re-
flected in the final product. 

Because  Congress  is  now  considering  whether  to  embark  on  the  dangerous  and 
unconstitutional  path  of  regulating  images  of  violence,  it  is  imperative  that  it  be 
fully  informed  of  the  daunting  hurdles  it  would  need  to  overcome,  such  as  the  fact 
that  no  attempt  to  regulate  programming  that  depicts  violence  has  ever  survived 
constitutional  scrutiny.  As  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Seventh  Cir-
cuit  has  observed,  ‘‘violence  on  television  . . .  is  protected  speech’’  and  that  ‘‘[a]ny 
other answer leaves the government in control of all the institutions of culture, the

great  censor  and  director  of  which  thoughts  are  good  for  us.’’  American  Booksellers 
Ass’n,  Inc.  v.  Hudnut,  771  F.2d  323,  330  (7th  Cir.  1985),  aff’d  mem.,  475  U.S.  1001 
(1986). Moreover, in striking down restrictions on renting to minors videotapes that 
depict violence, the Eighth Circuit confirmed that violent video programming is enti-
tled to ‘‘the highest degree of First Amendment protection.’’ Video Software Dealer’s 
Ass’n v. Webster, 968 F.2d 684, 689 (1992). 

Since  the  FCC  Report  avoided  discussing  these  critical  issues,  we  are  forwarding 
along with this letter a copy of the comments submitted to the FCC on our behalf.1 
The comments were written by well-known First Amendment attorney Robert Corn- 
Revere of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and include an analysis of the relevant social 
science data by the noted expert Jonathan Freedman, Professor of Psychology at the 
University of Toronto. 

The comments make a number of points, including the following: 
• Any  attempt  by  the  Commission  to  regulate  such  programming  would  face  in-
surmountable  First  Amendment  hurdles.  As  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  has 
noted,  ‘‘every  court  that  has  considered  the  issue  has  invalidated  attempts  to 
regulate  materials  solely  based  on  violent  content,  regardless  of  whether  that 
material  is  called  violence,  excess  violence,  or  included  within  the  definition  of 
obscenity.’’ (See pp. 28–65 of the attached comments) 
• Regulation of televised violence would impose either wholesale censorship or an 
incomprehensible  standard.  As  one  study  reported,  if  all  violence  were  elimi-
nated, viewers would be unable to watch historical dramas like Roots, theatrical 
films  like  Schindler’s  List,  or  a  documentary  on  World  War  II.  If,  on  the  other 
hand,  Congress  or  the  Commission  attempted  to  distinguish  ‘‘good’’  depictions 
of  violence  from 
‘‘bad’’  depictions,  the  resulting  vague  standard  would 
impermissibly  chill  speech  and  would  give  the  government  too  much  discretion 
to curb disfavored expression. (See pp. 41–55) 
• A failure to adequately define ‘‘violence’’ is fatal to any attempt to impose regu-
lations  in  this  area.  What  exactly  is  meant  by  the  term  ‘‘violent  programming’’ 
bears  on  every  aspect  of  the  inquiry,  from  the  amount  of  such  programming 
that  exists,  to  questions  of  its  purported  impact,  and  to  whether  the  Congress 
or  the  FCC  could  adopt  any  regulations  that  are  consistent  with  the  First 
Amendment. (See pp. 1–4) 
• Reports  of  studies  and  media  effects  from  ‘‘violent  programming’’  have  been 
vastly  misrepresented  and  exaggerated.  Professor  Freedman  published  an  ex-
haustive review of all of the research on this topic and concluded that ‘‘evidence 
does  not  support  the  hypothesis  that  exposure  to  film  or  television  violence 
causes  children  or  adults  to  be  aggressive.’’  Nor  do  claims  of  ‘‘desensitization’’ 
have  any  demonstrated  connection  to  real  world  violence.  (See  pp.  5–20  &  ap-
pendix) 
• Actual experience with real-world aggression and violent crime provides an im-
portant reality check against claims that pictures of violence produce aggressive 
acts  in  real  life.  By  almost  any  measure,  we  are  living  in  a  less  violent  society 
than in years past. Violent crime rates declined about 55 percent between 1994 
and  2003,  and  a  September  2004  Justice  Department  report  found  that  the 
crime  rate  is  at  its  lowest  level  since  it  began  conducting  the  survey  in  1973.2 
(See pp. 21–24) 
• Regulation  is  unnecessary  where  technology  provides  individuals  with  the  ca-
pacity to select which programs they wish to receive or exclude. As the Commis-
sion  itself  has  observed,  the  modern  media  marketplace  has  greatly  evolved, 
and  ‘‘new  modes  of  media  have  transformed  the  landscape,  providing  more 
choice,  greater  flexibility,  and  more  control  than  at  any  other  time  in  history.’’ 
(See pp. 24–28)

2 Since  these  comments  were  submitted  to  the  FCC  there  have  been  minor  variations  in  the 
crime statistics, but they were insufficient to alter the trend toward reduced violence. For exam-
ple, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report indicated a 1.3 percent increase in violent crime in 2005– 
2006,  but  the  amount  of  forcible  rape  declined  by  1.9  percent  and  aggravated  assault  dropped 
by  0.7  percent.  Overall,  despite  recent  minor  upward  fluxuations  in  some  categories,  the  FBI 
reported  a  3.4  percent  decrease  in  violent  crime  over  the  past  5  years  and  a  17.6  percent  de-
crease  over  the  past  10  years.  FBI,  Crime  in  the  United  States  (www.fbi.gov/ucr/05cius/of-

• In addition to the V-Chip that was implemented pursuant to the Telecommuni-
cations  Act  of  1996,  myriad  market-based  technologies  give  television  viewers 
a  high  degree  of  control  over  programming.  These  marketplace  developments 
empower  individuals  and  parents  to  accept  or  reject  programming  of  their 
choice.  Some  types  of  parental  controls  are  provided  along  with  video  service. 
Satellite customers have access to parental control technology, and analog cable 
subscribers  can  use  their  set-top  boxes,  or  can  lease  or  purchase  a  ‘‘lockbox’’  to 
lock specific channels so that the programming cannot be viewed.3 Digital cable 
subscribers can use their digital cable box to restrict viewing by rating, by pro-
gram title, by time or date, or completely lock out certain channels or programs. 
Such  blocking  options  allow  parents  to  control  programming  in  their  homes 
without infringing others’ rights.4 (See pp. 24–28) 

Without  fully  addressing  these  critical  issues,  the  Commission’s  Report  blithely 
assumes that the broadcast indecency standard simply could be expanded to include 
programming  that  depicts  violence.  While  the  Commission  was  unable  even  to  pro-
pose  what  a  definition  of  violent  depictions  might  include,  it  suggested  that  Con-
gress  could  define  which  violent  imagery  should  be  considered  ‘‘patently  offensive 
to contemporary community standards’’ when viewed ‘‘in context.’’ However, the Re-
port  did  little  more  than  present  its  bare  conclusion  that  Congress  could  dramati-
cally expand content regulation. The FCC, however, is wrong. No judicial precedent 
supports the conclusion that programs that depict violence could be regulated as the 
Commission now suggests. 

Even  if  the  Report’s  analysis  is  limited  to  the  broadcast  medium,  its  conclusion 
flies in the face of the June 4, 2007 decision by the United States Court of Appeals 
for  the  Second  Circuit  in  Fox  Television  Stations  v.  FCC,  l  F.3d  l,  2007  WL 
1599032 (2d Cir. June 4, 2007). Although the case was not decided on First Amend-
ment grounds, the court devoted over nine pages to discussing the constitutional im-
plications  of  any  attempt  to  expand  the  definition  of  indecency  beyond  its  original 
narrow  construction.  The  court  explained  that  ‘‘[w]e  can  understand  why  the  Net-
works  argue  that  FCC’s  ‘patently  offensive  as  measured  by  contemporary  commu-
nity  standards’  indecency  test  coupled  with  its  ‘artistic  necessity’  exception  fails  to 
provide the clarity required by the Constitution, creates an undue chilling effect on 
free speech, and requires broadcasters to ‘steer far wider of the unlawful zone.’ ’’ Id. 
At  *15  (quoting  Speiser  v.  Randall,  357  U.S.  513,  526  (1958)).  Citing  the  Supreme 
Court’s  decision  in  Reno  v.  ACLU,  the  Court  said:  ‘‘we  are  hard  pressed  to  imagine 
a  regime  that  is  more  vague  than  one  that  relies  entirely  on  consideration  of  the 
otherwise unspecified ‘context’ of . . . broadcast indecency.’’ Id at *15. The Commis-
sion’s  unsupported  assumption  that  Congress  could  expand  the  scope  of  the  inde-
cency  rule  to  depictions  of  violence  considered  to  be  ‘‘patently  offensive’’  in  context 
is flatly inconsistent with the court’s constitutional analysis. 

Our three associations, representing a broad spectrum of the advertising commu-
nity, strongly believe that the Committee should reject outright the FCC’s invitation

released  by  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  on  June  19,  2007.  KFF,  Parents,  Children  &  Media 
(June 2007 at 7. While 43 percent of parents surveyed are aware that their television sets come 
equipped with V-Chip technology, according to Kaiser, almost half of those parents (46 percent) 
report  having  used  the  V-Chip.  Significantly,  of  those  parents  who  have  used  the  V-Chip,  89 
percent  found  it  to  be  useful  in  blocking  shows  they  don’t  want  their  children  to  watch  (and 
71  percent  described  it  as  ‘‘very  useful’’).  In  addition,  the  Kaiser  report  found  that  44  percent 
of  parents  say  they  have  used  other  parental  controls  on  their  televisions,  such  as  those  pro-
vided  by  their  cable  or  satellite  companies.  It  also  found  that  the  vast  majority  of  parents  who 
have used any of the media ratings find them useful. Importantly, the Kaiser report found that 
most  parents  are  confident  that  they  already  do  enough  to  monitor  their  children’s  media  use.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOANNE CANTOR, PH.D., PROFESSOR EMERITA, UNIVERSITY 
OF WISCONSIN-MADISON; ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR SUCCESSFUL PARENTING 
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for holding this hearing 
on  the  impact  of  media  violence  on  children.  Since  1974,  I  have  been  a  professor 
at the University of Wisconsin, focusing the greater part of my research on the im-
pact of media violence on children’s aggressive behaviors and their emotional health. 
I  have  published  many  articles  in  refereed  journals  on  this  topic  as  well  as  a  par-
enting  book,  ‘‘Mommy,  I’m  Scared’’:  How  TV  and  Movies  Frighten  Children  and 
What We Can Do to Protect Them and a children’s book, Teddy’s TV Troubles. I was 
a  senior  researcher  on  the  National  Television  Violence  Study,  and  I  have  testified 
several times before the U.S. House and Senate and the FCC on these issues. 

I  have  submitted  my  overall  views  on  the  impact  of  media  violence  to  the  FCC 
in  response  to  their  Notice  of  Inquiry  in  the  Matter  of  Violent  Television  Program-
ming and Its Impact on Children, and I attach a copy of those comments, which are 
also relevant to your hearing. Today, in my role as a Scientific Advisor to the Center 
for  Successful  Parenting,  I  am  focusing  specifically  on  brain  research  conducted  by 
researchers at the Indiana University School of Medicine and supported by the Cen-
ter. I alluded briefly to this research in my comments to the FCC. 

The research conducted at the Indiana University School of Medicine has contrib-
uted to the media violence issue in two innovative ways: by including children who 
are already experiencing problems with violence and by focusing on the functioning 
of the brain. First, a study by Kronenberger and associates (2005) looked at the re-
lationship  between  media  violence  exposure  and  violent  behavior  in  groups  of  ado-
lescents whose levels of aggression are outside the normal range—those adolescents 
with Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD). This study demonstrated that adolescents 
with the diagnosis of DBD have significantly higher exposure to both television and 
video  game  violence  than  do  normal  adolescents,  and  this  relationship  is  not  due

81 

to  differences  in  gender,  age,  or  intelligence.  A  further  study  (Kronenberger  et  al., 
2004)  showed  that  media  violence  exposure  is  associated  with  poorer  performance 
on tasks that involve the ability to both respond to stimuli and inhibit incorrect re-
sponses. More importantly, the IU Medical School studies on brain functioning show 
that both highly aggressive youth and youth with heavy exposure to media violence 
have brains that function differently from their less aggressive peers and differently 
from  the  brains  of  those  who  are  less  heavily  exposed  to  media  violence  (Kalnin  et 
al., 2005; Matthews et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2002). 

These  researchers  have  conducted  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) 
of adolescents’ brains while they viewed images from violent video games and while 
they  performed  other  tasks.  fMRI  measures  the  tiny  metabolic  changes  that  occur 
when a part of the brain is active. These changes appear as a brightly colored area 
on the MR image, indicating the part of the brain that is being used to process the 
task.  The  evidence  suggests  that  teens  diagnosed  with  DBD  have  less  activity  in 
their  brain’s  frontal  lobes  while  watching  violent  games  than  do  those  without  the 
diagnosis.  The  frontal  lobe  is  the  area  of  the  brain  responsible  for  decision-making 
and behavior control, as well as attention and a variety of other cognitive functions. 
The researchers also found that among the nonaggressive adolescents (those without 
the  DBD  diagnosis)  there  were  similar  differences  in  brain  activity  as  a  function  of 
the amount of violent media exposure they had had during the preceding year. Non-
violent adolescents who had more exposure to media violence showed lower activity 
in their brain’s frontal lobes both while viewing violent video games and while per-
forming  a  decision-making  exercise.  In  other  words,  like  teens  with  disruptive  be-
havior  disorder,  teens  with  high  media  violence  exposure  had  lower  activity  in  the 
logical part of their brains. Although these studies do not prove a causal connection 
between  media  violence  and  reduced  brain  function—the  most  recent  phase  of  this 
research does suggest a causal connection. 

The  latest  study  (Matthews  et  al.,  2006)  found  that  adolescents  who  play  violent 
video games may exhibit lingering effects on brain function, including increased ac-
tivity in the region of the brain that governs emotional arousal and decreased activ-
ity in the brain’s executive function, which is associated with control, focus and con-
centration. The study suggests that playing a violent video game may have different 
short-term effects on brain function than playing a nonviolent—but exciting—game. 
In  the  research,  44  adolescents  were  randomly  assigned  to  play  either  a  violent 
video game (Medal of Honor: Frontline) or a nonviolent video game (Need for Speed: 
Underground) for 30 minutes. The researchers then used fMRI to study brain func-
tion during a series of tasks measuring inhibition and concentration. One test used 
emotional stimuli and one did not. The two groups did not differ in accuracy or reac-
tion  time  for  the  tasks,  but  analysis  of  the  fMRI  data  showed  differences  in  brain 
activation.  Compared  with  the  group  that  played  the  nonviolent  game,  the  group 
that  played  the  violent  video  game  demonstrated  less  activation  in  the  prefrontal 
portions  of  the  brain,  which  are  involved  in  inhibition,  concentration  and  self-con-
trol,  and  more  activation  in  the  amygdala,  which  is  involved  in  emotional  arousal. 
In  other  words,  during  tasks  requiring  concentration  and  processing  of  emotional 
stimuli, the adolescents who had just played the violent video game showed distinct 
differences in brain activation from the adolescents who had played an equally excit-
ing  and  fun—but  nonviolent—game.  Because  of  random  assignment  to  the  two  dif-
ferent  video  games,  the  two  groups  should  have  been  equivalent  to  begin  with; 
therefore,  the  most  likely  factor  accounting  for  these  differences  would  be  exposure 
to  either  the  violent  or  nonviolent  video  game  during  the  experiment.  This  design 
suggests a causal connection.

The  bottom  line  is  that  in  both  controlled,  short-term  experimental  studies  and 
in longer-term studies of viewing habits, exposure to media violence has been associ-
ated with reduced function in the areas of the brain associated with impulse control 
and  decision-making  and  increased  activity  in  brain  areas  associated  with  emotion. 
These  findings  suggest  that  even  beyond  the  long-established  impact  that  exposure 
to  media  violence  has  on  imitation,  desensitization,  hostility,  and  fear  (see  my  at-
tached  comments),  there  may  be  serious  consequences  of  media  violence  that  affect 
young  people’s  brain  development  and  functioning.  This  makes  the  issue  of  the  on-
going  cultural  experiment  of  immersing  our  children  in  a  world  of  virtual  violence 
even more urgent and critical.

Comments  of  Joanne  Cantor  in  Response  to  FCC  Notice  of  Inquiry  in  the  Matter 

of Violent Television Programming and Its Impact on Children 

UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON 

September 15, 2004 

I thank the FCC for their Inquiry into the matter of ‘‘Violent Television Program-
ming  and  Its  Impact  on  Children.’’  Since  1974,  I  have  been  a  professor  at  the  Uni-
versity  of  Wisconsin,  focusing  the  greater  part  of  my  research  on  the  impact  of 
media violence on children’s aggressive behaviors and their emotional health. I have 
published  many  articles  in  refereed  journals  on  this  topic  as  well  as  a  parenting 
book,  ‘‘’Mommy,  I’m  Scared’:  How  TV  and  Movies  Frighten  Children  and  What  We 
Can  Do  to  Protect  Them’’  (Cantor,  1998)  and  a  children’s  book,  ‘‘Teddy’s  TV  Trou-
bles’’ (Cantor, 2004b). I was a senior researcher on the National Television Violence 
Study, and I have testified several times before the U.S. House and Senate and the 
FCC on these issues. 
(1) Effects of Violent Programming. 

Researchers know a lot about the effects of media violence. Study after study has 
found that children often behave more violently after watching media violence. The 
violence  they  engage  in  ranges  from  trivial  aggressive  play  to  injurious  behavior 
with  serious  medical  consequences.  Children  also  show  higher  levels  of  hostility 
after  viewing  violence,  and  the  effects  of  this  hostility  range  from  being  in  a  nasty 
mood  to  an  increased  tendency  to  interpret  a  neutral  comment  or  action  as  an  at-
tack. In addition, children can be desensitized by media violence, becoming less dis-
tressed  by  real  violence  and  less  likely  to  sympathize  with  victims.  Finally,  media 
violence  makes  children  fearful,  and  these  effects  range  from  a  general  sense  that 
the world is dangerous, to full-blown anxieties, nightmares, sleep disturbances, and 
other  trauma  symptoms.  (See  Cantor,  2002b,  for  a  more  thorough  discussion  of  the 
media violence research findings.) 

The evidence about these effects of media violence has accumulated over decades. 
Meta-analyses,  which  statistically  combine  all  the  findings  in  a  particular  area, 
demonstrate  that  there  is  a  consensus  on  the  negative  effects  of  media  violence. 
They  also  show  that  the  effects  are  strong—stronger  than  the  well-known  relation-
ship between children’s exposure to lead and low I.Q. scores, for example. These ef-
fects cannot be ignored as inconclusive or inconsequential. (See Bushman & Ander-
son, 2001.) 

Even  more  alarming,  recent  research  confirms  that  these  effects  are  long-lasting. 
A  study  from  the  University  of  Michigan  shows  that  TV  viewing  between  the  ages 
of 6 and 10 predicts antisocial behavior as a young adult. In this study, both males 
and  females  who  were  heavy  TV-violence  viewers  as  children  were  significantly 
more  likely  to  engage  in  serious  physical  aggression  and  criminal  behavior  later  in 
life; in addition, the heavy violence viewers were twice as likely as the others to en-
gage  in  spousal  abuse  when  they  became  adults.  This  analysis  controlled  for  other 
potential contributors to antisocial behavior, including socioeconomic status and par-
enting practices (Huesmann et al., 2003; see also Johnson et al., 2002). 

The  effects  of  media  on  fears  and  anxieties  are  also  striking  (Cantor,  2002a).  Re-
search shows that intensely violent images often induce anxieties that linger, inter-
fering  with  both  sleeping  and  waking  activities,  sometimes  for  years.  Children’s

84 

viewing  of  media  and  particularly  media  violence  is  associated  with  symptoms  of 
posttraumatic  stress  and  with  sleep  disorders  (Singer,  et  al.,  1998;  Owens,  et  al., 
1999). Long-term fear effects are also common consequences of exposure to violence 
in  the  news  (Applied  Research  &  Consulting,  2002;  Cantor  &  Nathanson,  1996; 
Smith  et  al.,  2002).  Many  young  adults  report  that  frightening  movie  images  that 
they  saw  as  children  (often  on  television)  have  remained  on  their  minds  in  spite  of 
their repeated attempts to get rid of them. They also report feeling intense anxieties 
in  nonthreatening  situations  as  a  result  of  having  been  scared  by  a  movie  or  tele-
vision program—even though they now know that there is nothing to fear (Harrison 
&  Cantor,  1999;  Cantor,  2004a).  Findings  are  beginning  to  emerge  from  research 
teams  mapping  the  areas  of  the  brain  that  are  influenced  by  violent  images,  and 
these studies suggest that the viewing of media violence is associated with changes 
in  brain  circuitry  suggesting  a  predisposition  to  reduced  impulse  control  and  the 
long-term storage of violent images (See Center for Successful Parenting, 2003; Mat-
thews, 2002; Murray, 2001a, 2001b; Wang et al., 2002). 

There  is  a  broad  consensus  of  scientific  researchers  that  media  violence  exerts 
unhealthy  effects  on  young  viewers.  One  dissenting  view  of  the  issue  comes  from 
Jonathan  Freedman  (2002)  whose  book,  ‘‘Media  Violence  and  Its  Effect  on  Aggres-
sion,’’  comes  to  the  conclusion  that  the  media  violence  research  is  flawed.  Professor 
Freedman  acknowledges  that  his  review  of  research  was  funded  by  the  Motion  Pic-
ture Association of America. (See Cantor, 2002c, for a review of this book, which ap-
peared in the Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly). 
(2) What Kinds of Programs are of Greatest Concern? 

To  answer  this  question,  one  needs  to  specify  which  effects  are  at  issue.  Certain 
types  of  violent  depictions  increase  the  risk  that  a  viewer  will  behave  aggressively, 
while  other  types  increase  the  risk  of  anxiety  and  sleep  disturbances.  For  example, 
aggressive  acts  with  attractive  perpetrators  who  are  rewarded  for  behaving  aggres-
sively, and for which the consequences to the victim are minimized are likely to pro-
mote imitation. This type of depiction is common in cartoons and slapstick fare and 
in  many  crime  dramas.  In  contrast,  graphic  violence  against  an  attractive  target  is 
more likely to promote fear. Many movies (which are frequently shown on television) 
contain  this  type  of  violence.  Comic  violence  is  likely  to  promote  imitation  and  de-
sensitization,  but  unlikely  to  provoke  fear.  Although  violence  that  is  perceived  as 
realistic  is  generally  more  likely  than  fantasy  violence  to  produce  harmful  effects, 
children up to the age of eight are unclear on the fantasy-reality distinction. There-
fore, fantasy violence can be as harmful to young children as realistic violence. (Cen-
ter for Communication and Social Policy, 1998). 

To  give  a  concrete  example  of  the  difficulty  of  singling  out  depictions  as  more  or 
less  harmful,  ‘‘Schindler’s  List’’  has  appropriately  been  lauded  as  a  film  with  an 
anti-violence  theme,  and  one  that  is  unlikely  to  promote  aggression.  However,  this 
movie  is  likely  to  traumatize  young  viewers,  who  are  not  ready  to  assimilate  such 
disturbing images and events. To help maintain their children’s mental health, par-
ents  need  as  much  warning  about  the  presence  of  potentially  traumatizing  images 
as they do about aggression-promoting depictions. As another example, many people 
grew  up  enjoying  classic  cartoons  like  ‘‘Woody  Woodpecker’’  and  ‘‘The  Roadrunner.’’ 
Although  these  cartoons  may  appear  harmless  on  the  surface  and  are  rarely  the 
cause  of  nightmares,  research  shows  that  they  often  prompt  imitation  and  promote 
attitudes favoring violence in young children (Center for Communication and Social 
Policy, 1998). 

Because  of  the  varied  types  of  effects  that  different  types  of  violent  depictions 
have,  it  would  seem  difficult  to  define  the  types  of  violence  that  are  of  particular 
concern  and  thereby  more  subject  to  regulation  than  others.  A  more  reasonable  ap-
proach  than  trying  to  define  the  types  of  violence  that  might  be  restricted  would 
be to provide valid and easily accessible information to parents and other consumers 
so  that  they  might  make  informed  choices,  and  so  that  they  might  enforce  their 
choices either by rules within the home or by using filtering or blocking devices that 
would be both easy to program and effective. 
(3) TV Parental Guidelines and the V-Chip. 

In  theory,  media  ratings  and  blocking  devices  are  the  best  ways  to  ensure  that 
parents  have  the  opportunity  to  exert  control  over  their  children’s  access  to  poten-
tially harmful programs without violating the freedom of speech rights of other peo-
ple. However, research shows that we have a long way to go before parents can use 
these  tools  effectively.  Awareness  of  the  TV  rating  system  has  declined  steadily 
since  it  was  introduced  (Woodard,  2000).  Many  parents  still  do  not  understand  the 
meanings  of  the  TV  ratings,  especially  those  that  signify  violence  in  children’s  pro-
grams  (Bushman  &  Cantor,  2003).  Recent  research  shows  not  only  that  many  par-

ents  who  have  V-chip-equipped  sets  do  not  know  that  their  set  contains  the  device, 
but  also  that  the  V-Chip  as  currently  configured  is  extremely  difficult  to  program 
(see Jordan & Woodard, 2003, for the most recent data and Annenberg Public Policy 
Center, 2003, for the transcript of a more in-depth discussion of these issues). 
(4) Possible Regulatory Solutions. 

In  the  absence  of  a  means  of  defining  ‘‘excessively  violent  programming  that  is 
harmful  to  children’’  in  a  consistent  way  that  conforms  to  research  findings  and  is 
not  overly  broad,  it  seems  to  me  that  improvements  in  ratings  and  blocking  tech-
nologies would be far preferable to instituting ‘‘safe harbor’’ legislation. To this end, 
the FCC and Congress should seek solutions with the following goals: 

(a)  Creating  or  facilitating  a  rating  system  (or  rating  systems)  that  accurately 
denotes problematic content in a way that is easily understood by parents. One 
approach would be to mandate such a universal rating system for all media. An-
other  approach  would  be  to  facilitate  the  development  of  multiple  rating  sys-
tems  that  would  allow  parents  to  choose  whichever  system  they  find  most  use-
ful. 
(b)  Modifying  the  V-Chip  hardware  so  that  it  can  accept  potential  changes  in 
the  current  rating  system  and  so  that  it  can  capacitate  a  variety  of  rating  sys-
tems that might be developed by independent groups. 
(c) Permitting blocking devices to block any type of violent content that is harm-
ful  to  children.  In  these  days  of  incessant  terror  warnings  and  other  traumatic 
news  events,  parents  should  have  the  option  of  blocking  news  programming, 
and  especially  breaking-news  bulletins  and  promotional  announcements  for  up-
coming  news  stories.  They  should  also  have  the  option  of  blocking  advertise-
ments for violent movies and other ads that contain violence. This would protect 
children  from  being  ‘‘ambushed’’  by  images  and  materials  that  even  the  most 
vigilant parent would not be able to predict, without interfering with other peo-
ple’s ‘‘right to know.’’ 
(d) Providing funding for the promotion of information that parents need to pro-
tect  their  children  from  the  harms  of  media  violence,  including  information 
about  media  effects  and  information  about  the  meaning  and  use  of  rating  sys-
tems  and  the  use  of  the  V-Chip  and  other  blocking  technologies.  It  would  cer-
tainly  be  fair  for  this  funding  to  come  from  license  fees  or  other  charges  to  the 
television industry rather than from general tax dollars. 

(5) Conclusion. 

Media violence constitutes a severe health threat to our youth, and the FCC, act-
ing in the public interest, should move to provide parents with the information and 
tools they need to shield their children from some of the harms that might otherwise 
occur  in  their  own  homes  by  exposure  to  television.  The  television  industry  which, 
along  with  other  media  industries,  typically  denies  any  links  to  harm  and  opposes 
measures  that  help  parents  protect  their  children  from  its  products  (see  Cantor, 
2002d), should be obliged to cooperate in this effort as part of its public interest re-
sponsibilities. 

These  issues  are  important  and  complex,  and  I  would  be  glad  to  provide  further 
information or answer questions about my comments if the Members of the Commis-
sion are interested.

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION 

June 26, 2007 

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
Chairman, 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Education, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. TED STEVENS, 
Vice Chairman, 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Education, 
Washington, DC. 

RE: SENATE HEARING ON THE IMPACT OF MEDIA VIOLENCE ON CHILDREN 

Dear Senators Inouye and Stevens: 

On  behalf  of  the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  (ACLU),  and  its  hundreds  of 
thousands  of  members,  activists,  and  fifty-three  affiliates  nationwide,  we  urge  you 
to  reject  any  proposals  that  would  allow  the  Federal  Communications  Commission 
to  regulate  violence  on  television.  The  FCC’s  recent  report  suggests  taking  that 
overwhelmingly  parental  right  and  placing  it  impermissibly  in  the  hands  of  politi-
cians. 

The  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  is  committed  to  preserving  and  protecting 
free  speech  and  the  First  Amendment  and  strongly  believes  that  the  government 
should  not  replace  parents  as  decisionmakers  in  America’s  living  rooms.  There  are 
some things the government does well, but deciding what is aired and when on tele-
vision is not one of them. Parents already have many tools to protect their children, 
including blocking programs and channels, changing the channel, or turning off the 
television.  If  we  need  to  provide  parents  with  more  effective  tools  and/or  a  better 
understanding  of  how  to  use  the  tools  that  are  available  to  them,  our  focus  should 
be  on  making  those  educational  opportunities  available—not  encouraging  govern-
ment  to  replace  America’s  parents  as  the  primary  decisionmakers  in  their  own 
homes. Government should not parent the parents. 

The  Federal  Communication  Commission’s  April  2007  Report  on  Violent  Tele-
vision and its Impact on Children erroneously concluded that under Supreme Court 
precedent allowing regulation of indecency in the media, Congress has a legal basis 
to  regulate  violent  television  content.  The  Report  further  recommended  that  Con-
gress take action to address violent programming, including limiting violence to spe-
cific  hours  of  the  day  or  forcing  cable  and  satellite  operators  to  sell  their  channels 
on an a` la carte basis.1 

The ACLU repeatedly has voiced its concern over both the constitutionality of gov-
ernmental regulation of violent programming and the adequacy of the research that 
the FCC uses to justify regulation. Our concern is that imposing standards for tele-
vision  violence  would  be  unconstitutional  and  damage  numerous  important  values 
that  define  America:  the  right  to  a  free  and  open  media,  the  right  to  free  speech 
and the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children. 
Parents Have the Power to Control What Their Kids Watch 

Parents play a central role in the lives of their children. Today, they have unprec-
edented  capability  to  control  what  comes  into  their  homes  and  what  media  their 
children  consume.  Aside  from  the  ability  to  just  turn  off  the  TV,  parents  can  use 
the many forms of technology available to them to block channels and programs. 

The  tools  available  to  parents  are  many  and  varied.  The  most  basic  and  user- 
friendly tool every parent has against unwanted media content is the ability to turn 
the  television  off,  or  to  establish  rules  about  where  and  when  children  may  watch 
TV. Current technology augments parental ability to block unwanted content. Tele-
vision  ratings  provide  a  baseline  for  predicting  objectionable  content  in  upcoming 
shows.  The  V-chip,  a  standard  feature  in  all  televisions  13  inches  and  larger  since 
January  2000,  allows  viewers  to  block  specific  programs  based  on  ratings;  multiple 
websites,  including  the  FCC’s  own  site,  provide  detailed  instructions  and  tutorials 
on  how  to  use  the  V-chip.  Cable  and  Satellite  television  subscribers  can  block  indi-
vidual channels using either analog or digital set-top boxes. 

Recent  technology  in  digital  boxes  permits  blocking  by  rating,  channel,  title,  and 
even, in some systems, program description. Cable subscribers that do not have set- 
top boxes can simply ask their cable companies to block specific channels that they 
do  not  want  in  their  homes.  Additionally,  a  multitude  of  websites  rate  television

shows,  permitting  parents  to  choose  one  that  suits  their  individual  taste  and  use 
those ratings to determine what their children watch. 

The  Supreme  Court  has  vigorously  underscored  the  vital  role  parents  play  in  de-
termining  what  media  content  enters  their  homes.  Importantly,  the  Court  has  em-
phasized  that  parental  action  and  available  technology  do  not  have  to  be  perfect  to 
be  preferable  to  governmental  action,  specifically  stating  that  ‘‘[i]t  is  no  response 
that voluntary blocking requires a consumer to take action, or may not go perfectly 
every time. A court should not assume a plausible, less restrictive alternative would 
be  ineffective;  and  a  court  should  not  presume  parents,  given  full  information,  will 
fail  to  act.’’ 2 The  Courts  have  recognized  that  parents  already  have  all  of  the  tech-
nology  they  need  to  block  unwanted  media  content  from  their  homes,  and  have 
made clear that the responsibility remains on the parents to actually use those con-
trols available to them. 

Such technology enables and facilitates precision in parental efforts to monitor the 
media content that enters their home. Nevertheless, the FCC’s Report declared cur-
rent  technology  ineffective  based  on  limited  consumer  use.  However,  limited  con-
sumer use of these technologies does not render the current technology unworkable 
or  inadequate;  rather,  it  indicates  areas  for  more  consumer  education,  awareness, 
and improvement. 

The  government  may  have  a  role  in  educating  parents  about  media  literacy,  and 
assisting them in finding tools that better help them analyze and evaluate what they 
see. 

Congress could consider passing legislation to better educate parents and children 
and  ensure  that  parents  are  able  to  use  the  tools  and  the  technologies  that  are  al-
ready  available  to  them.  The  solution  is  to  teach  parents  to  use  the  tools  at  their 
disposal  more  often  and  more  effectively,  as  they  see  fit.  If  parents  are  upset  by 
what  they  see  on  television,  they  have  the  power  to  change  the  channel,  turn  off 
the TV, or block the station. Monitoring television habits and determining what con-
tent is and is not appropriate should be made in the home, not by government offi-
cials in Washington, D.C. 
Studies  on  Media  Violence  Causing  Actual  Violence  Are,  at  Best, 

Inconclusive 

The  FCC’s  Report  presents  a  slanted  view  of  the  studies  on  exposure  to  media 
violence to support its erroneous contention that there is a substantial governmental 
interest in regulating violence. Though the Report mentions the FTC’s 2000 Report,3 
the FCC fails to reference the Study’s more important Appendix A, which reviewed 
and analyzed the available research on the impact of violence in the entertainment 
media.  Regarding  causation,  the  FTC  noted  that  ‘‘[m]ost  researchers  and  investiga-
tors  agree  that  exposure  to  media  violence  alone  does  not  cause  a  child  to  commit 
a  violent  act,  and  that  it  is  not  the  sole,  or  even  the  most  important,  factor  in  con-
tributing  to  youth  aggression,  anti-social  attitudes,  and  violence.’’  Rather,  the  FTC 
stated  that  the  research  on  causation  had  identified  ‘‘interacting  risk  factors,  such 
as genetic, psychological, familial, and socioeconomic characteristics.’’ 

Such  a  finding  is  in  line  with  the  brief  submitted  on  behalf  of  33  media  scholars 
in  the  case  of  Interactive  Digital  Software  Association  v.  St.  Louis  in  2002,  which 
the  FCC  never  mentioned.4 Those  scholars  stated  that  ‘‘[i]f  one  conclusion  is  pos-
sible,  it  is  that  the  jury  is  not  still  out.  It’s  never  been  in.  Media  violence  has  been 
subjected  to  a  lynch  mob  mentality,  with  almost  any  evidence  used  to  prove  guilt.’’ 
Actual  violent  crime  statistics  provide  support  for  these  findings  and  statements, 
and  demonstrate  that  the  conclusion  that  media  violence  causes  actual  violence  is 
intuitively  incorrect.  While  media  violence  was  increasing,  the  violent  crime  rate— 
specifically the juvenile crime rate—was decreasing throughout the 1990s, according 
to  FBI  statistics.  If  media  violence  was  a  causative  factor,  one  would  expect  to  see 
a rise in violent crime, rather than a decrease. 

Notably,  courts  examining  allegations  that  violent  video  games  cause  actual  vio-
lence have been unconvinced by the data, holding laws restricting minors’ ability to 
obtain  violent  video  games  unconstitutional.5 State  efforts  to  restrict  youth’s  access

to  violent  video  games  attempted  to  use  a  similar  framework  as  that  recommended 
by the FCC for media violence: equate violence with indecency. The courts, however, 
have insisted that violence and indecency are distinct types of speech. 6 

It  has  become  clear  that  there  is  no  one  single  factor  that  causes  violence;  the 
causes  of  violence  are  many  and  varied  and  the  problem  is  complex.  We  urge  Con-
gress to reject any proposals that would allow the Federal Communications Commis-
sion  to  regulate  violence  on  television.  Any  attempt  to  force  ‘‘violence’’  into  a  ‘‘safe 
harbor’’  would  be  unwise,  unconstitutional  and  would  ignore  the  root  causes  of  vio-
lence. 

There  is  a  long  history  of  using  the  media  as  a  scapegoat  for  society’s  problems. 
At  one  time  or  another,  books,  movies,  opera,  jazz,  blues,  rock  ‘n  roll,  heavy  metal 
and rap music, comic books, and video games have all been accused of causing anti-
social or violent behavior among minors and adults. Crime statistics do not support 
these  claims.  Despite  the  explosive  growth  of  the  media  in  the  1990s,  which  in-
cluded  allegedly  increased  violence  on  television  and  in  video  games,  crime  in  gen-
eral (and youth crime in particular) declined. 

It  would  be  virtually  impossible  for  the  government  to  create  a  definition  of  vio-
lence  that  would  allow  ‘‘acceptable’’  violence  and  would  restrict  ‘‘unacceptable’’  vio-
lence. 

Assumptions about the negative effects of viewing violence ignore the positive so-
cietal  value  of  certain  violent  programs  that  teach  us  important  lessons  about  his-
tory or call attention to problems society must address. ‘‘Roots’’ was a national tele-
vision event of enormous educational value that necessarily showed the brutality of 
the  institution  of  slavery.  The  made-for-television  movie  ‘‘The  Burning  Bed’’  was 
credited  with  bringing  about  reform  of  existing  spousal-abuse  laws  and  included 
what some would call disturbingly violent scenes. ‘‘Saving Private Ryan’’ was a pow-
erful  move  about  the  horrors  of  war,  and  included  many  disturbing  scenes  to  illus-
trate that point. 

Shielding children from all violence ignores reality and ill-prepares them for par-
ticipation in a world that embraces violence. As one court striking down regulations 
of  violent  video  games  wrote,  history,  most  notably  ‘‘the  murderous  fanaticism  dis-
played  by  young  German  soldiers  in  World  War  I’’,  aptly  illustrates  the  danger  of 
allowing the government to control children’s access to information and opinion, de-
priving them of the ‘‘freedom to form their political views on the basis of uncensored 
speech’’  before  they  turn  eighteen  and  are  able  to  vote.7 ‘‘People  are  unlikely  to  be-
come  well-functioning,  independent-minded  adults  and  responsible  citizens  if  they 
are  raised  in  an  intellectual  bubble.  . . .  To  shield  children  right  up  to  the  age  of 
18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic, but 
deforming; it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.’’ 8 
Since  not  all  portrayals  of  violence  are  bad,  the  government  would  have  insur-
mountable difficulty defining what is ‘‘good’’ violence and ‘‘bad’’ violence. Even those 
who  research  this  issue  use  inconsistent  definitions  of  violence.  If  the  researchers 
cannot concur on an objective definition, then will any regulations or ratings provide 
truly objective results that please all parents? 

Similar to concerns about the feasibility of defining violence, one court noted that 
the  FCC’s  indecency  test  was  ‘‘undefined,  indiscernible,  inconsistent,  and  con-
sequently,  unconstitutionally  vague.’’ 9 Specifically,  the  court  used  the  example  of 
‘‘Saving  Private  Ryan’’,  in  which  repeated  use  of  four  letter  words  was  not  consid-
ered  indecent,  profane,  or  gratuitous.  In  comparison,  a  single  use  of  those  same 
words was considered ‘‘shocking and gratuitous’’ when used at the Golden Globes.10 
The inconsistent standard in defining ‘‘indecency’’ created an impermissible ‘‘chilling 
effect  on  free  speech.’’ 11 Likewise,  adequately  defining  ‘‘violence’’  will  present  simi-
lar unconstitutional chilling effects. 

It  would  be  virtually  impossible  for  the  government  to  create  a  definition  of  vio-
lence  that  would  allow  ‘‘acceptable’’  violence  and  would  restrict  ‘‘unacceptable’’  vio-
lence.  Any  such  definition  likewise  would  be  indiscernible  and  inconsistent,  and

impermissibly vague was the basis for the FCC’s conclusion it had the authority to regulate vio-
lence on television. Thus, that conclusion is also suspect.

would  chill  speech  by  requiring  broadcasters  to  ‘‘steer  far  wider  of  the  unlawful 
zone’’ and would thus violate the First Amendment.12 
FCC  Recommendations  for  Regulation  Violate  Constitutionally  Protected 

Expression 

Courts have found that violent speech and violent depictions are protected by the 
First  Amendment.13 The  Supreme  Court  has  determined  in  several  cases  that 
‘‘speech  that  many  citizens  find  shabby,  offensive,  or  even  ugly’’  is  still  protected. 
The  First  Amendment  makes  it  clear  that  the  government  should  have  no  power 
to  restrict  expression  because  of  its  messages,  its  ideas,  its  subject  matter,  or  its 
content.14 Moral  and  aesthetic  judgments  are  for  the  individual  to  make,  not  the 
government, even with a mandate or approval of a majority.15 

The overriding justification for regulation of television violence ‘‘is the concern for 
the  effect  of  the  subject  matter  on  young  viewers.’’ 16 Clearly,  any  such  regulation 
by  the  government  would  be  content-based.  Content-based  speech  restrictions  are 
subject to strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny requires that any content-based speech reg-
ulation  must  be  narrowly  tailored  to  promote  a  compelling  government  interest.  If 
a  less  restrictive  alternative  would  serve  the  Government’s  purpose,  it  must  use 
that alternative.17 

The FCC’s reliance on the 1978 decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation as author-
ity  to  regulate  media  violence  is  outdated.  The  Pacifica  Court  premised  its  holding 
on  reduced  First  Amendment  protection  for  broadcasting,  permitting  restrictions 
based  on  substantial—not  compelling—governmental  interests.  The  Pacifica  Court 
reasoned  that  the  lower  standard  was  proper  because  of  the  medium’s  ‘‘uniquely 
pervasive’’ presence in the lives of all Americans’’ and on its accessibility to children, 
coupled  with  the  government’s  interests  in  the  well-being  of  children  and  in  sup-
porting parental supervision of children.’’ 18 

A  recent  Second  Circuit  Court  decision  rejected  the  FCC’s  continuing  reliance  on 
Pacifica  in  light  of  the  substantial  advancements  in  technology.  The  court  went  so 
far as to state that it would be ‘‘remiss not to observe that it is increasingly difficult 
to  describe  the  broadcast  media  as  uniquely  pervasive  and  uniquely  accessible  to 
children.’’ 19 The  proliferation  of  satellite  channels,  cable  television  channels,  and 
the  Internet  ‘‘ha[ve]  begun  to  erode  the  ‘uniqueness’  of  broadcast  media.’’ 20 At  the 
same  time,  ‘‘blocking  technologies  such  as  the  V-Chip  have  empowered  viewers  to 
make  their  own  choices  about  what  they  do,  and  do  not,  want  to  see  on  tele-
vision.’’ 21 

Similarly,  the  Supreme  Court’s  Playboy  decision  distinguished  Pacifica  on  the 
grounds  that  ‘‘[c]able  systems  have  the  capacity  to  block  unwanted  channels  on  a 
household-by-household  basis.’’  Therefore,  ‘‘the  option  to  block  reduces  the  likeli-
hood, so concerning to the court in Pacifica, that traditional First Amendment scru-
tiny would deprive the Government of all authority to address this sort of problem.’’ 
The FCC’s regulatory powers are bounded by the Constitution, and the Courts have 
recognized that technology has changed the role Government can play. 

The  Supreme  Court  has  specifically  recognized  that  cable  technology  permits  a 
level of control over media content that was not contemplated by the Pacifica Court. 
The  Court  in  Playboy  dealt  with  a  statute  requiring  cable  providers  either  to  com-
pletely scramble sexually explicit or indecent channels or limit the programming on 
such  channels  to  a  10  p.m.  to  6  a.m.  ‘‘safe  harbor’’  time  period  in  order  to  shield 
children.22 The Supreme Court struck down these provisions of the statute because 
less  restrictive  alternatives  allowing  consumers  to  block  those  channels  existed, 
stating that ‘‘targeted blocking is less restrictive than banning, and the Government 
cannot ban speech if targeted blocking is a feasible and effective means of furthering 
its  compelling  interests.23 The  Court  stated  that  ‘‘these  judgments  are  for  the  indi-
vidual  to  make,  not  for  the  Government  to  decree,  even  with  the  mandate  or  ap-
proval  of  a  majority.  Technology  expands  the  capacity  to  choose;  and  it  denies  the

potential of this revolution if we assume the Government is best positioned to make 
these choices for us.’’ 24 

Courts  have  rejected  the  FCC’s  very  arguments  regarding  the  ineffectiveness  of 
current technology as a reason to impose further regulation. In Fox, the FCC argued 
that  the  V-Chip  was  an  ineffective  alternative,  because  ‘‘in  its  view,  few  televisions 
feature a V-Chip, most parents do not know how to use it, programs are often inac-
curately rated, and fleeting expletives could elude V-Chip blocking even if the show 
during  which  they  occurred  was  otherwise  accurately  labeled.’’ 25 The  Court  con-
cluded that ‘‘[i]f the Playboy decision is any guide, technological advances may obvi-
ate the constitutional legitimacy of the FCC’s robust oversight.’’ 26 
Conclusion 

Parents have the tools they need to protect their children. If the government steps 
in and regulates the content of television shows or relegates certain shows to a late- 
night  or  early  morning  hour,  it  steps  over  the  line  and  begins  to  parent  the  par-
ents—replacing parents as the ultimate decisionmakers in their children’s lives. 

The  FCC’s  findings  on  violence  provide  a  disputable  basis  for  a  governmental  in-
terest in regulation. Recent court decisions, ignored by the FCC in its report, clearly 
show  that  in  light  of  the  current  technologies  enabling  parents  to  control  content 
precisely  and  through  a  variety  of  mechanisms,  the  government  will  need  to  dem-
onstrate a compelling basis before it can regulate media content [note that the FCC 
didn’t  ignore  the  Fox  v.  FCC  decision—it  came  out  June  4  (and  its  statements  on 
constitutionality  are  dicta)—LB].  In  addition,  the  means  of  regulation  will  have  to 
be narrowly tailored. It is obvious that the time channeling and a` la carte solutions 
suggested by Congress are neither the most effective ways of protecting children nor 
the most narrowly tailored means of achieving protection constitutionally. 

The  most  effective  and  most  precise  mechanisms  are  those  already  available  to 
all  parents.  The  power  to  control  the  upbringing  of  their  children,  including  what 
they  watch  should  remain  in  the  most  capable,  effective,  and  constitutional  hands 
possible: the parents’.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS 

The  National  Association  of  Broadcasters  (‘‘NAB’’)  submits  for  the  record  this 
statement  concerning  the  constitutionality  of  potential  legislation  restricting  pro-
gramming  with  violent  content  on  broadcast  television.  NAB  is  a  trade  association 
that advocates on behalf of more than 8,300 free, local radio and television stations 
and also broadcast networks before Congress, the Federal Communications Commis-
sion and other Federal agencies, and the Courts. 
Introduction and Summary 

While  NAB  and  its  member  stations  understand  that  some  television  viewers  do 
not  want  to  see  certain  violent  content  and  also  that  some  violent  images  may  not 
be  appropriate  for  young  children,  we  respectfully  urge  Congress  to  resist  calls  to 
adopt legislation barring broadcast of some violent content except during late night 
hours.  As  the  courts  have  concluded  in  numerous  contexts,  governmental  attempts 
to  censor  violent  content  are  fraught  with  constitutional  problems  under  the  First 
Amendment, the bedrock of our democracy. Thus, there are competing principles at 
stake,  and  Congress  must  be  especially  careful  to  avoid  overreaching  in  this  con-
stitutionally  sensitive  area.  Specifically,  Congress  must  recognize  that  this  is  an 
area where parents are much better positioned than the government to decide what 
kinds of television programs are appropriate for their children. 

Currently, a broad and growing range of tools are available to help parents guide 
their  children’s  television-viewing  habits.  The  television  industry  is,  moreover,  now 
conducting  an  extensive  campaign  to  educate  parents  on  how  they  can  use  these 
many  tools  to  control  effectively  their  children’s  television  consumption.  Adopting 
legislation  directly  regulating  violent  material  on  television—especially  at  a  time

when  consumers  have  unprecedented  control  over  the  video  programming  that  en-
ters  their  homes—would  impermissibly  substitute  the  government’s  judgment  for 
that  of  parents,  while  also  interfering  with  the  right  of  adults  to  watch  what  they 
want. 

A  law  dictating  that  certain  violent  content  may  not  be  broadcast  on  television 
except  late  at  night  is  very  likely  to  be  struck  down  by  the  courts.  To  begin  with, 
it  is  virtually  impossible  to  formulate  a  constitutionally  acceptable  definition  of  the 
type  or  types  of  violent  programming  that  should  be  banned  from  television  during 
most  hours.  It  is  not  an  accident  that  no  law  on  the  books  in  any  state  or  at  the 
Federal level restricts violent content. Every attempt to do so—in the context of vid-
eos,  trading  cards,  books,  and  video  games—has  been  struck  down  by  the  courts, 
in part because every definition of targeted violent content runs into problems with 
vagueness and overbreadth. Regulations targeting depictions of violence—which are 
fully protected speech under the First Amendment—would meet the same fate. 

Leaving aside the definitional problem, a law regulating depictions of violence on 
broadcast  television  would  single  out  a  particular  category  of  protected  speech  for 
disfavored  treatment.  That  kind  of  discriminatory  burden  on  speech  is  directly  at 
odds  with  fundamental  First  Amendment  principles,  and  courts  have  consistently 
subjected content-based laws to the strictest form of constitutional scrutiny. The jus-
tifications  for  regulation  that  could  be  offered  here  are  far  too  weak  to  satisfy  such 
scrutiny.  Prior  cases,  principally  involving  attempts  to  regulate  distribution  of  vio-
lent  video  games  to  minors,  illustrate  the  problem:  the  social  scientific  studies  on 
the effects of exposure to violent material are far too thin a reed to justify content- 
based regulation of fully protected speech. 

Some have suggested that the government may nevertheless impose content-based 
restrictions  in  the  context  of  over-the-air  television  broadcasts,  citing  to  the  Su-
preme  Court’s  decision  in  Pacifica.  But  that  decision  has  never  been  expanded  be-
yond  the  narrow  context  of  so-called  ‘‘indecent’’  programming,  and  provides  no  sup-
port  for  the  government  to  take  the  unprecedented  step  of  censoring  images  of  vio-
lence. Indeed, there are serious questions about whether Pacifica is viable anymore, 
even  in  the  context  of  indecency.  There  remains  little,  if  any,  reason  to  treat  the 
content  of  broadcast  television  programs  differently,  in  terms  of  First  Amendment 
protection,  from  the  content  of  other  programming  delivered  alongside  broadcast 
stations  over  cable  and  satellite  systems.  To  the  contrary,  courts  are  likely  to  con-
clude  that  broadcast  television  is  entitled  to  the  same  level  of  strong  First  Amend-
ment protection. And there is no question that proposed restrictions on televised de-
pictions of violence would fail strict First Amendment scrutiny. 

In  short,  we  understand  parents’  desire  to  ensure  that  their  children  are  not  ex-
posed to televised content, including violent images, they believe inappropriate. But 
particularly  in  light  of  the  myriad  technological  and  other  alternatives  for  con-
sumers to control the television programming entering their homes, the Constitution 
forbids Congress from seeking to empower parents by censoring speech. 
Analysis 
I.  Any  Attempt  to  Define  a  Regulated  Category  of  Violent  Depictions  Will  Prove 

Unworkable and Thus Unconstitutional 

In  a  recent  report,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  suggested  ‘‘that  de-
veloping an appropriate definition of excessively violent programming would be pos-
sible.’’ 1 Notably,  the  FCC  itself  did  not  propose  a  definition,  despite  having  consid-
ered  the  issue  for  3  years.  This  is  not  surprising,  because  court  after  court  has  re-
jected  state  and  local  laws  regulating  depictions  of  violence,  in  part  because  of  the 
definitional  problem.  As  these  courts  have  recognized,  attempts  to  define  the  kind 
of  violence  that  the  government  thinks  may  be  harmful  inevitably  result  in 
overbroad  and  vague  laws.  As  applied  to  television,  such  definitions  would  produce 
a chilling effect on valuable expression that legislators did not intend to affect. 

Under  the  well-established  vagueness  doctrine,  statutes  must  be  drafted  with 
‘‘sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohib-
ited.’’ Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983); see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 
408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972). Where protected expression is regulated, the Constitution 
requires  special  precision,  because  of  the  potential  for  chilling  speech.  See  Reno  v. 
ACLU,  521  U.S.  844,  871–72  (1997);  NAACP  v.  Button,  371  U.S.  415,  433  (1963). 
The  First  Amendment  overbreadth  doctrine,  moreover,  prohibits  broadly-worded 
laws  that  restrict  a  substantial  amount  of  protected  speech.  See  Reno,  521  U.S.  at 
874; Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 254–55 (2002).

Proponents of regulating violence on broadcast television will certainly argue that 
it  is  possible  to  define  violent  content  in  a  way  that  passes  constitutional  muster. 
But the clear judicial record shows otherwise. The courts have unanimously rejected 
attempts  to  censor  violent  content  despite  numerous  approaches  to  defining  such 
content. 

Winters  v.  New  York.  Judicial  rejection  of  state  attempts  to  regulate  violent  con-
tent began nearly 60 years ago, when, in Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948), 
the  Supreme  Court  struck  down  as  vague  a  law  restricting  ‘‘true  crime’’  novels.  In 
so ruling, the Court stated that violent speech is ‘‘as much entitled to the protection 
of  free  speech  as  the  best  of  literature.’’  Winters,  333  U.S.  at  510.  The  Court  found 
the New York statute’s terms—which prohibited tales of criminal deeds of bloodshed 
and lust ‘‘ ‘so massed as to become vehicles for inciting violent and depraved crimes 
against the person,’ ’’ id. at 518–19—to be ‘‘too uncertain and indefinite.’’ Id. at 519. 
The Court noted that the statute could be used to punish valuable stories and pho-
tographs,  and  that  it  would  be  impossible  for  people  to  determine  which  types  of 
stories were banned by the law. Id. at 519–20. 

Modified Obscenity Standards. More recently, the courts have rejected laws regu-
lating violence using terms modeled on the doctrine of obscenity. Sexual speech may 
be  regulated  as  ‘‘obscene’’  if  (1)  it  predominantly  appeals  to  the  prurient  interest; 
(2)  it  depicts  sexual  conduct  specifically  defined  by  the  applicable  law  in  a  manner 
that is patently offensive; and (3) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, 
political, or scientific value. Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973). In addition, 
a  similar  ‘‘harmful  to  minors’’  standard  permits  the  government  to  restrict  minors’ 
access  to  certain  sexually  explicit  speech.  See  Ginsberg  v.  New  York,  390  U.S.  629, 
638 (1968). 

The  FCC  Report  suggested  that  images  of  violence  on  broadcast  television  may 
be  regulated  using  at  least  some  of  the  parts  of  the  obscenity  standard.  See  Report 
¶ 44.  But,  that  suggestion  is  at  odds  with  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Winters 
v.  New  York,  which  stated  that  violent  material  is  not  ‘‘indecen[t]  or  obscen[e]  in 
any  sense  . . .  known  to  the  law.’’  333  U.S.  at  519.  And  numerous  recent  attempts 
to  restrict  violent  video  games  and  other  materials  using  a  modified  obscenity  ap-
proach  have  been  rejected  by  the  courts.  See  Interactive  Digital  Software  Ass’n  v. 
St. Louis County, 329 F.3d 954 (8th Cir. 2003) (‘‘IDSA’’) (striking down law that re-
stricted  video  games  deemed  ‘‘harmful  to  minors,’’  defined  according  to  the  three- 
part test for obscenity as to minors); American Amusement Mach. Ass’n v. Kendrick, 
244 F.3d 572, 574–75 (7th Cir. 2001) (‘‘AAMA’’) (rejecting video game law’s attempt 
to ‘‘squeeze the provision on violence into a familiar legal pigeonhole, that of obscen-
ity’’);  Eclipse  Enterprises,  Inc.  v.  Gulotta,  134  F.3d  63,  67  (2d  Cir.  1997)  (rejecting 
attempt to restrict trading cards depicting ‘‘heinous crimes’’ under a harmful to mi-
nors standard, holding that ‘‘the standards that apply to obscenity are different from 
those  that  apply  to  violence’’  because  ‘‘[o]bscenity  is  not  protected  speech.’’);  Video 
Software Dealers Ass’n v. Webster, 968 F.2d 684, 687 (8th Cir. 1992) (striking down 
ban on violent videos that incorporated definition for obscenity, holding that law vio-
lated  First  Amendment  and  was  unconstitutionally  vague);  Entertainment  Software 
Ass’n v. Foti, 451 F. Supp. 2d 823 (M.D. La. 2006) (striking down as unconstitution-
ally  vague  violent  video  game  law  that  incorporated  three-part  harmful  to  minors 
standard);  Entertainment  Software  Ass’n  v.  Granholm,  426  F.  Supp.  2d  646,  652, 
655  (E.D.  Mich.  2006)  (invalidating  violent  video  game  law  as  vague  and  not  gov-
erned by the harmful to minors standard of Ginsberg). 

There is no reason to expect a different result when it comes to televised violence. 
In contrast to the age-old concern with limiting depictions of obscene sexual images, 
‘‘[t]he  notion  of  forbidding  not  violence  itself,  but  pictures  of  violence,  is  a  novelty.’’ 
AAMA,  244  F.3d  at  575–76;  see  also  IDSA,  329  F.3d  at  958;  Webster,  968  F.2d  at 
687;  Gulotta,  134  F.3d  at  67;  Granholm,  426  F.  Supp.  2d  at  652.  Moreover,  as  a 
practical  matter,  the  attempt  to  solve  the  vagueness  problem  by  using  obscenity 
phraseology  does  not  work.  In  Webster,  for  instance,  the  Eighth  Circuit  held  that 
the  terms  used  in  the  harmful-to-minors  standard  had  no  definite  meaning  in  the 
context  of  depictions  of  violence,  such  that  video  dealers  could  only  guess  at  which 
videos  were  subject  to  the  law’s  restrictions;  968  F.2d  at  687;  accord  Foti,  451  F. 
Supp. 2d at 836 (striking down as vague a video game statute employing a harmful- 
to-minors  standard,  because  the  statute  ‘‘fails  to  provide  specific  definitions  of  pro-
hibited conduct: many of its terms, such as ‘morbid interest,’ have no clear meaning; 
and  there  is  no  explanation  of  crucial  terms  such  as  ‘violence’ ’’);  Granholm,  426  F. 
Supp. 2d at 648–49, 655–56. 

Specifying  Particular  Depictions.  Courts  have  also  rejected  attempts  to  create  a 
workable  definition  of  proscribed  ‘‘violent’’  content  by  enumerating  the  specific  de-
pictions  of  violence  that  are  forbidden.  Thus,  in  Granholm,  the  Michigan  district 
court held that a law restricting video games containing ‘‘graphic depictions of phys-

human beings’’ was unconstitutionally vague; 426 F. Supp. 2d at 655; see also Enter-
tainment Software Ass’n v. Blagojevich, 404 F. Supp. 2d 1051, 1077 (N.D. Ill. 2005). 
These decisions cast serious doubt on the Report’s suggestion that a regulation could 
be created that restricted only patently offensive depictions of ‘‘severed or mutilated 
human  bodies  or  body  parts,’’  for  example.  Report  ¶ 42.  To  begin  with,  there  is  no 
empirical support for the proposition that these depictions are especially harmful as 
compared  with  other  violent  images.  Moreover,  the  terms  suggested  by  the  Report 
are  necessarily  vague  and  raise  even  more  questions.  For  instance,  would  such  a 
regulation  apply  to  documentaries  or  news  programs  demonstrating  medical  proce-
dures  or  depicting  amputees?  What  about  cartoons  showing  ‘‘severed’’  body  parts, 
where  the  fictional  character  is  put  back  together  again?  What  about  news  depic-
tions  of  war  or  suicide  bombings?  Would  it  prohibit  the  televising  of  Shakespeare’s 
plays, such as King Lear, which include this type of violence? 

Adding  Adjectives.  Nor  does  the  use  of  certain  adjectives,  such  as  ‘‘extensive  or 
graphic’’  or  ‘‘realistic,’’  Report  ¶ 44,  solve  the  vagueness  problems.  These  terms  can 
only leave broadcasters guessing. Does ‘‘graphic’’ include a nature program’s images 
of a lion killing its prey? What about footage from the Iraq war? And does ‘‘realistic’’ 
violence include professional football, hockey or boxing telecasts? Does it include hu-
morous  footage  of  a  fight  shown  on  America’s  Funniest  Home  Videos? 2 Questions 
like  these  have  prompted  courts  to  strike  down  laws  using  similar  adjectives  to  de-
fine the category of violence being regulated. See Software Dealers Ass’n v. Maleng, 
325 F. Supp. 2d 1180, 1190–91 (W.D. Wash. 2004) (lack of clarity as to when a game 
was  ‘‘realistic’’  or  when  conflict  was  sufficiently  ‘‘aggressive’’);  Granholm,  426  F. 
Supp. 2d at 655 (invalidating a statute restricting video games containing ‘‘extreme 
and loathsome violence’’). 

Incorporating  Voluntary  Ratings.  Finally,  attempting  to  incorporate  the  broad-
casters’  own  voluntary  rating  system  as  a  way  to  define  what  kinds  of  programs 
may  be  regulated  would  not  solve  the  constitutional  problems.  The  existing  rating 
system  is  intended  as  a  guide  for  parents  and  viewers—not  as  a  basis  for  govern-
ment regulation. And incorporating a rating system only raises other constitutional 
problems, as it improperly delegates government authority to private organizations. 
Thus,  a  recent  attempt  by  Minnesota  to  ban  minors  from  purchasing  video  games 
rated  ‘‘M’’  or  ‘‘AO’’  by  the  video  game  industry’s  voluntary  rating  board  was  struck 
down  because,  among  other  things,  it  improperly  delegated  authority  to  ‘‘a  private 
body with no duty to answer to the public.’’ Entertainment Software Ass’n v. Hatch, 
443  F.  Supp.  2d  1065,  1070  (D.  Minn.  2006).  And  earlier  attempts  to  incorporate 
the  MPAA’s  movie  rating  system  into  laws  regulating  speech  were  similarly  invali-
dated. E.g., Swope v. Lubbers, 560 F. Supp. 1328, 1334 (W.D. Mich. 1983); Engdahl 
v. City of Kenosha, 317 F. Supp. 1133 (E.D. Wisc. 1970); Motion Picture Ass’n of Am. 
v.  Specter,  315  F.  Supp.  824  (E.D.  Pa.  1970).  Further,  any  requirement  that  broad-
casters submit their programs to a ratings board before they can be screened would 
be  a  classic  example  of  a  ‘‘prior  restraint,’’  which  is  constitutional  in  only  the  most 
limited  circumstances.  See,  e.g.,  Freedman  v.  Maryland,  380  U.S.  51,  57–60  (1965).

In  short,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  FCC  was  not  able  to  come  up  with  even 
a  proposal  of  how  to  define  the  violent  content  to  be  regulated,  as  every  previous 
attempt has been rejected by the courts as hopelessly vague and overbroad. This is 
not  simply  a  matter  of  a  failure  of  imagination.  Rather,  it  illustrates  the  inherent 
problem with having the government try to pick and choose what kind of television 
shows—or movies or video games or novels—people are permitted to watch or read. 
As  Commissioner  Adelstein  observed,  quoting  an  article  by  then-D.C.  Circuit  Chief 
Judge  Harry  Edwards,  ‘‘ ‘any  regulation  of  television  violence  confronts  an  inherent 
tradeoff  between  precision  and  effectiveness,’  and  ‘any  restriction  in  this  area  that 
is neither overbroad nor vague will leave unregulated so much violent programming 
that  it  will  no  longer  accomplish  a  compelling  interest.’ ’’  Report  at  32  (statement 
of  Commissioner  Adelstein,  approving  in  part  and  concurring  in  part)  (quoting 
Harry T. Edwards & Mitchell N. Berman, Regulating Violence on Television, 89 Nw. 
U.L. Rev. 1487, 1502–03, 1555 (1995)).

II.  Even  Apart  From  the  Definitional  Issues,  Restrictions  on  Violent  Television 

Programming Would Not Survive Constitutional Scrutiny 

Even if Congress somehow managed to define restricted violence in a manner that 
was  neither  vague  nor  overbroad  (and  as  just  discussed,  it  cannot),  the  restrictions 
would still be almost certain to fail substantive constitutional scrutiny. 

A.  Restrictions  on  violent  television  programming  would  be  subject  to  exacting 
scrutiny by the courts. 

As  a  threshold  matter,  televised  depictions  of  violence  are  fully  protected  speech. 
The protections of the First Amendment extend to all expressive forms of entertain-
ment. See, e.g., Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 65 (1981); Hurley 
v.  Irish-American  Gay,  Lesbian  &  Bisexual  Group  of  Boston,  515  U.S.  557,  569 
(1995).  Moreover,  violent  speech  is  not  one  of  the  few  enumerated  categories  of 
speech  (such  as  obscenity)  that  receive  no  First  Amendment  protection.  It  could 
hardly be otherwise, given the pervasiveness of violence in classic film (Saving Pri-
vate  Ryan,  Raging  Bull),  theater  (A  Streetcar  Named  Desire;  Oedipus  Rex),  and  lit-
erature  (War  and  Peace;  The  Iliad).  Thus,  the  Supreme  Court  has  stated  that,  as 
a general matter, violent speech is ‘‘as much entitled to the protection of free speech 
as  the  best  of  literature.’’  Winters  v.  New  York,  333  U.S.  507,  510  (1948).  Indeed, 
even  express  advocacy  of  violent  action  can  be  regulated  under  only  the  narrowest 
of circumstances. See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969). 

The Commission is therefore incorrect that ‘‘if properly defined, excessively violent 
programming,  like  indecent  programming,  occupies  a  relatively  low  position  in  the 
hierarchy  of  First  Amendment  values  because  it  is  of  ‘slight  social  value  as  a  step 
to  truth.’ ’’  Report  ¶ 25  (citations  omitted).  That  is  not  the  law.  It  follows  that  any 
regulation  targeting  depictions  of  violence  would  be  content-based,  and  thus  would 
ordinarily  be  subject  to  strict  scrutiny.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Playboy  Entm’t 
Group,  529  U.S.  803,  813  (2000).3 and  laws  rarely,  if  ever,  survive  strict  scrutiny 
under the First Amendment.4 

The  FCC  in  its  report  nevertheless  suggests  that  Congress  could  validly  restrict 
violent television programming, based on FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 
(1978). See Report ¶¶ 22–25. In Pacifica, the Supreme Court arguably applied some-
thing  less  than  strict  scrutiny  when  it  upheld  the  FCC’s  authority  to  sanction  a 
radio station for its daytime broadcast of an ‘‘indecent’’ monologue; 438 U.S. at 745.5 
As  explained  below,  restrictions  on  violent  television  programming  are  unlikely  to 
survive  even  a  lower  level  of  scrutiny  for  a  number  of  reasons.  But  in  any  event, 
Pacifica  has  absolutely  no  application  outside  the  narrow  context  of  ‘‘sexual  or  ex-
cretory  speech.’’  Id.  at  743.  Again  and  again,  the  Court  has  declined  to  extend 
Pacifica  to  new  factual  settings,  stressing  the  narrowness  of  the  case’s  holding.  See 
Bolger  v.  Youngs  Drug  Products  Corp.,  463  U.S.  60,  74  (1983);  Sable,  492  U.S.  at 
128; Reno, 521 U.S. at 875; Playboy, 529 U.S. at 815. 

Indeed, Pacifica itself was careful to emphasize the narrowness of its holding. See 
Pacifica,  438  U.S.  at  743.  The  Court  there  reasoned  that  ‘‘sexual  and  excretory 
speech’’ is ‘‘at the periphery of First Amendment concern,’’ id., and ‘‘offend[s] for the 
same reasons that obscenity offends,’’ id. at 746. Violent speech fits neither of these 
descriptions. Far from lying ‘‘at the periphery of First Amendment concern,’’ speech 
containing violent content is fully protected by the Constitution. 

In  any  event,  there  are  serious  reasons  to  doubt  the  continuing  validity  of 
Pacifica’s rationale even in the context of indecency. Pacifica, decided in 1978, cited 
the  ‘‘uniquely  pervasive  presence’’  of  broadcast  media  and  stressed  that  broadcast 
programming  was  ‘‘uniquely  accessible  to  children.’’  Id.  At  748.  Today,  broadcast 
programming  is  far  from  ‘‘unique’’  in  these  respects.  Of  greatest  relevance,  nearly 

3 The  fact  that  the  goal  is  to  protect  minors  would  not  lower  the  applicable  level  of  scrutiny. 
See,  e.g.,  Erznoznik  v.  City  of  Jacksonville,  422  U.S.  205,  214  (1975);  Sable  Commc’ns.  of  Cali-
fornia, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126–27 (1989) (using strict scrutiny to analyze effort to protect 
children from dial-a-porn messages); Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, 879 (‘‘most stringent review’’ applies 
to Communications Decency Act’s provisions, including proscription of transmission of ‘‘indecent’’ 
communications  to  minors).  Outside  the  extremely  narrow  context  of  sexual  speech  considered 
‘‘harmful to minors,’’ see Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 638, the Supreme Court has never held that the 
interest in protecting children warrants reduced scrutiny. 

4 Indeed,  if  the  government  were  to  define  violent  programming  in  a  way  that  discriminated 
against  a  particular  viewpoint—for  example,  by  restricting  the  showing  only  of  ‘‘glorified’’  vio-
lence—the  regulations  would  be  even  harder  (if  not  impossible)  to  justify.  See  RAV  v.  City  of 
St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391–92 (1992); American Booksellers Ass’n v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323, 328 
(7th Cir. 1985). 

5 We note, however, that the D.C. Circuit has interpreted Pacifica as requiring strict scrutiny, 
ruling in the context of the FCC’s time-channeling of indecent programming. See Action for Chil-
dren’s Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654, 660 (D.C. Cir. 1995).

86  percent  of  television  households  now  receive  television  via  cable,  satellite,  or 
broadband  provider.6 Likewise,  widespread  Internet  access  did  not  take  hold  until 
a  decade  and  a  half  after  the  Court  decided  Pacifica.  The  Supreme  Court  has  ap-
plied  strict  scrutiny  to  attempts  to  restrict  ‘‘indecent’’  speech  on  both  the  Internet 
and cable television. See Reno, 521 U.S. at 868, 879; Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813. Given 
the absence of any meaningful difference in the ‘‘pervasiveness’’ or ‘‘accessibility’’ of 
broadcast television versus these other media, broadcast television must be entitled 
to the same level of First Amendment protection. In view of the protection the Court 
has  afforded  these  media,  which  share  the  very  attributes  that  Pacifica  identified, 
it  would  likely  not  extend  that  case  to  a  new  factual  setting,  such  as  violence.  Cf. 
Fox  Television  Stations,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  No.  06–1760,  2007  WL  1599032,  at  *17–*18 
(2d  Cir.  June  4,  2007)  (describing  how  Playboy  and  ‘‘today’s  realities’’  have  under-
mined Pacifica). 

Finally, even if Pacifica were to remain good law at least to some extent, the level 
of  review  would  remain  stringent.  The  Supreme  Court  has  clarified  that  even 
Pacifica  permits  speech  restrictions  only  if  they  are  ‘‘narrowly  tailored  to  further  a 
substantial  governmental  interest.’’  FCC  v.  League  of  Women  Voters,  468  U.S.  364, 
380–81 (1984). This level of ‘‘intermediate’’ scrutiny is not easy to satisfy. See Turn-
er  Broad.  Sys.,  Inc.  v.  FCC,  512  U.S.  622,  665–66  (1994)  (‘‘Turner  I’’)  (government 
‘‘must demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that 
the  regulation  will  in  fact  alleviate  these  harms  in  a  direct  and  material  way’’).  As 
explained below, legislation restricting depictions of violence on television would fail 
both intermediate and strict scrutiny. 

B. Restrictions on violent programming would fail strict scrutiny. 

Under strict scrutiny, to justify any restriction of violent television programming, 
the  government  would  be  required  to  (1)  articulate  a  compelling  state  interest;  (2) 
prove  that  the  restriction  is  ‘‘necessary’’  to  serve  that  interest  (i.e.,  prove  that  the 
asserted harms are real and would actually be alleviated by the regulation); and (3) 
show that the restriction is narrowly tailored, and is the least restrictive alternative 
available,  to  serve  that  interest.  RAV,  505  U.S.  at  395;  Turner  I,  512  U.S.  at  664– 
65.  For  the  reasons  set  forth  below,  restrictions  on  violent  programming  would  fail 
each prong of the strict scrutiny test. 

There  are  inherent  problems  with  the  rationales  offered  as  a  basis  for  regulation 
of violent content. The FCC Report identified the alleged harm to minors from view-
ing violent content as the basis for restricting violent television programming. In ef-
fect, the Report identifies two different types of harm: an increase in minors’ aggres-
sive  behavior,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  and  an  increase  in  negative  (and  particu-
larly  aggressive)  thoughts  and  feelings.  See  Report  ¶¶ 7–12.  While  the  impulse  to 
protect minors is certainly understandable, neither of these concerns is a legitimate, 
much  less  a  compelling,  basis  for  the  government  to  restrict  protected  expression. 
The first purported government concern—and a key focus of research cited by the 
Commission—is  that  minors  will  become  more  aggressive  as  a  result  of  being  ex-
posed  to  media  violence.  However,  under  controlling  Supreme  Court  precedent,  the 
government may not restrict speech in the name of preventing violence unless it can 
meet the stringent test set by the Court in Brandenburg. It is well settled that the 
government may not restrict speech to prevent violent behavior by recipients except 
where  the  targeted  expression  ‘‘ ‘is  directed  to  inciting  or  producing  imminent  law-
less  action  and  is  likely  to  incite  or  produce  such  action.’ ’’  Ashcroft  v.  Free  Speech 
Coal.,  535  U.S.  234,  253  (2002)  (quoting  Brandenburg,  395  U.S.  at  447)  (emphasis 
added).  Lower  courts  have  applied  this  principle  to  hold  that  manufacturers  of  vid-
eotapes  and  video  games  containing  violent  content  may  not  be  sued  based  on  the 
alleged tendency of those materials to encourage violent activities over a long period 
of time. See James v. Meow Media, Inc., 300 F.3d 683, 699 (6th Cir. 2002); Sanders 
v.  Acclaim  Entm’t,  Inc.,  188  F.  Supp.  2d  1264,  1280–81  (D.  Colo.  2002).  Likewise, 
in  cases  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  laws  restricting  violent  video  games  to 
minors,  courts  have  viewed  this  ‘‘violence-prevention’’  rationale  as  illegitimate.  See 
Blagojevich,  404  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1073;  AAMA,  244  F.3d  at  575;  Granholm,  426  F. 
Supp.  2d  at  652;  Foti,  451  F.  Supp.  2d  at  831;  Maleng,  325  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1186– 
87. 

Given  that  depictions  of  violence  in  the  media  are  plainly  directed  at  either  in-
forming  or  entertaining  viewers,  rather  than  incitement,  and  are  viewed  daily  by 
millions  who  do  not  engage  in  anti-social  behavior,  it  is  inconceivable  that  a  court 
would say they may be regulated as works that are intended to incite imminent law-

6 See  FCC,  Annual  Assessment  of  the  Status  of  Competition  in  the  Market  for  the  Delivery  of 
Video  Programming,  Twelfth  Annual  Report,  21  FCC  Rcd  2503,  2506  (2006)  (Twelfth  Annual 
Competition Report).

lessness  and  likely  to  do  so.  As  a  result,  any  effort  to  justify  a  law  based  on  the 
behavioral  effects  of  violent  content  would  have  to  begin  by  finding  a  way  to  evade 
the governing legal standard. 

The second of the government’s purported interests is that children will be become 
‘‘desensitiz[ed]’’ or experience ‘‘increased fear’’ because of exposure to violent images. 
Report ¶ 7. Although framed as a concern about ‘‘psychological harm’’ to minors, this 
justification  is  essentially  an  argument  that  government  may  restrict  speech  in 
order  to  affect  how  minors  think  or  feel.  However,  the  notion  that  protected  speech 
may  be  restricted  because  of  how  it  affects  the  thoughts  or  personality  of  listeners 
is  utterly  foreign  to  the  First  Amendment.  As  the  Supreme  Court  held  in  Ashcroft, 
‘‘[t]he  government  ‘cannot  constitutionally  premise  legislation  on  the  desirability  of 
controlling  a  person’s  private  thoughts.’’’  535  U.S.  at  253  (quoting  Stanley  v.  Geor-
gia,  394  U.S.  557,  566  (1969));  see  also  AAMA,  244  F.3d  at  577  (noting  ‘‘danger  of 
allowing  government  to  control  the  access  of  children  to  information  and  opinion,’’ 
as ‘‘[p]eople are unlikely to become well-functioning, independent-minded adults and 
responsible citizens if they are raised in an intellectual bubble’’). For these reasons, 
courts  have  struck  down  attempts  to  restrict  minors’  access  to  violent  video  games, 
finding them to amount to impermissible thought control. See Foti, 451 F. Supp. 2d 
at 831; Blagojevich, 404 F. Supp. 2d at 1074. 

The social science cited by the FCC and those who support regulation is fundamen-
tally  flawed  as  a  justification  for  restricting  speech.  Under  strict  scrutiny,  the  gov-
ernment  has  the  burden  of  showing  ‘‘substantial  evidence’’  of  a  harm  addressed  by 
a  speech  restriction,  that  the  harm  must  be  ‘‘real,  not  merely  conjectural’’  and  the 
regulation  must  ‘‘in  fact  alleviate  these  harms  in  a  direct  and  material  way.’’  See 
Playboy,  529  U.S.  at  818,  822;  RAV,  505  U.S.  at  382;  Turner  I,  512  U.S.  at  664. 
The evidence purporting to show that minors are harmed by exposure to depictions 
of violence is flawed and cannot meet the ‘‘substantial evidence’’ standard. 

There  are  a  number  of  weaknesses  in  the  media  violence  research  on  which  the 
FCC  Report  relies.  First,  there  is  little  or  no  evidence  of  a  causal  relationship  be-
tween  exposure  to  media  violence  and  real-world  aggressive  behavior.  Some  cross- 
sectional  surveys  show  a  correlation  between  the  two,  but  ‘‘it  is  impossible  to  know 
which way the causal relationship runs: it may be that aggressive children may also 
be attracted to violent [media].’’ Blagojevich, 404 F. Supp. 2d at 1074. Second, much 
of  the  experimental  research  focuses  on  proxies  for  aggression,  such  as  ‘‘aggressive 
play’’ or noise blasts, rather than evidence of actual real-world aggression. However, 
there  is  no  established  relation  between  those  proxies  and  a  propensity  for  actual 
violence.  Third,  assuming  the  studies  are  accurate,  the  effect  sizes  they  find  are 
quite  small,  and  other  risk  factors  are  much  more  important  causes  of  youth  vio-
lence.  Fourth,  even  if  the  studies  show  some  short-term  effect  on  youth  aggression, 
they do not show anything about long-term violence. And, of course, there are addi-
tional  criticisms  of  various  types  of  studies.  See,  e.g.,  Jonathan  L.  Freedman,  Tele-
vision  Violence  and  Aggression:  Setting  the  Record  Straight  (2007);  Jonathan  L. 
Freedman, Media Violence and Its Effect on Aggression: Assessing the Scientific Evi-
dence (2002). 

Indeed,  the  flaws  with  the  media  violence  research  are  apparent  in  the  FCC  Re-
port. Although the FCC Report reaches the conclusion that ‘‘there is strong evidence 
that exposure to violence in the media can increase aggressive behavior in children, 
at  least  in  the  short  term,’’  the  Report’s  discussion  of  the  findings  of  existing  re-
search  points  to  evidence  that  is  far  more  equivocal.  Report  ¶ 5.  Indeed,  the  FCC 
Report  quotes  a  2000  Federal  Trade  Commission  report  reviewing  the  relevant  re-
search  and  stating  that,  while  there  appeared  to  be  correlation  between  exposure 
to media violence and acceptance of violent behavior, ‘‘[r]egarding causation . . . the 
studies appear to be less conclusive,’’ and that ‘‘[m]ost researchers and investigators 
agree that exposure to media violence alone does not cause a child to commit a vio-
lent  act,  and  that  it  is  not  the  sole,  or  even  necessarily  the  most  important,  factor 
contributing to youth aggression, antisocial attitudes, and violence.’’ Report ¶ 10. 

The  Report  also  relies  heavily  for  its  conclusions  about  media  violence  on  a  2001 
report  issued  by  the  Surgeon  General  entitled  Youth  Violence:  A  Report  of  the  Sur-
geon  General,  but  the  FCC  Report  substantially  overstates  the  Surgeon  General’s 
conclusions.  The  Surgeon  General’s  report  does  not  focus  predominantly  on  media 
violence  nor  consider  it  to  be  a  predominant  cause  of  youth  violence.  And  although 
the  report  finds  that  exposure  to  media  violence  is  correlated  with  and  may  cause 
short-term  aggression,  it  is  circumspect  about  finding  that  media  violence  actually 
causes real-world violence. In particular: 

• The  report  describes  media  violence  as  having  a  ‘‘relatively  small  effect  size[]’’ 

on actual youth violence. Chapter 4.

98 

• The  report  finds  that  ‘‘the  preponderance  of  evidence  indicates  that  violent  be-
havior  seldom  results  from  a  single  cause;  rather,  multiple  factors  converging 
over  time  contribute  to  such  behavior.  Accordingly,  the  influence  of  the  mass 
media, however strong or weak, is best viewed as one of the many potential fac-
tors that help to shape behavior, including violent behavior.’’ Appendix 4–B (em-
phasis added). 
• The  report  identifies  the  unresolved  problem  of  determining  what  kinds  of  vio-
lent  media  content  are  actually  harmful  to  minors:  ‘‘Despite  considerable  ad-
vances in research, it is not yet possible to describe accurately how much expo-
sure,  of  what  types,  for  how  long,  at  what  ages,  for  what  types  of  children,  or 
in  what  types  of  settings  will  predict  violent  behavior  in  adolescents  and 
adults.’’ Appendix 4–B. 
• Ultimately,  the  report  concludes  that  there  is  a  small  effect  of  media  violence 
on  short-term  aggression,  but  not  necessarily  on  long-term  propensity  to  vio-
lence. Appendix 4–B. 

Additionally,  evidence  similar  to  that  cited  by  the  Report  has  been  uniformly  re-
jected  by  courts  in  the  context  of  challenges  to  laws  restricting  violent  video  games 
to minors. For example, the Report heavily relies on studies by Dr. Craig Anderson. 
See  Report  ¶ 8.  But  courts  have  criticized  Dr.  Anderson’s  and  similar  work  in  the 
context of violent video games as failing to constitute ‘‘substantial evidence’’ of harm 
to minors. See AAMA, 244 F.3d at 578–79; IDSA, 329 F.3d at 959; Blagojevich, 404 
F.  Supp.  2d  at  1059–63;  Granholm,  426  F.  Supp.  2d  at  652–54;  Maleng,  325  F. 
Supp.  2d  at  1188;  Foti,  451  F.  Supp.  2d  at  832;  Hatch,  443  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1069– 
70.  In  particular,  Dr.  Anderson’s  research  was  carefully  examined  and  rejected  in 
a  case  challenging  an  Illinois  video  games  restriction.  In  that  case,  Dr.  Anderson 
testified  at  trial  and  admitted  that  the  supposed  ‘‘effects’’  of  exposure  to  ‘‘violent’’ 
video  games,  if  any,  are  purely  correlational,  not  causal,  and  are  quite  small.  See 
Blagojevich,  404  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1060–61,  1063.  The  same  shortcomings  identified 
in  Dr.  Anderson’s  video  game  research  are  also  present  in  his  general  analyses  on 
media violence, on which the FCC relies rather heavily. 

An  additional  body  of  research  cited  in  the  FCC  Report—magnetic  resonance  im-
aging (‘‘MRI’’) brain-mapping studies, primarily the research done by researchers at 
the  University  of  Indiana—has  likewise  been  debunked  during  litigation.  Federal 
district  courts  in  both  Illinois  and  Michigan  have  rejected  the  governments’  argu-
ments that these studies demonstrate ‘‘substantial evidence’’ of harm to minors. See 
Blagojevich,  404  F.  Supp.  2d  at  1074;  Granholm,  426  F.  Supp.  2d  at  653.  Indeed, 
in the Illinois litigation, one of the Indiana researchers, Dr. Kronenberger, conceded 
that his research does not show that playing ‘‘violent’’ video games causes the brain 
patterns observed by his research team. Blagojevich, 404 F. Supp. 2d at 1065, 1074. 
Further, the district court found Dr. Kronenberger’s testimony to be ‘‘unpersuasive,’’ 
id. at 1067, providing ‘‘barely any evidence at all, let alone substantial evidence’’ of 
the harm claimed by the state. Id. at 1074. 

Restrictions  on  violent  programming  would  not  be  narrowly  tailored  to  materially 
advance  the  government’s  interest.  See  RAV,  505  U.S.  at  395.  There  are  two  inde-
pendent reasons for this. 

First,  broadcast  television  represents  a  relatively  small  portion  of  the  media  to 
which children are exposed on a day-to-day basis. Among other media, children are 
exposed to violent content on cable television, satellite television, in motion pictures, 
in  video  games,  in  books  and  magazines,  and  via  the  Internet.  Indeed,  given  that 
86  percent  of  television  households  receive  television  from  cable,  satellite,  or 
broadband  providers,7 most  children  may  be  exposed  to  violent  images  simply  by 
changing  the  channel.  See  Denver  Area  Educ.  Telecomms.  Consortium,  Inc.  v.  FCC, 
518 U.S. 727, 744–45 (1996) (plurality opinion of Breyer, J.) (noting that cable tele-
vision  is  both  pervasive  and  accessible  to  children).  Regulating  broadcasting  while 
leaving other media unaffected suggests not only that broadcasting is being unfairly 
singled out for adverse treatment from all other media containing violence to which 
children  are  exposed,  but  that  the  regulation  will  not  actually  serve  its  purpose  by 
leaving other media unaffected. See Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524, 540 (1989). 
Second,  it  is  practically  impossible  for  the  government  to  connect  the  definition 
of the restricted ‘‘violent’’ programming to specific research identifying what kind of 
media violence is most likely to cause harm to children. Indeed, even those who be-
lieve  that  media  violence  can  cause  aggressive  behavior  do  not  necessarily  agree 
about which violent images are more or less harmful. See, e.g., Surgeon General Re-
port, Appendix 4–B. For example, some may regard violence in cartoons or in shows

such  as  The  Three  Stooges  as  harmful  because  they  present  violence  humorously 
and  without  obvious  consequences,  while  others  believe  that  cartoons  and  slapstick 
comedy are not generally harmful and would instead only be concerned about ‘‘real-
istic’’ or ‘‘graphic’’ violence. This lack of fit between the definition of restricted ‘‘vio-
lent’’  material  and  any  particular  evidence  of  harm  demonstrates  that  the  law  can-
not be narrowly tailored to address the particular ‘‘compelling interest’’ identified by 
the  government,  and  even  an  underinclusive  regulation  would  be  suspect  because 
it may leave unregulated so much violent programming that it will no longer accom-
plish a compelling interest. 

Restrictions  on  violent  programming  would  fail  strict  scrutiny  by  broadly  restrict-
ing  speech  to  adults  as  well  as  minors.  Even  a  rule  restricting  the  times  in  which 
viewers  can  see  violent  depictions  in  television  programming  would  result  in  the 
broad  suppression  of  constitutionally  protected  speech.  The  Supreme  Court  has  ex-
plained  that  the  interest  in  protecting  children  from  potentially  harmful  materials 
‘‘does  not  justify  an  unnecessarily  broad  suppression  of  speech  addressed  to 
adults. . . .  [T]he  Government  may  not  ‘reduc[e]  the  adult  population  . . .  to  . . . 
only what is fit for children.’ ’’ Reno, 521 U.S. at 875. 

This  is  a  real  concern  because  68  percent  of  the  country’s  110  million  television- 
viewing  households  do  not  include  children  under  the  age  of  18  at  all.8 Thus,  for 
the  majority  of  households  in  the  country,  restrictions  on  violent  content  would  do 
nothing to further the regulation’s goals and would only suppress protected speech. 
Moreover,  adults  over  the  age  of  55  spend  more  time  watching  television  than  any 
other age group, and both children ages 2–11 and teens ages 12–17 spend less time 
watching  television  than  any  other  age/gender  group,  except  men  ages  18–24.9 The 
impact of speech-restrictive regulations will be disproportionately felt by adults, not 
children. And make no mistake, regulating violent content could easily affect an ex-
tremely  broad  range  of  the  most  popular  mainstream  television  programming  en-
joyed  by  millions  of  adults.  For  example,  advocates  of  restricting  violent  television 
content  have  called  ER  the  ‘‘second-most-violent  series  on  television  in  the  2005– 
2006  season,’’  due  to  its  ‘‘medical  violence,’’  and  have  also  consistently  cited  other 
top-rated  programs,  including  C.S.I.,  Lost,  Law  and  Order,  and  Grey’s  Anatomy,  as 
containing problematic violence.10 

The restrictions on violent speech would fail strict scrutiny because they ignore less 
speech-restrictive  alternatives.  ‘‘If  a  less  restrictive  alternative  would  serve  the  Gov-
ernment’s  purpose,  the  legislature  must  use  that  alternative. . . .  To  do  otherwise 
would  be  to  restrict  speech  without  an  adequate  justification,  a  course  the  First 
Amendment does not permit.’’ Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813. 

Here,  there  is  no  question  that  there  are  existing  technological  tools  that  enable 
parents  to  block  access  to  unwanted  programming.  The  Commission’s  principal  ex-
planation  for  the  ‘‘failure’’  of  V-Chip  and  similar  technology  is  that  parents  are  un-
aware  that  it  is  available  or  that  they  do  not  know  how  to  use  it.  See  Report  ¶¶ 29, 
32.  The  Commission  further  criticizes  the  rating  system  for  perceived  inaccuracies 
in  rating  content.  Id.  ¶ 34.  But  the  Commission  does  not  discuss  evidence  that  the 
proportion  of  parents  who  have  used  the  V-Chip  specifically  has  ‘‘increased  signifi-
cantly’’ in recent years (from 7 percent in 2001 to 15 percent in 2004), and the ‘‘vast 
majority’’ of those parents (89 percent) have said they found it ‘‘useful.’’ Kaiser Fam-
ily Foundation, Parents, Media and Public Policy: A Kaiser Family Foundation Sur-
vey (2004) at 7 (61 percent of parents using the V-Chip found it ‘‘very useful,’’ while 
28  percent  found  it  ‘‘somewhat  useful’’).  By  2006,  the  proportion  of  parents  using 
the  V-Chip  had  risen  to  16  percent,  with  nearly  three  out  of  four  parents  (71  per-
cent)  who  had  tried  the  V-Chip  finding  it  ‘‘very’’  useful,  significantly  up  from  2004, 
and  a  ‘‘higher  proportion  than  for  any  of  the  media  ratings  or  advisory  systems.’’ 
Kaiser Family Foundation, Parents, Children & Media: A Kaiser Family Foundation 
Survey (2007) at 10. 

Further,  in  2004,  50  percent  of  all  parents  reported  using  the  television  ratings 
to  ‘‘help  guide  their  children’s  television  choices,’’  and  the  ‘‘vast  majority’’  (88  per-
cent) of those parents said that they found the ratings ‘‘useful,’’ including 38 percent 
who reported the ratings to be ‘‘very useful’’ and 50 percent ‘‘somewhat useful.’’ 2004 
Kaiser  Report  at  4–5.  By  2006,  53  percent  of  all  parents  reported  using  the  ratings 
system,  and  the  percentage  who  found  them  ‘‘very’’  useful  rose  by  11  percentage 
points  to  49  percent.  2007  Kaiser  Report  at  9.  That  these  tools  are  working  is  re-
flected  in  the  recent  Kaiser  study  finding  that  the  proportion  of  parents  who  say

they  are  ‘‘very’’  concerned  that  their  children  are  exposed  to  inappropriate  violent 
content  dropped  from  62  percent  in  1998  to  46  percent  in  2006,  supporting  the 
Foundation’s conclusion that ‘‘parents say they are getting control of their own chil-
dren’s exposure to sex and violence in the media.’’ 11 

Beyond  the  V-Chip  and  voluntary  ratings  system,  there  are  a  number  of  addi-
tional technological and other tools that empower parents and viewers. As noted by 
Commissioner  Adelstein,  cable  subscribers  have  various  options  available.  Digital 
cable  subscribers  can  use  their  set-top  boxes  to  block  shows  with  certain  ratings, 
titles,  or  by  time  or  date,  and  analog  cable  subscribers  can  use  their  set-top  or 
‘‘lockbox’’  technology  that  blocks  specific  channels  so  that  they  can  no  longer  be 
viewed. Similarly, satellite television subscribers have access to the Locks & Limits 
feature on DIRECTV and Adult Guard on Dish Network. Digital and personal video 
recorders  permit  families  to  pre-record  and  watch  selected  programming  whenever 
they deem appropriate. See Report at 32 (statement of Commissioner Adelstein, ap-
proving in part and concurring in part). Parents can also obtain third-party ratings 
about the content of specific programs from a number of family and religious organi-
zations.12 

These  findings  do  not  suggest  that  the  best  alternative  to  the  V-Chip  and  other 
technologies  is  censorship  of  speech—on  the  contrary,  they  suggest  that  parents 
would  benefit  from  educational  initiatives  regarding  existing  alternatives  and  rat-
ings.  This  was  the  view  of  Commissioner  Adelstein,  who  suggesting  that  existing 
technologies such as the V-Chip provide ‘‘a good basis from which to build,’’ and who 
criticized the Report for failing to consider ‘‘an education campaign, authorized and 
funded  by  Congress,  [to]  seek  to  improve  consumer  awareness  and  understanding 
of  all  existing  parental  controls  technologies  and  resources,  especially  the  V-Chip 
and  content  descriptors.’’  Report  at  34  (statement  of  Commissioner  Adelstein,  ap-
proving  in  part  and  concurring  in  part).  A  recent  Congressional  Research  Service 
report  agrees,  noting  that  available  research  ‘‘indicate[s]  that  increased  knowledge 
of the V-Chip would substantially increase parents’ perceptions of control over their 
children’s television viewing,’’ which could be accomplished though ‘‘parental aware-
ness  programs  through,  for  example,  public  service  announcements  on  television, 
educational  materials  on  the  FCC  website,  and  possibly  public  service  announce-
ments in print media.’’ 13 

In fact, NAB, the broadcast networks, the Motion Picture Association of America, 
the  National  Cable  &  Telecommunications  Association,  the  Consumer  Electronics 
Association,  DIRECTV  and  EchoStar,  and  the  Ad  Council  and  others  are  currently 
collaborating  on  a  campaign  educate  parents  on  how  they  can  better  monitor  and 
supervise their children’s television consumption. Broadcast television and radio sta-
tions  and  cable/satellite  channels  have  run  and  are  continuing  to  run  a  number  of 
public  service  announcements  (PSAs)  about  parental  controls.  These  PSAs  further 
direct  viewers  and  listeners  to  www.TheTVBoss.org,  where  they  can  learn  more 
about the V-Chip and cable and satellite technologies to better control the television 
programming coming into their homes. 

As the Supreme Court stated in Playboy: ‘‘It is no response that voluntary [action] 
requires a consumer to take action, or may be inconvenient, or may not go perfectly 
every time. A court should not assume a plausible, less restrictive alternative would 
be  ineffective;  and  a  court  should  not  presume  parents,  given  full  information,  will 
fail  to  act.’’  Playboy,  529  U.S.  at  824.  The  government  may  not  substitute  its  judg-
ment for that of parents, including by overriding the decisions of those parents who 
choose  not  to  use  the  technology.  See  id.  at  825.  Indeed,  among  parents  aware  of 
the  V-Chip  but  who  have  chosen  not  to  use  it,  50  percent  report  that  an  adult  is 
usually  nearby  to  monitor  their  children’s  television  viewing  and  14  percent  say 
they  ‘‘trust  their  kids  to  make  their  own  decisions.’’  2007  Kaiser  Report  at  10.  And 
overall,  almost  two-thirds  (65  percent)  of  parents  report  that  they  ‘‘closely  monitor’’ 
their  children’s  media  use,  and  another  16  percent  feel  that  they  do  not  need  to 
monitor their children’s media use. 2007 Kaiser Report at 7. Imposing direct content

available  at  http://www.kff.org/entmedia/entmedia061907nr.cfm.  The  vast  majority  of  homes 
can  also  be  presumed  to  have  V-Chip  equipped  television  sets  because  82  percent  of  parents 
have  purchased  new  television  sets  since  January  2000,  when  the  requirement  that  all  tele-
visions over 13 inches be equipped with a V-Chip went into effect. 2007 Kaiser Report at 9. Par-
ents  with  older  television  sets  that  lack  a  V-Chip  can  separately  purchase  V-Chip  technology 
to use with existing sets.

restrictions on television programming would clearly not empower parents (as would 
a  governmental  consumer  awareness  campaign),  but  would  preempt  parents  by 
overriding their judgments with the judgment of the government. 

In fact, the Supreme Court has previously struck down a time channeling-restric-
tion  on  certain  sexually  explicit  programming  because  of  the  existence  of  a  less  re-
strictive  alternative  i.e.,  channel  blocking),  even  though  the  record  before  the  court 
showed  that  ‘‘fewer  than  0.5  percent  of  cable  subscribers  had  requested’’  their  cable 
systems  to  block  the  programming  in  question.  Playboy,  529  U.S.  at  816  (emphasis 
added);  see  also  Reno,  521U.S.  at  879  (legislature  must  consider  even  developing 
technology  as  less  restrictive  alternative).  That  figure  is  obviously  well  below  the 
figures  for  usage  of  the  V-Chip  and  voluntary  program  ratings  system.  Indeed,  the 
Supreme  Court  has  already  specifically  identified  the  V-Chip  as  a  type  of  ‘‘less  re-
strictive’’  alternative  for  blocking  ‘‘sexually  explicit  or  violent  programs’’  that  ren-
ders  content-based  programming  restrictions  invalid.  See  Denver  Area,  518  U.S.  at 
756  (content  segregation  requirements  on  ‘‘patently  offensive’’  programming  on 
leased access cable channels found to violate First Amendment). Further, in passing 
V-Chip legislation, Congress specifically found that ‘‘[p]roviding parents with timely 
information about the nature of upcoming video programming and with the techno-
logical  tools  that  allow  them  easily  to  block  violent,  sexual,  or  other  programming 
that  they  believe  harmful  to  their  children  is  a  nonintrusive  and  narrowly  tailored 
means of achieving’’ the ‘‘compelling governmental interest in empowering parents.’’ 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–104, §§ 551(a)(8) & (9) (1996). 

In short, the widespread availability of a growing number of less restrictive alter-
natives  means  that  speech-restrictive  regulations  will  be  unable  to  survive  strict 
scrutiny.  See  Playboy,  529  U.S.  at  824;  Ashcroft,  542  U.S.  at  666–69;  Blagojevich, 
469  F.3d  at  650–51;  44  Liquormart,  Inc.  v.  Rhode  Island,  517  U.S.  484,  507–08 
(1996). 

C.  Restrictions  on  violent  programming  would  also  fail  intermediate  scrutiny. 
In  the  highly  unlikely  event  that  Pacifica  were  determined  to  remain  good  law 
and  somehow  applicable  to  regulations  of  broadcast  content  outside  the  context  of 
indecency, restrictions on violent broadcast programming would be valid only if they 
are  ‘‘narrowly  tailored  to  further  a  substantial  governmental  interest.’’  League  of 
Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 380. Such restrictions would founder under this standard 
for  some  of  the  same  reasons  that  would  prevent  them  from  surviving  strict  scru-
tiny. 

First,  the  level  of  scrutiny  does  not  change  the  government’s  obligation  to  formu-
late  a  constitutionally  acceptable  definition  of  violent  content.  Pacifica  dealt  only 
with  ‘‘sexual  and  excretory  speech’’—that  case  provides  no  assistance  in  adequately 
defining violent content. The problems of vagueness and overbreadth that plague an 
attempt  to  define  violent  content  for  proscription  would  not  be  ‘‘cured’’  because  in-
termediate scrutiny applied. To the contrary, those problems would apply with equal 
force and would require the invalidation of the legislation for the same reasons out-
lined above. 

Second,  even  under  intermediate  scrutiny,  the  government  must  still  point  to  a 
‘‘substantial’’  interest  furthered  by  the  restriction  on  speech,  and  must  still  ‘‘dem-
onstrate that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regu-
lation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.’’ Turner I, 512 
U.S.  at  665–66.  Further,  the  regulation  must  be  narrowly  tailored,  meaning  that  it 
must ‘‘promote[] a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effec-
tively absent the regulation.’’ Id. At 662 (internal quotation marks omitted). As with 
strict  scrutiny,  the  government  must  make  these  showings  with  substantial  evi-
dence. See id. At 665–66. These burdens cannot be met here. To the extent the gov-
ernment’s proffered interests are illegitimate (as discussed above), they are no more 
‘‘substantial’’ than they are ‘‘compelling.’’ Moreover, as discussed above, the evidence 
of actual harm is seriously flawed and fails to demonstrate that restrictions on cer-
tain broadcasting content will alleviate the purported harm in any direct and mate-
rial  way.  Under  an  intermediate  scrutiny  analysis,  therefore,  the  lack  of  an  empir-
ical  link  between  televised  depictions  of  various  types  of  violence  and  harm  to  chil-
dren would be fatal to the restrictions. 

Third,  under  intermediate  scrutiny,  the  speech  regulation  ‘‘must  not  burden  sub-
stantially  more  speech  than  is  necessary  to  further  the  government’s  legitimate  in-
terests.’’ Turner I, 512 U.S. at 522 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 
781,  799  (1989)).  Here,  there  is  no  question  that  a  restriction  on  certain  kinds  of 
content would do just that, by restricting speech to many more adults than children. 
Further, the available technological and other alternatives make clear that outright 
speech  restrictions  would  burden  more  speech  than  is  necessary  to  further  the  gov-
ernment’s  interest  of  empowering  parents.  Indeed,  in  Denver  Area,  the  Supreme 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

102 

Court  held,  even  assuming  Pacifica  intermediate  scrutiny  were  to  apply,  that  ‘‘seg-
regate  and  block’’  channel  requirements  burdened  more  speech  than  necessary, 
given  the  availability  of  less-speech  restrictive  alternatives  such  as  the  V-Chip  and 
cable  ‘‘lockboxes.’’  Denver  Area,  518  U.S.  at  756,  758–59.  In  light  of  the  numerous 
tools  available  to  parents  to  direct  their  children’s  viewing  habits  on  a  household- 
by-household basis, the same analysis would apply to proposed legislation to restrict 
the airing of programming containing violent images. 

In short, restrictions on violent broadcast programming would be unconstitutional 
under  intermediate  as  well  as  strict  scrutiny.  That  conclusion  is  only  bolstered  by 
the novelty of regulating violent content and the virtual impossibility of formulating 
an appropriate definition of exactly what is restricted. 
Conclusion 

Particularly at a time when consumers have unprecedented control over the video 
programming  that  enters  their  homes,  any  legislation  restricting  broadcast  of  cer-
tain  violent  television  content  would  impermissibly  substitute  the  government’s 
judgment  for  that  of  parents  and  interfere  with  the  right  of  adults  to  watch  what 
they  want.  Any  such  legislation  would  be  fraught  with  constitutional  problems 
under  the  First  Amendment,  and  would  be  very  likely  to  be  struck  down  by  the 
courts.

Hon. DANIEL K. INOUYE, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Inouye: 

As  representatives  of  some  of  the  hundreds  of  program  networks  that  provide  a 
wide variety of diverse programming selections for millions of American consumers, 
we  urge  you  to  oppose  government  regulation  of  the  packaging  and  pricing  of  cable 
and satellite television programming. 

Simple sounding solutions, such as a` la carte regulation, are misguided and would 
not result in the benefits portrayed by its supporters. In fact, such regulation would 
endanger  high  quality  family-friendly  programming  available  today  leaving  parents 
and children with fewer viewing options. Additionally, in an a` la carte environment, 
networks would be forced to spend substantially more money to continuously market 
their  channels,  in  order  to  attract  a  sufficient  number  of  subscribers  to  survive. 
Ironically, this may also result in decreased programming budgets, forcing program-
mers to reduce their investment in original and high quality programming. 

Program networks such as ours were developed in response to the increasingly di-
verse  demands  and  interests  of  consumers.  We  provide  audiences  with  a  wealth  of 
programming  options,  including  among  other  things,  news  and  public  affairs,  reli-
gious, Spanish-language and other ethnic programming, family and educational pro-
gramming,  children’s  programming,  documentaries,  sports,  music,  and  general  en-
tertainment. 

Producing this high quality programming depends on two revenue sources: license 
fees paid by cable and satellite carriers and advertising sales. This economic model 
has been tremendously successful in improving both the quality and quantity of tel-
evision programming available today. Government mandated packaging regulations, 
and  in  particular  a  pay  per  channel  requirement,  would  undermine  this  model, 
cause  the  demise  of  many  existing  networks,  and  hinder  the  creation  of  new  ones. 
We know from experience that the marketplace spurs innovation and that unnec-
essary  government  regulation  stifles  growth  and  innovation.  Nearly  every  inde-
pendent study of this issue has reached the same conclusion—mandatory packaging 
or a` la carte regulation would significantly reduce program diversity, limit consumer 
choice,  and  likely  increase  consumer  prices.  It  would  also  raise  significant  First 
Amendment  questions.  We  therefore  respectfully  urge  you  to  oppose  proposals  for 
such government regulation.

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

JEFF J. MCINTYRE 

Question  1.  This  month  (June  2007)  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  found  that 
only 16 percent of parents have even used the V-Chip. In an earlier report, the Kai-
ser  Family  Foundation  found  that  many  shows  containing  violence  did  not  receive 
a  violent  content  rating.  This  raises  serious  questions  about  whether  the  V-Chip  is 
an  effective  way  for  parents  to  block  shows  containing  violence.  Do  you  think  that 
the  V-Chip  is  an  adequate  tool  for  preventing  children  from  viewing  violent  pro-
gramming? 

Answer. The V-Chip can be an effective tool for informing parents about inappro-
priate  content  and  can  be  adequate  for  allowing  parents  to  prevent  their  children 
from viewing inappropriate material. Unfortunately, there is violent content that is 
not  blocked.  Often,  material  that  is  not  considered  violent  by  an  adult  is  violent 
from a child’s viewpoint (e.g., violent cartoons). 

There  is  also  a  discrepancy  between  the  various  networks  as  to  what  constitutes 
violence  for  all  levels.  Consequently,  programming  rated  as  violent  for  one  network 
may escape rating as violent for different network. 

In order for more parents to use the ratings, they must be made more consistent, 

be more consistently applied, and be better marketed to a broader audience. 

Question 2. Are you comfortable with the level of violence on television today? 
Answer.  Through  the  efforts  of  the  public  health  community  (American  Psycho-
logical  Association,  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics,  etc.)  and  the  child  advocacy 
community  (Children  Now,  Parent’s  Television  Council,  etc.),  parents  are  more 
aware  of  the  consequences  of  media  violence  in  their  children’s  lives.  With  that 
awareness  comes  a  discomfort  with  the  state  of  the  children’s  media  environment 
broadly.  With  a  growing  amount  of  violent  and  sexual  material  in  children’s  media 
and  a  comparatively  insignificant  amount  of  children’s  educational  programming, 
parents need better tools for managing their child’s media diet. 

Question  3.  In  1990,  Congress  passed  the  Television  Program  Improvement  Act. 
It  provided  antitrust  immunity  to  the  television  industry  to  allow  the  networks  to

104 

meet and agree on voluntary programming standards. The networks agreed to note 
before  violent  programming,  that  ‘‘due  to  some  violent  content,  parental  discretion 
is advised.’’ Is this warning sufficient? 

Answer. This warning is not sufficient. In the mid-90s the television industry ne-
gotiated an agreement with the public health, child advocacy, and education commu-
nities regarding a more detailed ratings system that would give parents more infor-
mation  about  the  material  their  children  were  watching  so  they  could  make  a 
healthy  decision  about  their  children’s  media  diet  themselves—instead  of  having  it 
dictated  to  them  by  the  networks.  Broad  language,  such  as  ‘‘some  violent  content’’ 
does not allow parents to be properly informed about the range of violence that chil-
dren may be exposed to. There ‘‘parental discretion advised’’ warnings are rarely ap-
plied to cartoons with violent content—which can have a significant impact on very 
young children. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

JEFF J. MCINTYRE 

Question.  Much  of  the  hearing  focused  on  violent  programming,  and  what  we 
should do about that. I would like to focus on another source of television violence— 
the commercials. 

Often  times,  it  seems  that  the  commercials  contain  just  as  much  violence  as  the 
actual  television  programming  that  they  are  funding.  Furthermore,  with  commer-
cials,  parents  have  very  little  control  over  what  their  children  are  seeing.  Unlike 
programming,  they  don’t  know  the  general  content  of  commercials  in  advance,  and 
the commercials are not rated or subject to blocking by the V-Chip. 

So, I would like to ask the members of the panel—what can we do to help parents 

who want to control the level of violence in commercials? 

Answer. More consistent ratings and a more consistent application of the ratings, 
along with commercial content consistent with the rating for that program, is what 
is  needed  to  better  control  the  levels  of  violence  in  all  programming—commercials 
included. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO 

JEFF J. MCINTYRE 

Question.  I  believe  that  one  of  the  problems  we  will  have  with  the  use  of  the  V- 
Chip  is  that  parents  don’t  realize  the  subtle  impact  that  programming  has  on  chil-
dren,  and,  therefore,  the  hassle  of  using  the  V-Chip  devalues  it  use.  I  also  think 
that  the  current  V-Chip  technology  doesn’t  take  into  account  that  many  families 
have all household members, of all ages using the same equipment. What is suitable 
for a five-year old, doesn’t work for your ten-year old, or doesn’t work for the parent. 
The  V-Chip,  to  me,  would  be  convenient  as  a  one  time  process  or  for  a  periodical 
update but not as a daily or weekly tool for parents to employ. Even with the indus-
try’s  recent  campaign  about  the  availability  of  the  V-Chip,  the  Kaiser  Foundation 
has found only a modest improvement in the use of the parental block. In 2004, the 
KFF found that 15 percent of parents have used the V-Chip. In 2007, the KFF found 
that 16 percent of parents say they have ever used the V-Chip to block objectionable 
programming. 

Although  82  percent  of  parents  now  say  that  they  have  purchased  a  new  tele-
vision  since  January  1,  2000,  more  than  half  (57  percent)  are  not  aware  that  they 
have a V-Chip. For years, there has been talk about adding the so-called ‘‘V’’ button 
to  the  remote  of  the  equipment,  but  I  understand  that  manufacturers  have  ex-
pressed concern about the cost of adding the button and room for the button on the 
remote.  I  brought  four  remotes  with  me  to  the  hearing,  and  they  all  have  lots  of 
buttons but only one—TiVo—offers a parental control button. 

I  would  like  to  hear  from  each  member  of  the  panel  about  the  strengths  and 

weaknesses of the V-Chip and on the merits of the V-button. 

Answer. Foremost, as I am aware, there is no research on a ‘V-Chip button.’ How-
ever, parents will benefit from more options being made more readily available. Cer-
tainly, the ease of access that a v-chip button’ presents could be a path to that. 

The  strength  of  the  V-Chip  is  information.  The  V-Chip  and  the  television  ratings 
system  is  designed  to  put  the  decision  making  into  the  parent’s  hands  regarding 
what  is  most  appropriate  for  their  children’s  media  viewing  habits.  As  each  parent 
knows  their  own  values  and  children’s  needs  best—a  detailed,  easy  to  use  ratings 
system  allows  for  parents  to  choose  the  material  they  allow  in  their  household— 
based on their individual child’s needs. This prevents the industry (through broadly

105 

worded,  ineffective  warnings)  and  the  government  (through  censorship)  from  mak-
ing the decision that the parents are best to make for themselves. 

There  are  several  areas  of  improvement  available  for  the  current  television  rat-
ings system and the V-chip. A few examples of needed areas of improvement follow. 
The  ratings  are  not  applied  consistently.  What  one  network  may  consider  violent 

at TV–14 does not merit a rating by another. 

There  is  variety  in  ratings  definitions.  The  amounts  of  violence,  sexual  material, 

and language vary greatly across all ratings and all networks. 

The rating of ‘FV’ for ‘fantasy violence’ is largely misunderstood. Often applied to 

cartoons, many viewers have thought this meant ‘family viewing.’ 

Education efforts regarding the V-Chip have been sporadic, during ineffective pro-
gramming  slots,  and  done  mostly  in  response  to  political  pressure.  These  ads  have 
also  emphasized  the  age  based  ratings  of  the  ratings  system—while  research  dem-
onstrates  the  content  based  ratings  to  be  the  most  useful  to  parents  and  the  most 
effective in combating violence in the media. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

TIMOTHY F. WINTER 

Question  1.  This  month  (June  2007)  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  found  that 
only 16 percent of parents have even used the V-Chip. In an earlier report, the Kai-
ser  Family  Foundation  found  that  many  shows  containing  violence  did  not  receive 
a  violent  content  rating.  This  raises  serious  questions  about  whether  the  V-Chip  is 
an  effective  way  for  parents  to  block  shows  containing  violence.  Do  you  think  that 
the  V-Chip  is  an  adequate  tool  for  preventing  children  from  viewing  violent  pro-
gramming? 

Answer.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  unfortunate  answer  is  a  resounding  NO,  the  V-Chip 
is  not  an  adequate  tool  for  preventing  children  from  viewing  violent  programming. 
Anyone  who  claims  it  to  be  an  adequate  solution  is  either  fooling  themselves  or  is 
attempting to fool this Committee. 

The fundamental flaw with blocking devices like the V-Chip is that those who are 
tasked  with  its  success  are  financially  motivated  by  its  failure.  Please  remember 
that, in the television industry, the viewer is NOT the true ‘‘customer’’. Rather, the 
advertiser  is  the  true  customer,  and  the  viewer  is  actually  the  product  that  the  TV 
network is selling to the advertiser. As such, the networks base their financial per-
formance  on  audience  size  and  advertiser  rates.  Anything  that  would  or  could  re-
duce  either  audience  size  or  advertiser  rates  will  reduce  the  broadcaster’s  revenue. 
Because the networks assign content ratings to their own programming, there is an 
inherent conflict of interest for the programs to be rated accurately. If the programs 
are not rated accurately, the V-Chip simply cannot function properly. And both par-
ents and advertisers lose. 

When the V-Chip was first discussed in the Congress over a decade ago, the tele-
vision  industry  denounced  it  as  censorship.  They  opposed  such  a  system  until  they 
were  able  to  find  a  way  to  render  it  wholly  ineffective;  and  having  achieved  that, 
now  they  are  pointing  to  it  as  a  reason  why  the  broadcast  indecency  laws  should 
be overturned. I cannot urge this Committee in strong enough terms to see through 
this smoke screen. 

The Parents Television Council has published several in-depth reports of the tele-
vision  content  rating  system.  The  findings  of  those  reports  demonstrate  just  how 
broken  the  system  is:  Ratings  are  inaccurate  or  incomplete  up  to  80  percent  of  the 
time.  For  example,  in  the  video  clips  we  assembled  for  this  hearing  at  the  request 
of Senator Rockefeller, one scene depicted a woman snorting heroin from the sliced- 
open intestines of her dead brother. There was no indicator for violence on this pro-
gram,  which  CBS  aired  at  8  p.m.  during  the  so-called  ‘‘Family  Hour.’’  This  type  of 
content  rating  omission  is  not  an  exception;  it  is  the  norm  on  broadcast  TV  today. 
In  fact  there  was  not  one  single  program  airing  during  primetime  broadcast  tele-
vision  in  the  past  year  was  rated  for  ‘‘mature’’  audiences;  99  percent  were  either 
TV–PG or TV–13. 

In  order  for  a  technology  solution  like  the  V-Chip  to  provide  any  meaningful  as-
sistance  to  parents  and  families,  the  following  six  (6)  points  need  to  be  considered: 
1. The content ratings must be determined independently, not by those who are 
financially motivated by its failure. 
2.  The  content  ratings  must  be  transparent.  In  the  aforementioned  video  clip 
depicting  a  woman  snorting  heroin  from  the  sliced-open  intestines  of  her  dead 
brother,  would  a  ‘‘V’’  descriptor  be  an  adequate  warning  for  a  parent  when  a 
‘‘V’’  descriptor  might  also  connote  a  fistfight?  Are  all  ‘‘V’’  scenes  equal?  Do  cer-

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00109 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

106 

tain  types  of  sexual  scenes  warrant  a  ‘stronger  S’  rating?  The  program  content 
must  be  fully  and  transparently  disclosed  if  the  V-Chip  is  to  be  of  any  real 
value. 
3.  There  must  be  a  consequence  if  ratings  are  intentionally  incorrect  or  mis-
leading.  There  is  no  penalty  today  for  the  consistent  under-rating  of  content. 
And if a member of the public seeks to complain about an inaccurate application 
of a content rating, whom does he or she contact, and how? 
4.  The  ratings  system  must  be  consistent,  not  just  across  one  network  but 
across  the  entire  medium.  Our  research  has  shown  that  the  ratings  are  arbi-
trarily  applied  even  within  the  same  television  network.  And  the  arbitrary  na-
ture  becomes  even  worse  across  other  networks,  as  there  is  no  industry  stand-
ard on which all the networks base their ratings. 
5.  Network  program  promotions  and  TV  commercials  must  be  rated.  Each  and 
every day we hear from parents who attempt to make good TV viewing choices 
for  their  families,  only  to  be  blasted  with  graphic,  gory,  gratuitous  scenes  from 
the  promos  of  other  programs  the  network  is  promoting  or  from  the  content  of 
TV commercials. 
6.  The  ratings  system  should  be  a  universal  system  that  crosses  all  electronic 
media.  Why  should  parents  and  families  be  required  to  learn  one  content  rat-
ings  system  for  motion  pictures,  another  ratings  system  for  television,  yet  an-
other  ratings  system  for  video  games,  and  other  systems  still  for  music  lyrics 
and the internet? There could—and should—be one system for all media. 

There is no question that parents need more and better tools to help them control 
the enormous amounts of graphic content that comes into their homes. The six steps 
outlined  above  would  be  a  drastic  improvement,  but  a  better  technology  solution 
must  not  lead  to  the  elimination  of  existing  broadcast  indecency  laws.  Even  if  not 
legally indecent, parents should have such a resource so they can make better view-
ing decisions. 

Question 2. Are you comfortable with the level of violence on television today? 
Answer. No, Mr. Chairman. I am not comfortable with the level of violence on tel-
evision today. Not only is there more violence on TV today, the depictions of violence 
are  far  more  realistic  and  more  heinous  than  ever  before.  More  often  those  depic-
tions  are  of  sexual  violence.  And  sadly,  there  is  a  growing  trend  to  depict  children 
as the victims of graphic violence. 

In a major study released earlier this year entitled ‘‘Dying to Entertain,’’ the Par-
ents  Television  Council  documented  a  75  percent  increase  in  the  number  of  violent 
instances  per  hour  during  prime  time  between  1998  and  2006,  as  well  as  the  major 
findings  listed  below.  Based  on  overwhelming  amount  of  violent  content  chronicled 
in this report, there is no question that the amount of violence on prime time broad-
cast television has reached a near epidemic level. 

Between 1998 and 2006: 
• Violence increased in every time slot: 

» Violence during the 8 p.m. Family Hour has increased by 45 percent. 
» Violence during the 9 p.m. hour has increased by 92 percent. 
» Violence during the 10 p.m. hour has increased by 167 percent. 

• ABC  experienced  the  biggest  increase  in  violent  content  overall.  In  1998,  ABC 
averaged  .93  instances  of  violence  per  hour  during  prime  time.  By  2006,  ABC 
was  averaging  3.80  instances  of  violence  per  hour—an  increase  of  309  percent. 
• Fox,  the  second-most  violent  network  in  1998,  experienced  the  smallest  in-
crease.  Fox  averaged  3.43  instances  of  violence  per  hour  in  1998  and  3.84  in-
stances of violence per hour by 2006—an increase of only 12 percent. 
• Violent  scenes  increasingly  include  a  sexual  element.  Rapists,  sexual  predators 
and  fetishists  are  cropping  up  with  increasing  frequency  on  prime  time  pro-
grams  like  Law  and  Order:  S.V.U.,  C.S.I.,  C.S.I.  Miami,  C.S.I.  New  York,  Me-
dium, Crossing Jordan, Prison Break, E.R. and House. 

o’clock hours between 1998 and the 2005–2006 television season. 

On an hour by hour basis: 
• Every  network  experienced  an  increase  in  violence  during  the  9  o’clock  and  10 
• ABC  experienced  the  biggest  increase  in  violent  content  during  the  Family 
Hour. In 1998 ABC was the least-violent network, averaging only .13 instances 
of violence per hour. By 2006, ABC was averaging 2.23 instances of violence per 
hour, an increase of 1615.4 percent.

• UPN and Fox were the only networks to feature less violence during the Family 
Hour in 2005–2006 than in 1998. Violence on Fox decreased by 18 percent, and 
on UPN by 83 percent. 
• ABC  experienced  the  biggest  increase  in  violent  content  during  the  9  o’clock 
hour,  jumping  from  .31  instances  per  hour  in  1998  to  5.71  instances  per  hour 
during the 2005–2006 season—an increase of 1,742 percent. 
• NBC  experienced  the  biggest  increase  in  violent  content—635  percent—during 
the  10  o’clock  hour,  from  2  instances  of  violence  per  hour  in  1998  to  nearly  15 
instances of violence per hour in 2005–2006.

During the 2005–2006 Season:

• The WB network had the highest frequency of violence during the Family Hour 
during  the  2005–2006  season  with  an  average  of  3.74  incidents  of  violence  per 
hour. 
• CBS  was  the  most  violent  network  during  the  9  o’clock  hour  during  the  2005– 
• ABC’s  short-lived  series  Night  Stalker  was  the  most  violent  program  on  tele-
vision  in  the  2005–2006  television  season.  In  the  sole,  one-hour  episode  that 
aired during the study period there were 26 instances of violence. 
• Every  episode  of  every  program  airing  on  NBC  in  the  10  o’clock  hour  during 
the 2005–2006 season contained at least one instance of violence. On a per-hour 
basis, NBC’s 10 programming averaged an alarming 14.69 instances of violence. 
• 56  percent  of  all  violence  on  prime  time  network  television  during  the  2005– 
• For each hour of prime time, CBS had the highest percentage of deaths depicted 
on  screen  during  the  2005–2006  season.  During  the  8  o’clock  hour,  66  percent 
of violent scenes depicted a death. During the 9 o’clock and 10 o’clock hours 68 
percent of violent scenes depicted a death. 
• Across  the  board,  54  percent  of  violent  scenes  contained  either  a  depiction  of 
death  (13  percent)  or  an  implied  death  (41  percent)  during  the  2005–2006  sea-
son. 

2006 season was person-on-person violence. 

Question  3.  In  1990,  Congress  passed  the  Television  Program  Improvement  Act. 
It  provided  antitrust  immunity  to  the  television  industry  to  allow  the  networks  to 
meet and agree on voluntary programming standards. The networks agreed to note 
before  violent  programming,  that  ‘‘due  to  some  violent  content,  parental  discretion 
is advised.’’ Is this warning sufficient? 

Answer.  The  Television  Program  Improvement  Act  specifically  limited  the  tem-
porary antitrust exception it created to ‘‘any joint discussion for the purpose of . . . 
developing  and  disseminating  voluntary  guidelines  designed  to  alleviate  the  nega-
tive  impact  of  violence  in  telecast  material,’’  and  not  merely  general  programming 
standards,  so  it  is  clear  that  the  problem  of  television  violence  has  been  grappled 
with by policymakers for decades. This past television season alone featured violent 
content like a man having a power drill thrust into his back, a finger being severed 
using  a  cigar  clipper,  a  bag  of  heroin  being  cut  out  of  the  bowels  of  a  cadaver,  and 
almost innumerable depictions of violent death and dismemberment. 

To  answer  your  question  directly,  Mr.  Chairman,  no,  this  warning  is  not  suffi-
cient.  The  only  way  a  viewer  would  see  that  warning  is  if  they  watched  the  show 
from its beginning—or—from when the last commercial break ended. With the ubiq-
uity  of  remote  control  devices  in  homes  today,  hardly  a  program  goes  by  without 
‘‘channel  surfing’’  to  see  what  else  is  on  another  channel.  Consequently,  it  cannot 
be  argued  that  a  mere  3  second  warning  prior  to  the  airing  of  graphic  violent  con-
tent is a sufficient solution to protect children from such programming.

Question.  Much  of  the  hearing  focused  on  violent  programming,  and  what  we 
should do about that. I would like to focus on another source of television violence— 
the commercials. 

Often  times,  it  seems  that  the  commercials  contain  just  as  much  violence  as  the 
actual  television  programming  that  they  are  funding.  Furthermore,  with  commer-
cials,  parents  have  very  little  control  over  what  their  children  are  seeing.  Unlike

programming,  they  don’t  know  the  general  content  of  commercials  in  advance,  and 
the commercials are not rated or subject to blocking by the V-Chip. 

So, I would like to ask the members of the panel—what can we do to help parents 

who want to control the level of violence in commercials? 

Answer. Senator, I wish to thank you for raising this question. It is of critical im-
portance  and  it  reflects  the  flood  of  questions  and  comments  we  receive  each  and 
every day from members of the public across the United States. 

First,  I  think  it  is  important  to  distinguish  (a)  commercial  advertisements  pur-
chased by sponsors, from (b) the promotional advertising the networks run for their 
own upcoming TV programs. With regard to the former, we are seeing a disturbing 
trend towards more graphic violence in television commercials, especially for motion 
picture  and  video  game  advertisements.  Those  commercials  tend  to  highlight  some 
of  the  most  graphic  scenes  or  instances  present  in  the  film  or  game  being  adver-
tised.  Though  violent  commercials  are  a  concern,  we  hear  far  more  public  outrage 
at  the  increased  sexual  content  on  television  commercials.  Clearly  violent  content 
and sexual content are both problematic in paid advertising today. 

An  even  greater  problem  for  families  is  the  promotional  advertising  run  by  the 
TV networks to highlight their other upcoming programs. It is common for network 
promotions highlighting violent programs that typically run in later time slots to be 
aired  earlier  in  the  day,  and  many  10  p.m.  programs  are  promoted  heavily  during 
the 8 p.m. ‘‘Family Hour’’. As a result, promotional spots that show graphically vio-
lent scenes are often aired during the prime time hour when children are most like-
ly to be in the audience. 

You correctly state that commercials are not rated and are therefore not blockable 
using the current TV ratings system. Commercials—and network promotions—must 
be  rated  in  precisely  the  same  manner  as  the  programs  being  aired  if  the  V-Chip 
or  other  blocking  devices  are  to  work.  But  I  assure  you  that  the  industry  will  balk 
at  doing  anything  that  might  prevent  its  paying  sponsor  from  having  its  advertise-
ment blocked by any means. Regardless of ratings, the TV networks must use great-
er care in the cross-promotion of adult-themed programs. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. MARK PRYOR TO 

TIMOTHY F. WINTER 

Question.  I  believe  that  one  of  the  problems  we  will  have  with  the  use  of  the  V- 
Chip  is  that  parents  don’t  realize  the  subtle  impact  that  programming  has  on  chil-
dren, and, therefore, the hassle of using the V-chip devalues it use. I also think that 
the current V-chip technology doesn’t take into account that many families have all 
household  members,  of  all  ages  using  the  same  equipment.  What  is  suitable  for  a 
five-year old, doesn’t work for your ten-year old, or doesn’t work for the parent. 

The  V-chip,  to  me,  would  be  convenient  as  a  one  time  process  or  for  a  periodical 
update but not as a daily or weekly tool for parents to employ. Even with the indus-
try’s  recent  campaign  about  the  availability  of  the  V-chip,  the  Kaiser  Foundation 
has found only a modest improvement in the use of the parental block. In 2004, the 
KFF found that 15 percent of parents have used the V-Chip. In 2007, the KFF found 
that 16 percent of parents say they have ever used the V-Chip to block objectionable 
programming. 

Although  82  percent  of  parents  now  say  that  they  have  purchased  a  new  tele-
vision  since  January  1,  2000,  more  than  half  (57  percent)  are  not  aware  that  they 
have a V-Chip. For years, there has been talk about adding the so-called ‘‘V’’ button 
to  the  remote  of  the  equipment,  but  I  understand  that  manufacturers  have  ex-
pressed concern about the cost of adding the button and room for the button on the 
remote.  I  brought  four  remotes  with  me  to  the  hearing,  and  they  all  have  lots  of 
buttons but only one—TiVo—offers a parental control button. 

I  would  like  to  hear  from  each  member  of  the  panel  about  the  strengths  and 

weaknesses of the V-chip and on the merits of the V-button. 

Answer.  Senator  Pryor,  the  PTC  favors  any  tool  that  is  of  real  help  to  parents 
in  shielding  their  children  from  graphic  and  explicit  content.  However,  the  current 
TV  ratings  system  and  the  V-Chip  technology  that  is  dependent  upon  them  are  of 
no real use to parents because the producers of TV content rate their own program-
ming. As a result, they have a built-in disincentive to accurately rate shows for fear 
of losing either audience or advertisers. 

Furthermore,  research  by  the  PTC  and  corroborated  by  the  Kaiser  Family  Foun-
dation  and  others  has  demonstrated  that  the  ratings  assigned  to  programming  by 
the  networks  are  inaccurate  as  much  as  60–80  percent  percent  of  the  time.  A  full 
two-thirds  of  programming  examined  just  last  year  lacked  the  appropriate  content 
descriptors  to  warn  parents  of  sexual  content,  sexual  dialogue,  violence  and  coarse 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00112 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

language. So even if parents did exactly what the entertainment industry asks them 
to  do  by  employing  the  TV  ratings  and  V-Chip  technology,  not  a  single  child  would 
have been protected from exposure to the shows that lacked the appropriate content 
descriptors. 

As you point out, in addition to the failings of the industry-controlled ratings sys-
tem, the technology itself is often difficult to employ. Despite the availability of the 
V-Chip,  the  process  of  activating  it  differs  by  each  television  manufacturer  and  on 
each  set.  That  is  at  least  part  of  the  reason  why  recent  polling  indicates  that  only 
16  percent  of  parents  had  ever  used  the  V-Chip,  and  far  fewer  use  it  on  a  regular 
basis.  I  am  intrigued  by  your  idea  about  a  V-Button  and  would  like  to  understand 
more. 

TiVo is to be commended not only for its one-button approach to parental control 
technology,  but  also  for  TiVo  KidZone  which  enables  parents  to  use  a  number  of 
third-party  ratings  systems  to  find  appropriate  programs  for  their  children  as  well 
as block inappropriate shows. (In full disclosure, we are partners with TiVo on their 
KidZone feature.) 

If the V-Chip and the V-button are to be of any value, the underlying content rat-
ing  system  must  be  thorough  and  accurate.  There  are  six  (6)  critical  issues  related 
to  the  content  rating  system  which  must  be  addressed  if  any  blocking  device  is  to 
work properly: 

1.  The  content  ratings  must  be  determined  independently,  not  by  the  networks 
themselves who are financially motivated by its failure; 
2. The program content must be fully and transparently disclosed; 
3.  There  must  be  a  consequence  if  ratings  are  intentionally  incorrect  or  mis-
leading, and there must be a clear solution in place for public complaint; 
4.  The  ratings  system  must  be  consistent,  not  just  across  each  network  but 
across the entire medium; 
5. Network program promotions and TV commercials must be rated; 
6.  The  ratings  system  should  be  a  universal  system  that  crosses  all  electronic 
media: motion pictures, television, video games, music lyrics, internet, etc. 

If the television industry as a whole moved toward easier, more effective blocking 

technology, it would be welcomed by millions of concerned parents. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

LAURENCE H. TRIBE 

Question  1.  This  month  (June  2007)  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  found  that 
only 16 percent of parents have even used the V-Chip. In an earlier report, the Kai-
ser  Family  Foundation  found  that  many  shows  containing  violence  did  not  receive 
a  violent  content  rating.  This  raises  serious  questions  about  whether  the  V-Chip  is 
an  effective  way  for  parents  to  block  shows  containing  violence.  Do  you  think  that 
the  V-Chip  is  an  adequate  tool  for  preventing  children  from  viewing  violent  pro-
gramming? 

Answer.  The  V-chip  is  one  of  many  tools  that  parents  may  use  to  prevent  their 
children  from  viewing  programming  that  parents  deem  too  violent  or  otherwise  in-
appropriate.  My  testimony  focused  on,  and  my  expertise  is  limited  to,  the  constitu-
tional  validity  of  proposed  programming  regulation.  For  that  reason,  I  cannot  offer 
an informed opinion regarding whether parents and others view the V-chip as ‘‘ade-
quate’’  in  some  psychological  or  sociological  sense.  I  can  say,  however,  that  the  V- 
chip not only is ‘‘adequate’’ but is indeed preferred from a constitutional law perspec-
tive  because,  unlike  certain  proposed  regulations,  the  V-chip  offers  parents  choice 
rather  than  centrally  imposing  any  content-based  restriction  on  the  speech  that 
they, their children, or others are free to receive or to communicate. 

The  fact  that  parents  reportedly  do  not  use  the  V-chip  as  frequently  as  some 
would  like  is  immaterial  to  whether  the  V-chip  is  a  constitutionally  preferred  tool 
for parents. Indeed, as I pointed out in my testimony, from a constitutional perspec-
tive, alternatives need not be widely used—only available to those who choose to use 
them—in  order  to  count  as  ‘‘less  restrictive  alternatives’’  that  render  unconstitu-
tional any governmental attempt to directly regulate the speech in question. In the 
Playboy  case,  for  example,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  availability  of 
channel  blocking  was  sufficient  to  make  channel  blocking  a  constitutionally  pre-
ferred ‘‘less restrictive alternative,’’ even though it was then used by fewer than 0.5 
percent of cable subscribers. 

I  would  also  point  out  that  the  level  of  V-chip  use  reported  in  the  Kaiser  Family 
Foundation study does not support imposing additional government regulations that

would abridge First Amendment speech rights. The Kaiser report found that, of par-
ents  who  have  used  the  V-chip,  89  percent  found  it  useful—including  71  percent 
who  found  it  ‘‘very  useful’’—in  blocking  shows  they  did  not  want  their  children  to 
watch.  Of  parents  who  have  television  sets  with  the  V-chip  and  have  not  used  it, 
50  percent  say  they  haven’t  used  the  V-chip  because  ‘‘an  adult  is  usually  nearby 
when  [their]  children  watch  TV,’’  and  an  additional  14  percent  say  they  have  not 
used  the  V-chip  because  they  ‘‘trust  [their]  children  to  make  their  own  decisions.’’ 
The report also found that 25 percent of parents have used cable or satellite paren-
tal controls other than the V-chip to block content they did not want their children 
to watch. 

Question 2. Are you comfortable with the level of violence on television today? 
Answer.  I  cannot  offer  a  meaningful  answer  to  this  question  because,  as  I  ex-
plained  at  considerable  length  in  my  testimony,  I  have  no  idea  what  you,  or  any 
other  lawmakers  or  regulators,  might  mean  by  the  term  ‘‘violence,’’  especially  in  a 
context  where  the  concern  is  not  so  much  with  ‘‘violence’’  as  such  as  it  is  with  the 
way in which ‘‘violence’’ is being depicted—whether it is being reported factually or 
sanitized and/or glorified, whether it is being used to shock or to inform or to enter-
tain or to warn or to frighten, and, more generally, what it is being used to express. 
Nor  is  this  problem  the  result  of  any  lack  of  effort  or  imagination,  on  your  part  or 
mine. I meant just what I said when I testified that I do not believe anyone is capa-
ble  of  crafting  a  meaningful  definition  of  what  constitutes  impermissible  violence 
without  triggering  grave  constitutional  concerns,  especially  when  one  recognizes 
that  laws  regulating  speech  must  be  particularly  clear  as  well  as  viewpoint-neutral 
in order to be constitutional. I do not believe that impermissible violence can be de-
fined in a way that would withstand constitutional scrutiny. 

Question  3.  In  1990,  Congress  passed  the  Television  Program  Improvement  Act. 
It  provided  antitrust  immunity  to  the  television  industry  to  allow  the  networks  to 
meet and agree on voluntary programming standards. The networks agreed to note 
before  violent  programming,  that  ‘‘due  to  some  violent  content,  parental  discretion 
is advised.’’ Is this warning sufficient? 

Answer. Whether this particular warning language is ‘‘sufficient’’ to alert a viewer 
regarding a particular program’s content is obviously outside my area of expertise— 
although I would note that the Kaiser Family Foundation report found that 89 per-
cent  of  parents  say  that  current  TV  ratings  have  been  useful  (including  49  percent 
who  say  ‘‘very  useful’’)  in  guiding  their  families’  viewing  choices,  and  that  these 
warnings  are  used  in  addition  to  the  program  ratings  that  are  recognized  by  the 
V-chip.  The  important  point—and  the  point  that  is  within  my  expertise—is  that 
truly industry-based and industry-generated (rather than government-based or gov-
ernment-generated)  solutions  that  empower  parents  to  make  decisions  with  respect 
to  the  programming  their  children  will  view—such  as  the  voluntary  warning  lan-
guage quoted above—present no constitutional problem, in sharp contrast to any at-
tempt at direct government regulation of content.

who want to control the level of violence in commercials? 

Answer. My testimony focused on the constitutional validity of proposed program-
ming regulations. Several of the constitutionally preferred alternatives discussed in 
my  testimony  can  help  parents  restrict  the  access  of  their  children  to  commercials 
that they believe contain excessive or otherwise inappropriate or gratuitous violence. 
These  options  include  (i)  using  the  V-chip  or  on-screen  guides  to  block  programs  or 
channels  in  which  violent  commercials  have  appeared  in  the  past;  (ii)  subscribing 
to  ‘‘family-friendly’’  programming  options  such  as  DIRECTV’s  Family  Choice  Plan, 
in which such commercials typically do not appear, (iii) permitting children to watch 
only those programs and commercials that have been pre-recorded with a time-shift-
ing  technology  such  as  a  VCR  or  DVR,  (iv)  using  timers  that  allow  televisions  to

work  only  at  certain  times  of  the  day  when  such  commercials  are  less  likely  to  ap-

weaknesses of the V-chip and on the merits of the V-button. 

Answer.  From  my  perspective,  and  within  the  limits  of  my  legal  expertise,  the 
strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  V-chip  or  V-button  turn  on  whether  these  tools 
offer  constitutionally  valid  means  to  achieve  the  government’s  goal  of  protecting 
children  from  certain  allegedly  ‘‘violent’’  programming.  As  addressed  in  my  testi-
mony,  the  V-chip  is  an  effective  tool  because  it  permits  parents  to  block  program-
ming that they do not want their children to view. The ‘‘V-button’’ may provide an-
other equally effective alternative. The V-chip (or the V-button) may not be used as 
frequently  as  some  would  like,  but  this  does  not  mean  that  these  tools  are  ineffec-
tive, at least from a constitutional law perspective. Any perceived congressional con-
cerns over how often parents use the V-chip cannot justify the imposition of central-
ized restrictions on speech—restrictions that, for reasons I explained in detail in my 
testimony,  could  not  be  squared  with  the  First  Amendment’s  strict  requirements  of 
narrowness, precision, and viewpoint-neutrality. That said, I think it might be use-
ful for me to point out that the Kaiser report found that, of parents who have used 
the V-chip, 89 percent found it useful—including 71 percent who found it ‘‘very use-
ful’’—in  blocking  shows  they  did  not  want  their  children  to  watch.  Of  parents  who 
have  television  sets  with  the  V-chip  and  have  not  used  it,  50  percent  say  they 
haven’t  used  the  V-chip  because  ‘‘an  adult  is  usually  nearby  when  [their]  children

they ‘‘trust [their] children to make their own decisions.’’ The report also found that

only 16 percent of parents have even used the V-Chip. In an earlier report, the Kai-
ser  Family  Foundation  found  that  many  shows  containing  violence  did  not  receive

gramming? 

Answer. In order for the V-chip to function effectively at limiting children’s expo-
sure  to  sensitive  material  on  television,  it  is  essential  that  programming  be  rated 
accurately. The existing evidence that offers an independent evaluation of the accu-
racy, or validity, of the television’s industry rating practices suggests that many vio-
lent programs are ‘‘underrated.’’ By this, I mean that applicable content codes, such 
as ‘‘V’’ for violence, are not applied where they are warranted. There is also evidence 

VerDate Nov 24 2008  12:41 Nov 01, 2012 Jkt 075679 PO 00000 Frm 00115 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 S:\GPO\DOCS\SCST0626 JACKIE

112 

from parent surveys indicating that many parents judge that V-chip ratings applied 
to  programs  are  often  too  lenient,  and  that  they  would  assign  more  restrictive  rat-
ings to the content in question. When parents lack confidence in the accuracy of the 
ratings,  it  undercuts  the  utility  of  the  V-chip  system  and  diminishes  its  value  as 
an  effective  tool  for  addressing  concern  about  children’s  exposure  to  television  vio-
lence. 

Question 2. Are you comfortable with the level of violence on television today? 
Answer.  Not  all  violence  on  television  is  the  same  in  terms  of  its  risk  of  harmful 
effects  on  child-viewers.  Because  of  that  axiom,  it  is  important  to  frame  one’s  con-
cern with the patterns of violent content in a manner that places greater emphasis 
on  the  nature  of  the  depictions  than  on  the  sheer  amount  or  volume  of  violent  por-
trayals.  Thus,  the  key  question  is  not  simply  whether  the  level  of  violence  on  tele-
vision  is  high  or  low,  but  rather,  whether  most  violence  is  presented  in  ways  that 
are likely to contribute to adverse effects from exposure. Evidence from the National 
Television  Violence  Study,  which  examined  roughly  10,000  programs  over  a  three- 
year period, demonstrates that most televised violence is highly formulaic, and that 
the consistent pattern of portrayals does indeed enhance the risk of harmful effects 
on  children.  Given  this  evidence,  I  cannot  be  comfortable  with  the  presentation  of 
violence on entertainment television in the U.S., and indeed harbor substantial con-
cerns about its risk of harmful effects on children. 

Question  3.  In  1990,  Congress  passed  the  Television  Program  Improvement  Act. 
It  provided  antitrust  immunity  to  the  television  industry  to  allow  the  networks  to 
meet and agree on voluntary programming standards. The networks agreed to note 
before  violent  programming,  that  ‘‘due  to  some  violent  content,  parental  discretion 
is advised.’’ Is this warning sufficient? 

Answer.  I  should  first  note  that  since  the  advent  of  the  V-chip,  the  use  of  warn-
ings or advisories to alert parents to violent material on television is extremely rare. 
Because  of  that  fact,  researchers  have  not  actively  pursued  studies  to  determine 
their  impact.  My  sense  is  that  such  warnings  would  hold  limited  utility  given  that 
the majority of children age 7 and older have television sets in their bedrooms, and 
frequently view without any parental supervision.

to ask the members of the panel—what can we do to help parents who want to con-
trol the level of violence in commercials? 

Answer.  Under  the  rubric  of  ‘‘commercials,’’  I  suspect  that  you  mean  to  include 
promotional  messages  for  future  programming.  While  some  product  commercials 
may include violent depictions, it is much more common for program promotions to 
present  short  excerpts  of  intense  violent  scenes  as  an  ‘‘attention-grabber’’  meant  to 
increase  audiences  for  the  advertised  program.  Such  material  is  often  included  in 
sports  programming  viewed  by  substantial  numbers  of  children,  as  well  as  in  most 
other  program  contexts  with  the  exception  of  children’s  programs.  Given  that  most 
children over the age of 5–6 years spend the majority of their television time watch-
ing  programs  intended  for  older  audiences,  there  is  a  significant  risk  that  children 
will be exposed to violence in these contexts on a regular basis. 

No  policy  exists  to  assist  parents  in  limiting  their  children’s  exposure  to  violence 
in non-program content such as commercials or program promotions. In the absence 
of  any  such  policy,  one  can  only  implore  the  television  industry  to  exercise  greater 
self-restraint  in  its  use  of  violent  depictions  to  promote  programs  and  other  violent 
media products (e.g., films, video games).

Question.  I  believe  that  one  of  the  problems  we  will  have  with  the  use  of  the  V- 
chip  is  that  parents  don’t  realize  the  subtle  impact  that  programming  has  on  chil-

dren, and, therefore, the hassle of using the V-chip devalues it use. I also think that 
the current V-chip technology doesn’t take into account that many families have all 
household  members,  of  all  ages  using  the  same  equipment.  What  is  suitable  for  a 
five-year old, doesn’t work for your ten-year old, or doesn’t work for the parent. 

The  V-chip,  to  me,  would  be  convenient  as  a  one  time  process  or  for  a  periodical 
update but not as a daily or weekly tool for parents to employ. Even with the indus-
try’s  recent  campaign  about  the  availability  of  the  V-chip,  the  Kaiser  Foundation 
has found only a modest improvement in the use of the parental block. In 2004, the 
KFF found that 15 percent of parents have used the V-Chip. In 2007, the KFF found 
that 16 percent of parents say they have ever used the V-Chip to block objectionable 
programming. 

Although  82  percent  of  parents  now  say  that  they  have  purchased  a  new  tele-
vision  since  January  1,  2000,  more  than  half  (57  percent)  are  not  aware  that  they 
have a V-Chip. For years, there has been talk about adding the so-called ‘‘V’’ button 
to  the  remote  of  the  equipment,  but  I  understand  that  manufacturers  have  ex-
pressed concern about the cost of adding the button and room for the button on the 
remote.  I  brought  four  remotes  with  me  to  the  hearing,  and  they  all  have  lots  of 
buttons but only one—TiVo—offers a parental control button. 

I  would  like  to  hear  from  each  member  of  the  panel  about  the  strengths  and 

weaknesses of the V-chip and on the merits of the V-button. 

Answer. In my estimation, the greatest impact of the V-chip lies more in its exist-
ence than in its actual use. What I mean by this is that while relatively few parents 
actively employ it, most parents are aware that it exists. And its existence is likely 
to serve as a cue or reminder to parents that there are substantial amounts of mate-
rial  on  television  that  are  inappropriate  for  children.  It  is  likely  that  the  advent  of 
the V-chip has increased parents’ sensitivity to the need to supervise their children’s 
media  exposure,  even  if  they  do  not  choose  to  exercise  that  responsibility  via  the 
V-chip’s blocking technology. 

You  are  likely  aware  that  there  is  no  single  uniform  protocol  for  activating  the 
V-chip in the same way across all models of television receivers. Rather, each manu-
facturer  requires  different  commands  in  different  sequences  using  different  buttons 
or features on the remote control device to implement the V-chip blocking capability. 
It typically requires significant user effort, including consulting the product manual, 
to activate the V-chip technology on most television sets. I have little doubt that V- 
chip  usage  by  parents  would  increase  significantly  if  it  were  possible  to  utilize  the 
technology  simply  with  the  push  of  a  single  button  that  was  clearly  marked  on  all 
TVs and/or remote control devices. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE TO 

PETER LIGUORI 

Question  1.  This  month  (June  2007)  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  found  that 
only 16 percent of parents have even used the V-Chip. In an earlier report, the Kai-
ser  Family  Foundation  found  that  many  shows  containing  violence  did  not  receive 
a  violent  content  rating.  This  raises  serious  questions  about  whether  the  V-Chip  is 
an  effective  way  for  parents  to  block  shows  containing  violence.  Do  you  think  that 
the  V-Chip  is  an  adequate  tool  for  preventing  children  from  viewing  violent  pro-
gramming? 

Answer.  The  V-Chip  is  a  very  effective  and  powerful  tool  to  aid  parents  in  their 
efforts  to  block  any  unwanted  programming,  including  violence,  from  coming  into 
the  home.  It  allows  parents  to  block  shows  based  on  an  age-based  rating,  such  as 
TV–PG  or  TV–14,  or  based  on  content  descriptors,  such  as  ‘‘S’’  for  sexual  content, 
‘‘L’’ for language, or ‘‘V’’ for violence. 

According  to  a  survey  released  by  the  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  in  June  2007, 
71  percent  of  parents  who  used  the  V-Chip  found  the  system  very  useful,  clearly 
demonstrating the blocking tool’s effectiveness. Additionally, most parents said that 
they  knew  about  TV  ratings  (81  percent)  and  the  V-Chip  (70  percent),  with  one- 
third  of  parents  understanding  the  ‘‘S’’  rating,  and  one-half  of  parents  compre-
hending the ‘‘V’’ rating. 

TV Watch—the leading national organization that promotes parental controls and 
individual  choice  as  an  alternative  to  increased  government  regulation  of  TV  con-
tent—released additional survey information and data in June 2007 that are worth 
noting: 

• 73  percent  of  parents  monitor  what  their  children  watch,  including  87  percent 

of parents whose children are ages 0–10.

• 86  percent  of  parents  believe  that  more  parental  involvement  is  the  best  way 

to keep kids from viewing television shows that are rated beyond their ages. 

• 83  percent  of  parents  are  satisfied  with  the  effectiveness  of  the  V-Chip  and 

other blocking tools. 

controls. 

As  this  survey  shows,  one  of  the  most  effective  and  widely-used  tools  is  parental 

Finally, it is also important to recognize that the V-Chip is just one of many tools 
available to parents. Cable and satellite television, subscribed to by roughly 86 per-
cent  of  U.S.  households,  offer  a  wide  array  of  parental  controls.  With  certain  set- 
top devices, parents have the ability to filter content based on TV ratings or MPAA 
ratings.  Parents  can  also  block  particular  channels,  titles,  time  slots,  or  even  de-
scriptions  contained  in  interactive  guides.  DIRECTV  and  Echostar,  as  well  as  the 
top three cable operators, offer ‘‘family-friendly’’ tiers. Parents can use other techno-
logical tools and devices to gain access to appropriate content; for example, parents 
can  use  Digital  Video  Recorders  (DVRs)  to  create  a  library  of  programs  acceptable 
for their children. An exhaustive list of tools is set forth in a recent survey by Adam 
Thierer, Senior Fellow and Director, Center for Digital Media Freedom, Progress & 
Freedom  Foundation,  ‘‘Parental  Controls  and  Online  Child  Protection:  A  Survey  of 
Tools  and  Methods’’  (A  copy  of  this  report  is  retained  in  Committee  files  and  is 
available online at http://www.pff.org/parentalcontrols/1). 

We  understand  your  concern  about  the  use  of  content  descriptors,  and  realize 
there is always room for improvement. In that regard, FOX is currently engaged in 
an internal review of the process in which it rates TV shows across all of our compa-
nies, including the FOX Network, MyNetworkTV, and our cable channels. Moreover, 
we are working with our broadcast and cable colleagues to improve the consistency 
of ratings across channels. You have our assurance that we are continually working 
toward  the  goal  of  ensuring  that  the  V-Chip  is  the  most  reliable  system  available. 

Question 2. Are you comfortable with the level of violence on television today? 
Answer.  We  believe  that  the  quality  of  programming  on  television  today  is  at  an 
all-time  high.  On  FOX,  we  have  a  great  mix  of  programming—from  family-friendly 
shows, such as ‘‘American Idol’’ and ‘‘Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?’’ to com-
pelling, critically-acclaimed dramas, such as ‘‘House’’ and ‘‘Prison Break.’’ 

Personally, I am satisfied that the level of violence on television today is carefully 
measured  and  labeled  by  the  tools  available  to  assist  parents  in  monitoring  their 
children’s viewing of television programs. 

As the parent of a 13-year old and a 15-year old, I personally understand the im-
portant role that parents and these tools play. I am constantly evaluating shows to 
ensure  that  they  are  appropriate  for  my  children’s  ages  and  maturity  levels.  There 
are  shows  on  television  that  I  simply  do  not  allow  them  to  watch,  including  shows 
that FOX airs. The parental control device, such as the V-Chip, is an excellent way 
for  parents  to  demarcate  television  viewing  by  children  based  on  their  own  par-
ticular values and judgments. 

Question  3.  In  1990,  Congress  passed  the  Television  Program  Improvement  Act. 
It  provided  antitrust  immunity  to  the  television  industry  to  allow  the  networks  to 
meet and agree on voluntary programming standards. The networks agreed to note 
before  violent  programming,  that  ‘‘due  to  some  violent  content,  parental  discretion 
is advised.’’ Is this warning sufficient? 

Answer.  We  have  learned  through  ongoing  contact  with  various  interest  groups 
that  parents  find  the  advisories  extremely  helpful.  We  at  FOX  take  seriously  our 
responsibility  to  use  on-screen  advisories,  as  well  as  many  other  ways,  to  inform 
viewers  about  the  content  of  our  programs.  We  have  a  large  department  of  Broad-
cast Standards professionals, who are charged with ensuring that our shows comply 
with  the  law  and  our  own  stringent  internal  standards.  These  Standards  profes-
sionals  are  involved  at  every  step  in  the  development,  production  and  broadcast  of 
our  entertainment  programming.  They  meticulously  review  more  than  500  hours  of 
programming  and  tens  of  thousands  of  commercials  every  year.  They  are  also  re-
sponsible for rating each episode of every show, providing both an age-based rating, 
such  as  TV–PG  or  TV–14,  and  content  descriptors  where  necessary  (‘‘S’’  for  sexual 
content, ‘‘L’’ for language, or ‘‘V’’ for violence). 

These ratings are aired at the commencement of every program on our networks, 
and  after  each  commercial  break.  When  appropriate,  we  also  place  an  additional, 
full  screen  advisory  at  the  start  of  the  program  to  provide  a  warning  to  parents  to 
pay  close  attention  before  they  allow  their  kids  to  tune  in.  Moreover,  many  tele-
vision sets and cable satellite set-top televisions provide age-based ratings and con-
tent descriptors on the program guides and display screens, even during commercial 
breaks.

We  air  public  service  announcements  (PSAs)  as  part  of  an  industry-wide  media 
campaign  that  urges  parents  to  take  charge  of  their  children’s  TV  viewing.  PSAs 
are  run  in  prime  time,  during  some  of  our  most  popular  shows,  such  as  ‘‘American 
Idol.’’ This PSA campaign refers parents to a website—www.TheTVBoss.org—where 
we  provide  detailed  information  about  parental  controls  and  the  TV  rating  system. 
We  take  all  these  steps  to  help  parents  make  informed  viewing  decisions.  To-

gether, these actions are very effective. 

Question 4. Back in 2004, the National Association of Broadcasters held a Summit 
on Responsible Programming. As I understand it, this was an effort by broadcasters 
to take positive steps to address concerns of parents and policymakers about things 
like  violent  and  indecent  programming.  What  new  initiatives  came  from  this  exer-
cise? What effect did this effort have on industry efforts to address violent program-
ming? 

Answer.  Following  the  Responsible  Programming  Summit,  the  National  Associa-
tion of Broadcasters (NAB) and its members, as well as other broadcasters and net-
works,  held  a  series  of  meetings  to  discuss  concerns  about  broadcast  programming. 
A number of those discussions focused on promoting ways for parents to take charge 
of what their children view on television. As a result of those discussions, individual 
broadcasters  and  station  groups  have  focused  directly  on  specific  safeguards  that 
could  be  put  in  place  to  prevent  inappropriate  material  from  being  aired,  including 
delay  buttons  and  other  review  systems  and  processes.  The  Summit  resulted  in  a 
renewed, voluntary commitment by broadcasters across the country to monitor more 
closely  both  their  live  and  recorded  content.  Today,  as  result  of  these  efforts  and 
more diligent oversight, there have been few, if any, problems. 

Following  the  Summit,  the  broadcast  industry  has  examined  the  history  and  use 
of the V-Chip and program ratings system, and has concluded that additional indus-
try  efforts  should  be  undertaken  to  improve  consumer  awareness  of  these  parental 
controls.  The  NAB,  broadcast  networks,  the  Motion  Picture  Association  of  America, 
the  National  Cable  &  Telecommunications  Association,  the  Consumer  Electronics 
Association,  DIRECTV  and  Echostar,  the  Ad  Council  and  others  joined  a  campaign 
to  educate  parents  on  how  they  can  better  monitor  and  supervise  their  children’s 
television  consumption.  Broadcast  television  and  radio  stations  and  cable/satellite 
channels have run, and continue to run, a number of PSAs about parental controls. 
These PSAs further direct viewers and listeners to www.TheTVBoss.org, where they 
can learn more about the V-Chip and cable and satellite technologies to better con-
trol the television programming coming into their homes. 

RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTION SUBMITTED BY HON. BILL NELSON TO 

PETER LIGUORI 

Question.  Much  of  the  hearing  focused  on  violent  programming,  and  what  we 
should do about that. I would like to focus on another source of television violence— 
the  commercials.  Often  times,  it  seems  that  the  commercials  contain  just  as  much 
violence  as  the  actual  television  programming  that  they  are  funding.  Furthermore, 
with commercials, parents have very little control over what their children are see-
ing. Unlike programming, they don’t know the general content of commercials in ad-
vance,  and  the  commercials  are  not  rated  or  subject  to  blocking  by  the  V-Chip.  So, 
I would like to ask the members of the panel—what can we do to help parents who 
want to control the level of violence in commercials? 

Answer.  First  of  all,  our  Standards  department  reviews  every  commercial  before 
it  airs.  We  review  tens  of  thousands  of  commercials  each  year.  Moreover,  we  take 
into  account  the  product  being  advertised  when  deciding  what  time  and  on  what 
show it should air. 

The  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  has  also  weighed  in  on  the  issue  of  mar-
keting violent entertainment products to children. The FTC has approved guidelines 
for  the  television  industry,  so  that  no  violent  entertainment  products  are  marketed 
on  programs  where  35  percent  or  more  children  are  in  the  audience.  We  have  fol-
lowed this guideline.

equipment for all household members. What is suitable for a five-year old, does not 
work for a ten-year old, or may not be of interest to an adult. 

The  V-Chip,  to  me,  would  be  convenient  as  a  one-time  process  or  for  a  periodical 
update but not as a daily or weekly tool for parents to employ. Even with the indus-
try’s  recent  campaign  about  the  availability  of  the  V-Chip,  the  Kaiser  Foundation 
(KFF)  found  only  a  modest  improvement  in  the  use  of  this  tool.  In  2004,  the  KFF 
found that 15 percent of parents installed the V-Chip. In 2007, the KFF found that 
16 percent of parents have used the V-Chip to block objectionable programming. 

Although  82  percent  of  parents  now  say  that  they  have  purchased  a  new  tele-
vision  since  January  1,  2000,  more  than  half  (57  percent)  are  not  aware  that  their 
sets  have  V-Chip  technology.  For  years,  there  has  been  talk  about  adding  the  so- 
called  ‘‘V’’  button  to  the  remote  of  the  equipment,  but  I  understand  that  manufac-
turers have expressed concern about the cost of adding the button and room for the 
button on the remote. I have brought four remotes with me to this hearing, and they 
have lots of buttons. Only one button—TiVo—offers parental control.I would like to 
hear  from  each  member  of  the  panel  about  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  V- 
Chip and on the merits of the V-button. 

Answer. The V-Chip has several strengths. First of all, it is ubiquitous. Every tel-
evision—13  inches  or  larger  manufactured  since  2000—is  equipped  with  a  V-Chip. 
While we recognize that there are still televisions in use that were purchased prior 
to 2000, that number will decrease over time, making V-Chip availability truly uni-
versal.  Moreover,  the  V-Chip  is  easy  to  program.  Once  it  has  been  programmed,  it 
will  work  every  time.  The  strength  of  the  V-Chip  is  that  it  allows  for  parental  dis-
cretion  and  flexibility,  where  parents  can  block  programming  based  on  the  aged- 
based  rating  system,  such  TV–PG  or  TV–14,  or  based  on  content  descriptors,  such 
as  ‘‘V’’  for  violence  or  ‘‘S’’  for  sex.  Parents  then  have  the  ability  to  remove  V-Chip 
restrictions  when  they  sit  down  to  watch  television  programming  after  their  chil-
dren have gone to bed. We recognize that each household is not the same; some par-
ents,  for  example,  may  find  subjects  related  to  sex  more  objectionable  than  those 
to  violence,  or  vice  versa.  The  V-Chip  gives  parents  the  ability  to  choose  what  con-
tent their children can and cannot view. 

In addition to the V-Chip, parental controls are offered by cable and satellite pro-
viders.  For  example,  DirecTV  allow  parents  to  block  shows  based  on  TV  ratings, 
MPAA ratings, time slots, titles, or channels. Parents also have the ability to block 
unrated  programs  and  filter  objectionable  program  descriptions  on  the  interactive 
guide. As I noted in one of my answers above, there is an exhaustive list of techno-
logical tools set forth in a recent survey by Adam Thierer of the Progress & Freedom 
Foundation.  Because  of  the  way  the  V-Chip  works,  the  ratings  system  cannot  be 
modified  without  disenfranchising  all  of  the  television  sets  currently  in  viewers’ 
homes. Any changes could only be incorporated in TV sets sold at some future date.
