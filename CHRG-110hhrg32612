2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  Tuesday,  January  30,  2007  the  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment  of
the  Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  hold  a  hearing  to  receive  testimony
on H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act.

H.R.  547  directs  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  and  the  National  Institute  of
Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  to  initiate  a  research,  development,  and  dem-
onstration  program  to  make  alternative  bio-based  fuels  more  compatible  with
present-day  infrastructure.  H.R.  547  also  directs  these  agencies  to  develop  tech-
nologies  and  methods  to  provide  low-cost,  portable,  and  accurate  measurements  of
sulfur  in  fuels,  and  to  develop  a  physical  properties  database  and  Standards  Ref-
erence Materials for alternative fuels.

Science  and  Technology  Committee  Chairman  Bart  Gordon  introduced  H.R.  547
on  January  18,  2007.  This  bill  was  originally  introduced  in  the  109th  Congress  as
H.R.  5658.  The  language  from  H.R.  5658  was  included  as  Section  17  of  H.R.  5656,
the  Energy  Research,  Development,  Demonstration  and  Commercial  Application  Act
of 2006, which was later passed by the House under suspension of the rules as H.R.
6203.

To date, H.R. 547 is expressly endorsed by the following organizations:

• National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS)
• Renewable Fuels Association (RFA)
• Society of Independent Gas Marketers of America (SIGMA)
• National Association of Truck Stop Owners (NATSO)
• Coalition of E–85 Retailers
• Petroleum Marketers Association of America (PMAA)

The hearing will seek to address the following questions related H.R. 547:

1. What infrastructure challenges currently hinder wide scale marketplace dis-

tribution of alternative fuels?

2. What  are  the  limitations  in  the  current  testing  equipment  and  protocols  for

verification of the sulfur content of diesel fuel?

Witnesses

• Mr.  John  Eichberger  is  the  Vice  President  of  the  National  Association  of
Convenience  Stores  (NACS)  and  will  also  testify  on  behalf  of  the  Society  of
Independent Gasoline Marketers of America (SIGMA).

• Mr. Bob Dinneen is the President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Associa-
tion,  the  trade  association  for  the  U.S.  ethanol  industry  and  advocate  for  the
increased production and use of fuel ethanol.

• Mr. Richard Kassel is  the  Senior  Attorney  and  Director  of  the  Clean  Fuels

Background
Alternative Fuels and Infrastructure

4

Rising  oil  prices  and  concern  about  our  nation’s  dependence  upon  foreign  fuel
sources have increased interest in diversifying our fuel supply through the develop-
ment of alternative, domestic sources of fuel.

The  development  and  production  of  alternative  bio-based  fuels  is  increasing  and
there is great interest in expanding the use of these fuels. There are approximately
101  ethanol  refineries  online  today,  with  many  more  in  various  stages  of  planning.
However,  due  largely  to  ethanol’s  hydrophilic  properties,  ethanol  is  not  compatible
with  the  existing  distribution  pipeline  infrastructure.  Therefore  it  must  be  trans-
ported by tanker truck and rail, making long-distance shipping extremely expensive.
According  to  the  National  Ethanol  Vehicle  Coalition  there  are  already  approxi-
mately six million E–85-compatible Fuel Flexible Vehicles (FFV) on American roads,
with auto manufacturers adding several new FFV models to their product lines. The
Department  of  Energy  counts  over  900  stations  to  date  selling  E–85,  concentrated
primarily  in  the  Upper  Midwest.  While  the  number  of  stations  is  expanding,  it  is
still  less  than  one  percent  of  the  approximately  167,000  retail  fuel  outlets  in  the
U.S.  For  example,  despite  being  the  Nation’s  largest  auto  market,  California  cur-
rently has one public E–85 station. The lack of service stations selling E–85 means
that  in  the  near-term  a  very  small  proportion  of  compatible  vehicles  will  actually
utilize E–85.

Ethanol  is  currently  blended  with  approximately  40  percent  of  the  Nation’s  fuel
supply, mostly at concentrations of approximately 10 percent of the fuel by volume.
It  is  at  higher  concentrations  of  ethanol,  such  as  in  E–85,  where  technical  issues
arise. Alternative fuels like E–85 and biodiesel have different physical and chemical
properties  that  make  them  incompatible  with  existing  transportation,  distribution,
and  retail  infrastructure.  These  fuels  may  be  associated  with  a  variety  of  technical
issues relating to corrosion of tank and pipeline materials, increased sediment build-
up,  filter  clogging,  electrical  conductivity,  water  and  microbial  contamination,  vary-
ing  flow  rates,  and  thermal  and  oxidative  instability.  Unfortunately,  even  with  fed-
eral assistance grants, the cost of replacing or building new infrastructure is simply
not  feasible  for  many  fuel  retailers  and  distributors,  most  of  whom  are  small  busi-
nesses.

Evidence  suggests  that  it  may  be  possible  to  develop  additives  and  blendstocks
that  would  avoid  the  need  for  expensive  modification  and  replacement  of  existing
infrastructure.  It  may  also  be  possible  to  develop  safer  and  less  destructive  infra-
structure  refurbishment  methods  and  technologies.  H.R.  547  directs  the  Secretary
of Energy, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology
to  develop  additives,  blendstocks,  technologies  and  methods  to  address  these  con-
cerns.
Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD)

In 2000 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) instituted a program to
lower the emissions of diesel fuels by approximately 95 percent. Federal regulations
mandated  that  after  an  initial  phase-in  period,  beginning  June  1,  2006,  all  diesel
fuel  refined  and  sold  in  the  U.S.  must  be  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel  (ULSD).  ULSD
is diesel fuel containing less than 15 parts per million (ppm) of sulfur.

Prior to this time retailers sold Low Sulfur Diesel (LSD) containing up to 500 ppm
of  sulfur.  The  reduction  in  the  sulfur  content  of  diesel  fuel  served  to  mitigate  the
acid  rain-causing  effects  of  sulfur  compounds  and  also  allowed  for  the  introduction
in  2007  of  advanced  diesel  engine  technologies  that  would  otherwise  foul  with  high
concentrations of sulfur. These new engine technologies reduce the emissions of par-
ticulate matter and nitrogen oxides, or NOΧ, which exacerbate respiratory ailments
and  react  with  oxygen  to  produce  ozone.  This  allows  for  the  introduction  of  a  wide
range of clean diesel trucks and passenger vehicles into the U.S. market.

ULSD  introduction  also  presented  some  challenges  at  various  points  of  the  dis-
tribution  chain.  As  ULSD  moves  from  the  refinery  through  the  pipelines,  tanks,
trucks  and  related  infrastructure  it  can  absorb  residual  sulfur  left  by  other,  high-
sulfur fuel products. Products such as Low Sulfur Diesel with up to 500 ppm sulfur,
Jet Fuel with 3,000 ppm, and even Heating Oil with up to 5,000 ppm may be moved
through  the  same  infrastructure  as  ULSD.  The  fuel  industry  feared  that  this  con-
tamination  would  result  in  diesel  fuel  arriving  at  fueling  stations  with  sulfur  con-
tents  that  exceeded  15  ppm,  thus  exposing  ‘‘downstream’’  retailers  and  distributors
to  liability  for  sale  of  non-compliant  fuels.  Current  protocols  and  equipment  for
verifying  the  sulfur  content  of  fuel  are  expensive  and  inaccessible  to  fuel  retailers
and  others  along  the  distribution  chain.  While  the  transition  to  ULSD  has  gone
smoothly  by  most  all  accounts,  the  development  of  less  expensive  and  more  robust

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

testing methods would enable more frequent testing of fuel sulfur content to assure
that  regulated  limits  are  not  exceeded  and  to  quickly  identify  any  contamination
problems that may occur along the distribution chain.

The need for advances in testing equipment is not limited to ULSD. Evolution in
sulfur analysis technologies may lead to advances in testing for other fuel contami-
nants. For instance, current standards for biodiesel (ASTM standard D6751) lay out
the critical specifications and set limits for manufacturers on maximum allowed con-
centrations  for  various  contaminants,  including  sulfur.  The  biodiesel  industry  is
pushing  for  strict  adherence  to  these  specifications.  Because  of  the  low  concentra-
tions and narrow tolerances needed to meet these standards, the measurements are
difficult  to  perform  accurately,  especially  in  the  smaller  production  facilities  that
tend to characterize the biofuels industry.

Further steps that can be taken to improve measurement accuracy for diesel fuels
involve  working  with  analytical  instrument  manufacturers  and  commercial  sup-
pliers  of  calibration  materials  to  transfer  the  inherent  accuracy  of  Standard  Ref-
erence Materials developed by NIST to working calibration standards used for field
testing  instrumentation.  Section  4  of  H.R.  547  directs  DOE  and  NIST  to  develop
these  portable,  low  cost,  and  accurate  technologies  for  testing  sulfur  content  of  die-
sel fuels, and begin demonstrations of such technologies within one year.
Standard Reference Materials (SRMs)

NIST prepares SRMs for three main purposes: (1) to help develop accurate meth-
ods of analysis; (2) to calibrate measurement systems used to facilitate exchange of
goods,  institute  quality  control,  determine  performance  characteristics,  or  measure
a  property  at  the  state-of-the-art  limit;  and  (3)  to  ensure  the  long-term  adequacy
and integrity of measurement quality assurance programs.

Industry,  academia,  and  government  use  NIST  SRMs  to  facilitate  commerce  and
trade  and  to  advance  research  and  development.  For  example,  State  governments
use SRMs for fuels to certify station pumps and other dispensing equipment.

Market  acceptance  of  any  fuel  requires  a  reliable  supply  of  the  fuel  that  consist-
ently  meets  certain  specifications  needed  to  ensure  quality  and  compatibility  with
engines and infrastructure. Section 5 of H.R. 547 directs NIST to compile a database
of  physical  properties  for  alternative  fuels,  and  use  these  data  to  develop  Standard
Reference Materials (SRMs) such as those NIST develops for conventional fuels.

Section-by-Section Description of H.R. 547
Section 1. Short Title

The Advanced Fuels Research and Development Act

Section 2. Findings

The Nation should have a diverse fuel supply which includes alternative fuels, but
incompatibility  of  some  fuels  with  existing  infrastructure  presents  significant  and
costly barriers to market penetration. Fuel additives or other technologies may allow
such  alternative  fuels  to  be  distributed  and  dispensed  in  existing  infrastructure.
Fuel  retailers  and  distributors  do  not  have  ready  access  to  technologies  that  verify
fuels are in compliance with federal regulations for diesel fuels.
Section  3. Alternative  Fuel  and  ULSD  Infrastructure  and  Additives  Re-

search and Development.

Directs the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards
and  Technology  (NIST)  to  conduct  research  and  development,  demonstration  and
commercial application of additives for bio-based alternative fuels (and ULSD) to ad-
dress  infrastructure  compatibility  issues  such  as:  corrosion  of  infrastructure  mate-
rials,  dislodging  of  storage  tank  sediment,  water  and  microbial  contamination,  in-
creased  emissions,  temperature-sensitivity.  The  program  should  also  investigate
various  methods  for  infrastructure  refurbishment  and  cleaning,  and  other  infra-
structure-related problems as identified by DOE and NIST.
Section 4. Sulfur Testing for Diesel Fuels

Directs the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards
and  Technology  (NIST)  to  conduct  research,  development,  demonstration  and  com-
mercial application of portable, low cost, and accurate technologies for testing sulfur
content  of  diesel  fuels,  and  begin  demonstrations  of  such  technologies  within  one
year.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Good  afternoon.  This  is  the  first  hearing  of

the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment.

I  would  like  to  take  the  opportunity  to  welcome  all  our  new
Members.  Representative  Inglis,  I  look  forward  to  working  with
you  over  the  next  two  years,  and  I  will  call  this  meeting  to  order,
and tell you that our hearing this afternoon is on H.R. 547, the Ad-
vanced  Fuel  Infrastructure  Research  and  Development  Act,  intro-
duced by Chairman Gordon.

Energy  is  on  everyone’s  mind  these  days.  The  price  of  fuels  has
been  rising,  and  awareness  of  the  extent  to  which  we  are  depend-
ent upon foreign sources of oil has grown. At the same time, in an
effort to reduce emissions of air pollution, we are also transitioning
to cleaner burning fuels. The good news is that we have developed
and  are  continuing  to  develop  alternative  fuels,  and  cleaner  burn-
ing  versions  of  our  current  petroleum-based  fuels.  But  it  is  not
enough simply to develop these new alternatives. We also must en-
sure  the  availability  of  infrastructure  and  equipment  for  trans-
porting,  distributing,  and  utilizing  these  new  fuels  at  a  reasonable
cost.

And  that  is  where  H.R.  547  comes  in.  This  bill  authorizes  re-
search  programs  to  address  two  specific  issues.  The  first  will  seek
cost-effective methods for making our current fuel distribution sys-
tem compatible with biofuels. The second will initiate a program to
develop  less  expensive,  easier  to  use  testing  methods  and  equip-
ment  for  verifying  the  sulfur  level  of  fuels.  I  understand  from  re-
cent  reports  that  transition  to  new  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel  fuel
mandated  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  is  going  well.
I  believe  several  of  our  witnesses  will  speak  to  that,  to  that  effort
briefly this afternoon.

And I look forward to hearing the views of our panel of witnesses
on  H.R.  547,  and  I  thank  all  of  you  for  participating  today.  And
now, I will yield my remaining time to the author of this—is he not
here yet? Okay.

Let  us—I  will  hold  on  to  that,  and  at  this  time,  I  would  like  to
recognize  our  distinguished  Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Inglis,  of  South
Carolina, for his opening statement.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good afternoon.
This  is  the  first  hearing  of  the  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Environment.  I
would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  welcome  all  of  our  Members.  Rep.  Inglis,  I
look forward to working with you over the next two years.

Our hearing this afternoon is on H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Re-

search and Development Act, introduced by Chairman Gordon.

Energy  is  on  everyone’s  mind  these  days.  The  price  of  fuels  has  been  rising  and
awareness  of  the  extent  to  which  we  are  dependent  upon  foreign  sources  of  oil  has
grown.  At  the  same  time,  in  an  effort  to  reduce  emissions  of  air  pollution  we  are
also transitioning to cleaner burning fuels.

The  good  news  is  that  we  have  developed  and  are  continuing  to  develop  alter-
native fuels and cleaner burning versions of our current petroleum-based fuels. But
it is not enough simply to develop these new alternatives. We also must ensure the
availability  of  infrastructure  and  equipment  for  transporting,  distributing,  and  uti-
lizing these new fuels at a reasonable cost.

That  is  where  H.R.  547  comes  in.  This  bill  authorizes  research  programs  to  ad-
dress  two  specific  issues.  The  first  will  seek  cost-effective  methods  for  making  our
current  fuel  distribution  system  compatible  with  biofuels.  The  second  will  initiate

a  program  to  develop  less  expensive,  easier  to  use  testing  methods  and  equipment
for verifying the sulfur level of fuels.

I  understand  from  recent  reports,  that  transition  to  new  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel
fuel  mandated  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  is  going  well.  I  be-
lieve several of our witnesses will speak to that effort briefly this afternoon.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  views  of  our  panel  of  witnesses  on  H.R.  547,  and

I thank all of you for participating today.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Chairman  Lampson,  and  thank  you  to

the witnesses for appearing.

Now, since this is my first time to speak as the Ranking Member
of  the  Energy  Subcommittee,  I  would  say  this.  I  am  very  grateful
for  the  opportunity  to  be  at  this  subcommittee.  There  are  other
people,  including,  I  see  down  here,  Mr.  Bartlett,  who  probably
could  do  an  even  better  job  as  the  Ranking  Member,  and  then,  we
have got Vernon Ehlers, and some other people. That hasn’t caused
me  to  want  to  give  up  the  slot,  however,  I  would  point  out,  but  in
any event, I am grateful for the opportunity to be here, and Chair-
man Lampson, I would say to you that this is a remarkable oppor-
tunity we have, I think, as Republicans and Democrats, to work to-
gether to accomplish good things for the country.

The  President  says  he  is  for  alternative  energy.  He  called  on  us
to  take  action  in  the  State  of  the  Union.  Democrats  are  clearly  for
alternative  energy.  A  good  number  of  Republicans  are  concerned
about  this,  and  so,  there  is  no  reason  not  to  take  action,  and  so,
I  am  very  excited  about  serving  with  you,  and  I  think  that  the
other  Members  of—on  our  side  of  the  panel  are  also  vitally  inter-
ested  in  this  topic.  It  is—we  have  opportunities  in  alternative  en-
ergy  to  win  the  triple  play,  to  create  jobs  with  new  technologies,
to clean the air, and then, third, and maybe of more—most general
application  for  everybody  in  the  country,  to  improve  the  national
security of the United States.

So,  it  really  is  the  triple  play  opportunity  for  us,  in  this  Con-
gress, and so, I am excited about that, and hope that we can work
together  to  move  ideas  forward  that  will  help  advance  this  cause,
of breaking our addiction to oil, and finding new sources of energy.
And  this  bill  before  us  certainly  fits  that  bill,  and  so,  I  am  very
happy that we are having this hearing, and I join in support of this
bill  put  forward  by  the  Chairman,  and  there  are  some  interesting
questions  for  our  panelists  today,  and  I  look  forward  to  those,  and
I  look  forward  to  working  with  you  in  making  this  a  very  produc-
tive Congress.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Inglis follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chair,  for  your  remarks.  I  am  excited  to  be  working  with  you  as
we  seek  to  tackle  the  energy  and  environmental  challenges  in  the  first  Energy  and
Environment Subcommittee hearing of the 110th Congress.

I am pleased to see the Subcommittee addressing this legislation early in the Con-
gress.  The  promise  of  fuels  of  the  future  to  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil  is
one  that  both  Republicans  and  Democrats  support.  Americans  don’t  care  which
party gets the credit; they want to see solutions.

I  am  also  excited  about  the  possibilities  to  improve  our  energy  security,  create
jobs by retooling the car, and clean the air through a hydrogen economy. The scope
of  the  challenge  requires  many  solutions.  America  will  benefit  from  the  successes
of  its  inventors,  scientists  and  engineers.  The  government  can  help  by  harnessing
the  energy  of  its  citizens  through  funding  basic  research.  During  my  tenure  on  the
Budget  Committee  (’93–’98),  I  learned  the  difference  between  simple  spending  and
thoughtful  investing.  Investing  in  the  research  and  development  of  fuels  of  the  fu-

ture makes sense. If we invest wisely, we can find economic growth through innova-
tion.

We  can  reap  the  benefits  of  biodiesel  made  from  renewable  agricultural  products
instead  of  buying  it  from  foreign  oil  companies  in  unstable  countries—and  produce
less pollution.

A  Department  of  Energy  study  showed  that  the  production  and  use  of  biodiesel,
compared to petroleum diesel, resulted in a 78.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions. For every unit of energy needed to produce a gallon of biodiesel, we gain
3.24 units of energy, giving it a positive energy balance.

I  understand  that  biodiesel  is  chemically  and  physically  different  than  petroleum
based  diesel.  These  differences  present  some  problems  of  compatibility  with  the  ex-
isting infrastructure. I hope that the witnesses today can help us better understand
this  challenge  and  how  H.R.  547  can  help  address  other  challenges  related  to  mov-
ing Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel through our existing infrastructure.

I  commend  the  Chairman  of  the  Science  Committee,  Mr.  Gordon,  for  introducing
this  bill  and  taking  quick  steps  to  further  its  passage.  H.R.  547  is  an  example  of
a clear step that will both improve energy security and help clean the air.

Democrats are for alternative energy; Republicans are for alternative energy. Con-
gress is ready; the President is ready. So let’s hear from the witnesses how we may
best begin.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Inglis.
I  totally  agree.  I  think  there  is  a  magnificent  opportunity  for  us
here,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  all  of  you,  and  there  are
some  awfully  bright  people  on  this  subcommittee,  so  I  hope  that
neither  of  us  is  intimidated  by  their  knowledge.  But  I  think  that
we will grow because of what they bring to this committee.

I  will,  at  this  time,  in  the  interest  of  time,  ask  unanimous  con-
sent  that  all  additional  opening  statements,  with  the  exception  of
Mr. Gordon when he comes, submitted by Subcommittee Members,
be included in the record.

Without objection, so ordered.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BART GORDON

Thank you Mr. Lampson.
I  am  happy  to  be  with  the  Subcommittee  today  to  discuss  my  bill  H.R.  547,  the

Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act.

I  appreciate  the  witnesses  providing  testimony  on  the  bill.  I  would  also  like  to
thank the many groups that are supporting this legislation. Your endorsements will
be included in the record.

When  I  took  the  reigns  of  this  committee  I  made  a  promise  that  this  would  be

a Committee of ‘‘Good Ideas’’ and ‘‘Consensus.’’ We are here to solve problems.

This  bill  is  a  prime  example  of  how  we  can  identify  problems  big  and  small,  and
leverage  the  resources  and  expertise  of  the  Committee  to  develop  creative  ways  to
bridge technological gaps through research and development.

It is clear that fueling our country solely on conventional fuels threatens our eco-
nomic  well-being  and  environmental  health.  The  public  wants  and  deserves  clean
and reliable fuel choices.

But,  if  this  country  is  serious  about  reducing  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  we
need  to  get  serious  about  mobilizing  the  infrastructure  necessary  to  distribute  and
dispense the newest generation of fuels.

For a number of reasons alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are often

incompatible with many components of the present-day infrastructure.

Fuel  distributors  and  retailers  are  left  to  bear  the  considerable  burden  and  cost
of  refurbishing,  replacing,  or  constructing  entirely  new  infrastructure  if  they  want
(or are ever required) to carry such fuels.

At  $30,000  to  $200,000  per  station,  a  nationwide  change  in  infrastructure  could

cost $5 to $30 billion.

Instead,  my  bill  instructs  the  Department  of  Energy  and  the  National  Institute
of  Standards  and  Technology  to  research  fuel  additives  and  other  technologies  that
could  mitigate  many  of  these  problems,  and  make  bio-based  fuels  more  compatible
with the country’s petroleum-based infrastructure.

In  addition,  the  bill  addresses  potential  challenges  as  suppliers  transition  to  sig-
nificantly  cleaner  fuels  by  instructing  DOE  and  NIST  to  develop  portable,  low-cost,
and accurate methods suppliers can use to test sulfur content in fuels.

Since infrastructure is used for various fuel products with sulfur content ranging
from 15 to 5000 ppm, there is a concern that distributors and retailers may sell fuel
with levels of sulfur beyond what is safe for the newest generation of highway diesel
engines.

It  should  be  noted  that  this  section  is  not  meant  to  interfere  with  the  role  of  the
Environmental Protection Agency in what has been a very successful market transi-
tion  to  Ultra  Low  Sulfur  Diesel.  It  simply  seeks  to  provide  easier  access  to  testing
and verification for all participants. I encourage DOE and NIST to coordinate these
activities with EPA.

I  hope  this  bill  also  illustrates  that  solving  problems  does  not  require  years  of
wrangling  over  major  omnibus  legislation  that  in  the  end  fails  to  meet  everyone’s
expectations.

Here  we  took  a  good  idea,  turned  it  into  a  good  bill,  and  with  the  support  of  our
Members  we  will  pass  it  out  of  Committee  tomorrow  and  send  it  to  the  Floor  next
week.

I look forward to hearing testimony. Thank you.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  It  is  my  pleasure  to  introduce  the  excellent
panel  of  witnesses  that  we  have  with  us  this  afternoon.  Mr.  John
Eichberger is the Vice President of the National Association of Con-
venience  Stores,  NACS.  This  afternoon,  he  is  also  testifying  on  be-
half  of  the  Society  of  Independent  Gasoline  Marketers  of  America.
Mr.  Richard  Kassel  is  the  Senior  Attorney  and  Director  of  the
Clean  Fuels  and  Vehicles  Project  at  the  National  Resources  De-
fense  Council;  and  Mr.  Bob  Dinneen  is  the  President  and  CEO  of
the  Renewable  Fuels  Association,  the  trade  association  rep-
resenting the U.S. ethanol industry.

I want to welcome each and every one of you. You will each have
five  minutes  for  your  spoken  testimony.  Your  written  testimony
will  be  included  in  the  record  if  you  choose  to  submit  anything  in
the record for the hearing.

And  when  all  three  of  you  have  completed  your  testimony,  we
will  begin  with  questions.  Each  Member  will  have  five  minutes  to
question the panel.

Mr. Eichberger, would you please begin.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  JOHN  EICHBERGER,  VICE  PRESIDENT,
GOVERNMENT  RELATIONS,  NATIONAL  ASSOCIATION  OF
CONVENIENCE STORES
Mr.  EICHBERGER.  Mr.  Chairman,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  Mem-
bers  of  the  Committee,  thank  you  very  much  for  inviting  me  here
to  testify.  My  name  is  John  Eichberger.  I  am  Vice  President,  Gov-
ernment  Relations,  for  the  National  Association  of  Convenience
Stores, also known as NACS.

On  behalf  of  the  convenience  and  petroleum  retailing  industry,
which sells approximately 80 percent of the motor fuels in the Na-
tion, I appear today in support of H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels In-
frastructure Research and Development Act.

This  legislation  comes  at  an  appropriate  time.  Today,  the  motor
fuels  industry  is  experiencing  a  significant  transition  to  the  next
generation of fuels, and as Congress contemplates policies to accel-
erate  this  transition,  H.R.  547  represents  a  welcome  effort  to  ad-
dress two of the many challenges facing the retailers.

With  regards  to  alternative  fuel,  let  me  be  clear.  Petroleum  re-
tailers don’t really care which fuels they sell, provided there is suf-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

11

ficient  supply  and  consumer  demand  for  those  products.  However,
converting  to  new  fuels  can  present  challenges  to  many  retailers.
For some, converting to a fuel like E–85 or B–100 can be relatively
simple.  If  they  are  fortunate,  all  of  the  equipment  at  their  facility
is  already  certified  as  compatible  with  these  fuels.  And  all  they
need to do is simply make sure—begin the transition to those new
fuels.

Other  retailers,  however,  are  not  as  fortunate.  Much  of  the
equipment  commonly  found  at  a  retail  location  is  not  certified  for
use  with  these  fuels,  typically  because  of  concerns  with  corrosion
and  material  degradation.  Such  equipment  must  be  replaced,  and
in  some  cases,  at  significant  cost.  Sample  invoices  on  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy’s  website  range  from  about  $17,000  to  $60,000  per
location. But NACS’ members inform us that if they had to replace
the  entire  tank  system,  costs  can  be  significantly  higher.  To  put
this in perspective, in 2005, the convenience stores reported an av-
erage pretax profit of only $42,000 per location.

Compounding  this  issue  is  the  fact  that  Underwriters  Labora-
tories  last  fall  suspended  certification  for  all  dispensers  to  sell  E–
85,  due  to  concerns  about  corrosion.  While  many  E–85  retailers
continue to operate under agreements with local officials, this does
not  absolve  them  from  any  potential  liability  associated  with  a  re-
lease  from  one  of  these  non-certified  dispensers.  Until  UL  decides
to  certify  dispensers  for  E–85  sales,  the  number  of  retailers  inter-
ested in converting to E–85 will be greatly diminished.

Clearly, equipment compatibility is a serious issue. The research
in  H.R.  547,  if  successful,  will  hopefully  address  these  challenges
in a more cost-effective way, and mitigate the significant barrier to
entry. But I must caution this committee and the Congress that re-
solving  the  issue  of  incompatibility  alone  will  not  result  in  auto-
matic  widespread  availability  of  alternative  fuels.  Retailers  must
assess the impact of alternate fuel on their overall business model.
For  example,  is  there  sufficient  demand  to  justify  replacing  a
gasoline or diesel fuel dispenser with an alternative fuel? Does the
retailer  have  a  tank  available  to  convert  to  alternative  fuel,  or  the
physical  space  to  install  an  additional  tank?  Are  supplies  in  the
market  sufficient  to  enable  the  alternative  fuel  to  compete  for
price-sensitive customers with gasoline? And most importantly, will
switching to an alternative fuel increase or decrease customer traf-
fic inside the store, where the retailer makes most of their money?
Mr.  Chairman,  these  are  real  issues.  Yes,  H.R.  547  could  sub-
stantially  improve  the  economic  calculations  for  retailers,  but  in-
stallation decisions will be based upon a balancing of various mar-
ket  forces  involved,  and  Congress  should  be  sensitive  to  these
issues.

With  regards  to  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel,  NACS  strongly  sup-
ports research to develop an accurate and affordable sulfur test. So
far,  the  transition  to  ULSD  has  gone  relatively  smoothly,  much
more  so  than  anybody  could  have  anticipated.  However,  consistent
compliance is critical. Drivers must be able to rely upon the integ-
rity  of  ULSD,  and  retailers  face  fines  up  to  $32,500  if  they  are
found  to  violate  the  15  parts  per  million  sulfur  standard.  If  a  re-
tailer  is  found  violating  15  ppm,  the  regulations  provide  them  a
three part defense. One, they must demonstrate that the ULSD de-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

12

livered to their location was certified by their distributor as compli-
ant.  They  must  demonstrate  that  the  contamination  was  not
caused  by  their  actions.  And  third,  they  must  demonstrate  that
they have implemented a credible quality assurance program to en-
sure continued compliance.

This  third  defense  is  the  primary  challenge.  The  only  way  to
completely  ensure  continued  compliance  is  to  test  every  batch.
However,  there  is  no  accurate,  prompt—no  accurate  way  to  meas-
ure  sulfur  and  get  prompt  results.  Right  now,  you  have  to  take  a
sample, send it to a lab, and wait 48 hours for a response. It is im-
practical  to  hold  a  load  of  diesel  aside  until  those  results  come
back.  Therefore,  currently,  quality  assurance  programs  are  based
upon a specific process of inventory management supported by evi-
dentiary  testing  results.  They  figure  out  what  they  need  to  do  to
manage  inventory,  and  test  early  on  to  see  if  it  is  working,  then
they continue that process throughout the system.

While  this  is  a  defensible  method  to  ensure  compliance,  it  is  not
perfect. H.R. 547 seeks to develop an accurate and affordable sulfur
test.  If  successful,  retailers  and  others  throughout  the  distribution
system  will  be  able  to  conduct  quality  assurance  tests  more  fre-
quently,  thereby  increasing  the  confidence  of  their  customers  that
all ULSD meets the sulfur level, the 15 parts per million.

Mr.  Chairman,  these  conclude  my  remarks,  and  I  look  forward

to your questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Eichberger follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN EICHBERGER

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Inglis, and Members of the Committee. My name
is  John  Eichberger  and  I  am  Vice  President  of  Government  Relations  for  the  Na-
tional Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).

NACS is an international trade association comprised of 2,200 retail member com-
panies  representing  an  industry  with  more  than  140,000  retail  locations.  In  2005,
the  convenience  and  petroleum  retailing  industry  employed  more  than  1.5  million
workers  and  sold  nearly  80  percent  of  the  motor  fuels  consumed  in  the  United
States.

The  motor  fuels  industry  is  currently  experiencing  a  significant  transition  to  the
next  generation  of  fuels.  As  Congress  contemplates  policies  to  promote  this  transi-
tion, it must also understand that there are many complicated challenges facing re-
tailers and the distributors that serve them that must be overcome before the mar-
ket can efficiently offer these new fuels to consumers.

H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act, initi-
ates federal research and development projects to help the petroleum industry over-
come  some  of  these  hurdles  in  the  most  cost  efficient  manner,  thereby  facilitating
the smooth transition to these the new fuels. NACS supports the goals of this legis-
lation and, today, I would like to comment on the two primary provisions independ-
ently.
Alternative Fuels

Clearly, the political momentum to bring alternative fuels to market is strong and
growing. I cannot stress enough that petroleum retailers are agnostic regarding the
type of fuels they sell, provided there is sufficient supply and consumer demand for
those  products.  As  supply  and  demand  increase  for  alternative  fuels  via  market
forces  and  government  programs,  however,  there  remain  significant  hurdles  inhib-
iting  their  smooth  introduction  to  market.  H.R.  547  seeks  to  address  one  of  these
challenges—the  incompatibility  of  certain  fuels  with  existing  storage  and  distribu-
tion infrastructure.
Compatibility Issues

This issue of incompatibility carries with it potentially high costs to retailers seek-
ing  to  convert  their  facilities  to  dispense  these  alternative  fuels.  A  retailer  must  be

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

13

able to determine precisely what equipment is involved in his system and for which
fuels that equipment is certified.

Some  reports  have  indicated  that  certain  components  commonly  found  in  storage
and dispensing infrastructure may be incompatible with fuels like E–85 and B–100.
These may include components made with aluminum, brass, copper and zinc or con-
taining  various  elastomers,  thermoplastics,  thermosets,  ceramics,  pipe  dope  and  or-
ganic  coatings.  Such  metal  components  could  be  vulnerable  to  corrosion  when  in
consistent contact with these fuels, while non-metal components could be subject to
swelling, degradation, softening, embrittlement and delamination.1

However,  there  remains  a  considerable  amount  of  uncertainty  regarding  the  ex-
tent  to  which  these  materials  may  be  vulnerable  and  retailers  cannot  make  broad
assumptions regarding the compatibility of their equipment.

In  an  effort  to  address  the  confusion  that  exists  with  regard  to  compatibility,  the
Petroleum Equipment Institute has provided on its web site a list of equipment cer-
tified  by  the  manufacturer  and  listed  by  a  laboratory  for  compatibility  with  certain
fuel  types.2 Retailers  must  work  with  their  equipment  suppliers  to  determine  spe-
cifically what equipment must be replaced and what is already compatible with the
fuel  they  are  considering.  In  some  cases,  retailers  may  find  it  necessary  to  replace
their entire system at significant expense.

Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) is the definitive resource to certify equipment
as  compatible.  On  October  5,  2006,  UL  suspended  certification  of  all  dispensers  for
compatibility with fuels containing greater than 15 percent alcohol. UL cited as the
reason for this suspension: ‘‘Research indicates that the presence of high concentra-
tions  of  ethanol  or  other  alcohols  within  blended  fuels  makes  these  fuels  signifi-
cantly  more  corrosive.  This  may  result  in  the  fuel  chemically  degrading  the  mate-
rials  used  in  fuel-dispenser  components,  and  may  ultimately  affect  the  dispenser’s
ability to contain the fuel.’’

As  of  this  month,  despite  the  assistance  of  a  technical  conference  and  receipt  of
various  supporting  documents,  UL  has  been  unable  to  resolve  its  concerns  and  is
preparing to conduct its own round of testing later this year.3

This  is  an  important  issue  for  retailers.  Most  jurisdictions  require  equipment  to
be  UL  certified  before  a  retailer  can  put  it  into  operation.  Given  the  current  state
of non-approval by UL, many retailers who have already installed E–85 fueling sys-
tems continue to operate under agreements with local officials. While this may sat-
isfy  local  operating  requirements,  it  does  not  absolve  retailers  of  potential  liability
associated  with  a  petroleum  or  alternative  fuels  release  caused  by  one  of  these  dis-
pensers.  Therefore,  the  continued  deliberations  at  Underwriters  Laboratories  and
the rapid resolution of this issue is of critical importance to retailers.

Clearly,  compatibility  between  alternative  fuels  and  existing  infrastructure  is  a

serious issue that can cost retailers thousands of dollars.

The Department of Energy has posted on its web site invoices for the installation
of  E–85  compatible  equipment.  Some  of  the  prices  quoted  on  that  site  are  $35,274,
$15,383, $57,922, $27,321, and $24,105. These costs are significant, especially when
one  considers  that  the  average  pre-tax  profit  for  a  convenience  store  in  2005  was
only $42,000.4

This  is  one  of  the  primary  reasons  the  petroleum  retail  industry  is  slow  to  adopt
these  alternative  fuels.  The  legislation  under  consideration  today,  however,  if  suc-
cessful, will hopefully address the equipment compatibility challenges in a more cost
efficient  way  and  mitigate  this  significant  barrier  to  entry.  For  that  reason,  NACS
supports this part of the legislation.
Other Hurdles to Installation

However, I must caution this Committee, and the entire Congress, that the issue
of incompatibility is only one of the hurdles that impede an individual retailer’s de-
cision  to  install  E–85.  Consequently,  resolving  that  issue  alone  will  not  automati-
cally  result  in  widespread  availability.  While  other  Congressional  Committees  will
determine federal policy and government programs regarding alternative fuel avail-
ability, I would like share with you the other considerations facing retailers because
I  believe  it  is  pertinent  to  Congress’  broad  consideration  of  the  alternative  fuels
issue.

First,  while  I  will  acknowledge  that  the  auto  manufacturers  are  increasing  their
production  of  flexible  fuel  vehicles  equipped  to  run  on  E–85,  the  number  of  these
vehicles  currently  on  the  road  remains  relatively  small  and  the  number  of  drivers
who  know  their  vehicles  are  specially  equipped  is  even  smaller.  This  means  a  re-
tailer must carefully evaluate the level of demand for E–85 in his operating market
to  determine  if  it  makes  business  sense  to  dedicate  a  dispenser  to  sell  the  product.
The  typical  convenience  store  operates  four  multi-pump  dispensers,  each  providing
two fueling positions. If E–85 is sold from one of these dispensers, gasoline customer
throughput  capacity  is  reduced  by  25  percent  due  to  the  reduction  in  fueling  posi-
tions.  Unless  there  is  strong  demand  for  E–85,  this  could  substantially  affect  the
retailer’s overall business model.

Secondly, not every retail location can accommodate an E–85 storage tank. Many
facilities maintain only two underground storage tanks—one for premium unleaded
and one for regular unleaded. Mid-grade often is produced by mixing the two at the
dispenser. To install E–85, the retailer must either install a third tank, which may
not  be  physically  possible  depending  upon  the  size  of  the  facility,  or  replace  one  of
these two gasoline tanks. Clearly, this is not a viable option.

Retailers with additional tanks, perhaps containing diesel fuel, must make a deci-
sion  to  replace  that  product  with  the  alternative  fuel.  Again,  this  is  a  decision  that
will have direct implications for the company’s business model.

Third,  retailers  must  be  cognizant  of  the  price  sensitivity  of  the  consumer.  The
retail gasoline marketplace is the most competitive in the Nation—large price signs
on the corner empower consumers to shop by price without ever leaving their vehi-
cles. And they do.

According  to  consumer  polling  just  completed  this  month,  NACS  found  that  two-
thirds  of  consumers  shop  by  price  and  more  than  one  in  four  will  go  out  of  their
way—such  as  turn  left  across  a  busy  intersection—to  save  one  penny  per  gallon.
Given  the  fact  that  E–85  provides  the  consumers  with  approximately  25  percent
fewer  miles  per  gallon,  a  retailer  must  be  able  to  sell  it  at  a  substantial  discount
compared  to  gasoline  in  order  to  satisfy  the  consumers’  economic  interest.  NACS
members  who  do  offer  E–85  report  that  when  the  alternative  fuel  is  priced  similar
to  gasoline  they  experience  a  significant  drop  in  gallons  sold.  Therefore,  retailers
must assess the availability of E–85 in their market and the variable price relation-
ship of that product to gasoline. Often, there is a favorable price differential because
of  government  incentive  programs,  but  sometimes  there  is  not.  This  issue  must  be
taken into consideration.

My final point on alternative fuels is to applaud Congress for its interest in assist-
ing retailers to overcome the hurdles presented by these new fuels, but to make sure
that Congress understands the complexities of the issue. Section 3 of H.R. 547 could
substantially  improve  the  economic  calculations  for  retailers,  but  installation  deci-
sions will be based upon a balancing of the various market factors involved.
Diesel Sulfur

With regards to Section 4, ‘‘Sulfur Testing for Diesel Fuels,’’ NACS again supports
the research program to develop an affordable and reliable testing method to ensure
compliance with federal regulations.

In December 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated rules
requiring a 97 percent reduction in the sulfur content of on-road diesel fuel. Phase-
in of that program began in June 2006 and, effective October 15, 2006, any retailer
claiming to sell Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel, or ULSD, must ensure that its sulfur level
does  not  exceed  15  parts  per  million.  The  engine  manufacturers  report  that  sulfur
levels above that limit could damage emissions and engine technology of model year
2007  and  later  vehicles.  If  inspectors  find  that  the  USLD  does  in  fact  exceed  this
sulfur  limitation,  a  retailer  can  be  subject  to  fines  up  to  $32,500  per  violation,  as
established by the Clean Air Act.

If  found  in  violation  of  the  sulfur  limitation,  the  regulations  provide  the  retailer
with a three-part defense. First, a retailer must demonstrate through product trans-
fer  documents  that  all  ULSD  delivered  to  the  facility  was  certified  as  compliant  by
the  distributor.  Second,  a  retailer  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  that  contamination
of  the  product  was  not  caused  by  the  retailer.  And  third,  a  retailer  must  have  its
own credible quality assurance program designed to ensure compliance with the sul-
fur limitation.

This  third  defense  is  the  primary  challenge.  The  only  way  to  completely  ensure
continued  compliance  is  to  test  every  batch.  Unfortunately,  testing  must  be  con-
ducted  in  a  laboratory,  is  expensive  and  may  take  48  hours  to  return  results.  Con-
sequently,  it  is  not  practical  for  a  retailer  to  hold  a  load  of  ULSD  aside  until  con-
firmation of such test results. Therefore, retailers are left to design a quality assur-
ance program based upon a specific process of inventory management supported by

15

evidentiary  testing  results.  While  this  is  a  defensible  method  to  ensure  quality,  it
is not perfect.

NACS has been concerned for many years that there exists no reliable, affordable
sulfur test for retailers to use on a more frequent basis to ensure regulatory compli-
ance.  H.R.  547  seeks  to  develop  such  a  test.  If  successful,  retailers  and  others
throughout  the  distribution  system  will  have  the  ability  to  conduct  quality  assur-
ance tests more frequently, thereby increasing the confidence of their customers that
the product sold as ULSD does indeed meet the sulfur limit of 15 parts per million.
Conclusion

Mr.  Chairman,  these  conclude  my  remarks.  On  behalf  of  the  member  companies
of  NACS,  I  thank  you  for  your  efforts  to  address  these  specific  retailer  challenges
and  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  share  our  views  on  this  legislation.  I  would  be
happy to answer any questions my testimony may have raised.

will go to Mr. Kassel.
STATEMENT  OF  MR.  RICHARD  KASSEL,  SENIOR  ATTORNEY
AND  DIRECTOR  OF  THE  CLEAN  FUELS  AND  VEHICLES
PROJECT, NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL
Mr. KASSEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Inglis,
and  Members  of  the  Committee.  My  name  is  Richard  Kassel,  and
I am very pleased to testify today on H.R. 547.

I  am  a  Senior  Attorney  at  the  Natural  Resources  Defense  Coun-
cil,  where  I  direct  our  Clean  Fuels  and  Vehicles  Project.  I  also  ad-
vise  EPA,  as  a  member  of  its  Clean  Air  Act  Advisory  Committee
and its Mobile Sources Technical Review Subcommittee, so I am fa-
miliar with all the issues that are at hand here.

NRDC  is  a  national  nonprofit  environmental  organization.  We
represent  more  than  1.2  million  members  and  online  activists  na-
tionwide.  It  is  no  secret  our  continuing  reliance  on  gasoline  and
diesel  for  our  transportation  needs  contributes  to  a  wide  range  of
important  environmental  and  energy  concerns,  including  air  pollu-
tion, a wide range of public health impacts, oil dependency, and of
course, global warming.

H.R.  547  can  help  improve  the  transition  to  two  groups  of  fuels
that  can  help  in  all  these,  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel,  or  ULSD,  and
biofuels.  I  am  going  to  first  address  the  ULSD  issue,  and  that  is
where  I  will  spend  most  of  my  time.  Diesel  pollution  is,  of  course,
a  serious  problem  that  affects  all  Americans,  but  luckily,  it  is  a
solvable  problem.  And  thanks  to  EPA’s  groundbreaking  Highway
Diesel  Rule,  and  its  upcoming  Nonroad  Diesel  Rule,  we  actually

16

have  the  regulatory  structure  in  place  now  to  solve  the  problem.
And  over  time,  as  today’s  diesels  are  replaced  by  the  new  engines
that  meet  these  standards,  more  than  20,000  premature  deaths
will  be  eliminated  every  year  nationwide,  more  than  $140  billion
in annual health costs as well.

ULSD  fuel  is  the  key  to  achieving  these  pollution  benefits.  Just
as—there is an analogy here. Just as it was critical to remove lead
from gasoline to get cleaner cars two decades ago, it is now critical
to remove sulfur from diesel fuel to get cleaner trucks, buses, farm
equipment, industrial equipment, and so on today.

Now,  H.R.  547  is  going  to  help  improve  the  transition  to  ULSD.
To  paraphrase  Mr.  Gordon’s  written  comments  that  were  in  the
back of the room, it is a good idea, worthy of consensus.

But it is important also to note that the transition is, as already
has  been  mentioned,  going  smoothly.  Just  this  month,  EPA  re-
ported  that  90  percent  or  more  of  the  ULSD  in  the  system  is  al-
ready Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel. That is why engine makers and car
manufacturers  are  jumping  over  each  other  to  announce  their  new
product offerings that will meet the new pollution standards. They
wouldn’t  do  this  if  they  thought  that  fuel  availability  would  be  a
serious issue that would last.

Of  course,  that  doesn’t  mean  that  there  are  no  bumps  whatso-
ever.  Over  the  past  few  years,  many  stakeholders  raised  concerns
about  possible  sulfur  contamination  in  the  pipeline  system.  EPA
listened  to  those  concerns,  and  in  response,  last  year,  for  example,
raised  the  sulfur  tolerance  limits  to  give  industry  a  little  bit  more
breathing room during this transition phase. It was a good step.

Here  is  what  appears  to  be  happening  now.  Because  of  concerns
about  mis-fueling  at  the  retail  level,  service  stations  are  not  put-
ting  the  appropriate  ULSD  label  on  the  pumps.  And  indeed,  EPA
reported last week that 76 percent of the pumps they surveyed did
not have ULSD labels. But we know from the same report that 90
percent  of  the  fuel  is,  in  fact,  ULSD.  So,  there  is  no  availability
issue, but there is clearly a labeling issue. It is a serious issue, and
it needs to be addressed, and addressed swiftly.

Now, that said, it makes sense to create a faster and simpler way
of  accurately  monitoring  and  verifying  the  sulfur  level  of  the  fuel
that  is  being  sold.  So,  we  support  H.R.  547,  but  we  also  strongly
urge  the  Subcommittee  to  make  one  change,  to  add  EPA  as  part
of  the  intergovernmental  team  that  will  implement  this  bill.  After
all, EPA is the agency that is charged with overseeing with the im-
plementation  of  ULSD.  It  is  the  agency  that  is  charged  under  the
Clean  Air  Act  with  maintaining  fuel  quality.  For  lots  of  different
reasons,  EPA  is  involved  in  fuel  quality  at  every  step  in  the  proc-
ess, and they should be part of this team as well.

Now,  allow  me,  if  I  may,  to  just  spend  a  moment  on  the  alter-
native  fuels  provisions  of  this  bill.  Developing  methods  and  tech-
nologies  and  procedures  to  increase  the  compatibility  of  bio-based
alternative  fuels  with  our  nation’s  conventional  fuel  distribution
system  makes  sense.  It  is  another  good  idea  worthy  of  consensus.
Biofuels  will  never  replace  petroleum  at  the  level  we  need  to  get
energy  independence  and  address  global  warming  if  the  biofuels
have to be trucked from the biorefinery to the retail outlet.

17

There  is  also—so  addressing  that  issue  is  important.  But  there
is  another  issue  here  as  well.  Not  all  alternative  fuels  are  alike.
Some  offer  significant  lifecycle  emissions  reductions  in  global
warming  pollutants,  for  example,  cellulosic  ethanol,  while  others
can be worse than, or in the best case, roughly equivalent to gaso-
line, coal to liquids fuels would be the example there. So, it is crit-
ical that we pursue biofuels in a way that not only helps on energy
security,  but  it  also  reduces  global  warming  pollution.  And  like-
wise,  it  is  critical  that  the  future  of  biofuels  strategies  address
other environmental issues that will come up, forestry issues, land
use issues, and so on.

Now,  H.R.  547  can’t  solve  all  of  the  challenges,  or  address  all  of
the  challenges  of  our  future  bio-economy,  but  it  can  help.  It  can
help in two ways: first, by adding EPA to the alternative fuel provi-
sions as well; and second, by clearly defining the various fuels pro-
visions  in  the  bills.  Right  now,  there  are  four  different  fuels  provi-
sions in it. And clearly defining those, so that the research is mov-
ing towards fuels that are sustainable, not just for energy security,
but  for  global  warming,  for  the  forestry  and  land  use  issues,  and
others.

Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify.

Introduction:  The  Importance  of  Transitioning  to  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel

Fuel and Biofuels

America’s  continuing  reliance  on  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel  for  its  transportation
needs  contributes  to  a  range  of  critically  important  environmental  and  energy  con-
cerns.  H.R.  547  will  help  transition  the  Nation  to  cleaner,  more  sustainable  fuels
in two key areas.
H.R. 547 and the Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel Transition

H.R. 547 can help transition the Nation to the Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (‘‘ULSD’’)

fuel that is critical to reducing diesel pollution nationwide.

More  than  150  million  people  live  in  areas  that  fail  to  meet  EPA’s  health  stand-
ards for ozone and/or particulate matter, in part due to emissions from today’s dirty
diesel vehicles.1 In cities and towns throughout the Nation, dirty trucks, buses, con-
struction  equipment  and  other  diesel  engines  contribute  a  disproportionately  large
share  of  the  particulate  matter  (PM)  that  triggers  asthma  attacks,  bronchitis,  and

roughly  25,000  premature  deaths  every  year.  In  addition,  more  than  35  percent  of
the nitrogen oxides (NOΧ) emissions that are key ozone precursors come from diesel
engines.2

Thanks  to  EPA’s  landmark  Highway  Diesel  Rule,3 more  than  90  percent  of  the
health  impacts  from  today’s  dirty  diesel  trucks  and  buses  will  be  eliminated  over
the next two decades, as today’s engines are replaced by new engines that meet the
Rule’s stringent emission standards for PM and NOΧ.

The  health  benefits  of  implementing  EPA’s  diesel  programs  successfully  will  be
enormous. When all of today’s engines have been replaced by new engines that meet
the  standards  set  in  the  Highway  Diesel  Rule,  which  EPA  estimates  will  occur  in
2030, more than 8,300 premature deaths, 1.5 million lost work days, and $66 billion
in  net  health  and  other  costs  will  be  eliminated  every  year.4 Combined  with  EPA’s
Nonroad  Diesel  Rule,  the  combination  of  ULSD  and  new  engines  that  meet  the
standards  of  these  two  rules  will  eliminate  more  than  20,000  premature  deaths,
tens  of  thousands  of  child  asthma  emergencies  and  other  respiratory  illnesses,  and
more than $140 billion in health costs every year in 2030.5

ULSD  fuel  is  the  key  to  achieving  these  pollution  reductions  and  public  health
benefits.  Today’s  modern  diesel  engines  are  equipped  with  extremely  sophisticated
catalysts and filters that can reduce harmful PM and NOΧ by more than 90 percent.
However,  all  of  these  emission  control  technologies  are  extremely  sensitive  to  the
sulfur levels of the fuel. Indeed, higher-than-expected sulfur levels can impair—and
even disable—these technologies. Just as it was critical to eliminate leaded gasoline
to enable the use of effective catalytic converters two decades ago, it is now critical
to use ULSD fuel to enable the effective use of today’s diesel emission control tech-
nologies.

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  transition  to  ULSD  is,  in  fact,  running  smoothly.
Since mid-October, at least 80 percent of the Nation’s highway diesel fuel has been
required  to  be  ULSD,  pursuant  to  the  Highway  Diesel  Rule.  In  fact,  EPA  has  re-
ported that more than 90 percent of the highway diesel fuel is already ULSD.6 Con-
sequently,  the  heavy-duty  engine  industry  has  moved  forward  with  its  2007  offer-
ings, all of which require ULSD.

NRDC  shares  EPA  and  industry  concern  about  the  lack  of  ULSD  labels  at  many
service  stations  around  the  Nation.7 However,  there  is  a  big  difference  between  a
labeling  issue  and  an  availability  issue.  The  evidence  is  now  clear  that  ULSD  is
widely  available,  in  excess  of  the  minimum  required  by  the  Highway  Diesel  Rule.
With  ULSD  now  in  the  marketplace,  many  car  makers  have  announced  plans,
with  great  fanfare,  to  introduce  clean,  fuel-efficient  diesel  cars,  light  trucks,  and
sport-utility vehicles to the Nation’s showrooms next year. Indeed, these diesel vehi-
cles  were  the  centerpiece  of  last  week’s  Washington  Auto  Show  and  similar  shows
around the Nation over the past few months. All of these diesel vehicles will require
ULSD to operate cleanly and effectively. Car makers would not be so excited about
their potential to sell new diesel passenger vehicle models next year if they had any
concerns  about  the  retail  availability  of  the  ULSD  fuel  that  these  vehicles  will  re-
quire.

Moreover, EPA has developed effective mechanisms to ensure that diesel fuel that
leaves  the  refinery  gates  as  ULSD  arrives  at  the  terminal  and  the  retail  seller  as
ULSD. These mechanisms have evolved since 2001, in large part due to EPA’s ongo-
ing  dialogue  with  stakeholders  throughout  the  refining,  distribution,  and  retailing
industries. For example, last year, EPA provided a temporary increase in the sulfur
testing  tolerance,  as  well  as  an  amended  ULSD  tracking  system  in  response  to  in-
dustry concerns.8 While we understand that the same retailers would prefer a sim-
pler  system  of  verification  and  monitoring  and  we  support  R&D  programs  that  are
designed  to  create  methods  and  technologies  for  such  a  system,  we  also  think  that
it  is  important  to  note  that  the  current  ULSD  transition  has  been  a  smooth  one  so
far.

H.R. 547 and the Biofuels Transition

19

H.R. 547 can help transition the Nation to biofuels that will help end our depend-

ence on oil, and that can reduce global warming pollution as well.

It  is  well-known  that  the  Nation  remains  dependent  on  oil  for  its  transportation
needs,  most  of  which  comes  from  some  of  the  world’s  most  unstable  and/or  un-
friendly  nations.  And,  it  is  equally  well-known  that  this  oil  dependence  contributes
greatly  to  the  ever-growing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  contribute  to  global
warming.

A  comprehensive  strategy  that  combines  increased  vehicle  efficiency  with  in-
creased  use  of  biofuels  can  reduce  virtually  all  of  our  projected  gasoline  demand  in
2050, as illustrated in the graph below.

However,  not  all  ‘‘alternative  fuels’’  are  alike.  Some  offer  significant  life  cycle
emissions  reductions  in  global  warming  pollutants  (e.g.,  cellulosic  ethanol),  while
others can be worse than (or, in the best case, roughly equivalent to) gasoline (e.g.,
coal-to-liquid fuels), as the chart below shows.9 Thus, it is critical that Congress and
the President pursue oil savings in a way that also produces global warming pollu-
tion savings.

In sum, it is critically important that EPA’s Highway Diesel Rule is implemented
successfully, and it is critically important that Congress and the President take ac-
tion  to  ensure  that  the  Nation  ends  its  dependence  on  oil  in  a  way  that  simulta-
neously  reduces  global  warming  pollution.  H.R.  547  can  play  a  meaningful  role  in
succeeding in both efforts.
NRDC Supports H.R. 547 with Modifications

With  minor  modifications,  H.R.  547  can  play  a  meaningful  role  towards  ensuring
the  effective  transition  to  ULSD,  and  towards  ensuring  that  increased  biofuels  are
effectively incorporated into the Nation’s fuel infrastructure and transportation sys-
tems.  However,  the  modifications  that  NRDC  proposes  are  critically  important  to
the ultimate success of the bill, and to our support.

First,  it  is  critical  to  add  EPA  as  part  of  the  team  that  will  implement  H.R.  547.
Currently, the bill directs the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the National
Institute of Standards and Technology only, to carry out an effective program of re-
search,  development,  demonstration  and  commercial  application  of  materials  to  be
added  to  alternative  bio-based  fuels  and  ULSD,  and  to  seek  portable,  low-cost  and
accurate ULSD testing methods and technologies, to make each of these fuels more
compatible with our existing fuel storage and delivery infrastructure. However, EPA
is the agency charged with implementing the Highway Diesel Rule and the Renew-
able  Fuel  Standard.  EPA  is  the  agency  with  responsibilities  under  the  Clean  Air
Act,  as  amended,  and  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  to  create  effective  programs  to
monitor fuel quality throughout the system. Indeed, for the past six years, EPA has
worked  closely  with  industry  and  other  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  the  ULSD  that
comes  out  of  the  Nation’s  refineries  arrives  at  the  pump  as  ULSD.  And,  as  noted
above,  EPA  has  managed  the  transition  to  ULSD  successfully.  While  further  R&D
efforts  may  provide  added  benefits  to  the  ongoing  ULSD  transition,  NRDC  believes
strongly  that  those  efforts  will  be  most  successful  if  EPA  is  a  designated  member
of  the  inter-governmental  team  that  oversees  this  work  and  implements  H.R.  547.
Second,  many  terms  in  H.R.  547  have  to  be  defined  clearly.  While  ULSD  is  an
accepted  term  already,  phrases  like  ‘‘advanced  fuels,’’  ‘‘bio-based  fuels,’’  ‘‘alternative
bio-based  fuels,’’  and 
‘‘alternative  fuels’’  are  used  seemingly  interchangeably
throughout  the  bill.10 Given  our  concerns  about  energy  security  paths  that  would
not  reduce  global  warming  pollution,  about  the  potential  increased  use  of  coal-to-
liquid  fuels,  and  about  the  wide  range  of  current  and  potential  alternatives  to  con-

10 It  is  worth  noting  that  ‘‘Low  Sulfur  Diesel’’  is  not  defined  in  the  bill  either.  Presumably,
this term refers to diesel fuel containing no more than 500 parts-per-million sulfur. In the final
bill,  NRDC  encourages  the  Subcommittee  to  clearly  define  both  Low  Sulfur  Diesel  and  ULSD.

ventional  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel  under  consideration,  clarifying  these  definitions
is  critical.  As  noted  above,  NRDC  does  not  support  energy  security  policies  that  do
not simultaneously address global warming.

Last,  NRDC  believes  that  the  bill  draft  provided  to  us  earlier  this  month  would
benefit  from  some  minor  text  editing.  We  have  provided  these  edits  to  committee
staff, and include those that are not reflected in our prior two paragraphs here:

• Page 2, line 7: delete ‘‘newer.’’
• Page 2, line 10: insert ‘‘potentially’’ before ‘‘placing.’’
• Page 2, line 21–25: after ‘‘sale’’ in line 25, insert ‘‘if not transported properly’’

and replace ‘‘can’’ with ‘‘may’’ in line 21.
• Page 3, line 14: replace ‘‘and’’ with ‘‘or.’’

Conclusion:

Certainly,  the  Nation  would  benefit  from  programs  that  help  ensure  the  smooth
transition to ULSD and an increased use of biofuels. H.R. 547 appears to be a mean-
ingful  step  towards  both  of  these  important  steps.  However,  NRDC  strongly  urges
the  Subcommittee  to  make  the  modifications  suggested  herein  before  moving  this
bill forward.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.

BIOGRAPHY FOR RICHARD KASSEL

RICH KASSEL is a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council and
directs  NRDC’s  Clean  Vehicles  and  Fuels  Project.  He  is  an  internationally-recog-
nized expert on diesel and other fuel and vehicle pollution issues.

Highlights of Mr. Kassel’s projects include:

• Working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help develop and
implement  EPA’s  Highway  Diesel  and  Nonroad  Diesel  Rules.  When  all  of  to-
day’s engines have been replaced by new engines that meet EPA’s new stand-
ards, more than 20,000 premature deaths and $150 billion in health costs will
be eliminated annually.

• Working with the Pataki Administration and the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority to create a ‘‘Clean Fuel Bus Program’’ for the New York City Tran-
sit  bus  fleet,  the  largest  fleet  in  North  America.  As  a  result  of  this  program,
particulate  matter  (PM)  emissions  from  the  MTA  buses  are  97  percent  lower
than they were in 1995, and the program is a model for fleets worldwide.

• Working  with  U.S.  EPA,  the  United  Nations  Environment  Program,  and  a
range  of  industry  and  other  stakeholders  to  create  the  Partnership  for  Clean
Fuels  and  Vehicles  in  2002.  The  Partnership  works  in  developing  countries
around  the  world  to  eliminate  leaded  gasoline  where  it  is  still  used,  and  to
help countries develop plans to reduce diesel and other vehicle pollution.

• Working with local and global vehicle experts to create clean vehicle pollution
plans for Mexico and Brazil that combine clean fuel standards, more stringent
emission regulations and accelerated ‘‘retirement and retrofit’’ programs to re-
duce air pollution in Mexico City and Sao Paolo.

Mr.  Kassel  is  a  member  of  many  technical  advisory  committees.  These  include
EPA’s Clean Air Act Advisory Committee, its Mobile Sources Technical Review Sub-
committee,  its  Clean  Diesel  and  Retrofit  Work  Group  and  its  former  Clean  Diesel
Implementation  Review  Panel;  the  Health  Effects  Institute’s  Special  Committee  on
Emerging  Technologies  and  the  Steering  Committee  for  HEI’s  Advanced  Collabo-

STATEMENT OF MR. BOB DINNEEN, PRESIDENT AND CEO,

RENEWABLE FUELS ASSOCIATION

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you
for  the  invitation,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee.
On  behalf  of  the  members  of  the  Renewable  Fuels  Association,
which  is  the  national  trade  association  representing  the  U.S.  eth-
anol  industry,  I  want  to  express  my  strong  support  for  H.R.  547,
the  Advanced  Fuels  Infrastructure  Research  and  Development  Act.
This bill and this committee’s continued commitment to expanding
the technical foundation for a more robust renewable energy indus-
try  in  this  country  will  be  critical  to  breaking  this  nation’s  addic-
tion to oil.

Already,  the  U.S.  ethanol  industry  is  making  great  strides  and
dramatically  reducing  our  dependence  on  imported  petroleum.
There  are  today  111  biorefineries  in  operation  across  the  country
that  are  processing  more  than  1.8  billion  bushels  of  grain  into  ap-
proximately  5.4  billion  gallons  of  high  quality,  high  octane  renew-
able  ethanol.  Ethanol  has  indeed  become  a  ubiquitous  component
of  the  U.S.  motor  fuel  market.  Today,  it  is  blended  in  46  percent
of  our  nation’s  fuel.  It  is  blended  literally  from  coast  to  coast  and
border  to  border.  Every  single  gallon  of  gasoline  sold  in  California
is blended with ethanol. Every single gallon of gasoline sold in the
great city of New York is blended with ethanol. It is no longer just
a  niche  Midwest  market.  It  is  a  national  fuel,  and  it  is  continuing
to grow.

Indeed,  ethanol  is  providing  perhaps  the  most  significant  tool
that we have today to reduce our dependence on imported oil. Just
since the year 2000, 30 percent of the increase in gasoline demand
in  this  country  has  been  met  by  ethanol.  To  take  a  shorter  time-
frame,  look  at  just  last  year,  when  gasoline  demand  increased
about  a  billion  gallons,  ethanol  production  and  use  in  this  country
increased well more than a billion gallons. We satisfied about 110,
115 percent of our increase in gasoline consumption last year. That
is  gasoline  that  we  don’t  have  to  import.  That  is  helping  to  break
that addiction to oil already.

The  U.S.  ethanol  industry  already  today  is  contributing  signifi-
cantly  to  this  nation’s  energy  and  economic  security.  The  five  bil-
lion gallons of ethanol that were produced last year added $41 bil-
lion  to  gross  output,  created  160,000  jobs,  contributed  $2.7  billion
in  increased  tax  revenue  to  the  Federal  Government,  and  reduced
oil imports by 170 million barrels, a value of some $11 billion. But
the ethanol industry is continuing to grow. There are today 78 eth-
anol  biorefineries  under  construction.  That  is  steel  on  the  ground,
people on the site, the facilities going up, including, Mr. Chairman,
five  in  the  great  state  of  Texas.  Indeed,  there  are  as  many  plants
under construction in Texas as there are in Illinois. And plants are
going  up  outside  the  traditional  Midwest.  There  are  plants  under
construction in Arizona, in New Mexico, in Idaho. There are plants
in  the  Northeast,  the  Southeast.  We  are  becoming  a  national  pro-
duction  center  as  well,  which  is  important  to  understand,  as  we
look to some of these infrastructure issues.

Yes,  today,  ethanol  is  not  shipped  by  pipeline.  That  is  not,  then,
a  hindrance  at  all  to  ethanol  marketing,  because  we  have  created
a virtual pipeline, not just by trucks. Most ethanol today is shipped

by  rail  and  by  barge,  and  we  are  able  to  get  ethanol  anywhere  in
the  country  where  it  needs  to  be,  cheaper  than  if  we  were  to  put
our  product  on  a  barge,  send  it  down  the  river  to  Houston,  where
we  would  load  it  up  on  the  pipeline,  where  then  it  would  go.  We
can get there faster and quicker. And when you think about home-
land security issues, the way that ethanol is distributed is probably
a  lot  safer,  and  as  the  ethanol  industry  continues  to  grow  in  the
way that it is all across the country, it will provide a great number
of opportunities as well.

The  point,  though,  is  that  the  ethanol  industry,  which  is  today
largely a blend component with gasoline, as we grow, we are going
to  saturate  that  blend  market.  We  have  a  140  billion  gallon  gaso-
line  market  in  this  country.  We  will  saturate  10  percent  ethanol
blends in that market probably some time in 2008 or 2009. But we
have got to grow beyond that. We are going to grow with new feed-
stocks as well, and once you have cellulosic ethanol production, and
there is not an ethanol company that I represent that doesn’t have
a very aggressive cellulose to ethanol research program, the oppor-
tunities  for  ethanol  are  going  to  expand  exponentially.  We  will
need markets beyond just the additive market.

E–85  represents  a  tremendous  opportunity,  but  that  E–85  mar-
ket  is  not  yet  mature.  It  is  not  yet  there.  There  are  some  six  mil-
lion E–85 vehicles on the road today, and that is terrific, but there
needs  to  be  a  lot  more  to  encourage  Mr.  Eichberger’s  members  to
put  in  the  infrastructure  necessary  to  create  the  refueling  infra-
structure.  The  commitments  by  Ford  and  General  Motors  to
produce as much as 50 percent of their vehicles as flexible fuel ve-
hicles  that  could  utilize  E–85  by  2012  is  terrific.  That  would  get
you  about  four  million  additional  E–85  vehicles  beginning  in  that
year, perhaps as many as 35 total—35 million total on the road by
2017.  It  is  a  great  start,  but  we  need  to  do  more  than  that.  With
a greater demand for E–85, the infrastructure will follow.

Bills  like  this,  H.R.  547,  that  will  allow  that  infrastructure  to
grow,  and  to  understand  the  issues  associated  with  that  growth,
will  be  a  critical  important  step  in  finally  breaking  that  addiction
to oil, and again, I appreciate the opportunity to testify.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Dinneen follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF BOB DINNEEN

Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Subcommittee.  My  name  is
Bob  Dinneen  and  I  am  president  of  the  Renewable  Fuels  Association,  the  national
trade association representing the U.S. ethanol industry.

This  is  an  important  and  timely  hearing,  and  I  am  pleased  to  be  here  to  discuss
the growth in the domestic ethanol industry, and the increasingly important role of
continued  research  and  development  of  infrastructure  for  our  nation’s  biofuels  in-
dustry.  The  rapid  growth  of  our  domestic  ethanol  industry  since  the  passage  of  the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) had led to the growth of ethanol’s virtual pipeline.
The  continued  expansion  of  the  industry  will  require  greater  development  of  infra-
structure  in  many  areas  around  the  country.  Research  into  the  feasibility  of  trans-
porting  ethanol  by  pipeline  from  the  Midwest  to  the  East  and  West  coasts,  such  as
the provisions outlined in H.R. 547, will also be important.

The  ethanol  industry  today  is  on  the  cutting  edge  of  technology,  pursuing  new
processes,  new  energy  sources  and  new  feedstocks  that  will  make  tomorrow’s  eth-
anol  industry  unrecognizable  from  today’s.  Ethanol  companies  are  already  utilizing
cold  starch  fermentation,  corn  fractionation,  and  corn  oil  extraction.  Companies  are
pursuing more sustainable energy sources, including biomass gasification and meth-
ane  digesters.  And  there  is  not  an  ethanol  company  represented  by  the  RFA  that
does not have a cellulose-to-ethanol research program.

The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  can  have  an  important  role  in  accel-
erating  these  efforts  by  promoting  and  targeting  research  and  development  funds
appropriately. The U.S. ethanol industry has identified several areas where new re-
search can advance the renewable energy agenda further:

• Increase utilization of co-products and development of new co-products;
• Development  of  harvesting  equipment,  and  tools  to  streamline  the  transpor-

tation and storage of cellulose feedstocks;

• Improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption; and,
• Improve cellulose feedstock conversion technologies.

Support  through  research  to  build  upon  the  industry’s  advancements  in  tech-
nologies  will  be  critical  to  the  future  growth  of  the  biofuels  industry.  Programs  au-
thorized by EPAct, such as the cellulose ethanol loan guarantee programs (Title XV
and  Title  XVII)  and  biorefinery  grant  program  (Section  932(d) ),  to  accelerate  the
commercialization of cellulose ethanol must be fully funded.
Background

Today’s ethanol industry consists of 111 biorefineries located in 19 different states
with  the  capacity  to  process  more  than  1.8  billion  bushels  of  grain  into  5.4  billion
gallons  of  high  octane,  clean  burning  motor  fuel,  and  more  than  12  million  metric
tons of livestock and poultry feed. It is a dynamic and growing industry that is revi-
talizing  rural  America,  reducing  emissions  in  our  nation’s  cities,  and  lowering  our
dependence on imported petroleum.

Ethanol has become an essential component of the U.S. motor fuel market. Today,
ethanol is blended in more than 46 percent of the Nation’s fuel, and is sold virtually
from  coast  to  coast  and  border  to  border.  The  almost  five  billion  gallons  of  ethanol
produced and sold in the U.S. last year contributed significantly to the Nation’s eco-
nomic,  environmental  and  energy  security.  According  to  an  analysis  completed  for
the  RFA,1 the  approximately  five  billion  gallons  of  ethanol  produced  in  2006  re-
sulted in the following impacts:

• Added $41.1 billion to gross output;
• Created 160,231 jobs in all sectors of the economy;
• Increased  economic  activity  and  new  jobs  from  ethanol  increased  household

income by $6.7 billion, money that flows directly into consumers’ pockets;

• Contributed  $2.7  billion  of  tax  revenue  for  the  Federal  Government  and  $2.3

billion for State and local governments; and,

• Reduced oil imports by 170 million barrels of oil, valued at $11.2 billion.

In  addition  to  providing  a  growing  and  reliable  domestic  market  for  American
farmers,  the  ethanol  industry  also  provides  the  opportunity  for  farmers  to  enjoy
some  of  the  value  added  to  their  commodity  by  further  processing.  Farmer-owned
ethanol plants account for half of the U.S. fuel ethanol plants and almost 40 percent
of industry capacity.

This  dynamic  and  growing  industry  is  also  empowering  more  of  America  to  have
a  vital  role  in  our  nation’s  infrastructure.  If  a  farmer  in  Des  Moines  doesn’t  want
to invest in the local co-op, he can choose to invest in a publicly traded ethanol com-
pany through the stock market. As can a school teacher in Boston, or a receptionist
in  Seattle.  Americans  coast-to-coast  have  the  opportunity  to  invest  in  our  domestic
energy  industry,  and  not  just  in  ethanol,  but  biodiesel  and  bio-products.  U.S.  agri-
culture is evolving in very important ways, and rural America is primed to take ad-
vantage of these opportunities.

There  are  currently  78  biorefineries  under  construction.  With  seven  existing  bio-
refineries expanding, the industry expects more than six billion gallons of new pro-
duction  capacity  to  be  in  operation  by  the  end  of  2009.  The  following  is  our  best
estimate of when this new production will come online.

Infrastructure

The  existing  motor  fuel  pipeline  system  was  built  by  the  Federal  Government  to
accommodate  an  oil  and  gas  industry  producing  in  the  Gulf  Coast.  To  utilize  the
existing  pipeline  system,  ethanol  producers  would  have  to  ship  ethanol  first  to  the
Gulf Coast to load up on a pipeline. It would be much more cost effective to instead
ship the ethanol directly to the markets that demand the fuel.

Thus,  over  the  past  several  years,  the  ethanol  industry  has  worked  to  expand  a
‘‘Virtual Pipeline’’ through aggressive use of the rail system, barge and truck traffic.
As  a  result,  we  can  move  product  quickly  to  those  areas  where  it  is  needed.  Many
ethanol plants have the capability to load unit trains of ethanol for shipment to eth-
anol  terminals  in  key  markets.  Unit  trains  are  quickly  becoming  the  norm,  not  the
exception,  which  was  not  the  case  just  a  few  years  ago.  Railroad  companies  are
working with our industry to develop infrastructure to meet future demand for eth-
anol.  The  biofuels  industry  is  working  closely  with  terminal  operators  and  refiners
to  identify  ethanol  storage  facilities  and  install  blending  equipment.  We  will  con-
tinue to grow the necessary infrastructure to make sure that in any market we need
to  ship  ethanol  there  is  rail  access  at  gasoline  terminals,  and  that  those  terminals
are able to take unit trains.

Incidentally, the existing oil and gas pipeline system itself is filled to near capac-
ity  today.  The  fact  that  ethanol  does  not  have  to  be  shipped  on  those  pipelines,  be-
cause  the  ethanol  industry  can  get  our  product  to  the  markets  where  it  needs  to
go  with  the  ‘‘Virtual  Pipeline,’’  means  that  consumers  are  able  to  get  10  percent
more volume shipped to their area on existing pipelines that is helping to hold down
the cost of gasoline.

That said, many stakeholders in the biofuels industry are beginning to look at the
practical  issues  involved  with  shipping  ethanol  via  a  dedicated  pipeline.  Shipping
ethanol  in  pipelines  is  done  today  in  Brazil,  and  it  has  been  done  at  times  in  the
U.S.  as  well,  in  dedicated  pipelines.  If  the  marketplace  demands  it,  as  it  does  in
Brazil, and there is enough ethanol demand to warrant the investment in the infra-
structure for dedicated pipelines, such a system will develop in the U.S.

The Renewable Fuels Association has also supported the concept of regional ‘‘cor-
ridors’’ that concentrate the E–85 markets first where the infrastructure already ex-
ists.

Ethanol  today  is  largely  a  blend  component  with  gasoline,  adding  octane,  dis-
placing  toxics  and  helping  refiners  meet  Clean  Air  Act  specifications.  But  the  time
when  ethanol  will  saturate  the  blend  market  is  on  the  horizon,  and  the  industry
is  looking  forward  to  new  market  opportunities.  As  rapidly  as  ethanol  production
is expanding, it is possible the industry will saturate the existing blend market be-
fore a meaningful E–85 market develops. In such a case, it would be most beneficial
to  allow  refiners  to  blend  ethanol  in  greater  volumes,  e.g.,  15  or  20  percent.  The

ethanol  industry  today  is  engaged  in  testing  on  higher  blend  levels  of  ethanol,  be-
yond  E–10.  There  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  today’s  vehicle  fleet  could  use  higher
blends.  An  initial  round  of  testing  is  underway,  and  more  test  programs  will  be
needed.  Moving  to  higher  blend  levels  with  our  current  vehicle  fleet  would  have  a
significant  positive  impact  on  the  U.S.  ethanol  market,  without  needing  to  install
new  fuel  pumps  and  wait  for  a  vehicle  fleet  to  turn  over  in  the  next  few  decades.
It might also allow for a smoother transition to E–85 by growing the infrastructure
more steadily.
Research  &  Development,  Deployment  and  Commercialization  of  New

Technologies

The Department of Energy’s Advanced Energy Initiative has set a goal of making
cellulosic ethanol costs competitive by 2012. Funding for additional research in cut-
ting-edge  methods  of  producing  ethanol  from  corn  stover,  wheat  straw,  rice  straw,
wood  chips  and  switch  grass—to  name  just  a  few—will  play  a  critical  role  in  the
Initiative’s success or failure.

The  most  effective  way  to  speed  the  commercialization  of  cellulose  ethanol  is  to
fully  fund  the  programs  enacted  in  the  Energy  Policy  Act  of  2005  (EPAct)  for  re-
search and development for cellulosic ethanol. The technology exists to process eth-
anol  from  cellulose  feedstocks;  however,  commercialization  of  cellulosic  ethanol  re-
mains  a  question  of  economics.  The  capital  investment  necessary  to  build  cellulosic
ethanol  facilities  remain  about  five  times  that  of  grain-based  facilities.  Those  costs
will, of course, come down once the first handful of cellulosic facilities are built, the
bugs  in  those  ‘‘first  mover’’  facilities  are  worked  out,  and  the  technology  continues
to advance. The enzymes involved in the cellulosic ethanol process also remain a sig-
nificant  cost,  as  well.  While  there  has  been  a  tremendous  amount  of  progress  over
the  past  few  years  to  bring  the  cost  of  those  enzymes  down,  it  is  still  a  significant
cost relative to processing grain-based ethanol.

Increasing  funding  for  such  EPAct  programs  as  the  federal  loan  guarantee  pro-
gram  for  cellulose-based  biorefineries,  and  the  biorefinery  grant  program  would  do
more  to  advance  the  commercialization  of  cellulose  ethanol  in  a  shorter  period  of
time  than  to  enact  any  of  the  cellulose-related  legislation  proposed  since  EPAct  as
enacted.  Funding  for  EPAct  programs  like  the  bioenergy  program  for  biofuels  and
bioproducts  would  encourage  industry  and  university  partnerships  to  develop  price
competitive  biochemical  and  thermo  chemical  conversion  technologies 
from
lignocellulosic feedstock and enzyme-based processing systems.

As Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV) production is ramped up, it is important to encour-
age the use of the most efficient technologies. Some FFVs today experience a reduc-
tion in mileage when ethanol is used because of the differences in BTU content com-
pared to gasoline. But the debt can be easily addressed through continued research
and  development.  For  example,  General  Motors  has  introduced  a  turbo-charged
SAAB  that  experiences  no  reduction  in  fuel  efficiency  when  E–85  is  used.  There  is
also technology being development that utilizes ‘‘variable compression ratio engines’’
that  would  adjust  the  compression  ratio  depending  on  the  fuel  used.  Thus,  if  the
car’s computer system recognized E–85 was being used, it would adjust the compres-
sion  ratio  to  take  full  advantage  of  ethanol’s  properties.  This  technology  could  dra-
matically  improve  E–85  economics  by  eliminating  or  substantially  reducing  the
mileage penalty associated with existing FFV technology.
Conclusion

The  109th  Congress  enacted  several  polices  that  clearly  put  our  nation  on  a  new
path toward greater energy diversity and national security. Additional and more fo-
cused  research  and  development  programs,  and  increased  funding  levels  for  EPAct
2005  programs,  will  be  critical  to  the  rapid  deployment  and  commercialization  of
new technologies for biofuels. Infrastructure will need to continue to expand and ad-
vance  as  the  biofuels  market  does.  The  continued  commitment  of  this  committee,
the introduction of legislation such as H.R. 547, and the 110th Congress will all con-
tribute to ensuring America’s future energy security.

Thank you.

ronmental groups in order to provide for marketplace growth for the industry. These
coalitions have resulted in an historic Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) fuels agree-
ment and passage of the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC).

Mr.  Dinneen  has  presented  testimony  before  the  Congress  and  federal  agencies
on  numerous  occasions,  and  represented  the  ethanol  industry’s  interests  at  State,
national and international forums.

Prior  to  joining  the  RFA,  Mr.  Dinneen  worked  on  Capitol  Hill  for  various  Mem-
bers  of  Congress  and  Congressional  Committees.  Mr.  Dinneen  graduated  from  the
Catholic University of America with a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science.

DISCUSSION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  all  of  you,  for  com-
ing. It is a tremendously interesting subject, and one that hopefully
we will be able to move quickly enough to make a difference for all
of us.

ETHANOL TRANSPORTATION COSTS

Let  me  start  with  the  questioning  at  this  time,  and  I  would  like
to first ask Mr. Dinneen, you mentioned that because ethanol can’t
be  shipped  by  standard  pipeline  like  conventional  fuels,  the  indus-
try is developing a virtual pipeline that consists of rail, barge, and
truck shipping, which is considerably more expensive.

What  proportion  of  the  market  price  for  ethanol  is  attributable
to  transportation  and  distribution,  and  how  does  this  compare  to
traditional fuels?

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Well,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  not  sure  I  would  agree

with a couple premises to the question.

First  of  all,  it  is  true  ethanol  is  not  shipped  by  pipeline  today,
but  it  is  not  true  that  it  cannot  be  shipped  by  pipeline.  Ethanol  is
shipped  all  over  Brazil  via  pipeline,  in  multiple  product  pipelines.
It  has  been  shipped  in  this  country  as  well  in  dedicated  pipelines,
and will be again, if the marketplace demands it. In Brazil, 40 per-
cent  of  their  motor  fuel  is  ethanol,  so  there  is  a  tremendous  need
for pipeline shipments. In this country, while five billion gallons of
ethanol  produced  last  year  is  a  tremendous  amount,  it  is  still  less
than  three  percent  of  the  total  motor  fuels  in  this  country,  and  so,
there  really  isn’t  a  marketplace  pull  for,  or  the  necessity  for  pipe-
line shipments.

But  we  have  created,  as  you  say,  the  virtual  pipeline.  The  cost
is maybe $0.14 to get ethanol from the Midwest to either coast, but
the  cost  of  shipping  that  same  product  via  pipeline  would  be  darn
close to that anyway. So, there really isn’t an increased cost associ-
ated with that, and the marketplace would figure those issues out.
The  real  issue  is,  is  the  market  going  to  develop  such  that  a  pipe-
line  is  necessary.  There  have  been  bills  that  have  been  introduced
to  study  that  issue,  and  determine  whether  or  not  it  would  make
sense, but quite frankly, if you have got significant ethanol produc-
tion in all regions of the country, which it looks like you are going
to have, because there are plants in the Northeast, there are plants
in  the  Northwest,  then  you  may  have  the  product  close  enough  to
the  markets,  where  significant  pipelines  aren’t  really  going  to  be
practical.

But I think there are a number of issues you need to look at.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Okay.  We  are  trying  to—at  this  point,  you
can’t  really  say,  or  project  a  specific  savings  by  doing  the  research

necessary  to  get  to  a  point  where  we  can  use  those  pipelines.  Cor-
rect?

Mr. DINNEEN. Correct.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Okay.  You  also  mentioned  unit  trains  in
your testimony. Does ethanol require specialized or dedicated train
cars, trucks and barges dedicated only to that?

Mr. DINNEEN. No. Any chemical tank can accommodate fuel eth-

anol.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Okay.  What  is  the  industry-wide  cost  esti-
mate  for  producing  or  procuring  this  type  of  virtual  pipeline,  and
why is this more cost-effective than a conventional pipeline system?
Mr.  DINNEEN.  As  I  said,  I  mean  the  marketplace,  I  think,  is
going to develop, as we see, where the production is, and maybe an
actual pipeline will be useful. But if you have got plants located all
across  the  country,  where  is  the  pipeline  going  to  be,  and  how  do
you  get  it  onto  the  pipeline?  It  is  not  the  situation  you  have  got
with  the  oil  industry,  where  you  have  concentration  in  the  Gulf
Coast, and you know, ready access to the pipeline system.

It may be that over time, when you are talking about 30, 40, 50,
60  billion  gallons  of  ethanol,  that  a  pipeline  will,  indeed,  make
sense, but I am not sure that that is clear at this point.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you.

CURRENT SUBSIDIES AND TAX INCENTIVES

Mr.  Eichberger,  there  are  currently  some  150,000  fuel  retailers
in the U.S., with approximately 1,000, or less than one percent sell-
ing E–85. How effective are current subsidies and tax incentives in
helping  retailers  transition  to  alternative  fuels,  and  what  are  the
shortcomings?

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  The  current  subsidies  are  helpful.  A  lot  of  our
retailers  who  have  installed  the  E–85  have  done  so  with  the  help
of  the  tax  credits  that  are  in  the  system  right  now.  Anything  that
is going to help offset the cost of installation is going to be helpful.
However, as I mentioned in my testimony, there are so many other
factors  involved,  and  Mr.  Dinneen  mentioned  what  is  the  level  of
demand?  How  many  vehicles  can  run  on  these—on  this  fuel,  and
how many drivers of those vehicles know they can?

There  are  other  bills  that  have  been  considered  in  Congress,  to
take  CAFE  credits,  and  make  those  into  some  sort  of  grant  pro-
gram through the Clean Cities Initiative. We have been supportive
of  those  as  well.  This  legislation,  I  think,  if  successful,  will  make
all  those  incentive  programs,  perhaps,  obsolete.  If  we  can  get  to  a
point where E–85 and B–100 and other alternative fuels can be put
directly  into  the  existing  storage  tank  infrastructure  without  the
costly  renovations,  you  are  going  to  remove  that  barrier  to  entry.
And then, we are going to be dealing with the market-based forces,
demand, supply, and cost competitiveness.

BIODIESEL FUEL QUALITY CONCERNS

Chairman  LAMPSON.  One  of  the  things  that  I  have  been  looking
at and trying to consider within the language of this particular bill
has  to  do  with  no  sulfur  biodiesel.  Is  that  adequately  addressed

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

29

within the language of this bill, because most of it speaks to Ultra-
Low or Low Sulfur Diesel, which is petrodiesel?

Anybody there.
Mr. EICHBERGER. I don’t have an answer for that.
Mr.  KASSEL.  The  biodiesel  that  is  being  sold,  whether  it  is  in  a
low  blend,  a  B–2  or  B–5,  or  a  higher  blend,  B–20,  still,  in  each
case, it is being sold in a setting where the bulk of the fuel is con-
vention  diesel.  So,  it  is  the  sulfur  level  of  that  piece  of  it,  that  80
to 98 percent, that is really critical, if the goal is to make sure the
package  of  the  blended  fuel  is  low  enough  in  sulfur  to  be  compat-
ible with the new emission controls.

I  think  the  bigger  issue  that  has  come  up  on  this  issue  of  bio-
diesel  and  sulfur  levels,  and  the  new  technologies  and  the  new
standards, is the extent to which the blended biodiesel itself is cre-
ating other issues that may, I am not going to say impair, but per-
haps create challenges, or—for some of the new technologies. Some
of  the  engine  companies  have  been  saying  that  they  are  concerned
about  warranty  issues  with  biodiesel  blends  that  are  over,  say,  a
B–20.  Now,  if  you  had  a  full  100  percent  biodiesel  fuel,  the  sulfur
level  would  have  to  be  low  enough  that  there  would  be  other  fuel
quality  issues  that  would  come  about.  It  is  not  particularly  a  big
issue. Nobody is running B–100 in any significant way, and I don’t
think  anybody  is  projecting  it,  although  I  have  a  feeling  Mr.
Dinneen will correct me if I am wrong about that.

But  I  think  the  big  issue  here  is  that  I  don’t  think  sulfur,  per

se, is an issue going forward for biofuel, for biodiesel.

Chairman LAMPSON. Okay.
Mr.  DINNEEN.  The  Renewable  Fuels  Association  represents  eth-
anol  producers,  so  biodiesel  is  not  in  my  wheelhouse.  However,  I
am  unaware  that  there  is  any  sulfur  content  whatsoever  in  bio-
diesel,  and  in  fact,  one  of  the  reasons  biodiesel  is  being  used  in
blends today is to help refiners meet the Low Sulfur Diesel require-
ments,  so  I  think  if  you  move  forward,  and  you  create  additional
opportunities for biodiesel, it will have a benefit in terms of sulfur.
Chairman LAMPSON. Hence my question. And I yield, now, to Mr.

Inglis.

ETHANOL INFRASTRUCTURE CONCERNS

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Tell me, what is it that makes ethanol tough on equipment?
Mr.  DINNEEN.  Congressman,  I  don’t  think  the  ethanol  used
today,  in  10  percent  blends,  there  are  no  technical  issues,  fully
warranted  by  all  auto  manufacturers.  It  is—the  infrastructure  is
there.  There  are  some  questions  about  if  you  move  to  higher  level
blends, E–85, whether or not there are some corrosive issues there,
because of the alcohol. However, I should note that there are 1,000
E–85  pumps  across  the  country,  many  of  which  have  been  there
for,  have  been  out  there  for  close  to  ten  years  or  more  now,  and
there has never once been an incident of failure. And while Under-
writers  Laboratories  has  recently  indicated  that  it  wants  to  certify
those pumps, and do some research to do so, it has been clear that
it—they have not heard of any incidences.

So, we are confident that E–85 will be compatible with the exist-
ing  infrastructure,  and  we  are  working  with  UL  and  other  stake-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

30

holders  to  get  them  the  comfort  level  that  they  need  to  again  cer-
tify  those  pumps.  The  manufacturers  of  the  pumps  themselves  are
willing  to  certify  each  of  the  individual  components  of  the  pumps,
but they just want UL to certify that also.

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  Clearly,  there  is  an  interest  in  getting  the  E–
85  dispensers  certified  by  UL.  Retailers  across  the  Nation  who
want  to  do  E–85  need  to  have  that  for  liability  reasons.  Some  of
the concerns with higher concentrations of ethanol are its corrosive
properties.  Metal  can  corrode,  and  when  they  corrode,  they  can
spring  leaks.  That  is  why  so  much  equipment  has  to  be  replaced
when  you  are  converting  to  a  new  system.  If  your  equipment  has
not  been  certified  as  compatible,  you  run  the  risk  of  corrosion,  or
nonmetal  items  possibly  degrading  and  cracking  and  swelling,  and
losing your fittings, and that is the issue.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Because  there  is  something  more—maybe  Mr.  Bart-
lett  can  explain  this  to  me  later—is  why  it  is  that  ethanol  is  more
corrosive.  There  is  something  about  it,  I  guess,  that  is  more  corro-
sive than gasoline. When is it mixed? Right now, it is by barge and
by whatever, but when does it actually get mixed? At the terminal?
Mr.  DINNEEN.  It  is  blended  with  gasoline  at  the  gasoline  ter-
minal, so for this area, for example, the—Newington is the gasoline
terminal that services virtually all of the Washington metropolitan
area,  and  there  will  be  tanks  filled  with  gasoline.  There  will  be  a
tank  with  ethanol  there  as  well.  A  truck  will  pull  up,  and  if  he
wants  to  blend—if  he  is  going  to  an  Exxon  station  or  a  Shell  sta-
tion,  he  puts  in  a  card,  and  if  it  is  going  to  be  ethanol  blended,  as
it  would  be  in  this  area,  he  is  drawing  fuel  from  both  tanks,  and
in  inline  blending  systems,  the  truck  is  then  filled  at  that  point,
and the blending occurs at that point.

Mr.  INGLIS.  So,  the  gasoline  comes  to  the  terminal  by  pipeline,
and the ethanol comes by truck or barge, or some way to get there.

Mr. DINNEEN. Yes.

FUEL ADDITIVES

Mr. INGLIS. And when—we are now requiring this as an additive,
right?  We  have  replaced  MBE,  is  it?  Help  me  remember  what  we
did there?

Mr. EICHBERGER. With the reform of the gasoline program, which
is  required  in  the  most  polluted  cities,  you  have  to  use—prior  to
the  Energy  Bill,  you  had  to  use  a  two  percent  weight  of  oxygen.
That  could  be  accomplished  by  using  methyl  tertiary  butyl  ether,
MTBE, or ethanol. The majority of the Nation used MTBE, because
it  could  be  blended  at  the  refinery,  was  cheaper  for  the  refiners  to
obtain, because they produced it, shipped in the pipeline directly to
retail.

With  the  Energy  Bill  and  the  elimination  of  the  oxygen  require-
ment,  and  the  liability  concerns  associated  with  MTBE,  the  refin-
ing industry decided they are not going to use MTBE any more and
switched  to  ethanol.  Now,  that  there  was  a  major  transition,  and
now  almost  every  gallon  of  RFG  in  the  Nation  has  a  5.7  percent,
I think, Bob, of ethanol in it.

Now,  there  is  the  opportunity  to  start  producing  a  non-
oxygenated  RFG,  but  that  is  still  pretty  much  in  its  infancy.  So,
that was the issue of the transition there.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  so,  this  travels  through  the  pipeline  with  that

31

level of ethanol in it, right?

Mr. EICHBERGER. No.
Mr. INGLIS. No?
Mr.  EICHBERGER.  Even  with  RFG,  it  is  blended  at  the  terminal.
Mr. INGLIS. Okay. So——
Mr. EICHBERGER. All ethanol is shipped via rail, barge, or truck.
Mr.  INGLIS.  And  as  to  the  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel,  as  I  under-
stand it, that would pass through the same pipeline that, say, gaso-
line and Jet A is passing through, right?

Mr. EICHBERGER. Right.
Mr.  INGLIS.  And  that—help  me  understand.  I  think  I  know  that
you  put  this  thing  called  a  pig,  right,  in  there,  then  you  push—it
separates the product?

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  Not  necessarily.  Actually,  the  products  are
butted  up  against  each  other  just  through  viscosity  barriers.  So,
you  will  have  gasoline  and  diesel,  jet  fuel,  right  up  against  each
other.  Because  the  pipelines  change  size  throughout  the  system,
you  can’t  necessarily  put  a  pig  in  there.  Some  places  you  can,  but
traditionally  we  are  not  using  pigs.  When  they  are  butted  up
against  each  other,  and  they  come  in  the  terminal  for—offloaded
from  the  pipeline,  certain  cuts  are  made,  what  is  called  transmix,
where  the  two  products  have  been  blended  together,  that  is  pulled
out  and  put  into  whichever  fuel  is  allowed  to  accept  it,  and  that
is how it is distributed.

So,  the  reason  there  was  so  much  concern  about  contamination
of  ULSD  going  through  the  pipeline  is  you  have  jet  fuel  going
through, with about 3,000 parts per million sulfur. How do you se-
quence  the  product  in  the  pipeline  to  make  sure  that  Ultra-Low
Sulfur Diesel is protected? We have been very successful, and that
has happened. ULSD has come through the pipeline with very little
contamination,  and  when  it  gets  down  to  retail,  we  have  a  pretty
good shot of getting clean product.

Mr. INGLIS. Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much. I will yield five min-

utes to the gentlelady from California, Ms. Woolsey.

ETHANOL SOURCE CONCERNS

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In my district, the demand for ethanol has resulted in a scarcity
and  a  dramatic  rise  in  the  price  of  corn,  which  has  had  quite  an
effect,  a  huge  effect,  actually,  on  the  local  family  dairies  in  my
area. They can’t afford feed, I mean, and they are really feeling it.
So,  Mr.  Dinneen,  ethanol  can’t  be  the  only  advanced  fuel  tech-
nology,  so  what  other  fuels  are  we  looking  at  that  you  would
project will be in our future?

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Well,  two  comments.  I  think  first  of  all,  with  re-
spect to the price of corn, the marketplace just recently got the sig-
nal to dramatically expand corn acres, and I believe that most ana-
lysts  expect  eight  to  ten  million  acres  planted  in  corn  this  year,
which will have a beneficial impact on corn prices.

When  you  produce  ethanol  from  grain  today,  we  are  only  using
the  starch,  and  what  is  left  behind  is  a  very  high  value,  high  pro-
tein  feed  grain  that  is  then  used  for  dairy  markets,  poultry  mar-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

kets,  and  other  feed  uses.  But  the  industry  certainly  understands
that  we  can’t  grow  to  the  levels  that  people  want  us  to  grow,  and
that  we  want  to  grow,  on  grain  alone.  And  indeed,  that  is  why  we
are  working  so  hard  on  cellulosic  ethanol  technologies.  There,  as  I
indicated,  there  is  not  an  ethanol  plant  that  I  represent  that
doesn’t  have  a  very  aggressive  cellulose  to  ethanol  research  pro-
gram,  because  they  already  have  cellulose  coming  into  the  plant,
and  indeed,  there  will  be  pilot  plants  opening  up  shortly,  that  will
be  producing  ethanol  from  a  variety  of  different  feedstocks,  and  if
the  Energy  Bill’s  loan  guarantee  programs  are  authorized  and  ap-
propriated in this continuing resolution, I think you will see a cou-
ple of companies begin to construct commercial scale cellulosic eth-
anol plants. We are on the cusp of seeing that technology commer-
cialized, and it is a very exciting time in the industry.

Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well,  thank  you  for  that,  and  so,  then,  Mr.
Eichberger, as we, the markets grow, and regions specialize in dif-
ferent crops, cellulosic, grains, sugar, for ethanol production, as an
automobile drives across the country and fills their tank, will every
tank  be  able  to  take  any  one  of  these  kinds  of  fuels?  I  mean,  or
will——

Mr. EICHBERGER. If it is used as an additive to the gasoline, yes.
Ethanol  is  ethanol  is  ethanol.  If  you  are  talking  about  higher  con-
centrations  like  E–85,  no.  Only  flexible  fuel  vehicles,  specially  for-
mulated,  can  run  on  that  product.  But  if  a  typical  gasoline—car  is
running  across  the  Nation,  they  can  fill  up  anywhere  they  want
with  regard—without  concern  whether  or  not  it  is  a  corn-fed  eth-
anol, cellulosic ethanol, or sugar.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Kassel, you looked like you wanted to respond

Mr. KASSEL. I did. I wanted to make two brief points. One is with
respect to the corn question that you raised. I think it—there is an
analogy that I think is useful, and that what has to happen in the
ethanol,  and  more  broadly,  biofuels  world  is  analogous  to  what
happened in the food production world roughly 100 years ago.

Because  of  Kellogg  and  C.W.  Post  and  others,  they  were  able  to
dramatically increase the yield per acre. You know that, I am sure,
from your farming constituents.

Ms. WOOLSEY. I thought you were going to say because I am that

to that.

old that I remember it.

Mr. KASSEL. No, no, absolutely not. Absolutely not. But a similar
phenomenon  has  to  happen,  and  is  starting  to  happen,  in  the
biofuels  world,  where  the  research  is  going  into  cellulosic  ethanol,
and  how  to  increase  the  crop  yields,  and  to  use  more  of  the  plant,
so we can use the full plant, the nonfood part of the plant. Because
ultimately,  if  we  are  going  to  meet  the  goals,  35  billion  gallons  a
year,  that  were  laid  out  in  the  State  of  the  Union  last  week,  or
other  very  aggressive  goals  to  wean  ourselves  off  oil,  and  to  curb
global warming pollution, we have to be able to provide biofuels in
a  way  that  is  environmentally  sustainable.  We  don’t  want  to  re-
place  concerns  about  petroleum  with  concerns  about  how  we  are
using land. Are we taking product from the food chain and putting
it into the fuel chain? Are we taking—is the Amazon rainforest be-
coming biofuels? We don’t want any of that to happen. That is why

the type of research that Mr. Dinneen is talking about is so impor-
tant, and I think it is so exciting as well.

The  second  point  that  I  wanted  to  make  goes  to  the  driver  in  a
few years driving across country. If Congress and the President put
into place an energy savings and global warming package that real-
ly  gets  us  off  our  current  pathway,  and  there  are  different  pro-
posals going around, of course, to start to do that, and if we merge
that  into  what  is  coming  out  of  Detroit  and  Japan,  Germany,  and
the  other  car  producing  countries,  we  can  start  to  see  a  future
where people are driving different kind of cars based on what their
needs are, and there will be people who drive long distances on the
highway,  they  have  a  70  mile  commute  on  an  interstate  to  get  to
work,  and  they  will  choose  a  very  clean,  high  efficiency  diesel  car.
Somebody  else,  who  drives  in  the  urban  setting,  stop  and  go  driv-
ing, who is also concerned about fuel prices, is also concerned about
global  warming,  will  choose  a  hybrid.  Somebody  else  will  choose  a
flexible  fuel  vehicle,  and  they  will  be  driving  with  E–85,  and  I
think  if  we  forecast  out  10  or  15  years  from  now,  it  will  be  like
other consumer products that we use, that there will be much more
of  a  mix,  much  more  of  a  marriage,  if  I  may,  between  the  type  of
driving we are doing and the type of car and fuel we are choosing,
and that will create synergies that will address the different issues
that  you  have  raised,  and  that  are  really—underlie  why  this  bill
makes sense.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  The  gentlelady’s
time has expired. My friend from Texas, Ralph Hall from Rockwall,
the Ranking Member on the Science Committee. Five minutes.

EPA INVOLVEMENT

Mr.  HALL.  I  thank  you,  Mr.  Lampson.  And  I  am  sorry  I  haven’t
been  here  to  hear  your  testimony.  I  have  read  it,  or  had  some  of
it read to me. I—Mr. Kassel, I want to ask you something about—
you  have  recommended,  I  understand,  that  H.R.  547  be  amended
to include the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the pro-
grams  in  the  bill,  and  other  representations  in  conjunction  with
that.  And  I  would  ask  some  other  information  from  Mr.  Dinneen
and  Mr.  Eichberger,  but  before  I  do,  let  me  just  say  to  you  and  to
the  Chairman,  Chairman  Lampson,  with  whom  I  have  known  a
long, long time, and worked with him before. We were both Demo-
crats together a long time ago, and I have high regard for him, and
I have high regard for Bart Gordon, and for the Members that are
in  the  majority  today,  and  it  is  their  bill,  and  I  am  a  co-sponsor
on it, and I think Mr. Inglis is also a co-sponsor on it. So, this bill
has—is  going  to  pass,  and—but  as  you  know,  the  bill  before  us
today  was  included  in  H.R.  6203,  which  was  Representative  Judy
Biggert’s bill. It was passed by the House last Congress by a voice
vote under suspension of the rules. Now, H.R. 6203 contained a lot
of provisions that we really wanted in this bill, but this is Mr. Gor-
don’s  bill,  and  this  is  Mr.  Lampson’s  bill,  and  they  are  in  control
of  this  committee,  and  they  are  in  control  of  the  House,  and  it  is
good  legislation,  but—and  we  didn’t  insist,  and  I  didn’t  come  up
here with a bunch of amendments to send up to cause them to vote
no  on  some  things  that  they  really  would  want  to  vote  yes  on,  but
they  don’t  want  to  slow  this  bill  down.  And  I  am  not  going  to  be

a  part  of  slowing  the  bill  down,  because  I  am  for  the  bill.  I  want
it  to  get  out,  get  through  the  House,  get  to  the  Senate,  and  get  to
the President, who will sign it.

But we—it contained provisions to promote research and develop-
ment  in  areas  such  as  biofuels,  hydrogen,  solar,  wind,  plug-in  hy-
brids, energy efficient buildings, and coal gasification, and we think
all  these  things  were  good,  and  the  same  people  on  the  other  side
of  the  docket  were  on  those  bills,  too.  And  I  am  just  hoping,  Mr.
Chairman,  that  later,  as  we  can  put  those  bills  together,  we  can
work together to pick these things up, and pass them, too.

I  understand,  at  the  end  of  the  Hundred  Hours,  that  you  want
to get a bill, and you want to get it to the Floor, get it passed, with-
out being burdened down with a bunch of amendments, and we are
not  sending  those  up  just  to  make  somebody  look  bad,  or  make
them  vote  on  them.  We  are  hoping  that  this  committee  is  success-
ful, and we hope Bart Gordon is successful, because he is a decent
guy, and a good leader. And our purpose is going to be to pass leg-
islation, not to get even with anybody.

As  the  Ranking  Member  for  the  Republican  Party,  I  want  to
make  that  statement,  and  I  think  it  is  something  that  we  can  all
live with later on down the road.

So,  my  question  to  Mr.  Dinneen  and  Mr.  Eichberger,  is  if  the
EPA  should  be  included  in  H.R.  547,  and  is  there  an  amendment
to  that  effect?  None.  Tell  me  about  your  reason  for  wanting  to  in-
clude it. Are you in the same position I am in, that it is also good,
and would be good in this, but you are not asking them to slow the
bill down? You want it to whistle on through.

Mr.  KASSEL.  We  don’t  want  to  slow  this  bill  down.  We  think  it
is important to do the kind of research and development that is in
this  bill.  We  just  offer  that  suggestion  as  a  way  to  make  it  a
smoother  implementation  going  forward.  EPA  is  the  agency  which
is  responsible  under  the  Clean  Air  Act  and  the  Energy  Policy  Act
of 2005 with implementing the key regulations that govern the way
fuel  is  moved  through  the  system,  whether  it  is  Ultra-Low  Sulfur
Diesel  fuel  or  the  renewable  fuel  standard  that  EPA  will  finalize
fairly soon.

I understand that there is an intention across the board that peo-
ple  hope  that  DOE  and  NIST  will  collaborate  with  EPA,  and  that
is great. If that can be memorialized in the bill, that is even better.
But  we  certainly  don’t  want  to  slow  it  down,  and  so,  I  hope  that
this suggestion won’t slow it down.

Mr.  HALL.  And  the  R&D  proposals  that  I  set  forth,  that  were  in
the  other  bill,  supported  by  the  present  Chairman  and  Chairman
of this subcommittee, are good legislation for the future.

Mr. KASSEL. Well, I will be honest and say and admit that I don’t
remember  the  specifics  of  H.R.  6203,  and  exactly  what  was  in  it,
but  certainly  NRDC  is  extremely  involved  in  advancing  policies
that increase the use of wind, solar, and other forms of alternative,
and we would be happy to take a look at——

Mr.  HALL.  Well,  let  me  quickly  ask  Mr.  Dinneen  and  Mr.
Eichberger. My time has expired, so on expired time, could you give
me  a  short  answer  as  to  your  opinion  of  the  proposal  that  I  have
made?

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  Mr.  Hall,  I  mean,  our  focus  on  the  bill  is  can
the  research  be  successful  to  provide  these  bridges  for  retailers,
and if the EPA is involved, we have no problem with that?

Mr. DINNEEN. Yes and yes.
Mr. HALL. I yield back my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Hall.  Next,  we  have  five

minutes from Mr. McNerney from California.

ULTRA-LOW SULFUR DIESEL COSTS

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  I  need  to  learn  how  to  use  a  microphone,  with

the assistance of Lynn Woolsey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I  think  this  is  a  really  great  first  step,  H.R.  547.  In  my  district,
we  have  a  particular  problem  with  diesel  pollution,  and  so,  I  am
really  thrilled  to  see  us  move  to  the  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel,  and
I am concerned about the mixing of diesel with—Low Sulfur Diesel
with  higher  forms  of  diesel,  particularly  in  our  area,  but  you  have
sort  of  addressed  those  questions  already.  And  I  am  wondering,
what  are  we  going  to  see  in  terms  of  cost  effect  for  the  consumer
for  the  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel  in  the  long  run,  as  opposed  to  the
higher forms of diesel?

Mr.  KASSEL.  Right  now,  the  incremental  cost  is  running  a  little
higher  than  expected,  comparing  to—there  was  a  report  that  just
came  out  in  the  last  week  or  so,  that  did  a  comparison  of  Ultra-
Low Sulfur Diesel compared to, say, regular gasoline. I suppose the
authors  of  that  report  were  looking  at  a  future  car  market  that
would  be  bifurcated  between  gasoline  and  diesel,  showed  about  a
$0.20  to  $0.30  gap  between  regular  diesel  and  Ultra-Low  Sulfur
Diesel.  Now,  I  don’t  know  that  that  is  really  the  right  comparison,
because it is a little bit of apples and oranges.

When  the  rule  was  first  promulgated  by  EPA,  they  suggested  a
cost  increment  of  about  $0.04  to  $0.05  a  gallon  between  standard
500  part  per  million  sulfur  and  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel,  and  over
time, my guess is that is probably about right. We will see.

You know, when you look at fuel prices, the incremental costs of
the  desulfurization  is  a  small  piece.  The  real  issue  is  the  price  of
a  barrel  of  oil  and  the  refinery  margins.  Those  are  the  two  big
pieces.  The  ultra-low  sulfur  component  is  going  to  be  relatively
small.

DIESEL PERFORMANCE

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Well,  the  high  performance  diesels  are  an  im-
provement, both in terms of emissions and in terms of performance.
They  get  more,  maybe  30  percent  more  performance  per  gallon
than  gasoline.  So,  do  you  see  this  as  something  that  is  going  to
incentivize  private  vehicles  to  be  using  diesel  technology,  diesel
fuels?

Mr.  KASSEL.  Absolutely.  There  is  no  question  about  it.  The—if
you  had  a  chance  to  go  to  the  Washington  Auto  Show  last  week,
there were car companies that were—many car companies pushing
and  pushing  their  diesel  vehicles.  Daimler  had  a  huge  announce-
ment,  where  they  announced  that  they  had  the  first  pickup  truck
that  was  going  to  meet  not  the  2007  pollution  standards,  but  the

2010  standards  already.  So,  the  question  of  can  you  make  a  diesel
clean  has  now  been  answered  definitively,  and  the  answer  is  yes.
So, then the question is will people buy a diesel car? And I think
the  answer  to  that  is  that  for  the  driver  who  is  concerned  about
fuel  prices,  and  who  wants  to  do  what  they  can  ahead  of  time,
when  they  buy  their  car,  to  reduce  the  hit  of  higher  fuel  prices  in
the future, they are going to look at these diesel cars. They are also
going to look at hybrids. They are going to look at a range of vehi-
cles.  And  that  is  all  good  news.  We  are  really  entering  a  new  era
of  cleaner  cars,  more  fuel  efficient  cars,  and  I  think  that  is  all  for
the good.

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  Congressman,  the  auto  industry  was  strongly
behind  the  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel  regulations,  in  support  of  it
from  the  beginning,  and  one  of  the  theories  is,  I  mean,  if  you  get
higher  fuel  economy  with  a  diesel  engine,  and  you  start  putting
that  into  your  fleet,  you  have  just  improved  your  ability  to  comply
with  CAFE  standards,  so  I  would  suspect  that  as  ULSD  becomes
more prevalent, and all the kinks are worked out, you are going to
see a lot more automakers start to turn towards diesel engines for
their passenger vehicles.

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  One  other  question  is,  and  I  don’t  understand
this  very  clearly,  is  the  relation  between  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel
and biodiesel. Are they mixable with any problems, or what are the
sort of issues that we are looking at in that——

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  For  the  most  part,  there  aren’t  too  many
issues,  as  long  as  the  biodiesel  is  ultra-low  sulfur  as  well.  There
were  some  early  concerns,  when  I  spoke  to  the  Bio  Board  a  couple
years  ago,  that  some  used  food  oils,  that  if  there  were  onions  in
there,  you  may  have  some  trace  sulfur  level  in  there,  so  that  was
an early concern, but in terms of compatibility, as long as they are
both ultra-low sulfur, you shouldn’t have a problem.

There are some concerns with high concentrations of biodiesel in
colder  climates  that  you  can  get  a  gelling  effect  in  the  product.
What has happened is during those colder months, the suppliers of
biodiesel at the retail level have just reduced the percentage of bio-
diesel as a component of diesel fuel that they are selling.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Thank you. Are there any other issues regarding
diesel, promoting diesel in this bill, that we should be aware of, or
amendments that you would recommend?

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  I  don’t  know  of  any  amendments  I  would  rec-
ommend. I would comment that Mr. Kassel earlier commented that
90  percent  of  the  fuel,  diesel  fuel,  is  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel.  And
just  to  clarify,  that  is  90  percent  of  the  diesel  fuel  being  produced
at  the  refinery  is  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,
when it goes to the pipeline, and you start cutting batches, you do
have  some  downgrading,  so  not  all  of  the  Ultra-Low  Sulfur  Diesel
being produced is making it to retail, which is causing some slow—
a little bit of slowness, in terms of the conversion of some retail lo-
cations.

Mr. MCNERNEY. I yield.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  McNerney,  and

now, Mr. Roscoe Bartlett from Maryland. Five minutes.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you very much.

Mr. BARTLETT. Sir?
Chairman LAMPSON. I should have said Dr. Bartlett. Pardon me.

MORE ETHANOL PRODUCTION CONCERNS

Mr. BARTLETT. There are obviously three reasons for being inter-
ested  in  alternatives.  One  is  the  environment,  which  has  been  a
major focus here. A second is the national security interest. We are
getting far too much of our fuels from, as the President says, from
people  who  don’t  even  like  us.  And  the  third  one,  which  I  think  is
the  most  dominant  one,  that  is,  that  the  oil  just  may  not  be  here,
if you believe in peak oil.

Anybody who has listened to any of my 21, now, full hour speech-
es  on  the  floor  of  the  Congress  knows  that  there  is  no  bigger  sup-
porter of alternatives in the country than Roscoe Bartlett, but just
a  word  of  caution,  please.  We  need  to  be  realistic,  or  we  will  lose
the  American  people.  My  colleague,  who  was  my  Ranking  Member
when  I  chaired  this  subcommittee  several  Congresses  ago,  Ms.
Woolsey, mentioned that corn had gone up. From September to De-
cember, it almost doubled in price, and then, as you said, gee, that
is  an  easy  fix,  we  will  just  plant  more  acres  of  corn.  Sir,  all  the
land  that  should  be  planted  in  corn  is  now  planted  in  corn.  And
what  is  going  to  happen  is  that  land  is  going  to  be  taken  out  of
agricultural preserve, and it is going to be farmed, and corn is one
of  the  greediest  crops  we  have.  It  is  the  one  of  the  worst  for  ero-
sion.  It  is  certainly  one  of  the  worst  for  sucking  up  nutrients  out
of the soil, and for the relatively small impact we have on the envi-
ronment,  because  each  gallon  of  ethanol,  if  you  are  really  good,
each gallon of ethanol will represent at least three-fourths of a gal-
lon  of  fossil  fuel  in  producing  it—said  it  represents  more  than  a
gallon  of  fossil  fuel  in  producing  it.  But  let  us  say  that  you  can  be
good  enough  to  have  only  three-fourths  of  a  gallon,  which  means
that  the  small  improvement  you  get  in  air  quality  may  be  over-
ridden by the big decrement you are going to have in land, because
if  you  plant  more  acres  in  corn,  you  have  more  acres  in  corn,  it  is
going  to  be  land  that  shouldn’t  be  farmed,  that  is  now  not  being
farmed, because of agricultural preserve, and you are going to have
a lot of erosion.

I  took  your  numbers,  sir,  five  billion  barrels  of  ethanol,  gallons
of ethanol last year, and 170—that saved 170 million barrels of oil.
So, I multiplied the 170 million barrels of oil by 42 gallons per bar-
rel, and I got seven billion. How in the heck can five billion gallons
of  ethanol  save  seven  billion  gallons  of  oil?  It  can’t,  of  course.  And
the  reality  is  that—the  reality  is  even  if  you  had  those  figures  in
sync,  that  each  gallon  of  ethanol  saves  only  three-fourths  of  a  gal-
lon of fossil fuel. You are really recycling fossil fuels, in large meas-
ure, when you are burning ethanol, are you not?

See,  my—I  am  a  huge  fan  of  renewables,  but  we  have  got  to  be
honest with the American people. We face a really, really big crisis
here, a big challenge, and this bill doesn’t even—I am going to vote
for  it,  because  it  is  a  little  better  than  nothing,  but  it  doesn’t  even
nibble  at  the  margins  of  the  problem.  You  are  going  to  get  a  rel-
atively small improvement in air quality at a big decrement in land
quality,  if  you  plant  more  of  our  land  in  corn.  And  by  the  way,  al-
most half the energy in producing a bushel of corn comes from the

natural  gas.  An  enormously  important  feedstock  for  a  big  petro-
chemical  industry,  and  all  of  our  nitrogen  fertilizer  today  comes
from natural gas, and almost half of the energy that goes into pro-
ducing corn comes from the natural gas.

I  just  want  to  be  realistic  with  the  American  people.  Making
more  ethanol  is  not  going  to  solve  our  problem.  We  are  not  Brazil,
thank you. They have far fewer cars. They have sugar cane, which
is  a  better  harvester  of  sunlight  than  we.  We  brag  that  we  have
a  very  efficient  agriculture,  because  one  man  sits  on  a  150  horse-
power  tractor  and  feeds  50  people  here  and  a  bunch  of  others
around  the  world.  In  terms  of  energy  in,  and  energy  out,  we  may
have one of the least efficient agricultures in the world, because we
have  an  incredible  amount  of  energy  that  goes  in,  for  some  crops,
ten  calories  in  and  one  calorie  out.  It  is  better  than  that  for  corn,
thank  goodness.  But  if  you  look  at  all  the  energy  constraint,  don’t
you  think  that  the  American  people  will  support  us  better  if  we
were really honest with them?

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Congressman,  I  agree  with  you,  and  I  think  we

have been honest with the American people.

Mr. BARTLETT. You know, a couple of you guys were just not hon-
est. You do not save 170 million barrels of oil with five billion gal-
lons of ethanol. It is silly.

Mr.  DINNEEN.  I  will  get  to  the  analysis,  and  we  can  go  through

the numbers.

Mr. BARTLETT. You don’t save even a fourth of that, sir.
Mr. DINNEEN. Congressman, I will go through the numbers with
you,  with  the  economist  that  did  that  analysis.  And  we  will  see
where the differences——

Mr.  BARTLETT.  The  economist  did  not  count  costs  that  he  didn’t

know, I suspect. Go ahead.

Mr. DINNEEN. The point is, Congressman, I think the fact of the
matter  is,  we  have  never  told  the  American  people  that  ethanol  is
the answer. It is part of the answer, and we need to do a lot more.
We have not said that ethanol can replace all of gasoline. We have
not  said  that  you  are  going  to  use  all  of  the  Nation’s  corn  crop  to
produce  ethanol.  We  have  said  that  there  are  limitations  to  what
you can produce from grain. According to the National Corn Grow-
ers,  they  think  you  can  get  as  much  as  15  billion  gallons.  Beyond
that, you would have a detrimental impact on feed prices, and they
don’t want to go there, and neither does our industry. That is why
our  industry  is  working  so  hard  on  a  range  of  technologies,  new
processes and new feedstocks.

And I think the great thing about what is happening today, Con-
gressman,  is  that  you  get  a  lot  of  new  capital  coming  into  the  in-
dustry, and a lot of new intellectual capital coming into the indus-
try. And the industry is going to be unrecognizable five years from
now.  Congressman,  there  are  plants  that  are  looking  at  biomass
gasification  to  run  those  facilities.  That  would  certainly  improve
the energy balance numbers. You have companies in Texas that are
locating  the  ethanol  facilities  at  feedlots,  that  are  feeding  the  dis-
tillers  dried  grains  directly  to  the  cattle  on  the  lot,  capturing  the
methane  from  the  feedlot  to  run  the  facility,  and  it  is  a  very  inte-
grated  process.  That  is  the  future  of  this  industry.  And  it  is  not
just  grain,  it  is  not  just  today’s  technology,  but  if  you  aren’t  doing

everything that you possibly can to make sure that there are mar-
kets  for  these  alternative  fuels,  you  are  not  going  to  get  a  future
where  you  have  got  cellulosic  ethanol,  and  you  have  got  more  sus-
tainable processes.

I mean, nobody here has done more than you, Congressman, and
I commend you for all that you have done to raise awareness about
the  dangers  of  our  dependence  on  imported  oil,  and  the  risks  that
we, as a nation, face when we are looking at peak oil. I am not sure
I  have  seen  all  21,  but  I  have  seen,  you  know,  15  or  16  of  them.

Mr. BARTLETT. Thank you.
Mr.  DINNEEN.  And  they  are  not  just  entertaining,  they  are  edu-
cational.  And  I  try  to  get  my  teenagers  to  come  and  sit  down,  and
say  look  at  this  guy.  He  is  talking  about  the  future.  We  are  part
of  the  future.  We  are  not  the  entire  answer,  but  we  are  part  of  it.

ETHANOL INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Chairman.  A  very,

very interesting hearing.

A little while ago, somebody mentioned Brazil as a country. They

use sugar, is that correct?
Mr. DINNEEN. Correct.
Mr.  DIAZ-BALART.  As  their  energy.  Can  you  give  me  an  idea  of
what  are  some  of  the  environmental  issues  that  Brazil  has  found
that—with  creating  ethanol  from  sugar,  number  one,  and  number
two  is,  are  those  issues  that  can  be  dealt  with  here,  and  number
two  is,  where  are  we  as  far  as  cost,  for  developing  ethanol  from
sugar in the United States versus corn, and is that something that
could,  as  the  market  progresses,  could  improve—could  progress  to
help solve the issue of some of the things that we have heard about
corn?

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Brazil  has  built  a  tremendous  ethanol  industry
through  30  years  of  tax  incentives,  government  mandates,  infra-
structure, development, tariffs, and a range of—debt forgiveness, a
range of programs. And I say that, commending them, because they
have  made  a  real  investment  in  their  ethanol  industry,  and  today,
a  combination  of  ethanol  production  and  increased  oil  production,
Brazil is energy independent, and I think that that is terrific.

We  can’t  replicate  the  Brazilian  model  here  for  a  whole  host  of
reasons,  some  of  them  having  to  do  with  our  labor  market,  some
of  them  having  to  do  with  our  climate,  some  of  them  having  to  do
with  our  population  and  our  industry.  But  I  think  it  is  a  model  to
look at to see what can be done, in terms—if there is real commit-
ment  to  renewable  fuels,  and  to  alternative  fuels.  There  are  envi-
ronmental  consequences  from  Brazilian  production.  They  don’t
have  the  emissions  control  at  the  plant  that  we  have.  They  don’t
have  the  kind  of  controls  that  EPA  places  on  our  facilities,  and
those  might  be  some  issues.  They  don’t  have  some  of  the  labor
standards  that  we  certainly  have,  and—but  I  say  that  in  terms  of
what  is  going  on  at  the  plant.  In  terms  of  emissions  at  the—when
used  as  a  fuel,  their  experience  is  going  to  be  the  same  as  ours,

40

because  as  Mr.  Eichberger  said,  ethanol  is  ethanol  is  ethanol,  no
matter the feedstock, and ethanol is going to help reduce emissions
by the vehicles.

Brazil has built a heck of an industry, in part, because they have
incentivized  consumers  to  purchase  flexible  fuel  vehicles.  And
about 50 percent of the vehicles in Brazil today are flexible fuel ve-
hicles that can run on E–85. The other 50 percent of those vehicles
are  running  on  a  blend  of  between  20  and  25  percent  ethanol,  a
level  that  changes,  and  the  government  sets  it,  but  it  has  been  a
very successful model.

Mr. KASSEL. Yeah, if I can just add a couple of thoughts. I think
what  we  can  learn  from  the  Brazilian  experience  is  two  things.
First  of  all,  setting  a  goal  for  energy  independence  is  something
that  is  achievable,  if  the  country  actually  gets  to  work  to  actually
do it. And they set that goal, and the combination of their domestic
production  and  their  ethanol  production  has  allowed  them  to
achieve it. It didn’t happen overnight, but it did happen.

Second,  the  thing  that  we  can  learn  from  the  Brazilian  experi-
ence  is  the  importance  of  the  infrastructure.  If  you  go  to  a  service
station  in  San  Paulo,  you  see  gasoline  and  you  see  ethanol.  You
also see diesel. But you see the gasoline, you see the ethanol. Con-
sumers  make  a  choice  if  they  have  the  flex  fuel  vehicle,  based  on
the  price.  Which  one  are  they  going  to  buy  today?  And  the  prices
fluctuate,  and  the  consumption  patterns  fluctuate,  but  the  key
thing  is  that  the  infrastructure  is  there.  So,  we  can  sell  all  the  E–
85  vehicles  we  want,  but  if  there  is  not  E–85  tanks  at  the  service
stations, then we are not going to be able to maximize what we can
do with ethanol.

I think there are two things, though, that we can also learn from
Brazil  that  are  not  so  good.  The  first  is  the  land  use  and  forestry
issues.  Now,  the  first  time  I  looked  at  the  Brazilian  situation,
somebody  said  to  me,  oh,  there  is  no  rainforest  issue  there.  There
is  no  rainforest.  Look  at  the  map,  and  this  is  not  a  map  of  Brazil,
but  I  will  use  it.  They  said  the  rainforest  is  over  here,  and  the
sugar  production  is  over  here.  Oh,  that  sounds  pretty  good.  But
then,  I  asked  where  is  the  cattle?  And  the  cattle  is  over  here  next
to the rainforest. What is actually happening? The sugar is pushing
the cattle north. The cattle is moving into the rainforest. So, there
is—so,  without  adequate  controls,  valuable  rainforest  is  indirectly
being  cut  down.  We  have  got  our  own  version  of  that,  in  terms  of
CRP  land  and  forestry  issues  and  so  on.  We  have  to  make  sure
whatever we do with biofuels, we are taking all those into account.
The  second,  I  think,  lesson  we  can  learn  from  them  is  they  had
one  goal.  It  was  energy  independence.  They  secured  it.  It  is  great.
But  now,  the  world  we  know  is  much  more  complicated,  and
achieving energy independence, if we don’t also tackle global warm-
ing, is going to be a half victory at best. If we achieve energy inde-
pendence  by  a  strategy  that  relies  on  coal  to  liquids  that  doesn’t
actually  help,  and  maybe  moves  us  backwards  on  global  warming,
that is not a victory. If we achieve energy independence by pushing
and pushing and pushing on corn, but we don’t get to the cellulosic,
we don’t advance the sugar, we don’t move forward on vehicle effi-
ciency,  we  don’t  move  forward  on  transit,  on  smart  growth  and  so
on, we won’t actually achieve those goals.

So, I think we, as a country, have to look at this much more syn-

ergistically, and that is part of the lesson two.

THE ETHANOL MARKET IN THE U.S.

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  Congressman,  if  I  may,  real  quick,  not  on  the
environmental  issue,  but  Mr.  Kassel  raised  a  good  point  about  the
cost comparison between E–85 and other products in Brazil. Let us
talk  about  the  United  States  for  a  minute.  The  typical  American
consumer  reports  that  for  one  penny  a  gallon,  they  will  turn  left
across a busy street, just to save a penny a gallon. They will drive
five  miles,  five  minutes  out  of  their  way  to  save  a  penny  a  gallon.
When  talking  to  E–85  retailers,  they  tell  me  that  when  E–85  is
priced  $0.20  below  gasoline,  they  sell  quite  a  bit.  One  individual
told me at two locations, they were selling 12,000 gallons a month.
When  E–85  increased,  and  became  on  par  with  gasoline,  his  sales
dropped  to  500  gallons  a  month.  That  is  a  97  percent  reduction
based upon price. Consumers want to be green, but as I have been
telling  people  for  a  long  time,  the  green  in  their  wallets  are  really
what  is  driving  this,  and  I  caution  Congress,  as  you  look  at  alter-
native  fuels  and  renewable  fuels,  think  about  the  ultimate  cost  to
the consumer.

Moving to a new generation makes a lot of sense for a lot of rea-
sons,  but  keep  in  mind,  you  all  receive  a  lot  of  letters  and  calls
from  your  constituents  when  gas  prices  go  up.  Keep  that  in  mind
as you start thinking about alternative fuel programs.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much. Votes on the current
suspension  had  40  minutes  of  debate,  but  it  is  going  to—it  started
at 3:00, so we should have votes called at about 3:40. We have two
more presenters I will call first on. Mr. Lipinski from Indiana—Illi-
nois—I will get it out.

Mr. LIPINSKI. One of those corn states out there in the Midwest.
We have a lot of corn in Illinois, yet in Chicago, I drive around and
see  very,  very  few  stations  that  have  E–85.  Why  is  it?  Is  it  lack
of  supply  of  ethanol,  or  there  are  other  reasons?  Mr.  Eichberger,  I
think—we  have—I  have  seen  you  before  at  the  Small  Business
Committee, so Mr. Eichberger, what——

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  There  are  several  reasons,  Congressman.  And
Illinois, supply is probably not the driving force. You have a situa-
tion  where  what  is—each  retailer  has  to  ask  themselves  what  is
the level of demand, in terms of how many flexible fuel vehicles are
in  my  market,  and  how  many  of  those  drivers  really  want  to  buy
E–85? Do my customers want to buy this product?

If  they  do,  then  it  is  a  question  is  what  is  the  cost  of  putting  in
E–85.  In  my  testimony,  I  commented  that  the  cost  can  range  from
pretty  simple,  if  all  your  equipment  is  certified  as  compatible  with
the  fuel,  to  pretty  expensive  if  it  is  not.  So,  you  need  to  make  a
decision on your investment of capital.

Second, you need to think about this. If you have four dispensers,
and  you  take  one  of  them  out  of  service  and  put  in  E–85  in,  now,
you only have three gasoline dispensers. Will you continue to have
as much customer traffic coming in to fill up if there are three dis-
pensers  and  one  E–85,  as  you  did  when  you  were  selling  nothing
but  gasoline,  in  order  to  get  customers  in  your  store  to  buy  coffee,

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

42

doughnuts, or as Mr. Dinneen likes to say, beef jerky, because that
is where retailers really make their profit.

The  fuel  is  an  attraction.  That  is  what  generates  traffic  to  your
store. So, all of those things combine. In Illinois, supply is probably
not  going  to  be  an  issue.  I  bet  money  that  is  not  going  to  be  your
number one issue. The issue is going to be what is my competitive
angle if I do this. Can I sell it at a competitive price? Will my cus-
tomers continue to come, and will I continue to generate the bottom
line sales I need to to stay in my business?

If  all  the  economics  add  up,  and  I  can  afford  the  investment  to
bring E–85 into my station, chances are, I will make that decision.
But  we  are  still  at  pre-infancy  in  terms  of  demand  for  E–85,  and
that  is  really  what  is  kind  of  dragging  the  heels  of  the  industry.
Mr.  DINNEEN.  Congressman,  if  I  might,  there  are  three  things
that need to happen for the E–85 market to become a more mean-
ingful  component  of  our  business.  Last  year,  we  produced  five  bil-
lion  gallons  of  fuel  ethanol,  50  million  gallons  were  sold  as  E–85,
a fraction of a fraction, because ethanol today is a blend component
with  gasoline,  and  refiners  have  recognized  that  it  has  value  in
that market.

To  be  a  meaningful  part  of  an  alternative  fuel  market  for  E–85,
you  need  more  vehicles.  There  are  six  million,  or  five  million  vehi-
cles  on  the  road  today  capable  of  running  on  E–85.  That  is  a  big
number,  no  question.  But  it  is  still  less  than  three  percent  of  the
total vehicle car park in this country. And to convince John’s mem-
bers,  Mr.  Eichberger’s  members  to  put  in  the  infrastructure  nec-
essary  to  refuel  that,  when  you  are  telling  them  it  is  less  than
three  percent  of  his  potential  consumers,  and  only  a  fraction  of
those realize that they have the vehicles, it is awfully hard.

With  more  vehicles,  and  with  the  commitment  of  Ford  and  Gen-
eral Motors and Chrysler to dramatically increase their flexible fuel
production,  I  think  that  there  will  be  more  vehicles  coming,  and
over time, a more meaningful market will develop.

The second thing you need is a wider infrastructure. I do believe
that the infrastructure will follow the marketplace. There are 1,000
stations  out  there  today,  and  that  is  a  good  one.  We  ought  to  con-
centrate those stations where there is going to be a significant mar-
ket, and where we can build the E–85 market significantly. In Min-
nesota, there are about 500 E–85 stations, and it is the most mean-
ingful E–85 market in the entire country.

But  the  third  thing  that  you  also  need,  you  need  more  ethanol.
And you can’t get to a meaningful E–85 market with grain-derived
ethanol.  You  have  got  to  have  cellulosic  ethanol,  so  that  you  can
be talking about the kind of volumes that could actually satisfy the
demand  for  ethanol  coming  from  20  or  30  or  40  million  vehicles
that could be on the road in five or ten years. So, I mean, you need
all three of those.

I  might  also  add,  however,  that  the  E–85  technology  that  is  out
there today is not really taking advantage of the properties of eth-
anol.  There  is  a  mileage  penalty.  That  impacts  the  economics  that
Mr. Eichberger’s members are so concerned with.

Mr. LIPINSKI. What is the mileage penalty? Numbers——
Mr. DINNEEN. About 20 or 25 percent. I mean, it is certainly sig-
nificant.  And  with  the  technology  that  the  automakers  are  using

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

43

today, you are always going to have that. But there are, on the ho-
rizon, some technology. General Motors has the Saab 9–5, that has
a  turbocharged  engine,  that  realizes  no  mileage  penalty  when  eth-
anol  is  used.  And  that  would  dramatically  improve  the  economics.
So  one  of  the  things  that  we  would  like  to  see  is  that  the  flexible
fuel  technology  that  you  are  incentivizing  auto  manufacturers,  to
optimize  the  vehicle  to  look  at  fuel  performance  and  fuel  economy
issues.  Because  it  impacts,  ultimately,  the  economics  of  the  fuel
that will build the bigger market.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. I thank the gentleman. Now, we will call on
the former Chairman of this committee, Judy Biggert from Indiana.
Illinois, I am sorry. I did that again.

CELLULOSIC ETHANOL R&D

Ms.  BIGGERT.  I  think  it  is  looks  like  it  is  going  to  fade.  Thank

you very much, Mr. Chairman.

My  first  question  is  for  Mr.  Dinneen.  You  said  that  all  of  your
member  companies  are  doing  some  degree  of  research  on  cellulosic
ethanol,  materials  to  make  that.  Can  you  tell  us  a  little  bit  about
their research efforts?

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Sure.  I  don’t  think—any  of  this  is  not  public
knowledge,  but  a  company  in  your  state,  Archer-Daniels-Midland,
is  looking  at  producing  ethanol  from  fiber  that  is  already  coming
into the plant, and they believe that if they are able to convert that
fiber, which is a cellulosic material, they could increase their yields
by  15  percent.  Another  one  of  my  member  companies,  the  Broin
Companies,  has  announced  that  they  are  going  to  build  a  facility
in  Emmetsburg,  Iowa  that  will  produce  ethanol  from  corn  stover.
There is another ethanol company I represent, Abengoa, they have
got plants in Nebraska and New Mexico and Kansas, and they are
building  a  pilot  plant  in  Europe  today  to  produce  ethanol  from
wheat  straw  and  grain.  So,  I  mean  there  are  a  number  of  compa-
nies.  There  is  a  company,  Iogen,  a  Canadian  firm,  looking  to
produce  ethanol  from  wheat  straw.  There  is  a  California  company,
BlueFire,  that  is  looking  to  produce  ethanol  from  municipal  solid
waste in California. So, I mean, it is happening all across the coun-
try.  Just  popping  into  my  head,  New  York,  Northeast  Biofuels,  is
looking to produce ethanol from woody biomass.

The  future  of  ethanol  is  going  to  be  founded  on  grain,  because
it is been building the industry, but the structure is going to be dif-
ferent technologies, different feedstocks, and it is a very exciting fu-
ture.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  The—so  much  of  what  has  been  talked  about  is
sugar  cane,  which  I  thought  was  really  difficult—would  be  for  the
United States, because we don’t have the soil to grow it. So that—
are there other—are there greater promise for some of these others,
that—over other ones, or is that still in the research effort?

Mr. DINNEEN. It takes 13 pounds of sugar to produce a gallon of
ethanol, and at the U.S. sugar price of $0.22 a pound, the econom-
ics of that just aren’t very attractive.

But  there  are  opportunities  with  sugar  processing,  because  you
have  byproducts  from  the  sugar  process  that—the  gas,  that  could

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 17:15 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 032612 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\013007\32612 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

44

also  be  utilized  in  the  processing  of  ethanol,  and  there  is  actually
a company in Hawaii that is looking to do just that.

Ms. BIGGERT. I see.
Mr. DINNEEN. So, you may have some synergistic——
Ms. BIGGERT. It is the one place that it seems to grow.
Mr.  DINNEEN.  Potentially,  yeah.  But  for  the  most  part,  the  cli-

mate in this country isn’t that conducive to sugar.

Ms. BIGGERT. Are federal cellulosic research efforts helpful to the

companies that are doing this?

Mr. DINNEEN. Yes, if they are indeed, you know, fully funded.
Ms. BIGGERT. Yeah. I think—are the member companies working

with DOE?

Mr. DINNEEN. Department of Energy and the Department of Ag-
riculture have been terrific in working with the industry on a vari-
ety of cellulosic research programs.

Ms. BIGGERT. Does the cellulosic ethanol or materials have—cre-
ate the same ethanol as from corn. I mean, once it gets to be that,
it doesn’t——

Mr. DINNEEN. At the end of the day, as Mr. Eichberger said, eth-

anol is ethanol is ethanol.

produce than from corn?

Ms. BIGGERT. Okay. Does cellulosic ethanol require less water to

Mr.  DINNEEN.  I  am  not  sure  anybody  knows  yet,  because  the

technology is varied, and is yet not proven.
Ms. BIGGERT. Would that be important?
Mr. DINNEEN. Oh, sure. Absolutely. All these resource issues are
important. And not just for the cellulosic industry. I mean, the ex-
isting grain ethanol industry is always looking for process improve-
ments  to  reduce  not  just  energy  inputs,  but  water  inputs  as  well.

ETHANOL FUEL AVAILABILITY

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, also coming from Illinois, and I don’t see too
many stations in the metropolitan Chicago area, but there certainly
are  in  southern  Illinois,  where  it  seems  to  be  used  quite  a  bit,
but—question for Mr. Eichberger, another factor I would think that
affects  the  availability  of  fuels  like  E–85  is  because  most  all  of
the—most petroleum distributors don’t want to put E–85 in—under
their canopy because, first of all, their suppliers don’t make it, and
won’t guarantee it. Do you think that is a factor?

Mr.  EICHBERGER.  That  is  an  issue.  Think  about  this.  If  you  sign
a  contract,  and  keep  in  mind,  95  percent  of  all  retail  locations  are
independently  owned  and  operated,  not  affiliated  with  the  refining
company.  If  you  sign  a  contract  with  a  supplier  to  sell  their  brand
and  they  put  their  canopies  up,  you  have  to  honor  that  brand.  It
is  just  like  if  you  are  a  fast  food  restaurant  and  sign  a  contract
with Coke. You can’t sell Pepsi through a Coke dispenser, so you—
a lot of retailers can go to a supplier, and get special consideration
to  put  in  an  E–85  dispenser,  but  really,  the  primary  factor  that
comes into a retailer’s decision is what will it do to my bottom line?
Take into consideration my costs of investment, take into consider-
ation what is it going to do to my customer traffic?

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, how do we overcome this factor, then?
Mr. EICHBERGER. The marketplace factor?

45

Ms. BIGGERT. Well, I—no, I think with the distributors not want-
ing  to  put  it  under  the  canopy  in  the  first  place.  Are  we  going  to
have  to  create  a  whole  new  distributor  of  E–85,  or  a  new  gas  sta-
tion, or ethanol station, or whatever?

Mr. EICHBERGER. No, I don’t think there are very many retailers
out  there  who  have  actually  been  told  absolutely  no  by  their  sup-
plier.  If  they  want  to  put  in  E–85,  they  can  talk  to  their  supplier,
and  possibly  renegotiate  the  contract  to  allow  it  to  happen.  And
that is the reason there are 1,000 retailers out there that have E–
85. They are either privately branded, or they are branded with the
supplier,  but  there  is  some  room  to  work  with  their  supplier  to  do
this,  but  you  have  to  talk  to  them.  If  you  have  a  contract  to  sell
their brand of product, and in order to get out of that contract, you
need to renegotiate the terms of that contract.

Ms. BIGGERT. Which I think might be a factor that makes it dif-
ficult, and why we are not seeing more of them, but thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I yield back.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  You  are  welcome.  Thank  you  very  much.
Before  you  go,  Mr.  Bartlett,  let  me—I  am  going  to  give  each—the
privilege  of  the  Chair  is  going  to  give  each—Mr.  Bartlett  and  Mr.
McNerney one minute to wrap this thing up, and if you all will for-
give  me  for  doing  a  second  round  today,  but  I  think  we  are  going
to have opportunity.

Let me let Mr. McNerney go first.

MORE ON CELLULOSIC ETHANOL R&D

Mr.  MCNERNEY.  Thanks  for  your  indulgence,  Mr.  Chair,  and

Ranking Member.

During the State of the Union, the President sort of held out for
a  long-term  hope,  and  I  want  to  be  a  part  of  that  hope,  but  the
promise of cellulosic ethanol looks to me like something that we are
not really that close to yet, and what I am hoping is that H.R. 547
will help us get there.

Now, in your opinion, how far does this get us? I mean, is it true
that in cellulosic ethanol, you need specific technology for each kind
of  crop,  or—I  mean,  there  is  a  lot  of  questions  in  my  mind  about
how viable this is, in sort of a ten year timeframe, or are we actu-
ally closer than I am afraid that we are not?

Mr. DINNEEN. Congressman, I think we are a lot closer to having
cellulosic  ethanol  commercialized  than  anybody  realizes,  and  it
may be a variety of technologies. I mean, you could have enzymatic
conversion  of  biomass.  You  could  have  acid  hydrolysis.  You  could
have gasification. Those are essentially the three different types of
technologies,  and  there  are  a  number  of  companies  looking  at  all
three  with  different  approaches,  and  we  don’t  know  who  is  going
to be the first to crack the code, but it is inconceivable to me, with
the amount of government and private effort that is going into this
that it will not happen very soon.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Dinneen.  Mr.  Bartlett.  Dr.

Bartlett.

MORE ETHANOL SOURCE CONCERNS

Mr.  BARTLETT.  Thank  you  very  much.  Fifty  years  ago  this  year,
Hyman Rickover gave a very interesting talk, I think in Minnesota,
to  a  group  of  physicians.  I  think  there  is  a  link  on  our  website  to
that. In there, he made two cautions.

One  was  when  you  are  going  to  the  bio-world  to  get  fuels,  and
he predicted we would be here today, by the way, you are going to
the  bio-world  to  get  fuels,  note  that  you  are  going  to  be  competing
with  either  food—we  are  already  doing  that  with  corn,  the  price
has  doubled,  because  we  are  competing  with  animal  food.  Or  for
the  cellulosic  ethanol,  you  are  going  to  be  competing  with  the  re-
quirement  to  return  organic  material  to  soils.  Our  topsoils  are
today not increasing in quantity and quality, so I am having a little
trouble  understanding  how  we  are  going  to  rob  our  topsoils  of  all
of this enormous amount of biomass to make cellulosic ethanol.

We will get some, sir, from things that end up in the landfill, but
be  very  careful  that  you  are  not  mining  our  topsoils,  and  pulling
off  of  them—corn  stover,  I  notice  you  mentioned,  you  know,  that
now  generally  is  returned  to  the  soils  to  keep  erosion  down  next
year, and to provide till thin soils, which holds moisture and holds
nutrients  for  the  plant.  We  are  going  to  get  something  from  cel-
lulosic ethanol, but nothing near what most exponents of this indi-
cate we will get.

Mr.  DINNEEN.  Congressman,  those  are  certainly  issues  that  we
are  indeed  looking  at.  Those  people  that  have  talked  about  corn
stover,  for  example,  aren’t  talking  about  taking  the  entire  plant.
They  are  talking  about  taking  a  third  of  the  stover,  and  returning
the rest of it to the soil. Farmers need that material for the nutri-
ents  that  it  provides,  and  they  are  not  going  to  kill  the  golden
goose. So, the industry is very, very interested in those issues. And
some  of  the  cellulosic  material  that  could  ultimately  be  converted
would be municipal solid waste. So, I mean there are opportunities,
and  the  marketplace  will  ultimately  determine  what  makes  the
most  sense,  but  I  believe  that  ethanol  is  not  the  total  answer,  but
it is a part of the answer.

Chairman LAMPSON. Well, I want to thank all of you for appear-

ing before this subcommittee this afternoon.

Based  upon  the  testimony  of  this  hearing,  and  the  letters  of  en-
dorsement  for  this  legislation,  I  believe  that  our  subcommittee  is
comfortable  with  this  legislation  moving  to  consideration  by  Full
Committee tomorrow morning.

I  understand  the  bill  is  likely  to  be  scheduled  for  consideration

by the House during the week of February 5 under a rule.

So, at this time, I would also ask unanimous consent to have let-
ters of endorsement and other extraneous materials related to H.R.
547 included in the record. [The information appears in the Appen-
dix.]

Chairman LAMPSON. Without objection, so ordered.
This hearing is adjourned. Thank you all very much.
[Whereupon, at 3:36 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
