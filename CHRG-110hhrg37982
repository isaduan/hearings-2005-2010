U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Revisiting the Industrial

Technologies Program (ITP):

Achieving Industrial Efficiency

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2007

2:00 P.M.–4:00 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On September 25, 2007, the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment will hold
a  hearing  on  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  Industrial  Technologies  Program
(ITP), and prospects for improving the energy efficiency and environmental perform-
ance  of  the  country’s  most  energy-intensive  manufacturing  processes  through  tech-
nological  advancement  and  industrial  process  assessments.  The  hearing  shall  pro-
vide  background  for  legislation  in  this  area.  A  copy  of  the  discussion  draft  and  sec-
tion by section is attached.

The  hearing  will  examine  the  successes  and  limitations  of  the  Industrial  Tech-
nologies  Program,  and  how  the  program  can  be  improved  to  increase  industrial  en-
ergy  efficiency  and  environmental  performance  in  the  U.S.  industrial  sector.  It  will
also  look  at  which  areas  of  research  and  development  should  be  enhanced  and  ex-
plored  by  the  ITP  and  the  Industrial  Assessment  Centers,  and  what  cost-effective
opportunities does a further enhancement of industrial efficiency program offer.

The  Subcommittee  will  hear  testimony  from  four  witnesses  offering  perspectives
from the U.S. industrial sector, industry trade associations, and university-based en-
ergy  auditing  centers.  The  witnesses  will  also  comment  on  the  need  and  timeliness
of  this  legislation,  and  make  recommendations  for  improving  the  legislative  lan-
guage.

Background

4

An  expanding  economy,  growing  population,  and  rising  standard  of  living  create
rapidly  growing  demands  for  energy,  making  energy  conservation  a  key  national
goal.  In  the  U.S.  industry  is  responsible  for  more  than  one-third  of  all  energy  con-
sumed,  the  large  majority  of  which  is  consumed  by  certain  heavy  industries  such
as chemical, glass and metals production, mining, petroleum refining, and forest and
paper  products.  These  industries  require  very  large  amounts  of  energy  per  unit  of
production,  making  them  particularly  susceptible  to  high  energy  prices.  These  and
other energy-intensive industries are ideal candidates on which to focus energy effi-
ciency  efforts  and  apply  new  technologies  that  not  only  increase  efficiency,  but  also
raise productivity, reduce wastes, and trim costs.

While the U.S. industrial sector has become much more efficient over the past 30
years,  there  are  still  ample  opportunities  to  achieve  efficiency  gains.  However,  en-
ergy-intensive industries face enormous competitive pressures that make it difficult
to  make  the  necessary  R&D  investments  in  technology  development.  Energy-inten-
sive  industries  tend  to  exhibit  relatively  low  levels  of  R&D  spending,  and  are  often
unwilling  to  accept  the  risks  associated  with  undertaking  complex  capital-intensive
technology  development  and  implementation.  Without  a  sustained  commitment  by
the  private  and  public  sectors  to  invest  in  technology  R&D  and  adopt  new  tech-
nologies,  the  ability  to  close  the  gap  between  U.S.  energy  supply  and  demand  will
be greatly limited.

The Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) works to improve the energy intensity
of  U.S.  industry  through  coordinated  research  and  development  and  dissemination
of  innovative  energy  efficiency  technologies  and  practices.  The  ITP  invests  in  high-
risk, high-value cost-shared R&D projects to reduce industrial energy use and proc-
ess waste streams, while stimulating productivity and growth. Competitive solicita-
tions are the principal mechanism used by ITP to contract for cost-shared R&D. So-
licitations  reflect  the  priorities  of  the  Program  and  selection  of  projects  follows
merit-based  criteria  that  emphasize  projected  energy,  environmental,  and  economic
benefits. In addition, ITP makes available information and resources on other finan-
cial  assistance  and  research  opportunities  and  case  studies  from  past  ITP  projects.
The  ITP  portfolio  details  over  1,000  technology  development  projects  in  which  ITP
has been involved.

The  Industrial  Technologies  Program  claims  numerous  successes.  ITP-sponsored
technologies  have  won  31  ‘‘R&D  100  Awards’’  between  1991  and  2005,  and  ITP-
sponsored  R&D  has  yielded  156  patents  since  1994.  While  DOE  R&D  has  yielded
many  energy  efficient  technologies  ready  for  market  entry,  the  ITP  in  particular  is
considered  one  of  the  most  effective  DOE  programs  at  transferring  technologies,
with  over  170  technologies  reaching  the  commercial  market.  An  estimated  13,000
U.S. manufacturing plants have been improved through the ITP technology delivery
effort.  Nearly  five  quadrillion  Btu  of  energy  (equal  to  approximately  $23  billion)  of
energy  savings  are  attributed  to  the  program  since  its  inception,  with  366  trillion
Btu saved in 2004 alone.

The ITP also sponsors 26 University-Based Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs)
that provide no-cost energy assessments primarily to small and medium-sized man-
ufacturers. Assessments are conducted by teams of faculty and students, and involve
examinations of potential savings from energy efficiency improvements, waste mini-
mization  and  pollution  prevention,  and  productivity  improvement.  The  average  ex-
pected savings per assessment are fifty to seventy thousand, with much larger sav-
ings  possible  with  large  operations.  Companies  are  in  turn  encouraged  to  replicate
accomplishments and share results.

By operating through university engineering programs the IACs serve as a train-
ing ground for the next-generation of energy and industrial engineers. Roughly 240
students  receiving  training  through  the  program  each  year.  When  budgets  for  the
program  were  higher  38  IACs  operated  around  the  country,  compared  to  the  26  in
operation  today.  The  approximately  $4  million  funding  for  IACs  is  relatively  small,
especially  given  the  significant  economic  benefits  of  reducing  industrial  energy  con-
sumption.
Brief Budget Overview

Constantly  changing  market  conditions,  energy  prices,  and  business  concerns  af-
fect the ability and willingness of industry to pursue energy efficiency opportunities.
As the role of energy in industry changes, the ITP should have the resources to sus-
tain and expand operations, adapt, and reshape its strategy where needed. However,
the budget in recent years has decreased dramatically. The Fiscal Year 2007 budget
request  for  Industrial  Technologies  was  $45.6  million,  an  $11.3  million  reduction
from the Fiscal Year 2006 Appropriation. By comparison, appropriated levels as re-

cently as Fiscal Year 2000 were as high as $175 million. These funding levels reflect
a dramatic shift in priorities away from industrial efficiency R&D.

Chairman LAMPSON. This hearing will come to order. Good after-
noon,  and  welcome  to  this  hearing  on  the  Department  of  Energy’s
Industrial  Technologies  Program,  the  discussion  draft  of  my  bill,
the Industrial Energy Efficiency Act of 2007.

I  want  to  thank  our  distinguished  panel,  all  of  you,  for  joining
us today. We look forward to hearing your perspectives about your
experiences  with  the  Industrial  Technologies  Program  as  we  seek
to highlight and enhance its important work.

The program carries out this mission through a coordinated pro-
gram  of  research  and  development  and  dissemination  of  tech-
nologies  and  operating  practices.  The  Industrial  Technology  Pro-
gram leads the Federal Government’s ongoing effort to improve en-
ergy  efficiency  and  environmental  performance  of  the  Nation’s  in-
dustrial sector in partnership with industry and universities. These
efforts not only improve the bottom line of a wide variety of indus-
tries but enhance the quality of life for American workers, families,
and communities that they serve.

Unfortunately,  we  have  seen  the  budget  for  this  program  drop
fairly rapidly in the last few years. The Administration’s fiscal year
2008 budget request for the program is a fraction of the fiscal year
2001 appropriation.

Today  our  witnesses  will  identify  opportunities  to  improve  this
important program. And my region of the country has a significant
stake  in  this  issue,  to  say  the  least.  Many  energy-intensive  indus-
tries,  especially  chemical  manufacturing  and  petroleum  refining
are  located  east  of  Highway  35  in  Texas.  That  is  a  big  area,  but
these industries face several challenges to their continued economic
strength,  and  many  other  businesses  in  my  area  depend  upon  the
health of these core industries.

There is significant pressure to reduce the emissions and energy
use associated with their processes, while keeping costs low enough
to  maintain  the  region’s  attractiveness  to  industry.  And  that  is  a
tall order when costs for natural gas, one of the primary industrial
feedstocks, are among the highest in the country.

Texas has the highest percentage of large energy-intensive indus-
tries, eight percent of the U.S. total. Texas consumes 20 percent of
the energy used by U.S. industry, and over half of the energy used
in Texas is consumed by the industrial sector.

It  is  said  that  the  cheapest  energy  is  the  energy  you  don’t  have
to use at all. With energy costs as high as they are, increasing effi-
ciency  through  technology  advancement  is  key  to  keeping  these
core industries located in the United States.

Clearly, increasing energy efficiency is in everyone’s interest and
the  Industrial  Technology  Program  is  an  important  avenue  for
achieving  this  important  economic,  national  security,  and  environ-
mental goals.

So  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  and  the  recommendations  of
our witnesses, and now I would like to recognize our distinguished
Ranking  Member,  Mr.  Inglis,  of  South  Carolina,  for  his  opening
statement.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN NICK LAMPSON

Good  afternoon.  Welcome  to  this  hearing  on  the  Department  of  Energy’s  Indus-
trial  Technologies  Program  and  the  discussion  draft  of  my  bill,  the  Industrial  En-
ergy Efficiency Act of 2007.

I  would  like  to  thank  our  distinguished  panel  of  witnesses  for  joining  us  today.
We  look  forward  to  hearing  your  perspectives  and  about  your  experiences  with  the
Industrial  Technology  Program  as  we  seek  to  highlight  and  enhance  its  important
work.

The  program  carries  out  this  mission  through  a  coordinated  program  of  research

and development, and dissemination of technologies and operating practices.

The  Industrial  Technology  Program  leads  the  Federal  Government’s  on-going  ef-
fort to improve energy efficiency and environmental performance of the Nation’s in-
dustrial sector in partnership with industry and universities. These efforts not only
improve  the  bottom-line  of  a  wide  variety  of  industries,  but  enhance  the  quality  of
life for American workers, families, and communities they serve.

Unfortunately, we have seen the budget for this program drop rapidly in the last
few  years.  The  Administration’s  FY  2008  budget  request  for  the  program  is  a  frac-
tion of the FY 2001 appropriation.

Today  our  witnesses  will  identify  opportunities  to  improve  this  important  pro-

gram. My region of the country has a significant stake in this issue.

Many  energy-intensive  industries,  most  especially  chemical  manufacturing  and
petroleum  refining,  are  located  east  of  Highway  35  in  Texas.  These  industries  face
several challenges to their continued economic strength, and many other businesses
in my area depend upon the health of these core industries.

There  is  significant  pressure  to  reduce  the  emissions  and  energy  use  associated
with  their  processes,  while  keeping  costs  low  enough  to  maintain  the  region’s
attractiveness to industry. That’s a tall order when costs for natural gas, one of the
primary industrial feedstocks, are among the highest in the country.

Texas  has  the  highest  percentage  of  large  energy-intensive  industries,  eight  per-
cent of the U.S. total. Texas consumes 20 percent of the energy used by U.S. indus-
try. Over half of the energy used in Texas is consumed by the industrial sector.

It is said that the cheapest energy is the energy you don’t have to use at all. With
energy  costs  as  high  as  they  are,  increasing  efficiency  through  technology  advance-
ment is key to keeping these core industries located in the U.S.

Clearly,  increasing  energy  efficiency  is  in  everyone’s  interest  and  the  Industrial
Technology Program is an important avenue for achieving this important economic,
national  security,  and  environmental  goal.  I  look  forward  to  the  testimony  and  rec-
ommendations of our witnesses.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  holding
this  hearing  to  discuss  the  importance  of  improving  industrial  en-
ergy efficiency.

Industry  as  I  understand  it  consumes  about  one-third  of  all  the
energy  used  in  the  United  States.  We  pump  more  energy  into  our
factories than we do into our vehicles. Increasing U.S. industrial ef-
ficiency  will  have  many  payoffs.  It  will  reduce  emissions,  drive
down  energy  costs,  enabling  domestic  companies  to  compete  inter-
nationally, and transfer energy cost savings to the consumer.

The  Department  of  Energy’s  Industrial  Technologies  Program
has  a  successful  track  record  of  helping  U.S.  manufacturers  trans-
late  research  and  development  into  efficient,  cost-saving  tech-
nologies.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  witnesses  today,  discussing,
in  discussing  ways  that  the  Industrial  Technologies  Program  can
further  enable  our  nation’s  industries  in  their  achievement  of  en-
ergy efficiency while remaining economically competitive.

Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

pump  more  energy  into  our  factories  than  we  do  into  our  vehicles.  Increasing  U.S.
industry  efficiency  will  have  many  payoffs:  reduce  emissions,  drive  down  energy
costs  enabling  domestic  companies  to  compete  internationally,  and  transfer  energy
cost savings to the consumer.

The Department of Energy’s Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) has a success-
ful  track  record  of  helping  U.S.  manufacturers  translate  research  and  development
into efficient, cost-saving technologies. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses
today,  and  discussing  ways  the  ITP  can  further  enable  our  nation’s  industries  to
achieve energy efficiency while remaining economically competitive.

Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Inglis.  And  I  ask  unani-
mous  consent  that  all  additional  opening  statements  submitted  by
Subcommittee  Members  be  included  in  the  record.  Without  objec-
tion, so ordered.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  calling  today’s  hearing  to  receive  testimony  on  the
Industrial  Technologies  Program  (ITP)  and  legislation  to  support  research  and  de-
velopment of new industrial processes and technologies.

The  Science  and  Technology  Committee  continues  to  examine  energy  reform,  the
globalization  of  science  technology,  and  the  competitiveness  of  our  universities  and
America’s overall economy. The ITP has a significant positive impact on these issues
by working with U.S. industry and our university students to improve industrial en-
ergy efficiency and environmental performance.

As  our  nation  continues  to  be  impacted  by  high  energy  costs  and  environmental
challenges, consumers and businesses are faced with few if any cost effective options
to  immediately  address  these  problems.  The  ITP  invests  in  high-risk  research  and
development  to  improve  industrial  energy  efficiency  while  stimulating  productivity
and growth. The ITP enjoys wide successes in R&D awards. Their research and de-
velopment  has  resulted  in  more  than  150  patents  with  over  170  technologies  that
have  reached  commercial  markets.  The  ITP  also  sponsors  26  university-based  as-
sessment  centers,  which  provide  energy  assessments  to  small  and  medium-sized
businesses.

Congress continues to focus on energy reform and ways to curtail our dependence
on  foreign  oil  while  maintaining  a  sound  environment  and  national  economy.  As  I
have said before, one way to accomplish this goal is through the use of coal-to-liquid
fuels.

The  United  States  has  an  abundant  supply  of  coal,  and  I  firmly  believe  coal-to-
liquids,  particularly  in  combination  with  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  and
other  technologies,  is  part  of  the  solution  to  achieving  U.S.  energy  independence,
continued economic prosperity and improved environmental stewardship.

Coal-to-liquids plants using CCS can produce fuels with life cycle greenhouse gas
emission profiles that are as good as or better than that of petroleum-derived prod-
ucts.

In  order  for  CCS  technology  to  become  commercially  viable,  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  must  show  it  is  committed  to  funding  the  necessary  research,  development,
and  demonstration  (RD&D)  projects.  Today,  we  are  taking  an  enormous  step  for-
ward  in  this  goal  as  we  examine  legislation  to  establish  a  program  in  cooperation
with  energy  industries  and  universities  to  conduct  research,  development,  dem-
onstration, and commercial applications.

Mr. Chairman, as you know, I have been a strong advocate for federal coal initia-
tives  and  programs.  I  intend  to  continue  to  work  with  my  colleagues  on  both  sides
of the aisle to ensure we continue to advance technologies, including clean coal tech-
nology,  to  overcome  the  technical  and  economical  challenges  for  coal-based  power
plants.  I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  the  witnesses  regarding  their  thoughts  on
these issues.

economy.

These actions will affect American students, U.S. competitiveness, and our overall

There  have  been  several  committee  hearings  in  the  House  and  Senate  to  discuss
CCS  technology.  I  am  glad  we  are  having  today’s  Subcommittee  hearing  because

tion the panel.

And Mr. Moore, we will begin with you.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  FREDERICK  L.  MOORE,  GLOBAL  DIREC-
TOR,  MANUFACTURING  AND  TECHNOLOGY,  DOW  CHEMICAL
COMPANY
Mr.  MOORE.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the
Subcommittee.  My  name  is  Fred  Moore,  and  I  am  the  Director  of
Manufacturing  and  Technology  for  Energy  with  the  Dow  Chemical
Company. In that capacity I am responsible for assuring that Dow’s
use of energy is as efficient as possible.

I am here today in my capacity as Chairman of the Energy Effi-
ciency  Task  Force  of  the  National  Association  of  Manufacturers
(NAM),  the  largest  industrial  trade  association  in  the  U.S.  NAM
represents  more  than  14  million  men  and  women  in  the  manufac-
turing  economy  producing  $1.5  trillion  in  revenues  last  year.  We

are  pleased  to  offer  our  views  on  DOE’s  ITP  Program  and  how  to
achieve greater industrial energy efficiency.

Energy efficiency is an imperative for the American manufactur-
ers,  as  well  as  every  other  sector  of  our  economy.  NAM  affirmed
the importance of energy efficiency with the release of its competi-
tiveness  model  energy  legislation  earlier  this  year.  As  a  nation  we
must  begin  to  think  of  the  energy  we  don’t  use  as  our  first  fuel  of
choice.

Natural  gas  prices  differ  widely  around  the  world  from  75  cents
per million BTUs in the Middle East to the winter forecast for the
U.S. of $9 per million BTUs. Our inability to pass on these energy
costs  in  the  price  of  our  products  results  in  manufacturing  being
the shock absorber for high and volatile fuel prices.

We  are  the  leading  edge  of  demand  destruction  in  the  face  of
high energy prices. The demand destruction is just a stare-all term
for  job  loss.  Nearly  three  million  high-paying  manufacturing  jobs
have been lost since the run-up in natural gas prices in 2000.

What  are  we  doing  about  this?  In  Dow  we  are  relentless  in  our
drive  to  reduce  the  amount  of  energy  it  takes  to  produce  each
pound  of  product.  Between  1995,  and  2005,  we  improved  our  en-
ergy efficiency by 22 percent, saving nearly 900 trillion BTUs. That
is enough energy to power all the residential and commercial busi-
nesses  in  California  for  an  entire  year.  And  we  saved  nearly  $4.5
billion in the process.

Dow is committed to achieve another 25 percent improvement in
energy  efficiency  by  2015.  To  underscore  the  impact  of  energy  effi-
ciency on our nation’s energy security, if our entire economy in the
U.S.  would  achieve  a  similar  goal,  assuming  normal  GDP  growth,
we  could  displace  the  oil  equivalent  of  all  of  our  current  imports
from the Persian Gulf.

We have learned much from our work with DOE’s ITP Program.
In  addition  to  being  an  active  participant  in  their  Save  Energy
Now  Program,  we  hosted  13  DOE  energy  assessments  at  our  nine
largest  sites  in  the  U.S.  in  the  last  two  years.  These  joint  assess-
ments identified nearly four trillion BTUs per year of savings, with
an annual amount of roughly $30 million.

In fact, just last week the Department of Energy helped us opti-
mize one of our pumping systems at our Texas City Plant in Texas.
That literally allowed us to begin saving $200,000 a year in energy
costs that day. It was almost as easy as flipping a switch.

If ITP can identify additional opportunities for us, imagine what
it  can  do  for  the  thousands  of  small  and  medium-sized  companies
that  have  neither  the  internal  expertise  nor  the  resources  of  Dow.
That is why NAM and the DOE recently signed a Memorandum of
Understanding  (MOU)  to  work  together  to  promote  energy  effi-
ciency  among  its  12,000-member  companies.  It  is  our  joint  respon-
sibility  to  help  them.  In  order  to  succeed,  we  need  a  strong  ITP
Program, because it brings together the collective expertise of busi-
ness,  of  government,  and  others  such  as  NAM  to  multiply  its  im-
pact.

You  have  asked  how  to  strengthen  the  program.  Please  consider
the  following  suggestions.  It  should  expand  to  focus  on  co-genera-
tion, combined heat and power, and waste heat recovery. It should
increase  its  dialogue  in  involvement  with  a  manufacturing  com-

pany  representatives  to  insure  that  the  activities  meet  the  needs
of the manufacturing sector.

Funding  should  be  restored  to  late  1990  levels  to  allow  re-staff-
ing of the program. Programs that reach out to small and medium
manufacturers  should  be  coordinated  with  other  governmental  ac-
tivities  to  minimize  redundancy  and  maximize  synergy.  And  last,
there should be close coordination with EPA’s Energy Star Program
to make best use of their tools.

Energy  efficiency  has  for  too  long  been  the  Rodney  Dangerfield
of  energy  policy.  It  gets  no  respect.  Through  our  collective  efforts
we  can  assure  that  energy  efficiency  gets  the  respect  it  deserves.

Thank you, and I look forward to answering any questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Moore follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF FREDERICK L. MOORE

The  Dow  Chemical  Company,  on  behalf  of  the  National  Association  of  Manufac-
turers  (NAM),  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  submit  these  written  comments  con-
cerning the Department of Energy (DOE) Industrial Technology Program (ITP).

High U.S. energy prices have spurred a significant amount of private sector action
on  energy  efficiency.  Many  companies,  for  example,  have  established  energy  effi-
ciency programs. In our experience, in order to be successful, a corporate energy effi-
ciency  program  requires  top-level  commitment;  an  integrated  approach;  and  a  con-
tinuous effort to identify, evaluate, and prioritize among energy efficiency opportuni-
ties. To help companies achieve energy efficiency improvements, several third-party
initiatives  are  underway,  including  the  recent  creation  of  the  NAM  Energy  Effi-
ciency Task Force.

The  country  currently  faces  significant  energy  challenges  in  the  form  of  energy
security and climate change. Given these dual and interrelated problems, promotion
of energy efficiency represents the consensus first step toward a comprehensive pol-
icy  solution.  However,  a  sole  reliance  on  private  sector  action  is  not  going  to  solve
the  inter-linked  problems  of  energy  security  and  global  climate  change.  A  partner-
ship between the private and public sectors will be required to promote energy effi-
ciency,  the  development  of  renewable  and  alternative  energy,  and  the  development
and  deployment  of  energy-saving  technologies.  The  DOE  ITP  program  represents
the  kind  of  government  program  that  is  necessary  to  help  US  manufacturers  iden-
tify  opportunities  for  energy  savings  through  efficiency.  We  believe  this  very  valu-
able  program  should  be  strengthened  in  order  to  promote  energy  efficiency  across
the manufacturing sector.
The Dow Chemical Company

Dow was founded in Michigan in 1897 and is one of the world’s leading manufac-
turers  of  chemicals  and  plastics.  We  supply  more  than  3,300  products  to  customers
in  175  countries  around  the  world,  including  hundreds  of  specialty  chemicals,  plas-
tics, crop protection products, and pharmaceutical raw materials essential to life.

Dow is an energy-intensive company. Dow uses energy, primarily natural gas liq-
uids, as a feedstock to make our products. We also use energy to drive the chemical
reactions  necessary  to  turn  our  feedstock  materials  into  useful  products,  many  of
which lead to net energy savings.

Dow  is  committed  to  sustainability.  Our  ambitious  2015  sustainability  goals  un-
derscore this commitment to reduce our energy and climate ‘‘footprint,’’ and to assist
other manufacturers and the public to do likewise.

Dow  has  invested  in  a  comprehensive  energy  efficiency  program,  and  we  have
achieved  impressive  results.  Between  1995  and  2005,  we  reduced  our  energy  inten-
sity  (i.e.,  energy  use  divided  by  production  output)  by  22  percent.  We  are  not  stop-
ping  there.  We  have  committed  to  reduce  our  energy  intensity  by  an  additional  25
percent  from  2005  to  2015.  Such  an  improvement,  if  replicated  across  the  country,
would be extremely beneficial.

For example, if the U.S. reduced its energy intensity by 25 percent between 2005
and  2015,  and  assuming  GDP  grows  at  the  expected  three  percent  rate,  we  would
eliminate the oil equivalent of all the Persian Gulf imports today.

Our  financial  investment  in  energy  efficiency  has  been  rewarded  several  times
over  in  terms  of  energy  savings.  We  believe  our  experience  with  energy  efficiency
can serve as an example for other companies and the general public.

Aside  from  financial  rewards,  our  energy  efficiency  program  has  also  helped  re-
duce  our  absolute  levels  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  and  we  are  committed  to  do
even  better  in  the  future.  Our  aggressive  focus  on  energy  intensity  has  contributed
to,  since  1990,  a  reduction  of  over  20  percent  in  absolute  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions—below the reduction target set in the Kyoto Protocol.
Energy Efficiency at Dow

Dow  is  using  its  expertise  to  minimize  its  energy  and  climate  ‘‘footprint’’  and  to

develop products that enable its downstream customers to do likewise.

The  Dow  Chemical  Company  is  a  recognized  industry  leader  in  energy  manage-
ment.  Energy  efficiency  has  been  part  of  our  heritage  since  the  very  early  years  of
our  company,  when  Dow  helped  pioneer  the  use  of  industrial  combined  heat  and
power, also known as co-generation. In conventional power plants, a significant por-
tion of the energy is lost (usually through cooling towers or flue gas) in the process
of  electricity  generation.  In  contrast,  co-generation  captures  more  of  the  heat,  uti-
lizing less fuel, which has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions and im-
proved  air  quality  relative  to  conventional  utility  power.  Co-generation  typically
uses  20  to  40  percent  less  fuel  than  separate  steam  and  power  generation  because
energy is captured and used that would otherwise be wasted.

In recent years, through a company-wide focus on energy efficiency, we have dra-
matically reduced our energy intensity—and exceeded an aggressive, long-term cor-
porate  energy  efficiency  goal  mentioned  previously.  Figure  1  shows  how  our  $1  bil-
lion investment in energy efficiency has returned around $4.5 billion in energy sav-
ings.

Dow’s  experience  in  energy  efficiency  has  convinced  us  that  we  can  help  others
realize these benefits, too. Indeed, energy efficiency is a universal tool. It should be
the tool of choice, irrespective of whether one’s motivation is to save money, reduce
GHG emissions, or reduce dependence on foreign energy. It is the cheapest and most
renewable ‘‘fuel’’ of all.

Dow’s  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  initiative  relies  strongly  on  our  struc-
tured approach to resource conservation and energy intensity reduction. At the core
is the sustained commitment and support of Dow’s corporate leadership. The overall
Energy Efficiency and Conservation effort within Dow is driven by a Global Energy
Efficiency  Leader,  who  has  full  responsibility  and  accountability  for  implementing
and managing an aggressive global energy conservation plan. The energy conserva-

tion  leader  sponsors  technology  center  and  site  energy  efficiency  teams  and  net-
works  throughout  the  company  to  identify  energy  saving  opportunities,  develop
long-term energy improvement plans, and implement projects.

In  addition,  each  business  unit  at  Dow  is  responsible  for  aligning  its  goals  and
plans  to  the  corporate  goal  on  energy  efficiency.  Focal  points  within  each  business
unit  are  responsible  for  driving  energy  efficiency  within  their  respective  tech-
nologies. Energy efficiency is further driven by the energy conservation teams at our
13  largest  energy-consuming  sites,  which  account  for  over  90  percent  of  Dow’s  en-
ergy  usage.  These  local  teams  actively  engage  employees  in  energy  efficiency  im-
provement projects at their sites and drive an energy efficiency mindset and culture
at the local level.
The ITP: Promoting Energy Efficiency

Outside of Dow, the company also partners with, and/or supports, government and
other  organizations  in  their  efforts  to  promote  energy  efficiency  among  all  con-
sumers. Dow is an active participant in the U.S. Department of Energy’s ‘‘Save En-
ergy Now’’ industrial energy efficiency campaign. Save Energy Now is sponsored by
the  DOE  Industrial  Technology  Program.  Dow  was  one  of  the  first  six  companies
selected  for  a  DOE  Energy  Savings  Assessment  (ESA)  because  of  its  interest  and
past success in setting an example in energy management.

In  the  past  two  years,  the  company  has  hosted  thirteen  energy  assessments  at
nine  of  its  largest  U.S.  manufacturing  facilities.  These  assessments  have  included
steam,  process  heating,  and  pumping  systems.  These  joint  assessments  identified
additional energy saving opportunities:

3.75 trillion Btu per year, valued at more than $30 million per year.

• The  total  energy  savings  potential  found  in  the  assessments  was  more  than
• At the end of August, seven of the plants have reported implementing energy

done.

Further, Dow collaborated with the DOE to pilot conducting a series of Industrial
Best  Practices  training  sessions  via  webcast,  also  well  as  hosting,  in-depth  DOE
Steam  Systems  Assessment  training  sessions  in  Texas  and  Louisiana,  drawing  not
only  Dow  engineers  but  also  surrounding  industrial  community  members,  enabling
other  companies  to  benefit  from  energy  saving  assessment  tools  and  strategies.  We
are continuing that collaboration on other projects, such as the Superior Energy Per-
formance Partnership, whose purpose is to develop a more consistent framework for
achieving greater energy efficiency in all U.S. manufacturing plants. The goal of the
Partnership  is  to  reduce,  by  25  percent,  the  energy  intensity  of  U.S.  industry  over
the next ten years. Meeting this goal would save 8.4 quadrillion Btu per year, which
is equal to the annual energy consumption of the State of California.

It is useful to provide an illustration of the value of the ITP. Last December, one
of  Dow’s  combined  heat  and  power  (CHP)  units,  known  as  Power  6,  participated  in
the Energy Savings Assessment sponsored by the Department of Energy’s ‘‘Save En-
ergy  Now’’  program.  The  three-day  activity  was  facilitated  by  an  expert  consultant,
and focused on steam system optimization and energy conservation. The assessment
yielded a list of opportunities that were evaluated by the Operations and Technology
Center teams.

Several  of  the  opportunities  were  implemented  and  led  to  significant  energy  sav-
ings.  DOE  is  launching  a  recognition  program  to  reward  plants  who  have  imple-
mented  significant  savings  through  the  energy  assessment.  Power  6  has  achieved
the  highest  award  level—Energy  Champion—by  saving  over  250,000  million  Btu
and/or over 15 percent total energy savings.

If a company like Dow, that has a successful track record in energy efficiency, can
benefit so much from the ITP program, then what about the thousands of small and
medium-size  companies  that  have  neither  the  internal  expertise  nor  the  resources?
This is where the unique collaboration between the National Association of Manu-
facturers  (NAM),  government,  and  other  organizations  can  help  take  industrial  en-
ergy efficiency to the next level. The U.S. industrial sector is responsible for 33 per-
cent  of  total  U.S.  energy  consumption.  The  opportunities  for  energy  efficiency  are
enormous.

The  NAM  is  the  largest  industrial  trade  association  in  the  United  States.  The
NAM represents the more than 14 million men and women employed in the manu-
facturing  economy,  producing  $1.5  trillion  in  revenues  last  year.  Through  its  mem-
bership, the NAM has access to a large number of U.S. manufacturers, and has the

means  to  both  communicate  and  market  to  candidate  companies  on  the  availability
of  energy  efficiency  resources.  In  support  of  the  NAM’s  agenda  to  establish  a  na-
tional commitment to reduce energy intensity of the U.S. economy through strategic
goal-setting,  public-private  partnership  and  consumer  education,  the  NAM  created
its Energy Efficiency Task Force.

The  NAM  further  affirmed  the  importance  of  energy  efficiency  with  the  release
of  its  comprehensive  model  energy  legislation  earlier  this  year,  the  Energy  Security
for American Competitiveness Act (ESAC), which treats energy efficiency as a virtual
domestic  energy  source  that  can  displace  imports.  The  NAM  recently  signed  a
Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  with  the  DOE  to  promote  increased  indus-
trial  energy  efficiency  among  NAM  member  companies.  The  purpose  of  this  MOU
is  to  establish  a  working  arrangement  between  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy
(DOE)  Office  of  Energy  Efficiency  and  Renewable  Energy’s  Industrial  Technologies
Program  (ITP)  and  the  NAM.  The  NAM  and  the  EPA’s  Energy  Star  Program  are
working  on  a  partnership.  The  NAM  continues  to  work  on  this  project  with  NGO
partners,  such  as  the  Alliance  to  Save  Energy  (ASE)  and  the  American  Council  for
an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

This MOU supports a variety of activities, which aim to assist manufacturing fa-
cilities to initiate and implement energy management programs, adopt clean energy
efficient  technologies,  and  achieve  continual  energy  efficiency  and  intensity  reduc-
tion  improvements.  NAM  and  DOE  will  also  coordinate  in  measuring  and  docu-
menting  the  energy  savings  achieved  in  NAM  member  company  manufacturing  fa-
cilities as impacted by the energy efficiency campaign supported by the parties and
other  partners  to  the  extent  the  information  is  available.  This  MOU  represents  a
non-binding  expression  of  intent  between  the  parties  to  work  together  to  promote
energy efficiency in manufacturing.

As we face the interrelated issues of energy security and climate change, we must
increasingly rely on the energy we do not use as the fuel of choice. Energy efficiency
is the well we must tap for this resource.

High  global  oil  prices  affect  the  economy  as  a  whole.  Natural  gas  prices  differ
widely around the world, from 75 cents per million Btu in the Middle East to a fore-
cast of nearly $9.00 for this coming winter in the U.S. Since we often can’t pass on
our  energy  costs  in  the  price  of  our  products,  manufacturers  become  the  shock  ab-
sorber for volatile and high natural gas prices.

Manufacturing  is  the  leading  edge  of  demand  destruction  in  the  face  of  high  en-
ergy prices. And demand destruction is just a more palatable economic term for job
destruction.  Figure  2  shows  how  high  energy  costs  have  contributed  to  over  three
million  high  paying  manufacturing  jobs  being  lost  since  the  run  up  in  natural  gas
prices began in 2000.

The Energy Efficiency Task Force, chaired by Dow, is partnering with DOE, EPA
EnergyStar, the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an Energy Effi-
cient  Economy,  and  other  energy  efficiency  organizations  to  make  use  of  readily
available tools which will help manufacturers identify and address cost-effective en-
ergy efficiency opportunities.

The partners are providing their specific expertise and services to access, commu-
nicate,  and  market  to  a  large  number  of  U.S.  manufacturers,  and  deliver  a  consoli-
dated  catalog  of  tools,  technologies,  and  a  menu  of  options  for  future  direction  in
energy  management.  NAM  will  utilize  a  website  portal  to  access  the  right  energy
efficient  technology,  a  consolidated  library  of  tools,  and  roadmaps  to  implementing
effective energy management programs.

Through  marketing  and  outreach  efforts,  the  partners  plan  to  reach  a  greater
number  of  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturers;  help  them  progress  toward
greater energy efficiency; and establish systems and technology improvements capa-
ble of delivering immediate and sustaining long-term energy savings.
Recommendations for Congress and the Administration

The  ITP  program  offers  a  wide  range  of  important  benefits  to  the  manufacturing

sector:

• The  program  provides  training  for  the  next  generation  of  manufacturing  en-
ergy  efficiency  engineers  through  the  Industrial  Assessment  Program.  Grad-
uates  of  this  program  have  a  proven  track  record  of  being  able  to  perform  in
jobs much more quickly than students without the experience. These students
also  become  sensitive  to  identifying  and  implementing  energy  efficiency  op-
portunities.
• The program has the ability to convene representatives from a wide range of
companies to work on manufacturing issues as a whole, without raising anti-
trust concerns.
• The  program’s  cooperative  RD&D  efforts  have  been  valuable  to  industry  by
allowing  industry  and  government  to  work  together  to  target  research  that
meets the needs of manufacturing industries, resulting in near-term impacts.
Dow and NAM support the ITP, which is currently the only federal program that

supports manufacturing research.

To strengthen the program, we recommend the following:

of the program.

Conclusion

U.S. manufacturers are doing a great deal to improve their energy efficiency per-
formance.  High  U.S.  energy  prices  are  a  driver,  as  are  the  dual  problems  of  energy
dependence  and  rising  GHG  emissions.  But  a  sole  reliance  on  private  sector  action
is  not  going  to  solve  these  problems.  A  partnership  between  the  private  and  public
sectors  will  be  required  to  promote  energy  efficiency,  the  development  of  renewable
and alternative energy, and the development and deployment of energy-saving tech-
nologies.

Public  policy  plays  an  important  role,  and  Congress  must  enact  measures  to  re-
duce demand, increase supply, and promote alternatives. The first order of business
should  be  to  promote  energy  efficiency.  The  DOE  ITP  program  represents  the  kind
of government program that is necessary to help U.S. manufacturers identify oppor-
tunities  for  energy  savings  through  efficiency.  We  believe  this  very  valuable  pro-
gram should be strengthened in order to promote energy efficiency across the manu-
facturing sector, increase our energy security, and reduce GHG emissions.

STATEMENT OF MR. PAUL N. CICIO, PRESIDENT, INDUSTRIAL

ENERGY CONSUMERS OF AMERICA

Mr.  CICIO.  Good  afternoon,  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Mem-

ber Inglis. Thank you for the opportunity to be here.

The  Industrial  Energy  Consumers  of  America  (IECA)  is  a  na-
tional,  non-profit,  non-partisan  trade  association  whose  member-
ship are exclusively energy-intensive industry companies. The man-
ufacturing  sector  competes  globally,  where  energy-intensive  indus-
tries  reducing  energy  consumption  is  essential.  We  either  contin-
ually  reduce  our  energy  consumption  per  unit  of  product,  or  we
cease  to  be  competitive.  And  while  energy  efficiency  is  highly  val-
ued  by  the  industrial  sector,  other  energy  issues  weigh  heavy  on
us and can overshadow the benefits of energy efficiency.

Since  2000,  the  manufacturing  sector  has  lost  3.1  million  jobs,
specifically 18 percent of all manufacturing jobs. To our knowledge
this  is  the  first  time  in  U.S.  history  where  we  have  lost  manufac-
turing  jobs  despite  robust  economic  growth  for  the  last  four  years.
High  relative  energy  costs,  particularly  natural  gas  costs  and  now
rising  electricity  costs,  have  been  a  significant  factor  for  these  en-
ergy-intensive  industries,  and  we  are  fearful  that  if  Congress  does
not increase availability and affordability of domestic energy, more
manufacturing plants will move offshore.

Manufacturers  are  also  wary  of  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of
Congressional efforts to cap greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse
gas  emission  concerns  have  already  incentivised  power  generators
to  increase  their  consumption  of  natural  gas  by  19  percent  since
2000,  which  has  driven  up  the  cost  of  natural  gas  and  electricity
for  all  consumers.  And  we  are  concerned  that  without  resolving
these issues more manufacturing jobs will be lost.

While  the  industrial  sector  represents  32  percent  of  U.S.  energy
consumption,  we  have  demonstrated  absolutely  remarkable  per-
formance  in  energy  efficiency.  Since  1990,  the  industrial  sector
total  energy  consumption  increased  by  one  percent,  and  we  in-
creased  the  total  industrial  value  of  shipments  by  almost  32  per-
cent. The ITP Program has been an important part of that success
story.

Improvement  in  energy  efficiency  has  also  played  an  important
role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the industrial sector,
the  direct  and  indirect  greenhouse  gas  carbon  emissions,  in  2006,
are  below  the  1990,  levels.  Residential  carbon  emissions  are  up  31
percent,  commercial,  up  34,  transportation,  up  25,  electricity  pro-
duction, up 32 percent. So the performance of the industrial sector
has been remarkable.

There  is  no  sector  in  the  economy  that  is  more  supportive  of  en-
ergy efficiency than our sector. The Industrial Technology Program
gets high marks from the IECA member companies. Given the rel-
atively  modest  federal  money  dedicated  to  the  program,  the  bene-
fits  to  the  industrial  sector  and  to  the  United  States  economy  are
significant. In our view we simply need to do more of the same, in-
cluding  restoring  higher  levels  of  funding.  We  do  support  higher
levels  for  cost-sharing  research,  demonstration,  and  deployment  of
technology  and  continue  to  expand  programs  like  Save  Energy
Now.

The industrial sector needs R&D in areas that provide long-term,
cost-effective  solutions,  particularly  for  the  high-risk,  high-value,
long-term  process  technology.  Examples  of  R&D  interests  of  our
members  deal  with  control  systems,  optimization  of  energies  in
steam  generation,  process  heaters,  heat  recovery  technology,  and
alternative energy fuels and feedstocks.

Lastly,  IECA  member  companies  wish  to  be  sure  this  Sub-
committee knows how much they value the Save Energy Now Pro-
gram. Save Energy Now is a superb program because it helps com-
panies  accelerate  finding  high-quality  energy  reduction  projects
through  plant  assessments  and  uses  existing  technology,  existing
products,  and  existing  knowledge  to  reduce  energy  consumption.
The  200  assessments  completed  in  2006,  found  over  $500  million
in potential energy savings, and the DOE spent only $3 million on
the  specific  program.  A  tremendous  investment  for  federal  dollars.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL N. CICIO

Good  afternoon  Chairman  Lampson  and  Ranking  Member  Inglis.  Thank  you  for
the opportunity to testify before this important subcommittee and on this very time-
ly topic.

The Industrial Energy Consumers of America (IECA) is a national non-profit non-
partisan cross-industry trade association whose membership is exclusively from the
energy  intensive  manufacturing  sector  and  is  dedicated  to  a  broad  array  of  energy
and environment related issues.

The  manufacturing  sector  competes  globally.  For  energy  intensive  industries,  re-
ducing energy consumption per unit of product produced is essential. We either con-
tinually  reduce  our  energy  cost  per  unit  of  product  or  we  will  cease  to  be  competi-
tive.

While  the  industrial  sector  represents  32.2  percent  of  the  U.S.  energy  consump-
tion we have demonstrated remarkable performance in energy reduction. Since 1980
the  industrial  sector  total  energy  consumption  increased  by  only  one  percent  while
increasing total industrial value of shipments by 53 percent.

Improvement  in  energy  efficiency  has  also  played  an  important  role  in  reducing
GHG  emissions.  The  industrial  sector  direct  and  indirect  carbon  dioxide  emissions
in 2006 are slightly below the 1990 level while GHG emissions from the residential
sector increased 31.4 percent; commercial +34.6 percent; transportation +25 percent
and electricity + 31.7 percent.

Energy is used as both fuel and feedstock and can represent as high as 70 percent
of  the  cost  of  producing  some  products.  For  perspective,  the  industrial  sector  con-
tains about 226,000 manufacturing sites. However, there are about 6,800 sites that
use  greater  than  $2  million  of  energy  annually  and  consume  about  53  percent  of
all energy in the industrial sector.

The  Industrial  Technology  Program  gets  high  marks  from  IECA  member  compa-
nies. Given the relatively modest federal money dedicated to the program, the bene-
fits to the industrial sector and the U.S. economy are significant.

In  our  view,  we  simply  need  to  do  more  of  the  same.  IECA  supports  greater
spending  on  R&D  programs  that  provide  cost  sharing  research,  demonstration  and

deployment  of  technology  and  continuing  to  expand  programs  like  ‘‘Save  Energy
Now.’’

The  industrial  sector  needs  R&D  in  areas  that  provides  long-term  cost-effective
technology solutions, particularly for high-risk high-value long-term technology. Ex-
amples of R&D areas of interest are: energy management systems that include con-
trol  and  data  acquisition;  control  system  improvements  and  optimization  in  the
areas  of  steam  generation,  process  heaters;  heat  recovery  technology;  and  alter-
native energy sources for fuels and feedstock.

Lastly,  IECA  member  companies  wish  to  be  sure  this  Subcommittee  knows  how
much  they  value  the  ‘‘Save  Energy  Now’’  program.  ‘‘Save  Energy  Now’’  is  a  superb
program because it helps companies accelerate finding high quality energy reduction
projects  through  plant  assessments  and  uses  existing  technology,  product  and
knowledge to reduce energy consumption.

Thank you.

BIOGRAPHY FOR PAUL N. CICIO

Paul  N.  Cicio  has  been  the  President  of  the  Industrial  Energy  Consumers  of
America (IECA) since its founding six years ago. IECA is a non-profit trade associa-
tion  created  to  promote  the  interests  of  manufacturing  companies  for  which  the
availability,  use  and  cost  of  energy,  power  or  feedstock  play  a  significant  role  in
their  ability  to  compete  in  domestic  and  world  markets.  Membership  represents  a
diverse  set  of  energy  intensive  industries  including:  plastics,  cement,  aluminum,
paper, food processing, brick, chemicals, fertilizer, insulation, steel, glass, industrial
gases, pharmaceutical and brewing.

Mr.  Cicio  is  well  know  in  Washington  circles  as  a  consumer  advocate  for  the  in-
dustrial  sector  on  issues  related  to  natural  gas  supply,  natural  gas  price  manipula-
tion,  electricity,  energy  efficiency  and  climate  change  policy.  He  has  testified  four
times  before  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives;  twice  before  the  U.S.  Senate;  and
twice before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He has also intervened at
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

In 2006, the Secretary of the Interior appointed Mr. Cicio to the U.S. Department
of  Interior  Outer  Continental  Shelf  Policy  Advisory  Committee.  And  in  2007,  the
Secretary of Energy appointed him to the National Coal Council, an advisory council
to the Secretary. In both appointments, Mr. Cicio became the first energy consumer
advocate.

Previous to IECA, Mr. Cicio was employed by The Dow Chemical Company where
he  held  a  number  of  diverse  responsibilities  including:  hydrocarbons  and  energy
global  issues  management  and  Federal  Government  affairs,  hydrocarbons  and  en-
ergy  senior  commercial  manager,  marketing  manager,  district  sales  manager,  prod-
uct  sales  manager  and  field  sales.  He  retired  from  Dow  Chemical  with  almost  30
years of service.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  LAWRENCE  W.  KAVANAGH,  VICE  PRESI-
DENT,  MANUFACTURING  AND  TECHNOLOGY,  AMERICAN
IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE
Mr.  KAVANAGH.  Thank  you,  and  good  afternoon.  I  work  at  the
American Iron and Steel Institute, but today I am representing the
Alliance  for  Materials,  Manufacturing  Excellence,  or  AMMEX.
AMMEX  consists  of  manufacturers  in  aluminum,  chemicals,  glass,
forest  products,  metal  casting,  and  steel  and  other  organizations
concerned about energy use and competitive manufacturing. So my
remarks are in that larger context today.

A little bit of background. The Inter-Governmental Panel on Cli-
mate Change says that we need to reduce CO2 emissions by 50 per-
cent  by  2050  to  keep  global  warming  below  two  degrees.  Two  de-
grees  is  kind  of  the  threshold  above  which  bad  stuff  happens  and
below  which  everything  is  okay.  So  if  you  look  at  the  chart  that  is
in my testimony, it shows the improvements in energy use and CO2
emissions  that  materials  manufacturers  have  made  over  time,  and

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:43 Feb 28, 2008 Jkt 037982 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\092507\37982 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

19

a lot of that was done in cooperation with DOE and the gentleman
to  my  right  has  already  quoted  the  figures  and  facts  extensively.
So the energy usage gains that we have been able to make make
sense because all processes are mature, and we have been working
on lowering energy use for some time.

However,  it  also  shows,  and  this  is  the  key  point,  that  to  make
any  significant  change  in  energy  use  and  CO2 emissions  going  for-
ward,  new  processes  are  required.  There  is  just  not  enough  left  in
today’s processes because we are relatively energy efficient already.
Not to get to the big gains that are required or will be required in
a carbon-constrained economy.

So  whether  you  call  these  breakthrough,  game  changing,  or
transformational technologies, new process development is the only
path  to  meeting  society’s  needs  regarding  energy  use  and  CO2
emissions.

AMMEX  supports  an  ITP  Program  establishing  a  public,  private
R&D  focused  on  new  process  development  over  the  long-term,  and
our  estimates  indicate  the  same  as  has  been  already  mentioned
that  a  funding  level  of  the  late  ’90s  period  of  $125  million  or  so  is
a good place to start.

Federal  dollars  coupled  with  industry  dollars  is  a  very  powerful
combination,  and  not  only  addresses  the  technical  challenges  we
face,  but  by  placing  this  joint  funding  at  universities,  it  also  ad-
dresses  our  crucial  and  expanding  need  for  the  next  generation  of
scientists and innovators in our industries.

We also recognize there is a need for near-term and incremental
work, and this part of the program should address censors, motors,
steam, pumps, and the like, and it should also invite the participa-
tion  of  new  stakeholders  that  may  have  more  room  for  improve-
ment in the near term than materials manufacturing.

In  summary,  it  is  necessary  that  we  realize  we  could  not
incrementalize to the type of energy savings necessary to manufac-
ture  in  the  carbon-constrained  world.  High-efficiency  motors  and
light  bulbs  will  simply  not  be  enough  to  come  close.  Reducing  en-
ergy use and CO2 emissions are everyone’s responsibility, the pub-
lic  and  the  private  sector.  And  the  way  to  meet  this  challenge  is
to  create  a  jointly-funded  R&D  program  to  transform  industrial
processes into ones that use less and diverse forms of energy while
emitting little or no CO2.

Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Kavanagh follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE W. KAVANAGH

Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and  other  Members  of  the  Sub-

committee, thank you for inviting me here to speak today.

My  name  is  Lawrence  Kavanagh  and  I  am  Vice  President—Manufacturing  and
Technology  at  the  American  Iron  and  Steel  Institute.  I  am  here  today  on  behalf  of
the Alliance for Materials Manufacturing Excellence or AMMEX. The organizations
that  are  AMMEX  members  include  the  basic  materials  manufacturing  sector  [alu-
minum,  chemicals,  forest  products,  glass,  metal  casting,  steel]  in  the  U.S.  economy
along  with  several  stakeholders  in  materials  manufacturing,  such  as  the  Northeast
Midwest Coalition, the National Association of State Energy Officials and the Amer-
ican Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

The  member  organizations  of  AMMEX  have  been  partners  with  the  Department
of Energy’s Industrial Technology Program since its inception. ITP is a true public-
private partnership. DOE and materials manufacturers jointly fund cutting-edge re-
search  that  addresses  the  needs  of  the  Nation  and  materials  manufacturers.  All

projects  have  the  shared  goals  of  reducing  energy  consumption,  reducing  environ-
mental impact and increasing competitive advantage of U.S. materials manufactur-
ers.

By reducing the energy intensity of materials manufacturers and accelerating the
delivery  of  new  technology,  ITP  has  helped  make  U.S.  materials  manufacturers
more competitive in global markets, preserving and creating good-paying jobs in the
process.  The  program  is  unique  because  we  select  only  projects  with  ‘‘dual  bene-
fits’’—a  public  benefit  such  as  reduced  emissions  or  petroleum  use,  justifying  the
federal funding; and an industry benefit such as a more efficient process, justifying
the industrial funding.

By  reviewing  the  chart  above,  one  can  see  that  materials  manufacturers  have
greatly  reduced  energy  use  since  1990  because  of  their  co-investment  with  DOE.
Materials  manufacturers  have  become  very  efficient  for  the  processes  they  operate
today and in order to make the type of gains in the future that have been seen since
1990,  new  process  development  is  required.  Research  and  development  efforts  into
new  processes  will  open  up  large  energy  savings  and  carbon  dioxide  mitigation  op-
portunities.

AMMEX fully supports the Bill’s focus on the development and deployment of new

process technologies.

U.S.  materials  manufacturing  continues  to  face  challenges  resulting  from  in-
creased cost and decreased availability of traditional energy supply resources. These
challenges  have  stimulated  innovation  in  the  materials  manufacturing  sector  in
order  to  create  significant  energy  improvements  and  to  diversify  the  energy  sup-
plies.  While  the  innovations  of  the  past  have  brought  the  materials  manufacturing
sector  a  long  way,  the  sector  cannot  go  further  without  new  innovations.  In  order
to  do  this,  the  materials  manufacturing  processes  must  be  transformed,  i.e.,  new
processes  and  new  innovations  must  be  developed  which  will  use  much  less  energy
and which will be able to utilize diverse forms of energy.

To accomplish these goals, the Federal Government and industry will need to em-
bark  upon  a  co-funded  effort  to  broaden  and  accelerate  inherently  high-risk  re-
search,  development,  and  deployment  of  new  materials  manufacturing  processes
that  utilize  diverse  energy  sources.  This  effort  will  also  allow  the  materials  manu-
facturing  sector  to  lessen  dependence  on  natural  gas  and  oil  resources  and  conven-
tional  electricity  sources—thus  benefiting  consumers  through  contribution  to  a  sta-
ble energy market.

Dramatic  increases  in  industrial  energy  prices  and  growing  global  competition
threaten  the  vitality  and  the  future  of  U.S.  materials  manufacturing.  Unless  this
trend is reversed, American manufacturing jobs in these key industries will increas-
ingly  move  overseas.  Manufacturers  have  responded  to  such  challenges  in  the  past

by applying the power of innovation to create new products and processes that sus-
tain the foundation of the U.S. economy.

Secondarily,  proposed  changes  within  the  DOE  Industrial  Technologies  Program

are also supported by AMMEX members:

• The  broadening  of  the  stakeholder  group  to  include  data  centers  and  food
processors  is  important  as  it  may  offer  opportunities  for  incremental  energy
savings in the near-term

• The establishment of a cross-cutting portfolio that includes lightweight mate-
rials  research,  inclusive  of  those  made  by  AMMEX  members  [e.g.,  advanced
high  strength  steels,  aluminum,  metal  castings,  composites,  glasses  and  oth-
ers]

• The  establishment  of  a  cross-cutting  portfolio  that  includes  nano-manufac-
turing so long as it recognizes that materials made by AMMEX members are
in fact nano-materials.

AMMEX  remains  concerned  with  the  recent  funding  levels  of  ITP.  In  the  years
1990–96  the  program  consisted  largely  of  ‘‘industry  specific  funding’’  and  averaged
$100  million  annually.  Both  the  House  and  Senate  appropriations  bills  would  in-
crease  the  total  funding  for  ITP  to  $58  million.  However,  this  amount  remains  far
less  than  historical  levels  for  the  program,  and  far  less  than  what  is  necessary  to
go after the sizable benefits associated with new process development. As the Com-
mittee further examines ITP, we request your assistance in:

• Increasing funding for ITP to at least $125 million.
• Retaining  a  balanced  portfolio  of  research  from  the  point  of  view  of  research
application,  i.e.,  that  the  portfolio  includes  both  industry  specific  R&D  in  at
least  aluminum,  chemicals,  forest  products,  glass,  metal  casting  and  steel;
and cross-cutting research.

• Retaining  a  balanced  portfolio  of  research  from  the  point  of  view  of  research
impact,  i.e.,  that  50  percent  or  more  of  the  funding  go  to  research  into  new
process development [where the energy savings potential in industry is high-
est].

We would be happy to provide input to the Committee detailing the above points.
The  U.S.  also  faces  serious  shortages  in  the  science  and  engineering  manpower
that  is  needed  to  keep  America’s  competitive  edge  in  world  markets  through  tech-
nology  innovation  and  timely  application.  From  the  President’s  State  of  the  Union
Address  to  the  Protecting  America’s  Competitive  Edge  Act  in  Congress,  the  Nation
is  awakening  to  the  need  for  a  re-energizing  of  our  commitment  to  technology  edu-
cation.

We have proposed to the Committee an effort to both rebuild America’s materials
manufacturing industries and revitalize our science and engineering institutions. It
builds  a  new  public-private  partnership  to  support  these  twin  goals.  It  will  ensure
that  the  U.S.  materials  manufacturing  industry  will  remain  vital  and  competitive
through:

• Accelerating  technology  innovation  to  ensure  the  future  competitiveness,  re-
source  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  our  domestic  materials  manufacturing
industry;

• Building  the  vital  intellectual  infrastructure,  in  American  universities  and
laboratories,  that  will  work  in  partnership  with  the  materials  manufacturing
industry; and

• Maintaining  the  healthy  American  materials  manufacturing  base,  which  is

vital to our national security.

Our proposal would accomplish these goals by:

• Establishing  an  industry  co-funded  research  program  that  develops  the  inno-
vative, breakthrough technologies that will sustain our competitiveness, while
realizing national goals in energy and resource efficiency;

• Supporting  materials  manufacturing  research  programs  at  universities  and

research institutions across the country;

• Establishing a program that accelerates the adoption of technology innovation

in the marketplace; and

• Assisting  industrial  facilities  in  identifying  opportunities  for  greater  energy

efficiency, improved product quality and reduced environmental impacts.

BIOGRAPHY FOR LAWRENCE W. KAVANAGH

Mr.  Kavanagh  is  responsible  for  AISI’s  activities  concerning  how  steel  is  made
today, how steel will be made in the future and how steel competes with other mate-
rials, and alignment of these tasks with AISI’s overall goal of making steel the ‘‘ma-
terial  of  choice.’’  These  include  oversight  of  a)  various  manufacturing  committees
whose main goals are extensive operations benchmarking and the development and
sharing of best practices, problem-solving and the identification of ‘‘technical needs’’
which  would  lower  cost,  advance  safety,  etc.;  b)  collaborative  research  and  develop-
ment among steel makers, suppliers, universities and labs designed to improve proc-
ess  control,  performance  and/or  climinate  technical  barriers  to  market  growth;  c)
programs to evaluate how steel performs vs. competing materials in order to assess
where  we  have  advantages/disadvantages  with  the  goal  of  developing  projects  to
widen our lead/narrow the gap as appropriate.

Prior  to  joining  AISI  in  1991,  Mr.  Kavanagh  was  General  Manager,  Engineering
for  Davy  International’s  Automation  Services  Division  [now  doing  business  as
Kvaerner  and  VAI].  In  this  capacity,  Mr.  Kavanagh  was  responsible  for  all  phases
of  project  execution—estimating,  sales  support,  specification,  engineering,  project
management, field start-up and acceptance testing for Davy’s steel plant equipment
installations around the world.

Mr.  Kavanagh  is  a  graduate  of  the  University  of  Notre  Dame  [BSEE]  and  the
‘mini-MBA’  program  at  George  Mason  University.  He  is  an  active/former  board
member of various community service and research organizations.
Chairman LAMPSON. You are welcome. Thank you.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MALCOLM  E.  VERDICT,  ASSOCIATE  DI-
RECTOR, ENERGY SYSTEMS LABORATORY, TEXAS A&M ENGI-
NEERING  PROGRAM,  TEXAS  ENGINEERING  EXPERIMENT
STATION
Mr.  VERDICT.  Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Inglis,  and
Members of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment,
I would like to thank you for this opportunity to testify on the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Industrial Assessment Centers, which pro-
vides technical assistance for small and medium-sized manufactur-
ers  and  industrial  facilities,  utilizing  university,  faculty,  and  stu-
dents from 26 universities around the Nation.

My name is Malcolm Verdict, and I appear before you this after-
noon  representing  the  Texas  Engineering  Experiment  Station  lo-
cated in College Station, Texas. The Texas Engineering Experiment
Station, known as TEES, is a statewide engineering research agen-
cy of the State of Texas. We are located on the Texas A&M campus
where our engineering programs educate over 9,000 undergraduate
and graduate engineering students every year.

We  have  run  an  industrial  assessment  center  for  the  past  21
years  and  have  seen  first-hand  the  tremendous  positive  benefits  it
has  had  on  industry  and  our  young  engineering  students.  I  would
like to address three main points this afternoon for the Committee.
First,  the  many  valuable  contributions  of  the  program,  some  of  its
current  limitations,  and  recommendations  to  build  upon  its  past
successes.

First,  the  Industrial  Assessment  Centers  (IAC)  have  made  sig-
nificant,  long-term  contributions  to  industry  and  to  the  education
of  participating  engineering  students.  The  program  is  very  unique
within DOE since it directly involves engineering students in close

partnership  with  industry.  Engineering  faculty  and  undergraduate
students  conduct  on-site  assessments.  These  are  typically  one-day
visits  and  provide  written  recommendations  to  the  owners  and  op-
erators for saving energy and reducing pollution.

The many valuable benefits from this program include; one, pro-
viding  cost-effective  recommendations  for  reducing  energy  and  pol-
lution  and  increasing  their  productivity.  Two,  enabling  small  and
medium-sized  manufacturers  in  industry  to  compete  in  a  highly-
competitive  global  economy.  Three,  providing  real  world  energy-re-
lated  job  experience  for  engineering  students,  and  finally,  creating
valuable  new  industrial  partnerships  for  the  participating  univer-
sities.

Some  significant  IAC  Program  successes  include  over  13,500  as-
sessments  have  been  made  involving  over  3,000  engineering  stu-
dents. Participating facilities save on average $5,500 per year with
a  payback  often  less  than  12  months.  U.S.  companies  have  saved
more  than  700  million  in  energy  and  productivity  gains  according
to  the  Department  of  Energy.  In  fact,  enough  energy  has  been
saved  to  power  the  city  of  Boston,  Massachusetts.  And  more  than
1.5 million industrial jobs have been created through this program.
Mr.  Chairman,  giving  you  a  good  Texas  example,  the  Texas  Tile
Manufacturing Company in Houston, Texas, is but one great exam-
ple  of  the  many  valuable  benefits  with  DOE  Program  provides  its
clients.  With  high  energy  prices,  inefficient  energy  practices,  in-
creased  foreign  competition,  and  located  within  the  EPA-des-
ignated,  non-attainment  area,  this  manufacturer  was  an  ideal  IAC
Program  candidate.  In  2006,  our  Texas  A&M  team  conducted  an
on-site  assessment  and  identified  over  $250,000  in  energy  savings
and  enabled  the  firm  to  find  an  additional  $100,000  in  savings
while implementing all of the team’s recommendations.

Equally  important,  the  energy  savings  are  helping  the  Houston
region meet its EPA clean air requirements. It bears repeating that
the  IAC  Program  helps  educate  students  with  highly-critical  engi-
neering  skills  needed  in  the  Nation’s  next  engineering  workforce.
Most  IAC  graduates  go  on  to  energy-related  jobs  in  industry,  na-
tional laboratories, U.S. Department of Energy, and in engineering
teaching  careers.  In  fact,  a  University  of  Tennessee  study  on  the
careers  of  IAC  graduates  found  that  73  percent  of  those  surveyed
held  a  position  at  one  time  related  to  energy  efficiency,  and  an
amazing 58 percent of these graduates have remained in energy ef-
ficiency  as  a  part  of  their  job  description  throughout  their  career.
While  the  Industrial  Assessment  Centers  have  made  significant,
long-term  contributions  to  industry,  it  is  not  achieving  its  full  po-
tential  in  our  opinion.  Some  examples  of  program  limitations  in-
clude  program  management  continuity  and  resources  have  been
very  inconsistent,  especially  in  the  last  three  years.  Participation
by  only  26  universities  leaves  some  areas  of  the  Nation  under-
served.  The  program  fails  to  address  other  valuable  target  audi-
ences.  The  program  does  not  include  an  energy  research  compo-
nent, which limits its opportunities for university, facility, and stu-
dent  educational  activities.  And  there  is  no  clear  charter  to  lever-
age federal dollars.

Finally,  program  success  metrics  do  not  incorporate  the  value  of
training  our  nation’s  future  energy  engineers.  We  believe  that  the

IAC  Program,  which  is  already  a  very  good  program,  could  be  en-
hanced.  Some  suggestions  for  improvement  include  recreating  an
IAC-like  program  advisory  group  within  the  Office  of  Industrial
Program,  expanding  the  target  audience  to  include  medium-sized
commercial  buildings  and  federal  facilities  to  be  run  by  other  pro-
grams  within  DOE.  Expanding  the  geographic  coverage  by  author-
izing  centers  in  all  50  states  and  territories  where  practical,  in-
creasing the educational effectiveness through applied research ac-
tivities  such  as  regularly  involving  IAC  students  as  summer  in-
terns  at  national  laboratories  and  in  other  DOE-funded  industrial
and  commercial  building  research  activities.  And  finally,  author-
izing  adequate  resources  to  implement  an  expanded  IAC  Program.
Mr.  Chairman,  I  was  asked  to  comment  on  the  Subcommittee
draft  legislation  entitled  Industrial  Energy  Efficiency  Act  for  2007.
This  draft  already  addresses  many  of  the  items  mentioned  in  my
oral  and  written  testimony.  We  applaud  your  efforts  to  expand
upon this very valuable program and to broaden its impact.

In  conclusion,  the  IACs  have  been  highly  successful  at  helping
reduce  industrial  energy  efficiencies,  pollution,  and  providing  cost
savings while providing critical education to the Nation’s engineer-
ing  students.  Congress  showed  much  forethought  and  wisdom  in
creating  this  program,  and  the  concept  is  still  very  relevant  today
as  our  nation  faces  even  greater  energy  environmental  challenges.
In  fact,  the  IAC  Program  is  a  perfect  trifecta  energy  environment
and education in my opinion.

After 32 years of success now is the time for improving this great
program  to  help  meet  tomorrow’s  energy  needs  and  train  the  next
generation of energy engineers.

Mr.  Chairman  and  distinguished  members,  again,  I  thank  you
for  the  opportunity  to  appear  her  this  afternoon  and  point  out  the
importance  of  the  IAC  Program  to  our  nation’s  energy  future  and
to share our ideas to increase its effectiveness.

This  concludes  my  remarks,  and  I  am  happy  to  respond  to  any

questions the Members may have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Verdict follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MALCOLM E. VERDICT

Chairman  Lampson,  Ranking  Member  Englis,  and  Distinguished  Members  of  the
House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment:

I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  testify  on  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s
(DOE) Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs), which provide technical assistance for
small  and  medium-sized  manufacturers  and  industrial  facilities  utilizing  university
faculty  and  students.  My  name  is  Malcolm  Verdict  and  I  appear  before  you  today
representing  the  Texas  Engineering  Experiment  Station  in  College  Station,  Texas.
The Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES), within the Texas A&M Engi-
neering  Program,  is  a  statewide  engineering  research  agency  of  the  State  of  Texas,
serving industry in our region while educating over 9,000 undergraduate and grad-
uate engineering students annually. TEES has a long history of partnering with in-
dustries, communities, and other academic institutions to provide practical solutions
that  help  improve  the  quality  of  life,  promote  clean  economic  development,  and  en-
hance the Nation’s educational systems. We also promote new technology education
and investigate problems in energy, renewables and the environment.

Texas A&M Engineering’s strong commitment to energy efficiency is voiced at all
levels,  especially  at  the  top.  The  Vice  Chancellor  for  Engineering,  Dr.  G.  Kemble
Bennett, recently remarked that efficient energy use must be a national priority and
that university educated energy engineers have a major role to play. Programs like
the IAC produce highly qualified energy engineers with a conservation mindset who

can hit the ground running to save energy for the Nation’s manufacturers and oth-
ers.

Congress showed much forethought and wisdom in creating this program in 1976
after  the  first  oil  supply  disruption,  which  some  of  us  in  this  room  can  still  vividly
remember. The IAC concept embraced at that time is still relevant today as the Na-
tion faces even greater energy and environmental challenges. The good news is that
with  today’s  clean  energy  technologies,  combined  with  the  expertise  and  dedication
of the graduate engineers from the IAC program, our nation is even better equipped
to  meet  these  challenges  than  when  this  program  first  began.  The  IACs  have  been
a  critical  component  in  improving  energy  efficiencies  and  providing  cost  savings  to
thousands  of  industrial  firms,  while  at  the  same  time,  training  hundreds  of  new,
dedicated  energy  efficiency  experts.  In  fact,  the  IAC  program  is  a  perfect  trifecta—
Energy, Environment and Education.

My testimony draws on my personal experience in energy management programs
and policy since 1978 at the State and federal levels, the 21 years of field experience
of  the  Texas  A&M  IAC  Center  Director,  Dr.  Warren  Heffington,  and  the  14  years
of experience of Mr. Jim Eggebrecht as our IAC Assistant Director. As you can see,
our  personnel  represent  significant  experience  and  knowledge  in  this  area  and  are
strong  advocates  for  its  importance.  I  will  address  three  key  points  this  afternoon:
• The many valuable contributions that IACs have made to industry and to the
education  of  one  of  America’s  most  valuable  natural  resources—engineering
students,

• Current limitations to the IAC program, and
• Recommendations  to  build  upon  the  successes  of  the  IAC  program  to  help
meet  the  energy  and  environmental  needs  of  industrial  facilities  and  others
during the 21st century.

Industrial  Assessment  Centers  within  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy’s
(DOE)  Industrial  Technologies  Program  (ITP)  have  made  significant,  long-
term  contributions  to  industry  and  to  the  education  of  participating  engi-
neering students since its inception in 1976.

The  IAC  program  is  unique  within  DOE  as  it  directly  involves  engineering  stu-
dents in a significant manner in partnership with industry. Using standardized pro-
cedures, engineering faculty and undergraduate and graduate students from accred-
ited  universities  provide  on-site  assessments  and  written  recommendations  for  en-
ergy  saving  and  pollution  prevention  opportunities.  This  small  but  highly  effective
DOE  program  conducts  500–600  energy  assessments  each  year  and  provides  edu-
cational opportunities for 250 new energy-efficiency engineers.

The  many  valuable  benefits  to  industry  and  to  the  participating  IAC  universities

include:

• Providing  objective  recommendations  for  reducing  energy  and  pollution  and
increasing  industrial  productivity,  using  the  latest  technologies  and  tech-
niques,
• Enabling  small  and  medium-size  manufacturers  and  industry  to  compete  in
• Facilitating  real-world  experience  for  students  analyzing  industrial  processes
• Creating  valuable  new  industrial  partnerships  for  participating  universities

who are highly sought after upon graduation, and

a highly competitive global economy,

in their energy engineering programs.

According to DOE, 38 different universities have participated in the IAC program
since  its  inception  and  26  are  currently  participating.  The  program  name  was
changed  from  the  original  Energy  Analysis  and  Diagnostic  Centers  (EADCs)  to  the
current  name  to  reflect  its  broader  mission.  The  DOE  field  manager,  Rutgers  Uni-
versity,  maintains  a  wealth  of  program  and  applied  energy  conservation  technology
information  available  online  in  a  searchable  database  by  technology,  location,  pay-
backs, and types of participating facilities (www.Iac.rutgers.edu).

Illustrative  examples  of  notable  IAC  program  successes  include  [Source  DOE

website]:

• 13,550 assessments have been conducted as of mid-September 2007.
• Participating  facilities  have  saved  $55,000  per  year  on  average.  Payback  on
implementation  averages  only  12  months,  and  the  savings  keep  adding  up,
year after year.
• Texas  A&M  recommendations  have  resulted  in  local  manufacturers  spending

over $21 million to implement projects saving $26 million annually.

• U.S.  companies  have  saved  more  than  $700  million  through  efficiency  and

productivity improvements.

• Enough energy has been saved to power the city of Boston, MA for one year.
• More than 1.5 million industry jobs have been created and maintained in the

United States.

ting.

The  Texas  A&M  Industrial  Assessment  Center  has  performed  over  500  assess-
ments  in  companies  such  as  bakeries,  print  shops,  machine  shops,  light  manufac-
turing, and chemical, petroleum and wood product industries. The Texas Tile Manu-
facturing  Company  in  Houston,  Texas  is  a  good,  recent  example  of  the  many  bene-
fits  this  program  provides  its  clients.  With  high  energy  prices,  inefficient  energy
practices,  increased  foreign  competition  and  a  location  within  an  EPA-designated
non-attainment area, this vinyl floor manufacturer was a prime IAC candidate.

In  2006,  a  team  from  the  Texas  A&M  Industrial  Assessment  Center  identified
over $250,000 in energy savings and enabled the firm to find an additional $100,000
in  savings  while  implementing  the  team’s  recommendations.  In  all,  the  majority  of
recommendations were implemented within six months of the Texas A&M visit. The
remainder is scheduled for completion this year. Equally important, the energy sav-
ings  will  reduce  critical  air  emissions  and  help  Houston  meet  the  EPA  Clean  Air
standards.

Illustrative  examples  of  the  significant  program  benefits  to  engineering  students

include:

• Approximately  3,000  students  nationwide  have  participated  in  the  program
with over 200 from Texas A&M University and Prairie View A&M University.
• Real-world  engineering  experience  is  provided  students  in  an  industrial  set-

• Long-term energy-related careers are frequently launched upon graduation.

It bears repeating that the IAC program educates students with highly critical en-
gineering  skills  needed  in  the  Nation’s  next  engineering  workforce.  Participating
students  have  done  remarkably  well  after  graduation  in  helping  solve  our  nation’s
energy  problems.  In  fact,  the  program  produces  some  of  the  best  energy-educated
engineers in the world. Most IAC graduates go on to energy-related jobs in industry,
national  laboratories,  U.S.  DOE,  and  engineering  teaching  careers.  One  of  A&M’s
successful graduates is now the Director of the Industrial Assessment Center at the
University  of  Dayton  in  Ohio.  And,  our  assistant  director,  Jim  Eggebrecht  was  an
IAC student engineer as well. A University of Tennessee study on the careers of IAC
graduates  found  73  percent  of  those  surveyed  held  a  position  at  one  time  related
to  energy-efficiency  and  58  percent  have  remained  in  energy  efficiency  throughout
their career. (B. Tonn & J. Peretz, Univ. of Tennessee, 2002)

These are just a few examples demonstrating how IACs successfully help industry
save  energy  and  money,  while  educating  students.  The  program  has  constantly  re-
ceived  high  praise  from  assessment  recipients  and  others  familiar  with  its  impact.
As  noted  recently  by  one  senior  former  DOE  official,  the  IAC  program  was  one  of
the most successful he had seen in his 24-year career dealing with energy efficiency
at the Department.

Although the Industrial Assessment Centers have made significant, long-
term  contributions  to  industry  by  reducing  energy  use,  pollution  and  en-
ergy  costs,  and  providing  critical  energy  engineering  skills,  it  has  not
achieved its full potential.

Program limitations include:

• Program management continuity and resources have been inconsistent.
• Participation  of  only  26  universities  leaves  some  areas  of  the  Nation  under-

served.

• The  program  fails  to  address  other  viable  target  audiences  such  as  medium-

size commercial buildings and federal buildings and industrial processes.

• The program does not include an energy research component, which limits op-

portunities for university faculty and student educational activities.

• There  is  no  clear  charter  to  leverage  resources  through  cost-sharing  for  as-

sessments and for partnering with others.

• The program does not require the distribution of information on financing re-
sources  and  local  engineering  expertise  required  to  implement  more  complex
recommendations.

long-term value of training our nation’s future energy engineers.

Although  it  has  been  very  successful,  the  IAC  Program  is  not  achieving  its  full
potential. Having been around 32 years, it has naturally gone through numerous re-
organizations and managers within DOE. Within the last 10 years, the original IAC
program  managers  have  all  retired  and  new  internal  champions  have  not  emerged.
Also, no official mechanism exists for external feedback on the IAC program.

The  small  number  of  participating  universities  leaves  some  areas  of  the  Nation
under-served. Existing resources do not come close to meeting demand. For example
within  the  first  four  weeks,  the  Texas  A&M  IAC  had  applications  for  all  its  avail-
able  assessment  slots  for  the  coming  year.  Also,  there  is  no  mechanism  for
leveraging  IAC  funds  with  other  resources  such  as  utility  efficiency  and  State  en-
ergy programs which also target industrial end users.

The  industrial  sector  has  proven  to  be  a  wise  choice  for  targeting  energy  ineffi-
ciencies. The IAC model would also work quite well for commercial building owners.
Buildings  represent  over  34  percent  of  our  electricity  use  in  the  U.S.  [E.IA.  2004]
and  most  buildings  need  upgrades  or  operational  improvements.  Mid-size  buildings
[25–50,000  square  feet]  are  good  candidates  for  IAC-like  assessments.  Likewise,
process energy consumption in the federal sector is over seven percent of the energy
use  in  federal  facilities  [Alliance  to  Save  Energy,  Leadership  by  Example].  The  ITP
program  has  no  charter  to  assist  the  Federal  Energy  Management  Program  even
though expertise resides in the Industrial Technologies Program and the IACs.

The  demand  for  motivated,  skilled  energy  engineers  has  never  been  greater.  The
one DOE mechanism designed to increase the educational opportunities is very lim-
ited in its approach. The program does not have an educational charter beyond stu-
dent  participation  in  industry  assessments  which  restricts  valuable  opportunities.
Faculty and students could greatly benefit from participating in industrial research
already  funded  by  U.S.  DOE.  Internships  are  also  excellent  programs  for  students
and industry but are rarely provided.

In  addition,  the  usefulness  of  the  assessment  reports  is  somewhat  limited  as  the
focus  is  primarily  on  the  energy  efficiency  recommendations.  Adding  a  program  re-
quirement  of  providing  other  implementation  information  such  as  qualified  engi-
neering  firms,  State  and  utility  industrial  programs  and  financial  resources  would
help smaller firms with limited staff.

The IAC program effectiveness could be enhanced by improving program
continuity,  expanding  the  target  audiences  and  geographic  coverage,  in-
creasing the educational value and leveraging federal program dollars.

Based  on  the  limitations  described  previously,  the  IAC  program  effectiveness

could be improved by the following actions:

and federal facilities,

territories where practical and increasing field management resources,

• Creating  an  IAC  industry/university  advisory  group  within  the  Office  of  In-
dustrial  Programs  for  enhancing  program  responsiveness  and  ensuring  con-
tinuity,
• Expanding  the  target  audience  to  include  medium-size  commercial  buildings
• Expanding the geographic coverage by authorizing centers in all 50 states and
• Providing an information clearinghouse on qualified engineering firms, utility
programs  and  rebates,  State  energy  office  industrial  programs  and  financial
resources as part of the assessment reports,
• Increasing  the  educational  effectiveness  through  applied  research  activities
such  as  regularly  involving  IAC  students  as  summer  interns  at  national  lab-
oratories and involving IAC faculty and students in other DOE funded indus-
trial and commercial building research initiatives, and

• Authorizing adequate resources to implement an expanded IAC scope.

We  are  aware  of  a  draft  Subcommittee  bill  entitled  the  ‘‘Industrial  Energy  Effi-
ciency  Act  of  2007,’’  which  addresses  many  of  the  items  covered  in  this  testimony.
We  applaud  your  efforts  to  improve  upon  the  IAC  program  which  has  served  our
country extremely well.

In  conclusion,  the  IACs  have  been  highly  successful  at  helping  reduce  industrial
inefficiencies, pollution and providing cost savings while providing critical education
to the Nation’s engineering students. However, the program is not without its limi-
tations.  After  32  years  of  success,  it  is  now  time  for  improvement  to  meet  tomor-
row’s  energy  needs.  The  current  DOE  program  and  the  required  information  pro-
vided  to  industry  should  be  expanded,  student  educational  opportunities  should  be

increased,  and  the  intrinsic,  long-term  value  of  the  educational  benefits  should  be
more fully recognized.

Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members, I thank you again for the opportunity
to  highlight  the  importance  of  the  IAC  program  to  our  nation’s  energy  future  and
to  share  some  ideas  to  increase  its  energy,  environment  and  education  impacts.  I
would be glad to respond to any questions you may have.

BIOGRAPHY FOR MALCOLM E. VERDICT

Mr.  Verdict  is  Associate  Director  of  the  Energy  Systems  Laboratory,  a  division
within  the  Texas  Engineering  Experiment  Station  and  the  Texas  A&M  University
System.  Mr.  Verdict  has  over  29  years  of  energy  management  program  and  policy
experience  at  the  State  and  federal  levels.  He  is  currently  project  manager  for  nu-
merous  building  commissioning  projects  in  large  public  and  private  buildings,  and
works closely with the Laboratory team that created the innovative emissions reduc-
tion calculator for energy and renewables.

From 1992 to 2001, he was a senior program manager at the Alliance to Save En-
ergy  in  Washington,  DC  and  was  responsible  for  their  energy  efficiency  financing,
Home  Energy  Rating,  Federal  Energy  Productivity,  Habitat  for  Humanity,  and  En-
ergy  Star  Home  initiatives.  He  worked  closely  with  DOE  to  help  develop  the  Presi-
dential  Executive  Order  13123  ‘‘Greening  the  Government  Through  Efficient  En-
ergy’’ and drafted many of the Federal Agency energy management requirements in
the  Energy  Policy  Act  2005.  He  also  served  on  DOE’s  Financial  Advisory  Sub-
committee for the International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol
(IPMVP)  and  the  Greening  of  the  White  House  (1994)  sustainability  initiative.  In
2004, he was appointed as the Texas State representative to the Western Governor’s
Energy Efficiency Task Force for Clean and Diversified Energy.

Prior  to  joining  the  Alliance  in  2001,  Malcolm  was  Deputy  Director  of  the  Texas
State  Energy  Conservation  Office  where  he  helped  create  the  award-winning  $98
million LoanSTAR energy retrofit loan program. Still going strong today, LoanSTAR
has saved Texas taxpayers over $215 million since 1990. Before entering the energy
efficiency field in 1978, Malcolm was a commercial banker in Louisiana.

He holds a Bachelor of Science (BS) from the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado
and  a  Masters  in  Business  Administration  (MBA)  from  Louisiana  Tech  University.
He is a Certified Energy Manager (C.E.M.) and was selected the ‘‘2005 Energy Man-
ager  of  the  Year’’  by  the  Association  of  Energy  Engineers.  He  holds  a  commercial

DISCUSSION

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Verdict.  All  of

you. Good presentations. We appreciate you all.

I am going to yield the first five minutes to myself as Chairman,

and we will begin our questioning process.

ITP FUNDING AND PAST ITP EFFICACY

I  am  going  to  ask  a  number  of  questions,  if  you  will.  To  begin,
I  would  like  for  all  of  you  to  comment  very  shortly  so  I  can  get
through as much of this as I possibly can.

Over the past several years the funding for the ITP Program has
been  on  a  significant  decline;  $175  million  in  2000,  to  $55  million
in  2007.  What  has  the  trend  done  to  the  efficacy  of  the  program,
and  what  is  the  appropriate  level  of  funding  that  we  need  to  be
putting into this bill?

If we just go down the line, if you don’t mind.
Mr. MOORE. Let me start. I find it amazing that we are not even
funding at the level that we were in the late 1990s, at the 175 mil-
lion  funding  level.  When  you  think  about  what  our  energy  bill  is,
I  think  Paul  may  have  mentioned  it  earlier,  but  let  me  just  put  it
in perspective for Dow.

At  an  average  price  of  $8  for  natural  gas,  my  fuel  bill  just  to
produce  steam  and  power  is  $5  billion  a  year.  I  think  that  we  are
missing  opportunities  to  drive  that  down  for  our  manufacturing
sector and impact our energy security for the United States by not
bellying  up  to  the  table  something  in  excess  of  $100  million  just
seems kind of silly.

Chairman LAMPSON. What is the right amount?
Mr.  MOORE.  I  would  say  a  good  start  is  the  $150  plus  million

that we had in the program in the 1990s, late 1990s.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you. Mr. Cicio.
Mr.  CICIO.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  need  a  significantly
well-funded program like we talked about, like in the late 1990s to
do the quality of research on projects on technologies that yield the
best opportunity. Those are the high-risk, long-term, and expensive
research  projects,  and  with  a  shrinking  budget  you  can’t  do  those
types of high-quality projects that make a big difference when they
become reality. And that is probably one of the most significant an-
swers to your question of what is the impact of reducing that fund-
ing.  You  cannot  do  projects  that  are  of  the  scale  and  magnitude
that really have the most significant payoffs.

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Kavanagh.
Mr. KAVANAGH. What he said. I mean, we—it is exactly right.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  He  didn’t  give  me  an  amount,  though,  and

I got to go, I would go back to him.

Mr. KAVANAGH. To do projects of significance, and I am here ad-
vocating  that  we  try  to  transform  our  industries,  how  we  make
steel a different way, make aluminum a different way. It takes, you
know,  in  the  ’80s  and  ’90s  when  this  program  was  at  the  125,  175
level, we were investigating. We had enough momentum when you
put  in  what  industry  was  matching  to  really  do  something  and  a
lot  of  the  processes  we  are  using  today  came  out  of  this.  Since  the
program  has  been  down  now  for  six  or  seven  years,  we  have  been
treading water trying to make due in these investments, and what
we  got  is  a  gap.  It  normally  takes  eight  to  ten  years  to  get  some-
thing  from  the  lab  into  the  plant  of  significance,  and  we  have  got
a  six-year  window  that,  you  know,  we  are  going  to  pay  a  price  at
some point in the future because we have not, you know, the pipe-
line is dry basically.

So that is the consequence.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  So  what  is  the  right  amount  to  put  in  the

bill?

Mr. KAVANAGH. The right amount to put in the bill is, I have my

testimony 125, but I like the 175 number.

Chairman LAMPSON. You want to give me a number?
Mr. CICIO. Yes, sir. One seventy-five.
Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Verdict, your turn.
Mr. VERDICT. Sir, I am not sure that I am authorized to give you
a  number,  but  I  certainly  like  hearing  some  of  the  numbers  that
are being mentioned by some of my colleagues. I would like to give
you some of the real world impacts that this tremendous reduction
has recently.

Recently  we  have  had  some  very  highly-dedicated  faculty  for  a
number  of  years  and  all  of  these  centers  and  some  of  the  program
leaders, and when you see us pulling the rug out from underneath

30

what  we  consider  a  very  successful  program  and  also  reducing  the
funding,  you  see  a  great  deal  of  disillusionment  upon  the  faculty
as  well  as  the  students.  And  even  more  importantly  is  that  by  not
putting people in the field, we used to have 500 audits per year at
the $7 million level, and that is down to 300 audits per year. What
you  really  got  is  a  lot  of  missed  opportunities,  and  that  is  energy
that is wasted if you are not there with another set of eyes helping
these small and medium-sized firms.

ITP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LIMITATIONS

Chairman LAMPSON. What are some of the limitations in the cur-
rent  efficiency  of  the  research  and  development  of  the  ITP?  Any
comment on that, limitations? Other than money.

Mr. KAVANAGH. You mean how things are carried out or——
Chairman LAMPSON. Yes.
Mr.  KAVANAGH.  The  way  the  program  is  structured  and  man-
aged, you know, the mechanism for delivering funds to universities
and  matching  them  with  industries,  that  has  been  in  place  for  20
years, and we have been in the program for 20 years, and it works.
So our opinion is the structure and delivery mechanism is right. It
is  just  the  focus  has  to  go  back  to  new  process  development,  and
the dollars have to be there to support it.

Chairman LAMPSON. Are there any specific areas of research that
could  be  enhanced  or  explored,  maybe  that  would  better  serve  the
industrial sector?

Mr. KAVANAGH. Again, I will jump in. The six industries that are
a  part  of  AMMEX,  steel,  aluminum,  glass,  forest  products,  metal
casting, and chemicals, have identified their priority research areas
going forward to do this type of transformational work, and I would
be happy to send that to you, Mr. Chairman.

CORPORATE WELFARE CONCERNS

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Please.  Okay.  How  do  you  address  the  con-
cern  of  corporate  welfare  when  discussing  the  Industrial  Tech-
nologies Program and other private, public partnerships.

Mr.  KAVANAGH.  It  is  a  very  good  question,  but  it  is  an  easy  one
to answer. Again, speaking from our realm of experience within the
AMMEX member industries, for there to be corporate welfare, cor-
porations  have  to  get  the  welfare.  Okay.  That  doesn’t  happen  in
this  program.  The  industries  don’t  receive  the  money.  They  put
money in. DOE puts money in. Industry puts money in, and the re-
cipients are places like Texas A&M. Okay.

So  the  whole  idea  of  corporate  welfare  as  far  as  this  program

goes is a myth.

be——

Chairman  LAMPSON.  But  they  do  get  the  benefit,  and  there  will

Mr. KAVANAGH. Yes, but they are co-investing. They are earning

the benefit, aren’t they?

Chairman LAMPSON. Yes, sir. Mr. Cicio.
Mr.  CICIO.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  corporate  welfare  issue  goes  back
to one of the points I had made earlier, that the breakthrough tech-
nology  in  the  most  important  areas  are  too  expensive  for  any  one

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:43 Feb 28, 2008 Jkt 037982 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\092507\37982 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

31

company,  even  the  size  of  companies  like  a  Dow  Chemical  Com-
pany, to do all by themselves.

Again,  the  breakthrough  technologies  will  be  the  technology  of
choice  for  a  period  of  20,  25,  sometimes  30  years.  You  are  talking
about major breakthrough technology. One company does not have
the money and the time and the risk tolerance to be able to do that
all by itself.

ITP RETURN ON INVESTMENT

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  What  kind  of  return  on  invest-
ment  can  your  industries  expect  from  projects  conducted  with  the
ITP  Program?  You  all  already  said  many  of  the  numbers,  but  the
match  that  you  make,  is  it  typically  equal?  What  are  some  of  the
kinds of matches that you may know of?

Mr.  KAVANAGH.  The  matches  range  in  our  industries  for  a  third
to  half,  depending  on  the  type  of  research  and  the  risk  that  is  in-
volved.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  And  then  some  of  the  returns?  Give  me

some examples of what kind of return.

Mr. KAVANAGH. Oh, the return goes to how good the projects you
pick.  So  let  me  explain  it  this  way.  The  mechanism  that  industry
uses  to  decide  what  projects  to  propose  and  fund  is  very  carefully
done  because  you  are  investing  company  capital  that  could  go  into
product  development  and  any  other  part  of  the  business.  So  when
you  select  a  research  project,  there  has  to  be  some  probability  of
success.

Within  the  steel  industry,  we  have  over  time  developed  some  60
different  projects,  and  the  level  of  successful  commercialization  of
that  technology  is  about  one  in  four.  Okay.  That  is  pretty  good  for
research,  especially,  we  are  still  learning  a  lot  from  the  three  that
don’t actually result in a commercial process or technology.

So  the  return  for  industry  as  you  pointed  out  before  is  you  get
the  benefit  of  the  technology.  It  is  getting  the  technology  to  the
plant floor, lowering your costs of operations, improving the quality
of your product, and lowering the energy bill.

Chairman LAMPSON. And ultimately lowering the cost to the con-
sumer,  which  we  are  all  after.  These  are  the  kinds  of  things  that
I think our whole Committee exists for. The more money we invest
and  the  kinds  of  programs  that  give  us  the  kinds  of  returns  that
we  are  talking  about  here,  the  better  off  we  as  a  nation  are.  We
have  always  done  that.  We  seem  to  have  slipped  some  of  late,  but
hopefully  this  and  other  ways  will  help  us  find  a  way  to  get  back.
Both  of  you  comment,  and  then  I  want  to  turn  it  over  to  the

Ranking Member.

Mr.  MOORE.  I  am  just  going  to  just  make  a  brief  comment,  not
so  much  because  I  am  not  really  here  to  testify  about  the  invest-
ment aspects but just a concept around DOE and ITP Program and
what they can do around technology.

Today the technology exists to split water via electrolysis or some
other  means,  produce  hydrogen,  use  a  gasification  plant  to  take
coal to syngas and with enough hydrogen cogeneration you can ac-
tually produce chemicals with no CO2 emissions. Zero. None. Okay.
What  we  are  missing  today  is  the  high  enough  efficiency  in
electrolyzing  that  water  to  make  hydrogen,  or  some  other  mecha-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:43 Feb 28, 2008 Jkt 037982 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\092507\37982 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

nism  to  do  that  in  order  to  make  that  economically  competitive  on
a global basis. Once we do that it means that you can use non-car-
bon source fuels like solar or photovoltaic or nuclear or the like and
match them up with a coal-to-olefins technology and basically have
a  process  that  produces  all  the  chemicals  we  rely  on  every  day  of
our lives with no CO2 emissions.

These  are  the  kinds  of  things  where  the  DOE  has  come  to  play
and  can  come  to  play  in  helping  fund  some  of  these  integrated  ef-
forts  around  fuel  diversity,  energy  diversity,  alternate  fuels,  and
feedstock.

Chairman LAMPSON. Nicely stated. Thank you.
Mr.  CICIO.  Your  question  was  about  what  kind  of  return,  that
these  companies  are  looking  at  when  they  do  cost  sharing.  And  I
am  not  an  expert  in  this  area,  but  based  on  what  the  companies
have told me, that is not nomenclature that they use in their judg-
ment in doing these R&D programs.

Even at cost sharing of 50 percent, these are risky. This is money
that  is  an  outlay  that  they  currently  have  an  alternative,  some
other alternative to do something with. Build a production facility,
expand a product line, pay employees more, employee benefits. The
rate of return is not really part of the decision-making and whether
they  invest  in  a  DOE  project  like  this  or  not.  It  is  about  are  you
going  to  make  a  commitment  to  your  future  by  potentially  having
a  winning  research  project  that  is  going  to  have  substantial  bene-
fits ten years from now.

So that type of discussion normally doesn’t happen.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you very much.
Mr. Inglis.

NATURAL GAS PRICES

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Cicio,  I  was  struck
by  your  reference  to  the  price  of  natural  gas,  and  that  is  a  signifi-
cant concern. I think you are right, that the more we use it for elec-
trical generation, the more we drive the price up and the more the
plastics  industry,  especially  in  places  like  South  Carolina’s  fourth
district, become imperiled.

DOW ENERGY EFFICIENCY EFFORTS

And,  Mr.  Moore,  I  was  very  interested  in  your  comments  about
the  incredible  savings  that  Dow  has  found.  I  think  you  also  found
incredible  savings  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Right?  I  mean,
didn’t  I  hear  that  the  other  night  from  your  CEO  about  some  in-
credible number?

Mr.  MOORE.  Actually,  if  you  go  back  to  1990,  largely  as  a  result
of our energy efficiency improvements, our actual greenhouse gases
from 1990, through today are actually down more than 20 percent.

Mr. INGLIS. Yeah.
Mr. MOORE. All of those energy efficiency efforts.
Mr. INGLIS. Yeah.
Mr.  MOORE.  At  the  same  time  that  we  have  grown  our  company

substantially.

Mr. INGLIS. It is very impressive, so that is very encouraging.

ITP ENERGY SAVINGS

You  reached  significant  savings.  I  think  you  said  $4.5  billion  in
savings as a result of the energy efficiency that you have achieved.
Right?

Mr. MOORE. Right.
Mr.  INGLIS.  So  I  guess  some  people  would  say,  and  perhaps  this
is what the Administration is saying, that Dow did it for very good
reasons,  and  that  is  their  citizens,  your  citizens  of  the  world,  and
you  are  in  this  country,  and  you  are  also  interested  in  making
money,  which  is  a  wonderful  thing.  I  am  all  for  making  money.  I
think  profit  is  a  great  thing,  and  so  $4.5  billion  delivered  to  the
bottom  line  is  a  pretty  substantial  incentive  to  a  company  to  do
this.  And  so  some  would  say  why  have  the  Department  of  Energy
help with that if Dow is going to get the benefit. Right?

Mr. MOORE. I think the important thing here is not so much the
benefit  that  Dow  is  going  to  get  from  the  ITP  Program.  It  is  the
benefit  that  literally  the  thousands  of  others  will  get  from  it.  One
might wonder that, you know, I mentioned the Texas city example
where  Dow  actually  found  benefit  from  ITP’s  Industrial  Assess-
ment Program, but just as important, if not more importantly, that
learning, via the ITP Program, can now be leveraged across ten or
20,000 small and medium-sized manufacturers.

CHARGING INDUSTRY FOR ASSESSMENTS

Mr.  INGLIS.  Right.  And  as  I  understand  it,  the  program  has  two
parts. Right? I have just learned this from Elizabeth, but it has got
two parts. The R&D and then it has got the assessment part of it.
The R&D as currently used and in place seems to be a decent way
of  going,  that  the  Department  of  Energy  spends  money,  helps  cre-
ate the R&D, and develop new technology.

In the case of the assessment, why would the entity benefit if not
paid,  say  on  a  contingency  fee  basis,  to  the  DOE  for  the  assess-
ment?  In  other  words,  right  now  what  you  have,  right,  is  the
money,  and  Mr.  Kavanagh,  I  differ  with  you  about  the  definition
of corporate welfare there. What you just described is a subsidized
rate.  It  is  like  you  and  I  have  decided  to  go  out  to  dinner  tonight,
we are going to split the bill, and it is either that we go to Charlie
Palmer’s or we go to Burrito Brothers. And if Elizabeth is going to
pay,  we  are  going  to  Charlie  Palmer’s.  Even  if  I  am  putting  some
of the money in myself, right? Because I am going to get something
out of it. So it is a subsidized rate.

So  what  I  am  wondering  about  is  whether,  if  industry  X  out
there is going to benefit from this assessment, why not have money
flow back to DOE based on how much they saved to cause DOE to
become  a  profit  center.  I  am  into  profit.  To  have  the  DOE  become
a  profit  center  for  the  government.  We  could  actually  maybe  start
paying  for  things  that  DOE  does  by  what  we  collect  from  our  cus-
tomers that are served by the universities, they are achieving these
savings. Is there a problem with that?

Mr.  VERDICT.  Sir,  if  I  may  attempt  to  answer  that  question.  It
is a wonderful concept, and I think it provides maybe the right mo-
tivation  and  practicality  to  be  able  to  actually  add  a  monitoring
verification  component  to  the  Small  Industrial  Assessment  Pro-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:43 Feb 28, 2008 Jkt 037982 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\092507\37982 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

gram,  and  actually  verify  the  savings  like  companies  have  to  do
that are in a shared saving, performance savings arrangement. You
would  probably  drive  the  program  costs  out  of  existence.  It  barely
survives on being able to do these simple walk-throughs and these
quick returns.

So  I  think  you  would  end  up  spending  at  least  in  the  IAC  Pro-
gram  as  much  money  trying  to  verify  the  savings  as  the  company
would get back.

Mr. INGLIS. Well, I can see a problem. It would provide some em-
ployment  for  lawyers  as  well  as  scientists,  however,  which  would
be  helpful  as  a  lawyer,  but  I  can  see  that  as  a  challenge.  In  other
words you have to set up some definition. You have to have a con-
tract that sets up definitions about how much energy is being used
now and when you are going to measure it, and therefore, how you
are going to pay.

But I just wonder whether that would solve the Administration’s
concerns, which I assume are these things about corporate welfare,
that  you  actually  get  a  profit  model  going  and  truly  have  a  very
enlightened kind of partnership between government and industry.
Right? Where government can actually benefit.

Mr.  KAVANAGH.  You  have  to  get  down  to  another  level  of  detail.
I  don’t  really  agree  with  your  dinner  analogy,  and  I  will  try  to  ex-
plain why. Within the ITP Program we pick projects that serve the
government’s  goals  as  well  as  the  industries’  goals.  We  don’t  pick
projects that only benefit industry. There has got to be some public
good or benefit associated with success.

Mr.  INGLIS.  Well,  there  is  always  going  to  be  public  good  in  re-
ducing energy consumption, because we are all concerned about en-
ergy  security.  So  100  percent  of  the  projects  would  be  for  govern-
ment good.

Mr.  KAVANAGH.  Well,  that  defeats  the  corporate  welfare  argu-

ment, doesn’t it, because——

Mr. INGLIS. No.
Mr. KAVANAGH.—that justifies—should the DOE——
Mr. INGLIS. Because you could go——
Mr. KAVANAGH.—invest in projects for the public good?
Mr.  INGLIS.  Well,  it  doesn’t  necessarily  because  there  are  still
winners  and  losers.  If  you  have  an  unlimited  budget,  yeah,  then
you  would  have  everyone  in  industry  getting  that  benefit.  But  if
you have only some, then you have some benefiting and others not,
unless you have an infinite budget.

Mr.  KAVANAGH.  I  agree  with  you  there,  and  that  is  another  im-
portant  distinction.  I  can’t  speak  for  the  Industrial  Assessment
Center side, but on the R&D side, the projects are not undertaken
between  the  Department  of  Energy  and  one  company.  They  are
taken with a sector so the entire sector benefits, and that enhances
the  public  good  because  it  is  replicating  the  technology  throughout
a  part  of  the  industry,  and  at  the  same  time  all  of  that  sector  is
investing their own dollars as well. Okay.

So  it  is  like  you  and  I  are  going  out  to  dinner,  and  we  are  both
eating.  It  would  be  unfair  if  only  I  ate.  Okay.  So  that  is  kind  of
the way the program is set up, and in fact, in some of the programs
there is a repayment provision when you develop a technology that
is  commercially  successful,  okay,  the  companies  that  invested  and

took  the  risk  get  a  royalty-free  use  of  it,  just  like  the  government,
because  it  invested  and  took  a  risk.  But  if  there  is  another  com-
pany  out  there  that  was  not  an  investor,  okay,  and  the  technology
is commercially available, they have to pay a royalty to use it, and
that royalty then flows back into the treasury to help repay the in-
vestment.

Now,  that  works,  and  it  has  been  done,  but  you  know,  the  time
scale  that  we  are  talking  about  for  that  kind  of  dramatic  process
development takes 8 to 10 years. So it can get messy, which is why
some  projects  have  gone  away  from  the  repayment  provision.  But
in the steel industry we use it, and we are in favor of it.

Mr.  INGLIS.  My  time  is  well  up,  and  we  got  a  vote  on,  don’t  we?
Chairman LAMPSON. We do. We have a vote on. It is about seven
minutes  before  the  first  one.  There  is  a  total  of  three.  Five-minute
votes will follow the 15-minute vote, and I would personally like to
head  back.  If  you  all  can  be  patient  with  us  while  we  go  and  vote,
we will come back.

Mr. INGLIS. Keep going here if you want to. I mean, if you have,

how much time do you have?

Chairman LAMPSON. We have——
Mr. INGLIS. I am happy to yield back at this point.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Only  25  people  have  voted,  so  I  think  we
have  got  a  little  while,  but  let  me,  again,  let  me  try  to  go  through
these somewhat quickly, and if you will keep your answers as suc-
cinctly  as  you  possibly  can,  I  would  appreciate  it.  And  let  me  go
to Mr. Moore.

THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY IN THE U.S.

DOW’s  CEO  has  said  that  you  are  investing  heavily  outside  the
United  States.  Is  it  too  late  to  save  the  chemical  industry  in  the
United States?

Mr.  MOORE.  The  simple  answer  is  no,  but  let  me  add  a  little  bit

of background in-between.

Across  the  globe  there  have  been  19  world  scale  crackers.  These
are  big,  ethylene  conversion  assets  are  used  in  integrated  petro-
chemical  complexes  that  have  been  announced  to  be  built  in  the
next  decade.  Not  one  of  them  is  scheduled  to  be  built  in  the  U.S.
Then I go and I look at what Dow is doing. Dow is growing, and
it is growing globally, but it is not growing significantly in the U.S.
You can just look at our announced joint ventures with Saudi Ara-
bia,  with  Saudi  Aramco,  or  in  Kuwait  as  an  example.  And  we  are
growing  there  because  they  have  reliable  and  competitive-priced
fuel and feedstocks.

Now, chemical industry is not immediately at risk in the U.S. In
fact,  it  is  terribly  important  to  Dow  and  to  most  other  companies
that  operate  here.  In  fact,  50  percent  of  Dow’s  assets  are  still  in
the  U.S.  They  are  terribly  important.  They  are  critical  to  our  suc-
cess.

It  is  terribly  important  for  us  to  operate  them  both  effectively
and  efficiently,  and  as  I  noted  earlier,  the  importance  of  having  a
reliable  and  a  secure  and  a  competitive  price,  fuel  and  feedstock,
is ultimately tied to our long-term success here in the U.S.

NEED FOR CONTROL SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Cicio, there are numerous energy-inten-
sive  industries,  and  the  ITP  does  not  have  the  resources  to  focus
on  all  of  them.  So  in  your  opinion  where  can  ITP  have  the  largest
impact, the most bang for the buck?

Mr.  CICIO.  If  I  may,  when  I  polled  my  companies,  which  is  a
broad  cross  section  of  these  energy-intensive  industries,  it  was
pretty  unanimous  that  there  are  plenty  of  areas  that  almost  all
would benefit from. And this gets to the issue of control system im-
provements, optimization of steam generation. See, lots of manufac-
turers  use  steam  process  heaters,  heat  recovery  technology.  These
are  basic  types  of  technology  that  are  used  to  route  these  indus-
tries.

So  there  is  a  lot  of  room  for  focus  on  those  technologies  that

would benefit almost all of them.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Verdict,  talk  about  IAC  for
just  a  second.  Can  you  or  do  you  have  an  estimate  for  an  appro-
priate  level  of  funding  for  the  IAC  Program  to  meet  the  demand
that you describe?

Mr.  VERDICT.  I  think  at  the  minimum  it  needs  to  go  back  to
where  it  was  six  or  seven  years  ago,  but  I  think  there  are  addi-
tional  opportunities,  and  if  DOE  would  run  this  as  a  business
model,  then  they  would  actually  go  out  and  sample  the  demand.  I
think  they  are  going  to  find  there  is  tremendous  demand  there  for
this  product,  and  I  think  they  are  going  to  find  willing  partners
even  to  do  some  cost  sharing.  I  think  you  are  going  to  find  pro-
grams in many states where you have a very active and aggressive
utility funded programs to also be willing to work with the assess-
ment centers.

But we really had no guidance or no authorization to actually try
to  match  up  funding.  But  there  is  certainly,  just  indirectly  the  de-
mand is far greater than what the current funding levels are.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Well,  like  I  said  awhile  ago,  these  are  ex-
actly the things that I think this Science Committee needs to show
the  leadership  on  if  we  at  all  possibly  can.  I  put  our  country’s  re-
sources  into  things  that  give  us  back  significant  return.  Clearly
what  you  have  described  here  today  and  helped  us  understand  is
one of those areas.

Yes, sir.
Mr.  VERDICT.  If  I  could  just  add  one  thing  on  the  educational
benefit.  We  keep  talking  about  the  immediate  payback,  but  once
you train one of these energy engineers, and he stays out there, he
is continually working and improving the processes which he is in-
volved  in.  It  is  very,  very  hard  to  put  a  dollar  benefit  to  that,  but
we  say  we  were  going  to  add  3,000  in  the  program  over  some  31
years.  That  is  really  not  that  many  engineers.  We  really  have  got
to train a lot more engineers than that, and they are out there with
the first line of defense, with their computers and their meters, and
they  are  helping  save  energy,  and  I  think  that  is  the  right  thing
that some of our Government resources should be doing.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  I  totally  agree.  Thank  you  and  thank  you
all,  and  we  are  not  going  to  come  back  after  this  vote,  so  we  dis-
miss the panel. We thank you very, very much. Under the rules of

SECTION-BY-SECTION: DISCUSSION DRAFT

Industrial Energy Efficiency Act of 2007

Section 1. Short Title

‘‘The Industrial Energy Efficiency Act of 2007’’

Section 2. Findings

The  U.S.  Industrial  sector  accounts  for  more  energy  use  (32.2  percent)  than  the
residential,  commercial,  or  transportation  sectors.  Industries  have  almost  reached
optimal energy efficiencies and new innovations and technologies’ research, develop-
ment,  and  demonstration  are  necessary  to  increase  energy  efficiency  and  diversify
energy and feedstock sources.
Section 3. Industrial Technologies Program

Establishes  a  program  within  the  Department  of  Energy  to  work  with  energy-in-
tensive  industries,  industry  trade  associations,  and  institutions  of  higher  education
to conduct cost-shared research, development, demonstration, and commercial appli-
cation  activities  for  new  innovations  and  technologies  to  enhance  industrial  energy
efficiency,  environmental  performance  and  economic  competitiveness  of  U.S.  indus-
trial sector.

Defines  the  activities  of  the  program  to  include:  research  to  improve  the  quality
and  quantity  of  feedstocks  recovered  from  waste  streams;  to  develop  alternative  re-
sources  for  use  as  industrial  feedstocks;  developing  alternative  energy  sources  to
supply heat and power for energy-intensive industries.
Section 4. University-Based Industrial Research and Assessment Centers

Requires  the  Secretary  to  operate  university-based  Industrial  Research  and  As-
sessment  Centers  to  aid  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturers  by  identifying  op-
portunities  to  optimize  their  energy  efficiency  and  improve  environmental  perform-
ance, to serve as clearinghouses for technical assistance resources, and to train stu-
dents  to  conduct  energy  assessments,  and  to  conduct  educational  outreach  in  co-
operation  with  other  state-accredited  technical  training  centers  and  community  col-
leges.
Section 5. Authorization of Appropriations

Funding  is  authorized  from  FY  2009  through  2013  and  has  not  yet  been  deter-

mined.
