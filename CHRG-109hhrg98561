HEARING CHARTER

COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Improving the Nation’s Energy

Security: Can Cars and Trucks Be

Made More Fuel Efficient?

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2005

2:30 P.M.–4:30 P.M.

2318 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

Purpose

On  February  9,  the  Committee  on  Science  will  hold  a  hearing  on  the  availability
of technologies to improve fuel economy in cars and trucks and the potential for fuel
economy improvements to reduce the Nation’s dependence on foreign oil.

The  U.S.  depends  on  imports  to  meet  nearly  60  percent  of  its  oil  needs,  much  of
it  from  troubled  countries  or  regions  of  the  world,  including  Nigeria,  Venezuela,
Russia,  and  the  Middle  East.  The  gasoline  burned  by  cars  and  trucks  accounts  for
about  45  percent  of  the  Nation’s  oil  consumption.  Total  U.S.  daily  oil  consumption
is expected to rise from 20 million barrels today to 29 million barrels by 2025, most-
ly as a result of increasing consumption for transportation.

The  hearing  will  focus  on  the  pros  and  cons  of  tightening  federal  fuel  economy
standards for cars and light trucks (known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or
CAFE  standards)  and  reforming  the  program  as  a  way  to  reduce  U.S.  oil  consump-
tion and encourage the use of new technologies. But witnesses have also been asked
to  discuss  more  generally  how  the  Federal  Government  could  promote  the  deploy-
ment  of  fuel-saving  technologies.  Other  options  include  tax  incentives,  fuel  taxes,
and research, development and demonstration programs.

More specifically, the hearing will review and update the findings of the National
Academy of Sciences on CAFE standards issued in 2002. The Academy report, which
was  commissioned  by  the  Congress,  concluded  that  the  technology  exists  to  signifi-
cantly  improve  the  fuel  economy  of  cars  and  light  trucks  without  reducing  safety.
In  December,  the  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy,  a  bipartisan  group  of
leaders from business, government, and academia that included experts in national
security,  energy,  and  the  environment  released  a  set  of  recommendations  for  U.S.
energy policy. The recommendations included a call to raise CAFE standards to en-
hance the Nation’s energy security. The privately funded group was chaired by Wil-
liam  Reilly,  who  was  Administrator  of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)
under President George H.W. Bush, and John Holdren, the Teresa and John Heinz
Professor of Environmental Policy at Harvard University.

The  Committee  plans  to  explore  the  following  overarching  questions  at  the  hear-

ing:

1. To  what  extent  can  improving  fuel  economy  in  cars  and  trucks  improve  the

economic and energy security of the Nation?

2. What  technologies  are  available  or  will  soon  be  available  to  improve  fuel
economy in cars and trucks? How much could these technologies improve fuel
economy without compromising safety or the economy?

3. What  policy  options  are  available  to  Congress  to  encourage  the  adoption  of
automobile  efficiency  technologies?  What  are  the  advantages  and  disadvan-
tages of each?

Witnesses:
1. William  Reilly  co-chaired  the  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy,  which  in
December  released  a  report  entitled  Ending  the  Energy  Stalemate:  A  Bipartisan
Strategy  to  Meet  America’s  Energy  Challenges.  Mr.  Reilly  is  founding  partner  of
the  investment  firm  Aqua  International  Partners  and  was  the  Administrator  of
EPA under President George H.W. Bush.

which  authored  the  2002  report.  An  economist,  he  is  the  President  of  Resources
for the Future, a D.C.-based energy and environmental policy research institute.
3. K.G.  Duleep  is  Transportation  Managing  Director  of  the  energy  and  environ-
mental consulting firm Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. He is an inter-
nationally recognized expert on vehicular fuel economy and emissions issues. He
has  been  involved  with  automotive  technology,  fuel  economy,  and  emissions
issues for over 20 years.

4. Michael  Stanton  is  Vice  President  of  Government  Affairs  at  the  Alliance  of
Automobile  Manufacturers,  a  trade  association  representing  the  BMW  Group,
DaimlerChrysler,  Ford  Motor  Company,  General  Motors,  Mazda,  Mitsubishi  Mo-
tors, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

5. David  Greene  is  a  Corporate  Fellow  at  the  National  Transportation  Research
Center,  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory.  He  has  spent  25  years  researching
transportation and energy policy issues.

Issues:

• Has  the  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  law  worked?  Con-
gress  created  the  CAFE  program  in  1975  after  the  Arab  oil  embargo,  which
resulted  in  a  tripling  of  the  price  of  oil  in  the  early  1970s.  Average  new  car
fuel  economy  rose  from  12.9  miles  per  gallon  (mpg)  in  1974  to  27.6  mpg  in
1985—slightly more than the 27.5 mpg required by the CAFE standards that
year.  (The  average  for  new  light  trucks,  the  category  that  now  includes
pickups,  SUVs  and  mini-vans,  rose  to  19.5  mpg  over  the  same  time  period.)
Today,  the  standards  stand  at  27.5  mpg  for  cars  and  21.0  mpg  for  light
trucks.
Experts  argue  over  the  extent  to  which  the  increase  in  fuel  economy  in  the
1970s  and  1980s  can  be  attributed  to  CAFE  or  to  high  fuel  prices.  Some  say
that  the  sudden  hike  in  prices  in  the  1970s  and  the  threat  of  competition
from  Japanese  automakers  (who  were  entering  the  U.S.  market  with  more
fuel efficient cars) were the predominant forces driving the increase in domes-
tic fuel economy. But the National Academy of Sciences panel concluded that
CAFE standards have played a leading role in preventing fuel economy levels
from  dropping  as  much  as  they  otherwise  would  have  as  fuel  prices  declined
in the 1990s, and that fuel use by cars and trucks today is roughly one-third
lower than it would have been had fuel economy not improved since 1975.
Experts  also  argue  whether,  regardless  of  their  effectiveness,  CAFE  stand-
ards are the most efficient and effective way to increase fuel economy.

• Why has the fuel economy of new vehicles been on a downward trend
since  1987?  The  average  fuel  economy  of  new  vehicles  sold  in  the  U.S.  has
declined  since  reaching  a  peak  in  1987.  The  major  reason  is  the  explosive
growth in SUVs, mini-vans, and pickup trucks, which must meet a fuel econ-
omy standard that is lower than that for passenger cars. The number of light
trucks sold has more than tripled since 1980, while the number of passenger
cars  has  declined  slightly  over  the  same  period.  Today  more  than  half  the
new  cars  sold  are  light  trucks.  At  the  same  time,  CAFE  standards  have  re-
mained  stagnant.  The  fuel  economy  standard  for  new  cars  has  not  changed
since  1990.  And  until  this  year,  the  standard  for  new  light  trucks  had  not
changed since 1996.
The  fact  that  the  average  fuel  economy  has  declined  since  1987  does  not
mean  that  no  new  cars  or  light  trucks  use  newer,  more  fuel-efficient  tech-
nologies.  But  any  improvements  in  fuel  economy  in  a  particular  model  have
been offset by declines in fuel economy in other models (or by increased sales
of models with lower fuel economy), allowing the average—which is based on
sales of all makes and models—to drop. Proponents of CAFE standards argue
that  government  action  is  the  only  way  to  raise  the  average  by  pushing  im-
provements across automakers’ fleets.
Automakers  point  out  that  they  have  made  cars  and  trucks  more  efficient,
pound  for  pound,  in  recent  years.  They  note  that  they  have  significantly  in-
creased the power and size of vehicles without much change in fuel economy.
And  they  argue  that  customers  prefer  power,  size  and  luxury  over  fuel  effi-

ciency. As a result, average vehicle weight has increased by 24 percent since
1981 and average horsepower has increased by 93 percent.

• Does  the  technology  exist  to  improve  the  fuel  economy  of  cars  and
trucks?  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report  identified  14  technologies
that were readily available in 2002 to improve the efficiency of automotive en-
gines, transmissions, and overall design (such as a vehicle’s aerodynamics and
rolling  resistance).  The  Academy  also  identified  nine  emerging  technologies,
some of which had already been introduced in European or Japanese markets,
but not in the U.S.
The  Academy  concluded  that  the  technologies  it  identified,  in  combination,
would allow fuel economy increases of 12 to 27 percent for cars and 25 to 42
percent  for  light  trucks  without  any  reduction  of  safety.  (The  technologies
would  also  pay  for  themselves  in  fuel  savings,  the  Academy  found.  See  at-
tachment.)
The Academy did not include hybrid vehicles among the technologies it iden-
tified because they had just been introduced into the American market when
the  Academy  conducted  its  study.  Sales  of  hybrids  have  continued  to  grow
since  the  Academy  issued  its  report.  The  National  Commission  on  Energy
Policy  report,  released  late  last  year,  found  that  the  ability  of  hybrid  tech-
nologies  to  make  substantial  improvements  in  fuel  economy  has  been  clearly
demonstrated.
Automakers  question  whether  consumers  will  be  willing  to  pay  for  efficiency
technologies.  Even  if  the  technology  pays  for  itself  in  gasoline  savings  over
the life of the vehicle, they say, many consumers do not consider those kinds
of long-term benefits when choosing a vehicle.

• Can fuel economy be improved without eroding passenger safety? The
relationship  between  fuel  economy  and  safety  is  fiercely  debated.  Even  the
National Academy of Sciences panel was split on this issue. A majority found
that  when  automakers  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  made  vehicles  more  efficient
by  making  them  smaller  and  lighter,  they  also  likely  increased  the  number
of crash fatalities by several percent. (Two members of the panel believed the
relationship between weight, size and safety to be too uncertain to determine
whether any additional casualties occurred due to fuel economy improvements
during that time.)
The  Academy  panel  concluded  unanimously,  however,  that  fuel  economy
could  be  increased  in  the  future  without  any  detriment  to  safety.  The  Acad-
emy  said  that  the  technologies  it  had  identified  for  improving  fuel  economy
would  not  reduce  safety  and  could  even  increase  it.  The  panel  also  called  for
a  reduction  in  the  weight  of  the  heaviest  vehicles  in  the  light  truck  category
as  a  way  to  increase  safety  and  fuel  economy  simultaneously.  The  Academy
found  that  if  the  weight  and  size  of  the  heaviest  vehicles,  particularly  those
over  4,000  pounds,  were  reduced,  vehicle  safety  would  improve  by  reducing
the damage caused by those vehicles in crashes.

• Would  raising  fuel  economy  standards  disadvantage  domestic  manu-
facturers?  The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  report  concluded  that  CAFE
regulations  could  have  different  effects  on  different  manufacturers,  but  that
those effects could be minimized. The sales and especially the profits of Gen-
eral  Motors,  Ford,  and  the  Chrysler  division  of  DaimlerChrysler,  are  much
more  dependent  on  light  trucks  than  are  their  competitors.  If  fuel  economy
standards were raised for light trucks, but not for cars, U.S.-based companies
would  likely  suffer.  (This  assumes  that  redesigning  light  trucks  to  improve
fuel  economy  would  either  raise  the  prices  of  the  vehicles,  driving  customers
away,  or  require  automakers  to  absorb  some  of  the  costs  of  redesign,  eating
into  profits.)  Conversely,  if  standards  were  raised  for  cars  only,  U.S.-based
companies  might  be  advantaged.  But  fuel  economy  increases  in  light  trucks
would produce greater oil savings.
To minimize the costs of improving fuel economy, both the National Academy
of  Sciences  and  the  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy  recommended  re-
forming CAFE regulations to allow manufacturers to trade fuel economy cred-
its with one another in much the same way that electric utilities trade pollu-
tion  allowances.  Under  such  a  system,  an  automaker  that  could  not  improve
its  average  fuel  economy  to  the  extent  required  by  CAFE  standards  could
purchase  credits  from  an  automaker  that  had  exceeded  CAFE  standards.
(The  government  could  also  sell  credits.)  Tradable  CAFE  credits  would  give

6

manufacturers an incentive to exceed the standards since they could then sell
the  credits  to  others.  And  it  could  minimize  the  overall  cost  of  the  program
by ensuring that the auto industry as a whole made the most economical im-
provements in fuel economy.
Even  under  a  CAFE  program  that  allowed  tradable  credits,  however,  domes-
tic  automakers,  which  sell  the  largest  and  least  fuel  efficient  vehicles,  would
likely have to invest the most, either in purchasing credits from other manu-
facturers or in developing fuel efficient technologies.
That  is  one  reason  why  the  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy  further
recommended  that  an  increase  in  CAFE  standards  be  coupled  with  a  tax  in-
centive  program  to  encourage  the  domestic  production  of  vehicles  with  fuel
efficient technologies like hybrid and diesel technologies.
The  Academy  also  recommended  that  Congress  eliminate  the  separate  cat-
egories for cars and light trucks. That would enable CAFE standards to allow
automakers more flexibility because they could meet a single CAFE standard
for  their  entire  fleet  in  more  ways.  An  automaker  could  choose  to  meet  a
tighter  CAFE  standard  either  by  improving  the  fuel  mileage  of  cars  or  light
trucks  or  both.  However,  eliminating  the  current  categories  would  likely  se-
verely  disadvantage  U.S.-based  automakers  because  their  fleets  are  so
weighted toward light trucks that the bulk of any fuel economy improvements
would still have to be made in that class of vehicles. However, new categories
based on weight, size or horsepower, might go a long way toward leveling the
playing field.

• How  would  higher  fuel  economy  standards  likely  affect  workers  in
the automotive industry? The National Academy of Sciences panel believed
that  fuel  economy  standards  could  be  raised  without  negative  consequences
on  employment  if  the  increase  were  implemented  with  enough  lead-time.
Even  existing  technologies,  the  report  said,  could  take  four  to  eight  years  to
penetrate the market.
The  Academy  panel  pointed  out,  however,  that  larger  scale  trends  have  a
much greater effect on employment than do CAFE standards. Employment in
the auto industry increased from little over 600 million in the early 1980s to
over  one  million  in  1999,  largely  because  of  foreign-owned  companies’  deci-
sions  to  build  manufacturing  plants  in  the  U.S.  Over  the  same  time  period,
however, organized labor lost almost half of its members due to the domestic
manufacturers’  improvements  in  automobile  production,  shifts  of  parts  pro-
duction  overseas,  and  loss  of  market  share  to  foreign-owned  manufacturers.
(Workers in their plants, even those in the U.S., generally are not unionized.)
The  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy  argued  that  its  recommendation
for  tax  incentives  for  the  domestic  production  of  hybrid  and  diesel  vehicles
would  help  staunch  this  flow.  The  Commission  argued  that  some  jobs  would
be  lost  in  any  event  as  foreign  manufacturers  expand  their  efforts  to  intro-
duce hybrid and diesel vehicles in the U.S. market. But the Commission cal-
culated  that  its  tax  incentives  would  result  in  about  25  percent  fewer  jobs
being lost.

• How  much  oil  would  an  increase  in  fuel  economy  save?  According  to
the National Commission on Energy Policy, improving car and light truck fuel
economy by 10, 15, and 20 percent by 2015 would result, by 2025, in an esti-
mated fuel savings of approximately two, three, and 3.5 million barrels of oil
a day respectively. Such savings represent a 25 to 40 percent reduction in the
additional amount of oil by which U.S. demand is currently projected to grow
by that time, absent other policy interventions.

Background:
Origins of the CAFE Program

The early 1970s saw the price of oil triple, an increase precipitated by an embargo
orchestrated  by  the  oil  cartel  OPEC  (Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Coun-
tries).  The  crisis  threw  into  stark  relief  the  fuel  inefficiency  of  U.S.  manufactured
automobiles, and consumers began switching to relatively fuel efficient imported ve-
hicles.  Congress  passed  the  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  in  1975  with  the
goal  of  reducing  the  Nation’s  dependence  on  foreign  oil,  which  established,  among
other things, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program to raise the fuel
economy of the U.S. fleet.

The  CAFE  program  requires  the  fuel  economy  of  an  automaker’s  entire  product
line of cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., averaged across all models and weight-
ed by sales, to meet a miles-per-gallon level set by the government. Under the 1975
law,  Congress  sets  the  target  for  passenger  cars,  which  rose  from  18  mpg  in  1978
to  27.5  mpg  in  1990,  where  it  remains  today.  Congress  delegated  the  authority  to
set fuel economy standards for light trucks to the National Highway Transportation
Safety Administration (NHTSA). Light truck standards rose from 17.5 mpg in 1982
to  20.7  mpg  in  1996.  Beginning  this  year,  the  standard  for  light  trucks  is  to  rise
gradually to 22.2 mpg in 2007. The increase this year is the first since 1996, in part,
because  language  added  to  appropriations  bills  forbade  NHTSA  from  raising  the
standard between 1996 and 2000.

When  Congress  created  the  CAFE  program,  light  trucks  accounted  for  a  small
portion of vehicle sales and generally included trucks used on farms or at construc-
tion sites. According to the Congressional Research Service, the number of new pas-
senger  cars  sold  each  year  in  the  U.S.  has  decreased  somewhat  since  1980,  but  the
number  of  light  trucks  sold  has  more  than  tripled,  from  2.2  million  in  1980  to  8.7
million in 2001.

Domestic manufacturers still dominate the light truck market, but their share has
declined  from  86  percent  in  1993  to  less  than  77  percent  in  2002  as  foreign  auto-
makers  have  aggressively  targeted  this  popular  sector  of  the  U.S.  market,  focusing
on somewhat smaller, more fuel efficient models.
Recent Actions

In  2003  NHTSA  issued  a  final  rule  to  boost  the  CAFE  standard  for  light  trucks
by  1.5  miles  per  gallon  by  2007.  NHTSA  estimates  that  the  increase  will  save  ap-
proximately 75,000 barrels of oil a day between 2006 and 2012, or less than 0.4 per-
cent of current consumption.

In 2003 NHTSA also issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule-making inviting
comments  on  a  wide  variety  of  potential  ways  to  change  the  CAFE  program  to  ad-
dress a number of criticisms that have been made, including those made by the Na-
tional  Academy  of  Sciences  panel.  For  example,  NHTSA  has  invited  comments  on
whether  it  ought  to  discard  the  distinction  the  program  makes  between  cars  and
light  trucks  (which  would  require  a  statutory  change);  establish  separate  fuel  econ-
omy  standards  for  various  classes  of  light  trucks  based  on  weight,  size,  or  some
other  attribute;  or  extend  fuel  economy  standards  to  light  trucks  weighing  up  to
10,000 pounds (since such vehicles are currently not subject to fuel economy stand-
ards).  NHTSA  has  set  no  date  for  when  it  might  propose  actual  reforms  based  on
these comments.
Questions Asked of the Witnesses:

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  want  to  welcome  everyone  here  for  this

important hearing on fuel economy.

This  committee  has  a  special  responsibility  to  review  this  issue,
because  part  of  our  charge  is  to  ensure  that  new  energy  tech-
nologies are developed and that they make their way into the mar-
ketplace.

And  new  fuel  economy  technologies  are  not  making  their  way
into  the  market,  at  least  not  to  an  acceptable  extent  because  of
market failures and, quite frankly, political failures.

Correcting  those  failures  should  be  of  surpassing  interest  to
every citizen of our country, because fuel economy is not just an en-
ergy  issue,  it  is  not  just  an  environmental  issue,  it  is,  first  and
foremost, a national security issue.

Our nation is ever more dependent, stunningly dependent on the
world’s  most  unstable  region  for  the  energy  that  is  the  lifeblood  of
our  economy.  Could  anything  be  more  critical?  We  are  like  a  pa-
tient  in  critical  care  who  needs  a  daily  transfusion  and  can  only
hope to get it from an iffy, black market supplier.

And  yet  we  act  as  if  everything  will  be  healthy  forever.  We  are
doing  next  to  nothing  to  reduce  our  reliance  on  foreign  oil.  About
60  percent  of  the  oil  we  consume  each  day  is  used  for  transpor-
tation; 45 percent of it is just for cars and light trucks. We can not
reduce  our  oil  consumption  meaningfully  unless  we  address  trans-
portation. That is a simple, unarguable fact.

And yet while many areas of the economy have been significantly
more energy efficient over the past three decades or so, our nation’s
fuel  economy  is  worse  than  it  was  15  years  ago.  That  ought  to  be
unacceptable.

It  ought  to  be  especially  unacceptable,  intolerable,  really,  when
we  have  the  technology  to  improve  fuel  economy  without  reducing
safety, without harming the economy, and without reducing the op-
tions people have in the automobile showroom.

I  think  we  will  learn  today  that  there  really  is  no  debate  about
whether we have the technology we need to improve fuel economy.
The  only  debate  is  whether  we  are  willing  to  do  something  about
it, and that we will hear more of today.

But while we listen to the experts before us today, I want every-
one to remember the costs of inaction: they can be measured in dol-
lars, particularly in the funds we spend on the military and home-
land  security,  and  they  can  also  be  measured  in  lives,  as  we  can
see  in  daily  news  reports.  We  need  to  consider  the  very  real  costs
of  being  utterly  dependent  on  unstable  regions  to  carry  out  our
most basic daily tasks.

I  am  not  arguing,  by  the  way,  that  we  can  become  entirely  en-
ergy independent or that fuel economy is the sole answer to our en-
ergy  woes.  That  would  be  silly.  We  will  markup  a  bill  tomorrow
that  reflects  the  full  range  of  steps  we  need  to  take  in  energy  re-
search and development to improve our energy profile, and they in-
volve  work  on  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy,  but  also  on
fossil  fuels  and  nuclear  energy;  and  they  involve  supply  as  well  as
demand.

But  we  ought  to  do  everything  we  can  to  reduce  our  demand.
That is in our national interest. It is an interest we share as a soci-
ety, but one that is not reflected adequately in individual decisions

in  the  marketplace,  a  classic  market  failure  that  cries  out  for  cor-
rective government action. But the government has not risen to the
task, and we are all in greater danger as a result.

We  have  a  very  distinguished  and  balanced  panel  of  experts  be-
fore  us.  I  am  especially  gratified  that  my  old  friend,  former  EPA
Administrator Bill Reilly is here to tell us the results of the bipar-
tisan study he co-chaired. Mr. Administrator, welcome.

And  I  am  also  very  pleased  to  have  Paul  Portney  with  us  to  re-
view  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  study  that  was  requested
by  Congress  and  that  should  be  the  foundation  for  any  discussion
of  CAFE  standards.  Unfortunately,  the  Academy  study  was  re-
leased  right  as  the  Energy  Bill  debate  was  starting  4  years  ago,
and  it  never  received  the  full  and  fair  airing  it  deserved.  Today,
with a new Energy Bill debate pending, we have a chance to make
up for our previous missed opportunities.

In  my  view,  we  need  more  stringent  CAFE  standards,  and  we
need  them  now,  for  the  reasons  I  have  discussed.  But  the  exact
level  and  timing  of  the  standards  and  how  the  CAFE  program
should be administered, that is all up for grabs, and I hope we can
have a full discussion of those issues today. I look forward to hear-
ing  from  our  panel.  And  I  thank  them  all  for  being  witnesses  and
sharing their expertise with us.

Mr. Gordon.

Mr. Gordon.
Mr. GORDON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you pointed out, the
topic  that  we  are  here  to  discuss  today  is  very  important  on  many
levels.  Energy  security  is  now  synonymous  with  national  security.
The  U.S.  uses  a  quarter  of  the  world’s  oil  and  over  60  percent  of
that  oil  is  imported,  primarily  from  unreliable  and  politically  un-
stable  regions  of  the  world.  The  slightest  movement  in  the  energy
markets can have substantial impacts on our economy. That is not
to  mention  the  disastrous  effect  that  it  might  have  on  the  disrup-
tion of oil supply around the world.

While reserving judgment on any one solution, I am appreciative
of  you  for  having  this  hearing  and  look  forward  to  learning  more.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BART GORDON

Thank  you  Mr.  Chairman  for  holding  this  hearing  today  on  an  issue  that  is  par-
ticularly  important  given  the  flurry  of  activity  in  Congress  on  energy  legislation.  It
appears  that  we  will  see  a  House  energy  bill  on  the  Floor  very  soon  and  I  look  for-
ward to tomorrow’s markup of the Science Committee’s contributions.

The topic we’re here to discuss today is important on many levels. Energy security
is  now  synonymous  with  national  security.  The  U.S.  uses  a  quarter  of  the  world’s
oil and over 60 percent of that oil is imported, primarily from unreliable and politi-
cally unstable regions of the world.

The  slightest  movements  in  energy  markets  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  the
economy.  That’s  not  to  mention  the  disastrous  effect  that  a  major  disruption  in  oil
supply  would  have  on  the  world,  but  most  especially  the  U.S.  While  we  do  use  oil
for  a  variety  of  industrial  and  heating  purposes,  about  80  percent  goes  into  the
transportation sector, and almost half of the oil we consume goes into cars and light
trucks—moms  taking  kids  to  soccer  practice  and  suburban  commuters  driving  to
work.

This thirst for oil comes at a price. Not only is it a weak link in our national secu-
rity  chain,  but  the  harmful  health  effects  of  air  pollution  from  fossil  fuel  use  are
yet to be fully understood. I don’t believe anyone would argue that we can continue
at  our  present  rate  of  oil  consumption,  but  the  steps  we  take  must  be  very  cal-
culated.  CAFE  standards  were  responsible  for  successfully  doubling  the  fuel  econ-
omy in the 1980’s, but those too can have unforeseen economic repercussions.

We should take care that, in our quest to lessen our dependence on oil, we do not
put  excess  burden  on  the  industries  that  have  made  this  economy  what  it  is  today.

While  reserving  judgment  on  any  one  solution,  I  welcome  the  discussion  today  of
mechanisms  such  as  tax  incentives,  tradable  CAFE  credits,  re-categorization  of  car
and light truck standards, and weight-based reclassifications schemes.

If  increasing  of  CAFE  standards  is  inevitable,  as  many  believe  it  is  and  should
be,  we  should  recognize  both  the  limitations  and  the  technological  achievements  of
individual  automakers.  In  this  regard,  some  companies  perform  better  than  others.
The  Union  of  Concerned  Scientists’  ranking  of  automakers  by  pollution  impact
places Honda and Nissan at the top of the list.

Nissan, for example, produces the Pathfinder SUV in my district. Despite not hav-
ing a hybrid gas-electric vehicle on the market, it has surpassed Toyota in the UCS
rankings  I  spoke  of.  Even  while  transforming  itself  into  a  full-line  automaker,  Nis-
san  is  incorporating  a  suite  of  existing  cutting  edge  technologies,  such  as  Continu-
ously Variable Transmission, to increase their overall fleet fuel economy. This hints
at  how  complex  the  range  of  CAFE-related  technology  options  can  be  for  auto-
makers.

And there is an army of scientists and researchers outside of the auto companies,
discovering  ways  to  revolutionize  the  transportation  sector  with  fuel  efficient  tech-
nologies.  For  example,  Dr.  Cliff  Ricketts  at  Middle  Tennessee  State  University  has
transformed a standard Nissan pickup truck into an emissions free alternative fuel
electric-hybrid vehicle.

I  would  like  to  thank  the  witnesses  for  coming  to  Washington  to  testify  on  tech-
nologies supporting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy of cars and trucks. Thank
you again, Mr. Chairman for this important hearing.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Gordon. And all
Members  will  have  the  opportunity  to  have  their  statements  in-
serted in the record at this juncture.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Good afternoon. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before our committee
to  examine  available  technologies  to  improve  the  fuel  economy  in  cars  and  trucks,
while also working towards reducing the Nation’s dependence on foreign oil.

Congress  passed  the  Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  in  1975,  with  a  goal  to
reduce  the  Nation’s  dependence  on  foreign  oil.  As  a  result,  the  Corporate  Average
Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  program  raised  the  fuel  economy  of  the  U.S.  fleet,  hoping
that  Congress’s  objective  would  be  met.  Thirty  years  later,  we  are  still  working  to-
wards  achieving  this  goal.  Today  we  depend  on  imports  to  meet  nearly  60  percent
of  our  oil  needs.  Gasoline  burned  by  cars  alone,  constitutes  about  45  percent  of  the
Nation’s  oil  consumption.  Looking  towards  the  future,  in  2025,  it  is  projected  that
the  U.S.  will  consume  29  million  barrels  of  oil  a  day,  mostly  on  transportation.  Ac-
cording to the National Commission on Energy Policy, improving car and light truck
fuel  economy  by  10,  15,  and  20  percent  by  2015  would  result,  by  2025,  in  an  esti-
mated  fuel  savings  of  approximately  up  to  3.5  million  barrels  of  oil  a  day.  At  the
same time, there are good arguments as to why we need to approach any new CAFE
standards  carefully.  If  we  have  the  technology  today  to  significantly  improve  the
fuel  economy  of  cars  and  light  trucks,  without  reducing  safety,  we  must  balance
these  advancements  in  a  way  that  does  not  place  constrictive  regulations  on  the
automotive industry, causing them to suffer economically. I am pleased to learn that
a National Commission on Energy Policy report from last year found that the ability
of  hybrid  technologies  to  make  substantial  improvements  in  fuel  economy  has  been
clearly demonstrated.

As we look for ways to reduce our foreign dependence on foreign oil and rely more
on  other  domestic  energy  sources,  such  as  coal,  hydrogen,  and  ethanol  it  is  critical
that  we  utilize  the  technological  advancements  we  have  today  to  improve  fuel  effi-
ciency,  without  disregarding  the  legitimate  concerns  of  the  workers  in  the  auto-
motive industry.

I look forward to hearing from our panel of witnesses.

Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  [CAFE]  standards  were  enacted  into  law  by
Congress  in  1975  as  a  part  of  the  ‘‘Energy  Policy  Conservation  Act,’’  [EPCA].  This
Act, passed in response to the 1973–74 Arab oil embargo, was established to double
new car fuel economy for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 1985.

It has been stated that raising CAFE stands could potentially save more oil than
our Persian Gulf imports, thereby reducing our dependency on Mid-Eastern imports
and also curb global warming.

Unfortunately,  some  theorize  that  making  cars  more  fuel  efficient  will  lead  to
greater safety concerns, reduced American auto choices and a loss of American Auto
job to overseas plants.

Everyday we, as Members of Congress, must make tough choice as to how we deal
with  the  issues  such  as  the  protection  of  our  environment  (this  is  the  only  planet
we  have)  and  the  safety  of  our  highways.  The  responsibility  of  weighing  the  pros
and cons of every can be a life or death matter.

Hopefully  our  witness  here  today  can  clear  up  these  issues.  We  appreciate  your

input.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL M. HONDA

I  commend  Chairman  Boehlert  and  Ranking  Member  Gordon  for  convening  this

hearing on fuel economy.

I  continue  to  be  amazed  by  the  response  of  many  people  in  this  country  to  the
prospect  of  conserving  energy.  We  know  that  fossil  fuel  supplies  both  here  and
abroad  are  limited—they  are  fossil  fuels,  remnants  from  biological  processes  that
took  place  centuries  ago  but  which  are  not  occurring  now.  These  fuels  will  run  out
eventually.  There  may  be  legitimate  debate  about  exactly  when  that  will  happen,
but the fact is that they will run out.

Since  our  nation  is  nearly  completely  dependent  on  a  finite  source  of  energy,  it
seems  to  me  that  what  we  need  to  do  in  the  short-term  is  reduce  our  levels  of  con-
sumption  of  our  finite  energy  supplies  to  make  them  last  longer,  and  for  the  long-
term, develop renewable sources of energy to meet our future needs.

But in complete opposition to common sense, Vice President Cheney has indicated
that conservation is a ‘‘personal virtue,’’ but not a sufficient basis for a sound energy
policy. I might almost be convinced to buy into this if reducing energy consumption
meant everyone had to stay at home, in the dark, either too cold or too hot depend-
ing  on  where  they  live.  But  that  is  not  necessary.  We  have  the  technologies  avail-
able  to  us  to  day  to  reduce  energy  consumption  in  our  vehicles,  in  our  homes,  and
in our offices, but because there is an up-front cost associated with these new tech-
nologies,  their  adoption  has  been  stalled.  No  one  factors  in  the  long-term  costs  to
public health and our environment of not being energy efficient, though. If they did,
economics could be the driver. But instead, we need something else to encourage ef-
ficiency.

CAFE  standards  are  an  excellent  way  of  improving  fuel  economy  in  vehicles.  By
requiring  vehicles  to  be  efficient,  the  government  can  stand  up  for  the  long-term
health of our nation and planet. Standards have not increased over the years, how-
ever, because of industry insistence that increased standards would make U.S. man-
ufacturers less competitive and would make vehicles less safe.

I  am  glad  that  we  are  having  this  hearing  today  so  we  can  learn  about  existing
technologies that can increase fuel economy, and strategies for implementing higher
standards that would not compromise the safety of our vehicles. I believe it is essen-
tial  for  our  national  security  to  take  all  steps  we  can  to  reduce  our  consumption  of
fossil fuels.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE RUSS CARNAHAN

Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the initiative to hold this important hearing
on  improving  automobile  fuel  efficiency  technologies  and  considering  raising  CAFE
standards.  We  are  lucky  to  have  a  leader  that  recognizes  the  role  that  new  tech-
nologies play in securing our nation, bringing us closer to energy independence and
protecting our environment.

There  is  clearly  a  benefit  to  introducing  new  technologies  to  increase  fuel  effi-
ciency.  I  am  most  curious  in  hearing  today  what  policy  options  are  available  to  us
to take these important steps forward.

I look forward, in particular, to Mr. Stanton’s testimony and hope to gain a better
understanding of how the auto industry feels about potential policy options. It is my

hope  that  Congress  can  not  only  work  with  the  industry  and  energy  providers,  but
also incorporate the opinions of auto workers and citizens concerned about the envi-
ronment who also have a strong interest in our policy decisions.

Chrysler  is  an  important  employer  to  our  region.  I  am  proud  to  have  a  strong
American auto manufacturer in the midst of my district and also to represent many
of the plant’s hardworking Americans.

I  urge  everyone  to  pay  particular  attention  to  balancing  the  increase  of  CAFE

standards while keeping our American auto companies strong and viable.

I  look  forward  to  hearing  the  testimony  of  the  panelists.  Thank  you  very  much

for being here today.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Jackson Lee follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

Chairman Boehlert, Ranking Member Gordon,

I want to thank you for organizing this important hearing on fuel efficiency stand-
ards  for  cars  and  light  trucks.  As  we  prepare  to  discuss  the  Energy  Bill,  we  all  ap-
preciate  the  importance  of  energy  efficiency  as  an  essential  component  of  the  poli-
cies that affect our nation’s economy and security. The Department of Energy’s En-
ergy  Information  Agency  (EIA)  reports  that  since  1985,  the  transportation  sector’s
consumption  of  primary  energy  sources  has  been  second  only  to  the  energy  con-
sumption  used  for  electric  generation.  Between  2001  and  2004,  light  duty  vehicles
consumed  nearly  60  percent  of  the  primary  energy  sources  used  for  transportation.
Clearly,  effective  national  policies  to  control  the  consumption  of  fuel  used  by  light
duty vehicles would have a significant positive impact on the Nation. Over the past
three  decades,  national  policies  for  vehicle  fuel  efficiency  have  included  both  regu-
latory and ‘‘technology-push’’ approaches.

In  response  to  the  then-restricted  world  supply  of  oil,  the  Congress  enacted  the
Energy  Policy  and  Conservation  Act  of  1975,  which  was  intended,  among  other
things,  to  induce  automobile  manufacturers  to  improve  the  fuel  economy  of  their
cars. The Act set a Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard for passenger
cars  that  increased  several  times  and  then  leveled  off  at  27.5  miles  per  gallon  for
model years 1985 and beyond.

Congress  authorized  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration
(NHTSA)  to  raise  or  lower  the  standard  for  a  particular  model  year  in  order  to
achieve  the  ‘‘maximum  feasible  average  fuel  economy,’’  taking  into  account  techno-
logical feasibility, economic feasibility, the effect upon fuel economy of other federal
motor vehicle standards, and the need of the Nation to conserve energy.

CAFE  standards  are  calculated  separately  for  a  manufacturer’s  domestic  and  im-
port car fleet. In 1988 the NHTSA was concerned that the 27.5 mpg standard might
lead  American  automobile  manufacturers  to  shift  some  of  their  large-car  manufac-
turing overseas in order to average the fuel economy of those cars with more of their
small  cars,  thereby  raising  the  average  fuel  economy  of  their  domestic  fleets  and
lowering the comfortably high average fuel economy of their non-domestic fleets.

The  possible  shift  of  large  car  manufacturing  to  off-shore  plants  raised  concerns
of  domestic  job  losses.  Anticipating  possible  job  losses  and  ‘‘potential  economic
harm,’’ the NHTSA lowered the CAFE standard in 1988 for MY 1989 from 27.5 mpg
to  26.5  mpg.  In  1989,  however,  the  agency  terminated  the  MY  1990  aspect  of  the
rule-making without changing the CAFE standard for that year based on the agen-
cy’s conclusion that retention of the 27.5 mpg standard for MY 1990 not have a sig-
nificant  adverse  effect  on  U.S.  employment  or  on  the  competitiveness  of  the  U.S.
auto industry.

CAFE  standards  affect  manufacturers  differently.  Those  with  full  product  lines
will be burdened more than manufacturers specializing in small to medium size ve-
hicles. Policy analysts may argue that would force the marketing of smaller cars as
they  believe  CAFE  intends.  However,  this  ignores  the  engineering  differences  be-
tween  some  large  and  small  cars.  For  example,  Ford’s  Crown  Victoria  is  one  of  the
few cars now sold that built as a ‘‘body on frame’’ design—in contrast to the unibody
construction  used  on  virtually  all  small  to  medium  size  cars.  ‘‘Body  on  frame’’  de-
signs  are  inherently  heavier  than  unibody  construction,  but  the  durability  this  pro-
vides  under  harsh  driving  conditions  makes  ‘‘body  on  frame’’  the  preferred  vehicle
design for police cars and taxicabs.

In  addition  to  the  distinction  that  CAFE  makes  between  domestic  and  imported
passenger  cars,  there  is  also  separate  classification  for  light  duty  trucks,  whose
standards  are  set  by  the  NHTSA  rather  than  by  statute.  The  present  standard  for
light  duty  trucks  is  20.7  miles  per  gallon.  The  determination  about  what  is  consid-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

16

ered  a  car  or  a  truck  can  be  confusing—some  of  the  NHTSA  and  EPA  regulations
define  certain  kinds  of  trucks  as  those  vehicles  that  look  similar  to  a  1977  Jeep  or
a 1977 Land Cruiser,1 with ‘trucks’ generally defined as those vehicles having a flat
cargo  floor.  Thus,  the  regulatory  scheme  allows  for  the  classification  of  the  Dodge
Neon  as  a  compact  car  and  the  Chrysler  PT  Cruiser  as  a  truck  for  the  purposes  of
fuel  economy  standards  even  though  both  are  built  on  the  same  vehicle  platform.
In addition to mandatory vehicle fuel economy standards specified in federal laws
and  regulations,  Congress  and  the  Executive  Branch  have  supported  research  pro-
grams  to  develop  new  technologies  intended  to  enable  the  development  of  vehicles
with increased fuel economy or reduced emissions.

Beginning  in  1991,  the  Department  of  Energy  partnered  with  the  domestic  car
companies  and  electric  utilities  to  form  the  U.S.  Advanced  Battery  Consortium
(USABC), a research and development initiative to develop batteries that would en-
able the deployment of practical electric cars. In 1993, a number of federal agencies
led  by  the  Department  of  Commerce  again  joined  Detroit’s  Big-3  to  form  the  Part-
nership  for  a  New  Generation  of  Vehicles  (PNGV)  to  build  prototype  five-passenger
vehicles  capable  of  80  MPG  fuel  economy.  In  2000,  the  Department  of  Energy  led
‘‘21st  Century  Truck,’’  a  government-industry  partnership  in  the  development  of
technologies  to  enable  more  fuel  efficient  large  trucks.  In  2002,  the  Department  of
Energy,  DaimlerChrysler,  Ford,  and  General  Motors  created  ‘‘FreedomCAR,’’  a  re-
search  initiative  to  develop  technologies  to  enable  petroleum-free  cars  and  light
trucks. Federal funding for these initiatives range from hundreds of millions of dol-
lars for USABC to several billions of dollars for PNGV and FreedomCAR.

Both of these approaches have had mixed results. Some will argue that CAFE has
shifted the market for family-sized vehicles away from station wagons to the some-
what heavier and less aerodynamic mini-vans, sport utility vehicles, and ‘‘king cab’’
pick-up  trucks.  U.S.-funded  ‘‘technology  push’’  initiatives  need  also  to  be  evaluated
against privately-funded vehicle development programs in Japan that have deployed
the  first  three  hybrid  electric  vehicle  models  commercially  sold  in  the  U.S.,  Asia,
and Europe.

The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  studied  the  issue  of  increasing  vehicle  fuel
economy in considerable detail. While finding that the CAFE regulations were effec-
tive  in  maintaining  fleet  fuel  economy  above  what  it  would  have  been  with  falling
gasoline prices in the early 1980s, the Academies noted that ‘‘there is a marked in-
consistency  between  pressing  automotive  manufacturers  for  improved  fuel  economy
from  new  vehicles  on  the  one  hand  and  insisting  on  low  real  gasoline  prices  on  the
other.’’  The  Academies’  study  included  ‘‘cost  efficient’’  analyses  to  illustrate  how  ra-
tional  consumers  will  balance  fuel  cost  savings  with  the  added  expenses  associated
with fuel saving technologies in the selection of the vehicles they buy and how many
miles  they  drive—analyses  that  are  not  considered  by  either  regulatory  or  tech-
nology-push  approaches.  The  National  Academies  also  addressed  demand  reduction
policies—including  gasoline  taxes,  carbon  taxes,  and  carbon  cap-and-trade  systems.
These  approaches  do  address  consumer  demand  for  fuel,  but  many  have  criticized
these approaches for a variety of reasons, including they have the characteristics of
a regressive tax.

Successful  policies  may  include  an  integrated  combination  of  regulations,  tech-
nology  development,  and  energy  demand  reduction  policies.  Today’s  hearing  will
help to address these approaches.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Let  me  introduce  our  first  and  only  panel
of the day, and it is a very distinguished panel: the Honorable Wil-
liam  Reilly,  Aqua  International  Partners;  Mr.  Paul  Portney,  Presi-

rector  of  Transportation,  Energy  and  Environmental  Analysis,  In-
corporated;  and  Mr.  Michael  Stanton,  Vice  President  of  Govern-
ment Affairs, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

Gentlemen,  the  floor  is  yours,  and  we  will  go  in  the  order  intro-
duced.  We  ask  that  you  try  to  summarize  in  5  minutes  or  so,  but
those  of  you  who  have  been  here  before,  and  Mr.  Reilly,  you  have
been here many times, know that we are all offended by the propo-

1 40 C.F.R. § 600.002–85; 40 C.F.R. § 600.002–93; 49 C.F.R. § 533.4.

sition that you are going to take a very important subject like this
and condense it into 300 seconds. But—so don’t get nervous if that
green  turns  to  caution  and  then  red.  If  you  have  got  a  point  to

With that, I present Mr. Reilly.
STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE WILLIAM K. REILLY, AQUA

INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS
Mr. REILLY. Thank you. Thank you very much.
And  my  congratulations  and  my  compliments  to  you,  sir,  and  to
this committee for scheduling this hearing on a matter that I fully
agree  with  you  is  vital  to  our  national  security,  vital  to  our  econ-
omy, and I think also vital to our environment.

I  want  to  present  my  statement  to  you  in  summary,  and  I  ask
that  my  written  testimony  be  inserted  in  the  record  at  this  time,
if I might.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  without  objection,  so  ordered.  And  I
want  to  advise  all  of  our  panelists  that  your  complete  record  will
be part of the complete testimony and will be available to all of the
Members for their examination.

Mr. REILLY. Thank you.
As  you  mentioned,  I  have,  over  the  past  2c  years,  served  as  co-
chairman  of  the  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy,  which  re-
leased  this  report,  Ending  the  Energy  Stalemate:  A  Bipartisan
Strategy  to  Meet  America’s  Energy  Challenges,  in  early  December.
This report, which was financed in large part by the Hewlett Foun-
dation, involved some $10 million from them and also support from
the  MacArthur  Foundation,  the  Pew  Charitable  Trust,  and  the
Packard  Foundation,  was  conceived  to  try  to  address  some  of  the
most  intractable  problems  confronting  our  energy  situation  in  the
United  States  and  in  the  world  and  to  develop  some  consensus  so-
lutions,  drawing  on  the  experiences  and  insights  of  a  very  diverse
group of members.

I  was  the  Co-chair  of  this  Commission.  My  fellow  co-chairs  were
John Holdren, a Professor at the Kennedy School, and John Rowe,
the Chairman and CEO of Excelon Corporation, one of the Nation’s
largest  electric  power  utilities  based  in  Chicago.  It  included  the
Chief  Economist  of  Ford  Motor  Company,  Group  Vice  President,
Marty  Zimmerman.  It  included  the  Chairman  of  ConocoPhillips
Corporation, the country’s largest refiner of oil and gas. It included
the Chairman of the Board of Consumers Union and a representa-
tive from the United Steelworkers of America Union, and the head
of  the  energy  program  for  the  Natural  Resources  Defense  Council.
It  was,  in  all  respects,  I  think,  as  balanced,  as  diverse,  as  rep-
resentative of the different sectors of the economy, the non-govern-
mental community, the scientific community—we had a Nobel prize
winning scientist as a member, Mario Molina—that you could find.
And  I  think  the  significance  of  much  of  what  I  will  say  is  not  so
much  in  the  novelty  of  what  we  recommend  as  it  is  in  the  back-
grounds  of  the  people  who  supported  it.  And  the  recommendation
that I am going to discuss with you was the product of a consensus
in our Commission.

We  placed,  in  this  Commission,  oil  security  at  the  top  of  our  en-
ergy  priorities.  And  I  would  say  that  one  of  the  most  interesting

charts in our report, and it is included in my submitted testimony,
is  one  that  shows  that  over  the  next  20  years,  the  United  States
and  the  world  at  large  anticipate  a  50  percent-plus  increase  in  oil
demand.  That  is  a  very  large  number.  If  you  look  back  at  the  20
years  from  1980  to  the  year  2000,  it  was  a  time  of  tremendous  in-
novation  in  technology,  new  development  capacity  on  the  part  of
the  oil  industry.  It  was  the  period  when  the  oil  industry  learned
to  reduce,  or  rather  to  increase  the  amount  of  hydrocarbons  it  got
from  a  field,  from  20  percent  to  50  percent.  It  was  a  period  when
deep-water oil exploration and development became possible in the
Gulf and other places to go beyond 5,000 feet deep. It was a period
when  there  was  a  lot  of  new  technology  that  allowed  drilling  from
one well to go out into several fields from that single point.

Nevertheless,  with  all  of  that  innovation,  with  all  of  that  new
technology, with all of that effort, the oil industry worldwide expe-
rienced  a  20  percent  increase  in  production  over  that  20-year  pe-
riod.  As  we  look  ahead  to  the  next  20  years,  seeing  a  50  percent
expected demand increase, it just isn’t there. We are going to have
to find new efficiencies, new opportunities to be more productive in
our use of liquid fuels, alternative fuels, and try to put an economy
together,  for  transportation  particularly,  that  respects  a  new  en-
ergy environment.

There has been, over the last 30 years, significant improvements
in the efficiency of our economy with respect to oil. It takes signifi-
cantly less oil to produce $1,000 of GDP. However, in recent years,
we  have  seen  an  important  slowdown  in  those  improvements.  The
intensity improvements have waned.

We note, and you have noted in your opening remarks, the trans-
portation sector has had the fastest growth in greenhouse gas emis-
sions over the past two decades. Two key solutions we recommend:
increases  in  investment  to  spur  global  oil  production,  and  reduc-
tions in demand domestically.

We reviewed at the Commission several options, a gas tax, CAFE
increases,  alternative  fuels.  In  our  view,  CAFE  increases  provided
the largest demand reduction by far. New technologies like hybrids
and  diesels  will  enter  the  fleet  slowly  and  be  used,  we  believe,  in
large  part  to  increase  power,  weight,  and  other  performance  at-
tributes instead of fuel economy absent increases in CAFE.

In summary, we recommended that Congress should instruct the
National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  to  significantly
strengthen  automobile  fuel  requirements.  New  standards,  we  pro-
pose,  should  be  phased  in  between  2010  and  2015.  We  did  not,
frankly,  reach  agreement,  but  we  discussed  several  possibilities.
We  recommended  a  significant  increase  in  mandatory  automobile
fuel efficiency.

There  is  some  direction  given  in  the  report  on  appropriate  or
plausible CAFE levels to take full advantage of current and emerg-
ing technologies, including hybrids and passenger diesels.

Our  proposal  is  specifically  designed  to  address  political  and
technical  objections  to  traditional  CAFE  increases  which  are:  one,
impacts  on  competitiveness  of  domestic  manufacturers;  two,  im-
pacts  on  domestic  jobs;  and  three,  safety  concerns.  These  are  the
big three that are raised as objections to increases in CAFE.

19

To  deal  with  some  of  these  concerns,  U.S.  manufacturers  and
jobs, we would propose reducing compliance costs by allowing trad-
ing  of  compliance  credits  across  companies.  This  is  not  now  per-
mitted.  According  to  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  this
would net you a 17 percent reduction in the overall cost of compli-
ance with this program.

We  recommended  that  future  costs  of  compliance  with  CAFE  re-
quirements be kept through the use of what we call a ‘‘safety valve’’
to ensure that industry is protected if technology costs exceed gov-
ernment projections.

And finally, we would propose to offer manufacturer incentives to
retool  existing  domestic  auto  plants  to  produce  hybrids  and  ad-
vanced  diesels,  and  we  proposed  that  this  be  at  the  level  of  $1.5
billion over five years.

With  respect  to  safety,  hybrids  can  significantly  boost  mileage
per  gallon  with  the  same  vehicle  size  and  equal  or  better  perform-
ance,  in  our  judgment.  And  we  have  seen  enough  experience  with
hybrids  to  know  that  the  concerns  about  downsizing  and
downweighting  as  the  only  option  available  to  the  auto  manufac-
turers to meet higher standards are misplaced.

Finally,  I  would  just  say  the  stakes  for  our  Nation,  as  you  have
pointed  out,  are  tremendous.  Our  security,  economy,  and  environ-
ment will all benefit considerably if we seize the opportunity to sig-
nificantly increase the fuel economy of our vehicle fleet.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF WILLIAM K. REILLY

Good afternoon Chairman Boehlert. My thanks to you and to the Members of the
Committee for organizing this hearing on a matter of great importance for our coun-
try.

I  am  one  of  three  co-chairs  of  the  National  Commission  on  Energy  Policy.  My
other  Co-chairs  are  John  Rowe,  CEO  of  Excelon,  and  John  Holdren,  a  professor  at
the Kennedy School at Harvard. We are an independent bipartisan group of 16 per-
sons who came together in 2002 with support from the Hewlett Foundation and sev-
eral  other  leading  foundations:  The  MacArthur  Foundation,  Packard  Foundation,
and the Pew Charitable Trusts. The Commission released a report at the end of last
year entitled Ending the Energy Stalemate: A Bipartisan Strategy to Meet America’s
Energy  Challenges.  The  first  chapter  of  this  report  is  about  enhancing  oil  security.
The  placement  of  oil  security  first  among  all  issues  reflects  the  Commission’s  view
that  improving  our  nation’s  oil  security  is  the  most  significant  near  term  energy
challenge  we  face.  I’m  pleased  to  have  an  opportunity  to  summarize  the  Commis-
sion’s recommendations on vehicle fuel economy.

Consistent  with  the  focus  of  this  hearing,  I  will  direct  the  bulk  of  my  remarks
to  the  Commission’s  proposals  to  significantly  increase  vehicle  fuel  economy.  How-
ever, I must note that try as we might, our Commission could not construct a plau-
sible  scenario  in  which  U.S.  and  global  oil  demand  does  not  increase  over  the  next
twenty  years.  For  this  reason,  we  also  propose  a  series  of  measures  designed  to  in-
crease  the  global  production  of  oil  during  this  same  time  period.  I  will  submit  our
entire report and ask that it be made part of the record.
Rationale for Action

From  the  Commission’s  perspective,  there  are  three  considerations  that  reinforce

the need to strengthen passenger vehicle fuel economy:

FIRST,  both  domestic  and  global  demand  for  oil  is  projected  to  grow  by  roughly
50  percent  by  2025.  This  rate  of  growth  is  at  more  than  double  the  historical  rate
since 1980 (Figure 1–1). At the same time, spare capacity to compensate for supply
disruptions  has  fallen  to  a  mere  two  percent  of  global  demand.  Left  unchanged,
these  factors  suggest  that  the  U.S.  economy  will  continue  to  suffer  from  high  and
volatile  oil  prices  and  is  at  risk  of  more  frequent  and  serious  supply  disruptions.

The  energy  sector  has  for  several  years  experienced  a  consistent  and  growing  gap
between oil production and the discovery of replacement reserves.

SECOND,  the  rate  of  improvement  in  U.S.  oil  economic  intensity  has  slowed  in
recent  years.  Oil  economic  intensity  is  a  measure  of  how  much  oil  is  required  for
the U.S. economy to produce a dollar of economic output. This measure is important
because the ability of the U.S. economy to weather oil price shocks improves as oil’s
share  of  our  economic  output  decreases.  Since  1970,  the  U.S.  oil  economic  intensity
has  dropped  by  half—a  tremendous  achievement—largely  due  to  CAFE  standards
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and to a shift in the electricity sector away from
the  use  of  petroleum.  Further  improvements  would  further  insulate  the  U.S.  econ-
omy from oil price shocks (Figure 1–2).

THIRD,  hybrid  and  passenger  diesel  vehicles  hold  the  promise  for  dramatic  im-
provements in vehicle fuel economy. But historical trends suggest that potential fuel
economy gains may be undermined unless government acts to reinforce the need for
improved vehicle fuel economy.

Although U.S. fuel economy has been stagnant sine 1987, the vehicle industry has
made  considerable  strides  in  efficiency.  However,  these  efficiency  improvements
have  been  used  to  increase  vehicle  horsepower  and  weight,  while  still  complying
with  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  standards.  This  trend—favoring
horsepower, weight and other attributes over fuel economy improvements—is likely
to  continue  absent  government  action.  If  we  as  a  nation  are  serious  about  address-
ing  our  dependence  upon  oil,  we  must  seize  the  opportunity  presented  by  hybrids
and passenger diesels (Figure 1–3) to improve the fuel economy of our vehicle fleet.
The Importance of Strengthening Fuel Economy Standards

During  its  deliberations,  the  Commission  considered  a  variety  of  both  major  and
minor  transportation  policy  measures.  These  included  many  of  the  usual  suspects:
a  gasoline  tax,  a  CAFE  increase,  alternative  fuels,  as  well  as  some  new  ideas:
heavy-duty  tractor  trailer  fuel  economy,  efficiency  standards  for  replacement  tires,
congestion charges in urban areas. We examined these policy measures against four
criteria:  (1)  the  ability  to  save  one  million  barrels  per  day  of  oil  by  2025,  (2)  the
cost per barrel of oil saved, (3) administrative complexity, (4) political feasibility. Of
all  the  policies  reviewed  by  the  Commission,  passenger  vehicle  fuel  economy  im-
provements  represented  the  largest  opportunity  for  oil  savings  over  the  next  20
years.

Accordingly,  the  Commission  recommended  that  Congress  instruct  the  National
Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA)  to  significantly  strengthen  CAFE
standards, giving due consideration to vehicle performance, safety, job impacts, and
competitiveness  concerns  consistent  with  statutory  requirements.  We  recommended
that  new  standards  be  phased  in  over  a  five-year  period  beginning  no  later  than
2010.  The  Commission  did  not  reach  agreement  on  a  specific  increase  in  fuel  econ-
omy.

Of  course,  it  would  be  naı¨ve  to  make  recommendations  about  a  CAFE  increase
without  considering  how  to  break  the  current  political  stalemate  on  fuel  economy
standards.  The  Commission  identified  three  issues  that  have  dominated  past  de-
bates  about  raising  CAFE  standards  and  which  we  believe  are  largely  responsible
for the current stalemate: (1) uncertainty over impacts on the competitiveness of do-
mestic  manufacturers;  (2)  fear  that  more  stringent  standards  will  lead  to  smaller,
lighter  vehicles  and  increased  traffic  fatalities;  and  (3)  concerns  that  higher  stand-
ards will lead to losses in domestic jobs.
Competitiveness and U.S. Jobs

To address concerns about competitiveness impacts on U.S. domestic manufactur-
ers and U.S. auto workers, the Commission recommends that a significant increase
in  CAFE  standards  be  accompanied  by  reforms  to  the  current  program  that  would
increase compliance flexibility and reduce compliance costs, together with manufac-
turer  incentives  designed  to  promote  the  domestic  manufacture  of  hybrid-electric
and advanced diesel vehicles.

Specifically,  the  Commission  recommends  that  the  current  program  be  altered  to
allow  manufacturers  to  trade  compliance  credits  with  one  another  and  across  their
car  and  light  truck  fleets.  The  Congressional  Budget  Office  has  estimated  that  this
reform  alone  would  reduce  the  cost  of  the  CAFE  program  by  about  17  percent.  An
additional  reform  that  should  be  considered  in  concert  with  higher  standards  is  a
cost-capping  mechanism  similar  to  the  ‘‘safety  valve’’  the  Commission  is  recom-
mending  in  connection  with  a  tradable  permits  system  for  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions. In this case, the government could make additional CAFE compliance credits
available  to  manufacturers  at  a  pre-determined  price.  Such  a  mechanism  would
have  the  effect  of  protecting  automakers  and  consumers  if  the  regulatory  estimates

21

used  to  set  new  standards  understate  true  costs  and  thus  holds  promise  for  over-
coming  the  inevitable  and  inherently  irresolvable  disagreements  about  future  tech-
nology development that have stymied past CAFE debates.

With  respect  to  manufacturer  incentives,  the  Commission  is  specifically  recom-
mending  a  program  of  tax  incentives  for  U.S.  manufacturing  facilities  that  are  re-
tooled to produce hybrid-electric and advanced diesel vehicle with superior fuel econ-
omy.  Consistent  with  international  trade  agreements,  the  incentive  would  be  avail-
able  to  both  domestic  and  foreign  companies,  including  both  assembly  plants  and
parts  supplies.  The  recommended  subsidy  level  would  total  $1.5  billion  over  ten
years, with the amount of credit set to reflect up to two-thirds of the capital invest-
ment  associated  with  producing  vehicles  or  vehicle  components.  Commission  anal-
ysis indicates that federal outlays under such a program would be more than offset
by  increased  tax  receipts  as  a  result  of  maintaining  domestic  manufacturing  jobs.
Relationship between Safety and Fuel Economy

A  paramount  concern  for  us  when  seeking  to  improve  vehicle  fuel  economy  has
been  to  ensure  that  there  is  no  reduction  in  overall  vehicle  safety.  This  is  the  con-
cern  so  often  expressed:  That  mandating  higher  fuel  economy  will  require  produc-
tion of less safe, lighter vehicles and compromise vehicle performance. Our Commis-
sion  considered  this  concern  and  tested  it  against  currently  marketed  hybrid  vehi-
cles.  Hybrids  and  passenger  diesels  offer  the  potential  to  boost  fuel  economy  while
maintaining  vehicle  size  and  performance.  The  Ford  Escape,  Honda  Civic  hybrid,
the  Honda  Accord  hybrid,  and  the  forthcoming  Toyota  Highlander  hybrid,  all
achieve  substantial  fuel  economy  improvements  while  maintaining  or  increasing
horsepower (by as much as 17 percent) compared to their conventional counterparts,
and  without  reductions  in  weight  or  size.  These  vehicles  clearly  demonstrate  that
substantial  fuel  economy  improvements  can  be  achieved  using  already-available
technologies and without compromising vehicle performance and safety.
Conclusion

Hybrids  and  advanced  diesels  potentially  change  the  game.  They  offer  the
uncompromised features of conventional vehicles while improving dramatically auto-
mobile  fuel  economy.  It  should  be  national  policy  to  foster  early  introduction  on  a
significant scale of these technologies for they promise to make a major contribution
to U.S. energy security.

BIOGRAPHY FOR WILLIAM K. REILLY

William  Kane  Reilly  is  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Aqua  Inter-
national  Partners,  an  investment  group  that  finances  the  purification  of  water  and
waste  water  in  developing  countries,  and  invests  in  projects  and  companies  that
serve  the  water  sector.  Aqua  International  is  sponsored  by  the  U.S.  Overseas  Pri-
vate Investment Corporation and is part of the Texas Pacific Group, an investment
partnership  based  in  Fort  Worth  and  San  Francisco,  which  invests  in  environ-
mental, airline, apparel, health, wine, technology and other companies in the United
States,  Latin  America  and  Asia.  During  the  1993–94  academic  year,  Mr.  Reilly
served  as  the  first  Payne  Visiting  Professor  at  Stanford  University’s  Institute  for
International  Studies  and  delivered  five  public  lectures  on  the  challenges  to  the
global community.

From  1989  to  1993,  he  served  as  the  seventh  Administrator  of  the  U.S.  Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency.  With  18,000  employees  and  a  $7  billion  budget,  EPA  is
an  independent  federal  regulatory  agency  charged  with  improving  and  protecting
public health and the environment.

Prior  to  becoming  EPA  Administrator,  he  held  five  environment-related  positions
over two decades. He was President of World Wildlife Fund (1985–1989) and Presi-
dent  of  The  Conservation  Foundation  (1973–1989).  Those  two  organizations  joined
formally  in  1985  at  which  time  Reilly  became  President  of  both.  He  was  Executive
Director  of  the  Rockefeller  Task  Force  on  Land  Use  and  Urban  Growth  from  1972
to  1973.  From  1970  to  1972,  he  served  as  a  senior  staff  member  of  the  President’s
Council  on  Environmental  Quality  and,  from  1968  to  1970,  as  Associate  Director  of
the Urban Policy Center and the National Urban Coalition. He served as Chairman
of  the  Natural  Resources  Council  of  America,  an  association  of  all  major  conserva-
tion groups, from 1981 to 1983.

Reilly  has  written  and  lectured  extensively  on  environmental  issues.  He  has
served  on  the  boards  of  numerous  public  and  private  sector  organizations  and  re-
ceived  a  number  of  awards  and  medals  for  his  contributions  to  environmental
progress.  He  currently  serves  on  the  boards  of  Dupont,  Eden  Springs,  Ltd.,
ConocoPhillips,  Ionics,  and  Royal  Caribbean  International,  and  is  a  member  of  the
Advisory Board of ERM CVS. His service to non-profit organizations includes chair-
manship  of  the  Board  of  World  Wildlife  Fund  and  of  the  Board  of  Advisors  of  the
Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and mem-
bership on the Boards of Trustees of the American Academy in Rome, National Geo-

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Reilly.
Dr. Portney.

STATEMENT OF MR. PAUL R. PORTNEY, PRESIDENT,

RESOURCES FOR THE FUTURE

Mr.  PORTNEY.  Chairman  Boehlert,  Members  of  the  Committee,
thank  you  very  much  for  having  me  here  today,  and  thank  you,
also,  Mr.  Chairman,  for  your  kind  words  about  the  2001  National
Research  Council  report  on  fuel  economy  standards.  I  appreciate
that.  As  you  mentioned,  it  was  somewhat  overtaken  by  the  debate
in the Energy Bill, but a month and a week later, overtaken by the
events of September 11, 2001, to which I will come back in my tes-
timony here.

I will summarize, as you have indicated, my remarks here today.
Thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  put  my  complete  remarks  into  the
record.

I  am  testifying  before  you  today  principally  in  my  capacity  as
having  been  chairman  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  2001
report  on  the  effectiveness  and  impact  of  Corporate  Average  Fuel
Economy  standards.  Let  me  also  say  that  nothing  I  should  say
today  should  be  construed  or  attributed  to  Resources  for  the  Fu-
ture. I am appearing in my—as an individual and in my role as the
chairman of the National Academy of Sciences committee.

I  thought  what  I  would  do  for  you  is  very  briefly  summarize  for
you  the  findings  of  that  National  Academy  report.  Some  time  has
passed since that report. Because it has been 3c years, I would also
like  to  reflect  back  on  what  has  changed  during  the  past  3c  years.
Those  views  will  be  my  own.  I  can  purport  to  speak  for  the  whole
committee, because we haven’t met during that period of time, but
I  thought  it  might  be  useful  for  me  to  reflect  on  the  recommenda-
tions of the committee in light of the events over the last 3c  years.
So  let  me  start  by  giving  you  sort  of  very  quickly  the  basic  con-
clusions that that National Academy of Sciences committee reached
in 2001.

First  of  all,  we  found  that  CAFE  has  played  an  important  role
in boosting the fuel economy of the new vehicle fleet in the United
States.  That  occurred  principally  between  the  period  1978  or  so
until  the  early  1980s.  And  the  committee  was  very  careful  to  say
that  while  CAFE,  in  the  view  of  the  committee  members,  indis-
putably  played  a  role  in  the  improvements  in  fuel  economy  that
happened  during  that  period  of  time.  Of  course,  also  during  that
period  of  time,  gasoline  prices  had  increased  dramatically  so  that
there  became,  on  the  part  of  the  public,  a  demand  for  more  fuel-
efficient vehicles to which car makers responded.

And  because  these  two  events  happened  more  or  less  contem-
poraneously,  both  pushing  in  the  direction  of  improved  fuel  econ-
omy,  we  couldn’t  separate  out  how  much  of  the  improvement  in
fuel  economy  was  due  to  higher  prices  and  how  much  was  due  to
the CAFE standards. We will note, however, that after about 1982,
when gasoline prices collapsed, fuel economy did not go back to its
old  level,  suggesting  that  the  improvements  that  we  got  were  per-
manent  improvements  that  we  might  not  have  gotten  had  we  not
instituted a CAFE program during that period of time.

The  committee  also  found  that  CAFE  had  some  adverse  effects.
You were—we were requiring car makers to devote resources to im-
proving  fuel  economy.  These  are  resources  that  they  could  not  de-
vote  to  improving  the  performance  characteristics  of  vehicles  or  to
doing other things with those resources during that period of time.
And,  and  I  can’t  emphasize  how  important  this  point  is,  because
car  makers  were  required  to  boost  fuel  economy  by  almost  50  per-
cent in a relatively short period of time, they didn’t have the option
of  rolling  in  a  lot  of  new  fuel-saving  technologies.  Rather,  the  way
they chose to meet much tougher fuel economy standards in a short
period  of  time  was  by  making  cars  smaller  and  lighter.  And  the
CAFE  committee,  with  two  exceptions,  was  of  the  mind  that  this
accelerated  very  quick  reduction—or  improvement  in  fuel  economy
through downsizing had adverse effects on the safety of the vehicle
fleet. We predicted, or estimated, that an additional 1,300 to 2,600
fatalities  by  2003  would  have—or  took  place  that  wouldn’t  have
taken  place  if  car  makers  had  not  had  to  quickly  downsize  and
downweight vehicles to meet the fuel economy standards.

Again,  this  was  not  a  unanimous  view  of  the  committee.  David
Greene,  one  of  the  two  committee  members  who  dissented  from
that  particular  conclusion  of  the  panel,  is  here  today,  and  he  will
have an opportunity to speak for himself later.

Third,  we  found  that  technologies  clearly  exist  or,  at  that  time,
were in the process of being developed that would make it possible
to improve the fuel economy of the new vehicle fleet at a cost, cer-
tainly,  but  nevertheless  a  cost  that  would  be  more  than  offset  by
the  fuel  economy  savings  that  would  result  from  these  more  fuel-
efficient  vehicles  over  the  next  14  years.  The  estimated  improve-
ments that would be possible by putting into widespread use in the
new  vehicle  fleet  ranged  from  12  to  25  percent  for  passenger  cars
and  from  25  to  42  percent  for  light-duty  trucks.  That  comprises
minivans,  pick-up  trucks,  and  sport  utility  vehicles.  And,  impor-
tantly,  if  car  makers  were  given  enough  time  to  meet  these  new
fuel  economy  goals,  and  by  enough  time,  we  were  looking  in  the
range  of  10  to  12  to  15  years,  then  these  improvements  would  be
capable 
or  without
downweighting, and therefore, without adverse effects on the safety
of the fleet.

of  being  made  without  downsizing 

I  can’t  emphasize  how  important  it  is,  in  the  view  of  the  com-
mittee,  that  in  contemplating  tightening  fuel  economy  standards
that you do so over a long enough period of time that the car mak-
ers  have  an  opportunity  to  take  advantage  of  these  technologies
that  are  out  there  and  are  currently  being  developed  so  that  they
don’t  have  to  engage  in  a,  and  I  don’t  intend  to  bad  pun  here,  a
crash  program  to  improve  fuel  economy  that  might  compromise
safety.

Reinforcing one point that Bill Reilly has already made, the com-
mittee  felt  very,  very  strongly  that  the  credits  that  can  currently
be earned in a very limited way in the CAFE program ought to be
made  fully  tradable  so  that  someone  who  beats  their  fuel  economy
standards can not only use those credits themselves in a later year,
they  can  trade  across  passenger  car  and  light-duty  truck  fleets,  or
they could sell these credits to other car companies that are falling
short of hitting their targets.

Let  me  give  you  my  brief  update  of  things  that  have  happened
in the 3c years since the committee report that I think are material
to your deliberations.

First  of  all,  September  11  happened  one  month  and  one  week
after  the  committee  issued  its  final  report.  Since  that  time,  quite
unsurprisingly,  oil  security  is—looms  much  more  importantly  in
the  national  debate.  And  if  the  committee  were  doing  its  work
today,  it  is  conceivable  that  we  might  give  an  even  greater  value
to  reduced  oil  consumption  on  account  of  the  potential  for  macro-
economic disruptions associated with fluctuations in oil import and
oil domestic produced—domestically produced oil prices.

Second,  during  the  period  of  time  since  the  issuance  of  the  re-
port, gasoline prices have gone up between 20 and 25 percent. This
pushes the car companies in the direction of making more fuel-effi-
cient  vehicles,  because  passengers  have  an  incentive  to  demand
more fuel-efficient cars the more expensive the price of gasoline is.
I  actually  think  we  are  seeing  some  evidence  of  this.  But  for  this
price  effect  to  continue,  consumers  have  to  believe  that  prices  will
remain  high,  not  slip  down  to  the  $1.60  a  gallon  that  they  were
when the National Academy committee was doing its work.

Third,  in  the  3c  years  since  we  have  issued  our  report,  hybrids
have penetrated much more significantly into the new vehicle mar-
ket  than  we  anticipated  at  the  time.  I  think  we  were  probably  too
conservative  in  our  report  about  the  potential  for  hybrids.  Recent
estimates  suggest  that  by  2008/2009  there  could  be  as  many  as
800,000  hybrids  sold  in  the  United  States.  Last  year,  I  think  the
total  was  between  45,000  and  50,000.  And  if  that  number  of  hy-
brids sold grows dramatically, the cost per hybrid sold comes down,
and  that  could  make  a  big  difference  in  the  costs  associated  with
meeting tighter fuel economy standards.

I would also like to emphasize that in the 3c years since we com-
pleted  our  report,  much  progress  has  been  made  on  a  new  genera-
tion  of  clean  diesel  engines.  And  I  think  this  is  very  important  for
the  fuel  economy  debate,  because  diesel  engines,  all  of  the  things
being constant, hold out the possibility of improvements of 25 to 40
percent  in  fuel  economy.  If  we  were  writing  that  report  today,  I
think we would pay more attention to the potential for these clean
diesels to help in the fuel economy challenge.

And  finally,  research  has  been  done  since  that  time  on  the  so-
called  rebound  effect.  I  won’t  go  into  great  detail  on  this,  but  this
suggests that as people own cars that get better fuel economy, they
may drive those cars more. And some of the adverse effects associ-
ated  with  more  vehicle  miles  traveled,  depending  on  the  way  you
value  those,  actually  have  the  potential  to  cancel  out  some  or  all
of the beneficial effects of improved fuel economy.

So  that  is  my  quick  summary  of  what  has  happened  in  the  time
we  have  done  the  report.  Thank  you,  again,  for  having  me  here.
And I would be happy to take any questions later.

Thanks.

(CAFE)  Standards  of  the  National  Research  Council  (NRC).  The  Research  Council
is  the  operating  arm  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  the  National  Academy
of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine, charted by Congress in 1863 to advise
the  government  on  matters  of  science  and  technology.  My  comments  today  reflect
my  own  views  and,  to  the  best  of  my  abilities,  those  of  the  NRC  committee  mem-
bers. They do not reflect the views of Resources for the Future, an independent and
non-partisan  research  organization  that  takes  no  institutional  positions  on  legisla-
tive matters.

It is a pleasure to be here to discuss with you the NRC’s 2001 report. This study
was requested by Congress to provide assistance in its decisions related to fuel econ-
omy  standards.  I  would  like  to  provide  a  brief  overview  of  the  report,  while  noting
that it was detailed and cannot be done justice to in a few minutes. Therefore I re-
quest  that  we  include  the  Executive  Summary  of  that  report  as  part  of  the  record.
(See  Appendix  2:  Additional  Material  for  the  Record.)  Following  my  overview  of  the
2001 report, I will make a few remarks about developments in the three-and-a-half
years  since  the  committee  did  its  work.  Let  me  say  here,  as  I  will  again  later,  that
I will not be speaking for the committee in offering this update.

The NRC committee had a three-part mission in 2001 when it did its work:

1. Determine  the  effect  that  CAFE  standards  have  had  on  fuel  economy,  and

their impact on the industry, consumers, safety, and other issues;

2. Estimate  the  impact  that  changes  to  CAFE  standards  might  have  in  the  fu-

ture; and

3. Evaluate  the  structure  of  the  CAFE  program  and  recommend  potential  im-

provements.

Review of the Then-Current CAFE Program

Our review of the impacts of CAFE standards through mid-2001 convinced us that
the  program  had  significantly  reduced  fuel  consumption.  Other  factors  also  have
been  important,  especially  the  reaction  of  consumers  and  the  automotive  industry
to  higher  fuel  prices  in  the  1970s  and  early  1980s.  The  committee  could  not  appor-
tion responsibility among these factors, but noted that CAFE was clearly important.
In the years since the early- to mid-1980s, CAFE indisputably played an important
role  in  maintaining  higher  fuel  economy  than  otherwise  would  have  resulted,  espe-
cially  during  periods  when  gasoline  prices  were  much  lower  than  those  prevailing
today.

There  have  been  adverse  consequences  associated  with  the  CAFE  program  as
well.  Safety  is  most  important.  The  majority  of  the  committee  concluded  in  2001
that  the  downsizing  and  downweighting  that  occurred  in  the  late  1970s  and  1980s
(partially  in  response  to  CAFE)  resulted  in  an  additional  1,300  to  2,600  fatalities
in 1993. While fatalities were declining in this period, most committee members be-
lieve  that  they  would  have  declined  this  much  more  had  the  downweighting  and
downsizing  not  occurred.  Two  members  of  the  committee  dissented  from  this  view.
They believed that the data did not support this conclusion, and that the net effect
on highway fatalities of the increases in fuel economy may have been zero.

An  additional  impact,  although  one  we  were  unable  to  quantify,  had  to  do  with
restrictions  on  consumer  choice.  Requiring  automotive  manufacturers  to  focus  on
fuel  economy  diverted  their  resources  from  improving  other  attributes  valued  by
consumers, such as acceleration and carrying capacity.
Impact of Higher Standards

First let me note that the committee did not recommend whether or by how much
the  government  should  tighten  the  current  fuel  economy  standards.  We  believed
that  is  a  decision  belonging  to  Congress,  the  President,  and  appointed  officials  be-
cause  it  involves  tradeoffs  among  factors  very  important  to  the  people  of  this  coun-
try—the costs of driving, the environment, national security, consumer choice, safe-
ty,  and  others.  In  so  far  as  possible,  the  committee  identified  these  tradeoffs,  but
a full analysis was not possible within the short time allotted to this study.

The committee believed that it is incumbent on decision-makers to understand the
benefits of fuel economy improvements and to ensure that the costs associated with
these  improvements  don’t  outweigh  the  benefits.  The  two  main  benefits  the  com-
mittee  considered  were  the  macro-economic  gains  associated  with  reduced  exposure
to fluctuating world oil markets and reduced emissions of the greenhouse gases that
may  be  linked  to  global  climate  change.  Analysts  have  assigned  a  wide  variety  of
values to reducing these externalities. The committee considered this range and ulti-
mately  chose  values  which,  in  total,  are  equivalent  to  about  30  cents/gallon  of  fuel.
That is, each gallon of gasoline consumed has adverse economic and environmental
consequences that, when combined, amount to as much as $0.30. I mention this fig-

ure  not  because  the  committee  endorsed  it  (indeed  other  analysts  might  chose  val-
ues  much  higher  or  lower),  but  because  it  helps  to  understand  how  hard  one  can
push on fuel economy.

With  that  as  context,  the  committee  concluded  that  significant  improvements  in
fuel  economy  are  quite  possible  at  reasonable  cost.  A  variety  of  technologies  to  im-
prove  fuel  economy  are  available  for  cars  and  light  trucks.  Many  have  been  devel-
oped  and  are  being  implemented  in  Europe  and  Japan  where  fuel  prices  are  much
higher  than  here.  Specifically,  Variable  Valve  Lift  and  Timing  can  reduce  fuel  con-
sumption  by  3–8  percent.  Continuously  variable  transmissions  can  achieve  another
4–8  percent.  Other  technologies  are  under  development  and  will  be  available  for
wide  scale  use  within  15  years.  Fuel  economy  can  be  raised  more  for  heavier  vehi-
cles  than  for  light  ones,  and  the  resulting  fuel  savings  will  be  much  higher  for  the
heavier vehicles as well. For example, the fuel economy of a mid-size SUV could be
improved  by  34  percent  (from  21  to  28  miles  per  gallon).  Over  the  lifetime  of  the
vehicle,  these  improvements  would  save  nearly  2,000  gallons,  which  would  more
than pay for their incremental cost.

As  with  the  current  CAFE  program,  raising  standards  will  have  other  con-
sequences as well, with safety again being the most contentious. Any increase in fa-
talities  will  depend  on  how  manufacturers  meet  higher  standards.  While  the  tech-
nologies examined by the committee generally appear to be more cost-effective than
weight  reduction,  CAFE  standards,  as  currently  structured,  do  not  preclude  any
methods. Thus some manufacturers might include some weight reduction, which the
majority  of  the  committee  believed  could  involve  some  safety  consequences.  How-
ever,  it  is  also  possible  that  weight  reductions  could  be  concentrated  in  the  heavier
vehicles. This would reduce the weight disparity in the fleet, which could have bene-
ficial consequences for safety. This could occur because the greater risk for the occu-
pants  of  the  downsized  vehicles  would  be  more  than  balanced  by  the  lessened  risk
for other road users.

A  key  point  to  make  here  is  that  the  committee  felt  strongly  that  automakers
must  be  given  sufficient  time  to  accommodate  more  stringent  fuel  economy  stand-
ards. The less time they are given to meet new requirements, especially significantly
more  stringent  ones,  the  more  likely  it  is  that  they  will  respond  not  through  the
introduction  of  fuel-saving  technologies  but  rather  through  down-weighting  and/or
down-sizing. This could have adverse consequences for safety.
Recommendations on the Structure of the CAFE Program

First,  it  was  the  committee’s  view  that  there  is  a  marked  inconsistency  between
raising  fuel  economy  standards  while  keeping  fuel  taxes  low.  The  committee  cer-
tainly did not recommend raising taxes to the level of European countries (or to any
specific  level  for  that  matter),  but  the  members  believed  strongly  that  efforts  to
raise fuel economy would work much better if consumers had more motivation from
higher  fuel  prices.  Since  the  2001  report  was  written,  gasoline  prices  in  the  United
States have risen roughly 20 percent. If consumers perceive this increase to be per-
manent,  it  will  begin  to  affect  their  new-vehicle  purchases.  In  fact,  there  is  some
anecdotal evidence to suggest that it already has.

The committee recommended that a tradable credit program be part of any regu-
latory  program  on  fuel  economy.  Even  if  the  current  structure  of  CAFE  is  main-
tained  and  the  standards  not  raised,  the  program  can  be  made  more  efficient  and
effective  with  tradable  credits.  All  manufacturers  would  have  incentive  to  raise  the
economy  of  all  their  vehicles,  and  the  results  are  likely  to  be  less  costly  than  the
current  approach  of  treating  each  manufacturer  and  each  vehicle  segment  sepa-
rately.  Tradable  credits  have  worked  well  in  reducing  the  costs  of  sulfur  dioxide
emissions  from  coal-fired  power  plants,  and  the  committee  believes  they  will  work
as well on fuel economy.

Finally, the committee recommended that consideration be given to modifying the
current structure of the CAFE program in such a way that the applicable fuel econ-
omy  standards  for  varying  types  of  vehicles  depend  at  least  in  part  on  their  at-
tributes—that  is,  their  weight,  interior  size,  or  some  combination  of  characteristics.
I  would  note  that  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  is  giving
thought  to  this  approach  now.  The  committee  also  recommended  the  elimination  of
both  the  two-fleet  rule  that  distinguishes  between  the  domestic  and  foreign  ‘‘con-
tent’’  of  vehicles  and  the  granting  of  extra  fuel  economy  credits  for  the  production
of dual-fuel vehicles.
Update

Three  and  a  half  years  have  passed  since  the  NRC  committee  on  CAFE  did  its
work.  I  thought  it  might  be  useful  for  me  to  reflect  on  developments  since  August

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

32

of  2001  and  what  they  might  mean  for  the  fuel  economy  debate.  It  should  be  clear
that I am speaking for myself here and not for the members of the NRC committee.
The  CAFE  committee  issued  its  report  about  a  month  before  the  horrific  events
of  September  11,  2001.  Those  events  and  their  ongoing  aftermath  have  made  us
think much more seriously than before about the consequences of U.S. oil consump-
tion and our growing dependence for imported oil on nations that are unstable and/
or may bear us ill will. Were the 2001 NRC committee meeting today, its members
might  assign  an  even  larger  value  to  reducing  oil  consumption  so  as  to  reduce  our
economic vulnerability to oil price shocks, either accidental or deliberate.

Next,  oil  prices  have  risen  considerably  since  the  time  of  the  2001  report,  prin-
cipally a reflection of rapidly growing demand for oil in the developing world (espe-
cially  China  and  India),  coupled  with  slower  growth  in  production.  If  sustained,
these higher prices will act as a stimulus to the production of more fuel-efficient ve-
hicles, for the simple reason that people will demand better fuel economy. However,
the externalities associated with oil consumption and its effect on both the economy
and the environment would still justify government intervention to further improve
fuel economy.

Third,  in  its  deliberations  on  new  technologies  that  might  be  used  to  improve  fu-
ture fuel economy, the 2001 NRC committee gave little consideration to either gaso-
line-electric  hybrids  or  diesel-powered  passenger  cars  and  light-duty  trucks.  The
former,  the  committee  felt,  were  too  expensive  to  make  a  significant  difference  in
fleet-wide fuel economy over the next ten to fifteen years, while the latter faced stiff
challenges  related  to  vehicle  emissions  standards  for  both  oxides  of  nitrogen  and
also fine particulate matter.

We  may  have  been  too  conservative  in  both  these  assessments.  Hybrid  vehicle
sales  have  grown  faster  than  anyone  expected—to  86,000  in  the  U.S.  in  2004.  Ac-
cording  to  industry  experts,  hybrid  sales  could  amount  to  400,000-500,000  by  the
2008–09  model  year,  with  significant  penetration  in  both  the  passenger  car  and
light-duty  truck  segments  of  the  market.  Similarly,  considerable  progress  is  being
made  in  the  development  of  much  cleaner  diesel  engines;  this  is  important  because
diesel-powered  vehicles  get  30  percent  better  fuel  economy  than  conventional  inter-
nal  combustion  gasoline  engines.  If  the  cost  penalty  associated  with  hybrids  falls
significantly because of larger-than-expected volumes, and if car makers find a way
to  produce  diesel  engines  that  are  capable  of  meeting  tougher  emissions  standards
in  California  and  the  rest  of  the  U.S.  for  the  lifetime  of  vehicles,  things  could  be
different.  That  is,  it  might  be  possible  to  meet  more  stringent  fuel  economy  stand-
ards  at  lower  costs  for  less  than  the  committee  foresaw  in  2001.  Once  again,  this
is speculation on my part alone; this view should not be attributed to the 2001 com-
mittee.

Finally, looking back on our 2001 report, I wish we had had the time to pay closer
attention to the so-called ‘‘rebound effect’’ (this refers to the additional miles motor-
ists  may  drive  in  vehicles  that  get  better  fuel  economy).  Some  recent  research  by
my  colleagues  at  Resources  for  the  Future  suggests  that  the  negative  consequences
resulting  from  the  added  congestion,  air  pollution  and  accident  risks  could  cancel
out the beneficial economic and environmental effects of improved fuel economy, de-
pending  on  how  all  these  effects  are  valued.  I  take  responsibility  for  having  given
this  important  issue  less  attention  than  I  believe  it  deserves,  and  I  urge  the  com-
mittee to consider it in future deliberations over the CAFE program.

Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  House  Science  Committee.  That
concludes  my  prepared  remarks.  I  would  be  happy  to  answer  any  questions  you
have.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much, Mr. Portney. And I
want  to  thank  both  you  and  Administrator  Reilly  for  focusing  on
the  fact  that  this  is,  first  and  foremost,  a  national  security  issue.
Then it is a consumer economy issue. It also happens to be an issue
of importance to those of us concerned about the environment. And
I  would  submit  that  most  of  us  are  concerned  about  the  environ-
ment. I don’t want it to be portrayed as the greens against the rest
of the world. It is not the case at all.

So—and  the  other  thing  I  am  glad  you  made  reference,  as  I  did
in my opening statement, to the debate in ’01 just prior to 9/11, be-
cause  it  was  just  within  hours  of  the  issuance  of  your  report  that
Congress began the debate. And I would suggest in many respects,
it  was  not  an  informed  debate,  because  the  Congress  did  not  have
the benefit of a thorough examination of your outstanding work.

So thank you for what you have done.
Am  I  indicating  to  some  of  my  fellow  colleagues  my  preference

in this issue?
Mr. Duleep.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  K.G.  DULEEP,  MANAGING  DIRECTOR  OF
TRANSPORTATION,  ENERGY  AND  ENVIRONMENTAL  ANAL-
YSIS, INC.
Mr. DULEEP. Mr. Chairman, thank you for having me here.
The  Committee’s  staff  has  asked  me  to  focus  on  technology
issues, and that will be the focus. They asked me four specific ques-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

34

tions. I will try and summarize my comments and have the written
testimony submitted to the record.

The  first  question  I  will  focus  on  is  what  technologies  are  avail-
able  to  improve  fuel  economy.  I  have  a  chart  in  there  on  what  I
call conventional technologies that you can go out and actually buy
on some car made today. So you can actually just walk into a deal-
ership and buy one of these. They haven’t yet penetrated the fleet.
They  are  in  just  a  few  cars  now,  and  we  estimate  that  if  you  take
all  of  those  technologies,  and  I  have  a  table  in  my  written  testi-
mony,  and  you  put  them  onto  one  car  or  one  truck,  you  can  get
something  like  24  or  25  percent  improvement  from  these  tech-
nologies in the fuel economy. They would add about $800 to $1,000
on the price of a vehicle, the retail price.

If  you  look  at  how  much  fuel  they  save  and  what  the  value  of
it,  they  pretty  much  pay  for  themselves  over  50,000  miles  of  use,
so  a  consumer  buying  these  technologies  would  get  paid  back  in
three or four years. That is a typical measure used by auto compa-
nies  to  judge  whether,  in  fact,  they  are  to  introduce  these  tech-
nologies.

One  of  the  important  points  on  this  is  that  I  believe  that  most
of  these  technologies  will  be  adopted,  or  could  be  adopted,  in  most
cars  by  the  manufacturers  just  on  the  free  market,  just  on  a  com-
petitive  basis,  largely  because  they  make  sense.  If  they  pay  for
themselves,  why  not?  We  have  looked  at  many  of  the  public  an-
nouncements made by General Motors and Ford and so on, and we
can see all of these technologies coming in the next few years.

At the same time, I don’t want to imply that this means that fuel
economy  will  improve  by  25  percent  in  the  next  10  years,  largely
because  the  consumers  are  buying  more  performance,  larger  vehi-
cles, and so on. So I expect about half of the improvements will ac-
tually be lost to consumers buying more vehicles, four-wheel-drive,
and  so  on.  And  that  is  assuming  that  gas  prices  stay  about  where
they are today, about $2 a gallon.

Next,  I  will  briefly  discuss  the  issue  that  Dr.  Portney  raised,
which  is  the  issue  of  diesel  engines  and  hybrids.  At  the  time  the
National  Academy  met,  there  was  a  lot  of  debate  about  whether
the diesel could meet U.S. emissions standards. There is still some
debate  today,  but  having  spoken  to  a  lot  of  the  leading  diesel  en-
gine  manufacturers  in  the  world,  I  am  fairly  confident  that  they
will meet these standards in the next three or four years.

The  diesel  engine  can  improve—just  by  itself,  can  improve  vehi-
cle  fuel  economy  by  something  like  35  to  40  percent,  and  they  are
widely  used  in  Europe.  If  you  add  some  of  the  other  conventional
technology  improvements,  the  vehicle  fuel  economy  can  go  up  by
more  than  50  percent.  So  it  is  a  huge  fuel  economy  improvement
possibility,  but  the  cost  of  the  diesel  engine  is  pretty  high.  A  four-
cylinder  diesel  engine  with  all  of  the  advanced  emission  controls
will  add  something  like  $2,200  to  the  price  of  a  car.  If  you  use  a
V6 or a larger engine, it will add something like $3,500 to the price
of a truck.

At those prices, you don’t get the payback. It won’t pay for itself,
but  I  think  consumers  will  still  value  things  like  it  has  a  lot  of
torque  so  it  can  tow  trailers  and  so  on,  and  it  has  at  least  the
image of great durability so it can run maybe a half a million miles

without  a  major  overhaul.  Consumers  value  that,  and  they  appear
to  certainly  prefer  diesel  engines  in  the  larger  pick-up  trucks  even
today.

Going back to the hybrid, that has become very popular now, but
there are lots of different kinds of hybrids. At the one end, we have
the Toyota Prius, and I think Ford uses a very similar design, and
some  people  call  that  a  full  hybrid.  Somewhere  in  between,  we
have the Honda Accord and Honda Civic, which uses a much small-
er  motor  and  the  battery  than  the  Toyota  Prius.  Then  we  have
other  designs  by  General  Motors  and  DaimlerChrysler.  And  all  of
these  are  different  implications  for  fuel  economy.  So  when  people
use  the  word  ‘‘hybrid,’’  they  don’t  use  it  in  a  very  consistent  way,
and there are lots of flavors of them.

But  there  is  one  common  characteristic  that  hybrids  have.  Most
of their fuel economy improvement occurs in city driving. So it has
to  be  stop-and-go  driving.  On  the  highway,  hybrids  don’t  give  you
much,  whereas  with  the  diesel  engine,  the  fuel  economy  gains  are
more robust across all of the driving conditions.

One  of  the  things  I  do  want  to  point  out  is  that  there  has  been
a  lot  of  attention  paid  to  the  Toyota  Prius,  and  rightly  so.  It  is  a
wonderful  car.  But  if  you  look  at  how  much  it  costs  to  make,  and
you assume that manufacturers take their standard profit margins
and  pay  back  their  cost  of  capital  and  so  on,  we  estimate  that,  at
today’s  prices,  if  you  built  a  Toyota  hybrid-like  mid-sized  car,  the
retail  price  should  go  up  about  $6,000.  It  gives  you  about  a  50  to
55  percent  fuel  economy  improvement.  And  clearly,  that—you  are
not going to make that money back in fuel savings.

But the other thing that the press does not seem to notice is that
there  are  other  very  smart  ways  to  do  it.  Honda,  for  example,  as
I  mentioned,  uses  a  motor  that  is  maybe  half  the  size  of  the  one
in the Prius, a battery that is less than half the size, and they get
fuel  economy  numbers  that  are  almost  as  good  as  the  Prius.  So
there are very advanced ways to exploit synergies between the en-
gine,  the  electric  motor,  and  the  transmission  that  may  cut  the
costs tremendously. So we see something like the cost coming down
below  $2,000,  at  which  point  it  starts  to  make  sense  to  the  con-
sumer.

I would also mention that we know some companies are working
on  diesel  hybrid  combinations  in  Europe,  and  we  expect  to  see
them in something like 2008.

One  of  the  continuing  issues  has  been  this  issue  of  safety  and
fuel  economy.  Others  on  this  panel  will  comment  on  it.  But  a  lot
of those issues that the panel—that people on this panel talk about
is  what  happens  after  the  crash  has  occurred.  I  think  this  com-
mittee  should  be  made  aware  that  there  are  really  amazing
changes in new technology in preventing crashes from occurring in
the first place. These are technologies like blind spot warning, pre-
crash  sensing,  lane  departure  warning,  night  vision,  and  so  on.  In
fact,  I  think  in—perhaps  five  or  10  years  down  the  road,  a  vehicle
will  be  able  to  brake  itself  before  it  hits  anything  else,  and  so  the
whole issue of safety and fuel economy links becomes almost moot.
Lastly,  I  was  asked  to  address  issues  regarding  government  pol-
icy  in  fuel  economy.  Like  Dr.  Portney,  I  agree  that  the  CAFE
standards did achieve some goals. But I think that it did disadvan-

tage  the  domestic  manufacturers,  because  all  manufacturers,  re-
gardless of what you produce, have to meet the same MPG number,
even  if  you  build  large  cars  or  small  cars,  whatever  your  mix  is.
Dr.  Greene  and  I  have  done  some  studies  looking  at  some  other
forms of standards, and I expect Dr. Greene will address this more
fully,  but  the  basic  fact  is  there  are  different  ways  of  doing  this
that are, perhaps, more equitable in this treatment of manufactur-
ers.

Second, I want to just briefly touch on the issue of consumer re-
sponse. Here I would take some issue at the Honorable Reilly’s rec-
ommendations  from  the  National  Commission  on  Energy,  which
were  all  focused  on  manufacturers.  Here  we  have  a  situation,  as
you  know,  even  with  record  prices  last  year,  light  truck  market
share  reached  a  new  record  in  2004:  55  percent  of  all  vehicles
bought in the U.S. were light trucks. Today, we see cars with 400,
500,  and  even  600  horsepower  that  are  meant  for  street  use.  So
clearly  consumers  are  going  in  the  direction  that  needs  some  re-
straint,  and  I  would  suggest  that  an  important  part  of  energy  pol-
icy has to be—has to include the consumer or has to be some form
of consumer education.

Another point that I would like to touch on is this issue that Dr.
Portney,  again,  briefly  touched  on,  which  is  many  economists  con-
tinue  to  believe  that  if  you  raise  fuel  prices,  that  is  going  to  solve
the  problem.  We  have  to  remember  that  five  years  ago,  gas  was
$1.20  a  gallon.  Last  year,  it  was  almost  $2.00  a  gallon,  and  that
is a 50 percent price increase. Yet if I look at the numbers in terms
of fuel economy, what people are buying, the vehicle miles of travel,
it  is  hard  to  see  that  there  has  been  a  big  effect.  I  personally  feel
that  the  estimates  that  were  put  forward  by  the  National  Acad-
emies were, perhaps, an order of magnitude too large in this issue.
Lastly,  I  would  touch  on  subsidies  and  fees  for  technology.  Here
I  think  the  experience  has  shown  that  it  is  probably  not  a  good
idea to subsidize specific technologies. I would mention in this—ex-
ample the issue between, say, the Toyota Prius and the Honda de-
sign,  if  you  can  figure  out  a  smarter,  cheaper  way  of  doing  some-
thing,  it  may  not  be  covered  by  the  specific  definition  used  to  sub-
sidize  a  technology.  I  would  certainly  advocate  that  tax  rebates  or
subsidies  for  fuel-efficient  vehicles  be  independent  of  the  kind  of
technology used to get there, whether it be diesel or some very ad-
vanced type of gasoline engine or some hybrid, because ultimately,
we want to reduce fuel use, and that should be the goal of the sub-
sidy.  These  subsidies  could  be  phased  out  over  some  period.  The
principle idea behind the subsidy would be to reduce manufacturer
risk  of  investing  in  something  that  we  have  no  idea  whether  the
consumers are going to buy.

Thank  you  for  your  attention.  I  will  be  pleased  to  answer  your

questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF K.G. DULEEP

Mr. Chairman and Members of the House Science Committee,

Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  participate  in  this  hearing  on  the  topic  of  vehicle
fuel  efficiency.  I  am  the  Managing  Director  at  Energy  &  Environmental  Analysis
(EEA), a consulting firm. EEA has been involved in analyzing this topic for the last

25  years  and  has  provided  the  Department  of  Energy  with  many  analyses  of  tech-
nologies  over  this  period.  EEA  has  also  worked  for  a  number  of  foreign  govern-
ments,  notably  Canada  and  Australia,  on  this  issue.  The  views  expressed  by  me  at
this  hearing,  however,  are  my  own  and  do  not  reflect  the  views  of  the  DOE  or  any
of  my  other  clients.  I  was  instructed  by  the  Committee’s  staff  to  respond  to  four
questions,  and  I  will  focus  on  these  questions  in  my  testimony.  I  have  highlighted
the key points in my written testimony
CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS

The first question posed was on the identification of technologies available to im-
prove light-duty vehicle fuel economy and their potential benefit. This is a question
that  has  received  much  attention  and  most  analyses  separate  ‘‘conventional’’  tech-
nologies  that  are  evolutionary  improvements  to  existing  technology  from  ‘‘revolu-
tionary’’ technologies that involve new types of engines and/or fuels. In this context,
hybrid and diesel vehicles could be described as revolutionary and their benefits are
described  in  the  response  to  the  second  question.  All  of  the  fuel  economy  benefits
cited are on the EPA combined city-highway test unless an alternative is specifically
mentioned.

The  available  conventional  technologies  have  been  extensively  researched  and  I
can  state  that  there  is  a  consensus  among  engineers  regarding  these  technologies
and  their  costs  and  benefits.  Table  1  (attached)  provides  such  a  listing  and  is  re-
stricted  to  conventional  technologies  that  are  sold  in  at  least  one  mass-market
model  in  the  U.S.  as  of  2005,  to  avoid  any  controversy  about  technology  readiness
for  the  market  place.  In  addition,  I  have  ignored  the  potential  for  weight  reduction
through the use of alternative materials because of the unfortunate controversy over
the link between weight and safety. The data in the table suggests that a total fuel
economy improvement of about 26 percent in small cars to 28 percent in larger cars
and  light  trucks  is  possible  for  much  of  the  new  car  fleet  with  no  weight  reduction
whatsoever. At the same time it should be noted that all of the technologies are (by
definition)  in  some  vehicles,  so  that  the  fleetwide  benefit  available  relative  to  2004
model  year  vehicles  is  about  two  percent  lower  than  the  estimate  in  the  table.  If
one  were  to  choose  only  those  technologies  that  pay  for  themselves  in  terms  of  fuel
savings  over  50,000  miles  (  a  measure  used  by  manufacturers  to  gauge  consumer
acceptance),  then  the  gasoline  direct  injection  system  would  not  be  included  in  the
list. However, direct injection with lean combustion could be cost effective as it could
double  the  fuel  economy  benefit  from  this  technology  alone  and  eliminate  the  need
to employ cylinder de-activation or variable valve lift. Hence, the available improve-
ment  from  cost  effective  conventional  technology  would  be  about  24  to  26  percent.
Half  of  the  improvement  is  associated  with  engine  technology.  The  technologies
would  add  about  $800  to  $1,000  to  the  retail  price  of  a  vehicle  while  the  value  of
fuel saved over 50,000 miles at $2/gallon would be in the same range.

These estimates are a little lower than the ones derived by the National Academy
of  Sciences  for  two  reasons.  First,  the  choice  of  only  those  technologies  already  in
the market as of 2005 is more restrictive than the definition used by the NAS. Add-
ing  most  of  the  excluded  technologies  like  ‘‘camless  valve  actuation’’  or  ‘‘  variable
compression  ratio’’  will  increase  the  total  available  benefit  but  will  not  change  the
listing of cost-effective technology as these excluded technologies are typically quite
expensive for the benefit delivered. Second, the NAS study was completed four years
ago  and  some  of  the  technologies  on  their  list  have  already  been  widely  adopted  in
the interim period. However, it can be argued that the costs of these excluded tech-
nology  improvements  could  come  down  in  the  future.  A  comparison  of  studies  on
fuel  economy  completed  since  1985  suggests  that  at  any  given  point  in  time,  there
always  appears  to  be  the  potential  to  increase  fuel  economy  by  25  to  30  percent  in
a  cost-effective  way.  As  available  technologies  are  adopted  into  most  new  cars,  new
technologies are developed to lead to this conclusion.

More importantly, I also believe that all of the cost-effective technology in the table
could  be  adopted  under  free  market  conditions  in  most  vehicles  by  2015  if  gasoline
prices do not decline significantly, simply due to the fact these technologies pay for
themselves. As examples, GM has publicly announced that most of the V–8 and V–
6  engines  will  have  cylinder  cutout  in  the  future.  GM  and  Ford  are  collaborating
on a six speed automatic transmission that will be used on most of their front wheel
drive  cars  by  2012.  DaimlerChrysler’s  new  four-cylinder  engine  will  be  equipped
with variable valve timing. Most current Honda models offer variable valve lift sys-
tems.  These  examples  confirm  our  computations  of  cost-effectiveness.  At  the  same
time,  this  does  not  imply  that  2015  fuel  economy  under  free  market  conditions  will
be  25  percent  higher  than  it  is  today.  We  estimate  that  about  half  of  the  improve-
ment  will  counterbalanced  by  consumers  buying  more  luxurious  and  larger  vehicles,
SUV models and four-wheel drive even if fuel prices remain at around $2 per gallon.

If gasoline prices decline in the future to $1.25 per gallon, there may be no improve-
ment in fleet fuel economy at all as some technologies become cost ineffective.
HYBRID AND DIESEL TECHNOLOGY

The  second  question  asks  about  the  prospects  for  diesel  and  hybrid  technology,
and  their  expected  contribution  to  fuel  economy.  Dr.  Greene  of  Oak  Ridge  National
Laboratory  and  I  completed  a  study  of  these  technologies  last  year  on  this  very
question, but because technological changes are happening quickly, I have modified
my answers to reflect new data. I will focus on technology issues and let Dr. Greene
respond  to  market  penetration  issues.  Both  technologies  offer  the  prospect  for  fuel
economy  improvements  of  40  to  50  percent,  more  than  double  the  total  available
from all cost effective conventional technology.

Diesel  engines  are  not  a  new  technology  and  half  of  all  new  cars  sold  in  Europe
are  diesel  powered.  They  are  revolutionary  only  in  the  U.S.  context  due  to  the  dif-
ficulty in meeting emissions standards in force here. Although much has been made
of  the  diesel’s  emissions,  I  am  now  reasonably  confident  that  the  diesel  engine  will
be  able  to  meet  the  stringent  new  Tier  2  emission  standards  in  most  vehicles  in  the
near future. Existing diesel engines can definitely meet this standard with an urea-
SCR  system  and  particulate  trap,  but  vehicles  need  periodic  refueling  with  urea.
Distributing  urea  to  refueling  stations  is  not  an  insurmountable  problem,  but  is  of
some  concern  to  the  EPA.  Other  solutions  that  do  not  require  urea  like  the  NOΧ
adsorber  are  also  close  to  meeting  emission  standards  but  extract  a  fuel  economy
penalty of three to five percent. More exciting developments are in emission control
by  modifying  the  combustion  process  itself.  There  are  three  approaches  being  pur-
sued,  and  the  U.S.  EPA  has  developed  one.  Last  week,  Ford  and  EPA  announced
an agreement to develop this technology for production, demonstrating its potential.
Modern  diesel  engines  with  direct  injection  and  turbocharging  can  improve  fuel
economy by 38 ± 5 percent relative to a gasoline engine of equal size.1 These engines
can  provide  40  to  50  percent  more  mid-range  torque  than  the  gasoline  engine  and
near equal horsepower. In addition, there is evidence from Europe that diesel vehi-
cles  perform  better  on  the  road  than  gasoline  vehicles  and  real-world  (as  opposed
to  EPA  test)  fuel  economy  may  be  about  50  percent  better  than  a  gasoline  vehicle.
However,  the  diesel  engine  (with  advanced  emission  control)  will  have  a  price  pre-
mium of about $2200 for a four cylinder engine used in a compact car to about $3400
for a large V–6 used in a pickup truck. At these prices, the fuel savings over 50,000
miles  will  not  pay  for  the  full  cost,  but  consumers  value  the  torque  and  durability
of  the  engine.  I  should  also  note  that  the  ‘‘conventional’’  technologies  not  related  to
the gasoline engine in Table 1 are also applicable to diesel powered vehicles, so that
the  vehicle  fuel  economy  potential  is  about  50  ±  6  percent.  Our  study  estimated  the
ultimate  market  potential  of  the  diesel  in  the  2015  time  frame  at  about  30  percent
of the market if there is no hybrid competition.

The  hybrid  gasoline—electric  vehicle  has  received  much  attention,  but  there  are
many  kinds  of  hybrids  and  the  terminology  to  describe  them  is  both  confusing  and
biased.  The  Toyota  Prius  is  one  reference  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  ‘‘full’’  hybrid,
and  it  uses  two  high  powered  electric  motors,  a  gasoline  engine  and  a  high  power
battery.  (Ford’s  Escape  hybrid  uses  a  similar  system.)  The  Honda  Civic  and  Accord
hybrids  use  a  different  and  simpler  system  with  one  motor  of  relatively  low  power
and  a  smaller  battery  than  the  one  used  in  the  Toyota  Prius.  GM  and
DaimlerChrysler  currently  offer  a  system  in  a  hybrid  pickup  truck  conceptually
similar  to  the  Honda  system  but  with  a  much  lower  power  battery.  GM  also  plans
to  introduce  a  fourth  type  of  system,  called  a  Belt  drive  Alternator  Starter  (BAS)
system that is significantly cheaper than any of the other systems. All of these types
are hybrids but have quite different price and performance implications.

In general, all hybrids improve fuel economy in city (or stop-and-go) driving by sig-
nificant  amounts,  but  offer  little  or  no  improvement  in  fuel  economy  under  highway
(steady  high  speed)  conditions.  In  addition,  the  hybrid  vehicle’s  fuel  economy  bene-
fits,  even  under  city  driving  conditions,  are  a  function  of  trip  length  and  ambient
conditions.  In  contrast,  the  fuel  economy  benefit  of  the  diesel  is  more  robust  across
all driving conditions.

It  is  difficult  to  provide  a  single  fuel  economy  benefit  number  to  hybrids  even  of
a  particular  type  since  it  is  a  function  of  the  performance  trade-offs  chosen  by  the
manufacturer. ‘‘Full’’ Hybrids using a two electric motor design similar to that used
by  Toyota  and  Ford  can  provide  a  50  to  55  percent  improvement  in  composite  fuel
economy if optimized for maximum fuel efficiency. This improvement includes the ef-
fect  of  the  conventional  technologies  listed  in  Table  1  and  the  benefit  of  hybridiza-
tion alone is about 25 to 30 percent. Such hybrids provide comparable low speed ac-
celeration  but  reduced  continuous  power  for  hill  climb  or  trailer  towing.  Vehicles
that offer no compromise in continuous power and significantly better low speed ac-
celeration will offer a benefit of 30 to 35 percent (again including most conventional
technologies). In a mid-size car for example, we estimate that the additional hybrid
related components will add $5,600 to retail price currently if manufacturers utilize
standard retail markup and expect to earn an average profit margin on these vehi-
cles.  There  are  significant  cost  reductions  likely  to  be  realized  over  the  next  five
years and we estimate that by 2010 prices can be below $3,900. Since the fuel sav-
ings over 50,000 miles are only on the order of $1,300 to $1,500, many believe that
this technology will never succeed in the market even after cost reductions are real-
ized.

1 Europeans  often  quote  a  diesel  fuel  consumption  (the  inverse  of  fuel  economy)  benefit  of  25

to 30 percent, and this is equal to a fuel economy benefit of 33.3 to 42.85 percent.

These  issues  regarding  the  ‘‘full’’  hybrid  have  been  debated  publicly,  but  the  po-
tential of other hybrid designs has received much less attention in the press. Honda
has  introduced  three  hybrid  vehicles  in  the  U.S.  that  have  a  single  electric  motor
of less than half the power of the motors in the Toyota Prius, and an advanced bat-
tery that is half the size of the one in the Prius. Yet, the fuel economy gains in the
Honda  hybrid  vehicles  are  almost  as  good  as  the  ones  from  the  Toyota  hybrids.
Honda has cleverly managed to exploit synergies between engine, transmission and
electric  motor  technology  to  maximize  fuel  economy.  We  estimate  the  cost  of  these
hybrids  to  be  less  than  half  the  cost  the  ‘‘full’’  hybrid  designs,  so  that  future  prices
will  be  relatively  close  to  the  value  of  fuel  saved.  Other  innovative  designs  using
ultra-capacitors  have  been  shown  by  Continental  of  Germany  that  could  be  a  low
cost solution for some types of vehicles. These alternative types of hybrid designs in
synergy with engine technologies could provide fuel economy gains of 30 to 35 percent
with  no  loss  in  performance,  and  will  be  cost  effective  in  terms  of  fuel  savings  over
the  life  of  the  vehicle.  Dr.  Greene’s  analysis  suggests  that  hybrids  of  different  types
can capture 25 percent of the market by 2015, and this figure could be higher with
some of the more innovative designs under study now.

Some analysts have discounted the diesel engine and hybrid powertrain combina-
tion  as  too  expensive,  but  I  do  not  agree.  Some  alternative  cheaper  hybrid  designs
could  make  sense  with  advanced  diesel  engines  by  eliminating  the  need  for  costly
emission  control  equipment  like  NOΧ adsorbers,  partially  offsetting  hybrid  costs.  I
have heard that several European manufacturers are developing hybrid-diesel com-
binations and I anticipate that the first models will be available in the U.S. by 2008.
SAFETY RELATED EFFECTS

The data presented above for conventional and revolutionary technology do not in-
clude any weight or size reduction, so there are no reasons to be concerned for safety.
In addition, both the diesel and hybrid vehicle weigh three to five percent more than
conventional  vehicles,  so  that  there  could  be  positive  benefits  if  weight  is  indeed  a
factor.  I  am  not  a  safety  expert,  but  recent  analyses  sponsored  by  Honda  suggest
that size rather than weight is more important for safety.

In  addition,  the  safety  relationship  to  weight  and  size  is  debated  in  the  context
of injury after a crash has occurred. This committee should be made aware of amaz-
ing new advances in active crash prevention technologies. Technologies being intro-
duced into the marketplace in the near-term include:

— Blind Spot Warning through radar or infra-red detection
— Pre-Crash sensing using radar or vision based technology
— Lane Departure Warning using camera based technology
— Active Lane Keeping systems
— Stability control, soon to be standard on most vehicles
— Rollover prevention on trucks and SUV models
— Rear Vision and Night Vision systems
— Drowsy Driver Detection systems

Indeed,  there  are  plans  to  incorporate  systems  to  completely  sense  the  vehicle
driving  environment  and  warn  the  driver  or  prevent  a  crash.  I  believe  that  active
safety technology has the potential to completely change the safety debate and remove
any  link  between  fuel  economy  and  safety,  and  hope  that  this  committee  will  exam-
ine these technologies more closely.
GOVERNMENT POLICIES

I  was  also  asked  to  comment  on  government  policies  to  accelerate  technology  in-
troduction.  I  am  aware  of  public  initiatives  to  raise  CAFE  standards  with  the
premise  that  this  policy  has  worked  in  the  past.  While  the  CAFE  standards  did
achieve the goals, there is no question that the current form of the standard requir-
ing all manufacturers to meet the same MPG target disadvantaged domestic manu-
facturers.  Dr  Greene  and  I  have  investigated  other  forms  of  the  standard  such  as
size  or  weight  based  standards  and  these  seem  to  be  more  equitable  in  treatment  of
different  manufacturers.  However,  no  form  of  standard  is  without  some  drawbacks,
and  all  are  susceptible  to  ‘‘gaming.’’  I  am  also  hesitant  to  suggest  the  European
method that set a ‘‘voluntary’’ fuel consumption improvement target for all manufac-
turers  and  let  the  manufacturers  negotiate  individual  targets  between  themselves.
I  understand  some  strains  are  being  caused  between  European  manufacturers  by
this  agreement,  and  intra-industry  agreements  could  be  construed  as  anti-competi-
tive behavior under U.S. laws. I will let others on the panel comment on standards
and focus my attention on promoting technology for fuel economy.

41

The  consumer  side  of  the  equation  should  also  not  be  neglected.  Consumers  ap-
pear  to  value  other  attributes,  notably  size,  luxury  features  and  performance  over
fuel economy, and the appeal for SUV models has not diminished much even at the
current gasoline price of $2 per gallon. The market share for light trucks continues
to increase and reached a record of almost 55 percent of the total light vehicle mar-
ket  in  2004.  Cars  and  light  trucks  with  astounding  horsepower  ratings  of  400,  500
and  600  HP  are  in  demand  in  a  country  where  the  national  speed  limit  rarely  ex-
ceeds  70  mph.  These  trends  will  serve  to  eventually  erase  the  benefits  of  any
amount of technology introduction. Hence, future fuel economy related efforts should
include  efforts  directed  at  consumer  motivation  to  purchase  more  efficient  rather
than more powerful or larger vehicles. This has always been a difficult area for Con-
gress, as any restriction on consumer choice appears politically unacceptable.

Just  a  few  years  ago,  many  economists  believed  that  raising  fuel  prices  alone
would  solve  this  problem  of  consumer  motivation.  Some  computations  purported  to
show  that  gasoline  savings  equivalent  to  a  25  percent  increase  in  CAFE  standards
could  be  obtained  by  raising  the  fuel  price  to  $1.75  (or  by  about  50  cents)  at  that
time. It can now be demonstrated from U.S. data from 2003–2004 that the assumed
elasticities of consumer response to gasoline prices for vehicle choice and vehicle use
were in error, by almost an order of magnitude. The Canadian experience with high
fuel prices for the last 20 years also proves the same point. Hence, increasing taxes
on gasoline as the primary conservation measure is not a particularly powerful strat-
egy  unless  very  large  price  increases  ($2  to  $3)  are  contemplated.  At  the  same  time,
higher gasoline prices do make some modest contribution to saving fuel and can set
the  stage  for  making  higher  priced  fuel  efficient  technology  more  palatable  to  the
consumer, i.e., it may be a necessary but not a sufficient condition.

Subsidies  and  fees  for  fuel  efficiency  or  fuel-efficient  technology  to  motivate  con-
sumer purchase are a common suggestion, and there are some subsidies now avail-
able for hybrid vehicles. I believe that the experience has shown technology specific
credit or subsidy programs to be quite unpredictable in supporting the best outcome.
For  example,  California’s  current  ZEV  mandate  provides  credits  to  hybrid  vehicles
as a function of electric motor power and battery voltage, independent of the actual
fuel economy or emissions results attained by a specific design. In future, this could
have  the  effect  of  promoting  more  expensive  designs  and  disfavoring  less  expensive
but more innovative designs that provides a similar outcome. I also believe that die-
sel  and  hybrid  technologies  are  not  in  direct  competition,  as  the  primary  benefits  of
hybrids accrue to passenger vehicles which operate mostly under city driving condi-
tions. Diesel technology is most useful for vehicles that carry loads, tow trailers oc-
casionally,  and/or  operate  primarily  on  the  highway.  Hence,  the  availability  of  both
diesel and hybrid technologies in the marketplace would extend benefits to different
groups of consumers with different needs.

I  would  suggest  tax  rebates  or  subsidies  for  fuel  efficient  vehicles  that  are  inde-
pendent of technology, be it advanced diesel, gasoline direct injection, hybrid or some
combination.  These  subsidies  could  be  phased  out  over  a  10-year  period,  and  the
main purpose would be to reduce manufacturer’s risk of investing in the production
of a high fuel economy technology that is rejected by the consumer.

Thank you for your attention. I will be pleased to answer any questions the com-

mittee may have for me.

BIOGRAPHY FOR K.G. DULEEP

As  Managing  Director  at  EEA,  Mr.  K.G.  Duleep  has  been  involved  with  auto-
motive  technology,  fuel  economy,  and  emissions  issues  for  nearly  25  years.  He  has
directed  a  number  of  studies  evaluating  new  technologies  for  vehicular  engine  and
fuel combinations (including methanol, natural gas, and other alternative fueled ve-
hicles).  These  studies  have  compared  the  technical  feasibility,  economics,  perform-
ance,  maintenance,  and  air  emissions  impacts  of  alternative  vehicle  technologies.
Mr. Duleep has completed projects for the U.S. Federal and State governments, and
for  several  other  countries  (notably  Canada  and  Australia)  where  his  technology
evaluations and forecasts have formed the basis for fuel economy related initiatives
and regulations. Mr. Duleep has testified on transportation technology issues for the
U.S. Congress during debates on the Clean Air Act and CAFE (fuel economy) stand-
ards during the 1990s.

In  2000,  Mr.  Duleep  supported  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences’  Committee  on
the  Effectiveness  and  Impact  of  CAFE  Standards  by  providing  information  to  the
committee  on  the  availability,  cost  and  benefit  of  several  automotive  technologies.
Much of the data on the cost of fuel economy and alternative fuel technology avail-
able  in  the  public  domain  can  be  traced  to  his  work  for  the  Department  of  Energy.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MICHAEL  J.  STANTON,  VICE  PRESIDENT
OF  GOVERNMENT  AFFAIRS,  ALLIANCE  OF  AUTOMOBILE
MANUFACTURERS
Mr. STANTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I  represent  the  Alliance  of  Automobile  Manufacturers,  which  is
BMW,  DaimlerChrysler,  Ford,  GM,  Toyota,  Mazda,  Mitsubishi,
Porsche,  and  Volkswagen  of  America.  So  it  is  a  broad  group  of
international manufacturers.

And  the  Alliance  supports  efforts  to  create  an  effective  energy
policy based on broad market-oriented principles. Policies that pro-
mote  research  and  development  and  accelerate  the  deployment  of
advanced  technologies  by  providing  customer-based  incentives
should be the foundation for these efforts. This focus leverages the
intense  competition  of  automobile  manufacturers  worldwide.  Com-
petition drives automakers to develop and introduce technologies as
rapidly  as  possible  to  meet  the  demands  and  needs  of  customers.
The  auto  industry  is  committed  to  developing  and  utilizing
emerging technologies to produce cleaner, safer, and more fuel-effi-
cient  cars  and  light  trucks.  The  NAS,  in  its  2001  report  to  Con-
gress,  cited  a  number  of  promising  technologies  that  are  being  de-
veloped  for  use  in  vehicles.  The  report  notes  that  they  fall  into  a
variety  of  categories,  from  production  intent  to  emerging.  In  many
cases,  the  production  intent  technologies  are  already  in  vehicles.
The  emerging  technologies  are  ones  that  may  achieve  significant
penetration  in  the  market  if  economic  and  regulatory  conditions
permit, and in some cases, if there are engineering breakthroughs.
All  of  this  suggests  that  purchasing  a  course  of—or  pursuing  a
course of incentivizing the introduction of technologies to accelerate
their  implementation  would  be  more  effective  than  attempting  to
effectively mandate their use.

Auto  manufacturers  are  working  on  advanced  longer-term  tech-
nologies,  such  as  hybrid,  clean  diesel,  and  internal  combustion  en-
gines and fuel cells. These efforts may lead to substantial improve-
ments  in  efficiency  and  emissions  performance,  all,  we  hope,  with-
out  sacrificing  safety,  utility,  comfort,  or  performance.  Fuel  cell
technology, or liquid hydrogen powered ICEs, also serve as a poten-
tial path to move away from a petroleum-dependent transportation
sector.  Successful  introduction  of  these  new  and  emerging  tech-
nologies  all  share  the  need  for  cooperative  efforts  that  bring  to-
gether  all  of  the  stakeholders,  including  auto  makers,  energy  pro-
viders,  government  policymakers,  and  most  important,  consumers.
The  Alliance  supports  enactment  of  consumer  tax  credits  for  the
purchase  of  these  advanced  technology  vehicles.  These  credits  will
help offset the initial higher cost until greater volumes make them
less expensive to produce and purchase. The Alliance believes that
the  overall  concepts  and  provisions  for  consumer  tax  incentives
found  in  last  year’s  conference  report  for  the  Energy  Bill  are  the

43

right  approach  and  would  benefit  consumers.  And  I  am  pleased  to
say  that  yesterday  Congressman  Camp  introduced  similar  legisla-
tion,  and  we  hope  that  the  Committee  Members  would  be  able  to
support it.

CAFE  levels  are  critical  to  auto  makers  for  a  variety  of  reasons.
First,  if  standards  are  too  high,  they  will  preclude  vehicle  at-
tributes  that  can  put  the  manufacturer  at  odds  with  their  cus-
tomers.  Second,  the  level  of  CAFE  standards  can  result  in  unin-
tended  consequences,  such  as  the  adverse  safety  consequences  of
pushing  manufacturers  to  making  vehicles  lighter  and  smaller.
Third,  there  are  competitive  implications  for  some  manufacturers
relative  to  others  due  solely  to  the  mix  of  vehicles  that  are  offered
and  sold.  For  instance,  a  manufacturer  specializing  in  large,  high-
performance  vehicles  will  have  a  more  difficult  challenge  than  a
full-line  manufacturer,  and  that  full-line  manufacturer  will  have  a
more  difficult  challenge  than  a  limited-line  manufacturer  on  com-
pacts  and  sub-compact  vehicles.  And  finally,  for  consumers  sen-
sitive  to  costs,  fuel  economy  gains  must  be  compared  to  the  in-
creased costs for their new vehicle purchase decisions.

To summarize, Mr. Chairman, the Alliance believes that we must
continue our efforts to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, which
is one of the reasons we support the President’s Hydrogen Fuel Ini-
tiative.  In  the  near  term,  Alliance  members  will  continue  to  com-
pete with advanced technology vehicles, such as hybrids, clean die-
sel,  and  alternative  fuel  vehicles.  Meanwhile,  we  will  continue  to
work  with  NHTSA  as  it  fulfills  its  congressional  mandate  to  set
new light truck vehicle CAFE standards at their maximum feasible
level.

Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Stanton follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. STANTON

Mr. Chairman,

Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Committee on Science regard-
ing  fuel  efficient  technologies  for  motor  vehicles.  I  represent  the  Alliance  of  Auto-
mobile  Manufacturers,  a  trade  association  of  nine  car  and  light-truck  manufactur-
ers.  Our  member  companies  include  BMW  Group,  DaimlerChrysler  Corporation,
Ford  Motor  Company,  General  Motors  Corporation,  Mazda,  Mitsubishi,  Porsche,
Toyota Motor North America and Volkswagen of America.

Alliance  member  companies  have  more  than  600,000  employees  in  the  United
States, with more than 230 manufacturing facilities in 35 states. Overall, a Univer-
sity of Michigan study found that the entire automobile industry creates more than
6.6 million direct and spin-off jobs in all 50 states and produces almost $243 billion
in payroll compensation annually.

The  Alliance  supports  efforts  to  create  an  effective  energy  policy  based  on  broad,
market-oriented principles. Policies that promote research and development and ac-
celerate  the  deployment  of  advanced  technologies  by  providing  customer-based  in-
centives  should  set  the  foundation  for  these  efforts.  This  focus  on  ‘‘accelerating  the
implementation  of  advanced  technologies’’  leverages  the  intense  competition  of  the
automobile  manufacturers  worldwide.  Competition  drives  automakers  to  develop
and introduce breakthrough technologies as rapidly as possible to meet the demands
and needs of consumers.

According to EPA data, the results of these efforts have been steady fuel efficiency
increases of nearly two percent per year on average from 1975 to 2003 for both cars
and light trucks. Fuel efficiency is a measure of the energy needed to move a given
mass a specified distance. Fuel efficiency has been increased through improvements
in  aerodynamics,  powertrains  and  reductions  in  accessory  losses—in  essence,
through  the  use  of  the  technologies  of  concern  to  the  Committee  and  mentioned  in

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

reports by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). As a result, the average vehicle
each  year,  everything  else  being  equal,  consumes  about  two  percent  less  fuel  than
it did the year previously.

To  accomplish  these  great  results,  the  auto  industry  spending  on  R&D  each  year
is  approximately  $18.4  billion,  with  much  of  it  in  the  high  tech  sector.  In  fact,  the
University  of  Michigan  study  noted  earlier  stated  the  following:  ‘‘The  level  of  auto-
motive R&D spending and the relatively high employment of research scientists and
engineers  in  the  U.S.  auto  industry  has  traditionally  earned  a  place  in  any  U.S.
Government  listing  of  high  technology  industries  generally  thought  to  be  central  to
the long-term performance of the U.S. economy.’’

The  auto  industry  is  committed  to  developing  and  utilizing  ‘‘emerging’’  tech-
nologies to produce cleaner, safer, and more fuel efficient cars and light trucks. The
NAS, in its 2001 report to Congress, ‘‘Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards,’’ cited a number of promising technologies that are
being  developed  for  use  in  vehicles.  The  report  notes  that  they  fall  into  a  variety
of categories—from ‘‘production intent’’ to ‘‘emerging.’’ In many cases, the production
intent  technologies  have  already  begun  to  be  introduced  into  vehicles.  The  ‘‘emerg-
ing’’ technologies are ones that may achieve significant penetration into the market
over  10  or  more  years,  IF  economic  and  regulatory  conditions  permit  and  at  times
ONLY  IF  engineering  ‘‘breakthroughs’’  are  achieved.  All  of  this  suggests  to  us  that
pursuing a course of incentivizing the introduction of technologies to accelerate their
implementation  would  be  more  effective  than  attempting  to  effectively  mandate
their use.

Auto  manufacturers  are  also  working  on  advanced  longer-term  technologies  such
as  hybrid,  clean  diesel,  and  hydrogen  powered  vehicles,  including  fuel  cells  and  in-
ternal  combustion  engines  (ICE).  These  efforts  may  lead  to  substantial  improve-
ments  in  efficiency  and  emissions  performance—all,  we  hope,  without  sacrificing
safety, utility, and performance. Fuel cell technology, or liquid hydrogen powered ve-
hicles  using  an  ICE,  also  serve  as  a  potential  to  move  away  from  a  petroleum  de-
pendent  transportation  sector.  Successful  introduction  of  these  new  and  emerging
technologies  all  share  the  need  for  cooperative  efforts  that  bring  all  the  key  stake-
holders  together. . .including  the  automakers,  energy  providers,  government  policy
makers and most importantly, the consumers.

The  NAS  summarized  the  diversity  of  demand  and  priorities  in  the  marketplace
when  it  stated  that  ‘‘automotive  manufacturers  must  optimize  the  vehicle  and  its
powertrain to meet the sometimes-conflicting demands of customer-desired perform-
ance, fuel economy goals, emissions standards, safety requirements and vehicle cost
within  the  broad  range  of  operating  conditions  under  which  the  vehicle  will  be
used.’’

What  this  says  is  a  fact  that  the  auto  industry  must  deal  with  every  day  in  de-
signing  and  producing  vehicles—the  customer  is  in  the  driver’s  seat.  This  helps  ex-
plain  why,  when  fuel  efficiency  has  been  increasing  by  two  percent  per  year,  fuel
economy  (the  miles  per  gallon  a  vehicle  obtains)  has  not  kept  pace.  Consumers  are
not placing as high a value on fuel economy as they are on other vehicle attributes
(e.g.,  price  and  safety).  Thus,  while  vehicles  continue  to  get  more  fuel  efficient,  the
miles per gallon obtained by a given vehicle or the vehicle fleet as a whole, has not
increased  as  much  because  consumers  are  either  choosing  larger  and  heavier  vehi-
cles or choosing vehicle attributes such as larger engines and advanced safety equip-
ment, that dampens the increase in fuel economy.

Market-based incentives ultimately will help consumers deal with the initial high-
er cost barriers of advanced technologies during early market introduction. The im-
portant consideration here is to increase demand, bringing more energy efficient ve-
hicles into the marketplace. This will help drive cost reduction as economies of scale
are achieved in a timelier fashion.

As a result, the Alliance supports enactment of consumer tax credits for the pur-
chase of advanced technology vehicles. These credits will help offset the initial high-
er  costs  of  advanced  technology  and  alternative  fuel  vehicles  until  further  techno-
logical advancements and greater volumes make them less expensive to produce and
purchase.  The  Alliance  believes  that  the  overall  concepts  and  provisions  for  con-
sumer tax incentives found in last year’s energy bill conference report are the right
approach and would benefit American consumers.

Unfortunately,  there  have  also  been  Congressional  efforts  in  the  past  to  consider
amendments  to  the  energy  bill  to  increase  CAFE  standards.  The  Alliance  has  op-
posed  these  attempts  to  Congressionally  set  arbitrarily  higher  CAFE  levels.  The
original CAFE program was designed to allow the Department of Transportation to
set new standards by conducting rule-makings that consider the ‘‘maximum feasible
fuel economy level’’ that is achievable for a given model year.

Two  years  ago,  the  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA)
used this authority to set higher standards for the 2005–07 model year light trucks.
The NHTSA rule increased the standards by 1.5 mpg over that period—to 22.2 mpg
by 2007—the largest increase in 20 years. NHTSA set these standards after consid-
ering key elements such as technological feasibility, cost, safety, emissions controls,
consumer choice, the need of the Nation to conserve energy, and the effect on Amer-
ican  jobs.  While  the  standard  for  2007  may  not  be  viewed  by  some  as  sufficiently
‘‘aggressive,’’  NHTSA  stated  in  the  preamble  to  the  final  rule  that  it  will  pose  a
‘‘substantial challenge’’ to at least one of our member companies.

In its rule-making, NHTSA noted that advanced fuel saving technologies, such as
hybrid electrics and advanced clean diesels, could substantially enhance the average
fuel economy of the American light vehicle fleet as even more advanced technologies,
such as fuel cells, are being developed.

Where CAFE levels are set is critical to automakers for a variety of reasons. First,
there  are  competitive  implications  for  some  manufacturers,  relative  to  others,  due
solely  to  the  mix  of  vehicles  that  are  offered  and  sold.  The  current  system  empha-
sizes  these  disparate  impacts  by  more  severely  challenging  manufacturers  that  al-
ready  provide  vehicles  in  the  heavier  and  larger  segments  of  the  vehicle  fleet,  such
as  full-size  SUVs  and  pick-up  trucks.  While  there  are  approaches  to  restructuring
the  CAFE  program  that  can  help  address  these  concerns,  the  details  of  imple-
menting  them  are  critical  and  must  be  fully  explored  to  avoid  creating  a  system
with  new  competitive  consequences.  The  Administration  is  currently  examining  a
number of CAFE restructuring proposals through rule-making and the Alliance and
its Member companies are actively involved in the process.

Second, the level of CAFE standards can result in unintended consequences, such
as the adverse safety consequences of pushing manufacturers to make vehicles light-
er  and  smaller.  The  NAS  report  noted  the  increased  fatalities  that  are  attributable
to  the  impacts  of  downweighting  and  downsizing  due  to  past  CAFE  standards  and
urged care in setting future levels to avoid aggravating this effect. The report said,
‘‘If  an  increase  in  fuel  economy  is  effected  by  a  system  that  encourages  either
downweighting or the production and sale of more small cars, some additional traffic
fatalities  would  be  expected.  For  fuel  economy  regulations  not  to  have  an  adverse
impact  on  safety,  they  must  be  implemented  using  increased  fuel  efficiency  tech-
nology.’’

Third, the emphasis of customers on improving the safety of the vehicles they pur-
chase  results  in  automakers  adding  more  equipment  to  provide  safety  in  collisions.
Safety improvements continuously add weight to vehicles, and the heavier the vehi-
cle,  the  more  energy  it  takes  to  move  it  down  the  road,  resulting  in  a  decrease  in
fuel  economy.  This  is  a  classic  dilemma  and  reflects  the  tradeoffs  that  automakers
face  constantly  in  designing  vehicles  to  achieve  improvements  in  safety,  fuel  effi-
ciency and emission performance.

Finally,  for  consumers  sensitive  to  cost,  fuel  economy  gains  must  be  compared  to
the increased investment costs and risks in their new vehicle purchase decision. As-
suming  a  fuel  cost  of  $2  per  gallon,  a  20  percent  increase  in  vehicle  fuel  efficiency
offers an annual fuel savings of under $150. This cost must be weighed against the
convenience,  utility  and  performance  of  the  alternative.  As  automakers,  we  are
keenly  aware  of  the  importance  of  consumer  choices  and  the  challenges  we  have  to
deliver  new  technologies  that  meet  their  affordability,  performance  and  utility
needs.

So where is the industry headed:

Fuel Cell Vehicles

A  promising  long-term  technology  offers  breakthrough  fuel  economy  improve-
ments, zero emissions and a shift away from petroleum-based fuels. From a vehicle
perspective,  hydrogen-fueled  fuel  cells  offer  the  biggest  improvement  in  efficiency
and  emissions  but  at  high  cost  and  with  major  infrastructure  challenges.  On-board
hydrogen  storage  also  presents  some  difficulty.  The  gasoline  infrastructure  is  well
established,  but  gasoline  reformers  are  the  least  developed  and  the  most  costly  of
reformer technology.

A  robust  fuel  cell  commercialization  plan  incorporates  breakthroughs  and  com-
plementary research in stationary power units. A primary challenge in the introduc-
tion of fuel cells into America’s light vehicle passenger and truck fleets are the pack-
aging restrictions of size and weight.
Hybrid-Electric Vehicles

Hybrid-electric  vehicles  offer  significant  improvements  in  fuel  economy  and  in
tailpipe  emissions.  These  products  capture  power  through  regenerative  braking.
When  decelerating  an  internal  combustion  vehicle,  the  brakes  convert  the  vehicle’s

46

kinetic energy into heat, which is lost to the air. By contrast, a decelerating hybrid
vehicle can convert kinetic energy into stored energy that can be reused during the
next acceleration. Hybrid vehicles do not require additional investment in fuel infra-
structure which helps reflect their potential for near-term acceptance.
Advanced Lean Burn Technology Vehicles

Vehicles that are powered by advanced lean burn technology such as clean, direct
injection diesels offer greater fuel economy and better performance. The auto indus-
try  is  working  now  to  introduce  technologies  that  will  allow  diesel  automobiles  to
meet  the  EPA’s  Tier  2  emissions  regulations.  These  types  of  vehicles,  widespread
in  Europe  today,  could  provide  fuel  economy  gains  in  excess  of  25  percent  above
comparable conventional vehicles.
Internal Combustion Engine powered by liquid hydrogen

Another  promising  and  enabling  technology  towards  a  hydrogen  economy  are  hy-
drogen-powered ICEs. The concept of using hydrogen in internal combustion engines
offers  several  advantages:  near  zero  emissions,  maintaining  the  utility,  flexibility,
and driving dynamic of today’s automobile and helping to promote a hydrogen fuel-
ing infrastructure.
Battery Electric Vehicles

Vehicles that utilize stored energy from ‘‘plug-in’’ rechargeable batteries offer zero
emissions  from  the  vehicle.  However,  battery  electric  vehicles  continue  to  face
weight,  energy  density,  and  cost  challenges  that  limit  their  customer  range  and  af-
fordability.

Beyond gasoline, the auto industry is working with a variety of suppliers of alter-
native  fuels.  In  fact,  the  industry  already  offers  more  than  25  vehicles  powered  by
alternative  fuels.  Approximately  three  million  of  these  vehicles  are  on  the  road
today and more are coming. Today, we find vehicles that use:
• Natural gas, which reduces carbon monoxide emissions;
• Ethanol,  a  renewable  fuel  domestically  produced  with  the  longer  term  poten-

tial to substantially reduce greenhouse gases;

• Liquefied  petroleum  gas  (propane),  the  most  prevalent  of  the  alternative

fuels, which reduces VOC emissions; and

• For  the  future,  liquid  hydrogen,  which  has  the  potential  to  emit  nearly  zero

pollutants depending on feedstock.

One  of  the  key  hurdles  to  overcome  in  commercializing  alternative  fuel  vehicles
is the lack of fueling infrastructure. For nearly a century, infrastructure has focused
primarily  on  gasoline  and  diesel  products.  Infrastructure  and  fuel  incentives  will
help the distributors overcome the costs to establish the alternative fuel outlets and
support distributors during initial lower sales volumes as the number of alternative
fuel vehicles increases.

As  you  can  tell,  the  automobile  companies  are  constantly  competing  for  the  next
breakthrough innovations. All manufacturers have advanced technology programs to
improve  vehicle  fuel  efficiency,  lower  emissions  and  increase  motor  vehicle  safety.
These are not ‘‘pie in the sky’’ concepts on a drawing board. In fact, many companies
have advanced technology vehicles in the marketplace right now or have announced
production  plans  for  the  near  future.  That  is  why  now  is  the  perfect  time  for  the
enactment  of  consumer  tax  credits  to  help  spur  the  purchase  of  these  new  vehicles
which years of research and development have made possible.

Thank you.

STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID L. GREENE, OAK RIDGE NATIONAL
LABORATORY,  CENTER  FOR  TRANSPORTATION  ANALYSIS,
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH CENTER
Dr.  GREENE.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Good  afternoon,  and

good afternoon to Members and staff and guests here.

I  am  pleased  to  be  here,  and  I  hope  I  can  help  advance  the  dis-

Could I have the first slide, please?
[Slide.]
I have been asked three questions that pertain to policy.
The first question, essentially, is what are the policy options and
what are their pluses and minuses. I have dealt with this, or tried
to, at some length in my testimony. I will just try to hit some high
points here.

The second question is directly aimed at whether or not the gov-
ernment can encourage adoption of fuel-efficient technologies with-
out  leading  manufacturers  to  make  vehicles  less  safe.  My  simple
answer to that is yes, but I will elaborate on that in a moment.

And  can  the  government  encourage  the  adoption  of  technologies
to  improve  fuel  economy  without  significant  negative  impacts  on
manufacturers?  And  this  is  more  complicated,  but  I  think  things
can be done to improve the current system, let me say that.

Well, there are lots of standards that can be used, and there are
lots of policies that can be used to encourage fuel economy improve-
ment.  And  countries—almost  every  developed  country  around  the
world  has  some  form  of  fuel  economy  standards,  and  almost  all  of
them  are  different.  We  have  the  CAFE  standards.  Japan  has
weight-based standards. China is adopting weight-based standards.
The  European  Union  has  comprehensive  voluntary  standards,
which  has  some  advantages  for  them.  My  bottom  line  here  is  I
think there are many ways to do this and to do it effectively. There
are some pluses and minuses.

For  example,  I  think  the  one  criticism  of  the  CAFE  standards
that  stands  up  to  analysis  is  that  they  did  have  differential  com-
petitive  impacts,  which  were  more  onerous  for  the  Big  Three  U.S.
manufacturers  to  meet  than  for  foreign  manufacturers.  On  the
other hand, the situation in the auto market has changed consider-
ably. The largest manufacturers now are much more supplying ve-
hicles  across  the  board,  as  compared  with  back  in  1975  when  the
foreign manufacturers were highly specialized in small vehicles. So
these  differential  impacts  will  be  inherently  smaller  today  than
they  were  back  then,  and  there  are  further  ways  to  mitigate  them
by having class-based standards or attribute-based standards.

The  chief  problem  I  see  with  the  CAFE  standards  is  that  once
you  meet  the  standards,  then  you  stop.  There  is  not  a  continuing

incentive to improve fuel economy to add technologies as they come
along.  This  kind  of  problem  can  be  addressed  by  market-based  in-
centives, such as feebate systems, which consist of a fee charged for
vehicles that are below a pivot point or a certain fuel economy level
and  a  rebate  or  incentive  that  are  given  to  vehicles  above  that
level.  Pivot  points  can  be  chosen,  such  there  is  one  for  the  entire
marketplace,  one  for  passenger  cars,  one  for  light  trucks,  or  per-
haps  many  classes  of  vehicles.  This  provides  ongoing  incentives  to
continue  to  adopt  fuel  economy  technology  in  order  to  avoid  a  fee
or gain a rebate.

Other  market-based  approaches  include  gasoline  taxes,  and  I
would  like  to  say  that  our  National  Research  Council  report,  once
again,  recommended  higher  fuel  taxes.  I  think  that  is  still  a  good
idea.  It  may  be  unpopular,  but  I  think  it  is  incumbent  on  people
like myself and like my colleague, Dr. Portney, to recommend such
things when we get the opportunity.

I  would  like  to  spend  a  moment  trying  to  elaborate  on  the  point
that the Chairman made earlier that there is market failure in the
market  for  fuel  economy  and  to  see  if  I  can  help  us  understand
what the nature of that is.

What  matters  to  the  consumer  of  an  automobile  is  not  the  total
value of fuel savings that fuel-efficient technology will provide, nor
is it solely the price increase that will come about when these tech-
nologies  are  added  to  the  vehicle.  Rather,  it  is  the  difference  be-
tween  the  two,  the  net  value:  the  fuel  savings  minus  the  price  in-
crease.  I  show  here  on  the  higher  graph  data  from  our  own  Na-
tional Research Council study. The dotted red line is the cost of im-
proving  the  fuel  economy  using  the  technologies  we  described  in
the  study  of  a  typical  28-mile-per-gallon  passenger  car.  The  solid
black  line  is  the  discounted  present  value  of  fuel  savings  that
would be realized over the life of the car. I see some people are al-
ready  eyes  glazing  over  with  that  kind  of  terminology.  But  essen-
tially, that is the value of these fuel savings to a perfectly rational
economic  consumer  who  calculates  out  exactly  what  he  is  going  to
do  and  how  much  he  is  going  to  save  over  the  life  of  the  car.  By
the way, the evidence is there probably are no such consumers out
there.

But  in  any  case,  what  is  of  interest  to  the  consumer  is  the  dif-
ference  between  the  two,  which  is  that  lower  curve,  which  doesn’t
vary by more than plus or minus $200 or $250 over approximately
50  percent  increase  in  fuel  economy.  I  think  this  explains,  given
the uncertainty in the consumer’s mind about what those fuel econ-
omy  numbers  on  the  car  really  mean  and  what  the  future  price  of
gasoline  is  going  to  be.  It  is  no  surprise  that  this  is  not  an  impor-
tant  issue  to  the  typical  car  buyer.  This  is  way  down  the  list  of
things that are of importance.

On the other hand, to achieve this kind of dramatic improvement
in  fuel  economy,  manufacturers  have  to  completely  redesign  their
vehicles,  invest  billions  of  dollars  in  retooling,  and  it  is  a  very
risky, expensive proposition for something that their customers are
barely interested in. This, I think, is the principle reason why fuel

economy  technologies  today  do  not  get  incorporated  into  vehicles
for the purpose of improving fuel economy.

Now many in the industry believe that consumers only count the
first  three  years  of  fuel  savings  and  not  the  fuel  savings  over  the
life  of  the  car.  The  lower  graph  shows  that  same  net  value  curve
if you only count the first three years of fuel savings, and obviously
at that point, there is nothing worth doing. So that explains, if that
is  your  perspective,  on  why  you  would  not  improve  the  fuel  econ-
omy of vehicles.

Turning  to  this  question  of  whether  the  government  can  encour-
age  fuel-efficient  technology  without  harming  safety,  first,  let  me
say  the  question  of  fuel  economy  and  weight  reduction  is  greatly
exaggerated.  According  to  data  published  by  the  Environmental
Protection  Agency,  the  average  light-duty  vehicle,  combined  pas-
senger  car  and  light  truck  fleet  vehicles,  sold  in  2004  weighed  six
pounds more than the average light-duty vehicles sold in 1975. Yet
it  got  58  percent,  almost  60  percent  better  fuel  economy.  So  we
have  improved  the  fuel  economy  of  vehicles  over  1975  levels  by  60
percent.  The  vehicles  weigh  six  pounds  more  than  they  did  back
then.  The  issue  that  weight  reduction  is  the  chief  method  of  im-
proving  fuel  economy  is,  using  Mark  Twain’s  phrase,  greatly  exag-
gerated.

Now  there  is  still  this  issue  of  whether  they  are  downsizing
weight  reduction,  which  did  occur  in  the  early  years  following  the
passage  of  the  Fuel  Economy  Standards  in  1975  and  the  price
shocks  in  ’73  and  ’74,  whether  that  was  harmful  to  safety.  At  the
time the National Research Council report was written, there were
no scientific studies contradicting the prevailing view that increas-
ing  fuel  economy  led  to  smaller,  lighter  cars,  which  led  to  greater
fatalities. There are now four scientific studies that have been pub-
lished,  which  do  contradict  that  view,  and  these  studies  indicate
that, one, there is no link between fuel economy and traffic safety,
and two, that, in the case of the studies done by DRI and supported
by Honda of America, it indicates that increasing the weight of ve-
hicles  while  maintaining  size  would  be—actually  be  harmful  to
safety. Decreasing the weight of vehicles somewhat while maintain-
ing the size of vehicles would be beneficial to safety.

So  now  I  think  we  have  something  we  didn’t  have  at  the  time
of the NRC report, which is scientific evidence that this link is not
what  we  thought  it  was  and  that  we  can  proceed  to  improve  fuel
economy without harming safety.

Next slide, please.
[Slide.]
This  is  just  a  slide  which  illustrates  the  point.  The  upper  line
shows  total  highway  traffic  fatalities,  which,  by  and  large,  de-
creased  over  time,  while  fuel  economy  was  improving.  Your  eyes
don’t  deceive  you:  fuel  economy  increased,  traffic  fatalities  went
down.  And  the  issue  is  a  lot  more  complicated  than  that,  but  I
think that does summarize, reasonably well, what was achieved.

With  respect  to  differential  impacts,  there  are  many  things  that
can cause differential impacts on firms from a fuel economy stand-
ard  or  any  kind  of  market-based  fuel  economy  policy  as  well.  The
one that I think is most salient is the product mix, which does dif-
fer,  to  some  extent,  across  manufacturers  and  will  be  an  issue.
There  are  ways  to  mitigate  this  with  class-based  standards,  at-
tribute-based  standards,  and  adding  flexibility  features, 
like
tradable  credits  that  we  recommended  in  the  National  Research
Council report.

Final slide, please.
[Slide.]
I  think  all  I  wanted  to  say  from  this  slide  is  to  reiterate  what
Dr.  Portney  said.  That  is  that  it  is  extremely  important  to  allow
adequate lead time for design changes so that manufacturers have
time to do the proper engineering and the resources to do the prop-
er  engineering  and  to  turn  over  their  productive  capital  in  an  or-
derly  fashion.  It  is  also  important  to  set  the  standards  at  levels
that  are  close  to  being  cost-effective  from  the  point  of  view  of  fuel
savings so that they do not create excessive market distortions.

[Slide.]
With that, let me go to the last slide and just say thank you very

much, and I will be happy to answer any questions.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID L. GREENE

1. WHAT  ARE  THE  POLICY  OPTIONS  FOR  ENCOURAGING  THE  ADOP-
TION  OF  FUEL  EFFICIENT  TECHNOLOGIES  AND  THEIR  ADVAN-
TAGES AND DISADVANTAGES?
There are many ways to structure policies to achieve significant increases in fuel
economy effectively and efficiently. I will focus on five below. It is possible to create
policies  that  are  reasonably  effective,  efficient,  and  fair.  Our  own  experience  with
our CAFE standards and difficulties we have had updating the CAFE law indicates
that  we  should  also  prefer  policies  that  provide  a  continuing  incentive  to  improve
fuel economy.

Following the oil crises of the 1970s, nearly every developed economy in the world
adopted  fuel  economy  standards  in  some  form  (IEA,  1984;  1991).  Though  the  forms
and means of implementing standards varied, and although fuel economy standards
have  been  criticized  on  a  variety  of  grounds,  all  these  standards  were  effective  in
raising  fuel  economy  levels.  Fuel  economy  standards  contributed  to  curbing  the
growth  of  world  oil  demand  in  the  1980s  and,  in  combination  with  the  market  re-
sponse  to  higher  oil  prices  led  to  the  OPEC  cartel’s  loss  of  control  over  world  oil
markets in 1986. We do know how to reduce dependence on petroleum and we have
done  so  effectively  in  the  past.  The  combination  of  higher  oil  prices  and  policies
aimed at increasing energy efficiency led to almost 15 years of low oil prices (Figure
1). Unfortunately, after these efforts were successful and oil prices crashed in 1986,
we stopped trying. With OPEC nations holding more than two thirds of the world’s
proven  oil  reserves  and  more  than  half  of  the  world’s  ultimate  conventional  oil  re-
sources, and with growing demand for oil for transportation in developed and devel-
oping economies, it was only a matter of time before they regained control of world
oil markets.

Potentially  effective  fuel  economy  policies  range  from  standards  to  market-based
measures.  Developed  economies  that  have  recently  tightened  their  fuel  economy  or
carbon  emission  standards  for  motor  vehicles  include  Japan,  the  entire  European
Union (EU) and Australia. China has also recently adopted fuel economy standards
with the aim of curbing their rapidly growing demand for oil (An and Sauer, 2004).
Each  country  has  a  different  form  of  standard,  and  each  one  is  different  from  our
own  Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  Standards.  Japan  and  China  have
mandatory standards that vary (in different ways) across vehicle weight classes. The
EU  and  Australia  negotiated  voluntary  standards  with  automobile  manufacturers

per vehicle kilometer.

CAFE OR UNIFORM PERCENTAGE INCREASES (UPI)

Our  CAFE  standards  were  effective  in  raising  passenger  car  and  light  truck  fuel
economy  and  curbing  the  growth  of  petroleum  demand.  They  have  been  criticized
on many grounds, but the one criticism that stands up to analysis is that they cre-
ated  a  more  severe  burden  for  the  ‘‘big  three’’  domestic  manufacturers  than  for
much  of  their  competition.  Differential  competitive  impacts  are  inherent  in  the
CAFE  system  whenever  manufacturers  specialize  in  different  market  segments  be-
cause it requires each manufacturer to meet the same MPG target, regardless of its
product mix. Manufacturers emphasizing larger light trucks and passenger cars will
clearly  have  a  more  difficult  task  than  those  concentrating  in  smaller  vehicle  mar-
ket  segments.  This  problem  was  ameliorated  but  not  eliminated  in  the  CAFE  law
by  defining  separate  targets  for  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks.  Another  provision
to  increase  flexibility  allows  manufacturers  to  average  their  fuel  economy  numbers
over a six year moving window (three years forward, three back). The economic effi-
ciency  of  the  CAFE  law  could  be  improved  further  by  allowing  manufacturers  to
trade fuel economy credits as recommended by the National Research Council (NRC,
2002)  CAFE  report.  Still,  these  trades  will  result  in  income  transfers  among  firms
unless credits are initially allocated to firms in a way that compensates in advance
for  such  transfers.  That  might  be  difficult  to  do  because  it  effectively  amounts  to
giving money to some firms and not others.

UPI  have  been  proposed  as  an  alternative  to  CAFE.  This  system  requires  each
manufacturer to achieve not the same MPG level, but the same percentage increase
in  MPG.  The  UPI  system  essentially  produces  a  mirror  image  of  the  differential
competitive  impacts  of  CAFE  (Greene  and  Hopson,  2004;  Plotkin  et  al.,  2002),  put-
ting  smaller  vehicle  manufacturers  and  manufacturers  that  have  already  adopted
advanced  fuel  economy  technologies  at  a  disadvantage.  A  UPI  system  would  also
discourage manufacturers from adopting more fuel economy technology than was ab-
solutely  required,  since  exceeding  the  standard  might  later  lead  to  having  to  meet
a  more  difficult  standard.  In  addition,  while  CAFE  can  discourage  manufacturers
from abandoning smaller vehicle production, UPI can discourage small vehicle man-
ufacturers from moving into larger vehicle markets.

ATTRIBUTE-BASED STANDARDS

Attribute-based  standards  set  fuel  economy  standards  based  on  measurable  vehi-
cle  attributes,  such  as  weight  or  size.  This  can  help  reduce,  but  probably  cannot
eliminate  (see,  e.g.,  Plotkin  et  al.,  2002,  Ch.  6),  the  competitive  impacts  of  CAFE
or  UPI  style  fuel  economy  standards.  Japan  has  had  successful  weight-class  fuel
economy standards for decades, and China has just adopted a weight-based system.
Weight-based  standards  take  account  of  the  product  mix  but  do  not  recognize  dif-
ferences in manufacturers’ current use of fuel economy technology. They do not rec-
ognize  the  possibility  that  different  manufacturers  may  be  serving  customers  with
different preferences for fuel economy. For these reasons, some degree of differential
competitive  impacts  will  occur  even  under  a  weight-based  system.  Finally,  weight-
based standards, depending on how there are designed, may or may not provide an
incentive for substituting advanced lightweight materials in vehicles as a way of in-
creasing fuel economy.

Size-based  standards  are  a  promising  but  largely  untested  alternative  to  weight-
based standards. Size-based standards could be based on dimensions such as wheel-
base  times  track  width,  or  interior  volume.  Such  standards  would  have  the  advan-
tage  of  preserving  the  option  of  reducing  vehicle  weight  to  increase  fuel  economy
without sacrificing vehicle size. There is some recent evidence to indicate that mod-
erate reductions in vehicle weight while maintaining basic vehicle dimensions would
be beneficial to highway safety (Van Auken and Zellner, 2004). Because there is no
experience  with  size-based  fuel  economy  standards,  the  engineering  and  design  im-
plications  of  such  standards  should  be  carefully  studied  before  they  are  formulated
and implemented.
VOLUNTARY STANDARDS

Voluntary  fuel  economy  standards  were  effective  in  Europe  in  the  1970s  and
1980s,  and  the  current  EU–ACEA  carbon  dioxide  emissions  standard  also  appears
to be headed for success in meeting its 2008 target. Canada also adopted voluntary
standards,  but  they  mirrored  the  U.S.  CAFE  standards  which  essentially  guaran-
teed  their  success.  According  to  economic  theory,  voluntary  standards  can  be  effec-
tive  if  there  is  a  credible  threat  of  mandatory  standards.  Voluntary  standards  can
take any of the forms of mandatory standards.

The EU–ACEA voluntary standards are worthy of note because they apply to the
entire industry, leaving the determination of individual firms’ responsibilities to ne-
gotiations among the firms. While this certainly has risks, it also creates the oppor-
tunity for firms to allocate responsibilities in an efficient and fair manner by setting
each  firm’s  target  at  the  same  level  of  marginal  cost  per  gallon  of  fuel  saved.  Be-
cause  compliance  is  achieved  voluntarily,  there  is  no  need  for  transfers  of  income
among  firms.  Thus,  economic  efficiency,  fairness  and  minimal  competitive  impacts
can all be achieved simultaneously. No other system can claim all three advantages.
FEEBATES

Feebates  are  an  entirely  market-based  approach.  Vehicles  above  a  chosen  ‘‘pivot’’
level of fuel consumption (best measured as the inverse of fuel economy, i.e., gallons
per  mile  or  liters  per  100  kilometers)  pay  a  fee,  while  those  below  receive  a  rebate
(Davis  et  al.,  1995).  The  most  efficient  approach  is  to  set  both  fees  and  rebates  at
a  fixed  rate  in  terms  of  dollars  per  0.01  gallons  per  mile  (or  equivalent).  This  pro-
vides  the  same  economic  incentive  to  save  a  gallon  of  gasoline  for  all  vehicles  (as-
suming equal miles of use).

The economic response to feebates is solely a function of the rate and not the pivot
points  because  the  rate  determines  the  marginal  value  of  increasing  fuel  efficiency.
The pivot points determine the transfer of revenues. This allows the creation of rev-
enue-neutral feebate systems that pay out as much as they take in. Feebate systems
can be designed with one pivot point or with vehicle class-specific pivot points. Anal-
ysis of feebate systems has shown that the transfer of revenues among manufactur-
ers  can  be  reduced  significantly  by  a  two  pivot  point  system  that  distinguishes  be-
tween  cars  and  light  trucks  (Greene  et  al.,  2005).  The  benefits  of  greater  numbers
of  pivot  points  is  unclear,  and  increasing  the  number  of  pivot  points  increases  the
opportunity  to  ‘‘game’’  the  system  by  moving  vehicles  from  one  class  to  another  to
attain a more easily achieved pivot point.

A  key  advantage  of  feebate  systems  is  that  they  provide  a  continuing  incentive
to  adopt  fuel  economy  technologies  as  long  as  they  remain  in  effect.  Whereas  once
a  CAFE  target  is  met  there  is  no  further  incentive  to  increase  fuel  economy,  the
feebate  rate  always  offers  an  additional  economic  incentive  to  avoid  a  dollar  of  fee
or  gain  a  dollar  of  rebate.  In  view  of  the  difficulty  of  raising  CAFE  standards  over
the  past  20  years,  this  could  be  an  extremely  valuable  feature  in  the  U.S.  political
context.

53

The  United  States  currently  has  in  place  half  of  a  feebate  system  on  half  of  the
vehicles,  in  the  form  of  the  gas  guzzler  tax.  The  rate  of  the  gas  guzzler  tax  is  very
high, and as a result, it has nearly eliminated gas guzzling passenger cars. Guzzler
taxes  or  rebates  alone  cannot  be  as  effective  as  a  comprehensive  feebate  system
(Greene  et  al.,  2005).  A  gas-guzzler  tax  on  passenger  cars  and  not  light  trucks  un-
doubtedly decreases the numbers of larger heavier passenger cars without similarly
affecting  light  trucks.  Given  the  current  CAFE  law,  the  gas-guzzler  tax  also  pro-
duces no benefit in terms of raising passenger car fuel economy.
GASOLINE TAXES

If the market for automotive fuel economy operated efficiently, increasing the tax
on  gasoline  would  be  the  most  economically  efficient  way  to  increase  fuel  economy.
Over  the  years,  higher  gasoline  taxes  have  proven  to  be  unpopular,  but  that  is  not
an  argument  against  their  desirability  from  an  economic  efficiency  standpoint.
There are, however, good reasons to believe that the market for fuel economy is not
efficient and, therefore, that standards have an important role to play.

First,  even  nations  with  gasoline  prices  two  to  three  times  higher  than  those  in
the  United  States  have  felt  it  necessary  to  have  fuel  economy  standards.  This  in-
cludes the entire EU and Japan. If the market for fuel economy were efficient, gaso-
line  prices  in  the  range  of  $3  to  $5  per  gallon  should  be  sufficient  to  raise  vehicle
fuel  economy.  Still,  the  EU  and  Japan  found  it  necessary  to  have  fuel  economy
standards.

Second,  the  net  value  to  consumers  of  technology-based  fuel  economy  improve-
ments appears to be small over a wide range of fuel economy levels. In general, ad-
vanced  fuel  economy  technology  costs  more  that  conventional  technology.  The  ben-
efit to consumers is therefore the present value of fuel saved minus the initial high-
er  cost  of  the  technology.  The  two  graphs  below  show  the  estimated  price  increase
and  value  of  fuel  savings  for  an  average  U.S.  passenger  car  as  fuel  economy  is  in-
creased  from  28  to  45  miles  per  gallon.  The  data  are  taken  from  the  2002  NRC
CAFE  study.  In  Figure  2,  the  customer  is  assumed  to  count  fuel  savings  over  the
full  life  of  the  vehicle,  yet  there  is  no  more  than  a  ±  $250  difference  in  net  value
(fuel  savings  minus  price  increase)  over  a  range  of  zero  percent  to  50  percent  in-
crease in fuel economy. Considering the uncertainty in what the customers’ true fuel
economy  number  will  be,  what  the  future  price  of  fuel  will  be,  and  what  the  con-
sumer  is  likely  to  actually  pay  for  higher  fuel  economy,  it  is  no  wonder  that  fuel
economy is not high on the consumers’ list of things to consider when buying a car.
From  the  manufacturers’  perspective,  however,  a  large  increase  in  fuel  economy  is
a long-term, high-cost, high-risk decision, requiring nearly complete vehicle redesign
and  substantial  retooling—all  for  something  customers  are  essentially  indifferent
about.

The  second  graph  (Figure  3)  displays  the  net  value  if  consumers  count  only  the
first three years of fuel savings. In this case, there is no economic incentive for con-
sumers to demand higher fuel economy or for manufacturers to supply it.

Third,  recent  evidence  from  surveys  indicates  that  consumers  are  indeed  under-
valuing  fuel  economy.  First,  survey  evidence,  generally  supported  by  automobile
manufacturers,  indicates  that  consumers  expect  an  expenditure  on  fuel  economy
technology  to  be  paid  back  in  fuel  savings  within  2–4  years,  far  less  than  the  full
lifetime  of  a  modern  automobile.  A  recent  study  by  the  University  of  California  at
Davis  (Turrentine  and  Kurani,  2005)  conducted  in-depth  interviews  with  60  house-
holds  in  California.  Few  even  considered  fuel  economy  in  their  purchase  decisions.
None  explicitly  calculated  the  potential  value  of  fuel  savings  by  any  method.  In
short, there was no evidence whatsoever of textbook, economically rational behavior
with respect to fuel economy.

Despite  the  apparent  imperfection  of  the  market  for  fuel  economy,  increasing  the
price  of  gasoline  would  be  a  sound  and  beneficial  policy.  It  would  signal  consumers
of  the  importance  of  reducing  fuel  use,  making  it  somewhat  easier  for  manufactur-
ers  to  sell  higher  fuel  economy  vehicles.  It  would  mitigate  and  could  eliminate  the
rebound  effect,  the  tendency  for  motorists  to  drive  a  little  more  when  higher  fuel
economy  reduces  the  fuel  cost  per  mile  of  travel.  Finally,  a  higher  tax  on  gasoline
would make up for revenues that would otherwise be lost to the highway trust fund
in the future when higher levels of fuel economy reduce the demand for motor fuel.

technologies  that  can  be  used  to  improve  fuel  economy  that  should  have  no  impact
on  vehicle  safety.  Technologies  such  as  variable  valve  timing  and  lift  control,  dis-
placement  on  demand,  reduced  aerodynamic  drag,  continuously  variable  trans-
missions, and engine friction reduction should be independent of vehicle safety. Sev-
eral  reports  have  developed  lists  of  such  technologies  and  estimate  their  likely  im-
pacts  on  vehicle  costs  and  fuel  economy.  The  2002  NRC  study  of  the  CAFE  stand-
ards  provides  an  extensive  analysis  of  how  such  technologies  could  be  used  to  cost-
effectively  increase  passenger  car  and  light  truck  fuel  economy.  Given  the  avail-
ability  of  such  technologies,  manufacturers  should  be  able  to  respond  to  the  de-
mands of a higher fuel economy standard without compromising safety.

The  argument  that  fuel  economy  improvement  inevitably  leads  to  weight  reduc-
tion  which  inevitably  leads  to  increased  fatalities  and  injuries  is  not  correct.  The
role  of  weight  reduction  versus  technology  in  achieving  the  fuel  economy  improve-
ments  of  the  past  thirty  years  has  been  greatly  exaggerated.  Weight  reduction  was
indeed  an  early  strategy  for  increasing  fuel  economy.  Vehicle  weight  reduction
began  before  the  CAFE  standards  went  into  effect,  probably  a  response  to  the  fuel
shortages  and  higher  prices  caused  by  the  first  oil  crisis  of  1973–74.  It  continued
after fuel economy standards went into effect in 1978 but ended in 1981. Fuel econ-
omy continued to improve through 1987 while weight increased. Since then, weight
has increased while the average fuel economy of new light-duty vehicles has gradu-
ally  declined,  in  large  part  due  to  the  increasing  market  share  of  light  trucks.  Ac-
cording  to  data  published  by  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  the  average
2004 model year light-duty vehicle actually weighed six pounds more than the aver-
age  light-duty  vehicle  sold  in  1975.  The  average  fuel  economy  of  a  new  light-duty
vehicle  sold  in  2004  was  58  percent  higher  than  in  1975  (Figure  4).  Clearly,  none
of  this  increase  can  be  attributed  to  weight  reduction  since  today’s  new  light-duty
vehicles are actually slightly heavier than their 1975 counterparts.

It  has  been  argued,  however,  that  further  increases  in  fuel  economy  standards
would  inevitably  lead  to  downsized  or  down-weighted  vehicles  and  that  smaller,
lighter vehicles are inherently less safe. By and large, this objection has focused on
weight  reduction  as  the  principal  threat  to  safety.  Reducing  vehicle  mass  is  cer-
tainly  one  way,  though  by  no  means  the  only  way  or  even  the  most  effective  way,
to  increase  fuel  economy.1 In  a  dissent  to  the  2002  NRC  CAFE  report,  Marianne
Keller  and  I  pointed  out  that  the  evidence  for  a  causal  link  from  fuel  economy  to
weight reduction to increase traffic fatalities and injuries was highly dubious. Since
that  report,  our  position  has  been  strengthened  by  four  scientific  studies.  With  the
support  of  Honda,  Van  Auken  and  Zellner  (2002)  attempted  to  replicate  Kahane’s
(1997)  path-breaking  analysis  of  the  relationship  between  vehicle  weight  and  crash
fatalities  using  more  recent  data  from  a  somewhat  different  subset  of  states.  They
found  that  a  reduction  in  the  weight  of  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks  of  100
pounds  would  not  increase  net  highway  fatalities.  In  an  extension  of  this  study  in
which  they  separately  estimated  the  impacts  of  weight  versus  size  (wheelbase  and
track width), Van Auken and Zellner (2003) found that reducing weight while hold-
ing  vehicle  size  constant  would  improve  safety  somewhat,  while  increasing  weight
at  constant  size  would  be  harmful  to  safety.  Kahane  (2003)  has  since  published  a
new  study  using  a  modified  methodology  that  contradicts  the  findings  of  the  first
Van  Auken  and  Zellner  study  and  concludes  that  weight  reduction  accompanied  by
size reduction would be harmful to safety, but Kahane’s new study still does not dis-
tinguish between the effects of size and weight.

1 In  general,  a  one  percent  reduction  in  vehicle  weight  at  constant  performance  can  produce

a 0.6 percent to 0.7 percent increase in fuel economy on the U.S. test cycle.

In  a  paper  forthcoming  in  Accident  Analysis  and  Prevention,  Wenzel  and  Ross
(2005)  demonstrate  two  key  points.  First,  they  show  that,  in  a  crash  between  vehi-
cles,  heavier  vehicles  may  provide  additional  protection  to  their  own  occupants  but
this  comes  at  the  expense  of  the  occupants  of  the  vehicles  with  which  they  collide.
This is important because it is consistent with the simple physics of elastic collisions
which imply that increasing the weight of one vehicle in a crash is a zero sum game:
the  heavier  vehicle  gains  safety  at  the  expense  of  the  lighter  vehicle.2 Wenzel  and
Ross  (2005)  also  show  that  light  trucks  with  chassis-on-frame  construction  tend  to
be  exceedingly  aggressive  in  collisions  with  other  vehicles  and  that  the  harm  they
do  to  other  vehicles  outweighs  the  benefit  of  their  additional  weight  to  their  occu-
pants.  These  vehicles  and  roll-over-prone  SUVs  turned  out,  on  net,  to  be  harmful
to overall traffic safety.3

Perhaps  the  seminal  study  linking  fuel  economy,  weight  and  safety  was  that  of
Crandall  and  Graham  (1989).  This  study,  however,  was  based  on  the  very  limited
experience with significant fuel economy changes that was available at the time the
analysis was carried out. It included data from 1947 to 1981, but the CAFE law was
not passed until 1975, took effect in the 1978 model year, and affected only new ve-
hicles and not the entire fleet. More recently, Noland (2004) examined the relation-
ship  between  fuel  economy,  fatalities  and  injuries  using  a  time  series  of  data  for
states  covering  the  period  1975  to  1998.  Instead  of  regressing  fatalities  or  injuries
against  vehicle  weight,  he  regressed  directly  against  fuel  economy.  This  is  signifi-
cant  because,  as  pointed  out  above,  weight  reduction  is  far  from  the  only  means  of
raising  vehicle  fuel  economy.  For  example,  reducing  engine  power  is  also  beneficial

2 These same simple laws of physics imply that a proportional down-weighting of both vehicles
would  have  no  effect  on  the  outcome  of  the  crash.  The  predictions  of  Kahane’s  1997  analysis
were also consistent with these simple laws, as Keller and I demonstrated in our dissent to the
NRC 2002 report.

3 The  fact  that  heavier  vehicles  benefit  their  occupants  in  a  collision  at  the  expense  of  occu-
pants  of  the  vehicles  with  which  they  collide  creates  what  economists  call  an  externality.  The
implication  is  that  individuals  will  buy  heavier  vehicles  than  they  would  if  they  considered  the
impacts on others.

to  fuel  economy.4 By  using  fuel  economy  instead  of  weight  as  an  independent  vari-
able,  Noland  was  able  to  reflect  all  the  possible  paths  by  which  fuel  economy  im-
provements  might  have  influenced  vehicle  design  and  thereby  safety.  What  Noland
found  was  that  the  relationship  between  fuel  economy  and  safety  was  not  stable
over time. It appeared that in the 1970s fuel economy was positively related to (in-
creased)  traffic  fatalities,  but  that  in  later  years  there  was  no  statistically  signifi-
cant  relationship.  Indeed,  Noland  found  that,  unless  the  years  1975  to  1977  were
included in the analysis, no statistically significant relationship could be found.

At  the  2005  Transportation  Research  Board  Meetings,  I  presented  the  results  of
a statistical analysis of the relationship between national average passenger car and
light truck fuel economy and total U.S. traffic fatalities for the period 1966 to 2002
(Ahmad  and  Greene,  2005)  (see  Figure  5).  Testing  a  wide  array  of  possible  models
and other contributing factors, our analysis demonstrated that the only statistically
significant  relationships  between  fuel  economy  and  traffic  fatalities  indicated  that
increasing  fuel  economy  was  associated  with  lower  traffic  fatalities,  not  higher.  For
a  number  of  reasons  we  cover  in  detail  in  the  paper,  we  do  not  conclude  that  in-
creasing fuel economy will reduce traffic fatalities. Rather we conclude that the ag-
gregate  national  traffic  fatality  and  fuel  economy  statistics  provide  no  support  for
the  hypothesis  that  increasing  fuel  economy  led  to  increased  traffic  fatalities  over
the  period  1966  to  2002.  While  these  results  contradict  the  earlier  findings  of
Crandall and Graham (1982), we believe this is because of the longer record of expe-
rience available to us today.

Major improvements in light-duty vehicle fuel economy will require major vehicle
design changes. Safety is always an issue when vehicle designs change. This strong-
ly argues for insuring that manufacturers have sufficient time to carry out redesigns
with  the  usual  level  of  care  and  attention  to  detail.  There  need  be  no  compromise
in  safety,  provided  that  fuel  economy  targets  are  set  at  levels  close  to  what  can  be
achieved with approximately cost-effective technologies.

3. CAN  THE  GOVERNMENT  ENCOURAGE  THE  ADOPTION  OF  TECH-
NOLOGIES TO IMPROVE FUEL ECONOMY WITHOUT GIVING ANY IN-
DIVIDUAL AUTOMAKER A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE?

4 A  one  percent  reduction  in  horsepower,  all  else  equal,  would  produce  a  0.2  percent  to  0.3

percent increase in fuel economy.

While  it  is  possible  for  the  government  to  encourage  the  adoption  of  technologies
to  improve  fuel  economy  without  giving  any  individual  automaker  a  significant  ad-
vantage,  most  of  the  policies  described  above  will  be  more  easily  complied  with  by
some manufacturers than others. However, there are ways to reduce competitive im-
pacts and improve the fairness of fuel economy policies.

What makes a system fair from a competitive perspective? This question could be
answered in many ways. I suggest the following definition. A fair policy is one that
(1)  requires  each  manufacturer  to  spend  the  same  amount  at  the  margin  to  reduce
the  fuel  consumption  of  each  car  by  one  gallon  per  mile  and  (2)  does  not  otherwise
redistribute revenues among manufacturers.5 A CAFE system with tradable credits
could  satisfy  the  first  criterion,  as  would  other  market-based  mechanisms  such  as
a feebate system or gasoline tax, but they could satisfy the second only with a com-
plex and probably controversial redistribution of revenue.6

In  my  opinion,  the  EU–ACEA  voluntary  fuel  economy  agreement  probably  comes
closest to meeting both criteria. It appears to me that manufacturers have allocated
the responsibility for meeting the industry target to individual firms in such a way
as  to  equalize  the  marginal  costs  per  liters/100  kilometers,  and  there  appear  to  be
no  inter-firm  transfer  payments.  However,  this  is  no  more  than  my  opinion  since
the firms have not disclosed the details of their agreement.

Four main factors give different firms different capabilities to increase fleet aver-

age fuel economy:

1. The technological capability of the firm
2. The firm’s current adoption of fuel economy technology in its products
3. The preferences of the customers served by the firm
4. The firm’s product mix

There  are  differences  in  the  ability  of  firms  to  use  specific  fuel  economy  tech-
nologies, but in general, technology is a fungible commodity in the automotive mar-
ket place. Firms can buy technology from suppliers and from other firms, generally,
but  not  always  at  competitive  prices.  Since  being  technically  capable  is  essential  to
being  able  to  compete  in  today’s  marketplace,  it  is  probably  best  not  to  attempt  to
address this issue in creating a fair fuel economy policy.

Some firms make greater use of technologies to increase fuel economy than others.
This  has  special  relevance  if  fuel  economy  metrics  such  as  the  uniform  percentage
increase  are  being  considered.  A  UPI  system  would  make  achieving  fuel  economy
goals  more  costly  for  those  firms  currently  making  the  greatest  use  of  technologies
to  increase  fuel  economy.  Their  marginal  costs  per  gallon  saved  would  therefore  be
higher  than  those  of  firms  using  less  fuel  economy  technology.  Firms  may  make
greater  use  of  fuel  economy  technologies  as  a  matter  of  corporate  policy  or  because
they  serve  a  segment  of  the  market  that  places  a  higher  value  on  fuel  economy.  In
the latter case, a CAFE system would disadvantage manufacturers who served con-
sumers less interested in fuel economy. There appears to be little publicly available
research on this subject.

Finally,  fuel  economy  policies  can  have  different  impacts  on  firms  that  specialize
in  large  or  small,  high  or  low  power  vehicles.  Although  there  has  been  substantial
convergence  over  time  in  the  product  offerings  of  major  manufacturers,  differences
still  remain.  Systems  like  CAFE,  UPI,  and  feebates  will  have  differential  impacts
on  manufacturers.  Setting  individual  targets  for  vehicle  types  (e.g.,  passenger  cars
vs.  trucks)  and  size  classes  can  mitigate  these  differential  impacts,  but  at  the  cost
of creating opportunities for ‘‘gaming’’ by shifting vehicles from one class to another
to  acquire  a  less  stringent  standard.  A  reasonable  but  not  perfect  balance  can  be
achieved  with  these  systems.  Steps  that  can  be  taken  to  minimize  differential  com-
petitive impacts are listed below.

1. Give adequate lead time

a. Time to first possible redesign
b. Time for orderly redesign and retooling

2. Allow for differences in the mix of vehicles sold

a. Vehicle classes

5 Assuming that every car travels the same number of miles, this would ensure that manufac-
turers  and  consumers  were  spending  the  same  marginal  cost  for  each  gallon  of  gasoline  saved.
6 There  is  also  good  reason  to  doubt  that  the  market  in  tradable  credits  would  be  an  open
and  competitive  one.  In  all  likelihood,  there  would  be  two  to  three  large  buyers  facing  two  to
three  large  sellers,  an  oligopsony  facing  an  oligopoly.  Rubin  et  al.,  however,  have  shown  that
even  in  this  situation  most  of  the  potential  efficiency  benefits  of  credit  trading  would  probably
be realized.

b. Attribute-based formulas

3. Build in flexibility

a. Carry-forward, carry-back windows
b. Credit trading with caps on credit prices
c. Administrative review

4. Insure  that  goals  are  feasible  with  approximately  cost-effective,  fungible

technologies

a. Technical analysis
b. Review other regulations for compatibility

As has been noted above, it is possible but not certain that a voluntary agreement
that allows manufacturers to allocate fuel economy improvement responsibilities can
achieve  equal  marginal  costs  of  compliance  and  no  revenue  transfers  among  firms.
With a feebate system or tradable credit CAFE system, it is also possible to allocate
initial  credits  in  such  a  way  as  to  mitigate  the  differential  financial  impacts  that
would otherwise occur. Such allocations are likely to be controversial, however, since
they will amount to substantial payments to some firms and not others.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  And  thank  all  of

you for your outstanding testimony.

right?

Let  us  address  something  right  off  the  bat  that  I  think  is  very
important. We have all been through this drill before. We know the
arguments  pro  and  con.  I  am  going  to  make  a  statement  and  ask
each of the witnesses if they agree or disagree with this statement.
And  the  statement  is  this:  the  only  way  to  increase  CAFE  stand-
ards  is  to  make  vehicles  lighter  and  therefore  less  safe.  Do  you
agree or disagree with that statement?

Mr. Reilly.
Mr.  REILLY.  You  mean  the  only  way  to  improve  fuel  economy,

Chairman BOEHLERT. Exactly.
Mr. REILLY. Right. No, I disagree with that.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Dr. Duleep.
Mr. DULEEP. I disagree.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Stanton.
Mr.  STANTON.  I  am  confused.  Could  you  tell  me  one  more  time?
Chairman BOEHLERT. All right. The only way to increase fuel ef-
ficiency,  using  increased  CAFE  standards,  is  to  make  vehicles
lighter and therefore less safe.

Mr. STANTON. Disagree.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you.
Dr. Greene.
Dr. GREENE. Disagree.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
All  right.  Mr.  Portney  and—Dr.  Portney  and  Mr.  Duleep,  you
both  state  the  percentages  by  which  fuel  economy  could  safely  be
improved by deploying a number of technologies ranging from more
efficient  transmissions  to  diesel  and  hybrid  engines,  and  inciden-
tally,  try  to  buy  a  hybrid  today,  and  they  will  tell  you  to  stand  in
line. But presumably, those are percentages by which an individual
model,  or  even  a  class  of  vehicles,  could  be  improved.  Tell  me  how
those  figures  would  translate  into  fleet-wide  averages.  By  how
much  would  it  be  possible  for  Congress,  should  it  choose  to  do  so,
raise the CAFE standards, and in what time frame?

Dr. Portney.
Mr. PORTNEY. I will let Mr. Duleep go first.
Mr.  DULEEP.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  key  assumption  would  be  what
happens  with  the  consumer  demand.  In  other  words,  are  con-
sumers buying the same kinds of cars today and in 2015 and how—
what  would  you  assume  on  that?  And  if  you  make  the  assumption
that  people  buy  the  same  mix  of  vehicles  and  the  same  kind  of
horsepower  and  the  same  features,  then  I  believe  that,  just  with
conventional  technology  on  cars,  you  can  get  up  to  about  32  or  33
miles  per  gallon  with  just  conventional,  no  hybrids  or  diesels,  and
for  the  light  trucks,  you  would  get  up  in  the  neighborhood  of  23c
or 24 miles per gallon.

Unfortunately,  as  I  mentioned,  that  is—people  are  buying  more
and  more  attributes.  That  is  they  want  four-wheel-drive,  and  they
want cars that ride high and more cup holders and a bigger stereo
and  so  on.  And  so  that  is  going  to  take  away  from  these  numbers.
And  clearly,  I  would  expect  that  about  half  of  the  improvement
would go away, and perhaps even more. It might go away and con-
sumers  are  just  buying  more  vehicle.  If  you  add  in,  say,  the  diesel
and  hybrid,  with  reasonable  market  penetrations,  like  the  kinds
that  Dr.  Greene  computed,  which  is  about  20  percent  of  the  mar-
ket, then they can do another two or three miles per gallon.

So some number in the neighborhood of 35 or 36 miles per gallon
for  cars  and  some  number  like  26  or  27  miles  per  gallon  may  be
possible. But again, the backsliding issue is, like, a major one.

Chairman BOEHLERT. In using existing technology?
Mr. DULEEP. No, sir; the—this would use hybrid and diesel, per-

haps diesels for the trucks and——

Chairman BOEHLERT. That is existing technology, right?
Mr. DULEEP. That is all—yeah.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Dr. Portney.
Mr.  PORTNEY.  Well,  I  am  going  to  espouse  an  unpopular  view.  I
think several of my colleagues on the panel have disagreed with it,
and  I  realize  it  is  a  particularly  difficult  view  for  those  of  you  in
Congress.  But  I  want  to  say  that  there  is  a  problem  with  using
CAFE  standards  as  a  way  to  improve  fuel  economy  in  contrast  to
increasing, say, the federal excise tax on gasoline. And it is impor-
tant  for  everybody  to  understand  this  distinction.  If  I  have  a  car
that gets 50 miles per gallon, but I drive that car 50,000 miles per

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

63

year,  I  use  more  gasoline  than  if  I  have  a  car  that  gets  10,000—
or 10 miles per gallon that I only drive 5,000 miles per year.

So it is not just the fuel economy of the car, it is also the number
of vehicle miles traveled that the—that determine how much gaso-
line  we  use,  and  therefore  how  much  we  are  contributing  to  the
greenhouse  gas  burden  in  the  atmosphere  or  how  insecure  our  en-
ergy supply is becoming. And so, while no one likes to vote for tax
increases,  I  mean,  you  need  to  keep  in  mind  that  just  requiring
that cars be more fuel-efficient only gets at part of this. And when
cars  become  more  fuel  efficient,  it  becomes  cheaper  to  drive  each
mile,  so  you  lose  a  little  bit,  because  people  cheat  and  drive  more
miles, because they have more fuel-efficient cars.

Now I notice you shaking your head——
Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, no, that would be the subject of con-
siderable  debate,  and  I—you  know,  a  good,  healthy,  honest
debate——

Mr. PORTNEY. Well, and——
Chairman  BOEHLERT.—because,  you  know,  I  think  most  people
just  don’t  go  out,  like  we  used  to  when  I  was  a  kid,  for  a  Sunday
drive.  People  drive  from  their  home  to  their  place  of  work,  or  if
they  have  a  limited  time  off  home  to  recreate  someplace,  I  don’t
think  people  just  go  out  and  drive  a  lot  depending  upon  the  price
of gasoline.

So we—I mean, the desire is to make the automobiles more fuel-
efficient. That is to the advantage of consumers. That is in our na-
tional security interests.

And  let  me  go  to  Mr.  Stanton.  You  know,  I  watched  the  Super
Bowl,  and  I  must  confess,  a  lot  of  people  did.  I  will  tell  you,  when
you  talk  about  consumer  demand,  I  would  say  I  have  to  commend
your  industry,  one  member  of  it,  that  ad  that  Ford  put  on  for  the
new  Mustang  was  one  of  the  stars  of  the  whole  commercials.  And
I think a lot of people watch the Super Bowl just to watch the com-
mercials,  and  they  don’t  give  a  darn  about  the  Patriots  or  the  Ea-
gles.  But  it  seems  to  me  that  the  industry,  if—you  can  help  drive
consumer  demand  by  your  marketing  and  advertising  approach.
And I don’t know if there are any examples of members of your Al-
liance  selling  safety  or  selling  fuel  efficiency.  But  I  will  tell  you
this, I have been around this town long enough to remember when
a  hot  shot  young  vice  president  from  Ford  came  to  town  and  told
the Congress, and I was on the staff at that time, ‘‘If you mandate
seat  belts,  that  will  have  a  devastating  negative  impact  on  the  in-
dustry I represent.’’ Fast forward several years, that guy then was
chairman  of  the  board  of  another  automobile  company  and  was  on
saying, you know, ‘‘Buy our product. We have got airbags to protect
you,  and  no  one  requires  it,  but  we  are  concerned  for  your  safety.’’
So I would suggest that a lot of this has to do with your marketing
approach.

And we all have to be sensitive to your industry. It is a very vital
part  of  our  overall  economy.  And  for  us  to  put  undue  burdens  on
the auto industry is counterproductive. But I think to impose some
reasonable  burdens  and  work  cooperatively  with  you,  not  say  we
need  something  by  8:30  tonight,  but  you  know,  with  a  lead  time
frame,  as  Mr.  Reilly  has  testified,  as  Dr.  Portney  has  emphasized

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

in  the  report,  I  think  is  a  reasonable  approach.  I  could—I  am  on
my high horse, and I have got the advantage of the microphone——

Mr. STANTON. Could I have it for a minute?
Chairman BOEHLERT. Sure, by all means, Mr. Stanton. Yeah.
Mr.  STANTON.  For  someone  who  spent  5c  lobbying  the  States  for
mandatory  safety  belt  use  laws,  our  industry  has  changed  a  lot.
There  is  just  absolutely  no  question  about  it.  I  can’t  tell  you  how
proud  I  am  to  say  that  we  have  got  national  safety  belt  usage  up
to  85  percent.  We  have  got  a  long  ways  to  go  still,  but  at  least  we
are making progress.

I  was  also  very  pleased  to  watch  the  Super  Bowl,  and  I  noticed
that  three  of  our  members  had  three  drastically  different  commer-
cials.  One  of  the  members  had,  in  addition  to  Ford,  a  commercial
on  power  and  acceleration.  And  then  another,  which  you  probably
really  recognize,  had  a  commercial  about  the  Prius.  So  we  had
three very different target audiences, and that is I think the—what
I  heard  in  all  of  the  testimony  today  is  how  complex  an  issue  it  is
to  get  what  we  all  want,  and  I  really  want  to  emphasize  this.  We
all  want  to  reduce  our  dependence  on  foreign  oil.  The  only  dif-
ference of opinion, I think, is how to go about doing it.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
With that, Mr. Gordon.
Mr.  GORDON.  Mr.  Reilly,  you  said  that  your  Commission  rec-
ommended  that  there  be  significantly  higher  CAFE  standards,  but
you also said that you I guess intentionally did not try to say what
those  standards  would  be.  You  know,  having  worked  with  this
group  and  what  you  know,  what  would  you  say  would  be  the  min-
imum of a higher standard?

You need to—you——
Mr.  REILLY.  I  don’t  want  to  go  beyond  where  the  Commission

itself has come out. This was one of the——

Mr.  GORDON.  Well,  that  is  why  I  was  asking  you,  as  an  indi-
vidual  who  has  assimilated  all  of  this  information.  What  would  be
the minimum?

Mr.  REILLY.  Well,  let  me  just  say  that  this  was  a  particularly
contentious  and  concerning  issue  that  our  Commission  addressed.
We looked at a lot of options. We looked at their advantages, their
costs.  We  did  propose  these  consumer  incentives  as  well  as  manu-
facturer incentives to encourage more fuel efficient, advanced diesel
and  hybrids.  The  consultant  studies  on  which  we  relied  strongly
suggested that a 10- to 20-mile-per-gallon increase in CAFE would
be  cost  effective  and  a  desirable  policy.  When  I  say  ‘‘significant,’’
when  the  Commission  said  a  ‘‘significant  increase,’’  I  think  it  is
reasonable to infer from those studies and from the language of our
report  that  that  is  the  range  that  most  of  us  were  contemplating.
Mr. GORDON. So when you say ‘‘range,’’ would 10 be a minimum

then?

Mr. REILLY. Ten would be a number that I believe most——
Mr. GORDON. That most folks would——
Mr. REILLY.—members of the Commission would endorse.
Mr. GORDON. Okay. And Mr. Stanton, what is your opinion as to
how  long  it  would  take  the  automobile  industry  and  how  feasible
is it to obtain a 10 percent—or a 10-mile CAFE increase?

Mr. STANTON. A lot of it would depend upon market forces, obvi-
ously.  I  think  that  we  have  just  seen  the  biggest  increase  in  light
truck fuel efficiency standards, which was between 2005 and 2007.
And  that  was  a  7c  percent  increase.  That  was  supposedly  deter-
mined  by  NHTSA  with  the  congressional  criteria  of  looking  at  all
of  the  factors  that  are  important,  including  employment  and  pro-
duction cycles, et cetera.

One of the problems that we have with looking forward to what-
ever  the  time  frame  is  that  a  substantial  time  frame  builds  uncer-
tainty  into  the  standard—into  the  process  for  us.  We  don’t  know
where  consumers  are  going  to  be.  We  don’t  know  where  the  de-
mands  are  going  to  be.  We  are—we  do  not,  and  would  not,  rec-
ommend  that  we  set  standards  separate  from  where—or  different
from  where  our  customer  base  is.  And  this  goes  back  to  the  com-
ments  that  were  made  here,  too.  We  need  to  get  the  consumer
somehow in the equation, because right now, just as we were talk-
ing  about  with  the  Super  Bowl  ads,  we  have  got  customers  out
there that want power. And if we want to sell vehicles, we will sell
power. And that—you see that in the marketplace. But we are also
doing an awful lot on the advanced technology side of it in an effort
to  maintain  those  attributes  that  our  customers  want  and,  at  the
same time, get a major increase in fuel efficiency.

Mr. GORDON. But I am talking more of the technology. You know,
I mean—you know, in terms of you have to have a reasonable time
to come out with new models and so to get a 10-mile increase, what
kind  of  lead  time—again,  is  that  possible,  and  if  so,  what  kind  of
lead time is necessary to keep it in that—and I guess the question
is  what  is  a  reasonable,  you  know,  increase.  So  what  kind  of—are
we talking five years, 20 years?

Mr. STANTON. The dilemma that I face is I just really don’t know
the  answer  if  that  is  the  right  number  in  a  given  period  of  time.
If we could make some certain assumptions that, you know, 50 per-
cent  of  the  vehicles  would  be  hybrids  or  gas  prices  would  be  some
place  else,  then  we  could  chart  a  path  that  would  make  sense  to
get there. But I don’t know how to answer those questions.

Mr. GORDON. Well, let me ask you this. Is the Alliance—have you

taken a position on tradable CAFE compliance credit programs?

Mr.  STANTON.  Actually,  we  like  the  idea  of  increased  flexibility
in the program. And in preparation for the hearing, we tried to fig-
ure  out  what  exactly  was  meant  by  the  tradable  credits  program
that  had  been  espoused  by  a  number  of  my  colleagues  here.  And
we  found  out  that  we  didn’t  fully  understand  all  of  the  ramifica-
tions  of  it,  but  it  is  something  we  certainly  would  be  willing  to  do.
Mr.  GORDON.  What  do  you  think  it  will  take  to  help  you  to  un-

derstand that better?

Mr. STANTON. Some pretty healthy discussions, I think.
Mr. GORDON. Is there a forum for that?
Mr. STANTON. No, sir.
Mr.  GORDON.  And  does  anyone  here  have  a  suggestion  on  what
would  be  a  necessary  forum?  And  also,  I  think  in  that  discussion,
the  statistic  that  you  pointed  out  that  was  a  17  percent  reduction
in  the  costs  by  having  this,  what  would  be  an  appropriate  forum
for that discussion? Anyone? Go right ahead.

Mr. PORTNEY. I would be happy to convene a group of auto mak-
ers  and  analysts  who  have  floated  this  idea  of  tradable  credits  at
Resources  for  the  Future  any  time  to  have  a  talk  about  this  and
try  to  explain  the  idea  in  more  detail  so  that  even  the  analysts
could  better  understand  what  the  pros  and  cons  are.  I  would  be
happy to do that.

Mr.  GORDON.  I  think  that  would  be  helpful  for  us  if  there  could
be  some  groundwork  laid  on  something  like  that.  I  mean,  hope-
fully—that  might  be  very  well  an  area  of  consensus  within  the—
between  the  industry  and  those  folks  that  are,  you  know,  want  an
increase in the fuel efficiency.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Ms. Biggert.
Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The  National  Highway  and  Traffic  Safety  Administration  is  con-
sidering  ways  to  reform  the  CAFE  system,  and  one  of  the—one
method  is  the  weight-based  standard.  In  my  District,  we  have  a
company that is just newly developing a process—a reactor in proc-
ess  to  produce  titanium.  It  is  called  International  Titanium  Pow-
der, in a very useful forum, and they are actually working with the
military  now  and  looking  at  the  weight  of  tanks  and  the  weight  of
Humvees. Is NHTSA considering advances in materials, like I have
just  described  with  respect  to  titanium  as  it  contemplates  reform
to the CAFE program? Mr. Stanton? Or is this something that you
would see in—rather than just looking at the CAFE standards and
the  weight  to  look  at  advanced  materials  in  deciding  how  to  raise
those standards? Dr. Greene.

Dr.  GREENE.  One  thing  about  weight-based  standard  can  be  for-
mulated in any number of ways. It can be formulated to encourage
weight  increasing  in  cars.  It  can  be  formulated  to  discourage  it.
And so if it were formulated to discourage increasing the weight of
cars,  that  would  encourage  material  substitution  of  the  kind  you
are describing. I think this gets at the real issue in auto safety and
weight,  which  is  the  energy  that  has  to  be  absorbed  in  a  crash  in
order to minimize the maximum deceleration that is experienced by
the  people  in  the  car,  and  the  ability  of  the  materials  to  handle
that. The heavier the car, the more energy has to be absorbed, and
so  there  is  a  trade-off  there.  But  advanced  materials  ought  to  be
able to play a role in making safer and lighter cars.

Ms. BIGGERT. Because if this material is lighter and yet it is just
as  strong,  it  is—it  would  reduce  the  fuel  consumption.  And  you
talked  about  the  cars’  size  versus  weight  and  said  that  there  can
be lighter cars, which are just as safe, depending on the size.

Dr.  GREENE.  Yeah,  on—the  study  done  by—sponsored  by  Honda
essentially  took  the  same  approach  as  the  National  Highway  Traf-
fic  Safety  Administration  and  Dr.  Kahain  did  in  his  study,  but
tried  to  separate  the  effect  of  size  from  the  effect  of  weight,  which
Dr. Kahain did not try to do, and came to the conclusion that mak-
ing cars the same size but a bit lighter would be beneficial to safe-
ty.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you.
Mr. Stanton.

67

Mr.  STANTON.  Yeah.  Just  to  follow  up  on  one—well,  two  points,
actually.  One  is  that,  by  all  means,  we  are  always  into  advanced
technologies,  and  if  you  have  someone  in  your  District,  then  we
would love to talk to them if they have got a promising technology,
and by all means, we can make that happen.

The  second  point  is  on  the  size  and  mass.  We  are  still  learning
an awful lot on safety. But basically, it is our opinion anyway, that
at  the  present  time  that  it  is  a  function  of  both  mass  and  volume
or  size.  We  have  got  to  remember  that  we  are  talking  about  a
whole fleet out there. And the question—the public policy question
we are trying to struggle with is how do we increase the safety for
all of the driving public? We can’t sacrifice some safety for someone
to  improve  safety  for  someone  else.  We  can  do  that,  but  we  don’t
think that is the right public policy.

Ms.  BIGGERT.  With  regard  to  NHTSA,  the  regulatory  process,
and they have had the process for raising CAFE standards for light
trucks, and it seems to have been working. It was going up. It went
unimpeded  by  Congress.  Is—do  you  agree  that—well,  particularly
Mr. Stanton, do you agree that this would continue if we hadn’t put
a hold on the raising of those standards?

Mr.  STANTON.  Not  only  would  I  agree,  it  would  have  to,  under
the law that Congress has passed, that NHTSA has to set the max-
imum  feasible  standard  for  light  trucks  for  each  and  every  year.  I
think you are absolutely correct. And we anticipate that it will con-
tinue.

Ms. BIGGERT. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Lipinski.
Mr. LIPINSKI. Thank you.
A  number  of  you  had  touched  upon  this,  but  I  don’t  know  if  you
really  wanted—it  is  a  little  bit  off  of  the  question  exactly  of  tech-
nology,  but  I  want  to  see  if  anyone  wanted  to  just  take  a  stab  at
this. What do we really know about consumers’ habits in regard to
purchasing  vehicles,  their  driving  habits?  I  have  heard,  you  know,
different  things,  suggestions  about  what  may—what  changes  may
occur in the vehicles purchased or, you know, how they drive. They
get  better  mileage,  are  they  going  to  drive  differently?  Or  perhaps
even, you know, if they got feedback on what their mileage is that
they  are  getting,  do  people  actually  respond  to  that.  And  so  what
do  we  know?  You  know,  if  we  are  working  at  this,  you  know,
through  a  free  market,  what  can  we  do  in  that  regard?  Go  ahead.
Dr. GREENE. Given the importance of this subject of fuel economy
and  car  purchases,  there  has  been  remarkably  little  research  on
this  subject.  There  has  been,  however,  recently  completed  by  the
University  of  California  Davis,  in-depth  interviews  of  households,
their  complete  history  of  automobile  purchase  decisions,  and  get-
ting  at  where  fuel  economy  came  into  those  decisions,  and  when
they  did  consider  it,  how  did  they  go  about  doing  it.  And  what
those researchers found is that a small minority of the people con-
sidered  fuel  economy  at  all  in  making  their  car-buying  decisions.
And  of  those  who  did,  none  of  them  made  any  explicit  calculations
about what the value the fuel saving would be worth and what the
car would cost. And nobody thought in terms of paying more to get
a  more  fuel-efficient  car.  They  thought  in  terms  of  paying  less  to
get a smaller, lighter, less-efficient car. So this idea of adding tech-

nology to improve efficiency is not in the consumer’s mind when he
goes to buy the car. That is something that happens on the manu-
facturer’s side in designing the vehicle.

Now  a  great  deal  is  known  about  travel  behavior,  and  we  have
entire  Transportation  Research  Board  meetings  every  January  in
which  there  are  thousands  of  papers  presented,  half  of  them  or  so
on subjects related to that. But is it well understood? Well, I think
most  of  them  would  say  no,  it  is  not.  There  are  still,  sort  of,  some
mysteries there.

But  one  of  the  things  that  has  been  studied  fairly  carefully  is
this rebound effect. And we know that if you look back historically,
the  rebound  effect  is  probably  somewhere  in  the  range  of  10  to  20
percent, meaning if you improve the fuel economy of the vehicle by
50  percent,  then  people  will  drive,  maybe,  five  to  10  percent  more
in  the  long  run.  And  we—I  suspect  that  the  rebound  effect  de-
creases over time, as the cost of fuel becomes less and less and less
important  in  the  monetary  costs  of  operating  a  vehicle  and  includ-
ing, also, the value of a person’s time.

So I think the rebound effect is a small effect, but it is real, and
it  is  probably  decreasing  over  time,  as  people’s  time  becomes  more
valuable. This was confirmed by a recent study from the University
of California, again out of Irvine, Professor Kent Small.

Mr. STANTON. Briefly that—and I was looking in my briefcase to
see  if  we—if  I  had  brought  it  with  me,  but  there  are  a  number  of
polls that are out there on what consumers value when they search
for  a  new  vehicle.  Usually  the  first  item  is  reliability  and  then  it
goes  down  to  cost  and  other  attributes.  I  think  verifying  what  the
panel  is  saying  here  is  in  the  past,  fuel  efficiency  wasn’t  even  on
the  list,  and  it  is  there  now  as  number  13  on  the  2004  poll  that
I had seen.

Mr. LIPINSKI. And does this mean that, in essence, have to forget
about  the  consumer  side  when  we  are,  you  know,  trying  to,  you
know, save fuel? Does it all have to then come from, you know, the
manufacturer  side  and,  you  know,  are  they  going  to  the  people?  If
consumers  don’t  care  about  it,  then,  you  know,  what  incentive  do
they  have  to  be—you  know,  make  more  fuel-efficient  vehicles,  and
does  that  come  down  to  incentives  that  the  government  may  have
to give them to be more fuel efficient, such as the CAFE standards
and that is the only thing that is going to move them?

Mr. REILLY. Well, sir, the National Commission on Energy Policy
considered  that  incentives  are  necessary,  incentives  both  to  the
manufacturers and the parts suppliers to them and also incentives
to the consumers themselves. There is currently a tax deduction of
up  to  $2,000.  It  is  worth  between  $400  and  $600  to  the  average
taxpayer, and that is provided to consumers who purchase new hy-
brid  electric  vehicles.  That  starts  phasing  out—expires  after  2006.
The  Commission  supports  extending  that  tax  incentive  for  five
years, 2007 to 2011, but altering the mechanism from a simple de-
duction  to  a  variable  credit  of  up  to  $3,000  based  on  vehicle  fuel
economy, and also expanding the scope of the allowance of the pro-
gram  to  include  advanced  diesel  vehicles,  from  which  we  expect
quite a lot of fuel efficiency in the years to come.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you.  The  gentleman’s  time  is  ex-

pired.

Mr. Sodrel.
Mr. SODREL. I think you have answered a lot of my questions as
I sit here. I am a free market person. I mean, I believe in the mar-
ketplace.  I  believe  it  produces  products  that  consumers  want.  And
my  question  really  went  to  what  marketing—and  maybe  it  is  best
for  Mr.  Stanton.  What  marketing—we  talked  a  little  bit  about  the
Super  Bowl  and  the  convertible  with  the  frozen  guy  sitting  at  the
wheel.  What  kind  of  marketing  programs  have  the  automobile
manufacturers  undertaken  to  try  to  sell  fuel  economy  to  their  cus-
tomers and to the marketplace?

Mr. STANTON. Well, I think that the best, and probably the most
efficient  program,  as  you  look  at  the  most  fuel-efficient  vehicles,
and  they  are  also  the  least  expensive,  so  I  mean,  it  is—other  than
pricing,  and  I  think  it  is  pretty  well  known  that  on  a  lot  of  the
smaller  vehicles,  the  manufacturers  are  pretty  much  giving  them
away.  It  is  very  difficult  to  make—to  compete  successfully  in  that
marketplace.

Mr. SODREL. Yes, sir.
Mr. PORTNEY. If I can weigh in on this, first of all, I am glad we
are  staying  away  from  BigDaddy.com  commercials  here.  I—on
this—the  issue  of  the  free  market  in  all  of  this,  I  absolutely  agree
with  you:  we  all  benefit  from  a  free  market  that  produces  shoes
and  pencils  and  everything  else,  and  I  think  it  is  for—goods  and
services  for  which  all  of  the  costs  are  borne  by  the  producers  and
the  consumers,  it  is,  by  far,  the  best  way  to  organize  an  economic
system.  The  one  justification  you  can  make  for  having  the  govern-
ment  involved  in  this  particular  case,  either  through  higher  taxes
or  through  mandated  fuel  economy  standards,  is  that  when  I  go
buy a car, typically I count in the cost of that thing how much the
purchase  price  of  the  car  is  and  what  it  will  cost  me  over  my  life-
time. Typically, people don’t take into account the fact that the gas-
oline  that  they  use  is  contributing  to  the  atmospheric  burden  of
carbon dioxide. They don’t take into account, in their own purchase
decisions,  this  dependence  on  imported  oil,  and  that  is  why,  in  a
case  where  you  wouldn’t  get  involved  if  there  weren’t  these  exter-
nal  costs,  that  there  is  a  good  reason  for  economic  efficiency  that
you  can  justify  some  form  of  government  involvement  in  the  fuel
economy—in  the  case  of  fuel  economy.  We  can  certainly  argue
about  what  is  the  best  way  to  do  it,  but  I  think  there  is  a  case
there that, because there is a form of market failure, that you need
some kind of government intervention.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Miller.
Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Just  a  couple  questions.  Mr.  Stanton,  you  mentioned  that  your
association  supports  the  President’s  hydrogen  fuel  cell  proposal.
This committee had hearings in the last Congress on that proposal,
and there seemed to be a great deal of skepticism that there is not
an ample supply of hydrogen out there, we just need to find a way
to  use  it,  that,  in  fact,  the  hydrogen  has  to  come  from  other  fossil
fuels, has to be stripped out, that it is not a particularly clean proc-
ess to do that. It doesn’t really free us from our dependency on for-
eign—on fossil fuels. We seem to be pursuing that to the exclusion
of  other  alternative  fuels,  and  we  have  some  massive  amount  of
money tied up in a liquid fuel in transporting liquid fuels and hav-

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

70

ing  it  available.  My  question  to  you  is  have  things  changed  in  the
last couple of years on that proposal? Do we—where would the hy-
drogen  come  from  if  we  really  dramatically  changed  from  a  fossil
to a hydrogen economy?

Mr.  STANTON.  Well,  I  think  we  all  believe  that  somewhere  down
the line it has got to come from renewables if we are going to work
our  way  out  of  this.  It  is  really  the  goal,  I  think,  that  we  would
like  to  see,  and  we  recognize  that.  And  I  hope  everybody  under-
stands  that.  As  the  industry,  we  agree  that  dependence  on  foreign
oil  is  a  national  issue.  And  the  question  is  what  is  the  best  path
out  of  that.  And  we  are  struggling  with  exactly  what  is  the  best
path.  Certainly  research—additional  research  and  development,
the  things  that  this  committee  has  done  in  the  past  or  things  that
we have supported, part of our members are involved in FutureCar
and FreedomCAR. I personally was involved in the PNGV program.
Those kinds of programs are the kind of research and development
that we are going to need to solve this conundrum that we find our-
selves in.

Mr.  MILLER.  Mr.  Portney,  you  seemed  to  be  nodding  your  head
to  that  question,  so  did  you  have  anything  you  wanted  to  add
or——

Mr. PORTNEY. Just that, you know, I think everyone is optimistic
about  anything  that  has  the  potential  technological  promise  of  hy-
drogen  of  being  a  completely  clean  energy  source,  but  I  think  we
need  to  do  something  sooner  than  the  time  frame  in  which  hydro-
gen  will  become  the  major  propulsion  for  motor  vehicles.  I  mean,
I  think  that  is  really  15  or  20  years  off.  I  would  love  to  be  more
optimistic  than  that.  I  think  we  can’t  wait  15  or  20  years  before
we  try  to  do  something,  regardless  of  what  it  might  be,  to  try  to
improve the fuel economy of the overall fleet, whether it is through
higher  taxes  or  technological  fuel  economy  requirements  or  what-
ever. I would hate to just put all of our eggs in the hydrogen basket
and  not  do  anything  for  20  years  in  the  hopes  that  that  will  be
available and to solve the problem.

Mr.  MILLER.  Mr.  Stanton,  you  seemed  to  describe  a  two-step
process: figure out, one, how to make hydrogen work, then, two, fig-
ure  out  where  we  are  going  to  get  the  hydrogen.  How  long—Mr.
Portney—Dr.  Portney  suggested  that  that  would  be  a  15-  or  20-
year  proposal.  Do  you  see  it  as  being  substantially  more  than  that
or less than that?

Mr.  STANTON.  Yeah,  actually,  we  have  some  members  that  are
very  high  on  bringing  fuel  cell  vehicles  to  the  fleet  now,  but  the
question is what are the numbers and what is the impact going to
be.  And  we  certainly  agree  with  Paul  that  we  need  something  in
between,  and  that  is  why  we  are  supporting  and  working  hard  on
the hybrid vehicles and the clean diesel, because that is the interim
path that we see to getting us to the hydrogen——

Mr.  MILLER.  One  of  the  criticisms  in  the  hearings  that  we  held
in  the  last  Congress  was  that  the  proposal—President’s  proposal,
I believe it was $3 billion, was to the exclusion of other alliterative
fuels. But from what you have just described, we obviously need to
be  doing  both.  Do  you  think  we  are  doing  enough  to  develop  other
alternative  fuels  from  which  we  would  get  hydrogen,  as  well  as
having those alternative fuels to use in the meantime?

Mr. STANTON. Mr. Miller, you are beyond my expertise on all——
Mr. MILLER. Okay.
Mr.  STANTON.  I  think  we,  generally,  as  an  industry,  are  looking
at all of the paths, and we are just trying to find what is the right
one and work with the right people to get there.

Mr. MILLER. Okay. Dr. Portney, I think I saw you nodding again.

Did you have anything to——

Mr. PORTNEY. I am going to hold my head——
Mr. MILLER. You may just have a tick, I don’t know.
Mr.  PORTNEY.—very  still  in  the  future  here.  I—let  me  just  say,
I am always worried when the government or the private sector or
anybody  puts  all  of  its  eggs  in  one  basket.  And  I  think  what  we
ought  to  do  is  have  a  goal  for  a  fuel  economy  for  the  fleet  without
specifying  the  technology,  whether  it  is  diesel  or  hybrid  or  hydro-
gen  or  improved  internal  combustion  engines.  I  always  worry
where  we  sort  of  anoint  a  winner  and  put  all  of  our  R&D  dollars
and other efforts into that.

Mr. MILLER. So Mr. Reilly, you did more than nod.
Mr. REILLY. If I might add to that, thank you.
Our  Commission,  in  that  opening  statement  I  gave  about  the
crunch that is coming in liquid fuels need versus production capac-
ity  over  the  coming  years  and  the  current  shortfall,  a  very  limited
capacity  that  exists  of  less  than  two  percent  of  excess  capacity,  we
looked  at  the  need  for  a  whole  range  of  new  interventions  and  of
new  efficiencies,  fuel  sources,  and  the  rest,  but  strongly  supported
ethanol  as  a  fuel  derived  primarily  from  cellulosic  material,  corn
stover,  switch  grass,  forest  cuttings,  and  things  of  that  sort  as  an
important  solution  to  part  of  our  problem.  The  oil  industry  has
tended  to  regard  ethanol  as  an  additive  over  the  years  past.  It  is
only two percent of our gas supply now. And I think that is 2.8 bil-
lion gallons a year. We see the need to boost that considerably and
offer a number of incentives to do that, but that has got to be part
of  our  future,  I  think,  and  particularly,  with  the  phase-out,  the
banning of MTBE as an oxygenate in many of our states, including
my own State of California.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mr. Gilchrest.
Mr. GILCHREST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First,  I  want  to  welcome  the  person  who,  on  the  Eastern  Shore,
is  affectionately  known  as  Bill  ‘‘Wetlands’’  Reilly.  Back  in  the  late
’80s,  early  ’90s,  we  had  a  full  range  of  issues  dealing  with  wet-
lands,  and  as  EPA  Administrator,  Mr.  Reilly  was  a  friend  of  the
State of Maryland, especially the Eastern Shore, and I just wanted
to make those comments, Bill.

It  is—Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me  that  we  have  an  issue  that
we have been dealing with for a number of decades that is environ-
mental,  it  deals  with  energy  security,  it  deals  with  safety,  and  it
deals  with  economics.  And  when  we  look  at  that,  and  we  hear  the
information  that  has  been  given  to  us,  both  from  your  testimony,
from  the  NRC  report,  Bill,  from  what  you  have  done  with  your  re-
search. I am looking at this either from a global marketplace or an
international marketplace issue. If we look at it from a global mar-
ketplace  issue,  this  is  free  market,  do  what  you  want,  the  bottom
line,  the  top  line  is  the  profit  margin.  But  I  think  this  has  to  be

72

an  international.  This  has  to  be  an  issue  with  the  marketplace,
which  gives  us  most  of  our  ingenuity  and  our  initiative,  on  new
technologies,  and  the  government’s  understanding,  and  you  might
want to comment on this, that there is a factor with CO2 and glob-
al warming. There is a factor with our security and energy depend-
ence,  especially  with  countries  like  China  moving  to  create  a  huge
demand on energy. And can we resolve the issue of safety? And can
we do it economically feasibly so we have a dynamic economy that
continues to be prosperous?

So I sort of frame that issue to ask just four quick questions. One
is,  Bill,  and  a  number  of  you,  mentioned  increase  production  as
part  of  a  whole  package.  Is  that  looking  both  foreign  and  domestic
or just domestic? Number two, Mr. Stanton, you said something in-
teresting  about  petroleum-dependent  transportation  sector,  or  I
think  I  heard  you  say  you  are  moving  away  from  the  petroleum-
dependent  transportation  sector.  And  that  sounds  like  it  is  pretty
good news. How long do you think that will take, and what can we
do  to  speed  that  up?  And  then,  Mr.  Greene—Dr.  Greene  and  a
number  of  people  have  mentioned  the  idea  of  CAFE  standards
versus a number of new technologies, weight-based standard versus
CAFE  standard.  So  where  are  we  on  that,  and  is  that  a  rec-
ommendation  specific  to  us?  The  last  one  is,  Bill,  you  mentioned,
you  know,  burning  corn  and  those  kinds  of  things,  ethanol.  Where
are  we,  and  can  we  move  in  certain  sectors  of  our  country,  espe-
cially in the rural areas, to add more soy oil to diesel fuel?

Those are my questions, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Who are you directing your question to, or

do you want to provide the answer, also?

Mr. GILCHREST. I don’t have my—I don’t have the answers. I am
just—if anybody would like to comment on that, or any of those——
Mr.  REILLY.  I  would  just  comment  quickly,  first  of  all  to  say  I
know  nothing  about  the  capacity  of  soy  oil  to  be  a  fuel,  but  I  have
been impressed in the course of our research over the past 2c years
that even turkey parts are being used in Carthage, Missouri to cre-
ate  liquid  fuels.  I  think  you  can  make  alcohol  out  of  virtually  any-
thing,  and  we  are  beginning  to  find  more  imaginative  ways  and
cheaper  ways  and  more—ways  that  are  more  efficient  in  the  use
of  energy  and  manufacturing,  and  that  is  what  some  of  these  eth-
anol possibilities are, I think.

You  mentioned  China.  That  first  question  you  had,  is  it  a  U.S.
or  is  it  a  worldwide  number?  The  number  that  I  began  with  is  an
excess—in  excess  of  50  percent  of  new  production  will  be  required
over  the  next  20  years.  It  is,  I  think,  43  percent  for  the  United
States  in  liquid  fuels,  in  oil  and  in  gas,  basically,  gasoline.  That
compares  with  a  20  percent  increase  in  production  worldwide  over
the period 1980 to 2000. Those contrasting numbers, a very signifi-
cant  difference,  suggests  to  me  that  we  are  not  going  to  make  it.
We  really  do  need  virtually  all  of  the  possibilities  that  we  can  ex-
plore and bring on with some degree of cost effectiveness.

Mr.  DULEEP.  On  the  issue  of  soy-based  diesel,  I—there  has  been
a lot of research on that, and it does look like a relatively expensive
option, so it is a tough sell at $1.50 or $2.00 a gallon for diesel fuel,
but it——

Mr. GILCHREST. It is a tough sell because of——

73

Mr. DULEEP. The cost of production.
Mr.  GILCHREST.—the  cost  of  production,  even  though  you  might
be  in  an  area  where  soybean  production  is  large?  It  would  still—
the cost of production to turn soybeans into soy oil is still not com-
petitive with traditional fossil fuels?

Mr.  DULEEP.  Relative  to  what  you  can  sell  the  soybeans  in  the
market for, it would be a difficult—it is just a hard thing to do. But
I understand there are other types of agricultural products they are
looking  at  to  make  diesel  fuel  from.  Now  ethanol  is  a  completely
different animal.

Chairman BOEHLERT. The gentleman’s time has expired.
Ms. Lofgren.
Ms. WOOLSEY. Woolsey is my name.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Lofgren.  Woolsey.  I  am  looking  here,  and

then I am looking there, and I am seeing two different things.

Ms. Woolsey.
Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well,  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  welcome  Mr.
Gilchrest to this committee. I am glad you are here, except for now
you have made my questions seem simplistic.

I  want  to  talk  about  consumers  and  getting  consumers  into  the
equation.  And  I  will  start  with  Mr.  Stanton.  I  mean,  we  talked
about a target audience on the Super Bowl ads, but there is some-
thing  about  supply  and  demand,  so  we  know  that  consumers  are
actually  waiting  for  hybrid  cars.  So  if  we  don’t—and  we  also  know
that  Americans  don’t  like  to  wait  for  anything,  but  they  are  actu-
ally  waiting  for  these  cars,  and  more  would  buy  them,  I  believe,  if
there—it  was  more  convenient  for  them  to  just  get  one  off  the  lot,
like  other  automobiles.  So  why  do  you  think  when  these  cars  are
popular that there aren’t enough of them yet?

Mr.  STANTON.  Well,  I  think  there  are  a  couple  of  reasons,  and  I
want  to  give  credit  to  one  of  my  members,  particularly  Toyota,  be-
cause  they  are  just  going  gangbusters  on  this,  and  they  have  just
announced  that  they  are  going  to  double  production  again.  And  I
think  that  is  wonderful.  We  are  finding  out  that  things  like  single
occupant HOV use in Virginia or California seems to be a great in-
centive  for  these  things,  and  we  are  generally  for  incentives  to  en-
courage  the  production  and  then,  of  course,  the  purchase  of  these
advanced-technology vehicles.

If I look at our membership in the Alliance, we have some mem-
bers  who,  right  now,  are  going  very  strong  on  hybrids,  and  other
members  are  going  very  hard  on  clean  diesel.  And  I  think  it  was
Mr.  Portney  who  said  it  earlier,  I  mean,  we  don’t  think  Congress
ought to try to pick winners and losers in technologies, but the race
is there. That is the point.

Who is going to win the race? I—we don’t know. I mean, hybrids
are  inherently  more  expensive,  because  they  have  got  two  power
plants. You have got the internal combustion engine, and then you
have got the battery. So clean diesel has some emission challenges.
Thanks to Congress, we are going to have 15 parts per million sul-
fur-fueled  beginning  in  2006.  We  hope  that  is  an  enabler  that  will
allow us to put the after-treatment on the diesel—on the clean die-
sels  so  that  we  will  be  able  to  certify  those  vehicles  and  they  will
meet  the  stringent  tier  two  emission  standards  to—that  come  into
effect or being phased in now.

So who wins? The consumer wins eventually. What we have pro-
posed,  and  what  we  would  like  to  see,  is  very  complex.  I  mean,  as
we talk about how to do this, Mr. Camp’s bill or the consumer cred-
its  that  were  in  the  Energy  Bill  last  year,  I  mean,  it  was  an  at-
tempt  to  balance  the  degree  of  technology,  the  fuel  economy  in-
crease,  and  the  gallons  saved  for  hybrids  versus  diesel  and  come
up with a package where everyone thought that that was relatively
neutral in supporting both technologies. And that is what we would
like to see happen. And then the consumer becomes the big winner.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Well, and the industry becomes a winner.
Mr. STANTON. Absolutely.
Ms.  WOOLSEY.  It  doesn’t  cost—I  mean,  the  automobile  industry

doesn’t lose money on hybrid cars, do they?

Mr. STANTON. They sure do in the beginning.
Ms. WOOLSEY. Well——
Mr. STANTON. There is no question that—you know, our industry
is spending $18 billion on research a year. I don’t want to say long
lead  time,  but  lead  time  extremely  important.  There  are  major  in-
vestments  in  new  technology.  And  you  tend  to,  you  know,  want  to
go a little slower than faster unless you know that you have a win-
ner.  And  I  think  you  are  seeing  in  the  marketplace  now  that  the
hybrid  turns  out  to  be  a  winner.  I  have  got  an  article  on  my  desk
that  shows  that  we  are  going  to  have  50  hybrid  models  by  2010.
This is phenomenal.

Ms. WOOLSEY. So how does—how do R&D credits work into that?

I mean——

Mr.  STANTON.  Well,  the  tax  credits  work  in,  because  the  incre-
mental cost increase is going to be less than the tax credit, but we
need  a  way  to  get  the  new  technology  into  the  marketplace.  And
if we want to accelerate the introduction—and we all recognize that
there  is  going  to  be  a  cost  differential.  If  we  can  get  the  cost  dif-
ferential down to where it is—the purchase price is roughly similar
to  a  comparable  internal  combustion  engine,  then  we  will  get  the
volumes up, and with the volumes up, the price comes down.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Well, thank you.
And  you  did  say  that  consumers  don’t  really  care  that  much.  I
represent  Marin  and  Sonoma  Counties,  just  north  of  the  Golden
Gate Bridge, if it matters.

Mr.  STANTON.  Not  all  consumers,  how  about—we  will  put  the

qualification there.

Ms. WOOLSEY. Thank you very much.
Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
Mr. Schwarz. Dr. Ehlers.
Mr. EHLERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Several  comments  before  I  get  to  questions.  First  of  all,  on  the
issue  of  hydrogen,  everyone  assumes  when  you  are  talking  hydro-
gen  that  it  has  to  be  fuel  cell,  and  I  agree  with  Mr.  Portney:  they
will  leave  the  options  open.  Those  are  two  separate  issues,  and
there  are  other  ways  of  using  hydrogen  besides  fuel  cell.  The—but
the main factor there with hydrogen is simply don’t get it from fos-
sil  fuels.  There  are  abundant  sources.  H2O  happens  to  be  fairly
abundant.  Unfortunately,  it  is  a  very  tight  chemical  bond,  but
again,  that  may  be  an  appropriate  place  for  high-temperature  nu-
clear reactors and getting away from fossil fuels.

I  would  also  like  to  comment  about  the  statement  about  market
forces.  A  number  of  people  have  talked  about  this  as  if  somehow
these  are  some  magic,  independent  things  that  automatically  lead
to  good  results.  And  that  assumes—that  kind  of  model  assumes
that people genuinely react to these market forces. But that ignores
certain things, and I have always had a—I have had a bone to pick
with the auto industry for a long time. In fact, I am the only Mem-
ber  of  Congress  from  Michigan  who  has  consistently  voted  against
the freezing CAFE standards, not that I am that enamored of high-
er  CAFE  standards,  but  we  have  to  face  this  issue.  And  the  auto
companies  simply  refuse  to  face  it.  And  my  bone  with  them  was
they  kept  talking  about  market  forces.  ‘‘We  are  just  making  what
the  people  want.’’  And  I  simply  remind  them  of  their  advertising
budget.  How  much  do  you  spend  advertising  SUVs  compared  to
how much do you spend advertising low-cost, high fuel economy ve-
hicles? It is very disproportionate. And we are not talking peanuts
here. If I buy a new car, I am paying about $400 for the advertising
that they bought to persuade me to buy the car.

And so market forces don’t operate in a vacuum. I think the auto
industry  has  taken  a  pass  on  that.  They  can  greatly  influence  the
choices consumers make through education, through advertising. A
part  of  the  problem,  and  part  of  the  reason  market  forces  don’t
work  very  well  is  the  public  simply  does  not  understand  energy.
They  can’t  see  it,  they  can’t  touch  it,  they  can’t  taste  it,  they  can’t
feel  it,  and  it  is  frustrating  to  me,  as  a  physicist,  because  that  is
one  thing  I  do  understand.  But  I  have  often  said  I  wish  energy
were purple. If energy were purple and people could see it and they
are  driving  down  the  highway  and  a  Toyota  Prius  comes  by  with
just  a  little  purple  around  it,  and  it  is  followed  by  an  SUV  with
a  big  purple  cloud,  people  are  going  to  say,  ‘‘Hey,  you  know,  I  am
going  to  get  one  of  those  Prius,’’  because  they  could  see  it.  They
could  see  the  impact.  As  it  is,  their  only  tie  to  reality,  in  terms  of
the  energy,  is  the  price  at  the  gas  pump.  And  that  is  a  little  too
ephemeral to directly affect their purchases.

I—now  enough  ranting  for  a  while,  except  that  I  wish  the  auto-

mobile companies would try to influence purchases.

I—Mr. Stanton, in your testimony, you state their approaches to
restructuring  the  CAFE  program,  that  would—can  help  address
competitiveness  concerns.  And  as  I  told  you,  I  am  not  enamorant
of the CAFE program, but I would be interested in what you meant
by  that.  What  ideas  do  you  have?  What  mechanisms  are  available
to more—to affect consumer choices so that they are more likely to
choose energy-efficient vehicles? I would appreciate your comments
on that, and then I am going to ask the rest of the panel, too.

Mr. STANTON. Mr. Ehlers, thank you.
Yeah,  I  think  that  there  are  ways  to  improve  the  program.  I
think that it was referenced earlier that, certainly, we have had 30
years  of  experience,  and  we  all  recognize  that  it  is  less  than  per-
fect. NHTSA is currently looking at an attribute-based system. The
NAS  is  looking  at  an  attribute-based  system.  There  are  certain
pluses  and  certain  minuses.  Those  are  ways  to  do  it.  The  com-
plexity  of  the  program,  and  from  Michigan,  you  understand,  cer-
tainly, that issues like two fleet credit and credit trading and some
people  like  that  very  much  and  other  people  don’t  like  that  very

much,  depending  upon  which  side  of  the  fence  you  sit.  But  we  are
looking  for  ways  to  further  the  fuel  efficiency,  and  I  hear  you  on
the  advertising—the  advertisement,  as  you  and  I  have  discussed
before.

Mr. EHLERS. I would like other comments. What alternatives are
there  to  CAFE  standards  that  you  really  think  would  be  workable
in  today’s  marketplace  that  would  really  affect  consumer  choices?
Dr. Greene.

Dr.  GREENE.  I  think  that  a  leading  contender  to  fuel  economy
standards  are  these  feebate  systems  in  which  we  have,  at  present,
a  gas-guzzler  tax,  which  is  kind  of  a  half  of  a  feebate  system.  It
is just a tax. And that gas-guzzler tax is quite steep. It is so expen-
sive that there virtually aren’t any gas-guzzler passenger cars sold.
There  is  no  comparable  tax  on  light  trucks,  so  we  have  a  strange
asymmetrical  situation  there.  But  it  is  very,  very  likely  that  a
feebate  system  would  work  well,  encouraging  both  consumers  to
buy more efficient cars and light trucks, and encouraging manufac-
turers  to  adopt  the  technology  to  avoid  fees  and  gain  rebates.  And
so I think as a market-based incentive, that deserves a careful look
as an alternative to CAFE standards.

Mr.  EHLERS.  Would  you—are  you  saying  you  should—that  we
should  try  to  apply  something  like  that  across  the  whole  market
spectrum?

Dr. GREENE. Well, there are two components of a feebate system.
One  is  the  pivot  point.  That  is,  what  MPG  level  defines  whether
you  get  charged  a  fee  or  you  get  a  rebate?  You  can  have  a  pivot
point  for  cars  and  a  different  one  for  trucks.  You  could  have  one
for  smaller  cars  or  larger  cars,  smaller  trucks.  You  can  have  as
many  as  you  like.  What  provides  the  incentive  to  the  manufactur-
ers, especially, to adopt technology is the rate. That is usually spec-
ified in terms of dollars per 0.01 gallons per mile so that every gal-
lon  of  gasoline  gets  the  same  rate—weight  in  this  incentive.  And
a  feebate  system  of  $500  to  $1,000  per  0.01  gallons  per  mile,  that
is about the difference between a 20- and a 25-mile-per-gallon vehi-
cle.  It  would  provide  a  very  strong  incentive,  both  to  the  manufac-
turers  and  to  the  consumers  to  get  a  more  efficient  vehicle.  These
systems  can  be  designed  so  the  pivot  points  make  the  system  rev-
enue neutral, that is you take in as much as you pay out.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Thank you very much.
The gentleman’s time has expired.
Mr. Schwarz.
Mr.  SCHWARZ.  We  have  talked  about—first,  let  me  say  that  my
District is right next to Congressman Ehlers’ District. And my Dis-
trict—in  my  District,  General  Motors  is  building  the  largest  plant
that  they  have  built  in  the  last  20  years,  and  I  am  delighted  to
have  them  there.  It  is  the  Delta  Township  plant,  the  Delta  plant
just  outside  of  Lansing,  Michigan.  You  have  talked  about
methyltertiary  butylether  gone  away.  You  can’t  use  that  anymore.
Ethanol  is  expensive  stuff,  not  generally  accepted  by  the  popu-
lation,  by  the  motoring  population  yet.  Biodiesel  is  a  great  idea.
There are some places—where I live in Michigan, they are actually
using  it  and  selling  it,  the  B20  with  biodiesel  from  soy  and  some
of  it  from  restaurant  grease  and  other  things  of  that  nature.  At

some  point,  the  industry  has  got  to  get  from  petrofuels  to  the  hy-
drogen society, the hydrogen environment.

So my question is briefly this, as someone who has thousands of
people  in  his  District  working  in  the  automotive  industry,  and
someone  from  the  State  of  Michigan,  what  is  the  best  policy  that
the Federal Government should develop or maintain toward the in-
dustry  that  gets  you  from  petrofuels  to  hydrogen  the  most  quickly
that it possibly can? Less regulation? More regulation? Change the
rules?  Leave  CAFE  standards  the  way—what  gets  us  there
quickest?

Mr.  STANTON.  Well,  I  will  take  the  first  stab  at  that.  Certainly
the  research  and  development  that  this  committee  has  been  sup-
portive  of  in  the  past,  and  we  need  to  continue  that  and  increase
that.  We  think  that  the  tax  credits  for  advanced-technology  vehi-
cles  is  certainly  a  good  way  to  go,  too.  We  are  not  saying  no  in-
creases  in  CAFE.  We  are  just  saying  make  sure  we  do  the  CAFE
increases  right  so  we  don’t  divert  resources  from  our  main  goal  to
having to meet incremental increases, which is not going to be the
big bang for the buck at the end of the day.

Mr. PORTNEY. If I could, Mr. Schwarz, thank you.
I agree with Mike that there are two pieces to this puzzle to has-
ten  the  onset  of  the  hydrogen  economy,  if  it  turns  out  that  that
really  is  the  energy  wave  of  the  future.  The  first  is  more  invest-
ment  in  research  and  development,  because  individual  companies
don’t  have  a  sufficient  incentive  to  invest  in  new  technologies,  be-
cause  other  people  can  then  ape  the  technologies  that  they  invent,
and they don’t get all of the benefits. So there is underinvestment.
But I think there also needs to be some incentive that—something
that  motivates  the  consumer  to  demand  more  fuel-efficient  cars,
and that can either take the form of higher gasoline prices or tight-
er fuel economy standards that the car companies have to meet.

If  I  could  add  one  more  thing,  I  actually  think  2005  will  be  the
most  important  year  for  people  who  pay  attention  to  fuel  economy
that  we  have  seen,  and  the  reason  I  say  that  is  that  if  one  looks
at the hybrid vehicles that we have had in the past, the Honda In-
sight,  the  original  version  of  the  Prius,  tend  to  be  cars  that  give
you  great  fuel  economy  and  this  hybrid  technology  but  not  a  lot  of
other amenities. So you have kind of sacrificed on the amenity side
to  get  improved  fuel  economy.  This  year,  we  will  see  the  Ford  Es-
cape SUV. We will see the Toyota or the Lexus HX–400, a very ele-
gant  SUV  hybrid.  We  see  the  Honda  Accord  now  hybridized,  and
we  will  see  the—both  Volkswagen  and  DaimlerChrysler  with  ad-
vanced  diesel  engines  in  much  more  upscale  cars.  And  if  we  see
this year great consumer acceptance of those vehicles, then I think
it  will  be  an  unmistakable  signal  to  car  makers  across  the  line,
both  in  the  passenger  car  and  the  light-duty  truck  segment  of  the
fleet, that this is something that the public is willing to pay for and
fuel  economy  really  does  have  a  strong  consumer  demand.  And  I
think that is going to go a long way toward creating a great incen-
tive for improved fuel economy, even without government interven-
tion, which, I would argue, probably still needs to take place.

Dr. GREENE. Let me endorse both of those recommendations that
have been made, and also add that if we want a—if we want hydro-
gen  from  renewable  sources,  then  we  probably  need  to  have  a  pol-

icy  for  controlling  carbon  emissions,  cap  and  trade  system,  some
kind of way of penalizing vehicles that emit greenhouse gases.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  Thank  you  very  much.  You  are  right  on

time. The gentleman’s time has expired.

Excuse me. I think we have pretty well established that we have
the technology right now to make cars and trucks get significantly
better  fuel  economy  without  any  detriment  to  safety.  I  think  that
is agreed by all.

The  question  is  still  on  the  table,  it  seems  to  me,  and  there  are
two  of  them.  First,  what  are  the  pros  and  cons  of  using  CAFE
standards to get that technology into the hands of consumers rath-
er  than  just  depending  on  the  markets?  And  the  second  one,  how
can  we  put  CAFE  standards  into  place  without  disproportionately
burdening U.S. manufacturers? A tall order. Who wants to take the
first crack at it?

Mr. DULEEP. Let me——
Chairman BOEHLERT. The centrist in the panel.
Mr. DULEEP. Let me just answer the first part of it, which is how
can we get these technologies. I think, as I pointed out in my open-
ing  statement,  and  as  Mr.  Stanton  pointed  out,  a  lot  of  these  are
going to come in, regardless of any actions by the Congress or not.
That—I  think  that  many  of  these  technologies  pay  for  themselves
and make sense in the marketplace. I think where there is a mar-
ket  failure  in  this  constantly  increasing  consumer  demand  for  at-
tributes that are rapidly eroding some of these benefits of the tech-
nologies, and there has been reference made to it. And I think that
is  where  there  is  perhaps  more  disagreement  on  how  one  might
capture  the  technology  benefits  in  terms  of  fuel  economy  benefits
rather  than  benefits  in  acceleration  performance  or  other  at-
tributes.

And the second part of it, on the CAFE issue, I am fairly certain,
and  I  think  Dr.  Greene  will  back  me  up  on  this,  is  that  if  the—
meeting a single-number target for all companies is definitely—cre-
ates  distortions  in  terms  of  competitive  impacts  between  manufac-
turers. And any attribute-based standard, we have found in our re-
search,  is  somewhat  better  than  the  current  CAFE  standard.  But
we also came to the conclusion that there is no real perfect way to
do  it,  and  that  almost  anything  you  do  involves  some  degree  of
compromise.  And  so  I  think  it  is  just  a  matter  of  defining  those
compromises  and—rather  than  the  fact  we  are  ready  to  accept
them.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Mr. Reilly.
Mr.  REILLY.  The  question  of  whether  or  not  the  onset  of  hybrids
does  disadvantage  American  auto  manufacturers  is  one  that  we
took very seriously. And I must say, coming into that conversation,
I  was  skeptical  that  it  would.  We  concluded—our  consultants  con-
cluded that there is a risk of loss of U.S. jobs to American manufac-
turers  and  that  the  reason  for  that  is—in  a  word  is  because  the
technologies  that  we  are  talking  about  here,  advanced  diesel  and
hybrids,  are  German,  primarily,  and  Japanese,  primarily.  They
are—when  they  are  brought  to  this  united—these  United  States,
they  are,  very  often,  under  contract  or  franchised  with  some  of
those who have developed those technologies.

79

Chairman BOEHLERT. Is that because they have regulations that

require that in Japan and Germany?

Mr. REILLY. It is possible that that has played a role. It certainly
has  stimulated  much  more  attention  to  some  of  these  issues  on  a
more urgent basis, I think, particularly in Japan. But for that rea-
son, we did propose significant manufacturer incentives of a billion
and  a  half  dollars  over  10  years  to  manufacturers  for  producing
these  vehicles  in  the  United  States,  for  all  manufacturers,  Toyota
included  to  the  extent  that  they  manufacture  in  the  U.S.  We  had
those  proposals  vetted  by  trade  lawyers  to  determine  whether  or
not  these  were  consistent  with  international  trade  agreements,
with  the  World  Trade  Organization.  They  concluded  that  they
were,  that  they  are,  and  that  this  is  an  important  way  to  get  the
introduction of the technologies. And I think they are game chang-
ing  technologies.  I  have  been  involved  with  this  issue  for  a  long
time.  What  is  truly  new  now  is  we  have  technologies  available  to
us  that  can  get  significant  improvements  in  automobile  fuel  effi-
ciency  that  we  didn’t  have  10  years  ago.  So  I  think  finding  a  way
to  get  them  introduced  with  the  least  disadvantage  to  American
manufacturers and workers is the way to go, and that is the reason
for  the  incentives  that  we  proposed.  We  also  had  consumer  incen-
tives that I mentioned.

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  What—you  know,  let  me  just  ask.  It  is—
I  think  it  is  a  national  security  imperative  to  reduce  oil  demand,
and I think we all—can all accept that. Can we just rely on market
forces  to  do  that,  or  is  there  something  more  than  market  forces
that we have to engage in? And you are recommending—obviously,
you  are  recommending  something  more  than  market  forces,  and  I
think Dr. Portney is, too.

Mr.  REILLY.  Well,  I  strongly  prefer  the  use  of  market  forces,  be-
cause  that  aligns  the  interests  of  consumers  with  the  interests  of
manufacturers.

Chairman BOEHLERT. Well, I understand that, and we all do.
Mr. REILLY. Right.
Chairman BOEHLERT. I mean, I don’t think you will get any dis-
agreement  there.  Everybody  raise  their  hand.  We  prefer  market
forces, but if market forces aren’t doing what needs to be done, and
we  have  a  national  security  imperative  to  reduce  demand  for  oil
and  look  at  the  emerging  giants  in  India  and  China,  the  demand,
you  know—there  is  not  an  unlimited  supply  of  oil  around  the
world. And you—well——

Mr.  REILLY.  Well,  if  the  question  is  if  you  could  not  use  higher
prices  as  a  way  to  create  demand  for  more  fuel  efficient  vehicles,
do  I  think  that  there  is  an  appropriate  role  for  the  government,
through  tightening  CAFE  standards.  I  do,  but  there  I  would  come
back  to  the  point  that  I  made  before,  that  I  would  only  do  that  if
I gave up on the use of market forces, which I am not prepared to
do,  and  it  is  so  important  that  car  makers  be  given  sufficient  time
to  do  this,  rather  than  be  required  to  get  unrealistically  high  im-
provements  in  unrealistically  short  periods  of  time,  because  then
we  are  back  to  downsizing  and  downweighting,  which  was  a  coun-
terproductive way to go about this, I think, in the first place.

80

Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  we  established  the  fact  that  it  is  not
necessary to downsize and downweight to get the increased fuel ef-
ficiency that we are looking for. We have established that fact.

Mr. REILLY. Well, we have established that——
Chairman BOEHLERT. You know, I can remember well.
Mr. REILLY. Yeah, we have established that if the car makers are
given  a  sufficient  period  of  time.  If  you  said  we  are  going  to——
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  And  we  all  agree  that  they—what  they

should be given, so, you know——

Mr. REILLY. But in that case, fine——
Chairman  BOEHLERT.—a  period  of  time.  We  can’t  say,  ‘‘Do  it  to-

morrow.’’

Mr. REILLY.—I absolutely—right. Right.
Chairman  BOEHLERT.  I  mean,  what—you  know,  I  applauded  the
President  last  January  14  when  he  announced  his  space  explo-
ration  initiative,  and  you  know,  he  took  an  agency  where  they  are
still wearing black arm bands in the aftermath of the demise of the
Columbia,  and  they  were  in  a  collective  funk,  and  he  said,  you
know—he  inspired  them,  you  know,  for  future  space  exploration.
But to his credit, he said, ‘‘We are not going to do it tomorrow, and
don’t write me a blank check.’’ And I am very mindful of the people
that  Mr.  Stanton  represents.  I  don’t  want  to  just  shove  something
down the throat of the industry and say, ‘‘We have got to do it right
away.’’  We  have  got  to  be  sensitive  to  their  very  legitimate  con-
cerns. But what comforts me today is the positive approach saying
that we have got to work together to accomplish something that we
agree  is  a  legitimate  national  security  objective.  Now  we  might
have  some  differences  on  timetable,  but  we  are  not  focusing  from
one side of the argument all our energy on fighting something that
we  all  agree  is  necessary.  Now  we  may  have  some  differences  on
timetable.

And  finally,  I  would  say  on  customer  demand,  and  everybody
keeps  talking  about  customer  demand,  and  I  agree,  but  I  will  tell
you,  I  think,  I  feel  strongly  that  customer  demand  is  ignited,  in
large measure, by what all of us are exposed to in advertising. And
I would—and I go back to, once again, the auto industry came for-
ward  with  airbags  before  they  were  mandated  by  the  government.
And a lot of the captains of industry were on television selling safe-
ty.  And  you  know  what,  in  my  house,  like  a  lot  of  houses  across
the  country,  my  wife  said,  ‘‘Boy,  that  is  something  I  want  for  me
and for our kids and grandkids.’’

So  I  think  we  are  all  in  this  together.  I  hope  that—Dr.  Portney,
I  am  going  to  take  you  up  on  your  offer.  We  will  follow  it  up  in
writing.  You  said  you  would  be  glad  to  convene  something  and
maybe we can get, you know—from people in the auto industry and
the Alliance to sit down and sort of talk together to try to sort this
thing out. It is very, very important. And I know one of the things
you  are  including  in  your  market  forces  is  increasing  taxes,  and  I
will  tell  you  this,  we  are  very  skittish  about  that,  and  with  legiti-
mate reason, because there are ways to accomplish the same objec-
tive  without  increasing  taxes.  So—but  I  understand  that  is  one  of
the market forces that is an option that you would suggest we take
a look at. And let me say we should look at all options.

But  with  that,  let  me  say  thank  you  very  much.  You  know,  we
will  follow  up,  probably,  with  a  few  questions  for  each  of  you,  and
we  would  appreciate  a  timely  response.  But  this  has  been  a  very

some good back and forth—good participation from up here. I really
appreciate it. We did something worthy of note here today.

Questions submitted by Representative W. Todd Akin
Q1. If  the  CAFE  program  has  been  successful,  could  you  please  explain  why  we  are
more  dependent  on  foreign  oil  today  and  consuming  more  gasoline  in  our  vehi-
cles  than  we  were  when  the  program  was  originally  put  into  place?  And  if  that
is  the  case,  how  will  increasing  the  CAFE  requirements  to  higher  levels  reverse
this trend and accomplish the original goals of CAFE?

A1. Was CAFE successful? In a study published in 2002 entitled ‘‘Effectiveness and
Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards,’’ the National Acad-
emy of Sciences found that fuel use by passenger vehicles is roughly one-third lower
today  than  it  would  have  been  had  fuel  economy  not  improved  since  1975.  CAFE
was identified as a ‘‘major reason’’ for the fuel economy improvement. The NAS esti-
mated  a  2.8  million  barrel  per  day  savings  between  1975  and  2000,  or  14  percent
of current U.S. consumption (?20 million barrels per day).

If CAFE was successful, why are we consuming more oil? We are consuming more
oil  because  vehicle  miles  traveled  (a  function  of  increasing  numbers  of  vehicles  on
U.S. roadways and the trend towards driving greater distances each year) have out-
stripped  the  oil  savings  achieved  by  improved  fuel  economy  in  the  late  1970s  and
1980s.  The  figure  to  the  right  from  the  NAS  report  shows  vehicle  miles  traveled
(VMT) increasing steadily since 1966. Fuel use declined between 1978 and 1983 due
to improved vehicle fuel economy and a decline in the use of oil by electric utilities,
but has risen steadily since then as passenger vehicle fuel economy levels have stag-
nated. Source of Figure: NAS CAFE report at page 19.

If CAFE was successful, why are oil imports increasing? Oil imports are increasing
because  domestic  production  has  declined  steadily  since  1970,  and  domestic  con-
sumption  has  continued  to  grow,  although  at  slower  rate  than  what  might  have
been  given  CAFE  and  other  factors.  The  figure  to  the  right  is  from  EIA’s  Annual
Energy  Review  (2003)  which  provides  statistics  on  petroleum  production,  consump-
tion by sector, trade, storage, prices, refinery activities and the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve.  Since  the  peak  of  U.S.  crude  oil  production  in  1970  of  9.6  MBD,  domestic
production has declined 40 percent and now rests at 5.7 MBD. Over the next twenty
years,  the  Energy  Information  Administration  in  its  Annual  Energy  Outlook  2005
forecasts  a  slight  increase  in  U.S.  oil  production  over  the  next  five  years,  followed
by a slow but steady decline until 2025.

How will increasing CAFE reverse the trend of increasing consumption and rising
oil  imports  and  thus  accomplish  its  original  goals?  The  fact  that  the  U.S.  economy
has not gone into a recession despite $50 for a barrel of crude oil is in part because
efforts over the last thirty years to begin to wean our economy off oil have been suc-
cessful.  The  figure  to  the  left  excerpted  from  the  Commission’s  report  shows  that
the  oil  economic  intensity  of  the  U.S.  economy  (that  is,  the  amount  of  oil  needed
to  produce  a  dollar  of  GDP)  was  halved  over  the  last  30  years.  Increasing  CAFE
can  reverse  the  trends  of  increasing  consumption  and  rising  imports,  but  the  in-
crease  would  have  to  be  larger  than  two  percent  per  year  to  offset  the  annual  rise
in VMT. But the point here is that even a more modest increase in CAFE can help
insulate the economy from future oil price shocks and generally high oil prices.

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. In your testimony you said that recent research by your colleagues suggests that
the ‘‘rebound’’ effect—people driving more because improvements in fuel economy
make it cheaper to do so—might cancel out the economic and environmental ben-
efits of improving fuel economy. To what extent were the energy security benefits
of improving fuel economy taken into account?

A1. The  rebound  effect  has  only  to  do  with  how  much  gasoline  will  be  saved  by
tighter  standards—it  does  not  bear  on  the  question  of  the  good  that  is  done  by  re-
ducing  consumption.  If  people  drive  a  little  more  because  their  cars  get  better  fuel
economy  (and  hence  the  cost  of  driving  an  additional  mile  are  reduced),  that  just
means  that  we’ll  save  less  gasoline  through  tighter  CAFE  standards  than  appears
at first blush.

The  NAS  committee  indeed  took  into  account  energy  security  benefits—assigning
them  a  ‘‘shadow  value’’  of  $5/barrel  of  oil  consumed,  which  at  the  time  was  about
20  percent  of  the  price  of  a  barrel  of  oil  (more  like  10  percent  now).  This  is  a  very
important question, of course, but it is unrelated to the debate over the rebound ef-
fect.
Q2. In discussing the potential of technology to reduce fuel consumption, you empha-
sized  the  importance  of  the  ability  of  the  individual  consumer  to  recoup  the  ad-
ditional costs of fuel efficient technology through gasoline savings. But if reduc-
ing the Nation’s dependence on oil is a public good, why not emphasize the level
of  fuel  savings  that  maximizes  the  benefit  to  the  public  as  a  whole?  Why  not
think of fuel economy standards as similar to pollution emissions requirements,
in  which  individual  consumer  repayment  is  not  as  important  a  consideration?
A2. In  fact,  the  right  way  to  think  about  the  benefits  of  improved  fuel  economy  is
to  combine  the  benefits  to  the  consumer  from  reduced  gasoline  consumption  with
the social benefits from internalizing the climate change and oil import dependence
externalities.  The  NAS  Committee  thought  it  was  worthwhile,  though,  to  analyze
the effects of tighter standards purely from the standpoint of the car buyer. Depend-
ing  upon  the  period  over  which  gasoline  savings  are  calculated,  and  upon  the  dis-
count  rate  used  to  compare  future  savings  with  present  outlays,  tighter  standards
look attractive purely on economic grounds alone.

This  is  somewhat  deceiving,  however,  because  a  rational  car  buyer  might  think
to  herself,  ‘‘Fine,  I’ll  save  more  gasoline  over  the  life  of  this  car  than  I’ll  have  to
shell  out  in  a  higher  purchase  price.  But  what  if  the  car  companies  could  use  the
money  they  are  required  to  spend  on  tighter  fuel  economy  instead  on  developing
other conveniences for me? It’s at least possible that I’d like those new features even
more than the fuel economy savings I’ll be getting now.’’

This isn’t an unrealistic scenario, though it gets more and more unrealistic as gas-
oline gets more and more expensive. In other words, the higher the cost of gasoline,
the less likely it is that car buyers will prefer heated cup-holders or whatever other
options might be invented to improved fuel economy.

Questions submitted by Representative W. Todd Akin
Q1. You served as Chair of the NAS panel that reviewed the CAFE program in 2001.
Did  your  panel  recommend  any  specific  CAFE  standards?  Could  you  explain
some  of  the  complexities  and  policy  tradeoffs  that  must  be  considered  in  taking
information  on  future  technologies  and  assessing  the  increases  in  vehicle  and
fleet  fuel  economy  that  may  be  possible  from  implementing  those  technologies?
A1. The  NAS  Committee  did  not  recommend  any  specific  CAFE  standards.  Deter-
mining  those  standards  involves  a  set  of  complicated  tradeoffs  that  can  only  be
made by elected or appointed officials of the Federal Government.

The  complicated  tradeoffs  include  such  things  as  the  safety  of  vehicle  occupants,
the  cost  and  reliability  of  new  vehicles,  the  fuel  savings  that  would  result  from
tighter  standards,  the  reduced  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  associated  with  im-
proved  fuel  economy  and  many  other  factors  that  are  spelled  out  clearly  in  the  re-
port.
Q2. If  the  CAFE  program  has  been  successful,  could  you  please  explain  why  we  are
more  dependent  on  foreign  oil  today  and  consuming  more  gasoline  in  our  vehi-

cles  than  we  were  when  the  program  was  originally  put  into  place?  And  if  that
is  the  case,  how  will  increasing  the  CAFE  requirements  to  higher  levels  reverse
this trend and accomplish the original goals of CAFE?

A2. This is an easy one. The fact that we consume more gas today than we did be-
fore  the  CAFE  standards  were  put  in  place  does  NOT  necessarily  indicate  that  the
program  was  unsuccessful.  That  depends  on  how  much  gasoline  we  consume  today
compared  to  the  level  that  would  exist  had  we  not  implemented  CAFE  standards
in  the  late  1970s.  It  was  very  clear  to  the  NAS  panel  that  while  fuel  consumption
has  gone  up  significantly  since  then,  it  would  have  gone  up  by  much  more  had  the
CAFE program not been put in place—particularly after the fall in gas prices during
the 1980s.

While there are clearly pros and cons to even tighter standards—again, all spelled
out  in  some  detail  in  the  NAS  report,  no  one  doubts  that  they  would  reduce  the
amount of gasoline used. Some believe that the savings wouldn’t be worth the costs,
while  others  have  a  different  view.  But  NO  ONE  argues  that  tighter  CAFE  stand-
ards  in  the  future  will  fail  to  reduce  gasoline  consumption  relative  to  the  current
baseline.

Responses  by  K.G.  Duleep,  Managing  Director  of  Transportation,  Energy  and  Envi-

ronmental Analysis, Inc.

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. In  your  testimony  you  called  the  demand  for  400,  500  and  600  horsepower  en-
gines  ‘‘astounding’’  since  the  speed  limit  in  this  country  rarely  exceeds  70  miles
per hour. What effect do you believe this increase in horsepower will have on fuel
economy? On safety?

A1. Large  increases  in  horsepower  do  affect  fuel  economy  and  safety  if  vehicles.
Typically a 10 percent increase in horsepower decreases fuel economy by 2.5 percent
if the vehicle technology level is unchanged and the horsepower gain is achieved by
engine  upsizing.  Larger  increases  in  horsepower  of  20  percent  or  more  also  require
improvements  to  the  brakes,  tires  and  the  drive  line,  thereby  increasing  vehicle
weight  and  causing  additional  losses  in  fuel  economy  over  and  above  the  effect  of
engine  upsizing.  The  doubling  of  horsepower  that  has  occurred  over  the  last  20
years has led to an implied loss in fuel economy of about 30 to 35 percent.

It  is  more  difficult  to  provide  a  quantitative  estimate  on  safety  effects,  since  the
vehicle  safety  statistics  are  profoundly  influenced  by  driver  behavior.  In  the  past,
high  horsepower  engines  were  typically  associated  with  sports  cars,  which  have  a
poor  safety  record.  Now,  very  powerful  engines  are  being  offered  in  many  conven-
tional  cars  but  it  is  not  clear  if  their  accident  and  fatality  rates  will  be  similar  to
those  of  sports  cars  with  similar  engines,  due  to  differences  in  the  types  of  con-
sumers who drive these vehicles. I would still expect some increase in accident and
injury rates since it is much easier to drive these powerful vehicles aggressively.
Q2. You  have  emphasized  the  importance  of  the  ability  of  the  individual  consumer
to  recoup  the  additional  costs  of  fuel  efficient  technology  through  gasoline  sav-
ings. But if the government chose to improve fuel economy to benefit the Nation
by reducing our dependence on oil, why shouldn’t it approach the issue more like
it  does  the  setting  of  requirements  to  control  pollution  emissions,  in  which  con-
sumer repayment is not a consideration?

A2. My  testimony  did  emphasize  the  ability  of  consumers  to  recoup  the  costs  of
technology through savings from reduced fuel consumption, and I do not believe the
situation is the same as setting emission standards for criteria pollutants. The com-
mittee appeared most interested in achieving increased fuel economy by setting fuel
economy  standards  that  auto  manufacturers  must  comply  with,  but  have  no  direct
effect  on  consumer  demand.  Moreover,  there  appears  to  be  little  appetite  in  Con-
gress for restricting consumer choice of vehicle size and power. Hence, manufactur-
ers  faced  with  consumer  demand  for  larger,  more  powerful  cars  and  lack  of  con-
sumer interest in fuel economy will have considerable

difficulty  in  selling  technology  that  is  perceived  by  the  consumer  to  cost-ineffec-
tive.  In  contrast,  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  are  not  a  function  of  vehicle  size
and power (due to the catalyst cleaning up 99 percent of engine-out emissions) and
meeting  emission  standards  is  effectively  de-coupled  from  the  issue  of  consumer
choice  of  vehicle  attributes.  The  California  zero-emissions  vehicle  mandate  departs
from historical emission standards by requiring a certain percentage of vehicles sold
by  each  manufacturer  to  be  a  hybrid  or  electric  vehicle.  This  regulation  presents
problems  similar  to  those  posed  by  fuel  economy  regulations,  especially  if  hybrids
are perceived as cost-ineffective by a majority of consumers.

Questions submitted by Representative W. Todd Akin
Q1. Since  all  of  the  automakers  are  in  different  places  in  terms  of  the  current  use,
potential use and even applicability of the various technologies you have identi-
fied to their products, can you explain how you are able to evaluate the potential
for  increasing  the  fleet  fuel  economy  levels?  Aren’t  there  going  to  be  ‘‘winners’’
and ‘‘losers’’ in the process of dramatically increasing CAFE standards as some
have suggested?

A1. We recognize that different manufacturers are in different positions with regard
to technology deployment and vehicle sales mix, but we do track technology and fuel
economy at the vehicle make and model level and can derive fuel economy potential
for each manufacturer. The fleet fuel economy improvements cited in my testimony
are  simply  a  sales-weighted  average  of  individual  manufacturer  capability  but  my
testimony also makes the point that a single fuel economy standard for all manufac-

turers  could  disadvantage  many  manufacturers.  The  current  CAFE  standard  im-
poses  a  single  standard  for  cars  and  another  for  all  light  trucks,  regardless  of  the
mix  of  cars  or  trucks  sold  by  any  specific  manufacturer.  Historically,  this  single
standard approach has created problems for GM, Ford, Chrysler and European lux-
ury  car  manufacturers.  This  could  continue  to  be  true  in  the  future,  but  the  mag-
nitude  of  the  effect  is  declining  due  to  mergers  and  acquisitions  in  the  industry.  In
addition, the Japanese and Korean manufacturers are gradually entering all market
segments including low fuel economy segments like fullsize pickup trucks and SUV,
where  no  imports  were  offered  in  the  past.  Dr.  Greene  of  Oak  Ridge  National  Lab-
oratory  and  I  have  explored  other  types  of  standards  such  as  size  class  or  weight
specific  fuel  economy  standards,  and  these  appear  to  be  better  than  the  single
standard approach used in the historical period.
Q2. If  the  CAFE  program  has  been  successful,  could  you  please  explain  why  we  are
more  dependent  on  foreign  oil  today  and  consuming  more  gasoline  in  our  vehi-
cles  than  we  were  when  the  program  was  originally  put  into  place?  And  if  that
is  the  case,  how  will  increasing  the  CAFE  requirements  to  higher  levels  reverse
this trend and accomplish the original goals of CAFE?

A2. Many  detailed  analyses  of  the  CAFE  standard  conducted  by  the  government
conclude  that  it  was  effective  in  reducing  gasoline  consumption  during  the  1980–
1990  period.  Of  course,  the  CAFE  standards  for  cars  set  in  1975  by  Congress  are
still in force today at the same level of 27.5 mpg while light-truck CAFE standards
have also continued for the last 20 years with almost no change. Hence, the benefits
of  these  standards  have  long  since  been  swamped  by  population  growth,  increases
in  car  ownership,  and  increased  driving  per  car.  Future  increases  in  CAFE  stand-
ards  will  also  have  only  a  short-term  effect  if  the  standards  are  left  unchanged  for
decades.  It  is  also  possible  that  historical  increases  in  car  ownership  will  not  occur
as we approach saturation, and future increases in travel per vehicle may be much
lower due to increasing congestion and traffic. If historical growth rates of these pa-
rameters  are  reduced  in  the  future,  then  the  benefits  of  CAFE  standards  may  be
more durable.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses  by  Michael  J.  Stanton,  Vice  President  of  Government  Affairs,  Alliance  of

Automobile Manufacturers

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. You  suggest  in  your  testimony  that  to  advance  the  adoption  of  new  technologies
to  improve  fuel  economy,  the  government  should  enact  tax  credits  for  the  pur-
chase  of  advanced  technology  vehicles.  However,  if  CAFE  standards  were  to  re-
main constant, since they are based on a fleet-wide average, the purchase of ad-
vanced high efficiency vehicles could be off-set by the sale of more fuel inefficient
vehicles or the deployment of these technologies for greater power or size, result-
ing  in  little  or  no  change  in  the  overall  consumption  of  fuel  by  the  fleet.  How
do  we  avoid  this  outcome  when  supporting  incentives  for  the  purchase  of  ad-
vanced vehicles?

A1. Your  question  gets  to  the  heart  of  one  of  the  problems  of  the  CAFE  program.
There is nothing that says the consumer must purchase ‘‘fuel economy.’’ The CAFE
program  only  says  that  vehicle  manufacturers  must  produce  a  fleet  that  averages
a  certain  fuel  economy  level  regardless  of  what  consumers  want  or  choose  to  pur-
chase.  The  auto  industry  today  makes  over  100  models  that  achieve  30  or  better
miles per gallon on the highway, yet the sales of these vehicles are very low.

The  purpose  of  the  incentives  is  to  make  it  economical  for  the  manufacturer  to
offer these advanced technology vehicles, since there is a premium to produce these
vehicles.  The  proposed  consumer  tax  incentives  are  for  a  very  limited  time.  They
will help increase production volumes and consequently reduce costs, enabling man-
ufacturers  to  provide  highly  fuel-efficient  vehicles  with  the  attributes  consumer’s
value.

We can’t change consumer-purchasing habits, but we can make some of these ad-
vanced technology vehicles in the most popular vehicle lines. There are already two
hybrid-electric  SUVs  available  and  more  are  planned  for  production.  There  is  also
a diesel-powered SUV available. It is the manufacturers task to introduce advanced
technologies in vehicles that consumers want to purchase.
Q2. You  have  emphasized  the  importance  of  the  ability  of  the  individual  consumer
to  recoup  the  additional  costs  of  fuel-efficient  technology  through  gasoline  sav-
ings. But, if the government chose to improve fuel economy to benefit the Nation
by reducing our dependence on oil, why shouldn’t it approach the issue more like
it  does  the  setting  of  requirements  to  control  pollutant  emissions,  in  which  con-
sumer repayment is not a consideration?

A2. There  are  two  important  distinctions  between  the  national  program  to  control
tailpipe emissions and the CAFE program. Over the past four decades, manufactur-
ers  developed  and  implemented  very  effective  emission  control  technology.  In  fact,
today’s vehicles have 99 percent fewer smog-forming pollutants than vehicles of the
1970s.

These  emission  reductions  were  achieved  in  a  way  that  was  invisible  to  the  con-

sumer.

Unlike smog-forming pollutants, there are no ‘‘catalysts’’ that can be put on a ve-
hicle to improve its fuel economy. Although several technologies to improve fuel effi-
ciency have been introduced in the fleet, it can take 20 years to develop and imple-
ment a single new technology.

The other main way to improve fuel economy is to make vehicles lighter. This in-
volves  either  making  vehicles  smaller  or  using  advanced  materials  for  constructing
the  vehicle,  which  may  not  be  cost-effective.  Unfortunately,  history  shows  that  con-
sumers  do  not  value  or  purchase  in  large  numbers  small  cars  with  good  fuel  econ-
omy.

Once  consumers  purchase  these  vehicles  and  get  some  experience,  Consumer  in-
centives  to  purchase  advanced  technology  vehicles  will  spur  the  sale  of  these  vehi-
cles  resulting  in  greater  consumer  acceptance  and  greater  consumer  willingness  to
invest in these technologies.

A1. No, the Alliance does not support legislative increases to CAFE standards. Con-
gress  clearly  assigned  the  task  of  setting  CAFE  standards  to  NHTSA.  NHTSA  has
the  expertise  and  a  great  deal  of  experience  in  carrying  out  its  statutory  obligation
to  set  maximum  feasible  standards  considering  technological  feasibility,  economic
practicability,  the  effect  of  other  motor  vehicle  standards,  and  the  need  of  the  U.S.
to  conserve  energy.  NHTSA  enacted  the  largest  increase  ever  for  light  trucks  when
it  set  standards  for  the  2005–2007  model  years.  Now,  NHTSA  is  working  on  a  pro-
posal  that  will  set  standards  and  revamp  the  CAFE  program  for  2008  and  later
models years.
Q2. If  the  CAFE  program  has  been  successful,  could  you  please  explain  why  we  are
more  dependent  on  foreign  oil  today  and  consuming  more  gasoline  in  our  vehi-
cles  than  we  were  when  the  program  was  originally  put  into  place?  And  if  that
is  the  case,  how  will  increasing  the  CAFE  requirements  to  higher  levels  reverse
this trend and accomplish the original goals of CAFE?

A2. The  CAFE  program  has  been  successful—the  average  fuel  economy  of  the  pas-
senger car fleet doubled from around 13 mpg in the mid 1970s to 27.5 mpg in 1985.
However,  programs  that  succeed  in  reducing  oil  demand  have  always  increased,  in
percentage  terms,  the  world’s  dependence  on  the  most  insecure  sources  of  supply.
As  demand  falls,  the  market  share  of  high-cost  non-OPEC  producers  falls,  and  the
market share of low-cost Middle Eastern OPEC producers rises.

In terms of overall fuel consumption, there are many unintended consequences of
the  CAFE  program.  When  consumers  are  able  to  buy  cars  that  get  better  mileage,
in  a  low  fuel  price  environment,  consumers  will  drive  more  miles.  Vehicle  miles
traveled have been increasing exponentially over the last decade or more. Since the
enactment  of  the  original  CAFE  standards,  consumers  have  purchased  more  light
trucks,  which  are  now  over  50  percent  of  the  market.  These  vehicles  are  generally
less  efficient  than  passenger  cars,  but  they  provide  greater  carrying  capacity  and
the ability to tow heavy loads, which most passenger cars today can’t.

Increasing  the  CAFE  standards  as  they  are  currently  structured  will  not  reverse
this trend, because the same unintended consequences will occur. The CAFE stand-
ards are a requirement for manufacturers to make more fuel-efficient cars and light
trucks, but there is nothing that says consumers have to buy more fuel-efficient ve-
hicles. The auto industry today makes over 100 models that achieve 30 mpg or more
on the highway, but sales of these vehicles are relatively low compared to the over-
all  fleet.  NHTSA  should  be  left  with  the  job  of  weighing  all  of  the  competing  de-
mands placed on the industry and setting a standard that takes all of that into ac-
count.

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by David L. Greene, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Center for Transpor-

tation Analysis, National Transportation Research Center

Questions submitted by Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert
Q1. In his testimony, Dr. Portney said that recent research by his colleagues suggests
that  the  ‘‘rebound’’  effect—people  driving  more  because  improvements  in  fuel
economy  make  it  cheaper  to  do  so—might  cancel  out  the  economic  and  environ-
mental  benefits  of  improving  fuel  economy.  Do  you  agree?  Would  consideration
of the energy security benefits of improving fuel economy affect your answer?

A1. I do not agree that the rebound effect would cancel the benefits of fuel economy
improvements  brought  about  by  higher  fuel  economy  standards  set  at  an  appro-
priate level.

In general, a reduction in the cost of operating a car brought about by improving
fuel  economy  will  be  partially  to  entirely  offset  by  an  increase  in  the  price  of  the
vehicle. This is an extremely important point that is generally overlooked in analyses
of the rebound effect. The premise of the rebound effect is that increasing fuel econ-
omy reduces the cost of operating a vehicle by reducing the amount of fuel required
per  mile  of  travel.  Estimates  of  the  rebound  effect  published  in  the  economics  lit-
erature  measure  the  effect  of  reduced  fuel  cost  per  mile  of  travel  (price  per  gallon
divided  by  miles  per  gallon)  on  the  amount  of  travel,  other  things  equal.  However,
when  manufacturers  raise  fuel  economy  in  response  to  higher  standards  they  do  so
primarily by adding more expensive fuel economy technology, thereby increasing the
cost  of  the  vehicle.  Whether  the  increased  cost  of  this  technology  will  be  less  than
or  greater  than  the  value  of  fuel  saved  is  usually  a  subject  of  heated  debate,  and
in  any  case  will  depend  on  how  high  the  standards  are  set.  Regardless,  in  the  long
run the cost of operating a vehicle depends on the cost of the vehicle as well as the
cost  of  fuel  (plus  other  costs  such  as  insurance,  maintenance,  etc.,  some  of  which
may  increase  with  vehicle  price).  Thus,  in  the  long  run,  the  rebound  effect  due  to
lower fuel costs will be at least partially and possibly entirely offset by the increased
cost  of  fuel  economy  technology.  I  will  provide  a  simple  illustration  below  to  show
how important this effect can be.

Second,  when  fuel  economy  increases  significantly,  motor  fuel  tax  revenues  drop
dramatically.  Since  motor  fuel  taxes  are  overwhelmingly  user  fees  that  finance  the
construction  and  maintenance  of  highways,  Federal  and  State  governments  must
find some way to replace the lost revenue. Historically, they have done this by rais-
ing  motor  fuel  tax  rates.  Current  federal  and  State  motor  fuel  taxes  average  $0.38
per  gallon  (excl.  sales  taxes).  If  fuel  economy  standards  were  raised  by  50  percent,
for  example,  the  increase  in  fuel  economy  would  eventually  cause  tax  revenues  to
drop by  B. To restore the lost revenue the total tax would have to increase to $0.57,
an increase of $0.19 or about 10 percent of the price of gasoline (at $2/gallon). Such
a tax increase would further erode the rebound effect, as I will illustrate below.

Finally,  while  historical  estimates  of  the  rebound  effect  (the  elasticity  of  travel
with  respect  to  fuel  cost  per  mile)  are  in  the  vicinity  of  ¥0.2,  the  rebound  effect
has  been  decreasing  over  time,  (1)  as  fuel  costs  have  decreased  as  a  share  of  total
vehicle operating costs, and (2) as consumers’ incomes rise. In 1985, fuel costs com-
prised  20  percent  of  total  vehicle  operating  costs;  in  2003,  fuel  accounted  for  only
12 percent of operating costs. As fuel becomes a smaller share of the cost of driving,
motorists  become  less  sensitive  to  both  fuel  prices  and  fuel  economy.  In  addition,
as consumers’ incomes rise, they become less sensitive to fuel costs. The most recent
analysis  of  the  rebound  effect  by  Professors  Kenneth  Small  and  Kurt  Van  Derider
of  the  University  of  California  at  Irvine  found  a  long-run  rebound  elasticity  for  the
U.S.  of  ¥0.24  for  the  period  1966–2001.  This  is  quite  similar  to  my  1999  study  of
this  subject  which  found  a  long-run  elasticity  of  ¥0.23.  However,  for  the  most  re-
cent  five-year  period  using  values  of  income  for  the  State  of  California  Small  and
Van Dender found the long-run rebound effect had fallen to ¥0.09. Projecting future
income  growth  in  California,  they  calculated  expected  rebound  values  of  ¥0.08  for
2005  and  ¥0.04  for  2020.  The  current  value  of  the  long-run  rebound  elasticity  is
therefore probably close to  ¥0.1, with smaller values appropriate for evaluating fu-
ture fuel economy impacts.

It  is  instructive  to  combine  these  elements  in  a  sample  calculation.  Suppose  fuel
economy  regulations  require  a  50  percent  increase  in  light-duty  vehicle  fuel  econ-
omy.  This  will  produce  a  33  percent  decrease  (1/1.5  =  0.67)  in  fuel  cost  per  mile.
Evaluated using alternative rebound elasticity values of ¥0.2 and ¥0.1, this would
imply  a  6.7  percent  or  a  3.3  percent  increase  in  vehicle  travel,  respectively.  If  we

assume that the increase in vehicle price for technologies to achieve these fuel econ-
omy  gains  will  be  two  thirds  of  the  value  of  fuel  saved,  then  the  net  decrease  in
long-run  vehicle  operating  costs  would  be  only  11  percent.  This  would  produce  an
increase in vehicle travel between 1.1 percent and 2.2 percent. If we add to this the
assumption  that  motor  fuel  taxes  will  increase  by  $0.19  per  gallon,  and  that  this
amounts  to  9.5  percent  of  the  cost  of  gasoline  at  $2.00/gallon,  then  the  total  long-
run  decrease  in  the  operating  cost  of  a  vehicle  is  1.5  percent,  for  which  we  would
estimate  a  rebound  effect  of  between  0.3  percent  and  0.15  percent.  Obviously,  the
numbers  used  in  this  example  are  approximations.  Nevertheless,  taking  into  ac-
count  the  fact  that  increased  fuel  economy  will  increase  the  price  of  vehicles  to-
gether with the likelihood that governments will respond to losses in highway reve-
nues by raising motor fuel taxes can reduce the rebound effect to a truly negligible
factor.

From  the  above  example  it  is  clear  that  the  smaller  the  price  increase  caused  by
higher fuel economy standards is relative to the fuel savings they produce, the larg-
er  the  rebound  effect  will  be.  If  the  price  increase  is  larger  than  the  value  of  fuel
savings,  the  rebound  effect  could  be  negative  (i.e.,  an  increase  in  vehicle  operating
costs  and  a  decrease  in  miles  traveled).  My  point  is  that  one  cannot  have  it  both
ways. Either fuel economy standards cause a net decrease in vehicle operating costs,
in  which  case  there  is  a  rebound  effect  but  also  a  substantial  economic  benefit  to
car buyers, or there is a net increase in operating costs, in which case there should
be  no  rebound  effect.  If  the  fuel  economy  standards  are  set  near  the  point  at  which
the  value  of  fuel  savings  equals  the  price  increase,  the  rebound  effect  should  be  neg-
ligible.

Finally, I believe that Dr. Portney was referring to not just the environmental im-
pacts of the rebound effect, but to the full range of potential external costs of vehicle
travel,  which  in  previous  studies  by  RFF  have  included  congestion  and  safety
externalities, among others. According to Harrington and McConnell (2003) non-en-
vironmental  external  costs  may  be  several  times  the  environmental  external  costs.
In  my  view,  we  should  not  let  the  existence  of  safety,  congestion  and  air  pollution
problems  prevent  us  from  addressing  our  oil  dependence  problem.  Instead,  we
should address all these problems with appropriate and well targeted solutions.
Q2. In discussing the potential of technology to reduce fuel consumption, you empha-
sized  the  importance  of  the  ability  of  the  individual  consumer  to  recoup  the  ad-
ditional costs of fuel efficient technology through gasoline savings. But if reduc-
ing the Nation’s dependence on oil is a public good, why not emphasize the level
of  fuel  savings  that  maximizes  the  benefit  to  the  public  as  a  whole?  Why  not
think of fuel economy standards as similar to pollution emissions requirements,
in  which  individual  consumer  repayment  is  not  as  important  a  consideration?
A2. Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  clarify  my  view  on  this  subject.  I  entirely
agree that reducing oil dependence is a public good and that the value to the Nation
of  reducing  oil  dependence  should  be  a  key  factor  in  determining  the  appropriate
level of vehicle fuel economy. However, in studying the costs of improving light-duty
vehicle fuel economy I have observed two relevant phenomena. First, it appears that
technology  costs  increase  rapidly  beyond  the  point  at  which  the  total  cost  of  an  in-
crease  in  fuel  economy  exceeds  the  total  present  value  of  fuel  savings.  This  is  usu-
ally  significantly  above  the  fuel  economy  level  at  which  the  marginal  value  of  fuel
savings  equals  the  marginal  cost.  Second,  trying  to  increase  fuel  economy  by  using
pricing  to  shift  vehicle  sales  in  favor  of  higher  mpg  configurations  (rather  than
using  fuel  economy  technology)  appears  to  be  a  very  expensive  strategy.  My  intent
in  making  the  observation  that  the  level  of  fuel  economy  standards  should  be  set
close to the level at which the total value of fuel saved equals the total cost of tech-
nology  used  to  achieve  those  savings  was  to  suggest  a  reasonable  range  in  which
the  socially  optimal  level  of  fuel  economy  is  likely  to  be  found.  In  my  opinion,  this
will be above the point at which the marginal cost of improving fuel economy equals
the marginal value of fuel saved but below the point at which the total value of fuel
saved equals the total cost of improving fuel economy. Of course, technology is con-
stantly changing and therefore the most beneficial level of fuel economy from a soci-
etal perspective will change, as well.

Questions submitted by Representative W. Todd Akin
Q1. If  the  CAFE  program  has  been  successful,  could  you  please  explain  why  we  are
more  dependent  on  foreign  oil  today  and  consuming  more  gasoline  in  our  vehi-
cles  than  we  were  when  the  program  was  originally  put  into  place?  And  if  that
is  the  case,  how  will  increasing  the  CAFE  requirements  to  higher  levels  reverse
this trend and accomplish the original goals of CAFE?

A1. Establishing  fuel  economy  standards  was  effective  in  raising  fleet  average  fuel
economy,  reducing  U.S.  petroleum  consumption,  and  reducing  our  oil  dependence.
During  the  years  in  which  we  required  continuous  increases  in  light-duty  vehicle
fuel  economy  (from  1978  to  1985)  our  oil  dependence  steadily  decreased.  When  oil
prices (not coincidentally) collapsed in 1986, we abandoned that successful strategy.
By leaving the fuel economy standards essentially constant for the past 20 years we
have allowed growing travel demand to overtake the new vehicle fuel economy gains
achieved  by  1985.  The  principal  factors  driving  the  growth  of  travel  demand  have
been  increasing  population,  increasing  levels  of  income  and  economic  activity,  and
the continuing geographical dispersion of both people and the built environment.

Our  oil  dependence  problem  has  worsened  considerably  since  1985  because  we
stopped  requiring  fuel  economy  to  increase  while  at  the  same  time  our  ability  to
produce  petroleum  domestically  continued  to  decline.  The  amount  of  oil  we  import
equals  the  amount  we  consume  minus  what  we  produce.  U.S.  production  has  been
falling  since  1970  due  to  depletion  of  our  oil  resources.  In  1970,  the  U.S.  produced
11.3  million  barrels  per  day  of  petroleum  (crude  oil  plus  natural  gas  liquids);  in
2003 we produced only 7.5 million barrels per day.1 U.S. petroleum consumption in
1970 was 14.7 million barrels per day. Petroleum use increased to 18.8 million bar-
rels  per  day  in  1978,  the  first  year  in  which  the  CAFE  standards  were  in  force.
From  that  level,  U.S.  petroleum  consumption  decreased  to  15.7  million  barrels  per
day  in  1985,  for  practical  purposes  the  last  year  in  which  the  CAFE  standards  in-
creased.  The  reduction  in  petroleum  consumption  from  1978  to  1985  was  achieved
despite a 15 percent increase in miles traveled by light-duty vehicles over the same
period  (from  1,426  billion  vehicle  miles  in  1978  to  1,637  billion  in  1985).2 Because
it  takes  more  than  10  years  to  turn  over  most  of  the  stock  of  light-duty  vehicles,
the benefits of higher new vehicle fuel economy persisted beyond 1985 even though
the  rate  of  growth  in  vehicle  travel  exceeded  the  rate  of  increase  in  fuel  economy.
By  1992,  the  turnover  of  the  stock  of  vehicles  was  nearly  complete  and  on-road
light-duty  vehicle  fuel  economy  reached  a  plateau  of  approximately  19.5  miles  per
gallon. Had light-duty vehicle fuel economy remained at the 1978 level of 13.6 mpg,
the  2,078  billion  miles  traveled  by  passenger  cars  and  light  trucks  in  1992  would
have required 46 billion gallons (three million barrels per day) more petroleum than
it did.

Depending on the fuel economy standards chosen, raising fuel economy standards
alone may or may not be sufficient to reverse the trend of increasing oil dependence.
In general, increasing energy efficiency alone is not a complete strategy for address-
ing  oil  dependence.  Increasing  domestic  petroleum  and  alternative  fuel  supplies  is
equally  important,  and  harnessing  market  forces  to  promote  both  efficiency  of  en-
ergy  use  and  increased  energy  supply  is  key.  Equally  important  to  these  strategies
is  continuously  expanding  the  technological  potential  to  increase  energy  efficiency
and  substitute  alternative  energy  sources  for  petroleum  through  research.  In  my
opinion,  raising  the  fuel  economy  standards  is  an  essential  part  of  an  effective  en-
ergy security strategy but not a sufficient strategy by itself.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. DAVID L. BODDE

Professor  and  Director  of  Innovation  and  Public  Policy,  International  Center  for

Automotive Research, Clemson University

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to comment on Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and their capacity to encourage fuel-saving innova-
tion  in  automobiles  and  light  trucks.  The  thoughts  that  follow  are  my  own  and  not
necessarily  the  views  of  Clemson  University  or  its  International  Center  for  Auto-
motive Research.

In summary, my thesis rests on three points:

• Near-term improvements in fuel economy can most likely be achieved through
more  stringent  CAFE  standards.  But  these  gains  will  soon  dissipate  unless
efficiency-enhancing innovation becomes an ongoing process.
• CAFE  standards,  by  themselves,  cannot  move  light  vehicles  from  mere  com-

pliance to continuous improvement. This is true for two reasons:

Æ CAFE standards operate on the supply side of the market. They do noth-

ing to promote consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles.

Æ CAFE  standards  take  no  cognizance  of  the  entrepreneurial  sector  of  the
economy.  Therefore  they  are  irrelevant  to  the  most  dynamic  force  for
change in a free society, the wellspring of ‘‘creative destruction’’ that has
led  technological  revolutions  in  fields  as  diverse  as  telecommunications,
computing, and medicine.

• If more aggressive CAFE standards are authorized, then I would suggest con-
sideration  be  given  to  policies  that  could  supplement  regulation  with  incen-
tives for continuous innovation.

In what follows, I will set out the evidence that supports this thesis.

The  Limits  of  Standards  in  Promoting  Ongoing  Fuel  Efficiency  Innovation
The balance of evidence supports two premises as true. The first is that the origi-
nal CAFE standards contributed to the sharp increase in vehicle fuel efficiency that
occurred in the decade from 1975 to 1985. To be sure, analysis cannot clearly distin-
guish  the  effects  of  the  regulation  from  the  effects  of  the  fuel  price  increase  over
that same period. But at the very least, the CAFE standards contributed to the im-
provement—and  they  surely  prevented  a  decline  in  efficiency  as  fuel  prices  fell  in
the late 1980s.

Second,  the  evidence  strongly  supports  a  conclusion  that  the  technology  required
for meaningful improvement is readily at hand. For example, the 2002 report of the
National Research Council1 found that technologies capable of meaningful improve-
ments  in  fuel  efficiency  now  exist  but  are  not  applied  to  passenger  cars  and  light
duty vehicles. Other statements presented to this Committee corroborate this view.2
And yet, if this Committee were to hold these hearings 10 years from now, the same
would  be  said—the  ongoing  advance  of  science  in  many  fields  will  ensure  that  the
frontier  of  the  possible  remains  well  ahead  of  what  is  actually  achieved.  The  key
issue  then  concerns  how  to  achieve  rapid  and  continuous  application  of  these  re-
sults.

These premises hold important implications. The current situation does not differ
markedly from that of 1975, when the Energy Policy and Conservation Act first put
fuel  efficiency  standards  in  place.  Then,  as  now,  the  public  need  for  fuel  efficiency
was far stronger than could be expressed by price in the marketplace. Then, as now,
technologies offering potential improvement were available, but not in use. Then as
now, the evidence suggested some differential impact on auto manufacturers. Thus,
we  can  reasonably  expect  that  a  new,  more  aggressive  set  of  standards  would
achieve similar results: a onetime, marked improvement in vehicle fuel performance,
followed by a period of much diminished gains.

If that outcome is satisfactory, then CAFE alone would be satisfactory. But if the
aim  of  energy  policy  is  to  achieve  something  more,  then  consideration  should  also
be  given  to  ways  of  nurturing  fuel-saving  innovation  as  an  ongoing  process.  And  to
that subject that we now must turn.

The Process of Innovation: Implications for Fuel Efficiency

99

At the beginning, it might be helpful to review some general principles regarding
technological innovation and how it advances performance throughout the economy.
We  should  begin  by  understanding  technology  from  the  customer  perspective—not
as a ‘‘thing,’’ but as a service.

Technology  Viewed  as  a  Service:  Fuels  and  vehicles  have  little  value  in  them-
selves,  but  enormous  utility  as  providers  of  mobility  services.  For  road  transpor-
tation, these valued services include performance vectors like:

time with frequent refueling?

avoid accidents and by its ability to survive them?

• time saving: will the vehicle travel far enough that the driver does not waste
• safety:  how  well  does  the  vehicle  protect  its  occupants,  both  by  its  ability  to
• comfort: can the vehicle mitigate the stress and hassles of road travel for the
• image: what does driving this particular vehicle say about its occupants?
• ancillary  services:  does  the  vehicle  have  enough  generating  capacity  to  meet

driver and passengers?

the growing demand for on-board, electricity-based services?

At  any  time,  consumers  emphasize  some  of  these  performance  dimensions  while
sacrificing  along  others.  Consider  the  consumer  preferences  revealed  by  an  EPA
analysis  of  automobile  performance  from  1981  to  2003.  Over  this  period,  average
horsepower  nearly  doubled  (from  102  to  197  horsepower),  weight  increased  mark-
edly  (from  3201  to  3974  lbs.),  and  the  time  required  to  accelerate  from  zero  to  60
mph dropped by nearly 30 percent. One task of policy should be the addition of fuel
efficiency to the competitive performance dimensions for road transportation.

Technology-based  Innovation:  Accumulating  Technological  innovations  can  be
grouped  into  two  general  classes:  those  that  advance  performance  by  accumulating
incremental improvements, and those that offer discontinuous leaps in performance.
The  term  accumulating  applies  to  technologies  that  advance  performance  along  di-
mensions  already  recognized  and  accepted  by  customers.  Each  improvement  might
be  incremental,  but  the  cumulative  effect  compounds  to  yield  markedly  improved
performance—consider  the  improvements  in  processor  speed  for  computers,  for  ex-
ample.  Auto  manufacturers  are  accustomed  to  competing  along  these  dimensions,
and  the  cumulative  effect  can  lead  to  important  advances—but  only  if  the  tech-
nology  competition  continues  long  enough  for  the  gains  to  accumulate.  Most  of  the
fuel saving technologies discussed at this hearing are incremental in nature, and so
nurturing this kind of innovation could become an important policy goal.

Technology-based  Innovation:  Discontinuous:  In  contrast,  discontinuous  tech-
nologies introduce performance dimensions quite distinct from what the mainstream
customers have come to value, sometimes offering inferior performance along the ac-
customed dimensions. Because of their inferior mainstream performance, these tech-
nologies  initially  gain  traction  only  in  niche  markets.  With  continued  use  and  im-
provement, however, discontinuous technologies gain adequacy along the original di-
mensions and then enter the mainstream markets.

Consider the electric car, for example. Many analysts have written off electric ve-
hicles  because  of  their  inferior  performance  in  mainstream  auto  markets—accelera-
tion,  range,  and  recharge  time.  Yet  electric  vehicle  technologies  are  emerging  in  an
important  niche:  the  market  for  personal  transportation.  This  includes  golf  carts,
all-terrain vehicles, touring vehicles for resorts, transportation within gated commu-
nities,  and  so  forth.  In  that  market,  the  chief  performance  dimensions  are  conven-
ient access, economy, and ease of use—and style. The current state of electric vehi-
cle  technology  is  adequate  for  the  limited  range  and  acceleration  requirements  of
this  niche.  But,  could  electric  vehicle  technology  advance  to  the  point  of  entry  into
mainstream  markets?  Or,  could  it  compete  effectively  in  personal  transportation
markets  in  developing  countries—say  Thailand  or  China?  That  is,  of  course,  un-
knowable.  But,  please  recall  that  the  personal  computer  was  once  considered  a
hobbyists  toy,  inherently  without  enough  power  to  enter  mainstream  applications.
Discontinuous  innovation  tends  to  be  the  province  of  the  entrepreneur,  and  the
companies  that  such  persons  found  become  platforms  for  the  innovations  that  radi-
cally change all markets. Yet entrepreneurs often have low visibility relative to the
market  incumbents  in  policy  discussions,  and  their  companies  are  far  from  house-
hold  words.3 This  is  because  the  entrepreneurs’  story  is  about  the  future,  not  the

present;  about  what  could  be  and  not  about  what  is.  For  that  reason,  policies  that
encourage entrepreneurship in technologies relevant to reducing fuel use should be-
come part of the energy policy conversation.
Policy Options to Promote Fuel Saving Innovations

Two general strategies could be considered to supplement the CAFE approach by
encouraging  ongoing  innovation  in  fuel-efficient  technologies:  building  market  de-
mand  for  these  innovations,  and  nurturing  the  entrepreneurial  sector  to  supply
them.

Building Market Demand: The price of the fuel offers most obvious way to encour-
age  fuel  saving  innovations,  and  motor  fuel  taxes  provide  the  most  direct  leverage
if this component of policy is to be considered. We must, however, distinguish among
short-term  and  long-term  effects,  and  include  consideration  of  consumer  expecta-
tions.

For  the  short-term,  consumers  can  respond  to  increased  motor  fuel  prices  in  only
two ways: by changing their driving patterns, or by paying more for fuel and reduc-
ing  their  consumption  in  other  areas.  The  evidence  suggests  some  mix  of  these  re-
sponses. For the longer-term, consumers can exchange their capital stock—the vehi-
cles they drive—for more fuel efficient models. In both cases, this adaptive behavior
will depend upon consumer expectations for the magnitude and duration of the fuel
price  increase.  Adaptive  behavior  diminishes  to  the  extent  that  consumers  believe
the price increase will prove impermanent. We should observe also that every coun-
try  relying  on  fuel  economy  standards  also  matches  them  with  meaningful  motor
fuel taxes.

The so-called ‘‘freebates’’ program offers an alternative to taxes. This has been ca-
pably  discussed  elsewhere,4 and  needs  no  further  comment  here.  The  effectiveness
of income tax deductions for the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles will depend upon
the  tax  status  of  the  individual  purchaser.  The  incentive  is  further  blunted  by  the
complexities of the tax code and by the delay in receipt of the benefit.

In general, any policy that increases consumer incentives to purchase fuel efficient
vehicles  will  provide  an  incentive  for  ongoing  innovation—provided  that  the  policy
is  perceived  as  permanent.  Entrepreneurs  and  innovators  respond  primarily  to  op-
portunity;  but  that  opportunity  must  be  durable  for  the  10-year  cycle  required  to
establish a new high-growth company.

Nurturing an Entrepreneurial Culture in Fuel Saving: Policies to build the market
for  fuel  saving  technologies  operate  on  the  ‘‘demand’’  side  of  entrepreneurship  and
innovation.  In  addition,  several  policies  could  be  considered  to  build  an  entrepre-
neurial climate on the ‘‘supply’’ side. These include:

• Special  tax  consideration  for  investors  in  new  ventures  offering  products  rel-
evant to fuel savings. The intent would be to increase the amount of venture
capital available to startup companies.
• Commercialization  programs  might  enable  more  entrepreneurs  to  bring  their
nascent  technologies  up  to  investment  grade.  For  example,  an  enhanced  and
focused  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR)  program  might  increase
the number of participating entrepreneurs participating in fuel-relevant mar-
kets.  A  portion  of  the  Advanced  Technology  Program  (ATP)  could  be  focused
in like manner.
• Outreach  from  the  National  Laboratories  to  entrepreneurs  might  be  im-
proved.  Some  laboratories,  the  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory
(NREL) for example, offer small, but effective programs. But more systematic
outreach,  not  to  business  in  general,  but  to  entrepreneurial  business,  would
also increase the supply of market-ready innovations.

Executive Director, Institute for the Analysis of Global Security (IAGS)

PREPARED STATEMENT OF DR. GAL LUFT

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:

It  is  an  honor  to  be  invited  to  submit  this  testimony  to  this  distinguished  Com-
mittee  on  the  important  issue  of  improving  the  fuel  efficiency  of  America’s  vehicle
fleet. I currently serve as executive director of the Institute for the Analysis of Glob-
al Security (IAGS), an energy security research institution. I’m also representing the
Set  America  Free  coalition,  a  coalition  of  national  security,  foreign  policy  and  envi-
ronmental groups dedicated to promote a blueprint for energy security which focuses
on  reduction  of  U.S.  oil  demand  in  the  transportation  sector.  Among  the  groups  in-
volved  in  the  coalition  are  IAGS,  the  National  Defense  Council  Foundation,  the
Hudson Institute, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, the Center for Se-
curity Policy, and the Natural Resources Defense Council.

I  would  like  to  address  the  strategic  context  of  our  current  dependence  on  im-
ported oil and its implications on national security and offer new approaches to the
fuel efficiency debate.
The Strategic Impact of Our Oil Dependence

In  2004  oil  prices  have  grown  by  close  to  40  percent.  As  a  result,  the  United
States  spent  more  than  $18  million  per  hour  on  foreign  oil.  In  the  same  period  of
time,  OPEC’s  oil  export  revenues  grew  by  42  percent  to  $338  billion.  According  to
the  U.S.  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  throughout  2005  oil  prices  will
continue  to  stay  high  and  OPEC  will  rake  $345  billion  in  revenue.  This  transfer  of
wealth  of  historical  proportions  is  not  only  exacting  a  hidden  tax  on  the  American
economy but is also undermining our national security and the security of the world
at large. It is unfortunate that most major oil producing countries are either politi-
cally unstable and/or at odds with the U.S. Some of the world’s largest oil producing
nations  are  sponsors  of  or  allied  with  radical  Islamists  who  foment  hatred  against
the  U.S.  The  petrodollars  we  provide  such  nations  contribute  materially  to  the  ter-
rorist  threats  we  face.  In  time  of  war,  it  is  imperative  that  our  national  expendi-
tures on energy be redirected away from those who use them against us.

Beyond  the  underwriting  of  terror,  our  present  dependency  creates  unacceptable
vulnerabilities. As we have learned from Osama bin Ladin’s messages, al Qaeda ter-
rorists  know  that  oil  is  the  Achilles  heel  of  the  world  economy  and  disrupting  the
world’s oil supply is central to their efforts to defeat the U.S. and its democratic al-
lies. In Iraq and Saudi Arabia, America’s enemies have demonstrated that they can
advance  their  strategic  objective  by  attacking  critical  oil  infrastructure  and  per-
sonnel.  In  Iraq  alone  there  have  been  more  than  200  attacks  against  pipelines  and
oil  installations  in  the  past  20  months.  These  targets  are  readily  found  not  only  in
the  Mid  East  but  also  in  other  regions  to  which  Islamists  have  ready  access  such
as the Caspian Basin and Africa. Over time, these attacks are sure to become more
sophisticated  and  their  destructive  effects  could  be  difficult,  costly  and  time-con-
suming to undo.

In the longer run America’s national security can be adversely influenced by Chi-
na’s growing demand for oil. Chinese oil consumption is increasing seven times fast-
er  than  that  of  the  U.S.  and  its  imports  have  grown  by  over  35  percent  per  year
for  two  consecutive  years.  All  signs  indicate  that  China’s  appetite  for  oil  will  con-
tinue  to  grow  in  the  years  to  come.  According  to  the  International  Energy  Agency,
by 2030 China will import more oil than the U.S. does today. There is no doubt that
China’s  robust  economic  growth  has  already  been  felt  on  the  global  energy  scene
and  has  been  a  major  contributor  to  last  year’s  spike  in  prices.  More  importantly,
China’s demand for energy and other raw materials and its hunt for steady oil sup-
plies in areas where the U.S. has strategic interests could undermine Sino-American
relations. The U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group cre-
ated by Congress to examine the national security implications of the bilateral trade
and economic relationship between the two countries, warned in its 2004 report that
China’s growing dependence on imported oil is a key driver of its relations with ter-
rorist-sponsoring  governments.  The  report  said:  ‘‘China’s  approach  to  securing  its
imported petroleum supplies through bilateral arrangements is an impetus for non-
market  reciprocity  deals  with  Iran,  Sudan,  and  other  states  of  concern,  including
arms  sales  and  WMD-related  technology  transfers  that  pose  security  challenges  to
the United States.’’ There is growing recognition within the oil industry that the rise
of  China  will  bring  about  a  bidding  war  for  Middle  East  supply  between  East  and
West. Dave O’Reilly, chief executive of ChevronTexaco warned recently against alli-
ances formed between Asian countries and Middle East entities, calling for the U.S.
Government  to  recognize  and  understand  the  implications  of  such  a  geopolitical

102

shift.  Without  a  comprehensive  strategy  designed  to  prevent  China  from  becoming
an oil consumer on par with the U.S., the U.S. might find itself in the future facing
aggressive  competition  from  China  over  access  to  Middle  East  oil  with  grave  impli-
cations for global security.
U.S. Approach to Oil Dependence

In  light  of  intensifying  military  involvement  in  the  Middle  East,  terrorist  attacks
on  oil  infrastructure,  persistently  high  global  oil  prices,  and  the  rise  of  China,  oil
dependence  has  become  an  incipient  national  security  emergency.  To  address  the
problem  of  our  dependence  on  volatile  suppliers,  the  U.S.  has  pursued  a  three-part
strategy:

• Diversifying sources;
• Managing inventory in a strategic reserve;
• Increasing the transportation sector’s energy-consumption efficiency

The  first  pillar  of  our  strategy  is  no  more  than  a  stopgap  solution.  In  May  2001,
when  the  Bush  administration  released  its  National  Energy  Policy,  it  proposed  to
reduce  dependence  on  Middle  East  oil  dependence  by  targeting  alternative  oil-sup-
plying  nations  for  government  investment  and  closer  alliances,  including  Angola,
Azerbaijan, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Russia, and Venezuela. All of these na-
tions  are  undemocratic,  vulnerable  to  global  terrorism  and  face  significant  political
and social instability. Increasing U.S. reliance on these states would do little to ad-
dress  U.S.  security  and  economic  threats  stemming  from  oil  dependency.  Given  the
integrated  nature  of  the  world  economy  we  accomplish  nothing  if  we  merely  shift
our  own  purchases  of  oil  from  one  of  the  world’s  regions  to  another.  An  oil  crisis
will  affect  all  our  economies,  regardless  of  the  source  of  our  own  imports.  Further-
more,  non-OPEC  reserves  are  being  depleted  almost  twice  as  fast  as  OPEC’s.  This
will  ensure  that  our  dependence  on  OPEC  will  only  grow  as  time  goes  by.  With
OPEC countries sitting in the driver’s seat with respect to the world’s oil supply and
oil prices, the world’s economic and political future will be compromised.

Inventories are a critical element of energy security. But they are limited in scale
and only useful to address a short term supply disruption. However, at this moment
most  major  oil  consuming  nations  do  not  have  significant  strategic  petroleum  re-
serves.  This  means  that  a  supply  disruption  will  still  send  international  oil  prices
to  the  roof  regardless  of  how  much  stock  is  kept  in  the  U.S.  Though  over  time  it
would  be  advisable  to  see  more  countries  developing  robust  strategic  petroleum  re-
serves,  such  action  at  the  point  of  high  oil  prices  would  only  create  additional  de-
mand and hence drive prices up even further.

Since  the  Arab  oil  embargo  in  1973  several  sectors  of  the  economy  significantly
reduced  their  dependence  on  oil.  The  power  sector  is  a  particular  example:  today,
only  two  percent  of  U.S.  electricity  is  generated  from  oil.  The  transportation  sector
accounts  for  o  of  U.S.  oil  consumption,  about  o  of  that  being  gasoline  and  most  of
the rest diesel. Improving fuel efficiency in U.S. vehicles is the only course of action
which  carries  no  negative  consequences.  On  the  contrary,  studies  show  that  by  re-
ducing  demand  for  oil  in  the  transportation  sector  and  transitioning  the  economy
into  an  economy  based  on  next  generation  fuels  and  automobiles,  the  U.S.  could
generate millions of new jobs and billions of dollars worth of investment opportuni-
ties.
New Approach to Fuel Efficiency

In  the  past  three  decades  the  debate  on  improving  fuel  efficiency  has  focused
mainly on the tension between auto manufacturers, consumers and the government.
Though everybody agrees that the U.S. should reduce its oil bill neither Detroit nor
the American consumer is willing to do so for the greater good. The U.S. auto indus-
try shies away from embarking on revolutionary changes in its designs and produc-
tion  lines  and  by  and  large  resists  significant  rise  in  CAFE  standards.  The  Amer-
ican consumer is growingly minded to the need to reduce oil dependence but is still
unwilling  to  accept  compromise  on  cost,  comfort,  power  or  performance.  To  end  the
stalemate  in  the  fuel  efficiency  issue  we  need  to  change  the  terms  of  the  debate.
Today  when  it  comes  to  CAFE  the  auto  industry  shoulders  the  entire  burden.  But
long-term security and economic prosperity depends on technological transformation
not  only  at  the  vehicle  level  but  also  in  the  fuel  that  powers  it.  In  other  words,  to
get  people  to  travel  more  miles  per  gallon  of  gas  one  need  not  focus  only  on  rede-
signing the car, making it lighter or improving its engine. We should think in terms
of gallon stretchers—making our fuel more efficient. For example, a number of com-
mercially available fuel additives can enhance combustion efficiency by up to 20 per-
cent.  Most  of  these  additives  are  made  from  organic  materials  and  are  environ-
mentally  friendly.  By  reducing  the  size  of  the  oil  droplets  they  bring  to  more  effi-

103

cient  combustion.  Such  additives  can  be  blended  into  gasoline,  diesel  and  bunker
fuel.

An  even  better  way  of  reducing  the  content  of  gasoline  in  the  fuel  tank  can  be
done  by  mixing  gasoline  with  alternative  fuels  and  using  the  blend  in  flexible  fuel
vehicles  (FFVs)  that  can  be  readily  available  at  low  marginal  cost  and  that  require
no  change  in  auto  design.  FFVs  are  designed  to  burn  on  alcohol,  gasoline,  or  any
mixture  of  the  two.  About  four  million  FFVs  have  been  manufactured  since  1996.
The  only  difference  between  a  conventional  car  and  a  flexible  fuel  vehicle  is  that
the latter is equipped with a different control chip and some different fittings in the
fuel line to accommodate the characteristics of alcohol. The marginal additional cost
associated  with  such  FFV-associated  changes  is  currently  under  $150  per  vehicle.
That  cost  would  be  reduced  further  as  volume  of  FFVs  increases,  particularly  if
flexible fuel designs were to become the industry standard.
Alcohol fuels that can be used in FFVs:

• Ethanol  is  currently  produced  in  the  U.S.  from  corn.  In  2004,  the  U.S.  pro-
duced over 3.2 billion gallons of ethanol, and the market has increased on the
average  of  25  percent  per  year  over  the  past  three  years.  Almost  all  our  eth-
anol  comes  from  corn  and  is  being  used  either  as  an  additive  to  gasoline  or
as E–85. Upping production of ethanol would be achieved by continuing to ad-
vance  the  corn-based  ethanol  industry  but,  more  importantly,  by  commer-
cializing the production of ethanol from agricultural and municipal waste and
dedicated  energy  crops.  Progress  has  been  made  on  a  process  that  produces
ethanol from biomass using genetically modified biocatalysts and a Canadian
company, Iogen, has just entered commercial production.
• P–Series  fuel  (approved  by  the  Department  of  Energy  in  1999)  is  an  energy-
efficient  blend  of  ethanol,  natural  gas  liquids  and  ether  made  from  biomass
waste.  About  20  percent  of  the  blend  is  MeTHF,  an  ether  derived  from
lignocelullosic biomass—paper sludge, wastepaper, food waste, yard and wood
waste, agricultural waste, and so on. P–Series fuels can help solve a problem
all  municipalities  are  facing  today:  waste  disposal.  Using  feedstock  with  a
negative  cost—that  means  waste  that  municipalities  would  otherwise  pay  to
have  hauled  away—allows  the  fuel’s  selling  price  to  be  about  the  same  as
mid-grade gasoline.
• Methanol  (also  known  as  wood  alcohol)  is  today  for  the  most  part  produced
from  natural  gas.  Expanding  domestic  production  can  be  achieved  by  pro-
ducing methanol from coal, a resource with which the U.S. is abundantly en-
dowed.  The  commercial  feasibility  of  coal-to-methanol  technology  was  dem-
onstrated  as  part  of  the  DOE’s  ‘‘clean  coal’’  technology  effort.  For  almost  a
decade,  a  commercial  scale  demonstration  plant  in  Kingsport,  Tennessee  has
been  producing  methanol  from  coal  at  under  $0.50  a  gallon.  Methanol  can
also be produced from biomass using gasification technology.

Alcohol fuels are relatively easy to introduce to the market because of the low in-
frastructure  costs  involved.  It  only  costs  about  $20,000  to  enable  an  existing  gaso-
line or diesel tank at a gas station to accommodate one of the above fuels and about
$60,000  to  add  a  new  fuel  pump  to  an  existing  refueling  station.  By  introducing  a
fleet  of  FFVs  and  actually  fueling  them  with  blends  of  say  20  percent  alcohol  and
80  percent  gasoline  we  can  save  more  oil  than  through  the  entire  CAFE  program.
For  example,  a  hybrid  car  like  the  Toyota  Prius  that  is  also  an  FFV  running  on  a
blend  of  85  percent  ethanol  and  15  percent  gasoline  can  get  nearly  300  miles  per
gallon of gasoline.
Electricity as a Fuel

Electricity  is  seldom  referred  to  as  a  transportation  fuel,  but  it  is.  Less  than  two
percent  of  U.S.  electricity  is  generated  from  oil,  so  using  electricity  as  a  transpor-
tation  fuel  would  greatly  reduce  dependence  on  imported  petroleum.  Tens  of  thou-
sands  of  hybrid  electric  vehicles  are  already  on  America’s  roads  combining  hybrid
engines powered in an integrated fashion by liquid fuel-powered motors and battery-
powered  ones.  Such  vehicles  increase  gas-consumption  efficiency  by  30–40  percent.
While  hybrids  gather  charge  to  their  batteries  by  capturing  breaking  energy,  their
only  external  source  of  energy  is  liquid  fuel.  ‘‘Plug-in’’  hybrid  electric  vehicles  take
the concept one step further, by allowing us to draw charge not only from the engine
and  captured  braking  energy,  but  also  directly  from  the  electrical  grid  by  being
plugged  into  standard  electric  outlets  when  not  in  use.  They  have  liquid  fuel  tanks
and  internal  combustion  engines,  so  they  do  not  face  the  range  limitation  posed  by
electric-only  cars.  Since  fifty  percent  of  cars  on  the  road  in  the  United  States  are
driven  20  miles  a  day  or  less,  a  plug-in  with  a  20-mile  range  battery  would  reduce

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 13:33 Sep 17, 2005 Jkt 098561 PO 00000 Frm 00107 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\FULL05\020905\98561 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

104

fuel  consumption  by,  on  average,  85  percent.  Plug-in  hybrid  electric  vehicles  can
reach  fuel  economy  levels  of  100  miles  per  gallon  of  gasoline  consumed.  Overall,
plug-ins can reduce gasoline use by 85 percent. This is so dramatic a reduction that
a  plug-in  SUV  actually  would  consume  less  gasoline  than  a  standard  compact  car.
Plug-in hybrid vehicles would be charged at night in home garages—a time-interval
during  which  electric  utilities  have  significant  excess  capacity.  The  Electric  Power
Research  Institute  estimates  that  up  to  30  percent  of  market  penetration  for  plug-
in  hybrid  electric  vehicles  with  20-mile  electric  range  can  be  achieved  without  a
need  to  install  additional  electricity-generating  capacity.  Plug-ins  will  soon  make
their debut. DaimlerChrysler is currently introducing a plug in version of its Sprint-
er  van.  Though  a  plug-in  would  be  initially  more  expensive  up  front  than  an  ordi-
nary  car,  the  total  cost  over  the  life  of  the  vehicle  would  be  less  due  to  lower  oper-
ating  costs  and  gasoline  saving.  As  battery  technologies  improve  the  cost  of  plug-
ins will drop further.

If  a  vehicle  combines  hybrid  technology  with  a  flexible  fuel  internal  combustion
engine,  the  effect  of  next  generation  fuels  can  be  multiplied  with  substantial  fuel
efficiency  gains.  A  plug-in  hybrid  vehicle  that  is  also  a  flexible  fuel  vehicle  can  be
powered  by  blends  of  alcohol  fuels,  gasoline,  and  electricity.  If  fueled  by  a  blend  of
80 percent alcohol, 20 percent gasoline, and electricity, fuel economy could reach 500
miles per gallon of gasoline.

According  to  the  Set  America  Free  Coalition  if  by  2025,  all  cars  on  the  road  are
hybrids  and  half  are  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles,  U.S.  oil  imports  would  drop  by  eight
million  barrels  per  day  (mbd).  Today,  the  United  States  imports  10  mbd  and  it  is
projected  to  import  almost  20  mbd  by  2025.  If  all  of  these  cars  were  also  flexible
fuel vehicles, U.S. oil imports would drop by as much as 12 mbd.
Recommendations for Congress:
Provide incentives to auto manufacturers to produce and consumers to purchase, hy-
brid  vehicles,  plug-in  hybrid  electric  vehicles  and  FFVs  across  all  vehicle  models.
Producing  fuel-efficient,  advanced  technology  vehicles  will  requires  automakers
and  their  suppliers  to  retool  their  factories.  Hybrid  vehicles  rely  on  advanced
equipment  such  as  battery  packs,  electric  motors  and  generators,  and  electronic
power  controllers.  Advanced  diesel  drivetrains  require  sophisticated  fuel  injection
systems, turbochargers and after treatment systems.
Provide incentives for auto manufacturers to increase fuel efficiency of existing, non-
FFV auto models. Many off-the-shelf technologies exist to improve today’s cars, in-
cluding  variable  valve  engine  timing,  continuously  variable  transmissions,  and
lightweight, high strength materials.
Call for substantial incorporation of plug-ins hybrids, standard hybrids, and FFVs
into  federal,  State,  municipal  and  covered  fleets,  and  ensure  that  these  FFVs  are
actually fueled with alcohol blends.
Provide  investment  tax  incentives  for  corporate  fleets  and  taxi  fleets  to  switch  to
plug-ins, hybrids and FFVs.
Encourage gasoline distributors to blend combustion enhancers into the fuel.
Provide incentives for existing fueling stations to install alternative fuel pumps and
mandate that all new gas stations be so equipped with such pumps.
Encourage  new  players,  such  as  utilities,  to  enter  the  transportation  fuel  market.
Utility companies have traditionally viewed themselves as providers of ‘‘power’’ for
lighting  homes  or  powering  computers.  Using  electricity  as  a  fuel  can  allow  them
to  become  key  players  in  the  transportation  energy  sector  and  introduce  much
needed competition in the fuel market.
Provide  incentives  for  the  construction  of  commercial  scale  demonstration  plants  to
produce non-petroleum based liquid fuels from domestic energy resources, particu-
larly from waste. Two billion dollars in federal funding utilizing public-private cost
sharing  partnerships  could  build  roughly  25  demonstration  plants.  Such  program
would spur innovation, development, and demonstration projects aimed at making
non-petroleum fuels cost-effective for consumers while weeding out unfeasible tech-
nologies.
Apply efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks. Most of our effort to improve fuel
efficiency  is  focused  on  light-duty  vehicles.  But  improving  the  fuel  economy  of
heavy-duty  trucks  offers  no  smaller  opportunity  for  oil  savings.  The  heavy-duty
trucks  sector  is  responsible  for  the  consumption  of  close  to  three  million  barrels
per  day  of  oil.  Over  two-thirds  of  this  energy  is  consumed  by  the  heaviest  trucks,
such  as  tractor-trailers  weighing  over  33,000  lbs.  Technology  assessments  by  the
American  Council  for  an  Energy-Efficient  Economy  (ACEEE)  found  that  conven-
tional  technology  improvements  including  enhancements  to  aerodynamics,  weight

reduction,  improved  engine  fuel  injection  and  the  introduction  of  hybrid  gasoline-
electric  or  diesel-electric  drive  trains  can  achieve  truck  fuel-efficiency  advances  of
26  to  70  percent  at  cost-effectiveness.  Congress  should  therefore  begin  to  apply
some  of  the  standards  for  the  small  cars  to  the  larger  vehicle  classes  especially
heavy  trucks  from  8,500  to  10,000  lbs.  Tremendous  amounts  of  fuel  are  used  by
truck  drivers  during  idling.  Drivers  idle  their  trucks  for  days  in  a  row  to  heat  or
cool  their  sleeping  cabin  and  run  electrical  appliances.  This  practice  is  extremely
wasteful since large diesel engines are designed to move heavy loads, not run aux-
iliary  systems.  Idling  can  be  reduced  by  installing  auxiliary  power  units  and  pro-
viding electricity in rest areas.
Invest  in  Public  Education.  Consumers  still  rank  fuel  efficiency  way  below  power,
performance, cost and safety in their car buying considerations. As a result the Na-
tion’s  fuel  efficiency  standards  have  remained  stagnant  while  our  oil  dependence
continues  to  grow.  Barring  a  catastrophic  oil  disruption  this  could  only  change  if
the  public  is  to  become  more  aware  of  the  huge  impact  oil  dependence  has  on  our
national security. Reduction of our oil bill should be viewed by consumers as a pa-
triotic duty, not pure economic calculation. There is clear need for public education
program  to  connect  the  dots  between  our  behavior  on  the  road  and  our  national
security,  between  the  number  of  Hummers  on  the  road  and  the  number  of
Humvees in the Persian Gulf. Another issue on which public education is desirable
is  the  true  cost  of  oil.  The  most  recent  estimates  suggest  that  in  a  non-war  year
the  United  States  spends  $20  to  $40  billion  in  military  costs  to  secure  access  to
Middle  East  oil  supplies,  which  means  that  the  American  taxpayer  is  paying  at
least an additional $4 to $5 a barrel for crude oil above market price. These extra
dollars are being paid by consumers through their income tax but are not reflected
at  the  price  at  the  gas  station.  If  Americans  were  more  aware  of  what  they  pay
outside the gas station it would be politically easier to introduce legislative efforts
to  transfer  that  tax  burden  from  an  indirect  mechanism  such  as  income  tax  to  a
direct pay-as-you-go tax at the pump.
In sum

America  takes  pride  in  offering  choice  in  every  aspect  of  our  lives.  Yet,  when  it
comes  to  transportation  fuels  we  are  offered  nothing  but  petroleum  products.  We
must  embark  on  an  effort  to  diversify  our  fuel  market  by  introducing  domestically
produced fuels that are made from waste products or other resources the U.S. is rich
in,  and  that  are  clean  and  affordable.  The  U.S.  is  no  longer  rich  in  oil  or  natural
gas.  It  has,  however,  a  wealth  of  other  energy  sources  from  which  transportation
fuel can be safely, affordably and cleanly generated. Among them: hundreds of years
worth of coal reserves, 25 percent of the world’s total (especially promising with In-
tegrated  Gasification  and  Combined  Cycle  technologies);  billions  of  tons  a  year  of
biomass,  and  further  billions  of  tons  of  agricultural  and  municipal  waste.  Vehicles
that  meet  consumer  needs  like  ‘‘plug-in’’  hybrids  can  tap  America’s  electrical  grid
to supply energy for transportation, making more efficient use of such clean sources
of electricity as solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric and nuclear power.

Because of the national security imperative we have no time to wait for commer-
cialization of immature technologies such as fuel cells. I believe that automotive fuel
cells  hold  great  potential  and  should  definitely  be  pursued.  But  far  too  much  focus
is  being  placed  on  them  at  the  expense  of  more  quickly  available  solutions.  We
should  focus  on  real  world  solutions  and  implement  technologies  that  exist  today
and  are  ready  for  widespread  use.  We  also  don’t  have  the  time  and  money  to  em-
bark  on  massive  infrastructure  changes.  The  focus  should  be  on  utilizing  competi-
tive  technologies  that  do  not  require  prohibitive  or,  if  possible,  even  significant  in-
vestment  in  changing  our  transportation  sector’s  infrastructure.  Instead,  we  should
permit  the  maximum  possible  use  of  the  existing  refueling  and  automotive  infra-
structure. Finally, we need to remember that oil dependence is a global issue which
should  be  addressed  internationally.  Even  if  the  U.S.  was  no  longer  dependent  on
foreign  oil,  if  the  rest  of  the  world  still  remains  beholden  to  the  small  club  of  oil
producers  the  national  security  problems  discussed  before  will  not  go  away.  Only  a
global  effort  led  by  the  U.S.  to  reduce  demand  for  petroleum  by  distributing  the
above-mentioned  technologies  will  bring  about  prosperity  and  strengthen  global  se-
curity.
