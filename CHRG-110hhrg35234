Purpose

On Tuesday, May 15, 2007 the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the
Committee  on  Science  and  Technology  will  hold  a  hearing  to  receive  testimony  on
the  advancement  of  coal  technologies  and  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  strate-
gies which will help to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, in particular, car-
bon dioxide.

The  Department  of  Energy  has  a  number  of  ongoing  research  and  development
programs  designed  to  demonstrate  advanced  technologies  that  reduce  coal  power’s
carbon  emissions.  In  addition,  some  industry  leaders  also  have  begun  to  invest  in
advanced coal technologies. The Committee will hear testimony from five witnesses
who  will  speak  to  the  current  research,  development,  demonstration  and  ultimate
commercial application of technologies that enable our power plants to operate more
efficiently,  reduce  emissions,  and  capture  carbon  for  long-term  storage.  They  will
discuss  the  technological  and  economic  challenges  we  face  in  limiting  carbon  emis-
sions and safely managing the captured carbon on a large scale.

Background

Approximately 50 percent of the electricity generated in the United States is from
coal.  According  to  DOE’s  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA)  carbon  dioxide
emissions  in  the  United  States  and  its  territories  were  6,008.6  million  metric  tons
(MMT)  in  2005.  In  the  United  States,  most  CO2 is  emitted  as  a  result  of  the  com-
bustion of fossil fuels. In particular, the electric power sector accounts for 40 percent
of the CO2 emissions in the U.S., according to EIA.

If  we  are  going  to  implement  policies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associ-
ated  with  the  use  of  coal,  what  technologies  are  currently  available,  what  tech-
nologies  need  to  be  developed  or  improved,  and  what  technical  challenges  must  we
overcome  to  meet  that  goal?  There  are  two  primary  approaches  to  reducing  emis-
sions  associated  with  coal-fired  power  production:  increasing  the  efficiency  of  coal-
fired  plants  (through  replacement  with  new  plants  or  retrofitting  existing  plants)
and  through  installation  of  carbon  capture  technology  and  transporting  CO2 to  a
permanent storage facility.
CO2 Capture

Retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants to capture carbon is a critical compo-
nent  of  any  strategy  to  reduce  our  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  Carbon  capture
applications may be installed in new energy plants or retrofitted to existing plants.
Some  outstanding  issues  with  retrofitting  existing  plants  include  site  constraints
such  as  availability  of  land  for  the  capture  equipment  and  the  need  for  a  long  re-
maining  plant  life  to  justify  the  large  expense  of  installing  the  capture  equipment.
Another  potential  barrier  to  retrofitting  is  the  loss  in  efficiency  that  can  occur  due
to the energy required to operate the carbon-capture equipment.

The  first  step  in  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  is  to  produce  a  concentrated
stream  of  CO2 for  capture.  Currently,  there  are  three  main  approaches  to  capture
CO2 from  large-scale  industrial  facilities  or  power  plants:  1)  post-combustion  cap-
ture, 2) pre-combustion capture, and 3) oxy-fuel combustion capture.

Post-combustion  capture  process,  although  not  required,  involves  extracting  CO2
from the flue gas following combustion of fossil fuels. There are commercially avail-
able technologies that use chemical solvents to absorb the carbon.

Pre-combustion capture separates CO2 from the fuel by combining it with air and/
or  steam  to  produce  hydrogen  for  combustion  and  CO2 for  storage.  The  most  com-
monly discussed type of pre-combustion capture technology is the gasification meth-
od. Gasification is a method of taking low-value feedstocks such as coal, biomass or
petroleum  coke  and  transforming  them  through  a  chemical  process  to  make  high
value  products  such  as  chemicals  or  electricity.  Integrated  Gasification  Combined
Cycle  (IGCC)—often  discussed  as  a  major  breakthrough  to  improve  the  environ-
mental  performance  of  coal-based  electric  power  generation—is  a  form  of  gasifi-
cation,  which  uses  syngas  created  from  the  gasification  process  as  the  feedstock,  to
power  a  combined-cycle  turbine  used  to  produce  electricity.  IGCC  has  the  ability  to
produce a relatively pure stream of CO2 arguably making it better suited for carbon
capture than a pulverized coal plant.

Oxy-fuel  combustion  capture  uses  oxygen  instead  of  air  for  combustion  and  pro-
duces a flue gas that is mostly CO2 and water which are easily separated. This tech-
nique  is  considered  developmental  and  has  not  been  widely  applied  for  power  pro-
duction,  mainly  because  the  temperatures  that  result  from  the  combustion  of  pure
oxygen are far too high for typical power plant materials.
CO2 Sequestration

Geologic  sequestration  of  CO2 is  considered  the  most  feasible  and  widely  studied
method of storage. There are three main types of geologic formations: 1) oil and gas
reservoirs, 2) deep saline reservoirs, and 3) unmineable coal seams.

When  CO2 is  injected  below  800  meters  in  a  typical  reservoir,  the  pressure  in-
duces  CO2 to  behave  like  a  relatively  dense  liquid.  This  state  is  known  as  ‘‘super-
critical.’’  With  each  of  the  three  methods  listed  above,  CO2 would  be  injected  into
reservoirs  that  hold,  or  previously  held  liquids  or  gases.  In  addition,  injecting  CO2
into  deep  geological  formations  uses  existing  technologies  that  have  been  primarily
developed  by  and  used  for  the  oil  and  gas  industry.  For  these  reasons,  geologic  se-
questration appears to be a promising carbon storage strategy.

Pumping CO2 into oil and gas reservoirs to boost production, a process known as
enhanced  oil  recovery  (EOR)  is  practiced  by  the  petroleum  industry  today.  Using

5

EOR for long-term CO2 storage is beneficial because sequestration costs can be par-
tially offset by revenues from oil and gas production. However, the primary purpose
of  CO2 for  EOR  was  not  intended  to  serve  the  need  for  long-term  sequestration  of
CO2 and  the  degree  to  which  injected  CO2 remains  in  the  reservoir  in  many  areas
utilizing EOR is unknown.

Depleted or abandoned oil and gas fields are potential candidates for CO2 storage
because the oil and gas originally trapped did not escape for millions of years dem-
onstrating  the  structural  integrity  of  these  reservoirs.  Because  of  their  value  as
sources of oil and gas, these reservoirs have been mapped and studied and computer
models have often been developed to understand how hydrocarbons move in the res-
ervoir.  These  models  could  be  applied  to  predict  the  potential  movement  of  CO2
within these reservoirs.

Still,  there  are  concerns  with  using  oil  and  gas  reservoirs  for  CO2 storage  that
stem  from  the  stability  of  the  reservoir  post-production  and  the  degree  of  certainty
that leakage could be prevented.

A  noteworthy  project  is  the  Weyburn  Project  in  south-central  Canada  which  uses
CO2 produced  from  a  coal  gasification  plant  in  North  Dakota  for  EOR.  According
to CRS, comprehensive monitoring is being conducted at Weyburn.

Deep  saline  formations  are  sedimentary  basins  saturated  with  saline  or  briny
water that is unfit for human consumption or agricultural use. As with oil and gas,
deep  saline  reservoirs  can  be  found  onshore  and  offshore.  There  are  advantages  of
using saline reservoirs for CO2 sequestration: they are more widespread in the U.S.
than oil and gas reservoirs and potentially have the largest reservoir capacity of the
three types of geologic formations being considered for carbon sequestration.

The  first  commercial-scale  operation  for  sequestering  CO2 in  a  deep  saline  res-
ervoir  is  the  Sleipner  Project  in  the  North  Sea.  While  deep  saline  reservoirs  have
huge  potential  capacity  to  store  CO2,  there  is  concern  about  maintaining  the  integ-
rity  of  the  reservoir  because  of  chemical  reactions  following  CO2 injection.  CO2 can
acidify  the  fluids  in  the  reservoir,  dissolving  minerals  such  as  calcium  carbonate,
and  possibly  weakening  the  reliability  of  the  storage  site.  Increased  permeability
could  allow  the  CO2 to  create  new  pathways  that  lead  to  contamination  of  aquifers
used for drinking water.

Many  coal  seams  are  unmineable  with  current  technology  because  the  coal  beds
are  not  thick  enough,  the  beds  are  too  deep,  or  the  structural  integrity  of  the  coal
bed  is  inadequate  for  mining.  Because  coal  beds  are  highly  permeable  they  tend  to
trap gases, such as methane, that bind themselves to the coal. CO2 binds even more
tightly  to  coal  than  methane,  thus  making  it  possible  to  store  the  unwanted  CO2
and increase the recovery of the valuable coalbed methane.
Efficient  Energy  Production  and  Retrofitting  Existing  Coal-fired  Power

Plants

EIA  projections  show  that  a  two  percent  increase  in  coal  efficiency  would  exceed
all  additional  renewable  power  generation  through  the  EIA  forecast  period  (2030).
Raising the efficiency of power plants is part of the debate on how best to reduce
carbon  dioxide  emissions.  Adopting  advanced  power  generating  systems  could  help
plant efficiency for coal-fired power plants. For example, the Department of Energy’s
National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is developing technologies to ensure
existing  and  future  coal  power  systems  are  more  efficient  and  burn  more  cleanly.
Their work includes gasification, advanced combustion, and turbine and heat engine
technologies.  Coal  power  plants  operate  at  approximately  a  33  percent  efficiency
level  and  NETL  is  striving  to  develop  technologies  for  a  central  power  plant  that
is capable of 60 percent efficiency with near zero emissions by 2020.

In  addition  to  designing  new  plants  to  be  more  efficient,  NETL  and  others  are
working  on  technologies  that  can  be  utilized  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  existing
coal-fired power plants. In the short-term, options such as converting from sub-crit-
ical  to  super-critical  steam  cycle  and  combining  coal  with  biomass  to  fuel  plants
both offer opportunities to lower CO2 emissions from existing coal plants.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  This  hearing  will  come  to  order,  and  I  am
pleased to welcome our witnesses here today to talk about a critical
issue:  the  advancing  technologies  designed  to  reduce  coal  power’s
carbon dioxide emissions.

I  think  our  panelists  will  bring  a  wealth  of  knowledge  to  share
about  cleaner  production  of  electricity  at  both  new  and  existing
coal-fired  power  plants,  and  we  have  several  witnesses  who  will
discuss  the  technical  issues  regarding  long-term  geological  storage
of  CO2.  Again,  I  welcome  our  witnesses  and  thank  you  very  much
for testifying before the Subcommittee this afternoon.

As  many  of  us  know  in  this  room  this  afternoon,  approximately
50 percent of the electricity generated in the United States is from
coal.  According  to  DOE’s  Energy  Information  Administration,  EIA,
carbon  dioxide  emissions  in  the  United  States  and  its  territories
were  just  over  six  billion  metric  tons  in  2005,  and  the  electric
power  sector  generates  approximately  40  percent  of  the  Nation’s
CO2 emissions.

Because  we  will  continue  to  rely  on  coal  for  a  large  percentage
of our energy consumption for the foreseeable future, there is grow-
ing  national  and  global  interest  in  developing  strategies  to  signifi-
cantly reduce the billions of tons of carbon dioxide released into our
atmosphere from this source.

If  we  are  going  to  implement  policies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas
emissions associated with the use of coal, today’s hearing will help
us  better  understand  how  far  along  we  have  come  in  meeting  this
challenge and how much further we may need to go.

I  understand  that  promising  technologies  are  being  developed  to
improve the efficient production of electricity from coal-fired power
plants which could help to reduce CO2 emissions. I look forward to
learning  more  about  the  deployment  of  technologies  that  can  cap-
ture  CO2 from  new  and  existing  power  plants  and  keep  it  out  of
the atmosphere.

We  must  advance  our  technical  ability  to  capture  CO2 and  pre-
pare the heat-trapping gas for safe and effective storage in geologic
formations.  Without  commercialization  of  carbon  capture  tech-
nologies and effective strategies to transport the CO2 from capture
to  long-term  storage,  we  run  the  risk  of  profound  damages  to  our
climate system.

I believe that coal will continue to remain a major energy source
in the United States. I also believe the government, in partnership
with private industry and universities, can take great strides in re-
ducing coal’s contribution to global warming.

I look forward to hearing from our panelists about the challenges
we face to design a carbon capture and sequestration strategy that
is sensible and meaningful.

And  now,  I  would  like  to  recognize  our  distinguished  Ranking
Member,  Mr.  Inglis  of  South  Carolina,  for  his  opening  statement.

[The prepared statement of Chairman Lampson follows:]

fore the Subcommittee this afternoon.

As many of us in this room know, approximately 50 percent of the electricity gen-
erated  in  the  United  States  is  from  coal.  According  to  DOE’s  Energy  Information
Administration  (EIA)  carbon  dioxide  emissions  in  the  United  States  and  its  terri-
tories  were  just  over  six  billion  metric  tons  in  2005,  and  the  electric  power  sector
generates approximately 40 percent of the Nation’s CO2 emissions.

Because  we  will  continue  to  rely  on  coal  for  a  large  percent  of  our  energy  con-
sumption  for  the  foreseeable  future,  there  is  a  growing  national  and  global  interest
in developing strategies to reduce significantly the billions of tons of carbon dioxide
released into our atmosphere from this source.

If  we  are  going  to  implement  policies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  associ-
ated  with  the  use  of  coal,  today’s  hearing  will  help  us  better  understand  how  far
along  we  have  come  in  meeting  this  challenge  and  how  much  further  we  may  need
to go.

I understand that promising technologies are being developed to improve the effi-
cient  production  of  electricity  from  coal-fired  power  plants  which  could  help  to  re-
duce  CO2 emissions.  I  look  forward  to  learning  more  about  the  deployment  of  tech-
nologies  that  can  capture  CO2 from  new  and  existing  power  plants  and  keep  it  out
of the atmosphere.

We must advance our technical ability to capture CO2 and prepare the heat-trap-
ping  gas  for  safe  and  effective  storage  in  geologic  formations.  Without  commer-
cialization  of  carbon  capture  technologies  and  effective  strategies  to  transport  the
CO2 from capture to long-term storage, we run the risk of profound damages to our
climate system.

I  believe  that  coal  will  continue  to  remain  a  major  energy  source  in  the  United
States. I also believe the government, in partnership with private industry and uni-
versities,  can  take  great  strides  in  reducing  coal’s  contribution  to  global  warming.
I  look  forward  to  hearing  from  our  panelists  about  the  challenges  we  face  to  de-
sign  a  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  strategy  that  is  sensible  and  meaningful.
Mr.  INGLIS.  And  I  thank  the  Chairman.  Thank  you  for  holding

this hearing on an important topic.

As  the  Chairman  just  pointed  out,  we  get  a  lot  of  our  electricity
from  coal,  and  we  have  a  lot  of  coal  available  to  us,  so  sequestra-
tion  seems  to  be  one  of  the  key  breakthroughs  that  we  need  to
achieve  in  order  to  make  efficient  or  effective  use  of  this  resource.
And you know, we have got a case study in South Carolina right
now.  Duke  Energy  faces  a  decision  of  whether  to  build  a  coal-fired
plant  or  a  nuclear  power  plant,  the  question  of  the  nuclear  plant,
I think that it would be preferable, frankly, in that situation, even
though  it  is  very  expensive,  $6  billion.  But  their  probable  choice,
sounds  to  me,  since  I  am  not  connected  with  the  company,  I  guess
we  don’t  have  to  make  any  SEC  disclosures  based  on  this,  but  it
seems  to  me  that  they  are  probably  headed  toward  the  coal-fired
plant,  which  will,  24/7,  365  days  a  year,  have  a  CO2 issue  associ-
ated  with  it.  And  somehow,  we  have  got  to  deal  with  that,  and  so,
this  panel  today,  I  hope,  will  help  us  figure  out  where  the  science
stands  with  respect  to  sequestration,  and  help  us  know  how  the
government  might  be  a  partner  in  funding  some  research,  or  in
being  the  early  adopters  or  the  regulators  that  would  cause  this
technology to advance, and make it so that that plant, if it is built
as  a  coal  plant,  doesn’t  create  the  harmful  side  effects  that  we  are
all concerned about.

So,  it  is  good  to  be  here.  It  is  good  to  have  the  opportunity  to
have  some  experts  that  will  help  us  understand  the  possibilities
that are available to us, and Mr. Chairman, I look forward to hear-
ing from our witnesses.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE BOB INGLIS

Thank you for holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman.
Duke Energy faces a dilemma in South Carolina. They would like to be producing
energy  free  of  CO2 emissions,  but  because  of  the  extensive  licensing  hurdles  of  nu-
clear,  and  the  high  costs  of  wind  and  solar  power,  Duke  has  been  forced  to  meet
increased  energy  demand  by  building  coal-powered  plants.  Perhaps  if  we  had  clean
coal  and  carbon  capture  technologies  readily  available  and  affordable,  companies
like  Duke  would  be  able  to  meet  growing  energy  demand  with  coal  and  without
emissions.

We  are  currently  consuming  coal  energy  at  a  rapid  pace.  We  need  to  focus  on
ways  to  make  that  consumption  cleaner  and  more  efficient.  Clean  coal  and  carbon
capture and sequestration technologies offer such solutions. I hope that we can find
ways to encourage the implementation of these technologies.

More importantly, I hope that these technologies will be affordable and attractive
to U.S. and global industry alike. America can lead the way with technological inno-
vation that can be easily integrated into existing coal plants worldwide. In addition,
the  research  that  will  soon  begin  at  the  FutureGen  site,  and  the  construction  of
IGCC  power  plants,  will  be  vital  for  pioneering  and  demonstrating  the  many  bene-
fits  of  clean  coal  and  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  technologies  for  other  coun-
tries.

The future of renewable energy promises an end to our dependence on fossil fuels
like oil and coal. But for today, we must work to make sure that our coal consump-
tion  is  as  emission-free  and  energy  efficient  as  possible,  bringing  benefits  to  both
industry and the environment.

Thank  you  again  for  holding  this  hearing,  Mr.  Chairman,  and  I  look  forward  to

hearing from our witnesses.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  ask  unanimous
consent  that  all  additional  opening  statements  submitted  by  Sub-
committee  Members  be  included  in  the  record.  Without  objection,
so ordered.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Costello follows:]

PREPARED STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE JERRY F. COSTELLO

Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  for  calling  today’s  hearing  to  receive  testimony  on  the
advancement  of  coal  technologies  and  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  strategies.
I  am  privileged  to  represent  the  12th  Congressional  District  of  Illinois,  a  region
rich  in  coal  reserves  and  mining.  Coal  plays  a  vital  role  as  an  energy  source,  and
the industries involved in the mining, transportation and utilization of coal provide
thousands  of  jobs  for  people  in  Illinois  and  other  parts  of  the  country,  in  addition
to  economic  benefits  to  many  communities  across  Illinois  and  the  Nation.  Further,
the  Clean  Coal  Research  Center  at  Southern  Illinois  University  (SIUC),  the  State
of  Illinois  and  its  energy  industries  are  committed  to  the  development  and  applica-
tion of technologies for the environmentally sound use of Illinois coal.

I  believe  clean  coal  technology  is  part  of  the  solution  to  achieving  U.S.  energy
independence, continued economic prosperity and improved environmental steward-
ship.  In  February,  a  group  of  twenty-seven  Democrats  sent  a  letter  to  Speaker
Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer stating our strong commitment to advance the de-
ployment  of  clean  coal  technologies,  including  carbon  capture  and  sequestration
(CCS). In order for carbon capture and sequestration technology to become commer-
cially  viable,  the  Federal  Government  must  show  it  is  committed  to  the  necessary
research,  development,  and  demonstration  (RD&D).  Mr.  Chairman,  as  you  know,  I
have been a strong advocate for federal coal initiatives and programs. I am focused
on increasing the funding levels for clean coal research and development (R&D) pro-
grams  for  FY08  because  coal  is  going  to  be  the  mainstay  for  electricity  generation
well  into  the  future.  I  intend  to  continue  to  work  with  my  colleagues  on  both  sides
of the aisle to ensure we continue to advance clean coal technology to overcome the
technical and economical challenges for coal-based power plants.

There have been several Committee hearings in the House and Senate to discuss
CCS  technology.  I  am  glad  we  are  having  today’s  Subcommittee  hearing  because  it
is  important  to  clarify  that  while  CCS  technology  will  enable  our  power  plants  to
operate more efficiently and reduce emissions, there are challenges to overcome be-
fore the utilities or the coal industry can deploy CCS technology. The reality is that
until CCS technology is ready to be deployed at a commercial scale, a mandate from
Congress  requiring  industry  to  cap  all  carbon  dioxide  underground  will  shut  down
coal  plants  across  the  country,  drive  up  consumer’s  electricity  bills,  and  convert

power generation plants to burn natural gas. Given the volatility of the oil and gas
market,  the  instability  in  the  Middle  East  and  rising  oil  and  gas  prices,  we  should
be  moving  away  from  policies  that  place  a  greater  dependence  on  foreign  resources
and  instead,  focus  on  improving  clean  coal  R&D  and  demonstration  projects  to  uti-
lize the natural resources we have here in the U.S. I am interested in hearing from
our witnesses further on this point.

With  that,  again,  thank  you  Chairman  Lampson—I  look  forward  to  hearing  from

our witnesses.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  It  is  my  pleasure  to  introduce  the  excellent
panel  of  witnesses  that  we  have  here  with  us  this  afternoon.  Mr.
Carl Bauer is the Director of the National Energy Technology Lab-
oratory at the Department of Energy. He is accompanied by Dr. Jo-
seph  Strakey,  who  leads  the  Strategic  Center  for  Coal  at  the  Lab-
oratory.

Mr.  Michael  Rencheck  is  the  Senior  Vice  President  of  Engineer-
ing  Projects  and  Field  Services  for  American  Electric  Power.  Mr.
Stuart  Dalton  is  the  Director  of  Generation  at  the  Electric  Power
Research  Institute,  and  Mr.  Gardiner  Hill  is  the  Director  of  the
CCS Technology and Alternative Energy for British Petroleum.

And at this time, I would yield to my colleague from Illinois, Mr.

Costello, to introduce our fifth witness, Dr. Robert Finley.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  you,  and  I  thank  you  for

calling this hearing today on this important topic.

Dr. Robert Finley is the Director of Energy and Earth Resources
Center  for  the  Illinois  State  Geological  Survey.  Dr.  Finley  is  the
head of a Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership in the Illinois
Basin  aimed  at  addressing  concerns  with  geological  carbon  man-
agement.  We  look  forward  to  hearing  from  him  today,  as  well  as
the  other  witnesses,  and  I  might  add  that  we  have  had  the  oppor-
tunity  to  discuss  this  important  issue  with  Dr.  Finley  in  the  past,
and we look forward to hearing his testimony and the testimony of
the other witnesses.

I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Costello.
You will each have five minutes for your spoken testimony. Your
full  written  testimony  will  be  included  in  the  record  for  the  hear-
ing,  and  when  each  of  you  has  completed  your  testimony,  we  will
begin  with  questions,  and  each  Member  will  have  five  minutes  to

Mr. Bauer, would you begin, please.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  CARL  O.  BAUER,  DIRECTOR,  NATIONAL
ENERGY  TECHNOLOGY  LABORATORY,  U.S.  DEPARTMENT  OF
ENERGY
Mr. BAUER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Com-
mittee. I appreciate this opportunity to provide testimony on DOE’s
advanced  clean  coal  technologies  and  the  program  for  carbon  cap-
ture and storage.

Our economic prosperity was built upon abundance of fossil fuels,
and we have approximately a 250 year supply of coal in the United
States.  The  continued  use  of  this  secure  domestic  resource  is  criti-
cally  dependent  on  developing  cost-effective  technology  options  to
meet our environmental goals, including the reduction of carbon di-
oxide.

Carbon  capture  and  storage,  or  CCS,  offers  a  great  opportunity
to  reduce  these  potential  emissions,  and  the  U.S.  and  Canada  are
blessed with an abundance of potential geologic storage capacity for
CO2. The current facts store annual CO2 emissions associated with
all  current  energy  production  and  use  in  North  America  for  a  pe-
riod of about 500 years.

Our  coal  technology  program  includes  development  of  advanced
technologies  for  pre-combustion  or  gasification,  post-combustion,
and  oxy-combustion,  multiple  pathways  to  produce  power  and  cap-
ture  CO2,  as  well  as  a  robust  program  for  carbon  sequestration.
The  2012  program  goal  is  to  show  that  we  can  develop  advanced
technology to capture and store at least 90 percent of the potential
CO2 emissions  from  coal-fired  power  plants,  with  less  than  a  10
percent  increase  in  the  cost  of  electricity.  Commercially  available
technology to do this today would add from 30 to 70 percent to the
present price of electricity.

Gasification is a pre-combustion pathway to convert coal biomass
or  carbon  containing  feedstocks  into  clean  synthesis  gas  for  use  in
producing  power,  fuel,  chemicals,  and  hydrogen.  The  gasification
technologies  being  developed  meet  the  most  stringent  environ-
mental regulations in any state and provide the opportunity for po-
tential efficient capture of CO2.

The Power System Development Facility in Wilsonville, Alabama
provides  a  pilot-scale  test  platform  for  evaluating  critical  process
components.  The  transport  gasifier  at  the  PSDF  is  showing  great
promise  for  cost-effective  gasification  of  low-rank,  high-moisture
western coals. Recent successful testing of the Stamet dry-feed coal
pump  indicates  a  breakthrough,  allowing  coal  to  be  pumped  di-
rectly into a high-pressure gasifier, and thus avoiding the need for
coal drying and complex feeding systems.

Another major development is the ion transport membrane tech-
nology. This is a more efficient and lower cost method for producing
oxygen which is needed for these processes. This year, we are test-
ing  the  robustness  of  the  technology  at  Air  Products’  Sparrows
Point facility.

Finally,  we  are  successfully  testing  at  Research  Triangle  Insti-
tute’s  warm  gas  sulfur  cleanup  system  at  Eastman  Chemical’s  fa-
cility in Kingsport, Tennessee. They have a gasifier there that uses
coal.  Since  last  fall,  the  test  unit  has  performed  exceptionally  well
and achieved extremely low sulfur levels.

The  Advanced  Turbine  Program  is  developing  and  testing  ad-
vanced  turbine  technologies  for  use  of  hydrogen  as  a  fuel.  A  key
need for zero-emission coal gasification plants. We plan to increase
the  efficiency  of  these  turbines  by  two  to  three  percentage  points,
while  reducing  the  nitrous  oxide  emissions  to  ultra-low  t  parts  per
million. High temperature solid oxide fuel cells are being developed
for  a  variety  of  applications  under  the  SECA  program.  These  fuel
cells  offer  several  significant  advantages  to  coal-based  near-zero-
emissions  power  systems,  and  are  focused  on  operating  on  coal-de-
rived syngas.

DOE’s carbon sequestration program leverages basic and applied
research with field verification to assess the technical and economic
viability  of  CCS.  The  key  challenges  for  this  program  are  to  dem-
onstrate  the  ability  to  capture  and  store  CO2 in  underground  geo-

logic  formations  with  long-term  stability,  develop  the  ability  to
monitor and verify the fate of the CO2, and to gain public and regu-
latory  acceptance.  DOE’s  seven  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration
Partnerships are engaged in a major effort to develop and validate
the CCS technology in different geologies across the U.S.

DOE  also  recognizes  the  importance  of  the  existing  fleet  of  coal-
fired  power  plants  in  meeting  energy  demand  and  possible  future
carbon  constraints.  Research  is  being  pursued  to  dramatically
lower the cost of capturing CO2 from these plants.

The  FutureGen  project  is  an  industry/government  partnership
designed to build and operate a gasification-based, nearly emission-
free, coal-fired electricity production plant. The 275-megawatt plant
will serve as a large-scale laboratory for the validating of the com-
mercial  readiness  of  the  technologies  that  are  emerging  from  the
base  coal  R&D  pipeline.  The  important  data  and  experience  from
FutureGen  will  lead  to  design  of  the  next  generation  of  near-zero-
emission  coal  plants,  and  provide  information  for  industry,  finan-
cial investors, and regulatory partners to understand how better to
regulate and operate these plants.

Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  this  completes
my  statement,  and  I  would  be  happy  to  take  any  questions  you
may have at this time or later. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Bauer follows:]
PREPARED STATEMENT OF CARL O. BAUER

Thank you Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I appreciate this oppor-
tunity to provide testimony on the Department of Energy’s advanced clean coal tech-
nologies and the program for carbon capture and storage.

The economic prosperity of the United States over the past century has been built
upon an abundance of fossil fuels in North America. We have approximately a 250-
year supply of coal available in the United States, at our current consumption rates.
Coal-fired  power  plants  supply  over  half  of  our  electricity  today;  the  continued  use
of  this  secure  domestic  resource  is  critically  dependent  on  the  development  of  cost-
effective  technology  options  to  meet  our  environmental  goals,  including  the  reduc-
tion of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies offer a great opportunity to reduce
these  potential  emissions.  Fortunately,  the  United  States  and  Canada  are  blessed
with an abundance of potential geologic storage capacity. At the current rate of en-
ergy  production  and  use,  we  could  potentially  store  all  of  the  associated  CO2 emis-
sions in North America that are produced over the next 175 to 500 years, according
to the geologic storage capacity estimates recently made by DOE’s Regional Carbon
Sequestration  Partnerships.  These  results  were  recently  published  in  the  ‘‘Carbon
Sequestration  Atlas  of  the  United  States  and  Canada’’  that  is  available  on  our
website at http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/carbon¥seq/refshelf.html.

The  two  greatest  challenges  facing  technology  development  for  clean  power  pro-
duction  integrated  with  CCS  are  reducing  the  cost  of  carbon  capture  and  proving
the  safety  and  efficiency  of  long-term  geologic  storage  of  CO2.  DOE  supports  a  ro-
bust RD&D program specifically designed to address these challenges. The Office of
Fossil Energy’s core Coal Technology Program includes the development of advanced
technologies  for  pre-combustion  (or  gasification),  post-combustion,  and  oxy-combus-
tion—multiple  pathways  to  produce  power  and  capture  CO2—as  well  as  a  robust
program  for  carbon  sequestration  to  prove  the  viability  of  long-term  geologic  and
terrestrial  storage.  DOE’s  Office  of  Science  also  supports  basic  research  in  areas
such  as  combustion  chemistry,  fundamentally  new  materials,  and  modeling  of  com-
bustion reactions that underpin the development of potential future clean coal tech-
nologies,  and  basic  research  towards  improving  our  scientific  understanding  of  the
behavior of CO2 at potential geological sites.

The  2012  goal  of  the  Coal  Technology  Program  is  to  show  that  we  can  develop
advanced  technology  to  capture  and  store  at  least  90  percent  of  the  potential  CO2
emissions  from  coal-fired  power  plants,  with  less  than  a  10  percent  increase  in  the
cost  of  electricity.  This  is  an  ambitious  and  significant  goal,  considering  that  com-

12

mercially available technology to do this today will add from 30 to 70 percent to the
cost of electricity.

Based  on  the  Energy  Information  Administration’s  2007  new  capacity  forecast,
145  gigawatts  of  new  coal-based  capacity  will  be  required  in  the  United  States  by
2030,  while  still  maintaining  most  of  the  300  gigawatts  of  generating  capacity  in
the  existing  coal  fleet.  We  have  a  fast-approaching  opportunity  to  introduce  a  ‘‘new
breed’’  of  power  plant—one  that  is  highly  efficient,  capable  of  producing  multiple
products, and is virtually pollution-free (‘‘near-zero’’ emissions, including carbon). In
addition to technology for new plants, we are also likely to need technology that will
permit  efficient,  cost-effective  capture  of  CO2 emissions  from  the  existing  fleet.
DOE’s  R&D  program  is  aimed  at  providing  the  scientific  and  technological  founda-
tion  for  carbon  capture  and  storage  for  both  new  and  existing  coal-fueled  power
plants.

Gasification  is  a  pre-combustion  pathway  to  convert  coal  or  other  carbon-con-
taining feedstocks into synthesis gas, a mixture composed primarily of carbon mon-
oxide  and  hydrogen,  which  can  be  used  as  a  fuel  to  generate  electricity  or  steam,
or  as  a  basic  raw  material  to  produce  hydrogen,  high-value  chemicals,  and  liquid
transportation  fuels.  We  are  developing  advanced  gasification  technology  to  meet
the most stringent environmental regulations in any state and facilitate the efficient
capture  of  CO2 for  subsequent  sequestration—a  pathway  to  ‘‘near-zero-emission’’
coal-based energy.

The  portfolio  of  gasification  projects  that  we  are  developing  in  partnership  with
industry covers a broad range of approaches. I’d like to highlight some of the impor-
tant recent developments.

The  Power  Systems  Development  Facility  (PSDF)  in  Wilsonville,  Alabama,  oper-
ated  by  the  Southern  Company  for  DOE,  provides  a  pilot-scale  test  platform  for
evaluating  components  critical  to  the  evolution  of  gasification  technology.  The
‘‘transport gasifier’’ under development at the PSDF is proving to be very promising
in terms of efficiency and cost, especially for gasifying low-rank, high-moisture west-
ern coals. Data from this facility is providing the design basis for scaling technology
components to full-size in support of near-zero-emission coal systems.

The Stamet dry-feed coal pump is another promising gasification sub-system that
we have been sponsoring. It allows coal to be ‘‘pumped’’ directly into a high-pressure
gasifier, thus avoiding the need for coal drying and a complex and costly lock hopper
feeding  system—or,  alternatively,  a  slurry  feeding  system  that  is  inefficient  when
used  to  feed  high-moisture  western  coals.  We  have  tested  the  system  successfully
at the PSDF, and in recent tests at Stamet’s facilities in California where operation
was successfully demonstrated at conditions typical of high-pressure gasifiers.

Another  major  program  objective  is  the  development  of  ion  transport  membrane
(ITM)  technology,  an  alternative  to  conventional  cryogenic  methods  for  oxygen  pro-
duction that promises capital cost reductions of $130 per kilowatt, and efficiency im-
provements of about one percent when integrated into oxygen-based gasification sys-
tems. This year we will test the robustness of the membranes under various process
conditions  and  upsets  in  a  five-ton-per-day  unit  that  is  operating  at  Air  Products
and Chemicals, Inc.’s, Sparrows Point industrial gas facility located near Baltimore,
Maryland.  The  information  generated  from  this  small  unit  will  be  used  to  design
and test a 150-ton-per-day facility that will pave the way for a full-scale commercial
unit in the Department’s FutureGen Project, discussed further below.

Finally,  we  have  been  successfully  testing  the  Research  Triangle  Institute’s
(RTI’s)  warm  gas  sulfur  cleanup  system  at  Eastman  Chemical’s  Kingsport,  Ten-
nessee, chemical complex where a small syngas slipstream is taken from commercial
coal  gasifiers  and  processed  in  a  transport  desulfurization  unit.  Since  last  fall—in
over 2,000 hours of operation—the unit has performed exceptionally well, achieving
extremely low sulfur levels compared to existing commercial technologies. This new
technology  offers  potential  for  capital  cost  reductions  of  $250  per  kilowatt  and  effi-
ciency improvements of three to four percent. We are currently in negotiations with
RTI  to  scale  up  this  technology  for  testing  at  a  commercial  Integrated  Gasification
Combined Cycle (IGCC) facility.

The Advanced Turbine Program is leveraging the knowledge gained from previous
turbine  R&D  activities  to  make  unprecedented  gains  in  state-of-the-art  turbine  de-
signs.  Potential  pathways  to  advanced  turbine  designs  for  high-hydrogen  fuels  in-
clude  increasing  turbine  inlet  temperatures,  developing  advanced  combustor  de-
signs,  increasing  compression  ratios,  and  integrating  air  separation  and  CO2 com-
pression.

For  near-zero-emission  power  plants,  a  new  generation  of  turbine  technology  is
needed  that  is  capable  of  operating  on  hydrogen  fuels,  without  compromising  oper-
ational performance, while achieving ultra-low NOΧ emissions.

A  primary  goal  of  the  Advanced  Turbines  Program  is  to  show  by  2012  that  we
can  operate  on  hydrogen  fuel,  increase  efficiency  by  two  to  three  percentage  points
over  baseline,  and  reduce  NOΧ emissions  to  two  parts  per  million  (ppm).  At  the
same time, we hope to reduce capital cost when compared to today’s turbines in ex-
isting  IGCC  plants.  We  are  working  with  two  of  the  turbine  original  equipment
manufacturers, General Electric and Siemens Westinghouse, to meet these goals.

To facilitate the development of near-zero-emission coal-based power systems, the
Advanced Turbines Program is also funding R&D on oxygen-fired (oxy-fuel) turbines
and  combustors  that  provide  high  efficiency  through  the  use  of  ultra-high-tempera-
ture power cycles. Bringing such oxy-fuel combustors and turbines to commercial vi-
ability  will  require  development  and  integrated  testing  of  the  combustor,  turbine
components, advanced cooling technology, and materials.

To reduce the costs associated with sequestering CO2, the Advanced Turbines Pro-
gram is investigating novel approaches for CO2 compression, including development
of  the  Ramgen  shock-wave  compression  technology.  Successful  development  will  re-
duce  the  substantial  power  requirements  and  costs  associated  with  compression  for
any zero-emission approach.

The  Office  of  Fossil  Energy  has  been  developing  high-temperature  Solid  Oxide
Fuel Cells for a variety of applications under the Solid State Energy Conversion Al-
liance  (SECA)  program.  These  high-temperature  fuel  cells  offer  several  significant
advantages  to  coal-based  near-zero-emission  power  systems.  Recognizing  the  stra-
tegic  importance  of  being  able  to  operate  on  domestic  fuel  resources,  namely,  coal,
we are refocusing the program to coal-based power generation applications.

First,  electrochemical  power  generation  is  highly  efficient  and  can  result  in  large
savings by reducing the size and cost of the up-front gasification and clean-up parts
of  the  plant,  as  well  as  by  reducing  the  amount  of  CO2 that  has  to  be  sequestered.
Second,  solid  oxide  technology  can  directly  utilize  carbon  monoxide  and  methane
produced  in  gasification  without  the  need  to  shift  the  composition  of  the  syngas  to
pure hydrogen, which incurs cost and efficiency penalties.

Third, solid oxide fuel cells have built-in carbon separation capability if the anode
(fuel  side)  and  cathode  (oxidant  side)  streams  are  not  mixed.  We  expect  that  fuel
cells will provide over a 10 percentage point increase in efficiency in near-zero-emis-
sion  systems,  with  capital  costs  comparable  to  or  lower  than  current  gas  turbine/
steam turbine systems.

DOE’s  Carbon  Sequestration  Program  leverages  basic  and  applied  research  with
field  verification  to  assess  the  technical  and  economic  viability  of  CCS  as  a  green-
house  gas  mitigation  option.  The  Program  encompasses  two  main  elements:  Core
R&D and Validation and Deployment. The Core R&D element focuses on technology
solutions, including low-cost, low-energy intensive capture technologies, that can be
validated  and  deployed  in  the  field.  Lessons  learned  from  field  tests  are  fed  back
to the Core R&D element to guide future R&D.

The  key  challenges  the  program  is  addressing  are  to  demonstrate  the  ability  to
store  CO2 in  underground  geologic  formations  with  long-term  stability  (perma-
nence), to develop the ability to monitor and verify the fate of CO2, and to gain pub-
lic and regulatory acceptance. DOE’s seven Regional Carbon Sequestration Partner-
ships  are  engaged  in  an  effort  to  develop  and  validate  CCS  technology  in  different
geologies across the Nation.

Collectively, the seven Partnerships represent regions encompassing 97 percent of
coal-fired  CO2 emissions,  97  percent  of  industrial  CO2 emissions,  97  percent  of  the
total land mass, and essentially all of the geologic storage sites in the United States
potentially  available  for  sequestration.  The  Partnerships  are  evaluating  numerous
CCS  approaches  to  assess  which  approaches  are  best  suited  for  specific  geologies,
and  are  developing  the  framework  needed  to  validate  and  potentially  deploy  the
most promising technologies.

The Regional Partnership initiative is using a three-phased approach.
Characterization, the first phase, was initiated in 2003 and focused on character-
izing regional opportunities for CCS, and identifying regional CO2 sources and stor-
age  formations.  The  Characterization  Phase  was  completed  in  2005  and  led  to  the
current Validation Phase.

Validation, the second phase, focuses on field tests to validate the efficacy of CCS
technologies  in  a  variety  of  geologic  storage  sites  throughout  the  United  States.
Using  the  extensive  data  and  information  gathered  during  the  Characterization
Phase,  the  seven  Partnerships  identified  the  most  promising  opportunities  for  stor-
age in their regions and are performing widespread, multiple geologic field tests. In
addition,  the  Partnerships  are  verifying  regional  CO2 storage  capacities,  satisfying
project  permitting  requirements,  and  conducting  public  outreach  and  education  ac-
tivities.

Deployment,  the  third  phase,  involves  large-volume  injection  tests.  This  phase
was  initiated  this  fiscal  year  and  will  demonstrate  CO2 injection  and  storage  at  a
scale  necessary  to  demonstrate  potential  future  commercial  deployment.  The  geo-
logic  structures  to  be  tested  during  these  large-volume  storage  tests  will  serve  as
potential  candidate  sites  for  the  future  deployment  of  technologies  demonstrated  in
the  FutureGen  Project  as  well  as  the  Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  (CCPI).  The  De-
partment  expects  to  issue  a  CCPI  solicitation  for  carbon  capture  technologies  at
commercial scale in 2007.

DOE also recognizes the importance of the existing fleet of coal-fired power plants
in meeting energy demand and possible future carbon constraints. Research is being
pursued  to  develop  technologies  that  dramatically  lower  the  cost  of  capturing  CO2
from  power  plant  stack  emissions.  This  research,  supported  by  the  Office  of  Fossil
Energy, is exploring a wide range of approaches that includes membranes, ionic liq-
uids,  metal  organic  frameworks,  improved  CO2 sorbents,  advanced  combustor  con-
cepts,  advanced  scrubbing,  and  oxy-combustion.  Additionally,  advanced  research  is
being pursued on high-temperature materials, advanced sensors & controls, and ad-
vanced  visualization  software.  These  developments  could  provide  significant  effi-
ciency improvements and cost reductions for both existing and future power plants,
based on pulverized coal combustion.

The  FutureGen  Project  is  an  industry/government  partnership  to  design,  build,
and  operate  a  gasification-based,  nearly  emission-free,  coal-fired  electricity  produc-
tion plant. The 275-megawatt plant will be the cleanest fossil-fuel-fired power plant
in  the  world.  With  respect  to  sequestration  technologies,  FutureGen  will  test,  and
ideally  demonstrate  the  large-scale,  permanent  sequestration  of  the  captured  CO2
in  a  deep  saline  formation.  FutureGen  is  scheduled  to  operate  from  2012  to  2016,
followed by a CO2 monitoring phase. The data and experience derived from this im-
portant  endeavor  will  then  be  available  to  facilitate  the  design  of  the  next  genera-
tion of near-zero-emission plants.

By  working  in  partnership  with  other  federal  agencies,  utilities,  coal  companies,
research  organizations,  academia,  and  non-government  organizations,  we  hope  to
make  near-zero-emission  coal  technology  a  cost-effective  and  safe  option  to  help
meet our future power needs.

Mr.  Chairman,  and  Members  of  the  Committee,  this  completes  my  statement.  I

would be happy to take any questions you may have at this time.

STATEMENT  OF  DR.  ROBERT  J.  FINLEY,  DIRECTOR,  ENERGY
AND  EARTH  RESOURCES  CENTER,  ILLINOIS  STATE  GEO-
LOGICAL SURVEY
Dr. FINLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Com-

mittee.

Understanding the capacity to geologically sequester carbon diox-
ide as a byproduct of fossil fuel use, including the use of advanced
coal  technologies,  is  an  essential  strategy  to  mitigate  the  growing
potential  for  climate  change  related  to  CO2 buildup  in  the  atmos-
phere.

At  the  Illinois  State  Geological  Survey,  we  have  been  inves-
tigating  this  capacity  for  more  than  five  years,  and  since  October
of 2003, have been doing so as part of a competitively awarded U.S.
Department of Energy Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership.
This partnership covers the Illinois Basin, a geological feature that
covers  most  of  Illinois,  Southwestern  Indiana,  and  Western  Ken-
tucky.

Our  Phase  I  effort  focused  on  compiling  and  evaluating  existing
data,  and  resulted  in  a  496-page  report,  indicating  that  one,  suit-
able CO2 sequestration reservoirs are present in the Illinois Basin,
and  that  sufficient  sequestration  capacity  existed  to  warrant  fur-
ther investigation. We then entered a Phase II validation effort, in
which we are currently engaged, in which six small-scale field pilot
projects will be carried out through September 2009.

In  July  2006,  DOE  managers  of  the  Regional  Carbon  Sequestra-
tion Partnership began the process of developing a Carbon Seques-
tration  Atlas  of  the  United  States  and  Canada.  This  Atlas  was  re-
leased  in  digital  form  in  March  of  this  year,  and  the  first  edition
of  the  printed  version  was  released  last  week  at  the  DOE  Annual
Carbon  Capture  and  Sequestration  Conference.  I  have  a  copy  of  it
here that Members may peruse at their leisure. I would be pleased
to leave it with you.

The Atlas suggests that there are some 3,500 billion tons of stor-
age  capacity  in  the  regions  covered  by  the  partnerships.  In  my
judgment, there is sufficient geological carbon sequestration capac-
ity  in  the  United  States  for  geological  sequestration  to  be  one  of
multiple  tools  used  on  a  large  scale  to  reduce  CO2 emissions  from
fixed sources, such as coal gasification facilities.

While  compiling  our  Phase  I  report,  and  while  setting  up  envi-
ronmental monitoring programs are integral to each of the six field
pilots,  we  have  been  aware  of  the  need  to  understand  the  risks,
both  short-term  and  long-term,  of  geological  carbon  sequestration.
We have been paying as much attention to the overlying rock that

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

will  hold  the  carbon  dioxide  in  place,  the  caprock  or  the  seals,  as
we have to the rock into which the CO2 itself will be injected.

To  be  an  effective  climate  change  mitigation  strategy,  the  CO2
must remain in place and not leak back to the atmosphere, not con-
taminate  potable  groundwater,  not  affect  surface  biota,  and  not
present a risk to human health and safety. We know that rock for-
mations can perform this in an effective manner, as both reservoirs
and seals, because they have trapped and held oil and natural gas
that  we  drill  for  and  produce  every  day.  These  hydrocarbons  have
been  trapped  in  place  for  millions  to  hundreds  of  millions  of  years
before being brought to the surface through wells. To minimize the
risk  of  CO2 injection,  the  reverse  of  the  process  of  oil  and  natural
gas  production,  we  need  to  apply  many  of  these  same  advanced
methods that we use to find oil and natural gas. We need to evalu-
ate  subsurface  rock  formations  to  find  thick  and  competent  res-
ervoir seals, to avoid areas where faults and fractures could become
leakage  pathways,  and  to  understand  the  chemical  changes  in  the
pore space of the rock where the CO2 will be injected.

With  respect  to  the  safety  of  established  projects,  we  have  been
injecting CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in reservoirs in West Texas
for more than two decades. Since 1983, more than 600 million tons
of pressurized CO2 have been injected into the surface, and 30 mil-
lion tons are being injected currently on an annual basis. The safe-
ty  record  of  this  process  has  been  excellent,  with  not  a  single  loss
of  life  incident  during  the  period  of  injection.  The  injection  of  one
million  tons  per  year  of  CO2 for  sequestration  beneath  the  seabed
of  the  North  Sea  has  been  taking  place  since  1996,  and  based  on
published reports, this process has been both safe and effective.

I would conclude from this experience with CO2, and from indus-
try experience with geological storage of natural gas, that we could
readily  proceed  with  large-scale,  by  which  I  mean  one  million  tons
per  year  tests  of  geological  sequestration  for  further  evaluation  of
reservoirs  and  caprocks  as  they  vary  geologically  around  the  coun-
try.

To establish public confidence, all the regional partnerships have
been carrying out outreach and education activities, and have been
integrating  environmental  monitoring  into  our  small-scale  CO2
pilot tests. As we move to the upcoming larger scale tests, we need
to  invest  even  more  into  education,  outreach,  and  especially  envi-
ronmental  monitoring  to  ensure  public  confidence.  Our  experience
to  date,  very  much  informed  by  the  public  meetings  that  we  have
held  in  regard  to  the  two  FutureGen  finalist  sites,  which  we  are
fortunate  to  have  in  the  State  of  Illinois,  has  been  the  process  of
ensuring  openness  and  transparency  to  help  gain  the  public  trust.
Yes, we are putting something new into the subsurface. Yes, there
are  small  and  difficult  to  quantify  risks,  such  as  slow  leakage,  in-
volved in carrying out any such effort, but yes, we are working dili-
gently and in the most open way possible to investigate the geology
of sequestration, and I believe that the geologic framework has the
capacity  and  the  security  that  we  require  to  make  sequestration  a
viable carbon management strategy.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT J. FINLEY

Understanding the capacity to geologically sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) as a by-
product  of  fossil  fuel  use,  including  the  use  of  advanced  coal  technologies,  is  an  es-
sential strategy to mitigate the growing potential for climate change related to car-
bon  dioxide  buildup  in  the  atmosphere.  At  the  Illinois  State  Geological  Survey,  we
have  been  investigating  this  capacity  for  more  than  five  years,  and,  since  October
of 2003, have been doing so as part of a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Regional
Carbon Sequestration Partnership. This Partnership covers the Illinois Basin, a geo-
logical feature that extends across most of Illinois, southwestern Indiana, and west-
ern  Kentucky.  Our  sister  geological  surveys  in  Indiana  and  Kentucky  are  our  part-
ners in this research. Our Phase I effort focused on compiling and evaluating exist-
ing data and resulted in a 496-page report in December 2005 indicating 1) that suit-
able CO2 sequestration reservoirs were present in the Illinois Basin, and that 2) suf-
ficient sequestration capacity existed warranting further investigation. We then en-
tered  a  Phase  II  validation  effort,  in  which  we  are  currently  engaged,  in  which  six
small-scale, field pilot injection projects will be carried out through September 2009.
The  injection  phase  of  one  field  pilot  has  been  completed  and  two  more  will  see  ei-
ther  injection  or  drilling  of  new  wells  for  injection  within  the  next  90  days.  While
planning and executing these field pilot projects, we have also been making further
detailed  assessments  of  geological  storage  capacity,  as  have  the  other  six  partner-
ships.

In July 2006, DOE managers for the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships
convened  a  meeting  at  the  Kansas  Geological  Survey  to  begin  the  process  of  devel-
oping  a  Carbon  Sequestration  Atlas  of  the  United  States  and  Canada.  This  Atlas
was  released  in  digital  form  in  March  2007  and  the  first  edition  of  the  printed
version  was  released  last  week  in  Pittsburgh  at  DOE’s  annual  carbon  capture  and
sequestration conference. The Atlas was developed on the basis of regional partner-
ship  work  that  began  in  2003,  and  earlier,  to  understand  the  major  geological  res-
ervoirs  that  may  be  utilized  for  carbon  sequestration.  This  Atlas  also  builds  on  the
work supported by DOE in the form of the original MIDCARB, and now NATCARB,
digital  databases  that  are  accessible  on  the  Internet.  The  Atlas  documented  some
3,500 billion tons of storage capacity in the regions covered by the Partnerships. In
my  judgment  there  is  sufficient  geological  carbon  sequestration  capacity  in  the
United  States  for  geological  sequestration  to  be  one  of  multiple  tools  useful  on  a
large  scale  to  reduce  CO2 emissions  from  fixed  sources  such  as  coal  gasification  fa-
cilities.  In  the  Illinois  Basin  region,  if  we  could  capture  80  percent  of  all  current
fixed-source emissions, a volume of 237 million tons of CO2 per year, we would have
storage capacity for 122 to 485 years of emissions just in the deep saline reservoirs.
While  compiling  our  Phase  I  report,  and  while  setting  up  environmental  moni-
toring  programs  integral  to  each  of  our  six  field  pilot  projects,  we  have  been  aware
of the need to understand the risks, both short- and long-term, of geological carbon
sequestration.  We  have  been  paying  as  much  attention  to  the  overlying  rock  that
will  hold  the  carbon  dioxide  in  place,  the  reservoir  seal  or  caprock,  as  we  have  to
the qualities of the reservoir rock that the CO2 will be injected into. To be an effec-
tive climate change mitigation strategy, the CO2 must remain in place and not leak
back  to  the  atmosphere,  not  contaminate  potable  ground  water,  not  affect  surface
biota, and not present a risk to human health and safety. That implies that we must
do an excellent job of investigating the properties of these rocks and the fluids now
within them and predicting their performance in the future. We know that rock for-
mations can perform as effective reservoirs and seals because they have trapped and
held  the  oil  and  natural  gas  that  we  drill  for  and  produce  every  day.  These  hydro-
carbons have been trapped in place for millions to hundreds of millions of years be-
fore being brought to the surface through wells. To minimize the risk in CO2 injec-
tion, the reverse of the oil or natural gas production process, we need to apply many
of  the  same  advanced  methods  as  we  use  to  find  oil  and  natural  gas.  We  need  to
evaluate  subsurface  rock  formations  to  find  thick  and  competent  reservoir  seals,  to
avoid  areas  where  faults  and  fractures  could  become  leakage  pathways,  and  to  un-
derstand  the  chemical  changes  in  the  pore  space  of  the  rock  that  the  CO2 will  be
injected  into.  All  of  this  can  be  done  to  mitigate  risk  and  if  done  well,  and  in  suffi-
cient  detail,  will  allow  appropriate  sites  with  minimum  risk  to  be  selected  for  geo-
logical  sequestration.  After  all,  we  also  have  decades  of  experience  with  under-
ground  natural  gas  storage  projects  at  sites  where  tens  of  billions  of  cubic  feet  of
flammable natural gas are stored safely and effectively.

With respect to the safety of established projects, we have been injecting CO2 for
enhanced  oil  recovery  in  West  Texas  for  more  than  two  decades.  Since  1983,  more
than 600 million tons of pressurized CO2 have been injected and 30 million tons are
currently  being  injected  annually  in  West  Texas  oil  reservoirs.  The  safety  record  of

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6621 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

this process has been excellent with not a single incident of loss of life. The injection
of CO2 for sequestration beneath the seabed of the North Sea has been taking place
since  1996,  and  based  on  published  reports,  the  CO2 has  been  readily  tracked  in
the  subsurface  using  geophysical  techniques  and  the  process  has  been  safe  and  ef-
fective. About one million metric tonnes per year are being injected at a sub-seabed
depth  of  3,300  feet  under  a  caprock  about  260  feet  thick,  comparable  to  shale
caprocks in the Illinois Basin. I would conclude from this experience with CO2, and
from industry experience with geological storage of natural gas, that we should pro-
ceed  with  large-scale  (one  million  tons/year  to  one  million  tons  over  three  to  four
years)  tests  of  geological  carbon  sequestration  for  further  evaluation  of  reservoirs
and  caprocks  as  they  vary  in  different  regions  of  the  country.  These  projects  need
to  be  well  funded  and  designed  to  build  on  the  technical  experience  I  have  just  de-
scribed.

To  establish  public  confidence,  all  the  regional  partnerships  have  been  carrying
out  public  outreach  activities  and  have  been  integrating  environmental  monitoring
into their small-scale field testing of CO2 injection during Phase II. For our Illinois
Basin  region,  this  monitoring  has  been  the  largest  single  budget  item  in  our  Phase
II  project,  and  appropriately  so.  As  we  move  to  the  upcoming  larger-scale  tests,  we
need  to  invest  even  more  into  education,  outreach,  and,  especially,  environmental
monitoring to ensure public confidence. Our experience to date, very much informed
by the public meetings we have held with regard to the two FutureGen finalist sites
in  Illinois,  has  been  that  openness  and  transparency  are  essential  to  the  process  of
gaining  public  trust.  Yes,  we  are  putting  something  new  into  the  subsurface.  Yes,
there are small and difficult-to-quantify risks, such as slow leakage, involved in car-
rying out any such effort. But, yes, we are working diligently and in the most open
way possible to investigate the geology of sequestration, and I believe that the geo-
logic  framework  has  the  capacity  and  the  security  that  we  require  to  make  seques-
tration  a  viable  carbon  management  strategy.  I  also  believe,  however,  that  some
budget  figures  that  I  have  seen  for  FY08  and  FY09  are  inadequate  to  fully  execute
and monitor these critical large-scale tests in diverse geological settings around the
U.S.  I  trust  that  this  subcommittee  and  the  Full  Committee  on  Science  and  Tech-
nology will have the opportunity to review those allocations and give priority to the
Phase  III  Regional  Partnership  Program’s  large-scale  testing,  among  other  impor-
tant sequestration programs that benefit from the investments made to date in tech-
nology and expertise by the Department of Energy.

In summary, I would suggest to the Subcommittee that we are beginning to have
a  substantive  understanding  of  the  geological  capacity  for  carbon  sequestration,  es-
pecially  based  on  research  over  the  last  two  to  five  years  in  the  U.S.  and  inter-
nationally. Advanced coal technologies including coal gasification for electricity pro-
duction, coal to synthetic natural gas, and coal to liquid fuels will depend on geologi-
cal  sequestration  capacity  to  directly  manage  their  CO2 emissions.  The  need  for
such management has been made all the more evident by the growing concern over
climate  change  as  embodied  in  the  assessments  released  by  the  Intergovernmental
Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  and  other  groups  since  February  of  this  year.
While  we  are  advancing  sequestration  technology,  we  must  also  address  issues  of
long-term  liability  for  sequestration  projects,  legal  access  to  subsurface  pore  space,
and  issues  of  who  will  bear  the  costs  of  sequestration  and  how  those  costs  will  be
distributed.  Some  of  these  issues  are  beginning  to  be  articulated,  but  it  is  unlikely
that these issues, or the testing of advanced coal technologies combined with carbon
sequestration, can be addressed without unprecedented public-private collaboration.
I  urge  this  subcommittee  to  facilitate  that  process  as  we  look  forward  to  imple-
menting advanced coal technologies incorporating geological carbon sequestration as
a preferred and routine approach to coal utilization.

STATEMENT  OF  MR.  MICHAEL  W.  RENCHECK,  SENIOR  VICE
PRESIDENT,  ENGINEERING,  PROJECTS  AND  FIELD  SERV-
ICES, AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER
Mr.  RENCHECK.  Good  afternoon,  Mr.  Chairman  and  Members  of
the  Committee.  Thank  you  for  inviting  me  to  participate  in  this
meeting.

American Electric Power is one of the Nation’s largest electricity
utilities, with more than five million retail customers in 11 States.
We  are  also  one  of  the  Nation’s  largest  power  generators,  with
more than 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity from a diverse
fleet. In a particular note for today, AEP is one of the largest coal-
fired  electric  generators  in  the  U.S.,  and  we  have  implemented  a
portfolio  of  voluntary  actions  to  reduce,  avoid,  and  offset  green-
house gases during the past decade.

Coal  generates  over  50  percent  of  the  electricity  used  in  the
United  States,  and  is  used  extensively  worldwide.  As  demand  for
electricity  increases  significantly,  coal  use  will  increase  as  well.  In
the  future,  coal-fired  electric  generation  must  be  zero-emission  or
close to it. This will be achieved through new technologies that are
being  developed  today,  but  are  not  yet  proven  or  commercially
available.

Like  most  companies  in  our  sector,  AEP  needs  new  generation.
We are investing in new clean coal technology that will enable AEP
and  our  industry  to  meet  the  challenge  of  reducing  greenhouse
gases for the long-term. This includes plans to build two new inte-
grated  gasification  combined  cycle  units,  IGCC,  and  two  state-of-
the-art ultrasupercritical units. These will be the first new genera-
tion  of  ultrasupercritical  and  IGCC  units  deployed  in  the  United
States.  AEP  is  also  taking  a  lead  role  of  commercializing  carbon
capture  technology  for  use  on  new  generation,  and  more  impor-
tantly, for use on existing generation as a retrofit.

We  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  also  for  post-com-
bustion capture technology using Alstom’s chilled ammonia system.
Starting with a commercial performance verification project in mid
to  late  2008  in  West  Virginia,  a  project  that  will  also  include  stor-
age  of  the  carbon  dioxide  in  a  saline  aquifer,  we  will  move  to  the
first commercial sized project at one of our 450-megawatt plants at
our  Northeastern  Unit  in  Oklahoma  in  2011.  This  would  capture
about  1.5  million  metric  tons  of  CO2 per  year,  which  will  be  used
for enhanced oil recovery.

We are also working with Babcock and Wilcox to develop its oxy-
coal combustion technology, through development of a 30-megawatt
thermal pilot plant at its Barberton, Ohio facility in 2007. Oxy-coal
combustion forms a concentrated CO2 post-combustion gas that can
be stored without additional post-combustion gas processing equip-
ment.  We  are  hoping  to  bring  this  technology  from  the  drawing
board to commercial scale early in the next decade.

Retrofitting  our  existing  fleet  to  ensure  carbon  capture  will  be
neither  easy  nor  inexpensive,  and  AEP  is  very  comfortable  leading
the  way.  We  have  a  long  and  impressive  list  of  technological  firsts
that  we  achieved  during  our  first  hundred  years  of  existence,  but
we  have  identified  one  very  important  caveat  during  our  century
of  technological  achievement  and  engineering  excellence.  Proving
technology  to  be  commercially  viable  and  having  that  technology
ready for widespread commercial use are two very different things.
It  takes  time  to  develop  off-the-shelf  commercial  offerings  for  new
technology.

AEP  is  not  calling  for  an  indefinite  delay  in  the  enactment  of
mandatory  climate  change  legislation  until  the  advanced  tech-
nology, such as carbon capture and storage, is developed. However,
as  the  requirements  become  more  stringent  during  the  next  ten  to
twenty years, and we move beyond the availability of current tech-
nology to deliver those reductions, it is essential that requirements
for  deeper  reductions  allow  sufficient  time  for  the  demonstration
and commercialization of these advanced technologies.

How  can  you  help?  It  is  also  important  to  establish  public  fund-
ing,  as  well  as  incentives  for  private  funding,  for  the  development
of  commercially  viable  technology  solutions,  as  well  as  providing
the  legal  and  the  regulatory  framework  to  facilitate  this  develop-
ment. AEP believes that the IGCC and carbon capture and storage
technologies need to be advanced, but the building of an IGCC and
the  timely  development  of  commercially  viable  carbon  capture  and
sequestration technologies will require additional public funding.

AEP and others in our sectors have already invested heavily into
research  and  early  development  of  technologies  that  may  eventu-
ally  be  commercially  viable  solutions  to  capture  and  store  green-
house gas emissions. For this reason, separate investment tax cred-
its  are  needed  to  facilitate  both  the  construction  of  IGCC  plants
now, and the development of CCS technologies for future use.

American  industry  has  long  been  staffed  by  excellent  problem
solvers.  I  am  confident  we  will  be  able  to  develop  the  technologies
to  efficiently  address  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  in  an  increas-
ingly  cost-effective  manner.  We  have  the  brainpower.  We  need
time, funding assistance, and the legal or regulatory support.

Thank you.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF MICHAEL W. RENCHECK

Summary of Testimony

American Electric Power (AEP) is one of the Nation’s largest electricity generators
with  over  five  million  retail  consumers  in  11  states.  AEP  has  a  diverse  generating
fleet—coal,  nuclear,  hydroelectric,  gas,  oil  and  wind.  But  of  particular  note,  AEP  is
one of the largest coal-fired electricity generators in the U.S.

Over  the  last  100  years,  AEP  has  led  the  Industry  in  developing  and  deploying
new  technologies  beginning  with  the  first  high  voltage  transmission  lines  at  345
kilovolt  (kV)  and  765  kV  to  new  and  more  efficient  coal  power  plants  starting  with
the  large  central  station  power  plant  progressing  to  super-critical  and  ultra-super-
critical  power  plants.  During  the  past  decade,  American  Electric  Power  has  imple-
mented  a  portfolio  of  voluntary  actions  to  reduce,  avoid  or  offset  greenhouse  gases
(GHG). During 2003–05, AEP reduced its GHG emissions by 31 million metric tons
of CO2 by planting trees, adding wind power, increasing power plant generating effi-
ciency, and retiring less-efficient units among other measures.

We also continue to invest in new clean coal technology that will enable AEP and
our  industry  to  meet  the  challenge  of  reducing  GHG  emissions  for  the  long-term.

This  includes  plans  to  build  two  new  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC)
plants and two state-of-the-art, ultra-super-critical plants. These will be the first of
the  new  generation  of  ultra-super-critical  plants  in  the  U.S.  AEP  plans  to  take  a
lead  role  in  commercializing  carbon  capture  technology.  We  signed  a  memorandum
of understanding (MOU) with Alstom for post-combustion carbon capture technology
using  its  chilled  ammonia  system.  Starting  with  a  ‘‘commercial  performance
verification’’ project in mid to late 2008 in West Virginia, we would move to the first
commercial-sized  project  at  one  of  our  450-megawatt  coal-fired  units  at  North-
eastern Plant in Oklahoma by late 2011. This would capture about 1.5 million met-
ric  tons  of  CO2 a  year,  which  will  be  used  for  enhanced  oil  recovery.  Additionally,
we signed a memorandum of understanding with Babcock and Wilcox to participate
in a oxy-coal pilot project. This project will be used to refine the process and eventu-
ally determine if the combustion technology can be retrofit into existing plants.

Over all, AEP supports the adoption of an economy-wide cap-and-trade type GHG
reduction  program  that  is  well  thought-out,  achievable,  and  reasonable.  We  believe
legislation can be crafted that does not impede AEP’s ability to provide reliable, rea-
sonably  priced  electricity  to  support  the  economic  well-being  of  our  customers,  and
includes mechanisms that foster international participation and avoids harming the
U.S. economy. A pragmatic approach for phasing in GHG reductions through a cap-
and-trade  program  coincident  with  developing  technologies  to  support  these  reduc-
tions will be critical to crafting achievable and reasonable legislation.

The development of these technologies will be facilitated by and are dependent on
public  funding  through  tax  credits  and  similar  incentives.  AEP  is  doing  its  part  as
we aggressively explore the viability of this technology in several first-of-a-kind com-
mercial  projects.  We  are  advancing  the  development  of  IGCC  and  other  necessary
technologies  as  we  seek  to  build  two  IGCC  plants  and  two  state-of-the-art  ultra-
super-critical  power  plants.  1n  addition,  we  are  a  founding  member  of  FutureGen,
a  ground-breaking  public-private  collaboration  that  aims  squarely  at  making  near-
zero-emissions coal-based energy a reality. Simply put, however, commercially engi-
neered  and  available  technology  to  capture  and  store  CO2 does  not  economically
exist  today  and  we  strongly  recommend  that  any  legislation  you  adopt  reflect  this
fact.
Testimony

Good morning Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the House Committee

on Science and Technology, Subcommittee on Energy and Environment.

Thank you for inviting me here today. Thank you for this opportunity to offer the
views of American Electric Power (AEP) and for soliciting the views of our industry
and others on climate change technologies.

My name is Mike Rencheck, Senior Vice President—Engineering, Projects & Field
Services  of  American  Electric  Power  (AEP).  Headquartered  in  Columbus,  Ohio,  we
are  one  of  the  Nation’s  largest  electricity  generators—with  over  36,000  megawatts
of  generating  capacity—and  serve  more  than  five  million  retail  consumers  in  11
states  in  the  Midwest  and  south  central  regions  of  our  nation.  AEP’s  generating
fleet  employs  diverse  sources  of  fuel—including  coal,  nuclear,  hydroelectric,  natural
gas, and oil and wind power. But of particular importance for the Committee Mem-
bers  here  today,  AEP  uses  more  coal  than  any  other  electricity  generator  in  the
Western hemisphere.
AEP’s Technology Development

Over  the  last  100  years,  AEP  has  been  an  industry  leader  in  developing  and  de-
ploying new technologies beginning with the first high voltage transmission lines at
345  kilovolt  (kV)  and  765kV,  to  new  and  more  efficient  coal  power  plants  starting
with  the  large  central  station  power  plant,  progressing  to  super-critical  and  ultra-
super-critical  powers  plants.  We  are  continuing  that  today.  We  have  implemented
14 selective catalytic reactors (SCRs), and 10 Flue Gas Desulphurization units, with
others  currently  under  construction,  and  we  are  a  leader  in  developing  and  deploy-
ing  mercury  capture  and  monitoring  technology.  In  addition,  we  continue  to  invest
in new clean coal technology plants and R&D that will enable AEP and our industry
to  meet  the  challenge  of  significantly  reducing  GHG  emissions  in  future  years.  For
example, AEP is working to build two new generating plants using Integrated Gas-
ification  Combined  Cycle  (IGCC)  technology  in  Ohio  and  West  Virginia,  as  well  as
two  highly  efficient  new  generating  plants  using  the  most  advanced  (e.g.,  ultra-
super-critical)  pulverized  coal  combustion  technology  in  Arkansas  and  Oklahoma.
We  are  also  providing  a  leading  role  in  the  FutureGen  project,  which  once  com-
pleted, will be the world’s first near-zero CO2 emitting commercial scale coal-fueled
power  plant.  We  are  also  working  to  progress  specific  carbon  capture  and  storage
technology.

AEP’s Major New Initiative to Reduce GHG Emissions

22

In  March,  AEP  announced  several  major  new  initiatives  to  reduce  AEP’s  GHG
emissions and to advance the commercial application of carbon capture and storage
technology  and  Oxy-coal  combustion.  Our  company  has  been  advancing  technology
for the electric utility industry for more than 100 years. AEP’s recent announcement
continues to build upon this heritage. Technology development needs are often cited
as an excuse for inaction. We see these needs as opportunities for action.

AEP  has  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  with  Alstom,  a  world-
wide  leader  in  equipment  and  services  for  power  generation,  for  post-combustion
carbon  capture  technology  using  Alstom’s  chilled  ammonia  system.  It  will  be  in-
stalled  at  our  1,300-megawatt  Mountaineer  Plant  in  New  Haven,  West  Virginia  as
a  ‘‘30-megawatt  (thermal)  commercial  performance  verification’’  project  in  mid  to
late  2008  and  it  will  capture  up  to  100,000  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  per
year. Once the CO2 is captured, we will store it. The Mountaineer site has an exist-
ing  deep  saline  aquifer  injection  well  previously  developed  in  conjunction  with  the
Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  and  Battelle.  Working  with  Battelle  and  with  contin-
ued  DOE  support,  we  will  use  this  well  (and  develop  others)  to  store  and  further
study CO2 injection into deep geological formations.

Following the completion of commercial verification at Mountaineer, AEP plans to
install  Alstom’s  system  on  one  of  the  450-megawatt  coal-fired  units  at  its  North-
eastern Plant in Oologah, Oklahoma, as a first-of-a-kind commercial demonstration.
The system is expected to capture approximately 1.5 million metric tons of CO2 per
year  and  be  operational  in  late  2011.  The  CO2 captured  at  Northeastern  Plant  will
be used for enhanced oil recovery.

AEP  has  also  signed  an  MOU  with  Babcock  and  Wilcox  to  pursue  the  develop-
ment  of  Oxy-coal  combustion  that  uses  oxygen  in  lieu  of  air  for  combustion.  The
Oxy-coal  combustion  forms  a  concentrated  CO2 post  combustion  gas  that  can  be
stored  without  additional  post  combustion  capture  processes.  AEP  is  working  with
B&W  on  a  ‘‘30-megawatt  (thermal)  pilot  project.’’  The  results  are  due  in  mid-2007
and  then  these  results  will  be  used  to  study  the  feasibility  of  a  scaled  up  100–
200MW  (electric)  demonstration.  The  CO2 from  the  demonstration  project  would  be
captured and stored in a deep saline geologic formation or used for enhanced oil re-
covery application.

In  March,  AEP  also  voluntarily  committed  to  achieve  an  additional  five  million
tons  of  GHG  reductions  annually  beginning  in  2011.  We  will  accomplish  these  re-
ductions through a new AEP initiative that will add another 1,000MW of purchased
wind power into our system, substantially increase our forestry investments (in ad-
dition to the 62 million trees we have planted to date), as well as invest in domestic
offsets, such as methane capture from agriculture, mines, and landfills.

AEP has also implemented efficiency improvements at several plants in its exist-
ing  generation  fleet.  These  improvements  include  new  turbine  blading,  valve  re-
placements, combustion tuning, and installation of variable speed drives on rotating
equipment.  Such  improvements  are  currently  reported  through  the  Department  of
Energy’s 1605 (b) program to the extent they produce creditable reductions in green-
house gas emissions. However, we are limited in the efficiency improvements we can
make due to the ambiguities in the existing New Source Review program, and sup-
port  further  clarification  and  reform  of  this  program  to  encourage  efficiency  im-
provements.
AEP Perspectives on a Federal GHG Reduction Program

While  AEP  has  done  much,  and  will  do  much  more,  to  mitigate  GHG  emissions
from its existing sources, we also support the adoption of an economy-wide cap-and-
trade type GHG reduction program that is well thought-out, achievable, and reason-
able. Although today I intend to focus on the need for the development and deploy-
ment  of  commercially  viable  technologies  to  address  climate  change  and  not  on  the
specific  policy  issues  that  must  be  addressed,  AEP  believes  that  legislation  can  be
crafted  that  does  not  impede  AEP’s  ability  to  provide  reliable,  reasonably  priced
electricity to support the economic well-being of our customers, and includes mecha-
nisms that foster international participation and avoid creating inequities and com-
petitive issues that would harm the U.S. economy. AEP supports reasonable legisla-
tion, and is not calling for an indefinite delay until advanced technology to support
carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS),  among  others,  is  developed.  However,  as  the  re-
quirements  become  more  stringent  during  the  next  ten  to  twenty  years,  and  we
move beyond the ability of current technology to deliver those reductions, it is essen-
tial  that  requirements  for  deeper  reductions  coincide  with  the  commercialization  of
advanced technologies.

Phased-in Timing and Gradually Increasing Level of Reductions Consistent
With Technology Development That Is Facilitated by Public Fund-
ing

As  a  practical  matter,  implementing  climate  legislation  is  a  complex  undertaking
that will require procedures for measuring, verifying, and accounting for GHG emis-
sions,  as  well  as  for  designing  efficient  administration  and  enforcement  procedures
applicable to all sectors of our economy. Only a pragmatic approach with achievable
targets,  supported  by  commercial  technology,  and  reasonable  timetables—that  does
not require too many reductions within too short a time period—will succeed.

AEP also believes that the level of emissions reductions and timing of those reduc-
tions  under  a  federal  mandate  must  keep  pace  with  developing  technologies  for  re-
ducing GHG emissions from new and existing sources. The technologies for effective
carbon capture and storage from coal-fired facilities are developing, but are not com-
mercially engineered to meet production needs, and cannot be artificially accelerated
through unrealistic reduction mandates.

While  AEP  and  other  companies  have  successfully  lowered  their  average  emis-
sions  and  emission  rates  during  this  decade,  further  substantial  reductions  will  re-
quire the wide-scale commercial availability of new clean coal technologies. AEP be-
lieves that the electric power industry can potentially manage much of the expected
economic  (and  CO2 emissions)  growth  over  the  course  of  the  next  decade  (2010–
2020)  through  aggressively  deploying  renewable  energy,  achieving  further  gains  in
supply  and  demand-side  energy  efficiency,  and  implementing  new  emission  offset
projects. As stated above, AEP supports reasonable legislation, and is not calling for
an  indefinite  delay  of  GHG  reduction  obligations  until  advanced  clean  coal  tech-
nology is developed. However, as the reduction requirements become more stringent,
and  move  beyond  the  ability  of  current  technologies  to  deliver  those  reductions,  it
is  important  that  those  stringent  requirements  coincide  with  the  commercialization
of advanced technology. This includes the next generation of low- and zero-emitting
technologies.

Significantly, today’s costs of new clean coal technologies with carbon capture and
storage are much more expensive than current coal-fired technologies. For example,
carbon  capture  and  storage  using  current  inhibited  monoethanolamine  (MEA)  tech-
nology  is  expected  to  increase  the  cost  of  electricity  from  a  new  coal  fired  power
plant by about 60–70 percent. Even the newer chilled ammonia carbon capture tech-
nology we plan to deploy on a commercial sized scale by 2012 at one of our existing
coal-fired units will result in significantly higher costs.

Additionally the MEA technology has limitations under existing plant retrofit con-
ditions. CO2 capture requires a large volume of steam to regenerate the amine used
to  capture  the  CO2.  Review  of  several  of  our  existing  PC  units  indicates  they  can
only supply enough steam from the power generation cycle to regenerate the amine
necessary  to  capture  about  50  percent  of  the  CO2,  without  jeopardizing  the  steam
cycle.

It is only through the steady and judicious advancement of these applications dur-
ing  the  course  of  the  next  decade  that  we  can  start  to  bring  these  costs  down,  in
order  to  avoid  substantial  electricity  rate  shocks  and  undue  harm  to  the  U.S.  econ-
omy.

IGCC  technology,  for  example,  integrates  two  proven  processes—coal  gasification
and  combined  cycle  power  generation—to  convert  coal  into  electricity  more  effi-
ciently  and  cleanly  than  any  existing  uncontrolled  power  plant  can.  Not  only  is  it
cleaner  and  more  efficient  than  today’s  installed  power  plants,  but  IGCC  has  the
potential  to  be  retrofitted  in  the  future  for  carbon  capture  at  a  lower  capital  cost
and  with  less  of  an  energy  penalty  than  traditional  power  plant  technologies,  but
only  after  the  technology  has  been  developed  and  proven.  Our  IGCC  plants  will  in-
corporate  the  space  and  layout  for  the  addition  of  components  to  capture  CO2 for
sequestration.

Our IGCC plants will be among the earliest, if not the first, deployments of large-
scale IGCC technology. The cost of constructing these plants will be high, resulting
in a cost of generated electricity that would be twenty to thirty percent greater than
that from pulverized coal (PC) combustion technology. As more plants are built, the
costs of construction are expected to come into line with the cost of PC plants.

To help bridge the cost gap and move IGCC technology down the cost curve, there
is  a  need  for  continuation  and  expansion  of  the  advanced  coal  project  tax  credits
that were introduced by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. All of the available tax cred-
its for IGCC projects using bituminous coal were allocated to only two projects dur-
ing  the  initial  allocation  round  in  2006.  More  IGCC  plants  are  needed  to  facilitate
this technology. AEP believes an additional one billion dollars of section 48A (of the
Internal  Revenue  Code)  tax  credits  are  needed,  with  the  bulk  of  that  dedicated  to
IGCC projects without regard to coal type.

24

Along  with  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  the  credits,  changes  are  needed  in  the
manner  in  which  the  credits  are  allocated.  Advanced  coal  project  credits  should  be
allocated  based  on  net  generating  capacity  and  not  based  upon  the  estimated  gross
nameplate generating capacity of projects. Allocation based upon gross, rather than
net, generating capacity potentially rewards less efficient projects, which is antithet-
ical  to  the  purpose  of  advanced  coal  project  tax  incentives.  AEP  also  believes  that
the  Secretary  of  Energy  should  be  delegated  a  significant  role  in  the  selection  of
IGCC projects that will receive tax credits.

On  a  critical  note,  the  inclusion  of  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  equipment
must  not  be  a  prerequisite  for  the  allocation  of  these  additional  tax  credits  due  to
the  urgent  need  for  new  electric  generating  capacity  in  the  U.S.  AEP  also  believes
that  this  requirement  is  premature  and  self-defeating  to  advancing  IGCC  tech-
nology.  The  addition  would  require  yet-to-be  developed  technology  and/or  would
cause  the  projected  cost  of  a  project  to  increase  significantly,  making  it  that  much
more difficult for a public utility commission to approve.

AEP  also  believes  that  additional  tax  incentives  are  needed  to  spur  the  develop-
ment  and  deployment  of  greenhouse  gas  capture  and  sequestration  equipment  for
all  types  of  coal  fired  generation.  We  suggest  that  additional  tax  credits  be  estab-
lished to offset a significant portion of the incremental cost of capturing and seques-
tering CO2. These incentives could be structured partly as an investment tax credit,
similar  to  that  in  section  48A  (of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code),  to  cover  the  up-front
capital  cost,  and  partly  as  a  production  tax  credit  to  cover  the  associated  operating
costs.

In  summary,  AEP  recommends  a  pragmatic  approach  for  phasing  in  GHG  reduc-
tions  through  a  cap-and-trade  program  coincident  with  developing  technologies  to
support these reductions.
Technology Is the Answer to Climate Change

The primary human-induced cause of global warming is the emission of CO2 aris-
ing from the burring of fossil fuels. Put simply, our primary contribution to climate
change is also what drives the global economic engine.

Changing  consumer  behavior  by  buying  efficient  appliances  and  cars,  by  driving
less,  and  other  similar  steps,  is  helping  to  reduce  the  growth  of  GHG  emissions.
However,  these  steps  will  never  be  enough  to  significantly  reduce  CO2 emissions
from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Such incremental steps, while impor-
tant,  will  never  be  sufficient  to  stabilize  greenhouse  gases  concentrations  in  the  at-
mosphere  at  a  level  that  is  believed  to  be  capable  of  preventing  dangerous  human-
induced  interference  with  the  climate  system,  as  called  for  in  the  U.S.-approved
U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (Rio agreement). For that, we need
major technological advances to effectively capture and store CO2. The Congress and
indeed  all  Americans  must  come  to  recognize  the  gigantic  undertaking  and  signifi-
cant sacrifices that this enterprise is likely to require.

CCS should not be mandated until and unless it has been demonstrated to be ef-
fective and the costs have significantly dropped so that it becomes commercially en-
gineered and available on a widespread basis. Until that threshold is met, it would
be  technologically  unrealistic  and  economically  unacceptable  to  require  the  wide-
spread installation of carbon capture equipment. The use of deep saline geologic for-
mations  as  primary  long-term  CO2 storage  locations  has  not  yet  been  sufficiently
demonstrated.  There  are  no  national  standards  for  permitting  such  storage  res-
ervoirs; there are no widely accepted monitoring protocols; and the standards for li-
ability are unknown (as well as whether federal or State laws would apply). In addi-
tion, who owns the rights to these deep geologic reservoirs remains a question.

Outstanding  technical  questions  for  CO2 storage  include:  What  is  the  number  of
injector  wells  needed?  What  is  the  injector  well  lifespan?  What  is  the  injector  well
proximity to other wells? What measurement, monitoring, and verification of storage
in  the  geologic  reservoirs  is  needed?  What  is  the  time  span  of  post-injection  moni-
toring?  Much  work  needs  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  the  potential  large  and  rapid
scale-up in CCS deployment will be successful.

Underscoring  these  realities,  industrial  insurance  companies  point  to  this  lack  of
scientific  data  on  CO2 storage  as  one  reason  they  are  disinclined  to  insure  early
projects.  In  a  nutshell,  the  institutional  infrastructure  to  support  CO2 storage  does
not yet exist and will require time to develop. In addition, application of today’s CO2
capture  technology  would  significantly  increase  the  cost  of  an  IGCC  or  a  new  effi-
cient pulverized coal plant, calling into serious question regulatory approval for the
costs  of  such  a  plant  by  State  regulators.  Further,  recent  studies  sponsored  by  the
Electric  Power  Research  Institute  (EPRI)  suggest  that  application  of  today’s  CO2
capture  technology  would  increase  the  cost  of  electricity  from  an  IGCC  plant  by  40
to  50  percent,  and  boost  the  cost  of  electricity  from  a  conventional  pulverized  coal

plant  by  60  to  70  percent,  which  would  again  jeopardize  State  regulatory  approval
for the costs of such plants.

Despite these uncertainties, I believe that we must aggressively explore the viabil-
ity  of  CCS  technology  in  several  first-of-a-kind  commercial  projects.  AEP  is  com-
mitted to help lead the way, and to show how this can be done.

As described earlier in this testimony, AEP will install carbon capture controls on
two  existing  coal-fired  power  plants,  the  first  commercial  use  of  this  technology,  as
part of our comprehensive strategy to reduce, avoid or offset GHG emissions.

AEP  is  also  building  two  state-of-the-art  advanced  ultra-super-critical  power
plants  in  Oklahoma  and  Arkansas.  These  will  be  the  first  of  the  new  generation  of
ultra-super-critical  plants  in  the  U.S.  The  more  efficient  turbine  cycle  on  these
ultra-super-critical  units  results  from  increased  steam  temperatures  (greater  than
1100  °F).  This  improved  efficiency  reduces  fuel  (coal)  consumption  and  thereby  re-
duces emissions. The long-term goal for ultra-super-critical technology is to develop
‘‘super  alloys’’  which  can  withstand  operating  temperatures  of  1400  °F.  This  in-
creased  steam  temperature  will  improve  efficiency  by  about  20  percent  relative  to
today’s super-critical units that are operating in the 1000 °F to 1050 °F range.

AEP  is  also  advancing  the  development  of  IGCC  technology.  IGCC  represents  a
major breakthrough in our work to improve the environmental performance of coal-
based  electric  power  generation.  AEP  is  in  the  process  of  permitting  and  designing
two of the earliest commercial scale IGCC plants in the Nation. Construction of the
IGCC plants will start once traditional rate recovery is approved.

AEP  is  also  a  founding  member  of  FutureGen,  a  ground-breaking  public-private
collaboration that aims squarely at making near-zero-emissions coal-based energy a
reality.

FutureGen  is  a  $1.5  billion,  10-year  research  and  demonstration  project.  It  is  on
track to create the world’s first coal-fueled, near-zero emission electricity and hydro-
gen plant with the capability to capture and sequester at least 90 percent of its car-
bon dioxide emissions.

As an R&D plant, FutureGen will stretch—and indeed create—the technology en-
velope.  Within  the  context  of  our  fight  to  combat  global  climate  change,  FutureGen
has  a  truly  profound  mission—to  validate  the  cost  and  performance  baselines  of  a
fully integrated, near zero-emission coal-fueled power plant.

The design of the FutureGen plant is already underway, and we are making great
progress.  The  plant  will  be  on-line  early  in  the  next  decade.  By  the  latter  part  of
that decade, following on the advancements demonstrated by AEP, FutureGen, and
other projects, CCS technology should become a commercial reality.

It is when these technologies are commercially demonstrated, and only then, that
commercial  orders  will  be  placed  on  a  widespread  basis  to  implement  CCS  at  coal-
fueled power plants. That is, roughly around 2020. Widespread deployment assumes
that a host of other important issues have been resolved, and there is governmental
and public acceptance of CCS as the proven and safe technology that we now believe
it  to  be.  AEP  supports  rapid  action  on  climate  change  including  the  enactment  of
well  thought-out  and  achievable  legislation  so  that  our  nation  can  get  started  on
dealing with climate change. However, the development of technology must coincide
with any increase in the stringency of the program.

A huge challenge that our society faces over the remainder of this century is how
we  will  reduce  the  release  of  GHG  emissions  from  fossil  fuels.  This  will  require
nothing  less  than  the  complete  re-engineering  of  the  entire  global  energy  system
over  the  next  century.  The  magnitude  of  this  task  is  comparable  to  the  industrial
revolution,  but  for  this  revolution  to  be  successful,  it  must  stimulate  new  tech-
nologies  and  new  behaviors  in  all  major  sectors  of  the  world  economy.  The  benefits
of projects like FutureGen and the ones AEP is pursuing will apply to all countries
blessed with an abundance of coal, not only the United States, but also nations like
China and India.

In  the  end,  the  only  sure  path  to  stabilizing  GHG  concentrations  over  the  long-
term  is  through  the  development  and  utilization  of  advanced  technologies.  And  we
must  do  more  than  simply  call  for  it.  Our  nation  must  prepare,  inspire,  guide,  and
support  our  citizens  and  the  very  best  and  the  brightest  of  our  engineers  and  sci-
entists;  private  industry  must  step  up  and  start  to  construct  the  first  commercial
plants; and our country must devote adequate financial and technological resources
to this enormous challenge. AEP is committed to being a part of this important proc-
ess,  and  to  helping  you  achieve  the  best  outcome  at  the  most  reasonable  cost  and
timelines  possible.  Thank  you  again  for  this  opportunity  to  share  these  views  with
you.

STATEMENT OF MR. STUART M. DALTON, DIRECTOR,

GENERATION, ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE

Mr.  DALTON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you  to  the  Com-
mittee, and thank you for having EPRI here for the testimony. For
those  of  you  that  don’t  know,  EPRI  is  a  nonprofit  R&D  organiza-
tion,  with  operational  headquarters  in  California,  but  with  prin-
cipal operations also in Tennessee and in North Carolina.

I would like to summarize just a couple of brief points, and then
elaborate  briefly.  Recent  EPRI  work  shows  that  reduction  of  CO2
from the electricity sector will require a portfolio of technologies of
all  sorts,  not  just  capture  and  storage.  Efficiency  improvements,
which  we  haven’t  talked  about  much  yet  today,  includes  post-gen-
eration  and  can  be  implemented  in  both  new  and  existing  plants.
CO2 capture  and  storage,  which  we  have  talked  about,  will  be  an
important CO2 reduction method, but there is no silver bullet tech-
nology, and it will not be easy or cheap.

Accelerated R&D is needed in all types of coals and technologies,
as well as for large-scale storage of CO2 to prove effectiveness. And
finally,  policy  and  research  needs  to  match  this  accelerated  ap-
proach to efficiency enhancements, CO2 capture and storage.

To  expand  on  these  briefly,  recent  analytical  work  by  EPRI  esti-
mates that in order to significantly reduce CO2 from the electricity
sector,  the  U.S.  will  need  to  improve  efficiency  of  electric  trans-
mission,  and  use  efficiency,  renewables,  nuclear,  as  well  as  im-
provements  in  coal  and  capture  and  storage,  a  lot  of  it  is  to  the
subject of today’s hearing.

There  is  no  single  silver  bullet,  but  there  is  a  veritable  arsenal
of  technology  being  developed  worldwide  that  needs  to  be  dem-
onstrated and deployed. Multiple coal technologies with carbon cap-
ture  and  storage  will  need  to  be  demonstrated  across  the  range  of
U.S.  applications.  Our  projects,  and  those  of  others,  are  that  coal
will  continue  to  be  used,  and  that  we  will  need  to  optimize  effi-
ciency  and  CO2 capture  and  storage  as  a  major  part  of  the  overall
CO2 reduction program.

Existing  and  new  plants  can  improve  efficiency,  and  reduce  CO2
per  megawatt-hour,  per  unit  of  power  produced,  by  a  variety  of
equipment  and  operational  changes.  Some  of  these  can  be  accom-
plished  through  operational  minor  equipment  changes.  Some  will
require  significant  modifications  in  their  equipment.  All  types  of
coal-based  generation  are  capable  of  improving  efficiency  for  new
units.  Significant  programs  are  underway  in  the  U.S.  with  regard
to  that.  Over  the  next  20  years,  we  believe  the  improvements  can
achieve  CO2 reductions  of  up  to  20  percent  per  megawatt-hour
without  additional  CO2 capture.  The  MIT  Future  of  Coal  report,
the National Coal Council upcoming report, both lead to this same
sort of measure.

It  will  require  a  sustained  R&D  effort  and  substantial  invest-
ment in demonstration facilities. One example, the DOE Energy In-
dustries  of  Ohio,  Oakridge  National  Lab,  EPRI,  as  well  as  the
equipment suppliers, have been working on next generation super-
alloys for some years, but there is no demonstration path going for-
ward  at  this  point  toward  an  ultrasupercritical  coal  technology  of
the advanced type in the U.S., as there is in Europe.

Technical  barriers  to  reduce  CO2 include  cost  and  energy,  use  of
capture,  and  the  assurance  of  safe  storage,  as  we  have  talked
about. We believe CCS costs and barriers can be overcome through
a  joint  public  and  private  research  development  demonstration  ef-
fort.

We believe that they can be integrated into all types of new coal
power  plants,  combined  cycles,  IGCCs,  pulverized  coal,  fluidized
bed  combustion,  oxyfuel,  and  that  demonstrations  are  vital.  In  our
opinion,  no  advanced  coal  technology  is  economically  preferred  for
adopting  CCS.  When  you  add  capture,  it  becomes  a  horse  race,  in
our opinion.

If you use today’s technology to capture, compress, transport, and
store,  you  may  see  a  cost  increase  of  pulverized  coal  plants  of  60
to  80  percent,  40  to  50  percent  for  an  IGCC  plant,  in  our  esti-
mation.  With  an  aggressive  research  and  development  demonstra-
tion program, these costs can be brought down. Sites for long-term
storage  are  regionally  available  throughout  the  U.S.,  yet  there  are
major  challenges  to  overcome,  as  you  have  heard.  Specifically,  we
believe large-scale, greater than one million tons a year demonstra-
tions, need to commence as soon as possible, and the legal and reg-
ulatory framework needs to be established for long-term ownership
and liability.

We believe there are gaps in the policy toward, to quickly pursue
this  research,  but  primarily,  policy  toward  establishing  long-term
liability  for  CO2 storage  when  proper  safeguards  are  in  place.  We
believe  there  are  pathways  for  this,  and  that  industry  and  govern-
ment  need  to  act  now  to  move  this  forward  to  improve  efficiency,
capture, and guiding principles for storage.

Thank you very much.

nessee. EPRI appreciates the opportunity to provide testimony to the Committee on
the topic of ‘‘Prospects for Advanced Coal Technologies: Efficient Energy Production,
Carbon Capture and Sequestration’’

I  want  to  focus  my  comments  today  on  three  subjects:  (I)  the  technological  chal-
lenges  our  country  faces  in  limiting  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  from  power
plants that use coal as an energy source through both efficiency gains and CO2 cap-
ture  and  sequestration  (2)  policy  and  research  gaps  where  we  believe  the  federal
government can do more to facilitate the reduction of CO2 emissions from coal, and
(3)  highlights  from  recent  EPRI  analytical  work  that  emphasizes  the  importance  of
advanced coal technologies as part of an overall low-cost, low-carbon portfolio of op-
tions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with climate change.
Background

Coal  is  the  energy  source  for  over  half  of  the  electricity  generated  in  the  United
States,  and  numerous  forecasts  of  future  energy  use  show  that  coal  will  continue
to have a dominant share in our electric power generation for the foreseeable future.
Coal  is  a  stably  priced,  affordable,  domestic  fuel  that  can  be  used  in  an  environ-
mentally  responsible  manner.  Over  the  past  three  decades,  development  and  appli-
cation  of  advanced  pollution  control  technologies  and  sensible  regulatory  programs
have  reduced  emissions  of  criteria  air  pollutants  from  new  coal-fired  power  plants
by more than 90 percent. And by displacing otherwise needed imports of natural gas
or  fuel  oil,  coal  helps  address  America’s  energy  security  and  reduces  our  trade  def-
icit with respect to energy.

By 2030, according to the Energy Information Administration, the consumption of
electricity  in  the  United  States  is  expected  to  be  approximately  40  percent  higher
than current levels. At the same time, to responsibly address the risks posed by po-
tential  climate  change,  we  must  substantially  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions
intensity of our economy in a way which allows for continued economic growth and
maintains the benefits that energy provides. This is not a trivial matter—it implies
a  substantial  change  in  the  way  we  produce  and  consume  electricity.  Because  coal
contains  a  higher  percentage  of  carbon  than  other  fossil  fuels  such  as  natural  gas,
and  because  this  carbon  is  emitted  as  CO2,  coal  presents  a  greater  challenge  to
achieving reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

Technologies to reduce CO2 emissions from coal will necessarily be one part of an
economy-wide solution that includes greater end-use efficiency, increased renewable
energy,  more  efficient  use  of  natural  gas,  expanded  nuclear  power,  and  similar
transformations  in  the  transportation,  commercial,  industrial,  and  residential  sec-
tors  of  our  economy.  In  fact,  our  work  at  EPRI  on  the  impacts  of  climate  policy  on
technology  development  and  deployment  has  consistently  shown  that  non-emitting
technologies for electricity generation will likely be less expensive than technologies
for limiting emissions of direct fossil fuel end uses in other sectors.

EPRI  stresses  that  no  single  advanced  coal  generating  technology  (or  any  gener-
ating  technology)  has  clear-cut  economic  advantages  across  the  range  of  U.S.  appli-
cations.  The  best  strategy  for  meeting  future  electricity  needs  while  addressing  cli-
mate change concerns and economic impact lies in developing multiple technologies
from which power producers (and their regulators) can choose the option best suited
to  local  conditions  and  preferences.  Assuring  timely,  cost-effective  coal  power  tech-
nology with CO2 capture entails simultaneous and substantial progress in research,
development  and  demonstration  (RD&D)  efforts  to  improve  capture  processes  and
fundamental  plant  systems.  EPRI  sees  the  need  for  government  and  industry  to
pursue  these  and  other  pertinent  RD&D  efforts  aggressively  through  significant
public  policy  and  funding  support.  Early  commercial  viability  will  likely  come  only
through  firm  commitments  to  the  necessary  R&D  and  demonstrations  and  through
collaborative arrangements that share risks and disseminate results.

Improvements  and  new  development  in  several  technology  areas  are  required  to
achieve large scale reduction of CO2 emissions from coal power plants. These needs
can be described in three major aspects:

• Substantially increased thermodynamic efficiency of coal plants
• Cost-effective,  efficient,  commercially  available  technologies  for  capture  of
• Cost-effective, commercially available technologies for storage of captured CO2
Each  of  these  areas  presents  substantial  technology  challenges  requiring  a  sus-

CO2 from coal plants

tained investment in RD&D.
Increasing Coal Plant Efficiency

Although the United States was an early leader in developing high-efficiency coal
plant designs, we have built very few new coal power plants in the last two decades

and  are  now  playing  catchup  in  the  world  race  to  achieve  high-efficiency  designs.
In  the  1950s  and  ‘60s,  the  United  States  was  the  world’s  pioneer  in  power  plants
using  thermodynamically  efficient  ‘‘super-critical’’  and  ‘‘ultra-super-critical’’  steam
conditions.  Exelon’s  coal-fired  Eddystone  Unit  1,  in  service  since  1960,  still  boasts
the  world’s  highest  steam  temperatures  and  pressures.  Because  of  reliability  prob-
lems  with  some  of  these  early  units,  U.S.  designers  retreated  from  the  highest
super-critical  steam  conditions  until  recently  when  international  efforts  involving
EPRI  and  U.S.,  European  and  Japanese  researchers  concentrated  on  new,  reliable
materials  for  high-efficiency  pulverized  coal  plants.  Given  the  prospect  of  potential
CO2 regulations  (and  efforts  by  power  producers  to  demonstrate  voluntary  CO2 re-
ductions), the impetus for higher efficiency in future coal-based generation units has
gained  economic  traction  worldwide.  In  fact,  the  majority  of  new  pulverized  coal
(PC) plants announced over the last two years will employ high-efficiency super-crit-
ical  steam  cycles,  and  several  will  use  the  ultra-super-critical  steam  (USC)  condi-
tions with very high temperature, high efficiency designs heretofore used only over-
seas (aside from Eddystone).

EPRI is working with the Department of Energy, the Ohio Coal Development Of-
fice  and  major  equipment  suppliers  on  an  important  initiative  to  qualify  a  whole
new  class  of  nickel-based  ‘‘super-alloys,’’  which  will  enable  maximum  steam  tem-
peratures to rise from an ultra-super-critical steam temperature of 1100°F to an ‘‘ad-
vanced’’ ultra-super-critical steam temperature of 1400°F.

Combined  with  a  modest  increase  in  steam  pressure,  this  provides  an  efficiency
gain that reduces a new plant’s carbon intensity (expressed in terms of tons of CO2
emitted  per  megawatt-hour  [Tons/MWh])  by  about  20  percent  relative  to  today’s
state-of-the-art  plants.  Even  modest  increases  in  steam  conditions  can  raise  effi-
ciency  by  several  percent  in  the  near-term  (a  two  percent  increase  in  efficiency,  for
example,  represents  a  roughly  five  percent  reduction  of  CO2 production  and  coal
use). If capture of the remaining CO2 is desired, improved efficiency will also reduce
the required size of the capture equipment and the amount of coal mined and trans-
ported.

However,  realization  of  this  opportunity  will  not  be  automatic.  In  fact,  it  will  re-
quire  a  renewed,  sustained  R&D  commitment  and  substantial  investment  in  dem-
onstration  facilities  to  bring  new  technologies  to  market.  The  European  Union  has
embraced such a strategy and is midway through its program to demonstrate a pul-
verized coal plant with 1300°F steam conditions, which was realistically planned as
a  20-year  activity.  Efficiency  improvements  will  also  be  important  for  other  coal
power  technologies.  The  world’s  first  super-critical  circulating  fluidized-bed  (CFB)
plant is currently under construction in Poland. Many new units in China are being
built  with  temperatures  and  efficiencies  higher  than  recent  U.S.  units,  as  the  cost
of fuel and environmental pressures rise.

The  greatest  increase  in  efficiency  for  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle
(IGCC) units will come from increases in the size and efficiency of the gas turbines
and  improvements  in  their  ability  to  handle  hydrogen  rich  ‘‘syngas’’  that  would  be
produced in IGCC plants designed for CO2 capture.

A  number  of  technologies  are  being  developed  that  promise  to  decrease  the
amount  of  CO2 per  unit  of  power  produced  (e.g.,  pounds  CO2/kWh  or  Tons/MWh).
With  today’s  technology,  a  modern  pulverized  coal  plant  and  a  modern  coal-based
IGCC plant would produce roughly the same amount of CO2/kWh. Neither achieves
CO2 capture  without  significant  operational  and  hardware  modifications  and  some
loss  of  efficiency.  Both  are  expected  to  achieve  efficiency  advances  and  cost  reduc-
tions  based  on  research  and  development  occurring  worldwide.  EPRI  believes  that
both  industry  and  the  government  should  support  the  development,  demonstration,
and  deployment  of  multiple  high-efficiency  technologies  for  the  future,  rather  than
picking technology winners.
CO2 Capture Technology

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies can be feasibly integrated
into virtually all types of new coal-fired power plants, including IGCC, PC, CFB and
variants  such  as  oxy-fuel  combustion.  For  those  constructing  new  plants,  it  is  un-
clear which type of plant would be economically preferred if it were built to include
carbon  capture.  All  can  have  relative  competitive  advantages  under  various  sce-
narios.

A  utility’s  choice  between  these  technologies  will  depend  on  available  coals  and
their  physical-chemical  properties,  desired  plant  size,  the  CO2 capture  process  and
its  degree  of  integration  with  other  plant  processes,  plant  elevation,  the  value  of
plant co-products, and other factors. For example, IGCC with CO2 capture generally
shows  an  economic  advantage  with  low-moisture  bituminous  coals.  For  coals  with
high  moisture  and  low  heating  value,  such  as  sub-bituminous  and  lignite  coals,  a

37

recent  EPRI  study  (report  1014510  available  publicly)  shows  PC  with  CO2 capture
as competitive with IGCC with CO2 capture. However, no single set of costs can rep-
resent  all  conditions.  In  addition  to  such  variables  as  coal  type  and  plant  design,
the  cost  of  electricity  will  also  vary  due  to  plant  location  and  the  type  of  financing
of the facility receives.
Post-combustion CO2 Capture

Although  carbon  dioxide  capture  appears  technically  feasible  for  all  coal  power
technologies,  it  poses  substantial  engineering  challenges  (requiring  major  invest-
ments in R&D and demonstrations) and comes at considerable cost. However, anal-
yses  by  EPRI  and  the  Coal  Utilization  Research  Council  suggest  that  once  these
substantial  investments  are  made,  the  cost  of  CCS  becomes  manageable  and,  ulti-
mately,  coal-based  electricity  with  CCS  can  be  cost  competitive  with  other  low-car-
bon generation technologies.

Post-combustion  CO2 separation  processes  (placed  after  the  boiler  in  the  power
plant) are currently used commercially in the food and beverage and chemical indus-
tries, but these applications are at a scale much smaller than that needed for power
producing  PC  or  CFB  power  plants.  These  processes  themselves  are  also  huge  en-
ergy  consumers,  and  without  investment  in  their  improvement,  they  would  reduce
plant  electrical  output  by  as  much  as  30  percent  creating  the  need  for  more  new
plants.

EPRI’s most recent cost estimates suggest that for PC plants, the addition of CO2
capture  using  amine  solvents  (the  most  highly  developed  technical  option  currently
available),  along  with  drying  and  compression,  pipeline  transportation  to  a  nearby
storage site, and underground injection, would add 60–80 percent to the net present
value  of  life  cycle  costs  of  electricity  (expressed  as  levelized  cost-of-electricity,  or
COE, and excluding storage site monitoring, liability insurance, etc.). With coal pro-
viding  ∼50  percent  of  U.S.  electricity  generation,  this  translates  into  a  potentially
significant increase in consumers’ electric bills.
Oxy-firing

For PC plants, the introduction of oxy-fuel or oxy-coal combustion may allow fur-
ther  reductions  in  CO2 capture  costs  by  allowing  the  flue  gas  to  be  compressed  di-
rectly, without any CO2 separation process while also allowing the size of the super-
critical steam generator to be reduced. Boiler suppliers and major European and Ca-
nadian  power  generators  are  actively  working  on  pilot-scale  testing  and  scale-up  of
this  technology.  AEP  has  recently  announced  plans  to  study  use  of  this  ‘‘oxy-coal’’
technology  for  retrofitting  an  existing  plant,  and  SaskPower  (Saskatchewan  Power)
has  announced  that,  Babcock  &  Wilcox  Canada  (B&W)  and  Air  Liquide  will  jointly
develop the SaskPower Clean Coal Project.
Pre-combustion CO2 Capture

CO2 separation  processes  suitable  for  IGCC  plants  are  used  commercially  in  the
oil  and  gas  and  chemical  industries  at  a  scale  closer  to  that  ultimately  needed,  but
their application necessitates deployment of modified IGCC plant equipment, includ-
ing  additional  chemical  process  steps  and  gas  turbines  that  can  burn  nearly  pure
hydrogen.

The COE cost premium for including CO2 capture in IGCC plants, along with dry-
ing, compression, transportation and storage, is about 40–50 percent. Although this
is  a  lower  cost  increase  in  percentage  terms  than  that  for  PC  plants,  IGCC  plants
initially  cost  more  than  PC  plants.  Thus,  the  bottom-line  cost  to  consumers  for
power from IGCC plants with capture may be comparable to that for PC plants with
capture,  depending  on  the  types  of  coal  used,  elevation  of  the  plant  and  other  site-
specific factors.

It should be noted that IGCC plants (like PC plants) do not capture CO2 without
substantial plant modifications, energy losses, and investments in additional process
equipment.  As  noted  above,  however,  the  magnitude  of  these  impacts  could  likely
be reduced substantially through aggressive investments in R&D. Historical experi-
ence  with  the  development  of  environmental  control  technologies  for  today’s  power
plants suggests that technological advances from ‘‘learning-by-doing’’ will likely lead
to  significant  cost  reductions  in  CO2 capture  technologies  as  the  installed  base  of
plants  with  CO2 capture  grows.  An  International  Energy  Agency  study  led  by  Car-
negie  Mellon  University  suggested  that  overall  electricity  costs  from  plants  with
CO2 capture could come down by 15 percent relative to the currently predicted costs
after about 200 systems were installed.

Furthermore,  despite  the  substantial  cost  increases  for  adding  CO2 capture  to
coal-based IGCC and PC power plants, their resulting cost-of-electricity is still usu-
ally less than that for natural gas-based plants at current and forecast natural gas
prices.

38

Engineering  analyses  by  EPRI,  DOE  and  the  Coal  Utilization  Research  Council
suggest that costs could come down faster through CO2 capture process innovations
or,  in  the  case  of  IGCC  plants,  fundamental  plant  improvements—provided  suffi-
cient  RD&D  investments  are  made.  EPRI  pathways  for  reduction  in  capital  costs
and  improvements  in  efficiency  are  embodied  in  two  companion  RD&D  Augmenta-
tion  Plans  developed  under  the  collaborative  CoalFleet  for  Tomorrow  program.  The
IGCC plan (Report No. 1013219) is publicly available, and the PC plan will be avail-
able later this year. Efforts toward reducing the cost of IGCC plants with CO2 cap-
ture will focus on adapting more advanced and larger gas turbines for use with hy-
drogen-rich  fuels,  lower-cost  oxygen  supplies,  improved  gas  clean-up,  advanced
steam cycle conditions and other activities.
CO2 Transportation and Geologic Storage

Geologic  sequestration  of  CO2 has  been  proven  effective  by  nature,  as  evidenced
by  the  numerous  natural  underground  CO2 reservoirs  in  Colorado,  Utah  and  other
western states. CO2 is also found in natural gas reservoirs, where it has resided for
millions of years. Thus, evidence suggests that depleting or depleted oil and gas res-
ervoirs, and similar ‘‘capped’’ sandstone formations containing saltwater that cannot
be made potable, are capable of storing CO2 for millennia or longer. Geologic seques-
tration as a strategy for reducing CO2 emissions is being demonstrated in numerous
projects around the world.

Three  relatively  large  projects—the  Sleipner  Saline  Aquifer  CO2 Storage  (SACS)
project  in  the  North  Sea  off  of  Norway;  the  Weyburn-Midale  Project  in  Saskatch-
ewan,  Canada  and  the  In  Salah  Project  in  Algeria—together  sequester  about  three
to four million metric tons of CO2 per year, which approaches the output of just one
typical  500  megawatt  coal-fired  power  plant.  With  17  collective  years  of  operating
experience, these projects suggest that CO2 storage in deep geologic formations can
be  carried  out  safely  and  reliably.  Furthermore,  CO2 injection  technology  and  sub-
surface  behavior  modeling  have  been  proven  in  the  oil  industry,  where  CO2 has
been  injected  for  35  years  for  enhanced  oil  recovery  (EOR)  in  the  Permian  Basin
fields  of  west  Texas  and  Oklahoma  and  in  other  U.S.  fields.  Regulatory  oversight
and community acceptance of injection operations are well established in those con-
texts.

Within  the  United  States,  DOE  manages  an  active  R&D  program,  the  Regional
Carbon Sequestration Partnerships, that is mapping geologic formations suitable for
CO2 storage  and  conducting  pilot-scale  CO2 injection  validation  tests  across  the
country. These tests, as well as most commercial applications for long-term storage,
will compress CO2 to a liquid-like ‘‘super-critical’’ state to maximize the amount that
can  be  stored.  Virtually  all  CO2 storage  will  be  at  least  a  half-mile  underground,
where the CO2 will be injected into a porous sandstone-like material saturated with
salty water. CO2 will be stored in locations with geologic seals to minimize the like-
lihood of any leakage to the atmosphere (which would defeat the purpose of seques-
tering the CO2 in the first place).

DOE’s  Regional  Carbon  Sequestration  Partnerships  represent  a  broad  collabora-
tion  of  public  agencies,  private  companies  and  non-profits;  they  would  be  an  excel-
lent  vehicle  for  conducting  larger  ‘‘near-deployment  scale’’  CO2 injection  tests  to
prove  specific  U.S.  geologic  formations,  which  EPRI  believes  to  be  one  of  the  keys
to  commercializing  CCS  for  coal-based  power  plants.  Evaluations  by  these  Regional
Partnerships and others suggest that enough geologic storage capacity exists in the
United  States  to  hold  several  centuries’  worth  of  CO2 emissions  from  coal-based
power  plants  and  other  stationary  sources.  However,  the  distribution  of  suitable
storage  formations  across  the  country  is  not  uniform:  some  areas  have  ample  stor-
age capacity whereas others appear to have little or none.

Thus,  CO2 captured  at  some  power  plants  would  require  pipeline  transportation
for  several  hundred  miles  to  reach  suitable  injection  locations,  which  may  be  in
other  states.  While  this  adds  cost,  it  does  not  represent  a  technical  hurdle  because
CO2 pipeline  technology  has  been  proven  in  oil  field  FOR  applications.  As  CCS  is
applied  commercially,  EPRI  expects  that  early  projects  would  take  place  at  coal-
based  power  plants  near  to  sequestration  sites  or  to  existing  CO2 pipelines.  As  the
number  of  projects  increases,  regional  CO2 pipeline  networks  connecting  multiple
sources and storage sites would be needed.

There is still much work to be done before CCS can implemented on a scale large
enough  to  significantly  reduce  CO2 emissions  into  the  atmosphere.  In  addition  to
large-scale demonstrations at U.S. geologic formations, many legal and institutional
uncertainties  need  to  be  resolved.  Uncertainty  about  long-term  monitoring  require-
ments,  liability  and  insurance  is  an  example.  State-by-state  variation  in  regulatory
approaches  is  another.  Some  geologic  formations  suitable  for  CO2 storage  underlie

39

multiple states. For private companies considering CCS, these various uncertainties
translate into increased risk.
The Promise of CCS

Recent  EPRI  work  has  illustrated  the  urgent  necessity  to  develop  CCS  tech-
nologies as part of the solution to satisfying our energy needs in an environmentally
responsible manner. Our recently released ‘‘Electricity Technology in a Carbon-Con-
strained  Future’’  study  suggests  that  with  aggressive  R&D,  demonstration  and  de-
ployment of advanced electricity technologies, it is technically feasible to slow down
and  stop  the  increase  in  U.S.  electric  sector  CO2 emissions,  and  to  then  eventually
reduce them over the next 25 years while simultaneously meeting the increased de-
mand  for  electricity.  Of  the  technologies  that  can  eventually  lead  to  reductions  in
CO2 emissions,  the  study  indicates  that  the  largest  single  contribution  would  come
from applying CCS technologies to new coal-based power plants coming on-line after
2020.

Many other U.S. and international climate models and reports have stressed that
CCS  is  a  vital  part  of  the  needed  technology  mix  in  any  carbon-constrained  future.
We believe action is needed now to assure we can meet these technological and cost
challenges.
R&D Gaps

A gap in the policy and RD&D area that EPRI believes needs to be addressed by
the U.S. industry and government is the funding of multiple capture, transport, and
storage  demonstrations  at  large  scale  (>1  million  metric  tons  per  year  of  CO2).
These  demonstrations  should  encompass  a  variety  of  coal  technologies  and  capture
processes,  and  should  be  conducted  in  multiple  regions,  using  varying  geologic  for-
mations. Monitoring will need to be conducted to assure long-term storage effective-
ness.

Engineering  analyses  by  EPRI,  DOE  and  the  Coal  Utilization  Research  Council
suggest that costs could come down faster through CO2 capture process innovations
or,  in  the  case  of  IGCC  plants,  fundamental  plant  improvements—provided  suffi-
cient RD&D investments are made. Combined with EPRI’s past experience in trans-
forming  science  into  deployed  technologies,  these  analyses  clearly  indicate  that  a
sustained  and  substantial  RD&D  investment  will  be  necessary  to  assure  the  avail-
ability  of  CCS  and  levels  of  coal  plant  performance  compatible  with  potential  CO2
policies.

EPRI  pathways  for  reduction  in  capital  cost  and  improvement  in  efficiency  for
IGCC  plants  are  embodied  in  an  RD&D  Augmentation  Plan  developed  under  the
CoalFleet for Tomorrow program. This figure shows how efficiency can be increased
over  the  next  two  decades  as  costs  are  decreased  in  constant  dollar  terms.  The  de-
tailed plans for this have been developed in our collaborative efforts with firms form
five  continents  and  over  60  participants.  A  similar  figure  appears  for  combustion
processes  and  shows  equally  impressive  efficiency  and  cost  gains.  Neither  of  these
can  be  realized  without  a  strong  commitment  to  research  development  and  dem-
onstration.

Efforts  toward  reducing  the  cost  of  IGCC  plants  with  CO2 capture  will  focus  on
adapting  more  advanced  and  larger  gas  turbines  for  use  with  hydrogen-rich  fuels,
lower-cost oxygen supplies, improved gas clean-up, advanced steam cycle conditions,
and more.

For  PC  plants,  the  progression  to  advanced  ultra-super-critical  steam  conditions
will steadily increase plant efficiency and reduce CO2 production. Improved solvents
are  expected  to  greatly  reduce  post-combustion  CO2 capture  process.  EPRI  is  work-
ing to accelerate the introduction of novel, alternative CO2 separation solvents with
much  lower  energy  requirements  for  regeneration.  Such  solvents—for  example,
chilled ammonium carbonate—could reduce the loss in power output imposed by the
CO2 capture process from about 30 percent to about 10 percent. At present, a small
pilot plant (five MW-thermal) for chilled ammonia is being designed for installation
at a power plant in Wisconsin later this year; success there would warrant a scale-
up  to  a  larger  pilot  or  pre-commercial  plant.  An  EPRI  timeline  (compatible  with
DOE’s  timeframe)  for  the  possible  commercial  introduction  of  post-combustion  CO2
capture follows.

The introduction of oxy-fuel combustion may allow further reductions in CO2 cap-
ture costs by allowing the flue gas to be compressed directly, without any CO2 sepa-
ration  process  and  reducing  the  size  of  the  super-critical  steam  generator.  Boiler
suppliers and major European and Canadian power generators are actively working
on pilot-scale testing and scale-up of this technology.

Assuring  timely,  cost-effective  coal  power  technology  with  CO2 capture  entails  si-
multaneous  and  substantial  progress  in  RD&D  efforts  on  improving  capture  proc-
esses  and  fundamental  plant  systems.  EPRI  sees  the  need  for  government  and  in-
dustry  to  pursue  these  and  other  pertinent  RD&D  efforts  aggressively  through  sig-
nificant  public  policy  and  funding  support.  Early  commercial  viability  will  likely
come  only  through  firm  commitments  to  the  necessary  R&D  and  demonstrations
and through collaborative arrangements that share initial risks and disseminate re-
sults.

The  urgent  need  to  establish  an  enhanced  RD&D  program  for  developing  ad-
vanced coal and carbon capture and storage technologies is further increased by the
likelihood  that,  as  is  typical  for  research,  unexpected  technical  challenges  will  sur-
face and require additional time, effort and funding to resolve.

Policy Gaps

Without incentives or regulatory requirements, or a market for CO2, CCS will not
be  chosen  based  on  economics.  In  addition  to  incentives  to  encourage  use  of  CCS,
the  State  and  Federal  governments  will  need  to  deal  with  the  issues  of  land  use,
ownership, and liability for CO2. This is perhaps the biggest unknown. No company

can take on unlimited liability—options will be needed to allow firms to make long-
term  commitments  to  the  technology.  Such  options  may  include  special  insurance
provisions,  State  or  federal  liability  provisions,  and  must  include  clarity  in  regu-
latory requirements for long-term storage of CO2. Models and current analogies lead
us,  and  many  in  the  industry,  to  believe  that  the  risk  should  be  manageable,  but
the unknowns of long-term liability makes this risk difficult to manage.
Conclusions

Our country does face significant technology challenges in limiting CO2 emissions
from coal and it will require multiple technological approaches for capture and mul-
tiple  storage  demonstrations  to  prove  the  cost,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  CO2
capture  and  storage.  These  must  be  pursued  in  the  near  future  to  provide  options
for CO2 capture and storage on timeframes compatible with potential policies.

Our research indicates that with proper support and an RD&D program sustained
over the coming decades, the technology for CCS can play a significant role in reduc-
ing  CO2 emissions  from  the  power  industry  to  meet  future  national  requirements.
Summary of Testimony

Coal  is  a  stably  priced,  affordable,  domestic  fuel  that  can  be  used  in  an  environ-
mentally  responsible  manner.  It  is  the  workhorse  of  the  U.S.  electricity  grid,  ac-
counting for more than half of all the power generated. Forecasts of future U.S. en-
ergy needs envision the continued predominance of coal in the electric power sector.
Thus,  technologies  to  reduce  CO2 emissions  from  coal-based  power  plants  must  be
part  of  the  set  of  solutions  to  climate  change  concerns.  For  the  electric  sector,  that
portfolio will also include improved efficiency in transmission and end use, increased
renewable  energy,  more  efficient  use  of  natural  gas,  and  expanded  nuclear  power.
Analogous  low-carbon  transformations  must  occur  in  the  economy’s  transportation,
commercial,  industrial,  and  residential  sectors.  Even  within  the  sub-sector  of  coal-
based  electricity,  EPRI  stresses  that  a  portfolio  of  advanced  coal  technologies  is
needed. No single technology has clear-cut economic advantages across the range of
U.S.  applications.  The  best  strategy  for  reducing  CO2 emissions  lies  in  developing
multiple technologies from which power producers (and their regulators) can choose
the option best suited to local conditions and preferences.

An often-cited step is improving the efficiency of new coal power plants. This can
achieve  CO2 reductions  of  up  to  20  percent  per  megawatt  hour  of  electricity  before
the  addition  of  any  dedicated  CO2 controls.  The  MIT  ‘‘Future  of  Coal’’  report  and
a  forthcoming  report  by  the  National  Coal  Council  endorse  this  fundamental  meas-
ure.  Realization  of  this  opportunity  will  require  a  sustained  R&D  commitment  and
substantial  investment  in  demonstration  facilities.  EPRI,  DOE,  Ohio  Coal  Develop-
ment Office, and equipment suppliers have a program in place.

EPRI  and  others  believe  that  CO2 capture  and  sequestration  (CCS)  technologies
for  coal-based  power  plants  will  be  an  indispensable  technology  for  achieving  the
deep  cuts  in  man-made  CO2 emissions  needed  to  stop,  and  ultimately  reverse,  at-
mospheric  build-up.  CCS  technologies  can  be  feasibly  integrated  into  all  types  of
new coal power plants, including integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), pul-
verized coal (PC), circulating fluidized-bed (CFB), and variants such as oxy-fuel com-
bustion.  No  advanced  coal  technology  is  economically  preferred  for  adopting  CCS,
and  the  field  of  CO2 capture  technology  options  is  evolving  quickly  at  small-scale,
but  large  demonstrations  are  vital.  Sites  for  long-term  geologic  storage  of  CO2 are
regionally  available  throughout  much  of  the  United  States.  Yet,  there  are  major
challenges  to  be  overcome—both  technically  and  in  terms  of  public  policy—before
geologic  storage  of  CO2 can  be  applied  at  the  broad  scale  needed.  Specifically,  mul-
tiple large-scale (>1 million tons) demonstrations need to commence as soon as pos-
sible. Legal and regulatory frameworks need to be established, particularly with re-
spect to long-term ownership and liability.

RD&D  pathways  to  success  have  been  established  collaboratively  by  EPRI,  DOE,
and  industry  groups.  The  RD&D  funding  needs  are  a  significant  step  up  from  cur-
rent  levels,  but  within  historical  percentages  for  government  agencies  and  private
industry.  Given  the  long  technology  development  and  deployment  lead  times  inher-
ent in capital intensive industries like energy, investment and policy decisions must
be  made  now  or  we  risk  foreclosing  windows  of  opportunity  for  technology  options
that we expect will prove tremendously valuable in a carbon-constrained future.

STATEMENT OF MR. GARDINER HILL, DIRECTOR, CCS

TECHNOLOGY, ALTERNATIVE ENERGY, BP

Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I feel honored to
be  invited  here  today  to  talk  about  CO2 capture  and  storage.  I  am
indeed  heartened  that  the  Science  and  Technology  Committee  is
holding  a  hearing  on  this  technology,  given  the  potential  it  has  to
play  a  critical  role  in  helping  address  the  climate  change  problem.
A  number  of  the  elements  of  CO2 geological  storage  have  been
practiced  for  over  30  years  in  activities  such  as:  Enhanced  Oil  Re-
covery  (EOR),  where  we  typically  use  CO2 to  inject  into  oil  res-
ervoirs  and  flush  more  oil  recovery;  in  the  gas  storage  operations,
where gas is stored underground, so we have availability and oper-
ability  of  the  gas  system;  and  in  acid  gas  injection  operations.
Something  on  the  order  of  20  million  tons  of  CO2 per  year  is  cur-
rently  injected  into  geological  formations  for  EOR,  so  we  already
have a lot of experience.

So, what have we learned about CO2 geological storage over this
time  and  through  subsequent  technology  R&D?  Well,  we  know  the
best rocks for CO2 storage are depleted oil and gas fields and deep
saline  formations.  Now,  these  are  layers  of  porous  rock,  typically
very deep, below a kilometer, and they are located under an imper-
meable  rock  known  as  a  caprock,  which  acts  as  a  seal  to  the  main
reservoir.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change,  the
IPCC, has estimated the technical potential for CO2 storage is like-
ly  to  exceed  2,000  gigatons  or  2,000  billion  tons  of  CO2,  with  the
largest capacity likely to exist in saline formations.

So,  given  that  today’s  CO2 emissions  are  approximately  24
gigatons  of  CO2 from  fossil  fuels,  geological  storage  has  the  capac-
ity to store about 70 to 100 years of all emissions from fossil fuels.
On the other hand, others have estimated that CCS has the poten-
tial  to  contribute  a  quarter  of  the  emission  reductions  required  to
address climate change, and in that scenario, you can envision 400
years of CCS storage.

In  addition,  a  critical  thing  to  remember  about  CCS  is  its  flexi-
bility and adaptability. And when CO2 is stored through the use of

45

an  EOR  operation,  as  I  discussed  earlier,  there  is  a  genuine  win/
win for the environment and energy security.

But what are the outstanding risks in the matter of CO2 storage?
Well, it turns out this is not dissimilar to today’s oil and gas indus-
try.  Local  health,  safety,  and  environmental  risks  associated  with
geological  storage  can  be  comparable  to  the  risks  of  current  activi-
ties, such as natural gas storage, EOR, and deep underground dis-
posal  of  acid  gas,  provided  best  practice  is  applied  in  four  keys
area.

The first one is site selection. The second one is the design of the
storage  and  the  operation  of  the  storage  facility.  The  third  one  is
putting  in  place  a  robust  monitoring  program  to  validate  your  un-
derstanding of the storage system, and the fourth one is site aban-
donment, so you have integrity and seal of that storage site.

Now,  over  and  above  these  four  areas,  there  are  two  critical
frameworks  I  think  are  necessary  to  have  managed  these  risks,
and ensure we have consistency in the way CO2 is stored. And one
is the important regulatory framework for CCS, and the second one
is  a  CO2 storage  site  certification  framework,  so  we  have  a  con-
sistent standard applied.

So, what are the things we should consider when selecting a stor-
age  site?  Well,  I  think  there  are  three  primary  things  to  bear  in
mind.  The  first  one  is  capacity.  Does  the  site  have  enough  space
to  store  a  large  amount  of  CO2?  The  second  one  is  injectivity.  Can
you  actually  get  the  CO2 in  the  rock  and  actually  fill  it  up?  And
the third one, importantly, is integrity. Will the site store the CO2
for the timeframe required?

So,  that  means  we  need  to  understand  the  competence  of  the
structure,  the  stratigraphic  trap,  you  need  to  understanding  the
faulting  within  geological  structure,  because  that  could  contribute
to  a  leak  or,  indeed,  compartmentalization  of  the  rocks,  you  don’t
get  access  to  all  the  pore  space.  You  need  to  understand  the  geo-
chemistry,  the  number  of  wells  you  need  to  store  the  CO2 and  the
design of the wells, so you have integrity for the life of the installa-
tion.  But  as  I  said  before,  a  key  element  is  the  performance  pre-
diction, and we have to have a monitoring and verification program
to validate the understanding of the storage site.

Now  storage,  secure  storage,  actually  increases  over  time,  and
that occurs through the interaction of four different trapping mech-
anisms.  Some  can  be  engineered  to  enhance  the  trapping,  and
hence, is important to understand the role that each of these mech-
anisms  play  when  selecting  a  storage  site.  So,  the  first  one,  as  I
have  mentioned,  is  structural  trapping,  where  you  have  an  imper-
meable  rock  above  the  formation,  which  actually  physically  traps
the CO2 moving up.

The second mechanism is called residual phase trapping. That is
simply  CO2 going  into  like  a  sponge.  You  have  a  sponge  you  have
in  your  bath  that  you  fill  with  water,  sinking  the  CO2 in  a  rock,
the  CO2 goes  into  the  pores  in  that  sponge  in  that  rock  and  gets
trapped  between  the  pore,  and  becomes  totally  immobile,  just  like
you can’t get the water out of the sponge unless you squeeze it.

The third one is solubility, and that is where your CO2 dissolves
in  water,  in  your  fizzy  water,  and  what  happens  is  the  density  of
that water increases, so that water, then, sinks to the bottom of the

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

46

reservoir,  and  can’t  possibly  come  out,  because  of  the  density  dif-
ference.

And  the  fourth  one  is  mineral  trapping,  and  that  is  where  the
CO2 reacts with some of the minerals in the formation, and you get
physical  hard  scales  forming,  so  it  is  physically  trapped  in  a  solid
form, and hence the security of storage increases with time.

So,  what  steps  remain  to  be  taken  so  we  can  design  long-term
carbon  sequestration  projects?  Well,  clearly,  technology  develop-
ment  must  continue,  and  has  an  important  role  to  play,  but  my
sense  is  the  time  is  now  right  to  embark  upon  large-scale  dem-
onstration  projects,  and  I  would  say  that  is  a  million  tons  or  more
per year projects. And it is important we demonstrate and we look
and  we  try  to  demonstrate  in  a  number  of  different  types  of  res-
ervoirs  in  different  locations.  And  we  need  to  truly  learn  by  doing
at scale.

This needs to be done in a managed way by something like a de-
ployment strategy, which is a framework or plan that is consistent
with  a  clear  objective  that  will  be  achieved  by  a  certain  point  in
time. We need to set a goal and put in place a plan to achieve the
goal,  being  clear  and  transparent  on  the  conditions  of  satisfaction
required  one  way,  so  we  can  secure  the  public’s  confidence  in  this
technology.

It  is  clear  we  need  to  put  in  place  regulations  and  policy  meas-
ures that will allow geological studies to happen. Industry needs a
regulatory  framework,  so  that  the  operating  conditions  are  clear,
and  industry  needs  a  policy  framework  so  we  can  define  the  nec-
essary  business  and  commercial  conditions  for  CO2 storage.  We
need  to  also  identify  and  remove  roadblocks  to  technology,  and  I
will give you two examples.

One roadblock, potentially, is what happens to any liability asso-
ciated with CO2 storage after a storage site is full and safely aban-
doned.  Another  example  could  be  who  owns  the  pore  space?  The
number of laws in the U.S. are unclear in some cases about owner-
ship of the very pore space in the rocks that will be used for storing
CO2.  So,  removing  these  barriers,  and  a  deployment  strategy  that
is  open  and  transparent,  with  the  appropriate  regulations,  I  think
are  really  important  to  convincing  public,  regulators,  and  govern-
ments  alike  that  CCS  is  a  safe  and  important  technology  to  help
solve climate change.

Ladies  and  gentlemen,  it  is  time  to  get  into  action.  It  is  time  to
get  on  with  the  job.  This  technology  is  available  now,  and  with
some  help,  we  can  make  it  happen  at  scale.  And  this  is  actually
being  demonstrated  today  by  BP,  who  have  announced  two  hydro-
gen  power  projects  which  will  utilize  CO2 capture  and  geological
storage to use carbon power from fossil fuels.

Thank you very much.

PREPARED STATEMENT OF GARDINER HILL

Chairman Lampson, Ranking Member Inglis, thank you for inviting me to testify
here  today  on  carbon  capture  and  sequestration.  I  am  Gardiner  Hill,  Director  of
CCS Technology at BP, and a petroleum and civil engineer by training.

For those of you who don’t know, BP has made a commitment to investing $8 bil-
lion  over  the  next  10  years  in  alternative  energy—including  wind,  solar,  and  fossil-
fuel  powered  power  plants  with  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  (CCS).  We  have

announced two projects using CCS—one in Scotland, the other at our Carson refin-
ery in California.

BP, and the oil and gas industry generally, has more than thirty years of experi-
ence  injecting  carbon  dioxide  in  oil  and  gas  reservoirs.  We  do  so  every  day  for  en-
hanced oil recovery-injecting CO2 into depleted oil reservoirs, recovering the remain-
ing  oil,  and  inevitably  leaving  CO2 behind.  In  other  words,  CO2 storage  is  a  tech-
nology  that  is  available  today  and  we  know  that  it  has  the  potential  to  play  a  sig-
nificant  role  in  helping  to  reduce  CO2 emissions  into  the  atmosphere,  helping  to
combat climate change.

My role today is to explain how CO2 stays underground. It is important to under-
stand  that  many  natural  geological  stores  of  CO2 have  been  discovered  under-
ground—often  by  people  looking  for  oil  and  gas.  In  many  cases,  the  CO2 has  been
trapped underground for millions of years in geological traps, plus CO2 is also found
indigenous  in  many  oil  and  gas  fields,  where  is  has  been  stored  underground  natu-
rally for millions of years. It is true that under certain circumstances, CO2 does leak
naturally from underground. Indeed the world’s natural carbonated mineral waters,
long  prized  and  bottled  for  drinking,  come  from  natural  CO2 sources.  The  reasons
why some rock formations trap the CO2 permanently and some do not are well un-
derstood  and  this  understanding  will  be  used  to  select  and  manage  storage  sites  to
minimize the change of leakage.

The best rocks for CO2 storage are depleted oil and gas fields and deep saline for-
mations. These are layers of porous rock, such as sandstone, more than half a mile
underground,  located  underneath  a  layer  of  impermeable  rock,  or  cap-rock,  which
acts  as  a  seal.  In  the  case  of  oil  and  gas  fields,  it  was  this  cap-rock  that  trapped
the oil and gas underground for millions of years.

Depleted  oil  and  gas  fields  are  the  best  places  to  start  storing  CO2 because  their

geology is well known, and they are proven traps.

Deep  saline  formations  are  rocks  with  pore  spaces  that  are  filled  with  very  salty
water—much saltier than seawater. They exist in most regions of the world and ap-
pear  to  have  a  very  large  capacity  for  CO2 storage.  However,  the  geology  of  saline
formations  is  currently  less  well  understood  than  that  of  oil  and  gas  fields  and  so
more  work  needs  to  be  done  to  understand  which  formations  will  be  best  suited  to
CO2 storage, but the potential appears to be huge!

So  why  does  CO2 stay  underground?  As  CO2 is  pumped  deep  underground  it  is
compressed  by  the  higher  pressures  and  becomes  essentially  a  liquid,  which  then
becomes trapped in the pore spaces between the grains of rock. The longer the CO2
remains  underground,  the  more  securely  it  is  stored.  There  are  four  different  ways
that CO2 gets trapped underground.

The  first  mechanism  is  called  structural  storage.  This  can  be  best  demonstrated
by BP’s joint venture with Sonatrach called In Salah, which is a natural gas devel-
opment  in  Central  Algeria.  At  In  Salah,  the  natural  gas  produced  from  the  deep
rock  formations  is  a  mixture  of  methane  (CH4)  and  CO2.  Once  it  reaches  the  sur-
face,  the  natural  gas  is  separated  into  methane  and  CO2.  The  Methane  gas  is
pumped  North  to  Europe,  while  the  CO2 is  pumped  deep  underground—back  into
the  rock  formations  from  which  the  natural  gas  was  originally  extracted.  One  mil-
lion  tons  per  year  of  captured  CO2 is  injected  and  stored  in  this  way.  When  it  is
pumped deep underground, it is initially more buoyant than water and will rise up
through  the  porous  rocks  until  it  reaches  the  top  of  the  formation  where  it  is
trapped  by  an  impermeable  layer  of  cap-rock,  such  as  shale  at  the  In  Salah  field.
The  cap-rock  that  kept  the  natural  gas  in  the  rock  formation  for  millions  of  years
keeps  the  liquid  CO2 stored  in  the  underground  reservoir.  The  wells  that  were
drilled  to  place  the  CO2 in  storage  can  be  sealed  with  plugs  made  of  steel  and  ce-
ment.

The second mechanism is where CO2 gets trapped in the rock pore space through
what  is  known  as  residual  trapping.  In  this  instance,  the  reservoir  rock  acts  like
a  tight,  rigid  sponge.  When  liquid  CO2 is  pumped  into  a  rock  formation,  much  of
it becomes stuck within the pore spaces of the rock and does not move.

The third mechanism is called dissolution storage. In this instance, CO2 dissolves
in  salty  water,  just  like  sugar  dissolves  in  tea.  The  water  with  CO2 dissolved  in  it
is  then  heavier  than  the  water  around  it  and  so  it  sinks  to  the  bottom  of  the  rock,
trapping the CO2 indefinitely.

And finally, the fourth mechanism is when CO2 dissolves in salt water, becoming
weakly acidic and reacting with the minerals in the surrounding rocks, forming new
minerals as a coating on the rock—much like shellfish use calcium and carbon from
seawater  to  form  their  shells.  This  process  effectively  binds  the  CO2 to  the  rocks,
trapping it there.

We have the technology and the knowledge to get started on storing carbon under-
ground.  BP,  in  partnership  with  Edison  Mission,  has  announced  a  CCS  project  at

our  Carson  refinery  in  Southern  California.  We  will  be  taking  petcoke,  a  refinery
byproduct,  and  gasifying  it.  The  resulting  hydrogen  will  be  used  to  power  a  500
megawatt  power  plant,  and  the  CO2 will  be  stored  underground,  probably  via  an
Enhanced  Oil  Recovery  process  (EOR),  which  is  the  mechanism  I  outlined  at  the
start of the testimony in which industry has over 30 years experience. We know that
CCS  is  part  of  the  solution  to  the  climate  change  problem,  i.e.,  ref.  IPCC  special
report and Princeton Wedges analysis, etc.—estimates are that CCS technology has
the  capability  to  contribute  around  a  quarter  of  the  emission  reductions  needed  to
get  to  environmental  stabilization.  We  have  the  technological  know-how  to  do  this,
we need the policy and regulatory framework to enable its deployment.

Thank you and I welcome any questions you may have.

DISCUSSION

CARBON SEQUESTRATION RISKS

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  We  will  now  begin
with  our  first  round  of  questions,  and  I  will  recognize  myself  for
five  minutes.  And  I  would  start  with  a  whole  bunch  of  questions
at  one  time,  if  you  will  forgive  me  for  doing  this,  and  do  them  as
best  you  can,  and  I  would  like  to  ask  Mr.  Bauer,  Dr.  Finley,  and
Mr. Hill to respond to these.

I  understand  that  CO2 storage  is  a  technology  that  is  available
today, as we have heard, and could play a significant role in reduc-
ing  CO2 emissions  into  the  atmosphere.  Do  we  know  what  the
probability  is  of  a  carbon  release  from  a  geological  site?  What  re-
search and data are available to understand the environmental and
human health and safety risks? Are there well established risk as-
sessment methodologies for geological storage of CO2? Let me start
with those, and then I am going to ask two more.

Dr.  FINLEY.  Well,  I  think  with  regard  to  the  probabilities  of  re-
lease,  I  think  yes,  there  is  a  probability  of  release.  It  is  very  dif-
ficult to quantify at this point in time. The natural gas storage in-
dustry has had many very safe and operational natural gas storage
facilities. For example, we have one in Champaign County, Illinois
that  stores  150  billion  cubic  feet  of  flammable  natural  gas  over  an
area  of  25  square  miles,  and  that  facility  has  been  in  place  since
the  early  1970s,  and  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  never  has  had
a leak to surface or a problem.

So,  we  have  some  analogies  out  there.  We  need  to  take  advan-
tage  of  those  analogies,  and  I  think  with  the  advent  of  the  large-
scale  testing  that  is  being  proposed  here,  and  that  we  are  moving
toward on the regional partnerships, it is really going to give us an
opportunity  to  put  in  place  a  series  of  sensors,  observation  wells,
and  the  like,  that  I  think  will  really  begin  to  try  and  take  this
largely  qualitative  understanding,  and  move  it  over  into  the  quan-
titative arena, as you suggest.

Mr.  BAUER.  I  would  agree  with  that,  and  I  think  Gardiner  Hill
did  a  great  job  of  describing  basically  what  a  reservoir  would  be,
which  is  really  not  a  void.  It  is  a  rock,  it  is  a  permeable  rock,  and
many  people  get  concerned  about  a  rapid  release,  but  from  a  per-
meable  rock,  it  doesn’t  just  spring  out  in  tremendous  force.  To  be
a  volcanic  void,  and  there  has  been  a  couple  incidents  in  history
recorded,  where  a  volcanic  void  erupted,  with  CO2 being  released
in  a  low-lying  area,  and  there  was  a  concern,  but  that  is  not  the
kind  of  capture  area,  plus  the  capstone  rock  being  very  important.

We do have data, the regional partnerships have done some great
things in the first two phases, at both analysis and collecting data,
but  the  third  phase,  which  we  are  entering  this  year,  is  to  do
projects towards the million ton per year level, and to catch, gather
greater  data  for  that.  On  the  area  of  risk  assessment,  there  are
abilities  to  do  risk  assessment.  The  application  to  this  particular
arena  is  not  really  done,  except  from  the  standpoint,  I  think,  and
Gardiner,  maybe  you  could  speak  to  the  EOR  and  the  risk  assess-
ments about there, that might be of enlightenment to you.

Mr.  HILL.  Thank  you  very  much.  I  think  this  is  all  about  risk
management,  actually.  And  the  way  we  approach  this  is  by  taking
fundamental  review  of  the  risks,  and  making  sure  these  are  man-
aged adequately. But let me start by saying there is a lot of experi-
ence.  I  mean,  there  is  many  examples  of  gas  storage,  which  is
clearly  more  dangerous  than  CO2,  because  of  the  increased  buoy-
ancy and the flammability of gas, many years of EOR, and indeed,
we actually have a number of CO2 natural gas fields that exist, or
CO2 natural  reservoirs  that  exist  in  the  U.S.,  that  primarily  are
used today for supplying CO2 for EOR.

So, we can actually go and look and study these CO2 natural res-
ervoirs  that  have  occurred  for  millions  of  years,  and  why  CO2 has
stayed  there  for  millions  of  years.  And  indeed,  we  have  done  stud-
ies  to  undertake  the  performance  of  the  natural  gas  storage  sys-
tem,  and  there  is  examples  in  Europe  where  there  is  a  very  large
natural gas storage system, actually under the City of Berlin itself.
So,  there  is  real  examples  of  where  gases,  like  CO2 and  perhaps
even  more  volatile,  are  actually  stored  in  fairly  public  places  very
safely and with a great track record.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Chairman LAMPSON. Okay. Let me interrupt you, because I have
got  50  seconds  left,  and  I  want  to  try  to  be  a  little  bit  better  on
my timing this time.

Let  me  ask  the  last  two  questions  of  you  for  this  particular  sec-
tion  for  me,  and  then,  I  will  catch  something  else  a  little  bit  later,
but  who  should  manage  and  monitor  the  sequestration  sites,  and
secondly,  does  the  EPA  have  good  regulatory  structure  in  place  to
adequately  address  the  review  and  oversight  necessary  for  large-
scale carbon sequestration?

Mr.  BAUER.  On  the  matter  of  who  should  regulate,  I  won’t  take
that  one  on  directly,  because  of  my  position,  but  we  are  working
with  the  EPA  to  put  in  information  and  to  prepare  regulatory  re-
quirements.  They  do  not  presently  have  one  of  sequestration,  they
do  have  it  for  injection  wells.  There  was  a  letter  of  guidance  re-
leased  March  7  of  this  year  from  EPA,  giving  direction  of  large-
scale  injection,  but  the  long-term  storage  is  not  framed  properly
yet.

Chairman LAMPSON. Dr. Finley or Mr. Hill, would you comment?
Dr. FINLEY. Yeah, I think, as Carl mentioned, yes, the U.S. EPA
has  issued  these  guidelines  looking  at,  classified  as  experimental
under  the  underground  injection  control  regulations,  as  a  place  to
start. I think the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission has

framework, because after all, under UIC, states that have primacy,

for example, do regulate as Class 2 the wells that deal with oil and
gas and EOR, which Gardiner has referred to.

So,  I  think  basically,  I  think  the  States  need  to  have  an  impor-
tant  role  in  it,  but  the  exact  framework  of  that  role  has  yet  to  be
defined.

Mr.  HILL.  Yes.  I  would  validate  that.  I  think  it  is  an  important
thing to tackle regulations, I think, when you take groups together,
to make sure we have the right people who can write the right reg-
ulations.

We are involved in helping, we would like to be involved in help-
ing  develop  these,  given  the  experience  we  have  through  EOR  and
through  CO2 storage,  like  in  Sowerfield,  where  we  are  injecting  a
million tons per year of CO2 which is stored annually.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you  very  much.  Ranking  Member

Inglis, recognized for five minutes.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION SITES

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Now,  I  am  a  commercial
real estate lawyer, not a scientist, which will become obvious in the
midst of these questions that I am about to ask.

But  one  of  the  things  you  say  in  real  estate,  you  know,  is  three
things  determine  the  value  of  real  estate,  location,  location,  loca-
tion.  And  so,  the  question  that  I  have  about  the  geological  forma-
tions  is  how  common  are  they,  and  are  they  located  in  places  that
are  usable?  I  mentioned  in  my  opening  statement  the  Duke  power
plant in South Carolina that may be a coal-fired plant. How readily
available  are  these  locations  for  the  kind  of  storage  that  we  are
talking?  Anybody  want  to,  whoever  wants  to  take  a  shot  at  that?
Dr. FINLEY. Well, I think, I mean it depends on the type of rocks.
I  was  in  Madison,  Wisconsin  two  weeks  ago,  and  listened  to  the
Wisconsin  State  geologist  proclaim  very  clearly  that  the  State  of
Wisconsin  has  very  limited  opportunity  to  store  carbon  dioxide  in
the  rock  framework.  I  am  afraid  that  is  also  the  case  for  much  of
the  Atlantic  coastal  plain,  which  you  represent  with  regard  to
South  Carolina.  I  got  my  Ph.D.  at  Columbia,  and  so,  I  have  some
knowledge of the geology of the State of South Carolina.

But basically, it is the rock framework, but that is not to say that
we are restricted locally within that rock framework, because after
all,  we  have  more  than  a  million  miles  of  natural  gas  pipelines  in
this  country  that  deliver  natural  gas  from  our  shore  of  the  Gulf  of
Mexico to the State of Maine, for that matter. So, basically, I think
what  can  be  adapted  is  find  the  places  where  the  geology  is  suit-
able, where it is safe and where it can be effective, and if you have
places  where  the  coal  resources  or  the  water  resources  are  avail-
able, such that power generation is appropriate there, then we can
build  an  infrastructure  to  move  the  CO2 to  where  it  can  be  safely
stored.

CARBON DIOXIDE TRANSPORTATION

Mr.  INGLIS.  So,  then,  we  would  likely  be  talking  about  moving
CO2, pipeline system. I guess a truck would not be effective, right,
because  there  is  a  lot  of  it,  so  you  got  to  move  it,  which  the  next
question  is,  is  the  other  thing  about  commercial  real  estate,  as  we

say,  you  know,  they  are  not  making  any  more  of  it,  which  makes
it valuable, real estate that is. And so, the question is how quickly
before  these  formations  are  used  up?  What  kind  of  capacity  do  we
have?

Mr.  BAUER.  Well,  I  think  as  Dr.  Finley  gave  in  his  testimony,
there  are  multiple  hundreds  of  years  of  geologic  storage  capacity
available.  It  goes  back  to  location.  They  may  not  be  always  avail-
able  where  you  are.  I  think  as  Gardiner  also  mentioned,  making
sure  you  have  a  sufficient  reservoir  when  you  start  to  meet  your
stand for longevity there, is also something to determine.

So, the bottom line is there is plenty of storage available. The ge-
ographic  location  may  not  always  be  in  the  right  place.  You  may
have  to  pipeline  to  it.  But  for  the  Nation,  about  97  percent  of  the
areas that use coal power today have geologic storage within a rea-
sonable  distance,  50  to  100  miles,  at  maximum,  to  be  pipelined,
many times, even right below a facility presently.

Mr.  HILL.  Can  I  just  add  to  that?  I  think  this  is  actually  a  vol-
ume  issue,  and  that  if  CCS  is  to  make  a  contribution  to  climate
change,  then  we  are  actually  talking  about  huge  volumes,  and  in
my  statement,  I  said  it  could  contribute  up  to  a  quarter  of  the  re-
ductions  required  to  help  stabilize  emissions.  Now,  even  a  quarter
contribution  is  something  like  equivalent  to  125  million  barrels
equivalent of oil, so that is an industry big as the oil industry. Cur-
rently  the  oil  industry  is  about  18  million  barrels  per  day,  so  if
CCS  is  doing  only  a  quarter  of  the  reductions  required  emissions,
you are talking a business, an infrastructure, at least equivalent at
least equivalent to these oil industry, so it will be a big infrastruc-
ture requirement. At times, there are a number of oil and gas fields
that are very suitable to store CO2, but there is actually a lot larg-
er  capacity  in  these  deep  saline  formations,  which  turn  out  to  be
quite extensive across the U.S., and in fact, most of the world.

Mr.  RENCHECK.  I  would  like  to  add  on  that,  regional  partner-
ships,  the  importance  of  continuing  the  drilling  into  the  saline
aquifers.  While  we  understand  a  lot  about  the  oil  formations  and
gas  formations,  these  rock  structures  in  some  cases  are  9,000  feet
below  the  surface.  At  our  Mountaineer  Plant,  we  participated  in
the  drilling  of  that,  understanding  the  geology,  and  we  think  we
need  to  do  more  of  that,  so  we  understand  the  geology  at  those
deep levels.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION ATLAS

Mr. INGLIS. I have more questions, but my time is almost up. Mr.
Bauer, just to make sure, how much, you said within 50 miles, we
have what percent of the capacity?

Mr.  BAUER.  When  we  did  the  Atlas,  which  Dr.  Finley  held  up,
and  I  have  a  couple  digital  versions  I  would  be  glad  to  leave  with
the  Committee,  it  identified  that  there  were  plenty  of  reservoirs,
and  the  regional  partnerships  cover  about  97  percent  of  the  land
mass of the United States, which also happens to coincide to about
97  percent  of  the  power  plant  areas,  and  well  within  that  realm,
there  is  pretty  much  sequestration  availability  for  most  of  those
plants within a reasonable transmission framework, and going with
what Gardiner said, we are talking mainly with saline aquifers, as

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

well  as  oil  and  gas  fields  that  would  be  expended  or  used  for  EOR
before expending.

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Costello, you are recognized.

CCS TECHNOLOGY READINESS

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Mr.  Chairman,  thank  you,  and  I  thank  all  of  the

witnesses for their thoughtful testimony.

I  would  like  to  try  and  clarify  a  few  points,  and  then,  ask  a  few
questions as well. One is that I think it is important to clarify that
while CCS technology will enable our power plants to operate more
efficiently,  and  enable  them  to  not  only  operate  more  efficiently,
but reduce emissions, that there are legitimate reasons why utility
companies  and  the  coal  industry  are  not  using  the  technology
today,  and  until  the  technology  is  ready  to  be  deployed  on  a  com-
mercial scale basis, I believe that a mandate from Congress to cap-
ture  and  store  all  carbon  dioxide  underground  will,  in  fact,  shut
down coal plants across the country, which will, of course, drive up
consumer  electricity  bills,  and  convert  existing  power  plants  to
burn natural gas.

Given the volatility of the oil and gas market, and the instability
in the Middle East and the rising cost of oil and natural gas, I be-
lieve  we  should  reject  policies  which  move  us  toward  greater  de-
pendence  on  foreign  sources  of  energy,  and  instead,  embrace  poli-
cies  and  encourage  the  use  of  our  domestic  resources,  such  as  ad-
vanced clean coal technology demonstration projects.

The figures that I have from the Energy Information Administra-
tion in May of 2007, the cost per million Btu of oil is $7.66 per mil-
lion  Btus.  Natural  gas  is  $7.53,  and  coal  is  $1.73,  so  I  think  it  is
very evident, the cost differences in oil versus natural gas and coal.
Today’s  hearing,  of  course,  has  shed  some  light  on  some  of  these
issues, and also, brings out the fact that there are significant chal-
lenges  to  overcome,  such  as  the  readiness  of  the  technology,  the
capital  costs  and  long-term  liability  issues,  which  was  touched  on,
and I think that we in the Congress must first address these issues
before we can implement a CCS technology mandate.

With  that,  I  would  like  to  pose  a  few  questions,  and  to  try  and
clarify a few points. And Mr. Hill, in particular, I read your written
testimony,  and  you  state  that  carbon  dioxide  storage,  also  known
as  sequestration,  is  a  technology  that  is  available  today,  and  I
wanted  to  clarify  a  point,  and  to  make  certain  that  I  understand,
that  you  are  referring  to  carbon  sequestration  technology  for  en-
hanced oil recovery. Is that correct?

Mr. HILL. No, I am not only referring to oil recovery. I think the
technology for storing CO2 in oil and gas reservoirs independent of
enhanced  oil  recovery  is  available  today,  and  I  could  point,  I  can
point  to  the  two  well  examples  of  where  that  occurs.  Under  the
North  Sea,  the  Sax  Formation  has  been  storing  a  million  tons  per
year  of  CO2 for  ten  years,  and  the  Dust  Development  in  Salah.  It
is  also  storing  a  million  tons  of  CO2 per  year  in  the  bottom  of  a
gas reservoir.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Now,  is  anyone  currently  capturing  CO2 under-

ground, on a full, large-scale basis in the United States?

Mr. HILL. I am not aware of a full-scale application in the United

States.

Mr. COSTELLO. Any of the other witnesses like to comment?
Dr. FINLEY. There is a plant in North Dakota that captures, from
gasification,  not  from  power  production,  but  from  gasification  of
coal,  about  2.7  million  tons  a  year,  and  it  is  shipped  north  to  an
enhanced  oil  recovery,  and  there  is  some  testing  as  to  how  much
will stay in that oil recovery field. So, that is one application.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Let  me,  there  is  a  bit  of,  we  have  a  briefing  for
Members  on  the  issue  of  coal  and  some  of  the  challenges  that  we
have,  and  in  sum,  people  believe  that  the  technology  on  a  large-
scale  commercial  basis  is  available  today.  Others  say  that  it  won’t
be  available  until  the  year  2020,  and  I  wonder  if,  in  particular,  if
any  of  the  witnesses  would  like  to  comment,  beginning  with  Dr.
Finley.

Dr. FINLEY. Well, I think that would be a little pessimistic, in my
view. I think, in view of the experience at, in Sleipner, which is the
North Sea project, and Salah in Algeria, and the Weyburn Project,
and the gas, natural gas storage, I think saying that we cannot do
this until 2020 would be, in my view, a bit conservative.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  But  would  you  agree  that  the  technology  is  not

on a commercial, full-scale basis, available?

Dr. FINLEY. Well, let me ask, are you speaking of the capture at
the power plant, versus the ability to put it in the ground? Capture
at the power plant is not available.

Mr. COSTELLO. Right.
Dr.  FINLEY.  That  is  correct.  Ability  to  put  it  in  the  ground  from
a  source,  such  as  the  Dakota  Plains  Gasification  Plant,  where  we
have  a  relatively  pure  stream  available,  that  technology  is  there.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  And  in  your  judgment,  Dr.  Finley,  how  long  will
it  be—of  course,  it  is  your—you  have  got  to  give  your  best  guess,
before  the  technology  is  available  to  capture  it  at  the  power  plant
on-site?

Dr.  FINLEY.  I  think  we  need  probably,  certainly,  perhaps,  six  to
ten  years  of  intensive  development  to  focus  on  that  capture,  basi-
cally  to  scale  up  some  of  the  processes  that  we  have  seen  today,
and make them widely available.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  Two  more  quick  questions,  before  I  run  out  of
time  here.  Would  you  agree  that  if,  in  fact,  the  Congress  enacted
a  mandate  to  capture  all,  and  to  sequester  underground,  all  CO2
emissions,  in  the  short-term,  that  that,  in  fact,  would  shut  down
most  of  the  coal-fired  plants  in  the  United  States  today,  and  force
them to convert to natural gas?

Dr. FINLEY. I think that would be a fair statement, yes.
Mr.  COSTELLO.  The  last  question,  and  I  would  love  to  hear  from
the  other  witnesses,  but  I  am  about  out  of  time.  Maybe  we  will
have a second round, but Dr. Finley, some have suggested to Mem-
bers  of  this  subcommittee  and  to  the  Congress  that,  I  have  heard
that  we  have  a  250  year  supply  of  coal.  Others  say  that  if  we  con-
tinue to use coal, and in fact, can sequester the CO2 and move for-
ward  in  using  additional  coal,  that  we  are  going  to  run  out  of  coal
in the short-term, and I wonder if you might give your estimate as
to the coal supply of the United States.

Dr.  FINLEY.  Well,  I  think  your  number  is  correct,  approximately
247  billion  tons  of  defined  reserves.  We  use  about  1.1  billion  tons
a  year,  so  that  number  is,  indeed,  very  close.  I  think  some  of  the

Sasol process, Sasol experience in South Africa suggests we can get
about  two  barrels  of  hydrocarbon  liquids  for  each  ton  of  coal.  I
think we could easily move to perhaps produce as much as two mil-
lion barrels per day of liquids from coal, and I still think we would
easily  have  100  years  of  coal  to  do  that,  in  addition  to  having  the
coal  available  for  electric  generation  that  we  would  need  over  the
next 100 years.

Mr.  COSTELLO.  I  thank  the  Chair  for  being  generous  with  my

time, and thank the witnesses.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Very  welcome.  We  will  get  you  back  some-

how. Mr. Neugebauer, you are recognized.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Well, I thank the Chairman, and like the dis-
tinguished  Ranking  Member,  he  is  a  real  estate  lawyer,  and  I  am
a  real  estate  developer,  so  I  don’t  know  if  I  am  going  to  be  able
to contribute much more than he did to this discussion.

I think I am going to start with a fundamental question and just
for  my  own  edification,  if  I  had  two  electric  power  plants  sitting
side by side, one of them using natural gas, and one of them using
coal,  what  is  the  ratio  of  CO2 being  emitted  by  those  two  plants?
Mr. Dalton.

Mr.  DALTON.  You  would  roughly  get  about  2,000  pounds  per
megawatt-hour  from  a  coal  plant,  conventional  design  or  gasifi-
cation  design,  without  capture.  And  you  would  roughly  get  about
800 pounds per megawatt-hour from a natural gas plant, combined
cycle.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. So, it is a substantial difference.
Mr. DALTON. Correct.
Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  And  so,  while  we  have  got  you  in  the  queue,
from  your  testimony,  my  impression  is  that  post-combustion  CO2
capture  not  only  reduces  the  output  of  pulverized  coal,  therefore,
adding to the cost, but also, adds to the cost, due to the additional
technology, transportation, and storage requirements. Is that accu-
rate?

Mr. DALTON. That is accurate. We estimate that both the energy
use  and  capture,  and  the  compression  energy,  primarily,  that  is
used  to  get  the  CO2 up  to  the  point  where  it  becomes  almost  like
a  liquid,  about  half  the  density  of  water,  it  is  transported  through
a  pipeline,  that  energy  can  roughly  run  from,  if  you  used  today’s
technology,  20  to  30  percent  of  the  overall  energy  of  the  plant.
Again,  we  are  looking  at  a  lot  of  new  technologies,  both  for  com-
pression and for capture, that will reduce that, but that is the kind
of range that we are looking at.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. So, I have got to have 120 percent more capac-
ity with that process, to produce about the same amount of energy,
without  it,  and  so,  and  at  the  same  time,  I  guess  I  am  creating
more CO2 to be dealt with.

Mr. DALTON. And you are using more coal, correct.
Mr. NEUGEBAUER. So, what—for that to be a viable option for the
future, what kind of research needs to begin to, or is research going
on to try to make that a more efficient process?

Mr.  DALTON.  There  is  research  going  on.  Carl  Bauer  referred  to
several pieces of that work that is going on. There is research going
on  on  both  the,  if  you  will,  the  chemical  plant  that  is  in  front  of
the power generation, which is gasification, and the chemical plant

55

that  is  in  the  back  of  a  more  conventional  plant,  to  capture  the
CO2. Unfortunately, we haven’t found anything yet that is the per-
fect  absorbent  material,  that  grabs  it  very  easily,  captures  it  very
easily, and then, when you want it to, wants to let it go very easily.
If  it  is  easy  on  the  capture  side,  it  doesn’t  tend  to  want  to  let  it
go,  and  this  is  what  takes  all  the  energy,  is  to  try  and  make  it  let
go of the CO2.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Yes, Mr. Rencheck.
Mr.  RENCHECK.  I  would  tell  you  that  we  are  working  on  dem-
onstration projects that would take those types of technologies that
Stu  was  talking  about  from  a  pilot  phase  to  an  advanced  phase,
and  we  are  hoping  to  get  the  energy  penalties  down  to  the  10  to
15  percent  range.  And  the  purpose  of  the  demonstration  is  to  do
it  at  scale,  and  understand  how  it  will  behave  on  the  back  of  the
plant.

We  are  also  looking  at  building  IGCC  plants  which,  in  order  to
advance that technology, we are going to have to build four or five,
six  of  these  plants  at  a  commercial  scale,  before  we  understand
how they can more efficiently and more effectively be utilized.

OTHER USES FOR CO2

Mr.  NEUGEBAUER.  Mr.  Finley,  you  indicated  in,  that  in  my  part
of the world, West Texas, we have been using CO2 for tertiary and
secondary  recovery  of  oil  very,  very  successfully,  and  I  assume
without much hazard to the environment and to the region. I guess
the  other  question  is,  what  kind  of  research  is  going  on  where  we
could,  rather  than  just  putting  this  CO2 in  the  ground  and  dis-
posing  of  it,  use  CO2 for  other  kinds  of  activities?  Is  any  of  that
kind of activity going on?

Mr.  BAUER.  Yes,  sir.  There  is  some  other  work  looking  at  using
CO2 for  more  rapid  plant  growth,  algae  growth,  taking  the  algae
as  a  quick  uptake  of  CO2,  and  then  converting  it  to  a  biodiesel.
There is a couple of different experiments around the country. Ari-
zona  Power  Service  is  doing  on  a  fairly  large  scale  off  of  a  plant,
and  they  are  moving  it  up  to  Four  Corners  area  right  now.  There
are  a  couple  others  I  am  aware  of,  where  they  use  a  pond  rather
than  a  bio-reactor,  and  those  seems  to  hold  promise,  although  the
magnitude of the CO2 generated across the Nation, that would only
be one of the tools, it would not solve the problem totally. But they
are looking at using CO2 as a working fluid, to capture energy and
move  it  elsewhere,  and  in  fact,  even  oxy-combustion  plants  pre-
viously  mentioned,  looked  at  recycling  CO2 as  part  of  the  working
fluid in operating the plant and keeping it cooler.

Mr. NEUGEBAUER. I thank you and thank the Chairman.
Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Neugebauer.  Ms.  Giffords,

you are recognized.

WESTERN REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I realize I wasn’t here
for the earlier questions and some of the testimony, but I hail from
the  great  State  of  Arizona,  where  90  percent  of  our  electricity  in
the City of Tucson is generated from coal.

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

56

Over 50 percent of our state’s energy is generated from coal, but
we are the fastest growing state in the Nation, and new coal plants
are  being  proposed  for  Southern  Arizona  and  across  the  State  as
well.

I  would  like  to  see  Arizona  transition  from  coal  to  clean,  renew-
able  energy.  However,  I  recognize  that  for  the  foreseeable  future,
that  carbon  capture  and  sequestration  could  help  us  reduce  emis-
sions  in  the  meantime.  So,  I  am  curious  to  the  barriers  that  we
have  in  front  of  us  in  Arizona.  I  am  curious  about  the  environ-
mental benefits and the costs, and also, some of the political obsta-
cles that we have to overcome to make this a reality. And for any-
one on the panel to answer, please.

Mr.  BAUER.  Well,  if  you  are  talking  Arizona  specifically,  there
are,  as  I  am  sure  you  are  aware  of  the  geological  resources  to  put
CO2 in and store it, so those possibilities are there, but I think you
made  a  very  important  point  in  your  question,  which  is  the  polit-
ical, and I might say the public receptivity to this. And this is one
of  the  reasons  the  regional  partnerships  were  formulated,  to  both
understand  the  challenges  in  the  geographic  locations  as  well  as
the  geologies,  but  also  to  work  across  the  States  that  are  part  of
it, to work with the communities and the academia to communicate
what they find and what the challenges and what the opportunities
are, so that the public acceptance and political acceptance would be
there,  should  this  process  turn  out,  as  it  seems  to  be,  to  be  a  very
viable solution.

So,  I  think  part  of  it  is  education,  and  then  part  of  that  edu-
cation,  as  you  again  wisely  observed,  is  to  go  where  we  would  like
to  go,  as  far  as  renewables,  will  take  many  decades  to  raise  the
quantity  capability.  How  do  we  keep  the  economy  viable  while  we
do that? We are going to have to use what we have, which is basi-
cally  coal,  natural  gas,  and  others,  which  are  more  carbon  inten-
sive.

Mr. DALTON. I would like to add that we have been working with
the  WESTCARB  Regional  Partnership  in  the  West.  There  is  some
small-scale  work  being  planned  with  Salt  River  Project  as  one  of
the  organizations,  working  with,  again  this  is  the  small-scale  type
of work that the regional partnerships has been excellent at setting
out.  It  helps  in  understanding  the  mechanics,  the  monitoring,  the
verification.  It  helps  in  understanding  the  public  perception  issues
as  well,  but  there  are  geologies  that  run  throughout  certain  parts
of  the  West  that  are  somewhat  similar,  and  so,  there  should  be
quite a bit learned from any large-scale work that follows on wher-
ever  that  is  in  the  West,  that  the  geologies  are  somewhat  similar,
to my understanding, as a chemical engineer, not as a geologist.

Mr. RENCHECK. And I would offer that the initial approach to im-
proved  efficiency  as  a  coal  generating  plants  are  very  important,
and  that  is  the  reason  for  advancing  technology  such  as  the  ultra-
super  critical  plant,  as  well  as  the  IGCC  plants.  And  also,  the  ex-
isting fleet can also be improved from an efficiency perspective, but
at  times,  it  runs  headlong  into  NSR  regulations  about  improving
border  functionalities,  so  you  could  advance  the  existing  fleet  effi-
ciency  if  we  could  get  better  clarity  around  new  source  review  re-
quirements.

FUNDING CONCERNS

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  And  Mr.  Chairman,  if  we  could  just  follow  up
there.  I  am  curious  in  terms  of  the  actual  costs,  and  where  those
costs  would  be  shouldered.  Is  this—would—privately  shouldered,
publicly  shouldered?  Can  the  government  step  in  and  be  helpful
here?

Mr. RENCHECK. On the projects we are proposing, we are looking
for  a  partnership  between  public  and  private  funding.  We  are
working  also  with  technology  providers  who  are  also  putting  some
of their money upfront in the development of technologies.

But  it  is  quite  expensive,  and  any  one  entity  trying  to  push  this
forward  by  itself  isn’t  going  to  be  able  to  do  it,  so  it  does  need  to
be a partnership. We do need to have incentives and funding to be
able  to  progress  technology,  especially  if  we  are  looking  for  it  to
progress in an expedient manner.

Mr. DALTON. One other point, I am not sure if you were here for
the testimony that I gave, but I mentioned that for a current tech-
nology  on  the  pulverized  coal  plant,  adding  capture  and  storage
might  be  an  increase  of  60  to  80  percent  in  the  whole  cost  of  gen-
eration, and for an IGCC, possibly 40 to 50 percent.

Now,  a  lot  of  research,  federal  and  private  efforts,  are  going  to-
ward reducing that cost, but right now, it is a very significant cost.
Now,  that  isn’t  all  of  the  retail  cost  of  energy,  obviously,  but  it
could very significantly add, if it is today’s technology.

Mr. HILL. I would just like to reinforce a couple of points. I think
the  government  has  a  very  important  role  to  play  here  to  enable
this  technology  to  happen,  and  to  happen  quickly,  because  time  is
of  the  essence,  and  the  key  ones,  I  think,  are  regulations  and  pol-
icy,  and  the  need  for  public/private  partnerships  to  co-invest  and
build these large, integrated projects.

They  are  very  large  capital  outlays,  but  for  that,  you  get  very
large reductions in emissions, and that is one of the unique things
about this. You get very large reductions in emissions for one very
large power plant. The downside is there are large capital outlays,
and  that  is  why  you  need  to  have  this  public/private  partnership
sharing the risk and sharing the development of this technology.

Ms.  GIFFORDS.  Chairman,  if  I  can  just  follow  up  really  quickly,
Mr.  Hill,  can  you  give  us  very  specific  examples  where  public/pri-
vate  partnerships  of  this  magnitude  have  been  created  around
other industries, and areas that we can possibly learn from?

Mr.  HILL.  Well,  I  can  give  you  a  couple  of  examples  where  we
were doing that on technology R&D. We have, we formed a public/
private  partnership,  in  fact,  with  the  Department  of  Energy,  prob-
ably  about  six  or  seven  years  ago  now,  where  we  really  embarked
upon a large program to develop new breakthrough technologies to
reduce  the  cost  of  capture,  and  to  prove  that  CO2 could  be  stored
safely.  And  that  involved  eight  different  companies,  the  Depart-
ment  of  Energy,  the  European  Commission,  and  the  Norwegian
government,  who  have  been  working  together  over  the  last  six
years  at  developing  these  technology,  and  it  has  now  got  us  to  the
stage where we are ready to deploy and really demonstrate that at
scale.

And I think that is a great example of where these public/private
partnerships  have  got  into  action  and  produced  some  really  tan-
gible results.

Mr. RENCHECK. I would also offer that FutureGen is off to a good
start  with  public/private  partnerships,  and  it  also  has  an  inter-
national flavor, with participation from both the utility companies,
coal companies, as well as governments.

Ms. GIFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LAMPSON. You are welcome. Thanks, Ms. Giffords, and

now, I will recognize Mr. Wilson.

CARBON CAPTURE FOR COAL TO LIQUIDS

Mr.  WILSON.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  Gentleman,  thank  you
for being here today. I represent the State of Ohio, or Ohio’s Sixth
Congressional  District,  which  is  coal  country  all  along  the  Ohio
River.

We have some interesting things going on there, and I would sort
of like to present them to you, and be interested in your comments.
And the panel in general, not just a specific person.

But  we  have  a  coal  to  liquid  plant  being  proposed  by  the  Baard
Corporation,  and  it  is  going  to  be  in  Southern  Columbiana  and
Northern  Jefferson  County  along  the  Ohio  River,  but  again,  trying
to tie together the Armed Services Contract, who will take the fuel
for jet fuel, and be able to marry the two together, so that the fuel
that  is  produced  will  have  an  automatic  market  for  it.  And  again,
trying to protect the investors, because we are looking at this thing
long-term,  not  just  something  that  if  oil  happens  to  hit  $35  a  bar-
rel, we would have to be able to secure that investment.

That is one thing we are hearing. Another one of the concerns—
and  we  are  very  excited  about  that,  I  might  add—we  also  have  a
new  coal-fired  electric  plant,  a  couple  of  them  in  play  right  now,
and  we  have  a  couple  of  retrofits  that  AEP  are  doing  along  this
Ohio River corridor.

The  question  or,  to  me,  at  least,  the  focus  should  be  politically,
or  from  the  government,  I  should  say,  that  if  oil  is  the  numbers
that  Congressman  Costello  said,  which  are  just  hugely  different  in
what  the  coal  can  produce,  it  would  seem  to  me  that  it  would  be
wise to focus on the research and development of this at this point.
It would be a much less expensive process than to continue sort of
bantering  around,  for  lack  of  a  better  term,  but  I  am  not  sure,  as
a new Congressman, how we do that.

So,  I  am  not  sure  that  you  have  all  the  answers  to  those  ques-
tions, but the other thing I am hearing is sort of a mixed message
on how we do the sequestration. One of them is, in one of my areas,
we have a new process called Powerspan, that has been put in, and
they have drilled a 9,000 foot hole in Shadyside, Ohio there at the
Burger  Plant,  to  do  sequestration,  and  my  understanding  is  that
the  hole  gets  smaller  as  it  gets  deeper.  I  missed  the  first  part,  as
far as pipeline, and I believe, Mr. Chairman, what we were saying
is  that  this  could  be  piped  off  into  other  areas.  It  doesn’t  have  to
be sequestered right onsite. Is that what I am hearing there?

The  second  thing,  in  ways  of  doing,  or  capturing  the  CO2,  was
that  of  the  algae  process,  and  my  understanding  in  dealing  there
with the people at the Voinovich Center at Ohio University, we are

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

59

talking about the algae being applied to, at least this is my under-
standing  of  it,  large  sheets  of  it,  if  you  will,  and  then,  the  carbon
would  be  captured,  and  could  somehow  be  reused,  then,  as  a  coke
in  producing  steel.  So,  just  some  of  those  thoughts,  if  perhaps  you
could help me get some clarity on those. Mr. Rencheck.

Mr. RENCHECK. We are trying to develop an IGCC plant in Meigs
County, Ohio, and had applied for, instead of tax credits, the incen-
tive tax credits were only enough to cover two facilities. Two facili-
ties  won’t  be  enough  to  keep  the  IGCC  technology  advancing.  We
need to have more funding in that area to be able to advance those
plants.

As far as the Powerspan technology, it is very similar in the type
of  technology  that  is  being  produced  by  Alstom,  who  we  have
teamed with. It uses a chilled ammonia process for capturing CO2.
With the hope of the chilled ammonia process, it would reduce the
overall  power  requirements  of  the  plant,  where  Stu  had  said,  up-
wards of 30 percent. Again, we are hoping to get it to a power pen-
alty  of  around  10  to  15  percent,  so  it  would  advance  that.  And
funding is needed to move these projects forward as well, if we are
expecting to do this in a timely manner.

Mr.  DALTON.  Just  to  add,  EPRI  has  also  been  working  with  the
First Energy and Powerspan organization on their past work at the
plant,  and  are  involved  in  the  planning  for  the  next  phase.  This,
again,  is  part  of  the  regional  partnership’s  work  for  injection  of
CO2 at  the  Burger  station.  We  think  that  there  are  a  number  of
promising  technologies.  When  we  did  a  recent  screening,  we  came
up  with  about  three  dozen  different  promising  technologies,  and  I
am  sure  we  didn’t  cover  them  all.  There  are  some  that  are  still  at
different stages of development.

This is an area where we think in parallel, not in the normal se-
quential  arrangement  of  first  you  do  the  very  small-scale  work,
then you do the pilot, then you do the large-scale up, we are going
to have to work on multiple technologies at the same time, with an
aggressive R&D effort, and we have been putting together some of
these  different  plans  for  different  technologies.  I  have  in  my  hand
one that is called CoalFleet, we have a program called that, RD&D,
Augmentation  Plan  for  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle
Power  Plants.  This  has  been  put  in  the  public  domain.  We  have
others  that  we  have  been  working  on  for  combustion.  We  believe
that there are lots of things that need to be pressed right now, and
pressed rapidly, as a public/private partnership.

Mr.  RENCHECK.  As  part  of  a  regional  partnership,  we  have  also
drilled  a  9,000  foot  hole,  just  further  down  the  Ohio  River  on  the
West  Virginia  side,  being  able  to  inject  in  both  of  those  locations
will  give  us  a  very  good  understanding  of  the  rock  formations  and
the capability in the area, in the regional area, of being able to se-
quester and store CO2. So, we are looking to progress both of these
projects as part of the regional partnership.

Mr.  HILL.  One  of  the  things,  I  think  your  other  question  was  fo-
cusing on R&D, and how you get actually things done at this scale.
One  of  the  things  I  can  share  with  this  hearing  is  what  is  being
done in Europe, and the European Commission have set up a tech-
nology platform for zero-emissions power.

And I think two key things have come out of that, well, probably
three key things have come out of that. One is a strategic research
agenda,  identifying  all  the  research  that  is  required.  The  second
one,  I  think,  is  probably  the  most  key,  and  that  is  a  deployment
strategy.  What  needs  to  get  done  to  enable  this  to  be  in  place  and
actually happening at commercial scale by a certain date? And the
third  one  is  setting  a  time  when  this  will  happen.  And  President
Barroso,  in  the  recent  energy  announcement,  in  fact,  earlier  this
year,  announced  that  by  2020,  their  plan  is  to  have  all  fossil  fuel
power  plants  to  require  carbon  capture  and  storage.  Otherwise,
they won’t be permitted.

So,  I  think  that  was,  and  I  mentioned  this  in  my  statement,  I
think  it  is  really  important  to  have  a  plan  and  a  target,  and  a  re-
search and deployment strategy to enable you to achieve that objec-
tive.  And  one  of  the  things  the  platform  in  Europe  has  done  is
brought  together  government,  industry,  utilities,  all  sectors  of  the
industry, as well as equipment suppliers, academics and engineers,
to  work  with  us  together,  given  that  context  and  the  goals  that
have been set.

Mr.  RENCHECK.  Not  deploying  further  coal  generation  would  in-
hibit  and  retard  the  ability  to  make  that  generation  more  efficient
over time. As Mr. Dalton said, working the technologies in parallel
will  help  us  to  get  to  the  end  solution  faster.  And  as  an  example,
in IGCC technology, its first commercial plants will occur with AEP
and  with,  potentially,  Duke  Energy  in  Florida  at  a  600-megawatt
level.  They  have  not  been  built  yet  in  the  States.  Not  to  continue
developing  that  will  slow  the  development  of  the  gasification  proc-
ess  technology,  as  it  integrates  with  the  combustion  turbine  proc-
ess.

Mr. BAUER. If I may, Mr. Chairman. I know your red light is on,

but——

Chairman LAMPSON. Go ahead.
Mr.  BAUER.  The  DOE  has  had  a  plan,  a  roadmap,  to  go  forward
on  these  various  challenges,  and  that  is  part  of  what  the  budget
is based on. Of course, within the limited confines of funding avail-
ability,  we  have  to  make  decisions,  but  the  program  both  develops
technologies  for  efficiency,  as  well  as  carbon  capture,  many  of  the
things  that  were  talked  about,  and  have  all  been  funded  through
the  DOE.  And  the  Powerspan  technologies  is  in  action,  an  NETL
patent that was licensed to Powerspan.

On  the  algae  issue,  there  are  multiple  ways  to  capture,  and  I
think  part  of  the  things  you  are  hearing,  Congressman,  are  that
there  are  multiple  pathways  forward,  and  our  funding  level  con-
straint for parallel production is part of what is slowing the process
down.  So,  going  back  to  what  my  friends  here  are  saying,  trying
to  do  things  in  parallel  costs  more  instantaneously  than  doing
things in series.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Will  you  help  us  push  for  that  additional

funding?

Mr. BAUER. I will do what I can do.
Mr.  WILSON.  Thank  you,  gentlemen.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.

Chairman LAMPSON. You are welcome. Thank you.

I  have  a  number  of  questions,  and  if  you  all  will  keep  your  an-
swers  as  short  as  you  possibly  can,  I  might  be  able  to  make  it
through all of them.

Mr.  Bauer,  how  high  do  you  believe  the  alternative  combustion
technologies DOE is researching, like oxy-combustion, can push the
efficiency of coal, energy efficiency of coal?

Mr. BAUER. I think the issue on the oxy-combustion is we can get
to  several  percentage  points  more  efficiency.  So,  presently,  the  ad-
vanced  power  pulverized  coal  plants  and  IGCCs  are  equivalent  in
efficiency. I think with oxy-combustion, with some improvements in
IGCC, they will both be in the 40 percent plus range over the next
several  decades.  The  thing  that  oxy-combustion  provides  is  to  the
savings  on  the  capture  side,  because  now,  then  you  have  a  higher
concentration of CO2 to capture from a pulverized coal unit, which
is  one  of  the  advantages  the  IGCC  has.  They  have  a  higher  con-
centration  of  CO2 in  their  stream.  So,  that  begins  to  level  those
issues, as far as the price of operation.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  What  progress  has  your  Advanced  Turbine
Program  demonstrated  over  the  last  ten  years,  and  how  close  are
these technologies to commercial scale application?

Mr.  BAUER.  I  am  going  to  ask  Dr.  Strakey  to  speak  up,  because

that is his domain.

Mr.  STRAKEY.  I  think  the  Advanced  Turbine  Program  has  made
some remarkable progress. Originally, it was directed towards nat-
ural  gas,  and  resulted  in  the  H-class  turbines,  which  are  the  most
efficient,  largest  machines  that  are  now  being  demonstrated  at
multiple sites around the world.

What  we  are  trying  to  do  in  the  coal  program  is  take  that  same
kind  of  technology,  and  adapt  it  for  burning  hydrogen,  which  is
what  you  would  have  in  a  zero-emission  plant.  We  are  at  some  of
the  early  stages  of  this  work,  and  we  hope  to  test  some  of  that
technology in FutureGen and other sites as well.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  How  close  to  commercial  scale  application?
Mr. STRAKEY. Well, you can do it commercially now, but you will
take  a  hit  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  emissions.  So,  the  problem  is
how do you get back the couple points of efficiency that you would
lose,  and  keep  NOΧ emissions  very  low,  in  the  parts  per  million,
couple  parts  per  million  range,  so  these  plants  can  be  sited  any-
where in the U.S.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  Mr.  Rencheck,  pulverized  coal
plants  can  achieve  very  high  efficiencies  with  supercritical  or
ultrasupercritical  steam  pressures  and  temperatures  that  can
reach 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit. You mention AEP’s lead on devel-
opment  and  deployment  of  more  efficient  coal  power  plants.  I  un-
derstand  these  extreme  conditions  can  cause  problems  for  the  ma-
terials used in the power plants.

Who  is  conducting  the  primary  research  in  these  areas?  Could
you  explain  some  of  those  material  issues?  Is  there  sufficient  in-
vestment in these advanced technologies, either from the federal or
private?

Mr. RENCHECK. The easiest way to explain it, an existing subcrit-
ical  plant  metallurgy,  if  you  take  it  to  the  ultrasupercritical  level
that  we  are  building  right  now,  at  a  little  over  1,100  degrees,  the
piping system that would normally last 75 years, in a supercritical

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

62

plant  would  probably  last  about  two.  So,  the  metallurgy  advance-
ments  to  get  the  1,400  degrees  take  quite  a  bit  more  research  and
development.  It  is  primarily  being  pursued  in  Europe  and  Asia  at
this point in time, with a little funding in the U.S. It does need ad-
ditional  funding  to  be  able  to  advance  the  metallurgies  and  tech-
nologies forward. There is some work going on with U.S. companies
at  this  point,  but  it  is  not  at  a  level  that  would  advance  it  in  the
near-term.

Chairman LAMPSON. Mr. Dalton.
Mr.  DALTON.  I  might  add,  under  the  sponsorship  over  the  last
about six years from the U.S. Department of Energy, the Ohio Coal
Development  Office  and,  with  a  team  that  includes  the  major  U.S.
boiler  and  now,  turbine  manufacturers,  as  well  as  specialists  in
EPRI as part of that team, and actually leads some of the technical
work,  we  have  been  looking  at  some  of  those,  at  more  advanced
materials.  There  are  very  few  materials,  they  also  tend  to  be  ex-
tremely  high  alloy,  meaning  high  nickel,  and  for  the  same  reason
that  we  have  taken  the  nickel  out  of  the  nickel  in  the  U.S.,  it  has
gotten very expensive, it is very expensive for some of the alloy ma-
terials that are being used worldwide.

And  this  could  significantly  increase  the  cost,  limit  the  number
of alloys that could be used, so what we are looking at is the design
methodologies,  the  tests  in  the  field,  and  right  now,  there  is  not
enough  to  bring  that  to  the  full-scale  demonstration  and  deploy-
ment  stage.  We  are  really  limited  to  the  materials  work  in  the
work that we are conducting right now with DOE.

Mr. RENCHECK. And I would just like to add, the vintage, where
we  are  looking  to  build  here  over  the  next  several  years,  are  al-
ready operating in Germany and Japan. We are behind.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Mr.  Dalton,  in  your  testimony,  you  state
that  the  significant  energy  consumption  required  by  CO2 separa-
tion  processes  and  other  emissions  technologies  can  reduce  a
plant’s  electrical  output  by  as  much  as  30  percent.  Are  there  tech-
nologies that bring about enough production efficiencies so that the
output losses from CO2 separation are offset?

Mr. DALTON. The technologies for capture will almost always use
a significant amount of energy. However, with the advancements of
efficiency,  through  things  like  we  were  just  talking  about  in  the
ultrasupercritical  designs,  the  H  turbine  design,  as  one  example,
the  ion  transport  membrane  for  oxygen  separation,  put  these
things together, and you get a more efficient front end, if you will,
and  a  less  parasitic  load,  or  a  less  consumptive  load  on  the  back
end.  The  overall,  we  believe,  can  mean  that  in  15,  20  years,  you
are  back  up  to  higher  efficiencies  again.  But  there  is  some  con-
sumptive use.

Mr.  RENCHECK.  I  would  like  to  make  one  point,  as  a  retrofit  on
an  existing  plant,  there  are  steam  requirements  for  the  existing
technology  that  can  get  to  the  point  where  the  plant  physically
won’t work, and looking at some of our existing fleet, we believe we
can  only  get  enough  steam  off  the  steam  cycle  to  capture  a  max-
imum of 50 percent carbon.

Chairman  LAMPSON.  Thank  you.  Would  the  work  that  Rick
Smalley  was  doing  at  Rice  University  on  carbon  nanotechnology
be—are you familiar at all?

Mr.  DALTON.  There  again,  there  are  at  least  three  dozen  new
processes. Some of them propose very low energy use or using other
forms of energy, such as the algal growth, which uses solar energy
as part of the overall energy balance.

Chairman LAMPSON. Thank you all. You did good. Ranking Mem-

ber Inglis, it is your turn.

BASIC ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

Mr.  INGLIS.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  You  know,  necessity  is
the  mother  of  invention,  but  it  is  also  true  that  invention  is  pro-
pelled  by  a  can-do  spirit,  and  the  neat  thing  about  being  here  and
hearing you testify is it is obvious that you are out there trying to
solve  these  things,  and  so,  we  are  very  fortunate  to  have  people
like you doing what you are doing.

And  maybe  now  you  can  explain  to  me  the  chemistry  of  carbon
as  said  earlier  I  need  to  understand  the  science  a  little  bit  better.
And  maybe  it  would  help  me  to  have  somebody  tell  me  why  it  is
that  apparently,  carbon  wants  to  hook  up  with  oxygen,  right,  and
to  get  it  to  unhook,  it  takes  some  energy.  But  it  must  be  possible
to hook it with something else, to make it so that it isn’t necessary
to  sequester  it,  or  is  it?  I  mean,  is  anybody  working  on  something
that would cause it to hook with something else, or is there nothing
else that it likes to dance with?

Mr.  BAUER.  Well,  as  you  said,  Congressman,  carbon  and  oxygen
seem  to  like  each  other.  H2O,  of  course,  is  hydrogen  and  oxygen,
but given the choice, more energy is released going to carbon diox-
ide than water, so in fact, shifting the gasification reaction to make
more  hydrogen,  we  pass  steam  through  the  system,  and  it  hooks
up with carbon monoxide, CO, to form water, I mean, to release hy-
drogen  and  have  more  oxygen  and  carbon  combining,  so  the  prob-
lem is that it is a lower state of energy required to have that bond
of  CO2,  so  therefore,  it  is  very  hard  to  break  it  apart  once  it  is
joined.

It is possible, and in fact, some people are looking at taking CO2,
and  using  it  to  reverse  the  process,  which  will  take  energy,  but  if
the  economics  are  right,  because  of  the  pain  of  CO2 in  the  world,
you  could  possibly  make  a  Fischer-Tropsch  fuel  out  of  that.  That
doesn’t  make  sense  in  our  present  economy,  because  of  the  energy
burden, but in the future, it may make sense, because the problem
of CO2 could be so great that the economics drive it the other way.
Mr.  INGLIS.  In  which  case,  the  carbon  itself  has  some  value,  if

you could isolate it.

Mr. BAUER. Yes, most of our fuel, and many other things that we

use, carbon is an essential component of it.

Mr. INGLIS. Right.
Mr. BAUER. Even biomass is basically because of its carbon value

that we use it.

CARBON CAPTURE

Mr. INGLIS. So now, maybe somebody can explain to me the thing
that, I heard a presentation, and I didn’t get it. So, maybe you can
help  me  understand  it,  about  how  it  is  that,  how  pre-combustion
CO2 capture works.

Mr.  RENCHECK.  The  bottom  line  is  the,  in  the  gasification  proc-
ess, you are taking coal, and you are not oxidizing it or burning it.
It  is  more  like  it  is  smoldering,  and  with  that,  it  produces  a  gas.
The  gas  is  primarily  carbon  monoxide  and  water,  and  it  is  under
pressure,  so  it  is  a  pressurized  gas  stream.  The  way  you  would  do
that,  then,  is  as  syngas  goes  forward,  you  shift  it,  and  when  you
shift  it  through  a  Fischer-Tropsch  process,  it  creates  basically  hy-
drogen and CO2 in a pure stream. That CO2 stream is pressurized
already,  so  now,  to  pump  it  in  the  ground  takes  a  lot  less  energy
to  store  it.  And  then,  the  hydrogen  is  used  in  the  combustion  tur-
bine to generate electricity.

Mr. DALTON. Let me try one other analogy. If I had a pretty good
sized power plant, and I made this gas, I take a little bit of oxygen,
not enough to burn it, but a little bit, I react it, I make something
that looks like obsidian, volcanic glass, and it is inert. In the proc-
ess,  I  make  some  hydrogen.  The  gas  is  under  pressure,  and  it  is
high  in  concentration.  I  can  literally  put  my  arms  around  it,  the
size of a duct. However, at the back end of a power plant, the duct
is  more  like  the  size  of  this  room.  It  is  very,  very  large,  and  you
can  just  think  it  takes  more  equipment  to  literally  get  your  arms
around  it.  It  is  a  much  smaller,  more  compact,  cheaper  process  to
capture  it  in  this  pre-combustion,  at  pressure,  with  a  higher  con-
centration  of  CO2,  than  it  is  to  capture  it  afterwards.  But  do  you
want your chemical plant in front or in back, because they are both
really chemical plants.

Mr. RENCHECK. And in the back process, it is basically at atmos-
phere  conditions,  and  in  the  combined  cycle  process,  it  is  com-
pressed down at over 200 pounds, well over 200 pounds.

Mr. INGLIS. Mr. Hill, did you want to add something to that?
Mr.  HILL.  Yeah,  I  was  just  going  to  say  the  same  thing  from  a
different  perspective.  I  mean,  so  pulse  combustion  is  basically  you
burn  the  fossil  fuels,  and  you  have  the  exhaust  gas,  and  you  have
to strip out the CO2 from the exhaust gas, and the challenge is the
CO2 might  only  be  a  small  part  of  that  exhaust  gas.  It  might  10
to  13  percent,  if  it  is  coal,  or  maybe  three  or  five  percent  if  it  is
gas, so you have got a huge volume, and you are trying to just pick
out this 13 or three percent of CO2. That is why that is quite tricky
and quite expensive.

Pre-combustion  is  quite  interesting,  because  pre-combustion  is
basically  you  are  taking,  you  are  developing  a  conversion  process.
You are converting gas, or you are converting a fossil fuel, putting
it through a chemical conversion process to get some other state for
that  fossil  you.  And  if  you  shift  it  the  whole  way  by  using  steam,
you  get,  eventually,  CO2 and  hydrogen.  But  at  other  stages,  there
are other chemicals you can get before you get to the CO2 and hy-
drogen,  so  it  is  quite  a  flexible  technology.  You  could  produce
syngas,  which  you  could  actually  put  in  the  gas  distribution  sys-
tem. You could produce other chemicals for chemical processing, as
well as also making hydrogen for power.

So,  pre-combustion  is  like  a  conversion  process  of  fossil  fuels  to
some  other  chemical  state  you  would  like  that  fossil  fuel  in.  That
does  take  a  lot  of  energy,  and  the  challenge  is  how  you  do  that  in
the most cost-effective and efficient way.

Mr.  INGLIS.  And  I  assume  the  economics  of  that  aren’t  quite
there  at  this  point.  Is  that  right,  or  is  that—how  far  away  are  we
from the economics working on that sort of thing?

Mr. BAUER. Well, I think as both Stu and I have suggested, that
with gasification, we are looking at 30 percent increase in the cost
of  electricity,  so  that  gives  you  a  sense  of  the  economics.  With  an
existing  power  plant,  or  even  a  brand  new  pulverized  coal  plant,
not  oxy-combustion,  because  the  advantage  of  the  oxy  is  you  have
a  higher  concentration  of  CO2 again,  because  you  don’t  put  all  the
nitrogen  in  the  rest  of  the  air,  and  nitrogen  is  70  percent  of  air.
So,  that  is  like  50  to  70  percent,  depending  on  the  design  of  the
plant, the substantial increase in the cost of electricity. And I think
what  is  important  to  realize  is  that  electricity  is  a  low  value  prod-
uct,  and  that  is  dispatches,  whoever  has  the  lowest  price  sells  it,
so  for  someone  like  AEP  to  make  an  investment  on  a  plant  that
they couldn’t dispatch early and recover costs, is a prohibitive hur-
dle  to  get  over  on  their  part,  and  that  is  part  of  the  real  issue  on
trying to move forward on this.

Mr.  RENCHECK.  I  would  just  like  to  add  as  well,  in  the  combus-
tion process for oxy, coal, and IGCC, one of the biggest cost drivers
or inefficiencies of that plant is actually making the oxygen for par-
tial  combustion.  If  you  have  to  take  air  and  separate  the  nitrogen
and  the  oxygen,  you  run  it  through  these  gigantic  compressors,
some  of  which  have  45,000  horsepower  motors,  bigger  than  prob-
ably the size of this room, you actually have to make sure your grid
is  reinforced,  just  so  you  can  start  these  things.  They  are  massive
pieces  of  equipment,  where  some  of  the  R&D  work  that  Carl  was
talking  about,  with  membrane  technology,  that  could  separate  the
air into nitrogen and oxygen, would make that process much more
efficient, and much more economical over time.

Mr. INGLIS. Thank you.
Chairman LAMPSON. The Chair recognizes Mr. Udall.

H.R. 1933, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CARBON CAPTURE
AND STORAGE RESEARCH,  DEVELOPMENT,  AND DEM-
ONSTRATION ACT

Mr.  UDALL.  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  thank  all  you
witnesses for being here. This is a really important and very inter-
esting,  it  goes  without  saying,  and  just  having  been  here  a  few
minutes, it is clear that carbon capture and storage technology has
real promise, particularly when it comes to utilizing these vast coal
reserves that we have.

The  DOE,  as  you  know,  has  been  researching  this  opportunity,
I  like  to  think  of  it  in  that  regard,  through  its  R&D  program,  but
I  think  that  Congress  could  do  more  to  move  the  technology  for-
ward, and to that, I have recently introduced a piece of legislation,
H.R.  1933,  entitled  the  Department  of  Energy  Carbon  Capture  and
Storage  Research  Development  Act,  and  what  I  would  like  to  do  is
ask  you,  Mr.  Bauer,  starting  with  you,  if  you  think  this  approach
would  help  validate  the  technology,  and  move  it  towards  commer-
cialization.

I would, as you begin to speak, that Senator Bingaman has intro-
duced a companion bill in the Senate, and there was a recent hear-
ing that I am referencing with my question.

Mr.  BAUER.  Thank  you,  Congressman.  I  am  familiar  with  1933,
and  Senate  962,  which  are  companion  bills,  and  I  think  both  bills
provide  a  great  deal  of  opportunity  and  are  very  positive  towards
dealing  with  these  issues.  I  appreciate  the  recognition  in  the  bill
of  the  cost  severity  of  trying  to  pursue  this,  which  in  the  Energy
Policy  Act  of  2005,  has  lower  numbers,  but  this  is  a  substantial
problem, and so, the increase that you have recognized in the num-
bers are very good, the recognition of the regional partnership and
the  contribution  they  are  able  to  make,  I  think  is  essential  for  us
moving forward.

We have done a competitive process with both academia and en-
vironmental  agencies,  State  agencies,  and  other  agencies  of  the
government,  National  Labs,  and  these  regional  partnerships  have
formed  around  that,  and  they  have  moved  forward,  and  we  are
about to go into the phase of a million ton per year seven projects.
I  think  you  referenced  that  in  the  bill,  and  that  is  very  exciting.
So, overall, I think both bills provide the opportunity to move more
rapidly  and  aggressively  to  overcome  this  challenge,  and  truly
make it an opportunity.

Mr.  UDALL.  If  anybody  else  on  the  panel  would  like  to  respond,

I would welcome your thoughts.

Dr.  FINLEY.  I  think  1933  also  addresses  that  issue,  and  I  would
like  to  echo  the  sentiments  that  Mr.  Bauer  indicated.  I  think  it  is
really important now that we move forward with the large-scale as-
pect of this, and that takes additional funding. The equipment, for
example,  even  for  a  modest  so-called  large-scale  test,  1,000  ton  a
day  test,  we  need  alone  perhaps  $12  to  $14  million  to  install  the
equipment,  large  compressors  that  are  very  difficult  to  obtain.  In
fact, there is almost a year lead time just to order that equipment.
So,  I  think  funding  of  this  effort  is  extremely  important.  I  think
where there is a much greater recognition, as a result of the three
IPCC  reports  that  have  come  out  since  February,  and  I  commend
the effort to move this forward, particularly at the large scale, and
to fund those efforts at that larger scale.

Mr. UDALL. Anyone else on the panel, or Mr. Bauer, do you want

another——

Mr. BAUER. Yeah, I just wanted to add one other thing. I am try-

ing to recall the many things in looking at the bill.

Mr. UDALL. Sure.
Mr.  BAUER.  And  I  am  hoping  I  am  not  going  to  be  out  of  turn
in  saying  this,  sir,  but  to  do  these  projects  is  going  to  take  more
than  three  years,  and  I  am  sure  you  realize  that  and  understand
the  process,  but  I  didn’t  want  to  be  remiss  in  suggesting  that  this
would be the end of the story. I wish it would be, but it is probably
seven  to  ten  years,  depending  on  how  successful  we  are,  to  get  to
the end.

Mr. UDALL. Well, we are here to improve the legislation that has
been  proposed,  and  that  makes  complete  sense  that  three  years  is
not the only length of time we should be considering. Anybody else
on the panel? Mr. Dalton.

Mr.  DALTON.  While  I  am  not  commenting  on  the  bill  itself,  I
would  point  out  that  capture  is  one  of  the  big  costs.  It  is  almost
as  if  you  can  look  at  two  big  issues,  the  cost  in  energy  use  of  cap-
ture,  and  the  effectiveness  and  assurance  that  you  have  storage

VerDate 11-MAY-2000 19:17 Feb 09, 2008 Jkt 035234 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6601 C:\WORKD\E&E07\051507\35234 SCIENCE1 PsN: SCIENCE1

67

well  in  hand.  Those  are  the  two  big  issues,  and  putting  them  to-
gether is one of the things that we think is very important as well.
It  is  well  enough  to  say  that  yes,  I  can,  the  car  will  perform  this
way,  and  the  tires  will  perform  that  way,  but  you  really  do  want
to  test  them  together.  And  in  this  case,  I  think  that  we  want  to
make  sure  that  large-scale  capture  and  transport  and  storage  are
operated  together,  to  make  sure  that  there  is  good  ability  to  do
that, and operate the system that includes point-to-point transport,
storage, as well as capture.

Mr. UDALL. Excellent point. Mr. Hill, and then we will come back

to Mr. Rencheck.

Mr.  HILL.  Yes,  I  just  want  to  reinforce  that  point.  One  of  the
things  that  BP  has  been  very  active  over  the  last  three  or  four
years,  is  actually  studying  in  a  great  deal  of  depth  the  integration
of  capture  and  storage  systems.  Through  the  two  projects  we  have
proposed,  one  in  Peterhead  in  Scotland,  and  the  other  one  at  Car-
son in Long Beach, California.

And one of the key things we are learning is once we do this de-
tailed  work,  is  the  integration  of  the  various  components  of  the
overall  process,  in  a  way  that  will  have  a  high  degree  of  efficiency
and  a  high  degree  of  operability.  So,  I  think  there  is  only  so  much
you  can  do  by  looking  at  individual  components,  and  there  really
is  a  need  now  to  build  these  very  large-scale,  integrated,  commer-
cial  scale  project  to  prove  the  integration  of  the  various  compo-
nents,  the  operability,  and  the  overall  cost,  and  we  will  only  dis-
cover  it  when  we  actually  build  them,  and  get  really  experienced,
and I think that is the next step for us to take.

Mr.  UDALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  see  my  time  has  expired.  Is  there
time  for  Mr.  Rencheck,  or  will  we  have  another  round,  whatever
works?

Mr.  RENCHECK.  We  have  provided  projects  that  we  are  under-
taking,  and  it  will  take  it  to  scale,  but  as  we  talk  about  that,  we
need  to  also  advance  the  combustion  process  and  the  pre-combus-
tion  process  through  ultrasupercritical  technology  or  IGCC  tech-
nology  in  addition  to  post-capture  or  capture  and  storage  as  well.
Doing  one  without  the  other  only  thwarts  the  technology  advance-
ment going into the future.

MORE ON CARBON SEQUESTRATION RISKS

Mr.  UDALL.  These  are  very  important  points.  Mr.  Chairman,  I
had  a  couple  other  questions.  I  could  submit  them  for  the  record,
or  I  can  direct  them  to  the  witnesses,  depending  on  your  time-
frame.

If  I  could,  and  if  you  all  discussed  this  before  I  arrived,  what  is
the  probability  of  the  carbon  release  from  geological  storage  sites,
and  what  research  and  data  are  available  to  understand  the  envi-
ronmental  and  human  health  and  safety  risks,  and  are  there  well
established  risk  assessment  methodologies  for  geological  storage  of
CO2? Easy questions, I am sure, given the smiles I see on people’s
faces,  and  I  think  Mr.  Hill,  Dr.  Finley,  and  finely,  and  Mr.  Bauer,
you all have some qualifications to speak to. Dr. Finley, I am sorry,
I  have  got,  I  see  it  is  finely  here  and  Finley  here,  so  you  correct
me.

Dr. FINLEY. That is correct. Well, that is an extremely important
issue,  and  it  is,  in  fact,  one  that  DOE  has  funded  work.  The  Na-
tional  Labs,  Lawrence  Livermore  and  Lawrence  Berkeley,  have
both  been  working  on  this  for  some  time,  independent  of  the  Re-
gional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships. We are in the process of
uptaking some of that knowledge into our partnership.

I  think  you  have  to  make  the  distinction  between  the  so-called
catastrophic release that is often cited in the press, the Lake Nyos
example,  I  mean,  I  don’t  think  we  would  decide  to  put  CO2,  inject
CO2 beneath  a  volcanic  lake,  which  is  a  high  risk  situation,  obvi-
ously, and in this case, it was natural CO2, in any event.

The  risks  are  just  beginning  to  be  quantified.  There  is  a  lot  of
detail  work  now  beginning  to  look  at  this,  especially  as  we  move
forward  with  the  large-scale  injections  per  se.  CO2 is  not  flam-
mable,  it  is  not  poisonous,  but  yet,  you  don’t  want  to  fill  a  room
up with it, and walk into the room, and not move out. So, basically,
you  don’t  want  it  coming  up,  obviously,  in  people’s  basements  and
so forth.

My  feeling  as  a  geologist  is  that  the  risk,  there  is  the  natural
risk  posed  by  the  geology  itself,  and  then,  there  is  a  risk  posed  by
the  facilities,  such  as  wells.  I  think  the  risk,  if  we  carefully  site
these projects, and we assess the geology extremely carefully, with
geophysics  and  seismic,  look  to  make  sure  there  are  no  faults  or
fracture zones, I think that risk is relatively low.

I  think  the  larger  risk,  as  we  get  many,  many  of  these  projects,
is  to  make  sure  that  the  manmade  infrastructure,  the  wells,  pipe-
lines, compressors, and so forth are done with the utmost care.

Mr.  UDALL.  Mr.  Chairman,  perhaps  given  the  votes  that  have
been  called,  we  could  submit  the  rest  of  the,  others  could  have,  on
the  panel,  a  chance  to  submit  their  answers  for  the  record.  And  I
have  some  additional  questions  I  would  like  to  submit  for  the
record as well.

Chairman LAMPSON. Without objection, you may do so.
We  want  to  thank  all  of  you  for  appearing  before  the  Sub-
committee  this  afternoon.  And  under  the  rules  of  our  committee,
the  record  will  be  held  open  for  two  weeks  for  Members  to  submit
additional statements and any additional questions that they might

ANSWERS TO POST-HEARING QUESTIONS

Responses by Carl O. Bauer, Director, National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S.

Department of Energy

Questions submitted by Chairman Nick Lampson
Q1. Because  the  existing  fleet  of  coal-fired  power  plants  generate  over  50  percent  of
the Nation’s electricity and are one of the major emitters of greenhouse gases and
other pollutants like mercury, how much funding will be dedicated to retrofitting
the  existing  fleet  to  operate  more  cleanly  and  more  efficiently  in  Fiscal  Year
2008? How does this amount compare to the funds allocated to develop more effi-
cient  technologies  for  coal  generating  power  plants  in  Fiscal  Year  2007?  Could
you  please  elaborate  on  the  specific  efficiency  retrofitting  projects  prioritized  by
the Department of Energy?

A1. The Innovations for Existing Plants (IEP) program supported technology devel-
opment  for  criteria  pollutant  control  technologies  retrofits  to  existing  conventional
power  plants,  in  anticipation  of  regulatory  limits  that  are  now  being  implemented
through the Clean Air Interstate Rule and the Clean Air Mercury Rule. Because the
industry  now  has  strong  regulatory  drivers  to  complete  the  development  on  their
own  and  commercially  deploy  such  technologies,  the  IEP  program  is  terminated.
However,  several  programs  are  funded  in  the  FY  2008  that  target  retrofit  tech-
nologies  for  carbon  capture,  or  that  target  technologies  for  new  plants,  but  are  also
applicable  to  retrofit  applications.  In  FY  2008,  the  Department  plans  to  issue  a
Clean  Coal  Power  Initiative  (CCPI)  Round  3  solicitation  that  would  provide  the  op-
portunity for proposing projects to retrofit carbon capture technology, with ultra low
emissions, such as mercury capture, to existing plants. However, since the selections
require a competitive process it is not yet known how much will be awarded for ret-
rofits. In FY 2007, the focus of the $414M coal R&D program is on the development
of  cleaner,  more  efficient  technologies  for  coal  generating  power  plants,  and  carbon
sequestration.  In  each  of  the  years  FY  2007  and  FY  2008  approximately  $7M  is
being allocated to Advanced Research Materials to improve the efficiency of new and
existing  plants.  The  carbon  sequestration  program  also  funds  development  of  post-
combustion carbon capture technologies that could be applied as retrofits.
Q2. A 2007 interdisciplinary MIT Study ‘‘The Future of Coal’’ states that ‘‘It is crit-
ical  that  the  government  RD&D  program  not  fall  in  the  trap  of  picking  a  tech-
nology  ‘‘winner’’  especially  at  a  time  when  there  is  great  coal  combustion  and
conversion  development  activity  underway  in  the  private  sector  in  both  the
United  States  and  abroad.’’  IGCC  has  received  extensive  DOE  support  through
grants  and  FutureGen  funding.  What  is  the  Department  doing  to  advance
oxyfuel  technology,  given  that  it  can  be  used  on  all  coal  types  on  both  existing
and new plants and could be deployed soon?

A2. DOE  does  not  pick  technology  winners.  Rather,  in  response  to  environmental
drivers such as climate change, the Department’s research programs provide a port-
folio  of  technology  options  that  could  be  applicable  under  a  variety  of  future  regu-
latory  and/or  policy  scenarios.  This  allows  the  marketplace,  once  regulations  have
been  promulgated,  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  technologies  for  commercial
deployment,  based  on  performance  and  cost.  Integrated  gasification  combined  cycle
(IGCC)  technology  is  an  important  option  being  developed  by  DOE,  applicable  to  a
wide range of coal types. For example, the Department’s Clean Coal Power Initiative
includes a 285 MWe IGCC project to demonstrate technologies capable of major effi-
ciency  gains  for  low-rank,  high-moisture,  high-ash  coals.  Oxyfuel  or  oxy-combustion
technology also is being investigated and DOE has several projects underway in this
area.
Q3. The DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory in Albany, Oregon has devel-
oped the Integrated Pollutant Removal (IPR) technology. It is my understanding
that tests show that when coupled with Oxyfuel, the hybrid Oxyfuel/IPR system
can remove 90 percent of the mercury, 99 percent of the sulfur, 99 percent of the
particulate  including  80  percent  of  the  PM2.5,  and  NOΧ measured  at  the  exit
of  the  combustion  process  was  0.088  lbs/MMBtu.  I  further  understand  that  the
Oxyfuel/IPR system is also fully capture ready. Please explain any discrepancies
the  Department  may  have  with  the  information  I  provided  on  the  IPR  system.
When does the Administration anticipate the IPR technology will move forward
from development to commercial deployment? Will the Department need to dedi-
cate  additional  funding  to  the  IPR  technology  before  it  is  ready  for  commercial

applications? To date, what level of funding has been used for the Department’s
development of the IPR technology?

A3. Results from bench-scale development and testing and preliminary engineering
analyses  suggest  that  the  IPR  is  a  promising  concept  for  reducing  emissions  from
coal-fired  power  plants.  Based  on  bench  testing  to  date,  Albany  has  achieved  NOΧ
combustion levels at the exit of the combustion process of 0.088 lb/MMBtu; >99 per-
cent  of  sulfur  were  removal;  and  >99  percent  removal  of  particulate  matter.  How-
ever,  it  needs  to  be  stressed  that  ‘‘bench-scale’’  results  are  not  necessarily  an  accu-
rate  prediction  of  commercial  results.  Coupled  with  oxyfuel  combustion  to  generate
a  more  concentrated  CO2 flue  gas,  the  IPR  concept  is  one  of  a  number  of  advanced
carbon  capture  technologies  being  investigated  under  DOE’s  research  program.  As
noted in your question, NETL’s Albany research laboratory has been supporting the
development  of  the  IPR.  Currently,  through  a  Congressionally  Directed  Project,  Ju-
piter  Oxygen  Corporation  has  teamed  with  NETL  to  integrate  oxy-combustion  with
IPR at the Jupiter’s test facilities in Hammond, Indiana. The timing for commercial
deployment  of  oxyfuel/IPR  technology  is  highly  uncertain.  It  will  be  depend  on  the
results  from  the  Jupiter  effort,  any  follow-on  pilot  and  larger  field  testing  over
which  the  DOE  program  has  some  control;  and  on  other  factors  outside  the  control
of DOE. Finally as with many of the advanced carbon capture technologies the pri-
vate  sector  also  needs  to  resolve  numerous  issues  before  the  oxyfuel/IPR  concept  is
considered  a  viable,  cost-effective  CO2 mitigation  strategy.  Because  of  all  these  un-
certainties it is difficult to predict whether the Department will need to dedicate ad-
ditional funding to the IPR technology before it is ready for commercial applications.
To  date,  $3  million  has  been  spent  for  the  Department’s  development  of  the  IPR
technology.
Q4. Older  natural  gas  fueled  power  plants  built  since  1950  surround  many  cities
and  contribute  to  NOΧ and  CO2 pollution.  Is  it  possible  to  retrofit  these  older
gas plants with oxyfuel technology and if so, what would be the emissions reduc-
tions  benefits?  If  the  older  gas  plants  were  retrofitted  with  oxyfuel  technology
what  steps  would  be  necessary  to  provide  for  capture  of  the  CO2?  What  are  the
cost estimates for adding carbon capture technology to these facilities? Is the De-
partment  exploring  other  technologies  to  reduce  emissions  from  gas  fueled  elec-
tric power plants?

A4. It might be possible to retrofit some older natural gas plants with oxyfuel tech-
nology,  and  there  might  be  emissions  reductions  benefits  to  this  approach.  If  gas
plants were retrofitted with oxyfuel technology the necessary steps would begin with
a  feasibility  study  and  comparison  with  alternative  feasible  alternatives.  DOE  has
not  performed  cost  estimates  for  retrofitting  older  natural  gas  plants  with  oxyfuel
technology. The focus of DOE’s carbon capture R&D effort is on technology applica-
ble to coal-based power systems. This is because coal-fired power plants provide over
half of the electricity generated in the United States, and their significant contribu-
tion to the United States’ electricity grid is expected to continue through the better
part  of  this  century.  It  is  recognized,  however,  that  CO2 is  also  emitted  from  other
stationary  fossil-fuel-combustion  facilities,  including  natural-gas-fired  boilers.  As
such,  it  is  expected  that  the  advanced  post-combustion  carbon  capture  technologies
under development as part of DOE’s Carbon Sequestration Program will have appli-
cation  to  natural-gas-fueled  power  plants.  Oxy-combustion  is  one  such  technology.
The  technical  and  operations  issues  associated  with  oxyfuel  combustion,  which
DOE’s  R&D  program  is  addressing,  would  be  similar  for  a  gas-fired  boiler  as  for  a
coal-fired  boiler.  An  important  technical  challenge  is  developing  materials  to  with-
stand increased temperature in the furnace resulting from burning the fuel (coal or
natural gas) in an oxygen-rich environment.

Flue  gas  recirculation  is  one  approach  being  investigated  to  reduce  the  tempera-
ture,  another  approach  is  the  development  of  new  materials  more  resistant  to  high
temperatures.  Another  critical  issue  associated  with  oxy-combustion  is  obtaining  a
large  supply  of  low-cost  oxygen.  Current  oxygen  production  systems,  such  as  cryo-
genic,  are  prohibitively  expensive.  This  is  another  area  of  research  under  DOE’s
Carbon Sequestration Program.
